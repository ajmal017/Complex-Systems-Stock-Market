90 2018-01-30 23:22:05 So let me get this straight... because governments invented digital value as fiat we call it an asset, because wallstreet did the same with digital stocks we call them assets...but because bitcoin was not from either it is not an asset? Not sure i follow your logic.

99 2018-01-30 23:17:14 The stock market is where most retirement plans are, at least in part, placed to try to increase their value. The stock market is also where our larger companies divest their stocks in order to raise revenue to hire more workers purchase more equipment and increase productivity.

124 2018-01-30 23:03:14 AMD's forecast was too strong - its over - they are not going lower unless all stocks crater - i know their business model - they are holding a killer result with a killer forecast - the analysts will figure this out in the next few days.
125 2018-01-30 23:03:08 Trump's director of the Centers for Disease Control Brenda Fitzgerald, which tries to reduce smoking, bought and sold tobacco stocks during her tenure. What a collection of ass-wipes than these Trump nominees! Almost as disgusting as Trump itself.

133 2018-01-30 23:00:54 What happened with the stocks going down 400 points
134 2018-01-30 23:00:40 Any stocks and mutual funds you have. The market is at or near a top. Take your profits, wait for the crash and then buy again at the bottom. Repeat over and over for 40 years.

136 2018-01-30 22:59:42 Bump stocks are not the problem.  But whatever feel-good legislation you find, we can defeat.
137 2018-01-30 22:59:14 Then why did health care stocks fall??? Going towards SINGLE PAYER??
138 2018-01-30 22:58:39 crypto is a double edged blade, one side is fear, it can split a single hair, and the other side is opportunity, it can shave a spider’s ass. if you prefer butter knives get into stocks.

147 2018-01-30 22:56:49 One of my friend ask me: what is your favourite stock? i said: i dont have one and you should not have one either. You cant be in love with one stock because when that stock will go down, your emotions will control you. Each stock should have the same importance. #Stocks #success
148 2018-01-30 22:56:40 Healthcare stocks drop on the news that Amazon, JPM and Berkshire are forming a healthcare company for their workers.  

Proving once again that the market hates anything with a remote chance of helping actual people.
149 2018-01-30 22:56:31 Btw “The Hill”. Stocks have not “skyrocketed under Trump”. The market has been rising at the same rate over the past 3 years. Thanks Obama!
150 2018-01-30 22:56:19 How about some common sense gun control laws?
No one needs automatic rifles.

No one needs bump stocks.

No guns for mentally ill. 

And what happened to the russian sanctions?
151 2018-01-30 22:56:14 I'm a bull on $thcx but I've seen this is nat gas stocks like $pony do a financing around $5.50 less than a year ago and trading at $2 levels today...
152 2018-01-30 22:55:57 it is publicly traded ..do stockholders get a say? (real Q...I dont know how stocks work)
153 2018-01-30 22:55:07 Good grief, is that news? Stocks fall for *2 days*?
154 2018-01-30 22:54:32 Why aren’t you talking about stocks today? jr? LOCK THE LYING FAMILY UP!!!!AND FRIENDS! LOCK THEM ALL UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LOCK THEM ALL UP!
155 2018-01-30 22:54:29 Buy stocks
156 2018-01-30 22:54:19 Typo on tickets invites attendees to 'State of the Uniom'.    Stocks r getting crushed in their worst day since Brexit. Dow dropped 400+ points, or 1.4%, on Tuesday. It's on track for its worst % loss since May. The Dow has not lost more than 373 points since Nov 2016 election.
157 2018-01-30 22:52:34 Seeing what the Dow did today I keep hearing @kairyssdal in the back of my head saying "stocks go down too yall".
158 2018-01-30 22:52:34 Like our President who will say stocks went up but in reality it didn’t.
159 2018-01-30 22:49:05 Soy super nuevo Adolfo y aun no entiendo, pero segun veo los graficos en FSC, las 3 han estado haciendo buenas consolidaciones y fases en tendencia, entiendo que nunca os la jugais con el stop verdad? O por lo menos siempre le teneis a la misma distancia..

161 2018-01-30 22:47:45 Yep and all the guys like UNH and Anthem whose stocks are up 500% since Obamacare
162 2018-01-30 22:47:38 How powerful was Amazons health care announcement today? The news sent all other healthcare stocks down to the tune of a $74 billion market cap hit. #TheAmazonEffect

165 2018-01-30 22:47:01 The Dow has fallen for 2 days in a row, dropping a total of 540 points (-2.0%), making this the biggest 2 day fall since 9 September 2016, 349 trading days earlier #stocks
166 2018-01-30 22:46:32 My hair is on fire over Newtown, Vegas, UVA, Columbine, the recent Sutherland TX shooting and so many more. Folks at least stand a chance if they aren’t facing semi-automatics with or without bump stocks.
And if u can afford the gun u should also afford the training.
167 2018-01-30 22:46:31 Partisan nonsense. Stocks up across two administrations. One you tout, one you criticize. But the money spends the same either way. Also, claiming the DJIA as Trump's accomplishment means he owns the (inevitable) correction too.
168 2018-01-30 22:46:06 You know what is more concerning? You've got 17.5% in T-bills amortized over the fiscal year, 8% in stocks and bonds. Carry the 9, divide by the Gross National Product... fortunately, funeral bouquets are deductible.

172 2018-01-30 22:42:53 WYNN did you start trading stocks?  
173 2018-01-30 22:42:15 ください！
174 2018-01-30 22:41:13 Of the economy? Have you lived here? Companies have been announcing record profits for years. I can start looking up examples but have you not lived here?

I'm confused what you want checked. Wall Street has been doing excellent for the last 5 years. Stocks have been up.
175 2018-01-30 22:40:09 Today’s WRAP:

Stocks : raped except $AMZN $TSLA
Forex : depends who you ask 
Futures: raped 
#Bitcoin: gangbanged 

Good luck.
176 2018-01-30 22:39:39 Stocks have already priced in expectations of future growth. That tends to get ugly when that future growth looks less certain. 

Gonna be some volatility, I would suspect.
177 2018-01-30 22:39:31 Long stocks and short $VIX is the call
178 2018-01-30 22:36:08 All that said, I've since seen operators trained with bump stocks who can achieve performance near what was seen in Vegas, so it is a plausible explanation. The reload speed, weapon swaps and lack of jams is impressive though.
179 2018-01-30 22:35:47 As Nikon no longer stocks parts to repair the F100, you may want to check with an authorized repair station to see if they would be able to repair your F100.  Sometimes they have stock on parts.

192 2018-01-30 22:31:36 401ks and stocks are literally the same number for many people. And the last two days were very bad for both. Pension plans? Uh, OK. Here in 1970 those are a major consideration. Also, "much higher pay" is not in the statistics yet.

194 2018-01-30 22:30:51 The 300 point drop has nothing to do with economy. It is because healthcare and insurance stocks plunged because Bezos, Dimon, Buffet are creating a company in the healthcare space and they’re fretting the competition. Do your goddamn homework.
195 2018-01-30 22:30:26 Is it a coincidence? Stocks rise up to record, Russia get pissed then stocks drop off. How much Russian money is buying stocks for Trump?
196 2018-01-30 22:29:55 Considering the inflows are running choke off, and a lot of that crude is needed for blending, and the over-all stocks are getting lighter and lighter, it matters, but not in the way people are thinking it matters.  Not only is there less oil, it is even less of the oil needed!
197 2018-01-30 22:29:25 He will be talking about how better the country is under this admin.  what are you resisting?  50% gain in stocks, 40% in your 401k, ISIS 98% killed, secure border, more jobs, tax break, more companies moving back, more energy?? #MAGA #SOTU You are probably better off too
198 2018-01-30 22:29:06 I keep telling people that the stocks my mom bought of Chrysler back when everyone thought they were going under have just paid me more in dividends than ever before. 20x more.

200 2018-01-30 22:28:04 Stocks biggest drop in 8 months.... Since every stock market rise past year was result of Trump policies, today’s fiasco is clearly caused by Clinton and her emails, right?
201 2018-01-30 22:27:39 POLL: Which dip did you buy today: bitcoin or stocks?
202 2018-01-30 22:27:37 Eso esta muy bien, hay que mostrar tambien cuando se pierde
203 2018-01-30 22:27:36 if by some chance gold can catch up on downside to gold stocks, and follow TIPS.
204 2018-01-30 22:27:28 The stock drop is due to rich  Democrats and liberals selling their stocks in order to cause a drop and take win away from Trump before #SOTU
205 2018-01-30 22:27:18 @LindaSuhler This is normal stock market fluctuations to match the economic trend and  times... apples announcement was coming they discussed it last week; and some health care  stocks released results below expectations, as did some tech stocks.
206 2018-01-30 22:27:16 Got an answer for why stocks are up a THIRD since this President was elected?
207 2018-01-30 22:27:05 Even though today was the worst day of 2018 for #US #stocks, the Dow and S&P are still on pace for their longest monthly win streak since 1959. The NASDAQ is on pace for its best month since October 2015.
208 2018-01-30 22:27:04 Bingo. Health stocks took a beating today.
209 2018-01-30 22:26:43 @MelissaLeeCNBC @CNBCFastMoney 

Hi Melissa

I have a question for you and your team. What moving average do stocks rebound off most often? 50 day? 100 day? 200 day?

Thanks
210 2018-01-30 22:26:35 Thanks for your support. Lovely cheese In london @NealsYardDairy stocks @ErringtonCheese

212 2018-01-30 22:25:49 Sold out of some AAPL today before it tanks more. Repositioning to small cap NASDAQ, OTC stocks. No dip buying on high priced S&P, DOW.
213 2018-01-30 22:25:06 He will be talking about how better the country is under this admin.  what are you resisting?  50% gain in stocks, 40% in your 401k, ISIS 98% killed, secure border, more jobs, tax break, more companies moving back, more energy?? #MAGA #SOTU You are probably better off too
214 2018-01-30 22:24:56 My stops are my protection. I went short because the general market is vulnerable, but as long as my stocks act normal, I stick with them. Yes, it will likely soften the blow on the longs if the market unravels. But Like I said, it's a hedge by default.
215 2018-01-30 22:24:21 He will be talking about how better the country is under this admin.  what are you resisting?  50% gain in stocks, 40% in your 401k, ISIS 98% killed, secure border, more jobs, tax break, more companies moving back, more energy?? #MAGA #SOTU You are probably better off too
216 2018-01-30 22:23:47 @timseymour “the investor” u mean DIY trader? Maybe they don’t have cash but the advisor driven client is only HALF invested in balanced account. There’s plenty of $$ that COULD rotate into more stocks
217 2018-01-30 22:23:47 @MarkRuffalo Mark, why are you mucking with our President. He is the fireball in raising my stocks and helping American business be more competitive and so many other positive actions. When he succeeds all of us succeed. You have just lost a fan, get off your unappreciated stand
218 2018-01-30 22:23:26 You’re too scared to offer “illegal immigration, isis, economy, stocks, jobs, military, “ to those options
219 2018-01-30 22:23:16 Understandable. Fortunately for me, I was able to get in stocks a few years ago and I guess you could say I was somewhat lucky in the fact I made good company choices holding for long investments and made money. Day trading is a completely different strategy for sure.
220 2018-01-30 22:22:05 Hopefully sellers stay in control of MMJ stocks, would like to see more reasonable P/E before buying stock and options again

224 2018-01-30 22:21:17 You people should take a step back. Penny stocks are trading in the non-crypto economy. I ask this question in good faith and without malice, why are you here?
225 2018-01-30 22:21:12 Warren Buffet shook up healthcare stocks
226 2018-01-30 22:21:10 Stupid is what stupid does. No wonder we are last in environment now, lowest in growth around the world and stocks going down now. They realize the putz president

228 2018-01-30 22:20:48 I don’t know why more of my generation doesn’t just soak some left over money into  amazon, Netflix, Apple, (big fang stocks) because the returns are decent on them...I put away $20 a week from my part time job at Starbucks into stocks, $20 into a retirement fund, 5% paycheck401k

230 2018-01-30 22:20:27 Removing ethane stocks and new line fill (crude oil in pipeline needed for the pipeline to work that cannot be used as inventory but is counted in it) US Crude + Product inventories = Average of 2012 - 2014. And we are building at a slower rate. #OOTT
231 2018-01-30 22:20:04 Stocks market took a huge dive today too.
232 2018-01-30 22:19:38 I’ve got the answer why the stock market drop. A bunch of wealthy libs taking profits yesterday and today make sure the market drops just before the State of the Union. Then these wealthy libs repurchase the stocks at a cheaper price & make more money 
233 2018-01-30 22:18:43 When stocks go down on news it can sometimes be a good buy.

When stocks go down for no obvious reason, run!

238 2018-01-30 22:16:06 Not true, Sen. Blunt.  We saw a steady growth in the market and a stead decline in unemployment.  We did see stagnant incomes, but I don't see that changing with a few bonuses.  Most American families do not have stocks, so the market is not a big deal to them.
239 2018-01-30 22:15:50 Thank you so much. Do you know of a good place that stocks them where I could go and have a look/run up and down the road to see how they feel?
240 2018-01-30 22:15:37 Stocks close sharply lower falling from record highs as gains take a pause.
241 2018-01-30 22:14:51 When someone says that leading stocks will sell-off 1.5 to 2.5 times what the major averages are doing, keep in mind that is just a general rule of thumb taken from O'Neil's HTMMIS. Ultimately, your guide for any position are your trailing and absolute stops...
242 2018-01-30 22:13:59 It's only a hedge by default because short and long oppose each other. But the market could go up and my stocks could go down or vice versa.  Sorry to disappoint you but, IT'S NOT A HEDGE!
243 2018-01-30 22:13:45 Thanks for the dip in health care stocks tho!

248 2018-01-30 22:10:40 NEW YORK (Reuters) - World stocks declined in their biggest two-day dive in 16 months on Tuesday as tumbling oil prices and a jump in global borrowing costs cooled the year’s euphoric start in financial markets.
249 2018-01-30 22:10:15 Market II: Among #commodity plays, many #oil and #gas E&P #stocks showed price gaps lower in heavy trade. At this point, watch for potential reversals higher, bounces off the 50-day MA among the top-rated #energy names. Such action would be bullish $CLR $CXO $FANG $EOG $UNT

262 2018-01-30 22:04:37 It's so tough with individual stocks. They can act like they have a mind of their own. I generally stick to ETF's and indexes. If I put on a position on a stock, it's usually really small. Learned that the hard way.
263 2018-01-30 22:04:22 Hey elonmusk can we swap our coins with Tesla stocks .
You are doing great stuff for all humanity
264 2018-01-30 22:03:47 So, is it like a stock ticker? Donation totals go up or down, like stocks, based on something he may say/promise during the #SOTU ? For instance, "oh ouch, there goes the solar industry after he just promised more coal jobs" or such. #PendejoInChief #PartyofStupid
265 2018-01-30 22:03:29 But I'm bringing home $10 more a week. I'll just be buying stocks left and right!

269 2018-01-30 22:00:44 (1/2) The model I like to sort of simplify the notion of what goes o­n in a market for common stocks is the pari-mutuel system at the racetrack... a pari-mutuel system is a market. Everybody goes there and bets and the odds change based o­n what's bet.
270 2018-01-30 21:59:58 LOL!! Much to the amazement of FinTwit traders, there were a few stocks that actually went up today
271 2018-01-30 21:59:31 BREAKING: Stocks extend losses, Dow Jones falls more than 400 points...HERE WE GO....CRASSSSHHHHH !
272 2018-01-30 21:58:59 GLOBAL MARKETS-Stocks slide again on rising bond yield pressure #energy #oil
273 2018-01-30 21:58:57 We had intended you to be
The next Prime Minister but three:
The stocks were sold; the Press was squared:
The Middle Class was quite prepared.
But as it is! . . . My language fails!
Go out and govern New South Wales! (Belloc)
274 2018-01-30 21:58:54 BREAKING: Stocks extend losses, Dow Jones falls more than 400 points #BREXSHIT MEANS EXIT !
275 2018-01-30 21:58:51 Someone is in the ask with 23000 shares, there is dumping happening
276 2018-01-30 21:58:47 Yes,mostly due to health care stocks dropping because of buffet,bezos, jp morgan. Oh wait it’s easier to say it’s DJT fault. lol
277 2018-01-30 21:58:02 The market dropped primarily because of the healthcare announcement made by Amazon, BH, and JPMC which sent healthcare stocks plunging. Not that I’m not always looking for something to bash Trump with...
278 2018-01-30 21:57:25 *API IS SAID TO REPORT U.S. CRUDE STOCKS +3.23M BBL LAST WEEK
279 2018-01-30 21:57:25 No, healthcare stocks took a hit after Amazon news.
280 2018-01-30 21:56:10 DOWN second day in a row over 360 pts. Big deal, most of the people don't own stocks. Five percent of the people own more than half and 35 percent are foreigners who own it. Let it fall to ground as it will not hurt most of us, just the rich.
281 2018-01-30 21:55:14 Oh dear, is everyone going to come out of GDC in one piece, or do I need to mentally prepare for the worst?
*stocks up on tequila just in case*

283 2018-01-30 21:54:34 @realDonaldTrump It looks like the Democrats sold some stocks today and yesterday to try to make you look bad before your State of the Union address!
284 2018-01-30 21:54:13 It’s probably the corrupt Democrats selling off all of the illegal stocks they purchased
285 2018-01-30 21:54:00 Do you get excited or scared when the stock market crashes? #yvr #stocks #invest
286 2018-01-30 21:53:52 My bf did it all the time daytrading stocks, I noticed this was possible with the crypto and the variance in price. Has to be a significance variance to make it worth it.
287 2018-01-30 21:53:40 @TemptationsCats How much are stocks in your company? My cat is addicted. We buy so many, may as well make money on it! 
288 2018-01-30 21:53:13 @StockDreamz We as a team look for a few stocks out of thousands. If they are able to be played for a Day Trade. Comprende? Or still lost
289 2018-01-30 21:53:07 At drinks with some friends and we've been talking about weed stocks and cryptocurrency for the past 30 mins. End of cycle type of shit.
290 2018-01-30 21:52:46 Remember these names in Nov.  We will turn them into laughing stocks like Sen Ron Johnson of WI.
291 2018-01-30 21:51:37 Maybe not a good day to boast sbout stocks.
292 2018-01-30 21:51:32 The health insurance sector is so over-priced that just the mere hint of Amazon entering their space sent stocks tumbling. REAL competition in this sector is long over-due
293 2018-01-30 21:51:02 The rally since July is facing its potential biggest challenge. US crude #oil exports and lower imports from Canada has delayed the inevitable seasonal rise in stocks. Next will be timing of when prod hit 10m b/d.
294 2018-01-30 21:50:58 We created a mail campaign last week for a wealth management company that advocated for investing in marijuana stocks.
295 2018-01-30 21:50:48 Unlike investment in infrastructure (worth borrowing money), this $1.5 Trillion increase in debt is an investment in absolutely nothing. Companies invest in technology to replace workers with automation, companies buy back stocks, wealthy buy huge estates, country gets nothing.
296 2018-01-30 21:50:44 Comme c’était en quantité limitée je pense qu’il n’y a plus de stocks mais je t’envoie en MP ce que ça m’a dit, ça a l’air sérieux!
297 2018-01-30 21:50:33 Lies. Bragging lies. Clinton being mentioned. How the stocks are up. And more lies. That sounds about right.
298 2018-01-30 21:50:23 What a useless bunch of twats bad show should be put in the laughing stocks at Highbury Corner
299 2018-01-30 21:49:50 In finance class we have various stocks, conversion rates, prices, etc displayed on a tv. Today I said, “Hey! Corn and soybean prices are up!” It only took 5 strange looks for me to remember I wasn’t in Goodhue anymore.
300 2018-01-30 21:49:48 Mario knows more about stocks than 1000 analysts.  You can tell that he enjoys his job
301 2018-01-30 21:49:46 I'm expecting a huge surge in defense company stocks tomorrow after Trump lays out his defense plans in the #SOTU #LLL #NOC #UTX #COL #RTN
302 2018-01-30 21:49:12 Gotta buy them Hoyer stocks for when TB’s hand spontaneously explodes after 2 mins! 
303 2018-01-30 21:48:45 Sold them all! Invested in stocks and shares because I’m a legend
304 2018-01-30 21:48:43 *You're. I'm not going to sit here and argue with you about facts sir. What specific trade deals by Trump have positively affected the current economy? I'll wait... Tax cuts, deregulation have had a big affect on stocks, I give him that. But he can take credit for NOTHING else.
305 2018-01-30 21:48:35 We should all be invested heavily in flu stocks.  Take care of yourself and get better soon.
306 2018-01-30 21:48:34 In The Market: In today's decline, #commodity plays weighed a bit more on the #sp500 (-1.1%), #nyse comp (-1%) than on the #nasdaq (-0.9%). Breadth was worse on NYSE as well; losers beat winners nearly 4-1. Nasdaq losers top winners 3-1 #stocks #steel #oil #metals #ores
307 2018-01-30 21:48:12 Have to follow up and see what stocks dropped and are scooped back up this week.
308 2018-01-30 21:48:03 looked at #stocks, #dow is up 50% in a year. All of the sudden, #crypto doesn't seem so bubbly anymore.
309 2018-01-30 21:47:56 I do wonder if he is the scapegoat.....I want the ring leader....in the stocks.
310 2018-01-30 21:47:44 Wait, I bet "Insider trading" may be another charge on them, if the @FBI is paying attention! They are also trying to manipulate the markets with false information. Hence the plummeting of stocks today. Almost 400 points lost...
311 2018-01-30 21:47:43 Stocks Suffers Through More to Pats' dynasty?
312 2018-01-30 21:47:30 @adam_stocks_ So good to be able to sit down with @carlstubbs92 tommorw and not have to worry about my VC status - if we don't get relegated see you next season
313 2018-01-30 21:47:25 Crypto is down

Late for work this morning
Already canceled stream to do NPA GFX tonight

Today blows. February come sooner.
314 2018-01-30 21:47:14 @WhiteHouse Trusts should be line of credits also. And become with a credit card also. Where the owner has to assign all the stocks by finger prints.
315 2018-01-30 21:46:13 The top five stocks that fell today were $MET, $PFG, $HOG, $CI, and $CHK.
316 2018-01-30 21:45:58 Thankful only family stocks go to the state taxes there. My state taxes aren't great by any means, but nowhere near that level.
317 2018-01-30 21:45:23 The top five most active stocks today were $HRS, $WYNN, $HCA, $QRVO, and $DOV.
318 2018-01-30 21:44:50 i do think 10 yr is going to 3%+ by 2019,but Im not sure how bad that hurts stocks.  I think it depends how fast 10 yr gets to that yield.  if its slow then I dont think it hurts stock market as much.  Its why today I mentioned if they go down together, thats fuel to both fires
319 2018-01-30 21:44:48 Penny stocks drained you
320 2018-01-30 21:44:44 The top five most active stocks today were $AMD, $GE, $BAC, $CHK, and $F.
321 2018-01-30 21:44:26 Took my focus off pot stocks just long enough to grab some $uvxy $11 March 2nd Cs yesterday morning. Up a lot. But think it’s got one more good thrust higher. We shall see.
322 2018-01-30 21:44:20 Another excellent progress day for several Watch List stocks: $PJET .0006s+.0007s gone - only 11M left at .0008 / $OTTV .0010s gone - .0011s half gone / $DGWR hold back MMs moved up from .4050 to .4600 / $BTGI less than 300K left at .0012 / $MFST scaling in off-bottom continues
323 2018-01-30 21:44:17 Uhh should I sell all my stocks? Or ride this out?
324 2018-01-30 21:43:33 Yes girl my sis put in less than 500 and is up over 11k from stocks!
325 2018-01-30 21:43:26 wonder if tonight, while bragging about stocks and employment numbers being up, how many will realize the Debt numbers are up even more so, and being employed now loses more $ than than it makes for the organism overall.
326 2018-01-30 21:43:17 $SMG are plunging 15% after the company reported disappointing #earnings.

328 2018-01-30 21:41:11 I’m wondering if DT has stocks in benzodiazepines since most sane Americans need them now.
329 2018-01-30 21:41:02 You should probably use total return for stocks if you use total return for commodities. Puts stocks sky high. No reason whatsoever to expect the same long term return though.
330 2018-01-30 21:40:18 Rip stocks, rip tether, rip bitcoin, long live top ramen
331 2018-01-30 21:39:56 Might be worth doing the same with a couple of stocks to better understand the financial press (and make it less soporific)
332 2018-01-30 21:39:33 Correction fear? ANZ summarises: The combination of profit taking into month end, higher bond yields, stretched valuations and potential US health-care shake-up were the main drivers #ausbiz #XJO #investing #stocks #equities

335 2018-01-30 21:39:09 Anybody besides me think that maybe some of these wealthy liberal billionaires may have taken the opportunity today to sell stocks and take some profits just to push the market lower today for Trump’s State of the Union speech?  I wouldn’t put it past these hateful ppl!
336 2018-01-30 21:39:08 It could be. Must be something to it if  the healthcare company stocks are plunging.
337 2018-01-30 21:39:00 30Jan18 / #365APoem / A reminder, so stocks can be falling,
338 2018-01-30 21:38:15 Stocks dropping today.

346 2018-01-30 21:36:07 While stocks are down it's a good time for people to invest because with the economy getting better the stocks will go back up God bless Donald Trump

351 2018-01-30 21:32:24 My guess is they won't be. The market a lot of value today across all indices. It will take a while for a bounce back. Plus, Amazon's 4Q earnings are expected Thursday, which may weigh heavily against the down-trending healthcare stocks.
352 2018-01-30 21:32:20 Yes, this is a risky proposition. The pension funds would not put all the bond money in "the stock market." They would likely invest it the same way they invest their current holdings; stocks, bonds, real, estate, private equity, etc. Likely less than 40% in stocks.
353 2018-01-30 21:31:33 Yield on bonds increased...people are taking money out of stocks putting into bonds

STFU !! if i was just holding BTC ryt now id be almost at a loss
359 2018-01-30 21:30:32 i think we can see more selling. $ms can easily do 54.6. remember at 54.6 it is still only like 3 bucks from all time high. imho, many stocks has peaked for the year.
360 2018-01-30 21:30:26 The market overeacts and the penny stocks will follow as the big boys fall. Hence what happened today
361 2018-01-30 21:30:25 If the market does tank, though, you want to pour every disposable dollar you have into buying those discount stocks. Either the market will recover in force, or you'll be spending bottlecaps and trading radroach meat for bullets and women.

366 2018-01-30 21:28:51 If you think stocks had a rubbish day, take a look a the Cryptos.

#BTC #DAX #Crypto
367 2018-01-30 21:28:51 It's axiomatic that when stocks go down, bonds and commodities go up.
Don't go muni bonds, though, they've been trash since 2008. Commodities are a good medium-term hedge, but you can lose your ass doing short-term.
368 2018-01-30 21:28:49 If they didn’t want ‘em yesterday, they hated ‘em today. Down 400 intra day, the S&P 31, the Nasdaq 62. The 10 yr closed at 2.72 and was deemed a culprit. Oil stocks and health care also took it on the chin.
369 2018-01-30 21:28:31 I’ll stick with trading my stocks crypto isn’t my type lol
370 2018-01-30 21:28:21 Stocks drop the most since August, Dow loses 362 points. High dollar democrat's profit taking just before the state of the union address, in hopes of making Trump look bad........
371 2018-01-30 21:28:16 @jimcramer Hi Jim. I'm all in on the JAB stocks JPM, AMZN and BRKB. What you think? #FlyEaglesFly
372 2018-01-30 21:28:14 Interesting that on the day of the announced Amazon, JPM and Berkshire partnership to fix healthcare that insurers and PBMs took a hit in the market, but provider stocks fared well. Strong (& Intelligent) Market Theory at work?
373 2018-01-30 21:27:43 Infowars is reporting that they have credible proof that liberals deliberately sold off their stocks today to crash the market. The fix is in
374 2018-01-30 21:27:41 $ALGN This is not a very profitable business. It barely makes money. And once teeth are fixed, you lose the customer!? #stocks #align

377 2018-01-30 21:26:44 Tonight when Trump talks about the stock market that has gone up this year and straight up the last 8 years under Obama, try not to get too excited about our prospects as a country.
40% of stocks are owned by the top 1%
80%  owned by top 10%
52% of American’s don’t own stocks
378 2018-01-30 21:26:40 My retirement plan up 21.8% for 2017! That’s massive WINNING! You invested in any American stocks over there in the UK?
379 2018-01-30 21:25:44 I think today we learned that cryptocurrencies aren't a hedge against the market. It is as overvalued as the US market.

While stocks lost 1.3% today, Bitcoin gave up 7%. Other crypto's even more.

384 2018-01-30 21:24:21 Buying stocks 
385 2018-01-30 21:24:05 Yup they are buying back their stocks and giving a one time " bonus " (taxed at 48% btw ) raising some pays, esp in states they have to bcz min wages going up , and how about the store closures and layoffs ?
386 2018-01-30 21:22:36 Good luck on holding pot stocks now. 1 dollar. Lets be realustic here
387 2018-01-30 21:22:30 @Skadforlife Yes many of these stocks have had huge runs, way past whee they should be. Sell and enjoy the profits.
388 2018-01-30 21:22:06 The majority of the stocks I watch all went down today. That's depressing.
389 2018-01-30 21:21:43 Yeah, let's kill all #HealthInsurance #companies, so people have more reasons to be #employees chained to big #corporations. Meanwhile, I'm gonna buy JPM Chase stocks now it's going to save big on employees' health insurance.

395 2018-01-30 21:20:24 anything is possible. I have a gut instinct about this one. I never go long on stocks but something about this one is different.
396 2018-01-30 21:19:33 He was right about selling all stocks. You see what happened?!
397 2018-01-30 21:19:14 I don’t have much knowledge in stock, I’m curious why you think the majority of the pot stocks have dropped the past few weeks and when you think they may go back up?

403 2018-01-30 21:18:01 Dow ends down 361 points, the second consecutive day of triple-digit declines. A major cause of the drop is due to health #stocks, which fell after Amazon, JPMorgan, and Berkshire Hathaway announced their #healthcare partnership.

405 2018-01-30 21:17:49 Nice bottom call for sure, That's why we share ideas here on this feed for those to share stocks that may be of interest to others and try to make our best educated guesses and opinions > 
406 2018-01-30 21:17:44 I don't think it would effect his base at all. They will stand behind him even if he murdered someone on Wall Street, as he said. Besides, his base of people don't even own stocks or know what a 401K does.
407 2018-01-30 21:17:33 I'm still holding $RKS, which could partially be considered a pot play. Day ended without a recovery - I'll wait to buy on the way up. I think the pot stocks will only move up now on news (otherwise they drift down), and it's a long time until July. Swing trades for me, no longs.

423 2018-01-30 21:14:28 that's based on the vagueness of the announcement, little chance of having an impact in the near-term, and the pattern of MCO stocks reacting initially strongly to breaking health care news before leveling back out.

448 2018-01-30 21:07:59 This slight sell off is absolutely nothing. 

But it is a reminder. 

There is no fundamental bid. No one thinks stocks are cheap. 

Once the real selling begins, it is a LONG way down.
449 2018-01-30 21:07:55 228 people 'like'd this so far.  I don't like Trump any more than you guys do but should we really root for stocks to fall just to spite him?

451 2018-01-30 21:07:48 stocks are declining because Healthcare is a risky profitable business and fund managers are wise to unload because this proposed healthcare partnership is not being well received. @cvpayne

453 2018-01-30 21:07:11 Things are going well. Caution: The growth lower than expected 4th quarter. The tariff impact is unknown. The effect of pulling trade pacts is unknown. Stocks may be too exuberant as they are valued at 33 Trillion in a 19 Trillion economy.  DJI down today 300-400 points.

456 2018-01-30 21:05:47 I bought the dip in stocks at 3:59.  A triple leveraged SPY ETF.  Bit of a gamble.  I just want a +2% open and I'll take profits.
457 2018-01-30 21:05:44 A pullback in stocks has long been overdue. The drop of 360-plus pts in the Dow is just 1.4%. Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 declines even less today.

463 2018-01-30 21:04:27 Down day market-wide. I sold some spec plays, as well as all pot stocks. Would have bought the dip in some plays, but I'm not sure the dip is over yet. WEED is on the edge of cliff - no clear direction yet. I'm currently at 75% cash.

543 2018-01-30 20:41:41 No reason for drug stocks to go down, but if you own drug retailers, drug distributors or PBMs, they have been going down for a while based on the AMZN threat.  I am glad to see that because supply chain has excess profits will little value add, and misaligned incentives.

553 2018-01-30 20:40:27 @AliVelshi One of the major reasons for the stock market performance has little to do with any President. Low interest rates force bond money into stocks where the potential return is greater as is the risk. The value of the dollar is also important.

561 2018-01-30 20:38:34 He's gone, dude. Job creation, MHI, stocks, wages, GDP,  will grow under President Trump to the likes of which Obama had never seen (nor was it his intention) and you'll have to come to terms that Mr. Apology is gone. Tough for your man crush, I know, but move on.

736 2018-01-30 20:07:37 One thing today's sell-off reminds us of: higher long rates=stocks down.  And, of course, a slowing economy/recession (lower rates) will also push stocks down.  That means stocks are a lose-lose proposition at these levels.

740 2018-01-30 20:06:52 thats why there was an immediate £70bn of QE to keep stocks up you old fool
741 2018-01-30 20:06:34 Bond yields are higher today, so that means money is coming out of bonds. Stocks are lower today so that means money is coming out of stocks. Where is the money going?

765 2018-01-30 19:59:51 I agree about the stock market not being a factor of our economic growth, as for regulations they may have played small part, but the extreme bump has been the GOP tax plan. Investors bumping stocks to earn big gains back. The bubble will burst very soon.

788 2018-01-30 19:50:42 Stocks are nervous because bond yields are rising.   Corp tax cuts are going to lead to a stronger-than-expected economy, & that means the Fed is going to have to raise rates by more than expected.  This is a good thing for stocks as interest rates rising for right reasons.
789 2018-01-30 19:50:10 but the people investing in stocks such as investment banks tend to do so in the short term, days, weeks or minutes

791 2018-01-30 19:49:53 My guess is the stock market is due for a correction, lots of people know cryptocurrency is a store of value, so they will move $ out of stocks into crypto. Global crypto marketcap is still pretty low all things considered.

793 2018-01-30 19:49:42 Cant argue with someone smarter than you? I lost money under obama. 2015 hit me the hardest. The only reason for the downfall today is the selling of healthcare stocks due to Amazon teaming up with JP Morgan. It will bounce back. Watch and learn.
794 2018-01-30 19:49:39 Look at today’s stocks. Coincidence?
795 2018-01-30 19:48:49 #Stocks,#Indexes No top signal. Unsurprising since top signals generally complete at a rally high, often within hours of the exact peak. Market is off on a novel obsession, interest rates. Probably nothing is going to happen until FOMC conclusion, 1400 tomorrow.
796 2018-01-30 19:48:43 I believe the party is over in financial markets: stocks heading south, interest rates going up. A toxic combination. #investing #stocks
797 2018-01-30 19:48:26 10% of the population controls 80% of stocks & we're seeing record levels of stock buy backs, artificially pushing up the price of stocks.  Stock buy backs were not allowed until 2008 - if memory serves me?
798 2018-01-30 19:48:24 @realDonaldTrump can we assume that you are also the reason for the big drop in stocks today? Or who would you like to blame for that?
799 2018-01-30 19:47:51 The market sell off today was inevitable.  People need money to buy things, reinvest or pay for their year end taxes.  It’s a normal rebalancing of a long bullish market.  It’s a great opportunity to buy some good stocks.  #MAGA
800 2018-01-30 19:47:31 how tf can you say $wynn is strong in a weak tape when the stocks down close to 20% in 2 trading days and just now bouncing ... of course it’s strong you fucks 
801 2018-01-30 19:46:19 Tune in to @CNBCClosingBell around 3:15 p.m. ET: Michael Baker will be on to discuss healthcare stocks.
802 2018-01-30 19:45:58 Yes it's a correction based on health stocks lagging and fear of rising interest rates but the karma of it happing on the day @realDonaldTrump is giving the #SOTU is priceless...
803 2018-01-30 19:45:40 "So the success base-rate of existing methods is low?"

Absolutely.

But that's because traditional portfolios are profoundly under diversified. I.e. 60/40 global stocks/bonds is >98% equity risk. Exposure to alternative macro factors + alt premia might ^^ probability of success.

807 2018-01-30 19:43:52 Stocks of solid USA & intl  blue chip companies are a far better long term secure play. My advice is to own a bit of everything but you can't say stocks & bonds are a fraud.

829 2018-01-30 19:37:38 Agree completely. The upward movement has been extremely strong with regard to US stocks and indices. With European stocks it was not that smooth over the last 10 years with some nice interruptions (Euro crisis, Brexit etc) providing attractive buying opportunities

837 2018-01-30 19:33:58 We who have been in stocks for a long time know that what goes up invariably comes down. If we get a recession, will Trump take credit?

839 2018-01-30 19:33:28 مساء الخير .. ممكن اسأل كيف يتم توزيع ارباح الاسهم؟ مثلا اعمار؟ هل هي عن طريق شيك ام في المحفظة او .... ؟
840 2018-01-30 19:33:23 A Tea Party activist once told me how protected sanctuaries replenish fish stocks.
During an interview on NPR, left-wing environmentalists shared my frustration at the failure of government policy.
Some of my best discussions have been from unexpected audiences.
841 2018-01-30 19:32:58 Perhaps tRUmp and GOP supporters follow stocks and not any news at all? It is difficult to hold such beliefs with even a modicum of intelligence.
842 2018-01-30 19:31:55 So since it's Berkshire Hathaway and a couple of other publicly-traded companies, will the new healthcare co. be called Berk & Stocks?
843 2018-01-30 19:31:52 One thing I have learned over the last few weeks and even months with these stocks $FRFS $IFXY $DSGT $OMVS ...stay on course, do not let weak hands cloud your judgment ...you will be rewarded in a big way if you don't falter... #PENNYSTOCKS #Blockchain #Golf #AI #cannabis

845 2018-01-30 19:31:40 “Deep State” now attempting to sabotage the US stock market by having their large union pension funds dump all of their stocks.
846 2018-01-30 19:31:24 So...if Trump says that when Stocks go up is because of his awesomeness.......means that when it goes down it is because of him too? Or is someone elses fault?
847 2018-01-30 19:30:41 Agreed. If you can't look at 10-year trends of stocks, unemployment, etc. and see similar results from one pres coming out of a recession and the other ... They just see what they want to believe, not what is actually there.
848 2018-01-30 19:30:22 Tonight is GOP donor orchestrated to continue selling their tax scam to the public. If the tail truly wags the dog at all here... I think metals get smashed and stocks get a boost in the next 18 hours

President Trump should begin his State of the Union by thanking int'l Nazi crim Soros for manipulating stocks yesterday & today.

891 2018-01-30 19:20:28 Got to wonder if Bezos, Buffet and Dimon did this to humble Trump before the State of the Union. They knew full well by manipulating health care stocks (1/5 of market) they could drive down the market. What do they want from him?
892 2018-01-30 19:20:22 As far as raising stocks and doing well for the economy he’s been doin quite alright. I just think from a professional standpoint and foreign relations or even domestic relations he’s a bum. This was more about politicians in general (killary)
893 2018-01-30 19:20:05 Misconception: that smart investing is about picking the right individual stocks (instead of understanding diversification basics). Not surprising since many educational intros to stocks involve buying a favorite familiar stock like Disney vs an index. #FinLit

965 2018-01-30 19:02:33 As long as your positions act normally , you should not get out of a trade that is already a winner. When you have a winner in your hand, you should be patient and not get out because it doesn't move up but only get out when the stock gives you a warning. #stocks #investsmart

968 2018-01-30 19:01:47 Hey @realDonaldTrump , since you've taken no responsibility for anything negative, but seem to take full credit for the economy, who are you planning to blame for the record 400 point drop in stocks since May? Let the #TrumpBlameGame commence.  #stocks

972 2018-01-30 19:01:04 They're in the stocks, a face punch is just unimaginitive. Take a shit and freeze it in a block of your own urine then place it on their head in the morning and let the sun do its work
973 2018-01-30 19:00:57 A crash/recession will happen, but that doesn’t mean you or me is right. It just means we stay invested and buy even more when stocks are at bargain prices. I love index funds and will continue to invest in them, but it is OKAY to buy into individual stocks as well.
974 2018-01-30 19:00:37 anyone saying anything negative about the markert going down has to be a bunch of idiots. Unless your shorting stocks- which I doubt anyone on this page is that smart!

1013 2018-01-30 18:49:15 Nopes. I have a pf that is both concentrated and diversified. Concentrated in term of top allocation, and sector selection, diversified in terms of stock counts. I buy many stocks of a sector as a basket.

1018 2018-01-30 18:47:02 Good question. For me, the stock action ALWAYS comes first. The biggest factor, it I see an ETF in a long, steady decline it means the industry is bad. Most likely, the stock won't come up on my screens. But again, stocks 1st. ETF 2nd.
1019 2018-01-30 18:46:37 Unclear. I think it is more about ability to get liquidity. E.g. stocks, cash, gold, art, land all used as store of value. Can only really pay with one....
1020 2018-01-30 18:46:36 They buy when markets go up, manipulate market and buy when stocks hit bottom...ordinary people just see a loss in their retirements..

1022 2018-01-30 18:45:56 While I know stocks the past 2 days are FINALLY bothered by the rise in interest rates, there's a change in market behavior in that there is no coincident rally in treasuries at all today. I know that sounds circular but u get my point.

1039 2018-01-30 18:40:55 Price to earnings ratios have been out of control.  This run-up has been mostly based on feelings.  A year ago stocks were trading at 20 times earnings, which is rather high.  That number is even higher today.  Market exuberance can be a bad thing.
1040 2018-01-30 18:40:50 It’s also not exactly the same with stocks. They generally split so that even if more are “released” existing investors are not diluted.

If this was not the case I doubt “market cap” would be as popular of a metric.

1056 2018-01-30 18:36:59 yes of course, very possible - i know seals love hunting around wind farms these days, but does that explain Dungeness too? What about climate change forcing herring/sprats further north, squeezing stocks into narrow English Channel, condensing the cormorants hunting them?

If you have money in stocks you better move it now to a safer investment.  Trump will bankrupt this country!!!!

1065 2018-01-30 18:34:29 And I wish I could live rent free. In the real world, stocks of health insurers and prescription benefit managers tanking on the news. Healthcare is delivered on a model over 50 years old. If they come up with something new and better, I’m willing to look.

1092 2018-01-30 18:28:37 I agree that you would rather want stocks to be constantly undervalued than overvalued. But wanting your own holdings to go down in price is a different thing.

1095 2018-01-30 18:26:47 What I never understood: why is it a “selloff” only when stocks prices go down? Like, whether they go up or down there’s a seller and a buyer in the transaction right?

1099 2018-01-30 18:26:00 In these times of financial market uncertainty, it dorsnt do any harm to look at your position and how it would be affected by a stock market crash. Would funds exit futures positions, would farmers hold on to stocks, is your currency exposure covered contd...
1100 2018-01-30 18:25:52 its slightly below to 100dma but has been there before and recovered sharply.depends i guess on if this fall in stocks becomes a decent correction.
1101 2018-01-30 18:25:12 You've got 20 percent corrections in several stocks. Important to realize that corrections are happening, and aggressively, not seen in the index though! That's life pal!

1122 2018-01-30 18:21:12 The vast majority of big business profit goes back into the U.S. economy, goes back to taxpayers. More Americans own stocks than do not, many though retirement savings. Stashing money in tax havens is caused by making money overseas that costs too much in taxes to bring back.

1162 2018-01-30 18:13:19 A typical rule of thumb for myself is to not trade when the market is red. If I see a great buying opportunity in a solid #Stock then I will scale in. But never attempt to catch a falling knife. Better to miss-out on some profits than to lose money.

1167 2018-01-30 18:12:17 DJIA went from 7,000 to 20,000 during BO admin, in part because they helped fix the economy after the housing collapse. Wall St. likes the DJT/GOP tax cuts and deregulation.

1185 2018-01-30 18:07:25 Not really. $XLE holds up better because it is less volatile and is made up of higher quality stocks. It is the vehicle of longer term money. $XOP is a vehicle of shorter term money. What you are seeing right now is profit taking on lesser quality stocks that ran too far.
1186 2018-01-30 18:07:06 Headline: Stocks are plunging!

No luck in ASDA or Tesco - I’ve seen the Quorn vegan chicken and Quorn vegan smoked ham but can’t find anywhere that actually stocks it. Xx
1213 2018-01-30 17:57:38 If you've tributed cash to me, I've been blowing it on stocks and reaping 100% of the rewards. You working your shitty job helps keep those companies valuable and gives you more cash to pump into my portfolio. It's a win-win for both of us.
1214 2018-01-30 17:57:24 it's for stocks
1215 2018-01-30 17:56:56 What have we learned today? Well, bonds, dollar, oil, & stocks all sell in tandem. Higher rates unravels low vol strategy
1216 2018-01-30 17:56:50 Instinet is doing the same thing with $CANN as well.  Software wreaks havoc on every stock it touches.  $SX $IDK another good recent examples too. I have seem them short alot of stocks. Hard to beat an algorythmic software that they probably spend millions (at least) to design.
1217 2018-01-30 17:56:38 I'm looking to do more in the industry. I really want to teach, help run things in theatres or with theatre companies or even become an agent. With the skill set of setting up my own company @actorawareness, running workshops etc, I think I can be a massive help. Can anyone help?
1218 2018-01-30 17:56:31 Trump has a potty mouth, ill give you that, but the economy is booming because of this presidency: jobs created, most women in the cabinet then ever before, welfare usage to it's lowest, stocks up, mortgage rates up. All says one thing, things are doing better
1219 2018-01-30 17:56:24 It has been, check day before yesterday's article I wrote to explain why. It is strictly a measure of the weightings of the components and balance of small cap vs large cap stocks. Basically, what you are seeing is short term spec money vs longer term fund money in those two
1220 2018-01-30 17:56:23 $ACGX the market has yet to realize the Net income gains in the year of 2017, and the positive PE ratio that should accompany stocks with positive Earnings (Net Income). Should be at .008+ easily. EPS could be as high as .0004-.0006, and a PE ration of 25 puts us at .01+
1221 2018-01-30 17:55:28 Who knows when stocks top but hard time believing #s&p500 doesn’t hit 3000.  Markets usually hit round numbers when fairly close.  Pullbacks happen, markets aren’t supposed to move in straight lines. #stocks

1226 2018-01-30 17:53:56 UK fishermen are deluded if they think Brexit will help their cause. Also, it will allow further ravaging of the seas and less control over EU cartels. Hard science will be the saviour of our fish stocks. Not UK fishermen. A socialist government would buy them out.
1227 2018-01-30 17:52:30 Everybody better sell their stocks now, because if Trump fire's Mueller, the Stock Market will go straight down.  Already down more than 300 points!
1228 2018-01-30 17:52:20 Well that truly was a pants day!! Gain of 1.4% from yesterday has been all but wiped out. I have been selling down over the past few days & am now down to 30 stocks & 33% cash. Just feeling a little twitchy!

1237 2018-01-30 17:49:31 It is a poor indicator of economy. Most don’t follow stocks less than 50% including retirements have any investments in stock.
1238 2018-01-30 17:48:57 If you’re putting money into your 401k and  buying stocks, you want low stock prices.  You only want high stock prices when you retire and sell.  So no, not good for 30-60 year olds.

1243 2018-01-30 17:46:50 As a regular guy who buys stocks on the 15th and 30th of each month no matter what, this is actually fine. They could stand to get a good bit cheaper. And if Trump takes it in the teeth, even better.

1260 2018-01-30 17:42:34 Really? 40 million Americans retirement account rely entirely on the stick market. Ask them if it's part of their economy. You know nothing about business obviously. Higher stocks mean higher dividends, more money for companies to create jobs etc. Get educated.

1264 2018-01-30 17:40:21 [stocks drop once]

"this is a coup"
1265 2018-01-30 17:40:06 Gold stocks barely got a sugar high from the 1 year + 4 month rally from $1100 to $1900. Then onto the 6-7 year long depression that we are still in.
1266 2018-01-30 17:40:05 300 points is nothing. The markets are primed for a major correction. The VLMAP is very low. All up cycles end eventually. Anyone with more than 50% in stocks is taking too much risk.
1267 2018-01-30 17:39:51 So amazon is now turning to health care now? Couldn’t have been a better time to be on that wave. Them stocks about to blow up again lol

1273 2018-01-30 17:38:06 I read some Elliot wave pros.  They stupid bearish BTC/LTC.   They usually good in stocks - mostly catch the big moves. Not enuff data yet for crypto.  But they know EWT real good.  I’m cautious.  but I’m in a position of strength Bc made moves months ago.  NEO/ETH I’m bullish.

1277 2018-01-30 17:35:43 Yet it isn’t frowned upon, it’s encouraged.  You spend all your paycheck on scratch-its? Gross.  You invested your money in stocks! That’s smart.  Nobody says they invest in the lottery. Nobody says wasted their money on stocks.
1278 2018-01-30 17:34:46 Yes, this is working but it will only work for so long, stocks will build speculators will get nervous and pull their money

1313 2018-01-30 17:23:55 Sir, any specific reason behind shorting Shriram, Havells and Just Dial? Want to understand logic behind arriving at these shorting stocks.
1314 2018-01-30 17:23:54 Robinhood currently does this for stocks, but it'd be hard to see an established (read, old) broker doing this as it would upset shareholders true.
1315 2018-01-30 17:23:44 Lots of speculation on how BTC would react to an equity market crash (say 20%). Pure guess: I think it would trade in-line with stocks in a fast crash/one or two day scenario, but then rebound faster, higher and more durably as non-correlation reasserts itself.
1316 2018-01-30 17:23:40 Exactly they are looking at their Stocks zooming up that's all that's going on. Unemployment rates are going to go up because Stores are closing everywhere.

1339 2018-01-30 17:16:21 Hopefully if retiring next week they are all in stocks
1340 2018-01-30 17:15:55 #Biotech stocks dragged the stock market lower on Tuesday after Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon unveiled a plan to get into the health insurance business.
1341 2018-01-30 17:15:49 Stocks dropped yesterday I’m pissed
1342 2018-01-30 17:15:48 @ReformedBroker Stocks to watch: $TWTR up almost 4% on buyout rumors
1343 2018-01-30 17:15:42 Am I the only one excited about this market "selloff"?!  Keep in mind triple digit moves down on the #Dow sound scary, but are not that large on a % basis as the index increases.  #stocks
1344 2018-01-30 17:15:42 I carry mostly mining stocks, there are more red days than green days. The green days are just really sweet
1345 2018-01-30 17:15:36 It seems to me he is selling not due to valuation/bargain status but due to portfolio risk and pain threshold. If you are very overweight on some stocks and they move against you at some point the risk is often best managed by decreasing your position.
1346 2018-01-30 17:15:18 OK #Crypto, I’m going to tell you something you don’t want to hear. I’m new at this and at the same time I bought my first crypto currencies, I bought my first stocks.The stocks have given me a better return. Are you getting out of this lousy state or what? #StockMarket #seaofred
1347 2018-01-30 17:14:52 True, #SOTU isn't a huge deal. Previous tweet is venting over general frustration re: lack of consistency among justices on certain institutional policies, like how to check for conflicts, whether to allow press at OOT events, whether to own individual stocks, etc.
1348 2018-01-30 17:14:52 Magezi, I need more than 280 chars to explain but briefly, our indigenous stocks have unparalleled potential to nourish everyone, they're cost effective, well adapted and hardy too. Just underutilized, that's where @ialf16 comes in.
1349 2018-01-30 17:13:59 Can exporting #fish lead to the collapse of fish stocks? Perhaps...but if you deplete the stock you cannot export... Interesting seminar at @UMiamiRSMAS by resource economist from Oxford

1353 2018-01-30 17:12:11 MARKETS correcting as investors take PROFITS which has most stocks trading down. my last sells down 4-5% so buying some back. $IVR pays out dividends. $NFLX seems out of control as it dips then rips. #tradingstocks
1354 2018-01-30 17:12:01 Both ,stocks too born
1355 2018-01-30 17:11:56 Here’s 1 “story” I think maybe happening, so I watch. Stock mkt weak today.  Knee jerk down move in BTC with stocks -then state of union. Soon after, stocks may get hit for 2018 and ppl realize BTC is a safe haven.  Down BTC first, to rip after ppl figure stk bubble over (maybe)

1363 2018-01-30 17:09:15 Stocks falling drastically just before SOTU Address. Trump will have to scramble to have his staff rewrite his speech now that his brilliancy has dropping numbers.
1364 2018-01-30 17:08:29 Yah what Gold does Switzerland own now-all replaced by US stocks?  LOL.
1365 2018-01-30 17:08:29 Gold, oil, bonds and stocks all down ..great example of how cross asset relationships can do the unexpected. BTC is also getting smoked, but I don’t consider crypto to be an asset class. Lots of noise today..strong earnings and a steeper yield curve should be the focus.

1369 2018-01-30 17:07:02 As per Prof. Shiller (Economics Nobel prize) in NYT (Business), present price of stocks is way above the value implicit in reported earnings and a sharp down correction (bubble burst) is to be expected in the not so long future.

1376 2018-01-30 17:05:31 I'm a flipper on specific stocks, but this one I'm playing long and loading up on all panic dips.
1377 2018-01-30 17:05:18 It’s basically investment / stock broker but you can buy diversified stocks ( like a stock that reflects the entire market and not one company) so that your interest rate rises with the stock market instead of stagnating in bank account
1378 2018-01-30 17:05:18 Tryna buy some stocks for the future 
1379 2018-01-30 17:05:12 The most humbling experience you'll get is from the losses you rack up, not the wins you make from investing or trading stocks.

1392 2018-01-30 17:02:38 Yup. With how Trump fixed the economy and everyone getting great jobs and awesome tax breaks and cashing in the stocks they all own after he made the market soar you'd think any Trump supporter who wanted a Harley could afford one now.

1401 2018-01-30 17:00:17 Trust me. Trump will blame Hillary and Obama for stock market drop. He’s not accountable to his wife, his staff, his party, or obviously his country.

1409 2018-01-30 16:57:17 Yes. Drop into a local store that stocks them for a demo.
1410 2018-01-30 16:57:05 CNBC's "Fast Money" is no different than the inept youtubers that post "Top 5 coins to make you rich!" I watched their normal stocks analyses for the first time and they are just as stupid as they are with crypto. Amazing really. Success cannot be spoon-fed. Feed yourself.
1411 2018-01-30 16:56:28 Stocks down again today Donnie. Do you know why? Because people know we have an incompetent and impotent President!
1412 2018-01-30 16:56:23 Compared to $300,000 for the 1%, who earns it by manipulating stocks, $1,000 seems just a bit low 
1413 2018-01-30 16:56:01 Still haven't figured out how companies like $MCD & $PFE can deliver solid earnings and still lose ground?....... Maybe just do everything the opposite way around. Bow wow stocks with terrible earnings are the NEW buy

1427 2018-01-30 16:54:36 The economy is not "booming".  Stocks rise and fall without any actual effect on the populace, and always have.  The majority will never see any benefit besides a few hundred dollars, but people will suffer when entitlement programs are cut to pay for the tax bill.
1428 2018-01-30 16:54:22 Prices are adjusting to their fair valuations but should trade at rich valuations as growth seems impeccable, as these stocks have run up so much some correction is great for the stocks for further upmove, will start moving higher as value can be seen after descent correction.

1439 2018-01-30 16:50:43 From the look of the for-profit health insurance stocks today; I’d say the Amazon Berkshire JPM announcement rocked their world. Those preserving the status quo will get run over by the disrupters. Today is one of those days.
1440 2018-01-30 16:49:11  The economy is being driven by business and job growth. More full time jobs are being created. Unlike you guys counting part time jobs as created jobs. Lowest gdp in 8 yrs stocks being over valued. 0% interest rate. Out of control printing of fiat. List goes on.
1441 2018-01-30 16:49:06 I'm very positive on PCBL. Maybe not in the same league as GI and HEG but it's going to post some very good numbers. When this selling stops, these stocks would be the first of the block.

1468 2018-01-30 16:39:02 Yes thats how its measured... all the volume today that pours into stocks up from pClose vs down from pClose— for a net + or - total volume DIFFERENCE.  So clearly today volume predominatly going into stocks below pClose. Why isnt this having a bearish sustained impact on price?
1469 2018-01-30 16:38:21 The Tillerson Effect:  Exxon stocks are overvalued. The company’s free cash flow is pitifully insufficient to cover debts. Haha

1472 2018-01-30 16:38:14 I have no idea what the next 80 cents is on any trade. I want to have a thesis for the next $8 or $80 on the stocks over $100
1473 2018-01-30 16:38:07 Hickey is a hack when it comes to gold/mining stocks. Here's the funny part, Fleckenstein gets his opinion on the pm sector from Hickey.  Fleck is another asshole who sneers at the idea that gold is manipulated
1474 2018-01-30 16:38:06 Oh lord... The EU's fishing policy is to protect fish stocks NOT to piss off Britain. The laws are there to ensure you can still eat cod in 50 years because if we carried on the way were were some species would be extinct. You can find this out by doing a search on the net mate.

bitcoin et. al are not stocks - what is interesting is whether they decide to start legally classifying them as stocks and hence regulate them that way? It is the biggest risk

1487 2018-01-30 16:34:41 Sell off in stocks the last two days. Apple news as well as bond worries hitting the market. Looks like a good buying opportunity if it finds some support.

Hopefully this weekend. Anyone who plans to ‘Earn up in 2018’ should definitely consider stocks.
1492 2018-01-30 16:33:05 Stocks that lagged behind or did not perform as well as others, generally could catch up in February. And those did great, expect continue up..
1493 2018-01-30 16:32:47 Hah, or how analysts push stocks they already have positions in. All too often, I can name the stocks an analyst is going to talk up or down before they start talking. Knowing that is important.

1499 2018-01-30 16:30:19 Don’t underestimate the power of passive income, you know those forms of income that bring in cash passively? Truly they matter. Stocks is one major one!! After I saw my hubby ramp up 12k from One Stock I told myself 2018—-> We move into stocks!!

1532 2018-01-30 16:20:00 Bumpfire stocks make your weapon extremely inaccurate. No one cared about them at all til the left started trying to ban them. Most of us have no desire for one, but we can’t give an inch to gun control, lest you want 2 inches next time.

1545 2018-01-30 16:17:43 Let me put it to you this way, if these companies have say, 20,000 employees and they each get 1000$ that's 20,000,000 $ they have made billions more than that in the stock market and are buying back company stocks thus getting richer so don't tell me their being generous wakeup
1546 2018-01-30 16:17:40 You are correct but again. I'm not defending them. I'm explaining their mentality. Just like banning bump stocks, it's a fairly logical idea (not saying I agree) but it's that whole slippery slope argument.

1552 2018-01-30 16:16:09 You don't want real discussion. You stick to your discrete issue like bump stocks- pros & cons which isn't an issue anymore. If you want real information, educate yourself instead of idly wondering why people are dying in our streets & what possible reason the NRA gets blamed.

The Pound, London stocks and other UK assets largely ignored a pessimistic analysis claiming the UK will be worse off after Brexit, suggesting Brexit is no longer a major market mover...
1603 2018-01-30 16:02:32 Stocks are down as yields continue to rise across the world. Higher PE. Bigger fall. Don’t worry this is all part of the normalization process. The easy money has been made in stocks now.

1660 2018-01-30 15:46:40 That's rubbish. Where do you get your information from? Do a Google search - you will see it's wrong. You are basing your entire argument on the fact you think something but haven't actually checked. The EU protects fish stocks, that's why we have sustainable lists.

1668 2018-01-30 15:44:54 Also a function of more factors. With earnings, it’s just earnings. With price, it’s earnings + absolute multiple of stocks + relative multiple of stock A vs B + opportunity of US vs non-US, etc... a reason long bonds have fixed coupons, yet price is as volatile as stocks.
1669 2018-01-30 15:44:45 $NTLA also bouncing .. added low 25s

1810 2018-01-30 15:27:11 Stocks and interest rates have been rising together in recent weeks, an unusual development as higher rates typically dent demand for riskier assets like stocks.

1813 2018-01-30 15:26:54 What I did. Use floating rate too. Everyone getting concerned by higher yields. I expect yields to dump again once stocks fall meaningfully. See my pinned tweet. Then QE infinity plus NIRP next - get the banks to pay you to borrow and spend. They've no other choice.
1814 2018-01-30 15:26:52 They don't know what to invest in. Take that 50k and invest in starting your own business. Buy stocks that pay dividends. Invest in something that creates residual income. Not you homeboys mix tape, bitcoin or any other fad.

1889 2018-01-30 15:08:01 Just a slight correction, and Amazon is teaming with 2 other companies to work on a way to lower healthcare costs, which is hitting healthcare and pharm companies.  Similar to how the grocery stocks took a hit when Amazon bought Fresh Market. Great time to buy the dip.

1904 2018-01-30 15:05:11 Stocks are down today because interest rates are rising because the economy is amazing and that's how it works.
1905 2018-01-30 15:04:47 Yet another great opportunity to get comfortably long stocks.
1906 2018-01-30 15:04:44 It's what makes economics so dismal. Trump wants us to think the economy is booming as evidenced by the stock market. But if it is, interest rates will go up hurting stocks. Can Trump accept that?
1907 2018-01-30 15:04:14 The market has tanked the last two days and the financial media has all the wrong reasons for the tank.

The market is down due to the release of the FISA memo.   Why because uncertainty is bad for stocks & there are some major uncertainties about the effect of the FISA memo

1914 2018-01-30 15:02:53 I think it’s reckless to own the DOW as well.  But this time of year (post Christmas) is almost always tough on the markets.  Q4 is over and Q1 (usually rough) is starting.  Plus earnings, adjusting to new laws eff Jan 1, etc.  

TL;DR - Jan/Feb frequently suck for stocks.

1958 2018-01-30 14:53:03 If you bought at the top in 1929 & held on till1960, returns would have been 7.8%/year.

And, if you had bought in June 1932 after 85% drop in stocks & held till 1960, returns would have been 15.9%/year.

In both cases, long-term approach gave +ve returns.

2043 2018-01-30 14:34:09 Might be a rough day in stocks. Just after the open Dow down roughly 220 points, with Nasdaq down about 60.
2044 2018-01-30 14:33:38 UNH alone equals a decline of 115 Dow points.  Live by the high priced stocks...

What a precious combination
2048 2018-01-30 14:32:06 Let’s see.  Folks are getting bonuses, raises, a bump in paychecks, and stocks/401k doing well.  Yeah, it’s pretty ridiculous

2051 2018-01-30 14:31:36 #TuesdayThoughts Stocks are rising . Do you =
2052 2018-01-30 14:31:05 We are now in a classic Keynes beauty contest market. Most professional investors know stocks are overvalued, but they think crowd dynamics will keep prices rising.
2053 2018-01-30 14:30:57 WHOA! Stocks can down?!?! 
I didn't sign up for this!
2054 2018-01-30 14:30:55 $SPY this is the day I been waiting for. $ATVI $ILMN $NVDA $AAPL $GOOGL $IWM  on watch. Stay away from junk; play only blue blood stocks.
2055 2018-01-30 14:30:49 Exactly. They are cult stocks. The ones you usually lose the most on
2056 2018-01-30 14:30:33 I think it’s also interesting that some big cap stocks like NFLX and BABA kicked off their runs in this uptrend from a sizable consolidation and big volume days and have almost doubled.. NFLX around 150-160 to 285 and BABA around 120 to 200.. AMZN from 700 to 1400..
2057 2018-01-30 14:30:26 Seems like a reversal on cards. A pull back from 50% fibo has been seen repeatedly over the past 12 months in many stocks - can replicate here too. Also, HnS also has a 50-50 chance of failing !

2060 2018-01-30 14:29:05 wall street trouncing stocks again today for no real reason, fridays gains wiped out, complete scam on investors and everyone's IRAs. I'm sure they are profiting today but no one else. They are creating volatility to their benefit only, disgusting

2068 2018-01-30 14:25:47 You can control something that is illiquid. Try owning private stocks. You control them. You have both the legal and equitable interest in them. Good luck selling them though (depending on the company) - you may even sell them at a discount to NAV!
2069 2018-01-30 14:25:02 Looks like the #market will gap down this morning. I don't know if i will be trading today. This is the biggest gap down since I started trading. Since 3/4 of all stocks follow the spy.. probably sitting on my hands. Don't want to lose money on my birthday lol GL ALL

2075 2018-01-30 14:23:07 i mean gold fluctuates with supply and demand, but i think the biggest driving factor in gold price isn't people scared of the stocks. it's just that it takes more dollars to buy the same amount of gold. weaker dollar = more dollars to buy the same gold bar = inverse relations
2076 2018-01-30 14:22:07 friday's day-end euphoria combined with yesterday's weak close has topping patterns all over the place, and yet i can't get conviction about establishing short positions in anything. #stocks
2077 2018-01-30 14:21:46 Healthcare stocks down amid talks of collaboration between AMZN, BRKB & JPM on ways to offer healthcare to US employees at lower costs.

2081 2018-01-30 14:20:56 after @POTUS first #SOTU last year stocks rallied on notion that trump can act like a normal president some traders looking for similar rally after tonights speech my worry: tax cuts werent priced into stocks last year seems like they are now

2083 2018-01-30 14:20:16 One of the first stocks I ever bought. Saying cannabis back then was like saying blockchain 2 months ago.
2084 2018-01-30 14:19:20 Stocks fall as sell off contours with market pulling back from record levels.
2085 2018-01-30 14:18:35 Investors are buying more stocks at reasonable prices before they explode again.
2086 2018-01-30 14:18:08 Profiteers are always ecstatic at news of possible war, buying the stocks of military contractors hand over fist at the smallest hint of war
2087 2018-01-30 14:17:12 Happens all the time. People talking about bitcoin being this and that when their fiat world and stocks it's way worst.
2088 2018-01-30 14:17:03 No bump stocks either
2089 2018-01-30 14:16:54 Kenya is a Comic Book, 

I wonder if BookStop stocks it...
2090 2018-01-30 14:15:19 Like how Ppl stopped talking abt crypto after d fall, same is happening with mid n small cap stocks. Ppl hav stopped discussing it in Mumbai locals.. When Everybdy panics, that's when the rally begins usually. Hold on to yo high conviction names that r growing well n still fallin
2091 2018-01-30 14:15:18 $QQQ $AAPL $SPY IF guidance is very poor, Apple can easily trade down to the $140 level seen at iPhone X launch. #stocks #apple
2092 2018-01-30 14:14:56 Market is and let alone the quality of the institutions' loan book that would result in such a massive valuation and growth momentum that Capitec experienced.

2095 2018-01-30 14:14:08 $QQQ $SPY $AAPL No question about IF Apple misses, the question is how bad guidance is. If bad, market will trade down 10% or more. #stocks
2096 2018-01-30 14:14:06 I’d suggest buying some healthcare stocks after this bogus news from Amazon. I don’t see how a partnership with 2 other companies lowers costs. And isn’t it just for employees of these 3 companies??

2100 2018-01-30 14:12:42 If you believe Paddock shot all those people using bump stocks you need to take viagra eyedrops & have a long hard look at the evidence
2101 2018-01-30 14:12:42 What market? There is nothing that gives xrp value. They are not stocks. I see, unfortunately, no reason why they should go up. If I am missing something, which is not unlikely, please educate me.
2102 2018-01-30 14:12:31 Larger numbers in Sandwich & Pegwell Bay for last 2-3 years. Our theory - New wind farm and associated fishing exclusion zone increasing local fish stocks
2103 2018-01-30 14:12:06 One of the smartest investors I know actually "chases stocks" as part of his strategy. There are scenarios where it makes sense.

2141 2018-01-30 14:00:38 My experience: when $VIX up 40% or more in less than a week it’s a RAGING LONG OPPORTUNITY IN STOCKS if only for a short term trade. Watch $VIX $VXV line today. It  will flush over 1 today= buy signal. $CPCE >1 would be ideal as well
2142 2018-01-30 14:00:32 funny that they are killing the healthcare stocks today...the joint venture has to build the venture from the ground up...we know how hard a problem healthcare is to solve...could be great buying opp   watching unh      they make so much money and will just buyback a shit ton
2143 2018-01-30 14:00:15 Who's going to want to own dollars if Us stocks don't even go up every day?
2144 2018-01-30 13:59:48 Bonds maybe. Stocks not so much & still less real world resources - of which US land represents two thirds of $ value in existence. Equity release of land value is impossible without income/purchasing power

2154 2018-01-30 13:55:35 The stocks of current insurers fell about 6%, which seems pretty reasonable to me. Extra competition, possible predatory pricing for market share, possible political connections, name recognition of Amazon, etc etc.
2155 2018-01-30 13:55:20 So let me see y'all are going to trust an company that makes money shorting stocks of people they release reports on, a company that has 3 people, based in US, uses Gmail for corporate email and runs a crappy WordPress website? Really? Good luck to you then
2156 2018-01-30 13:55:19 Really? But the president says stocks only go up.
2157 2018-01-30 13:55:03 Very illustrative quote, @RyanDetrick!

2172 2018-01-30 13:47:02 GROWING stocks is not a threat, it is NORMAL response to mandatory turn-around at refineries producing gasoline, for the US mkt.

2173 2018-01-30 13:46:14 Wrong. It doesn't take a genius to see that swamping the country with too many immigrants at a time will overwhelm our housing stocks and services. Of course that hasn't happened has it?

2185 2018-01-30 13:40:19 In a strengthening economy, one where confidence is rising, one would expect that investors would take money out of bonds and be more willing to take on the risk of stocks, because of the greater rewards. Is this not happening?
2186 2018-01-30 13:40:05 A return to normal levels of equity market volatility will be surprising to some after a long period of relative calm. Don’t panic - it’s why you are compensated for owning stocks.

2311 2018-01-30 12:42:41 We were talking about the medical industry now you jump to the 'evil of profits'.  The alternative to capitalism has been tried and failed miserably.  Roughly 50% of Americans own stocks, including me.

2313 2018-01-30 12:41:41 This Amazon healthcare thing seems a lot like the Costco freakout. This is a very long term investment and if it doesn't effect next quarter everyone will forget about it. Only issue is that stocks have risen so much that one whack doesn't make them cheap

2334 2018-01-30 12:30:41 What is worth more, a dollar invested in stocks or a dollar invested in bonds?  Real answer: they are both worth a dollar.  GASB answer: a dollar in stocks is worth more because we forget to risk-adjust the expected returns on pension assets.  Therein lies the flaw.

You buy as cheap as you can ,sell high .Hold the good ones in a bull
2345 2018-01-30 12:27:47 It’s nothing against Capitec as a Bank. The Viceroy tossers are short sellers, they make their profit when stocks fall. They probably realized their profits when Capitec’s share price fell. They should be prosecuted for market manipulation.

2391 2018-01-30 11:53:13 By the time it comes out that the Viceroy report is a sham, stocks will be on a steady rise again. Also, many people with Capitec have no knowledge of the contents of the report and after the dust has settled, their clients will remain.

2645 2018-01-30 08:18:26 Ya, no. Viceroy is shorting these stocks for all they're worth. 

But Capitec definitely needs to address their lending practices. They're tantamount to exploitation (but all banks are tbh.)
2646 2018-01-30 08:17:25 They can't admit they're wrong in supporting this President. I guess it's Bank accounts and stocks over integrity and honesty.
2647 2018-01-30 08:16:32 My focus here was on the management fee and particularly at Zimele. Who can deny that investing directly in govt bonds or Safcom stocks wouldn't yield better than this?

2700 2018-01-30 07:36:44 Please read your business journals and research.  Some companies are laying off because of the tax reductions and made it clear that savings would be used to buy back stocks and raise dividends. One of the reasons the stock market is so hot. Companies are investing in themselves.

Le solde extérieur contribue positivement à la croissance du PIB: +0,6 point (vs -0,5 à T3).

Contribu° varia° stocks:-0,5
2702 2018-01-30 07:34:39 It’s gonna get a lot worse If the Dow comes off 5-7%. Seen it many times before. Stocks that have already fallen 30% can fall another 30%.
2703 2018-01-30 07:34:12 it’s simple, reduce exposure to oz economy and especially financial stocks, increase cash/bond holdings. Own some foreign ETFs. But it’s hard to  wait it till that happens. Not saying own zero Oz stocks.

2772 2018-01-30 06:32:20 A LOT! but it's not too late, even with a small collection of alts. If after 9 years, you're waiting on the sidelines b/c "it's complicated", "I'll wait until the next crash" or "it's a bubble"; take time to examine all your investments: ALL stocks you own started as just an idea
2773 2018-01-30 06:31:32 It took 10Y TSY yields to 2.70% (last seen in Apr 2014, WSJ) and talks (and possible front-running) of huge month-end selling rebalancing for US stocks to finally see S&P losing 0.7%.

2781 2018-01-30 06:24:14 The real "rip off" to the pubic/GIFT to the rich is the "stepped up basis" of inherited stocks. There can be a lifetime of capital gains that NOBODY EVER pays tax on for securities inherited. But, EVERY $ you actually work for is looked at for tax.
2782 2018-01-30 06:23:44 PKG got filled Friday, but the thrust higher could not be sustained. Should have gotten out near days market  close, but I was lax, and did not watch the close. But, got out the very next opportunity Monday opening range @ 128.76 . #stocks #trading #market #investment
2783 2018-01-30 06:23:40 Definition of 'Stocks'

Definition: A stock is a general term used to describe the ownership certificates of any company. A share, on the other hand, refers to the stock certificate of a particular company. Holding a particular company's share makes you a shareholder.

2792 2018-01-30 06:14:12 Issue with stocks are normal janta tend to enter when it's almost time to exit, history hv shown they repeatedly burnt fingers. Yes agree that discipline alone can help them win.

2799 2018-01-30 06:07:52 1 And really the fact that politicians are making millions deciding which companies get which billion dollar contract to build weapons so they buy stocks in those companies ahead of time and when the stock rise jumps up they get rich.

2884 2018-01-30 05:08:15 Thank you, Carlos. Dropped my heavy $ETC and $ZEC bags before they crashed. Traded it all in for Bitconnect $BCC., which is due for a BIG bounce. Also going long on Blockbuster Video and Circuit City stocks. See the rest of you suckers on Jupiter (that's like way past the moon).
2885 2018-01-30 05:07:00 Just observed ... since Jan 04 #Nifty #Sensex haven't closed below 50EMA in 30 minutes chart.

And, what does it mean?
Bulls have immense control on Index & Index Stocks.
2886 2018-01-30 05:05:54 Sir,  no impact will b there to Indian Stock markets. Since, all money is pumped into Nifty 50 stocks, how can it fall!!
2887 2018-01-30 05:05:50 All reading , gyan gets tested in such times , one who has strong will, heart, foresight and own conviction in stocks prevail i guess, i am learning too 
2888 2018-01-30 05:03:08 Buy Valve stocks
2889 2018-01-30 05:02:59 Exactly all these other stocks have risen dramatically on block chain rumour only. $GTG has the goods and legit #blockchain interest and soon management so #multibags here we come enjoy the ride
2890 2018-01-30 05:02:29 Not all stocks are at record highs. Many losing ground. Fossil fuel and mining companies are leading the stock market, but responsible investors have already divested of these stocks.
2891 2018-01-30 05:02:26 Methinks the steep spiral of the Indian stock markets  is a symptom of too much money chasing too few stocks. We are  short of low premium early stage IPO’s?
How to boost the primary market - something for policy makers to think about. #markets #stocks #IPO #BudgetSession2018
2892 2018-01-30 05:01:07 In The Market IV: Pls see a daily chart of #sp500 that also shows the 200-day moving average (MA). On Friday close, the S&P 500 stood a lofty 14% above this long-term support/resistance line. Highest since at least Jan 2017. A pullback would not be abnormal #stocks #nasdaq #djia

2898 2018-01-30 04:56:14 Already many guru oriented/backed stocks fell by 25-30% ....Many short term traders will become Loooong term investors. CNBC already used the term "butchered" at the start of a fall...dont know what term would be used if the small cap/midcap index falls by 10%. Cash Is King!!
2899 2018-01-30 04:53:27 Stocks Under $10 will be adding tomorrow in the afternoon -- around 1:00 to 1:30 CST

2905 2018-01-30 04:48:28 Funny how u talk about that, lets talk about bigshit’s stocks not going up after ~selling~ 1M albums.
2906 2018-01-30 04:47:43 @jimcramer I hear you are coming to visit me in Minneapolis this week for the Super Bowl?  Go Eagles!  What do you think about  setting a trailing stop to limit losses and protect gains on the stocks that one owns?  I know you’re not a fan of automated market orders. #MadTweets
2907 2018-01-30 04:47:35 I’m up on ACB ~44% and weed ~15% Bleeding away the profits into other less volatile stocks. Trying to get to that point where playin with house money. Might not get there
2908 2018-01-30 04:45:33 All small cap traders are in hiding now with their penny stocks.....
2909 2018-01-30 04:45:30 Oh yeah, they're already telling everyone so. What they don't realize is, that certain mega cap stocks are lining up for earnings & the market was too stretched. Now, there's room for some rotation.
2910 2018-01-30 04:45:12 @sarbanandsonwal @narendramodi @arunjaitley Sir pls ask officials to check Transporters. They are the carrier of black stocks for business.

2914 2018-01-30 04:42:33 Why is Jim Cramer allowed to cause the pumping and selling of stocks?

2921 2018-01-30 04:38:02 Right I dabble in trading but I prefer crypto currency and ICO's. For in when Bitcoin was $700. I've seen companies such as Home Depot who are fun to buyback stock also offer stocks to employees so it's a win win right!

2964 2018-01-30 04:13:00 Excessive leverage is always a greater risk to markets than excessive valuations. And when both are excessive at the same time, markets are at greatest risk.

Side note: If someone uses their safety money, 2 try n make a quick buck in stocks, that is also a form of leverage

2976 2018-01-30 04:03:03 weird it correlates that much. Noting of course, the bottom 90% isn't doing much saving as a % of income. Really says something that the richest people are stashing away so much wealth. Wonder if this graph considers investments (stocks, etc.) "saving"
2977 2018-01-30 04:02:38 Do you have a job or are you ignorant , if so look at you're 401k and stocks
2978 2018-01-30 04:02:33 Inventory is easily accounted for today. If a retailer stocks the shelf with 50 products and they aren’t rung up at the register someone walked out without paying for them. This isn’t rocket science. Do you think black people should get hair products free because of slavery?

2980 2018-01-30 04:00:36 Pro money is quietly cautious it seems, embarassed about Trump while others use his dumb optimistic populism to push stocks higher on assumption of deregulation will mean new jobs, higher pay, etc. Ludicrous stock pumping for bonuses is what it feels like.

2985 2018-01-30 03:54:56 Why wouldn't Leprechauns put their gold into stocks and bonds and get a higher rate of return?
2986 2018-01-30 03:54:21 BUBBLE!  I still trade stocks. “Stock market in longest period ever without a 5% pullback, all way back to 1929”. Lots of other metrics stretched - so bearish.  We should know this year how correlated crypto is to stocks.  I think LOTTA ppl gonna find out it’s a safe haven.
2987 2018-01-30 03:52:56 EMAMI tanks 5% note that volumes this quarter have been limited to 6% whereas expectation was of at least 12% volume Growth. 
Market is not willing to overlook a  single negative factor in Midcaps stocks that anyway have run ahead of themselves.
2988 2018-01-30 03:52:18 Set a day sometime before tournament, on that day have a netplay session, limited period of time, and see who can take two or three stocks first or something

Or any type of exhibition thing. Like bob omb melee, coin melee, teams also if you want to do that
2989 2018-01-30 03:51:56 I see, your points are quite clear. But do you need a decent capital in order to invest in stocks tho?
2990 2018-01-30 03:51:53 For those who say Ignorance is bliss, they haven’t held Mutual Funds through a correction. Not knowing which stocks you own doesn’t make u any less vulnerable to market volatility. Mutual Funds are not the silver bullet to short term gains. They are instruments to invest.

3003 2018-01-30 03:44:44 Yeah. All that legislation he signed and all those jobs they waited until 2018 to drop to buy back stocks to look profitable and so when you add those jobs you just lost, but not in that sector, it looks like you're adding more jobs but you're not. Because optics.
3004 2018-01-30 03:44:36 Would not be surprised to see stocks plunge on Tuesday. Not a full-blown 1987 moment, but something to really test the conviction of the bulls.  $spy $spx $dia $djia $es

3045 2018-01-30 03:24:39 Obviously you have no understanding of what it means for oil companies to invest.  They are not buying stocks.  They are buying leases on property or offshore leases - oh money to the government to drill.  That creates jobs jobs jobs.
3046 2018-01-30 03:24:38 3. As soon as these factors cross each other and stocks rise market will correct itself but shale producers will demand cost parity.

3050 2018-01-30 03:22:33 He President does not and should not matter. 80% of stocks in the US are owned by the top 10% of Americans. This means that the market does not give an accurate representation of the overall state of the economy.

3127 2018-01-30 02:44:53 Imo its a lot about the sector. Once the pullback slows down, $LG and other micro pot stocks should climb up with appropriate NRs. Sit tight and load up!
3128 2018-01-30 02:44:41 I hope it isn't as bad as that. Surely the military will keep its end of the deal up. The economy in the US is doing very well, at least according to my paltry few US equities stocks. So it isn't all doom and gloom. Do you ever wonder if the real power isn't in politics anyway?

3146 2018-01-30 02:36:18 Everyone is offended by everything these days.  But hey, let’s keep selling those bump stocks.
3147 2018-01-30 02:35:54 500 thousand goin to stocks, 500 thousand towards rent houses, 500 thousand gone fix some houses up and sell them bitches for higher, 200 hundred thousand gone start a clothing line, and 300, 000 getting stashed for a rainy day

3160 2018-01-30 02:25:42 The shorting that is occurring on quality stocks like $MMJ, $LIB, $NF and especially $LG is just a tactic to get cheap shares. For those that hold, you will be well rewarded. It’s all about patience and holding significant positions in quality stocks

3162 2018-01-30 02:23:48 I said GBTC is the best way to go because you’re diversified in the fund vs solely in BTC or other coins. Personally, I’d advise Any&everyone trading coins and not stocks to get familiar with Nasdaqs. Plenty of upside.
3163 2018-01-30 02:23:30 this new wave of bitcoin owners is why i say you guys need wall street help lol

bitcoins stocks are like insurance company stocks 

business model wise at least
3164 2018-01-30 02:22:24 Gotta get into stocks fr that’s where the bread at
3165 2018-01-30 02:22:13 Yes, stocks fluctuate. That's what they do. There is no such thing as a never-ending straight up chart. The overall trend during Obama era was terrific. FACT: DOW went from 7,500 when he took office to over 20,000 when he left. The question for Trump is: can he sustain it?
3166 2018-01-30 02:21:19 It’s for stocks
3167 2018-01-30 02:20:01 The market does not know if you are long or short and could not care less. forex stocks

3169 2018-01-30 02:18:55 Opening a new market and a new audience for American beers. As for the out of stocks...that was a combination of things. But that has been corrected and we look forward to what 2018 has to offer.
3170 2018-01-30 02:17:37 Sure hoping my weed stocks improve.  
3171 2018-01-30 02:17:37 Does @StocksToTrade only deal with US stocks or are there other stocks like Canadian ones for instance that we could analyze?
3172 2018-01-30 02:17:13 Clinton’s being jailed might also bring out a lot of enthusiasm. Gonna be a couple things that help us. You guys keep cheering for stocks to go down and us to fail. We hear every word #MAGA
3173 2018-01-30 02:16:14 I started checking out these stocks over the weekend and noticed the same thing. I bought my first Aussie stock last night, $CAN.ASX and I blame you for getting me checking the stock market at 6PM, much to my wife's chagrin. :/ :)

3192 2018-01-30 02:06:17 The stock market crashed 2008 because the players were afraid of what might happen with the history making election before them. It’s because they had no courage. I moved my 401 shares to housing and out if stocks. It’s more stable

3230 2018-01-30 01:41:00 I think you're right. And I was thinking along the same lines. I remember @DividendMaster & I saying over a year ago how a rate hike cycle would amplify the negatives. Debt service, debt, and stocks.

3239 2018-01-30 01:27:16 Is it common for stocks to be listed on NASDAQ  as well as OTC? Got stock which I thought was on NASDAQ, but trade confirmation said OTC. #nasdaq #otc #stocks #stockmarket @COFInvesting
3240 2018-01-30 01:26:52 I ignored your remark about my stocks. Your outlandish claim is childish at best.
3241 2018-01-30 01:26:37 Ok I would like an explanation of stocks, stock options and the stock market please
3242 2018-01-30 01:25:41 Actually many companies give their employees shares as a benefit

But even if you don't work in a big international company, you can buy shares of it, particularly dividend giving stocks, & receive part of the profits

3244 2018-01-30 01:24:28 The #Yen $JPY is barely higher (+.06%)... I don't think #Nikkei 225 has any real reasons to be trading down right now...

3249 2018-01-30 01:19:34 Yes it was. But such is the market. Take advantage of the good times but don’t sell stocks you believe in.
3250 2018-01-30 01:18:46 I would use those numbers as a pivot, these trades occurred after the close so I don’t know yet I’ll post more if I see more block trades on these stocks.
3251 2018-01-30 01:18:31 Yeah, red hats don't understand lagging indicators. Most of them don't even realize they don't own stocks, so the stock market doing well doesn't really mean jack for them.

3264 2018-01-30 01:12:51 Tanks will be empty before the cement casing dries on the first new wells   being drilled.

3265 2018-01-30 01:12:28 I really want to start investing in stocks. But trying to figure out what to invest in is hard affff.
3266 2018-01-30 01:11:57 Mike doesn’t have “millions of youtube money” do ur research, youtube makes him enough to live comfortably, besides he does have stocks, an investments im sure. So you’re stupid for that statement bud. Mike did way more even without spending money, just being there is more....
3267 2018-01-30 01:11:08 It will be nice to be able to buy from them but my big concern is not being able to move crypto to your account. I like to hold my own keys, but they state that even though you can buy and send, you cant receive. Some coins i buy to trade like stocks, that doesn't work for me.
3268 2018-01-30 01:10:20 Watch the news. You'll be able to see which companies are rising and which stocks are now available. For example that incident with United caused their stocks to plummet a couple of years ago, now that people forgot about it, its back up to normal and even higher.
3269 2018-01-30 01:09:50 Assuming stocks are stable as rates rise. Not sure bond prices and stocks ready to fall in tandem.
3270 2018-01-30 01:09:07 I have $10.00 in stocks, got them free from robinhood
3271 2018-01-30 01:08:21 The stock subscription services are continuing to churn out wishy-washy headlines as the whiplash continues this week. Last year was too easy as it's already become tough picking individual stocks vs the indices.
3272 2018-01-30 01:07:56 If silver according to the US debt clock is $1,000 per oz I am richer than many 26 year olds, $88,000 is the average retirement account for people over 57 years old. Good luck retirement. 206x$1000 in a few years you wish your stocks were silver ounces
3273 2018-01-30 01:06:56 Rush said SOTU should go like this.....

Good evening. The state of the Union is great. Unemployment is down, stocks are up, more companies and jobs coming. Law and order is being restored to our country. This is what winning looks like! Good night. 

Then.... drop the mic 
3274 2018-01-30 01:05:07 If you love the game of trading stocks even when you lose money, you'll do just fine.

Not loving trading will lead to an early divorce.

And, if you hate it, you will quit!

3277 2018-01-30 01:03:51 yield rise may have bumped off U.S. stocks from highs, but a correction was due after their recent gains," Ichikawa said.
3278 2018-01-30 01:03:48 After 1 year of presidency sky did not fall... World is in the most peaceful state. Stocks are high, gas is low, house & car  sales are high, unemployment is low, but if you listen to democrats...

3282 2018-01-30 01:00:43 No one of us know the future of any cryptocurrencies for all we know they can all be shit. As of now, all of them generated profits and grew in value. People have accepted the idea of crypto, people buy different stocks we don't know what will stick what will go but none're shit.
3283 2018-01-30 00:59:55 Makes me laugh when you (+most people) filter someone on lse they move on advfn. Or they begin turning up at your other stocks making the odd shite post really sad and obsessive behaviour poor people need lives or hobbies at least.
3284 2018-01-30 00:58:31 I like penny stocks. Galvanic Blast was a bit much at .70. I did buy a few here and there to make shipping worth it on some of these packages.

3298 2018-01-30 00:49:07 Oh, I think that's easy, they've been busy researching just how big their short positions will be on sterling, and which other stocks/shares to short.
3299 2018-01-30 00:48:57 My 401K did just as well this year as it did last 4 or 5 years. Thanks Obama!

Meanwhile, my accountant just told me I should get any part of my 401K that are in stocks out & put the money somewhere safer as there are signs the stock market bubble is about to burst. Thanks Trump!

3303 2018-01-30 00:43:20 The people of #AZ05 know Andy is evil, but they don't realize how DUMB he is. True story: After winning $10 million Sweepstakes, he invested in Kellogg's (NYSE: K) for the sole reason that he likes to eat Corn Flakes. He hasn't read "The Idiot's Guide to Buying Stocks."
3304 2018-01-30 00:41:14 5/ My stocks are up and my 401k is  looking like I may be able to retire after all. I thank God every night for putting Trump in the position that he’s in. He truly is #MAGA
3305 2018-01-30 00:41:09 Oh god I hope those poor folk get their money out in time, or that at least they haven't invested it all in stocks. 

You know, clichés are so apt at times ...

"What goes up, must come down".

Be careful folks.

3307 2018-01-30 00:40:39 So stocks have been a great "inflation" hedge
3308 2018-01-30 00:39:52 A analyst at #GoldmanSach's said a correction in the market may be coming. Based on what? Their desire to create volatility and hurt the small investor? @realDonaldTrump should tweet he sees the market heading to 40k thanks to a growing economy.#Stocks #investing #Business #MAGA

3310 2018-01-30 00:38:16 I think Americans would rather have a permanent pay raise, and affordable health benefits than a temporary bonus. But how would you understand you have both and plenty of stocks I'm sure.
3311 2018-01-30 00:37:56 2 ways to use stop losses:

1) fail safe to get out

2) sell with plan to buy at lower price. 

Use 2 if actively trading or still interested in security even if it drops lower.   Very useful for picking bottoms,  scalp #trading,  taking profits off a long term position. #stocks
3312 2018-01-30 00:37:39 @cvpayne  Bond markets spooking stocks? US, Germany and Japan recently broke out of long term up trends for the 10 year.

3314 2018-01-30 00:32:08 I wonder whether the reduction in taxes receipts as a percent of gdp as u have previously described is the result of stocks only going up, therefore no one is selling and paying capital gains?
3315 2018-01-30 00:31:54 I am literally opening the fridge and all the stocks in the kitchen over and over again just  to always get to the same conclusion that there is no delicious food  here for me

3326 2018-01-30 00:22:26 Also look into Personal Capital and Acorn (more on the stocks side)
3327 2018-01-30 00:22:18 ha ha ha..I don't think there will be crash but a pull back could be healthy and a possibility. But, lot of retail money is pouring in to stocks - a contrarian indicator?Time will tell but I am holding mostly cash with minor positions...
3328 2018-01-30 00:22:12 Y'all are insane... You must not study Wall Street or try to put a little away in a 401k... stocks a rising.. Not because of the past administration but because of this one.

3334 2018-01-30 00:18:15 Yeah I am postive too. I am a long hold for most of my stocks, I tend to be a bad Momo player and better at valuations
3335 2018-01-30 00:17:36 dude - I am an expert in these dividend stocks, and already have many of those - but your post has errors - $COST dividend is 1% and there is no stock $ABBC  you probably meant $ABB
3336 2018-01-30 00:13:34 don't know stocks coz I am not trading equities, but it's certainly working on the indices 
3337 2018-01-30 00:11:31 Let's talk tomatoes. Many green grocers stock only juiceless, flesh heavy tomatoes that are great for salads & sandwiches. But many dishes need juicy tomatoes that have less flesh. Luckily my green grocer stocks them, but many don't. Keep asking for them until they stock both.
