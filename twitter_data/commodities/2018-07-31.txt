9 2018-07-31 23:15:41 First, if the claim is that "values are made up", then I don't disagree at all. 

I see "value" as being a meaningful concept with reference to any purpose of any kind, while "money" and "commodities" are only meaningful with reference to specific historical/social conditions. >>
10 2018-07-31 23:09:05 Oh please, farmers have been hurting for decades. A better question is. Why has the price of all farm grown commodities not risen in price since the mid 70's while the other countries prices have skyrocketed? Look it up corn, soy, potatoes none have had a significant increase.
11 2018-07-31 23:01:40 Eso coincido. Por eso son kirchnerismo de buenos modales. Y la pobreza del 54% la bajaron los precios de los commodities. Averiguá en cuanto estaba el precio cuando lo rajan a Lopez Murphy y cuanto a mediados del 2003. Ah, la devaluacion ...

42 2018-07-31 21:15:13 I'd say the trade is pretty even.  There is a lot of upside in B, but A is a proven stud.  I still favor proven commodities over potential, so I have to say A gets the slight nod.  It could work out to be a homerun in the long run, but I think for this year, A definitely "wins".

47 2018-07-31 20:59:57 Instead of paying farm corps to not grow crops in order to lower supply relative to demand, the government should purchase those commodities at the lowest reasonable market rate and then distribute them charitably or, where appropriate, to school lunch programs.

56 2018-07-31 20:16:35 You're talking about unproven players filling in for known commodities. Honestly, I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm saying it's not a foregone conclusion that those guys can fill those holes as easily as you think.

57 2018-07-31 20:08:31 US and Chinese negotiating on defusing tradewar is giving commodity futures a boost. I believe most of the commodities will have a short term rally the upcoming weeks.

64 2018-07-31 19:30:00 The Scotiabank Commodity Price Index declined by 2.7% m/m in June as industrial commodities fell back on fears that a US-led trade dispute would dent global economic growth and depress the world’s demand for raw materials. #CdnEcon #ScotiabankEconomics

74 2018-07-31 18:42:25 That's assuming that we all could afford the chance to apply ourselves. Success costs money and not all of our families had it. However, yes, any full time worker should be able to afford basic rent and commodities

81 2018-07-31 18:16:20 Now some of those strategies took TA concepts and took them to the next level, but they wouldn’t be looking at charts. For example quantitatively identifying patterns.

90 2018-07-31 17:32:33 Correct. I just hate how in these situations we tend to revert to language that perpetuates the toxic perception of minor league players as commodities rather than people, even though other times we know better

92 2018-07-31 17:22:45 El incremento de las exportaciones entre 2003 y 2011 (producto d la devaluación de Duhalde y del boom d commodities) proveyó los dólares para q aumentara el consumo interno. El aumento d costos en dólares entre 2010 y 2011 y la caída d los commodities abortó las exportaciones.

99 2018-07-31 17:01:36 I love your term 'the speculative arts.' And I agree that it's a great tool and, even in its purest incarnation (eg. commodities trading) completely legitimate and even necessary for the functioning of markets. But I'd argue it's a totally different animal from value investing.
100 2018-07-31 16:59:59 Tech disruption often in industries not previously identified as plunderable....

3D printing available to the mass market means that commodities once unavailable to the population due to the market can suddenly be.

i.e. 3D printed cosmetics or pharmaceuticals
101 2018-07-31 16:59:11 I mean, that's only true because there are other farmers raising chickens / eggs, and probably doing so successfully because they protect them. If no farmers protected their commodities...
102 2018-07-31 16:56:52 If Americans are concerned about Russia, they should be furious with our gov for letting China but US energy, food & tech companies et al.

111 2018-07-31 16:16:39 Present prices of essential commodities also show that agriculture too had done well in last few years with prices lowest in the present times.  Honestly, family had left the pulses & was purely on vegetables but now started using a bit now.  "6.7% in June"

113 2018-07-31 16:02:02 I also heard a theory that #Chinese companies and running down their stores of #Cobalt to reduce prices and then Force 1 to 3 year forward supply contracts at lower prices.
Which has occurred a previously in other commodities such as #ironore.
114 2018-07-31 15:57:51 I wouldn't be happy to lose JOC but football is a business and players are commodities that are there to be traded. Clubs need to make money to survive and thrive. I appreciate players are on contracts and they should be honoured but who are we as a club to stand in the lads way.

We get commodities food which is basically the stuff the grocery stores are throwing out. 
And yes, we use it.
117 2018-07-31 15:45:54 Es que el populismo y politiquería de el actual presidente y sus Ministros no tiene límites, han sido extremadamente poco serios al culpar al gob anterior del deterioro económico, casi tratándonos de mentirosos por culpar a la economía internacional y el precio de los commodities
118 2018-07-31 15:45:38 I've been receiving whatsapp messages of institutions asking for students to be referred to them because they don't have enough students enrolled?! 

Are students commodities now guys?? What are you offering students that should make them want to enroll???!
119 2018-07-31 15:41:31 I'm hoping you will dry up and be gone as soon as possible. FACT: commodities UP b/c of your blustering tariffs. YOU are the fake news!
120 2018-07-31 15:39:20 Building materials: UP 50%. Commodities: also way up? WHY?  Dt tariffs.  And do you all really think he's making america great again?! Moron-in-chief!
121 2018-07-31 15:31:17 Not the only reason Art but OK. There is a War against commodities because it's the enemy of our failed Keynesian system & paper money. State just continuing Pretend & Extend of our "Weekend At Bernies" fragile economy. Price controls create shortages & end in chaotic increases.

125 2018-07-31 14:54:24 Prospects are unproven commodities.  Some turn out to be good/great players and many do not.  If you can make a move to better your team who is in “win now” mode you do it.  Reference the Pedro Martinez-Jaret Wright deal from the late 90s that was never made.

132 2018-07-31 14:27:13 Holding stake in a commodity over a 24/7 exchange is far favorable to me than buying commodities from present day brokers
133 2018-07-31 14:21:05 The plan since Thatcher - including Blair & New Labour, an essential part of Neoliberalist & Globalist philosophy. Trade is for commodities... Heathcare, Water, Power are not. Society is held together by these necessities which should all be under government control for society.

136 2018-07-31 14:14:00 Cheap online shopping may end soon why?  The government of India is contemplating tightening the noose around deep discounting  a practice lowering prices on e-commerce platforms such as Amazon and Flipkart. People of India used to get commodities at a lower price.
137 2018-07-31 14:13:59 there appears to be a topping pattern happening in the US dollar. will be good for commodities  once it breaks
138 2018-07-31 14:10:20 The fps dealer has an added advantage that people will come to him ,they can always increase their business by selling other commodities .
139 2018-07-31 14:09:50 They show no skills in international business or management. They seem not to understand standard trade terminology, balance of trade, commodities sectors or multiparty negotiation. It's not impossible for arts majors to learn about business, it takes dedicated extensive reading!
140 2018-07-31 14:06:52 Then the government should also pay salaries to the farmers as well as the grow food grains.

Look the fair price shop dealer gets tje Commission for whatever is sold . They can increase their output by selling other commodities
141 2018-07-31 14:06:02 I personally do not believe in TA for crypto. Maybe for small movements short term, but crypto to me is truly a mystery. It seems like no one really knows what is going on behind curtains.

145 2018-07-31 13:48:40 Hmmm. In that specific sentence, I don’t know that microhistories works, but commodity histories (or object biographies/biographies of commodities) does. That specific sentence reads like that’s the full definition of microhistory.

154 2018-07-31 13:18:32 Growth slowed in EMs, which cut demand for commodities, including oil. At the same time, US oil production was accelerating due to technology improvements. The combination of oversupply and falling demand, led to an energy sector “recession,” which spilled over into other sectors
155 2018-07-31 13:10:28 Good news! We will now see cheese in the government commodities we receive at the food pantry where I volunteer. Our clients love cheese. The farm bill is always interesting.

156 2018-07-31 13:08:33 Also using our country to broker deals all over the world to enrich his own family.  Add tariffs to all sorts of commodities, which has resulted in us having to borrow 13 billion from China to give a handout to the farmers because of said tariffs.
157 2018-07-31 13:02:31 Because something like that would both make sense and help reform people, and doing something that makes sense and reforming people is sadly not what our justice system is about anymore. Now that the prison system has by and large become privatized, humans are commodities.

What do you use for illegals who are  dumped on us. And what are they killing ?
168 2018-07-31 12:14:29 Socialism would still produce commodities. The difference is that those who produced the commodities would control the conditions of their labour and receive the value their labour is worth.

171 2018-07-31 12:07:42 I have this huge fascination for #commodities; How they are farmed, mined, or produced. I have the #database experience to grow your company and secure your shipping. Someone needs to take a chance. #commodityresourcingandtrading
172 2018-07-31 11:56:03 2) 
1-China will fold like the EU did and drop the tax.
2- China will buy US beans from a 3rd Party (from other country) and over look the fact they are US origin. 

They are doing this now. If your in that business then you know commodities are often resold while in transit.
173 2018-07-31 11:55:58 Russia reminds me of Serbia in 1990s Yugoslavia. So many short term wins, but the inevitability of eventual failure. Putin short term tactician with no real long term strategic vision. (badly structured economy wildly over-reliant on commodities and beset by endemic corruption).
174 2018-07-31 11:55:03 With all the blunders and tenderprenuering around basic food commodities like maize/rice/sugar, Strategic reserves and fertilizer prices, things will be extremely challenging. If global fuel price goes up for any one reason- Iran-USA, hostility, it will worsen things.
175 2018-07-31 11:54:46 To bad its a ginned up GDP by Trump's fake trade war. Real GDP when you remove pre-sales of Soybeans & other commodities were 1.2%  which is what it will be next quorter right before we go into recession, but nice ignorant try.

178 2018-07-31 11:22:10 The business community are clamoring for TRAIN 2. Financial experts are endorsing TRAIN 2. Rising prices of oil and commodities is a GLOBAL issue, NOT just LOCAL.

179 2018-07-31 11:19:07 The Philippines has no respect for the environment or commodities made by raw materials. I have no compassion for these serial wasters.

181 2018-07-31 11:09:49 Duterte's not the kind of leader that makes decisions based on consensus. He do what he thinks is right. Unfortunately, senators and congressmen are worried about their political careers. They fear losing if they approve TRAIN2 and it ends up affecting commodities.

189 2018-07-31 10:20:30 We kampen met het "eigen bodem" syndroom. Zoals fossiele grondstoffen moeten ook de nieuwe commodities "biomassa" en "groene waterstof" uit de wereldhandel komen. Groene peak shaving stroom deels ook via het E-koppelnet van CSP/PV centrales in Noord-Afrika.
190 2018-07-31 10:13:10 You can't entirely blame that on the government and their policies. Over the course of the time we had a National government, we have transformed our economy from that of primarily commodities, to now where tourism is our largest export. ----

210 2018-07-31 07:56:50 The internment of Japanese Americans in World War II was something I would never condone. However what he did do economically was provide jobs that the private sector could not accommodate. That created a large commodities market.

212 2018-07-31 07:51:50 Your interpretation skills are shite. The whole point of my tweet was that whether you think animal products are healthy or not is ultimately irrelevant. Animals are still sentient beings, and you're not entitled to treat them as if they were commodities.

240 2018-07-31 05:38:40 The author of the source quote doesn’t mention the Commodities Futures Modernization Act of 2000 as the enabler of legal standing for CDS. Small oversight? Surely you recognize its relevance.
241 2018-07-31 05:35:55 one way to get back at US would be if they paired commodities to $BTC

Your Saheb is history...

Will be remembered only for

-  cheating people sp. Farmers
- rising prices of commodities and giving nothing to farmers
- contribution to blood politics
248 2018-07-31 04:29:12 Okay although we arm chair psychologists have diagnosed donny over the waterfall what we know is, by his own words and deeds, he sees women as commodities not people. From that we can surmise he has difficulty w interpersonal relationships which are founded on truth & trust.
249 2018-07-31 04:20:46 Plus, they need to have time to innovate, educate themselves. People have time for that now because commodities are extremely cheap due to, again, capitalism and free market. How does capitalism stop scientists?

256 2018-07-31 03:14:11 Like they did in the past, Trump should buy those soybeans and distribute them to the poor. I got "commodities" when I was a staving student on the GI Bill in the 70's. Mmmmm, gubmint cheese and canned mystery meat, good stuff.

259 2018-07-31 02:58:14 People have always been commodities in political spheres. Drugs obtained illegally escalates risk. It concerns me that cheap & dangerous drugs are being used as a type of warfare to weaken our society. IMO legal means increases the known variables & improves safe use.
260 2018-07-31 02:56:13 Damn tell that to their kids. Players aren’t commodities smh.

It is already happening all around us. It's just a matter of time until all communities, assets and services become digital commodities.

Art and creativity will be king then.

The ratchet is moving slowly.
264 2018-07-31 02:45:06 Each nation can then manage its domestic energy policy based on this firm ratio; deficits/surpluses related to energy/commodities would be settled in the neutral reserve asset.  

Markets would do the rest...
265 2018-07-31 02:43:52 Inflation is only being used to justify rice tariffication when it is actually the TRAIN Law and the continuous oil price hikes that contributed to the increase in the prices of basic commodities @BantayBigas
266 2018-07-31 02:40:39 I think you are following the wrong people bro. I mean you do you, but there are very few pro penny stock traders. Eventually, you’ll figure out you should learn to trade with the big boys on REAL companies, commodities, and futures. At least my opinion is drop penny stocks ASAP
267 2018-07-31 02:35:01 And other valued commodities from California! Of course he would cripple California. And doing so cripples our country. Sad

272 2018-07-31 02:12:05 ar·bi·trage
ˈärbəˌträZH/Submit
noun
1.
the simultaneous buying and selling of securities, currency, or commodities in different markets or in derivative forms in order to take advantage of differing prices for the same asset.
273 2018-07-31 01:55:11 You realise the contradiction? By refusing to be commodities (which no one today even considers) and suggesting you won't settle for someone not worthy, is in itself, commoditising yourself.
274 2018-07-31 01:51:25 How the commodities markets influence farm production/operation/economics.
275 2018-07-31 01:24:58 Commodities have industrial demand that set a baseline value for them. Companies can choose to forward purchase them if the price drops too much, to lock in future profits and lower costs of inventory. Where does the baseline industrial demand for crypto come from?
276 2018-07-31 01:21:24 Instead of being recalcitrant your response is “whataboutism?”

You mean when I launched fair launch proof of work coins, which are regulated as commodities and that I put my name on and to which I am fully accountable?

That you don’t see the difference speaks volumes.

278 2018-07-31 01:15:15 That's a very valid point. But I think, cryptos will have a very similar market cap analysis as commodities.
279 2018-07-31 01:13:01 There are no metrics established for tokens yet. Who knows if there will be in the future. Metrics change if a stock is oversold overtime I believe, which would change its value. Commodities don't have producing asset metrics as they are hard assets.

281 2018-07-31 01:09:30 It’s how Che is appropriated by companies who sell commodities on his name. It’s hard for them not to sell leftist political anthems
282 2018-07-31 01:06:17 Actually, access to social interaction outside the workplace has relieved us of the notion that we are market commodities and so we are instead living our best lives and refusing to settle for partners who aren't worth us.
283 2018-07-31 01:03:03 I wonder if posthumous image replication rights start to resemble tradable commodities, like music publishing rights have become. And if so, what’s the celebrity image version of Michael Jackson buying the Beatles catalogue?
284 2018-07-31 00:49:18 Great advice. 

Plot the spot return vs the futures return and they are very different historically.  Convenience yield carry is big in commodities, I think its the only asset where arbitrage exists? (albeit, with a high barrier...eg, u need to rent a tanker to store oil lol)

287 2018-07-31 00:39:22 In this audiobook, a planet is so obsessed with cryofreezing people (supposedly to preserve them till a time period when they'll be able to live longer lives) that the corporations competing over cryofreezing contracts are selling the contracts as commodities ROFL.
288 2018-07-31 00:38:02 It's impossible to sell the whole quantity of any asset. Same goes with stocks or commodities.
289 2018-07-31 00:36:19 The more you consume, the less you live. Commodities are the opium of the people.
290 2018-07-31 00:15:51 I like the trade b/c of the two 1st rounders. We get 2 unknown commodities (picks) for 1 unknown (Manziel). Westerman & Williams are 2 impact players compared to a serviceable OL & a backup OL. Of course, this all depends on if Johnny pans out or flames out.
291 2018-07-31 00:08:33 Very tru...but I believe u need both, a good system allows u to make the adjustments to win and keep winning. If u don’t have a good system and are not winning, trade good commodities 4 top prospects n then do better job of drafting.
