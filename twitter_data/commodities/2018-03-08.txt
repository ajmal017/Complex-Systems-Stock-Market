40 2018-03-08 22:34:40 The latter. One of the unfortunate side-effects of the fetishization of female virginity and seeing women as a sexual commodities. Ah...instutional misogyny. Such a treat.
41 2018-03-08 22:30:27 I think it's the blanket commodity protectionism. Specific industries are different than steel or coal. Commodities are less subject to preferences

#Impeach45
44 2018-03-08 22:27:53 Chuck... Rethink it... Basic economics 101... Countries have been pumping us full of cheap commodities with no reciprocation for decades & stealing American jobs... There will be an adjustment period but, US production will crank up & people will begin shunning foreign goods...
45 2018-03-08 22:20:25 When China steals ‘Intellectual Property’ & R&D from USA Corporations, & then comes out quickly and more cheaply with knock-off versions, what should be cutting edge products for 5 yrs., become commodities in 2 or 3 years. Less jobs & higher salaries are prevented as a result!
46 2018-03-08 22:04:56 Not yet.  Using it as leverage in NAFTA negotiations.  If these 2 countries don’t come to table for fair trade, then he will use tariffs on these commodities
47 2018-03-08 22:04:45 Don't  treat  people  like  commodities 
48 2018-03-08 22:03:31 New York State?  All of the above?  None?  Wanna flip for it?  In all seriousness, a federal district judge in NY has also said they're commodities. And members of the House are drafting legislation to pull more into SEC.
49 2018-03-08 21:55:36 And if you knew business history. Strength of country comes from importing Commodities shipping manufactured goods. The sellout by globalist was treason. But that's what the Clinton NAFTA bill was and the DNC is sellouts to the American worker @realDonaldTrump #Fairtrade
50 2018-03-08 21:48:16 Kinship became less prominent in cultural anthropology, but the Q 'are brides gifts or commodities?' has been critically investigated by feminist anthros Hoskins (2004) in 'Slaves, Brides and Other 'Gifts',' or Margaret Jolly (2015)
51 2018-03-08 21:47:54 Something i s seriously wrong with human beings who treat animals as commodities!
52 2018-03-08 21:46:52 Because their production cost is so low the tariff doesn't make much of a difference and since you're in freight, what are tariffs on most commodities in the us like?
53 2018-03-08 21:44:55 I have to ask a simple question on cryptos - if the CFTC says cryptos are commodities how can they be securities? Haven’t seen too many wheat farmers slapped by the SEC claiming they are selling a security. If I trade my corn for your wheat am I in trouble?

56 2018-03-08 21:37:24 Is comparative advantage worth putting a price ceiling on commodities? The figures from GDBush tariffs don't account for UC benefits etc...
57 2018-03-08 21:31:40 The quoted representatives didn't make an economic argument, and I'd suggest that if Americans are to work in industry at all, they're better off making high value manufactured goods than low value commodities.

62 2018-03-08 21:13:03 Look deeper and you'll see what a birth cert. really is and how the rule of law in courts can differ between USA and US. It's meant to confuse by design for entrapment, we are just commodities under US Corporation. I could be wrong, but it's how I understood it.
63 2018-03-08 21:09:47 Sounds interesting. I have heard birth certificates are (we are from birth) used as commodities to debt for governments/ banks. If you do go ahead with it, I look forward to seeing how you go about investigating/ explaining it from birth going forward. Best of luck with it!

(Entrevista com o ministro Henrique Meirelles em ‘OESP’, 4 de mar.)
70 2018-03-08 20:49:56 Academics are market-oriented intellectuals whose goal is to turn all human potential into capitalist commodities.
71 2018-03-08 20:47:04 I agree man and it's not a commodity like a lot of other things are.  I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm not necessarily frustrated with people as much as I am with music itself being disvalued.  I can't blame people man money is hard to come by and commodities aren't cheap
72 2018-03-08 20:45:50 If u can't handle #bitcoin regulation, stick with those sell orders n call it quits. It's going to happen. Furthermore, any native token (primary network token like $BTC / $LTC) has already been ruled as commodities (like gold)...only #ICO tokens r securities (like stocks). #DYOR

74 2018-03-08 20:40:36 I would take you over Gove, Johnson and the rest of the leavers. When we see ppl as commodities, we can have all the homeless and poverty afflicting this country. Brexit allows this kind of thinking.
75 2018-03-08 20:37:38 On this #InternationalWomensDay let's remember that under capitalism women will always be oppressed and seen as commodities.
76 2018-03-08 20:15:48 Bitcoin and many others act as commodities not securities. Most ICOs are scam securities skirting regulations to steal from unaware people. This is not a bad thing. If you're against this you're probably profiting from ICOs.
77 2018-03-08 20:14:25 I more blame the mentality of parental rights over kids’ rights. Children have no real agency. They are basically treated like commodities in our culture. Until you’re 18 you’re not a person in a lot of ways. It’s bizarre and dysfunctional.
78 2018-03-08 20:05:15 I'm fine with that. There's value in treating your people like more than just commodities; it's value that they've regularly extracted over the years. It's also perfectly fine if the value that you get from a player is his play for you at the agreed-upon salary.
79 2018-03-08 20:03:41 I mean I have no idea how you can cope with country-of-orign issues when it comes to commodities which are largely fungible. Chinese steel imports will just get rerouted via Canada and Mexico…
80 2018-03-08 20:02:27 The point is that both Mexico and Canada do deals with China and cheap commodities flow into the US. Same with drugs, meth, fentanyl, heroin. China is breaking the one breaking the rules but Mexico and Canada also profit from the trade
81 2018-03-08 19:59:01 hate that, in my pushback against the destabilization of self through rapid commodity trend production in this mess of a technocapitalist economy, ive begun to actively resist any kind of engagement with commodities that i feel increase my risk of impermanence
82 2018-03-08 19:57:35 Right, so the real risk you are taking is, could your underlying move enough in a flash (before you have enough time to manage) to cause greater than 2x loss? If you are using commodities or decent ETFs, staying out < 15 delta, entering with 100 DTE....highly unlikely.
83 2018-03-08 19:52:33 Forex e commodities ainda são pouco explorados pelas publicações brasileiras.
84 2018-03-08 19:51:47 Us farmers are worried about the commodities they have to sell in a year that everything is down. Not the price of steel.
85 2018-03-08 19:51:43 EU, Arab countries and Canada can buy commodities in Asia and South America. Tariffs imposed by trump will be a boon to China and Russia and EU.
86 2018-03-08 19:51:11 Exclusions is the beginning of the trade war. Now its perfectly clear , he was targeting nations not the over supply of commodities

90 2018-03-08 19:38:39 Absolutely.  Many utility tokens likely could qualify as commodities if they have a real consumer purpose and aren’t being marketed and sold to investors.  The problem here, in large part, isn’t the law; it’s the desire by funds, VCs, etc. to gain direct exposure.
91 2018-03-08 19:35:16 Hopefully, your pocket’s full, otherwise, you won’t have enough to buy a new car, canned food and other commodities that are made of steel/aluminum.
92 2018-03-08 19:32:48 Ik ben, met anderen, van mening dat mensen zoals #ING CEO #Hamers en types (!) als ex-Shellbaas Jeroen v.d. Veer in een parallel universum leven. ‘Gewone’ mensen die hebben te werken voor levensonderhoud worden gezien als ‘commodities’ nodig voor het welzijn en succes van henzelf
93 2018-03-08 19:31:46 The capitalist market deems it necessary to identify those who are receptive to various commodities, and so successfully carries realization of value to fulfilment.

98 2018-03-08 19:09:06 CFTC has the power to regulate commodities, including spot, at least according to one well respected Federal Judge's order. Most commodities are not used as payment instruments. Then again, most securities are not used as payment instruments either.

123 2018-03-08 17:20:56 Anyoneon remember when President Trump got that lne for 2 billion did he pay any tax with it thats the question. If it's park folk demand commodities how about a picnic table and a solid camp ground.
124 2018-03-08 17:18:18 Buddy it restored regulations of derivatives to the standard the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (CEA), that were previously gutted by the Commodities Futures modernization act passed by  Clinton. Dod-Frank did not sperate commercial and investment banking "dumbass".
125 2018-03-08 17:16:18 #OBAMA's #FED may have so disoriented the credit markets they may NOT be able to transition back to a REAL "Market" (meaning they actually function without govt MANIPULATION)=we could be looking at equity and commodities markets that potentially just collapse due to dependencies
126 2018-03-08 17:12:20 Fans are turned into commodities but let me put a twist on this: it's good and fine and makes people happy
127 2018-03-08 17:12:13 #Commodities #usda #wheat #agriculture Russain wheat exports at 37.50 MMT Vs 36.00 MMT in Feb = +4.17% = Main change on wheat !
128 2018-03-08 17:09:20 The main difference is that Petro is backed up by commodities such as oil.
129 2018-03-08 17:06:44 I’ve been managing an unconstrained global tactical go-anywhere across world markets portfolio since 2005. Pre-'08 I had heavy Latin America exposure & other commodity-producing emerging markets since commodities where strong Then, as seen in the chart, the US has led since.
130 2018-03-08 17:05:52 Every regulatory body is looking to bring #cryptos under their umbrella. @CFTC is taking a stance of cryptos as commodities, @SEC_News wants the utility tokens to be securities, #FInCEN says they’re “generally” money & #WyomingBill classifies it as property.
131 2018-03-08 17:03:05 #ThursdayThoughts Whether cryptocurrencies are viewed as securities or commodities is important - I'm just an observationist - if the market value of the reward for mining drops below the cost of mining, then miners will stop mining. - #BASICMATH

133 2018-03-08 16:57:03 I have slightly different view..you got economy bottoming out,lower global inflation,benign financial conditions and lowest crude-commodities prices
.but u missed the opportunity because you fallen for efficient UPA..that's curse on us,politicians following same discredited model
134 2018-03-08 16:55:41 yeah but to be fair Japan tariffs on select major Ag products are off the charts and Canada maintains supply quotas on ag commodities like dairy
135 2018-03-08 16:54:34 @officialmcafee I read this yesterday               A U.S. district judge has backed the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission in defining cryptocurrencies as commodities. If true can exchanges use this as they’re “exemption” to not register with the sec? How about a follow?!
136 2018-03-08 16:50:20 The fun in commodities. “Yes it’s more expensive.” “Why?” “Do you watch the news?”
137 2018-03-08 16:49:54 Brian, don't you know you HAVE to gauge your fandom based solely off of stat lines? These are not people under the helmets, they are commodities. How dare you get attached to a player!
138 2018-03-08 16:47:36 Commodities should be played by experts as when people unaware of the particular commodity often gets trapped and if there in any profit, mostly remains on paper. Traders get trapped quite often, and eventually becomes investors waiting for next run in that particular commodity
139 2018-03-08 16:44:05 Don't be a commodity of a woman! Commodities are cheap!  Brands are sought after. Brands are influential.  So deliberately transform yourself into a BRAND.

147 2018-03-08 16:10:17 being Illinois is mostly agrarian society, if we are economically budget shortfall, its due to the fact we are not producing high dollar commodities at the farm level. if we want to be economic cash rich state, we should grow cash crops and nothing else.
148 2018-03-08 16:09:02 The two main differences are that is the first currency launched by a government and the second one is that is backed up by commodities (such as oil, for example)
149 2018-03-08 16:06:20 $DXY now above 90. If it can break resistance at 91 soon, we are going to see a major correction in commodities and equities.
150 2018-03-08 16:05:54 i think Global tariff on commodities does impact India both ways...as it will have -ve impact on commodity prices and in turn will impact on Metal companies which have seen revival in fortune very recently in last couple of years and positively impact companies like Mahindra.

157 2018-03-08 15:56:39 I'll find the studies ASAP  but I remember reading that a higher minimum wage does raise prices marginally for commodities like fast-food but other costs of living don't inflate nearly enough to offset the raise to $15/hr
158 2018-03-08 15:54:24 Comment from the floor at #WCTOH2018 that perhaps we should be having a world conference on unhealthy commodities rather than focusing on single commodities like tobacco

160 2018-03-08 15:49:55 @elite dangerous i think i have a solution to a few problems. to make mining more profitable what if we gave it a tag like the illegal and stolen cargo? and we use this tag to differentiate between mined cargo and normal commodities. (suggestgion will continue in comments)

190 2018-03-08 14:46:14 I'm pretty sure she was referring to commodities with the petro-dollar being the ultimate Anglo-Zionist commodity that sheds innocent blood for the sake of Empire, and demented glory. I don't think Syria, Iran, Russia, China or North Korea want any part of the petrodollar.
191 2018-03-08 14:44:21 certainly not, but it makes much more than commodities.
192 2018-03-08 14:40:50 No, they aren't commodities to me. But given how many unwanted and abused children are in this world, it's wonderful to have children being loved and raised by families who want them. Do you feel the same way about heterosexual couples adopting children?
193 2018-03-08 14:36:20 There are too many lawyers in Washington.Clearly adept at twisting words to suit their own purposes, they create a climate where trust and loyalty are dismissed as commodities. The smallest words are used to destroy and/or create suspicions that can be sold to the public.
194 2018-03-08 14:36:08 What does best adjusted mean? Because they're both commodities-dependent, one is so closed as to basically be off-limits for even Russian and Chinese businesses outside of very small ventures/natural gas, nor does Russia have the resources or China the interest to help TM. etc.

197 2018-03-08 14:24:35 Awesome. So glad to see health included here, too. So many of our problems and injustices stem from commodifying things that aren’t commodities, which ironically robs them of their actual value in people’s eyes.

202 2018-03-08 14:08:59 I presume it was a standard weight used for measuring commodities.
203 2018-03-08 14:03:06 Also worth mention is the fact that the state's inability to export energy commodities like coal brings the domestic supply up and the price down for the ordinary North Korean trying to heat their home or engage in biz. Not all sanction side affects are bad

225 2018-03-08 12:22:24 @ChrisCuomo If Canada and Mexico are now going to be exempt from the tariffs, are they not the 2 biggest suppliers of those commodities to us? That means his tariff policy is not stopping anything except alienating us with our allies.  He's not helping the steel industry either.

227 2018-03-08 12:04:56 Failure and success are commodities on offer to everyone all over the world and every individual and every country makes a choice of which to buy and i will say on our behalf that we will choose success - Prof Yemi Osinbajo
228 2018-03-08 12:03:23 We never know when the economic cycle is going to end.  Because cycles are difficult to time, commodities typically outperform during the latter stages of the cycle.  2007 was no different. Front month crude oil futures went up 130% in '07 just when the economy was about to crash
229 2018-03-08 12:01:59 I was fortunate to participate in #Bloomberg’s Top ETF Trade Ideas Panel in Dec 17 and I mentioned #commodities on the panel and afterwards. People looked at me like I had 3 heads.  Astoria’s investment approach is forward looking whereas most portfolios are backward looking.
230 2018-03-08 12:01:31 this slow expansion of markets has many concomitants which co-evolve: how labour is supplied ("commodification of labour"); how capital is accumulated (as  seeds in a granary, or in money, etc.); what kind of things gets exchanged (luxuries, commodities, services)
231 2018-03-08 12:01:21 Astoria began investing in commodities & commodity equities last year. We thought in a world where US stock and bond valuations were rich, commodities offered better risk adjusted returns. In fact, when we published our 2018 outlook, commodities was our 2nd most important theme.
232 2018-03-08 12:00:16 It’s really a head scratcher to be buying US equities at these valuation levels especially when they are up 380% since '09.  Your incremental $ should be going into cheaper equities (#EM, #Japan, #Europe, #Value), #commodities (#energy, #metals, #aggs), or #liquid #alternatives.
233 2018-03-08 11:57:51 Happy International Women’s Day to all the beautiful women across the world. Know that you are timeless commodities that are worthy of praise every single day. May we continue to empower each other, love each other and stand up for each other! #IWD2018 #BlueDevil
234 2018-03-08 11:50:48 The TRAIN Law was supposed to help low income Filipinos but here is what happened since the law was passed: 

- Prices of basic commodities has increased.
- GRAB, UBER, and Taxi fares have gone up.

235 2018-03-08 11:49:08 regulations = good for retail smart money, non regulated commodities / securities will suffer in the interim (but not all hope is lost, its a fast evolving space, and internal regulatory bodies are already on their way)...wouldn't say completely clueless, maybe just alarmist.
236 2018-03-08 11:46:48 So @CFTC says #cryptos are commodities, @SEC_News says #utilitytokens are securities, #FInCEN says they’re “generally” money & #Wyoming says they’re property (traditionally purview of the states). I’m sensing litigation is coming.

238 2018-03-08 11:41:36 if stocks were short of just one of the commodity, or shortage at one location, we could have accepted it as clerical error, corrupt staffer etc
but stocks missing for all commodities and all stocks tell me one thing, it was all a ponzi scheme, all was fraud, may be hawala racket

The President implores the local government to stop taxing gonja vendors. He says its best to tax other commodities but not these.

240 2018-03-08 11:30:09 Like manufacturing is already doomed. If cost of energy is over the roof, there's no way manufacturing can flourish. Cost of petroleum and power is high. And those two energy commodities are what industries use. 

So it begs the question, how will manufacturing prosper?
241 2018-03-08 11:25:43 wat een onzin allemaal. buitenland is irrelevant. USA is de grootste economie. de dollar (ergo US T-bonds) is dus de vluchthaven (meest risk off safe asset) en goud/zilver/commodities crashen samen met de aandelen

352 2018-03-08 01:43:58 Lord forbid they raffle off legal commodities. Just because you don't like them doesn't mean you get final say in what other communities can do.
353 2018-03-08 01:39:59 If the #CFTC is treating  #cryptos as commodities does that mean any bitcoin or crypto broker needs to be registered with the CFTC?
354 2018-03-08 01:34:05 The corporate definition of love is obsessed with commodities, property, and hoarding of things and experiences.
355 2018-03-08 01:28:31 Fun fact: There is no good Japanese word for commodities. 商品 and 一次産品 are commonly used. The former is technically correct but sounds wrong. The latter sounds correct but is technically wrong.
356 2018-03-08 01:22:26 CFTC says cryptos are commodities, SEC says utility tokens are securities, FInCEN says they’re “generally” money & Wyoming says they’re property... Everyone is trying to get a slice of the pie

357 2018-03-08 01:20:04 "And this holds good, even if the domestic commodities are of poorer quality, or even higher priced. For it would be better to pay for an article two dollars which remain in the country than only one which goes out, however strange this may seem to the uninformed." Hörnigk, 1684
358 2018-03-08 01:09:59 And Kirill Dimitriev, who is close to Putin, just happened to fly in to the Seychelles on a private jet so he could bump into Erik Prince in a bar for 38 minutes of commodities discussion. Yeah, sure!

361 2018-03-08 00:57:51 Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies Are Commodities, Federal Court Rules...
362 2018-03-08 00:57:03 Steel and aluminum are signal-value commodities for an industrial base. 

I suspect if you actually wanted to do trade arm twisting and tradeoff jobs vs growth, you'd target manufactured intermediates like subassemblies or parts.
363 2018-03-08 00:52:15 Countries keep USD reserves so they can create a pseudo-USD currency peg. This peg connects other countries to commodities through the USD pricing mechanism. There is a clear relationship between the inflated monetary system and real commodities and commodity money = gold.
364 2018-03-08 00:51:28 If scared of chashes and panic and trade war: buy gold.

If scared of inflation ( thats me) ; buy commodities in general.
365 2018-03-08 00:34:47 Imagine #China being the sole provider of #steel to the #US  That would mean they have #America by the balls. They could sanction America and send the US economy into abyss. 

That's why steel as well as other commodities and industries are so important.

366 2018-03-08 00:33:00 The problem is: we cannot, in the end, debate liberalism, properly understood as Being. Capitalism has rendered us commodities to be priced and sold because this truth has been sacrificed for systematic progress and power politics. THIS is what needs to be debated. @benshapiro
367 2018-03-08 00:26:27 CFTC itself scoring a win this week when a U.S. district judge ruled that cryptocurrencies are commodities on Tuesday - all but confirming the position it staked out back in 2015.
368 2018-03-08 00:08:14 things which should not be commodities and people should get for free:

food
