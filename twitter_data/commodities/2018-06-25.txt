6 2018-06-25 23:17:59 Don't forget interest rate rises as we are at all time lows. Commodities will rise over the years but the killer is the debt, inflation, interest rates and tax. Rising dollar over that period will dampen crop prices in AUD.

We know commodities are cyclical too so who knows what the #nickel price will be by the time of assumed post-tax payback in roughly 2027/2028. Why fund that capex as an investor.

47 2018-06-25 21:55:31 The coming economic storm has nothing to do with the Fed.  Trump’s trade war will add 20-100% to the cost of raw materials, durable goods and commodities. DJT is about to inflict economic pain on the very people that elected him.

49 2018-06-25 21:52:18 In neoliberal societies people are commodities. They’re  ‘human resources’ at work, shuffled off into residential care when old, rather than respected as wise elders &turned into data at school, with danger of being ‘spat out’ if their ‘number’ is too low.

starting a hundred years ago. because that's when it all started to go horribly wrong.

at that time processed and branded foods were becoming a thing. but poor people did tend to buy commodities in bulk. and to some extent those commodities were produced more locally.
91 2018-06-25 18:13:26 Money as a medium of exchange facilitated the circulation of use-values as commodities. Money in this form is far from new & was not necessarily the new form of slavery. It is capital in the form of money that is the issue. Again it does not necessarily imply slavery.

93 2018-06-25 18:11:24 His definition of commodities as being products of labour leads to circularity, when he says that what is common to all of them is that they are fruits of labour.

95 2018-06-25 18:06:48 Isn't the extreme volatility a result of low liquidity?  A centralized "fed coin" is very likely imo, derived from the best emerging tech, possibly backed by commodities.
96 2018-06-25 18:03:35 During the depression, gluts of commodities led quickly to burying fields of unharvested crops, and burying calves in mass graves.   THIS is how supply and demand works.

That’s precisely what commodities like gold & silver do. They have a value but can’t be used for day to day commerce

128 2018-06-25 16:21:29 Lolz. Jayesh Shah ran a business that flopped. 80 crore turnover is peanuts in commodities! When a Biz is setup turnover non-existent so 80k in year 1 ok but EOD it was a loss making firm wound up..  Unlike Vadra who got loan to buy land, convert & sell back at a profit of 750%!!

232 2018-06-25 07:18:33 Raw sugar futures rose on Friday, boosted by signs of weaker monsoon rains in No. 2 grower India and spillover support from larger commodities, while the spot London cocoa contract's premium over September vaulted.

237 2018-06-25 06:42:36 Not necessary. Prices of various physical commodities (metals, crude etc) have been manipulated in recent history. These things are old.

240 2018-06-25 06:26:16 It's know it's stating the obvious to say that investors speculate in the housing market to make money, not to put a roof over anyone's head but their own. Why can't Gov accept that and take its due responsibility to see & build houses as homes & not speculative commodities
241 2018-06-25 06:21:11 Lies even if repeated again & again don't become truth. All Ethiopian export commodities (including coffee) exited through the port of Asseb, Eritrea. This was quoted by malicious / ignorant reporters then used by weyane to instigate hate against Eritrea. People bought the lies
242 2018-06-25 06:15:28 Analysis on perceived transactional value.

244 2018-06-25 06:07:35 I never used the words stock market. You must have implied that. All markets move in similar ways but crypto is 10x faster than traditional markets: stocks, futures, commodities, forex.
245 2018-06-25 06:04:33 Markets are globally dropping,readying for the collapse..Time to move into Cryptos and Commodities
246 2018-06-25 05:56:35 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
247 2018-06-25 05:50:20 Marketing of such commodities may be supposed to involve lesser uncertainty than does the marketing of investment goods, the demand for which depends on a number of complex decision-factors operating at different levels, public as well as private.
248 2018-06-25 05:48:29 Think water, property, mining rights, art, and precious metals+commodities. I also hear cement is always hot.

254 2018-06-25 05:03:28 Yeah. The alternate plan is to keep getting screwed on hydro and gas and commodities. Lets try to think more original. @fordnation is nothing like Trump. And even if he was a little, we could use a little Trump right now given the way our economy is.

258 2018-06-25 04:04:37 In my country India, there is huge scope of industrial expansion as well as service sector. Also, more people need more buildings, stuffs, food and other commodities. It directly leads to more domestic production. Means higher GDP growth. But still per capita income is lower.
259 2018-06-25 04:02:46 To impose this without an alternative for packaging , supply chain , and jobs seems like another whimsical move which will hit the smaller vendors in the short term , increase price of packaged commodities. I don’t if the govt has a plan other than enforcing the ban
260 2018-06-25 04:02:16 Still taking up irrelevant issues. Should observe black day for unemployment, high prices of commodities, farmers condition, kashmir issue etc
261 2018-06-25 03:49:40 ANY private room in a hospital has a tv, ac and a mini fridge, those are simple commodities. jiyong was put in a private room because it was adequate or  he and his colleagues wouldn’t get the rest they need. unfortunately there’s no priv room without those features. 
262 2018-06-25 03:46:42 There is no environmental damage here and more 5000 water bodies are getting desilted in this project which will increase the water levels and more the agro commodities from the villages will reach its right market in a real short time.
263 2018-06-25 03:41:11 True. Big prob w/ US corn/grain/bean etc crops is GMO or toxins we put on them. Commodities market whacked unless create 2nd category 4 each. Most Nations BAN GMOs/chems won't take them, even starving 3rd world. Check 4 tricks & test B4 unloading ships/send back at our expense

268 2018-06-25 02:56:04 David Lennox To BTVI: Expect Commodities To Take a Hit As Trade War Intensifies
269 2018-06-25 02:48:58 So what do the commodities do after they’re won? I’m wondering what the engine is, what the goal might be.
270 2018-06-25 02:45:25 Well didn't mean BROWN people! They believe @POTUS should go back to original constitution when POC were 3/5 of a person, & could trade them as commodities. @realdonaldtrump tired of all those amendments with civil rights in them, "burdensome" regulations on his 4th Reich plans.
271 2018-06-25 02:31:54 1) One reason I encourage people to question what’s being done with the land in Latin American when immigrants are displaced is, because in 2017 there was a rise in commodities, mainly metals, and mining activity in South America.
272 2018-06-25 02:31:15 I wish I had caught this poll sooner, but no, I'm not afraid to open up to my viewers. I may not share everything, but I feel that being more personable and opening up to them creates a good relationship. They are not commodities, they are people and I want to connect with them.
273 2018-06-25 02:27:13 you're missing the trees in the forest. I'd suggest working for a small bank is a feature, not a bug when you think about the political conflicts and turf wars with big banks. @Ole_S_Hansen doing great work on commodities at @saxobank .
274 2018-06-25 02:19:12 Empower yourself by being stronger than the capitalist urge to consume addictive commodities.
275 2018-06-25 02:09:21 When you state, “knows trading” it sounds like you want someone to pick a stock for you, and no one can legally do that without a license. Commodities have risk, and your advisor, which you should have had, should have made that very clear.

277 2018-06-25 01:56:40 the capitalist warmongers view poor people and soldiers as toys & commodities to be used up and thrown away
278 2018-06-25 01:54:55 Yes, manufacturing is an essential part of a balanced economy. Without it any downturn in commodities or housing is going to hurt a whole lot more!
279 2018-06-25 01:48:28 Even before the scars though when they had whatever value had been assigned to each S and P were they ever really viewed as more than commodities or objects? (yes, the scars do compound the commodifying)
280 2018-06-25 01:45:26 A5 Their scars go deeper to their sense of being female and being feminine. They have lost their value in their society and are now viewed as objects or commodities. It's heartbreaking. #THEBOOKCHAT

283 2018-06-25 01:30:43 Cost fuel and commodities is way up, so any tax savings has been eaten up by that, and then some.

287 2018-06-25 00:48:35 Sub Chapter *** Fiat Money

FYI: Money turned into a drug when the government chose to turn currency into fiat money.

People weren't so interested in money many moons ago, but commodities.

Now, worthless money is a commodity and so easy to miss evaluate and miss value.

291 2018-06-25 00:07:33 What are 'artificial' trade barriers and tariffs? How would you define trade reciprocity? Trade agreements are complex and require understanding of the unique aspects of commodities and internal markets in the trading nations. It is rarely a one-for-one scenario.
