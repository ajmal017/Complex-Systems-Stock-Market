1 2018-02-07 23:59:40 @tedlieu miss the memo? There is a pathway.
Question, since it's through " no fault of their own, " are ppl at fault going to be held acct?
2 2018-02-07 23:59:38 hate to break it to you and #Alberta. but BC and residents of the coast are opposed to allowing bitumen tar sands to the coast. The pipeline will not benefit British Columbians, only big oil and Albertans, and no jobs for BC will be created. #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli #NoPipelines
3 2018-02-07 23:59:36 Don't know how many cases will be won but we have many hurting families here in Alberta. The people protesting pipelines consume oil can you give me your definition of a hypocrite?
4 2018-02-07 23:59:31 You could have built several refiners, with Alberta oil, with jobs, sold it to , n lessoned environmental risks while we learned to adapt to clean energy. But instead u go for Total Risk to Environment, for bitumen to go to China. Way to go!!
5 2018-02-07 23:59:20 And meanwhile formerly protected lands are being opened to gas and oil drilling. Enough of going backwards!

7 2018-02-07 23:59:10 I grew up on the So. Cali Coast and remember all the little blobs of oil on my feet and shoes and how it destroyed the beautiful coast. It also was difficult to get off my shoes and feet. #nomoreoil4socali

12 2018-02-07 23:58:36 So - that’s a no?
13 2018-02-07 23:58:11 It's not oil, it's natural highlighter #perspective
14 2018-02-07 23:57:49 I went from I'm gonna take a quick nap then go get an oil change andgo to staples before work so I'm gonna keep taking this nap

39 2018-02-07 23:56:50 Nobody would give A SHIT about Venezuela if they didn't have lots of oil.
40 2018-02-07 23:56:46 Sure you know how to use internet.
41 2018-02-07 23:56:45 How about this. BC approves our oil and gas pipelines. In return we build a pipeline to transport #BCWine direct to #AB?
42 2018-02-07 23:56:44 peppermint oil man, rub a bit on the temples and breathe deep. Darkness and water too! Maybe you're going to evolve?
43 2018-02-07 23:56:38 We can still use the oil and develop alternative energy at the same time. The oil doesn't have to be used for automotive purposes.
44 2018-02-07 23:56:28 Bowser is actively dumping the oil from on top of a castle, forcing Mario to collect it in not one but two buckets
45 2018-02-07 23:56:27 BTW. I use cooking oil on the funnel to spin and open the end of  the heated end of plastic bottles ! PhanTom fanTom USA
46 2018-02-07 23:56:03 I’m a big fan of skin oil.
47 2018-02-07 23:55:55 I use the Garnier Sensitive Oil Miscellar water, and it works wonders! No reaction on my face whatsoever and makes your face feel really nice 
48 2018-02-07 23:55:37 When the oil be poppin
49 2018-02-07 23:55:35 I so agree as Saskatchewan also needs a way to gets it's oil to markets globally.  This isn't just àbout Alberta's oil resources.
50 2018-02-07 23:55:29 brick ramen noods with pork flavor packet,  broccoli, bell pepper,  lemon grass,  mushrooms and chile japones. And a drop of sesame oil and a dash of soy sauce.
51 2018-02-07 23:55:06 What kind of face oil do you use?
52 2018-02-07 23:54:52 love this. i had my own set of unit blocks (for my independent school) built by an amish carpenter near where i live. his daughter hand-finished them w linseed oil
53 2018-02-07 23:54:43 I wish consignment shops were as meticulous as I am. Just tried on a dress that looked great on me that I ended up putting back, because it had oil stains on it. Like I’ll buy a dress with a stain at the thrift store, but not for $30.
54 2018-02-07 23:54:37 You mean captain bone spur? I  can tell from a vets perspective he's a coward. Obamas thinking was that he didn't want us to die in a foreign country fighting for oil, that's real respect. Make no mistake Trump has no problem sending someone else's kid to die for his greed.
55 2018-02-07 23:54:36 Quavo & Carti are alright independently. I could be wrong, maybe they’ll pleasantly surprise us, which I doubt bc as of now I see them as water & oil. They just don’t mix.
56 2018-02-07 23:54:33 What is the process to get the oil and coal clean?
57 2018-02-07 23:54:18 Just reroute the thing away from towns, build a new terminal and away we go! I bet at least half of B.C. doesn’t know the existing line is there now. It’s win win, they think they won and the oil gets flowing!
58 2018-02-07 23:54:12 Oookkkaaaayyyy. No more weapons? No more oil?
59 2018-02-07 23:54:00 As much as I would love our Gulf leaders to trade oil in gold or switch currency to 1) Gold and if not to 2) Crypto, I and along with you can only but dream. Anyone who threatens the US$ is in trouble.
60 2018-02-07 23:53:46 I rub my entire body in a mix of body lotion or butter plus baby oil after every shower. Not gone catch me slipping in my nudes
61 2018-02-07 23:53:44 Finally getting this much needed oil change
62 2018-02-07 23:53:43 Plan on changing your own oil?
63 2018-02-07 23:53:27 AhhhhhI last time I checked drilling for offshore oil, which is one of the riskiest ways to acquire it, was about the only thing making money down on the East Coast. Remember fishing all the cod out??
64 2018-02-07 23:53:20 Just a fun game. A nice tempteture test also to see where people feel oil is going. #OPEC cuts pitched against  #shale #drillers is an interesting battle
65 2018-02-07 23:53:17 We had things going for us because then, Obama made a mess of things, esp finance and resources.. Houston is a big oil source. They also took care of themselves while getting help. Bush migrated Katrina victims to other states,  rebuilding was a long process for them as well.
66 2018-02-07 23:53:14 There are some people who are eagerly looking forward to it - Russians. It opens up the Arctic for oil and gas extraction (Exxon/Tillerson and Rosneft will be very happy), opens new shipping lanes, and massively increases the amount of arable land they have.

75 2018-02-07 23:52:09 cream .. it’s coacoa butter cream or i use olive oil .. i use them on any sores
76 2018-02-07 23:52:05 "Pop the popcorn on the stovetop in a mixture of the canola or corn oil and the flavored olive oil. There are youtube videos that can show you how."

Very few things have made me feel old the way this does.
77 2018-02-07 23:51:41 I just need a fork and a spoon and lots of oil 
78 2018-02-07 23:51:36 @NNPCgroup With a maximum crude oil production capacity of 2.5 million barrels per day, Nigeria ranks has Africa's largest producer of oil and the sixth largest oil producing country in the world..but Nigeria is constantly going through “fuel scarcity ” does it make sense??
79 2018-02-07 23:51:33 Exactly, He is what he has always been.
80 2018-02-07 23:51:30 Argan oil bagus bener
81 2018-02-07 23:51:27 Para investigar, porque me comentan que Ancap esta recibiendo gas oil en la plataforma petrolera, como forma de pago de la energía eólica vendida. Que ese combustible, seria para paliar la situción del sector agropecuario.

84 2018-02-07 23:50:57 Have you considered using a face oil at night? Hear me out! Skin overproduces oil when it’s stripped of it. A face oil at night would essentially trick the skin into producing less oil. Super moisturized skin at night and then your normal moisturizer for daytime!

90 2018-02-07 23:50:14 Somebody made an indirect comment to me that CA can develop alternative energy sources. That's fine but at the same time, if the oil can benefit CA, we should be able to take it.
91 2018-02-07 23:50:09 Chinacoin is coming. It fits your reasoning clearly.
What will Arabcoin be? Decentralised or “made in China”?
What are GCC sheikhs going to do about crypto?
Just follow coattails of Petrodollar? Or will they secure their oil wealth, through crypto?
92 2018-02-07 23:50:02 Also: We have the oil, and zero nukes. We have all the fresh water, and equal rights. I know it's uncouth, but we are standing on the moral high ground- and it's made of bargaining chips.
93 2018-02-07 23:49:55 Just saw that also. Mom mobile just needs some newness. Shoes(tires), brakes, oil, detailed. Upkeep crap.

95 2018-02-07 23:49:45 Bit of a hypocrite, is our @JustinTrudeau. He doesn't really listen to Canadians even when there is a consensus of 85-90%, for example on labeling #GMOs, not to mention the oil situation.
96 2018-02-07 23:49:40 Feed stock is the Crude that Chevron refinery uses to make fuel. It comes from northern BC and Alberta through kinder Morgan. If that stops, which is what I think we should do not wine that's stupid. Then you have to increase crude oil shipments into Burnaby by ship.
97 2018-02-07 23:49:33 I scheduled an oil change for 10:30 tomorrow morning and a massage for 11. Should be a very relaxing day

105 2018-02-07 23:48:46 I mean you’re kind of, like, literally a snake oil salesmen now, you know?
106 2018-02-07 23:48:45 @VsKing98  Do you guys say "Get the oil or get the lotion?"
107 2018-02-07 23:48:42 You are a dope . China drilling for their own oil . It a matter of national security . I say blockaid no gas goes into California ,25, ooo signatures in half hour
108 2018-02-07 23:48:31 Aman sih maybe, since its natural oil
109 2018-02-07 23:48:23 Be nice if you could have a dedicated 'palm oil free' selection. Make a stand Coop.
110 2018-02-07 23:48:12 Would you have done this had you known there was oil there since that’s all you really care about?
111 2018-02-07 23:48:08 i had to soak my nose piercing in sea salt for two weeks and then use tea tree oil bc i had a bump. it was awful.
112 2018-02-07 23:48:08 Cleaning up Obama's mess takes time and yes money.  Rebuilding the military will bring Peace Through Strength.  Did you know by 2019 will surpass Russia in Oil and Gas exports to other countrys?  This means Energy Dominance, not Energy Reliance.  Good things are happening.
113 2018-02-07 23:48:01 lavender essential oil by @doterra works great for soothing purposes. I slap that on my dog, cat, and girlfriend’s paws anytime they are being restless at night.
114 2018-02-07 23:47:53 Well its a small oil leak and the light wont go off  but ironically I normally keep my car spotless

119 2018-02-07 23:47:15 It's not about the oil...it's about the money to be made from the theft and sale of the oil.
120 2018-02-07 23:47:00 Lmao buy that massage oil called karma out of der 
121 2018-02-07 23:46:38 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?
122 2018-02-07 23:46:35 Currently waiting on my car to get an oil change and I’m STARVING, can they hurry 
123 2018-02-07 23:46:23 soo what's your option about oil being transported by rail?  it's worst than coal
124 2018-02-07 23:46:16 Ryan Strome career points per game average: .48ppg

What are you expecting?
125 2018-02-07 23:46:14 well played sir - tell potential invaders no oil here ;)
126 2018-02-07 23:46:10 SDF and Syrian Kurds in general are over extended. Sooner or later, regime will counter oil grab and control of water-related resources. Makes for clashes or potential compromise on some autonomy
127 2018-02-07 23:46:03 Yes it does added to the key factor which has been the downturn in the oil & gas sector. Oil prices are rising fast so the next 1/4 will show a vast improvement. The Scot Gov has also only recently been given the powers to boost it. What about the democratic wishes of Scotland ?
128 2018-02-07 23:45:45 That's redundant dummy,there's no such thing as clean oil or coal,recent studies show black lung disease is at its highest point ever,Trump helped them alright,helped kill the miners!

140 2018-02-07 23:44:32 If only Trump would do something that is awesome and good. Instead we get his health care debacle, a stupid wall not built, neglect of the environment, tax cuts that punish the blue states, proposed drilling for oil off the coasts, bad appointments, divisive rhetoric, etc.

Still I Rise
MAYA ANGELOU
You may write me down in history
With your bitter, twisted lies,
You may trod me in the very dirt
But still, like dust, I'll rise.

Does my sassiness upset you?
Why are you beset w gloom?
’Cause I walk like Ive got oil wells
Pumping in my living room
142 2018-02-07 23:44:22 We are addicted to oil, as a society which is poisoning our enviro. We need to stop using and get off it as soon as we can, or we will essentially O.D. Does that mean stop all oil use. No. But we need to transition off of oil sooner rather then later

158 2018-02-07 23:42:27 Yes, build a refinery here or Alb. and keep it in Canada. Raw resource exports are not in Our best interest. As per world using more oil, does that mean we should blindly follow as well? There’s an opioid crises currently that I see similarities.

179 2018-02-07 23:39:09 If Putin wanted Trump to win, why release damaging info on Trump? Russia gets large part of GDP from oil and gas. Why would Putin want a POTUS who would expand US oil and gas production?

182 2018-02-07 23:38:31 Aaron, the only reason we use fossil fuels is because they are needed to fight the wars over resources, including oil. If tanks ran on solar, there would be no need for war.
183 2018-02-07 23:38:30 Let's not forget "of the" repeated -- for extra affect, I presume?!

Nevermind collusion, obstruction or even conspiracy...

They can't even proofread effectively.

In the words of @realDonaldTrump -- "...like a well-oiled machine."

Maybe they are using KY instead of oil.

193 2018-02-07 23:37:34 No. The left wing doesn’t like the oil industry because we understand the dire consequences of not protecting the environment. No environment. No jobs. No environment. No human life on planet earth.  There are other energy alternatives. Diversify Alberta.

214 2018-02-07 23:34:06 The west coast is all concerned about spills and their coastline yet the east coast have tankers coming in non stop to feed oil to the east.

217 2018-02-07 23:33:55 I see FE is at -34. Does this mean that this fractal cycle is almost over? We still have a ways to go until the lower 50s/upper 40s. I have no problems if we get a new fractal cycle up, and that we move up and down on the way back to the glorious lows we know oil should be at.
218 2018-02-07 23:33:51 So I’m getting my oil change done and their computer system totally crashes and shout out to that because I just got a free oil change lol
219 2018-02-07 23:33:49 The smiling snake oil salesman who conned the people with smoke and mirrors. Sounds so cliche, yet it happened. Distract the public from the corruption going on around them by firing up 60's style social injustice movements, then go ahead & do whatever you want: lie, steal, etc.
220 2018-02-07 23:33:47 Wagner is definitely there and definitely takes part in economic matters.  This was allegedly an attack attempting to secure an oil field.  I wouldn't doubt it if a few Russians got fragged.
221 2018-02-07 23:33:41 They haven’t spent an entire club’s oil wealth on a footy club. That’s part of the magic trick everyone’s falling for, and it’s not the point anyway. We don’t need to spend even a fraction of our owner’s wealth to take the next step, yet they choose not to.
222 2018-02-07 23:33:34 Um, you lost me - no clue what feed stock has to do with oil tankers. No, an oil spill in the Vancouver harbour is obviously my problem and I don't like the risk, my point exactly. Still don't understand why protecting the ocean is anti-Alberta. And have fun with Trump!

263 2018-02-07 23:28:07 Simple take on the BC vs Alberta conflict. You spill #BCwine, you might ruin your carpet. You spill #Alberta oil and you’ll destroy an entire ecosystem that has existed for millions of years. #yvr #yyj #bcpoli
264 2018-02-07 23:27:49 Naw I'm saying I'm ready when you are.. baby oil or lotion ?
265 2018-02-07 23:27:47 The military is a form of corporate welfare. Have to keep the shipping lanes open and the oil flowing etc. that’s why they want more military spending and protect America’s interest. Which is $$$.
266 2018-02-07 23:27:43 LOL I made a whole grain rotini with an oil, dill, cajun powder, Ragu tomato sauce.
267 2018-02-07 23:27:41 What irks me is how 90% of BC residents are using the "holier than thou" approach. While I'm 100% w/ em in regards to environmental concerns. They seem to be intentionally ignorant that Alberta's oil & gas is a major reason why the Canadian dollar is as strong as it is.

269 2018-02-07 23:26:40 Put coconut oil in it after you wash your hair, it makes it look nice. Embraces the curls!!
270 2018-02-07 23:26:37 We are stuck with citizen criminals. No choice. 
We are not obligated to be stuck with criminal illegals. Solution simple, deport them.
271 2018-02-07 23:26:28 逃げないように拘束しておかないと
272 2018-02-07 23:26:14 Obviously solution is to stop all oil & gas from going into BC.  Then they can be as environmentally sensitive as they wish while they bike or walk to work, use fireplaces to cook over and heat their house.
273 2018-02-07 23:26:13 Don’t drink the oil! I’ve heard horrible things lol

275 2018-02-07 23:25:55 I don’t like #bcwine but boycotting it in favour of oil is stupid as shit.
276 2018-02-07 23:25:54 Fuck ton of grain. Also manufactured most consumer goods and industrial machines for other communist countries. Later Oil. A lot actually
277 2018-02-07 23:25:52 We completely understand your concern. We require that all palm oil sourced, is at minimum, verified by the RSPO standard. We also source most of it directly from trusted suppliers in South America who align with our values & serve as members of the Palm Oil Innovation Group.
278 2018-02-07 23:25:38 Isn't Canadian oil going to west coast port (and east) by rail?  Helluva lot riskier than pipe, I'd wager a bet!
279 2018-02-07 23:25:27 Transition to what? Go for it.  The world is using increased fossil fuels, not less.  You are simply displacing Canadian oil with some from a less ethical location.  And our social programs lose too.. go figure!

282 2018-02-07 23:24:52 Honestly is it worth it? Should I oil?
283 2018-02-07 23:24:49 You didn't hear it from me! I'm an Albertan I oppose the pipeline - or do you only care about Albertan oil lobbyists? 
284 2018-02-07 23:24:40 Ah well just get our fuel/oil from somewhere else. The pipeline wasn't always there.
285 2018-02-07 23:24:36 I mean I’m no oil painting myself but Jesus some of the losers I see half decent birds shack up with  I’m putting it down to sheer loneliness/horny for a bit cock
286 2018-02-07 23:24:25 Idk if it’s the placebo effect but I think bio oil might be helping my hyperpigmentation
287 2018-02-07 23:24:22 Thank God... It's not the power!!.. Ivan would have us in the rural communities sitting around the oil lamps #tonighttv3
288 2018-02-07 23:24:14 wow i really just almost accidentally drank out of the olive oil instead of my water. it made it all the way to my lips
289 2018-02-07 23:24:13 dry shampoo doesnt do shit in terms of making hair Feel less gross i rly dont understand maybe youre supposed to put like oil and stuff in your hair idk i dont do much hair care. maybe thats it
290 2018-02-07 23:24:09 Every single one of them. Not a bad apple in the bunch. Weighing benefits of illegals vs damage some do, just suck it up, it's worth it?
291 2018-02-07 23:24:02 Holy shit i got a cold sore  n have been using tea tree oil on it its almost gone omg. Its been like only 4 days too holy shit 10/10 would recommend.
292 2018-02-07 23:23:57 BC stopped Alberta from transporting oil through the mountains. Alberta's response? 

To boycott BC wine, because of course.
293 2018-02-07 23:23:54 If hobbits were real there would be foot-beard oil grooming kits for boy hobbits and 1,001 expensive  pedidepilation options for girl hobbits. #LOTR #distractedrewatching
294 2018-02-07 23:23:39 Vitamin E oil is great for your skin. It keeps it looking young and plump!
295 2018-02-07 23:23:30 I just got a essential oil diffuser/ humidifier that LIGHTS up and if you think I am leaving my room at all today you are sadly mistaken
296 2018-02-07 23:23:30 Honestly .. gunna see how this oil and leave in conditioner for 24hours before the wash does to my hair.
297 2018-02-07 23:23:27 Cannaboid oil leaned patriarchial but this topic is rife with it.
298 2018-02-07 23:23:26 I'm with you on the creams and potions! I have learned that a bottle of coconut oil can usually do the job of at least six things - but then there's the shampoo etc etc!
299 2018-02-07 23:23:15 I love how your side's only chance at having an argument is making the strawman argument that all of what Musk has done is put a car in space. Enjoy beating up a strawman to inflate your follower count! Maybe while you're at it you can denounce oil & energy monopolies?... :/

307 2018-02-07 23:22:11 Imagine if a Republican governor hired an oil lobbyist after making a big deal with big oil.... 

I guess Dems are ok with oil now that @NC_Governor is? 

#ncpol
308 2018-02-07 23:22:11 So they can import more foreign oil! Smart
309 2018-02-07 23:21:49 Our pristine coast is much more precious than Alberta oil.
310 2018-02-07 23:21:43 Llorente turns like an oil tanker.
311 2018-02-07 23:21:41 3/ world's largest Equity investor announced proposal to exit oil stocks

read them quickly and out loud and you're speaking Irish in no time
313 2018-02-07 23:21:11 That's better than my crude oil trade email.
314 2018-02-07 23:21:09 I can find no excuse other than to keep us dependent on oil. There are to many alternative ways to create energy cheaply without polluting our nation to waste any more money time or effort on oil other than cleaning uptarsands, digging up pipelines and capping wells.
315 2018-02-07 23:20:59 @Nolask_sentials if I have the iconic elixir and witches brew toner, do I need the cucumber mist and botanical oil?
316 2018-02-07 23:20:58 How to give a diesel a tuneup one gallon of vegetable oil and one quart of dextron mercon v transmission fluid in the gas tank then fill with fresh diesel fuel will see a deference
317 2018-02-07 23:20:50 After 2 cars that the engine died after going back to conventional oil after using synthetic for months is a hard and winter cold lesson learned so it WONT happen a 3rd time.
318 2018-02-07 23:20:50 So psyched I finally transitioned myself out of the illegal immigrant saturated landscaping industry into my now successful Cannabis CBD oil business. It's an exploding billion dollar industry.
319 2018-02-07 23:20:49 Tinder for guys is kinda like being a used car salesman. You’re trying to get the 89 Corolla with the oil leak that’s been sitting for a few months off your lot to the matches aka the customers. Except the Corolla is your dick and it leaks more than just oil.

322 2018-02-07 23:19:35 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。
323 2018-02-07 23:19:18 There will be lots of rooms for Albertans in Banff, Lake Louise, & Canmore cause 2 can play that game.  When the PM actually has his world class cleanup plan in place oil will move.  All Notley is doing is pissing people off.
324 2018-02-07 23:19:15 But buying 50 dollar a bbl oil now versus 150 bbl in 20 years maybe a steal...electric is the only way
325 2018-02-07 23:19:08 Moot or not... The grandstanding and politicking from idiots like @NicolaSturgeon on this issue is causing perpetual uncertainty in Scotland. A reason Scotlands economy is growing at half the rate of the UK. Oh, and oil wouldn’t have made a difference... plain and simple.

327 2018-02-07 23:19:02 Whole foods is the healthiest option for grabbing lunch near my work. I primarily use the food/salad bar. It's just disconcerting to see so many of the foods' ingredients tags listing canola oil, considering it's trans fat content.
328 2018-02-07 23:18:57 How to properly perform MER Testing on Gas Lifted Oil wells
329 2018-02-07 23:18:56 Yeah I know but that didn't happen right away. Maybe the gorilla tape in the front made more pressure. Or my oil change.
330 2018-02-07 23:18:34 Snake oil insult seems very popular all of a sudden. 
To my knowledge, it’s never been sold in the UK.
331 2018-02-07 23:18:31 i need at least one room in my future home for generic oil paintings that center black love
332 2018-02-07 23:18:27 Note to self every car over 100,000 miles cannot go backwards on its oil. Once they go synthetic they won't go back!
333 2018-02-07 23:18:24 Oh, i love the image of the turd; but it's trump and the pool's filled with coal & oil.
334 2018-02-07 23:18:16 Wow , bend for oil companies or you try to kill an industry...looks like you have enough whine in your province anyway. We kinda need to make sure our coastline isn't covered in oil and dead... #bcwineboycott
335 2018-02-07 23:18:11 I got a rose essential oil I am so happy 
336 2018-02-07 23:18:09 When I get oil changes I do not drink the complimentary coffee.   
337 2018-02-07 23:17:45 The Guardlenin is a leftist rag I wouldn't put under my car to change the oil.  Pay it no heed - nobody with an ounce of sense should, and your sense is measured in kilotonnes.
338 2018-02-07 23:17:41 You're Lucky,every childhood in France since the dawn of time is about a green Mouse that's soaked in oil, in water and turns into a snail 
339 2018-02-07 23:17:40 We will see. 

Frankly I think if push comes to shove we'll  start importing from the USA, their gas is cheaper.

But we have enough stored away and we are coastal so we can get gas/oil/wine/beer/fruit from anyone we want.

That's why the ban is really funny.
340 2018-02-07 23:17:16 This issue was about the BC Government wanting to study the effects of the product that a Texas oil company wanted to ship through our watersheds and coast. Notley doesn't want the Province to do the study...so she boycotted BC wine from Alberta.
341 2018-02-07 23:17:13 Bacon grease is my essential oil.
342 2018-02-07 23:17:12 I hope the coconut oil will untangle my hair, because when I comb my hair it gets very tangled and it hurts
343 2018-02-07 23:17:07 So all we want is for our owners to blow their personal wealth on making LFC compete with Man City for a few years. That sounds realistic. (It’s easier when you can spend an entire country’s oil wealth on your footie clubs.)

345 2018-02-07 23:17:00 Cashews are in the same plant family as poison ivy & poison sumac & their itchy oil is contained almost entirely in the shell of the nut, that’s why you always find cashews sold naked! They also help manage diabetes with blood sugar absorption by muscle cells! #WednesdayWisdom

347 2018-02-07 23:16:39 Russia GDP is oil/gas & they need money. Might have behaved better if Arctic oil contract leveraged.

351 2018-02-07 23:16:22 So I made tacos last night and as the oil popped on my chest I thought “How can 2 natural resources be so damn destructive” !????

353 2018-02-07 23:16:19 feels really sad about all the canolas that had to die to make this oil
354 2018-02-07 23:16:04 Russia will flourish since it will have more arable land and Arctic shelf will be opened to oil exploration. Most of the USA, not so much.
355 2018-02-07 23:15:52 If Aetna is looking for a snake oil salesman, who thinks very highly of himself, then Immelt is their man. Just let me know so I can drop their stock before it loses 40% of it's value, and the company loses its credibility.
356 2018-02-07 23:15:33 There is no trade war. Alberta gas/oil/ bitumen/whatever still flows through the existing KM pipeline & is loaded onto tankers for export. The pipeline is still being built. @RachelNotley is over-reacting & trying to bully BC. I’m glad @jjhorgan is standing up for BC. #bcpoli
357 2018-02-07 23:15:01 Got my tea tree oil now I need my mango butter.
358 2018-02-07 23:14:55 No, I never used it before. I heard that they are good for nails but I never decided to try them. I only use cuticle oil ;w;
359 2018-02-07 23:14:51 It was a great evening!  Delicious vegan cheese and olive oil 
360 2018-02-07 23:14:45 That's a common formula for a tax, but not cap-and-invest. #CleanEnergyJobs program is more flexible than a tax. There's no way to calculate how individual oil companies will comply or how much clean energy will bring down the price. Gas prices in Ontario, Quebec and CA are down.
361 2018-02-07 23:14:41 Hi Rachel, as a BC voter, I’m strongly opposed to you punishing small BC business on behalf of a Texas Oil giant. Thanks, Jordan - Vancouver BC. #cdnpoli #bcpoli
362 2018-02-07 23:14:37 While indeed true, Manning was the face of the Colts. They call Lucas Oil “The House that Peyton Built.” He got let go because his injury was thought to be horrendous and unrecoverable. Once again, it was a rivalry of the two teams at the time. Don’t apply retroactive 20/20
363 2018-02-07 23:14:35 Gov't subsidies like tax breaks & environmental credits are not the same as his company being funded by taxpayer money. Are you equally concerned abt  subsidies in other areas like the oil industry? Boeing gets 13.4 million in subsidies, are you criticizing Dennis Muilenburg?
364 2018-02-07 23:14:27 Doesn't make me feel tired at all. It has however taken away all my pain and I danced today for three hours...  just days ago I could hardly sit or walk without cronic pain. Within an hour of taking the oil yesterday I was pain free.
365 2018-02-07 23:13:35 I’m so annoyed with how long this oil change took

371 2018-02-07 23:12:29 Coconut oil clogs your pores!!! Stop using it as make up remover!
372 2018-02-07 23:12:21 There’s 14/15 year old girls posting shit like “HOW I LOST WEIGHT AND GOT CURVY- a thread”

Bitch you literally just went through puberty that’s it. Coconut oil and self care had nothing to do with it lmao
373 2018-02-07 23:12:17 So I'm guessing you think added tolls or a surcharge on oil to the coast is too excessive a move at this point ?
374 2018-02-07 23:12:17 Dear Chicago residents dont be fooled by this man Canada is fighting for real action on climate change, tax havens, pipelines, offshore oil drilling, proportional representation, hes no leader and hes not fighting the 1%

386 2018-02-07 23:10:41 Honestly my mom is the best. I have the flu and i was asleep when she got home last night and she set up essential oil vapors in my room and massaged my feet. I love her.
387 2018-02-07 23:10:37 Getting an oil change at Valvoline, and the dude is "recommending" all this shit to get replaced, and that they do it the "cheapest" here. Halfway through his speech, I'm just like, "Yeah, my mom is the District Manager for Auto Zone, so I know prices." He stopped talking 
388 2018-02-07 23:10:37 Kinda hard to talk when the BC Govt isn't willing to come to the table & just blindly rejects anything to do with oil. Notley seems willing to talk/compromise. But interprovincial trade requires both sides to participate.
389 2018-02-07 23:10:31 I use so much tea tree oil
390 2018-02-07 23:10:29 エクストラバージンオイルってなんか卑猥だよね。
391 2018-02-07 23:10:25 I'm sure the EU would have happily evicted an Independent Scotland from the EU even although it would be evicting the largest oil producer in the EU as spite for us daring to leave the UK. It's moot now anyway

400 2018-02-07 23:08:23 I am sure Putin wanted USA to win in Syria, or increase USA oil production to lower cost of oil, or for USA to supply natural gas to Europe.
401 2018-02-07 23:08:13 Unless these suits use a different kind of vinyl than what inflatables are made of, it must be a care or storage issue. Pooltoys routinely last longer than that with no ill effects. Skin oil does damage vinyl over time!
402 2018-02-07 23:08:13 Salad I made! Red pepper, mixed greens, apple, carrots, red onions with balsamic, olive oil, lemon juice, and Dijon mustard (mixed) as dressing
403 2018-02-07 23:08:13 @Condog360 surprised one isn't called olive oil
404 2018-02-07 23:07:57 Erin - do you know that @pepsi @PepsiCo is one of the WORST environmental offenders in pursuit of profit? Their use of #palm oil is destroying forest, orangutans and more. Not cute to buy their disgusting products. Educate yourself.

407 2018-02-07 23:07:47 I have oil change anxiety.
408 2018-02-07 23:07:44 Okay idk why I have never done a coconut oil hair mask before yesterday pero my life is CHANGED. #thebest
409 2018-02-07 23:07:44 You should be able to get it done cheaper than that! I get mine changed for only $100 down here. Definitely shop around or go to like oil can Henry’s.
410 2018-02-07 23:07:39 @EPAScottPruitt I am a paid lobbyist who is here to poison americans and let severe weather destroy cities and towns so I scott pruitt the failed banker can continue to steal the very money meant for this sort of thing while being a whore to oil/gas/chemical companies.
411 2018-02-07 23:07:28 This is an Alberta Bot Account , how desperate to fake support. I think it's on loan from Trump and Putin. 
Btw: we will use oil and it products with or without that pipeline.  So weak computer generated argument.

415 2018-02-07 23:06:39 There is applesauce instead of oil/margarine/butter. I generally insist on 1/2 sugar to cut the horrible taste of the the truvia.
416 2018-02-07 23:06:33 Our military is different from the military that fought for freedom. Now we fight for oil.
417 2018-02-07 23:06:33 But think of all the oil in Siberi- I mean all the new beachfront properties he could parcel out from federal lands.
418 2018-02-07 23:06:30 Kerrie how can you ever think you're not good enough? You are one of the sexiest, most beautiful babe channels girls I've ever clapped eyes on and when you throw in oil onto it, wow. You also have an amazing, bubbly personality. Pains me that you can't see what everyone else can.
419 2018-02-07 23:06:10 This is what we’ve all been expecting -sort of. Last year my worry was: if we bar Alberta from travelling through BC to deliver their oil to its final destination, then what stops them from barring our lumber crossing Alberta to our various destinations? Never thought about wine~

423 2018-02-07 23:05:26 Serious answer, Canada has the 2nd largest oil reserves in the world with a small population and a massive green space acting as a CO2 sink. That's why.
424 2018-02-07 23:05:17 Alberta the wild in Canada's West thinking they have might over will when the only army they have is one armed with pipes filled with oil. True they did make Wall look small which caused me to ROFL but B.C. is a different breed when it comes to the might of their people.

426 2018-02-07 23:05:13 Had @PatMcCroryNC hired an oil lobbyist 4 days after approving a pipeline deal with a slush fund for himself, the number of heads exploding among #NCpol media & Democrats' would create rivers of blood, brains and gore in the streets of Raleigh.

#NCGA
427 2018-02-07 23:05:00 When Canadians reject new pipeline projects, they are opposing oilfield production increases because of climate change, pipeline spills and offshore catastrophes. The people are demanding the end of the oil economy and want a change to a renewable energy future. #ActOnClimate
428 2018-02-07 23:04:59 Didn’t know if the ingrained racism was as bad as ours in Australia (though of course know some of the history thanks to Midnight Oil). England too cold and too crazy atm. Fit in best in Eastern Europe, but that’s also cold and nazi-ish these days.

434 2018-02-07 23:03:58 Germans and refugees need to see the big picture, long term plan. both are being manipulated. Putin has long had intentions to open bases in Syria, secure oil pipelines on eastern border, have easy Black Sea access. Its why he invaded Ukraine, grabbed Crimea, is puppeting Assad.

440 2018-02-07 23:03:04 Compromise being the key here as politics are just that. With some tweaking alberta could still get their oil to market. The sticking points to me are that it’s bitumen and trying to bring it through Juan da Fuca strait.

490 2018-02-07 22:57:56 The chemical is a silicone that is used when cooking the fries to keep the oil from frothing. Should fry eaters be concerned? And does the silicone also keep the eater from frothing at the mouth due to consuming fries?

492 2018-02-07 22:57:41 No way, our Burrard Inlet will never be the same. Hundreds of ships in and out under Lions Gate and Second Narrows bridges where there is danger of hitting them and spilling the oil in our waters. So, who cares? We do. We live here.
493 2018-02-07 22:57:34 Well, creatine won't address overall health. To help circadian rhythm, don't look at bright things when the sun is down, especially TVs, computer monitors, and phones.

495 2018-02-07 22:57:19 Yes because it's in BC. If you read the article its an update in equipment to be able to see how oil spills can happen and how they may spread. The people who cleaned Heiltsuk area claimed they had great spill response but they didn't.
496 2018-02-07 22:57:17 Oregon and Washington states need to do the same as California then the Administration would have to ship the oil through Canada or Mexico.

511 2018-02-07 22:55:50 Oil sands have less emissions than California oil. Why isn't anyone protesting their oil? 

This whole thing is hypocritical. The only oil protested is Canada's.

513 2018-02-07 22:55:39 So, lemme get this straight.... we should reduce our GHG emissions by shipping oil via rail or transport truck instead of a pipeline? Holy hell.... you suck at math.
514 2018-02-07 22:55:33 Considering Horgan's fears of a "catastrophic oil spill" - & considering there already is a pipeline, what will the Premier do about his fears regardless of twinning?  #bcpoli #cdnmedia

516 2018-02-07 22:55:24 However, the big oil companies would fight it and they have the big hammer, ownership of our oil. Time to legislate them all out of our country. It’s our resource we should own it.

526 2018-02-07 22:54:15 True but the per capita emissions for Saudi Arabia is less than 20 tonnes per capita and they produce 2x the oil that Alberta does. High emissions are due to oil sands which have an extremely high energy usage per barrel.
527 2018-02-07 22:54:12 You must be outcha mind  full of that oil? 
528 2018-02-07 22:54:09 I’m starting you a gofundme. No sentient being deserves to be dipped in McDonald’s oil, figuratively or metaphorically
529 2018-02-07 22:54:04 I think someone snuck into my house and smeared Olive Oil all over my glasses while I was snow blowing - what the hell was I doing earlier
530 2018-02-07 22:53:44 Luna oil is a retinol, so i use it every other day. i use the other oils every night and lighter layers of them during day.
531 2018-02-07 22:53:39 Okay well the essential things I missed most - my LXMI creme (cc @alicek ) my hylauronic from NIOD, and this am, my Korres rose oil (I have super dry travel skin!!!) and drunk elephant vitamin C serum
532 2018-02-07 22:53:31 When the windshield sticker must've fallen off and you can't remember the last oil change in the car, and then get in the car and the dashboard reminder pops up. Thanks #Ford
533 2018-02-07 22:53:21 There ya go. Trying to get Trump to understand facts. He’s nothing more than a good old fashioned snake oil salesman. He’s decided he’ll take advantage of the power for his personal gain while he’s President and then he’ll leave his mess for someone else. Us.

535 2018-02-07 22:53:05 *snort* There's another one which blames the oil price fall on the US pressuring KSA, which I've heard from these people. They also sound a little like Trump and/or some of the less facts-attached Brexiteers.
536 2018-02-07 22:52:57 These names sold so much debt and equity to finance rampant production, they are all mainly zombie companies.  Buy the debt if you must, but avoid the shares.
537 2018-02-07 22:52:53 Mine has got to be 5 then  it’s so sad at one point I was putting coconut oil on my hairline after wudhu every time so it grows back x
538 2018-02-07 22:52:52 sadly oil paint take 100 years to dry but when they are done I'll definitely send you them :)
539 2018-02-07 22:52:46 OoOh sounds delicious! Can you bring some back to HQ? :) Just had my own "home brew" long black over ice with MCT oil 
540 2018-02-07 22:52:35 Then they should not use any off shore oil from any state
541 2018-02-07 22:52:19 Don't forget Mick Mulvaney, who is destroying the CPFB as we speak, and Rick Perry, who may as well be a lobbyist for Big Oil.
542 2018-02-07 22:52:11 Big oil and gas getting richer at the expense of our environment and clean air/water! Thank you, GOP, Trump and Tillerson! You've not only screwed us, you've screwed our kids and grandkids!
543 2018-02-07 22:51:59 I need an oil change and I think it’s the full size spare is low. She was more dash angry before I added wiper fluid
544 2018-02-07 22:51:51 @ Kenzie I agree , also hot oil is a close runner up 
545 2018-02-07 22:51:50 i didn’t use rose hip oil for a couple days & now my skin hates me & is all dried

The area is from Midland, N. to #LittlefieldCounty
548 2018-02-07 22:51:45 Y’know, there hasn’t been a major oil spill recently, or at least around these parts

553 2018-02-07 22:51:24 It’s not bad for them to have oils in them like that. It can be good for your skin to have oils like coconut oil in them. Plus they help make your face more hydrated. Not a bad thing
554 2018-02-07 22:51:13 maybe its good for you sebab one utk remove dirt , one more utk remove oil . muka lagi bersih . who knows .
555 2018-02-07 22:51:06 BC action to attempt to stop Alberta oil from reaching a port threatens thousands of jobs of the people of Alberta.

557 2018-02-07 22:50:50 Anytime, dear. Anytime. *smiles softly into his direction* Only a few more times and you'll be able to get your favorite oil drinks again. You know what the first thing will be when we're near the City after so long? Searching for a very nice bar.
558 2018-02-07 22:50:46 Correlation is not causation. Stating oil drives the entire market is essentially one regression too far.

More likely that risk parity and volatility shorting are driving it. Surely you read the piece by Artemis.

562 2018-02-07 22:50:22 fact is. BC doesn't want a pipeline through BC or dirty tar sands on the coast. We also don't want a repeat of  #ExxonValdez oil spill on the coast either. #Alberta has no righht to force tar sands on us, #BC Premier is doing the right thing. #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli

That's why come rain come sunshine 
Nothing like restructuring
565 2018-02-07 22:49:33 Hi, some of the samples we suggest to businesses are these ones. Biodegradable, flexible & single use. This pack of 200 cost us £1.99. These & paper are what we’d like to see replace oil based plastic ones in supermarkets if deemed suitable for people who require straws.

567 2018-02-07 22:48:56 Facts: Oil will only be a critical economy for how many more years? Why all this focus on a pipeline instead of on batteries and tech?
568 2018-02-07 22:48:53 Every time I smoke oil I just want flower smh
569 2018-02-07 22:48:42 If Alberta and Saskatchewan stop producing oil and food, their per capita emissions would be similar to everyone else.
570 2018-02-07 22:48:39 Do I remember correctly that  Ms Notley got her back waaaay up over ElizabethMay’s (outrageous) suggestion that Alberta refine it’s own oil?  Well Rachel if you can’t listen to reasonable ideas & miss economic opportunities as a result don’t trash BC for your failures.
571 2018-02-07 22:48:18 it feels like she's trying to evolve into like a hyper-classy, old school oil money Chrissy Teigen and i'm so here for it
572 2018-02-07 22:48:08 One of my customers made me try their new product that has CBD oil in it. I was like alright let’s get it 
573 2018-02-07 22:48:06 Oil prices fell to a one-month low on Wednesday after U.S. data showed a build in inventories and record high crude production, raising worries of more selling that could expose speculators with big bets on upward momentum in crude prices.

577 2018-02-07 22:46:56 There’s a reason oil and water don’t mix :(
578 2018-02-07 22:46:53 I’m draft-era Army. Kinda hard to protect this country when all our military ran off overseas to fight for oil or dictator of the week, isn’t it
579 2018-02-07 22:46:49 The rate of ATM disappointments in the oil city #Warri is fast becoming unbearable,I think The DTHA should ve a say on this issue.
580 2018-02-07 22:46:48 Pretty sure my face broke out even more just sitting in line to get my oil changed

584 2018-02-07 22:46:21 I've been biting my nails down to nubs for over 30 years (toe nails got ripped off too). Nail oil is supposed to be good too, rubbed into cuticles.
585 2018-02-07 22:46:06 That's my impression, mainly because CA oil is such thick glop. But I don't claim to be an expert on this.
586 2018-02-07 22:46:03 Aquaphor and Vitamin E oil!! I know the struggle I’ve had this problem for so long 
587 2018-02-07 22:45:58 Obama through all his smooth talking ended up being a snake oil salesman. Trump, though crass and blunt, at least is pro-America.
588 2018-02-07 22:45:57 I’m getting an oil change and when the guy said “would you like to rotate your tires also?” I said “well I have frozen peas in the car so not today

591 2018-02-07 22:45:42 And that 0.7% is paid by oil companies.
592 2018-02-07 22:45:34 A friend of mine posted on FB asking if anyone uses your coconut/avocado oil blend. If so, did they also experience a plastic smell after cooking w/ it? Is this normal or did she get a bad batch. No odor in the bottle only when cooking w/ it.
593 2018-02-07 22:45:20 Anyone from Canada want a free oil change coupon near REGINA, Saskatchewan? Find me on Facebook for details or message me here.

595 2018-02-07 22:45:06 "don't you realize oil is in everything?" Is such a dumb argument. That is PRECISELY why it is dangerous. You won't condone a drug addict to continue being addicted, so why so complacent in oil addiction, especially since it kills the planet? Why shouldnt we invest in renewables?
596 2018-02-07 22:44:51 Grasping at disappearing jobs. BC is protecting millions of tourism and fisheries jobs that will last much longer than a few thousand temporary oil sands jobs.

Unless "THEIR" oil means "All of Nigeria and all Nigerians".
Anything less will not do.
617 2018-02-07 22:41:59 You see the whole of the economy ran on oil but Europe is running out except for giant oil deposits off the coast of Israel.  My Capri ran for 35 years and over 200,000 miles before I laid her to rest. Made in 81 the only thing that failed was the Ralph Nader paint job.
618 2018-02-07 22:41:59 I joined because I was a stupid kid wanted out of town and a job. The military is not a job machine - it is about killing and dying. It is NOT for running off overseas to fight for oil while Nazis are shooting up our people!

636 2018-02-07 22:40:06 Interesting and simplistic.  

For an independent analysis kindly Supply the exchange rates, crude oil prices and the dates these GHS 14 & GHS 22 occurred.
637 2018-02-07 22:40:01 @RepMarkTakano On Friday, the President opened 2 million acres of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante to dangerous mining and oil & gas extraction. Congress can’t tolerate this. Please support H.R. 4518 to immediately overturn it. Public lands must be protected!
638 2018-02-07 22:39:48 Of course you go to the extreme. Why can’t you wrap ur head around the fact that oil doesn’t have to be the ONLY source? What’s wrong with progression to renewables?
639 2018-02-07 22:39:22 That actually is the cul de sac the government has found itself in. 
At inception, due to low oil prices, it conveniently ended subsidy and ‘deregulated’. 
Today oil prices have almost tripled coupled  with a worsened exchange rate, Government is left with only two

641 2018-02-07 22:39:01 My grandfather, who was a geologist and worked for Shell in the middle east and Alberta looking for oil, testified in US Senate about oilsands. He left feeling the Americans viewed us as a strategic reserve to be used after mid east goes dry.

649 2018-02-07 22:38:18 The timeline suggests oil companies will be compelled to apologize in 2077.
650 2018-02-07 22:38:17 Cars were much simpler to operate and repair with a few simple tools pre catalytic converter and men created the standard engine to last long with a little regular maintenance. Men also designed engines with mileage exceeding the electric engine but the industry & oil stopped it.
651 2018-02-07 22:38:15 Yes, a useful bottom six player with the potential to get hot from time to time. Oilers have done him no favours by playing him everywhere in the lineup and with almost everybody on the roster.

653 2018-02-07 22:37:54 Not to mention oil and gas concerns are the lifeline of districts like his and Will Hurd's. Data without the context to interpret it is just numbers on a page.
654 2018-02-07 22:37:54 Doesn't seem necessary for these companies to need Section 45Q Tax Credits if they claim to be so profitable to its shareholders. How about we make economy competitive by ending subsidies for oil and gas?!?! #Stop45Q

663 2018-02-07 22:36:53 Yes, but if they were attracted to snake oil, maybe they weren't the right fit for Ducks...
664 2018-02-07 22:36:42 Now @SenTedCruz says he's a man defending union jobs. He is totally deflecting from @BNorthey nomination and making it all about saving jobs in the oil industry.
665 2018-02-07 22:36:37 Simply put BITUMEN will sink in the event of a spill. Oil is bad but can mostly b cleaned up .WE HOPE
666 2018-02-07 22:36:29 I cook with coconut oil only or I bake
667 2018-02-07 22:36:14 Either way the answer is coconut oil
668 2018-02-07 22:36:13 So oil companies get more zeros in a ledger somewhere, AB gets its 1% cut, and BC gets a polluted coastline. Wot a deal for BC!! #cdnpoli
669 2018-02-07 22:36:03 They already are. We've had about a dozen multi-national oil companies leave already.
670 2018-02-07 22:36:03 Bruh they played you hard  never pay $150 for a oil change
671 2018-02-07 22:35:58 just dont take the oil(s) near water and it cant spill in the fuckin water.
672 2018-02-07 22:35:56 @brakes_plus how much is convetial oil change cost
673 2018-02-07 22:35:47 Oh and you also cite Syria Campaign - funded by Ayman Asfari, check him out. UK resident, Syrian oil magnate wth political ambitions in #Syria, finances Tory party, under investigation fm Serious Fraud Office, sanctioned in Italy. PR agency 4 #WhiteHelmets. Bias?
674 2018-02-07 22:35:30 FACT: Israel is so far ahead of Canada and the USA on research hence why it's all being done there. Glad you're not my Dr. you sound like a pharma pusher. Good luck with that! The Truth is Google Cannabis Oil Extract Bottles from 1850 you'll get 9pgs. You need a new profession!
675 2018-02-07 22:35:22 Ameeen! Munyi maganinsu
676 2018-02-07 22:35:19 We are still the largest importer of foreign oil in the world. Jobless claims are low but not nearly the lowest - you have to factor in those who have stopped looking for work - it's more like it was 4-5 years ago, but definitely not the lowest.  Do your research!!!
677 2018-02-07 22:35:13 I don't necessarily look for ingredients because not everything works for my curls BUT: I use leave in conditioners as like a "pre curl" followed by miss Jessie's: pillow soft curls - eco styler (the green jar) & actual olive oil for shine lol
678 2018-02-07 22:34:49 @mlofgran And at what price would you deem it prudent to hedge? The Permian Basin is awash with oil and maybe it needs a local version of OPEC?!
679 2018-02-07 22:34:25 I’m taking in the #propel2018 Energy Conference @propel2018. Did you know that Alberta has the world’s largest lithium supply? It’s in the water in the conventional #oil fields.
680 2018-02-07 22:34:06 The quality of life in the US is going down hill do to Trump’s use of fossil fuel and drilling for oil in our oceans that our dying. No agencies to measure impact on our health. 
Overpopulation is an issue. Another reason abortions shouldn’t be thought as a crime against women.
681 2018-02-07 22:33:57 Alberta Premier Lougheed cut of oil to East at huge cost to his govt cuz of PM Trudeau's NEP. They both became legends! #cdnpoli #ableg
682 2018-02-07 22:33:56 it’s too bad Alberta can’t turn off the gas and oil tap. Now that would be something to see.
683 2018-02-07 22:33:53 Alberta has been used as a bargaining chip. Keep the oil in ground, and use it in trust for foreign Interest, as an investment. Good point- our rail infrastructure is sorely outdated. When God closes a pipeline, He opens a rail station.
684 2018-02-07 22:33:25 @convergXcon   Its been an amazing first day of discussions between defence and oil & gas. Over 340 B2B meetings happening.  If youre not here you are missing out! #convergx18
685 2018-02-07 22:32:48 I get literally the most expensive oil they offer and mine is 78$ MAXIMUM and they top off all of my tire and other fluid. That man is trying to rob you.
686 2018-02-07 22:32:44 Did someone mention Snake Oil salesmen?
687 2018-02-07 22:32:43 NEED NO MORE OIL..WE HAVE BATTERIES AND SOLAR LPOWER..BUT THE BILLIPONAIRS NEVER HAVE ENOUGH. IT'S ABOUT MORE MONEY WHICH THE BACKERS DO NM O T NEED...CHILDISH AND STUPID!!!

694 2018-02-07 22:31:46 You may have heard that the Trump administration is proposing a massive expansion of offshore oil drilling, potentially opening 90% of our country's outer continental shelf to oil exploration.
695 2018-02-07 22:31:41 States, especially those with long coastlines and philosophically agreeable neighbors, have many tools that might be effectively used to halt off-shore oil drilling. 
As Floridian, can share a few ideas

1. People who are Albertan first
2. People who are BC first and not opposed to a pipeline (which is pretty much the majority of us our beef is with Ottawa and Trudeaus awful policy not Albertan oil)

703 2018-02-07 22:30:46 Does divestment from oil company stocks lower future demand for their stock, and does it ultimately create a situation where oil company insiders (and like minded individuals) end up trading with themselves?

713 2018-02-07 22:29:32 What the hell is clean oil & coal? That makes about as much sense as dry water.
714 2018-02-07 22:29:26 This Hoosier hasn’t seen any benefit.  You’re a charlatan, just peddling the latest snake oil.  How about you address DACA, Russian interference, a stupid military parade or a bevy of other issues facing the country.
715 2018-02-07 22:29:24 Ffs, if a restaurant is going to fry poppadoms in the same oil as prawns, they should really have a warning listed on the menu.

717 2018-02-07 22:29:22 In your opinion, what makes someone an essential oil expert?
718 2018-02-07 22:29:12 There's been a huge imbalance on the evaluation of Strome. He tends to be undervalued by those that can't separate him from what he cost to get and overvalued by those trying to cling to anything.
719 2018-02-07 22:29:04 When Nigeria was amalgamated, we hard no oil.
Everybody was working and EVERYBODY got sumthing from his hand work.
We should not 4get the day with out oil.

724 2018-02-07 22:28:03 It's easily the worst, I always pretend it isn't there. Final straw was when they copied the "gold" death but swapped it for oil. Seriously, what was the point
725 2018-02-07 22:27:57 And as for pipelines harming the planet, transporting oil by train (see Quebec) or by transport truck only compounds dangers as well as GH gas emissions.
726 2018-02-07 22:27:43 almost like an oil slick 
727 2018-02-07 22:27:24 No drilling oil off coast lines. You will ruin fishing and tourism! Stop how much do we need!

774 2018-02-07 22:20:37 The world is glutted with oil. In the past it was believed that we would run out of oil in the not so distant future. However new technology in oil exploration has shown that the world has perhaps more oil than we'll ever need.

799 2018-02-07 22:17:39 If the world doesn't buy oil from Canada they will simply buy it somewhere else and Canadians will suffer. Curtailing our supply does nothing for a demand side issue. #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli

801 2018-02-07 22:17:21 If it's not a gas pipeline (oil, petroleum products, etc.), FERC doesn't have jurisdiction over construction. That would fall to states and federal agencies like the Army Corps for water permits: see Dakota Access.

806 2018-02-07 22:16:41 I had this issue when I was young. My first school was predominantly white - I was the only black girl. I’d be teased about the oil spray I had in my hair or the fact it wasn’t washed every day. Tell that young lady she is amazing & she should be forever proud of who she is x

810 2018-02-07 22:16:27 Back in my time they did, even  how to change  tire n change  oil in car. It's unfortunate  they don't  even  teach cursive  anymore  so you can sign  papers  in your style
811 2018-02-07 22:16:19 My car has said oil change and tire maintenance for awhile I should probably get that done 
812 2018-02-07 22:16:19 You're a very pretty girl. Maybe your ruffly, sticky-up fur is just residual cracks from the oil paint?
813 2018-02-07 22:16:12 @PnPCBC Pipline has been existence 50 years. Dilbit has been shipped for less than 20. Also rember oil tankers 50 years ago were half the size of the vessels used today

815 2018-02-07 22:15:56 just finished making a parting gift for work colleague - she mentioned having problems sleeping, so i made her a sleep sachet! mum helped sew the actual sac, and i mixed the herbs & some cotton balls w lavender&lemon essential oil. hope it helps her, or at least smells nice

837 2018-02-07 22:12:52 A bit overstated regarding @Nigel_Farage . Did you not see Gus O'Donnell on Peston talking about snake oil, astonishingly not realising everyone saw he is the snake oil salesman, par excellence. And his fellow Quislings are no better.
838 2018-02-07 22:12:42 But I see this as hypocritical. There are many mining, oil, natural gas, and agricultural companies that inject their companies and interests into State-v-Federal land issues, and on a MUCH larger scale. Why not take issue with these companies and focus your energy there?

843 2018-02-07 22:12:16 I find that 90% of the people that have stickers like that or flex for the gram about how hard they worked on their vehicle are the same ones that literally only change their oil and take it to a shop for anything else

846 2018-02-07 22:12:06 Keep in mind that current world price for oil is below $70/bbl & “Western Canada Select” aka #tarsands crude sells at significant discount (requires special refining) so break even doesn’t come in until ~$100/bbl + shipping costs.

891 2018-02-07 22:07:31 Completely wrong! I work in the industry and have done since 2000, there is more profit per barrel of oil than there ever was at $100. BP pull it out of the UKCS for circa $16pb with the NSea average sub $30 with a drive to hit $23. #Factshurt

895 2018-02-07 22:07:15 Have a look at the discount applied to crudes in Alberta, known as the WCS price. This is much lower than WTI price - which is reported on in the news. Most of The WCS discount right now is caused by the bottleneck created from an inability to get our oil to ANY market.
896 2018-02-07 22:07:05 According to Malcom Gladwell the current oil has some issues and isn’t nearly as good as the tallow type they used to use.

901 2018-02-07 22:06:25 #bcpoli No one in Canada would have said 5 years ago that in 2018 we would see an #NDP premier extolling to virtues of #dilbit pipelines. Next they'll be calling #45 a very stable genius. Oil money sure seems to buy a lot of ignorance. #AbLeg
902 2018-02-07 22:05:54 This prove May's point. There's more job growth potential in green energy and it does better when supported by policy. A pipeline is risky at best for the environment and will ultimately reduce the number of jobs in oil.
903 2018-02-07 22:05:52 It isn’t true and it’s a narrow minded thought.  Maybe instead of taxing sales/oil your state should implement a state tax.  Even out the playing field for you. After all, when people don’t need your oil anymore, where will the money come from?  You can’t afford to cut education.

Canada's national interest is to meet its CO2 budget. Building more pipelines and shipping more Tar Sands oil will put us over our limit.   Close them down and clean them up.
913 2018-02-07 22:04:57 So it isn't an actual estimated amount? It's a number from a completely different type of spill? An offshore drilling platform is not an oil tanker, if you haven't noticed. Pretty arbitrary comparison. And there probably won't be a spill in the first place, mind you.
914 2018-02-07 22:04:40 Sir, you do not get the point you just fell into Trudeau's hands he is using you to destroy Canada and the west because Alberta refused to sell oil cheap to Ontario now he is putting a nail into the western coffin @jjhorgan
915 2018-02-07 22:04:23 @BLMNational Please do not allow oil drilling off of the seismically active Oregon Coast. I live in Oregon. It’s beaches are a Nat. Treasure.
916 2018-02-07 22:04:21 Been using that castor oil for my eyelashes the last two weeks and bro incredible already
917 2018-02-07 22:04:17 So if there's an oil spill now it's not your problem. Plus if Albertas didn't supply Chevron with their feed stock you would need more tankers. Like it or not you're at risk. This is just anti Alberta.

I suppose it's the US for us. Thank God Trump won.
918 2018-02-07 22:04:15 finally got a humidifier/essential oil diffuser for my room & my nose and tropical plants are thanking me
919 2018-02-07 22:04:13 and no need for declaratory power really if interprovincial transportation, incl for oil, is federal, which it is. BC talks as if it will enact laws that will need to be litigated.

924 2018-02-07 22:03:52 i got oil paint on my jacket :-( why is the painting class always so messy and mean.....
925 2018-02-07 22:03:49 Getting Cdn crude to other markets will significantly increase Canada’s value for its crude oil.  With most of our exports going to the US, the price we receive is heavily discounted.
926 2018-02-07 22:03:46 Agree about the descent into totalitarianism, I think the China/Russia fears are largely unfounded. The perpetrators are right in front of us: big money, lobbyists for coal, oil, pharma, agri, weapons.

936 2018-02-07 22:02:59 and in other news, i have just spilled BOILING HOT oil on my hand 
937 2018-02-07 22:02:48 These Oil Down names killing me 
938 2018-02-07 22:02:44 @FIA is now banning exhaust gas re-circulation and forcing venting crank case gases/oil vapor to atmosphere along with a minimum air temp in #F1.  There has not ever been any better evidence that the road relevance push by @JeanTodt was utter bullshit than this. Garbage.
939 2018-02-07 22:02:36 @BLMOregon Please do not support, in any way, oil drilling off of our seismically active Oregon Coast. I support Trump, but don’t think our area is stable area for oil rigs.
940 2018-02-07 22:02:26 Snake oil salesman
941 2018-02-07 22:02:24 Truly. Not a single face oil. It's been over 24 hours now
942 2018-02-07 22:02:17 woman at work talking about swilling coconut oil in her mouth to whiten her teeth “meant to do it for 15mins but i could only last 5, my cheeks hurt it felt like i’d given a blow job! and i had to try not to swallow...guess that’s why i’m so popular” ffs i need a new job asap
943 2018-02-07 22:02:08 I had to sign for my Amazon Prime delivery for the first time. Funny it was just a little bottle of essential oil and not my new air purifier where they rang the doorbell and left it. Anyway, aiming for my sinuses to be  clear af.
944 2018-02-07 22:01:59 From the inbox: acting like a 10 year old posting meaningless shit. Go build refineries if you want a market for your “oil”...
945 2018-02-07 22:01:44 Man I completely forgot I had all these oils from those crystal shop places. Zodiac oil, minds eye, insight... And like two I don't remember what I used for very well, and one that has faded text.

I forgot I was into stuff like this since I went through all that drama and moved.
946 2018-02-07 22:01:37 CHEQUEAR ES EL ABC DEL PERIODISMO. CLARINETE SE MANDO UN INCENDIO EN AVIÓN DE AVIANCA Y ERA UN GENERADOR DE GAS OIL ATRÁS DEL AVIÓN. NABOS!!
947 2018-02-07 22:01:27 I over fucking did it with the coconut oil, hair so damn flat I look like a Mexican.
948 2018-02-07 22:01:13 I got some green bananas at Trader Joe's to cook with bacala however I don't like their coconut oil
949 2018-02-07 22:01:03 Driving Safety: Haven't changed your vehicle's oil since October? Why not make an appointment at the garage today!
950 2018-02-07 22:01:02 Everything I've read indicates the depressed oil prices are not directly related to pipeline access to tidewater.

It's still wrong to halt construction of the pipeline, but a significantly better price per barrel because of the transport method is unlikely.
951 2018-02-07 22:01:00 People wrongly assume that #oil is becoming a thing of the past.
952 2018-02-07 22:00:53 OIL DIFF: 3.89 -> 3.89
953 2018-02-07 22:00:52 Thank you for not cleaning up any abandoned wells in AB for decades and to this day nothing has changed. Thanks for leaving toxic mess because oil companies refuse to do reclamation because of costs. #goof
954 2018-02-07 22:00:39 Today’s life lesson: never cook with oil when naked. Ouch!
955 2018-02-07 22:00:38 February 07, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
956 2018-02-07 22:00:37 Government has got to get this spending under control, why don't we do this for a start start selling our oil all over the world if we have so much and bail the country out of debt
957 2018-02-07 22:00:32 I'm all for getting off oil but we need to be realistic
958 2018-02-07 22:00:32 Mehn see tie
959 2018-02-07 22:00:29 Bruhh thats Josh from lakes
960 2018-02-07 22:00:24 That's easy: plutocracy.
961 2018-02-07 22:00:23 So good or bad, we know ‘factually’ that burning fossil fuels produces air pollutants & increases CO2. So why is the pursuit of alternate fuels such a battle w/this Admin? Because they are all oil, coal, & gas investors! So move your investments to alternative energy! DUH!!
962 2018-02-07 22:00:21 腹減ったー休憩休憩ー！おめーも昼はしっかり食えよー！
963 2018-02-07 22:00:19 "why is everyone so obsessed with eyebrows y'all chill" I say with coconut oil streaming down my face, all over my hands, oh my god, my roommate bought this to cook with but decided they hated it, why did they give it to me, why did they do this to me i CANT SEE A THING MY EYES
964 2018-02-07 22:00:18 @TheBodyShopUK is your Camomile Silky Cleansing Oil non comedogenic?
965 2018-02-07 22:00:08 Is there still a problem with Palm Oil on the beach John ?

967 2018-02-07 22:00:07 The push to get off oil is real. It's just not time yet. We're not really technologically there yet to do that
968 2018-02-07 22:00:04 WTI Crude Oil (Nymex)
USD/bbl.61.54-1.85-2.92%Mar 

Brent Crude (ICE)

969 2018-02-07 21:59:56 we could live in a mad max dystopian future with no oil or water . where only the brave and mad survive. still they'd have a queue out the door on a tuesday in feb.
970 2018-02-07 21:59:53 how does BC have a "worldclass oil response" system if we can't even clean up small spills? #bcpoli
971 2018-02-07 21:59:33 How is any of it wrong?
Rachel has done an amazing job of rebuilding AB after decades of PC mismanagement and neglect. And during an oil price crash and without decimating the programs Albertans depend on!
972 2018-02-07 21:59:14 I just can't seem to get on any kind of roll lately - maybe today is the start of a streak:)

Heat +5 -105
Pace +4 -114
Cavs +4 -114

Rangers +125
Oil +116

Lets hear some barking tonight:)

1u each

Tail with caution.
973 2018-02-07 21:58:51 The claims before the ref. were on the basis of leaving immediately with no deal, they are consistent with this prediction. 
But, hey, ignore it, listen to the snake oil salesmen instead #StopBrexit
974 2018-02-07 21:58:48 The oil development from start was used with North money
975 2018-02-07 21:58:42 My oily ass family always used the neutrogena sunscreen that dries as a powder instead of an oil
976 2018-02-07 21:58:31 "The market climbs a wall of worry" is one of the more familiar phrases in finance. -It makes sense as it demonstrates serious reflection before buying. Your financial world has always consisted of cross levering, snake oil sales, investor fraud, etc. so you just don't get it!
977 2018-02-07 21:58:30 add this to Coderre killing oil east Canada doesn't work for Alta.
978 2018-02-07 21:58:23 I’m still pissed. I understand they were busy, which was why the wait was longer than normal, but then not to have even done my oil change? And he only offered me $15 off when I have a coupon all the time for $10 off.
979 2018-02-07 21:58:09 No One man other than Trump in this admin, has ever deserved to be  more hated than greedy, science denying, big oil/coal/gas/chem purchased, planet polluting, slick, soul-less @EPAScottPruitt
980 2018-02-07 21:58:07 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
981 2018-02-07 21:58:05 الله بالعون 
982 2018-02-07 21:57:56 You don’t really expect a drop to 42 tho, right? I guess the arrows will tell us eventually! 
983 2018-02-07 21:57:51 I have bad eczema on my face and the only thing that toned it down the fastest was aloe gel, jojoba oil and keeping stress levels low. Water every day is more effective for your organs. Everyone’s skin is different. U and ur art is so pretty!
984 2018-02-07 21:57:44 You fraud man, you are free to make/fry pakoda in k oil or diesel, you will be considered employed.
And put that round(pakoda) in your own mouth.
985 2018-02-07 21:57:21 What's wrong with palm oil?
986 2018-02-07 21:57:18 We have one of the World's largest proven oil reserves, yet we enrich Nations within the birthplace of Terror. Canada is bought and paid for. We've never truely enjoyed sovereignty. No independence- go figure our Feds are equally dismissive of our needs, as they were to America.
987 2018-02-07 21:57:14 I use coconut oil or baby oil. Glycerin is sticky,, it wouldbe uncomfortable
988 2018-02-07 21:57:13 CBD oil on a Newport makes it a reggie blunt with a seed in it!
989 2018-02-07 21:57:02 I agree - or better yet, Kinder Morgan. However, all the ideas being put forth involve after-the-fact remedies, and clean-up responses to even small, conventional oil spills have been inadequate. I think prevention is the answer (my voice, crying in the wilderness).
990 2018-02-07 21:56:55 WB Des. Just letting my mind wander - oil rig converted into desalination plant and let them slave for say people of Yemen?
991 2018-02-07 21:56:30 The left is quickly reduced to sputtering rage when anyone dares not to kowtow to their absolute power.  Think James II doused in patchouli oil.
992 2018-02-07 21:56:25 Lets not forget that for two years #Erdogan actually gave weapons to #ISIS in return for oil- which his son then sold for cash. They are such a pious family that they will even make deals with the Devil. They betrayed the people of #Turkey #Afrin #Efrim #Syria #BBC #Istanbul
993 2018-02-07 21:56:20 Rachel Notley did absolutely nothing to minimize Alberta’s demise regarding declining oil markets. Having done zero to assure Alberta’s economical survival by developing oil refineries, she now demands BC shoulder her abdication of responsibility to Albertans. No Notley, wear it.
994 2018-02-07 21:56:12 Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm roasted with olive oil and lemon is perfection
995 2018-02-07 21:56:04 Just had a can of Harviestoun "Old Engine Oil". Absolutely gorgeous thick black treacly ale.
996 2018-02-07 21:56:02 The United States has oil reserves on the moon
997 2018-02-07 21:55:58 法制局は憲法などの法律の解釈をする部局であって、権力を行使する事はできません。権力を行使する行政府の行為が法の下に行われているのかを監視する役割です。だから安倍晋三の様なバカは、自分の都合にあった解釈をしてくれる人を法制局長官に替えて、安保法制を制定したでしょ。
998 2018-02-07 21:55:56 The last good rendition I saw was in the garden of the away pub at Villa standing on an old oil barrel iirc
999 2018-02-07 21:55:53 This is the only way?Having BIG Business attack small businesses? Wow,we all have long memories Premier, considering your oil and gas took many of our employees in BC without a thought if our industries while BIG oil and gas were thriving.I was for the pipeline, now not
1000 2018-02-07 21:55:39 Thank you @SenatorCarper and Senator @ChrisCoons for speaking against the U.S. @Interior proposal to open up areas in the Atlantic Ocean, including waters off the #Delaware coastline, to oil and gas drilling.  #ProtectOurCoast #netDE
1001 2018-02-07 21:55:38 i need to rent a man from someone next time i get an oil change. also don’t tell me you’re replacing a nut with one with a bigger head and expect me not to laugh.
1002 2018-02-07 21:55:37 We are all entitled to opinions. I found the Obama’s arrogant and racially divisive, I found the Clintons repulsive( but I was very familiar with their criminal history) and I knew the Bush’s were for oil and not much else.

1004 2018-02-07 21:55:36 We make this amazing pizza that's topped with olive oil, scallions, three eggs, salt and pepper. That's it.

So. Good.
1005 2018-02-07 21:55:15 Not too mention the Apostle John who was dipped into boiling oil..
1006 2018-02-07 21:54:42 “The #economy doesn’t dominate politics [in #Communist #China] as it does in the US. How is it possible multinational #oil companies control #Trump when we know how much this is hurting the earth?” says #PopeFrancis appointee Bishop Marcelo Sánchez Sorondo.
Malevolent @Pontifex
1007 2018-02-07 21:54:39 I think this was the point of the debate. Is the quality of the science proportionate to the hours you work? Burning the midnight oil for passion happens, but if that turns to habit or is forced by industry, it might be nothing but a waist of time. Ironically.
1008 2018-02-07 21:54:16 Got dry hair? Put some coconut oil on it. Got dry skin? Put some coconut oil on it. Got a f*ck boy problem? Put some coconut oil on it.
1009 2018-02-07 21:54:10 Misleading part is that US is going to replace Saudi Arabia. I don't think global market for ultra-light oil is too great right now. This will change when the world figures out that we're burning thru supply at speed of light & need to change refineries to use what's left.
1010 2018-02-07 21:53:50 While the court action takes place, the pipeline construction delay (already 2+ years) will continue to cause depressed oil prices in Alberta... hurting our economy - which was the point of their action in the first place. It’s a stall tactic with no benefit to anyone involved.
1011 2018-02-07 21:53:39 I noticed this too! I refuse to let The Crown Oil Arena win 
1012 2018-02-07 21:53:29 I'd go by what the owners manual says and check the oil level occasionally to make sure it's good.
1013 2018-02-07 21:53:14 he bust out the oil for that tweet
1014 2018-02-07 21:53:12 *takes sip of motor oil
1015 2018-02-07 21:53:10 No Catt, one doesn't use Olive oil to make pancakes 


1016 2018-02-07 21:53:07 Been to the Oil Can Cafe today.... Nice food, great old cars...
1017 2018-02-07 21:52:56 Apply it as lotion just to get that skin glowing more that ever, but I recommend you to use bio oil or tissue oil!
1018 2018-02-07 21:52:31 It's hand-rubbed! With oil!
1019 2018-02-07 21:52:31 Hey guys, did you clear this tweet with Putin? It's too subtle for your base, so it looks like you didn't ask Putin's permission. Careful, he may hold back your oil money if you disobey him. #GoNancyGo
1020 2018-02-07 21:52:26 I know when in worked oil sands in the late 80s into the 90s they had theoretically plans where multilevel piping would work like an elevator sort of roof down and roof up after a one week flush
1021 2018-02-07 21:52:24 Well don’t wait up. I’m just gonna oil up and be right there.
1022 2018-02-07 21:52:14 Me: Hey, if you pan fry noodles...
Nick: Uh-huh?
Me: ...in canola oil...
Nick: Uh-huh...
Me: Is that canoodling?
Nick: *visibly contemplates braining me*
1023 2018-02-07 21:52:05 "Okay then! That was really smart of you, Soleil! It's never bad to ask for help. My only advice is getting sone olive oil, paprika and pepper on it before you put it in the brick oven. Make sure you give it a good hour to cook and leave it alone for a few minutes before-
1024 2018-02-07 21:51:59 I am going to boycott BC wine and only drink Alberta oil. Have I got this right?... #wineboycott
1025 2018-02-07 21:51:36 Oil feeds our families & pays our taxes. We believe in green energy & we also know it will take time for the change.
An assault on our largest industry is an assault on the people of Alberta. 
This assault happened before with the NEP. 
#cdnpoli #MarchOnFernie #abpoli #bcpoli
1026 2018-02-07 21:51:26 Not !!! It’s oil companies getting more more wealthy. You are fighting for them not the people. My family still hurts from your leadership
1027 2018-02-07 21:51:20 The whale blubber and oil were subject to import duties based on weight, hence the scales ...
1028 2018-02-07 21:51:16 オリーブ油で毎日を楽しく(*^_^*)
1029 2018-02-07 21:51:13 Listen dummy, I don’t want to talk in circles with you thanks. I have better things to do, like use plastic, put on makeup, watch a vcr, and drive my hummer around  the city ON pavement!!   (All those things have oil in them or use oil, if you didn’t get it )
1030 2018-02-07 21:51:11 peppermint oil is so strong ffs
1031 2018-02-07 21:51:10 If government is serious about diversifying, they will deal with this Fulani herdsmen wahala just like will always deal with Niger Delta agitators who disturb oil production.
1032 2018-02-07 21:51:05 Just a thought, you can look for a present problem being faced in the oil sector presently and base your project and providing the solution to it.
1033 2018-02-07 21:51:00 Mix castor oil with vitamin E oil and apply before bed. You wont go blind and it works 
1034 2018-02-07 21:50:54 Need my morroccan oil i dead been beastin for this cant get it soooon enough!
1035 2018-02-07 21:50:53 erdogan said the sleeping giant woke up.Usa and european oil sheds blood for you.
1036 2018-02-07 21:50:52 If healthcare was hurting you would not see all the advertising on tv for Drugs and Health insurance. The military has not been replacing vital equipment it's like not changing the oil on your car and ignoring routine maintenance. Soon you have a broken car and no way to work.
1037 2018-02-07 21:50:52 @Oregonian what was the deal with that strong odor last night and this morning?  Smelled like kerosene/jet fuel.  Very strong across Wilsonville, maybe further?  Oil re-refinery + winds + fog?
1038 2018-02-07 21:50:44 ‘Crown oil arena’ basically sounds like a euphemism for the anus
1039 2018-02-07 21:50:42 Motor oil looks like liquid chocolate.  Don’t see people drinking it.
1040 2018-02-07 21:50:16 Their have lots of oil reserves…
1041 2018-02-07 21:50:10 Does that mean you think oil companies should do all of their own cleanup at their own expense in the offshore drilling that you’re trying to get started?
1042 2018-02-07 21:50:10 YeH he’s funny, but he’s no oil painting. Even he’d agree with that!
1043 2018-02-07 21:50:04 That's it, ignore the messenger, far easier than examining the evidence, but then a snake oil salesman has told you migrants and the EU are the cause of all problems #StopBrexit
1044 2018-02-07 21:50:02 From the Inbox: "Premier Notley THANK YOU for standing up for National Interest. THANK YOU for pushing Federal Gov. to move our valued commodity, Alberta Oil. Your commitment, energy & dedication is admired. Keep up your excellent work," – Sylvia, Penticton BC #bcpoli #abpoli
1045 2018-02-07 21:49:59 If that were an actual issue a lot of your province was concerned about that would be understandable. But you can't just hose oil off BC's beaches. I agree we need to build the pipeline, but this stunt has damaged it, possibly beyond repair.
1046 2018-02-07 21:49:45 *he chuckles and morphs his cloths into a mechanics outfit*do ya need your oil changed ma'am haha
1047 2018-02-07 21:49:44 I also live on the coast of Vancouver Island. I have yet to meet 1 person from here who thinks we need more oil takers coming and going in the Salish sea . Your divisive politicking is only creating more entrenched perspectives. (Slow clap)
1048 2018-02-07 21:49:38 BC and Canada should be concerned because oil funds a huge portion of the health care transfers to the Provinces.
1049 2018-02-07 21:49:28 Teora face serum by Ronella. Using natural oil.
1050 2018-02-07 21:49:19 Yeah, those Chinese oil tankers seem to be complying with the sanctions.
1051 2018-02-07 21:49:19 Canada has so much oil that it will become obsolete. The whole point is *offering choices* & let the market decide. But consumers don't have freedom of choice & as a consequence many can't even afford 2 pay utility bill. A couple Ontarians froze to death & Wynne is  still smiling
1052 2018-02-07 21:49:18 Ran out of olive oil to cook my food, is lube an acceptable replacement?
1053 2018-02-07 21:49:07 Freeloaders enjoy all the benefits of OIL and other fossil fuels, and the high standards of living they enable here, but shrink from their duty to share in the costs and risks of oil production.
1054 2018-02-07 21:49:04 Are oil changes as boring for you as they are for me? 
1055 2018-02-07 21:49:01 I've heard about the great benefits of coconut oil and would love to try these capsules. Thank you for the chance to win. I follow and have RT
1056 2018-02-07 21:49:00 オイルの気持ちにもなってよ…
1057 2018-02-07 21:48:55 Feeling ko kasi mas madaling iWork yung dry skin Mesa sa oily. Yung mukha ko parang factory nga spring oil nakakainis 
1058 2018-02-07 21:48:50 Mostly a symbolic gesture but politically necessary. Turning off the oil feeds the green party's goals so that is counter productive to our economic goals. Feds need to step up and end this nonsense.
1059 2018-02-07 21:48:49 The Oil marketers still get forex from CBN @ 285 interbank rate. I wasn't aware that has changed. So, let's say "184"
1060 2018-02-07 21:48:48 I’ve been sitting at @jiffylube for almost 2 hours, waiting for oil change and state inspection. Thry are busy, I get it. They finish, I go up to pay, and they didn’t even do my oil change. Not happy. Already late to an appointment.
1061 2018-02-07 21:48:44 กูแค่ออกกำลังกายตอนตี4 ทำไมต้องตกใจเห่ากูเป็นชั่วโมงขนาดเน้ เห่าตัวเดียวไม่พอ ทั้งซอย ทั้งซอยไม่พอ เบิ่ดคุ้มเลย แมมึงเอ้ย อีหมาหัวควายยยย 
1062 2018-02-07 21:48:40 SAGE, EUCALYPTUS, SANDALWOOD, LAVENDER, PATCHOULI, PEPPERMINT? #oil #diffuse #muscles #breathe I can't decide... help
1063 2018-02-07 21:48:31 When you go to get a lil simple oil change and when you get there they start telling you that you need some more tires and etc etc ... 
1064 2018-02-07 21:48:28 ありがとうございます！！
1065 2018-02-07 21:48:24 Democrats and Smart reminds me of Business Ethics and Oil and Vinegar. Don’t mix well.
1066 2018-02-07 21:48:17 Why did the mechanic who changed my oil add me on Facebook.....
1067 2018-02-07 21:48:03 Check out Empowers CBD oil roller! it's great for joint pain, headaches, arthritic pains and much much more!!
1068 2018-02-07 21:48:00 So you support the premier in Alberta who has waged war on small businesses in BC to further the interests of a foreign oil company who could potentially destroy fisheries and tourism and cost BC trillions in lost revenue if a spill occurs?

1105 2018-02-07 21:44:01 I don't know what changes the sentiment..... oil & natty were/are at high end of potential ranges, so skew for commodity wasn't favorable.... flat-ish commodity means they are execution stories and few can execute.

1141 2018-02-07 21:40:00 I keep hearing mixed messages though, I thought they needed the expansion of a deepwater port to move dilbit to global market where then can get higher value for the oil.

Now China is pushing its way into the Arctic
1217 2018-02-07 21:30:22 You could cancel Trident and sell the new carriers we scrapped the last fleet carrier in ‘79 cause we has no money although we had North Sea oil!

1221 2018-02-07 21:29:40 wait until drew finds out about jobs that carry a significant risk of dying on the job, such as an oil rig worker or fireman.  "wow they must get paid like $5 million/year!!"

1224 2018-02-07 21:29:02 The Canadian economy is on the hook for cleaning up the mess oil companies have made of Alberta. By your own admission oil field workers would be better off working in wineries.  If Alberta wnts to stay in the energy business, it can transition to green. #CDNpoli
1225 2018-02-07 21:28:43 How come no one mentions the US boats that carry oil non stop in the same area in huge carriers on sensitive waters??
1226 2018-02-07 21:28:29 That provision, for anyone not familiar: 

* blocks SF air district from _reducing_ refinery emissions. CA  already 3rd largest oil state in country (and SF area has 2nd largest ops).  

* has been (mis)interpreted by air district to mean they can't even stop massive expansions.
1227 2018-02-07 21:28:13 other than that get a nice gentle cleanser and wash your face when you shower so it’s as routine as that, and an oil free moisturizer

I don't feel much heat at all these days...

1231 2018-02-07 21:27:18 Nope. Not deflecting. Explaining something most liberals don't understand...negotiating. It's real...and it works. When Nafta was negotiated we gave concessions in anticipation of needing Mexico oil so it was a fair deal. Not so today as we will soon be exporting oil.
1232 2018-02-07 21:27:11 The SNP paper for independence and fiscal security  was based on a minimum $ per barrel of oil! Michael, the fact that the minimum $ per barrel has not been attained, for over 3 years, how would you suggest and independent Acotland would cope with the £18 billion deficit?
1233 2018-02-07 21:27:07 Out of jet fuel? Underground Crude Oil runs out in 50 years, underground Natural Gas runs out in 70 years. What will replace liquid fossil fuels?

1239 2018-02-07 21:26:46 I not sure if Stuart agrees, but if we ended dairy/meat production, we would see pyres hundreds of times bigger than the foot & mouth outbreak.

Contrary to vegan dreams, if we don't eat them, we don't need them. Look at soya and palm oil destruction of rain forest species!

1250 2018-02-07 21:25:30 Mr Landis also forgot to mention, that Donald Trump, during one his presidential speeches, said "WE WILL GRAB ALL THEIR OIL".  the same oil that provides revenue for every Syrian to have a "free education" and "free medical care".
1251 2018-02-07 21:25:23 That’s cool.  I mean we still can’t build a pipeline to capitalize on our oil wealth but, you know, priorities.

1253 2018-02-07 21:25:05 Yeah, about 50 years ago. What about it? Cuba doesn’t buy oil at market price, not after Petrocaribe was founded. And it hasn’t been $9 in decades. So what about it?

One of the serious problems with global warming/climate change is our construction is aimed at minimal strength structures which cannot withstand the environmental impact placed upon them. While the earth still has not recovered from past pollution and oil spills.

1262 2018-02-07 21:24:20 I'm really not interested in discussing this, but you don't think oil and coal looked similar when those industries first started? Oil and coal are well established, long running and generate enough money to fund themselves. New tech doesn't have that advantage.

1276 2018-02-07 21:22:36 You should try covering your hair in coconut oil before dying. I always do that. Or at sally they sell like protein additive by ion that is similar to olaplex! Also instead of bleaching multiple times use a wella toner to fix the color

1286 2018-02-07 21:21:34 Maybe try getting your ears syringed? Alterbatively you can warm olive oil and put a drop or two in the afflicted ear. It softens the wax!
1287 2018-02-07 21:21:26 your notepad sucked the oil out of your @GoldfishSmiles crumbs, leaving a disturbing stain in my peripheral line of sight.
1288 2018-02-07 21:21:24 2 points: Exxon Valdez spill occurred when we didn't even have the internet. Things have changed. Dramatically. Also, that spill occurred in Alaska where they continue to ship oil everyday, by much larger tankers, the length of the BC coast. And yet, no moral outrage about that.

1290 2018-02-07 21:21:01 Because of course it's just experts speaking. I bet you have given up seeing doctors as well, as they are so-called experts. Far better to listen to snake oil salesmen with their vested interests at heart #stopbrexit

1296 2018-02-07 21:20:44 Much different action we saw when the last correction happened in Jan of 2016. Oil below 30, credit high yield looked stressed, 10 year yield under 2%. Nothing in play right now

Everyone: THIS IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. BC HAS NO RIGHT TO DO THIS.
Alberta: Ok, well ban BC wine imports to Alberta.
Everyone: Yeah, that makes sense. The two are very related.

1335 2018-02-07 21:15:52 Reminder that "smart business" includes driving healthy enterprises into the ground to claim deductions. This "smart business" crowd cares nothing for consequences. "Smart business" advertises ducklings on dish soap because oil spills by "smart business" are part of their margin.
1336 2018-02-07 21:15:48 Makes you realise we overdo food at home. Just eaten spaghetti with 4 ingredients, olive oil/anchovies/garlic/breadcrumbs and it was stunning!
1337 2018-02-07 21:15:40 Sessions ought to be strapped to a chair and made to watch child after child have an epileptic seizure before they're given cannabis oil.
1338 2018-02-07 21:15:34 Doing a hot oil treatment and a silk press on my hair next weekend 
1339 2018-02-07 21:15:33 Guess what I’m getting an oil change and I have a crush on a dude in the waiting room and we’re watching Rachel Ray give Valentine’s Day plans and what if this is how I fall in love?
1340 2018-02-07 21:15:30 You are showing an article that says Saudi Arabia is selling a barrel of oil at about $60 and that they raise prices. You said Venezuela is selling it to Cuba at $29. I don’t see how that helps your argument.
1341 2018-02-07 21:15:23 Psalms 23:5  Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
1342 2018-02-07 21:15:20 @ariynbf idk about olive oil, cuz that sounds terrible. HOWEVER. My boyfriend's parents brought us back this really expensive balsamic vinegar from Italy, and that is amazing on vanilla ice cream. Doesn't taste vinegary at all.
1343 2018-02-07 21:15:18 got some raw castor oil from Dominica from my coworker... nun tarl tink so
1344 2018-02-07 21:15:11 The Banker and his multi-nationals henchmen came to town ... they heard there was oil money and passive people ...and they somehow convinced the Government , the media and most citizens it was a godsend
1345 2018-02-07 21:14:55 I love it because I say it too! And it ain’t oil honey it ulll #Alabama #RollTide
1346 2018-02-07 21:14:44 The last time I listened to Cooperman was on "Seeking Alpha Conference" a few years ago, his top pick was #SandridgeEnergy I put $15,000.00 in it and it went to $0.00 in about 6 months, they filed bankruptcy after oil went to 26 a barrel.
1347 2018-02-07 21:14:41 Really great now he’s acting like his love Rocket Man. Trump needs to be reined in immediately. He’s such a Snake Oil Salesman

1351 2018-02-07 21:14:12 @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna Sadly it’s been a race to the bottom with our oil industry: low royalties, tax evasion, corporate welfare, foreign ownership, pollution.
1352 2018-02-07 21:14:12 @MikeSmythNews @cknw our premier is playing politics with BC taxpayer money, why? But to appease his base, he & his @bcndp gov know full well this a fight he can't win! We need the money from our oil to fund the transition to cleaner energy. Why can't ppl see that?
1353 2018-02-07 21:14:10 Have you tried solid coconut oil? Smells nice, easy to add essential oils to, relatively cheap, keeps well.
1354 2018-02-07 21:14:06 Go read up on solar panels and how many watts vs joules are produced by them, and then go compare to hydro electric energy. And no, not kinetic waves oil is the future my friend, accept the truth!!
1355 2018-02-07 21:13:47 I would use some oil or WD40. Lol

1363 2018-02-07 21:12:59 Lol so a company accidentally pumped 100 gallons of oil into our basement and flooded our house and also now it smells terrible and everything is covered in oil...
1364 2018-02-07 21:12:56 Actually, the most important position in Canadian leadership is probably a lobbyist or executive of an oil company. Judging by the NEB’s approval of a bad idea.
1365 2018-02-07 21:12:56 As you get older you learn, google will lead you to a coupon FOR EVERYTHING.

1366 2018-02-07 21:12:44 today is my dads birthday and i feel bad because all we got him was car mats and some flavored olive oil

1368 2018-02-07 21:12:10 Why does the Left hate Elon Musk so much? Surely there are a lot worse billionaires out there in finance or in the oil business, yes?
1369 2018-02-07 21:12:05 Haaaaaa! Won't it get too soft to even put inside oil?
1370 2018-02-07 21:12:05 I’m so excited that at this point In my life the 2 hardest decisions I have are if I want a rose gold wedding ring or gold. & if I want to drink castor oil or not tonight to get labor going
1371 2018-02-07 21:11:50 Gotta get yourself some good beard oil (or make your own). There's a reason our near Eastern ancestors anointed themselves with fine oils
1372 2018-02-07 21:11:47 The Federal Government is Americans #1 enemy.!  Oil concentrates money and power in individual hands.  These traitors to Earth are trying to stop solar/wind because they can't make money or consolidate power.
1373 2018-02-07 21:11:45 kat von d has a rlly pale shade too but it’s rlly thick so i usually mix it with smashbox primer oil or rosehip oil! that’s another good one
1374 2018-02-07 21:11:31 My parents? They were raised on Italian food from their parents and grandparents. Lots of vegetables, pasta, olive oil, fresh herbs, meat eaten sparingly.
1375 2018-02-07 21:11:15 I mean, Alaskans can't agree on or understand oil tax legislation either, but I think it's reasonable to expect our elected representatives to, because that's their job. Making the hard decisions about our state budget is literally what they're paid for. #akleg

1380 2018-02-07 21:10:34 When you break it down by industry it gets even more interesting. Beverage companies have a really high profit margin around 20-30% (depends on soft vs alcohol), while oil and gas is like 10-15%. There are also some very complicated numbers, like gross vs net.

1383 2018-02-07 21:10:30 I personally eat boiled eggs. Omelette bhi theek hai but there is a down side that you might need to add oil (extra fat) in the pan and you can also kind of over cook tou protein zaya ho jaye gi.

1385 2018-02-07 21:10:22  the oil of nard !! You come to deliver me sign after sign … my sweet king, bless me with valerian !
1386 2018-02-07 21:10:19 Perhaps oil from other parts of the U.S. should never see land in California either.
1387 2018-02-07 21:10:15 油揚げって言うほど油って感じしなくない？ほんとに騙された気分だよ。
1388 2018-02-07 21:10:11 top tip!! if you have oily skin but dont have any powder or oil blotting papers, rizlas are a good alternative
1389 2018-02-07 21:10:01 Global demand for oil & gas is growing daily. If there is a demand for oil, we'll supply it...simple. The #Climarefraud chants will not make it go away.
1390 2018-02-07 21:09:54 Yeah, I also oil my whole pan, especially when I am not going to use it the next day. I have been known to use soap from time to time, but I usually find it is unnecessary.
1391 2018-02-07 21:09:37 Me when I was a teen: “I can’t wait to get a car! I’ll drive everywhere and be free!”
Me and an adult: “I’ll stay home. Gas is too expensive”
No one tells you how expensive car payments, insurance, registration fees, oil changes, and gas is!
1392 2018-02-07 21:09:20 Saudi Tankers on the coast, pipeline in the ground, raw sewage in the ocean, BC impedes a pipeline that’s passed a rigorous process to get  oil to market. #BoycottBCWine #BoycottBC #TurnOffTheTap (Albertans contributed 1.4 billion to #BCTourism in 2016.)

1396 2018-02-07 21:09:14 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
1397 2018-02-07 21:09:00 yum, i love eating salty oil
1398 2018-02-07 21:08:54 Use coconut oil whilst bleaching!!! It protects your hair a lil bit x

1400 2018-02-07 21:08:43 @lindsayzv I ate Mackie's sea salt chips yesterday and couldn't remember the hashtag! I liked them! Excellent dry texture. I mean I like oil, but to mix it up.
1401 2018-02-07 21:08:25 So in other words, there is NO science about dirty oil in water? @MikeSmythNews
1402 2018-02-07 21:08:19 Where you get that oil with bulk. It's my favorite?
1403 2018-02-07 21:08:13 So you don't have tankers already? She doesn't mean it you know, she doesn't really want the pipeline either. 

In the end no one wins, you ban oil,  we ban wine, you ban beef, we ban grain for your dairy.

This is bad for both.
1404 2018-02-07 21:07:58 Heads-up to #IL06/#IL6 friends: If anyone bitches about Dems not voting for H.R. 1892, ask them why @PeterRoskam had no problem voting in favor after it was crammed with military funding and instructions sell oil from the nation reserves; nothing that has to do with the bill.

1413 2018-02-07 21:07:15 But I wouldn't underestimate Newsom. He might become POTUS someday.
I also don't want my oil price to go sky-high. That's very bad for CA.
1414 2018-02-07 21:07:06 Will have to look for those! My wife got me some sharpie oil based paint pens too, so I am going to be testing those out soon. Have you used either of these?

1419 2018-02-07 21:06:27 Alberta used to export most of its production to the US, but in the last five years the Americans have become not only self-sufficient in oil but a net exporter as well. That means Alberta must find new markets for its energy and Asia is it.
1420 2018-02-07 21:06:12 Well that was fun! Oil and copper closed with losses, but caught the turn in US markets, looking forward to a big down day tomorrow and perhaps fri too. Disciplined trading remains key, I’ll take the stop losses 
1421 2018-02-07 21:06:09 Ew screw that place. I’m at home.. I didn’t get gas or an oil change...

1424 2018-02-07 21:05:25 I didn't know there was a Gulf of Mexico whale?
When you consider the oil disaster it's less surprising that this could happen.
It's more of a concern that we didn't know.
Has anyone got a picture of "Gulfy" the whale?
Go on Twitter...
Save Gulfy...
1425 2018-02-07 21:05:24 If you bought Trudeau’s line ‘it is not environment or industry’  ‘we can do both’ or Rachel Notley’s  ‘the science is in&pipeline will happen then you reject all science on climate change and concept of keeping carbon in the ground.  Regarding oil, Canada’sFeds must choose now.
1426 2018-02-07 21:05:24 I've been eating the 7 super food salad mix from Costco the using my own balsamic and olive oil dressing
1427 2018-02-07 21:05:20 I thought you were an intelligent person.  The pipeline will bring Canadian oil to other countries so that we can sell it for world prices.  This will bring jobs and revenue to Canadians as well as tax revenue to our governments.  When will you preach climate change in China?
1428 2018-02-07 21:05:10 This isn't just theoretical, Canadian based oil companies are already focusing operations just south of the border where poorly structured regulatory bodies make business development much more appealing.

1433 2018-02-07 21:04:25 Explain this gif. I am confused is he pumping oil into the water or what?
1434 2018-02-07 21:04:20 #ukog If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a major oil discovery.

1463 2018-02-07 21:00:37 I scheduled an appointment to get my pussy waxed, blocked one of my boyfriends on all platforms, I’m getting an oil change tomorrow and honestly, i really fucking love self care.
1464 2018-02-07 21:00:36 RED ALERT 3.....
This plan is perfected to empty Ogoniland and frustrate all our suffering over the years. President Buhari is 100% interested in owning the OML 11, which comprises all oil wells in Ogoniland. Ogoni be wise and stand up for your right.

1466 2018-02-07 21:00:33 I actually hate kebab, when I eat it, I can just feel all the oil and grease clogging my arteries
1467 2018-02-07 21:00:33 #Trump: California's state government has threatened to deny pipeline permits for transporting oil from new leases off the Pacific Coast. Rawstory is reporting
1468 2018-02-07 21:00:32 More like vape cartridges and two stroke yeh?
Maybe that's the campaign promise right there...subsidised vapes, two stroke oil and discounted lawn pruning accoutrmenats for all Aussies.
1469 2018-02-07 21:00:14 Apply jojoba oil for 20 minutes before going to the shower. This promotes fast hair growth!
1470 2018-02-07 21:00:00 LOVE TO OIL YOU UP AND DOWN
1471 2018-02-07 20:59:56 What if lessons were learned from the #deepwater Horizon tragedy as is always the case and now oil extraction is safer than ever? What if? What if? What if unicorns start coming out of the pipe? What then?
1472 2018-02-07 20:59:55 Bro how you a grown ass man and don’t know how to check your own oil 
1473 2018-02-07 20:59:32 Many people, ministries & churches try to operate in today’s season with yesterday’s oil. What we need is some new wine, a fresh oil for this generation!

1474 2018-02-07 20:59:20 If more women wanted to work in the oil field or coal mine, the #genderwagegap wouldn't be so bad in Wyoming. The mining industry is the leading industry in the Equality State, and that profession doesn't draw many of the smart and talented women that reside in the state.
1475 2018-02-07 20:59:19 Thanks.  Had some beechams and otrivine spray, (which is now burning my nose, not great!), olbas oil on a tissue beside me, but still no relief for my sinuses. Can see it being a long night. 
1476 2018-02-07 20:59:11 Increase as a result of oil....
Thnks 

Now ask ursef
Wen ur hero was dea. How much was oil?
How much was ur savings ? 
#common sense#
1477 2018-02-07 20:59:05 Safer than oil tankers up the Bay of Fundy or the St. Lawrence Seaway? Research has been - and continues - to be done to ensure Canada's coasts are protected.
1478 2018-02-07 20:58:51 This is going to be awkward. Alberta boy living in Van since '89, loyal to the Oil since the 70's and a full on enviro/cyclist SJW. I love both provinces and I have people from both in my timewine, uh, line. #wineboycott #winewar #BCwinepledge #BCWine #nopipelines #MarchOnFernie
1479 2018-02-07 20:58:49 It took a lot of oil to keep them gates from squeaking. They need to go to jail as that’s disgusting
1480 2018-02-07 20:58:37 RED ALERT 1.......
Reliable information reaching us has it that, the ongoing pipeline maintenance in Ogoni is a secret means schemed to resume oil production. The oil, water and gas will be pipelined to somewhere in Akwa Ibom State were separation will be done.
1481 2018-02-07 20:58:35 Beard oil is expensive, yo.
1482 2018-02-07 20:58:28 I expect by the end of the year oil to get back to close $80 dollars range #wti #oil
1483 2018-02-07 20:58:23 Just ate my first plate of oil down, round 2 later on.
1484 2018-02-07 20:58:06 Es geht ja auch um Big Oil so hat doch alles angefangen.
1485 2018-02-07 20:57:56 Sounds like it needs an oil change....
1486 2018-02-07 20:57:54 You need to make sure the fryer is on. The cold oil does not activate the chemicals haha.
1487 2018-02-07 20:57:48 @bcalmanac -No heavy oil should be piped to the coast-a new high tech refinery in Alberta or NE BC should be built, to refine to the highest grades possible to then be used domestically or exported.
1488 2018-02-07 20:57:44 @RachelNotley Sadly you choose Neoliberal values over traditional NDP Progressive values...SHAME!!! You sell your soul for oil $$$ #Notley
1489 2018-02-07 20:57:40 I generally use unsalted butter (best for baking, and I'm super sensitive to salt — probably because I hardly every eat fast food) or olive oil.
1490 2018-02-07 20:57:11 the power of oils is just amazing. i use grape seed oil for my face, almond oil under eyes, neck, décolletage and hands and macadamia oil for hair

1492 2018-02-07 20:56:50 Always be sure to saute your kale with coconut oil. This makes it easier to slide out of the pan and into the trash.
1493 2018-02-07 20:56:46 because they are solders sent by your country to make chaos in middleeast so oil can be cheaper so they can increases thier marketing and selling .
1494 2018-02-07 20:56:25 Here we go typical Texas fan living off 2005 and reruns of failed Longhorn network Rose bowl game. Moral Victory U in a empty stadium  with a snake oil salesman coach.  Yeah let’s get excited...........
1495 2018-02-07 20:56:17 You rock. Have you tried oils?  We had a Great Dane that had some issues and we would rub the oil under her neck. Worked amazing!

1498 2018-02-07 20:55:43 lmao Alberta boycotting bc wine as they push their oil through our coasts and communities

1501 2018-02-07 20:55:07 Chuck Norris once had an erection while lying face down and struck oil.
1502 2018-02-07 20:54:49 Honestly that might've just added an oil tanker's worth of fuel to an already out of control dumpster fire.
1503 2018-02-07 20:54:47 He is happy to pull every barrel of oil out of the land, sell weapons to dictators & treat indigenous people as props but hey does any of that hurt People Kind????
1504 2018-02-07 20:54:39 Ayo who got the Oil Down on deck tonight??
1505 2018-02-07 20:54:35 today in plant bio we split open magnolia leaves to release the oil and it was the most beautiful thing
1506 2018-02-07 20:54:05 California residents love driving cars. Oil is refined into gasoline to power those cars. This is top shelf NIMBYism. California is a mess.
1507 2018-02-07 20:54:01 Cuba buys Venezuelan oil below market price. Venezuela pretty much gives oil for free to most Caribbean islands.
1508 2018-02-07 20:53:54 No, you’ll just tax the oil that we do have access to. So gas will become even higher priced in this state. I can’t wait until you lose in November.
1509 2018-02-07 20:53:52 Indeed, the US should be blockading Venezuela, not just banning the purchase of  oil.

1512 2018-02-07 20:53:29 for picking up this topic which was never spoken..still remember how society made me feel the first time I got it, like it’s a sin or crime.. don’t see,don’t touch and said just to eat red chill powder with oil & rice so I don’t smell bad. hygiene and healthy wasn’t a option
1513 2018-02-07 20:53:29 i go to events & they feed us & usually gift cards too. ive gotten a couple free oil changes based on feedback too lol but not just random coupons
1514 2018-02-07 20:53:14 that oil will do it to you, it made me go get a gym member ship
1515 2018-02-07 20:53:12 lmao I’m out here getting an oil change & I was confused why my music wasn’t playing through my earphones until I realized it was connected to my car via bluetooth. poor guys out there simpin to mariah carey oops

1520 2018-02-07 20:52:35 I tried making popcorn once. 
I put the oil in. Set it on high. 
Forgot bout it.
It lit on fire.
Had to renovate my kitchen. #Whyimsingle
1521 2018-02-07 20:52:32 Checking the engine oil level, even though the oil had been changed two days prior.

1524 2018-02-07 20:52:20 What’s wrong with this picture ?Canadian Oil,  WCS now selling for a paltry $29.79 US a barrel vs. WTI at 61.79
1525 2018-02-07 20:52:04 someone tell me how i work at a car repair shop owned by my dad and was 20,000 miles over for my oil change
1526 2018-02-07 20:52:03 it's february 7th, 2018 and elon musk is still a snake oil salesman
1527 2018-02-07 20:52:03 The purported foreign reserve has not impacted positively in the life of the average Nigerian. So what's the hoot? Infact, it's as a result of the increase in the price of crude oil. Shikina!
1528 2018-02-07 20:52:00 @LizClaman My theory in ref. to oil production/glut and I've been saying this. We and ME principles want Putin out of Syria ASAP and we've tried diplomacy. Coordinated 2 prong attack; proxy war, and drive oil down to $10 bbl to disrupt his election prospect and push him out.
1529 2018-02-07 20:51:46 @Walmart on Cone is the worse place to ever go get an oil change

1532 2018-02-07 20:51:26 I feel like a broken record when I talk about the gas infrastructure issues in NE. And the high reliance on oil. Remember: Jan 2017 avg LMP $40/MWh, Jan 2018 avg LMP $120/MWh all due to the gas getting curtailed
1533 2018-02-07 20:51:02 Did you not see Peston on Sunday. Former leader of civil service calling Brexit voters snake oil

1536 2018-02-07 20:50:43 Given the production issues and now recalls I can't see them making the number. But then again, Musk is a snake oil salesman. Flamethrower sales will push them over  lol
1537 2018-02-07 20:50:22 I've heard Tony Blair is coming back into politics after he finishes his 'Why we shouldn't start illegal wars for oil and be responsible for the deaths of 1.5M Iraqis' course.

1538 2018-02-07 20:50:17 Thanks for cooking our beef, Ian. It was superb, and I learned a lot...I'll never trim my shin or put oil straight into the frying pan to fry my beef again. Ashamed to say I've been guilty of cooking mushrooms to extinction, too!

1541 2018-02-07 20:49:54 Last time I got an oil change I saw a big buck cross the road. Today it was time for me to get another one. Saw three deer cross the road in the same exact area.
1542 2018-02-07 20:49:51 Lab does realize that TWC is in Atlanta, not Chicago; and that we don't use oil lamps now..
1543 2018-02-07 20:49:47 I now have the name of the insurer for #DrCharles.
Also have the names of the guy who delivered the oil and the one who came to "clean up" and took the contaminated soil off the property to who knows where. Hope it was recycled into mulch or gardening soil...
1544 2018-02-07 20:49:39 More whataboutism. Then maybe don’t call the country that buys most of your oil the “devil.”
1545 2018-02-07 20:49:37 Bla bla bla... should I bring the oil and pliers... yes or no...?... 
1546 2018-02-07 20:49:19 Professional lying snake  oil salesman along with the democrat party & lying criminal DNC Fake News
1547 2018-02-07 20:49:16 Possible, don't know it infers badness.
Pittsburgh was the third largest corporate HQ city in America at one time and that helped drive growth and jobs. Westinghouse, Gulf Oil. USSteel, etal.
But the Democrats and Unions took over and ruined this city along with hundred others
1548 2018-02-07 20:49:10 Nice whataboutism. You do realize Venezuela can still sell oil to other markets, right. Venezuela can sell oil to China, just like its already been doing. The US not buying shitty oil, because it’s heavy crude, from Venezuela shouldn’t be a big deal. Since they are “pigs.”
1549 2018-02-07 20:49:05 Despite this my wife called the centre last week and no one mentioned the 19,000 milage and confirmed can have interim service. I took a call last week from the centre last wed and again no one mentioned anything about the mileage....just about an oil light!
1550 2018-02-07 20:49:05 I just walked out of 2 @Krystal near Smyrna TN. Restrooms were filthy, facility was dirty and smelly AND the employees were dirty. I don't want to order food from a person that looks like they've been changing oil in a car. Being clean isn't that challenging.
1551 2018-02-07 20:49:02 If you find that your hair has split ends, you may want to try using a hot oil treatment.

1553 2018-02-07 20:48:58 Shove your pipeline - I for one do not believe the reward outstrips the risk. Leave the oil in the ground and spend your money on clean energy
1554 2018-02-07 20:48:52 I totally support refining heavy oil here in Canada and ideally a new state of the art refinery in Northeastern BC or Western Alberta.  Any shipping of oil based products from the west coast of Canada must be fully refined and at least potentially harmful to our coast
1555 2018-02-07 20:48:47 Lets not get the game fucked up now Just because you in something new don’t mean  . You just tryna keep up with the Jones your past tenseRusty a piece of shit chuggin along with a knocking in it!!Yo shit can’t do that chocking if it’s no oil in it!!

1557 2018-02-07 20:48:43 What if, we already pay higher oil prices in California, thanks to Gavin and his Democratic legislators buddies. Hell we pay higher in CA on everything, Gas, electric, taxes, Vehicles, food, water, etc all because of the Dems on Sacramento
1558 2018-02-07 20:48:23 how come, could please elaborate more ?
the way i see it, we had higher demand as evident by oil inventories, higher than expected world growing economy along side a declining dollar which made oil even cheaper, and not so much of a supply increase ... ?
1559 2018-02-07 20:48:20 I just shaved my legs with Baby oil I have never been this soft
1560 2018-02-07 20:48:14 I rather like roast cauliflower, but I'd never tried sports before -bit of olive oil, garlic and herbs. They really were yummy.

1563 2018-02-07 20:48:08 To be fair, the mission was never to end the war or install a stable state. It was to remove Hussein, secure the oil and destabilize the entire region. Accomplished, indeed.
1564 2018-02-07 20:48:03 My answer is: ask Tillerson if he and Exxon have continued their oil deals non-stop in spite of sanctions under Obama and even the ones Trump has yet to implement. It's not "very difficult" to preempt Russian interference if the Trump Admin. even tries. But they won't.
1565 2018-02-07 20:48:02 $CHK WTI oil is still 20% higher today than one year ago.
1566 2018-02-07 20:47:42 Did you try cleaning it with tree tea oil? That would work for me!
1567 2018-02-07 20:47:42 It’s time to keep your dirty oil in the ground, and create new clean energy jobs.

1572 2018-02-07 20:47:28 Oil spill statistics in Canada. The largest oil spill in Canada occurred off the East Coast in 1970. The tanker M/T Arrow spilled over 10,000 tonnes of oil off Nova Scotia. This is about one quarter the amount spilled in US waters by the Exxon Valdez in 1989.Jul 8, 2016

1575 2018-02-07 20:47:03 Have had to smother my left foot in lavender oil and wear a sock over it at night as the whole top part broke out really bad over the few days ago .The sole is fine and the skin has stopped weeping today.Have been eating 4+ cloves of garlic a day and take 2 strong garlic tabs/day

1577 2018-02-07 20:46:51 I know a lot of you are fellow foodies. What are your favorite culinary uses for coconut oil? I bought a jar for a recipe that only needed a couple tablespoon of it. Don't want it to go bad.
1578 2018-02-07 20:46:39 That being said, when do you think the government will stop subsidizing oil?
1579 2018-02-07 20:46:33 Should i take a nap or get my oil changed??
1580 2018-02-07 20:46:30 Violation of human rights and abuse of children n women r very normal in Saudi Arabia unfortunately but no one says anything bcoz of their oil!

1586 2018-02-07 20:45:58 This seems like an empty move, to me. My bet is that the oil companies were planning on exporting it all, anyway.
1587 2018-02-07 20:45:54 This is what globalist want Syria sovthe can split it up amongst oil companies
1588 2018-02-07 20:45:50 Oil has been on a tear as has the Euro. European equities are now where they were after the French elections but still sold off just as hard

1590 2018-02-07 20:45:40 The falcon 9 uses about 100,000 litres of kerosene in the first stage. There's three falcon 9 rockets in the falcon heavy.
All that modern technology and everybody forgets that it is crude oil that (literally) fuels spaceflight.
Legendary achievement either way
1591 2018-02-07 20:45:38 So explain to me how the US choosing not to sell oil to a country that claims the US is an evil imperialist state a bad thing? 

Shouldn’t Venezuela, which calls American presidents sulfur reeking demons, be happy that they no longer do business with such people?
1592 2018-02-07 20:45:37 The world will get its oil from somewhere and Canada and Canadians need the revenue / income from selling our oil to the world.
1593 2018-02-07 20:45:34 Let's all buy American or Canadian oil

1599 2018-02-07 20:44:55 As always, snake oil salesman AJ has twisted truth into conspiracy. Gülen was considered a “radical” in Pakistan for teaching a modern & moderate alternative to extreme Sunni Islam. Emphasizing science & math, his schools served as an alternative to more fundamentalist madrassas.
1600 2018-02-07 20:44:47 Come on. It's about Russian oil. Ryan does Koch's bidding for him. The Russian interference is more about oil money then it is payback for USSR collapse or Putin's dislike of Hillary. And, the tentacles of this monster reaches into Congress!
1601 2018-02-07 20:44:40 I’m pretty sure the issue wasn’t whether he was qualified, just that he could get $1/2 trillion Exxon/Putin oil deal through in spite of sanctions against Russia.  Oh, and to get rid of career diplomats who know what was going on.  It’s all about the .
1602 2018-02-07 20:44:37 Man, you guys are starting to sound like Ken Peak, who I miss.  He was one of the only adults in the Oil & Gas patch.
1603 2018-02-07 20:44:36 We have been killing each other for oil for many decades...
@BarackObama knew that so his admin gave tax breaks for domestic production and also for alternative energies... @realDonaldTrump knows that so he supports increased domestic production.
#California seems to not care...
1604 2018-02-07 20:44:27 i used a tea tree oil face wash for years till @bringinsexybach explained to me that i was just making my issues worse
1605 2018-02-07 20:44:07 But that Alberta  oil has such a unique terroir...
1606 2018-02-07 20:44:06 I can hold bitcoin for a year easy.
1607 2018-02-07 20:43:43 You are hypocrite. Get the gas companies to set aside 1billion for spill clean up. Then I'll support the pipeline. We always pay for clean ups.  This project will give what 30jobs in BC? 

You should hold a referendum to get out of Canada. Canada does not belong to oil companies!
1608 2018-02-07 20:43:33 Alberta will make 70% more from Kinder Morgan than BC Spills will happen Bitumin oil is impossible to completely clean up and will leave devastating impacts on BC Now @RachelNotley is complaining about proposed restrictions by banning BC wine in Alberta? Fuck off #bcpoli #abpoli

1611 2018-02-07 20:43:24 Fossil fuel combustion is the main source of CO2. Per unit of energy, coal emits most, followed by oil and gas. #climateeconomics
1612 2018-02-07 20:43:17 Dude, you're gonna lose sooo much money. Buy the dip!
1613 2018-02-07 20:43:13 Check your Engine oil this morning.
1614 2018-02-07 20:43:08 I get my oil shipped to me right from the maker in bc so I guess that's why I like it a lot better. The quality and prices are untouchable. I pay $25 a gram for cannabis oil that is 80% thc or more depending on the strain. Retail would be $50 or more. Taxes too.
1615 2018-02-07 20:43:08 but LAV's ... those are untouchable HAHA
Jobs and Oil - anything outside of that, we suddenly have morals.
1616 2018-02-07 20:43:07 Don't worry BC your wine is much better for everyone's health than Alberta oil, and since the best BC wines are hard to find, I am sure other provinces and the rest of the world can pick up the slack.
1617 2018-02-07 20:43:05 No he is insinuating the treatment that a lady from North done this
1618 2018-02-07 20:43:03 Well he should step in all this is doing is hurting all of Canada. But IMO he will drag his feet, he is no fan of Alberta and loves his #SJW agenda which lines up with anti oil
1619 2018-02-07 20:43:02 Next... don't eat Tide Pods, do heroine, bang Back Alley Sally, try to pop corn in your corn hole, try to tung a camel, eat LSD with oil while watching Old School or go to Florida.
1620 2018-02-07 20:43:00 Yea Blad3zero. Any help would be appreciated, I’m probably gonna be burning the midnight oil hunting for replacement set to refill
1621 2018-02-07 20:42:59 thing is this is the second hottest the dragon's breath is made in wales and measures at 2.5m scovilles it can literally close your airways and kill you but the oil it secrets numbs your skin

1630 2018-02-07 20:42:18 And... this tug spilled DIESEL not oil. Your off topic. 
As I said before diesel is far far worse than bitumen in the unlikely event of a oil spill.
You haven't answered my question.  
When was the last time their was an oil spill in BC'S waters?
1631 2018-02-07 20:42:13 Because we should all buy as the price goes up to all time highs right?
1632 2018-02-07 20:42:03 Punishing BC Winemakers due to a completely unrelated issue of oil pipelines is ridiculous and unwarranted.
1633 2018-02-07 20:42:00 Absolutely! It looks like Korea is getting ready to finally resolve there issues. Once that happens we will be fully back on track
1634 2018-02-07 20:41:59 The drop in oil prices certainly contributed to that.  What is Alberta doing to help those thousands unemployed, besides threatening the livelihoods of people who will be affected by oil spills?
1635 2018-02-07 20:41:47 yeah i think he uses it for everything? is it a good oil? anyway I also always add compulsively rayu
1636 2018-02-07 20:41:37 You do realize that this attack on BC wine is a direct result of the BC government's unconstitutional attack on Albertan oil and the federally approved Kinder Morgan Pipeline? #HorganWineWars #readtheconstitution #bcpoli #StevestonBC
1637 2018-02-07 20:41:30 They see that $179 a month and don't account for insurance, gas, oil, maintenance on and on

1641 2018-02-07 20:40:43 So they say cucumbers hate oil.
1642 2018-02-07 20:40:43 It's OK. They're Muslims and have no oil.
1643 2018-02-07 20:40:35 I always dry it on a burner and oil inside and out to ensure even seasoning-only oiling the inside can make the outside weaker resulting in cracks.
1644 2018-02-07 20:40:30 We don't need oil any more, look at the price.

1646 2018-02-07 20:40:21 Liar, liar. This all just feels too set up.
My jury is still out on all this politics.
Probably wrong but it's just a feeling.
Our forests are gone.look! Fracting takes what's left of our oil and next the complete removal of coal again. Now poisoning the dirt.DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT.
1647 2018-02-07 20:40:20 Blah guess I’ll go get this oil change
1648 2018-02-07 20:40:09 So my main dairy substitute has been coconut. I also put coconut oil in my hair. I feel weird eating and wearing the same thing. I am a coconut.

1653 2018-02-07 20:39:31 How to kill a pipeline - For Keystone XL to work financially, the price of oil needs to be $80-90 a barrel, with an upward trajectory, says Mr Sanzillo. The price of oil is at $60 a barrel.
1654 2018-02-07 20:39:23 BC will have to find alternate markets for food. As Alta will for oil so their children eat.

Make Russia know they will be held accountable.Oh but you Russian coworkers cant do that to your money pot! #Impeach45
1657 2018-02-07 20:38:59 Yeah I like it in banana/peanut butter shake seems easier to add to the blender. I thought the lack of oil in it made it healthier option though. Is that not so?
1658 2018-02-07 20:38:50 The man is in denial and beholden to big oil as shown by his record as AG

1668 2018-02-07 20:37:40 Oh I've dabbled. I find LP quality from my producers is always higher than what I find at a dispensary. I don't use oil or concentrates, they are too heavy on THC.
1669 2018-02-07 20:37:20 I went with edamame, chickpeas, beets, and a heavy helping of feta on spring mix w/ olive oil and balsamic. A Whole Foods within walking distance of my conference hotel has definitely been a blessing in the past.
1670 2018-02-07 20:37:19 oil prices are up, then Russia and you had two choices of adversary, who would you pick?
1671 2018-02-07 20:36:41 No olive oil, spring break is 3 weeks away
1672 2018-02-07 20:36:38 Too bad, the idea of relying on oil to grow the economy of your province was stupid to begin with. Now face the consequences. Time to create jobs in sectors that don't compromise the future of our children. While you think of something, I'll be enjoying my glass of fine BC wine.
1673 2018-02-07 20:36:36 اي وبقوهه
1674 2018-02-07 20:36:27 Alberta has a lot of oil and is trying to get it to market.

The federal government approved the expansion of a pipeline through BC to do so.

The BC government has taken measures to block it even though once federal approval has been given on a project with national interest...
1675 2018-02-07 20:36:26 Alberta can't even clean up the mess that has been made producing this oil.
1676 2018-02-07 20:36:25 Do pasta. Even if you only have some cheese and olive oil  that's going to make a supper.

1685 2018-02-07 20:35:26 Why cant any of the proponents for this pipeline give a reason for why we cant refine it here?Also,how can we strive for a much needed carbon neutral plan when we push things like this through?Why not use all the funds from the oil to fund projects so we wont need it in 10 years?

1713 2018-02-07 20:32:25 It has to end eventually. Enjoy the toxic legacy. Diversify that economy. We in the east get our oil elsewhere. Sorry you are land locked and nobody wants a pipeline to take dirty tar sands ecological blight oil. Catch up with the times Mr anachronism
1714 2018-02-07 20:32:18 I mean like, the auto and oil industry (not to mention maintenance and insurance) have got to be SO STOKED that Uber and Lyft “disrupted” the taxi industry
1715 2018-02-07 20:32:14 All your points are valid, but you're forgetting that an increase 500,000 barrels of oil a day will create more jobs in Alberta than any construction jobs in BC. There's no magical switch that allows oil companies to pump out more product. Man hours would skyrocket.

1740 2018-02-07 20:28:25 Snake Oil stocks crash on news that it's "all been a load of bollocks from the start."
1741 2018-02-07 20:28:22 The ship when you first go aboard, the smell of fuel oil, coffee, paint, cigarette smoke and sweat.
1742 2018-02-07 20:28:15 It's a bit like homoeopathy. Instead of getting a factual diagnose and the best possible treatment for an illness, you go for the ego caressing snake oil that makes you feel good but doesn't do anything about the real issue.
1743 2018-02-07 20:28:02 I swear, trying to hang out with @Viviannaaa_xx is like trying to mix oil and water because our schedules are the polar opposite  even when we do figure it out something happens and it ends up getting canceled 
1744 2018-02-07 20:27:56 What purpose that that serves Mr. Newsom if it may help Californians and maybe lower oil prices? Are you going to allow oil drilling in CA? This seems more of a vendetta than seeing if it benefits CA.

1746 2018-02-07 20:27:40 Most natural resources probably should be nationalized. Particularly ones like oil and gas that are critical to our way of life.
1747 2018-02-07 20:26:59 Please no oil pipelines! Republicans often use "Infrastructure" as code for "pipelines" 
 #NoDAPL 

We need:
Water in Flint MI
Electricity in Puerto Rico
Modern electrical grid
Rural Broadband
1748 2018-02-07 20:26:41 The oil industry is a dying industry. Clean energy will thrive no matter what republicans try to do to kill it.
1749 2018-02-07 20:26:38 There’s no such thing as clean coal or clean oil burning. If you think there is, I invite you to breath nothing but coal/oil burn-off and find out how “clean” it is. But you won’t because you know you’re lying.
1750 2018-02-07 20:26:26 This Indian man just left my branch smell like palm oil ...
1751 2018-02-07 20:26:25 Yep. Real clean beaches. Funny how Gavin never freaked when Tijuana sewers poured shit into San Diego beaches and then did so again and again prompting beach closures and causing serious environmental harm. But Trump promoted oil? Game on.
1752 2018-02-07 20:26:18 Joe - i am very respectful. i want Alberta to keep the oil. make all the devices in the world! And make a fortune! and leave us our wine to enjoy. All the best. .@RachelNotley
1753 2018-02-07 20:26:00 [9:25PM] @TransOceana: Coming to JAKANDE LEKKI from WORLD OIL FILLING STATION right now is ok @Gidi_Traffic #GIDITRAFFIC
1754 2018-02-07 20:25:57 The railroad built communities, linked shipping for all trade across the entire country for mining, retail, agriculture, raw materials, crude oil etc, so it was no bitumen pipeline. All I'm saying is that much of the pipeline work and construction will actually be in BC, not AB.
1755 2018-02-07 20:25:55 I realize this may come as a shock, but being able to spell & use proper grammar does not preclude one from seeing the big picture. Trump is nothing but a two-bit conman. Enjoy the snake oil.

1759 2018-02-07 20:25:10 Oil prices have come down 8% since Goldman Sachs predicted an increase last week...
1760 2018-02-07 20:25:10 had Midnight Oil stuck in my head last night for no reason. Maybe it was playing in the background at the grocery store or something? Seriously what the hell
1761 2018-02-07 20:25:10 What is this clean oil and coal you speak of?
1762 2018-02-07 20:24:34 Oil may not appear like this as distortions overshoot and has to rebalance, If spculators knew what they were doing they would be record short at the bottom and record long at the tops - that is the action of Sheeple
1763 2018-02-07 20:24:33 No such thing as clean coal or oil
1764 2018-02-07 20:24:25 Let's go back to school
 Which process separate Water from oil?
1765 2018-02-07 20:24:21 Oil and Gold are puking. It’s so much more fun being short. Escalator up, elevator down!!!
1766 2018-02-07 20:24:16 We have the fastest growing economy in Canada, lowest taxes, no PST, no health premiums, rapidly increasing investment, and growing business. AND a Climate Leadership Plan admired all around the world. Oil co support it.
1767 2018-02-07 20:24:16 Aberdeen as fuck that is. It's actually an oil rig. Subtle aye
1768 2018-02-07 20:24:06 Say no to #House Boat and yes to #Staff Quarter# in oil producing Communities in the Riverine areas of Niger Delta. It is one of the factors contributing to underdevelopment and lack of basic infrastructure in the Riverine Communities of the Niger Delta
1769 2018-02-07 20:24:04 The heating oil arrived a day early and the heating is on now! The house is warming up. Praise be. 

The boiler is so ridiculously noisy. I can only just hear it up here (much quieter than the heat exchangers) but it'll annoy anyone who moves in next door.
1770 2018-02-07 20:24:03 We'll see what happens: Will Pence meet Kims (YoJong&YongNam)? Will Ivanka meet Kim's sister? How close to the Kims would Pence & Ivanka sit? Will NK unleash any trump card at military parade? Will South Korea waive sanctions, provide oil for refueling the NK ferry? #northkorea
1771 2018-02-07 20:23:57 My mom would put a drop of baby oil on a Q-tip, then she swipe it along the rim of the canal.

1775 2018-02-07 20:23:25 Need to oil Mother soon. Get all the hard-to-reach places.
1776 2018-02-07 20:23:21 Another old saying is oil price is determined by oil price, meaning when it gets to high it over produces, too low the inverse and on and on it goes. It is one of the true free markets despite all the meddling by speculators and cartels.
1777 2018-02-07 20:23:19 You are the Saudi Arabia of the north and get all of the benefits from the oil patch.  Maybe you should get the money from your new best friend @JustinTrudeau before he loses his seats in BC just like Harper did when he messed with the coastline.
1778 2018-02-07 20:23:08 Please reach out to our Instant Oil  Customer Care team at 1-800-327-8242 or via email at customercare@valvoline.com. They can get more info and provide assistance.
1779 2018-02-07 20:23:00 Guess what California? Your fuel prices were raised by Gavin and Co. Your registration was raised by Gavin and Co. And they'll ban oil which will also raise prices. 
Great leadership Gavin. How's Harvey Weinstein's money doin in your account?

1782 2018-02-07 20:22:48 They tell you Lord is ur shepherd and give u annoitting oil while they employed armed security men.

They tell u material possession is vanity while they scam you in the name of tithe to buy private jets and set up schools you can't afford.

How are you better the Nothern "cows"
1783 2018-02-07 20:22:45 wow okay so clove oil is literally the best thing on earth !!!! if u have a super bad tooth ache buy some bc i literally was on the verge of passing out from pain and now i can’t feel a thing
1784 2018-02-07 20:22:34 An incredibly spot-on op-ed on your part, but an incredibly sad one as well, since far too many people have no problem with driving various species into extinction, almost solely for the benefit of the oil industry.
1785 2018-02-07 20:22:28 It’s just annoying that a gas efficient car uses some rare full synthetic oil lol.. on the bright side I don’t have to worry about the next 10,000 miles
1786 2018-02-07 20:22:24 must be oil or gold under that car park. A shite bit of land in a shite area, they’ll want UNESCO declaring it a world heritage site soon.
1787 2018-02-07 20:22:11 Illegal aliens. Not heard any attacks on actual immigrants.
1788 2018-02-07 20:22:06 I challenge you to totally live independently from any and all petroleum products. And kinetic wave energy is just about as useless as solar panels. You wouldn’t understand if you don’t work in the oil industry there guy.
1789 2018-02-07 20:22:06 Just got around to looking at #oil data. Production numbers have to be a concern #wti

1792 2018-02-07 20:21:40 Ed the oil stain your all over twitter
1793 2018-02-07 20:21:30 Good Rony! You need to allow Stem cell research and use, Cannabis oil and several other medicinal medicines that you and your big industry that supports you and your cronies!
1794 2018-02-07 20:21:28 @CBCVancouver  Absolutely we need to protect our coastline, but please don't avoid facing the issues for Alberta by blaming Quebec. Quebecers were horrified by the oil running through their cities. Dig deeper.
1795 2018-02-07 20:21:27 What if Californians have to pay higher oil price? What then? Would voters like that?
Do you have a plan to control oil price in CA vs. other States?
1796 2018-02-07 20:21:26 The oil in Generac pressure washer should be changed after every 20 hours of usage. RT to spread this #MaintenanceTip
1797 2018-02-07 20:21:25 Joel has been taking the oil for 10 days and says “pain is gone neuropathy is gone and Im sleeping better!”

How awesome is that?!
1798 2018-02-07 20:21:24 Is it OK to just drink chorizo oil? Asking for me.

1804 2018-02-07 20:20:21 Biggest disappointment in years. Arguably  worst Trump appointment to date.
1805 2018-02-07 20:20:20 However, at least: coconut sugar, coconut oil, maple syrup, chunky rock salt, and probably more.
1806 2018-02-07 20:20:12 What frustrates me watching Trump is not only furthering this delay but actively delaying government-led renewable energy initiatives. Private industry helps somewhat, but further increasing oil/gas drilling, enacting solar tariffs, and empowering polluters worsens everything.
1807 2018-02-07 20:19:59 Which oil company paid for this ad?
1808 2018-02-07 20:19:28 but DANGIT, i LIKE mania’s oil ocean!!!!!!!

1813 2018-02-07 20:18:59 I went to Dischem today for Tea trea oil and tissue.

I parted with R 700, I swear I had 5 items.
1814 2018-02-07 20:18:58 Some of us are missing the point here..  The militants rose because their homes were destroyed and nothing was done to repair it yet the oil was used to build other cities,  its quite different from these.  Fulani are just killing people just for the thrill of it.That's terrorism
1815 2018-02-07 20:18:42 Same over here, I believe. I have been burning the midnight oil a bit too frequently over the past few nights. Nothing wrong with getting a decent sleep as it is. Take care, Laura!

1820 2018-02-07 20:17:51 Ruling out the probability of end of the year oil rally, similar to 2017 dynamics ? 
bearishness at the start of the year as a result of anticipated supply increase  > less oil investments and growing economies > growing demand > end of year rally ..?

1825 2018-02-07 20:17:05 I have a used oil broiler that heats the floor heat in my shop. Yes buy a good one. They require semi-annual maintenance and cleaning. We also built a way to prefilter oil before it goes into the main tank. Filtered oil=Less problems
1826 2018-02-07 20:17:04 Mine are really bad too I use some dry healing ointment I found at Walmart anything like that helps and also when ur at home if u wash / scrub your hands with coconut oil mixed with sugar every day that’s helped me too

1848 2018-02-07 20:13:36 What I learned today:
1) I don't need to put THAT much coconut oil in my hair
2) I don't need to use THAT much shampoo to wash it out
3) Some shampoos burn eyes more than others
4) I can't use wife's oil or shampoo again without authorization and/or supervision
1849 2018-02-07 20:13:26 Might be from processed sugary foods, or dairy. You can try mixing tea tree oil and a little water and putting that on at night time, it really helps me.
1850 2018-02-07 20:13:20 What about oil change? Remember is every 3000 miles

1863 2018-02-07 20:12:17 So in the end the regs they reduced are often regs meant to save us oil clean up or printing OUR GOVT money to save economy/enviro. I feel pols reduce regs on donators not you & I. I sincerely appreciate our convo!! Till we meet again...

1875 2018-02-07 20:10:41 Ouch! We're so sorry to hear this, Lizzy. We always recommend applying this roll-on away from the eye area, however, if you ever do get a little in your eye, we suggest gently wiping with a soft cloth and vegetable oil. This should remove any essential oil from your eye!
1876 2018-02-07 20:10:33 Notley could care less how this plays out in BC. She is trying to appear strong to her own base, the oil base, and all of Alberta. Given that that's her objective, seems pretty slick to me. She knows the courts are on her side, she now is consolidating the court of public opinion

1881 2018-02-07 20:09:55 And remember the only real rise in core above target lately took - very cheap dollar, most expensive oil and the biggest credit boom of all time.   Go figure. @inflation_guy @Brynjo
1882 2018-02-07 20:09:54 2 Trump wants oil in return for the US to intervene. Libya needs weapons and can’t get with the current military sanctions. If Russia helps than that is a viable option .
1883 2018-02-07 20:09:52 DJT is right. Price of crude oil goes down...good news to purchasers of gasoline and other products,but its bad news for oil investors, which is why the value of oil stocks (the paper kind)  goes down.  Or "big company" announces layoffs; stock ticks up but workers are unemployed
1884 2018-02-07 20:09:37 I wonder who’s idea it was to put Diesel engine oil into a Subaru and find out it’s actually the best oil for it lol

Thank the politicians!! All of them.
1890 2018-02-07 20:09:06 Don’t disagree we have too many regs. My only problem is that politicians say ‘reduced regs’, so you, I & every biz owner imagine the reg that personally hate so we embrace it-and then they reduce regs for oil/banks that have caused biggest recession & oil spill in decades...
1891 2018-02-07 20:08:57 Delta 9 Is the best premium cannabis oil I have ever had in a vape! Expensive but worth it!! — feeling impressed

1894 2018-02-07 20:08:28 Canada has resource based economy & as a result higher unemployment rate. Loosing competitivnes due to carbon tax & higher corp. tax than US will drive comp.'s abroad. No need to *save* massive oil supplies they will outlive the country. Who can afford expensive solar? We R broke
1895 2018-02-07 20:08:23 Lucas Oil too, seem to be the prominent sponsor on #6
1896 2018-02-07 20:08:20 Baby arugula, fresh squeezed lemon, olive oil, salt, and fresh cracked pepper should be its own food group

1901 2018-02-07 20:07:37 Just Musk almost single handed forced the auto manufacturers to join him in the EV revolution, not to mention the energy markets and potential 'tube' travel. Personally I think all the trillions on oil subsidies should be re routed to his companies. Sod the Koch brothers.
1902 2018-02-07 20:07:37 The middle eastern oil dictatorships must be loving having us all fighting amongst ourselves. They want to sell their oil. At least Canada absorbs millions of tons of CO2 with our forest and food crops. They absorb nothing.
1903 2018-02-07 20:07:33 and yet you refuse to be held accountable in the event of a oil spill. Says everything about your confidence in industry.
1904 2018-02-07 20:07:30 Do your part, don't put gas in your car, turn on the heat in your house, take public transportation, use anything plastic,....
Don't act so pompous, We all contribute to the demand for oil...
1905 2018-02-07 20:07:16 Affect is a verb Effect is a noun get it straight people it’s not that hard. Pollution Affects the environment. Oil spills have a negative Effect on the ocean. There you go
1906 2018-02-07 20:06:54 I always find it ironic arguing with a Liberal about so called green house gases, oops I mean  the hole in the ozone oops I mean climate change on a device that is made from oil products. You are determined I’ll give you that.

1916 2018-02-07 20:05:12 California will not allow the federal government to transport oil using state waters or bring it ashore if new @POTUS offshore drilling plan is approved, according to CA Coastal Commission letter sent Wednesday to federal Bureau of Ocean Management.

1919 2018-02-07 20:04:46 Only downside being self employed is when you come down with cold or flu there is nothing you can do about it. And it always seems to happen when I have a big gig on. Only 25 senior Oil & gas execs to inspire Thurs/Fri. Just have to suck it up and get on with it.

1920 2018-02-07 20:04:44 and the oil market tanking. Venezuela operates under the capitalist system. Capitalism is a global system. It's all or nothing. Capitalism or socialism. You cannot have an island of socialism in a sea of capitalism. socialism is the complete transformation of social relations
1921 2018-02-07 20:04:39 I think a lot towards the end depends on stuff like snow days and your class and your teacher. I bet we got a rushed take on Watergate, Vietnam, The Oil Crisis, and the fall of Communism at the end.

1923 2018-02-07 20:04:35 @VinnieTortorich looking for a low sugar salad dressing. I sort of remember you talking about just olive oil?
1924 2018-02-07 20:04:17 Trump treated the hair on the back of his head like it was oil underneath a national park
1925 2018-02-07 20:04:17 I don't think there's an exact recipe for it. It's a fairly simple stir fry to make. Boil the pasta. Cook the chopped up spam with some oil + garlic/onion. Strain pasta and stir fry it with the spam/onions. Add soy sauce, salt and pepper, and a lil bit of sesame oil to taste. EZ
1926 2018-02-07 20:04:13 Go on, do explain. But also only use examples that are vegan only. So don't cheat and say palm oil, or pollination. TBH I'm interested in ducks though.

1931 2018-02-07 20:03:31 Estuvo Rebotando 0.8%, pero el OIL se cayó
1932 2018-02-07 20:02:58 Great to see. Move all the licences into state owenership so no one can sell oil for £5 or destroy shareholder value (Premier); instead drive investments into the €6bn a year renewables sector as that's 60,000 jobs. Well done Grace & all. Good x-party delivering community wants

1936 2018-02-07 20:02:22 Its reality because hinduism is not monolithic. Thats why westeen definition of religion dont fit it.

South asian and south east asian version of islam was also tolerant compared to wahabbi version but now oil dollars resulting into wahabbism.
1937 2018-02-07 20:02:02 We didn't run out of oil yet, so we never will? Don't bother planning for the diminishing reserves of a nonrenewable energy source? Sound logic!
1938 2018-02-07 20:01:59 Is your mom willing to partake in a trade? My whole family bringing yam, goat , oil and money inside envelope with me prostrating like soldier is beating me just so you can come and be my lifetime ikokore woman?
1939 2018-02-07 20:01:46 Strange. Dreamers on back burner?
1940 2018-02-07 20:01:44 As far as examples of socialism working in the modern era I cannot point you towards a success. The fact that capitalism is around means attempts have failed. Venezuela often what the right points to. But the problem with venezuela is corruption and the over-dependence on oil

1949 2018-02-07 20:01:08 If Trump's energy policy has hurt Russia by lowering oil prices, there is limited evidence of this, and moreover by us backing out of TPP Russia and China are guaranteed a larger bite at the future apple when it comes to markets.
1950 2018-02-07 20:00:59 And those anti renewables are in the pockets of big oil helping the 1% get richer. Causing pollution and destroying the only planet we have.

Comey reminds me of a 72 pinto.
2018 2018-02-07 19:57:14 @KatyTurNBC  Thanks for reporting on today's wages. Just like the Bush tax cuts, as soon as working people have more money, oil prices rise. So extra money going to working people just gets turned over to oil companies - again! So wrong!
2019 2018-02-07 19:57:09 Restocked on jojoba oil 
2020 2018-02-07 19:57:00 No problem you can block our oil and we will block products from bc...fair is fair
2021 2018-02-07 19:56:59 I gotta get this oil change TODAY 
2022 2018-02-07 19:56:28 Get into class and realize my jeans are covered in brake fluid and motor oil, fantastic day so far
2023 2018-02-07 19:56:21 A Cambridge oil painter who works on a large scale is @JoTunmer She does commissions. Def worth a look.
2024 2018-02-07 19:56:07 Beard oil came in today 
2025 2018-02-07 19:55:56 There is no such thing as clean burning oil or coal. With that logic, the US is number one in production of golden goose eggs and magic beans too.
2026 2018-02-07 19:55:51 Of course not!
Two reasons!
1. Trump
2. Oil
2027 2018-02-07 19:55:44 no bc then you’ll get fined for the oil spill of cstat and then pay an extra $1000!!!:)))
2028 2018-02-07 19:55:33 You want some essential oil rollerballs?
2029 2018-02-07 19:55:31 Hope it was olive oil, it's healthier
2030 2018-02-07 19:55:26 Just saw a post on Instagram about swapping your coffee cream with coconut oil, the "healthy alternative", and I physically gagged
2031 2018-02-07 19:55:25 That may be the first time I have see someone say that fossil fuels were the cure ... and all uppercase... the major oil companies don’t even believe that ... in fact corporate America is committed to meeting the Paris Accord targets regardless of Trump ..
2032 2018-02-07 19:55:12 A rambunctious band of oil drillers?
2033 2018-02-07 19:55:09 @MCaruso_Cabrera @SullyCNBC #WTI #Oil drop seems overdone. After wks of drawdowns, not surprise to see small built & its a draw vs last wk!, production is matching demand, #OPEC still in play, risk is upside, seems to be just one shock from high 60s
2034 2018-02-07 19:55:06 What?!? European countries recognized the threat, and took action! But they have intelligent, experienced people who do not wish to bow to Putin. Or buy his oil
2035 2018-02-07 19:55:02 Sorry Rob but you’ve got it backwards. It was always called tar sands. The term oil sands was introduced by the industry for the sole purpose of greenwashing. Every geologist I know over the age of 55 calls it tar sands.
2036 2018-02-07 19:54:57 710.77345 spelled out SHELL'OIL upside down.
2037 2018-02-07 19:54:51 i put tea tree oil in my bong water
2038 2018-02-07 19:54:50 Our economy distributes resources unevenly—they essentially all go to the top, in greater quantities into fewer hands. If we’re going to force the masses into exploitation, we really should at least subsidize life necessities and not just war and oil.
2039 2018-02-07 19:54:48 why doesn't Alberta oil go through Ontario & Quebec to the east coast where it's wanted? Just askin'! #abpoli #bcpoli
2040 2018-02-07 19:54:46 ok.... just got back from haircut. bought another hair oil treatment. will anything show me results? let's find out
2041 2018-02-07 19:54:20 Bro u got some serious issues and speaking Dotard language. Put all aside for a minute, explain what is Clean Oil and Coal first??
2042 2018-02-07 19:54:09 As usual, you miss the point entirely. Because of the way the US and coalition forces have acted (bombing countries for oil & resources) those countries see us as terrorists! 

Yes there are good and bad Muslims, just as there are good and bad (@JimMolan, you) Australians 
2043 2018-02-07 19:54:05 I enjoyed the first 2 episodes. While the “water & oil” dynamic could have been the entertaining route to go, my interpretation is that the program wants to be motivating/positive/uplifting as opposed to being controversial. Glad things ended with no beef!
2044 2018-02-07 19:53:46 They won’t be when their reward if they win is a trip to the sand pit of the Crown Oil Arena.
2045 2018-02-07 19:53:43 me: there's a pretty gray GT Mustang on the showroom floor, race car sea-
dad: get your oil changed and leave 

I did this to myself
2046 2018-02-07 19:53:42 Not only has German engineering ensured my car breaks down at least 3 times a year, but also that my car needs full synthetic oil to cost me a whopping $70 for an oil change. Well, at least they’ve made sure its malfunctions are in fashionable taste — HOW KIND
2047 2018-02-07 19:53:41 Where is Trudeau in the pipeline dispute between AB & BC Why has he not intervened Who is he scared of To many jobs and livelihoods depend on this pipe being laid and operated Also where are the voices of the people who work in the oil sands and live in BC? I would be mad as hell
2048 2018-02-07 19:53:37 SON UNAS RATAS
2049 2018-02-07 19:53:34 It isn't the pipeline we here in bc are disputing the safety of, it's the increased oil tanker traffic through the inside passage and the Juan de Fuca straight. These can be dangerous waters and an oil spill would be disastrous to the bc landscape. Fully support Horgan!

2052 2018-02-07 19:53:06 U.S. crude oil production is set to increase by more than 1.2 million barrels per day in 2018 compared with 2017, according to the latest short-term forecasts from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. @StephenPunwasi @FIVRE604
2053 2018-02-07 19:53:02 Haha, vegetable oil,i ACCIDENTALLY, honest, spilt there near pool,mwah, mwahaha 
2054 2018-02-07 19:52:50 I have a spray with a lot of coconut oil in it that I rely on. Now am in my mid to late 40s am aware I need to put effort into ensuring my hair doesn't become dry
2055 2018-02-07 19:52:50 "Oil left in the ground does not reduce CO2"

Thats too stupid to respond to.
2056 2018-02-07 19:52:35 في سياق حديث لرسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم....
2057 2018-02-07 19:52:32 I think that's a part of market evolution. I love @cburniske 's classification of cryptocurrencies and cryptocommodities and it makes a lot of sense that they should co-exist and have the same relationship as dollar and oil. They both have an important role in the market.
2058 2018-02-07 19:52:31 The same thing that happens in countries that don’t get rain for months at a time. When it finally does rain all the built-up oil simmers up and turns the roads into slides
2059 2018-02-07 19:52:24 Well if Alberta decides to stop supplying gas.. it's time to get electric cars  

We do have Hydro power 

and solar power and biodiesel.. cooking oil... etc

It would only force us to evolve a bit faster.

Kicking off at about 9pm                           Playing Rhythm and Blues, Rock and Roll and a bit of punk. All welcome.

2062 2018-02-07 19:51:53 Uh, let’s see, if I was an oil company I would put all that excess into searching for and producing new and better product/results. Why don’t you do that instead of giving to the already super wealthy?
2063 2018-02-07 19:51:52 I’m currently in a coconut oil bath with a face mask on and a candle lit I’m LIVING
2064 2018-02-07 19:51:52 Similar story with asphalt roads. They are slickest during a drizzle, when there's enough water to induce an ever so slight layer of oil atop the surface but not enough to wash it off the roadway
2065 2018-02-07 19:51:50 How have a lived so long on this earth without using coconut oil until today. Absolute god sent! 
2066 2018-02-07 19:51:49 Sports teams get lavish parades. Military is not worthy?
2067 2018-02-07 19:51:48 Hi, thanks for your question. I really don't know much about the biofuel/ethanol market, and tend to stick to what I do know - oil & gas. So, any opinion I would have on the matter would be entirely ignorant and speculative!
2068 2018-02-07 19:51:47 those "investors", nothing slows them down.  not even record US oil production growth.
2069 2018-02-07 19:51:41 Oil stalls out. I'd like to see a little more short covering there, before that market closes - in 9 min.
2070 2018-02-07 19:51:36 i’m a millennial i eat avocado and cantaloupe for every meal and brush my teeth with luke-warm and unrefined coconut oil
2071 2018-02-07 19:51:25 Another woman recruited by islamischer stat why don´t yu go have a look around do you think oil is private?
2072 2018-02-07 19:51:22 Lease wrap investment programs allow the land owner to invest in currency, businesses & other markets.  It's basically a loan against future earnings from the company who extract the oil.

Sadly, the holdings & investment companies take large equity stakes from the landowner.
2073 2018-02-07 19:51:15 Rapsöl! In the US it's called canola oil. That sounds so awesome!
2074 2018-02-07 19:51:07 Shower/oil is too difficult to capture in pics - although would probably make good vids for the website. Backgrounds do matter as you can get creative with outfits such as daisy dukes, a tight vest/crop top that show off the cleavage and boots/killer heels.
2075 2018-02-07 19:51:06 U hv nt eaten Yam & Oil b4? hmm. khloe .. khloe?  Bt u hv seen Roasted plantain? D pple roasting d plantain dey roast yam too na? #BBNaija
2076 2018-02-07 19:51:03 From bankruptcy to giving unlimited amounts of money, Huh? Don't worry an unknown number of ppl will move to Stockton so oil those printing presses
2077 2018-02-07 19:51:03 @simplynessa15 you should put coconut oil on your head, it’s good for hair
2078 2018-02-07 19:50:48 Went out to put oil in my car and saw a little squirrel carrying a gigantic orange! It still had the sticker on it! Where are you stealing fruit from ya little thief!
2079 2018-02-07 19:50:47 I sure hope this oil change don’t take forever
2080 2018-02-07 19:50:42 Hmmmmm the multi benefit skin oil interests me I like Murad I’ll have to give that a go
2081 2018-02-07 19:50:12 really gotta walk in the oil change spot and let em know .. i want an oil change and THATS IT !!
2082 2018-02-07 19:50:09 Another Voter fraud commission bulkrap..States will block this oil scam as well
2083 2018-02-07 19:49:47 It's incredible. Totally detached from the price of oil.
2084 2018-02-07 19:49:38 3rd year has been the best year so far, GDFS gaining work experience, best grades yet at uni! No longer on antidepressants and just got chosen to do a huge project in a group with marathon oil and getting more work experience in abz! Stay positive cause things DO get better 
2085 2018-02-07 19:49:31 i need to get an oil change on my car but it’s so cold outside :///
2086 2018-02-07 19:49:13 OIL getting slammed today. Jeepers.
2087 2018-02-07 19:49:11 "if this interpretation had been in place after the Gulf oil spill, BP would have been off the hook for killing one million birds & would not have been required to pay a $100 million fine that is helping restore bird habitat."
2088 2018-02-07 19:49:10 Not an F’ing chance.  ‘Peoplekind’ have no hope ’
2089 2018-02-07 19:49:07 US crude oil futures settle at $61.79. Tests key support.  Down -$1.60 or -2.52% on the day
US crude oil inventories rose by nearly 2M barrels today. That was much higher than the private API data that showed a draw of nearly -1.1M yesterday.
2090 2018-02-07 19:49:00 < #油song の曲目から、中の人が主に誰のペンか想像がつくと思います…ふふっ
2091 2018-02-07 19:48:49 Why. ? He just like the oil stock price goes up so he gets millions ???
2092 2018-02-07 19:48:44 Misinforming shareholders. Misinforming the public. The truth is that oil burning cannot continue. Either it wrecks the stability of the system upon which the economies of oil extraction rely or it's halted because the public becomes outraged at the harms done.
2093 2018-02-07 19:48:35 Mar A Lago is in Florida - they get all the money AND no offshore oil drilling. Right @marcorubio ?
2094 2018-02-07 19:48:27 For shiny hair, mix one egg with a olive oil and apply to your hair. Leave it on for 20-30 minutes then shower.
2095 2018-02-07 19:48:23 I’m sure they won’t mind but I don’t want to ask for too much. They already pay for my gas, fast trak and half of my oil change.
2096 2018-02-07 19:48:20 I actually LOVE olaplex! I was trying different things to help with keeping my hair conditioned as well as helping it grow faster lol.i take biotin and folic acid supplements and use castor oil conditioners too
2097 2018-02-07 19:48:15 @MielleOrganics has this almond and mint oil that I’ve been using in my hair under this weave and OH MY GOD it is life.
2098 2018-02-07 19:48:15 Mine needs an oil change and tire rotation too. Must see if I could get my wife to do it. Nah probably not.
2099 2018-02-07 19:48:14 Half naked chicks wrestling each other, that'll show us. They should really stick it to us and throw some oil or mud or jello in there.
2100 2018-02-07 19:48:09 Not so soon Grant, not so soon... IMHO. They're going to crash the market and gold and oil to keep money flowing to bonds...
2101 2018-02-07 19:48:05 @GordonRamsay do you reckon Jamie Oliver uses olive oil when making babies??
2102 2018-02-07 19:48:03 Never, ever, ever use soap.
After scrubbing put on burner on low to drie it then rub oil into it cool and put away
2103 2018-02-07 19:47:56 After an hour wait for an oil change, dude tells me I haven't reached my mile limit yet and asks if i still want it. Yeah, I think after waiting that long I've decided 10 more minutes is just too much more.
2104 2018-02-07 19:47:55 Tell me due to this speech, will it bring jobs, stop communal violence, economy issue, oil price , gst etc... these are all gimmicks..he is PM of one of the biggest nation and liable to behave and talk keeping that in mind..
2105 2018-02-07 19:47:11 A foundation that is FULL coverage 24 hours doesn't BUDGE once set oil proof water proof and actually matches my skin
2106 2018-02-07 19:47:04 House mates are forming as if they have not eating roasted yam with palm oil before
2107 2018-02-07 19:46:48 Pfft. Who came up with the idea of putting coconut oil on your face ? 
2108 2018-02-07 19:46:29 I’ve also read about so many children who are now seizure free. My sister had an operation to rid her of seizures. Now she doesn’t get jokes. She’s not my sister.I wish I could back up time and she would have been able to try the oil. God bless you & your sister & nieces.
2109 2018-02-07 19:46:26 I always buy it in Maryland with that palm oil sauce. Them just dey lie.
2110 2018-02-07 19:46:25 Highly upset I can’t find my oil change coupon
2111 2018-02-07 19:46:19 @BBNaijaTv Kbrule wtf did u just do? drinking oil with spoon?
2112 2018-02-07 19:46:18 Hasn’t every dog owner been there at some point? I had it happen as a kid, my staffie pulled me across concrete. If it’s wet, muddy, slicker than a floor covered in Vaseline and oil...spills are bound to happen. At least the dog got a fair workout 
2113 2018-02-07 19:46:18 So oil and being more capitalist is why their socialized healthcare system works better? 
2114 2018-02-07 19:46:16 God please send me a man who rubs coconut oil on my scalp while smokin loud listening to Marvin Gaye and talking about our philosophies about life, love, and Insecure.
2115 2018-02-07 19:46:13 Sunday should be so much better. Their UFO oil has helped with my acne and dry skin.  F praying on people's insecurities.
2116 2018-02-07 19:46:06 they smell the same? i don’t know! it’s just what tea tree oil reminds me of. shitty high school coke.
2117 2018-02-07 19:45:56 1.) Why would you continue to use a fabric that is known to show oil and "dirt" 2.) I paid ~$300 for this jacket to have to constantly wash just from daily wear???? BECAUSE I USE LOTION!?!?!??!
2118 2018-02-07 19:45:48 And the oil that fills that us refinery...comes from the pipeline!
2119 2018-02-07 19:45:47 Oil crashing, industrial metals crashing, dollar up, yields up.  Gonna work out great!
2120 2018-02-07 19:45:45 True drop in oil in transit + ST storage has freed up 200MMbl of tanker capacity.
2121 2018-02-07 19:45:40 Thanks be fair that is tricky because economics can change. They may find oil under Dundee!
2122 2018-02-07 19:45:23 Forgot I had a cute bra in the front seat of my car when I came to get an oil change so you’re welcome to the dude who got to drive me car into the bay
2123 2018-02-07 19:45:12 All oil has unique profile that identifies its source....
The real question is why would #California shoot itself in the economic foot..? So they give the profits and jobs to other states..?
2124 2018-02-07 19:45:04 $XOP back to October levels.... when oil was $54 or so; industry is hated and frankly some of it is well-deserved due to lack of focus on returns on capital and bad mgmt incentives.
2125 2018-02-07 19:44:56 YOU JUST HAVE TO CHANGE THE WAY YOU CHARGE US IN RHODE ISLAND THE BOOKING FEE IS 2.10 CENTS PLUS 25 PURCENT UBER COMISION AND US THE DRIVERS GET PAID 9 DOLLARS FOR OVER 20 MINUTES RIDE WHEN WE SPEND GAS CLEANING CARS OIL SERVICE ETC PLUS DRIVING IN BIG TRAFFIC ITS TIME FOCHANGE
2126 2018-02-07 19:44:45 It would be the #Oilers way to give him 3 yrs at 4.5M and a NTC.
2127 2018-02-07 19:44:41 Agree with Sabs! It really clears up my brothers Eczema. Or try coconut oil, that’s really good too x
2128 2018-02-07 19:44:34 So we know we have oil. Lot of opinions on that. No, I'm not reading all the stuff you're posting – sorry. Rogers Trading, 'England will not survive its debt obligations without Scotland's oil'.
2129 2018-02-07 19:44:30 This the last oil change , tire change, any change I’m doing to the whip after this it’s murder she wrote for’r....
2130 2018-02-07 19:44:25 They should consider putting a traffic light at that forte oil/Ebeano junction in Lekki 1.
2131 2018-02-07 19:44:18 BBN Naija too much oil princess nah
2132 2018-02-07 19:44:10 Better to get oil from the middle east so they can use California’s money to help terrorists kill Americans
2133 2018-02-07 19:44:09 Construction projects take years. By the time the pipeline is built, oil will be back down to $10 and oil sands will be unviable. BC is actually going Alberta a favour
2134 2018-02-07 19:44:02 Accidentally let the oil tank dip dangerously low, and right before a good storm too. Rushed delivery was an extra $100 (+cost of fuel!), but now my pipes nor tenants nor their chinchillas will freeze. Expensive mistake. #adventuresinlandlording

2138 2018-02-07 19:43:34 Currently getting a complimentary massage while I get my oil change... Boca
2139 2018-02-07 19:43:29 Process is getting more pimples on her face. Please stop taking too much oil. #BBNaija
2140 2018-02-07 19:43:27 This oil change about to take forever 
2141 2018-02-07 19:43:27 Milky suggested we try some food in Cars land bit I thought they used way too much oil.  

:D
2142 2018-02-07 19:43:18 tea tree oil reminds me of bad cocaine. bye!

wok-charred venison stinging nettle. . .10
sauteed caviar and four-truffle oil swordfish. . .29
2145 2018-02-07 19:43:00 Not to mention that oil will float to the top of the soil. Unlike the raw sewage that Van and Vic pump into the ocean..
2146 2018-02-07 19:42:45 Not even cooking oil comes in bottles like that, surely?
2147 2018-02-07 19:42:37 Our advanced technologies have made us very efficient = productive. Would be nice if oil advocates would back off the criticism of green energy and work together- you ship yours and be sure manufacturing and trucking is covered. We don't need to kiss of 23000 jobs-like mine!
2148 2018-02-07 19:42:26 Oil change, tire rotation, now he's vacuuming and things. And changing air filters
2149 2018-02-07 19:42:22 Oil prices log lowest settlement in 4 weeks
2150 2018-02-07 19:42:22 Pass it. The cost to remove all leverage from dems on immigration is worth it. 
What do they have left to hold hostage but Dreamers ?
2151 2018-02-07 19:42:17 Agreed.  When the counter trend rally ends I reload on oil and gold & metals.  Also I will wait for VIX to calm down < 20.
2152 2018-02-07 19:42:14 Yes @RealQueenSimren well said.  Ye jo feku modi hai o Sala jo krim or oil lagata the sab Congress ke 70saal kiya diya
2153 2018-02-07 19:42:10 Europe at least is in hock to the Saudis who give cheap oil in exchange for unlimited Islamic immigration and protection for its customs and mores on pain of prosecution for Hate Crime
2154 2018-02-07 19:41:45 Uh....that's creepy.
2155 2018-02-07 19:41:09 السلام عليكم. وياهلا بالهاشمي

2157 2018-02-07 19:40:50 Overlooking the fact that the oil creates several poisons toxic to humans at high temps. This is bs.
2158 2018-02-07 19:40:45 Sounds like my standard practice - argan oil is about as exotic as I get.
2159 2018-02-07 19:40:44 Coconut oil + coffee.

2162 2018-02-07 19:40:33 I mean what else can the company do? There is no easy way to lay people off, but it is a reality - especially in Oil & Gas.
2163 2018-02-07 19:40:25 Sorry, President Trump rolled back what Obummer put into place that stifling oil independence, limiting jobs, and marking America move venerable to oil embargo! I applaud his actions! He is #MAGA

2171 2018-02-07 19:39:41 Joke: essential oils
Woke: chrism oil
Bespoke: chrism uses essential oils

Only half kidding. On the joke part. Says the aromatherapist-in-training.
2172 2018-02-07 19:39:30 No one is stopping any of these people from enjoying these lands. You held no public comment for these areas. Trying to pad the pocket book of your resource extraction (big oil and mineral companies) buddies is nothing but cronyism. Try talking to Montana citizens, not donors!
2173 2018-02-07 19:39:28 So why can't Alberta (and the rest of Canada) refine and distribute our oil again? Why can't we fully produce and sell our own product? We don't ship our grapes to China for them to ferment then turn around and sell back to us.
2174 2018-02-07 19:39:25 We dont drink minyak. We drink air. We need water more than we need oil.
2175 2018-02-07 19:39:25 Haha love a bit of oil don't I or a bottle  I am appreciating ur look tho looking very sleek 
2176 2018-02-07 19:39:24 do you have eggs and oil
2177 2018-02-07 19:39:16 US breakevens not quite keeping pace with the sell-off in nominal yields (oil related), thus the 10yr real treasury yield sits at 71bp and the highest since 26 Jan 2016...USD bulls will be somewhat enthused at the underperformance in 30yr too
2178 2018-02-07 19:39:13 oil production drops -> prices rise

2180 2018-02-07 19:39:10 There are so many dolts out there that think this is a pipeline issue, a safer way to get oil to market instead of rail?? Ah no, they have not read the implications of increased flow of oil & 7 fold increase of tanker traffic in BC coastal waters~ Can't educate some people.
2181 2018-02-07 19:38:58 Is this oil that these people are eating? #BBNaija
2182 2018-02-07 19:38:48 شكراً  وماتكلف شيء ههههههه

2184 2018-02-07 19:38:45 he doesn’t give two shits about any person besides his family,#Flint is a total disgrace, BP left 10,000,000 gallons of oil in the gulf of Mexico,drilling all around the country except in front of his house in Florida,selling uranium to Russia, from the #Grand Canyon,& fracking,!
2185 2018-02-07 19:38:39 This week’s domestic crude oil production estimate incorporates a re-benchmarking that raised estimated volumes by 280,000 barrels per day, which is 2.7% of this week’s estimated production total. -EIA #OOTT

2187 2018-02-07 19:38:26 Truffle oil bangs!
2188 2018-02-07 19:38:13 Why cling to a sinking ship?
So the car industry goes, so does the economy.
We need to unhinge our economy from cars and oil.
Subsidies for taxes/profits, so a few citizens can have jobs? Sounds like welfare.
If they don't see a value in our country, then let them go. #ontpoli
2189 2018-02-07 19:38:00 honestly! we need to get a move on on implementing cleaner energy. let AB focus on that so that we can all have a healthy economy w/out ruining our land and oceans w/ oil

2191 2018-02-07 19:37:32 It is Aberdeen, if the picture hadn’t been cropped you would see oil rigs to the right. 
2192 2018-02-07 19:37:27 Actually no-one has any idea what the oil is worth. What do the Treasury make from it at the moment. However, many opinions out there and I tend to think that there's a reason why UK Government so desperate to hang onto Scotland. When apparently we are a drain?
2193 2018-02-07 19:37:21 Most of them also have some pretty significant debt issues. My elves tell me oil will hit $75/bbl soon and level off. That should help...
2194 2018-02-07 19:37:19 sorry Kbrule just manage and eat whatever they give you...yam & red oil..... #bbnaija
2195 2018-02-07 19:37:17 @edhollett Problem for OPEC to keep it's own people happy and capture oil revenue at the same time...That's why I doubt they'd act...
2196 2018-02-07 19:37:17 But do you know most of the soy that is fed to animals is a by product of extracting soy oil for human consumption of course you do, but you wouldn't tell ppl.
2197 2018-02-07 19:37:11 “The scent of suntan oil, broiled hotdogs and spilled beer create a wondrous feeling of euphoria and feeling that neither crowds, hard benches, long ticket lines or the endless trek to distant toilets can diminish..

2202 2018-02-07 19:36:52 Caroline plans on buying cannabis oil to stop me from smoking.
2203 2018-02-07 19:36:52 that's the tragedy, exactly! I think people know quite well Musk is kind of a snake oil salesman but they just love that at least something is happening. Which says a lot about our current social dynamics and how we use technology...
2204 2018-02-07 19:36:51 Today big move down in $Oil and higher US Dollar Index should reduce higher inflation worry for now and stabilise the 10y year around 2.8

2207 2018-02-07 19:36:35 You're talking about fantasyland ... no way this Liberal govt will EVER fight for pipelines/oil resources out west the way they do with their beloved Bombardier.

2211 2018-02-07 19:36:10 Who do you think works in Alberta’s oil fields? It’s small businesses and families. The BC illegal blockade landlocks Canadian resources, which sales benefit ALL Canadians #cndpoli
2212 2018-02-07 19:36:10 A cbs journalists asked them both a question... if Jamaica is prepared to not take Venezuela oil and if US can fill the gap
2213 2018-02-07 19:36:00 How much dental work do I wanna get done? I think just some new fake enamel up front. I need to find the hash oil man in the metro.
2214 2018-02-07 19:35:49 Maybe the electric car, maybe the offshore crude oil or the lime, maybe the church they are getting too familiar over that the owner now look like a stranger to steal the show like the bandit that they are, kindly go back to when all this began.
2215 2018-02-07 19:35:47 while they smile to their hangars.

the one that makes me go mad is the fact that churches sell "anointing oil" and "holy water"
2216 2018-02-07 19:35:42 Hi Toni, we're sorry to hear you're seeing oil show up on your jacket. The lightweight fabric can show oils and dirt from your skin. A send through the wash will clean it right up. Make sure to use a Down Wash and dry thoroughly with 2 clean tennis balls (no fabric softeners)

2226 2018-02-07 19:35:04 There's currently more jobs in green energy than oil and gas put together.  Try actual research rather than spouting BS.
2227 2018-02-07 19:35:02 Amazing how resilient the spec longs in CAD are especially:
- as oil prices and energy stocks keep rolling over, 
- the Fed hiking rates, 
- Cdn real estate rolling over, 
- broader market volatility picking up.

2232 2018-02-07 19:34:44 I guess Putin doesn't care who keeps the area in chaos as long as there is no way of building new gas pipeline from Persian gulf to Turkey and Europe. If he can also disrupt any oil production in the area he is all for it.
He also needs his based for his mischief.

2243 2018-02-07 19:33:57 My great-great-grandfather bought what became Signal Hill sight unseen in Idaho to raise sheep. After he arrived, he saw that the land was useless for grazing and traded the land for a worthless Nevada gold mine. A year or so later, oil was discovered.
2244 2018-02-07 19:33:53 Our shop at work heats off of used oil, pretty slick
2245 2018-02-07 19:33:49 Shame on PMB.
Inspite of increase in oil prices, the suffering lingers on while presidential aids are scampering for "so called"recovered loots.

A case in hand is the recent revelation by the immediate past DG of NIA on Babagana Kingibi's quest for the $44million Ikoyigate money
2246 2018-02-07 19:33:49 well i'm glad you're not in any position of power. you literally threatened actual war over pipeline and oil from a foreign country. you're almost as bad as clinton.

2258 2018-02-07 19:32:59 HMG Economic impact studies show it will be Back To The 80s in all those regions most affected by Thatcherism (only without the oil). NE, NW, WM, Wales, NI should begin to recover by the 2040s and be back to where they are now by the 2060s. Plus job losses caused by robotics 
2259 2018-02-07 19:32:54 Big Oil has it’s tentacles deep in the government AND oil is integral to the way that Oklahoma has long seen itself.

Soon after the land run, oil was discovered and there was a run on it for most of the 20th century. In the 21st C though, most of those fields are played out.
2260 2018-02-07 19:32:51 if this is all oil has to fall , it's encouraging for bullz no?

2287 2018-02-07 19:29:51 Im sure they’ll do nothing but continue to extract every last bit of oil from the ground. Once gone, the oil companies will abandon the province and all the workers will end up in either the unemployment line or in another province
2288 2018-02-07 19:29:46 feeling pretty dangerous out there....

2289 2018-02-07 19:29:29 I've never understood why OK citizens tolerated the invisible tax they pay for cracking - all the damage they pay for from mini earthquakes, not passed on to oil cos.
2290 2018-02-07 19:29:28 Weird how the actual impact of drilling is minor compared to the fact THAT YOU ARE DRILLING FOR OIL. Why are we even still trying to expand that industry? We know it's harmful in various ways, we knows it's finite, why don't we set up a kinetic wave power plant instead?

Nothing has changed since the #ExxonValdez horror show which destroyed #PrinceWilliamSound. #Sanchi - a double-hulled tanker - is currently vomiting ONE MILLION GALLONS of oil into the East #China sea! #SalishSea is NOT #BigOil's dumping ground!
2294 2018-02-07 19:29:12 Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise them up. If they have sinned, they will be forgiven
2295 2018-02-07 19:29:09 Lol it was whatever massage oil they used. Never again
2296 2018-02-07 19:29:09 @JustinTrudeau @RuddKim @Kathleen_Wynne @LouRinaldiMPP  it amazes me how oil companies can continue price collusion and raise prices 13 cents at one time and not one elected official ever voices concern.  Gas is as vital as food when mass transit is lacking in most of Canada
2297 2018-02-07 19:29:05 Tonight’s Grilled Pizza of the Day:
Italian Sausage, Caramelized Onion, Wild Mushrooms, Fontina Cheese, Olive Oil Base $14
2298 2018-02-07 19:29:03 He will make more money to continue giving aid and comfort to the oil industry than he will at his short time as head of EPA (as he did in OK). It’s about the money.

2301 2018-02-07 19:28:57 Looks like she stepped in an olive oil puddle.
2302 2018-02-07 19:28:48 Weird thing is - there isn't ANY oil off the coast of Oregon. Why would you drill where there isn't any oil?
2303 2018-02-07 19:28:42 "It's when you strip down, oil up, and grapple bare-handed with one of your buds in a platonic demonstration of physical strength."
2304 2018-02-07 19:28:39 Hi @AliYoungBeauty. We were wondering if you'd had the chance to try our fabulous 100% Pure Prickly Pear Seed Oil yet!? Looking forward to hearing from you 
2305 2018-02-07 19:28:35 I’ve been informed a large oil company is increasing employee bonuses from 8k to 15k for all workers.  What say U Pelosi?? Crumbs? @realDonaldTrump @newtgingrich @WildmanTy @AandGShow #TaxCutsandJobsAct #Crumbs
2306 2018-02-07 19:28:24 They need an extra Pipeline- one for oil the other for wine.
2307 2018-02-07 19:28:22 WAS KAIRI AN OIL PRINCE THIS WHOLE TIME
2308 2018-02-07 19:28:17 Lady in my department can crank her oil diffuser in the office but I can’t VAPE at my desk?! WTF?!
2309 2018-02-07 19:28:15 Modern day Snake Oil Salesmen.
2310 2018-02-07 19:28:14 They have like one or two different ingredients. Purple has lavender & the orange doesn’t have lavender but has hemp oil & tea tree. I guess you gotta get what best works for your skin. 
2311 2018-02-07 19:28:14 Just downloaded the Sustainable Palm Oil app by @CheyenneMtnZoo, such a great initiative! So glad Cheez-Its are made with sustainable palm oil! 
2312 2018-02-07 19:28:14 If I was in this house,  I would  have starved to death . I don't  mess with my healthy eating. Look at all that red oil. I got physically  sick just looking at it.  *shivers** #BBNaija
2313 2018-02-07 19:28:10 So I don’t need synthetic oil 
2314 2018-02-07 19:28:02 vitamins a, c and e are great for the skin. if you are on a budget, take supplements, but if you have extra money to afford pricier skincare, murad makes a phenomenal multi-benefit oil, and the algenist genius vitamin c serum is 
2315 2018-02-07 19:27:55 If you work in the oil and gas industry, stainless steel nameplates are the perfect choice to withstand the harsh environment.
2316 2018-02-07 19:27:51 Venezuela is a monoeconomy. One export/commodity/industry. Oil. All monoeconomies fail eventually Communist or Capitalist.
2317 2018-02-07 19:27:48 If you drive a lifted diesel and don't do your own oil change I'm judgin
2318 2018-02-07 19:27:43 More so than oil, I guess.
2319 2018-02-07 19:27:36 Tom I appreciate your conciliatory tone - but I am called racist, Brexit MPs have been called jihadis by Claire Perry  & 'snake oil salesmen' by GoD. Brextremist is another disgraceful term- hope you see it isn't one sided
2320 2018-02-07 19:27:30 Oil industry in the shitter and looking for someone else to blame.
2321 2018-02-07 19:27:26 I love waiting a long time for an oil change 
2322 2018-02-07 19:27:22 Princess scooping oil for roasted yam into plates like its soup....lmao they will all remain the oil and bitto the kitchen boy ends up washing them off with liquid wash! #bbnaija
2323 2018-02-07 19:27:09 So you would rather remain dependent on foreign oil?   I see where your localities are
2324 2018-02-07 19:27:06 I’m no oil painting, far from it, but imagine going on that celebs go dating show and getting paired up with Gemma Collins.
2325 2018-02-07 19:26:53 I want a next plate of oil down
2326 2018-02-07 19:26:44 Coming from Alberta,I have now evolved into a fully fledged tree hugger.Oil can always be moved safely to the coast,the coast ,once damaged,is gone forever.
2327 2018-02-07 19:26:38 Also, the governor and state legislature are horrible at governing and are slavishly intent upon supporting the dying oil industry instead of being smart & welcoming alternative fuels and energy options. 

OK has a lot of fallow farmland that could house solar farms.
2328 2018-02-07 19:26:37 Swarms of them have started reappearing strangely since the oil price got near $70 a barrel
2329 2018-02-07 19:26:33 I guess since cannabidiol hemp oil is only 3 words, Dustin couldn't use that? Sovereign Citizen is only 2 words. How about CBD Oil, Sovereign Citizen?
2330 2018-02-07 19:26:25 Since you work for a powerful network like NBC, will any one of you be asking Rex Tillerson if Exxon (and all other oil companies) are now openly doing business with Russia since Trump refuses to implement the sanctions? Did Tillerson ever sell all his Exxon stock, by the way?
2331 2018-02-07 19:26:21 Alright T Boone Pickens ,where's that peak oil now that we're (US) pushing 10 mill barrels a day
2332 2018-02-07 19:26:20 #skincaretip applying harsh ingredients like alcohol to oily skin actually has the opposite effect. As a reaction to the drying ingredient, the skin increases oil production as part of its healing and balancing processes. Stick with alcohol free products and stay moisturized!
2333 2018-02-07 19:25:53 I did, I've taken a few close people there. I really think you'll like it. They have a little bit of everything, from books to crystals to oil scent etc, recommend you go check it out (: plus a block down from there is little Saigon & you know they have good pho there!

2337 2018-02-07 19:25:32 @VinnieTortorich can you suggest a good way to get iodine in your body, I thought it was in salt but just like the olive oil industry that's a lie also, thanks Vinnie! #NSNG

2339 2018-02-07 19:25:17 No more German cars  french cheese , Spanish fruit and veg , Italian olive oil or even it's wine German tractors ploughs seeding planters , bloody rubbish
2340 2018-02-07 19:25:15 And where were the extremists and hardliners before America invaded Iraq.?Invasion in the name of democracy turned out to be a way of stealing oil. The chaos created by the invasion only allowed extremists to find ground in Iraq
2341 2018-02-07 19:25:09 Yeah that 1 time bonus of 200-1000 that is heavily taxed is a life changer! I mean it's no yearly 500k kickback, but think of that one thing I can buy! Perhaps some of that lead tainted snake oil you shill! You lead tainted snake oil sales man and performance artist.

2346 2018-02-07 19:24:46 When you done eat your plate of oil down and you just have to relax there for 5 minutes for that goodup food to digest properly 
2347 2018-02-07 19:24:44 It's vegetable oil.
2348 2018-02-07 19:24:41 Better example would have been to see why a pizza costs over $24 and ask your self why something that costs less than $3 costs you $24 . Or a dried pasta dish costs $18 when it’s canned tomato, basil, and olive oil
2349 2018-02-07 19:24:30 Someone posted about an oil company looking to hire does anyone remember who it was
2350 2018-02-07 19:24:28 Lol I don't think Ahneeka likes that oil with onion. Her face says it all loool. I wouldn't like it too hayi #BBNaija
2351 2018-02-07 19:24:26 Excuse me for being cynical, but I wonder if massive multinational oil companies such as @BP_plc are 'acquiring green energy firms' in order to control the pace of replacing of fossil fuels with renewables? #climatechange
2352 2018-02-07 19:24:22 Am making my own yam n red oil this weekend #BBNaija

2356 2018-02-07 19:24:13 Will never buy Cheezits again because they contain #palmoil - which the production of causes #deforestation of vital #rainforest habitats- home to #orangutans (among many wildlife species). It's cheap & unsustainable. Remove palm oil from your products. @RAN
2357 2018-02-07 19:24:11 We don't currently get oil from Venezuela, says PM Holness.
2358 2018-02-07 19:24:00 Why are my oil changes 100 dollars
Should’ve gotten a Toyota like my dad said 
2359 2018-02-07 19:23:57 Like the US $ and oil.
2360 2018-02-07 19:23:45 And so a new chapter begins. KLM to Kuala Lumpur for a return to offshore oil.

If you want to visit a village where oil of argan is produced and being ‘in the rocky desert’ you can go to the Land of Stars (Terre des Etoiles) and stay overnight in a Berber camp! Ciao!
2363 2018-02-07 19:23:31 I love this oil, absolutely gorgeous to use
2364 2018-02-07 19:23:19 Why not pass it and take ALL leverage away from dems on immigration? Its costly but look at advantage.
2365 2018-02-07 19:23:16 I was raised wit respect and know wen to escalate ah situation and know wen to deescalate it ! You bitches wan fight cuz ah bitch said your weave dry!! Like bitch slap some oil on it and stop bein embarrassed by dat try ass shit! And keep it tf moving
2366 2018-02-07 19:23:04 Seriously, add seeds, nuts, legumes to your lettuce. A handful of cherry tomatoes, half an avocado, and a drizzle of olive oil, would be healthy. Having a broccoli salad, a carrot salad, something other than 3 cups of plain lettuce every day would be healthier.
2367 2018-02-07 19:23:02 This is what happens when you have a GOP POTUS & a    GOP run Congress that will subsidize big oil Who don't need it  coal polluting fossil fuel's while subverting & undermining clean long term green energy that in the long run will create more jobs! VOTE
2368 2018-02-07 19:23:00 Looks like Brett Wilson is the new Kevin O'Leary on BNN. Breathless ranting about all the usual oil politics shibboleths. According to him, the Americans are rubber-stamping pipelines hither and yon. Two words: Nebraska, Missouri. #cdnpoli @BNN
2369 2018-02-07 19:22:58 good question about oil imports from venezuela

2372 2018-02-07 19:22:38 Ok, then why would oil companies insist this is a part of the bargain?
2373 2018-02-07 19:22:37 #BBNaija are you telling me this housemates are that broke eating roasted yam and palm oil like village elders
2374 2018-02-07 19:22:28  ALERT: #GasPrices will soon move LOWER countrywide (perhaps temporary). The national average may shed 5-10c/gal over the next week or so. #Oil is now down nearly $5/bbl from its recent peak. Drops at the pump will vary widely, definitely take a few seconds to shop around!
2375 2018-02-07 19:22:15 Ok.. I used tea tree oil for the first time on a pimple last night and it was a MONSTER and it dried it out wow wtf
2376 2018-02-07 19:22:05 A quote from my mechanic today: “usually pretty girls like you don’t keep up with their oil” 
2377 2018-02-07 19:22:03 I absolutely hate getting oil changes ask anybody I leave until the end 
2378 2018-02-07 19:22:00 Lmaoo!!  He need bosley and a hot oil treatment. Dry ass scalp 
2379 2018-02-07 19:21:56 Call for a boycott of BC wine  a shameful move by Alberta's NDP Premier. AS IF this "pressure" will convince #BC not to prioritize environmental concerns over the needs of a foreign owned oil industry & Asian market, to follow #Alberta into abyss of habitat destruction. #cdnpoli
2380 2018-02-07 19:21:49 Wanted to fry up some fish

So I laid the fish in the pan 

Reached over 

And poured dish-soap all over them, instead of olive oil

(Both are kept on the counter)

I'm clearly over-tired

Over-tired with a ruined lunch 
2381 2018-02-07 19:21:48 Communism in real time application is a proven failed concept. That has nothing to do with oil sales and transportation of Alberta publicly owned resources. Your attempted deflection, very lame.
2382 2018-02-07 19:21:30 They think because there was a sale of a oil comp with a 15B market cap it was enough to move the mrkt. I sometimes envy their thinking. Its a little bit like a childs view of the world
2383 2018-02-07 19:21:19 We have our own oil and refineries. So shut it off! It will only help us develop the oil industry in BC more and help get rid of the NDP!
2384 2018-02-07 19:20:42 My mum bought her double insulated oil tank from someone who lived on the levels. Was beautiful house  . They had a stream at the bottom of the garden.  
2385 2018-02-07 19:19:49 Exactly lets be honest here we all know this war is part of an agenda to control gas/oil markets and nothing to do with isis as the public are being told, the days when the MSM can play those games with the minds of the public are well & truly over #socialmediarules 
2386 2018-02-07 19:19:43 Cannabis oil kills cancer <3
2387 2018-02-07 19:19:41 Seems to be a lot of mixed messages  as the pipeline opposers continue to use oil and oil based products to send their message.
2388 2018-02-07 19:19:28 Short #Oil & Short #GBP/USD update.
Even though my full targets are not reached yet, I took partial profits on positions accumulated given the massive moves in very few days helped by the eqty mkt meltdown. Just keeping some structural positions, will reenter later.
2389 2018-02-07 19:19:26 Happy with that.  Many exports on the rise. Oil is a bonus.

2396 2018-02-07 19:18:46 We didn't have loyalty when it came to keeping the internet in Dial up 56k services. So, it hurts me see other countries who are leap frogging us now on renewable energy because we have this loyalty on Oil. Imagine if every new home was required to simply have 5 solar panels.

2399 2018-02-07 19:18:26 Earlier tweet (who?) suggests: Build a refinery, transform diluted bitumen into transportable oil. Then its a different story. From BC perspective, build in #Kamloops, #Merritt - good for jobs, better for environment & gives BC something. #bcpoli #ableg #cdnpoli #CAPP

2414 2018-02-07 19:16:41 You still need pipelines to transport the refined oil.

2427 2018-02-07 19:15:19 Aroma of the Week - Lemon!
-
Lemon oil used in diffusers can create an uplifting, energising effect, giving you a fresh feeling with a slight zing!
-
For some, this goes hand in hand with an uplifting song...
-
For me - The Beach Boys - Good Vibrations.

Give it a go...

2431 2018-02-07 19:14:59 Yes wii! Whole time they playing them song good good and next ting I hearing is Machel talking about ole oil on he face
2432 2018-02-07 19:14:57 I feel your pain. Haven't been in the oil patch for 20 years, but I do safety and risk assessment as part of my work. Focus on K-M is weird given that 50 years of regular tanker traffic have resulted in NO accidents, and only major pipeline rupture was because of city negligence.
2433 2018-02-07 19:14:57 I live in FL. Visited Cuba last month where I learned they import oil because off their shores, it isn't the right grade for gasoline. My question: Is any US offshore oil worth digging for? Perhaps that should be discussed before we plot to desecrate shorelines.
2434 2018-02-07 19:14:57 Palm oil, fresh onion and pepper with bouillon cubes all goes together . Used as a dipping for roasted plantain and yam in some parts of West Africa.
2435 2018-02-07 19:14:51 To secure a job in the oil and gas field
2436 2018-02-07 19:14:47 Nithing small aboot these leeches they can empty oot entire oil reservoirs straight intae their pockets withoot Scotland ever seein' a drop 
2437 2018-02-07 19:14:39 @CitroenUK hi could you tell me when a gearbox oil change is due mileage wise on a Citroen ds3 please
2438 2018-02-07 19:14:32 They only thing that has helped us survive continuous genocide in colonial Canada is the land and all it provides. Food medicine and clean water. Pipelines can stay down in your neck of the woods or keep the oil in the ground
2439 2018-02-07 19:14:26 Just read up on this #BCWine thing. Here's what I've gathered:

1: Alberta won't drink our wine because we won't pipeline their oil.

2. BC wineries might be in trouble.

3. I will have to drink all the wine to save the wineries and the environment.
2440 2018-02-07 19:14:22 Do women really age worse than men ? If it’s true I bet it’s all that coconut oil lol but then again idk shit about skin care. #CocunutOilMakesYouOld
2441 2018-02-07 19:14:18 Tracey, Lance said oil is better transported in pipe than by rail or by truck. Which he is %100 correct. It’s the safest method as far as spills are concerned. 
The Exxon Valdez spill was an OIL TANKER. How many of those travel across land?
2442 2018-02-07 19:14:18 I’ve been saying ima get hair oil and eco styler for a week and still haven’t got it !!

2444 2018-02-07 19:14:01 I thought raw almonds were the most effective way to reverse soy oestrogen? I will have to look into the Ancient Magnesium Oil, thanks.
2445 2018-02-07 19:13:51 This is honestly one of the best oil downs I ever had. It tasting sweet in my mouth
2446 2018-02-07 19:13:48 Poison is ok now, dirty air and water, oil spills, no medical care, eliminating food stamps, you don’t need flu shots, a college education is the overrated, patriots are traitors and traitors are patriots, more guns for everyone....I can go on but the GOP is now a death cult.
2447 2018-02-07 19:13:45 If your pan is well seasoned, sure, but you should dry it thoroughly by putting it back on a burner on low heat for a couple minutes to make sure it is really dry. I normally just wipe it out with a paper towel or scrub with a little oil and kosher salt.
2448 2018-02-07 19:13:41 So “Fake News” is your rebuttal?
“During boom years, the province’s taxpayers shipped more than $20 billion/year on a net basis. when oil prices returned to triple-digit levels after the recession, the cashfrom this province returned. In 2011 reached nearly $19 billion”-Postmedia
2449 2018-02-07 19:13:30 One of the fun parts about wearing wigs is that you could have deep conditioner, coconut oil, and a shower cap on you own hair underneath it and no one would even know... like me today.  #WigLife
2450 2018-02-07 19:13:24 If more people thought the same way the discussions would be much more pleasant and informative. However, as a swivel eyed, snake oil selling, racist, bigot Nazi, I think most discussions soon collapse.
2451 2018-02-07 19:13:19 Will do. Thanks.
2452 2018-02-07 19:13:18 Palm oil sometimes replaces soup..it's not oily when you eat it with something
2453 2018-02-07 19:13:08 Is it that there's no food? Why are the house mates going to eat roasted yam and oil? #bbnaija

2456 2018-02-07 19:13:01 The only people showing their true colouras are you and the @BCLiberals. It is clear that you don;t support our province or the people of BC.

2457 2018-02-07 19:12:53 #oil 15min chart indicating a correction taking place higher, before it continues lower. No momentum, no volatility, careful. #WATCH.
2458 2018-02-07 19:12:52 The Nigerian govt especially under PMB can do a lot. Atleast he promised to control global oil prices and also make $1=#1. So climate change issues are small for this govt.  cc @temitayoojotayo
2459 2018-02-07 19:12:38 Coconut oil worked wonders.
2460 2018-02-07 19:12:37 Well good for the skiing I guess. Not so much for the driving. Thanks for the head up.
2461 2018-02-07 19:12:35 Fracking destroys land around it, killing all the animals that drink from rivers. Paddlefish outsize of Glendive, solme salmon fishing areas. We have drilling close to Fort Peck and they found oil that was leaked close by.
2462 2018-02-07 19:12:29 There has been legal battles for months.  APACHE has 2 companies.  A holdings & investment company &  energy exploration.  When Rothschilds sold 33% of the Holdings company it literally stopped any oil exploration.  Most notably, a $3B oil shelf in Mexico.
2463 2018-02-07 19:12:12 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2464 2018-02-07 19:11:59 Almost exactly 1 year ago the CERI pegged the break even price of tar sands bitumen between $60.52 and $75.73 USD depending on the extraction method. With oil prices today around $61 and Canadian oil selling at a discount the biggest argument for nixing Kinder Morgan is economic.
2465 2018-02-07 19:11:57 snow.  and lots of it.
2466 2018-02-07 19:11:53 Hayibo is that soup or oil what kind of food is this  #BBNaija
2467 2018-02-07 19:11:25 @joshclassenCTV driving to Golden tomorrow. What kind of weather can we expect??
2468 2018-02-07 19:11:23 You add the the numbers the way you want. Part of this for sure is Alberta is tired of bankrolling the equalization payments from money from moving oil. Then being told by sanctimonious folk - don't move the oil through my backyard - but please let my lumber trucks through.
2469 2018-02-07 19:11:21 Toss them in your choice of cooking oil, cayanne pepper, garlic and a dash of salt then bake them on 375 until browned/crispy! Such a yummy snack.
2470 2018-02-07 19:11:18 Wanted to get that dip in oil for something quick
2471 2018-02-07 19:11:11 1) We started exporting our mfg. capacity, raw materials, & scrap to them years ago. We then imported their finished goods, using fossil (bunker oil) fuel burning vessels leaving the "Industrial Waste Overload" behind within their Borders.
2472 2018-02-07 19:11:06 yes! it will help hydrate your dry spots, and balance the oil on your oily spots (without clogging your pores.)
2473 2018-02-07 19:10:58 Can somebody please help me understand why Nigerian meals are always very oil or is that no oil?I JUST WANT TO UNDERSTAND  #BBNaija
2474 2018-02-07 19:10:58 I want to plant a vineyard and oil and bonds for my son
2475 2018-02-07 19:10:54 Swampiest White House ever, brought to you by our ‘Snake Oil Saleman’, aka dotard, without a conscience!!!!
2476 2018-02-07 19:10:51 Yes, absolutely. I'll bring the coconut oil.
2477 2018-02-07 19:10:23 Actually the sewage thing is something I was privy too 
(St John's has a better more responsible sewage plan than a few major cnd cities) 

My retort i'd sooner spill shit than oil.

2481 2018-02-07 19:10:07 I can answer that here.

Carne guisada tacos, spanish rice, refried beans.  Actually I would just be happy with real (not that "ooh it was made with vegetable oil and not lard" crap.  and real fresh corn tortillas.
2482 2018-02-07 19:09:42 Can you die from drinking that vape oil?
2483 2018-02-07 19:09:39 Thats fun one to see better but dosent cover things of importance like cleaning air no polution stop oil spills let people have beach concerns about weather global warming try pull in resouces tell us we have better gas propane whys this hidden carberator jokes parts concern issu
2484 2018-02-07 19:09:39 Just saw a kid I went to high school with was arrested while on LSD completely naked and covered in cooking oil...and suddenly I feel like I may not be doing too bad myself
2485 2018-02-07 19:09:37 Testing 200MA today, but I agree - with the oil price trending downwards
2486 2018-02-07 19:09:32 2/2 Maybe more worrying are large holdings in tobacco, arms and oil & gas companies, at a time when individual universities are divesting.
2487 2018-02-07 19:09:29 Oil and gas stocks getting crushed today. Gap widens further to oil prices.
2488 2018-02-07 19:09:28 Ran out of sage oil this morning so that’s how my day is going x/
2489 2018-02-07 19:09:22 USDCAD trades at day highs. Approaches some tough resistance though.  50% and 100 day MA getting closer
The USDCAD is reaching to new session highs.  The stronger USD and sharply lower oil price may be weighing on the loonie.

2491 2018-02-07 19:09:17 Ronny says  Phew! Your place is fraught with danger. Next door neighbour with a big stick, or the icy depths - stay inside my love & keep mum warm till the oil arrives.

2493 2018-02-07 19:08:56 That's how 'detoothers' talk. They promise the impossibles with very tight deadlines. I hear another one promised oil by 2020.
2494 2018-02-07 19:08:53 It's a local chain which sells, in one shop, everything from motor oil and fishing line to massive airtex granny pants and bras via sweets, haberdashery, yarn, fabric, cutlery, freezer bags, and paint. You'll have to visit one when you're next down!

More water themed sets.. shower.. oil etc. 3. Out side sets or 4. bedroom sets/ living room sets etc .
2507 2018-02-07 19:07:05 It's up to around 2.50 here, I think. I haven't checked it out since oil fell when stock market did, it might be lower than that.
2508 2018-02-07 19:07:03 Senator Mills: I support hydrogen cars... 

Tom Dobbs: That's weird, because you're backed by oil companies. #ManOfTheYear
2509 2018-02-07 19:07:02 IS THIS BENEFICIAL FOR CONSUMERS/TAXPAYERS IN SAME WAY AS THE "RFS" (renewable fuel standard)? "RFS" FORCES OIL INDUSTRY TO PRODUCE MILLIONS OF GALLONS OF GASOLINE MIXED WITH ETHANOL BY LAW. (OTHERWISE CONSUMERS WILL NOT BUY). FARM WELFARE PROGRAM! @realDonaldTrump
2510 2018-02-07 19:06:57 Maybe she can partner with AEI on fixing the problem with Libyan oil money. That way the health insurers can keep profiteering.

2535 2018-02-07 19:05:03 As long as Canada continues to exploit the oil sands, it will never meet its Paris #climatechange agreement targets and will continue to be one of the worst per capita GHG emitters on the planet.
2536 2018-02-07 19:04:52 Look, this is a robust result that isn't going to be overcome. Genetics and environment are both important to intelligence.  Anybody trying to pretend otherwise is selling snake oil to stupid people.

2540 2018-02-07 19:04:32 Oil continues heavy amid the broader USD theme following the announcement of a new US budget deal
Prices tumbled earlier after government data showed a rise in US crude stockpiles, recoveries have remained shallow and hold near/at daily lows.
Next support in Brent crude at $65.00
2541 2018-02-07 19:04:10 IMO, pass budget despite increases. Leverage then returns to R's on immigration. Dems have nothing to hold hostage except Dreamers
2542 2018-02-07 19:03:56 who incorporated that tax in the petrol price build up? they did.when oil prices were falling they included 10%tax  instead of us enjoying a lower price as the world oil price fell they kept increasing the petrol price ,now  who should remove it? who put it in ?

Any more?
2552 2018-02-07 19:02:55 For those that think Exports are going to massively increase let’s look at China

China imports nearly 10% of the World crude production but only buys 3% of the US production. If China liked US oil so much would buying significantly more because it is not as if it is unavailable
2553 2018-02-07 19:02:49 List of things that have 'served us well':

- hand-written legers
- outhouses
- the abacus
- telegraph machines
- asbestos insulation
- oil lamps

Good thing we never tried to improve on those.

2554 2018-02-07 19:02:42 Yeah she dropped her own cash on oil and shit too don’t get me wrong but I got offers for $4000 for that rig and declined every one. Not having it
2555 2018-02-07 19:02:41 @TheOilPalm  why don’t you show how much rainforest you have burned down for this product. This product is not essential to us, and is destroying our rainforests. Rainforests that really ARE NEEDED! BAN palm oil!
2556 2018-02-07 19:02:35 We should drill. We have our own oil. It's safe to drill. We have the technology to do it. We shouldn't be buying oil from countries that don't have our best interest in mind. Energy independence is what we want. And I can't wait to vote Republican in Rhode Island.
2557 2018-02-07 19:02:32 I need someone to change my oil. Would you be so kind? It goes in through here... *spreads legs*
2558 2018-02-07 19:02:29 Butter, always, with asparagus, but broccoli with sesame oil and the merest grind of salt is nutty perfection.
2559 2018-02-07 19:02:23 How many mad liberals do you think have investments in Natural Gas & Oil? If we want clean energy... 40% of the 99% who want Occupy Wall Street, but demand a return on their investment need to make new investments.

2567 2018-02-07 19:01:28 I've been dealing with insomnia on and off for years. And other than Ambien/drugs I've found that about 1.5-2 hours before bed drinking chamomile tea, and rubbing your temples with lavender oil has been the best natural thing for me.
2568 2018-02-07 19:01:22 Is the city easy to navigate and park normally? Is there a lot to do around the stadium? When the final four was here it was awesome. They held different events all over the city which are all walkable from one parking spot. Getting in and out from Lucas oil is easy also.

2572 2018-02-07 19:01:00 RT @LivingSafely: Eating mayonnaise this February? It's made by adding oil to egg yolks. Commercial mayo can be as much as 80% fat!
2573 2018-02-07 19:00:58 Because some rich political donors in some BC ridings do not want to see oil tankers across the bay from their sea side property.

2575 2018-02-07 19:00:43 really? BC boycotted Alberta? Oh no its the other way around. Hey Alberta #BringItOn we fight for the salmon, for the coastline, for the orcas. You enjoy drowning in oil.

2595 2018-02-07 18:59:30 At least we know what to smear over the copious amounts of rubbish left rolling around the streets after the bins are 'emptied'. A bit of palm oil and it'll be gone in no time!
2596 2018-02-07 18:59:29 No way. Protesters ate already hardened against our oil.  I think we should go further.   Block all trailer traffic from the west coast.

2618 2018-02-07 18:56:58 Afraid, no, angry yes. I don’t know anyone wanting to go to Yellowstone/Glacier Park with oil rigs in the view.

2621 2018-02-07 18:56:15 It just got old and stale, then it seems to try to up its game by upping its shock value but it still seems old and stale. Unfortunately they keep drilling even though the oil’s long gone and they’ve hit the sewage line.

2634 2018-02-07 18:55:20 Yep, I'm serious. Oil seeps have been part of nature for millennia and there are bacteria that feed on it. In the event of a spill, any residuals not captured in the direct remediation will biologically breakdown. It will take a  period of time, but it does happen.
2635 2018-02-07 18:55:09 @dougducey We MUST push back against these egregious bills designed to prevent people from speaking out against pipelines Governors are accountable to their constituents, WE Oppose these dangerous new laws, they’ll think twice about caving to oil industry pressure!!!
2636 2018-02-07 18:55:04 That's why we don't want the pipeline expansion , it will bring more tankers to export your oil , we can get oil from Washington state for couple more cents . Don't get it twisted you need us to export your natural resources and without that Alberta economy will be in trouble
2637 2018-02-07 18:54:59 Tillerson breaks down proposed #sanctions on #Venezuela: US has created a work group with Canada and Mexico to study restrictions to Venezuelan oil exports. USGC and Caribbean possibly affected #OOTT
2638 2018-02-07 18:54:59 Thank you @HayekAndKeynes for putting the short crude oil trade on my radar.
2639 2018-02-07 18:54:55 There is another aspect of this.  It's hard to make wine in the middle of an oil spill.  Sure it probably won't be on the same ground, but several in BC they will avoid several if not many oil spills. The lesson is learned.
2640 2018-02-07 18:54:54 People who does make some lash-a-dumplin for Oil Down .. God bless y’all.

2642 2018-02-07 18:54:36 And then there is the electricity saved by not cracking crude oil to make petrol.
2643 2018-02-07 18:54:17 What makes you think Alberta can't do both green and oil? All royalties could be invested in public infrastructure going green, Alberta university research in green in our environment, seed money to create green industry here. Heat, cars, and lights can be achieved in other ways.
2644 2018-02-07 18:54:11 BCs action is deliberately cast to create uncertainty around oil shipments to stop the building of of the TransMountain pipeline.

We should guarantee the shipment oil in the Trans Mountain pipeline to thwart the BC threat.

2646 2018-02-07 18:53:47 People need to understand that this project doesn't put tons of oil in the middle of nowhere. It funnels it through major cities to the coast, which is an essential part of BC's tourism industry. Not to mention increased tanker traffic. 
#BCWine
2647 2018-02-07 18:53:43 Which is good for people working in the oil field, not so much for people that have to pay higher prices at the pump. We don't need to get back the way it was before our mini-bust. Just steady drilling with steady, stable prices.

2667 2018-02-07 18:51:44 Come on, we send the oil farther west so stuff can be made cheap, just so we can buy it back. Makes sense right?
2668 2018-02-07 18:51:33 I'm not saying there's a magic switch to flip here and tomorrow is day zero for oil
But I mean there is something undeniably wrong when a politician is holding a gun to an entirely seperate trade export (wine) because one province wants to review spill plans.

2683 2018-02-07 18:50:31 A single vehicle in the asteroid belt is far like being upset about a single molecule of oil dropped on an entire beach, and it demonstrated the second stage could make it to Mars with a payload. If it wasn't the car, it would have been a concrete block instead.
2684 2018-02-07 18:50:28 I just want oil down today

2686 2018-02-07 18:50:05 Water can mix with many things but not oil due to its compound built-up but it does not stick to any surface.. it rest in the impression or hole or container.. water ever take the color of the object it's in or mixed with. .
2687 2018-02-07 18:49:51 “ Flag up , oil down” 
2688 2018-02-07 18:49:47 Crude oil prices are falling on record U.S. production data and the dollar's continued rebound, which is also weighing on gold.

2690 2018-02-07 18:49:18 What a weasel. He hides and misleads - won't debate in public either. A total huckster and snake oil salesman.
2691 2018-02-07 18:49:17 He put oil on himself that's embarrassing
2692 2018-02-07 18:49:15 Yesterday 'this one' was following you everywhere. Today, 'this one' is pouring oil & blowing kisses. Abeg, who is THIS ONE?
2693 2018-02-07 18:49:12 I do the books during the year and hand it off to a preparer. I take what legally we can take off for a truck.  I live in the middle of the oil patch & when the oil business is good the truck cks are large,when not they are small. It's starting to boom here again.
2694 2018-02-07 18:49:05 Two stage so you dont have to mix gas/oil. 24 inch is plenty, electric start is nice. Dont go cheap with plastic impeller. Ariens and Briggs are great!

2696 2018-02-07 18:48:58 Hi Bill, you've only been following me for a few hours but you're off to bad start. Please don't spam me with your religious and oil pipeline sales pitches. Neither are welcome here. Thanks!

2699 2018-02-07 18:48:54 Such a pain in the ass to change the oil on my Corvette but I really am sick of paying out the ass to oil change shops.
2700 2018-02-07 18:48:52 The price of oil across the world dropped, what would you have the province do for you, big welfare? All of us were impacted by the situation at the time, not just rig-pigs and refinery-rats.
2701 2018-02-07 18:48:46 Where have I been? Virgin olive oil is amaaazing for dry skin I can’t 
2702 2018-02-07 18:48:46 @WBrettWilson let’s hold the carbon tax hostage. No, non, nada, zilch carbon tax plan until the #TransMountain is pumping net new oil shipments. The shirtless moral ruler of “peoplekind” will want to show up for that selfie
2703 2018-02-07 18:48:43 no way i am still praying for oil to get stuck below 65 which could save us !
2704 2018-02-07 18:48:39 That’s the scariest thing to me. How many people who call themselves progressives are lining up to buy snake oil and are not vaccinating their kids. When did they stop believing in science?
2705 2018-02-07 18:48:38 Faithful to oil tycoons and corporations. Soldiers are pawns.
2706 2018-02-07 18:48:37 There is a misnomer right now on the Right. Taking land "away from the fed" doesn't mean it's back in the "public's possession" it means it's on the auction block for mineral and oil extraction. You won't be able to drive your ATV / shoot guns when it's gone. 
2707 2018-02-07 18:48:35 While others have been busy staging protests & sit-ins, we burnt midnight oil to serve the people. Inaugurated projects of worth Rs. 5.5 billion in the health sector in Multan, today’s afternoon.
2708 2018-02-07 18:48:25 I’m in the UK, but it looks like every person put in charge of a US gov dept seems to have personnel gains if the dept fails it’s primary duties. Environmental protection over there is run be ex oil and coal execs. This is totally f’d up.
2709 2018-02-07 18:48:23 Strong environmental controls? Oh really? The oil side loves to say that we are ignorant to the facts and are all hypocrites but science is on our side. Poison is poison. Take a look around. 1 well for every 10 people. Crazy. We are trying to save you from yourselves.
2710 2018-02-07 18:48:14 I'm not sexist. I also heartily dislike the vapid Disney prince of a PM we have. Campaigns on transparency yet embroiled in Cash for Access scandel. "respects" First Nations and quietly gives Enbridge permission to lay oil pipe in sacred land. SJW devoid of meaningful policy.
2711 2018-02-07 18:47:54 OwO what's this oil?
2712 2018-02-07 18:47:37 Joel has been taking the oil for 10 days and says “pain is gone neuropathy is gone and Im sleeping better!”

How awesome is that?!

2717 2018-02-07 18:47:11 What chemicals? Why isn't it just normal oil and potatoes.

2719 2018-02-07 18:46:48 the olive oil i helped make by hand will be coming home in like 3 months finally
2720 2018-02-07 18:46:43 well we've an oil heater in there tbf. Boiler all fixed now as @HomeServeUK came out and replaced a faulty board on the boiler and now all is well in the world!!!
2721 2018-02-07 18:46:18 Don't mean shit with the continued drop in the price of oil. What's your budgetary deficit looking like?
2722 2018-02-07 18:46:07 Also apply a beard balm before you apply oil. They cost 4-5 dollars on avg
2723 2018-02-07 18:46:04 $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
2724 2018-02-07 18:45:58 And your point is ?? Lol it's coming in from every form of transportation, it's always has . Last time I checked you guys have gangs and drugs too . Should we talk about the  pollution oil sands cause ? Or the amount of people who died from heart  disease from beef
2725 2018-02-07 18:45:58 Great idea but we need to kill the oil that feeds the beast if we want change.

2727 2018-02-07 18:45:42 okay cool,  I guess I have to switch brands cause I definitely cowash and deep condition but with Dr Miracle. And I use argon oil & virgin coconut oil as well but my hair still seem as soft since I've bleached it this go around.
2728 2018-02-07 18:45:42 Haha. Its not your bussines, but bussines of Local Sunni Arabs. And they ALLREADY RECLAM the Oil, US is there for them, not for SHIAS AND ASSAD MONKEYS :))) So dont worry, Oil is Arabic there, but NOT assadi Kirkuk is mostly Kurdish City and will be back to them, mostly
2729 2018-02-07 18:45:37 When will you be guaranteeing complete clean up of the disaster created by spilled oil?
2730 2018-02-07 18:45:32 Your policies are hurting small oil and gas companies in our district in favor of big oil and gas. Bad policy for the 15th.
2731 2018-02-07 18:45:23 Yes..I would like to try the Coconut oil.
2732 2018-02-07 18:45:20 The graph is oil demand. Dash for gas primarily impacted electricity generation, replacing coal not oil. 

My hunch is it's probably more related to high petrol tax, declining driving, with a dose of economic downturn in late 2000s.
2733 2018-02-07 18:45:17 BC is gonna cut off your pot supply for cutting of our wine. Explain that to your oil workers!
2734 2018-02-07 18:45:17 In 1977, PEMEX reports that the oil revenues will yield 500,000 million pesos in 6 years, which signal the beginning of an era of prosperity.

2744 2018-02-07 18:44:12 @Nnedi - While I was getting my car’s oil changed, had the opportunity to recommend the Binti trilogy to the mechanic. She even made sure to write down the title, just to be sure!
2745 2018-02-07 18:44:08 Just deep fried my credit card in peanut oil instead of canola oil, hoping it might slim-down the monthly payment.
2746 2018-02-07 18:44:07 THERE IS SUCH THING AS BAD PIZZA. ONCE I HAD SOME PIZZA AND IT HAD A POOL OF OIL IN THE MIDDLE 
2747 2018-02-07 18:44:07 At this time, BC has not attempted to unlawfully restrict or otherwise prevent dilbit or other AB oil from being shipped through BC. Current oil shipments and expansion work continue. 

As Premier Horgan has only *proposed* action, a larger response would be disproportionate.

2750 2018-02-07 18:43:36 For YEARS we allowed to give money away to other countries, ignoring our own - including immigrants already in this country. It is time to focus on our country and spend the money towards it! Increase selling of our oil, positive financial outlook - the worm has turned! Spend!
2751 2018-02-07 18:43:35 Worst part is, any agreements reached can be rolled back or just not implemented as we have seen in past. You buy a used car from Congress?

They already colonizing & stealing all our oil. We need to get rid of African Union bec. it's run by Arabs & White men. The African leaders are just a face doing their bidding.

2763 2018-02-07 18:41:52 But the inevitable oil spill will jeopardize the economic security of hundreds of thousands of working families in B.C.   That's why this isn't fair.
2764 2018-02-07 18:41:41 Planning the purchase of a giant cookie sandwich this Friday between an oil change and my annual (I know...) haircut.

Because rewards.
2765 2018-02-07 18:41:40 Exxon acquired drilling rights to 63 million acres of Russian oil while Tillerson was the CEO.   They want that oil far more than they care about Russia meddling with our Democracy.
2766 2018-02-07 18:41:36 @Suncor and @HuskyEnergyInc are the owners of the tarsands. They are both Canadian corporations. Stop believing oil lies.
2767 2018-02-07 18:41:35 I am using aloe vera gel on my face now & I love it! It is a natural astringent and great moisturizer that also sooths the skin. The one I bought has seaweed extract as a preservative & I figure that is a bonus. I also use an oil blend that includes lotus oil, which I also love
2768 2018-02-07 18:41:32 However there are different varieties - an acre of lavender can yield 250 to 2000 ounces of essential oil... an acre of wheat can yield 40 pounds or $20 worth of flour... do the math, there's almost no reason to synthesize this EO unless putting into air fresheners, etc.
2769 2018-02-07 18:41:24 Glad this day happened in my lifetime. Maybe now we can stop sending American warriors to protect the oil interests in the ME.

Only once in this thread did you, in my mind, respond the way you are supposed to.
And that was my question about the Cannabis oil.
That was a good and honest answer.

2790 2018-02-07 18:39:50 I’ve not checked as staying away from the charts. I’m guessing gold and oil are toast

2793 2018-02-07 18:39:24 Dunn has been a bad Land Commissioner. It was more than symbolic that the first thing he did was put an oil pump on display outside his offices. Now I guess he wants to plant one in front of Congress. Felt he could do that better as Sen. than as Rep. Oil owns enough of Congress.
2794 2018-02-07 18:39:23 Michael J Fox, are you aware that a company is marketing an oil that they claim is derived from cannibis.  They claim that you funded the manufacturing of this product. It claims a graduate student came up with a way to take cannibis and create an oil to alleviate pain.
2795 2018-02-07 18:39:16 Kenya to begin exporting oil in the next 4 yrs. Some good news here. @TullowOilKenya
2796 2018-02-07 18:39:15 That’s what I was thinking.  It was a special night.  I love flower
2797 2018-02-07 18:39:02 They have purchasing power & lavender oil only costs a few pennies per ounce to produce. one acre yields ~1000 ounces of essential oil, by comparison an acre of wheat yields about 40 pounds, or $20 worth of flour... do the math, essential oils are a victim of perceived value.

2804 2018-02-07 18:38:13 I rarely use makeup but for occasions I use the second skin foundation from mikyajy, I mix it with palmer’s face therapy oil. Invest in skin care products first coz usually makeup doesn’t look smooth if your skin is acting up
2805 2018-02-07 18:38:00 I hate orangutans SO MUCH. 

Not really - but I really want Nutella and I know they kill orangutans to source palm oil so it's kind of the same thing.

2818 2018-02-07 18:37:15 Oil industry? #RFID is being used to automatically identify assets out in the field, in lay down yards, on rigs, & wherever there's #oil.
2819 2018-02-07 18:37:10 Mystery is the right word for the revelation, not misery
2820 2018-02-07 18:37:08 yoru gonna tell us your using what stupid oil and gas prices again I don't have a car...I have high rent that has gone up so much...this chart is useless , just looks pretty on inside, waste
2821 2018-02-07 18:37:04 When presale, sir? I need to buy life supply of oil for my car at 20% discount.
2822 2018-02-07 18:36:51 it’s wonderful it comes in little cubes of garlicky brilliance

also you can make your own if you’re feeling fancy with olive oil and minced garlic
2823 2018-02-07 18:36:50 “It’s about fighting climate change”
This is the “Big Fairy Tale”.

Reality;
If the world does not buy Alberta oil it will buy Middle East oil.
If you want to stop climate change stop gas burning automobiles.

Support  economic growth and climate change.

2824 2018-02-07 18:36:48 Gas and oil will be in the hand of Americans (WE THE PEOPLE) soon. 
Saudi Arabia's oil's drying out in a heartbeat.

2825 2018-02-07 18:36:42 EPA staff are also required to notify HQ if a case involve areas of the administration’s personal interest (I.e., oil).
2826 2018-02-07 18:36:35 Hardly, you can’t get your oil to Asia to make said devices.   
2827 2018-02-07 18:36:26 star wars has turned into millennial oil
2828 2018-02-07 18:36:18 Lately there is a new oil spill every week. 
2829 2018-02-07 18:36:12 Microdermabrasion!!!!!! And pixi oil
2830 2018-02-07 18:36:06 Some pizza places had Old oil. Gotta stay healthy when eating pizza too
2831 2018-02-07 18:36:04 Beginning of February and a fat ass daddy long leg just crawled across my chest in my room. Guess it’s time to re-amp those anxiety levels back up to the fullest and break out the peppermint oil.
2832 2018-02-07 18:35:59 We need to see more tanks, missles, hate, marching soldiers just like north Korea, Russia and Red China.
Yet all our secret U.S. companys, and Oil co.'s make trillions from their WARS.
Useing us.
2833 2018-02-07 18:35:47 I mean he is def going to railroad some oil pipelines into native and threatened lands sooo
2834 2018-02-07 18:35:45 @petenajarian Which industry gains the most with the $6 drop in oil? Airlines? $ALK?
2835 2018-02-07 18:35:35 don't get you.what has religion or origin got to do with being a nymph?
2836 2018-02-07 18:35:29 Coconut oil is actually black magic holy fuck
2837 2018-02-07 18:35:28 What AB is trying to do is fire sale exports at the expense of the ROC.  Oil is important but not that important - let's produce enough for ourselves and stop worshipping the export gods. There is no need to increase our exports from their already significant levels.
2838 2018-02-07 18:35:22 Yes there is that as well...a solid way to try and get the opposing goalie off his game, lol
2839 2018-02-07 18:35:21 Not convinced about 2. Lots of money chasing gold, silver, oil recently
2840 2018-02-07 18:35:21 Thank you, thank you thank you.... they're just propping up pricing when something like Lavender yields about 1000 ounces of essential oil per acre, by comparison wheat yields about 40 pounds of flour per acre and only sells for $20, max.  Lavender EO costs pennies per ounce.
2841 2018-02-07 18:35:17 oil price in august 2008 was approx. US$120> (per barrel)
2842 2018-02-07 18:35:15 And increases debt/ deficit, which within 5 min of passing Trump will get hammered for despite Schumer saying on floor he had 0 input.
2843 2018-02-07 18:35:14 Coconut oil of course
2844 2018-02-07 18:35:12 Definitely grilled. With olive oil and sea salt
2845 2018-02-07 18:34:58 Gas prices r wild rn down to put vegetable oil in my car fuck it lol
2846 2018-02-07 18:34:55 Get pure tea tree oil and put it in a water bottle and drink it (1 drop per 4 oz) it helped me get rid of the flu in 2 days
2847 2018-02-07 18:34:47 And we are going for coal anD OIL MAGA
2848 2018-02-07 18:34:39 The US has no other ports selling oil products? My Goodness there really is a shortage out there! What is a port city to do? Golly gee!
2849 2018-02-07 18:34:32 I may just have to buy some oil and cook with the shits
2850 2018-02-07 18:34:30 Let's shut off oil to BC since they don't like pipelines and see how environmentalists manage.
2851 2018-02-07 18:34:14 Out here smelling like wild growth oil 
2852 2018-02-07 18:34:13 I wish pink had a gift basket of the coconut oil collection
2853 2018-02-07 18:34:13 Yesterday was one of the days some oil downs didn't live up to expectations ....
2854 2018-02-07 18:34:13 .@Slomins Why doesn't the account side of the website to access my oil account ever work??? I hate this company!
2855 2018-02-07 18:34:12 
2856 2018-02-07 18:34:12 Profit from What? Where is the oil being sold To?
2857 2018-02-07 18:34:02 Reserve notes halted being able to be redeemed for gold under Roosevelt... silver was similarly utilized until 1964. Correct you are - oil trades in $$. Don’t suspect they will ever go back to pinning it to metal or, any other tangible.
2858 2018-02-07 18:33:53 Coconut oil
2859 2018-02-07 18:33:49 If BC hates oil so much, stop the flow entirely. These people have no clue how much energy impacts their comfortable lives. 

Stop virtue signaling and prove to the rest of the country how little oil you need. Enlighten us.

#KinderMorgan
2860 2018-02-07 18:33:27 Vitamin E oil is great for your skin. It keeps it looking young and plump!
2861 2018-02-07 18:33:24 Final point, central govt wanted to include oil under GST i.e fixing the tax at 18% but state govt did not agree, because it hits their revenue. Even now as per budget central govt has reduced the excise duty but state govt has not reduced. Plus your prices are market driven.
2862 2018-02-07 18:33:08 He was still wiping tears when the game restarted
2863 2018-02-07 18:32:57 Mr Horgan didn't bring a fight. He merely did HIS job by  asking for assurances of the safety of the pipeline and who will be paying for the inevitable oil spill. I didn't vote for him but am proud of his stance.
2864 2018-02-07 18:32:49 We are not responsible for the setting of the 157 conditions it is unethical to expect companies to meet 157 conditions then change your minds is the height of unethical behaviour. Cleaning of our province is the fault of past gov lack of future planning. You consume our oil.
2865 2018-02-07 18:32:46 Nope. Because the long term impact on fisheries and tourism far outstrips any short term revenues that might accrue. 

The truth is that the shale revolution has severely impacted AB competitiveness. Nothing AB can do will change that USA is now an oil exporter. Move on.
2866 2018-02-07 18:32:45 I’m never smokin’ nothin’ ever again(Capone’s, menthol, etc)... Unless it’s THC oil, then I don’t want it.
2867 2018-02-07 18:32:45 Why exactly is she targeting small  businesses to help a big business like oil.
2868 2018-02-07 18:32:22 Well the solution is to add argan oil to the coconut oil
2869 2018-02-07 18:32:19 And FWIW, most seasonings, unless they're in oil or something, don't add calories. Which is bloody handy when I keep finding healthy recipes that are bland as anything!
2870 2018-02-07 18:32:10 Not just the largest in America. Largest growing industry in the world.
China will be miles ahead of the US in a time where the US needs industry to reinvest in. 
Huge mistake to bow to the oil money and back away.
2871 2018-02-07 18:32:08 He actually didn’t say it in regard to Hillary’s email drama - since it wouldn’t be reopened again for at least 20 days — he was saying it about FBI looking into Russian meddling in the election, ya fuckin snake oil salesman.
2872 2018-02-07 18:32:07 I remember as a child, Mum heating up olive oil on a spoon and putting it on cotton wool and then once cooled a little, in it went! 
2873 2018-02-07 18:32:06 No new pipelines. Get used to it. Coal is dead, oil is dying and we need to get ahead of it. We can’t just stand and watch the new economy.
2874 2018-02-07 18:32:02 
2875 2018-02-07 18:31:49 When I bought my car I got 4 free oil changes. This should be my fourth but the service manager told me I had 3 left after today so I’m not going to argue 
2876 2018-02-07 18:31:28 Hearing all the complaints about @cmpco billing so went thru my bills (we auto pay). My November '17 bill was X2 every Nov bill even though we were gone for full week. Its clearly an error (oil heat). Going to scrutinize every bill and join class action lawsuit when time comes.
2877 2018-02-07 18:31:28 mmm... Ik begrijp je punt. Maar Churchill zei dat nog lang vóór het onzalige oil for immigration. Nu ligt dat demografisch even anders...
2878 2018-02-07 18:31:25 Pipeline proponents like to point out the need for oil to keep economy going but fail to discuss the implications of pipeline spills or oil tanker accidents and coastline destruction.  Guess an oiled coast isn’t a concern when you’re 1000+ km inland rolling in $$$ from oil.
2879 2018-02-07 18:31:19 Oil is sexist
Aerospace is not

It's really that simple. As a feminist of the nth degree, Trudeau is woke enough to understand what Canadian plebs cannot.
2880 2018-02-07 18:31:13 The Russian economy is 100% dependent on oil exports. 

Europe is implementing clean energy sources at a rapid pace. They're well along to getting off their oil addiction. 

The US could also move to get off oil, but the political system is owned by the oil industry. 3rd rate.
2881 2018-02-07 18:31:03 And they got to this point how? The oil isn't being shipped via Vancouver yet.

So sad you let every other environmentally damaging thing happen on your watch that there is only 70 left.

Meanwhile everything that got the situation to this point continues... so incredibly sad.
2882 2018-02-07 18:30:44 OIL DIFF: 4.09 -> 4.15
2883 2018-02-07 18:30:41 #Oil is a complicated commodity-you need someone who knows the business to successfully invest in oil.
2884 2018-02-07 18:30:33 See Andrew, even if a "world Class response system" was here in BC so we can see it, and even if all the assurances in the world were made- these oil companies are so greazy, after a spill they dodge and evade responsibility and have their lawyers fight every step in court.
2885 2018-02-07 18:30:20 @realDonaldTrump It will be GREAT for May to correct the Biafra GENOCIDE for British oil. REFERENDUM.

2888 2018-02-07 18:30:02 "Baby oil: Now made from REAL baby!  Our competitors continue to use imitation baby, which we feel results in a subpar product."
2889 2018-02-07 18:29:57 Fermented Cod Liver Oil and Elderberry Syrup taken on a regular basis work wonders. Naturally boost your vitamin D which will help you from getting sick in the first place.
2890 2018-02-07 18:29:53 It seems no other province, and  most first nations people, don't want to bring dirty tar sands oil to port is the impediment. It is time to cut all tax breaks for fossil fuel relics and put them into alternative clean energy. If not now then when?
2891 2018-02-07 18:29:46 "Perhaps surprisingly, the age-related oxidative effect of lifelong fish oil consumption also elevated NASH risk, the scientists noted. Virgin olive oil was the most beneficial in respect of long-term liver health."
Fish oil did enhance the relative length of telomeres.
2892 2018-02-07 18:29:41 @KhayaBusakwe I Dont know if it's early to thank you or what But That "Tissue Oil" treating beard kahle so far..Ta ntwana yam
2893 2018-02-07 18:29:35 This is ridiculous.  I guess the next thing is BC boycotts Alberta beef?  This has nothing to do with "attacking" the AB oil industry, but everything to do with protecting where we live and our ocean resources.
2894 2018-02-07 18:29:27 Exactly, my SAE oil viscosity multi-grade named friend.
2895 2018-02-07 18:29:23 she legit looked at me and said “well you’re kinda fat so a few salads wouldn’t hurt, do you usually eat them” I was so livid I didn’t even answer but I should’ve just told her ofc not a fatty like me only injects oil and burgers in my veins

2897 2018-02-07 18:29:18 Alberta better start building refineries and clean up their own oil before it crosses the rockies.  I'm happy to drink the wine they don't want.. #bcwine #pinotnotpipelines #toastthecoast
2898 2018-02-07 18:29:16 Alberta is doing well. Winery pawns remember oil pawns and pressure BC to smarten up
2899 2018-02-07 18:29:11 looks like oil set the high of this year already ,this panic never gets off when it goes down. #oott
2900 2018-02-07 18:28:53 Moi je ne comprends pas pourquoi tous les indices en usd et eur dégringole ! C’est avec le discours des fomc où le taux de L’oil qui est sortir ?
2901 2018-02-07 18:28:43 A simple one is applying Aloe Vera on the affect area and let it sit for 15 minutes then rinse it off with like warm water.
Or get some aloe vera and mix in oil from 10 vitamin E capsule and oil from 5 vitiamn A capsules and apply it to your skin.
2902 2018-02-07 18:28:26 I stir the sesame oil in at the end
2903 2018-02-07 18:28:20 COCONUT OIL IS AMAZING FOR LASHES!!!!!!!!! try it
2904 2018-02-07 18:28:05 So what did you think? It looks like great waves that would just need a little oil or finishing gel of some kind, right? Or did you hate it? This is my constant struggle. Lol I always feel like it it's crazy all-over-the-place but people tell me they love it? What did you think?
2905 2018-02-07 18:28:02 CRUDE OIL Inventories 1.9M is sending WTI down, the BLACK GOLD has lost 2 DOLLARs per barrel already. GOLD is also losing, 150 PIPS down, now at 1,314 USD.

2907 2018-02-07 18:27:51 quick stir in some sesame oil
2908 2018-02-07 18:27:48 get yourself a auto technician for a bf. mine literally picked up my jeep & took it to his work & did an alignment, balanced my tires, new belt, fuel system cleanse and changed my oil. beyond blessed 
2909 2018-02-07 18:27:41 But have you had pizza that's absolutely drenched in oil, that's disgusting
2910 2018-02-07 18:27:38 It's because humans have mfg.'d Twinkies, phones that Twitter, spaceships, oil rigs and skyscrapers w/ heavy reliance on geology and science, that we shouldn't rely on people from antiquity, who mention nothing of such things, but claim ultimate knowledge of our existence.

2924 2018-02-07 18:26:17 Without the schackles of the customs Union of course shoes clothes will be cheaper we just buy them outside of Europe. As for food well Champagne Olive oil and French cheese may go up, which will annoy the North London Socialists, but won't be other people's priority.Up to the EU
2925 2018-02-07 18:26:17 Rex doesn't WANT to do anything. He's working on big oil/gas deals with Putin, so he not only doesn't want to tick him off, he wants to make sure rigged elections keep those deals going while ignoring sanctions.

Welfare state can't be build on oil revenue. 
It need strong underlying institutions. 
Its not medieval age where autocrat can act on will. 
Where was rule of law? 
His idea of green socialism was disaster.
2930 2018-02-07 18:26:04 Too late. The rest of the world is finding all sorts of oil, natgas and coal to satisfy growing global demand. We are so far behind, it is not possible to recover.
2931 2018-02-07 18:25:57 BC vine us garbage anyways. You dont need vine to survive, once we cut off oil shipments to YVR, you will be thoguht a lesson and quickly.

2935 2018-02-07 18:25:45 if you put the higher absorbtion rate with the way bigger price into perspective, you will see that you pay too much for Krill Oil, the best buck is still with classic Omega 3 products, take price into account they are more effective
2936 2018-02-07 18:25:40 wont the discovery of oil in uganda lead to
1.Economic focus only onto the oil industry?
2.Skilled workers from other sectors shifting to oil industry? @ivanky2 @OilInUg
2937 2018-02-07 18:25:37 how much Alberta oil is heading east through Ontario & Quebec? Just askin'!

2940 2018-02-07 18:25:26 In all fairness, we should be spending about $200 billion yearly on our military similar to other countries.

Other countries are smart enough not to use their armies as muscle for oil companies.

2946 2018-02-07 18:25:01 I brought my car in for an oil change and it’s been over an hour and 30 minutes. I could’ve changed it in 10 minutes. Well at least it’s free. 
2947 2018-02-07 18:24:47 I have had lots of 'first times'. Most of the times, I marvelled at my work but twice, I have come to learn that some DIYs are best left for the professionals. Just wasted a small bottle of olive oil making carrot oil. All the same, I have learnt one way not to make carrot oil.

2953 2018-02-07 18:23:48 Banished from their islands, so the oil guzzling armies could bomb and destroy the middle east. All about the oil endgame. All about greed and hatred. The word evil springs to mind.
2954 2018-02-07 18:23:43 That’s terrible isn’t it. Almost as bad as the Turkish presidents son who was selling and buying Isis oil for years. Bankrolling their genocide......

2960 2018-02-07 18:23:17 If you leave peanut butter out long enough it starts to separate and the peanut oil collects at the top of the jar.  Are you saying you can guarantee that that oil isn’t military grade explosives?

2964 2018-02-07 18:22:35 yeah crazy! wish I sold. I mean in reality if oil goes back to $50 Rig is still at similiar price. MU can't believe it's gone down today. I don't think I have what it takes to hold stocks long term, too much emotion. even airlines I sold out and now going up, then i rebuy high
2965 2018-02-07 18:22:30 I use olive oil & rapeseed oil every day for all kinds of cooking, dressings etc

2967 2018-02-07 18:22:21 The prospect of petrodollars had generated high expectations in the arid Turkana area with a push to maximise the benefits from the discovery of 750 million barrels of oil in the South Lokichar basin.
2968 2018-02-07 18:22:20 Biblically, Spikenard is referenced when Mary of Bethany spent a year’s worth of wages to buy this oil and anoint Jesus’ feet before the Last Supper.   Today, we can buy it on amazon for $19.99.   Wow, how time changes everything.
2969 2018-02-07 18:22:20 Are we in for another massive oil spill thanks to tRump and GOP deregulation? Solar does NOT have spills that ruin the ocean, land or air.
2970 2018-02-07 18:22:18 A battle over how oil revenue will be shared between Turkana County in northern Kenya and the national government is shaping up, after President Uhuru Kenyatta declined to assent to a Bill that spells out a resource-sharing formula.
2971 2018-02-07 18:22:18 This needs more coverage!
2972 2018-02-07 18:22:15 'I am going': That means you're now one of the 84% of the UK who heat their homes with gas . Heat decarbonisation in the UK will prioritise 'off grid' homes which use oil or even coal/wood for heating! UK gas boilers have also become more efficient.

2974 2018-02-07 18:21:56 MOSCOW-Islamic Ambassador to Russia Mehdi Sanai denies Iran concluded oil-for-goods contract with Russia. Says GASPROM hasn't signed deal proposed by Iran,.Criticizes failure of both sides to go beyond mere words about economic cooperation.
(Reason is both sides have no money!)
2975 2018-02-07 18:21:56 In a memorandum explaining the refusal to assent to the Petroleum Exploration and Development and Production Bill 2016, President Kenyatta pushed for reduced shares of oil revenues to the county government and the community.

2984 2018-02-07 18:21:07 Norway also chose to tax highly and borrow heavily in order to avoid dipping in to its oil fund.
2985 2018-02-07 18:21:07 @RachelNotley @albertaNDP why not subsidize the building of refineries here in Alberta and keep the gas no one in Canada wants so our prices are cheaper?  Then we can sell refined products to other provinces at a higher rate than a normal barrel of oil as its refined? #Keystone
2986 2018-02-07 18:21:03 Yes, Trudeau, please stand up and defend the right of B.C. to ensure that oil is transported safely within its provincial borders (she says whilst sipping BC wine..).

2995 2018-02-07 18:19:54 Enno - how sustainable is that if you’ve got wells six years old accelerating production?  Similarly with Bakken shale oil from the summer accelerating in older wells.  Has to come back to earth.

3002 2018-02-07 18:19:33 I’m describing expanding service provision in line with increasing available funds. 1976 IMF Crisis precipitated by high unemployment, high inflation, big balance of payments deficit, stagnant growth & 4-fold rise in oil prices. Not remotely comparable.
3003 2018-02-07 18:19:30 No need to as in one fell swoop he's destroying a progressive future facing industry to protect his friends in the oil/coal sector.  You do know foreign outsourcing of jobs has risen under Trump? I mean look at his reaction to the plunge in the Dow, he has no grasp of economics.
3004 2018-02-07 18:19:26 With lots of cheap oil,  Americans like a low cost to their energy.  Besides it hurts some of their major competitors.

3013 2018-02-07 18:18:42 That is like asking me whether it's right for a doctor to administer a cocktail of medicines to save a key patient, who might die anyway. It's hard to tell whether ThreeWays would pull through or not after the bailout. Nevertheless, it needed a bailout or an oil fund to tap into.

3048 2018-02-07 18:16:19 that is condensate not oil. If they don't have that product over there and can use it as a finished product or to aid in their own refining, this is hardly as monumental as you suggest. Huge US oil production while others cut back will ensure another crash in prices.
3049 2018-02-07 18:16:18 I also put in some shea butter in the winter, just nuke it to get it soft & mix it in the cetaphil cream. You can also use olive oil & vegetable glycerin. I use that all over. I have sensitive skin & low thyroid so I'm thin skinned also.

3064 2018-02-07 18:15:05 So Alberta wants to cease the oil flow that is already occurring via Vancouver port? That’s really going to solve their problem! BC can get what it needs from Washington State -we’ll adapt.
3065 2018-02-07 18:15:05 I hate getting oil changes. Stop trying to sell me a new air filter, I don’t want it. Stop trying to get me to buy the most expensive oil, I’m cheap.

3073 2018-02-07 18:13:34 Oil is not the inevitable way to keep warm, travel, etc.  Alternatives are already happening.  Refusing to accept that oil’s days are numbered is like 19th c blacksmiths saying horses would always be essential means of transport. That didn’t happen, did it?

3086 2018-02-07 18:12:22 Interesting, crude oil and $QQQ are down and underperforming while $SPY is green - mostly due to $XLI and $XLF
3087 2018-02-07 18:12:20 Jubilee reduced share of oil revenue with locals from 10% to 5%. Now that John Munyes has been nominated as petroleum and mining CS, I will wait to see his take with discovery of oil in Turkana.
3088 2018-02-07 18:12:18 watching @bcliberals getting tied in knots by oil patch donors is hilarious. The question @John_Yap is being asked is "Whose side are you on?"; the question he is thinking about is "Dare I cross AB oil patch money?". that is what his consternation is all about @bcpoli

3095 2018-02-07 18:11:03 Try tea tree oil. It really helps
3096 2018-02-07 18:10:50 pay me to empty an oil well to burn all that oil and then pay me more to sequester that co2 in that same well.
3097 2018-02-07 18:10:40 i use the good genes chemical exfoliator by sunday riley but i only got it bc i wanted to get the sleeping oil and they both came in a set. i heard that there r better, cheaper options out there :0
3098 2018-02-07 18:10:37 And we know Posey did it at Mercer,(Joe Batt passed him last night), and Melinda may have at Oil City, or SRSC (I’ll find out) So at least 4 Rhoads over 1000, maybe 5.
3099 2018-02-07 18:10:19 Since Kenya discovered oil in Turkana the political mood has never been cool
3100 2018-02-07 18:10:15 The Green Party also supports less safe methods of oil transportation.
3101 2018-02-07 18:10:13 It would be great if we could eliminate our dependence on middle eastern oil.

3105 2018-02-07 18:09:58 So, BC says when and while the panel is constituted and active, no permits for oil infrastructure will be approved, until the science is settled? Is that what it takes for Mr Carr and Mr Trudeau to actually act. In what time frame, do they act?
3106 2018-02-07 18:09:42 Getting my oil changed for $30 is why i like getting all the stuff from my dad for free. So much better than $100 + normally

3111 2018-02-07 18:09:14 The Green Party supports Canadian continued oil subsidies to the Americans. We must help Americans continue to drive SUVs.

3114 2018-02-07 18:09:01 A spill is a temporary condition that responds favourably to a myriad of remediation techniques, including biological since oil is organic. Pipelines are also equipped with block valves spaced along its length. A break can be isolated up and downstream to limit impact.
3115 2018-02-07 18:08:59 Everyone needs oil. No one NEEDS wine
3116 2018-02-07 18:08:54 No one wants a trade war.
Alberta just wants its right to sell oil.
Time for all Canada  to support fair trade for Alberta.

3117 2018-02-07 18:08:42 The age of oil is over. No propping up of prices will change this.
3118 2018-02-07 18:08:30 I dunno about that. Many Western European countries massively increased their debt in the 70's-80's. Countries which suffered less from the oil shocks, weren't part of the same economic system or saw their debts massively cut at the end of the Cold War don't have the same...
3119 2018-02-07 18:08:19 The Congo basin has enough water for the entire world and 2/3 of Bernin is covered by a forest. Zimbabwe is rich in Uranium and diamonds, Nigeria has oil! Kanti why is Africa poor and an African child destitute
3120 2018-02-07 18:08:03 I'm trying to be on a low carb and low fat diet so I think it would be better for me to use coconut oil from now on. I just didnt realize how much fat exactly was in oil. Like why!
3121 2018-02-07 18:07:57 Today on weird things I text my supervisor “It's not like roasted potatoes where you just toss olive oil on it. It's a totally different makeup. Haha. Like, calm down Rachel Ray. Not everything is solved with EVOO.”

3123 2018-02-07 18:07:44 The 'real' story? The 'true' story? Or just their (fake) 'story'? We like the true kind, ourselves. Maybe that's just us, because we rely on science. By the way, the original Diesel engine was designed to run on bio-diesel (i.e peanut oil), before Diesel died very suspiciously.

3127 2018-02-07 18:06:46 coconut oil is good for everything 
3128 2018-02-07 18:06:46 Nigerians companies dont send the laws in this country, because come to think of it there should be little or no expartriate in the Nigerian oil and gas industry based on this executive bill.
3129 2018-02-07 18:06:41 Fish oil works for me, but there's also Krill oil, which has higher absorption and is a powerful antioxidant as well.
3130 2018-02-07 18:06:33 How are oil patch workers getting hit hard? The pipeline exists and its shipping dilbit.
3131 2018-02-07 18:06:29 OK I have a question.... Is coconut oil alkaline or acidic?  When I went searching to find out.. I found  answers saying both.  It can't be both any more than I can be both a man and a woman  at the same time. So which is right?
3132 2018-02-07 18:06:26 LMFAOOOOOO bitch!! She wants cbd oil she’s like a new person now and is into medical marijuana like she did research as fuck

3145 2018-02-07 18:04:48 I went in for an oil change at 8 am this morning (should have been $15 because I brought in oil/ a filter) It turns out the last time I went they stripped the oil plug so it's going to be at least $60 if it goes right, if not, it's more $ and might take 5 hours. There goes my day

3157 2018-02-07 18:03:13 More to the point, the oil industry got far too used to "just getting its way" in Alberta over decades, and it has no idea how to communicate outside the Calgary Boardroom Bubble.
3158 2018-02-07 18:03:10 Good evenin Mr speaker and honorable house members. It's so disgusting that a country with crude oil is experiencing this kind of fuel scarcity. It's very shameful for government to see fuel hockers as the problem.

3162 2018-02-07 18:02:54 What good is 1.5 billion dollars of paper when the pristine  West coastline of Canada is destroyed by an oil spill ?  Thousands of BC jobs could be lost forever ie. commercial fishing, tourism, aquaculture, what about the wildlife ?  Exxon has never paid a dime for their spill
3163 2018-02-07 18:02:51 If you let people know that you burn used oil, you will not have a problem with supply.

$oil and tech sector( $snap not helping)
3219 2018-02-07 17:57:32 OIL?!?!
3220 2018-02-07 17:57:26 Recien acaba de cerrar el oleoducto Forties (el mas grande del Mar del Norte).. no llega a ese soporte amigo.. Los inventarios vinieron mal y estamos en epoca no estacional pero veo piso en 60.. las petroleras ganan fortunas. Hoy son mas rentables que con el oil a 100.
3221 2018-02-07 17:57:05 1pm appointment cancelled due to storm.  It's nice to know that the oil company cares about their service techs to pull them off the road when the weather is bad
3222 2018-02-07 17:57:03 Coconut oil works WONDERS!
3223 2018-02-07 17:56:47 She wants a trade war and she's also trying to start one with Saskatchewan as well! She's just like Trudeau and hates Alberta! She hates oil and will do and say anything to stop it getting to tidewater! Her and Trudeau should both stand trial for what they're doing to Canada!
3224 2018-02-07 17:56:42 Courage is going back to cook those fries after the oil/lava almost blinded you.
3225 2018-02-07 17:56:41 North Korea demands oil so it can send a ship of delegates to the Olympic games. I say bring them there in tow. THAT'S HOW YOU NEGOTIATE.
3226 2018-02-07 17:56:37 Think about it, Saudi and Co can keep some of these cultures going because of free oil money.

Others who try it without resources tend to be stuck in penury e.g Yemen and Sudan
3227 2018-02-07 17:56:36 Global equities bounce following US market. Dow continues to climb in volatile session, when intra high hits 350 pts. Oil tanks 2 1 mn low, now <$62 as EIA data shows inventory rises contradicting earlier drop est & as Dollar index rose back >$90

3234 2018-02-07 17:56:00 There are many ways beyond Veterans Day, Memorial Day & parades...use the money a parade would cost to shelter & feed homeless vets, encourage AG Sessions to make CBD oil legal & available to vets who are suffering- a few of 100's of meaningful ways to not only honor but help!

3238 2018-02-07 17:55:46 Honestly i think that it can be smoked loll but its mainly for tea ! You can also make it into a body oil or lotion .
3239 2018-02-07 17:55:26 Be on high alert.
There is a new schema coming  & they will be using YouTube as an initiative for marketing.  You will hear things i.e., "The Ultimate Crypto Lifestyle-like Club."  They have a trade signal offering scheme & its website suggests trading "Brend" Crude Oil.  Yep.

3259 2018-02-07 17:53:19 But was it olive oil or coconut oil? Moisturizing in winter is so important.
3260 2018-02-07 17:53:12 Not strictly true (export tariffs have been levied on things like oil), but mostly right.
3261 2018-02-07 17:53:12 Lol im abt to get that oil changed it come with the free wash

3266 2018-02-07 17:52:20 Its about time
Alberta seems to be lagging behind in developing new acceptable standards for many things including spear hunting. If they had it their way they would still be dressed in Flintstone costumes & dragging their wives around by their hair.
The other thing is OIL FFS!
3267 2018-02-07 17:52:18 It shows that they didn’t learn anything from their past mistakes. They so dependant on their oil that they think that it is answer to their problems. Those problems, which were born by their dependency to mentioned oil. #Crypto
3268 2018-02-07 17:52:15 look for a worldwide breakdown in oil
3269 2018-02-07 17:52:14 The left wing in Canada doesn't like the oil industry because it is corporate. If it was more nationalized, like it is every other major oil exporting nation, support for the jobs and wealth it provides would be stronger.

#ableg #oilandgas #cdnpoli
3270 2018-02-07 17:52:10 The debate has shifted from "what's the safest mode of transport" to "should we be shipping oil at all." Except, to make that argument, we'd also need "we're not using airplanes or combusting fossil fuel for vehicles or heat, either."
3271 2018-02-07 17:52:10 Do people actually think you have a clue or real knowledge to share? You are nothing but a snake oil salesperson. When your followers get sick from the flu, that is all on you! You embody EVERYTHING that is wrong with religion. #religulous

3276 2018-02-07 17:51:51 Incorrect. Chevron (now Parkland) refinery in Burnaby appealed to NEB to have access to TMP to no avail. TMP over-subscribed every month by 60% - 70%. Burnaby refinery now relying upon 110 -unit oil tanker trains from North Dakota's Bakken Basin.

3283 2018-02-07 17:50:35 We can use the money he raised (which he stated was for vets) during his campaign. Unless its been spent on large oil portraits.
3284 2018-02-07 17:50:26 @x_JessNOSimpson Oh! Have you taken care of the oil change?
3285 2018-02-07 17:50:15 bitcoin runs on water the oil companies killed me for developing a carburetor that proved it in 1972 but I blockchained my way out of the afterlife to tell you this

3287 2018-02-07 17:50:11 I started using fish oil last week.
Now my fish are completely squeak-free.
3288 2018-02-07 17:50:08 The math is easy. A reduction in oil sands emissions is worth $30 per tonne under the AB or fed system w OBAs, which is actually more than the reward for a reduction in vehicle emissions in Toronto or refining emissions in Quebec.
3289 2018-02-07 17:50:04 lol, oil exploration is shite economics. Do you know what's NOT shite economics? Pensions for millenials that spend most of their time activisting and freely giving info for the common good cough cough eye to you @pb4p @ClareDalyTD get me a good pension lads
3290 2018-02-07 17:49:56 Crazy to think how much we depend on oil and other fossil fuels in our society, and the effort we go to to retrieve it! #OilSands #Lesson5 #FossilFuels

3292 2018-02-07 17:49:53 Too much prep for me nowadays with oil paint, if I make something on the iPad that I like I can wire it to the printers. Shame open shows dont accept digital work though, one day they will.
3293 2018-02-07 17:49:52 Most of the auto shops, heavy diesel and equipment dealers burn oil. They are messy when the oil is crappy. My ex was stuck cleaning the work oil burner a lot. I think for a good reason.
3294 2018-02-07 17:49:50 Los de ahora son un peligro sin duda. Pero puede haber peores. Se puede, como dicen los gringos, saltar del sartén al fuego.
3295 2018-02-07 17:49:46 Homemade Mayo: Combine egg yolk, lemon juice, vinegar, mustard, and 1/2 tsp salt in medium bowl. Whisk until blended and bright yellow, about 30 seconds. Using 1/4 teaspoon measure and whisking constantly, add 1/4 cup oil to yolk mixture, a few drops at a time, about 4 minutes.
3296 2018-02-07 17:49:45 Umm... don't you realize that's because the pooling and sharing aspect of the UK has largely insulated Scotland from the shock of the falling oil revenue? You're actually arguing for the union now, well done!
3297 2018-02-07 17:49:44 I’ve wondered about the location of the oil pumpjack — just outside of Bergstrom AFB? I feel like I read that the jets were an unexpected surprise (?).
3298 2018-02-07 17:49:43 They have a lot of equipment to cover a lot of acres.. feel like their supply would be pretty good. And if people want to dispose of used oil around them too maybe? 
3299 2018-02-07 17:49:42 I cowash & deep condition like every 2 weeks with Garnier Whole Blends coconut water & vanilla extract  (the blue one) & I use Cream of Nature argon oil moisture creme every other day or so bc I’m lazy lol
3300 2018-02-07 17:49:42 It’s an open secret here that some builders take shortcuts to get around those codes, as in the 2015 Tainan quake. Buildings collapsed due to faulty foundation pillars filled with salad oil cans and construction debris.
3301 2018-02-07 17:49:41 @PremierNotley you attack the wine industry to get back at BC oil and gas? You are an idiot who obviously does not play well with others.Hey Alberta maybe it's time to throw this one out of the sandbox.

3303 2018-02-07 17:49:36 @HonAdenDuale is sponsoring a bill that pushes for Counties with oil fields to get 5% of the mineral revenue.Turkana  residents should reject & resist that move.Foreign companies can't come to take away minerals & give the community peanuts,& the national govt gets a larger share
3304 2018-02-07 17:49:34 1. Lucas oil is great for fans. A lot better experience especially when it’s freezing.
2. Turf is definitely a faster surface than grass. Plus the grass dies in the winter. 
3. Yes it gets slippery but grass is proven to cause less fatigue/injuries.
3305 2018-02-07 17:49:30 Just to be clear, Alberta wants new pipelines to support a massive increase in its oil sands production and GHG emissions. This is not "strong climate policy" as some Albertan economists are arguing.

3307 2018-02-07 17:49:15 Child marriage in Northern Nigeria and other such topics. These are good conversations to have, if done civilly. We need to know our values, and the direction we're headed. Surely, there has to be more that unites us than the oil from the South-South.

3330 2018-02-07 17:47:44 The EU now bears no resemblance to the oil and coal union which was the first precursor organisation. So at what point has it stopped reforming? You may not like the kinds of reforms they've implemented, but denying that they have is just wilful blindness.

3357 2018-02-07 17:45:45 Unfortunately it is a trench war against resource development with both NDP provincial governments and the Federal Liberals trying their best to stop oil exploration. Alberta is just more 'diplomatic' in the hope of being reelected.

3364 2018-02-07 17:45:14 Aren't pipelines consistently shown to be the safest method of transporting oil anyway? I can understand local NIMBYism, but it seems purr political pandering st the provincial level
3365 2018-02-07 17:45:14 ah so it's about govt competence not about the importance of the issue itself? Fair point..but given the implications of climate change on oil and that richer countries aren't looking too helpful you don't think it's worth having on the agenda?

3377 2018-02-07 17:43:57 OK, but WHAT are you FOR?  TODAY we need immigration laws promoting economic prosperity for all.  Next, laws for hydrogen energy infrastructure that propels us to fiscal solvency w/out oil.  Think holistically to incentivize public and private sectors. Tax pollution not profit.

Second suggestion: Address the real, true concerns of B.C.-ers: Pipeline & tankers spills. People here are legimitely concerned. Your govt & your industry have not done a good enuf job of making the case that your oil can & will be transported safely.

3438 2018-02-07 17:38:32 Did you know the @StepUpOklahoma plan allows oil companies to pay only 4% for 36 months, close well for 1 year, and reopen the exact same well in a new 4%/36 month incentive period? Effectively never letting a well get to 7%. Love the benevolent oligarchs.

3441 2018-02-07 17:38:18 Fair enough, but do you understand how this undermines the credibility of this policy? Emissions by oil sands producers are among the highest industrial emissions in the country. Couple that with our deference to resource industries and you have the seeds for strong skepticism
3442 2018-02-07 17:37:56 Oil and wine are globally-traded products. If Rachel Notley stopped oil and gasoline shipments to BC, we'd buy what we need from the US. Just like she's drinking California Zinfandel. Easy. Pointless. Silly. @RachelNotley #bcpoli #abpoli #KinderMorgan #stopKM #bcwineboycott

3486 2018-02-07 17:32:59 I have never worked for oil never  will.  I could care less about someone losing their job. Nobody fought for mine when I got layed off because the company made a bad Investments broke the law to get rich . Plenty of  other jobs I don't need a pipeline you don't either.
3487 2018-02-07 17:32:55 Can you please explain exactly what you mean by ‘clean oil and coal’?

3489 2018-02-07 17:32:51 We get most of that from Washington State.   The KM facility ships its oil products to California.
3490 2018-02-07 17:32:47 At the current price level of oil, any thoughts of being oil independent will be gone.
3491 2018-02-07 17:32:43 Pretty much everyone of my calls from last few weeks of analysis is coming through. Oil short is on (earlier than expected granted), eur turning over, dxy gna rip, gold getting drilled, stocks have dipped and ripped, bonds bounced & dropped.cocoa ripped and sugars looking good
3492 2018-02-07 17:32:36 the world will Always need oil..

3495 2018-02-07 17:32:24 Continued reliance on fossil fuels requires much more government intervention than solar or wind would. It requires the government to intervene to maintain the global supply of gas and oil and massive investment in supporting infrastructure.
3496 2018-02-07 17:32:24 My dealership is telling me oil change goes every 6000kms but your manual says 12000km for my 17 Tucson 2L which is right? Sounds off to me @HyundaiCanada
3497 2018-02-07 17:32:14 I have more than pipelines or opening oil reserves.
3498 2018-02-07 17:32:01 Finally got my car an oil change

3500 2018-02-07 17:31:59 @RachelNotley keep up the good fight! SK supports you in this battle with BC. All provinces that have ever received equalization payments should support you. We need to get our oil to international markets! Instead of selling it to the US at a discount to WTI #skpoli #abpoli
3501 2018-02-07 17:31:55 I made my first essential oil charms for my saddle and bridle today and I’m freaking amped about using them when ever the weather behaves enough to ride. 
3502 2018-02-07 17:31:53 Whenever you see Scott Baio on TV you know somebody's car is not getting an oil change.
3503 2018-02-07 17:31:45 Your WCW tweets, “I want a man who fills my tires up and checks my oil” but her bio reads, “feminist brat”
3504 2018-02-07 17:31:40 If people real want to reduce CO2 how about all those gas burning cars.
The Pacific rim countries will import oil from Saudia Arabia if they do not get it from .

3508 2018-02-07 17:30:57 And I can't speak for all those against KM but my understanding it's the fear of oil spills that has them against the pipeline.

3516 2018-02-07 17:30:25 I don't have enough specifics to fix your urgent problem. but I can suggest looking at the data, where the money comes from and goes to, with a clear and unbiased eye. You've decided that the pipeline is a solution, but it's not. Re-examine the problem without bias toward oil.

3521 2018-02-07 17:29:57 How much oil u got till date from saudi ?
3522 2018-02-07 17:29:49 generally no. but oil is trending lower, with $ higher, so it's putting a lid on inflation / overheating fears? $ dropped way too quickly imo
3523 2018-02-07 17:29:45 Within this two days of chaos,I have being able to depict how myopic,sentimental and lack of tolerance inbuilt in our counterparts from the south,this has further shown that there's nothing the northeners can do to please you,you just are hating.

3525 2018-02-07 17:29:43 I find symptom relief from essential oil use. And I think in some cases, of placebo helps it's still a win.

3528 2018-02-07 17:29:14 Oil benefitted people of Norway, allowing a population little larger than Alberta to accumulate an investment fund of more than $1 trillion. (Compare to Alberta's $17 billion heritage fund.) Alberta has been more interested in rewards going to multinational oil companies. #ableg

3535 2018-02-07 17:28:36 I’ll give @EIAgov a pass on the initial miss on shale oil and gas. The issue is whether they are continuing to miss supply predictions in the more recent years where the t chnilogy os better understood and they have better data.
3536 2018-02-07 17:28:28 Nope. Just someone who believes in not destroying our beautiful province and destroying protected sovereign native land that people rely on for food and water in order to line the pockets of Oil companies. Pretty common fucking sense. I like my province. Clearly u don't give af.
3537 2018-02-07 17:28:27 the pokemon teddiursa is a particular essential oil but they were having a deal where if you buy 4 you get one free.

3539 2018-02-07 17:28:23 Baba Buhari you are still my presidential aspirant when come #2019.. But Baba you failed nigerians in the oil sector
3540 2018-02-07 17:28:23 short term competitive prices not a factor in the big picture of oil oligopoly economics- without Tar sands- USA loses leverage against price shocks from cartel action elsewhere. Sadly that does not include environmental costs for any of it.
3541 2018-02-07 17:28:17 SIS you could be getting free oil changes!
3542 2018-02-07 17:28:16 One of my customers burns used oil for heat in their shops.. seems like a good idea. Is this a pretty common set up?

Sounded really efficient for quickly heating/reheating a space, especially with big overhead doors that are open a lot in the winter for equip to move in & out.
3543 2018-02-07 17:28:10 Gotta stay away from sc today. Whole of it is oil down and I CANNOT. 
3544 2018-02-07 17:28:09 What Albertans see too much of is provinces (think Quebec) claim they don't want pipeline for environmental reasons — then buy their oil from Middle East instead. OK with tankers, from non-democratic states with human-rights, ahem, issues.
3545 2018-02-07 17:27:58 Clean the spark plugs! Change the oil! Hit it with a hammer! Give up and accept your newfound need to walk everywhere! Hit it with a hammer again!
3546 2018-02-07 17:27:56 The NEB ruber stamped it, which was a farce to begin with. Now the Feds can say “yes” and bend their knee to oil and gas corporate interests while trying to sweep away real threats and risk to public and environmental security in BC...It’s not worth it. We the people know this.
3547 2018-02-07 17:27:54 Also this study you quoted studied the way the oil behaves once it has been released in the aqueous env. and not the process of pipelines. There are several pipelines going to BC currently, look how many times spill occurred since 50s.

3557 2018-02-07 17:26:32 Too synthetic. Muji oil diffusers are .
3558 2018-02-07 17:26:17 Yes, I love shale, and tar sands - and any onshore structure holding oil or gas reserves - but make no mistake - there are huge pools of oil and gas offshore - and I invest in these whenever there is an opportunity - they are one of our independence resources - an important asset
3559 2018-02-07 17:26:12 Forget a foreign buyers tax, we need an Albertan buyers tax.  Hit them where it hurts - no more investment properties. Imagine if BC real estate/housing wasn't being inflated by wealth generated from oil? #BCPoli #cdnpoli @CoastProtectors @kainagata

3561 2018-02-07 17:26:03 Fact: @SearsAuto is the literal worst.

I took my car in for a basic oil change. 

This turned into $1,200 in damages to the vehicle, including some visible physical damage. 

Sears claims sent out someone to confirm, who flatly denies there is anything wrong.
3562 2018-02-07 17:26:01 Go into Dobbs for a basic service check/oil change. Told it would take an hour. That's kind of long but ok.

1 hour later I ask how much longer. Told my car was just racked so it will be done in about an hour. Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
3563 2018-02-07 17:25:45 Not crude oil, it's cnatural gas condensate, it is very different and far more toxic to water than crude oil. Very difficult to clean up.

3606 2018-02-07 17:21:25 That's correct! More than 130 million gallons of oil was released into the Gulf of Mexico over a period of 87 days, making Deepwater Horizon the largest offshore oil spill in U.S. history.

*also discovered whipping the eggs with extract & oil & then straining them through a chinois before adding gfree flour makes a huge difference*
3624 2018-02-07 17:19:04 I was a dreamer in 1963.  Did the work to become a citizen in 1976.  4 children later and 50 yrs in the oil and gas industry I am retired.
Living the dream today!
Thank God for America.
3625 2018-02-07 17:19:01 supply and demand, the logic behind heroin. Oil in the ground is money in the bank, we will not eliminate it from the energy mix but we can curb the waste. selling it off faster now, or making more $ off it later, this is just beat the street economics at play no longterm vision
3626 2018-02-07 17:18:52 Read my statement again. What do you think is being refined in Canada now due to pipeline blockages. Oil from Mid East. Equalization benefits from Alberta do nothing for BC? The Alberta economy does nothing for BC? Alberta oil leaving the country benefits all Canadians.
3627 2018-02-07 17:18:31 Hi, i presume this works the opposite way round? I'm naturally slim & starting to eat healthier but I don't want to lose weight. Trying different meals (thanks to Dr Xand), going to add more olive oil & avocado, dried fruit snacks etc...can't give up choc though 
3628 2018-02-07 17:18:27 Smoga yg satu bisa membantu membela ribuan lagi yg mati karena masifnya expansi lahan palm oil. Jadi inget kasus Harrison Ford marah2 sama mentri kehutanan di tahun 2013

3633 2018-02-07 17:18:13 But, the last couple of days the facts have come out that Carter Page was being paid BY FBI for 2 years to spy on and hook 2 Russian agents via a bogus oil deal until Mar 2016. Then he joined Trump and in Fall 2016 FBI turned on Page and used him for FISA warrent. 
Govt assholes.

3639 2018-02-07 17:17:46 You should try the really manly one that makes it look like you just changed the oil in your car.
3640 2018-02-07 17:17:38 The MO of the left has been to scam, lie, and deceive women and minorities. Like snake oil hucksters, they've promised much and delivered nothing. The veil is being lifted to expose the hideous hag underneath.

3643 2018-02-07 17:17:31 The actions of our Canadian governments are making our oil and economy worthless.
3644 2018-02-07 17:17:26 Wouldn't wanna end up as oil for the next civilization.

3649 2018-02-07 17:17:15 SSL need all the coal, the oil industry don't like that.
3650 2018-02-07 17:17:14 The cause is open knowledge........ the Navy and Army instead of confisticating petroleum products seized from illegal oil bunkery guys keep blowing them up with explosives or setting them ablaze..... this action is akin to poking we Niger Deltans with sticks in our eyes.
3651 2018-02-07 17:17:12 The legislative fiscal office says the impact of "cleaning the pennies" would be an additional $232m as long as manufacturing, machinery and equipment is taxed (opposed by plants, oil and gas, etc.) Without MM&E, it would produce $117m. #lalege #lagov
3652 2018-02-07 17:17:11 You should sell crude oil for a living...now that’s a roller coaster ride!
3653 2018-02-07 17:17:07 Corn oil? Sunflower? Canola?

3660 2018-02-07 17:15:49 Why is it always something extra when you come get your oil changed?!! I’m broke, leave me alone!! Lmbooo

3662 2018-02-07 17:15:40 My vote is to kill those who did this by slowly lowering them into boiling oil over a period of a couple weeks. Take them out after an hour and let them recover a little, then repeat.
3663 2018-02-07 17:15:33 Brand new tires, oil change, inspection, brakes & rotors, wheel alignment  throw the wholeeeee car away!

3669 2018-02-07 17:14:56 .@SecretaryZinke just put oil & gas lobbyists ahead of American taxpayers by proposing to rollback the BLM’s methane rule, undermining taxpayers, Western communities, and the air we breathe #cutmethane
3670 2018-02-07 17:14:42 It’s not rocket science. When you buy snake oil from a snake oil salesman, you wind up with buyer’s remorse.
3671 2018-02-07 17:14:32 I am certain there is virtually no impact on AB's env from BC's wine, unless we start tracking global events, then AB's oil is much worse position

3676 2018-02-07 17:13:31 When she started she sure wasnt pro! Again, the facts for Alberta are that its oil country...period. People need oil period. Something that few on the left will admit. Notely is in a struggle for her political life, she has to do this if she wants to keep more than 1 seat!

3685 2018-02-07 17:12:33 Or more generally, the moment oil billionaires captured the GOP, but that seems to have been a  decades-long plan!
3686 2018-02-07 17:12:30 Just another stupid pissing match. Grow up, try using facts to support the pipeline rather than “the NEB said it’s okay.” When was the last oil spill? What measures are in place in case that happens? You won’t get 100% support but maybe there would be less PUBLIC pushback.
3687 2018-02-07 17:12:28 Majority of events are held in superb locations! I went to an oil and gas exhibition in Italy once...
3688 2018-02-07 17:12:25 At Coastal Commission meeting in Cambria, where commissioners will consider sending a letter to BOEM opposing the Trump administration's offshore oil plan, as well as the Oceano Dunes dust mitigation plan.
3689 2018-02-07 17:12:14 “Cooking oil.” Extra virgin?
3690 2018-02-07 17:12:13 Dirty oil
3691 2018-02-07 17:12:12 Lol...yeah,I am sure Putin loved being referred to as a "regional power".I am sure he had no problems at losing out in the billions in the Exxon/Russian Oil deal due to sanctions.Any proof I give you you will just say fake or mainstream bias...Putin is a man's man right?They love
3692 2018-02-07 17:12:06 Another reason for us @arsenal fans to abhor @SpursOfficial ... Kane credits his career to not only getting rejected by Arsenal's academy but inspiration from Tom Brady's career... yeah, keep on idolizing that smarmy, snake oil selling, cheater, Kane.
3693 2018-02-07 17:12:00 So no one in BC requires or uses petroleum products? You would instead use unethical oil products from Middle Eastern Countries than have your own country thrive? Makes sense to me...
3694 2018-02-07 17:11:42 Not enough reason to ban oil and gas, I guess.  
3695 2018-02-07 17:11:38 I haven’t smoked in a while need th oil for my pen 
3696 2018-02-07 17:11:15 We also need TRUTH commercials about the pollution and health problems caused by BIG OIL, effects breathing, water, land!
3697 2018-02-07 17:11:13 I think the better option would be to cut off all nat gas and oil into BC.  They will change their tune quickly!
3698 2018-02-07 17:11:12 Your "Mental Health" comes first "Oil Tot"! 
3699 2018-02-07 17:11:02 Do you live where cannabis is legal or available with a card? I have several friends with severe insomnia who now all swear by CBD oil. Saw one of them yesterday & she was so rested & buoyant. Such a visible difference in her!
3700 2018-02-07 17:10:55 Because Trump is and always has been  all about the show, but absolutely zero substance. Unfortunately, too many fall for the show. He is purely a snake oil salesman.
3701 2018-02-07 17:10:51 My condolences to all those not having oil down.
3702 2018-02-07 17:10:51 Have I told you lately how pathetic and desperate you are?  You might still be able to sell your snake oil to your base but  the remaining 70% of the Country knows you’re a “Con” as you’ve been all your life! Tick tock, tick tock!
3703 2018-02-07 17:10:41 I assume he and a team of porters will set off in canoe to eastern Canada to sell that wine... cause you know... shipping by truck (that burns Alberta oil), would be a tad hypotrictal!

3709 2018-02-07 17:10:03 Israeli Energy Minister: Israel hopes to solve a dispute over offshore oil & gas reserves with Lebanon through international mediation. However, there is no doubt Israel is strongest state in the region & we will protect our economic waters, our natural gas platforms &reservoirs.
3710 2018-02-07 17:10:03 This is beyond disgusting. Why is oil and gas propaganda in my timeline?
3711 2018-02-07 17:09:59 The oil industry is dead its time for Alberta to get with the times. Time to move into the future!  Green energy #CleanEnergyJobs
3712 2018-02-07 17:09:56 Yes one is power production and the other is power services just as u have two oil and gas as well with one oil and gas production and the other oil and gas services

3717 2018-02-07 17:09:06 Happy independence to all. How do we determine the overall winner of the oil down.?
3718 2018-02-07 17:08:52 The equilibrium oil price is clearly $50 and has already been so for some time. Tech advances can only reduce this number. The only factor that could increase it is widespread carbon taxation.
3719 2018-02-07 17:08:45 It’s sketchy in the fact it’s working pressure is way high vs butane so only certain cls setups can safely handle it,  but as far as the oil goes propane can make just fine products.   Sorry lol carry on.

3722 2018-02-07 17:08:33 Gregor: Another factor driving oil and gas is thank to or neighbours to the south. The US economy is moving because the group is not playing in the climate change space, and uncertainty around NAFTA.

3727 2018-02-07 17:07:37 Or E: Rachel Notley could say, "Since Alberta stands to gain $Billions, what can we do to ensure BC is prepared for a catastrophic bitumen oil spill?"

Instead, Notley would rather whine about how she's not able to wallow in oil money yet.
3728 2018-02-07 17:07:30 I’ll admit that a large amount of my opinion on DNC consultants being snake oil salesmen comes from my experience working in the neoliberal hellscape of San Francisco web/tech. You get to see horrible robber barons want a gold medal for mentioning “diversity” in a memo once

3732 2018-02-07 17:06:57 Ask @OfficeOfRG @inc ur masters, Mr Satish Sharma, Minister of Petroleum & Natural Gas, who sold out ONGC oil fields to US, claiming that we running in lost & later same companies started making money ! Essar, Reliance, BG. All during congress era !
3733 2018-02-07 17:06:57 Every time I make oil the recipe literally calls for like half an O and I’m over here with 2 1/2 O’s  making it IMPOSSIBLE for me to dose them properly... guess I’ll be fucked up 
3734 2018-02-07 17:06:43 I'm massively excited, actually. My first thought was Oo! My second thought was Bugger! They almost definitely will contain something I'm allergic to, like limonene in essential oils. Pants. Put me out of my misery - do they contain essential oil?

3738 2018-02-07 17:06:33 canada: we ban the fishing and wholesale of certain fish once their population dips because we care about the environment!
also canada: actively develops the little green areas towns have left, drill for oil to oblivion
3739 2018-02-07 17:06:31 Not eco friendly though. Since a certain % of ships run on the cheapest leftovers of all oil. How do we meet Paris targets.
3740 2018-02-07 17:06:16 vitamin e oil really helps grow your lashes!!
3741 2018-02-07 17:06:04 Gregor: Misconception that oil & gas is the growth engine in Alberta's recent past - but this is untrue, it's oil sands development that's been the heavy-hitter in expanding the current economy.
3742 2018-02-07 17:06:03 It's not a crime to work for an oil company, and be an adviser.   
You idiots have all become Joe McCarthy.
3743 2018-02-07 17:05:28 Because of crazy cost of oil and gas.
3744 2018-02-07 17:05:28 You need to stop doing any sort of job you enjoy and take up working on an oil rig for the greater good of feminism. If you don't then you have internalized misogyny and don't know what's best for you.
3745 2018-02-07 17:05:22 Yikes I need an oil change

3749 2018-02-07 17:04:59 Canadian oil production is probably the most emissions considerate in the world. We can all go back to horses, then we would just have to worry about cleaning all the manure up from the streets . Or we can keep buying it from the Middle East. Not so much into clean air there.
3750 2018-02-07 17:04:46 I'm not sick of snow because of the snow itself, I'm sick of it because every time one of these systems moves through it brings a migraine with it.

Let's hope Advil, a nap and a peppermint oil temple massage will kick this before it comes. Ain't nobody got time for this.

3753 2018-02-07 17:04:34 "we drink water not oil" Please feed the snowflake some seawater. Because that is where the drilling is.
3754 2018-02-07 17:04:30 I thought my oil change was today...thank God it isn't.
3755 2018-02-07 17:04:28 If you hate big oil then I wouldn’t be so condescending towards Elon’s “car commercial” as you called it. You know the very car that is ushering in a non-oil world?
3756 2018-02-07 17:04:26 
3757 2018-02-07 17:04:25 I've used cbd oil it went pretty quick though! I want to buy more one day but i cant afford it, had my JSA cut so no personal income  ill use this when i can next buy some 
3758 2018-02-07 17:04:18 I mean its not like this same administration is downplaying the age & danger of pushing oil through a 60 yr old line in a lake that was certified "safe" by the oil company responsible for several huge leaks in the state and elsewhere.... oh wait.
3759 2018-02-07 17:04:08 Please add to your activism against Oil drilling that its unnessary. There is unlimited Hydrogen in the Atlantic next to Brazil. They also don't have cut down forests to grow sugar cane for biofuels, but stll be energy independent with solar/wind/hydrogen.
3760 2018-02-07 17:04:06 Embarrassing and sad to watch paid protesters spearhead an obstructionist agenda and watch a once vibrant oil industry held hostage by spineless politicians.

3762 2018-02-07 17:03:41 I think the batter ones I eat are Thai sweets cx sometimes they add sesame too. That makes sense, I wouldn't imagine putting too much oil in plantain without coating.
3763 2018-02-07 17:03:26 Still shocked that Ghana is actively mining oil and gold. That's like a Nigeria - SA hybrid.
3764 2018-02-07 17:03:23 Yes! I love using coconut oil, particularly in making bathbombs.
3765 2018-02-07 17:03:21 True, as its plastic. I just was referring to politically toxic to include it in a clean power plan in Texas. There will be a long non burning need for oil products until we can mass produce synthetic oils that perform as well as natural oil
3766 2018-02-07 17:03:12 Gregor: oil & gas is resizing and reshaping, and in the mean time, new markets are being created as Albertan industry changes dramatically. Small, mid and large energy companies are facing different problems.
3767 2018-02-07 17:03:09 15:00. Quem vendeu índice acima de 84.000 fez bom negócio. Mercado bem frágil. DXY e 10 yr bem sólidos. Oil azedando para quem estava bullishi 1 semana atrás.
3768 2018-02-07 17:03:06 The more tightly your clothing fits against your body, the more it will trap dirt, oil &amp; sweat on your skin, which could cause body acne.
3769 2018-02-07 17:03:03 These are the days
Some paid with their lives
We some how someway survived
So are u surprised
That love can conquer
So forth with conquer hatred is spilled
So in this moment of tranquility
We should all b thrilled
Some spilled with oil
We must seek a new way to graduate from oil
3770 2018-02-07 17:02:55 I started paying close attention to Venezuela thinking that the 2015 market decline would precipitate a fat tail oil market event but now I find myself riveted by the human cost associated with Chavismo/ Maduro.
3771 2018-02-07 17:02:55 And the steel-making process still gives off emissions, correct? Point being made, whether it's for steel or energy, coal is a dirty resource. Oil is a dirty resource for fuel and plastics.
3772 2018-02-07 17:02:52 It's the oil company Puma,not the clothing brand.
3773 2018-02-07 17:02:50 It was great, we learned that we need to take our “crushed” life and enlighten the world like the Jews with the olive oil in the mishkan @yeshblum @ChabadEastVan

3776 2018-02-07 17:02:39 So I grilled two Beyond Burgers in a coconut oil greased skillet. Seasoned them with mesquite seasonings. DAMN NEAR AT MY FINGERS OFF. The heft, greasiness and fat flavors are unlike any other non-meat burger I’ve had. #kudos
3777 2018-02-07 17:02:28 Are you an oil driller? Frack miner? What has he done? Cut income in taxes and spend billions on a wall. Make less, spend more. Not how I run my business!
3778 2018-02-07 17:02:18 I'd like to know where aaalll the coal jobs are and how to apply. Mr tramp said coal jobs were coming back and Iiiiii want one   Or can You direct me to the CLean oil department. I'd like to flourish,also, with all these opportunities.

3780 2018-02-07 17:02:02 Have you heard of Pre-pooing? It’s applying oil to your hair before shampooing & conditioning in order to help with moisture and detangling #fact #hair
3781 2018-02-07 17:02:02 Never had them fried in batter before. For plantains, I use oil to fry it, but not too much, to cook it to a perfect golden brown.

3784 2018-02-07 17:01:47 @TransCanada My recommendation to break the impasse over trucking firms and oil transport is to build pipelines that transport grain via vacuum systems (much as Elon Musk is designing magnetic / vacuum passenger rail train pipeline systems) to move grain from storage to port. ??
3785 2018-02-07 17:01:43 More slick talk and lies from that treasonous snake oil salesman!
3786 2018-02-07 17:01:40 Have any of my followers used any Pixi skin care products? I'm interested to try the rose blend or jasmine blend oil but want to know if they're worth it
3787 2018-02-07 17:01:38 Mostly mains gas, heating water pumped round the house through radiators. In rural areas. sometimes burning oil from a tank instead, but twice the cost. Some electric too either directly in each room or pumping hot water around, even more expensive. Forced air is uncommon.
3788 2018-02-07 17:01:33 a suck up to big oil?  Really?  Tell that to all the oil workers from BC.  I guess we should go out and support Small Oil then.
3789 2018-02-07 17:01:33 I needed the laptop tho, lol I wasted coconut oil on my other one. 
3790 2018-02-07 17:01:27 Considered getting the new nars foundation but @MakeupShayla review always helps me with my decisions so it’s a no I don’t need oil spills lol
3791 2018-02-07 17:01:23 You probably remember your oil changes, but don't forget about your filters! Dirty filters can increase your fuel usage by as much as 10%.
3792 2018-02-07 17:01:23 Gregor: Alberta has "flattened out" - the decrease we may have seen in the past few years is going to slow and eventually start turning around, even if oil isn't driving the growth.

3797 2018-02-07 17:00:53 Here's a tip: Check your oil level every other time you fill up. The engine will be warm, and you'll remember to give it regular attention!
3798 2018-02-07 17:00:51 Me: makes oil and sugar free chocolate muffins to satisfy my cravings in a *healthy* way

3805 2018-02-07 17:00:30 @Ford I have a 2017 Ford Escape, and we can't keep mice out from under the hood! It is regularly maintained, clean, no food & I drive it pretty regularly. The last oil change resulted in a $300 bill from Ford for the nest. And again...we are noticing droppings. What can be done?

3809 2018-02-07 16:59:55 .    Just like Saudi Arabia. Give away oil money.  If Calif establishes a basic salary, it will allow citizens more time to conjure up illegal things.   #anarchystate   BTW: With all the give-away programs,  what’s the difference.  Maybe they will include illegals. 
3810 2018-02-07 16:59:54 Gas prices could dip towards $2.00 a gallon again...lower #oil prices
3811 2018-02-07 16:59:47 the proof that watching US OIL STOCKS for trading purposes is wrong came with news that US sells oil to the Middle East.
3812 2018-02-07 16:59:39 Oil down.. rates back up, dollar up. Market up. It’s all gravy.

3816 2018-02-07 16:59:17 We have a restaurant that serves reallllly good crispy fries with garlic “sauce” (I think it’s more of an oil but whatever) delicious but not gluten free so I can’t have them any more XD
3817 2018-02-07 16:59:10 Been drinking @BeavertownBeer Neck Oil in my local for 2months straight at least 5 times a week now. Always fresh (as the pub goes through 10 kegs a week) and remarkably consistent.
3818 2018-02-07 16:59:02 Apparently it was always their game Smoke & Mirrors make you believe one thing but in reality hide what they doNt want people to see like using Canola oil on prepared food is just one example

3820 2018-02-07 16:58:44 Omg my dumbass almost put sesame oil in my waffle mix 
3821 2018-02-07 16:58:34 Looks like government opposing our Keep It In The Ground Bill on the basis on "energy security". It's a complete red herring, because no matter how much oil or gas found, it's given away to fossil fuel companies and sold back at market prices.
3822 2018-02-07 16:58:32 That's so lovely to hear Tracey, thank you, we're so glad you're enjoying using our oil! We completely agree :)
3823 2018-02-07 16:58:25 They used to give us detachol to remove the pieces and that made my skin even worse after wearing it for almost 30 days straight and running miles a night. Switched to coconut oil and it got better. Thanks! That make was done by @GamingShogun
3824 2018-02-07 16:58:19 True! But as we both know some dealers can’t be trusted. Worst experiences I had with tyres, pads etc was with Porsche in Brum. New Boxster S supposedly requiring new tyres and pads after 12,000!!! Oil was twice the price of Halfords & tyres £100 each more than Kwik Fit. 
3825 2018-02-07 16:58:11 Bought some cypress essential oil yesterday, I smell like a tree. I love it.  
3826 2018-02-07 16:58:03 I think an oil guy running foreign policy is way more consistent than a coal guy at the EPA
3827 2018-02-07 16:57:53 I know you have probably tried everything but I have heard a bunch about charletts web oil for chronic pain. There's also a lot of YouTube videos about it. Maybe something to check in to.
3828 2018-02-07 16:57:46 Getting my uncle Hughie to change my oil is a lot cheaper lol , only cost me a pint of vodka
3829 2018-02-07 16:57:43 Tea tree oil 2x a day will kill it.

3831 2018-02-07 16:57:33 He is also invested in oil and gas and wants to see environmental regs slashed, as well as workers rights and any other regulation that gets in the way of profit. This man cares for no one, just money and power - watch him closely!
3832 2018-02-07 16:57:26 Clinique Take the Day Off Cleansing Balm or Hada Labo Cleansing Oil
3833 2018-02-07 16:57:01 However the same can be true for too much clean energy.  Point in fact is Germany who decided the answer was corn oil for fuel!  NIf you check it out you’ll see that $ created a frenzy and now animal are in danger as most crop fields have turned to corn - no turn over soil loss
3834 2018-02-07 16:56:50 Yall almost didn't have oil down today. Thank God we found 2 breadfruit on the tree 
3835 2018-02-07 16:56:48 Heard someone make the argument that Butter was a contributing cause of the Reformation. 

Butter was fasted from in the Roman Church but not Olive Oil. Fasting overly penalised Northern European poor as a result making the Reformation popular amongst Northern European nations.
3836 2018-02-07 16:56:39 A 1hr wait at walmart to get my oil changed.... life as an adult
3837 2018-02-07 16:56:32 Castor oil overnight worked really well for me :)
3838 2018-02-07 16:56:31 #sjuxhs @mrslouisa7100 About offshore drilling, I feel that we have no reason to take oil that we don't need.
3839 2018-02-07 16:56:29 @jjhorgan How can @RachelNotley compare exports benefiting Big Oil to small town wineries...many that are owned/heavily invested in by Albertans? #shortsighted
3840 2018-02-07 16:56:27 my tired ass put sesame oil instead of balsamic vinegar in my salad at 4am so here’s to having the worst salad of my life
3841 2018-02-07 16:55:46 Another one on the bucket list, which is now an oil drum because of @colcollective simply stunning.........Again!
3842 2018-02-07 16:55:43 All I want is a fresh salad with well done grilled chicken, hass avocado, pineapples,oil and red wine vinegar. 
3843 2018-02-07 16:55:40 There was once a site called shares almanac, where investors could submit notable events such as drilling, then people could see a time line of upcoming activity.
3844 2018-02-07 16:55:35 While JT is making dumb jokes, Canadian oil drilling rigs are leaving Alberta for the US because of a more attractive tax and regulatory environment down there. JT is destroying the business climate in Canada preferring to play at « Mr Superwoman ».  Pathetic.
3845 2018-02-07 16:55:24 “too much oil money never enough booze" from Corb Lund comes to mind, but too long for a hashtag
3846 2018-02-07 16:55:02 I just wanna give a shout out to Extra virgin olive oil for making my hair soft & bouncy 
3847 2018-02-07 16:55:01 Russia and China vie to beat the US in the trillion-dollar race to control the Arctic: Russia has long sought economic + military dominance in part of the world where as much as $35 tn worth of untapped oil + nat gas could be lurking. Now China is pushing its way into the Arctic
3848 2018-02-07 16:54:53 Technology seems to always trump perceived shortages. We’ve been running out of food, natural gas, and oil for the past 50 years. Today we have abundance of all three due to technology.
3849 2018-02-07 16:54:53 Wash frequently, Lock in moisture (coconut oil), Home made hair masks work really well too.

PS: Trim split ends
3850 2018-02-07 16:54:48 I need oil down not no brown down 
3851 2018-02-07 16:54:00 still find it amazing that he hiked rates in midst of European debt crisis b/c oil rallied
3852 2018-02-07 16:53:59 I left my blistex and Vaseline home so I've been using olive oil on my lips all day
3853 2018-02-07 16:53:55 Hi I am watching your show now you had mentioned about butter and was determined that number 2 was made with olive oil which you is good but then you said number 5 was the real butter but is there a name for the real butter.
3854 2018-02-07 16:53:54 
3855 2018-02-07 16:53:47 Electric start is very helpful. Also not having to mix the gas/oil manually is helpful if you’re not machinery inclined. I have a craftsman 24” two stage thrower and it handles WI snow great.
3856 2018-02-07 16:53:47 Smell  like motor oil and confidence
3857 2018-02-07 16:53:38 usa anti-venezuela sentiment fucking blows my mind; our secretary of state is literally the ex-ceo of a massive oil company, and vz has some of the world's largest oil fields. the conflicts of interest (or maybe harmony of interests, for tillerson??) are baffling
3858 2018-02-07 16:53:28 #oil signals momentum lower off EIA inventory data relase is over. Consolidation here and then daily chart still has volatility clicking in, it's waxing right now, more movement lower later. #WATCH
3859 2018-02-07 16:53:16 Argan oil conditioner. I add other natural products to it. But the base conditioner was one n only Argan oil think that makes the difference
3860 2018-02-07 16:53:13 Pull profits now and dump into oil and gas
3861 2018-02-07 16:53:12 i should have gone in higher with a wider stop but the volatility had me worried, im up 21 ticks on the day, was 38 but lost a load on that movement

3864 2018-02-07 16:52:43 Pros aide was rough on me and dried out my skin like butts until I started using the myristate to remove, it's like concentrated oil that hydrates super well! I like your makeup! Super cool shading on that!

BJP in power- Diecel price too will be decided by oil companies.
3869 2018-02-07 16:52:28 not for nothing but the past 48hrs CBD oil has been repeatedly thrown in my face -- lubes, drops, edibles and now bath bombs. HEARD YOU GOD 
3870 2018-02-07 16:52:25 @CashErrthing @oilfractals  I think we bounce here at 61.80, next leg down will be 60, could be tomorrow
3871 2018-02-07 16:52:23 Lovely things if done right. Roast them with oil and bacon, and maybe chestnuts. Never boil them.
3872 2018-02-07 16:52:21 Why does one single drop of hot oil burn like 23 drops??
3873 2018-02-07 16:52:19 Whenever you get that oil change 
3874 2018-02-07 16:52:08 what ever  you should resign!   you had billions of dollars to develop new markets?industries  and you gave it to big oil AGAIN  you started this war to cover your own short falls.  BC whole history  protects its land and coast why would this time be different  @JustinTrudeau
3875 2018-02-07 16:52:05 hate getting oil changes 
3876 2018-02-07 16:52:04 lol with a car and no oil.
3877 2018-02-07 16:51:54 It's gonna create jobs or whatever so they're all about it. Alberta will always be an oil town
3878 2018-02-07 16:51:36 The article tries to put together two things that are totally unrelated. First off the car was only ballast and it was a test launch. Why pick on Elon Musk, what about Apple, Google, Microsoft, Oil Companies, other billionaires/millionaires. Crap journalism!
3879 2018-02-07 16:51:31 The year is 2039. Dangote refineries is now fully functional, acquires Oando PLC. Becomes the biggest player in the Nigerian oil industry.
3880 2018-02-07 16:51:28 The quantity of the discovered oil was exaggerated, very little was found at the time of mining
3881 2018-02-07 16:51:19 Tillerson is an " OilMan " Exxon billionaire have no idea what the hell he's doing as SecOfState ! It was Russia ideas he get position to remove sanctions from Russia an their oil buisnes Rosneft . Obama Administra sanctions .. Rex reasonable guy but get pushed around
3882 2018-02-07 16:51:01 Maybe but something like a final push must be done something crucial and definitive to annul the government which is killing more and causing more harm than what any short term us oil sanctions could cause. China and India are not close to buying same amount of oil of that of USA
3883 2018-02-07 16:50:58 It's fascinating. Tesla is widely credited for leading the electric revolution in automobile. The car companies along with huge pressure by the oil companies had been suppressing its development for decades.
3884 2018-02-07 16:50:58 i was too slow clicking lol
3885 2018-02-07 16:50:38 we  do not need wine to live BC NEEDS ENERGY CUT IT OFF asap let them live without oil and gas for awhile. You all claim you dont need alta well prove it you all drive cars and use energy, in reality you are mostly full of the shit you dump in the ocean you claim to love so much
3886 2018-02-07 16:50:24 I've been taking oregano oil drops daily for the last 3 years (& MORE if you count pre-pregnancy) & yet I am still not used to the nasty ass aftertaste. So good, but so gross tasting.
3887 2018-02-07 16:50:19 It isn't, but whatever makes you feel better about the fact that people are slowly but surely, and picking up speed, getting wise to the con game of snake oil Jesus; I'm hardly alone these days. You still don't know jack shit about me or how I came to my conclusions, so fuck you.
3888 2018-02-07 16:50:19 its oil.
3889 2018-02-07 16:50:13 Perhaps an independent Scotland could even save the rUK from Brexit. Afterall, once WM no longer had Scottish exports (especially NS oil) they'd have zero negotiating power for trade. #SaveTheUKVoteIndyScot
3890 2018-02-07 16:50:05 have you tried lying on a hard floor?
3891 2018-02-07 16:49:49 @TradersCom #Oil goes up and the P&E stks go dn cuz ppl say "it will cause more drilling". OK #oil goes dn and still stks go dn cuz ppl say "see more drilling"

I was half surprised that no zombie walked in there with a car with no oil... Love ya man. we shall call them Crytic-fo-pas
3896 2018-02-07 16:49:33 .@fritinancy you can get an in-depth view thru our podcast, Spotlight 19. Faso has an 80% approval rating from a Koch supported energy nonprofit that shills for the oil industry.
3897 2018-02-07 16:49:13 WTI crude oil falls below $62 as US production jumps. Canadian dollar at session low WTI falls to lowest since January 9
OPEC is curbing production but US shale is exploding. 
Here's is US oil production, which rose by more than 300K barrels per day last week:
3898 2018-02-07 16:49:04 Not if the company decides the economics don’t work with the price of oil. There were indications well before TCPL made the call.

3901 2018-02-07 16:49:00 First correct your English please. CAD was brought down by PCji inspire of $ 140 oil price & global economic melt down. But now FM has breached the fiscal deficit limit weakening India. Every one knows that this govt has messed up the economy while all others are doing well.
3902 2018-02-07 16:48:57 A REAL doctor would have even given you a REAL prescription or told you what you could use over the counter....  I'm REAL SURE Sunflower oil ain't on the list.  ASK ME HOW I KNOW  NEVER HEARD THAT FROM MY DR
3903 2018-02-07 16:48:36 Unbelievably ignorant statement.  Big Texas Oil? So you think small business in AB is unphased by BC's stance on blocking the pipeline?   What is your innovative solution?
3904 2018-02-07 16:48:33 @BCGreens @jjhorgan I really hope you don’t let this Rachel Notley get away with bullying our Province the way she is & you guys fight for what We #BritishColombians voted for let them ship it their oil off their coast oh wait lol
this is our Province & our Country to #canada
3905 2018-02-07 16:48:19 The guest from CAPP is misleading people that a pipeline is “good for Canada”. This is only good for oil companies bottom line which they have a long history of hoarding $ and laying off thousands of Albertans despite yrs of record profits due to ultra low taxes #ableg #BCLeg
3906 2018-02-07 16:48:00 Whale oil was actually used in some car transmissions until 1973.

3907 2018-02-07 16:47:48 They are very good. Put them on stove in cast iron with oil and garlic. Then finish in oven and pour balsamic vinegar over it.
3908 2018-02-07 16:47:45 Get with the program Alberta. Oil is on its way out. Soon to be like coal. Diversify your economy. Surely you have more to offer than oil. NDPers are supposed to see people as our most valuable resource. Healthy educated people create sustainable economies.
3909 2018-02-07 16:47:41 $/CL oil futures possible targets are 60.27ish n 58.50ish
3910 2018-02-07 16:47:39 Ownership of oil fields is determined by whose territory it is in (= iScot). Companies compete & pay Govt to get a licence to explore & extract in defined blocks. They may purchase or lease equipment, invest what they want, but ultimately Govt owns the asset & shares the profits.
3911 2018-02-07 16:47:01 I prescribe not chains when I utter of unity, I prescribe healing, so many have said, laying bare a sudden truth which the world accepts at a pace only relevant to destruction, I carry water, I carry oil, we cannot mix, drop what you hold if it drowns and burns you as it does now
3912 2018-02-07 16:47:00 Chances of US refineries running short of heavy oil ?
3913 2018-02-07 16:46:57 Yes @monicaplowden  we do use sustainably sourced palm oil. We will get that on the FAQ's.
3914 2018-02-07 16:46:53 there was an imabalance around the 65 area but i was too slow and my order didnt get filled :(
3915 2018-02-07 16:46:49 @MrsdogC  please look into cannabis oil there have been a lot of success with this in cancer patients . God bless
3916 2018-02-07 16:46:45 Says the man waiting for sanctions to be lifted to cash in on the Russian oil deal.
3917 2018-02-07 16:46:44 What in the hell is Sunflower oil going to do for Eczema?  Beside make you oily.
3918 2018-02-07 16:46:34 Oil? Not toxic. I'm for a long term drive to clean energy. Short term there is nothing to be done without destroying economy. I.e. your deodorant is made with oil... The tar on roads... Oil... Etc.
3919 2018-02-07 16:46:34 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
3920 2018-02-07 16:46:15 This combo of rain, peppermint oil in my diffuser & the Tylenol PM I took last night got me stuck to my bed.
3921 2018-02-07 16:46:09 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, yet beaten to death with a hammer.
3922 2018-02-07 16:46:05 “Clean” oil and coal doesn’t exist. Easy to be number one at something that’s made up.
3923 2018-02-07 16:46:02 Trudeau should re-introduce the NEP. Force BC to allow the oil pipeline and, in return, force Alberta to sell oil to BC refineries at a price that permits $0.45/litre gasoline in BC. A Judgement of Solomon style solution.
3924 2018-02-07 16:45:58 There’s a difference between highlight and oil lol
3925 2018-02-07 16:45:49 use of cannabis oil for treatment by doctors. no scrips
3926 2018-02-07 16:45:42 The Maduro regime has been killing off its cash cow PDVSA on its own but the human cost for the sanctions, existing and proposed oil imports, should be disastrous for the human beings trying to survive in Venezuela.

3933 2018-02-07 16:44:38 talk about engineering a Political Suicide, Partisan Political tactics are so ignorant, As a leader, you shud unite people, not split province up with a us vs them mentality......We ARE CANADIAN,,,,, not the Wine hippies of BC and the Oil pigs of Alberta....
3934 2018-02-07 16:44:22 Because Trump is and always has been  all about the show, but absolutely zero substance. Unfortunately, too many fall for the show. He is purely a snake oil salesman.
3935 2018-02-07 16:44:05 I understand why Huatli came back with a rock from her planeswalk. its solid proof. but not gonna lie, a little part of me was hoping she'd come back with a scooped up handful of phrexian oil. Phyrexian dinosaurs would be awesome. #magicfiction .
3936 2018-02-07 16:43:58 Please dont think I like Snap!!! i fully agree with you on that one. I just dont see tesla as anything much better than snap.... elon is a snake oil salesman in my opinion.
3937 2018-02-07 16:43:57 If I really say thn Jim Dalton knows nothing but if I want to make money thn Jim Dalton knows everything.. 
Not tagging him cz it would be a disgrace to praise a master on his face like few marketing agents do for the snake oil vendors in India
3938 2018-02-07 16:43:52 @GOP know what to do. They just don’t have the will to do it. Too intoxicated by power. Remember Tillison’s Exxon got $6 billion in tax cuts and he brokered a $5 million?(amount ) oil deal w /Russia against U.S. advice & Sanctions. You tell me who’s unAmerican? #RussianSanctions
3939 2018-02-07 16:43:38 If you arent cool &you want to be president...it helps if your family has a sh*t ton of oil money & middle east connections
3940 2018-02-07 16:43:35 You’d need to purchase 7,300,000 bottles, per day, to match what is being held hostage in oil and causing a discounted price. Per day, assuming a generous $15/bottle.

3947 2018-02-07 16:43:08 Trump approved a tax plan that’s given away BILLIONS in revenue to oil companies while also reducing revenue thru individual reductions. He wants taxpayers 2 buy the wall Mexico was going 2 pay 4, & now wants a military parade. Does anyone wonder why he has so many bankruptcies?
3948 2018-02-07 16:42:57 Trump is a snake oil salesmen for real. Trump is the treasonous.

3955 2018-02-07 16:42:33 This is proven when EU decided to banned palm oil product from Asia/Malaysia. Harey betui.

3959 2018-02-07 16:41:43 The "environmental thing"? Lmfao. Without that whole envionmental thing we will all be dead. Take your head out of the oil sands and educate yourself. Short sightedness at its worst.
3960 2018-02-07 16:41:39 Hmm, #TrumpJongUn and "awareness": like oil and water.
3961 2018-02-07 16:41:30 What kind of sense is ds??who told you to spend of Dabur oil??

3963 2018-02-07 16:41:24 I love cantu shea butter conditioner, organix argan oil, and curl creams from shea moisture! But I also love trying new things 
3964 2018-02-07 16:41:13 Presumably this is why State Department now considering sanctions on Venezuelan oil imports. No imports means sanctions not too disruptive for US refiners
3965 2018-02-07 16:41:11 Jason-Alberta has 3rd WORLDS LARGEST #oil reserve. If you want the SAUDIS to take over the WORLDS market you are in real trouble! Watch the price of oil SKY-ROCKET. 
BTW TANKERS on the coast have  bigger risk for spills than #engineered #pipelines. Your logic makes no sense.

3968 2018-02-07 16:40:49 Will Harvard endowment divest from oil/natural-gas/etc. companies? I recall a "pause" in new investments, but that's different from divesting and no longer investing in such companies.

3970 2018-02-07 16:40:26 A childish response worthy of Donald Trump. The rest of Canada stands with BC: support renewable energy, stop endangering the environment and coastlines with oil spills, and get your head out of the tar sands. Buy more BC wine? Challenge accepted.

3974 2018-02-07 16:40:22 Don’t have an independent oil analysis. But watching for the signs of cycle roll-over. Furthermore, oil has to keep going up to sustain the secular reflation thesis.

3978 2018-02-07 16:40:08 Good article. I remember the study. I am not saying it's a clean industry.

I am saying shutting it down and crippling western Canada is not currently a realistic idea. Nor does it accomplish any sort of reduction in oil use.
3979 2018-02-07 16:40:00 It's only the beginning. I'm trying to find a good time to rollover from CLH8 to CLJ8. I have to wait another week to get that chance. Either way, it's all good. I can't wait to see what Jimboman has in stored for us in terms of arrows.

3981 2018-02-07 16:39:59 oh cmon, Jaclyn. should they applaud the guy who just gave billions to the richest people? really? besides it's their right not to. trump is a snake oil salesman.
3982 2018-02-07 16:39:58 Nak tanya.. Sedap ke bau tea tree oil ?
3983 2018-02-07 16:39:57 Oil mill.
3984 2018-02-07 16:39:55 They send out the funds through their partners/business men in Iran to overseas & invest it in various ventures. The head of Sepah also cashing funds from selling oil in back market through business men who travel overseas on commission basis. There is more funds going out hidden
3985 2018-02-07 16:39:47 Is this what it’s like to be a hand model? 

“Okay Sally, today for your shoot I’m gonna need you to rub this red eye shadow and oil for a good 30 seconds all over your hands. Make it good so we don’t have to reshoot! Don’t forget to show those stellar palms!”
3986 2018-02-07 16:39:36 This might be an unpopular opinion, but if we’re going to protest how oil is moved around (like pipelines) we should also protest how oil is used (like highway one).

I do, by the way. I protest highway one. Nobody seems to listen or care.
3987 2018-02-07 16:39:35 Today’s wash day and I’m sooooooo excited. I’m long overdue for a hot oil treatment.
3988 2018-02-07 16:39:34 just need a good distraction, like a can of olive oil
3989 2018-02-07 16:39:34 If he left an empty treasury,from which money did Buhari use to bail out states dat needed 2 pay salaries & also fork out N400b for oil marketers?.
3990 2018-02-07 16:39:26 is not oil, it is condensates, which is not the same than crude oil
3991 2018-02-07 16:39:17 Also I definitely read “Jaxxon” with the exact same accentuation as I read the word “Exxon” (like the oil company)
3992 2018-02-07 16:39:06 So is Kenya going to borrow from the Nigerian playbook by exporting crude & importing refined oil?
3993 2018-02-07 16:39:05 I don't think they see it as a threat, more as an opportunity. They'll still be selling oil, but can tap into other energy markets too
3994 2018-02-07 16:39:03 A fair point but if we are being completely honest, the Oilers did much of that to themselves.
3995 2018-02-07 16:38:58 My dad was a service manager for Honda and I used to get oil changed every 5000 miles, but he said that the oil life in the car is accurate and to just change it when that gets low
3996 2018-02-07 16:38:49 When will idiots like you learn, THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS CLEAN OIL OR CLEAN COAL. You believe what suits.
3997 2018-02-07 16:38:29 So to defend multi billion $$ oil you boycott small business? And an industry that has little to nothing to do with energy? Petty. And kind of stupid.
3998 2018-02-07 16:38:27 A decade of Harper and tar sands oil... Canada already had it's Trump.

4005 2018-02-07 16:37:33 Well then I guess it’s a good thing we are about to destroy our public lands and pollute our oceans to get oil that will pollute the air. Oh and lucky coal is comming back.

4022 2018-02-07 16:36:30 Today I had to chose, heating oil or new glasses and exam needed since September. Heating oil won. I can’t stand all this winning!
4023 2018-02-07 16:36:22 Thanks man! That was the first oil painting I ever did! 
4024 2018-02-07 16:36:15 Thanks for that Bel. Just wish BahamasPet could be added to it at some point, haha.
4025 2018-02-07 16:36:14 If you had ANY brain, you would know that there IS clean oil. NO energy is completely non-polluting but oil is one of the best with the regulations that have been put in place
4026 2018-02-07 16:36:12 I just donated a soy sauce bottle to the oil painting classroom. For posterity. And still lifes.
4027 2018-02-07 16:36:08 Yes! Oil rigs not only look better but they add that nice rainbow shean and petrol aroma to the water. If you want to be energy independent (a stupid talking point because we produce more oil than almost anybody) then maybe we should be looking for clean ways to produce it.

4031 2018-02-07 16:35:49 @weatherchannel  Come on you guys! You're talking about 6" of snow in New Hampshire like it's Armageddon. Those people don't care if they get 6" of snow it's no big deal, you are becoming the snake oil salesmen of weather. It's all about self promotion, and it's a shame.
4032 2018-02-07 16:35:41 The American military uses 550,000 barrels of oil per day and wherever Donald Trump flies on Air Force One, they send another 747 as decoy? Until they start to address such matters, your odd saved trip in your car isn't going to make a jot of difference, sadly, but good luck!
4033 2018-02-07 16:35:40 I haven't taken a full day in ages over one single painting. I've missed it and sometimes I don't know why I just can't take a seat and do it.. man once I graduate I am def up to joining an oil live-painting class or something. Gotta shake that rust off..!

4043 2018-02-07 16:34:43 Your backing for BC's proposed immediate end to AB oil sales with no transition plan or change management is unfortunate. BC's commitment to continue buying & burning oil is dishonest. BC's announced LNG plant is duplicitous. An overarching strategy is needed #cdnpoli @Tzeporah

4072 2018-02-07 16:31:10 Today, an important grade of Canadian oil (#WCS), is selling for $33.21 USD. 

That’s $30 USD less than the main North American benchmark (WTI) at $63.21 USD

Canadian natural gas (#AECO) is selling for $1.11 CAD, vs. US natural gas (NYMEX) at $2.72 USD. @PremierScottMoe #cdnpoli
4073 2018-02-07 16:30:52 Yeah - never mix acid and oil....
4074 2018-02-07 16:30:51 2. They left because shale is cheaper to refine than heavy crude oil. Now! Shell sold their site to CNRL.. so really there isn’t a loss. Alberta is in the process of looking for shale.
4075 2018-02-07 16:30:46 Oh Alberta  
You have to move forward just like the rest of the world.

My wine stock is almost exclusively BC made, I think we can all drink 14% more this year to keep our wilderness free of oil spills.

LOL that BC & Alberta share a representative eh, Canada?

4099 2018-02-07 16:28:13 @RapeseedOilFans I’ve been using rapeseed oil in my cooking for years and I’m so glad that it’s becoming so popular. I love frying chicken, home made chicken dippers, homemade fish fingers etc in British butter mixed with rapeseed oil it makes the meat golden yellow and yummy!
4100 2018-02-07 16:28:11 As we’ve been tweeting oil has done nothing but confirm a head & shoulder top.  You’ll see in a few months how you were wrong, but for now all you will do is keep the personal bias and not consider others words.
4101 2018-02-07 16:28:02 The Forties oil pipeline - which connects dozens of North Sea oil and gas installations with the mainland - has been shut down after an incident involving a valve at the Kinneil gas plant.

Bravo.
4140 2018-02-07 16:24:26 Yeah definitely one cup for me. I usually do a tablespoon of butter and  a tablespoon of coconut oil. Occasionally I switch it up and use a tablespoon of mct oil and a tablespoon of heavy whipping cream.

4146 2018-02-07 16:23:58 Pipelines are monitored and maintained by the company. Leaks are cleaned up by the company. Transporting oil by train has a much higher risk of mishap and with more dire consequences for the environment, property damage and human safety. Lac Magantic is a lesson.

4153 2018-02-07 16:23:16 I wish my country (Australia) would at least attempt to get way from coal and oil, especially with the fact that the country is known for its Heat and Sun, Why? Australia you're not even trying, get your shit together

4157 2018-02-07 16:22:32 Se vc tem interesse no cargo, por favor, compareça à recepção do Lucas Oil portando CV, Carteira de Identidade e Carteira de Trabalho amanha as 08:00. hahahahaha
4158 2018-02-07 16:22:30 Let's just say right now, retired oil executives make miserably inept,  Secretaries of State.
4159 2018-02-07 16:22:10 DOW recovered everything lost, yesterday, and the trading day is not nearly over. OIL, GAs, Gold, and Silver prices are down, commodities like Corn are higher due to crop losses from global cooling
4160 2018-02-07 16:22:08 Thanks Mr Berman. The equity route has smashed oil further and further away from the yield curve mean, for the time being.
4161 2018-02-07 16:22:06 Eeeeeeeeish, and i just drove past the store waitse , I'll get fanta grape and olive oil from the garage 
4162 2018-02-07 16:22:06 My house is in that picture (not the oil refinery).

dying a little?
but also, i love the voidfish. And just jellyfish in general.
now ill have a painting of a jellyfish in oil, acrylic, and watercolor! Im doin the trifecta of jelly yea
4165 2018-02-07 16:22:02 Some of the stolen oil may have gone to Israel, but I think much of it ended up in Turkey.
4166 2018-02-07 16:22:01 No one uses teak oil around here. Everyone hates it for some reason
4167 2018-02-07 16:22:00 Last year, Americans annihilated 3,650,000,000 barrels of crude oil ... gone forever never to be replaced. What's to show for those three-plus billion barrels? 

Good news all right!
4168 2018-02-07 16:21:48 And this is the whole point.  POTUS sends his congrats on the launch while he ignores & undermines Musk's much more significant successes in clean energy cars.  Maybe now he'll pay attention 2 US innovation instead of coddling oil & coal companies in name of "jobs" (what a laugh)
4169 2018-02-07 16:21:44 とりあえず寝ような……折原輝の死生観はなんとなく分かるようで上手く言語化できないもどかしさというか……こんな感じかなっていうのは分かるんだけど……私とは全然違うから難しい……
4170 2018-02-07 16:21:33 I'm not counting them out just yet. I think we will look back on this season and ask why the schedule was the way that it was because the Central and Metro made the Oilers look a lot worse than they were.
4171 2018-02-07 16:21:30 That's a good thing. 
It would be better to more such teams. 
Japan was too closed..
They should release the market and activities!;)
4172 2018-02-07 16:21:30 Sure but they are going to have to lose somewhere along they way...it's just a matter of where...pick your poison. Like I said, w/ the 3pt games,  it's a near impossible ask.
4173 2018-02-07 16:21:25 Como te digo antes, Tesla cotiza en bolsa. Me parece que si bien le he escuchado comentarios colectivistas, no empaña para nada lo que ha logrado. Tesla no necesita ninguna regulación, el oil se va a acabar, es tan sencillo como eso.
4174 2018-02-07 16:21:22 ok it is completely unacceptable to leave the review "this smells like a crab boil" on a culty facial oil that comes in three different scents, and not specify which of the three scents smells like crab boil

4180 2018-02-07 16:21:04 Typical my last sale comes back the next day because a technician put the wrong oil in OOF
4181 2018-02-07 16:20:57 He said millions were joining health association plans. That was false. Also his flip flopping on DACA was impressive. Admit it, you were sold snake oil
4182 2018-02-07 16:20:54 Y will any sane person ever take you serious? You are just an aggrieved person always rambling.
4183 2018-02-07 16:20:51 So they can sell more oil
4184 2018-02-07 16:20:45 I gotta get my car inspected and my oil change before my car blows up 
4185 2018-02-07 16:20:43 @RaptorBurger What type of oil do you use in your fryers?
4186 2018-02-07 16:20:41 And this is the whole point.  POTUS sends his congrats on the launch while he ignores & undermines ur much more significant successes in clean energy cars.  Maybe now he'll pay attention to US innovation instead of coddling oil & coal companies in name of "jobs" (what a laugh).
4187 2018-02-07 16:20:33 I can offer you olive oil for the low
4188 2018-02-07 16:20:33 But investing in oil infrastructure with a 40–60 year life is not "getting off oil." There's a bullet to be bitten and, being human, we are bending over backwards not to bite it now.
4189 2018-02-07 16:20:29 Why don't we offer to pay for the study and put in protection for the BC coast? It's going to take a couple years to build the pipeline. We can do the study in parallel. It's our oil, we should take responsibility for any spills and cleanup. Leave BC wine out of it.@CBCEyeopener

4191 2018-02-07 16:20:20 We're not there yet. Hoping it doesn't happen. I can't find out anything on Russian oil exports but notice oil VIX high. Wonder if there's a relationship
4192 2018-02-07 16:20:17 Looks like that McDonalds  oil doesn’t work on everyone. 
4193 2018-02-07 16:20:12 it's not laughable to believe, doubtful yes, but laughable no. the point is we're not out of it as of today. we might be soon, but there is still a chance. It's okay to believe they won't and it's okay to believe they will.
4194 2018-02-07 16:20:06 Chopra should hv knowledge about crude oil price, refining expenses, exchange rate and State Sales Tax.

4195 2018-02-07 16:20:05 finally bought the dip in oil. hopefully i can take part in the oil rally too.
0 fundies, i know very little abt oil and clearly so does the market too lol

4198 2018-02-07 16:19:50 Then why do they need subsidies & tax breaks & at what cost to the environment? We should be opening wind & solar farms & manufacturing. But you have to keep those $ coming into your campaign from oil & gas industries while you sell off our lands. #Carl2018
4199 2018-02-07 16:19:30 It is either you know what our fiscal/monetary position was, crash in international crude oil, mismanagement of our collective wealth and you chose to be ignorant of it or you don't know at all, you are just happy bag of rice and PMS were 8k and 87N respectively.

4209 2018-02-07 16:18:47 I made some with sea salt, water, and coconut oil. Need to get a spray bottle to apply it though - today I just soaked it and then towel dried.
4210 2018-02-07 16:18:45 Yes, which is where they have to correct their ways. If they continue to do everything that they have done EXCEPT losing to the Buffalos and Detroits of the league, they will be able to make some hay.

4221 2018-02-07 16:17:57 I’ve talked to my parents about it and my dad suggests hemp oil  and my mom said if things start to get really bad with my anxiety we’ll look into it over the summer 
4222 2018-02-07 16:17:56 she prayed for me, anointed my right palm with Oliver oil. I politely asked her about her husband, she said he travelled to India that day. I thanked her, stood up and left. That was the last time I visited any prophet/seer for anything or even called for prayers.
4223 2018-02-07 16:17:52 And its typical US hipocracy.  Russia is the biggest supplier of hydrocarbons to the 2 biggest econs. in the world (the EU & China) & it gets mocked for being a petro state. But the US produces some oil & it's an energy revolution ! Yeehaw.

4236 2018-02-07 16:17:07 This oil is for export from possibly the biggest environmental disaster on planet earth. Yet Canada is importing oil at the same time it is exporting. Building refineries right beside the oil sands and Canadian's consuming a Canadian product would at least make sense.
4237 2018-02-07 16:17:02 Yeke!!! Tapi if concernkan scar dia more to alpha arbutin,nia ni mcm control oil sebum and ada la sikit concern whitening-
4238 2018-02-07 16:16:59 The approval process was a sham, with a stacked deck in favor of the filthy oil sands companies.

4241 2018-02-07 16:16:21 Beating good teams & asking them to essentially run the table against them are two different things. If we use that logic, should the expectation not be for them to continue to struggle against supposed "lesser" sides?

4247 2018-02-07 16:15:48 This is more a tale of not over consuming only one ingredient - eat a balanced diet. In addition, simply pick oils that have not been stripped of all naturally-present nutrients, especially tocopherol (vitamin E) compounds. #extrusion and mech. oil pressing leave the nutrients.
4248 2018-02-07 16:15:45 Jesus on a pony, he is big oil’s bitch, of course he would say this shit

4261 2018-02-07 16:13:59 Yeah Oilers don't beat good teams so I can see your point.
4262 2018-02-07 16:13:59 This final shakeout in crude oil should provide a wonderful buying opportunity in crude stocks, the offshore drillers and the frack related stocks.
4263 2018-02-07 16:13:58 That record is basically built on beating the Flames, who they own, Arizona. You can add Vegas as well but it's hard to count the game they won at home against their 4th & 5th string netminder.
4264 2018-02-07 16:13:57 Yekeeee kak iman? Bukan coconut oil bagus utk buang minyak kat muka ke
4265 2018-02-07 16:13:48 Especially because we now get more revenue from rising prices when we export our crude oil.
4266 2018-02-07 16:13:30 First see if there's oil b4 u start bugging...

4271 2018-02-07 16:12:49 Oil prices looking toppy  and news that US production is back above 10mbd , up 1.3mbd in past year, has prompted more selling. Good news for consumer but less so for @ecb unless @euro falls.
4272 2018-02-07 16:12:26 To date, oil increased much more than the 2.50 imposed by TRAIN Law since Jan 1. To blame inflation on tax reform solely is grossly inaccurate
4273 2018-02-07 16:12:18 Don't accept any wooden nickels or the word of a snake oil salesman like Trump #WednesdayWisdom
4274 2018-02-07 16:12:14 oil sucks indeed. Frackers alive and well
4275 2018-02-07 16:12:06 (FTR I’m not opposed to essential oil usage I just think we need far more transparency in what’s in them and research into safe usage, like any medivation.)
4276 2018-02-07 16:12:06 Also, the fact everyone keeps bringing up all their games against the Pacific is laughable. Yes, their record is good but to expect that same % to continue over the rest of the season isn't realistic. And don't forget they have only played ANA, SJ & LA once each to this point
4277 2018-02-07 16:11:47 Bahrain has arrested a “terrorist group” in connection with an attack on an oil pipeline in November last year. The Interior Ministry said in a statement that two of the suspects were trained at a camp in Iran affiliated to the Revolutionary Guard.
4278 2018-02-07 16:11:41 Doubt it beats Shell's North Sea Oil game.
4279 2018-02-07 16:11:34 i wish my mom never found essential oils. i have a sore throat and she was like “use this oil and you need to eat better” 
1. that oil is disgusting and i’m not putting it in my mouth 
2. I EAT THE MEALS SHE MAKES so 
4280 2018-02-07 16:11:31 Now as far as OIL $CL any intraday bounce just needs to be contained to <63, digest and then we should see a 5handle.

4287 2018-02-07 16:11:20 The big big move up in oil production to 10.25 mln BPD weekly would put us at a new all-time production record for the US - which was foretold when the EIA Nov figures came out and we were a scant 6,000 barrels short of the monthly record. #OOTT

4293 2018-02-07 16:10:30 That is still a long way off and there are thousands of families that are hurting right now. Let's get the province up and running again and then mandate the oil companies start investing and researching green energy. We can't just cut it off or leave it as is.
4294 2018-02-07 16:10:25 You're wrong. At 40 oil is bullish. Now its bearish. You're repeating false narratives. Tell Pierce Andurand to hire better PR people to spread his narratives.
4295 2018-02-07 16:10:25 But should NY be suing those that use the oil instead of those that produce it? Airlines who fly over NY must be contributing a lot to the damage.

I don’t really see a need for increased oil production. 75% of the oil is used for gasoline in cars, and with our modern technology, we will be able to drive electric cars. Tesla is already selling models so eventually gas powered cars will be outdated

As the per Law of Entropy, to justify Dow at 25000, crude oil needs to be at $5-10 per barrel.

As a reminder, only Jesus Christ overcame the law of entropy with death and resurrection. We humans have not overcome that yet.

4424 2018-02-07 15:59:49 #RGM is making its move ...too low a price ...consider Cobalt + Coal + Oil + Gas   +franchise with "White Cars   "Tesla hire up market vehicles + maybe discount to hire for #RGM investors 
4425 2018-02-07 15:59:46 Oil prices 
4426 2018-02-07 15:59:44 "you can buy but you can't trade" - just like every piece of shit private placement on the OTC grey market. It is what it is. They are called unregistered securities for a reason, and its usually not the one being sold to you by the snake oil salesman calling the unknown phone #
4427 2018-02-07 15:59:43 This time so last year I was cutting up coconut and learning to make oil down.
I want to go home

4433 2018-02-07 15:59:11 Orrr does he go to the salon and they do it for him? And what does he do to get such shine? Moroccan oil? Copious amounts of Wen??? I need to know!
4434 2018-02-07 15:59:09 @jimcramer I know it has not come down so much, but what are your thoughts on oil and SLB?  I was waiting to get in, and this seems like a reasonable time?
4435 2018-02-07 15:59:01 Holy moley I will be in seventh heaven if I read that #SAA/#Russia take back the oil.
4436 2018-02-07 15:58:39 That could be pretty sexy.

4439 2018-02-07 15:58:31 i think this time it will take longer before a crash as wall street will fund shale oil producers more cautiously. also market will be managed till ipo of Saudi Aramco

4446 2018-02-07 15:57:24 If oil finish we going mad max in this country
4447 2018-02-07 15:57:06 We're talking science fiction here. Alberta has less political influence than any major oil company. Neither will do anything to destabilize existing markets. As well, there really is no political will. Alberta just doesn't have much spunk anymore. This is an impotent fantasy.
4448 2018-02-07 15:56:59 These charts published so quickly are terrific. Most focus on 10.0 mm b/d+ oil prod but inventories shrinking despite this

4452 2018-02-07 15:56:28 Talking about imported stuff specifically fragrance.. 

If it's 'parfum' and it's naturally blend.. It will cost you hundreds to thousands of dollars 

Depending on the essential oil used, manufacturing date (longer is better), and brand itself 

#educateothers
4453 2018-02-07 15:56:25 re facial products I'd recommend Korean brands. they're lighter, less oily. Western brands tend to be oil heavy and suck for tropical climates
4454 2018-02-07 15:56:18 Lol I hate waiting! I’ve done oil tho but not the Saran
4455 2018-02-07 15:56:12 The quote doesn’t reflect the fullness of his message. His point is we should build the pipeline because jobs and to get oil to the people who want to buy it. And, as ever, it’s all JT’s fault.
4456 2018-02-07 15:56:10 Do you like their rose water? I just ordered it but I heard that it stings some people’s eyes. I LOVE body hero! The shower oil is . The lotion is meh, it’s not really made for black girl moisture levels in my opinion. It’s a lotion for people who don’t really like lotion
4457 2018-02-07 15:56:09 I used regular coconut oil and had two cups and I think it made me a bit queasy. Maybe it's a one cup treat?

4460 2018-02-07 15:55:59 If BC doesn't like oil why do they keep importing it, If you wanted to be honest BC is breaking the law and subverting the constitution, but hey lets blame Alberta
4461 2018-02-07 15:55:57 Don’t cover the pan. Put enough oil so that it’s shallow in the pan :)
4462 2018-02-07 15:55:54 oil -> shower -> bud -> coffee
4463 2018-02-07 15:55:51 Yes! :) Please order thin noodles with it (our thick noodles have egg). However, please be aware that the tofu furai is fried in the same oil as our other dishes.

4465 2018-02-07 15:55:47 Ei tule tapahtumaan. Kaikki menettää merkityksensä. We take everything seriously, especially the fish oil.
4466 2018-02-07 15:55:30 If there is a hell, then there is a very special level of it reserved for snake oil salesmen like you and your wife.
4467 2018-02-07 15:55:29 Here's some winning 4 u. In your great state of Ark. my family has own several acres of land. late90s they began wells 4 oil & nat. gas.
We lease to them. Under BO royalties dropped drasticly! Under 45 up up up up! No joke folks!
4468 2018-02-07 15:55:24 I went to the oil change place and they told me I was good and didn't need one..... uhm... that doesn't happen, he didn't even try to sell me a filter and he topped me off for free. I'm deceased.
4469 2018-02-07 15:55:24 I’m just sayin, I can tell they’re stressed out and need a lil TLC and Blessed oil. I want em to know Sean cares 
4470 2018-02-07 15:55:11 Canes fans on my TL talking about fire Rumph need to drink motor oil. He a damn good CB coach those kids left South FL for their own reasons
4471 2018-02-07 15:55:09 you d.i.c.k. - there is no such thing as clean oil and definitely no clean coal. or will the coal miners will get clean black lungs too? Just because your pussygrabing moron in chief says crap like that - it doesn't make it a real thing.
4472 2018-02-07 15:54:54 LOL! You aren’t very educated on the issues of oil and coal, are you?
4473 2018-02-07 15:54:52 7-Oil from unknown source is a con (he doesn't understand ESS isn't about Revenue)

8-Our £5.5bn food/drink exports can cover the loss of any fiscal transfer (we already get the benefit of that!)

9-Indyref was not a free and fair vote (I know...)

4474 2018-02-07 15:54:50 I just heard the @POTUS budget cuts renewable energy subsidies more than 70%. Supporting fossil fuels, taking us further back, while China surges ahead.  The argument -- oil and gas need a level playing field.  Really?
4475 2018-02-07 15:54:46 or would the ageing Fiat Panda of oil pipelines be closer?
4476 2018-02-07 15:54:45 Not a single oil and gas company on that list. Interesting.
4477 2018-02-07 15:54:45 Hush, you and have a McGriddle. 
4478 2018-02-07 15:54:37 Another thing us southern people did. If a car developed a bad cylinder, we simple removed the piston and rod, Drove a tight post in that cylinder, removed the push rods, spark plug wire, put the oil pan back on and valve cover kept trucking.

4480 2018-02-07 15:54:32 I tend to stay away from stuff like this but have always had a problem with how Burriws conducts himself. For him to react they way he did, at this stage in his career & for what was as clean a hit as you'll see, is pathetic. He should be embarrassed.
4481 2018-02-07 15:54:27 So if #Venezuela is only avg 431K b/d of crude oil to the US in 2018, just how bad are things for a country that relies on oil revenues?  #Amuaydown #Itisnotatumah
4482 2018-02-07 15:54:15 The oil industry was doing poorly before they were elected and the conservative did nothing about this while they were in power. The NDP cannot be solely to blame here
4483 2018-02-07 15:54:09 I really doubt that. So much stuff you never even think about is from China. And contains oil.

It's the same old NIMBY attitude. I want my modern lifestyle but only other people's countries should be used to gather the resources.

He turns up, looks at our sensor measuring oil levels, says its knackered and we have no oil. Doh

4511 2018-02-07 15:51:00 The fact that #CapeTown is running out of water (main reservoir has 12% capacity left) should be jolting the world. #FreshWater has long been called the next oil, and slowly that is what it is becoming.

4553 2018-02-07 15:47:49 There has never (that I can find).been an oil tanker spill in BC tidal waters...ever.
4554 2018-02-07 15:47:49 The current Trans Mountain Pipeline has been in operation on the very same route as the expansion since 1953! How many major devastating oil spills have there been over that time? Do BC residents even know that they've been transporting oil under their feet for the past 65 years?
4555 2018-02-07 15:47:30 Seems different to the sense I’m getting on the ground. Think just as the media twists the truth the pollsters do too. Why are they going on about this now? Things going swimmingly on May & Brexit front? SNP getting on with the day job & that nuisance oil with finds/price rises?

4566 2018-02-07 15:46:55 The economy has been on the rise for quite sometime it is all the other disasters you have done e.g. reversing all the environmental protections Obama put into law,letting oil companies drill in National Parks & Arctic Refuge & turning all the Elmer Fudds loose on your wildlife
4567 2018-02-07 15:46:53 And that's probably where all that oil is going to end up, on Canada's west coast, along with Japan's nuclear power plant's radiation spill.

4569 2018-02-07 15:46:46 That’s not including the Flank Plays at Petisovci and the potential deeper oil/gas reservoirs. Also maybe add in EOR on the field as a whole!... And we are well north of the above figures surely @colhutch ???... #AST
4570 2018-02-07 15:46:43 It's ridiculous haha. #EIA showed build now (BUT way less than the EXPECTED build)... Crude 1.859MM vs. Exp. 3.189MM... & DRAW in Cushing... #Oil $CL_F rips down to 62.50 -.89 -1.4%?! #API surprised but #EIA draw < expected is a surprise too, shouldn't shock price... opportunity.

4659 2018-02-07 15:39:37 The US produces 40% of its oil. The rest comes from Canada, the ME, and other exporters.

4702 2018-02-07 15:36:20 We don’t need to rely on foreign oil if we invest in new energy technology. Dems support investments in solar, water, and wind energy, because oil and coal are limited resources. Not sure it’s liberals who are ignorant in this debate.
4703 2018-02-07 15:36:17 Quebec does have oil.  I think they are killing Alberta energy to replace it with Quebec’s.

4710 2018-02-07 15:35:52 From your own article: .48% of new sales are EV. Yes, you are living in a fantasy world. 
Once you add in trucks for shipping, boats, liners, planes, etc... I think you finally get why it is a needle in a haystack proposition. World oil useage won't peak until 2050 - or later.

You can't just add the word 'clean' and make it so.

4854 2018-02-07 15:25:48 Oil & gas drilling should be slowly shifted towards cleaner energy investments/opportunities.

4870 2018-02-07 15:24:24 I stumble into general dentistry, partially blinded by snow. My hair and sweatpants are sopping wet, a nerve in my 1st bicuspid tooth is completely exposed, and I’m holding a quart of 5W-30 motor oil in either hand.

Onlookers watch. Whatever’s happened to me, it’s been hell.
4871 2018-02-07 15:24:11 No oil or treatment can tame this frizz. 
4872 2018-02-07 15:24:02 They fixed those leaks on the 1st then 3rd and on the 6th where back at it with more oil leaks.. I will never buy another dodge.. I will trade all 4 of my trucks in and buy Ford's.

4972 2018-02-07 15:14:58 Putting Blessed Olive Oil by any Christian on the doors and windows of our White House or any Capital of a State or Church and pray would also bless this nation and anoint our Home land and any evil spirit will have to obey it or perish, Scripture say's!
4973 2018-02-07 15:14:53 Lucky who ever get this. Coconut oil so Good
4974 2018-02-07 15:14:41 yahhhhh nemu pula ini yg namanya Haple face oil... 
4975 2018-02-07 15:14:39 i got a water bottle, idk where y’all want me to get some baby oil from lmaoo
4976 2018-02-07 15:14:35 Too many ultra wealthy oil companies don't want efficient energy, they want dependence on oil to last forever to keep the billions of $ rolling in 
4977 2018-02-07 15:14:31 Clean oil?
4978 2018-02-07 15:14:21 Selama ini selow aja minum obat/vit sampe akhirnya dapet vit DHA dr obgyn yg isinya fish oil. Amisnya sampe kebawa pas serdawa. Mau nelen sampe ditimang2 dulu tuh kapsul 
4979 2018-02-07 15:14:19 Gotcha! I think the risk is ending up like Trinidad - living through a oil heyday and not sustainably investing the profits for the long term.

4982 2018-02-07 15:13:56 This lady smells like she douses herself in oil sheen daily.

4984 2018-02-07 15:13:43 Ah, nice.  Good plan.  And I know you check to make sure it makes oil pressure before you really start it, so I wasn't actually worried.

4987 2018-02-07 15:13:26 Clean oil and Coal??? Are we makeing things up? Not a Dr. But when you burn coal it makes a black smoke...Now my solar panels don't do anything just sits there and I get electricity out of it. Just spit balling here.
4988 2018-02-07 15:13:24 This scarcity has gone on for too long for God sake. Even countries who do not have crude oil do not experience fuel scarcity this long.
4989 2018-02-07 15:13:12 Anarchy is being brought on by those who believe they can bargain with the climate for one more hit, one more oil boom fuelled shot in the arm, so that maybe then we can afford to work on climate change, on the environment. An addict's behaviour...

4995 2018-02-07 15:13:04 It's happening...remember it starts with someone somewhat legally elected. They start taking away our privileges and attack the free press. They exploit divisions and schisms and oil it all down with lucrative deals to those who go along. We cannot be good Germans!

5001 2018-02-07 15:12:57 You just removed any shred of doubt ... clean oil and coal ... 
5002 2018-02-07 15:12:47 totally opposite but I once had a debate in one thread. The use of olive oil. lol
5003 2018-02-07 15:12:46 Plus France already has all the resources they need, as Total owns about half the oil and gas in Africa.
5004 2018-02-07 15:12:45 Almost certainly. Maybe a bit of oil dissolved in the expensive stuff, but nothing you can't get yourself, I'd wager.
5005 2018-02-07 15:12:44 China bought ANWR Arctic national wildlife refuge here in Alaska after 40 or fight of keeping the Worlds largest untouched pristine sanctuary we lost The fight and now they are drilling for oil inside ANWR And offshore arctic drilling! Against the will of the people!

5010 2018-02-07 15:12:21 You do know that this is nonsense don’t you?  

In 2016/17 the UK had revenues of £724bn. Oil made up £208 million of that. That’s 0.28% of revenue
5011 2018-02-07 15:12:20 @makepisi_ and here I was thinking guys don't use coconut oil.  
5012 2018-02-07 15:12:18 Dumber and dumber every day, Liddle Jizzy Jake. That's what Trump Love does to you. That said, you started out at a disadvantage with your dad's DNA. My point? There is NO SUCH THING as clean coal or oil. If you think there is, you're just plain stupid. Again.
5013 2018-02-07 15:12:11 Clean oil and gas!!!!!??? Hahahaha you just made my morning!

5016 2018-02-07 15:12:05 Don't you think all such issues shud be made public by press conferences of respective cabinet ministers. Like oil deal with Iran, why does t oil minister come and say it in public to give authentication to such stories.
5017 2018-02-07 15:11:57 Someone slap the dung out of this woman! Oil is renewable! And if we don't use it there will be oil swamps around the world!

So SAD!

5023 2018-02-07 15:11:40 How I asked my dad to take my car to the shop for my oil change and he tells me he can’t and calls me rn asking why I’m late because he’s there and he doesn’t see my car.  REALLY DAD 
5024 2018-02-07 15:11:18 Clean oil and coal??? There is no such thing.

You realize most of the world is striving to lead in renewables, and you’re saying we should be proud of “clean oil and coal”. 

How did we get here
5028 2018-02-07 15:11:04 Clean oil and coal is a misnomer, they do not exist.
5029 2018-02-07 15:10:55 "Although profitability is always a key metric, in the oil and gas industry, growth in production and reserves has often been more important....."

5030 2018-02-07 15:10:49 Clean oil n coal? Lol
5031 2018-02-07 15:10:41 Industry oil & gas ada 3 parts. Upstream, midstream, downstream. Upstream focus on exploration and carigali, midstream on pipelines, logistics and distribution, downstream on penapisan minyak mentah or processing natural gas.

5036 2018-02-07 15:10:20 So much funny shit going on  like what she had in that cup? Some fucking vegetable oil 
5037 2018-02-07 15:10:18 Well, you’re only half right. Pipelines are the safest way, but bitumen has to be diluted and become dilbit to go in a pipeline, which is much worse if spilt than normal bitumen. Whereas bitumen shipped by rail has less impact if spilt and refined oil shipped by pipe is easier.
5038 2018-02-07 15:10:12 I can’t be bothered with oil changes and all that other car maintenance crap

5042 2018-02-07 15:09:53 Your critics remind me of Judas telling Jesus that the expensive oil Mary anointed him with could have been sold and given to the poor (even though he had no intention of giving to the poor). There is a time to  put our national pride on display in honor of our military! 
5043 2018-02-07 15:09:53 Shey even the ones that sell black market are into oil and gas
5044 2018-02-07 15:09:49 I’m at Disney now lathered in coconut oil by the pool during the most stressful week of the Hs season.
5045 2018-02-07 15:09:41 Before you start making sweeping proclamations about me you damn sure better sport. Sin is an imaginary disease contrived to sell an equally imaginary cure in snake oil Jesus. God is imaginary. Bottom line. Period. Prove me wrong genius. (and don't quote the bible)
5046 2018-02-07 15:09:38 Clean oil and coal? I wonder if you're just pretending to be stupid. You have me fooled.
5047 2018-02-07 15:09:29 #BCWine  so the child running the province of Alberta is  going to band our BC wines in Alberta, well BC people we should run all Alberta people back to their dirty shit province,so they can’t drink our wines here.let them go home and drink their crude oil they call Alberta wine.
5048 2018-02-07 15:09:28 I won't - that's why I've left the oil cap off!
5049 2018-02-07 15:09:20 Nice to see you working on the crown jewel of the American interior. Our most sacred and proud monument. A shining example of priority. Now, if it only produced oil.

5060 2018-02-07 15:08:35 There is no such thing as clean coal or oil. Solar energy is clean. The American citizens are smarter than you think.
5061 2018-02-07 15:08:30 Gross  underpricing of the social cost of carbon and other externalities. Forgone increased margin to oil shippers does not mean a net loss to society at large. The shipped oil will be burned without any carbon price. Facilitating pipelines is a subsidy. It’s a  negative CTax

5072 2018-02-07 15:07:18 Oil is 140cals per tbl.  A stir fry will have oil in the initial fry and most likely in the sauce. I’m guessing that’s where it comes from. 3x500 cal meals a day is probably close to your bmr unless you’re really small.

5084 2018-02-07 15:05:56 WM takes 92% of scots oil and gas revenue,,thats the threat right there Ron
SNP are seen as a threat to WM keeping taking that 92%
5085 2018-02-07 15:05:43 Would you both please understand how the market works.  Also, Trump highlights it when it goes up but is silent when it goes down.  This tweet is just another marketing ploy by him.  More snake oil.
5086 2018-02-07 15:05:41 I can't wait!  You've come this far; don't forget to put oil back in!  ;-)
5087 2018-02-07 15:05:40 This is not a lose lose situation.  Pipeline = big oil wins, BC loses.  No pipeline = environment wins and we move forward as leaders in alternatives to oil.  This is our chance to make the world better for the next gen.
5088 2018-02-07 15:05:39 You are a charlatan. @POTUS has no idea how the economy works. He was a carnival barker as a businessman, selling snake oil to the mases.

we used to get 100$.
why the fuck should we empty our oil for no money at all?

5200 2018-02-07 14:54:04 Both of you, get your act together and cut this out. The pipeline was approved and it is wrong for BC to dispute this now. Alberta needs to move that oil and all that's happening is an enlargement of the size of the pipeline, it is not following a different path.

5202 2018-02-07 14:53:15 Alberta will have other options to sell oil with keystone. Would they really hurt that bad if they stopped supplying our oil? BC is a small % market compared to other markets.

5207 2018-02-07 14:52:49 The siren is a regular test to make sure it’s working.
When we had the oil depot if something went wrong or there was a glass leak the siren would go off for real.
5208 2018-02-07 14:52:41 Also, you're only allowed to criticize oil and gas companies if you heat your home with firewood.
5209 2018-02-07 14:52:38 oil isn't endless every one knows that but our effect on global warming isn't at all noticeable as the sea ice isn't melting or freezing at dramatic rates and in the 60 people used to worry about global cooling so just think about it also record cold temp been set last 20yrs
5210 2018-02-07 14:52:34 white ppl love to measure shit when they cook it's crazy. if that shit says a fkn tablespoon of oil are you really not able to just eyeball it??? y'all waste so much kitchen time just get some dam cooking instincts and throw in what looks right

But them again these people could make my car blow up on a set number of miles so...
5220 2018-02-07 14:51:50 Of course it is and should be. But it can’t be the only listing. Aramco would be too large a portion of Tadawul and could cause extreme volatility for Saudi economy if, say, price of oil suddenly shot up or crashed.
5221 2018-02-07 14:51:24 Because it is a good idea. Unless you want to be the first to completely swear off oil, and its derivatives like plastics.

5240 2018-02-07 14:49:05 Thanks Zoe! I've heard of rosehip oil before but never tried! Might give it a go
5241 2018-02-07 14:49:02 @BA777one Use 1 to 2 drops & run it for 30 to 60 minutes at a time.  I used 30 drops for 8 hours.  I was the only one not in a coma.  It was the funniest thing I've witnessed.  I didn't know an oil could have such sedative effects. Glad everyone is alive today!

5247 2018-02-07 14:48:32 I avoid using oil because oil don't  agree with my skin. It leave my lips even drier. But you can add a bit of coconut oil or olive oil. I suggest you try the non oil one first though, if that doesn't work then try with oil.

They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:

The Bible says that there are foolish Christians, and wise Christians.

Foolish ones find no need for growth, increase, abundance, replenishing, fruitfulness, vigilance, oil and LIGHT.

The Republicans don't care about people, animals or our environment. They have intensionally left Trump in power for one purpose and that's to force their agenda down our throats. Kill the need for oil and we will destroy the tyrants from the inside out.

5279 2018-02-07 14:44:52 It may or may not tell about where those companies think the price of oil is headed, each one has unique circumstance,  but its very interesting
5280 2018-02-07 14:44:44 You adopt their language and their terms ignoring the the heaps of evidence given for the GOP s dominant stake with oil and coal and bygone technologies with great fortunes clinging to their outdated modes and the racism and division sown for decades by the conservative right.

Yeah, that is kind of annoying. And unhelpful when we are trying to recover. #ableg

5339 2018-02-07 14:39:07 I would think if oil was flowing at higher amounts to tide water, these Alberta restaurants would see a positive impact. Albertans with no money spend no money at restaurants.

No income tax collected from people who work in the industry, no sales tax for people that work in oil fields. What would happen when all the income is gone? #TermLimits

5351 2018-02-07 14:37:43 At least you read all of the tweets. Calling it 'snake oil' is probably a bit strong as that suggests they are selling a lie. But as you say you can't really prove anything in psychology so any free thinking person can be sceptical of just about all of it if they wish.
5352 2018-02-07 14:37:39 The facts are there for all to see.Our economy witnessed some growth under Jonathan.Oil prices were lower than they were now b4 he left but things neva got dis bad.Corrupt his administration may be but dey weren't incompetent partly bcoz he surrounded himself wit d ryt ppl.

5354 2018-02-07 14:37:24 TM has past all of the Canadian governments regulatory environmental studies, so Why does B.C. have a problem. Do they want to shut off all oil going into their province or just Alberta oil.

5361 2018-02-07 14:36:26 Researchers say a chemical used to keep fry oil from bubbling over can do just that. Scientists at Japan's Yokohama University have found dimethylpolysiloxane can grow hair on bald mice and they think it could do the same on bald humans. #McDonald @McDonalds #baldnomore

5393 2018-02-07 14:33:04 He is a liar and con artist.  I think he ran for President so he would not have to pay taxes.  He is a snake oil salesman and a snake.  He is the one that does not respect the office of President.

5396 2018-02-07 14:33:00 How ironic that last night I was chanting "don't need no man" and then this morning I realize I need an oil change, my tire pressure is low, and I couldn't reach the top shelf to get something. 
5397 2018-02-07 14:32:57 @TheCurryGuy I know Ive teeeted you before about citric acid powder but have looked & still not sure can I leave it out of the chick pea pickle will it make much of a difference . Found mustard oil in my local spice shop

5410 2018-02-07 14:31:46 No.  We need to stop over producing and take other actions to reduce the usage of plastics and other oil based products.

5433 2018-02-07 14:30:00 Let me get up and get a oil change 
5434 2018-02-07 14:29:58 It’s not Oil. It’s Bitumen. Toxic, carcinogenic, unrecoverable in an ocean spill.  It’s also the lowest value petroleum product 1st to lose value as oil demand declines. Not in Canada’s interest, significant long term risk for all. #bcpoli @AJWVictoriaBC @jjhorgan @Wilkinson4BC

5446 2018-02-07 14:28:33 why do girls put off getting their oil changed

5458 2018-02-07 14:27:34 @realDonaldTrump The $53.1B Dec. trade deficit is the biggest monthly deficit since 2008. If you exclude oil, its the BIGGEST monthly deficit ever. In your 1st year in office America's huge trade deficit swelled by 12%. Instead of winning on trade, you are now losing big league!

5469 2018-02-07 14:27:03 Like the EPA wiping out consumer protections? Like wiping out bank regulations that protect consumers? FDA allowing pharma. companies to use the general public as test subjects? Regulations protecting public and federal lands from greedy corporations (OIL)? ETC., ETC., ETC.,
5470 2018-02-07 14:26:46 ですね…
5471 2018-02-07 14:26:40 DOES CASTOR OIL REALLY WORK FOR THE BROWS.,...?
5472 2018-02-07 14:26:34 Yes. I trust big oil companies to maximize profits just like every other business. Why else does anyone, even Granny with her candle store, go into business? Profits aren’t evil though govt does have a role to ensure reasonable limits to the pursuit of profit to protect citizens.

5474 2018-02-07 14:26:20 I think it is unfair that BC has a pipeline shipping wine into Alberta, but Alberta can't have a pipeline sending oil through BC. #Pipelines #BCWine
5475 2018-02-07 14:26:09 I’m going to start just straight dunking myself in tea tree oil until my body thinks it’s cute to stop breaking out.
5476 2018-02-07 14:25:47 Ermmm i would say yes. Sebab HL murah lagi. And in pump bottle. But then i belum try HL oil formulation baru
5477 2018-02-07 14:25:47 There's no oil there lmao 
5478 2018-02-07 14:25:43 This BC oil spat is a pretty interesting example of the resource curse imo: just bc we’ve got the resources doesn’t mean we need to or should exploit them.

Transitioning Canadian domestic energy production to non carbon energy is going to be full of hard decisions.

5508 2018-02-07 14:23:10 Watch some PBS oil painting shows. Might not be my style, but learned a few tricks. Gives you some confidence to try. Or maybe a good online YouTube ‘class.’ I’m also very heavy handed with a brush...fine detail escapes me right now. Need to figure that out.
5509 2018-02-07 14:23:01 Came to my dealership for my oil change n of course they tryna get me to get a new car lol “cmon you make too much to be driving this anymore” ...NOPE

5511 2018-02-07 14:22:57 It doesn’t contain SLS but does have SLES which is a very mild  & non irritating and helps the water the break down and disperse the oil during the washing process. You can try a patch test to check reaction b4 use . Hope this helps
5512 2018-02-07 14:22:55 Mismanagement is not the only reason behind a company collapsing. An economic meltdown or an abrupt change in govt policy can sink a firm. To answer your last question: ThreeWays would probably lose more money if the oil industry fails to pick up.

5557 2018-02-07 14:21:35 Cleaning up animals after an oil spill is feel good propaganda to make the public think they are helping. 90% of those animals will be dead within a few months. They've ingested enough of the oil that they are moving corpses.
5558 2018-02-07 14:21:34 I love sardines! Next time try squeezing lemon juice on top. Also try the bar harbor brand or the ones that costco sells that are boneless and skinless and I think packed in olive oil. They are pretty good.

5568 2018-02-07 14:20:03 Also oil paint... which makes being an art forger a bit of a bugger.
5569 2018-02-07 14:20:02 Haha! Try it with coconut oil, it’s so good. But you have to put it in the blender, otherwise it’s weird.
5570 2018-02-07 14:19:45 Accusing evo psych of "snake oil" is is basically accusing every single causal explanation in psychology of the same.
5571 2018-02-07 14:19:44 Look, I'm just excited SOMEONE is going to space, since our own government has decided it's not worth it compared to bombing brown people to take their oil
5572 2018-02-07 14:19:42 Sure, but this event is inspiring to many, and a lot better than pouring a couple hundred million in a soulless Holywood action flick, or, you know, oil, or weapons, or any of the many other things most rich people put their money in.
5573 2018-02-07 14:19:26 Let's pay the debts and refund on capital importation and see how much we have.debt is $62bn alone. Meanwhile the increase has nothing to do with governance or leadership, just oil price increase. @BBoason so we are not doing well

5580 2018-02-07 14:18:58 Why not eliminate both opioids and synthetic THC and use real cannabis. Full spectrum cannabis oil is significantly more beneficial than reductionist marinol. And if dosed correctly, you won’t miss the opioids.
5581 2018-02-07 14:18:54 Ok thought of something. I use baby oil for my skin recently (because I have a lot of skin problems and this helps) but thinking its only working because it sealing my skin. (Aka like a band-aid) This does nothing about reducing the appearance of scars caused by the skin problem.

5593 2018-02-07 14:16:46 7. Cameroon
Cameroon has compelling prospects to boost its industrial and agricultural output. The country stands out in the central Africa region because it is not as dependent on oil as some of its neighbours and therefore had less of a rocky time over the past two years-

5639 2018-02-07 14:12:00 I remain skeptical with the whole thing, Seems strange to focus always on shale builds given the ratio to conventional oil & given depletion rates as a whole vs capex in the industry. Conventional capex has much reduced, who invests with lower #oil ? given the long term nature

5868 2018-02-07 13:49:21 Yes. Which raises more questions than answers. e.g., $5MM a month on $5B in cash isn't exactly a great return, right? And it isn't like @SouthwestAir making money via its hedge on oil. That at least was related to the core business. This seems TOTALLY separate

5936 2018-02-07 13:42:26 Wait, just normal vaping stuff or like, oil? Cuz if they did a drug sweep over some kids swiping their parents' vaping gear that's a bit of an overreaction.

5938 2018-02-07 13:42:09 alguien segun jorgito debe estar impidiendo la firma del acuerdo y no piensa que posiblemente sea su contenido unilateral pero hay que culpar a alguien y el mas indicado es EEUU y no el G2 cubano.
5939 2018-02-07 13:42:06 I will not be surprised if WTI oil falls back to $60/bbl in the coming weeks, but I am curious to see market reaction when it gets there..

5948 2018-02-07 13:41:24 Yes it is. Usually just burning off oil after sitting for such a long time.
5949 2018-02-07 13:41:21 I think the oil business is own by multi national resource thieves and Alberta is too in bed with them to see what’s good for them. Oil is dead or we are dead so relax Alberta you’re in a dying industry. It won’t get easier for you.

5952 2018-02-07 13:41:10 US stock futures are down 0.4% with Europe higher and Asia mixed. Oil is $63.21 with gold at $1,327. The disruption seems to be waning with less daily volatility.  Today is likely to be a slightly down day.

5978 2018-02-07 13:37:10 Years ago I read about one of their Princes trying to build a green city in the desert.  Wonder if it's done?  Or if he completed it.  He said about a decade ago that their kingdom wouldn't be able to rely on oil much longer.

5981 2018-02-07 13:36:27 I doubt anyone outside of Alberta buys the whole ‘national interest’ bit. This pipeline is going to make the rich oil executives in Alberta even richer. The average Canadian is getting nothing.

5997 2018-02-07 13:34:19 @narendramodi Sir, Why we are not putting a ban on artificial ghee (vanaspati ghee) ,hydrogenated oil. 
It is affecting health badly, increasing high blood pressure ,diabetics patients every year.
5998 2018-02-07 13:34:02 Muchos vieron el lanzamiento de Musk con Space X ayer con admiración y maravilla, yo lo vi como un desdoble de poder de Big Tech, que sabemos que está en guerra con sus títeres los demócratas, contra el Military Industrial Complex y Big Oil.
5999 2018-02-07 13:33:51 Quebec here, thanks for all the Oil Sands money you have been sending us. We'd be screwed without it (we are fairly screwed with it).

6005 2018-02-07 13:33:16 You could start by imposing the Sanctions  but be careful not to slip on all that oil
6006 2018-02-07 13:33:12 How's your sun exposure? You could always add cod liver oil  :)
6007 2018-02-07 13:33:10 If you live in the northern climates of Canada, you would see that when it is -55 degrees out equipment, batteries, hydraulic hoses etc tend not to work very well. I dislike the government & 1% like you say but in reality we depend on oil for survival. At least for a bit longer.

6020 2018-02-07 13:31:15 Despite all the hype,you need not expect Trump's stance on Russia to change.  There are trillions of dollars in oil there that won't drill itself.
6021 2018-02-07 13:31:09 No US data today but we do get some crude oil inventory data later.. All eyes still on how US stocks perform
6022 2018-02-07 13:31:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, yet substantive conversation.

6027 2018-02-07 13:30:30 This is exactly the problem. We don’t act like a country anymore. Since when is it supposed to be one province against another? So you are telling me you would rather oil come from other countries than your own? If you care so much about the ocean why dump raw sewage into it?
6028 2018-02-07 13:30:25 As opposed to what industry? Oil? Banking? Pharm? Tobacco?
THOSE are the sleazebags.
6029 2018-02-07 13:30:24 #WellnessWednesday Do you have difficulty sleeping? Have you considered aromatherapy? The scent of lavender is known to relax the body and induce sleep. Stop in to pick up an essential oil and perhaps a diffuser today!

6039 2018-02-07 13:29:08 It won’t be wasted. We need to get our product out of the ground & to market. The less we depend on foreign oil, the more money we would then have to put towards green energy. And in the meantime create & keep more jobs.

It is affecting health badly, increasing high blood pressure ,diabetics patients every year.
6046 2018-02-07 13:28:08 This is such a hilarious contrast to Mom, who completely ignored my crazed texts and immediately launched into Bachelor updates.
6047 2018-02-07 13:27:56 Ahahahaahaha ada2. Btw kau paai oil cleanser apa?
6048 2018-02-07 13:27:55 Still we have so many things that we'll do to sustain ourselves if it's divided,i believe some will still relocate back to north if such happens they only brag about 'OIL' nothing else after that.
6049 2018-02-07 13:27:45 So much better. I used tamanu oil on my face and since then my face has cleared up

6051 2018-02-07 13:26:57 another key thing to rem is that t&t took a unique approach to post-independence dev. we're one of the few oil + gas nations who actually pull a percent from drilling + exploration. t&t was huge on sovereignty and not selling our land + resources to foreign powers.
6052 2018-02-07 13:26:54 We don’t want oil offshore drilling or fracking on shore
6053 2018-02-07 13:26:50 Seriously. I get that oil is important, and jobs are becoming scarce and all. However, explain the logic here please.  #BCWine
6054 2018-02-07 13:26:48 Nah, Big Oil will be alive and well in the USA while the rest of the world goes solar and wind.
6055 2018-02-07 13:26:45 Paychecks are going up because the GOP ARTIFICIALLY LOWERED THE WITHHOLDING TABLES INCREASING NET WAGES... but when tax day comes on 4/15/2019 - they'll discovered that CarpetBaggers and Snake oil salesman aren't just in the History books!
6056 2018-02-07 13:26:25 I know it doesn’t change anything, but just to maybe ease you mind, this isn’t remotely true. 

Nuclear winter models were first developed in the early 80s but they were complelty thrown out after the first gulf war. Saddam lighting the oil wells gave a good small scale

Actually, not a terrible idea...
6213 2018-02-07 13:03:27 まず、アイスのコーティング部分をやさしく舐めまわしましたよねー、基本形ｗ
6214 2018-02-07 13:03:24 #JohnHorgan #RachaelNotley #JustinTrudeau   Why are you allowing this to happen,quit fighting over the oil shipments it’s a done deal. Hurting other industries is not helping the working people out either. If the prime minister would do his job and stand up for his country.
6215 2018-02-07 13:03:10 E be like say you don see work for oil company

6217 2018-02-07 13:03:01 History sadly shows that Sweden eventually will give up, I guess! Otherwise, it might harm business interests in China. Norway has oil and still gave up!
6218 2018-02-07 13:03:00 You cat talk slick to a can of oil nigga.
6219 2018-02-07 13:02:58 Oil & gas drilling aren't a good deal for Ireland: offer no guarantee of local jobs, no guaranteed supply to the Irish market, and poor financial benefit for the State. Don't issue anymore licences, support  the #ClimateEmergency Bill @campaignforleo #FossilFreeFuture

6230 2018-02-07 13:01:44 Alright then, I assume you’re the authority to tell people what they NEED and what they just WANT?  Cars to work and bicycles to the grocery store? Just don’t oil the chains. No more power boats for fishing indistry? Need cell phones or just want them?
6231 2018-02-07 13:01:22 はい
6232 2018-02-07 13:01:20 Fossil fuel employs so many more than solar it's not even close. In the Northeast you can't hardly spit without hitting an oil delivery company, a heat / ac contractor, etc...which are all fossil fuel driven jobs. But solar is a 10th of that.
6233 2018-02-07 13:01:18 Time for a serious discussion of the Canadian Federation... deeper than wine and oil....it is not going to get better on its own, Canada. Leader doing "people" syllable jokes.  Has globalism now eroded our very indentiy?  Disturbing, but needs a good airing to dry out the mould.
6234 2018-02-07 13:01:17 Watching for that breakdown today, oil also looking like butt
6235 2018-02-07 13:01:14 I don’t use lotion, I use oil gel. 
6236 2018-02-07 13:01:12 You’ll learn to hate them eventually. Just like every other team that competes against the Oil. Lol
6237 2018-02-07 13:01:03 Thank you, oil!

6240 2018-02-07 13:00:51 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever. -Psalm 23: 5-6
6241 2018-02-07 13:00:42 Good. :) That means you chose the right profession for you, and that's a very, very cool feeling.
6242 2018-02-07 13:00:39 Me neither! But I heard pakoda sellers will be given air fryers, so oil won’t be an issue 
6243 2018-02-07 13:00:30 あるといいな（大学も似たような比率らしい

6245 2018-02-07 13:00:17 Oil companies in Canada formed an innovation network called @COSIA_ca. It under-performs. More innovation and far more impact if public funders threw in $$, helped govern, and mandated #openscience principles. @ISED_CA @NSERC_CRSNG

6249 2018-02-07 13:00:01 In Saudi Arabia, if an oil field is found in your garden you must report it to the state before digging a bore hole greater than 5000 feet.
6250 2018-02-07 13:00:01 fuck oil
6251 2018-02-07 13:00:00 For dry skin, you need Moisturising Rooibos Shea, Argan Oil(use as your daily facial moisturizer accompanied by SPF,at all times),Soothing Avocado Overnight Serum(use daily at night at night after cleansing). Thank you.
6252 2018-02-07 12:59:55 The solar number is totally inflated. It counts installers whereas fossil fuel jobs don't count contractors who do installations / furnace maintenance / oil deliveries or any of that stuff. It's a joke how ridiculously distorted the numbers are.
6253 2018-02-07 12:59:53 I would give them oars not oil.

Have you become overconfident of your performance??
6256 2018-02-07 12:59:42 If we're smart we keep the estimated 50 trillion barrels (50 years worth) discovered in North Dakota untapped until the middle East oil starts to dry up. Then WE have of control of the global oil market.
6257 2018-02-07 12:59:38 Bc isn't a petrostate though. Other than being the mule so to speak, I don't think they get any of the oil money. Upfront jobs and possibly high port fees?
6258 2018-02-07 12:59:33 Well are you for or againtst Alberta oil??????? Dumb bc now wine banned - good! Would like to see a wall net and gas cut off to Bc, no more heat or gas!

6276 2018-02-07 12:57:01 Vladimir Putin has zero to gain by having Trump as president actually having Trump as president is ruining the power through fossil fuel that Russia had over Europe because now we're exporting natural gas coal and oil to Europe.

6278 2018-02-07 12:56:49 It's a damning indictment of an industry that a company that regularly claims to have lower production costs than Saudi Arabia or the largest oil discovery or whatever else it can do by manipulating accounting numbers or relying on non-GAAP bs is one of the less bad ones.
6279 2018-02-07 12:56:40 Not just oil and gas, how's about the entire dirty energy sector, renewables, transport, health, housing......
6280 2018-02-07 12:56:40 Mokeski could score 10 points, grab 8 boards and then change the oil in your car while cooking brats after the game wearing a jump suit with his name on it...#myhero
6281 2018-02-07 12:56:34 They and their fake fraudulent propaganda.  When you find energy that cost next to nothing why stop it? Greed from oil  It certainly isn’t for the good of the people or earth

6297 2018-02-07 12:53:40 Concerned people contacted me and assured the availability of 2t oil pouches as soon as possible. As the 2t oil is available ill inform you.
6298 2018-02-07 12:53:17 Are you sure they mismanaged the company? ThreeWays had stellar growth before Uganda's oil industry ground to a halt. In light of the ongoing calls for local content, ThreeWays would have easily recovered if it had been bailed out.

6301 2018-02-07 12:52:36 Im curious Mr. Anderson, wouldnt it make more sense to stop importing oil from dictatorships over seas and keep our oil in use here in North America. Both logically and economically. Why are we importing, turning around and exporting?
6302 2018-02-07 12:52:33 No way do I believe he's not full of inner rage serving desperate cheeto & watching his party cover for #CadetBoneSpur.

6311 2018-02-07 12:51:08 Thank you for writing to us. Post deregulation, oil marketing companies set the Retail Outlet wise rates, which depends on various factors, including logistic cost of transporting the product to the said retail outlet, among other factors.
6312 2018-02-07 12:51:02 He did it again.  Now everyone's talking about a parade instead of russia, money laundering,  the nra, immigration,  oil drilling on park land, Flint, etc....
6313 2018-02-07 12:51:01 THAT is what made her confront him - a govt shutdown?  Not sexual assault, Russian collusion, selling our economy to corporate CEOs, obstruction of justice, supporting white supremacy, gutting State, giving our coastline to oil, golfing vacations, the wall...really now!

6325 2018-02-07 12:49:44 This is the effect of not one but two NDP governments that are at odds. Delay signing of exporting oil to BC just a week or 2 and see the real impact similarly what conservatives did back with Ontario.

6329 2018-02-07 12:48:53 I think London's output is nearer £70Billion, GERS and other historic data has shown that every penny of oil revenue attributed to Scotland has been and continues to be returned to it. AND we get ca. £1700 per capita on top of that. So what the hell are they whining about now?

6335 2018-02-07 12:47:55 A perfect metaphor for the snake oil he is selling to America. The march to authoritarianism is masked with the promise of restoring the nation and its people to a past glory that has not even been defined but for which we mindlessly long.

6342 2018-02-07 12:46:02 Perhaps if B.C doesn't want Albertan oil, they should get their oil from Venezuela instead (because that country is doing marvelous right now!). If you want federal transfer payments, you need tax dollars. A higher price for our Canadian oil pays for social programs. #bcwine

6346 2018-02-07 12:45:03 Minister of State for Internal Affairs ObigaKania has declined to give a statement on the alleged illegal transportation of crude oil from the albertine region.
Dokolo Woman MP Cecilia Ogwal last week expressed fear that the country's oil resource might already be facing plunder.

6354 2018-02-07 12:43:25 The existing variations of Universal Basic Income are either not universal or do not offer basic income. Those that are both universal and offer a minimum living income are not funded by taxes, but rents like oil wealth.
6355 2018-02-07 12:43:05 Very high probability that crude oil has topped out at 70-72 out for 2018. Might crash fast to 55-58. Given shale oil supply coming fast & extreme winters in US are coming to an end. Oil producers might panic anytime and short futures big time.

6482 2018-02-07 12:24:51 forecasting the oil and non-oil balance separately is standard to most models.  non-oil maps to the lagged dollar well.   oil, well, used to me modeled as inelastic imports + price and now US production and net imports are a function of price. split matters!

6493 2018-02-07 12:23:30 Really? Why are they saving it? Fuck no man, we need spending to keep the economy vibrant. Oil jobs pay. Oil workers spend money and they spend money on luxury goods. We want those jobs. Like I said, cut out profiteers and safety is all I want.
6494 2018-02-07 12:23:06 Nigeria has the highest rate of crude oil theft in the world.

6497 2018-02-07 12:22:50 What powers those ships that go into the port that help makes the city? All that port industry and jobs? All the potential for added jobs.

FYI adding refineries does not make financial sense at this point because of the processing req. for the type of oil.

6503 2018-02-07 12:22:04 The biggest hit on ThreeWays came as a result of the slowdown in the oil industry. ThreeWays called for a govt oil fund where distressed firms would get cheap credit.
6504 2018-02-07 12:21:50 Truly ironic statement I think. Worked up north in oil sands. What study. Guess what they have the info you may want. it has been leaking into the river since oil was formed  in the ground.
6505 2018-02-07 12:21:32 Remember the subsidies are going to oil and gas (net and by a wide margin) not renewables. And grids will be fine and evolve, don’t worry. But you can worry if you prefer - just don’t spout random stuff (please)

6522 2018-02-07 12:19:14 Some adversity? Bit of an understatement they've had their entire economy sabotaged for over a decade. They are an oil dependant economy with very little else to make money with. There are plenty of other examples where socialism was working until Capitalist powers intervene

6526 2018-02-07 12:18:39 Venezuela has 'imploded' because the government there put in constitution the 'right to house' for all.

Turns out that government of even an oil rich nation cannot build houses for all the houseless on its streets without 'imploding' the national economy.

6543 2018-02-07 12:15:57 If I wait a day, will I hear you making the opposite argument that we should have been saving our oil revenue like Norway instead of lowering Alberta taxes? That one’s more popular in places like BC that want to arrange things for us.
6544 2018-02-07 12:15:40 I've never ever had the pleasure of trying coconut oil!  to try!
6545 2018-02-07 12:15:38 I got it for 3,500/- I was using Neutrogena before the grapefruit oil free for acne and it was really nice @ 1,800 but I couldn’t find it

6552 2018-02-07 12:14:41 And then of course the nonsense in New Hampshire where New England has been blocked by “environmental” groups from importing hydro energy, or from building nuclear, so we burn more gas and oil instead. Brilliant!

6559 2018-02-07 12:13:05 If Nifty crosses 10550-600 then more strength will follow. If WTI Crude oil breaks 60-62 then banks can rally fast. Nothing is certain in this world. Keep working on high probabilistic scenarios and manage risk carefully.

6561 2018-02-07 12:12:50 BC forest products reduce natural carbon capture. Ontario and Quebec urban sprawl reduce carbon capture. Theses activities do not effect foreign interests, hence no money to Canada’s eco-terrorists to oppose them. Oil from Canada produces dollars in Canada not foreign countries.

6573 2018-02-07 12:10:21 'Since 2014, Venezuela has been suffering from a deep economic crisis brought about by the drop in global oil prices, a dysfunctional exchange rate system, and a decrease in oil production levels.'
6574 2018-02-07 12:10:20 It will not happen. What goes up goes down also. See Bitcoin and oil price. To much speculation. Till end of this year DOW will reach 30.000 points.

6577 2018-02-07 12:10:01 Coconut oil, a super food that's not all good for your health — Quartz
6578 2018-02-07 12:09:56 You truly have no idea how money works. If oil is selling at $50, but it costs $65 to produce unsubsidized, then there is no oil. And therefore no “social cost of carbon” tax revenues. And then what? How do the renewables get built? They don’t. Transport, et al halts.
6579 2018-02-07 12:09:16 I mean, I’m pretty certain snake oil probably has kairomones in it.

6590 2018-02-07 12:07:07 If it's the businesses then it's the oil producing nations, the petroleum refineries, the bottling companies, the distribution system, the retail chains and then the consumer.
6591 2018-02-07 12:06:50 Oh okay. I suggest you wash your hair with a clarifying shampoo and then use coconut oil hair mask if you’ve got that or any essential oil hair mask. You’re welcome babe

6603 2018-02-07 12:05:07 Jet fuel, gasoline, diesel, plastic, beef, thermal electricity, consumption all contributed to CO2 emissions. Reducing human impact on the planet is required to effect CO2 generation. Oil from Canada left in the ground does not reduce CO2. Foreign governments understand this.

6630 2018-02-07 12:02:22 I haven’t cried - yet... She started to leak coolant so I just kept topping her up. Then this morning basically ALL of the coolant was on the road. As well as all of my oil. So her sump is ruined too 
6631 2018-02-07 12:02:05 Have you noticed the debt ceiling! Have you read what deductions we will lose? On the end , we will all pay MORE taxes and lose benefits while the oil cos and billionaires reap $&
6632 2018-02-07 12:01:59 guess all that raw sewage from Vancouver island going into the ocean for decades  makes  your coastline perfect . I wonder if that is good for the environment. It’s actually pretty sad.  There is so many greedy bc people that work in the oil industry in Alberta .
6633 2018-02-07 12:01:41 I believe that’s what “made some fried chicken” meant but if you mean did I create the chicken? Well, no. Nor did source the oil, or mill the flour.

6651 2018-02-07 11:59:49 On the snowy roads today, @BNN 'Morning Call' returns tomorrow. Interesting #Trudeau seeks to speed up passage of #marijuana bill but takes NO action on #oil #pipeline - that a sign of his "economic strategy" ?
6652 2018-02-07 11:59:35 I know I sound like a trumper but I'm actually just interested in truth & no more imperialist wars for profit and oil..the whole world gets dragged in & must stoop to the USA'S extraordinary hypocrisy.  youve heard of mcarthy trials right? this has to stop. where is the evidence?
6653 2018-02-07 11:59:30 On a separate note . Have u noticed even king of motivation Antony Robbins has become a financial advisor instead of motivational guru .. guess that’s the new frontier of the snake oil salespeople
6654 2018-02-07 11:59:19 I hear he also has pretty cheap snake oil?
6655 2018-02-07 11:59:16 You decide whether to fornicate and a wilful partner to fornicate with.

6662 2018-02-07 11:58:17 It takes a bit of time to find the right products for your skin! I have combo skin too so I have different moisturisers and Primers for certain areas of my face :) emulsions are a lighter weight moisturiser so they’re great for oil prone parts and creams are better for dry parts
6663 2018-02-07 11:57:31 That's why your skin is so flawless 
Do you have recommendations for oil cleanser, toner, emulsion and exfoliator?

6670 2018-02-07 11:56:19 I have a classic 10-step routine: 
Oil cleanse, foaming cleanse, toner, serum/ampoule, eye cream, lip serum, cream and emulsion every day then exfoliate once a week, sheet masks 2-3 times a week as well as a ocassionally micro needling and peeling masks :)

6672 2018-02-07 11:55:12 You mean like silver, or more like gold? Oil? LIBOR? Or perhaps more traditionally just like the yen, euro, or USD?

6684 2018-02-07 11:53:12 The main thing is if you’re oil prone at all is to make sure you’re skins getting enough hydration! If you skimp to try and compensate, your skin will naturally produce more serum to protect itself :)

I suppose I could've explained "Extra Virgin Olive Oil," but I'm mean.

Leave out the egg and it is flakier (use oil instead of butter), but vegan.

6748 2018-02-07 11:39:34 Worthless in the sense that if I give you a barrel of oil what are you gonna do with it? Unless you have the capability to turn it into something useful. If I give you a barrel of gasoline you know exactly what to do with it.

I have to admit, the market wanted to see the company put their money where their mouth is. 100,000 barrels of oil from just two oil wells in two months and now the PATTENTED DTU tech has been proven (400%+)

7017 2018-02-07 10:46:57 Your economic logic doesn’t hold together. If $50 per bbl isn’t enough to produce oil profitably, then guess what, it doesn’t come out of the ground. Wells shut down, crude producers go out of business and you set off a decade long energy crisis. Subsidies smooth the biz cycle.
7018 2018-02-07 10:46:50 That is an accurate portrayal of the squalor in Haiti. I have seen as bad in areas in a few other places in the world but 90% of Haiti is just like that.

7045 2018-02-07 10:40:34 Just because you're bought by big oil and don't mind turning your Province into an environmental disaster does not mean we in BC have to do the same. Tourism is our economy, it's our jobs . Keep fracking away in Alberta and we might not have a planet for you to start a trade war.
7046 2018-02-07 10:40:12 I've literally just shown you the break-down. Where's the oil generating electricity? Show me.

7048 2018-02-07 10:40:02 I actually stayed at that resort in Haiti. It is very nice but believe this, have also toured around the Island - to say it is a $hithole is giving it undo credit.
Drilled oil wells all over the world for 40 years. Been to a few real $hithole places, Warri Nigeria, Luanda Angola
7049 2018-02-07 10:40:02 Like oil which we subsidize costing us billions every year? Or how the government controls the price of coal?

7051 2018-02-07 10:39:42 So I go to the dentist again, after he fixed 3 teeth. All of the sudden he tells me I have 4 other teeth with cavities. He starts drilling as if he’s prospecting for oil in my mouth. Then he makes me pay JPY75,000. Dude my mouth is not an oil well. #Dentist

7155 2018-02-07 10:14:10 Factors to impact #Inflation
1) International crude oil prices have firmed up since Aug’17, driven by both demand supply-side factors.
2) Non-oil industrial raw material prices have also witnessed a global uptick. Firms polled in the #RBIs IOS expect input prices to harden in Q4.
7156 2018-02-07 10:13:56 Much is cunningly hidden behind the polarization & systematic recurrent bigotry hate acts :
1. Taxes at global high level. Who will think up & implement a 28% GST! 
2. Who will shrewdly implement huge Fuel prices when global oil prices are at abysmal low!

7168 2018-02-07 10:11:38 Well said! Best way of expressing this; What happens when you leave a bottle of olive oil out at room temperature? Nothing. Same with margarine? It goes rancid and smells - it's oxidising. Guess what happens if you put it in your 35c/97f body?

7173 2018-02-07 10:10:48 Great effort, but how is this compatible with the continuous and expanded oil drilling activities by state-owned oil companies? Norway prides itself for zero emission vehicles, while at the same time reaping profits from fuel consumption in vehicles in the rest of the world.

7247 2018-02-07 09:57:11 And then again, what a massive disruption to the economy if that oil and gas doesn’t get produced. How will we deploy renewables if there isn’t any diesel to deliver the parts? It’s as if discourse has reverted to 4th grade. All whining, no thought.
7248 2018-02-07 09:56:38 @ONPWA why is #Australia not getting the same royalties from the #oil and #gas as the same as #Qatar or other middle eastern countries

He succeeded but with the decline in oil prices, other US economic rivals like China became powerful.

7261 2018-02-07 09:54:44 The right word is not 'until we are able' but 'until we are allowed' to refine oil locally. We have hundreds of Nigerians that can refine petroleum locally but the 'Govt.' won't let them.
7262 2018-02-07 09:54:34 Chavez was doing great until the world stopped caring as much about oil and Venezuala's bank ran dry and all their housing programs died But you're right, he then preceeded to destroy everything and now he's successor is turning it into a fucking dictatorship.

7264 2018-02-07 09:53:55 Call it the natural Law of supply & demand situation as this dictates the price of a commodity. Does this mean now that aside from recent oil price hikes experienced, we will also expect another high price increase on RICE? OMG !! Kaya maraming mahihirap kumakapit na sa patlim!

7599 2018-02-07 08:56:52 I think everyone is encouraging AB to shut down oil exports, especially via TMX. If they do that for a month, the pipeline debate will be resolved.  But I doubt very much that AB will be the winner.  Oil is an easily substitutable commodity.
7600 2018-02-07 08:56:48 It is 'snake oil' after all. It is annoying to see treasury forecasts rubbished by Mogg and his ilk, when they have absolutely nothing tangible to offer at all. They are scared to reveal the truth.
7601 2018-02-07 08:56:27 . @UKenyatta my advise is that you go FULL THROTTLE on your dictatorship since you are supported by the United States of America (because of the oil). But one day the darlingship will end; it will end badly. CC: @WilliamsRuto @realDonaldTrump @BobGodec #MigunaDeported
7602 2018-02-07 08:56:21 What if oil never was discovered. 

I'm not saying it is the one discovery I would remove from history to reduce wars, climate change and plastic pollution (list goes on). Not at all.

7613 2018-02-07 08:54:22 From the article it says monthly bank repayments and maintenance = £5.5k yet the current tariff generated £6k.
Fuel costs are similar to gas and cheaper than oil.
On original tariff he was benefiting from £11.5k+ per month profit on #RHI since installation to changes

You're a genius at what you do, honestly the best there'll ever be.

7685 2018-02-07 08:38:36 Same with oil. Why does Exxon have the exclusive rights to OUR oil and the profits of its sale? You agree it belongs to us, right? American citizens. Why not socialize it? All revenue would then fund public works or shares by the American people. It’s not a “free market.”
7686 2018-02-07 08:38:33 Edible oil market in India grew by 25.6% in 2017 to cross Rs 1.3 trillion (US$ 20.23 billion), according to Euromonitor International.
Growth is primarily coming from new consumers, who are shifting from loose to packaged oils.

7727 2018-02-07 08:31:00 Approved by a problematic and discredited process, that Trudeau acknowledged as such back in 2015. The review was insufficient and incomplete, except for the oil industry which needed it to be that way. We were promised a full, proper, unbiased review — we never received it.

7892 2018-02-07 07:57:22 It's only because of declining gas reserves in Pakistan and limited exploration activity due to unattractive petroleum policy to Oil & Gas Companies. Importantly, Thanks to Musharraf who allowed CNG stations to deprives us of abundant Gas reserves.

7911 2018-02-07 07:51:29 I cant make jokes about this.  Especially as people are starving to death down there.  It's such a beautiful country with the biggest oil reserves in the world.  This is a testament of how an ideology can reap hell on earth.

7932 2018-02-07 07:46:18 that's why we shouldn't drill for oil and should divers from fossil fuels completely.

7999 2018-02-07 07:32:26 Wouldn't it be better just to try and work together to determine a mutually acceptable solution using a consensus model....oil from Alberta needs to be shipped somehow in order to benefit Canadians, and BC needs Alberta's market for its goods.  Time to sit down and talk!

8130 2018-02-07 07:10:09 Nothing is going to happen by next week. No pipelines, no oil boycotts, BC's wine industry won't die off in a week either.

Don't be absurd. This conversation is ridiculous. Alberta has too many ignorant people who are stuck in the past.

He made me feel better by saying someone yesterday didn't know their engine needed oil lol.

8171 2018-02-07 07:07:37 Then BC can move to renewables, and use existing oil resources for airlines.

Still easier than Alberta getting their oil to the coast without going through BC.

8183 2018-02-07 07:05:12 The founding fathers also only bathed once a month because they believed people needed to build up thick layers of dirt and oil on their skin to keep germs off,&so families shared bathtubs to share their oil water with eachother,&they bathed the babies last so they got the most

8187 2018-02-07 07:04:48 It's certainly clever, and better than nothing. I'm increasingly convinced we're plastic (or rather oil) addicts, trying to work out how we can keep using it, like a late stage alcoholic promising to cut down a bit.
8188 2018-02-07 07:04:46 Try reducing dairy intake and using coconut oil on the really dry patches. I'm sure you know this too but use less face products. I used to have the worst eczema :( hope it gets better

8192 2018-02-07 07:04:21 Can't wait. Also, the crooked deal he struck with Kabila through his nephew Khulubuse must be scratched. Imagine Zuma and Khulubuse exploiting oil blocks worth $10 billion in DRC

8203 2018-02-07 07:02:37 See I'm not anti pipeline I'm anti federal government 

It's a really tough issue in terms of my beliefs but I think the Feds need to step out of this and BC and Alberta need to sign a proper treaty on oil pipelines now and future

8210 2018-02-07 07:01:37 Albertans better smarten up.. Stop alienating themselves from other provinces, and start focusing on non oil related businesses. Support what they have, and start focusing, on the development of renewable resources.. Oil won't be around forever!
8211 2018-02-07 07:01:04 I understand it's very easy to get blinkered by regional interests in all of this. But I live on the Coast. I don't want oil tankers destroying coastal habitat, finishing off endangered populations of orcas.

8215 2018-02-07 07:00:10 What a joke. Obama tried shutting down all he could by declaring oil/coal lands off-limits. Trouble is, he couldn't control ALL those areas, and the world price being high, many fields were developed DESPITE his efforts to the contrary.  Obama had ZERO to do with the oil boom.
8216 2018-02-07 07:00:08 Don't you have a $100 pair of boxers?
8217 2018-02-07 07:00:00 Well, here’s your problem. We own the oil and royalties from it go directly to our treasury.
8218 2018-02-07 06:59:44 we have oil. what do you expect?
8219 2018-02-07 06:59:08 57% of American have less than $1000 in savings, 39% have none at all... This isn’t Dubai.  People are struggling and this government took care of their donors, not regular Americans who slog day, in day out...Trump is a snake oil salesman and con man...

8221 2018-02-07 06:58:42 It's a lot easier for BC to find new oil/bitumen providers than for Alberta to find a way to transport their oil to the coast (to ship overseas).
8222 2018-02-07 06:58:34 This is going to sound so dumb but i did not expect fish oil to smell so fucking terrible.
8223 2018-02-07 06:58:06 Shouldn't conservatives be concerned that the Pentagon "lost track of" $800M recently and that a deep audit of defense spending is way overdue? Make allocation conditional on an audit. DOD, you work for me.

8227 2018-02-07 06:57:29 I vividly remember the scene in the episode where Frasier changes his carpet and accidentally loses Martin's chair off the balcony. Martin later spills oil on the new carpet.

8232 2018-02-07 06:56:48 It’s the perfect solution. Re-introduce the NEP. Force BC to allow oil pipeline and force Alberta to sell oil to BC refineries at a price that permits $0.45/litre gasoline.
8233 2018-02-07 06:56:44 Like building electric cars and reducing the dependence on oil, building huge batteries for Australia's power shortage, and advancing solar energy technology to curb climate change? Those sort of problems? ;)

8236 2018-02-07 06:55:01 Norway’s oil company is nationalized, so the profits directly benefit the state. Kinder Morgan is a private corporation based out of Texas, so have very little interest in our country or our provinces outside of how much money they can make for themselves
8237 2018-02-07 06:54:59 Again Ms. Notley, I wish you the best in the next election but MY government is reflecting - acting on the concerns & hesitations of my family, the majority of our friends & neighbours, & myself by demanding more in depth study to ensure our lands & oceans stay clean of your oil.
8238 2018-02-07 06:54:54 It'll run better once u do, but far far worse if it runs out of oil...

8242 2018-02-07 06:54:10 I just want to have some fucking breakfast after a night from hell but nope. No clean dishes, no olive oil so my eggs stuck to the pan, no cereal. Guess I'm just not eating today.

8246 2018-02-07 06:51:31 It actually is oil sands but that’s not what Albertan’s called it at first.
8247 2018-02-07 06:51:23 Yey mine felt like it was just dropped in oil

8249 2018-02-07 06:51:06 I wonder if I could write a fable about a Big Oil industry holed up in concrete cities that picked on a loving little wine industry in a pretty agricultural valley. The oil folks drive their big trucks towing their gas guzzling boats to the little valley to play..Hmmm @jjhorgan
8250 2018-02-07 06:50:48 Yeah. And they should be executed. China(or better say Chinese buisness ppl) are importing weapons and oil

8254 2018-02-07 06:50:04 @NTAGMN Pls Let Government Use The Money They Generate From Oil N Other Resources Well,Then There Wont Be Need To Beg Nigerians To Pay Tax.
8255 2018-02-07 06:49:34 IT'S A TRAP!!! THEY NEED OIL TO PREPARE RECIPES FROM THEIR BOOK, "TO SERVE MAN," MANNN.
8256 2018-02-07 06:49:33 Realistically, ppl are guna keep burning oil until we run out. So maybe we should just burn it all up quickly so we can move on to better things. Get out there and idle those F350s!

8263 2018-02-07 06:48:23 I grew up in Calgary & i can remember how excited i was when Notley won. But she got scared after the oil-price downturn & her concern for working folks turned into a concern for preserving the oil&gas industry at all costs.  

In the words of the guy down south: Sad!

8265 2018-02-07 06:48:07 I honestly think this is it. I’m trying to cook with a bit of olive oil and mam would have just a hunk of lard!

8269 2018-02-07 06:47:17 "I fought for Muslims in Iraq" says Molan. Dangerous to have the Australian Army on your side when Molan is in charge. (Unless he meant the Muslims who are shareholders in munitions companies, oil companies and in the Israeli government)

8277 2018-02-07 06:45:25 I love how big oil has managed to distill the argument into BC vs AB. I don’t have a problem with resource extraction or industry. It’s the sneaky shit these Corps do that harms us all and they never pay.

8283 2018-02-07 06:44:47 But not because there are sanctions preventing them from the oil deliveries, convenient they need that much oil to ship their small tam of athletes across a border

8330 2018-02-07 06:38:45 Canada is a federation. BC, like all provinces, has powers, including over property and civil rights in the Province. We don't appreciate being lectured about what we need to be "reminded of" about the "national interest" by folks who won't be directly affected by oil spills.

8338 2018-02-07 06:37:30 @acoyne refers to "unreasoned environmental fears." He also refers to the pipeline carrying crude oil across BC. He is wrong on both counts. The environmental fears are based on a history of oil spills on both land & sea, and dilbit is not crude oil.

8345 2018-02-07 06:36:34 What a complete moron you are. SPILL oil? I'd love to see your afford healthcare without the tax revenue from a vital Canadian industry. But I'm again guessing, like the rest of your pseudo-environmentalists, is that you'll vilify an industry while consuming its products.
8346 2018-02-07 06:36:27 @NTAGMN It’s great that FGN through the Ministry of Finance is going on the offensive to deal with tax evasion and tax avoidance. Time to see tax as a valuable source of income as oil.

8389 2018-02-07 06:26:04 Does it help? You could give this a go: shatavari plus. There’s a place called Maitri healthcare in London that does it. They deliver. It helped me But obviously we’ve got diff issues. I also apply a geranium Ess. oil diluted in a carrier oil 25 drops to 100 mls.

8408 2018-02-07 06:22:58 the ndp was never against the pipeline. that narrative was born out of the oppositions need to paint the ndp as "anti oil and gas". what chance would any government have in alberta if they were opposed to O&G? they just have a different approach.

8427 2018-02-07 06:18:59 This seems to be turning into a pissing match. We block wine, they block beef. And it goes on & on. Since 80% of the lower mainland fuel comes via the KM line. How about we cut the flow by 1/3, push gas prices up. BC doesn't want our oil. Let's give them a taste or $2/ltr gas.

8429 2018-02-07 06:18:47 So does mine (Green Bean casserole). I have yet to make CoM from scratch but it's likely sautee chopped onion and mushrooms in butter and oil, add flour cook roux, add cream/milk, chicken stock, salt pepper to taste. Not hard but not as easy as open a can. And it's not condensed.

8464 2018-02-07 06:12:53 Honestly do your research the airport in Vancouver etc is getting oil refined in Washington. It's piped there to be refined and naturally some sold internationally. The existing infrastructure isn't where we should be by now. Compromise would be upgraded then exported.

8473 2018-02-07 06:11:17 and I absolutely get that argument! as a proud West Coaster, I don't want that amazing way of life ruined due to an oil spill in a place where millions of people reside. There needs to be comprehensive discussion and compromises made. Canada's economy relies on it!

8493 2018-02-07 06:07:48 I’m reminded of a story: in the late 80’s, Operation Prime Chance established mobile sea bases on oil rig repair barges in the Gulf. For surface defense two Vulcan cannons from the 82nd ABN were mounted on each barge. 1/x

8499 2018-02-07 06:06:34 My boyfriend and I both work in oil and gas. Pipelines are still a hard issue for me. I agree with their necessity but I think caution is in order. BC stands to put so much at risk w/o much economic benefit
8500 2018-02-07 06:06:25 The comment is in reference to Pierre Trudeau’s National Energy Program which had mandated Alberta sell their oil to the rest of Canada for far below market value. Alberta screamed blue bloody murder that the federal govt dictated to the Province about their jurisdiction.
8501 2018-02-07 06:06:19 The fact of the matter is that oil is still a large part of the economy, and will be until a transition to green energy is made. The provinces need to work together, not play blame games and fight like children.

8503 2018-02-07 06:06:04 It probably had something to do with oil.
8504 2018-02-07 06:05:43 Really~ Perhaps you should refresh your memory on the #ExxonValdez oil spill & dumped 11 Million gallons of crude oil into #Alaska Prince William sound killing everything in site. Tankers transport in BC coastal waters~ leak, spill & foreign registered to avoid lawsuits.
8505 2018-02-07 06:05:37 Yes, overall oil is bad, and even though it doesn't get much headlines, A LOT of oil & gas companies are HEAVILY investing in green tech like Solar & Wind. Oil dependancy will not disappear overnight! There needs to be a transition. Pipelines are a present day reality!
8506 2018-02-07 06:05:37 Does Cannabis Oil decrease dementia and memory related illnesses?
8507 2018-02-07 06:05:33 Bringing Alberta's economy into the conversation in a time of hardship is a pretty low blow. Besides , that 'dirty tarsands oil' very well created the petroleum by-products needed to manufacture the mobile device you're tweeting from ! Stop being so small minded and show respect
8508 2018-02-07 06:05:26 The "GMO" effect or "Get Me Out" effect saw massive selloffs in global stocks since Friday 2nd Feb 2018. Global stock indices are starting to recover albeit expectation is for the "correction" to continue owing to "overvaluation". Oil wasnt spared, falling 4% on the 6th Feb 2018.
8509 2018-02-07 06:05:17 Shea moisture anything. That shit brings life to my curls. Otherwise I stick to coconut or almond oil and just try not to wash too often.
8510 2018-02-07 06:05:09 There are no oil by rail projects proposed that connect Alberta to China through BC so it’s not an argument that requires refuting at this point. However just because it’s safer doesn’t mean it’s worth the risk. To BC it’s not.
8511 2018-02-07 06:05:05 ....ehh?!//;; Where did all the chili oil go?!
8512 2018-02-07 06:05:00 Focusing on the supermarket plastic bags is diversion which is entirely suitable to the oil industry.
There is much more plastic in product packaging and oil consumed travelling to and from the supermarket.

8514 2018-02-07 06:04:48 Putin respects a strong leader like Trump. But Putin is also Russia first. 
Over 62% of Russian export is  hydrocarbons. (oil,gas,etc). Military balance is also   important to Putin.   It is not in Russia Economic or security interest
to  have  a strong Trump presidency.
8515 2018-02-07 06:04:36 Sadly, your dad wants to set oil rigs out there in the water. It kind of ruins the view, and the oil crusted birds washing up on the shore are not very aesthetically pleasing, either.

8521 2018-02-07 06:03:40 And we don't work in the Oil & Gas industry, but it still directly affects us! It seems that most people in BC don't like to admit Canada relies on natural resources to keep our currency strong. If it wasn't for Alberta's oil & gas. We'd likely be using American dollars by now!
8522 2018-02-07 06:02:44 A day after oil was swept up in a global market rout, crude is rebounding as investor focus snaps back to U.S. supplies.Brent for April settlement rose 46 cents to $67.32 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, snapping a three-day decline.

8532 2018-02-07 06:01:34 Circulation ... are you diabetic? Do you have any peppermint oil or mustard oil? Something that increases circulation ... massage the foot & leg.
8533 2018-02-07 06:01:23 That does not refute the fact that pipelines are safer than other methods. In 2013 15 billion gallons of oil were moved thru pipelines. Thats 2.384 trillion litres. All those spills you curated over a 8 year period combined is about 0.00041932 of the crude tranported in a year.

8536 2018-02-07 06:00:34 Suuuuper petty. Call me when the BC wine industry represents any threat to the Alberta environment. Please science, can we hurry up our retreat from oil. I will sacrifice my fancy minivan.

8538 2018-02-07 06:00:31 Look on Walmart. Farberware (Faberware?) oil less fryer. They were $69 (originally $80)
8539 2018-02-07 06:00:30 Do you forgot Klein gave them bus tickets to bc or Ontario?? Or when oil prices went down and the  economy tanked in Alberta and wave of  albertans came to be for work . Hope for you guys oil prices don't dip again
8540 2018-02-07 06:00:07 Watch out if you get caught with the new forms of marijuana (oil, shatter, wax) in Palm Beach County charged range from synthetic to controlled substance without a prescription. THC is getting less not more legal folks.

8542 2018-02-07 05:59:42 stop taking pain pills
and take white willow bark capsules, which many years ago was the original
“aspirin” or use marjoram oil(muscle and back pain), lavender oil(cramps and
headaches), peppermint oil(stomach and muscle pain), for pain.
8543 2018-02-07 05:59:06 I hate BCNDP with a passion. That said, she is bullying small business for a foreign oil company. In the end, we're all That should matter more.
8544 2018-02-07 05:59:05 still a net importer of oil -- but falling net real oil imports helped in december.   

pretty clear that higher US production will reduce net petrol import in 18, but will prices will be higher than $45 a barrel
8545 2018-02-07 05:58:57 Me and math are like oil and water. We don't get along very well.
8546 2018-02-07 05:58:46 I'm sure you can't make homemade fried chicken with it (if you can thats even better) If air fryers taste just as good, or even better, then it's the better move. Also save money on not buying oil all the time

Your a perpetrator of snake oil lies

Get it right
8552 2018-02-07 05:58:14 Absolutely. I just shake my head. More third world oil. That’s the answer.
8553 2018-02-07 05:58:11 Good for you premier Rachel Notley; I am also boycotting BC wine to support you,even though I live in BC!  It is  rediculous to delay this pipeline any longer. Canada is one country and we need world prices for our oil rather that giving it to the States. We need the revenue!
8554 2018-02-07 05:58:02 @JustinTrudeau You screw up the environment because you sold your soul to the oil companies then have balls to correct the same people you dont give a crap about?
8555 2018-02-07 05:58:00 Trader Joe's Coconut oil is Amazing!
8556 2018-02-07 05:57:57 Right now we all basically depend on oil. Food, transportation, heat/survival, everything you own (probably on a train, ship or truck at some point) etc. Our clothes, to these electronic things we are currently on, all have been impacted by oil. It will be hard to replace that.

8558 2018-02-07 05:57:53 Has the oil changed ownership? Someone was quoted, “..they want me to leave “MY OIL”...?
8559 2018-02-07 05:57:31 Just found out that there's a fragrance oil called "zombie." Boy, just what cosplay needed: smell-o-vision.
8560 2018-02-07 05:57:24 seems fair to asks the question of whether debit sinks or floats. An oil spill on the cost (or along our rivers) would be costly - economically and environmentally.
8561 2018-02-07 05:57:23 Pwede yaaan kaso onti lang na school nag-ooffer, more likely to be near oceans since oil yung main focus niyan :<. Everyday swimming HAHAHAHAHA
8562 2018-02-07 05:57:23 I have a nonstick veggie grill basket that I throw right next to the steaks. Toss it in salt/pepper and olive oil, and it's really good.
8563 2018-02-07 05:57:21 Eggs I usually use apple sauce but went with coconut oil this time. Depends on what I’m making. They actually came out pretty good!
8564 2018-02-07 05:56:51 I’ve been using buffet, the 2% retanoid, and the rose hip oil together and I love the mix. I’ve also tried the lactic 10% and it was waaaay too strong for me and I’m not sensitive at all and the moisturizer was too silicone based/pilled on me.

8572 2018-02-07 05:55:34 Reasonably accurate considering this writer mostly only covers oil news too... The NYT is a long way from the days of Green Ink when it actually had renewable experts as reporters.

Wish he'd looked into all ACWA's incredible PV + CSP projects a bit more
8573 2018-02-07 05:55:20 Canada's PM Trudeau is too busy welcoming Islamic terrorists 2 Canada & fighting vets in court to worry about new oil pipelines 4 revenue. He has given millions to Syria, Iran, & he's cutting Canada's already meager peace keeping deployments. The child is a tool of the globalists

8575 2018-02-07 05:54:46 My solution to the BC/Alberta trade war:  BC will pay for environmental cleanup of wine spills in Alberta, and Alberta will pay for environmental cleanup of oil spills in BC #cdnpoli
8576 2018-02-07 05:54:16 Think about it Tracy, the oil moves regardless.  If you really cared about the environment and did an inch of research you would understand it is far safer for the environment for oil to move in a pipeline verses rail or truck.  Think!
8577 2018-02-07 05:54:04 @Shell_US @Shell I just got a recruitment offer letter from a company called BG group which says that it works with shell oil and gas company i just want to check with someone weather my offer letter is genuine or not. I tried contacting shell but I received no response.

8594 2018-02-07 05:50:34 Lamest argument ever. Just because we want to protect our waters and our ecosystems does not mean we want to stop using oil altogether. Just reduce its use. Use it for things we NEED, not just things we WANT.
8595 2018-02-07 05:50:24 Doctor Sessions also recommends you take a spoonful of Geritol and rub some Cod Liver Oil on it.

8603 2018-02-07 05:49:07 Dear World, the oil spill is killing my friends, polluting our water, and destroying our homes.  We are sad. Please stop it. Love, SpongeBob

8606 2018-02-07 05:48:06 Yours should be pre-seasoned. Just clean with soap and water afterwards, then rinse and heat to evaporate the water. Then just coat with some oil or shortening. Easy cheesey. Just don't soak or leave wet. If you take care of it, you have a few years until you need to re-season.

8611 2018-02-07 05:47:24 Correct. Sanctions for not allowing our oil to get to market.
8612 2018-02-07 05:47:09 @Piers_Corbyn do you get paid with oil money for each tweet?

8624 2018-02-07 05:45:40 The old family recipe suggests to cut slivers in the skin before taking a swig of oil with a handful of salt. Swirl mixture in mouth then spray the contents of your mouth upon the beasts skin.
8625 2018-02-07 05:45:29 Typical fear mongering. How do pipelines and oil tankers kill salmon orcas and the tourism industry. Please be pragmatic about national issues.
8626 2018-02-07 05:45:21 We've had 20 plus years to develop clean alternative energy and the Republicans did everything in their power to kill clean energy. Oil kills in many ways and it should remain underground.
8627 2018-02-07 05:45:13 Oil is cheap, plentiful, and reliable.
8628 2018-02-07 05:44:59 Oil isn't the future we need to look to, it's called being smart not "holding the economy hostage." Provinces shouldn't be having petty trade wars.
8629 2018-02-07 05:44:58 A cloud of smoke and leaking coolant or oil are bad signs. If the smoke is coming from under the bonnet, you could  have a problem with your radiator. Or, if it’s pouring out of the  exhaust then it might be to do with oil leakage inside the engine and your car should be checked.

8640 2018-02-07 05:43:02 I agree that is how it was originally described but it’s not tar. It’s oil seeping up. It only achieves the tar-like consistency when mixed with other material.  Either way, if you are googling to find out something positive about oil sands, don’t use the term tar sands.

8644 2018-02-07 05:42:18 Just boilerplate snake oil peddlers. This same cult caused a measles outbreak a few years back with this same "don't get vaccinated, gimme ..er i mean Jesus that money" Why are criminals like these running free?
8645 2018-02-07 05:42:12 Tell us who took the gold the frozen assets and money, the oil? There's your answer. If Cameron sarcozy were there to "protect the civilians" how come they abandoned that noble cause as soon as the oil fields were secured?
8646 2018-02-07 05:42:11 It isn't an oil boycott. Alberta oil flows to BC's coast 24/7. It is the expansion and increase in tanker traffic on the Salish sea where Orcas are endangered. Who are we to kill of species for $? What of the salmon and tourist industries? $Billions on the line each way.

8657 2018-02-07 05:39:49 They do on an ongoing basis as they close a section. It really is awesome; far better run than the Baaken Fields in California with a lower GHGs. Yet Hollywood types fly up here to protest? They should look in their own backyard. Canada’s oil sands  companies act responsibly.

8660 2018-02-07 05:38:47 That shit was supposed to be relaxing. I thought the puppy was cute, so I ignore that all I got was polish and shaping, and no other part of the service that I paid for... and then I had to rub in my own cuticle oil.

8671 2018-02-07 05:36:37 Forget value addition, we only know how to deep fry fish in oil, and that's the limit of our culinary art.  You can only add value to a product you are passionate about. We fish for survival, after all other career options are closed, so, with such an approach, no passion.
8672 2018-02-07 05:36:29 Are we raising the issues of Saudi funding to radicalise our youth in madrasas or old Arab men buying Indian teen girls for sex slavery or the torture of Indian labourers in ‘holy’ land? Are we getting oil at $30? What is this visit about?
8673 2018-02-07 05:35:53 Thank you.
The irony of the Coca-Cola/Pepsi analogy for me?
I'm sensitive to the lime oil that Coca-Cola uses in their formulas and can't drink it after years of doing so.
Pepsi uses orange oil which I can tolerate just fine.
Though I haven't had a Pepsi either since May 2004.

8679 2018-02-07 05:35:09 More than the oil sands, believe it or not, the oil sands don’t make up the whole of the oil industry, get you facts straight
8680 2018-02-07 05:35:07 I think it’s a cool, inspiring, and fun bit of relief in a time where we have a President that wants to dig up more coal, drill for oil off of every coast, and loot the country for profit while destroying the environment.

8684 2018-02-07 05:34:23 Really! that is stupid. they should keep at em about cleaning up spills and giving us a decent share of the profit. those are the real issues. we buy oil at a world market price when its supposed to be in our backyard. pissy bans are pointless

8688 2018-02-07 05:33:40 Not too niche. It’s tied to Canada’s oil exports and our access to markets and refineries outside the US. 

And environmental (or labour wage/mobility) trade barriers between nations and provinces are being negotiated right now. 

Keep ‘em coming.

8690 2018-02-07 05:33:35 It's cool that everyone in Canada thinks "our leader is hot" is acceptable praxis with which to thumb their nose at us while also forgetting that oil sands in Alberta are killing many of their poorest citizens :)

8722 2018-02-07 05:29:16 1. That would be Sunflower oil (naturally containing so-called Vitamin E), but Sunflower oil is just that --- Sunflower oil. Vitamin E is big because Vitamin E is a beauty element and a lot of women purchase Vitamin E oil for beautiful skin and nails purposes
8723 2018-02-07 05:29:11 Bought Kirkland hazelnut spread at Costco today. First time to see it, made with sunflower oil instead of palm oil. It’s a close Nutella dupe. And since it comes in a pack of two huge jars, I will not be buying Nutella until 2020.

8734 2018-02-07 05:28:31 This is another conduit for criminal greed. Recall when Eskom & Jimmy were shouting about "WMC" contracts, while doubling down with Gupta Coal Contracts, doubling their prices.

You're being played by the same " WMC" snake oil ruse.
8735 2018-02-07 05:28:25 Adam, there is very little economic arguments for building these pipelines beyond 'grow the most carbon intensive oil in the world'
8736 2018-02-07 05:28:15 Just use coconut oil, shea butter. Keep it by the radiator so  it will be melted. Plus cheaper than all manufactured creams.

By the way U will loose this battle unless Alta's attitude towards Canada changes. remember Alta is land locked US does not need our oil price proves it
8741 2018-02-07 05:27:37 US provided a lot of demand to the world in q4 ...

Monthly "real" non-petrol trade deficit (see exhibit 11 of the BEA's release) jumped from ~ $60b in Sept to close to $70b in Dec thanks to strong imports.

Widening non-oil deficit masked a bit by low oil imports in December
8742 2018-02-07 05:27:21 Thank you James for the response. My question is when we bought the oil it came with 2 packs but one has already been opened which is how we discovered the dissatisfied smell. Can we still request for a refund despite one being opened?

8751 2018-02-07 05:26:32 It's good to admit that you don't care about Canada's laws. People like you run in politics and then disdain the laws of the country you are supposed to represent. Nice. I voted for you. Shame on me, too. 

Oh - I suppose you don't drive a car either? No oil for BC coming soon.
8752 2018-02-07 05:26:16 Still producing the virgin coconut oil? Haven't seen it for a while. Where can I find it @KentasteLtd

8758 2018-02-07 05:25:25 Ittar is an essential oil derived from botanical sources. The oils are generally distilled into a wood base such as sandalwood and then aged. The ageing period can last from one to ten years depending on the botanicals used and the results desired. Did you know?

8763 2018-02-07 05:24:43 Was my first thought.  Back up Today.  Fluctuations are normal and speculative happenings effect the numbers. Like price of oil going up before a hurricane, speculating demand will be greater than supply due to potential rig shutdowns.
8764 2018-02-07 05:24:43 That's my only iffy part, but Finland is rolling a geological repository system, I want to know how that turns out. I believe in oil provinces such as Alberta and Saskatchewan, nuclear power would be a great asset to supplement the burden of the oil industry
8765 2018-02-07 05:24:39 All great ideas!  I see you phase out oil heating and raise you phasing out natural gas heat.
8766 2018-02-07 05:24:37 Oil diffuser! I have a small one in my room in the basement of my house and when I put lavender oil in it I can smell it all the way upstairs lol plus then you get the benefits of essential oils

8773 2018-02-07 05:23:36 I think it is more 'SEEN to be standing up for working people'. Though many Albertans may not realise it, their interests are in moving on from the oil economy. The normal state of affairs in Alberta cannot be 'oil boom'.
8774 2018-02-07 05:23:26 Should’ve never stopped messing with oil paint. Forgot how messy it can get tho. Heh
8775 2018-02-07 05:23:24 I swear if I see one more person tell someone to drink castor oil to induce labor I’m gonna flip the fuck out
8776 2018-02-07 05:23:05 The only thing that is clear from all this is that you use false equivalence, wine does not harm your env, oil does. Stop grasping for the past, embrace the future and reform Alberta's economy. If you want to see what awaits such petroleum economies, look at Russia. Thank you!

8799 2018-02-07 05:20:09 Zack youre right. Lots of uneducated people who cite partial stats. China is using every form of energy including coal, oil, electric and solar. China is building more coal plants across Africa. Idealists talk about using trucks when Canada’s energy pipelines are best & safest

8801 2018-02-07 05:19:54 A new study reveals a chemical found in McDonald's French fries may be the cure for baldness. Scientists from Japan said the chemical is added to the fries in order to keep the cooking oil from frothing up. This is the first time they have mass produced "hair follicle germs."

8807 2018-02-07 05:18:43 Congrats to VA for finally passing a medical marijuana bill. Fingers crossed it will allow for docs to prescribe CBD oil to anxiety patients, and my insurance will help me swallow the price tag that i normally have to pay in full bimonthly. It's not cheap, and it's so necessary.
8808 2018-02-07 05:18:37 Baby oil always worked on me when I’d put on sticker tatts as a kid. 
8809 2018-02-07 05:18:31 a good brush is a much better choice imo. You get it under a bit of hot water when it’s still hot, scrub scrub scrub, then put it back on a hot stove to dry out. Then flax seed or vegetable oil rub down

8838 2018-02-07 05:14:41 I agree Mike. Tripling the amount of oil being sent east creates jobs at all levels. Good for Alberta, BC and Canada.
8839 2018-02-07 05:14:38 Oil and Gas put food on my table and paid my bills for over 7yrs I worked for the accommodations companies and at the Nexen plant. I know from personal experience the countless hours and money spent on safety protocols ensuring the environment will be looked after.

8848 2018-02-07 05:13:10 @jkenney’s proposal would also hurt Alberta. The oil industry doesn’t even support the idea. Kenny is good at making noise, but that’s about it. #abpoli
8849 2018-02-07 05:13:09 Unfortunately, British Columbians disagree. Port Metro Vancouver is the ideal location for a pipeline expansion, specifically because the Port has the necessary infrastructure to contain an oil spill, whereas further north does not.
8850 2018-02-07 05:12:51 Or crabassing because I’m pms’ing or going through the monthly oil change or being totally logistical and neurotic in the kitchen because I’m sure a recipe is going to fail etc etc 
8851 2018-02-07 05:12:51 The answer is obvious - it always has been - refine the shit before you put it in the pipeline! End of problem,  plus thousands of good jobs. Oil companies don't want to do it?  Let BC entrepreneurs do it.
8852 2018-02-07 05:12:51 BC isn't killing jobs - just not into expansion.  Try walk in our shoes too & help protect the coast & get on with clean energy transition. We can do it & save the oil for us where & when it's needed. Can't fix our coast after a spill.
8853 2018-02-07 05:12:45  any recommendations on a face wash that helps treat/prevent acne and gets rid of oil?

8858 2018-02-07 05:12:08 @nenshi the way I see it, bc takes a lot of the risk in oil transporting with regard to spills and there related cleanup, espcecially on the coast. yet, BC makes little of the profit that goes oil sales. which to me seems a great imbalance. R Notleys wine ban is just whining
8859 2018-02-07 05:11:41 Alright lovelies - got a personal question for you. 

How fast does your hair greasy and what dry shampoo do you use? 

Or alternative so you don't have to wash your hair daily/look like you could lube engine parts by scraping oil off your head. (That's just me? Hmm...)

I don't know what offerings alberta has made to deal with that but it needs to be addressed.

8942 2018-02-07 04:58:57 なでなでしてくれにゃo(>ω< )o
8943 2018-02-07 04:58:45 W O W, I’m so glad that the AB government is taking a stance against small, local BC businesses in favour of big oil??????????????? Sooooo heroic
8944 2018-02-07 04:58:40 I gotcha sis I’m gonna try making a DIY hair oil soon
8945 2018-02-07 04:58:38 @BSladeNow second of all, everyone going in on your backpack! Get that jawn in your online store immediately! Tell people the oil is in there. Lol
8946 2018-02-07 04:58:22 gotta shower my face feels like a literal oil slick
8947 2018-02-07 04:58:21 shaved and lathered myself in cocoa butter oil so not only do i feel soft as hell but i smell like a motherfuckin snackkk
8948 2018-02-07 04:57:56 Oil is 23% of our economy....
8949 2018-02-07 04:57:49 I really want thick bushy brows but I feel like the girls on YT telling tales when they say coconut oil is all you need to make them grow
8950 2018-02-07 04:57:34 you have no idea what your talking about. oil and nat gas don't just magically appear in a pipline. surveys>geogolists>leases>drill>wellhead>completions>flowback>pipeline>compressor>pipeline>export, and many many many more jobs and workers in between.
8951 2018-02-07 04:57:33 True. CBC radio featured audio clip from "As it Happens" discussing Suncorp switching to automated trucks in oil sands. Worth a listen.
8952 2018-02-07 04:57:32 I was thinking something more like Myke Cole, the face of Manliest Man Beard Oil
8953 2018-02-07 04:57:23 This article compares past oil sands  royalties representing a tiny fraction of the developable resources mostly in the pre-payout phase of the royalty structure to the total future clean up costs for the entire resource. Try posting something economically literate please.
8954 2018-02-07 04:57:15 apparently if you put body oil on the places you put perfume (inner wrist and whatnot) before spraying your perfume on, the smell will last longer! i haven’t tried it yet, i just read it today 
8955 2018-02-07 04:57:07 Girl be careful when I got lash extensions I wanted to take them off and it ripped a chunk of my real ones out. I would rub oil on your lashes when your ready to take them off.

8957 2018-02-07 04:56:48 cool, we'll just just transport the Oil by rail, much safer right?
8958 2018-02-07 04:56:44 Eastern Canada buys oil at world prices, while Alberta needs to sell it's oil below North American prices. The differential is $25 billion dollars that people in Eastern Canada pay in premiums over what they could pay.
8959 2018-02-07 04:56:34 The only sane course of action is for those of us on BC to buy and drink twice as much wine!

And we can't drink and drive since we have no oil. Checkmate, Alberta.
8960 2018-02-07 04:56:32 truth be told, i'd prefer if AB bottled its oil and BC piped its wine (as long as there's a great chance for a spill) #GreatWineWarOf2018 #bcpoli #ableg

8962 2018-02-07 04:56:13 for prevention, I drink a lot of shots of organic apple cider vinegar when I know my body is fighting something, like 6 tblspn a day. Now that I'm not nursing, I also take the antiviral or oil of oregano extract. It works, I rarely get sick.
8963 2018-02-07 04:56:12 Get your mind out the gutter. I’m just here to give friendly tips like drinking water and using non-alcoholic products to clean their faces. Also, castor oil is a great tool.
8964 2018-02-07 04:56:12 Pinterest-ing before I fall asleep & now I want to try oil pulling.
8965 2018-02-07 04:56:11 Please remember oil is just not for cars. Oil is used in all levels of machines. Even your latte machine uses oil. #hypocrisy
8966 2018-02-07 04:55:53 no its not weed oil. Its like hooka. Trust if I could smoke the weed oil I would. 
8967 2018-02-07 04:55:44 Olive oil.
8968 2018-02-07 04:55:35 That's really a nice 'oil hit poem',really.
But...here's a question...
Who wrote that?????(someone in the mission team???)
:)
8969 2018-02-07 04:55:28 It’s about time. Tom O’Connor rides that Israel and Lebanon are going to war over natural gas? Yeah Hezbolla    A big oil and gas producer?  Time to get rid of that guy
8970 2018-02-07 04:55:21 How about the oil tankers that come from Washington or Saudi ? Much safer
8971 2018-02-07 04:55:12 Just remember #EXXON VALDEZ we are STILL paying nearly 30 yrs later.  I REMEMBER & I understand BCs concerns well! You are pushing for this too quickly BC has a right to ask for EVERY safeguard, one #oil disaster will destroy their coasts!!!  They have more to lose than Alberta!
8972 2018-02-07 04:54:52 How can China afford the wine if their is no oil for the shipping containers to get across the pacific?
8973 2018-02-07 04:54:30 You hear about leaks all the time in Pipelines and oil spills do happen as well from tankers. And when it does it's catastrophic for the environment. Takes many years to turn it around from that. Our coastline does not need any of that crap. Too beautiful. Jmo
8974 2018-02-07 04:54:21 I wanna see him homeless begging Irsay for a janitor position at lucas oil after the Belichick era

8977 2018-02-07 04:53:59 Port wine and truffles will do that, I e noticed. It’s a lovely orange color - I’m sure the egg yolks helped - but the port... just wow.

And it never broke - even the extra in the bowl. The oil you see is from the garlic confit. I’m a fanatic about a good hollandaise.
8978 2018-02-07 04:53:53 100% agreed, read what I said.  Nothing about oil being today's cheapest/best fuel.  Just that we never would have reached the technological heights we have without it.

It's all oil, genius.
8981 2018-02-07 04:53:33 @Newsweek What’s with Tom or Conor coverage of the Middle East? Is he lying or just stupid? Middle is next oil war ? Lebanon and Hezbolla?  R U KIDDING
Time to shut it down
8982 2018-02-07 04:53:32 I lost my bio oil
8983 2018-02-07 04:53:03 sorry ran out of room....a handshake no, but neither was I expecting butting in on land that is not part of Alberta. There are other ways to move oil, we're just saying this isn't the best way for our province.
8984 2018-02-07 04:53:01 It still happens. Yes all of life is what if really? But I for one will support this pipeline at all and Alberta getting all the money and have to pay for the damage if it happens. Clean energy, solar power, wind power e t c.. is the way of the future not the oil sands.
8985 2018-02-07 04:52:51 When someone rappels off the end and scoops up some oil with a measuring cup, I'll believe it.
We have airplanes. At least fly off the edge & bring back pictures.

2 types of people....
8997 2018-02-07 04:51:58 Nah, that shower was amazing!! Nothing feels better than a hot shower, exfoliating then putting oil on 
8998 2018-02-07 04:51:49 Indeed. BC should start a buy BC wine campaign & protect Canadian coasts campaign. BC shld also advocate cutting down on meat consumption (particularly beef from oil county). Not only good for the environment, but BC would save on health care costs in the long term.
8999 2018-02-07 04:51:41 He's a snake oil salesman, but a very good snake oil salesman. And if his space plans carry fruit its a fruit that can be taken to public or workers' ownership. He might become emperor of Mars, but the political game would be the same on red planet as its on Earth.

9001 2018-02-07 04:51:15 I've never ever had a fish oil burp
9002 2018-02-07 04:50:55 I am coming to realize that my pain tolerance is almost non existent. 

Currently dying of tooth pain and using clove oil every 2 hours cause I don’t have the stomach for it
9003 2018-02-07 04:50:50 Looks bullish but not a suggestion to get long. Just looking at XLE you'd think oil crashed too
9004 2018-02-07 04:50:47 They probably get it from fish oil pills. Omega vitamins.

9009 2018-02-07 04:50:09 Premier Notley, if you accept the science of climate change, you should understand we need to stop expanding the usage of fossil fuels for the sake of our children.   

And if you accept reality, you know that major oil spills cannot be cleaned up.

Stop.

9013 2018-02-07 04:49:39 Great Rab. Can you also put everything from your car to the smallest plastic knob out for recycling. Without oil all manufacturing stops as machines wont work to make your to go cup on your latte or anything else.
9014 2018-02-07 04:49:36 Pure unrefined Coconut oil is the best for your skin
9015 2018-02-07 04:49:33 Lol no but seriously isn’t that weed? I never get the oil thing..like it’s oil weed
9016 2018-02-07 04:49:27 Coconut oil on my hair is like heaven. 
9017 2018-02-07 04:49:26 You know that there are 100s of BC wineries right? And that there’s also foreign investment in the oil patch?

9020 2018-02-07 04:49:15 Also agree with your stance on oil I’m lightly short but it’s strong and energy sector has sold off so much idk how it can go lower supporting at least above 60 range on CL. Made a lot on DRIP so ok with giving some back
9021 2018-02-07 04:49:07 வண்டில  incredible india- னு  எழுதுனவன் எல்லாம்....இப்போ save oil... save india -னு  எழுதி வச்சிருக்கான்!!!

9023 2018-02-07 04:48:35 Kuwait was diagonal oil drilling into Iraqi oil fields. The incubator stories were lies. How would Texas react to Mexican diagonal drilling?

We should admit Iraq was right and we rushed to judgement without due diligence.
9024 2018-02-07 04:48:34 We have jobs in BC that would be threatened in the event of an oil spill. Are our workers worth less than those of Alberta?
9025 2018-02-07 04:48:26 at this point i care who controls our oil as long as i can feed me and mine
9026 2018-02-07 04:48:15 "Someone loyal is worth more than striking oil."
9027 2018-02-07 04:48:12 Fish oil and glucosamine every day
9028 2018-02-07 04:47:44 Well it’s my freaking backyard if things get screwed up, Ms. Notley. Oil is not the future. I can’t wait until it’s fully in the past.
9029 2018-02-07 04:47:39 I know "..force oil companies.." doesn't sound realistic. But that's the problem. Not lack of data, or solutions to clean up.
9030 2018-02-07 04:47:26 There are more natural pain relievers they could have been pushing for pain instead.. like THC and CBD oil. These type of pain relievers are non addictive and very effective and they do not kill people. Yet people are so blind!

9032 2018-02-07 04:46:45 Nah it’s his publicity—oil company CEOs don’t tweet like him. Also, libertarians and liberals don’t glorify oil execs but they do Musk.
9033 2018-02-07 04:46:34 I was going to say use Cantu I use it on Mariah and it is great.... Although nothing is perfect. I did find an Argon oil shampoo and it's been great in Jalens hair. May try it in Mariah's 
9034 2018-02-07 04:46:24 Cut back on the salad. Steamed broccoli and oven cooked asparagus >>> salad. 
Pour butter on the broccoli or avocado oil on the asparagus to get bonus fat too. 
9035 2018-02-07 04:46:16 If you wanted to send a message, just stop sending them any oil and gas. I can't wait until BC stops sending us their lumber. I'm very supportive of making a strong Alberta. They stop sending lumber you will regret this decision.
9036 2018-02-07 04:46:09 @RachelNotley Our environment isn’t for sale, BC won’t sell itself out for anyone. I don’t think you’ve met us yet? More wine for us! Cheers  #KinderMorgan #pipeline #indigenousrights #water #waterprotectors #firstpeople #oil #climatechange
9037 2018-02-07 04:46:03 ...Or we could force oil companies, who've all known about it's role in climate change since the 70's to phase out fossil fuels immediately.
9038 2018-02-07 04:46:02 Awesome, let's send all you hard ass boomers to fight the bullshit wars for opium and oil, then.

9043 2018-02-07 04:44:46 You have the most interesting interactions ever. It is like you tapped into some high pressure oil reserve and it cannot be controlled.
9044 2018-02-07 04:44:44 I like how politicians now have the mature capacity if the average 7 grader. 

I mean, not that I care, but you literally equate wine spills to oil spills. Seriously, how did you get into power?
9045 2018-02-07 04:44:32 Has any group stolen more than the crude oil that the North steals from the south? Has any group killed more than the terrorist bread from the North who continue’s its ethnic & religious genocide of the South without accountability! Why does the North insist on remaining united

9048 2018-02-07 04:44:00 Coconuts are literally the best things ever. I mean, coconut milk & coconut oil are two of the best things to exist bc of them.
9049 2018-02-07 04:43:40 bitch i just made the best filet mignon i threw that hoe to cook in some olive oil w butter some garlic &amp; thyme n that shit rockin
9050 2018-02-07 04:43:37 Yes !!!! And then the sauce on top is just tomatoe onion garlic basil artichoke and a little water from a blender and mushrooms were marinated w Himalayan salt olive oil balsamic vinegar lemon juice and a garlic clove haha it was super quick and easy !!!
9051 2018-02-07 04:43:28 So, BC gets a high risk pipeline, full of high CO2 oil, and in 2019 Albertans elect a conservative government, and it all gets tossed out the window. Except the pipeline.
9052 2018-02-07 04:43:28 Oil, acrylic or watercolor?
9053 2018-02-07 04:43:28 Oooo good!! That’s like the only oil I can use!!
9054 2018-02-07 04:43:11 Will clove oil in mouthwash work? via /r/Dentistry

So I have a Pretty painful tooth infection going on right now and I just bought some clove oil and I heard that that can help servere tooth pain my question is if I mix it with mouthwash say about 1 or 2 drops before I use …
9055 2018-02-07 04:42:49 Yeah, imagine my surprise when looking for diagrams to oil it that it's 'vintage'. J & I remember when we bought it! 
9056 2018-02-07 04:42:43 Yeah, because wine spills and oil spills are the same. Smfh.

9060 2018-02-07 04:41:45 the oil on that damn pillar made me smell like lube for a week
9061 2018-02-07 04:41:28 your right we could use the whale oil instead
9062 2018-02-07 04:41:27 Yea, Um Alberta doesnt exactly do very well in terms of freshwater quality, air quality, or biodiversity. And the vulnerability of an ecosystem to irreparable damage via say contamination by oil spill isnt a straight line. Some areas are far more vulnerable than others.
9063 2018-02-07 04:41:14 bitch i just made the best filet mignon i threw that hoe to cook in some olive oil w butter some garlic & thyme n that shit rockin
9064 2018-02-07 04:40:54 AND THEN no more than 5 minutes after she tries to convince me the olive oil she has is in fact vegetable oil.

9072 2018-02-07 04:39:56 Russia will try to help the Democrat because  they want a weak America. 
Trump policy of energy independence  will hurt Russia.  Because Russia main export is oil. By trump pushing for oil drilling it drives the oil price down. Russia also does not like Americas military build up
9073 2018-02-07 04:39:37 PR still without power n Flint Michigan still paying for tainted water. Indian reservation still dealing with oil seepage on their land! I could go on n on. Get something completed Don!
9074 2018-02-07 04:39:27 The whole thing is frankly unfathomable. I want an oil painting of it.
9075 2018-02-07 04:39:24 sure I get it. but read up on EV and especially eTruck adoption rates. 

when oil demand drops in 5 years, prices will crater. 

AB oil sands - and anything else that is not cost competitive with cheap oil - will suffer with permanently depressed oil prices. 

then what?
9076 2018-02-07 04:39:20 Dear BC, 
On behalf of the ppl here in Alberta, I apologize for the stupidity of our gov't of sucking up to Big Oil instead of caring for our environment. #bcwine @RachelNotley #disappointed #usedtosupportNDP

9081 2018-02-07 04:38:22 @RachelNotley  stop using condensate to thin out heavy oil, haul or rail light oil from Estevan area. You can’t recover condensate from a river spill

9085 2018-02-07 04:37:39 Olives..... Olivia......olive oil
9086 2018-02-07 04:37:27 @RachelNotley and her government need to remember who they are, Canadians. As Canadian as the families and small businesses that will be affected by their #bcwine boycott. This isn’t appropriate policy, this is big oil beating up the little man.
9087 2018-02-07 04:37:15 How do you like that Pipeline now.  Gas prices are the highest in North America & will go higher! Vancouver Buying USA oil is expensive but ..... what the hell you can pipeline it in from the USA & Canadian Govt will get O. Congrats BC

9089 2018-02-07 04:36:59 Not unlike the hundreds of thousands of workers in the oil and gas economy across Alberta AND BC. All we want is the constitution, the LAW respected.
9090 2018-02-07 04:36:51 g dikasi tau knp nya sama yg tulis gtu diblognya, cuma blg dia tau dr acara k-beauty...mungkin biar g kebal sama kandungan oil nya kali ya~ btw, pernah pke biore japan makeup remover oil cleansing g?
9091 2018-02-07 04:36:38 Ya exactly I think what makes everyone so addicted to highlighter is the fact that it's sooo pretty and shiny in the pan but once it's on the face it looks like sweat/oil
9092 2018-02-07 04:36:16 I realized I’m hitting rock bottom. I’m taking my makeup off with olive oil.
9093 2018-02-07 04:36:10 First of all. The video for All The Stars is the best thing I’ve ever seen in my entire life. To the point where my edges aren’t even gone. They’re moisturized and neatly laid with black castor oil after watching that video.

9097 2018-02-07 04:35:42 REMEMBER EXXON VALDEZ!  Persistent oil poisoning, and a cascade of ecological effects, continue. There's not much we can do now for Prince William Sound, short of protecting it from more harm. @jkenney @RachelNotley maybe why BC is so worried???
9098 2018-02-07 04:35:35 Hmm now what shall we ban?
Alberta beef? Pretty good but we can support BC cattle only...Ok help me out what else do we really want from AB? Their oil/gas is so heavily taxed...hmm
9099 2018-02-07 04:35:27 If you really want to hurt Americans....buy Canadian oil.
9100 2018-02-07 04:35:09 Oil and Water
9101 2018-02-07 04:35:06 Put a 90% royalty in the oil and maybe we’ll take you seriously. Otherwise it’s clear you’re just working to deliver $1 billion a year into the pockets of an American oil company.
9102 2018-02-07 04:34:59 Oil is not the whole economy.
9103 2018-02-07 04:34:59 It takes about 20 min to change it yourself... costs about $20.  Our local recycling takes motor oil.
9104 2018-02-07 04:34:21 Unlike Alta's failing,polluting oil industry, #bcfisheries and tourism are sustainable. A better long term investment for the country. So support your #Alberta #CraftBeer industry- it's your healthiest future #wearethewest
9105 2018-02-07 04:33:57 From what I have seen the people in BC who oppose TMX don’t actually care much about GHG emissions. They are mainly just scared of an oil spill

9118 2018-02-07 04:32:01 @DianneC_BC Great pick Tzeporah - did you know these Okanagan grapes were fertilized, grown, fermented and transported using Canadian ethical oil! Can you believe this @DanAlbas @bobzimmermp @MichelleRempel @JohnBarlowMP! #CDNpoli #BCpoli #BCwine #BuildKM 
9119 2018-02-07 04:31:56 Why not let the People of the USA decide whether they want their land to be handed over to Big Oil / Big Money instead of allowing a President who didn’t even know what ANWR was three months ago.
9120 2018-02-07 04:31:49 @dandyduzzi thank you, THANK YOU.  I have suffered for 31 years in searing pain, SUFFERING while avoiding opioids.  Sleeping on ice, ETOH, icing 6-7 hours a day.   Love to learn how to move ahead with SB726. Ironically CBD oil has been for sale in Roanoke CoOp. DM me
9121 2018-02-07 04:31:47 The Polembros Odyssey transporting oil to NL would have been a far larger fire when it broke up, but it goes forgotten because Canada was importing oil instead of exporting it.
9122 2018-02-07 04:31:31 #bcwine @RachelNotley The solution is simple refine the oil in Alberta. Dead simple, refine the oil in Alberta
9123 2018-02-07 04:31:28 the amound ot coconut oil on my phone is ridiculous

9127 2018-02-07 04:31:15 That's my point, sorry if I was unclear. I was bothered by your use of an appeal to emotion to justify pipeline transport, which is the safest way to transport oil.

9141 2018-02-07 04:30:12 This all wraps around to energy lobbyists.. who aren't pushing clean energy at all.  They are focused on oil and natural gasses.. and cash flow from pipelines running though the Ukraine.  #JustSayin
9142 2018-02-07 04:30:09 Exactly.. relieved those oil companies are getting the “sweetheart deals”

9145 2018-02-07 04:29:48 “Our” ? Who told you this land was “ours”? 
I’m guessing you picked up on a Big Oil / Retrumplican talking point and it stuck. 
This land belongs to All Americans and not Big Oil / Big Money interests no matter how many politicians they buy

9162 2018-02-07 04:27:34 There are, of course, risks to crude oil shipments. But giant, violent, fireball explosions that vaporize humans are not generally among them.
9163 2018-02-07 04:27:29 As an Edmonton taxpayer, my livelihood comes from the oil and gas industry, as do many Edmontonians.  I would like to know why my municipal government is misusing our resources to spread propaganda from a radical American left wing organisation intent on our destruction?
9164 2018-02-07 04:27:23 I've been acting brand new ever since I got my essential oil diffuser

9169 2018-02-07 04:26:47 Music promotion is like oil for a band that wants to get noticed by music fans!
9170 2018-02-07 04:26:34 I agree completely. lets have alternate fuels and energy. wind, solar, natural gas.
we need to get over burning crude oil products as soon as possible.
renewable clean energy is the only way forward. the quicker we realize that the better we will all be. including alberta.
9171 2018-02-07 04:26:13 Not all of the oil comes from Alberta, some of it, for that specific refinery, comes from Northern BC.

And it is still a small amount.

Plus, with less oil, we will have to move to renewable energy sources. It would actually benefit us, and harm Alberta, in the long run.
9172 2018-02-07 04:26:13 People always tell me how soft my skin is "when they shake my hand they say "you have baby skin it's SO soft" LOL I use Shea butter, cocoa butter, and coconut oil with lavender essential oilI slather it on right after a shower or bath. Works wonders #Holistic #SkinCare
9173 2018-02-07 04:26:03 then announce a gradual withdrawal of all oil and gas subsidies. use the $ to attract new industry.

or don't. 

the age of oil is coming to and end. AB can diversify now or later...
9174 2018-02-07 04:25:26 I think I'm already noticing a positive difference with the cbd oil, I'm so glad man.
9175 2018-02-07 04:25:19 When the hubby runs your bath water and adds oil... you like what is this? Clearly something I bought and never used lol!!!
9176 2018-02-07 04:24:50 In Bizzaro land today. Alberta did the most BC thing possible and used fine wines in a trade dispute over oil. @RachelNotley is going to announce a moratorium on Yoga studios tomorrow and a ban on @VancityReynolds #FightThePower #Alberta #BritishColumbia #FineWhine
9177 2018-02-07 04:24:43 Yeah, so is the Black Forest smoked bacon. But you only need 4 slices or so for a head of cauliflower. It reheats well. Cut the bacon with kitchen shears into pieces about 1/2” wide and scatter over cauliflower. You can use less olive oil if you’re adding bacon.
9178 2018-02-07 04:24:43 Eat shit Naomi. I'm gonna spill some oil in your name.

9180 2018-02-07 04:24:24 I think it plays a little worse at oil and gas companies though. 
9181 2018-02-07 04:24:21 ... and you are aware that after health care, energy, transportation, oil & gas, utilities, and ag-forestry-fisheries comprise 5 of 6 of BCs top GDP contributors, right? Where you be without that? Not in one of those $2 mill Van bungalows buddy.
9182 2018-02-07 04:24:17 dear coconut oil, I love you so much

9186 2018-02-07 04:23:39 We get very little oil from the ME, most comes from the US, and we would be better off using our own oil, not exporting it.
9187 2018-02-07 04:23:28 Day one with CBD oil; can’t tell if it’s placebo or not, but I’m in a better mood?

9191 2018-02-07 04:23:04 And baby oil, even barely there, seems to interfere with my touch screen more than dry skin. I'll have to get a blue tooth keyboard for it. It's just getting frustratingly unproductive.
9192 2018-02-07 04:23:02 5....are bad news for us. There are two reasons why - first, crude palm oil and cocoa and coffee beans, which are products with low-added value, comprise the staggering amount of 75% of our manufactured goods. Second, the pure and simple fact that we keep importing ....

9196 2018-02-07 04:22:22 He should know. He's got one of the largest oil deals in history pending between Rosneft & Exxon. Gee, wonder why the sanctions on Russia weren't enforced by the guy in the WH. Hmmm.... why could that be ?
9197 2018-02-07 04:22:19 its a 2007 Chevy impala LT and its a oil leak from the engine i believe

9199 2018-02-07 04:21:52 Well the ones that go there, probably  wouldn’t want it to be ruined by oil spills. I wonder how many went whale watching? The increase in tanker traffic could kill that entire industry

9206 2018-02-07 04:21:01 I've been this way for years - winter drops humidity and my hands crack they get so dry unless I use eucerin or baby oil.
9207 2018-02-07 04:20:52 We’ve already crippled the Canadian oil industry and our neighbours to the south are just laughing at our naïveté.
9208 2018-02-07 04:20:48 Those are two different discussions. I want those things too. I am just saying might as have oil be efficent as possible while we use it.

were being held hostage.
9212 2018-02-07 04:20:28 if you really want to hurt big oil make better purchasing decisions. stop eating meat, drive an electric car or take transit (or bike), make your home efficient & shop less
9213 2018-02-07 04:20:26 Time to support #BCwines who are caught in the crossfire. Alberta ranchers and breweries next? As a small family business, we hate seeing a large Texas oil corp & AB Gov pulling the strings. Much smaller BC & AB businesses suffer! Trade wars won’t put a pipeline in BC. #BuyBCwine
9214 2018-02-07 04:20:20 Hash oil? 

Classic LaBourdais answer.
9215 2018-02-07 04:20:07 Because they already have enough oil. You don't seem to care that there are shitholes throughout the world that oil will bring them out of poverty. You don't care about them.
9216 2018-02-07 04:19:44 All you’ve done is kill the one thing Canada is good at - exporting resources. Our country of 34mn won’t stand a chance when more populous countries still want and need their oil.
9217 2018-02-07 04:19:44 石油だってオリーブオイルだって牛脂だって仲間さ、そうだろう?
9218 2018-02-07 04:19:40 You do get products that are meant for hydration and still not give you a greasy look. I know your struggle because I'm extremely oily. I use a serum to help with hydration and an oil control moisturiser. Estee lauder has great moisturisers and I use MAC moisture infusion serum

9224 2018-02-07 04:18:51 Worse than Kansas. The roads are shit, schools and healthcare are being cut to give a tax break to oil/gas companies, and it's practically a Southern Baptist theocracy. I call it "Baptistan".
9225 2018-02-07 04:18:48 the sealer on under my engine is causing an oil leak and they have to take out the whole engine to patch it and it cost more than my car is worth!
9226 2018-02-07 04:18:46 oil change in the am.. i better not be there all day. i got shit to do
9227 2018-02-07 04:18:42 It’s just sheer arrogance to think this will change anything. We all know fossil fuels are declining but you are living in a dreamworld if you think oil is going away in the next 15-25 years.
9228 2018-02-07 04:18:26 how about BC rights? what steps does alberta take if there is a spill in BC with albertas oil?
the oilsands could use its own cleanup instead of so many waistelands created. aren't there cleaner ways to extract oil?

9245 2018-02-07 04:15:11 Don’t agree on wine but we need pipelines to get out oil to market. You can’t just switch an economy around overnight it takes decades. So we need oil revenue a bit longer.

9268 2018-02-07 04:12:41 Hope Alberta shuts off the supply of oil to BC forcing the NDP to import oil which would have to be shipped in via tanker traffic. Horgan plays a stupid political game to stroke his own ego
9269 2018-02-07 04:12:40 Appears the answer is no. Not enough pressure to boil oil in an Instant Pot.

how has alberta guaranteed safety and cleanliness and dirty alberta oil if there is a pipeline spill in bc or worse, on bc's coast?
BC takes the risk on its land and coastline while alberta makes most of the money.

9294 2018-02-07 04:07:26 I agree we need oil. We don't NEED to triple capacity to ship to other countries, however.
9295 2018-02-07 04:07:22 The whole point is ... we don't want your oil.

9305 2018-02-07 04:05:36 Oil spills/the risk of one is an unpopular topic in B.C. None of the spills on that pipeline have happened in Alberta as far as I know (there have been 4 I’m aware of). We have more of length of the pipeline in B.C. than in Alberta, we assume a greater risk for spills.
9306 2018-02-07 04:05:31 I live in BC and I find it outrageous that our NDP government wants to block Alberta oil using some BS reason It's beyond disgusting and I've let Horgan know this is disgraceful and extortionate behaviour.

9320 2018-02-07 04:03:12 Since 2014, more Canadians are employed in renewable energy than the oil industry. The jobs are in wind and solar.
9321 2018-02-07 04:03:12 Actually the NDP has been reviving a shitty economy that 40 years of Cons and oil dependence made. She's only doing this now to pander to voters, cuz she's afraid of the UCP.  Too bad because I thought she was doing great until now and I really don't want a UCP gov.

9356 2018-02-07 03:58:54 Steele was a snake oil salesmen who worked for a crooked politician who lost a rigged election. Can you say Hillary? 
9357 2018-02-07 03:58:45 오늘 바람도 안 불고 미세먼지도 많은데 개춥네.
9358 2018-02-07 03:58:44 My new whip looking like a beautiful darkskin girl with coconut oil on her.
9359 2018-02-07 03:58:33 My car is 100 plus tax for an oil change. 
9360 2018-02-07 03:58:14 Have you seen the Alexa fries, frozen. I like the Rosemary ones. I do a lite spray with grape seed oil and do them in the oven.
9361 2018-02-07 03:58:10 We won't see a loosening of big oil's grip on the environment, or the world economy until shipping co's like @UPS and @FedEx and @DHLUS aggressively make that change. Not by putting a few people in space. Humph.
9362 2018-02-07 03:58:09 Hi Hot Babe!!!! I mean, MadX!!!! I love you!!!! I had a great day!!!! Bought sesame oil today!!!!!!! I love you!!!!
9363 2018-02-07 03:57:51 THAT QUOTE FROM the snake oil salesman ABOUT trying to blow up the statue of liberty IS TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT!
9364 2018-02-07 03:57:46 I know of a nearby McCafe that prob has an old french fry oil bin.... WOOO!!
9365 2018-02-07 03:57:39 Should I oil up and hit the gym?
9366 2018-02-07 03:57:37 Oh sweet I never tried bio oil! Maybe I’ll have to try it ! I used to sleep with apricot seed oil on my face every other night and that clears my skin so good but I don’t think it helps with scars :/
9367 2018-02-07 03:57:34 And fried in Vegetable Oil. Though, maybe it's one of those chemical reactions that occurs during frying?
9368 2018-02-07 03:57:28 I won $50 on the super bowl, I was so excited about being able to afford an oil change I wrecked my car #everythingisawesome
9369 2018-02-07 03:57:27 ....you selling snake oil like you were in Dodge City? #BrexitIsRegression
9370 2018-02-07 03:57:16 Experimental hop from Indie Hops/OSU, 10.2%, Fresh tropical citrus, with a hint of wafting joint smoke from around the block. Very “clean” hop, without the tendency that many potent hops have to throw diesel oil notes or cattiness.  Just a refreshing medley of luscious hops
9371 2018-02-07 03:57:15 Folatil oil dlm jahe sudah sejak dulu tbukti bisa mngatasi problem penyumbatan hidung dan sesak nafas
9372 2018-02-07 03:57:06 because our dependence on oil has been cultivated by 100+ years for #bigoil lies, bribes and manipulation. 

in most cases (notably transportation) we have no choice but to use oil products. 

#stopkm
9373 2018-02-07 03:57:05 @theJagmeetSingh Is dead wrong!  Pay down debt, use interest savings on social programs!!  Renegotiate NAFTA, get our oil/natural gas to market and make some money off marijuana!!  Turn Canada into a lending nation instead of a borrower!!  Stick to fundamentals!!
9374 2018-02-07 03:56:54 I couldn’t fix the oil furnace, just went down a notch by my own standards.
9375 2018-02-07 03:56:35 I actually love it!! I pack on all my serums and hydrate enough then i seal them all up with squalane oil. It adds extra moisture to my skin. Also didnt break me out 
9376 2018-02-07 03:56:22 A raw bitumen spill is hardly a proportionate risk to the potential environmental catastrophe that can occur if said raw bitumen spills in a BC waterway.  Refine the oil first into a safer form or get the Feds to sent #EnergyEast to Ontario and Quebec!

9378 2018-02-07 03:56:00 Really ? You do realize Oil is the biggest reason why Oklahoma is in despair.
9379 2018-02-07 03:55:59 Are you kidding? You are killing our economy in your selfish oil guzzling hypocracy....of course we will fight back..you can’t have your cake and eat it too
9380 2018-02-07 03:55:54 Would be better if we had no Doritos at all! horrible product full of palm oil
9381 2018-02-07 03:55:49 Oil change!
9382 2018-02-07 03:55:45 Even Whatcom County is blocking the export of raw oil from Cherry Point.
9383 2018-02-07 03:55:30 Oh I still don’t support them overall but seeing her take some action to stand up for the oil industry is nice to see. I was actually surprised she did something.
9384 2018-02-07 03:55:29 A quart of oil 9 freaking dollars!!
Use to be 2.89. Use to get a oil change anywhere for 20 dollars. Now an oil change will cost you almost a fucking 100 dollars MY GOD 

This is why we can not survive in this country.  

This is OUTRAGEOUS and UNCALLED for.
9385 2018-02-07 03:55:27 The fast fashion industry is the world's second-largest polluter (Right behind the big oil industry!) #fastfashion #fashionfriendly
9386 2018-02-07 03:55:24 Name one oil spill in BC'S oceans. One. Don't bother with the Valdez.  That wasn't in our waters And it was a sile hauled tanker.
9387 2018-02-07 03:55:22 Coconut oil worked for like a week and then broke me out soooo bad and I’ve heard from multiple people that it did the same to them !!
9388 2018-02-07 03:55:13 Let’s spill wine, not oil!!! 
9389 2018-02-07 03:55:12 There was a time that I didn’t know how to take care of my curly hair and my mom put mayonnaise and olive oil in my hair. Things you do to take care of your hair 
9390 2018-02-07 03:55:10 My essential oil diffuser is my new favorite buy 
9391 2018-02-07 03:55:05 So instead they will buy from dirty oil countries like in the middle east. Lesser of two evils.
9392 2018-02-07 03:55:02 WHY TF WOULD ONE OF MY ROOMMATES USE ALL MY EXPENSIVE OLIVE OIL THEN PUT IT BACK
9393 2018-02-07 03:54:51 My coconut and tea tree oil on my head right now is a fucking mess but it's worth it to make my scalp stop itching

9395 2018-02-07 03:54:34 2/2 However as a Canadian I am willing to compromise.  Refine the dangerous-to-transport raw bitumen into a safer form and we can expand the #KinderMorgan pipline.  Heck if Alberta refines the oil into gasoline, you can sell it domestically!
A Win/Win?!?
#bcpoli #vanpoli #canpoli
9396 2018-02-07 03:54:19 When all of Scandinavia, Great Britain and others stop drilling for oil, I’ll be worried. Those countries like to guilt climate change, but continue to drill and take that oil $$$.so I figure it must not be that bad eh?
9397 2018-02-07 03:54:07 Tried oil obsessed total cleanser over the weekend. Let’s just say I’m obsessed and had to get a full size! @bareMinerals killin the skin care game!
9398 2018-02-07 03:53:57 Getting a little older I’m starting to add to my skincare. Little vitamin E oil under the eyes. Little castor oil on eyebrows. Chemical exfoliating mask. I need to reassure this black won’t crack.
9399 2018-02-07 03:53:44 Not one oil job will be lost due to the BC Government’s decision because it’s meaningless. It’s a Federal decision. However Notley’s decision to boycott #BCWine will affect jobs in BC.
9400 2018-02-07 03:53:39 It’s a very similar outlook, that’s for sure. To a certain extent you have to give them some leniency. They are performing some of the most dangerous work on the planet. If the H2S poison gas doesn’t get you, the blowout might. Weighs on your mind after a time.
9401 2018-02-07 03:53:36 Neither can former Liberal cabinet minister Frank McKenna. He recently said no other country would be so "dumb" as Canada by blocking its own oil exports while importing higher priced oil from abroad. What an insane country this is.
9402 2018-02-07 03:53:33 Lavender in my oil diffuser, string lights on twinkling, Brenton Wood playing on the TV. Its a vibe tonight
9403 2018-02-07 03:53:20 Me too.  I wish this pride would also apply to Canadian oil.
9404 2018-02-07 03:53:12 What about patchouli oil though?
9405 2018-02-07 03:52:36 Your oil, but our coastline. What a dilemma. PLUS your premier is targeting the wrong group. BC WINE against oil lobby, Kinder Morgan, big money?  PLEASE!
9406 2018-02-07 03:52:33 #Notley Alberta Canada sub surveillance Chicoutimi. surveillance oil transfer to NK fr Russia and China Chem #tag ur bitumen?
9407 2018-02-07 03:52:33 Our economy is run by oil mongers who profit off of a limited form of energy that's really pollution. And the recent tax scam showed the lack of interest in the poor. Now, you want to go to Mars? And you want me to be exited? Thanks for micorwaves, and velcro.
9408 2018-02-07 03:52:32 Breaking: Indy Eleven still best team at Lucas Oil Stadium. Rankings 2-4:

4) Colts
9409 2018-02-07 03:52:32 Investing in an essential oil diffuser is easily the bougiest but best gift I’ve ever given myself.
9410 2018-02-07 03:52:29 Not how our Constitution works. In Canada, as we learn in high school, the technical adjudication  and dispute mechanisms of inter-provincial trade disputes lie with the courts. It’s been that way since 1982. What are you looking for? Right to transport oil clause? Not USA bud.
9411 2018-02-07 03:52:28 Wonder if they sell snake oil too. It's just as proven as Yoni Eggs right? #RecipeForDisaster
9412 2018-02-07 03:52:09 Fifteen minutes ago: Not sure how I'll eventually die, but I don't think it'll involve frozen samosas and a skillet of hot oil.
Now: Anything's possible.
9413 2018-02-07 03:51:55 Gough and the rest of the world were then tripped up by the first oil crisis- oil prices quadrupled in months sending inflation skyrocketing

9422 2018-02-07 03:50:37 #bcwine Even though I support the oil industry, Alberta does not produce such a heavenly product like B.C wine. Lol. Many Albertans go to B.C to retire and drink their wine anyways. I'll be moving to B.C myself in the next couple months. Lol. #PinotNotPipelines
9423 2018-02-07 03:50:36 I’d rather spill wine than oil, let’s all just drink a few more for BC Wine! Cheers

9425 2018-02-07 03:50:32 ... and how is that oil get to Cherry Point refinery in Washington State?  Tankers from Alaska.  I see them every day from my house in White Rock.
Let's be sensible here...
9426 2018-02-07 03:50:15 i volunteer to oil up @dannywood
9427 2018-02-07 03:50:12 Yesss. Did you do the herb oil? That really put it over the top for me. (Also I added most of the can of tomato paste.)
9428 2018-02-07 03:50:11 @liangweihan4 
rapeseed oil was renamed canola oil
for obvious reasons
9429 2018-02-07 03:50:08 Good for her! Trade works two ways or it doesn’t work at all. If only she could cut their oil cash too...  Ontario could learn something from this woman.
9430 2018-02-07 03:49:55 Would it have been different if they cheered state developed rockets? Falcon heavy probably took less than 1500 barrels of oil. The world produces 100Mn barrels a day, 34Bn a year! You're berating the kitten while the lion runs amock

9432 2018-02-07 03:49:51 The Trump government supports action against the environment and nature. It  supports the preservation of nuclear power plants, the mining of coal,  oil and natural gas and reduces and eliminates nature reserves!
9433 2018-02-07 03:49:40 Fact you use our oil, you need it to get to you. Pimples are the safest.period. You are an idiot and want to overlook your hypocrisy

9439 2018-02-07 03:48:38 Coconut oil or olive oil or both
9440 2018-02-07 03:48:22 I wonder what "Oil Can" Boyd is up to these days...
9441 2018-02-07 03:48:20 None of these pipelines are for Canadians, it's so large fossil fuel companies get rich by exporting. Nafta has a proportionality clause that says we must ship the majority of our oil to the USA. It's why Transcanada was suing USA for 15 billion after Obama said no to kxl.
9442 2018-02-07 03:48:19 Most likely won't solve a thing but I hope this puts into perspective what BC is doing to many of us oil workers #BCWine
9443 2018-02-07 03:48:09 Hand them a bottle of castor oil

9446 2018-02-07 03:47:49 If you put the pipeline along highway one it will be more eyes to see when it leaks oil ... the the highway will be maintained to make sure its safe win win
9447 2018-02-07 03:47:43 How about oil workers? they are smaller entities than small business.
9448 2018-02-07 03:47:39 assalamualaikum kak @ImanAbdulRahim. saya ada cleansing oil, cleansing water also simple facial wash gel. kalau pakai tiga tiga dikira double cleansing tak? and nak pakai mana satu dulu? tengs kak.
9449 2018-02-07 03:47:37 Albertans produce oil in an environmentally conscious manner and getting that product to market is justified and necessary.
9450 2018-02-07 03:47:29 Tillerson - I just called up Putin and said hey stop it. We will block sanctions and then both make billions of dollars when Exxon can finally help Russia drill for oil. Those pesky sanctions won't stand in our way.
9451 2018-02-07 03:47:29 Oh no! Sorry you had to deal with that. Just remember that cars these days need very little to keep chugging along. Routine maintenance (oil change, transmission fluid check, tune up) goes a VERY long way!

I also make ghee made from cultured organic butter from grassfed cows. You don't include this kind of ghee on your good oil list, why? It's the best for many reasons!
9455 2018-02-07 03:47:03 Republicans in Oklahoma used racism to gain state power during the Obama admiin. The first thing they did was cut taxes for the 1%, corporations, especially the Koch Bros, Oil & Gas. Well owners here pay 1% in tax where the next lowest state charges 7%. GOP has sold our future.
9456 2018-02-07 03:46:49 I just need a hot oil massage
9457 2018-02-07 03:46:49 I decided to try tea tree oil to spot treat acne and try to heal my nose piercing and holy fuck there's a reason the first scent description is "potent".
9458 2018-02-07 03:46:46 Egg and oldish banana in a blender, frying pan with coconut oil, prep as normal pancake. Feel free to add cinnamon in mix. Put unheated berries on it or eat as is. = proteine rich pancake. Berries and cinnamon will motivate fat burning.  Their pretty filling so 1 or 2 are plenty.
9459 2018-02-07 03:46:43 But Alberta can't allow our fellow Canadians to strangle our economy to virtue signal. Oil will be used tomorrow and the day after that.
9460 2018-02-07 03:46:30 It's nothing that dropping Fox and Friends into a vat of boiling oil couldn't fix.
9461 2018-02-07 03:46:22 Carbon neutral, actually (and thankfully) not so much. For your gratification, Tinhorn Creek was founded by the Shaugnessy family of Calgary and oil & gas. Yes indeed, the Okanagan and all of B.C. has benefitted mightily from Alberta’s energetic industriousness.

9463 2018-02-07 03:46:02 It is time our fake PM actually make a firm decision and tell BC oil is coming there way, instead of going from place to place and saying ah ah ah ah here is what you like to hear
9464 2018-02-07 03:46:02 taking an oil bath tonight. It’s needed.
9465 2018-02-07 03:46:00 Better go change your oil before your engine start loosing power and eventually lock up
9466 2018-02-07 03:45:52 My hand is covered in peppermint oil and it’s all cool and tingly, but oddly soothing.
9467 2018-02-07 03:45:51 May they can drink their oil lol 
9468 2018-02-07 03:45:51 Last 2RTs reminds me of a previous experience. In 2016, I received an oil change and service guy says “you need new air filters.  You’re breathing in toxic airs, etc.” He made it seem really bad. But, I gambled. I thought if I die, I die- No thank you.
9469 2018-02-07 03:45:45 When they say extra virgin olive oil, does that mean not even anal?
9470 2018-02-07 03:45:31 There’s nothing scarier than oil popping at you while you’re cooking
9471 2018-02-07 03:45:27 India runs on emotions first, petroleum oil next.

9474 2018-02-07 03:45:10 We DO care about the environment far more than other oil producers, like Venezuela, Saudi, Qatar, Russia, etc.
9475 2018-02-07 03:44:52 Or stop the flow of Saudi oil to the QC refineries, then an east/west pipeline will look pretty attractive
9476 2018-02-07 03:44:45 Hi sisi use organic peppermint oil. It's been proven that it helps with hair growth. Just a few drops with your coconut oil and your will grow.

9481 2018-02-07 03:43:52 Yeah oil can be annoying but damn used in the right way, don’t it ever make my body look 
9482 2018-02-07 03:43:32 i don't use a lot of solvents, which really limit me in oil paint, but i generally stick to odorless mineral spirits and solvent free gel; both of them from Gamblin. I tried to get jars and make fat and lean mixes but i don't do enough layering to make it necessary
9483 2018-02-07 03:42:58 will got me curious to know what that coconut oil do tho
9484 2018-02-07 03:42:51 Uhh... This is, like, an oil field, right? Should we really be tossing explosives around?

9495 2018-02-07 03:41:22 Most of our gas in Vancouver comes from US sources. Your pipeline oil is for export only. BC takes nothing but risk in shipping from here. No upside for BC. Alberta can't even clean up it's own oil mess. Who will clean up Vancouver?

9498 2018-02-07 03:40:49 so disappointed in you. How would you like an oil spill happen in your neighborhood like the one in Burnaby?
9499 2018-02-07 03:40:46 Hi! What do u think abt the TO Squalane Oil?
9500 2018-02-07 03:40:45 Law of the Seas may only addresses part of the offshore oil drilling concern. OOD impact on our coastal communities concern US but...
9501 2018-02-07 03:40:33 It certainly is a political FUBAR at his point. The unfortunate truth is that huge oil prices created loads of jobs in Alberta and the belief they would stay. Gov squandered time for diversification & we can't get it back.
9502 2018-02-07 03:40:19 Yes and it does a great job. Food taste good no oil.
9503 2018-02-07 03:40:13 油揚げって言うほど油って感じしなくない？ほんとに騙された気分だよ。
9504 2018-02-07 03:40:08 so you prefer Saudi oil over Canadian. It shouldn’t even be a question.
9505 2018-02-07 03:40:05 When the price of oil was high Alberta was awash in money. Labourers in the oil patch were making 170k and Alberta partied. Now the price has dropped and the province has nothing leftover but a hangover the expectation is that BC eat this pipline. At a 1.36$ a litre they can fkof
9506 2018-02-07 03:40:03 All I need in this life of sin is a good essential oil blend
9507 2018-02-07 03:39:58 Cute. By comparison blocking an approved oil pipeline supported by 100% of First Nations along the route is costing us $1,000,000,000 every ten days. Get to drinking I suppose. Your work is cut out for you.
9508 2018-02-07 03:39:50 i just want to find some honey oil that taste like maple syrup omg... i would never smoke anything else
9509 2018-02-07 03:39:48 Right? But please can we not have oil pipelines through our nature? Tyvm
9510 2018-02-07 03:39:43 Yes we do need to ban oil by rail, I drive by where the lac megantic trains were supposed to end up everyday, I want better transit and more electric cars
9511 2018-02-07 03:39:42 Yeah, insanity: Canadian Oil companies have more support for Carbon taxes and Emissions Caps implemented by an NDP Government than do UCP and CPC.

In reality, it is because it makes business sense for them.
9512 2018-02-07 03:39:31 #bcwine
all you bc winers can walk to the Okanagan. get your wine no use of a cell phone or sippy cup made from oil while I drive to the store using gas, diesel to get my out of BC wine while using my cell phone to order online which is delivered by a gas using vehicle!! Yup
9513 2018-02-07 03:39:21 You got nice skin. Coconut oil based moisturizers?
9514 2018-02-07 03:39:08 Fixable.
Give me a break. Humans invented the damn thing. To burn peanut oil. The fact that nobody ever had to solve bio waxing because petroleum was so cheap and prevalent is exactly no real limit. It's a talking point.
9515 2018-02-07 03:39:06 I really cannot speak for the blasphemous sundried and oil infused members of the tomato family though. They clearly have gone astray.
9516 2018-02-07 03:39:02 #forex Crude Oil Prices Ignore Upbeat News as EIA Sees US Output Surge: Crude oil prices shrugged off supportive API inventory data and didn’t participate in a market-wide risk appetite recovery as the EIA projected a rapid pickup in US output growth. #forexsignals
9517 2018-02-07 03:39:02 That’s all we have to counter with over oil sanctions....wine?
9518 2018-02-07 03:38:56 ... No selling your products in the lobby... Cds, Tapes Blessed Oil...too much ..lol #EdwinHawkins #Homegoing
9519 2018-02-07 03:38:49 @kevintaftab Ph.D. Business has recently released "Oil's Deep State: How the petroleum industry undermines democracy and stops action on global warming - in Alberta and in Ottawa" . A succinct and factually supported analysis. Disturbing 
9520 2018-02-07 03:38:44 It's not brittle... it literally melds with the oil in your skin.

Foil leaf gilding on picture frames is applied to very lightly oiled wood and built up layer by later.
9521 2018-02-07 03:38:42 Jamie Dixon needs to get the oil changed in his
9522 2018-02-07 03:38:28 This narrative is so brainwashed its unbelievable. It is greener. More efficent and lowers our cost of living. Makes the country profit which lowers taxes. Its common sense. Instead people would rather buy dirty oil and pretend they are helping. Sorry....just making it worse.
9523 2018-02-07 03:38:25 Break out the oil. Speedo club on the prowl #meow
9524 2018-02-07 03:38:21 Coconut oil on from head to toe on newly shaved skin feels amazing 
9525 2018-02-07 03:38:12 Why do you keep saying “our key export”? CONs made damn sure no Albertan ever owned our energy resources thanks to the CON sell of off public assets. No foreign owned multinational oil company flies the Canadian flag.
9526 2018-02-07 03:38:09 These are Canadian, primarily Calgary-based, companies you are talking about. These are the companies whose heads were up on stage with Notley while she announced our Carbon Tax and the Emissions Cap on Oil Sands production.
9527 2018-02-07 03:38:06 also like, throwing bc farmers under the bus to cape for oil when it won’t win you conservative votes anyways!

9529 2018-02-07 03:38:00 Why stop it? Make a good argument. And don't give the usual blah blah blah that we need to get off oil. Wake up. Want it to travel by rail?
9530 2018-02-07 03:37:58 Especially the smelly oil part XD
9531 2018-02-07 03:37:56 My phone dryer than my hair before i re-upped on oil today
9532 2018-02-07 03:37:50 ya bra bra. Coconut oil. Tell shawty to melt it down before ya get there.
9533 2018-02-07 03:37:45 There are other kinds of oil in Canada than dilbit.  Saskatchewan, Alberta and even BC have it.  I don't care for the Saudis' sweet oil, but it takes less refining than tar sand oil.
9534 2018-02-07 03:37:40 Space rockets use oil. Wtf do we think we're doing, other than making oil companies $?
9535 2018-02-07 03:37:38 You need to educate yourself on the environmental impact of no pipeline. BC still needs the oil to come in but will be via more dangerous methods.

9537 2018-02-07 03:37:34 Living off greens multivitamins, thieves cough drops and breathe again oil all over my body. This allergy thing is for the birds
9538 2018-02-07 03:37:21 Fact is, we do need oil here in North America. Exporting bitumen to China means less jobs in Alberta and less oil products for North Americans. And pipelines create massive risk to BC rivers and coastline. All to send bitumen to China.
9539 2018-02-07 03:37:20 Oil Caps fall to the Steelers by a score of 6-3. Game recap to come.
9540 2018-02-07 03:36:55 My friend’s twenty year old Mercedes Has been converted from gas to biofuel....his exhaust smells like french  fries now, as he now fills his tank with used cooking oil from restaurants
9541 2018-02-07 03:36:53 So I woke up from a nap & I looked at my nose & it was shiny & I was like “DAMN GIRL THAT HIGHLIGHT” but then I remember I didn’t put any and that was just the oil from my nose lmfao
9542 2018-02-07 03:36:47 It's good, but idk how well it'll go for me in the summer because I'm an oil bucket of a person. But right now, it's great
9543 2018-02-07 03:36:47 Three slash four cup vegetable oil.
9544 2018-02-07 03:36:39 Suggestions if u choose 2 try them-A.)take 81 mg baby aspirin daily(if yr not allergc/not contraindicatd w/other meds) B.) take 1200 mg fish oil daily. C) Next time u get SVT/HR greater than 120 BPM put yr face in a bowl of icewater;this can slow HR via a sorta vasovagal maneuvr
9545 2018-02-07 03:36:26 By the way....Canada is a carbon negative nation. We actually are cleaning everyone elses pollution with our vast forests but use their dirty oil instead of using our own. We have top regulations. The alternative is buying oil with no regulations on how its taken.
9546 2018-02-07 03:36:23 #bcwinewell all you bc winers can walk to the Okanagan. get your wine no use of a cell phone or sippy cup made from oil while I drive to the store using gas, diesel to get my out of BC wine while using my cell phone to order online which is delivered by a gas using vehicle!! Yup
9547 2018-02-07 03:36:20 This is all political theatre, Rachel Notley has always hated big oil and pipelines, it’s ironic that she is trying to fright something she despises.  She worked with the premier of BC and she campaigned for them.  So how is this a shock.  Theatrical politics.
9548 2018-02-07 03:36:04 Oh goodness haha thank you! (Only eyeliner, lipgloss and eyebrow pencil here, that shine on my cheeks is natural oil/sweat )
9549 2018-02-07 03:35:59 Jojoba oil and rosehip seed oil changed my life. Seriously
9550 2018-02-07 03:35:50 "One ironic twist of a pipeline shutdown is that B.C. would bring in their fuel with more barges in the Salish Sea, more oil trains on tracks, more oil trucks on highways. All methods are more precarious than a pipeline a pipeline-free B.C. would start experiencing more spills."
9551 2018-02-07 03:35:38 I tried making french fries and mu ass dropped hot a oil on my foot im gonna cry WTTTFFFF
9552 2018-02-07 03:35:34 This has no bearing on whether our rights are being trampled today. There was an agreement B.C wanted the impact assessed and it was assessed. Alberta met its burden, B.C reneged. Pipelines are the safest way to move oil, every other method has more risk to the environment.
9553 2018-02-07 03:35:25 If only the big banks, big oil, some major car manufacturers, DOD contracts, corn farmers...oh wait...it's a trend to fuel big business!
9554 2018-02-07 03:35:14 Oh the one tim got do miracles . its not the oil you got

9557 2018-02-07 03:34:44 Voy a recalcar una frase muy conocida. QUE NADIE SE EQUIVOQUE el próximo P. R.  ya no es un peligro. Ya los mexicanos no nos vamos a espantar por todo lo que inventen. Ya estamos curados de espanto con tanta delincuencia y con los precios altos de CFE, GAS OIL y pobres ya somos.
9558 2018-02-07 03:34:36 there is also lots of foreign dictator oil flowing to Canada. That’s okay though right.
9559 2018-02-07 03:34:08 Good point & I agree that its a larger regional issue but only speaking of my own experiences living & working in Thaialnd for last 20 years. I've seen that snake oil shit for sale at the impulse checkout line at Tops supermarket in Bang Krabue ffs 
9560 2018-02-07 03:34:04 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!

9567 2018-02-07 03:33:35 Lmao I sorry biffy you did damn near everything already.. you tried pineapples? Castor oil??
9568 2018-02-07 03:33:34 The amount of stupid coming from you is amazing. No one in canada gets "vehicle fuel" from AB and their bitumen, and they probably could get by without any oil based fuels if necessary. Ever heard of biofuel? Never heard of electric vehicles either I guess?

9572 2018-02-07 03:32:58 @Pastel_Oil
9573 2018-02-07 03:32:54 Again, 'bleat'.  Perhaps Alberta should diversify its economy instead of putting its financial eggs in the oil basket.  Dilbit is getting harder to sell because more and more places don't want it.  Adapt.
9574 2018-02-07 03:32:45 I usually do it when the oil was lacked.
9575 2018-02-07 03:32:32 You people in Ottawa have to pick up on the @FairQuestions story behind the foreign anti-Canadian oil lobby-follow the money. @stephenharper touched on it in 2015 but didn't push it hard enough.
9576 2018-02-07 03:32:30 赤いバラで種が交換できるようになって、肥料も大量にもらえたので花を育てるのは楽になったが・・・はりついてないときびしい〜
9577 2018-02-07 03:32:17 we as BC don't want all the risk while AB gets all the reward - pls look at Kinder Morgan - they are a horrible Corp Citizen (google Kalamazoo oil spill) - can't risk it #bcwine #PinotNotPipelines
9578 2018-02-07 03:32:14 Just read an article referencing a politician’s fight against ‘toxic pet coke,’ and felt relieved when a frantic google search revealed it’s only a terrible byproduct of oil refining, and not the new party drug for labradoodles.
9579 2018-02-07 03:32:10 Sure. But there's no political will to do that. The oil companies are determined to extract as much as they can, as fast as they can. You're too smart to believe they care about AB, its economy, its future, or its people.
9580 2018-02-07 03:31:59 that’s not Lucas Oil Stadium

9584 2018-02-07 03:31:27 So I made slime a few weeks ago and it was starting to smell gross so I added lavender oil to it and now my room is overpoweringly lavender scented
9585 2018-02-07 03:31:23 Remember to also get some brushes to apply it with. It will vanish into the oil of your skin if you try to pick it up.
9586 2018-02-07 03:31:14 The sounds around me: slight hum of the oil diffuser, one cat licking herself, and the other cat snoring. It all seems super loud when I’m alone. 
9587 2018-02-07 03:31:13 Vitamin E oil is not natural! It is usually processed from soybean oil. Nature does not make Vitamin E oil.
9588 2018-02-07 03:31:12 Hey McDonald’s, is it true, if you eat the french fries you won’t lose your hair?Heard on the news that your French fries have some kind of oil that prevents hair loss.
9589 2018-02-07 03:31:09 To all the politicians, donors, but don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.

9593 2018-02-07 03:30:31 They can't move as much oil by rail as they can by pipeline so no, pipelines still increase the risk of a spill in water by increasing the number of shipments.

9603 2018-02-07 03:29:50 Hey, I want Alberta to diversify its economy more than most people. I'm not exactly a massive fan of the Oil patch here.
But I also know we can diversify without money, and the best way for Alberta to get that is to export oil to Non-US/Canada clients.
9604 2018-02-07 03:29:46 Take two table spoons if Extra Virgin Olive Oil every day. California Ranch "Everyday" EVOO. Also, take lots of fish oil. Nordic Naturals. Be sure it's Ultimate Omega high in EPA and DHA.

9614 2018-02-07 03:27:51 It’s basically marijuana concentrate in the form of an oil.

9618 2018-02-07 03:27:21 @CindyMorgan_ Cindy Morgan (Lacy Underall) has said that the oil massage scene with Chevy Chase was also completely improvised. When Lacy exclaims "You're crazy!" that was Morgan's genuine reaction to Chase dousing her with oil. Is this true?
9619 2018-02-07 03:27:07 Oh I get it. You think because we use oil that we must triple the speed in which we dig it up and transport it through our province. No thanks.

9633 2018-02-07 03:24:08 Plus I ain’t changing no oil save that for the mechanics
9634 2018-02-07 03:23:49 boy im not using nothing but my spit on the dick. coconut oil gone make ya dick smell like baked chicken.
9635 2018-02-07 03:23:44 Is there a way to get more oil?
9636 2018-02-07 03:23:43 Sounds like @RachelNotley is becoming a northern style #Trump. "Oh yea!! my Dad can beat up your Dad". Wine and oil don't mix. Buy #bcwine
9637 2018-02-07 03:23:32 Almost bought a new car today, decided to wait. Got oil change on old cars and tash had a nail in her tire and mine needed to be replaced. Fuck me
9638 2018-02-07 03:23:21 All the money and resources being used to defend illegal aliens applied to Vets would be a nice gesture
9639 2018-02-07 03:23:18 Hopefully they'll remind him the corrupt architect of global warming, oil tycoon Maurice Strong, is no longer with us. The only news I want on a Clinton is a prison cell number.
9640 2018-02-07 03:23:17 ... which is why this expansion, instead of a new pipeline, makes the most sense - existing route, meeting existing (growing) demand. Like I said - this oil is already being sold for half-price. Why not get closer-to-full price for it?

9643 2018-02-07 03:22:47 I find the Oil marketing sector a business and see in no way that it should be a charity.Tell me do you want Govt. entities to run like Air India and beg the state money every time or do you want them to make cash and run like well oiled clock- your take. :/
9644 2018-02-07 03:22:44 Perhaps as soon as now??? We’ve heard of the term oil this past year.
9645 2018-02-07 03:22:41 Lavander essential oil in the diffuser kind of night 
9646 2018-02-07 03:22:16 Listen. I’ve been oil cleansing, oil pulling, drinking tea and buying stones all because of Fran. My 30s have CHANGED because of her
9647 2018-02-07 03:22:09 Nothing about rnc and Steve Wynn? You lead tainted snake oil sales man and performance artist?
9648 2018-02-07 03:22:02 Sube el dólar, suben los precios. Suben los combustibles (gas oil y naftas) suben los precios. ¿Cómo hacer para que la inflación no sea de dos dígitos largos a fines de 2018?
9649 2018-02-07 03:21:54 British Columbians are willing to drink Alberta's share of #BCWine in order to keep #dilbit and #Alberta heavy #oil out of the province and to #stopKM
9650 2018-02-07 03:21:45 If you need your lashes to grow I 10/ 10 would recommend castor oil
9651 2018-02-07 03:21:42 I’m sure there is some essential oil that will cure not only the stomach bug but balance out your aura.
9652 2018-02-07 03:21:35 @NadiaAndKaye wondering ..did the cannabis oil work ?  #fellowinsomniac  x
9653 2018-02-07 03:21:33 There's an essential oil for that

9655 2018-02-07 03:21:20 Finally, if you are an oil (or oil shipping) company, why would you want to lose valuable product? It's in the financial interests of them not to have spills.
9656 2018-02-07 03:20:59 Also... cherry coke works just as well as regular coke against skunk oil #TipOfTheDay 
9657 2018-02-07 03:20:55 No Peony oil just the CC, RTM & UNIBT & EDP.
9658 2018-02-07 03:20:44 How do people like Sorkin (and Robert Sameulson) have jobs, and get followers? They're like economic snake oil salesman. (PS- now is the time to invest in snake oil futures!)
9659 2018-02-07 03:20:38 @chrissyteigen any tips for keeping food from sticking to a cast iron pan during cooking? I’ve seasoned it really well, always heat my oil before adding my food, and rub in oil to recoat the surface after using it. But food still sticks in the very center! Hhhnnnggg 
9660 2018-02-07 03:20:29 I understand the importance of getting our oil to coastal waters but kicking your neighbors dog doesn't usually help solve problems.
9661 2018-02-07 03:20:24 A great idea! We'll keep BC wine and Alberta will keep their heavy oil! Fair Trade!
9662 2018-02-07 03:20:21 Does anybody else remember the Disney Channel short (it was like a TTI or friends for change thing) where the girl painted pictures of animals to raise money for the oil spill and was “flabbergasted”
9663 2018-02-07 03:20:04 ok literally i shouldn’t have wasted my time doin fuckin 10 minutes salt soaks and vitamin e oil massages and shit fr fr if your stretched ears get infected:
9664 2018-02-07 03:19:56 Hey Alberta ship your oil east. Would love to have some work here in Atlantic Canada. Oh wait the Federal Government couldn’t get that pipeline going either.
9665 2018-02-07 03:19:55 Can’t wait to see the truck on the track
9666 2018-02-07 03:19:54 It hits home..you can’t bleed about oil and pipelines (which is the safest way to transport) while you use the very product you are bitching about.
9667 2018-02-07 03:19:32 オイルだって怒るんだぞ怒ったら引火してギトギトのボーボーにしてやるからな
9668 2018-02-07 03:19:31 Ah, so that is the new narrative. Harper didn’t get Alberta oil to tide water because he was avoiding inter provincial trade wars. Great spin #cdnpoli #ableg #bcpoli
9669 2018-02-07 03:19:24 Yes, it will take time. Problem is, AB is stuck in the past. At its pace, we'll never advance.

I understand that rail and trucking are poor ways to move oil. But those accidents are harder to ignore than remote pipeline leaks. Oil companies have acted in bad faith long enough.
9670 2018-02-07 03:19:18 wait a second. if I move to northern europe, olive oil is going to be so fucking expensive. fuck
9671 2018-02-07 03:19:13 Clove oil for tooth pain tho??

9677 2018-02-07 03:18:32 Everyone could have a chunk if Quebec wasn't a bunch of scabs. They would rather ship oil over from North Sea and middle east then use Canadian oil! Who does that support? Canada needs access to both tide waters. But No, I would rather support the middle east!

9684 2018-02-07 03:18:14 While I agree with your assessment of Rachel , Boeing 737’s do require a shit load of crude oil based Jet A .
9685 2018-02-07 03:18:13 I used too much coconut oil again, but this time I figured I’d rub the excess on my feet & now I need a new pair of Benassi Slides. 

Coconut oil is ruining my life. 
9686 2018-02-07 03:18:08 wow it really is true what the reviews say; argan oil smells like garbage.

9696 2018-02-07 03:17:06 What if BC let Alberta build a pipeline to ship oil, and we let BC build a pipeline to ship wine!? #WinWin
9697 2018-02-07 03:17:00 Hardly a PR stunt. If you lived in a coastal state you wouldn't want someone coming in and telling you, you HAVE to put a drilling operation there.  It hurts tourism and fishing industries.  Also, oil is in a glut now, drilling more helps no one.
9698 2018-02-07 03:16:58 Deion Jones and Michael Thomas. Imagine Deion Jones next to Mosely that's a scary LB tandem. Or having a WR that catches the ball and doesn't have beachballs covered in baby oil for hands.
9699 2018-02-07 03:16:58 We know the truth today; classified info found in Beograde archives show how regime change in Iran was orchestrated to start large scale war in the Middle-east. Aim? To move control of all oil producing countries in hands the western oligarchs.
9700 2018-02-07 03:16:56 @InsideEdition Maybe you should have reported how Doritos are made by mowing down the rainforests to plant palm oil farms. #ClimateAction
9701 2018-02-07 03:16:53 CBD oil, legal in all 50, different strengths, "travelers" type is for those that must pass drug tests, vaping is better for instant relief, drops under you tongue will also work. It is also great for nausea. Good luck!!

9707 2018-02-07 03:16:30 Evaporates by itself when you turn it off, so I do 2 cups of rice, 3 1/2cups of water, Brown the rice with oil first then when the rice is brown, add half the can of tomato sauce, and ASS the water and the boulion or whatever seasoning lol and hen I always always do medui low-
9708 2018-02-07 03:16:29 I need my brows done, my nails and toes done, my oil changed and I’m brokeee 
9709 2018-02-07 03:16:23 But they sound nice Dave, doesn't that count for something? Evening Primrose Oil, Starflower Oil, Swallow's Flight Oil, Gossamer Silk Oil, Dead Hyena Oil (OK , I made some of those up)
9710 2018-02-07 03:16:15 Well if no pipeline is apporved it is moved by rail. What dont you guys get? One way or another the oil will be moved. Pipeline is the safest and greenest way to do so. Trains derail all the time. Wake up.

9728 2018-02-07 03:14:20 Their marula oil is overpriced and the hydra gel is crap, but I like everything else I’ve tried. I’ve tried everything except the baby facial mask & the new protini moisturizer which I will probably buy when I’m done w/ this hydra gel crap
9729 2018-02-07 03:14:14 I only ask one single simple question! Are "you" willing to live without oil and all of its derivatives?  Don't need to hear all of your talk. A simple yes or no?
9730 2018-02-07 03:14:12 Hardware upgrade. Lol.  I like that. ..I hope you have your oil can, because that hardware get stiff. I know from experience
9731 2018-02-07 03:14:00 Keep your dirty oil in your own damn province. Bc is sick of literally cleaning up after you. Just last week there was another spill outside Vancouver. This pipeline will increase tanker traffic by 700%!
9732 2018-02-07 03:13:53 Bloomberg needs to do a better job of researching this topic.

9773 2018-02-07 03:10:15 Don't you mean Notley's trade spat? BC isn't boycotting any products from Alberta. She's a bully who's actions are hurting small BC businesses for the interest of a foreign oil company. Facts matter.
9774 2018-02-07 03:09:55 i'll rather shove my left foot into a mcdonald's oil vat
9775 2018-02-07 03:09:52 There was no more oil in the house, nor were there any candles.（家にはもう油がなく、ろうそくもありませんでした。）
9776 2018-02-07 03:09:44 She cashed the cheques from oil.

9779 2018-02-07 03:09:08 Putting lavender + peppermint in my oil diffuser was my best idea all year
9780 2018-02-07 03:09:07 When people stop being consumers of oil then they have a right to criticize it...otherwise they are just hypocrites who huff and puff and can’t be taken seriously
9781 2018-02-07 03:09:00 On behalf of my regiment of musket bearers, we understand your deflated feelings.  But General Kraft thanks you for playing his game, and wishes to convey his wish for your general to be boiled in motor oil, preferably the Lucas brand.
9782 2018-02-07 03:08:58 Still using tea tree oil on my beard
9783 2018-02-07 03:08:46 well hey,I think it was an awful mistake to allow more oil tankers in our waters but a decision had to be made &my PM made it.
9784 2018-02-07 03:08:41 Vitamin E oil is working wonderrrrrs for my skin
9785 2018-02-07 03:08:39 Y’all gotta stop thinking coconut & olive oil is the holy grail  one is highly comedogenic and the other is drying af. Use essential oils...
9786 2018-02-07 03:08:32 He's an idiot, and she's a fraud.. When do we get the good candidates, with actual debates, intellectual conversations and talk about the issues.. instead of: Birth Certificates, Taxes, Emails, Daddy's Oil Money.. Such a Farce :(
9787 2018-02-07 03:07:55 miners and oil stocks crushed while the commodity it follows was stable. Big shake out?
9788 2018-02-07 03:07:44 Google areas already reclaimed. It’s impressive.  Every angry Hollywood type shown the great reclamation work oil sands companies have already done, come away with a new attitude. The land already has oil seeping up naturally, poisoning everything.  It’s not pristine parkland.
9789 2018-02-07 03:07:41 The sickest thing about the Trump Administration is the way it acts as if poor people are depraved, thieving monsters unworthy of a drop of human trust, unlike big banks and oil companies.
9790 2018-02-07 03:07:40 Guys I got tree tea oil today and cant wait to try it on my acne. @CrazyForChicago thanks for telling me about it.
9791 2018-02-07 03:07:36 #bcwineboycott I’m an alberta wine lover.  I’m also an oil rig worker.  My family depends on my line of work as I’m sure your family depends on yours. Your gov attack on my industry sucks. And I’m sure the opposite is true to you. Sucks doesn’t it.
9792 2018-02-07 03:07:30 He and I use the same brand of coconut oil ..... we are mallu brothers from different mothers. He has too much of hair so the oil's efficacy is a bit diminished.
9793 2018-02-07 03:07:29   of course you have, says it all really, had you ever heard of them before the oil money came?

9799 2018-02-07 03:06:41 Expanding this pipeline and transitioning away from oil are not exclusive - in fact, I'd argue one helps with the other.

Also - Norway.

9802 2018-02-07 03:06:29 You'd prefer this shipped by rail? Or by Truck? There's a much greater chance of an accident with those methods, and it costs more in terms of emissions and money to move oil that way.

If it isn't getting shipped by pipeline i will get shipped by a worse method.

9810 2018-02-07 03:05:51 Saying Lucas Oil is better than Soldier Field is crazy and makes everything you’ve ever said invalid
9811 2018-02-07 03:05:46 @jjhorgan @RachelNotley BC/Alberta "trade war?" Pure political theatre that benefits two fragile NDP Governments. Not sure whether to be impressed or depressed. I do know Alberta needs oil more than it should & BC needs clean coasts & waters more than oil pipelines or wine sales.
9812 2018-02-07 03:05:39 I like candles! But I don't have anywhere to really put them...I DO have lavender essential oil though! Maybe I'll spritz some on my pillow tonight and see if it helps. I've considering getting a essential oil humidifier but again-i don't really have space. ;~;
9813 2018-02-07 03:05:38 you need BC to get your oil to the Asian markets, the BC native bands with the backing of our provincial government will tie this up in the courts forever as Vancouver locals will never allow this. We have the ocean. We don’t need anything from Alberta . #Cascadia #cdnpoli

9817 2018-02-07 03:05:11 Moment, Modi started frying pakoras, @sardesairajdeep went out on streets to pour hot oil on himself.
9818 2018-02-07 03:05:08 How you gonna have thick thighs AND a thigh gap?! Is it the tea tree oil? The cramping cream?! #damn
9819 2018-02-07 03:05:05 It is a fact that there are more derailments than pipeline bursts. But when a pipeline bursts, the amount of oil/fuel spewing out is far greater than a few rail cars.
9820 2018-02-07 03:04:41 I couldn’t wait to put this oil in my dry ass head 
9821 2018-02-07 03:04:40 And just in case someone comes in to wiseass: when you say that, and I agree, doesn't mean this cancer curing snake oil selling doesn't happen elsewhere, it happens and its bad. But somehow here there is no tools to combat false advertising?
9822 2018-02-07 03:04:29 Thank Cope! I agree - #liveinrents, #househacking, & #liveinflips are all amazing tools. I love the "small oil well" comparison. So true!
9823 2018-02-07 03:04:29 #DidYouKnow  J. M. W. Turner depicted the fishermen of #Shoeburyness in his oil painting Shoeburyness Fishermen Hailing a Whitstable Hoy.
9824 2018-02-07 03:04:26 That would be good; I've not cooked a lot with fennel but like it.  I do use olive oil a lot.  obtw, good use of the word 'tripe.'  .......... about the only food that I just won't/can't eat!
9825 2018-02-07 03:04:23 Another reason I am glad to be leaving Alberta (though to be fair I'm not fond of Wynne either, and I feel sore for voting for her): Albert premier boycotts #bcwine because BC is blocking an oil pipeline. I am...unsure how these two industries relate?
9826 2018-02-07 03:04:20 If the oil companies want to spend billions of their money on a useless pipeline then go for it. If oil is so dead then take their billions
9827 2018-02-07 03:04:20 Tx for everything this season. If you’d have told me 9 months ago we’d be debating the 15 plays that led to the Super Bowl, Id’ve called u crazy. Now let’s throw this giant ball of oil out the window
9828 2018-02-07 03:04:07 Most billionaires get some kind of subsidy, oil barons get subsidies, bezos is making a ton of money from the CIA for some reason.
9829 2018-02-07 03:04:01 Are you 5 ? Grow up, you are setting a ridiculous example not Canadian. Look what oil has done to the beauty of Alberta. Now you want to destroy the beauty of British Columbia. How about bring back Alberta farms. So sad.
9830 2018-02-07 03:03:51 Well, I'd gladly ship our Oil there but without Energy East there's not enough pipeline capacity to ship it to any ports on the Atlantic, let alone have Quebec using Canadian oil rather that US or Overseas imports.
9831 2018-02-07 03:03:35 LOVING VINCENT So exquisite! The amount of work put into each frame of oil painting blows my head clear off . Highly recommend.
9832 2018-02-07 03:03:33 Here we go ! Oil vs Wine ..
9833 2018-02-07 03:03:17 If the oil was to stay in Vancouver, then I could be convinced to increase throughput on the pipeline.  But, in no way, should we endanger our coast for the sake of profits.  Risking killing off the orca population, devastating salmon runs, sea otters... NO
9834 2018-02-07 03:03:03 You support big oil and the massive tailings that are too expensive to clean up, and with the price of oil being so low, it makes no economic sense to even try. Look at all that damage and give yerself a big pat on the back.

9843 2018-02-07 03:02:04 Think about BC as well. First maintain our Province free of pollution, oil spills and ships killing the Orcas. It is easy to say “ think of Alberta” you are creating a war.

9847 2018-02-07 03:01:30 What snake oil is being peddled? His message is: competent hard working people rise to the top, and if you don't fall into one of those two categories then clean your act up instead of tearing down the system. He's quite fair if you actually listen to him
9848 2018-02-07 03:01:29 No, but he did post the oil of magnitude one....he puts the lotion of magnitude  on his skin so he doesn't get the inertia acceleration again.
9849 2018-02-07 03:01:29 At night I apply pure retinal around my eye area, cheeks, and forehead. Retinal is pure vitamin A and it is serious anti aging properties.

9850 2018-02-07 03:01:26 Just discovered coconut oil 
9851 2018-02-07 03:01:16 Glad the government is getting involved. What about windshield washer fluid? Engine oil comes in pretty bottles too. When will it end?
9852 2018-02-07 03:00:48 Really?

If you're such a big oil investor you'd care very much whether they sign a deal, and if you enjoy making money you'd care about unions.

If you care about fiscal policy/social safety nets you'd care about NGOs.

You pretend to care, but show your lack of knowledge / care

9858 2018-02-07 03:00:20 And you already have pipelines, and oil tankers on your coastline. Are you making the same demands of those?
9859 2018-02-07 02:59:54 I didn’t know Putin wanted us to be oil independent, low unemployment,  stock market up, low taxes and repatriate our money! Thanks Putin!
9860 2018-02-07 02:59:45 Fix what’s fixable instead of moving on. Something as simple as oil can fuck the whole car up. Something as communication can fuck a relationship up. Add the oil when needed, or communicate when there’s need for communication. Warning signs don’t matter when you neglect them.
9861 2018-02-07 02:59:44 In one serving cabbage went from being as popular as tripe to being a favourite vegetable.

When preparing meals for my own brood I even took to using olive oil instead of butter and also found that cooking cabbage and fennel together worked well.
9862 2018-02-07 02:59:36 Better idea! How about we make pipelines, but instead of filling them with Alberta oil, we fill them with BC wine and reverse the flow? Talk about a solution that makes everyone happy!!:))

9864 2018-02-07 02:59:24 210k gallons of oil is nothing. That's 5000 barrels. It might seem likely a lot until you realise 96 million barrels are transported worldwide every day. No human activity is 100% safe. Industry is an exercise in risk management.

9876 2018-02-07 02:58:06 my hair has never been this dry so maybe it’s because i used oil & knowing my hair doesn’t like it

9880 2018-02-07 02:57:50 Senator Manning: There is no question that expansion will result in safer, more efficient shipment of oil between AB and BC. The oil industry has to be developed and we have to work side by side with industry to ensure that it is. /18

9892 2018-02-07 02:56:28 need to invest in (more) coconut oil, (more) ACV, aloe vera, raw shea butter, essential oils and a diffuser 
9893 2018-02-07 02:56:21 Not sure that Notley could tell an Albertan company not to send oil by pipeline to BC for domestic consumption. That would be as unconstitutional as what BC is trying to do.
9894 2018-02-07 02:56:12 It's the off radar stuff they do while we're staring @ (The Crazy) that I look at: Nix of Equifax Investgn, Natl Park Grabs (Oil/Nat Gas), Defund'n Legal Assistnc-Food Programs Kids/Elderly-Educatn etc/Mueller will do it-but When? What's left to work with? I worry about that.

9897 2018-02-07 02:55:55 I haven’t been this numb on a team since Gillispie. I honestly don’t care if it is coachspeak. If it is, good luck selling that snake oil. If not, I’m more pissed at him than I am right now.
9898 2018-02-07 02:55:55 I agree with punishing the BC gov't but I'm skeptical about taking it out on the wineries. If there's a conservative voter in BC, it's in the interior. Rather see AB turn the oil off. BC claims they don't want oil, shut it down.
9899 2018-02-07 02:55:51 Lol @ some of y'all always bragging about being moisturized and you look a full 5yrs older than you are. Coconut oil don't fix ugly. And then some of y'all don't know balance and you look greasy. On top of ugly

9901 2018-02-07 02:55:37 the woman at the Zen Zest shop got a little carried away. her freebie oil for me to compensate for my 60 pesos discrepancy is well worth over 500 pesos

Yes! A big oil rig! But it has to spew oil out the back.
9905 2018-02-07 02:55:02 I don't understand how some Canadians think. We are rich in resources, yet we are willing to pay billions yearly to receive oil from terrorist countries making them rich. They pollute our oceans with tankers, yet we are basically pollution free in this country compared to others.
9906 2018-02-07 02:54:55 I wonder if it works better than snake oil?

9908 2018-02-07 02:54:42 The bike Chain is now Broke no need to get the oil.but find the missing link to the Chain.Lebron I'll say this you have to make sure you Make sure you make the right move to either stay or go But some things you need to consider.1 is your Oaths.2 The Will of direction @KingJames
9909 2018-02-07 02:54:41 oh,,, and i forgot,,,palm oil may be edible but is transfat and unhealthy for the body,,,,for sure YOU do not eat it,,,plus it has a lot of karma,,,,you have blood on your hands

9911 2018-02-07 02:54:23 I never said anything about the oil. I'm talking about the incompetent woman that is making a huge mistake in her choice plan. There are other ways to do business not attack the small business winery's of Canada.
9912 2018-02-07 02:54:20 I keep putting too much oil in my new aromatherapy diffuser...I’m getting high off the fumes...lavender and tea tree trip 
9913 2018-02-07 02:54:02 SCORE UPDATE: Oil Caps are in tough tonight in Selkirk. Virden down 6-2 after 40 mins. Kirkup with his 32nd goal of the year in second period.
9914 2018-02-07 02:54:00 おつありっぽい？
9915 2018-02-07 02:53:57 May want to do your research. LA Seismic has permits to do the testing for Oil and Gas exploration surveys, not earthquake testing.
9916 2018-02-07 02:53:47 And to the original point of this argument there is no way in hell that international law allows one nation to run a oil pipeline over another sovereign nation. Absolutely. No. Way.
9917 2018-02-07 02:53:44 Lately I’ve either been bunning it or leaving my twists in. If I wanna wear a wig I braid my twists down. I mist my hair every other day with water and follow up with almond or grapeseed oil.
9918 2018-02-07 02:53:34 NYC is suing various oil companies for lying about climate change. Good for them.
9919 2018-02-07 02:53:34 You have to assume coal/gas/oil are finished in the near term - it's more surprising they're still hanging in there.

But look at the alliance between Russia & China. What's the one massive investment China can make in its economy that still makes sense? Renewables/conservation.
9920 2018-02-07 02:53:25 They act like the dirty oil that gets harder to produce or even sell is funding the whole damned country.  They forget how subsidized their industry is.
9921 2018-02-07 02:53:23 So say “Yes” to Coconut Oil;
“No” to red meat na overcooked

Andaming sacrifices. 
9922 2018-02-07 02:53:08 What do you use apricot oil for ?
9923 2018-02-07 02:52:55 You can think about it when you fill up your car with gas after you change your oil and drive home on asphalt
9924 2018-02-07 02:52:49 @annmcc123 maybe she’s trying to defend the thousands of Alberta families who depend on the oil industry for a living
9925 2018-02-07 02:52:44 Just on a new car you have plates, insurance, taxes, registration, gas, oil, parts, air freshners, car wash (time or money).... Like 8k right there, low.... 15k-20k high....

9931 2018-02-07 02:52:13 True. We saw this in AB during the boom years when many workers could command incredibly high salaries. With this came overpriced housing and very expensive/congested infrastructure. Even if oil prices had not crashed, it was not sustainable at that level.
9932 2018-02-07 02:51:58 Great to see Phil and geno back in same line... unstoppable... great show today and thx fleury for being in Pittsburgh! I see Crosby trying hard to get his 400th in this game. Too bad he didn’t get it but great performance! Rust post again empty net!! add oil @penguins
9933 2018-02-07 02:51:56 My “change oil soon” light came on and I can’t believe I already have to get a new car.
9934 2018-02-07 02:51:47 Tell that to the good people of South Dakota, who now have to deal with 210k gallons of oil.

There are no 100% safe ways to transport oil, that doesn't make appeals to emotion an argument
9935 2018-02-07 02:51:39 Because giving Alberta (/big oil) what it wants puts BC’s coast, Indigenous communities, water, and our shared climate at risk.
9936 2018-02-07 02:51:39 Innovation in oil and gas like in renewables has been incredible.  We need all our energy sources. 

Innovation is progress bans are not.
9937 2018-02-07 02:51:16 So you are not driving a car that uses gas and oil right? Cause that would be hypocritical...
9938 2018-02-07 02:51:12 TBH i got so fristrated that I cut ally straight off...but honestly deep condition weekly and find a good oil for your hair
9939 2018-02-07 02:51:05 Ben Ngubane should also be reported to the UN,AU and SADC for his involvement in the Central African Republic's oil fields with the Gupta's.Looting SA was not enough, Zuma and co. have been involved in cross border activities in other African countries as well(DRC,Sudan and CAR)
9940 2018-02-07 02:51:04 Dear Rush documentary about the pipeline who think you want the pipeline stopped because of Mother Nature show all the garbage you left behind front end loaders were needed to remove and how did you get there and stay war you used oil based products you cannot live without paid4
9941 2018-02-07 02:50:58 #That's"Super"! 
These enormous cargo ships can hold over 300,000 tons of oil
9942 2018-02-07 02:50:55 Exactly. When oil prices peaked on 6/24/14 & began their year-and-a-half descent, that was definitely on my mind, & not just because I was involved.

Coal is already a dead letter. Gas finishes imploding once people realize algae rotting in a hole can replace it. $25/barrel oil.
9943 2018-02-07 02:50:54 So, I don't know if you know this, but "white supremacy" is not necessarily synonymous with "White".

And If you want to talk about rampant greed, look no further than Islamic oil moguls and their ski resorts built in the desert using fossil fuels.
9944 2018-02-07 02:50:52 Love that #mango was used to naturally intensify, and that they used avocado oil #Genius 
9945 2018-02-07 02:50:46 Hey yeah like that pesky "don't drill for oil everywhere there's water" rule or the "please keep your industrial waste out of our rivers" rule or even the "hey remember the banking practices that caused the great recession, let's not have any more of those" rule.
9946 2018-02-07 02:50:43 Not Amish, solar electric. We’re building houses that don’t need oil, better cars that don’t need oil or gas, better polymers without oil.
9947 2018-02-07 02:50:42 I have been using this downturn to add to Cdn light oil, and liquids rich gas E&P. 

I have been selling AECO dependent gas producers, for now. 

Names I like most: $SPE and $VII.  And to a lesser degree $WCP, $VTE and $CJ only until $5.

Names I wouldn't touch: $PONY and $BIR.

9962 2018-02-07 02:47:53 Of course they found something wrong with my car when all I needed was an oil change -.-
9963 2018-02-07 02:47:43 So sick- One of the things that Momar Qaddafi did was make use of oil revenue to give everyone a home to live in, all citizens. We could do that here- no? US & European allies destroyed THAT.

9968 2018-02-07 02:47:33 I would be very happy drinking #BCwines knowing we are protecting our environment, our majestic marine wildlife & coastline from increased oil tanker traffic & liability that big oil companies do not take. Here in #Britishcolumbia we have the best of both worlds right now :)
9969 2018-02-07 02:47:21 i do not care what you say about palm oil,,,,i care about the environment you destroy,,,the animals and people that have to suffer for your greed of the dollar,,
and the health that is at risk from your product,,,,i do not polish my words anymore,,,there is too much going on ,,,,

9972 2018-02-07 02:46:34 Our economy depends on not having oil spilled in our water ways and our soil.  As I said before, Kinder Morgan's spill record is poor and their clean up is poor too.  BTW, Alberta must like the federal tax money helping support the tar sands.
9973 2018-02-07 02:46:33 Coconut oil is not meant to be use for the face. All it does is clog your pores even more
9974 2018-02-07 02:46:30 When will Trump be selling this off for oil and coal exploration again?

9976 2018-02-07 02:46:26 #bcwineboycott for once I am with the Alberta government. Small business in oil and gas are hurting and..well what can I say.  Something has to be done to shock the BC electorate.Maybe go without your gas, diesel and oil plus your cell phones. All made with the evil product.
9977 2018-02-07 02:46:24 Dear @elonmusk   It has come to the attention of the Royal Society of Catapults and Hot Oil that you have sent a motor car into space without the society’s approval. Our solicitors await your response.

9984 2018-02-07 02:45:59 Surprised you didn’t blame the oil companies and climate change.
9985 2018-02-07 02:45:51 The *Liberal* federal govt says there will be this demand for oil for at least another 100 years. Royalties from this oil (which is being sold anyways) will pay for advances in clean energy, as well as health care, education, etc. This oil will be consumed, just for more money.
9986 2018-02-07 02:45:47 For your scar due to acne, you can eventually use some Olive oil, or Argan Oil, also  Bi-Oil.
9987 2018-02-07 02:45:42 #BHM Day 6:
Does my sassiness upset you?
Why are you beset with gloom?
’Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
Pumping in my living room.
Just like moons and like suns,
With the certainty of tides,
Just like hopes springing high,
Still I’ll Rise - Dr. Maya #RIP

9990 2018-02-07 02:45:10 As it's always from each Kuwaiti oil barrel charity for humans goods is there. God bless Kuwait.
9991 2018-02-07 02:44:59 Have you ever seen a man so passionate about locally produced oil?
Bet not.
9992 2018-02-07 02:44:58 I would suggest @TristinHopper talk to his source and ask him how that additional gasoline would get into PADD5 given that we have a rail capacity shortage (which has limited the oil-by-rail capacity) and where would he suggest they off-load tankers in YVR? 1/
9993 2018-02-07 02:44:54 And so wonderful that dreamers.... real Americans that have so embodied the American spirit .... and SO SAD. You try to create a problem where there is none. Slandering a simple bi partisan majority agreement with snake oil MAGA bs, you created this problem to begin with !!!!!!
9994 2018-02-07 02:44:46 Want to really make a point. 

Turn off the flow of oil going there now.
9995 2018-02-07 02:44:36 I lived on texas gulf coast. The tar balls on the beach that stuck to your feet. The stench of sulfur. The flares  on the rigs. Oil is dirty! Old enough to remember Exxon-Valdez, New Carrissa and Deepwater Horizon.  I don't want that for Oregon or anywhere else. Renewable only!
9996 2018-02-07 02:44:24 Moving oil via rail as opposed to pipeline is not only less safe, but also takes precious rail time from moving other commodities that can't be moved via pipeline.
9997 2018-02-07 02:44:07 You can’t “make” food but you can fund Infrastructure , Medicare, Pension Funds, Military veterans, Military, Welfare, Housing, etc. You live in a dream world. I noticed the BC government hasn’t turned down the Billions in transfer payments from that “dirty oil money”

10003 2018-02-07 02:43:26 Wealthy Albertans who expect to retire here and contribute nothing tax wise to their new province can go elsewhere.  Or perhaps they can relocate to an oil damaged coast line.  (Note, this isn't for normal, decent Albertans, just the ones who think they own the world.)
10004 2018-02-07 02:43:24 Some of the levels are like crossing a tightrope but you're covered in olive oil.
