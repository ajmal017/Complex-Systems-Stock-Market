0 2019-01-23 23:58:23 An entire segment on a stock that you conclude not to buy? Lol.  How about talking instead on stocks you recommend? @jimcramer

2 2019-01-23 23:57:40 ETFs utilize machine learning to make trades based off indexes. Essentially it’s a basket of lots of different stocks/bonds commodities. 

The one depicted above is the only Marijuana focused ETF and in my opinion has lots of boom potential. I’d look into them, lots of options
3 2019-01-23 23:56:02 Heartwarming to see Democrats and Republicans come together for the opportunity to spill Latin American blood in exchange for those mouth-watering resources. Pumpkin Spice latte stocks about to go up.
4 2019-01-23 23:54:39 "The sharp S&P500 sell-off coupled with the rise in bond prices has stocks now priced at under 15x 2019’s estimated earnings compared to c37x the annualized return on 10-year treasuries. At 15x, the market is at the lowest point it’s been since late 2013." Bill Miller Q4 Letter

7 2019-01-23 23:49:49 I'm seeing indications that Trump could still use the House chamber. He has the power to "convene Congress".

If this is true, and he does this, it will be pwnage on a biblical scale. He might as well put Pelosi in stocks and have people throw rotten veg at her.
8 2019-01-23 23:49:45 Give me a minute while I dump my stocks and bonds.
9 2019-01-23 23:49:36 I also blame Rob Parker and the bullshit on the politics side that may be the cause of Twitter stocks are down

11 2019-01-23 23:48:53 Just played a bowser with 2 stocks and smash balls on
12 2019-01-23 23:47:41 Why could you have not destroyed the old stocks with the horrendously damaging Palm Oil in them,instead of making more money from misery?
13 2019-01-23 23:47:35 How about :
"Lock You Up, Stocks Go Up
14 2019-01-23 23:44:58 Indeed yes. There are a number of good wines from Lebanon. Chateau Musar probably the best (deservedly IMHO) and best known. Also quite widely available - and still relatively good value. I hate to mention supermarkets, but your nearest Waitrose usually stocks it.
15 2019-01-23 23:44:06 The population at large is hurting. The stock market is not indicative of the economy at-large. Most U.S. citizens do not own stocks or invest or have enough retirement to retire comfortably. In fact, most are dependent on Social Security as their only income.
16 2019-01-23 23:43:39 apple stocks rise by 30%.
17 2019-01-23 23:43:20 I own half of roots thanks to stocks shut your goofy ass up
18 2019-01-23 23:42:00 First thing about stocks... anybody can buy them... All you need is a brokerage account which you can open online in 10 mins as long as you have a social security number.. YOU DONT NEED MONEY TO DO THIS!
