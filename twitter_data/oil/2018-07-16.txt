11 2018-07-16 23:57:21 Looking my Mueller's face, makes me think the only thing that will help him is a Mineral Oil Enema.  That's one way he can stop talk of him being full of it.
12 2018-07-16 23:57:15 Oh, he /so/ chose. Though he hesitated at first, he lifted his hands once again, only to plant them into the mattress at her sides, lowering his head lower and planting a soft kiss into the small of her back, barely making contact, his breath chilling in contrast to the warm oil.

14 2018-07-16 23:57:07 I’ve been out of college for 7 months and I can no longer function without 8 hours of sleep, fat burners, MCT oil, pre workout, 7 cups of coffee, green tea extract, and a will to live

40 2018-07-16 23:56:26 そうなんですよ！安いからダメ元で買ってみたんですけど、それなりにカバー力もあるし侮れないですよね！
41 2018-07-16 23:56:24 The 2018 is superior but a lot more complex because they added things like oil change and tire balancing lol
42 2018-07-16 23:56:16 He was talking about competing in oil and gas.
43 2018-07-16 23:56:12 I'm bout that cod liver oil nootropic
44 2018-07-16 23:55:49 He did expel Russia  diplomats. He didn't call out a NATO ally over a pipeline because America trades energy with Russia. Trump himself was pursuing an oil deal with Russia. My god are you ignorant.
45 2018-07-16 23:55:48 No he isn't. Open up the Saudi oil wealth 
46 2018-07-16 23:55:41 Dude he called America foolish and blamed us for election meddling. He basically agreed with Putin to keep oil prices high enough for him to profit off of. That costs Americans major dollars across the board. If you're searching for the Deep State you might find Bigfoot first.
47 2018-07-16 23:55:26 Maybe the sea is contaminated long time ago of oil spills . or the ocean have red tide cause of their sickness .
48 2018-07-16 23:54:44 Not only that but “I changed the oil, rebuilt the tranny all while dancing backwards in heels.”
49 2018-07-16 23:54:17 It’s come to a pint where I be pleading with the oil like come on bruh don’t pop
50 2018-07-16 23:54:17 Damm!!! My pinchè car oil change is expensive as fuck!! $120 my ass
51 2018-07-16 23:54:10 So these “essential oil” machines…

Basically involuntary group vaping?
52 2018-07-16 23:54:00 Updates: @libyaherald
CBL latest financial statement shows increased oil revenues for first half of 2018
53 2018-07-16 23:53:33 Prime got Acure argan oil for $5. I just paid $10 for it at Whole Foods. Imma order it anyway.
54 2018-07-16 23:53:33 It’s not a hard message to be screaming “Republicans are not representing you. They are representing big oil, or coal, or Kochs..”. AND the GOP has put those donors over our security & democracy! @TomPerez @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi @SenateDems WE need clear bumper sticker facts
55 2018-07-16 23:53:33 E kasi naman ang mga RECIPE sa mga books at internet galing sa USA o Europe kaya ang gamit iyung mga local sa kanila. Eto namanh mga boploks dito ipagpipilitan na ricota cheese at olive oil, hahhaha, e di ginto ang presyo sa mahal.
56 2018-07-16 23:53:33 Allies like Germany whose economy depends on Russian oil n gas?
57 2018-07-16 23:53:32 Japanese cars are usually the cheapest to repair (not that they really need it) stay on top of maintenance(mostly oil changes) and almost any car will last you.
58 2018-07-16 23:53:20 I wish Oil City School district would get their head out of their ass
59 2018-07-16 23:53:07 Nicely done.  Oil?
60 2018-07-16 23:52:32 cleansing oil terus dibilas pake micellar water, fw, toner SomeByMi (kompres di muka 5 menit) dan lanjut toner hada labo. dah aja 
61 2018-07-16 23:52:24 The two olive trees and the healing oil
62 2018-07-16 23:52:23 プラスチックの扇子欲しいんだけどどこに売ってるんだろう…
63 2018-07-16 23:52:22 Got the oil changed in my old truck that I’m selling to my parents Thursday and Angie calls me saying there isn’t any oil.. instantly pissed me off, so I go over there and and check it and it’s fine. So now I’m sitting here in my truck pissed off for no reason..
64 2018-07-16 23:52:17 lmao Elon must have went boring with one of those flamethrowers and struck a trove of oil cause he is really blowing himself up rn
65 2018-07-16 23:52:01 Youch. Oil hurts.
66 2018-07-16 23:51:56 Your treasonous behaviour will be you legacy......how disgraceful of a example of the human species....you're the epitome of a false statue of patriotism truth honour and spirituality...you sir are nothing shy of a snake oil salesman.....your disgrace will follow you to the end
67 2018-07-16 23:51:43 Aku udah nerapin ini dari lama sebelum tau punya Suzy. Cuma bedanya aku setelah pake mc masih pake face oil buat angkat sisanya.

4 mc
2 face oil
2 fw
2 air dingin

Soalnya face oil aku bikin anget di muka. 

Kalo mau ikutin metode Suzy. Bilas air hangatnya berapa banyak?
68 2018-07-16 23:51:39 Next time I get my oil changed I’m gettin my radiator flushed
69 2018-07-16 23:51:22 Can't. Slathering coconut oil on my vagina
70 2018-07-16 23:51:15 oh yeah and oil smooths it out a ton, so the more oil the easier it is to spread. if you wanna make a sandwich with it, then less oil keeps it on your bread
71 2018-07-16 23:51:09 @SRuhle curious they mentioned Golan Heights at meeting,and Putin first said in the south then said southwest. Anything to do with Genie Energy and it’s large discovery of oil in the illegal Israeli occupied Syrian section of the Golan Heights?Putin,Trump,Netanyahu deal for OIL$?
72 2018-07-16 23:51:05 HUBBY IS SELLING

74 2018-07-16 23:50:45 Healthy Hair care steps

<don’t blow dry your hair or iron it.. it makes a world of a difference
<put coconut oil on the tips of your hair
<for a hair mask put in half of a banana and an avocado with a dash of coconut oil in then leave for 1 hour and wash hair as usual
75 2018-07-16 23:50:35 oh dear, another guy ignoring 1000s of students, scientist, academics, universities and even the oil industry and forcing his astrology-climate views on us. 
I love the final words  "..the end" :)
76 2018-07-16 23:50:11 Yeah that’s true too. Mine used to stay giving me bump until I discovered tea tree oil helps and I haven’t had problems since.
77 2018-07-16 23:50:05 So Trump goes to NATO to kick ass and get everyone focused on the mission. Ripped Merkel for doing billions in oil trade w Russia vs working within the alliance. Today everyone is chiding him for capitulating to Putin. Maybe @realDonaldTrump knows something we don’t. #MAGA
78 2018-07-16 23:49:42 Yes Cannabis oil is amazing and it is very good for the body - I have used licorice root different times when I have had sore throats and coughs but never knew about the liver - thats great to know - and hello alcohol with it in there thats amazing like a vitamin martini
79 2018-07-16 23:49:12 No OIL, No LIFE!!!
80 2018-07-16 23:49:11 On that topic: Do you eat fries that share oil with breaded things?
81 2018-07-16 23:49:02 Trump and peace = *oil and water*.
82 2018-07-16 23:48:48 Aloe vera & coconut oil are my fave 
83 2018-07-16 23:48:42 Low 70s is better than its been in a long time. There were investors wanting to add pipelines so oil could get to market but Trudeau cancelled 2 and lets protesters stop the one he bought.
84 2018-07-16 23:48:27 E panay kasi ang basa ng showbiz news na ang nilalamon daw ng English Monarchy at US elite mga organic, wutever that is. Kaya eto ang moringa at hibiscus na dating palamuti, ginawang salad na may vinegar na itim, PWE!E wala namang OLIVES dito, olive oil daw.
85 2018-07-16 23:48:20 Cleanser: using oil from the kitchen I'd suggest canola oil wash face twice daily.  You can also use raw honey
Toner: aloe juice or witch hazel or rose water
Exfoliation: DIY chemical peel.  Just add a teaspoon of mashed up strawberries, yogurt, milk,  clay and aloe Vera gel.
86 2018-07-16 23:48:04 私はマスク被ると犬に尻噛まれるので羨ましいｯｯ
87 2018-07-16 23:48:00 Soooooo you oil paint on yourself?? 
88 2018-07-16 23:47:53 Keep up w maintenance and car should be good, most m3 owners I’ve talked to that take good car of their cars have them running really good but those who don’t even do a simple oil check are the ones that are fucked 
89 2018-07-16 23:47:39 Oh, brine the fish in that pickle juice... about half hour.... then outside for about half hour, then almond crust, then low temp broil or bake, oil that thing and I expect it is money. Ayeeee
90 2018-07-16 23:47:37 theyd taste like crude oil and paper money
91 2018-07-16 23:47:28 cosrx oil free birch sap moisturizer, clinique dramatically different moisturizing gel, vanicream lite lotion, neutrogena hydro boost water gel (if this isn’t the one you’re using already)
92 2018-07-16 23:47:27 ran into my young fool while we was waiting for oil changes and we get the rapping bout post grad/professionalism, Black lady next to us get the praising us for talking that lingo. #blackings
93 2018-07-16 23:47:26 From RBC 
There is increasing rhetoric suggesting that Trump may tap strategic reserves in an attempt to lower oil prices. That would trigger a knee-jerk reaction lower, but we question the effectiveness of a unilateral release and would view any sell-off as a “buy the dip” event
94 2018-07-16 23:47:25 Looks like West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil . . .
95 2018-07-16 23:47:16 everyone needs the Ordinary marula oil
96 2018-07-16 23:47:05 “I want my free oil filter!”
97 2018-07-16 23:46:59 私もそれ使ってます薄づきだから失敗感ないし何よりお安いですよね〜
98 2018-07-16 23:46:46 It does take time and thought, but I try to get around to every student every hour and that helps to "check the oil" in my classroom and understand if what we are doing is working. If not, change it to make it work better. #formativechat
99 2018-07-16 23:46:38 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
100 2018-07-16 23:46:28 Rainwater made $$$ on oil pipe back in the day!
101 2018-07-16 23:46:16 うわーん癒される…
102 2018-07-16 23:46:15 @LouDobbs Pres Trump did correct. Put your enemy at ease, Keep digging info on who-what-when-etc. Mueller interview the ones in Russia per treaty. Put  results  out for world to see. Shame Germany into dropping pipeline.  Sell them  our oil/gas at discount. VERY Smart @POTUS

106 2018-07-16 23:45:28 Understood. That's me with tea tree oil.
107 2018-07-16 23:45:18 What ever was said behind closed doors you can bet Putin recorded. This would give Putin more control over Trump. This is about the massive oil deal with Exxon.   Much to watch in the near future.

Stop saying Trump can't bare to think Russia helped elect him. Aren't we past that
108 2018-07-16 23:45:06 8 O's only,suggests to me someone who is not particularly bright,but decided to buckle down and burn the midnight oil.Well done on all the certificates you eventually picked up
109 2018-07-16 23:44:48 And oil in the low 70's.
110 2018-07-16 23:44:46 Had an oil change and battery replacement on Friday. Today, I'm stuck outside the bank in 90° weather and my car won't start 
111 2018-07-16 23:44:40 Exactly, and Trump just gave him  a billion $ boost in oil profits by pulling out of Iran deal.
112 2018-07-16 23:44:35 Snake oil salesman! Disgusting.
113 2018-07-16 23:44:31 A trick I just learned - Palmolive or strong dish soap will get oil stains out!!!
114 2018-07-16 23:44:30 Olive oil salt and pepper, and if you wanna get CrAzY just add whatever you’d put in a soup or pasta sauce
115 2018-07-16 23:44:28 A makeup artist sprayed like oil n water or zmth on chris evans for post serum steve on that medical bed thing & uhhhhhhhhh id gladly volunteer for that

118 2018-07-16 23:43:29 My friend has a house of over 10,000 felons in Midland Texas.  They break into his house steal utilities and go to the underground facilities 4-5 million$ homes 25ft. Underground next to shipping ln.s oil parties. Hmmm of Bush.
119 2018-07-16 23:43:16 was this 100% confirmed?  seems like oil would not have sold off 4% if it actually happened
120 2018-07-16 23:42:48 I hear people talking about their ability to help fight off invection (viral and bacterial) including mopping the floor with a certain type of oil to help their kids not get sick. I’d love to hear the research on that.
121 2018-07-16 23:42:19 Gaslighting at its finest. Pence family biz has left toxic waste sites 4 taxpayers to cleanup post bankrupting family gas/oil biz by bro Greg who is running for IN senate seat with out of state campaign $$'s. Nothing from inside Indiana. Real winners = Pence et al.

126 2018-07-16 23:41:14 Baby oil is better than any tanning lotion ever made
127 2018-07-16 23:41:04 I have this weed infused coconut oil (eating it gives you an edible high) and I ate some. Thought it would be like 7/8am but it was fucking NOON when I woke up. Been high most of today too  I took it at 1am lol
128 2018-07-16 23:41:03 I agree, coconut milk. And you could also try ghee for the butter. Trader Joe’s has a cheap jar of ghee. I’d even try coconut oil for the butter too.
129 2018-07-16 23:40:27 狗狼くーん！あっ違ったカミ君ー！
130 2018-07-16 23:40:25 Who happen to have a lot of oil, natural gas, not to mention a lot of  Nuc's

132 2018-07-16 23:40:16 I Tried To Give Kelly Almond Oil When We Were On The Boat & She Refused 
Now She Talkin Bout She Got Windburn 
133 2018-07-16 23:40:08 Put it mildly maybe we should stop feeding cash to the oil industry.
134 2018-07-16 23:40:07 夏とかTシャツに油のシミできるよねえ。あれ透けるからほぼ全裸みたいになるよ僕。
135 2018-07-16 23:40:04 Baby oil works wonders
136 2018-07-16 23:40:01 .@RoadshowPBS' second visit to the Second City uncovers first-rate finds such as a 1908 Chicago Cubs presentation piece, a Tiffany & Co. gold necklace, and a 1904 Henry Woods oil. Next at 7pm on #KLRU.

140 2018-07-16 23:39:11 Russian Conspiracy btwn Trump & Putin to steal the Presidency is a combination of Blackmail,Money & oil deals (Rosneft) for Trump & family! Trump has been Money laundering thru his resorts & RE for 3 decades for Russian Mafia. The U.S. Government has been captured by a MOBSTER!
141 2018-07-16 23:39:06 Deeply troubled by treason? What really bothers you except falling oil share prices?
142 2018-07-16 23:38:54 Indeed.  Starting to think what is going on isn't just about a pee tape.

Our old alliances were based on values: democracy & pluralism. (Also oil, but..)

Our new alliances are based on values, too: white racial purity & authoritarianism.
143 2018-07-16 23:38:28 As someone who is not American and I know history , its amazing how paranoid you are and hypocrites at the same time. Trump is the only American president who didn't start a new war and the deep state is extremely angry. They need there blood and oil
144 2018-07-16 23:38:22 All about Money and oil
145 2018-07-16 23:38:21 Lord no. Libya started pumping again, and people are realizing that the new Iran sanctions are going to be pretty ineffective at stopping oil flows...
146 2018-07-16 23:38:15 I can relate my eczema has flared up lately too. I’ve been using lots of coconut oil & Shea butter to keep it contained. It’ll be over soon

152 2018-07-16 23:37:50 I suspect with the current regime that finding a bottle of olive oil in the local store would suffice.

Incidentally, I'm being deeply, deeply cynical and sardonic. I think what those people are doing is awesome.
153 2018-07-16 23:37:47 We would have already had an expanded Syrian war over oil pipeline interests if the election results were different in 2016. Board members don't give $140m to a certain foundation for nothing

166 2018-07-16 23:36:22 Only if they find oil.
167 2018-07-16 23:36:21 trump is also the reason the barrel of oil has almost doubled.

But a gas tax

168 2018-07-16 23:36:15 I agree. I never disagreed with you.  I just see to much politicking on social media.  It's easy to do l. I get it. It's nothing against you personally but I can't stand when sports and politics mix. It's like oil and water to me.
169 2018-07-16 23:36:13 อันตรายสัสๆ
170 2018-07-16 23:36:08 It really doesn't.   Outside the EU/EFTA and North America, there are only 2 or 3 rich countries that are not small tax havens or oil producers.

Most other countries are poor, by EU standards.
171 2018-07-16 23:36:04 Alright listen up you ppl who want thick ass hair, mix egg/olive oil/honey together, slap it on ur scalp for 30 mins and wash the shit out of it.

177 2018-07-16 23:35:09 Putin does MANY bad things, but then i see America and i think..... maybe if America and Russia play as a team, they will not cause WW3 and can beat "IS" and end war on oil and work on other problems then mimimimimi!


btw, do you know Pence?

180 2018-07-16 23:34:48 Maybe it’s not what Putin has on “POtuS” tRump but what he’s promised him. An oil field? Sovereign control over Crimea? What is it? tRump is far more motivated by gain than by a perceived loss of status or dignity. He simply rejects the latter as fake.
181 2018-07-16 23:34:44 Right now they get the least care because it’s a business that snake oil salesmen are making money out of. At least we’d have better control of it and there’s be an answerable duty of care. Would you want to be in one right now? An essential service that’s not better privatised.
182 2018-07-16 23:34:37 Cooking oil for sure 
183 2018-07-16 23:34:17 Used to live in San Diego. When it did rain (after nine months), cars would hit the slick oil and slide everywhere. Worse than a blizzard.
184 2018-07-16 23:34:15 @foxnews why...?  Iran, Syria, nuclear weapons, oil gas sales to Europe....
185 2018-07-16 23:34:08 Hahaha dili lagi mag tugatuga
186 2018-07-16 23:33:43 I agree with Brian I don’t know anyone  argueing that we subsidise the UK. A number complain about oil money in its heyday being wasted. It’s unionist with their dependency gene constantly defending Barnett and happy to see English regions poorer that go on about subsidies.
187 2018-07-16 23:33:36 Do not ease up on them. That nonsense with Germany and Russia oil and gas is sure STUPIDITY. ..

202 2018-07-16 23:31:47 @NorthernlionLP I have a solution to your oil change problem.

Just remove the sticker from your window and act like you got it changed on time when you take it in.  It's the perfect crime.
203 2018-07-16 23:31:29 Okay grifter selling snake oil from her twitter profile while using fake profile picture. You are such a cliche.
204 2018-07-16 23:31:26 Lost in the treason- Putin said a US-Russia oil and gas cartel is in the works. "we can work together on regulation of international markets"
205 2018-07-16 23:31:14 No. It's okay if it's for the right reasons. Venezuelans are suffering tremendously while they sit on one of the largest oil reserves in the world. That's a solid reason. 

Invading a country with a nuclear arsenal over John Podesta's emails... not so much.
206 2018-07-16 23:31:00 Now I'm not saying he's a bad guy for this, but if the fry oil got him I wouldn't be too upset.

On second thought, just put the oil on my damn BLAND BURGER.

237 2018-07-16 23:25:12 They maybe a rising power soon if Trump gives them what they want. If Trump release the sanctions, Russia could make billions from the oil in the Arctic, Trump's tariffs could destroy our & our allies economy, & if we leave NATO, Putin could take the EU countries w/out a fight.
238 2018-07-16 23:25:09 AMEN TO THAT!!! We need all the trading partners we can get to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN...Putin said they want to buy American cars..Let's sell them cars..let's sell them steel, tools, oil drilling equipment..Let's sell them farming equipment..End the feud..They re-elected Putin

293 2018-07-16 23:18:39 The same method they use to plug the country economy to recession...after d militants reduced oil protections to zero level..the president want to sell assets or borrow money to savage the situation..the senate blocks him until the country went on recession..
294 2018-07-16 23:18:29 notice how eerily quiet the #OOTT fuckheads are lately?

309 2018-07-16 23:15:39 Why?

So China can't be a military threat to Taiwan if Taiwan is reliant on trade with China?

I get that Dear Leader criticized Germany for buying Russian natural gas (you know, kinda like how we buy oil from Venezuela), but that doesn't mean you have to pretend it was smart.

318 2018-07-16 23:14:51 A lot of them claim to have very defined uses for common ailments (like peppermint oil for upset stomach), I'd be interested in studies that test these claims. Less interested in the more abstract claims that could be chalked up to marketing.
319 2018-07-16 23:14:49 My take: until Tillerson is in the clear from any Exxon oil and gas interests (stocks, dividends, retirement plans, etc), he'll probably stay quiet, since Exxon has deals with Russia. Sad.

Photovoltaic is now cheaper than coal and oil generation in most of the world now—we're shutting down working oil and gas plants in favor of PV to save money now.

333 2018-07-16 23:12:38 That is a very foolish statement. Venezuela is a state in chaos with the collapse in oil revenues, a huge American inspired coup and a failing govt. this is nothing like democratic socialism generally and the Labour Party specifically. Try to think of some real reasons!

363 2018-07-16 23:08:30 The winning argument against anti-EV debates is that: battery technology is always changing, gasoline & diesel will always be dirty.

You can't refine your own gas and oil overnight but you can recharge your EV in 3-6 hours if one pays for 240v access.

399 2018-07-16 23:02:39 Essential Oil Tip: Never use water if you experience irritation because the Oil will simply repel it. If an essential oil causes irritation to your skin, dilute the area with a safe carrier oil to alleviate discomfort. #essentialoils

421 2018-07-16 23:00:46 Going on 5pm and gotta go get my car outta the shop.  Routine maintenance, oil change etc...  Getting out under $100.00...that's a GOOD Day!!!  Have a Good Evening Katie... Hope to catch you again tomorrow.  God Bless You and God Bless Us All!
422 2018-07-16 23:00:43 Maintenance is important to ensure a long life for your sewing machine. Most machines require oil to be added at regular intervals and it's also important to regularly clean dust and lint that collect in and on the machine.

425 2018-07-16 23:00:38 Yes, but gluten as often rises along with sauce, cheese, sugar, oil, etc. sourdough bread usually isn’t the downfall of individuals in the same way that pizza and muffins tend to be, put in an admittedly oversimplified way.

Mostly jungle, nowhere near the world’s largest oil reserves, and in 1955 (ish) Jimenez Perez became world’s biggest embezzler (cf 1966 Guineas book of records). Always politically troubled..

Cause you know what’s going to limit the free market more than any other influence? Climate change.

And you won’t be fighting over oil. You’ll be fighting over water and shelter.

Splurge a little on your existence.

Burning rubber or midnight oil?
462 2018-07-16 22:55:39 Habu did that because of fire/spill hazards due to leakage of fuel/oil/hydraulic fluids prior to systems sealing at operating altitude. Not comparable with lift/thrust issues of V/STOL (or STOVL) aircraft under high payload.

466 2018-07-16 22:55:18 Right now, Russia represents a far more advanced version of oligarchic pseudo-democracy the U.S. I'll take fighting with Democrats over that nightmare any day. It's a lot harder to fight when your state kills journos and uses forestry/fishing regs as a cash grab for oil barons.
467 2018-07-16 22:54:54  we use real butter, and most of our food is cooked in Canola or Olive oil. I’m keeping track of it all.
468 2018-07-16 22:54:49 Trump also was manipulated to nod to regulating in coordination with Russia the price of oil to be high. For Russia high oil prices is awesome, for the US economy it's bad. #tytlive

Attack Putin from the left, not the right.

539 2018-07-16 22:45:22 The increase in health insurance is because of the ACA. And since we are not a member of OPEC we don't control the price of oil, therefore we don't control the price of gas.
540 2018-07-16 22:44:46 So the guys changing my oil went to reset my dashboard&it said "slow circles to calibrate",neither of them have ever seen it before, spent 20 minutes messing with my car to get it to go away, asked my dad&literally all it meant was I needed to drive in circles to fix my compass

560 2018-07-16 22:42:00 Last time I checked Hammer was (obviously) the great-grandson of Jewish oil mogul Armand Hammer. But, Buzzfeed, of course. Makes sense.
561 2018-07-16 22:41:58 Oil & energy & Arctic & Trump & Putin & the NRA & the Globe What Trump did today & in the past is disgraceful.What is GOP doing to stop DT’s wrongful actions and words & alignment with Putin & damage being done to United States Of America & our way of life & election & elections
562 2018-07-16 22:41:57 "Jane, this pizza tastes...off."
"Oh it's because I infused it with essential oils instead of fresh herbs. Rosemary oil and oregano oil to be more specific."
563 2018-07-16 22:41:48 When you can’t find an answer online, go to a Facebook LOL

Is it legal to sell and buy CBD oil online?
564 2018-07-16 22:41:43 It’s all good! I realised I didn’t have oil anyway NotLikeThis
565 2018-07-16 22:41:42 Why is it that you focus only on the past.  Are you still intimidated by Hilary?  Why does she still matter? You won remember, you keep telling us that.  Private meeting with Putin, did he give you any advice on Germany?   Is he going to stop the oil line to now because you said
566 2018-07-16 22:41:41 Waiting for a world that doesn't trade blood for oil
567 2018-07-16 22:41:24 I think I gotta try that CDE oil 
568 2018-07-16 22:41:15 Hi prosper, I am interested just what I was looking for to oil my rusty development skills. How do I get in?
569 2018-07-16 22:41:10 Thank you! I'm going to miss it though.

I definitely want to check out the CBD oil after bootcamp. I appreciate the advice from last night, and will be looking forward to watching some mental health streams when I'm back. 
570 2018-07-16 22:41:07 I literally just read about hing yesterday and it seems to be fine for my diet. I’m going to try it out. I’ve mostly been using green onion and garlic oil.
571 2018-07-16 22:40:58 We can reduce the running cost and carbon footprint of all refrigeration and Air Conditioning by approx. 20% if YOU will OK the use of Cold Plus to remove oil fouling from systems.
Please just say that you @Danfoss will not void your warranty of compressors using Cold Plus
572 2018-07-16 22:40:54 That's awesome right there..
573 2018-07-16 22:40:53 Are you on the 'joint warfare?' I take fish oil because I'm allergic to krill sadly

576 2018-07-16 22:40:48 Argan oil worked for me in the interim! But ultimately I had to cut it off :(
577 2018-07-16 22:40:41 Trump wants improved relations with Russia, but at NATO summit he berated Germany for buying oil from Russia. #TrumpPutinSummit #IdiotPresident
578 2018-07-16 22:40:30 I do agree with you about the other countries. Bush had no business in Iraq other than wanting their oil.
579 2018-07-16 22:40:27 Canadians have been getting the mysterious robocalls about the Trans Mountain oil pipeline and tanker expansion project since July 1. Sources in the Greater Toronto Area say they were called last week #kindermorgan #abpoli #bcpoli #cdnpoli #TMX

584 2018-07-16 22:40:04 Oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly oil/Natural Gas at tidewater displaces dictator oil/Gas from regimes that toss our  off buildings. Obstructing Canada oil = killing #LGBTQ @PrideToronto

586 2018-07-16 22:40:00 Ocasio clearly hasn't seen or ignores the data and is pitching lies about unemployment numbers for votes. She has no evidence to back her wild claims against Capitalism. Rather tragic if voters buy her socialist snake oil.

588 2018-07-16 22:39:20 Are you even living on planet Earth? He just got done telling Merkel not to expect the USA to defend her country from Russia and then buy their oil. No wonder you lost. You’re either a very bad liar, are just a puppet like the rest of your friends tweeting garbage today or both!
589 2018-07-16 22:38:52 Crimea is too far gone. If Europe wants heating oil this winter -- and they do -- we're gonna have to let that one go for the time being.

Strengthening NATO (and fast-tracking interested parties' entrance) and expelling Russian diplomats would be at the top of my list.
590 2018-07-16 22:38:45 You can get CBD oil in health shops.    It's legal and you can't get high on it.

596 2018-07-16 22:38:14 And olive oil maybe even a lil garlic powder or salt
597 2018-07-16 22:38:05 Data is the new gold/crude oil...
598 2018-07-16 22:38:02 @shakingcrab why would you have on your menu “ notify your waiter if you are allergic too something “ to then tell the customer everything is cooked in the same oil so you can only get drinks . Unacceptable

601 2018-07-16 22:37:53 Remember how the gas prices were low? That's because Obama put sanctions on Russian oil. It hurt their economy. Removing those were priority one for Russia. For their national profit. Look at gas prices now. That could NOT have been Obama as Rand says. Rand is just a shrill.
602 2018-07-16 22:37:51 今日もうほんと使い物にならない気がする
603 2018-07-16 22:37:15 Not me. Many I would say most don't understand get  the urgency n catastrophic nature of ghg emissions.

The oil did n do. 

 Public also use it's  for  comfortable & high standard of living.. oil companies for monetary profit.

They shld have swapped to renewables in 80s.
604 2018-07-16 22:37:15 Remind me, how did that murderous genocidal dictator come to power again? And the old ‘well there was other countries doing it as well’ is reprehensible considering you know what direction the nations oil reserves went and STILL maintain the lie that the USA were doing good.
605 2018-07-16 22:36:53 They might want to look upon hybrid engineered duel fuel (sugar-soy oil lpg infused propelled type alternative lpg gas) what alternative to coal does exist, ensuring sustained supply of coal and alternative fuel so hybrid duel technology powered so very important.
606 2018-07-16 22:36:34 How does getting NATO to build up their defense help Putin?

How does trying to replace Putin's Natural Gas to Germany with US Natural Gas help Putin?

How does arming Ukraine help Putin?

How does strenthing US gas and oil production help Putin's primary export?

And sanctions.
607 2018-07-16 22:36:33 The Notley government seems to have the support of much of the oil industry, (at least the thinking part of it) and seems to go overboard to help it out. Why it would sacrifice its credibility with its environmental supporters is beyond me, but that's politics.
608 2018-07-16 22:36:31 Both great movies but you are aware there's more to life than just oil and markets right 
609 2018-07-16 22:36:26 Oil production country , one of the poorest.  Shows how Westminster treats others, with utter contempt to it's basic needs
610 2018-07-16 22:36:13 float on the lake, put on some tanning oil and forget about everything.
611 2018-07-16 22:36:10 I used coconut oil the entire pregnancy and have like three stretch marks on my hips and like three on my inner thighs!
612 2018-07-16 22:36:07 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
613 2018-07-16 22:35:27 If we had half this freakout when Trump praises Saudi Arabia as we did today, we might actually make the world a better place but they give us Oil so it's apparently ok that they are one of the worst regimes in the world.
614 2018-07-16 22:35:24 I’m so blessed with the best coworkers who will tell me that I have a tank top tan, spray me with tanning oil, and send me outside to tan it over before lessons start.

Kindness still exists in the world
615 2018-07-16 22:35:19 What oil blend?? 
616 2018-07-16 22:35:07 Be sure that every year you get new oil multiple times and an engine diagnostic. You'll sleep better with the knowledge that your car is safe and dependable.
617 2018-07-16 22:35:04 Hey Col. @KurtSchlichter - is it me or is the “no blood for oil” crowd now dressing up like they’re Patton?
618 2018-07-16 22:34:59 What about high fat intake daily? Olive oil very energy dense
619 2018-07-16 22:34:58 Saw the press conference live. American oil has already slowed down, and anything else would be deyrimental to the Russians, and why should we care? Enjoy your evening.
620 2018-07-16 22:34:53 Instead of sunscreen I applied coconut oil will I die

624 2018-07-16 22:34:22 I KNEW you were owned by the Deep State!  Didn't Putin run them out of Russia?  
Does Iran have or will have their own monetary system like Libya was going for?  Deep State wants the oil, but doesn't want to pay for it. 
They've got us in debt, whata YOU gonna do about it?
625 2018-07-16 22:34:14 Those with spines @SenJohnMcCain @JeffFlake and @BenSasse - everyone else is a loser.
626 2018-07-16 22:34:11 On my 21st my family hit me up for brunch while my oil was being changed. I Uber there and ended up going to three bars and a club all before 2pm. is this what adult feels like???????

629 2018-07-16 22:33:50 Why are you ok with Germany working with Russia on oil pipeline. That you applaud apparently.  Trump asked them to stop it.  That you are mad about.
630 2018-07-16 22:33:40 I keep thinking we've hit peak stupid. Unfortunately, as with peak oil, every time we think we're there, it turns out we find ways to discover new reserves.
631 2018-07-16 22:33:39 I'm making roast pork, a small baked potato, corn on the cob and a tomato, cucumber salad with an olive oil, vinegar dressing.  Is that a meal hubs could have?  If he can't have the pork I could substitute a roast chicken

638 2018-07-16 22:32:33 Technically isn't the oil that's killing them, though.
639 2018-07-16 22:32:32 I took an Epsom salt footbath = to absorb magnesium through the skin.

648 2018-07-16 22:31:25 YES and the leader( Trump ) is man who is illegally in office and wants to have oil shares in the Russia pipe line and will sell the USA to get it.

651 2018-07-16 22:30:59 The Western Nanny States can't isolate Russia when they can export energy border to border with China. Russia gets money that the Western States send to China for their goods, China buys oil from Russia.

654 2018-07-16 22:30:31 So I wore my dragon ball shirt today and I was getting my oil changed. After sometime the assistant came inside to talk about how the car is doing, and then we hang a 5 minute discussion about the future of dragon ball.

661 2018-07-16 22:29:39 @realDonaldTrump I hear Mar a Lago is now proud to offer Ukrainian prostitutes from the GRU Finishing School, and a tapas menu to include Soylent Crimean and a tapenade of Syrian olives, bread, and pressed oil. #TreasonSummit #TheResistance #Impeach45 #FoxNews #Helsinki
662 2018-07-16 22:29:18 As a chef I say a pan with oil,on quite a high heat,so as to crisp it right up!
663 2018-07-16 22:29:12 Getting oil imports from Russian counts as backing them? I have some disturbing news for you. You may want to sit down.
664 2018-07-16 22:28:59 Sure, if you ignore all of the evidence to the contrary. He's arming rebels against putin in Crimea, he's bombing their ally, Syria, he's sanctioning Russia and their other ally, Iran. He just attacked germany for being in bed with russian oil. He's corrupt, but he's not a puppet
665 2018-07-16 22:28:49 Funny how the people with the most money, oil companies and all the businesses dependent on oil (which is a lot) can't seem to find enough scientists to pay with all their big bucks to swing the world to their view of things.

670 2018-07-16 22:28:30 I dunno, consider:

"Where were you until 2AM last night?"

"Whose lipstick is on your collar?"

"Why did you think buying three pounds of coconut oil at Costco was a good idea?"

"Why are you hanging Christmas lights in May?"

"Where did you bury the treasure chest?"
671 2018-07-16 22:28:30 By all means, prevent the chub rub. I wear long bike shorts, but baby oil or generic vag chaffing gel work great too if you don’t want to get new clothes yet. This is the number one thing that would keep me from exercising is my thighs getting irritated.

677 2018-07-16 22:27:36 You imagine BC lives in splendid isolation and that oil spills respect international boundaries. Neither of those are true. Until you acknowledge that we live in an integrated market most of what you are saying comes off as simple white noise

682 2018-07-16 22:27:07 Got an oil change I didn’t even need cause my tires needed air and that comes with it. I’m doing well.
683 2018-07-16 22:26:50 Flamethrower, buddy!!! 

Preferably in front of snowflakes.
684 2018-07-16 22:26:49 Exactly which of his policies have aided Russia: Tax cuts? SCOTUS appointments? Tariffs? Illegal immigration? Aggitating for lower oil prices? Rebuilding US military? NK denuclearization talks? NATO funding commitments? He has a strange way of committing treason ...
685 2018-07-16 22:26:49 @MalcolmNance - so good to see you on @AriMelber. I was shocked and disgusted watching the roll out of the Trump-Putin alliance sharing the oil and gas industry with their friends in the Middle East. Today the Anti-Trump-Putin Alliance must get started. #Register to vote!
686 2018-07-16 22:26:48 i like to crisp them in a little oil they’re delicious
687 2018-07-16 22:26:44 I am a witness that castor oil does grow your eyelashes out and make them grow thicker !!!! 9/10 recommendation

690 2018-07-16 22:26:30 Why oil prices are suddenly tanking: BECAUSE THE REPUBLICUNT FINANCIAL & "OIL" CORP "KOCH"-SUKKAS KNOW THEIR MID-TERM "CAMP-PAIN" MONEY IS NOW USELESS, SO THEY AIN'T GOTTA STEAL NO MORE FROM THE "REAL" AMERICAN PEOPLE !!!!

693 2018-07-16 22:25:56 No the alternative is that BC and the Puget Sound get oil via rail, via barge and via less well-regulated tankers. Those are the options.
694 2018-07-16 22:25:56 I saw many at the OC fairgrounds that reminded me of him. Family code phrase when someone is bullshiting us with lies. 'Snake oil"
695 2018-07-16 22:25:52 Could injecting olive oil into the bloodstream work in a similar way to injecting air into the blood stream?
696 2018-07-16 22:25:50 When the senate sent several members (& one house member) of the appropriations committee to Russia over the Independence Day holiday,
they were all from oil/gas/pipeline states.

702 2018-07-16 22:25:34 Heavy rains have forced the postponement of tonight’s Schaeffer’s Oil Southern Nationals Series event at Volunteer Speedway. We’re looking for a suitable makeup date and will announce it ASAP. Armbands can be used for 411 Speedway Tuesday night.
703 2018-07-16 22:25:21 Here's a little story: a client of mine lives in a two-million-dollar house he's 68 years old, spent his life working for the Venezuelan government oil engineer or something. Plan to spend his retirement in his American home where he worked his whole life on his government
704 2018-07-16 22:25:20 So how come Donny doesn't go after them again like papa bush & junior bush who showed them how to build their military & was buying their oil for the USA make it great again
705 2018-07-16 22:25:20 So go ahead, Trump lovers, go attack Hillary all you want. If it makes you feel better. AT LEAST, we KNOW she wasn't great. But you are very seriously gullibly fallen into the Trump Trap...just like a master snake oil salesman wants you to.
706 2018-07-16 22:25:20 What’s next? Is President Trump going to let Putin “annex” Alaska? Just as long as he says we can keep some of the oil there?
707 2018-07-16 22:25:18 Heavy rains have forced the postponement of tonight’s Schaeffer’s Oil Southern Nationals Series event at Volunteer Speedway. We’re looking for a suitable makeup date and will announce it ASAP. Armbands can be used for 411 Speedway Tuesday night.
708 2018-07-16 22:25:16 Why can't Amazon Prime Day be full of things like cbd oil, bobby pins, sephora products, kombucha, rose and yoga class vouchers. NECESSITIES PEOPLE.
709 2018-07-16 22:25:12 WTF? Armie Hammer is (obviously) the great-grandson of Jewish oil mogul Armand Hammer. But let's make a bunch of random shit up instead. Unsuccessful comedy trumps all.
710 2018-07-16 22:25:08 Really the only way to cook them properly
711 2018-07-16 22:24:54 I read it wasn't made from sustainable palm oil which is a real shame

714 2018-07-16 22:24:42 Chicken soup? Inhaling some lavendar essential oil from a tissue? And next year lots of garlic in your dishes before winter...

716 2018-07-16 22:24:26 Seriously. Who here on my Facebook hasn’t tried CBD oil yet?  
717 2018-07-16 22:24:21 if you think the intervention in libya was about mega-rich capitalist states with cumulatively several times the proven oil reserves and GDP per capita of largely impovershed Qaddafi-era Libya rather than preventing state-enforced mass-violence against civilians, im prayin for u.

721 2018-07-16 22:24:02 When Trump falls - and it is now decidedly a question of "when" - it will be glorious to watch the number of dominoes he will take with him: the GOP, the NRA, Big Oil, Big Pharma...
722 2018-07-16 22:23:59 There is money.  Lots and lots of oil and gas money.
723 2018-07-16 22:23:58 しかし今週は手付かずの地獄が待つ。
724 2018-07-16 22:23:57 Why don't you talk about Nexen's pipeline spill- 5 MILLION litres! For which they were fined a measly 750K. What's your mental block Kenney that you can't get why people are troubled by the shipping of oil?
725 2018-07-16 22:23:45 I love when I come to Ford's "quick lane" for an oil change and the wait is always over an hour and a half. And 3 on Saturday.... 
726 2018-07-16 22:23:41 三連休素晴らしい。

732 2018-07-16 22:23:02 Both sides but don’t move them in the pan until you flip them. Make sure they are dry before they hit the pan. 
733 2018-07-16 22:23:01 Why are taxpayer dollars being utilized to clean up Vice President Pence’s failed oil company spills ?
734 2018-07-16 22:22:48 AB and Norway are different. Norway has access to tidewater for its trade goods. AB’s environmentally friendly, Gay friendly, feminist friendly Oil is obstructed and sold at a discount to USA. Also AB pays millions to support QC. If AB separates then we’d be equal to Norway
735 2018-07-16 22:22:43 Sear one side so they don't turn to rubber erasers, devkaze the pan with white wine.
736 2018-07-16 22:22:42 There is an a one goddamn CEO oil company executive that ever paid for his golf game or a dinner a vacation or piece of tail-in his entire ten year and this is news ... that one got finally got caught..
737 2018-07-16 22:22:00 Wake up #45 will lift sanctions, Exxon Mobile will use their technology 2 drill  untapped oil on millions of acres. Where is Tillerson?

740 2018-07-16 22:21:19 or in the real world norway had oil before the others and has done well with it..it used to have a green left govt but kicked them out,... coincidence?
741 2018-07-16 22:21:16 The founders did not understand cyber attacks that would influence elections. This is like going to one Car Repair center, believing the owner is ripping you off, but you still go for the oil changes every 6 months because they claim to deliver a better product.

746 2018-07-16 22:20:47 How tf I lost a gram of oil? Grrrrrr...
747 2018-07-16 22:20:40 The last 20% or so of the bag of puffy cheetos where they are just sopping wet with oil can not be defended by anyman
748 2018-07-16 22:20:37 That’s why under Trump, US now controls oil, has the strongest economy, tons more $ into military. If Putin was so bad, why would he want all of this for America?
749 2018-07-16 22:20:31 Take fabulous pictures of it by all means but eat the processed  machine oil at your peril.
750 2018-07-16 22:20:30 ผมเลียให้นะ
751 2018-07-16 22:20:26 in addition to levying harsh sanctions in retaliation to election interference, the obama admin had been stoking support for domestic natural gas production, which was dropping global oil prices and pretty much wrecking the russian economy
752 2018-07-16 22:20:19 While I agree, these oil tycoons are greedy and only look to fill their pockets, drilling for oil does not cause volcanic eruptions.
753 2018-07-16 22:20:16 So not only is President Trump the worst at being at being a racist but he is also the worst at being a Russian agent. Wonder how much trouble he is in for bashing Merkle about buying Russian oil? And imposing those sanctions on Russia? #qanon
754 2018-07-16 22:19:48 Kok sama ci. Aku malah face oil natural green yang harganya mayan:)))

757 2018-07-16 22:19:07 Why does it take the dealership 90mins to change the oil, but it takes Jiffy Lube 5?
758 2018-07-16 22:19:07 Germany's last chancellor sits on the Board of the pipeline to Russia, Nord Stream, and Russian state oil company Rosneft!

763 2018-07-16 22:18:35 #Oil is not immune... bullish Monday> Trump to release SPR, #OPEC pumps more, demand slowing down, #trade war uncertainty, China sourcing #Iran imports. Is that it? Just the beginning of the week.

765 2018-07-16 22:18:17 Exactly which of his policies have aided Russia: Tax cuts? SCOTUS appointments? Tariffs? Illegal immigration? Aggitating for lower oil prices? Rebuilding US military? NK denuclearization talks? NATO funding commitments? He has a strange way of committing treason ...
766 2018-07-16 22:18:11 Well, Trumpkin's not really classy enough for coconut oil.  He's a Crisco kind of guy.
767 2018-07-16 22:17:43 @FoxNews America government destroyed Libya by lying to their citizens and Arafat warned his people because we were looking for their oil. Libya is suffering now . We did the same thing in Egypt where we sponsored riot against sitting government.
768 2018-07-16 22:17:41 Prime Day be like, SAVE BIG ON A GALLON OF COCONUT OIL!!1!1!!one
769 2018-07-16 22:17:38 It varies by manufacturer, but Erabu sea snake oil has DHA content similar to a typical fish oil supplement—but lower EPA. The prob w/ supplements is they oxidize over time & end up containing a fraction of the of n-3 PUFAs indicated on the label. Better to just eat fish, IMO. 
770 2018-07-16 22:17:21 I've passed like 100times by the shop to see if our mechanic was available... I just need my oil changed hurryyyyyy!!!
771 2018-07-16 22:17:09 Haven’t read it, but The Art Of The Deal involves removing one’s pants immediately upon encountering an opponent and bringing out the good coconut oil.
772 2018-07-16 22:17:06 Maybe not just the overall effectiveness, but also comparing brands, such as doTERRA and the vitamin shoppe? Are there differences in the actual purity of the oil, etc.?
773 2018-07-16 22:16:42 Ask someone in your upline if they have one or know who does. I had been sick for two months and my doctor had no clue. A Zytoscan recommended Essentialzymes and Motivation oil and in two weeks of using those I felt like a new person!
774 2018-07-16 22:16:38 So Trump bought Putin? but Trump hates the fact that Germany is buying oil from Russia and we killed 400 Russians in Syria? What are you talking about l?
775 2018-07-16 22:16:34 “Producing more oil and gas” really got me. It’s like someone sponsored this weeks issue and he needed to squeeze it in somehow 
776 2018-07-16 22:16:30 that's not possible! We were out of oil in 1975 and had to wait in gas lines as a result!
777 2018-07-16 22:16:03 @SecPompeo   Attention please: With VLADIMIRO PUTIN, as a good Siberian wolf, ALWAYS HAVE TO GO VERY CAUTIELY, BECAUSE ALSO "IT IS VERY CONVINCING", to press oil prices upwards, FAVORING, PERVERSE REGIMES FOR TERRORISM, SUCH AS THOSE THAT MOVE IN "IRAN", SYRIA AND VENEZUELA.
778 2018-07-16 22:15:47 I use As I Am, Leave in Conditioner, Double Butter cream, curling Jelly, Twist Defining Cream, And Argan Oi from Morocco Shampoo and the Conditioner. I also use Jamaican Castor oil ^^
779 2018-07-16 22:15:46 my scent today is an enticing mix of Maison Louis Marie Le Long Fond perfume oil and Coles-brand turkish bread with harissa hummus
780 2018-07-16 22:15:39 Argan oil and some light oil, tea tree oil or jojoba are good friends for the beard (and face) I use tea tree oil for my face. Helps with the breakouts

782 2018-07-16 22:15:31 They are always last to the party. Like Oil to go to 200 from 147. (Tanked) oil to 20 from 25(70 +now) qcom 1000 from 750. Don’t trust them
783 2018-07-16 22:15:28 Hourglass vanish stick foundation, L’Oréal true match lumi glotion, nudestix nudies in bondie bae, Estée Lauder double wear nude water foundation, Anastasia bh palette in soft glam, glossier boy brow, drunk elephant marula oil, fenty gloss bomb, urban decay all-nighter

785 2018-07-16 22:15:18 I’ve only half met his first wife once (true), but that was less than stellar. Still, Putin could pull out of Ukraine tomorrow, hand over all their nukes, provide discounted oil to all of Europe, call for (and lose) open elections, and many would still rate it a disaster.
786 2018-07-16 22:15:06 Trumps trips to Mar-A-Lago cost taxpayers at least 6.6 million in 2017  "Newsweek."
Why would he give oil companies drilling rights in National parks? If you aren't aware of the emoluments clause, please read.
787 2018-07-16 22:15:05 If you have some, I find that putting peppermint oil on the roof of my mouth helps with migraines
788 2018-07-16 22:14:51 Yeah sometimes jon and oil can get to you..

There.. That should fix it
791 2018-07-16 22:13:46 Also, use both olive oil and butter.
792 2018-07-16 22:13:42 Thank you for this!! I use some oil in my hair but not daily and I definitely am going to invest in a cowash and silk wrap. I’ve heard lots of good things about both
793 2018-07-16 22:13:35 -if you have a stuck zipper, rub coconut oil on it and it will slide up 
-if your earrings aren’t going it, apply coconut oil once again to your earring holes
-to make a drink really cold quickly, wrap it in a wet paper towel and put it in the freezer for 15 mins
794 2018-07-16 22:13:35 Tiny bit of coconut oil in the water. Swirl the water first then drop it in. Perfect every time
795 2018-07-16 22:13:32 Just got an oil change and my car still says maintenance required??????? Excuse me
796 2018-07-16 22:13:31 I'm CERTAIN it will get better after the 0bama shows! (That sarcasm was so heavy there's no way I can lift it again. It gonna have to stay here.)
797 2018-07-16 22:13:26 bizarre day. "intelligence" from Obama admin, that claimed an actor caused Benghazi, and other september 11 protests, are just as credible today on those "intelligence" leaders talking smack today--- how's the bombing going? oil still being shipped via ferries to EU?
798 2018-07-16 22:13:21 Fucked up and forgot to charge my phone before coming to get an oil change 
799 2018-07-16 22:13:21 That right therethat would look gorgeous as an oil painting

801 2018-07-16 22:13:14 Biggest pet peeve.   Making appointments and waiting.     3pm oil change at dealership.  Here at 245.   Now 315 and car has yet to move 
802 2018-07-16 22:13:13 I got my Yoni Steam and shawty was like let it marinate for 24 hrs and then  spring this on him

I felt a thug tear fall when I said “there is no him” 

So she gave me a massage with rose water, lavender, bran and coconut oil & crushed rose quartz and amethyst

808 2018-07-16 22:12:10 On Obama’s watch, Putin:

Invaded Crimea
Invaded Syria
Invaded Ukraine
Hacked @DNC 
Increased Military Spending
Increased Oil Production
Aligned with China
Closed US Diplomatic Missions
Murdered Journalists at home
Murdered Opponents abroad

813 2018-07-16 22:11:22 Luckily, my oil change package came with tire repair, so it was covered both times. But still really annoying I want my mom to do all this for me hahahaha
814 2018-07-16 22:11:10 - try aromatherapy with lavender oil or eucalyptus. 
- try not to nap during the day.
- listening to calming music. (Rain, breeze, etc) 
- tell yourself mentally that your staying up all night, this lets your brain rebel into falling asleep.
815 2018-07-16 22:11:02 Imagine d SE n SS clamouring for regional govt n ur senators can not sponsor d bill. PMB is even withdrawing oil well license n giving it back to d person Bt u are not still appreciative. Even ur bro GEJ could not do dt. d dawn is near. Ur eyes will open by force
816 2018-07-16 22:10:55 The conditioner that comes with the dye is a deep conditioning and helps restore moisture & maybe avoid using a hair dryer/heat on the hair where possible? I use loads of conditioner to make up for my bleaching ... dove shampoo & condition the dry oil range has been a god send
817 2018-07-16 22:10:44 They can't hold their $1 pegs over long periods of time because 3P Stablecoins don't have the consensus of the international trade (& oil) community that they are worth $1. Only the USD has that.
818 2018-07-16 22:10:38 When I was five, I was there with my family. Parents were oil execs. I wanted to go to work with my brother. I fell asleep on the train and woke up in Kolkata. I had to survive. Eventually I was adopted by Australian parents and then traveled back to reconnect with family.
819 2018-07-16 22:10:32 The most inefficient way to run any organisation is to involve as many people as possible. This is dragging Labour back in time. Appalling plebiscite for every position of power. This will be like an oil tanker to turn.
820 2018-07-16 22:10:31 Dad, can you please send me my husband because I cry everytime I get an oil change
821 2018-07-16 22:10:30 little chimp is microchipped with her lab ID number, She can say mama, Prudence which is me. My missing baby boy is Musa a variation of Moses. Albanian I was in Turkey also at the time to pick up natural pain medicine, soap, skin oil
822 2018-07-16 22:10:28 Actually they are mostly pegged to the dollar since we start wars with anyone who plans to trade oil in any other currency.
823 2018-07-16 22:10:24 It has been an Monday:

* Car Wash
* Car Oil Change
* Grocery Run
* Hardware Store for faucet parts
* Post Office
* Prescription Pickup
* Finding another card skimmer on the ATM near the prescription pickup
* Emergency 3 hour Power Outage at Home

All on about 3 hours sleep 
824 2018-07-16 22:10:22 The droughts and hurricanes of the last few years have finally woken everyone up to the immediate threat of climate change, all new oil & gas prospecting has been banned, and the new carbon tax is funding a universal basic income.

831 2018-07-16 22:09:05 Indicted by who? The global community who did nothing to stop it because they were locked into Bretton Woods? Just like we got away with it, so will Russia, except in their case because they have bargaining power from oil and gas. Either that, or WW3 as a *%&^ measuring contest

866 2018-07-16 22:03:55 Oil drops today on fears Russia will increase production despite opec agreements. Perhaps Trumps visit had influence? Good for our wallets at the pumps.
867 2018-07-16 22:03:38 Trump attempted to poach the German oil business right in front of Putin.  That doesn't sound like a man holding onto his ankles to me.

879 2018-07-16 22:01:46 Maybe. But I'm conditioned to be immediately suspicious whenever the Venn diagram of Republicans and oil converge, I guess.
880 2018-07-16 22:01:35 Spoiler alert: IT IS.

You can even make tiny baguettes with it and have all the pasta with them. 

Also good: mix 1/4 cup of olive oil with a cup of parmesan and two twists of freshly ground pepper and dip the breadticks/baguettes in it. Oh my lord.

884 2018-07-16 22:01:05 Putin wants investment in Russia. They have nothing outside of oil and gas. The country is poor, the people are poor. Putin only stays in power through violence, corruption, and fear. Fuck Putin. He's not smart. He's a two bit dictator with a lotta nukes to back him up.

Hes been doing business with Russian heavy, their mob was infiltrated in Trump Tower, he houses Russian anchor babies/families, Miss Universe pageant in Moscow, the oil deal with Tillerson/Putin, were all done years ago.
905 2018-07-16 21:59:34 What is it all these #TreasonSummit libs are after? Trump has gone against Putin's interests in Iran, Syria, and oil production (while Obama helped Russia in these areas) and has been harder on Russia than any previous president. Would they prefer Trump threatened war?

914 2018-07-16 21:58:21 McCain you have lost your mind. President Trump didn't give anything away and if Germany stops getting it's oil from Russia that's good for us and bad for Russia. Always looking for a reason to put President Trump down. Why don't you just join the Damacrats or the media.
915 2018-07-16 21:58:07 Ryan is a Honey and Milk Toast Guy; fearful to stand up to Trump's Abuses of Power.  Just last week; Trump publicly chastised the German Leader for buying Oil from Russia.  Trump said, Russia is our Enemy!

918 2018-07-16 21:57:35 If denying Georgians the ability to get cannabis oil and pointing guns at kids means he “cares” about Georgians then he’s more delusional than I originally thought. Keep Kemp, I’ll take Cagle.

923 2018-07-16 21:57:09 It’s more basic than that... Trump owes the Russian government over 700 Million in back pay for business deals gone bad & he owns stake in a large oil refinery that’s Russian affiliated. Notice gas prices lately?? They basically own him
924 2018-07-16 21:57:02 Everyone knows hair tastes better with mustard. You need some spice to cut the oil of hair. DUH!
925 2018-07-16 21:56:58 Imagine getting tuna in oil rather than brine.
926 2018-07-16 21:56:51 Scooter made sure my car was kept up. All the oil changes, brakes, tires rotated, etc. The men next door to the shop made sure they cleaned my car every week, and I was always fed good. I was so spoiled 
927 2018-07-16 21:56:50 So 45 says because Germany buys oil from Russia that Germany is being "held captive" by Russia.

But he adores the Keystone XL pipeline in which Canadian oil is piped to the US.

I guess Canada now holds the US captive.

929 2018-07-16 21:56:37 So Obama drew a red line in Syria and did nothing. Trump warned Russia not to get involved when he bombed Syria . Obama withdrew missile system to protect Ukraine  from Russia, Trump re-started it. Trump called our Germany for taking Russian oil and is a NATO member-hmmm

934 2018-07-16 21:56:13 Fun fact: Iran was a democracy until 1953 when it was overthrown by a UK/US (CIA) funded coup because Iran moved to nationalize its Oil production and kick out BP
935 2018-07-16 21:56:06 Okay. Trump has sanctioned 1 Putin ally every 2.5 days since taking office. Including his son in law. His best friend. And the biggest oil oligarch. Trump has approved sales of arms to Ukraine. Trump opened up polish missle defense.
936 2018-07-16 21:56:06 because it's an election year and they want to pander to public opinion emotions, when in reality everyone knows ALL potus have to dealt nicely with China, Russia, North Korea & soon Iran... deals bring business to America even when its from enemy Countries.
937 2018-07-16 21:56:00 How is he Putin's puppet, when he has kept the Russian sanctions AND calling out Germany for using Russia's oil?

On the other hand was small changani bag with 2 sets of clothes of wc 1 was my last uniform, 2kg salt, pot & c/oil.
940 2018-07-16 21:55:40 I also wonder if any of this has anything to do with the current problems of gender identity which seem to be becoming more prevalent amongst teenagers-  I havent seen any analysis which looks at the effect of WFPB  based diet plus seed oil fast foods on teenage hormones
941 2018-07-16 21:55:22 I noticed you didn't say anything about oil and gas.
942 2018-07-16 21:55:03 Neither did Obama. Hillary was strong armed into it by Bush administration.  She admitted mistakes.  But, our National debt will be the biggest under Trump. He needs that oil deal with Putin. Putin is still attacking our National security today. Not past.
943 2018-07-16 21:54:51 I was hoping you bring that one up. Standard oil. How do you create a monopoly?You undercut the competition, making he good cheaper for the consumer. This happened, when the price was getting raised Foreign oil and other companies undercut standard because there was profit margin
944 2018-07-16 21:54:40 You realise now I'm going to come up with at least half a dozen plausible ways you could kill someone with olive oil as a thought experiment, and end up being a suspect if you're right.

947 2018-07-16 21:53:44 In the current business environment it is impossible to operate without data. The Economist has called it the new oil that will drive future growth. But organisations need the right kind of data to fuel their business: data needs to be accurate, up to date & relevant. Think #GDPR
948 2018-07-16 21:53:37 Please tell me you will do a proper ball gag bondage/leather video and picture set to buy and download separately, maybe even with oil too. that would be amazing. I love watching you drool with a ball gag in your mouth, please post a few more previews. x
949 2018-07-16 21:53:26 Drill for oil and see what happens, don’t require oil companies to clean and pay for damage and see what happens.
950 2018-07-16 21:53:18 I don’t even want to think about Xula bs.... they would fuck Up anything, even with instructions. What is CFA without peanut oil?
951 2018-07-16 21:53:17 Exactly. He said, it's a competition (as any business is) and he said, he thinks we'll win that competition too as now WE are the biggest producers of oil in the world.

Then libs said, OH GOD...there he goes with that winning again...he sucks....bla bla bla poopie head...bla bla
952 2018-07-16 21:53:13 Not any more than watching Obama allow Putin to annex Crimea, roll into the Ukraine, still cause trouble in Georgia and secure billions by selling oil to Germany via the Nord Stream II......that was Obama's gift he gave Putin, as promised on hot mic

971 2018-07-16 21:50:30 Every party has it's morons and scandals. @albertaNDP has had more than a few since being elected. Like calling conservatives sewer rats, Rob Loyola praising a murderous dictator (Hugo Chavez), keeping Tzeporah Berman while she sagged the oil sands etc
972 2018-07-16 21:50:21 Mine is when he lifted the overreaching regulations that opened back up jobs in coal, steal and oil. I also love every time he keeps a political promise.
973 2018-07-16 21:50:19 Tried cbd oil last night and have to say I could sleep on my side with my tendinitis and I got some sleep . 
974 2018-07-16 21:50:11 They told me i could only use this one certain kind oil so it was 24.99? But charged me 65$ i was like Uhm woahhhh 
975 2018-07-16 21:50:08 And they want to make oil deals and rip every natural resources the world has and split the profits. The only way this can be stopped is if we all unite. I want to be hopeful. It’s so much nicer than being scared shitless which I am at he moment.
976 2018-07-16 21:49:58 Tea tree oil helps reduce the appearance of acne scars ! Also, try microdermabrasion and remember to exfoliate. Ridding the skin of dead skin cells also helps reduce the appearance of acne scars(:
977 2018-07-16 21:49:54 Minnesotans know that we need dedicated rail transit to be a competitive market for the next generation and allow our people to not be chained to the oil industry, and have alternative options!
978 2018-07-16 21:49:47 If rather die in a car accident than go get my oil changed
979 2018-07-16 21:49:37 Coconut Oil is doing wonders on my hair and my daughters 
980 2018-07-16 21:49:34 You gotta get the tanning oil..and melt yourself lol..
981 2018-07-16 21:49:33 Washed my feet, put on some magnolia oil and had my cup of Rooibos in bed. This flu better behave, I foresee a beautiful night

988 2018-07-16 21:48:28 In fact, @realDonaldTrump's speech about #Russia oil in Poland last year was so tough, it was the energy industry equivalent of Reagan's "tear down this wall" speech. #TrumpPutinSummit
989 2018-07-16 21:48:23 True, but did you see how Putin bitched slapped him ass about the Iran deal? He was like you better get back in it, because there will be an oil shortage. The same deal the @GOP blasted Obama about.
990 2018-07-16 21:48:21 Dear @GoldmanSachs your promoted ad for oil is sickening. You are run by rich white Americans who are ruining this world for our children and grandchildren. Save your money for when the market for oil crashes because the world has been destroyed by your greed and ignorance.
991 2018-07-16 21:48:16 very insightful. If teams up with USSR what about the Saudis and OPEC. England made big mistake on the oil deal Putinwill control
992 2018-07-16 21:48:12 Watching Nadiya's new cookery show.
Because I've been mainlining Lie To Me recently I'm primed to spot microexpressions. The olive oil guy has some REALLY interesting ones. And when I say interesting I mean creepily sexual. Yes, he's creepily sexual about olive oil.
993 2018-07-16 21:48:07 Stupid people shouldn't discuss weaponry.
994 2018-07-16 21:48:03 What a surprise. The owners of the Republican Party don’t want to be held responsible for oil and gas emissions. They claim to be ‘libertarians’, but don’t believe in humanity’s right not to breathe oil and gas emissions. They’re in their 80’s, they don’t care. Just the money.
995 2018-07-16 21:47:52 Bought my first batch of CBD oil today. I had a major panic attack lasting about 45 minutes earlier today pre-oil. Since the dosage, I don’t feel that post-attack hangover and my anxiety has subsided, even with the idiot Cheeto-in-chief trying to destroy the country.
996 2018-07-16 21:47:49 When I have the money -Deva curl no-poo shampoo and the conditioner that goes with it
But when I'm on a budget I use Giovanni Tea Tree shampoo and Aussi Moist conditioner then an almond oil, rose oil, and morrocan oil mix from Carol's Daughter finally La Bella gel
997 2018-07-16 21:47:42 Actually the executive branch ignored what the intelligence officials and the IAEA inspectors were saying and made up their own stories like what Trump is doing now because they wanted war for the oil. Trump just wants Putin’s 200 billion in oil money
998 2018-07-16 21:47:31 @HollyG56 told me to use avocado oil for spf and now I look like an oiled up pornstar
999 2018-07-16 21:47:28 Getting my oil changed and they’re not playing @1023nowradio... But they are playing @up993 and that works for me 
1000 2018-07-16 21:47:26 did I hear you say that the United States and Russia could control all the oil and LNG? What teamwork. Thats just what the world needs. What a pathetic, imbecilic lack of leadership.#PutinisTrumpsDaddy
1001 2018-07-16 21:47:13 Those #RussiaSanctions are in addition to @realDonaldTrump’s public tough talk – including landmark speech in Poland on European soil last year – openly lambasting Russia on using oil to hold NATO's Eastern European countries "hostage” during the winter months. #TrumpPutinSummit
1002 2018-07-16 21:47:00 That old , busted oil can doesn't want to end up the oldest prison wife in the history of the U.S. penal system.   That's why he's whining and crying now ; just wait until " BlockHead Bob " Mueller is forced to suspend his shame of an investigation LOL ... he'll piss himself !
1003 2018-07-16 21:46:53 Ah, but did it work? Did you find any Roman scrolls or tablets complaining that this is a waste of good oil? ;)
1004 2018-07-16 21:46:50 I want to know more about how this realization was finally achieved. Was an excess of IPAs involved in this moment of clarity? Was there fretting over some spilled artisanal beard oil? Or was shifting his bike on a hill the extent if it?
1005 2018-07-16 21:46:47 Oil price going to shits on the financial markets today fak me
1006 2018-07-16 21:46:38 I’m not saying she has, but the amount of big price winners she had caught my eye.  I’d follow her b4 the snake oil fav tipsters any day, way more enjoyment in a big price winner 
1007 2018-07-16 21:46:31 Gusto ko ng chix oil ng mang inasal tapos sinigang sabaw! Hmmm yum!
1008 2018-07-16 21:46:22 Brent crude oversold, expect a correction upwards over the next day or so. Trump want low oil for midterms
1009 2018-07-16 21:46:02 Which won’t be there to eat if you sell us to the highest bidder for oil.

1011 2018-07-16 21:45:44 Shouldn't have sold Wales up the river then, should he? Nothing more than a snake oil salesman. #sellout
1012 2018-07-16 21:45:42 He was crystal clear. You just feel dumb now that you fell for his snake oil salesman campaign two years ago. Deal with your and your party's "serious mistake".
1013 2018-07-16 21:45:39 Trump wants the billion in profits Putin promised him from oil He doesn't care about America, only increasing his wealth
1014 2018-07-16 21:45:22 Oh yeah, look up to Rockfellers of the oil industry.
1015 2018-07-16 21:45:16 Nobody ever wonders how Putin got so rich. On the radio today, somebody acted as if he got the money from being an oil magnate.
1016 2018-07-16 21:45:13 Epic!!! :)

It's only the palm nuts enemy who would see it be palm oil. The palm nut is happy being a palm nut.
1024 2018-07-16 21:44:37 Republicans cultivated an oil field of racism, homophobia, anti-intellectualism and hate over decades. Trump and Russia set it on fire. Trump alone couldn’t have won, not a chance.

Hillary was the most qualified AND unrelatable person to ever seek the office. She got robbed.
1025 2018-07-16 21:44:31 Hmmmmm....at NATO summit
"“I think it’s very sad when Germany makes a massive oil and gas deal with Russia, where you’re supposed to be guarding against Russia​..." Trump

How are you guarding Us against your buddy Putin @realDonaldTrump 
By bashing our intelligence agencies?
1026 2018-07-16 21:44:29 If black and brown ppl stopped selling, oil, gas, gold, uranium, bauxite, iron ore, rear earth, cobalt, just to name a few of the resources needed by western countries . How long would they last? asking for a friend.

1042 2018-07-16 21:42:28 Doughs are temperamental and it always depends on weather/humidity and how high above the sea level you are. But yeah, try again. Add olive oil instead of normal oul, add  fresh oregano/basil, whatever! Best of luck. Once you know how to do it you won't stop!

1048 2018-07-16 21:41:57 By growing fuel crops, farms can become self-sufficient.

There was a study in the 1980's, based in Southern Africa, that showed if a farm converted 10% of the farmland to growing sunflowers for making oil, they wouldn't need to buy fuel.
1049 2018-07-16 21:41:29 In testing with a 30C inlet, I was getting 50C oil outlet. This can easily be adjusted based on what you are trying to cook. I had an arduino set the temperature of the oil inlet through a PID controlling the heat exchanger fans’ speed.

1053 2018-07-16 21:40:53 But I though Rick Perry was smart now that he has glasses?    Under Obama, the head of Dept. of Energy had a Ph.D. In nuclear physics.   Perry has a 4 year degree in animal husbandry and thought Dept. of Energy was about oil. True story.

And not counting deaths from radiation is very, very much cheating. Like saying you shouldn't count the cost of oil slicks and sunk ships.
1058 2018-07-16 21:40:28 Watching @micahbrakefield live at my first BFL event & he's as slick as oil on the mat, no wonder this dude ran show in SUG! super cool to see another pro athlete from the valley #AsSeenOnTV #reppin #bfl @BattlefieldFL
1059 2018-07-16 21:40:15 This is ridiculous. @PremierScottMoe Do you understand the safety changes made to oil hauling cars. If they are so unsafe why do you allow them to cross the province. Never mind blocks from my house daily in Saskatoon. Also they are using more cars because of record production.
1060 2018-07-16 21:40:14 Maybe white males have a lot of money cos they are white males? I think ull find the "priveliged" rich ppl to be part of oil families who come from the middle East.

1070 2018-07-16 21:39:30 Yet China is and always has been the bigger threat to cyber security. Putin is a paper tiger. Come on, Germany is buying their oil and natural gas from Russia. It’s all bs.
1071 2018-07-16 21:39:18 He already imposed sanctions and expelled 60 diplomats. Now he’s trying to get Germany to cut off Putin’s money by not buying their oil. We also killed Russians in Syria. I guess you’d prefer outright war.
1072 2018-07-16 21:39:16 Which Russian commodity is Trump after? Oil? Aluminum? Gold? Silver? Making more money is always Trump's motivation. He's using the office of the Presidency to make some International heist. After he's done stabbing America and Europe in the back, he'll stab Putin in the back too
1073 2018-07-16 21:39:10 More like trump wants his place in every tyrannical blood money war that Putin has his hands on... oil, territory and profit is the driving force. Don’t be naive.
1074 2018-07-16 21:39:01 frying bacon in a pan should be an olympic sport like ur tryin not to get hot oil splattered all over u its hard man
1075 2018-07-16 21:38:59 Trump is far from Putin's poodle. Trump did say America will be competing with Russia on oil & gas & that America would become the biggest supplier of oil & gas. Does that sound like a Man whose someone's puppet?
1076 2018-07-16 21:38:21 Dogbone mount has been taking a beating, rather have that than the oil pan

1083 2018-07-16 21:37:30 I respect your clear anti-war stand. But your biases might be coming in here. Russia did interfere -but no proof Trump colluded. Trump is not dumb. He is giving Putin a chance to save face and giving him a hint that he wants to work with him on China,Energy(oil), middle east.

1104 2018-07-16 21:34:10 You do realize that the reason our infrastructure was falling to pieces was because of the failure of the previous gov’t to fund it even tho oil prices were sky high right? Or are you really that blindly partisan?
1105 2018-07-16 21:34:07 Trail of Tears comes to mind. Also GWBush scuttled America's future so he could invade a region and extradite its oil reserves and called it pursuing freedom

1107 2018-07-16 21:33:48 Very seriously considering selling my Scion TC.

It will need mechanical work in the future but at the present it runs and drives. Tires have good tread, engine runs smooth, AC blows VERY cold, still about 1000 miles left on the current oil change.

Asking $1600 OBO
1108 2018-07-16 21:33:38 Showered, put too much coconut oil in my hair and had to combat that with dry shampoo....  LOL
1109 2018-07-16 21:33:25 My oil light came on while I was on my way to work this morning... my brother found out, went & took it to get an oil change while I was at work. 

...I take back calling him a brat this morning. 
1110 2018-07-16 21:33:18 Most undocumented children in our schools are attending while their parents are picking your fruits and vegetables.  Without these people our farms would go fallow and we would be dependent on foreign food.  You think being dependent on foreign oil is bad?
1111 2018-07-16 21:33:13 The sensation when the tattoo artist rubs the cooling oil on after a lengthy drill simply can't be topped.
1112 2018-07-16 21:33:08 Sriracha - Really a must have, highly versatile and works with both western and asian cuisine
White truffle oil - Expensive but REALLY ups the natural flavors of things - Especially fries, even better if you have a dash of truffle salt on fries
BBQ - Smokey and sweet

1115 2018-07-16 21:33:03 He never mentioned oil independence, only independence from foreign oil. He did not broker the peace between Israel and Egypt, but only hosted the talks, after Sadat's visit to Israel and the agreement to negotiate a peace treaty, to provide the US blessing.
1116 2018-07-16 21:33:02 @JeffFlake If U& Ur colleagues think “it was a bad day for the country” why the hell then is the GOP being complicit watching our country’s integrity be flushed down the toilet by the snake oil salesmen Trump! Why Mr.Flake? Can U give a straight answer 2that?
1117 2018-07-16 21:32:57 Its shameful how Nigerian youths have exhibited lack of self esteem, discipline and decency ,how can you be paid to trend #NomoreBokoHaram when we all know the situation on ground, even though tremendous success has been recorded in decimating BH
1118 2018-07-16 21:32:36 The Argon Oil and Lavender has worked WONDERS on my corse, dry, frizzy THIN FROM POST PARTUM hair! I highly recommend it! It’s just an epic perk that it smells amazing and the smells linger.

1121 2018-07-16 21:32:24 Ah ok. It says he held a slave trading licence from the Royal Niger Company, but the RNC didn’t licence people to participate in the slave trade because it was long illegal in the UK by then and they were set up to trade palm oil etc.
1122 2018-07-16 21:32:19 That would wonders of oil!!! Gets any make up off... still using left over of the kids. I either don’t wear enough make up or this bottle is secretly getting topped up. Eldest child now 6 years old!

You go in for a cough and then find out you got cancer 
You go for an oil change and then find out the repairs cost more than the car

1125 2018-07-16 21:31:55 One oil change= a clogged filter that needs to be replaced and a nail in my tire.
1126 2018-07-16 21:31:54 All BRIC's Founders and satellite BRIC's Members should immediately call for a BRIC's Summit and each collectively call and approve the same China 25% tariff levied on all USA Crude Oil, and collectively increase their non-USD purchases of Iranian crude Oil.

1132 2018-07-16 21:31:08 @realDonaldTrump If you would like Republicans to fail in November, exempt some from the oil embargo. People watch everything and see your weakness clearly. The issue of Iran is important to everyone, if a country gets exempted from the oil embargo,

1137 2018-07-16 21:30:21 #TrumpPutinSummit Trump is what we call in my country "darkness in your home, oil lamp for the outsiders". He seems very submissive and positive to Putin and Kim, yet very combative and negative with his own folks.
1138 2018-07-16 21:30:20 Iran is a great example. The US & UK reinstated the Shah as absolute ruler when Mossadegh nationalized the country's oil industry. 20 years onwards, the Islamic revolution happens & now we're stuck with a klepto-theocracy which sponsors terrorism. 
1139 2018-07-16 21:30:18 @TheFive @realDonaldTrump Pres Trump did correct. Put your enemy at ease, Keep digging info on who-what-when-etc. Muller go interview the ones in Russia. Put results out for world to see. Shame Germany into dropping pipeline. Sell them our oil/gas at discount. VERY Smart @POTUS

1144 2018-07-16 21:29:47 Olive. You can build an ancient civilization with that shit.

You can hodl it for generations and it still maintains its value. You can mine it for oil! 

You pineapple shills are the Roger Ver of fruit! Wtf has pineapple done that olives can do?

Pizza? Are you fkn kidding me?
1145 2018-07-16 21:29:43 Apparently mct oil helps with making your body burn fat faster.  No idea how true it is but I'm started taking it.  I don't like putting a tablesoon in my mouth (yuck), so I'm putting it in veggie caps.
1146 2018-07-16 21:29:34 I mean, considering our entire country suffered under almost a decade of Reform politics, and Alberta wants an oil pipeline and damn the cost or consequences, I think I can be a little salty. Especially in a so alienated we don't even talk about it anymore region.
1147 2018-07-16 21:29:28 Could it have anything to do with all their liberal BS they have been pushing in their advertising?

1153 2018-07-16 21:28:11 Anyone ever stop to think that NATO largely has been involved in cleaning up after US involvement in keeping strategic interests around the world (namely oil). Makes sense that they should shoulder the burden of cost.

1168 2018-07-16 21:25:28 Russia did interfere - there is consensus on that, but no proof Trump colluded. Trump is not dumb. He is giving Putin a chance to save face and giving him a hint that he wants to work with on China,Energy(oil) security for west, middle east and muslim hardline groups. Am I naive?

1191 2018-07-16 21:21:50 The reality of today’s Russia is that aside from its military prowess and oil, it’s a dying empire whose fringes would be in open revolt except for cruel suppression. Its population is declining. No one buys its goods.  The system is kleptocratic. Its currency is a joke.

1227 2018-07-16 21:18:28 @nathanking Thank you for your CGTN reporting on Trump-Putin. Did anyone in press conference ask if they discussed: 1) possible u.s. oil projects in Russia; 2) Trump family projects in Russia; 3) Trump trademarks in Russia?

1230 2018-07-16 21:18:11 How r we more vulnerable? Have Russian players been sent home? Sanctions still n place? Is he poking Germany 4 buying Russian oil? What wud tough rhetoric hav accomplished today? Keep friends close; enemies closer. I trust Trump much more than u lifetime politicians.
1231 2018-07-16 21:18:11 Sorry, Loreal short beard oil is the one for me. Maybe next time eh 
1232 2018-07-16 21:18:09 Trump has not disgraced us. We can't take a hard line with Russia - we fell behind in the cold war during Obama and their weapons are superior. Also, their new oil pipeline can destroy our dollar and economy until we develop our own resources.
1233 2018-07-16 21:18:00 @frankienbennys why oh why did you shelve the #cinnamonwafflecrunch and replace it with the disgusting new #waffle range had to send mine back was revolting, can still taste the veg oil yuck #bringbackcinnamonwaffle
1234 2018-07-16 21:17:58 I’m the last one here for my oil change everyone has come and gone WHY AM I STILL HERE.
1235 2018-07-16 21:17:55 I make pita chips and eat them with tofu spread or hummus. Just split a pita open so you have 2 rounds, slice them in triangles, put olive oil on them, a blend of curry powder, paprika and poppy seeds sprinkled on top. 5-6 minutes at 350 F in the oven :D super good
1236 2018-07-16 21:17:47 Ha! See previous tweet. I had a massive pile of peppers, courgettes, tomatoes and mushrooms. Quick cook in olive oil, pesto, bit of wholewheat pasta. Sounds v healthy but isn’t really!

1238 2018-07-16 21:17:31 They make a mess while they're still operational. I've seen big oil leaks coming out of some of them near Palm Springs. And in northern California, they act like big blenders and turn endangered condors into clouds of feathers and coyote chow. Fun times!
1239 2018-07-16 21:17:29 Man I will buy the dip definitely
1240 2018-07-16 21:17:05 Beauty World is packed today. I only came in here for beard oil 
1241 2018-07-16 21:17:05 Washed my human hair wig... it‘s not caucasian hair let me tell you that, I was not prepared for the poof.
I am still not prepared for the poof. Anyone know how to get it straight & glossy again? Already tried oil 
1242 2018-07-16 21:16:53 I believe she was appointed to the position by Notley so to give her inside knowledge of the oil industry so she can use that info against the industry today while protesting.
1243 2018-07-16 21:16:35 So you and your rich buddies can kill all the poor people and take over the planet? 

Nuke everyone who doesn’t agree with your nationalist agenda? Maybe just nuke the Middle East and steal all the oil? 

Turn away our KNOWN allies & turn America in a third world country?
1244 2018-07-16 21:16:28 As hot as it is i still gotta lotion & oil up i cant go out like that lol
1245 2018-07-16 21:16:27 In fairness though, Feaster didn't help himself by saying Jankowski could be the best player in the draft lol. That was like adding oil to the fire.
1246 2018-07-16 21:16:22 Crackheads will change your oil, fix your breaks, and wash your car & only charge you $20
1247 2018-07-16 21:16:21 mix your gels with oil so they don’t flake.
1248 2018-07-16 21:15:55 If I say ‘show me a good restaurant’ I’m expecting a hole in the wall family cooking joint. Not a flowers all over the wall and an overuse of truffle oil. Get out of my face.
1249 2018-07-16 21:15:52 there are schedules releases out to 2023 set forth in 2015 ...if they decide to release anything additional it will be irrelevant imho
1250 2018-07-16 21:15:48 Using some ‘Rosemary and Olive Deep Cleansing Oil’ on my face just now, it felt (and smelled) like basting the meat 
1251 2018-07-16 21:15:45 Check your Transmission oil this morning.
1252 2018-07-16 21:15:42 I would love to hear how the NDP is walking away from all the horrible things created by the oil and gas industry. What have you fine people personally given up? Vehicles? Food grown on comercial farms? Say it proud, NDP. Thank you.
1253 2018-07-16 21:15:31 no but rlly, wear as little clothes as possible, get your hands on some peppermint oil if you can and spray yourself with water and mint. it'll help your body cool better
1254 2018-07-16 21:15:23 Getting this oil change before I head back to the north side
1255 2018-07-16 21:15:15 This m50 motor is real cool except i really nees to do the valve cover gasket cuz we're straight pissin oil at this point
1256 2018-07-16 21:15:06 I remember you talking about CBD oil.  Is there a brand you prefer?
1257 2018-07-16 21:14:51 I swear all day everyday your upsold Like your dog gunna die without this shampoo, your car will explode without this special oil, your cheese on that burger will cost $2 more....
1258 2018-07-16 21:14:40 I pay $30 for similar ones. Each joint is a half eight, rolled with half gram oil, dipped in hash oil, and then rolled in kief. I’m guessing this is similar
1259 2018-07-16 21:14:36 Do you use anything for ur lashes like coconut oil to grow faster?
1260 2018-07-16 21:14:31 & public sector. Nobody doubts the dedication of NHS staff, but be sure "even" Civil Servants would be working weekends - if they had clear direction!

That white paper, impossible to implement though it be, must've burnt a lot of midnight oil, with so many conflicts to resolve.
1261 2018-07-16 21:14:28 Trump had the opportunity to sort Saudi out last year but instead of becoming Saudi's enemy he sold $350 billion worth of goods and ensured Iran suffered in exchange. Shameful - Trump became a prostitute to them and since those orders announced oil has surged except recently.
1262 2018-07-16 21:14:22 .@SFTEBakery If you don't care enough about orangutans and rainforests to stop using palm oil, think of the revenue you lose from sweetaholics who truly care and will not buy anything with #PalmOil
1263 2018-07-16 21:14:19 Not that obsessed about protein as I was. Nuts have fats yes, but I do eat avocados regularly. We cook with olive oil too. 
I am still thinking I should go grab a vitb12 supplement, I'll find one that just needs to be taken once a week. Haven't had my levels checked or anything.
1264 2018-07-16 21:14:13 I had a pump failure that leaked oil throughout hydro system during flowering the entire crop of 5 foot tall pure skunk plants choked out and died.....so draggy..
1265 2018-07-16 21:14:06 That’s pretty nifty!!!
1266 2018-07-16 21:14:03 Do you actually think they will release the spr ? Don you think the domestic oil producers have some form of lobbying to prevent it ?
1267 2018-07-16 21:14:02 I wasn’t sure myself  I thought oil was mostly from trees and plant material, but happy to go with your expertise if the meme is correct.
1268 2018-07-16 21:14:02 This is not really THE issue, but am curious if oil prices were discussed at Trump-Putin love fest. Putin wants higher prices; Trump needs lower prices well before Nov election. #oil
1269 2018-07-16 21:13:57 Since I’ve gotten a hybrid I feel so lost when I go to check my water and oil and I would do my own oil change before but is it the same?? I’m so confused
1270 2018-07-16 21:13:51 “Our Lord’s anointing by the Spirit inaugurates the kingdom in power, but the oil drips down his neck to his entire body, anointing all of his people, beginning at Pentecost”

1272 2018-07-16 21:13:38 @pepboysauto it never ceases to amaze me that everytime I come to this location and make an appointment it’s a 1.5-2 hr wait for an oil change is ridiculous in my compact car. Like literally what is the point I’ve showed up without an appointment and it’s the same if not longer! – bij Pep Boys Auto Parts & Service

1275 2018-07-16 21:13:13 University teams and minor football could use it. How about Irving Oil getting involved. Saw their logo on the wall of Fenway Park. They can give something back.
1276 2018-07-16 21:13:02 lol...but clearly copper and Cobalt are the places to be in Q3/Q4 especially after a damp squib in the oil small caps...so much for an oil fest....Not a single oil drill on time...
1277 2018-07-16 21:12:57 Thanks to Texas, U.S. shale oil output forecast to climb by 143,000 barrels a day in August. #txenergy, #EIA.
1278 2018-07-16 21:12:55 The most valuable minerals and oil are all in africa but is western countries, usa and china that benefot from them. Why is that? This is the same as your parents leave all their money to one child and when the other childern want to eat, they have to beg :-( capitalism...
1279 2018-07-16 21:12:33 Canada and USA planned to try to have puppet rule Russia and have him privatize the oil industry of Russia and sell it to Canadian and US oil companies. This plan almost worked but it didn’t. So why’s Russian politics corrupted? Because America meddle in their politics first.
1280 2018-07-16 21:12:06 As I was leaving for Oregon this morning, my car decided to be a lil bitch and say I needed an oil change even though I JUST GOT AN OIL CHANGE ON FRIDAY. Now I’m back home and sad af. 
1281 2018-07-16 21:11:45 A small agency with a big job, indeed: the job of betraying the American people, and the wildlife and lands you are tasked with protecting...in partnership w/ corporate and private profiteers in the cattle ranching, & oil/mining industries. Every day is your BETRAYAL-day, #BLM.
1282 2018-07-16 21:11:43 tea tree oil! it smells nasty but the mosquitoes hate it too (most of the time). maybe mix it with some water and spray it around your windows and doors and/or on yourself when you leave the house
1283 2018-07-16 21:11:43 So Putin can STRONGLY Deny interfering with our Election but Trump can't stand by the Secret Service Agencies? Who's R President? Trump or Putin! Putin said so much in this meeting like Governments Should Regulate oil & gas! No Push Back from Trump! Putin is really our President!
1284 2018-07-16 21:11:36 She’s a robot. She got oil pressure.
1285 2018-07-16 21:11:34 Yes. Olive oil - NO. Must include shaking the boiled potatoes so they smash a bit. Then goosefat. There is no other way.
1286 2018-07-16 21:11:30 You can use a moisturizer..cleanse-tone-Moisturize -apply luxe oil then SPF :)
1287 2018-07-16 21:11:23 I would also hope that Coconut oil and  pure olive oils and avacado are your healthy fat sources. Not seed oils.

I beleive a vegetarian to vegan diet CAN be near non damaging.... IF proper nutrition is reached for. no sugar & most grains are kept to a minimum & Suppliments used
1288 2018-07-16 21:11:14 I ate spaghetti and olive oil with parmesan cheese and now my throat is itchy.
1289 2018-07-16 21:11:12  Imo, the bigger problem would be the same one fish oil supplement manufacturers face—the n-3 PUFAs in supplements oxidize over time such that most brands contain:
1. A fraction of the n-3 PUFAs indicated on the label
2. Oxidation products with unknown long-term health effects
1290 2018-07-16 21:11:11 Basically they not only hacked the election but have first approval on tRump appointees No surprise on Rex Tillerson. : Exxon-Rosneft, $500 billion oil deal in 2012 (which Obama kiboshed). I knew that was a set up. Thankfully it didn’t work out like Putin planned....yet.
1291 2018-07-16 21:11:10 I made $20+ in tips today and instead of buying clothes i have to be an adult and get my oil changed. 
1292 2018-07-16 21:11:06 Last nite I layed my crown on my lil sweetie’s lap and she massaged my scalp with oil  I was at peace
1293 2018-07-16 21:10:56 Honestly a little bit of a thinner oil with a silk scarf
1294 2018-07-16 21:10:42 Lol not really crayfish tastes nice in anything cooked with palm oil
1295 2018-07-16 21:10:38 .@Free2bFoods There is no such thing as sutainable palm oil. Please use a planet friendly, orang-utan, tiger, elegant & rhino friendly oil - especially if you want to market to vegans and eco-conscious people
1296 2018-07-16 21:10:27 Sigo. No es argenitna TS. Pero miren de re ojo al oil. Si quiebra a la baja los 66 hay q salir de TS o tomar ganancia parcialmente.
1297 2018-07-16 21:10:18 Crude oil is made up of fossilized plants and animals, and that's what's used in the manufacturing of plastics.

Whatever happened to that extra virgin olive oil he was selling made from expired Greek olives?

1301 2018-07-16 21:09:57 Hi.Use Rosehip luxe pure oil as your daily facial moisturizer accompanied by SPF, at all times and use the Lemon Brightening "Overnight" Serum daily at night after cleansing.
1302 2018-07-16 21:09:49 Or they’re co-compromised. Who knows what oil tankers full of #GOP sludge the Russians could leak if they chose?
1303 2018-07-16 21:09:31 Okay, so our government has also done unbelievable evil in removing us from gold-backed dollar and making our dollar depend on Middle Eastern oil agreements (Nixon). Until we develop our own supply, we have to keep doing evil there to hold up our economy. I'm outraged about this.
1304 2018-07-16 21:09:23 Alas the mea culpa of snake oil politicians lost against the roil swell of a turning tide.
1305 2018-07-16 21:09:20 It was absolutely brilliant, so many recipes to have a go at, and the people you met were all so interesting. I wish the olive oil man had been tested with the rapeseed oil!
1306 2018-07-16 21:09:14 Hope you are patient wait to see what happens. He didn’t back down on sanctions Ukraine or Crimea stayed the US is the worlds biggest supplier of oil.  Would you refer he provoke Russia into War?  US intelligence did fail in 2016. Hang tough! @JoeWalsh
1307 2018-07-16 21:09:04 So was the chastising of Angela Markel and saying we are going to get those contracts was this about oil.  trump putin play to renew efforts for Exxon deal $500 billion  just a poorly worded query  #CartoonVillains #POTUSIs Dimwitted @realDonaldTrump
1308 2018-07-16 21:09:03 Of course they did. The GOP looks at Russia as #SquadGoals  a majority white "Christian" nation under the rule of oil barons. Oh AND they get to openly persecute LGBTQ community for fun.
1309 2018-07-16 21:08:55 @Tonevays check out oil looks like it’s gonna get a 9 tommorow.
1310 2018-07-16 21:08:52 Do u know that, african countries have all, of the most valuables minerals and oil but is europe, usa and china who exploid them and keep the profits. Not nice!
1311 2018-07-16 21:08:44 I don't even remember the last time my coconut oil was liquid.
1312 2018-07-16 21:08:41 Big Wife Energy will end our dependence on gulf oil
1313 2018-07-16 21:08:05 I just want to say shaving with baby oil was the best shaving experience of my life.
1314 2018-07-16 21:07:57 YESSSSSSSS!!!
1315 2018-07-16 21:07:52 Why oil prices are suddenly tanking  - CNNMoney. Once again you can ppl prove your stupidity by not understanding that Trump's policies work. You also do not like that FACT in any way !
1316 2018-07-16 21:07:51 And the fucking magaturds are saying “world peace world peace” and “ the EU is taking oil from Russia and  still want our help to fight russia” . 

Fuck trump
1317 2018-07-16 21:07:40 I would recommend a nice coconut oil. I think it would really help your complexion.

1321 2018-07-16 21:06:55 I have both the rosehip oil serum & the lemon brightening one as recommended by staff at Plush - should I be using them as a moisturizer or should I still be using a moisturizer with them?
1322 2018-07-16 21:06:51 After the attack on Pearl Harbor, FDR says both sides have been foolish. There will be no military retaliation, but US will increase oil and gas sales to the Empire of Japan.

1328 2018-07-16 21:06:10 stock market hit by oil fears
1329 2018-07-16 21:06:09 Cambridge has Russian ties through universities and oil companies.
1330 2018-07-16 21:05:44 Well, what a state of affairs, our leader is shutting the shop early when she should be burning the midnight oil, and as for Trump, well, He’s fucking nuts.
1331 2018-07-16 21:05:43 Oh, & Trump's giving Putin what he needs most--oil pricing > $50/bbl so he can keep his economy going.
1332 2018-07-16 21:05:43 lmfao it’s the oil
1333 2018-07-16 21:05:33 @TeamCavuto Your Common Sense comments were at very least condescending and inappropriate, as you suggested what @POTUS said about incompetent prior Administrations, it’s all true, as it was true of what he said about the EU. Imagine Germany buying gas and oil from...Russia!
1334 2018-07-16 21:05:29 Take a look at the new 2019 Ram 1500’s, nice trucks.
1335 2018-07-16 21:05:24 Really interested in this CBD oil and maybe being able to replace my anxiety meds with it  I sure hope so
1336 2018-07-16 21:05:24 when they sent it too you after you just paid for the oil change 
1337 2018-07-16 21:05:10 Oh no. I didn't forget shake. But yes, it's the most important bit. Larger surface area to absorb the oil and go crispy.
1338 2018-07-16 21:04:57 Use coconut oil on a cotton swab and it'll come off easy! We also have a vegan version that is more user friendly 
1339 2018-07-16 21:04:49 Except for one minor detail.  She works for the globalist's who not only planned to overthrow 6 countries, including Iraq, Libya, etc but also Russia.   For their extensive gas, oil & rare Earth minerals.
1340 2018-07-16 21:04:41 FYI: Blackseed oil, Oregano oil, Neem and Spurilina should be in your everyday usage.
1341 2018-07-16 21:04:24 Yes, our fault by allowing our governments to cause havoc, in countries that have, rich minerals and oil. Ok for the chinese to come ?
1342 2018-07-16 21:04:14 my sisters baby has baby acne, which is really common. 

she won't even let me put tea tree oil on it!
she won't even let me give him a little clay mask!
not even just on his t-zone!

"it's a baby", she says, "he is literally just days old."
1343 2018-07-16 21:03:53 @TeamCavuto You think the Germans are clean buying oil from the guy we are going in debt to defend them from. You think he is going to trust the intelligence agencies that have been trying to destroy him for years? Good luck with that!
1344 2018-07-16 21:03:53 Thank goodness for Eye Brightening Cream today..... gives me that #MondayMotivation I need to make it till bed time! Get a free Clearly Coconut Oil when you buy Hello Glow (feat. Eye Brightening Cream & Healthy Glow Facial Hydrator)
1345 2018-07-16 21:03:28 i guess they prefer a raw egg and coconut oil because they’re stuck up and spoiled
1346 2018-07-16 21:03:13 Ce ne sont pas des problèmes de riches mais le problème de tous : le peak oil a déclenché le redéploiement de l’empire en Irak et en Libye. Cela nous concerne tous.
1347 2018-07-16 21:03:10 Idk why I am compelled to confirm that I am mildly allergic to Olive oil every chance I get but I sure do it every time
1348 2018-07-16 21:03:03 "why aren't millenials eating more rancid fish oil!?"
1349 2018-07-16 21:03:02 You can get a weed card to but  the oil is a prescribed thing that you don't need a MMC  for
1350 2018-07-16 21:02:59 Peppermint oil! Keeps them away
1351 2018-07-16 21:02:56 I agree. Servers are not up to performance. Sounds like the network guys still don’t know how to configure a fully redundant high compute network. Amazon should give me a call I used to do it for large scale networks in the oil and gas industry.

1356 2018-07-16 21:01:54 Lol I'm finally getting somewhere with doctors and stuff, so there's hope. I've heard that before too about the oil. Maybe one day
1357 2018-07-16 21:01:52 Let’s see which of your buddies gets the first oil lease.
1358 2018-07-16 21:01:52 Jetpack technology exists, but the reptiles hoard it for themselves! Nuclear power is making dolphins violent! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
1359 2018-07-16 21:01:49 That's my biggest gripe. 

Boil almost to collapse in salted water
Shake
Olive oil and veg oil mix
200 degree oven with salt. Baste frequently and ensure plenty of space around each one.

Perfect everyone.
1360 2018-07-16 21:01:38 C'mon man, don't they have some oil you want? Seriously though, we should be about a step away from war with Russia after their continued cyber-attacks, not sucking Putin's dick behind closed doors. Prove to me that he didn't do that while he was there.
1361 2018-07-16 21:01:33 Castor oil and MPL oil
1362 2018-07-16 21:01:25 Where do you get Jamaican castor oil
1363 2018-07-16 21:01:21 Yes, pea protein and canola oil instead of animal protein and fat.  Garbage.
1364 2018-07-16 21:01:18 Two slices of pizza are the equivalent to swallowing 3 spoons of warm oil. Do you feel like eating pizza now?
1365 2018-07-16 21:01:02 Ya know I don’t think a pee tape. He could survive that. Look what he already has survived. I think it’s money...lots and lots of money. Money laundering, oil money, and human trafficking money. A few possible things he could dangling from Putin’s leash.
1366 2018-07-16 21:01:00 I know how weird this is, but I really need an oil painter so if you know anybody tell them to hit me up!

1368 2018-07-16 21:00:47 I'll guarantee my career, income, education, assets dwarf yours. This is why most red states are poor while blue states control most tech, law, media, finance, universities and high property values. We pay the nation's bills. You people dig holes for oil. Just say thank you
1369 2018-07-16 21:00:46 Bernie, you and I both know that Putin is far less of a threat to US “democracy” than the military industrial complex, CIA, NSA, Wall Street, multinational corporations, Big Pharma, private prison industry, Big Oil, NRA, Saudi Arabia, FBI, etc.

Agree that Trump is an idiot.
1370 2018-07-16 21:00:38 They said my next oil change appointment I'll have to get a bunch of shit and I legit hate being a big girl lol
1371 2018-07-16 21:00:36 Don’t worry about a thing because every little thing is gonna be alright!!!
1372 2018-07-16 21:00:35 The leftover stirfry i made has potatoes, field roast, garlic, teriyaki sauce, rainbow chard, carrots, red onion, and corn.

I wrapped them in eggroll wrappers and  fried them in grapeseed oil.
1373 2018-07-16 21:00:35 I know I’ve tweeted a lot in the past 20 minutes but my fav skincare hack as a combination skin tomato face is using @StrippedSkinUK lavender eye makeup remover all over my skin to balance the oil and reduce redness. Extra props for the eyelash growth as well.

1378 2018-07-16 21:00:20 They, especially the oil executives and refinery owners, really like how he and Putin work together to guarantee oil dependency by penalizing the use of renewable energy.
1379 2018-07-16 21:00:18 July 16, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1380 2018-07-16 21:00:17 Fry on 400 for about 5-7 mins. Spray with the olive oil lightly. Season how you like. I used onion garlic powder salt and a little mrs dash

1382 2018-07-16 21:00:08 @bastilledan so..few days ago a girl asked on twitter "what do you guys hear" at the beginning of "Oil On Water"??...and everytime i hear "Hey,I think i'm sick" ...so...what she actually say?..I wanna know 
1383 2018-07-16 21:00:08 During Obama admin we fell behind in the cold war. Russia has far superior weapons to us.

Our $USD is no longer backed by gold but by our Middle East oil agreements. Russia's new oil pipeline undermines these and can destroy our dollar.

Can't play hardball with Russia right now
1384 2018-07-16 21:00:07 He literally tried to poach oil business from Russia right in front of Putin, yet we are to believe he is in Putins pocket.  To Trump admitting "interference" is the same as admitting "collusion". and we know the media would report it that way.

1387 2018-07-16 21:00:00 Our full spectrum hemp oil is extracted from organic industrial hemp grown in Colorado, using the pharmaceutical-grade ethanol process to distill the active ingredients. This is further refined into our full spectrum hemp extract which provides a wide-range of beneficial

1389 2018-07-16 20:59:36 Love this stuff! I just add a few drops of facial oil to it. #promua
1390 2018-07-16 20:59:33 olive oil, sesame seeds and garlic before grill, sesame oil to finish when off the grill
1391 2018-07-16 20:59:23 this actually has nothing to do with Queens Park, its due to a big oil prince drop
1392 2018-07-16 20:59:16 neil cavuto
You think the Germans are clean buying Oil from the same people we are supposed going into debt to defend? You think the intelligence communities have been fair to POTUS. Wake up!
1393 2018-07-16 20:58:56 Pony. I've been a big fan of the BBC it used 2 wake me up in the morning. I just can't stomach it anymore. U give a platform 2 snake oil salesmen. That's not balance, that's balls & it sells the UK short. Next renewal, I'm cancelling my licence. Netflix do better made up stuff.
1394 2018-07-16 20:58:48 Your scary guns have made him feel all fainthearted. Sad!
1395 2018-07-16 20:58:32 I think in geopolitical terms it IS a competitor, in economic perhaps not but Id not write off those natural assets they posses oil & gas etc
1396 2018-07-16 20:58:28 I have no idea what you are talking about. The conversation I was having about 5 months ago has changed direction a hundred times. NEVER have I talked about Venezuela, OPEC or any other oil country or even the financial affairs of other countries.
1397 2018-07-16 20:58:07 I hope New York and California- two biggest Dem states are paying attention. I may trade them both to Russia for 100 years of free natural gas and oil from Russia. Republicans will always be able to get elected! This is better for America than overrated Louisiana Purchase!
1398 2018-07-16 20:58:05 Only choose a Toyota if you want reliability, high resell value, and a great time everywhere you go.


1399 2018-07-16 20:57:57 Lol dont go to Baiyrd for oil change. Ive been here since 2 and still havent gotten my car back. Now gonna be late for work because of an oil change i couldve done myself in 20 minutes
1400 2018-07-16 20:57:51 If you want a job in the oil field let me know we’re hiring
1401 2018-07-16 20:57:39 With more than 6000 products made from oil and gas not to mention the hundreds of thousands of homes that use oil or gas for heat and we haven't even talked about the millions of vehicles on the road, oil and gas are going nowhere. Better we build a pipeline to sell it.
1402 2018-07-16 20:57:35 im gonna start my big oil painting tomorrow oof....
1403 2018-07-16 20:57:15 And it tasted good just “spraying” oil? Also which temperature?
1404 2018-07-16 20:57:10 If the oil companies or oligarchs, good, not the Russian people.
1405 2018-07-16 20:57:10 Been sitting in a coffee house in Virginia all day working. Apparently this is the place to come when you give your Essential Oil presentations!
1406 2018-07-16 20:57:06 I'm still learning to balance this, especially with eggplant that sucks all of the oil up. I don't want super greasy food, but I also want it to be delicious and crispy.
1407 2018-07-16 20:57:05 Whatever floats ur boat.  I used to be in construction sales lol before I did this
1408 2018-07-16 20:56:55 Yeah right. By strengthening NATO? Exporting more oil? Stepping up in Syria and Iran? Pressuring Germany to cancel the Russian pipeline?

You guys just say general BS hoping no one ever calls you out on it. Sad!
1409 2018-07-16 20:56:41 15. Opened up Anwar for oil drilling
16. Opened coal mines and now for the first time America produces more energy than it uses and is a net exporter.
17. Has withdrawn from the Paris Accord, which was blatantly unfair and saved U.S. taxpayer millions of dollars

1410 2018-07-16 20:56:31 I came in this dealership for a 40 dollar oil change and now here I am, spending close to 300 smh lol
1411 2018-07-16 20:56:31 #PrimeDay2018 is so addicting, like a damn game.

Why did I buy an electric trolling motor even tho I don’t own a boat? Because deals.

Do I need a 100 count krill oil pills? No clue.  But deals.
1412 2018-07-16 20:56:30 Oh please. Trump could end support for the genocide today & oil wouldn’t be touched. The Saudis militarily can only do what we allow them to do
1413 2018-07-16 20:56:27 Meanwhile trump has doubled the barrel of oil?

How many of you condemn that?

1417 2018-07-16 20:55:51 But I've been told by reliable sources that our paleo ancestors were eating broccoli and coconut oil.

1424 2018-07-16 20:54:56 Well, be careful.  ABB is a smart-grid company.  Oil firms could jeopardize public charging networks with exorbitant pricing, shutting them down or making them hard to use.  Electric distribution companies will be more interested in selling their own 'fuel'.
1425 2018-07-16 20:54:36 The oil warning light came on so we called the only contact and we were advised to immediately take the car to Nashville airport.
1426 2018-07-16 20:54:31 U think we buy oil from Iran???? How ridiculous are you???? THIS is why talking with a far left liberal is such a waste of time. Sad.....and stupid
1427 2018-07-16 20:54:26 President Trump speaks on how much Oil and Natural Gas we have in the United States. However, how do the companies get the gas and oil to ports for export when the left wing wackos keep blocking the pipelines?
1428 2018-07-16 20:54:20 Most all US oil today is from North America. Biggest oil importers for the US are Canada and Mexico.
1429 2018-07-16 20:54:20 Man; tons of opportunities for those who can innovate I would say. I thought flower was end all until I tried oil, and I assume this *WOW* element from a consumer standpoint will be there with further innovations such as infused beverages. It's crazy....
1430 2018-07-16 20:54:17 Bush had TIES to Saudi oil, actual and literally TIES through his family and gets RE-ELECTED, 6k Americans killed, 100k Iraqis, the war exposed as a fraud, we never end it, we expand it and renew every single one of his policies - but Trump winks at Putin and thats the treason?
1431 2018-07-16 20:54:17 Yes but that was about the King bc No-1776-bama (and probably the Pope bc scary cathlics)
1432 2018-07-16 20:54:16 @realDonaldTrump  Mr President  I know you are a very busy Man   But I would ask you to look into the price gauging  the oil company's are doing to us   You open up the pipe line and Alaska  why is the price of gas  $3.05  a gallon ? maybe you can ask them why
1433 2018-07-16 20:54:15 Capitalism>Romance
1434 2018-07-16 20:54:09 Putin is sitting on a bunch of oil he can't sell! Bet Trump will pay through the nose for it! You know spread all this free US Government  $$$ around!

Thanks TJ, from all the boyz (including Deltoid Dave) down at Clean Jerk, depths of Kent- P.s what oil do you use?

1442 2018-07-16 20:53:21 Yep!  And Big Oil paid millions of dollars for the "patent on a carburetor which allowed their engines to get over 100 mpg".  It used to be difficult to dispel those false rumors, now it's easy to look up patents on the internet!

1449 2018-07-16 20:52:41 Why do we allow Donald Trump to fly around the world colluding with dictators that he admires?

Today Donald Trump is meeting in private with Vladimir Putin!

Donald Trump wants to get rid of the EPA and lift sanctions against Russia, so that they can drill for oil in the Arctic.
1450 2018-07-16 20:52:38 I mean to be frank, you literally said Justin Trudeau buys oil. That’s a lie, Bill. Is the bible open to interpretation?

1478 2018-07-16 20:49:15 If you are taking meds from pharmacy then it should be continuosly used for like 2 weeks. If you do treatment they can gain resistance. If its severe consult a skin specialist. Further tree oil and ceratin other oil can be used but bettr go doc 
Alternatively you can try cupping.

1495 2018-07-16 20:47:43 The poor mattered but so did the oil industry which Chavez neglected. 
He stopped investing in equipment. Soon production dropped , his socialist dream vanished, it ran out of money.
1496 2018-07-16 20:47:33 The @GOP wants mass shootings so the NRA will give them $$$, they sabotage the ACA so insurance companies will give them $$$, they deny climate change so oil companies will give them &&&, & they will try to sweep #TreasonSummit under the rug b/c Russia is now their only hope.
1497 2018-07-16 20:47:23 My hair was so damaged last year. I really learned how to take care of it myself. JOJOBA oil is a blessing. Leave your hair wet, braid it up, put the oil at your ends/ edges. Throw on a scarf & watch yo shit grow.

1513 2018-07-16 20:45:11 Canada is built on oil and gas. Every Canadian uses oil and gas either in the products they consume (arrived on a truck) or directly in the vehicles they drive. No amount of wishing will change that. But crippling the industry will destroy our economy. So... Seems short sighted.

1521 2018-07-16 20:44:16 Know what I don’t get? Just last week you bad-mouthed Germany for getting oil from Russia. (Btw, the % you claimed was wrong.) But that’s not the point. The point is, your brain is non-existent. You’re a puppet. You can’t change your mind every few days. So what’s it gonna be?

1523 2018-07-16 20:43:57 it’s utilities and oil companies doing that already in Europe. On top they are the ones investing in new fast ev charger networks alongside car manufacturers. BP just bought a big one in the UK.

1530 2018-07-16 20:42:57 The German Foreign Office tweeted - In 2017 only 24% of Germanys energy consumption was gas, 40% came from Russia. That means 9,6% of Russian gas in the overall consumption. If we add oil from Russia the total share is 23%, still far from 70% @GERonEconomy - 23% is still big
1531 2018-07-16 20:42:47 Wow, Faux Noise # Fox reporting on oil prices, gone down I guess that’s supposed to be a consolation? Every American Should Be Outraged Today with Trumps Action
1532 2018-07-16 20:42:47 Just woke up from a nap to find a dude staring into the front door. I said, ‘What’s up.’ He said he was walking to get two cans of oil, and did I have an umbrella he could borrow. What would he have done if I wasn’t right inside on the sofa?

1551 2018-07-16 20:40:17 Because your average voter doesn't give a shit.   Biggest move Trump made in the last week was letting Oil importers buy oil from Iran (lowering the cost of oil $3/barrel).  As Chris Rock said on your show, "brothers care about the price of gas".

1571 2018-07-16 20:38:42 This is a moment of great opportunity for @cnni. The shabbiness of the Trump presidency reveals that the concept of ‘leader of the free world’ has always been ridiculous. The leader of a free world would not have as best friends dictators, even with oil. You never had the job.
1572 2018-07-16 20:38:18 Lol. That’s not “the Left.” And if you count throwing oil prices sky high - which makes Russia rich and losing soybeans sales - also makes Russia rich... he is winning all right, but for the wrong team!
1573 2018-07-16 20:38:01 It was all planed years ago. They just want to grub the Oil and Natural gas so they had to destroy the Greek economy to make us weak and depented from them. They have Putin on their backs and wnat to get rid of him.

1616 2018-07-16 20:33:20 I don't, but this has given Putin the green light to poison more people on foreign shores, create more trouble in the Middle East to secure high oil prices and attempt more hacking. Crimea didn't want to fight the Ruskies either

1626 2018-07-16 20:32:23 Dear @gmail, just because I live in a state where pot is legal doesn't mean that all the CBD oil emails I get aren't spam. Thanks.
1627 2018-07-16 20:32:23 God damnit.
1628 2018-07-16 20:32:19 Under current law, DOJ can't stop OPEC & its members from coordinating oil production to manipulate prices & supply, driving up fuel costs for Americans at the pump. Sen. Klobuchar's NOPEC Act w/ @ChuckGrassley will help ensure that U.S. gas prices are fair & affordable
1629 2018-07-16 20:32:18 Wait, what?

*breaks out the iPhone*
1630 2018-07-16 20:32:13 Also good to use with olive oil and butter when sauteeing things like shrimp or scallops.

1633 2018-07-16 20:32:04 Phew, we dodged a bullet! All Putin had to do was tell Trump that there was a safety recall on Alaska (leaking oil), and that he would offer the US a full refund, but only because Donald is such a master negotiator, and we'd be down to 49 states :( #treason #TrumpPutinSummit

1638 2018-07-16 20:31:24 Thinking of starting a mobile windshield repair business and branching out into non-mechanic services (like a/c recharge, car detailing, wiper replacement) and possibly very basic work under the hood (like oil changes and tune ups). Does anyone have any insight or advice? …
1639 2018-07-16 20:31:13 As a side note your interview with Saddam Hussein before the for oil war stated . It will go down in world history as truth in reporting , that was the real reason . The network let you go for it !!!

1646 2018-07-16 20:30:52 The MSM proved my point. ExxonMobil Russia (Rockefeller's) are leveraging Sanctions & black marketing Russian oil/gas illegally. If our relations with Russia normalize: they lose their criminal monopoly!!

1657 2018-07-16 20:29:39 If you're honestly surprised by Trump's comments, I know of some snake oil you might be interested in buying if this god damn amazon prime day ever starts working.
1658 2018-07-16 20:29:29 I didn’t know vitamin C was a form of snake oil 
1659 2018-07-16 20:29:28 No, Norway was self sufficient prior to oil being found in their zone.  Consequently they could, and did, set up their sovereign wealth fund which has benefited Norway ever since.

1661 2018-07-16 20:29:07 We gave our maulanas and apas a small hamper each filled with sunnah things so a tiny jar of honey, black seed, olive oil, miswaak and then one thing personal for each of them
1662 2018-07-16 20:29:04 It’s not that bad . 
It’s mango cuts, mango oil and some spices ( varying from delicious to mild , to hot ( fiery in your case ) 

It goes with a whole lot more ..    
1663 2018-07-16 20:28:59 Interesting because water, and the desalination tech to extract it, may well be the "oil and gas" of the second half of the 21st century and beyond.
1664 2018-07-16 20:28:57 Friend: Why does it smell like a mechanic shop in here?

Me: It's the motor oil in my oil diffuser over there.

1668 2018-07-16 20:28:27 The good people of America and the values ​​of America will not allow anyone to be exempted from the oil embargo, this is the protection of terrorism. You're doing Obama's work and that's a shame
1669 2018-07-16 20:28:27 No one is building fusion reactors, while LFTR reactors in the process of being built around the world. Fusion is a worthwhile goal and should be researched.

1672 2018-07-16 20:28:23 @potus Publicly told Putin he is going to try and undercut Russia on gas & oil to take his business away from the EU. That would be devastating financially to Russia if USA runs his Deal with EU. But Trump is trying to befriend Putin....#BS #IStandWithTrump #MAGA
1673 2018-07-16 20:28:20 It sounds like Petrobras in Brazil. The oil industry is a nightmare everywhere.
1674 2018-07-16 20:28:19 I feel a little bad. But they were like oil and more oil. Combustible.
1675 2018-07-16 20:28:18 Data is the new oil...
1676 2018-07-16 20:28:17 Putin doesn't mind America's competition re the gas/oil/electricity to Europe- the prices will be effected...if disputed, let's go to the Stockholm Arbitration Court.
1677 2018-07-16 20:28:14 All I can say after today’s events is, “Well played, Claudia; well played. Olive oil shots all around”. #TheAmericans
1678 2018-07-16 20:28:09 Maybe Trump is saying: “Forget past and western alliance is better off tackling threats like China, Iran(??) and hardline muslim groups, energy(oil) security for west and peace in middle east by having Putin on their side”. If Putin proves too cunning, can policy not be reversed?
1679 2018-07-16 20:27:58 is there an oil spill somewhere? cause gas prices tripping.
1680 2018-07-16 20:27:57 Didn’t know Nancy Pelosi used to be a oil company CEO.

1686 2018-07-16 20:26:47 A nice tip I've picked up when cooking anything with oil: if you need to drain it, use a cooling rack flipped upsidedown over a layer of newspaper. There's a reason fish&chips used to be served in newspaper cones. Wicks away oil really well.
1687 2018-07-16 20:26:37 No they should stir the pot, not pour oil on the stormy waters. FFS Tom Watson said their job was to support the government, not bring it down.
1688 2018-07-16 20:26:31 Yeah Lucas Oil Stadium was around in 1980 smh
1689 2018-07-16 20:26:23 Look at actions, not words. Obama policies benefited Russia: Regulations on US oil exploration, fracking, Keystone pipeline; Decrease in military spending

1756 2018-07-16 20:19:38 Can I still do this if I based my scalp the previous night with the same oil?
1757 2018-07-16 20:19:33 Getting my oil changed at jiffy lube and my almost lawyer brain is screaming..... please don’t drive around with tail lights out if you can help it. It creates automatic probable cause for cops AND there’s almost no constitutional rights in a car.
1758 2018-07-16 20:19:03 ああオイル、どうして君はオイルなんだ…
1759 2018-07-16 20:18:57 germany is getting its oil from russia....Merkel doesn't seem to be afraid ......

'This is not your car'.
1761 2018-07-16 20:18:43 I wish someone could bath me, oil me, and put me to bed.
1762 2018-07-16 20:18:21 JUST get the oil change! Lol

My old labrador is doing really well on them and moving much better. (No THC)
1765 2018-07-16 20:18:09 This does seem like an item that would have been the natural result of the current events from season 3, where we dealt with the magic overload and priory cure/snake oil and random portals.

1772 2018-07-16 20:17:39 1.) Not sure why you felt the need to drag religion into the conversation. 

2.) Since you did, you're the one defending dirty energy like the religious zealots who seem to think God will take care of the environment.
1773 2018-07-16 20:17:36 After you nair or shave your legs and everything else Like dawggggggggggf where’s the baby oil everything so softttttt

1775 2018-07-16 20:17:16 Ii was alleged that NatOil was given the “tender”.... story was that oil transporters weren’t too happy about it....and more Siasa thing...
1776 2018-07-16 20:17:09 However, this article does explain the project was pushed back and jobs reduced or in question because of a decline in Louisiana off-shore oil activity, which was the industry that project directly serviced.

1786 2018-07-16 20:16:00 Should be set alight with oil, have his arm and legs sawn off with a rusty saw then be put through a mincer.
1787 2018-07-16 20:15:56 THIS CAR STINKS LIKE OIL. BETTER TRY TO FIX IT WITH MY FARTS AND ASS STANK. *moans involentarily*
1788 2018-07-16 20:15:47 Imagine:

After 9-11, President George W. Bush insisting on building a “relationship” with Al Qaeda, saying, “Our weak past presidents have treated Muslims very poorly!”

Or FDR, after Pearl Harbor, blaming our treaties with China & oil embargo for Imperial Japan’s aggression.
1789 2018-07-16 20:15:40 I’m gonna need all the coconut oil in the world for Hoskins in the derby and the inevitable Machado to Philly trade

1791 2018-07-16 20:15:28 It’s sooo Pittsburgh. 
1792 2018-07-16 20:15:09 I love how we attack trump for being too cozy with Putin yet it was ok for Bush to wage entire wars on innocent countries and for both parties to cozy up to pharma companies who have killed thousands of Americans and oil companies who are killing America... huh
1793 2018-07-16 20:15:07 I use coconut oil for everything !!
1794 2018-07-16 20:15:05 Why are all these construction companies going bully up? The few that survive are offshore as well cause lack of infrastructure spending. Reliable public transport would have cushioned this current petrol increase. Due to Libyan oil fields opening and Saudi producing more Oil.

1799 2018-07-16 20:14:32 The problem is not oil as oil destroyed the mainstay of every region in Nigeria too. The problem is fundamental as the average Northern youth must be allowed the freedom to make his or her own decisions rather than be conditioned to a societal norm that has failed
1800 2018-07-16 20:14:30 FAKE TRUMP - WHY IS COMRADE TRUMP SO IN LOVE WITH PUTIN?  COULD IT BE THE $500. BILLION  OIL DEAL THAT TRUMP WILL GET A BIG KICKBACK OF $60 BILLION. ?????   CORRUPTION
1801 2018-07-16 20:14:27 Literally burnt my hand in oil today 
1802 2018-07-16 20:14:19 Not yet, but that's no reason to argue against the transition to a cleaner operation for the environment.
1803 2018-07-16 20:14:17 Elmore Oil. Why does it make arthritis less painful?
1804 2018-07-16 20:14:15 so my cat is dumb and I'm running out of patience but what else is new.
she smells like motor oil and had a little wet spot on her head so I guess we have a whole night to try and wash it off.
I swear she's testing me every single day

Take a break from the negativity?
At the very least, unplug for a while. Don't let others define what's real.

Wel mooi hoor die twee strijd (bijna driestrijd met RB) dit seizoen !!
1810 2018-07-16 20:13:37 It's all about the money. GOP were bought by big money from oil&gas,pharmaceuticals, to the NRA. Trump and Family owes foreign banks billions and they are doing what they can to hold on to their lifestyle.  Even at the cost of Americas rights.
1811 2018-07-16 20:13:27 This is "The Lament for Icarus" by Herbert James Draper, a famous oil painting made in 1898. He posted this as satire for actual internet art thieves
1812 2018-07-16 20:13:26 Release Rudy Giuliani to say something about Mueller.

Invade a country and take oil.
1813 2018-07-16 20:13:09 #treasonsummit2018: Did you catch the brilliant idea to work with Russia to fix oil and gas prices?
1814 2018-07-16 20:13:07 I think Schumer has selective memory. Obama routinely dissed the CIA publicly!!! We have no clue what was said between these 2 behind closed doors. If Trump was playing “footsie” w/Putin... he wld nt have been upset with Merkle and her oil deal w/ Russia.
1815 2018-07-16 20:13:04 If being an adult means waiting an hour and a half for an oil change I will return my diploma and be back at valleyview first thing in the morning
1816 2018-07-16 20:13:04 UK has a great track record of doing this. 1980s squandered oil money to lay waste to the economy and increse the wealth of the rich.
1817 2018-07-16 20:12:59 That Rockefeller heir, remember when Standard Oil, ExxonMobil, made that threat against the heirs who encouraged Exxon be held accountable for environmental damage? Weird
1818 2018-07-16 20:12:57 Funny how nobody was pushed to buy Canadian when 0 was keeping our oil from market
1819 2018-07-16 20:12:48 They set up and destroyed a family who were the wealthiest in the world.  It was not about the injustice they said was happening. It was the gold and wealth from oil that motivated the fall of Gaddafi. His family still suffer.
1820 2018-07-16 20:12:45 What a demoralizing turn of events today in Helsinki. Trump and his buddy Putin looked so close they should have been holding hands. No going after proven Russia interference in our election process, no going after the annexation of Crimea, suggested Russia be an oil supplier..
1821 2018-07-16 20:12:37 If you look into that Marc Rich pardon and all the players involved(scooter Libby-Eric Holder-Comey) and who Marc Rich was really, it sure seems like everything is about oil and mineral mining...
1822 2018-07-16 20:12:29 In regard to the recent crisis in the oil crescent, @GhassanSalame told the UNSC it is imperative that issues surrounding wealth distribution, the plundering of resources, and the delivery of public services are resolved, for “the stability and unity of the country are at stake.”
1823 2018-07-16 20:12:06 @BegumNadiya Samosa Pie OMG!!!!!!!!!!!! Making Friday night for Saturday. We are huge fans of cold pressed rape seed oil, especially with Garlic. Thank you Nadiya, wonderful programme with brilliant recipes & ideas, explained with passion & fun.
1824 2018-07-16 20:12:01 Good job Theo. ALBERTA and oil helped finance Canada. Mr. Dressup is an apt description for the embarrassing drama teacher.
1825 2018-07-16 20:11:59 I just want Avery to txt me back already, she needs to get her oil changed and we need to get on top of it.

1827 2018-07-16 20:11:41 My own personal experience is a positive one. Been on the coconut based C60 oil for over 6 months & for the first time in years, pain is not the first thing I think of in the morning.
1828 2018-07-16 20:11:39 but anyways you know what else sucks? seismic surveys for looking for oil and gas reservoirs. you know. the stuff we're trying to move away.
1829 2018-07-16 20:11:32 I have one useful comparison in terms of economic shocks. 10% oil price rise hits UK by .12% according to HMSO. So oil price change 2003-8 (460%) led to around 4.5% off GDP in 5 years . Now these were tough times - but disaster! I don't think so. So my view is pretty neutral
1830 2018-07-16 20:11:24 Yes yes yes!!!!  I have a coworker who has an essential oil to cure anyone ailments. From poor eye sight, stress, colds, and a million others.  #nononono #youroilwillnothelpmysonpasshonorsalgerbra

1834 2018-07-16 20:11:12 Animal fats are quality fats. Olive oil. All your other vegetable “oils” are bad. I recommend the book “Big Fat Lies” by David Gillespie. It will change your life and Cholesterol results.
1835 2018-07-16 20:11:12 Had a grand scheme of getting to work early this morning but it was foiled by the car being out of oil. Thanks to regular trains & having oil at home I’ll now just be at work on time.

1837 2018-07-16 20:10:59 You should be able to get what you need. It’s so ridiculous that you don’t. If it ends up going poorly, perhaps look into Kratom or CBC oil. Also I know @JustWinks may have some other suggestions.

1846 2018-07-16 20:09:50 Yes lets get them back up to par without selling off oil, gas drilling mining and timbering rights to do so.
1847 2018-07-16 20:09:47 How is he Putin's puppet, when he has kept the Russian sanctions AND calling out Germany for using Russia's oil?

Btw, you mean the same agencies that overthrew other Nation's democracies?
1848 2018-07-16 20:09:29 Light oil regular vinegar
1849 2018-07-16 20:09:25 People rioted &tried to kill the nobles signing deal in cellar. For decades the union almost broke. If French armada hadn’t blown to Ireland, there wouldn’t be a union. But yes, Mr Darien is Doctor Who & knew there was oil when disguised as Thatcher. Your history’s about as daft!
1850 2018-07-16 20:09:24 The urban-like lifestyle of living in rural areas where you're car dependent will end in the not too distant future. Only farmers will be able to sustain themselves, as it was before oil reshaped our lives.
1851 2018-07-16 20:09:15 •Putin gutted Russian economy & has $$$ in his coffers.
•Putin controls Russian resources including oil, gas, trillions of carats of diamonds
•Also the weapons market & global org crime income streams 
•Putin is richest man on earth & is buying control of global order.
1852 2018-07-16 20:08:58 this is what happens when u get to greedy drilling for oil to keep your super rich pockets deep an fat
1853 2018-07-16 20:08:56 A strong reversal lower in Crude Oil on Monday's key reversal day.....testing a key weekly planetary support level at the low
1854 2018-07-16 20:08:28 The capitalists deceive us into believing that they have rights to land, oil and other concessions.
1855 2018-07-16 20:08:26 oil and gas baby. Oh, and Israel wants to be a superpower in the region...so that too.
1856 2018-07-16 20:08:25 also my dad told my granny she'd cook for me tmrw but I hate eating at her place cuz she's always yelling at me what a disgrace I am n stuff n stuffs me w loads of oil dripping food
1857 2018-07-16 20:08:24 Lol. Yeah. It's more complicated than rocket science.
1858 2018-07-16 20:08:19 Extortion of TPP countries to purchase weapons from the U.S. in exchange for Russia having control over the Middle East oil fields and cheaper coal costs.
1859 2018-07-16 20:08:11 Just a suggestion: in 2019 have maybe a special no coconut catagory.  My curls HATE coconut oil and most of the products on the list have coconut oil :(
1860 2018-07-16 20:08:06 We've gone from "slippery snake oil" treason to "brazen palpable" treason. Donald Trump just stepped up to a podium, smiled, and told the world he was a Russian asset. 
This isn't about partisanship. It's about national security.---------------------------------------------------

How is he Putin's puppet, when he has kept the Russian sanctions AND calling out Germany for using Russia's oil?
(I don't like Trump.... In fact, I despise the idiot, but curious question)
1868 2018-07-16 20:07:16 Go sell your snake oil to the Trumpers @FoxNews and right wing talk radio.
1869 2018-07-16 20:07:16 I said, buying an electric car SHIFTS where the fossil fuels that power it come from.

Just because you plug in the car, it doesn't mean they specifically ship you free-range, organic, hydropower.

1875 2018-07-16 20:06:28 Yeah, Venezuela was only sustainable as long as oil prices remained high, poor governance.
1876 2018-07-16 20:06:17 Speaking frankly here - “relief” as we want it may not exist. However, I do believe it is necessary to try other avenues for relief of pain. C60 is a carbon carrying oil which limits the damage of free radicals in the body. Additionally, it helps to lubricate joints.
1877 2018-07-16 20:06:06 For me it's spaghetti. If I don't have any sauce at home, I top it with olive oil, chopped tomatoes and Parmesan cheese. Doesn't get much lazier than that....boiling some water on a stove!
1878 2018-07-16 20:06:01 Haha thanks! I had roasted pepper and courgette, leaves, tomatoes, peach and fried halloumi in mine tonight, dressed with oil from a jar of sundried tomatoes. It was bangin'.

1885 2018-07-16 20:05:23 So you think this is all about oil interests overseas? Whodathunkit?
1886 2018-07-16 20:05:19 make sure benzoyl peroxide and tea tree oil work for you I suggest looking into cosrx first and maybe benton they have good stuff too
1887 2018-07-16 20:05:02 #Corn & Soybeans closed higher.  Wheat was lower. Livestock & Softs mixed. #Crude Oil, Metals & #Dollar Index were lower.  Dow higher today.
1888 2018-07-16 20:05:00 The theme to Steptoe and Son, because even though this is Totter's Lane and not Oil Drum Lane it is still a junk yard. If you think that is a bit of a tenuous link, oh boy, just wait till the 'Allo 'Allo spoof tomorrow! #DoctorWhoOnTwitch
1889 2018-07-16 20:04:56 I really hope the oil works for you :3 keep slaying 
1890 2018-07-16 20:04:55 Not quoting the indictment, quoting the effect.  It should send a message. Here’s one more: Trump massively increased the potential for US energy production w/pipeline approvals, removal of regulations, opening up major Alaskan oil fields for drilling. That ain’t pro Putin son.
1891 2018-07-16 20:04:51 It got wet almost immediately from the oil
1892 2018-07-16 20:04:44 How is he Putin's puppet, when he has kept the Russian sanctions AND calling out Germany for using Russia's oil?
1893 2018-07-16 20:04:39 It's like when they targeted Nutella because they claimed its oil caussed cancer... they just wanted to screw Ferrero
1894 2018-07-16 20:04:17 RT arunjaitley: India is today passing through a phase where a great opportunity awaits it. We need, for the next one decade & more, a high trajectory growth. We are faced with the global challenge of terrorism & the current economic challenges thrown up by rising crude oil …
1895 2018-07-16 20:04:15 Freedom and security are like water and oil. They philosophically can not occupy the same space. Freedom is the birthright of every sentient being. Security is an illusion.
1896 2018-07-16 20:03:47 My spearmint oil overtook the scent of my pine tree oil. And I only put 3 drops.
1897 2018-07-16 20:03:44 flat oil now. for real this time. will calculate tomorrow how much i made/lost on the move from 67 to 74 and back down.
1898 2018-07-16 20:03:38 No we don’t.. trump laid out his grand plan for Putin. Sanctions.. oil sanctions and played the Hilary card but he forgot to mention the RNC servers hacked
1899 2018-07-16 20:03:35 Have you ever had chili oil? A spoon full will certainly wake you up...! Or knock you down.
1900 2018-07-16 20:03:26 If they want land why did they give back to Egypt all that land which has oil in it I do believe after was it the 7 day war
1901 2018-07-16 20:03:16 I love the fact that, I no longer have to pay for oil changes or tire rotations on my car... The joy 
1902 2018-07-16 20:03:11 I see more a continuum than a gap. Point is that people should have more opportunities to experience both sides. Exemple : industry could hire experts scientists on specific tasks... 'Ho wait specific tasks and science is like oil and water.' That this kind of answers I dislike.
1903 2018-07-16 20:02:55 Curious question, if Trump is a puppet, then why the sanctions and why calling out Germany on using Russia's oil?
1904 2018-07-16 20:02:49 The golden oil is the only breakthrough that exists for you. Apart from the anointing there is nothing else in heaven and earth that can break the yoke of poverty and religion.
1905 2018-07-16 20:02:42 Just spent $58 on cbd oil for my pets... Yea I'm that pet mom.
1906 2018-07-16 20:02:41 Buy Hindustan Oil Exploration Company, target Rs 150: Manas Jaiswal
1907 2018-07-16 20:02:40 One more things if your hair is dry try conditioning you hair before washing (prepoo) so your hair strands don’t dry out. you can use a cheap conditioner and any oil. I found this helps a lot on wash day.
1908 2018-07-16 20:02:34 I know me too with little handbags etc! Lol and not used tissue bags and essential oil hayfever relief. Spare boxes of tissues. Do you remember when you could leave the house just by picking up yours keys and purse!  Not that I would change it for the world
1909 2018-07-16 20:02:30 Especially if u can amalgamate, say, the well-run Western Cape with a known feeding ANC trough like the Eastern Cape. Anything to oil the gravy train.
1910 2018-07-16 20:02:21 What's hemp oil and what does it help with?
1911 2018-07-16 20:02:10 Buying oil from Russia is not conspiracy. It’s commerce.
1912 2018-07-16 20:02:03 Miracle Whip, soybean oil, high-fructose corn syrup. You get rid of good fats and replace them with sugar. Not for me.
1913 2018-07-16 20:01:56 My armchair opinion: Extreme Narcissistic Personality disorder.  Extreme Snake oil salesman.  And with very poor background in civics and world history!  Extreme embarrassment
1914 2018-07-16 20:01:54 So those wind turbines still need oil to run

1916 2018-07-16 20:01:37 A shadow darted back and forth from the fireplace to the gloomiest corner. It hissed as the man traced his symbol in oil on the wood frame. “This won’t keep you safe,” a voice rasped. A face darker than a moonless night appeared close to the doorway, eyes glowing red.

1927 2018-07-16 19:59:56 wanted to ask again. I wanna service and which engine oil did you talk about again? for the 2012 corolla
1928 2018-07-16 19:59:55 Better don’t deceive yourself....did you buy any Arab oil?! 
1929 2018-07-16 19:59:46 and what about the close to 100 gallons of oil each one contains for cooling
1930 2018-07-16 19:59:44 That will takes years. Meanwhile, permanent damage has been done to NATO & EU. Short to mid term concern of Putin is oil prices. Russia is teetering on economic collapse. If Trump starts lifting sanctions=game over
1931 2018-07-16 19:59:38 My ex may have been a piece of shit but I got so spoiled to having my car ALWAYS seen about oil changed, new battery, tires, washed 24/7, spark plugs, all that and then some. Best believe next man I date won't be no pretty boy #GetYaHandsDirtyBoy
1932 2018-07-16 19:59:31 Boil some hot oil and throw it on hes face .... then give him a makeup tutorial with all the tools in the kitchen or hes car 
1933 2018-07-16 19:59:27 Skin: lotion.
Me: tanning oil.
Internal organs: water.
Me: tanning oil.

Me: tanning :) oil :)
1934 2018-07-16 19:59:19 Y’all put coconut oil on your face!? 
1935 2018-07-16 19:59:10 Está bancando un 4 abajo del OIL y un 0, 40 de devaluta del Real super bien. No va a llegar a neutra pero muy buena performance
1936 2018-07-16 19:59:05 It is a fact but doesn’t mean what you imply. The world trades with their neighbors. We get oil from the Middle East- where the 911 terrorists came from. It doesn’t mean they own us.
1937 2018-07-16 19:59:02 Getting an oil change and these kids are running me low!!  They need to hurry with my car man 
1938 2018-07-16 19:58:58 Protesting Oil by driving there. Lmao.
1939 2018-07-16 19:58:54 I agree w you but unfortunately the govt created an anti oil climate which drives companies away.
1940 2018-07-16 19:58:46 I've never used avacado oil, what does that help with?
1941 2018-07-16 19:58:35 Went to get my oil changed today, the men working there thought I was stupid and tried telling me that my tires that have less than 10,000 miles on them were completely bald and showing chords. All four of them have more than 50% of the tread left, I hate people
1942 2018-07-16 19:58:17 If you can find peppermint essential oil take a few drops on a finger and rub it on your temples and forehead. That provides me some relief more so than almost anything else I’ve tried
1943 2018-07-16 19:58:13 @aaronflint a bit off base on who really benefits from XL Pipeline  — CANADA  to tune of $30 billion per year  US oil will suffer as their crude pushes out US crude  high wage jobs will suffer  again  who is to bailout US oil? #mtpol #jobs
1944 2018-07-16 19:58:08 Aloe vera gel works wonders for aftercare :) and if you use oil whilst you shave, it should help a tonne!
1945 2018-07-16 19:58:00 My favorite weather is when my coconut oil is pure liquid
1946 2018-07-16 19:57:54 Oil refinery on fire in Sharon Hill is on fire. Never seen smoke so thick before. A dozen police and fire service trying to contain the fire.
1947 2018-07-16 19:57:53 Yes I’m fine my car just ran it’s self out of oil and not the engine is messed up
1948 2018-07-16 19:57:52 There is a touch of snake oil salesman about him.

1951 2018-07-16 19:57:21 Ok- our GDP is 20 trillion dollar, Russian 1-1/2 trillion!!?? We’ve told countries NOT TO BUY OIL FROM Iran, now their  getting it from Russia Then soybeans, - China has decreased purchases here & Russia is now selling theirs make America great again? #treasonsummit2018 !!!!
1952 2018-07-16 19:57:19 Really? What would make you think that? The weird apocalyptic pronouncements or creepily dousing himself in oil?
1953 2018-07-16 19:57:18 It’s soaked in baby oil now stop talking belt
1954 2018-07-16 19:57:18 i cannot discourage use of cbd oil enough. thc is a far better anxiolytic in my opinion. save your money and use the herb as christ intended
1955 2018-07-16 19:57:11 Listen to @FoxSports1350AM today at 3pm for the @Inland_Sports Show, where oil and water meet up, as @lindskogmike and @ad_chapman will be in studio talking Quakes and rioting with @SportswithPep and @GeoffreyGorham.
1956 2018-07-16 19:57:02 Government minister accepts first amendments. House erupts in chaos @bbclaurak Amber Rudd furious 
1957 2018-07-16 19:56:52 Minor movements only in the fx, bond and equity markets: US equities and the US dollar are slightly lower, while US bond yields are higher following solid retail sales data. Oil fell 4% on Saudi Arabian supply.

1960 2018-07-16 19:56:19 They do seem to have a tradition of churning them out ... 'Man of the people ' 'ordinary bloke you meet down the pub' AKA snake oil salesman
1961 2018-07-16 19:56:18 And you just have to buckle up and pray the child leaves u on his own, coz if you try to send him away or even clean his hands. The parents will feel offended! Rubbish . Now my clothes is all oil , and I have to smile as if I’m enjoying the child’s company.
1962 2018-07-16 19:56:18 I find it’s like cooking bacon... you waeven cheese is good. Getting the depth right is key. 
I let the oil run off like bacon. Idk. It works.
1963 2018-07-16 19:56:14 I don’t get some parents ,how will u leave ur child to be misbehaving as if you can’t see . Your child will finish eating puffpuff, and u don’t have the sense to clean the oil off the childs hands ,and u will allow the child to go around be smearing it off on strangers clothes !
1964 2018-07-16 19:56:10 Ogx, Pantene, argan oil, avacado oil
1965 2018-07-16 19:56:08 Midnight Oil - Beds are Burning
1966 2018-07-16 19:56:07 I just had someone tell me that someone they knew had given coconut oil to a parent which reversed dementia. However, I haven't researched it myself. #alzchat
1967 2018-07-16 19:56:05 don't blame turkey - ask yourself WHO was final user of that oil and who payed for cheep oil from ISIS.. is easy to blame middle man, while whole EU want cheep fuel.. there you go.
1968 2018-07-16 19:56:03 @MonroMB hey how bout I check ur oil. Goodnuff fer a poke! Bot scum.
1969 2018-07-16 19:55:55 This is a run on sentence. 

Run along. 

On the original idea, this world be expecting police officers to purchase their own gun & ammo, firefighter to pay for the oil changes on the fire truck etc.
1970 2018-07-16 19:55:54 When I was pregnant I used a oil blend to help with my stretch marks & I personally think it worked really well! I still have them, but they’re not as bad as they could have been! :)
1971 2018-07-16 19:55:48 I noticed and the fake Russian reporter asking about the Germans being owned by Putin due to oil! Trump stood there and blathered on some lame lie.
1972 2018-07-16 19:55:41 Germany started WWI and WWII..
They still owe 303 BILLION dollars to Greece from the war....along with other countries...
What did Germany depend on us for? Defend them when they screw up? 
They buy their gas and oil from RUSSIA. 
Gezzz..wake up!
1973 2018-07-16 19:55:35 The Camry will likely be replaced in top spot by the Mode 3 July onward. You fail to understand every Model 3 is a lost sale to every other manufacturer, every $ in revenue is a lose to the competition. Every mile driven is a lose to dealership service bays and Oil revenue.
1974 2018-07-16 19:55:19 There were a few comments that said what I thought SO this is all about divvying up land for the Oil and Gas industry ...Trump and Putin Luv Fest
1975 2018-07-16 19:55:16 turn the peanut butter jar upside down while storing to keep the oil from collecting at the top of the jar.
1976 2018-07-16 19:55:13 @Davecbb, it is evident that la Patrouille de France got in a fresh supply of blue oil for the WC2018 fly past. Bravo...allies les bleus..vice la France
1977 2018-07-16 19:55:12 He did ? How what has he done for Russia. What r u talking about. Pretty sure he’s trying to get germany to stop buying oil for Russia. That can’t be good for Russia
1978 2018-07-16 19:55:11 @Mark_Sisson Hey Mark, just bought your Keto reset book. Haven’t had a chance to get into it yet. I’m sure you make a recommendation in there somewhere,  but what brand MCT oil would you recommend for someone just starting out on a Keto lifestyle?
1979 2018-07-16 19:55:11 Does your tweets represent the average CPC supporter? I think other Canadians (Liberals, NDP, Greens, Bloc, independents), have better values than the average CPC supporter. We're ready for a fight. Racism, arms industry, oil corporations, Israel will not dictate who we are.
1980 2018-07-16 19:55:10 Coming to the blog this week! But its about 4-5 tbsp soy sauce, 2 tbsp honey, garlic clove, fresh ginger (thumb size), 1 tbsp sesame oil, 1/2 tsp mild chili powder! First time trying it but that's roughly right! :)
1981 2018-07-16 19:55:04 ไม่เคยไปไหนละยุ่งยากขนาดนี้เลอ
1982 2018-07-16 19:55:02 @msnbc_breaking Just like tRump used Trumpsters & all of us to pay his bankruptcy through the federal reserve.  Now he wants America to pay off his debt to Russia for his bailouts by Oligarch & Russian gangsters. Oil & soybeans are now making money for Russia's GDP & not ours.
1983 2018-07-16 19:55:02 ...am doin a fancy oil paint fanart of an anime because I'm apparently a teenager again xD
1984 2018-07-16 19:54:55 Had a drink on the weekend with a staunch @realDonaldTrump supporter in the oil industry. Continues to support POTUS because there are more jobs in Texas now. Worried about the finds of the investigation, because he knows it will not be good. However money comes first  #MAGA
1985 2018-07-16 19:54:42 You'll smell motorcycle oil and hear soft strains of Buddy Holly music. As you walk home you'll spot graffiti on the walls like, "Fear is the dark room where the devil develops his negatives."
1986 2018-07-16 19:54:40 is CBD oil halal?
1987 2018-07-16 19:54:39 @SRuhle It’s not about America First, as you know, it’s trump first. Follow the money. Obama’s sanctions blocked Putin’s Exxon multimillion dollars oil deal, trump has investments in Russia, so he needs Putin, he needs sanctions lifted, he needs the money.
1988 2018-07-16 19:54:35 @JuanManSantos " We are leaving a stronger economy" 

We sorted to handle the oil prices, we fought against inflation, we downsized the Colombian spread, we had invested in infrastructure, we have increased the 4g connection all over the country.
1989 2018-07-16 19:54:34 Cashew nuts contain oil in the shell that is very irritating to the skin
1990 2018-07-16 19:54:22 I won't believe a second of this Machado stuff til he's standing in the Phils dugout with cheese whiz all over his red pinstripes asking why there's coconut oil everywhere.
1991 2018-07-16 19:54:08 My last car we took it to mechanic. Guy looked it over said excellent. Bring for oil change at 3000 miles. New mechanic didn't know what he was doing. I had to sell it. 2 engines and over 8000 dinars later it needs to be shot.
1992 2018-07-16 19:54:06 Weigh out five grams of olive oil and set timer for 3 minutes.
1993 2018-07-16 19:54:05 My manager just tried to convince me that deep fried food isnt bad for you that when you use a deep fryer it doesnt soak the oil into the food like people think & the only time its bad for you is when the fryer drops below a certain temp & thats when the food gets greasy
1994 2018-07-16 19:54:01 And is currently unleashing American energy by revving up our gas and oil supply that hurts Russian interests and secures ours. Trump is many things. A blundering idiot and big baby, but if any other President was doing this we would be calling them hawkish.

1996 2018-07-16 19:53:56 the oil change dude at this Jiffy Lube just asked me if i’m “into adventure.” like an irl dating profile or some shit. wtf am i supposed to do with that. how do i go on.
1997 2018-07-16 19:53:51 Trust is the oil of the future #LeadersHour
1998 2018-07-16 19:53:43 @msnbc Russia is important because of proximity. Trump has survived with mob money and Russian oligarch money. He is familiar with RU tentacles. Putin is a logical step.  A percentage in GAZPROM is no small thing. @GOP @FBI  RU reach in oil is troubling, and strategic.

*says pilgrim again*
2002 2018-07-16 19:53:30 No I don't think 9/11 was an inside job but neither do I think Iraq had anything to do with it . Greed for their oil was behind the Gulf War 2. Also what has that to do with Trump selling out your country to Russia?
2003 2018-07-16 19:53:18 I fear you are right.
So long England.  You can always come and visit us in an Independent Scotland.  But you'll have to do without our oil, energy, water, whisky, brainpower, and harbours for your nuclear weapons.
2004 2018-07-16 19:53:14 Pastor Mark, what is your opinion on CBD oil for anxiety? Should I use that or just smoke a bowl?
2005 2018-07-16 19:53:08 @VelshiRuhle 
How obtuse do you have to be.
Its all about the oil, and trump getting his finder's fee from putin
2006 2018-07-16 19:53:07 Got an oil change at jiffy lube then headed to Pittsburgh. Got half way and heard a loud noise coming from underneath my car. Apparently my skid plate is almost off and now I’m at a repair shop in the middle of Cumberland MD. Jiffy lube ducking sucks
2007 2018-07-16 19:52:53 But you are ok with oil produced and transported from countries with terrible human rights track records and no regard for the environment?
2008 2018-07-16 19:52:52 Jojoba and almond oil are my favorite oils for body n hair 
2009 2018-07-16 19:52:36 so...no shower and hawke uses oil as always, tacking on
2010 2018-07-16 19:52:36 A machine that “fries” food. No oil used.
2011 2018-07-16 19:52:24 Olive oil you cook with!

2014 2018-07-16 19:52:04 We don’t even need Russia as a trading partner.  They are #30 as a trading partner behind Chili.  The sell oil and soy beans and has a similar GDPvas New York just how are they an important trying partner?  Maybe it’s the money you get from them.
2015 2018-07-16 19:52:02 My downstairs neighbours put some weirdass scented oil wicking stick shit on the shelf in the hall where the post goes and I was like. Thanks but no?
2016 2018-07-16 19:51:58 There were NO weapons of mass destruction. Illegal war for oil.
2017 2018-07-16 19:51:58 Another reason I must keep pushing that Agriculture  Clean drinkable water are the control for the future. They always were but we destroyed farming by privatization & corporate buyouts plus we kept destroying farm lands for concrete.If we have the food, it is better than oil.

They seem to get by everywhere else and be valuable contributors paying massive amounts of taxes while not taking any handouts or being on welfare. That's what dems tell us.

2037 2018-07-16 19:49:57 Rand is the common one... If the crude oil goes up, one needs to strengthen the rand and find proper relations and get treaties with right countries
2038 2018-07-16 19:49:50 Because they don't have oil obviously
2039 2018-07-16 19:49:47 Today you still have a shocking number of people who simultaneously believe the incompatible ideas of us coming to a end times scenario both due to peak oil and AGW caused by using oil.
A rational person would simply see that these ideas cancel out.

2053 2018-07-16 19:48:37 But, seriously, Ann, have you given any thought to my proposal that you pied piper the cult to Russia?  You will all be so much happier there. Almost no brown people. Anti-Muslim codified. Anti-gay statutes. Lots of oil to dig out of the ground. Not much in the way of democracy.
2054 2018-07-16 19:48:31 ...increasing United States military spending and auditing the Pentagon, kicking out Russian diplomats, closing three diplomatic compounds, building up nuclear deterrence to counter Russian and Chinese, and revving up our gas and oil supply that hurts Russian interests..

2062 2018-07-16 19:48:11 I do wonder, are our energy exports covered under NAFTA? If the barking yam tears up NAFTA, since we are such foes (he's filed a WTO complaint against us for retaliatory tariffs) then we could impose export tariffs on oil, gas and hydro, for shits and giggles.
2063 2018-07-16 19:48:10 just swallow a spoonful of oil and sugar it'll be literally the same thing
2064 2018-07-16 19:48:02 Most of the people who work for BNSF describe their employment as a dead end job.  The U. S. needs to gradually leverage BNSF out of business.  All that BNSF brings to any community is noise, pollution, foul air from coal and oil, and poisonous, cancerous, toxic environment.

2082 2018-07-16 19:46:05 Switch canola oil out for olive oil, it contains more nutrients and helps prevent arthritis and osteoporosis.
2083 2018-07-16 19:45:57 Hahaha y'all home cook sells soap out a studio cooks food next to his bed and bathroom plus he broke so I know he don't switch his oil lmao and his safe serve expired
2084 2018-07-16 19:45:47 Artificially low thanks to Trump's downwards pressure w/ talks of SPR releases?  And I just read that oil demand in China was up 6.6% in June, so what slowdown?  India is also up.  Pipelines are maxed.  Disruptions all over.  Reality will kick in soon.
2085 2018-07-16 19:45:47 I am teaching myself how to cook the dishes of my childhood using YouTube. It has videos made by Bangladeshis and I know they’re authentic from the sheer amount of oil and chilli they use ;)
2086 2018-07-16 19:45:43 Asking Germany to buy oil from us instead of Russia and increasing defense spending. How does that strenghten Putin?
2087 2018-07-16 19:45:36 Like $19 billion in Russian oil stock? Because that fat old bastard would absolutely sell out this country for that much money.
2088 2018-07-16 19:45:35 I thought he did exactly what he should have done. He confronted Putin about the elections. Putin said it. Putin said Robert M. could come question those indicted. Trump told him we will be competing in oil. We found out Hillary took $400 mill without paying taxes. Any questions?
2089 2018-07-16 19:45:11 Okayyy I have to get my oil changed tomorrow fr before I blow my shit upppp.
2090 2018-07-16 19:45:10 My dad, a Republican diehard for 60 plus yrs ( a lobbyist for big oil for pete's sake) said the same thing about his party.   We need sane Republicans...it's good to have both parties be sane, working for the US>  thanks for showing us there are some.

2095 2018-07-16 19:44:54 #AlzChat Coconut oil is a key part of high fat/low carb diet as well as offering g other be edits but need to be aware if PLWD is apoe3,4 they will get high cholesterol while using it.
2096 2018-07-16 19:44:52 I remember when I was little it was predicted leftists were predicting we would just run out of oil in a few decades.
When that definitely turned out to be not true they came up with the more difficult to falsifiable crackpot version of that called “peak oil”
2097 2018-07-16 19:44:51 But we also had a big financial crash in 2008. Construction was badly hit. We all felt waves drop. Not just builders, and not due to Poles. But yes, the presence posted workers at that time would of course create a negative perception, e.g. Lindsey Oil /2
2098 2018-07-16 19:44:46 ゆうきゅうとりたかった
2099 2018-07-16 19:44:40 And SO easy. A bit fiddly peeling the beans, but after that just 2 cloves of garlic, drizzle of oil and 15 minutes in the oven, then toss in the spices. Yum!
2100 2018-07-16 19:44:35 Thing about an explorative oil stock is.  You can't make the argument that oil prices rising mean nothing to it but sell it off aggressively when oil prices drop.  Have to be realistic on both sides of the coin.  So I'll gladly take some overly beaten down explorative oil

2150 2018-07-16 19:38:20 Crude oil continues sliding as I anticipated.  Most production through 2018 has been hedged at recent higher prices, leaving speculators holding the bag.  It has been a great short-side opportunity and I recommended selling above $71 in COMMODITY FUTURES FORECAST  It's not over.

2153 2018-07-16 19:37:59 Israel will tighten the screws on Gaza.  Will stop oil and gas from entering and limit fishing to 3 miles off shore until Sunday.  This despite rumors that Hamas has agreed to gradually stop all incendiary kites and balloons.

STOP THE ILLEGAL SIEGE OF GAZA!!
2154 2018-07-16 19:37:56 Yeah, NADA
But
It’s all coming out even if we go down
See Mullers indictment today

2155 2018-07-16 19:37:54 I went to get my oil changed, and a $41 bill turned into a $113 bill.
2156 2018-07-16 19:37:41 
Which Madame?
I hope service is going well.
2157 2018-07-16 19:37:37 I think I read somewhere that any reduction in demand growth has the potential to kill the momentum of the oil price uptrend...

Just something that came to mind...
2158 2018-07-16 19:37:30 That's not to suggest that it cant be mitigated, but not to the extent of electric.
2159 2018-07-16 19:37:19 Too much oil extinguishes the light. — American proverb [22060]
2160 2018-07-16 19:37:15 So I could care less what my TRN or whatever the fuck you call it is... LOL I'm out here on the beach with thc oil and red wine and fine women do you think I really care about my TRN RATING???? Hahahaha bruh just stop
2161 2018-07-16 19:36:50 No, but your tweet suggests that they are less or no more efficient than fossil fuels and coal. That isn't true. All production has an impact, but electricity can be made in a clean manner like wind or hydro. Burning fuels always produces pollution directly. /1
2162 2018-07-16 19:36:44 #NadiasFamilyFavourites love the new series, the bit about olive oil /rape seed oil was interesting, been using the cold pressed British rape seed oil for a while and it’s brilliant, keep up the good work Nadia 
2163 2018-07-16 19:36:31 @aaashhhhleeey were you the one talking about tea tree oil and piercings?
2164 2018-07-16 19:36:27 My girl is so sweet to me she said “you can take my car to get your oil changed”....still an attempt
2165 2018-07-16 19:36:16 I’m just now learning about them oil pens 
2166 2018-07-16 19:36:13 Lindsay ford took 8 hours to do my oil change and plug my wheel. Never again
2167 2018-07-16 19:36:12 How get more self motivation in runing? Becouse one day I woke up full of oil(motivation) and next day my motivation is gone. I wan’t to run but and don’t know how do to this then I got zero motivation.
2168 2018-07-16 19:36:06 What protective spray or oil y’all use to straighten your hair?
2169 2018-07-16 19:36:05 No.  She’s an oil shill.  Completely against BC’s interests.
2170 2018-07-16 19:35:59 Not sure about that. It goes back to a matter of resources. The USAF and RAF were bombing oil refinaries in Ploeste for example. Seriously depleting German supplies. It would have been a tough one to call with all Hitlers efforts manpower and resources focused on the East.
2171 2018-07-16 19:35:36 @BegumNadiya loved that samosa pie will definitely have to try it. I only use Yorkshire cold pressed rapeseed oil in cooking, love the flavour!! #nadiyasfamilyfavourites
2172 2018-07-16 19:35:32 The man changing my oil and rotating my tires is fvking hot wow I’m enjoying this way too much.
2173 2018-07-16 19:35:28 It's bad when he was accusing Germany of being in Russia's pocket(pretending that was bad***)
And we've actually moved on from that
And Putin saying we can get in oil biz together and regulate the industry and its not top news.
2174 2018-07-16 19:35:18 New tires & oil change 
2175 2018-07-16 19:35:17 I personally use S-Factor shampoo and conditioner. I also have a deep conditioning product by S-Factor too as curly hair is obviously dry. I also use Moroccan Oil do give it a little moisture and flare throughout the day.
2176 2018-07-16 19:35:16 And Reid would be burning midnight oil to find a way.

2179 2018-07-16 19:34:56 Ok but like if it was oil or sewage, you wouldn’t need to get close to smell it
2180 2018-07-16 19:34:31 She looking like the Chinese packs thst come with the extra oil

2183 2018-07-16 19:34:08 On the back of oil prob
2184 2018-07-16 19:33:57 I applied tea tree oil to his ear with a qtip then poured olive oil in his ear - about a cap full- then rubbed his ear at the base until i stopped hearing a squishy sound.
2185 2018-07-16 19:33:57 Trump has sanctioned 1 Putin ally ever 2.5 days since coming into office. Including Putin’s son in law, best friend and biggest oil oligarch. Trump approved sale of arms to Ukraine. And reopened polish missle defense. None of which obama did.
2186 2018-07-16 19:33:51 Comparing to the other countries in the region East-Med. Egypt has the more capable infrastructure +LNG plants +strategic location+FDI in oil and gas are good. But it need time.
2187 2018-07-16 19:33:49 Nun uh really? 
2188 2018-07-16 19:33:47 Sounds very promising our Julesy.

2191 2018-07-16 19:33:31 shoutout to my boo man, he washes my car, changes my oil he’s so great
2192 2018-07-16 19:33:27 @Protein_Chef @MindOverMunch @minimalistbaker @nuutrii how do I make sun dried vegetables (and tomatoes!) easily and without oil? The store bought stuff is pricey! Oh answer my prayers God's of delicious food!
2193 2018-07-16 19:33:24 Cmon Tony you know it’s more then that. Putin owns him and now he’s getting Trump to drop the sanctions Obama put on him. Then they can make that YUGE oil deal with Exxon and Putin and Trump get Billions
2194 2018-07-16 19:33:24 #Graze's fries are made from fresh cut Kennebec potatoes, twice-fried Belgian-style in Non-GMO rice bran oil and seasoned with kosher salt. #Tucson
2195 2018-07-16 19:33:18 Biotech, Fintech, superconductors, and green energy are the future just like oil and pharmaceuticals used to be the future.
2196 2018-07-16 19:33:07 Yes, he has no shame. If a tape surfaced of him sacrificing virgins whilst having sex with a gerbil, he'd just say that Hillary had done worse and his moron followers would believe him. Oil money?
2197 2018-07-16 19:33:06 Lovely lady stopped us when we were stocking up on oil and sugar today and said..’aren’t you the people from Block? Thanks so much for opening here’ didn’t know what to say! Love the people on this block.

2199 2018-07-16 19:32:54 1970-1973 five national emergencies were called. 1970s had energy crisis, strikes, 3 day week, inflation, oil crisis, divisive referendum, hung parliaments, IMF bailout - that's what I call chaotic
2200 2018-07-16 19:32:52 $cei  and oil slowly coming back! Me likes :)
2201 2018-07-16 19:32:45 Then let them calculate and compare e.g. CPI and ACL for an oil, soil, and fresh plant material 
2202 2018-07-16 19:32:45 Russia and US are competitors in oil and gas exports, but there is room for cooperation in regulating the energy market, said Russian President Vladimir Putin
Will this reduce Fuel prices in India 
Only time will tell
#TrumpPutin #Helsinki @WW3Info
2203 2018-07-16 19:32:32 Here’s a few, got NATO states to pony up an additional $30+ billion, expelled 60 diplomats, sanctions, we are becoming largest oil exporter to hurt their economy, pressured Merkel on Russian energy, closed a Russian consulate, sold arms to Ukraine, Syrian attack & Iran nuke deal
2204 2018-07-16 19:32:28 I think it's fairly simple. Russia has oil. America loves oil. Trump loves money. American money loves oil. Trump is simply looking out for American business interests by playing nice with Putin, an oil guy.
2205 2018-07-16 19:32:17 @OHSMcLemore Just purchased an oil diffuser for my classroom! Thanks Prime Day!
2206 2018-07-16 19:32:17 But all fighting to bring some oils companies headquarters to the oil producing states .
2207 2018-07-16 19:32:15 Yes and that gas and oil production is going directly to Germany now, who is propping them up by billions a year.

The only way sanctions would really work is if the entire world did it.
2208 2018-07-16 19:32:14 Why is owning a car sooo expensive? Like, nobody told me how much I’d spend in gas, the cost of oil changes, getting new brakes, etc. I’d rather ride a bike at this point. 
2209 2018-07-16 19:32:12 I like making cucumber and tomato sandwiches on toast with olive oil based mayo and salt and pepper super hydrating and yummy.
2210 2018-07-16 19:32:02 Constant run of battery production to meet demand = constant pollution source

Not to mention dead batteries are a pollution source

"Burning fuels" is the largest component of domestic electricity production

Could that go up? Sure

Electric cars are not a cure all
2211 2018-07-16 19:31:56 Our banks are not supporting government efforts at promoting non oil export. Atleast from MSME angle with Mandatory 10% value of export proceeds as deposits before processing of NXP? Sir CBN should look to this.
2212 2018-07-16 19:31:45 yoy want to buy banks you have to sell oil that's not healthy for the market  SELL
2213 2018-07-16 19:31:42 The man was, is, and will always be a snake oil merchant, a chancer and a disgraceful liar. That Ofcom ruled in this way should come as no surprise to anyone who either knows or knows of Salmond and has watched him over the last 11 years.
2214 2018-07-16 19:31:33 It's ya girl, browsing through three pages of essential oil diffusers that are all 1 off before finding one pair of kids shoes only available in one size. And only in lime green. That's right, it's #PrimeDay!
2215 2018-07-16 19:31:29 Do I reallyyyyyyyy feel like going to get this oil change 
2216 2018-07-16 19:31:26 In a scenario where SPR is released, we expect energy equities to sizably outperform oil.
2217 2018-07-16 19:31:20 Apparently I have a cavity on my wisdom tooth. I don’t care much. Brushing your wisdom teeth is like changing the oil on a rental. Ain’t much of a point.
2218 2018-07-16 19:31:13 I'm getting an oil change on my car and the car next to me was getting their cabin air filter changed. Tech had to get it thru the glove box. He opened it and a very large pink dildo rolled out.
Rock on with your traffic jam stress relief methods, lady
2219 2018-07-16 19:31:08 so i was walking around walmart trying to entertain myself while i wait for my oil to get changed in my car and i catch an old guy blankly starting at my ass 
2220 2018-07-16 19:30:56 Might hit the barber shop after changing my oil
2221 2018-07-16 19:30:54 Seemed pointless having him on as the piece was about rapeseed oil not olive oil and he didn't go into any detail about the health benefits or otherwise of either oil. He just seemed to want to brag that he can afford e.v olive oil.
2222 2018-07-16 19:30:45 Thats beyond gvt control given the global price of oil and also a weak rand, unless they subsidise fuel which may be a recipe for disaster
2223 2018-07-16 19:30:39 I just put out a tall glass of motor oil and some energon chips for when Bumblebee pulls into the garage, back seat loaded with presents.

2225 2018-07-16 19:30:27 Very large for prices in the near-term, but it reeks of desperation as speculators will buy up the back end of the oil curve.
2226 2018-07-16 19:30:24 Bull shit! The U.S. was between 86% and 91% self-sufficient in 2016. In May 2011, the US became a net exporter of refined petroleum products. In 2014, the US was the world's 3rd producer of crude oil. And 2nd largest exporter of refined products.
2227 2018-07-16 19:30:22 Are the polluters the ones selling the oil or the ones buying the oil, or do they share the blame?
2228 2018-07-16 19:30:13 JAMES DO THESE OTHER COUNTRY'S YOU WANT TO BLOW TO BITS OIL?
2229 2018-07-16 19:30:11 Putin wants the sanctions lifted!  He wants to drill for oil across the entire country.  And whatever he has on little Donald, is how he’s going to get what he wants
2230 2018-07-16 19:30:05 جب اوگرا oil مہنگا کرنے کی summary بھیجتا تھا اور میاں صاحب reject کر دیتے تھے

میاں جی واپس آ جاو۔ اے ڈرامے سانوں قبول نے
ووٹ کو عزت دو
2231 2018-07-16 19:30:03 Just when I think you women have reached the epitome of disgusting you trudge on.Russia is equal to us in nuclear weapons & is the one of the largest producers of oil & gas.Trump realizes we best be friends rather than enemies or we could be in big trouble someday.
2232 2018-07-16 19:30:03 Bridgette’s in Charlotte but I still had to text her to ask where coconut oil would be in target and keep her updated on my shits so really is she that far away

2234 2018-07-16 19:30:00 As a child I prayed for an oil billionaire to take over city. As an adult I prayed for the end of the Conservative party. You're welcome
2235 2018-07-16 19:29:56 "Wind, golf tourism, oil ship to ship transfer, salmon farm etc". Wow that's quite collection right there.
2236 2018-07-16 19:29:54 I have a toddler so in the diaper bag is a pack of Seedlings Wipes, Ningxia Red Packet, MightyPro packet, Owie Oil, TummyGize Oil, Peace & Calming Oil, Thieves Hand Purifier, a roller with YL Insect Repellant, and a tube of YL Sunscreen.
2237 2018-07-16 19:29:49 My car has no oil, the headlights have been broken for 11 months, the bottom is detaching, the CD player is broken, and the AC is now malfunctioned in the dead of summer
2238 2018-07-16 19:29:40 Oil is down as Martha Stewart enters the oil business, haha.
2239 2018-07-16 19:29:39 Boii the only smoke you see is the one coming from your hood with that sludge you call oil 
2240 2018-07-16 19:29:31 Perhaps the U.K. could have been like Norway if like Norway it had used its oil money wisely to create a mahoosive sovereign wealth fund, and also instilled a strong sense of community and equality in its people. Rather missed the boat on both of those, I think.
2241 2018-07-16 19:29:29 IndyCar will have higher ratings than NASCAR by 2040.And if I am wrong, I will move back the timeline
2242 2018-07-16 19:29:20 Helping Trump at the Behest Of Israel & getting paid handsomely.  He was a Snake Oil Salesman with a Hidden Agenda to help turnout vote for Trump & turn Dems TO Trump.
2243 2018-07-16 19:29:18 But a positive for oil longer term.
2244 2018-07-16 19:29:04 Today 2 protests in Baghdad 2 in Basra including new one at Siba gas field IED blew up an electricity tower to West Qurna oil field 3 protests in Dhi Qar 1 in Muthanna 1 in Najaf against Badr office ISF carrying out mass arrests of protesters in Maysan & Muthanna
2245 2018-07-16 19:28:54 I’ve been saying it for months. The Republicans would be far happier if they all emigrated to Russia, which will welcome their white nationalism, their bigotry, their racism, their love of assault rifles and their love of digging oil out of the ground.
2246 2018-07-16 19:28:46 A lot of people say baby oil???
2247 2018-07-16 19:28:27 $cei  IF oil keeps inching its way up   SOME ONE is going to scramble to get COUGHT UP  HEEEE HEEEE  LMAO
2248 2018-07-16 19:28:22 needs an olive oil parmesean OR a tasty pesto
2249 2018-07-16 19:28:16 Yeah for sure do you know anyone Tired of Being Sick & Tired I was until trying Full Spectrum CBD Hemp Oil
2250 2018-07-16 19:28:08 Good. I remember when Obama was going to impose penalties on oil companies for price gouging... prices dropped! @realDonaldTrump
2251 2018-07-16 19:28:07 Oil, cannabis , lithium - take your pick 
2252 2018-07-16 19:28:02 I don’t care what y’all say...my natural hair is N O T cute. Been a use coconut and castor oil from unno mother dem a use dax and blue magic inna fi unno. Wasn’t allowed to wear puffs or buns until i was 13. I just have healthy bad looking natural hair.
2253 2018-07-16 19:28:01 Meanwhile Oil -3.5% and not one Martha Stewart tweet. Sad
2254 2018-07-16 19:28:01 Bruh I HATE talkin to my parents bout tryna get a new car man cuz everytime I tell them I found a BMW or Benz I’m lookin at they be like.. “Bri you wanna pay that maintenance? $150 oil change blah blah blah NIGGA YES I DO” 
2255 2018-07-16 19:27:55 Clearly, a moronic tweet by Walsh, just days before Pres Trump urged Germany to get out of an Oil & Gas deal which is perilous. (hurts Russia) There also are current sanctions on Russia. Don't listen to this dope
2256 2018-07-16 19:27:48 No, peel and oil should be fine.  They need slightly less time to bake than spuds of the same size.
2257 2018-07-16 19:27:45 i took a decent amount of hemp oil to deal with a lil anxiety over work now. and it chilled me out. so much so that i completely forgot i was chatting to people, for like a hour. Operation Continue As if That Time Didnt Just Pass, in full affect
2258 2018-07-16 19:27:42 That is a lie & you know it. Democrats-Pelosi-DNC love socialism not @realDonaldTrump who loves the USA & US Constitution. Trump warned May-Merkel about buying oil from  Russia & becoming independent also warned them about depending on the very dangerous EU. Trump is a HERO!
2259 2018-07-16 19:27:38 when an oil change turns into buying four news tires & having an alignment done. adulting sucks.
2260 2018-07-16 19:27:38 Khamenei thinks Velayati’s trip to #Moscow is major #success by striking a $50 billion oil #deal with #Russia - Iran thinks it's protecting the regime and giving #Washington #Plans a blow. Other Iranian officials say it's controversial and ambiguous since there wasn't a confirm.
2261 2018-07-16 19:27:38 I love robotic oil poffins~!
2262 2018-07-16 19:27:31 Thank you @RepHuffman for keeping up the fight to protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge! America's last untouched wilderness is no place for oil and gas drilling. #ProtectTheArctic
2263 2018-07-16 19:27:27 The Russian economy is the size of New York’s the gas and oil production is the only thing propping them up. Again though this irrelevant Trump just sided with Russia over America in front of the world dude what’s wrong with you!

2269 2018-07-16 19:26:51 What happens if Putin cuts off his gas and oil tomorrow? Will Merkel declare war on Russia? Maybe,,,,,, President Trump is smarter than Europes leaders..... even as America is capable of being energy self reliant.
2270 2018-07-16 19:26:49 Yooo, fuck the gas, fuck the oil, fuck beirut, fuck Mia Khalifa, fuck the pollution, fuck the people. No wonder the middle east is so corrupt.  #fucklebanon
2271 2018-07-16 19:26:45 So now it’s a bad thing?!? Make up your minds already. Doesn’t the oil and gas prices go hand in hand?
2272 2018-07-16 19:26:44 By the looks of her I'd say she now smells of patchouli oil and teen spirit.
2273 2018-07-16 19:26:41 Wow! Talk about snake oil salesmen.
2274 2018-07-16 19:26:34 I’m usually skeptical of home remedies, but Morgan put apple cider vinegar and coconut oil on my sunburn last night, and I swear to god it’s a miraculous healing.
2275 2018-07-16 19:26:14 Are they not worried any more about rocket stages falling on oil rigs?
Perhaps someone bored with building steam trains can build some Black Arrows to launch from the UK.
2276 2018-07-16 19:26:13 need some oil applied lol
2277 2018-07-16 19:25:58 I've been away on a tiny island in Greece for the last two weeks and have really enjoyed ignoring my emails and swimming a lot. also I have large quantities of olive oil and olive oil products in my suitcase hmu if you want some.
2278 2018-07-16 19:25:46 It’s time they youths start showing more interest in politics not just of your country, but African and international politics, we are still slaves we also have oil that Saudi Arabia has, so now what is our stake in world politics, if Nigeria is to be destroyed how do we defend
2279 2018-07-16 19:25:46 What third world country still cares about oil and gas?
Someone is living in the past for sure...
2280 2018-07-16 19:25:45 We’re the eggs at room temperature? If not, try that. Also, a mix of vegetable and olive oil. If neither works, the obvious problem is what @JoanneKenen cited. In that case, consider cooking in Canada.
2281 2018-07-16 19:25:44 I watched a documentary on tribes in the amazon and oil companies are polluting their water and hurting them physically and spiritually :(
2282 2018-07-16 19:25:42 Got off work early so i can change my oil 
2283 2018-07-16 19:25:40 I don't think there's a tape or anything like that...  How about if Trump was given stock in an oil/gas company in Russia that will be worth a lot more when he's done blowing up most of the earth...
2284 2018-07-16 19:25:37 I would be really happy to buy marijuana from Amazon, so I can smoke a blunt! I want the real THC, not this  oil shit which don't work. Prime Marijuana #PrimeDay
2285 2018-07-16 19:25:37 my parents took my car to get an oil change and apparently the brakes in my back wheels are almost completely gone oops
2286 2018-07-16 19:25:31 I know what ya mean, but we have a Nissan Leaf. No gas, no transmission, no oil changes, no mechanics. Plug it in like a screw driver overnight and drive all day. 

My other car is a retired undercover State Trooper Crown Vic, which I LOVE. 

Sooo...
2287 2018-07-16 19:25:25 The U.S. spends over 1 billion per year importing oil from Russia.

2289 2018-07-16 19:25:20 The house-made dressings, Pesto Vinaigrette, and Chipotle Ranch, are made using an Olive/Canola Oil blend and should be soy free. Most stores also offer an option to do plain oil/vinegar for guests looking to keep it simple and straightforward.
2290 2018-07-16 19:25:14 The olive oil guy from Nadiya’s Family Favourites is already a legend and needs his own show. Just tasting every possible oil thrown at him (plus solving crimes on the side possibly) @BegumNadiya make this happen please!
2291 2018-07-16 19:25:11 @BegumNadiya loving the show. I ran out of sunflower oil today, used cold pressed rapeseed oil, roasties were spectacular  
2292 2018-07-16 19:25:11 Ayo I got this oil based primer in my nose and a 6 foot ladder in my Nissan I’m ready to quit
2293 2018-07-16 19:25:10 More money than sense plus extra virgin olive oil is not, as he claims, healthy when used warm/hot as it loses it's health benefits so should only be used cold.
2294 2018-07-16 19:25:08 Oil based spray if you have a protective hairstyle!
2295 2018-07-16 19:24:46 It’s like trying to do a U-turn with an oil tanker. The Captain can’t manouvre the mammoth vessel too fast or it capsizes. More time ....but the clock is ticking fast.
2296 2018-07-16 19:24:41 Hi Jill! Most of our dressings contain soybean oil but the oil is highly refined. During the refinement process, the proteins that are responsible for allergenic properties are destroyed. Therefore, people w/ soy allergies can usually safely consume soybean oil.
2297 2018-07-16 19:24:39 No, Russia isn't the boogeyman the media makes it out to be. Not when Germany gets 70% of their oil from Russia

2305 2018-07-16 19:24:15 Think of how much dirt & oil builds up on makeup brushes after each use. Wash them with a brush cleaner often.
2306 2018-07-16 19:24:04 When you have money to patronize us I'm sure the oil wouldn't be an issue cause then you will know we can discard it 
2307 2018-07-16 19:23:52 Why exactly are you employing this utterly duplicitous snake oil salesman?

2310 2018-07-16 19:23:34 I've used EV olive for decades, but have now added avocado oil, which is lovely and nutty. The pressed rapeseed oil I've cooked with has a fishy aroma when heated that I don't like. Other than that it's fine. #NadiyasFamilyFavourites

No clue in the name, then - rapeSEED oil???

2315 2018-07-16 19:22:50 It's not more about uncertainty but about lack of informed advisors. We have a lot of COAL to mitigate these hikes if we're to believe in building more Secunda's ! Yes, it's gonna take time! So what...at least we won't be enslaved by Arabian oil..!
2316 2018-07-16 19:22:46 This oil guy is a poseur! #nadiyasfamilyfavourites More Nadia please!
2317 2018-07-16 19:22:34 This action makes me more bullish oil I hope they keep it up. Brent back over $75 by the end of the week.
2318 2018-07-16 19:22:24 Yes because the UK has always acted so admirably when it comes to oil...
2319 2018-07-16 19:22:10 Imagine being that oil man though #NadiyasFamilyFavourites
2320 2018-07-16 19:22:07 @BegumNadiya Love your programme. Would buy rapeseed oil if it wasn't in clear bottles. Need to keep the light out or the oil oxidises.

2324 2018-07-16 19:21:49 There's no smoke without oil. Or something.
2325 2018-07-16 19:21:35 I vaguely remember something to the effect that the original point to oil development and pipelines was to make use of dirty oil refineries in Texas owned by KochBros?

2331 2018-07-16 19:21:06 The so called President knows exactly what he's doing. He's a criminal and a traitor. We're getting ready to lose this country because of this snake oil salesman and the Republican party. Please wake up America before it's too late.
2332 2018-07-16 19:20:40 A Zambian home is never completely out of cooking oil. There is always that little tea cup with used oil in a cupboard near the stove.
2333 2018-07-16 19:20:36 I think rather this is more problematic. P:"..we, as a major oil and gas power and the United States as a major oil and gas power as well, we can work together on regulation of international markets because neither of us is actually interested in the plummeting of the prices.."
2334 2018-07-16 19:20:33 It’s a start. Dounreay brought lots of secondary industries to the north, oil and gas did the same for the north east.
2335 2018-07-16 19:20:24 Oil.
2336 2018-07-16 19:20:24 I just did that coconut oil pulling thing for the first time in ages and my mouth feels super clean. Must remember that’s a thing.

2338 2018-07-16 19:20:07 Once red-hot, oil prices are suddenly tanking. rumors about emergency action from the McTrumpcake monkeys helped send MURICA crude plunging 5%

2343 2018-07-16 19:19:22 I’ve been saying this for a long time, Russia is a paper tiger, it has the GDP of Spain, but with three times the population, their main economic source is oil and gas, and their military is decrepit.

2353 2018-07-16 19:18:49 Naive because as we need wood hence forresting, we also need gas and oil, hence fracking. Neither is against the environment, unless you say us existing is. Also naive.

Don't deceive yourself. You do not have an inquiring mind. Mocking God is also unbecoming.
2354 2018-07-16 19:18:37 @Chris Wallace who do you think helped Russia the wall went down? It was the USA and who built his oil infrastructure its was USA. Get off your high horse and diminishing our President!!!

2356 2018-07-16 19:18:18 The sanctions Obama put on in 2014 for the most part named specific names. Russia's recession is due to the collapse in oil prices, which Putin built the economy around in the prior 6 years or so.

2360 2018-07-16 19:17:52 It's strange that minerals producing nations are price takers while the oil producing countries determine the oil price. Why are we not in charge of our minerals?
2361 2018-07-16 19:17:35 currently South Africa's main oil supplier is Saudi Arabia. "Nearly half (45%) comes from Saudi Arabia. A further 23% comes from Nigeria, 18% fromAngola, 4% from Ghana. Watch the Saudi Arabia percentage rise to more than 60% following this deal.
2362 2018-07-16 19:17:31 The President got it completely wrong.Oil producers dont set the price anymore.Since futures & options were introduced in mid-eighties. 
South Africa can take advantage of commodity prices through a competitive currency.He ought to know these things.Vital to SA interests.@MYANC

2364 2018-07-16 19:17:16 Google that one to make sure it’s 100% PURE. Sometimes they say it and it’s usually diluted anyway.  I had a really bad reaction to fake pure essential oil. That one might be best for a diffuser or spray bottle with lots of water for bed sheets etc..
2365 2018-07-16 19:17:08   they look tasty but da oil is too much

2396 2018-07-16 19:14:54 Today I'm reporting on  how @CalConservation aka oil/gas regulators are creating a separate enforcement arm. The idea is that those issuing permits, creating close ties to industry, should not also oversee enforcement.

Obama handed Russia his phony Red Line issue in Syria. 500K dead Syrians later. Trump killed 200 Russians.

2414 2018-07-16 19:12:41 LOL! We buy more oil than that from dictators all over the world. Heck, Russia gives more than that, as a percentage of his worth, to Trump for his golf courses, according to Jr.

2425 2018-07-16 19:12:03 "Benevolence" or thirst for oil doesn't justify destabilizing nations and arguably making them worse than they were before. And of course you can, I just haven't heard much about decrying US meddling compared to Russia though.

2428 2018-07-16 19:11:42 Maybe Predator Trump is grooming Vlad to take over for him as president. I'm sure the @GOP wouldn't have a problem with that. After all, Vlad hates gay people and loves OIL. (Just like them.) #TreasonSummit #ImpeachTrump

2430 2018-07-16 19:11:33 Why are they still there after their WMD debacle.  Oh & what leader wouldn’t look forward to his allies bombed, his soldiers killed, strict economic sanctions and the production of U S oil and gas not seen in recent history. Oh yeah, that’s what he wanted. Play that fiddle Putin.

2444 2018-07-16 19:10:04 Oil down sharply

Aft Trump asks his new partners Saudi to raise output so oil prices fall just as Trump is meeting w a gas station masquerading as a country which definitely needs oil revenue

Body language tells story Putin may b Alpha in Moscow, he is NOT the Alpha in Helsinki
2445 2018-07-16 19:09:56 That's a good idea! Maybe coconut oil or something. He's just got very dense hair, so he's kind of a mess lol

2454 2018-07-16 19:09:03 Eating whole foods, using less oil/butter & even cheese (high calories), obv substituting sugary drinks with water, lemon water, etc., & cutting out processed/fried foods. Green tea also does help by burning an extra 100 calories a day, && ofc just being more active.
2455 2018-07-16 19:08:58 True--but sometimes people really are virtue signaling, and really are hoodwinked (i.e. doesn't matter if they *think* the snake oil works...it's still snake oil).
2456 2018-07-16 19:08:53 Recently got the second service done. Tyre pressure is 32 nitrogen all 4 wheels. Still giving the same.. this week will visit service centre and tell them to add synthetic oil too

2459 2018-07-16 19:08:26 Yes, I believe one of their owners was travelling in the middle east, sourcing shells, and wondered if oil might be a profitable sideline...
2460 2018-07-16 19:08:24 we supply YOU with 44% of your oil.
that HALF!!
2461 2018-07-16 19:07:51 If HRC had been elected we would've been at war with Russia. (probably to get the oil)Russia is a small time thug in comparison to China which uses cyber against the U.S everyday in a much larger capacity than Russia and all the other countries combined.
2462 2018-07-16 19:07:43 Oil and gas oligarchs like them will do extremely well,instead of driven to extinction like THEY should be,humanity will be driven to extinction.
2463 2018-07-16 19:07:41 Agree! Problem with a ban is that the US tries to impose a ban on the principle of freedom of navigation and thus undermine their own arguments in the South China Sea. Unfortunately the buyer of Iranian oil is China, and they will not yield. The US loss of face will be total.

2486 2018-07-16 19:05:43 Wasn't Trump going to pull out of the WTO the other day? I'm a Canuck and I'm going to Tweet the PM and recommend an export tariff on oil, since we supply 44% of the US oil supply, that would sting.

2515 2018-07-16 19:03:18 I think Trump is in a great position to bring Putin down. If he can get Germany to dump the Russian pipeline deal and get their oil and gas from the US, the rest of Europe will have to follow. That takes away Putin’s money, and influence over Europe. He’s done. Let it play out.
2516 2018-07-16 19:03:14 And a oil change
2517 2018-07-16 19:03:06 Sanctions lifted so an oil pipeline can move forward! That’s what’s next!

2525 2018-07-16 19:01:44 This was also under a *Republican* president w/deep ties to the oil industry & the industrial military complex. The 2008 financial meltdown & subsequent $$ heist were also under the same *Republican* president. The SNL theft/crisis, 1st Iraq war, were under his Republican father.
2526 2018-07-16 19:01:44 I like mine coated with olive oil and a little salt, then braised, or in the oven on broil until slightly browned on the edges.
2527 2018-07-16 19:01:29 That's one jouno's take. Others say little Kinder Morgan bitumen will get to China as it prefers cleaner oil from Russia & Kazakhstan & is cracking down on "teapot refiners." Already there's a new pipeline thru Myanmar delivering cleaner crude. Meanwhile Cda closes refineries.

Perfect taste/texture! Cost: $1.50 / 14oz. We'll never buy mayo again!

2534 2018-07-16 19:00:40 Depends on the car. Some cars recommend the higher octane for their engines. Most don’t any more, but a lot of higher end vehicles do. That also be collusion between the car maker and oil companies.

2548 2018-07-16 18:59:06 If we want to do this authentically. The wood, iron, hemp, and oil will have to be imported from France.

Hopefully there are living French craftsmen that retain knowledge of the ancient art of guillotine construction.
2549 2018-07-16 18:59:02 ANd BTW "that cowboy hat represents oil & gas"? Such a not only absurd comment, but so much pandering. That's shameful.
2550 2018-07-16 18:58:58 Holy cow this Trump Putin alliance is all about business and oil. He is disrespecting his country. This is treason.

2554 2018-07-16 18:58:30 5-8 mins parboil, bash 'em around a bit in the pan so their edges crumble and fluff up, put them in a preheated roasting pan with a big slug of olive/veg oil so each tater is covered, then add rosemary, garlic cloves, salt and pepper. BOOM.

2557 2018-07-16 18:58:02 Explain how Nigeria benefited from Gadaffi if not for his intention to break the north from the South. Pretend that invasion of Iraq never improved Nigerian oil sales and then deny that Hosni was a dictator and infact was sprouted by the same Americans. Ditto!
2558 2018-07-16 18:57:51 He’s a joke..he was lambasting AM last week for agreeing an oil deal with Russia and the US paying for protection against Russia via Nato..now he wants to get into to bed with them..Not that he’s choosy but seriously Jamesob..where have the ‘real’ journalists gone? You the 1
2559 2018-07-16 18:57:46 The US simply wants to sell gas to Germany. As simple as that. Last year the US bought oil from Russia for billions of dollars. Somehow supporting the enemy, ah... no, that are the europeans.

2573 2018-07-16 18:56:57 So let's take away the corporate tax loopholes from oil/gas and frankly all industry. Please don't pretend we have not been subsidizing businesses and initiatives since we created governments...it's part of what they do and what help drives society in directions we want

2577 2018-07-16 18:56:16 Easy on gas pedal
Do your oil change regularly
Slow down
Make your tires are properly inflated 
If possible, get new tires. 

Those are keys.
2578 2018-07-16 18:56:13 Most people need to eat less.  As soon as something is tooted as healthy, the #excessiveness starts.  Whether its fish oil, chicken, fish, almonds or wine, we need to focus on moderation.  #DontCageOurOceans #StopTheGluttony
2579 2018-07-16 18:55:52 Trump/Putin worked on Crimea, oil, trade, Syria, etc and what is the press going on about? "OMG! Trump didn't defend the people who spied on him and tried to destroy him, his family and his administration!" yeah.. whatever, #FakeNews
2580 2018-07-16 18:55:51 Seeing right wingers care to pretend about Mislim lives is perplexing given they support banning them but that's beside the point. Should US get involved in every civil war? If we turned our backs on Apartheid murders, we can stay out of Syria. US will get involved over oil

Probably bought bare palm oil and kola nut and left it by her window overnight., 
2582 2018-07-16 18:55:36 i use ORS Fertilizing Temple Balm on my edges and nape because i experience a lot of breakage there during winter. i use coconut oil the almost everyday and i shampoo only when absolutely necessary. i cleanse with conditioner.

2585 2018-07-16 18:55:16 Hey Kyle, no unflavored versions yet. We DO however have a coconut flavor, and since it's already coconut Oil, that'd be the closest thing to "unflavored" that we'll get for now 
2586 2018-07-16 18:55:10 I got lotion and coconut oil what you need?
2587 2018-07-16 18:55:03 For our Rehearsal Dinner I think my dad and I got like 15 Tri-Tips for like 30 people and people thought we were going way overboard. He used to cook a ton for Oil Field BBQs and we always just made huge amounts of food. When I'm just having like 5 people over I make way too much
2588 2018-07-16 18:55:01 A oil change doesn’t take over 3 hours to do 
2589 2018-07-16 18:54:54 I infer that he used "regulate" in the sense of balancing the markets through control of oil output. He might have well suggested that Russia & U.S. can cooperate to adjust global oil output & thus creating conditions to influence #oilprice, one of Trump's recent preoccupations
2590 2018-07-16 18:54:53 Holy oil down Batman
2591 2018-07-16 18:54:50 That's fine. I am seriously contemplating the ayahuasca this coming February. I would have the chance in theory since I'll be in South America in the Amazon side of Bolivia. Let's see. I'll give you the play-by-play, lol.
2592 2018-07-16 18:54:47 In serious need of Coconut oil!

2593 2018-07-16 18:54:37 Speaking of oil I remember not to long ago one of our pilots had his triger finger on a oil feld used by isis for funding.And Obama gave the order to stand down fearing the impact it would have on the environment. And the media said nothing. There countrol is more like controled
2594 2018-07-16 18:54:34 For those who asked “Why didn’t #Obama do anything to stop #Putin?”  He did. He denied the #Russian’s cash from oil + natural gas sales by vigorously encouraging US oil + gas exports and flooding the global market.

2595 2018-07-16 18:54:32 Unemployment was 290k in October 1961. 550k in May 1973. The 1973 recession was largely caused by the Yom Kipper war, which caused the first Oil Shock, the collapse of the Bretton Woods agreement, and also the fall out from the Barber Boom.
2596 2018-07-16 18:54:27 Agree, rather some Eucalyptus Oil exits was something of great invention for me. Literally I asked people how can you get Oil from this tree?
2597 2018-07-16 18:54:16 The US overthrew the Democratically elected Iranian leader. Who was progressive. But, wanted ownership of their oil. Thus beginning the downfall. I’m well aware of the history. The money seized was Iran’s money, the money given to Iran was Iran’s money. They R no diff than NK.

2610 2018-07-16 18:53:01 The liar and chief calls himself a business man not in my book bc he said that he wants to compete with Russia for oil/gas distribution in Europe. But, thats unrealistic bc basic economic tells us Russia can do it cheaper vs shipping across the pond.

2615 2018-07-16 18:52:02 Those are pretty much the reasons we joined - to help our failing economy in the mid-70s; 1973 oil crisis... 1976 IMF bailout... increasing industrial strife and terrible productivity.

2657 2018-07-16 18:46:35 I seriously have to hide my honey bottles and coconut oil jars from my dog. He will literally take the containers and break them open by force to lick out all the honey & coconut. He feasts on wild salmon all day while I work my ass off. He’s spoiled.

2668 2018-07-16 18:45:43 I’ve never claimed treason. Not once. I know she lost. My point has always been that you can’t be a horrible human for 70 years, do shady stuff in the process, and automatically become a ethical man of the people. He’s a snake oil salesman. And you bought the snake oil.
2669 2018-07-16 18:45:43 Jason you have no idea typical liberal math the real reason for that was oil price dropped from 145 dollars to 35 dollars a barrel and look at the value of dollar under bush and obama it was worthless .do little research before the bs

2677 2018-07-16 18:44:55 anything that’s cooked with oil terrifies me
2678 2018-07-16 18:44:54 I expect oil cartels and high prices
2679 2018-07-16 18:44:49 I would say Dow 25k= Euphoria phase of a long Bull run,that’s running out of air to breath in.The smart money is shorting and in rotation.Maybe energy will see some upside and we’re overdue capex in the oil and gas industry,otherwise mergers awaits every sector
2680 2018-07-16 18:44:48 And shit FAWN Shamity.....Israel doesn't even have OIL!  And as far as a "moderating influence" in the Middle East, puh-leeez:  they are decimating the Palestinians.
2681 2018-07-16 18:44:47 Today classic US Treasury ESF coordinated oil fade complete with Mnuchin flip flop Iran story for cover.
2682 2018-07-16 18:44:39 Time to get off oil, and start using the energy that God is giving us with solar and wind.

2684 2018-07-16 18:44:30 Totally taking advantage of the free coffee at this car dealership while getting my oil changed. I also cleaned the sugar and coffee stains off their counters. Win win.
2685 2018-07-16 18:44:12 The only thing accomplish today was the liar and chief said that he wants to compete with Russia for oil/gas distribution in Europe. But, thats unrealistic bc basic economic tells us Russia can do it cheaper.
2686 2018-07-16 18:44:01 You're entitled to an opinion, i dont agree when you considering the last 2 presidents have took us to war over oil,  president trump has brought leaders together and talked.
2687 2018-07-16 18:43:59 Russia food exports already exceeds weapons export since last year (30 billions $ versus 18B $ for weapons and will be 50 billions $ versus 15B $ in 2023).Moreover with oil prices up,Russia will need less dollars for weapons exports for the next 5 yrs.Putin is all smiling.
2688 2018-07-16 18:43:57 Quite interesting the change in tone and language. During the campaign, AMLO called for the halt of all oil tenders. Now, he calls for greater transparency.

Interesting change.
2689 2018-07-16 18:43:54 Which essential oil keeps away people trying to sell me essential oils?
2690 2018-07-16 18:43:47 @seanhannity things Russia has: great soccer team, space technology, natural gas, frozen oil fields, tiny trade with USA and videos of Donald Trump.
2691 2018-07-16 18:43:45 Outside of WW3- @realDonaldTrump got the most allowed for Mueller under Russian Const.  But, of course he didn’t get Petersburg and Moscow to buy American oil, shame him publicly, or bring dueling pistols.  @TheFive @FoxNews @LindseyGrahamSC @PressSec @seanhannity @NancyPelosi
2692 2018-07-16 18:43:39 I didn’t know that oil paint doesn’t wash off easily and now my hands are colored bright red.. I messed up badly
2693 2018-07-16 18:43:24 The root cause of *every* geopolitical crisis we're facing now is oil and the effects of our dependence on oil. From the Syrian meltdown (drought) to the scrum for Russian oil, it's all the same cause. It didn't have to be this way, and it doesn't have to continue to be this way.
2694 2018-07-16 18:43:17 Beer that costs 40/bottle and looks like motor oil

2701 2018-07-16 18:42:37 Grapefruit juice or smelling essential oil of Grapefruit helps me in the winter...I don't love grapefruit here in North America...but when I'm somewhere that it grows and I can just eat it fresh...yum yum

2707 2018-07-16 18:42:25 MLM pushers are the snake oil salesmen of the 21st century. They deserve to be exposed for the scummy thieves they are. 
Keep it up Rachel.
2708 2018-07-16 18:42:18 Putin-Trump is just about the shelf life of petro-mob politics. It makes me laugh how the shrill voices against EU hegemony are either blind to, or acquiescent to, the wholesale ownership of the US, its military and foreign policy by the international oil and gas conglomerates.

2710 2018-07-16 18:42:02 That is true. I don't smoke cigarettes. Beer is only on occasion (and only if it TASTES good of course....no crappy beers for me). Again, I tried bud. Jimboman has the proof, lol. But it's not for me. I tried an L (what you saw Jimboman), vaped, and tried wax once.
2711 2018-07-16 18:42:02 BTW which MAGA do u want? 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s...? Did u like the lynchings or the oil crisis, housing crisis, black lung epidemic, love canal
2712 2018-07-16 18:42:02 Bill as an Alaskan I need to tell you that is not funny. I get it. But it's not funny. I read once that Putin said he didn't want Alaska back. But we have lots of oil in easy access to Russia. We have yet to hear what was agreed to in secret meeting btwn Trump and Russia...

2752 2018-07-16 18:38:38 Interesting. 2 things on that- 1) the onshore oil and gas sector have never said we should breach consumption limits set under the Climate Change Act and 2) the 2oC scenario involves 1300 bcm of imports by 2050. These will be increasingly more carbon intensive without U.K. shale.

2811 2018-07-16 18:32:24 they want his head on a spike...done with olive oil,&lettuce (iceberg)
2812 2018-07-16 18:32:14 I'd say that relates to global trade, rather than markets such as oil, metals, FX and so on.
2813 2018-07-16 18:31:58 You can set up an oil change online at Sears, that’s how I do it.
2814 2018-07-16 18:31:57 So, who calls the shots, historically, with the GOP? Who ACTUALLY owns the party? Who stands to benefit from dropping sanctions against Russia? Answer: the oil and gas industry, led by, you guessed it, the Koch brothers.
2815 2018-07-16 18:31:47 How can you get better services when Exxon Mobil and shell etc are siphoning as much oil as they can without even paying taxes to the Iraqis. It's daylight robbery in iraq
2816 2018-07-16 18:31:47 Oil Money Gang x @RickRoss x @Therealkiss x @JusticeLeague is timeless art
2817 2018-07-16 18:31:40 @realDonaldTrump says no reason.  Other than breaking up NATO, lifting sanctions, starting a trade war with EU & our other allies, helping Russia sell more oil, soybeans, etc. & that's just for starters; But sure, other than that no reason for Putin's helping hand. #TreasonSummit
2818 2018-07-16 18:31:39 I don't think we want oil going much higher or higher at all right now.
2819 2018-07-16 18:31:28 Yes, coconut oil should work just fine! :)
2820 2018-07-16 18:31:26 Well blow me down with a Chinese fan, Banks rejects opinion because they have experience of subject. It's like me rejecting Banks thoughts on how to be a popularist, alt-right snake oil salesman
2821 2018-07-16 18:31:20 Trump has been tougher on Russia than the last three presidents. Bush was out hunting and fishing with him Obama trying to reset their relationship and Trump calling out Germany for making huge oil deals with them.
2822 2018-07-16 18:31:17 But can she change the oil?
2823 2018-07-16 18:31:06 Crude Oil prints fresh session low at 67.57. #forex #CRUDEOIL

2825 2018-07-16 18:30:53 why does every 5 minute oil change find a way to make females feel uncomfortable?? I know I’m not the only one
2826 2018-07-16 18:30:47 Depend on the angle you look At it,since you weren't present,then the events that preceded it.
2827 2018-07-16 18:30:44 Plez explain how getting NATO to pay up $34B & slow gas pipeline w Russia hurt NATO. How does US under Trump #1 in Gas, Oil help Russia? Hpw does expelling 52 Rus Diplomats help Russia?

2836 2018-07-16 18:29:47 Lavender oil works and even listerine does too
2837 2018-07-16 18:29:35 What are you talking about?  Right now, some of the toughest sanctions ever are on Putin's back. His economy is seriously suffering as a result. Trump also plans to go after Russia's oil contract with Germany.
2838 2018-07-16 18:29:17 remember that one time I told you where the oil filter on your Xterra was?

You need this.
2839 2018-07-16 18:28:55 well it doesn’t feel like oil being rubbed on you that’s for sure
2840 2018-07-16 18:28:54 doesn't have. Putin will use our technology secrets against the U.S. 
Putin needs access to the U.S. more than the U.S needs to form an alliance with Russia. Russia is a large producer of oil, natural gas, and lumber. The U.S. can get these resources from other channels./4
2841 2018-07-16 18:28:52 Another great job Mr President. But hasn't NATO always been rich and corrupt? What needs to end is the richness and corruptions. NATO needs to start showing results as to their primary function as mediators.  Thus far they haven't netted a difference. Oil for food? They frauded.
2842 2018-07-16 18:28:51 Oil Change Thursday.

2846 2018-07-16 18:28:05 Do u still have some you're sharing?
2847 2018-07-16 18:28:02 The Iraq invasion led to a million+ deaths to date was for oil. Less than 5% of which is used by the army+government, 95% is consumed by American car/home owners. It's the "economic success", or if you'd prefer, rise of the middle class that creates the demand ergo the bullying.
2848 2018-07-16 18:28:01 Didn't he just buy a 4.5 BILLION dollar oil pipeline? I can think of other places such as healthcare, Indigenous affairs, education where that money could be better spent, if y'all don't want it.
2849 2018-07-16 18:27:46 sure..anyway here's something interesting..was walking down a street in Philly with my son and saw a young homeless guy panhandling...gave him a $20 bill to his suprise.. he told me  'u know I will buy weed with that;and I told him that's exactly what I gave him the money for:)
2850 2018-07-16 18:27:38 Maybe he is just trying world peace for once. Democratic’s sold uranium to russia. Truth hurts! usa has been used by our allies with trade deals. Do they care? No! Germany is in partnership with Russia for oil! Maybe if all senators would look at facts and try to solve
2851 2018-07-16 18:27:33 Keto karma is having to eat a spinach salad with no dressing because someone pitched your avocado oil dressing. This is payback for that sugary coffee this morning.

2859 2018-07-16 18:26:37 Wall Street is mostly flat as a slump in oil prices dragged energy shares lower, offsetting a jump in financial stocks after Bank of  America's strong results reinforced expectations of earnings growth for  U.S. companies

2860 2018-07-16 18:26:36 I believe in results and as president trump has kept every promise he made, the Liberals are going nuts because he's calling out nato for not paying their part he's called out Germany for paying Russia billions of dollars for oil and gas where is the  problem in that .
2861 2018-07-16 18:26:29 Where have you been, besides tweeting for the #resistance? Working WITH  POTUS all the way around might result in a better outcome instead of what's going on. You're highly critical while doing NOTHING to help. #resign

2897 2018-07-16 18:21:40 Trump wanted to be potus. Putin wants to destroy America & more. They worked together and trump is Pres. Now he can give putin what he wants: top secret info, sancs lift, access to gas and oil (for both of them to make $$$$). It’s gonna be a mess for the American people.
2898 2018-07-16 18:21:36 Over 50?
2899 2018-07-16 18:21:26 They want that fucking oil deal

2913 2018-07-16 18:19:08 Look back over the press conference. Trump's actions on the Oil/Gas issue stirred him up. Putin flinched. He knows he's not working with Obama anymore, or any special interest groups if you know what I mean.

2923 2018-07-16 18:17:55 no. 5---You are making the argument that under his tenure, Trump has lowered the price of oil? Good luck with that.
2924 2018-07-16 18:17:50 My scalp eats up oil now it’s so annoying 
2925 2018-07-16 18:17:50 So I'm sitting here getting my oil changed and a bikini competitor commercial pops up and some old guy turns to me and says "hey looks just like you"  thanks ya creep

2930 2018-07-16 18:17:20 My understanding is the guy set up business there, oil & gas I think, made millions but spoke out against Putin...ended up in jail...don't know what their tax laws are but anyone doing business in Russia should be careful, especially an American!
2931 2018-07-16 18:17:19 We've gone from "slippery snake oil" treason to "brazen palpable" treason. Donald Trump just stepped up to a podium, smiled, and told the world he was a Russian asset. 

This isn't about partisanship. It's about national security.
2932 2018-07-16 18:17:14 I swear I was in the mood to make myself something to eat until I got up to my flat and realized I didn’t have oil and now I’m like screw everything, Ain’ nobody going down 54 floors just for oil! After all people in the Middle East a dying!so I guess I’ll join the protest! 
2933 2018-07-16 18:17:12 I’m the type of girl that’ll get an oil change when I have zero oil left. Lmaooo I wish I wasn’t but coming to the shop gives me anxiety.

2936 2018-07-16 18:16:57 Luck does not come to play when it comes to spending money wisely.

At the exchange rate during GEJ's tenure, we got less Naira than we're getting from oil sales currently, yet the last FAAC meeting was deadlocked because NNPC declared reduced income.

2939 2018-07-16 18:16:50 Iran has the oil Putin and Trump want. Netanyahu would use us to damage Iran cause Israel fears Iran.  Terrorists? Trump is not worried about terrorists! He wants their oil. Russia wants their oil $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
So, you going off to WWIII to fight for a bunch of rich guys?

2942 2018-07-16 18:16:22 Did the vision of what an oil spill would do to that magical place cross your mind?
I hope so, I'd like to think someone like you would have a conscience. 
Now just imagine that spill in the Salish Sea... (dilbit sinks like a rock, BTW)

2943 2018-07-16 18:16:12 When there are no arguments. Oil and gas sales are to be or not to be Russia and Putin

2956 2018-07-16 18:14:49 Way more effective & way cheaper for Americans to close market for Russian oil & gas and sending business to Russia. But, it would take an international effort. Economic sanctions is our best option. Putin & the Russian people would absolutely hate it.

I think one of the big problem of F1 games are flags because some need to be on the game

White : Slow car ahead
Double yellow : Big danger
VSC ( FP + Q )
Blue flag ( Q ) : Let driver pass when they are on a qualify lap
Rain flag 
Yellow/red flag : debris and oil

2995 2018-07-16 18:10:48 Many corporations get huge tax incentives and subsidies, that we pay for.  The oil industry alone get's more than $4 billion a year in subsidies from our taxes.  Corporations got a huge tax break and did not pay the workers making record profits for them any higher wages.

3002 2018-07-16 18:09:45 Cheap coffee is a horrendous thing.

It generally has no bite, and almost no taste, as if the spectre of coffee rather than the thing itself had been laundered at length, before finding at last the refuge of one's cup.

Thus it insinuates itself into our comfort, like a foul oil.

3010 2018-07-16 18:08:49 Phishing is still a form of hacking, but your comparison is right. Still...they actually hacked into the DNC and RNC, alongside using Phishing techniques. Wonder which side is being blackmailed. Surely not the side crying for Mueller to wrap up the investigation.

3017 2018-07-16 18:08:20 You noticed the subsidies for solar and wind. 

Do you also notice the subsidies that gas, coal, and oil get? 
The zoning variances, the rights of way, the police protection, prosecution of whistle blowers?

My town was built for cars. Freeways get more attention than trains.

3023 2018-07-16 18:07:46 One of the most important (and underreported) ways Trump is helping Putin out is by blocking climate action and keeping the world hooked on fossil fuels — including Russian oil and gas.

3026 2018-07-16 18:07:34 So your suggestion is what? Ignore Putin and start a war? Should we rig their elections? Nothing wrong with ending the Cold War. All of the sudden lefties are for war bc they lost an election. Trump policies are not great for Russia. Trump wants to undercut their oil dominance.

I think he LOVED Obama being POTUS.

3036 2018-07-16 18:06:28 The US was corrupted looooong before Putin. Our enemies are right here in the big banks, Wall Street, big pharma, big oil, private prisons, and insurance scammers. Russian meddling is a fabrication to divert attention from our real traitors and domestic terrorists.

If the entire federal gov’t is public ally saying this is about selling oil to Asia, then this isn’t about the pipeline at all...but rather what comes next, with oil tankers, fire risk and spill unpreparedness.
3043 2018-07-16 18:05:48 The next years balanced billing cycles for heating oil. We are going to double pay it to hedge against any sticker shock for when Oil goes up.

3045 2018-07-16 18:05:20 That's why Britain loves them not the Igbos that are educated enough and challenging them intellactuallly.. what the evil British really want are the illiterates from the north that will be allowing them to take the oil without questioning them

3083 2018-07-16 18:00:59 Are you going to cough up these mysterious memes you supposed saw or not, because your droning on & on & on is a real time waster with no point. 
3084 2018-07-16 18:00:56 yea except it was made from a who-knows-good-or-bad-kind-of potatoes and fried with oil with much preservatives added along the way.
3085 2018-07-16 18:00:56 I wouldn't be able to survive the current weather of Malang without cajuput oil. Hidup minyak kayu putih (dan minyak telon)!!!
3086 2018-07-16 18:00:50 Once he returns to U.S., after he fills up Air Force One with Russian fuel oil, trump plans to name Aaron Burr to a cabinet post.

3092 2018-07-16 18:00:28 so apparently our AC is fucking broken somehow. it’s so hot that the coconut oil in the pantry was completely melted when I used it last night
3093 2018-07-16 18:00:26 News: Prime Day

Not News:

- All time low, black unemployment
- Obama actively allowed Hezbollah and Taliban to smuggle drugs into US
- US again top oil exporter
- Democrat IT aide illgally sent hacked data to Pakistan
- Medicaid and Medicare over prescribed opiods
3094 2018-07-16 18:00:23 @realDonaldTrump We stand like a mountain and will not allow any country to be exempted from the oil embargo.
3095 2018-07-16 18:00:21 Wouldn't the 3 light blue up short term mean that we will get a move up before continuing downward?
3096 2018-07-16 18:00:21 PSA...coconut butter is NOT the same as coconut oil!!!
3097 2018-07-16 18:00:15 Whoop whoop it’s been a very long summer without #indiehour
3098 2018-07-16 18:00:13 If anyone tryna let me let you pay for my oil and oil filter lemme know
I’ll even install it myself for da free 
3099 2018-07-16 18:00:10 Smidge more adulting. Werk out. Shower. Oil. Write. 

A plan
3100 2018-07-16 17:59:41 Who benifits from chaos in the oil rich middle east? Yup, RUSSIA!!Do they “meddle there”. IC want to let us know? So it could be just that.
3101 2018-07-16 17:59:39 With fuel prices headed towards R20/l I think its time we formed an intergovernmental organization of oil consumers. We should call it the Organization of Fuel Using Countries, and tell OPEC that if they keep it up they'll be hearing from OFUC. #FuelPriceHike
3102 2018-07-16 17:59:38 @realDonaldTrump You owe us more than that, Iran's oil should reach zero by November, otherwise our relations will get worse day by day, and your situation will surely be seriously damaged.
3103 2018-07-16 17:59:35 I protested because he went against just about every scientist on earth and pulled out of the Paris climate Accord just because oil and gas companies paid for his election. Amongst a whole host of other things. Is that ok with you?
3104 2018-07-16 17:59:34 The poor man of Europe because we’d had a Labour gov along with trade unions that brought this country to it’s knees. FTD’s were in their infancy so we as didn’t get the full benefits of them. The EU did. It only allowed us to join after N.Sea oil was found & asset stripped us
3105 2018-07-16 17:59:31 Yup, No US-President has ever worked full-time for another country's interest. It makes no sense whatsoever. 

Trump lied about the oil thing too. Germany gets 9% of its gas from Russia. Instead of the 70% Trump claimed. I guess some people may claim it's because of stupidity...
3106 2018-07-16 17:59:28 u sweatin canola oil?
3107 2018-07-16 17:59:25 I gave them some fish oil treats to keep their coats silky and shiny
3108 2018-07-16 17:59:10 Boy you're all over the place here now, trying to sling some mud because you got nothing and it shows.
Too funny.
3109 2018-07-16 17:59:07 Yep couldn’t see anything entertaining just excruciatingly painful watching yesterday’s man and Tasmina ‘look at me oh wait don’t my constituents binned me’ Tasmina-Sheikh spouting nonsense and shock of shocks misleading folk. Misleading folk is the SNP M.O snake oil merchants!
3110 2018-07-16 17:59:00 The development of the Olive Tree of Israel in your heart is the continual experience of God’s favor, the golden anointing oil.
3111 2018-07-16 17:58:55 I’ve taken primrose oil, nothing. Upped my antidepressant, nothing. Hormonal birth control helps during my period, but I’m over emotional the other 3 weeks. I hope the yam and maca help you.
3112 2018-07-16 17:58:49 When you go to get your oil changed and both air filters need to be changed too anyone I want a car?
3113 2018-07-16 17:58:47 Don’t stop until 38 
3114 2018-07-16 17:58:38 -Drink a lot of water
-No fast food only veggies and fruits
-Have a consistent skincare routine
-put coconut oil on you lashes everyday to make them grow thicker, longer and faster
-Do at least a 15 minutes workout a day
-Moisturise your lips, face and body every day!
3115 2018-07-16 17:58:34 They directed them across the board. Confusion and chaos is the goal. A particular political ideology is not relevant since none but Bernie's come even close to their's
3116 2018-07-16 17:58:29 Woohoo! hump away 
3117 2018-07-16 17:57:32 @DennisPrager Mat 26:11  "For the poor you have with you always; but you do not always have Me. 
In context, a woman had just poured "expensive" perfume (oil) on his head and His disciples complained that the cost of the oil  could have been put to better use.
3118 2018-07-16 17:57:23 #NP Neil And Adam @neiladammusic - Oil Fire on @Xtreme365R
3119 2018-07-16 17:57:18 Let’s see now.  He didn’t bomb our Naval Fleet; he didn’t burn oil fields and attack Israel ; he didn’t fly any planes into buildings on US soil killing thousands of US citizens.  He hacked the DNC because Hillary & Podesta were too stupid to password protect their systems.  Duh.
3120 2018-07-16 17:57:18 This is about money. That really is all Trump cares about. It is all starting to make sense.  It is about controlling gas and oil prices.  Deregulation and grabbing public land to develop. Control the price of energy and you control everything
3121 2018-07-16 17:57:08 The Big Hump  has begun:)
3122 2018-07-16 17:56:54 Wedge 'em up and lightly coat in garlic oil and sprinkle with chilli flakes, 25 mins or so on 180 usually does the trick, flipping 'em half way through.
3123 2018-07-16 17:56:51 Hi! CC+Oil Free Matte is perfect for all skin types! IT will give you a matte finish on the skin, without drying. We do find that our IT Girls with oily and acne-prone skin prefer to use this to keep oil and shine to a minimum! We hope you try it out! XOXO
3124 2018-07-16 17:56:47 Don't worry about Mr. Grahm, David. Down here in S. Carolina; the running joke is that little Lindsay was raised by his aunties & grandma to be the best Hall monitor & Vice Principal informant that his little school has ever seen. I'm betting he's got some big oil bribes stashed.
3125 2018-07-16 17:56:44 want my attention?  boobs
want my approval?  boobs
wants me to rotate your tires, change your oil, paint your house and steam clean your floors?  boobs
3126 2018-07-16 17:56:39 Today’s lunch: shredded kale-arugula salad w/bacon, feta tossed w/Sicilian spiced olive oil & red wine vinegar, plus figs & a peach #foodie #summerfood #gardenfreshgreens
3127 2018-07-16 17:56:35 Shut the hell up,, it's as clear as the nose on your face..
I don't wonder at all, I KNOW what Trump is doing.. it's all about the money.
With Russia, he'd sell the very country he promised to protect for oil money.
We don't wonder at all.. we know!
prosecute his ass.
3128 2018-07-16 17:56:34 Lavender oil
3129 2018-07-16 17:56:33 The only real downside would be the savage sunburn from being out in the scorching desert sun covered in oil.
3130 2018-07-16 17:56:30 #brent $bno broke 72.5...down 5% now. Oil stocks holding in as no one believes it yet, but support wont last long. #oott $xle $oih
3131 2018-07-16 17:56:29 Only 1 internet unless you're into the dark web doing things you shouldn't be doing.
3132 2018-07-16 17:56:23 Pura pinche mafia en estos trabajos de las refinerias y oil field, si no conoces a alguien no entras. #latristerealidad
3133 2018-07-16 17:56:04 Silly trumpanzies. Do I have to explain everything to you?  "fracking". Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is a technique designed to recover gas and oil from rock.  Something trump is big on to help his buddies. Trump doesn’t like natural energy cause his friend won’t make $$$
3134 2018-07-16 17:55:55 They had a matte black MacBook way back when. It showed a lot of oil residue from hands
3135 2018-07-16 17:55:52 Actually Not necessarily, the thought of such will only make u think ure not ready for marriage. While its not the most important thing in marriage.
3136 2018-07-16 17:55:50 Small details will understandably get buried in the overall shock of what we saw, but... now we both have a shared interest in making sure oil prices stay high?!? WHAT?
3137 2018-07-16 17:55:43 Just found out that Culver’s has an allergen guide in a booklet that you can take with you!! Awesome for someone with a soy allergy!! More places need to do this, and stop using soybean oil!! Thanks @culvers!!
3138 2018-07-16 17:55:42 @keeleyelemis hi Keeley. Should I use bliss capsules before or after the Hero Project glow oil please? Thanks.
3139 2018-07-16 17:55:32 Well, to be fair there's also that little half trillion dollar oil deal.
3140 2018-07-16 17:55:22 Tell that to the English. CO2 has no taste whatsoever numbskull.
The discussion started about climate change and oil in windmills. Not about any product being toxic in whatever concentration. #stickingtothetopic
3141 2018-07-16 17:55:21 I've seen the memes directed at the maga crowd, you made the claim there were more that were directed at the greens & independents.
3142 2018-07-16 17:54:50 Skin colour 
3143 2018-07-16 17:54:49 Actually, I’m not a “liberal” or a “leftist,” but thanks for playing.

I’m actually a moderate Independent, who’s sick of seeing conservatives sell their party out to Nazis and snake oil salesmen.

We used to have two functioning parties, and I’d love to see that again.
3144 2018-07-16 17:54:48 Outside oil workers and civil servants,i doubt there is a concrete form of collecting/monitoring tax payments in Nigeria
3145 2018-07-16 17:54:45 Trump is Metternich of r time as he uses RUS to get his way w NK, eventually Iran
He has started the end of Palestinian problem by outflanking them w a grand bargain with Saudi & Sunnis which involves oil, arms, r help w Iran (see above) & they impose solution on Palestinians
3146 2018-07-16 17:54:38 I know I say this a lot but... lavender oil.
3147 2018-07-16 17:54:31 The pee pee scandal wouldn't even be ruinous at this point. Putin's real leverage is the brokerage fees Trump was promised on the oil company sale, various other mega deals that can pull him out of the red, & the simple fact that his ego can't handle admitting his true acts.
3148 2018-07-16 17:54:26 Then you really have no idea what your talking about?
3149 2018-07-16 17:54:11 just . dont pour water onto a hot pan again esp if it has oil on it
3150 2018-07-16 17:54:05 Gram-for-gram, oil has the same number of calories as beef fat.  One tablespoon of oil has 120 calories and 14 grams of fat. Within hours of ingesting oil—olive oil, corn oil, palm oil, etc.—arteries stiffen and their ability to dialate is impaired.
3151 2018-07-16 17:53:52 Also: that snake oil salesman really pulled one over on you
3152 2018-07-16 17:53:49 Also hearing good reports of Vit D (5000mg)and Omega 3 Fish Oil daily.
3153 2018-07-16 17:53:39 Well....it seems both counties are ALL IN on Oil.
A big reversal of the good that has been done for the last ten years.
Waht about the New Energy that will take us in to the next century.
#Trump's wannabe idiot Doug @fordnation must be shitting his pants with glee.
3154 2018-07-16 17:53:29 I'm the oil to Twitter's water today.
3155 2018-07-16 17:53:28 You made the claim, so it's your work.
BTW, which memes should I be looking for on ALL OF THE INTERNETS?
3156 2018-07-16 17:53:25 #NowPlaying Power and the Passion - Midnight Oil
3157 2018-07-16 17:53:24 Putin: "we could work together on regulation of international (oil & gas) markets, because neither of us is actually interested in the plummeting of the prices"

Holy shit. He wants to fix oil and gas prices with the U.S. Amazing. @PreetBharara @SpeakerRyan
3158 2018-07-16 17:53:04 These rats don't even know how to vandalize properly... is that clow making oil designs on the floor? Idiots!
3159 2018-07-16 17:52:49 her subtweet was so deep it struck oil
3160 2018-07-16 17:52:47 Is Putin pushing U.S. to civil war? 
Carve up the U.S.A. so he can have access to  oil , food and cheap labour? Does he want americans to kill each other so trump can invoke Marshall law? Seems to be an idea.
Today lines are drawn.
3161 2018-07-16 17:52:21 Interesting how writers today write that dark amber interior lighting into their screenplays: "shrouded in pools of shadow," "semi-darkness," "curtains block out most light," "week sunlight," "flickering candles," "oil lamps flicker," "a shaft of frail light," "failing light."
3162 2018-07-16 17:52:17 @jeremycorbyn are you and your party behind legalising cannabis/cannabis oil to eleviate the suffrering of epilepsy suffreres?
3163 2018-07-16 17:52:13 What has he given Putin?  He is trying to cut off his oil customers. He is inflicting harsher sanctions than Obama did.  He is arming the Ukraine, something Obama refused to do.
3164 2018-07-16 17:52:13 No. He wasn't important enough, just controls a massive amount of the world's oil supply.
3165 2018-07-16 17:52:09 "oil prices are down, lets start a war.."
3166 2018-07-16 17:52:09 We know from #WhoIsAmerica that u are a corporate prostitute, it's safe to say defense and oil co. have agreed that Trump has done enough damage to the reputation of the #GOP and are ready to jump ship. The question is, who is a bigger money trollop than @realDonaldTrump and you?
3167 2018-07-16 17:52:05 I sold this last year for 3+ This is a debt free co. as oil goes up solar will come back.  Right now I feel this is a $3 stock and up from there -if- Lacy takes advantage of current position which may be to sell a $5+ as he has done in the past
3168 2018-07-16 17:51:59 well we dont have any oil or gas for anyone to come and take so we are OK
3169 2018-07-16 17:51:56 It's always oil.
3170 2018-07-16 17:51:30 Hey if you have a VW and need an oil change or sumthing hit ya girl up I can give out dealz
3171 2018-07-16 17:51:23 I really don’t feel like going to get a oil change.
3172 2018-07-16 17:51:05 I got hot oil into it
3173 2018-07-16 17:51:04 Their economy is heavily dependent on oil, and really rises and falls with oil prices.

3175 2018-07-16 17:51:00 Crude oil $66.80 momentum building to the downside $USO
3176 2018-07-16 17:50:55 Hair upward in short crops, fixed in position with hair oil, which was typical portrayal of Greek athletes
3177 2018-07-16 17:50:38 The film from Bresson is Le diable probablement ('77), but it is not about the Torrey Canyon, but about the Ekofisk oil field spill of April 22, 1977 in the North Sea. This spill was about 1/3rd of the size of the Torrey Canyon spill: about 27,000 tons.
3178 2018-07-16 17:50:34 Schachter still calling for sub $60 oil. I don’t agree and will be buying energy names this week. We will see what happens. $GTE.to $ATH.to $PXT.to $CNQ.to $VET.to $YGR.to $LXE.v $TVE.to
3179 2018-07-16 17:50:19 ppl shuck off straw debate and say we need to "address corporate pollution" but what does that look like? some kind of statist approach w cap and trade legislation for plastic waste? with the EPA functioning the way it is rn?? gl w/ that...we need to execute the oil execs
3180 2018-07-16 17:50:14 Get off twitter and worry about finding some beard oil or growth supplements. Your priorities are fucked up rn.
3181 2018-07-16 17:50:11 I’m sure that’s true. The @gop has sold America to Russia, a snake oil salesman as the broker. America is gone. Liberty is gone. #TREASONOUSTRAITORS

3183 2018-07-16 17:50:06 That won’t get my car a oil change 
3184 2018-07-16 17:50:01 After Trump blasted Ger. for getting 35% of it's energy from Russia, Putin said:
"We as a major oil and gas power,and the United States as a major oil and gas power as well, can work together on international regulation of markets."Sounds like price fixing w/ Trump as his buddy
3185 2018-07-16 17:50:01 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
3186 2018-07-16 17:49:58 Their relationship started way before his fake presidency. 45* made a $1T oil deal with Putin and Tillerson in 2013. He also has steel money. Scores of "loose ends" (journalist) killed by Russians and he is letting Putin loot the Treasury  as payment.
3187 2018-07-16 17:49:33 I’ll give it a try with cloves of garlic and olive oil.
3188 2018-07-16 17:49:32 After shaving my head I've learned that there is an incredible amount of maintenance that goes into keeping that hair healthy and Tea Tree Oil is my new friend.
3189 2018-07-16 17:49:31 You've heard of the Rothschilds.. bankers they made their money off Countries... they funded Hitler... Napolean and his opposite... they profited off all wars. Iraq war wasn't about oil or WMD's.. but about control of the country..
3190 2018-07-16 17:49:21 Everything you named happened under Obama.  Trump got concessions on Syria, Golan Heights, Oil Production, Ukraine gas supply + Putin agreed to abide by prev. treaty and allow Mueller to go to Russia and interview GRU agents. + Trump was firm on Crimea.
3191 2018-07-16 17:49:20 WTI oil -$3.06 to $67.95/barrel on talks of a possible release of global crude reserves, slowdown in economic growth. The International Mone
3192 2018-07-16 17:49:19 The medical establishment is even delaying allowing severely ill children access to cannabis oil - so behind - holding back progress
3193 2018-07-16 17:49:18 Do you sell Black Seed Oil? @EarthElementsJA
3194 2018-07-16 17:49:16 What happens if you wood oil a tree?
3195 2018-07-16 17:49:08 ダイエットしていたって、時にはオイルも必要だろう?
3196 2018-07-16 17:49:07 I need an oil change :(
3197 2018-07-16 17:49:06 This proves that you are where you are only because of your father. If you think that Trump who just crucified  for relying on  oil; who single handedly secured NATO - strengthening Europe against  aggression, is throwing his country under the bus, you should retire
3198 2018-07-16 17:48:55 Oil: oil deals are concluded in USD, fluctuation of dollar will affect price and price the demand, most likely asynchronously creating instability
3199 2018-07-16 17:48:50 For a  moisturizer I just use hemp or rosehip oil.

3202 2018-07-16 17:48:21 Listen, I personally don’t agree with many of the ideas/beliefs of Islam. And perhaps religion plays a role in their current situation.

But I also think that colonization by Western powers & wealth extraction of their oil played a very important and probably larger role.
3203 2018-07-16 17:48:18 You prepare a table before me
    in the presence of my enemies;
you anoint my head with oil;
    my cup overflows..
3204 2018-07-16 17:48:14 Exactly what did Trump give Putin, some oil? More uranium? Let him invade another country without opposition? Oh, another reset button, how nice.
3205 2018-07-16 17:48:14 European is a good oil+gas market for booth with high prices

3209 2018-07-16 17:47:50 Putin doesn’t care about our “way of life”. He wants those sanctions lifted. Period. Trump has been trying to do that for Putin since he got into office. Withdrawal from the Iran agreement may have made up for it, since the price of Russian oil rose so high.
3210 2018-07-16 17:47:37 @ayeshacurry made the lemon olive oil cake it was a hit. First cake I’ve made that was moist and didn’t fall lol. Thanks for the recipe love your show on  OWN
3211 2018-07-16 17:47:34 Today, I experimented with stir fry strip beef. I made what I will loosely refer to as drunken master beef. I think I am gonna throw it in my spicy ramen to add some oomph. Oil, soy sauce, tamari sauce, oyster sauce, and drown it in vodka shortly before it is finished cooking.
3212 2018-07-16 17:47:33 Doesn't matter. The point is trump squawking about Germany getting some percentage of their energy needs from Russia at the same time as we're *significantly* increasing our oil imports from them, is hypocritical at best. Outright deceptive, in fact.
3213 2018-07-16 17:47:33 Anyone long #CL #OIL :

You have my full empathy.
3214 2018-07-16 17:47:31 You know it is Harper‘s fault that Trudeau was forced to buy that pipeline. Go back and look at the rules of FIPA. The Chinese demanded that we get AB oil to Tidewater because not to do so would injure China’s profitability & they have right to sue under FIPA.
3215 2018-07-16 17:47:13 Britain had hoped to hold tenaciously to the Biafran wealth (OIL AND GAS) which they confiscated since 1970. But Biafra is here. So Britain is doomed.
 Come quickly Oh Biafra!

3216 2018-07-16 17:47:04 WTI oil $69.38/barrel, -$1.63.
3217 2018-07-16 17:47:02 But when Europe goes behind our backs and buys oil and gas from these people, while over 3000 American companies do business in Russia, our politicians take money from lobbyist from every corner of the world,we people are left wondering who the hell does our government work for?
3218 2018-07-16 17:46:54 Colorscape is pleased to welcome oil painter Svetlana Pavlicek to West Park in September.
3219 2018-07-16 17:46:45 And so did many donors of Hillary Clinton. How much oil money did she get? Even millions from Russia! Who are you kidding with that tweet???
3220 2018-07-16 17:46:44 Don't believe me? Do your research..Stop watching Fake News! You'll find out Soo much more how corrupt The Clinton's,Obama and yes Bush...Bush was into getting Rich from Foreign oil and Entry of and Uranium! Facts are Facts.Think back what went on..while they were in Office!

3223 2018-07-16 17:46:38 The seeds have almost 600 calories for 100g, the raisins have 300 per 100g, olive oil has a whopping 884 calories per 100g...
3224 2018-07-16 17:46:30 Elected officials are grossly overpaid. @SenSanders net worth makes him close to or at the Millionare level and he has been a career politician. Sneake oil salesman.
3225 2018-07-16 17:46:29 S&amp;P futures flat after the Bank of America reported strong earnings though oil prices are lower as supply disruptions ease.
3226 2018-07-16 17:46:09 I’ve always wanted to work in the oil field LOL
3227 2018-07-16 17:46:00 @SRuhle Your explanations about OPEC+ with Russia joining OPEC & benefitting from increase in oil prices makes sense. How much do the Saudis still own of Fox News?
3228 2018-07-16 17:45:51 What will oil/gas prices do seems more important.  Considering the two largest energy producers decided to get along.
3229 2018-07-16 17:45:49 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.
3230 2018-07-16 17:45:47 The universe knows I can’t make decisions... so why the heck is this recipe telling me to choose between “vegetable oil and water” or “butter and milk”
*puts ingredients away and doesn’t bake the cake*
3231 2018-07-16 17:45:47 Combine 8 oz cake with 9 tsps jelly / jam. Adorn with  Olive Oil. Fry. Serve for brunch
3232 2018-07-16 17:45:44 So oil remains landlocked and held hostage to US buyers at a fraction of market value?  Theres always a pipeline either way you look at it.
3233 2018-07-16 17:45:41 Got an oil change change and my tires rotated and didn’t have to pay a dime 
3234 2018-07-16 17:45:41 I really need to get my oil changed but I keep putting it off because the thought of calling Goldy Auto and talking to someone makes me very anxious

3236 2018-07-16 17:45:26 Right wing twitter thinks they're owning the libs today, omg.  - to me its not just the meddling in elections, its what compromising crap does Putin have on Trump, its the 2 oligarchs linking up in pursuit of propping up oil, denying climate change, and white supremacy

3243 2018-07-16 17:44:15 Besides Trump wanting to be a dictator like Putin, big oil wants to drill in the Russian Artic.
3244 2018-07-16 17:44:10 To your tyrannical system because Brunei sugarcoats it with oil riches. Its fucking absurd how a group of Bruneians retaliated to such a petty tweet by a Malaysian, made it into a dick measuring contest when your own country is a contradiction in itself.

3256 2018-07-16 17:43:33 vicente is a corrupt hypocrite, I do not know why he cares so much what Trump says if he did more damage to the Mexicans leaving us poorer and insecure he stole the oil of Mexicans and never did anything for this country he is a piece of shit
3257 2018-07-16 17:43:32 As Germany buys billions of $$$ in oil from Russia? Yeah, ok.
3258 2018-07-16 17:43:31 Changing the oil in the @Acura was super easy Changing the oil in the @Saab is a PITA (Pain in the Ass)

3267 2018-07-16 17:42:00 Guess you missed Obama’s spying on Merkel and Merkel giving billions to Russia and depending on Russian oil to survive. Trump CUTTING OFF MONEY and telling NATO to INCREASE DEFENSE helps Putin HOW?
3268 2018-07-16 17:41:54 Why is Germany buying gas and oil from Russia? You are funding a country you feel is “Bad”.

3278 2018-07-16 17:40:20 #MedicalCannabis types of oil can help with some conditions. Must be wider availability of products that can help.
3279 2018-07-16 17:40:16 So very glad to see this.  It costs us a fortune to buy the oil and it has me off other pills which were covered.  Fingers crossed this goes through in a timely manner.

3285 2018-07-16 17:39:57 Lots of Left Wing Globalist are good middle class citizens that are borderline conservatives and don't like this label nor find the Trumps trade ideas productive.  Note real wages have decreased since Jan. 2017, although 70% Oil related, this may effect midterms like 2006 Bush.
3286 2018-07-16 17:39:49 My fave is to chop them into chunks, drizzle with olive oil and copious maple syrup, season and whack em in at 200 C for half an hour. Shake them a few times during cooking to coat them fully.

3292 2018-07-16 17:38:47 Petite remarque. On trouve souvent les langues d'oil et d'oc sont souvent regroupées comme faisant parti d'un même sous groupe. C'est faux l'occitan est inter compréhensible avec le catalan.
3293 2018-07-16 17:38:39 DIY beauty tips always be like "smear some olive oil on yourself it's good". Like if there is on thing my skin has more than enough of, it's oil, thanks.
3294 2018-07-16 17:38:37 Because he wants lower priced oil
3295 2018-07-16 17:38:31 Keep an eye on oil markets today. Trump is making America dependent again on oil from Russia and the Middle East. Putin and the Saudis are going to break the US shale oil market.
3296 2018-07-16 17:38:18 yesterday I watched a TV show about vampires from 2010 where vampires are genetic and your latent abilities appear if you inject yourself with garlic oil

3297 2018-07-16 17:38:11 Breaking: President Trump has signed over all American land & gold reserves to President Putin's private oil companies. Said to have secured lucrative contract in beans that Trump has labelled "magical beans, the best beans you ever saw, unbelievable beans"

3299 2018-07-16 17:38:02 Seriously mate. It requires roads way into the back country to mine these.  That is much like oil exploration.  You are 100% wrong.
3300 2018-07-16 17:37:54 @TchilaLee person wey get correct oil for head
3301 2018-07-16 17:37:36 The U.S. and Europe have been at peace with Russia since Gorbachov in the 80's.  They keep them publically on the back burner in case they need a quick war, but on the front burner they do billions in illegal uranium sales, while Germany buys 60% of their oil from them!
3302 2018-07-16 17:37:36 Iron rule- no journo should accept public office . Media got to be strong in this country like never before in terms of public service institution- accountability from power weilding positions .  it's not possible to do justice to both the roles. It like missing oil with water

3304 2018-07-16 17:37:13 The report points out: "In 2016, ExxonMobil wrote off more than 4 billion barrels of reserves in the Canadian tar sands.  It is a write down of a full decade of acquisitions in Canada that wrongly assumed ever-increasing oil demand at ever-rising prices".
3305 2018-07-16 17:37:10 If your beautiful miniature makes too many misses in combat during a #40K game, do you quote The Humungus from Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior? :o) The Humungus said "You disappoint me, you puppy" when Max tried to escape the oil refinery compound with full gasoline tanks.

3320 2018-07-16 17:35:50 My bet would be a massive oil and gas deal in exchange for lifting sanctions.  The deal that Mike Flynn was texting about from the inauguration podium.
3321 2018-07-16 17:35:36 Really? I haven't seen those then. Can you post them?
3322 2018-07-16 17:35:31 They didn't hack anything. Spearfishing is not hacking. It's just the equivalent of a dumb human sending $500 to a Nigerian who has a million $ in cash that they would like to send you, but can't afford postage.

You have limited track time o allocate, limited engines and personnel business always goes with the bigger money
3332 2018-07-16 17:34:12 Tell me more about the spectacle.  What would you rather the President do, raise tensions or let cooler heads prevail?  Russia is not the USSR.  Should we be bombing Syria to indirectly affect Russian oil markets or attempting to make peace?

Are you a war hawk like Hillary?

3343 2018-07-16 17:33:07 If you saw the results of my latest blood panel you’d understand how much of a death sentence that would be. My blood is literally McDonald’s fry oil at this point.

3345 2018-07-16 17:33:01 Putin might not be happy. He’s really counting on the oil price increases he’s been enjoying since @realDonaldTrump threw out the Iran Deal and disrupted the oil market.

3353 2018-07-16 17:32:16 French corporations such as the construction company Bolloré, the oil giant Total and the telecoms group Orange maintain a massive presence in the Africa region. French companies import commodities such as uranium ore from Niger and Gabon or cocoa from Ivory Coast.

3359 2018-07-16 17:31:51 There was a $100 drop in crude oil prices during Pres Obama's terms in office, crippling the Russian economy. Since .@realDonaldTrump took office crude oil prices have gone up by $25 extremely helpful to Russia...kinda explains the motivation behind the Tillerson hire .@cspanwj
3360 2018-07-16 17:31:43 No he isn't. What has he given Russia? He increased sanctions. He is pushing 4 other countries not 2 buy their oil.He killed Russians in Syria. He is improving NATO.  Obama  took away missile def systems, gave away uranium and ridiculed anyone who went after Russia.

3363 2018-07-16 17:31:23 Both sides of you're fair. I've seen them

3387 2018-07-16 17:29:24 Calm down, everybody. 

I’m sure Trump only signed over parts of California and most of our oil reserves to Putin. 

Stand By Our President!

3393 2018-07-16 17:28:54 Well done! I felt like the overall takeaway of the #TrumpPutinSummit was a commitment to a working relationship, peace, anti-terrorism, fair competing on trade/oil and cooperating with Mueller to investigate the 12 Russians, using the 1999 treaty. Win/Win for all in the world.

3425 2018-07-16 17:26:04 It makes me sad, Dan, because most of what is taught is false hope, and others with no conviction think no matter what happens, they’ll be fine. But the foolish virgins start running out of oil around midnight, and by then, it’s too late to change their course.
3426 2018-07-16 17:26:03 What is lost in the oil conversation is the fact that gasoline demand is stagnant ---Why? More cars on the road and more people back to work. Technology --cars are much more efficient than just 5 years ago #oott
3427 2018-07-16 17:26:03 Every time i come get my oil changed this guy who knows my dad always calls me “little Bj” (that’s his name). He’s never once asked what my actual name is  I’ve been coming here since i was 16
3428 2018-07-16 17:25:53 Though France has diversified its sources of raw materials, Africa remains an important supplier of oil and metals. “The African continent is our neighbor, and when it’s shaken by conflict, we’re shaken as well,” said a French parliamentarian during a debate on Africa.

3430 2018-07-16 17:25:43 Ireland make more oil storage tanks than any other European nation.  So they'll be just fine.

Oh, and UK exports will look just dandy next month to distract the idiots from reality.
3431 2018-07-16 17:25:41 This is the correct take.

3433 2018-07-16 17:25:16 Be aware of how your Mini runs if you have the oil changed by a service that does not specialize in this particular vehicle. Improper installation of the oil filter will cause the “low pressure” oil light to come on, signaling a need to have the problem fixed.

3447 2018-07-16 17:23:40 With great respect, because I love reading your thoughts, I don't think any of us can know what was talked about in the meeting. My guess would be the Middle East and the leverage we've developed over them in oil and gas figured strongly into their discussions. 1/2

3466 2018-07-16 17:21:27 As we consider the world's resources just how much clean water and oil does Russia have? If we consider global warming, will Russia have more buildable, livable land than other places. What does this look like from a resource standpoint?

Graham,what do U think Putin meant by this, said today at the presser: "We as a major oil and gas power, and the United States as a major oil and gas power as well, can work together on international regulation of markets."Trump just blasted Ger. for getting 35% from Russia.

3478 2018-07-16 17:20:23 Since you’ve seen a doc and tried pain meds, some say peppermint oil can help.
3479 2018-07-16 17:20:21 got chili oil in my eye slurping a noodle at xian's famous foods how's y'all's mondays goin
3480 2018-07-16 17:20:13 Coffee is the second largest traded commodity in the world, oil is the largest. #coffeetrivia #coffee
3481 2018-07-16 17:20:11 Meanwhile Germany buys oil from Russia and France and their leader macron were shaking Putin’s hand and celebrating with him over the weekend. Liberal hypocrites
3482 2018-07-16 17:20:06 Last part. Area bombing by the Western allies crippled production destroyed vast ammounts of raw materials (oil, metals) And effectively brought whole Panzer divisions to a standstill. The wehrmacht could only ove by night in the later years of the war. Contribution was vast.
3483 2018-07-16 17:20:04 Labor participation and getting people not represented  in U3 back to work should be a priority. More effort in pairing workers/skills with jobs and training. A degree, massive debt and wasted working years not mandatory to live American Dream.
3484 2018-07-16 17:20:01 Can someone help me out? I’m confused on the whole essential oil thing? Like do you eat them , drink them, put them on food ? What? Thanks.
3485 2018-07-16 17:19:53 @RealDonaldTrump owes Russian oil oligarch's money. No wonder why he canceled the Iranian nuclear deal.  Gotta keep crude prices high.  #TreasonSummit
3486 2018-07-16 17:19:43 The Friday practice at the 2010 Final Four at Lucas Oil Stadium. There had to be 25,000 people there cheering Butler on as they came out to practice. #Chills
3487 2018-07-16 17:19:41 Shave your legs and oil them up for Me

3488 2018-07-16 17:19:41 I am referring to the oil pipelines Trudeau is pushing through tribal lands despite protests of FN peoples and overwhelming evidence of violence inflicted on Native women by pipeline workers

3490 2018-07-16 17:19:24 Putin says US and Russia have common interest in “regulating” international oil market. Putin Adds “Neither of us is interested in the plummeting of (oil) price and the consumers will suffer as well.” Waiting to hear China or India response...low oil prices not problem for them
3491 2018-07-16 17:19:24 Iran is urging U.S. President Donald Trump not to tap the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to bring oil prices down, but drop the sanctions against Tehran instead
3492 2018-07-16 17:19:16 Feeling like a walking slime ball, smothered in baby oil in an attempt to budge this fake tan
3493 2018-07-16 17:19:15 Getting my oil changed. Preparing myself for news that “I need” something repaired in 5...4...3...
3494 2018-07-16 17:19:12 引火したら、もう手遅れさ…
3495 2018-07-16 17:19:10 Dear Comrade Trump: Russia is not a U.S, competitor. The GDP of California is twice that of Russia's. When oil went from $103 to $30 a barrel Russia panicked like a thankgiving turkey.
3496 2018-07-16 17:19:08 Getting some more oil for my pen Sat & some edibles so excited 
3497 2018-07-16 17:19:08 I’m one.  Great job and keeping more money thx to Tax Cuts. Three kids in State college with summer jobs over $20 hour working concrete, excavation and construction.  In an Oil/Gas producing State with new K-12 schools in EVERY community thx to severance taxes.
3498 2018-07-16 17:19:05 He has several helpful videos on blight if you search Dave's channel and other recommended products for tomatoes. I've been using cold pressed neem oil mixed with water a drop of dish soap, but you can buy neem oil sprays ready to go too. (I learned about it from @growingwisdom)
3499 2018-07-16 17:19:04 If oil company execs can be covered by executive privilege then so can a translator.
3500 2018-07-16 17:18:55 Oh? You think vegan food is gross? Okay, next time you make a meal don’t use any plants. No seasonings, no veggies, no oil, no nothing. Then lmk how gross vegan food is again
3501 2018-07-16 17:18:47 I look forward to the day this backward country gets dragged into the 21st century when will @theresa_may government see the enormous benefits of cannabis oil for sufferers of epilepsy and countless other conditions?
3502 2018-07-16 17:18:31 The root cause of terrorism in the world is America, Russia and their ally Iran, wherever they enter, we find chaos, destruction and death because violence breeds violence and peace generates peace and they did not enter for peace but entered for oil and money.
3503 2018-07-16 17:18:27 I made homemade CBD infused coconut oil. Then replaced all cooking oil with a teaspoon of this. Also nice in hot chocolate before bed 
3504 2018-07-16 17:18:21 Be careful, man. That stuff has cancer causing ingredients. And it was mostly a reply to your hippie oil comment, you know that!
3505 2018-07-16 17:18:17 Dips, Dips, DIPS!!!!
Also just saying- petrol and plastic both come from crude oil so it’s not too bad that Phil got mixed up with them.
3506 2018-07-16 17:18:17 Work for the NDP? Nope. Have never taken one cent from the AB govt under Notley. Nothing from the AB NDP. I have a few NDP MLAs as subscribers, probably a couple hundred bucks/yr. I've made far more speaking to oil/gas companies in Calgary.
3507 2018-07-16 17:18:15 I've been giving away crude oil levels all day long.
3508 2018-07-16 17:18:07 The JERK'S/TERRORIST'S have now started mixing chemicals and crap in my father's New Truck OIL.. So Amazing how much help and finance's these assholes get from OREGON state...
3509 2018-07-16 17:18:03 White Helmets evacuated. Who will produce new fakes? Syrian war is almost over. Idlib, Kurdistan and Deir-ez-Zor oil fields left outside Damascus rule. Did you see how pieces of Syria were reconquered by Assad one by one. His many enemies not united but fractured
3510 2018-07-16 17:17:51 How to make America great again: close down the federal reserve private baking system aka the biggest scam in the history of humanity, stop supporting Israel, re open the investigation of 9/11 and pull the troops out of the Middle East/ stop looting drugs and oil. Yea it’s fucked
3511 2018-07-16 17:17:49 Which coconut oil?
3512 2018-07-16 17:17:47 Put oil on it and keep twisting the ring gently, sorry.
3513 2018-07-16 17:17:35 We can share what Russia doesn't already know;then, they will honor their word, like the word of "the guy they elected for us,"because "we"do it all the time, PBO "let them do it",bc emails,both sides,jobs,oil deals,denuking DPRK,+crapping on allies2extort them.Sumshit.
3514 2018-07-16 17:17:29 Hmmmm, let’s see...linseed oil, paint thinner, pointy tools, spray paint, berets, passionate = emotionally unstable, sees life through rose colored glasses, independent, likes naked people, creatively intelligent AND smarter than an insurance salesperson.
3515 2018-07-16 17:17:28 Spencer, tell me how the UCP is better for Alberta oil. I’ll wait.
3516 2018-07-16 17:17:13 From the beginning, when it was obvious that Trump was getting cozy with Russia, I knew it was about the abundance of oil & gas that Russia & how Trump could make a buck off it.
Trump was always about making a buck & Russia, having trouble unloading it. Trump was the perfect foil
3517 2018-07-16 17:17:09 I live on an island off the coast of Venezuela. We get economic refugees all the time.
Worse yet, the oil refinery here is being leased by them until 2019 and we cant find someone else to lease it to afterwards since they neglected to properly maintain it for 40 years.
3518 2018-07-16 17:17:02 Neither Russia or the US needs the Middle Easts oil!!
3519 2018-07-16 17:16:56 We’d never survive with all this oil hanging round our neck like a noose 
3520 2018-07-16 17:16:44 That would inconvenience the oil companies so I don’t see that happening
3521 2018-07-16 17:16:31 I definitely used to put 2.5wt oil (instead of 5wt) in mine and other small riders' motion control dampers, but the charger is a different beast.
3522 2018-07-16 17:16:27 Calling the Putin Summit a 'Missed Opportunity' to hold Putin accountable for hacking is like calling the Deepwater Horizon oil spill a missed opportunity to have oysters for dinner.
3523 2018-07-16 17:16:15 Best ones here, Wife uses the oil fryer, then sautees them in a combination of vinegar, butter and hot wing sauces for 3 minutes.  VERY fattening thou, we have been eating the frozen-bag o wings from the air fryer for the past year. That and potatoes makes the air fryer worth it.
3524 2018-07-16 17:16:09 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, and enforce our laws.
3525 2018-07-16 17:16:04 Wall Street flat as oil slump offsets earnings optimism: Wall Street was mostly flat on Monday as a slump in oil prices dragged energy shares lower, offsetting a jump in financial stocks after Bank of America's strong results reinforced expectations of earnings growth for U.S.…
3526 2018-07-16 17:15:56 CBD oil is great for inflammation. There's a ton of research for colitis, chron's & IBS relief using CBD oil. Better then taking a bunch of medication, it's like putting a bandaid on the problem. CBD oil not only relieves the symptoms, it heals
3527 2018-07-16 17:15:54 Do you produce palm oil
3528 2018-07-16 17:15:50 Try buying baby spinach. Sautéed in olive oil and garlic is the simplest sand best way in my opinion.
3529 2018-07-16 17:15:47 Coconut oil is the worst for my hair omg
3530 2018-07-16 17:15:32 I have genetic crippling disorder that causes a lot of pain. Know several epileptics who are now seizure free with a couple drops of CBD oil under tongue. So I tried it. Wow. Pain level went from 9 to 2!Med pot works.CBD makes no High!Anti-inflammatory.
3531 2018-07-16 17:15:29 Absolutely gorgeous Hun xx just wish I was there to rub that oil in 
3532 2018-07-16 17:15:14 oil is just collapsing and no one even talking about
3533 2018-07-16 17:15:04 I don’t trust places that sale oil and all the oils be the same color. You mean to tell me all these oils are green? No.

3536 2018-07-16 17:14:56 Same thing at @CNBC the anchor there was trying to deflect to German oil from Russia.
3537 2018-07-16 17:14:54 You know the next thing you will see is Trump telling us we need to get our oil from Russia instead of the middle east. #HowMuchMoneyHasRussiaInvestedInTrumpOrganixation @TrueFactsStated @kurteichenwald @LouiseMensch @Kokomothegreat @karolcummins
3538 2018-07-16 17:14:46 Congressional republicans who spent the 4th in Moscow will now call for the lifting of sanctions. Exxonn/Tillerson's half trillion Siberian oil deal can then move forward

3543 2018-07-16 17:14:23 If you can hold off on filling your tank, #gasprices are likely to start or continue marching lower in most states in the week ahead. #Oil selloff continuing this week, WTI $68/bbl and falling.
3544 2018-07-16 17:14:22 That’s not what he said!! The opposite is his proposal to keep prices at artificially high levels to prop up the oil and gas industries of Russia and US. More collusion against US workers by the International Oligarchs.
3545 2018-07-16 17:14:19 I swear every time I take my car in for just an oil change it turns into something else. $200 later…
3546 2018-07-16 17:14:19 Trump couldn’t even answer the question about the supplying of oil from Russia to Germany.
3547 2018-07-16 17:14:03 別の趣味アカを友達に何故かフォローされたのだが、声掛けるか放置するか迷う
3548 2018-07-16 17:13:58 I also spend a lot of time on BC radio defending the oil sands and pipelines for no money. I'm a big fan BECAUSE oil sands CEOs, AB govt policy are committed to lowering carbon-intensity, emissions and that message sells really well outside Alberta.

This man has been compromised. He SHOULD not be leading our free, beautiful country. Impeachment now!
3553 2018-07-16 17:12:44 Cuz, the best thing invented basically a fryer that doesn't use oil, can make anything in there friend chicken, burgers, steak, fries. But basically healthy friend foods
3554 2018-07-16 17:12:43 Douala in the Littoral region, will be or is the headquarters of the controversial British company, New Age that will be operating the Eteinde oil wells off Victoria-Limbe  in the SWR after licence was granted by Cameroon government. And Tabe Tando Mbi, is slated to be its GM.

God, this shit is so boringly transparent. Where the hell are the generals, the Pentagon, the *anyone*?
3561 2018-07-16 17:11:48 Just reminding that US government does not control how much oil gets produced in America, private companies and investors do. Administration can tinker at margins with export permits for LNG or royalty rates/permitting regulations. BL US oil and gas is private, not govt run
3562 2018-07-16 17:11:47 1. Javelins in Ukraine 2. Calmed the Fat Man 3. Shown the strength of the US in Deir ez Zor 4. Bombed the airport after the chemical attack of Assad 5. He lowered the price of oil...

3564 2018-07-16 17:11:25 I have a term for when the USTreasury/Fed have a coordinated News/HFT effort to hit Au or Oil. I call it a "Pavlovian Fade" & the very best Fade is when the Treasury provides the news to accompany the HFT sell bombing like today's Mnuchin story on Iran. But truth is HFT not news.

baths in peppermint oil and epsin salt.
3569 2018-07-16 17:10:55 Another point was he got Trump to nod to higher oil prices ... something that hurts the US economy but helps the Russian one. Putin expertly reigned it in a little while later saying too high is not good also.
3570 2018-07-16 17:10:40 He’s not, he’s a snake oil salesman selling his fad to vulnerable individuals. I’m afraid you’ll have to sell copies by other means Lewis, your bot accounts don’t work round these parts
3571 2018-07-16 17:10:30 (Alsumeria) Power line to West Qurna oil field destroyed with an IED.

3576 2018-07-16 17:10:03 45* is a coconspirator. Hes been indebted to Putin since the $1T oil deal made with he and Rex Tillerson in 2013.
3577 2018-07-16 17:09:58 More to your question: 1) MMT doesn't see reserve currency as binary, 2) this is partially why MMT emphasizes full employment of domestic resources. 3) in US at least, we can expand social services enormously with few new imports. 4) If we don't quit oil nothing else will matter.
3578 2018-07-16 17:09:54 oil vs amzn?
3579 2018-07-16 17:09:53 @LBC how anyone can still support brexit sold by snake oil salesmen who are now moaning that TM deal takes away powers they stated in the EU ref we didn’t have! People like garage who said brexit would be great and easy giving no plan or evidence are now saying we’ll survive

3581 2018-07-16 17:09:27 Ah, I don't remember there being sunflower oil and coconut in the ingredients before.  If I'm going mental and it's always contained those ingredients, I guess it must just be a strange batch. The current jar is so runny it's almost like oil vs. the usual thick spread. Thanks!
3582 2018-07-16 17:09:25 Diplomatic efforts? What diplomatic efforts?  There were no diplomatic efforts on display today.  Russia is a frigging 3rd world country with oil and nukes.  That's it.  And, the POTUS of the US sold us out to them today.
3583 2018-07-16 17:09:21 Are the oil speculators jewish
3584 2018-07-16 17:09:18 People open their eyes during that?
3585 2018-07-16 17:09:03 Imagine their economy without an international oil market

3588 2018-07-16 17:08:50 Where is your outrage for the tankers trudging up and down the st Lawrence Mike? Every one knows you are a paid schill to block Canadian oil. How about the coal barges that leave B.C. ports every day? Nothing but crickets..
3589 2018-07-16 17:08:48 Forgetting to put beard oil in is equivalent to forgetting to put deodorant on.
3590 2018-07-16 17:08:47 Yea! Even boli goes well with it. A pinch of salt in the oil 
3591 2018-07-16 17:08:43 Your skin forms a thick barrier that germs cannot cross unless d skin gets cut.Glands in d skin secrete sweat & oily fluid (sebum) both repel germs. An area of skin d size of a postage stamp has about 500 sweat glands. Sometimes oil glands get blocked & swell up creating a pimple
3592 2018-07-16 17:08:42 Any one else tired of @TeamCavuto? Once Varney is over, I'm back to CNBC. I need business news not his Never Trump drivel. He's having a cow and the markets just stay flat. Oil drops, and he's off on a rant.
3593 2018-07-16 17:08:23 This is what you get when you combine an undereducated, gullible and provincial populace with a snake oil salesman.
3594 2018-07-16 17:08:20 I agree. I felt like the overall takeaway of the #TrumpPutinSummit was a commitment to a working relationship, peace, anti-terrorism, fair competing on trade/oil and cooperating with Mueller to investigate the 12 Russians, using the 1999 treaty. Win/Win for all in the world.

3600 2018-07-16 17:07:32 I done thought this was a real commercial
3601 2018-07-16 17:07:29 Trump is far harder on Putin than obama ever was. Sanctioned Putin’s son in law. Best friend. And largest oil oligarch. Plus another 220 more. Obama two dozen over 8 years and gave ample warning before freezing assets. Obama wouldn’t sell arms to Ukraine. Trump is.
3602 2018-07-16 17:07:19 I’m sick of getting oil changes.

3607 2018-07-16 17:07:00 Sanders absolutely should be on this list. There were a lot of reasons 2016 didn't go well—Sanders is one of the biggest. He's a phoney, snake oil salesman duping college kids out of their $27 while blaming the rich for all our problems.
3608 2018-07-16 17:06:55 お疲れ様でした！おやすみなさい
3609 2018-07-16 17:06:50 I’m ready to throw out everything I own with coconut oil. My poor fucking face
3610 2018-07-16 17:06:45 I always wanted to be brown and rather foolishly would sunbathe slavered in oil!
Now I’m all about the factor 50 and wrinkle avoidance!
3611 2018-07-16 17:06:44 2/regular readers know I'm a fan of Notley's energy/climate policies, esp re the oil sands and a critic of the UCP approach. My analysis is based upon dozens of interviews w/respected experts over the past 5 years. Happy to explain my position to any group, any time.
3612 2018-07-16 17:06:39 จริงงงงงงง แบบ เฮ้ย อะไรกัน พวกเธอขยับแบบนั้นได้อย่างไร~~~
3613 2018-07-16 17:06:36 I bet you think if you don't buy gas on a specific day you will cripple the oil and gas companies too. These are some if the largest companies in the world with more resources than you could ever imagine. They will just replace them with someone else that want to do the job.
3614 2018-07-16 17:06:36 At this point, would it be appropriate to align with all countries for the purpose of progress and not fighting for oil and resources when we could use military salary for research into other reusable resources.
3615 2018-07-16 17:06:34 In the 2000s the style marketed to guys was the "Ultra-Modern Suave Metro Guy" (think Axe, Ed Hardy, Affliction, etc.) 

In the 2010s it's the "Rustic Rugged 1800s Guy" (think Bourbon Maple Tobacco Beard Oil Handcrafted By Former US Marines) 

Style predictions for the 2020s:
3616 2018-07-16 17:06:34 We can produce more oil so we can bring it down on our own
3617 2018-07-16 17:06:23 @ImanAbdulRahim  kalau malam nak pakai sunflower face oil and corrective dark spot solution... nak selit step mne..?
3618 2018-07-16 17:06:20 Oil is already running out in lighter
My stomach is nervously burning inside

Meltdown, iroha
3619 2018-07-16 17:06:19 うゎーーーい！w
3620 2018-07-16 17:06:17 Talking is better than kissing or fighting. Credit where credit is due. Putin won on points with his lecture to Trump. No change in Syria both sides continue to back their puppets. No compromising record of TrumpsMoscow partners,oil competition-nothing new (Middle East conflicts)
3621 2018-07-16 17:06:06 That's frickin sweet.
3622 2018-07-16 17:06:06 So you have no idea then? That’s what you’re saying? That’s your telling me; that you have no idea how applying coconut oil to the skin can heal the gut bacteria you say cures eczema? Ok then, that makes all 4 us.
3623 2018-07-16 17:05:57 @DavidDavisMP well done David, tell the house the reality. #BrexitFudge #Parliament

3627 2018-07-16 17:05:29 I’ve gotten my oil changed, renewed my registration and gotten new tires with no prompting from my Dad... where is my prize?!????
3628 2018-07-16 17:05:25 I lived through Heath's humiliation by the Arab oil shock, miners' strike and three-day week, Callaghan calling in IMF and winter of discontent and Lamont's Black Wednesday. They all felt as bad or worse at the time. Leaderless panicked governments at the mercy of events.
3629 2018-07-16 17:05:23 
3630 2018-07-16 17:05:05 My cousin lives in Istra - the oil there is the best!
3631 2018-07-16 17:05:04 #Oil continues to fall as predicted where everyone else was screaming it was going to hit $100. 

How does a local radio station get it right but the #MSM get it so wrong?
3632 2018-07-16 17:05:01 Globalization has ended the idea of WW3 because corporate rule is in control. Crimea is the proof. The corrupted Bank of Crimea owed Russia a lot of oil money so international business stood by while Russia collected a debt. Big oil knew the game, collect oil money by foreclosing
3633 2018-07-16 17:04:58 寝たら仕事が始まってしまう〜〜
3634 2018-07-16 17:04:57 Oh yeah, coconut oil, coconut water, gin and coconut, pina colada, and natural coconuts!!!!
3635 2018-07-16 17:04:55 Bush's war for oil and global domination. Look into it.
3636 2018-07-16 17:04:43 trump working with foreign powers he bluffs they act its about destroying US Economy causing US Companies to fold.Trump IS Owned by Russia,Saudi and China and they want our Companies ,Land and they will demand DT DRILL NEW OIL AND GAS WELLS and with US broke they fund and own
3637 2018-07-16 17:04:32 Looooll  I mostly use rosehip oil but lately I’ve been trying castor oil and it’s so good!
3638 2018-07-16 17:04:31 Oil breaking :270 points down today , trading @ 67.33
3639 2018-07-16 17:04:25 Or spell out exactly how we may retaliate?? Make statements that will never be overtly followed through on? Let thwm know we found a soft target to hit em in?? Thats not how it works
3640 2018-07-16 17:04:07 Try an oil free primer, I like the Ordinary one or @smashboxuk one 
3641 2018-07-16 17:04:07 Trump used for and competitor interchangeably. He was referencing the pipeline deal between Germany and Russia so from an oil/gas perspective he's technically right.
3642 2018-07-16 17:04:00 #oott   more bonny light, more saudia oil to asia, more SPR oil , more iranian oil to india and china ... it is a more day

3650 2018-07-16 17:03:31 There is only one question on my mind
Where did Dolph get all of that body oil?
3651 2018-07-16 17:03:27 have you seen mine???? im a whole fried egg throwing all that oil at you realness honey

3655 2018-07-16 17:03:14 hardly saw Putin's hand pulling his puppet's strings. Russia is doing the oil  sanctions dance

3657 2018-07-16 17:02:33 The Russian economy is small and dependent on continued marketability of fossil fuels. Their only path to power is dividing the rest of the world. Trump is a symptom of the success of their disease. Fight it: Divest from oil now. Restore our Democracy
3658 2018-07-16 17:02:29 Don’t forget oil!  You want embargo Iran to cut off oil revenue but allow some oil importers continue to import oil from Iran.  Which is it?  Are you for or against embargo?  I am against it.  What about you?
3659 2018-07-16 17:02:23 Bolivian women aren't particularly "empowered" you know. Western pseudo intellectuals who use vague discourse about a made up condition of some far away group of people just to fit their narrative or agenda are really sneak oil salesmen.
3660 2018-07-16 17:02:22 She "hiccuped" for a minute, then used subsequent tweets to justify her original argument.  I'd have to agree with you.

3664 2018-07-16 17:02:01 .@KelseyDav: a lot of Iran’s benefit under deal was through oil sales - if sales continue to Europe, China India and others, the deal might limp along. Best case scenario for ‘18.
3665 2018-07-16 17:01:57 100% up
3666 2018-07-16 17:01:56 It’s always about oil... Netanyahu, Saudi Arabia, Syria, etc. etc. you think we’re aiding in war crimes against Yemen by Saudi Arabia just for shits and giggles?  Why do you think he initially stocked the White House with everyone connected to oil?
3667 2018-07-16 17:01:47 Thing is Russia didn't pioneer this, oil companies had been doing it for years to spread climate denial, and I noticed a ton of accounts who were against net neutrality on reddit all of a sudden, which could only be explained as paid trolls (and people tricked by them)
3668 2018-07-16 17:01:43 Dad: *looks at moms mileage & her sticker for next oil change*

“You’re 1500 miles overdue for an oil change?!”

Mom: “what? I was waiting for that light to turn on. I thought I was doing really good.”

Dad: “THERES LITERALLY A STICKER IS RIGHT HERE. IT TELLS YOU.”

3669 2018-07-16 17:01:37 What we are missing by not having Killiary as prez. High taxes, open borders, russiagate investigation, elimination of coal, oil, paying for Paris climate accords, Muslim mass migration. #TGFTRUMP
3670 2018-07-16 17:01:30 I didn't feel that way at all. I just stated my opinion and you optic fanboys got your panties in a bunch. I'm chillin bro lol I'm currently having a glass of high quality red wine with a 100% organic thc oil cart in beautiful weather. Wyd?

3673 2018-07-16 17:01:15 I didn’t like the sound of this at all, it sounds as if they are going to join forces against the rest of the world. They’re talking about nuclear weapons in space and a monopoly on oil and gas production.... fuck this is worse than I thought.
3674 2018-07-16 17:01:12 They are OK with taking money from Russian lobbyist though to buy democrat politicians. They are OK with Europe buying gas and oil from them as we sanction Russian for meddling. They were OK with selling them 20% of our Uranium too.
3675 2018-07-16 17:00:59 Bought @jrliggettShampo and love it as it is a bar and saves so many plastic bottles if I can keep it up. BUT it has palm kernel oil and I don’t know the source and boycott that oil unless sustainably sourced. Asked on @iHerb and nobody responded. Also bar soap not pumps.

3678 2018-07-16 17:00:47 Hey, I'm all for you pulling out of NATO. Go fight your own resource wars and proxy fights. When's the last time Canada declared war on someone sitting on "their" oil?
3679 2018-07-16 17:00:38 david and I are at the fancy ass car place getting an oil change and our ragamuffin asses do not belong here
3680 2018-07-16 17:00:37 @FoxBusiness Russia has a 1 Trillion USD natural gas / oil fuel driven annual economy. America has a 22 Trillion USD annual economy. What economic benefits justify @realDonaldTrump not standing with the 19 Trillion EU annual economy? Americans want to sell to European markets!
3681 2018-07-16 17:00:36 Atropian oil isn't worth American blood

3689 2018-07-16 17:00:21 btw this took me years to figure out, but you can fry delicious tofu if you:

Get nice firm tofu & unpackage.
Cover with paper towels and squeeze lightly
Dice the tofu up and dab with more paper towels
Roll pieces around in cornstarch
Fry coated pieces in oil, flipping as needed

3698 2018-07-16 16:58:50 Having a car is pretty convenient in all until it needs gas, or new tires or an oil change.
3699 2018-07-16 16:58:45 I believe that. The climate is changing but why concern ourselves with frying to death when's there dirty tar sands oil to be sold? dirty oil pipelines to be built? #foosilfuelindustry shareholders to make rich beyond their greediest dreams?!
3700 2018-07-16 16:58:39 You can also take some of the used oil and put it in your radiator to help keep things lubed up in there too, like your thermostat

I said- “Wesley, that is an oil well. Do you know what an oil well does?”

He replied- “It goes up and down and it makes money.”

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said some oil buyers could get waivers to continue buying Iranian supplies despite American sanctions on the Middle Eastern country.

3744 2018-07-16 16:55:14 To note, those not understanding France's affinity for their dated film - the French view cinema as much an artform as oil painting or sculpture, you dont chuck it out because it's older. Paris is dotted with movie houses that play old classic films.

3764 2018-07-16 16:53:35 All true. Just sayin the oil is there. And consumers would be pissed, but at the same time there would be oceans of money being made and high paid blue collar jobs to salve those high gas prices. Paying $5/gallon doesn’t feel so bad when you’re making $150k w a GED.
3765 2018-07-16 16:53:35 oil price is effecting some , we held for awhile without droping more as oil fell so i`m a beleiver we r at a reasonabley strong suport right here
3766 2018-07-16 16:53:30 Yes!  I've been a hater of plastic since the 70's.  Working PT in Dominion Stores we were made to force people to take the plastic bags and refuse them the paper bags they wanted!  Plastic is an oil produce and NEVER in my microwave.   I'm for GLASS AND PAPER!

3771 2018-07-16 16:53:08 The "competitor" comment was made in context of Oil+Gas production, where Russia really IS a global competitor. It was one of the rare lucid moments in the entire press conference. There are A MILLION other things that were more alarming in the press conference than this.

3774 2018-07-16 16:52:58 We conservatively assume that he and his family alone have embezzled around US$ 500 million from #SouthernCameroons oil revenue. Not accounted the money his predecessor Ahidjo and the +200 ministers stole from the people of #Ambazonia.
3775 2018-07-16 16:52:58 Music to my ears! But that would be too much like right. Besides he still has work to do for putin. Putin would forbid don to leave b4 sancs lift & gas & oil money. Don’s back is against the wall so we still haven’t seen anything yet. Just wait for it bc there’s more to come.
3776 2018-07-16 16:52:55 Stocks drift, rates lift & oil slips. US stocks sideways with relative weakness seen in the small caps & transports. The energy complex suffered losses with a continuation of the decline in crude prices. Treasury yields lifted both in Europe & US resulting curve steepening.
3777 2018-07-16 16:52:46 Re: the guard smoking by the oil drums. Those look like they might be AV gas, it's got a REALLY high point. Super hard to set alight, FYI
3778 2018-07-16 16:52:39 Yep. Capacities are very handy when pricing a job. Again capacities are not always listed. I am safe in knowledge that ye can supply oil for pretty much any car. 
3779 2018-07-16 16:52:36 The part I saw he was telling everyone that he didn't think the German/Russia pipeline was a good idea and that the US would be competing with Russia on gas & oil supply contracts. All of this in front of Putin. Doesn't sound like a puppet.

3785 2018-07-16 16:52:01 Texas Oil soon to be GIVEN to Russia.
3786 2018-07-16 16:51:51 Mexico is right in one respect. The appetite for drugs and illegal labor in the United States makes illegal trafficking a lucrative business.  In Mexico rule of law is sparse. This will not change anytime soon.
3787 2018-07-16 16:51:51 @OutnumberedFNC what would the result be if we condemned of his meddling? Should we not have diplomatic relations with Israel because Obama meddled in their election? I say supply all of Europe with oil and Russia will be brought to their knees and problem solved
3788 2018-07-16 16:51:45 1.- Eso lo sabe cualquiera que conozca PEMEX. 
The revamp will allow Pemex to place more than 100,000 b/d of Mayan heavy crude on the U.S. market. Mayan accounts for 70% of Mexico's crude oil exports.

3791 2018-07-16 16:51:32 @OutnumberedFNC Trump already tried to get Germany to stop buying oil/natural gas from Russia.  That in itself would rain economic hell down on Russia!  It is better that there is a dialouge between us an Russia, than all out War!

3799 2018-07-16 16:50:47 As an American I trust the @FBI investigators. Putin is trying to get out the single digit oil fuel driven economy by helping Trump get elected. The Russian 1 trillion rubble economy prompted Putin to interfere with the powerful US economy, 22 trillion annually.

3817 2018-07-16 16:49:11 I agree we are exchanging one set of problems for another. Are you willing to make the choice from oil to solar wind and geothermal ? The idea of people never having to spend money again after the systems are in place really appeals to me.
3818 2018-07-16 16:49:10 Define medicine.....Did you hear about the boy who was dying after years of allopathic medicine and his Mother sneaked him cannabis oil? He recovered. Your medicine failed him..it's a charade. Chemo = Poison
3819 2018-07-16 16:49:02 anyone whose been paying even a modicum of attention to geopolitics in the past 5 years is well aware that Russia is a country that has to rely on imperialism and espionage for its power. They don’t produce anything besides oil.
3820 2018-07-16 16:48:57 A little bit underreported: Putin suggested in the news conference that Russia and the U.S could install something rival to OPEC on oil and gas
3821 2018-07-16 16:48:56 I totally agree with Trump. All this poopoo has been to salvage Hillarys fragile ego and to start a war with Russia.  Other great powers are trying to thwart Russia expansion into other territories, not to mention oil and gas war which Saudi has an interest in.  Of course
3822 2018-07-16 16:48:51 US reportedly plans to block Iranian oil exports in a few months.
3823 2018-07-16 16:48:37 @realDonaldTrump You failed to get the keys to St Petersburg. 
You did succeed in handing over the entire United States to Putin.

3825 2018-07-16 16:48:27 The Russian Media asked about Syria and Russian Oil.  The American Press asked if Putin had Dirt on Trump and If he liked Trump over Hilary.  What an embarrassment to the US.  Our Press are idiots.  They asked nothing important.  Nothing about Nuclear Weapons or Syria!

How come early oil wells used oil-fired steam engines instead of wind turbines to pull up oil? It's all about #EROI.

3832 2018-07-16 16:48:02 Literally everything is about oil in one way or another.
3833 2018-07-16 16:47:59 Thus Mr. Moore is perpetuating the lie of government with this tweet. Basically, if we attacked either Russia or China, we'd be attacking our own corporations. Globalization has ended the idea of WW3. Even Crimea did not produce a WW3 over oil money owed to Russia by Crimea.

3848 2018-07-16 16:46:34 She hit it spot on; Trump made a deal with the devil and so did many of the GOP to sell out America, all financed by big oil.
3849 2018-07-16 16:46:34 I find it odd. He acts tough towards the EU. But kisses the ass if Russia and North Korea.. yet during his campaign he was all tough and mighty to them.. I said it once and I will say it again. He is a snake oil salesman

3861 2018-07-16 16:45:52 I love working for BMW but man idk who thought the fancy electric oil level measured was a good idea. Literally if you just have a dipstick in the car you can measure the oil in like 10 seconds, but instead you sit there waiting for 5 minutes for the car to measure it

3868 2018-07-16 16:45:13 I’m wracking my brain to understand this from the chance that there is/was no collusion or meddling. Let’s for a moment suppose there wasn’t. What then is his end game here? What’s in it for Trump as relates to MAGA? We don’t need oil. Or am I just posturing an absurd question...
3869 2018-07-16 16:45:11 Grow & thicken your beard with our Shari Richi raw Jamaican castor oil. We recommend using a small amount twice daily & massage gently into beard. #sharirichi #sharirichicastoroil #sharirichiuganda #castoroil #haircare
3870 2018-07-16 16:45:10 Sun is the worst thing you can do to your skin. Had a bad sunburn once on a holiday in Greeece and the local Dr.prescripted simple olive oil.Very  effective, but greasy and smelling. Takes away the burning pain..
3871 2018-07-16 16:45:00 はえ〜〜〜神じゃん行こ行こ
3872 2018-07-16 16:45:00 The Queen of the South is such a stubborn goat head of Egypt that oil and wine isn’t enough for her to transform. The oil must be burning like 7 torches from the fully formed Lion of Judah in the Sons of God in order for her sorceries to be incinerated into the Lake of Fire.
3873 2018-07-16 16:45:00 @SenWarren did you say the same thing when @BarackObama met with the Saudi’s? American fully supports that dictatorship who hangs women for driving a car. Oh right they have oil!
3874 2018-07-16 16:44:48 Haha..I'm guessing that has something to do with coconut oil, since it supposedly does everything.
3875 2018-07-16 16:44:45 And castor oil too
3876 2018-07-16 16:44:39 He is the slimiest snake oil salesman I’ve ever come across and I’m ashamed he was born in Scotland .
3877 2018-07-16 16:44:31 So Brit, what's he supposed to do?  Since #Trump doesn't enjoy #Obama's incurious, worshipful #media coverage (or #Putin's fearful, trembling press), should he:
A. Try, however ineffectively, to pour just a little oil on troubled waters; or
B.  Punch Putin in the mouth?
3878 2018-07-16 16:44:28 Illegal immigration and so called asylum seekers entering the country between ports of entry enrich cartels. Democrats are complicit because NOBODY crosses the border without paying. Advocates for illegals encourage, enable and perpetuate this activity.
3879 2018-07-16 16:44:23 Could somebody please change the nuclear weapon launch codes and tell all US and allied undercover agents to bug out of Russia and Syria? Trump is probably leaking like a BP oil rig. #TreasonSummit
3880 2018-07-16 16:44:18 *grumpy pig noises*

The fan in my power supply is revving like an impatient racecar driver. Ordering some syringes and sewing machine oil to try an fix it since it's in the PSUs impenetrable black box.
3881 2018-07-16 16:44:17 I’m mad because apparently all this time I’ve just had normal/combo skin and I always thought I had oily skin. But the oil only collects on my nose. Everything else is normally okay, unless I’m dehydrated. But the caveat is I am extremely sensitive to everything. 
3882 2018-07-16 16:44:08 IT IS THE MODEL USED IN VENEZUELA BY CHAVEZ AND CASTRO - drive out oil and gas investment FIRST, diminish agriculture by driving out farmers, etc.
3883 2018-07-16 16:44:06 Oil and gas was mentioned in Putin’s speech! Sanctions have to be lifted for that to happen! He is desperate for that to happen!! Trump is a TRAITOR!!!!
3884 2018-07-16 16:44:00 Putin asked him to relieve the oil embargo on Iran.  President Puppet Trump immediately complied.  The easing of russian sanctions will come in a couple weeks when the news cycle picks up on the next scandal.
3885 2018-07-16 16:43:49 "The whitest and phoniest things in the world cannot be pursued or even ingested - they must be kissed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
3886 2018-07-16 16:43:49 I don’t feel like driving anywhere today, but I’m due for an oil change so I really need to drag myself to the shop.
3887 2018-07-16 16:43:49 Bhujiya balances all that oil free fat free. Infact more. So zyada khush matt ho aap 
3888 2018-07-16 16:43:44 Plus when we get cheap solar panels that can fit on the roofs of cars and homes, we will all have our own power plant basically on our house, and the need for oil will decrease dramatically. We need a government that funds the science, not one that taxes solar panels.
3889 2018-07-16 16:43:43 THIS IS WHY I SHOULD NEVER GO GET MY OIL CHANGED ALONE
3890 2018-07-16 16:43:36 "Peter gets an oil change for his car" has turned into "the oil filter is on so tight they're having to crack it apart to remove it" #theweekwhereeverythingbreaks
3891 2018-07-16 16:43:32 Hugely grateful to the small children at this garage for monopolizing the television so I don't have to watch the news while I wait for an oil change
3892 2018-07-16 16:43:32 Massage it on there , put oil first then conditioner . And if your hair is slicked back pull it off from the front like a hat
3893 2018-07-16 16:43:23 We see u relaxing all nice Steve I hear yeah But Steve we got 2 see the Mrs also relaxing so How Come she isn’t Laying on a beach chair n u rubbing her back with some good smelling oil Cause she also works hard Taking Care of U Steve (Just saying )
3894 2018-07-16 16:43:16 I wouldn't parboil them either because it would be very easy to overcook them. Don't expect them to crisp up like ordinary potatoes because they have a much higher water content. I'd simply chop them and drizzle olive oil before you bake them. Should be done around 25 minutes.
3895 2018-07-16 16:43:15 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!

3898 2018-07-16 16:42:47 i'm looking forward to seeing tony hayward in hell.  it's hotter than an ocean full of hot oil down here.
3899 2018-07-16 16:42:46 Another service done with all Bel Ray fluids.  Synthetic oil that has proven to be a top performer!
3900 2018-07-16 16:42:34 Just a fyi I can get the sss original bath oil in 16.9 oz $7.99 my order goes off tonight

3903 2018-07-16 16:42:21 Fuel flexibility include heavy black oil,diesel and Jet A1 and Kerosene.
3904 2018-07-16 16:41:58 Beard oil ordered
3905 2018-07-16 16:41:57 Do I go sunbathing today and lather myself in baby oil?
3906 2018-07-16 16:41:51 Saw the drop 30 minutes ago. Nice bit of relief, but still can't be explained by actual oil prices and supplies. More like collisions, shitty policies, poor investor confidence in the country.
3907 2018-07-16 16:41:50 It's like Big Oil convincing the world straws are the actual problem.
3908 2018-07-16 16:41:48 I blame oil, and the protection of Zionism and influence of the state of Saudi Arabia (notice how I don't blame religions) in recent US adventures...
3909 2018-07-16 16:41:46 I’m done w flower fr fr these oil plugs got me fucked
3910 2018-07-16 16:41:45 pasta with olive oil is a godsend.
3911 2018-07-16 16:41:38 I listened to a review and heard they might not be run in fully, but to run it in as you would do on s car that isn't ect. Like multiple rpm's no sitting in one gear for ages and no using Launch control + change oil at 1000 miles
3912 2018-07-16 16:41:34 We need to kill the oil industry, so I'm down for this.
3913 2018-07-16 16:41:18 Is that oil on his fingers
3914 2018-07-16 16:41:16 Anybody that destroys what's left Pedo-desta's reputation is a hero.
3915 2018-07-16 16:41:15 I usually cut them into wedges, dry but don’t parboil. Put into a bag with rapeseed oil/salt/paprika, shake and turn out onto lined baking tray. Extra tasty if you have some parmesan to dust over them. :)
If you didn’t want a recipe, ignore this. 
3916 2018-07-16 16:41:10 Caranya pakenya gimana biar jadi cleansing oil?
3917 2018-07-16 16:41:08 Yes indeed, our resources are beyond oil but people focus on oil because it’s already in production stage. The remaining resources are still unexplored or not highly commercialized.
3918 2018-07-16 16:40:48 Where's the money coming from the OIL of course your OIL
3919 2018-07-16 16:40:44 I don't even have a lamp oil to lose, but i've still decided that im the king!
3920 2018-07-16 16:40:32 #Groundreporting @HRDMinistry @TOITopStories V lacks consistent HR mgt policy or reaping benefits of demography.y now u hv scraped 8th class board exams. It had badly destroyed my childhood days n  happiness.Burned mid-night oil to pass, beaten brutally by teachers.

3924 2018-07-16 16:40:26 haan aur except bhujiya its oil free and fat free
3925 2018-07-16 16:40:26 Pres @realDonaldTrump should remind #Putin that Texas - 1 of 50 states - has a larger economy than his entire country. Texans are also better armed than his (thanks to #freedom), and may even surpass Russia's oil & gas production very soon. #GodBlessTexas #txlege
3926 2018-07-16 16:40:20 The issue of #FuelPriceHike doesnt work with who is the president even if Donald Trump was SA president we will be experiencing the same since SA doest produce crude oil,So lets stop blaming the hikes on Cyril Ramaphosa...
3927 2018-07-16 16:40:18 Neat. During the press conference Putin says that he wants to work with @realDonaldTrump to price-fix the global oil market. #TreasonSummit
3928 2018-07-16 16:40:17 I’ve been putting coconut oil on my lashes for the past months and I’m seeing progress 
3929 2018-07-16 16:40:12 いや…ちょ、やめろっ！耳からはさすがに油飲めないから！

3937 2018-07-16 16:39:05 Engine is benchmarked from factory but taking it easy on the clutch, gearbox etc. Always watching oil levels but no plans to change yet 
3938 2018-07-16 16:38:59 Need to a spray up. Citronella eucalyptus lavender tea tree oil and water. It’s really good
3939 2018-07-16 16:38:58 Argan, rosehip, almond (although unsure about almond, check on that) but coconut oil is for neck down  plus it’s only spf 7 ;)
3940 2018-07-16 16:38:56 Alright now, Haiti has OIL, more oil than Venezuela. Haiti’s oil is a swimming pool to Venezuela’s cup of water. Haiti is on 4 tectonic plates producing that oil. All these “natural disasters” are not quite natural (HAARP).

3943 2018-07-16 16:38:33 @myslutbox @DaRealAmberRose does not disappoint. I love the lip plumper, body glitter, essential oil spray, and hair care product that protects your hair from chlorine and salt water! I can’t wait for next month’s box! #myslutbox
3944 2018-07-16 16:38:27 tea tree oil diluted w a lil water
3945 2018-07-16 16:38:25 You'd get to keep the oil th... oh
3946 2018-07-16 16:38:12 Lmao why don’t you do a real protest and get rid of your car your shoes your toothpaste toothbrush every single thing that is made with a petroleum product.  Don’t drink any bottled water. Be real everything you own is made from a byproduct of oil.
3947 2018-07-16 16:38:02 I don't buy it for one second.  I'd buy snake oil first.  They're all as corrupt as he is and they don't want to lose their jobs, their salaries, their taxpayer perks, their free health coverage, and their great tax breaks!!!!!
3948 2018-07-16 16:38:02 Finna go get an oil change.
3949 2018-07-16 16:38:01 The BS market headline today, markets flat with weak oil prices at 69/ barrel
3950 2018-07-16 16:37:59 So....who on my friends list has NOT tried CBD oil yet???
3951 2018-07-16 16:37:51 Yes that's why now you guys go lick their spit for money and even cook beef receipes there and use oil imported from there..! 
3952 2018-07-16 16:37:35 Oil falls 3%, below $69, as Treasury says importers may get leeway to buy Iranian crude, despite sanctions : "OIL  GREED & CORRUPTION BY THE REPUBLICUNT FINANCIAL & "OIL" CORP "KOCH"-SUKKAS IS OUT OF CONTROL AND UNCONTROLLED !!! IT'S A PHUK'N UTILITY NOT A PHUK'N MONEY RACKET !!
3953 2018-07-16 16:37:28 Fair enough, if they support it with QE and keep Yuan artificially low than you are right. 
I do not think your point on oil is correct though, since oil prices are set w.r.t. global demand, dollar is just the denominator used in the process.
3954 2018-07-16 16:37:24 Can y'all focus on more imp things, did u vote for @weareoneEXO? Streamed their songs? Stop adding oil to fire if u can't even do ur duties as exols #EXO #EXO_COMINGSOON
3955 2018-07-16 16:37:21 i'm getting my oil changed. an employee said, w/o hesitation, "oh, it's going to be a loong wait." i said, "great. i have a lOt of time on my hands." don't mess with a fiery, soon to be 50 year old lithuanian-irish wOman on her period. just d.o.n.'t. 
3956 2018-07-16 16:37:17 I'm scared there's so much fake of this bio oil thing. I don't know where I'll find the original
3957 2018-07-16 16:36:55 I’m not sweating it’s just my coconut and tea tree oil

3962 2018-07-16 16:36:25 No what's horrifying is that our so called friends and allies are robbing us blind with NATO and trade deals, now chooses to go behind our backs & buy gas and oil from our enemies. Hey with friends like these who needs enemies.
3963 2018-07-16 16:36:23 でももし過激派が考えるような不和があったとしたら、杏の立ち回りが出来る女すぎて惚れちゃう
3964 2018-07-16 16:36:21 The Kasakhstan oil pipe cannot feed EU unless Afghanistan's caveman aren't civilized, Russia war began in 12- 1979 thru 2-1989. ~15,000 Soviet soldiers were killed & 35,000 were wounded. ~two million Afghan civilians were killed.

3966 2018-07-16 16:36:13 Because everyone else pays the price for your gasoline emissions and pollution. Besides, oil and gas is more subsidized then renewables and electric vehicles. Let’s get rid of all subsidies and have a level playing field
3967 2018-07-16 16:36:02 SO SCOTLAND HAS HOW MANY ELECTRICITY

3969 2018-07-16 16:35:56 AND, more importantly, he has threatened what Putin loves more than power: money. Trump is attempting to replace Russian oil and gas in Europe with American energy.#MAGA
3970 2018-07-16 16:35:49 Imma second that and that oil was bomb asf
3971 2018-07-16 16:35:44 I did a light Caesar also very good with soy sauce, sesame oil , rice wine vinegar and ginger vinaigrette.
3972 2018-07-16 16:35:39 But it’s ok trump believes him cos putin showed him the pee pee tape again to remind him who’s boss and also reminded him how much he’s making out of the Russian oil Co deal seeing as he has 19% in the company
3973 2018-07-16 16:35:34 Putin and Trump need to not speak of "oil & gas" with heatwaves killing thousands & climate change OUT OF HAND. What is wrong with these two? White Men can't lead, only bully & trash the world. Glad when this is all over.  Everyone's consciousness was raised today a notch. GOOD.
3974 2018-07-16 16:35:21 Power will change hands in Naija!

3978 2018-07-16 16:34:54 Retweeted Snake Oil Demagogue (@SnakeOilPrez):

Helsinki, Finland only reaches 30 degrees Celsius about once every decade. 

It’s 30 degrees Celsius today in Helsinki. 

Global warming? 

Nope. 

Satan and his minions are in town.

3979 2018-07-16 16:34:52 I like going to farmers markets at the end of the day and buying their leftover ugly tomatoes for cheap. And yes, good olive oil matters. Tho I’ve still never achieved what I enjoyed daily in Seville.

3983 2018-07-16 16:34:10 15:36 - Crew from @SpilsbyFire attended reports of a domestic oil tank leaking, crew used specialist sealant paste to reseal the tank.
3984 2018-07-16 16:34:08 But frankly other than that I’m in utter shock, I think I have a few circuits fried and I haven’t processed everything yet. But it did seem like a damn admission of guilt on both sides. It will all get disected. But hey we found out about the Russian oil we bought that’s neat ffs

3986 2018-07-16 16:33:50 This Keto diet shit is disgusting. I saw a guy eating olive oil mixed with chicken broth..... just think about that for a second
3987 2018-07-16 16:33:49 Pharmaceutical companies have way more influence over public policy than oil companies ever have.

They also control the majority of the studies that are published and execs move from positions in and out of the CDC and FDA all the time.

Are you comfortable with that?
3988 2018-07-16 16:33:46 I know a woman who works at Mcdonalds, her husband is an oil tycoon in Dubai. She just works there for something to do, she drives there in a Ferrari
3989 2018-07-16 16:33:46 It always been about the oil. Going to open up the Arctic. Human habitat is going to suffer on a global scale. #KeepItInTheGround
3990 2018-07-16 16:33:44 Demos are out. They are not coming back. Jeb anyone that considered the constitution as a god "dammed" peace of paper should stay away from the capitol. I fought Clinton attorneys in Texas looking for a federal handout. they Destroyed my Oil and Gas company in Dallas for profit
3991 2018-07-16 16:33:42 Wats mor ironic is that it is so hot beyond normal standards because of climate change due in part to mass production of oil, gas, and coal. So ur propaganda is nothing progressive by any means. Every tweet of urs says it all. Freedoms shouldnt matter for oil, coal, & gas profits
3992 2018-07-16 16:33:36 Actually Diprobase was one of the treatments that worked for me the most and for the longest time before it stopped. And you realise that coconut oil works on the same principle; as an emollient? So if coconut oil works then by the same logic so does diprobase.
3993 2018-07-16 16:33:33 My book sleeps with me. It's covered in creases and sticky notes, and several pages are dog eared. It also has tomato olive oil on it but that's Tesco's fault (unopened salad leaked). It lives in me and I live in it. 
3994 2018-07-16 16:33:25 夜公演、輝さんめちゃくちゃ席近い上に度々真正面に立ってとてもやばかったです。輝さんにはわりと目が合ったような気がしても逸らさずにいられる不思議。なんかずっと見たいというか、見れる位置にいるのに見逃したくない、って思うのかもしれない

The games are rigged, the prizes are crap and the whole thing reeks of rancid oil grease and rotting corn dogs.

4005 2018-07-16 16:32:24 Japanese sweet potatoes are amazing. Roasted them in the oven with chili, paprika, and curry powder and they came out delicious. No oil needed.

4027 2018-07-16 16:30:28 Putin owned this statement and press conference. Trump was quite measured, which is very rare. My Russian ETF $RSX has lagged a bit (flat really) with some of the sanctions and oil issues but it's a diversification (foreign) tool & part of the #DragonBear long term view.
4028 2018-07-16 16:30:25 Trump has done more to hamstring Russia--expelling diplomats, supporting domestic oil production, etc--than your empty suit boss ever did.

4034 2018-07-16 16:30:06 Wrong thinking:

Correct thinking:
Zero tolerance for illegal invasion...come in legally if accepted.
Stay in your home country and work to improve it.
Mexico is oil,mineral and agriculturally rich country....no reason for such poverty and crime.
Fix your own country.

4044 2018-07-16 16:29:19 “This will cost oil refinery jobs in Canada, which is where most employment in the oil industry exists.”

That’s incorrect.
4045 2018-07-16 16:29:15 How'd you break it in? Also are you changing oil?

4049 2018-07-16 16:29:06 Honestly no. I always just experiment with portions. You just need your veggies, the seasonings, eggs and rice, quinoa, couscous whatever you prefer and a lil oil to bind it and make a burger. You could add bread crumbs too
4050 2018-07-16 16:29:05 What kind of oil we talkin? x
4051 2018-07-16 16:28:52 This pipeline is being illegally built there has already been a cease and desist by a local judge to the company who is blatantly ignoring the local state government. By this statement of yours you basically said it's ok for oil to destroy as it pleases without consent.

4075 2018-07-16 16:26:56 Trump is succeeding in pushing oil and gas prices down, his steel and aluminum tariffs are making more companies base their factories in the US, making more jobs and lowering unemployment.
4076 2018-07-16 16:26:55 Because they are in on it.. this is the biggest insider trading scam in history. American corporations, Russia’s vast natural resources..

4083 2018-07-16 16:26:23 Moron, oil is an essential resource for the economy.

Further, the statement is following his comment to Germany regarding diversifying their energy supplier; likely relating to FRR who discovered a trillion dollar oil reserve within Georgia.

4133 2018-07-16 16:21:41 1/ Ithink the other important point is there were several core businesses that made money and continued to exist in one form or another. Pipelines to $kmi. Oil and gas exploration $eog. Trading with Centaurus. The capital structure was garbage and hid losses at international

4140 2018-07-16 16:20:37 If I were to guess, it's mainly about oil and getting sanctions lifted to get that Exxon deal through that Rex Tillerson was hired to get done.  That and of course personal financial enrichment for all involved.
4141 2018-07-16 16:20:21 Indian oil chief's threat to OPEC of migrating to alternate energy vehicles has worked i guess...since that day oil prices have nose dived @BJP4India @INCIndia @NITIAayog @EESL_India @timesofindia @IndiaToday @IndianExpress @ndtv @CNNnews18 @TimesNow @nitin_gadkari

4143 2018-07-16 16:20:00 I also dislike all those where there is too much E330 Citric acid. That's also why i only took the ones with Paprika or Sea salt.

But because you now use rape oil instead sunflower oil everywhere and my GF said that rape oil is unhealthy, i now even won't purchase those anymore.
4144 2018-07-16 16:19:50 My cousin sales CBD for a huge company. Bath bombs, ontmemts , candy, oil. All kinds of stuff, and it's completely safe and guaranteed you'll pass a drug test. I use the bathbombs all the time. I can send you the info?
4145 2018-07-16 16:19:36 Trump opened up arms sales to Ukraine. Obama denied. Trump reopened polish missle defense. Trump sanctioned Putin’s son in law. Best friend. And largest oil oligarch. All of which obama would not.
4146 2018-07-16 16:19:26 I Need Cuticle oil So Bad
4147 2018-07-16 16:19:16 I've heard people tell me that oils have improved their mental health (depression and anxiety), cured headaches immediately, improved sleep (by rubbing lavender oil on their feet) and I'm just not convinced.
4148 2018-07-16 16:19:15 Mix olive oil & tea tree oil (one part each) & let sit over night. Make sure you wear a shirt to keep it from getting everywhere. But it will literally draw all the sunburn out overnight

4155 2018-07-16 16:18:41 Russia has been severely affected by low oil prices—a mainstay of the Russian economy—and Western economic sanctions imposed because of Russian meddling in Ukraine and Crimea
4156 2018-07-16 16:18:41 ...nah, Seth...this was no "summit", it was a business prospectus to exploit the commercial value of oil, minerals, and Towers in Russia...just like the RNK's private meeting was about condos, Towers, and beach development on RNK shorelines ...this wasn't for the American people

4163 2018-07-16 16:18:22 Norway’s Oil Fund is projected to triple in size and grow to 3 trillion by 2030 (if all goes well), making the payout per citizen $1,500/mo at 3%. That means a free perpetual income for all its citizens (kinda like /r/fire but on a country level)
4164 2018-07-16 16:18:10 Them little oil pens the devil but convenient as hell.
4165 2018-07-16 16:17:58 A few years after cold war's end & demise of Soviet Union, Putin stole Russia's democracy, much like Trump's trying to do to us. Putin turned Russia into a kleptocracy where the mob prospers, despite a small economy dependent on oil prices--boosted by Trump's policies. MOBSTERS.
4166 2018-07-16 16:17:57 drinking oil does though
4167 2018-07-16 16:17:55 You are not a traitor (as far as I know!), but there was no reason for Trump to actively carry water for a murderous mafia regime which almost always seeks to damage us.
4168 2018-07-16 16:17:45 Most Americans use shitty olive oil and not enough of it.

Takeaways:
4.Trump says Russia/US competitors in oil/gas.
5.Trump trusts US intel, yet, comments Putin denies strongly. Points out Putin will allow us to question the 12.
6. Trump says this is just the beginning.
7.Trump discusses Syrian humanitarian effort.
4173 2018-07-16 16:17:29 First is the oil squeezed out, the second is distilled, so super duper concentrated.

Pray for me in this time of need.
4178 2018-07-16 16:17:06 A deal in the making: Trump just traded American democracy for prospect of oil and gas deals with Putin. #HelsinkiSummit #Oil #LNG
4179 2018-07-16 16:16:58 .@KHarmDD59. Thanks Kat! But they are routing for you to import oil from a power!
4180 2018-07-16 16:16:52 But yes, Scotland following the rational route of 150 other countries since 1945 and becoming a normal independent country would be *worse* than this. Because reasons. Like oil. #StopBrexit #IndependenceIsNormal

4182 2018-07-16 16:16:50 OPEC crude oil production rose by 173kbpd in June to 32.3mbpd, led by Saudi Arabia, Iraq, UAE, Kuwait and Nigeria, production declines were seen in Libya and Venezuela. 

But the 2018 oil demand growth forecast is unchanged at 1.65mbpd.
4183 2018-07-16 16:16:47 remember that “oil free” skin products suck. 

you need the RIGHT kind of oil: low molecular weight, fragrance-free, antimicrobial (carrier, NOT essential) oil.
4184 2018-07-16 16:16:40 They were huge in the 70s in the UK. But then again so were massive flared trousers, sideburns and the oil crisis so...
4185 2018-07-16 16:16:22 There it is. Putin obviously didn't let Trump off the hook.  Still owes him and probably others (oil men?). This is treasonous behavior.

4187 2018-07-16 16:16:17 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
4188 2018-07-16 16:16:15 i’m getting my oil changed and some lady in here watching it. i’m so annoyed i’m bout to walk outside.
4189 2018-07-16 16:16:10 I bet you've has plenty of volunteers both male and female to rub oil in to that body 
4190 2018-07-16 16:16:10 Bumper stickers are clear and unambiguous, unlike this young lady.
4191 2018-07-16 16:16:06 6 foreign govts have contributed MORE than $5m to the CF.  One them being Germany .. who just got called out for paying Russia BILLIONS of dollars for oil.

.. that's just what came to mind.
4192 2018-07-16 16:16:04 @andersoncooper Did you miss the part of Putin’s response to the question of the Crimea pipeline, in which he stated that he and Trump agreed that it was in the interest of both countries to work together to maintain the profitability of gas and oil. Price collusion!
4193 2018-07-16 16:15:49 Historically we raised 17billion & 10%, but after adjusting for inflation/gathering it could now be 20billion. So allowing for budget cuts far all wastage + redundant or excessive Gov’t spend, we need to know how the gap against GST will be covered. Oil is temp. safety net. 1
4194 2018-07-16 16:15:46 Quite frankly they would then complain about our usage of air, water, food, oil, mineral elements et al and then like the US stones, call for depopulation.

4202 2018-07-16 16:15:11 Hey Siri ,,, how far can I drive before I REALLY need an oil change
4203 2018-07-16 16:15:09 What is the exact amount?
Is it the same in every town, city, state? 
It would seem beyond the ability of the fed gov to establish a wage that is applicable everywhere even if we wanted to

4212 2018-07-16 16:14:30 Il est aussi bon de noter que la séparation entre pays de langues d'oc et de langues d'oil recoupait aussi peu ou prou la séparation entre les pays de droit romain (ce qu'il en restait en tout les cas) et ceux de droit coutumier.

4221 2018-07-16 16:14:07 The attacks on the constitution are coming from the President.  Sounds like you have been sucked in by his propaganda.  I will stand with America and the intelligence community that risks their lives on the daily over a snake oil salesmen’s claim based only on his words.
4222 2018-07-16 16:14:04 Today BJP Yuva Morcha vandals attacked my constituency office in Thiruvananthapuram. They poured black engine oil on signs, doors, walls & gate, drove away innocent citizens waiting with their petitions, put up offensive banners & shout ed slogans asking me to go to Pakistan.
4223 2018-07-16 16:14:01 Tough day on market. Down almost 2% across all sectors. Rand stronger   and did not help resources or rand hedges. Actual commodity prices also down platinum approaching 800 and palladium 900. Oil down to 72. Amplats trading update good. Cashbuild again flat sales
4224 2018-07-16 16:13:55 Here you go again popping off at the mouth before hearing the whole thing as usual. How do you suppose we do any more than we are with all of Europe funding Russia by buying their gas and oil?

4241 2018-07-16 16:12:47 Evidently you never listened in the first place. My hours and wages had been cut, but throughout most of the downturn my rig was busy doing abandonments. I took time off to come to Ottawa. Never smeared my face, those covies were covered in so much frac oil it was unavoidable.
4242 2018-07-16 16:12:43 Omg same I just went on a cruise and my waiter specifically gave me a bottle of olive oil next to my bread bc I loved it sm hahaha
4243 2018-07-16 16:12:43 Forget crude oil and gas, @iam_Davido and  @wizkidayo are the biggest export from Nigeria

4246 2018-07-16 16:12:29 Another monster drop in oil, as I alerted would happen. Always remember, charts are the only unbiased thing out there. If you follow the charts, your success rate will be at its highest. Tons of doubters giving me bs reasons why oil was going higher...then 10% collapse.

4252 2018-07-16 16:12:00 OLIVE OIL YESH
4253 2018-07-16 16:11:49 I never do, but I suppose you could. I just toss them with a bit of olive oil and sea salt. Or ras al hanout, when I want to get fancy.
4254 2018-07-16 16:11:47 How about this? Putin/Trump undermined UK EU ref; Both want Brexit. Why? EU Domino effect! Then Putin & Trump carve up world between themselves: "One oil space for me, and one oil space for you...!" UK is turning into a one party Fascist state unless UK gets rid of this govt.
4255 2018-07-16 16:11:40 If you get your oil changed at Walmart, and your Walmart has a nail salon in it, then it kinda exists!
4256 2018-07-16 16:11:40 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
4257 2018-07-16 16:11:40 I don't parboil them: they go soft pretty quickly without that. A bit of oil, salt and grain mustard goes nicely with them...

4262 2018-07-16 16:10:46 Nope! Cut them into finger width wedges (If they're big) or into bitesize chunks if not too big. In a dish, a little seasoning, a little oil, some garlic cloves and some onion quarters. 40 minutes or so at 180 in a fan oven. Kablammo

4266 2018-07-16 16:10:36 Remember not too long ago Congress goons barging into the office of a young honest IAS officer (Keshvendra Kumar, though not sure) and pouring oil over him n manhandling him for his IMPLEMENTING A DECISION made by THEN CONGRESS Govt! Glad that outrage then was vehement as is now!

4270 2018-07-16 16:10:22 1. Castor Oil, Olive Oil or Vaseline 

-Apply castor,olive or Vaseline to your lashes before going to bed, leave it on overnight , then rinse it off with lukewarm water in the morning.
-Repeat for few months.
4271 2018-07-16 16:10:20 I can cook, can perform basic maintenance on cars (oil, brakes, etc), and I'm funny sometimes.
4272 2018-07-16 16:10:17 No, I live in reality, the one your generation screwed up for us. Your generation should've booted oil to the curb decades ago, and since you didn't, now my generation needs to dela with the consequences. Step aside, you've done enough.
4273 2018-07-16 16:10:17 Seems more like an oil painting 
4274 2018-07-16 16:10:07 サラダ油は野菜って言ったら変な顔されたよ。サラダってついてるのに本当に馬鹿だなあ。
4275 2018-07-16 16:10:02 those snake-oil-turned-fish-oil salesmen really pulled it off
4276 2018-07-16 16:10:00 But don’t they have oil?
4277 2018-07-16 16:09:57 I'm calling it enlightenment funny but  he recommended oil for treating prob more worried about job/reputation than treatment and so worried about side effects !

4287 2018-07-16 16:08:42 OMFG~ Root word of Conservative is "con". Love it how you have to resort to whataboutisms when you aren't winning on the issues. Typical.  So continue to indulge in that snake oil with the rest of your Cult 45~!
4288 2018-07-16 16:08:38 Dulu umi ayah nak sangat anak dia ni jadi doktor and now skrg tahu anak dia ni boleh masuk oil & gas industry terus sokong course ape yg aku ambik skrg. I think we need to guide our parents expectation, yelah mostly semua parents kata doktor ni everything. But we are who we are.
4289 2018-07-16 16:08:24 2. Shower 

EVERY TIME! Showering right after exercising can help remove sweat and oil that accumulate on the surface of the skin. Sitting in your wet workout clothes can increase your risk of developing buttne. Stick to gentle cleaners e.g. Dove sensitive skin beauty bar 
4290 2018-07-16 16:08:23 じゃあ肉いっぱい食べて腹を出せ～～
4291 2018-07-16 16:08:17 This is all about oil. Tillerson bought a trillion dollars worth of oil leases from Putin. The oil split between Trump, Exxon Mobil and Putin. They need drilling implements that were in the sanctions.
4292 2018-07-16 16:08:11 I am glad, though, that all of you traitors, treason-adjacent enablers, frauds, puppets, and snake oil salesman are on record with all of this nonsense. It will make the reckoning that is to come that much easier.
4293 2018-07-16 16:08:08 Hard to say it industry turns on him.  Oil is capped under him though. Upside skew gone for now.

4296 2018-07-16 16:07:54 Next up ...Trump makes friends with ISIS. He feels that they were misunderstood. Trump pushes the ...women should all be subservient and wear face covering. Trump says ISIS has oil and we need to do business with them
4297 2018-07-16 16:07:51 Water wars will make oil wars look like minor skirmishes

4302 2018-07-16 16:07:10 Does that now mean the monosodium glutamate wasn't declared before then? Because i always checked and there was no E621 or monosodium glutamate on those package i usually took.

But the new ones with the rape oil now have monosodium glutamate, even the ones with only paprika..
4303 2018-07-16 16:07:06 *finishes a bowl of braised rice(anguamo)*

4305 2018-07-16 16:06:56 Can’t you now pay for private police ? 
This is the way it’s going, & btw, what’s happening with the Notting Hill Police Station. 
Is it still being sold to the oil rich ppl or have we had a reprieve bc actually, POLICE ARE IMPORTANT
4306 2018-07-16 16:06:50 When you go to get your oil changed and forget to turn off your Bluetooth so the mechanics are listening to lil uzi while working on it
4307 2018-07-16 16:06:41 Big rich gas conglomerates are people, too! (according to Citizens United).  Who will stick up for them?  Other than Congress, both parties, the MSM, plutocrats, and a few other struggling entities? How dare you deprive some oil executive of their right to a third vacation home!!
4308 2018-07-16 16:06:38 Yeah. #Trump deftly avoided directly criticising oil delivery like his ream-job to Merkel last week. Diplomacy won the day today.
4309 2018-07-16 16:06:35 @realDonaldTrump.I am a oil producer I'm a follower and a supporter of you, Why are you trying to keep oil prices down which hurts the American Producers their employees and families? oil was $130+ gas was $4, people were able to live their lives then why not now? #newrefinery
4310 2018-07-16 16:06:34 Equities ticking down
US 10Y Yield up 3bps
Oil down 3%
DXY flat
4311 2018-07-16 16:06:33 Look there’s no better yam delicacy than with palm oil. You can’t even tell me nothing
4312 2018-07-16 16:06:33 And exposed Turkey for buying ISIS OIL. While Turkey was flooding the market with cheap Syrian Oil, the oil price dropped by about $100 a barrel. Coincidence? How far does the rabbit hole go?
4313 2018-07-16 16:06:17 I wonder, if i started selling snake oil pills how many gullible Americans would buy it if i said it had great health benefits.
4314 2018-07-16 16:06:17 تقصدين اللي اسمه rosehip oil؟
4315 2018-07-16 16:06:07 Literally toggling between Amazon and Walmart to see who is going to be cheaper on the 5 quarts of oil at 3PM... last year Amazon was $17 for 5 quarts #Bang #ItsARace
4316 2018-07-16 16:06:06 Of course not.  He has alienated all our allies.  Does he realize they probably won't support us in these sanctions,  or was that the plan all along? Some experts say there is like 6 trillion dollars worth of oil in Russia.   All they need is sanctions lifted. Trump likes money
4317 2018-07-16 16:06:03 Literally toggling between Amazon and Walmart to see who is going to be cheaper on the 5 quarts of oil at 3PM... last year Amazon was $17 for 5 quarts #Bang #ItsARace

4319 2018-07-16 16:05:58 what a beautiful morning it is. blessed to have another day being booked and busy. 

Agave Oil & Skincare photoshoot today, you’re looking at the new face of their ads and campaign 
4320 2018-07-16 16:05:33 おやすみ〜
4321 2018-07-16 16:05:14 Yeah by borrowing the hydroelectric power of Quebec while pumping dirtier-than-tar-sands oil within it's own suburbs... How can any system that allows CA to do that be considered "progress" on #climatechange? 

It's a sham, as was Ontario's participation in it.
4322 2018-07-16 16:05:03 We won't. The reality is that Russia is in a very vulnerable position as a petrostate. They cannot survive without western trade and relatively high oil prices.

They are only a big issue because the have a lot of nukes and are very willing to use these shady tricks (hacking)
4323 2018-07-16 16:05:01 Yeah, for extra yummy ness, or a drop of olive oil if you’re dieting. It’s a great go-to dish. Use up veggies if you’ve any just gone a bit floppy. Also cook down a drop of vermouth or white wine if you have any left to boost the flavour. Enjoy!
4324 2018-07-16 16:04:56 Let me translate this whole summit for you: I @POTUS want to build Hotels in RU and get money from everything I can, oil and so on to pay off all my loans. Please bend over PUTIN, and mark the spot, thanks!
4325 2018-07-16 16:04:53 i put castor oil on my lashes and brows last night and i feel like Pro Beauty Guru rn even though i give -10 shits about my face hhh
4326 2018-07-16 16:04:50 確かにラフムである
4327 2018-07-16 16:04:43 @RevlonSA I would appreciate a full kit of the new Black Seed Oil range to testdrive on my afro.
4328 2018-07-16 16:04:42 No snake oil for sale here... Yeah, totally two honest admirable men being totally honest & admirable to their citizens. We've officially entered The Twilight Zone... 
4329 2018-07-16 16:04:41 Thanks -- I didn't go to the doctor. (Urgentcare is $100, plus I read -- in pain! -- about the various drugs and realized I was probably not going to lose an eye and that I would have benefits w/o side-effects from using coconut oil, liquefied.)
4330 2018-07-16 16:04:20 Your diet is also a factor. This ad is for snake oil. Ignore it.
4331 2018-07-16 16:04:20 avoid razor bumps & ingrown hair on all parts of your body by using diluted tea tree oil 
4332 2018-07-16 16:04:11 There’s nothing fast about an oil change at Fast Eddy’s 
4333 2018-07-16 16:04:05 Standard Oil Company corporate entity continues in existence and was the operating entity for Sohio; it is now a subsidiary of BP
4334 2018-07-16 16:04:03 Tip of the day: Order your fuel oil when you're at about 1/4 of a tank. This gives us enough time to schedule your delivery without you having to fear a no-fuel emergency. #TheOilClub
4335 2018-07-16 16:04:03 I love the finished product when I put tea tree oil on my wig & straighten it out .. shit be so silky 
4336 2018-07-16 16:03:54 I went into a appointment and instead of taking my pen out of my pocket I pulled out my oil pen in front of a client
4337 2018-07-16 16:03:49 Russia totally reliant on Oil & other commodities 

Germany/ nato attack last week - supporting  Russian economy 
Higher prices allow more arms expenditure 

Trump - does he ask Saudi to pump more ( hurt Russia)
or avoid
reduce his own trade balance as well as cop out lower oil?
4338 2018-07-16 16:03:45 Do you understand the term ‘eczema’ covers a range of skin conditions? Can you please explain how my contact dermatitis as anything to my gut? And how would putting coconut oil directly into the affected skin cure anything in the gut?
4339 2018-07-16 16:03:42 For any of you who still think I have my shit together, this morning I superglued my fingers together and now my hands smell offensively of tea tree oil. I also tried taking a bite out of my wallet and stuffing a pop tart into my back pocket
4340 2018-07-16 16:03:32 1/ Free mln $ idea:
- create service that runs car errands for you
  (Think GrubHub/Uber/Postmates to get on oil change, new tires, gas, etc.)
- use #blockchain smart contract to make single use encrypted private key allowing vetted stranger access to vehicle

4350 2018-07-16 16:02:02 The more we focus on tapes and the less we focus on oil and world domination and the fact our President has children in cages and is committing Treason in broad day light, we have our focus - out of focus. Might get "likes" but it's time to do what's right.

Stands to reason if Americans can't survive on the wages without help, neither can illegal aliens.
4357 2018-07-16 16:01:23 You dont take it with anything?  Just pure olive oil?
4358 2018-07-16 16:01:23 I had to turn off the tv. My blood pressure... I’m. screaming at tv sooo loud and at an unknown decibel to my dog; he ran down to the basement and hiding under oil tank!! What the God almighty FUCK!

4366 2018-07-16 16:00:35 The rand has been strongly lately, fuel hikes are caused by Brent crude oil it has been rising since last year

4377 2018-07-16 15:59:57 Second time I’ve forgotten to put my oil cap back on after checking my oil

4380 2018-07-16 15:59:42 That's what I want to know as well, they glossed over sanctions, but when they talked about oil, they would have to lift the sanctions.
4381 2018-07-16 15:59:41 Getting my car inspected and oil changed. Stream will be later this afternoon, my internet looked like it was better so 
4382 2018-07-16 15:59:28 @saladworks I can’t find another way to contact you on your website. I used your gipsee app to look for allergens and identified soy as an allergen, yet nearly every single salad dressing that was recommended to me contains soybean oil.
4383 2018-07-16 15:59:14 Other notable Standard Oil principals include Henry Flagler,
4384 2018-07-16 15:59:09 kannnnnn. tak kisah putih, nak clear skin je. #roadtoglassskin kemain glass lagi. hahahaha oil cleanser kau pakai apa wehh
4385 2018-07-16 15:58:57 Ending on the 'witch hunt' note.  I fucking hate this government.  The money grubbing pricks in the Republican party, the Koch Brothers, who are counting on the oil in Russia via Exxon.  It's all playing out, Mitch McConnell needs to get the fuck out
4386 2018-07-16 15:58:49 Trump’s anger causes him to end the news conference! Great questions from the press including some questions from the Russian Press. One about oil..
4387 2018-07-16 15:58:41 すみりんちん字が綺麗
4388 2018-07-16 15:58:40 not to sound like a hippie or anything but my essential oil diffuser and my himalayan salt lamp are hands down the best purchases i've ever made.
4389 2018-07-16 15:58:37 Unless, of course, you're a shill for the oil companies. Then I guess that would be bad. Who likes breathing clean air and drinking clean water anyway?
4390 2018-07-16 15:58:36 Yeah just grate it/ slice it , maybe a bit of olive oil & lemon juice & salt?
4391 2018-07-16 15:58:34 anyone understand why butter (vs olive oil) makes for a better non-stick cooking situation frying eggs in a cast iron pan?
4392 2018-07-16 15:58:28 Klo pake baby oil tetep gausah di usap kapas kah?
4393 2018-07-16 15:58:20 As an American, we're fucked. But, Russia has opened up its oil market. Win-win, right?
4394 2018-07-16 15:58:14 You know it’s gonna be a great day when you spill face oil on you light grey shirt and have already left the house and can’t change
4395 2018-07-16 15:58:09 Putin wants Washington to send details on the 12 indicted Russian intel officers...part of a criminal treaty between two countries. Putin also wants US to do same for guys them deem of interest, and my guess is that that includes expat hedge fund managers and oil men.

4399 2018-07-16 15:57:06 You can’t just focus on economy, what about gas/oil pipes feeding into Europe, staggering volume of nukes? That brings them to every table, they absolutely are a major power.
4400 2018-07-16 15:57:04 So now we know more about what Putin wants.  Oil.  Does anyone else see them teaming up against OPEC here?  They are setting the stage for something. War in ME always makes oil prices soar. #TreasonSummit
4401 2018-07-16 15:57:00 This has nothing to do with $ exhange rate or even oil prices. This is just another gross tax imposed by government to fuel the gravy train! Neighboring countries buy from same suppliers and do not have these fluctuating fuel prices!
4402 2018-07-16 15:56:53 We can't stop TREASON, you think we have a prayer with a SCJ or stopping election Tampering?   He's just been in a private 2 hour meeting with a man who puts on FAKE elections  and WINS EVERY-TIME in Russia?   HOW DUMB are WE?  This is OIL and World Domination not a joke.

4405 2018-07-16 15:56:28 Oil uses electricity to refine, so no perfect solution. My van was charging off my solar panels on Sunday, I’m not sure you can get more greener than this?

4407 2018-07-16 15:56:24 @RoyaleUSA - I've only had your vapor styling iron (argan oil) for a year and already the unit that makes the steam has completely fallen apart. Can I get another one, and if so how do I go about doing that...?

4408 2018-07-16 15:56:16 @maddow I've asked several times, but think NOW it's important for you to re-visit the oil field interests of Trump and Exxon.  That broadcast was clear warning of the 'why'/  Please look at it again.  The killer is lying right to the press.  Any bad press will be considered fake

4413 2018-07-16 15:55:29 Most #oil history suggests that neither US nor former USSR has great form in “regulating” international energy markets. In fact, quite the contrary. The Majors were another story.

4416 2018-07-16 15:55:03 Well, if you're convinced that oligarchic government is superior to democracy like Trump and the oil companies, hedge fund managers, arms dealers and casino bosses who prop up his regime, it is America's fault for defending itself from totalatarianism.
4417 2018-07-16 15:55:03 I bet there are at least a 100 ways to produce energy without using oil...hemp would be good for the environment, absorbs pollutants from the soil to detox it, it doesn't require pesticides or fertilizer.....

My goodness, I'm so sorry you're dealing with all of that now.
Ugh. I'm so very sorry.
I'm a spine person too, and I'd not wish this on anyone.
Jeepers, Chris; have you tried CBD oil? It's the ONLY way I can actually get out of bed most days.
4439 2018-07-16 15:52:44 Trump nodded in agreement as Putin proposed energy price fixing to keep oil prices high. claimed it would be good for consumers. Welcome back to the Bush era price fixing. with $4.50-$6.50/gallon gas. now an explicit government policy.

4444 2018-07-16 15:52:30 News that the Syrian Democratic Forces handed oil fields over to the Syrian Arab Army are wrong
4445 2018-07-16 15:52:18 That presupposes he knew that Trump would sign up for the undercoat + clearcoat. It was signaled overtly by 2016 Trump campaign. See GOP convo platform, slips on NATO, Ukraine, Turkey, Syria. The only contentious mention today so far: Iran. But higher oil prices are Russian adv.

4452 2018-07-16 15:52:07 Use a gentle face wash like cetaphil twice a day and a moisturizer with a high spf to prevent sunburns and early aging of the skin. Exfoliate with a brush or scrub 1-3 times a week depending on your skin. Tea tree oil is great for spot treating breakouts.

4466 2018-07-16 15:50:50 What is laughable is Roberts says Koch is motivated by a desire to make it a better world for others, when every action by the Kochs has been out of the most narrow of self interest, all the way down to building a pipeline across the US from Canada to export oil for higher prices
4467 2018-07-16 15:50:37 We have hundreds if not thousands of military bases across the world. We must all ask ourselves why?

4477 2018-07-16 15:49:30 Interesting. Friends on the right are raging that he's not doing enough to support the oil industry, while friends on the left are riled over the purchase of that oil pipeline. With both sides entrenched in their positions, sounds like he found the right balance for our country.

4483 2018-07-16 15:49:10 Keep your eye on the ball: the Republican Donor Class propping up Trump: they, like Putin, reject democracy and share the same need for fossil fuel dependency.  Oil companies, coal companies and the refineries all benefit from high oil prices and actively work to stop renewables.

4501 2018-07-16 15:47:11 In April 2005, the United States oil company Chevron made an offer to acquire Unocal, which was followed by a competing bid
4502 2018-07-16 15:47:10 Still requires regulation, because when demand drops, companies lobby Congress to find ways to make up the profit.  E.g. destroying US solar sector businesses so oil will get more.
4503 2018-07-16 15:47:07 also why do you feel the need to keep reminding us that there are a ton of ducks / marine life that are cover in oil anyways @DawnDish ??

4505 2018-07-16 15:46:43 Vladmir Putin was the head of intelligence during the coup that unseated Gorbachev.  He has been positioning the rise of a new Soviet empire ever since.  He found a dupe in Trump.  He still has not released his returns.  We don't know his interests in oil, gas & transportation.

4507 2018-07-16 15:46:17 FWIW, fish oil (n-3) supplements have been used for a long time. 

Even grain-fed beef has a ~6:1 n-6/n-3 ratio, which's still better than something like avocados.

When I cook meat, I bake/grill it to remove some of the fat and then add a fat like grass-fed butter to raise n-3.
4508 2018-07-16 15:46:16 it wasn't a meeting it was an Putin lead Intel debrief. Putin asks questions and @realDonaldTrump answers. Putin is controlling the subjects and answers to the reporters. @realDonaldTrump is answering the way the Putin wants him to the reporters.

It's better fresh though, the store-bought is not as good.
4514 2018-07-16 15:45:49 That's why it's been branded as Canola oil, as opposed to rapeseed oil.

4521 2018-07-16 15:45:20 The American press are embarrassing. The international press at least asking intelligent questions about oil trade etc. It's embarrassing for the POTUS to have to defend himself against these U.S. journalists about collusion.

4529 2018-07-16 15:44:33 Why does trump keep sucking up to Putin? Is it about the oil, the coal or building hotels? Or is it the peeper tapes?

Warped to be deathly pessimistic to illicit more funding for NGO

Warped to be unrealistically upbeat to entice big business monopolies (e.g. UK oil drilling conglomerates)

4621 2018-07-16 15:38:42 Watch for my column today about carbon pricing in the USA and internationally with Prof. Victor Flatt of the UofHouston. Even under Trump carbon pricing is much more prevelant than CDNs think, inc. federal legislation that requires assessing ghg emissions on oil/gas projects.
4622 2018-07-16 15:38:29 I'm no genius.
However, what I just heard from Putin is the suggestion that the US and Russia team up for oil/gas production.

This means they would make OPEC a thing of the past. 

Consistent production and prices v OPEC being used as a political weapon.

4639 2018-07-16 15:37:25 So you pull out of the Iran deal which boosts oil prices, benefit to Russia. Then you have a meeting and sell the idea that you can bring down the gas prices you have inflated. Watch the vilification of OPEC in the US as he tries to sell this garbage.

4665 2018-07-16 15:35:59 How interesting it is to hear Putin talking about how Russia needs the oil and gas business to be “profitable”! I can recall when this concept was TABOO im the Soviet Union!
4666 2018-07-16 15:35:58 Absolutely! Sautéed with garlic and oil, they’re like fuzzy broccoli rabe

4673 2018-07-16 15:35:38 I’m running around getting ready with the putin/trump presser in the background but: was the first question about how great it would be if the US bought Russian oil? And was Putin’s answer to the second question a proposal on how he will expand *Ukraine’s* infrastructure?
4674 2018-07-16 15:35:38 Of course he is......because Russia and Iran are allies. Russia supplies military technology in exchange for oil and energy.
4675 2018-07-16 15:35:38 We just heard the crux of the Trump-Putin alliance; corner the oil and gas market worldwide. Thanks, petroleum lobby. #Pressconference
4676 2018-07-16 15:35:38 Oops... Shell gas is produced from Russian oil? Where does Sunoco and Chevron originate? Just curious 
4677 2018-07-16 15:35:37 “gotta love easter when they throw holy oil at you like chicken nuggets”
4678 2018-07-16 15:35:36 Someone said that God put coal and oil in the earth 4 man to find. Well ,he also gave us wind,and solar Man, not God makes the choice what to do !!!!!!!!!
4679 2018-07-16 15:35:35 Q: Topic Russia + US being major oil & gas powers, plummeting prices and consumers suffering (NOTE: when did Russia ever care about customers' suffering?) Russia stands ready to maintain this transit (ie NS2) Per my intvu this AM it's Russia v the US competing for global energy

4683 2018-07-16 15:35:21 Did #Putin just said the him and #Trump talked about controlling international oil prices? The new #OPEC?
4684 2018-07-16 15:35:18 Trump and Putin got to the root of the matter.  Its about OIL and GAS.  @PurgaToriDk @EdKrassen
4685 2018-07-16 15:35:17 Sidestepped first question about oil and gas and Germany. Didn’t know enough to answer.
4686 2018-07-16 15:35:14 And here comes the threat...if you don't let us do this, gas prices will rise.  If you let us do this, cheap oil.  Always the oil, always the fossil fuels.  Always the stupidity of global destruction.  If that's not treason I don't know what is.
4687 2018-07-16 15:35:09 @MSNBC So now we'll have an oil and gas duopoly between the U.S. and Russia.
4688 2018-07-16 15:35:09 Telling that this "reporter's" exegesis concerns cold winters, oil and gas business. Among other things, an overt US-Russia axis on  production would be huge setback for global efforts to end use climate-heating fossil fuels.
4689 2018-07-16 15:35:00 This is all about oil .. have you looked at the bots' tweets …  denying climate change, pushing oil .. Trump has a piece of a 5 trillion dollar Artic Oil payoff waiting for him as soon as he lifts sanctions. So do many in the GOP ..  speculating?  Maybe.   Truth?  No doubt.
4690 2018-07-16 15:34:58 Shell gas. hmm where have I heard that? oh yeah, a little country called Viet Nam 1960. Oil reserves. Follow the Money #TreasonSummit
4691 2018-07-16 15:34:58 Something's wrong. This is all about Russia selling oil.  It is their biggest export. So now know why Putin is there. Why are we there?
4692 2018-07-16 15:34:58 Super tasty: My sister's evening pan.  Ingredients: beet, oil, beef broth, evaporated milk, thinly sliced onion, sugar, kielbasa, coca-cola, green pea, and flour.
4693 2018-07-16 15:34:54 I think it sounds like he's lifting sanctions, specifically on the oil.
4694 2018-07-16 15:34:51 Trump is selling America down the river for what?
—Trump Tower Moscow? 4 more yrs?Ivanka 2024? Benefit global oil & gas/LNG
—Likely all of the above resulting in...

Global hegemony of wealthy elites?

#TrumpPutinSummit #TreasonSummit
4695 2018-07-16 15:34:49 Putin and Trump are now talking about oil and gas and how they want to keep prices low, so now we know they want to drive up prices.

A first small look into their mobster-bargain against We The People.

4699 2018-07-16 15:34:41 CCP cash is nice. But US policy to drive up global oil price vs China directly earns more cash for Putin. Probably demanded at Helsinki today.

With Syria secured, W. Europe's still safely dependent on RU gas. GCC gas threat is over. Putin keeps control of EU, winter will come

4709 2018-07-16 15:34:22 Did Putin just say that he and Trump are interesting in working together to regulate oil and energy prices to keep prices UP?  Wow.

4715 2018-07-16 15:34:15 There it is .... 'oil and gas powers'
4716 2018-07-16 15:34:13 Putin says US and Russia could cooperate on regulating oil and gas market. About Nord Stream2, Putin says Russia stands ready to extend contract to transit through Ukraine.

4718 2018-07-16 15:34:08 Just walked in turned the TV for the Trump Putin show talking about =OIL and GAS  =PIPELINES =WTH is the Climate Change situation being addressed ?
4719 2018-07-16 15:34:07 Russia wasn’t our number one enemy in 2012.  Russia was boxed in by sanctions and wracked by a collapsing economy, thanks in part to plummeting oil prices.  Why do you think they gave the election to Donald?  Ease sanctions & raise oil prices..... and he’s doing that.
4720 2018-07-16 15:34:06 Putin making a case for keeping oil prices supported, referencing shale breakeven costs. #OOTT (then quickly adds that prices shouldn’t go too high)

4730 2018-07-16 15:33:58 Now they will work together on oil and gas production. That means I imagine that he trump will recognize Crimea at Russia.

4741 2018-07-16 15:33:46 Oh good grief, very long question, Trump waffles an answer.  Basically attacked Merkel on NATO spending and gas deal with Russia, to somehow guilt her into buying US gas and oil. What a pillock he is.  #TrumpPutinMeeting
4742 2018-07-16 15:33:46 Putin suggesting the US and Russia should artificially keep oil and gas prices high. Trump himself called for lowering the oil price a couple of weeks ago.
4743 2018-07-16 15:33:45 Competitor to the US? The viable commodity for Russia is oil and gas, that is all. They make nothing useful to the United State: CARS, COMPUTERS, TECHNOLOGY, WHAT? They are not an economic power equal to the United States let alone to Italy. Trump is full of BS.
4744 2018-07-16 15:33:44 facilitating oil quid pro quo is what got him in Putin's good graces to begin with.
4745 2018-07-16 15:33:42 @SRuhle Competing on oil and gas has always driven gas prices down...not up! Controlling  it drives prices up! Complete lie!
4746 2018-07-16 15:33:41 So Putin already colluded in the election. Now he wants to collude on the price of oil because it is good for the economy? 
4747 2018-07-16 15:33:41 Will Trump get rid of Russian sanctions?  Will he and wealthy Somars make money off of oil dealings? #TrumpPutinSummit
4748 2018-07-16 15:33:38 @realDonaldTrump What is he talking about in regards to oil? He doesn’t seem to know. Embarrassing. Putin seems to make more sense.
4749 2018-07-16 15:33:37 Oil and gas. There it is. $$$$ #TreasonSummit
4750 2018-07-16 15:33:36 @MSNBC Putin speaks about regulation of gas/oil markets.  Apparently rigging markets does not translate well.
4751 2018-07-16 15:33:35 First question to Trump, first lie uttered. Holy fuck, he even has to one-up his boss when he says the US is the biggest producer of oil and gas.
4752 2018-07-16 15:33:34 Looks like Putin “corrected” Trump’s view on Germany and Russia’s oil pipeline.
4753 2018-07-16 15:33:34 Putin/Trump represents staunch resistance to the waning of the oil paradigm. #TreasonSummit
4754 2018-07-16 15:33:34 Did Putin just say that HE and America should work together to regulate the worlds oil and gas market? Wtf. Republicans?!
4755 2018-07-16 15:33:33 Theoretically, US should hold all the cards in any relationship with Russia. They are weak economically — the people that is. Due to high oil prices, Putin himself, the oligarchs and the government are wealthy. Plan of attack #1 is refuce oil price. The US and Saudi can do this.
4756 2018-07-16 15:33:30 Trump: We're #1 in the oil business.

Putin: No, we're #1 in the oil business.
4757 2018-07-16 15:33:29 Oil pipeline is first Q. from Russian journo. Trump says Russia and U.S. compete... Putin says U.S. & Russia can work together on the regulation of energy/gas...says Russia is not interested in driving prices up. ...Says he reassured energy transit contract thru Ukraine.
4758 2018-07-16 15:33:29 La radicalización de un discurso tiene el poder de radicalizar toda la discusión. Conforme la izquierda invada la vida pública y toque a las puertas de la vida privada, la opisición se tornará más y más de derecha.

4760 2018-07-16 15:33:26 Chuck, are we an oil and gas superpower? Im confused
4761 2018-07-16 15:33:24 PUTIN:  We as a major oil and gas power can work together for regulation of international gas market. We are not interested in driving prices up as it drives all prices up. I reassured we would maintain the security of transit throught the Ukraine.
4762 2018-07-16 15:33:23 There it is! Oil and gas business.  #TreasonSummit
4763 2018-07-16 15:33:21 The oil didn't "leak and touch a wire"; blades were unable to feather (rotate leading edge into wind so no torque is generated) due to mechanical issues in a storm. Brake mechanism then overheated as it couldn't overcome torque & other overspeed failures followed. A unique event.
4764 2018-07-16 15:33:21 The GOV And the AA are both in on it ;-) Oil could drop to $30 and there would still be an increase. Perhaps going nuclear wasn't such a bad idea after all 
4765 2018-07-16 15:33:20 Oh hey, a new international market for oil and gas, protected and maintained by Russia and USA...

Fun.....

Fucking trump handing the world to Putin

4767 2018-07-16 15:33:15 Putin again lies about truth within the DOJ indictments about his involvement in attacking 2016 election. He calls for forming a committee on cyber coordination between US & Russia. Putin said he repeatedly reminded Trump about his thoughts on how to proceed.Aha- now onto the OIL
4768 2018-07-16 15:33:15 If we're number 1 in the world in oil production, why the fuck are we being extorted at over $2 a gallon at the pump?
4769 2018-07-16 15:33:14 watching the body language Joe... Trump is holding his own even after the closed door session. Im still betting on Trump. We export oil and gas Russia loses the cost issue.

4783 2018-07-16 15:32:56 Amazing. #Putin seizes the moment on Nord Stream 2 shows what a gift. "We are aware of the stance of President Trump & I think we as a major oil and gas power, & the United States as an oil and gas power, we could work together on the regulation of oil and gas markets." No doubt.
4784 2018-07-16 15:32:55 Russia and US will set price controls on oil and gas. Sounds super!
4785 2018-07-16 15:32:55 Told ya trump would mention the OIL!

4789 2018-07-16 15:32:46 Trump just said the US is "the largest in the oil and gas world" at a meeting with the Russian president.
4790 2018-07-16 15:32:45 Russian journalist "US had to buy Russian gas for Boston .... You called Putin an adversary, a rival, ..." 
"Actually I called him a competitor and a good competitor he is, that is a compliment. we will be competing for the pipeline. The US is largest in oil & gas world.
4791 2018-07-16 15:32:44 He did get us out of a recession, some would argue we were never out of it. He also crippled the oil, gas and coal industries with ridiculous regulations. He almost destroyed healthcare in America as we know it. Obama's GDP never got above 2.5 %. Worst in History.

4797 2018-07-16 15:32:23 Putin: we are aware of the stance of President Trump, but we as major oil and gas producer and the US can cooperate in the global regulation of energy.
4798 2018-07-16 15:32:21 Oil Bam there it is!!!
4799 2018-07-16 15:32:20 Putin: "We as a major oil and gas power, and the United States as a major oil and gas power as well, can work together on international regulation of markets."
4800 2018-07-16 15:32:19 HELSINKI —

Putin:

“We are aware of the stance of President Trump and we as a a major oil and gas power, and US is a major oil and gas power as well.

“We could work together on the regulating of oil markets.”
4801 2018-07-16 15:32:15 Ohhhhhhhh, he just mentioned about the pipeline, oil, gas

4802 2018-07-16 15:32:15 No! Russia is not our competitor.
It has an economy the size of Italy.
Other than oil and gas, it doesn’t have any other exports #TreasonSummit

4804 2018-07-16 15:32:14 Russia's sagging economy got a boost when trump withdrew us from the JCPOA.
That act requires re-imposing sanctions on Iranian oil, which requires European and Asian countries to reduce their imports from Iran, thus increasing demand (and price) for Russian oil.

4806 2018-07-16 15:32:10 A healthy alternative to vegetable oil for cooking is high-quality virgin coconut oil.
4807 2018-07-16 15:32:10 Putin says the two can work together on regulation of oil and gas markets.
4808 2018-07-16 15:32:08 @realDonaldTrump do not sell our oil
4809 2018-07-16 15:32:00 Trump has no idea what the LNG question means or the pitfalls built in.
He's babbling about oil and gas and he's falling back on verbal ticks to try to cover the bullshit.
4810 2018-07-16 15:31:57 Trump just said that we were number one in oil and gas but.....we aren’t?????
4811 2018-07-16 15:31:57 now the oil pipeline comes up
4812 2018-07-16 15:31:57 Largest in the oil and gas world? Us????
4813 2018-07-16 15:31:56 So he blames Merkel & Germany for buying Russian oil but not Russia for selling it it Europe

4816 2018-07-16 15:31:50 DJT: We will be competing in regards to the gas pipeline. We are now the largest in the oil and gas world. I wish the parties luck. I know where theyre coming from.

4818 2018-07-16 15:31:46 $30 for an oil change? With what money omgg
4819 2018-07-16 15:31:39 Sometimes you read shit online what other ppl from a country thinks of ppl who are trying to escape war torn countries bcuz of oil money and big interest involvement and I loose all hope in this world. There is 0 compassion and 0 ability to connect in humans its heartbreaking
4820 2018-07-16 15:31:36 US is now largest competitor in oil and gas. 
WHAAAT?
4821 2018-07-16 15:31:28 It was  Olive oil that used a rope to break the bracelet
4822 2018-07-16 15:31:26 Trump says he didn't call Putin an "adversary." He says he called him a "competitor" in the oil and gas world. #LiveonK2

4827 2018-07-16 15:30:59 No, actually Chavez nationalized the oil industry and, not having a clue what he was doing, Venezuela’s oil market went in the crapper. Anyway, it’s been a hoot. You’re not changing my mind & vice versa, so have a nice day. Off to work for me.

4829 2018-07-16 15:30:32 so long as this pipeline is not to bring jobs to a cpc based province only and to keep us doing our own business  fine - however oil is on the way out and that is too much to spend on an old dirty fuel source - better to spend on new sources here already that need a leg up
4830 2018-07-16 15:30:30 Never thought Putin would ever let the US attack Iran. That regime is an important buffer for him and they have common interests re: oil and Syria. He was willing to let Trump a little room if it meant that sanctions could be lifted. That's not happening.
4831 2018-07-16 15:30:29 Just days after Libya reopened its eastern oil ports and started to ramp up production that had been offline for weeks, production at one of largest oil fields, Sharara, is expected to drop 160,000 bpd as oil workers were abducted on Saturday & oil wells closed as a precaution.

I know you want gas low but why was gas at almost $4 at $100+ why is it $3+ at $70 it is not the price of oil it is the refinery
4851 2018-07-16 15:28:19 We want people to reduce oil purchases to zero, but in certain cases if people can't do that overnight, we'll consider exceptions," Mnuchin told reporters on Friday while traveling to Mexico, Reuters reported. The comments were under embargo until Monday morning.

4911 2018-07-16 15:23:14 #4. I know. let’s allow tech billionaires & other billionaires like the Kochs and Mercers do this for oil refining. 

Let’s have them go into a state & start up a refinery & not ask one oilman what & how things should be done. Hey, they’ve put gas in their car. They know.

4919 2018-07-16 15:22:32 And then do the same with nukes. Do a spreadsheet with all the cost, from cradle to grace. Factor in final storage of spent fuel and decommissioning debris, factor in a true insurance for accidents, etc. The whole nine yards.

And then compare oil, nuke and RE on eye level.

4934 2018-07-16 15:21:20 We are the mammals who access and create MORE resources: we drill the wells, plant the crops, mine for gold, drill for oil, plant more trees. There are 10k types of birth control available, yet we’ve murdered more of our own unborn children than Jews killed by Hitler.
4935 2018-07-16 15:21:20 The Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, which ensures that American taxpayers are not left holding the bag to clean up when Big Oil makes a mess, had quietly sunsetted on New Year’s Day has been temporarily revived but will be expiring again on January 1, 2019.

4938 2018-07-16 15:21:04 Bullshit. No one ever asked for EROI when the petroleum age came up. I urge you, summarize and quantify all the refinerys, tanker ships, pipelines built, the wells drilled, the crude oil spills, the entire oil infrastructure...

Add it all up, figure out the CO2 expenditure.

4957 2018-07-16 15:18:57 Oil Production benchmark which is projected at 2.3million barrels per day is overly optimistic. Nigeria is presently producing about 1.86mbpd. That puts a serious dent on the oil revenue projection of N2.99tn. #PACESeries #2018Budget

5066 2018-07-16 15:07:31 IMF cuts India FY20 GDP growth forecast by 30 bps to 7.5%. It has cut India GDP forecast as high oil prices to hit local demand. and monetary policy may tighten faster. How faster we grow this is the proof from IMF. so safed jhut mat bolo sir aapki gaarima ko sobha ni deta....

5068 2018-07-16 15:07:26 It largely depends on how many individuals are receiving the payment.  If just a few, then likely the government.  If many individuals are paid (think AK oil dividend), people seem to better recognize benefits than if the money was all going to the government.

5077 2018-07-16 15:06:46 Repealing a safety standard, allowing for deforestation of one area, oil drilling in a whale refuge. They do that just so they can win, *this* is rule by minority, the working class having sovereignty over itself, controlling production, is not minority rule.

5093 2018-07-16 15:06:08 Yeah and I got an oil change I should have waited on because I thought I was good.  Oh well, 2 days of over draft fees won't hurt too much.
5094 2018-07-16 15:05:59 Dr of what mythology or gobbledygook? UK emits just 1.2% of the 4% of Co2 emissions related to fossil fuel usage Wind&Solar weather dependant without fossil fuels how do you run NHS 24/7? Without portability of oil how does iron ore from Australia get to UK for wind turbines??
5095 2018-07-16 15:05:58 Also Oil is 67.00 a barrel today and going down 3 percent as we speak!Media is fake news and fake numbers so what good are they

5100 2018-07-16 15:05:40 Who cares what Germany says about us. They went behind our back & are colluding with Russia on receiving oil from them.Where's the outrage? If you guys love Europe so much and want the US to be like it save us the nonstop complaining & move there.

5103 2018-07-16 15:05:25 Close the Strait of Hormuz and see where oil prices go and what impact it has on our allies. I'm trying to be kind here, but for someone running for a national office...she's dumb as a box of rocks.
5104 2018-07-16 15:05:17 What plain facts? I have to ask you again, who are you trying to represent? You don't make any sense. Arguing that animation is good or bad based on frame rates, as you're doing, is like saying that art is good or bad simply because it's done in oil. Explain yourself better.
5105 2018-07-16 15:05:14 It's not censorship or a violation of freedom of speech to stop people (LIKE YOU) from spreading hate and trying to incite people to commit violence, all the while selling fake snake oil products to gullible consumers. You should be in jail.
5106 2018-07-16 15:05:04 Good luck for anyone who belives that Russia will "kick/police/moderate" Iran out from Syria... "Russian companies are expected to invest over $50 billion in development of oil and gas fields in Iran, Tass reported" (April 2018).
5107 2018-07-16 15:05:03 So true.  Lastly, USD is screwed since US is still the largest importer of oil behind China. Most forget ~6 million bod net comes in.

5109 2018-07-16 15:04:43 John Harwood says that Trump's meeting with Putin is to further his personal interests not those of the United States.  Harwood openly speculates against Trump at all times.  CNBC needs to fire Harwood to protect whatever integrity they might have.  #fireharwood

5113 2018-07-16 15:04:28 1. oil will be ... cheaper?
2. US senate will approve additional debt?
It will not hurt China, it is state regulated economy, they can print Yuans much longer than US can print USD without hurting economy. China may ignore own losses because of strategic goal: to weaken US.

5119 2018-07-16 15:03:51 @Actor_Irfankhan cancer; First stop all sugar intake, wt sugar cancer cell would die natural death. 2nd step is 2 blend a whole lemon fruit with a cup hot water n drink 1-3 months first thing b4food. 3rd drink 3 spoonfuls organic coconut oil, mornn night n cancer would disappear
5120 2018-07-16 15:03:51 So what? 96% of Co2 emissions are natural only 4% related to fossil fuels you could shut down every use of coal oil and gas and atmospherically it would make no difference Without Co2 everything dies because Co2 essential to photosynthesis H2O+Co2 = photosynthesis Grade School?
5121 2018-07-16 15:03:48 Was it really so difficult to extract that?
Merkel and EU get oil and gas from Russia, which funds their military. 
Trump wants to end that.
So whoever is against that must be for Russia.
Nick is against it because he thinks Trump must be fooling.

5124 2018-07-16 15:03:36 The target country has a valuable resource that it's refusing to share on terms "fair" to the West. Mossadegh nationalized Britain's Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. & US leaders feared that the nationalization would set aprecedent that could undermine corporate power around the ~S.K
5125 2018-07-16 15:03:35 One of these days a man is going to appreciate how good my legs feel and he won’t complain about the coconut oil in the bathtub like mom does...
5126 2018-07-16 15:03:31 10% drop in International Oil prices but only price increases by the Govt. in the past two weeks. Oil maybe BJP's Waterloo just as Onions were for the Congress.
5127 2018-07-16 15:03:26 Trump is so desperate to get his share of that $500+ billion oil deal.

5134 2018-07-16 15:02:50 Well, I am not a big fan of large scale geo-engineering so avoiding emissions is indeed the best way forward. If you'd funnel all coal and oil subsidies into renewables and storage solutions, we'd make huge progress with that.

5143 2018-07-16 15:02:04 To this day, I am still impressed by the performance difference immediately after a vehicle's oil change.
5144 2018-07-16 15:02:04 It is, when involves hauling an oil tanker through the Burrard Inlet and Metro Vancouver with 650 000 barrels of toxic, flammable more than once each day and 7X’s more, putting the residents and sensitive ecosystem at risk from a fire or oil spill.
5145 2018-07-16 15:02:01 cancer; First stop all sugar intake, wt sugar cancer cell would die natural death. 2nd step is 2 blend a whole lemon fruit with a cup of hot water and drink for 1-3 months first thing before food. 3rd drink 3 spoonfuls of organic coconut oil, mornn night n cancer would disappear.

5183 2018-07-16 14:59:27 Really ?
And yet known and unknown regions are referred to in relation to oil revenue.
UK gov used the reasoning that" because the produce never touched UK port" it was impossible to allocate the revenue to any particular region

I’d like to actually get some water-soluble stuff cause I bet it’s more workable. Toothpick is a good suggestion, thanks! Currently using some old dental equipment
5203 2018-07-16 14:57:08 They kill on allies soil, kill journalists & opposition, have an oil only economy, supports Iran, NK, Assad, a dictator state, What do they have that we want? They have always been adversarial & will always be...We have everything they want we have the upper hand..Why b friends?

5205 2018-07-16 14:57:03 @campaigncc Demand 36.78GW Wind 0.90GW You do know that wind & solar are weather dependant don't you? How does the NHS work without coal gas oil and nuclear giving 24/7 reliability of supply? Does changing habits mean people dying to save the planet??
5206 2018-07-16 14:56:55 Yesterday my hair was so dry and brittle, I used coconut oil and today it feels so much healthier!
5207 2018-07-16 14:56:48 Imagine if you owned Freeport McMoran bc you want copper assets.  Then you wake up one morning and they buy deep sea oil and gas assets.  Then you say, wtf?
5208 2018-07-16 14:56:47 i had so much oil on at the pool party, i was frying like some chicken

5211 2018-07-16 14:56:28 @Racheldoesstuff Song idea for #CrazyExGirlfriend Rachel sings what can only be described as a very poor sea shanty. Sample lyrics: “I was left out at sea like I was plastic - so tragic! So I spilled their blood like oil - climate change’ll make it boil! Also, my wife’s the sea!”
5212 2018-07-16 14:56:22 お疲れ様でした。。（でも面白かったです）
5213 2018-07-16 14:56:20 Russia is a third rate country - Fun Fact Russia's GDP isn't even in the Top 10 of World  . If you took away Russia's oil- they would literally be like North Korean . A failed third world country with nukes. You have to wonder why Trump is giving them any respect  #treasonsummit
5214 2018-07-16 14:56:19 I have a palo santo essential oil as well as frankincense that I use for cleansing spaces. I put a drop on all my chakras to release any negativity.

5216 2018-07-16 14:56:10 He will thank Putin for his support. Putin will ask Trump how much more $ he needs & promise to give it to him as soon as Trump lifts the sanctions. GOP wants that Exxon oil!
5217 2018-07-16 14:56:03 I really wish you could make appointments for oil changes.. been here 2 hours
5218 2018-07-16 14:55:55 We need fast shifting to E-two wheelers,E-Rickshas, E-Cars,E- Buses and E-Trucks, supported by Solar Power as  we are unable to control, the oil prices.This activity if started sooner, it will be better for the Country.@narendramodi @nitin_gadkari @sureshpprabhu @myogiadityanath
5219 2018-07-16 14:55:49 Exfoliate well beforehand, top up every couple of days, use a cream sun cream not oil, moisturise all the time and pay dry after a shower don't rub 
5220 2018-07-16 14:55:41 1 not pish , demographic proportion of oil revenue returned to Scotland.
2. Am not SNP , am reformed Labour.
5221 2018-07-16 14:55:34 It's one of those "investments" that only make sense when you realize money is loose in China relative to partners, so payment in oil future deliveries paid for in current RERs is a great hedge against deval pressure even with the default risk.
5222 2018-07-16 14:55:31 I have never seen anyone in Northern Alberta working the oil patch that wears a cowboy hat. Are you okay Theo? I feel like you’ve been drinking some of that UCP koolaid. You know they are delusional, lying, hateful bigots right? Sad.
5223 2018-07-16 14:55:21 Trump wants Russian-oligarch-status: that translates into wide-open hotel building permits and a piece of Rosnoft oil deal when that comes to fruition.  Trump's move has to be: Get rid of Magnitsky.

5235 2018-07-16 14:54:43 @realDonaldTrump 
Ya know you go and put down Germany for getting 9% of their oil from Russia...but you fail to mention the 500 million $ u received PERSONALLY for allowing Qatar to LAUNDER RUSSIAN MONEY thru a FAKE buy of the state of russia oil co...that they BOUGHT RIGHT BACK!
5236 2018-07-16 14:54:40 It didn't even take THAT... all it took was a #SCOTUS appointment, THEN all it took was a meeting with Putin and BAMB... nobody cared about #SCOTUS anymore ...  and all it will take is (fill in the blank) and they won't care about PUTIN any more... and THEN.. you get the picture

5238 2018-07-16 14:54:37 Maybe we should focus on all those oil platforms instead?

5240 2018-07-16 14:54:31 Getting oil from ur masters and giving them in return food since those desert ppl don't hve any agriculture, is purely business, they r not giving us anything for free, now since ur coward ancestors converted and became slaves of those desert dacoits , u expect others to do same

5249 2018-07-16 14:53:42 Our new oil trio is ready, we should be able to take control of the Northern Canadian pass soon. Also our business contracts we created a decade ago will make it hard to prove collusion during election  #TreasonSummit
5250 2018-07-16 14:53:22 To be perfectly honest, we need to make amends to most of the world.

We created a refugee crisis

We slay women and children in the streets

We prop up 73% of world dictators

We are in 8 illegal wars

900 military based globally

We do it all for oil and gas to prop up the $$$

5258 2018-07-16 14:52:19 Go Texas!
Curious what percentage of the Texas $1.7T yearly economy is OIL?
I'd say 25%.
So even removing energy, Texas still has +$1T yearly economy.
Amazing
God Bless Texas!

5264 2018-07-16 14:51:58 regardless of technicals, oil going lower is hugely bullish.
5265 2018-07-16 14:51:42 Great trade by G-Man on shorting oil. $SCO was the way to go! Congrats to the members on an awesome Monday profit.
5266 2018-07-16 14:51:39 I think education is key here. CBD oil can really be helpful to people who are genuinely suffering. It's not a Cheech and Chong movie.
5267 2018-07-16 14:51:28 Stop cleansing oil is not for everyone :)
5268 2018-07-16 14:51:20 Once I get my oil changed it’s over for you hoes
5269 2018-07-16 14:51:16 In the oil and gas sector, minerals, and military they are certainly competitors.
5270 2018-07-16 14:51:07 That would certainly be an epic plot twist..

5272 2018-07-16 14:50:48 That is true. They shouldn’t rely on us the tax payer to protect them. Why should we? They have their own money. So much of it that they can buy oil from the very country they want protection from. Why are you spinning this as another Trump bashing moment?

5292 2018-07-16 14:48:56 You better not be paying 90$ for an oil change...
5293 2018-07-16 14:48:54 What's wrong with being an oil tycoon? Jealous? Class envy? ONLY to socialist, is wealth an enemy. I guess you're stuck at McDonald's ? Take heart, the economy is rolling and I hear Golden Coral is hiring. I'm HAPPY where I'm at, living in a country full of wealth and opportunity

5298 2018-07-16 14:48:13 If pushing NATO to strengthen their militaries and telling Germany not to buy Russian oil is traitorous I'll take it. Putting America on a very strong stance against Russia is a good thing.

5336 2018-07-16 14:45:22 ?????So Trump thumps Germany for buying oil and gas from Russia, then makes nice to Russia who’s selling it to Germany? Trump thumps EU allies and admires Putin for being the type of “strong man” he strives to be?

5621 2018-07-16 14:20:08 I need a good hot oil treatment and a hair masque
5622 2018-07-16 14:20:07 When your fish oil pills break in your pocket an hour into your morning.....I love Monday 
5623 2018-07-16 14:19:54 Says Merkel, who leads Germany & says they need the US funded NATO alliance to protect them from Russia yet does billions of dollars in oil business w/ Russia...can we trust Germany? Was last years 685 billion the US spent worth it? I say keep the alliance but trim down the costs
5624 2018-07-16 14:19:47 LEMON FACIAL MASK  

This face mask is very simple!! 

mix the juice from 1 lemon with 1/4 cup of olive oil OR sweet almond oil.
apply to your face and let sit before washing off and patting dry 
5625 2018-07-16 14:19:28 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
5626 2018-07-16 14:19:26 I’d rather be a Pep Boy and check dudes’ oil.
5627 2018-07-16 14:19:26 Good that there is a move against corporate big oil dominating the financial and biological health of your population. The good old oil boys are not good. They put money before people. Erin Brockovich where are you?
5628 2018-07-16 14:19:26 30分前まで泊めてくれるって言ってた人が急に駄目になったと言ってきた理由を考えつつ急ぎ家路
5629 2018-07-16 14:19:17 I've gone for a combination of sudafed, olbas oil, paracetamol, bed and PS4.
5630 2018-07-16 14:19:16 oh!イル
5631 2018-07-16 14:19:00 Tapi kat Malaysia skrg oil & gas dah catching up. InsyaAllah byk projek nak jalan balik
5632 2018-07-16 14:18:59 I'm sure China wonders what has happened between them and US.  Now I've read that China is boycotting purchasing US oil (China is US' 2nd largest export of oil).  Things are going to get nasty very quickly.
5633 2018-07-16 14:18:56 I hate going to get my oil changed 
5634 2018-07-16 14:18:55 only i would ruin my phone by spilling cuticle oil on it while i was sleeping
5635 2018-07-16 14:18:47 残念みが深い
5636 2018-07-16 14:18:47 Russia is an energy economy. Trump has ANWR & Coal unleashed & can’t take oil down to $15 a barrel which would crush the Russian RuPaul and economy as well as the Saudis. Trump can get whatever he wants by force but he has a business plan that’s even better.
5637 2018-07-16 14:18:40 I'm sure you'll be ready with some baby oil and a shoulder massage for those days when LeBron is especially frustrated.
5638 2018-07-16 14:18:35 ใครก็ได้บอกพี่แทคที โทรค่ะโทร55555
5639 2018-07-16 14:18:26 Seriously? Who here in my Facebook world hasn’t tried CBD oil yet?  
5640 2018-07-16 14:18:16 You can also use the reactor to do some initial upgrading and hydrogenation of the oil to make it easier to transport. I filed a patent in Canada to do just that. Nuclear heat is some amazing stuff
5641 2018-07-16 14:18:13 นอกจากทวิตติดเงาบ่อยก็โดนยกเลิกของบ่อยนี่แหละ สงสารน้องเจอแบบนี้บ่อยจองแล้วชอบไม่โอน
5642 2018-07-16 14:18:06 What Siya says kinda makes sense yazi. They’re supposed to enhance. But with him it’s weird cause he has the beard as he says, it just shrunk with Jamaican beard oil.
5643 2018-07-16 14:18:04 Commerzbank commodities analyst Carsten Fritsch said the outlook for supply was unclear, with news of disruptions from several oil producers, but Saudi Arabia and Russia had reminded the market of their determination to pump more oil if needed.
5644 2018-07-16 14:18:03 #SaturatedFats are also found in a few vegetable oils, such as palm oil, coconut oil, hydrogenated oils, and chocolate. #HeartHealth
5645 2018-07-16 14:18:01 @BarbequeNation Oil stained clothes while having dinner at your Faridabad outlet was the experience  you gave us. Horrible place to have dinner.
5646 2018-07-16 14:17:50 But US is a quiet big net importers at the time so 200$/  of oil (a quiet fair number given the nature of imperial system) is just a pure political suicide.
But since US oil net imports kind of shrunk in recent years...
Suddenly that makes a lot of sense.
5647 2018-07-16 14:17:38 Russia and other oil producers could raise output by 1 million barrels per day (bpd) or more if shortages hit the market, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak told reporters on Friday.
5648 2018-07-16 14:17:38 We don't know about you guys... but we're pretty sure jojoba oil is where it's at. Find it in your Aussie faves like 3 Minute Miracle Moist!! #AUSSomeHair
5649 2018-07-16 14:17:33 get some tea tree oil and dilute it and use it on your problem areas!! it saved my life
5650 2018-07-16 14:17:31 It's the oil rights under the Arctic Ocean they are after. Putin wants to own more than his share. Trump is complicit.There will be a world war there.
5651 2018-07-16 14:17:28 We have Putin and Russia by the balls.  Their economy is smaller than Italy's and they manufacture no consumer goods that we need.  We don't need their oil or gas.  The sanctions are working.  There is nothing in it for us if (when) concessions are made by Trump
5652 2018-07-16 14:17:22 Worst part about waiting for an oil change is that I forgot my headphones!  #fail

5655 2018-07-16 14:16:50 Delighted to report that our @LondonSouthEast oil & gas event tomorrow night is sold out - woo!! D
5656 2018-07-16 14:16:34 Unless she's vaping actual essential oils?
Wouldn't rule that out. Especially as many refer to juice as 'oil'.
5657 2018-07-16 14:16:33 今日のむぎし可愛かった
5658 2018-07-16 14:16:26 Thank you @MYANC! @CyrilRamaphosa we are still waiting for someone to be held accountable for selling the oil reserves! Can't even walk places in this country since crime is so high 
5659 2018-07-16 14:16:17 @OneyNG hey man did you ever consider doing any oil and canvas stuff, id pay big pay pig bucks for it (if i had any). Could be a fun hobby either way lad id love to see it
5660 2018-07-16 14:16:02 Η Motor Oil έκλεισε στα 17,50 ευρώ με απώλειες 1,13% όγκο 70 χιλ. τεμάχια και αποτίμηση 1,93 δισ. ευρώ
5661 2018-07-16 14:15:53 How long would that last? Algeria’s doing better on the fiscal side with current oil prices but still has a gaping gap. No where is safe.
5662 2018-07-16 14:15:52 Average guy doesn't care about dead journalist/Airline.. particular if they think about freedom of Yeltsin years. But agree he has been v lucky with oil & gas prices not sure their economic model is sustainable in long run.. but then don't see EU giving up Gas Either
5663 2018-07-16 14:15:52 Michelle Caruso-Cabrera on CNBC propagating the lie that Germany is dependent on Russia for their oil.  #theyhelphimlie

5665 2018-07-16 14:15:45 At the #UNSC on #Libya (@UNSMILibya): @GhassanSalame regrets that violence within the last two months has diverted some of the progress toward the national action plan. Specifically cites the June 14 attacks by militias on facilities in the Oil Crescent.

5668 2018-07-16 14:15:34 US markets today opened flat as a drop in oil prices dampened investment strength. The Dow rose 0.02% at the open, the S&P 500 opened higher by 0.12 points, or 0.00% and the Nasdaq 0.07% at the opening bell. #markets @i24NEWS_EN

5670 2018-07-16 14:15:30 Castor oil!
5671 2018-07-16 14:15:29 I travelled through Benue sometime in the past. I saw heaps of mangoes and oranges wasting away. Benue should have alot of food factories but that won't happen yet because we are still sharing crude oil money. WASTED COUNTRY!
5672 2018-07-16 14:15:22 For real, my beard was a li longer and fuller in volume because initially I were using beard wax, after weeks and weeks of castor oil it lessened.
5673 2018-07-16 14:15:21 Has Trump in any way evidenced that he wants to challenge Russia? He wants to sit on Putin's lap and have a lollipop. Trump want's to lift sanctions, start building hotels and profit from oil production. His foreign policy is transparent—he wants to line his families pockets.

5676 2018-07-16 14:15:09 Breaking news: evangelical extremists began drilling for oil in a group of New York Times reporters, but you were too distracted by Trump's tweets to notice.
5677 2018-07-16 14:15:09 #Trump
- doesn’t kiss the queen
- sits in the chair
- demands NATO pay their fair share
- and could blow up the Russian oil pipeline if they bitch
5678 2018-07-16 14:15:08 If any other Govt was ruling this country since 2014, we would have achieved tremendous growth, as oil prices were down and India saved billions of dollars on oil imports. But Modi govt destroyed a golden chance, which could be disastrous for us in near future.
5679 2018-07-16 14:15:03 Who are you, snake oil salesman?
5680 2018-07-16 14:14:50 Sear elderberry and parsnip. Complete with lots of olive oil.
5681 2018-07-16 14:14:49 In UNSC briefings on the situation in Libya @UNSMILibya, SRSG Salamé cites an "event" in the oil crescent wherein oil fields were seized by non-state forces and then freed again by Libya national forces.  Oil sales losses to Libya were as high as $900 million.
5682 2018-07-16 14:14:38 I used to buy the ordinary, niacinamide, moisturizer, salicic acid, aha bha then i decided to do diet for my skincare and start using ufo oil from sunday riley. I’m acne prone oily skin

5685 2018-07-16 14:14:24 Oil prices slipped earlier on Monday as concerns about supply disruptions eased and Libyan ports reopened.

5689 2018-07-16 14:14:08 As perverse as those tapes Putin owns and probably shared with North Korea, to get an oil deal there after Trump’s visit.
5690 2018-07-16 14:14:07 It was A really bad idea for your great grand dad to sell oil to HITLER!!! But hey who’s paying attention right? PUTZ! BUSHES = GLOBALISTS = do anything g for the family dollar!!!!!
5691 2018-07-16 14:14:06 You know the universe doesn't care about you when your bio professor tells you that you're made of water surrounded by tiny layers of oil.
5692 2018-07-16 14:14:04 #OIL with this pace it can break below 68$ today.....sorry trolls....you get what you deserve

5695 2018-07-16 14:13:54 Oil falls 2%, below $70, as Treasury says importers may get leeway to buy Iranian crude, despite sanctions
5696 2018-07-16 14:13:41 I would like to find out more about the inflation constraint too. But the US has run deficits for a very long time - sometimes very large - and we have never experienced that constraint kick in a meaningful way. Late 70s/80s - oil more than deficits?
5697 2018-07-16 14:13:30 Eucalyptus essential oil behind your ears and along the back of your neck will keep them away. They HATE the smell. Peppermint, lavender, and lemon oils should also work
5698 2018-07-16 14:13:19 Senator Lieu, this is not a summit meeting. It is a Putin lead intel debrief on what @realDonaldTrump can remember that is why it took longer than 2 hrs. Trump trying to prove his worth to Putin for his monitory gain during office.
5699 2018-07-16 14:12:58 ok so I’m at the car dealership and I’m waiting to get an oil change and I’m also hungry, should I.....
5700 2018-07-16 14:12:53 My doctor recommended Cbd oil to me
5701 2018-07-16 14:12:50 Silicone doesn't hold heat, paper does. Try using a wee bit of oil in the silicone, I find that can work, or butter, just a weeeeeeeee tiny amount. Works best in fan assisted ovens that hack. C
5702 2018-07-16 14:12:38 The best way to stop oil pipelines is to cut back on oil use. Be willing to put up with some inconvenience to save the world -- less driving, less flying, less climate control, less plastic. It's not up to the oil companies, it's up to us. #TheEndUserIsTheProblem #StopTheDemand
5703 2018-07-16 14:12:35 Depends on how much truffle oil you're gonna use. ;)

5712 2018-07-16 14:11:42 He may have fuelled matters but #CorbynOut poored oil onto the fires-what was it-oh yes "wholesale immigration' and aligned himself with the Alt Right ideals.

We should not let him off either and nor will we forget.

5722 2018-07-16 14:10:23 I agree with the #Drawdown concept, except that I would apply it to everything that affluent classes in affluent societies overuse, overaccumulate, overexploit and overwaste: oil, mining in its broadest sense, construction, wood, fishing, eating, dressing, travelling, etc.
5723 2018-07-16 14:10:17 Price River Oil Spill Update: Good news: Great progress made on cleanup. Only 750 gallons of crude hit the river with much of it contained on bridge. Bad news: Flash flood last night wiped out containment booms. @utahdeq assessing damage .

5735 2018-07-16 14:08:44 That doesn’t suck, lol! I like spinach. When I was young, my Gram used to mix them with mashed potatoes and probably used olive oil more than butter. I ended up loving spinach this way:-).

5738 2018-07-16 14:08:38 @Nigerianbadass why is palm oil and salt not to be used during the initiation?
5739 2018-07-16 14:08:30 They take crude down a couple of bucks on the weekly Monday Tuesday Fakedown of oil, so when it goes up a buck and a half on Wednesday we think we are winning. #Winning
5740 2018-07-16 14:08:29 i really like coconut oil to use every so often (especially in the winter) bc it acts as an anti inflammatory. it really helps with my rosacea and also has eliminated the dry peely areas of my nose. its a super heavy oil but i have severely dry skin so i love her
5741 2018-07-16 14:08:28 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
5742 2018-07-16 14:08:27 Ana . Unfortunately there’s no money or oil in Nicaragua and you very well know that this administration doesn’t care about the people of Nicaragua or the ones at the border ..
5743 2018-07-16 14:08:24 Can't have crisis-level issue in your major cities and ignore. Poloz was focused on national interest when he  rates 50 basis points for the oil patch.  Problem is rates were too low preceding that issue. His recent comments are "we're behind;" wonder why?Issue is inflation..

5745 2018-07-16 14:08:05 Hypothetically speaking Can you imagine if Trump came back with an oil deal or denuclearization plan from Putin?

5752 2018-07-16 14:06:56 Federalism has its good points and bad points, the absence of internal free trade being one of the latter. A good point is smaller government in the areas of provincial jurisdiction - and provincial oil revenue. Bad point: lack of uniform standards/licensing of trades/professions
5753 2018-07-16 14:06:53 Sanctions didn’t make a bit of difference? The cuts in western investment in Russia beg to differ. The cuts in lending to Russians beg to differ. The curbs on Russian oil begs to differ. The assistance to elect a Russia friendly puppet President begs to difffer..

5758 2018-07-16 14:06:18 Yeah I think that might be a part of it but it's absolutely ridiculous. We literally subsidize everything we do with energy already. 40 percent of our calories started out as oil or natural gas

1. If you have healthy skin, its okay to use only. soap n cleanser. Soap/cleanser will remove dirts & also your sebum(oil) from skin. Normal skin will replenish back the sebum within hours. In our study, around 4-6 hours.

5781 2018-07-16 14:03:54 It’s time to leave Germany to defend for themselves. They are far from fair trade, charging 25% on America products. They refused to pay fair amount for NATO defense. Deal with Russia for gas and oil, who NATO is protecting Germany from. Giving Russia billions to build military
5782 2018-07-16 14:03:46 The price of crude oil is the major reason for #fuelpricehike and it is not @CyrilRamaphosa fault.
What however his government failed to do was predict it was going to happen and not raise the VAT they did in April 1. 1/2
5783 2018-07-16 14:03:46 Trump doesn’t care because Nicaragua doesn’t have oil reserves!
5784 2018-07-16 14:03:27 Thanks for the info! I am delving into the truth and appreciate any information on the matter. Please send me some links to research this. Jesus was executed for taking the Holy oil from the priests and giving it to the common man. He also told that the priests were sons of Cain.
5785 2018-07-16 14:03:24 Private corporations and businesses "buy oil".  Are you suggesting that the Canadian government completely regulate these decisions.  Sounds a bit like nationalization?  Part of a national strategy or "energy program"?

5791 2018-07-16 14:02:41 The bigger issue is how the batteries are getting charged. Converting natural gas, fuel oil and/or coal to electricity to charge your electric car is worse than using CNG, gas to power a regular car as there is a net loss in converting one form of energy into another.

5809 2018-07-16 14:01:07 Absolutely. It’s completely safe for her.

5830 2018-07-16 13:59:03 With 20% in Oil imports, China alone takes a huge chunk out of the import. Let alone that import/export revenue is the only tax revenue. 
Does 60% of the fossil fuel exports go in general to Europa. That is realistic. 
Is it 60% of Russias revenue? Nooo ... by far not.

5876 2018-07-16 13:54:42 @FoxNews @MariaBartiromo Trump has the power to take oil as low as $15 a barrel. ANWR, Clean Coal, Off shore oil

POTUS Trump can sink the Russian and Saudi’s into bankruptcy if he wants to making their currencies worthless. Extreme? Yes. It’s called leverage

5880 2018-07-16 13:54:23 Yes, quite the shady character.  Bigamist and con artist.  Used to cash $3,000 Standard Oil checks ($80k today) at the bank in Park River and would act surprised and pretend that he thought they were only $300.  All to preserve his hidden identity.
5881 2018-07-16 13:54:22 But we'll be paying for last months oil?  Or whatever deficit there may have been?  That's why it always takes a while longer than expected for petrol prices tocome down when the currency strengthens or oil price falls.

5889 2018-07-16 13:53:50 No, Mike Adams, aka the HealthRanger, is a dyed in the wool American shyster. He has created an online empire distributing misinformation and selling snake oil, similar to Alex Jones or  Mercola.

5891 2018-07-16 13:53:40 #morningjoe  Joe. You really agree with your guest that Russia is a minor local power with 4,000 military jets, 20,000 main battle tanks, 350 ships, 6850 nuclear warheads and 10.5mm bpd oil output?  It’s not the “good old days of 1970” for Soviet power but really?

5898 2018-07-16 13:52:28 LOL. So that's why Trump is meeting with Putin this week to sort out who gets what piece of land and access to oil deposits is it? ?? Why is Trump & Putin so involved in getting UK out of EU? Hoping domino effect on EU? Why? Because they want everything for themselves? Naive.

5902 2018-07-16 13:51:59 Under Pres Trump, America has destroyed Russia's oil-dependent economy by becoming the world's top oil producer, while standing with only Middle Eastern democracy, Israel.  America stands with friends:
for: Democracy, Tolerance, Capitalism
against: Communism, Terrorism, Sharia
5903 2018-07-16 13:51:52 have you rented a bunch of oil consumptions in the last week

5905 2018-07-16 13:51:40 Well, good luck making that argument to consumers or the global crude oil market. It's a great way to signal virtue on social media, but markets don't function like that and refineries don't behave like that.
5906 2018-07-16 13:51:35 It's close enough to socialism to be a disaster. Sanctions are no excuse for an oil rich country to fail at providing basics such as food.

5914 2018-07-16 13:50:55 Weather does not equal Climate Change.

81 years ago we were still in the midst of the uptrend in climate change because of industry’s reliance on coal as an energy source. Adding increased usage of oil as an energy source in the 1950’s caused a steeper trend.

They walked in looking for her 30 seconds after she left.
5927 2018-07-16 13:49:29 Trump is in a position much like Ronald Reagan was only stronger to completely sink the Russian economy using energy resources which Trump has unleashed in the USA and is continuing to unleash. Clean coal, ANWAR, offshore oil. Trump can take oil to $15

Is it any wonder Russian is in the Middle East?
Why isn't the Left against European collusion?
Why don't they love Trump trying to get USA gas into Europe?

Talking sanctions
Talking about screwing with our election

5963 2018-07-16 13:45:08 Perhaps if a faction was seeking to undermine an existing and established election process, intervention could be justified.

5964 2018-07-16 13:45:04 Mexico will pay for the wall.   The meeting with the Russians was about adoptions.  Germany gets 50-60% oil from Russia (7% is the number).   Do you need more lies?

5969 2018-07-16 13:44:29 By Gawd those ultimate recovery profiles are awful looking. Much higher well costs are resulting in higher IP180+ but steeper declines.  And ...23% of all HZ unconventional shale oil wells drilled before 2015 now only contribute 23% of total LTO production?  Holy Schnikes !!
5970 2018-07-16 13:44:01 Yep, kids paid for half their vehicles, all insurance, maintenance. They learned to change the oil so they didn't have to pay someone else to do it. We paid for cheap phones as a bit of comfort for us. When they wanted smart phones? They bought them and paid the bill lol.

5974 2018-07-16 13:43:47 Unsure it's at all clear IMO'll lead to a big rise in #oil for powergen. Nearly all big economies have moved away from it, even for legacy plant. Any rise would be in hard to reach areas, and distributed oilgen is mostly gasoil. New plant is CCGT, distributed gas, or renewables.

5986 2018-07-16 13:42:12 There are no cooperative solutions.

It's a lie. Efforts in that direction as so ineffective, the cultural push in that direction was probably originally funded by the oil industry.
5987 2018-07-16 13:42:04 I’m not sure about the #FuelPriceHike for August. The rand has gotten a little stronger. The price of Brent crude oil has dropped. And the reports that say fuel price will increase are based on unaudited reports....

6020 2018-07-16 13:40:11 3) The Holy oil is spoken of over 2 dozen times in the Old testament and ZERO in the New testament. The disciples of Christ were told to go to the tabernackles and anoint the people there. Anointing is inside and out. The Holy oil heals and protects from disease and bugs....
6021 2018-07-16 13:39:44 Seems like Germany & the EU, spending billions on Russian oil & gas are the ones propping up Putin, but Trump was wrong for making that an issue?? Really??

6038 2018-07-16 13:38:32 there's no new tax. its exactly the same as pre-GST. 
RM4billion probably is calculated from 1st September to end of the year. to match the loss of 21b revenue from GST, he is expecting the price of oil and GLCs to make up 14.4b, total 18.4b. the rest is cut out with savings.

6044 2018-07-16 13:37:48 So calling out Germany for spending billions on Russian Oil & Gas was good or bad?  I mean Russia = bad (which I agree), but pointing out that the EU, & especially Germany, is propping them up by buying energy resources from them & thus relying heavily on Russia is also bad?
6045 2018-07-16 13:37:47 You changed the Nescafé Gold in South Africa and it’s disgusting and tastes like motor oil. It’s vile.
6046 2018-07-16 13:37:44 Reduce inflammation: turmeric and fish oil
6047 2018-07-16 13:37:40 Yeah let’s take the oil of a sovereign nation like your daddy suggested... your family would commit a war crime for a profit!
6048 2018-07-16 13:37:27 Here's another tip. Don't road surface redress in the summer . Loose oil covered stones get in on your carpet. Take note Bristol City useless Council
6049 2018-07-16 13:37:15 You're not even old enough to remember, at that time we had full employment, pensions and national pride. The oil crisis and the subsequent world recession put an end to that and the only answer we could think of at the time was something different, namely Thatcher's big sell off
6050 2018-07-16 13:37:13 Sources report hearing lots of heavy breathing & slurping behind the closed door. A room service cart laden with baby oil & wet wipes was seen entering the room as well. The Trump/Putin summit will be climaxing shortly.

6052 2018-07-16 13:36:43 Does Trump have any urinating Russian prostitutes on this SUMMIT? Yeah right. Trump's ass is still angling at profiting from developing Russian oil! Neither Trump not his family would FIGHT to preserve the Trump Organization in Vietnam, Syria, Iraq, Northern Africa, etc.
6053 2018-07-16 13:36:37 Exactly, what do we have to do to keep Germany from giving so many billions to RUSSIA?
Do we need to export more oil?
6054 2018-07-16 13:36:34 @cbdbrothers I was speaking to SamSam @SamSamwhite ("I’ve spoken to Benny") because I got scammed by an american for £600 for oil (& weed - pinned on my page) she said you would be ok to talk how abut a DM?

6057 2018-07-16 13:36:28 Gas prices are going up because the United States is forbidden by GATS to use our own oil productions. We must by treaty buy ours from the private market.
6058 2018-07-16 13:36:26 2) ..because the Old Testament tells us about the TWO trinities. The spiritual and the elemental. "And these three are one". The Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost. The elemental: Earth, Air, Water. Jesus gave us an elemental gift to heal us. The Holy oil of Christ.......

6061 2018-07-16 13:35:59 There is a “fair chance” that Putin will commit to ramping up oil output by a higher level than Russia agreed to last month in coordination with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Pugh said.
6062 2018-07-16 13:35:42 I thought I might do some ironing this afternoon. Sod that, just getting some rays.  I can smell the oil from here!
6063 2018-07-16 13:35:36 Good. 
That reminds me; I had a cat who appeared to be having hip trouble/walking. I gave her cod liver oil, a dropper's full injected at the side of her unwilling mouth.
Amazingly, after some time,  it cleared up whatever was wrong with her hip and she never had any more issues.
6064 2018-07-16 13:35:29 Did you know that the US is now the world's largest oil producer? Thanks @PeterZeihan :)

6070 2018-07-16 13:34:53 Flint still doesn’t have water, Puerto Rico is still devastated, children are still in cages separated from their families, pipelines are spilling oil, Trump is a traitor and the GOP Congress is complicit #ForShameAmerica

6073 2018-07-16 13:34:28 What do you think the Germany should not be buying Russian oil is about..hurting Russia...A friend of Russia would not do that.  But you lefty's ignore that..always speculate against POTUS. Put the crack pipes down and wake up to reality.  @realDonaldTrump is a MAGA Patriot
6074 2018-07-16 13:34:27 "Cowboys hats" = oil & gas in the same way trucker hats = diner servers...?

6076 2018-07-16 13:34:16 I've seen oil and gas pipelines located that way too. I've seen lots of people doubt it, but I know it works.
6077 2018-07-16 13:34:11 Whole idea, starting from "does it stand up as an idea" through to "better as evaporated/steamed, or through a carrier oil", etc.  How "scientific" is it when they say x affects y, is it as rigorous as homeopathy or as frivolous as medical trials...

6079 2018-07-16 13:34:07 As opposed to nuke plants w/elements radioactive for 1000s of years, strip mining damage from coal & whatever happens to those ugly oil rigs/offshore drilling platforms? Wind isn't sexy, but a wind/battery combo is starting to compete economically & that's a great option to have.

6153 2018-07-16 13:27:34 True but  in the not so distant past, 2013/14 if I'm not wrong crude oil was above $100 per Burrell so is it the byproducts' price rise that's inflated petrol price so much?

6173 2018-07-16 13:25:13 @jeffglor Your comments this morning about your interview of president Trump, you did not consider the substance of his comments about Germany's reliance on Russian oil or gas. He was critical of their commitment with Russia, Pres Reagan warned of such commitments with Russia.

6175 2018-07-16 13:25:04 Agreed. The point being made is that Nigeria’s model ensures the country gets almost nothing (last I checked FG gets about 12-13% total oil revenues). If there had been more forward thinking a better approach would have been sought.

6185 2018-07-16 13:24:11 I have lost all respect for the office of President. I doubt I will ever respect it again. Trump is an old white privledged snake oil salesman and 40% of the country were duped. They just like the crap he says. Fools in my eye.

6414 2018-07-16 13:03:22 Pal, 98% of mineral oil is not 98% of energy consumption. The question remains- what % of overall energy utility is sourced from Russia
25% - renewables
40% - Coal
10%- Nuclear
20%- Gas (of which 60% is Russian sourced and 40% Norwegian) 
5% - other
So roughly 11-12% average. Ok?

6417 2018-07-16 13:02:57 Both criticisms are false: One of the criticisms of peak oil thinking is that it doesn't take into account economic factors. A second criticism is that it fails to recognize so-called unconventional oil resources such as tar sands, tight oil, heavy oil and arctic oil. #PeakOil

6432 2018-07-16 13:01:14 Two countries, Canada and the United States, have been largely responsible for growth in world oil production since 2005. The extra oil came mostly from the tar sands in Canada and the tight oil fields of the United States

What was obvious though was the invasion of Iraq was about securing oil and finishing what Bush Snr started.
6460 2018-07-16 12:59:17 Didn't India vote against Iran on it's nuclear file? During it's 8-year war with Iraq, didn't India support Iraq because a lot of it's oil came fm there.

6479 2018-07-16 12:57:03 This tweet sums up the left pretty well. You have the information of a 10 year old and a very low IQ. It's unbelievable how WRONG and illogical this statement is... 

Reality: Russia is sanctioned, we are the #1 oil producer and Trump just beat the hell out of them. Wake up!
6480 2018-07-16 12:57:00 I totally agree. US and Russia are not enemies, but competitors.They compete against each other in Military Exports and Oil. What you do is good - improving relations bc Western Worlds are full of debt. EcoGrowth is coming from the East& Africa's- China is the main player there.

6490 2018-07-16 12:55:23 For the uninitiated, peak oil in this context refers to the moment in time when the worldwide RATE of oil production reaches a peak and thereafter enters a permanent but possibly bumpy decline. It does NOT, as many wrongly claim, mean the world will run out of oil.
6491 2018-07-16 12:55:19 Bassam, quit living in a closet. We all know what is going on. You trying to single out Horgan and May and others as not trying to stop oil production/exports, just shows how you are drinking the koolaid you are being fed.
6492 2018-07-16 12:55:10 Many things divide the U.S. & Russia, but Trump & Putin are firmly united in their intention to maintain global dominance via oil (& to a lesser degree natural gas).

6501 2018-07-16 12:54:27 lack of investment in oil exploration is likely to show up in two to three years.
investors, however, won't keep subsidizing expensive tight oil extraction for the benefit of the masses indefinitely

6576 2018-07-16 12:46:27 This is literally an attack to slam down any thought of electrification so that oil can cling on to their power and pollution. How the fuck are people defending big oil here is beyond me. So brainwashed its crazy.
6577 2018-07-16 12:46:05 Already done:  derailed the Paris Agreement, increased cost of oil (Russia bread and butter)
6578 2018-07-16 12:45:51 The secrecy, the dishonesty and disrespect by the Tullow Oil Kenya on the EOPS is worth the questioning, investigations and delay of the oil transportation. Why the hurry?
6579 2018-07-16 12:45:49 I love carbs too!! What is it about carbs other than the fact that they do help our body build fuel but that we actually love so much. Like a fresh gooey loaf of Italian bread Parmesan cheese with olive oil and balsamic!!!!! I could eat the entire loaf! Haha i love it.

6581 2018-07-16 12:45:45 Trump admires dictators and calls them strong and smart. He likes the fact that Putin took over the another country in violation of international laws and norms that he himself is blowing up. He said we should have taken Iraqi oil. He hates democractic leaders.

6594 2018-07-16 12:44:09 It's basically a high speed convection oven.  I toss whatever i'm cooking in a little olive oil. Something about the fans is what makes it work.  
It's quick,  easy,  and you get the delicious fried foods with a tiny fraction of the grease.
6595 2018-07-16 12:44:06 Exactly. Americans should also be laying some blame on Putin for the collapse of Venezuela. Putin’s buddy Sechin and his Company Rosneft are entrapping Maduro with loans to prop him up. When they pull the rug out the oil & gas is Putin’s.
6596 2018-07-16 12:44:03 Lmfao yeah he really loves putin killed 200 of putins guys, stacked more NATO troops on russias border, told germany to start paying their 2% gdp in nato and take it out of the 70% of oil they buy from Russia, and he armed the ukranians

6598 2018-07-16 12:43:38 You're correct sir - drilling in USA and the Pipeline has done a wonderful job for the likes of Goldman Sachs & their paper oil trail. When "air" becomes a commodity, invest in windmills and buy it by the pound.

6602 2018-07-16 12:43:10 What else is kinda scary is that we wouldnt be able to run old cars anymore with no fuel/oil since they all require that, so you wouldnt even be able to have nostalgia events or etc unless the cars were converted somehow.

6732 2018-07-16 12:23:47 FYI for those who don't live in Scotland, the Scottish National Party (Nicola Sturgeon) has always advocated for local Scottish control of oil producing territorial waters. The Conservative Party has lead the effort to privatize that oil for British Petroleum. 1/2

6736 2018-07-16 12:23:23 Fantastic Jodi. Perhaps you can read studies that are not by Seralini the ultimate snake oil charmer. Try to read more widely from the real scientific literature which shows the overwhelming benefits of GM crops, new breeding technologies and the environmental win-win.

6744 2018-07-16 12:22:27 Oh the how the old Lib talking points never change. 
Q 1, how much oil did we get from Iraq?
Q 2, before we went into IZ, what did the NIE state in ref to IZ's arsenal, which was the impetus for war?
Q 3, did Congress authorize the use of force in IZ? Did HRC vote for in favor?
6745 2018-07-16 12:22:25 anything is only temporary - i usually leave it, unless it is super painful - then go for sudafed sinus stuff. Olbas Oil can work, but you'll just end up with tissues stuffed up your nose to combat the running.

6768 2018-07-16 12:19:35 The idea that we can affect the necessary infrastructure changes to avoid destruction of large parts of the ecosystem through markets/consumer choice is a pervasive belief, I'm not convinced. Oil is still more money than drinking water, so markets act accordingly...

6791 2018-07-16 12:16:44 I don't like that the other Western hotels are there too. There's enough oil money in that country for them to have made the hotels themselves, and made bookings/stays in Makkah less prohibitively expensive even if they had to subsidise. That's what they should've done.

6853 2018-07-16 12:07:52 Adding subsidized RES, shutting down gas and keeping coal doesn't work. Look at example in Germany vs. UK. As for subsidies, they amount to 3.3bn in Europe for oil & gas (mainly R&D) which return around 420bn in taxation. Challenge to RES economics isn't subsidies to oil & gas...

6969 2018-07-16 11:53:36 I was able to get off meds after decades, with no withdrawals (fear of w/d being partly why it was so many years), by using CBD oil. Don't know if that's something you're knowledgeable about? Its been a Godsend for many.

6977 2018-07-16 11:52:56 Natural gas is one small piece of the energy market. If we are trying to evaluate a countries dependency on another we should look at the whole picture. Oil is an incredibly big part of that.

(put 1 tablespoon of coconut oil in your mouth and swish it around in your mouth for 15-20 minutes, then spit it out in a toilet or a trash can)
- Brush your teeth with baking soda, or with a toothpaste that has baking soda as an ingredient
6986 2018-07-16 11:51:22 if i need you, I'll call you as I don't know how to do that anymore than you know how to dock a ship of oil from Canada in Rotterdam before storing it in Liverpool - virtually all trade is WTO - not just the last hop from EU Rotterdam to UK - we can just miss out Rotterdam

7111 2018-07-16 11:31:30 Any sources to get unfiltered coconut oil?
I have been getting virgin oils regularly from Amazon but I am not sure how pure they are. I wish I could find authentic cold pressed coconut oil.

7113 2018-07-16 11:31:17 America ans the Zionist regime are using their influence to increase pressure on Iran. The problem is that Iran keeps selling crude oil at a very cheap price to Russia and they make huge amount of money .
We must stop thinking today and tomorrow..think about future.. Jobs for us.
7114 2018-07-16 11:31:10 US stock futures are up 0.05% with both Europe and Asia mixed.  Oil is $69.87 and gold is $1,244. Monday is a maybe.

7127 2018-07-16 11:29:27 Putin? POWERFUL? HAH. A willingness to use cut-outs and proxies to achieve his aims and sitting on a metric shit-ton of oil and natural gas does not make Putin powerful, it just makes him aggressive. There’s a lot to be said for aggression, but it doesnt magically make him strong
7128 2018-07-16 11:29:21 So. It's Monday. My wife and I bought a new car this weekend. We hemmed and hawed and finally got a plug in. Mainly bc we don't trust Big Oil. But we also don't trust Donny to fuck things up and piss off  OPEC.

7141 2018-07-16 11:27:58 The irony of France's win is that the French league is weak, dominated by oil money and the players are with foreign clubs.
7142 2018-07-16 11:27:54 My current theory is American traitors working for Russia don’t see it as being traitorous if the money comes from oil and gas. Ditto for the Canadian Trumpists.

Take away oil, no difference.

7234 2018-07-16 11:14:52 clearly as an England bid not a UK bid as none of the other countries appear in this crap video. so the answer is very much NO, & NO to using Government funds, unless of course Scotland is indy by then, then you can do what you like, but you will have no oil money to pay for it

7251 2018-07-16 11:11:44 @tferriss Alternative to coconut oil in Titanium Tea. 

Hey Tim;
I am always looking for products that have a small carbon footprint. I live in Canada and we don't grow coconuts here. Yes, I can get coconut oil, but I would prefer something that is trucked/shipped - suggestions
7252 2018-07-16 11:11:41 In need of sunflower oil and snail cream cuz my legs and arms have lots of dark bruises and wounds 
7253 2018-07-16 11:11:20 Oil prices have gone from $50 per barrel to $75 in the last year. Make savings when you drive electric

7260 2018-07-16 11:10:45 always stir! Stuff that DOESN'T have the oil sitting on top kinda scares me 
7261 2018-07-16 11:10:39 Not sure if Germany depends on a non-allied/non-controlled (by US et al) dominant oil supplier as it does with natural gas and Russia. It's the natural gas market the US tries to dominate in the EU.
7262 2018-07-16 11:10:33 Maybe if Israel were to pay the $1.1 billion+ they legally owe Iran for the 14.75 million cubic meters of crude oil to Israel’s Trans-Asiatic Oil Ltd. The oil they received on credit during the Shah of Iran reign, the money would not accumulate interest in "Zionist banks" abroad!

7331 2018-07-16 10:57:43 We can't afford it either, way too much of our discretionary spending has already gone towards the genocide & only idiots are signing up to serve the oil companies under the guise of protecting "freedom" we don't have in America, everyone else is deployed or dead already.
7332 2018-07-16 10:57:42 Is there any reason why buying, say, 1000 barrels of oil as an investment is a bad idea? Does oil go off?

7666 2018-07-16 09:45:59 Is data the new oil? Yes. In my view, the way oil is extracted has changed.

Now, data is being viewed differently & due care need to be exercised.

7671 2018-07-16 09:44:18 Russia has the GDP analogous to Italy in spite of three times the population. It makes guns, rockets, vodka and pumps oil.

That's it.

Nothing else. It needs to expand because it needs more productive countries to fund it
7672 2018-07-16 09:44:08 That's rich, given the fact that the US armed Saudi Arabia for their Oil, back when u guys were more dependent. Since we share a continent with Russia, we might as well get a long. I agree on the migrant issue though.

Never when Bush et al met Russian leader did we see that spin.Trump confronted Germany for puchasing oil from Russia not USA,sent military equipment to Ukraine. Russia could stand to lose millions if Germany gets USA oil. So that's bromance? NOT

7774 2018-07-16 09:24:18 I don’t agree that we can’t rely on media. I believe that the consequence of the power they weild is that they also gain a social responsibility. The public consciousness and social norms are heavily affected by the media. Just as Shell are responsible for not spilling oil.

7800 2018-07-16 09:17:46 What's the oil? My survival kit looks a lot like yours but I recently also invested in a portable air conditioning unit- it's rather noisy (so I can't have it on all the time) but it's made a huge difference.
7801 2018-07-16 09:17:17 Chief Engr Frank’s boss will be in Lagos to pay me and pick it up today in Ikeja but I have to call the company I’m buying it from and make deposit so oil cochran will not be sold out.

7805 2018-07-16 09:16:53 Your chaotic rhetoric is so stupid and destructive its pathetic and makes one think you may need an oil change !

CHANGE IN NOVEMBER  !

CHANGE IN 2020 !
7806 2018-07-16 09:16:08 Do you think energy will lead, or will OPEC opening up the taps put a lid on oil stocks?
7807 2018-07-16 09:16:05 Chief Engr Frank works with NNPC and he found my number in his diary. He knows I’m God fearing so he wants me to handle a contract. 
NNPC uses a chemical called “oil chochran “ and I’m to supply 100 cartons of it. Each costs 300k.

7810 2018-07-16 09:15:59 Not surprised... There is too much involvement by big business in politics.
I am seeing some Democrat candidates vow to rely on small donations and no oil,petrochemical, drug, etc. company donations.
These are more likely to act in the public interest, we hope...
Less bought.

7843 2018-07-16 09:07:13 .... the impact on the environment and the economic and/or social value of said investment. If this was fracking or onshore oil recovery then it would be a different story. I also think a space port is a better infrastructure to have than Doonray nuclear power station.

8165 2018-07-16 07:50:32 @joshuawakoli that's a good observation, I think it's important that the government registers every Ugandan who is knowledgeable and skilled in oil and gas so that they are brought on board at the opportune moment.

8200 2018-07-16 07:43:41 Oil price increases increase inflation and reduce economic growth... oil prices directly affect the prices of goods made with petroleum products. Increases in oil prices can depress the supply of other goods because they increase the costs of producing them.

8205 2018-07-16 07:42:03 The Standing Rock (Sioux)  reservation is being forced into having an oil pipeline running through its land.

8411 2018-07-16 07:02:55 You are right - wars aren’t as noble as we think, mostly nothing more than a method for the military industrial complex to enrich itself at the expense of innocents who lose their lives at the whims of oil companies. But this is the fault of politicians, not the soldiers.
8412 2018-07-16 07:02:48 Caleb: “What is that?”
Me: “Cuticle oil.”

8453 2018-07-16 06:55:44 It is EXACTLY that, yes. MAGA the lunacy of the statement. Make America Great would be good. Make America Greater would be something anyone on either side of aisle could support. But Make America Great Again? That begs the question of 'like WHEN?' Seriously? 1970s? oil crisis?
8454 2018-07-16 06:55:05 I can’t find my damn oil. I think I left it here at wrk and somebody took it.
8455 2018-07-16 06:54:44 Oil needs to be removed from AGOA before African countries can truly utilize the trade arrangements. Nigeria with so much Agric potential focuses more on Oil trade under the AGOA arrangement, this results in a win for a few people and defeats the purpose.
8456 2018-07-16 06:54:42 Like I said before, in an oil form or gel cap form - CBD only - is the only sane way any true doctor would prescribe it.
8457 2018-07-16 06:54:42 In an earlier issue of the Scientific  American Magazine in an Article titled "In Search for the Best Food" the Middle Eastern food is found to be the most nutritious as it mainly includes olive oil, in addition to nuts etc. Another reason to stick around:)
8458 2018-07-16 06:54:07 The next world war will not be fought over oil. It will be fought over clean drinking water. Those who end up controlling the water will control the world. Clean drinking water will one day become increasingly difficult to find.

8476 2018-07-16 06:49:46 You live in a bubble with no understanding of the evils that control our world... do you have a clue as to how many innocents your government has slaughtered? Pushing political pawns one folded flag at a time, trading blood for oil and control?

- olahraga pagi sore 10 menit aja kardio. 
- makannya raw food ONLY (buah-buahan), kalo gakuat boleh sama telor rebus dan/atau ubi/kentang rebus. pokoknya no oil, salt, sugar. limit kalorinya sampe 300 aja. inget, buah ga zero cal ya.

8486 2018-07-16 06:48:47 i’m Quite Tired after a 12 hour work day and have another one tomorrow, so here’s a feel-good domestic tweet: there’s nothing as comforting and wholesome as having a nice warm mug of hot cocoa w/ a little coconut oil in it after a long day’s work 
8487 2018-07-16 06:48:37 14時間くらい寝てた
8488 2018-07-16 06:48:24 yea, i need more than that.  control of what?  the banks control the coal and oil fields... hoes does false data climate change help the banks make money from their current assets?  depopulation??  why not just use bioweapons ?  your three words "sound" good but lack any depth.

8491 2018-07-16 06:48:06 karena kandungan zaitunnya itu dikit, dan lebih banyak mineral oilnya. Sedangkan mineral oil a.k.a minyak bumi, itu kalau dipakai jangka panjang bisa nyumbat pori. Jadi mendingan jangan ya. Kalo utk bersihin eyemakeup kayak mascara gak papa
8492 2018-07-16 06:47:55 Also...the 75% numbers were a bit high. 

“Natural gas is the fuel where Germany’s proportion of imports from Russia is highest: it’s about 40 percent for crude oil, and about 30 percent for coal.”
8493 2018-07-16 06:47:53 Oooo, I hadn't thought of pencils. One of the  most satisfying things another human has done for me was an ENT nurse putting oil in my ear to relieve itching. My GOD! It was good.

8495 2018-07-16 06:47:18 It's the way Trump criticized Germany for using Russian oil. Trump has also said we should get along with Russia, so he needs to make up his mind.
8496 2018-07-16 06:47:17 that is correct. Trying to convert @adnickens to the center - important in soccer and politics :)

8500 2018-07-16 06:46:12 It has been expressed elsewhere that the OTT TAX should have been introduced as an indirect tax, as part of the final price payable by a customer like it has been done on other commodities like fuel and cooking oil. That way, there wouldn't be the kind of outcry seen today, maybe

8502 2018-07-16 06:45:44 Installers of wind turbines need to deposit sufficient funds into escrow in case they default on fully decommissioning their turbines at end of useful life. We’ve learned from shonky oil operators. As oil companies these days decommission offshore platforms.

Shea butter is good for locking in moisture.
But, For thin or oily hair, shea butter can be heavy and makes hair flat or greasier
And For looser hair texture, shea oil in small portions may be more beneficial

8883 2018-07-16 05:31:55 mom's sick so i became in charge of feeding my fam so yeah, here i am with an aching thumb bc of the cooking oil from frying earlier. 
8884 2018-07-16 05:31:55 Won't happen until both Republicans and Democrats stop taking money from big oil
8885 2018-07-16 05:31:49 Toner, pelembab, facewash, micellar water, cleansing oil, sunscreen
8886 2018-07-16 05:31:47 What does this communist dork and the part of a car engine used to check oil levels have in common? They are both ....
8887 2018-07-16 05:31:46 What can Russia give us? Why do we have to be friends? Twitler wants a building in Russia and part of the oil money from Alaska. That's what "America" gets. Putin gets sanctions lifted, a promise to buy aluminum, drilling in Alaska and world domination. Seems fair.#AmericaGets0
8888 2018-07-16 05:31:40 Oil companies asking the government to expediate the ban of selling new vehicles with internal combustion engines, and giant food-manufacturing companies investing in cellular agriculture. Not the worst timeline!
8889 2018-07-16 05:31:29 Put oil in a skillet... and also dont make those things because heart disease is no joke

8892 2018-07-16 05:31:16 Alaskans own 205,870 shares of HELIX ENERGY SOLUTIONS GROUP I, worth $1,599,610. It's from the OIL SERVICES sector, based in UNITED STATES.
8893 2018-07-16 05:31:06 I hear coconut oil is good for chest sunburns
8894 2018-07-16 05:31:03 I'm sorry you got suckered in by this snake oil salesman.  Before his stop in England 67% of voting British citizens rated pathological L.I.A.R. Trump terrible and 11% rated him good.  Research data shows he is only seen in a positive light in countries that are led by dictators

8896 2018-07-16 05:30:53 One of my biggest pet peeves is the fact that people put actual coconut oil on their hair. It makes me cringe.

8898 2018-07-16 05:29:57 You just paint with your heart. Do you want to use oil, acrylic, or water? If you do paint with oils, ALWAYS USE PAINT THINNER TO RINSE WHEN DONE and I personally use whatever conditioner I have laying around the house on the brushes to keep them soft.

8901 2018-07-16 05:29:45 The world is going thru so much upheaval right now: overpopulation, globalization, the end of the oil age, mass migrations due to war/unrest. People are scared. When ppl are scared they run to tyrants. Fear begets gullibility, violence, loss of compassion/empathy.
8902 2018-07-16 05:29:40 Coconut Oil is such a beautiful thing
8903 2018-07-16 05:29:28 If we are producing extra oil and gas, why are prices rising?  Doesn't make sense why we need OPEC.

8909 2018-07-16 05:28:59 8 13 34 55 are simple averages?

crude oil, yep my model shows same positioning (fwiw)

tide is short, but 2 fastest models allow for rebound which should print a lower high

will reassess there if tide will still be short (likely it will still be)
8910 2018-07-16 05:28:49 oil supply reduce by 0.5-1mb/d, price per barrel rises $8
8911 2018-07-16 05:28:22 Dude I live in spain , when i sleep i wake up sweating like i was in a oil bath
8912 2018-07-16 05:28:09 If you wanna a good laugh, say:
“Rise up lights”
“Whale oil beef hooked”
“Beer can” in a British accent. 
You’re welcome. 
8913 2018-07-16 05:28:08 right now, $2.50 buys 5 cans of pop. A digibyte may buy 5 cans of pop in 2020, but 5 cans of pop are probably going to cost $100-500 dollars by then. The U.S. dollar is not backed by oil any more, countries are using their own currencies, therefore the dollar will hyper-inflate.

8917 2018-07-16 05:27:36 Just got an ad to read an article on biodiversity in Papa New Guinea, sponsored by ExxonMobil. That's nice of them to document all the wildlife there before another one of their oil spills kills all of them.
8918 2018-07-16 05:27:33 That’s an idea.  Maybe I should start taking fish oil
8919 2018-07-16 05:27:25 tht was since u also mentioned oil paintings, may be down the road. As I said for a starter it'd be a rather bad move to charge exorbitant rates tht is until u r a bit established. Doesn't mean u hav to price ultra low... make sure the buyers feel they r getting a gr8 deal !!

- "By that logic you could say someone doesn't care about nature because he just set an oil tanker on fire."
This one is more honest.

8929 2018-07-16 05:24:57 We have stealth bombers and our dollar isn’t based on the price of oil and China is running out of U.S. exports to tariff, are trade imbalance is proof of that.

8933 2018-07-16 05:24:14 We did have a President that met with Raul Castro, a dictator, a murderer, that imprisons dissidents and tortures them.
Then he went to a baseball game, ate hotdogs and did the Wave.

8945 2018-07-16 05:20:53 PICK A FACE WASH

EXFOLIATE  
- my favourite exfoliater is homemade & natural:
2tbsp Honey , 2tbsp Sugar, 1tbsp Olive Oil, this can also be used as a lip scrub

8960 2018-07-16 05:15:58 Let me guess!

All Presidents play for big oil companies, mining, and the #PetroDollar! And it always helps when you can sign a Free Trade Agreement to lower worker wages and undermine national sovereignty.

How many wars were not for oil, resources, nor the #PetroDollar?

9021 2018-07-16 05:02:51 It only raised the excise tax, products with negative externalities such as oil by 2.50 pesos and SSB by 6-12 pesos depending on the product. Further increases are caused by other external factors such as the weak currency and high oil prices

9024 2018-07-16 05:01:44 @NitishKumar one of the reasons why those who are jailed under liquor prohibition belong mostly to dalits is they don't have godfathers in police and the administration, and not because they drink more. They don't hv money either to oil police's hand.

9035 2018-07-16 04:58:48 Look into the Merkel and Russions Oil deal, you would be suprised,  President Trump was more than respectful  to her in public,  all about her personal gains, not NATO, not her own country

His actions have been stronger against Putin.  Clinton got our IT workers involved in Skolkovo.

9044 2018-07-16 04:56:38 Well, Congress did but the early busted companies weren't exactly monopolies if I remember correctly. Standard oil had something like 20% market share when it got busted.

9060 2018-07-16 04:54:10 Might be.  It's Big Oil on Overkill, but you have to get every prototype out.
9061 2018-07-16 04:54:10 Russian main exports are energy (oil and petroleum products, gas, coal), rolled steel, ferrous  and nonferrous metals and minerals. Other leading exports are natural gas, timber, fertilizers, machinery and equipment, armaments.

9062 2018-07-16 04:54:00 Strangest thing about colour blindness is it's not ust a sensory problem but has perceptual component also. Once in art class, I painted a still life of a chrome tap.

9066 2018-07-16 04:53:23 I’ve been taking @NaturesUltra CBD oil for sleep. Been taking for 4 months now and started sleeping better after 2 weeks of daily use. Would def recommend if trying to get better sleep.
9067 2018-07-16 04:53:13 For 80 years the world has been scared of Germany building a strong army again and told them thy don’t need one. Hence US troops still being stationed in Germany! 
Also, German deals with other countries are none if Trump’s business. He’s just angry he can’t sell American oil
9068 2018-07-16 04:53:04 My boyfriend and I make our own with just baking soda, coconut oil, tea tree and peppermint oil. It’s amazing for sensitive skin. It can also be used as a natural toothpaste

9088 2018-07-16 04:49:37 PTFEですとドライ潤滑スプレーが身近に流通しているので一般用途だとそっちの方が良いですかね。PTFEは馴染みが悪いので粉末そのままだと使い勝手が。スプレーなら満遍なく付きますし、定着剤が含まれている場合はそれなりに耐久性も。黒鉛は擦り込みでそれなりに付着するんですが。難しい所ですね。

9091 2018-07-16 04:49:07 First off the U.S. is the worlds largest producer of oil so we do not get most of our oil from Canada, we produce it ourselves. Most of the oil we import we do get from Canada. 
2nd our Trade Deal with the EU is to insure NATO is with us in nations like Afghanistan, Iraq, & Syria

9098 2018-07-16 04:47:33 just found my edible massage oil while cleaning my room, now I’m having flashbacks where’s my man
9099 2018-07-16 04:47:30 is it work ? i mean tar oil ? i just buy it now they said alot of things good about it so im trying to know of its work ?
9100 2018-07-16 04:47:27 Black castor oil really does make your eyelashes and eyebrows grow. I honestly didn’t think it would work
9101 2018-07-16 04:47:27 Oh a great little nighttime trick if you have a hard time relaxing before bed.... apply small dabs of lavender oil on the cheeckbones.... heated face mask or a warm wash clothe over the eyes ... 3-5 min deep breathing exercises.... it’s life changing .. thank me later 
9102 2018-07-16 04:47:19 ...and @exxonmobil 's former CEO, Lee Raymond might argue something like this: you need to get that electricity from somewhere... #ElectricVehicle #oil

9106 2018-07-16 04:45:23 You have to be honest with Big Oil but still let them down easy. Hard to pull off.
9107 2018-07-16 04:45:14 My legs got destroyed by mosquitos last night.... this peppermint oil is helping with the itchiness

9109 2018-07-16 04:45:02 Uhhhh yeah speaking as a farm girl the cowboy hat has *nothing* to do with oil and gas. You don't have to "earn the right" to wear that hat, don't conflate farmers/ranchers with oil. Everyone is welcome to wear a cowboy hat. 
9110 2018-07-16 04:44:56 President Trump has shown us how Germany is fueling Russia ' s war machine. Member of NATO, really? Pay for their oil, infrastructure, how dare you. WE Brought down the wall, and now in good fashion you sneak around. Can't  wait to see. Holocaust in Syria?  Merkel

9113 2018-07-16 04:44:15 “You know the smell of like day old broccoli rabe that was cooked in oil.... that is the vibe”
9114 2018-07-16 04:44:06 Two words: coconut oil.
9115 2018-07-16 04:43:37 Lol Nawh get sum new tired and a oil change
9116 2018-07-16 04:43:36 Oh and PSA: almost all of ethnic hair care at Walgreens is 30% off rn! Includes Shea moisture, cantu, olive oil, mixed chicks, some different types of hair gels, etc!
9117 2018-07-16 04:43:16 I started oil pulling a few months ago and it made a huge difference in the whiteness of my teeth
9118 2018-07-16 04:43:03 No, it exposed an American president trying to broker deals for American oil and gas companies with personal ties to himself 
But Germany and other NATO partners just got reminded how untrustworthy Trump is, they’ll think twice before they make deals with the orange bully 
9119 2018-07-16 04:42:53 Why does a cowboy's hat represent oil and gas? Pretty sure health & safety insists on hard hats for those guys.
Don't preach like you're a man of the people. You used to earn more in a week than most Canadians earn in a year, and all you did was play a bloody game.
9120 2018-07-16 04:42:53 Where’s my oil 
9121 2018-07-16 04:42:36 I'm the oil field and you're the United States. :P
9122 2018-07-16 04:42:34 The most glaring and bold revelation by Trump is Germany taking NATO funds for its mutual defence against Russian on the one hand and on the other supports Russia with its oil pipeline terminating at Germany
9123 2018-07-16 04:42:29 And China wants to unhook oil from the $. If that happens, we are toast. Our money is hooked to oil, if China gets the yuan to be currency for oil, our money will inflate like never seen before. China is the power trying to make this happen.

9154 2018-07-16 04:38:54 I’ve worked in oil and gas most of my life. Don’t wear a hat. Not even during Stampede. My grandpa wore a cowboy hat every day. Working on his farm.
9155 2018-07-16 04:38:45 なんこれ
9156 2018-07-16 04:38:20 In today's world Dollar carries lots of value.USA,like all other countries,needs plenty of Dollars and Donald J Trump is working unabashedly for that.If he succeeds in that,he will be a reasonably good POTUS,no doubt about it.Manners, expected from others,have gone to fetch oil.
9157 2018-07-16 04:38:04 About as relevant as John McCain. 
His policies partially responsible for the shape we are in now. Prior to Obama, Democrats were pro strong borders /anti illegal immigration. Bush amnesty was a no go.

9159 2018-07-16 04:37:57 No complaints.  Got the tip from a sis to make it smooth going down.  Now, the oil is looked for.  Not everyone gets this treatment.  Plus, the taste of coconut.

Are you aware of US actions in Nicaragua and other regions to prevent nationalization of oil revenues?

9169 2018-07-16 04:36:34 IMHO Obama sanctioned the crap out of them for Crimea and drove the price of oil down with fracking. Oil prices are on the rise due to Iran and general instability. And Putin wants those sanctions lifted. This meeting is the first step to that.

9182 2018-07-16 04:34:42 Put some essential oil inside of a cardboard toilet paper tube. The pleasurable scent will be released whenever the toilet paper is used.
9183 2018-07-16 04:34:39 That’s not ominous at all. Nope not even a oil bit
9184 2018-07-16 04:34:38 Let’s stop listening to pseudo-intellectuals. Like right now. The best of us should lead us. We shouldn’t follow those who pretend to be intelligent. They’re just selling snake oil.

9193 2018-07-16 04:33:38 Yes it does :) lavender essential oil does as well! I make my sons baby wash because I don’t trust some of the ingredients put into the ones at the store. To each their own, though  I’m sure the lavender wash works great.

Pineapple is pretty good on pizza
Coffee is better than tea

Coconut oil isn’t skincare

9210 2018-07-16 04:31:11 There's more to this though--Trump had a second rate web developer running his analytics along with a grifting company selling snake oil in Cambridge Analytics--the Clinton data may have been far better than anything they had.

9228 2018-07-16 04:28:33 Agreed. Putting faith in unproved poppycock is dangerous. Most of the time it may mean you're susceptible to con artists selling you snake oil. However, sometimes faith in delusions can lead to pain and suffering, not just belief that pain & suffering are ok.

9232 2018-07-16 04:27:27 I don’t believe a person’s eschatology is inconsequential or easily abandoned if it proves to be wrong. The foolish virgins start with oil, but they start to run out around midnight and it’s too late to remedy.
9233 2018-07-16 04:27:26 It wasn't a good weekend for me, but it's ok. I bounce back pretty fast. First, when I got my oil changed, the mechanics noticed a big metal pipe that connects to my wheel had come off due to a bolt that had come off of it. I could have had a roll over on the highway.

9308 2018-07-16 04:12:23 1st of all, I'm just using this site to express my opinion. I don't car if I have ANY followers!  2nd, you should eat more fish or take Fish Oil supplements, if you think that if Trump mfd in the US, he would save ANY factories. He's a businessman who uses the system to profit.
9309 2018-07-16 04:12:22 Oh fk off..
9310 2018-07-16 04:12:15 Take care when #cooking
More than half of accidental fires in the home start because of something to do with cooking

Take extra care when cooking with hot oil and don’t leave children alone in the kitchen when the hob or oven is on
9311 2018-07-16 04:12:07 Yeah I’m sure they are. But you know one thing they aren’t bad in - the oil thing!
9312 2018-07-16 04:11:23 Haters will hate... sweat and oil don’t make me lol leave me alone
9313 2018-07-16 04:11:21 I thought I'd gotten it all when I deleted the Pinterest boards and the savings goal for a trip we were supposed to take together.

One of worst things was new lingerie I got the week before he left. And the massage oil I bought for us we never opened. And the custom made toys.
9314 2018-07-16 04:11:21 I hate pumping gas, putting air in my tires, oil changes, paying for shit, inspections, registration stickers, & all the rest of the shit that comes with cars. I just wanna drive the car barely even that ugh just don’t even want a damn car 
9315 2018-07-16 04:11:20 I prefer adding peanut butter to have gone ahead and that's the bloody oil the rest

9318 2018-07-16 04:11:12 Oh man. The Ukrainian oil exploration loan I'm trying to sell has been such a crushing defeat. You're gonna have to play without me.
9319 2018-07-16 04:11:11 If oil comes from dinosaurs and plastic comes from oil. Plastic dinosaurs are made of real dinosaurs.
9320 2018-07-16 04:11:11 I now live by coconut oil. If your skin is dry mix it with a regular lotion and your skin is soft as hell. If your hair is dry or want to has softer hair, put a quarter amount melted on the ends of your hair. Fucking magic 
9321 2018-07-16 04:11:08 Hilarious, Us military under Trump killed how many Russian soldiers in Syria. Angry at Germany for buying Russian oil/gas, "being held captive by Russia" I guess Kaius was off on a sabbatical at the time.

Her dark eyes flashed knowingly, “Something wrong?” She challenged.
“Yes, this is terrible, how can you eat this crap?”

9333 2018-07-16 04:08:36 Easy is the "One on One" They already know the payoff, it's just how to ease it to the public and Trump will be his front man in all places Putin isn't . G=8 Doing more than Oil business to UK and Euro. Once hooked take what Russia want's ? More countries with no intervention.
9334 2018-07-16 04:08:16 Under some circumstances, you may be able destroy oil outright rather than interfere with its effectiveness, by removing stoppers from lubricating systems or by puncturing the drums and cans in which it is stored.
9335 2018-07-16 04:08:13 it came from putin and his people or oil tychoons in Russia where and who else has that amount of $ hanging around

9338 2018-07-16 04:07:21 Russia has no economic power, it's not producing enough, and enough customers to buy. Aside from GAS&OIL. Countries are moving to Green energy, that's detrimental to #Russian GAS&OIL economy. Let alone, Russian rupiles is not even been traded on the world market.

9342 2018-07-16 04:05:46 Kind of odd isnt it that Obama and Hillary sold our uranium to Russia and now Germany is going to purchase natural gas and oil from Russia. And politicians call for sanctions against Russia. What are the missing link(s) that bind all this together
9343 2018-07-16 04:05:37 Oil that goddess down!
9344 2018-07-16 04:05:34 Putin still needs help to keep oil and gas prices up. Trump blew up the Iran deal for him, but he needs more.
9345 2018-07-16 04:05:18 Hey, can I have some oil, dis bitch is thirsty
9346 2018-07-16 04:05:08 That's terrifying...that happened to me when I was 18 they didn't close the good all the way after a oil change and it didnt fly up until I was on the highway I thought I was gonna die for sure.

9353 2018-07-16 04:02:56 President Obama's deal with Iran was a pretty good deal. There were some issues with it. But everyone was in compliance. And it helped balance the world oil trade. Gas prices were pretty low. A hell of a lot better than Trump's deal with North Korea. There is no deal. Lol
9354 2018-07-16 04:02:55 Nope.
Just mint leaves & patchouli oil.

9365 2018-07-16 04:01:38 Gandhi's are champions of dividing people by caste and religion to create vote banks. Also they are known to create beggars by giving freebies rice, oil etc instead of educating and creating jobs. They want to create slaves out of indians always so that pappus can govern.
9366 2018-07-16 04:01:25 I put thieves oil on my huge gash I have on my foot and it’s been burning sooo bad for like 20 minutes

9369 2018-07-16 04:00:49 The financial backers of Islamic terror (i.e. mostly Saudi Arabia) get special breaks and honors from the president and Congress. The only Islamic targets of serious Treasury aggression are the ones that won't sell us their oil.

9378 2018-07-16 04:00:04 @jerseymikes Please tell your employees  to stop putting sides of oil and vinegar at the bottom of your paper bags. Because they don't stay shut and I'm tired of getting home with a bag dripping in oil covering everything except my sandwich.
9379 2018-07-16 04:00:02 People from slums can't afford to go to ME,its mostly the people who can. Nations that can't produce a grain of rice without oil they will be begging for food, just like other countries with the similar religious orientation.
9380 2018-07-16 03:59:44 My skin loves the @Biossance squalane + vitamin C Rose oil. (I got a free sample) With everything going on over the next month though, I can't even afford it till almost September.

9387 2018-07-16 03:59:00 US imports more than twice the amount of oil it makes on its own. So still needing other countries.

9391 2018-07-16 03:57:59 Alright, so I’ve been moisturizing with Shea Butter and a drop of lemon essential oil. So tbh I’m not sure if it’s the aloe or the lemon essential oil but I have seen improvement in my dark spots.

9395 2018-07-16 03:56:35 It's going to be so much worse than you think.   And it's all an orchestrated lie designed to sell oil.
9396 2018-07-16 03:56:31 This is true.  They do.  And solar farms are imperfect.  But destroying the boreal forest to extract tar sands oil is far more damaging to wildlife and on a greater scale. Continued use of fossil fuels will only hasten the climate crisis already upon us.  Respectfully.

9398 2018-07-16 03:55:39 I would love to see these people list his accomplishments. Things he did. 

And as a hint things like taking credit for increased domestic oil and natural gas production doesn’t count since it happened DESPITEyou and not because of you
9399 2018-07-16 03:55:35 And they did it so that they could pack the courts with right wing crackpot judges, steal SCOTUS seats, and tear down all of the democratic progress America has made over the last 60 years. In return, Putin gets sanctions lifted for his Crimea invasion for billions in oil money.

9405 2018-07-16 03:54:12 The only reason they go there is because these few countries have oil money. Moment that's gone they will come back faster than they left.

9413 2018-07-16 03:52:54 Oh. My apologies. I didn’t realize that caring about the sake of our environment (you know...which kinda affects us all) and making sure the Gulf Coast doesn’t suffer an oil spill was considered a “freebie.”
9414 2018-07-16 03:52:38 I had awful cystic acne for yearssss. The three products that saved me were the dark angels scrub from Lush, witch hazel toner, and using 100% Rose hip oil as a daily moisturizer! They’re the only products I have consistently stuck with
9415 2018-07-16 03:51:58 Watch me get funding for a mission to #Kepler186F "There's oil and gold there."
9416 2018-07-16 03:51:42 Join the ranks. I dumped the Republican Party back when Dubya was busy outting American CIA agents because he was in a huff, and killing off 4500 American kids on a wild Cheney chase for oil. 

Both parties have become paralyzed with greed and indifference.
9417 2018-07-16 03:51:15 But then, you’re not black and living in America; you’re not Mexican, working the fields; you’re not a woman whose reproductive rights are threatened; you’re not a Native American marginalised for oil; you’re not gay. You’re ‘elite’ white Christian, of course you can’t see it.
9418 2018-07-16 03:50:43 He also told multiple countries to not buy gas and oil from Russia, but he definitely wants Russia to thrive over the EU.

9421 2018-07-16 03:49:50 Breaking: According to Iranian press reports, Trump before his meeting with Putin has said the US won't buy oil from #Iran, but isn't against other states buying Iranian oil. 

He's also reportedly said he isn't against Boeing sale to Iran & the sale hasn't been cancelled.
9422 2018-07-16 03:49:17 Hillary brought our IT companies to Russia (Skolkovo), the Obama Administration gave Russia access to 20 % of our Uranium, Trump got our NATO allies to increase their contributions by 266 billion per the Sec. General and asked ourcallies to quit supporting his with oil purchases
9423 2018-07-16 03:49:13 オイル、君なら地球を救える。
9424 2018-07-16 03:49:11 2)It will hurt EU,but then,Iran is only a small market.

It is Iran's fuel supplies that it seeks,supposedly&deludedly assumed that it wud be cheaper. Iran had LONG been calling for reduced supplies to make oil more expensive.
9425 2018-07-16 03:48:57 good grief!!  Theo must have been one busy boy, chasing tourists and (non ranching) locals alike around and goading them to get those oil and gas emblems off their heads... Stampede be damned.  No hats unless oil, gas or ranch.  Got it.

9442 2018-07-16 03:46:04 Oh yes he really is trying to please him.  Which, by getting NATO to increase spending or asking Germany and the EU to quit buying so much oil and  Natural gas from Russia, or the many other things he has done in the interest of the U.S.

9445 2018-07-16 03:45:14 Ideals our politicians follow are petty parody of greed for money & power. Nothing much, nothing less. Evident they are feeding on ignorance of uneducated & poor. Snake oil sellers don't last, but we've got lots. Nepal needs #education to rid of this pests & #soonWewill together
9446 2018-07-16 03:45:03 Having worked in multiple commodities over 20+ years none can claim their entire industry is sustainable. I don't see calls for absolute proof ALL cocoa or ALL beef is sustainble. Progress is happening in palm oil and that should be encouraged

9455 2018-07-16 03:43:59 I was planning on more oil next time. Problem is I need a bunch of flour to roll it out properly as I am but a mere apprentice breader.

9462 2018-07-16 03:43:00 This to be followed with a national campaign to identify and register all non complying entities. Since oil is a major consumable item, give incentive in new tax policy to the import/mfr of electric cars,  solar and desalination technology to lower imports. 3/3

9477 2018-07-16 03:39:56 1. Proofed the yeast
2. Added sugar and salt, olive oil (2 tsp), oregano.
3. All purpose flour until dough was no longer sopping wet (roughly 2.5 cups)
Leave to rise, then knead it out and add some more flour so that I can roll it on the pan.

My concern is too much flour.
9478 2018-07-16 03:39:34 The oil companies there are required to fund research. It is .....odd?
9479 2018-07-16 03:39:22 That's fine, but all these busts ,what I would like to know is why doesn't all this marijuana go to making this oil for the sick , marijuana comes from a seed its to help the sick yet tabacco is legal & causes cancer but that's not banned and marijuana is banned & illegal

9484 2018-07-16 03:38:48 Well, at least here in Washington state, you bought gas at a service station. Someone pumped the gas for you, checked your oil and the air in your tires. They put air in your tires for free. Also, they washed your windshield.
9485 2018-07-16 03:38:35 Cuma pake face oil
9486 2018-07-16 03:38:28 Peppermint oil is good as a repellent and also kill them or make them release if bitten. It also appears to reduce the severity of the bite. I mean jic anyone would prefer an alternative method.

9488 2018-07-16 03:38:07 Overheard at dinner “I heard you have food poisoning. I checked my oily stash, but I don’t have an oil for that!”

Is there an oil to make sure I don’t have to hear the word ‘oily stash’ ever again?  #NoTerra
9489 2018-07-16 03:37:53 If I remember correctly, he managed to get oil money to fund his research. Not nearly as smarmy as his treatment of women. Could even be viewed as quite clever. Unfortunately, the rest of his conduct doesn't inspire any of us.
9490 2018-07-16 03:37:47 Hot oil packets, you can get them from King Soopers or Walmart
9491 2018-07-16 03:37:33 Sunday night showers are so uplifting and energizing because I head to toe dry brush then head to toe coffee scrub. I recently added peppermint essential oil to my coffee scrub and oh my god it’s lovely.
9492 2018-07-16 03:37:29 The real question is would my hair be this juicy if my MI hadn’t kicked in and kept me from washing out all that oil in a reasonable amount of time?
9493 2018-07-16 03:37:21 The article said oil mining.....

9526 2018-07-16 03:31:56 I would if Trump wasn't goading OPEC into turning the spigots wide open, lol. We'll be back to having more oil sitting in tankers than we have refining capacity (which is its own problem).
9527 2018-07-16 03:31:52 The kind of oil we export is the verity that we have excess of and it’s not used for diesel.

The oil we export is used primarily for plastics.  

Actually the tar sand oil of CA is best for plastic.  

Exports are good for all Americans if it’s fair trade.
9528 2018-07-16 03:31:47 The key to giving a great massage is the right amount of baby oil & good hand strength
9529 2018-07-16 03:31:11 Dana @DanaPerino has a hair problem. I think washing the used motor oil out of it might help.  Cutting it definitely would.  I used to be in love with her but I'm not anymore.

9532 2018-07-16 03:30:57 The Steele Dossier stated Putin would pay Trump 19% of ROSNEFT, Russia’s state owned oil company if he became president and removed US sanctions. After the election, 19% of ROSNEFT was sold to an ‘unknown party’ via a forgivable loan from the VTB through a Cayman Island shell co.

9577 2018-07-16 03:23:27 Oil, drugs, arms will always be a very asymmetrically demand side market tendency. Trickle down supply side restrictions is mostly futile.
9578 2018-07-16 03:23:21 Oil prices fell on Monday as concerns about supply disruptions eased and Libyan ports resumed export activities, while traders eyed potential supply increases by Russia and other oil producers.

9582 2018-07-16 03:22:52 WANT to make that cow liver taste better when you fry it?  Try frying a piece of bacon first and then once its cooked  remove then place your Liver in that oil and fry. Also grill some white onion and put on top once liver cooked. Liver is one of the cheapest meats you could buy.
9583 2018-07-16 03:22:45 I really....REALLY hope you mean wiping it down....otherwise, you're way kinkier than I ever thought.  I've just had way better results with cleaning and wiping it before I cook.  For some reason if I oil it after I cook and don't cook for a while I get that rancid oil smell.

9596 2018-07-16 03:21:06 Russia's economy is heavily dependent on oil and natural gas. Trump helped to raise prices for Russia by ending the Iran treaty. 

The lower oil and gas prices go, the worse it is for Russia.

Most still view it as an oil producer instead of an oil Realestate play which is what it is
9622 2018-07-16 03:18:09 It was my first attempt, but I learned what I gotta do, I couldn’t taste the oil, I needed it to do a roax but it disnt deter it from being slimy. I had to slowly cook it and add vegetable stock to get rid of it.

9711 2018-07-16 03:08:00 For silky hair, mix 3 parts olive oil and 1 part honey. Put in microwave 30 sec. Apply to damp hair 20 mins with shower cap on. Rinse well!
9712 2018-07-16 03:07:55 Check their oil consumption from Russia lol
9713 2018-07-16 03:07:49 I’m going to say this right now no one knows s___t as to where oil ES is going it’s all a guess until it starts to go. So everyone predicting on Twitter is fos. It’s not a bad thing it’s just a fact, because they, we just don’t know.

9716 2018-07-16 03:07:27 Yes, even worse than oil. Essentially, Venezuelan non oil economy (never anything to write home about) has devolved into sub-subsistence level.
9717 2018-07-16 03:07:23 It’s actually unreal how some guys pass themselves off as Oilers fans… everything that comes from them is about shitting on the team… It’s ridiculous… Smells like a Nest of flames trolls

9720 2018-07-16 03:07:13 exfoliate your lips. put a drop of olive oil in your palm and then sprinkle granulated sugar over it until it’s the consistency of a lip exfoliant. after that (this parts important) what you’re gonna wanna do is rub it on your lips. the sugar exfoliates while the oil moisturizes.

9730 2018-07-16 03:05:58 I never regretted removing toxic ppl in my life. No more oil in mah ocean 
9731 2018-07-16 03:05:28 There is no addiction by ordinary Australian families to own their home which is a necessity. The binge has come from money printing in the US and elsewhere to keep economy alive after 2008 oil price shock and during high oil price period until 2014. Plus many rich immigrants
9732 2018-07-16 03:05:04 Yep, because he'd be a lame duck president and not have to worry about reelection.

What a snake oil salesman.
9733 2018-07-16 03:04:57 Ex-fuckin-actly. Not only are they expenisve, they are chemically addicting, loaded with harmful side-effects, and debilitating. Opiods kill more people than save. And yet giving a young child with epileptic seizures a drip of cannabis oil is “taboo.”

9736 2018-07-16 03:04:29 1) PMJT doesn't buy oil, that would be CDN refineries 2) Crude oil is bought on price, not morality (whether you like or not) 3) CERI recently estimated that 47% of foreign oil (all the non-USA supply) could be economically replaced with CDN oil w/no new pipelines.

9738 2018-07-16 03:04:16 Let's not forget that unsuccessful, weird, incident with the mercs sent by Putin's close friend to take a U.S. held post in Syria in hopes of securing some oil fields. Something fishy about that whole incident.
9739 2018-07-16 03:04:15 Trump has no choice, but to meet with putin because Putin demanded the meeting. He wants a progress report about his investment. Trump supposed to lift all sanctions vs Russia and deliver the $500 billion dollars oil deal after Putin helped him win the election.

9781 2018-07-16 02:58:47 if you told 13 year old me that i'd still be burning the midnight oil listening to kelly clarkson's album and playing the sims at age 23 she'd be so sad but that's just the way things are sometimes

9819 2018-07-16 02:51:49 Trump is pissed about Germany propping up the economy of Russia & expec the U.S. to be its protector, which we are, at billions of $$ a year. Germany can cough up a little more $$ for their oil & gas from an ally or cough up a whole hell of a lot more for their defense. Choose!

9838 2018-07-16 02:48:09 Girl! It’s been 7 years straight of a migraine in this house. My go-to is ice on my head when it’s flaring. I cannot use peppermint or lavender oil, but I know a lot of people do. I also try to put on soft music that I’m use to (Taylor) to try to distract myself from the pain.
9839 2018-07-16 02:47:58 I bought some CBD oil for Louie for the next time there’s fireworks.
9840 2018-07-16 02:47:20 The key is room temp, as little air as possible, dark. Or make an oil, tincture or butter. Something more storable.

9842 2018-07-16 02:47:14 "How odd that these apes would battle over oil when they have ENTIRE OCEANS OF PURE SALT WATER JUST BEGGING TO BE TAKEN!

9843 2018-07-16 02:47:10 I read that article earlier, still doesn’t explain why he went off on a reporter other then trying to act like an assignment editor. He’s the one that walked away, turned around and swore at a reporter. Own it. Don’t say it if you don’t want it reported. End of story for me.

9847 2018-07-16 02:46:39 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.

9852 2018-07-16 02:46:04 sorry, I generally see "gfy" used in context of snake oil, hogwash and junk science.
9853 2018-07-16 02:45:56 but how the fuck did they figure out what oil does. who tapped that foul ooze from the earth and decided to burn it that would not have been my instinct
9854 2018-07-16 02:45:44 Keep in mind DaddyBear that we "may" get some news from the Trump/Putin summit that Russia will be INCREASING crude oil production to "help the global economy out"....

9855 2018-07-16 02:45:35 At an awkward point in life when I need to ask the people I really trust: “When, exactly, did you first notice that I’d started smelling like gear oil, and why didn’t you say anything?”
9856 2018-07-16 02:45:34 Home from work and purchased zucchini/summer squash noodles and cooked them in olive oil, garlic. Added fresh shaved Parmesan cheese and cherry tomatoes. Give it a try! Fresh summertime, light, pasta dish.

9867 2018-07-16 02:43:12 I appreciate raising awareness. The article you posted was about replacing one oil with another which I say is like exchanging dirty underpants. And whole grain is not technically “carb” because it is also protein fiber and nutrient rich. IMHO we need to eschew the word “carb”.

9871 2018-07-16 02:42:37 Just ran out of my absolute favorite facial oil and I forgot how much it costed, so I looked it up and it’s literally $105 what the hell was I thinking?! But I have mental issues so I’m going straight to sephora to buy another bottle when I get my next paycheck sis.
9872 2018-07-16 02:42:37 You do understand Trump is pushing on the EU to stop buying energy from Russia, which in turns means that the Russians will lose tens of billions in oil and gas revenue.
9873 2018-07-16 02:42:37 Greek pasta salad - shells with feta, kalamata olives, tomatoes and chickpeas. Dressing is olive oil, red wine vinegar and dill and oregano + salt and pepper.
9874 2018-07-16 02:42:25 I agree with everyone of your tweets in thread but this one. America is in a position of strength, however where I disagree with Trump is there is nothing Ru can/will do for US. YOU, need to support US/NATO base in Poland, more lethal arms Ukr, & Sanctions on Ru Oil/Gas like Iran
9875 2018-07-16 02:42:23 What kind of logic is that ? For more than a 100 years they call it rapeseed oil now it's canola oil and I was never raped. old name never offended me once. But someone was so now I call it canola oil. Evolve

9877 2018-07-16 02:41:46 Koch brothers are paying them... they've been the traitors of democracy since the 1980's. Their father made his fortune building refineries in Russia. He helped build Nazi oil refineries... Fred Koch and Fred Trump both passed their wealth to their children... Trust fund babies!
9878 2018-07-16 02:41:46 ill never go back to sipping oil lol , dat shit is addicting.
9879 2018-07-16 02:41:42 Ms. Notley could have done more but I guess with an entrenched PC bureaucracy and the oil industry pulling the strings she had a tough farm field to hoe. I'm guessing she will be out and then we're all stuck with #TrumpWannabes for the next little while. AB changing but not fast.

9884 2018-07-16 02:40:50 Trump is not willing to challenge Germany to stop buying Russian oil ... he just wants to make more money for Military Industrial Complex.  Trump may be the biggest fool ever.

9893 2018-07-16 02:39:15 Oily gets off sticky (canola or olive oil, depending on where the sap is), soapy gets off oily (which could be more challenging for a phone). Goo gone is pretty good stuff too though.
9894 2018-07-16 02:39:12 It's much easier to determine value in  a stock, building, or house under current market conditions.

9912 2018-07-16 02:35:11 So far, the government has managed to isolate oil infrastructure from protestors. Also, moved special forces to guard oil fields. I reckon there will not be an impact on exports as long as oil workers keep conducting their duties. #OOTT

9968 2018-07-16 02:27:13 Use oil, olive, canola, mineral oil to get it off. The oil makes it ball up and easier to remove. Just apply liberally and massage it in. It should become easier to take it off. 

If you have an old wash cloth, use it instead of tissue.

Obama didn't approve the Keystone pipeline.

Do your research...
9979 2018-07-16 02:23:56 This is just the start. Trump has started a trade war he has no control over. The middle East still controls a lot of the world trade because of their oil. Guess who will get costly fuel if their economy is hit?
