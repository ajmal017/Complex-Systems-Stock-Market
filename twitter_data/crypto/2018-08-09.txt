0 2018-08-09 23:59:54 I am doing my best. but on the one hand it really looks great! partnership, community, development. But on the other hand - I see rough blunders that cut eyes. But you must agree - the main objective indicator is the price! Is not it?

2 2018-08-09 23:59:21 Everyone dump bitconnect and let these youtube promoters buy and hold these useless scam coins. Let's show the crypto world what we think about them and the biggest crypto ponzi bitconnect ! #bitconnectx

4 2018-08-09 23:58:56 @teddycleps hey what's up Crypto Freek. I wish I understood trading and TA, but I have no clue. I try not to buy high or sell when I'm low. I'm no crypto expert but I know what I like

5 2018-08-09 23:58:54 Hey @crypto_bobby , how would you guys survived such a long bear market? I am getting impatient now. Losing money every day. As I got in Nov2017. Don't know how to get through this. Still #HODL
6 2018-08-09 23:58:31 Also, if we can get enough people to jump on the StellarX bandwagon, it could drastically change crypto trading. IMHO the Stellar native DEX is the best crypto trading experience, especially with a Ledger. Not to mention completely free.
7 2018-08-09 23:58:31 Okay I don’t think you realize we are so early in crypto. It’s a puddle you can make big splashes. When it turns into an ocean you will see! Adoption will happen. And in one year we can see the progress. 2019 will be huge and 2020 even bigger. Trust! If you don’t believe then

9 2018-08-09 23:58:15 Always check the news of your #crypto. Make sure you know what is going on, what the CEO is doing, how they are managing their funds, and that they are meeting checkpoints on their roadmap. Staying up to date is imperative.

Don't trade on news. #hodl and sell off company merit
10 2018-08-09 23:58:11 Going crypto full time -> build - but what? and why? 
Does a world need another ERC20 token? 

How about building something actually useful and then buying bitcoin from revenue?
11 2018-08-09 23:58:06 Waw is this you place now?

積立してそれが下がり続けたらそれナンピンだから勘違いするなよ
