53 2018-01-14 20:00:31 It's definitely a strange world. I wish the boys were better educated on these things too. It's a two way street but I feel like that narrow window of female empowerment I was brought up with died w/o our noticing and women were socialized as passive sexual commodities again.
54 2018-01-14 19:56:32 I hope you'll do something about the escalating prices of almost all basic commodities!!!
55 2018-01-14 19:53:26 One way for it all to work out is by inflating away the problem or decaying USD. If so then:

Wages rise
Real estate rises
Markets rise
Commodities rise
Rates can go higher
Global deleveraging
China buys our exports
China finds use for USD

Shh! Don’t tell bonds investors! :)

60 2018-01-14 18:57:52 I think the problem is that sometimes fans  see athletes as commodities rather than people (Im guilty of this sometimes). Writers/reporters actually interact with these guys so you have a better perspective.
61 2018-01-14 18:37:38 Ué, já tá elogiando o Lula? Vota nele.

A “marolinha” do Lula se deveu a dois fatores ALHEIOS a ele: China crescendo a 2 dígitos e demandando commodities; Preservar o tripé econômico, política do FHC, a quem ele demonizava.
62 2018-01-14 18:27:59 I'd take Fournier. Jazz don't more guys to develop. They need known commodities ready to support Mitchell and Gobert.
63 2018-01-14 18:20:12 Is there any need for criptocurrency? Dollar is weakining and all the commodities are rising. Also the most important thing, cryptocurrencies are sliding because they are sold in dollars. So if the dollar decrease so the criptocurrencies))))))
64 2018-01-14 18:13:11 Difícil que la carga impositiva no tenga nada que ver con que el sector que vende commodities sea justamente uno de los que tiene más dificultades para competir.

Your Excellencies.. Hope u are OK. Millions of Kenyans voted for u coz they believed in u. But everything is getting out of hand. Kplc, basic commodities, etc.. Can we get a relief? And things normalize?

67 2018-01-14 17:32:34 In fact you just proved my point that Bitcoin is useless. Besides, they are not “currencies” anyway - they are commodities. Like beanie babies or gold or chickens. Good for bartering or investing but that’s all. Blockchain is the real new thing, bitcoin is just an implementation.
68 2018-01-14 17:29:53 Our nation knows, he is a very talented person, but our people  think as a whole, that he is solely responsible for the price hike of all essential commodities, and the slump in business!.
69 2018-01-14 17:22:25 Begs question of how much of wheat/grains consumed in UK is grown in UK?

2. Los bonos son "commodities"?

3. Al ofrecer el Petro en los mercados internacionales de criptomonedas, estarían refinanciando la deuda?
73 2018-01-14 17:09:44 Paying off debt but mismanaged stolen aid monies by the government is the problem. I too was going to send ships full of rice as a commodities broker but was told it would be taken by government people and sold on black market

75 2018-01-14 16:59:34 Weaker dollar allow all the commodities to rise. And this is a part of currency wars which played by China in order to prevent USA's ''The New Great Game'' strategy.
76 2018-01-14 16:59:25 If USD FX rate was falling due to appreciations in counterpart currencies you’d tend to see gold & other commodities under pressure, not rallying. Also a less frothy risk asset backdrop. Alt theory: fiscal/reg change is pushing the US natural rate upward faster than Fed is hiking
77 2018-01-14 16:45:28 There is no reason for Bitcoin to be valued differently than Ethereum, except that people think it’s worth more. Same goes for gold or silver or beanie babies. Bitcoin and Ethereum are finite commodities. Anything that has value only has that value because people believe in it.
78 2018-01-14 16:41:06 Clubs are trading players like commodities. Focus all you want on the player but fans can also look at the facts - Liverpool is a selling club.
79 2018-01-14 16:39:06 Well yes, exactly. How else do we make use of these things without an interaction with human labour-power? Everything around you has been worked into commodities you've bought, all done by workers.

95 2018-01-14 15:30:06 Well if we are talking Ireland, because there are no routes to market for differentiated products and little policy or support to help them develop. It is all about commodities and centralized processing. We then try to premiumize the bog standard with 'marketing'.

106 2018-01-14 14:36:25 I agree 100% , the steps along the path

1) The creditor will seek stable sources to ensure it can produce (ie - commodities denominated in non-USD).
2) Understand that some of its existing stores of value will be worthless and exploit this (sell US denominated debts)

128 2018-01-14 12:28:51 Vairamuthu is a going-to-convert Christian like Bharatiraja, Gouthaman, Ranjith and Seeman. He is paid to talk bad of Hinduism by Churches. Lower caste fellows are easily purchasable commodities for churches.

130 2018-01-14 12:10:58 I think it depends if we continue to see the USD sell-off as that will only push commodities higher. For me Friday crossed a line. It will be an interesting open session tonight and week ahead.....

132 2018-01-14 11:44:59 Se que ya lo Aburrí con el discurso, pero le dejo mi última reflexión. Al productor Agropecuario de ROU no se lo describe con gráficas, tiene que ir a conocerlo y entender por qué no lo pueden arrancar de su tierra con precios de tierra o de commodities
133 2018-01-14 11:35:52 Also I've had all levels of being bothered by Arsenal battered out of me now. It feels like there's not even any point in being pissed off by the way we conduct running the club. It's no longer a football club it a business trading commodities in order to make profit only.
134 2018-01-14 11:34:40 Por qué eligen ROU, por qué argentina les retenía el 35% de su utilidad. Por eso también vienen argentinos a ROU. Inflan el valor de la tierra en base a especulación. Los commodities valen mucho, pero ROU produce poco en relación a la superficie explotada.
135 2018-01-14 11:25:00 Dividends is a big game and Americans will suffer. If you have a 401k that allows you to make movement, move out of these aggressive funds by April to commodities or capital preservation. Don’t risk your future on scam market. Deregulation & money games will collapse the economy
136 2018-01-14 11:23:54 When fuel prices goes up , so is the cost of production the fuel price increase simply means prices of basic commodities will consequently go up. 

And it's just the 14th day of 365×4
137 2018-01-14 11:16:35 Prices of commodities set to go up as well. We are doomed
138 2018-01-14 11:14:35 Nigerian revenue is a mixture of oil export and taxes, but bcus of income 4rm oil, d govt also neglected cash flow 4rm tax & non-oil export commodities. I hope govt realize d potency of d 2 sources to d treasure & as such, should commit more to diversifying d non-oil export base.
139 2018-01-14 11:01:35 Stop preaching and start reducing prices of basic commodities!
140 2018-01-14 10:58:31 Of course they can't give away costliest land in entire Nation to such insignificant body of soldiers. Being businessman he only understands cost and profit of commodities. U r expecting him to value our soldier's sacrifice is beyond his understanding. Navy not even a vote bank.
141 2018-01-14 10:45:19 Yes this has a cyclic Impact within #India, from decline of domestic production. This has led to Inflation of agro commodities which has even affected the govt PDS systems. TN and other states have stopped selling urad dhall to ration card holders. Vegetables in X dismal prices !

149 2018-01-14 08:23:56 Well, the BSP wants regularization after all. I read the Circular about it and yeah, nowhere did it states that using cryptos as speculative commodities are okay. That's why I am putting my distance towards cryptos for now.
150 2018-01-14 07:57:38 They need the same financial infrastructure around regular commodities to exist for crypto. That may take a few years. Also, 95-99.9% of existing crypto projects will probably not get institutional money.

152 2018-01-14 07:44:21 Yes it is expensive but think the argument is justification of a 300%+ profit on the beer. Yes hakuna mabasic commodities but still luxury items should not be soo exorbitant either..
153 2018-01-14 07:37:27 Goodluck and hope we will not see ad-hoc ban on agri commodities just becasue of price movement. Policy makers have to realise that futures prices is a reflection of fundamentals and is not entirely speculation. We have done enough damage to our mkt by ad-hoc measures @PMOIndia

160 2018-01-14 06:37:00 Jeez Grant take it easy eh? The article is using sxsw as a reason to ask “where are all the exciting new bands in Vancouver? Why are crusty old dads like Said The Whale going to Austin instead of hot new commodities?” Which is a pretty good question I think!

166 2018-01-14 05:33:33 Es probable q la baja de los commodities hasta afectado al sector, como en otros años lo favoreció enormemente. Lo mismo con el precio de la tierra.
A propósito los tres intendentes y el senador (todos blancos) ya podrían renunciar a beneficiarse de tierras de colonización no?

168 2018-01-14 05:26:37 I m very concerned about price increases that we are experiencing as a country.  Is it not possible to remove all import restrictions so that people can have access to cheap commodities.  The business community is exploiting us taking advantage of protectionist policies.

172 2018-01-14 05:13:58 Hope if tom prices of agri commodities start going up bcoz of fundamentals and gap btw demand and supply, govt pressurizes SEBI to ban the said commodity. We have done enough damage to our mkt by taking such ad-hoc measures. @SecretaryDEA @PMOIndia @narendramodi

178 2018-01-14 04:14:18 In my experience PWYW did not work for me. About 95% took it and paid nothing, zip, zilch, nada. Honour system does not work if the  community is not valuing these work as commodities.

185 2018-01-14 03:01:18 The Discourse is turning marginalized identities into commodities, desired, acquired and performed because within left/some liberal spaces they are perceived as imbueing one with increased authenticity, moral legitimacy, individualization/"uniqueness" and so on.
186 2018-01-14 02:52:39 Congratulations, they have successfully transformed you from citizens into commodities.
187 2018-01-14 02:47:26 I had been thinking Agüero but it's just a transfer out waiting to happen and FTs are precious commodities with more blanks and doubles approaching fast. So, I'm at a loss, basically.
188 2018-01-14 02:45:46 That’s about the extent of it. Commodities are the name of the game!  Horrible, horrible food. Won’t change anytime soon.

190 2018-01-14 02:31:19 This is too much. I fear for these young 'models'. They're treated like Battery Hens. This is beyond outrageous. Our world is broken when young kids are treated like goddamn commodities.
191 2018-01-14 02:21:15 So that you can use it for daily transactions. If it moves up and down and value too much, it's not an accurate way to value other commodities. It needs to be stable until it at least gets put on the network and gets used.

196 2018-01-14 00:51:17 I don't buy the more entrepreneurial part. We don't need to export commodities and we have Silicon Valley.

FWIW, if I got very sick and I could get it fixed immediately to be back at 100%, I'd happily go bk.

254 2018-01-13 21:01:22 Find your niche. Tech & commodities for me. I let good good trades pass all the time. Look @ QQQ & EEM ETF's.
255 2018-01-13 20:58:06 First deflation, then inflation. Jan 2016 is a bottom in commodities, we’re looking at the next major leg up. The USD is bearish and energy and the metals like copper are moving. Focusing on global resources in 2018 for max returns.
256 2018-01-13 20:52:18 What a horribly disappointing season to date. Possibly the most consistent player is j lamb, no offense to kemba, but too many 4-15 type nights  people say let’s tear it down, there’s only 3 or 4 trade-able commodities none of which would we possibly trade.
257 2018-01-13 20:45:56 i think we are seeing an unbundling of money / securities / commodities... 

 just like how information can be part book, infographic, article in the digital realm.... so too can digital money be simultaneously money / security / commodity.

258 2018-01-13 20:32:06 De esos, sólo Allende es incompetencia. A Bachelet le tocó la crisis global en su primer periodo, y el colapso de los commodities en el segundo. Era lógico obtener bajo crecimiento bajo esas circunstancias. A ver cómo gobierna Piñera con vacas flacas como las actuales.
259 2018-01-13 20:23:46 Murder and child sex slaves! Are 2 commodities she sold besides uranium!
260 2018-01-13 20:23:39 hunt refers to me as a “market opportunity” we have become commodities to the tory party, or more likely liabilities with organs to done.
261 2018-01-13 20:11:43 Uranium and Influence, two very sought-after commodities by World leaders.
262 2018-01-13 20:10:07 #FastFact: The U.S. is rich in many of the #minerals it requires and is a major exporter of some commodities, including iron ore, soda ash, #copper and cement.
263 2018-01-13 19:52:26 Canada is currently one of the few safe havens from rampant populism due to various factors including its more egalitarian society and its commodities based economy. Sadly the same cannot be said of Europe or the US.
264 2018-01-13 19:36:33 Unlike you, perhaps they believe it's immoral to make deals involving people's lives. These young people are not commodities to be traded.
265 2018-01-13 19:19:36 Why didn't we get inflation in 2003-2008 when commodities skyrocketed?
266 2018-01-13 19:15:09 Esse é um projeto engendrado pelas elites lociais subordinadas ao comando do mercado: transformar o Brasil definitivamente  em exportador de "commodities e soterrar de vez o objetivo de um país soberano e desenvolvido.
267 2018-01-13 19:01:09 Abbreviations in commodities is wealth signature
268 2018-01-13 18:52:45 Great article, Ben! With over two decades of experience running a commodity trading firm, I completely agree with your conclusion that commodities markets are for trading and not for investing. They don’t produce earnings or pay dividends.
269 2018-01-13 18:52:04 Do you think we're getting close to a similar environment/narrative now compared to early '08 with commodities and ex-US currencies and NASDAQ run up in 1999-2000 or still a ways to go?
270 2018-01-13 18:51:25 Americans are interchangeable commodities according to mini-McCain Lindsey Graham. Time to vote this guy out. #DrainTheSwamp #RINO #Globalist #BuildTheWall #KatesLaw @realDonaldTrump
271 2018-01-13 18:35:00 Breaking! It is not news that Trump is racist. It is not news that he treats women as commodities. It SHOULD be news that he cancelled penalties for a bank to which he owes 100s of millions, and which laundered Russian money.
272 2018-01-13 18:31:56 If they would bring back the commodities program used in 60s it would end foodstamp fraud !!!
273 2018-01-13 18:28:57 Gold, silver, oil and other commodities are also rising due to weak dollar. And weak dollar is a strategy of currency wars leading by China.
274 2018-01-13 18:02:56 The Trump administration is selling our national parks wholesale for commodities extraction.
275 2018-01-13 18:02:46 After Cryptocurrencies, the next trend will be the over-flow of space debris in the commodities market. These will be used to decorate our front-yards instead of soil destroying, fertilizer filled grass.
276 2018-01-13 17:50:21 Tbh I think most of the critiques of capitalism focusing on "consumerism" are kind of nonsense. People can define themselves by fashion and commodities without advertising.
277 2018-01-13 17:40:57 Quick Thoughts:

FOMO/Euphoria call it whatever. 
Truth is - Markets can go much higher. Don't fight the trend.
Trend Followers thrive in this market. 
Dollar weak, Euro up. Metals/Commodities up or moving.
Cash on sidelines. Await next setup. Be patient.
278 2018-01-13 17:37:23 O problema é mandar o petróleo bruto para os EUA a preço barato e comprar os derivados caros, um investimento em refinarias resolveria nosso problema. Mas o governo faz questão de não investirmos em tecnologia, então seguimos como exportadores de commodities...
279 2018-01-13 17:35:35 No. Slavery long b4 whites came. They were traded for iron and other commodities to the whites. I read. I still blame rich white Euros for present day Haiti
280 2018-01-13 17:22:27 Happy birthday @sanstocktrader one of the most dedicated traders working relentlessly and teaching selflessly...trades - stocks, then commodities and if I'm not wrong Forex too. 24 hours the mint is on. May all your dreams come true buddy, cheers !!
281 2018-01-13 17:21:59 In an environment where extremely limited use commodities like bitcoin, ripple, etc. can soar to crazy valuations,  how high can the best positioned companies in the world go, i.e. FAANG? The markets are telling us to expect anything to be possible.
282 2018-01-13 17:14:01 Global Growth, Rising Profits, Fiscal Stimulas....what’s not to like? Are we late in the cycle? Maybe. So why not match your allocation with some late cycle investments?  Commodities come to mind and we’re still in the early innings here!

284 2018-01-13 17:05:11 Hurting your case, not helping it. You have all of these commodities, and that is as far as you've come in 60 to 70 years.  Harvesting.  What will you do when they are depleted?  How many semi-conductor plants?  How many high-tech space industries?  Where is the service industry?

286 2018-01-13 16:58:31 According to the US BLS stats, prices for commodities were 125.66% higher in 1980 versus 1968, roughly 7% a year.  But US stock mkt generated similar returns over same time period.
287 2018-01-13 16:52:59 Me: Bitcoin is traded like just another Commodity..
Colleague: Don't insult commodities by comparing it with Bitcoin
Me: 

The guy who created blockchain technology is a savage geek... Mining the coins are the biggest achievement.. the reward is the Bitcoin
288 2018-01-13 16:49:38 I'm against exploiting harm. Recessions are harmful. You "Objectively," spoke of them as an opportunity. So, yes, I'm against that. I'm also against futures/commodities because they exploit basic needs. But, I still wasn't talking to you or about :you: personally.
289 2018-01-13 16:34:57 Surprisingly China a Force for good.level-headed. brought capitalism to its knees. GOP demonize China unsurpassed commodities
290 2018-01-13 16:33:54 Thus making it better to have companies compete with each other. Forcing people to pay for government commodities is unconstitutional. Socialized medicine is very low quality care. Ask all the Canadians that flock to the US to see a doctor.
291 2018-01-13 16:32:07 Annnnnnd, this is actually why I'd like to see at minimum, the futures and commodities markets eradicated. Because there are people who are okay with profiting off of HARM.
292 2018-01-13 16:31:44 Sadly the only thing that would impact a billion dollar industry is if its million dollar commodities protested which is the point of the op. If the viewers don't have the gumption to refrain how the hell you think those paid millions are gonna do it?
293 2018-01-13 16:29:41 Real estate and commodities don't belong in a financial investment portfolio. Buy a home to live in. Pay it off asap and never think about it as an investment. A paid for home is the foundation of financial freedom. It's not an investment. Nor are commodities.
294 2018-01-13 16:26:38 No they won't Jarvis  honestly maybe the Nets would, that's about it or a desperate team tryna clinch a spot, like Denver. They're not wanted commodities. You guys don't have to build on draft. Just get one guy, and build. Ya remind me of the Suns a couple years ago
295 2018-01-13 16:26:15 Isn’t this backwards looking and argues for reversion?  I think this why Gundlach is recommending commodities
296 2018-01-13 16:23:16 @ZimbabweUpdate shame! ordinary Zimbabweans can't access their money in banks, face price hikes on basic commodities
297 2018-01-13 16:23:05 Looks like a year for commodities. Bring it on Mr Inflation
298 2018-01-13 16:18:13 So how is it the NHS can provide medicine for a much cheaper rate? Commodities would inherently drive prices up because people generally like being alive so there will always be a demand.
299 2018-01-13 16:16:05 "Income inequality" is part of the free market. Labor & skills are commodities just like any other tradable thing.
So, should a dozen eggs and an automobile cost the same?
300 2018-01-13 16:10:53 Could be a macro trend that supports the recent bull market in commodities
301 2018-01-13 16:06:41 The economy that Obama saved from W destructions.  Which was moderate  measures.  This was not done for bleeding heart socialists.  Clinton signed commodities exchange act to help bonanza.  Wall Street is being reported as doing that same sham again.@paulkrugman @profwolff 
302 2018-01-13 16:02:58 Yeah, acting in Hollywood is a FOR PROFIT business. As I’m sure you’ll see, many female actresses with similar track records are making similar asks to Wahlberg. Commodities fetch premiums. Good on all people who have created that for themselves.
303 2018-01-13 16:02:29 I want my son to grow up in a world where he is not socialized to see women as commodities, or property, or responsible for his ego or sexual satisfaction. I want him to be free of the constraints of toxic masculinity, to love whomever he wants to love #whyIMarchOttawa

307 2018-01-13 15:49:02 As American soccer struggles with decisions about becoming more like European soccer, it would be prudent to note that European (particularly English) soccer is becoming more American-ized.

Whether it is the absurdly high salaries, the viewing of players as commodities (1/3)
308 2018-01-13 15:41:14 esta tendencia viene de gobiernos anteriores tb. Es un rasgo de la limitación que tiene nuestra economía basada en commodities
309 2018-01-13 15:36:53 Capitalism is about profiting off commodities over all else. It does not matter where you draw the line for what a profitable commodity is, because your ethical hold ups are another persons profiteering scheme - and a free market knows no boundaries. Fairness is not capitalist!
310 2018-01-13 15:22:15 Always why Rosa Luxemburg was wrong. The poor South much too poor to realize the colossal surplus of the North; it matters more for the production of surplus value and crucial input commodities that can't be produced elsewhere. Production, not realization.

313 2018-01-13 15:06:27 Donald Trump will drain the Country's treasury and high jack the surplus stockpiles of US. commodities. Leaving US. devided and bankrupt, like he has done many times with both his business and people exploited by the lying, racist, egoistric man child.

318 2018-01-13 14:38:08 Due to weaker dollar all commodities and currencies having a festival. But when the FED increase rates this picture can be reverse.
319 2018-01-13 14:33:39 Get creative and barter. I think you have access to some pretty valuable commodities that could start a damn good party.
320 2018-01-13 14:26:01 Mafia depende dos seus interesses. É óbvio que vivendo de commodities pra sempre fica difícil dizer, depende muito do que você vai ganhar com a relação
321 2018-01-13 14:25:43 Well the prices of commodities are increasing. I can’t afford pulse. Looks like the institution of Democracy is in danger!
322 2018-01-13 14:11:02 But the prices of all essential commodities r soaring high into the sky.
323 2018-01-13 13:48:00 All time highs in#Lumber,  new contract highs daily, robust demand, 20% tariffs, Seasonal patterns, robust commodities, etc  etc. Hard to bet against #lumber
324 2018-01-13 13:47:16 Yet the economy remains non-diversivied with two (three if you count oil) of the most highly priced commodities on the market potentially funding it.  Still after decades and decades, it's an agricultural and low-tech industry economy.
325 2018-01-13 13:47:08 Speaking of commodities... Some comments about the plutonium futures would be appreciated...
326 2018-01-13 13:41:34 Lula não foi responsável pela boa economia do Brasil naquela época, Brasil era grande exportador de commodities e a China importou muito dele isso gerou emprego e claro a economia cresceu, Lula não responsável p isso
327 2018-01-13 13:41:19 As a result, parents with kids are probably safe bets for good migrants from these countries. They don't want to go back, they want to raise their kid in a much better environment - one with clean water, steady electricity, and toilets. All commodities we take for granted.
328 2018-01-13 13:31:00 Revisit inflation next year this time as the delayed effect of excess money created starts chasing commodities again :-)
329 2018-01-13 13:30:49 All the farm commodities continue to simplify. Almost all are online now or both. They could have learned some lessons if they had looked at that.
330 2018-01-13 13:15:58 Bitcoin????
Historically, though, Islam has only recognized commodities of intrinsic value as money including things like gold (Dinar), silver (Dirham); rice, dates, wheat, barley and salt. In a strict interpretation of what qualifies as money, Bitcoin probably misses the mark.”
331 2018-01-13 13:05:57 @derrickg745 can I see something in a different colour . I think women are not commodities.
332 2018-01-13 12:50:58 with that said, miners and energy ones compared to their pricing of commodities, imho, these companies are ignored and may have more room to run as long as commodity pricing holds up or move higher.

334 2018-01-13 12:29:56 If I were a Governor in Nigeria, I will prioritize ELECTRICITY and INTERNET.

339 2018-01-13 11:51:22 Budget tax increase on basic commodities in Tunisia has attracted street riots. Will it be worse than Ben Ali's time?
340 2018-01-13 11:46:25 Stalin allowed millions to die in the Ukraine --- stole their wheat and sold it for money to build army.
British allowed million Indians to die of starvation rather than allow commodities market to suffer.
341 2018-01-13 11:41:57 As a 5th generation Farmer in CA the biggest problem Started with Clinton and his regulations on us and his increased taxes. He gave more $$ to other countries to farm while increasing the tax on our exported commodities. Which leads to increased food cost.

346 2018-01-13 11:01:48 1) European countries operate just fine with a combination of both. 

2) Trading in core food commodities are done neither by the producers nor the consumers. Purely profit driven.

354 2018-01-13 09:55:50 Hope we see India becoming a price benchmark in certain commodities like pulses, guar etc. which are grown in India, unlike in Nifty and INR which are India product but price benchmark getting exported to S'pore and Dubai due to regulators rigid policies. @PMOIndia
355 2018-01-13 09:54:07 It has been India bad luck that govt and policy makers rather than using futures as a signalling and hedging tool kept blaming the exchanges for promoting speculation. Thats why despite India being largest producer/consumer in many commodities is not price setter. @arunjaitley
356 2018-01-13 09:47:32 1) voluntary and coercive transactions are indeed mutually exclusive. There is either one or the other. One is Capitalism, and the other is socialism.

2) Commodities trading is trading done in markets where buyers and sellers are choosing (or not) to buy and sell.
357 2018-01-13 09:34:32 5. Case in point; is there any correlation btw that history and the shortages of basic commodities like fuel in a country with crude oil?
358 2018-01-13 09:29:40 1) capitalism & socialism are not mutually exclusive opposites
2) exploitation in food production is not at level of street market but in commodities trading, unfair trade with producers & supermarket monopolies
359 2018-01-13 09:21:22 I just met a CIO of a large commodities exchange in India. Baffled to know there are 34 intermediaries between a farmer and the buyer. All get a payoff. Farmer gets a fraction that too after 6 months. Technology reduced it to a month and 14 intermediaries.
360 2018-01-13 09:21:22 The problem is the American taxpayer pays twice. We have to pay for the American who is not working because they refuse to do manual labor and then we pay because the immigrant is taking wages below the minimum and needs assistance as well. #farmbill #commodities #welfare #snap

Besides considering the situation
all further credit lines will be squeezed
4m worldwide suppliers !!
365 2018-01-13 08:48:47 For. Me a bigger concern is that the prices of commodities cannot go down  without the farmers losing out, because the prices of inputs more than doubled as well, do we seriously expect the prices to be the "usual" come harvest?
366 2018-01-13 08:16:21 Agreed EU is more than a trading block (not ‘commodities’), but that is 1 area where EU is de facto ‘one country’.

367 2018-01-13 07:44:27 Prices of basic commodities have gone up more than 100% in the last 3 months. Here's a new threat: if drought hits Zim, as seems highly likely, food prices will shoot up further. The Famine Early Warning News Network says Zimstat's annual inflation is grossly understated at 2.97%

373 2018-01-13 06:25:25 No people arn't commodities but their skill are and basic economics of supply and demand determinants the price of their skills. Min wage always leads to loss of jobs in an economy where you have an oversupply of unskilled or low skilled individuals period!

376 2018-01-13 05:41:40 as much as I'm sympathetic to all political opposition to trump, I also recognize that probable >50% House & Senate changes and a possible <50% impeachment are (short-term) market negative

Commodities outlooks are more favorable than most equities

377 2018-01-13 05:19:06 The war on drugs is a decrepit facade, the capitalist state wants you to get high on commodities.
378 2018-01-13 05:17:12 They blame us for destroying the world when we built it. They take the commodities we made possible for granted. The world would still be sticks and stones if we let the inferiors take charge.

383 2018-01-13 04:43:39 "Teaching can be compared to selling commodities. No one can sell unless someone buys ... yet there are teachers who think they have done a good day's teaching irrespective of what the pupils have learned." #JohnDewey
384 2018-01-13 04:29:14 Me too.I’d be Leary of this cuz Russian mob has had lock on certain commodities for quite a while now.They’d skim a cent or two per gallon of fuel/oil/gas on east coast when I was growing up in 90s, but can’t ignore cuz Donnie’s long connection to monsters...
385 2018-01-13 04:27:09 Not very sure if it will strengthen Bhavantar yojna as under Mkt Assurance scheme, the states' responsibility will extend to disposing off the procured commodities and providing price deficit wouldn't be the only responsibility.
386 2018-01-13 04:26:51 People who throw out terms like "bubble" usually don't apply it to currency.  Commodities, like stocks, houses, et al, are different from currency markets.  People need to really educate themselves on currency trends and how to deal with them instead of thinking like stocks.
387 2018-01-13 04:19:17 Just realized that every marketing exercise or even job interview always begins with "selling yourself", and I think that says a lot of people are becoming commodities

391 2018-01-13 03:53:45 I don’t see that. The year before that, we saw Perriman and Kevin White and Devante Parker get drafted with high picks. White and Perriman did absolutely nothing their rookie years yet receivers went even higher the next season. WRs are commodities in today’s NFL.
392 2018-01-13 03:51:18 Team played well tonight, in fact, I was totally stoked at the way the Huskers fought their way back. Maybe they are better without Jordy, I don't know. I just hate to see kids treated as commodities and will always defend the student-athlete over coaches and administrations.

399 2018-01-13 02:37:32 Bolsonaro: Contra Reforma da previdência, Engasga ao falar de privatização, nunca se posicionou contra privilégio dos poderes, fugiu da mudança trabalhista e da terceirização, SÓ FALA DE COMMODITIES, mudou de posição sobre PEC dos gastos aos 45/2ºT... ISSO TUDO é direita? Reduz!!
400 2018-01-13 02:35:05 I was referring to decades of women being in the workforce (in the way they are now). No argument from me about the treatment of women as commodities throughout history.
401 2018-01-13 02:27:50 Probably, but believe she cares-she's not as cold as her husband. I bet though the prenuptial agreement addresses Donny's right to engage in extramarital activities. She gets so much money per year they are married, child support ...Women are commodities to DJT-that's the deal!
402 2018-01-13 02:19:41 Sadly, dems treat people more as commodities than living, breathing beings. In doing so, they consider immigrants only as voters above all else. The poorer, more needy their constituents, the more they propose laws to keep them needy and poor. It’s a gigantic fraud.
403 2018-01-13 01:54:45 ...or, maybe he did? . There were a lot of "wink, wink, nudge, nudge" comments he made to those boys because they TOTALLY get how women are mere sexual commodities 

(Thanks to the Boy Scouts of America for imparting that lesson upon our boys.)
404 2018-01-13 01:52:29 Alfonsin asumio con una guerra perdida , deuda , deficit fiscal , sin reservas , con precios de commodities por el piso y tasas altas . Politicamente era minoria en el congreso , el peronismo histerico por perder su primera eleccion ( ni ley de divorcio le votaron )
405 2018-01-13 01:09:46 So in your view the average American is irrelevant, just commodities or just votes to keep an idiot like you in office? Americans want immigration reform not the slop you're trying to foist on us.  Americans want the wall and border security.
406 2018-01-13 01:08:16 Yes!!! All those commodities kept school children alive

409 2018-01-13 00:56:02 At least they (in shitholes) would start farming/ranching/trading and get a free market economy. Going to be very hard work but that's how it is. The special interests that sell commodities will cut campaign cash. Good!
410 2018-01-13 00:54:27 Dont hear you talking about backwardation in key commodities markets, never mind Comex or CME where they settle in not the physical but in worthless fiat. No wonder you are out of touch
411 2018-01-13 00:54:23 Who is this fool spouting idiocy about chain migration on #Outfront at @ErinBurnett? It wouldn't "make sense to allow someone to bring their 70-year-old parent over.  They won't be able to contribute to the work force..." Humans are more than commodities!
412 2018-01-13 00:41:18 Shithole countries : corrupt countries with no respect for basic human rights that export people as commodities to richer countries for exploitation by the liberal elites.

415 2018-01-13 00:20:29 I doubt it. If China builds a lunar water mine, what's to stop NASA crashing the market by dumping cargo at artificially low costs into LEO? Why compete on fungible bulk commodities with a much simpler supply chain?
416 2018-01-13 00:17:57 But it's false. A fallacy. John Stuart Mill: "The demand for commodities is not the demand for labor." The decision to buy something is different from the decision to invest in new production.
417 2018-01-12 23:48:01 It was a hypothetical.  Losing $20 vs. making $30. Not sure why a KS/TX/ND farmer would plant wheat at a decent profit disadvantage just for the sake of "prime" area corn farmers. Commodities are cyclical, corn prices will improve just like spring wheat did in '17. #glasshalffull

722 2018-01-12 01:28:38 Mas sayang ang resources natin if we insist on producing things we have no ComAd over. You see, we use so much inputs and resources in producing rice when we can use those inputs sana in producing other commodities in much more lvl of quantity.
723 2018-01-12 01:28:30 Are these 2 propositions mutually exclusive? I don't think so. Land for rice is not the same for bananas/mangoes. Thus, saying that we have to focus on other commodities should not mean not planting rice. Rice is a staple, can't live w/out it! Lololol
724 2018-01-12 01:25:02 What im (and other renowned economists like Sec. Diokno and frmr NEDA Chief Habito) saying is instead of being so fixated at producing rice, we try other commodities which we have efficiency over like mango and banana
725 2018-01-12 01:17:03 Laurie paper said extra $334B was from commodities. Terms of Trade also exploded under Rudd/Gillard meaning non-mining exports exploded. What happened to all the extra money? Perhaps mining and agriculture do not generate as much revenue as people think
726 2018-01-12 01:06:58 All very plausible.  But going into 17 no one knew Pham and DeJong would be the top 2 hitters most of the season.
