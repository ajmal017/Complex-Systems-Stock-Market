153 2019-06-18 22:38:48 It's funny to see people's obsession/bias on different stocks. 

Some are watching every tick hoping it goes down and cheer over miniscule moves. Yet don't profit.

I don't understand this mentality at all. We're here to make money. Not be right.

164 2019-06-18 22:31:10 My guess is that investment in stocks contributes less to production than some say, but more than you allow.

I'd like to find a good book on this subject--and discuss.

I think your view is basically right--but too one-sided.
165 2019-06-18 22:30:57 Do they underweight high dividends stocks?
166 2019-06-18 22:30:10 Time and again, in every market cycle I have witnessed, the extremes of emotion always appear, even among experienced investors. When the world wants to buy only [bonds], you can almost close your eyes and [buy] stocks. - Michael Steinhardt

169 2019-06-18 22:28:50 Yeah stocks aren’t a thing you check every hour shit it could months before you see growth but ideally it’ll be less than that though

172 2019-06-18 22:24:49 It was through my bank. Only like 8 options and I think it was stocks or bonds and I know bonds are more secure but I didn’t know what percentage to direct to each one so I just put 100% into one type . I’m about to see if I can screenshot it to you.
173 2019-06-18 22:24:07 Yeah... nobody cares about quality Cannabis anymore. Just get rich quick buying Cannabis stocks bro. Buy buy buy, to the moon baby. Lambos soon. Everyone getting rich from Cannabis stocks. Buy buy buy.

183 2019-06-18 22:19:40 It matters enormously when there are limited stocks of housing, school places, GPS etc to go around. IQ disparity (huge predictor of social factors)matter. Having a PM who thinks 1400y old Arabic book is more important than anything in English law, matters.

213 2019-06-18 22:03:04 Funds are just managed groups of stocks - same issue. Commodities, like gold or oil, is just stuff to be resold later. Bonds are the only vehicle that might produce some investment, depending upon why the bond was created and sold. But they are generally a hedge.

216 2019-06-18 22:01:57 That is correct @grassosteve. This is not a lay up or for the shorts. Personally I think risk to reward is great.

218 2019-06-18 22:01:17 That argument is bovine excrement. Pure Malarkey. The "investment" rich people engage in are stocks, funds, bonds and commodities. Stocks are corporate trading cards. None of the money funnels back to the company, so it creates zero actual investment.

222 2019-06-18 21:57:45 President Trump indicated a smoothing of tensions with China over trade and stocks erupted higher. Of note, bitcoin hardly flinched on the news. This is perhaps significant in that a weakening yen has been seen recently as a main driver of the surge in digital-assets prices. DYOR

233 2019-06-18 21:49:57 Start with something like VOO (S&P 500 ETF, which trades 1:1 with the whole market; only 0.05% fee.) Try “paper trading” other stocks in the mean time. You can trade with fake $ to learn how it all works before using real $. Also, there’s a telegram fur group I can invite you to.

242 2019-06-18 21:46:53 Stocks rallied Tuesday, both in the United States & elsewhere, as positive sentiment about trade took hold of the market. The U.S. index Dow closed 350 points higher after word that U.S.  President Trump & China's President Xi will meet at the G-20, which sparked the rally.

257 2019-06-18 21:38:21 I'm pretty sure stocks can't design apparel.
258 2019-06-18 21:38:12 When the entire yield curve is at zero or below, stocks will go up--even shitty foreign stocks.
259 2019-06-18 21:37:48 This is what stocks are for.

262 2019-06-18 21:35:30 That doesn’t help anyone but the wealthy.
Very few average Americans own stocks.
Keep telling the trump base this means they’re doing better.
I’m not a trumpanzee. I’m not gullible.

276 2019-06-18 21:32:06 I personally think Wii Fit loses -1 due to Bayo able to get in and rack up damage fast along with having a projectile that beats both of hers and ability to gimp easily. Though, Wii Fit can take stocks easier and can combo Bayo hard. It was even before imo, but with buffs -1 imo.

281 2019-06-18 21:28:23 I don't know much about stocks yet, just started to look into them recently. Interesting to read though!

I do know that we can't access cheap us funds here in the Netherlands :(
282 2019-06-18 21:28:16 The thing about “capitalism” is that, like “socialism,” it is a trigger word and an obfuscating term that can mean anything to anyone. The two appellations are like over-stuffed stocks! One has coal and the other gifts-choose! Blind!
283 2019-06-18 21:27:25 Jason, this fed govt failed us by delaying this project by another 4 years. Will this attract more investment in our country, not a chance cause of the liberal red tape and uncertainty. I have invested my hard earned dollars on foreign stocks, why, because of positive returns
284 2019-06-18 21:27:21 I'm self employed. I trade stocks. I have a great time doing it.  Working for someone is for chumps.

288 2019-06-18 21:26:25 They know. 90% of them will say, "I don't like Trump, but I like what he's doing." 
Then when you ask, they'll mutter something about the economy. When you ask for details, mutter "stock market".
Ask if they own stocks? "Well no." Then how is the economy better for you? Silence.

296 2019-06-18 21:20:35 We have lost more rights under @realDonaldTrump. We lost bump stocks, no thanks to you, we now lost silencers, and now we have Red Flag laws which basically disregard the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 14th Amendments. @NRA is profiteering more important than the 2nd Amendment?!

371 2019-06-18 20:43:24 Well that’s not quite true.

A tweet can make stocks lose value but most of them, if they are good companies, will eventually recover and surpass their old highs.

Warren Buffet actually made a really good point about that.

385 2019-06-18 20:34:03 私たちの株式投資への意欲をなくさせるような要因がかなりある。
There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks. (131)
386 2019-06-18 20:32:51 I hear ya bro but tbh $XRP just smells like a lemon. I trade penny stocks for years and I can smell them a mile away. Just my view. I see how much of a believer you are (from your other replies) and I worry for you.

388 2019-06-18 20:32:07 Thats interesting given instos are heavily overweight bonds and cash and defensive stocks.
389 2019-06-18 20:31:57 Yes, this is for any year group. Miss Stocks is collecting all entries until the deadline: Friday 21st June. Good luck!
390 2019-06-18 20:31:53 I had to sell couple of stocks today. Tired of Trump talking, stock market goes down.
391 2019-06-18 20:31:53 Just invested in my first stocks 
392 2019-06-18 20:31:38 They would tell you the market is higher.  But then ask how many stocks they own and if they have a retirement plan.  That's where they go south.
393 2019-06-18 20:31:13 Never know these penny stocks are crazy
394 2019-06-18 20:30:00 HDFC Bank ( $HDB ) has declared a $0.626 per share annual dividend. However, it will go ex-dividend tomorrow. 

#investing #stocks
395 2019-06-18 20:29:08 Well, it doesn't invest in US stocks, and it's outperformed it's benchmark by 50%. Had it been invested in US stocks it probably would have done the same...
396 2019-06-18 20:28:47 Just a cheap pump. Embrace and buy tech stocks at any price
397 2019-06-18 20:28:22 Though not as well as some of the top tens, it is moving up. My 20% off xrp is still bigger gains than my stocks. I do wish I bought some more #btc or #eth for the beginning of this run. Still, I'm very confident in #xrp long.
398 2019-06-18 20:27:47 Two other stocks I sold/trimmed to fade today's rally were $VEC @ $39.19, +$4.00/share, and $MOS @ $24.06, +$1.31/share.
399 2019-06-18 20:27:08 Haha. Not yet. The correlation is something I ll be backtesting it today. But just eyeballing this divergence happened on May1st week, Dec 13 and Sept 20. Historically all resulted in stocks down and Vol up.

We do not want to go back to the past.

Instead we are stuck with old men and oil stocks.

408 2019-06-18 20:24:19 #Stocks,#Indexes Refresher: all valid top and bottom signals, going back over two decades, have been signaled by BOTH Type R and Type A Models signaling simultaneously. Numerous times, one model or the other signaled alone, and the market did not reverse.

Bitcoin is never closed. @APompliano
411 2019-06-18 20:21:31 #Stocks,#Indexes Because with equivalent rationality we cannot conclude the Type A is NOT top-signaling. Maybe this wobble does not matter. We just don't know. On balance, however, we side with staying long...for now.

414 2019-06-18 20:18:11 Stocks surged on Tuesday as Wall Street increased bets on a U.S.-China trade deal after President Donald Trump said he will be meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, at the upcoming G-20 summit. #StockMarketUpdate

419 2019-06-18 20:17:00 Predictable for two reasons: firstly esg salespeople argue the opposite and secondly cliff asness in a brilliant article showed why the  sin stocks outperform( higher cost of equity).
420 2019-06-18 20:16:55 #Stocks,#Indexes ...Type R top signal.  BUT: the coincident Type A exhibits a wobble in one curve we've not seen before. So this is just a warning for now. Nothing we can rationally conclude is in fact a top signal.  But it is a cause for concern.
421 2019-06-18 20:16:36 Stocks post broad gains as Trump holds out hope for China trade deal, and as bond yields fall further.

Dow ends +353, +1.35% to 26,465 -- less than 2% from all-time high of 26,951.

Nasdaq +1.4%, S&P +1.0%.

Winners top losers by more than 2/1 on NYSE and Nasdaq.

423 2019-06-18 20:15:04 Going by Trump’s messaging to the markets, if the Fed cuts rates tomorrow, then stocks will rally straight up for the rest of his presidency.  If Fed doesn’t cut, then stock market Armageddon begins immediately, along with a public beheading...
424 2019-06-18 20:14:46 #Stocks,#Indexes We all know a major top is coming. One overt sign will be curiously upbeat chatter betraying the spell of the endless rally fantasy. We have no doubt a major top signal will give it all away. And we have one component thereof right now, a very well organized...

446 2019-06-18 20:02:21 Most sources do factor in inflation since they tell you to invest in stocks rather than a savings account because inflation will eat some of your value each year. I think some call this out as being due to inflation and others don’t
447 2019-06-18 20:02:04 Alright so last week I said I was going to start playing stocks and I’ve learned a lot already. Overall I started last week good and ended down like 300 and this week I already made that 300 back plus 140 bucks. It’s deadass more addicting than the casino lol

It's bad.

Need to be more patient.

I stick to what I know and shorting stocks is not one of them :)
543 2019-06-18 19:13:05 Could be! I'm a stocks guy so I generally stick to the Facebook impact. But the people who know about crypto that I speak to seem to see the new Libra offering as not a competitor to traditional crypto coins, which is allowing them to continue running. That's the main gist.

582 2019-06-18 18:56:57 Yes it does seem like that dosnt it. I wonder why!

Yes that's true, I guess it's perhaps targeted at people who want more of a sense of stability / less risk.

For less risky stocks I like buying dividend payers to buy and hold.

643 2019-06-18 18:31:07 Stocks #1 driven only by wealthy with means to buy and sell on a daily basis making economy appear to do well. They forget when markets in red we are losing. For the wealthy, they just made profits to make more when the call to bring in the green again.

646 2019-06-18 18:28:26 It should boost it short term and cause a parabolic move up in growth stocks just like in 98-99, just like in 07. Why is it different this time? Crashes follow always.

662 2019-06-18 18:22:52 I can't advise on stocks to own. To be honest. It has to be at least a year, maybe longer since I actively invested. My old routine was 7 days a week, sunup to sundown. I made great returns like that for five years. I began focusing on patient needs. I lack the work to know!
663 2019-06-18 18:22:36 GE and Kodak are my only two big misses with personal stocks. Still hope for GE to fix but Kodak I’ve almost written off at this point. Have some cheap gold companies let’s see if they pay off with the recent rise

674 2019-06-18 18:19:14 Another good option is their "Target Retirement Date" Funds. They have a good exposure to international funds U.S and bonds. I would personally choose the fund date furthest out (2060) to keep my allocation 90%stocks/10% bonds. Here the expense ratios for those are .0015%

678 2019-06-18 18:18:49 That is a big lie. Technically you don't own personal stock but you buy and sell in your trust name. So yes you do own stocks as long as you click buy and sell. Be a man and take some responsibility
679 2019-06-18 18:18:35 That's why I'm buying 10s and 30s right now.  Gotta get em' now before interest rates go to zero. I started buying 10s when they were at 2.5% and haven't looked back. #investing #Stocks #bonds #yield #StockMarket

686 2019-06-18 18:16:06 “I don’t want this to sound too literal, but between cannabis and psychedelics, it’s sort of the difference between conventional and nuclear weapons,” he said. “I don’t see psilocybin as something that will become legal in Canada or necessarily ever should be.”
687 2019-06-18 18:16:03 I deal with this every day.. people immediately think you mean hundreds of thousands when you mention "stocks". "What's a good figure to start with?" Is a constant question, and "literally whatever you have" is almost never accepted.

699 2019-06-18 18:11:34 The point is you don’t have to be an expert to want some regulations and changes to guns in America.  The traitors at the NRA won’t allow any regs at all. Are bump stocks a right? Armor piercing bullets? Gun show background checks for private sellers?

1) lots of new players who don't know the name well incl technicians who don't care abt fundies

3) Today could mark trend change depending on the close (esp if down)

772 2019-06-18 17:34:01 Do you understand the analysis that goes into a shareholder's decision to keep or sell stocks? Do you think there is R245b floating freely somewhere in Naspers' account waiting to be paid to the GEPF?

783 2019-06-18 17:31:09 Nope didn’t say that. Trump using executive action to reclassify bump stocks as machine guns, and appointing an anti 2A person to run the ATF are things that lay the ground work for anti gun policy and politicians in the future.

816 2019-06-18 17:15:00 Yeah I was planning on taking out a % of my profits during the next stock market crash bottom and buying up some stocks at a good value. Hoping we will be at $50-$100 at that point. Then sit on my hands again.

899 2019-06-18 16:43:56 Correct me if I am wrong? Everytime the economy faces some crisis, MF holdings in Nifty stocks increase. Stock markets facing another such crisis currently? (1)
900 2019-06-18 16:43:38 Stocks surged after announcement US & China will meet at the G-20. Stocks got a boost as investors bet the @federalreserve will set the stage for more accommodative monetary policy. Investors will monitor whether policymakers lay the groundwork for rate cuts later in the year
901 2019-06-18 16:42:39 I've had situations in the past where I have sold call spreads on stocks like this. I get exercised on a hard to borrow stock and pay thousands in borrow fees, even if I cover instantly. It's a risk

916 2019-06-18 16:39:22 GDP is 2%, inflation is 2%, stocks are near all time highs, jobs market is full employment. Further easing just stokes the never ending debt bubbles, keeps zombie corporations alive by offering discounted liquidity and removes all risk premium for ‘risky’ investments
917 2019-06-18 16:39:04 On a similar note, so many players stress themselves when they lose stocks (sit back, wipe their hands/sweat) and don't realize that's how they lose focus during a match.

926 2019-06-18 16:36:01 In a hyper-inflationary currency debasement, is it not illogical that certain stocks would see significant gains in terms of the local currency? Trapped wealth would have little choice but to seek quick access to assets with the potential to hold relative value.

1022 2019-06-18 16:02:33 Yes ! It is a strong support, bulls are not letting it go below.

1026 2019-06-18 16:02:24 It is poison watching stocks you don't own, used to own, should have owned, go up. Don't do it. 
1027 2019-06-18 16:02:19 Did the super stocks seal the deal?
1028 2019-06-18 16:01:32 Canadian energy stocks giving up their gains. Sell the news or is will TMX actually face more hurdles?
1029 2019-06-18 16:01:26 #FakePresident, (Reuters) - Global stocks rallied on Tue & benchmark gov bond yields tumbled after ECB President hinted at economic stimulus, while equities got an extra boost when U.S. President confirmed a meeting with China’s President amid the countries’ trade dispute.
1030 2019-06-18 16:00:46 Hahaha! From the guy who sends tweets shit talking companies only to see their stocks tank afterwards. BTW how many shares of Amazon did you and your cronies pick up after your feud with Bezos? Don't think for a second the SDNY and the SEC aren't on to you.
1031 2019-06-18 16:00:44 European stocks fly following an earlier dovish Draghi and positive trade talk from Donald Trump re China this afternoon

1032 2019-06-18 16:00:40 $BYND is the Donald Trump of stocks - getting whiplash with insane, crazy, irrational moves ! 
1033 2019-06-18 16:00:17 I want to come! If I were well it would be this summer. Sad face. Maybe even move down that way. I like to travel by living places for a year and I can't trade stocks anywhere in the world. 
1034 2019-06-18 16:00:16 Stocks 
1035 2019-06-18 16:00:12 Investors:  We might just have a great formula coming together, the Fed might cut interest rates soon, and the US-China trade deal has re-emerged as a strong probability of becoming a reality.  Stocks today are running very Bullish, and THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING!
1036 2019-06-18 16:00:07 I already got that one I’m trying to like see the analyst review before the stocks get hot
1037 2019-06-18 15:59:54 Stocks now realizing tweets might be coming from a seriously mentally ill paranoid sociopath...
1038 2019-06-18 15:59:48 Whts the point of all these good developments if only 15 stocks moves up and optically shows that markets/nifty doing well but real picture is really bad in broader markets
1039 2019-06-18 15:58:59 Best performing stocks in our portfolio today is $UPLD second is $SSNC and third is $KL
1040 2019-06-18 15:57:47 And these scum want respect put in the stocks and shamed is all they deserve
1041 2019-06-18 15:57:00 It’s easier to trade in stocks that are generally doing well. Think of it as swimming with the current vs against it. Trade with the trend.
1042 2019-06-18 15:56:50 looks like its time to give up on oil stocks...dow up 350 points, oil up 2$, pipeline about to be approved today but oil and gas stocks doing nothing.

1044 2019-06-18 15:56:36 Sauf que nous ne travaillons pas à la JYP donc nous ne pouvions pas savoir qu'ils allaient baisser les stocks au moment de commander ? 
On a le droit de dire qu'on est étonné/déçu de pas avoir nos albums de Sk en tant que fan et collectionneur, je vois pas ce qui n'est clair là

1046 2019-06-18 15:56:28 I should have known Trump was going to be pumping stocks today as he will be looking to boast at his campaign run announcement 
1047 2019-06-18 15:55:50 Well, we do pero baka naman naubosan lang talaga nang stocks dun. :(
1048 2019-06-18 15:55:15 Nothing but optiin stocks today or big stops! Fb is what everyone was talking about this morning.
1049 2019-06-18 15:54:26 That’s modinomics - Index ATH....portfolios and stocks multi year low! So are the businesses, jobs, economy!!
1050 2019-06-18 15:54:18 Can someone dressed in a full American flag sweat suit (maybe emblazoned with an Eagle or Wolf?) walk up to McConnell and right hook/just knock him the hell out?  
Or maybe lock him up in public stocks and throw vegetables at him?
1051 2019-06-18 15:54:08 I now have both MGI and WU stocks. See how this pans out
1052 2019-06-18 15:54:07 $bynd Beyond Meat just hit session low of $162.30 after hitting all time high today of $201.88. Crazy!! #BeyondMeat #plantbased #marketwatch #globalwarming #stocks

1055 2019-06-18 15:53:04 Can you please calm down. US Stocks saw the same benefit too, they rallied during Draghi's speech.
1056 2019-06-18 15:52:47 Great day on Wall ST.  Dow up 400 points.  Some stocks though are a drag on the market, PM (Philip Morris International) has been a real heavy drag on the market.
1057 2019-06-18 15:52:39 you have stocks and you have tokens. let your users/supporters earn some money for being loyal and producing.
1058 2019-06-18 15:52:26 A few years ago I didn't know anything about stocks but I knew I wanted to get in.  So I went around doing extensive research. The most important thing I'll leave is to respect the research.

1061 2019-06-18 15:50:37 Trump needs a win but the last month doesn't paint a picture that they're close to a deal.
Cheering stocks.  Attacking Powell, Drahgi is laughable...they are the ones keeping his lights on.
All seems so fragile.  Yet so fired up.
1062 2019-06-18 15:50:27 $QQQ if u look at the growth stocks (the ones everyone follows) its actually not outperforming today vs the QQQ or Naz  like u expect (2x+)
1063 2019-06-18 15:50:04 I’m talking of the common small investor. Yes bank may go further down, most weak stocks look too low to short now. Bata could be shorted at 1400, just my personal opinion
1064 2019-06-18 15:50:02 Really stocks are down but you think it’s good
1065 2019-06-18 15:49:55 that portfolio allocations need to be big enough to matter

for example, 2% in small-cap stocks might look like diversification on the surface but it doesn't really impact overall portfolio P&L
1066 2019-06-18 15:49:45 In theory I agree. But even if we did away with farm animals the land utilised for them would be used for veggies.
In 20k years we have gone from 10% of the planet to 90% compared to free roaming animals. Fish stocks worse. There is a bigger problem here than people realise
1067 2019-06-18 15:49:34 Penny stocks...liking $SHMP and $HUML
1068 2019-06-18 15:49:25 If you have Money, buy stocks o. Don’t let any “experienced” nitwit tell you otherwise.

1074 2019-06-18 15:46:59 I need someone that knows about stocks in my life.
1075 2019-06-18 15:46:32 Could you possibly be any dumber about the world and the economy especially the global economy and stocks in general... WTF am I saying you get paid to spread disinformation.
1076 2019-06-18 15:46:31 nifty is driven by a handful of quality stocks ... if they perform nifty wont care for thee pieces of crap
1077 2019-06-18 15:46:29 The Fed’s track record isn’t great with stocks at record highs. $SPX has closed at record highs the day before 8 of 89 Fed days in this bull market. Average return on those 8 Fed days? -0.4% (high return of 0.06%, low return of -0.93%)
1078 2019-06-18 15:45:17 I believe in buy high, sell higher.  I love momentum investing with stocks who have a ROE of 30% or above.  This will narrow your list to a manageable set of stocks.  Look for EPS at 99 and RPS above 90 and your list becomes even smaller.
1079 2019-06-18 15:45:04 Got to have some German stocks

1093 2019-06-18 15:41:16 I recently opened robinhood account for stocks. Just did a simultaneous comparison on both apps, I was getting more btc for same dollar amount on robinhood. Coinbase fees is pretty high.

1097 2019-06-18 15:40:40 not sure. i use for stocks. but atleast they have some process hence i have liked. try and decide.
1098 2019-06-18 15:40:29 So, like stocks is the retail investor in bonds last to the party too?
1099 2019-06-18 15:40:19 What number of stocks do you track on regular basis and how frequently do you change your tracking list?
1100 2019-06-18 15:40:19 Okay, that's fair. I'd also love to see how this impacts returns; if returns are not impacted/higher then unionized stocks is money on the table. Buy/sell side analysts don't see it this way. It'd be a good check on the mechanism (esp if mechanism is managerial influence).

1102 2019-06-18 15:39:37 Huh? This seems like the most coherent Trump has ever been. Bank of Europe hints at stimulus, European stocks go up, boo hiss dirty foreigners are cheating.

1104 2019-06-18 15:39:27 Bottom seems to have fallen off from 'out of favour' stocks. 

Good time to mull what constitutes value in a stock. 

Unusually high proportion of value resides in transparency, integrity, predictable growth and trust.

1106 2019-06-18 15:38:52 #Trump says talking to #China soon but markets don’t seem to buy it. Bond yields are lower. Draghi’s promise of additional stimulus is also weighing in. 10 yr down another 5 bps at 2.04%while Bunds off 8 bps. Now -0.32%! Surprisingly stocks are up 1%

1107 2019-06-18 15:38:47 If not specific stocks then recommend some mutual fund -equity or index or any which you feel is the right way considering the present situation and future

1112 2019-06-18 15:37:20 No Americans own those stocks.
1113 2019-06-18 15:37:06 Think the problem goes beyond O&G. Any good news and shares tend to pop up 10-15% then retrace, while any bad news is brutally punished by a huge drop. Been a horrible market for a while now. Am  busy trying to stick to stocks least likely to have bad news / avoiding binary plays
1114 2019-06-18 15:36:47 That will be just great for stocks
1115 2019-06-18 15:36:45 That market is mostly driven by emotions lately and pumped/dumped by the reactions of one POTUS  we better just stay in Bitcoin long term and possibly just some semiconductor stocks.
1116 2019-06-18 15:36:33 Funny for a guy who I’m sure makes market statements so he can buy and sell stocks accordingly.

1118 2019-06-18 15:35:52 With stocks at new highs, unemployment at 50 year lows & the Fed fighting for its institutional independence, the market's faith in a 50 bp insurance cut absent a clear and present financial/economic crisis seems rather misplaced.

2 Markets are heavily data driven & interest rate influenced.

1149 2019-06-18 15:25:41 Absolutely. Stock market is stupendous. I made more $ these past 3 yrs in stocks than I ever did working for a salary. Even w/anti-NY tax bill taxes are LOWER. I'll never have to work again. If market crashes I'll just live on interest. Maybe it's time to trade in the Mercedes.

1157 2019-06-18 15:23:44 “Pro Tip: from a non pro myself. Playing with size buy ITM or directional Near the money. My strengths spreads. I play stocks that are repetitive with Daily/Weekly range. If avg range is normal u can easily trade that and nothing else.  4pt ranges pay 50-300% always”-ninja 2019

1159 2019-06-18 15:22:50 $BYND Trade school for everyone, BYND opened at 200 then ran to 201 before going red and tanking down into the gap, now at 175. This is why we don't chase stocks on the open and why I said 196 was a no buy zone for this stock
1160 2019-06-18 15:22:12 Stocks surging higher today on speculation that the fed will leave rates alone next week and possibly a rate cut before the end of the yr.

1162 2019-06-18 15:20:58 I think we need a national trading tournament. I’m talking 5K+ entry fee, broken up into a few different rounds, traders who makes the most profits, move on. Different leagues.. Forex, stocks, options, ETF’s, etc. Does this exist?

1166 2019-06-18 15:19:16 Roughly one-quarter of the S&P 500’s 15% gain so far this year comes from five high-profile stocks: Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB).
1167 2019-06-18 15:18:57 There is need to immediately raise sugar minimum sake price to 33/- and give incentive to mills to hold sugar stocks as buffer because there might realy be lower sugar cane availability in next season because of production deficite in TN, Karnataka and Maharashtra.

"Slide Iron Stocks" "Bullet Buttons" "Thumb Hole Stocks", rifles are more powerful TODAY than they were in 1993. Who knew? I thought a .223 has always been a .223? So the a 5# weight is heavier today than 1993?

1181 2019-06-18 15:14:55 I buy stocks based on brand, industry, and/or, most importantly, tips from people I trust (in person & on socials)

This strategy has earned me a 30%+ ROI over a 20 month period, so save me the lecture on extensive research & market analysis
1182 2019-06-18 15:14:39 Infact old ppl should stick to fixed assets like FD or others that offer stable returns even if it's low as their risk profile cannot accommodate wild swings/volatility in stocks...Govt can offer bonds with a cap of say 10 - 15 lks for olds, otrs with higher interest rates
1183 2019-06-18 15:14:34 That should manipulate the market to drive up stocks today
1184 2019-06-18 15:14:17 So where last decade's QE had to trickle through financial institutions into tech stocks, next decade's can go straight into technocratic crypto-commercial central banks. What's the profit model? Suck in as much capital as they can from the world's institutions
1185 2019-06-18 15:14:04 U don't need to have fabulous stocks in your portfolio.

1198 2019-06-18 15:09:48 Stop taking financial advice from silver tongue grifters & those allowed to suckle on the teet of America through privileged. The advice they give is irrelevant as you can not invest in stocks & bonds when you can not afford to eat. You do not need to purchase their crash course.
1199 2019-06-18 15:09:14 And stocks melt up? I’m thinking a marginal new high over 3000 and then down.
1200 2019-06-18 15:08:26 One more: Some stocks may look really expensive when co is small(some even valued on MC/sales) but does it make sense to invest in them looking at future market opportunity? Specifically referring to US tech IPOs in past and present. I know this isn’t your style of investing

1205 2019-06-18 15:07:00 "While about half of households own stocks in one way or another, the richest Americans hold the lion’s share of the value."  Top 10% of wealthiest Americans enjoy 84% of US stock ownership, while next 10% enjoys about 150% as the remaining 80% in other words.

1228 2019-06-18 15:00:35 No reason on Earth for the Fed. to cut rates tomorrow. Mario Draghi/ECB policy announced today was enough to push rates here in the US lower and vault stocks higher. The Fed's goal was achieved via the ECB.. the plan all along...

1234 2019-06-18 14:59:03 Yeah, that's true. I think my problem comes down to stats/probability. Much of the world's top-tier "success" (billionaires, 10x return stocks) is a result of selection bias, luck. On negative side, exploitation, cheating, etc.

1309 2019-06-18 14:41:00 A lot of the Dow's (and other indexes') price is due to herd investors taking on margin in their brokerage accounts and then indiscriminately buying and bidding up stocks beyond what the underlying economics warrant.

1358 2019-06-18 14:28:26 The analytical support for a rate cut doesn’t exist. Stocks near ATHs, rates have been near all time lows for decades, full employment. Fed doesn’t care trade deal no trade deal, if they cut rates it’s simply giving in to political & market pressures. IMHO
1359 2019-06-18 14:27:58 Yes it does its like my old saying tap on tap off. Although this really has been an extended period of low liquidity bar a handful of stocks. I agree on your capitulate theory before big push ups.
1360 2019-06-18 14:27:51 and most cyclicals are near lows

seems mostly big index stocks that are holding up

average stock is not with 2% of highs
1361 2019-06-18 14:27:47 Is it possible for a stock worth 100 quotes at 20-30?

In 2009, 90% of stocks at that level. In 2013, several small & mid caps traded at that level.

Then, why did few buy?

Ramesh Damani on 2009: sitting on cash & saw bear markets. found value. Still, did not have guts to buy
1362 2019-06-18 14:27:44 i am fully positioned for shorting. But, I read what Draghi said. He went even more dovish, and 1-up'd Powell the day before his speech. I expected Powell to be hawkish as stocks are near ATH, but with Europe doing more QE, Powell may have to come out a touch more dovish to match
1363 2019-06-18 14:27:41 Yep because we are in a Central bank induced BUBBLE exacerbated by Trump talking shit and giving corporates tax cuts to buy back stocks - it’s going to end in years it’s just a matter of timing

1367 2019-06-18 14:25:57 I think the market will sell off regardless of what Powell says. I doubt they’d cut this month and will most likely be ambiguous about cutting rates in the next couple of months. I’m sick of Trump’s games with China. Stocks are already trading like that’s resolved.
1368 2019-06-18 14:25:49 Rebalance: get back to desired Asset Allocation %’s. If start at 90/10, end of year will be different due to different returns of stocks and bonds. #financialeducation

1379 2019-06-18 14:22:19 I kind of disagree with this analysis. One difference between paintings and stocks is the latter have fundamentals. So while it's certainly true companies and industries go in and out of style, fundamentals create some valuation parameters. That's not really true for paintings.
1380 2019-06-18 14:22:05 It needs to be called out whenever it occurs IMO.  I have in the past called Pranab & PC charlatans when they forced to LIC to buy dud stocks or reneged on PSU Nav Ratanas etc.  But fudging GDP data & hiding a fiscal deficit o 1.5% of GDP is of a class by itself.

1419 2019-06-18 14:11:21 Indeed. Because you can't even try to tell me the rich work harder than the poor.

Poor people bust their ass in multiple shit jobs. Rich people inherit wealth, shuffle stocks around, only work hard at hiding their money offshore to avoid taxes, and fight to keep wages low.

Bonds likely are most right.

1543 2019-06-18 13:39:10 I’m definitely really loving the idea of using a simple weekly breakout/#trendfollowing approach on single stocks as a component of a total portfolio- especially if you are a novice and/or full time worker. Catches the big boy moves for years

1551 2019-06-18 13:37:53 @carlquintanilla Stocks back to nearly all-time highs, bonds back to nearly all-time low yields and the FED made a mistake hiking 1/4 of 1%?
1552 2019-06-18 13:37:48 Stocks booming, dollar booming and gold is booming lol. Time to play catch up short $Gold $XAUUSD I like this level tremendously for a longterm swing trade
1553 2019-06-18 13:37:44 I dont follow fundamentals much...don't loose hope in markets as many busted their capital at start..only way to earn in markets is to keep losses small and profits higher with 50% stocks giving you profits is enough
1554 2019-06-18 13:37:03 The closer AG Barr gets to bringing down the Deep State... the more programmed shooters they will send out. With bump stocks and silencers and AR’s with multiple mags, and body armor.... you just cant make this shit up... wake up - can’t be this many coincidences
1555 2019-06-18 13:36:21 Had one of your posts up when it was designed (hence the title line play on words). As bat-shit crazy we all are (me included) to trade intraday or short-term swings ... making newbies learn on highly liquid and stable stocks like large caps I 100% agree with.

1557 2019-06-18 13:36:11 The main 2 apps that make me money are Coinbase. You can buy & sell cryptocurrencies on the app.   If you don’t want to experiment with crypto than another app is Acorns.  Acorns invest your spare change into stocks and bonds. You could try both with as little as $25.

1569 2019-06-18 13:31:13 Yesterday was an excellent day for most cannabis stocks. Many of them tried to sell off lower, then closed higher, well outperforming the broad market. One day does not a trend make, but let's see how the week closes. Is the correction over?
1570 2019-06-18 13:31:05 As for stocks or the sp 500 I am neg  for a few days here odds of a wave B  rally is very high

1592 2019-06-18 13:26:42 Yeah but you forget that the Japanese stock market has been in the doldrums for decades and rates have been at zero there for many many years and company profits hosed - so that doesn’t mean stocks in Europe or US will be retracted higher - even if 10y US does make it dwn to 1pct
1593 2019-06-18 13:26:34 Maruti falls for 5th day in a row

  “Fundamentals for auto stocks are deteriorating. A slowing economy, piling up inventories and subdued demand have been weighing on them,” said Sameer Kalra, Founder, Target Investing.
1594 2019-06-18 13:26:07 USD & Stocks may move a lot when DJI starts 22:30 (JST = GMT+9h)
1595 2019-06-18 13:25:35 Your view on how stocks are likely to react to a possible interest rate cut by the Fed is probably dependent on your view of the economy and whether a recession is imminent. 

Or at least it should be.
1596 2019-06-18 13:25:27 Idk why I never got my book. Support just said sorry it might not come and to just read the American hedge fund it's the same thing 
1597 2019-06-18 13:25:24 Yields drop sharply on ECB. US stocks respond with strong gains (banking on more rate cuts from the Federal Reserve). House of cards. Scary.
1598 2019-06-18 13:24:36 That could happen eventually, but the recession that accompanies such a drop in sovereign yields will take down stocks before they re-rate higher.

1612 2019-06-18 13:18:36 @dseLIVEtrader per last post. doesn’t that imply odds increase for for stock move to ATH wout that 2 month down move first as  everyone bearish stocks and long bonds at the moment. Or is that smart money allocation and correct per stocks down bonds up ober next 2 months or so.
1613 2019-06-18 13:17:08 Thinking it may be stocks.  We are the only place in the world that has any yield.

1673 2019-06-18 12:55:47 How do I get there? Well, take 12 million acres off the original intentions down to 80.8M planted acres. Next, drop yield down to 160.

1679 2019-06-18 12:53:56 Free speech was meant for 'a soapbox in the public square', which was initially situated right next to the stocks if someone needed 'shaming'.

1786 2019-06-18 12:05:23 I'm longer than long $DXY.  As long as the economic situation I'm #Europe and the political situation in #England stay grim, USD and JPY are the place to be.  I also like MXN as an EM play. #FOREX #fx #investing #investment #NEWS #Stocks
1787 2019-06-18 12:04:33 Bitaw jud dai, wise mana sila basta bag-o ang stocks, dili jud mag butang ug price. pina enjoy pakog pili2, pag pangutanag tagpila ay akong gipangbalik akong gikuha oy 
1788 2019-06-18 12:04:02 Hi, so if I go to my local store they can order it from central stocks? Thanks
1789 2019-06-18 12:03:48 What if the Fed disappoints tomorrow, the front end sells off, dollar rallies, commodities, EMs, and stocks tank, and the back end ends the day up.

1791 2019-06-18 12:02:35 Bodega cat also stocks goods for friends of canines too.
1792 2019-06-18 12:02:19 But they cannot stop daffy donald from shorting stocks and making millions on the drops he causes by his comments! The music not the words!
1793 2019-06-18 12:02:18 Sa lahat ng bagay na nagpapatibok ng puso ko, masasabi kong stocks trading lang yung tanging bagay na kahit 3 days na kong di natutulog basta may magtatanong willing akong kumausap. 
1794 2019-06-18 12:01:52 Zuckerberg: stocks not doing well? Let's steal another idea.
1795 2019-06-18 12:00:58 Lol....and EU bank stocks dont look so cheery
1796 2019-06-18 12:00:31 Scrap them S stocks xp
1797 2019-06-18 11:59:48 **European stocks wave forlornly from sidelines**
1798 2019-06-18 11:59:47 Stocks futures went  up & you complaining ? Whats this whats this? Your miracle market driven by factors out side of your control. last nights trade going to create losses for the family? How will you weaken the dollar now to offset this?
1799 2019-06-18 11:59:43 Thankful heart  . Can you do another thread on stocks. How to buy stocks and the way to go. Advices you can share
1800 2019-06-18 11:58:31 You're right JP Morgan isn't that would be big pharma and insurance companies not are paying to stop M4A only thing JP Morgan would care about is the stocks in those companies. Did you ever see the Major General Smedley Butler in 1933 JP Morgan & others tried to coup FDR
1801 2019-06-18 11:58:30 Village stocks
1802 2019-06-18 11:58:17 So in conclusion, Hanbin brought money to yg and when yg dropped him, no doubt his stocks will drop. Well, they just threw out their diamonds.

1804 2019-06-18 11:55:49 ...but I can tell you that these two tech stocks are are only ones you need to own and are underpriced right now.
1805 2019-06-18 11:55:48 It has been a while. Their stocks must getting low.
1806 2019-06-18 11:55:31 We don't have an expected timeframe for when this maintenance will be complete, but we're happy to let you know once you can transfer stocks into Robinhood again.
1807 2019-06-18 11:55:21 No; there is no correlation between my stocks portfolio/hedging and the long 2-yr Treasury position I put on after yield curve inversions.

When the yield curve inverts, the Fed cuts the Fed Funds Rate aggressively (to prevent a recession) and this pushes down rates....
1808 2019-06-18 11:54:48 Just what we expect to see: 
Stocks up on expected cuts. 
Gold up for the same reason.
Oil down on growth worries.
1809 2019-06-18 11:54:39 more cheap stocks for Carmine. ;-)
1810 2019-06-18 11:54:26 Stocks about to Pop!
1811 2019-06-18 11:54:23 Be an adult and stop complaining. You're a laughing stocks for people around the world. Shameful that we have a 73 year old toddler as president.
1812 2019-06-18 11:54:03 C'est exactement ce qu'ils planifient les États occidentaux en particulier la France. Si non pourquoi pourquoi fabriquer de nouvelles armes pendant qu'il en existe des stocks interminables.
La paix ne se construit avec les armes je suis désolé.
1813 2019-06-18 11:52:44 Haven’t been on my stocks in a while. I need to get back and stop losing money
1814 2019-06-18 11:52:41 CAP is not perfect but necessary.
CFP has done fish stocks good as well as the fish trade for the UK.
EU  has trade deals that  have taken decades to create which the UK benefit from.
The Uk will not be the UK if we Brexit.
The broken up UK will not be able to compete with the EU
1815 2019-06-18 11:52:27 Naik terus sih meski ga signfikan kayak stocks gitu. Tapi RD tuh kek gaperlu pantengin yang ngecheck terus kayak stocks gitu hahaha.
1816 2019-06-18 11:52:00 I’m getting an extra 3% back on my income tax rate. Meaning I get to keep more of the money I work for. That alone is enough for me. Prison reform, union representation, banned bump stocks, created millions of new jobs lowest unemployment rate since 2000.

1829 2019-06-18 11:46:19 Looking forward to his comments on moves in individual stocks with charts, entry/exit points with stop losses.
1830 2019-06-18 11:46:18 Thanks for the advice and follow. Been studying your method along with what I have used trading stocks for the last ten years. So the pump to 78 cent back in late September last year is that classed as the first pump of the three we are hoping to achieve ?
1831 2019-06-18 11:45:24 The good news is large corporations have a lot of cash to both invest in capital expenditures and spend money on buybacks. The former will be supportive for stocks in the long term, while the latter will keep boosting prices in the short term.

1834 2019-06-18 11:44:58 Sir, please correct me if I am wrong, this chart showsSignificance of nifty top 10 stocks.
1835 2019-06-18 11:44:55 Seems to me its always very risky to short low float stocks.
1836 2019-06-18 11:44:50 Stocks and commodities
1837 2019-06-18 11:44:26 Looking forward to comments on daily moves on individual stocks. Why $MDGL is not taken over yet? Are SaaS stocks overvalued or do we get a pullback to load up? Where are the bottoms for Energy stocks? I will appreciate any chart with entry/exit points.
1838 2019-06-18 11:44:25 This will be the best Christmas ever.  $ TTCM and $VRUS.   These two stocks alone will make it wonderful.

1845 2019-06-18 11:39:59 Stocks UP; bonds UP; dollar UP; gold UP.

Something here doesn't add UP.
1846 2019-06-18 11:39:32 Stocks in Asia traded higher Tuesday (except for Japan) as investors continue to position around a dovish central bank outlook set against slowing global growth.

1848 2019-06-18 11:38:17 Only 54% stocks represent 53.5% of holdings for U.S. households, above the 44.8% norm since 1952, according to Davis. Meanwhile, cash and bond holdings have decreased, with cash at 24.7%, compared with an average of 32.2%, and bonds presently at 21.8% versus an average of 23%
1849 2019-06-18 11:37:31 No they wont? you seriously believe that companies like tesla shell construction(like me) are gonna use a facebook coin to pay their bills and workers warren buffet investing in stocks with a facebookcoin?
1850 2019-06-18 11:36:30 Stocks, real estate, crypto currencies, ... will continue to make new highs in this environment imo
1851 2019-06-18 11:36:24 Over last 6 years i saw many self styled experts recommend many stocks with variety of stories and self reasoning which have turned out to be not true or largely inflated . What most of them failed to build into their models (in my view) is the impact of changing
1852 2019-06-18 11:35:53 J'ai plus d'actions dans les stocks de mouchoirs 
1853 2019-06-18 11:35:03 I get that... but the truth is, global stocks/use currently sit at around the levels last seen in 2012/2013. Sure, the US Dollar is stronger and exports are down, but the market remains complacent of the risk that we draw US ending stocks below a billion even with a demand hit

1856 2019-06-18 11:33:11 Inflation, UE, Growth, credit spreads, stocks etc none of that matters maybe this whole rate cut pricing shit is actually about the USD strength.
1857 2019-06-18 11:32:31 Why do people assume a sharp rise in stocks in caused by a "short squeeze?" Where is the short squeeze in $AAOI? Where is the short squeeze in $SYNA, $SFIX? It's amatuerish to assume $BYND is up merely because of a short squeeze.

1860 2019-06-18 11:31:47 My dear, poor public doesn’t care who is the global leader in stocks.. their concern is 7% rise in inflation, massive taxation & unemployments... so just don’t talk numbers here.. all Corporate economists delude with numbers & fudge... Economy is “Per Capita Growth”..
1861 2019-06-18 11:31:38 Everyone in the world is turning 80 and rates are going negative. Underweight stocks the new normal...?
1862 2019-06-18 11:31:08 I bet $TLRY runs today as $BYND almost hits 200 premarket... 

Not a related sector but there will be a lot of chatter comparing the two supernova stocks

1867 2019-06-18 11:29:34 So take those soil C stocks. Multiply that by 3.67 to get to tonnes CO2 as per carbon accounting.

Say 100t C / ha. So 367t CO2 equivalents as a store. That's against 5t CO2e/ha emissions from say a sheep & beef farm. That's using GWP100. If you applied GWP* calculation
1868 2019-06-18 11:29:08 You topple the US stock market with your comments making millions on shorted stocks but they all turn the other way! You are truly a traitor at every turn!

1877 2019-06-18 11:24:35 Hmmm looks like we might see the stocks gap up a bit :-)
1878 2019-06-18 11:24:25 I’m sure our markets will open and crash in two hours after your words of wisdom. Did you secretly tell your douchebag kid to short the major stocks today? Can’t wait until the stock fraud scheme is uncovered by the #SDNY
1879 2019-06-18 11:23:55 So did US Futures and that is very unfair because US stocks are in a "big fat ugly bubble" (D.J. Trump, September 2016)

1883 2019-06-18 11:21:52 We used to be under the impression that we could reap profits like anything through cheap stocks..
Good lesson learnt!

1884 2019-06-18 11:21:43 @MartinSLewis My Stocks ISA provider is raising prices. My option is to either move to another provider (by paying a transfer-out fee of £25) or accept the new prices. Do I have a legal reason to not pay the Exit-fee (or transfer-out fee)?
1885 2019-06-18 11:21:28 They raised their wages but took out monthly bonuses and the stocks they used to give employees. Which basically means the workers earn the same if not a little less because of the "raise"
1886 2019-06-18 11:21:04 I’ve come to terms with my body (post babies) and don’t really aspire for thinness. But I do resent the fashion/clothes industry trying to make me feel shit by being completely inconsistent with sizing and trying to shame women out of certain brands (sportswear in particular)
1887 2019-06-18 11:19:20 Bond yield falling and stocks falling that is equity earnings yield going up. The equity case becomes better the more markets and yields falls.

1890 2019-06-18 11:17:35 I know, but interesting how stocks that are beaten down (like Auto presently) aren't talked about as Value but stocks that are at All time Highs
1891 2019-06-18 11:17:26 Global stocks and bonds jumped, while the euro tumbled as Draghi's comments added fuel to investors' hopes for easier monetary policies from the world's biggest central banks.  Treasuries rallied with gold and the yen. The dollar edged up. Oil dropped.
1892 2019-06-18 11:17:09 Apple has become a celebrity phone in last two years mate they loosing their value and stocks after Chinese hitting back to us in tarrif wars
1893 2019-06-18 11:17:00 The most feminist thing you can do is to live unapologeticly in your body, treating it well and doing what makes you feel healthy. Thinness is about women's compliance. Be strong, be healthy and remember the world is privileged to have you.
1894 2019-06-18 11:16:46 Cant say if it will or not....chart certainly is a falling knife... i wont be surprised if it does.... more than what ever funda view etc, these stocks are likely overowned and being averaged...until the mkt removes the last standing bull, it wont stop. thats how mkts work.
1895 2019-06-18 11:16:09 Well.. at least $BYND is making all of my SaaS/Tech stocks look like value stocks. 

I have no position in @BeyondMeat so no Skin in The Game on this one, but I can’t help but feel a lot of people are going to get burned and this could be a bad sign about overall euphoria..
1896 2019-06-18 11:15:43 Sir,,,why most of the stocks trading at Discount in july futures,,,
1897 2019-06-18 11:15:23 U.S. stocks were higher Monday & futures were trending higher on Tuesday, as more investors & analysts project the U.S. Federal Reserve is likely to initiate an interest rate cut as early as July.
1898 2019-06-18 11:14:44 Why have stocks been rising in a very strong V shape since December? Why are stocks rising today? All and only because the market participants believe the Fed will bail them out with cheap money, rate cuts and QE. It's a disgusting investment thesis.
1899 2019-06-18 11:12:43 Another way for @facebook to track everything it's users do and than sell it for big $$$ and violate their privacy. problem is that @Visa @Uber and @Mastercard are now part of this corporate dystopia. #Crypto #cryptocurrency #bitcoin #investing #dystopian #Stocks #NEWS

1911 2019-06-18 11:03:29 I heard somewhere atleast 30 stocks are coming out from Fno next month. Is DHFL also ?
1912 2019-06-18 11:01:55 The market now thinks the likelihood of a cut is 25% tomorrow, 85% in July, both way up from recent weeks.

Cutting now is BS, only meant to keep stocks higher, and that's not the Fed's job. But it's 2019, so

1919 2019-06-18 10:57:13 So what you’re basically saying is stocks are finally ready to break out after a year and a half of wheel spinning?
1920 2019-06-18 10:55:23 Mentioned midcap stocks were in hurry to close their setups..
1921 2019-06-18 10:54:39 Yes i too checked Maruti , we should give higher stop loss for volatility stocks . The thing is these stocks can move 20 to 30 points or more  in  3 to 5 minutes range . tighten stop loss always hit the stop loss .

The answer is yes. It seems like another false flag (FF) attack to stop Trump's momentum and make the NRA suffer.

1936 2019-06-18 10:47:17 SINTRA, Portugal -- European Central Bank President Mario Draghi signaled Tuesday that the bank could cut interest rates or expand its giant bond-buying program as soon as its next policy meeting in July, sending stocks higher and the euro lower against the dollar.
1937 2019-06-18 10:47:15 What good suggestions.  Stocks would be good too.  Nothing quite like name and shame in as you say perhaps a pink boiler suit with arrows on it. Easy to spot with their expensive trainers with their "idols" just making more and more money causing resentment and death.

What was the correlation of S&P performance and QEs 1,2&3?
1942 2019-06-18 10:40:18 Sometimes I wonder what the phrase "markets demand" means.

Considering that a couple of billionaires own most stocks and everything else... Is it not just "billionaires demand"? And is it surprising that they want policies that pump money into equities?
1943 2019-06-18 10:39:55 Most Floating Stocks since the price of Rs. 25 (2015-16) is SAID TO BE "tightly held" by Operators & their crony associates: individuals as well as Shell Companies … so until they decide to sell aggressively … it may NOT COME DOWN !!!

1956 2019-06-18 10:32:18 Bloomberg is not talking about TARP.  They are talking about QE and other matters that were also part of the bailout.  Since the Fed received prefered stocks and those stocks made money, that's another dead end argument for you.
1957 2019-06-18 10:31:53 Thanks for this! Was actually looking at something very similar a few weeks back that my broker sent me. I sold some of my other stocks to invest into you guys a while back now. Im really glad I did, too!

1960 2019-06-18 10:31:06 Well, depends on how old school you wanna get? But there are a bunch of U.S based value ETFs or ETFs that track companies which exhibit the characteristics of Value stocks or value investing. Look at Vanguard, iShares by BlackRock or ProShares to name a few

1966 2019-06-18 10:28:46 No it went into buying back stocks. The reinvestment is only going to work if we have the demand. If 1st time home buying is lowest ever, cars purchase down, if farmers aren't exporting at levels they once did =less demand. Saudi gets U.S. weapons factory won't end well

1981 2019-06-18 10:13:10 The floating rate is based on the volatility of the underlying assets (bonds, fiat currencies).
They won't be buying any crypto, stocks or real estate with the money they raise(d).

I believe the floating rate will be low, but Libra will depreciate together with fiat currencies.
1982 2019-06-18 10:12:29 The issue I have with these surveys. Is if you go back, every time these things “collapse” it was a great time to buy stocks.

2031 2019-06-18 09:35:01 I was surprised that my BMI wasn’t overweight to be honest. I’m quite muscly and apparently BMI isn’t accurate for the short or very tall, normally Barry and I don’t come off well with it! 

Weighed myself after a run though so probably just dehydrated

2175 2019-06-18 08:15:59 Our oceans *are* overexploited, but lumping overfished (33% of stocks; #FAO) with maximally/sustainably fished (60%) gives oxygen to critics who say the NGO community exaggerates the issue. The facts are scary enough, particularly because #overfishing affects the most vulnerable.

2180 2019-06-18 08:13:55 C'est pas Nintendo qui demande à la fnac/amazon/micromania d'arrêter la vente et la relancer. 2 possibilités, soit les revendeurs jouent avec leurs stocks (très possible, la fnac est spécialiste), ou ils remettent juste en vente les annulations de préco.
2181 2019-06-18 08:13:13 I think that doesn't credit their edgeguarding enough. I do agree they're not as good at sealing stocks as other characters though (something I've been flamed for a lot lol) but I still think they're usually safe enough to squeeze a kill out without too much trouble
2182 2019-06-18 08:13:01 With global Central Banks on fire and a record cycle underweight position in stocks and an overweight position in defensives assets, I would barely be staying too short in markets

Time for those convicted of a slap to get a slap in return.

Bring back the stocks

No, we do not ship our plastic outside the UK. Our recycling is dealt with by re3 and 100% of plastic collected from Reading, Bracknell and Wokingham council is fully processed here in the UK to the feed stocks for packing companies.
2191 2019-06-18 08:06:33 It also depends on which brand of Yerba you buy. My local store only stocks Cruz de Malta and sometimes the orange flavored one as well. You can also throw in sugar or even a little coffee. In parts of Uruguay, they also drink it out of a hollowed-out orange.
2192 2019-06-18 08:05:34 Very interesting, But I think post those high % day my first guess is Nifty 10 stocks did better than midcap/small cap which fell 50-80% (going to chk on it!) But looks like a great market top indicator

2216 2019-06-18 07:42:45 Agree. People don't seem to understand that central bankers by themselves do not have the power to lift valuations. That power comes from willing participants buying up all the bloated stocks, NIRP bonds, or whatever, and they tend to be much less willing in a recession.
2217 2019-06-18 07:41:45 My basic "sniff test" for such stocks is simple - would i take a home loan from (say) HDFC or DHFL ?

2218 2019-06-18 07:41:40 Greed is hurting investors, with not clear picture about re-start, income etc., still people are buying stocks. Pure speculation and gamble. How can any common investor with hard earned money invest in such stocks? #investing #investment #WealthManagement #StockMarket

2233 2019-06-18 07:23:50 $MIN Share price has remained strong this year solely on Iron Ore production and bullish prices. Elsewise they would have followed all the lithium stocks down earlier on. They are currently playing catch up and in a downtrend as we speak.

2236 2019-06-18 07:21:26 The market is a pendulum that forever swings between unsustainable optimism (which makes stocks too expensive) and unjustified pessimism (which makes them too cheap). The intelligent investor is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists.

SA markets closed in the red on Friday, pulled down by broad based losses in resources and platinum sector stocks. 
What to watch today
2249 2019-06-18 07:03:35 I will be joining @Ross_Greenwood tonight on @MoneyNewsShow @2gb873 (Channel 873AM) tonight at 7.45pm to discuss markets and stocks.
2250 2019-06-18 07:03:04 Expert Advice- #Nifty gave a strong break below important support of 11770 on closing basis. Momentum looks to be building on the downside and 11845 would now act as a crucial resistance. Avoid catching a falling knife and ride the crash exactly as expected!

2270 2019-06-18 06:49:40 I wish I could buy stocks in people.  Like I know you’re not it rn but I believe in you, I think you’re gonna be soooo amazing, I’m gonna buy & hold. Or to the contrary, I know ppl think you’re great but I’m shorting you.
2271 2019-06-18 06:48:05 Concidently, gold keeps marching higher. Today, gold stocks were acting strong even with gold going lower. In contrast, the oil complex and transports have been acting weak. I think the market is starting to price in a stagflation scenerio up ahead!

2294 2019-06-18 06:24:47 Minimum wages are stagnant
Interest rates are falling
Job numbers are diminishing

That all adds up to a failing economic picture and the narrative is being manipulated. Stocks may run for another couple yrs but that doesn't mean you can ignore the fundamentals.

2307 2019-06-18 06:15:53 I checked today and the short rebate on BYND is 89% annualized! Long/short equity managers often sell short stocks that decline in value. That’s not enough to win, though. The stock prices need to decline in value enough to fully offset the cost of the borrow. High bar for BYND!

2396 2019-06-18 04:51:24 Some brokerage downgrade of consumption stocks when revival is just around the corner will give a good entry point to long term investors.
These are long term wealth creating stocks.

2407 2019-06-18 04:41:20 Rojava certainly does. Mondragon is a worker cooperative, which are socialist. Wealth funds are state control of the means of production (as stocks control boards of directors which control companies). Direct state ownership of housing, as in Singapore, is certainly socialist*.

2413 2019-06-18 04:34:22 It'a a sentiment issue and sets a bad precedent. Investors need to understand that debt is not risk free. In 2018 Indian govt had asked OMC to absorb minor hike in fuel price, the stocks of HPCL & BPCL tanked big time, even though the quantum of hike was insignificant.

Bulls should take this as a correction, this is not end of bull market. Corrections are for making profits or for deployment of money. 

A correction within a large bull market is healthy.

2519 2019-06-18 03:11:04 The fed can’t cut rates. Pension plans and all other fixed incomes can not handle it. With stocks at all time highs I put it at 5% for a cut.    If anything a hike is needed for bonds to play catch up after a decade of underperforming pensions.

2523 2019-06-18 03:06:47 Im not very good at catching momentum stocks just yet
2524 2019-06-18 03:05:38 Is it on the way now to bankcruptcy? Kawawa nman si Regine, may balat’ nga ba? I’ll not buy a stocks from gov’t critics, what for?

2526 2019-06-18 03:03:09 buying moneygram stocks is better than buying xrp who's founders dumping billions of xrp stopping it from going up. Xrp did nothing at all after the announcement. News did not reflect so much.
2527 2019-06-18 03:02:29 Stock ownership before 2008 was 62 percent, Gallup found. Even after recent inflows, only 54 percent of Americans are invested now. More adults in the United States own homes than stocks. So what about those without a 401k.
2528 2019-06-18 03:01:05 Good report.   But you left out her keeping stocks she had promised to sell.   Profiting of course off them.  And also her steering lots of cash to her hubbys state for  infrastructure projects.   Way above the norm.     She’s a ball of greed and blatant corruption.

2539 2019-06-18 02:56:00 Well I got to keep my stocks that were given to me, and so were everyone else who received some. Some people do like the predictability of the wage increase versus having that end of the month bonus. I also did find out that I am making almost $300 more after taxes.

2545 2019-06-18 02:51:38 Two sides of pendulum: how do you control your fear in bear market and greed in bull market matters a lot. While bear markets bring the opportunities for buying good stocks at lower price, bull market can mislead one to buy bad stocks at higher price.

2551 2019-06-18 02:39:36 one could speculate much of the short value between may 16th and june 1st is people shorting and covering with the pp shares.   There was a financial post article a while back on how that is prevelant in the weed stocks

2559 2019-06-18 02:34:40 I honestly think Falco is worse in Ultimate. He has the same bad neutral, his hard MU’s got even harder, and his recovery/disadvantage is worse. He still relies way too heavily on making a hard read for stocks. It also doesn’t help that his u-Smash and n-air don’t work.

2561 2019-06-18 02:33:31 I can listen to Pres all day. I work while listening -trade stocks, write emails, read & still understand every word, all concepts-you’re having a hard time why? Trump connects the dots, & makes sense! Obama muddied up everything with esoteric bullshit! It’s a beautiful thing!
2562 2019-06-18 02:32:15 This is how they always handle tax cuts. This is why you don’t give them tax cuts and why people were so pissed before it passed. It’s been the same thing since the 80s. Buy back stocks and lay off workers. Screw the workers pay the ceo & board members.
2563 2019-06-18 02:31:28 It reminds of the last great days of 1999 and early 2000 except there were a bunch of the #dot.com stocks trading like that.

2567 2019-06-18 02:26:07 98 what? Based on normal $BYND behavior, there will be a selloff and stocks will settle around $170... before creeping back up Wednesday ... it will hit $200 before July 4th.

2574 2019-06-18 02:21:28 Like the Vegas shooter that wasted hundreds of rounds using bump stocks, but killed less than 60 at the concert. It could have been much worse if he wasn't simply spraying the crowd.
2575 2019-06-18 02:21:23 Seriously making guns illegal is not gonna fucking help the issue. In fact it’s gonna make it even worse in the black market cause those guns are non traceable automatic and has bump stocks. Or maybe since I’m not a government official my opinion doesn’t matter
2576 2019-06-18 02:20:45 well.. I bought the stock when it was $80.. now it’s $160 or so.. so that’s a good investment. just don’t know when it will cap. and also.. don’t spend money in stocks that you can’t lose

2582 2019-06-18 02:18:21 "Member B.I (Kim Han Bin) is also a main source of revenue for the label." 
ooohHh yes, that's why yge stocks suddenly fall down, they just lost their gem what do yall expect hun
2583 2019-06-18 02:17:08 Even if true, that is still irrelevant to my argument that stocks have not fared as well you claim during the past year.   These reports go through the same level of scrutiny and again, easily verifiable, no latter if reports came from Democrats.
2584 2019-06-18 02:17:07 They're going to have a 'kudatah' don't you know!  If Cangal's delusional assertions had any merit stocks in popcorn would go through the roof.
2585 2019-06-18 02:16:25 Ironic that for all the hate for $XRP because of its infinite supply are the ones trading stocks based on a fiat currency which literally dilutes itself into oblivion and if thought about rationally for more than a few seconds: also has an infinute supply.
2586 2019-06-18 02:15:29 The real issue is how they steal retirement plans from ppl they stomgfullg fire, how they use power to force out ppl over 45, how they only give stocks to directors and above, and how they outsource just to get ppl off the payroll. Outsourcing is not always bad.

2593 2019-06-18 02:09:59 Wall St is code for the rampant financialization of industries. Think private equity and hedge funds, not trading stocks.

Im gonna do a "combo". I will be selling some(not all), and its gonna be in stages, depending on the price.

2602 2019-06-18 02:00:28 $JUNE 17 - Powell said the central bank would act as appropriate to sustain US economic growth. Markets took that to mean that an interest rate cut was imminent. By signaling rate cuts are coming, Powell could add more fuel to this fire, which would probably send stocks higher.

2606 2019-06-18 01:53:21 Stock price in 2009 was also during the Great Recession. In hindsight, I wish I would’ve spent less time with @JD_Jerbear playing NHL 09 in our apartment and more time buying once in a lifetime discounts on blue chip stocks

2609 2019-06-18 01:52:24 Fed's Powell is sure to have some benami account in the Caribbeans FX-ed short sale of his tech stocks just before he went intelligently dumb!
2610 2019-06-18 01:51:26 I always thought it depends.  some stocks are and some stocks are not.  I thought I read somewhere that transportation stocks are usually leading indicators.
2611 2019-06-18 01:50:52 I'm sure with that child support, the mother can find someone to make believe they are the daddy. fuck it. take your money, open a trust find, invest in some "fixed" stocks and get it over with.
2612 2019-06-18 01:48:59 when you have stay rich money...you dont need stocks..not speaking from personal experience tho
2613 2019-06-18 01:48:53 Regrettably, the IPAcalypse swept through American microbrewers with astounding force many years ago and we still haven't fully recovered. If you're in or near North Carolina, check if your local bottle shop stocks Railhouse; they make dark, malty beers almost exclusively.
2614 2019-06-18 01:48:25 I never said the public gets anything from it. I'm saying if public people own the stocks, which is included in the market cap, this means the company doesn't own it. therefore saying a company is worth X means the company doesn't actually have X.
2615 2019-06-18 01:46:35 I'm a little mac man cuz whenever I win as him that mean I straight out played you for 3 stocks. 

No gimmicks. No cheap shit. No OP shit. Just straight out played.
2616 2019-06-18 01:45:43 @realDonaldTrump SIR! The Second Amendment was quite clear in its intent. Please, support it. In full, no exceptions. Criminals want to make noise when they, oh, rob a bank, commit a drive by, etc. Suppressors are hearing protection, bump stocks are wasteful. Only an accessory.
2617 2019-06-18 01:45:21 So the party that wants to turn us into Venezuela isn't a menace? Your survival food stocks must be quite extensive.
2618 2019-06-18 01:45:12 oof, i think i found out why, still not sure what Ness was doing though tbh, don't think he needed 2 stocks
2619 2019-06-18 01:45:01 I get what you’re saying regarding the USE of XRP, but saying you “made big money off stocks” and at the same time frowning on speculation is a bit contradictory... the early days of the tech boom were filled with speculation too. Come on man, be real.
2620 2019-06-18 01:44:04 Selling all my blue apron stocks while they was up for the short time being paid off cus look at them now
2621 2019-06-18 01:43:27 Booked profits on $REGI today. There is still enough short interest to press it higher. In this market environment I am  looking for singles and doubles on stocks and then back to cash looking for the next #contrariantrade
2622 2019-06-18 01:43:27 Majority of his “money” is stocks. 
Alternatively, how about you take home less pay and give some to an amazon worker.
2623 2019-06-18 01:42:48 That's a fair statement, and I was there too. I see this because, as a coin system allows entities to issue their own equity tokens (coins, stocks, etc) then the value-hold will shift to a more direct method. Thereby making crypto exchanges the new "stock market". Thoughts?
2624 2019-06-18 01:42:46 they are now selling stocks inmarijuana
2625 2019-06-18 01:41:08 Correction: I can’t directly own stocks per my NBC contract.  My investments are made for me.  I do, however. Have a Charitable Trust.
2626 2019-06-18 01:40:35 You don’t own stocks? What next, the Hamburgler doesn’t steal hamburgers? Flo doesn’t have insurance?
2627 2019-06-18 01:40:03 The headline is a bit misleading. My take away was u have to pick ur battles (like everything in life) when it comes to divestments of certain “sin stocks” if u ALSO expect a high ROI. The article didn’t make a strong argument that this was a silver bullet to CALPERS  woes.
2628 2019-06-18 01:39:58 And y’all don’t believe that iKON are the 2nd money maker of yg after Big Bang, and keeps insisting that once .... makes a comeback it will save yg and it’s stocks . Yikes.

2632 2019-06-18 01:37:56 CC I know you're an unwashed heathen who drives American sports cars and buys - stocks - gross - but on this point: 

"Trade the charts, not the news."

Broadly speaking, do you apply this to stock trading as well or is this a crypto attitude?
2633 2019-06-18 01:37:50 When they start beating war drums put your paycheck into weapons makers stocks. Right now overload the healthcare insurance stocks. Pharmaceutical stock? Put your whole family in it.
2634 2019-06-18 01:36:40 Yeah. Free enterprise works just great except for those it doesn’t work at all for. You know, working class Americans who don’t own stocks & bonds and who can’t afford a $400 emergency expense? Or who don’t have a cabinet member spouse to smooth the way for their personal greed?

2639 2019-06-18 01:33:39 History has shown that the stock market CAN rally for several months after inversions but those gains are NOT durable. 

The forward 3-yr return from stocks after inversions has been poor.
2640 2019-06-18 01:33:36 Yesterday JPM said RIL core earnings will degrow, today CLSA says this crude fall is unlike 2014 fall of & more similar to tht of 1997, 2001 & 2008 when crude fall was coupled with sharp crack in refining margins..Stocks to Watch: Indian Refiners
2641 2019-06-18 01:33:26 This does not even begin to touch on the economic bomb that would be dropped on retirement accounts / stock market. There is a reason most retirement portfolios are invested in the healthcare industry - it makes $$. People cannot divest stocks that are worthless, right econ guy?
2642 2019-06-18 01:32:10 Just because you disagree with the P/E ratio of a handful of stocks, that doesn’t mean we are in a “euphoric, let’s buy everything” environment. You can’t paint the market with that broad of a brush. That’s lazy.

2644 2019-06-18 01:29:10 Its not a loophole if it's in the tax code that you can take a deduction for certain business friendly things like reinvesting profit/writing off losses/amortizing assets/paying out via stocks. Loopholes and workarounds implies bad intent. What Amzn and other corps do is legal.

2646 2019-06-18 01:28:27 You are right; I'm not reducing exposure to stocks or selling anything - just riding the wave and will hedge when the time comes - not there yet.
2647 2019-06-18 01:28:20 I believe % relates to market price also...that would mean that some stocks look like they were dumped but in fact just lost some % because their price went down a lot during the week...comments?
2648 2019-06-18 01:27:44 Oooh how about the fact that they took stocks away when they added a $15 min wage 
2649 2019-06-18 01:26:01 Hahah!
If finance mattered, then why isn't it included in GDP?
Buying and selling stocks doesn't increase output of goods and services, it's merely ownership shares that if destroyed, wouldn't decrease material wealth.
Too, labor burdened with debt has decreased buying power.

2650 2019-06-18 01:25:15 They have a CC tomorrow. Penny stocks are funny. Folks will spends thousand for a chance of 100% a nickel is nothing in those terms.

2653 2019-06-18 01:24:07 If you don’t know where to start with trading stocks, the best thing to do is to utilize index funds. I suggest buying the S&P 500 once a month, utilizing “dollar-cost-averaging.”

2664 2019-06-18 01:11:29 Most investors buying real estate weigh those returns against other forms of investment. There's stocks and bonds. And also other places outside of NYC. Dissuading money from investing into old buildings may create unintended consequences for Tenants in the long-term.
2665 2019-06-18 01:11:11 That entire rise for Moneygram was after market hours today.

Even if the Fed cut interest rate this year the celebration will be short lived. You may not be able to exit, because when Market falls, it will fall like a knife and no one can catch a falling knife.

2684 2019-06-18 00:57:54 Amazon amd others play by the rules YOU SET FORTH! If you guys werent bought and sold like stocks, then maybe things would be different. You bail out companies,you subsidize others and you give them free Fed $ to buy back their own stocks. Change the rules! Change the tax code.
2685 2019-06-18 00:56:42 Yeah Ripply paid $4.1 for 10% of the stocks. Market was at $1.45... Ripple are seeing the bigger picture here. When XRP are going to the moon. This is just pocket change lol. Ripple are driving the crypto space to massadoption

2687 2019-06-18 00:55:50 US stocks rose on Monday as markets focused on an imminent meeting of the Federal Reserve rather than some surprisingly weak economic data.
2688 2019-06-18 00:55:50 My dad was really the only person in my family that could explain stocks to me WITH DETAIL... it wasn’t well the point of it is... we literally talked about ways to invest and in who.
2689 2019-06-18 00:55:29 Glad you got a good fill. We're all at the mercy of the market makers. There wasn't any significant news on any of our stocks. Things may get interesting post-Fed. Let me know if you have any questions.
2690 2019-06-18 00:54:58 There is a shit ton of us that were into tech and made big money off stocks like Google, Facebook and Apple.

Our generation of nerds killed it.

Not from speculation or hype... but from being wowed by using it. 

Use “crypto” to realize the XRP future. 

It’s that simple.

2695 2019-06-18 00:51:47 Sure....there were 4 projects rumored to be working with Facebook. 1. XLM who was first rumored in 2018 2. Link 3. Zilliqa and the 4th just paid $50M and warranted to buy stocks at triple the close market price  to get something going so I’ve eliminated that possibility

2697 2019-06-18 00:51:21 Research the golden ratio. The pattern exists all throughout nature, and actually is used to trade stocks (Fibonacci tool) which is interesting. A stock chart is just human emotion disguised as price (fear and greed).

2709 2019-06-18 00:46:11 Isn’t this true for lots of penny stocks too?
2710 2019-06-18 00:45:52 Actually, many factors led to the '83 Crash: oversaturation of consoles & games, computers being sold for the home that played games better, and investors moving their money from tech to energy stocks. Atari survived the E.T. bust until 1993.

2749 2019-06-18 00:16:31 An example of that is what the Frankfurt School, I think Habermas, called "colonization of the life world," a seepage of capitalism into every aspect of private life:  for ex a TV ad I saw for online stock trading that showed a baby in a crib trading stocks (adult voiceover).

2762 2019-06-18 00:00:17 How to Make Money in Stocks is the first finance / business / investing book I ever read. I switched from biochem to finance after I read it. It shaped the rest of my life. I can’t wait to listen to this. Thank you!
