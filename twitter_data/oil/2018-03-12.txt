If you have any mint tea, i think that is supposed to help. I often will use a drop or two of lavender oil on a cloth and put it nearby and it helps.

4 2018-03-12 23:59:19 Coconut oil changed my life
5 2018-03-12 23:59:10 Fair. I just think it can muddy the water. I see a lot of people saying "it wouldn't work in XYZ because we don't have lots of oil" but that isn't true for rest of Nordics. Obviously, most countries mess up natural resource windfalls, and that is clearly something Norway nailed.
6 2018-03-12 23:59:10 You are suggesting the entire oil sands would explode if there was an incident at a nearby refinery? 

There are already many upgraders and refineries near the source operating just fine and more on the way.
7 2018-03-12 23:59:00 Hehe, pan fried with olive oil 
8 2018-03-12 23:58:50 Yes! I’m now curious what oil slick colored dreads would look like. @IraynaTheMage rocked that color for awhile and it was beautiful!
9 2018-03-12 23:58:25 Im not really feeling like this guy is a person with reasonable credibility and something does not feel right about him....he has that slick Trump snake oil feel
10 2018-03-12 23:58:17 And you lost me at Vivian Krause. She's the Alex Jones of Canadian oil & gas. I've been hearing that I'm a "paid Protester" (by Soros) from her since Occupy in 2011. She's full of shit. She's in bed with Levant & Mike Duffy. #NiceTry #ProtectTheInlet

38 2018-03-12 23:57:55 I was responsible for someone else’s grossest thing. I brought homemade olive oil back from Tunisia in a Fanta bottle and my friend thought it was Fanta and mixed it into a cocktail on New Year’s Eve. The look on his face.

41 2018-03-12 23:57:23 or as wee in the house call them - Cajun style , no lol.

Learned it as a bairn , in lard then , but veggie now so sunflower oil.

Full heat 3-5 mins in depending on size , repeat in 10 , and again in 10.

Waitrose charge a mint for theirs , not a patch on mine though.

43 2018-03-12 23:57:06 Wonder if I put some wild growth hair oil on my brows will they get thicker.  I need my shit to be the perfect canvas for Sue.
44 2018-03-12 23:57:05 Oil is running out claims man making billions from it.
45 2018-03-12 23:57:03 If the oil beetles are Melodids, like in the Genus Meloe, they secrete cantharidin, which causes blistering in humans. If this is the case, the fly may be consuming the secretions as a secondary defense against predation?
46 2018-03-12 23:56:49 Yeah, they ran their most progressive candidate—Bernie Sanders. And then gave him the shaft. You’re defending people who consistently vote to protect banks, corps, insurers, big oil and accept their money. You can choose to be blind, but that’s reality.
47 2018-03-12 23:56:47 Someone should sue Schwarzenegger for using gas and oil products every day and using any electricity that comes from coal.
48 2018-03-12 23:56:32 Or brave fighters who have been defeating I.S, and the *actual* terrorists for over 3 years, liberated tens of thousands, destroyed their terror state, saved the world from more attacks... 

Whilst Turkey watched, aided and bought much oil off.

I'll choose the 'rats'.

50 2018-03-12 23:56:20 Fuck is this world full of hypocritical pieces of shit! So a garbage wanna be musician raps(craps) about violence with guns is saying shit about the NRA and Arnold Schwarzenidiot is whining about oil...boohoo you fucken has been! Come on San Andreas take care of Hollywood!
51 2018-03-12 23:56:11 No different than the crude oil narrative.  The 'oversupply' story is good, but didn't help you in the rise from $40 to $60.....
52 2018-03-12 23:56:03 Yea they treatments and that oil is the shit lol
53 2018-03-12 23:55:56 I think Tillerson would rather return to the oil business for one more chance to ride the gravy chain, before renewables take over.
54 2018-03-12 23:55:54 @AllisonLCarter serious question, any idea of why the @indystar didn't cover the Robotics State Championship over the weekend that was held at Lucus Oil? Both Mayor Hogsett and former Mayor Ballard where there. I just didn't see any articles when i searched the site
55 2018-03-12 23:55:41 OH NO I didn't know that... fuck peppermint oil! fuck it straight to Hades.... Salt sounds better anyways LOL

59 2018-03-12 23:54:52 castor oil has done wonders for my brows and lashes
60 2018-03-12 23:54:49 Something healthy.  A nicely seasoned chicken breast in the iron skillet along with sauteed peppers/onions and a roasted sweet potato (425 degrees in the over for 40min with some olive oil and spices on potatoes.  :)  Simply yet tasty meal.
61 2018-03-12 23:54:38 Crude...not bitumen

"In fact, according to Canadian National Railway Co., trains can move heavy oil far more efficiently than pipelines."

66 2018-03-12 23:54:05 I think its time we started looking elsewhere for trade deals. We need to start dealing with other countries too. Competition you know. Dont have all your eggs in one basket. Its all about the oil. As long as the US is our only customer they are happy.
67 2018-03-12 23:54:04 I’m officially one week away from my aptitude test for lubrizol oil and gas. I’m pretty confident, plus i got the cheat from my homie that’s on already

69 2018-03-12 23:53:59 Snake Oil !
70 2018-03-12 23:53:58 Honestly I'm not sure of an exact way lol just care for it more since I cut it. Especially in the beginning. Oil is my best friend for my scalp & ends. Most people have routines, but I just base it off of the feeling of my hair. Mainly natural products too.
71 2018-03-12 23:53:46 I’m pretty sure the message was no oil. Not by train or pipe or any other means. Renewable energy sources are necessary to survive and thrive
72 2018-03-12 23:53:35 You know nothing on how solar panels are created do you? O and the batteries to make electric cars. Yea it all has to be mined for with machines that run off diesel
and oil. Do you not realize mining and producing those things will cause more pollution? O wait you don't care!

78 2018-03-12 23:52:35 Before I wash my hair I always do a oil treatment. My hair be soft asf

86 2018-03-12 23:51:19 And yet the world energy demand for oil grows everyday. Do you dispute that as well?
87 2018-03-12 23:51:13 Whilst I am at it Jack , Devonport is a long way from Kansas Toto!!!  This is a serious continuing criminal problem for many many victorians. Devonport Mall doesn’t cut it mate as a demographic hub so grab another latte and paint an oil or right a poem or something
88 2018-03-12 23:51:00 I just bought this new oil for my dry ass hair and wooow I love it already.
89 2018-03-12 23:50:59 I also once confused my glass of cola with my glass of turpentine because it too was jet black from the oil paints dissolved in it.
90 2018-03-12 23:50:54 i'm also fundamentally confused as to why people are like "oh that's just oil wealth" as if oil wealth isn't real? surely the lesson here is that nationalizing natural endowments (like oil+gas, but also land) and putting the proceeds in a SWF is a really good idea
91 2018-03-12 23:50:41 @jkenney  says that's ethical oil...and if BC doesn't shut up the Pipe will never Get Finished and Bitumen will never get to the markets. Nothing wrong with Notley, and everything wrong with @PC_Alberta  remember those Ralph Kline Bucks, and Ed Stelmach and @Redford_Alison etc...
92 2018-03-12 23:50:28 Supplying oil is the crime, not burning it

103 2018-03-12 23:49:05 By buying their oil? If anything opposite seems to be true. Especially when you see meetings at U.N. Also U.S. Is basically a socialist country.

106 2018-03-12 23:49:02 You mean taxpayers in AB and BC pay for a refinery so Big Oil can rake in the dough? AB isn't getting much in royalties from some BigOil. If AB wants to build refineries in the tar sands they can pipe refined crude through existing pipelines.

113 2018-03-12 23:47:07 Oh, I just remembered a former co-worker had a mom who was a terrible cook, but he was super polite. Once she made a casserole using DISH SOAP instead of oil. Reader, he ate it. I can't remember if it made him sick.

123 2018-03-12 23:45:44 I think a lot of people have found an exciting new driver to support in @IndyCar this year. Looking forward to a strong showing from @SPMIndyCar @robertwickens and @Hinchtown (and their close cousin Fish and Chips)
124 2018-03-12 23:45:43 Dirtiest oil on the planet, carbon footprint is too high. We can't extract it & survive as a species. Personal reason: I work in BC's $15 billion a year tourism industry. Don't want to risk my own livelihood for the profits of a Texas corporation that was born out of ENRON.
125 2018-03-12 23:45:32  That’s odd! You got the oil and not a roller, right?

137 2018-03-12 23:44:08 I try to be chemical free and made diy moisturizer out of argan oil and lavender oil, cause the internet said it will heal your face and be so natural. After a couple of months i realized that even the natural oil companies are just businesses and lie to you to sell their shit.
138 2018-03-12 23:43:52 lol dark skin is only beautiful to y’all if it’s covered in oil 
139 2018-03-12 23:43:45 How long has it taken to come up with this conclusion? Of course The U.S. and other Oil Producers are Threatened by the Canadian Resource Sector! It’s not Rocket Science!! Question: What are Canadians going to do about it? #cdnpoli #canpoli
140 2018-03-12 23:43:44 You know I have no issue with pursuing alternative energy but you are a fool to shoot yourself in the foot by hamstringing fossil fuels which pay for everything. It should be developed alongside oil and the market would determine when it fully replaces the other.

151 2018-03-12 23:42:29 I make both mayonnaise and allioli with olive oil, so nope. Egg is the technical distinction. You can put garlic in mayonnaise, but you can't put egg in allioli. Because allioli is all-i-oli, literally garlic-and-oil.

He's put his life on the line for the sake of the greater good. He's got an impeccable history of telling the TRUTH. How ANYONE can be against exposing corruption is truly disturbing. Being wanted for questioning for unjust "crimes" does not equate to being guilty.

194 2018-03-12 23:38:30 @beardbrand What's the (total) percentage of essential oils in your beard oils and balms? I've heard more than 1% can hurt your skin. Is that per oil, or total? Not trying to steal your recipes, I've got my own. Just wondering about the concentration. #DIY #beardoil #beardbrand

206 2018-03-12 23:37:00 then, right after, i do a clay mask to rly suck up all that nasty oil and debris stuck inside my pores.
207 2018-03-12 23:36:59 Got some grapeseed oil and mixed in some lavender and eucalyptus essential oils. One of the best after shower moisturizers I've used. Put some water and tea tree oil in he same mix (different bottle) and now I have an all natural hair spray that almost stops itchy scalp.

210 2018-03-12 23:36:21 Hey #BC. if you don't want our oil. we should cut it off to you till you agree on the pipeline. I wish we could do that and then halt all royalty payments to you.. and Quebec for that matter. Then lets see how fast you agree on the pipeline.

Your imperialist cognitive framework totally undermines your feeble criticism attempt. 

You implicitly accept the US right to empire and just piously wish for a little less oppression of its subject peoples.

214 2018-03-12 23:35:49 Cars and trucks that don’t require oil aren’t a reality for the vast majority of canadian citizens. Green energy products take a long time to get to market. Eventually they will be great but that time isn’t now, and now is when we are losing money on oil that is t being sold

222 2018-03-12 23:34:41 We've still got oil?
223 2018-03-12 23:34:41 not use enough oil, or not fry long enough, or not enough onion. The point is you want to balance the tartness of the tomato with the sweetness of the onion. Once onion is translucent add ground cumin and coriander seeds. If you like, some bell peppers. Then add tomato & simmer
224 2018-03-12 23:34:38 It also has jalapeños in it. Fresh squeezed emon and olive oil is the dressing.

233 2018-03-12 23:33:37 I've been on board for years with getting as much as we can for our oil while demand is there in order to best pay for the upcoming necessary transition

235 2018-03-12 23:33:12 Made my parents an anniversary cake. (i was ten.) Discovered that Tupperware isn’t a great choice for measuring heated cooking oil.
236 2018-03-12 23:33:03 Made pooris. House now full of oil smoke. 
STILL WORTH IT.
237 2018-03-12 23:32:46 I like it roasted w a little olive oil and garlic, 400 degrees about 7-8 min (til just cooked but still firm).

240 2018-03-12 23:32:26 I have the dove exfoliating cream but I’m so obsessed with coconut oil and sugar I feel like the product won’t be the same
241 2018-03-12 23:32:06 Having a lavender essential oil helps, along with having some amethyst crystals. :) 
Or even having your favorite Tea with you.
242 2018-03-12 23:31:51 I put pure tea tree oil on my face on some “clear skin” shit, and now my face is sizzling and I think this is the end

244 2018-03-12 23:31:48 The sofrito sauce is onions and garlic, chopped and fried in plenty of oil (olive oil is nicest). 2 large or 3 medium onions per can of chopped tomatoes (you can use fresh). Frying the onion breaks down the carb chains and makes it sweeter. A common mistake is to (cont)
245 2018-03-12 23:31:48 Sure wish I had some bad press to dump, because today would be the day to do it.

Instead, I'm off to change the oil in my sled.
246 2018-03-12 23:31:36 Do this: grind 3 bunches fresh cilantro, 4 garlic cloves, 8 red birds eye chilis, juice of 1 lime, 1 t each ground cumin/cardamom/salt, 1/2 t black pepper, & 1/2 c olive oil in blender until smooth. Stir 3-5 T into 7 oz crumbled/cubed feta. Eat with pita chips.
247 2018-03-12 23:31:11 Well that was a disaster.  Decided to try frying some 75% lean 25% fat pre-pressed beef patties in butter instead of oil

Problem is the patties are about 4 months out of date and like cardboard

Opened a brand new package, we'll see how they do
248 2018-03-12 23:31:09 @Schwarzenegger so you are going to sue the oil companies. The guy who normalized driving humvee military vehicles as a commuter. Your brain is smaller than those steroids made your balls.

257 2018-03-12 23:30:17 Shale oil companies are much more productive than before. Currently wellhead average break-evens are around $40. Additionally prices have increased from $45 to $60. So, prices stable around $60, break-evens at $40 and strong world demand, that will change.

269 2018-03-12 23:28:21 Yes, it tasted pretty bad! I felt bad for disliking it, i wanted to like it, I tried it at a trade show and these super enthusiastic girls gave me a cricket brownie and I smiled and said yum and then spat it in the trash :( really bitter, like rancid oil

290 2018-03-12 23:24:52 I really didn’t do to work because I had to do a whole ass oil change, and replace a spark plug myself because my car was just stuck at my house 
291 2018-03-12 23:24:48 My boyfriend is very allergic to my favorite flower, so it's fun to know I own a small vial of oil which could kill him~

Now my cack has been on fire  for the last hour. Feck!
293 2018-03-12 23:24:29 Hey @craftsman, I’ve had my mower in storage for 4yrs due to being military. Now that I recently retired, I just gave it a oil, air filter & spark plug change. Started up on 1st pull! That deserves a new tool .

303 2018-03-12 23:22:30 My high school boyfriend and his friends made me participate in their game "close your eyes and open your mouth." They mercifully only gave me frozen coconut oil, but it had the texture of wax and I have an overactive gag reflex.

320 2018-03-12 23:20:24 You know, but you do not dare say so. You know because this stuff isn't used by mobsters to kill a Russian defector for shits and giggles. Stop making Oil deals for Exxon in Chad and get back to reality.
321 2018-03-12 23:20:16 ...no, but rail is considerably less safe than pipelines. Anti oil lobby groups funded by larger groups outside  have pushed their anti-pipeline agenda to hobble  energy industry...right now the primary benefactor is  as our oil becomes harder to sell elsewhere.

328 2018-03-12 23:19:56 @Schwarzenegger so you no longer fly, drive or use plastics? I'm assuming since you know the dangers of oil you no longer contribute to it's use?
329 2018-03-12 23:19:56 For preparation for the third major snow storm this month, I did some “spring cleaning” and dusted with @younglivingeo Thieves essential oil wipes. Everything is clean and smells like cinnamon and clove and nothing hurts 
330 2018-03-12 23:19:44 It's kind of boring, but I've had several incidents with "woody breast"ed chicken, usually when it's cooked in oil, where it was just like chunk rubber

The texture just ruins me

337 2018-03-12 23:18:43 Porque el combustible era accesible , el gas oil estaba lejísimo de la nafta , te acordas las adaptaciones a Diésel ? La nafta casi no se vendía , porque vas a importar sino afectaba el bolsillo como lo afecta hoy ?

339 2018-03-12 23:18:17 India  raised import  duty for the 4 time in 6 months  on crude and refined palm oil to a ten-year high to support domestic producers.
Import duty was increased from 30% to 44% for crude palm oil and from 40% to 54% for refined oil.

347 2018-03-12 23:16:55 My mom is just the opposite. She’s all about the butter & oil. She calls my penchant for organic vegan substitutes “blasphemy” or “haram.”
348 2018-03-12 23:16:53 I can change the fluid in both differentials faster than the dealership can do an “express” oil change.
349 2018-03-12 23:16:40 My grandma was a legendarily bad cook. Her most famous offense: she once started baking a cake and realized she didn’t have any vegetable oil, so she substituted it with strained fish grease leftover from dinner the night before.

352 2018-03-12 23:16:03 I have been using Bee’s Wraps instead of plastic wrap or sandwich bags. The organic cotton is coated with jojoba oil and beeswax with natural tree resins that allows the wraps to be reused after a gentle wash in the sink! #es161
353 2018-03-12 23:15:56 More slightly different oil is hardly diversification. I expected better.
354 2018-03-12 23:15:38 The partisanship Is breathtaking.  If you believe them, I have some snake oil I’ll sell you.
355 2018-03-12 23:15:38 He’s wanted for questioning in association with crimes in at least two nations. If he believes in Justice, as he claims, he’d face it fearlessly. But he’s selling snake oil like nearly everyone else.

364 2018-03-12 23:14:50 Did you not read the blog post? Absent the pipeline we will see the same number of tankers in our waters, only they will be less regulated tankers on the American side of the border....it sure is lucky that oil spills don't cross international marine borders
365 2018-03-12 23:14:45 Oil money
366 2018-03-12 23:14:43 Haha, my mum keeps trying that sort of thing—quinoa in tabbouli, frying onions in coconut oil—& my dad is NOT having it.
367 2018-03-12 23:14:41 Amb @NikkiHaley on possible US and #DPRK summit: "if you think about it, three resolutions were passed in the UN unanimously by the SC that cut off all exports, 90% of trade, 30% of oil, disband of their labor pool. All of those things led to the pressure that amounted to this."
368 2018-03-12 23:14:27 So you actually think the people who take 92% of oil and gas wealth need to bail scots out 13BN PER YEAR for bugger all back!,are you fucrkin mental?
These people brought you bedroom tax and killing disabled to save3 BN
Why so generous to scots then Kenneth,,,is it love?
369 2018-03-12 23:14:14 Needed an oil change..... Badly #procrastination

385 2018-03-12 23:12:34 Because they need to offload. They are planning of running exclusively on electricity. The US has Oil in their storage that could last them 100 year without scarcity even if the whole world turned against them. Wise up Nigeria.

417 2018-03-12 23:07:32 Putin veto of Romney for his hand picked guy is treason by Trump. Trump had never met Tillerson before considering him for SOS. Stunning control of U.S. leadership by Putin, who hated Hillary & Romney. U.S./Russia oil possibilities also big factor.

436 2018-03-12 23:04:56 Keeps An Oil Slick Out Of The Candy! What A Toxic Greaseball!
437 2018-03-12 23:04:42 I drank 8 oz of Wesson oil once because it was dark in the kitchen and I thought it was the white cranberry juice my mom had bought earlier, but at least it was "fresh" from the bottle and not used oil.
438 2018-03-12 23:04:39 Has anyone asked Garneau how he squares barges of oil products towed up the inside passage in BC with banning double hulled, professional crewed and piloted tankers with attendant tugs. Why is the barge legal and the tanker going to be banned.
439 2018-03-12 23:04:30 Coconut oil is my bff
440 2018-03-12 23:04:23 @realDonaldTrump Saudi Arabia owns our major oil refineries and has them tooled up to refined SA oil, not USA. How about some tariffs on that? Plus they're buying all the water rights in California they can get. Needs addressed. #MAGA.
441 2018-03-12 23:04:05 Vlad said so. That's why. Russian oil deal and Vlad wants his man on the job.
442 2018-03-12 23:03:55 I noticed witch hazel works to control the oil, use a soap free cleanser. I use Argan oil on my skin when it’s dry.
443 2018-03-12 23:03:51 Can add moar healthy fats. Nuts, avocado, olive oil, fish oil etc.  They are calorie dense n will give a boost in overall calories, which is typically helpful for breaking through plateaus.
444 2018-03-12 23:03:42 So Trudeau tells aluminum & steel workers in Quebec that he has their.  God knows he sure didn't & does not have backs of Oil & Gas workers in Sask & Alberta!  Then again Liberals have never cared about rural people or the West.
445 2018-03-12 23:03:31 I coated them in a thin layer of olive oil and baked them for 40 mins, 20 each side
446 2018-03-12 23:03:30 It’s just a straw to suck oil out for other countries, all Canadian resources have been privatized and sold to foreigners
447 2018-03-12 23:03:22 If you're going to use the neowhatever leave tea tree oil and get a really good moisturizer since it dries your skin. And whatever you're using give it time to work. Cus I know you. 
448 2018-03-12 23:03:21 When I asked Pepe Romero how he takes care of his hands so they're in good shape to play guitar: “Use a little hand cream at night, put good olive oil on your salads, drink a lot of red wine, and above all be happy.”
449 2018-03-12 23:03:16 Did I hear right, he doesn’t want to get into politics?
So it was ok to get involved in 2014 and tell copious lies about how the oil was running out. 
My parents voted No then, but then won’t again especially as oil is due to last another 75 years
450 2018-03-12 23:03:06 Oh lord. I want my nose pierced but I’m scared. Try some tea tree oil on it
451 2018-03-12 23:03:00 ง่วงเว้ยยย
452 2018-03-12 23:02:47 With Arnie suing oil companies for global warming it may be that he slipped on a few too many banana peels.
453 2018-03-12 23:02:44 Sounds like you arabs and Turks prefer ISIS jihadis occupying lands and oil fields .SIS attacked Kurds who fought back and that area hapened to have oil fields.Just remember Bashar when Kurds surounded Raqa used the opportunity to attack and capture the oil fields south of Raqa

464 2018-03-12 23:01:02 It can be purely financial. Suppose Alice offers to buy X oil for Y gold from Bob. She can cancel her offer at any time before Bob agrees. As soon as Bob agrees, she needs to hedge her position.

471 2018-03-12 23:00:07 My sister once made scrambled eggs, fried in what she thought was oil, but was in fact yellow washing-up liquid. We all ate the whole thing out of politeness, not finding out til later.

473 2018-03-12 22:59:49 Not getting involved in politics now Mr Wood since we are not running out of oil after all

478 2018-03-12 22:59:13 the car turns out on when heating so that your car uses more petrol and supports the oil industry
479 2018-03-12 22:58:58 One single Canadian? I'm sorry but Alberta's prosperity relies on our oil and gas industry. There's a reason there's 175 000 Albertans unemployed right now because the NDP have been killing the economy. If we don't stand up for oil and gas, Albertans will continue to suffer.
480 2018-03-12 22:58:32 Brock is right. AB has given more money to confederation than most provinces opposing the pipeline that benefit directly from AB money. Canadian oil is developed responsibly and safely, unlike oil imported from conflict regimes with awful human  rights records.

In their last 10 games, the Oilers PK is 24/26 (92.3%) 2nd best in NHL over that span.

The powerplay is exactly 20%

Oil are 6-4 in that span.
483 2018-03-12 22:57:56 That’s never going to happen.

Europe needs Russia’s oil.
484 2018-03-12 22:57:25 @iancollinsuk @lbc if we hadn’t of closed all of our coal mines we wouldn’t have to rely on Russian oil & gas
485 2018-03-12 22:57:24 I am all for the free market as long as I get to decide what province we sell oil to.
486 2018-03-12 22:57:20 @GMPBuryWest
Tall man dark hair in Small Orange van with black writing “JCB” turned up at our house in Walshaw tonight around 5.30pm. Wanted the keys for the dumper truck because it had “an oil leak”.  All bogus he was trying to nick the truck. GMP know of such a distinctive van?
487 2018-03-12 22:57:13 How’s the food tase without the oil flavor?
488 2018-03-12 22:57:11 I started to send her some coconut oil. 
489 2018-03-12 22:57:08 My only interest is maybe some oil to infuse into something to make something to help me sleep.
490 2018-03-12 22:56:59 im very bored so i thought id make a clay mask to do some spot treatment on my pimples using tea tree oil and a cotton swab.

495 2018-03-12 22:55:58 Just asked Dacia if she knew what oil to put in her car and her reply was petrol
496 2018-03-12 22:55:48 that's not me, that's UKofGB&NI's submission to UN, prepped by the Permanent Committee on Geographical Names & the Ordnance Survey of GB. 
only 'usually called a country' by ppl who don't know/don't care/have an imperial outlook they seek to impose/rly don't want to lose the oil.
497 2018-03-12 22:55:35 Take a teaspoon of the oil since it comes in solid form and it melts in the mouth as it gets swished around. It’s often called pulling and is umm less than pleasant
498 2018-03-12 22:55:34 Honey x oil x brown sugar it actually works tbh for me
499 2018-03-12 22:55:05 What is Congress waiting for, to subpoena Future Venture LLC to find out more about this illegal oil deal in Venezuela between Don Jr, Gentry Beach and top National Security Council officials?
500 2018-03-12 22:55:05 Sir Ian wood getting a free PR job on scotnight. Philanthropist? Is that the snappy name for feeding mince to Scots in order to screw them out of more oil money for the Britnat establishment?. How many teaspoons of oil have we got left this week? Enough to keep UK from tanking?
501 2018-03-12 22:54:50 You people that don’t have 4c hair are lucky af, I don’t understand how my hair sucks in so much oil after two days... WHY ARE YOU DRY ALREADY?! WHY ARE YOU DRY?!
502 2018-03-12 22:54:40 interesting that you do not look into the funding of a cause that you support, I can make it easy for you tho, it is all from oil companies, most $ is from foreign-owned oil companies trying to get support for a pipeline that most of the profits will go to Texas, not Canada
503 2018-03-12 22:54:34 Pretty sure my car just almost blew up. Had to turn it off while in the drive thru. Now realizing that I’m 3,000 miles past needing an oil change. Whoops. 
504 2018-03-12 22:54:32 That's what you get from a snake oil salesman. All talk no action.
505 2018-03-12 22:54:27 Okay, update! Done: oil was delivered...yay! Took trash to the transfer station, got guinea supplies, stopped at grocery store, came home and put everything away, switched laundry and started another load, checked in soup, drinking water #4, and cleared off table.
506 2018-03-12 22:54:16 Does it work elsewhere? E.g rubbing clove oil onto an aching muscle?
507 2018-03-12 22:54:16 Norm, Oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly Oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off Buildings. Pls tell @vancouverpride how u rationalize obstructing  Gay friendly Oil while enriching Gay killing oil @VictoriaPride

515 2018-03-12 22:52:57 yeah i gotta get one then! but for now i guess i will use sunflower oil since i dont hav  much at home lmao
thank you once again!!
516 2018-03-12 22:52:53 Oil imports are larger from Canada than from Saudi Arabia yet Saudi is the villain to people like that guy you just had on@SteeleAndUngar

519 2018-03-12 22:52:09 If you have a strong smelling essential oil like cinnamon, you can dab it around and the ants will hate it.

522 2018-03-12 22:51:31 My mum used to say that about castor oil.
523 2018-03-12 22:51:21 of course its all some big secret conspiracy crap isnt it Yet Israelis can buy oil on the market with no problem & have massive gas reserves Just like its the evil Saudis/Yanks supporting ISIS yet u can't give an explanation why your Russian heroes have arms deals with the Saudis
524 2018-03-12 22:51:20 Squeaky clean. A well oiled and oil funded kinda clean.

527 2018-03-12 22:50:55 Does the same thing. With the oil easier to apply. But with the cloves- ucanjust bute into it and keep it in the effected tooth. Numbs the pain considerably for a little while. Then when the pain relief does just chuck another one in the mouth.

529 2018-03-12 22:50:27 I have never understood how people used coconut oil directly on their face! But severely oily skin do wouldn’t even try it.
530 2018-03-12 22:50:16 I hear you on that, but if you walk into any South Jersey cheesesteak joint and ask for lettuce, mayo, oil, etc. on your cheesesteak they'll know you're from waay out of town. I've been to Hoagie Haven many times. Overrated

536 2018-03-12 22:48:50 yeah sorry saw the other part of the thread
MXM should help, I only take fish oil for stuff like this
nail building takes quite a long time though and from what I understand the minerals don't deposit directly it's like a build over time kind of thing
537 2018-03-12 22:48:50 My grandparents used to make us take fish oil 
538 2018-03-12 22:48:41 I attempted to make pork lo mein and between the splattering oil and the fear that I was going to set off the building’s fire alarm, it was extremely stressful. Pretty tasty though.
539 2018-03-12 22:48:09 Also coincidence that Saddam started accepting euros for oil 6 month before the war.
540 2018-03-12 22:48:04 Technically you reimburse the oil companies.  Fuel taxes are collected at the refinery based on amount of on-highway fuels produced.  The jobber reimburses the refinery for what they purchase, the retailer reimburses the jobber, and you reimburse the retailer.

545 2018-03-12 22:47:56 So... You walk everywhere do you? Better not use shoes that have rubber soles, or any other of the 1000's of petroleum by products.. In fact, the computer/tablet/phone your using to post on social media is a by-product of oil.. but yes, continue to take the moral high ground
546 2018-03-12 22:47:29 I tried the coconut oil but then I started breaking out :( I can’t even have decent sleep because uni is taking over my life
547 2018-03-12 22:47:28 I guess it’s all the OIL money that’s making us play so slick 
548 2018-03-12 22:47:15 Wow. Beautifully rendered visuals of oil slick light, lush green flora and savage fauna, that at times is simply breathtaking. Its a slow burn brain bender that may prove to be Marmite for some. Cronenbergian body horror, brief,shattering violence and a wonderful score 
549 2018-03-12 22:47:12 Then maybe just maybe we could stop importing all the oil we use in Canada. It would also put to use the destroyed by the fossil fuel industry areas of Alberta.
550 2018-03-12 22:47:05 PM has got Ont & Que backs on Steel & Aluminum Industry (7 Billion /year) & is putting NAFTA @ risk to protect Ont & Que Dairy Farms but won’t get involved & hasn’t got the back of Alberta’s oil/gas industry (7 Billion /year) He can’t hide when Alberta cuts off oil/gas to Vanc

555 2018-03-12 22:46:39 Trust me, you want to buy a grillpan that goes on the fire, season your salmon (with skin) with 4 seasonspepper mix, smear a little bit of olive oil on all sides, make the pan hot, grill the skin crispy, and then the other sides. Best salmon you will ever eat with practice.
556 2018-03-12 22:46:20 Change would be great (I just installed a set of Renogy solar panels), but attacking petroleum producers is a silly way to go about it. As long as demand exists, a supply will exist. Thinking you can reduce oil production & emissions by attacking oil companies is foolishness.

574 2018-03-12 22:43:07 actually looks like there's palm oil on the face
575 2018-03-12 22:43:05 unless oil can harry says NGAAAAH you can count me out
576 2018-03-12 22:42:38 I love cooking with turmeric,it does hold magic powers along with that coconut oil. :)
577 2018-03-12 22:42:35 Economics is to be self sufficient in oil, stop importing 100's of tanker loads on east coast and employ Canadians. Just plain dumb not to.
578 2018-03-12 22:42:27 pake baby oil/zaitun/vaseline bisaa. iya bisa krn mascara atau kurang minum air
579 2018-03-12 22:42:22 With the EPA done, tRumps oil and coal partners can wreak havoc on the environment. Think of all the $ they could save by dumping in the rivers and using Fracking to mine
580 2018-03-12 22:41:57 WTF you think England is going to do ---buy oil somewhere else?
581 2018-03-12 22:41:14 34 dollars for eight pieces of chicken...

That's ONE CHICKEN. You can buy a roaster at the store for eight bucks! You're CHARGING TWENTY SIX FUCKING DOLLARS FOR FLOUR, EGGS, and FRY OIL. NO. This should be a crime.
582 2018-03-12 22:41:14 someone who advises ppl to use coconut oil on their face should go to jail
583 2018-03-12 22:41:13 Is clove oil more effective?
584 2018-03-12 22:41:07 I'll try it! I wonder if the liquid coconut oil would work as well so I could do a spray bottle
585 2018-03-12 22:41:05 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
586 2018-03-12 22:40:47 For any of you western separatists stop blaming other provinces for your issues - with all the money Alberta had when oil was over 100 did you diversify the economy  no - nada that must be Quebec’s fault also

591 2018-03-12 22:40:05 めっちゃ眠い、あと4枚…
592 2018-03-12 22:39:45 Damnnn you can’t use the perfectly ph balanced, antimicrobial and antibacterial benefits of oil pulling and moisturization.. I’m sorry...
593 2018-03-12 22:39:37 I mean, that sounds like it would be convenient, but also executive overhead? I considered to myself today that I should probably save my EDS hands by putting a different dispenser on my jojoba oil bottle but then I have to locate and buy one and remember to put it on.   Hmmmm.
594 2018-03-12 22:39:36 There isn’t enough evidence to suggest that eugenol (chemical compound extracted from clove oil) is effective for tooth pain. Research shows many natural remedies may not help. In fact, the majority of herbal medicines have not been scientifically tested.
595 2018-03-12 22:39:33 I love seeing that entitled little oil spill squirm
596 2018-03-12 22:39:17 lettuce, tomato, mayo, oil and vinegar should never ever go on a cheesesteak
597 2018-03-12 22:39:14 we made vegan brownies and all the oil (a not insignificant amount) separated out during baking and ended up pooling on top. Being cheap college students we valiantly tried to eat them. They were...rubbery. (the next recipe we used was good tho)

600 2018-03-12 22:38:48 Pomegranate body scrub. Lavender oil. Almond oil conditioner. Coconut oil with rose on my face and feet. I smell like the living incarnation of The Body Shop.
601 2018-03-12 22:38:34 if I pick you up will someone go with me to get my oil changed cause I don't wanna go alone 
602 2018-03-12 22:38:33 Engine oil is even on ground sef
603 2018-03-12 22:38:32 Absolutely. People are just a natural resource to be exploited or discarded. We're whale oil to the left, but they'd never form any political movements to preserve the likes of us, that's for sure.
604 2018-03-12 22:38:29 Note to self during oil scenes: BUY DAWN DISH SOAP
605 2018-03-12 22:38:16 Yepp. New respect for anyone in the oil field. My ass dead after today
606 2018-03-12 22:38:15 #opticians said my tears are drying up - not that I'm cold & emotionless! I spend a lot of time at the PC. Your tears have 3 layers, 1 of which is oil. My oil layer is like fat in a cold frying pan, so my optician said...
607 2018-03-12 22:38:02 If you want to go all Biblical on them, bio war has a solution. There are a couple fungal strains sold in an oil suspension (Beauveria). Mostly a greenhouse solution but I’ve been told BotaniGard is effective in fields. Might be expensive for a small # of plants.
608 2018-03-12 22:38:02 maybe we should rub our fat cocks together some time. maybe a little oil.

two fat cocks.

oil.

together.
609 2018-03-12 22:37:51 Yeah! To hell with climate change costing billions every year, and to hell with the environment. After all, tripling filthy oil production and shipping it over precious lands and waters is the way to go. Right Rachel? To hell with our planet.
610 2018-03-12 22:37:50 My dad sent me to get oil & a filter for my car, why was this shit harder than math and science
611 2018-03-12 22:37:28 im applying this oil on my face twice a day to grow a beard cus my puberty never kicked in
612 2018-03-12 22:37:27 Peterson deserves to be taken seriously in that he is an effective snake oil salesman with a PhD who is trying to indoctrinate underachieving young white cis men with right-wing reactionism thinly draped with "logic," "rational debate," and "psychology."
613 2018-03-12 22:37:23 Just got home from the gym. Next up. 1. Shower  2.  oil 3. Get fucked  4. Shower 5.

615 2018-03-12 22:37:08 Venezuela's business is not, and hasn't been for years, oil. Venezuela lives on drug dealing, money laundering and terrorism.

619 2018-03-12 22:36:30 I say keep ICE and revoke and strip the citizenship of the leftist loons then deport them to an oil ring in the Atlantic where they can form their own country!  Of course, we can use it as a bombing target for our Air Force 
620 2018-03-12 22:36:29 Shared ecological heritage? What the heck is that measured up against an oil spill? If this is about putting more oil tankers on the water and increasing the risk for BC then the answer is a resounding NO! You're not selling us on hell! #bcpoli #canpoli #StopKM

639 2018-03-12 22:33:09 Uh so if you wanted to properly use an oil for skincare, you would hydrate first and them moisturize with an oil that fits your skin needs (some oils can nourish skin).
640 2018-03-12 22:33:09 We are lucky to have excellent alumni in Timor including Ministers, Ambassadors, Gvernment officials, oil and gas experts, NGO workers, and people at the UN.
641 2018-03-12 22:32:57 So apparently coconut oil fades scars  i didn’t know that
642 2018-03-12 22:32:56 Talking to my dad about the cancer we will get from living by the oil refineries. He said, “We have good genes.”
643 2018-03-12 22:32:50 Yea..it is..but. it. is. oil.  LOL
644 2018-03-12 22:32:31 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.
645 2018-03-12 22:32:17 To say that Venezuela's heartbreakingly inhumane situation is mostly caused by decrease of oil prices is both simplistic and irresponsible. It's been corruption, drug dealing business and ineptitude what has brought us to this point.
646 2018-03-12 22:32:14 They are employed by HMG on UK soil so surely all paid the same or like oil rig workers /seafarers pay tax where domiciled, get rebate, not on secondment to a different country?
647 2018-03-12 22:32:13 At age 12 I decided I was going to bake my OWN birthday cake. This was also the time when my mom was reusing Crisco Oil for frying french fries. I used old, used french fry grease in my cake.
648 2018-03-12 22:32:10 I just submitted a comment in response to the Culver City Draft EIR that would allow the city to extend their portion of the Inglewood Oil Field by 30 new oil wells. Tell Culver City Officials: No New Oil Wells In Culver City! Submit your comment here: ht
649 2018-03-12 22:32:10 One of the first things we need to do in order to end oil, is stop looking for more. The NZ Govt has the power to stop oil exploration here.
650 2018-03-12 22:32:08 Hot oil treatment 
651 2018-03-12 22:31:52 Food rations consisted of 1kg of flour, 1 l of oil/month, meat was scarce, people (apart from the dictator and his family) had 4 hours of hot water/day, absolutely no one could have a job in the middle class without being a member of the communist party.
652 2018-03-12 22:31:44 Hoagie Haven, in Princeton. Try it with lettuce, tomato, onion; mayo; oil & vinegar; salt & pepper; oregano.

654 2018-03-12 22:31:29 I mean, why in the Hell would Putin want Trump, he already has enough on Hillary to blackmail her into submission. Trump ran on increasing our military might, lowering regulations to help rev up our economy and increasing oil output to lessen our need for foreign production.
655 2018-03-12 22:31:13 Yeah i gotta get this job so its straight oil and lemonade for me
656 2018-03-12 22:31:01 OIL DIFF: 3.68 -> 3.68
657 2018-03-12 22:30:56 This sounds revolting (it is) but if you get a coughing fit in the dead of night and nothing works, a spoonful of olive oil or equivalent will do the business. This is from personal experience.

667 2018-03-12 22:28:52 Once the oil companies hear about it and want to start drilling Uranus we're done for.
668 2018-03-12 22:28:34 Exactly! Change the oil religiously, drive like you got sense and they'll treat you well. I replaced the Dodge only because I wanted 4X4 and power windows 
669 2018-03-12 22:28:27 I hope all goes well for you tomorrow Gail!! Have you tried Copaiba Essential Oil, I started using it for my spinal stenosis pain and it has helped tremendously!!! 
670 2018-03-12 22:28:20 Believe it or not, the more you wash your hair the more oil your hair produces! :) Same thing used to happen to me too! I started skipping one day at a time and eventually I got to a week
671 2018-03-12 22:28:18 Who cares hes such a has been wanna be blah blah
672 2018-03-12 22:28:07 Did you dilute the tea tree oil or did you put it in your hair like that ?
673 2018-03-12 22:28:06 Dems and independents live in cities. They control shipping, oil, commerce! GOP are rural. They control agriculture. The cities are now growing organicly on rooftops because big companies are taking over small farms =GMO & pesticides. Dems and independents can and will fight
674 2018-03-12 22:28:05 Arnold: I can show you how to lift weights and act badly but I’m not a brain surgeon. I’ll sue oil companies that provide gas for my hummer.
675 2018-03-12 22:27:59 twice because oil builds up more when you was every day :) (qualified hairdresser)
676 2018-03-12 22:27:57 Brilliant - AFTER we installed on oil with no rebate. And learned to our dismay that heat pumps keep furnaces inactive so baseboard pipes burst. Higher power bill & still oil?  Consider  a large red warning label on heat pumps - NOT FOR USE WHEN TEMPERATURES FALL BELOW -5.
677 2018-03-12 22:27:52 This body lotion smells amazing but it has mineral oil which makes me sad 
678 2018-03-12 22:27:36 @Hellmanns, love your new advert. Sustainable tomatoes are clearly erhmm something, Seeing as your mayo is 78% rapeseed oil I'm a bit surprised you never bothered to mention it though?

684 2018-03-12 22:26:59 Lucky! I’d love to only wash mine once a week! I usually go about 2 days and by the end of the second day it’s like someone poured coconut oil on my scalp 
685 2018-03-12 22:26:52 I wash mine every week or week and a half. Depends on how oily it feels since my hair doesn't produce oil as fast as others.

692 2018-03-12 22:25:34 The pasta, which you can drain a papercup of oil from, is a personal favourite of mine 
693 2018-03-12 22:25:29 I wanna pour my old oil on their rental cars
694 2018-03-12 22:25:20 I was climbing the walls for a few days last month when mine decided to take a growth spurt. I can HIGHLY recommend Clove Oil. It comes in a little bottle, dip a q-tip in & rub it all over the sore tooth & gum. It’s a natural anaesthetic. Numbs everything  (tastes rank) 
695 2018-03-12 22:25:13 Need to get away, back to Pecos I go, Oil Field Life
696 2018-03-12 22:25:13 This "infighting" narrative is mostly off.  Exxon Mobil supports a token carbon tax in principle, not an effective one in practice.  Even "reliably blue" states are afraid of oil's power and money.  When we overcome that, the rest will follow.

709 2018-03-12 22:22:43 Aphogee protein treatments, aphogee shampoo and conditioner, Wild grow oil, and stop putting heat on it
710 2018-03-12 22:22:42 The day I decide to go get my oil changed on my own is the day I’ll officially be an adult 
711 2018-03-12 22:22:42 similarly, we poured used fry oil from NYE tempura into a ginger ale bottle and a couple of my sisters drank some of it
712 2018-03-12 22:22:41 When I was a kid I woke up thirsty in the middle of the night & took a giant swig of what I thought was apple juice & what in fact turned out to be used cooking oil which my miserly parents decided to store for future use in an apple juice container.
713 2018-03-12 22:22:04 Smh y’all used to stay dragging me for dragging coconut oil & now y’all are all coming around 
714 2018-03-12 22:21:52 Sent 17 y/o to @jiffylube for $40 oil change ($25 w/coupon.) It became $90+ because of unscrupulous practices: up sell, misrepresent, and take advantage. Be warned. Afterward when I called, I got lectured by them. #unscrupulous! Buy & shop your local mechanic instead!
715 2018-03-12 22:21:51 You are correct- we would have had electric cars in the early 90’s if big oil hadn’t killed it
716 2018-03-12 22:21:51 European investors were similarly sanguine. However a sell-off in oil, lead and aluminium suggests sentiment soured. @MicMcCarthy_CMC
717 2018-03-12 22:21:31 And man u ain't selling De Gea either,not to real Madrid,not after ridiculing us at d transfer window

722 2018-03-12 22:20:23 You tell someone you do politics and are forevermore asked about trump and the EU when your entire course thus far has just been about 20th century oil wars
723 2018-03-12 22:20:08 This old fussy should get arrested by promoting foreign oil and taking foreign money
724 2018-03-12 22:20:00 I got oil paint on my pants, so everyone is invited to it's funeral x
725 2018-03-12 22:19:49 I don’t mind people making judgements about MoE without experiencing it. All I ask is they read around the subject before making a judgement and don’t call it a fad or snake oil...
726 2018-03-12 22:19:48 I knew something was up when T. Boone Pickens switched from oil to water...
727 2018-03-12 22:19:36 The fact I didn't think when I changed my bed covers to my silk ones as they mint &I so comfy And then I just put my tanning oil on and now I'm slipping out of my sheets! why do I do this to myself 
728 2018-03-12 22:19:36 I’m an Indian immigrant to America and I could care less. Honestly I’d put this in the same category as the $200 jeans that are already ripped with oil stains. I roll my eyes and move on with my life.
729 2018-03-12 22:19:17 That’s fuckin awesome. @JustinTrudeau I wish you more like this!!!!!  Make Canada Great Again. Use our own Oil and get the rest to Tide Water. Boom. Canada great again
730 2018-03-12 22:19:01 Great chart and interesting points. Another way to look at this is through #ERoEI and the so called 'energy clif'. Even the 'conventional' oil/gas fields will differ depending whether they are from the 'original' fields(1930s), the 1970s discoveries or now, i.e. declining ERoEI.
731 2018-03-12 22:18:39 If olive oil is made outta olives, WHAT IN THE WORLD IS BABY OIL MADE OUT OF?
732 2018-03-12 22:18:32 She told me I was getting an oil treatment and I damn near cried. I cannot wait.
733 2018-03-12 22:18:15 If you get a chance, ask Kapler about the many uses of coconut oil.
734 2018-03-12 22:18:10 do you like massage with oil in the body call me ok
735 2018-03-12 22:18:05 wish twitter moments could talk about important shit like the oklahoma walkouts and the oil industry corrupting our state legislature instead of stupid shit like “is bruno mars appropriating culture?” smh
736 2018-03-12 22:17:49 So with my severe lack of oil rn a spooning bud would be greatly appreciated tonight #chilly #ImAnIdiotWhoForgetsToOrderOil #CantAdult
737 2018-03-12 22:17:47 There's something in Alberta that forces dudes on the oil patch to wave their dicks around arguing about who's is bigger. Should call 20/20 or Marketplace to get to the bottom of this
738 2018-03-12 22:17:27 #MATD is going to be one of those stories that you tell you grand kids about. The last frontier of onshore oil  exploration. Opportunities like this are once in a lifetime for aim companies and when you get it don’t let go build and hold tight. #LSE #NYSE #FTSE #OIL #NASDAQ
739 2018-03-12 22:17:20 My company is pulling out of UK and taking our oil production technology with us after this .
They forfeited the right to be treated as a " free country " . Bye bye British oil production.

741 2018-03-12 22:17:15 I need to remind him to cop me some avocado oil and ice cream in Yonkers.
742 2018-03-12 22:17:13 It was though.
Except for the blood.

Oh, and the oil.
743 2018-03-12 22:17:11 Response to @GreenpeaceNZ. You cannot “end oil” by ceasing production in NZ. That’s because it’s a demand-driven industry, so no production here only means it will be produced overseas and imported. A very bad economic deal for NZ! Also, NZ environmental regime much better most!
744 2018-03-12 22:17:09 Your oil blends can smell like any combination of essential oils you like. Those can be a little pricey upfront, depending on the specific ingredient, but they last a long time.

Keep all of these oils in a dark place away from sunlight and heat.
745 2018-03-12 22:17:06 The Invincibles and Manchester City should never be compared. Not only cause one lost and one didn't. But also because we were only third richest in the league, whereas they have the wealth of an oil nation and are far far richer than everyone else in the league
746 2018-03-12 22:17:05 @CNNSitRoom Nunes proves he's willing to carry water for Putin. The GOP stands for Gas,Oil, Putin. This is a Political Party of Treason.
747 2018-03-12 22:16:50 Grey suits? You mean MEPs?

758 2018-03-12 22:15:37 I took some castor oil I’m tired of being pregnant 
759 2018-03-12 22:15:36 By using oil, isn't he a co-conspirator in the crime?
760 2018-03-12 22:15:27 My boo has thick, coarse beard hair. The thick carrier oils I use for him are: olive, avocado, and castor oils. Apricot kernel oil is also good for thick hair.

For thin strands I would recommend: almond, coconut, and sunflower oils.

769 2018-03-12 22:14:18 Not only are trains more risky for oil movement, takes away capacity to move other commodities, specifically grain.

771 2018-03-12 22:13:59 Cal Nichols deserves more recognition, without him and the investors group we are Oil Kings

773 2018-03-12 22:13:43 Please fight to have resource revenue excluded (like quebec)from equalization renegotiations next year. Do not budge.

774 2018-03-12 22:13:37 @JuddApatow @paulrust Hate to break it to you, but there aren't any mountains in southeastern South Dakota, nor is there any oil.

775 2018-03-12 22:13:30 Now we will all have to quit eating meat because the meat will not be healthy.  Trump intends to dirty up everything, example fill the ocean with oil well leaks & kill off salmon.  There has never been such hate toward a nobel prize winner (Obama).

787 2018-03-12 22:12:29 Oooo bummer! It now has the fine point focus- great for macro or sharp focus on bird eyes. Some lagginess with ProCap combined with C-AF TR. Overall no real issues but might dig into forums. Did you mean oil??

793 2018-03-12 22:12:02 Wind power is around 40% (maybe even a bit higher, I’m not sure) & the rest a mix of gas, coal, oil & biomass, I believe (I’m no expert on the topic, I must add, tho ) We have quite high ambitions when it comes to renewable energy. I think the goal is to reach 100% in 2050!
794 2018-03-12 22:11:50 That's kind of what the EU is doing no? and it seems more like a trade war waiting to happen that I'm not sure we can win...I'd like to see him at the very least support local export industries (oil,asbestos etc)

796 2018-03-12 22:11:35 Only wash my face with water, no soaps. I have sensitive skin so the less I do to it the better it’ll be. I also wash my face with witch hazel at least 2-3 times a day, moisturize with tea tree oil, aloe Vera or cocoa butter
797 2018-03-12 22:11:09 People are enjoying oil a lot these days but ten years ago it was rarely heard of. Never heard of this one. On my Google list!
798 2018-03-12 22:10:50 And a quick google search shows connections to suncor and amcor. Oil and pipes. Again, disappointed.

853 2018-03-12 22:04:19 If you say the oil companies will pay for clean-up and remediation, I've got an ocean-side lot in Saskatchewan to sell you for a great price.
854 2018-03-12 22:04:16 I know I say soil, boil, and oil weirdly. You ain't gotta make fun of me for it, that's just the way I talk

861 2018-03-12 22:03:05 Daily meal: Morning: Water with lemon. That's it. 2pm: Huge fruit salad. Wait 30 minutes. Then: 1) Big salad. With avocadoes, greens, nuts, seeds. 2) Huge plate steamed veggies. 3) Big serving of beans or potatoes. Add olive oil & herbs. It's MORE than enough. Try it. You'll see.
862 2018-03-12 22:02:56 Lions and 2nd RD picks are oil / water.  I hope they trade out of the 2nd this year.  
863 2018-03-12 22:02:52 I like the doors that have a lifting layer of old oil paint that you slip a knife under and they peel off with no work at all.

868 2018-03-12 22:02:09 Ruby ran quickly and grabbed a oil can and began to help Penny.
869 2018-03-12 22:02:09 "Alberta’s huge deposits cost too much to dig up, refine, and ship. They are in the wrong place. And they rank among the dirtiest to refine into gasoline, aviation fuel, or home heating oil."
870 2018-03-12 22:01:52 Also they have Oil and Slavery money. They can get anyone for that position.
871 2018-03-12 22:01:32 Can't the schmaltz Blimp, dry up & float away. A Macys blimp balloon. Imagine 'birthing' that! What's his lineage? Wesson oil?!

874 2018-03-12 22:01:21 If history is correct it has to be market driven. Let's have the market (which cons revere so much) tell THEM that e-vehicles & renewable tech is the way forward. And not have an industry subsidised like oil/motor vehicles have grafted since Ford's time.
875 2018-03-12 22:01:15 his parents were nurses so he obviously grew up quite middle class in a very safe environment. he never would have wanted for much. his parents would have pensions and benefits so it's not like he has that burden like some of us. 
he's a snake oil salesman

891 2018-03-12 21:59:54 Well his money is from oil and gas as a result of privatisation when the USSR crashed. He is on the supposed list of Putin allies so would above some form of sanctions potentially. What is United's link can't be bothered to read the article

893 2018-03-12 21:59:50 We who support the pipeline and our oil & gas industry actually surpass the environmentalist lemmings by our knowledge of the industry, environment, economy, and more importantly our conviction.  We fall short only by not having funding to pay for and pull together large throngs

"Oil does help, and I was beginning to run out, too!"
895 2018-03-12 21:59:46 And yes, acrylics. I love the 3D effect. Doesn't oil take 6 weeks to dry?
896 2018-03-12 21:59:39 I've had a pork shoulder, bbq, onions, and some oil in the slow cooker all day while I've been at work. The house smells amazing. Can I eat the air? I've been trying... with mixed results.

902 2018-03-12 21:59:15 Lol the cast iron experts are really going ham in the comment section of this episode of laid-back camp. You can also get a preseasoned skillet. But I suggest also putting a little oil with it.
I'm not sure which, but probably something neutral.
903 2018-03-12 21:59:10 SMDH.  Take a look in the mirror.  How does it feel to shill for oil companies that pollute the planet and imperil our children's futures?

913 2018-03-12 21:58:11 You would think though they would be more interested in how Scottish Oil defeats the rules of physics , shrinking and expanding during interaction with politics and indeed Mr Wood's involvment - which might explain why he is a SIR of course.

916 2018-03-12 21:57:57 @laurby Sometimes, I wish Alberta would cut off oil transportation and the protestors would have no petrol for their motor cars, and no way of using their motor cars without fuel.  No motor car transportation.

920 2018-03-12 21:57:37 We've had enough.Given the political oppression & lack of security for US citizens caused by the UK government my company will soon cancel the licensing of our oil production technology to all UK public & private energy organizations.  Our personnel will leave the UK as well.

922 2018-03-12 21:57:23 Natural Beauty Tip for Fair skin:-

926 2018-03-12 21:57:12 He combines so many things I dislike... Bigots, snake oil salesmen, self-aggrandizing self-help pushers, ignorant white dudes who get to pretend to be smart just because they are a white dude in a suit, etc
927 2018-03-12 21:57:11 Decking cleaned waiting for better weather to apply the oil.

931 2018-03-12 21:56:37 this would be crazy if you think about it
932 2018-03-12 21:56:34 Does that mean that CO2 (CCS or mined) is so cheap, you can use it to drive out small amts of oil? Or is driving out the oil important to making that space good for CO2 underground storage? Questions abound...
933 2018-03-12 21:56:28 I am the proud owner, I mean wife, of a bearded man. What base oils do u recommend? He abhors anything overly scented but I'd like to give this a try. I love oil for my hair as well but I'm tired of paying outrageous prices.
934 2018-03-12 21:56:27 While Transmountain has not reported a spill in four years, there have been plenty of crude spills. There are options to change direction in this country, people need to dig out of oil addiction, yes, and look forward. It can be done, and I will continue to call for the change.

940 2018-03-12 21:55:58 Trump is no president he's a snake oil salesman.

950 2018-03-12 21:53:51 @Honda_UK all I wanted was a price for a rear differential oil change and having being told the service team will contact me  I’ve had no reply 
951 2018-03-12 21:53:46 truuuuuuuueeee. hmmm. what about black? that might look cool. maybe with the right eyeshadow over top it'd look like an oil spill! though that trend was a while back. i love the gold flakes though! i think you can keep that going for a long time!
952 2018-03-12 21:53:20 They'll pump until the last drop is gone-we won't be ready-they don't care as long as they get every last $ they can. Russia btw has huge oil reserves. Texas has made some advances in alt energy. My daughter can get free power in the evening as the bleed down solar/win energy.
953 2018-03-12 21:53:02 We need to get into solar  this oil shit is ridiculous

960 2018-03-12 21:52:25 I can't help you if you can't comprehend what "every single one" means.
But I guess I shouldn't be surprised considering the entire anti-pipeline campaign is funded by foreign oil companies. Your weak mind proved to be vulnerable to their propaganda.

962 2018-03-12 21:52:07 Peanut allergies cause 130 or so deaths in the US alone every year. My daughter has to carry an epipen with her all the time in case she inadvertently eats something with peanuts in, or that was cooked in peanut oil. So much for a "gift from god".
963 2018-03-12 21:52:03 Unless Corbyn going to tie massive international loan repayments to oil when it's at peak value then I doubt the UK has much to worry about
964 2018-03-12 21:51:58 tbh we already are but oil blah blah blah
965 2018-03-12 21:51:52 Again. Something faster. 

Don't they make like beard oil or something? Would that work?
966 2018-03-12 21:51:51 I am not an NRA member, but its ridiculous how much the media blames them for everything.  The NRA is a laughably small lobbying group with very limited financial resources.  Yet the media treats them like the boogey man with wealth and power greater than big oil and pharma...
967 2018-03-12 21:51:44 How about considering someone with an honest opinion, this man was part of project fear in 2014 claiming the oil was running out, now he has taken over oil fields etc.,his unionist opinions are not welcome in Scotland.
968 2018-03-12 21:51:41 I love getting fresh things done to my car lol, oil changes, vacuums, new fresheners 
969 2018-03-12 21:51:38 If you have a person you care for a lot in your life that has a beard, make them beard oil. It's very easy, and quite economical.

Commercial beard oils can go for as much as $40 or more. I can make a beard oil with better and/or higher quantity quality ingredients for cheap.
970 2018-03-12 21:51:31 It's a small volume of material, it wouldn't take a lot to bring it into the country. You could try this yourself with a 20 ml vial of sugar or silicone oil and see if the border authorities spot it. I reckon not. It's not a magical material, just a liquid or solid in a container
971 2018-03-12 21:51:27 You actually do more damage to Dundee with your ranting. You obviously know bugger all about the Oil and Gas industry and how it works. There are many skilled people from Dundee who work all over Europe and the world you belter.

973 2018-03-12 21:51:06 big data changed us a lot, no? filmmakers gambled before, now they already know how many viewers they will get even before a film is released or even made.

big data is now the new oil!
974 2018-03-12 21:51:05 the oil change guy was like i have bad news and good news which one do u wanna hear first , i said the bad news and he was like " i'm not single "  OKUUURR
975 2018-03-12 21:50:56 Come now Dom.

The Saudis and Russians are pals now Dom...havent you seen the love they share for trying to manipulate the oil price????

978 2018-03-12 21:50:28 I want some huge 70's oil tanker type, or a Desoto with huge fins.
979 2018-03-12 21:50:27 Is a huge bonus control if my blood sugar  together with following LCHF .. I consume butter, avocado, F/R/eggs coconut oil daily
980 2018-03-12 21:50:23 Or how he's ruining the oil industry...or how he's planning to shut down the entire asbestos industry down over unchecked facts. Trudeau has his priorities wayyyyy upside down. should go back teaching about things instead of trying to create or implement them

982 2018-03-12 21:50:11 Natural Beauty Tip for Fair skin:- 

A mixture of olive oil and sea salt is needed. The ratio of the mixture must be two to one. 

Applying this body scrub and massage for a few minutes. Rinse with cool water.
983 2018-03-12 21:50:05 I hope the oil companies counter sue and clean him out.........
984 2018-03-12 21:49:41 Bumper to bumper warranty & free oil changes for LIFE?... biiihhhh.. 
985 2018-03-12 21:49:34 They did yes and that was despicable. We missed out on the oil work partly down to corrupt local Dundonian councillors and businessmen. Some who have hob knobbed & Lorded it about the city for years.
986 2018-03-12 21:49:11 Damage part is hard to say. Everyone’s hair is different. I’ve been soaking mine in coconut oil afterwards. It’s helping but there’s definitely damage from previous lifting.
987 2018-03-12 21:48:54 The question anti- @TransMtn pipeline refuse to answer has nothing to do with oil tankers and oil spills and destroying BC’s coast and everything in it. #bcpoli #canpoli #StopKM
988 2018-03-12 21:48:52 When you’re singing the pipeline song @BlairKing_ca don’t leave the chorus out about the oil tankers and the oil spills, or the question about safe transport to Westridge, but NOTHING about where the oil goes next will come up again and again and again. #bcpoli #canpoli

991 2018-03-12 21:48:38 @Honda All I want is a price to change the oil in my 1st generation CRV but it appears after being told I’d be contacted I’ve been forgotten about
992 2018-03-12 21:48:38 ur ye tho?   I'll ask again, what is Scotland's share of north sea oil according to GERS which you have to be citing for you fiscal transfer pish here, Wizbit?
993 2018-03-12 21:48:37 Correction: Crude oil
994 2018-03-12 21:48:33 Coconut oil
995 2018-03-12 21:48:30 I've spent all evening having claims about alkaline water & coconut oil for teeth preached to me. No amount of evidential links has deterred this person. They simply believe that all disease can be cured by various fads. It's exhausting!
996 2018-03-12 21:48:10 I am no doctor.. I know Dr.s have  with symptoms and refer for lab blood work. Are we asking  wrong questions correlating to lab results? Remedy's and medication data correlation instead of big pharma or snake oil INS. Costs of unknown cures?
997 2018-03-12 21:48:01 了解！
998 2018-03-12 21:47:37 I so would love to pour oil all over your hot body
999 2018-03-12 21:47:35 tea tree oil
1000 2018-03-12 21:47:29 Hot oil treatment done  my hair benefits greatly from this
1001 2018-03-12 21:47:00 That is the problem in general...there is no money in a carnivore diet.  Big pharma loses, big medicine doesn't benefit, wheat growers and the gas and oil industry lose out.  The only people who benefit are ranchers and the carnivores.
1002 2018-03-12 21:46:56 for my AM moisturizer, i do a clay mask to rly suck up all that nasty oil and debris stuck inside my pores.
1003 2018-03-12 21:46:39 I grew up in a Delta state or Warri that people are begged to work, if you show willingness to work, you get paid a king's ransom to learn welding, rigging, scaffolding, sand blasting and fitting. Today you pay a god's ransom to ride keke or okada. Okowa is this the oil city?
1004 2018-03-12 21:46:38 Coconut oil for the beard.
1005 2018-03-12 21:46:35 ゆきこさん
1006 2018-03-12 21:46:31 "Extra Virgin" Olive oil?...
1007 2018-03-12 21:46:28 Pretty much what I heard from some I know that take this very seriously. You might have more states than Texas banding together (OK, AR, LA) in order to be self sufficient WRT economy, communications, oil, food, defense, etc. Regardless,It would be ugly & the hardships extreme.
1008 2018-03-12 21:46:25 I just brought sunflower oil let’s get this skin right omg
1009 2018-03-12 21:46:24 This question is wrong for too many reasons.
There was political turmoil in Afeghanisthan.
US exploits the political scenario trading drugs, oil and weapons. Tons of money, training, assassinations... an industry that already striked Colombia, Iran and Iraq

1010 2018-03-12 21:46:11 Mike, Energy East is required to move AB Gay friendly Oil to the east coast to displace Dictator oil. Besides, JT killed EE in favour of enriching dictators.
1011 2018-03-12 21:46:02 Schwarzenegger planning to sue oil companies for 'knowingly killing people all over the world’
...And for all the money he spent oiling up as a body builder.
1012 2018-03-12 21:45:58 これ
1013 2018-03-12 21:45:55 So no bad news from the mechanic? I walked out with just an oil change? Hmm seems fake but ok.
1014 2018-03-12 21:45:54 It’s a Peugeot. Since the Mi16 and the 309 Goodwood the most interesting thing it could change would be its own oil.
1015 2018-03-12 21:45:53 Me no, but it sounds like Josh may be in need of some olive oil to rub on his "pulled groin" so stop at the grocery store too yo 
1016 2018-03-12 21:45:41 Only problem I have had with mine is oil stem seals are leaky a bit when cold.
1017 2018-03-12 21:45:21 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.
1018 2018-03-12 21:45:20 We’re not just talking mines here although your figures can be countered by that Wilson shut down small redundant mines & there were jobs in oil as compensation, but Thatcher had an agenda against the miners with no planning in place. But she also shut down manufacturing
1019 2018-03-12 21:45:05 Crypto is the new oil.#cryptocurrencies
1020 2018-03-12 21:45:01 Olive oil nko
1021 2018-03-12 21:44:51 I know classic stoke can't really expect much against the oil money scrubs can you really, much better than 7-2 
1022 2018-03-12 21:44:48 And, I ask, now that America has plenty of oil and gas and is becoming a net oil exporter why are we taking a chance of ruining our offshore sea beds? Worse, inland we've just reserved a large portion of one of our beautiful national parks to oil and gas exploration. ENVIRONMENT!
1023 2018-03-12 21:44:43 Pssh....Britain doesn't even have oil.
1024 2018-03-12 21:44:13 Ohm Ogler Occurs Oil
1025 2018-03-12 21:44:11 Big has always been my favorite shampoo with its refreshing sea salt, Dark angels does wonders for my face with the charcoal powder and avocado oil, I love the exfoliation and cocoa butter from Buffy and Charity Pot is an obvious staple!

1027 2018-03-12 21:43:56 @UKHouseofLords 

I'm begging you to have someone run down to that door in the chamber behind Lord Hope and apply some oil on the hinges.

Every time someone goes through it the squeaking makes my dog jump off the sofa and I am forced to grind my teeth.
1028 2018-03-12 21:43:47 please do not bully oil can harry

1035 2018-03-12 21:42:58 Looking like an early night,
lights out, heating off. Conserving my oil since he said it’s all but gone in #indyref.
1036 2018-03-12 21:42:45 21 followers. Block and move on. Not even worth mentioning that whisky alone accounts for a large portion of UK food & drink trade or that oil has to be stripped out of Scotland’s export figures lest it dwarf the rest & skew the figures.
1037 2018-03-12 21:42:45 Your opinion. And frankly I don't care if the oil industry wants special treatment to be more efficient. They can use the infrastructure we have in place like every other industry. 

The existing KM is just fine for batch shipment and the new expansion is for heavy oil only.
1038 2018-03-12 21:42:36 I should have never smoked a Packwood..now i feel like all my blunts need to be pre-rolled w oil inside dipped in kief w a glass tip in a fancy container
1039 2018-03-12 21:42:32 C'mon, Terry. This is not a pipeline that has a bad track record by any means. Yeah, there have been spills. But the reporting requirements are so stringent that even the smallest amounts of oil spilled must be reported.
1040 2018-03-12 21:42:20 Reading comments from NYers, Cuomo okay with nasty fracking outside the City, but opposes ghastly oil drilling offshore that might bother wealthy residents and tourists. Am I rite?
1041 2018-03-12 21:41:55 Dear @realDonaldTrump , scientists say the nerve agent that poisoned 3 people in the UK is Russian. Now you have a tough choice between backing a) the ally that sacrificed soldiers in the US war for oil in Iraq or b) a murderous tyrant who shot a passenger plane out of the sky
1042 2018-03-12 21:41:53 The used cooking oil processing center on Baptist World Center Dr is especially rank after it rains
1043 2018-03-12 21:41:51 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
1044 2018-03-12 21:41:51 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1045 2018-03-12 21:41:48 New business idea: nail salon next to a car wash/ oil change place. You’re welcome!
1046 2018-03-12 21:41:44 You go in to get an oil change and leave with a $760 estimate on recommended repairs. 
1047 2018-03-12 21:41:43 Speaking of....It’s been 7 whole days since I’ve had oil.....and I’m sad. Lmao
1048 2018-03-12 21:41:39 Teach me your recipe whenever you have time! I think I'm going to start with something cheaper like oat or rice because I'm using almonds to make almond oil for beauty products and that's a lot of almonds+water+money
1049 2018-03-12 21:41:36 it’s gonna form a bump. put tea tree oil on it everyday to stop it.
1050 2018-03-12 21:41:19 I also tried shaving soap, but found it a bit too harsh for my skin - it brought me up in a rash. I ended up going back to gel. Although shaving oil wasn’t too bad either.
1051 2018-03-12 21:40:48 Well done! Loving the JET ! 
Need more oil and petrol sponsorship in motorsports!
1052 2018-03-12 21:40:47 My truck is finally at 100k miles :( currently getting an oil change

1058 2018-03-12 21:40:23 The problem lies with manufacturers & retailers, developing countries don't have good refuse services & only 7% of Worlds plastic is recycled. Most single use goes to landfill & can be carried into waterways. Bio plastics exist but priced out by Oil companies cheap plastic!
1059 2018-03-12 21:40:16 Endless oil story
1060 2018-03-12 21:40:04 All of oil
1061 2018-03-12 21:39:59 And I've never looked back. I cooked  with Cold Press Virgin Coconut Oil , eat full organic butter, an avocado , 2 free r/eggs everyday..
1062 2018-03-12 21:39:53 Very sad and that will lead to a rise in illegal immigration to EUROPE and the USA.These countries need to take care of their people and use their oil reserves to compensate for their failing economy.
1063 2018-03-12 21:39:46 Every time you get an oil change WITHOUT changing the filter, an angel loses its wings. I'm just sayin'.
1064 2018-03-12 21:39:43 We should aim to seize the oil supplies in the Caucasus. Then march on Stalingrad.

1071 2018-03-12 21:39:20 May God dry our crude oil so our eyes can be open to the potentials of Agriculture in Nigeria... Let Agriculture be controlled by the local Government of each state. We will tend to see more result also by setting a target for each state.
1072 2018-03-12 21:39:14 I just dropped 325 to get my car’s oil leak fixed. I guess “something else is messed up and making the oil leak now” so here goes another 150. I call bullshit. Ugh.
1073 2018-03-12 21:39:05 I need @GM to tell my chevy dealership to give me a lifetime of free oil changes! I’m always having issues with this damn car
1074 2018-03-12 21:38:47 Here at ford getting my focus oil changed and tires rotated.
1075 2018-03-12 21:38:45 Alb/Sask should secede and work directly with US to get pipeline to the coasts for oil and LNG. Great engineers here but they can work in US

1083 2018-03-12 21:37:23 The goal isn't to be correct or incorrect, the goal is to bewilder and distract. He dogwhistles numerous different things and commits to none of them. He is a snake and sells his own oil.
1084 2018-03-12 21:37:23 @MassAGO theatens legal challenge over offshore oil and gas drilling plans, citing impacts on fishing, environment. “Of all the bad environmental ideas the Trump Administration has proposed, this one may take the cake,” she says. #MAPoli

1088 2018-03-12 21:36:42 City have played the best football by far this season. Truth is, they are only where they are due to the oil man's cheque book. Pass that book to Stoke and they'd be the same in a couple of seasons #bbcfootball
1089 2018-03-12 21:36:36 I'm trying lol, these oil wells taking too long to frac. Hopefully I don't get sent out on another one so I can have a few days off
1090 2018-03-12 21:36:27 Aid convoys are getting in, the Russians have been leaning on the Syrians to make it happen, has she not seen the BBC reports? Unfortunately, the 'rebels' are still shooting, forcing a response because they're trying to bring NATO in. Then there's all that lovely Golan oil...
1091 2018-03-12 21:36:19 @VeggieGrill what happened to you guys today???  No oil so I couldn’t get what I wanted and then I open up my salads and there is no dressing for either of them - I guess it’s a bad day over there!!!

Don't:

- Get into full boost before the engine is warm
- Shut it down after running it hard

Do:
- Let it warm up a little (30 sec) before driving it, especially cold. 
- Keep an eye on the oil level. 
- Use synthetic oil
- Have fun

1107 2018-03-12 21:34:09 Being rhetorically "committed to meeting our 2030 climate target" =/= having a plan to meet the target.

Your government wants to let oil sands emissions grow 3X from 2005 to 2030.

Why should the rest of Cdn economy need to work harder so oil industry can pollute more?

1124 2018-03-12 21:32:38 Venezuela slides deeper into poverty having based their economy on oil. A sobering lesson for those touting fossil fuels.

1143 2018-03-12 21:30:20 I asked where the funding for the pro-pipeline comes from and how much $ has been put into this campaign ie: pro-pipeline gathering march 10th, oil sands action , paid lobbyists, etc you have investigated financing of the no side but not the pro side
1144 2018-03-12 21:30:20 Carbon dioxide is a direct byproduct from burning oil/gas and it is fact that rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is increasing global temperatures. Maybe now you are a little more educated.

1148 2018-03-12 21:29:47 @Schwarzenegger you should print a shirt that says PUMP IRON, NOT OIL and use the earnings to fight big oil in the court!
1149 2018-03-12 21:29:40 Brace. Menu. Glue. Oil. Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then everything changed when the Glue Nation attacked
1150 2018-03-12 21:29:39 You only see what they want you to see on TV....... and nobody is grabbing oil except Iran & Russia on a massive scale. Obama gave them the oil in Iraq & Syria #Facts
1151 2018-03-12 21:29:29 Oil money
1152 2018-03-12 21:29:27 watched, He is only talking about digital space. Our IT companies, Hdfc bank, Icici bank, ..almost all the pvt sector banks are controlled by gora shareholders..In times of a crisis will they work for India or China or Pak? In 1971 the American oil cos. worked for Pak!!
1153 2018-03-12 21:29:16 I used to have an Audi A2 1.2 TDI! And was stupid enough to practically give it away. It drove on canola seed oil! (Yes!)
1154 2018-03-12 21:29:12 the sooner oil and gas runs out the better place the world will be
1155 2018-03-12 21:29:00 Self-care is dabbing large amounts of peppermint oil upon your forehead, but then it doesn't stay on your forehead and it instead drips down and goes into your eye, so for a good ten minutes your eye is in searing but refreshingly cool pain

@pjc_cunningham @Adrianwfire you gents ready for tanker spotting?
1160 2018-03-12 21:28:16 The management made us use different trays and tongs to prepare the burgers and a separate fryer to cook them but completely ignored the oil transfer issue
1161 2018-03-12 21:28:08 ma forse no, forse tutti i delitti vari de tomas milan,oil bar sport, ma chi cazzo se ricorda,ma che cazzo de domanda eh :)
1162 2018-03-12 21:27:38 W're always somehow in the losing end of these deals (even before Trump) now the US is trying to make it worse. our leadership needs to stand strong and protect its local businesses and export industry (talking about oil asbestos steel and much more)
1163 2018-03-12 21:27:33 Well there is oil in Golan Heights , which is recognized as Syrian territory .
1164 2018-03-12 21:27:29 it’s been telling me oil level low for at least 2 weeks nowI’m gonna check it today
1165 2018-03-12 21:27:24 Thanks to you, @GOP, @realDonaldTrump, we are already in the dark ages.

Must be all the noxious smoke from coal and oil.
1166 2018-03-12 21:27:24 We’re here getting an oil change & there’s a couple ppl and Ariel seriously just farted sooooo louddd
1167 2018-03-12 21:27:24 AWWWW...Poor Precious Raspy Cinnamon Roll trapped under an offshore oil platform...

...OFFSHORE OIL PLATFORM!? Okay, who built it?! And WHY!? What could the Digital World possibly need an Oil Platform for?! WHAT DO THEY HAVE THAT RUNS ON OIL?! #YearOfDigimon
1168 2018-03-12 21:27:21 I haven't washed my face in like 3-4 days cause I ran out of coconut oil (the brand I used not sold in stores) now my face feel like plastic and I'm breaking out in awkward places 
1169 2018-03-12 21:27:08 Nonsense ! We witness the reality of modern warfare every day on our TV's ! Its brutal and nasty and should be a last resort not a tool for grabbing middle east oil and recourses in other parts of world.
1170 2018-03-12 21:26:58 Where is the bottom of those oil rigs?
1171 2018-03-12 21:26:49 "Super grateful for this location. Started off with calling BigOTires asking if they had room for an oil change..." @Groupon #HappyCustomer
1172 2018-03-12 21:26:38 if you use an oil and a serum, which should go on first?
1173 2018-03-12 21:26:36 "great and fast service!  angel was really helpful and polite.  will comeback again for oil change and..." @Groupon #HappyCustomer
1174 2018-03-12 21:26:22 Do not rub your eyes with peppermint oil on your fingers... #essentialoils #itburns
1175 2018-03-12 21:26:12 No her and trump have similar policies anyway, they’re both centrist elites. They both care about GOD - Guns, Drugs, Oil and Big Banks + Big Pharma ... it’s all the same shit.
1176 2018-03-12 21:26:06 picture this...you’re laying outside... outside of your dorm... covered in coconut oil... and someone walks up behind you... and asks if you’re sun tanning... ¿???¿¿?¿???¿

1178 2018-03-12 21:25:59 But on a serious note I forreal thought my car was just gonna die on me the way it’s been acting lately,  but I just got an oil change and it’s crazy how much of a difference it made. ALWAYS take care of your cars guys!!
1179 2018-03-12 21:25:57 Rosehip oil and jojoba (as too raw to use straight)
1180 2018-03-12 21:25:54 Value of Aus LNG exports is around $22 B. Expenditure to dates is hundreds of billions. Qatar export oil, pipieline gas, gas liquids and LNG for $26B with much smaller expense. Our offshore gas was stranded until LNG
1181 2018-03-12 21:25:47 If my memory serves (and it might not) the interest in Kosovo was largely around building a pipeline to get oil out of the landlocked sands and on to ships at sea to be exported more expediently.
1182 2018-03-12 21:25:34 I hate auto service shops- NTB got the last set of XC90 tires to make it easy to oil change & rotate tires in one stop... 23k miles and they say tires show alignment wear (they did alignment when installed) and that alignments should be every 6 mos.  sayonara NTB!
1183 2018-03-12 21:25:33 Stunning!  This oil or acrylic?
1184 2018-03-12 21:25:13 I’ve had such a productive day.  Got to work on time & caught up with my Bible reading on the train.  Went to the gym after work, food shopping.  Made my lunch for tomorrow.  Currently face masking, oil my scalp then shower, read my Bible all on track to get 8 hours sleep

1188 2018-03-12 21:25:03 Went on a run w/ the homies out in the Big Creek/Angeles Forest canyon and now my brakes are burnt, oil gone and one of my rear tires are ready to bust how much wire it’s showing

1193 2018-03-12 21:23:40 @Schwarzenegger great job going after the oil companies, maybe now you can go after the vaccine companies for "knowing killing people all over the world" too. Aka SIDS, encephalitis that looks like Shaken Baby Syndrome, etc.
1194 2018-03-12 21:23:23 Creme of nature with Argan oil or straight from Eden ain’t your regular , it don’t even come affordable to start with
1195 2018-03-12 21:23:12 I actually found an attractive white boy and I’m shocked with myself  I should’ve got at that because I could’ve gotten free oil changes lmfao

1197 2018-03-12 21:22:29 Use wildgrow oil. It helps tremendously. I used i when I got my brows done by somebody sketchy and it helps bring them back. 
1198 2018-03-12 21:22:16 Of course Cramer told us Oil was going to $42 ....
1199 2018-03-12 21:22:04 I’ve got lots of stuff to prepare for this week so I won’t be online tonight either but I promise to be on tomorrow!! I’m thinking oil/cum show goal
1200 2018-03-12 21:22:02 ... to paint with oil paints for the first time ... is like trying to make something exquisitely accurate and microscopically clear out of mud pies with boxing gloves on.

1204 2018-03-12 21:21:10 Senator, it seems her only goal is to defund public education and prop up corporate charter schools so they can teach kids how wonderful the oil industry is. We’ve been seeing this here in OK for the last 5 years.  Defunding Public schools via GOP.
1205 2018-03-12 21:21:07 Spinach/seaweed in sesame oil?
1206 2018-03-12 21:20:59 So, why are shale companies plunging and underperforming the oil price by up to 90%. The performance of shale companies does not suggest they are profitable.

1210 2018-03-12 21:20:39 James is a fake name I sometimes use and I might have conned a minor demon named Googlsnarf out of his oil or it could be a completely unrelated message
1211 2018-03-12 21:20:37 About 70% of olive oil being sold is not actually pure olive oil.
1212 2018-03-12 21:20:24 Getting an oil change top 10 chores I despise
1213 2018-03-12 21:20:02 let me tell y’all i was pulling the fries out of the fryer at work and the fucking oil fell on my finger and i swear i was about to cry lmao that shit hurt

1215 2018-03-12 21:20:00 Everyone also knows how many direct flights after choosing to click thru or anyone except the other online research by oil
1216 2018-03-12 21:19:59 The @NRA actually represents millions of Law Enforcement Officer as well as Military Men and Women.  The Banking, Pharma, Oil, Tech, and Defense lobby each spend more on politicians every year than the NRA could ever raise. The NRA gets its money directly from its members.
1217 2018-03-12 21:19:59 Got my oil changed at Walmart and they vacuumed out my car 
1218 2018-03-12 21:19:51 @JoshStein_ thanks for defending NC's beautiful coast! As a former Texan, the south TX beaches would become littered with clumps of oil and dirt from off-shore drilling... would be a tragedy for that to happen to our beaches here
1219 2018-03-12 21:19:47 Read my tweet again
1220 2018-03-12 21:19:46 My mom bought a coconut scented oil for the diffuser and now the whole house smells like a bottle of Malibu rum
1221 2018-03-12 21:19:44 Day 1 of using coconut oil on my hair and I already feel a major difference, I’m livingggg!!!
1222 2018-03-12 21:19:43 I have two questions.
1- where else is unconventional oil being produced apart from US? Do we know how many barrels?
2- does the peak mentioned relates to peak oil theory?
1223 2018-03-12 21:19:36 If it’s on the chin, avoid sugary and junk food for a while. Gently double cleanse (on no make-up days, an oil-based cleanser followed by gentle foam cleanser; on minimum make-up days, micellar water, oil cleanser and foam cleanser), tone with a mild salicylic solution OR glyco-
1224 2018-03-12 21:19:29 Ok this is true, I'm referring to the damage that they do to the earth. My god just the damage oil company's have covered up is massive. I grew up and worked in the west Texas oil fields the hidden messes more than rival all the oil spilled in oceans just there.
1225 2018-03-12 21:19:14 more like oil wealth gushing for a small western liberal country!
1226 2018-03-12 21:19:11 Love ya' but...unless I am wrong historically 
-phobic means aversion, avoidance, away from. 
As in, "Oil is hydrophobic" - no fear involved.

Psychology screwed up in its zeal to appear scientific & borrowed from chemistry, again, without really understanding.
1227 2018-03-12 21:18:52 So I left home early. I was like yea I can get my car washed and do this oil change but I was like fuck I don’t have tools at home. I remembered I do actually but I did remember I don’t have my oil filter cap with me
1228 2018-03-12 21:18:45 Why not ? Ordinary people were allowed near his convoy in the other states he visited

1230 2018-03-12 21:18:44 Bio oil all over the face is a thinggggg 
1231 2018-03-12 21:18:30 Why do oil shills takes such extreme positions? I'm against burning oil and fossil fuels for their energy.

What will YOU do when the oil runs out?
1232 2018-03-12 21:18:28 Our company frequents Texas. So do many Canadians from Our Oil Patches in Fort McMurray, Alberta. Keystone Pipeline to be precise.

1234 2018-03-12 21:18:13 Why is synthetic oil so expensive 
1235 2018-03-12 21:17:49 Listen up granny we need manufacturing in the US that support our military without them get your head diaper ready got it. We need to make our own tires, steel, aluminum, coal, oil, because the rest of the world is taking advantage of our stupidity. How old are you granny?

1238 2018-03-12 21:17:21 Trump is not overruling fracking.  Why would he do that? All his oil buddies are frackers. Trump has reduced the various safety protocols: for example that methane should all be captured.

1247 2018-03-12 21:16:36 what can we actually do though? quite a bit of NATO imports Russian oil. Personally I think we should decrease the number of visa's for Russian officials entering the UK

1253 2018-03-12 21:15:45 Regardless of how you get the oil out of the ground, it's still ultimately become CO2 after it's burned. CO2 is the main problem. Yes methane is also a strong contributor, but the fuel if burned does not become methane.

1256 2018-03-12 21:15:20 Oil as a gradient of biology - transcendental principle, whereas Conrad starts with any species and letting it often produce
1257 2018-03-12 21:15:15 Speaking of.. reminds me I need an oil change! Dang flabbit!!! All this car stuff just reminded me of that. And for good reason. Phew. I just wrote that on my mental list. Twitter saved me from a possible catastrophe. 
1258 2018-03-12 21:15:13 Like, I’m eating Brussels sprouts cooked in coconut oil. #enoughsaid
1259 2018-03-12 21:15:08 They’re a teeny bit pricy so I try to hit the buy one get one 40% off specials ulta has. I use the coconut probiotic one at night (it’s oil free even though it doesn’t say on the front of the tube) and the cactus kale stress recovery one during the day! I love both so much.
1260 2018-03-12 21:14:56 so im waiting on getting an oil change & theres this other lady sitting about 3 seats away from me talking on the phone and her other trap phone starts ringing like wtf i can barely afford to pay my phone

1267 2018-03-12 21:14:28 I will gladly give back my 12 dollars a month from the Tax break, if It meant not being the laughing stock of the world, or assuring our National Parks and  monuments stay protected and  not up for sale to his oil buddies, or go back to having corporate polluted water and smog.
1268 2018-03-12 21:14:26 self serve olive oil stations seem like a good idea until u accidentally dump an entire bottle on yourself and spend the rest of the day smelling like garlic infused olive oil
1269 2018-03-12 21:14:24 I'm at honda getting my oil changed and they have FOX news on the tv... and I can't find the remote

1271 2018-03-12 21:14:17 i just put castor oil all over my body. from how fucking sticky it is im pretty sure that’s not what it is for but i’ll keep yall posted if something cool happens
1272 2018-03-12 21:14:16 That is important to note, for two reasons;
1. Long cycle of development, for conventional oil exploitation
2. Long cycle of production, for conventional oil exploitation
It is no coincidence that oil econ's declined along with conventional oil. 
What about demand, since 2016?

1277 2018-03-12 21:13:54 Are we trying to spend our way out of a oil/gas revenue problem by giving money to oil/gas industries?

1279 2018-03-12 21:13:44 Neem oil. Kills all bacteria, hydrates and soothes the skin. Treats rosacea. It’s amazing.
1280 2018-03-12 21:13:29 A Jungle Gym called Spaced Magnetism where you massage beards with coconut oil while photographing your hallucinations
1281 2018-03-12 21:13:24 I couldn't on mine....any oil oh dear, but on curly hair it looks very natural.....
1282 2018-03-12 21:13:08 What is common between me and olive oil ? 
Both are extra virgin
1283 2018-03-12 21:13:03 I prefer dark chocolate over milk chocolate. I also prefer unbleached, unenriched, non-gmo, organic, unprocessed, no palm oil, no high fruit corn syrup, no aspartame, no splenda,  no farmed fish FOOD!
1284 2018-03-12 21:12:50 Yoga and Lavender Oil will change your life in a way that's spiritual. Best believe.
1285 2018-03-12 21:12:37 WARM COD LIVER OIL COATED DOWN YOUR THROAT AND TONGUE
1286 2018-03-12 21:12:19 At the same time... stupidity should not be taken lightly. I should figure out the basic stuff like mechanical vocab, how to change a tire, how to change my own oil. Instead of how cut creases are done. Is that going to help u when ur on the side of the road sis?!!! 
1287 2018-03-12 21:12:19 Wasn't @Schwarzenegger the one pushed for legalization of Hummers on American roads? How is he in a position to judge the Oil Companies?
1288 2018-03-12 21:12:13 Great work. It would look great painted in oil. I’d buy it.
1289 2018-03-12 21:12:11 Congrats. If only the smell of hot oil wouldn't linger that long.
1290 2018-03-12 21:12:10 Sounds lovely.....mine fine and flat....someone I know uses coconut oil......it takes the frizzyness out.......
1291 2018-03-12 21:12:08 We use the calpol plug in/olbas oil every night. Snuffle babe if he’s unwell or Vicks Baby Rub (comfort one) if he’s fine. Helps him relax I think.

1298 2018-03-12 21:11:10 Pro tip: use olive oil when cooking your brusselsprouts, that way they will slide off the pan and into the trash far more easily.

1300 2018-03-12 21:10:55 W. borrowed the money off China. They in tern snapped up all kinds of 'stuff' here on the mainland. Buildings, banks, mines, oil wells. Now repubs are 'so sad' about that. With China moving more conservative lately, it's fitting reward for republican stubbornness. Still sad tho..
1301 2018-03-12 21:10:29 Investor concerns about rising U.S. #oil output sent crude prices  down on Monday, but investors stayed bullish on U.S. Treasuries despite  an increased supply of three- and 10-year notes.

1304 2018-03-12 21:10:16 Until the end of 2017, oil companies were taxed 9 cents per barrel to fund spill cleanups. Now, they pay nothing.  That means, whenever there's an oil spill, YOU are paying for the cleanup and the oil companies are skating away free.
1305 2018-03-12 21:10:15 US seems on the no of guys in the oil vadapavs.
1306 2018-03-12 21:10:11 RT @LivingSafely: Mountain Dew this March? The drink contains Brominated Vegetable Oil, a substance banned in Europe and Japan.

1309 2018-03-12 21:10:06 It can definitely make your skin worse if it’s not diluted, try mixing it with jojoba oil maybe? You have to be very careful with how much tea trea you put in though
1310 2018-03-12 21:09:49 Quick comparison: How deep are Arnold’s pockets vs. Oil Companys...
1311 2018-03-12 21:09:48 I know lol. THC is oil soluble so eating somethingoily or greasy helps your body digest it and break it down easier. Then you feel the high
1312 2018-03-12 21:09:43 one of  the Commonwealth of Nations I am sure would help the UK with OIL

1315 2018-03-12 21:08:55 Finally got my oil changed 
1316 2018-03-12 21:08:49 Battery is a consumable. Until battery technology changes, it’ll need periodic maintenance like oil changes if you want a phone for 3 years or more
1317 2018-03-12 21:08:44 Beautiful and scintillating just like Arab oil
1318 2018-03-12 21:08:42 Let’s get rid of pot first which is a carcinogen, a trigger to mental illness,a gateway drug and causes death and destruction on our highways and then work on oil problem.

1320 2018-03-12 21:08:37 Took a hot essential oil bath followed by a hot shower...feeling a little better. Still achey and tired. Still want some ice cream.
1321 2018-03-12 21:08:36 PKE is a good byproduct, it’s the Oil that drives this waste from manufacturing it. Stop using close to half of your supermarket products and make a Strong stand on it!!

1324 2018-03-12 21:08:02 No thanks, unlike u I don’t believe in the snake oil you’re buying
1325 2018-03-12 21:07:57 今回の騒動このまま放置されると全ての事柄に毎度毎度疑惑が出てくる事になってしまってとても面倒なので、ハッキリと何でこうなってしまったのか判明してほしい、誰が？とかよりも、何の為に？の方が大事
1326 2018-03-12 21:07:49 : There’s not enough soap, water, coconut oil, baby wipes, thoughts and prayers in the world to get this mic tape gunk and eyelash glue offa my body.
1327 2018-03-12 21:07:46 Lisa Murkowski is at war to take away Federally Protected Lands & sell them off to foreign corporations for oil, gas, and mining at expense of the environment, communities, and climate change. Precedent in Alaska can effect what happens to Federal Lands in your state. 
1328 2018-03-12 21:07:41 Coconut oil & tea tree oil , you can get from dischem or Clicks .
Aloe plant , just do a young walk in your neighbourhood.
1329 2018-03-12 21:07:39 My baby love baths followed by a coconut oil rub down and boobs.
1330 2018-03-12 21:07:32 Beans, corn, and wheat will all participate in this 20-40% first leg up in a bull market move.  

Oil you have to trade separately.
1331 2018-03-12 21:07:27 Liars gonna lie, and religion is a much more lucrative racket than selling snake oil.
1332 2018-03-12 21:07:24 .@GeorgeHeyman says gas in BC will never go to $2 to $3 a litre. That means he is calling @RachelNotley's bluff about cutting off oil and gas to BC. #bcpoli
1333 2018-03-12 21:07:22 I used to work in a McD and there is a lot of transfer between the oil vats during the filtering process so please don't assume any product is vege/vegan/halal even if stated on the menu. None if the strict Muslims I worked with would even touch the fries

1336 2018-03-12 21:07:06 Castor oil. used every 4-7 days it drastically reduces my acne
1337 2018-03-12 21:06:57 Well, I would much rather pitch in 7% of my income to make sure that roads are plowed, schools are funded, and every family in Alaska gets a full PFD.

People keep believing oil and gas will solve all our problems even though its a dying industry, like coal.
1338 2018-03-12 21:06:54 Fried ramen so fucking good but that oil will get ya.
1339 2018-03-12 21:06:54 #ukog due an update on KL1

1341 2018-03-12 21:06:36 You cannot build a wind generator without burning oil or gas. They need constant maintenance that cost more than they make. They are a susbsidized scam.
1342 2018-03-12 21:06:32 ARNOLD has been in cali. Too long.  He has become a libtard and is drinking from the punch bowl.  For sure.  Blaming TRump and oil for killing people.  Dont worry Arnold WHEN IT COMES TO UR MOVIES FOR NOW ON.  I wont be back!

1347 2018-03-12 21:05:33 Aldi has chickenless patties that I have with pasta a lot, you can make Vegan nacho cheese with potatoes/carrots/olive oil/nutritional yeast or Alfredo with cauliflower/oil/nutritional yeast. Rice & bean based dishes are usually cheap, easy, & filling

1351 2018-03-12 21:04:47 Do you know what Russians have in common with Igbos of Nigeria?  Both Christians.  Both read constantly and have high IQ's.  Other than that, they enjoy education and their families.  Putin should boycott Nigeria to raise oil/gas prices (good for Russia) and save Igbos lives.
1352 2018-03-12 21:04:35 I have a ton of Rem Oil, Hoppes, patches, rags, snakes, etc in one.
1353 2018-03-12 21:04:29 Finna see what this vitamin E oil life like  & I better see results 
1354 2018-03-12 21:04:26 Better chance to negatively affect the US by securing more access to mid east oil and therefore having more economic control, but I get your point. I'm not a fan of our foreign policy at all either.
1355 2018-03-12 21:04:21 i want to drink my tea tree oil
1356 2018-03-12 21:03:53 See I'm lucky that hot oil did not pour on me

1358 2018-03-12 21:03:37 Take your car in for an oil change.... find out your car needs quite a bit of maintenance  — feeling surprised
1359 2018-03-12 21:03:26 Synthetic oil is still oil, where is the line drawn? 
1360 2018-03-12 21:03:21 and.. how much money are you giving the rich oil industry to do this? #ableg
1361 2018-03-12 21:03:20 Be sure and ask him when the oil is going to run out now.
1362 2018-03-12 21:03:15 PAIN, Oil on panel, 2018.

1365 2018-03-12 21:03:05 Dry shampoo is a life saver, bro. Just spray some in and comb your hair out and excess oil dries up. Of course, it doesn't work for when your hair is legit dirty tho, just for making it less greasy-looking.
1366 2018-03-12 21:03:01 @sausagehobbit if my buddy can't wait it to the Oil Kings game tomorrow, do you wanna come with? It's at 7

1374 2018-03-12 21:02:23 Curious, what other countries publish openly such detailed crude oil import data?
1375 2018-03-12 21:02:20 And my mom will always love my dad. He took so much care of her when she was pregnant she was basically a queen. He would cook, clean and baby her so much!! Rub coconut oil on her stomach every night for all 3 pregnancies.. wow 
1376 2018-03-12 21:02:10 @Schwarzenegger I hope you do sue big oil!  I worked at refiner but was made to sign docs that offered I couldn't hold them responsible for carcinogens or cancer related illness.  Even with PPE, contaminated oil gets on your skin and you breathe it!  #makethemresponsible
1377 2018-03-12 21:02:07 Coconut oil or aloe Vera plant or tea tree oil

1379 2018-03-12 21:01:55 Maybe we should consider using PKK/YPG terrorism as a pretext to wage war on oil rich countries like the U.S. does with ISIS.
1380 2018-03-12 21:01:51 Tillerson, the oil man, in charge of foreign pocu, which is all about the oil. Carson, head of HUD who lied about living in the projects as a qualification.need more?

1382 2018-03-12 21:01:36 Yeah Man...They'll probably blame the House of Saud...but lets not throw Oil into the mix.....
1383 2018-03-12 21:01:35 Next time
Boil your rice till its averagely tender and sieve
Make the broth. Oil first or margarine (not too much)
Tomato sauce, seasoning Bla Bla bla
Stir in the rice
Add water in little quantity and allow to steam till rice becomes tender
Allow it to dry off
Viola!

1389 2018-03-12 21:01:03 @DoctorKarl In the butter spreads does oil and butter mi well or is it basically like margarine?
1390 2018-03-12 21:01:03 Does NEI ever talk to the oil majors about nuclear technology?
Recently it seems they are getting in renewables (again) but not nuclear AFAIK.

1394 2018-03-12 21:00:44 Not so liberal.  I don't think burning coal and oil are answers to producing energy.  Love the idea of wind power.  Works great if you can get over all those oversized fans out there.
1395 2018-03-12 21:00:43 Fam I'm actually so excited and there's so much joy in my soul when people are using an oil I created. Like what? Can't believe I actually put something out there. Still in shock
1396 2018-03-12 21:00:40 I come before You just as I am
I lay me at Your feet
I bring before You all that I have 
You are worthy, worthy,worthy Lord
Praise like oil. For You I pour it out

1398 2018-03-12 21:00:29 I'm changing my own oil next time
1399 2018-03-12 21:00:27 Også: "If we didn't do it (produce oil + gas), someone else would". Dette som en grunnlag for å vurdere om en handling er riktig eller galt er meget svakt. Kan man bruke den samme argumentasjonen for våpen eksport? Hva syns du om det?
1400 2018-03-12 21:00:18 March 12, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.

1407 2018-03-12 20:59:41 I'll buy you a bottle of valve oil if you make this stop auto-tweeting every day. You choose the brand!
1408 2018-03-12 20:59:16 They’ve awful — I suffer a lot. Someone massaging your temple and applying pressure to your forehead with oil or cream is good too x
1409 2018-03-12 20:58:32 I hope sir that you are going to lead the way and live the rest of your life without any products derived from oil.
1410 2018-03-12 20:58:32 How is it that I can change my own oil, check all my fluids etc, change a blown tire, was able to wire my new bed to my truck all by myself but my mom can’t put water in her radiator/resivor when her van runs hot???
1411 2018-03-12 20:58:30 I did notice a change right around the time of your divorce and Trump.. A very pro russia turn for the worse.. I wonder if you can comment or know if all those millions are from snake oil or funneled russian money? I remember when Alex hated Putin.

1416 2018-03-12 20:58:03 What's the cause of this prohibition?  Saudi oil. Governments are held ransom, the EU and UK will be islamised with the mass migration. Why are they not going to Saudi Arabia? It's an Islamic country with the wealth to take in millions, yet not one "refugee" wants to go there.

1422 2018-03-12 20:57:33 Just saw your vlog. Check your radiator if it's using that much oil. If there's oil in the coolant, its either a cracked head or blown head gasket. It will look like peanut butter. Get it to a shop asap before it starts overheating. It's still salvageable.

1424 2018-03-12 20:57:22 It lives on because the oil's still there. 9 trillion's worth.  Wake up, Brit, the climate is changing before our eyes, and it's been known since WW2 its cause.  Now you may not care about your children, but we care about ours. #PutinsPuppet #climate

1435 2018-03-12 20:55:49 Will Big Oil allow this to happen? I anticipate that we will see a lot of anti nuclear fusion rhetoric propagated throughout the population pretty soon.

1441 2018-03-12 20:55:18 Correct me if im wrong but it seems to be a number of issues. Identity of West Ham skewed sincr, broken promises etc. Issues which essentially are manifesting itself on the field due to lack of net investment. These issues are simmering in most non oil/gas rich clubs.

1448 2018-03-12 20:54:18 You need to keep up to date - The Russians and Chinese have their own SWIFT system. Russian sells oil and gas to China for Gold back Yuan, preferable to nothing backs the US dollar. Once the petrodollar fails, so does the US empire!
1449 2018-03-12 20:54:12 He's actually right. Trump has become humble after every time he shouts his mouth off he's humbled 2 the point of groveling after being reminded who owns him & how w-out them he'd be nothing.

1461 2018-03-12 20:53:01 Hmmm....that's N360 million. Invest in oil n gas and build some mega petrol station and like two domestic gas plants. Employ the best admins and watch my money pile up.
1462 2018-03-12 20:52:54 Have you tried pure CBD oil? It doesn’t get you high and it‘s been known to help with anxiety and depression.
1463 2018-03-12 20:52:52 Fried (hydrogenated veg oil) food (unless it’s in olive or palm oil and it won’t be in most restaurants) is so bad for us. If you’re in FLL, you need to take advantage of that amazing produce. In CHI it’s mostly tasteless / harvested before ripening. I love FLA farmers’ markets.
1464 2018-03-12 20:52:36 They're getting all the oil from# Iraq
1465 2018-03-12 20:52:32 a substance, preferably a natural oil/gel consistency that helps relax ass muscles. think warming muscle creams or throat numbing spray...but for your ass.
1466 2018-03-12 20:52:12 It’s a pattern in @realDonaldTrump choices for cabinet posts. Chose @EPA guy who used to sue EPA, chose HUD secretary who knows nothing about it, interior secretary who wants to drill for oil, etc... it’s a dismantling they’re aiming for. #CheetoMinions

Economics killed Energy East. They couldn't get any customers to sign on to the extremely high transport costs of $7-$18 per barrel. The plan was devised with oil prices over $100.  No longer makes financial sense.
1470 2018-03-12 20:51:46 was it Haley Toyota by any chance? Because even an oil change took 3 hours at that place.
1471 2018-03-12 20:51:36 You may be right =/ burger King annoys me too. But that's because for years they've cooked their veggie one in fish oil. Not sure if it's change yet.

1480 2018-03-12 20:50:17 My luck consists of going in for an oil change, and being told that I need to get my car fixed for $630
1481 2018-03-12 20:50:05 my coworker dropped a quart of oil and doesn’t exactly know how to clean it so the entire store smells like oil to the point where I started getting a headache and had to come to the bathroom to breathe clean air
1482 2018-03-12 20:49:57 And this is not even counting oil and other petrochemical spills and runoff on our streets and the general air pollution generated by older cars.
1483 2018-03-12 20:49:53 No worries, it was awful. Never seen so much crap come out of a van before. And it filled my car with stink, which I didn’t enjoy haha. Think the van needs some oil and TLC.

1486 2018-03-12 20:49:37 Pretty narrowed focus for me this week. Oil and indices basically. Watching several other assets/currencies for clues
1487 2018-03-12 20:49:32 Oil changes are bittersweet.
1488 2018-03-12 20:49:24 1 cup epsom salt 1/2 cup bentonite clay (optional) 1/2 apple cider vinegar 1/2 cup of avocado oil 10 drops of grapefruit & tea tree oil = the BEST bath you’ll ever have thank me later fr.

1491 2018-03-12 20:49:04 shea butter, vitamin e oil, vitamin c serum, & tea tree oil will never not be a part of my skincare regimen.

has never let me down to date.

*tea tree oil & vitamin c (l-ascorbic acid) are volatile so please proceed with caution & do research before adding to your routine.
1492 2018-03-12 20:48:51 Yeah... did that to me too. And the oil was already opened and by the amount in it, used. Still no response from Domino's although I tweeted on 11th. It's pointless calling the store for a small tub of rocket.
1493 2018-03-12 20:48:46 Dude nah I hate that oil shit lol
1494 2018-03-12 20:48:37 Good start to the week. Took some DWT off for now and added to SQQQ. Sold UGAZ for really nice gain. Like to see another pop in oil to short

1496 2018-03-12 20:48:35 End (or even discuss) the 100+ years of government support for perhaps the most mature industry on the planet (oil) and then you can come after ethanol. Until then, this is nothing more than another one of their campaigns.
1497 2018-03-12 20:48:18 I just started using the coconut oil one and for me it not only smells good but it holds my curls pretty well too

1499 2018-03-12 20:48:00 This is very good news, it puts the very idea of climate change on trial in a court of law, where oil companies get to defend themselves by proving it is anti-humanist fantasy. Very surprised the left went this route.
1500 2018-03-12 20:47:57 sadly no room ...why did they have to drill so many  but on a serious note, 2018 is shaping up to be a boomer for O&G companies ... I seriously hope we see many Oil strikes and we could be making a mint on AIM ..a Retail dream

1505 2018-03-12 20:47:28 True but not 100% of those "tankers" carry crude or heavy oil. Many of them carry canola/tallow/etc so not necessarily the same apple as those going into KM. Also missing are the ATB's that do carry heavy oil. 
1506 2018-03-12 20:47:18 I wash my hair till they make a ‘kikiki’ sound, which is the atmost satisfactory proof that, now there isn’t any oil left.

1532 2018-03-12 20:44:28 I’m hesitant to use oil of any kind. This hearth is in front of a wood stove that puts out unbelievable heat. So, I don’t want anything flammable/combustible. (Why I’m so eager to get the wax off)

Someone suggested white vinegar, haven’t tried that yet.

1545 2018-03-12 20:42:57 I've just heard that tomorrow's This Morning will discuss cannabis oil. 
While it is daytime TV, it is still on a mainstream channel.

1549 2018-03-12 20:42:17 Just feeezing to death waiting for my Jeep. Also... why does my oil change always cost a min of $100. Like wtf. Why?! 
1550 2018-03-12 20:42:11 All the soap in the world. Oil go still dey one corner
1551 2018-03-12 20:42:09 normal coconut seems better at targeting abdominal fat than coconut oil, its also far less vile to consume than coconut oil
1552 2018-03-12 20:42:07 This is what small manufacturers face. We have 50 employees that depend on their jobs and we can’t compete with aluminum Chinese Radiators, air coolers and oil coolers. Too cheap!! It was bad before, now worse!! Raw materials going up!! We need fair trade!!

1554 2018-03-12 20:41:54 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.

1556 2018-03-12 20:41:49 I just looked at your profile picture.   I immediately counted half a dozen articles made from oil.
1557 2018-03-12 20:41:33 i think i'm really going to try and change my own oil and spark plugs
1558 2018-03-12 20:41:33 But Kyle, what do you think of Ready Player One? (Can do the book, if you haven't seen the film yet.) I thought the book was OK, I was more interested in the world (re: peak oil, interesting tech like the customer service filter)... The romance, not so much.
1559 2018-03-12 20:41:27 يمكن ...
1560 2018-03-12 20:41:26 I had to reschedule my oil change.
1561 2018-03-12 20:41:21 Propaganda by UK. Syria winning the war, so Is real can't have their oil fields. Sound far fetched?
1562 2018-03-12 20:41:08 Yes, our brothers & sisters in Yemen need our help now, I don't understand how Saudi Arabia (one ot the richiest countries in the world) not help its neighbor, better weapons, great buildings & oil.

1565 2018-03-12 20:40:59 Yes the so called Department of the Interior is like throwing blood in the water to a shark these dotards don't give a damn about nothing but drilling for oil and selling off our precious wilderness areas to the highest bidder.
1566 2018-03-12 20:40:54 Why not America as the next great middle east? The great supplier of oil & gas to the world? 
- Obama just didn't want to be seen as "dirty" so for ideological reasons he chose to keep GDP growth lower than needed. If he'd have made an energy decision in 2012, we'd be better off
1567 2018-03-12 20:40:47 i get those too, i use a uhhhh lemon grass face wash and a moisturizer, i’m allergic to lavender but i heard it helps with hives. i also use eucalyptus oil on my face (diluted) but if you have pets i don’t recommend using eucalyptus too much. hope it helps bruh
1568 2018-03-12 20:40:46 If we want to fix the "Russia problem" we should quietly retaliate on the cyber front.  Then deny it.  Increase domestic oil product and drive down the price until we bankrupt them.  Not play Chicken Little as part of the drumbeat of nevertrumperism.

1571 2018-03-12 20:40:31 @Greens @RichardDiNatale Bans cover up of peak oil. All Australian cars (vital trucks for food transport to cities excluded) converted to EVs would require around 3,000 MW of ADDITIONAL power generation
1572 2018-03-12 20:40:30 That's why I want to relocate plus they've got crude oil
1573 2018-03-12 20:40:21 only real retaliation she can do is to get the Shale Gas & Oil flowing & stop buying theirs... hit them in the pocket.

1576 2018-03-12 20:40:09 Ah, so you want the oil to come from someone else's backyard.  Maybe change your state to be oil independent?  How many wind mills are you building?  How many solar panels on NYC rooftops?  Be the change you want to see in this world.

1591 2018-03-12 20:38:27 This week @Oceana released a new economic analysis that finds the Trump administration’s offshore drilling plan threatens more than 2.6 million jobs and nearly $180 billion in GDP…all for only two year’s-worth of oil and just over one year’s-worth of gas. No More Drilling!

1631 2018-03-12 20:32:12 Virtually every policy choice Trump has made since entering office has been at Putin's expense--killing Russians in Syria, selling arms to Ukraine, moving troops to the Baltics, encouraging oil and gas development and cutting LNG distro deals w/ Europe dependent on Russia supply.

1687 2018-03-12 20:25:59 'standing by' something should sound firm and imply integrity, however this sounds like people choosing to 'stand by' exploding oil drums on principle. managed for political ends and not societial ones.
1688 2018-03-12 20:25:44 Argon oil conditioner makes your hair smell so niiiceeee
1689 2018-03-12 20:25:33 Stream will be a little late need to get some food and an oil change. As soon as we get done with adult stuff we will be LIVE! #stuff #Life
1690 2018-03-12 20:25:32 Big oil would like to thank @Schwarzenegger for having one of the first Hummers. Nothing says clean air than getting 8-10 mpg.
1691 2018-03-12 20:25:31 WTF? A COMPLETELY unrelated issue attached to CBS oil bill? This makes absolutely zero sense.  But then again....Indiana.
1692 2018-03-12 20:25:29 most plastics are made out of oil... If we made a plastic house would that count?
1693 2018-03-12 20:25:24 I noticed that today too when I was going to retweet an @Schwarzenegger story of how he used his private jet to get to work as governor while now bashing oil production.
1694 2018-03-12 20:25:18 Why didn't they get involved with the Scottish Referendum? At the time WM declared that Scotland would not be allowed in EU (even with our oil) & the "UK" would have ended.  Would've been just as damaging to "UK" and EU & easier to do. Explain please?
1695 2018-03-12 20:25:10 No homework.. proper food edu meaning lunch is a class.. business planning & current events w newspapers.. basic law strategy.. schools should be buying cars & teaching kids how to change oil, belts starters & altornaters & flip the cars for a profit..
1696 2018-03-12 20:25:10 2018 goal: eyebrow game up

1700 2018-03-12 20:25:01 I had too much Vietnamese pride to say "no thanks" when she offered to put a generous spoonful of chili oil on my plain pasta and now my mouth is disintegrating
1701 2018-03-12 20:24:57 I really just want to sit and watch him play with his meat lathered in coconut oil while eating 10 lemon pepper chicken wings.
1702 2018-03-12 20:24:54 Regardless of what happens she will be back to her old job of fighting oil and gas in 2019

1705 2018-03-12 20:24:45 Vitamin E serum in oil on your face at night goes a long way
1706 2018-03-12 20:24:33 Olbas oil in hot water and steam away
1707 2018-03-12 20:24:22 No doubt it is biodegradable, not manufactured from oil and does not prop up financially any American backed regime.
1708 2018-03-12 20:23:29 When I got home from getting my oil changed, my mom was in the driveway crying. I flung open my door and asked what’s wrong. She said, “I thought you had already left.” 
1709 2018-03-12 20:22:48 How much for the beard oil?... Need to get some for the bae

1712 2018-03-12 20:21:50 At the ER for Liam’s tongue (he bit it in a tumble) and they’ve got TBN on in the waiting room. You’re getting your body AND your soul saved today.  they’ll be spritzing anointing oil on you as you get wheeled into the room. Lol!! I’m crying.
1713 2018-03-12 20:21:47 One shitty guy does not represent all men. Women need to stick up 4 the good men out there. I think it's a huge part of supporting equality. Men are not all bad, just as women r not all crazy. It's the squeaky wheel that gets the oil and we need to fight against that 2gether.
1714 2018-03-12 20:21:46 I need a good leave in conditioner cream but it HAS TO HAVE coconut oil in it. Any suggestions? Gotta be less than $12.
1715 2018-03-12 20:21:43 Off work and now getting my oil changed, adulting all day until being a kid again on stream later! #adulting
1716 2018-03-12 20:21:28 Ha! It's doused in extra virgin olive oil and salt if that helps?? Thanks buddy, chuffed :) x

1719 2018-03-12 20:21:13 The problem @BlairKing_ca , as I've pointed out to you countless times is that this isn't about just getting the fossil fuels we need to run our society to the West Coast...but rather the hidden plan to take that oil to sea in oil tankers and to put the coast at serious risk.

1725 2018-03-12 20:20:15 All I read was lube, and everyone knows coconut oil is the best way to grease the cannoli.
1726 2018-03-12 20:20:11 Just put tea tree oil on me face and genuinely thought me face was about to drop off
1727 2018-03-12 20:20:10 Oil prices are at a 3 year high. The missile attack on Syria was just for show (the airport was back up and running immediately after the attack). I'm sure putin didn't shed a tear for the 200 mercenaries who were killed. A plan was approved, no weapons have been sent to Ukraine.
1728 2018-03-12 20:19:45 Ok, no rose hip oil for my skin.

Why do I even try? Anything besides vitamin A cream makes me break out.
1729 2018-03-12 20:19:41 Sounds like you haven’t tried it yet. Get back to me when you have. Or buy the fancy ones that come packed in oil!
1730 2018-03-12 20:19:21 Yes.   If ur oil could be ur water pump
1731 2018-03-12 20:19:20 There are easy. Affordable ways to convert ANY vehicle into a hydrogen hybrid and nearly double fuel economy... it can be done. Just that auto manufacturers are in cahoots with oil companies.
1732 2018-03-12 20:19:16 This is ridiculous! bet you won't hear about that on national news...  What's with Trudeau's policy of overregulating every single industry. it's oil, now asbestos...when will it end??
1733 2018-03-12 20:19:13 And while they're at Mad Max we also need to start working on Houston favorite Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, the Head of the Derangement and Unhigement Department at Crazed U

Econ data best it's been in decades, so now we must turn this ship around and go the other way.
1737 2018-03-12 20:18:53 Is there concern with regards to the oil coming from the rear of the Ferrari PU? seems excessive
1738 2018-03-12 20:18:43 Brent oil ???
1739 2018-03-12 20:18:40 Oil city  why do hey exist ?  
1740 2018-03-12 20:18:17 OPEC is split over the appropriate price of oil w/Saudi Arabia aiming for $70 while Iran is content w/$60. OPEC could agree in June to begin easing current production limits starting in 2019 (Iran is eager to gradually raise its own production). WSJ

1744 2018-03-12 20:18:10 ask them the ratio of our dependancy on oil before and now, they wont get that. Free money era is gone for good.
1745 2018-03-12 20:18:09 peppermint oil is excellent for headaches!! pass it on!
1746 2018-03-12 20:17:47 I'm trying oil painting for the first time today. It's very cheap paint and it's hard to paint with. I want to trash it and try more expensive paint. This cheap paint will make you hate oil painting. I'll try to muster through it, tho.
1747 2018-03-12 20:17:37 Coconut oil saves lives 
1748 2018-03-12 20:17:33 I use raw African black liquid soap to cleanse, Thayer’s alcohol-free toner and a Neutrogena moisturizer. Then I use an oil serum to finish it all off and boom.
1749 2018-03-12 20:17:22 Thanks gill,  I'm going to try garlic infused oil and I've used the green bits of spring onions before.  The fodmap diet has been great for my husband and he doesn't have to be so rigid now 2 years on.  I hope it's good for your daughter too.

And can you grow it from a seed?
Would you stand, or would you kneel?
(Can you get weed for a good deal?)
Do u like your beaches clean from oil?
Or is it worth the risk to spoil it all?
Do you think the West is best?
If not, move East & join the rest
1752 2018-03-12 20:16:52 So @BrownEyed_Babee put me on to @lizzo on Friday and I haven't stopped playing Coconut Oil since.
1753 2018-03-12 20:16:38 Swozfool live without oil no oil in any form for one year first. That is it takes oil to work any farm so no farm food it no grocery store its no TV.  The electiy for you house use truck for work so no power and so on.
1754 2018-03-12 20:16:30 Catching up with some back episodes of #TOTP 1985 and Animotion could really do with a hot oil treatment.
1755 2018-03-12 20:16:17 Oil from your hair will get onto your pillowcase as you sleep, so change your pillowcases weekly to avoid sleeping on oil all night long.
1756 2018-03-12 20:16:13 Why? He's the one that said oil was done.
1757 2018-03-12 20:16:06 Funny how anyone pointing out how terrible electric vehicles are is labelled as an oil lobbyist.  Electric vehicles are subsidized garbage.!
1758 2018-03-12 20:16:04 It was a recession of HER making. It didn't need to happen in the first place. She could've used North Sea Oil to invest in our foundation industries & the country's infrastructure instead of squandering it.
1759 2018-03-12 20:16:03 In the 70s and 80s France virtually eliminated fossil from electricity and doubled production, this they used for heating. They would have gone further and started decarbonising transport but the oil price crashed.

At least think about this.

1760 2018-03-12 20:16:01 idea: build a house made of oil

1762 2018-03-12 20:15:52 Put it in a frying pan with some oil and flip em around until they get a lil golden n crispy on the outside
1763 2018-03-12 20:15:46 Travis is 80 yrs old. Only takes fish oil, Vit D, a prenatal vitamin and  1 tsp of coconut oil  two or three times a day.  i watched him walk out of dementia using these supplements only! Eggs are also great for eliminating dementia.

1765 2018-03-12 20:15:43 I guess it’s a perfect day for everyone to get their oil change 
1766 2018-03-12 20:15:31 My cat used to hide under the oil tank in the basement when we first rescued him and how he asks for pets and sleeps on our bed. Progress may be slow, but it's often beautiful. ♡♡
1767 2018-03-12 20:15:21 Guy I had that same ish some time back... My solution was a Bottle of Palm oil. 

Thank me later
1768 2018-03-12 20:15:12 It's always been liars pretending to speak for God, faking fits as if they're being moved by the holy spirit, spouting gibberish as if speaking in tongues, charlatans have been pulling this con for centuries Brenda, you're just the latest in a long line of snake oil salesmen.
1769 2018-03-12 20:15:01 For aftercare, try using a massage oil
1770 2018-03-12 20:14:57 We only have 2.5 bottles of olive oil in the pantry, so, good thing I bought another one today. 
1771 2018-03-12 20:14:53 The USA was never your ally, I'm sorry, but the Kurds have been used for the USA's agenda and now you have been discarded because they have what they want (established military bases and the oil wealth). You cannot rely on them to save you. Seek aid from the Syrian Government.
1772 2018-03-12 20:14:40 Pro-oil, free enterprisers have never actually explained to me why refining and using our own oil (while transitioning to renewables) to make us less dependent on foreign oil is such a bad plan. Because "markets" is all they really offer.

1776 2018-03-12 20:14:30 So many bitter Oil merchants in your mentions
1777 2018-03-12 20:14:19 I mean, what luxury commodities DON'T we politicize in the West/global north? And even some essentials. Water, oil, sugar, coffee, tea, gold, diamonds... I could go on...

1779 2018-03-12 20:14:10 @Schwarzenegger So you want to sue the oil companies? When they pay the giant fines and gas is $10.00 per gallon who wins fool! Typical Hollywood fraud,don't forget to fuel up your jet. #MAGA #RINO

1785 2018-03-12 20:13:41 Indigenous rights and health, climate change, intergenerational accountability, oil spills, the fact that there's a pipeline already all doesn't matter?
1786 2018-03-12 20:13:14 Yeah? She is a grifting liar/snake-oil-salesperson/con artist like her father. I am assuming that the two of you were not taken in by her BS. She is as dangerous as he is, and a part of his crime family.
1787 2018-03-12 20:13:13 i can only use their sensitive skin formula and never tea tree oil
1788 2018-03-12 20:13:04 Always wear gloves when handling any chemicals as cleaners are designed to remove oil and grease as well as the natural oils in your skin.

1792 2018-03-12 20:12:37 I have an oil change tomorrow and the dealership called to see if I wanted a vehicle upgrade instead. Is that a thing people do?
1793 2018-03-12 20:12:35 I saw him at the little oil lamps, shaded red, which the white sunlight where to join me.
1794 2018-03-12 20:12:35 Completely agree with that analysis. It's all about the energy which lies beneath. It was in Iraq and they try to sell us these lame dictator stories from CIA manufactured coups. Same CIA who are on advisory boards of oil companies involved and also Atlantic Council.

1800 2018-03-12 20:12:07 Time to get my oil changed 
1801 2018-03-12 20:12:00 democrats were literally standing with them, and the project was strong armed in by a Republican administration.

Seriously- where have you been? 

You think dems were in favor of any oil pipelines, let alone one through native water sources?
1802 2018-03-12 20:12:00 We need to explain too people that they were told lies. Brexit snake oil.
1803 2018-03-12 20:11:49 You should definitely have a spotter when you do that. Someone to catch you if you fall and someone to oil you up as well so you don't pull anything. As someone who cares about fitness safety I will glady take time out of my day to do that job...in the name of safety of course!

1809 2018-03-12 20:11:20 The moment eating animals will go out of trend will be when synthetic flesh is cheaper than real meat. It happend with whale oil and it will happen with this. The only thing we can influence is when exactly that will happen.

1824 2018-03-12 20:09:55 @Schwarzenegger The oil companies will bleed you dry, and send you back to Kilafornia penniless. Great move, don’t forget to file your i.d.10T with the Kilafornia Deparment of Justice.

1831 2018-03-12 20:09:23 Coconut oil and water is all I need in Miami 
1832 2018-03-12 20:09:13 All the pain relievers and Gatorade in the world wont help the glassy eyed passenger-in-your-own-body feeling after a solid bender. The IV is an absolute oil change. It just flushes out the bad. 30 minutes and you feel like you could pitch game 7.
1833 2018-03-12 20:09:13 Here's the Democratic Party caught rigging the primary against other Americans and blaming someone else to normalize the idea of violence to secure European oil markets
1834 2018-03-12 20:09:10 Just buy a big jar of coconut oil. The Jarrow brand is good.
1835 2018-03-12 20:09:05 Massive plate of grilled Mediterranean vegetables with quinoa, puy  lentils or brown rice, and maybe a wee cube or two of halloumi or feta, topped with a splash of really fab olive oil.

1840 2018-03-12 20:08:22 ..buffer zone in the southern region, bordering Syria. Much like when the US invaded Cuba to ‘protect’ itself. 3) the western allies have been aiming to grant independence to the Kurds in return to oil contracts and to keep the Russians at bay. With US support, the Kurds..
1841 2018-03-12 20:08:18 I use coconut oil.
1842 2018-03-12 20:08:04 Most of the comments on here are from sheep that follow along and try to keep their jobs in the gas and oil fields.
But there are those of us that see the future and aren't affraid of it and are pushing to get us off of dirty and poisonous fuels. Don't listen to the dullards.

1852 2018-03-12 20:06:46 People in Sugar Glider groups are fucking ate up, man. I used peppermint oil in the same room as them and people are freaking out about how it could POSSIBLY be bad for them. SMH.

1854 2018-03-12 20:06:12 Interesting results Ian. Might be worth trying burnishing an inked piece of paper against the wood? (If you get a gloopy result trying to take a transfer print - basically take a print from the print. Stand oil used to thin printing ink is a form of linseed oil incidentally)

1858 2018-03-12 20:05:04 CORRECTION: It's not the Saudi's. The Rothschilds basically control the oil flow out of Saudi Arabia. Research Genie Energy - there you will find a lot of the answers. Another company to research is Bechtel - they decide who gets elected in California. They run Saudi pipelines.
1859 2018-03-12 20:04:59 It made no sense to me. No plot. I also thought oil movie ended too early.

1862 2018-03-12 20:04:34 Had my car serviced Saturday, go to drive back to uni and the car starts chugging when I turn it on, to then find out they left the oil cap off after the service good one Halfords
1863 2018-03-12 20:04:26 It’s like reminding a goalie with 5 minutes left in the 3rd that he has a shutout going. Also law of averages too. The Oil just beat the Wild after losing 8 straight to them at home. But hey go Oilers.
1864 2018-03-12 20:04:25 Y’all love putting cocoa butter and coconut oil on y’all face until y’all start getting clogged pores 
1865 2018-03-12 20:04:15 It was so dead yesterday at work and now that it’s going to snow tonight everyone needs oil TODAY! Where were you YESTERDAY or the day before 
1866 2018-03-12 20:04:05 Except when he acts for big oil, big pharma, big guns, billionaires and, oh ya russia. So...thanks for the 1.60$/per week...guess he works cheap...or maybe he's got money in those interests. We would never know because he's refused to release his tax returns.

1869 2018-03-12 20:03:32 @Okbabyyt BABY HAIRS: try levering your hair in coconut oil every night before going to bed. Put your hair in a bun for the night then the next morning shower. Put shampoo in your hair once then rinse, put shampoo in your hair again and rinse.
1870 2018-03-12 20:03:20 That’s the stupidest argument (especially rich coming from Republicans). Following that logic we should just have shrug 9/11 (we killed a lot of Arabs/Muslims too) but instead we invaded the WRONG country.
Oil explains that as well as having Putin’s friend as Secretary of State
1871 2018-03-12 20:03:18 Again, that's a worst case scenario. Just like me stating that had Scotland voted yes in 2014 (worst case scenario) we'd be on our arses right about now, the economy in turmoil given the drop in oil & a government well out of their depth in their play school parliament.
1872 2018-03-12 20:02:44 Petroyuan more like it. Russia is the biggest producer of the world oil, for years Russia has been selling the oil via opec in usa, but now russia is beginning to sell in yuan thus damaging both US dollar and the pound.
1873 2018-03-12 20:02:37 .@Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!

1897 2018-03-12 20:00:19 The investigation is not over, so you in turn, cannot not confirm the allegations are false.  You are simply taking a shady con man at his word while Fox News does their best to distract and protect. I bet you have a hefty supply of snake oil in your garage.
1898 2018-03-12 20:00:15 I feel like I can't rise above this problem but God would anoint my head with oil and my cup shall run over
1899 2018-03-12 19:59:56 Arnold Schwarzenegger plans to sue oil companies for knowingly causing global warming which led to the deaths of countless people.  Still to be determined: where to file suit and make sense of this "must have standing" nonsense.
1900 2018-03-12 19:59:51 1. What does this have to do with Satanism?

1911 2018-03-12 19:58:00 Eventually I believe we won't be using oil anymore but I believe it's going to be a slow process as we change from one's energy source to another. If we go to fast people lose their jobs it could be a real mess it's sn evolutionary process.  It will happen but not overnight.
1912 2018-03-12 19:57:48 If you wash it everyday, I'd suggest to get hairfood or coconut oil.... but then moisturize you'll regain your string roots back... goodluck with your hair journey

1914 2018-03-12 19:57:30 It was so easy. I’ve still not replaced my broken scales so it was easier to measure the oil. 1 bowl, 1 whisk, 1 baking tin. So easy on the washing up too.

1925 2018-03-12 19:56:19 Gotta get my oil change
1926 2018-03-12 19:56:16 Got a big jar of coconut oil
1927 2018-03-12 19:56:15 The oil is a lubricant and is not being burned.  Coal emits carbon monoxide, lead, arsenic, sulfur dioxide, mercury, plus. When you add the equipment to scrub those chemicals, the cost of production goes way up. They want to shut down a coal burning plant down near me.
1928 2018-03-12 19:56:10 yea but like why does coconut oil have to smell like That
1929 2018-03-12 19:56:07 "I soon go to the place of my rest, pouring in oil and wine."
1930 2018-03-12 19:56:06 But consumers can't effectively drive the change to renewable energy if government subsidies, tax breaks, tariffs and regulations favor dirty energy like coal and oil, making them artificially profitable for corporations and their shareholders.
1931 2018-03-12 19:55:48 And Skippy is processed enough so that the peanut oil should not separate out, so this is just plain wrong
1932 2018-03-12 19:55:43 Seconded. Plenty of examples of countries around the world making serious pushes towards green energy&jobs. Building additional oil infrastructure/projects is unacceptable.
1933 2018-03-12 19:55:37 Governator may be hanging around with Maxine Waters a bit too much. So 202o Dem platform is "raise taxes, sue oil co's. for 'murder,' impeach 45, reparations (Waters again), illegals can vote, and cops are bad." GOOD! LORD! And they call me "deplorable?
1934 2018-03-12 19:55:33 They don't have a right to use this till they make the oil unhealthy and delicious again, and msg and whatnot
1935 2018-03-12 19:55:31 So about 50 million barrel of oil equivalent. bbOe?

1941 2018-03-12 19:54:44 U think coconut oil is mousturizing for ur face too? 
1942 2018-03-12 19:54:42 I think the wash is the only ferment still left. I've even stopped using sheet masks cause some of them were causing reactions or felt like burning (which turns out isn't good). 

I'll try to stick to the cleansing stick. I've got an oil cleanser in the mail too.
1943 2018-03-12 19:54:41 Big oil is no longer feeding him money, private jets, and SUVs.
1944 2018-03-12 19:54:32 Good stuff guys!

1950 2018-03-12 19:54:14 More like "Let's get more oil moving thru existing pipelines by subsidizing partial upgrading to remove need for diluent".
1951 2018-03-12 19:54:09 You always hold too many things constant....

We do not have overflowing oil. Nigeria has never been under a plunderous Mugabe for over 40 years
1952 2018-03-12 19:54:08 So it's literally just sitting oil. How is that a problem
1953 2018-03-12 19:54:07 Real mayo or butter works when you have that dried-out natural peanut butter from the bottom of the jar that the oil floated out of so some more fat is needed. But bacon and pickles with it is a firm NOPE
1954 2018-03-12 19:53:48 Now I gotta think twice about opening coconut oil from Amazon. Great.
1955 2018-03-12 19:53:35 i’m standing in fucking farm & fleet with no makeup on watching my dad get confused over oil and honestly i’ve never wanted to d*e more than I do right now holy shit

1967 2018-03-12 19:51:52 Like the way PDP kept theirs in 16 hopeless years abi? Roads, power, hospitals, water etc. Or 16 years wasn't enough for PDP to fix power ? Oil sold for over $100 for years  but PDP looted it all.
1968 2018-03-12 19:51:36 @Richieallenshow What sanctions could this Gov possible put on Russia that would bring them to heel?....Gm Crops? Pharmaceuticals? Oil/Gas? Industry?....Fuck all. Russia don't want em anyway!
1969 2018-03-12 19:51:31 I have a hair cut tomorrow and I just scheduled an oil change & tire rotation. Things are getting pretty adult-y around here.
1970 2018-03-12 19:51:31 Someone remix ‘Oil Spill’ from Bob’s Burgers for me lmao
1971 2018-03-12 19:51:26 Yes. “Oxygenated Olive oil” sounds like BS, not science, unless you can pint us to good studies? In what way is your product homeopathic?
1972 2018-03-12 19:51:22 NO to drilling offshore. Why would we want to spoil our coastlines with oil wells?

1974 2018-03-12 19:51:12 Different story there though. Didn't pay for stadium and club completely subsidised by oil money. There is no comparison frankly.
1975 2018-03-12 19:51:12 Why u beefing them innit they can be a retard if they want oil :/
1976 2018-03-12 19:51:09 Ok, I’m gonna say it....
“Oil be back!”
1977 2018-03-12 19:50:59 It's like you decided to make a cake. You got all the ingredients. You got the mix, the eggs, the milk, the oil and the pan. You lay it all out. Then you're like "Nah, I'm good." And you throw them all in the trash can. Then your hormones go crazy for a month. That's Plan B.
1978 2018-03-12 19:50:59 Notley's threat to cut off oil exports to B.C. a political gamble, says analyst
1979 2018-03-12 19:50:51 Most of the CCS is about EOR  (extracting more oil).
And 80% of the CO2 for EOR is from geological CO2. So extraction geological CO2 in one state, transporting it across a few states and inject it to extract more oil.
So relation climate change........
1980 2018-03-12 19:50:40 Hubs said he’d take my vehicle in for oil change over the weekend. He took his car in to be detailed instead. Now I have to take it in for oil change whilst feeling like death so thanks for that 
1981 2018-03-12 19:50:38 My nails getting long again. Wonder if its my CBD Oil 
1982 2018-03-12 19:50:37 Is that with the oil CDB?
1983 2018-03-12 19:50:30 Really? These cities think they can show global warming is affecting them and then show that these oil companies are to blame? The oil companies sell the oil not burn it. Oh but there is no money suing car drivers that burn it. How stupid lawyers spend their days in court
1984 2018-03-12 19:50:30 At the risk of stating the blindingly bloody obvious: 52% of the Russian Government's revenue comes from oil and gas = 70% of its export revenue. Want to thumb your nose at the Russian bear? Shift to renewables! #Skripal
1985 2018-03-12 19:50:27 Tillerson used to ran the largest oil company, surely he knows how to dress better. This is not a field trip but a city business meeting.
1986 2018-03-12 19:50:03 What an idiot. Conversion of Nat Gas into nitrogen fertilizer by Germans just one example of how fossil fuel use has enhanced humananity.
1987 2018-03-12 19:49:39 Oh nooooo. Pacifica has some really great oil free moisturizers. They’re actually the only oil free products I’ve used that feel like they actually, y’know, moisturize. Idk what causes your breakouts tho
1988 2018-03-12 19:49:32 Lavender has magical calming powers. Here are some ways to use it:

⁕ fill a diffuser with lavender essential oil
⁕ infuse a little into a chia pudding
⁕ dab it on your pillow before bed
1989 2018-03-12 19:49:23 So tomorrow... get contact lenses, vaping oil... go to primark...
1990 2018-03-12 19:49:16 .#Russia has only 3 exports: Oil, Vodka, & RadioActive poisons. The civilized world can live without them
1991 2018-03-12 19:49:14 "Our best days as a country" for who?  oh let me guess - white males. Not so good for women, blacks, Native Americans,....
1992 2018-03-12 19:49:02 No way Jose you’re the same size as an oil rig I’d lose
1993 2018-03-12 19:49:02 Mtlb malik can't be frnd of anyone because they are oil seller punjabi me misal ni suni hui kia ?
1994 2018-03-12 19:49:00 Ahahahaha once used anointing oil to fry plantain, never seen my mam so vexed in my loife
1995 2018-03-12 19:48:52 I’m not bad, I’m fed up of this crap weather now, I’ll be up to my ears in muck grease & oil all week servicing machinery
1996 2018-03-12 19:48:42 Every day I notice improvements while taking our oil.  My arthritis is better and less painful and my RLS is gone.
1997 2018-03-12 19:48:35 When prophet died ..by your concoction he should have been a billionaire ...you know ...his wife sold one of the weapons to buy oil to burn light and arrange his burial....not like a billionaire president or a corporate exploiter that you are trying to portray as good.
1998 2018-03-12 19:48:29 "the choice is not whether to hire a data scientist or a data translator as you are likely to need both" now consider:
- data gardner
- data trader / data trading platforms
or consider the job economy from the oil / energy market... further deepness to "data is the new oil"..
1999 2018-03-12 19:48:25 Do folk tweeting about Russia being cut off from the SWIFT payment system over UK spy incident, know what they are even suggesting?
It'd cause a complete economic meltdown in both Russia & the EU because Moscow would have to halt gas & oil exports.
How would they be paid for?
2000 2018-03-12 19:48:22 Me: Oh my god that smells amazing what are you cooking?
Flatmate: That’s literally just vegetable oil. #YouCanTakeTheBoyOutOfScotland
2001 2018-03-12 19:48:19 Olive oil is ambrosia on Earth tbh makes everything better LOL
2002 2018-03-12 19:48:11 Good. Always ONE among us that thinks they are better then everyone else.
2003 2018-03-12 19:48:11 Castor oil really works that’s how I have full brows now
2004 2018-03-12 19:48:00 hahaha not a clever way to avoid the question, @FairQuestions always ignores my questions re financing of oil pipeline supporters but is very keen on reporting funding of protests, extremely biased "reporting" IMO
2005 2018-03-12 19:47:55 I don't get it? The Arnold is thinking of suing oil companies. These oil comanies have allowed the world to become advanced in transportation for one thing. The use of natural gas for heating of homes another. We no longer heat homes world wide with coal.
2006 2018-03-12 19:47:26 I use rosehip oil every night after I wash and tone my face. It has been a saaaaavior through the winter months and I don’t plan on stopping
2007 2018-03-12 19:47:26 Two things you need over the door of your children's bedroom.

1. Oil from anointing 
2. A bobby pin

One keeps the devil out, the other lets you in.

This also works with the restroom.
2008 2018-03-12 19:47:25 Lunch scavenged from random bits: threw leftover chicken, some kalamata olives, garlic, and a couple stalks of asparagus in olive oil to sauté, then put that on top of spinach/cheese ravioli with some paragiana. *chefs kiss* post walk late lunch perfection.
2009 2018-03-12 19:47:09 "Cracked the code"?  A German restaurant was built in Huntsville due to all German engineers and scientists relocated there.  See "Operation Paperclip": 127 of them eventually entered the U.S.  Look at Huntsville voting - another blue area.
2010 2018-03-12 19:47:01 Actually::::: She called members of Trump’s cabinet w/ alleged ties to Russia “a bunch of scumbags” who only have interests in oil, gas & $$..."
2011 2018-03-12 19:46:56 Got a great morning workout, did my oil change and now eating ribs
2012 2018-03-12 19:46:48 Yes but you won't stand up to protect Canada's oil industry, why?  Cause you are useless and gutless.....cause we albertans don't vote for liberals!
2013 2018-03-12 19:46:42 This grape seed oil got my skin feeling like a baby dolphin!!..My new street name is "Flipper"..please address me as such.I will also answer to "Lil Flip" or "Trevi-Flip".

2015 2018-03-12 19:46:08 The Davis-Oliver bill will enhance cooperation with state, or don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
2016 2018-03-12 19:45:55 You have read the McCrone report and understand that successive UK Governments lied about the extent of Scottish oil reserves, this is a UK Government report?
2017 2018-03-12 19:45:55 Rocking up to the gym with oil in my hair looking like I haven’t washed it in at least 5 months
2018 2018-03-12 19:45:52 My first time taking my car to the shop by myself and I already hate this. Came just for an oil change and there’s apparently shit wrong with my battery and I don’t know enough about cars to tell whether they’re trying to pull one over on me or if they’re actually helping.
2019 2018-03-12 19:45:48 I wish they'd crack down on what restaurants can use! We have a healthy, natural food market that has a hot bar. They use olive oil. It's a great place to get a meal when you're in a hurry.
2020 2018-03-12 19:45:38 Kumi guitar's music career is like Ghana's crude oil, It will stay underground saa till Kuffuor discover him 
2021 2018-03-12 19:45:38 i what awards? Ughh, these are exhausting!!
2022 2018-03-12 19:45:35 I like the fact that my brother works at Hyundai. I can get my oil changes for free!
2023 2018-03-12 19:45:33 MASCOT: All northbound lanes on General Holmes Dr have reopened but 2 of 5 southbound lanes remain closed at Mill Pond Dr. A truck and car crash has caused an oil spill so exercise caution and expect delays.
2024 2018-03-12 19:45:31 I can still wait a few more weeks for oil change lol
2025 2018-03-12 19:45:29 THIS CAR STINKS LIKE OIL. BETTER TRY TO FIX IT WITH MY FARTS AND ASS STANK. *moans involentarily*
2026 2018-03-12 19:45:23 NO. NO MORE. No more oil, no more Tar Sands, no more refineries, no more economic B.S. WE ARE OUT OF TIME! WE NEED AIR & WATER - NOT OIL. #undrip #SiteC #bcpoli
2027 2018-03-12 19:45:16 Baker Institute is a NEOCON, oil company mouthpiece.  The board is filled not by Rice, but by special interests who pay to use the Rice name.  A truly disgusting sellout among the many sell outs lately.
2028 2018-03-12 19:45:08 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
2029 2018-03-12 19:44:57 If I want dominos I’ll cut out the middle man and bathe in salt and oil
2030 2018-03-12 19:44:47 Okay I'll do it with baby oil
2031 2018-03-12 19:44:42 When I was 3 years old I tried to cook an egg. I put it in a pan and turned it on high with no grease. My dad soon came to investigate what the stench was coming from the kitchen. He told me No!..you put it on medium!...and oil or butter or it will stick!  Been cooking ever since
2032 2018-03-12 19:44:36 i have semi-inadvertantly caused myself quite a lot of pain. i had water in my ears from swimming and dribbled some tea tree oil in them to get the water out. It worked, but now i have a hell of a left ear ache. the right side's fine.
2033 2018-03-12 19:44:30 about to play a prank on Luxaar involving oil. wonder how it'll go.
2034 2018-03-12 19:44:18 Sur le même registre....mise en place des réseaux de bus au gas oil en remplacement des voies de chemin de fer non entretenues
2035 2018-03-12 19:44:12 All race cars burn oil 
2036 2018-03-12 19:44:11 Some might say too often they have lost a sense the choice we make it easier for Exxon to explore for oil.
2037 2018-03-12 19:43:41 I think it is time, after 12 years as a C++ game developer working on the biggest games, to share some of my top secrets to success. Here we go:

(1). Use baby oil in shower to make your skin feel awesome and not dry during winter.
2038 2018-03-12 19:43:30 @LukeCoutinho17 for cooking food which oil do u recommend?
2039 2018-03-12 19:43:24 Worked with the tobacco companies. Go for it. Someone needs to leak the old notes of Nikola Tesla.(where ever they are stashed away)Screw Big Oil. Time to start a new democratic system everywhere. Accountability is key.
2040 2018-03-12 19:43:23 I legit do not ask them ANYTHING about the mechanics of my car/details on my car(type of oil, etc) or listen to their advice. 10/10 times they’re wrong

2046 2018-03-12 19:42:48 You going to get free land. With higher taxes, higher imports for oil and higher vat for goods. Oh wait and no food? Well done! And what you going to lease it? Anyways, ANC told the Moody's that they will not damage investment or food secuirty. The moment they do! Cheers mate.
2047 2018-03-12 19:42:44 Randall: And don’t get is twisted sis , I wake up every morning next to a head scarf and coconut oil. I’m married to a BLACK QUEEN  @SterlingKBrown
2048 2018-03-12 19:42:40 I did like Gov @Schwarzenegger but his latest idea is foolish.
California is facing big funding issues. California should pump oil, tax it, pay off debt, and lower taxes.
2049 2018-03-12 19:42:40 The Petro is backed by reserves of Venezuelan wealth (gold,oil,gas and diamonds). This cryptocurrency is administrated by the government.
2050 2018-03-12 19:42:30 Charlie got an oil change, inspection, and a car wash. I take care of my man #Charliethecherokee
2051 2018-03-12 19:42:25 Why in the hell have i been here for 2.5 hrs just for an oil change ?!

2053 2018-03-12 19:42:06 applied some castor oil on my hair 'cause apparently it makes your hair grow, let's pray for it to be true bc my hair takes forever to grow 
2054 2018-03-12 19:41:50 Some of our best memories are from when you were Bald. I have a video of you slathering your head in coconut oil in my room while jamming to the naked brothers.

2057 2018-03-12 19:41:14 Of course! We have all relied on oil resources for several decades; evolving to and accepting a more global friendly (cleaner) and effective source will take time..
2058 2018-03-12 19:40:47 Drawings for a mountain scene. Oil on A4 paper.

2066 2018-03-12 19:40:01 Ok I’m going to live tweet my experience of taking CBD oil pills and no you do not get high off of cbd oil as it is not psycho active and doesn’t contain thc which is what gets you stoned
2067 2018-03-12 19:40:01 I worked at an olive oil store (that admittedly might have been a front) and ppl would always pass by saying “this plane is still open?!”
2068 2018-03-12 19:39:53 An hour wait to get my oil changed on the jeep, time for a nap
2069 2018-03-12 19:39:48 aloe vera & tea tree oil <3
2070 2018-03-12 19:39:35 Oil: The U.S. will overtake Russia to become the world’s largest oil producer by 2023, according to the International Energy Agency, reflecting Trump administration policies such as approving major oil pipelines, opening up areas to drilling and regulation reform.
2071 2018-03-12 19:39:32 Jobs like coal and oil where the backbone of the country but the industries aren't bad but outdated technology has outpaced them.  The same type of transition happened when they started using coal and oil.  It destroyed outdated industry.
2072 2018-03-12 19:39:19 I’m listening to a commodities PM who had dinner last week with the both the president and Secretary General of OPEC, he’s saying their biggest concern right now is capital investment into long term platforms for oil production....very interesting
2073 2018-03-12 19:39:17 yeah, like how can you stand having residue on your face & that oil that comes with it lol
2074 2018-03-12 19:39:05 @MineralDoc I'm being totally amazed at another 'natural' product. Cannabis Oil now being used to help epilepsy, Parkinson's Disease, tumours and more?? #MotherNature knows best I am finding!

#smartnetworking
2075 2018-03-12 19:38:59 ?????? Your words are meaningless to me. The only snake oil salesmen I know about are in DC. Trump is this snake oil salesman. Your words are old words. This is 2018, so if you want to be understood, use new words, not old ones. I did not vote for Trump, and never would have.
2076 2018-03-12 19:38:58 And oil is thicker than all three! Actually I’m not sure what that proves but there you go...
2077 2018-03-12 19:38:56 Mtry using coconut oil or shea butter a a night cream
2078 2018-03-12 19:38:48 Bill those twrilly things can't operate without oil, giant gearbox holding 200 to 300 gallons of oil!!!!  Coal is the best for making  power.
2079 2018-03-12 19:38:45 This coming from the dude that has videos of him pouring scalding hot oil on his microdick
2080 2018-03-12 19:38:33 Today I learned that it is VERY hard to put oil in your car without a funnel. 10/10 don't recommend
2081 2018-03-12 19:38:15 Does it still get crispy like frying it in oil ?
2082 2018-03-12 19:38:12 Your tweet is completely ridiculous. Alberta's carbon resources are a great gift to Canada from God. 
Let me guess you support @JustinTrudeau. In China they derisively call him "little potato"
So, if Canada does not pump oil the U.S. will. Thanks for the gift of profit.
2083 2018-03-12 19:37:35 All done would love to go back to HK...the place where I fell in love with Lee Kum Kee especially the Chiu Chow Chilli Oil
2084 2018-03-12 19:37:20 Russia has 24 hours to respond to the UK or else...

What? What are we going to do? They have a huge nuclear and military arsenal at their disposal so there can't be direct action. Sanctions are pointless as, again, they have guns and they have oil. We have nothing! Give up!
2085 2018-03-12 19:37:13 Oh
 Nooo. Oil finish
2086 2018-03-12 19:37:11 Killing white people and seizing land will surely alleviate problems. 
2087 2018-03-12 19:37:06 American journalists are terrorists

NATO is for invading foreign countries that aren't a threat to us but who have oil that we want

Al Qaeda are moderate rebels and our allies

We can blame any foreign power for acts of terrorism without providing evidence

What happened?
2088 2018-03-12 19:36:53 Omo see Alex dropping tears like crude oil in Oloibiri. #BBNaija .

2091 2018-03-12 19:36:22 Go electric and never worry about engine oil again.
2092 2018-03-12 19:36:09 I wanna be able to share coconut oil with my wife
2093 2018-03-12 19:36:04 Beto knows the how to go through the motions of being a Progressive, but it's all snake oil. I heard recently he was a fundraiser in New York with none other than Chuck Schumer.
2094 2018-03-12 19:35:53 anyone have recommendations on essential oil companies cheaper than young living that don’t suck?
2095 2018-03-12 19:35:48 This is a fun season overall! I especially like the one where Robert Patrick teams up with a certain someone on an oil rig
2096 2018-03-12 19:35:31 I appreciate the removal of palm oil to protect uranguntans and the environment, but the biscuits no longer taste nice and are much smaller than they used to be. Disappointed.
2097 2018-03-12 19:35:21 I need an oil change, my inspection is up and I need new tires..... why does everything go at once ? 
2098 2018-03-12 19:35:20 I need clary sage essential oil
2099 2018-03-12 19:35:18 "Paleo salesperson" lol and just who did she 'sell out' to? Who would benefit most from influencing people to believe veg oil is amazing? Veg oil manufacturers... but of course, there can't be any conflict interests there
2100 2018-03-12 19:35:11 46 (3-12): #Earthquakes in southern #Kansas linked to #oil, #gas production. #hydraulic_fracturing #wastewater_injection
2101 2018-03-12 19:35:05 You like Plant Therapy, too?  *makes note*.  I think the carrier oil I bought was actually Plant Therapy.  Fractionated coconut
2102 2018-03-12 19:35:03 #DidYouKnow Contrary to popular belief, sunbathing makes spots worse. The temporary drying effect and the blemish-concealing tan may fool you, but UV rays actually stimulate oil production. Always choose a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher! 
2103 2018-03-12 19:34:48 Trump didn't lower taxes for anyone except billionaires. Why is he selling our native American's land and water? Our national parks to oil companies and pipelines? Why did he kill solar energy? He is just as bad as Hillary- worse in some ways. He only helps CORPORATIONS.
2104 2018-03-12 19:34:38 งงมากๆ
2105 2018-03-12 19:34:33 I also think that in the addiction and recovery industry there's a lot of well meaning people inadvertently peddling snake oil. It's very easy to let belief trump evidence in fields like that. The self-perpetuation thing isn't necessarily malicious.
2106 2018-03-12 19:34:14 Worked 7 hours, drove 2 hours, got a job lined up for summer, got my teeth cleaned, an oil change, and new glasses. And this was all on 1 lone hour of sleep. NAP TIME BABY, what a day

2109 2018-03-12 19:33:41 No veggies? If you have seasoning and oil, you can make a dressing for it.
2110 2018-03-12 19:33:39 You need to use oil before shampooing your hair.
2111 2018-03-12 19:33:34 Red currant jelly is amazing on meat! But Chili oil is great on curry... Hmm which one is the best..?
2112 2018-03-12 19:33:28 You must be some oil painting.
2113 2018-03-12 19:33:26 Ive had coconut oil on my hair for like 7 hours am gonna be so soft 
2114 2018-03-12 19:33:22 I use cetaphil cleanser! And then acne dote for toner at night after cleansing! In the mornings cleanse and moisturize with oil free clean and clear moisturizer BUT what really keeps it clear for me is a mild chemical peel from a doctor

2116 2018-03-12 19:32:58 Yes. Putin controls Kim given that he is offloading oil and who know what else on to North Korean ships. Kim, besides Trump, will do what he says.
2117 2018-03-12 19:32:56 Next thing Trump did was go to poland to the 3 seas summit and tell eastern europe he'll sell them energy and they can become independent of putin and his oil politics. This immediately gave Trump leverage over Russia
2118 2018-03-12 19:32:51 Yes along with his fundamentalist Christian army bullshit, live of oil and absolute hatred of anything remotely socialist.

Y'all can (with great reasons)  discuss about how Beto is less than ideal. But he does support transitioning into clean energy. 

No one said he's perfect.
2119 2018-03-12 19:32:50 Nothing but meaningless grand standing. The idea of suing oil country for 1st degree murder is so stupid, I'm surprised even in CA it would be tried. Failed against fun mfgs after all. Water of money, private and public. Just another death rattle from a dying state
2120 2018-03-12 19:32:46 (2) Ghanaian economy growing at over 8%?! Oil reserves will do that. This @nytimes article leads me to believe Ghana will be be more evidence of the difference between GDP and quality of life. #neoliberaleconomicsfailagain
2121 2018-03-12 19:32:41 Stop to sell gun and stop to drill oil.
2122 2018-03-12 19:32:15 After 3 years of the oil industry being kicked around and spit on in Alberta, I have never seen a message like this for that industry? Funny isn’t it?
2123 2018-03-12 19:32:08 And the fees for this? And reconnection? Again $58 dollars overdue.... Close to %100? In MARCH? Bad enough I get gouged at every turn as a law abiding tax paying citizen. Very disappointed.
2124 2018-03-12 19:31:56 you know there’s vegetable oil in there?!? 
2125 2018-03-12 19:31:46 Jamaican Castor Oil & Moroccan Argan Oil to keep my hair growing and healthy while I maintain this ugly picky afro stage trying to grow these dreads
2126 2018-03-12 19:31:32 Get the oil to market.
2127 2018-03-12 19:31:27 Fuzzy memory tells me they were oil damaged Steve-Daves? How’d that happen? 
2128 2018-03-12 19:31:25 Anybody got any tips for getting rid of dandruff when you have color in your hair??? I feel so gross and I feel like tea tree oil made it worse but idk
2129 2018-03-12 19:31:24 Alaskans own 69,000 shares of CANADIAN ENERGY SERVICES &TECH, worth $377,168. It's from the OIL SERVICES sector, based in CANADA.

2133 2018-03-12 19:30:48 Bumble and bumble invisible oil
Blow dry 
Straighten any kinks left that you want straightened
Use some more of the oil on the ends of your hair for some extra sheen and protection.
2134 2018-03-12 19:30:40 Likewise! But I'm fine with olive oil, go figure.
2135 2018-03-12 19:30:30 It's fine I'll use Amla oil 
2136 2018-03-12 19:30:28 Wow!! Thank you definitely will try the #Industri -oil Martini
2137 2018-03-12 19:30:27 the aroma was VERY strong! even for me, an essential oil girl!

2143 2018-03-12 19:29:52 Trump is a traitor to America and her allies-Trump only wants the Russian oil money promised by Putin and will sell our America to get it
2144 2018-03-12 19:29:45 We're selling arms to the Saudis because, after 60 years of buying their oil, it would be petty & hypocritical to stop selling them & let the French supply them instead. I really pity our future : Labour want to borrow to spend like water - at the same time as killing our markets
2145 2018-03-12 19:29:40 Cry. Palm. Game. Oil. Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then everything changed when the Game Nation attacked
2146 2018-03-12 19:29:16 Alberta's special treatment of its oil and gas related emissions will be the ultimate undoing of the national reductions program.

Jump the shark much?  How’s those oil paved roads u drive on? Shingles on ur roof? Your tennis shoes, private jet, chap stick, wife’s lipstick. U think ur money buys immunity? Carbon credits. What a Joke.
2149 2018-03-12 19:28:38 @TheGooglsnarf u will never get ur oil
2150 2018-03-12 19:28:35 @animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
2151 2018-03-12 19:28:29 I think that chick made the Farsali face oil every instagram makeup model uses 
2152 2018-03-12 19:28:13 A typical piece of poorly researched, sensationalist journalism. #Oil and #gas companies have provided the #energy demanded by #society for over a century and, as energy companies, many are embracing new energy #technology as well as working responsibly to enhance the old.
2153 2018-03-12 19:28:07 It starts at home fool. A person can’t sue the oil industry for murder when you fly private jets & proudly drove a Hummer. Does he have a Prius  He also compares the oil industry to big tobacco  ...Arnold also is a huge cigar smoker ! He’s a Hollywood #phony
2154 2018-03-12 19:28:06 Around 9/11 I became #Exvangelical because I realized the main goal was antisemitism. Some of that antisemitic fervor was in the service of the oil war, but some of it wasn't.

Not sure #EmptyThePews is quite right for me, though. I'm devoutly UU.
2155 2018-03-12 19:27:59  knew I should’ve gassed up last night I don’t have anything but oil at the crib

2162 2018-03-12 19:27:10 We can get gas elsewhere, ah fcuk it! Back to plan a, invade Russia, stick  in the ground and take the oil, sell Chelsea F.C. to Salford United, pop tariffs on our new found oil to the EU and restart the empire! Woohoo 
2163 2018-03-12 19:26:57 Hi Melissa just watched Omars vlog about his RV problems. Hubby is engineer on Royal Navy submarines. He said oil problem maybe the piston rings need changing or a general oil leak but start with piston rings or piston scraper rings. If he changes them it should fix@Melissa_wife
2164 2018-03-12 19:26:39 Not sure.. this is from the company that did the emergency call out the other week and slapped the comdemned sticker on the tank.. so we can't have the old one filled... we have oil for about a week left now .. Waiting to hear back from the others we've requested quotes from..

2168 2018-03-12 19:26:04 Trump reminds me of the old timey Snake Oil Salesmen who exploits the public with his products and fake cures.
2169 2018-03-12 19:26:03 Give him his oil back. Nobody needs those kind of problems
2170 2018-03-12 19:25:58 Shit baby, according to Donny, Kim Jong Un is so scared of transloading oil from Russian and Chinese supertankers that he is being forced to the bargaining table. Riiight!
2171 2018-03-12 19:25:55 Getting carnival ready is hard I have to exfoliate my body every other day and rub down from head to toe in a natural skin therapy oil. MI cah badda

2174 2018-03-12 19:25:02 You could start with the oil companies and go on down the scale to energy and water providers etc. not to mention other government outsourced functions.

2178 2018-03-12 19:24:09 Like oil and waterrrr
2179 2018-03-12 19:24:09 Not true!  A lot of "libs" that I know (incl me) question the of the Dept of Educ.  Not happy with "common core" curriculum.  But what about those states that are very far behind (Ark, MS, AL) and have no desire to catch up?

2184 2018-03-12 19:23:26 For an active panic attack, it's sniff and rub - usually diluted by a carrier oil or lotion.  You can also diffuse with either a cold air mister or reeds.
2185 2018-03-12 19:23:15 Well, we can hope that these upcoming governments have some common sense. Oil and Gas production funds a lot of programs.

2189 2018-03-12 19:23:03 Good luck with that Arnie.  Proof is needed and there isn’t any proof that oil companies cause global warming.
2190 2018-03-12 19:23:01 $TRCH moving up but volume is weak. Maybe it's on the way back up w/ some news pending. Break $1.38 - 50k shares and it could go. #oil

2197 2018-03-12 19:21:49 I do olive oil,salt, pepper, and balsamic, and let it marinate a bit the grill it’s 
2198 2018-03-12 19:21:48 I'm tryna grow my hair, so I need some suggestions on oil I should use to put in it.
2199 2018-03-12 19:21:35 So nice that you are willing to consign your fellow citizens to die in another futile regime change war, to remove a secular leader and install Salafist lunatics for the profit of oil men and Israel.
2200 2018-03-12 19:21:15 It’s just eggs and oil! I used to dislike it but it’s grown on me

2202 2018-03-12 19:20:35 Right! Those rats and mice were adorable! I couldn't help laugh during those scenes. I didn't think the show was complete trash, not good mind you but not trash. Also yeah, where was the oil thing going?

2206 2018-03-12 19:19:45 I hope that Arnie does his research. If he can prove that "big oil" caused Lake Missoula to disappear 15,000 years ago then he has a case. Lake Missoula was caused by global warming but it sure wasn't from Native Indians lighting fires or driving around in Hummers. Arnie is ill.
2207 2018-03-12 19:19:40 Of course we will , no matter what happens to the green policies. Trump is the one who wants the oil to be number one instead of green. Bull$hit
2208 2018-03-12 19:19:12 Yeah CBD hemp oil does wonders
2209 2018-03-12 19:18:59 Wb the oil

2214 2018-03-12 19:18:23 @bWoStevie you eat a lot of potatoes? I just started eating 3-4 a day cooked in a pan with oil olive. I respect your opinion and was curious on your thoughts on potatoes.
2215 2018-03-12 19:18:21 The global "conveyor", of which the Gulf Stream is a part has been slowing since the 1930s.  It has noting to do with "the Gulf filling up with oil", (which it's not doing anyway).

2226 2018-03-12 19:16:53 @saxmagc93 Trump is what he is! He’s pro oil! Obama is pro oil, but talks like he’s green! He gave a big green speech at the Paris accord, than signed permits for big oil to drill in the arctic! Environmentally the worst place to drill, Who’s worse?
2227 2018-03-12 19:16:47 You had to put a pan under it to catch the oil every time you parked it. Salesman laughed one time when I asked about the leaks. Said it was just marking its territory.

2233 2018-03-12 19:15:43 I would agree if we were to replace offshore oil (imported into Eastern Canada) with bitumen upgraded in Alberta and transported to Eastern refineries. We wouldn’t need any new pipelines if we were to do that. We also need to generate more #cleanenergy if we are to #ActOnClimate
2234 2018-03-12 19:15:41 Well 160$ later I have a new tire & got my oil changed. I hate this car. Gonna be broke until this weekend.
2235 2018-03-12 19:15:40 I wonder how she is adjusting to the lifestyle change. To know that you’ll never do the same normal things you’ve always done… pick up groceries at the supermarket, call-out for pizza or get the oil changed on the car. Not that it’s a big loss, but it’s definitely a change.
2236 2018-03-12 19:15:35 Collusion old news long b4 2016. 2011-14, Putin’s oil $ polluted Britain & US Republicans. Deutsche Bank $laundering, Trump $laundering, Russian produced $laundered B-movie “London Falls” & superior John LeCarre response, “Our Kind of Traitor.”
2237 2018-03-12 19:15:34 So now the Chinese kid to come into Alaska for the natural gas and oil while we Alaskan taxpayers pay corporate welfare to them and they bring in their own workers via the new airport your building and Alaskans will not get work but we will pay for corporate welfare for China
2238 2018-03-12 19:15:30 To claim that horse manure is the reason for the horseless carriage is a far stretch! But to claim a billion cars and trucks burning the cheapest fuel available! Unleaded gas,acid Rain! Isn't affecting air quality?Is the same as trying to coverup Oil spill or prevent the clean up
2239 2018-03-12 19:15:23 Trump is what he is! He’s pro oil! Obama is pro oil, but talks like he’s green! He gave a big green speech at the Paris accord, than signed permits for big oil to drill in the arctic! Environmentally the worst place to drill, Who’s worse?
2240 2018-03-12 19:15:14 Seconds ago, Mitch McConnell allowed oil drilling in Jake Tapper, but you were too distracted by Trump's tweets to notice.
2241 2018-03-12 19:15:11 That’s correct. Saudi of all the actors would not want more oil on wrld mkts, suppressing price before IPO. Cheap oil is good for our economies.

2244 2018-03-12 19:14:44 They are our lands not gas and oil. Keep our public lands. 
2245 2018-03-12 19:14:34 Of course he didn't. It's all about the to him. Coal, oil, decimating protected lands to drill for bullshit that ends with money in their pockets. I don't now how people do not see this!!!! They don't care about natives or poc period. #Greeeeeeeeeeeeed runs politics!
2246 2018-03-12 19:14:28 We should use nuclear waste in bombs !!! Drop that on the middle east !! It wont irradiate the oil either so its a win win

2248 2018-03-12 19:13:53 actually sir, you are mistaken. I would call your attention to 1. Gen Wesley Clark speech in Cali 2007 where he asked "what's our endgame in the ME?" and 2. Leviathan oil pipeline & Genie Oil 
yes it's a tragedy but all planned out

2250 2018-03-12 19:13:38 Gw Bush violated the Agreed Framework by stopping fuel oil shipments and the no threat clause by the axis of evil speech coupled by the preemption doctrine used in Iraq.

2254 2018-03-12 19:13:18 CBD oil is super helpful as well! It's just too expensive for me to use regularly so I've been using peppermint and lavender oil.

2258 2018-03-12 19:12:54 I was literally trembling on the phone just trying to make an oil change appointment 
2259 2018-03-12 19:12:49 I agree with this. But politicians are bought by Big Oil (and NRA)
2260 2018-03-12 19:12:41 Schwarzenegger wants to sue oil companies for knowing the long term impact of fossil fuel.. but nevermind Mansanto, Nickel miners, Computer hardware manufacturers for their foreseen e-waste, mfg and half life of plastics, etc.
2261 2018-03-12 19:12:36 I’m getting an oil change for my BMW and they have called me to the back 18 separate times to ask me where something is or how to do it. At this point, I might as well change the oil myself.
2262 2018-03-12 19:12:31 My main concern for the #SalishSea is Alberta’s oil and gas sector hoping to have its dangerous diluted bitumen processed in China via super tankers. A single spill would force BC’s orcas into extinction and deal a massive blow to BC’s tourism and fishing industry. #StopKM
2263 2018-03-12 19:12:25 --this forsaken bond so interested.

A human hustled about, obviously preparing for the place to open. Dough lay cut and prepped on the steel surface beside heating vats of oil, and it struck him so hard he almost fell off his feet. @bladedancedhamp liked beignets, right?--
2264 2018-03-12 19:12:03 My favorite remedy for my endometriosis is using peppermint oil. Usually I'll heat up a damp rag, apply the peppermint oil, put the hot rag on top, and then cover it with aluminum foil to keep the heat in! And I use peppermint on my  lower back too. Very helpful!
2265 2018-03-12 19:12:02 CAN AARON GET TO SEB ASAP PLEASE SEB IS ON HIS OWN WITH A PAN FULL OF OIL
2266 2018-03-12 19:11:54 You have to feel hugely sorry for Russian people. Life expectancy for a man fell to 55 in early 90s with end of USSR. Since then, despite record oil prices and abundant mineral wealth, its people exploited by billionaire oligarch class in hock with state. They deserve better.
2267 2018-03-12 19:11:52 Big OIl has known about climate change for more than 50 years. Time to hold them liable!

2276 2018-03-12 19:10:58 Thank you for protecting the beautiful coastline of Maryland. We don't need oil spills. #45 tried to get Scotland not to place wind turbines in the ocean off his golf course, but lost that battle. But he thinks it's okay to drill for oil of MD. Thank you again, Mr. AG.
2277 2018-03-12 19:10:44 Brad Wall "totally support[s]" Alberta's threat to restrict oil and gas flow to BC. "Alberta you gotta do this"

Obama gave speeches where he’d talk & talk about green energy, then sign permits 4 shell to drill in the arctic! I have less respect for Obama

2292 2018-03-12 19:09:03 When you understand it's the same theory behind most "homeopathic" medicine (aka snake oil) you'll make the connection between DeVos (Amway supplements,  less is more) and her educational theory (less is more). Education as effective as Oscillococcinum in other words, not at all.

2297 2018-03-12 19:08:33 Without the proper training it would’ve been frightening for those people. Oil workers who take helicopters regularly have this type of training the typical passenger has no idea.

2319 2018-03-12 19:06:07 So is your position that the elections have no bearing on the timing of an agreement on revenue sharing and oil marketing? Or that analysts have been narrowly focused on the airport when they discuss the prospects for "a deal" and aren't really focused on the other stuff?
2320 2018-03-12 19:06:07 Ok, then you will raise your sales tax to 9.75% on everything...including groceries...then you have to figure out how you will get the tourist revenue enjoyed by TN and FL or oil revenue for TX.

2339 2018-03-12 19:02:58 Putting took Crimea for oil. He gained title to all offshore drilling rights for gas and oil. To kick Russian separates ass back to the border. Would probably bring the Russians to the table. Because Crimea  would be next.
2340 2018-03-12 19:02:58 Of course, Putin has something on Trump but he is just enjoying these sanctions, he is loving the increased oil production In America under Trump.... #DesperateMegyn
2341 2018-03-12 19:02:55 Russia did not assassinate Litvinenko,, did not send troops into Ukraine, did not send oil to N. Korea, did not shoot down a civil airplane, did not dope most of its Olympic athletes, did not bibe FiFA officials. In fact it is all a Western conspiracy. Putin said so.

•Diamonds form under pressure,

•Olives are pressed to release oil,

•Seeds grow in darkness,

Whenever you feel crushed, under pressure, pressed, in darkness, you’re in a powerful place of transformation/ transmutation

2382 2018-03-12 18:59:27 Why bother expand a costly form of extracting oil & gas when the U.S. can bully down poor Canadian crude prices with limited access to other markets. Only if we could step on stage as a global competitor! #laythepipe #oilandgas #TransCanada #energyeast
2383 2018-03-12 18:59:21 Trump se burla de Hillary, de Bernie Sanders y Obama, de varios países incluído México, de deportistas, periodistas, mujeres y hasta minusvalidos. Creo que a estas alturas la burla de ese niño malcriado no es ninguna descalificación.
2384 2018-03-12 18:59:16 Loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ!
2385 2018-03-12 18:59:09 @MMAXXXOFFICIAL I have to say. I think I’m in love with your new referee @lexyyxxx! She is so damn hot!! Perhaps she and Harmony Reigns can have an oil wrestle in the octagon to decide who is the best ref?! 
2386 2018-03-12 18:58:44 My guys over at Lidrivio olive oil are an awesome pair. Mike and George are hands down the best business representatives I have ever met and I have been lucky to be a part of their growing company.
2387 2018-03-12 18:58:36 Most of it I see in long term oversold sectors like Miners and oil and gas stocks.  It appears stealth accumulation is happening.  Don't believe the hype that institutions are not buying. I'm seeing more signs of that they are. They are just not trying to be aggressive yet.

2389 2018-03-12 18:58:04 After almost a year i gotta change the oil on my machine.. and it looks like it’s gonna be a bitch
2390 2018-03-12 18:58:02 @PainNewsNetwork has anyone tried using the CBD oil for their pain? If so did it show the thc on a dug screen? Did it work for anyone? I wish Marijuana was legal here in Tn. I could not take all the meds I'm on for seizures, blood pressure, and pain meds I believe
2391 2018-03-12 18:57:58 “mom, I really think this CBD oil would help you.” 
my mom- “I could be baptized in that CBD oil and it wouldn’t save me. I’m a lost cause.”  bitch ok
2392 2018-03-12 18:57:52 Crude oil? 
2393 2018-03-12 18:57:26 I do not use olive oil. I put the kosher salt directly on the steak thick as crust for about 45 mins and leave it on the counter. After 45 mins, I rinse the steak of all salt and dry it as best I can with pepper towel.
2394 2018-03-12 18:57:16 Whats the big deal about the NRA spending money to help elect anyone, don't the oil companys spend even triple that amount to help elect who they want in office. Get off it you bunch of socialist or commies this is America and helping by donating money is how it is, "BIG DEAL"!!!
2395 2018-03-12 18:57:14 NOPE. Oil money goes to Oil Barrons
2396 2018-03-12 18:57:01 of course,, our oil and gas and the discount is needed by Pakistan . as the USA stop giving them money for nothing
2397 2018-03-12 18:56:57 Need AZ oil
2398 2018-03-12 18:56:53 Russia supplies most of europe with natural gas like a monopoly. The European have very few other suppliers, especially Germany. They also supply much of its oil. They also sell almost as many weapons that the US does.
2399 2018-03-12 18:56:53 My assumption is that right now seizing the real estate and stopping the oil shipments hurts Russia more than the West. Good thing winter is over.
2400 2018-03-12 18:56:43 blah blah blah. I was told in the 70s that we would run out of oil by 2000 and we would have flying cars. Burn it up. then introduce another better form of Energy. I want Elon to Mine He3 and build a fusion reactor to ebb the climate change debate
2401 2018-03-12 18:56:42 What an inspiring panel of African women speaking at our report launch, Digging Deep, at @UN_CSW, learning about the hidden and shocking impact of the oil industry on women in #Uganda. Women never see any of the compensation #ruralwomen #HearHerVoice #CSW62
2402 2018-03-12 18:56:35 Flooding the MARKET with OIL will crash the PRICE and mean less money - not doing it for any Environmental reasons
2403 2018-03-12 18:56:32 Easiest is just to toss in garlic, olive oil , salt & pepper & roast at 400 for about 30 mins.
2404 2018-03-12 18:56:28 Y THO Y is an oil change $50?!

2408 2018-03-12 18:55:50 You are the Mossad but I'll save you the trouble. This one was Putin+China+Bibi (but he's caught, not you guys)+some oil countries in the ME. OC all the way.
2409 2018-03-12 18:55:48 No no you misunderstand what Dems stand for. @SenWarren will STAND UP & FIGHT for the rights of indigenous people to not have their FEELINGS HURT with name calling!

Just not when indigenous people are PHYSICALLY ASSAULTED for defending their sovereign land from oil profiteers.
2410 2018-03-12 18:55:38 How is this in any way responding to what I wrote? You've just changed the subject twice now. As for your last point, which contains several fallacies, Canada/Alberta are in debt despite the "money" made by private oil & after decades, no alternative ideas growing out of that $$.
2411 2018-03-12 18:55:34 No, no, you turn right after oil lamp factory where all the children work.
2412 2018-03-12 18:55:26 @ritual I know the peppermint insert is to fight the fishy-ness of the oil, but it would be great if we could get some flavor insert options! Even if it's just spearmint vs peppermint. Could be a surprise to see which flavor you get!
2413 2018-03-12 18:55:24 The bankers and the real estate people in Mayfair, Belgravia, Chelsea and Knightsbridge love them some oligarch but with the low oil prices and the sanctions the cash isn't flowing quite so freely and Putin really couldn't afford to get that sloppy.
2414 2018-03-12 18:55:19 Get ready for a life of pain cause that's what curly hair is, get coconut oil so it's easier to comb if you have trouble
2415 2018-03-12 18:55:08 Col-oh-RAY-do City (on the Col-oh-RAH-do River). My dad, who drove all over most of south and west Texas in his oil company marketing job, always laughed about that one.
2416 2018-03-12 18:55:00 There's no real reason to put flavour enhancers in food other than to make processed food more attractive than natural. Emulsifiers bind fat to oil, stop separation of the product and cause human fat cells to to bloat. They don't need to be in the food chain.
2417 2018-03-12 18:55:00 Ready covered in oil??

2420 2018-03-12 18:54:51 They are all dripping in AIPAC and Middle East oil money

2423 2018-03-12 18:54:10 Gotta do my oil change by today, I keep procrastinating smh 
2424 2018-03-12 18:54:03 Not sure why now, but I do know that in the 60s when oil was first discovered, the cartel of Big Oil wanted to set up in Dundee due to having deep water port; Dundee rejected it so they came up the coast to Aberdeen for main hub.

2429 2018-03-12 18:53:40 Why glut the Market with oil. Leave ours for the Next Century.
2430 2018-03-12 18:53:40 FFS. The US buys our oil at a discount and then sells it at a profit. Why do you think they are paying idiots to Protest it. Tou think they are worried about THE ENVIRONMENT give me a break. US will be exporting 4 million Barrles a day soon. Where are those protests?
2431 2018-03-12 18:53:38 Good luck!! Just make sure you dilute it with some coconut oil so it spreads better.
2432 2018-03-12 18:53:20 I know it does. But no-one can be perfectly vegan. It's about doing your best to avoid minimizing suffering. The animals in oil have already suffered.  Obviously, if I could avoid using all fossil fuels I would. Wouldn't we all? 

Leather seats are unnecessary. Fuel isn't!
2433 2018-03-12 18:53:19 @CPSFuels Thank you for your delivery of oil this morning as promised. Efficient as always.

2442 2018-03-12 18:52:09 My student missed class because their car needed an oil change and their breakfast gave them diarrhea

2445 2018-03-12 18:51:51 It also means being prepared for another oil shock, peak oil, or just avoiding nightmare climate change. Putin shows every sign of short term, profit driven neocon type thinking in comparison.

2449 2018-03-12 18:51:14 What about when you finally decide to grow up but can’t get a decent job because you’re a felon? No diploma/GED. Relying on oil field work obviously ain’t the way to go either.
2450 2018-03-12 18:51:09 Yeah I have the Clinique moisture surge intense moisturiser that I use morning and night after rosehip oil. But my foundation and concealer still cling to dry patches, yet I haven't mixed them with the moisturiser so I could try that!

2457 2018-03-12 18:50:28 Note to self...only use my tea tree oil before bed or on no makeup days and not under foundation... I've never seen my foundation separate so quick. Idk how people use primer oil and other oil base primers or skincare before applying makeup...btw the shape tape foundation rocks!

2459 2018-03-12 18:50:11 I just made, to go with lasagna, blanched baby kale; then, I doused it with olive oil and a little lemon, and added some red pepper flakes.
2460 2018-03-12 18:50:06 I used the Clinique moisture surge with the NYX drop foundation mixed in as a foundation, it really helped with the dry patches when i was on roaccutane. I used a facial oil most nights too!

2476 2018-03-12 18:47:59 Shit bout to get real. So for those of you who don’t know, the dollar is 92% less than what it was initially worth. One of the main reason why the dollar has yet to crash is because countries are still force to buy oil in USD. That is until China finish pushing its issue
2477 2018-03-12 18:47:56 Mercy and profits are like oil and water. . .
2478 2018-03-12 18:47:53 Darkness had fallen all around us, even the dim glow of torches and oil lamps not enough to chase away the dread and fear. #amwriting #MuseMon
2479 2018-03-12 18:47:44 Please also investigate why Sasol who makes petrol from coal mined here in South Africa charges us the same price as refineries who make petrol from crude oil bought in dollars.  Is this not daylight robbery?
2480 2018-03-12 18:47:37 He wants to keep the oil and gas industry going because it's the only thing keeping he and Russia's economy alive, and it helps if the US, as a big consumer, avoids going green. But he benefits enormously from the post-WWII and post-Soviet stability.

2488 2018-03-12 18:46:32 Is it an automatic? If you put it in reverse does it get worse? if so you have probably dirty transmission oil or the pump is on its way out.
2489 2018-03-12 18:46:31 I’ve been waiting to get my oil changed for a hour and a half now 
2490 2018-03-12 18:46:29 it’s been four hours since i dropped my car off to get an oil change & they still haven’t called me.... wtf

2493 2018-03-12 18:45:26 I successfully when to the dmv, took Calli to the vet, paid my taxes and got a new registration, got an oil change and inspection, when to the post office and cleaned my whole house and it isn’t even 3 yet
2494 2018-03-12 18:45:21 Yea so if oil prices hadnt dulled, the economy/gdp/fis deficit would be in even worse shape no. Oil price drop wasnt planned. Hence windfall
2495 2018-03-12 18:45:19 If you don’t put some type of lotion or oil on when you get out the shower.  Can I even trust you ?
2496 2018-03-12 18:45:00 I'm with you! Eating my tomato/mozzarella olive oil snack at work, I spilled the oil on myself. I went into the bathroom and shoved paper towels in my pants to try and dry off, but I was so uncomfortable. I ended up going home to change, I live 45-60 mins away (traffic).

2516 2018-03-12 18:42:31 So if elected you’re going to travel by foot, sail, or horse-drawn carriage? Sell all those fossil-fuel burning suburbans and no more air travel for you? Glad you’re actually acknowledging climate change but using tax $ to sue Big oil is frivolous at best.

2536 2018-03-12 18:40:45 there's gotta be enough olive oil for the both of us

2546 2018-03-12 18:39:52 They tried to prop up their entire "socialist" public infrastructure on oil exports. That didn't go so well.

What makes you think abstracting the oil into a crypto will result in anything but more starving Venezuelans ?
2547 2018-03-12 18:39:49 Hi, from my bartending days we use to take a couple of tablespoons of a good olive oil, before are huge flipping for shots contest's. Hope it works.
2548 2018-03-12 18:39:44 Scheduled my oil change at 12 so I would have time to go home before work but of course they were behind and it took them 2 and a half hours 
2549 2018-03-12 18:39:44 Bishes be mad as hell when you don't wanna talk to them at Pep Boys. Bish I'm just getting my oil changed I don't wanna talk to you

2554 2018-03-12 18:39:05 I've yet to see where the oil companies forced anyone to use their product? So who is to blame for the make believe global warming, or is it climate change this week?

2565 2018-03-12 18:38:07 Yea i know and I'm working on some oil painting, it's just something fast 
2566 2018-03-12 18:37:57 I really spilled an entire bottle of olive oil just now. I was frustrated but I moved quick to clean it up. I can’t help but think of KXL & DAPL and the lack of urgency corps/politicians responsible have to clean these spills on indigenous lands. Except it’s crude oil not EVOO.
2567 2018-03-12 18:37:46 John why Trump does not Defend the #US Oil Company Guys from the Threat of Oil Abroad? Why NOT a #Tariff on imported OIL? Was not OIL a National Security too? ship/tanks do not move without it! #Theday #republiqueLCI #Ajstream @infowars @RedactedTonight @smerconish @maddow
2568 2018-03-12 18:37:23 looks like you answered your own question!  gl gl! ADD OIL
2569 2018-03-12 18:37:20 I now use a non-stick wok for my daily cooking. The key is not just the wok but the heat;you must heat any wok for at least 5 minutes before putting any oil. It is the heat that gives stir-fried food its grilled & smoky flavour that's the hallmark of a perfect stir-fry! KH
2570 2018-03-12 18:37:09 hittin on this oil refinery

2572 2018-03-12 18:36:58 Theres alot of female “car enthusiasts “ nowadays yet they havent laid a hand on their own car they have shops do it, please dont call yourself an enthusiast if you cant even do simple shit like change your own oil, adjust your own coils or put on bolt on parts..
2573 2018-03-12 18:36:58 I actually don't wash mine, but toast it in a bit of oil before adding liquid.
2574 2018-03-12 18:36:55 It is time to raise taxes on the oil corporations that are now going to drill in the Arctic they don’t get our resources for nothing and we taxpayers are tired of paying their corporate welfare
2575 2018-03-12 18:36:50 I love how peppermint oil makes my scalp tingle lmaoo. Feels so good
2576 2018-03-12 18:36:47 Maybe  #USA plan is to send the Kurds of Afrin to populate the east side of the Euphrates where the oil and Iran are.
2577 2018-03-12 18:36:40 My go to is halved, drizzled in olive oil & spices, then roasted in the oven.
2578 2018-03-12 18:36:25 Oil the plants 
2579 2018-03-12 18:36:14 Ultrabland from lush is amazing! You only need the tiniest bit so a big pot lasts me 4-6 months, it feels strange to put so much moisture on your face when you first start using it (like all the oil recommendations) but once you’re use to it it’s effective + gentle on your eyes
2580 2018-03-12 18:36:12 Valor is my favorite essential oil

2583 2018-03-12 18:35:39 Have you tried breathing in the smell of peppermint oil?
2584 2018-03-12 18:35:24 Hey dummy. As you want to file a lawsuit against the oil companies will you not be driving or flying anymore?
2585 2018-03-12 18:34:53 They really be thinking they slick at the dealership. Y’all not bout to get me my daddy can do almost everything on my car I just need y’all for diagnostics and my free oil change thanks 
2586 2018-03-12 18:34:34 You know what will happen.  The oil companies will pass around the Chevron lawsuit lawyers, they are warmed up and well versed, and poor Arnie will have to go back to B movies to pay for his "housekeeper".
2587 2018-03-12 18:34:21 Do NOT do it. It clogs your pores. Unless you’re super dry it’s not worth it. I have learned from my coconut oil everything mistakes.. only coconut oil most things
2588 2018-03-12 18:34:15 WTI oil at $61.49/barrel, -$0.54.
2589 2018-03-12 18:34:13 Sadly, anti oil “environmentalists” are not interested in facts or reality.

2595 2018-03-12 18:33:51 When the Oil is running out (or the need for it) what else are they to do for income?
2596 2018-03-12 18:33:48 ????? Why is Elon doing this? @ElonMusk THINK driving Electric should be cheaper than gasoline.....or your ELECTRIC DREAM will fall apart! Big Oil can still kill the electric car! People don't start driving electric for the the PLANET! Only LOHAS!
Most of your customers are not!

2614 2018-03-12 18:32:11 And all the people that aided and abetted the oil companies, will they be included in the law suit? How about the gas station owners, the auto makers, the airlines, the stockholders, they all have know and are guilty to some degree. Will they be charged?

2616 2018-03-12 18:32:00 This was my problem with Oil Ocean, I’d get to the boss or close in Act 2, but then get game over and have to start at Act 1. That’s why I put it aside, don’t have that much time to waste replaying the level lol. Took me one trip through the acts & 1 death on the boss this time.

2618 2018-03-12 18:31:58 The 3 main differences are:It’s the first criptocurrency issued and regulated by a State. It’s backed by mineral resources: oil, gold, gas and diamond, while the other don’t have material support.
It will not be fluctuating, Its price will vary according to the Venezuelan crude.
2619 2018-03-12 18:31:54 So the issue is that Canadian oil is landlocked, meaning it cannot get to any market aside from the USA. Globalists like this for two reasons: 1) the US globalists get our oil at steep discounts (like 40% off); 2) globalists worldwide supply the world oil market, instead of

Olive oil is godlike tho
2623 2018-03-12 18:31:20 The President still lives in a world where coal is the future, tariffs are noble, oil is a god, and paper couriers are better than email.
2624 2018-03-12 18:31:11 Russia denials will continue. I'd like to think that there would be some diplomatic or economic sanction that would be effective. But.....a mishap/rupture of a Russian oil or gas pipeline (with appropriate denials) might send a clearer signal. Just sayin'.
2625 2018-03-12 18:31:08 we should use our oil before using foreign oil....no arguments there....my statements still aren't false...no matter how much bigly tried to side step it...replace pipelines? sure..make them safer and even a lil bigger? sure...new routes...not a necessity
2626 2018-03-12 18:31:04 I advised her to get a job in the oil industry since she “can’t” find work. Since we hit a record world wide oil consumption - the future looks bright in the industry.

2635 2018-03-12 18:30:07 You should try our instant-acne combat serum, very concentrated therefore you should apply it on specific areas on the skin. It has arginine which improves the skins conditions and appearance. Also for home ingredients try aloe Vera, baking soda or coconut oil 
2636 2018-03-12 18:29:56 Just change the oil. Stop asking me about all this extra shit I know nothing about.....

2655 2018-03-12 18:27:54 Yes, I have looked for the undo button on an oil canvas
2656 2018-03-12 18:27:53 We know who the traitor is his name is Barry Sotoro aka Obama, he coup'd the govt of Ukraine with his operatives. Violating international law in doing so. He is a traitor and a war criminal. The EU wants the oil fields and will stop at nothing for their war machine.

We don't fix up the prices. It's the government that does that. If people can afford petrol at 80 Rs/Litre even though the prices for crude oil have drastically reduced they can afford this also.

2661 2018-03-12 18:27:03 How many Canadian human beings died in train explosions shipping oil? 
How many are at risk of dying because rail is so close to houses? 
How much wildlife is at risk of oil spills from rail transporting oil?
Just asking
#cdnpoli
2662 2018-03-12 18:27:02 Chinese ppi spike was just oil really...as for Polish migrants, the Ukrainian influx never stood in the way of wage growth rising to these levels so i woudnt overplay that.
2663 2018-03-12 18:27:01 I think they r too far in bed w tRump, oil money talks louder than truth
2664 2018-03-12 18:26:52 I wish you showed a similar commitment and urgency regarding oil pipelines.
2665 2018-03-12 18:26:49 How much additional fuel oil will they burn in Q3?
2666 2018-03-12 18:26:46 I’m no mindless defender of the industry that I work in, but the comparison of the oil industry to cigarette manufacturers is fraught. The former has served mankind as a valuable source of energy for hundreds of years...

2668 2018-03-12 18:26:34 No, but it's a % - football takeover being a notable source of highlight. Bit like oil companies and banks sponsoring environment and activism initiatives and awards for young people.
2669 2018-03-12 18:26:32 Don’t stop with politicians, MANY oligarchs, tv execs, oil men, financiers, Wall Street execs, bankers, talk show hosts etc that need to be included in the ultimate indictments and incarcerated for complicity in this treasonous chapter in American history.

2677 2018-03-12 18:25:24 You also do understand that Venenzuela had put "all their eggs" in the basket that was the national produccion of oil, so when that price plummeted, the entire country ended up suffering?

That, plus the appropeation of private businesses led the country's economy to shambles
2678 2018-03-12 18:25:24 The usual things with blockchain&xyz. Transparent ledgers, banking without legacy tech, oil backed currencies and ICOs for Iran.
2679 2018-03-12 18:25:04 once again i will refer to saudi oil being shipped across the atlantic to ontario for consumption. PLEASE justify that and continue explaining how we do not need more pipelines.   alberta oil could of fueled the whole east coast

2689 2018-03-12 18:23:45 I like that as a side symbol unless the get the old oil derrick as a side symbol
2690 2018-03-12 18:23:43 yeh? Right on thanks Oil!!
2691 2018-03-12 18:23:38 Is this just a meal story or will beans and oil come along for the ride?
2692 2018-03-12 18:23:34 my idea for keeping oil in Canada is more refineries...we can replace old lines...but we don't need new routes to meet current energy demands
2693 2018-03-12 18:23:14 So assuming Arnold has engaged in the use of fuel for transportation, wouldn’t he be an accomplice to “big oil”?
2694 2018-03-12 18:23:14 I commented on my mom's perfume about how lovely it was, and she gave me a lavender essential oil roll-on, so now I smell like my mom.

2700 2018-03-12 18:22:21 Recipe for perfect steel-cut oats 
1 cup oats
2 cups soy milk
1/2 cup water
~1/2 tsp coconut oil

Pressure cook for 10 minutes. Natural pressure release.
2701 2018-03-12 18:22:19 This. I visited an organic dairy once and sick cows got homeopathic bee venom and some sort of pepper tonic, as well as essential oil based teat dip. That's just cruel to the cows
2702 2018-03-12 18:22:09 Peppermint Oil, rubbed on the neck and forehead. A heated towel wrapped around the head. When I get them, I will place a pillow over my eyes and forehead (not over my whole face-still gotta breath) and apply a little pressure.
2703 2018-03-12 18:22:04 I never sleep in makeup. I wash, tone, moisturize, and do spot treatments. I do masks weekly. I drink water. I exfoliate. I wash my pillow cases. I do everything right and my skin is still shit. If one more perfect skin sally tells me to put coconut oil on my face I’ll lose it.
2704 2018-03-12 18:21:51 Does anyone want to try your first bottle of CBD oil ?
Drop a yes
2705 2018-03-12 18:21:42 Probably at the Oil Company's suggestion - because they make far more money from raising the price of oil than they could possibly lose from a case like this.
2706 2018-03-12 18:21:31 Well, it makes sense, really - you guys have more oil.
2707 2018-03-12 18:21:21 I need to take my car for an oil change and to fix my tire but I’m so comfy in bed 
2708 2018-03-12 18:21:20 Hard to know for sure but most likely exercising some caution in Venezuela. China gave Maduro only 2.2 billion the year before to improve oil production capacity. Ven received about twice that amount in 2014 and 2015.

2712 2018-03-12 18:21:07 bigly though reasonable at some points...keeps just wanting to make it a debate instead of a discussion...wants to keep things polarized..because he can't disprove my original point..im not campaigning against coal or oil...just stating facts about energy consumptions
2713 2018-03-12 18:20:59 it's such a shame this is who Maceo and Julian have to look up to as a father. Don't be surprised when they're just as fucked up as you seeking out wonderbread bag-less olive oil sessions to recapture some male companionship they missed out on from their perennially fired father

2726 2018-03-12 18:19:27 and the big argument is importing oil is only temp because we will all be wiping our asses with owls this time next year.   lets come back to earth blue tell the starship enterprize to beam you down lol

2728 2018-03-12 18:19:18 Yes we do want more tax paid earlier however, it can't come at the cost of the environment. Australia has the second lowest share of government revenue from oil and gas in the world. At what point will the government grow a back bone and take on the gas industry!

2731 2018-03-12 18:18:51 Wtf I'd rather fry my balls in a vat of boiling oil than ever being seen to go with that skank.
2732 2018-03-12 18:18:46 Converting water to heat energy and other matter is not a viable alternative fuel solution to oil. Alcohol is a much better choice.
2733 2018-03-12 18:18:43 have you actually looked at real charts to see how much gas and oil is imported into Canada for consumption when it can be sourced locally? the wheat industry is suffering now because of the volume of oil via rail.

2736 2018-03-12 18:18:25 I don't understand how this gets worse.
It was 2005 I think when you did a talk in Bristol. 
I knew from then on Palm Oil wasn't always good, deforestation etc.
I don't get it, from then it seems it has increased in popularity.. 
Makes me sad.. And a tad mad. ..
2737 2018-03-12 18:18:20 I haven't taken it myself but our vet recommended CBD Oil for my elderly coonhound. It helped his doggie dementia and anxiety, his arthritis pain, and kept him comfortable for the last few months before he passed away peacefully at home.
2738 2018-03-12 18:18:19 Qué innecesario insultar a la ciudadanía japonesa para exponer el gusto por los viajes (y un ejemplo en particular hermoso aunque académico).
2739 2018-03-12 18:18:17 Did dishes, prepped soup and threw in crockpot, skipped shower, did some finances stuff, and made a huuuuuge coffee! Also have oil coming! Hooray! Now just crossing my fingers that they actually show up lol. Next up: errands. Wheeee!

2749 2018-03-12 18:17:31 Or should I say, are welcomed by people who have links with oil & gas, property tycoons who need their billions to provide effective demand for an over-inflated housing market, and others.

2761 2018-03-12 18:16:08 On the other hand, substitution of oil by Natural Gas is highly underestimated. i.e., increase in LNG prod./exports in the last 5 yrs (more to come...) is all for apps. that were formerly oil territory (notable examples: power gen., petrochems feedstock)

2770 2018-03-12 18:15:15 Thanks, that's what I thought. On your question about diesel & tight oil, the problem is that ultra-light oil/condensate lacks the middle distillates required to refine diesel. That's what ChemE experts tell me.

2784 2018-03-12 18:14:05 its of consequence to everyone. What we should definitely is the phrase "'My anointed"'. Whose anointed?   How do we know them? Are these pastorpreneurs with engine oil on their foreheads anointed by The Most High One?

2789 2018-03-12 18:13:31 BOVAS MD is one of the rare honest Nigerians in oil and gas sector. Kudos to Osun government for hosting this woman of substance.
2790 2018-03-12 18:13:30 This administration will not do anything to harm Russia. They owe the Russians too much cash and must pay it back in kind. Russia's main goal was to be the oil deal from the joint venture with EXXON MOBIL. Thankfully, that money is tied up by current sanctions.

2796 2018-03-12 18:12:59 No :D  no garlic. I think it is just chickpeas, chocolate, sugar, and vanilla - Maybe a little water or oil.  @jamieoliver, maybe you could craft this for us & share the recipe!
2797 2018-03-12 18:12:55 Girl you can buy tea tree oil cheaper than they sell it. Don’t buy it from there anymore 
2798 2018-03-12 18:12:52 Forbes said Prime Minister Narendra Modi's "economic experiments" barely affected India's billionaires,none gained more than oil and gas tycoon Mukesh Ambani, by adding a staggering USD 15.3 billion (67 per cent) to his last year's wealth to become one of Asia's top five richest.

2801 2018-03-12 18:12:38 I always opt for the apricot shells. Disgraceful what's all in our personal health care products and the #FDA does nothing about it. I changed toothpaste to Neem and TTree oil. 
2802 2018-03-12 18:12:33 Right, we will need more people in the industry. So there will probably be a shortage of people to work in the oil industry in general. Apologies if I misunderstood your message.
2803 2018-03-12 18:12:32 No worries. If you have lavender oil rub some on your forehead.
2804 2018-03-12 18:12:17 girl use castor oil
2805 2018-03-12 18:11:57 So why are we still drilling for oil,  fracking, and spraying toxic pesticides.. all of which poison our water & soil
2806 2018-03-12 18:11:55 I wanna be on a yacht right now with nothing but food, tanning oil and music
2807 2018-03-12 18:11:53 The quote was that rUK wouldn't pay Scots pension and that was/is correct. Had Yes won then Scotland would have left EU 24th March 2016. Oil production is reducing, newer fields aren't replacing now depleted ones. Big difference between discovery and recovery
2808 2018-03-12 18:11:52 I just bought a cool new record  No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
2809 2018-03-12 18:11:51 My skin is so happy right now!  shoutout to this Vitamin E oil & extensive amount of water I’ve been drinking
2810 2018-03-12 18:11:50 Yeah that’s what I wanted to get originally but I ended up buying their tea tree oil too so hopefully my skin gets all these blessings lol.
2811 2018-03-12 18:11:48 Did you not notice the drawbridge go up some time ago ? That’s why all the building works , they’ve put oil up on the roof with the Great Knight Clegg organising the defences .
2812 2018-03-12 18:11:43 Another productive day at "Casa Hagger". Oil tank filled with 500 litres, wood panelling removed from 2 bedrooms, blinds, curtain poles & plinths removed and some time spent in the garden too whilst @jenny_menorca did the food shop!
2813 2018-03-12 18:11:43 Maybe "brutal" Canada ought to stop selling the U.S. oil, gas, water, power, and lumber!

2815 2018-03-12 18:11:01 เค้าจะมีความคิดแบบไหนก็เรื่องของเค้า
2816 2018-03-12 18:10:39 No problem! I also go buy a cheap thing of tea tree oil and add it into the wash. But I only do it if I’m having a really bad break out which I haven’t had to do in a while
2817 2018-03-12 18:10:34 Traders looking for short term signals are completely missing the big picture. US shale "flooding" the world with oil is as funny as Elon going to mars..
2818 2018-03-12 18:10:32 Is nature not as picturesque
as it was in the days oil paints and charcoal pencils
brushed it's perfect imperfections with precision,

2820 2018-03-12 18:10:29 Their 'privilege' won't allow them to even comprehend what you're saying. It is cultural conditioning that white is good and black is bad. A poor Africa is a narrative that has been pushed for decades. Yet all precious minerals, oil and such come from Africa.
2821 2018-03-12 18:10:26 I’m going right after finish getting my oil change lol
2822 2018-03-12 18:10:26 California is doing a damn fine job of destroying itself already before Trump or any oil company gets involved #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder

Even if they do, history shows that they will probably hire someone as bad and or less qualified than Chia anyways.
2827 2018-03-12 18:09:33 1 hour until "Oil Tot" blesses the Simming community with new content! Looking forward to it!
2828 2018-03-12 18:09:27 Heard that @Schwarzenegger would be filling a lawsuit against the oil companies.
2829 2018-03-12 18:09:13 try tea tree oil, it’s an anti inflammatory and it helps reduce acne n stuff

2831 2018-03-12 18:08:51 So i decided to buy organic coconut oil this weekend instead of regular and I will not be going back to ordinary coconut oil

2835 2018-03-12 18:08:31 Yeah mah peep. 
Very high perf... high performance diesel with 16 wheels and sun flower seed oil bio fuel. 
Honestly. sometimes I am certain only I can laugh at my jokes 
2836 2018-03-12 18:08:21 No dear. You still need more petroleum engineers to explore, develop and produce the needed oil. Let’s also not forget the gas as well.
2837 2018-03-12 18:08:18 this oil dripping down my neck lol

2844 2018-03-12 18:07:17 I apply Hair oil, and massage a bit.
Listens to Flute or sitar music....
 This helps me during severe headache.
2845 2018-03-12 18:07:17 or he just dislikes snake oil salesman
2846 2018-03-12 18:07:12 Sounds like a game plan. Especially with the hike of US oil production which will drag the prices back down. Nofor Vlad. He IS going to be pissed. 

I'm sure the world can live without the World Cup this time around (even if the Red Devils rock). 
2847 2018-03-12 18:07:08 I had a doctor refuse to give me anything because it’s just stress related and I need to calm down.

Tea tree oil was seriously the only thing that kept it under control.

2850 2018-03-12 18:06:51 I'm not convinced Nuln Oil isn't the solution to everything.
2851 2018-03-12 18:06:48 yeap, combined with cocco butter/oil that has it's own medicinal properties it makes one hell of a medicine
2852 2018-03-12 18:06:42 Looks like a retest of the bunghole
2853 2018-03-12 18:06:38 I’ve done 4 hours of school art out of the 5 hours today I hate oil paint
2854 2018-03-12 18:06:30 I was questioning your assertion about Globalists being anti oil. Globalists are corporations like oil companies which have a lot more than  a paltry 6 mill to play around with.
2855 2018-03-12 18:06:30 Toast.  That's what I used it for. With milk free canola oil margarine
2856 2018-03-12 18:06:21 I keep thinking about this "Crude to Chemicals" initiative. I'm guessing the demand for oil will lead us to a staggering shortage of professionals in the future?
2857 2018-03-12 18:06:16 oil them mfs and put a hot towel on em

 Now could you tell Oscar (the maintenance guy that sweeps the floor around you) to put some kitty litter down. You're dripping oil again...
2865 2018-03-12 18:05:42 Not a competitive catfight folks. We’re just wrestling and fighting in oil and panty hose. Super slippy! Possible topless oh my !
2866 2018-03-12 18:05:32 I make a most of my cleaning and personal care products out of necessity. Ableds think this means I have a beautiful medicine cabinet stocked with lotions and potions and it means I just put straight jojoba oil on my skin and shea butter on my lips lol. My energy is too limited.
2867 2018-03-12 18:05:29 Assad denied western scheme for oil pipeline that would harm Russia's economy. West, and Gulf, instigated regime-change operation. All was going well until Russia stepped in. Western MSM propaganda machine ramps up, with WHs, false-flag coverage etc.. RT shows truth. Russophobia.
2868 2018-03-12 18:05:15 I've used essential oil on my wrists before and it calmed down my hives a lot. they're still there but less prominent and itchy
2869 2018-03-12 18:05:10 Same. I wash atleast twice if I had applied oil before.
2870 2018-03-12 18:05:07 Oil bouncy
2871 2018-03-12 18:05:04 How does a country like Iraq repay nations who defended them with a currency set at such a low rate yet it's main resource is oil. Does their currency ever go back up even if by 10's of cents on the dollar?I'M sensing crickets @SebGorka
2872 2018-03-12 18:04:58 Ginger tea

2875 2018-03-12 18:04:52 patiently waiting for my vape to arrive in the mail . now all i need is some CBD oil , and im good
2876 2018-03-12 18:04:48 Because they have already seen the value and richness of our oil.
Do u know we can get more than 100product out of crude oil?
2877 2018-03-12 18:04:17 I used to avoid dealers but they have figured out how to entice you by offering things like free inspection, substantial discounts for pre-paying for oil changes, etc... That not only locks you in to going to a dealer, but even one particular dealer.
2878 2018-03-12 18:04:12 u deserve to be poorest country in the world, when the oil is over, there u go shitty lows. Time s ticking
2879 2018-03-12 18:04:01 No Connor Lamb is what will be good for PA. Your base is leaving in large numbers. The scam is up. Fold up your tent snake oil salesman and leave town.

2906 2018-03-12 18:00:10 We have oil companies in charge of the epa, rich people in charge of housing and food for the poor, russians in charge of the presidency and the military, and dumbasses in charge of education. What could possibly go wrong in America?

2910 2018-03-12 17:59:50 Because it isn't New York...thus it doesn't matter to the media.
2911 2018-03-12 17:59:44 Olive oil - it does a body AND metabolism good!
2912 2018-03-12 17:59:40 What little I saw of this,  highlights really, This was a terrible performance.  As President Fox says, Trump is President of the Electoral College, not the US. What I saw was NOT the POTUS! Rather, an snake oil salesman we used to see in old western. Phoney! Slick!

2915 2018-03-12 17:59:07 For Western governments there are normally three answers to any foreign affairs question Security, food and oil/gas. We have lived through a benign age where the first answer is rarely required. IMO these three questions are always the answer it is just the question which changes
2916 2018-03-12 17:58:58 Guys, crystals are pseudo-science and don't do anything. Bunk science is bunk science. You can't make fun of oils and believe in crystals. Please stop giving snake oil salesmen money.
2917 2018-03-12 17:58:58 that's how I felt until that shit started getting infected and there was an alien growing out of my nose lol (if that happens, use tea tree oil to save yourself!!!)
2918 2018-03-12 17:58:57 So I was not hip @TheBodyShop had a whole Tea Tree Oil Line for my Face and Body. They have a whole sale going on and I found a coupon for the win.
2919 2018-03-12 17:58:49 3 hrs for an oil change  oh well my car needs it already
2920 2018-03-12 17:58:41 Not a tired old line. Pipelines are the safest way to transport oil to tide water, ask Lac Megantic. Preventing access to tide water hurts the price of Canadian Oil which helps pay for Canadian environmental policy and efforts.

2927 2018-03-12 17:57:24 Manipulating the flow of market information in the art world is massively profitable, if Art is the markets gasoline than deception is it's oil
2928 2018-03-12 17:57:24 Where is your proof that Democrats paid them? Lol...You people are easily conned. I have a can of snake oil that cures everything..Wanna buy?
2929 2018-03-12 17:57:23 Tea tree oil, exfoliating, and sun screen (so they don’t get darker)
2930 2018-03-12 17:57:21 Never got that far East. 
NZ holiday doesn't count
Seriously, too many countries where real security level is covered up for oil wealth, corruption and sport!
F1 in Brazil - FIM staff have heavy security, team staff get threatened & robbed.

2932 2018-03-12 17:57:16 It also has more people in poverty. It depends on the resources the individual country has to offer as to how successful redistribution will be. Not rocket science. Look at Venezuela - oil high, life good. Oil cheap, life bad.
2933 2018-03-12 17:57:09 I'm getting into a fight with a person over how small their oil pastel stick is.
2934 2018-03-12 17:56:51 Iraq was started on a false pretense: WMDS.
But it was all for oil/business.
2935 2018-03-12 17:56:34 LIKE i said...the MAJORITY of CONGRESS is BROUGHT AND PAID FOR!!  #NRA, BIG OIL, BIG PHARMA, ETC!!!
2936 2018-03-12 17:56:27 The brand is new- not the concept of a natural facial oil 
2937 2018-03-12 17:56:11 Of course 5 days before I'm supposed to go on vacation and find a foreign husband my skin wanna act up....

*Bathes in coconut oil and eczema creams*
2938 2018-03-12 17:56:09 Every time I ask my dad a question he just sends me a beer emoji  “will you do an oil change for me?“” “can I come over and annoy you w Rosie?” “” 
2939 2018-03-12 17:56:05 Yo - for real. This us the consequence if the Fukushima Radiation oil spill.

I do not give a damn if yu use THC/CBD products. I don even get high from weed. I could go thru a g or 2 a day.

I have the WORST HeartBurn. That is the only reason i smoke.

Weed does NOT get yu high.

2941 2018-03-12 17:55:58 i almost just accidentally put olive oil on my waffles 
2942 2018-03-12 17:55:52 Hello Mary,
 I’m Derek and I think you are very beautiful. Would you consider a Canadian male that loves being active, fun loving, adventurous and kind? I work in the oil industry and am loyal, responsible, hard working and only wants one woman to share my life with.
2943 2018-03-12 17:55:48 Are you trying to give advice on making these protests more effective? How nice! Do you think people will buy Alberta's heavy oil when light sweet crude is cheaper? Why?
2944 2018-03-12 17:55:46 I was having a discussion about this just this weekend.  My pithy summation was that  boomers got Woodstock and the Summer of Love and Xers got oil shocks and herpes.  The party was over; it was a different world.
2945 2018-03-12 17:55:42 Halka halka lagane ke baad bhi yaar. I can't stand it if I find out that there's still some oil left even after washing, so I make sure I wash it perfectly lol.
2946 2018-03-12 17:55:41 Like if you all are studying for exams and staying awake, ie burning the midnight oil.
2947 2018-03-12 17:55:37 Maduro nationalized the oil industry, and now they're bankrupt. He turned Ven into a warzone, like bernie would. The Trump tax cuts will bring in more than they will cost. Look at all the companies from Apple to Exxon who are hiring legal Americans again.
2948 2018-03-12 17:55:34 Rise of poplar stands changes fauna ecology, from bugs to birds to critters to moose. 
And the prairies are a landscape of change. Loss of bison, prairie fire part of story. Household fuel change also important. Coal, wood to fuel oil, nat'l gas.
2949 2018-03-12 17:55:31 Great Moments in literature
2950 2018-03-12 17:55:21 We know the industry funds everything for its benefit. Canola is refined like petroleum and is definitely not a healthy oil to consume.
2951 2018-03-12 17:55:15 SO LAST NIGHT HULK INADVERTENTLY CREATED THE BEST SANDWICH EVER: PULLED CHICKEN LIGHTLY DRESSED IN RICE VINEGAR, OLIVE OIL, BUTTER, SALT,
2952 2018-03-12 17:55:07 Nigeria's take is "What can I take!!" Without doing anything. Companies want to drill in Nigeria, but corruption and apathy rule. That is why all International companies have moved on to BETTER oil regions like Angola and Brasil.
2953 2018-03-12 17:55:03 Did they have a "snake oil salesmen" category?
2954 2018-03-12 17:54:58 I have a jag so I have to get that type of oil
2955 2018-03-12 17:54:22 Let me know what you think of that brand. I had a friend introduce me to the doTerra PastTense roll on oil. I was super skeptical of using anything but Exedrin lol.. I get major migraines and I'm a believer of using that stuff now. It's been a life saver!
2956 2018-03-12 17:54:22 ไม่ได้ยินร้องเพลงนานเลย ยังเพราะเหมือนเดิมนะคะ 
2957 2018-03-12 17:54:13 You're only focusing on energy sector. You've to look at how education itself has been destroyed in India. India produced great intellectuals & scientists who studied just with oil lamp light when the education system was not corrupt. Not anymore.
Hence, outcome: no difference.
2958 2018-03-12 17:54:06 Halka halka oil lagaane ka.
2959 2018-03-12 17:54:06 Does the coconut oil give off a strong coconut taste or is it subtle?
2960 2018-03-12 17:54:06 Or don’t move, pray over your house and anoint it with oil...
2961 2018-03-12 17:53:53 What about Scotland being the only country in the world to find oil and ACTUALLY become poorer... McCrone Report hid the oil so that we would stay blind and tethered to England whilst they drained our seas. 
Even now, look up Unknown Region Oil worth £40 Billion a year ;)
2962 2018-03-12 17:53:49 ปักค่ะ

2968 2018-03-12 17:52:49 Dear, with technology and R&D investment in relation to Crude to chemicals will create new demand on oil in the long term. If this strategy succeed, we will welcome electrical cars

2971 2018-03-12 17:52:37 Destoried the environment. Check             Helped my buddies in big oil.     Check     Scared to talk to people in the communities and/or hold public meetings.   Check.         I need to waste tax payers’ money on first class airplane tickets, because voters do not like me.
2972 2018-03-12 17:52:29 สู้ๆค่าาา
2973 2018-03-12 17:52:25 I actually drove over 1000 miles after getting an oil change and having my fluids topped off at Walmart just to find out I didn’t have any coolant in my car.
They’re good for saying they vacuumed your car and checked wipers too.
2974 2018-03-12 17:52:13 I think the oil companies are getting desperate and are now happy to have almost anybody in their corner. Nutbars included.
2975 2018-03-12 17:51:50 you coulda been an oil exec's mistress and got all the coin.

3000 2018-03-12 17:48:16 Does it get red? If it’s not terribly terrible you should be able to use tea tree oil or tea tree oil shampoos to help it.

If it’s bad, go to the doctor and they’ll get you a shampoo that should only cost like 5 dollars tops

3031 2018-03-12 17:45:32 Then you would understand that carbon emissions from fossil fuels (coal, oil ...) used to produce electricity contribute to climate change. Not heat from computers. That is why smart people would like countries to invest in renewable energy and stupid people resist ;-(

3066 2018-03-12 17:40:31 …ｽﾔｽﾔ
3067 2018-03-12 17:40:31 It appears? Hahahaha! Your media attaches trump and a point out that obama May as well be the same president! The both are big oil and war! I’m trying to educate you Americans into seeing that you parties only differ with their speeches! Their actions are the same!
3068 2018-03-12 17:40:24 plus, it doesn't go through your liver, which means that delta9 doesn't turn into delta11thc which is far more psychoactive so most people won't feel (as) high as they would if the ingest the oil
3069 2018-03-12 17:40:20 Lmao castor oil. Rub it where you want it to grow
3070 2018-03-12 17:40:15 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
3071 2018-03-12 17:40:08 The utility notice is not intended to be a public shaming method. We're sorry if you got that impression – we want to ensure there are no surprises if water service is interrupted due to a missed payment. The hangers are a follow-up, in case you missed previous notifications.

3076 2018-03-12 17:39:43 Why do I always pick the slowest line when I go get an oil change
3077 2018-03-12 17:39:34 You’re using the argument that because we participate in society we ought not to suggest improving it. Why not reduce dependence now? Or, if you wanna get real realistic, why not build a refinery in Alberta? Actual permanent jobs, and revenue for Alberta, not foreign oil.
3078 2018-03-12 17:39:28 Everyday i consume ... Apple cider vinegar shot, biotin , vitamin C & B, Biotin , green tea ginger tea, fish oil pills, 9.5 P.H .Kagen Water. Fuccc im bout to liveee forever lol

works wonders. great before kissing.
3087 2018-03-12 17:38:06 Because there is no difference between your administrations! AGAIN! They both work for the same donors! They are both the parties of war, Wall Street and big oil! I’ve mention this a few time to you! Nothing will improve until the USA gets off this two party system.
3088 2018-03-12 17:38:04 That’s anyone who doesn’t know shit about me, but they think they do.
3089 2018-03-12 17:38:03 Or adding terpene isolates to hemp oil. Hemp has less than Cannabis, your wording makes it sound like there's none.
3090 2018-03-12 17:37:59 Use a little bit of vitamin e oil on your face. It helps a lot. I over wash too

3094 2018-03-12 17:37:24 Can’t find my bergamot oil, this headache is killing me!!
3095 2018-03-12 17:37:03 Take this with a few pounds of salt.  Investment is fleeing this province.  High paying tech jobs in engineering and oil and gas sector are being replaced with low paying service and retail positions. YYC commercial vacancies still extreme.
3096 2018-03-12 17:37:00 Fuck it ban all religions.
Snake oil salesman.
3097 2018-03-12 17:36:59 LMAO!!!!!!!!!!!! I have to smell shilling oil every night before i sleep  
3098 2018-03-12 17:36:56 BC has income from oil and provincial tax so does Sask. other provinces have a more diversified economy Alberta has lacked development and diversification but we are moving forward now. The world and Canada buy and use our oil and import oil
3099 2018-03-12 17:36:47 at least i got my fingers tattooed, so i had to buy a bottle of this emu oil.
3100 2018-03-12 17:36:47 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, You have to do something about gas and oil prices! It's killing middle American and are farmers. PLEASE
3101 2018-03-12 17:36:45 Always break to get the fiber ends off.  Toss with olive oil, salt & pepper and roasted @ 350 for 15 min or so, to fancy it up wrap in prosciutto and roast same, or you can lightly saute in olive oil or butter with salt & pepper.  It's a Summer favorite.  Also good pickled.  :-)

lumpia: cylindrical
3105 2018-03-12 17:36:18 So Arnold wants to sue big oil for causing global warming he thinks kills people. Maybe they should sue him for movies that glorify gun violence or that kill people who sit around watching his movies instead of exercising.
3106 2018-03-12 17:35:52 Well UN have double standards.cry human rights for drug lords being killed while innocent people in the middle east are being bombed in the hundreds of thousands now.and it's all because of oil.

3110 2018-03-12 17:35:36 Honest question: Is the U.S presence in Syria legal? The Syrian government didn't invite us and other justification seems shaky as well, so why draw the line at oil production?
3111 2018-03-12 17:35:08 I'd buy when oil prices are down. Also the Thanksgiving - Christmas period is usually cheapest time to travel.
3112 2018-03-12 17:35:06 I absolutely love the superfood facial oil!!
3113 2018-03-12 17:34:52 I took a fish oil pill and I can taste it every time I burp. It’s so gross
3114 2018-03-12 17:34:51 not ashy, just left over nail particles.  the nail file does that to when they mess with your cuticles, usually they put on cuticle oil & you wash it off after they use the electric file & they have lotions to soften the skin after your nail polish is dry.  she must not care lmao
3115 2018-03-12 17:34:40 If data is the new oil, why aren’t more people thinking in a considered way about its extraction, refinement, transportation and sale? #sxsw
3116 2018-03-12 17:34:32 I got a lot done today... next is my oil change

3120 2018-03-12 17:34:00 True but everytime Nutley shoots her mouth off or makes a threat she drives people into the anti camp. I wonder what would happen if they did cut off the oil.  Would BC shut down the Port?
3121 2018-03-12 17:33:50 I’m so tired of seeing essential oil posts everywhere
3122 2018-03-12 17:33:49 Use castor oil
3123 2018-03-12 17:33:48 The ISIS oil exports of Syrian oil stopped only when Russia broadcast surveillance video of the exports & bombed thousands of tankers that ISIS was using.   Only then.

3127 2018-03-12 17:33:19 Turn the unit on to speed 10 and let the unit run for 2 minutes.Then turn off the mixer and wipe any excess oil from around the planetary action.  If the mixer isn’t used on a weekly basis, run the mixer at least once a week to keep the grease and oil incorporated together. (2/3)
3128 2018-03-12 17:33:00 We are sorry to hear that! It is normal over time, if not used on a regular basis that some oil can settle and separate causing it to leak out. Unless the mixer has lost a fairly large amount of oil (¼ cup or more) this is most likely not a concern. (1/3)
3129 2018-03-12 17:32:43 Do they cum grease or oil?

3132 2018-03-12 17:32:37 Haha holy crap I just took a close up gander at the ingredients and.. that is the first time I have seen actual corn oil in a cream of any kind. I'm sure you aren't also allergic to corn but I would likely have had actual anaphylaxis from that.  Sheeeesh.
3133 2018-03-12 17:32:31 Tory hypocrisy knows no bounds, I'll bet (judging by his eyes in a photo i saw of him holding cannabis) they're bonging it up every night. It was banned to end the hemp industry and led directly to an oil poisoned world. #cannabis , humans oldest known cultivated plant
3134 2018-03-12 17:32:29 Palm oil is found in so many food items!  It is so hard to avoid.  I hate that they are doing this to the orangutans, other animals and the environment!

3146 2018-03-12 17:30:45 Have one on our Hobart welder generator and I know we definitely put a lot more hours on then you think and that doesn't get run near as much as our chute motor makes you think about changing oil alot more

Until I see you waving from behind a couple of oxen a$$es in a buckboard wagon, you shouldn't lecture ANYONE about what we should/should not be allowed to have/do.

Hypocrite leftists.

3154 2018-03-12 17:30:19 The fact is that demand is growing each year and in order to eliminate oil, we need alternatives. Yet these alternatives require oil for R&D. Again I ask, if we need oil to live, then what's your solution to transportation?
3155 2018-03-12 17:30:15 Oil Prices dropped on expectations that U.S. output will continue to rise this year

3167 2018-03-12 17:28:45 More work has been done in Alberta since 2015 than in the past 10 years. Oil is working on refining the oil so it is cleaner. Over 100 products use oil. Originally I thought BC imported their oil from US but they use our oil.

3186 2018-03-12 17:25:33 I question his sanity. So oil companies are responsible for global warming if so then they are also responsible for electricity freezers AC communication  devices. Saving millions of lives through oil based products.  Maybe we should do a cost reward analysis before we blame
3187 2018-03-12 17:25:32 We eat too much sugar and we eat too many grains and we consume too much vegetable oil.
3188 2018-03-12 17:25:28 We will never allow further off shore oil drilling along our precious coast.

3208 2018-03-12 17:23:54 i was about to have a sexy dream but the girl tasted like rusty metal and fish oil i woke up thought gonna puke
3209 2018-03-12 17:23:42 Let's all pray that homegirl doesn't get re-routed today because I NEED to get my oil changed before my car explodes
3210 2018-03-12 17:23:35 Oh nevermind I though he was an oil baron
3211 2018-03-12 17:23:29 I am with the party the supports lower taxes, oil and gas from Canada and a stronger productive economy and proven track record on trade deals! But tbh @JustinTrudeau has been the worst PM in a long time!
3212 2018-03-12 17:23:28 credit cards are the definition of what is wrong with the world. greed wrapped into a piece of plastic. #oil #money #corruption #whatmoney
3213 2018-03-12 17:23:27 @albertaNDP instead of focusing the battle of Alta. and BC over the TMP,let's inform Canadians the revenue the Fed. Gov't. receives from Alta. oil and make Trudeau get off his butt and get TMP built, This is good for Canada, not just Alberta.
3214 2018-03-12 17:23:18 Don't worry. .....after trump has some oil rigs built the lobster industry will go the way of the whaling industry !
3215 2018-03-12 17:23:05 @kevincalvey What is your reasoning for voting against Step Up Oklahoma?  I'm sure your kids attend private school so you don't give a damn about public schools right?  Enjoy your kickbacks from big oil.

3217 2018-03-12 17:22:36 When r u meeting with the oil industry workers?
3218 2018-03-12 17:22:26 THATS  Exactly what Trump is doing! Creating jobs while destroying the environment! Frack should be against the law! Obama put fracking on steroids and Trump is picking up where obama left off! WE ARE TRADING DRINKING WATER FOR OIL! What could possibly go wrong?
3219 2018-03-12 17:22:09 Website says soy and vegetable wax. Uh, soy is a veggie so IDK what she means by vegetable wax. Palm oil, maybe? My guess is she is blending soy wax with a cheaper wax to save even more money.
3220 2018-03-12 17:22:01 A tablespoon of olive oil is worth more Weight Watchers points than most Girl Scout cookies! I'll be crumbling Thin Mints on my salads from now on.
3221 2018-03-12 17:21:59 I want my entire life to smell like hawaiian tropic tanning oil

3224 2018-03-12 17:21:22 You worked hard on this story Mr. Lipton.  And it shows.  Thank you, and now you are more of an expert on Oil and Gas in the Gulf than anyone in this administration. 
Excellent article.
3225 2018-03-12 17:21:19 Drink oil!.
3226 2018-03-12 17:21:10 Yes babe and the pep Magnolia tissue oil

3234 2018-03-12 17:20:24 While cooking last night.

3235 2018-03-12 17:20:20 @ForrestBennett Explain to me your rationale for voting against Step Up Oklahoma.  I'm sure you have a good reason, like, the oil money in my pocket was too much to turn down etc.  Please enlighten me.
3236 2018-03-12 17:20:12 I alternate between products but here's some of em: the mask of magnaminty from lush (maybe once or twice a week), then witch hazel + mario badescu rose water as toner, and then I moisturize with Jason Vitamin E oil
3237 2018-03-12 17:20:11 Yeah oil...

3241 2018-03-12 17:20:01 Mostly due to BIG OIL lobbyists and THE CORRUPTION in the #GOP, and the ENTIRE trump REGIME!!
3242 2018-03-12 17:19:58 But consider oil instead
3243 2018-03-12 17:19:49 In order to that we need to be able sell our oil to other countries, in order for that to happen we need pipelines to get our oil to tide water. In order for that we need rational, reasonable people on all sides to make sure this happens. Don’t hold your breath!!
3244 2018-03-12 17:19:41 US "owns" Syrian oil the same way Iranian students "owned" 52 US hostages 1979-1981.
3245 2018-03-12 17:19:31 The idiots who propped it up only because "OMG the dollar dropped!" or "stocks are up so buy oil NOW!" are the ones who deserve to feel the pain the most. At least we go long for the correct reasons (fractals). Those idiots on the other hand........
3246 2018-03-12 17:19:30 Really fancy plantain but going shop is far. I also only have olive oil or that 1cal oil

3250 2018-03-12 17:19:01 It’s ALWAYS coconut oil season lol
3251 2018-03-12 17:18:55 @MickeyDollens So why are you against paying teachers more?  Do you hate education and love the money you receive from oil?  I'm sure your explanation will be so enlightening.
3252 2018-03-12 17:18:48 there's only so many days you can keep putting dry shampoo in your hair until the powder just starts soaking into your oil... that's where i'm at.  #ihatewashingmyhair #lifeofahairstylist
3253 2018-03-12 17:18:43 $PQEFF interesting tech. Still a penny though. Have to do more digging. If they can pull out oil sands for $22 a barrel, that's impressive.
3254 2018-03-12 17:18:39 Vaseline has the ingredient that drys it out to make you keep applying. Use s natural moisturizer like olive oil, Rose hip oil or something similar
3255 2018-03-12 17:18:33 Synthetic also lasts 3 times longer in oil change these reductions are being greatly overlooked isn’t one of the keys to lowering our footprint is looking at reductions in a responsible  manner?
3256 2018-03-12 17:18:24 Point taken but in rural Ontario we don't have natural gas pipes at the street. So we have to use hydro, propane, oil or wood. And the 'delivery charge' is the real killer. Often twice as much as the electricity proper. Effective rate at my place is about 30+ cents per KWh.
3257 2018-03-12 17:18:22 3wm oil painting finished
3258 2018-03-12 17:18:15 OMG! The policies of trumps are no different! My point is! EVEN YOUR “GREEN” leader was in the pocket of BIG OIL! There’s not a good guy here! This is the problem with you Americans! You ALWAY point across the isle when your two war parties both do the same exact thing!

3262 2018-03-12 17:17:50 Aww hope you're better soon. I've spent the day #WorkingFromHome waiting for an oil delivery. I watched To Kill A Mockingbird this afternoon skiving a bit! Wonderful film
3263 2018-03-12 17:17:34 Like banking ones which helped stop the worst financial crisis in history? Or those drilling ones after the worst oil spill in history?

Just say what you mean without hiding it!

BTW... how's that process of bringing Ivanka brand jobs back to US going?
3264 2018-03-12 17:17:27 We sell oil in Canada?  I thought that was phased out.

3266 2018-03-12 17:17:19 @ShaneStone89 Explain to me your reason for voting against teacher raises.  Are you paid off by big oil? What is your problem?  I'm sure you have a GREAT explanation.

3281 2018-03-12 17:15:33 Yeah, int'l law? Ever heard of it? The NATO is a bunch of thugs altogether. Turkey buying IS oil & sending in FSA jihadis, US giving weapons to IS/FSA but without US backing for Kurds/SDF, there'd be no #OliveBranch. So direct your anger towards Washington, child!
3282 2018-03-12 17:15:28 It likely shows how much oil Ferrari have been feeding back into the inlet manifold on previous years to try to keep up with the Merc engine. That oil has to go somewhere unless they completely redesign the engine.

3310 2018-03-12 17:11:38 Oil & Gas is Canada’s largest export.

Today, an important grade of Canadian oil (#WCS), is selling for $25.50 USD less than the main North American benchmark (WTI) at $61.65 USD

Canadian natural gas (#AECO) is selling for $0.98 CAD, vs. US natural gas (NYMEX) at $2.78 USD
3311 2018-03-12 17:11:34 Too bad there was no Oil Change or 30 for 30 around when they made the Reinhart trade. The machinations  that went behind that trade would explain a lot.

3318 2018-03-12 17:11:01 It's a great report. Rather than focus on palm oil exclusively for it's agri emissions, it's good to see complete comparisons.
3319 2018-03-12 17:10:57 It's going to be fun watching them push those around when the oil runs out and their whole economy collapses.

3337 2018-03-12 17:08:54 Then you will have no objection to the old worn out pipelines being replaced and the move away from coal, refining oil before it is shipped going ahead. We too have the long term goal of moving away from an oil based economy but it takes time and money.

Who funded the cost?  Get real you protesters you are only doing the work for the benefit of big US oil.

3509 2018-03-12 16:49:24 I don't really disagree with your point that we share the blame (and, full disclosure, my dad worked for oil companies when I was a kid, so I benefited more than most).
3510 2018-03-12 16:49:12 This administration is pushing a new five-year offshore plan that would allow drill rigs to put virtually every inch of our nation’s coastline at risk of devastating oil spills. It’s unconscionable, and it must be stopped.
3511 2018-03-12 16:49:05 @earthguardianz and @Schwarzenegger ? Big oil may be in trouble. Welcome news.

3543 2018-03-12 16:45:38 That’s the worst. It’s happened all my life to me. The last one I remember was in Nov of 2016, during a DGD set. I slipped on fucking oil from a fog machine, and I was crying for help in a dark backstage area no one was at. I had to crawl back to everyone. Hahhahaha

3551 2018-03-12 16:44:57 You’re a brave man! What’s your view? That we break higher than 2800 before or after some weak knees from the bulls? I don’t like that oil down, HY down, VIX up...it doesn’t add up. We *could* (to use Musk language) retest the lows still, in my view.

3563 2018-03-12 16:43:05 Either oil prices need to rise to make their loan repayments and importing enough goods possible or the debts need to be forgiven. Unfortunately for them, neither will happen and new leadership won't make that happen either.
3564 2018-03-12 16:43:00 Ok so global trade in oil using the dollar must also stop, 72 years of that monopoly is enough, we all now want a share of that pie.

3576 2018-03-12 16:41:50 Clearly, anyone who received a paycheck or dividend from an oil company *in addition* to cheap stuff benefited more than those who didn't -- and the bigger the check the greater the benefit. Not sure what "data" is needed to support that.
3577 2018-03-12 16:41:47 Uminom nako ng Gamot, uminom nako ng Gatorade naglagay nako ng Pain killer at Menthol na oil! Jusko di effective!  naglabas nadin ako ng sama ng loob sa cr hanggang ngayon masakit padin! 
3578 2018-03-12 16:41:20 “Data is the new oil”. Easily quotable, but this statement has many flaws - for one oil is finite, data isn’t. @shawnpowers #EUatSXSW #SXSW

3603 2018-03-12 16:39:08 It is not for the sake of Syrian people that you are taking us into war, it’s for oil. There are 6 million people starving and dying in Yemen. Do you have the same concern for them?  #Syria

National Defense requires 10% of all Aluminum Production . Steel industry won't make pipe for oil Production
3606 2018-03-12 16:38:52 Hate waiting to get my oil changed
3607 2018-03-12 16:38:50 Do more research, how did this increase come about? It is majorly because of increase in oil price which is outside @MBuhari Control. The same way you won't blame him for decrease in price, The point now is what has he done with the increase in external reserve.
3608 2018-03-12 16:38:27 Just another hypocrite on the lefty train.
3609 2018-03-12 16:38:16 Oh no I put too much oil in my salad

3613 2018-03-12 16:37:46 Have you tried coconut oil?
3614 2018-03-12 16:37:42 モブおじさんが何故雨生龍之介に概念バトルで勝てないかってそりゃあ、モブおじはあくまでも「モブ」であり、龍之介がいる“世界の死角”に潜む存在だからだ。龍之介は普段人がうっかり足を踏み入れた瞬間を狩るけど、モブおじも活動範囲がそこなので龍之介の宝具(？)効果圏内に入っちゃうんだよね
3615 2018-03-12 16:37:39 I’m old enough to remember when SXSW was just about music and entertainment.
3616 2018-03-12 16:37:25 Hi from across the pond! Yes we're quite busy here at the moment with the oil spill, thanks for sending this over. Hope all is well on your side :)

Knowledge, data & science is the New Oil.
3621 2018-03-12 16:36:54 I'm trying my best to practice vegetarianism but it's super hard for me as a college student and plus most of my campus non-meat meals are drenched in oil. Wonder if you could give some advice or tips?
3622 2018-03-12 16:36:54 #beautytips: For #liquidlipstick removal coconut oil seems exotic & luxurious but it's composition is a type that lays on top. Petroleum jelly breaks them down easier and leaves lips softer. I can do endless lip swatches with no irritation.
3623 2018-03-12 16:36:53 He wants the oil for his buds back home, just like the opium in Afghanistan. There is always money when we meddle over there
3624 2018-03-12 16:36:51 You mean Conan, The Barbarian?
3625 2018-03-12 16:36:41 Ngeliat video acara musik yg bernomor itu ngakak2 sendiri karena ada om2 berotot joget pake baby oil
3626 2018-03-12 16:36:15 I wonder how much guys get paid to  lie via tweet and say a few drops of oil, grew them a full beard...

You're liking the beard oil aye? 
3632 2018-03-12 16:35:27 Mcm mana nak tau ada mineral oil eh? Apa nama ingredients tu? Sbb baca tulisan kat bottle tu it says 'oil free'
3633 2018-03-12 16:35:27 This lady is a snake oil salesman that's trying to dumb down our education systems with privatization and laissez faire thinking in order to turn it into yet one more 'profit center' for investors.

3636 2018-03-12 16:34:49 Dang. I’m at a Oil and Gas conference at the Hyatt Regency. Wish I would have known
3637 2018-03-12 16:34:35 At least I clued-in I forgot my wallet b4 I drove over the bridge & got too far. Gave me a chance to put product in my hair, cuz the baby strands were out of control. I use #ORSlove Olive Oil Smooth-n-Hold Pudding. My hair still feels soft and pliable but those stick-outs r gone!
3638 2018-03-12 16:34:20 First lesson nothing is free be careful of snake oil salesmen
3639 2018-03-12 16:34:19 "Oil be back" Mr Terminator
3640 2018-03-12 16:34:04 So it means to be perky?
3641 2018-03-12 16:33:54 where is the beard oil on the site? 
3642 2018-03-12 16:33:39 Had no idea you were also an essential oil lover
3643 2018-03-12 16:33:36 Oats with a dash of sesame oil and sriracha sauce. Yum!
3644 2018-03-12 16:33:33 Healthy chilli: Heat vegetable oil in a large pot, add in 1 chopped onion and cook until translucent. Add in 2 chopped bell peppers, 1 chopped jalapeño and some garlic (or garlic powder) and cook until soft (~2mins). Add 1 tsp cumin, oregano, salt, 1/2 tsp black pepper (1/2)
3645 2018-03-12 16:33:29 @SpunkLube and coconut oil 
3646 2018-03-12 16:33:29 $34 for a 3.5oz candle?  Is it made from truffle oil?  Saffron dust?  Ghandi's ear wax?  WTF.

3648 2018-03-12 16:33:08 My skin is too oily to use coconut oil on it 
3649 2018-03-12 16:33:07 Not to mention, the US has a ton of oil reserves, way more per capita value than Norway’s. An oil-subsidized system would work even better here than it does there.
3650 2018-03-12 16:32:44 Pisces: Today you will discover a reservoir of crude oil. How all your blood was replaced with it or how you're still alive is a mystery.

3652 2018-03-12 16:32:34 Question: US exports seem to be capped at 1.4 million bar. /days while current capacity is 2 million!  Why extending capacity if there are no customer foe shale oil (API high level,  quality...)?
3653 2018-03-12 16:32:29 What's your thoughts on OPEC? Dose Canada and Canadians not benefit when they stabilize the price of oil?
3654 2018-03-12 16:32:25 I had literally just got new tires, oil changed and filled up my gas tank just for some dumbass to hit tf outta my car ugh I hate my life rn

3656 2018-03-12 16:32:13 Instead of the crown corporation ( masons) giving licenses to BP & royal Dutch Shell to rig and drill for oil ( as they are the shareholders ;) ) the snp and labour should be sending in their own rigs for the state.
3657 2018-03-12 16:31:57 Yea the battery only cost like 30 & the oil cost 40
3658 2018-03-12 16:31:53 अबे तुम झूठ फैलाने वाले कीड़े हो,

3659 2018-03-12 16:31:45 We had a great time volunteering at Lucas Oil on Saturday for the State Robotics Competition.
3660 2018-03-12 16:31:40 Ugly ? Why, because he’s black? Warner and Smith are no oil paintings....
3661 2018-03-12 16:31:37 Oil Sacrifole Feather
3662 2018-03-12 16:31:31 Getting an oil change can be so time consuming but it’s worth it in the end
3663 2018-03-12 16:31:25 @18002096006 Ms Dewan four-wheel Rewari (Haryana ) , What a treatment to customer again . Did nothing but the oil replacement ...And bill of more than 10K ... Every service there is same mismanagement
3664 2018-03-12 16:31:25 So I’m out here trying to get my oil change done and my car is soooo dirty  it’s embarrassing 
3665 2018-03-12 16:31:11 I'm no fan of big oil, but may Rex Tillerson would have done a better job...;)
3666 2018-03-12 16:31:07 mineral oil ni dengan perfume ni depends on skin ..mineral oil tend to clog pore. if sensitif better avoid . kalau tak jadi apa apa boleh je continue pakai
3667 2018-03-12 16:30:59 OIL DIFF: 3.72 -> 3.72
3668 2018-03-12 16:30:56 Exactly.  This is like what would've happened if AT&T pre-breakup was run by Mao.  I would say this one of the most dangerous examples of a monopoly since Standard Oil.
3669 2018-03-12 16:30:51 I understand but you’re giving the impression that his ‘film from the audience’ is somehow sub standard when he just means he’s doing a Jurassic Park after doing a Schindler’s List. He’s not a snake oil salesman like JJ Abrams etc
3670 2018-03-12 16:30:49 So US tax reform passed, but now push for stealth tax by pushing price oil up - who does it hit worse? middle class and lower income... #stealthtax #gastaxincrease #http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/377681-trumps-infrastructure-push-hits-wall-in-congress?userid=155113

3674 2018-03-12 16:30:25 Maybe get someone to do it for you? I wouldn't offer the advice unasked except that it really works. My current old car is a 1996 Nissan pickup. It has good compression, &doesn't burn oil, but it really needed new vac hoses. I replaced them &the change for better was amazing.
3675 2018-03-12 16:30:10 OIL DIFF: 3.62 -> 3.74
3676 2018-03-12 16:30:06 ええ！もっぱら港で散見されたようですのでお楽しみに！！(゜∀。)
3677 2018-03-12 16:30:05 I doubt they knew who Betsy DeVos is.
3678 2018-03-12 16:30:05 When will you stand up for Canadas oil and gas sector?
3679 2018-03-12 16:29:33 Just thought of this - how long until Arnie tries to revive his box office mojo by making an updated On Deadly Ground, basically Commando against those "murdering" oil execs?
3680 2018-03-12 16:29:15 This legislation also opens doors more scritiny for previously signed deals including SOMA OIL & GAS agreement. The opposition MPs are going to cash in this opportunity..
3681 2018-03-12 16:29:15 Thanks for raising awareness of sustainable palm oil.

3685 2018-03-12 16:28:19 私は元々夢女だけど、残念ながら「好き」になってほしいわけじゃなくて、かといって無視されたい訳でもなく、理想はやはり怖がられたい怯えられたいってあたりだからモブおじさんになるしかねぇ……(変！身！)
3686 2018-03-12 16:28:17 Why don’t you personally say the same thing about Canada’s oil and gas industry?
3687 2018-03-12 16:28:01 みんな自分なりの美学なるものがあるから衝突はするけど 辞書でも出てくる通り 「美しさに関する独特の考え方や趣味。」という意味だしそもそも独特だから ある程度許し合いながら にこにこしていたいなぁ。
3688 2018-03-12 16:27:51 Lmao. Black soap and coconut oil, plenty water and minding my own business.

3691 2018-03-12 16:27:26 getting my bf some @BahiCosmetics beard oil hopefully he gets what he’s always wanted !
3692 2018-03-12 16:27:25 Saut shrimp & veggies in 1tbsp of coconut oil & serve over brown rice spaghetti. Delicious & easy 2 make in bulk.
3693 2018-03-12 16:27:24 Without oil he would not be able to jet set around the world, drive his fuel inefficient vehicles, lubricate the weapons he has or uses in his adventure films. He should be sued for contributing to the nonexistent global warming hoax. Throw Al Gore in there too.
3694 2018-03-12 16:27:23 Here's my 2 cents worth.  The transmission is goofy. Have a road gear reverse that don't match up to the forward range. So shifting sucks. If you let it roll down a silage pile with your foot on the clutch the transmission starves for oil.
3695 2018-03-12 16:26:05 バーサーカーは最強ですからね……！！(？？)
3696 2018-03-12 16:26:02 救援感謝　ねよう
3697 2018-03-12 16:26:00 You’ve got pre-1990s Norway. heavily socialist. Also Finland and Sweden don’t have oil and they are still comparably socialist.
3698 2018-03-12 16:25:59 I will apply the oil and body spray as professional as possible
3699 2018-03-12 16:25:44 To be semantically correct, pushing something "like snake oil" is not the same as identifying something as snake oil.  One could make the argument that ignoring a burgeoning altcoin market is 'like' pushing snake oil.
3700 2018-03-12 16:25:33 The Trump administration's plan to broadly expand drilling in U.S. offshore waters is moving slowly due to opposition from coastal states and indifference from oil companies that have turned their focus to other opportunities.
3701 2018-03-12 16:25:17 For those of you wondering if I have "big plans" for my birthday, yes. I'm getting an oil change and maybe some new tires because my life is glamorous. #blessed
3702 2018-03-12 16:25:00 "Oh, so it is?"

-He reaches for the doorknob and holds it... before smashing the door down. He holds the now separate doorknob in the air, and pantomimes opening the door with it. He then does so to close the door before dropping the doorknob.-

3710 2018-03-12 16:24:01 So Quebec restricts their syrup production to keep prices high, while competitors then move in to fill demand.  OPEC tried to restrict oil for same reason and now oil is produced everywhere globally.
3711 2018-03-12 16:23:53 Loving this coconut oil
3712 2018-03-12 16:23:50 thank god for hailey bc i only have 10 days to get my tires rotated and my oil changed before spring break and i almost forgot
3713 2018-03-12 16:23:49 Many still desire the genuine anointing yet few want to totally die to self. The more oil you want from the olive the more it must be squeezed, crushed, ground up till at last it nothing but the purity of Christ manifested in and through us.

3717 2018-03-12 16:22:44 Oil companies. Leave California. They don’t want you, won’t treat you right and OBVIOUSlY don’t need the power.
3718 2018-03-12 16:22:27 Will be war between oil and solar energy soon to happen? If true I support green energy rather than pollutes !!! oops in my country still using  oil to engine vehicles

Unicorn dust doesn't power the ambulance ride to the hospital.

3728 2018-03-12 16:21:05 So your premise is that a Light Sweet Oil is replacing a Heavy Sour oil? That in effect they are somehow equal?

Or is Venezuela actually a problem for shale because shale needs heavy crudes to blend with and losing Venezuela could affect shale demand?
3729 2018-03-12 16:21:05 Ya' flog scurvy dogs with it, duh!  *She whips out a lit match, lighting up the oil lantern to the side of the set of bunks.* Got a little side-table drawer here, a couple a' hooks. Not much, but for all intensive purposes, they're yours!
3730 2018-03-12 16:20:55 Yup! Super easy I use a marshmallow base and just fold in the infused oil or butter and they last!

3732 2018-03-12 16:20:20 I love when I get new face stuff :)  always exciting to get a package even if I bought it myself!  I used my new essential oil diffuser yesterday.  Clementine and peppermint kept me feeling very alert all day!
3733 2018-03-12 16:20:20 I shaded these with agrax, nuln oil, and sepia. I'll probably add more shading and layer on highlighting as part of my continued tinkering. Wanna call out more details too, like the backpack strap, pockets, etc.

3742 2018-03-12 16:19:08 Like in the Middle east, crude oil exports will be reduced to feed these refineries and increase product exports. What one hand giveth the other taketh away.

3744 2018-03-12 16:18:56 @realDonaldTrump @RealJamesWoods @ luvsmusic                       Arnold  Schwarzenegger wants to sue the oil companies for global warming? Wouldn't it be something if he were sued because his movies promoted gun violence? His brain has been warming in the sun way too long!
3745 2018-03-12 16:18:36 Consumers did not benefit as much as oil company owners and executives, nor did they actively lobby against measures to account for externalities.
3746 2018-03-12 16:17:57 What an idiot. Oil companies do not kill people but ISIS does.
3747 2018-03-12 16:17:53 Or that "big oil" money....

3765 2018-03-12 16:16:00 I wanted a Tesla someday because:

- I hate the power the oil cartels have over our lives
- I'm half-blind so self-driving cars would be perfect for me

But now I'm considering never purchasing one
3766 2018-03-12 16:15:47 Gas prices are 10% higher than last year.  Meanwhile, gasoline inventories are now higher than last year.  Oil glut is now a gasoline glut? #OOTT
3767 2018-03-12 16:15:47 Oh goody. Let’s tilt at some windmills and drive the price of oil up more so we can’t afford to buy gasoline. #ArnoldQuixote
3768 2018-03-12 16:15:38 His career earnings are earnt hourly in the oil industry. Good luck with that
3769 2018-03-12 16:15:35 Trudeau sure supports Quebec based business, when they face challenges he drops everything and focuses on a resolution. Now compare that to what he has done for oil and gas and other western CDN based businesses

3778 2018-03-12 16:14:38 If he files the lawsuit in CA, big oil is screwed. Activist judges will look at this as an opportunity to redistribute more wealth.
3779 2018-03-12 16:14:28 I also think the products and regimens seem really weird to get your head around at first if you're used to just using creams. I couldn't understand for ages that something like argan oil could be used in place of my night moisturiser - Bit fiddly and oily, but amazing results!
3780 2018-03-12 16:14:27 Ada jugak guna tea tree oil utk kecutkan jerawat.  Parut guna serum cocoa butter

3797 2018-03-12 16:12:31 I love hot wings...but restaurants all use the crap oil to fry them. 

So I make my own: Either bake or fry in lard, hot sauce & melted butter for buffalo sauce.

3800 2018-03-12 16:11:54 Spoken strongly... while meeting with "tar" - sands- anti - oil - Bill Nye. This is no myth
3801 2018-03-12 16:11:33 Cushing is where heavy grades are located.  The shale oil on the coast may not be what the market needs and Cushing must have at least 15 million bar.  to operate.  Coming quarter will be interesting!  Not all bar. are equals...

3804 2018-03-12 16:11:12 So this is probably the oil they WERE burning through the crankcase breather...
3805 2018-03-12 16:11:08 Big $ US doing to us what they did in middle east, south America and anywhere there's oil. They buy the idiots and native chiefs to protest.

3808 2018-03-12 16:10:43 She'll probably side with the oppressors like she has repeatedly done with the EU.  :/ Any OIL in South Africa? Shale? If not, then the farmers are f*cked!

3811 2018-03-12 16:10:15 Which policy?  Where she was #Forgainst gay marriage?  Where she was fighting for fracking the environment and the rights for #DAPL to leak oil everywhere? Where she fought for the rights of all "Superpredators"? Where she fought for transparency using sound machines at rallies?
3812 2018-03-12 16:10:10 I do (more or less regularly) pure oil mask (coconut or olive) +12h before washing and massage it into my scalp. You can’t do any damage with it so do this as long as you want before washing o: if I do it over night I’ll sleep with a towel in my pillow and my hair in a loose bun
3813 2018-03-12 16:10:10 Sounds like she looking for mr real guy who can play the game. Good luck finding oil and water mix!

Highly potential areas include: oil and gas, tourism, agric, education, real estate, aviation, health, telecom , solar etc?
3816 2018-03-12 16:09:09 Btw...the Republicans don’t actually support Trump. You know that right? Please tell me you don’t believe the Republicans actually like that snake oil salesman???
3817 2018-03-12 16:08:54 Ironic that Kotkin mourns loss of Occidental Petroleum when many people in CA probably argue against the dependence on oil and natural gas on a daily basis. A case of #BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor ?
3818 2018-03-12 16:08:53 so we have a whole database full of all the kinds of information we need for cars right? except for our hybrids for some reason. I love googling the owners manual and going thru page after page just to find oil capacity
3819 2018-03-12 16:08:51 @mikaminio Are you sure of figures for North Sea Oil? If 20% can be extracted by next Christmas - you are saying there are only reserves for less than 10 years, yes? I'm wassuming Christmas 2019? Are these for UK sector only or what do they cover?

3825 2018-03-12 16:08:28 GIRL lmao ugh. I made 2 concoctions, one to put in my diffuser and one for my skin, and mixed them up! Smh! Thank god I have literally every carrier oil. The tears are now subsiding. Minty freshness still present, but bearable. 
3826 2018-03-12 16:08:21 Pat the oil off!
3827 2018-03-12 16:08:20 and yeah! Aside from just moisturizing your face bago matulog, isali na rin ang lips using **** oil & ***** jelly (para mukhang naka liptint ka araw-araw) pero wala naman pala! Natural na pula/pink lang pala talaga. DM for this secret! Hahahahaha

3835 2018-03-12 16:07:33 Why don't you charge Carbon tax to exported oil and charge a hefty environmental fee for our drinking water to the US? Don't carbon tax us Canadians. This is something you should consider Mr. PM. Without any disrespect of my comment.
3836 2018-03-12 16:07:32 "But I won't stand up for our oil and gas industries because that's Alberta."
3837 2018-03-12 16:07:25 What kind of oil?
3838 2018-03-12 16:07:21 Shit, we rely on Saudi oil and influence so much, could just say "the Muslims". Conservative populists love saying that!
3839 2018-03-12 16:07:14 Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA and 100% Organic Cold-Pressed Argan Oil.

It's the regimen they recommend for dry skin. I live by the sea, so worry the elements are likely to wreak havoc. But now my skin feels super hydrated.
3840 2018-03-12 16:06:44 Did my first oil change today on my car thanks to my uncle show me how to do it :)
3841 2018-03-12 16:06:29 He has to be joking. Without oil, he can’t travel by plane or car. Plus people needed gas when the hurricane hit to run a generator to keep people running necessities like the fridge, lights, fans, tv to track storm, running water.
3842 2018-03-12 16:06:28 LMAOOO activating the minty freshness.  I’ve been here before. That’s hilarious. Do you have almond oil? Or coconut oil?? Throw in a carrier oil to tone it down.
3843 2018-03-12 16:06:24 He needs some oil for his coat.
3844 2018-03-12 16:06:23 I have to get an oil change, but I r e a l l y don't want to do that
3845 2018-03-12 16:06:22 friend you are deluded! Tar sands dirtiest oil. Nobody wants and it is stopping Canada from meeting our Paris commitments. Go renewables. More jobs=a livable future. #cdnpoli #KeepCanadaWorking
3846 2018-03-12 16:06:11 I want to do that. Guess I'll stop eating butter. I love it, but need to lower LDL. I know it may not make a difference but I think I am sensitive to too much saturated fat (ApoE4 gene). Do you avoid olive oil?
3847 2018-03-12 16:06:11 Aqueos cream with glycerine, olive oil and castor oil
3848 2018-03-12 16:06:09 @realDonaldTrump  Interesting that you think you can set immigration rules, tariffs, net neutrality, oil drilling and mining, safety regulations, and yet, you don't have the gonads to save the children in their own schools.
3849 2018-03-12 16:06:07 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.

3853 2018-03-12 16:05:47 If the new tariffs spark a major trade war, Ohio manufacturing and agricultural exports could be hurt. last year only eight other states exported more goods than Ohio, which exported nearly $51 billion worth of goods, including machinery, vehicles and parts, oil seed & grains.

3858 2018-03-12 16:05:21 After long bouts with anxiety that culminates as hypochondria. I can assure you, one of the many bad aspects of having to beg for your life via a public Facebook pages is people constantly commenting “try cbd and hemp oil”.

3862 2018-03-12 16:05:08 PSA: coconut oil is not good for your hair!!! it just sits and acts as a waxy layer over top, rather than penetrating into the hair
3863 2018-03-12 16:05:06 my hair stylist recommended coconut oil (as is) to treat dry ends o: everything is connected! my hair is actually pretty chill if I condition and don't wash daily (took me a loong time to get away from daily washing). still in testing phase tho, will remember this recommendation!

Great times.
3867 2018-03-12 16:04:33 Gonna attempt to look good when I go get my oil changed to try and get a discount  #brokecollegestudent
3868 2018-03-12 16:04:27 Fact, he sues the oil companies gets paid millions to go away. We get stuck with higher fuel cost to pay for his gain. Democrat! Who else thinks like that, but a democrat!?

You can put crappy oil and gas in the engine, keep the gas tank low and it will run, but it will lag and overall, probably not last as long.....

3912 2018-03-12 16:00:28 I love oils for my dry ass skin! Boutta add avocado oil to the mix. I’m already using rosehip oil, squalane during the day only, the La Mer rejuvenating oil at night only (which is a mix of a bunch of oils), and tea tree oil for spot treatments

3937 2018-03-12 15:58:21 “Maybe if I buy a simple pair of earrings, I’ll finally feel like my life is together” I say after already purchasing a coffee pot, an oil diffuser, a planner, 5 pairs of shoes, several NYT best sellers, a car, a backpack and something called “yoga toes” for the very same reason
3938 2018-03-12 15:58:11 He won't! Notice his followers, very few from District 43! See hashtags #NoVote4Omar #VoteNo4Omar #VoteYes4Duterte #ScrewsInTires  There are also many more videos of him they'll use.  His competitors will definitely use that against him going into the generals!

3952 2018-03-12 15:57:27 Before news was co-opted & fractured into axe-grinding outlets for private interests, people were much better at discerning shills & snake oil salesmen.
3953 2018-03-12 15:57:27 Increase Oil Imports from Iran, despite the ban by USA. . Iran agreed to sell in Indian Rupees and it saved our Forex, not just for now, but protected India from future currency fluctuations. India also gets to build “Chabahar” port of Iran, encircling Pakistan.

3956 2018-03-12 15:57:05 But don’t we need the null results to weigh against the miraculous? Suppose the one olive oil study that finds a result is published. Would be great to have the other 99 null ones as well. Maybe in a journal just for that purpose, but still useful
3957 2018-03-12 15:56:54 Olive oil after the solarium? You need some UVB rays.

3971 2018-03-12 15:54:31 Make sure to take fish oil. It enhances the vitamin d greatly. Been taking it for years
3972 2018-03-12 15:54:28 typical liberal for you sue the company fill your own pocket with cash and let the consumers Payback the oil companies the amount they had to pay to you by raising prices all all types of fuel
3973 2018-03-12 15:54:22 The world’s most valuable resource is no longer oil, but #data! There is a change needed.. the user should own their data and not governed by the big boys. Decentralize the Internet!

3980 2018-03-12 15:53:31 The root of all of this has to do with geopolitical control of Oil and incompetent US politicians colluding with Israel (through foreign agents lobbyist & donors) against their own national interests

3983 2018-03-12 15:53:11 It depends whether they are Hydrogen engine vehicles or not. H Engines burn oil & produce trace metals emissions derived from lubricating oil. Better that you stop chopping down mature trees, thus reducing emmissions from your deisel vehicles. Trees also reduce engine pollutants.
3984 2018-03-12 15:53:02 oil and gas costs far, far more than that, and always has, we just don’t pay it directly (we offload it into the atmosphere)

3989 2018-03-12 15:52:15 You shouldn't let that out. The big oil grinds up up and spit you out.

Oh, they already did that before, so you are used to it?
3990 2018-03-12 15:52:05 He went nutso!
3991 2018-03-12 15:52:00 Wow yes I missed TRP. Back in March 2016 at the start of that big move the Oil price was what.. average $37 per barrel.. I'd imagine the markets are much more liquid now with much greater sentiment / appetite for Oil with the price today around $63
3992 2018-03-12 15:51:49 He all but destroyed the Republican party in California, now he wants to destroy the oil industry.

4003 2018-03-12 15:50:30 Bad example IMO.  Farmer isn't sovereign.  And farmer isn't world's largest creditor.  And farmer isn't world's biggest FX reserve holder.  And farmer doesn't have nuclear weapons.  And farmer isn't world's biggest oil importer.  Other than those things, your example is valid.

4005 2018-03-12 15:50:20 Thank you for being brave enough to step up & sue oil companies. You are right, they along with big tobacco knew exactly what they are doing, Monsato knows to & choses to kill people & planet for the profit of few.

4007 2018-03-12 15:50:01 Maybe get someone to do it for you? I wouldn't offer the advice unasked except that it really works. My current old car is a 1996 Nissan pickup. It has good compression, &doesn't burn oil, but it really needed new vac hoses. I replaced them &the change for better was amazing.

4024 2018-03-12 15:47:30 Here’s how Trump brought Kim to the negotiating table:
No 1.  he dried up Kim’s personal cash - KIM IS BANKRUPT 
No 2.  he dried up North Korea’s cash - N KOREA IS BANKRUPT 
No 3. he cut ALL OIL supplies
No 4.  Trump is starving Kim’s regime 
No 5. He exploited Kim’s inexperience
4025 2018-03-12 15:47:25 Most people denying climate change are not stupid. I just realized they are probably just plain evil. My guess is that most of them have some financial ties to the oil industry.
4026 2018-03-12 15:47:25 I need to use the real gas law in my very many PVT calculations in my reservoir engineering (oil and gas) works. Pressure changes in the 100's of bar and T's in the 400+ degK's

4029 2018-03-12 15:47:00 Such BS. This will be thrown out immediately. "Big oil" only produces what "big customer" demands, approx. 100M barrels DAILY or over 1000 barrels/second !

4038 2018-03-12 15:45:25 This is all very true. I would also like to know what dirty tricks we play. I suspect it’s things like manipulating the crude oil prices to stress the Russian economy
4039 2018-03-12 15:45:02 Or just typical Chinese being their quirky selves! They are actually doing the world a favour by wearing the head pieces. Many of them are ... ahem ... no oil paintings.
4040 2018-03-12 15:45:02 Proverbs 10:22  ¶The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it.

Ezekiel 16:9  Then washed I thee with water; yea, I throughly washed away thy blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil.
4041 2018-03-12 15:44:47 Yes, Nuclear power plants are potential bombs waiting to go off. But so are oil rigs, coal power plants and natural gas plants. We use Nuclear power because it’s output is environmentally friendly, though there are risks. Humans have had half a century to make these safer.
4042 2018-03-12 15:44:45 I will bathe and shower in coconut oil and shea butter if I could 
4043 2018-03-12 15:44:43 If you say “Dee’s Oil” fast what does it sound like?
Diesel.
4044 2018-03-12 15:44:33 Think you going just to get an oil change... man get everything fixed. Paying more than you planned
4045 2018-03-12 15:44:19 I need to call Jeep about my oil change but I owe they asses 77 dollars so I’ll pass 
4046 2018-03-12 15:43:45 Aloe Vera, green tea, and coconut oil are my bffs for lifeeee.
4047 2018-03-12 15:43:28 We are dealing with so much corruption coming from this administration that seems unreal. What is Congress waiting for, to subpoena Future Venture LLC to find out about this illegal oil deal in Venezuela between Don Jr, Gentry Beach and top National Security Council officials?

How to make cannabis infused coconut oil
4052 2018-03-12 15:42:16 Ya, i was buying airlines last week - they are very cheap as an industry and oil is expensive - will provide nice tailwind to industry if oil falls
4053 2018-03-12 15:42:09 What about the oil?
4054 2018-03-12 15:42:06 I love oliver oil
4055 2018-03-12 15:42:04 A mechanical failure or sudden oil spillage doesn't wipe out the computer's algorithms, data, and ability to multitask, ie plan risk contingency + risk 
prevention simultaneously.
4056 2018-03-12 15:42:03 It does if you believe you don't need to have enough oil for your lamp.
4057 2018-03-12 15:41:58 Oh Matt, this is such hogwash, if you know its far left BS, then aren't you smart enough to see through the fog.  
Trump is a snake oil salesman, and you're buying.
4058 2018-03-12 15:41:50 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
4059 2018-03-12 15:41:49 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
4060 2018-03-12 15:41:43 Wasted our North Sea oil revenues on paying for unemployment,yeah really turned things around
4061 2018-03-12 15:41:42 While waiting for my oil change:
Boy comes in with his food: “umm, I forgot a fork, can I leave this here”
Me (the only other person in the room): stares blankly, then says “I guess, I don’t own the place”. 

Why am I a bitch even when I’m not trying to be??

4069 2018-03-12 15:40:13 Some of you guys tweet “about to get a new whip!” When the reason you’re trying it is because you never got your oil changed and you check engine light has been on since August and your current one is about to explode. Take care of ya damn car smh
4070 2018-03-12 15:40:07 accommodative, not! Out of area customer that's out of oil. they couldn't give me a delivery date, time or work with me... WTF!

4072 2018-03-12 15:40:04 Absolute bullshit. You are selling industrial hemp oil and implying it has some medicinal value?
It doesn't.

4077 2018-03-12 15:39:32 We all have these people in our families.
It's so hard to forgive them. I want to forgive them. They've been fooled, they've bought the snake oil and want, desperately to believe that it's gonna work. But even if it does work the effect they long for is an evil one.

4078 2018-03-12 15:39:10 Still have puts... if oil breaks I could be very happy 
Already scalped aapl calls and got 5cent lotto ticket calls

4080 2018-03-12 15:38:46 Bro the mechanic be trying to get over lmfaoooo talking bout “we suggest an oil change and the full fuel package” my nigga. I came here for JUST a tune up. I’m broke tf 
4081 2018-03-12 15:38:36 I still think it’s a load of snake oil.
4082 2018-03-12 15:38:32 So my bitch of a neighbour set up traps to catch a skunk and ended up trapping my cat now he’s all fucked up and covered in oil

4086 2018-03-12 15:38:07 Oreganol (oregano oil pills) stopped mine, I’ll give up caffeine after I run out of oxygen.
4087 2018-03-12 15:37:46 Oh, don’t get me wrong, I’m alllll for healthy competition. But take companies like Ford and Chrysler that simply destroyed small startups with better mpg engines, but oil companies wanted everyone to force you to buy more of their product. Not healthy competition there.
4088 2018-03-12 15:37:41 Roast butternut squash, onions, and poblano peppers in olive oil, coriander, cumin, s&p. Put into warm tortilla or flatbread with seasoned greek yogurt sauce.  Fab!

4091 2018-03-12 15:36:58 A friend of mine was drinking bullet coffees with coconut oil in it.  After a while, she broke out in a rash.  She probably was just sensitive :)

I can't take stevia or soy. Ha! It's a good thing I'm not lactose intolerant!  
4092 2018-03-12 15:36:58 Moon Rocks - right buds spayed with hash oil then rolled in keif. Consider it the chocolate truffle of herb.
4093 2018-03-12 15:36:24 Tells you how long it's been since I watched, eh? Sitting here waiting whilst the oil in my car is changed. 
4094 2018-03-12 15:36:22 Yep! They actually think the snake oil they are selling will go over big. Maybe a few deranged leftists will step up, but they could always just send more $$ to the Treasury, but don't.
4095 2018-03-12 15:36:11 If oil sands were in que we'd have pipelines in every direction and the lib would be shouting about its greatness, all media scrutinize

4098 2018-03-12 15:35:59 I promise you everyone doing physical labor is in pain. He’s making the world better by not feeding the oil industry.
4099 2018-03-12 15:35:46 Moraleja, no comprar agua destilada NUNCA MAS en la oil 
4100 2018-03-12 15:35:43 Also, inglot's gel liner makes me happy but it can be drying I may start adding drops of oil in there.
4101 2018-03-12 15:35:41 Good article except they omit one extremely important factor in efforts to ban plastics; that the fossil fuel industry is trying to think of ways to increase demand for petroleum based products as the demand for oil drops with alternate sources of energy increase.
4102 2018-03-12 15:35:40 I don’t think so. In the 1910s-1920s, quite a few people married into OK Indian families b/c of oil. It is very plausible she is part Indian. Somewhat Similar to Metis in SDak (whereas your family was a later immigrant arrival)
4103 2018-03-12 15:35:35 Federally, @JustinTrudeau has approved the pipeline so now he should step in and tell BC to play nice and get building... But he won't! He will laugh while this project dies, because he is anti- oil.

4115 2018-03-12 15:34:07 Next time invest in an oil lamp complete with genie, and I don't mean the auto-door opener variety. Learn a little Arabic while you're at it. Or at least German. I hear French is no longer the language of international relations, and English belongs to the FAA. (Braveheart lost.)

4119 2018-03-12 15:33:38 Thatcher inherited the benefits of North Sea Oil, which she proceeded to squander on tax cuts for the middle classes, and benefits for the 3m she made unemployed. She caused a recession that we didn't fully recover from 'til 1988. Not what I call saving us.

4125 2018-03-12 15:32:24 Why is Keystone XL pipeline not being built? The oil/gas industry (especially CAPP) are terrible communicators, no wonder they are losing to the ecoterrorists and weak fighting lib/NDP gov’t @TransCanada @OilGasCanada @aboutpipelines @PipelineAction @OilsandsAction #NEP2

4128 2018-03-12 15:31:55 A healthy alternative to vegetable oil for cooking is high-quality virgin coconut oil.
4129 2018-03-12 15:31:47 That doesn’t include insurance, depreciation, MOT and servicing. Basically all you’re saving is petrol cost and the odd oil change.

4131 2018-03-12 15:31:32 IMO the dolphins don’t get a pass because dumping suh was the right move. They never should have given him this contract to start with. You don’t get credit for replacing the engine in your car before it blows when just changing the oil on time would have prevented it.
4132 2018-03-12 15:31:15 Aaaargh, here is the deal. Putting pineapple on a pizza, aside from tasting great, makes it the healthiest pizza you can eat. The acids and enzymes in the pineapple breaks down the fats in the oil and cheese that are on it. But, who eats anything because it's healthy, right?

4135 2018-03-12 15:31:08 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, and lower wages.

4157 2018-03-12 15:29:34 Yea, if it's coming from a Spanish publication I don't trust it, they fuel a fire more than an oil spill.  If RM is going to be serious buyers for Mo then they better commit to higher than that.  Basically my attitude right now = AIN'T SHOOK.

4179 2018-03-12 15:26:46 For sure, I just used a danish oil to treat it. Honestly it was the easiest part of the project and it really brings out the different colors in the wood!
4180 2018-03-12 15:26:33 @Rachael_Hodges any plans to discuss post treatment detox and diet? So much on internet not sure what is good or not. Eg Coffee enemas. Remove sugar from diet. Cannabis oil? #youmebigc

4184 2018-03-12 15:25:43 The crazy-amazing things Exu Okkada sends me: an original Mexican oil on velvet painting!!! In case you don't know, oil on velvet paintings have been a huge part of Mexican folk art for several decades.
4185 2018-03-12 15:25:33 But you've only answered 1 or your own 2 questions.
"what it means " - Well?
Its not just discharging oil mist, its discharging combusted oil smoke!
What does it do to following drivers view. Is it really <1.8l?

If oil companies are guilty; then those who burn the oil products are accomplices.

So what's behind the distraction?

4210 2018-03-12 15:22:39 @Starbucks could learn something about leaving a good thing alone. Macchiatos are perfect. Please stop trying to make them into something they're not.

4213 2018-03-12 15:22:04 Agree. Simple economics. My point is that even with oil prices at $60 shale oil production in US will increase massively. The cost of some of this wells are around $20 dollars per barrel.

4218 2018-03-12 15:21:28 I mix my body lotion with coconut oil, tea tree oil and aloe glycerine. Right as I exit the bath tub I moisturise with tissue oil, wait for it to penetrate then follow with body lotion.
4219 2018-03-12 15:21:20 I would regard both crop residues and oil seed cakes as by-products too
4220 2018-03-12 15:21:13 If he doesnt have the water and oil, both controlled currently by PKK, Assad cannot stay in power, neither in the medium-- nor long term. I agree that TRs interests and deeds go against those of US.

- Crude oil prices are reverting the initial up tick to the $62.30 area.
- There are no visible catalysts to motivate crude oil to break the sideline theme.
- Next on tap will be the API, EIA reports on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively.

4230 2018-03-12 15:19:58 It’s a doozie. I usually make a punchy mustard vinaigrette to go with this sort of dish but ran out of mustard () but a little drizzle of olive oil was fine
4231 2018-03-12 15:19:55 no wonder Oil of Egg is so expensive...
4232 2018-03-12 15:19:52 Coconut oil always works for me!!
4233 2018-03-12 15:19:45 Life can be a garden of caring and giving, or a junkyard of getting and possessing.   Would you die a rusted piston stinking of burnt oil, or a fallen petal from a blooming rose?

4236 2018-03-12 15:19:35 I roast garlic in olive oil for everything I make.. the smell is fucking hypnotic. From pasta sauce, to chicken, shrimp, and even hashbrowns.
4237 2018-03-12 15:19:29 In the area of Brasilia there is a lot of diamonds, minerals, oil, and iron ore. To make some of our products we would need to have more materials like gold and silver transported to our area. #brasiliaeconomy

4245 2018-03-12 15:17:54 @realDonaldTrump Legalize medical cannabis, it has over 600 powerful medicines in it that can save lives when they are combined into a cannabis oil. I love you President Trump!

4249 2018-03-12 15:17:16 i made eggs and when i was done i let the pan and oil cool and then i poured the oil into a can in the trash. it was a cat food can. upon pouring the oil i quickly realized it hadn't cooled enough and it began to cook the cat food remnants. i do not wish that smell upon anyone.
4250 2018-03-12 15:16:51 What about the Chaplin that ran out to the guy that they covered in paint and tar and were drowning in oil? That guy was insane they said the only reason they didn’t kill the dude was cause the Chaplin ran to him
4251 2018-03-12 15:16:46 I agree it lts not ideal, especially for an oil rich wartorn state with a pegged currency
4252 2018-03-12 15:16:41 IS THERE ANY SCARIER SOUND THAN PUTTING SOMETHING INTO HOT OIL N IT SIZZLES LIKE SATAN IS COMING OUT OF THE PAN
4253 2018-03-12 15:16:28 Dear Bot, that's how it works when companies harm people. The tobacco industry is half of what it used to be. Oil is next.
4254 2018-03-12 15:16:26 The entire system is broken, yeah. Big Oil is the long con (climate change), but Big Pharma is killing people right now.
4255 2018-03-12 15:16:05 With that being said taking my car for an oil change on my lunch

4261 2018-03-12 15:15:00 Almond oil sitting on my curls. I'm trying to do a sew-in so basically I'm not leaving the house today.
4262 2018-03-12 15:14:49 I think a lot of the points in this about Big Pharma could apply to Big Oil too but we really do need an alternative to that second one.  Actually we could use an alternative to Big Pharma too that focuses more on putting the customers first over insane levels of profit.
4263 2018-03-12 15:14:35 Canola oil is actually rapeseed oil but the name was changed in Canada for marketing reasons

4270 2018-03-12 15:13:48 It absolutely is scientific consensus! It's actually 97%, so I was wrong in my first tweet. The only scientists that are truly disagreeing are the ones funded by the oil companies. In regards to your other comment, please come up with something original.

4278 2018-03-12 15:12:17 an oil pan is like 7 euro and a oil filter wrench is around 10, I should really do this, I should learn to change my own fucking oil
4279 2018-03-12 15:12:16 What if the reason we don't have single payer isn't just about the insurance and pharm companies? What if oil and gas companies don't want to see dense datapoints of cancer patients surrounding industrial parks on dot distribution maps?
4280 2018-03-12 15:12:16 Blend an avocado, banana, add some olive oil, & honey and leave it overnight. Its so bomb.

4282 2018-03-12 15:11:44 While tLking about about future crude oil prices, every share market fundit avoids to mention about impending electric vehicle revolution and Saudi Aramco IPO interest in keeping crude at artificial high range. Broker clan to fool people .

4284 2018-03-12 15:11:28 Think they should. Way way back while working in Gulf oil refinery. I belonged to the AFL/CIO. The Democratic party did  lot of great things for the blue collar workers back then. When they started promoting illegals over American workers I switched to Republican.

4293 2018-03-12 15:10:59 I couldn't wash the floor stained with oil from generator properly with broom one time, so my mom collected the broom and gave it to my brother to wash. She then said to me "you will marry a good man and comfortable man , you ll never have to do this".
4294 2018-03-12 15:10:54 Didn’t they shoot an article at you that explained terpenes? Didn’t they explain that they work with the plant? I don’t know what exactly you need. A study? That proves that hemp has terpenes? Bc honestly thought that was common knowledge. Have you tasted hemp oil?
4295 2018-03-12 15:10:46 I’m thinking about getting a oil diffuser instead of constantly buying candles

4320 2018-03-12 15:07:47 Getting my oil changed live update: pulled in, panicked, left, came back

4324 2018-03-12 15:07:09 I've got 'Puter reserved in the boiling oil suite. Perhaps the Media Lounge instead? We're running every episode of 2 Broke Girls, followed by Rachael Ray and The View, and then whatever nonsense CNN is showing.
4325 2018-03-12 15:07:07 Well his catchphrase was

4326 2018-03-12 15:07:03 Dude, Dems are pro-life, & for Wall Street, War, Big Pharma, Big Oil, for #IsraeliCollusion, for #IsraeliApartheid. 
Ok, they're not pro-gun. Good for you if that's enough for you. Got anything else? Otherwise,you have no lessons to teach, friend. Let the adults in the room talk.
4327 2018-03-12 15:06:55 I see Arnold has the time to sue Big Oil for murder (pause here for a hearty guffaw) but couldn't find the time to attend his love child's high school graduation!  Another reason why so many are sick of pretentious Hollywood phonies.

4333 2018-03-12 15:05:57 Just like #MMPRC #MIFCO #STELCO #FENAKA #MPL how the money was used for benefit? You know the details dollar fraud, bankruptcy, oil deal and most importantly the 1.2 billion scandal

4344 2018-03-12 15:04:25 I'll only accept this if Arnie takes on Big Oil like it was a Commando movie, full of explosions and chaos.

But instead it's going to be daft and stupid, with no action and an obvious ending.

4348 2018-03-12 15:03:49 Yeah. When it came out of nowhere and almost touched Thai Airways ko tail I was already our of breathe. Ani it was in unusual speed. Good thing is pilot tried dragging the plane toward pepsicola side.  Otherwise there was Oil corporation. Can't even imagine 
4349 2018-03-12 15:03:30 I hate going to get oil changes ... I be sitting for hrs 
4350 2018-03-12 15:03:20 The butter and the mct oil versions you really need a frother to incorporate them into the coffee or it's oily and gross (and you gotta drink it pretty fast imo), heavy cream is more like half n half but less carbs and more fat and feels a lot more normal lol
4351 2018-03-12 15:03:12 Having to give up an hour of your life just because some reason; oil, war, children not sure which. Why not stick to a time and not change it? We have atomic clocks to keep everything timed correctly now so what would be the big deal just keeping the time the same year round?

4355 2018-03-12 15:02:26 Oil hasn't been changed since they got it

What did our friends in the industry do?
4378 2018-03-12 14:58:48 Storing gas on site or going to get more can be very problematic, depending on the breadth of the storm. We have a GIANT oil tank in the basement, so a diesel makes more sense.
4379 2018-03-12 14:58:30 Oil running out, been told this since I was a nipper in the 70s, should have run out 20 years ago, analysis shows that there is more oil than we’ve ever extracted.

4382 2018-03-12 14:57:59 i thought coconut oil should be the only thing we put on our skin in the 1st place...?
4383 2018-03-12 14:57:44 Use coconut oil and your coconut oil at me here
4384 2018-03-12 14:57:42 You just sacrificed thousands of oil and petrochemical construction jobs to save a few donors who happen to own outdated steel plants who willingly refused to make themselves competitive in any manner. Way to take care of the US worker.

4387 2018-03-12 14:57:14 thank u efficascent oil for being with me through good times & bad times 
4388 2018-03-12 14:57:08 so why to use your time to do one on one teaching if you could be killing it in the markets instead? I don't mean to be rude, maybe it is not snake oil I really didn't check your website, forget I mentioned that. Still, all my other points remain strong.
4389 2018-03-12 14:57:07 just an observation for me. Oil is oversold on 60 min and flirting with hourly trend break
4390 2018-03-12 14:56:57 I used coco butter but it didn’t help any 
I also tried tea tree oil too 
Either you get them or you don’t .

4395 2018-03-12 14:56:21 @OVOEnergy windmills aren't the answer. Solar power is. But climate change is inevitable.. Even if everyone stopped using power. And oil is plentiful... There is more oil than we've been told.. It ain't running out for thousands and thousands of years.
4396 2018-03-12 14:56:15 But it did have an oOil leak 
4397 2018-03-12 14:56:15 Is it just me or are all liberal states or sanctuary citys in term oil. Most of them have extreme amout of homeless and drugs. Not to mention illegals all over.
4398 2018-03-12 14:56:07 I've looked into both. What we should get, if we get one, is a diesel powered generator. Or maybe one powered by NG. We have those on site (lots of oil). Gas comes with it's own issues.

4408 2018-03-12 14:54:18 Dont't lie. I'm venezuelan and we had a strong economy thanks to oil since 1950's. Hugo Chavez destroyed our industry and seized most of our means of production, now we are starving while the communist tyranny kills rioters.

4443 2018-03-12 14:48:46 I am no fan of coal (although I do concede coal is much better than biomass or no energy at all). On the other hand, I am a fan of oil, natural gas and nuclear. Hydro is fine, where it is available. All other energy sources are marginal.

4449 2018-03-12 14:48:24 If you empty the oil via the underneath of the engine and let it drain for a day or two that should clear it all out.
4450 2018-03-12 14:48:23 I would not be too much hyped about this. This will crash oil prices and drive many shale companies into receivership.
4451 2018-03-12 14:48:21 @FirstAidBeauty y’all really played me, i’m so mad that your oil free moisturizer broke me out 0/10 do not recommend
4452 2018-03-12 14:48:19 PS. The words ‘snake oil merchant’ is so perjorative. I don’t think I’ve seen one.
4453 2018-03-12 14:48:17 This could be advertising geared towards the demographic you fit in versus you specifically. Unless there was something in your history that would allow for a prediction that you really like coconut oil. 1/
4454 2018-03-12 14:48:17 I put coconut oil in my hair and leave it in over night and makes my hair really soft and has helped it grow!
4455 2018-03-12 14:48:16 RT @NicolasMaduro: The art of revolutionary politics is to keep the balance in all circumstances and to know how to go forward. The oil price is stable, and the Petro has hit hard. In the pre-sale of the Petro we already have 5 billion dollars, we are on course to prosperity.
4456 2018-03-12 14:47:55 @CREDorg  you guys are bought out by oil and gas and it is sad. Your advisory committee just shows how much people are bought out @denverpost and your ad blitz on popular stations like @1043TheFan is absolutely ridiculous. How much are they paying you to say fracking is safe?
4457 2018-03-12 14:47:53 Why would anyone w/intelligence 'invest' "$200,000 in a dry Texas oil well... & an undisclosed amount in a failed mining stock"? Again, a DRY well & FAILED mining stock?

4596 2018-03-12 14:30:41 Agreed, we did not even try to claim Iraq's oil when we went in there. We are paying the Iraqi's for their oil.

4602 2018-03-12 14:29:55 Well, I think people do "conspire" with eachother all the time. I mean beliefs in climate change means believing oil companies are conspiring to literally destroy the planet and fund tons of fake science which is promoted all over, including lots of "bots" on social media.
4603 2018-03-12 14:29:53 The worst part of waiting for your oil change is that all you smell the whole time is coffee mixed with car grease
4604 2018-03-12 14:29:45 Norway is proof of how well a country can benefit- and big business still want the oil despite the tax. Aus forget they hold all the aces.

4620 2018-03-12 14:27:37 A warm compress is the most effective way to treat a sty. 
The warmth helps dissolve the pus and oil so the sty can drain naturally.
Wet  a clean cotton ball/cloth with warm water. Wring it, so it’s damp, then gently wipe away from the eye

4630 2018-03-12 14:25:58 The alternatives are being developed and of the numerous items that contain oil a cleaner and safer production is being used in the meantime. Many families have been hurt financially by pushing for too much too soon.
4631 2018-03-12 14:25:56 so as the LEFTIES fight against pipelines, the oil is getting out by rail!!  less safe and and will continue to increase as pipelines are not being built! CN has had record years transporting more and more oil!! what say you snowflakes ???
4632 2018-03-12 14:25:43 Spilled some #peppermint oil yesterday and now my bedroom smells like a candy cane.
4633 2018-03-12 14:25:41 As a general rule, packaged truffle anything is oil, and the ‘truffle’ dishes at most restaurants are too. Unless they explicitly say ‘shaved fresh truffle’ or something similar, you’re getting fake oil.

4673 2018-03-12 14:20:42 Agree with main pt but BC ppl protest pipeline from AB. We are net exporter of oil but import from SA anyway. How do you relate the 2
4674 2018-03-12 14:20:38 Really happy to see the KSA Saoudis buying off UK's support and loyalty with their oil money, while the Qatari/MB financed Guardian screaming at the background 'Enough of the shameful kowtowing to the Saoudis'.

4869 2018-03-12 13:58:54 I don't think the threat of sanctions bothers him too much, USA/UK desperately need Russia's natural gas. They're also the worlds largest oil exporter > 5 million barrels a day to EU countries.
4870 2018-03-12 13:58:30 Should have done the IPO in ‘07-8. Just as the oil price spike caused our “good depression”

4873 2018-03-12 13:58:20 We are in process of paying for lost income to oil companies due to storms. They have built-in welfare. Diesel is $1.00 more per gallon than under @POTUS44 soon @GOP will unleash the banks to fleece us more even though they got 14% tax cut.

4876 2018-03-12 13:57:33 I don't have fur (as such) although plenty of other places. Jet wash the engine after you've emptied the oil out. Use a dish/pan by placing it underneath the engine. (Jet wash not to be confused with 'Wake turbulence' sometimes referred to as jet wash).
4877 2018-03-12 13:57:31 Israel stole the land, went to war with lebanon, stole parts of Egypt, claiming oil thta belong to lebanon, bombed Syria, bombed iraq, supports Saudi raids, committing genocide on the Palestinians, illegally settling on their land, and segregating them oh yeah totally defending
4878 2018-03-12 13:57:30 perhaps, or is referring to corn being Iowa's oil? Either way, sloppy writing!
4879 2018-03-12 13:57:27 Money is the connecting force between these countries. Trump, Putin and Xi Jinping all are greedy for money and will do anything for it. Russians influenced US election to get sanctions off of them - they are dependent of oil importation.
4880 2018-03-12 13:57:25 CS: Last week marked the most significant normalization in volatility we’ve seen since the Feb 5th dislocation. Implied vols (1M) fell across asset classes and are now below the 50th percentile for oil, gold, credit, and FX (G7).

4887 2018-03-12 13:56:09 Yes that's whats what it says on the bill thanks so I guess they were giving me a discount before? Although next time in a hour and a half I could have changed the oil myself lol

4890 2018-03-12 13:56:03 Random endocrine disruptors seem to be everywhere. Perhaps the most maddening truth is that the strongest exogenous estrogens are the hardest for men to avoid- petrochemicals. Switch to 100% plant-based toiletries and household supplies. Protect yourself from gas and oil. 
4891 2018-03-12 13:55:54 The steel and aluminum tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump will hike the price of virtually every energy development project, experts say, from oil and gas pipelines to offshore wind and utility-scale solar farms.

4917 2018-03-12 13:52:50 Every fault is attributed to UPA? The fact that low oil prices were prevailing- a huge advantage squandered away. The Land Acquisition Bill was compromised in the beginning, BJP let down the private sector. PM can focus on either Governance or Elections, Modi made his choice.

4922 2018-03-12 13:51:38 Not true. We lobby hard. We should Boycott all products that contain palm oil. Bad for our health, bad for the environment. Palm oil is higher in saturated fat than pig fat. It would be solid at room temperature but for chemical processing. #fat #health #Indonesia
4923 2018-03-12 13:51:20 Ayyyyyyyy, lmao 
4924 2018-03-12 13:51:08 Food prices will definitely drop. EU hols will be no more expensive than they are now. Oil is traded in dollars and the £ is ok against the $, so fuel prices won’t change, unless there’s a global problem. Long  term € will fall. €60bn a month of printing money is unsustainable

4952 2018-03-12 13:47:35 As for Venezuela. Like. It was purely a PR talking point there while the leadership's ignorant friends mismanaged the volatile oil economy there, pocketed the money, and fled the country.

4958 2018-03-12 13:46:56 Yes, of course, it was very simple, just 2 tbs of the vinegar, 3 tbs of light olive oil and a large pinch of salt whisked together. I chose light olive oil so as not to mask the flavour of the vinegar.

4975 2018-03-12 13:45:29 US fracked oil is expensive. Nations with oil & don't need fracking can grab the market if they pump a lower than fracking break even. Remember when oil prices dropped months ago,fracking sites were shutting down. Already pipeline Russia 2 China.

4984 2018-03-12 13:44:19 Conservative Economics Professor taught me 50 years ago that a nation builds wealth only in 3 ways: Natural Resources (coal, oil, etc), Agricultural Products (corn, beef, etc), and Manufacturing (labor). Free trade is only free when there are no subsidies!

Fans will embrace it if the brass is honest. Until Talbot’s gone, nothing changes  @Jmansbox @SteelerOiler
4999 2018-03-12 13:42:14 Its highly flammable oil in both wings, once it gets fire , even in advanced world its hard to extinguish fire. The rescue today is commendable.

5003 2018-03-12 13:41:24 well... they want to sell. and they need a higher oil price to reach that 2 Trn mark..... If they are waiting they will try somehow to make it. Believe we are moving towards the 80/85 area

5007 2018-03-12 13:40:55 If you get a Norwegian drunk* you can often get them close to arguing that having an egalitarian Protestant culture and entrepreneurial Viking spirit makes it easier to find oil.

*make sure you do this in Denmark or somewhere as Norway is hella spendy.

5049 2018-03-12 13:34:14 They are not limited: they are blocking Russian oil companies from doing business with the rest of the world. Also, right after these sanctions took place , Rosneft (who is a part of Exxon) discovered oil in the Arctic, in the North Sea. They desperately want to drill baby drill!

5051 2018-03-12 13:33:51 It can't just be a matter of enforcing some form of expropriation. I think most Canadians want a realistic answer for how to deal with environmental issues, particularly if negligence is involved.

5056 2018-03-12 13:33:00 The reason the beard oil scent fades is because it is only essential oils. There is no other fragrance, which most often contains alcohol to give it the staying power. I'm not SUPER keen to use fragrance oils in them, but I suppose I can.

5060 2018-03-12 13:32:20 The player interaction in this game is so great. When someone delivers oil to your refinery & you have to pay out much-needed shares, it's so awful / great / painful at the same time lol

5074 2018-03-12 13:29:48 If you need to melt coconut oil for a recipe the best way to melt it is to heat it over low heat in a saucepan. Coconut oil will liquefy at 76°,so it will melt fairly quickly. #coconutoil #cookwithcoconutoil #healthycooking

5418 2018-03-12 12:38:24 Also my hair and instead it looks kind of like an oil slick
5419 2018-03-12 12:38:20 Can you paint a realistic oil? Can you fly a plane? Can you design a skyscraper? Can sew a coat? Can you fix a car engine? Is it really that weird?
5420 2018-03-12 12:38:04 I'm supposed to go get my oil changed right when the store opens that way I don't get get stuck there all day but the anxiety of talking to people I don't know it too bad I don't know if I can
5421 2018-03-12 12:37:52 Donald Trump is a liar, a huckster, a snake oil salesman. A New York hustler who cheats and thinks he's a great business man, but look at his many failures!

5427 2018-03-12 12:36:58 They manufacture their petrol out of coal they don't use crude oil. Maybe that is contributing. I am not sure
5428 2018-03-12 12:36:41 Just attended a press conference of Venezuela's foreign minister Jorge Arreaza in New Delhi. Covered topics ranging from local elections to oil, trade, agriculture, US meddling
5429 2018-03-12 12:36:35 You need to keep reapplying the oil periodically - it really is worth it.

5436 2018-03-12 12:35:43 You mean the same Wilbur Ross who lied about his assets to Congress and has money in Navigator Holdings, a shipping company which profits from Russian oil transportation.  Ross has good cause to want Russian sanctions lifted. How does this guy still have a job?
5437 2018-03-12 12:35:41 Producer and supplier of seamless and welded oil country tubular goods, IPSCO Tubulars, filed for #IPO (again). Previously postponed a deal on February 8. No terms. $IPSC

5439 2018-03-12 12:35:38 #IllGetYouBackFor - replacing my cologne with olive oil. I smelt like Papa Italy's kitchen for 3 days.
5440 2018-03-12 12:35:31 But we're not reliant solely on OIL. Scotland has vast resources & OIL was just a wee extra bonus. We were told OIL was running out in 2014 and prices fell due to more inbalance in the Middle East. Yet roll on 2017 and two new giant oil fields were 'discovered' & oil prices rise
5441 2018-03-12 12:35:29 How UR “Intel Community “ regard direct actions taken against Russian influence in Syria, US outpacing Russian Oil production, building up our Military capability, Moving strategic arms 2 Eastern Europe Arming Ukraine All things @BarackObama didn’t do n Putin doesn’t like #Phony

5443 2018-03-12 12:35:20 Pork scratchings are becoming the new superfood due to being low in fats & carbs but high in protein. 43% of pork rind's fat is unsaturated and most of that is oleic acid, the same healthy fat found in olive oil. So I wouldn't worry

5453 2018-03-12 12:32:40 How is Jared working in the White House? Your picks for office are terrible, see the Betsy DeVos interview. Embarrassing! Icahn with the oil fiasco, then the steel stock tip, sad. Take note of the upcoming elections.
5454 2018-03-12 12:32:30 What is Putin saying to Trump in this photo? Something like "You are doing well, grasshopper. Next we want all the oil fields. Send Rex to my office."
5455 2018-03-12 12:32:27 He's doing more than u obviously understand. His energy policy is completely anti-Russian(their economy completely depends on oil/gas export), He's sold arms & missiles to Ukraine for defense against Russia, has upheld prev sanctions & that's why Exxon is pulling out of Ventures
5456 2018-03-12 12:32:27 These people aren't "stupid", they are desperate. And they are your neighbors and relatives. They are given a choice between the candidates of people like you, that insult them and try to ship their jobs offshore, or a candidate that offers them some hope, even if it is snake oil

5563 2018-03-12 12:16:04 Irreconcilable with Western culture? For sure! The West ought to embrace diversity, not invade other countries not meeting ur culture. It was the western civilization that sought people of the East, enforcing western cultures onto others. Invasion, slavery, gold, oil, remember?
5564 2018-03-12 12:15:55 And most of the Scandinavians don't have oil. Venezuela has tons of the stuff. And still! All off the social and economic and environmental problems. Regime change!!!!!!!! Just saying.

5572 2018-03-12 12:14:39 #ukog Martin for me they were 100% production tubing that was going back into the well and probably down to KL1. I am open to a contrarian view.
5573 2018-03-12 12:14:28 It was! Will send you Dom's podcast from the day when it's done, but let's chat about it at the next opportunity too :) Some relevant links to the DEI, pipelines, and the different liquidities of e.g. oil mentioned, so thought of you!
5574 2018-03-12 12:14:28 Frankly..I don't think there was ever any genuine intent of a IPO.  This is another jawboning carrot they will keep on waving year after year:) It will become like the VZ collapse story (repeated every so many times ) and the  #OOTT morons will spread it.
5575 2018-03-12 12:14:24 This oil change better not take forever either.
5576 2018-03-12 12:14:24 เราเห็นที่เขาตอบลค.ในเมนชั่นแล้วแบบ ไม่โอเคอ่ะ ความผิดตัวเองแท้ๆ แต่ก็พูดแบบไม่ค่อยรับผิดชอบ ไหนจะเรื่องหักค่าธรรรมเนียมต่างธนาคารอีก พอคนเยอะเราออกให้หมดไม่ได้หรอก ขอหักนะคะ ไม่โอเคเลย ไม่ได้ว่าแย่แล้ว นี่เสียความรู้สึกมาก เราไม่ได้ซื้อแต่เราเห็นยังไม่โอเคเลยอ่ะ เกินไป
5577 2018-03-12 12:14:24 If you own the biggest oil company in the place with vast deposits, you tend to have a lot of power in a world that relies on oil, it's really simple to understand but it's like people think i'm mental but they must be mental to not see the truth

5586 2018-03-12 12:13:05 Saudi Arabia runs  the UK, the US and NATO, they can do whatever they like, the US has a little more power than most because they have semi joint ownership with Aramco, every war is fought for oil, every child is killed so they can get rich and it's time people woke up to them

5629 2018-03-12 12:06:03 The perpetrator of this crime is an open secret. More important is how the west responds. PNGing a few intel officers will not suffice; they can be replaced. And since many countries still rely heavily on Russian oil and NG, economic sanctions may be hard to impose. Let's see.

Serve on silver platter or Meissen china.
5812 2018-03-12 11:40:33 They all do that now around here (Vue, showcase, Odeon, everyman). I'm not sure if this is the reason, but I used to have a job where I operated one of those hot oil poppers and it was the worst. I was always getting burned and smelled terrible all the time.

5860 2018-03-12 11:33:09 You're definitely right. There's always a side of the story we don't haven't heard. Still give em credit though considering the fall in oil price they've still almost doubled the foreign reserves in under 3yrs
5861 2018-03-12 11:33:07 Why don't we see more women trash collecters? More women coal miners? Oil rig workers? Those are all normal jobs women know about.
5862 2018-03-12 11:32:51 Lots of materials needed to be converted into usable form eg converting organic materials into fertilizer,poly nylon materials into crude oil,and lots of others, tech company like Google on various platforms and lastly make data cheapest commodity to buy in Nigeria

5871 2018-03-12 11:30:46 Ok why did they burn the Kuwaiti oil fields if it was a border dispute then? I thought oil was essentially the dispute which kicked off the initial Iraqi invasion, Kuwaiti rigs directionally drilling under the border into Iraqi oil fields. Those fields burnt hard for a while.

All three offer good upside from the current position, with news on multiple fronts due on each in coming weeks/months, so I hold firm.

6210 2018-03-12 10:32:54 The increase in the foreign reserve was also occassioned by the increase in the oil prices worldwide, not a physical injection from a domestic popular policy of this administration. If you net it off from the foreign and domestic debt you’ll realise that we are in deep trouble.

6244 2018-03-12 10:27:49 Yep. The term "tar sands" is obsolete. I've studied both the Canadian and Venezuelan oil sands, and as far as I can tell they are very similar. The difference is the fraction of dissolved light components and temperature. Venezuela is much warmer.

6266 2018-03-12 10:23:26 It's ridiculous. Canada’s largest oil refinery processes about 320,000 barrels a day, including a full third (!) imported from Saudi Arabia, a third imported from the U.S., and the rest shipped by rail from West Can. Alberta has highest enviro standards yet suffers huge discounts
6267 2018-03-12 10:23:24 Having quality personnel focused on field operations is also useful. This tends to be ignored by oil company managers who were raised in the projects and bean counting sides of the business. I've made a living consulting for some of them, & they can be pathetic.

6281 2018-03-12 10:20:26 Many oil reservoirs tend to have hyperbolic (not exponential as assumed by the unwashed) declines. This is the result of transients, geometry, and heterogeneity. Experience also shows it's possible to "reduce decline rates" by paying attention to business.

6294 2018-03-12 10:17:35 I agree it is possible, but I also feel that the oil industry is paying to suppress the technology to make vehicles more fuel efficient and clean. I drive many, many trucks a week and most of them come off the line only getting between 7 and 9 mpg on the highway, 3 to 5 city.
6295 2018-03-12 10:17:30 Yea, we were on oil when I was growing up. Know that pain all to well also.

6321 2018-03-12 10:13:04 & Trump reinstates tariffs on our steelworkers, sadly, I think Trudeau may need to continue to rely on the oil industry in Alberta. So, I think it's complicated but the PLANET is saying, "We need to divest from Fossil Fuels Now."

6325 2018-03-12 10:12:19 The last admin was doing so well with ramping agriculture produce  but they started spending the reserve before we were fully self reliant. Then the oil dip; we were left with a small reserve which didn't inspire confidence thus investors pulled out. Which made our case worse.

6327 2018-03-12 10:11:46 Yes. Peanut Chutney. Just plain ground peanut mixed with red chilli powder, turmeric, cumin seeds, salt. This needs to be mixed well till the crushed peanuts start oozing out oil....yummy.
6328 2018-03-12 10:11:27 I think that if people see how Islamophobia has been utilised to get to oil resources/access for the oil-hungry West, Islam would cease to be such a potent scapegoat. Let's bust the myths get off the dangerous fossil fuel addiction.
6329 2018-03-12 10:11:14 Interesting that Big European integrated oil companies (Total, ENI, BP, Shell) are more interested in investing outside of the US than in Shale. Suggests that European Refiners dont seem to be too interested in shale as a crude quality.

6439 2018-03-12 09:47:40 Common sense tells you that. Duplicating the whole of the current oil and petrol infrastructure, from production right to fuel station forecourt would cost billions and take years. When the majority of electric car owners will be able to just charge from home.

6585 2018-03-12 09:13:05 All these mentioned advantages can still work with unison as a single nation. Apart from restructuring, I feel it's important for the government to diversify, the sole reliance on oil is another major problem. And no,restructuring is not the only solution. It's bigger than that

6591 2018-03-12 09:12:09 Let's look at the costs, assume £1.20/l petrol and 40mpg consumption, that's 13.65p/mile just for fuel. Our Ioniq does 4.4mi/kWh, assume 5p/kWh off-peak cost, that's 1.14p/mile cost, even at 35p/kWh that's 7.95p/mile, not including oil, filters, spark plugs, cheaper services &tax
6592 2018-03-12 09:11:58 No mystery - The nerve agent is an organic chemical. It's very likely a liquid (a 'toxic oil'). Exactly what it's chemical structure is isn't as important to the public. They just need to be protected from contacting it. So isolate or wash anything that came neat it. Or burn it.

There must have been a time that wars had nothing to do with oil, but not from WW I onwards  WWI's victors also handed control of Arabia's oil to the Wahhabist Saud tribe, in the hope it'd be the best chance for Western exploitation.  Maybe not the best choice.  .

The increase in federal reserves is not a reflection of FG's work on the economy.

The reserves are rising mostly because of the increase in oil prices.

Let me at the outset state that I would rather swallow a bottle of castor oil (in one attempt) than vote or support the lunatics that have organized themselves under the ‘N’ banner.

7005 2018-03-12 07:34:03 Treatment of symptoms. Good short term policy, yes. But the major issues, that drive FX instability and inflation still remain. How much is "under recovery" costing Nigeria? How much have 'non oil' exports grown? Are we still "defending" the Naira?

7030 2018-03-12 07:26:13 it’s not fair that some genetically blessed people can wash their face with idk like dove soap and coconut oil and have perfect skin but if i miss one step of my 6 step routine ONE TIME suddenly my face is 80% pimple 20% skin

7050 2018-03-12 07:21:57 Canola seed oil is better idea. Doesn’t compete with food because it is used to recover fields. Still, electrcity from renewables beats it hands down. EVs also make better cars.
7051 2018-03-12 07:21:46 @1shankarsharma says could have imposed #LTCG Tax 10-12 yrs later &  equity #investments need incentives currently; Will not be surprised if  oil moves 20-30% from current levels

7054 2018-03-12 07:20:46 Turned out to be domestic? As I understand, it can leave as an international departure but change course if they all of a sudden get more money for the oil at home? So don't beat yourselves up, I love your account
7055 2018-03-12 07:20:32 Afghanistan is still sovereign. America holds no mineral rights. No oil rights. In fact if anyone has dibs on minerals it's China. We stand simply and largely as a security and training force.
7056 2018-03-12 07:20:14 I drove on Canola seed oil for years with an Audi A2. Had a tank at home. But it was a mess. If there were pumps distributing it, it would have been better. The overall ecological advantage is limited vs. Electric car possibilities. EVs are just better cars.

7071 2018-03-12 07:16:25 Not for a minute, Just wished we had a vibrant petrochemical industry in Canada producing these plastics. There are so many uses for oil. Burning it is one of the most stupid uses.
7072 2018-03-12 07:16:16 Depends, are you going to also call for the end of subsidies to the coal, oil and gas industries as well?

While we're at it, why not end the coal industry 'subsidies' to the Liberal coffers as well?
7073 2018-03-12 07:16:14 I know u support this & respect ur view: asking oil refiners to transport ethanol & r respond sinks for final product with no control of ethanol is absurd

7143 2018-03-12 07:02:09 If US oil coming on stream causes the price to crash and price is no longer controllable by   and 

Then their populations will no longer be so pliant and things could get quite exciting 
7144 2018-03-12 07:02:09 This coupled with the fact that the world may run out of its need for oil faster than stores are being depleted (which may prompt a race to the bottom on price) - have prompted  and  to fix prices high
7145 2018-03-12 07:02:08 However if the price gets too high, it becomes profitable to exploit even more   shale oil.  (The US is already posed to become the world's largest producer of oil this year).

This will drive the price back down again

Better than medicine.  Joy and love will attract more of same.  That's my goal. Thanks and much love to all in W & G!

7268 2018-03-12 06:29:49 Forwards are a smart way to manage as don’t all fall due same time so they just roll forward and plug any gaps with swaps which is essentially borrowed money. With Eurobonds they have been doing, that is also helping...unless another major oil crash they should be fine for now.

7270 2018-03-12 06:29:35 Hardly fair comparison. Qatar oil and gas is state owned in a JV with Exxon. Larger revenue simply means Exxon gets less. No exploration risk in Qatar and cheap drilling
7271 2018-03-12 06:29:20 If you want to call US affairs in Venezuela the only thing you'll find is a debt we paid from 1930 to 2001 by giving the US discounts on oil which we also used to not send our troops to war in World War II.

7320 2018-03-12 06:13:39 Seems mad that people are so focussed on whether Aramco IPO takes place this year or 2019. Obv has implications for OPEC deal, but investors should be thinking more about long-run oil prices, dividend policy, where it will be listed and what will be listed.

7396 2018-03-12 05:54:20 Question...for those of you with #airfryers, what do you think!? I love fried foods but refrain most of the time. If it tasted the same without all the oil though...
7397 2018-03-12 05:54:17 I pass most of those on the icww, not as many as the headline makes one think,. I feel most work is struggling to keep up with the new export demands. If not careful U.S.A. will be  begging for oil.

Did you emulsify egg yolks w/ oil or is this just Mayonnaise and Sriracha ??

7480 2018-03-12 05:34:27 Well tar sands oil does have a larger carbon footprint than other sources, and it seems a stretch to suggest blocking this pipe would dismantle the pan-canadian framework.

7548 2018-03-12 05:21:08 You're taking incidents under very different circumstances and trying to clam those apply directly to TMX. I pointed out that supply side environmentalism doesn't work ary arresting the user of oil - which is directly relevant.

7553 2018-03-12 05:20:20 We have, as Americans, been taught that money is an indication of success. It is not. Me, I do art. Do I make a lot of money? Sometimes, but not often. I'll give you an example. My uncle is an oil man. The billionaire type. He is on the Forbes list He is now 81-years-old.
7554 2018-03-12 05:20:11 If they thought of themselves as global residents possibly their greed would dissipate somewhat Does any billionaire believe they’re contributing to worldwide pollution if an oil industry of drilling is top of their lists of profits?
7555 2018-03-12 05:20:06 Okay that’s better now here’s some oil

7567 2018-03-12 05:17:57 We don't need ME oil! Period the big oil players on the east coast own tankers useless to them if the wests oil gets east! So they hold the provinces there hostage paying higher prices for fuels!
7568 2018-03-12 05:17:57 Here in Oklahoma, 7% on a gross production tax for oil and gas, more than the 4% they fought tooth and nail to land on was too much of a danger to their donor class. They chose to cut school days and every government body for the second time.
7569 2018-03-12 05:17:49 Not entirely true. Much of their growth and redistribution came from and continues to come from their state-owned oil and gas wealth, which has also been put into government-owned sovereign wealth funds that have been responsibly managed.

7574 2018-03-12 05:15:55 A healthy #economy and a healthy #environment are not mutually exclusive.  All the take, take, take will take a toll on our planet.  The GOP is serving up snake oil.
7575 2018-03-12 05:15:54 Ok, give up every possession they have....... 99.99999% is a derivative of oil
7576 2018-03-12 05:15:32 Seriously, look up HUET on YouTube.  Mandatory training every 2 years for oil field workers.  The training absolutely sucks while you're going through it, but it saves lives.  Helos go down like rocks when they fail, best to be regularly trained how to survive in a crash.

7585 2018-03-12 05:13:56 My concern is that the Union Jack devalues the strawberries. Look what happened to Scottish oil when it had to remain British in 2014.
7586 2018-03-12 05:13:54 I complained because you sent out lazy stupid herrings. Those shows how often oil spills. All we need is one #kindermorgan Aframax flag of convenience tanker to spill in metro vancouver/off coast and we're screwed.
7587 2018-03-12 05:13:23 Oil slick!  Love it!
7588 2018-03-12 05:13:08 Jacinda Ardern has just said that Govt agencies cannot use spy agency Thompson & Clark ... So will @MBIEgovtnz now continue using them in case brought against @RusselNorman and @GreenpeaceNZ for peaceful protest against oil exploration?
7589 2018-03-12 05:12:36 An atypical monday morning, I get woke up to by a frantic call informing me that the engine oil leveller in my Paj has broken and all the oil has gushed out. All 6.5ltrs of it, the oil that was supposed to last another 5500kms.
Hello Monday. I still think we can turn it around.
7590 2018-03-12 05:12:35 Oh so lovely near all the frack sites, breathe those VOCs in deep folks, it’s the wave of the future dream tropolis amid oil and gas wells aka “earthfuckers”.
7591 2018-03-12 05:12:31 does bio oil really work?
7592 2018-03-12 05:12:23 Why do you have to make it so black and white? Why deal in Absolutes?
‘88 Mario put up a performance only rivaled by the greatest, and had his team 1 point out of playoffs. Remove 66 from that team, and remove 97 from his, the 88 penguins would be in the same spot as the 2018 oil
7593 2018-03-12 05:12:19 For me it was bands such as Midnight Oil, Henry Rollins and Billy Bragg.
7594 2018-03-12 05:12:07 Now I just want bread dipped in olive oil.
7595 2018-03-12 05:11:35 It's just a burger bun but with squid ink for colouring. It's eggs benedict but with lobster instead of ham / bacon and just olive oil around the side.
7596 2018-03-12 05:11:32 As they say, correct procedure. I've heard there are people who don't understand the value of a good olive oil on the bread before the sauce. Poor people.

7612 2018-03-12 05:08:14 It is. 
I also brushed the crust with extra olive oil and sprinkled it with salt because yum.
7613 2018-03-12 05:08:12 Buy a bag of frozen riced cauliflower, frozen mixed veggies (peas carrots green beans) n some stir fry sauce. Put some olive oil in a pan, toss in the veggies and cauliflower (let them thaw a lil first) and stir occasionally for like 11 min then add 2 or 3 eggs and then add sauce

7619 2018-03-12 05:07:19 Dealerships have the best oil.
7620 2018-03-12 05:07:17 What to use in Lieu of Pesticides? Neem Oil, Garlic & Clove Oil, Azatrol, StrawFlower Extract... the list goes on!
7621 2018-03-12 05:06:57 I honestly don’t know how to keep my locs moisturized , I just spray them with hot six oil and call it a day .
7622 2018-03-12 05:06:47 I hope to help make that happen even sooner though, because burning oil is causing damage that will be very costly to mitigate in future, and which is likely to cause much suffering to low-income people.
7623 2018-03-12 05:06:12 Syria is finished as a unitary nation state. It will be divided up into about 3 to 4 parts. The Alawai will be hunted and driven to flee to Iran. It's over for them and the Druze. Kurds keep the northeast with the dam power and oil. Sunnis can join. Alawi will flee. Russians too.
7624 2018-03-12 05:06:10 The only thing that I have recently tried that has helped a smidge is vitamin e oil... helps seal ends and moisturize a bit. So somewhat helps ehhhh
7625 2018-03-12 05:06:05 Too bad because he has a large platform and is doing a disservice to the industry and the tech. He also pays it as if he is very very wealthy but at the same time pushes his educational "products' like snake oil.
7626 2018-03-12 05:05:52 "Early on, we wanted to test the idea and find out what's underneath all this gravel so we ran some seismic reflection. Hard rock geologists rarely do seismic reflection, but oil geologists do it all the time." Tim Marsh @BellCopperBCU

7630 2018-03-12 05:05:23 why not make a bet then, like Ehrlich did? He predicted that rare metal prices were sure to increase. He lost. If oil becomes more scarce as demand increases, then its price should skyrocket. Do you expect that to happen? I reckon by 2050, oil isn't worth pumping.
7631 2018-03-12 05:05:11 you smoke weed you drink the oil
7632 2018-03-12 05:05:06 My dad worked in the oil patch. He was away A LOT. When away on my birthday he'd fax - yes, FAX - a birthday card to my school for me. 
7633 2018-03-12 05:04:52 Okay how was the economy broken. The NDA inherited a fiscal windfall when oil prices tumbled by over 70% within months of them taking charge.

7638 2018-03-12 05:03:37 Can't find videos on YouTube about hydrogenating oil into wax without seeing a bunch of videos about people making fucking thc wax

Though perhaps the chemistry is the same?

7648 2018-03-12 05:01:24 But not as bad as your god father GEJ. Mr. GEJ is the worst president in the history of Nigeria he failed in all aspects power, security, economy, corruption, crude oil theft, foreign relations, mining etc.
7649 2018-03-12 05:01:15 I think some of the tea tree and peppermint oil from my hair seeped into my sleeping mask cause my eyes are tingling

7682 2018-03-12 04:55:00 Venezuela is a good example in where we are heading , an oil rich country etc....
7683 2018-03-12 04:54:55 ooooh chinese food! but wait, you’re staying in canada right? (i hope my memory didn’t fail me) hahahah omg same, the amount of seasoning/ oil is overwhelming in western cuisines
7684 2018-03-12 04:54:44 Like i said, after he planned for Arab unity and taking control of oil to cut off the west, he was smeared and hunted down. You think America killed him for the good of Libyans? Where are they now as there's slavery and civil war there?
7685 2018-03-12 04:54:37 oh ! There is only one fundamental concept. Flash cook. Meaning, cook in high heat, high pressure for less time. Use a little oil for avoiding adi-pidiththal. Add salt to bring water out and self cook. Everything else you can derive/tweak as you wish :)

7688 2018-03-12 04:53:12 Yeah literally go to the grocery store and get pure coconut oil. I use it for everything! Skin and hair. It made my natural curls come back in my hair from being so heat damaged. That stuff is god sent

7691 2018-03-12 04:52:38 I’m watching a cooking show and this man really took the chicken right out of the packaging and put olive oil into a pan then started to cook THE UNSEASONED CHICKEN I legit couldn’t believe it
7692 2018-03-12 04:52:19 It was totally improvised. I chopped about 1/3 of a red onion in my food processor and sauteed it with 2 cloves of minced garlic + cumin + chilli powder in avocado oil.

7697 2018-03-12 04:51:06 I’ve used products that have coconut oil in it but not coconut oil on its own!! Next on my list 
7698 2018-03-12 04:50:51 Showered , moisturized , slathered in coconut oil , candles on w some Pink Floyd I’m out yallllll
7699 2018-03-12 04:50:49 too bad the government of the island supports the communists assassin dictatorship of Maduro, just to get cheap oil!
7700 2018-03-12 04:50:47 I travelled through #somalia and saw that people fight over land not because of scarcity but because of pride. The resource we need is not oil but trust and understanding as a nation state we are one whole family who share everything. #FinePeoplefromSomalia

7706 2018-03-12 04:50:07 Don't forget the oil prices that hit every aspect of economy including kingfisher.
7707 2018-03-12 04:50:02 Yah, that’s us after eating the oil money.

7715 2018-03-12 04:48:26 Extremes?  It's history.  And we got to the moon because of German scientists we "invited" to the USA after WWII.  (It was pretty much us or the USSR, so guess which most chose.)
7716 2018-03-12 04:48:25 @CliffCentralCom we cycle because chicks look hot in lycra, you chop! Ride a bike, burn fat not oil!!
7717 2018-03-12 04:48:15 Medium high for gas; Medium low or Low high for electric never add more oil of any kind unless you want over greasy eggs  Most important; wait for your pan to get hot before you add anything. Test how hot your oil is by how fast it toast a piece of bread like a crouton

That's why I only went to ND for the oil money. -30° sucks.

7732 2018-03-12 04:46:07 All well and good; for some reason the MSM won't carry positive stories about the oil and gas industry. Voices like Mr Craig are a cry in the wilderness.
7733 2018-03-12 04:46:05 Don't let your hair get into your face while you sleep. The oil from your hair can cause acne.
7734 2018-03-12 04:45:58 Now we cut deals with Saudi Arabia, who owns the drilling company used to dig said oil. 2+2 doesn't equal 5. War on terror yet billion £/$ deals with a terror state with identical laws to ISIS.
7735 2018-03-12 04:45:19 Is quite difficult to find essential oils here for my hair so im using a massage oil which is just subflower oil, lavender extract, and coconut oil. My hair is soft now nice

7738 2018-03-12 04:44:56 Workmate sat through a meeting today sullenly eating her lunch. Which consisted of leftover, dry-roasted (i.e. not cooked with oil) root veges and raw green beans.

I'm no vegan, but I'm sure being vegan doesn't require taking all possible joy out of food. But, oh well.

7750 2018-03-12 04:42:53 Can't wait till some one mentions the real reason they let ISIS back in. It'll become clear then why they want people silenced. The only reason you would reward terrorists with housing and benefits is because they've done a job for you. Which job? It's obvious, oil field control.
7751 2018-03-12 04:42:35 Crazy how my colleague wasn’t convinced that I said nigella oil is good to use for the skin & to consume for health. She wasn’t convinced at first until I said it’s sunnah nabi, then she was like oh ye ke? Bruh if it isn’t meaning you refuse to believe it’s natural benefits?

7756 2018-03-12 04:42:05 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.

7758 2018-03-12 04:41:57 I didn't really get to know midnight oil until after I was already politicised.
7759 2018-03-12 04:41:56 Desjardins Group willing to invest in oil pipelines as part of its strategy "to support the transition to clean energy." 

Sure, like people taking up cigars as part of a plan to quit smoking cigarettes.

My personal favorite is the spill over on a motor oil can that leaves a nice dark ring on your fresh wood.
7762 2018-03-12 04:41:33 Although I 100% recommend a Vet, you could just let nature run its course and hope your fish is healthy enough to make it through & adjust to 1 eye. But he could get an infection. I think the reality is that your fish will have to be humanely euthanised with clove oil.
7763 2018-03-12 04:41:24 So you believe in the science that says man is causing the earth to warm...but not in science that says we can transport oil far more safely today than we could in the 1980s?

7770 2018-03-12 04:38:57 Canada doesn't have "tar-sands", we have Oil-Sands. The US has tar-sands though if that helps you with writing factual tweets. Second, tank farms have secondary containment for leaks, meaning the oil never hits the ground or water. #stopkm #ProtectTheInlet #bcpoli #ableg #canpoli
7771 2018-03-12 04:38:53 Why is Venezuela so oil rich and their people are now refugees. I hear they are crossing over to Guyana as well, going from poor to poorer.

7774 2018-03-12 04:38:27 It was a bad law that infringed on those that had no real issues. My friend who fell from an oil rig 40 feet and breaking bones on everything he hit, was required by work comp to see a shrink about fears to return to the rig. No criminal history & law kept him from a gun purchase

7780 2018-03-12 04:37:00 Isn't it ludicrous? There are many reasons that people choose to pursue a career in science - but getting rich sure isn't one them! There are also many reasons that a person may choose to become an exec at an oil company - but wanting to do right by ANYONE sure isn't one of them!

7791 2018-03-12 04:34:58 If Alberta really cared about BC and getting the oil to us in this time of sudden gas price increases they would try to show they are a good neighbour and offer it cheaper. Truth is this all going to China. We could freeze for all Rachel cares.

7821 2018-03-12 04:29:11 Makes sense. Similar to how we need to stop exploring for oil we cannot burn, and how we need to reduce the number of nuclear weapons to a total less than enough to cause our extinction.

7852 2018-03-12 04:24:06 Cost of living in major city centers is a natural result of free markets. Wynne is not sitting in her office wondering 'how can I make Toronto unlivable'. Quite the opposite, she's trying to keep it affordable for low income families. Ford is a snake oil salesman. (1/2)

7862 2018-03-12 04:22:35 Tried to debate this with @Lidsville reading her blog and asking questions and I got blocked. The more I see the anti-fossilfuel movement the more I see it's a fact based philosophy.  We aren't in a transaction period. We need oil

7918 2018-03-12 04:10:25 Condo was an oil and gas whore ftom her earliest days.  Yes, she repped Tillerson knowing his lack of state savvy would tank our state department and pave the way for no sanction enforcement. 

Vendettas never fade from a repubs mind and heart.  $$$ rule. Exxon stock.
7919 2018-03-12 04:10:24 Crude oil has been marked to market prices, all economies gained or lost relative to the share in their import basket

Example apart from India: japan

7925 2018-03-12 04:09:21 Most of it is industrial growth but “industrial growth” includes oil and not what you are talking about in terms of industry. I agree with what you are saying, and it would be the optimal outcome; but it’s a work in progress, and we wait and see - as there are some great plans!
7926 2018-03-12 04:08:59 I don't see McDavid in the mix this season for Hart, the Oil just not good enough though he is their MVP by far.  I'd add Giroux into the mix of the 5 and Hall has been lights out important for the Devils - both serious alternatives to MacKinnon IMO

Recipe 1:Chop ze veggies, add oil, heat up, sauteed.

Recipe 2: chop half veggies, blend other half, boil those fuckers together.
7933 2018-03-12 04:06:44 1. I stand corrected. Not all agreed.
2. Approvals from Canada and Alberta, with BC's in limbo. Standing Rock 2 started and PMJT will *never* bring in the forces. 18 court cases o/s. price going up. KM doesn't have the $ raised. oil prices dropping.  

This will never get built.

7935 2018-03-12 04:06:19 The reason oil has the role it has is rooted much more in chemistry and physics than politics or ideology. This is why plugging one supply will simply cause another to take its place and why it's a useless endeavor. You have to address overall demand first

They fell for the snake oil, we got penicillin.
7939 2018-03-12 04:05:14 A lot of the immigrants move to Europe because of Britain and other western governments oil wars. Islamic countries, contrary to popular belief, have sheltered many, but the rest flee to Europe.

7958 2018-03-12 04:01:41 Victim mentality! Since 2003, you had a golden chance to create a democratic, developed and liberal enclave to be envied by the whole region. Instead, oil rentiership, tribal conflict and oligarchy. Once u fix things internally, the whole world will support independence.
7959 2018-03-12 04:01:37 Its not translating into anything at the moment - its driven by oil. That sector is foreign dominated too and doesn’t employ a lot of locals; so the average Ghanaian is not involved much from what I know!

7962 2018-03-12 04:01:14 As someone who was a bit too young for the 91-92 season how did the Kevin Lowe lead Oil make the Conf finals?
7963 2018-03-12 04:01:09 But don;t forget to tell them the $AUD is rising against the $USD in which #Brent #oil is priced, as well!

7972 2018-03-12 03:59:45 You think the present “government of the North” is worried beyond 2019? No, they are not! Btw, the moment more than 300,000 people paid @Tesla $1000 each for #Model3 was when i realized that we’ll soon drink that our oil!

7976 2018-03-12 03:59:08 @AllenLone  How was CERAweek. Hope you were representing v.moo and v.aao at the who's who oil and gas show.  Sitting behind a desk in TO isn't getting things done.!
7977 2018-03-12 03:58:55 It is a very healthy oil, actually.
7978 2018-03-12 03:58:54 This season, God will exchange your ashes and ruins for beauty and newness. HE will lubricate your mourning and frictions with Oil of unspeakable joy and gladness.
HE will barter your heaviness and worries with garment of praise.
You are now refined to manifest in His glory IJN.

7985 2018-03-12 03:57:50 .. It gives us no satisfaction whatsoever to see trapped traffic in an incident and rest assured from early in this event we were aware of the difficulties. A contra flow incident creates a lot of challenges which are not easily overcome.. 12 litres of oil were spilt
7986 2018-03-12 03:57:48 We get our daily dose of vegetables but with unnecessary amounts of oil

7992 2018-03-12 03:56:47 Yes Arsenal needs a leader in the centre. And Henrikh's game is much better suited to Arsenal rather than United. This team is supremely talented with players like Ramesy, Wilshere, Oil, Mkhi, Auba. 
Desperately needs a Veira/Keane mood and may be change of management :p

7995 2018-03-12 03:56:20 I dunno. I feel like this sort of thing happens a lot. I remember reading that most "extra virgin olive oil" actually isn't EV (and some of it isn't even olive oil). Never heard of any suits. I bet "food fraud lawyer" would be, if nothing else, a very interesting career.

8006 2018-03-12 03:53:52 Petrol price have eased in most capital cities. However, global crude oil prices are rising again (Brent crude oil +1.7% to US$65.49 a barrel) as Korean geo-political risks recede and record US production takes a breather. It might be time to fill-up now #ausecon #petrolPrice

8009 2018-03-12 03:53:15 Does the Cadbury use palm oil? If not then the nutella is MUCH more carcinogenic.
8010 2018-03-12 03:53:10 Yep! Even once would be nice.

8012 2018-03-12 03:51:37 Politeness Is The Oil Which Reduces The Friction Against Each Other.
8013 2018-03-12 03:51:24 Because if a whale oil broker explained to me why whaling should be legal, I wouldn't lend him as much credence as a Marine Biologist

In the same way as a male if I were to explain why people above 5'11 should continue to be regarded as more attractive, it's a bit suspicious.
8014 2018-03-12 03:51:17 Oil goes up
8015 2018-03-12 03:51:15 Until the US is 100% renewable, can someone translate 0.34% into a more accessible unit of measurement - like millions of barrels of oil or thousands of tons of coal for Guido & his compatriots' sake?

8017 2018-03-12 03:51:12 US "remittances to Mexico in 2017: $26 billion (more than Mexico oil revenue pegged at $18 bil).  
Fat tax or fed wire transfer fee or both would pay for that wall.
8018 2018-03-12 03:50:42 @UChiEnergy it seems you support all forms of energy #oil #gas #wind #solar?   Correct?
8019 2018-03-12 03:50:31 ばらばらーーーーーｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗ
8020 2018-03-12 03:50:10 Still better than gas because electricity can come from many sources, but gasoline only comes from oil and a bit of ethanol.
8021 2018-03-12 03:49:58 Have you tried CBD OIL take a look @Simpson_Rick 
8022 2018-03-12 03:49:58 i need a spa day with a real massage not the kind where they oil you up pretend to rub your butt and try you
8023 2018-03-12 03:49:52 ばりかっこよかったっす
8024 2018-03-12 03:49:22 In my view this is  a sign we will get another confrontation about market share,leading to low oil prices.
8025 2018-03-12 03:48:47 So you are fine with letting Diebold running manipulable election machines with no public transparency or accountability? You're fine with having a middleman profiting from your banking so they can invest that money in arms manufacturers, prison privatization, and oil companies?
8026 2018-03-12 03:48:40 coconut oil is such a blessing
8027 2018-03-12 03:48:34 That wildgrowth oil is responsible for me having eyebrows now 
8028 2018-03-12 03:48:32 I just used oil paint & 10 seconds in i got it on my leggings 
8029 2018-03-12 03:48:11 I don't usually use beard oils or balms because the oils from your skin are good enough. The only time I use an oil or balm is when I shampoo the beard and need to replenish the oils the shampoo stripped from the beard.
8030 2018-03-12 03:47:52 The oil and gas and tobacco industries learned well when their scientists on payroll were outed.. NRA taking it to a whole new level
8031 2018-03-12 03:47:26 1. Voter turnout. 18% in off year elections. Why low turnout. GOP so dominant, there is apathy your vote won't matter. Why? The millions & millions $ from NRA, oil, & religious right extremists. Also, almost no funds from national DNC since we're considered lost cause.
8032 2018-03-12 03:47:17 It is all about oil and natural gas energy. Once the bloodshed is over, there will be a pipeline through Syria.
8033 2018-03-12 03:47:15 True life: I can’t sleep without my oil diffuser on
8034 2018-03-12 03:47:10 Years ago.  I mute every game I watch.
8035 2018-03-12 03:47:04 I mean, the rise in the Dow attributable to the selling of snake oil is maybe 5%, max. For the NASDAQ it's a bit higher.
8036 2018-03-12 03:46:46 Nineth, Most of the anti CANADIAN oil groups are funded by American billionaires and Saudi princes. Neither you or anyone marching to their tunes see one dime but make no mistake, you work for them.

8038 2018-03-12 03:46:27 He is a cult leader and very dangerous.  He is also just about profit.  His Dad testified that they would say just bout anything for $$. I tried to leave for years, opposed the snake oil.  Domestic abuse/I was isolated/indoctrinated. Trying to make it right. I regret.

8043 2018-03-12 03:46:04 It’s for giving hair volume actually, but there are other Lush products which would be good for dandruff. Anything with tea tree oil and/or peppermint would be good too.  Or try the most common remedy-apply some lemon.

8051 2018-03-12 03:45:15 Eight, who owns the rail tanker cars used to transfer our oil to the US? Warren Buffet. And he has direct interest in keeping oil inland so he can make $$. He doesn't care about you, me or BC's coast but he'll fund opposition because $$$
8052 2018-03-12 03:45:13 Ideals our politicians follow are petty parody of greed for money & power. Nothing much, nothing less. Evident they are feeding on ignorance of uneducated & poor. Snake oil sellers don't last, but we've got lots. Nepal needs #education to rid of this pests & #soonWewill together
8053 2018-03-12 03:44:49 It's so odd that some think that to critique the economic & energy system in which we find ourselves we must somehow stand outside that system - in some completely imaginary place that does not exist - or it's hypocrisy. That's nonsensical. We can only criticize oil from within.
8054 2018-03-12 03:44:41 i really hope my mom wants to eat at red robin with this $4 off $10 thing i have when she’s off and we go get my oil changed in my car because i have been CRAVING their whiskey river bbq veggie burger.

8069 2018-03-12 03:43:19 Sixth, Since the Exxon Valdez incident, tankers are required to be double or even triple hulled for safety. Seventh, Presently, Canadian oil is transported by rail to US refineries. How safe is rail? Two words...Lac Megantic. Look it up.
8070 2018-03-12 03:43:14 I HATE the taste of extra virgin olive oil it's so disgusting my mom always tries to sneak it in my food!! I NOTICED BITCH
8071 2018-03-12 03:43:00 It is not about just finding a resource but harnessing it in such a way that it produces sutainable development, genuine wealth and good quality of life. In both Guyana and Grenada there is concern that oil profits will be expatriated elsewhere.
8072 2018-03-12 03:42:59 Good to see that the oil and gas lobbyists are still buying our government 
8073 2018-03-12 03:42:56 Saw a clip of her saying that she recommended Rex! Exxon and Putin's oil have a deal. They could corner the oil market. Screw US consumer!
8074 2018-03-12 03:42:55 Who?
8075 2018-03-12 03:42:54 The world energy demand continues to climb. We as Canadians import Saudi oil. Ridiculous in my mind. The world needs oil and LNG why should Canada not partake. We have pipeline capacity issues now. Is rail the answer.

8103 2018-03-12 03:39:48 C’mon Canada  wake up!  US stealing us blind  - paying anti-oil activists so they can buy oil cheap then sell high making billions. Keep it in the ground? - no way - get it to tide water-  oil is for s people.
8104 2018-03-12 03:39:44 Every time I cook steak indoors, I set off the smoke alarm. The high temp of the cast iron vs the fat of the meat and the oil & butter in the pan = smoke and airborne fats.

The mayo for fries contains a bit more vinegar and has slightly less oil. No garlic.

8166 2018-03-12 03:29:41 Currently I’m taking fish oil, vit D, curcumin, probiotic, 5htp, vit B12 and a Chinese med called cordyseng. I do think 5htp helps with my sleep, and I think the others help a bit with other symptoms. No huge game changers though.
8167 2018-03-12 03:29:40 [] Shanzhai oil money tricked Suning Financial Institute? The real petrocoin is still in private equity.

8183 2018-03-12 03:26:05 A money-worshiping Big Oil lackey who's doing everything he can to undermine the important environmental regulations that keep our water & air clean. Doesn't understand his own job description, which is "Protect the Environment." Evil or stupid or both. Hates average Americans.
8184 2018-03-12 03:25:56 We are close to be oil independent. Will affect only Japan and other oil importers.
8185 2018-03-12 03:25:55 @TheGateKeeper @stocklad yeah 2-3 Tbs of oil in a heavy pot on medium, put 3-4 kernels in there, when 1pops, throw 1/2 cup popcorn in-cover
8186 2018-03-12 03:25:39 I really need to pick up some CBD oil bc I’m very sensitive to sugar and I’ve been spooning this CBD honey into my mouth non stop for 3 days

8189 2018-03-12 03:25:13 (1) I'm not suggesting that the government cares, that's exactly my point. Do you understand irony? (2) I'm not going to provide you with everything. Scientific papers on the statistics of oil spills are a simple Google search away.
8190 2018-03-12 03:25:13 Why did May & other protesters use diesel powered ferry to protest? No transport powered by wind (sail boat) or solar? BTW cell phone & plastics made of oil. Elec cars use batteries from China and no way to dispose.  Windmills bigger carbon footprint vs benefit. Solar =plastic

8192 2018-03-12 03:25:00 Perhaps. But, from design aspect, older demio with appropriate plug might be best shot. 2nd thought makes me think It harder to do this with a oil plug as opposed to a random screw on units I work on.
8193 2018-03-12 03:24:59 You have that same arrogance.  You think Jason Kenney cares about You and Yours. Haha. Big oil and big tax cuts to the boys who own you and work you like a monkey.

8206 2018-03-12 03:22:48 I personally would recommend a rub of oil on the ribs, then rub them with a seasoning which contains sugar and salt but in light proportions, while mixed with a good blend of herbs, pepper, and spices. Cook at 225 for 5 hours for baby back, 6-7 hrs for St. Louis cut

8237 2018-03-12 03:17:47 No. Only climate change denier Ontariio right wing boozos want to cancel all means of dealing with climate change. Sure glad you joined with Ford. Next thing I expect to hear from you is that you single handedly, miraculously
put Alberta oil and gas in the ground yourself.
8238 2018-03-12 03:17:32 My eye is really messed up from getting doused in holy oil today in church. And I just can’t make myself believe this was God’s plan
8239 2018-03-12 03:17:03 I rise,
Not as a phoenix,
Or a ghost,
Or as the sun and her shadow.
I rise at the hands of holy restoration,
At the feet of golden pavement and fire and tongues,
I rise—
Not in duty to myself,
Not for Roman happiness,
Or the promise of oil and wine, 
But in perfect submission.

8257 2018-03-12 03:13:20 Its despicable exploitation, esp since our government is executing or sending to slaughter all our Wild Horses, & NO ONE in media is helping to STOP or SAVE, They R killing the Wild horses not because they are overpopulated, thats a LIE, its because they want the land for OIL

I live in Tx and the oil industry is booming! Crews working 24hs a day.
It's a beautiful thing. 
Keith, we need others but we have to negotiate better deals.

8261 2018-03-12 03:12:49 Right and wrong are like oil and water you can not mix no matter how hard you try.

8264 2018-03-12 03:12:01 Minimise heat (hair dryer/straightner ect) if possible. If not, I recommend Pureology Reviving Red Oil. Just a drop or two on your hands and run it through to the ends before you use heat.
8265 2018-03-12 03:11:58 Here's a treat you use a little bit of olive oil so the butter doesn't burn.

8280 2018-03-12 03:08:57 Bad old man what passes for thinking. Tax it the only idea they have.
You push biodegradable and create methane release.
Collect plastic, burn it for power, its oil.
8281 2018-03-12 03:08:45 Hi, I replied to Charles, but want to say great interview. @brianlilley  may want to speak with you. Foreign money spent on CDN elections & against Alb oil is direct attack on our democracy and prosperity.
Hope MSM will finally catch on.

8289 2018-03-12 03:07:15 For the last few months, I've been using Dr. Dennis Gross' Hydration Booster, but I've previously used Drunk Elephant's marula oil, organic Moroccan Argan Oil and organic rosehip oil. The Hydration Booster gives me the moisture of a serum and oils combined. I really like it!
8290 2018-03-12 03:07:14 Keep your mineral oil on deck. You don’t have to get ready if you stay ready
8291 2018-03-12 03:06:44 ماشاء الله تبارك الله الرحمن الرحيم
8292 2018-03-12 03:06:23 Use a comb instead of a brush and comb when it's still wet instead of dry. Avoid using a brush as this not only makes the hair frizzy it drags the oil from the scalp through the hair, making your hair oily/waxy.

8294 2018-03-12 03:06:05 Baby oil rubbed over a nice size chocolate ass 
8295 2018-03-12 03:05:51 Ok. Well we’ll see what happens... I’m thinking of saute in some oil to help with crispness maybe? Here’s hoping 
8296 2018-03-12 03:05:30 Get to drinking that oil.
8297 2018-03-12 03:05:20 Don’t tell my folks I’m trash working in a oil patch.... they think I’m a piano player at the local whore house
8298 2018-03-12 03:05:01 Saw that. Demand going up and down. Many signs that demand will be less than expected due to high speed rail, EVs, dockless bike share, etc. Plus Saudis planning on selling state oil co. Sure sign they don’t see a future in oil.

8303 2018-03-12 03:03:59 It’s funny because in the technology sector, I see a disproportionate number of personnel who are of Indian ancestry (many recently immigrated). And this isn’t merely anecdotal, but a verifiable phenomenon.
8304 2018-03-12 03:03:55 Well none of them will really define hair they just seal. My go to’s right now are jojoba or argan oil . Honestly imo i use anything but coconut lol and castor oil is too thick for every day use
8305 2018-03-12 03:03:12 Ah I’ve seen those around. Guess I’ll try one when this coconut oil runs out lol.

8310 2018-03-12 03:02:42 I think Washington state is OK, besides the little oil they get from trans mountain (20%) for their Pugent sound refineries tankers is their only option Most already comes from Alaska by tanker- no tankers no fuel & they know it's been proven to be safe
8311 2018-03-12 03:02:36 Ok so usually i will use peppermint oil to help with my congestion... but today that shit aint help.... now my damn room just smell like ya grandma purse after church...
8312 2018-03-12 03:02:15 What sort of hair do you have friend? Thin or thick, straight/wavy/curly? Your options depend on length, type, how long you feel like growing it out, and how often you've bleached or otherwise treated. I find that argon oil is good for my curly hair's health but yours may differ.

8355 2018-03-12 02:55:10 Drove 110 Km to North Battleford today. We saw 5 Trains all shipping oil.These trains were at least 2Km long each and  all oil Tankers.   1. No wonder grain can’t get to port.
2. I guess no pipeline ,so use rail tankers. Very inefficient and dangerous.
8356 2018-03-12 02:55:03 The logic by you is that US doesn’t need any part of the rest of the world . You just mentioned the US is a net exporter of oil. How can we export if other countries hate us & tell us to keep our oil they’re not buying .

8376 2018-03-12 02:50:52 Kinda expensive option: Josie Maran’s Argan Oil (been using and loving it for like 5 years)

More affordable: Rose hip oil!
8377 2018-03-12 02:50:34 Ok make your own sugar from sugar beet.
Shell all your own peas, beans.
'Process' milk yourself to make butter.
Press rape seed yourself to make oil.
There are economies of scale.
Make your own baked beans for 25p a can.
8378 2018-03-12 02:50:33 Fry em up in a little oil and make tacos with some soft white cheese, onion and lime! Batter them if you wanna go all out
8379 2018-03-12 02:50:28 Cilliza is a roving reporter for juvenile high school newspaper CNN seems "cool".  Sad and pathetic.
8380 2018-03-12 02:49:52 Since we have a marching camp in like April, remember kids: if you're in a pinch and run out of water, Blue Juice valve oil is an excellent way to get hydrated fast
8381 2018-03-12 02:49:33 Sometimes I buy fancy creams or oil blends, but I find the most effective thing is to layer an acid (glycol for acne days and hyaluronic for moisture). I’m almost 35 and get skin compliments often. Ohh! Honey masks are awesome! Moisturizing and antibacterial and freeeee
8382 2018-03-12 02:49:14 Better be. I've run out of beer and witty things to say. You'll be glad to know that a few of us at work, turned the bosses car into a travelling Pearson's Brass Hand Oil sales machine.
8383 2018-03-12 02:48:47 Let me guess: everything you know about the oil sands you learned from Greenpeace?
8384 2018-03-12 02:48:45 Jika kulit sensitif sbb salah guna produk. Pakai:
Vitamin E Makeup Remover
Tea Tree Oil Purifying Mask
Tea Tree Oil Anti Blemish Xpress

Untuk surutkan jerawat yg timbul. Guna utk sebulan dulu. once jerawat dah okay baru blh gunakan yg lain (cth cleanser, toner, moist dan lain2)
8385 2018-03-12 02:48:37 $CL_F The rally from 2/10 low ($58) looks impulsive and while above there, #Oil could see at least another leg higher #elliottwave
8386 2018-03-12 02:48:35 There is definitely a period of time that has to happen while it adjusts. Your hair will overproduce oil for a time because you wash it every day. It generally takes 4-6 weeks to get to a new normal, and it won't feel the same but will feel healthier. Ultmiately it's ur head tho.
8387 2018-03-12 02:48:27 castor oil and stridex wipes will work some mf miracles on your skin 
8388 2018-03-12 02:48:25 haha.. sina shida na oil and grease. It is really about time.
8389 2018-03-12 02:47:49 Biafrans have said this time without number. Take our oil but let us go, let's be free. Let us have our culture back. Biafra is written in our blood and it be changed. We are Biafrans forever.
8390 2018-03-12 02:47:43 Vaporin refreshing oil 
ONHAND ONHAND 
130 each only
Save up to 40php from pharmacy srp
8391 2018-03-12 02:47:32 So you’re suggesting the UN index is flawed?  Or admitting you know nothing about the working conditions in the oil sands?  Because with the exception of some pretty long hours, it’s a great place to work. Unless you have evidence to the contrary? Thought not.
8392 2018-03-12 02:47:18 I'd bet there's at least a first aid course at a hospital/fire/police w/in driving distance.
8393 2018-03-12 02:47:11 just anointed my hair with oil and im going to relax for the evening
8394 2018-03-12 02:46:56 I hate when I have tea tree oil on my fingers then accidentally rub my eyes. I think I’m blind right now.
8395 2018-03-12 02:46:43 Shall we find you good beard oil
8396 2018-03-12 02:46:32 I can finally take a bath in my new house and thanks to @lushcosmetics  I can do it in the most relaxing way ever with the floating island bath oil like seriously my body is so soft rn
8397 2018-03-12 02:46:13 Dean-Gold, Sam...soft amber. Cas, isn’t really one color. He is like a multicolored black (like an oil slick) splashed over a white-blue sky.
8398 2018-03-12 02:45:53 Ayyye I got you. A gentle cleanser (Cetaphil, Biore’s Baking Soda cleanser or Neogen green tea cleanser at Sephora), rose hip oil or vitamin E for moisture & to fade away dark spots, & lastly a heavy moisturizer at night. Exfoliate too gurl! Lastly clay masks 1-2x a week
8399 2018-03-12 02:45:45 @GerberKawasaki, will identify the supporters to the media and public and is also calling for a boycott of their businesses. He also says that "We will do everything to fight you destroying our state." #immigration #oil #guns #war #epa Trump is the devil.  RT #Resistance.

8401 2018-03-12 02:45:42 Seems to me any study ought to look at this from more than just corporate standpoint. I want to understand costs of lost or “spilled” consumer data on internet to society. I look at the negligence of equifax for example and immediately thought of Exxon Valdez spilling oil in AK.
8402 2018-03-12 02:45:32 $CEI does this follow anytype of gas index??? So far we got some good news about natural oil and the rest... And I hope this is the dip
8403 2018-03-12 02:45:28 Anointing oil should do the trick 
8404 2018-03-12 02:45:21 I sympathise. Trienza digestive enzymes, lots of bone broth with salt & hemp oil when I couldn’t eat and autoimmune paleo diet helped my gut symptoms. Not a cure but made my life easier.
8405 2018-03-12 02:45:15 emu oil is witchcraft and I luv it
8406 2018-03-12 02:45:10 while you and your pals wallow in longing for some kind of 1950's Utopia , that never existed , the glory days of BIG OIL , a white privilege male dominated society , we have a gov't preparing Canada for the real world , where the high tech and alternative energy future is here
8407 2018-03-12 02:45:09 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.
8408 2018-03-12 02:45:08 Just chop them up and cover in oil
8409 2018-03-12 02:44:44 I loooooove Neals Yard Remedies's Rose Oil :)
8410 2018-03-12 02:44:40 He's a snake oil sales"man", he only needs to imply to make a sale to a mark.
8411 2018-03-12 02:44:38 กะยืม800
8412 2018-03-12 02:44:25 Damn it 
Fun to watch. But how much damn oil you going to put on just looks like you have enough to fry chicken
8413 2018-03-12 02:44:13 I need an oil pen
8414 2018-03-12 02:44:06 tea tree oil works miracles 
8415 2018-03-12 02:44:05 Productive day! Clean car, oil change done, laundry almost done & even squeezed in some time for my nieces! 
8416 2018-03-12 02:43:56 These are great!  But you really put oil on your lens? Are you jus sayin that for the clout? Lol
8417 2018-03-12 02:43:44 Most Albertans are aware of the environmental risks of pipelines many are working  to make oil shipments as safe as possible because we know that all of Canada benefits from our oil so we are willing to take risks for your benefit
8418 2018-03-12 02:43:31 My old ess is ready to go polyfest on Saturday! that pine and oil smell around the Tongan stage  COME AT ME  YYYAAAASSSS

8420 2018-03-12 02:43:07 nila love this yea but we are scared to give her this as u said oil and processing there might be different from what we get here. no?
8421 2018-03-12 02:43:02 y’all think it’s highlight but it’s oil
8422 2018-03-12 02:42:57 Dictator . Snake oil salesman. Sham.

8426 2018-03-12 02:42:42 Tea tree oil better rescue them pimples :')
8427 2018-03-12 02:42:40 Eh Mb saya nggak bermaksud menghina orang-orang yang memilih pakai baby oil lho.

Kalo emang niatnya buat ngasih kesan innocent atau buat nginget masa-masa waktu masih malu-malu kucing, ya emang logisnya pake baby oil. Kalo lagi mau session yang creamy-aromatic, ya pake Vaseline.
8428 2018-03-12 02:42:39 i LOVE both of those and rosehip oil too (:
8429 2018-03-12 02:42:28 Oh my absolute fuck I required crude oil
8430 2018-03-12 02:42:21 ถามจริง ยืมตังหน่อย
8431 2018-03-12 02:42:15 ชั่วโมงสุดท้าย คือ เทรนกันสุดชีวิตอ่ะ คะแนนพุ่งมากกกอ่ะ
8432 2018-03-12 02:42:12 it's Nila's favorite but we were bit worried abt oil there and preparation there :O
8433 2018-03-12 02:42:08 UN imposed the Sanctions on Oil and Petroleum products . That's what is hurting most .
8434 2018-03-12 02:42:03 Explain to me why he was never suspended for drug use. VJ suspended for fish oil. All about money and ratings.
8435 2018-03-12 02:41:55 Even if is weed oil I gonna smoke ?
8436 2018-03-12 02:41:42 US Producers are Just getting started Mr. Oil Min!!!!  : ]  So figure something out & do it
8437 2018-03-12 02:41:40 Impeachment is a criminal proceeding. To remove Pence will take a civil remedy, as in elections.  The Good news is that Pence was on Trump's Campaign and transition team and is likely hip deep in Russian Oil with Trump.
8438 2018-03-12 02:41:39 I use micellar water or jojoba oil on cotton rounds 
8439 2018-03-12 02:41:31 Somebody come oil my scalp and massage my head  or just play in my hair.

8441 2018-03-12 02:41:15 I'm combo oily/normal, but I really liked the Maracuja oil from Tarte! Worked really well with a few drops mixed into my night cream
8442 2018-03-12 02:41:10 Have totally done this in the past too. Straight up baby oil (w/out the extras like vitamin e etc) is excellent. I stopped cos I cbf doing a second cleanse to get rid of residue if I was feeling lazy. 
8443 2018-03-12 02:41:02 Oil change & getting my screen fixed tm
8444 2018-03-12 02:40:58 My partner in our dept resigned. I left alone with my manager. Dalawa nalang kami, and I am not feeling well. Gusto ko na umuwi. Feeling ko magiging dysfuctional and unproductive ako today. Inaalala ko pa pati yung mga kahon ko ng olive oil. Ano na? Puñeta what to dooooo
8445 2018-03-12 02:40:45 If it was up to me, would’ve had a hot pan of olive oil and some cornmeal
8446 2018-03-12 02:40:28 マテウスーマテウスー飲みにいこーぜー
8447 2018-03-12 02:40:22 I wish there was a way I could olive oil in a little container and take it everywhere bc that’s fucking magic on my lips
8448 2018-03-12 02:40:17 My pillows smell like beard oil
8449 2018-03-12 02:40:12 いや…ちょ、やめろっ！耳からはさすがに油飲めないから！
8450 2018-03-12 02:39:26 I’m a notorious sleeper in make upperer but macs cleansing oil has honestly been one of the best I’ve used
8451 2018-03-12 02:39:25 #NP Neil And Adam @neiladammusic - Oil Fire on @official365rn
8452 2018-03-12 02:39:16 Antes querías tener dinero pronto y te enrolabas en el medio energético (Oil Gas) ahora hay que dedicarse a la política $$$
8453 2018-03-12 02:39:12 反応しなくてアイチュウくんできないしもう時間が無い……
8454 2018-03-12 02:39:10 Why underestimate size of an ANTI-pipeline demonstration? C’mon media, if you want trust get this right...the expectation is-nothing less than accurate reporting on a very important moment in Canada’s history...citizens rejecting big oil status quo.
8455 2018-03-12 02:39:06 One of them slicked his fingers in oil and shoved them up Alvo’s ass.
8456 2018-03-12 02:39:05 Hi, I need skin oil recommendations if y’all have any 
8457 2018-03-12 02:39:01 *Put more oil on the kart* Heh HEH heh #Dingobot
8458 2018-03-12 02:38:38 Check out oil cleansing method for info and sometimes type of oil is super important depending on your skin type :)
8459 2018-03-12 02:38:08 Just drink water & change ur sheets also i only use coconut oil it’s all you need
8460 2018-03-12 02:38:02 Addicted to body oil and whitening strips
8461 2018-03-12 02:37:56 There’s a very specific way to use it when you first start out. Comes with instructions and everything. Cleanser > treatment > moisturizer. But I only use moisturizer in the day. In the night I use jojoba oil. Then after using regimen for like a month I started using the AHA+ too
8462 2018-03-12 02:37:46 <living bottle of olive oil
8463 2018-03-12 02:37:44 And the opening of sacred lands in the south west United States to mining and oil exploration is ok according to the trump administration. At least Chile’s vandalizing wasn’t Government supported .
8464 2018-03-12 02:37:23 bro i take over 1200mg of ibuprofen n that shit still doesn't relieve the pain...... smoking weed n oil help w anxiety but not the pain really..
8465 2018-03-12 02:37:21 I used to use a home made oil mix by @WasianFactor. She said it’s part almond, jojoba and grapeseed. Use that with a cotton ball & rinse.
8466 2018-03-12 02:37:14 < actually saya sendiri lebih milih ini dibanding b*o oil >
8467 2018-03-12 02:37:00 ชีวิตดีว่ะ5555556 ยืมตังหน่อย//จริงจัง
8468 2018-03-12 02:36:47 It was a fun 8 years of the oil companies keeping gas prices either artificially high or low depending on what conservative pundits needed to talk about on talk shows, not sure why they stopped bringing it up near the end of 2016...
8469 2018-03-12 02:36:41 I will preface this with the fact I do not have an ideal setup. Typical gameplan is room temp steak pat-dry with cracked sea salt/peppercorn blend for seasoning, high temp sear with EV olive oil/butter mix. With no SV options (right now) I try to continue cooking at lower heat.
8470 2018-03-12 02:36:40 My sister (v v sensitive skin) uses olive oil and a witch hazel solution for the same thing. It’s cheap as and very straightforward. We both have pretty oily skin - but this can be worked into a routine with your moisturiser of choice
8471 2018-03-12 02:36:31 On the plus side at least I got a oil change and got my car a tuneup
8472 2018-03-12 02:35:56 unpopular opinion: coconut oil eco style is trash
8473 2018-03-12 02:35:25 NVIDIA's Synthetic-Intelligence Tech Has Begun Conquering the Multitrillion-Greenback Oil and Gasoline Trade -- The Motley Idiot -
8474 2018-03-12 02:35:18 Mr.Harnarinder Singh, CEO of the Malaysian Palm Oil Certification Council (MPOCC) confirmed to be speaker of Asia Palm Oil Conference (APOC) 2018 @JuztalkThai #PalmOilConference
8475 2018-03-12 02:35:17 Previously: Trader Joe's Nourish Face Lotion mixed with a few drops of argon oil, also from Trader Joe's. Worked well for me.
Currently: Splurged on the Imperialis lotion from Lush and like it very much.
8476 2018-03-12 02:35:07 Sessions is trying to take away my CBD oil and cannibis from the dispensaries here in Nevada, he needs to stick to Federal issues and leave the states alone, or amend the Constitution like they did during failed prohibition.
8477 2018-03-12 02:34:51 i can’t stand when IG makeup brands aren’t upfront about their ingredients. just tried to look up a facial oil and the ingredient list is non existent on their own website & cosdna. emailed them to find out. we’ll see how they react to it lol
8478 2018-03-12 02:34:50 tbh, I just use oil (like, straight up baby oil) on a cotton ball to take my makeup off, it dissolves absolutely anything, and then use a flannel with warm water and a gentle facial cleanser to get rid of the residue (sometimes just water because I’m lazy)
8479 2018-03-12 02:34:49 Just ordered another essential oil and some milk bath combined with Shea butter  so excited for it to come
8480 2018-03-12 02:34:48 So if Alberta shuts down petroleum exports to BC how are these people getting to marches when it’s 30 bucks a liter to fill their minivans? Or no fuel for the ferries, cargo and cruise ships? Despite their beliefs BC needs AB Oil
8481 2018-03-12 02:34:37 and cheating his contractors, cheating taxpayers (w/bankruptcies), cheating on his wife and son, cheating the environment (placing Big Oil at the helm), cheating ppl out of healthcare,cheating students out of a fair education (Elitist Betsy DeVos), and on and on
8482 2018-03-12 02:34:27 ordered an essential oil diffuser and am genuinely excited for it to come
8483 2018-03-12 02:34:19 I deal with other health crud but I have been using CBD oil regularly. I hope it helps you too 
8484 2018-03-12 02:34:18 US oil export surges,spelling further troubles for Saudi Aramco’s IPO at lofty valuations
8485 2018-03-12 02:34:18 It was MOSTLY vegetarian, with some meats here and there. Fish is good as it contains Fish Oil, what is good for Inflammation, and good protein and you don't have to have it everyday. I would start each day for about 4 years or more, with a 4cup yogurt smoothie with Raspberries..
8486 2018-03-12 02:33:55 And he alone has won more trophies in 20 years than your squad has since they were conceived. I mean their original conceivement as a shit club. Not their 2008 creation as a dirty oil money club with zero history and plastic fans.
8487 2018-03-12 02:33:43 #EMWellnessWeek
Day off, R&R to the max:
- Slept until noon
- Worked on some projects, checked off some to-dos (Checked the oil in my car!)

- Cooked dinner and baked
8488 2018-03-12 02:33:26 Californians: "Oh, I don't drink caffeine, I just dab a bit of peppermint oil under my nose when I start to feel fatigued"

East Coasters: "mmmmm cofy"
8489 2018-03-12 02:33:25 John and ethics is like oil and water. They just don’t go together.
8490 2018-03-12 02:33:25 How come you fucks never told me about CBD oil for this tight ass guitar shoulder man come on
8491 2018-03-12 02:33:23 Oh, and be sure not to use unrefined peanut oil - it's a little obscure but apparently you can get it and it smokes way too soon; you want it really hot before you pour it on the stuff.
8492 2018-03-12 02:33:06 眠くなる成分が入った薬を飲んで、それを口実に１日寝てたい。
8493 2018-03-12 02:32:56 Do y'all ever just 
"Heat the olive oil in a small, non-stick pan over medium heat. Crack the eggdirectly into the pan and season generously with salt and pepper. Cookfor about two minutes, then use a spatula to flip the egg, being careful not to break the yolk." ?
8494 2018-03-12 02:32:54 Plan: <50 carbs/day
<2000-2500 calories/day

Slightly increasing exercise 

Also, resuming taking MCT/omega3 oil with meals. 

Not changing what I eat, just how much

Let's see how this goes
8495 2018-03-12 02:32:25 H: I hate loops and artificial intelligence. I think too many screws and metals will never replace human feeling. But an amalgamation between the two could be interesting to see. a Cyborg that cries good quality oil.
psychoanalyst: OMG. 
H:  maybe you meant OMSF
psychoanalyst: ?
8496 2018-03-12 02:32:23 putting a drop of coconut oil in my dried up eyebrow pomade was so smart of me i didn’t even google it

8501 2018-03-12 02:31:00 What about subsidies for oil/coal companies too?
8502 2018-03-12 02:31:00 What happened when Sir Alex kicked Beckham in head that's tight f all what happened when King Cantona  kicked a fan did Man u sack him. Check your self
8503 2018-03-12 02:30:58 Dear zealot:  TMP is the only pipeline in NA that carries both refined product and crude oil in batches. NOT TAR.

Tar is liquid distilled from wood or coal, consisting of a mixture of hydrocarbons, resins, alcohols, & other compounds. NOT crude.

Go huff that "clean" air. #Loser
8504 2018-03-12 02:30:46 Holy crap, Rufus. I think that's the first time I've seen an oil lamp be used as a weapon. #Timeless
8505 2018-03-12 02:30:36 I sweated my hair out last night and I’m salty, but hopefully with me wrapping it tightly and adding oil to it will make it look ok lol
8506 2018-03-12 02:30:16 March 11, 2018 at 10:30PM Waiting for #Ecuador to admit Petroecuador oil spills

8508 2018-03-12 02:30:14 Is he referring to the oil industry?
8509 2018-03-12 02:30:11 OIL DIFF: 3.6 -> 3.64
8510 2018-03-12 02:30:09 I WAS GETTING SOMETHING OUTTA THE CUPBOARD AND A FULL GALLON OF COOKING OIL FELL ON MY HEAD BOUNCED OFF AND HIT MY BOOB IM ACTUALLY DYING

8512 2018-03-12 02:29:50 Nothing says annoyance like trying to put two large chicken breasts in the air fryer with olive oil and salt and pepper, and realizing they don't fit because they're still frozen. #airfryer
8513 2018-03-12 02:29:43 I wish you lived in a mmj state too! Without the lotions, balms, and infused coconut oil I make, I would require stronger medications. I would never get out of bed. We need safe access to all modalities that keep us alive. We all deserve a life worth living. #cannabis

8521 2018-03-12 02:28:38 Which you clearly have no clue about. Georgia ordered killing russian passport holders. The government Donbas and Crimea voted into kiev was overthrown in blood. And Assad denied the US an oil pipeline that would lessen Europe’s dependency on Russian gas. You’re not informed.
8522 2018-03-12 02:28:17 ALL serious. Barbecued broccoli is  amazing. Cut into larger sections. Salt and pepper, with help from olive oil. 

Watch the florets, they cook fastest and can be bitter if they are too charred.

8524 2018-03-12 02:27:59 Tar sands (also referred to as oil sands) are a combination of clay, sand, water, and bitumen, a heavy black viscous oil. Tar sands can be mined and processed to extract the oil-rich bitumen, which is then refined into oil.
8525 2018-03-12 02:27:53 it's alright i started using castor oil to grow my eyebrows out and working out so i can wear cute clothes 
8526 2018-03-12 02:27:50 And tore those cuticles UP! My goodness. You can use hair conditioner to massage them and soak in warm water. It’ll heal them in addition to cuticle or olive oil.
8527 2018-03-12 02:27:49 Who wants to get married and help me rub coconut oil in my hair while I cook enchiladas? Who wants to be in LOVE man?
8528 2018-03-12 02:27:45 i drenched my finger in coconut oil hopping it would slide off, but it took me and my mom like 20 mins to take it off LOL my finger was swollen for like 3 hours after that
8529 2018-03-12 02:27:44 No wonder Alberta is banning BC wines ..they didn’t even make the list..why trade high grade oil for low grade wine

8531 2018-03-12 02:27:36 the exception to my little rule is that the shop near me sells all sorts of infusions, though, and you bet your ass I fry my onions in harissa-infused olive oil, or parmesan-rosemary-garlic oil, or whatever.

8538 2018-03-12 02:26:28 If Big Oil went down for 3 days whilst the northern hemisphere endured winter, the green energy scam would be dead, as it would be seen for the scam it really is. Just look what happened in UK last week. Ur precious green energy failed and ppl died in droves from cold.
8539 2018-03-12 02:26:26 On the other hand, Saudi Inc does not belive crude oil prices will go higher in the near term... long term #OPEC+ may stop to exists with Russia pulling out at the end of 2018...

8543 2018-03-12 02:25:47 yeah, dirt cheap olive oil is awesome for basic-ass frying or for the binding part of a marinade (I almost never use my 20-dollar bottle for really basic stuff) but, like, using cheap stuff to make spaghetti aglio e olio is an exercise in greasy, greasy sorrow.
8544 2018-03-12 02:25:38 Yes, yes it is. Use a dictionary. I am talking about an oil spill in BC. I am not funded by Koch or anybody like you are. I am a BC citizen who doesn’t want our environment to be a shithole like you have made out of Alberta. Now I’m off to breathe clean air by my clean seaside.

8552 2018-03-12 02:24:28 The idea of using oil to wash my face used to have me so perplexed, like “how? Why?” But it’s been the best thing that’s ever happened to my skin.

He shut down oil from coming to North Korea. Trade is almost extinct with them. Trumps tactics is to hit them hard till they beg for mercy!
8572 2018-03-12 02:21:27 The Hummus Sandwich was great after I added some olive oil, lemon juice & garlic to it.

The avocado sandwich was a bit bland because I didn‘t add enough lemon juice & salt to it also more cayenne pepper would have helped.

8580 2018-03-12 02:20:58 They are not even white half the time just rich fags that need a ass beating like joe dirt in the oil fields lol
8581 2018-03-12 02:20:57 I understand that. If olive oil is going to be a central taste in the dish, though, you really don't wanna cheap out (esp. since it turns out a lot of cheaper brands [and some more expensive ones] aren't even olive oil, whoops)
8582 2018-03-12 02:20:45 As well as their 2 biggest GDP producers r oil exports & remittances from the illegal aliens. As we produce more less money sent for oil. The more we can deport & stop working less remittances. There paid for!

8587 2018-03-12 02:19:32 Nope ... oil demand still increasing every year.  2mmbpd increase in 2018 is expected.  2017 increased by 1.8mmbpd.  We also have to replace over 8mmbpd that is lost to well production declines every year.  But I'm sure you will feel free to fabricate another narrative

8596 2018-03-12 02:18:34 Coconut oil
8597 2018-03-12 02:18:31 Oh sure, you know the chaotic terrifying beauty of like, a slick of oil before it catches fire or a giant crashing wave? Like that but with more underlying nightmares. And a sense of wonder less tainted by facing my own mortality!

8608 2018-03-12 02:17:04 I like it because it gives my lips a my lips but better look. It's very hydrating and feels great on the lips. I do think that I did find a new balm from Stila (balm lipstick) that has peppermint oil that I love. It is less expensive and more pigmented.
8609 2018-03-12 02:17:02 Now I will tell you about yesterday! Saturday was a GOOD and fulfilling day! Me and my dad (Barry Henry) worked on my truck, changing the oil and oil filter and getting it running again. Also, me and my dad went and saw @DeathWishMovie and had a good time. And my guy…
8610 2018-03-12 02:16:57 oh crap, I've been reading oil filter all this time, just realizing you said air filter. You can try Sheldon's on Molynes road for the filter.
8611 2018-03-12 02:16:51 My mom worked in the oil field industry. There was no way her taking clients to lunch could compete with her male counterparts taking them to the strip club. Poor Doris. #LoverComeBack #TCMParty
8612 2018-03-12 02:16:44 So appreciative of that thread on oily skin because mine is always a struggle. Luckily, I don't breakout too often, but my face always looks as if it's covered in baby oil at the end of the day.
8613 2018-03-12 02:16:43 @dannygkey When we love righteousness and hate sin,Our Heavenly Father will anoint us with the oil of gladness above those we fellowship with.
8614 2018-03-12 02:16:10 Wait, yes, and no.  It’s like oil companies pushing down renewable energy methods to stay at the top, the difference being no one has come even close to finding a good replacement for guns when it comes to the defense of personal property and self.

8627 2018-03-12 02:13:40 Typical response. Good at forking out the BS but don't like getting burdened down with facts. Every one of them is a hypocrite because they all use oil and gas in some capacity.

8631 2018-03-12 02:13:04 Announcement that Saudi Arabia is in initial phase of developing a nuclear weapon, followed by Iran withdrawing from agreement to pursue nuclear weapons, triggering an arms race in the Middle East and threatening oil shipments.
8632 2018-03-12 02:13:00 ye it should be. Interesting, did not even know it had a service light. The sticky thing is now that its gonna be hard to change the filter seeing that the engine is full of oil

8660 2018-03-12 02:08:00 Thank you!  I only knew him by his poster art/drawings (which I like), but didn’t know about his oil paintings that you showed here... looks really awesome!
8661 2018-03-12 02:07:59 Awesome to hear! #Hemp has a ton of uses. Some of the laws about hemp are a little confusing. For instance, does the state of WI treat #CBD oil from hemp differently from CBD oil from MJ?
8662 2018-03-12 02:07:53 the media have been FIXING oil prices
8663 2018-03-12 02:07:33 Mexican Dads will Plant avocado trees for you, change your engine oil and ask you if you need anything from Sams.
8664 2018-03-12 02:07:13 Cheese in a tortilla is not Spanish thing. Eggs, potatoes, good olive oil, salt. Add onion and smoked paprika for more flavor. Cheese muddies the flavors.
8665 2018-03-12 02:07:07 So true!! I’m back working in the oil and gas industry making more money than I ever did. Unlimited overtime great benefits so excited. Thank you President Trump!

8669 2018-03-12 02:06:46 Ziyah JUST started growing mad hair ... I've been using Almond oil in her hair lol 
8670 2018-03-12 02:06:36 Honestly is me cooking. Screw olive oil. Butter and Manteca are the only way to go for flavor!
8671 2018-03-12 02:06:31 “put this baby oil on your titties and slap this body glitter on your coochie.. trust me im a photographer, you fuckin w. the vision or not? cuz i can find someone else”
8672 2018-03-12 02:06:21 Some people like to refer to me as a "troll" which... whatever. Maybe my definition of "troll" is different than others. Sure, I'll occasionally go trolling (who doesn't?), but its not like I go outta my way to @ Oil fans I don't follow to chirp them...
8673 2018-03-12 02:06:16 @gcaldwell82 
A: If you aren't smart enough to know there isn't any "tar" involved, it speaks volumes.
B: That is your alternative to oil. And it is as destructive - or worse.
C: That current TMP has been operating fine since 1953.
D: You are fucking up Cdn grain rail movement.
8674 2018-03-12 02:06:16 Except it will do the opposite. Instead of tankers with rescue tugs and local pilots there will be US tankers with no special precautions. Meanwhile the remainder will be oil-by-rail running in valleys next to our rivers. Both pose a much higher risk to the environment.
8675 2018-03-12 02:06:12 Since I’ve started making Korean food, there is not an article of clothing I own that hasn’t been stained by bright red chili oil.
8676 2018-03-12 02:05:49 Dick, Oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly Oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off Buildings. Pls tell @vancouverpride how u rationalize obstructing  Gay friendly Oil while enriching Gay killing oil @VictoriaPride
8677 2018-03-12 02:05:37 Needless to say I’m grateful for hector and his dad. Because if they ever see my tank almost empty or my oil needing to be changed they do it without hesistation & without me having to ask. And I will say I’m not ungrateful for them or that. Because I always thank them.

8679 2018-03-12 02:05:21 Sauce has other properties. This is like putting an olive in a pan and saying “there, now you have cooking oil”.
8680 2018-03-12 02:04:55 I so appreciate that @diddy's beard and hair are shining like diamonds. I wonder what kind of oil that is... #iHeartRadioMusicAwards
8681 2018-03-12 02:04:52 Absolutely.  Husband worked in the oil field, post Piper Alpha, and had to take regular Helicopter Underwater Escape Training (HUET) every 2 years.  (There are YouTube videos, it's unpleasant at best)
8682 2018-03-12 02:04:50 I'd like Ben to name one heavy oil producing jurisdiction that is trying to de-carbonize its crude oil like Alberta is. Why, oh why, would be kill oil production in the one place that takes climate change seriously? Protest Nigeria if "dirty oil" is such a big issue.
8683 2018-03-12 02:04:41 In all honesty, when it comes to what McDavid ultimately does, the supporting cast is just window dressing. The surrounding pieces will help him pile up more points but he'll be spectacular regardless of who he plays with.

8689 2018-03-12 02:03:20 I just ordered vitamin e oil and a rotating rabbit vibrator lol life is good
8690 2018-03-12 02:03:05 Supply-side environmentalism (protesting pipelines, etc) doesn't work. Coal power gen is going to decline b/c natgas + renewables + battery storage is better and cheaper. The only way to displace oil is electric vehicles...and those are a long way off. A looooooong way.
8691 2018-03-12 02:02:58 Does castor oil on brows/lashes actually work??
8692 2018-03-12 02:02:53 So where were they when Pew grandfather first invested in oil sands as Sun oil later Sunaco and later sold becoming Suncor ? Made billions off oil in US and Canada now fund activists to protest oil amongst other things. Hypocrites

8702 2018-03-12 02:01:32 Very few people want to drill exploratory wells for oil or (even worse) nat gas in Bears' Ears. The US has more than enough proven oil and gas locations and prices do not incent exploration. Not saying this wasn't a motivation, but if it was, it was stupid.
8703 2018-03-12 02:01:29 Pure coconut oil on infants hair is the best
8704 2018-03-12 02:01:26 My personal method involves a barbecue grill and open flame - cook off the bad, scour, then re flame the oil into it, outdoors to avoid the smell. 6-7 hours

8719 2018-03-12 01:59:32 International oil co.s prefer to ship AB dilbit & upgraded oil to their existing refineries elsewhere. If upgrading is worthwhile and private business won't do it, there is the public alternative. BC Hydro was formed for that reason and successful over 40 years. #abpoli #cdnpoli
8720 2018-03-12 01:59:26 My skin has been peeling like crazy for the last 2 weeks & I just remember I sprayed Maria’s tanning oil on me by accident, because I thought it was sun screen... 
8721 2018-03-12 01:59:12 It's becoming somewhat obvious the US gave all areas east of Euphrates controlled by their allies Kurds to Turkey, in exchange for Turkey not meddling with US-Kurdish control of areas west of the river where all oil fields are! With Kurdish betrayal Syria maybe lost those areas.
8722 2018-03-12 01:58:56 I really like Dr. Jart’s ceramidin body oil. If you put it on after you towel off and your skin is still a bit moist, when your skin dries its soft and supple. I just wish the oil was a *teeeny* bit thicker. Its like a step away from water.

8750 2018-03-12 01:53:29 We need to look to transition off of FF yes, but we must also be realistic. Crude oil is not going anywhere anytime soon and trying to stop a project such as TMP thinking that it will somehow help the global fight against climate change is foolish.

8755 2018-03-12 01:52:18 Today was my first taking CBD oil orally. My research says it helps with anxiety, schizophrenia, and pain reduction. It makes you a little tired so I think it’s best used before bed. It’s suppose to activate the cannabinoid receptors that are already in your brain and body.  
8756 2018-03-12 01:51:30 Oil will be transported one way or another. Your options are rail and pipeline. The consequences of insufficient pipeline capacity are already being felt in other industries such as agriculture where grain is being put on the backburner in favour of oil.

8765 2018-03-12 01:49:20 Pipelines are the safest way to transport oil. Leaks are not devastating and can be fairly easily cleaned up.

8769 2018-03-12 01:48:50 That’s where I get confused. They get paid to move the product, not sell it. So price shouldn’t matter as long as oil is flowing?
8770 2018-03-12 01:48:17 I actually used to work in oil and gas. Most fracking is in surrounding counties, not much in ours. I’m in Somerset County, where Trump keeps bragging about mines opening. Our streams are just now getting better, my kids will watch them decline again.

8793 2018-03-12 01:44:54 Not sure if I had no responsibilities . Oil is a hell of a feather. Oh well, kinda nice.
8794 2018-03-12 01:44:37 All they need to do is confiscate all the buildings they own from them. Declare them terrorists. Declare them as attempting to overthrow the country, which they are: Islam, sharia, Jihad. Oil? We have oil. Not as much but we have oil around our seas.

8797 2018-03-12 01:44:29 Rub with olive oil. Use a potato nail - 400 degrees - 40 min - flip - 30 min. 

They're a tad overdone. Super soft and super sweet.
8798 2018-03-12 01:44:09 Two days before general elections in Grenada, incumbent PM Kieth Mitchell announces the discovery of oil and announces the prospect of Grenada being a major producer of oil and gas. 
Will gov't control the process, seek regional partnerships among CARICOM or foreign companies?
8799 2018-03-12 01:43:51 I could literally bathe in lavender oil. It smells so good
8800 2018-03-12 01:43:49 Mechanic had to Jack mine up and use an all in key to change my oil and I am yet to find a air filter for my SkyActiv.

8803 2018-03-12 01:43:20 I'm not 1 to argue either. It's unproductive & wasteful. Natural spunk lube is condom safe, just not with latex condoms. // The 2 oil & only ingredients are organic avocado oil & organic coconut oil. Not processed or petroleum or "bad oils". Hello ;)

8805 2018-03-12 01:43:12 Best thing that Alberta can do is cutoff oil supply and have all these worthless pieces of shit ride bikes all day.
8806 2018-03-12 01:42:53 Or an oil rig...
8807 2018-03-12 01:42:50 Grenada  rich we found oil
8808 2018-03-12 01:42:41 Not to mention eating food transported by truck, taking medicines derived from oil, staying in hotels built with the energy from oil and using toilets who’s infrastructure was put in place with the use if oil. The hypocrisy runs deep on the west coast
8809 2018-03-12 01:42:39 Ha ha ha, so says the thug. I don't understand what is so insulting in frying pakodas for a living or even as a business plan. This white uniformed liar is shamelessly trying to fry fishes without oil. We from Karnataka are sufficiently intelligent to know sense from nonsense
8810 2018-03-12 01:42:33 #makeup wipes are TRASH! I don't care how expensive or inexpensive. Coconut oil for the win!!
8811 2018-03-12 01:42:15 That’s a dope technique if you want to spend twenty bucks and have your kitchen smell like burnt oil for a month
8812 2018-03-12 01:42:10 What kind of oil y’all use for your hot oil treatments??
8813 2018-03-12 01:42:09 Exactly. The first person that tells me Climate change. I'm. I'm. Bought heating oil for March. 2.699 per gallon. Probably another 100 gallons in April. These left wing nut jobs that we the Tax Payer and or dumb arses pay I.E. Gore pay for can kiss my this
8814 2018-03-12 01:42:06 And senate. The CBD oil was moved and will pass but the other bill doesn’t have to go through the approval process. What the hell is that.
8815 2018-03-12 01:41:52 Methinks you're better in sprints than in midgets.
8816 2018-03-12 01:41:43 Oh I just remembered the thing that made me shriek. I was playing atdd and the lantern ran out of oil and I was freaked out running around and a minute later I was about to use a key

And I found THREE containers of oil, in my inventory
8817 2018-03-12 01:41:41 What does going to work have to do with dilbit shipments and dirty oil?
8818 2018-03-12 01:41:38 As far as #Assad, #hezbollah and #Russia are concerned, they have no problem exterminating and exiling the entire population from #Syria and that's what they plan to accomplish. Russian #energy #oil & #NaturalGas mob + hezbollah/Qods are the new co-owners of Syria
8819 2018-03-12 01:41:36 #Pressurewasher Tips: Always check the oil and gas levels on a gas power washer. Only use unleaded gasoline.
8820 2018-03-12 01:41:14 Soo...Grenada has found oil 
8821 2018-03-12 01:41:08 we need to teach him about the good natural oil's

8823 2018-03-12 01:40:55 I love this episode!! Light your oil lamps, @LoriLoughlin #hearties @hallmarkchannel @WCTH
8824 2018-03-12 01:40:53 always a great day when i'm reminded of the amazing atheist pouring hot oil on his balls and shoving a banana up his ass
8825 2018-03-12 01:40:41 Can you talk, then, about Alberta's oil patch and pipelines? Because it's a relatively high GDP-per-person  sector, but not a high stable employment sector. The dream of mythical ongoing pipeline jobs fuels some weird politics.
8826 2018-03-12 01:40:40 We need oil. Pipelines help.

8828 2018-03-12 01:40:32 Appreciating my moment right now. I’m in bed with clean sheets and my @SajeWellness diffuser on w/lavender oil. My gym and work clothes are laid out and I have vegan lunches packed for tomorrow. 

Hello, Monday- I’m ready for ya.
8829 2018-03-12 01:40:26 Another oil company has a skunk problem down the road. Not to keen about scounting out skunk hidy-holes in the dark. Think I’ll wait till I get back from my little vacation.

8831 2018-03-12 01:40:10 Today I learned in Indiana HB1412 which was a bill for CBD oil to be legalized which has been gutted and is being turned into a gun bill for carrying in churches with no cost and no renewal for the license. Apparently a legal maneuver as the bill has been through both the House
8832 2018-03-12 01:40:08 Yeah! I said sunflower seeds but in hindsight, perhaps sesame oil... in either case, oily and nutty in a really weird way

8836 2018-03-12 01:39:34 Damn @traybills why y'all do @chrismfngilly like that y'all put oil on they floor and started ratatagging him lol hitting him w/ the belt 
8837 2018-03-12 01:39:28 I guess it would have to be the #Alberta #Government that would have to finance a #refinerey that would refine the #tarsands #oil? Maybe #BC and the other provinces could chip in along with #Trudeau? #ABpoli #BCpoli #ONpoli #cdnpoli

8840 2018-03-12 01:39:14 So u mean oil, is made of dead plants and animals.. so we be driving dead plants and animals everywhere lmao . Fun
8841 2018-03-12 01:38:55 I don't understand how a town built on the pipeline, by oil money, and populated with pipeliners doesn't have a bar. How does that happen.

8846 2018-03-12 01:38:23 You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness;
Therefore God, Your God, has anointed You
With the oil of joy above Your fellows.
Psalm 45:7
8847 2018-03-12 01:38:11 Oil has been very important for decades and will continue be important. Natural resources of all kinds built this country and keep it prosperous!
8848 2018-03-12 01:38:05 It’s been 20 minutes since I put coconut oil on my cat’s toe pads & I’m pretty sure he’s still holding a grudge bc I was looking at his paw to see if it was still dry and I guess I looked too hard bc I didn’t even touch it he & pulled it away 
8849 2018-03-12 01:37:37 Trump is opening up off shore drilling and pushing coal so how can the U.S. stop drilling for oil? None if this adds up accept for s reason for us to pay more.
8850 2018-03-12 01:37:37 She can't even travel in her own country without armed security. She wants to talk about other countries? 
8851 2018-03-12 01:37:37 i need some baby oil !!!!!!!!!
8852 2018-03-12 01:37:31 He's a snake oil salesman. There's nothing to he gained by having him on.
8853 2018-03-12 01:37:18 Like I said, I think creating tons of pipelines is a long term bad idea but you need a solution to the problem. You also need proof oil spills always happen, it doesn’t in plenty of places in the world. Don’t bring emotion to an argument. Win it with facts.
8854 2018-03-12 01:37:09 I hope it’s just an adjustment thing that goes away soon. In the meantime, acne dots are a game-changer. Sucks the oil right out of those bastards.
8855 2018-03-12 01:37:06 取る時間あるかなー。
8856 2018-03-12 01:36:44 According to the @nytimes, Ghana is contending for the world's fastest-growing economy without considering the precariousness of the cocoa and oil sectors-What's going to happen when subsidies stop and rising inequality?
8857 2018-03-12 01:36:24 And your suggestion as to how we move oil around is...? You need an alternative which a better solution or else your argument is meaningless because it won’t solve anything. Your argument assumes governments care as well? Hmmm... and can you prove they always lead to spills?
8858 2018-03-12 01:36:22 So now I know why I'm a closet pinko - the pop culture elements that helped form my political views include: female scifi/fantasy writers, Midnight Oil, apocalyptic novels, Orwell and Bradbury, Star Trek, M*A*S*H, Yes Minister, Frontline, Hollow Men.

8860 2018-03-12 01:36:16 It’s Sunday night so that means face mask, bubble bath, and coconut oil to wash away this weekend’s sins.
8861 2018-03-12 01:36:16 Lol.  Oil companies never made a loss!  Eternal truth!
:-)
8862 2018-03-12 01:36:13 Not really. At least it's never happened to me. They get a bit white but I think that's just the oil coming out.
8863 2018-03-12 01:35:53 でも半分にして、くれるってノスケちゃん言ってたよw
8864 2018-03-12 01:35:43 I went to church, change my oil, clean my car (inside and out) I went shopping, and cook dinner. Now I’m taking a hot bath to end this beautiful Sunday. 
8865 2018-03-12 01:35:23 I think everyone needs an oil diffuser.. I’ve only had mine like a week and a half and I use it everyday
8866 2018-03-12 01:34:42 Taste and mouth feel reminded me of sesame oil.  Just a hint.
8867 2018-03-12 01:34:23 Typical strawman arguing. "Oil companies are altruistic," said no one ever.  The scientists I follow don't take a dime from them.
8868 2018-03-12 01:34:18 investing in an oil based moisturizer was the best thing i did for my face/skin care routine
8869 2018-03-12 01:34:13 手のひらでコロコロされてる気がしないでもないけども
8870 2018-03-12 01:34:03 Dw b we’ll be spending sauce like it’s oil 
8871 2018-03-12 01:34:00 Salt, pepper, olive oil and some balsamic vinegar, then roast. Yummy.
8872 2018-03-12 01:34:00 Your painting is so breathtaking. I love the textures. When in school I attempted oil painting but found it wasn't for me. When I started cross-stitching I found I could create in a different medium. I fell in love. The more the challenge the better. Thank you for your art. 
8873 2018-03-12 01:33:57 Oil show and now a shower special? You are spoiling us tonight @jesswestxxx 
8874 2018-03-12 01:33:54 Oil change done
8875 2018-03-12 01:33:54 A log time ago I read a company was exploring for oil and gas in the arctic and drilled down the middle of a 300ft tree.
8876 2018-03-12 01:33:51 I feel so good right now off this oil.
8877 2018-03-12 01:33:34 めっちゃイイ 凄く 昂りますね 私のモブおじさん魂が 正直興奮します

8879 2018-03-12 01:32:43 Been some amazing 'oil specials' on @BabestationTV recently but, to be honest, none will ever top @kerriecowan, the Queen of Oil. Sadly missed on the babe channels but still can't wait for what's to come in the future. #StillAFan

8882 2018-03-12 01:32:16 Don't assume that cauliflowers species...if a cauliflower wants to be buffalo we should just embrace it and start giving it buffalo sauce when it's just a sprout.
8883 2018-03-12 01:31:59 Hey, it's millennial o'clock on Sunday night, time for our collective avocado oil bath, everyone.
8884 2018-03-12 01:31:54 It was an unwelcome but perfect opportunity to put Cannabis oil to the test and, if it worked, to add to the body of growing evidence. Good decision. 
8885 2018-03-12 01:31:50 lotta girls wouldn't hug me back when my dad used to put that albas oil under my neck and rub in my head
8886 2018-03-12 01:31:29 Vegan comfort food? Sounds as believable as a soothing colonoscopy.

8889 2018-03-12 01:31:08 I don't trust black people that dont recognize the power of coconut oil
8890 2018-03-12 01:30:58 Ralph Klein was an alcoholic.He couldn't have failed no matter how incompetent he was because of the money flooding in to the province from oil revenues. We need to diversify - there is big $$$ in renewable energy! 
But you will get your wish - how do you like Jason Kenny.
8891 2018-03-12 01:30:53 Did that “deal” include the US military bombing Russians and Syrians every time they get too close to Omar oil fields ?
8892 2018-03-12 01:30:45 Although I just cooked with olive oil, full on eastern would be a lot

8895 2018-03-12 01:30:41 Depends a lot on how is the diet where you live or how much you can afford to. 
Omega 3 an 6 are always good too (olive oil, fish oil and so), also giving preference to complex carbohydrates like fruit, oat, whole bread and so. Then again can't say much about diets from outside
8896 2018-03-12 01:30:36 i can’t even be mad at the amazing atheist guy anymore, like the video of him pouring hot oil on his penis and testicles is enough
8897 2018-03-12 01:30:32 Lindsay,Oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly Oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off Buildings. Pls tell @vancouverpride how u rationalize obstructing  Gay friendly Oil while enriching Gay killing oil @VictoriaPride
8898 2018-03-12 01:30:32 sure sparky, he was a hero to the right wing uneducated white male who despise anything that appears different to them, and to the oil industry elites who care not for the environment. Times change and so can you. As for Rachel. she needs to stop pandering to the oil co.

8908 2018-03-12 01:28:58 I hear Ms. Davis so much now that the oil change man asked me if he could call me Ms. Davis and I laughed in his face then told him no.

8918 2018-03-12 01:27:34 Not sure it’s as simple as that. Alberta oil patch has had some rough years, many are not in a position to give up business (aka $$$).
8919 2018-03-12 01:27:32 My parents:  Have you been rotating your tires?
Me: Every time I get an oil change 
My parents: Give us the receipts.  We're taking your car and having a talk with them
Me: Ok (watch out Honda service, they are coming for you )

8926 2018-03-12 01:26:13 Yes, Putin routinely tells his people the US is ready to invade & take over their oil fields every election cycle.  My husband saw it when he was there.

8930 2018-03-12 01:25:58 Milkey,  World Oil consumption increases EVERY YEAR. Canada’s Gay friendly Oil at tidewater takes market share from dictator’s oil. We want to have the world buy Canada’s Gay friendly vs. Dictator oil?  Would you agree?

8943 2018-03-12 01:23:31 Hey @LifeIsStrange @SQUARE_ENIX_EU how come not all of the tracks were on the Before The Storm Limited Edition Soundtrack ?? Both Vinyl and CD ?? Quite curious on it. Stuff like Burning The Midnight Oil and Chemical Problem were great tracks !!
8944 2018-03-12 01:23:30 Eucalyptus and Tea Tree oil go soo good together... 
8945 2018-03-12 01:23:25 I wasn’t talking about the paid protestor fact. Can you say how all the anti oil folks got there.
8946 2018-03-12 01:23:22 I think you have that backwards, Rupert. How could exporting oil replace dictator oil? Surely the only way to replace imports would be to refine it ourselves (i.e., value added, Canadian jobs, etc.)
8947 2018-03-12 01:23:21 ** currently slathered in coconut oil **
8948 2018-03-12 01:23:04 She meant it generally and in comparison to how Oil displays affection towards FeFe - which they ultimately says he doesn’t.

8955 2018-03-12 01:22:12 Oil leak from a HGV? Or has the bridge fallen down?  @HighwaysEngland can you give us an update please?
8956 2018-03-12 01:22:05 Tcanova wrote how its a shame that the oil and gas industry is drilling, fracking in our national parks per the EPA headed up by Scott Pruitt, appointee of DJT our liar in chief, DJT.. NO its not a shame its CRIMINAL robbing our kids and grandkids of fresh water and air, nature.

Care about RENEWABLE ENERGY, NOT Coal Nor Oil! Take care of ALL OF OUR LAND THAT MAKES AMERICA WHAT IT IS! TAKE CARE OF YOUNG & OLD
8964 2018-03-12 01:20:34 rubbing shea butter and lemon essential oil into my face is all fun and games until i need to sleep and some of it transfers onto my pillowcase
8965 2018-03-12 01:20:32 If you eat enough of it, you won't be, nor will anyone around you.
8966 2018-03-12 01:20:24 The truth is holly looks like fried chicken that’s been in the oil for a minute too long! But compared to their other doggos Holly’s actually cute

8969 2018-03-12 01:20:10 Hi Ryan, .. we're just hearing from recovery contractors about another 30mins and lane in contra-flow should be clear.. the HGV lost air and leaked a lot of oil over the road surface.
8970 2018-03-12 01:20:08 @BrynneKKelly What do you think about Energy Transfer Partners (ETP)?
Oil production is supposed to be sky high and they’re the toll road that all that oil travels on. So why isn’t the stock higher?
Can’t just be debt level?
Thanks.
8971 2018-03-12 01:19:44 Try putting coconut oil every other night

8973 2018-03-12 01:19:25 I haven't baked bread for ages, but I have to say, I am so pleased. The crumb was light, the crust was crisp, & there was major olive oil action. I'd send some, but it would be hopelessly stale

8980 2018-03-12 01:18:07 might have something to do with Russia destroying their oil convoy. The US, BTW,  'ignored' this convoy, except the time we dropped leaflets telling them to get away from their trucks before we bombed them. (just for show, apparently)
8981 2018-03-12 01:18:05 After many years of opposing deployments of missile defence systems in Europe, Russia went ahead to produce a missile faster than any defence system. A multi billion dollar American business just rendered obsolete. Crude oil is fast becoming obsolete too and we are not ready.
8982 2018-03-12 01:17:32 Oooh thank you so much I will get it!! And I’ve actually just bought an oil based cleanser from the body shop so I’ll see how I get on with that xx

9000 2018-03-12 01:14:38 Hey Dan- how much CBD oil do you recommend daily? Thanks!
9001 2018-03-12 01:14:25 Oh dear, what did we do with that $22.7 billion? The state oil company hasn’t explained what it did with at least $22.7 billion earned from the sale of oil licenses and in dividends from its stake in Nigeria LNG Ltd. over a 15-year period.
9002 2018-03-12 01:14:10 So, I was brought up as a serious Evangelical/Pentecostal Christian. Meaning, church dancin', water dunkin', tongue talking, oil slingin', miracle believin', kind of serious, & I'm pretty sure I'm going to hell for laughing at this whole exchange!  I  Red SO MUCH!

9019 2018-03-12 01:11:51 Its such a pathetic argument. If you want to lose weight you don’t starve yourself to death, you eat less. Nobody is suggesting we get rid of oil. But when you have no argument it’s all about the “But planes and cars!”
9020 2018-03-12 01:11:43 The oil. I'm too slippery

9038 2018-03-12 01:09:01 was about 14 months old.

pro tip (wouldn't have saved your lasagna, though): cover pan in layer of foil before putting on food. also helps with cleanup, and you don't have to use oil, sprays, etc. I was able to save my cabbage thanks to this.
9039 2018-03-12 01:08:59 I'll read it. Desmond Tutu flew priv from Africa to Calgary, flew to Fort Mac then helicopter to fly over oil sands, landed and while being in the middle of the largest rainforest in the world lectured us we were destroying the enviro. Then he went back to Africa.

9046 2018-03-12 01:08:00 so if i use a humectant, say hyaluronic acid, should i apply an oil afterwards?
9047 2018-03-12 01:07:54 They built concrete buildings, mega churches, oil industries...taking space on the land where food was supposed to be grown and they built super casket(supermarket) to sell you fruits without seeds, gmo. The game is cold
9048 2018-03-12 01:07:44 Why don't they just say "breaded cauliflower" or "fried cauliflower?"  Why does it have to be fake wings? I use cauliflower as a substitute for mashed potatoes or rice, but I don't call it cauliflower "potatoes" or "rice".

9053 2018-03-12 01:06:50 By withdrawing people from said oil fields?
9054 2018-03-12 01:06:38 Vehicle bill-guns. 

From the piece: “Of the ten CBD legalization bills lawmakers introduced in January, SB 52 is THE bill that will cross the finish line intact, and in its current version, it will make CBD oil legal to buy, sell and possess in IN in the very near future.”
9055 2018-03-12 01:06:32 I got some tea tree oil on my lip and now I can’t feel my mouth
9056 2018-03-12 01:06:23 Insecurity brought on by a lack of faith in self and in Christ Jesus as Lord and Savior. Many of those very people pay lip service to faith in Christ, but when it comes down to it they only have an "oil film" faith, not the deep faith required by Christ!
9057 2018-03-12 01:06:19 The #YPG talk about defending #Syria’s borders while helping the US illegally invade and occupy Syrian oil fields in the east. The epitome of hypocrisy. #Afrin

9067 2018-03-12 01:05:36 The YPG did not call the US in just so they could occupy Syrian oil fields.

See, I’m not a fan of communist ideology but in the context of Nepal the oldest Democratic Party has turned into a brothel of corruption and wrong policies. People rejected Congress coz it can no longer deliver the goods. Oil have benefit of doubt.

9074 2018-03-12 01:04:05 Chris Russell is an archetypal blood and guts defenceman in the mood of Jason Smith, Lee Fogalin and Craig Muni. The Oil has often had this kind of warrior.......comes off the mid ce with blood dripping off his stick...love ‘em!

9077 2018-03-12 01:03:50 The Kurdish #YPG would rather help the US occupy #Syria’s oil fields than save their own people in #Afrin. Greed is an ugly thing.
9078 2018-03-12 01:03:48 Taxes are off the backs of the workers. Big Oil has been jamming it up our asses for a century, world wide. Time for renewable energy sources is now, evolve ffs.

9088 2018-03-12 01:02:14 Ugghhh that's bad.  But again HUET training might have saved someone.  Piper Alpha's legacy for the oil industry should probably be extended..

9097 2018-03-12 01:00:44 Love to have open tabs on the Maya civilization, various reefs in the Gulf of Mexico, ROV ocean research ships, Mississippian cultures, Apalachicola oyster beds, and Houston oil boom and not look at any of them and tweet instead

Hey Sydnee!  Big fan of the podcast and I love the humour and common sense you and Justin bring to the awesomely hilarious world of bizarro medicine!  Have you done or could you please do one on essential oils? This smelly oil cult has taken over too many friends.
9106 2018-03-12 00:59:50 Scandal free yes.......capital fleeing for other jurisdictions & govt still waiting on oil prices b/c they've done nothing to diversify.

9114 2018-03-12 00:58:33 Got an oil change today. Guy told me there’s a dent in my oil pan and asked if I had hit a pothole. I laughed in his face. AH POTHOLE?! BRUH I KNOW YOU DRIVE ON THESE STREETS. IT’S A MIRACLE MY CAR IS STILL IN MOTION.
9115 2018-03-12 00:58:11 took a shot of oregano oil
9116 2018-03-12 00:58:06 I got a cup full of that oil and I'm paid plus I'm sittin sideways
9117 2018-03-12 00:57:57 my whole house smells like patchouli oil and I’ve never been happier
9118 2018-03-12 00:57:52 Oil pastel?
9119 2018-03-12 00:57:38 This is absolutely a form of partisan buffoonery at the behest of Big Oil.
9120 2018-03-12 00:57:22 So so much!  That’s because the soul of creativity () is what unites all earthlings and what they do is the opposite of that. Wars, oil and gas, prisons, beheading gay people, GMOs, poison in the food and water, no healthcare, no education are all destructive, not creative.
9121 2018-03-12 00:57:19 I sip on that oil just to eased the pain
9122 2018-03-12 00:57:16 Every time I see y'all post pictures beautiful kids I think "I want one" and then I remember....

I was the nigga who drove around  with low power steering and oil levels for 2 months because "I didn't have the time or patience to get it done"

I'm not ready.
9123 2018-03-12 00:57:16 It's not just fish... miso soup tastes like used engine oil and I can't stomach it. Tofu seems to have a terrible texture..
9124 2018-03-12 00:56:56 Good, a delay is good for oil prices.  The speculation about the #Aramco IPO is bullish overall.  Plenty of time left for the [true] situation and state of the energy industry to expose itself before going public.
9125 2018-03-12 00:56:53 Midnight Oil, Place without a Postcard being played in class by our History Teacher, 10-1 just topped it off
9126 2018-03-12 00:56:33 Oh, I see...your wanton consumption of the oil you are protesting against is someone else's fault.  Got it.  You know you sound like an obese person lobbying fast food joints...WHILE eating a cheeseburger?

9129 2018-03-12 00:56:02 I would love to rub you down with that oil!
9130 2018-03-12 00:55:51 It’s my skin’s favorite oil by far
9131 2018-03-12 00:55:46 Is polyethylene the most common plastic, oil biproduct?

(I don’t fully understand the relationship but will look it up)
9132 2018-03-12 00:55:26 Don’t care about her per se.  Buying her silence 6 days before the election with an unreported campaign contribution I do care about.  (And of course the hypocrisy of the Clinton morality police etc)
9133 2018-03-12 00:55:22 Well darn, busted a coolant fitting on my MINI while changing the oil. Not something I can fix easily, so off to the shop it goes. Still committed to DIY though - learning every time (even if it gets expensive). 
9134 2018-03-12 00:55:22 for dry skin & eczema, try emu oil. I’ve always loved it and forgot I had it. My eczema was getting awful and I didn’t know what to do and remembered I had it. Been using it for 4 days and my skin isn’t suffering anymore.
9135 2018-03-12 00:55:13 And olive oil stains garments!  Blast, have you ever tried to get an olive oil stain out of a black wool?  Impossible!
9136 2018-03-12 00:55:13 if you get pigs, they find truffles and you make it into truffle oil!!

9140 2018-03-12 00:53:59 (2/2) enforced laws thus making them an extremely safe work environment. We need to realize that oil rigs are an absolute necessity to life and society as a whole, and we should actively try and  increase this type of business. #OilRigs4life
9141 2018-03-12 00:53:58 Since pipelines have been proven to be an unsafe mode of transport, we shouldn't be transporting oil. A pipeline spill is guaranteed to happen, it's just a matter of when. (Just like how a person shouldn't carry garbage around, dropping it all over the place)
9142 2018-03-12 00:53:55 Omg babes how even 
Take it easyy glad ur left hand didnt get burned too much. Oil burns kills so much  /huggu
9143 2018-03-12 00:53:49 No more than tax breaks for the extremely wealthy or profitable oil companies etc. is facism. Right?
9144 2018-03-12 00:53:44 Get a job instead of living off fathers oil money.
9145 2018-03-12 00:53:39 Just because oil companies don't INTEND for a spill to happen, it doesn't mean that those spills are a completely innocent mistake (just like how littering is littering, intentional or not)
9146 2018-03-12 00:53:32 I’m so frustrated why doesn’t every store sell palmers coconut oil fuuuck. I’m like about to cry that’s like the only thing I like to use on my hair.
9147 2018-03-12 00:53:29 (1/2) Offshore Oil Rigs has been an area of large debate for quite some time. Many individuals argue that rigs are beneficial to the economy, I 100% agree with this. Oil rigs pose minimal risk for  high reward. Unlike other businesses, oil rigs have their own set of heavily
9148 2018-03-12 00:53:10 Since you can't seem to understand what I'm saying, I'm gonna break it down for you. 

If the government cares about littering, it should care about oil spills which have devastating environmental repercussions.

9154 2018-03-12 00:51:53 Can I ask for your evidence for this claim? "Curry was bought by big oil"
9155 2018-03-12 00:51:38 Say the diesel and powered ferry May and many other greenies took to the rally. I'll assume you posted this using your oil based plastic phone or your oil based plastic pc? You'd rather see oil move by diesel powered train/truck? How much $$ did Tides donate to the rally?

9171 2018-03-12 00:49:19 So politicians are willing to spend billions on their own interests (perpetual warfare, oil, Wall Street) but say that spending billions on stuff that would help their own people (universal health care, student debt) is nothing but a pipe dream. Can't imagine why
9172 2018-03-12 00:49:07 I ain’t got no edges for real lmao I’m keep rocking this bob until my Jamaican castor oil starts to work

9175 2018-03-12 00:48:22 If you want an extra salty Cajun kick, highly recommend an olive oil/old bay seasoning combo.
9176 2018-03-12 00:48:13 No you are right @larryelder, there is no need for any consumer protection from companies that are a monopoly. No, they would never gouge us. Funny oil companies in the last 15 years made more tha in all history. I’d call that odd.

9221 2018-03-12 00:40:02 The world will never how sad I am 
My pain is water and oil that can't mix
So only above the surface of the water do I?
Breathe, and the interest towards me ends

9222 2018-03-12 00:39:54 How and what is an olbas oil inhaler?
9223 2018-03-12 00:39:52 The filling is just gross oil and sugar.
9224 2018-03-12 00:39:41 very true! Where do you usually get your oil changes?
9225 2018-03-12 00:39:28 Fox News Anchors know that when the President has a toddler tantrum, a sane person assumes he is winning #tiredofwinning
9226 2018-03-12 00:39:05 ชีวิตกูจะมีปัญหาอยู่เรื่องเดียวที่แก้ไม่ได้สักที ชีวิตนี้กูต้องมันอยู่ร่ำไปรึ
9227 2018-03-12 00:39:01 Come on @realDonaldTrump don’t let the oil companies and their puppet Senator (lying Ted) Cruz play you regarding the RFS and biofuels.
9228 2018-03-12 00:38:56 Uh, he wants their oil, not their weapons. Wow, she really is low IQ
9229 2018-03-12 00:38:08 My family were very into politics considering they were non-voters, but we cemented that interest with things like Midnight Oil, How Green Was My Cactus, Rubbery Figures, even M*A*S*H
9230 2018-03-12 00:38:03 RKO stands for I'm gonna purposely spill baby oil in your gear bag and then take a dump in it
9231 2018-03-12 00:37:52 tomorrow I'm gonna start with the appointments of the investigation and test runs with the weed oil dont know why I'm nervous af never been nervous before when testing something new but I really hope u & my closest friends r behind me and got my back while this runs for a year
9232 2018-03-12 00:37:36 Without the oil Norway would still be the laggard in Scandinavia. Petrostate referred in this instance to its reliance on oil for its current prosperity. Didn't have to do the harsh reforms the rest of the Nordics had to do.
9233 2018-03-12 00:37:31 If Union members think it thru they will support Trump. Strong stock market helps pension plan Oil & gas jobs Steel and coal jobs why go back to a slow drain of your wealth thru job & pension loses. Take it from a retired teamster seeing your earned pension fall away is no fun!
9234 2018-03-12 00:37:19 Maybe it's time for SK and AB to directly negotiate building a pipeline to the closest oil terminal accross the border, with Trump.

9239 2018-03-12 00:36:37 Civilians were mercilessly bombed by US Coalition acting illegally in Syria. ISIS made sure they took control of oil region, like they did in Ebril in Iraq. The government needed oil & had 2 buy it to keep the infrastructure going as EU/US sanctions deprived Syrians of supplies.
9240 2018-03-12 00:36:15 Swear primark sell bio oil for cheap or they used to
9241 2018-03-12 00:36:10 That did not happen. 

What actually happened was the SDF and Syrian Regime already had a pre-existng arrangement in Hasakah Province to share oil revenues between SDF & Regime.

In DeZ, one of Putin's Ogliarchy buddies made a deal to cut out SDF from the customary agreements.

9246 2018-03-12 00:35:29 I'm about to shower & then pull my oil pan... this isn't a smart move at all...
9247 2018-03-12 00:35:20 A couple of Canadians have died as a result of going from hospital to hospital and not finding a bed available. Not enuf drs. nurses & hospitals. Do you think our pop.

all invest in pipelines & oil.
9248 2018-03-12 00:35:19 You can oil
9249 2018-03-12 00:35:15 What oil did you use?
9250 2018-03-12 00:34:45 I need to decide if I want to find cheaper oil or something because hot crap
9251 2018-03-12 00:34:36 Sesame seed oil really does work wonders  and I found it in the kitchen cabinet!
9252 2018-03-12 00:34:21 You mean while they help the US occupy Syrian oil fields? How dare you say “protect borders” with a straight face.
9253 2018-03-12 00:33:58 Stupid is like water on oil, it always rises to the surface

9257 2018-03-12 00:33:33 I don't believe this for a second. How does the Dallas oil executive know that the DNA was from Cambiaso's "most-prized horse"?
9258 2018-03-12 00:33:18 I really wish coconut oil didn’t harass my pores the way it does 
9259 2018-03-12 00:33:10 Yes, but after our recent argument I am worried about making a suggestion you don’t like. *reaches for the olive oil*
9260 2018-03-12 00:32:24 If you want them to absorb straight into your bloodstream you should shoot them up with a hypodermic needle. Added benefit you don’t have to taste the oil
9261 2018-03-12 00:32:22 In the future petroleum companies stop lobbying in congress? I guess once oil runs out...?

9263 2018-03-12 00:31:50 Besides coconut oil whats another good oil for the body
9264 2018-03-12 00:31:41 Every bacterial infection I've ever had I've used Orgeano Oil, P D'Arco and Chapparal.

Those herbs are way less harsh on the body and the chances of side effects are extremely small.

Compare them with antibiotics. Google antibiotic + Candida/SIBO and see what antibiotics can do
9265 2018-03-12 00:31:20 They are fighting for power.
Power to do what?
-To control the resources i.e = Oil

9275 2018-03-12 00:29:28 In assessing the economic side, do you take into account that any Premiere of Alberta, no matter which party they came from, would have faced, like Notley, the  very beginning of a global oil glut, and the resulting long-term plunges in revenues? What would you have cut?
9276 2018-03-12 00:29:21 yeah and a little bit of motor oil

9279 2018-03-12 00:28:47 You mean remember how YPG sold Afrin for oil wells east of deir Ezzor.

9315 2018-03-12 00:23:37 I'd bet part of Trudeau's "negotiating" with Trump on taxes and tariffs includes keeping our oil in the ground and pipelines not getting built.

9331 2018-03-12 00:19:58 First, you as director of comm has not cared to present at least 6 months data. Answer that. Put it up in your reports on your website. Also respond to the proportion of oil/non-oil sector ratio as regards the reserve. Finally resign if that's too much for you.
9332 2018-03-12 00:19:54 The oil companies pump oil on federal land. The same oil companies are to pay the US Treasury royalties. Guess what the oil companies do.
9333 2018-03-12 00:19:53 More idiots like this one out there than you can imagine. Eco Terrorist have proven themselves the most destructive ( Gulf Oil Tragedy ).

9344 2018-03-12 00:16:55 Motor cycles run with oil. I call crap you are a prepper if you can not see the value of the bicycle.
The bicycle can use oils found in plants, tyres can be woven, metal can still be made.
But the almighty car will be rusted on the side of the road.

And America is game because they want someone who will play ball with them. Israel is already leasing oil from Syria to the US. It’s insanity.

9363 2018-03-12 00:13:59 OMG! I started simmering oranges, cloves and some tea tree oil. My eyes are better, my cough is better and no sneezing or at least half of what it had been. I need a diffuser ASAP. Oh & lavender essential oils to mask the tea tree.

9364 2018-03-12 00:13:58 Where do you pick all your stuff up at?! I do biotin and an oil mix but been tempted to use prenatal pills cause my hair won’t grow past the point it’s at rn
9365 2018-03-12 00:13:53 In good faith, without oil and healthcare Norway controls pretty close to the same amount of the economy as the US. Why argue for socialism when you could just argue for sovereign wealth funds, universal healthcare, welfare state, and labor and lose the socialism branding issues?
9366 2018-03-12 00:13:47 PMB is an illeterate but he has taken our external reserve to $46bn from around $26bn inherited from a PhD holder who sold oil for over $100 a barrel.
9367 2018-03-12 00:13:46 I just started using Avocado oil because my nose has been flaking because of the weather and it is a perfect! My nose is healing so much faster than just using my moisturizer
9368 2018-03-12 00:13:39 Tm i think I’m gonna go get a oil change & a car wash. Hopefully it don’t rain 
9369 2018-03-12 00:13:36 No,
The value of #gold is a false
$ price per barrel/oil
Calories per acre 
Production per man/hour
Are the gauge for production

9370 2018-03-12 00:13:34 @racingblogger Cheltenham preview is GOLD - brilliant insight! Not enough winners to pay the heating bills though? Is the painting in the background in watercolour or oil? Stunning.
9371 2018-03-12 00:13:20 Bio oil works a charm babe
9372 2018-03-12 00:13:17 Currently obsessed with jojoba oil rn tho, using it as a moisturizer and it’s made a big dif in my skin, makeup is sitting nicer

9374 2018-03-12 00:13:06 Clearly, that's the way the American Voters living in Ca want it
Considering
Ca's GDP is 10 times that of even big oil Texas 
Ca's probably the sixth largest economy on planet
& in 2018 Ca's funding surplus is 18-19 BILLION dollars 
Running Democratic seems to be working

9376 2018-03-12 00:12:31 These rotations are horrible Brian. Nets start slow because Spencer and DLo are oil and water. More like oil and oil.  Levert should start. That simple.
9377 2018-03-12 00:12:15 I use sweet almond oil and rosehip mostly then I deal with a butter mixture that contains Argan. I begin with HA
9378 2018-03-12 00:12:00 I was all about Lipidol but it no longer exists but any oil cleanser is where it’s at along with a good facecloth
9379 2018-03-12 00:11:59 It’s from the guys next door. They must have got a new massage oil from the flea market again.  #WhatsThatStrangeOdorInTheHouse
9380 2018-03-12 00:11:48 Nous aussi on donnera notre skincare routine. Eau plus coconut oil 
9381 2018-03-12 00:11:47 I use them in baths all the time! For congestion or cough, I mix a few drops of olive oil with a drop or two of eucalyptus & a drop or two of peppermint by rubbing them in my hands. Then I rub on my chest and take a hot bath. Congestion gone!
9382 2018-03-12 00:11:41 So what's your solution to oil transportation then?
9383 2018-03-12 00:11:27 ฉู้ๆนะนุช
9384 2018-03-12 00:11:24 Post surgery, decided to put away the opioids from the hospital and give CBD oil a try. Could be placebo, but it’s doing work. Not looking back
9385 2018-03-12 00:11:15 Literally an oil company @_geolog, likes your reply. Your candidate and his investments have contributed to climate change, which predominantly affects Black and Brown communities. He's a dirty capitalist parading as a radical. #twill
9386 2018-03-12 00:11:13 What are you going to do when the oil runs out...
Be prepared, ride bikes.
9387 2018-03-12 00:11:10 That is an incredible amount of fine olive oil
9388 2018-03-12 00:10:47 Rub some bio oil on them, it'll help fade them
9389 2018-03-12 00:10:34 One of those things Lisa is working on is the potential rape of the Arctic in the name of oil economy. It may be ok since the Arctic seems to be melting away.
We need less and less oil for 21st c economy.
9390 2018-03-12 00:10:24 None of the above. I'd actually go for 'greed of the oil companies'. The technology and resources are there, but while there are natural resources to plunder and profits to be made, electric transport won't get a look-in.
9391 2018-03-12 00:10:24 Sliquid, Pjur, coconut oil

9394 2018-03-12 00:10:05 Well idk if I should take that as a compliment or feel offended... either way thanks anddd I use pure coconut oil

9400 2018-03-12 00:09:05 Petrostate: «a small oil-rich country in which institutions are weak and wealth and power are concentrated in the hands of a few» I’m norwegian, and i’ll give u the oil one, but the rest is just patently untrue.
9401 2018-03-12 00:08:58 And when the time comes,they'll be humble...
9402 2018-03-12 00:08:52 The secret to perfect Dijon vinaigrette?  Mix the red wine vinegar with the mustard and salt before adding the olive oil, or else the mustard will clump. (And don't use whole-grain mustard either because it won't form an emulsion with the oil. You change the oil/vinegar/mustard.)
9403 2018-03-12 00:08:45 Looks like we need a couple of dozen oil rigs and maybe a little strip mining to jazz up the place. All this nature stuff is a little disconcerting.
9404 2018-03-12 00:08:31 For year ending June 2017 North Head Sewage Treatment Plant at Manly pumped 73% of oil & grease from influent into the ocean 3.5km from shoreline - that didn't breach the plant's Environment Protection Licence - load limits for O&G discharged to the ocean were set in 1990s.
9405 2018-03-12 00:08:22 Chopped fresh garlic, yellow onion, jalapeno, big green Mexican pepper, green chilies in hot olive oil. Once that's smelling good, pour a can of diced tomatoes. Fill w/ chicken stock. chopped cilantro, black beans, hominy, grilled chicken, hot sauce. Then medium spices.
9406 2018-03-12 00:08:19 in the sense that his more recent work is snake oil confirming a series of deeply problematic beliefs about the state of the world and the historical arc of progress (so called) I’d back up the assertion. He’s not just making spurious claims- he’s selling a worrying product.
9407 2018-03-12 00:08:16 Cali is boycotting oil? lol
9408 2018-03-12 00:08:06 So?

Coal and oil jobs also contribute to killing people.

We open up more opportunities in alternative energies.

People must be capable of change, otherwise they get left behind.
9409 2018-03-12 00:07:28 Kale sauteed in olive oil and lemon. Otherwise, it's for the bunnies :)
9410 2018-03-12 00:07:19 I use coconut oil for literally everything

9415 2018-03-12 00:06:11 Do you have any coconut oil? or a light moisturizer without scent to help your skin calm down?
9416 2018-03-12 00:06:06 made beautiful essential oil necklaces and now we’re reading our birth charts 
ugh blessed
9417 2018-03-12 00:06:05 I sear both sides for about 2.5 minutes in a cast iron with peanut oil, then toss in the over for 2.5 minutes on each side
9418 2018-03-12 00:05:58 Very good
It's a solid little house
Discovered oak floor in the dining room, didn't even sand it, murphy's oil soap, and let it go. Maybe when the kids leave the nest...
9419 2018-03-12 00:05:35 gonna start a thread of the oil roll ons and their magical associations that I offer in my shop 
9420 2018-03-12 00:05:17 @ConorLambPA My father died in 1975 at the age of 40 after working 10 yrs in an unregulated oil refinery in Marcus Hook, PA. 763 other men from the same plant all died before retirement. Please stand for a safe work environment. It matters.
9421 2018-03-12 00:05:13 Yes, you are right.  Fields such as oil and gas explorations, pharmaceutical, etc. are much more affected by government regulations.
9422 2018-03-12 00:05:05 to go to the city nearby to buy some oil.
Let her go to some good (Life Coaches) to buy some Life Principles like Respect, Love, Tolerance..

9425 2018-03-12 00:04:58 I dont think so. The hard data is much weaker than ISM. I think its the shale oil economy that is distorting ISM, most likely.
9426 2018-03-12 00:04:53 Yeah the fenty be drying to fast that's why I put oil on my face so I want have patches
9427 2018-03-12 00:04:45 Exactly, if we get it to port we stand to make much more off our oil than we do now and we won't have to sell to the Americans at a massive discount

9433 2018-03-12 00:04:14 I just hope The Alliance is successful.  I do not like the future they are showing us in the present.  I want real weather, real skies, real food, NO GMO's  No to Clinton & Gates Foundations, No Cern No Artificial Intelligence. No Big Oil Subsidies, No GOVT Private Partnerships
9434 2018-03-12 00:04:08 The salon I go to is opening up a coffee shop inside and they have a drink with pure CBD oil in it. 
9435 2018-03-12 00:04:07 Obviously, her book would influence you. It's misleading with each nutrient in isolation, just because the nutrient is good doesn't mean the food is. Not very clear scientific evidence from her. Another paleo salesperson.  Corn oil in excess maybe? That's why minimizing oil works
9436 2018-03-12 00:04:06 THANKS FOR THE OIL LEAK REMINDER - THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY IT IS HARD TO REMEMBER THE ONE IN BURNABY!!!
9437 2018-03-12 00:03:56 lol... that was bound to happen.
9438 2018-03-12 00:03:48 Background: Comes from Edo period hair oil salesmen who took their time chitchatting with the customers when selling.
9439 2018-03-12 00:03:36 Most things have gotten more expensive.  Hydro? Fuel (even with crude oil at lows), food, housing.  The only thing not going up is middle class wages because of constant flux of imported cheap labour and immigration.
9440 2018-03-12 00:03:33 Pretty sure if we look hard enough his name is slapped on some snake oil that claims to cure it.
9441 2018-03-12 00:03:32 CeeC is likened to one of The 5 Foolish who didn't have oil in/for her lamp.

9442 2018-03-12 00:03:15 The market will set the #oil price (as both #OPEC and the US like to say when it suits them).
9443 2018-03-12 00:03:14 LoL...I basically got it from you. Black soap, Thayers, and I use a moisturizer by Shea Moisture that has 100% Virgin Coconut Oil or something...And a black mask once a week.
9444 2018-03-12 00:03:01 #AD54 is home to the largest urban oil fields in the country. LA needs to ban fracking & drilling and so does CA.

9450 2018-03-12 00:02:26 @Saccone4PA18 My father died in 1975 at the age of 40 after working 10 yrs in an unregulated oil refinery in Eastern PA. 763  men from the same refinery all died long before retirement age. After regulations were passed  employees started living longer. Why are you against them?

9456 2018-03-12 00:01:08 Thieves & tea tree are good for disinfecting. Peppermint and eucalyptus good for congestion. Use a carrier oil (like any bland oil - olive, coconut, etc) with peppermint, otherwise you could get burnt.
9457 2018-03-12 00:01:02 What is that? Olive oil with seasonings in it?
