3 2018-03-26 23:59:42 No offense MoD but the people who are fans of UK white nationalist and snake oil salesman Paul don't have time for facts and debunked myths. Only time they have is used to make the fearful afraid of everything.

5 2018-03-26 23:59:36 Sauté it in some garlic, oil, you could probably throw some white wine in it
6 2018-03-26 23:59:36 I love the l'oreal extraordinary oil shampoo, verb shampoo, and the cheapo sulfate free from TJ
7 2018-03-26 23:59:06 In America religious protections do not include throwing boiling oil into your child’s face. That’s cause for removing child from home. If the parents are immigrants - deport. If your religion includes child abuse/neglect it should be illegal - i.e., withholding medical care.

I’m getting the hang of this adult stuff

43 2018-03-26 23:55:58 Edgar Salinas- We take care of our elderly and children,  build and roof the homes of Albuquerque, pick the chile that we are so proud of, work in the dairies and oil fields, and work in the service and hospitality industries.
44 2018-03-26 23:55:47 Maybe people don’t know this but under @JohnKasich when a farmer got a lease agreement by oil and gas company the state of Ohio took a very large percentage of the farmers money. My mom had to give up almost 50,000.00. So Ohio gov made a lot of money 5 years ago
45 2018-03-26 23:55:31 This President Trump put tariffs on oil and fuel why is gas racing high

53 2018-03-26 23:54:21 Expelling Russian diplomats means nothing to Putin. How about the E.U stops purchasing his oil, that might actually hurt him.
54 2018-03-26 23:54:15 I’m going back to oil! you can’t compete with that in water based, looks fantastic 
55 2018-03-26 23:53:56 When I first started wearing make up I broke out real bad it’s just finding the brand ur face likes sometimes I don’t even wear foundation u can use rose oil as a moisturizer and that may calm ur skin down
56 2018-03-26 23:53:54 I want to know the price point for that because I was ready to drop 55.00 on that medusa shimmer oil for the summer so I can blind all the hood niggas at the hood cookouts imma be dragged to

68 2018-03-26 23:52:30 One question to ask to those bird brain cultural RETARDS is; what the hell Aussie soldiers still doing in Afghanistan and Iraq; to protect the $$$ Interests of DRUG CARTELS of USA and the Oil  giant US corporations?
69 2018-03-26 23:52:28 Amen but learn other hidden words palm anything glycol I call soaps glycerin go to palm oil websites get list it’s awful

77 2018-03-26 23:51:15 Tea tree oil. Every night.
78 2018-03-26 23:51:14 Smoke and mirrors @OKLegislature and @oksde. Raising the GPT a little now so the voters won't vote to raise it more in November is shameful.  Protect our kids instead of big oil. Stay aware of what's happening my friends
79 2018-03-26 23:51:00 I really need to find something to get this oil under control
80 2018-03-26 23:50:33 anyways why r we talking about  canola oil and selewhisper.
AG4 AND jb5 COMING FOR NECKS
81 2018-03-26 23:50:32 hahaha..
82 2018-03-26 23:50:29 I assume that all your investors are Canadian then, since you’re allowed to take a side. I’ve lived next to that refinery my whole life. I’m immune to the smell of gas. We don’t want more, and we’re willing to reduce dependency on oil. I’m Canadian and I’m entitled to my opinion.
83 2018-03-26 23:50:09 such a troubled young man
84 2018-03-26 23:49:56 a friend keeps on persuading me to buy a macbook :)) do i look like a daughter of a saudi arabian oil tycoon :)))
85 2018-03-26 23:49:47 Laundry done, got a oil change, & I’m happy now i just need to eat and relax until 9:30
86 2018-03-26 23:49:12 I did the research. Green technology already has more available jobs than oil extraction. And just by cancelling the oil subsidies, Canada could invest $3B/yr to make at least 100,000 more green jobs. Humans gave up horses and buggy whips. We can give up oil, as well.

88 2018-03-26 23:48:27 Any advice on a deterrent for my leather furniture? I heard orange essential oil with vinegar and water but not sure if I'll have to do it daily
89 2018-03-26 23:48:08 @Piech42 How does one cheat at Cricket? People in the stands making cricket chirping noises? Oil on the Wickets? (sticky wicket joke)   
90 2018-03-26 23:48:03 Under my bed there is:
-a bag of old, unused tax expense receipts
-an unopened massage oil bottle
-an unread copy of “the artists way”
-an unfinished “to do” list
...all from over 10 years ago.
91 2018-03-26 23:48:00 So apparently using oil on oily skin can actually reduce oiliness and breakouts.... who knew??? #skincaretips #skincare
92 2018-03-26 23:47:55 Fuck recipes that say shit like "a touch of olive oil" or "a dash of salt." What do you think this is? A technical challenge on the Great British Bake Off?
93 2018-03-26 23:47:41 Habló el nuevo titular de la AFIP: "Vamos a tomar todas las medidas para que Oil pague sus deudas" @infobae
94 2018-03-26 23:47:36 Makes sense as to why oil is going straight up again.
95 2018-03-26 23:47:32 19 (3-26): Is #olive_oil a good #moisturizer for your #face?
96 2018-03-26 23:47:28 Didn't China launch oil trading in Yuan yesterday? I'm sure this is will contribute to the dollar's decline.
97 2018-03-26 23:47:25 Why is milk price being raised? All the milk bags are recycled by the consumers or by rag pickers. This giving extra money and then collecting it back, all these are not required at all. What about the plastic bags used to pack the groceries, oil etc?
98 2018-03-26 23:47:17 ايش فيهم العباسيين
99 2018-03-26 23:47:06 like the princess in the fairytale whose father the king promised her hand in marriage to the man who could make her smile again, but the only thing that will make me happy is dumplings in szechuan chili oil
100 2018-03-26 23:47:01 To the oil companies to keep them from leaving the state. 2/2
101 2018-03-26 23:46:51 But...I thought you aren't suppose to use oil based products with condo...nevermind. This is probably bareback Twitter.
102 2018-03-26 23:46:46 Pour some oil in a pan. Toss some Brussels sprouts in that bitch, add a dash of water & cover. Let that bitch steam for like 10 min..Season with a dab of cinnamon & salt. Top with maple syrup, cheddar cheese, & almonds. Drizzle a lil balsamic glaze on top & ENJOY!! 
103 2018-03-26 23:46:36 Oh as much as I hate trump and devoss. This is Mary Fallin our state governor and resident she-devil. Our total revenue has fallen because the oil industry is drying up here- so she slices the budget for *literally* everything else so she can give money to the 1/2
104 2018-03-26 23:46:35 Tea tree oil bath whaat sounds amazing
105 2018-03-26 23:46:22 Most likely oil because I see it all over her body
106 2018-03-26 23:46:20 @jimcramer @CNBCFastMoney @SquawkCNBC

In your Nat Gas piece, a good points. 2 issues, 1 sugg on female guest:

1. This hits many, but is it the same for SandCos = needed for both gas & oil production, both in fracking & (now) traditional downwell drills, on and offshore?

(1/3)
107 2018-03-26 23:46:12 It would be fun to catch the Flames just because ... and then unless Oil win lottery perhaps trade the pick to Flames in a deal for Dougie Hamilton!
108 2018-03-26 23:46:08 Shit we produce enough oil nowadays. Just a easy excuse. We export a crap load of our oil.  Crazy they still using that one though. Drives ya nuts

C60 in olive oil an amazing antioxidant that has no toxic effects according to study done 2012 Univ Paris. Side effects included increased lifespan (15%) and there were no tumors in rats.

129 2018-03-26 23:43:51 "Premier Horgan (born a few years before me) certainly must remember the insane gyrations of the response to the OPEC oil embargo in the 1970s, as well as the causes of much misery."

136 2018-03-26 23:42:51 not odd at all. i was using a coconut hair oil from nutrient rich but switched to this basic coconut oil from island fresh
137 2018-03-26 23:42:33 One day I won’t be afraid of cooking with oil...one day.
138 2018-03-26 23:42:32 @jimmyjohns last week I was able to customize but it was gone 2day. All I wanted was olive oil & vinegar which I thought was included.
139 2018-03-26 23:42:25 How even? It's just olive oil, vinegar, and spices. I picture it going down like lava lamp fluid
140 2018-03-26 23:42:14 My sister just got an essential oil diffuser. I walked up to it and said, "Hey Google"
She was not amused
141 2018-03-26 23:42:06 2070!  What idiot believe this pap! This gives them plenty of time to finish off the last economic deposits of oil and gas.  We can go zero emissions, but only after they've made as much money as possible first by burning shit and polluting our air/water. Lets go zero CO2 NOW!
142 2018-03-26 23:42:01 Yoruba ppl do that a lot to me here in Lagos,I pretend not to understand, just when I'm about to leave,I will say something deep and savage that'll shake them to their bone marrow
143 2018-03-26 23:41:53 Thank you shale plays, fracking and horizontal drilling, we are now using oil exports as a bargaining tool with our enemies.
144 2018-03-26 23:41:47 Could you be putting a natural cream on it to help the skin with its elasticity ?? Olive oil perhaps??
145 2018-03-26 23:41:47 I like to add a bit of broth to the veggies, about 1/4th a cup or enough to cover the bottom and season the veggies.

Then I arrange the chicken on top and season with salt, pepper, and a bit of sesame oil!

Cooked on low for 6-8hrs!

I serve it on rice! You also have a dressing!

151 2018-03-26 23:41:11 But you can't really make any money selling fish/flax oil 
152 2018-03-26 23:41:02 my oil diffuser makes me feel so calm
153 2018-03-26 23:40:48 Where is the data? Always room to improve. I don’t understand the negativity towards Alberta oil given there is no transparency in other (most) oil producing nations.

158 2018-03-26 23:40:05 Russia sells s400 and do oil deals in return for Afrin. But I suspect the main reason letting it fall was because it increases the chances they'll attack Manbji if they had Afrin. The Russians want Turkey to attack the US in Manbji. So Ru is really setting them up for a big fall.
159 2018-03-26 23:40:04 Meet @RoadshowPBS in St. Louis to search for treasures, including a 1920 Grace Ravlin oil painting, a Michael Jackson-signed fedora and photo from around 1990, and a Tiffany GMT-Master Rolex, ca. 1963. Can you guess which is the big find of the night? Tonight at 7pm on #KLRU.
160 2018-03-26 23:40:03 Divine, light an oil lamp. What really knocks me out is a miracle.
161 2018-03-26 23:39:59 If I had hoes y’all Gota have low mileaGe... ain’t Got time for oil leaks or no blown transmissions n shit 
162 2018-03-26 23:39:55 Nah, Iran. It would knock out their oil production, enriching US & Russia oil business. Besides, don’t Iran is nuclear yet but NK sure is, and they are chickenshits.
163 2018-03-26 23:39:53 Since I like chicken with skin on, I seared each side for 3min on each side with oil before potting

I chunked carrots, potatoes, & celery and place them in the bottom.

Then I cut up some leeks and spring onions, those go next.

Add garlic to your pref!
164 2018-03-26 23:39:46 Neutrogena Body Oil is the freaking best....and people wonder why I smell good lol
165 2018-03-26 23:39:42 Drilled the Storm Drive #stormnation and threw yesterday.  Had a very controllable break point. I threw it on a dry house pattern yet the ball did not roll out and still had plenty of energy on the back end. Looking forward to throwing it on a heavier oil pattern.
166 2018-03-26 23:39:38 Does Diversity matter if you just plan to drop an oil well at the base of Half Dome. This is less about Diversity and more about Zinke’s failed leadership and complete mid-use of public funds.
167 2018-03-26 23:39:08 A Royal sub.

It's essentially a sub consisting of the usual suspects (cheese, oil, mayo, lettuce, tomato & onion), with a combo of Italian sausage & pan seared capicola. It's best if the cheese is allowed to melt and the roll is lightly toasted.

176 2018-03-26 23:37:38 Turns out the loud explosions I heard from my apartment last night were from Chevron digging a new oil extraction site near my house. This is one of the not great parts about living in LA.

184 2018-03-26 23:36:05 Organic rose hip oil at night. For day choose something with hyuralonic acid. Stay away from the retinoids/retinols in summer... they’ll make the dark spots more prominent.
185 2018-03-26 23:35:40 Great choices! Make sure with a glycolic acid that high (it’s actually not crazy high) you invest in a good SPF for daily use. I recommend the Lancôme one, when I went to Jamaica it was perfect. Not oily (oil free), lightweight after reapplication & doesn’t make you blue/ashy.

237 2018-03-26 23:25:58 We just need an oil crisis and then it’s great again
238 2018-03-26 23:25:43 With reduced demand for gas will come reduced demand for oil. There will be consolidation. To the efficient go the spoils.

242 2018-03-26 23:25:05 So I saw this float by weeks ago and thought "well that's cool but I have a beard, won't work" and it *just* hit me that I actually own oil for my beard and am an idiot. Anyway I'm going to try this.

245 2018-03-26 23:24:26 Which oil is used for the body oil?
246 2018-03-26 23:24:24 Those rights plenty well protected in Canada. Why do we not see protests against oil tankers in St. Lawrence River by #HumanRights abusing nations with a far worse environmental track record than Canada ?

Shipping oil by rail is better, crowding out grain shipments? Why?

250 2018-03-26 23:23:52 The lightness of the oil is only one factor. Production methodology, location, transportation all relevant factors. But Russia has no ghg regs applicable to their industry. So yeah if you love Russia attack Canada production.
251 2018-03-26 23:23:51 Chemicals, plastics most cosmetics take oil and gas, industry will still be strong.

253 2018-03-26 23:23:38 Are there people out there that actually get their teeth cleaned every 6 months, get their oil changed on time, go to the gym regularly, eat healthy, pay their bills on time, go to the doctor when they are sick, read regularly, etc.

Bc I feel like they are mythological creatures
254 2018-03-26 23:23:26 My comment was about the federal government arresting elected officials. Nothing about oil. As an educated gay person, seeing these types of tactics used in Canada in 2018 should terrify you. No matter what your stance on this pipeline is. Historically, minorities are next.

Most if the EU depend on Ruskii oil!!!

...

RT @LukeDCoffey: My question is: why only 14 EU members? All 28 should be expelling Russian diplomats.
302 2018-03-26 23:16:56 Biggest pet peeve: asking for advice on Facebook over things like 
-shampoo products
-day care recommendations 
-places to get an oil change
-diets 
-anything else stupid that should be googled.
**even bigger pet peeve:
-when these status’s get 40+ comments
303 2018-03-26 23:16:55 Expelling diplomats is a symbolic move with Europe's excessive dependence on Russian energy imports and #Germany and others signing new deals with Putin who increased Russian stakes in Iraq, Syria, Iran, Venezuela, Qatar... oil & gas, boosting Russia's global market share
304 2018-03-26 23:16:45 Proponents of Monterey County’s Measure Z ballot initiative filed an appeal today challenging a Superior Court ruling earlier this month. A Judge left Z's fracking ban in place but invalidated the prohibition on new oil wells and the phaseout of wastewater disposal.

311 2018-03-26 23:16:02 What this says is 42% of our country has a self esteem issue and doesn’t think we deserve better than this snake oil salesman. He lies. He cheats. He’s in the pocket of Putin. We deserve better.

323 2018-03-26 23:14:05 Actually the yuan used in these new oil future contracts will be directly convertible into gold, similar to the US dollar prior to 1971. Many currency watchers noted China has been importing considerably more gold than official records indicate. China is playing to win.

340 2018-03-26 23:12:08 Dear @JacindaArdern
I support the call to #EndOil & gas exploration. With communities already suffering impacts of #climatechange, searching for new oil is untenable. Your commitment to make climate change your nuclear-free moment has the power to inspire a nation, and the world.
341 2018-03-26 23:12:00 Expelled 60 Russian spies, closed Russian facility in Seattle, missile attack against Syria, expanded sanctions on Moscow, gave lethal aid to Ukraine, sent troops into Poland against Russian objection, expanded oil exports into East Europe. Seems more like Putin is Trump’s bitch.
342 2018-03-26 23:11:58 Dry joke ...crack another one
343 2018-03-26 23:11:32 That not how you check the oil.?.?.

346 2018-03-26 23:11:12 I have not done right by my gut for the past 2 days and it feels like 2 weeks. 

My mind is super cloudy, burps are like vegetable oil. Nah brethren. Back on the protein shake meal plan come tomorrow.
347 2018-03-26 23:11:11 the university of oklahoma just named a former energy company exec as its new president. oklahoma is so deep into oil companies' pockets.
348 2018-03-26 23:11:10 She literally said ‘and then roast’. So did you tell it harsh home-truths disguised as jokes as well as the oil or not?
349 2018-03-26 23:11:02 he nuts oil but i look past that
350 2018-03-26 23:10:55 Brit Hume is right.Russia's economy is not good. It's VERY important we become energy independent. First to supply ourselves and our military at all times...secondly to export oil and gas products a and become pertinent in that market.
We cannot depend on energy from the mideast.

382 2018-03-26 23:06:27 We have the 2nd most known resources of oil and gas in the world beneath our feet.  We should be paying a fraction of  what we pay now.  Corrupt, greedy, free spending liberal governments are wasting our legacy.
383 2018-03-26 23:06:22 Looks like an oil painting! 
384 2018-03-26 23:06:20 Even up to this day: diamonds, gold, silver, aluminum, copper, nickel, manganese, oil, gas, silica, sulphur, uranium, plutonium and water. Strategic resources at the expense of poverty, misery and exploitation of “developing countries ”

389 2018-03-26 23:05:35 There's a difference btwn turpentine oil & mineral spirits or turpentine. A mixture of turpentine oil & castor oil are often used used to cure digestive issues. Alone, turpentine oil is used as a linament--mostly in veterinary medicine,  but sometimes people use it.

432 2018-03-26 22:59:24 Canadian oil production is forecast to be over 5 million barrels/per day in 2018.    At $60 oil, that's $300 million/day or $110 billion per year.

Alberta took in around $1 billion in oil royalties last year.

When the Texas oil corporations get all the money, it's not our oil.
433 2018-03-26 22:59:11 So I can’t drop my phone in water with out t breaking but I can drop it into 350 degree frying oil and it’s totally fine good to know apple good to know
434 2018-03-26 22:59:06 Conspiracy theorists we need:
"If we get the public behind alternative energy for home electronics and automobiles, we'll break the clandestine hold of the oil companies."

The kind we get:
"HERE'S HOW TO TURN HUMAN FECES INTO GUNPOWDER FOR THE BULLET FACTORY IN YOUR BASEMENT!"
435 2018-03-26 22:59:05 @Simpson_Rick Macmillan are saying Cannabis oil can cause cancer! Outrageous as they omit to mention that Chemo/CT & MRI scans can cause cancer. Advice on a good argument? I am going to complain as I think its one sided & misleading.
436 2018-03-26 22:58:47 Kicking their diplomats out of the country will have a negligible effect. Putin will do the same to the US. What Putin doesn't want are sanctions, freezing assets and trade barriers on Russian steel, oil and gas.

441 2018-03-26 22:57:36 Most likely Iran. Gold and oil and very little repercussions.  NK is too risky.

446 2018-03-26 22:56:53 The number of oil tankers is jumping from 5 to 37, that's a huge increase. Fortunately, there is a federal election on the horizon for 2019 and the gov't most likely to form the next gov't does not get it's support from Alberta and Big Oil, but rather young progressive voters.
447 2018-03-26 22:56:44 Look up Biafra the origin of most Black Americans and see that slavery and GENOCIDE is still ongoing by British govt and their jihadists to steal oil. Support REFERENDUM for Biafra Jews and Christians in West Africa.
448 2018-03-26 22:56:44 remember when i was crying at essential garden because my mom wouldn’t bring me my olive oil.

450 2018-03-26 22:56:37 We see Kaplan leaving a Costco with industrial-sized containers of coconut oil.
451 2018-03-26 22:56:36 Well, we still need oil for quite some time.  I am all for alternative green energy sources but it is premature to think we can run green everywhere and for everything.  We north of 60 can't rely on electric vehicles reliably yet.  Military can't.  Airliners can't.
452 2018-03-26 22:56:24 But ... Alberta sells its highly polluting tar sand oil at a discount and Canadians subsidise them to the tune of more than $3 billion yr. There is adequate conventional oil and gas.  That IMHO is what we should be using up until we convert to renewables.
453 2018-03-26 22:56:19 I know you'll be coming here to defend your paymaster even if he was sliting your throat, @bukolasaraki is a proven enemy of Nigeria and democracy, I'm glad most senators are beginning to have their voice and revolt against him,his time is up InshaAllah.

457 2018-03-26 22:55:46 Boko Haram source of power would be cut off by President Donald Trump  very soon with Biafra endorsement in the next 48 hours like it took France to surrender to Israel. Let Biafra get back control of its Oil, America will destroy the terrorists group and their founder Buhari

460 2018-03-26 22:55:33 Or an oil pipeline?
461 2018-03-26 22:55:24 Because he's afraid of China, and Iran has the most oil in the world.

477 2018-03-26 22:53:18 Wasn't Erdogan the guy who authorize and hid the purchases of ISIS crude oil trucked into Turkey, thereby funding ISIS terrorist's?
Don't tell me he wasn't aware or that it didn't happen, there's plenty of video available.
He funded a worldwide terrorist regime, ISIS.

500 2018-03-26 22:50:11 #pnpcbc As long as there is a demand for fossil fuels someone will produce them and we will have these pipeline debates. Ultimately the only way to stop producing oil is by market forces. I.e. no one wants to use it so it becomes unprofitable to produce it.
501 2018-03-26 22:49:35 Yes was just reading that! They made a better job of it yes. Got a little lucky with oil price and production levels but the gamble they made paid off. Unfortunately we can't go back though so need to make the best of what we have.

575 2018-03-26 22:40:27 Agreed, Boren was the best at that. I just wonder if Gallogly can/will leverage his oil and gas connections.

581 2018-03-26 22:39:54 'woof woof. because i want to feel the hot oil batter me raw! it was the entire point of my story mode in bon appetit!'
582 2018-03-26 22:39:52 Data is not the new oil. Conclusion is.
583 2018-03-26 22:39:46 Who besides the oil and gas industry urged Fallin not to raise taxes?  Big Wind (heh)?  Big tobacco?  Any other special interests?
584 2018-03-26 22:39:46 please..when digging deeper ..did you find gold   ..or is that eastern foreign oil reserves keep your boy aloft in the air  ?
585 2018-03-26 22:39:42 Can you get me one i'm in pain i don't want to take opiods for the rest of my life sigh i want something natural i think the oil from marijuana without the THC is better it goes internally
586 2018-03-26 22:39:32 Wow! I tried oil paint. Ang baho haha. Pero hindi ko kaya yung portrait :( puro lang ako flowers, landscape. Huhuhuhu
587 2018-03-26 22:39:23 Convocados por el juez del concurso de Oil Combustibles -el motor del Grupo Indalo-, los funcionarios de la AFIP plantearon que las opciones que le quedan a la petrolera son mínimas. O, en la práctica, inexistentes para una empresa cuya situación calificaron como "crítica". LN.

590 2018-03-26 22:38:41 Easy to say the Iraq war was a mistake sitting in the comfort of US domestic shale oil. No one in 2003 knew shale would save our bacon. 

If you have a time machine I'll be happy to travel back in time to let them know the USA will be the largest producer of oil by 2023.
591 2018-03-26 22:38:25 @jimcramer natgas is the future.  Oil companies will be called gas companies one day.  Long time off though, 50+ years.  Even with strong renewable growth.  Some days sun doesn’t shine and wind doesn’t blow.
592 2018-03-26 22:38:21 Finally! I always want body oil but can never find one for my skin tone and my price range!
593 2018-03-26 22:38:08 Yes often protesters do get hurt. I am also all for anyone harming another being charged, be it a protester or a police officer, or hired thugs by oil companies.
594 2018-03-26 22:38:06 I honestly don’t know why people send nudes. I’d much rather receive a tasteful yet suggestive oil painting.
595 2018-03-26 22:37:50 I stopped lighting candles after cleaning my room - now I just run my oil blend for a clear mind .
596 2018-03-26 22:37:44 These leftists are so silly.
597 2018-03-26 22:37:42 Never leave out the bacon.

605 2018-03-26 22:35:28 Uh, no, this is NOT a good idea, no way no how. Turpentine is poison. It cleans paint brushes and oil. Think of what it can do to your stomach. It could kill you. No, don't go there; otherwise you'll be headed to the ER.

615 2018-03-26 22:35:01 When Jimmy Carter was president, he blamed the "overconsumption" of American citizens for the U.S. oil shortages and other economic problems such as product shortages, double-digit inflation, and extremely high unemployment. :( #fail

619 2018-03-26 22:34:43 Literally this should be put on billboards where ever the decision-makers for the Oil drive b/c it shouldn't be up for debate that he loses his job seeing this stat.
620 2018-03-26 22:34:41 We're always going to need oil because we need it to make plastics. Without plastics you ladies would have to start using acorns for dildos again or whatever like they did back in the 20s.
621 2018-03-26 22:34:38 Roast in 350F oven, drizzle w olive oil, salt, pepper. Add garlic and shallots for more non-bacon punch
622 2018-03-26 22:34:37 Russia, Iran want oil prices to spike & our stupid bipartisan congress doesn't  seem to get it, they want US to abandon helping Saudis. Congress has always lost what was gained on the battlefront. Vietnam, Iraq, Syria,Afghanistan, Panama are few examples. The limit a president's

The import of Nigerian crude oil by the United States rose by 48 per cent to 112.92 million barrels last year, the highest annual level in five years, @MobilePunch.
633 2018-03-26 22:33:44 Agreed!  I would love to have seen a rational reconsideration of the regulatory environment. Cut rules that don't work or don't matter. Instead we put an oil man in charge of EPA and private school advocate in charge of Education, etc.
634 2018-03-26 22:33:43 I’m not into guys putting oil on me during sex.
635 2018-03-26 22:33:30 Should never do transmissions oil...if there is something wrong the gear box need replacing.

638 2018-03-26 22:33:14 One canNOT discuss any global issue without looking at BOTH sides of the issue, ie costs AND benefits. It's not we can just turn the oil (plus gas plus coal) tap off & get the same benefits. 8B people, soon 10B, gotta eat and get around. We can discuss overpopulation, if you want
639 2018-03-26 22:33:07 Listen, Dettlaff probably isn't that hard but I foolishly didn't think to prepare before the quest so I had to fight him with fucked armour and a fucked sword and only standard vampire oil and black blood. It was a TASK.

644 2018-03-26 22:32:40 I had to quit posing for oil painters who keep open containers of turpenoids because it makes me sick AND lose my behavioral filters. And they tell me that volatile vapors can't hurt me if they have the scent removed. But autisim warrior mommys™ make their kids drink bleach.
645 2018-03-26 22:32:30 It's a Kia it has a recall because when they manufactured the engines they left metal shavings which blocks the oil flow or some shit so they have to replace the whole thing FOR THE FREE!!

650 2018-03-26 22:32:13 Really !?! Min for Energy and Resources Megan Woods tells Oil Conference that existing permits, some of which run as late as 2046, are not under threat. I guess #CPTPP wont let us change that too or risk being sued #endoil #climatejustice

678 2018-03-26 22:29:06 I don’t understand one thing, why do our links and what you say have nothing to do with each other? To start off btw, the UN has created a conglomerate of anti-Israel countries, due to major anti-Israel countries controlling oil, and thus, international ground.
679 2018-03-26 22:28:55 Let me get this right, our moral leader is a worn out porn queen, our social advisers are high school kids, Islam is a peaceful religion that pours hot oil on daughters that won,t be forced to marry men 40 yrs older then them, tearing apart a fetus 2 days before birth to sell
680 2018-03-26 22:28:44 JRM is a charlatan and the S*n is the can where he carries his snake oil. A loathsome double act.

683 2018-03-26 22:28:10 Russian oil is lighter so if you really want to reduce emissions let them supply their neighbors rather than us  endangering our country to ship bitumen across the ocean.
684 2018-03-26 22:28:00 Are your sinuses bugging you?  Boil 1 cup of water, drop in 2 drops essential oil, using a towel and with eyes closed (carefully) tent above the cup of water and inhale through your nose. Not easy but effective 
685 2018-03-26 22:27:19 Why did Rockefeller patent the African Zika virus in 1947. It began quietly circulated in West Africa in 2007.

698 2018-03-26 22:25:07 Even if u carry Shea Butter, honey, sugar cane, oil, and massage her head, Cee-c will still 'stand' nd 'fight' regardless of the outcome, that's a troublemaker for me.
699 2018-03-26 22:25:00 Turkey is no friend. They were who ISIS sold all the oil they stole from Iraq to. Several clips of footage of whole convoys of tanker trucks going to and from....until Russia stepped in & bombed em back to middle ages. Obama did nothing.

Alberta desperately needs a national energy plan.  Then Eastern Canada could import Alberta crude and refine it in Eastern refineries. Currently the east imports foreign oil which is stupid.

712 2018-03-26 22:23:55 My mom scheduled me an oil change at firestone on my day off........while i appreciate this whoooooo tollldddd herrrrr to dooooo thaaaaat
713 2018-03-26 22:23:55 Word on the street is Rihanna is launching body oil, if it’s true I need it all!!!
714 2018-03-26 22:23:34 A country with some of the worlds largest oil reserves yet thousands of people are starving to death. It does not get more mis-managed than that.
715 2018-03-26 22:23:33 My bootlaces are German tourists are magical! If you thing Virgin olive oil comes from???
716 2018-03-26 22:23:12 #pnpcbc  it is all very well for BC to complain about oil spills but the BC mining industry is hardly any better. Many rivers have suffered from toxic spills too. There is a measure of hypocrisy here.
717 2018-03-26 22:23:00 Yeah, that's why Uncle Sam invaded it by mocking the @UN® and extracted the oil lavishly. Alright.
718 2018-03-26 22:22:59 آمين يارب
719 2018-03-26 22:22:55 Clotted soy oil? No, just a placebo.
720 2018-03-26 22:22:55 FENTY BEAUTY IS COMING OUT WITH SHIMMERING BODY OIL!!! BIHHHHHHH RIHANNA DID NOT COME TO PLAY THIS SUMMER.
721 2018-03-26 22:22:54 Yeah and proper butter not any of that butter and vegetable oil muck...
722 2018-03-26 22:22:36 GIRL! Trust levels at an all time low lol put some baking soda in there to clear up the oil
723 2018-03-26 22:22:22 But with palm oil. Defos check the ingredients. Vegan friendly yes if you have no morals.
724 2018-03-26 22:22:18 Thank you for the service compliment, Devan!  We do currently have some facilities that do oil changes, but it's not common at all locations.  This may be a consideration in the future.  In the meantime we appreciate you choosing Les Schwab!  - Nate
725 2018-03-26 22:22:15 #pnpcbc Robin where is the oil industry that stood behind Notley?
Nowhere to be found... they all left the country!!

727 2018-03-26 22:22:09 I threw up in my mouth at that headline. Good Lord.
728 2018-03-26 22:21:58 I don’t follow her either...unfollowed when she became a flip flop.
729 2018-03-26 22:21:52 I am allowed to be upset that my new University President does not have the necessary experience for the job. I am also allowed to be upset that the same man is a champion of big oil companies. Stop acting like there is nothing bad about this decision.
730 2018-03-26 22:21:50 Not sure about the argument about refining in Canada is uneconomic. More about concentration of ownership (not in Canada) of the oil industry? Maybe!?! #pnpcbc

732 2018-03-26 22:21:45 What the hell has oil and fish got to do with CFP?
733 2018-03-26 22:21:40 USA lost Africa not long ago, the s**thole comment was the last straw. Your country really needs you to be the good oil and goodwill ambassador.
734 2018-03-26 22:21:37 厄介なことに行動力と声の大きさだけはあるからなぁ

736 2018-03-26 22:21:09 Oman didn't/doesn't have a multi-decade foreign policy goal to break the US$ as a global reserve currency.

Chinese oil futures will succeed because they have to as part of this wider foreign policy goal
737 2018-03-26 22:21:03 こんな酷い記事が朝方とはいえトレンドにはいる、なんとも
738 2018-03-26 22:21:03 It's alright. It's made with palm oil so it's still got a hint of cruelty 
739 2018-03-26 22:20:58 I could always use a oil rag for working on my cars.
740 2018-03-26 22:20:53 Rinse your hair with coconut milk 

Deep condition regularly 

Then always moisturize & seal I.e. a water based leave in conditioner followed by a natural essential oil that softens eg olive, grapes, Almond and/or Jojoba oil
Water oils and Leave in conditioners are your friends!
741 2018-03-26 22:20:48 Naked, covered in oil ?
742 2018-03-26 22:20:45 BUT IT EVIDENCE BREAK OUT COLD WIVES POWERCUT A BODY SHOOK HANDS COPS STAY HOME TEST AUTOS NOTHING DELICIOUS OIL POOL AWAY
743 2018-03-26 22:20:44 Here's an analogy for you. Are you willing to put your money where your mouth is? i.e. Stop using all oil products while others don't? No? Didn't think so but that is the equivalent of what you are asking Canadian industry to do. That's hypocritical
744 2018-03-26 22:20:36 Just dropped 115$ on a oil change 
745 2018-03-26 22:20:36 One thing.  You have to find the right source.  Like everything, there are lots of bs products.  Plus cbd oil has to have a thc component in order t be effective in adults.  Great for everything robin described.  Message me if you have questions.

747 2018-03-26 22:20:32 To HELL with the kids, I'm in love with Dana Loesch! I can't help myself! I have this recurring fantasy of her naked, covered in G96 gun oil, pointing a S&W, Model 29- 44 Magnum with the original 6.5" barrel & full house loads @ me! GOD, SHE'S HOT!!
748 2018-03-26 22:20:19 I once knew an artist who had permanent neurological problems from her occupational exposure to turpentine (as an oil painter)... she had strong warnings about turps for anyone who even dabbled in painting
749 2018-03-26 22:20:19 The media takes on this get worse by the day.
750 2018-03-26 22:20:13  RT @Cyn_Santana: Tell that bitch having kids has MAD side effects  RT @CruzanChoklate: “Birth control has side effects!” 

Yes girl, so does Tylenol and lavender and tea tree oil. 

Pipe down.
751 2018-03-26 22:20:12 Tired of oil changes 
752 2018-03-26 22:20:11 I got an oil change last week and I ended up needing a new $400 starter 
753 2018-03-26 22:20:03 rather than "the Jesus Story."     On top of that -- your geography seems to be situated on some sort of an "energy conduit" - in proximity to transport of oil.  TWO STRIKES AGAINST YOU, little baby.
754 2018-03-26 22:19:58 悪魔の証明から人格批判と、ほんまくそみたい
755 2018-03-26 22:19:52 @PnPCBC Instead of bashing the oil industry these environmental protesters should be taking a swipe at much of our country including Ontario,Quebec, Maritimes and BC that spew untreated treated  or minimally treated effluent into our  rivers and the oceans.
756 2018-03-26 22:19:51 Can we break out the tear gas and rubber bullets yet? But make sure they're real rubber bullets and not the synthetic oil product kind, cause we're sensitive to these hypocrites (clad in oil byproduct clothes, backpacks, and shoes, etc)....errrrrr protestors & their plight
757 2018-03-26 22:19:50 Oil can guitars are awesome. There's a guy near me that makes them and also cigar box guitars.
758 2018-03-26 22:19:46 I have a weird dog who doesn't care for peanut butter, but I eat the Skippy Natural, which is just peanuts, oil, sugar and salt, no hydrogenated oils or sugar substitutes, so that's what I offered the dog.
759 2018-03-26 22:19:38 Took my car to @pepboysauto in Huntsville AL Sat. For an oil change. Was told I needed additional work over $1000.  Did not have it done no $$. Called Diehl’s to check their prices.  Took it in for them to look at it.  No work needed.  Don’t go to @pepboysauto
760 2018-03-26 22:19:03 Drinking burnt motor oil and fake smiling for four hours is exhausting.
761 2018-03-26 22:19:01 Thanks for the shout out  : )  I like oil painting : )

765 2018-03-26 22:18:21 What about...
Midnight Oil- Blue Sky Mining
766 2018-03-26 22:18:21 Tell me how selling off public land to big oil helps you, me, or conservationism. Or how investing in oil rather than alternative sources of energy is better for the environment. I’ll wait
767 2018-03-26 22:18:12 Omg I'm sweating my sins away in this tea tree oil bath.
768 2018-03-26 22:18:07 Thats great, but if you read the article it those investments were triggered when the oil price was high. Read on, investment down 30%, 8% lower than forecast.

772 2018-03-26 22:17:32 Oh ffs. Are you trying to be dense. The goal is to reduce emissions. If we stop growing our oil production, Russia will fill the void and make no effort to reduce any emissions. Alberta producers ARE at least making an effort. In the meantime I'd rather keep our economy going?
773 2018-03-26 22:17:29 So excited to try these new teas I got lol. I also got my peppermint oil too  spider season got me bent
774 2018-03-26 22:17:01 Our side? I see. Hmmmm.  The oil is our oil bruahahahaha
775 2018-03-26 22:16:54 Is it just the quantities of oil/ghee they tend to use?

778 2018-03-26 22:16:39 Spilled oil all over my flower printed vans 
779 2018-03-26 22:16:29 Someone doesn't want the Canadian economy to advance. Someone doesn't want Alberta oil to reach the global market. Someone is financing these protesters.

In the lower mainland, land of multi million dollar shanties, who doesn't want a strong growing economy? Who wants $5 gas?
780 2018-03-26 22:16:15 Oohhh.. You might want to thin the paint down a notch or two. What kind of paint it is that needs to dry 24 hours?!? Oil? :O

784 2018-03-26 22:15:50 The BC Director of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation is using her platform to campaign for Big Oil and ridicule people for what they wear, while they exercise their right to free speech. Not everyone on the mountain was arrested or breaking the law, but still were ridiculed!

789 2018-03-26 22:15:01 Went to a house party with my younger brother for the first time this past weekend. Felt like it was a pretty cool moment until he found a bottle of olive oil in the kitchen and started handing it to drunk kids telling them to take shots. Gonna give it a few more years

Slamma Greg Gianforte has just introduced legislation to open up 800,000 acres of Montana public lands for exploration /mining of oil, minerals, etc.

793 2018-03-26 22:14:38 Yes thats all fine but the fact remains that N Sea oil revenues at the current oil prices are all but £0. In fact tax cuts given to N sea by WM to keep it afloat meant a loss last year. Doesn't matter how much there is if its too expensive to sell. Remember demand is falling too.

800 2018-03-26 22:13:24 Evolution comes in steps, not sure how you would have seen clean tech develop 50 years ago. Can’t really blame big oil when everyone has same opportunity to do better/different. Oil made world go round til now. Now is change, you fall and you get up.

Petron will implement the following price increases (VAT incl) effective 6 a.m. tomorrow, March 27: P1.15/li for gasoline, P1.10/li diesel, and P1.00/li for kerosene. These reflect movements in the international oil market. Thank you.

I happen to not see any expansion of fossil fuel be it heavy oil or light as a good thing because of the climate. But I would like to see more focus on demand curtailment of it's use as that will decrease the desire to increase production.
805 2018-03-26 22:12:30 The use of the oil weapon caused enormous problems - while everyone has their view on the Saudis they helped to break OPEC...but also caused indirectly the Shah’s fall as oil prices dropped
806 2018-03-26 22:12:07 Their scientists new back in the 80's that growing oil use had the possibility to radically affect the climate of the planet because of CO2. They were just waiting for the right time to come up with solution that may create a business possibility.
807 2018-03-26 22:12:00 If you were looking to identify or detect anything using machines...what would it be?  Would it be identifying a blood type? How about a different grade of oil? Or even telling the difference between seeds?

WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO IDENTIFY? #yeg #agchat #MedEd #science #Detective

856 2018-03-26 22:04:52 CIA and governments  of USA allowed attack twin tower in new york to To take possession of the oil of iraq and afganistan
857 2018-03-26 22:04:48 since yall love that oil meme why don't I see helicopters and armies on my skin

861 2018-03-26 22:04:18 First time in ages I managed some #selfcare today. I got to put oil on my arms and legs after my 2 minute shower instead of getting dressed damn as usual. #Winning
862 2018-03-26 22:04:16 @Colgate @OralB @Unilever  Please sell free of fluoride toothpaste option. Coconut oil + many things protect better, Fluoride was toxic waste added to water by Hitler so dumbed enslaved. Look at ingredient of existing free of fluoride toothpastes such as Himalaya Botanique.
863 2018-03-26 22:04:16 I hear coconut oil is good to brush your teeth with
864 2018-03-26 22:04:11 いえいえ！大丈夫ですよだって英語でSunmiだったらスンミと読んでしまっても仕方ないですしわいなんてスナミンって間違えてたんですよそれに比べたら全然マシです
865 2018-03-26 22:03:55 I’ve heard African black soap is super good but I have yet to try it. I’m so scared that things are gonna make me break out or dry my skin out even more. i just got this overnight face oil yesterday I’ll let you know if it helps dry skin at all

870 2018-03-26 22:02:41 You do know ExxonMobil scientists invented the same lithium battery your phone is running on? You do realise how many chemical products are from oil... Think or read before you Pick a side
871 2018-03-26 22:02:35 OIL DIFF: 4.59 -> 4.58
872 2018-03-26 22:02:32 Let’s hire his PR and legal team to go after the lies and hyperbole relating to oil and gas in Canada. Crush them at their own game. #greenpeacelies
873 2018-03-26 22:01:48 Sure, wine is great but have you ever smelled a freshly opened bottle of olive oil?
874 2018-03-26 22:01:47 @Su1cideByC0p I found oil...

In Israel
875 2018-03-26 22:01:28 Formula for success: rise early, work hard, strike oil.
876 2018-03-26 22:01:14 It's to the point where a guy can't quit a job anymore.  "Ah yes, he was probably asked to leave for nefarious reasons."  In the oil patch we used to talk about the golden handcuffs, now we discuss the fur handcuffs.
877 2018-03-26 22:01:06 Overthrow the elite ruling class through employee acquisition of enterprise...not forced wealth redistribution. The richest people on earth are not oil barons who got money from their parents and never worked. Classic liberalism has made a class of new money in tech industries
878 2018-03-26 22:00:58 U.S. Firm McDermott to Bid for $5 billion in Asia Offshore Oil, Gas Contracts
879 2018-03-26 22:00:50 Him much of that GDP do think actually goes to Alberta or Canada. The answer is very little. Why do you think income and wealth inequality have reached levels never experienced anyone alive today? Wake up oil lovers. The barons could care less about you and your jobs
880 2018-03-26 22:00:41 #Scotnight Any reason why you gave economic and employment stats for fishing and agriculture, but not the oil and gas sector?
881 2018-03-26 22:00:29 おーっす！はよー！今日も頑張ろーぜ！
882 2018-03-26 22:00:21 Get an essential oil bracelet (or necklace)  and put peppermint oil in it
883 2018-03-26 22:00:02 Actually that is the best use of a military today; to protect own citizens instead fighting oil wars.
884 2018-03-26 21:59:54 tea tree oil really helps me with spots if u havent tried it!!
885 2018-03-26 21:59:49 'Old white OIL GUY' get it right :)
886 2018-03-26 21:59:47 TBH, i honestly WAS wondering what to do with a gifted bottle of grapeseed oil sitting on the counter next to the hair dryer.
887 2018-03-26 21:59:29 I remember buying Snake Oil from him last year in Tijuana.
888 2018-03-26 21:59:27 Your hero’s catastrophic response to 9/11 left a legacy of death, violence & conflict across the Mid East that the region - and the world has yet to emerge from. By no means solely his fault, but his disastrous decisions were like pouring oil onto a fire.  Brilliant leader
889 2018-03-26 21:59:00 i made this sugar scrub for my lips bc theyve been dry as hell but it’s just sugar olive oil honey and vanilla extract so now i can’t stop eating it
890 2018-03-26 21:58:49 I have a feeling a lot of it is money laundering. Especially when you start looking at the sources. There is a lot of Saudi oil money that flows through the bay.
891 2018-03-26 21:58:37 dish soap and olive oil (to keep the brushes soft).
892 2018-03-26 21:58:34 "also fuck applebees" - @ligaratus, 2018, oil on canvas
893 2018-03-26 21:58:21 Yeah, but it’s nice to have food on the table and oil for the furnace... lol.  We single girls have to take care of ourselves...
894 2018-03-26 21:57:55 if you don't have a cat, eucalyptus/peppermint oil diluted with something like coconut oil or a carrier oil rubbed onto the chest/neck/behind the ears can help decongest your sinuses and throat 
895 2018-03-26 21:57:55 Neither it is a type of oil mixed with almond pulp and water. Suggestion read container then throw away before using.
896 2018-03-26 21:57:53 Guess who was using coconut oil to shave, and it was completely liquid cos the bathroom was warm, and then knocked over the pot creating an oil death trap?
897 2018-03-26 21:57:36 Nope. I’m not into the glitter oil stuff but I I know this means more body beauty is coming so I’m with it. Has she ever released a perfume?
898 2018-03-26 21:57:33 I really don't get how tone deaf the OU board of regents can be in appointing a former oil executive as President ahead of the April 2 walkout. No higher ed experience.  I mean I can name about 15 people more qualified than him #OU14Pres
899 2018-03-26 21:57:33 Thank Goodness for og kush topped with sour d oil lmfao !!!
900 2018-03-26 21:57:31 Couldn't agree more.  It's dull, at least AI is no better than Top Player level max.  The only problem we had was when someone lag hacked us and obvs the AI was fine and waltzed past our defenders as they turned like oil tankers in cement.
901 2018-03-26 21:57:16 spent 3 hours at the fucking shop today getting an oil change and if you think youre going to bribe me with 'a free car wash inside and outside"........ you are absolutely right, thank you so much, wonderful service, see you next time
902 2018-03-26 21:56:47 @jiffylube trying to upsell up the ass.. I ONLY NEED AN OIL CHANGE BRO! That’s it !! 
903 2018-03-26 21:56:41 Some people don't know what lye soap is, they don't remember cod liver oil either, nor do they know Coke used to be sold in pharmacies as a drink. That might tell you how old I am. I did learn respect for my elders though.
904 2018-03-26 21:56:37 Remember when fish oil spread terrigen on Agents of SHIELD?
905 2018-03-26 21:56:30 Millions of people in 800+ marches around the world are asking for the same change you call "snake oil".
906 2018-03-26 21:56:27 Libya was not a humanitarian effort it was a direct effort to  dismantle a Stable but powerful state that opposed US dominance viathe petrodollar  .Hence smash the regime then walk away , except Halliburton got the oil contracts just like in Iraq .
907 2018-03-26 21:56:23 Love my job, wake up do oil changes, tires, and be some tech little bitch living the life 
908 2018-03-26 21:56:22 Blanc & Merlot: present honey mustard pretzels, Brown & olive oil crackers, gourmet selections of all to the best wishes. This fun gift
909 2018-03-26 21:56:11 Putting another order in this week bro. I need the beard oil, shampoo and the peppermint smelling shit
910 2018-03-26 21:55:58 nilagyan ni baby ang paa mo ng baby oil? hahahaha
911 2018-03-26 21:55:48 “Birth control is bad for you! Research what goes into your body!” - People who put coconut oil on their face.
912 2018-03-26 21:55:33 this waterproof mascara is coated omg. WILL COCONUT OIL WORK IN TAKING IT OFF
913 2018-03-26 21:55:23 Looking for like minded patriots that support President Trump #MAGA
914 2018-03-26 21:55:17 Mmm. Sea water. Home to so many wonderful creatures. A giver of life and actually quite good for the skin! We wonder why you wouldn’t want them hosed down with some dirty type of liquid like maybe.. oil. That would show em! 
915 2018-03-26 21:55:04 haha ... First, the West should apologize for killing millions of Muslims. Just because they wanted to own oil and mineral wealth of these people
916 2018-03-26 21:55:01 I have a wooden comb that I use to keep it detangled. Wood is great because it allows you to keep the beard clean without stripping your own natural oils. I never use soap.

I’d love to give an oil recommendation but I haven’t found the one for me yet.
917 2018-03-26 21:54:54 He's sad because Popeye stole Olive Oil back
918 2018-03-26 21:54:53 Either sborting oil or  plug dirty or AVR malfunctioning
919 2018-03-26 21:54:49 He got to much baby oil on lmfaoo
920 2018-03-26 21:54:39 lee bien, luego opina
921 2018-03-26 21:54:34 @realDonaldTrump the black people need your help for africa  to give natural resources to blacks in this land America..the gold oil and diamond's blacks need their share from home
922 2018-03-26 21:54:22 I got green chili olive oil all over my favorite white shirt. How’s your day going? 
923 2018-03-26 21:54:17 What do you think Russia involvement in Syria is all about?
Making sure that competition from #Mid_East cannot build a competing pipeline over Syrian land to provide second supplier of Natural Gas to Europe
Russia's main source of revenue is Oil & Gas & a monopoly on pipeline
924 2018-03-26 21:54:17 うんうん^^*
925 2018-03-26 21:54:08 Can you imagine the stink if several million had been murdered by the Muslims in response to a false flag & dodgy as can be 'intelligence'. It's so obviously about resources, oil & power as to not even be worth mentioning. Anyone not getting this are either complicit or dumb as.
926 2018-03-26 21:54:05 fun fact about me: I love pasta drizzled with olive oil and some chopped clinatro.
927 2018-03-26 21:53:53 That is the supposed amount given to Scots because of oil resources
928 2018-03-26 21:53:51 うんうん
929 2018-03-26 21:53:46 North Sea Oil or Brent Crude as it is known is a benchmark in terms of quality, similar to Bonny Crude ( Nigeria) ex Shell management employee
930 2018-03-26 21:53:46 Only use like a drop though otherwise your shit will get greasy and the oil will take aaaaages to come out properly
931 2018-03-26 21:53:01 It’s really so nice fried can I put it in the oven though? That way not too much oil is absorbed? Like oven baked potatoes?
932 2018-03-26 21:52:36 “I’m going to explain feminism to you. First you put grapeseed oil on it…”
933 2018-03-26 21:52:29 End 5: Oil City 6, Titusville 0
934 2018-03-26 21:52:29 This is the Jubilee!
 Are yall ready?
Righteous is walking away from it all. 
Family, Food, air, water, Our Creator, Mother Earth

No more phones, straightners, cars, oil is our himan ancestors 
Feel guilty now!!!
935 2018-03-26 21:52:23 I don’t think so tbh I just use whatever oil I can find 
936 2018-03-26 21:52:01 I've had a brain wave of an idea for tomorrow night's tea! Chicken and pasta tossed through Broighter Gold Lemon rapeseed oil and topped with Scott's original crispy onions! @seasugarsweets @broightergold @crispyonionsNI #Drooling #FastFood #healthydinner
937 2018-03-26 21:51:58 I took your advice and rubbed my chicken in grapeseed oil but it’s still frozen and the skin isn’t crispy and I think I chipped a tooth what did I do wrong?
938 2018-03-26 21:51:57 Every time I want to read hs again I remember that the good parts have been soiled with hands and oil
939 2018-03-26 21:51:28 your face.]] 

Damn. That’s gonna bruise. [[He held out a hand regardless of the oil covering your own.]] 

My cars out front. Just wondered if you’d give it the once over? Check engine light came on for the tenth time this week.
940 2018-03-26 21:51:24 Its a smoother thinner smoke and the oil makes the high better
941 2018-03-26 21:51:23 《オリーブ油豆知識》
オリーブ油は オレイン酸が腸の刺激を促してくれるため、便秘解消効果がある
942 2018-03-26 21:51:15 Someone needs to tell her no one uses the oil paint effect filters for this reason.
943 2018-03-26 21:51:13 Missing the gym for an oil change 
944 2018-03-26 21:51:06 Big oil probably gave him a $2 certificate and now he thinks he has a science degree. Make America Gullible Again.
945 2018-03-26 21:51:05 I have another for you: hydrophilic means it’s water soluble. Hydrophobic is not water soluble (Ex: oil) so is water hydrophilic?
946 2018-03-26 21:51:05 Limeades from sonic and a bubble bath with lavender oil 
947 2018-03-26 21:51:02 Wasn't there supposed to be some sort of investigation on this?? I think the whole province should be compensated with a class action against the government and oil companies. Lots of $$$ owed to the consumers for being robbed over the many many many years.
948 2018-03-26 21:51:00 #NowThatWinterIsOver I won't have to chit chat with oil delivery guy every three f%cking weeks.
949 2018-03-26 21:50:36 Corn waffles and green yellow parfait with chopped tan olive oil wrapped in cold water
950 2018-03-26 21:50:22 I am sure Platts makes valuable research for real oil traders, but unfortunutely today this valuable information were ignored by futures market for some reason. I ignored it too waiting for confirmation from RTS or BBG which did not follow and it had zero impact on price.
951 2018-03-26 21:50:07 With oil changes taking no longer than 30min, we can have you up and going in no time. #gillexpress #truckrepair #truckwash
952 2018-03-26 21:50:06 Ya Allah give me ability to pass this test you are inflicting upon me,InshaAllah you'll find me among the patient
953 2018-03-26 21:50:04 Thank you! Now to finally order coconut oil without feeling guilty aha
954 2018-03-26 21:49:57 Between this Indian healing clay mask, vitamin e oil, rosehip oil, and microdermabrasion facials... my summer time skin is about to be fucking amazing.
955 2018-03-26 21:49:41 @bastilledan are you planning on taking reorchestrated to North America?
956 2018-03-26 21:49:41 I...I bet you could make some killer brownies with vanilla peanut oil <_<;;;
957 2018-03-26 21:49:39 Got into a heated argument with this guy because he couldn't understand that because another service center can't do an oil change on his car we are not liable to cover any of it. It's also been half a year ago and he wanted a refund for OUR service
958 2018-03-26 21:49:34 I wouldn’t be surprised if there is some connection between the climate denial biz (heartland,CEI,Watts, etc) and Mercer/CA/Russia.  Remember, Russia has a LOT of oil they’d like to sell.
959 2018-03-26 21:49:25 Ima go home and soak my bearded in almond oil
960 2018-03-26 21:49:17 Drink hot groundnut oil
961 2018-03-26 21:49:17 Ladies please am going through the #TheBoobMovement and am not seeing alot of boobs moving !  
Just a bunch of horny guys with memes and baby oil 
962 2018-03-26 21:49:16 saturate and swirl them in an oil first (olive oil, veg oil, literally any oil) and then wash with your normal brush soap. that always lifts stains out of my brushes. :)
963 2018-03-26 21:49:15 He is not the only one allocated oil block dubiously, if that's your problem your cup of tea. But our lives are precious to us here in MB.
964 2018-03-26 21:49:15 Overheard by me right now in a shuttle car in Calgary. 
Driver: How are you doing today? Lady: Good. Very busy today!
Driver: You clearly don’t work in oil and gas. #AlbertaConvos
965 2018-03-26 21:48:48 It’s all well and good how smooth coconut oil makes your skin feel, but I’m slipping on carpet here I’m that oily 
966 2018-03-26 21:48:44 So it only ended with the agreement that future (that is not bright) will benefit from further stealing of the country's greatest resource: oil money.

Dear Bill, these people don't care. They have never and will never.

Hope you enjoyed the jollof from the wedding though?
967 2018-03-26 21:48:14 I was so excited!!! But try as I might, I couldn't get the oil mixed properly back in with the peanutbutter so I had toast with a dry, crumbly vanilla-ish paste topped with oil and it wasn't ideal.
968 2018-03-26 21:48:00 Psa for dumb people like me: do not expose your fresh baby winter skin to Miami sun with 10 spf dark tanning oil for 5 hours
969 2018-03-26 21:47:48 I just don’t get all the hype for glossier, it just looks like you rubbed oil all over your face 
970 2018-03-26 21:47:34 Olive oil and salt under the broiler. Easy and yummy.
971 2018-03-26 21:47:25 As for your sarcastic “ethical”...research how many other oil producing nations have a carbon tax and a environmental approval process as touch as Canada? energy companies have pulled capital spending in Canada and moved them elsewhere because of these environmental regulations
972 2018-03-26 21:46:57 It’s the oil they fill their speakers with to make sure you can’t understand anything they say. Gonna need to patch that one.
973 2018-03-26 21:46:57 "Oops, time to refill the oil." (Flame Man, MM&B CD Data)
974 2018-03-26 21:46:53 No nades or C4. I would steal choppers and kamikaze them into targets, use oil barrels, etc....

In some story missions, I allowed use of explosive arrows for otherwise impossible areas (like shooting down helicopters when I had zero other options)
975 2018-03-26 21:46:48 Bulletproof coffees, titanium teas, matcha lattes, maca lattes, insta coffee, ANYTHING (yes I’m a nerd who travels with coconut oil & stuff to!)
976 2018-03-26 21:46:47 I can imagine him sitting comfortably on oil blocks destined for you & kindred. How many arms has he bought for his children?
977 2018-03-26 21:46:47 Me: Damn I need to get my oil changed.
*Drives past three Valvolines in ten minutes.*
Me: HMMMM SHOULD REALLY DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT, HUH.
978 2018-03-26 21:46:35 Why are we ok with shipping our oil overseas instead of supplying ourselves?
979 2018-03-26 21:46:16 Baby oil or cocoanut oil
980 2018-03-26 21:46:11 Мне понравилось видео "The Truth About Fish Oil & Omega 3 ALA/DHA/EPA Vegan Sources | Dr. Milton Mills"
981 2018-03-26 21:45:57 water, dish soap & anti bacterial soap, sometimes a drop of oil but rarely
982 2018-03-26 21:45:42 They were right years ago. The difference between my model brand new and used w/ ~30k was about $1500-2000. The oil changes (full synthetic), car washes, and tires for life I got pay for that 30k within that 30k.
983 2018-03-26 21:45:40 do not throw it out - oil works good in most animal feeds
984 2018-03-26 21:45:36 Do you acknowledge the 97% scientific consensus on climate change? If not, how much the Koch brothers pay you? Are you too scared to stand up to big oil or do you just like being their lap poodle?
985 2018-03-26 21:45:02 1) I regularly roll up the sleeves of my jacket for quick tasks - check oil, swapping pc components, tire change, etc.

2) They make suits and blazers in linen for a reason...
986 2018-03-26 21:44:47 There's a lot to be said for proper soap in bars rather than this palm oil dependent liquid stuff.
987 2018-03-26 21:44:46 I was amazing!!! i'm in these shorts the beige idk i get castor oil for this morn while waiting at the dumbest thing lol
988 2018-03-26 21:44:42 Thank you!  I think it’s gotten worst cause i didn’t bring the vitamin c oil I started using.  I should try sunflower oil as well sha
989 2018-03-26 21:44:36 Yeah, absolutely! There are directions for cleaning and re-using coconut oil in my book on page 189. <3
990 2018-03-26 21:44:21 Liberals point to 2006 as proof they can win midterms, but the district lines were about even back then. The climate was actually even, but they won by running 'moderate' snake oil salesmen in conservative districts.

This year, they're running progressives & the map isn't even.
991 2018-03-26 21:44:15 Funny thing is Norwegian-Americans are fairly happy, too... without being an oil state.
992 2018-03-26 21:44:12 CBD oil has been such a life saver as far as the physiological symptoms that go along with my anxiety are concerned. I love this planet, she’s so sweet.

1000 2018-03-26 21:42:37 My son worked in a start up company that turned coagulated, emulsion of nut oil (from milking almonds, however that occurs) into something roughly resembling cheese. It's a big hit. I'm thankful he finally moved on and started making REAL CHEESE out of real milk.

1002 2018-03-26 21:42:20 What, did the price of heating oil smuggled from just go up?!
1003 2018-03-26 21:42:19 Pro cooking tip: If you stir a little coconut oil into your kale it makes it easier to scrape into the garbage.
1004 2018-03-26 21:42:06 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
1005 2018-03-26 21:42:06 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1006 2018-03-26 21:41:50 Contrary to popular belief of my stupid fuckin neurologist, cbd oil is, in fact, “real” lol anyways fuck that guy
1007 2018-03-26 21:41:46 Compromise will never bring about mastery. I refused to compromise and that’s why you have Smitty’s Beard Oil. Check us out.
1008 2018-03-26 21:41:42 Yeah, but its defensive fortifications are much better than a 2 bedroom in the Bay Area. You can hold more archers, and the extra stories increase the splash of burning oil.

1013 2018-03-26 21:40:53 Going to try this! My husband is PR and cooks AMAZINGLY but with soooo much oil that one could swim in it! I’m going to try it this way and I bet he will love it.

1018 2018-03-26 21:40:13 This is also the same province that imports foreign oil rather than use Alberta oil, we are so tired of their whining.
1019 2018-03-26 21:40:11 The Final Fantasy XV hate train is basically in need of an oil change.

1026 2018-03-26 21:39:16 Nationalizing an industry, like oil, with RICO would be easier than buyout but would take down many politicians, too. If this were the track, scrapping industry would make more sense for the companies in receivership.

Why would the US do this when the military uses the most oil?
1027 2018-03-26 21:39:07 Now that the weather is getting slightly warmer, I have to rethink this makeup thing all over again. Even with the primer, powder & the setting spray, I gotta get a hang of this oil on my face.
1028 2018-03-26 21:39:05 Every municipality in Canada has evolved from open pit dump sites and flushing toilets into local waterways including your own. Victoria has been doing something about their problem. Deflecting this to be about that isn't selling oil tankers and oil spills any better for you!
1029 2018-03-26 21:39:01 Shale oil isn't close to the same quality as crude. North sea production cost now around $12 per barrel.
Crude oil from the north sea is used in over 6000 different products.
Still around 30years worth & new fields still to tested off the west coast.
1030 2018-03-26 21:38:59 Trim myself (when I trim), I use #GraveBeforeShave oil/balm.

1035 2018-03-26 21:38:35 @BraveTart Can you reuse coconut oil when frying? I'm not sure how the cleaning process would go as it solidifies

1041 2018-03-26 21:38:03 Jeter & Sherman are snake oil salesmen! Mas would’ve been waay better!

1046 2018-03-26 21:37:27 I don’t understand people who let their lips get chapped to the point it’s super noticeable.. LIKE FUCKING DEAL WITH THAT SHIT . (p.s coconut oil works wonders!)
1047 2018-03-26 21:37:22 Queen coming to end the goat who can't sing aka Canola Oil
1048 2018-03-26 21:37:21 I don't know why all these US Army/Oil memes are suddenly popping up (seems like these should have become more a thing a decade ago) but I love them!
1049 2018-03-26 21:37:18 I go back and forth on the butter and coconut oil trying to decide which I like better
1050 2018-03-26 21:37:08 the us didn’t even know we existed and no one cared about alaska until they figured out it had natural resources (gold and eventually oil)
1051 2018-03-26 21:36:45 I like churning the peanut oil back into the peanut butter jar for some reason
1052 2018-03-26 21:36:40 West wants to control the middle East by having influence on whoever has more power in that region. They are not helping you here. It's divide and rule policy. Alas!! Many people are just too naive to see the obvious. Having control over oil is the ultimate goal here.
1053 2018-03-26 21:36:32 And the oil keeps burning. He keeps trimming the candles, so that none of candles give out smoke.
1054 2018-03-26 21:36:27 Put another way too, arson victim sues oil company for gasoline used to burn down house.
1055 2018-03-26 21:36:18 What about beard oil?
1056 2018-03-26 21:36:09 On September 24, 2000, Saddam Hussein allegedly “emerged from a meeting of his government and proclaimed that Iraq would soon transition its oil export transactions to the euro currency.”
1057 2018-03-26 21:35:50 My grandparents all smoked and baked themselves under the sun slathered in baby oil - doesn’t mean I would do it myself, and if I had a large platform, I certainly wouldn’t tell others to do it.
1058 2018-03-26 21:35:45 Vitamin E oil, it helps sooooo much!
1059 2018-03-26 21:35:15 I do a cup of kibble and a cup of homemade then 2 squirts salmon oil (morning and night). I have big dogs so I am not ready for the total cost of homemade feeding but this balances out

1064 2018-03-26 21:35:03 Oh damn! I got a thing that makes all the truffles I pick up have purple stars so they sell for more than truffle oil
1065 2018-03-26 21:35:03 Think we should ban hot oil
1066 2018-03-26 21:34:40 Armageddon: US Proxy Forces are all in place. Turkey is in Syria cutting out their chunk, US has their chunk cut out. All on oil rich areas...The only thing stopping EU/US from seizing Damascus is Russia. That is why the false flag came up for nerve gas blamed on Russia. A Set-up
1067 2018-03-26 21:34:35 terrorism is not the main reason they are deployed. Oil is.

1069 2018-03-26 21:34:20 From behind a plain metal door, you hear a haunting chorus. An oil lamp lies discarded nearby.
1070 2018-03-26 21:33:52 I would totally do my own oil change but I’ve been spoiled w/ a lift so now I’m just going to take my shit to a shop. Do not miss my long ass arms underneath the car trying to maneuver shit on a jack stand. 
1071 2018-03-26 21:33:50 I note that brand, Best Foods, has recently replaced the soy oil with canola.
We'll see what happens.
1072 2018-03-26 21:33:48 Yap that’s what we were afraid of, need to have oil tank replaced though and that will be expensive 
1073 2018-03-26 21:33:41 Mayb the 2 stroke oil for the generator
1074 2018-03-26 21:33:19 Well. The answer is right there in Ali's story. Saudi Arabia's money. We talk about Big Oil all the freakin' time. Well Saudi Arabia is the biggest oil in the world! And what has it been doing with that money since 1980? Turning every mosque in the world into book pumping Sharia.
1075 2018-03-26 21:33:03 Finally the first soap I made is ready to use and OMG it feels amazing. Olive oil and Coconut oil 
1076 2018-03-26 21:32:45 Yes absolutely amazing. I use a few different combinations of marinades but tonight’s was sriracha, tamari soy sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, apple cider vinegar and a little rapeseed oil! 
1077 2018-03-26 21:32:28 Then he tried to use some fancy lingo about oil and transmissions to confuse me because apparently women know nothing about cars...I told him never mind and he gets mad at me like I am wasting his time..well Fuck you kyle& your 70 dollar oil change. Ill do it my Damn self lol
1078 2018-03-26 21:32:21 Sitting at Pennzoil and the dude changing my oil is screaming bohemian rapsody #imdying 
1079 2018-03-26 21:32:13 Knew i needed an oil change. Thrilled to know it's prob burning oil.
1080 2018-03-26 21:32:10 @DrJaninaRamirez Anticipating with dread your new project for BBC4 featuring Baku, a city rooted in monstrous historical lie and heinous crime of pogrom and ethnic cleansing. I guess none of that crept up as you were filming - caviar diplomacy in action no doubt, oil money!
1081 2018-03-26 21:32:04 I don't know how long I've been on the ground but I just woke up on my living room floor with my hands covered in oil so I'm assuming I fainted
1082 2018-03-26 21:31:44 Went to get my oil changed today at my local jiffy lube....told the guy what I wanted and he goes well that's gonna be 67 dollars plus tax.....I said now what did you just say?
1083 2018-03-26 21:31:17 How about a background check on her so called "shampoo"?  Looks like there is enough oil and grease to scare OPEC.
1084 2018-03-26 21:31:02 I, too, had my oil changed. But it wasn’t this good

1088 2018-03-26 21:30:24 Do not think that love, in order to be genuine, has to be extraordinary. . . . How does a lamp burn? Through the continuous input of small drops of oil. . . . What are these drops of oil in our lamps? They are the small things of daily life - Mother Theresa
1089 2018-03-26 21:30:22 I love Black Jamaican Castor Oil.

1095 2018-03-26 21:29:59 We could have all the natural resources in the world but it means nothing if you can’t make money from it. N sea oil way more expensive than shale oil, so if price climbs US will up production. Move to green tech means reducing demand too.
1096 2018-03-26 21:29:52 If staining shirts with olive oil is a crime, throw me in the slammer and destroy the key.

1099 2018-03-26 21:29:41 Now with the Iran Nuclear Deal in jeopardy, the oil markets are starting to signal the "return of the geopolitical risk premium." #IranDeal
1100 2018-03-26 21:29:41 @GreenAlien_420wow some people are so against the oil companies but if you use a vehicle it's ok, I mean I'm just a crazy oil field hand

1102 2018-03-26 21:29:25 Yazi you should have flown. Brooms are faster, they don't need oil or tires 
1103 2018-03-26 21:29:24 Don't forget the tower of oil and the chariot race!!!!
1104 2018-03-26 21:29:22 This is how you know Trump gives zero f*cks about the military (smart people already knew that) and he's just a fat ass smarmy racist adulterer snake oil salesman with incest/pedophilia tendencies. The Trump regime is a swampy cesspool of disgusting degenerates and criminals.
1105 2018-03-26 21:29:09 I read sometime ago about this plant base plastic and as far as I remember correct it is not biodegradable, so maybe is better than oil based because is not degrading into micro pices which are swollowed by fish but still can get into oceans and pollute it.
1106 2018-03-26 21:29:08 Only losers in this story. Parents for losing their daughter, thinking their faith requires this behavior. Their daughter for being forced to marry but after refusing the husband have hot oil poured on her.
1107 2018-03-26 21:28:55 Mine was in the same spot and it felt so nice to rub coconut oil on it! Hopefully the sunburn feeling goes away soon
1108 2018-03-26 21:28:36 I kinda agree but it's not exactly consumers wanting to rely on oil, it's the large companies that have all the money pushing it on the consumer. If research was done and electric cars became as practical as gas, I assume they would sell much better
1109 2018-03-26 21:28:17 What do you say when the mechanic who does your car oil change compliments your backseat goat collection? NOTHING APPARENTLY

1113 2018-03-26 21:27:23 Any day now they’re gonna finish the audit and Trump will release his taxes, right?

Cuz I’m super interested in seeing if he has money invested in or against aluminum, steel, coal, oil, foreign properties/ corporations, weapons manufacturers, Russia, McDonalds & anything else...
1114 2018-03-26 21:26:51 Watching who wants to be a millionaire while waiting for my oil change with other people waiting and we’re all having such good laughs together 
1115 2018-03-26 21:26:35 Thank you Sen. Rubio. 

Please feel free to push for a total oil blockade to Venezuelas oil shipments to US since the regime is using that cash to substain it self with no aid to Venezuelan ppl. 

We Will Prevail but time is essential.
1116 2018-03-26 21:26:34 But I fear for Europe if Putin goes nuts and turns off the oil & gas taps.
1117 2018-03-26 21:26:19 Again, there is no such thing as sustainable palm oil. 
Palm oil is a killer and need to be boycotted.

1119 2018-03-26 21:26:13 I wonder what they had to say about the ACTUAL Nazis that are marching through this nation, terrorizing and killing innocents? Ah, nothing I see. Because they all voted Trump. 

As a devout Christian, I never watch televangelists because they're generally snake oil salesmen.
1120 2018-03-26 21:26:09 Dawn or zote & olive oil.
1121 2018-03-26 21:25:59 I agree.

1140 2018-03-26 21:23:01 Yes, carbs are a problem without a doubt for teeth and gums. I mentioned the seed oil connection because I found it surprising, and there's some support in the lit.

1142 2018-03-26 21:22:46 I just baked them in the oven with some olive oil and the rest of the cauliflower. They're lovely and sweet.
1143 2018-03-26 21:22:19 Not a mechanic though but try check the oil ma'am

1145 2018-03-26 21:22:10 Permits are not a hurdle they are simply part of the process

#MATD will imo get permits required & on time, why?

1. Permits granted previously

2. Gov. requires energy independence

3. Indian $1billion O&G infrastructure loan

4. New Oil supply needed to fill Refinery capacity

1147 2018-03-26 21:21:51 DR Congo has gold, diamonds, oil and cobalt, hence our major contribution to aid and fighting the local "terrorists" who want those resources for themselves. #BBCNews
1148 2018-03-26 21:21:27 OMG! I'm in love! The model is pretty okay too.
1149 2018-03-26 21:21:24 -333 kbpd should move oil price at least 1,5-2 dollars up like with north sea and canadian pipeline leak and maintenance situations, but it did not. It could be due to 1. algos are feeded with news from RTS and BBG only and 2. they has no copy right to duplicate Platts news.
1150 2018-03-26 21:21:13 Basically wwe suckling at the teet of the oil rich barons, it'll be a 50 man royal rumble, basically full card of SD and Raw maybe some NXT
1151 2018-03-26 21:21:02 No is that oil though? Cause I’m starting to think oil doesn’t agree with me 
1152 2018-03-26 21:20:54 It seems pitting Canadians against Canadians is somehow a great idea. I wonder who came up with this brainstorm?? Canadian produced oil should trump all others.
1153 2018-03-26 21:20:44 Healthy- baked chickpeas w/ olive oil ,garlic, and chili powder.
Unhealthy- Everything Bagel Chips. SO BAD, but so good. Lol
1154 2018-03-26 21:20:38 Really? Then why would we go to war, for anything, if not to keep what we have? Whether it’s about terrorists, oil, land or cyber, it’s all about protecting America’s beliefs contained in the Constitution.
1155 2018-03-26 21:20:31 The climate conference choose not to talk about container ships the biggest producers of CO2. One large ship equals 50 million cars. There are 100,000 ships in the world they build 3,000 ships a year 85 % of saudi oil fuels container ships the green taxes will have no effect
1156 2018-03-26 21:20:24 don't even engage, this is homeopathic woo crystal healing through the power of MLM essential oil bullshit
1157 2018-03-26 21:20:20 I need some oil in a squirt bottle to be doused all through my head cuz my scalp is tight 
1158 2018-03-26 21:20:14 Possibly. 
I started taking hemp oil last week (got it in Shoprite) , teaspon a day and maybe its a placebo effect but i think my mind is more clear.  Plus it tastes better than fishy oil. ;)
1159 2018-03-26 21:20:14 Cantu oil mist, shea moisture curl activating cream and bounce curl it’s been my routine for a while I’m afraid to switch it up
1160 2018-03-26 21:20:13 Reason #1 I hardly ever cook in my tiny, old apartment: the slightest bit of smoke from the stove sets the smoke alarm off. If olive oil starts to smoke even slightly, I'm subjected to ear-piercing shrieks.
1161 2018-03-26 21:20:09 tell me why i just typed oial instead of oil
1162 2018-03-26 21:20:04 heavy oil is projected to be in high demand with other Heavy oil producing nations (Venezuela) having political issues as well as an increasing demand (asphalt/plastic). Your theory suggests Pepsi should have never entered the market because Coke already produced enough
1163 2018-03-26 21:19:58 I need 10 oil presses
1164 2018-03-26 21:19:56 Oil! Sunflower, or vitamin c oil
1165 2018-03-26 21:19:48 Everybody having kids and I still need my dad to be otp with me when I go get a oil change 
1166 2018-03-26 21:19:46 If you look back through history, almost every major conflict starts over a limited resource. Oil being the single biggest resource people fight over today
1167 2018-03-26 21:19:21 I was about to buy some shimmer body oil from someone else. But Rihanna comes first
1168 2018-03-26 21:19:08 Getting A Oil change today!!!  LMFAO!!!  It's Funny if you know what I'm talking about.
1169 2018-03-26 21:19:02 tmw someone tries to tell you that lavender oil will magically erase all symptoms of endometriosis and you grab the lavender oil in the hopes that its soothing properties will calm your violent impulses toward the person who said that
1170 2018-03-26 21:19:01 What's your favorite cosmetic oil of all times? Argan, Coconut, Avacado, Almond, Macadamia, Jojoba, Grapeseed, Moringa, Apricot Kernal, Castor, Babassu, Black seed, Neem, Help seed, Rosehip, Flax seed, Emu, Tamanu????? so many choices!
1171 2018-03-26 21:18:57 Just rubbed essential peppermint oil into my eye. Do not recommend.
1172 2018-03-26 21:18:55 How @rihanna know I was running out of hoe oil?! Her mind.
1173 2018-03-26 21:18:53 Thanks dollface! Hoping this eye issue goes away soon. -_- I can't afford seeing a specialist or having an oil gland cut out of my eyelid. The arm will heal on its own.
1174 2018-03-26 21:18:18 See??? More oil derived synthetic materials keeping the delicate creatures warm.
1175 2018-03-26 21:18:09 Excuse me im not paying you to fuss me for not changing my oil..... i didn’t ask for any extra services. i just asked for an oil change so get busy thank u
1176 2018-03-26 21:18:08 $75 oil change  see I need to call my dad bc this seems suspect
1177 2018-03-26 21:18:00 Why just Islay. As with oil, or land buyouts why not for Scotland?
1178 2018-03-26 21:17:48 @NYCMayor Have you two not realised that oil and gas consumption are set to rise up to 2040 and probably beyond. Smarter people than you will be happy to invest.
1179 2018-03-26 21:17:30 Will be difficult to triple-count billions of RMB in cash counting machines, then transport them in suitcases to oil producing nations.

1182 2018-03-26 21:17:05 . . . we wilted some wild garlic leaves down in a gobi aloo tonight, instead of the ‘sag’! They make a great ‘pesto’ too, with pine nuts, olive oil and parmesan, (plus the ubiquitous wild garlic mash!), they’re v versatile!
1183 2018-03-26 21:17:04 we could be brothers
1184 2018-03-26 21:17:02 Televangelist are NOT Religious.. they are snake oil salesmen selling to the gullible using a Bible with many pages missing!
1185 2018-03-26 21:16:58 @CNN A POLL FROM BOBBLE HEAD SNAJE OIL SALESPEOPLE?? WHO CARES!!!!!!!
1186 2018-03-26 21:16:48 the history of the last 100 years=wars for oil on indigenous land. This has to end. #ClimateJustice
1187 2018-03-26 21:16:43 The oil you are talking about has been stolen from the countries invaded so you aren't protecting your assets you are stealing someone else's at gun point. Good night.
1188 2018-03-26 21:16:39 How can someone’s interest be “beard oil” tho
1189 2018-03-26 21:16:27 Good to hear. Now just start building the damn thing. Sick of outrageous gas prices and environmentalists clad in their finest oil derived protective gear and gasoline powered generators protesting this. Their hypocrisy makes me sick.
1190 2018-03-26 21:16:27 axel's so nice..! i just hope he doesn't trip over all that oil..;;
1191 2018-03-26 21:16:21 Don’t know if my eyes burn cause I’m tired or cause coconut oil is too close to them
1192 2018-03-26 21:16:02 I respectfully disagree with the amendment. From my conversations with people in my district, though some support I have found far more who do not. I did support making CBD oil legal.

1194 2018-03-26 21:15:26 So expelling Russian "diplomats" and intelligence agents is a nice symbolic gesture. But red-lighting #NordStream2 would be of MUCH greater force and effect, as would a full economic blockade, and a food for oil & gas program.

1202 2018-03-26 21:14:40 OK Tucker...listened to your issue with seed oil and gingivitis and wanted to add my experience. Bleeding gums the last 4 years but very little seed oil.  Bleeding stopped 2 weeks after I went no carbs though...great podcast!! Thanks!!
1203 2018-03-26 21:14:22 Waking up early to get my oil changed before work

1205 2018-03-26 21:14:13 In lieu of a retirement savings plan, I'm going to bring back Snake Oil. Extra-virgin, fresh press, artisanal snake oil. Naturally rich in Omega-3s.
1206 2018-03-26 21:14:12 It's more about Iran than oil. Europe needs gas, hence the support of the Iran deal. Gas pipelines require stability. Iran creates instability. America is allied with Iran's main enemies, Israel and Saudi.
1207 2018-03-26 21:14:05 ohh how many times ive corrected people who say to use tea tree oil or salt water soaks on theirs like.. no.. dont.. pls. Also people get like ENRAGED when you tell them surgical steel is trash??
1208 2018-03-26 21:13:58 And all this in a oil rich country,scandalous
1209 2018-03-26 21:13:55 Facts! Hahaha! Hears a fact! Obama sold out to every corporation that crossed his path including big oil! What happened to that green loving senator Obama? He became big oil’s best friend! What side were you on Mr. Independent??
1210 2018-03-26 21:13:54 @juliemason Trump was NOT against the Iraq war, he only claims to be now. It’s a lie. He also advocated for taking their oil and has increased US presence there.  He’s a hawk, down to the ground.
1211 2018-03-26 21:13:49 This sits in a particularly large & dirty/oil/blood money region of the Military Industrial Swamp-Complex,historically resistant to draining, but the Emiratis’ abetting Russian electoral interference raises possibility of the spec. counsel indictments for felon on the left.

1216 2018-03-26 21:12:24 Loving Argan Oil for our faces! Might have to incorporate it in something new. We've seen it help mature skin as well.
1217 2018-03-26 21:12:19 Well yes we should be using plant based plastics not oil based ...
1218 2018-03-26 21:12:07 Looool I might need small beard oil and 2 months to officially declare that one

1221 2018-03-26 21:11:51 Bloomberg was also more into getting the sports teams brand new stadiums. DeBlasio is not. Unless the oil barons decide to make a deal with the Dolans and build a stadium over MSG, I don't see how it gets done inside the 5 boroughs.
1222 2018-03-26 21:11:51 Or an oil tanker one!
1223 2018-03-26 21:11:39 I was thinking I’m all the way with the moisture shits and put Jamaican black castor oil on my face. Now my face smells like cigarette butts. #playedmyself101

1226 2018-03-26 21:11:11 Not to be dramatic but I owe my life to whoever thought to make oil from coconuts
1227 2018-03-26 21:11:02 Yes...but they could be made of plant based plastics....instead of oil based. But no money in that.

1229 2018-03-26 21:10:53 absolutely. an extension of waste disposal could be separating trash (compost, recyclables, trash). It could be a source of income to recycle and dispose properly... I was just talking to my mum about this the other day, you can make money from used oil

1243 2018-03-26 21:10:04 If only coconut oil could cure depression
1244 2018-03-26 21:09:59 I can sympathise

I once was determined to drain the oil on my motor-bike (we’re talking 1960’s here)

The manual was quite clear “loosen nut A”
..but ‘Nut  A’ wouldn’t budge for love or money

Motor bike long since gone but I’m still here 

I’m trying to get a moral out of that
1245 2018-03-26 21:09:58 Soak in water in the fridge over night before frying to get rid of the excess starch, blanch in 250F oil until limp, then fry in 350F oil until crisp #trust

1252 2018-03-26 21:09:30 You puts the grapeseed oil on the skin or else you get the hose again.
1253 2018-03-26 21:09:07 Also my method also uses oil ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1254 2018-03-26 21:08:59 I’m such an adult. I scheduled my Oil Change and Taxes on Saturday before I go into work.  
1255 2018-03-26 21:08:50 I was just gonna reup on Divine Oil for the body glow but uhh... I might have to see what Fenty talmbout with that body Luminizer. I just might.
1256 2018-03-26 21:08:33 I think castor oil can't overrun genetics. That's the main issue. Oil can help soften the hair and strengthen hair but it can't grow hair somewhere there are no follicles.
1257 2018-03-26 21:08:30 I HEARD ITS A POSSIBILITY THEM “DOCTORS” COULD BE PUTTIN COOKING OIL AND ALL TYPE OF SHIT IN YALL ASS WHEN YALL GET ASS SHOTS...IF SO, YALL NEED TO GO AHEAD AND ASK FOR THAT FADE

1259 2018-03-26 21:08:24 Insisto de que sirve llevar a la quiebra a OIL Combustibles? y con eso llevarán a todas las empresas del Grupo INDALO, la AFIP no cobrará nada y las empresas se las quedaran los CEOS GUBERNAMENTALES por dos mangos. Cualquier parecido con el caso Graiver no es pura coincidencia.
1260 2018-03-26 21:08:13 What a diff a year makes: Oil is up $17/barrel (but not Cdn thanks to pipeline constraints) Gaso is up 45 cents/gallon but C$ has hardly responded- only +4 cts, again thanks to limited pipelines= deep discounts for WCS which is holding back our dollar, costing you more @ the

1262 2018-03-26 21:08:03 Petroleum is actually horrible for your skin. You'd be much better off using coconut oil.
1263 2018-03-26 21:08:01 Burning that midnight oil!
1264 2018-03-26 21:07:55 Checked the oil recently?
1265 2018-03-26 21:07:51 Protein/keratin treatment? Deep condition? Hot oil treatment? But basically you’ve irritated your hair and have to train it to lay/wave again...moisturize, BRUSH BRUSH BRUSH, and tie it down at ALL times you aren’t in public lol
1266 2018-03-26 21:07:36 Welp, Rihanna is launching body oil.... it’s about to get brazy out chea

1270 2018-03-26 21:07:00 under the influence of CBD oil i finished brokeback mountain,cried, cut mats from my fat ass cat’s fur, listened to @DustinOHalloran‘s piano solos vol. 2 album on vinyl (with headphones bc it was 3am),wrote a sad poem about a boy i used to like and made it to sleep before 4:30am.
1271 2018-03-26 21:06:56 that life changing cheese sauce is brilliant, saves a fortune even for proper cheese eaters. and it is quicker to make. My cheat way of doing it, is use powdered potato and coconut oil and spoonful of polish seasoning.
1272 2018-03-26 21:06:51 The only non-mechanical part is a portion of its face. Only eats raw meat soaked in machine oil.
1273 2018-03-26 21:06:50 Also you could buy a lot of $400 hairdryers for the amount of grapeseed oil it takes to roast 250,000 chickens
1274 2018-03-26 21:06:49 There are loads I want to try! Coffee, coconut oil and cocoa is one I’m going to road test.
1275 2018-03-26 21:06:46 I'm not arguing that your way doesn't result in crispy chicken skin. I use oil to get my roast chickens crispy too. But rather than just saying "Oh you do it a different way that requires no oil" you felt the need to assume the OP was unaware of your "better" method.
1276 2018-03-26 21:06:46 @RepBuddyCarter  You say yes to "finding out what's out there" oil exploration off coast of Georgia.

1280 2018-03-26 21:06:24 They’re playing “Who Loves You” (which is one of my favorites) by Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons at the oil change place and it made me happy because I was thinking about Jersey Boys. That was such an amazing memory. I love my papa 
1281 2018-03-26 21:06:12 It’s on your website Snake Oil Joe... surely you have time to update that. I mean you must have a whole team of people keeping up your image.. 
1282 2018-03-26 21:06:09 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
1283 2018-03-26 21:06:07 I would go to sephora and have them test the moisture in your skin bc I thought I was really oily too but actually my skin was dehydrated from all the mattifying products I was using! So it was producing more oil to help combat that!
1284 2018-03-26 21:06:06 If you want to burn some demonic sh*t you have to use some holy oil.
1285 2018-03-26 21:06:00 BC’s Govt agreed to export Tanker Liquid Natural Gas fr Kitamat perhaps protesters could stop those Tankers..or go to the Maritimes were Ontario & Quebec import 670,000 Brls Tanker Oil a Day. fr Saudi Sheiks Russia Columbia Ghana Angola Oman. Burnaby protesters are Ignorant fools
1286 2018-03-26 21:05:41 I'm addicted to #TraderJoes original hawaiian style (kettle cooked) chips and they've been out for weeks.... Olive oil kettle cooked is good too; I need the originals.
1287 2018-03-26 21:05:38 man I don’t like the smell of lotions shit smell terrible that’s why I use coconut oil .
1288 2018-03-26 21:05:38 any recommendations on oil diffusers? like brand wise?
1289 2018-03-26 21:05:32 I have roasted 292,501 chickens and the best way to do it is on a LaserDisc.

Liberally rub your entire body with unreliable olive oil while the LaserDisc is roasting.

One and a half Bronko Nagurski fists of the unreliable olive oil should do the job.
1290 2018-03-26 21:05:28 How did we get here? Matter organises itself. Take a bottle of water, oil, and sand. Shake it up, and then watch. Organisation.
1291 2018-03-26 21:05:28 And coconut oil is the duck fat of vegans I speak truth Darth
1292 2018-03-26 21:05:25 OLIVE OIL: high quality European oils are called finishing oils or salad oils. They are used in salad dressings and drizzled over finished, plated dishes. Never cooked with, the oils lose their delicate bouquets when heated much over 180 degrees F.
1293 2018-03-26 21:05:19 It's the olive oil
1294 2018-03-26 21:05:17 Naw that's only Quebec and east. We just have oil that no one seems to want to buy.
1295 2018-03-26 21:05:17 Same volume of each thing: measure eggs first, then do the same volume of skimmed milk and then flour. Heat oil in tray before adding batter. Oven = 20 mins, DO NOT LOOK UNTIL DONE. Always works.

1298 2018-03-26 21:05:01 There used to be conservative intellectuals. It's  a shame because this country works better when there are two viable parties. The right is no longer conservative in any fashion: mass spending, plunder our oil stores, destroy our environment, start wars, military parades etc.
1299 2018-03-26 21:04:55 It doesnt my g. Oil can't make hair grow in places where no hair can grow. If that is the case then why don't people rub castor oil when they get a drawback.

1303 2018-03-26 21:04:00 "...a sobering reminder that stratospheric growth in renewables is not enough. Renewables put a brake on emissions but they don’t stop coal, oil and gas from being dug out of the ground."

Sounds like a healthy dose of #DIVESTMENT might help here.

1305 2018-03-26 21:03:54 No laughing matter. Here’s it in a nutshell. The world is about to plunge into a dramatic cooling. It’s the sun. It’s shutting down. Russia has all the gas and oil. The west will not survive long without it. TPTB cannot allow Putin to have his hand on the tap. War.
1306 2018-03-26 21:03:47 cod liver oil good for unblocking you..
1307 2018-03-26 21:03:46 This is nothing to putin. A tit for tat. He's asking the people which U.S.. embassy he should close now.  If wh wanted to do any real damage to him, go after their oil, or dbl down on sanctions
1308 2018-03-26 21:03:42 The mechanic just gave me a flower after I dropped $44 for an oil change.

1316 2018-03-26 21:03:00 Britain should save its coal. It will need it in the future. Energy reserves are not as vast as everyone is pretending they are. The KSA pumped over 135 Billion Barrels of Oil. Yet claims it has more oil reserves today, then in 1973. 2020 will be an interesting yr for energy

1319 2018-03-26 21:02:35 OLIVE OIL: why do Food Network stars and other tv "chefs" say cook with extra virgin olive oil? They get paid $1000-1500 every time they say it. Real EVOO costs $35-55/liter. Hardly something ang professional kitchen would destroy by cooking with it. They use trash US quality oil
1320 2018-03-26 21:02:30 sauce: 1 spud, 1 large carrot. chopped up +boiled until dead. Shove through hand blender. Add spoon of marg or coconut oil. Add seasoning. I use polish seasoning and nooch. can use garlic salt, mustard p, smoked paprika etc.

1325 2018-03-26 21:01:17 @TonyMassarotti good oil is hard to find abroad.
1326 2018-03-26 21:00:55 You say yes to "finding out what's out there" oil exploration off coast of Georgia. 
   
Are you concerned the @EPA isn't notifying the people of Houston regarding dozens of toxic leaks from oil companies after Hurricane Harvey?

1330 2018-03-26 21:00:38 US tankers from Alaska have an exemption to use this route. 
There’s a native band who want to run a pipeline through their reserve, into Alaska and use that exemption for Canadian oil too. (Our Lib gov is full of sh**heads.)
1331 2018-03-26 21:00:37 I like how he specified you should roast the chicken first, rub it with oil and salt and put it in the oven afterwards

1339 2018-03-26 20:59:45 Can you imagine the front row union if they knew one of their own was handling olive oil! Far too new age 
1340 2018-03-26 20:59:44 I’m going to get my oil changed today and I already know they gone try to charge me an extra $200 for some bullshit.
1341 2018-03-26 20:59:35 Drinking turpentine oil is good for you because it's natural and organic (it comes from pine trees); and the vomiting, bleeding in the lungs, bloody urine, killed neurons and coma that it causes prove that it's working to cleanse your system of toxins. So keep drinking, Haddish.

1343 2018-03-26 20:59:04 OLIVE OIL: are you aware the majority of extra virgin oils sold in the US could never use that label in Europe where strict standards apply. The US has no such standards. In fact, European olive growers ship sub-standard products to the US to sell for just that reason.
1344 2018-03-26 20:58:55 The money that put him in office, practically invented the #NWO. Those people also want obama to lead the world.. Those people are islam. Make no mistake, as long as there's oil money from the mid-east, there will be obama.

1350 2018-03-26 20:58:25 Make the crust thicker than the rest of the pizza, use an egg wash or olive oil on the outside to help keep it moist inside, Also try cooker for a shorter period of time on a higher temp
1351 2018-03-26 20:58:21 Exactly Greg. Its like an opposition hooker pouring olive oil on the rugby ball before you throw in. Proper cheating.
1352 2018-03-26 20:58:19 Kangin get confused about what to teach Kyu,

-thinly slice precooked chicken (season), heat in the same pan with 3 drops of lime juice
-repeat with mushrooms, onions, scallions etc
-Put all in the

Since 2015 Yemen has had 2 million people displaced by the Saudi/US/Brit coalition for oil and death. 

So when more Muslims show up in your country, you will know who to blame!

Stop the Wars!

1410 2018-03-26 20:49:35 We could start by getting rid of oil drilling in CA, or at least taxing them at a reasonable rate. CA has no extraction tax. How can we claim that our state has some moral authority on climate change when we're still one of the biggest oil producing states in the USA?

1418 2018-03-26 20:48:08 Olive oil and salt, roast 3-4 min tops. Or cut into 2" pieces and quickly sautee with olive oil over high heat. Just stop before it gets mushy, toss in a little of the chicken sauce once off the heat. Also works well with sesame oil if you like that flavor.
1419 2018-03-26 20:48:08 I always wondered if the migration here and in the UK is a STAGED attack my Muslims. Like 'Choreographed' and people like Nancy Pelosi and others who don't have shame who don't believe in karma are hired by the Arabs with oil. As long as 'MY' money doesn't get taken, who cares?
1420 2018-03-26 20:47:57 lemme just say the @ilovepacifica pinapple oil slaying face wash literally saved my skin !! That and the kale multi cream omg my skin has nEVER looked so good
1421 2018-03-26 20:47:39 Can they check for CBD if you use the oil instead?
1422 2018-03-26 20:47:31 Ok, what the hell are Adern and her mates up to, ffs??? Now we have the rich oil magnates buying up permits that aren't for sale. I feel like we've been well- shafted  - did Labour intend this all along?? Come on Greens, get passionate!!!
1423 2018-03-26 20:47:20 I guess bc enjoyed those equalization payments. Do u not have a resolution to this issues like double pipes in very sensitive areas, oil companies need to produce protective barriers for all sources of oil ships,pipes ect environmental issues should be acknowledged.
1424 2018-03-26 20:47:06 I just exfoliated my whole body, shaved, and then moisturised myself with as much coconut oil I could and I feel and smell: amazing

Seriously though, your palm oil posts made a really big difference in my life. I thought I was doing "ok" but really wasn't. Try really hard now with it. Sad to admit it too but the general ethical side has things has changed for the better too

I know it sounds weird, but it's super nummy. 
1436 2018-03-26 20:45:22 Whoa, when did having mental health problems suddenly become the reason not to be able to pass judgement on those passing judgement? To be fair I ain't no oil painting an don't stoop to the level of mentioning people's looks, but just found it ironic that u are is all 
1437 2018-03-26 20:45:21 I like them with oil on a baking sheet and then sprinkle salt and pepper. Nice and crispy

1461 2018-03-26 20:42:59 Just earlier, I applied oil onto my sword so it has great sharpness. If you touch it even slightly, your fingers would be cut and blood could spill.

1473 2018-03-26 20:41:27 We'll need oil for plastics, pains and other things too. But it's not worth opening up new places for drilling. Especially the US coastline.

1492 2018-03-26 20:39:26 I started giving my cats and doggo salmon oil last month. One of the kitties has historically had a dandruff problem and while it's not gone it's noticeably decreased. He's less itchy too, poor guy. I'm working with a vet for proper dosing and all that. 
1493 2018-03-26 20:39:17 I’d have to actually get my oil changed for this to be relevant to me

1496 2018-03-26 20:38:51 Omg. That really does sound disgusting.

1497 2018-03-26 20:38:48 You can do this though, hold it together man. I know it's tough but get you some cbd oil and a high dose at that. I take 66mg every 4hrs, it's a godsend

1509 2018-03-26 20:36:51 Massage coconut oil in circular motions into them for a minute or so each every night. The hair grows back pretty quick imo.
1510 2018-03-26 20:36:50 (( So weird.  I hadn't been thinking of oil drilling specifically, but it was nonetheless going to be an "Orochi exploitation of resources" situation.

1544 2018-03-26 20:32:11 No, more like a distraction point and just used by self interested parties such as big oil companies who would really rather prefer people to not buy electric cars while carefully avoiding the basic truth that they have no real bearing on cobalt consumption.

Democratic Republic of Congo’s 2017 mining sector revenue rose 35.6% to $822.2m while revenue from the oil and gas sector jumped by 103% to $203.9m.
1557 2018-03-26 20:30:55 Page 2 £1 per litre as he has the biggest gas oil Gold fields now then follow the leader go to war he is oneman you lot are a Shower an absolute Showeras it is not silver or gold that runs the world its gas and oil and the Arsewipes have gas and oil yet untapped u r clever no,!!
1558 2018-03-26 20:30:52 I've been told by numerous people (and they might be drug dealers since Canada is trying to go Cannabis legal) ... that Cannabis oil and other byproducts can reduce anxiety ... did you try it yet?
1559 2018-03-26 20:30:50 Very similar, but Mayo is thicker due to greater oil & egg yoke content. Plus, Salad Cream has an ‘acquired’ taste.
1560 2018-03-26 20:30:50 My dad taught me oil changes and tire changes before I grew bored and insisted I didn't need to know these things because I had him in my life. 
1561 2018-03-26 20:30:33 The Push Play Special : Spinach Wrap, Lettuce, A lil mayo, either Provolone or Pepper Jack, A bit of spicy and honey mustard, then a lil salt, pepper, oil and vinegar. Add the Blackberry Lemonade with it as well.
1562 2018-03-26 20:30:20 "Time to saponify some oil to make... something other than soap!" Tom lied.
1563 2018-03-26 20:30:18 Some random man started talking to me while I was getting my oil changed asked me if I was married, then said “Men now a days aren’t no good, even if they do go to church” like thank you for the advice kind stranger 
1564 2018-03-26 20:30:18 love calling out a worker at the IDB about how they allow chinese outbound investment in latin america to be only repayable in crude oil lol

1570 2018-03-26 20:29:46 Not using moisturizer could be why you’re having breakouts. Moisturizers and moisturizing oils are not the cause of acne/clogging pores. You skin produces more of its own oil when your skin is too dry leading to more breakouts. A good moisturizer and exfoliator are a must.
1571 2018-03-26 20:29:43 I keep my beard moisturized. dry shit not the wave plus the oil smell good
1572 2018-03-26 20:29:43 A gun until used is nothing more than a paper weight it cannot make its self point at an individual and oil it’s own trigger
1573 2018-03-26 20:29:41 lol.. Daughter reminiscing give me oil in my lamp.. Not quite sure how to react
1574 2018-03-26 20:29:27 Thanks! I had a healthy spoonful of your MCT oil morning of both :)
1575 2018-03-26 20:29:25 Spot treatment for sure and A face oil for any dry areas, not that my skin is any great but there ya go 
1576 2018-03-26 20:29:20 i dont even know where to start with it mate, why isnt there a 'i want skin like Jamie Genevieve' oil ???
1577 2018-03-26 20:29:16 The question is, do you really expect a stock market propped by nothing-backed fiat to rise indefinitely and carry on as usual even though countries can now trade their oil with a gold-backed alternative?
1578 2018-03-26 20:29:10 Nigerians are confused fellas, they produce oil yet they face a shortage
1579 2018-03-26 20:28:57 But, but,  what about our clean coal and our excess supply of oil? What are we going to do with it all. Your ruining America. Stop it please.

1581 2018-03-26 20:28:41 So as far as balm for my cats, it's looking like rubbing vitamin e oil on their paws is the safest solution. I'm too hesitant to give them a balm that may contain toxic ingredients.

1584 2018-03-26 20:28:18 Rep. Reinbold is now speaking about the oil industry (we'll see if she can do it without impugning the character of the speaker): "People need to understand and appreciate what the oil industry does for this state." #akleg
1585 2018-03-26 20:28:12 I need to get my damn oil changed before my car blows up lmfao
1586 2018-03-26 20:28:12 God bless the U.S.A.

1589 2018-03-26 20:28:03 @OU14Pres A question. As a former lawyer and executive for multi-international oil companies with histories of environmental destruction and exploitation of indigenous peoples and land, how can you assure the indigenous population of OU that you stand for indigenous rights?
1590 2018-03-26 20:27:51 I always have it braided. For convenience honestly but it really helps. Once I unplat, I wash and moisturize with African pride olive miracle moisturizer and I also use Jamaican castor oil  with it. Then back to braids.
1591 2018-03-26 20:27:29 I showed my friend my new little essential oil and they were so excited and it made me feel so validated I cry
1592 2018-03-26 20:27:21 Yeah for sure tea tree oil duuuude. Swear.

1594 2018-03-26 20:27:03 Uum, but one is also an arab muslim. Which one do you think is more likely to get a hot oil shower?
1595 2018-03-26 20:26:47 Ok I beat mirage saloon now but oil ocean is TRUE death
1596 2018-03-26 20:26:30 @DLoesch Flash fry your skinless chicken in coconut oil for less bad fat.  Vegetable oil, except EVOO, is worse than chicken fat, bad for thyroid, liver, immune system. Make America Healthy Again!
1597 2018-03-26 20:26:13 I believe the Father is really behind the situation. The mother is a follower. Does not make it right, I know. Probably beaten into submission. I have no proof...just speculation. Ask her if she ever had hot oil thrown at her!
1598 2018-03-26 20:26:11 It's a sideline to the bigger game of Oil/Iran/Russia...
1599 2018-03-26 20:26:01 Update: Curaçao Blue Bank denies facilitating fraud by oil traders...
1600 2018-03-26 20:25:44 In a perfect world, #CMS would adjust its #HCAP strategy, become expert data provider to and educator of existing consumer-friendly review platforms like Yelp. One shouldn’t try to own both the oil and the pipeline if one isn’t expert at both.
1601 2018-03-26 20:25:42 After going through the hell of addiction/WD from prescribed meds I am SO thankful for CBD oil, Ashwaganda, and Astragalus. I no longer take scripts, I'm totally herbal and feel like my old young self!
1602 2018-03-26 20:25:33 CBD oil is technically legal in Utah, but only for a specific subtype of epilepsy or something like that haha

1606 2018-03-26 20:25:12 Honestly? 1974?, I was still in nappies in NW Scotland. Those days are gone I’m afraid. Maybe 40+ years ago, but we are where we are, and now N sea oil is expensive to extract. Oil price drove huge shale investment in US, so if price climbs they’ll ramp up production again.
1607 2018-03-26 20:25:12 have seen your name a lot with this. good shit!!! always infuriating to turn up with a script for rizatriptan for migraines and have homeopathetic "headache" remedies and lavender oil thrust at me
1608 2018-03-26 20:25:10 As for oil, I could mention that the US oil industry is homegrown and the govt has never used foreign companies but that is irrelevant. It is UG that is our concern. You should address my proposal on its merits not based on other nations that do not matter.
1609 2018-03-26 20:25:04 Obama retains oil sanctions against Iran, dashes Pakistan’s hopes
1610 2018-03-26 20:24:54 Just stop. 
The oil industry is led by a bunch of corrupt narcissists and supported by the greedy National Party & the top 1%.
We've been told there is no planet B - there will only be a tomorrow if we stop now. We will only survive if we make sacrifices.
1611 2018-03-26 20:24:51 We have an Aga as well (inherited with the house) which runs on oil. If we couldn't burn wood we'd have to spend all day every day in winter in the kitchen. These guys don't seem to have any idea of life outside the city/town.

1614 2018-03-26 20:24:40 The oil?? Two people said it's great!! Plus not everything works the same for everyone. A big amount of people loves a serum that did nothing for me, but worst. So maybe this is awesome for me but not for you. I have to try it and i'll see
1615 2018-03-26 20:24:40 Is Saudi Arabi reallly our ally? Their main teaching of Islam is Wahhabism, which is the most violent teaching of Islam. So, with their violent ideology you believe their allies with us? We only cooperate with them due to their mass oil supplies.
1616 2018-03-26 20:24:35 Realistically how much worse would the Oil have been without McDavid? 10-12 standings points? Last instead of 11th or whatever in the west?
1617 2018-03-26 20:24:31 Moloch the burning dollar! Moloch the frightened oil! Moloch the bloody body!
1618 2018-03-26 20:24:23 No one is saying the government should actually force you to stop using oil products before you’re legally allowed to complain. They’re just saying you’re hypocrites. 
1619 2018-03-26 20:24:22 Remember when the jokers on TV are talking about short covering in small cap oil, it's because the big boys like $XOM will have to buy out their assets in order to survive.
1620 2018-03-26 20:24:19 Maybe they need more added liquid/oil to make up for what they lack naturally. I just found it hilarious that they didn't follow the recipe and scored it low when it didn't work 
1621 2018-03-26 20:24:04 cutieee
1622 2018-03-26 20:23:56 . I’ve only been in jail twice dear. Both in Ibiza. One for squeezing baby oil at a man I thought was a stripper I’d seen the night before and the other for throttling a “Lucky lucky man” for trying to sell me a pirate copy of Brokeback mountain.
1623 2018-03-26 20:23:53 I consistently have great pints of Neck Oil at the Wheatsheaf in Borough Market. It’s not a craft beer pub but it sells a lot of it so always fresh. The future of London beer I want.
1624 2018-03-26 20:23:48 @TheJohnSenning maybe lower gas prices with the oil saved from banning straws
1625 2018-03-26 20:23:47 It is about time for the price of crude to go significantly higher, otherwise USA is selling her fast declining precious crude at a huge discount for making shale oil shareholders going poorer.
1626 2018-03-26 20:23:44 After my sensitivity was developed, almost anything can now set it off...energy drinks, cholesterol meds, not enough water, low electrolytes. Potassium helps a lot. So does CBD oil, arnica gel and walking.

Deplorable.
1629 2018-03-26 20:23:04 but it was leaking oil like crazy
1630 2018-03-26 20:22:57 Stick some olbas oil in, then you can focus on how much your eyes are watering. 
1631 2018-03-26 20:22:50 Vegan ricotta made with soya milk, cider vinegar and vegan pesto. Lasts a while in jar of oil. Perfect for baked potatoes and I guess with spinach in pastries..

1633 2018-03-26 20:22:28 Gals, I honestly SWEAR by using coconut oil as makeup remover. It takes about 10 seconds to remove a full face of makeup 
1634 2018-03-26 20:22:17 The Gazprom control over gas has been severely weakened since USA has excess of oil and gas. Gas from America can break Gazprom grip. Russia desperate for hard cash due to sanctions
1635 2018-03-26 20:22:14 Was just thinking, the ability to have minelayers burn ahead of a fleet you're pursuing and mine in front of them could add some tactical advantage to having them. Or laying a minefield behind you while being pursued. (see: Oil slicks). Super excited for if/when this is added!

1638 2018-03-26 20:21:49 Give them crumbs, fishing will still be a major industry, in Scotland if looked after, long after the oil has gone.
1639 2018-03-26 20:21:31 How many mores years before oil runs out ;)
1640 2018-03-26 20:21:21 She definitely was paid by Big Oil.  She admits it.
1641 2018-03-26 20:21:10 The dollar is in a 27-year uptrend against all currencies, metals, oil and other stock markets, and shares with corrective waves, so you can be cautious in making large contracts now and not exceeding 20% of the solvency
1642 2018-03-26 20:21:07 I missed my first boy as he was 5 weeks early & I was on an oil rig!  I delivered the 2nd (came early & born at home) & helped with the 3rd! Have never experienced anything better, why wouldn't you want to be in the delivery room!?
1643 2018-03-26 20:21:05 This gun anti-gunner somehow made a better argument for civilians keeping their guns than most pro-gun ppl. Citizens should have control over government, not the other way around.
1644 2018-03-26 20:21:05 But hey Trump wants oil and coal so screws it for 30 months or so...
1645 2018-03-26 20:20:27 It would be to help remove oil and grease out of concrete etc.

1651 2018-03-26 20:19:36 An extreme example: The slave market a few centuries ago was booming, but was it a net benefit for the slaves?

Or a not so extreme example: Burning coal and oil has measurable effects on worlds climate, but it's still a profitable market, as we are ignoring or externalising cost
1652 2018-03-26 20:19:22 ….Maple Syrups is 13 times more expensive than oil. SO THERE.

1656 2018-03-26 20:18:26 "Can we like oil each other up so we look nice and shiny?"
1657 2018-03-26 20:18:22 The capitalists deceive us into believing that they have rights to land, oil and other concessions.

1662 2018-03-26 20:17:52 The OK legislature is at fault, of course, but lobbying for tax breaks by and for oil companies is alarming (and in my view) makes the oil companies at least equally at fault.
1663 2018-03-26 20:17:34 I have a love-hate relationship with tea tree oil, it is very effective but smell so strong and it burns
1664 2018-03-26 20:17:26 A Doctor about Hempworx:

It’s truly one of the best natural medicine in this world .
1665 2018-03-26 20:17:11 Oh I'd say they are anti freedom of expression. I don't see anti-pipeline voices demanding others stop drinking clean water if they like the oil and gas industry. It's the pipeline proponents who keep wanting terms and conditions before we can object

1667 2018-03-26 20:16:58 There is national oil. Do the other oil companies complain that govt. is competing with them? Does Telkom complain Safaricom is competing with them? Ever heard commercial banks complain about NBK or consolidated bank? What is wrong with ma3 cartel? Can't they compete squarely?
1668 2018-03-26 20:16:56 Coconut oil is the best lube ever sorry, not sorry. You’ll thank me later!
1669 2018-03-26 20:16:55 Ah, so @UofOklahoma named a former oil exec as the new president? I'm so fucking glad I got out of that state that refuses to look past profits and accept that they're helping kill the planet, and I'm so ashamed of my alma mater.

You're not doing fine, Oklahoma.

1684 2018-03-26 20:15:04 The arguments follow the same lines as the House Finance debate in 2016 that ended with the fiscal-plan bill's defeat. Some said no PFD cut without more budget cuts, others said no PFD cut without more income or oil taxes. #akleg
1685 2018-03-26 20:14:59 I also take issue with the clear financial conflict - as it appears that being a donor will buy you the presidency. My biggest problem is the current context though, low state budget allocations to education because of oil tax cuts. It's poor timing.
1686 2018-03-26 20:14:43 Unfortunately the majority of your colleague's are beholden to the fossil fuel industries. So a bill like this, albeit wonderful and idealistic, has no chance in a place where everyone is owned by big oil. Please run for president in 2020, we need you.

1691 2018-03-26 20:13:57 Not sure they're Communists - they're running a lot of ex-CIA agents AND seem almost as owned by the big corporations as the GOP. We're mostly run by the War, Oil, & Drugs Business, w/ private prisons doing well, too. But, you're right - they're not worried about you, Dan.
1692 2018-03-26 20:13:54 Imagine you are an oil sheikh or a government wanting to spread your influence or a fan who has won the lottery...

Do you think any of those would buy half the prize goods?

(apart from maybe the fan still drinking champagne!)
1693 2018-03-26 20:13:33 US oil production highest since 1970's yet cost of gallon of gas up 15% since #Trump inaugurated. Gouging. Profits. #MAGA. 
1694 2018-03-26 20:13:33 crazy aggravating shit, isn't it? mostly when i have learned to LAUGH at it, and just say oh, there is it again, it helps it to stay manageable. cbd oil and alternate nostril breathing are helpful too. 100 little things/no one magic thing help over time. hang in there!!
1695 2018-03-26 20:13:27 "The phoniest and nastiest things in the world cannot be ingested or even fondled - they must be kissed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
1696 2018-03-26 20:13:20 Just got an oil change at valvoline because I had a $15 off coupon and for the first time I didn’t get someone trying to upsell me or convince me I needed something else done to my car 
1697 2018-03-26 20:13:17 The UTL (UP&TC) that couldn't deliver a landline to our home 500 meters away from the Post Office in more than a year? Regarding oil, how come Saudi Arabia and the UAE have managed to use foreign companies to extract it and generate wealth for their countries?
1698 2018-03-26 20:13:16 I'll concede that Boren was intertwined with oil through his political career. My primary issue is that the state of education in Oklahoma has collapsed in the last decade, primarily due to the oil industry that Gallogly was directly involved (and profiting from) at the time.
1699 2018-03-26 20:13:13 how long does an oil change usually take? cause I’m dieing already 
1700 2018-03-26 20:12:59 The writer of the creation story equates the light with day....as though these two are the same thing. Is this an oral story later written down that predates the common use of oil lamps and torches? It is an odd mistake if torches and oil lamps were known.
1701 2018-03-26 20:12:57 #MyDads4WordAdvice checked your water and oil?
1702 2018-03-26 20:12:51 Hmmm. Doesn’t Oslo experience winters just as snowbound & severe as Canada? 
PM Trudeau/Liberals you are out of excuses. If you can’t find (deny it’s existence) expertise simply follow Norway’s science into renewable based future. Cnds impatient with your oil pushing & excuses.
1703 2018-03-26 20:12:42 @jamesmaslow #CBBUS What brand of coconut oil did you guys use that made the popcorn taste soo good?? @ShannonElizab x
1704 2018-03-26 20:12:26 I love spinach, saute with a little olive oil and garlic.
1705 2018-03-26 20:11:56 What your forgetting is all the other special interest money he would have to give up the sheldon Adelson, big Oil company's, his KOCH Addiction !  
Never going to happen 
Keep busting his   I'm sure it's making him crazy  and that's Awesome 
1706 2018-03-26 20:11:33 maybe it's all for show. the bigger news is that price of oil is up, and that makes for a happy Russia.
1707 2018-03-26 20:11:33 Look at California Olive Ranch - avail all over USA, one of few that gives harvest date.  Polyphenol level reduced after 4-6mos to a point where health benefits compromised.  Chile has best olive oil in Southern hemisphere. I've personally tested the Aussie oil polyphenol levels
1708 2018-03-26 20:11:27 Sorry to hear that, not religious or spiritual, but I hope everything goes the best it can! And I hope I'm sending good vibes your way!! Look into cannabis oil, it's amazing!!
1709 2018-03-26 20:11:24 Udah merasa makin tua ketika meja dikamar lo isinya vitamin sama essential oil semua
1710 2018-03-26 20:11:16 For my birthday I got an oil defuser with some oils to make the place smell nice and a yankee candle   fucking love it.  #metalasfuck
#not21anymore
1711 2018-03-26 20:11:06 It’s actually resistance against you clowns Mike.  Like @jjhorgan losing his appeal in court.  The pipeline is getting built.  Move on.  I hear Nigeria is producing oil and shipping it all over the planet.
1712 2018-03-26 20:11:01 The cute guy at the oil place is laughing at me because he told me that I could wait in the waiting room and I tried to take my keys with me 
1713 2018-03-26 20:10:52 federalism is not the sole aim of the EU though, is it? The Islamic invasion and 9th century theology that comes with it is the price being paid for oil. Doesn’t do the Labour vote any harm though. Yet...
1714 2018-03-26 20:10:51 I absolutely hate going to get my oil change by myself. Like no brad I did not ask you to check my air filter??  Wttffff.
1715 2018-03-26 20:10:50 Telecom companies have being here for more than 20 years which is enough to build local capacity as opposed to oil which is relatively a newer sector
1716 2018-03-26 20:10:43 Bought #Nars Allday luminous foundation from Sephora #oilyskin so far I can see some spots of oil seeping through
1717 2018-03-26 20:10:31 that was a hard decision to make but ya gotta do what ya gotta do
1718 2018-03-26 20:10:25 Desperately rubbing coconut oil over my body in case I can fix myself because I’m a fuckin mess x x

1720 2018-03-26 20:10:21 Stocks up, USD down, Treasuries down, Oil down. We have not seen panic in 2018 and this is no euphoria yet.
1721 2018-03-26 20:10:17 Only missing Oil of Ulay.
1722 2018-03-26 20:10:15 i saw tanning oil in my room & put it on just for fun bc the smell reminds me of good times
1723 2018-03-26 20:10:07 泣いてなんかいないよ、これは心の油だ。
1724 2018-03-26 20:10:03 What’s in for him? He billing you buy the hour? Or siphoning oil out of your cars? Maybe he wants your job, or simply to fight you, but for that he’ll send someone else to get hurt or killed in his stead. #utterscum #blair
1725 2018-03-26 20:10:02 Mukwano the magic is eating it while still hot.. I to was worried about the oil but my cousin told me somethings we have to let God take control.
1726 2018-03-26 20:09:56 Problem isn't just adulteration but age of olive oil. Most don't give harvest date - that's all you care about, not some arbitrary expiration date.  Oil will taste ok but polyphenols are compromised/levels reduced
1727 2018-03-26 20:09:50 We should only move forward when we have Ugandans to lead. In '98, UDB should have broken UTL into seperate companies to sell to employees who then compete. As for oil, leave it under until we have skills. Only Ugandans will grow UG. Since 1894, foreigners have only kept us poor.
1728 2018-03-26 20:09:34 Frequently sold together with castor oil and 'Toxin binding gel for cleansing the gut' because, of course it is.
1729 2018-03-26 20:09:32 Our local tv stations can break in to alert people of emergencies like tornadoes, oil refinery explosions, incoming nukes... Each local station tests their system randomly once a month. The alarm is loud & unexpected. And with DT in charge... I'm extra edgy these days.
1730 2018-03-26 20:09:30 Any of my friends looking for a medium/light oil show halter with lead, also a purple sleazy with matching tail bag like new? Both horse sized. 
Show halter with lead $40
Sleazy and tail bag $25
1731 2018-03-26 20:09:15 Just love seeing protestors who all walked to the protest site from all over bc What's that you drove with gasoline then stood in warm clothing made from Oil that flows through that line . Walk there or horseback in your buckskins and MAYBE I'll believe that horse shit #cdnpoli
1732 2018-03-26 20:09:15 Tomorrow i'm taking the car to the Spa for intensive treatment. Cam belt,water pump, oil leak and service.Goodbye £700 i will miss you
1733 2018-03-26 20:09:07 Such a fantastic convo tonight on @EthicalHour all about plastic. A final thought - imagine what will happen to the oil industry when the world collectively rejects plastic... the answer may offer a reason for the great resistance thus far. #EthicalHour
1734 2018-03-26 20:09:07 Connecting the dots: remember- using & burning used oil products affects both air & water when no environmental controls used. And no oversight frm state DEQ. U are needed on the Columbia River in PDX. Foreign money?
1735 2018-03-26 20:09:02 Stone, gravel and cement at least you can find here. I agree. so the only way this makes sense is the bitumen. It's the only bit that i think we still import and oil is not cheap.

1737 2018-03-26 20:08:53 My goal is to buy a share of a REIT every week and a share in the tech or oil sectors each week. Any excess will be sprinkled around financials, consumer staples, defense, and retail.

1752 2018-03-26 20:07:08 SAT Question:

Oil is to Vinegar as America is to ______? 

Answer: Black
1753 2018-03-26 20:06:52 Arghhh! My whole point is that stopping the expansion of the oil sands WILL NOT reduce emissions one iota. The increased demand will be satisfied by Russia, middle East or US. Why would you want to make Russia richer and Canada poorer unless you're a Russian?
1754 2018-03-26 20:06:42 I got oil and a filter for my car and since the weather is getting warmer, it's time to work on RAVEN.
1755 2018-03-26 20:06:22 Burns my ass when I see this stuff, same with all other "miracle" cure crap and anti-chemo fake news. Chemo put me into remission, not a tablespoon of kale-infused weed oil. Although I did smoke weed and used oil during treatment for side effects.

1762 2018-03-26 20:04:35 Weird! Maybe a head fake from the CNY oil contract launching on the same day?
1763 2018-03-26 20:04:30 Yes it is. I won't be doing that fish though, don't trust their oil. That's why I buy and boil it from home.
1764 2018-03-26 20:04:27 Over the weekend I changed the oil in the wife’s Odyssey for the umpteenth time as well as changed the roller assembly on the passenger sliding door. I’m a big fan of @NAPAKnowHow @DuluthTradingCo
1765 2018-03-26 20:04:14 I cannot believe anyone says that. Show no understanding of cost of opportunity, what drives investment and the positive impact of FDI in oil for R&D, innovation and technology.

One word: Canada
More words: Norway, Singapore, UK North Sea, North Dakota, Texas, etc

1772 2018-03-26 20:03:18 Some people are incapable of seeing the larger picture. Focusing on individuals and particular incidents reduces complex issues to one-on-one scenarios where any number of "perfectly reasonable" points can be made to buttress a position (see NRA, Big Oil, Pharma, and Tobacco).
1773 2018-03-26 20:03:17  haba dai use shea butter and coconut oil instead

1776 2018-03-26 20:02:44 They all died when the owners ruined the electrics by adding neon lights, blew the transmissions by money shifting and blew the engines when they didn't change the oil xD
1777 2018-03-26 20:02:41 As it should be.  I was just pointing out this is not for legal "weed", but hemp to make rope, clothing, etc.  The hemp oil can be made into plastics without using petroleum.  One reason we are so beholden to petroleum is that so much is made from it other than just fuel.
1778 2018-03-26 20:02:24 Coconut oil clogs pores, creating breakouts. We have high moisture products with no oil residue available to assist with that.

1782 2018-03-26 20:01:43 In 1998, how many Ugandan companies applied for telecom licenses? Or - let's look at more contemporary times - of all the companies prospecting for oil and bidding to drill and refine it, is any 100% Ugandan? Why?
1783 2018-03-26 20:01:41 Hahah it’s not a very pleasant experience but it’s necessary every now and then to remove excess oil in their fur and freshen them up. I can’t take pictures during cause it’s very much a struggle and a two handed job hahha
1784 2018-03-26 20:01:37 Stop selling Nigeria’s oil immediately and force Nigeria to survive on agriculture and other resources, other countries are doing it and they’re surviving, what if Biafra succeeded, Nigeria wouldn’t have any oil, so we need to be able to partition our resources,1week? Impossible
1785 2018-03-26 20:01:36 Calm down mechanic guy. Just here for an oil change. If I wanted to know about all the other shit wrong with my car I'd turn the radio down.

1850 2018-03-26 19:53:52 *My* right to make money on oil is more important than everyone’s right to clean air and water.  It’s basically all “me me me” at the expense of the rest of society.

1854 2018-03-26 19:53:26 I get about 80% of my detangling done in the shower that way. (Add a little more soap if you need to.) Then twist out with equal parts shea butter, jojoba oil, and aloe vera.
1855 2018-03-26 19:52:41 I just put salt, brown sugar and olive oil with the potato. I didn't tried to stuff it. It looked way more like fries but since it was made in the oven I thought 'baked' was a better way to describe it.
1856 2018-03-26 19:52:38 Still thinking about Chris Rock's show Tamborine. Even the way he dressed said "I'm worthless". Always a snappy dresser in the past, he looked like he was about to change the oil in his car. So much guilt and resentment. I felt so bad for him. #Peace&Healing
1857 2018-03-26 19:52:34 RVP easy to deal with no? A oil stabilizer is essentially a plug and play to most oil batteries.

1863 2018-03-26 19:51:33 the argument that england  subsidizes scotland  has long been disproved .even without oil scotland is an economically viable country .many more natural resources than comparable small countries -eg ireland norway  ,slovakia  and a host  of  others which survive very well .

1878 2018-03-26 19:50:10 Nordstream 2 is trade, not for UK, it uses LNG from, Russia too.

Europe, climate, could use gas instead of coal, oil, less CO2, pollution.

UK uses coal, gas itself too.

Let us not build bridges or walls, let us build pipelines to use gas.

Germany has positive trade balance.
1879 2018-03-26 19:50:08 I usually just mix maybe a half tbsp of soap (I use Dr. Bronners liquid, but a bar would work too.) And mix a half tbsp of coconut oil in my palm and put it into my hair before any can fall into the floor.

1925 2018-03-26 19:43:57 IMO, OK policy is influenced by George Kaiser.  Kaiser is not a shale driller, his company has no part in increasing our oil production from 150,000 bpd to 500,000.  Kaiser is old conventional oil and if up to him, gasoline would be $8 per gallon, just this little guy's opinion.

1935 2018-03-26 19:42:27 “Spraying with olive oil” 

I see the problem. 

Get yourself some rapeseed oil. You need a high heat for an omelette (which olive oil can not tolerate as it burns) and more than a spray of oil.

1938 2018-03-26 19:41:49 And BTW, why should we pay for protecting, sheltering and feeding Arab refugees when we transfer billions upon billions to get oil and gas from other Arabs? The Saudis, Kuwaitis and the others should cover the tab. They certainly have enough money.

1947 2018-03-26 19:41:18 Spatula. Main issue is the omelette slightly sticks to the pan (despite spraying with olive oil first), so I have to go all round with the spatula to unstick it. which breaks it a bit.

1964 2018-03-26 19:39:06 My nieces are miracle cure suckers. They post ads on Facebook. They believe marijuana oil cures EVERYTHING. Asthma. Diabetes. Gout. They also thought bullet coffee,or w/e it was, was a miracle. 
1965 2018-03-26 19:38:57 De que sirve llevar a la quiebra a Oil Combustible? de nada!!! la situación del cobro de la AFIP será igual o peor, crecerá el desempleo, lo que hay que preguntarse quien de los CEOS gubernamentales quiere quedarse con la petrolera, sin hacerse cargo de la deuda con la AFIP.
1966 2018-03-26 19:38:46 I wanna drown in coconut oil
1967 2018-03-26 19:38:40 Do you shop around for oil? Ive been using the petrol station which probably isn't the cheapest or safest method
1968 2018-03-26 19:38:39 Three main ingredients in coffee mate coffee creamer “water, sugar, vegetable oil” In the sugar free “water, corn syrup, vegetable oil” im fucking done, like wtf? #readyourlabels
1969 2018-03-26 19:38:38 But I see just as many eSports problems as I do FGC. And these two coming together feels like oil and water with it's own demons and angels sometimes. And frankly when I see big business involved in anything? I'm going to be apprehensive regardless.
1970 2018-03-26 19:38:37 So coconut oil ain’t that good for your face after all
1971 2018-03-26 19:38:37 I’m going to get my baby Christian right this week. He has an oil change and wash calling his name!
1972 2018-03-26 19:38:36 Salmon oil on their good for about a year fixed my dogs skin probs and they both have very soft fur now. This was like 4 years ago and theyre still good
1973 2018-03-26 19:38:36 BL...are you a twatter or twatettes?
1974 2018-03-26 19:38:08 el iluminador unicorn oil trucho en once está $50 y acá las revendedoras te lo quieren cobrar $250 AMIGAA
1975 2018-03-26 19:38:01 I also do baked salmon at least once a month. Get a huge half a fish, bake with parsnips, carrots, baby potatoes, drizzle in oil & spices, super easy, lovely; Another one I do a lot is baked fish wraps, Pita bread, pickles, tomatoes, spinach, garlic sauce, and fried fish.
1976 2018-03-26 19:37:57 About who
1977 2018-03-26 19:37:54 Good news is I was able to tell the car place to only change my oil this time bad news is they’ve found a $450 problem 
1978 2018-03-26 19:37:43 Funny, I thought Olicity is slick (as in oil slick)
1979 2018-03-26 19:37:27 nooow were cooking with peanut oil
1980 2018-03-26 19:37:23 Nationalizing oil revenues?
1981 2018-03-26 19:37:14 I gotta ask y u have virgin olive oil next to chocolate milk ..
1982 2018-03-26 19:37:13 Oil leaks
1983 2018-03-26 19:36:59 Maar Minnie and this show  oil and water.
1984 2018-03-26 19:36:46 All that shit trump was talking about china and he still managed to let them be the new number 1 crude oil exporter
1985 2018-03-26 19:36:45 #Tulsa #SocialSecurity office:  First they reported suspicious "white powder" on an envelope.  Determined to be "crude oil" smudge instead.
Some people cried on scene.
The plan to create a hysterical herd of compliant wimps is working.
Jesus come soon.

Stay here with us Twat-ters and Twat-ettes
1989 2018-03-26 19:36:23 "Oil from only the finest dew-washed, tender baby snakes!"
1990 2018-03-26 19:36:10 Get a grip, Joshua. These people are standing up for the health of our planet. If anyone's being "extraordinarily arrogant and disrespectful", it's the oil industry who are wreaking so much damage to our climate. #EndOil
1991 2018-03-26 19:36:06 BREAKING: A woman is suspected of bursting through the roof of her house earlier today. One woman held in custody. More details: apparently the oil was very, very slippery. Says: girlfriend simply held her too tightly during lovemaking. Helicopter still there. Awaiting further d—
1992 2018-03-26 19:36:02 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!
1993 2018-03-26 19:36:00 Oil tank means no go on tooling but probably great for belt pouches, messenger bags, etc. You can always stitch or rivet a piece of veg tan onto it if you want something tooled on part of whatever you are making! Thanks for the heads up @CullensWorkshop !
1994 2018-03-26 19:35:57 Eventually we’re all gonna die and the earth is just going to be a barren mass grave and we’re all gonna get turned into crude oil. But it’s chill bc it doesn’t matter if your an idiot sometimes
1995 2018-03-26 19:35:52 Hope everything is alright at home???
1996 2018-03-26 19:35:44 solo carga Tinelli en OIL
1997 2018-03-26 19:35:36 I'm tighter than a uniform, I call it olive oil. Cash Money.
1998 2018-03-26 19:35:33 Definitely. Just fresh tomatoes, olive oil, a little water, sea salt, garlic, basil, flat parsley.
1999 2018-03-26 19:35:32 I’m the same - I used to use the body oil from loccitane but it got too expensive 
2000 2018-03-26 19:35:31 In 2003, petroleum experts predicted $300/bbl oil by now. Global population has increased over one billion since 2003. Yet, extreme poverty has decreased by one billion due largely to Chinese export growth. 

Shale oil didn't exist until 2012. 

Energy was red alert in 2003.
2001 2018-03-26 19:35:26 The guns are sexy and all but I am all about the black and white llama photo on the wall. That cinched it for me.
2002 2018-03-26 19:35:21 my brother just threw 100$ on my lap and told me it’s my tattoo money, shiiiit IM thinking about going to work at the oil rigs 
2003 2018-03-26 19:35:21 maybe I should end my LSE days and just be a twittette.
2004 2018-03-26 19:35:04 Wow, that's alarming. Will the USA aid Saudi Arbia especially after we all know that the majority of 9/11 highjackers came from Saudi Arabia? As long as OPEC keeps messing with oil production, we shouldn't help. We may experience an energy crisis as a result.
2005 2018-03-26 19:34:58 the global rout is over . OIL is the only catch now
2006 2018-03-26 19:34:47 Use boiled water and sea salt and then put some tea tree oil on it for 5 minutes and wash it off with more salt water, it works the best !!
2007 2018-03-26 19:34:37 Oil refinery in Mozambique totally unfeasible, experts warn
2008 2018-03-26 19:34:37 Get the Body Oil plz 
2009 2018-03-26 19:34:36 Putin wants to build a road from Russia to N. Korea.He may want a road there so he can transport oil from Siberia to a port so it can b shipped to refineries.If that’s his intent I hate to break it to him that oil as a fuel will soon lose its value as world converts to renewable
2010 2018-03-26 19:34:24 Actually.... we think they are amusing. They accomplish nothing but make them look like Idiots. So, keep marching and wasting time and money. The airlines and oil co. Love it. At least it was kinda peaceful this time.
2011 2018-03-26 19:34:13 I have tons of work to catch up on.  Time to burn the nine-thirty-five to quarter-past-ten oil..

2012 2018-03-26 19:34:06 I‘m conservative but, we need medicinal marijuana

My husband & mother are helped far more than with RXs. They use CBD oil. Husband has neuropathy & mom has familia tremor. What they have experienced is nothing short of a miracle. No high, numbness & shaking gone.
2013 2018-03-26 19:33:42 Oil... Heated at high temperature... Bursting open...
2014 2018-03-26 19:33:21 Apparently I should spritz my hair with argan oil every day. Clearly thinks I care more than I do... 
2015 2018-03-26 19:33:15 Four Loko is named after its four primary ingredients: Malt liquor, motor oil, snow cone syrup, and the stuff that strips away the strength of the Black Panther
2016 2018-03-26 19:33:04 The mod cabin got some dope shit. I use the soap and beard palm and oil keep its super shiny and soft after a brush session. @TheModCabin
2017 2018-03-26 19:32:53 2/ @RusEmbUSA @GK_Seattle @Russia
As anyone who has traveled around Russia knows, it's a corrupt kleptocracy, basically a Third World country only kept afloat by its oil and natural gas resources. What manufactured/service sector goods does Russia produce that the world wants?
2018 2018-03-26 19:32:42 Bought these 4 today at the tip for £12!  #upcycle, #revive, #salvage not sure whether to sand (glue!) and wax/ oil or paint ... any thoughts ... ? @AnnieSloanHome @countrylivinguk @simplethingsmag
2019 2018-03-26 19:32:39 I had my uni grad photos today and I put oil in my beard and slapped it down to avoid having to trim it perfectly.

It was mango scented.

I smell way too fresh for my own good now fuck.
2020 2018-03-26 19:32:37 I dont want any Culture or Religion that advocates pouring hot oil on people who refuse to participate in depravity anywhere NEAR America..
2021 2018-03-26 19:32:35 Try using castor oil.
2022 2018-03-26 19:32:34 It's a tough day on the course at the Sunoco Campbell Oil Classic as @LMU_Golf is in sixth place following a 33-over par 321 in round one. The Lady Railsplitters trail the leaders by just eight strokes with the day's second round underway.
2023 2018-03-26 19:32:33 It is always easy to point to everyday visible items ie oil industry as the source of BC declining wildlife. Maybe you should be concerned about what you can not see as the source of what is actually effecting the wildlife.
2024 2018-03-26 19:32:27 i drew the sexiest oil pastel apple today and it was the peak of 2018 so far for me
2025 2018-03-26 19:32:15 Nope heid lots is shit been spoken on Lse  bb regards James 
2026 2018-03-26 19:32:03 Hahaa cheap olive oil shampoo with lavender 
2027 2018-03-26 19:31:51 Lol why!? It’s not even cooked in any oil or butter
2028 2018-03-26 19:31:49 Atramp tells the gambler that he is talking about the existence of Churchill's law, which told the royal family in Saudi Arabia that it is for ballot boxes and oil for sleep and so how in a world became the fifth wave of the McLaughian thinking about this law
2029 2018-03-26 19:31:39 What to be expected? Baghdad oil $$ pays for every military on planet + private contractors "training" 'Kurdish' military.
2030 2018-03-26 19:31:36 So the dirtiest oil in North America is from California. Sigh....,
2031 2018-03-26 19:31:27 yeah eggs and fish oil make dog fur softer. If you do it long enough, they can be 10 years old and still feel like puppy fur in some cases
2032 2018-03-26 19:31:14 Cause city would be a nothing club without oil money
2033 2018-03-26 19:31:12 Learned some good Irish in Nashville. Say “Whale Oil Beef Hooked” fast. You now know Irish #LearnSomethingNew
2034 2018-03-26 19:30:59 Hi Sammy`s Mom That was smart of you to find out if the olive oil could be harmful for Sammy. Sammy must be pouting now since you took pan away from him but it`s best for Sammy and we all want Sammy healthy , Love Hugs to you & Pats and Meows for Sammy xxx 
2035 2018-03-26 19:30:58 Cos curly fries tend to have a golden brown coating on them,as well as a seasoning blend of onion and garlic powders as opposed to French fries which  are just sliced potatoes fried in oil.
2036 2018-03-26 19:30:47 Didn’t Frontier just report that there’s some oil companies who won’t be paying corporate income tax for YEARS due to being able to claim the losses they experienced during the recent downturn?
2037 2018-03-26 19:30:37 whats the effect of fish oil in dogs? nicer fur?
2038 2018-03-26 19:30:28 So do most farmers in our country. Hemp is a great resource for many products, CBD Oil being just one.
2039 2018-03-26 19:30:25 Russians. Nobody like them. Nobody wants to be like them. Other than oil (which just happened to be there) there's not a single thing that Russia produces that other nations want to import. Change your diapers, Andrew. Another huge mess.
2040 2018-03-26 19:30:24 Yeah she probably just sold you some fancy oil
2041 2018-03-26 19:30:02 I wonder how goofy it looks when I have to climb on the tire of my truck in order to reach the oil dipstick to check it...
2042 2018-03-26 19:29:58 I’m actually down to deport ALL criminals. Look how perfect Australia turned out, right?
2043 2018-03-26 19:29:49 Kia is rated one of the most reliable brands and for a reason: They are simple. No turbo to fuck with, no tune to worry about. The oil and transmission fluid is easy to change. And even on the Sorento, which boasts a V6, you get nothing. It's quiet,
2044 2018-03-26 19:29:30 ran outta heating oil so my house is now <60F HURRY UP SUN JFC
2045 2018-03-26 19:29:24 Good point.  The NYMEX contracts of course are rarely physically settled, and the 1.2 Billion barrels a DAY of trading represents 20% of ANNUAL U.S. crude oil demand. LOL.
2046 2018-03-26 19:29:23 There will be NO positive  environmental effect, expect people to be more broke, so there more likely to be NEGATIVE environmental effects, people will do oil changes themselves and dump oil down the sewer, among other corners broke people cut...
2047 2018-03-26 19:29:22 You just licked a rock covered in plaster and rock dust and oil pastel and my hand sweat
2048 2018-03-26 19:28:38 True that. Probs erdogan got pissed somebody destroyed his truckline of stolen oil so now he's out for vendetta
2049 2018-03-26 19:28:21 From what I recall, Irving oil may have the capacity to process some Bitumen but not the coker upgrade that they need to do it. They previously stated that Bitumen would not replace any imports.
2050 2018-03-26 19:28:20 I am taking stuff right now for my ulcer and it has already made me gag and wanna puke and it’s only the first day I’m trying it. 1/4 of a cup of straight aloe vera juice 3 times a day, 4 huge capsules of slippery elm 3 times a day, and a capsule of fish oil which smells v bad(:
2051 2018-03-26 19:28:12 they condemn opioid crisis and sell commercial time to pharma.
they proclaim danger of global warming and sell to oil.
they r shocked and afraid of Trump but give him wall to wall coverage.
If it pays it plays.
"Fake news" has legs because of this. 
As much truth as the tabloids
2052 2018-03-26 19:28:05 That must be a FN ad
2053 2018-03-26 19:27:50 I shaved w coconut oil yesterday annnnnd I cannot stop rubbing my legs lol
2054 2018-03-26 19:27:37 They deserve no less than what she got. Slow boil in oil sounds good to me.
2055 2018-03-26 19:27:33 Can you confirm this, as my wife used to work for the company who made Carex and it comes as a surprise to her that they aren't still using sustainable palm oil plantations?
2056 2018-03-26 19:27:25 Do we know if this oil company is on the list of favorite money laundering firms in vodkaland? 
2057 2018-03-26 19:27:24 Given the situation in both Trinidad & Venezuela today, one must temper the exuberance about this possible oil find. Bauxite was the oil of the 70’s & 80’s and look how we managed those resources. When you are bad with money, no matter how much you get, you will always be broke!
2058 2018-03-26 19:27:15 *nods* I'm currently using a shampoo bar that comes just wrapped in paper which I find okay. How do you mix reg. bar soap with coconut oil? Do you melt them in together? Do you use any particular kind of bar soap? lmao, tell me everything!
2059 2018-03-26 19:27:15 in more lighter news I am giving my dogs 1000mg of fish oil daily in an attempt to make them even comfier boys
2060 2018-03-26 19:27:08 when you forget to clean your car before taking it to get an oil change. Whoops. Well this is awkward.
2061 2018-03-26 19:27:00 True or False: All cars, regardless newer or older models must change engine oil every 3000 miles
2062 2018-03-26 19:26:57 But he blocked them from shipping oil off the West Coast, denying them  jobs and revenue 

Thick as a post.

2071 2018-03-26 19:25:39 Norfolk folk

If you fancy some lovely (very reasonable) extra virgin olive oil, do get in touch with @Mothers_Garden

2072 2018-03-26 19:25:38 entire fib patterns reached in a days time. Gold ripping, yields rising, dollar sinking, oil neutral, DC chaos as always and this equity ramp since 11:30am today w/o interruption. Will the 3:30+ selling come in and if it does, oh damn once again. If not today, this week?

2079 2018-03-26 19:24:51 @nickofnz I as a human am happy about ending oil. But I am also worried about the thousands of workers and their lives. Has anyone gave a thought about how to keep them in jobs? I have and it's a great one and it will work. It's also great for.the economy there. Get in touch.
2080 2018-03-26 19:24:51 @business must be getting their facts from the most reliable greenpiss green weenie scientists that are never wrong - strange how they don't mention California heavy oil dirtier, has higher carbon footprint than oilsands derived oil but yeah spin away
2081 2018-03-26 19:24:49 I am glad you like it. 
That's the original artwork. Oil on Canvas and I just received from the artist last week.
2082 2018-03-26 19:24:48 Babs can point you In the right direction to manufacture as many as you want.
2083 2018-03-26 19:24:43 Nooo!  Silly analogy - plastic waste is terrible, but it's puffy clouds compared to coastal oil spills!  Let's be real.
2084 2018-03-26 19:24:19 Apparently it’s herb fries in olive oil!
2085 2018-03-26 19:24:17 THAT was his real sin, along with nationalizing oil revenues. He had to be demonized before any of our client states got ideas.
2086 2018-03-26 19:24:15 Interesting. However, I believe the increase in oil prices was primarily caused by the comments of the Saudis and oil inventories in the U.S. rather than being a safe haven for investors...
2087 2018-03-26 19:24:08 note to self: don’t ever decide to put pure coconut oil all over yourself as moisturizer. you will strongly resemble the BP oil spill.
2088 2018-03-26 19:24:01 I was scared to get my oil changed so I called my mom and now she’s gonna meet me there ADULTHOOD IS QUAKING
2089 2018-03-26 19:23:41 A thousand Thank Yous to KimmyAnna, who came and helped us give all the Rattie Girls olive oil baths while Bill cleaned the cage! I love you, KimmyAnna! <3
2090 2018-03-26 19:23:41 america loves boiling stuff since the word oil is in it.

2095 2018-03-26 19:22:45 Taking the Argan oil off my hair with a strawberry shampoo. Add to that my cherry bakewell bubble bath and blackberry soap and I smell like a fucking Kopparberg.

2097 2018-03-26 19:22:38 Was it Total Engine oil you made this sauce with? Looks really appetizing.

2130 2018-03-26 19:19:19 As opposed to Justin finding another made-up feminist cause in a Muslim country for "women's rights"...$650 to 800 million pledged?  Anywhere but Canada's interests are Liberal priorities.  How about stop importing Arab oil and developing our own?  @MichelleRempel

2134 2018-03-26 19:18:53 @BPCLimited Where and how do file an offical complaint against a pump that has been providing third-class oil which I feel is adulterated?
2135 2018-03-26 19:18:53 Besides, for may Canadians (east) believe it is better to get oil from foreign countries. But, does that really help our global environment, and the Canada’s economy by sending our currency offshore, instead of circulating within Canada, and helping our economy. Just asking?
2136 2018-03-26 19:18:49 Steve, I respect honestly held opinions. Too many foreign funded eco-advisors spread falsehoods and exaggerate real risks to water, land and air with a single singular goal of land locking Canadian oil for the benefit of international competitors while being silent on real issues
2137 2018-03-26 19:18:42 or chuck as much oil! but I know what you mean

2145 2018-03-26 19:17:43 With the two stroke oil, for the first couple of weeks it may run a little noisier and smokier, but once it has done its thing it will run smooth, quieter and the emissions will go down. Do this every time you fill up with fuel to keep the engine in good condition.
2146 2018-03-26 19:17:26 (1/3) The oil executives who became the dean and board of OU Earth and Energy paid for my and my peers tuition and have worked to maintain a healthy low-income student program. In my department in particular, they’ve tried to balance the gender gap.

2152 2018-03-26 19:16:16 Rather than cleaning as such you are looking for any leaks from the seals. With regard to keeping them clean one of the best things on the Freelander 1 TD4 is to add some standard two stroke oil in the ratio of 200:1, so that is approximately 0.25 litre to a full tank.
2153 2018-03-26 19:16:14 A crazy day running kids to psychiatric appointments now this extremely long pick up line! Thank goodness for stressaway oil!
2154 2018-03-26 19:16:08 And now, finally, we will turn the tables, however don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
2155 2018-03-26 19:15:41 They wouldn't be there without the agreement of the Greens. @AJWVictoriaBC is so drunk on Power that he's guaranteed the BC NDP can sell BC to Big Oil and Big Unions until the fall. No need to wonder what will happen if we elect a BC Green government. They can rationalize it all
2156 2018-03-26 19:15:40 Sorry mate, I'll be more aware of my sunflower oil privilege.
2157 2018-03-26 19:15:35 Excellent article. A lot to consider. Regarding D3, can I take cod liver oil without vitamin D going into D 1,25?
2158 2018-03-26 19:15:30 Don't blame others for KRG corruption!
Baghdad gave the salaries to KRG but KDP/PUK mafia didn't pay the employees!
What do you want Baghdad's government to do?
BTW, KRG continue to sell oil illegally!
Election coming soon, don't reelect the same corrupted politicians!

2176 2018-03-26 19:13:02 Always wear gloves when handling any chemicals as cleaners are designed to remove oil and grease as well as the natural oils in your skin.

2185 2018-03-26 19:12:15 There's no legal precedent for deporting a citizen, is there? A permanent resident with a green card should understand the consequences of committing a felony. Even a Dreamer would have been deported for what this gentleman did.

2218 2018-03-26 19:09:26 I hope this 'oil industry' isn't planning on breathing fresh air in Wellington. Guess it will be the usual group relying on a stable climate, clean water, fertile soils and the like.

Aloe Vera plant to moisturize after?

2248 2018-03-26 19:06:38 True. The new oil contract will make some news for about the next day or so then sink into insignificance until the Chinese government attempts to manipulate it.
2249 2018-03-26 19:06:38 Oil & gas companies are my candidates for falling from grace
2250 2018-03-26 19:06:37 I feel like I get an oil change like every other week 
2251 2018-03-26 19:06:29 If we're being completely honest then Russia didn't exactly support Syria in regard to Afrin and instead allowed Turkey to steal Afrin from Syria. In exchange Turkey is to do more oil deals with Russia and buy thier S400 system. Syria gains nothing from the deal.
2252 2018-03-26 19:06:26 Ohhh I love Kiehls! Just bought their recovery oil as a pressie & it was a struggle to hand it over. We'll plan an catch-up evening in Ms McBride & arm ourselves with recovery goodies
2253 2018-03-26 19:06:22 Biff is only speculating, but yep, MANY oil rigs in the area.  Plenty of them mothballed.

2255 2018-03-26 19:05:58 For those who asking why they are in Middle East the only reason is Oil nothing else. And they want to be there in the name of terrorism. Which does not exist actually.

2257 2018-03-26 19:05:40 How boiling the sob in oil!
2258 2018-03-26 19:05:36 Uhh, most likely shuttling workers to and from the oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico.

2273 2018-03-26 19:04:00 What’s so great about hummus?
It’s just bean dip with seasoning.

Mmm, garlic.
Pass the hummus please.

Hey, rube, I'm thinking of a quote, it's "Hell hath no fury like a... like a..."

Like a what, though, Ann? Was it "Like a pundit who bought a whole lot of snake oil because it sounded as hollow and hateful as she was?"

The research needed to determine the correct dosage for CBD oil in dogs simply hasn’t been done yet, Coates says. And, to make matters worse, FDA testing has shown that many CBD products contain little if any CBD, she adds.

2286 2018-03-26 19:02:03 I may not be able to get to this today, but I haven't forgotten about you. For what it's worth, I did an oil/SPX correlation study a few years back and while there are pockets of s/t positive correlation, overall, the l/t correlation was near .100 if I remember right.

2289 2018-03-26 19:01:36 Compared to $ billions spent on increased oil and gas every year... After 50 years of knowing about climate change, that doesn't make Shell part of the solution in my view
2290 2018-03-26 19:01:29 You can save some money by buying the oil and oil filters yourself in the future. I live in Seattle and it's usually $30 for the oil change by itself.

2319 2018-03-26 18:58:08 My concern is about the usefulness of BE as a metric given its static nature. Costs, even efficiencies, are influenced by oil price. Using a BE of X as the decision metric isn't necessarily as relevant if price changes throughout and so will X - looks like a  reference
2320 2018-03-26 18:58:01 Fried rice! Make one more serving of rice than people you plan to feed, put it in the fridge, the next day chop up some brisket and some green onions and fry them just long enough to be warm, then add the rice and some oil and fry until hot.
2321 2018-03-26 18:57:51 For the US Embassy, watching over the transportation of oil. And if im not mistaking, the largest military base happens to be in Kuwait.
2322 2018-03-26 18:57:50 Pipelines definitely are less of an issue than shipping oil and worse yet raw bitumen in tankers.
2323 2018-03-26 18:57:41 Absolutely correct. Coal and oil won’t run out, they’ll simply become uneconomical
2324 2018-03-26 18:57:41 Millions will now stop using Spanish produce, no rice, no wine, no olives, no olive oil, we WILL make a difference.

2354 2018-03-26 18:55:16 I thought I would only be spending like $70 on an oil change. Next thing I know I now have $309 less in my bank account. 
2355 2018-03-26 18:55:15 The new great game of USA can be damaged by China's Yuan based future oil pricing mechanism. If oil and gas priced in Yuan instead of dollar then the collapse will begin for USA as Rome.
2356 2018-03-26 18:55:15 CapEx spending is very important in O&G, they have CapEx budgets 2 + 3 times higher than any other industry.  Less CapEx spending means they drill fewer new wells, employ less people, and produce less oil + nat gas and IMO, Oklahoma becomes poorer for it.

2366 2018-03-26 18:53:24 Honestly a lawn mower is like a textbook case of where electric power is superior. Lots of torque, light weight, less maintenance, and easier to stow away without worrying about oil and gas leaking from it.

2372 2018-03-26 18:53:13 Trump is shrewd watch how he starts to sell oil to Europe under priced an bring Russia to its knees. Here in the U S gas will be $1.85 an the economy will surge. All the nay sayers will cease and  fast food jobs stop being career jobs.

2381 2018-03-26 18:51:47 Forcing social engineering politically creates resentment. 
Organic social evolution occurring slowly over time promotes wider acceptance.
2382 2018-03-26 18:51:44 I love oils and I want to know how to better use them so I can make better paintings. I'm so mad that I took these courses and never learned the basics. I even had one professional oil painter rudely say "read a book" when I asked her for tips (I have books on oils).
2383 2018-03-26 18:51:41 Sisterhood is sharing your tanning oil
2384 2018-03-26 18:51:35 This is decent volume considering how small the float is. Like I said, I think some smart people are grabbing shares down here while they can. This walked up to .90’s on air a few months back. With oil on fire, and news flow hopefully soon @StamperOilGas is a good gamble imo.
2385 2018-03-26 18:51:24 funny how you're a dickless coward who loves his country so much he's willing to deport the veterans who served it, rather than admit he was too much of a pussy to serve your country yourself

2389 2018-03-26 18:51:04 A head wrap and essential oil does not an expert make.
2390 2018-03-26 18:50:58 Yeah, but I'd hit that
2391 2018-03-26 18:50:35 for 10K so can you.
2392 2018-03-26 18:50:19 Putting castor oil on my eyelashes and pep talking myself infront of the mirror is so therapeutic
2393 2018-03-26 18:50:11 Trying MCT oil at too high of a dose is indeed an unpleasant experience!!  N1.

2395 2018-03-26 18:49:53 try coconut oil that might help the process and it's good for your skin
2396 2018-03-26 18:49:45 Thought of the morning: 

Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)...can you really be an extra virgin?
2397 2018-03-26 18:49:33 i'm not saying it's not illegal i'm saying he had PTSD and we're going to throw him out of the country when if you did the same, being the cowardly non-veteran you are, you'd get to stay?
2398 2018-03-26 18:49:32 heavily invested because I know all about the roller coaster of oil and gas. Simple to buy low and sell high but waiting sucks

2401 2018-03-26 18:49:11 Maaaannn if I would’ve know that they were gonna detail my car when I went to get my oil change then I wouldn’t have washed it and vacuumed it before
2402 2018-03-26 18:48:56 True. Isr. views entire region as threate. but look at European-american history in the region you'll know that America took over British and French oil interests after the sites crisis and we we're warring over our interests. 1/2
2403 2018-03-26 18:48:54 Have you considered what your life would be like without oil? You wouldn't even have a device to tweet.
We are far from the point where we can reject oil. The point is to continue to improve environmental aspects.
2404 2018-03-26 18:48:53 Micah 6 I brought you up from the land of Egypt...With what shall I come before the Lord?...Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of Rams? Ten thousand rivers of oil? What does the Lord require of me? To do Justly, to love mercy, to walk humbly with my God. #obedience

News today was About *2)
More news coming I hear
2406 2018-03-26 18:48:32 And during that high employment due to oil/gas, did we follow good financial principles & put $ into savings? NO. We gave it away to Gov/Congressional campaign donors thru tax cuts. And cut school funding. And delayed road repair.  Idiotic.
2407 2018-03-26 18:48:18 Heard from my Doula Trainer today ... excited!! You can follow Apostles Oil and Bread Pregnancy @OrganicallyHis #livesinMastershandsJesus
2408 2018-03-26 18:48:11 Coal is obsolete we really can eliminate it. Oil is obsolete for light duty vehicles  (try an EV, you'll love it!). 

But we are still reliant on oil for aviation.  But we're working on gixing that. (Hyperloop, electric planes, hydrogen, synthetic fuels, etc)

2411 2018-03-26 18:47:49 This winter everyone's car has been stuck, revving back and forth, idling forever, cold starts, wet, frozen in, drifted in, short trips . . . .then they tell me they don't need an oil change or service.  So you are saving $150 on your $10K engine every year.  Right.  Got it.
2412 2018-03-26 18:47:45 @DianeBlackTN how much blood money do u receive from the NRA? Oil corporations? Anti workers rights organizations? How much do pay for healthcare, the best the USA OFFERS?
2413 2018-03-26 18:47:41 @SadiqKhan Her name is Maarib Al Hishmawi-beaten , burned by hot oil..by her parents. Speak to her about the offenses she endured in Texas, America. If only this were about offensive Muslim speech.
2414 2018-03-26 18:47:39 I could smell the tea tree oil from that tweet 
2415 2018-03-26 18:47:08 Also, does McL EVER use his timeout to try to calm the fragile fellows? If you have the lead it’s not wasting it.
Then in OT everyone but Oil coaches saw what the Mighty Phucks were doing...no fresh legs??? Nurse played it weakly but shouldn’t have been out there.

2420 2018-03-26 18:46:22 even a synthetic oil change, as some are suggesting you may have gotten, shouldn’t run you more than $65
2421 2018-03-26 18:46:15 SHUT OFF THE OIL TO BC!
2422 2018-03-26 18:46:02 Do what Mathew said plus add some ice to the cold water and put some olive oil at the junctions for lubrication.

2424 2018-03-26 18:45:46 $90 for an oil change.... She done lost her damn mind
2425 2018-03-26 18:45:42 I thought since it’s Monday no one will come and get their oil change
2426 2018-03-26 18:45:41 Can anyone tell me why I'm taking fish oil? Like I've been taking it but I just don't even know why or if it's doing anything

2428 2018-03-26 18:45:26 I have never been in a drive thru oil change this is legit
2429 2018-03-26 18:45:25 hello, you were grossly overcharged for a simple oil change, overcharged even if they replaced the oil filter and the oil. $50 regular is even a little high.

#Modi at #Davos (Jan 2018) : Data is real wealth

At least now after all the news about data harvest in #Facebook; hope those blind faithful followers realise what those 2 statements mean for India.
2434 2018-03-26 18:44:50 You don't often find Americans pouring hot oil on the children for not wanting to marry into an arranged marraige.

2437 2018-03-26 18:44:34 I’m about to ask my pain clinic about CBD oil. It’s finally “legal” here in Indiana. If it gets me off other meds, even better.
2438 2018-03-26 18:44:29 Shorty make my heart tingle like when I put tea tree oil in my hair
2439 2018-03-26 18:44:18 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
2440 2018-03-26 18:44:18 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

2442 2018-03-26 18:43:59 But all this respond to one single issue, Syria was rescued from their destruction as state by Russia, so now there is no chaos like in Libia to still the oil, and some one has to pay for it
2443 2018-03-26 18:43:57 Mr President endorse Biafra Independence today and let Biafra regain the control of its oil Boko Haram terrorists and Mohammad Buhari will be defeated. Nothing else in world today will defeat the Boko Haram except Biafra Independence. Mr President this is answer to Boko Haram
2444 2018-03-26 18:43:49 now cannabis oil is legally available, objective, cut down the prescribing of Opioids to sick people, Good News. NO, it’s not subsided and at $660 to $1000 a month the sick can’t afford it, Why is price 5x+ USA Retail, who’s making bucks out of the Sick.
2445 2018-03-26 18:43:35 British politics is great at the minute. You're either a politically correct snowflake or a money grabbing racist. That's it. Next election I'm voting for whoever promises I can rub baby oil on their boobies.

2447 2018-03-26 18:43:20 That's a €100 per thousand litres price difference. 
And if this anti Russian thing will escalate,  who knows where the price of oil will go
2448 2018-03-26 18:43:15 This is a fun game: I believe in people ambulating at a mild pace on two legs, but I do not endorse walking. 

I believe in smashing peanuts with oil into a creamy paste, but I do not endorse peanut butter. 

I believe in eating only plants, but I do not endorse veganism.
2449 2018-03-26 18:43:09 I'm not a bot, and I'll  tell you the same thing. Obama did every thing he could to destroy this country. Took big bucks from oil guys to approve fracking in the Dakota's, destroying the ground water in most of the U.S. Out sourced our jobs to China and Mexico.
2450 2018-03-26 18:43:09 Stormy uses oil of bukake! I didn't did I!
2451 2018-03-26 18:43:06 My tailbone has been killing me for day. I asked my pastor if he’d lay hands on my coxis. He’d said he’d get the oil. Sunday school has never been more fun! #SundayFunday
2452 2018-03-26 18:43:06 It's not just the fact that China is now the world's largest oil importer, it's that they are also the number one manufacturer of goods in the world. It is difficult to find items not made in China in full or part by China. This used to be the USA's position for the past century.
2453 2018-03-26 18:42:55 ON NOW: RNZ reporter Katie Scotcher is outside TSB Arena in Wellington where an oil & gas conference is happening. Protesters have blocked entrances.

2455 2018-03-26 18:42:47 Feeling very meh about OUr new president, who lacks experience in higher education but has plenty of experience working in the oil & gas industry. 
2456 2018-03-26 18:42:47 For full synthetic that’s about the going rate but most cars don’t really need oil that expensive. Your engine will thank you at least.

2463 2018-03-26 18:42:23 #StuffPDPShouldApologiseFor
We were earning lots of money from oil, why didn't the @OfficialPDPNig implement social welfare programs like the school feeding program? Why didn't they build metro rail lines? For 16 years, why didn't they reduce poverty, malnutrition?
2464 2018-03-26 18:42:05 He would prefer to be afraid of The Big Bad State than see you have a .22, thankyouverymuch.
2465 2018-03-26 18:41:45 Yep. I trust my dad w/ my car more than I do those people. I’ll let him check it out before I let some mechanic try to rip me off for no reason. They better just change my oil and let me go home.
2466 2018-03-26 18:41:40 covered frying pan low heat with a little olive oil sometimes better than eating it at the restaurant.

whew.

2468 2018-03-26 18:41:22 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
2469 2018-03-26 18:41:09 They can't do like SA o, we still depend on oil largely for our earnings. You want ND Avengers to continue blowing up the pipelines?     
2470 2018-03-26 18:41:06 What kind of reaction? Coconut oil can cause breakouts.
2471 2018-03-26 18:40:43 Repaired a few small cracks w wood glue. Have it in the bag with holes in it like you said. Keep applying oil. Anything else I should do??
2472 2018-03-26 18:40:37 Not Russia, but Syria. Russia supports Syria, NATO wants to put oil pipeline through it. To do so NATO needs to put Assad down, but Russia fight terrorists there and backs Assad, what to do? Claim that Russia is a threat to West and bomb Damascus.

2480 2018-03-26 18:39:50 Have you thought about trotting out any qualified candidates for this poll? Your choices are akin to asking “which of the four would you most like to put in a sandwich?”

1. Potting soil
2. A Bible
3. Oil filter
4. Used hockey glove
2481 2018-03-26 18:39:35 The anger of these ppl should be noted. Get their way, what will anger them next? Ppl like this ALWAYS searching for the next cause.
2482 2018-03-26 18:39:34 Yup, but I think you need to get the oil in a cartridge form to be able to? I'm not a frequent user of CBD so I'm not really sure how it works but I bet other people can weigh in with more info
2483 2018-03-26 18:39:28 I got a oil change last week n my engine light on I'm hot
2484 2018-03-26 18:39:18 They are certainly prettier than oil wells and coal pits.
2485 2018-03-26 18:39:10 Yes it’s awful going back tomorrow with a bin bag see what we can collect what a mess it is spotted some oil coming up in the sand also 
2486 2018-03-26 18:39:10 EPIC grape juice olive oil victorias secret perfume i love herny i want henry to watch ur moth.
2487 2018-03-26 18:38:54 Correct. By building a pipeline and capturing market share WE can control environmental and human rights issues. Without that market share (pipeline) our environment is at the mercy of oil producing nations with less commitment to those issues. This seems to be lost on people.
2488 2018-03-26 18:38:45 Idk what kind of car you have but i would not pay $90 for an oil change. Did she upsell you on some “Super premium oil” or some shit?
2489 2018-03-26 18:38:27 If you got synthetic oil that’s not a crazy charge
2490 2018-03-26 18:38:25 Face oil convert! Use it over my night cream (which I use over serum) before bed and it's really making my skin glow!
2491 2018-03-26 18:38:23 Boko Haram terrorists hates America. Mr. President the only way to defeat the terrorists now is to cut off their funding Biafra oil money Mohammed Buhari is controlling. The oil belongs to the Biafran people. Let Biafra take back it's oil Boko Haram terrorists will be defeated
2492 2018-03-26 18:38:06 Two bananas, a single-serving yogurt, a raw egg, and 1c of your favorite fruit juice in a blender. A scoop of protein powder, splash of oil, or even half an avocado can tailor it to your dietary needs.
2493 2018-03-26 18:37:42 AWWW yes make sure you lapped up all the oil Sammy . Now that your Mommy knows you like the oil maybe she will treat you some every day You too & your Dear Mommy have a very nice Day ,Love Hugs Meows Purrs xxx 
2494 2018-03-26 18:37:37 Unbeleivable savings due to fuel economy drive. This will balance the rise in consumption expected due to rising demand of oil from China & India
2495 2018-03-26 18:37:35 Yeah he has. An awesome moment for him. And even Connor made him feel special on the ice ! I hope Besr stays with the oil for time to come
2496 2018-03-26 18:37:35 And yes, under Obama, we did become a TOP exporter of oil. We could keep those levels (no need to increase them) as solar, wind and even geothermal grow. Then, over time, fossil fuel extraction and processing could be sensibly downsized.
2497 2018-03-26 18:37:28 Pastor Jeffress is not a Christian. He is an heretical make-believe fake Christian who perverts the Teachings of Jesus and profits off the anguish of ignorant people by selling them snake oil.

2515 2018-03-26 18:34:44 The dentist asked if I still work at olive oil
2516 2018-03-26 18:34:30 They are building 100 s of hydrogen refuel station for zero emission cars, that’s better than any other big oil company.
2517 2018-03-26 18:34:27 The first time you use it it's awful but the flavor goes away when you get used to it (it's still oil in your mouth though, ick)
2518 2018-03-26 18:34:23 You stand in an office, which is nearly empty but for an oil lamp sitting on a chest of drawers.
2519 2018-03-26 18:34:12 Oh, skin transitions SUCK. I got adult acne when I moved from Colorado to Los Angeles in my 20s. Right before I moved here, I had a esthetician tell me in more humid climates, we need more oil on our faces and she suggested I do a facial oil, which was interesting. I’m gonna try
2520 2018-03-26 18:34:10 I do not enjoy putting oil in my car
2521 2018-03-26 18:34:09 so i’m like 99% sure i was overcharged for an oil change bc the lady (she was white) knew i didn’t know what the hell she was talking about
2522 2018-03-26 18:34:09 US Crude Oil Futures Settle At $65.55/Bbl, Down 33 Cents, 0.50 Pct #OOTT, CL_F
2523 2018-03-26 18:34:04 Absolutely correct. PDP only want to comeback to loot and stay put even if they lose election again, we cannot afford to give PDP another chance after 16 straight year of failure, nothing concrete was left, roads, power, hospitals, schools, water, nothing despite Oil boom.
2524 2018-03-26 18:34:02 I’ve heard cloves numb the area and clove oil
2525 2018-03-26 18:33:59 Here's an idea for your next project! Oil pastels + canyons + rhythms + tarot! Go!
2526 2018-03-26 18:33:57 Combined can be aforce. Balance, considering 60 vote rule, procedures of Congress make control very tenuous. Especially Senate 1 can  eff it

2533 2018-03-26 18:32:59 #MyDads4WordAdvice Remember, change your oil!
2534 2018-03-26 18:32:58 Holland and Barret do CBD oil it's low dosage, but it will work for you bud.... I aherm know about this type of medication and it's derivatives 
2535 2018-03-26 18:32:45 Yes that too. Wouldn't you if you were worlds biggest importer? Does it make sense for the Chinese users of crude had to hedge their crude oil needs in North Atlantic or in Continental US? 45 or 60 days away while there is no good way to hedge the shipping costs.
2536 2018-03-26 18:32:36 I am sick of buying more expensive oil from the U.S. I would like to support AB/Canada with also getting cheaper fuel at the pumps, BC is already too expensive due to the BC Liberals selling us out to untaxed offshore $ from China. #VanRE #bcpoli #pipeline
2537 2018-03-26 18:32:34 Been waiting to get an oil change for over a hour now tf !!!
2538 2018-03-26 18:32:31 And proper fish & chips, cooked in dripping. None of that palm oil mind.
2539 2018-03-26 18:32:30 Don’t care if I found stupid, but Where did you get the phrase “woke”... what is it?
2540 2018-03-26 18:32:28 MY COWORKER GAVE ME AN ESSENTIAL OIL TO RUB UNDER MY NOSE TO GET THE SMELL OUT AND NOW ALL I SMELL IS SPEARMINT AND MY NOSTRILS FEEL COLD 
2541 2018-03-26 18:32:11 When Kikuyu MP admits about mid-night oil  by Mt Kenya Mafia cartels it speaks volumes of @UKenyatta ignorance that shows #GovSonkoIsWorking
2542 2018-03-26 18:32:08 Not really, the argument is always that this is to protect wildlife. Instead of waiting for an oil spill to happen which it maybe never will, why are people not hot mad about the destruction of wildlife that is currently happening? Over time there may be 0 left to argue about.
2543 2018-03-26 18:32:07 That cars leaked oil on the drive again.
2544 2018-03-26 18:31:52 If anyone is wondering what is in my hair, it's vaseline oil that I have to have
2545 2018-03-26 18:31:49 Chain migration?  Hope they brought good olive oil too.

2553 2018-03-26 18:30:37 I've had cbd gummies before, but haven't tried the oil. The gummies did more to help me sleep well than settle my stomach.
2554 2018-03-26 18:30:29 Ajaokuta is capable to help Nigeria govt diversify from oil based economy.
2555 2018-03-26 18:30:27 It’s literally the only show we watch as a family these days. I swear, I could talk my kids into changing the oil on my car if it meant we could watch an episode after.
2556 2018-03-26 18:30:22 What year does it peg peak oil at?
2557 2018-03-26 18:30:21 Even if you're blind you're not deaf. If you're not seeing it, you're hearing it. Is it an economy that inflation has gone down 4 13 consecutive mnths or the 1 been boosted by agric & non oil sector diversificatn.
2558 2018-03-26 18:30:15 Forget Jeff Koons - Cubism is nothing without crude oil
2559 2018-03-26 18:30:15 I think overall thse things are individually overblown. Cumulative efforts though cannot be dismissed easily. Single issue  ignorant voters

2563 2018-03-26 18:29:42 @korbiante The one on 38th is called Magnificence, it’s on 38th & Emerson. But there are two great places called Oil Palace in castleton square mall and there’s one by the Walmart on Lafayette road. Now, there are some guys that walk up and down 38th by the fairgrounds with oils
2564 2018-03-26 18:29:30 Have you tried high CBD hemp oil?
2565 2018-03-26 18:29:17 @AMike4761 #BecauseMuslimsAreOffended They get to pour hot oil on their female child in America when she rejects an arranged marriage at 16 years old.
2566 2018-03-26 18:29:14 Hmmm I’m happy with that...... nothing quite like some warm freshly baked homemade spelt bread and butter (well olive oil spread for me) as a nutritious snack before heading out #followyourbliss #dowhatmakesyouhappy #raiseyourvibration #juliettebinoche #appointment  @ Gidea Park
2567 2018-03-26 18:29:02 Goodnight to everyone who lives in a household ine that cup mu fridge with used oil stored away for a rainy day 
2568 2018-03-26 18:28:59 CBD Oil is a natural remedy and has anti-inflammatory properties. You'd be surprised at what it can do for you. Be sure to check us out if you're interested.

2582 2018-03-26 18:27:55 I hope it highlights uniformed ignorance, unrestrained hatred and vitriolic attitudes of thse ppl towards Constitution/gun owners generally.
2583 2018-03-26 18:27:43 STOP!!! You are all “racist”!!! This is just a Moslem marriage preparation to get her ready for her unknown invader!  Shame on all of you!!! Everyone has a right to know what married life will be. “ A little choking “ “ a little hot oil “ mind your own business 
2584 2018-03-26 18:27:40 come to get an oil change and these boys are trying to basically have me buy new everything. if i wanted all that i’d just go buy a new car. carry on with just the oil change i came in here for.
2585 2018-03-26 18:27:35 Alright I’m sorry, but it doesn’t take over 2 hours to do an oil change. I would get it if it were busy here, but it’s not. At all.
2586 2018-03-26 18:27:33 The US holding onto oil reserves in the east might be the only tool to remove Assad. Without his removal there will never be a free Syria in his lifetime
2587 2018-03-26 18:27:33 Some oil splattered and it caused my house to be super cloudy!
2588 2018-03-26 18:27:28 *brings my car in for an oil change*
mechanic casually: “you’re due for new tires is it okay if I do that today too?”
yeah sure go ahead let me just pull 2K out of my ass today 
2589 2018-03-26 18:27:22 I could never take people in the military who consider themselves heros seriously. You're just another tool of the government so they can start wars over oil and power and dismantle other countries by dozens..

2593 2018-03-26 18:27:07 Thinking he be liking the higher oil for now - maybe the odd diplomat retaliation comment might help or leave that up to the Tsar
2594 2018-03-26 18:27:01 Like over easy?  Just use lots of oil and not have the heat too high once the egg is in the pan. Sometimes I'll tilt my pan so oil will go over the top of the egg and cook it a bit before flipping it. 
2595 2018-03-26 18:26:21 Printed photos of the kids, oil pastel all over the back of the photo, then just place the photo on top of their sketchbook/cartridge paper, masking tape in place and use a sharp pencil to draw over/add tone!

2597 2018-03-26 18:26:17 Lel. Install a puppet in Iran. Fuck off. We know what you did to Mosadegh. Oil interests matter, nationalization down down.
2598 2018-03-26 18:26:15 We willingly creating a contract with armed police/military for security is okay. But if we create a constitution that limits the power of military and protects the right for the people to be armed, OMG SLAVERY11!!!11111!!11

2601 2018-03-26 18:26:08 Mustafa, nonsense.  Want cheap oil?  Go dig for it.  Want someone else to deliver it to you?  Pay for it.  Do you work for free, as a means of refusing to "blackmail" your employer?
2602 2018-03-26 18:26:07 Brussells are great with a little oil, salt, pepper, and minced garlic, but bacon fat and a balsamic glaze will set it off
2603 2018-03-26 18:26:06 So sorry! Does the tiger balm/hp help? I use castor oil compress for cramps and aches, but I also have different conditions.

2656 2018-03-26 18:19:03 The trnsmtn pipeline has operated since 1953 without catastrophe. Recent studies show that bitumen floats on sea water and is easier to clean up than other types of oil spills. You already have tanker traffic in your harbours, because you consume oil. No one protesting that hmm?

2660 2018-03-26 18:18:31 I was working backwards from the article you cited, those countries were not listed. Expelling diplomats not a huge deal. When/if the West puts an embargo on all Russian gas/oil, then we’ll know this is serious. #SkinInTheGame
2661 2018-03-26 18:18:30 If it can save just 1 life? At a certain point legislating what people ingest, moral values and so on is pointless windmill tilting. Stop it
2662 2018-03-26 18:18:28 I am trying castor oil at the roots of my hair before washing. Just started, but it looks promising. I am also a fan of wigs, so am trying to figure out how to use them

2664 2018-03-26 18:18:22 These people crazy as fuck lmao they tried to charge me $102 for an oil change

2668 2018-03-26 18:18:05 Market share. Capture market with ethical Canadian oil where we control  environmental and human rights issues.
2669 2018-03-26 18:18:03 This article pissed me off. The author has oily skin because she isn’t moisturizing after washing with just soap. If you went to a dermatologist, they’d tell you the same thing. Soap dries the skin further and then you produce more oil. This is science. Not makeup quackery.
2670 2018-03-26 18:18:01 Wonder if Snake Oil is a non-ironic product you can get for snake care? Poor guy selling it having his reputation tarnished by the common conception it's useless when in fact it's specially formulated to have many health benefits for your lovely reptile
2671 2018-03-26 18:17:53 I wonder if CBD oil will help on my ankle? Ive never tried it before...

2688 2018-03-26 18:16:11 That is exactly how my oil painting class went as well.  I never picked them up since, it felt like such a clumsy medium to me. I've looked up tutorials online and I might try it again one day.

2690 2018-03-26 18:16:07 The early success of the CNY oil contract means that anyone bearish on CNY based on IMF FX Reserve Adequacy math may need to revisit their assumptions - if the contract is successful, China will gain a 2nd lever with which to manage their Current Account.
2691 2018-03-26 18:16:04 Hemp is not cannabis.  The cotton and petroleum industries don’t want the competition.  You can make all kinds of things with hemp,  it’s the male plant that contains little to no THC.  Hemp fabric is more durable than cotton and the oil can make plastics.

2693 2018-03-26 18:16:01 I think it was pretty well ignored as not being worth the paper it was written on. Except the optimistic oil projections, of course. They were pounced on.

2698 2018-03-26 18:15:32 That's a great question, but I don't think so in the case of soy vs. coco.  Coconut oil has high % of medium-chain fatty acids (C12) vs. soy (C18).  That's one-third shorter....

2715 2018-03-26 18:13:20 Again you miss the point and are misinformed. This is a multi-use pipeline. It will transport various products. Some to be consumed in BC. Bitumen is not the 'dirtiest' oil on the planet. You don't even know what 'dirty' means. No oil is 'clean'. Get the facts. Care about Canada.

2731 2018-03-26 18:11:40 The significant volume seen in just two trading sessions, coupled with the movement we've seen already in the USD/CNH may very well be suggesting that the impact of this new oil contract is going to be more immediate and more far reaching than even we were inclined to believe.

2738 2018-03-26 18:10:44 This exchange allows them price suppression control on oil, their largest import. I don't see how gold can diverge much with oil price suppression enforcement. Unless correlations breakdown?
2739 2018-03-26 18:10:33 You could have a dry skin type which produces excess oil and you're mistaking that for having an oily skin type. This might sound counterproductive but try moisturizing with non greasy oils like coconut oil, if it works it means you've been misinterpreting your skin type.
2740 2018-03-26 18:10:31 Love and solidarity to our comrades blockading the Oil Summit in Pōneke today!

2741 2018-03-26 18:10:29 This is beyond frustrating. These price bumps come with no rationale. Can someone explain why the price of gas is so high here? Do we need some regulation? Who is benefitting? Government tax coffers? Gas stations? Oil companies? And what can we, as consumers, do?

As for May, she knows we don't have rail capacity. She's using this as "support for oilsands" while she's fighting against it.

2779 2018-03-26 18:06:06 This Oped isn’t convincing. It only gives sound-bite rhetoric that is short on reason. ACES was a much fairer plan (for the state and citizens) that needed to be tweaked to our advantage for low and mid-range oil prices.

2782 2018-03-26 18:05:30 Mash a piece with coconut/ vegetable oil. If the red color is natural it will fade away in 30 min. (Lycopene, responsible for the color, dissolves in oil.)

2796 2018-03-26 18:03:54 Nope! Having a BLT now. A dash of oil, salt, pepper, and great tomatoes are all you need.
2797 2018-03-26 18:03:52 Low IQ listen and believe the snake oil seller who peddles that the world is a simple place full of goodies and baddies. It's also easier to believe you're a victim of a conspiracy than admit you're workshy.
2798 2018-03-26 18:03:47 Chinese steel. Widely rejected in the oil industry due to not meeting the spec that it’s sold under, used for a massive piece of infrastructure in Scotland. Mark my words there will be problems with that bridge in no time.

2801 2018-03-26 18:03:31 I’ll be there. Don’t know much about Cincy’s support but Indy has a passionate (if kind of new) supporters contingent. Dunno how it’ll all feel and sound in Lucas Oil though. I doubt there will be more than 15-20k, we’ll see.
2802 2018-03-26 18:03:30 The cost per watt of solar has gone from $78 in 1978 to $.50 today and is projected to cost $0.35 in 18 months. The future doesn't look good for oil.

2816 2018-03-26 18:01:58 By that logic, nobody should ever spread the peace message in America. We are in 7 wars, 3 of which are over oil, and all of which murder innocent people and continue imperialism.

Spreading the message of peace is MORE effective in hostile territory. Not the other way around.

2930 2018-03-26 17:52:35 really? i dated a Virgo and we felt like water and oil
2931 2018-03-26 17:52:32 I still think #GoldmanSachs might be close w/ their bet, though I agree w/ you otherwise;  the fact that Iranian sanctions will likely be announced in May, coupled with rapidly declining inventories and other risk factors, leaves possibility of #oil hitting $70-80 by June.
2932 2018-03-26 17:52:29 Where are you follow me let’s chat DM aim here
2933 2018-03-26 17:52:25 Just make sure you season the bottle before drizzling oil

2942 2018-03-26 17:51:33 Waiting for oil change, tire rotation at dealer. Been here 3 1/2 hours now. Seems on the long side.
2943 2018-03-26 17:51:32 In business blackmailing & cartelism is not allowed. Why world scumbs to OPEC blackmailing. Unnecessary rise in oil prices brings problems for middle & working class all over the world. Couple of million bbls of oil production rise & fall cannot account for doubling of oil prices
2944 2018-03-26 17:51:23 Homily Summary: The aroma of the perfumed oil used to anoint the feet of Jesus fills the house (John 12:1-11). Could it also have filled the empty tomb? We are anointed at baptism & confirmation to fill our homes & the world with the aroma of Christ. #HomilyTweet
2945 2018-03-26 17:51:22 Imagine spending so much just to see a prophet who will tell you to buy oil and his other things.
2946 2018-03-26 17:51:17 Fun Fact: The number one killer of Orangutans is palm oil. Forests are getting destroyed and replaced with palm trees. Over 100,000 Orangutans have been killed in the last two decades.

2955 2018-03-26 17:50:00 By that logic, I can "save" money on my car by never putting oil in it or not replacing the brakes and tires. Do that long enough, and you find yourself in need of a new car.
2956 2018-03-26 17:49:52 My view is China intends to switch their bid from the ICE Brent/WTI financialised oil complex to a cleared/guaranteed LME-style Shanghai forward market. I think this is a response to US #EnergyDominance oil strategy
2957 2018-03-26 17:49:47 After years of subsidising them with handouts, just what does England see in the beautiful, oil rich country of Scotland?

2968 2018-03-26 17:48:36 You're deflecting this to be about something other than oil tankers and oil spills. You can't compare the minimal amount of tankers sailing out of Westridge since 1953 to the huge increases proposed and call this equal, just to sell us on more. #bcpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM

2992 2018-03-26 17:45:45 You're right that cottonseed was a "waste" product, they first wanted the cotton fiber, but when they go to the seeds, the oil was paramount.  This effort was ramped up during war times, with oil being the main product.  Later, processing the meal (without oil) became important
2993 2018-03-26 17:45:43 @kashrutcom could you please clarify about Kirkland Organic virgin coconut oil- cold pressed, if it Kosher for  Pesach ( as it stay in your website) and source for this information .Thank You .

2997 2018-03-26 17:44:58 Don't forget the whole NSA PRISM Program, BP oil spill, persecution of more whistleblowers using the Espionage Act than all previous presidents combined, 90% of drone targets being innocent, and pushing for a $1 TRILLION nuclear upgrade
2998 2018-03-26 17:44:42 Doing a job without the necessary tools to complete it is not only super frustrating and annoying but it makes the job that much more dangerous for me when working around hot oil, love it
2999 2018-03-26 17:44:40 So is the PPT :-) Oh, and welcome back. Yuan oil contracts actually opened and did around 40,000 contracts. Better than i thought. Another notch taken out of the dollar. Along with South Korea and China skipping the dollar.

3006 2018-03-26 17:43:54 banned or sold off rights so we can pay treble for our own gas/oil when Putin kicks back.  Genuine question cos I am never sure what we still own as a country
3007 2018-03-26 17:43:51 there could still be oil and other stuff on her face im? i dont even use face masks really but that would make me frustrated too

3010 2018-03-26 17:43:37 Someone else sent it to me as proof that alternatives to oil exist. Waste of time. Btw, shipping by rail is an idiocy compared to pipelines.

3014 2018-03-26 17:43:05 Why do millions of barrels of imported oil not get evaluated for emissions and human rights records when our Canadian/Albertan oil lives up to the worlds highest environmental standards and Canadian human rights? #ableg
3015 2018-03-26 17:42:34 OK, I've never heard of anyone in Scotland cooking a turkey by deep frying it whole in an oil drum.
3016 2018-03-26 17:42:19 Yes you were a very bad influence.  As it happens an acquaintance is in great pain and finds she has to take far fewer painkillers when she uses the oil.

3020 2018-03-26 17:41:43 I was pretty surprised the Oil gave up a 3rd for him, first time I e really watched was this weekend and I was impressed. Good to hear he’s been doing good things all year
3021 2018-03-26 17:41:43 til that coconut oil may be a great natural conditioning treatment but it is very difficult to wash out of your hair
3022 2018-03-26 17:41:43 Start your own business. Thirst based oil chances and built these companies. What makes you think they shouldn’t get more. You have s job by someone who started s business.
3023 2018-03-26 17:41:39 Yay! Congrats girl!! Send me some coupons for my oil change on my Honda! 
3024 2018-03-26 17:41:33 Ah, I remember that one a few years ago.  It's interesting.  The main issue here is that the chow diet is less refined than the others with corn starch and dextrins.  In addition, the soy oil diet actually provided more metabolizable energy (useful for growth, etc.) than coco oil

3031 2018-03-26 17:40:58 Can never forget the time some people were going to host something in my sec school titled 'oil on canvas'. Our fine art teacher prepared us bustaid.. we practiced every form of art/painting in prep for the day.

Only for it to turn out to be a gospel themed talk 
3032 2018-03-26 17:40:50 oh yeah thats right... i beleive the news talked about it being for the protection of the people because there was a lot of violence (it could very much so be for the oil)

3049 2018-03-26 17:38:28 I'd say #Santorum's "Learn CRP" statement was like "Instead of putting new brakes on your car, you should learn how to fix collision damage", but it's dumber than that. It's more "Instead of putting new brakes on your car, you should learn to change your oil." It's a #nonsequitur

3052 2018-03-26 17:38:07 My hairs semi permanent purple, then semi black over the top, then permanent black, but the blacks have started fading for some reason? It's going to be sooo much hard work,  but I might try a colour remover but I'll soak my hair in coconut oil the night before or something
3053 2018-03-26 17:38:06 I believe Markham covered that in his article. Kenney obfuscates, misrepresents, and often lies about stuff. Both of them were wrong in how they approached what was happening in BC. The wine ban was silly posturing. Threatening to cut off oil or gas like Kenney did, dumber.
3054 2018-03-26 17:38:06 Why Thomas? Why ignore that the oil companies now agree with AGW?  Why ignore the projections for sea level rise that will put places like Miami/New Orleans etc under water by end of century, if not sooner.  Why? Is it because you and I will be long gone when it hits the fan?
3055 2018-03-26 17:38:00 Oil changes take forever.. they just be looking for stuff to find.

3070 2018-03-26 17:36:14 Act. there is a recipe in my GSD: "put the iron spoon or pie iron onto coals to get hot. Immediately add a little olive oil and a sprinkle of herbs ...then an egg, previously cracked into a bowl...Then salt and place on the coals until done."
3071 2018-03-26 17:36:08 Alaskans own 1,353,241 shares of RELIANCE INDUSTRIES LTD, worth $36,520,402. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in INDIA.
3072 2018-03-26 17:36:05 Hey girl! I wonder if putting a teaspoon of cod liver oil in my morning tea with a lemon or orange wedge will be good for me? @sexxielexxie
3073 2018-03-26 17:36:04 Didn't Trump appoint an oil exec to the State Department.  He knows how to navigate international waters we were told.  Not so much.  President of a University should have some academic experience I'd say.
3074 2018-03-26 17:36:03 My car just had a major oil leak and I’m still getting my nails and feet done 
3075 2018-03-26 17:35:44 Other CDN provinces don't want oil from AB. But they also don't want to take a long hard look at where the oil they consume comes from. Guaranteed it's imported from countries with terrible environmental practices. Do you know where the energy products you consume come from?
3076 2018-03-26 17:35:41 Does eggs, honey and olive oil really work for your hair 
3077 2018-03-26 17:35:41 @OutnumberedFNC nobody cares about consensual Affairs that happened 12 or 13 years ago but we do all care about a mother and father that are Muslim sold their daughter for $20,000 to be married to someone she didn't want to marry they beat her and they poured hot oil on her
3078 2018-03-26 17:35:36 Not sure any amount of TLC can sooth this Fucker Geege, besides I am 68% Clove Oil presently
3079 2018-03-26 17:35:26 No, the oil was always the main product with veg oils.  That's why solvents (hexane) are used, to extract as much as possible.  The meal, with the protein, was not.  Also, why is rice bran oil unsuitable to be fed to pigs?
3080 2018-03-26 17:35:26 Oil change today, car wash Wednesday, hair Thursday.

3084 2018-03-26 17:35:03 Useful for their oil, some drawbacks.
3085 2018-03-26 17:34:59 They would have never even started digging for oil if it weren’t for American ingenuity. We showed them how.
3086 2018-03-26 17:34:57 But Siph, Russia also profits through war & instability... Just look at Syria et al. They’re a massive exporter of arms & arguably benefit the most from higher oil prices. Perhaps they false flagged the false flag eh?

3092 2018-03-26 17:34:18 Blanched or ground almonds whizzed up with salt, lemon juice, oil (eg olive) and garlic can make a fairly good feta replacement. It can be shaped and baked or i use it in vegan spanakopita

3097 2018-03-26 17:33:46 Two words: OIL & GAS!
3098 2018-03-26 17:33:40 I use it for oil machines since once you get a ton of pigs making truffles the oil adds a couple hundred g to the sale price. Not that much once you get iridium foraging. Slime isn't really all that worth it considering the chore and space it takes up on your farm.

3101 2018-03-26 17:33:20 I find the best way to eat avocado planely, as in not in guac or part of a larger dish, is to cut it in half, canola oil each exposed side and add salt+pepper, then grill for about 5-10ish minutes. Fill the center with salsa, chopped tomatoes etc.
3102 2018-03-26 17:33:19 I started shaving with coconut oil yalllllll it’s the best thing since fried rice .
3103 2018-03-26 17:33:11 It's been tested and proven. The only product my hair likes is castor oil and anything with castor oil in it. Everything else is a no.
3104 2018-03-26 17:33:07 they want oil money and could careless about kurds they used my people
3105 2018-03-26 17:32:42 I need to really do an oil change and my struts 
3106 2018-03-26 17:32:30 @lisamurkowski Noticed your strategy is to only focus on Alaska and ignore the rest of U.S.  Go ahead and say you are for oil drilling on our coasts.  You are a horrible, selfish politician.
3107 2018-03-26 17:32:26 And its people. Can you imagine going to a hospital that uses no oil-based products? Glass IV bottles & gum rubber tubing. They’re happy to use the proceeds of oil as long as everyone else does the dirty work.
3108 2018-03-26 17:32:12 Let’s march in the streets. Liberals do.  Squeaky wheel gets the oil
3109 2018-03-26 17:32:09 Think about term structure as demand for oil storage. Contango = high demand for storage & backwardation = low demand for storage. 

Steeper backwardation = even lower demand for storage. The new forward curve means increased urgency to sell rather than store oil.

3111 2018-03-26 17:32:04 Hi Garry.  I stood up in Calgary in early October 2015 at the Royalty Review panel Open House and predicted that oil production in Canada w/b shut in due to regulatory burdens and lack of transportation options. David Mowat mocked me until I called him out for not answering ??'s

3125 2018-03-26 17:30:25 Doing therapy notes for clients while getting my oil changed.... really not feeling adulting today.
3126 2018-03-26 17:30:09 I can keep going, i know over 400 people who was on prescription drugs, they take NONE anymore, due to cannabis oil. NONE, not a single one. This is now indirect genocide of addicts and it's disgusting, head in sand?
3127 2018-03-26 17:30:07 That is why you are still waiting for an oil spill since 1953 while ghost gear kills everything in waters around you?
3128 2018-03-26 17:29:54 Ur head get oil 
3129 2018-03-26 17:29:42 The Chinese today opened up the commodity exchange to trade oil and  their currency ,the yuan or gold for purchase of oil. This directly threants the petrodollar dollar . Or the US hegemony in the trade of oil. Which all the wars are about ...
3130 2018-03-26 17:29:41 Consider the complexity of the “eye” that it is an irreducible design unable to create itself… (no hydrogen-to-humans). Also young coal, young oil, DNA in dinosaur bones, overwhelming evidence of a world-wide flood, evidence of design everywhere.
3131 2018-03-26 17:29:38 Here's another tip which happened to me today..... Don't wait until your customer checks out to let them know that VAT isn't included in the price of your product!! Be upfront about your costs  Has put me off ordering with them now #indiehour
3132 2018-03-26 17:29:31 Which is why 55 of our Senators voted AGAINST stopping the US's part in this genocide. It's all about the money that Big Oil puts in their pockets. It's also why they tolerate our war of aggression against Syria.
3133 2018-03-26 17:29:30 Not soon, but the real problem is that oil is gradually falling to disuse. Countries with half a brain are moving fast towards clean energy.
3134 2018-03-26 17:29:20 My first was a 70 Mach I. Bought it in Kentucky and drove it to California for Army language school when I came back from Thailand. Got it to 120 going across Mojave desert. Still had lotsa pedal left. Traded it for new Fiat during Arab oil embargo. Dumbest move I ever made...
3135 2018-03-26 17:29:20 Am I the only one whose skin reacts negatively to coconut oil?
3136 2018-03-26 17:29:05 Come in for a oil change ... end up spending 500 smh
3137 2018-03-26 17:28:55 The way I read latest Speculative Market Positioning (CFTC) from Longview Economics suggests being long Silver, Wheat, 5Y Note and 3M Eurodollar. Short Oil. Not sure what MSA makes of that.
3138 2018-03-26 17:28:51 U can..... in a few years times it be oil rich city
3139 2018-03-26 17:28:44 It's a very good question you are asking. Sadly @ElizabethMay will not answer. Her statement infers diluted bitumen is worse than light oil in a pipeline. Much like climate change skeptics, she just keeps saying something as if it's a fact without ever backing it up.
3140 2018-03-26 17:28:43 You put oil in it?
3141 2018-03-26 17:28:42 has anyone written an ode to the oil meme because if not I volunteer
3142 2018-03-26 17:28:41 Bathe me in kombucha, lau me in arugula, and drizzle me with olive oil before sending me to my Viking burial at sea
3143 2018-03-26 17:28:40 I think it’s her right as a citizen to protest and get arrested if she likes. However when she is currently being paid by tax money raised predominantly by oil and gas to be an MP she has to make better choices. She isn’t there to break laws, she’s there to uphold the laws. Quit

3145 2018-03-26 17:28:29 The study used essential oil constituents, not a true essential oil. The study did NOT look at a complete oil, only extracts of  eucalyptol, 4-terpineol, dipentene/limonene and alpha-terpineol, linalyl acetate, linalool, alpha-terpinene and gamma-terpinene. Get the facts!!!

3152 2018-03-26 17:27:36 Dealership picked up my car for an oil change today. 

Day after a competition weekend. 


3153 2018-03-26 17:27:33 Dude cbd oil is almost shocking when you see / feel the results. I just started using it on my dogs this week too, suuuch a positive change.
3154 2018-03-26 17:27:32 I bet the guy under my car changing my oil right now is thinking “man this girl really hates her car”
3155 2018-03-26 17:27:19 From the same man who responded to the 1979 Oil Crisis by turning down the temperature and wearing a sweater.
3156 2018-03-26 17:27:14 I really only tweeted that because I’m getting an oil change is this is one of the first times I didn’t tell my dad I was lol he said one time “I think your husband knows. He’s a pretty alright guy” and that sealed it for me. I’m spoiled real bad
3157 2018-03-26 17:27:11 America need to sell their gas and oil to the nations that support Russia at prices that will be too low for them to compete...the marketplace  the sure winner for bullying

3161 2018-03-26 17:27:00 Just applied vitamin e oil to my face hehe it’s over for you bitches soon :) watch me
3162 2018-03-26 17:26:57 Look at what Burnaby's doing. They're stepping up to Kinder Morgan and are refusing to let a permanent injunction get in their way. I'm proud of their courage to protest a huge oil company in Texas, and we're fed up with American influence disrupting our culture.
3163 2018-03-26 17:26:50 It better. Bought some Clicks hot oil treatment sachets. TRESemme heat defence and some Clicks Hair Rescue Overnight Therapy. I need my hair back into silky straight form.

John Frieda was on 3 for 2 but still could not afford it. 
3164 2018-03-26 17:26:33 Oklahoma can't decide if we are in the Midwest or the South, but there is a cowboy museum close to my home! Does that count for anything? We also drink oil here

3169 2018-03-26 17:25:51 Fair enough and well put.  But the antitrust suit did not end vertical integration in the oil industry — instead it merely birthed the seven sisters — while the rule of reason helped make Bork’s jurisprudence possible — in short Tarbell helped legitimate managerial capitalism

3175 2018-03-26 17:25:32 Pipeline build by business not by taxpayers.
One key to CO2 emissions is getting the 98% of vehicles that burn fossil fuels off the road.
We need oil until then.

3176 2018-03-26 17:25:32 That’s true. I hear good things for CBD oil for a lot of stuff. I don’t think you fail drug tests for it and it doesn’t get you high
3177 2018-03-26 17:25:18 I’m feelin’ real iffy about an oil man being the new OU president... 
3178 2018-03-26 17:25:12 Seems to me that oil/gas companies have to invest where there’s oil and gas. JS
3179 2018-03-26 17:25:11 Shell's "climate" scenario sees world oil and gas use continuing at today's levels till 2050. To square the numbers, it relies on carbon being sucked out of atmosphere later with new technology that's yet to be invented #OilGoalsNotParisGoals
3180 2018-03-26 17:25:10 Dear Ghaith..two major errors in your article. First Sabha is not the largest oil field. Second the Tebu have been Haftar‘s main backers from day one. To say that Haftar wants to Arabize the oil fields is ludicrous. Please do more research. With respect.

3183 2018-03-26 17:24:53 Thanks babe. I use the Tumeric soap twice a day (morning & evening) followed by Micellar water from Garnier as a toner (the 1 for sensitive skin) - I moisturise with the Pure Luxe Rosehip oil in the evening. In the morning I apply the Rosehip oil followed by sunscreen.
3184 2018-03-26 17:24:48 The very best part of today was taking the Sacrament, reserved from this morning's Chrism Eucharist, to one of our clergy who is unwell, and anointing him & his wife with the fresh oil of healing.  It was a huge privilege to hear his renewal of commitment to ministry. #Thankful
3185 2018-03-26 17:24:37 I’ve healed many things in my life with the magical oil of the coconut. Be warned; it does nothing for a panic attack but make your panic smell like a pina colada. Mixed messages. V. Confusing. #coconutoil #anxietyproblems #panic #MondayMotivaton #limeinthecoconut

3192 2018-03-26 17:23:17 Palm oil on beach here so can't talk little dog on 
3193 2018-03-26 17:23:12 I had a dream last night that a guy told me I had rough elbows. Now I’m all worried slapping hella oil and lotion on them.
3194 2018-03-26 17:23:12 Ala. Boleh je beli AHA + BHA tu dulu. *hasut* Takpe. Yang penting aku tahu kau tak beli barang yg ada mineral oil dah.
3195 2018-03-26 17:22:29 I've even put couscous + pesto mix (or dried basil + garlic powder) + parm. cheese + sliced dried tomatoes in a bag, and that's pretty shelf-stable (or would keep a long-ass time in the freezer) — add olive oil or butter (or garlic butter!) and boiling water, wait 5 min: food.
3196 2018-03-26 17:22:25 良いとこ決まればいいですけどね…
3197 2018-03-26 17:22:21 You were also the penasihat for Petronas. Tell me, why did you arahkan MAS to buy oil from Petron sahaja? To make your anak anak rich? You hentam kerajaan tak boleh mansuhkan tol, tapi you yang buat? Abolish GST and pergi balik ke SST? How dumb is that?
3198 2018-03-26 17:22:21 you can use almond, coconut or even olive oil (or any good vegetable oil for skin) on a cottom :)
3199 2018-03-26 17:22:16 It is a disaster for public perception of "natural gas" that somehow it scored the word "natural" in it's name. As if instead of petroleum it were "natural oil".
3200 2018-03-26 17:22:05 Just got a oil change Saturday and there’s no oil in my car today
3201 2018-03-26 17:21:57 Anybody I follow use oil paint? Im using it on a digital application but I’m sure it’s the same concept for the question I want to ask

3205 2018-03-26 17:21:46 it's 2025, society is polarized
in one camp are the analytical philosophers, in the other are the continental
the conflict is purely ideological and

but on the core of this divide is one question

3209 2018-03-26 17:21:26 Venezuela is 51st in the 2018 EPI from Yale, just ahead of Russia and light years ahead of China (where you want to sell our oil). Venezuela is ahead of most oil producing countries. Saudi Arabia does middling on the EPI, ranking with Serbia, Chile, Ecuador.  is at 25th.

3213 2018-03-26 17:20:55 Why don't Oilcompanies take a realistic stance and state that gas is better than oil & both are better than coal in terms of pollution. Oh and by pollution I don't mean CO2 which is plant food and has no discernible effect on the climate

3227 2018-03-26 17:19:13 A ridiculous question. Busts are when the Heritage Trust Fund comes into play and the NDP arrived in power one year after the oil-price plummet began (mid-2014). If the fiscal regime didn't generate a surplus when oil prices were high, then it certainly won't in busts.

3232 2018-03-26 17:18:37 No worries! The Canadian dollar used to be only 2 cents lower than the US dollar but it kinda took a dive when oil prices went down and now Trump is driving even more into the ground all on his own  it’s $1.29 Cad to for $1.00 US right now.

3344 2018-03-26 17:03:01 FYI for seed allergy parents: the “vitamin e” listed within ingredients is very likely from sunflower oil 

Same with “natural flavor”, whatever that is supposed to mean.

3347 2018-03-26 17:02:43 Maybe the reduction  in  trade  deficit has to do with increased domestic  production  of oil.

3357 2018-03-26 17:01:19 You do realize he was a Democrat his entire life until 2015, right?  He is a known pathological liar and yet you choose to believe THIS version of Trump? He is the ultimate snake oil salesman. Open your mind and do the research to find out the truth.

3360 2018-03-26 17:00:59 The foolish ones took their lamps but did not take any oil with them. The wise ones, however, took oil in jars along with their lamps. Matt 25:3-4 NIV

Wisdom is lived out, not talked about. The choice to be prepared is ours to make.

3361 2018-03-26 17:00:58 Maybe we should continue to import oil from the middle east because you think they are more honest than us.

3375 2018-03-26 16:59:25 You only need a couple oil machines
3376 2018-03-26 16:59:19 @POTUS Mr President, You have stated that we are oil independent now. We have the best supply in many years. WHY then, are gas prices in Arizona going up so much? This can only be price gouging since supply is great and demand has NOT CHANGED. What are you doing about this?

3384 2018-03-26 16:57:45 The reason why it didnt work as well in Venezuela was due to several factors. 

firstly there was an oil crash shortly after it's nationalisation.

secondly all of the Venezuelan big buisnesses jumper ship when the state didnt want to play ball.

third the US placing embargos

3387 2018-03-26 16:57:17 Asheville and the People's Republic of Durham are very liberal, Charlotte a bit less so. The rest of the state is pretty conservative.

3390 2018-03-26 16:57:10 They're after Iran oil. Iraq must be running dry. Billions of barrels stolen by UK USA France. And they're probably keeping sweet Libyan oil for their bomber jets.
3391 2018-03-26 16:57:01 Well, you can use 99 of it for the Adventurer Bundle, also you can make slime eggs out of it which sell for an okayish price and i think you need it for the oil machine which is a cool one.

The ost actually is the same of hau oil city but reverse version -
3398 2018-03-26 16:56:39 Better get this FTC on this. Information trade > oil trade.
3399 2018-03-26 16:56:38 There is an urgent need to stop subsidizing the fossil fuel industry, dramatically reduce wasted energy, and significantly shift our power supplies from oil, coal, and natural gas to wind, solar, geothermal, and other renewable energy sources...

3403 2018-03-26 16:55:45 They are selling snake oil as medicine after it's been sprayed with harmful chemicals. It's making people more sick. There are no regs on it
3404 2018-03-26 16:55:37 Lol! It’s basically swishing coconut oil in your mouth. It’s really great for your teeth & gums, but it’s pretty gross.

3411 2018-03-26 16:54:16 Weary of saying this but hemp is most useful plant on earth & fools, fearful of it reducing oil & steel profits, have had it banned for over a century. History will not treat 20th Century kindly. #Hemp
3412 2018-03-26 16:54:16 THANKS! I was thinking stud, then olive oil herb paste, fridge uncovered for 24hrs to dry. Foil and roast at you said at 325 for 15 min/lb, then uncover and jack up to 500 for 20 mins. Let rest for min 30 mins. Sound good for mid-rare?
3413 2018-03-26 16:54:12 Oven on. Two veggie sausages (even when I was a meat-eater, these were very helpful), one red onion, cut into quarters, one tomato, cut into quarters. Oil, salt, pepper. 15 mins, 200C. If you feel up to it, some broccoli or other green veg on the stove.
3414 2018-03-26 16:54:04 Using our taxpayer funded military to protect our oil assets is not fair...Exxon must contribute.
3415 2018-03-26 16:53:26 Fry the lamb in the oil in batches and tip it into the slow cooker. Fry the onion in the same pan for 5 mins or until it softens a little. Add the carrots and spices, stir everything together, add the tomato purée, stock and 250ml water and swirl everything around the pan.
3416 2018-03-26 16:53:16 I was skeptical too! The vet advised us to give her 6-8 weeks to she how it healed on its own without surgery. We got her those treats and some oil for her food and she’s great now

3419 2018-03-26 16:52:51 @RichardHaass So have you paid attention since Trumps trip to middle east when Saudi agreed to increase oil output and Trumps trip to poland where he agreed to deals to supply Baltic states with LNG which Russia used to supply, Trump is crippling Russia's economy you dufus!
3420 2018-03-26 16:52:50 Pruitt has led the way in denying climate change, global warming, rolling back regulations that protect our water, air and land. All for money from oil, gas and mining conglomerates. 
Guessing he doesn’t care what kind of world his grandkids will live in.
3421 2018-03-26 16:52:44 All the States (Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Rivers, Delta, Ondo, Cross River, Imo, Edo &amp; Abia) in the Niger Delta in Nigeria have crude oil reserves
3422 2018-03-26 16:52:43 Sounds like they need to build in one day per rotation that is your appointment day. People need to change the oil in their car and get a haircut too.
3423 2018-03-26 16:52:39 Hemp is not the same as pot.  It have a very tiny bit of THC  in it & even if you smoke the leaves , you don’t get any high or effects from it. It’s not any worse than smoking something like basil leaves.   It has many medical uses the same a tea tree oil.
3424 2018-03-26 16:52:38 My teacher was telling us that she started her weekend or spring break with an explosion on her property - an oil rig exploded on the west end.

I checked right out of the conversation then. I know it was her late husband's business & family businesses are important out here but
3425 2018-03-26 16:52:37 I hate it when your inner schizo shows.

3427 2018-03-26 16:52:26 You imply changing the voting system is a flip of a switch.  Name the countries using a different system.  It's not a cure-all.  I believe Trudeau is not as pro-pipeline as you suggest.  Getting that dirty oil to tidewater is probably not feasible in the end.
3428 2018-03-26 16:52:20 Shell only foresees possible futures that help its own business. 

This scenario sees oil & gas consumption staying flat for decades. It'd blow past the 1.5°C limit, and might keep us below 2°C only if magical tech is invented to suck vast amounts of CO2 out of the atmosphere.

3430 2018-03-26 16:52:08 Translated: US, Saudi and UAE national security advisors met to discuss countermeasures to Venezuela, Russia, Iran, and China circumventing USD oil trade settlement.

3432 2018-03-26 16:51:41 My face is usually clear w minimal skincare effort, but I’ve realized if I put ANY type of oil on it I will definitely break out  less is more for me w the skincare routines lol.

3439 2018-03-26 16:50:50 Canada should be selling oil to China in exchange for manufactured goods.  Stop selling highly discounted oil to the US.
3440 2018-03-26 16:50:49 We gave our dog Dharma CBD oil treats after she hurt her leg and it really made a noticeable difference.
3441 2018-03-26 16:50:36 Paris goal isn't staying below 2º – it's staying /well/ below 2º & striving for 1.5º.

Shell's new scenario won't help reach these goals. It shows oil & gas consumption at or above 2017 levels for decades, & achieves a reasonable chance at 2º only w/ massive negative emissions.

3447 2018-03-26 16:49:54 That’s what I’m saying. Focus on those and stop throwing money at oil. A president of a university sitting on the board of an oil company and demanding the state seismologist to not publish data would be a scandal anywhere else. But in OK it’s Oil Uber Alles.
3448 2018-03-26 16:49:49 .@lorrainemichael says separating financially disastrous Muskrat Falls project from lucrative oil and gas line of business is probably not just for optics. Asks if this is the first step in preparing to sell and privatize the Muskrat Falls Project? #nlpoli
3449 2018-03-26 16:49:27 Look at recipes for things like pancakes.  Starch/sugar >>> veg oil.  Also, there is really cool recent data on particle size of flour and rate of digestion.  A little bigger particle sized flour makes your gut work a lot harder than fine flour.
3450 2018-03-26 16:49:24 Any idea when the Chrome+ oil will be available again??
3451 2018-03-26 16:49:22 bade saab , First tell us how much oil prices you will be reducing to night? Pravachan baad mein dedenaa!!
3452 2018-03-26 16:48:47 Oh yeah.  This is part of my talk at AAG in two weeks about the oil and gas publicity campaign in this state (they've cemented the discourse, basically).  I wonder if I'll be censored now, too?
3453 2018-03-26 16:48:45 I certainly hope you are correct. If not, this could turn really ugly really fast. Especially if the Yuan for Oil scheme continues or expands.

3455 2018-03-26 16:48:26 Lorraine Michael asks if Muskrat Falls will become a standalone Crown corporation when Nalcor is broken up. Premier says all will be revealed in budget, but this is about government's Advance 2030 plan for oil industry. #nlpoli
3456 2018-03-26 16:48:25 OU announced an oil dude as our new prez today. Guess UT feels like they have to surpass us.
3457 2018-03-26 16:48:25 A few days ago, the #Houthi militia had published on its website that it had attacked Saudi oil company Aramco. A blatant LIE, but one that reveals their determination and desire to wreak havoc in #KSA and of course, provoke caution or a response. #Yemen
3458 2018-03-26 16:48:23 She has a point. All those old home remedies that they used to give us. Remember 666? Castor oil?
3459 2018-03-26 16:48:14 Yum, that Republican flavored KoolAide must taste great. BTW, it was the expense of the Republican war for Iraqi oil that caused the increase in debt. Just because Obama recognized it, and reported it to the American people, he wasn't responsible for it.

3461 2018-03-26 16:48:09 Someone should beat the parents and pour hot oil on them. These people are sub human.
3462 2018-03-26 16:48:01 I used to get my oil from them, they’re spot on
3463 2018-03-26 16:47:54 like, think of it: the US wants to start a war w a country in asia bc of their oil resources and starts backing militias to destabilize the country, anti-imperialists will come up w an analysis, whereas liberal anti-war activists will say "we don't want war and americans to die"
3464 2018-03-26 16:47:41 what do u do with the oil
filling a pot with oil seems really fuckin wasteful
3465 2018-03-26 16:47:39 Where can I buy castor oil though?And all those beard products.
I need my beard to glow.
3466 2018-03-26 16:47:34 oil is not the only contributing sector to our GDP, We would evolve and diversify the economy more effectively.
i don't think we would run out of oil though
3467 2018-03-26 16:47:30 Awesome ...enough BS! let’s get our oil and LNG to shoreline ASAP!
3468 2018-03-26 16:47:28 fry everything in vegetable oil
3469 2018-03-26 16:47:23 That will never happen.  Trump is such close buddies with the Saudis even though the 9/11 attackers came mainly from Saudi Arabia.  They are sitting on the world's largest oil reservoir.
3470 2018-03-26 16:47:18 Resource bonanza durumu var. Sağlam oil kaynağı bulmuşlar ama hiçbirini kendileri çıkaramamış abd firmaları çıkarmış
3471 2018-03-26 16:47:15 In HOA, @lorrainemichael says pre-budget leak says government plans to break up Nalcor Energy in order to separate Muskrat Falls project from oil and gas line of business. Asks Premier if he plans to make the Muskrat Falls Project a stand-alone Crown corporation as well? #nlpoli
3472 2018-03-26 16:47:12 I love how as soon as I quit my job my windshield cracked, oil leak got worse, and my check engine light came on:)))))
3473 2018-03-26 16:47:12 Sooo I got a phone call today... my mother is officially selling CBD oil.
3474 2018-03-26 16:47:02 A Scots pound would have left the UK pound in the dust, still could, and not just due to Oil & Gas exports...
3475 2018-03-26 16:46:58 So much better to make your own, you can put in all the things you like and control the sweeteners and oil 
3476 2018-03-26 16:46:41 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
3477 2018-03-26 16:45:58 It helps support their large social programs. Venezuela nationalized oil as well. Why didn't it work there?

Plus, have any of you stopped to think about the fact that all of these aformentioned countries are literally like a 50th the size of the US

3479 2018-03-26 16:45:18 2007 was a totally different oil era . The western oil hubs are losing relevance rapidly. Futures need liquidity and this might be the answer
3480 2018-03-26 16:45:15 Sorry to barge in on your party with Shell @UNFCCC but Shell only have profits from oil & gas in mind, perhaps you could bear that in mind next time you want to jump on their propaganda bandwagon

Deeds not empty words. Please. We have no time for Shell’s obfuscations.

3493 2018-03-26 16:44:09 coconut milk is better than virgin coconut oil and fresh coconut is better than coconut milk. Coconut-fiber = milk - water = virgin oil. If you like fresh coconut or milk topping in your food, no need to pay extra for virgin coconut oil. #Kerala

3518 2018-03-26 16:41:08 I am tired of the government officials being owned by special interest groups, such as big Pharma, big tobacco, oil companies, and the NRA. No one group is more to blame than the other, but they should all be held responsible for their actions. And get special interest groups out

3536 2018-03-26 16:39:10 Yeah, their economy collapsed because their #1 export is oil.

Maybe having oil being #1 export has never been tried correctly right? You'd agree with that I'm sure.
3537 2018-03-26 16:38:29 Clove Oil is a traditional natural remedy that has been used since ancient Egypt. It has local anesthetic properties especially for teething in babies and tooth pain in general. For pain and itch of bug bites and for earache pain and nail fungus 
3538 2018-03-26 16:38:20 No. But, back in the early 50's some areas on the Southside were used as dumping grounds for old fuel, oil and such. Got into water supply maybe? But Water Dept. is supposed to be testing for those things.
3539 2018-03-26 16:38:14 You don't know how to deter Putin. You've been his bitch for decades.

A variant of the Reagan Doctrine of expanding US military strength, undercutting Russian oil exports and providing Russian adversaries with lethal weaponry will give Putin pause.

Not weak half measures.
3540 2018-03-26 16:38:10 Yes, if you don’t have much skin trouble then jojoba oil is enough. Once you go oil for skincare, you wouldn’t want to go back to those high end cream with lots of chemicals

3567 2018-03-26 16:35:47 And lets get real, budget problems at State,  are all about price of oil falling from $90 to $40 , and State has put off making the hard choices, electing to continue to have budget problems every year using stop gap measures, hoping the economy recovers soon.

3573 2018-03-26 16:35:26 A plant based diet is likely the easiest way to acquire linoleic acid in the diet. As of 2012 it has been widely understood that 4-HNE from linoleate in cell membranes facilitates DNA damage and cancer development. This was even demonstrated in several human seed oil trials.

3618 2018-03-26 16:30:29 Ugh I hated doing my oil change 
3619 2018-03-26 16:30:27 おめでとうございますー！
末永くお幸せに！
3620 2018-03-26 16:30:23 But don't use coconut oil in the winter cuz it hardens when cold and buy castor oil too
3621 2018-03-26 16:30:18 @kehawa Toi toi toi honey! Miss your Olbas oil in my pinny!!! x
3622 2018-03-26 16:30:07 that chicken pesto thing again. i think the oil has burnt me
3623 2018-03-26 16:30:07 And a bit of warm olive oil for earaches. The Vicksbaporu is king in Cuban households though. Didn’t know about the turpentine.
3624 2018-03-26 16:30:02 Just wait when barrels of oil are sold by the Euro
3625 2018-03-26 16:29:41 Says it all!
3626 2018-03-26 16:29:38 Finally got my oil change
3627 2018-03-26 16:29:33 When USA threatened Saudi on oil supply seize He replied :
"You are the one who can't live without oil. You know we come from the desert, our ancestors lived on dates and milk, and we can easily go back & live like that again!"

The rarest saudi ruler KING FAISAL.    i respect!
3628 2018-03-26 16:29:20 Sweet... but hopefully they don't like war and oil as much as Obama does.
3629 2018-03-26 16:29:18 So I ran out of my revive cream last week. Today I woke up with a huge zit! But I rubbed my Cbd oil right on it & now it’s 11 & it’s almost gone!  #hempworxlife
3630 2018-03-26 16:29:16 cantu, deva is super good too but pricey af but so are all curly hair products. Buy your coconut oil and Shea butter from a grocery stor and save ur money.
3631 2018-03-26 16:29:15 "Hod"?
3632 2018-03-26 16:28:58 Is it in oil? If so that’s ok with me
3633 2018-03-26 16:28:51 nobody said anything about adding just vinegar, although if it's balsamic vinegar that's good enough with some olive oil
3634 2018-03-26 16:28:41 I’ve started putting lavender essential oil on my wrists so when I meet people  it can ease any anxiety that they may have.... and make them tell me all of their secrets
3635 2018-03-26 16:28:36 Another Omen for oil :)
3636 2018-03-26 16:28:17 Ok my pal gave me this chia and jojoba oil bullshit that's supposed to help me clear my breakouts so like, let's see how that goes. Will my face puff up like a balloon? Most likely. If not? Well idk
3637 2018-03-26 16:28:09 my dad cracks me up, he gave me blackseed oil cause he was concerenced about my skin care routine
3638 2018-03-26 16:28:07 WTI oil at $65.80/barrel, near unchanged.
3639 2018-03-26 16:27:57 £400 for a thousand litres? That's about 10p a litre less than I pay for mine - anybody know where they get their oil from?
3640 2018-03-26 16:27:54 Thanks for reaching out, @ByrnesPizza. Our Baked chips have been discontinued, but we'd suggest giving our Almond Oil line a try!
3641 2018-03-26 16:27:45 O&G having a hard time catching a break. Midstream/Pipeline companies were the safest way to play this volatile sector. New US tax laws taking a toll on the share prices. Only thing working in favor of the O&G sector is the oil price, everything else seem to be an uphill battle.
3642 2018-03-26 16:27:40 I think snake oil salesmen fits better...
3643 2018-03-26 16:27:25 Canadians not known as innovators. It is dumb to not exploit one’s natural God given advantages. The world need oil & gas or tourism or fancy residential properties or food or wood products and Alberta and B.C. can provide it all. It’s the job of politicians to provide ..
3644 2018-03-26 16:27:04 What is the supply cap on CPU sales or production? Cereals? Baseballs? Carpets? Bicycles?

OPEC was an oil cartel that artificially limited production to increase prices in, what, the 70s? That was centralized control by a distributed entity. Consensus doesn't change economics.
3645 2018-03-26 16:27:03 I am also completely sure that many academics could do a much better job that your average oil executive. What training do you really need to become an "oil executive"?
3646 2018-03-26 16:26:55 i hate when i’m at subway & i tell the fucking lady to put A LOTTTT of oil & vinegar & she still puts A LITTTTTTLE. bitchhhhh wtf did i say??! 
3647 2018-03-26 16:26:39 That sounds tasty! I definitely notice a difference in energy levels with mct oil, if you haven't tried it before it is definitely worth trying. I still use coconut oil for baking because I love the flavour.

3652 2018-03-26 16:26:09 Very sore but I’m functioning, hoping my medication comes today. I was reading and I’m going to try a detox bath to see if it will calm down the inflammation; it consists of pink Himalayan salt or  epsom salt & lavender oil  and 1/2 cup of baking soda.

3662 2018-03-26 16:25:13 how many know today China started an oil bourse  buying oil in gold backed petro Yuan ? Everything in the news today is because of this but no MSM even mentions it. Next is trade war..then real war. unavoidable now.
3663 2018-03-26 16:25:07 You're welcome, Iris. I see you're burning the midnight oil. You might have seen I posted this on Facebook, too. I might do LinkedIn as well.
3664 2018-03-26 16:25:04 Don't step on the oil slick.
3665 2018-03-26 16:25:04 I hate doing the dishes and then having to deal with that one tiny bowl full of used cooking oil that has been there the past week because no one else wanted to touch it.

3672 2018-03-26 16:24:04 I was told my oil change would be done by 9. It’s almost 12:30.
3673 2018-03-26 16:24:03 I forgot to put coconut oil on the rest of my leg 
3674 2018-03-26 16:23:47 Rosehip oil doesn’t smell so bad to me, or maybe i just get used to it. You should try tamanu oil then, it has stronger smell than rosehip. I have to mix it with jojoba oil and a tiny bit of lavender eo to use it.
3675 2018-03-26 16:23:39 Dark side meaning CGY & oil industries? I've seen a number of guidelines and vision from CGY that looks pretty progressive and geared towards a livable city.

3681 2018-03-26 16:22:45 “Birth control has side effects!” 

Yes girl, so does Tylenol and lavender and tea tree oil. 

Pipe down.

3692 2018-03-26 16:21:58 In Germany, there is the "50 + 1" rule, whereby a club has to have a controlling stake so that commercial interests (such as oil oligarchs) can't gain control of a club through massive investment.

3694 2018-03-26 16:21:44 Crude oil futures trading almost flat but mixed. Losses capped by a rebound in stock markets and escalating Saudi-Iran tensions.
3695 2018-03-26 16:21:22 Trees are renewable resources, coal and oil is not
3696 2018-03-26 16:21:21 Wel netjes wassen daarna. En daarna een beetje oil, want volgens Leco schijnt het dan weer, zo.meldde mij de collega met baard/snor.
3697 2018-03-26 16:21:15 If you ever saw the policies for Libyan people that were in place before the US ruined the country, you'd see that Gaddafi was making Africa prosperous. He only got targeted because he was outspoken against the US empire & had large oil reserves.
3698 2018-03-26 16:21:11 I wish I was there in the back garden rubbing oil all over them tits mate
3699 2018-03-26 16:20:53 Buy oil.
3700 2018-03-26 16:20:47 My tip for cooking: if it doesn’t seem to be going right, add a bit more oil.
3701 2018-03-26 16:20:45 Massage them under warm water w salt if they are tough. Lemon and or lime and olive oil and salt and vinegar. Maybe roast some curry cauliflower and chickpeas for a delicious crunch.
3702 2018-03-26 16:20:35 And if you want to, you can add some decarbed kief/hash/hash oil to the mixture to make your souffle medicated.
3703 2018-03-26 16:20:32 GUYS GUYS GUYS -
Take it easy on Jack. He's not what you'd call "the smartest". 
It's why the NRA and oil companies love this guy
3704 2018-03-26 16:20:32 Also water isn’t lube. But cooking oil is
3705 2018-03-26 16:20:31 The Iraq oil ministry will carry out maintenance work at SPM-3, part of the Basrah oil terminal in April, sources told @PlattsOil They expect exports to be cut by as much as 10 million barrels in April. #OPEC #OOTT #IRAQ
3706 2018-03-26 16:20:30 those numbers are never shown this technology gains.  so yes.. we have had substantial declines in legacy wells for decades.. its a great talking point and its real but there are substantial gains outside of the general oil growth areas everyone talks about like US.
3707 2018-03-26 16:20:17 Govt protects Muslims because of Barcelona treaty 1975, Barcelona declaration 1995 and because it’s pro EU. Started with the oil crisis 1974, blackmailed by OPEC. But now EU objective too. Coudenhove Kalergi plan.
3708 2018-03-26 16:20:12 with the way Putin ran roughshod over Lil Barack Obama youda thought he had something on Obama!  At least @realDonaldTrump is doing many things to fight Russia wrt oil prices, Syria, Ukraine, etc.

3725 2018-03-26 16:18:58 No thank you. I've decided to end my relationship with that particular dealership. They left me sitting there for 2 hours until the dealership finally closed & I had to hunt someone down to see if/when my car would be ready. They had finished the oil change and failed to tell me.

3732 2018-03-26 16:17:45 Very slowly so we won’t notice. Prices are up an average of $.65 from same time last year. Too much other news distractions so oil companies can take huge profits
3733 2018-03-26 16:17:39 I like the chart on $OIL  - especially if it can break above Friday's highs. Thanks for bringing this one to my attention. ;)

3766 2018-03-26 16:14:36 That's so interesting; i never knew an allergy existed on that level and yeah it's ridiculous how people have to go up and down the country with oil because they don't wanna regulate it. It's already an industry it's just underground, madness these laws.

3771 2018-03-26 16:14:18 I MISS ROASTING CHICKEN. Stuff thyme and bay leaves and loads of garlic and half a lemon in the cavity. Smear whole thing with olive oil/butter. Sea salt flakes scattered over the skin. Keep going back to the oven to baste it. At the end drain the liquid from it and remove some
3772 2018-03-26 16:14:11 Once you start doing some math, jealousy + envy + greed, then they're (prosecution) cooking with more hot oil. Going kinda biblical now. Always a great way to stir the pot more, if all genuine evidence shows otherwise (accidental death).
3773 2018-03-26 16:14:09 @AustinWSelf is done for the day due to an oil line busting and @driverfontaine is out as well from a wreck.

3780 2018-03-26 16:12:41 Bombs are regulated? Tell that to the Austin bomber. Those who bombed the Murrah Fed building using fuel oil and fertilizer. Sarnoff brothers who did the Boston bombing had no clue about "regulations". True that machine guns are against the law to sell but plenty of them owned.

3811 2018-03-26 16:08:48 Fish Oil is only garbage if it’s low quality and you don’t take a proper dose of EPA/DHA.  And if Fish Oil is , why are there Rx Drug equivalents of Fish Oil, aka Lovaza and Omacor?  Buy high quality O3 that give you 1-2gms of EPA/DHA.
3812 2018-03-26 16:08:45 Is it now. So we can expect to see some good news stories about all the recent oil finds in the North Sea and the fields that have just come on-line.
3813 2018-03-26 16:08:38 I don't know that it's really practical, but if my landlord evicts me I found this workaway in a guest house on a Greek island where they'll teach you to Greek as well as how to make wine and olive oil in exchange for help gardening. It's a comforting idea.

3835 2018-03-26 16:05:39 I think it would be "fair and balanced" if some random academics now started getting selected for a few oil executive positions... 
3836 2018-03-26 16:05:37 But is that betting on oil price or getting exposure to something else? If refiners are looking for delivery and the opposite side of the transaction looking for something else, could get very messy if refiners refuse to close their positions.

3880 2018-03-26 16:01:03 China is the top importer mainly because its oil production is low, therefore relying heavily on imported oil (increasingly from the US, which has an oil boom and doesn't need much imported oil)

3916 2018-03-26 15:56:48 I, for one, am quite concerned about big oil having disproportionate influence in Oklahoma policy and education.  I hope Gallogly will focus entirely on higher education, and not furthering his past constituency.

3940 2018-03-26 15:54:04 Just as a colander separates cooked pasta from water, the oil filter traps dirt that would otherwise harm your engine. Make sure you're getting it replaced when needed. Contact Solution Tire for a diagnostic. #oilfilter #engine #autorepair

3943 2018-03-26 15:53:44 Rep. Eric Smith says he can support legalizing hemp oil with 0 THC. A product on market would need 20% THC, he said, for people to want to buy it. #ksleg

3946 2018-03-26 15:53:24 Donations shouldn’t even be considered for running a university. It’s just another sign of oil’s grip on the state. OCU named an oil exec as president and our schools have no money so oil execs could have income and GPT tax breaks. We have to diversify.

Seems they want total domination for America & the EU.

Alberta’s only Oil customer is USA via pipeline who then sell oil back to Ontario & Quebec who also buy tanker oil from Saudi Sheiks & Venezuela’s Dictator. Even more insane -Ont & Que have been receiving “have notwelfare money” from Alberta’s Oil sales
3990 2018-03-26 15:48:51 Because they didn't want the civilians dead, obviously! They wanted the country to be able to get back up on its feet afterwards, so they could start getting that oil. Dead people can't work!
3991 2018-03-26 15:48:48 If China is the top importer but not the top consumer, where is the excess oil going? Is it stored? Is it shipped to North Korea? China’s practices r so opaque that it distorts the markets of commodities in general. You don’t know how much is out there.
3992 2018-03-26 15:48:45 Now we're talking. I think Maduro's oil-crypto-currency, needless to say in combination with with an oil-yuan-gold-futures-paper-tool, will crush the evil evil ponzi artists. #;-)

4041 2018-03-26 15:42:31 Have you ever left coconut oil in your hair while bleaching it? It reduces damage a lot
4042 2018-03-26 15:42:26 Maybe it's because I've started lifting but three drumsticks cooked with little to no oil and mashed potatoes instead of bread is not that much, I'd consider it a decent meal.

4044 2018-03-26 15:42:22 She's right because petroleum jelly is a sealant, not a moisturizer. Just like coconut oil. Look for oils that actually moisturize like avocado or get a lip product with hyloraunic acid
4045 2018-03-26 15:42:14 The US dollar is on the decline after the rise of the PetroYuan, the Chinese are now #1 in oil consuming and oil exports. Their currency is backed by gold. This is a major step towards Global Currency.

4052 2018-03-26 15:41:20 It is a real and serious problem. This in not a good time to relax our environmental protections. We can't use oil to irrigate plants.
4053 2018-03-26 15:41:12 Are you suffering from chronic pain?  Headaches? Joint pain? Stop in for CBD oil. Hemp and olive oil based CBD oil helps reduce inflammation naturally without side effects or drug interactions. Since it is based from hemp, it contains no THC.

4178 2018-03-26 15:27:20 Praise God! The result of being relentless in the pursuit of precious souls for Christ. Let the oil continue to flow from above. This is God’s revolution, change is here.
4179 2018-03-26 15:27:16 Someone on my feed was asking about body lotion for dry skin and I asked around and the two top results from my skincare pals were Amlactin (which can be supplemented with argan oil) or Eucerin. Hope that helps! I couldn’t find the tweet I meant to reply to!
4180 2018-03-26 15:27:13 Let it groooooow, let it groooooow, get some oil and let it groooooow
4181 2018-03-26 15:26:59 Here’s the plan. Right now, Russia is getting oil through a pipeline in Crimea. They have to pay taxes on it. If they can get everyone else fighting amongst themselves, there won’t be a unified response when Russia invaded Crimea. To that end, they’re promoting chaos everywhere.
4182 2018-03-26 15:26:56 S/o to my classmate for telling her boyfriend to hook me up with an oil change at Honda 
4183 2018-03-26 15:26:55 The case for independence collapsed with the oil price and Brexit. Your "self govern" remark relies on a perception that we are different from the rest of the people with whom we share a small island and statehood. It's a false and, frankly, distasteful perception.

4185 2018-03-26 15:26:38 It's illegal to own a gun and have a medical marijuana license.  Now we all know people are more impaired on alcohol.  Someone has a medical condition.  They are taking usually in a vape pen or pill, oil, or edible. And they are stripped of their right to protect themselves.
4186 2018-03-26 15:26:32 Because of 2 Reasons, Texas takes in huge tax revenues from oil and gas extraction so they can tax their citizens less and they don’t have a miserable winter.
4187 2018-03-26 15:26:28 It's my day off and I need to pack my room, get an oil change, do laundry, clean my bathroom, and go to the store and I physically can't bring myself to get off the couch (:
4188 2018-03-26 15:26:23 My girls, girlfriends always come to me and ask me to do their oil changes and brakes or home improvements. But they all have “boyfriends”. Like wtf you have a useless ass man by your side honestly. #valenverga

4191 2018-03-26 15:25:59 Oil and gas
4192 2018-03-26 15:25:56 I agree. There should be more women working on oil rigs and emptying bins. In the name of equality.
4193 2018-03-26 15:25:51 I put too much oil in my hair, it’s dripping down my neck and forehead.

4195 2018-03-26 15:25:41 We have a few states that have larger economies than Russian... Russia's economy is dependent on gas and oil... Russia is weak and feeble..

4197 2018-03-26 15:25:19 Generally, that the NL government doesn't control its own resources (on land and offshore oil and gas). It controls all of them. On the fish side, it never did.

4204 2018-03-26 15:24:53 I’m seeing these excuses about the start of the year everywhere now. It’s unbelievable. “If talbot” or “if tmac put nuge there” I even saw “If Connor was healthy”. Theyre fixin to let chia off the hook and ignore the massive flaws this team has.

4210 2018-03-26 15:24:11 And the Russians probably aren't all that torn up over this in reality.  It's largely symbolic.  The only thing they truly care about is their oil and gas export revenue.
4211 2018-03-26 15:24:10 Hey pals! Appointing an oil executive with no academic job experience & a history of enormous donations as your university president is a travesty!! I'm even more ashamed of my alma mater than I was already!

4214 2018-03-26 15:23:50 Wearing the US military uniform today means killing innocents abroad to facilitate greater corporate profits for big oil, weapons makers, rare metal seekers. Totally immoral. Better to flip burgers or drive Uber than sign up to slaughter noncombatants. What if they gave a war and
4215 2018-03-26 15:23:45 Curious whether these findings make lavender and tea tree essential oils w/their estrogen-like properties - applied transdermally in a carrier oil - beneficial to women in early menopause/experiencing hot flashes. As good as transdermal progesterone, say?
4216 2018-03-26 15:23:36 Also, put food wrap on all the doors and put oil on all the knobs. Lol. And maybe food wrap the toilet seats.

4220 2018-03-26 15:23:19 Whats the seed oil for
4221 2018-03-26 15:23:15 Also, I use castor oil topically.  It can draw out deep infections.  It works differently topically than internally.
4222 2018-03-26 15:22:59 Also if you’re having trouble with hair growth and or any sort of damage, I’d highly recommend black seed oil. I had terrible breakage due to too many tight puffs. It’s helped it grow out and my hair is crazy thick now too
4223 2018-03-26 15:22:42 I’m trying to be optimistic but all I’ve heard so far is •I’m gonna be a teacher (but never taught before) •big oil! •avoided bankruptcies for foreign countries. 

OU isn’t in financial trouble. We aren’t big oil. Just saying.
4224 2018-03-26 15:22:38 I have made a passable labneh from cocomut soy yog (£1) and tofu paneer, and a nacho dip (carrot, milk, marmite, salt, mustard, more oil than i'll admit...) but anything else is a pipe dream

Once you do understand the value of knowledge, it’s simple to get more of it. Just dedicate yourself to constant learning.
4230 2018-03-26 15:21:54 So sad & this is happening under a govt that boasts of diversifying d economy through agriculture; well oil price is going up so what else?
4231 2018-03-26 15:21:50 Really!? And who cares about an oil rich spoiled brat who took everything for granted and ruined his career and peoples life's around him. Smh why is this even a worthy tweet? Oh it fits your narrative for kap. Every story turns into some kind of SJW crap or message.

4235 2018-03-26 15:21:21 @SecretaryZinke - looks like a great place to drill for oil or sell off to a friend.
4236 2018-03-26 15:21:18 Also, after some research, I found out the dealership didn’t replace the rod bearings when they replaced pistons for oil consumption usage. Sounds questionable you wouldn’t replace a part connected to another part that failed

4244 2018-03-26 15:20:46 It's 44 years old and totally irrelevant now as the oil reserves it spoke of have largely disappeared and only 15 years of profitable reserves remain.
4245 2018-03-26 15:20:42 This factoid will get hurriedly forgotten.

4259 2018-03-26 15:19:37 $XOP not sure what I'm missing, but energy went from looking great to absolutely breaking down and relative weakness very quickly. Oil double top maybe. Maybe just a little give back from last week's strength. $SPY not exactly helping either. 34 level should stop the slide.
4260 2018-03-26 15:19:15 Just wondering: Perhaps Tiffany is talking about "turpentine oil" not turpentine (what we understand as paint thinner/remover).  Look up "Turpentine oil" and you will see a variety of health benefits.
4261 2018-03-26 15:19:13 Sigh. Fine, the G7G railway is my preferred choice, as it can 1. Transfer neatbit, which doesn’t flow or burn 2. Is closest to the resource 3. can be run on hydrogen and 4. Will not become a stranded asset as the need for oil reserves declines.
4262 2018-03-26 15:19:09 No. Just let the big oil executive retire in peace. How about, oh I don't know, an EDUCATOR?!

4311 2018-03-26 15:14:16 Really? So will you stop investing in companies like Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Occidental Petroleum, ConocoPhillips, oil services company Halliburton, and in the pipeline operator Energy Transfer Partners LP?
4312 2018-03-26 15:14:03 they sent me some beard oil and if this shit works it’s over for u bitches
4313 2018-03-26 15:14:01 Gospel Jn 12:1-11

Six days before Passover Jesus came to Bethany,
where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.
They gave a dinner for him there, and Martha served,
while Lazarus was one of those reclining at table with him. 
Mary took a liter of costly perfumed oil

4317 2018-03-26 15:13:45 If you follow the story, you will see there was oil in the lamps when they took them but they didn't take extra oil.

AUV "The foolish ones did not take enough olive oil for their lamps with them,"

Not checking up on things and MAKING SURE is the bedrock of failure.

4318 2018-03-26 15:13:44 Ceo'zara, demon of oil consumption, asks whether you know anyone who can fix their totalled Field Emission Displays, which is playing up again. #Ceozara
4319 2018-03-26 15:13:38 Trying oil pulling and I wanna die
4320 2018-03-26 15:13:31 How’s the kleptocracy working out for you? Pretty cool that in 2018 80% of your economy is oil.  You are cave men.
4321 2018-03-26 15:13:26 The DOW still below 24k. FB stock drop dragging the bull market. Oil sliding. Expect another artificial bump by Koch brother insider trading of oil futures.
4322 2018-03-26 15:13:25 Then you should be in favor of halting ALL pipeline oil transported to BC, yes?
4323 2018-03-26 15:13:24 That’s common for kinder eggs Kathleen... but we really should be jist boycottin kinder products full stop... they use palm oil in ther products apparently
4324 2018-03-26 15:13:20 Hopefully I can go today if this mechanic ever gets done my damn oil change.
4325 2018-03-26 15:13:17 I have 4 hours before work...I need to bleach and wash my bundles, and get an oil change idk if I’ll get it done in time tho 
4326 2018-03-26 15:13:10 I wish King would wear the logos on his jacket of the drug, oil, and other companies that he puts before the American people.
4327 2018-03-26 15:13:05 Shidd my dad be the one that takes my car for an oil change. All I do is put gas in
4328 2018-03-26 15:13:05 Personally I cured my own depression. It had a biochemical basis that was curable through thyroid and adrenal supportive herbs and dietary changes. My partner uses fish oil to treat seasonal affective disorder quite successfully. Best wishes for your healing.
4329 2018-03-26 15:12:58 Muzzy has oil confirmed and the hype is real
4330 2018-03-26 15:12:33 $Crude $OIl $CL has broken down important support invalidating structure for immediate one more high
4331 2018-03-26 15:12:31 If there certain applications we need a certain product for that's fine but when you smear it all over the place we don't need a larger Economy based on oil we need less and it's getting in the way and so are you
4332 2018-03-26 15:12:29 I took me while and i had to crawl back but ain’t nobody give me shit! Everything i got in life i had to work hard for thank you God because i will appreciate every oil change and busted tire i have to repair
4333 2018-03-26 15:12:24 Can we tweak these to be baked?
 All that oil is bad for you and dangerous.
4334 2018-03-26 15:12:22 Hm im already thinking of chewing lamb fats and sucking oil out of the lamb meat
4335 2018-03-26 15:12:16 Tobi you get oil for head...congratulations #BBNaija
4336 2018-03-26 15:12:05 what about bath oil beads
4337 2018-03-26 15:12:04 Don't think markets are over this. Seen several charts that suggest more declines on the way; Hang Seng, KLSE, S&P, Dow, CAC, DAX, FTSE100, Oil. #predictions
4338 2018-03-26 15:11:51 That's a fair take re oil action. It doesn't feel explicitly bearish for sure, tho - I'd still argue it's more bullish environment than bearish right now. The long HF/CTA positions are in danger still of getting whacked. #OOTT
4339 2018-03-26 15:11:40 Another cold snap coming, so inevitably we’ve run out of oil. We can deliver you some middle of April says the oil company. Sigh. Heating off

4341 2018-03-26 15:11:11 Got my oil changed last month but to save money I used a coupon...this month my heat gave out & im right back at the same place paying $130 to get it fixed. MECHANICS @ CAR DEALERSHIPS ARE SUCH A FUCKING SCAM. Warranty or not FUCKING SCAMMERS.
4342 2018-03-26 15:11:09 #UJO @SPAngelNews @StuartRamsay4 @The_MadStork @nickyboy1886 @georgewilson015 @rwells123 @Jam4u_75 @leedbartz @liamgray542 @Spears07  Sing this from the roof top, Brent $70 a pop. Heading for $100 Can we have a potential valuation on UJO now? Double the value of oil is a starter.
4343 2018-03-26 15:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza for lunch today will be: raw crust with stale motor oil and spinach.
4344 2018-03-26 15:11:03 "I forgot" is bad for business and it shows unpreparedness and complacency. These foolish virgins forgot that they will require oil for their lamps to work.

Is just as foolish as a farmer gets to the farm but forgets his hoe.

Anyway, I fear we're getting away from the original post which was the laughable absurdity of that poster and your president

4351 2018-03-26 15:10:06 You should check the engine oil at least once a month and preferably more often. Overfilling the engine oil in your car can cause serious damage to your internal engine parts and eventually lock up your engine.
4352 2018-03-26 15:10:01 Also, I don't completely agree with you but your voice is a part of the message we are sending. The question is how many times do the voters ask for the Vaseline? A tree can make unlimited branches & olive oil may help with chafing for stupid voters.

4356 2018-03-26 15:09:27 “The oil companies knew from 1959 on, they did their own study that there would be global warming happening because of fossil fuels, and on top of it that it would be risky for people’s lives, that it would kill,” Schwarzenegger said Sunday.
4357 2018-03-26 15:09:27 Not sure when it might happen, but it seems like crude #oil could have a violent downward move soon.

4363 2018-03-26 15:08:49 The real problem is the corporatization of america. Guns are part of that. So is oil. And war. As is everything. Big business is the soullessness and I do hope that your generation is the cure. Buy local. Avoid credit. Focus on community. You are hope.
4364 2018-03-26 15:08:46 The railroads will be happy to take up the slack and transportat the same oil to the same refineries at a higher risk of spill with more pollution
4365 2018-03-26 15:08:43 "Former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said Sunday he is going to sue big oil companies for “first degree murder.”

During a live recording of a Politico podcast, Schwarzenegger said he was talking to several private law firms about taking on oil companies in court."
4366 2018-03-26 15:08:35 I was just going to ask about what oils I need to try. The coconut oil isn’t working for me
4367 2018-03-26 15:08:32 Before you start your own thread in someone’s mentions you should do your googles because gum turpentine and turpentine oil are not the same

I feel he can bring d waring parties together instead as a statesman. Haba Baba
4375 2018-03-26 15:08:02 China and India are WAY ahead of Canada investing in renewables at a rate that puts us to shame. We will be pedalling oil and stuck in the last century and they will be far ahead of our Tarsands economy.

4413 2018-03-26 15:02:49 Uh... actually it is NOT 'your' bank. Scotland also has shares in it, as do others. Your 'assets' also believe in part to other 3 nations too. You need to stop thinking eveything belongs to YOU. Otherwise other nations may just decide to keep their own revenue, water, oil etc.
4414 2018-03-26 15:02:39 Anything to avoid our responsibility to stop polluting the atmosphere. Let’s dump random stuff up there so we can burn more dirty oil. Doesn’t save the ruined waterways and communities and the wars associated with oil though. Can’t just dump salt on an oil spill.

4429 2018-03-26 15:01:05 Yes, I do. I’m also a cannabis journalist and specialize in the area of cbd. My advice is to not buy it online. You want to use the oil that’s available in dispensaries or cannabis retail stores. It’s more medicinal & therapeutic bc it has all the components of the plant in in it
4430 2018-03-26 15:01:02 so if Basil, pine nuts & oil is basically a salad and a basil pesto salad, is basically a salad on a salad, then a basil pesto potato salad is a salad on a salad on a salad.?

4446 2018-03-26 14:58:31 I like his 5 pillars, something we can use to give credit to more science based diets. But I dislike that this didnt prevent him from recommending fish, fish oil, "plenty" of olive oil in his diet. Even goat milk, cheese and eggs to 65+ people.

4451 2018-03-26 14:57:46 @royalenfield I had given my bike for 3rd service at Voyage Motors Kandivli East (Mumbai). Got it back on same day and took it to work the day after. Half way through my trip I saw huge fumes coming out due to oil leak from improper packing of oil ring . Pathetic service
4452 2018-03-26 14:57:44 Has anyone tried evening primrose oil ?
4453 2018-03-26 14:57:36 It's also worth noting that, while the American people have been consistently distrustful of Putin, the last 3 US presidents have all started off quite optimistic towards him ('good soul' GWB, 'reset relations' BHO). oil & gas buy a lot of benefit of the doubt

4455 2018-03-26 14:57:14 Dear Mazda, 

Despite your best efforts. I was able to change the oil in my 2018 and didn't have to take it to the dealer. 

Eat a dick,
Brandon 

P.S. I still love my car. You just aggravated me.
4456 2018-03-26 14:57:11 TLB But only five of them were wise enough to fill their lamps with oil, while the other five were foolish and forgot.

To say I forgot, is a clear sign of lack of preparation.

4457 2018-03-26 14:57:06 Great picture. There's some amazing industrial views along Southampton Water. When I lived down that way someone I knew who lived across from Fawley treated the oil refinery at night as her own personal illuminations

4472 2018-03-26 14:55:08 Correct. India is the 2nd most oil importer with more than 50% forex outflow for this import.
4473 2018-03-26 14:55:06 Canada has the third largest oil reserves of any country in the world after Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.
4474 2018-03-26 14:54:53 My understanding from afar is they felt oil and gas was getting loss in the mass of Nalcor. Wanted separate focus and streamlining to unleash that divisions potential more. Everything at Nalcor is hydro and MF. Dominates all.

4479 2018-03-26 14:54:05 Maybe he should have given N. Cruz a hug and shown him some love prior to the tragic crime. Sounds like he was bullied and ostracized since at least 6th grade. Perhaps some kindness on the part of his peers would have led him down a different path.
4480 2018-03-26 14:53:55 If a wheel were good. It wouldn't squeak so why would one waste $1.00 of oil on a 2 bit wheel ?

There's no return for the investment,  and not worth the effort to save a defective wheel. Since   
it costs more in oil than any remaining value it may have had.
4481 2018-03-26 14:53:54 don't worry so much about oil spills. it'll all be diluted by the melting ice caps

4508 2018-03-26 14:51:34 You may be close. Gov. Huckabee refers to the media as “Breaking Wind”.  It is the media that pushes this Russian induced global warming theory on Americans to screw with us and capitalize on oil. Take care of the flakes breaking wind instead of the cows. Problem solved.

4578 2018-03-26 14:43:30 There's a reason Trump lost his hometown by a 9 to 1 margin: New Yorkers knew him best. They knew the cons. They saw the scams. They listened to his bullsh!t. They heard the fake bravado. It was all a farce. 

Only blithering idiots bought what that snake oil salesman was selling
4579 2018-03-26 14:43:28 It would rather depend on what they do on the oil rig.

4588 2018-03-26 14:42:58 I entertained the thought of driving to New York since now that I finally have time to solidify my plans, everything is expensive and inconvenient.

Then I took my car in for an oil change and found out I need more repairs than my car is worth. So many nightmares coming true :(
4589 2018-03-26 14:42:48 A great product for helping with rosacea is our Super Greens Nutrient Boost Serum. The marula oil in it helps to calm redness and skin irritation, while the chlorophyll delivers essential vitamins to the deeper layers of your skin

4599 2018-03-26 14:41:29 No, it’s an oil so you still get the scent. I like to drop them towards the back of the shower where less water hits or I sometimes run it directly on the shower head.
4600 2018-03-26 14:41:10 The entire office reeks of heavy patchulouli oil and I'm going to fucking murder the game designer when he comes in this morning what the actual fuck

4602 2018-03-26 14:41:01 the term "conservative media" is MOSTLY an oxymoron ... this site does actually tout #Conservative ideas quite often .. but most of the "so-called" conservative media do not ... they are making too much money selling snake oil (aka entertainment) and that is their business

4606 2018-03-26 14:40:47 It requires going under the car to drain the oil by unscrewing the 17 mm bolt. There should be "Engine Oil" with an arrow pointing to it

4625 2018-03-26 14:39:17 CIV representative on the panel: One of the main limiters to investments in natural gas is the fact that, relative to oil, there's a limited set of potential end uses. #ACF2018
4626 2018-03-26 14:38:53 Encouraging women to consider science, or any career, and changing attitudes is worthwhile. Change takes time and can't be forced, as some would appear to believe. What next? Female miners, oil workers, road workers, infantry, construction workers, sewer inspectors etc.?

4640 2018-03-26 14:37:30 Oil change to start the day. Then a bit later the interview I've been waiting for!! Let's do this!!
4641 2018-03-26 14:37:25 Asian snake oil was made out if water snakes, and so it was FULL fatty acids, like fish oil. Americans used land snakes, so it had none of those properties. The Asian snake oil was very useful for all sorts of things. It was just corrupted here. So there you go. 
4642 2018-03-26 14:37:10 Anybody who says coconut oil clogs their pores is using waaaay too much, a little goes a long way. Obviously any type of oil you apply in excess is going to clog your pores. Common sense people.
4643 2018-03-26 14:37:10 Not just beaten and choked: she had hot oil poured on her too, apparently.
4644 2018-03-26 14:37:07 Sugar, Palm oil or crude oil refinery?

4650 2018-03-26 14:36:46 We also had home remedies with kerosene and sugar or castor oil. I know what I was eating.

4653 2018-03-26 14:35:54 I see oil wrestling being your gold medal sport
4654 2018-03-26 14:35:53 Between this organic honey and oregano oil.... life is great! 
4655 2018-03-26 14:35:48 Ja, skremmende! "Data is the new oil."
4656 2018-03-26 14:35:45 I want this carrot and avocado oil from namaste organics 
4657 2018-03-26 14:35:45 I’m sorry, but I’m going to “well, actually” snake oil for a moment. Snake oil was brought to the US with Asian (particularly Chinese) immigrants. They used it for all sorts of ailments. American hucksters picked it up and started selling it.
4658 2018-03-26 14:35:41 Tough to do - the further you pull back the chart, the harder the nuance to see. Notably in 2014 stocks kept going up after oil plunged (due to #OPEC). In 2008, they both were crushed. #OOTT

4660 2018-03-26 14:35:29 Paradoxically, despite being a global leader in electric transport, Norway is western Europe's biggest oil producer and is falling behind on its 2015 Paris climate agreement to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030.

4679 2018-03-26 14:34:02 Look at a chart of oil exports from US for past 9 years and you will see this is the result of a steady trend. Nothing to do with Trump.
4680 2018-03-26 14:33:57 .@WellnessMama you say to spit after oil pulling into a trash can... do you think that means we should do the same after brushing our teeth if the toothpaste contains coconut oil?
4681 2018-03-26 14:33:48 So I mixed castor oil and wild growth oil . For hair growth can't wait to see how this hair growth journey going to work.
4682 2018-03-26 14:33:44 Non-event, obviously. How about banning their oil from markets? Also, ban Russia from SWIFT. If Trump does that, I will entertain the no collusion bs. Of course, that will never happen.
4683 2018-03-26 14:33:41 Not yet, but the longer we can hold out, the cheaper the oil will be. It’s sooo expensive when it’s cold weather! 
4684 2018-03-26 14:33:27 ありがとーーーーーーｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗ

4685 2018-03-26 14:33:17 If you’re going to build a career in local politics (and I wish you well), why not commence from a credible fact base? Crude oil exports via the expanded KM are not “on behalf of” KM, they are for KM’s shippers.
4686 2018-03-26 14:32:59 My young friend, the NRA is not an oil lobby protecting independent wealth.  They have power only because of the millions of citizens who support them.

You should try talking to those citizens themselves and understanding their concerns.

4692 2018-03-26 14:32:05 I don’t really have a real recipe.. 3 cup flour. 1/4 cup olive oil.. 2 tsp. Sea salt.. mix with a fork until the oil is mixed in and crumbly.. make a well in the flour and mix in enough hot water to make a soft dough that is easy to handle. Kneed it on a floured surface.
4693 2018-03-26 14:31:52 I mean I didn’t like cry or pass out or anything lol but it definitely ducking hurt but I’m glad I finally got them out. And I got this bio oil so hopefully it doesn’t scar
4694 2018-03-26 14:31:49 That's if it exists.  Just like "oil burning" as a power 'push to pass'
4695 2018-03-26 14:31:47 I love when i go in for an oil change and they come back and tell me everything that’s wrong with my car. Ya i know my car is shit, just change my damn oil.
4696 2018-03-26 14:31:44 Of course, it will be an oil exec. Oklahoma, the state, is so trite and boring with their oil worship. Why wouldn’t OU be same?
4697 2018-03-26 14:31:42 Has anyone tried Golden palm kernel oil
4698 2018-03-26 14:31:38 そういえば、長男夫婦はツイ友で結婚したって言ってた（あまり詮索はしない親なのでｗ
4699 2018-03-26 14:31:31 Exploration costs are still way to high, per the CIV representative on this panel. We saw oil exploration costs fall rapidly after the 2014 crash in oil prices, he says. Why haven't we seen a similar decline in exploration costs for natural gas? #ACF2018
4700 2018-03-26 14:31:29 This has nothing to do with Trump. China wants to have have a rightful say in determining the price of oil since it is the largest importer of oil. It’s also part of China’s long term plan to internationalize Yuan.
4701 2018-03-26 14:31:23 Nigeria is one of the world’s leading oil producers which has a variety of mineral & human resources. Despite this, the country has not been particularly successful in using its resources for the general good & sustainable development. #PressforProgress

4706 2018-03-26 14:30:54 You're mistaken. It would only be important if Siddeque Mateen had fucked Donald Trump in the past.
4707 2018-03-26 14:30:50 Lots of talk about western democracies, in relation to #RussianDiplomats be expelled. Thinking it has more to do with Russia joining #Syria & fucking up their plan to destroy it, all for a pipeline & of course the oil in the Golan Heights, illegally occupied by Israel.
4708 2018-03-26 14:30:46 I'm waiting for an oil change right now and it's very confusing bc there's someone else here named Lee, which is a name I tend to give in waiting rooms cause it's easier to pronounce.
4709 2018-03-26 14:30:44 So... remember when my face was fucked up during Christmas when I got sick?

4723 2018-03-26 14:29:17 Psssst use butter instead of olive oil if you wanna LIVE and have better tasting food at the expense of your arteries

4725 2018-03-26 14:29:09 Hmm... maybe there are different practices within the SG's office. The last one I read was the government brief in Oil States, and I'm fairly sure it had headings. 

I do agree that l omitting headings entirely (as SCOTUS does!) is atrocious.
4726 2018-03-26 14:29:04 Why are you selling our national resources to Saudi Arabia?
Keep out of OUR parks!! If you must drill do it in Alaska and keep foreign countries out. Put our companies and people to work. Sell Them our oil and gas. Jobs, jobs, jobs. Get it?

4728 2018-03-26 14:28:40 I made an appointment they said they will rotate my tires for free during the oil change. I don't know how to check oil so idk how to see if they overfilled it. D:
4729 2018-03-26 14:28:35 Well also because I have super oily skin and people used to make fun of me when I would wear foundation and didn’t know how to control my oil

4732 2018-03-26 14:28:26 Hi Jen! Woohoo, finally received :) Brow powder isn't needed & I suggest not using anything oil based products before or after applying WunderBrow as these will affect the results. I also suggest that you use a toner to remove any excess oils from the skin!

4736 2018-03-26 14:27:58 It is rather unnerving. The fact some are now actually suggesting this group turned the corner after the trade deadline is mind-boggling.

4753 2018-03-26 14:25:50 Does the bud have to be dry to make oil? Also can I use the entire plant to make it? Anyone? I'm a old professional stoner but semi new to dabs, & oil, I want try to make it  @PeaceLoveHerbs @PureDabs @LitDabs @HIGH_TIMES_Mag
4754 2018-03-26 14:25:46 make sure your water is salted and has a bit of olive oil in it. when you strain the pasta after it’s done cooking you have to immediately add more olive oil or a sauce to keep it from sticking.

4761 2018-03-26 14:24:53 Sure but as I said, it could very easily go the other way. Not as simple as some seem to think.
4762 2018-03-26 14:24:46 @narendramodi In hindsight, When oil prices were low, we should have used weak currency to support exports so that farmers get more money for their products and exporters will get more money for the products and  would lead to confidence in the economy to kick start investment
4763 2018-03-26 14:24:31 They are also keenly aware of how much money in his superpac comes from the NRA and Russian oil barons.

4781 2018-03-26 14:22:50 ほんとズルいよな。自分は、私に預けて飲み会はもちろん、落語にプロレスに甲子園。私には「仕事休めないから無理」「預けられるならそうすれば」「娘がかわいそう」「娘連れていって」。行けるのは年末の忘年会くらい。年に一度のイベントにも行けない。会社の飲みも当然断るしかない。ひたすら不満。
4782 2018-03-26 14:22:43 My selfcare is rubbing oil on my body, doing masks, drinking my morning tea, connecting to Gaia, keeping my energy true to Self, reading books, experimenting with plants, listening to good music, spending time with friends
4783 2018-03-26 14:22:42 How about you just take what is SAFE and WORKS? The Holy oil and Extreme oil. The Holy oil kills pain within minutes and both destroy cancer. The truth has been hidden by Big Pharma for 80 years so that they have the only "cure" that lines their pockets while keeping you sick
4784 2018-03-26 14:22:36 Oil bath? :)
4785 2018-03-26 14:22:31 Same can be said for oil companies, big pharma and health insurance

4787 2018-03-26 14:22:21 You should change your oil every 3k and rotate your tires every 5k. Check your stick to make sure they don’t overfill it. I wouldn’t want to mess around with that stuff! >_<

4791 2018-03-26 14:21:46 Did you mean you mean JPMorgan? who are being criticised for funding oil sands projects? We only referenced Bloomberg in a prev tweet in relation to our new 2DS analysis tool to review climate risk in oil companies.
4792 2018-03-26 14:21:24 What about trains hauling oil and gas? Trains will crash too.

オリーブ油は、オリーブの果実から得られる植物油である。
4796 2018-03-26 14:21:17 We have no pure relationship. We are one because of oil and gas. We the southerners especially old eastern region do not believe in one Nigeria. Referendum will prove it soon no matter how the same government of Nigeria is killing and subjugating us. BIAFRA must come!!!
4797 2018-03-26 14:21:13 I get it. You're in the minority at home and in general. You believe the squeaky wheel gets the oil. 
You fail to realize that. When the wheel squeaks.
We trash it and get a new wheel.
4798 2018-03-26 14:21:12 Acne prone skin is stressful. Using anything with a significant amount of oil in it will lead to a breakout. I don't eat anything fried or use hair cream, at all. If I do, I'll see the result on my face the next day.

If Scotland says re-join, we have many resources that come into play. Oil & gas being a big one, same with renewable energy.
Fishing is important to Scotland.
We would safeguard our marine assets.
Like Iceland (90% of the catch).
Deals can be done.

5181 2018-03-26 13:37:15 How to Get an Oil Stain Out of Clothing:

1) panic and frantically scrub with dish soap or stain remover of choice 

2) assume that it’s gone but you can’t tell because it’s wet

3) air dry; collapse into fit of rage at sight of stain

4) throw clothing into open flame of choice

5228 2018-03-26 13:31:56 Jim Willie thinks the $USD won’t collapse but enter into a steady and unstoppable period of decline. The rate of decline will increase as China gains control of the Saudi oil industry. Either way, it looks like moving a big chunk of my 401K to Asian Pacific funds was smart.

5240 2018-03-26 13:30:24 @davidfickling Nice piece on petro-Yuan limits today. IMO, really interesting question is why there's never been a liquid Euro denominated contract for crude, say in Paris? EZ as an importer is up there with CN, it's got oil majors, a global banking system, and fully open K/A.
5241 2018-03-26 13:30:18 Govt's have limited methods to raise dollars; taxes, royalties, selling off assets, shirking when necessary but when all fails they fall back on increasing taxes 100%` of the time. It time to develop our resources oil, minerals and forestry build the pipeline ,

5243 2018-03-26 13:30:03 A friend recently gave us cookies made with cornmeal, olive oil, and rosemary (plus some other stuff I’m sure) that were rolled in powdered sugar after baking, meaning the cookies themselves, while delicious, aren’t terribly sweet.

5264 2018-03-26 13:26:49 honestly, take some hemp oil. If you dont have any, order some. Or else Meditate before you go to bed or do yoga. Or even read. Something that is away from your phone or any screen before bed can help calm a pacing mind. Do you hav nightmares at all?
5265 2018-03-26 13:26:47 My concern about this whole discussion of common sense regulation. The DOE was formed in the 70s for the purpose of eliminating our dependency on foreign oil. DOE 2018 budget is 6.26 B. and the problem still isn’t solved. There is no common sense regulation with Politicos
5266 2018-03-26 13:26:42 Tulsi oil is very pleasant too.

5550 2018-03-26 12:51:40 The start today (March 26, 2018) of oil futures trading in gold-backed Chinese yuan Gold/Oil/Yuan (#GOY) is being widely seen as a Chinese victory in the ongoing financial war for control of the planet Earth, and a threat to the US #Petrodollar and US Hegemony #Deepstate #Endgame

5561 2018-03-26 12:50:20 #China yuan backed Petro-dollar is the best thing to happen for the US dollar. Now China will have to insure that market as well as compete for other oil producers to supply them. Could the YUAN DOLLAR end up making PRC products more expensive? @checovenier @carloalberto

Technically, we've not stopped being univited interventionist.

Not since the advent of oil exploration anyway.

5615 2018-03-26 12:45:02 I'm a big bull on oil for a lot of reasons, but most strategic thing for Iran/Yemen to do is prolong war and attack population. Attacking oil/infrastructure could provoke American/other commitment to join the fight in the name of "stability."

5627 2018-03-26 12:43:55 Look for gold prices to shoot up long term.. China is setting up for the gold for crude transaction indirectly.. Countries will sell oil for yuan and convert yuan to gold in the Shanghai gold exchange.. Similar to how India purchased oil from Iran earlier..

Rocks in the classroom is a fallback plan in case you don't sto them with the boiling oil above the main door, right?
Glocks beat Rocks, hands down.
5685 2018-03-26 12:37:25 Ugggghhh homemade foods means less oil, less chicken and less salt 
5686 2018-03-26 12:37:17 We planned to discontinue ministry of Petroleum & Power, They will be collapsed into Energy Commission of Nigeria (ECN) so that there can be proper integration in our energy industry (both oil & electricity). This will further reduce duplication of duty & the cost of governance.
5687 2018-03-26 12:37:12 How did you extract the oil from the babies?
5688 2018-03-26 12:37:07 like weight loss and other conditions, addxn treatment does attract internet scams and snake oil. The "tough love" stuff is old, in terms of residential treatment. You see more of that in Vivitrol proponents - families, criminal justice. Not love at all.
5689 2018-03-26 12:36:56 Hey! I don’t use dry shampoo, I use powder foundation in my hair instead. It has a brown color and it soaks up oil really well. Also I don’t have a problem with it being itchy. :)

5701 2018-03-26 12:36:06 I've read it. And Jaws. Not sure Melville should be taught, but it's a great book about wailing which is like Sinclair Lewis's Oil!. Not necessarily Universal despite ahab's obsession.
5702 2018-03-26 12:35:58 Well, whatever you smell, something is certainly rotten!  An NEB process that: ignores the testimony of several intervenors, where their testimony contradicts the oil lobby’s testimony; that excludes enviro. concerns;  that excludes locals directly affected -is not a fair process

5704 2018-03-26 12:35:44 orange oil - really. most cats hate the smell of citrus and if they get it on their paws will freak out. it's harmless to them but generally they'll avoid anything with it on it.

5709 2018-03-26 12:35:31 I had a slice of bread with oil, cheese and cucumber, eaten on my way out to a demonstration... Puigdemont was arrested in Germany and we had a large protest.
5710 2018-03-26 12:35:31 Actually North Korea & Iran destroyed ISIS when they stopped purchasing crude oil from terrorists. The tax break was for the upper class only. The unemployment rate has dropped every year since 2001 so it keeps getting lower. The Chum Bucket hasn’t done much
5711 2018-03-26 12:35:27 thank god it wasnt for the salad anywhoooo

she bought wholemeal bread and olive oil so i asked if shes going to make croutons for the salad and she said so i had to simplify the word by saying "the crispy bread in the sayur" and yes she was making em

5727 2018-03-26 12:33:28 too much oil.... fried food... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
5728 2018-03-26 12:33:08 Yes, @routerestaurant, ditching oil based plastic straws could attract more customers in. There’s high public demand for businesses to use alternatives to plastics and many people are opting for restaurants that have made that change.
5729 2018-03-26 12:33:00 Orthodox Muslim: This is not our religion.  We don’t force girls to marry.  She is too young to be with an older man. Blah blah blah.    Truth: A’isha had the “honor” of marrying prophet of Allah when she was not even 9 year old. He was +50.  No hot oil, though!!!

5818 2018-03-26 12:23:50 Another great comparison chart. One question though... who consumes two TABLESPOONS of seed oil in a SINGLE serving of food? And how? 

I don’t think I’ve ever used more than ONE tablespoon to cook any meal in my life - except paella and risotto :)

5824 2018-03-26 12:22:33 Basically that. Eat a low fat (near) veg'n (no red meat) diet full of carbs (mostly wholegrain) then hope to burn through to your fat stores. I was great at it. Olive oil would go rancid in my house because I was so low fat. Always hungry. Did the opposite & near instant health!

Or a floor on the price of gas, subsidize American solar firms, a productivity linked prize? Then, I'd believe they were trying to encourage American innovation.

5997 2018-03-26 11:54:18 BTW, Dipshit, every time you yell "NO COLLUSION" in a tweet, it appears as if there definitely was collusion, you're fully aware of it, you're trying to hide it & you're desperate to convince people to believe otherwise.

Tasted the pesto. It is NASTY.
6001 2018-03-26 11:53:51 We could have had the oil money but that is another debate. Re-entering would mean accepting the Euro. I don't know how many people want that. Leaving entirely would cripple the party that tried it. Logically, staying in the middle would be the best solution IMO.

6011 2018-03-26 11:51:46 It’s simply economics and today’s technology.  The IDIOTS are the ones who protest saying we need to be off oil today without an alternative in place.  Someday it will happen.  Do you use products from oil?  Maybe you should be thankful for the technology today.

6099 2018-03-26 11:39:57 1) It is convertible...under oil contract & via gold. 

2). You're absolutely correct it's nowhere near as deep, but when you're US govt needing $300B/wk in buyers (like this wk), any shift of marginal buyers is suboptimal over time.

6109 2018-03-26 11:37:16 I am supposed to be in keeping myself calm in a non stimulating way... so this afternoon I plan to reorganise my cook books and oil my kitchen benches. The excitement may just finish me off but if it doesn’t I may pop a load of laundry in as well.

6114 2018-03-26 11:36:15 I get really bad insomnia now and again and the only thing that really works for me is lavender oil, like covering your pillows in it. Sounds mad but I swear by it, it's cheap as well

6116 2018-03-26 11:36:01 Rubbish. There are NO proven cases of anyone curing themselves with cannabis oil. There have been studies (as with many other possible treatments) but no real evidence and definitely NO proven cures. Cancer patients need support not this constant fake news

6134 2018-03-26 11:31:52 It is said that her parents threw hot oil on her because she exercised a God-given right to say "NO." God, Himself, gave us FREE-WILL, which is the right to say Yes or No. God frowns on ABJECT CRUELTY, PURE EVIL, OPPRESSION and SLAVERY, especially when it involves children.
6135 2018-03-26 11:31:41 Why are we making fuel from corn, food? I GET OiL.  BAD for our Cars. I don't believe the BS sold to farmers. I saw what junk it leaves in gas tanks!

6137 2018-03-26 11:31:17 For context, all energy producing plant using rotating technology (which is most) uses large quantities of oil which has the potential to leak. It’s not related to the technology but rather how they are maintained.
6138 2018-03-26 11:30:57 It is, kinda... I'll also refer to it as "motor oil coffee." I can thank my previous job in radio for getting me hooked.

Why are you beset with gloom?

Just like moons and like suns,
With the certainty of tides,
Just like hopes springing high,
Still I'll rise."

6143 2018-03-26 11:30:00 In most years the league will be won by the team with the most resources. Unless they find oil below Ashburton Grove (and are willing to spend the revenue) Arsenal will have to do a Leicester to win the league in between clubs with mineral wealth.

6147 2018-03-26 11:29:16 If you can't bring infrastructure (Electricity alone) to an acceptable standard with borrowed funds and oil revenue, you still won't do it when you get more from tax. If I can't trust you with the former, how do you expect me to trust you with the latter?
6148 2018-03-26 11:29:13 Who remembers that time when some African American lady from dashiki wearing coconut oil twitter made a video of herself calling gele The Ghaylay and tried  to pass it off like it was some deep spiritual outfit

6154 2018-03-26 11:27:19 I gotta use a SWEET smelling oil to combat that smell in the morning cos it low-key makes me feel illl looolll
6155 2018-03-26 11:27:08 Perfect morning today: after a great sleep (almost 10h...), I drank a hot lemon juice, went to the gym for a huge work-out, had breakfast, drank my tea outside while reading in the sun, bathed my nails in lemon juice and massage it with castor oil 
6156 2018-03-26 11:27:04 He really sounds like the snake oil salesman that he is
6157 2018-03-26 11:26:34 This reminds me of the recent story about a Christian woman in the South (Arkansas?) who was forced by her parents & church to marry the deacon that raped her. I believe she was raped at age 9 & forced to marry at 12. She didn't resist & get the hot oil -- just yrs of abuse.
6158 2018-03-26 11:26:16 No it’s oil but thank you <3

6161 2018-03-26 11:25:20 Certainly not - it also explains why #Russia has shown an uncharacteristically strong commitment to the #OPEC production cut deal so far. Russia will do better with #oil prices at US$60-70/b, even if that means handing market share to the US. @maxlambertson

6163 2018-03-26 11:25:18 And Reliance has the *ahem* referee. And the best margins on oil refining worldwide.
6164 2018-03-26 11:25:00 Idk you have to wonder if their religion didn't say women were lower species, if they'd react like that.  Doubt they'd throw their son in hot oil and that discrepancy is directly related to their religion!

6187 2018-03-26 11:19:23 Not to mention those abandoned oil wells that are polluting farmers fields created by consecutive conservatives governments. Why was no measure in place for ownership to have to clean up when finished or dry for a clean up.  Hmmm !

6379 2018-03-26 10:46:26 Prove what you say cause that is a pretty serious accusation.  And please don't quote a rebel story. As well rail safety and pipeline safety both suffer when we reduce regulation to increase profit. Regardless of how oil is transported it is dangerous.

6392 2018-03-26 10:44:02 Not making noise cos it seems our point of view is being sidelined. If anyone says Danjuma is corrupt, which dispensation did 2.8 billion Naira oil money go missing? And who performed audits on petroleum trust fund program. Who is auditing Nnpc? Maybe petroleum minister.

6413 2018-03-26 10:39:13 I wouldn't recommend it. Yes it hydrates but it's likely to cause skin reactions such as acne. Warmed olive oil should give the result you're looking for
6414 2018-03-26 10:38:42 Absolutely! All part of the Hydrogen industry. More expensive than oil* but far more secure and stable a supply. The UK is also sitting on some great enabling e.g. SABRE pre-cooler can potentially improve desalinisation efficiency by >10%.

6457 2018-03-26 10:30:15 pretty cold today. and raining (we need the rain) so got the oil heaters out of the garage and put them on to see if they still work. all good. all set for winter..
6458 2018-03-26 10:29:31 them along, and the motion of the pods on the roads eventually cracks them open so more trees can grow. And the trees are sort of holy to the people because of the oil that soaks onto their claws from the seed pods as they're travelling.
6459 2018-03-26 10:29:30 The bars show barrels per day displaced by electric vehicles. The one for 2017 is equivalent to 1.5% of China's total oil demand for that year.

6464 2018-03-26 10:27:47 I think the theory concerning Syria is to do with Iran's political interest in Syria's logistic significance regarding the transport of oil. It has nothing to do with fighting over Syria's own paltry oil wealth.

6471 2018-03-26 10:25:58 Wait until the Barrel of oil goes up then the fracking can start, what about the water they will need to use in Fracking and the UNKNOWN CHEMICALS thethey will not disclose to the PUBLIC.
How about the water contamination .
Do not pour petrol on the fire and ASK THE WATER What !!
6472 2018-03-26 10:25:51 Do you honestly think exporting LNG is a viable, competitive industry? You're looking at a minimum billion $ terminal with 2-300 million $ ships. Who's going to pay for that?

Again, crude ≠ gas. You can't run an oil powered vehicle on gas.
6473 2018-03-26 10:25:20 But even if you take the dirtiest coal sourced electricity supply, EVs still use much less CO2 / pollutants. Oil not only needs a lot to get it out ground and refine it, it has to then be transported in huge diesel trucks daily to petrol stations, past pedestrian lungs

6498 2018-03-26 10:20:36 I'd say the article does more to explain the silence of China & India in the face of atrocities due to econ interests.

6504 2018-03-26 10:19:28 Politicians are only after enriching themselves and their cronies.

Power in Nigeria is hustled for just for that reason and nothing more.

No nationalistic or progressive views, no concrete ideas or plans to make the country better, it's all about oil money.

6942 2018-03-26 08:47:03 if you haven’t thrown it away already you can totally reuse the oil—just for seafood but still. Filter it through a strainer/coffee filter or something into a jar and stash it in your fridge for the next crispy. Save $ grandma style.

6979 2018-03-26 08:39:39 if they don't "need" the oil for domestic use they can shrink the supply and raise the prices. It's to have more control. Currently, they need oil for everything.

7026 2018-03-26 08:31:03 Moscow does currently not have the infrastructure to export large amounts of Siberian oil to other destinations than the EU and by other means than its European pipeline system.
7027 2018-03-26 08:30:58 PS: A large part of the Russian state budget still consists of Euros paid by EU countries for large amounts of daily Russian pipeline oil. This West Siberian crude can be easily replaced with oil from other exporters than Russia.

7495 2018-03-26 06:42:51 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
7496 2018-03-26 06:42:50 I mean, the tech itself—distributed trustless ledger—is cool and that’s reason enough to talk and pontificate about it. But yeah that doesn’t merit a sudden wave of booths selling foolish-investor-boosted snake oil at GDC

7498 2018-03-26 06:42:24 Sorry, no idea why. 9M-MRO, (the 777 that was MH370), was using more fuel on the right than the left, using historical engineering data. Each engine is unique. Some use more fuel or oil than others.

7529 2018-03-26 06:34:17 Yes hot oil is dangerous, I burned myself on the fryers a few times. I also know a man who lost an arm in a factory accident, and have seen and heard of incidents where people got pulled into machines on accident and were torn to shreds. Its more dangerous in the factory.
7530 2018-03-26 06:33:56 Am a big fan of electric vehicles. But Avinor are simply pushing the PR button here. The in-service date they claim for very short haul electric aircraft is 2040.

7545 2018-03-26 06:30:08 Based on what evidence?
You wanted to do this 'logically', we can't just go on gut feelings. People working in fsat food, especially fast fryers, are dealing with some pretty dangerous equipment. (Hot oil can burn very badly very easily.)
7546 2018-03-26 06:29:30 I see on his page that he lists himself as Conservative - Anti-Gay Marriage - Pro-Life, also Anti-Immigrant, & Pro Oil. The only Democratic stance I see is he wants single payer healthcare for all in a Medicare type system. It seems he has run twice before as a Dem as well.

7578 2018-03-26 06:20:43 Gosh, thanks Emil. Thank you for sharing too. You know that Popeye cartoon - he dated Olive Oil, said “I yam what I yam”, ate his spinach and cared for a baby named Sweet Pea. It mattered so much for me to see!
7579 2018-03-26 06:20:34 Yes, Gilles.  Nuclear waste is not really toxic, right? You've been sniffing oil fumes for years, with no sign of brain damage, right?
7580 2018-03-26 06:20:27 First, a fiscal transfer isn't a subsidy. Second, as GERS already allocates a geographic share of oil revenue to Scotland AND all scotch whisky exports are all already allocated to Scotland, may I suggest you look for some truths rather than pathetic memes? Have a lovely day.
7581 2018-03-26 06:20:13 We both know you've never even changed the oil on your car.
7582 2018-03-26 06:20:06 Unfortunately we’re not Norway with its oil and gasses. But I suspect this is where we will end up. Neither in nor out, dragging on for years. Then there’ll be another election which will be fought on leaving totally, re-entering, making the most of where we are.

7769 2018-03-26 05:42:24 @realDonaldTrump I realize that PTSD can be emotional, yet it is also caused by Military burning their military refuse stuff.  and Oil Fields burning in Desert Storm. and Agent Orange Vietnam! I bet that Medicinal MJ would help some! Or even Hemp oil (CBD) 4 Pain/RelaxStress..

7790 2018-03-26 05:37:54 If it makes you feel better, there's no such thing as a mid-Atlantic oil rig; it's kind of a geologic contradiction in terms.

There will be oil rigs though. I'm sorry. But at least they'll merely be peri-Atlantic at best

7822 2018-03-26 05:32:18 Oil isn't a necessity?  Really?  How do you fire trucks get to fires/collision scenes?  How does food get to grocery stores? What fuel do planes use? All of these things (and so many more) are dependent on oil/petrochemical products. Oil will be replaced, but not for 20-30 yrs.
7823 2018-03-26 05:32:11 Buha....Yes he was oil minister without owing a filling station, Head of state with no oil fields, PTF Chair with no foreign account or asset. A democrat who ran 4times for President, won and tolerated all so much dt his admirers want back GMB instead of PMB.

7845 2018-03-26 05:28:34 I am of the belief that USA will export EVEN MORE OIL to China as a result of the #TradeWar on the metals front. What possibly else could China want? They vacuum the planet for raw materials in order to export finished products. #OOTT #NewsAndViews

7847 2018-03-26 05:27:47 The USD is on a path to being worthless. Not backed by anything (except diminishing control over oil), continual printing of USD, countries creating mutual trade agreements away from the USD. New tech will remove it as a system of control. Shitcoin on path to collapse.

7901 2018-03-26 05:14:28 Most of our imports are industries that don't exist here anymore (cars), if they ever did (computers). Our exports OTOH tend to be raw materials that need processing such as ores and oil, followed by foodstuffs. Manufacturing died off during the 80s-90s mostly.

In fact, US has to produce oil now because US cant steal/control it anymore.

8058 2018-03-26 04:40:05 That’s what you get for believing so-called hack “analysts” such as @GasBuddy who are just as much in collusion with big oil and use a variety of completely illogical excuses.
8059 2018-03-26 04:39:58 We must ensure real Canadians understand how much oil come into the east coast of our country from other countries.  Due to equalization Quebecers would benefit from AB oil

8061 2018-03-26 04:39:15 I was trying to buy some cbc oil thru my friends mom. Well I thought it said I had to sing up to buy something well she messaged me and welcomed me to her team I so didn’t mean to do that lol

8069 2018-03-26 04:38:07 So she’s admitting collusion with oil companies who are artificially inflating prices as retaliation for protests? Surely that’s illegal on many levels, right @GasBuddyGuy ?
8070 2018-03-26 04:38:05 Not me. Oil were up 3-1 in 3rd. Lost that lead.  Lost OT faceoff. Don’t like it, protect the 2 goal lead.

8074 2018-03-26 04:37:37 Habs? No, I don’t think I’d be willing to give up on Julien yet. This was a hard season to evaluate him with so many man games missed to inj and bad moves by GM. Hard to be competitive with 11 million unused salary and 10 new starters on a team. But For the Oil. Yes Trotz 4 sure!

8078 2018-03-26 04:37:11 Nobody is saying stop using oil now, or even stop oil production now. There obviously has to be a phase out. We also know, because science clearly shows, that #climatechange means we cannot afford the burn even know oil reserves. Exploration for more is suicidal madness. #endoil

8145 2018-03-26 04:24:28 Ms. Harmer, 3 NOT 12 barrels of fresh water was needed in 2016 to produce one barrel of oil from the oil sands. In-situ facilities use less than 0.3 barrels fresh water per barrel of oil produced. Industry is working hard to continuously improve its environmental record.

There’s no reverse, no parachute, and no brakes... sometimes the key is to unbuckle your seat belt #wisdm

8203 2018-03-26 04:14:33 We just had 900 pipeline guys in town for 6 months. The company they work for fired anyone who got out of line or disrespected the town. Have to say great bunch of guys for the most part . They never support anything oil 
8204 2018-03-26 04:14:02 What kinda oil is this?
8205 2018-03-26 04:14:00 HARDFAX: MEDIUM OIL USING AGGRESSIVE BIG LEAGUE CHEW TO CONTROL 'MYSTERIOUS MERCENARY MX EN'!!!
8206 2018-03-26 04:13:51 Am I the only one yang baru tau yang 'sunscreen needs to be washed with oil cleanser' is a myth? 
8207 2018-03-26 04:13:30 That's just a red herring. Tankers are going to be moving through Salish Sea regardless. They'll carry CDN oil to markets or Alaska Oil to WA state. Either way, the traffic will continue. With one we enjoy the benefit & the risk. The other only the risk, which we won't control.
8208 2018-03-26 04:13:26 Farmers, seniors, natives, whites, veterans, oil workers, gun owners. I’d say that’s a hell of a voting block! The liberals have alienated themselves from civil society with their bullying & arrogance.
8209 2018-03-26 04:13:25 The U.S. is about to start a war on my face bc of how much oil I have

8211 2018-03-26 04:13:17 Judas Iscariot said, "why was this oil not sold for 300 days' wages & given to the poor?" Not b'se he cared about the poor, he was a thief & held the money bag & used to steal the contributions. Jesus said; leave her, you always have the poor with you but you don't always have me

8213 2018-03-26 04:13:13 Guyssss I shaved my entire body and then exfoliated with a coffee body scrub and then moisturized afterwards with a coconut milk body oil and....... y'all don't even knowwwww
8214 2018-03-26 04:13:08 If you haven't tried it with coconut oil, I highly recommend it.
8215 2018-03-26 04:13:06 Oil of God In Your Life is Very Important But His Character Could Keep You and The Oil Flowing For Many Years.
Consider and Keep Working On Your Character Daily.

8217 2018-03-26 04:13:01 Replace every time he says “I am an oil man!” With “I am a gay man!” And it’s the same movie
8218 2018-03-26 04:13:01 Oil is used to make plastic. Credit cards are made of plastic, so you need oil to shop! How about that? #ClimateChange #GlobalWarming
8219 2018-03-26 04:12:46 Men too. I hate a man with some rough ass feet. Either go get a pedicure or soak your toes in some warm water with peppermint oil, clip them toenails. Pleeeeeeease. I do not need a mf scratching up my sheets with his rough ass feet.
8220 2018-03-26 04:12:21 True. Class acts like Lucic on Oil really make Ducks look greasy ;)
8221 2018-03-26 04:12:13 We don’t need sheriffs like that at all that’s why we have such a fucking problem
8222 2018-03-26 04:11:35 Earth is the dumbest planet in the galaxy when they have discovered clean and renewable energy sources, but remain on oil and gas because they believe it has more economic value while the water, land, sea and air  gets contaminated, the very things lif and their lives depend on.
8223 2018-03-26 04:11:32 Still the same old oil.....
8224 2018-03-26 04:11:29 Because he does like oil lol in Alberta we should keep all revenue to our province. See how long it takes him to support us without the income

8227 2018-03-26 04:11:14 Sure if the oil companies have anything to do with it we'll be funding "research" trips to be drilling for oil on Mars before they back alternative or renewable energy.  IDIOTS.
8228 2018-03-26 04:11:06 That’s nice but why caNt my DYING husband still not access CBD oil and other options that are continuously talked about. Research will not prevent his brain giving in. Please put in money to help carers, there is no support for us.

8249 2018-03-26 04:09:00 “Everyone” is not talking about this book. As the president of the USA, it’s not your job to promote books or tv shows. But you wouldn’t know that because you’re a film flam, snake oil salesman, reality TV personality.
8250 2018-03-26 04:08:53 orange jerseys. Oilers gonna oil.
8251 2018-03-26 04:08:42 Say Peter Puck moved the Oil 20 years ago. Would #yeg happy with Calgary or Vancouver capitalizing on our loss?
8252 2018-03-26 04:08:35 Man did Anaheim paly that OT perfectly...keep away while 97 is on the ice and bury your chance when it comed...give the Ducks credit.
8253 2018-03-26 04:07:51 oh you still have to use oil? Ok
8254 2018-03-26 04:07:47 Canada feeds it’s citizens oil
8255 2018-03-26 04:07:46 How do I get stopped by the ops, get threatened on how oil is a felony. And they proceed to take EVWRYTHING but my oil. Lmao bye bored boys
8256 2018-03-26 04:07:03 Oooh be careful with that! Tea tree oil is poisonous for cats and dogs with long exposure like diffusing it into the air and stuff like that
8257 2018-03-26 04:06:56 they lowkey taste different depending on where u get them from and what got fried in the oil before it

Must be worth keeping covered by handing America to other rulers?
8260 2018-03-26 04:06:21 I think tying this to #crypto is a stretch, but it does signal: a) rise of Asia dominance, weaken USD b) oil prices rise with new currency flowing in c) gold rises. I hope this comes along with people buying bitcoin n such, but this sounds a little fomo-y. Which i like!

8262 2018-03-26 04:06:06 Short answer is this is why Putin didn't want a Dem in the White House & why he backed Trump, to get the oil prices back up. Russia's one of the biggest net exporters, economy very dependent on higher oil prices. Also China & India demand are on a long, slow upward trajectory.
8263 2018-03-26 04:05:54 I need my oil changed and I need to clean my air filter

8270 2018-03-26 04:04:44 I made fish fry last night.  It turned out just perfect. 3 mins on each side when pan frying it.  Enough peanut oil to cover half.  3/4 way to high for heat.
8271 2018-03-26 04:04:42 Use some oil! When I used to straighten my hair, I would use Moroccan oil. The heat would not damage my hair.

8286 2018-03-26 04:01:38 PETROYUAN FUTURES released today and volume is looking heavy. End of the Petrodollar? This signals a rise in power from China. Oil is front in center in “world dominance”. Many oil companies use other currencies in a once $USD driven business. This is a serious play. #Petroyuan
8287 2018-03-26 04:01:25 This just in: graham DOES NOT like the smell of tea tree oil

8289 2018-03-26 04:01:10 just earlier I accidentally got tea tree oil near my eye, that’s just not good for business
8290 2018-03-26 04:01:09 Obama and the lefties unleashed the monster (islam) to take the world with the help of oil money from Saudis and Iran.

8292 2018-03-26 04:01:01 Yes, evidence has led back to Bush senior & when he started his Oil Co. in the 50's. And while this seems like a long time ago, they were tied to folks that go back to the turn of the Century, which goes back even further. These "power players" last about 60 years from what I .
8293 2018-03-26 04:00:53 Yeah I would avoid that like the plague too if I had a lot of extra virgin olive oil, from its looks.
8294 2018-03-26 04:00:53 Just bought maria elena punya face oil and hair growth punya oil
Ada sapa pernah pakai?
8295 2018-03-26 04:00:48 Hahaha! You are aware that this diluted bitumen coming out of the Alta Tar Sands is unrefined right? And that BC uses light oil? And so this twin pipeline is to take the dil bit to tankers to go to ASIA? And that dil bit sinks. Its a major catastrophe for our coast. #StopKM
8296 2018-03-26 04:00:46 drinking a ton of oil. it weighs a ton. a ton as in 1 ton. weight wise.

8301 2018-03-26 03:59:17 No, it is best to avoid margarine, which is a synthetic material full of trans fats. Butter and coconut oil are good for the heart, but in moderation
8302 2018-03-26 03:58:40 Never upset about a Picaresque sneak-attack in the carryover play queues via “The Mariner’s Revenge Song” when I’m burning the midnight oil. 
8303 2018-03-26 03:58:40 Did you smear your hands in oil and wave them around in the air again? Only way you'd have got me to watch - and I still wouldn't have cared.
8304 2018-03-26 03:58:37 At the time- gabapentin. If they were still alive, I would give them that and in addition CBD oil, which I now give to other my dogs and other dogs in my care, depending on the condition.

8311 2018-03-26 03:57:20 You realize the dil bit isnt light oil and was going to be put into a tanker for Asia... Of course you do. Either way its travelling. The light oil floats. Dil bit sinks. Which do you want to clean up?
8312 2018-03-26 03:57:12 INTENSE SPIRITUAL WARFARE!! BEWAAAAARE!

But I'm sure the coconut oil should do it. Or mayo.
8313 2018-03-26 03:57:11 visceral food memories on pinoy kids remember:
- the call of the taho man from down the street
- burning yourself when the hot oil from the fried mani would soak through the paper bag
- licking the sauce off your fingers after finishing off your fishballs/squidballs
8314 2018-03-26 03:56:45 what smells better than coconut oil? 
nothing
8315 2018-03-26 03:56:18 Seems the graph tracks the oil price caused by Saudi Arabia dropping the price of oil -- Conservatives saying Trudeau had an agreement  with Saudi Arabia to drop the price of oil??

8317 2018-03-26 03:56:07 well first the earth cooled! then the dinosaurs came, but they all got too big and fat and turned to oil
8318 2018-03-26 03:56:02 Cat food is made of cats. Baby oil is made of babies. Toothpaste is made of teeth.

One of those three sounds more likely to me than the others. And it disturbs me, massively.

8320 2018-03-26 03:55:52 I have no objection to @Oil_Guns_Merica's Avitar. Some people have to use cartoons as avis, because theyre too ugly to use their real picture.
8321 2018-03-26 03:55:51 I don't know why, but having the Oil lose to the Ducks is the worst.  I'd rather load to any other team.
8322 2018-03-26 03:55:40 Ehehe butter or spritzing it with grease/oil can make the skin sizzle and crisp
8323 2018-03-26 03:55:32 The guys having the time of his life out there.  Looks so happy to stick around with the oil.
8324 2018-03-26 03:55:31  you just do it after you wash your hair to seal in moisture. So like a leave-in condition, an oil (coconut/castor) and a creme like curling cream
8325 2018-03-26 03:55:25 ไม่เคยนับ 5555
8326 2018-03-26 03:55:19 Who is suffering? Oil is at record high production levels.

Basically the entire argument you're all making is: I don't care if it's killing the planet everyone else is doing it.
8327 2018-03-26 03:55:01 REAL and it sizzles more often like
i've never had the oil pop on me before making burgers
literally never
why did this happen
8328 2018-03-26 03:55:01 Beard oil is huge! Use it. The goal is to not let your skin/beard dry out. Too many hair/skin products do more damage than good.
8329 2018-03-26 03:54:48 PIGB: Oil marketers, MAN, others oppose single regulator
8330 2018-03-26 03:54:34 No one is saying never use oil. No one is saying never have a gun. They are saying oil spills are far far FAR out of control, greed is the issue and children should not die in school. I’m sure it can be worked out if we tried hard enough.

8336 2018-03-26 03:53:41 It was such a fiaco Russia & Putin regime totally disavow.  Wagner didn't have ground intell & thought it was abandoned oil field.  But you credit Trump: any knowledge of who actually kicked ass? "US-led coalition" is not US.
8337 2018-03-26 03:53:25 We own the oil in the ground. Once it leaves the ground it belongs to private industry.

8339 2018-03-26 03:53:14 Oil is the incentive, the aim is to serve Satan.
8340 2018-03-26 03:53:02 And the oil industry is in Wellington
8341 2018-03-26 03:52:46 A beauty Ethan ! Congratulations NHL #1 in a great game by the Oil

8345 2018-03-26 03:51:59 Life is a lot harder when you can’t make that phone call and talk about life for hours. And I have to to change my own oil....
8346 2018-03-26 03:51:55 Why did you bomb, shoot & kill so many kids & families? Guess that imperial oil & poppy money was too good to pass up!
8347 2018-03-26 03:51:39 I bought an essential oil diffuser and I’m in love with it
8348 2018-03-26 03:51:35 LOVE IS OIL
8349 2018-03-26 03:51:25 tanning oil is one of the best things I own

8351 2018-03-26 03:51:13 Loyal to the oil.
8352 2018-03-26 03:50:53 Impressive pass from Mcdavid gets through to Bear who puts it past Gibson on the power play, 4-3 Oil
#ANAvsEDM
8353 2018-03-26 03:50:45 The Oil didn’t have a SINGLE defenceman who could see that lane before Bear. Awesome offensive instincts.
8354 2018-03-26 03:50:33 Grandpa use to tell me:
 "don't oil the swing if you like to listen to it squeak".
Looking back I think Grandma must have wanted her swing oiled.
8355 2018-03-26 03:50:33 I'm so chilled hey when it comes to hair care. I wash, once every two weeks, but mainly I dampen my hair with water in the evening , massage with coconut oil then plait them before I go to bed. Ndithwale nge qhiya e silky, so the oil doesn't get absorbed by the pillow.
8356 2018-03-26 03:50:29 Jesus Christ : He has sent me (Isaiah 61:1)

Thankyou God for Sending Jesus to give me an ornament of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of joy instead of mourning, the garment [expressive] of praise instead of a heavy, burdened, and failing spirit
Thankyou Jesus
8357 2018-03-26 03:50:25 If Jesus walked on water, does that mean Lucifer walked on oil ??
8358 2018-03-26 03:50:19 The conversation here is whether the Kansas budget shortfalls were to be blamed on tax cuts or plummeting ag and oil commodity prices.

A majority of states, controlled by both parties alike, have had budget shortfalls in recent years. Commodity prices are a leading cause.
8359 2018-03-26 03:50:17 There’s an oil for every incense and herb.
8360 2018-03-26 03:50:11 #threegoodthings 1) didn't work on documentation today b/c I deserve a weekend just like everyone else 2) tried coconut oil in my coffee & it was good 3) dried tart cherries & toasted almonds
8361 2018-03-26 03:50:09 Oil flooded the market when Iran and Saudi Arabia pushed the market hard. Their cost for production is $12 and we sit at $23 on the lower side. Shell projects were axed and even the largest Gulf Coast previously 50% owned by them is now owned by Aramco. Can't sell without profit
8362 2018-03-26 03:50:01 Oil filters can be extremely hot, very slippery and swell over time making them difficult to remove by hand
8363 2018-03-26 03:49:55 my goodness..what a pass and the finish from Bear wasn't too shabby either ;)
8364 2018-03-26 03:49:38 Thanks. I’ll try to head to @BikeBikeYYC tomorrow. The Shimano 8 igh on the MEC Hold Steady only shifted reliably down to about -20° so I’m wondering about the 11 which uses oil instead of grease.
8365 2018-03-26 03:49:26 Frying oil splash.
8366 2018-03-26 03:49:18 I think I'm gonna try that too! I've just been sauteeing them in olive oil, garlic and vegan butter and they turn out great but id love to try new sauces!!

8370 2018-03-26 03:48:33 Trump need to open the oil wells off the Louisiana coast the one that was spelling millions of Barrels of oil everyday . Tell the opec to F off and     dedicate to the deficit and it would be paid off in 8 years
8371 2018-03-26 03:48:29 Mash up some dandelions and diffuse with agave. Then drop 4 drops of cilantro oil on your left calf.
8372 2018-03-26 03:48:26 He's a snake oil salesman, and you bought his inventory.
8373 2018-03-26 03:48:22 Muka oily memang sesuai gila pakai sbb dia oil free & lembut gila apply dekat muka. Dia takkan buat muka kte yg oily bertambah oily tp dia bantu moisturised kulit kte gila2. Mmg best!!
8374 2018-03-26 03:48:11 San Juan is in the list of the cities with highest crimes & she careless. Municipal police keep quitting because of lack of payment, mistreatment & lack of equipment. The other day in the news we found out a 100 cop cars are out of service because there's no money for oil change.

8377 2018-03-26 03:47:44 I biarkan je hilang sendiri, usually memang susah nak treat. Or I took prevention steps, like avoid heavyweight products or facial oil during time of the month bc my hormonal acnes will surely arise during that time.

8380 2018-03-26 03:47:18 Our garbage can got some kind of oil / rosin on it from the truck gripper arm. So after I took it out I washed my hands with pine sol to get the rosin off. But now I can’t get the pine sol off my hands to chop vegetables for soup. What gets pine sol off? Pine tar? Gasoline? Lime?
8381 2018-03-26 03:47:02 From benefiting from the development of our resources. And yes we do own the resources. Alberta owns the oil in the oil sands. The companies pay a royalty for each barrel they produce.

8385 2018-03-26 03:46:41 Data maybe the new oil right now it's the hot potato that will see the Aadhar Swag go missing from authorities
8386 2018-03-26 03:46:39 It's oil, it's wheat, it's soil, it's meat, it's beef!
8387 2018-03-26 03:46:23 Watch the #USD value closely over the next few days and weeks as China opens their crude #oil #futurescontract denominated in yuan tomorrow. This is a move to devalue the US Dollar as the world's reserve #currency and switch from Treasuries/Petrodollar to Gold.
8388 2018-03-26 03:46:22 Rosa T really helps to reduce the oil on my skin. Scars take longer period to tone down but at least it works. The best serum so far!
8389 2018-03-26 03:46:22 It’s an essential oil. I got mine at sunspot!
8390 2018-03-26 03:46:18 Oil On  
8391 2018-03-26 03:46:10 In all honesty, there isn't a day that goes by that it doesn't cross my mind
8392 2018-03-26 03:45:38 9:15 And gavest them saviours, who saved them out of the gate: and the oil that is not in time of harvest until water dropped upon them.
8393 2018-03-26 03:45:35 coconut oil 
8394 2018-03-26 03:45:23 Ideals our politicians follow are petty parody of greed for money & power. Nothing much, nothing less. Evident they are feeding on ignorance of uneducated & poor. Snake oil sellers don't last, but we've got lots. Nepal needs #education to rid of this pests & #soonWewill together
8395 2018-03-26 03:45:20 We learn something every if we just open our eyes and slow down. Being disabled and retired, my day  begins with a few days of oil, a few days of CBDs and a couple of joints. Then I go out to view the world, or go fishing, either way the world still has beauty in it.
8396 2018-03-26 03:45:14 It's in the TJ cheese section, the braided cheese with the red pepper flakes and some sort of oil
8397 2018-03-26 03:45:10 We rely on the oil companies more than we think.  Their fuel helps plant, harvest and bring our food to market.  Every time you purchase anything at all, it was made and brought there by fuel. Every time you fly somewhere, the planes don’t fly themselves. Etc etc etc.......
8398 2018-03-26 03:45:06 Just think of that?

8402 2018-03-26 03:44:34 Two Tribes in History were Anointed with Oil, so, who Anointed Israel as a Nation?

8407 2018-03-26 03:43:30 1) I know enough of them personally that I can fairly say it's willful ignorance of the facts, or pure NIMBYism. There is no valid argument against the expansion when oil will continue to flow to the consumers who demand it. You want fewer tanker? This pipeline delivers.

8451 2018-03-26 03:37:51 Y'all I thought I was getting more freckles on my chest/collar bones and then I realized they were actually just tiny oil burns from work today so
8452 2018-03-26 03:37:46 China just began oil futures priced in yuan (or RMB, never sure which is correct) and that begins #petroyuan to compete with the #petrodollar.

8484 2018-03-26 03:33:01 I don’t believe that in the least! My health has improved dramatically by using organic coconut oil. Proof positive that their guidance is wrong...or at least for me.
8485 2018-03-26 03:32:56 Infusing #cannabis with coconut oil is the healthiest.

I need good dreams.
8487 2018-03-26 03:32:37 Gun co's and Oil co's have ideologically been running from moral bankruptcy for some time. The financial aspects that are catching up to them, are causing them to roll in these crocodile death spirals. Similarly, our Military continues to see deescalation of war as profit loss.
8488 2018-03-26 03:32:34 They deserved this. 
8489 2018-03-26 03:32:25 A man who chose big oil and industry over the people who elected him. Just like the Republicans today who are crippling the state from the legislature and governor’s office.

8498 2018-03-26 03:31:01 If you want to disagree with @Oil_Guns_Merica tweets then make your case, but don't try to pretend that he doesn't look good. I've lived the typical high school girl life, I know jealously when I see it.

 Funny tho cause when oil was 150 a barrel 4 years ago it was $1 a liter. Now its like $60 a barrel and prices at pumps are the same... They are making so much profit now.
8506 2018-03-26 03:30:14 Hey Oil Fan's. Can you imagine a whole season (next season) played like the last 2 weeks or months?

8515 2018-03-26 03:29:06 question for you, is the oil supposed to bring your break-outs to the surface? everytime I use it my acne comes to the surface. I’m not sure if that’s supposed to happen??

8526 2018-03-26 03:27:18 Stopping Canada from what? We don't own the oil and massive amounts are already being exported.
8527 2018-03-26 03:27:00 OMG OMG OMG

8531 2018-03-26 03:26:02 I like hangover it’s so good. Right now I’m using smashbox primerizer which is my fav. I use the primer oil under my eyes and on my nose. It’s working great but I need some pore filler on my cheeks
8532 2018-03-26 03:25:35 Is that a threat Kelly? Social media is not the right place to be making threats nowadays. Second, don’t assume that the money or the oil was ever staying in Canada. That argument is a dead end. That much is clear already.
8533 2018-03-26 03:25:20 He finally blocked me  and I returned him the favor by blocking him back. 
Nothing lost with somebody so pathetic. Separatists and reasoning it's like water and oil.

8536 2018-03-26 03:25:00 False alarm. It is just an oil drilling platform being moved from Mauritius to NW Australia. Nothing to do with #MH370 as far as I can tell.

8545 2018-03-26 03:22:54 I may be wrong on the oil amt. I’m making it Wednesday
8546 2018-03-26 03:22:45 I could not agree more.... if you're gonna be Eye Candy, then tan up, oil up, where tight short and rock it
8547 2018-03-26 03:22:34 So, the Oil is up 3-1 going into the 3rd.  If this stays, then @GoldenKnights are officially in the playoffs and I couldn't be happier!  #VegasBorn
8548 2018-03-26 03:22:32 Got the follow-up and I appreciate the nice sentiment. Both. Oil have been a lot better, though with no pressure. No urgency from Ducks.

8554 2018-03-26 03:21:06 Most Nigerian responders to this tweet are emotionally prompted. The fact holds, you can’t step out of those comparative figures presented in the graph. 
Just saying a significant boost in oil production is not a ready made answer for economic stability. And I agree ...
8555 2018-03-26 03:21:06 OK Try again Let me guess your daddy's job is not subject to outsourcing? You think that the  OPEC oil cartel is an example of "Free Trade"? You think that the  Chinese government forcing tech transfer in order for American companies  to do business there is "Free Trade"?
8556 2018-03-26 03:21:05 Ok so I only wanted to exfoliate my dead skin so I only used the coffee grounds but if you want to like moisturize also I've read that you can mix coconut oil and coffee grounds together?? But that wouldn't rlly work for my skin so like I guess it depends what you're looking for
8557 2018-03-26 03:20:51 At Ducks/Oil, and realizing yet once again that I cannot cheer for the home team in this building under any circumstances
8558 2018-03-26 03:20:42 Was it Canola or Olive oil?
8559 2018-03-26 03:20:25 You mean you need more suffering, bombs in Yemen and Libya, more lies about oil drilling, breaking every campaign promise. Yeah, you miss that do you?

8561 2018-03-26 03:20:03 Just saying people are going to buy the stuff whether it is good for the planet or not. Trying to limit supply didn't work for alcohol or drugs which are discretionary. Oil and it's products are not discretionary for the vast majority

8565 2018-03-26 03:19:33 Also US citizens don’t control the world’s heroin supply or as many untapped oil deposits
8566 2018-03-26 03:19:28 There is a VAST difference between oil and sewage.  MASSIVE.  This cartoon WREAKS of ignorance.  Still, as a Quebec I recognize that Canada runs on oil and there are far more methods of transporting oil that cause a larger risk to the environment.
8567 2018-03-26 03:19:27 Anyone else notice POS Perry pushed Drake’s head forward so the puck would hit him in the head.  And Getzlaugh crying to the refs but still has time to jab Slepy while he’s defenceless on the ground. What a team...
8568 2018-03-26 03:19:27 Why put it on @cnn?  Nobody watches that network, unless they are stuck at the airport or getting their oil changed.

8575 2018-03-26 03:17:49 It's maddening the way wealthyDONOR oil companies are destoying 'Public Lands' & Coastal Waters. We have enough oil for US. These extra barrels are being sold to China. (also reinstateTX & contract for pristine Alaskan Refuge oil drilling-a 'rider' on the 2017 tax reform bill)

8581 2018-03-26 03:16:33 Darn, my 19-year old LaserJet is making "that noise" again while idling. That means I have to open it up with a phillips screwdriver and squirt sewing machine oil into a fan bearing. Wouldn't it be nice if they still made printers like that?
8582 2018-03-26 03:16:24 Today I got out in nature to fly my new drone, fixed an oil leak in my car, fixed my brothers car, discovered I need 2 new power window regulators (), and bought new speakers for my car. Good use of my only day off
8583 2018-03-26 03:16:23 I spent my weekend replacing turbos and after coolers while covered in oil and grease from head to toe in the hot sun. Marine diesel mechanics are no joke

8586 2018-03-26 03:15:48 I wore this precious perfume,
this oil of spikenard,
the night he left me for another. 
My Lord,
as I bathe your feet
with the tears I weep for him
and anoint your feet
with this priceless oil
perhaps you could love me
in the way he never did.
8587 2018-03-26 03:15:44 I have sensitive skin too, I did come up in a rash after my wax and it didn't go away for a few days, and had some blood spotting here and there which stopped after the first day. Coconut oil helped!

Gov’t should regulate like in Europe. It’s all excuses; refineries, short supplies etc. What bunch of crap and record profits.
8592 2018-03-26 03:14:22 Girl yes ! Coconut oil and that spray are heaven
8593 2018-03-26 03:14:21 Enjoy drinking your oil when water is no longer safe. Enjoy eating laboratory grown food when soil is no longer fertile. And enjoy explaining to your kids and grandkids how you did nothing to help.  They will be incredibly embarrassed and upset.
8594 2018-03-26 03:12:52 My man taught me how to change his trucks oil  Then that night, we drove out to a field and sat in the bed of the truck watching lightening and counting starts. #georgialife

8601 2018-03-26 03:11:56 I wish it worked like that. Petroleum liquids accounts for about 33% of total global energy consumption and is still growing. Annual global oil consumed is about 35 billion bbls. If Canada doesn't produce it, Russia, Saudis etal and the US more than happy to ramp up
8602 2018-03-26 03:11:53 I use mine to measure the temperature of the oil when I fry chicken wings. That way it can be re-send and not scorched

8610 2018-03-26 03:11:20 Sir,  please advise ECoR for horizontal development and not just pour oil on oily heads. If we still do same way as it was in Congress regime then what's the point of posing different? I am raising voice for my own BALANGIR. We are deprived & oppressed.
8611 2018-03-26 03:11:17 I am well aware of the events of WWII, Hitler was a failed artist that wanted to rule the world, get control of the oil, exterminate Jews & anyone who would sympathize as well as create the perfect model of what a human should be. Sound familiar?

He may have joked about the THC oil, but wow. The times we live in.
8625 2018-03-26 03:09:55 no bc oil panic hella nerfed and mario's fireballs are booty
8626 2018-03-26 03:09:46 Videos of the Saudis intercepting those ballistic missiles... Oil money and American defense system at work.
8627 2018-03-26 03:09:33 He's not a liberal, actually.
8628 2018-03-26 03:09:29 In short: a Soviet backed Egypt invaded Yemen, threatening Saudi oil fields and Britain's ability to project force in that region. So they sent in privately paid ex-SAS dudes to fight the Egyptians, fostering relationships that led to decades of military arms and training deals.

8633 2018-03-26 03:08:54 @IsThisAB0t @KennyFarq LOL. Nicola Sturgeon FM/SNP mitigating tory austerity.Who duped Scots during indyref with  there's  no oil
8634 2018-03-26 03:08:45 Seize the money from the narco Venezuelan dictatorship and use it to fund the wall. Also liberate the Venezuelan people like U promised. Plus we could make a major oil deal w/ the country w/ the largest proven oil reserves in the world. Also lots of gold & other resources there.
8635 2018-03-26 03:08:28 okay but are you gonna tell me that covering your opponents in hot oil wasn't the gameplan?

8639 2018-03-26 03:07:47 Defectiveness hasn’t worn off. Opposition continues to steadily mount and over 12 legal cases are outstanding. They may get the pipeline built. But whether the oil flows and or continues to flow is a whole other thing. Direct action via front lines is only one method being used.

8644 2018-03-26 03:06:56 What I would give for some shady Norwegians getting in the mix? Imagine what good they could do if they decided to through that SWF oil money around for western liberal values.

8674 2018-03-26 03:02:52 It's vital even oily skin gets moisture because, without it, the skin will overcompensate for the loss of hydration (with more oil), leading to breakouts and an uneven skin texture. Take note: Moisturizing adds water to the skin, not oil.

8682 2018-03-26 03:01:52 well I can't read your mind. Coulda been the "MANY nations that use their oil wealth to try to industrialize through socialism" which were referenced in the tweet you were responding to. 

Use your words. It's not that hard.

8697 2018-03-26 03:00:02 So the natural demand for crypto exists in the open and is huge and even bigger than oil and gaz as it can substitute to entire whole industries while oil and gas are completely dependent on other industries activities. That’s where I see a difference between the two sectors

8711 2018-03-26 02:58:15 Crypto in reality acts as the substainable energy industries. It substitutes to oil and gaz. Crypto is the same it’s natural demand is the current financial services one. The issue where I agree is that token has to be brought household so they see crypto as a service provider

8726 2018-03-26 02:55:49 ว่าง????
8727 2018-03-26 02:55:45 Yeah, and as if we're so clever and every oil producer isn't thinking the same thing... which is why it doesn't work, and will never work.
8728 2018-03-26 02:55:32 I disagree with the lack of natural demand. Fact is in oil and gaz there is no natural demand neither, no household wants a baril of oil in his garden. Oil and gaz false models were relying on pre recession global demand models.
8729 2018-03-26 02:55:18 Get a life - they've done nothing others haven't.  Don't live in the past.  I well remember "lolly-gate", "fingernail-gate", "hair oil/sunburn cream-gate",  and who can forget "pitch-gate".  And - we won't go into the gambling etc etc issues

8759 2018-03-26 02:49:51 Yeah I tired that before what’s a good oil to use for your face like everyday ..besides coconut
8760 2018-03-26 02:49:33 I asked Vet fairly recently about CBD oil for my mom’s ailing dog. She said there wasn’t much evidence that it works. Do you know of any sources?
8761 2018-03-26 02:49:29 Lmao it’s time for coconut oil and hair mask and good head rubs because I need to be like Rapunzel 
8762 2018-03-26 02:49:28 Like the Visa of the Oil Industry!!!! Not sure Visa would appreciate that. But thank you. Perspective gained.
8763 2018-03-26 02:48:50 I’m about to start keeping argan oil in my purse. Nothing does me better.

8769 2018-03-26 02:48:15 May not get your chance above Friday close, but it’s still early. I have 1/8th position short oil at 65.60. Will sell at 63 or add at 66.50, whichever comes first.
8770 2018-03-26 02:48:14 Also if you have tea tree oil or vicks, boil some water and put some in and do a 10 minute steam under a towel! that will really get your sinuses flowing! try to also eat a lot of soup and protein!

8778 2018-03-26 02:46:55 My essential oil diffuser arrived today along with my new pillows! 

My hope is to be able to help insomnia not effect me as much by making my bedding more comfortable & adjusting my sleep ritual to include more organic/natural ways to “get sleepy.”

My room smells so lavender-y!
8779 2018-03-26 02:46:52 The amount of grease not OIL but GREASE my face produces you could fry chicken & feed a family of 5

8782 2018-03-26 02:46:23 I know, this is bad as environmentalists claiming the oil pipeline leaked and spilled thousands of barrels of oil and demand to shut it down.. Only for us to realize they smashed the pipe open with sledgehammers. They push the environmental narrative, while destroying it.
8783 2018-03-26 02:46:14 You're aware the NEB process was a sham (NEB stacked with oil industry, & an almost entirely closed process), as were Kinder Morgan's submissions which included falsified enviro assessments where they whited out the word "draft" etc?
8784 2018-03-26 02:46:11 Meu ponto é: com oil a USD 110.00, até o mais pseudo-liberal de nossos potenciais candidatos a presidente, afora Doria, vai rever ideia hoje corrente de privatização de PETR e desalavancagem agora em curso. Com PETROBRÁS, sempre surge um ufanismo Brasil-grande... medo é esse.

8816 2018-03-26 02:42:13 @Thom_Hartmann financial news item largely unreported in the Trump-Stormy driven media, was that China will begin trading in oil/gas futures. Contracts will be traded in Yuan. China is now largest oil consumer. China is one step closer to displacing USD as reserve currency.
8817 2018-03-26 02:41:04 Which trader in his right mind would want to trade oil futures on a chinese exchange?

8819 2018-03-26 02:40:51 I think we should refine more resources in Canada not just Oil. But eco-terrorist do not want any Canadian Oil to come out of the ground. They use fear and falsehoods to paint their narratives so their paymaster can compete easier.

8825 2018-03-26 02:39:48 Unbelievable sickening. How can you be so mentally insane to pour hot oil onto your own child. Who else but your parents does a child have as their primary protection. What pure fear and pain she must have felt. What type of punishment is anywhere near appropriate?

8911 2018-03-26 02:27:56 Yeah I would ask your pediatrician if you are worried but since peppermint is the last ingredient it shouldn’t have too much, clove is what helps them with the pain and sunflower oil is a carrier oil. But I also don’t know mcuh about herb/oil use for infants. Good luck!

8989 2018-03-26 02:17:36 I never said destroy oil or the industry. We need it to move forward. It’s taken a century of oil production development to even build an EV today.

9045 2018-03-26 02:09:08 If you slice them, salt and pepper, sprinkle olive oil on them and stick them in the oven, you might. You can also try to cube them, salt, pepper and fry them in butter. But they could end up being bland to some. They're very tricky devils, making you think they're easy to cook.

9047 2018-03-26 02:08:56 Just changed my oil and now I’m a fucking pro. HMU
9048 2018-03-26 02:08:56 Do it. Research a good strand for that an it a help, even if you dont smoke it you can use the oil an cook with it an get it that way
9049 2018-03-26 02:08:30 That Sherrif wants to play the part of the Red Coats to the Ragtag Americans.... that didn’t end well for the Red Coats.
9050 2018-03-26 02:08:22 Retweeted Sarah B. MacDonald (@smackdonna):

Finally got the electric bill after having the heat pump for a couple of months.

Oil costs before: $250/month
Electric increase after: $50/month

We heat our house for $50/month!
9051 2018-03-26 02:08:19 jojoba oil is quickly becoming my holy grail skin product i hope it keeps doing good things for me
9052 2018-03-26 02:08:18 this cleansing oil is giving me life
9053 2018-03-26 02:07:58 Which company? And will it clear the oil return pipe on the Irate diesel t4 kit
9054 2018-03-26 02:07:24 Yas! The one I’ve heard of is just potatoes (any kind) and non starchy veggies. You can have them any way, but not like fried in oil. Also, no excess added salt, sugar or fat, I believe.
9055 2018-03-26 02:07:23 Oil prices rose on Monday with international Brent crude futures opening above $70 per barrel for the first time since January.
9056 2018-03-26 02:07:23 Doubt it. That data can’t account for future rise in oil prices. I know I keep hammering that point, but if you want to convince me that suburbia is sustainable, you need to convince me that it will successfully transition away from oil.
9057 2018-03-26 02:06:50 lmao i had my jar of coconut oil between my thighs while i was twisting my hair & the whole thing melted  #warmth
9058 2018-03-26 02:06:45 the oil gave her big tits and made her horny and now she has no rights
9059 2018-03-26 02:06:32 The oil is there.  If they would allow closer to FL Panhandle coast, I believe it would shock everyone.
9060 2018-03-26 02:06:32 i just felt some oil splash me
9061 2018-03-26 02:06:19 Praise like Oil
9062 2018-03-26 02:06:07 400an, beli night cream tbs dan tea tree oil. dan night cream nya ga cocok hhhh
9063 2018-03-26 02:06:07 But why would these huge oil investors/consumers move their USD holding to crypto, the effect of this in short term would be minimal IMO. Will move these into Gold/Metals whilst still holding some USD/Yuan as it is still the global currency (though weakening).
9064 2018-03-26 02:06:04 Am I doing poppers or smelling peppermint oil to get rid of my headache u be the judge
9065 2018-03-26 02:05:48 Back in ancient times, this would require rubbing Neatsfoot Oil into the leather. Why? Because dad's said so.
9066 2018-03-26 02:05:35 So you think running more tankers is the best way to move oil out of Canada for refining? Interesting.
9067 2018-03-26 02:05:24 No one. It's trash and they all taste the same, no matter where they're made. If I want a greasy mess I'll just pour oil on bread and eat that because its better than that trash y'all be trying to peddle off as amazing food.
9068 2018-03-26 02:05:21 The lamp of wisdom is fueled by the oil of contentment.
9069 2018-03-26 02:05:17 What about the crisis of transgender in military?

9070 2018-03-26 02:05:15 Really looking forward to tomorrow morning when all the Gulf Coast crude oil traders, buyers and marketers will be "experts" on the Chinese oil futures contract specs #OOTT
9071 2018-03-26 02:05:14 Omg they get so much undeserved flask!! Like even just tossing them in olive oil, salt, pepper, and then roasting them is DIVINE!!!!!! I LOVE THEM.
9072 2018-03-26 02:05:04 I haven't taught my son to change the oil in a car, but I taught him to make an Ethernet cable this week. :)

9078 2018-03-26 02:03:53 I remember nearly crapping myself a few times when Rattie played the Oil Kings as a Winterhawk. It's nice being on the positive side of him getting a chance to score
9079 2018-03-26 02:03:44 Greek philosophy should have taught you redefining a thing does not change the true nature of that thing. It will always be as it is.
9080 2018-03-26 02:03:41 I also use the OGX argon oil on my hair while it’s still damp after I wash it and then I love the Bumble and bumble curl creme (they spell it like that not sure why). I usually put some in and diffuse my hair but when my hairs longer I can just scrunch it and it works great.

9084 2018-03-26 02:03:14 everyone doing great and we dont need health care because americans do need medical care we just heal from two sippz of olive oil. not 3 tho thass oilve oil od
9085 2018-03-26 02:03:00 The technology may be there, but destroying the oil industry in one country this quickly, without having a viable replacement or jobs to replace what was taken is criminal! Why, only one country suffering the consiquences? Should be planned, slowly, for all, not forced on one!
9086 2018-03-26 02:02:56 Shattered a glass bottle of sesame oil on the kitchen floor so my apt is going to smell like a Chinese restaurant forever now

9141 2018-03-26 01:55:22 it dropped because of this thing called OPEC, and world oil prices. and I assume by frugal you'd like to have ralphie level cuts to services and infrastructure that we are still suffering from today? maybe blow up a few more hospitals for a quick buck?

9149 2018-03-26 01:54:14 Stay tuned. I'm assembling the data and interviews now, hopefully have a column soon re. heavy crude oil production by country and explanation of what those countries are doing to lower carbon-intensity. So far, it's eye-opening.

9166 2018-03-26 01:51:54 Your unquestioning support of the oil industry makes you part of the problem, not part of the solution. Why should tax payers pay for climate damage caused by oil companies destroying the environment on public land while making huge profits?

9181 2018-03-26 01:49:25 You’re describing communism. As a Canadian socialist, just no. It doesn’t work. Neither does uncontrolled capitalism. Plus, Water is not same as oil and gas-its required to live. This is a false dichotomy.
9182 2018-03-26 01:49:19 descubrí que tenía meses usando mi oil cleanser mal y desde que lo hago bien mi cara ES MÁS SUAVE QUE LA DE UN BEBÉ.
9183 2018-03-26 01:49:02 I've been talking to economists and industry reps, trying to get a handle on what other heavy oil producing jurisdictions are doing to lower carbon-intensity. The answer so far: nothing. Since global heavy crude production will be increasing, why not have Alberta lead the way?
9184 2018-03-26 01:48:58 Thanks, Stacy. The lesson encompasses a lot...clay slab work; incising; adding color with oil pastel and an ink resist wash; stringing a loom; weaving skills; color and yarn selection for emphasis, unity and texture - great fun!

9196 2018-03-26 01:47:26 Trade accounts for less than 10% of global capital flows. Oil being a part of that 10%. So whatever oil is priced in, is not as important as commonly thought.

9198 2018-03-26 01:46:55 i'm thinking of trying essential oil diffusion

maybe it'll help me not feel like complete shit
9199 2018-03-26 01:46:53 ポプテピネタだぁ………すきだ
9200 2018-03-26 01:46:51 Anyone that buys the $10 gram of oil or $1 joints and sells them for double the or triple the price is lame as fuck!  Don’t be a greedy asshole
9201 2018-03-26 01:46:41 Watched a sec. She said opposite of what she had said (denied affair.) Really couldn't continue to watch. Her pupils were completely dialated. Looked like pools of oil
9202 2018-03-26 01:46:41 Yeah right on . She doesn’t mind that oil companies and other taxpayers pay her healthcare and other bills. You lefties r so full of crap!
9203 2018-03-26 01:46:32 @Underground_RT Why does Saudi want Yemen bombed so much? No one understands. All we know is that Saudi is agreeing to trade their oil in dollars so the US dollar doesn’t fail. Please explain. Please.
9204 2018-03-26 01:46:21 Skyhook: Take a nuclear war, just 500 rads would be more challenges to definitions of the supplies of oil world wide. Good luck! Depends.

9207 2018-03-26 01:46:00 I was at the store and saw a tiny bag of granola for $7. No way, fam. Let me save you from yourselves.
Preheat your oven to 350. Put a quarter cup oil, third cup honey, third cup brown sugar, quarter cup water in a pot and bring it to a boil, then turn it off.
9208 2018-03-26 01:45:38 Just shut down the American economy which runs on oil & gas to make a crusty old curmudgeon Neil Young who never could sing a decent note happy
9209 2018-03-26 01:45:17 I'm very much anti LNG. But I'm the oil the price of oil will have to rebound to $100/bbl before anyone even thinks of LNG. For the record I think Kitimat is a poor choice for the same reasons Kitimat Clean was a poor choice. #bcpoli
9210 2018-03-26 01:45:04 After like two days that oil fixed the eczema round my eyes and got rid of the flakiness and redness. But like as a whole the two-cleanser wash cycle is like a genius move why didn't I know about it sooner

9215 2018-03-26 01:44:19 Yes. Patience. Techno-revolutions take time to become mainstream. Good book for you to read “Guns, Germs and Steel”,  it will teach you a bit about how societies adopt new technology - and the time involved. In the meantime the Canadian economy  needs oil and gas.
9216 2018-03-26 01:43:59 I just bought a small carbon steel tempura pot from Sunrise Market here in NYC. The metal is so thin, the oil heated up so fast and the temperature easier to regulate than a thick pot. My dumplings came out so much better. Next, I will test my skills at Hand-Pulled Noodles
9217 2018-03-26 01:43:51 Don’t push oil and fossil fuels that is the global warming try to@push for wind and solar energy
9218 2018-03-26 01:43:49 They're thin enough you wouldn't even need really deep oil.

9224 2018-03-26 01:42:55 good customer service moment of the day: a customer returned unused oil vaporizers after hearing they were bad for cats. I'm glad they were properly informed
9225 2018-03-26 01:42:50 The Oil isn't Flowing Everywhere 

Be where the Oil is Anointed to Flow for YOU!
9226 2018-03-26 01:42:41 The demand isn’t oil but energy. 

If more ethical options for alternative energy exist it behooves us to stop exporting something that is destroying the planet.

We have to stop rationalizing greed.
9227 2018-03-26 01:42:19 People can't believe my dog is on a plant based diet but he really loves tofu and carrots. As long as the tofu is fried in olive oil. He much prefers tofu over dog food.
9228 2018-03-26 01:42:14 I think people are drawing massive over reaching correlations between the China oil move, and that money immediately entering crypto. Long way to go boys..

9242 2018-03-26 01:39:31 Easier to target big bad oil companies.  Not to say they are not,they are motivated by profit margin
9243 2018-03-26 01:39:30 I just want someone to massage me in coconut oil till I fall asleep.

9248 2018-03-26 01:39:00 We need to be driving the price of oil up to reduce consumption not creating more infrastructure to make it cheaper and easier to abuse.

9250 2018-03-26 01:38:50 Trump/Bolton busting deal with Iran in our future.  Tensions rise.  Oil prices already heading higher.  Whatever tiny benefit working class got from @TaxScamBill evaporates at the pump as well as with tariff backlash and much higher health care premiums.  Duped again, Trumpists.
9251 2018-03-26 01:38:36 my new body oil arrived Friday. had to put it into a new bottle since the pump was broken. the new bottle was glass. there is now broken glass and body oil all over my bathroom floor.

9266 2018-03-26 01:35:51 I sous vide bacon for 24 hours or so before the griddle. That cuts down the splatter and bacon oil getting caught in rugs and drapes, and you still get some sizzle.

9268 2018-03-26 01:35:35 Shanghai gold futures aren’t near as liquid as NYMEX/CME, the gold is in RMB, there are limited currency fut to hedge, and there are cap controls. Oh, and if you speculate in the China oil future you are playing against the SOEs. But other than all that this contract is great.
9269 2018-03-26 01:35:31 Okay, I followed. Now, please, legalise weed, get us out of the TPP2, stop drilling for oil, stop police car chases, tax landlords heaps,  . . . you know, the things you said you would. Thanking you in anticipation.

To me it was really delicious, but I'm still learning. 

What did I do wrong, what could I do better or add & how would you plate it?
9273 2018-03-26 01:35:05 Just because you define it that way doesn't make it so. Like illegal aliens being immigrants. They aren't. Will stick with dictionary here

9276 2018-03-26 01:34:07 1-2 To answer your first question, we should look at the relative decline in oil prices in 2014 and 2015.  The relative decline in light crude prices was larger than the decline in heavier crudes.

9288 2018-03-26 01:32:18 last night i reflected on how reckless i was to use google map's no-toll option at night. you know, that 20 minute thru a back road of a palm oil plantation
9289 2018-03-26 01:32:00 Because the dominant stakeholder (oil co's) have no vested interest in it working. They'd rather pay Chinese workers 1/8 the wage and no healthcare.
It's cute. Everyone's sold on a plan that exports jobs as a plan necessary to create jobs.

Energy may be a necessity of modern life, oil is not. And we don't have to be part of the problem regardless.
 Alternatives exist right now. We have to stop rationalizing poor behaviour.
9293 2018-03-26 01:31:29 I've visited Bakken fields during good times few years back. It looks like you voted for trump hoping he'll do something stupid to disrupt oil supply and you guys would be back at it again.
9294 2018-03-26 01:31:10 In the early 70s a rogue MD sold my mother a ton of BS for her migraines. SodBicarb aperitifs with cooking oil chasers, unroasted peanuts, histamine injections. The whole family had to take the stuff even though she had the headaches. We were broke and this made it worsr.
9295 2018-03-26 01:31:06 Absolutely beautiful! Is this oil?
9296 2018-03-26 01:31:01 Partially yes. "Seasonal factors" coupled with higher oil prices.

9298 2018-03-26 01:30:38 Two weeks later, my neck is still super messed up from remaking my scale model for scenic class. I've tried heating pads, stretches, tiger balm, peppermint oil, and not sitting like an idiot who doesn't care about their spine.

9302 2018-03-26 01:29:42 Tip of the day:

When you buy an uncoooked cheese pizza to oven-bake, you can throw whatever you like on it. Extra cheese. Meat. Veggies. Spices. Olive oil drizzle is also fab.

I did that earlier and made a pair of custom pizzas. Margerita w basil and pepproni-tomato-olive.
9303 2018-03-26 01:29:15 Trouble is, real doctors are bound by professional ethics and regulations, whereas NDs are effectively unregulated and able to sell snake oil and false hope.
9304 2018-03-26 01:29:04 i wanna do another oil painting but it'd be my first big project outside of school and i don't wanna spend a bunch of money to fuck up and idk where to start
9305 2018-03-26 01:29:04 I love the spicy cauliflower at Sahara. But it's lightly breaded and deep fried.  So I bought a head, broke it up, tossed it all in a little oil, vinegar and cayenne pepper and roasted it until it was soft.  Dipped it tzatziki and it works!  :). Just an FYI.
9306 2018-03-26 01:28:59 Haha.. Sweet potato chips baked with olive oil, mashed with a bit of butter, salt and pepper, baked sweet potato, cut open with cheese or chilli on top.. What's not to like lol?

9324 2018-03-26 01:24:41 I just put beard oil on my hair... I mean it seemed practical 
9325 2018-03-26 01:24:37 is it turning orange? because mine did that too at the ends lol, make sure you get your ends clipped and do hot oil treatments. It won’t help with color but it’ll help with shedding/breakage. Put a red rinse on top for color

9327 2018-03-26 01:24:17 Swordfish have a gland next to their noses that secretes oil, this coats its head so it can repel water and make it easier for them to swim

9329 2018-03-26 01:23:55 Also she can’t risk an arrest record possibly impeding her ability to fly to various and assorted countries and locales to bitch about Canadian oil.
9330 2018-03-26 01:23:55 No you did not, just confused why sweet blend producers such as Nigeria and Algeria sell less oil then heavier blend producers such as KSA and Iraq.

9333 2018-03-26 01:22:57 Before my diagnosis, I never in a million years would have imagined how much snake oil there is out there, and how cancer patients become a target for these charlatans. Sadly, it seems a lucrative market.
9334 2018-03-26 01:22:32 I tend to shoot these with a poisoned .50 Calibre round and let em wash ashore... It is waaaay to much work to actually use these for food or oil. Kill em and dump em I say ! #whalesareforkilling
9335 2018-03-26 01:22:28 I’ll be 18 in 10 days n can hardly bring my car to get an oil change my myself lord send me help
9336 2018-03-26 01:22:18 A teaspoon of oil dropped into the sea calms half an acre of water. British lifeboats carried it to calm seas on rescue missions.
9337 2018-03-26 01:22:11 I'm recommending to add on to your Soybean oil positions as it ready to give a daily buy at 32.43 and a Weekly Buy signal at 32.81a pound. Dry conditions moving back in. Add on to wheat if we get a setback. Stay long corn and soybeans. #soybeans #Commodities #ETF #Farming

9339 2018-03-26 01:21:37 Look for oatmeal as a main ingredient in a treatment/shampoo to help with sensitive skin. Throw on a little spritz of coconut oil afterward for some added spa vibes that actually help!
9340 2018-03-26 01:21:35 No, they are NOT paying for the wall. That was just one more bottle of snake oil you bought.
9341 2018-03-26 01:21:31 God wrote the Constitution?? okay, I know obviously they didn't have regular cameras back then, but PLEASE tell me someone nearby at least tried to knock out like a quick halfway decent oil painting of the big guy with the quill in his hand.
9342 2018-03-26 01:21:27 I've used food grade organic neem oil on my skin for about a year now and it really helps with inflammation from acne, rashes or bug bites. My skin is super sensitive to loads of stuff and neem oil has helped calm it down after reactions.

9361 2018-03-26 01:18:20 You do realize that O&G prices worldwide were responsible for the drop in the industry right? Why do people keep insisting that our revenue problem is because we don’t “incentivize” a multi billion dollar industry enough? Like Kenney is going to raise the price of oil magically.

Would it be to America's benefit to produce their oil so as to not rely on other countries?
9366 2018-03-26 01:16:51 Commodities are weak but the Crude oil is still going very strong. How long the trend will continue? It is not cooling off.

9392 2018-03-26 01:13:21 Yo I hate these oil memes
9393 2018-03-26 01:13:17 Sounds like an excellent argument for supporting our own safe and responsible Canadian oil industry, rather than continuing to import it from dodgy foreign sources.

But that's not what your US-backers are paying Greenpeace for, now is it, eh, Mikey?

9404 2018-03-26 01:10:46 Sounds lovely. How long do they stay moisturized then? I've never heard of neem oil!
9405 2018-03-26 01:10:43 Sunny Butter does NOT contain coconut oil. My hair absolutely hates coconut oil, and I've learned that a lot of the natural hair community hates coconut oil on the strands. So, in an effort to make Sunny Butter multi-functional, I kept the body AND hair in mind.
9406 2018-03-26 01:10:33 I can understand why patients run to this stuff. They are scared. Heck, she is my dearest friend and I am terrified. But they should not be allowed to sell snake oil to placate our fears. We need real treatments. #killing

9442 2018-03-26 01:04:11 Yeah I get what you mean. I did a lot of research before I actually put it on my skin and it turns out baking soda can help balance out the oil and it has like vitamin E or something so it reduces inflammation and encourages scars to heal. But thank you for looking out for me 
9443 2018-03-26 01:04:07 That's why I stick to Shea & cocoa butter mixed together. I add a few drops of neem oil too.

No other combos work or make sense(like 1+a or 2+b or a+b..) It’s a classic case when it gets direct translated, it still holds certain meaning. (Such as oil room).

9470 2018-03-26 01:01:20 I get the environmental concerns for shipping it along the coast. I think we need to negotiate harder to sell crude instead of Bitumen.

I just made the most expensive crispy shrimp ever. Because I don't have vegetable oil on hand because... I don't know why... I just fried shrimp in olive oil.

9505 2018-03-26 00:56:29 China trading oil for yuan undermines the #petrodollar. Much of the value of $USD is maintained as a consequence of the hegemony of the petrodollar. $BTC stands to benefit from a weakened dollar in terms of price appreciation and increased adoption as a means to store value.
9506 2018-03-26 00:56:24 I agree. BC needs it to lower gas prices,AB & Canada need it for income.But BC has a lot of short sighted people that don't understand economics.They want oil gone but have no clue about replacing the income. It's like children that have everything handed to them w/ no value of $
9507 2018-03-26 00:56:23 we should be scaling back not because of the climate, but becaue the economics of extracting oil from clay and sand is ridiculous and only going to get worse not better...   please raise your hand if you like spending $1.20 to earn $1?

9510 2018-03-26 00:55:38 If we wanted their oil why wouldn't we obliterate them and establish territory in the area? Caring about civilian casualties is why we haven't won yet. I'm not saying kill the civilians, rather that terrorists are exploiting the fact that we don't want to kill civilians

9531 2018-03-26 00:52:59 we're not fighting against sheep herders. & if we wanted to obliterate them, we would. but in general people actually care about civilian fatalities, & we want their oil, so we can't just blow them up. so i mean, if you have oil that the government wants, i guess that would help.

9535 2018-03-26 00:52:43 It's amazing what happens when the oil & gas industry has access to tidewater, like Texas does. Don't worry, the NDP are working on it, something the PCs didn't do in 44 years

9550 2018-03-26 00:50:01 Oil is at $65 a barrel we should be fine but we are not.  Hmm maybe because most of the business left for the states due to all regulations and taxes.
9551 2018-03-26 00:50:00 PST only needs to be revenue neutral in year 1, after that the PST revenue would increase faster than other forms of tax (e.g. income tax) during the economic recovery. If PST is to replace depend on nonrenewable taxes, then when Oil bounces back, the Corp tax shld stay same.
9552 2018-03-26 00:49:33 I swear they make changing your oil a difficult task so you just say screw it and take it in.
9553 2018-03-26 00:49:31 might add coconut oil or cream and see if that does it
9554 2018-03-26 00:49:31 I could rebut this (not happening where I am), but are you going to address the fundamental flaw in centering the suburban model around cars when oil gets expensive? There’s going to be a day when gas is $5-$10 a gallon. Pools and gardens won’t save that.
9555 2018-03-26 00:49:04 that's social media chat - get with the program - you seem really upset -  must be tough supporting a self admitted sexual molester - is that why you are the way you are - all choked up - did you catch the Stormy interview - your main man the adulterer - great role model for kids

9604 2018-03-26 00:40:11 Endless oil story
9605 2018-03-26 00:40:07 Build the wall through a foreign nation? Yeah good luck with that, Trump. Mexico does not have enough oil to warrant dishing out some All-American Liberty (imperialism).
9606 2018-03-26 00:40:01 prefer my oil diffusers over candles
9607 2018-03-26 00:39:49 I'm telling you!!! Sheesh. So glad I have this melanin and oil. Bc you know our oily skin helps us too.

9609 2018-03-26 00:39:25 Bandit loooooves his new fish oil. it's chocolate flavoured but won't harm a dog of his size.
9610 2018-03-26 00:39:08 Proverbs 13:9 (KJV)
9 The light of the righteous rejoiceth: but the lamp of the wicked shall be put out.

Matthew 25:7-8 (KJV)
7 Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.

8 And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.

The 67.67 primary target is coming up fast. Regardless of an extension or not, the upcoming wave 4 Inflection is generally not one to trifle with on the long side. Wave 5, fwiw, targets towards 10.
9613 2018-03-26 00:38:28 This morning I ironed my pants in the kitchen and almost sprayed cooking oil on them instead of Febreeze.
9614 2018-03-26 00:38:16 the Indian okra dish isn't breaded and fried....it's cooked with oil and mustard seeds, and I think a pinch of salt. it'll feel slimy in your mouth as you chew them.
9615 2018-03-26 00:38:14 I agree with you that population is a problem, not for orangutans it’s about forests being cleared to grow palm oil for $.
9616 2018-03-26 00:37:59 Hayvn wastes oil on my phone blown my screen is messed up smdh!!!!!!
9617 2018-03-26 00:37:56 changing oil is therapeutic y'all
9618 2018-03-26 00:37:55 So did “the man who called the 2018 top in oil” jump the gun with humble brag tweets?

9622 2018-03-26 00:36:57 Didn't think it possible to make an interview with a porn star as flat & wooden as Anderson Cooper did, exceeding my expectations. He approached the job with the enthusiasm of taking a teaspoon of cod liver oil. Retire the pointless, tiresome "Devil's advocate" questions will ya?
9623 2018-03-26 00:36:55 aggggggghhh I gotta get an oil change

1000000% Yes friend
9628 2018-03-26 00:36:26 You’re so welcome! If the coconut isn’t hydrating enough they make an olive oil version for SUPER SUPER DAMAGED hair but that one was always too greasy for me!
9629 2018-03-26 00:36:17 Kalau rontok banget bisa pake Minoxidil, ada yg merk lokal juga kok over the counter. Kalau ketombe dan rontoknya nggak parah bisa coba masker rambut pake coconut oil setiap sebelum keramas.

9636 2018-03-26 00:34:25 Face the facts. Communist Cuba has been meddling in Venezuela since the presidency of Romulo Betancourt. Vendetta started when Betancourt refused to give away free oil to greedy Castro.
9637 2018-03-26 00:34:16 If dude wants 2try a little sociology experiment, he can join a FB oil field group & announce “I respect ur right to disagree but I think Notley is doing great & y’all are giving Trudeau a bad rap!” The responses ain’t gonna “I disagree but respect ur point of view good sir”
9638 2018-03-26 00:34:16 It sounds good but drugs have side effects.  Did you know that 2 tablespoons of coconut oil in porridge or other hot food per day also combats Alzheimer's.  And it is healthy!!!  I think it should be recommended for all seniors to both treat and prevent dementia.
9639 2018-03-26 00:34:07 Soros is a piece of shit, but that's still not a legitimate reason to support a failed drug war that terrorizes innocent Americans.
9640 2018-03-26 00:33:39 Put a little Carols Daughter oil in my hair and now I can’t see the slight blue tint
9641 2018-03-26 00:33:39 Oil Barrel. Roll it, damages troops, and at the end burning oil spills out like a poison spell and damages anything in the area for sometime.

9646 2018-03-26 00:32:26 We make a dry dish by just adding grated Lauki to Mustard Oil, Turmeric, salt & Green Chili. It's out of the world and can be had with chapati or as a sandwich spread. Even kids love it!
9647 2018-03-26 00:32:25 Our benchmark here was the surviving grad school bath, featuring wine and a few shitty candles. New features include a Jacuzzi tub, oil diffuser, plate of snacks, clay face mask, and a ton of leftover votive candles from my wedding
9648 2018-03-26 00:32:07 Data is new oil and everyone using data to their benefit and advantage. Nothing wrong if anyone using it for votes.
9649 2018-03-26 00:31:59 Gonna try to give bio oil another shot
9650 2018-03-26 00:31:36 Venezuela ranks number 1 in oil reserves. Yet they are starving due to their socialism. BTW Exactly the government DEMS want for America
9651 2018-03-26 00:31:35 'I've got a present for you,' she said.

'What's that?' he asked.

She pulled her proud breasts out of her low-cut blouse. They were large and gleaming with oil.

'Happy my anniversary, baby,' she said.

9652 2018-03-26 00:31:26 Being a Scorpio w/ a Libra twist is some crazy shit. Its like trying to mix oil w/ water. Not on some depressive shit, but on some mind racing shit. The challenge is fun tho!
9653 2018-03-26 00:31:16 Agree. And Nathan gets huge credit for it, but not all him. Teams improved special teams (pk from 29th to 3rd) helps along with better goaltending. Just like MCD couldn't control either of those alone for Oil and why they are out. :)
9654 2018-03-26 00:31:16 Good reason to not drill for oil don't you think?
9655 2018-03-26 00:30:57 Trader Joes  wild salmon in a can . Boneless and Skinless..Lissen!

9662 2018-03-26 00:29:10 You can shine leather shoes with a cloth and some vegetable oil.
9663 2018-03-26 00:28:32 am i the only person who remembers seeing the famous "drowning in oil" cover on the economist when oil hit its low?
9664 2018-03-26 00:27:57 Let's see...Romney bankrupts Massachusetts as Governor with Romneycare and Palin goes after the oil companies profits to help all Alaskans and the MSM castigates her. You and they are mysoginists...pure and simple.
9665 2018-03-26 00:27:47 try pine nuts too, just a little browning in some olive oil, they aren't cheap though!
9666 2018-03-26 00:27:39 "We didn't elect him to be a husband or pastor."

9672 2018-03-26 00:25:53 I'm useless to you as I use no product. When it's longer, I use a dry oil on the ends. Divine Oil by Caudelie. I also let it dry naturally when it's warm. Very low maintenance.

9677 2018-03-26 00:24:29 How are you going to repurpose all that sprawl? Cities are greener than suburbs to begin with. Unless they make suburbs more walkable, there’s going to be problems with rising oil prices later.
9678 2018-03-26 00:24:25 I love my glass nail file, I've got one in my bag, one in my nail tools box and one in my bedside table draw lol. Jojoba oil pens are stashed all over the place too.

9693 2018-03-26 00:20:37 Putin's biggest weakness: dictatorships do not thrive economically -- they are extractive, not innovative. The Russian economy is highly fragile to the price of oil & gas on one hand, and the other hand must be territorially acquisitive (Crimea, e. g., & puppet states)

9710 2018-03-26 00:17:56 I found out the secret to Weed Pen is leaving the THC cartridges on top of my Verizon FiOS cable box overnight it melts the oil and thus draws like a pencil by morning. Going to Trader Joe’s right before close ripped as fuck wish me luck
9711 2018-03-26 00:17:48 I need a new oil diffuser.
9712 2018-03-26 00:17:47 Cut or uncut. But always with oil...
9713 2018-03-26 00:17:41 Desperate attempt at ratings for a show hardly anyone watches. IF true, I doubt it, at best this is tabloid trash TV. Jerry Springer style

9715 2018-03-26 00:17:23 How about boiling oil on the rooftop.
9716 2018-03-26 00:17:22 Well, the Saudis, sitting in a sand pit of a country with all the oil money in the world, asked themselves:

"Why don't we just buy Europe?  We all like it much more than this dump.  We can just buy all their politicians.

And they did.  

It's called the Barcelona Declaration.
9717 2018-03-26 00:16:42 Im happy my DE doesn’t have oil issues :)
9718 2018-03-26 00:16:35 I can not wait to get my hands on my essential oil diffuser

9720 2018-03-26 00:16:25 So that’s a step treatment for your nighttime regimen. You use gycolic serum first then add the oil.
9721 2018-03-26 00:16:09 Time to paint my face with rose hip oil and pig out on calimari 
9722 2018-03-26 00:16:08 Well, let's address WW2, where superior Nazi rifles were freezing due to their oil. Yes, condition can change a weapon's effectiveness, but that's a slight of hand trick you're pulling; a ruse. A knife is deadlier than an AR-15 if you're attacking someone 2 feet away.

9729 2018-03-26 00:14:28 Yes and I cannot disagree with you on that point, tomorrow I may get hit by a car but I still will go out for a walk and one day Mt. Baker will blow as well. Before I start protesting I want to see the detail plans for oil spill prevention and response and more dialogue with FNs
