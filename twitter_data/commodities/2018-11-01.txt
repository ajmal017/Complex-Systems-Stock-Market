60 2018-11-01 19:20:15 Yup, was going thru this earlier today... unusually large gap now.

Smart money pumped oil by 20-25 $ on newsflow & dumped. Equities is the only game in town with what’s happening to metals, bonds, commodities. Gives a melt up phase feeling but investors still in denial.
61 2018-11-01 19:19:40 This Increment of minimum wage has it's own bad side sef. I think it will lead to increase of price of commodities which will be too harsh to the common man on the street that doesn't earn shi shi salary!

68 2018-11-01 18:37:28 If you scan the rest of the market, commodities, for example that represent economic output/demand, have been selling off for awhile.  This group has yet to find a base.  So, I wouldn’t think equities have either.  We’ll see.
69 2018-11-01 18:36:22 Most economists and business folks see sustained high rate growth through 2023 to 2026 with a leveling of to normalcy at that point.

I noticed the dry bulk shipping stocks are bumping. Jim, do you think it is that part of the Cycle for Shippers and maybe even commodities and emerging markets like 2007 & 2008 ?

Please discuss on your show

Thank You

110 2018-11-01 16:44:09 So you’re making zero effort to increase your consumption of American commodities, got it. Fake Patriots will do that, nothing 
111 2018-11-01 16:43:59 Its very common for mullahs to use religion for their greed and rule over people in the fear of the religion, informing they know our religion, our prophet, our Allah better than us. jis se pucho, toh firqa pakar ke bethay, musalman nahi, business commodities ban gaye hain.
112 2018-11-01 16:43:06 I agree, I really don't see much of a difference between ETFs and crypto assets. 

I prefer ETFs for commodities myself. 

One was started by Blackrock, while the other random people, devs, and entrepreneurs.

116 2018-11-01 16:18:52 I agree there is no good system in place. But, I do not get the impression that those in power care about our coverage as much as what their donors want them to do. Empires are built on commodities. And monetizing health means everyone is a potential customer.
117 2018-11-01 16:07:16 Dollarization for transition in the short and medium term.  Not long term.  For that we (and we will) have straight up crypto, tokenized commodities, and commodity backed stablecoins.
118 2018-11-01 16:06:32 You are confusing individualism for Independence and freedom. I'll contribute to society predicated on what benefits are necessary for a community and not provide certain individuals with commodities based on force and mob rule.
119 2018-11-01 16:05:40 I am very surprised at all such news in media which started with Agro One. This might be intention of the Govt but the ordinance doesn't deregulate trade in Agri Commodities.

120 2018-11-01 16:02:02 In recession commodities prices sky rockets . Electricity can be as cheap as not under recession . Plus maintenance costs lesser . So sales should be higher compared with conventional cars .
121 2018-11-01 16:00:38 When I think of Govt policy and financial markets I think of Mr. John Corzine. Former $GS CEO and Governor of NJ & whose company MF Global’s $40B implosion from commodities trading in which $1.6B of client funds went missing, resulted in a major decline in the stock market.

124 2018-11-01 15:27:23 Not to mention high-powered businessmen rarely have the well being of workers in mind, but rather view them as disposable commodities and a means to an end. This is abundantly apparent in this scenario where the workers/players are uncompensated, and mostly poor black kids.
125 2018-11-01 15:19:59 You seem to be talking about value in some entirely inscrutable yet precise way that isn't how I've encountered it being used. I mean commodities existed before capitalism and and commodities only exist in so far as they serve some purpose, ie have value.
126 2018-11-01 15:12:36 Can @OKZimbabwe please look into the goings on at OK Kuwadzana 2. Staff there r taking commodities out thru back door. They have people queing fr c/oil for hrs on end. And this is on top of their bad service

130 2018-11-01 14:53:17 Pelo visto temos que procurar vender nossas commodities para outro país. Ou, seguir para a industrialização interna. EUA e China estão em trade war no momento, e uma traição do Brazil aos chineses poderia ser bastante influenciável aos americanos. Más o que ganhariamos? Cuidado.
131 2018-11-01 14:53:10 I don't understand what you mean by  "dominant operative phenomena" then because it seems like value is something that has always had to exist to exchange commodities in the first place, which seems pretty dominant to me.
132 2018-11-01 14:52:55 On second thoughts, indeed ED is sincere. How can we dispute that sincerity when our land is dripping with milk & honey ranging from the ballooning price of bread and numerous other basic commodities? ED is consistently sincere on making sure that subalterns are pauperised.

146 2018-11-01 13:47:57 [I]n all cases, for all commodities that serve to provide for the tangible or intangible need of the consumer, it is in the consumer’s best interest that labor and trade remain free, because the freedom of labor and trade have as their necessary and permanent result the maximum..
147 2018-11-01 13:47:25 I’m supportive of digital commodities like “bit gold” when the objective scarcity of time/energy is utilized as a proof (unforgeable scarcity as you put it). If this cost is pared w/lasting utility, great..but in no case does it lead to a zero sum altering golds cost/utility f(x)

155 2018-11-01 13:22:33 HFT

Crude oil and commodities cannot have their prices grossly inflated by HFT for too long, as a black market would be created trading those in real human prices. 

That is not the case with stocks and currencies. Those are digital, not real assets.
156 2018-11-01 13:20:16 In the examples I give, the work is almost entirely done by marketing. The work rarely has to speak for itself, but the marketing teams that built those reality TV stars into commodities have done all of the work to build that book.

Dear, hervia

Hi, This is seungri yang (I ordered your products and DHL Tracking Number is #7351766715 )

I’m about to get my commodities, but I had some problem related with customs clearance in Korea.

To solve my problem, I need new invoice which includes,
222 2018-11-01 07:57:34 Couple with the fact that prices of commodities in market is very high: how can you feed, clothe, transport, pay rent and so on with 30k monthly? But we want to fight corruption. A man whose salary can't pay bills is bound to collect bribe even if it's not a good reason.
223 2018-11-01 07:51:29 What was USP or UVP 6 months back, it's commodity now, software world has taken commoditisation to different level, either continuous evolve, learn and adopt - or left behind and pay high fees for consuming commodities sold as SaaS
224 2018-11-01 07:47:47 People, politics, diplomacy as Neoliberal commodities AND jobs for business buddies...planning on breaking the diplomatic union worker guidelines by any chance?
225 2018-11-01 07:47:25 Iyi tainzwa honourable, ko makutiiwo ne skyrocketing of prices of basic commodities.

Lobola subject women to be commodities
231 2018-11-01 07:06:19 The more you consume, the less you live. Commodities are the opium of the people.

233 2018-11-01 07:00:41 Commodities loaded #Ftse back on the slide. -0.65%
234 2018-11-01 06:47:54 The problem with many businesses is that they see people as commodities. We are objects to be bought, sold or traded so the business can make more money. The biggest flaw in a business approach to the world is that the businessman thinks his $ make him  better than the rest of us
235 2018-11-01 06:41:21 Does the lifting of restrictions on basic commodities solve the money crisis we have or it promotes black market, bcz for someone to go to SA or Botswana to buy grocery, he or she needs forex, yet we are using bond which can nt work outside Zim, so black market is promoted.
236 2018-11-01 06:40:45 The main issue here is not even the #300,000 it's hyping of commodities which the traders will affiliate that is the case here.
237 2018-11-01 06:38:53 They kept building Manhattan size ghost cities expecting to get filled up by the people who couldn't afford those luxuries. That provided demand for commodities such as steel, cement, copper, aluminum... that again the Chinese government financed building of factories

239 2018-11-01 06:33:15 That's all good news for the US that doesn't have a significance reliance on the Chinese markets yet the consumers and businesses will benefit from lower commodities prices
240 2018-11-01 06:18:56 CS Kiunjuri why did you allow in the first instance the maize to be spoilt whereas there are available ways of preserving the same.Or you care less because government commodities are there to be wasted?.One of your duties is to protect the government from wastage of good food.

250 2018-11-01 05:27:12 I'm sorry, we are not in this together Mr President. All your basic commodities are readily available. A meal per day is what's keeping some of us alive. Let me remind you of the fact that unemployment is rising faster than reemployment, just compare the figures.

254 2018-11-01 04:43:05 Its guaranteed him a nice pay out.  Trading in commodities is his game. This time its his reputation and public image.
255 2018-11-01 04:40:47 I see what you're saying but A.

These neanderthal coaches need to go. The best coaches of all time treated their players like their own sons, not commodities on a roster.

Durkin needs to never set foot on an athletic field ever again.

257 2018-11-01 04:32:48 Unchecked capitalism means that sooner or later people become commodities. We have seen this far too many times
258 2018-11-01 04:30:33 The digestive commodities block the new forests.
259 2018-11-01 04:22:01 Also at least in the early parts of capital he's talking about the value of commodities.
260 2018-11-01 04:13:14 So your argument is make everything legal and let the consumers decide? Well that’s a recipe for disaster. There’s a damn good reason why we have government regulation of food, drugs, insurance, commodities, etc. Because unbridled markets are dangerous to your health and savings.
261 2018-11-01 04:06:04 Nothing but Waste of money. Farmer committed suicide,essential commodities are increasing day by day, petrol likes gold.such a crucial situation how government spoiled money........ Realy achcha din aaya...
262 2018-11-01 03:59:19 This is true only if they live in New York or California where most commodities are overpriced.
263 2018-11-01 03:56:15 These skills are what determines what we can make, that's in terms of commodities and money.

Pres ED assured  RTGS :Bond =Usd 
But Prices of commodities &services are skyrocketing. If u want to buy cheap they demand (usd).
What is the Govt doing abt it,
It's almost 3 to 4 weeks now ?
Salaries, wages and savings hv been eroded. 
What do we call that process?
265 2018-11-01 03:40:09 Capitalism thrives on your addiction, it thrives on your weakness in the face of its tantalizing, poisonous, commodities.
266 2018-11-01 03:36:35 Indian #Railways increases #freight rates by 8.75% for key commodities  like coal, iron, iron ore, steel, steel raw material. Indian Railways to  earn Rs 3,344 cr from freight rate increase
267 2018-11-01 03:06:25 The Chicago commodities exchange pit has nothing on kids after trick-or-treating on Halloween night.  It's a shark feeding frenzy.
268 2018-11-01 02:51:16 I heard today that China's economy is down 20% for the year. I'm optimistic that they're getting close to realizing they need some good quality US corn, beans, and other commodities.
269 2018-11-01 02:48:10 Biglang nag pop up sa utak ko, sa luho walang problema kahit mahal, pero pag basic commodities na nag mahal ang daming hinga. Hahahaha it's nice to be relevant sa panahong ito
270 2018-11-01 02:41:10 Digital assets are commodities, commodity node is a digital asset node. Two languages one concept.
271 2018-11-01 02:36:18 This is #FakeNews
You cite no reference to back up your claims. If what you said were true, the futures for these commodities would be in the tank on the stock market.
That it's not the case.
You're lying for political gain.

272 2018-11-01 02:32:26 Em resumo, a China ficou pistola por declarações do Bolsonaro durante e depois da campanha e ameaça se retirar de acordos recíprocos, o que pode ser prejudicial pro Brasil na exportação de commodities
273 2018-11-01 02:31:30 Privatized healthcare is a drain on the economy more than singlepayer healthcare ever could be.  I don't have much choice as to who I can see with my insurance because some doctors are more expensive than others.  Y'know what's scary?  Viewing the lives of people as commodities.
274 2018-11-01 02:27:18 Finally true news on how bad commodities are doing in China... let's help the Chinese people suffering with the poor govt decisions!

279 2018-11-01 02:09:29 Sorry. This is just wrong. Mafias don’t run health ministries, offer mandatory basic education, subsidize commodities, oversee universal conscription, have soccer teams.  Many states, however, do lots of nasty things.
280 2018-11-01 01:51:05 The creators of the spgsci LONG only commodity index...selling historical backwardation as if commodities were meant for being passive investments #commodities
281 2018-11-01 01:48:00 By the way, I was one of the lead staffers on the **bipartisan** Senate PSI investigation and report into bank involvement in physical commodities—which helped prompt the rule. And it wasn’t about beer cans for us. Read the report.
282 2018-11-01 01:47:44 Now you have comfirmed that shelves are empty and prizes of basic commodities have sky-rocketed and the grounds can't hold anymore because of the fraudulence of your Presidency!
283 2018-11-01 01:44:53 Sure it can, they are participating in society by paying taxes, buying cars, homes etc and are using everyday commodities.  Was this just thought of?
284 2018-11-01 01:38:21 Life might be easier! Climate control. I’m just few thousand acres dryland commodities in NW Okla. Fighting the elements like everyone else.
285 2018-11-01 01:33:49 Joel, você é filósofo ou economista?
Você tem razão, é necessário integrar-se no mercado global para gerar riqueza, mas, a dependência da China é prejudicial para o Brasil.
Exportamos muita commodities e não trabalhamos ela, Brasil precisa criar uma "independência industrial"...
286 2018-11-01 01:28:46 Wow you are really digging into the EW theory! I don't think it is given that I don't see an expanding triangle. Go check out @FibboSR charts as he covers the major indices, commodities and forex and I believe I came across such scenarios in his charts.
287 2018-11-01 01:13:08 Quer fazer reforma agrária num país dependente de exportação de soja. Tá “serto”.  A China só compra commodities. Depois quer culpar o zapzap por não ser reeleito.
288 2018-11-01 01:10:41 Quero ver um governante, um só, que acabe com nosso vício em vender commodities
289 2018-11-01 01:09:47 Sex is not work. Human bodies are not commodities to be bought and sold.
290 2018-11-01 00:55:16 Sim. Mas digo que essas políticas não se aplicam tão bem, ao meu ver, numa economia industrial que tem como base commodities. Só isso. Sou favor da abertura de concorrência para bancos, tecnologia e comunicação, transporte, e outras. Mas commodities tenho receio. Vou estudar mais
291 2018-11-01 00:41:13 All this reverse in price of items listed is not possible,e.g when price per barrel was it's highest peak,fuel wasn't sold at time price. Compare the price now and same applies to other commodities but anyway may b u can break it down
292 2018-11-01 00:30:04 The persistent weakness in Crude, persistent strength in the dollar had me trim just a little today related stocks. 
I am looking for a trigger led by the $AUD $NZD as key, confirmed by Crude for  EM and commodities to bottom.
Might be China stimulus, Fed policy, or both.

298 2018-11-01 00:12:26 Sad for you that babies are now commodities and no not all people are doing better and our deficit is out of control but hey don’t worry. Make money
299 2018-11-01 00:06:10 I voted leave and would do so again as I believe our future generations deserve more than they’ll ever get while we are under the thumb of the EU. Once Britain is regionalised under EU plans, people will have no power and simply be commodities on minimum wages for rich companies
