154 2018-04-08 23:34:42 You are welcome :)
155 2018-04-08 23:34:40 (2) Quantum Computers within 8-10 years will be able to solve every theoretical equation in minutes. Our computers today would need about 2 billion years to compute that. QC will crack today’s cryptography in seconds meaning that bitcoin will be compromised.
156 2018-04-08 23:34:14 Crypto donations to allow revers osomosis water system or to subsidize the purchase and installation of them. Or start a token called releife token based off the #xrp #ripple system.
157 2018-04-08 23:34:05 $SUB up over 10.84% past 24 hours #Cryptocurrency #Crypto
158 2018-04-08 23:34:01 Thank you very much,you are welcome and i hope my work will be helpful :)
159 2018-04-08 23:33:49 I was never a fan of Phil but this s garbage. You are pretending that a crypto personality is a legit celeb and could be ruining his life. There is seriously no value added to the crypto world with this story. #clickbait.
160 2018-04-08 23:32:55 Oh. So TRX isn't down 85% from it's ATH while BTC is down 65% in the same time frame?
161 2018-04-08 23:32:47 Would you rather....
162 2018-04-08 23:32:43 Lol
163 2018-04-08 23:32:42 C’mon, admit your secret identity as crypto-vintner and stop trying to mislead us with a humblebrag.
164 2018-04-08 23:32:21 Eh? Wat is dit nu weer voor een comment?
165 2018-04-08 23:32:12 Lovely!
166 2018-04-08 23:32:05 Hold on, Rockefeller in crypto now and nobody told me?
167 2018-04-08 23:32:03 You do.
168 2018-04-08 23:31:59 Go short, go long, go short go long. wth lol. Luke what's up.
169 2018-04-08 23:31:53 Was late and bought at 25 sats an hour ago and it already went down to 23 sats. Haha. But yeah...  I see a lot of potential mid to long-term, too.
170 2018-04-08 23:31:38 I'm selling everything then. So the whole point of crypto is to buy let it go up a couple cents and sell. Thanks for the tip
171 2018-04-08 23:31:32 probability high to test 6k again, yes
172 2018-04-08 23:31:31 Join the #TronBulls now ! And be apart of the most innovated crypto to date !
173 2018-04-08 23:31:23 Nice. Should make it a repo, So all can contribute? I’d change some of the wording so it’s more align to the terms we often use. 

Like don’t roll your own crypto, and ‘four eyes’ principle etc...
174 2018-04-08 23:31:08 In order to kill a blockchain, some entity could create a hack to an exchange, then courts scramble to rescue investors and order a compulsory fork despite no fault to the crypto security. Repeat the hack at other exchanges at different times. Ten forks result.
175 2018-04-08 23:31:07 Thank you
176 2018-04-08 23:30:54 SO WHAT TOKENS/crypto DO WE TRADE ON THE LIGHTNING NETWORK WITH?
177 2018-04-08 23:30:46 The more research I do on quantum computing the more I realize how blind people are fighting over trivial things such as politics & altcoins. I’m well aware the NSA is involved, but Curious if there are crypto players like @RivetzCorp preparing to stay ahead of this threat. (1)

190 2018-04-08 23:29:46 Definitely A.  Here's why, the market is showing signs of reversal similar to that of the correction following the 2014 move up.  TA shows Bitcoin bottoming and finding trouble moving lower in the past 7 days.  Bitcoin 3k (highly unlikely) Bitcoin 6K (slightly likely).

338 2018-04-08 22:59:17 Bitcoin is the first decentralized crypto-currency and has completely become “Market-Driven” on its pricing.  While there still is up to a 10% margin of arbitration between the Bitcoin Exchanges worldwide, generally the “Markets” drive the price of Bitcoin up and down.

Those are scams.
344 2018-04-08 22:58:37 I think multiple parties can be at fault:

Bitgrail for not issuing the patch in due time

Nano for having an exploit in the API (big if true)

The users for trusting anyone but themselves with their crypto

When it comes to computer security, it's never a single party blame game
345 2018-04-08 22:58:35 I ask the same question in Australia, they class Crypto as an asset here If you hold your crypto. If you trade then it's declared as income. From what I understand also is that if you hold for longer than 12 months there is a reduced tax rate for your asset.

427 2018-04-08 22:44:55 I don't doubt that, I knew that Haaretz cited him as Jewish at one point, etc. I am just looking for more evidence to argue the case, that's all. I believe there are a lot more crypto-Jews and others that might as well be.

432 2018-04-08 22:44:12 You don’t have to be good @notsofast, that makes it more chill. :) more like crypto decompress time.
433 2018-04-08 22:44:07 There has been gradual progress throughout human history. There is no magic bullet or panacea. Crypto may be a next chapter in that ongoing evolution, sure, but everything has limits and life goes on.

447 2018-04-08 22:40:38 I am not a financial advisor, but probably something along the lines of crypto, when noone wants to invest in it, and when everyone hates it.

456 2018-04-08 22:39:15 books wont teach u everything about this crypto market but i feel you. just arguing they would save that person a lot of money & make them even more. consider its 5 people whove been at this for years,  he would still have to hustle but it would def shorten their learning curve.
457 2018-04-08 22:39:05 Stock and crypto does not correlate as much
458 2018-04-08 22:38:58 Maybe market sentiments do matter in crypto.

472 2018-04-08 22:36:58 I think talking shit about poker projects around you just because you have a similar crypto project coming up is a little bit sad. Let me guess, you, Doug Polk, and maybe one more guy are going to do what Coin Poker did first 'cause they were smarter, yeah?

475 2018-04-08 22:36:32 Yeah I wouldn't mind if people did research, but just spamming their favorite links because they're pretty sure it should work and "crypto has no borders" is really annoying. Also aside from conversions just not enough sponsors use and donate to make it useful.

479 2018-04-08 22:36:14 Do people really care about privacy? 

When social media came up, vanity/privacy started a huge bull run.

Cambridge Analytica may have started a reversal for now but will it be enough?

Will people keep selling their privacy for comfort and vanity? It seems so.

518 2018-04-08 22:29:40 I think such news is a net positive, regardless of what their trading strategies are, as more institutional investors enter the space that will help it grow more over time and further solidify crypto assets as a viable asset class.
519 2018-04-08 22:29:18 Many TBC Members seem to be concerned about their incentive to share TBC and their reward to recruit new members into THEBILLIONCOIN community.

533 2018-04-08 22:26:06 Fools selling $NANO off the back of some bullshit Saul Goodman case. This Crypto world is mental sometimes. And it went up 2% since.
534 2018-04-08 22:26:01 instead of using all that processing power to mine crypto, why not use that to automate everything so everything becomes insanely cheap that you won't need money in the first place?
535 2018-04-08 22:25:58 Saw this tweeted somewhere yesterday. Perfect sentiment for the Bulls. Maybe not today, but it is inevitable. Lolz.

EAT SHIT, BEARS. THE SHIRTLESS CHADS ARE COMING.
536 2018-04-08 22:25:52 Gonna take more than a bull run this time I’m afraid. This time it’s gonna take this shit being useful. The folks with high risk tolerance are already aware and hodling. Next wave gonna be folks that see the purpose, and they’re gonna enter slowly, but there’s more of them.
537 2018-04-08 22:25:22 Sure. I apologize for making a random investment in XVG at $0.000029 in Feb 2017. Go back to your common sense routine. Thanks for the insight on the future of XVG and the 3 month chart 
538 2018-04-08 22:25:15 No... better that way. 
539 2018-04-08 22:24:17 Mine only accepts TRX... 
540 2018-04-08 22:24:00 This shakeout in the crypto field is common.  Anyone not in it for the long haul has sold at ridiculously low prices and hurt themselves. 
But as we know...it’s so hard to tell someone that they’re doing something wrong.  They need to learn it themselves.
541 2018-04-08 22:23:53 ICO advisor sounds scammy as hell.  Business people infiltrating crypto posing as advisors and experts -SMH. ICOs are already dead, they have no utility in a healthy decentralized economy.
542 2018-04-08 22:23:32 But does your grocery shop accept Bitcoin?

なんか、海外などでも同じようなことが起きてるって所まではわかったみたいですが、二回押しちゃった人がどうなるかという解決は、まだのようです。

562 2018-04-08 22:20:05 Beaucoup de youtubers, McAfee, les "priests" de Bcash et toutes les informations qui circulent dans les médias traditionnels, parfois pro, parfois anti-crypto. Surtout par manque d'expérience et quand on cherche à s'informer, on a tendance à croire tout et n'importe quoi.
563 2018-04-08 22:20:04 @cryptoSlate reports: "Major Class Action Lawsuit Filed Against NANO". Many ICOs focus on #SEC rules as the topic of the day, often forgetting the possibilities of private lawsuits over breaches in security or ignored regulations. #legal #crypto #blockchain

625 2018-04-08 22:08:44 That payment network is a big part of what makes crypto unique and special. Change the network for better or worse and you will have some users feel that the coin has been changed. The security model is changed, the UX is changed, the ledger is changed.

628 2018-04-08 22:08:09 Well then change your strategy and buy during major DIPS like -20%-68%. I think we’re at about -67.4% Total Crypto Market. Buy about 30% per position and wait for 2 more DIPS.
629 2018-04-08 22:07:45 will follow on this one ! nice to see ipfs finally used in a crypto project (or the first i see...)
630 2018-04-08 22:06:32 I think at the heart of the disagreement is if you consider the payment network as part of the definition of the coin. With fiat, the currency is very separate from the payment network. The very nature of crypto is that it has a built in payment network.
631 2018-04-08 22:06:17 ONT was pumping pretty good, so i switched it for VEN and ICX. I like to switch my overvalued coins that are pumping, for undervalued coins when i see an opportunity.

637 2018-04-08 22:05:00 If you're not getting what you want from crypto currently, it's likely not because you're not smart enough.

Remember what Charlie Munger said; "to get what you want, you have to deserve what you want."
638 2018-04-08 22:04:56 No probably not. But I made an investment over a year ago and it worked in my favor. I do like the technology of XVG which is why I’ve held on to it all this time...but we’ll see where it goes from here.

678 2018-04-08 21:57:53 Wasn't debt used as leverage for our extremely fast development in the last century? It's inequality that seems to bothers most people, specially when a Cartel controls the planet through such debt.

694 2018-04-08 21:54:36 To the crypto elite, hard forks are an ultimate protection against coercive behavior. To the casual crypto user, hard forks are a scary, confusing thing that represent unjustified coercive power. Blockchain governance is about successfully navigating this tension

709 2018-04-08 21:51:05 Why don’t we create own crypto social networking platform 
710 2018-04-08 21:50:37 Yes, but it's a factor. I do think that the Stock Market is playing a huge part. The World's economy is tied to the U.S. Stock Market. When the Crypto market crashed to $5900, the Stock Market was also crashing. When the Stock Market started dropping on March 21, so did cypto.

717 2018-04-08 21:48:26 Stuck with a few coins that dropped too low not worth getting rid of.. those will be the long term hold at least till they get near original value then move to the  coins 
718 2018-04-08 21:48:25 I agree to a degree for now.

For now, the $crypto space is too complex for regular Joe and Jane and its complexity might serve as a gatekeeper to let those in who can deal with it.

If we want it to become mainstream, we will have to have easy access to it at some point, though.

745 2018-04-08 21:43:11 But if decentralization is no longer a primary object of the crypto movement, then I can see why you would not be concerned (assuming you have enough fluency in the tech that you will be one of those in control).

And they wouldn't be 100% wrong, but most people in poverty don't have the time or resources to learn new tech. So if crypto is supposed to help decentralize wealth, I see that as an obstacle. 3/x

803 2018-04-08 21:33:12 The Crypto movement isn't as decentralized as you think!

I'm not sure how many of you out there on this forum are "miners", in the Crypto-space (Bitcoin etc) or even care--but this is important for tech in general. Like an open & free Internet. Think of Crypto as Wave 2.

817 2018-04-08 21:31:27 I get that just because of the triple double chevrons in my name. I can't help but feel they see "crypto-facists" everywhere, and only they can "see" it and "call it out" when its just based on their perception of a random comment some anon left under their account.
818 2018-04-08 21:31:27 I wonder how much the entry on $NANO will improve.. 50k possible?

833 2018-04-08 21:29:36 Adoption. Period. Some of you assume theres no window of opportunity for it. I worry it might have closed already.

835 2018-04-08 21:29:30 This is Nakamoto's dream--not a death sentence for the old institutions of power, but an escape out of their grasp for those who can see far enough. Crypto is the private key to the wallet of Freedom, but only a small few will have access.
836 2018-04-08 21:28:59 Really appreciated Will.

847 2018-04-08 21:27:02 @arunjaitley @RBI 
Please don't ban crypto currency (VCs)
If you want you can put high rate tax on it. But don't Ban it. Many people have put their hard money, rich people will nt have to make any difference but there will be a lot of damage to the normal traders.

851 2018-04-08 21:26:29 Right, good thinking. At current levels, 100k seems attainable.

I be checking $CPC every day for months now 
852 2018-04-08 21:26:26 Forget the coin tribes, crypto is far too correlated for that at the moment. The only group think is crypto itself. Until we see meaningful decorrelation within the space you're best off filtering out the tribe noise.
853 2018-04-08 21:26:19 Higher volume does not mean increase in price
854 2018-04-08 21:26:16 I'm glad that Mark Carney cleared the air last month and said that  the growing global army of #crypto crusaders are zero risk to their regime.   

He can't go back on his word, so when their system falls apart on itself, it will be interesting to hear his reasoning behind it. 
855 2018-04-08 21:26:06 There is a break through the trend line on the timeframe H4, trying to restore the price of $ 7000. Further, if we fix above $ 7000, then go to $ 8000, this is a complex zone, when you break through itvyou can already wait for a strong upward movement

870 2018-04-08 21:22:56 Do one that starts with Q and ends with N :)
871 2018-04-08 21:22:48 Not sure why people would give away good money to have some one draw charts for you. At the end of the day u just need to put the time in and learn. At the end of the day u'll get told to F'k off after paying for the privilege. Never paid for such groups - never will do.
872 2018-04-08 21:22:25 1. I've spent countless hours finding out how #bitcoin works. I also researched the best way to scale.

I'm in a crypto slack group where, to my surprise, I found some big blockers.

It's our jobs to help each other make more crypto, so I decided to try to convince them...
873 2018-04-08 21:22:01 @MithrilToken you need to set featured users who have more friends, not followers, or add the feature to delete friends 
874 2018-04-08 21:21:57 I like you already.

876 2018-04-08 21:21:44 Or a realisation of the real world utility in #xrp over other crypto. 

Although new money in will be required, smart money moving from other coins will also give the same result.
877 2018-04-08 21:21:43 Good move
878 2018-04-08 21:21:30 What are crypto facists anyway? People who scream "Heil Bitcoin!" ?
879 2018-04-08 21:21:29 true that

886 2018-04-08 21:19:42 Yup our universe could already be an AI simulation, and in our lifetimes we could experience a fractal reiteration of that on a smaller scale here on earth.

902 2018-04-08 21:16:02 That would be up to them, if they presented average information and not flat out lies I would be completely fine with it. There is no such thing as owning IP in crypto. Noone owns the bitcoin brand.
903 2018-04-08 21:15:58 Do they take crypto?
904 2018-04-08 21:15:52 Yes !!

905 2018-04-08 21:15:35 It was a joke.

Nice of you to stick up for him though.

I always thought he was bad for the space with the way he carried himself and represented #crypto.  But if people are lying about him that is slander because his reputation is definately taking a huge hit.
906 2018-04-08 21:15:23 HAHA It's great! @rogerkver is competing with @realDonaldTrump for the most hilarious twitter account.

944 2018-04-08 21:10:00 This has alot of important points to watch. Lots of case law can be made here. Most notably, the plaintiff is asking for nano to fork to repay owners who lost coins. If they rule yes then this can be used in the future. Should the gov be able to make u fork?  #decentralize

951 2018-04-08 21:08:34 Pay attention to what people r saying and try to do the opposite of the herd!
As we've seen people have lost interest on crypto.
The dumb money has lost interest!
Now people r calling for lower and lower prices.

952 2018-04-08 21:08:21 The crypto world ecosystem transfiguration has barely begun.

Significant BTC transactions are made silently away from exchanges by conservative institutions beyond any imagination.

BTC 100k is enevatable

954 2018-04-08 21:08:16 Wow. Crypto has had an interesting ride to get to this...

Remember folks, it’s about power and control and they constantly want it. 

Those elite families don’t want to compete with $BTC they want to dominate and own the whole crypto marketplace.

960 2018-04-08 21:07:11 Not laughing. Even 40 yrs ago the # of daily exchanges of value we're 1/10th of today's volume. I'm 100% sure something will replace dollars and euros when they fail. At present moment decentralized crypto seems obviously the next step.
961 2018-04-08 21:07:06 I actually guarantee it I’m only out of college and basically am all in crypto ha

Why so serious? "Crypto twitter" really needs a vacation.
966 2018-04-08 21:06:12 All assumptions in crypto are subject to the reality of empirical validation, not appeal to authority.
967 2018-04-08 21:06:00 The banks know that we know they are crooked and cstill exploit us with no concern. They have relished in the fact that they were recognized as too big to fail. They taunt us with undying relentlessness

974 2018-04-08 21:05:07 If there is one thing you whish you knew before you started with #crypto, what would it be? For me it is to not get attached to your crypto even if you believe in it’s future.

980 2018-04-08 21:04:37 Yes. 

BCH is better than any other token in crypto by virtue of having more empirical history than any other cash token in crypto.

Cryptocurrencies are empirically validated. Only bitcoin has been empirically validated since 2009.
981 2018-04-08 21:04:32 
982 2018-04-08 21:04:25 Accumulate or wait for a stronger market, those are the current options in the crypto world
983 2018-04-08 21:04:09 Also accept crypto for most services. 
984 2018-04-08 21:04:07 Nie trzeba sięgać aż po gry, w crypto też bawią się nastolatki, nieświadome konsekwencji jakie teraz są prezentowane. Myślę jednak, że gdy ktoś bawił się na zagranicznych giełdach raczej nie powinien tak bardzo panikować...

990 2018-04-08 21:03:28 No problem man. This is something real important to contemplate on. It's a good thread. Don't think enough people thinking about this. It's probably too late already, but the universe is full of mysterious things, who knows what else is around the corner to surprise us!
991 2018-04-08 21:03:19 If I remember correctly, ICO sold out Jan 15. BTC was $14k and ETH was over $1k, maybe $1200. This means Titanium has been at or above the performance of the rest of crypto at this price. Pretty impressive given hacks and the theft
992 2018-04-08 21:03:17 your project is needed by the crypto community, I think the first such store can repeat the fate of amazon or ebay.good luck.

1037 2018-04-08 20:57:32 one problem is that u cant easily cash out the token ; the total volume in the last 24 h is only 22 btc, if the likely scenario happens that a lot of people on your network want to sell 1 btc worth of your token well then most of them can not because your token is not liquid
1038 2018-04-08 20:56:56 Eric is a bellend, Philakone is a bellend but you ICO journal are fast becoming pond scum with this pointless bollocks. We are in a bear market all trying to help the industry and your contribution is this?? Fuck off

1058 2018-04-08 20:54:05 BCH is not the only peer to peer electronic cash in crypto, but it is the only peer to peer electronic cash with an unbroken transaction history back to the bitcoin genesis block in 2009.

Hence BCH is bitcoin.

BTC is unique in deciding not to be peer to peer electronic cash.

1070 2018-04-08 20:52:11 well theres analyists that are saying some people owe 25 billion worth in taxes due to crypto hype and trading, is just one of the cuases not all of them, thats why my first argument was mainstream people selling out.

1073 2018-04-08 20:52:05 Let me know how your wait goes.  Rumor is June of 2018 is when we can expect to hear about regulations.
1074 2018-04-08 20:51:55 Crypto needs to be fast and free of side-channels. Not a hard requirement, though.
1075 2018-04-08 20:51:46 True. If institutional investors are willing to invest in crypto such as Bitcoin Cash, then it could be good. But if they have ulterior motives to hijack BTC to have banks indefinitely trade back & forth on Lightning & push out miners & security, then it's not good.
1076 2018-04-08 20:51:40 What you want to type and what you actually type are two completely different things. JUST SIT THERE AND THINK BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING! PLEASE JUST USE YOUR BRAIN.

1081 2018-04-08 20:50:28 we need The Soros Coin, we pump and pump and pump then dump the whole thing to negative, the suckers will be shocked to realize their so called investment has turned into a liability. we collect millions going up, millions going down, millions behind 0
1082 2018-04-08 20:50:26 The tax reason pretty absurd.  Why wouldn't you just hold your BTC and not owe taxes? I get it people who trade with frequency might need to liquidate *some* crypto for the tax bill, but if you buy and hold you don't owe taxes on. I have no idea why this idea has so much traction

1092 2018-04-08 20:48:28 It is not freedom of expression, they are the terms and conditions of the use of the service. Tell us a decentralized "twitter", let's make these unfortunates feel that it feels to be free
1093 2018-04-08 20:48:25 I hope everyone is ready, at the end of summer I will be releasing info on my new crypto. It will not be an ICO it will be an airdrop combined with an old school ninja mining launch.
1094 2018-04-08 20:48:16 What goes up must come down, what goes down will eventually go back up. Markets have trends and these trends are amplified by volatility. For those invested in crypto, it has long been known that the volatility is extreme.  Also bull and bear trends flip with almost no warning.

1099 2018-04-08 20:47:42 One reason: Totally different market demographics.  I think too often people treat crypto like it's the stock/fx/bond markets, which have been well established for almost a century.  BTC is still finding its actual value. With no method for valuation it's all S/D + conjecture.

1126 2018-04-08 20:43:14 Unless use is simpler than Visa, LN doesn’t have a chance in markets; with online rqmts, + open and pre-funded channels LN has lost before it begins (outside of Nerdlandia.) It’s a waste driven by hodlers blindness.

1144 2018-04-08 20:40:38 It's not that difficult. Lack of economic freedom causes many harmful consequences. Bitcoin was supposed to help with economic freedom before being diverted to be a store of value for Western geeks.

1292 2018-04-08 20:17:03 No. USD holdings are one component  The demand also comes from crypto holders selling. Just because they sell crypto, doesnt mean they will cash out their Teth. Still could have a future as exch. stable coin. Seizure will verify fraud however.
1293 2018-04-08 20:16:49 Crypto like life is about maximizing the gifts of the season you find yourself in. In bull markets put in the extra hours to reap rewards. In the bear markets take extra time to disengage and refocus on what really matters in life.

I would short cryptos like mad. Create FUD, watch the price fall like a rock then load up.  Months later I would announce I’m getting into crypto, watch the FOMO happen, divest at the heights then create fear, and short.  It’s already happened folks. $btc
1327 2018-04-08 20:11:43 The real reason why bp was shutdown was the fact it was the largest exchange of guns on internet. Also all transactions for ads were done in crypto currencies.  The escort ads are all over the place now. It will be harder to trackdown kidnapped children.

1405 2018-04-08 20:01:42 Here's where we agree:

Here's where we don't: "Both are bitcoin."

The fact of the matter is they're distinct #crypto listings on exchanges with different names & ticker symbols.

It's misleading for one to market itself under the other's name.

1458 2018-04-08 19:55:08 Don't forget @OverstockCEO invested in #Ravencoin.  He's a really sharp guy so there must be something special about $RVN.
1459 2018-04-08 19:55:07 Nice, not sure if you are interested but I've been thinking it would be cool if there was a podcast that covers technical aspects of crypto life. Like, talks with devs, hardware specs (e.g. Trezor vs Ledgers) etc. You've got the tech chops, so just an idea :-)

1469 2018-04-08 19:54:33 Great explaintion of the Crypto world there, Frank... lol
1470 2018-04-08 19:54:30 I think most of the “crypto gurus” are a bunch of hacks preying on the ignorant, that being said there are some great guys in this space, the beautiful thing about this space is when we win we all win together. My opinion.
1471 2018-04-08 19:54:09 Lmao people be doing the most 
1472 2018-04-08 19:53:55 Ever looked into ECC? Definitely worth it in my opinion..
1473 2018-04-08 19:53:47 Coinseed thereby allows users to ef ortlessly invest in crypto while building adiversified portfolio of cryptocurrencies. #coinseed
1474 2018-04-08 19:53:47 I have followed BigCheds, EricChoe, Johnny Crypto & Philakone for awhile. They post a lot of good shit without asking for $. I dunno what this market manipulation crap is about. If this is true, why I am starting to make $ using their chart reading info? Reading my own charts?
1475 2018-04-08 19:53:46 I tried setting up @electroneum app on multiple old cell phones I have lying around.  Guess what? You need to validate with a cellphone number with active service. 
This method excludes millions of people from earning #crypto & is stifling adoption

Anyway around this?
1476 2018-04-08 19:53:29 Don’t trust trump with strategy he’s a good entertainer.  I like him for that
1477 2018-04-08 19:53:24 Crypto demands considerable knowledge of multiple domains though, right?
1478 2018-04-08 19:53:02 I said "less than 10 days..." 

??
1479 2018-04-08 19:52:37 
1480 2018-04-08 19:52:31 I don’t agree. They can’t even decide if it’s currency or property. But of course that’s only the elites way of making it difficult for the common people to invest in crypto.
1481 2018-04-08 19:52:28 Yeah mate forgot to take it off after the drag show
1482 2018-04-08 19:52:26 
1483 2018-04-08 19:52:24 My crypto investments might turn out to be a better hold of value in foreign assets then an short term investment for profit. Nifty.
1484 2018-04-08 19:52:22 Another crypto lesson I’ve learned. You either place your trades WAYYYY out of the money or close to the natural (as in last few hours) volatility. In between those is no mans zone. You won’t get filled unless something huge happens, which then it’ll blow right past your order
1485 2018-04-08 19:52:12 
1486 2018-04-08 19:51:54 I am looking at the charts on @binance and the 4 hour on #TRX has the Bollinger bands squeezing down and a lot of buy orders piling up.  Could break out here.  My attempt at TA

1491 2018-04-08 19:51:37 Thats true, I agree with most of it, thats how institutional investors make the common man lose money. I mean 'value' Because fiat currency itself looks like a big ponzi scheme to me, because banks lock in the already printed money for themselves, and use that to manipulate 
1492 2018-04-08 19:51:32 I really don't know how this crypto currency stuff works.. For like learn oh
1493 2018-04-08 19:51:29 it has really just been trending that 7000 for the last 2 days, few fake break downs and breakouts, all ended in a return to the 7000 line.
1494 2018-04-08 19:51:22 btw - bullish on blockchain and bearish on crypto
1495 2018-04-08 19:51:16 Why did you align yourself with him? Honest question. I love you stuff (& his too but im not a scalper so i don’t use his style). Just always seemed like strange bedfellows to me respectfully

1510 2018-04-08 19:49:16 No, that's not correct, either. Again, most software problems are due to buggy code, and (as I've often said in the past), "bad software trumps good crypto".

1523 2018-04-08 19:47:38 Exactly. I didn't know the #crypto Twitter was about revealing the personal information of the traders. If he was running some crypto related scams, then obviously people should be informed. But drugs? Who cares? The bear market probably made everyone really bored.

1528 2018-04-08 19:46:50 You must not understand how Crypto currencies work. When a block chain forks they are both still the original chain up to the point of the split. The Core fork followed an alternative path while the Cash fork was created to preserve the original path.

1552 2018-04-08 19:43:30 Same. I like RVN and ZIL, ONT also seems to have a VERY rich valuation especially in this bear market.

1559 2018-04-08 19:42:59 The best capital allocators in crypto have started with $10-25mm funds.

On the other hand, we’re giving software engineers 10-50x that much and expecting smart decisions. 

The malinvestment is just getting started.

1569 2018-04-08 19:41:45 Maybe for following certain account in the crypto space? 
1570 2018-04-08 19:41:26 Tbh this sounds like a catch 22. Who sounds more shady? The ico or the ico “advisor” who made $1m in nucleus vision advisory? Mcafee was also pulling his shit.

1585 2018-04-08 19:40:03 @crypto_sui There exists a path in the network that can transfer 12.58 BTC from one channel to another. Not sure how else to word it. Hope that makes sense. via @ArminVanBitcoin #CryptopiaPress #Crypto

1591 2018-04-08 19:39:26 Guys let's all report this f***n page. This has nothing to do with crypto or his TA. This has to stop. NOW. I already reported them.
1592 2018-04-08 19:39:24 I'm not saying he doesn't work what I'm saying is he never gives us Intel because the only thing on his Twitter timeline is fucking crypto shit
1593 2018-04-08 19:38:56 he never ran or charged for a paid group. he never charged a group of people to give them trading calls. everyone keeps misunderstanding that. it was a ONE person MENTORSHIP from @BigCheds @AltOne_Crypto @CryptoChoe. not just him either. well worth it for someone wealthy imo
1594 2018-04-08 19:38:49 Cryptocurrency is not a trend or something to just speculate with,
It is the conviction that someday, we will escape from the elite control

1595 2018-04-08 19:38:48 It’s a marriage of convenience and can result in a messy divorce.  It’s a race to the bottom and a reverse auction!

1598 2018-04-08 19:38:23 Good question. I think part of my call stems from observation that many crypto enthusiasts are libertarians enthusiastic about the potential of weakening nation states through uncensorable currency. What are the potential ethical repercussions of such developments?
1599 2018-04-08 19:38:07 It is possible that all the crypto folk will get banned off twitter just like we got banned out of ads and mailchimp. They won't ask.

1608 2018-04-08 19:37:23 Hold up. Arc works when he's at work and crypto is a hobby. He's not the only dev working on Z1, it takes a team. I did level design back in the day and it can take 15-20 people 6-8 months to make a map, never mind one the size of Z1. Arc busts his ass, don't sell him short.

1612 2018-04-08 19:36:29 Interesting you mentioned that. #crypto super-hypes now the value of IQ (coding, game and economic theory, mechanism design etc.). History has shown the 'soft side' pushes changes. IQ for sure helps create stuff, EQ moves the needle!

1619 2018-04-08 19:35:32 Could even get deeper then with the same pattern again or / and acccumulate slowly going sideways and then up. Looks very exciting right now.

1621 2018-04-08 19:35:21 can't avoid taxes , your goin to get hit at crypto atm's or exchange conversions 
1622 2018-04-08 19:35:20 good time for expanding crypto and aelf
1623 2018-04-08 19:35:19 suppressing the freedom to express ones self (unless there's intent to cause physical harm) is never acceptable. Anyone who thinks this ban is ok cause they dont like Roger Ver should leave bitcoin/crypto cause your clearly here for the wrong reasons. Bans are antibitcoin..
1624 2018-04-08 19:35:17 And since they arent going anywhere id rather have my money on a digital asset that actually has a chance  to prosper. As we can see from recent events, decentralized anti banks anti government cryptos can be smashed to zero if the banks & governments wish so. Rather play safe

1630 2018-04-08 19:33:55 @SenStabenow Senator with regards to a proposed $10.00 fee per Kayak and Canoe and Paddleboat. This is non-sense! It is non-motorized and a farce for us residents. There are not enough DNR Police nor Sherriffs available to patrol our lakes as it is. This is just a money grab!
1631 2018-04-08 19:33:54 Like mafia of crypto. Cept the hacked @daytradernik and @Hotkatchina . :(
1632 2018-04-08 19:33:42 I kind of agree with you, seems like it's working on so many different things, made it rather difficult to digest the contents
1633 2018-04-08 19:33:35 Exactly. And XRP isn’t that coin to do that job either
1634 2018-04-08 19:33:30 @TheSGB @zeldalinklover1 @CreepyElliot 
out of all the things to scare me in the latest L.A Noire episode, f***ing Thomas the tank engine?!
1635 2018-04-08 19:33:03 By the way i dont really hate xrp. Its solving a real problem unlike 90% of other cryptos. Some may not like it because its working with banks & governments but i live in the real world & in the real world banks & governments arent going anywere..
1636 2018-04-08 19:32:56 The pattern right now copies excactly the same pattern before the 6k bottom. That‘s why I‘m expecting the same bounce type of bottom but just weaker because the patterns repeats while getting smaller and smaller.
1637 2018-04-08 19:32:44 I’m not sure Apple allows native key signing for crypto transactions - would love to see any examples that exist.  And more to your point, without key import/export  functionality can’t recover wallets from lost phones.  Basically useless
1638 2018-04-08 19:32:32 Yay. This is awesome. All the best Cherie, you're truly a great representation of women in this crypto space & I hope you inspire more women to be involved.

1644 2018-04-08 19:31:54 Hope this is a true representation of things to come for @litecoin @SatoshiLite if there was ever a way to get the message out to new young blood in crypto, This is it, Bring on the billboards!! #GraphicDesign #litecoin @recon_Jake

1646 2018-04-08 19:31:33 I understand all the people who are afraid of getting into crypto world. An answer like that would be unacceptable in "real" world.

1667 2018-04-08 19:28:43 Ont = Buzzword soup. No substance. Basically saying we're building a platform on top of another platform. At this point people who build platforms really have no original ideas, just want to make money off other peoples ideas.

1691 2018-04-08 19:25:41 Don't buy @nanocurrency it's the biggest scam in whole #Crypto after @BitGrail
#nano it's scam!!
1692 2018-04-08 19:25:37 reading back, you’ve *never* had anything concrete to say on BTC/crypto. (“FUD FUD FUD FUD” isn’t a constructive criticism.) The most concrete thing you have done here is complain in detail to @askdepop because someone wasn’t nice. Know your lane, I guess.
1693 2018-04-08 19:25:36 @myCryptoHippo would you be interested in running a workshop for Generation Z at first US based women only hackathon June 4, NYC hosted @Women4blockcha1 @crypto_chicks
1694 2018-04-08 19:25:31 To be a reckless 20 something again
1695 2018-04-08 19:25:24 That's what.... I was also feeling the same. This "suppression" is artificial. They can't really control something having such a transparent system like this. Its just a matter of time before people realise how they are manipulating prices. We all may need more awareness. ;)
1696 2018-04-08 19:25:21 Capture the Flag (CTF) is a special kind of information securitycompetitions. There are three common types of CTFs: Jeopardy, Attack-Defence and mixed. Jeopardy-style CTFs has a couple of questions (tasks) in range of categories. For example, Web, Forensic, Crypto, Binary.
1697 2018-04-08 19:25:19 Her seyi bilemeyiz onemli olan ogrenmek ve kapris yapmamaktir. Anadan dogarken kripto paralar yoktu.  Emeginize elinize saglik
1698 2018-04-08 19:25:03 so if someone takes @PhiIakoneCryqto side he is being paid by him. His TA is one of the best in whole crypto community, don't know why some hates him
1699 2018-04-08 19:25:03 I'll take the other side. 

Communities, when it comes to crypto, form around a value proposition or incentive structure.

If, that begins to ebb away, or too much rent extraction occurs, the community itself becomes the driver and forks. The software plays catch-up.

1712 2018-04-08 19:23:27 I believe they are here in an attempt to tame and absorb if not destroy crypto before it takes real foothold and becomes a treath to global financial elite. If the cypto world can not grow out of bag shilling and juvenile arguements and deliver real use cases it will get corrupt

1738 2018-04-08 19:20:10 ...to a hypothetical situation, where, lets assume 1 billion people hold a total of all bitcoins available. Now how can those cartels, without touching bitcoins reduce the value of them? 
Because no one knows the actual supply of gold, so it can be manipulated by them.

1748 2018-04-08 19:18:49 Peter, I don't agree that only a few will exist.  While I do realize many of these will not last, I see #crypto playing out differently than OS and the internet as we now know it. Primarily because these companies don't solely depend on pure profits as do the ones aforementioned.

1843 2018-04-08 19:09:35 Not in democratized countries... Hopefully. Russia definetly sees crypto as just another way to control the masses.

1846 2018-04-08 19:09:11 TraXion is building a crypto-economy to last, therefore, the focus will be on the scale, elimination of middlemen, and decentralizing legacy systems.

1850 2018-04-08 19:08:32 A recurring advice in books written by great investors/traders is keeping emotions out of it. The fanboy culture in crypto is ridiculous.

1981 2018-04-08 18:54:43 Put it this way, we'd need evidence to conclude Robinhood wiped out higher fee crypto brokers before arguing it will trounce a like-minded competitor. BP, Shell, Texaco do the same effing thing. Sometimes I see 3 nearly identical competitors at one intersection, in 2018
1982 2018-04-08 18:54:26 The crypto Market is unregulated and the big money makes too much money and are having too much fun for them to completely crash this Market.$100 increase and Bitcoin makes them hundreds of millions of dollars.

I’ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. —Maya Angelou

#VergeFam - there's a lot of new people coming into crypto because of #XVG. They'll have new questions.
2124 2018-04-08 18:42:17 Spent a whole day away from crypto & Twitter today to concentrate on family, friends and me time. It's important to fill your bags with more than low mcap alts. Invest time in yourself and your relationships and you will achieve everything you need in life $BTC

2126 2018-04-08 18:42:04 Why do ppl post shyte that is obviously factually wrong???  For example, the world is flat. Obviously wrong there a FCKING picture of it being round.  It’s like my biggest fear.  Totally missing the facts of something.  FCKING makes me crazy nuclear when ppl do that in crypto.

2133 2018-04-08 18:41:19 Cryptocurrency ethics is an extremely important but underserved field. If the financial systems of our future run on crypto-systems, lack of thought about diversity and inclusion and fairness now will propagate the cycle of economic disparity.
2134 2018-04-08 18:41:17 That's why you watch the SATS and not the dollar value. If you buy at 500sats $.04 and now its at 570sats but still at $.04. You've technically made a profit. This will make your crypto life a little easier if you look at it that way
2135 2018-04-08 18:41:14 when Periscope, simon?
2136 2018-04-08 18:41:13 Poker does not rly benefit from blockchain technology imo

2152 2018-04-08 18:39:52 I never thought about it till just now. The US dollar is one of the most counterfeited currencies in the world. Cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology could fix this. I'm not promoting state backed crypto, just pointing out another benefit crypto has to offer the world.
2153 2018-04-08 18:39:50 I mean, that is fine. But, a "deed" still has powerful implications.  In the case of crypto, this "deed" would be used for small purchases instead of large ones.
2154 2018-04-08 18:39:47 @Vultr Very unhappy with vultr so far. DNS down for hours last weekend and now host node down, server and site unresponsive. No ETA, no information on status page. Will take my business elsewhere if this keeps going.

2156 2018-04-08 18:39:44 #moneto The vast majority of the ICO projects, launching a bounty program. What is the bounty program? #crypto #eth #btc
2157 2018-04-08 18:39:34 I agree! @TheICOJournal needs to butt out. Anyone who wants to be taken serious in this space needs to stay professional and do what’s right for #Crypto

2170 2018-04-08 18:37:30 We did bro. They went all in on 20 just sold the 6k dip
2171 2018-04-08 18:37:20 The developers have already engaged in one project, which brought me a lot of profit. That's why I'm going to invest in this one, too. Join now @ntok_io #NTOK
2172 2018-04-08 18:37:12 Fck u, No!
2173 2018-04-08 18:37:03 And yet you follow Blockstream? You never answered my question. Do you want crypto to be adopted worldwide?
2174 2018-04-08 18:36:47 OP is ridiculous. This isn’t due to NANO tech, it was the exchange. If the courts force a hard fork then this will be bad for all of crypto, not just NANO.

2177 2018-04-08 18:36:22 I have a great time explaining crypto to performers on SpankChain shows that are new to crypto. They really love the ideas.
2178 2018-04-08 18:36:18 I like what you did there
2179 2018-04-08 18:36:09 Honestly clif, you are so behind the curve, everyone who is "anyone" figured that out years ago. It was instantly seized by the NSA/US patent office. Just pulling your chain a bit. Good to see your mind is still voraciously active. When is new CRYPTO report coming? Thanks
2180 2018-04-08 18:35:39 Ehh, might not have enough time. Gonna be playing some disc golf today and need to give @AstronautSarah my attention, lest she sells me for some Litecoin
2181 2018-04-08 18:35:37 Just let it go fellas. Once the conversation turns toxic, it prevents you form properly representing your position from a position of kindness and patience. 

Agree to disagree and let's move on.
2182 2018-04-08 18:35:37 But when your alter ego takes over twitter it’s not classified as hacked
2183 2018-04-08 18:35:25 In South Africa Krugerrands are legal tender thus not taxed. Best value for money here if u into crypto
2184 2018-04-08 18:35:17 Damn 
2185 2018-04-08 18:35:13 If soros went all in on anything in crypto it would destroy the market. Hes worth more than 8 billion
2186 2018-04-08 18:35:13 Proof crypto people only care about money, thats why I support Bcash
2187 2018-04-08 18:35:08 I hope it turns out that way. I am not a #verge holder but mass adoption in #crytpo is good for the whole ecosystem. On the contrary, a let down can hurt the whole crypto-shpere too. Good luck for the April 17th !!
2188 2018-04-08 18:35:00 Pinch yourself and wake up
2189 2018-04-08 18:34:58 Which signs were so obvious? I didn’t see him crying out for help online.
2190 2018-04-08 18:34:56 They really need to fix this it's a nightmare and its likely to keep people away from crypto.
2191 2018-04-08 18:34:54 L’analyse technique sur la crypto monnaie ça sert pas à grand chose non ?
2192 2018-04-08 18:34:43 Must be because of the transaction volume now that Cryptopia’s wallet is working #ETN #crypto
2193 2018-04-08 18:34:32 hahahah okay thanks
2194 2018-04-08 18:34:22 ASIC resistant forks will force hardware companies to upgrade faster and speed up production cycles, in turn, forcing crypto devs to be actively involved in projects or get slaughtered by ASIC hardware

2201 2018-04-08 18:33:41 Fawk.. I was looking forward to your return. Learning lots from your videos, but far from done watching! Just want to say thank you for your contributions to the crypto community!
2202 2018-04-08 18:33:37 If you think that passing a law will make an immutable ledger mutate you must be an idiot. If you think there's a "controller" for crypto, you must be an idiot. If you think the GDPR matters, you must be an idiot. Regulations don't work on Distributed ledgers.
2203 2018-04-08 18:33:29 I think crypto currency has a lot of potential. But people need to start earning it and creating the circular economy. I don't see the same potential for contrived scarcity schemes in the form of securitized 'tokens'.
2204 2018-04-08 18:33:28 I support crypto
2205 2018-04-08 18:33:27 Today’s episode of Crypto TA Special Victim Unit is good.

2206 2018-04-08 18:33:17 It's good to be prudent and cautious, I commend you taking the time to explain that to people. Get them thinking about safeguarding themselves.

I assure you however, and anyone who's been following me since the beginning knows, this isn't hype brother, this is pure excitement!

2213 2018-04-08 18:32:17 People think Crypto is nothing but currencies.

Which is false. Actual company's helping with real world problems...

2225 2018-04-08 18:31:13 The symmetries with dotcom extend beyond the charts.

Good idea, world changing, but a prototype that needs ten years (maybe less this time) of patient incremental work to deliver on the promise.

The true crypto revolution will deliver a new decentralized internet in the 2020s.
2226 2018-04-08 18:31:10 This is not my assumption. It’s all been right here on Twitter. I’ve read all of his tweets for months. TA is my favorite pastime and he’s taught me more than anyone else. I have nothing but respect for him. DM me if you want to talk more about this offline

2247 2018-04-08 18:29:45 The line in London is if you mention blockchain and crypto you're halfway to getting funded. Having been a CTO for hire previously it's interesting when you start to dig into things like business plans and experience though. Often (not always though) a punt
2248 2018-04-08 18:29:20 His Twitter is hacked dude.
2249 2018-04-08 18:29:18 Like how did you not educate your self on security while getting into crypto. Like hmmm exchanges get hacked and they I’m sure they security serious. But let me not get a vpn a proxy 2fa call my cellphone provider and tell them only deal with me in person and all the other steps
2250 2018-04-08 18:29:16 Sci fi horror story outline:

There's no way to ban them.

Is the IRS listening?
2255 2018-04-08 18:27:56 tell me more
2256 2018-04-08 18:27:30 Yessir, but many new investors and even veterans are lax for whatever reason in security. I’d say most are less educated on security than the crypto market itself  I abide by the same rules, especially never WiFi.
2257 2018-04-08 18:27:18 Regulation is luring the family office and institutional crowds into the crypto space.
2258 2018-04-08 18:27:16 Currently the optional privacy aspect is superior because you get the best of both worlds and you get to decide. Additionally, once RSK is ready and coded onto the Verge blockchain, TPS will increase to 2000.  But the key features of $XVG are privacy and this coming partnership.
2259 2018-04-08 18:26:50 The problem is none of us will really know for sure which side is “right” in this social media world. Sad both ways though

2267 2018-04-08 18:25:46 I can elaborate.  Feel free to shoot me a DM,  The fact is that ProjectPOMA and HTML are still working hand in hand to bring amazing projects to the crypto communities.  The evidence is there for all to see.  Hopefully you will see it as well!
2268 2018-04-08 18:25:45 I like crypto ;)
2269 2018-04-08 18:25:44 i see ur point for sure.
2270 2018-04-08 18:25:39 This is correct. I've been trading crypto and holding crypto since 2014 and the best returns come when I turn off TA and just left FA+basic sentiment take over.
2271 2018-04-08 18:25:26 Call the FBI dead serious
2272 2018-04-08 18:25:14 The guy has done more for crypto IRL than most keyboard warriors on twitter.
2273 2018-04-08 18:25:07 It could be 3$ 30$ or 300$
2274 2018-04-08 18:24:56 What u think about @AltOne_Crypto and @LamboLeon ?
2275 2018-04-08 18:24:53 My crypto specific channel avg view duration is much higher and I put in about 10% the amount of effort for that channel. And the ad rev will be like 4-5x higher. #facepalm
2276 2018-04-08 18:24:51 What does it mean if I'm mostly served ads for what appears to be a crypto-currency scam?
2277 2018-04-08 18:24:42 Me too
2278 2018-04-08 18:24:32 Make registration possible for +375 numbers 
2279 2018-04-08 18:24:26 Banks will probably use their own version of $xrp , and $xrp does not necessarily reflect how well the ripple company does. One of the several reasons I dislike it.
2280 2018-04-08 18:24:19 Got to appreciate all the twitter TA and FA in #crypto, but it makes you think if #AI is taking advantage of the data better than humans can.

2287 2018-04-08 18:23:35 Back in 2016, the SEC buried any hope that a bitcoin ETF would come to the market. Now, it seems that SEC is prepared to revisit the idea of a bitcoin ETF, which would make it way easier for investors to gain exposure to BTC.

2304 2018-04-08 18:20:45 This is silly. We all miss the adrenaline rush of a bull run but trying to recreate that with a shitty hacker in the crypto world plot is boring.
That’s a straight to DVD script
2305 2018-04-08 18:20:31 It wont stop people. They buy crypto from people from other countries who can still buy...they just shooting themselves in the foot. Crypto is the future and they are pissing themselves with fear.
2306 2018-04-08 18:20:28 Already on @binance ,already a great sidechain, so when more volume comes in.....this will fly,also look at the fundamental of governance,this will be big for $POA and crypto in general. Plus the addition of other exchanges will organically bring more volume.  X10, X50 if patient

2317 2018-04-08 18:19:13 Fun fact. As banks and the legacy euro financial system continues to try and trangle crypto on ramps and off ramps. They will drive that demand to Russia, Asia, #Bitcoin mining hardware, gpus, feed its security model and embolden the east as financial leaders for generations.
2318 2018-04-08 18:19:05 Are you guys actually aware of what’s really going to happen lol. This is crypto . We had days when coins were pulling 100-200% in a day when they were HIGHER than they are now . Recovery won’t be hard at all when everyone starts buying in again.

2332 2018-04-08 18:18:27 Also I thought Johnny has been acting way different and “off” lately. Just didn’t seem like the same old Johnny, which made me think something weird was going on. What’s up? What are they doing??

2355 2018-04-08 18:16:09 I think maybe the solution lies in crypto. A robust titanium chastity device that only unlocks upon solving an increasingly complex equation which is checked against the domme's electronic ledger. "cockblockchain," if you will.
2356 2018-04-08 18:16:05 Oh my gosh what a nightmare! I'm sorry this happened to you. I've learned a lot from your live streams and you've helped to educate a lot of people about crypto. It's a pity :(

crypto OG's understand the difference between $xrp and Ripple
2409 2018-04-08 18:08:58 yeah, I'm honestly not worried about it because I'm not super serious about crypto currency it's just kind of annoying because I can't mine even close to what I should be
2410 2018-04-08 18:08:56 Philakone, please listen to me.  Take time off.  Sleep on it and try to discuss this with them - if you know who they are.  Dont get into a worse situation.  We will all wait, besides we follow lots of ????.  This is a serious situation that can only get WORSE if you let it out!

2428 2018-04-08 18:07:14 When I started investing in crypto I came to know abt pumps and signals telegram groups !! Experience was worst paid 200$ for a month , they use to give signals which were already pumped , so started learning it myself , left the group happy to take the risk my way now !!
2429 2018-04-08 18:07:12 and why would a hacker do it for 10K when he can take half a million apparently !

2511 2018-04-08 18:01:09 One thing that bothers me about crypto are the private sales. Cryptos were supposed to eliminate the 1% owning all the wealth. Private sales only cater to rich people, how is this the vision of Satoshi Nakamoto and those who want to move away from the 1% owning the wealth?
2512 2018-04-08 18:01:08 Cool, and I was simply continuing a conversation; thanks for being rude though. Take care.

3) concentrate on the positives of DGB
2518 2018-04-08 18:00:48 I think it will, it might not be BTC but crypto currency will be taken as currency, not all coins by any means but there is a reason why some countries are already thinking of it as a national digital currency. 
it will happen, just a matter of when.
it’s evolution...
2519 2018-04-08 18:00:42 [Huobi Market] On April 5, 2018, #Japan’s #Business Research Group drafted a proposal requesting that the government regulate #ICOs in a non-draconian way that would protect investors’ interests and encourage the growth of the nascent #ICO industry. #crypto #cryptocurrencies

1hRSIのリバだと100$とか普通に動くし、動く方向当たって乗ってても、その部分逃すと結局利益が100$幅だったなんてことが多い。

2544 2018-04-08 17:58:35 why are ind gov banning crypto currency, if we ban it our country will not develop like other countries, we need crypto revolution to grow our country in 100x speed. other countries are 100 year forward than us because they adopt new technologies, and we indians ban them #crypto

2547 2018-04-08 17:58:20 In no era, a currency was deceloped and maintaned under trust issues. 
People themselves feel good when they touch the values they work all day. Its a satisfactionary station.
Crypto its a ponzi. Maybe pump and dump. Maybe good. But never eloquent.

2563 2018-04-08 17:56:24 Watch out for privacy coins. First crypto to be banned will be privacy coins. They are the antithesis to lawfulness. They dont have the thousands of years of history and mindshare that hard cash has. Govr can easily ban fiat gateways and merchants. $XMR $ZCH $ZCL $BTCP

2568 2018-04-08 17:55:55 My vote was based on my concern that the persons presence / presentation may scare off people who would ordinarily have an open mind about it.  Crypto already has a shady/questionable reputation,  we have to choose/promote the ambassadors judiciously.
2569 2018-04-08 17:55:48 Wonderful!!
2570 2018-04-08 17:55:42 Very important persons, it is very joyful to realize that the crypto currency is promoted and developed at the highest level, those people who occupy high positions in the field of finance!
2571 2018-04-08 17:55:32 Maybe not. But there seems to be a wider purge ongoing against crypto on social media platforms. Wouldn't surprise me if this was an opening shot against many more accounts.

2590 2018-04-08 17:53:46 I’m lining up my #altcoin portfolio for the upcoming bull run. Give it 6 weeks and it will be #crypto #cryptocurrency summer - the frost is thawing guys
2591 2018-04-08 17:53:24 Crypto is for kids hoping to see the moon.  XRP is for adults that do business on Earth.
2592 2018-04-08 17:53:24 It was not a 51% attack but a mining time stamp exploit which has been fixed in record time. Big coins will always remain a target for attackers but the most important thing is the ability of the team to withstand those attack. #verge showed how it’s done

2598 2018-04-08 17:52:39 There is a lot of drama going on right now in Crypto Twitter world

2672 2018-04-08 17:43:55 crypto to fiat is banned in india, this is just fud !
2673 2018-04-08 17:43:43 Good point. It is the private key that stores the crypto. Like a ledger of the time, date and amount! The private key uses cryptography.
2674 2018-04-08 17:43:42 Makes sense; I haven't put new fiat in for months. Not into losing in these bearish shenanigans
2675 2018-04-08 17:43:40 Most ppl are controlled by fear... in crypto we have Fud and Fomo. Both are fears. Why not to act from dreams and desires instead from fear? A paradigm changing is needed. A new educational model is required.

2681 2018-04-08 17:43:28 are you against crypto ?
2682 2018-04-08 17:43:25 Bullish on bearish $BTC $CRYPTO
2683 2018-04-08 17:43:22 If we can get immutability and decentralised data storage without the heavy duty blockchain models, crypto would be much bigger than even the bulls imagine.  Facebook and counts of data breaches show the need for decentralisation.  Think we will get there sooner than most think.
2684 2018-04-08 17:42:50 The technology is here to stay, but the idea of using crypto as a currency is a fad imo. How can you use something which swings 10% plus daily as a financial instrument? Unless the volatility decreases significantly, it’ll disappear.
2685 2018-04-08 17:42:44 RBI cann't dictate where I invest my hard earned money. Crypto investors are providing their aadhar, pan and bank account information as mandated by RBI to open account with the exchanges. They even pay high taxes @30% and then u ban it.

The fact that he runs one of the largest co's in crypto.

2711 2018-04-08 17:38:45 @Cointana
2712 2018-04-08 17:38:29 For now, main obstruction of accepting $crypto as form of payment by corp is price volatility. It's advantages are obvious. But there's no way to keep the value in crypto and avoid being taking over by competitors.
2713 2018-04-08 17:38:25 Also, I dont even follow the guy and trolled him pretty hard for this already, so I'm not biased. He's kind of a dick tbh, but he paid his due the first time he got hacked. You guys are laughing at the very reason why crypto is not mainstream. This shit aint secure.

2715 2018-04-08 17:38:16 Anyone who claims to have consistently accurate "predictions" of anything crypto should either get a dictionary or be ignored. They're no better than crystal ball readers/fortune tellers. I cringe each time I hear that word.

2720 2018-04-08 17:37:51 If you’re in #crypto and you’re adding “Fam” to coin names, you’re easily part of the problem and why industries, financial institutions and people don’t take us seriously

@amazon is not going to use a #cryptocurrency because you add FAM to it

E.g. #BitconnectFam #BCashFam etc.

2722 2018-04-08 17:37:27 A plus point for a cryptocurrency for real mass adoption is the stability of the currency itself. In long term, if #bitcoin is the new #gold could #xrp be the new #usd in #crypto #finance? Waiting for your #ideas!

2754 2018-04-08 17:33:49 Yes $neo is pretty much trash, it is centralised, has high barriers to entry and the neo token is not actually even used in the network. If you love the neo protocol you should buy gas, but you should probably put your neo into eth/xlm/eos/drgn instead. Probably in that order.

2821 2018-04-08 17:24:12 One more thing I forgot to mention:

Don't ship a userspace CSPRNG, like ISAAC. Every modern browser ships a CSPRNG via the Web Crypto API with window.crypto.getRandomValues().

Unless you know you need to support a browser that doesn't support it, use the Web Crypto API.

There are 3 months left before banks cut off infrastructure for crypto exchanges.  In the interim, what is your plan of action?

Investing into ICOs and tokenized AC & VC leverages the performance of our funds compared to regular ryptocurrency investments by far. Typically, higher return means higher risk (of loss).

3071 2018-04-08 16:57:39 Those are serious allegations man.
3072 2018-04-08 16:57:32 Article implies Soros getting directly involved (actual assets) not indirectly (i.e "crypto stock" ETF). When actual crypto ETFs (holding actual crypto assets) happens it'll be a major upside catalyst, but need custody figured out before we can get an ETF approved.

3075 2018-04-08 16:56:44 Then how is any money to be made with your advertised "minimum investment of $5" plus your fees.
People that know nothing about investing only putting about $10 to $20 into this app aren't going to see any sort of significant returns. 
And Tbh, #Crypto is a better option.

3198 2018-04-08 16:41:20 Both the expressed & implied advertising claim of tweets like "#bitcoincash is #bitcoin" are misleading. Consumers may purchase the former yet think that they own the latter. It doesn't work that way. They are distinct #crypto offerings on exchanges & should be addressed as such.

3202 2018-04-08 16:40:53 You got something wrong here dude. He was just talking about debts in general. And debts are never good as long if you don’t take a credit for a wise longterm investment. And even that is related to risks. @Super_Crypto is actually bullish on crypto.

3244 2018-04-08 16:34:09 Nothing wrong with investing in crypto but if it ever makes it $300k a coin it's for very different reasons than an actual living business would, and it would most likely be over more hype than real reason....which is a dangerous way to raise value
3245 2018-04-08 16:34:09 Biggest bubble of 2018? The subscription boxes companies are selling I can’t see them lasting long term. There will be a few companies that do this well and the rest will go bankrupt

3247 2018-04-08 16:33:39 I would imagine they have already been in crypto for a little while and are only publicly announcing it now. Investors of this stature do not report their moves beforehand so as not to give the market a chance to change their entry conditions. Big news regardless!

3258 2018-04-08 16:31:36 You‘re on the extreme end of the spectrum from what I saw from all channels on my platform. But I can definitely see that your crypto topic is naturally one that’s more about non-subs than subs. I don‘t know much about your niche but it‘s quite hype and search driven, right?
3259 2018-04-08 16:31:20 funny thing with crypto-critics is that they will wait 20 years for bitcoin to fail just so they can say "i told you so". 

how is that in anyway productive. 

the problem with journalism and this culture of opinion pieces is, no real insight or solutions.

3292 2018-04-08 16:27:56 Sponsored article to make you give ouy your email and probably get you to pay for some sort of service scheme. Nicely done but crypto will own those markets in the upcoming years watch and learn.
3293 2018-04-08 16:27:49 it does have the good effect of turning the stupidest of us away from crypto. After they fool for this and lose $, they'll never come back. I can't complain about that.

3330 2018-04-08 16:21:16 @desh_saurabh crypto currency involves investment of over 50lakh Indians, involves the KYC process and generates taxes worth 300 crores for the govt. Trying to block such transparent process is beyond me

3334 2018-04-08 16:21:04 Anonymity is a very important part of the crypto industry. But more importantly - the speed of the transaction. The Sonder is designed to solve all these problems. Around the third quarter of 2018, they plan to release an alpha version of their wallet.

3392 2018-04-06 23:55:58 $gin was the first Masternode I ever set up and it’s because of you that I started looking into diversifying into some passive income in crypto! Super easy too

3415 2018-04-06 23:53:13 My prediction is that $BTC will be at $6,600 forever.  I’m basing this on thorough TA using the 15 minute chart.  #crypto #bitcoin

3418 2018-04-06 23:52:51 So Backpage switched to crypto only for payments, everyone bought account credits with bitcoin, and now the site's been shut down. Stealing a last bit of money from hookers who are going to struggle to work.

3420 2018-04-06 23:52:38 2 things:

1: you stay in crypto (don’t cash out) there is NO tax event. So you don’t have to file anything. Ask anyone or your CPA they will confirm

2. If you cash out and there is a profit, yes you pay tax on that
3421 2018-04-06 23:52:36 The #Spanish Tax Agency (AEAT) has sent information requests for customer data to 60 companies associated with #cryptocurrencies, including financial firms, intermediaries like #crypto exchanges and ATMs, and companies that accept crypto as a payment option.

3451 2018-04-06 23:48:01 One of the key problems we have today is that the crypto space is so toxic.

Good people don’t go into other people's post, and start stating "their facts."

3467 2018-04-06 23:44:35 Está turbulento el tema crypto currencies. Pero si, una ficha ahí. Es el futuro, pero falta un poco.
3468 2018-04-06 23:44:30 Shoulda held out for that $32
3469 2018-04-06 23:44:25 A lot of these so called chart experts eat their words all the time and they still preach inaccurate information, quit that shit if it’s your day job. That’s insanity. #Crypto

3471 2018-04-06 23:43:52 Ultimately the point is to not cash out bc if you cash out to ur bank then the gov can seize it. If you stay in crypto then you don’t have that risk. You are securing your funds from seizure
3472 2018-04-06 23:43:51 bot抗争のおかげでFX触るのが面倒になってきたので、落ち着くまではファンダ売買してましょうかね…
3473 2018-04-06 23:43:32 I remember a lot of people saying wallstreet would be good, futures would be good, now soros will ve good... just take a look at the graphics and see what’s happening to $BTC price since futures oficial entry...
3474 2018-04-06 23:43:24 Good healthy numbers too 
3475 2018-04-06 23:43:16 What’s wrong with that statement? He’s not a financial advisor...
3476 2018-04-06 23:42:43 Institutional money was forecasted to enter the market.  Asians are buying in now, and as more money enters I believe this will help facilitate the beginning of a new bull market.
3477 2018-04-06 23:42:41 Bulls aren't giving up

3501 2018-04-06 23:37:59 I don’t care about the price because I understand the game/market. I’m just riding this Crypto wave.
3502 2018-04-06 23:37:53 feels like the bulls won’t let crypto go down and the bears are out of ammo...crypto stalemate.
3503 2018-04-06 23:37:40 If I were anybody I’d sell any Crypto as this is a huge con job and now Soros is rumored to be a part of it.  DO NOT give your money to a computer.  #Fraud #Soros

3505 2018-04-06 23:37:37 I thought that crypto currency was getting capital gains tax treatment (i.e. that gains and losses are pretty meaningless unless cashed out, traded, or otherwise converted). If true, most who gained and now lost won’t owe.

Who benefits from a Crypto-currency that is traded on an “Exchange?”  

The people that own the “Exchange” is the correct answer!

3585 2018-04-06 23:23:58 Now that Soros is officially going to be trading crypto (assuming he hadn't already), I have no doubt we'll see 3-4k $btc. Whether we go to 9k or 14k first doesn't matter. Bull trap would actually make more sense imho.

3601 2018-04-06 23:22:03 You are going to get surprised by this one, I never promote shitcoins, even said to be careful when entering at 5. Do some research on it to see yourself
3602 2018-04-06 23:22:00 Sure do start doc!I'll be right behind u! 
3603 2018-04-06 23:21:46 Not about to #FF the fallen ones; grow. @CryptoHornHairs @crypto_loot @TheCryptoDog @AltcoinPsycho @CryptoCred @CryptoDonAlt @CryptoHustle
3604 2018-04-06 23:21:33 Not affected either, but I mean… could at least have done some 90s crypto to get to claim "we encrypted it"...
This is "get out of the field" bad.
3605 2018-04-06 23:21:12 You choose when you want to be accounted for as pink dollar or not. Think of it as permissive marketing. At the same time we can pool our economic activity and administer impact funds, eg for Egypt
3606 2018-04-06 23:21:05 I'm glad to hear that!
3607 2018-04-06 23:21:05 Maybe it'll reopen before Apr. 20 so we don't have to wonder.
3608 2018-04-06 23:20:47 Love it! I included a Misfits slide (& paper title!) (following a Daniel Ellsberg slide) at a symposium I spoke at in February! Haha
3609 2018-04-06 23:20:46 Eating wings and drinking beer at a restaurant , then back home to crypto for the weekend. When may lol?
3610 2018-04-06 23:20:27 Only stocks. You might as well throw your money in the street if you trade crypto lol. Plus taxes kill you on crypto trades, so its not worth it. I buy and hold crypto.
3611 2018-04-06 23:20:21 I'm looking forward to your project's further development. It’s a very good way to promote your project. Keep going on! Surely this project will go get success in the future.

3612 2018-04-06 23:20:16 Check my posts, previous posts and answers. Crypto sp.zoo is likely bitfinex owned company - because users had to send money to this company (i posted screenshot). The article mentions "C" owned by panama resident, you check owner of this company using public registry.
3613 2018-04-06 23:20:13 your "not trolling" tweet just cost us 3 more babies... stop. now.
3614 2018-04-06 23:20:00 #isupportcrypto india is the largest decomarcy in the world. What kind of example @RBI setting banning crypto to Fiat transaction. It's the cruel joke of democracy. Why can't indian government make the result public of poll that happened on my gov website.
@RBI shame on u
3615 2018-04-06 23:19:42 So interestingly enough, the last few weeks had seen talk of bans by govts, banks & social media giants. Then, a few days later, those same orgs announce plans to incorporate blockchain, ico, exchanges and coins.  Seems like the #NWO #oligarchy is at it again.  Thoughts? #crypto
3616 2018-04-06 23:19:41 I don't know if I feel sorry for the losses of longs, the possibility of the trading halt was high and they should've known it. First thing I did was to check if the code was volatility or something else. Everyone who had a position is now locked up though, which does suck.
3617 2018-04-06 23:19:07 The scalper who is surfing up and down too :D

3619 2018-04-06 23:18:22 Some projects have code forked PIVX and done right by keeping in the MIT references to PIVX.  Others seem to just CNTL-F "PIVX" - replace - "insert new coin name"...., remove any reference to #PIVX, and forget to track down all the other indicators that oh, this is a PIVX fork.
3620 2018-04-06 23:18:07 "Ghettoized"?? The Repuds brought this on themselves! By turning the teachings of Jesus Christ into crypto-fascism, and TRYING to force your religious beliefs on others and into the government, the constitution specifically states there shall be a separation of church and state!

3629 2018-04-06 23:17:05 Reminder: Monday is the CFP deadline for Black Hat USA. We’ve got a whole team of crypto people ready to review crypto track submissions.
3630 2018-04-06 23:16:58 That's good mate, that's good. But apart from this crypto madness, you good? This is absorving, make sure you eat, work out and disconnect man.

3632 2018-04-06 23:16:47 Too many people are focused on getting rich off of #crypto when we need them to be focused on growing the economy and advocating for the technology behind it. #BlockchainTechnology
3633 2018-04-06 23:16:44 I ultimately left the volcano thing out of this past week's Cybersecurity spiel, but I am definitely keeping this Biggie Smalls reference I just put in my slides for next week's class. #HowDoYouDoFellowKids

3635 2018-04-06 23:16:22 It is brilliant so many other #crypto projects are using #PIVX as it's jumping off point from a codebase standpoint.  The "issue" is the energy when folks seem to just "fork" or "copy" PIVX without honoring that whole MIT license/copyright/notice.

3637 2018-04-06 23:15:38 Invest in crypto. Bitcoin or Litecoin, every doller put in today will be a minimum 10x return in 5 years.
3638 2018-04-06 23:15:29 Holdings of call options that are in the money would be foolish to exercise above a certain level (let's say $10 or $15), because they would be betting that the stock wouldn't fall much further than the exercise price when the halt is lifted

3641 2018-04-06 23:14:59 Wow! I can’t believe how racist that was. Thanks for sharing, Josh. We need to expose crypto-NAZI propaganda.
3642 2018-04-06 23:14:58 Glad your keeping it real. You and Crypto Blood aren't being negative IMO just pragmatic brother! Those who doom and gloom or Lambo are living in their bubble. Sometimes it's good to view the forest from outside the trees!
3643 2018-04-06 23:14:54 PIVX is not an entity. If a community decision was enacted through our governance system to stop forking (aka not being open source) that would be the only way to say "PIVX" does not want that or this.

That said...My post above speaks for itself I hope.
3644 2018-04-06 23:14:38 It's free $ to the IRS motherfuckers they don't understand anything about crypto lol

Then all the greedy pump and dumpers get REKT and they get more free $. Then by the time they're done and they (maybe) come for you it's 2025-2030 and you S A V E D or can pay taxes with crypto

3649 2018-04-06 23:13:57 It's not a hack, it's a timestamp exploit. It will be 100% repaired in a few minutes. Also the new wallets will be out today.

3737 2018-04-06 22:59:56 Just made public that George Soros’ fund is into crypto. He could be a  blue whale if he is so inclined.

Meanwhile I’m just slowly accumulating BTC, eth, and ltc while reading white papers, trying to find good shitcoins.

3759 2018-04-06 22:55:15 i dont understand buy or having crypto on your platform! U can only use it like stock instead of sending and receiving it. Use Bianance or GDAX for crypto trading until robinhood understands what crypto is and provide wallet address so we can actually use it!

3762 2018-04-06 22:54:48 They wouldn't be able to do that though cause prices would sky rocket if they started purchasing large amounts of crypto.

3769 2018-04-06 22:52:49 Trouble was, the good times didn’t roll on, and now they’re back to square 1 (or minus 10 maybe) for HODLing.
3770 2018-04-06 22:52:49 That's for those who use the platforms but aren't familiar with crypto

3773 2018-04-06 22:52:36 Not true...there are no accidents in crypto.
3774 2018-04-06 22:52:30 Sell heavy on greed. Chances of diving in on the exact dip are remote. New cryptos in late 2017 were incredibly lucky IF they swapped their BTC for ALTs season at 20k and then ALSO sold the ALT top too PLUS sold their BTC to USD.
3775 2018-04-06 22:52:16 I don't think anybody did, this was daytrading pumping/dumping, short covering, and short squeeze.

3779 2018-04-06 22:51:13 At the end, crypto can only progress if willing to play it smart when it comes to regulations and the SEC. These are steps in the right direction
3780 2018-04-06 22:51:11 its amazing (and sad) how many people with large crypto balances are still looking for a free $10 here or there
3781 2018-04-06 22:50:51 This is currently misleading with crypto. Not all users can trade crypto on your app.

3785 2018-04-06 22:50:09 I think those running pump and dump groups and those not paying taxes on any crypto gains for many years are the easier targets and the ones who should be more worried.
3786 2018-04-06 22:50:05 So crypto is available to everyone now?
3787 2018-04-06 22:50:05 Now...everyone thinks ALTs have bottomed. Presumably that means BTC has bottomed too. Maybe it’s the case, but why not 3k BTC and more downside on ALTs? Who knows. Best to scale in/out. Buy heavy on capitulation - at least the bounce will be profitable, then scale again.
3788 2018-04-06 22:49:44 along the trend ...?

3809 2018-04-06 22:47:20 Well if that speculation drives people to buy more crypto I’ll be happy. More buyers sends price up. But I don’t want all these coins in the hands of bankers and hedge funds. They’ll manipulate only to their benefit and once again the common man will get fucked.
3810 2018-04-06 22:47:18 Could be the best or worst thing to wish on any crypto. Look up how he wrecked the bank of England
3811 2018-04-06 22:47:09 This tweet makes me feel like you weren't even around for Gox. Roger Ver has done more for crypto than pretty much anyone else around. I mean seriously the guy is called Bitcoin Jesus, or were you not around to remember that?

3817 2018-04-06 22:46:34 The coin is valuable to young people who will use the dapps that they're already using. It gives access to content, fun and leisure. It's valuable to virtual gamblers. It's valuable to content creators. It's the most useful crypto to hold since it's provides cross chain access
3818 2018-04-06 22:46:28 We will never know. But we do know that old school fin $ is coming to crypto, which is good because we are closer to massive adoption- but bad because more manipulation. We have to start planning and researching market behavior

3820 2018-04-06 22:46:09 Every1 heard the news about Soros "claiming" to come in the crypto soon. The fact is when the news reports it it's making a statement to record the date and make it seem Soros had nothing to do with this dip. Soros and his team has been in crypto manipulating a long time.

3821 2018-04-06 22:46:05 We all knew Bcash was going to be held largely by mining farms. A bunch of them jumped ship hoping for the flippening.
3822 2018-04-06 22:45:56 Thanks man
3823 2018-04-06 22:45:40 If you have some, maybe just hold onto it. If the price goes up nicely may make some profit. Though crypto is volatile as anything.b
3824 2018-04-06 22:45:39 Total Current Marketcap of crypto stands at around (at time of writing post): $229,759,761,085

Apple has enough spare cash to buy the majority of entire market (Apple's cash pile hits $285.1 billion on Feb 1st)

3867 2018-04-06 22:39:26 Investing involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for every one. The valuation may fluctuate, and, as a result, ones investment may lose value.
Buying $crypto is a way of investing, think about this when you do it  #DYOR
3868 2018-04-06 22:39:20 No they will dump it to $1k then buy it

3871 2018-04-06 22:38:34 There should be a reason to the deleted tweet imo.
3872 2018-04-06 22:38:27 Goodluck getting anyone to buy this  #nothanks
3873 2018-04-06 22:38:27 It’s true they got it, but they won’t get my children’s children. Because that type of data storing will not happen once crypto, blockchain, and decentralization takes over. History will look back on the last 20 years as the Wild West of the Internet.
3874 2018-04-06 22:38:26 4.2-4.8 ??
parabola break correction upto 79% i.e. - 4.2K
3875 2018-04-06 22:38:25 Lol did a “crypto” guy just ask what chart that is 
3876 2018-04-06 22:38:20 It’s because you run a pump and dump group.  You tell your paid group the coin and tweet it 30m later on the twitter idiots.

3878 2018-04-06 22:37:51 Mail, I actually agree with U on the Xmas special. I think they underpriced the services and saw that they were losing money on payouts. With crypto mkt crash and site problems and everything else, they decided to use delay tactics hoping things might change. (continue)

3881 2018-04-06 22:37:07 Im sorry for my missing tweets the last month or more. I am doped on morphine after a surgery and neck and back troubles.

3882 2018-04-06 22:37:05 Yes! if you don’t follow @TheCoinLawyer check him out! I loved what he said in his video today, that everybody should make it a point to intro 1 person to crypto every week! K.I.S.S. Just share basics so they don’t get overwhelmed/confused! This way we can  #marketcap. 
3883 2018-04-06 22:37:00 So they say, so I might buy a bit of crypto that day, or right after.
3884 2018-04-06 22:36:57 great to crypto in future
3885 2018-04-06 22:36:40 Dude.... If then its SEC approved, so allows institutional money to invest in crypto.

3889 2018-04-06 22:36:07 although thru my ~2 months on crypto twitter i have managed to get 33 followers  (most i think aren't real people lolz) might be better to stick with the day job
3890 2018-04-06 22:35:56 Can I vote for myself? If so then I like my Reddit design 
3891 2018-04-06 22:35:48 My point was, names floating around in crypto today will fade into history. In 20 years time,, the average punter using bitcoin will have no knowledge of its beginnings and neither will they care. Just like the majority do not know where fiat comes from today and care even less.

3899 2018-04-06 22:33:21 Most crypto enthusiasts see it as a beacon of independence from government control and a way to operate in complete privacy.
It's the opposite - the immutable transaction records & governments' cyber capabilities create a permanent 'trail of crumbs'  governments can & will follow
3900 2018-04-06 22:33:11 Wrong. Their amount of users dropped for the first time ever in 2017. It will be getting worse for them. Decentralized social media is the future. Steemit is good, but I don’t think the decentralized FB alternative exists yet. When it is created, it will be over for them.
3901 2018-04-06 22:33:11 @cz_binance care to comment? Normally you are always so open and communicative.

3905 2018-04-06 22:32:23 It was a learning experience. Now those who learnt from it will know that they must have an exit strategy. And stick to it. Greed does drive us to make wrong decisions.

3907 2018-04-06 22:32:05 yes, i believe it will be used against crypto users in poland. But the investigation and all facts are legit about money-laundering is legit. That would be way too far conspiracy theory :)
3908 2018-04-06 22:31:59 Fortune 500s hopping on $ETH and other alliances, #SEC taking #crypto #ETFs seriously. 1000's of Fortune 500 executives risking their career's & livelihood moving to #Blockchain companies.......are people not seeing what I'm seeing in the very near future.

3910 2018-04-06 22:31:45 "Shill". Another term used by those lacking in knowledge of how things in the Crypto-verse really works. I became an Ambassador because i was already doing the job. I promote the coin and a supportive community because i believe in the coin. Not because Im a VOLUNTEER Ambassador.
3911 2018-04-06 22:31:15 @narendramodi Sir i want to ask you why Indian government has never taken actions against bank who had illegally approved crs of loans without any verification. Do we pay taxes to cover up their frauds???And give us 1 good reason why have you ban crypto?? where is digital india??

3914 2018-04-06 22:30:22 IMO, This is a post-bullmarket syndrome. People got used to achieve 3-digit% returns and now, they don’t appreciate the money made at these levels. Appearently, most of them have not ever invested in other asset types. People are waiting fro drcades to achieve single digit gains

3934 2018-04-06 22:27:39 still, most bills come in fiat, ... the volatility in crypto means having to cash out and not hold crypto, or else risking the ability to pay the bills! It was different last year, for sure.

3938 2018-04-06 22:27:23 People saying crypto won’t be mainstream because ‘what if I lose my keys’ etc, should try going to their bank and asking them to replace the $100 bill they lost somewhere and see how that works out..

3948 2018-04-06 22:25:58 I'm losing my patience with crypto waiting for this consolidation to end. A lot of price dumps. Im inclined to just sit on the sidelines for now.

3970 2018-04-06 22:23:00 #Bitcoin is not a #cryptocurrency. It is a remittance system until goods and services are denominated in it.

3995 2018-04-06 22:18:40 I'm waiting on a withdrawal order from zebpay. Will take further steps after I see a deposit popup on my bank. I've seen screenshots of yes bank completely blocking crypto starting now. Just like HDFC did.

4001 2018-04-06 22:17:50 Spend a week trading on a Macbook with the fans sounding like an airplane, keyboard lights not working. Hear someone say hey a simple smc reset fixes that. IM SO MAD
4002 2018-04-06 22:17:27 im not too interested in the crypto banning in pakistan, im more interested in the ignorant retards commenting below.  Im not from Pakistan but these racists are making me LOL about their ignorance.
4003 2018-04-06 22:17:27 Imho initially it will cos panic spreads like wildfire and the tender hands of wealth managers cant hold shit. Few quaters in tho we would moon. Crypto is the easiest market to manuplate and mans gotta make a living

4036 2018-04-06 22:13:35 Until one crypto gets a real use case. A genuine link to fiat. If verges announcement is real. The whole crypto world should be behind it. Could make the whole industry more credible. People would look at every coin as the next possible acquisition/adoption.
4037 2018-04-06 22:13:31 If he’s coming in to trade he won’t care about the price only the entry exit points. It will be interesting to see the top 10-20 coins move with TA when they start pumping in the money.

4044 2018-04-06 22:12:32 that was first thing I looked for, esp after @Alpha_Architect crypto prank.
4045 2018-04-06 22:12:16 I don't think he's concerned with saving 10% on fees.. I'm sure he would just buy the exchange instead. #Soros

4049 2018-04-06 22:11:06 I'm not seeing Soros entering crypto as much of a positive to be honest.
4050 2018-04-06 22:10:51 
4051 2018-04-06 22:10:48 No way Coinbase would be involved in something fishy like this! #Sarcasm 
4052 2018-04-06 22:10:32 That’s the joke about how to tell if the NSA can crack 2048 bit crypto.

Write an incredibly funny, incredibly viral joke.

4053 2018-04-06 22:10:27 Lol he's trying to charge people $125 and doesn't know how to check volume. What a scam

4056 2018-04-06 22:10:23 Confession: #LitecoinFam

1) Some time ago after being in the stock market 4 couple years i was  intrigued by the crypto Market & decided 2 jump in and try for myself. Being completely ignorant of the blockchain & how cryptos work I made some money but in the end I lost a bunch
4057 2018-04-06 22:10:20 keep squeeing to 6600 and stabilize there for next years, so no more volatility= perfect coin of the world trust me

Welcome to $crypto. I’d like to take this opportunity to inform you of one of the best ICO’s out there. It’s $CTR. Now $CTR already has plenty of celeb endorsements but those celebs aren’t MM’s like u. Plus, it’s really really cheap rn!

4062 2018-04-06 22:09:12 Aion started that together with a call from PBC , but the volume remained high
4063 2018-04-06 22:08:57 Your article says that there won't be any changes users need to adapt to and payment gateways would keep working.
Not correct actually, they are shutting down fiat onramps to all crypto entities.
That pretty much ends the party for majority of investors unless courts reverse it.
4064 2018-04-06 22:08:56 Ha haaaaa just sell after the next announcement of an “announcement”

4069 2018-04-06 22:08:22 My daughter is a teacher and well-trained in firearms.  Let her have a gun hidden in her purse.  I worked in a public library and we all felt much safer knowing that one of our coworkers always had her gun in her purse.

4072 2018-04-06 22:08:09 I don't think he's concerned with saving 10% he'll just buy the exchange instead #Soros
4073 2018-04-06 22:08:07 If you've been losing money by being in the crypto world, it's rarely because you're unintelligent. It's more likely that you've been using a strategy that only works in a bull market.
4074 2018-04-06 22:08:03 Was talking to 2 buddies today trying to convince them to open a #crypto account... they told me they rather buy into strength or if they were going to catch a falling knife they would rather buy $fb $ge $tsla $nflx etc.

4091 2018-04-06 22:06:32 His family office invested in a firm who has a stake in another company who is somehow invested into crypto doesn’t mean Soros changed mind about cryptos! People who are invested into a pension fund which has some shares of a  gun company don’t necessarily support weapons!!!
4092 2018-04-06 22:06:29 "crypto was part of these studies" ... what crypto should they be leveraging here?

4142 2018-04-06 21:59:55 And this is why crypto will run the world at some point
4143 2018-04-06 21:59:55 Patience... Such an easy advice that very few people can follow.
4144 2018-04-06 21:59:44 This one I would watch.
4145 2018-04-06 21:59:42 Experts are predicting stocks could fall nearly 40% over the coming 18 months - I predict a huge boom for the crypto market
4146 2018-04-06 21:59:33 You have professional funds trying their best to pull 5%-15% per annum..

Then you have crypto buffoons who only consider taking profit over 100%

It's your money, the pros profit fast for a reason..
Just pump n dump everything, we are here for the same reason.
Money money money

4151 2018-04-06 21:58:43 Haha crypto nude life  #btc
4152 2018-04-06 21:58:36 $ETHBTC is establishing support around 0.054 and there's strong support around 0.047. However, $ETH still within downtrend and possible downside sits at 0.035 $BTC.
4153 2018-04-06 21:58:27 I bet there is no bigger threat to crypto than cybersecurity. There are many threats and evidence of malicious actors and too many points of centralization like exchanges. Everybody trades once. Few have a security strategy.
4154 2018-04-06 21:58:10 No need to panic it’s happened over the past years with crypto it’s bouncing back even higher BTFD
4155 2018-04-06 21:58:08 Who’s worse, Crypto fanatics or Never Trumpers?
4156 2018-04-06 21:58:08 Yes, but The fact that someone isn't willing to sit down and have an adult discussion is preventing it from being solved. It's a shame. There are good points to bch. But I struggle to sit through a roger ver sermon.
4157 2018-04-06 21:57:52 I haven’t seen a greater lack of confidence in the space as I have now. We have big things coming for our space and huge benefits to reap from projects that are disrupting corrupt industries and returning power to the people. $TEL $ICX $DENT #crypto
4158 2018-04-06 21:57:32 well that takes care of cryptocurrencies :-p
4159 2018-04-06 21:57:21 Ok you’re promoting your own profile screenshot on twitter. So what ideas in re decentralization are you using to gain some cred?  Cause twitter ads I don’t think take #crypto
4160 2018-04-06 21:57:18 We are not agree with RBI design on crypto
4161 2018-04-06 21:57:16 Hocam Neo nun merkezi olduğunu okumuştum bir yerde ama yazıyı bulamıyorum. Varsa bu konuda düşüncenizi alabilir miyim?
4162 2018-04-06 21:56:52 What's this about Soros beginning to invest in crypto? Apparently it's big news. Just came across it while doing some reading.

4164 2018-04-06 21:56:49 Look into justin sun. Graduate of jack ma's con college has become a crypto billionaire without actually making a product.  Copy pasta code. Marketing. No network. Big pumps.
4165 2018-04-06 21:56:13 Well I never knew all that about him.... I was more concerned about his crypto nonsense although I know pizza gate is real
4166 2018-04-06 21:56:09 If ETC gets listed on Coinbase I will send you 1,000$. Take screenshot.
4167 2018-04-06 21:56:05 Can you be "pumped"
Without pumping? I think it is allowed
4168 2018-04-06 21:56:01 If PIVX does not want people forking they should change the license.

4185 2018-04-06 21:54:11 Well I have traded ES futures and FX since 2008 (before I got into crypto) .
I did make a lot shorting it in 2015 and tried to replicate in '16 and got bit, so I was early.

But anyway, I don't understand your point about why fewer Americans are investing despite ATHs?
4186 2018-04-06 21:54:00 You should write a history book about crypto...
4187 2018-04-06 21:53:57 Who sees potential in Telecom cryptocurrency? Imo, Crypto has the potential to reach one or two billion unbanked people. Using crypto, mobile phone users in (emerging) markets could have better access to mobile money for transactions, such as remittances. Thoughts on #telcoin?
4188 2018-04-06 21:53:55 well, you guys would LOL.

4190 2018-04-06 21:53:52 The 2000 parabolic Nasdaq dotcom era created a craze for #daytrading. Same happened in the #Crypto parabolic move. Less skill is needed for success in strong trends, but when protracted corrections start, many fail because they can't adapt quickly.

4198 2018-04-06 21:52:41 @Tokenlend_news  will accept only mortgage loans at first with the most trustworthy real estate properties as a pledge. It will allow to achieve best risk/income value for the users. then eventually grows to offer another loans. #tokenlend #ICO #crypto
4199 2018-04-06 21:52:25 btw goodmorning beautiful!!!!! 
4200 2018-04-06 21:52:19 Takes balls and effort really to do this and also trade 
People are desperate for it too some people feel they need to pay for it 
Better it goes to honest teachers rather than scams (coz there definitely are some scams ie Picasso)
4201 2018-04-06 21:52:01 Spent afternoon at #bank, had issues with transferring #money and a hold on an account. Thy suggested I "stop sending money back and forth so much" to avoid more delays.

Dinosaur fiat #banking can't possibly complete with #crypto, those who don't realize that yet are blind.

4202 2018-04-06 21:52:00 Yeah, assuming an adequate remedy at law (like cash), fair point.  Same re the unjust enrichment count in the complaint.  Still an interesting move.  Also, imagine a situation where there isn't enough cash to make people whole, then maybe more viable in theory.
4203 2018-04-06 21:51:55 I fucking got into crypto end of December and turned $15k into $55k in like 3 days and thought I was on my way to the moon...  even my kid told me to pull out my initial investment! I.DID.NOT.
4204 2018-04-06 21:51:26 Thank you sir!

These people (like @Crypto_Ed_NL) see a niche in the market and exploit it
It's just clever business and it means taking intiative and putting yourself out there, risking your reputation too if you fail

4224 2018-04-06 21:48:22 Very interesting that the plaintiffs are seeking an equitable remedy like this. Huge precedent if the court orders specific performance. Low probability because: innocent third parties (Nano), forum non conveniens, cash is possible, to name a few
4225 2018-04-06 21:48:08 Imagine waking up to this... I’m so confused 
4226 2018-04-06 21:47:42 VERGE = 
Why we need this when we have already @fluffypony and Monero ? Look they even took down ASICs with the Monero Fork, VERGE is just like TRON hype gambling coins with no real purpose behind, Coins ask money before they really plan something instead of Coins
4227 2018-04-06 21:47:40 There's lots of new competition in the top 100 coins on CMC that didn't exist before the Tezos ICO, some of these are also planning a change to DPOS/POS
Is Tezos still relevant considering this fact and if so what sets it apart from other platforms?
4228 2018-04-06 21:47:34 People getting ready to load up on crypto at the up coming bottom. Then make in a year  what takes ten+ in the stock market . Smart money goes,  smart places.
4229 2018-04-06 21:47:31 The Essentia project is fully ICO, quickly going to the necessary amount for the development of the project and judging by the road map next month we are waiting for a lot of updates on the project.

4260 2018-04-06 21:43:44 Ways I got rekt in 2017:

1. Doing TA before FA. Charts are universal, strong fundamentals are not

2. Fomo'ing crap Twitter calls

3. Spreading myself too thin

4270 2018-04-06 21:42:26 Was this an exercise in finally separating those who understand sarcasm from those who never will?
4271 2018-04-06 21:42:11 On the Idea level: The white paper was aimed at solving the Double Spending banking problem, and the Crypto side came from preventing excessive spam by making you pay a CPU cost to send... but Bitcoin arrived as a tangible product, not just an idea.

4391 2018-04-06 21:26:39 It hurts, but if crypto goes to 0, I'll have been prepared - the chance of that happening is less than 1%, but it's important to have an escape plan in case. Vae victis.

4403 2018-04-06 21:24:01 Weekend #crypto news update:

1. SEC being patient with regulation
2. Coinbase in talks to become SEC-regulated brokerage
3. Launch of Coinbase Ventures to invest in crypto startups
4. George Soros to begin trading crypto

Remain long term bullish!

Last man standing wins the contest.

4446 2018-04-06 21:18:53 I had an amazing day @CoinFestUK. Such an awesome put together of this event. 

A very big thank you to the organisers for taking crypto awareness very seriously. We need more of these type of events. Again thank you.

4461 2018-04-06 21:17:04 Some of my trading friends use candles & find them quite useful. But they generally read them in conjunction with other signals & indicators on the chart too.
4462 2018-04-06 21:17:04 Satoshi embezzled all funds
4463 2018-04-06 21:16:58 Wall St. gets market cycles so they shorted the crap out of btc since dec17th. Few clear minded traders like angelo cobain loops have called tops as well. But idiots like Bruce Fenton kept shilling btc at 15-20k as perfectly sane entry points.
4464 2018-04-06 21:16:47 IMO, that's been an America and China thing with respect to Crypto.  Most countries in Europe and a lot of other countries (Japan) have been pretty reasonable all-in-all.
4465 2018-04-06 21:16:44 I dont know why anyone bothers paying tax on crypto, how many ppl do you know have gone to prison for not paying their crypto related taxes? theyre relying on everyones compliance as they will never have the resources to verify all ofthis. B smart, dont cash out through coinbase
4466 2018-04-06 21:16:40 Wow thanks for sharing man. It actually worked for me! Finally my kids will be able to go back to the school and stop working in the farm!

4516 2018-04-06 21:11:06 Think long term #crypto people. If you’re in now, you’re ahead of most institutional $ AND mass adoption. Take the stairs to success not the elevator. Invest responsibly. Be PATIENT. Take profits when appropriate. And DYOR! #longxrp #HODL #xrpthestandard #XRP #Ripple

4561 2018-04-06 21:06:48 When people say "blockchain not bitcoin", are they not just referring to other blockchains/cryptos not named Bitcoin? I still don't understand why crypto-Twitter throws so much shade at these individuals.

4693 2018-04-06 20:52:43 Crypto is a liquidity trade/liquidity Ponzi scheme. When central banks ease the cryptos float. Not so when CBs tighten. Someone will be left holding the bag.
4694 2018-04-06 20:52:32 Bitcoin is the only crypto with truly robust decentralization. as a digital value protocol, the design is ideal. it dominates mindshare, usage, and network effects. it should be 90% of the market, or more. alt coins live on borrowed time, eventually the market runs out of fools.

4705 2018-04-06 20:51:09 Number of posts with context of “exiting cryptomarkets” and “leaving cryptosphere” are at all time high! This level of  #REKT ness is product of poor risk management! Stay well-informed and prepared for any kind of uncertainty out there.

Not a bad place to be a founder. But spend some time

4744 2018-04-06 20:47:13 I think it’s the amount of attention crypto requires. He’s a competent trader it just requires a ton of focus.

4766 2018-04-06 20:44:11 Kringles are the smallest change of the crypto-currency TBC.  

0.00000001 TBC = 1 Kringle.  

The way you can calculate the conversion of Kringles into TBC is by dividing the Kringles by 100,000,000 to get the TBC equivalent.  100,000 Kringles divided by 100,000,000 = 0.001 TBC.

4782 2018-04-06 20:43:18 Having said that, the organization that is able to combine an easy #crypto exchange interface, like Coinbase or #Robinhood, with a mobile payment processing function like Applepay will have created the ULTIMATE crypto killer app.

4800 2018-04-06 20:41:01 It was only a matter of time..with all the new innovative concepts that are possible through the use of blockchain tech it would be difficult for those with capital to resist...only question is when will mainstream banks accept crypto along side fiat currency?

4822 2018-04-06 20:38:54 This is what I predict happening. We will bounce hard at that double bottom area , buuut this isn't the break for the bull run. We will get ANOTHER X failure at the main downtrend line and fall to lower zones and this is where capitulation occurs.

4845 2018-04-06 20:36:20 If 5.9 doesn't hold next support is that 4k zone . I stated that too.
4846 2018-04-06 20:36:13 Sorry to hear that, Laura; must be really frustrating! I've seen the free crypto scammers have also started getting people's accounts banned now who reply to warn others by reporting their account en masse (causing an auto-ban). Unfortunately the ball's solely in Twitter's court.
4847 2018-04-06 20:36:12 @NeerajKA is only pretending to be Indian, he works for the cia.

4859 2018-04-06 20:35:08 They’ve made it easier to acquire IOUs, no doubt. Unfortunately, many people don’t know the difference. That was the one point I tried to make clear in my article: Bitcoin is a set of keys. Whoever holds the keys, controls the crypto.
4860 2018-04-06 20:34:52 can you in anyway please explain me what will happen? I don't understand...

4862 2018-04-06 20:34:47 Portfolio ~70%

BUT, I am feeling more bullish on $crypto than ever before.

Great times are coming. 

With that said, handle your wins as gracefully as I hope youve handled your losses.

“I told you so’s” dont grow our community.

A culture of cooperation and inclusion does.

4930 2018-04-06 20:26:36 Soros denigrated Bitcoin as a bubble but said that crypto would not have a “very sharp break” as most asset bubbles do.  As long as you have dictatorships on the rise you will have a different ending - rulers in those countries will turn to Bitcoin to build a nest egg abroad...

4997 2018-04-06 20:19:47 Not yet. And you can't FOIA the court. Also, I dispute that a right of access means folks should have to specifically ask the clerk to unseal something they have a right to see, rather than the clerk affirmatively unsealing as a matter of course. That should be standard practice.

5010 2018-04-06 20:18:49 The letter also state "not to pursue enforcement action of any prior activity".. A regulator, in my opinion, would never make such a statement. I am surprised by that.

 Happy though with the overall work to become regulated. Big step forward.

We understand RBI care about our money and stable financial system.

But before banning crypto please bring back the money which has taken from the banks by businessmans and run away from country.

Also please try to understand what is before banning.
5015 2018-04-06 20:18:28 Obvious lie since one of you pesky Tron folk got me banned for 12hours, my notifications have been blowing up, there's way more of you trying to defend your precious shitcoin.

5042 2018-04-06 20:16:18 Coinbase is probably the easiest for crypto noobs.

Get a coinbase account and a block chain account.

When you deposit buy it from coinbase. Send to your block chain and then send to the sportsbook

And when you withdraw your money send it from the book to your block chain to CB

Since liquidity is much higher than 2013, would that shorten the time frame exponentially this bear market?

Great to see people prepared to share, even on tech not directly related to their current stack in work.

You never know what ideas come from it.
5090 2018-04-06 20:12:35 Beginners always ask for advice how to trade this market. The answer: You don't. Range trading (scalping) is not impossible but there are good reasons not to. Pro traders wait for setups. If that means 0 trades in 3 months, then a professional accepts that without irritation.
5091 2018-04-06 20:12:33 Yes and they lose more money than others.

RBI indirectly bans crypto.
The move has been taken to protect banks from crypto-fraud that poses a serious threat to the stability of India's economy.

5238 2018-04-06 19:57:58 So... QUESTION from a non-techie/non- #crypto geek:.

PoS = bad ?
PoW = good ?

('Cuz Proof of Stake requires miners to be online constantly, and penalizes them if they ever go offline?)

So all PoS coins are bad?

And Proof of Work is best if Asic-resistant?

5272 2018-04-06 19:55:03 Lol it was 2011 man.  Not an excuse, but things were very different back then.  At a certain point someone needs access to the hot wallet, creates vulnerability no matter who you are.

5275 2018-04-06 19:54:26 @balajis @VinnyLingham @naval @NeerajKA  and all others respected, Any comments on present Indian government take on crypto currency future in India.
5276 2018-04-06 19:54:14 If this news comes out officially, we could see the biggest short squeeze in crypto history. And we would definitely know that, that would have been orchestrated by the big boys with the big toys !!

- George Soros is getting into crypto.
- A Credit Suisse banker is leaving to start a new venture having to do with security tokens.

5296 2018-04-06 19:52:38  Kumar this is becoming a love hate relationship and we already experience that from btc..

we are all very passionate about this tech... crypto is a nonstop fast passed field so we have to mix it us with some fun to stay sane... you will see a lot of it in this space
5297 2018-04-06 19:52:35 are you windsurfing yet?
5298 2018-04-06 19:52:28 Shouldn’t you be applying for jobs or still hoping to get “rich” from cryptos?
5299 2018-04-06 19:51:58 It’s always applied. No new tax law or rules were created. No interpretation note published. SARS basically made a media statement confirming that crypto has always been taxable as revenue or CGT in terms of existing tax laws and rules. So short answer: yes  #cryptotax
5300 2018-04-06 19:51:45 Better than ETFs
5301 2018-04-06 19:51:44 The real story will be about the funds that figure out how #cryptocurrencies eventually correlate to other asset classes. Anyone else get excited by a crypto book in a global macro hedge fund?

5313 2018-04-06 19:50:53 It’s very early doors for crypto I think. Like 1995 was for the Internet. Nobody knew what the ‘essence’ was back then. People who understood it knew it would change things. That’s where I think we are with crypto

5334 2018-04-06 19:48:44 If you're a crypto legend and you truly just want to give back, you likely don't charge. If you're skilled and quit your 9 to 5 to trade crypto and need to supplement your meager income, all you're doing is training the competition; which isn't smart. This leaves only raccoons
5335 2018-04-06 19:48:40 its easier to spot the bottom 
5336 2018-04-06 19:48:36 what you do?
5337 2018-04-06 19:48:34 Very interesting to see how #crypto will react to downtrending stock market. You have to think some money is going to leave stocks and fly to cheap crypto assets, viewed as a global currency to some investors.

5405 2018-04-06 19:41:31 Thank you for saying this. Twitter was full of those pseudo-cryptogeniuses that were supersmart to sell early, making fun of everyone who is rightfully frightened, but in reality were super bullish prior to the crash and probably lost quite a lot themselves.

5420 2018-04-06 19:40:10 This man just doesn't get democracy. The Labour Party is it members, who overwhelming elected Corbyn and have the power to elect someone else. But they don't want to. So who does he mean when he says "Labour" - Blair and his wee anachronistic bunch of elitists and crypto-Tories?

5430 2018-04-06 19:39:38 TLDR: India looking into creating their own crypto, following in the steps of Singapore and China.

5478 2018-04-06 19:33:58 Why hold #crypto? Because the bank wants to hold your money and give you 3% interest after they turn-over billions. A small step towards a #decentralized society, move #fiat away from the banks.

5482 2018-04-06 19:33:42 I know this is an emotional question to many, to me it is more an interesting problem , and I am supportive of crypto as a technology . Don’t mean to step on anyone’s toes. The crazy-word in previous tweet was supposed to be humorous and aimed at both sides.

5539 2018-04-06 19:28:36 Önemi nedir bu tarihlerin 
5540 2018-04-06 19:28:19 Only if you’re arguing against the broadest possible analogy (if so, agreed). Elites like Wences Caseres have made more targeted analogies, arguing bitcoin is similar to early internet protocols in that it is most likely to become the global crypto standard.
5541 2018-04-06 19:27:51 That makes 2 as Circle Poloniex is trying the same.
5542 2018-04-06 19:27:43 Quite possibly. Which is why the naive rookie "funds" are going to diversify into things going to $0 and will be out of the game quickly. I bet the eventual best of the crypto funds aren't even in the game yet

5558 2018-04-06 19:26:34 1. It’s the Soros family office, George isn’t involved as much  2. Institutional money in crypto is great: doesn’t matter if long or short 3. FYI riskier for institutional whales to short due to counterparty risk 4. They’ll be long biased (#3 & longer horizons vs cryptotwitter)

5562 2018-04-06 19:26:02 lol there's no potential for crypto growth. the tokens/coins are worthless and have zero use case. blockchain has plenty of uses, but none of them require coins/tokens. 

oh wait I forgot about money laundering and paying for illicit goods. my apologies!

5589 2018-04-06 19:23:50 That's just silly. Just as 95% of startups go to $0, I think all but 3-5 of the existing cryptocurrencies are likely to go to $0 and that is not zero sum, so I can still believe that crypto networks are the most impactful invention in the last 20 years.

5597 2018-04-06 19:23:20 Le gros problème c'est que la plupart des gens - et même ceux dans la crypto - ne font pas la distinction entre la valeur d'un coin et la technologie derrière. Quand le #bitcoin monte, la blockchain est une innovation. Quand ça baisse, c'est une arnaque...

5613 2018-04-06 19:22:08 the short answer is that alaskan residents own the rights to all of Alaskas resources and it was written into our state constitution that a portion of oil profits goes into an account and gets invested we then split a portion of the years profits. the account has done well

5617 2018-04-06 19:21:59 Def bad news for all of crypto short term. These guys are not fans of crypto, they came not to trade but to suppress and slow down mainstream adoption of blockchain. But at the end they will loose because real money and real value and innovation will always win.

5629 2018-04-06 19:20:55 The risk that crypto networks enable economic sovereignty, the core of which might be BTC, in which case not only is BTC not a bubble, but by far the best investment on the planet right now.

Buy on cheap at private sale or pre-ICO (Highest risk, bcos it may not even make it to the exchanges)
OR
when your “fundamentally sound” coin has fell out of favour & reached the “floor”.

Smallblockers:  sensible people with crazy arguments

Bigblockers: crazy people with sensible arguments.

To discard a simple, quick solution for a serious problem in favor for a complex long term solution. Is that why R flipped?
5693 2018-04-06 19:12:17 The skill is in the seamless transition.

5704 2018-04-06 19:11:17 It’s impossible to predict any security a year out let alone one as speculative as crypto. It could to $200 just as easy as it could go to $2000. I could ask someone on the street to pick a number between 1 and 5000 and that number is just as likely as these targets.

5730 2018-04-06 19:09:17 Did they actually announce they will rebrand? I’ve been away for a while, but i do agree that their name could and should be improved for marketing purposes.

5734 2018-04-06 19:09:01 Banning is not the way. I would load up my crypto, grind, earn, multiply my investment, and go in countries where it is legal. Exchange  it for fiat or even better to go to Las Vegas and spend my hard earned BTC. Money is the language everyone knows and BTC is now money #BTC

In the crypto crunch we’re in, how would an increase in txs be a good thing, when crypto spending power as been deeply decreased?

5828 2018-04-06 19:01:02 if course there's a ton of froth and fraud and poorly designed experiments. We're in 1995 in crypto. Almost everything to date SHOULD fail and will, but that doesn't mean crypto won't be a closer to your $311Q impact in the long run.

5856 2018-04-06 18:58:38 Just remember that this does not mean only buying and marketorders. Crypto is also very interesting as a testbed for traders, with HFT bots et cetera. Mostly because it's still unregulated so there can be washtrades and spooforders. You CAN enter the crypto space and open shorts
5857 2018-04-06 18:58:24 only people who don’t believe in crypto want XRP
5858 2018-04-06 18:58:17 but you just said "at least with biotech" as if biotech startups aren't trying to build something fundamentally new & different. All early stage investing is speculation. Meanwhile, tokenizing assets is not even speculative or innovative, it's the low hanging fruit of crypto.

5944 2018-04-06 18:48:26 FB is going to comply w congress and try to set up walled gardens to defend from competitors. People will move to distributed crypto networks. Sen. Klobuchar and Ron Wyden are gonna be ticked!

He could literally crush crypto into the ground and some are celebrating like its a good thing. This is a bad thing as he is responsible

6004 2018-04-06 18:42:26 DOW goes down 700 points in one day it's a "sizeable correction" Bitcoin goes down 5% it's tanking and the end of the world for $crypto.

6007 2018-04-06 18:42:05 Right, but who is going to be big lenders?  If not banks, crypto lenders?  If that happens the crypto lenders will be THE SAME as the banks, why, because you can't just go up to anyone and ask for 100's of 1000's with a promise to pay them back.

6077 2018-04-06 18:35:18 crypto is a new asset class that may or may not subsume $10's of trillions worth of assets and securities and there can't be more than a few $B under management by funds currently. Sure, there is some rank amateurism and naivety on the part of many, it's far from oversaturated

6112 2018-04-06 18:31:46 Funny. Though it does have its use cases in log integrity and the concept of an immutable and transparent ledger. When used for real world applications and not just a crypto currency coin it takes on a different form.

6117 2018-04-06 18:31:08 Phase 1 of the govt crackdowns on crypto has just begun globally this year. Imperative for more decentralised services to gain traction.

6175 2018-04-06 18:27:05 IRS wants us to make the best efforts to pay our taxes. Tracking crypto to crypto events will be extremely burdensome depending on your portfolio. This sounds like a conservative overkill to me, hence I will not be using services that tries to make my life unwarrantedly harder

6235 2018-04-06 18:20:49 But I’m not buying the coins for thousands only to loose it .. I’m buying into the tech companies producing the underlying.. I  am watching and spreading my money around
6236 2018-04-06 18:20:48 And I'm in the camp that believes the Crypto community needs a singular point for PR badly  - it's like the same disjointed messaging you'd see from biotech groups.
6237 2018-04-06 18:20:43 He already said he doesn't care about the money, and he obviously doesn't get any positive energy from taking part in crypto. Money is not everything to some, peeps got to respect that.

I just took a step back from everything cryptorelated
6238 2018-04-06 18:20:38 He is one of the traders/analysts i follow on youtube...used to do stocks, options etc and now he focuses on the crypto market

6297 2018-04-06 18:15:37 I think that Charles himself criticized this mechanism and said that money should be raised stage by stage upon advancement of the project. Now if the crypto investors are ready to go all in in every ICOs then why bother

I only retweeted the Bloomberg article about @georgesoros approving his 26 billion dollar fund to start trading in crypto. He is very evil and apart of the “world elite” so if he’s in then something big is coming.

6346 2018-04-06 18:12:01 in an ideal world, other than the fact satoshi mined the first 10 months solo and therefor became a 'single entity' who own the majority.

Until laws are made, definitions from the past in a fast moving tech as crypto is something you can only grasp as where it was 'intended' for
6347 2018-04-06 18:12:00 Yes they’re!

6385 2018-04-06 18:09:03 The worst type of person on $crypto twitter:

People who comment "REKT" on a leverage trade someone posts immediately after it didn't work out.

People who dig up month(s) old charts and go "Wow ___X___ coin is not doing well what a horrible call you made".
6386 2018-04-06 18:08:52 "on the moon..."  He's referring to his butt.  The Cartel is mooning us! 
6387 2018-04-06 18:08:42 Remember, traditional Wash Sale rules don't apply to crypto because the volatility of even USD-pair markets is such that even periods of less than a week can be considered safe

6418 2018-04-06 18:05:49 Please don’t take it as an insult to a particular coin. Its definitely not the case. I’m just saying when you always see “announcements of announcements”, it gets old and hurts legitimate coins and projects that use that method by causing indirect disinterest in future investors.

Yet debate does help ideas grow--even if it's not the most healthy or civilized.

6525 2018-04-06 17:58:16 The goal is for cardano to become the first trillion dollar market cap crypto currency as mentioned by Charles in an older interview. They want to achieve that valuation based on their technology’s fundamental value to society, not speculative assumptions and hype.

6527 2018-04-06 17:58:03 BTC futures contracts and ETF’s that settle in futures or cash are tools to separate the capital from going into Cryptos.

6537 2018-04-06 17:57:16  If Soros enters the crypto market, it’ll be OTC, not using exchanges.  OTC in a bear market is high demand because you get a discount. Soros entering will have no direct bull effect other than continued #crypto evangelists artificially pumping coins for wrong reasons.

6562 2018-04-06 17:54:34 Another way is to invest in crypto currencies.  Once they recover, the game is back on.  Just like our stock markets. The big guys drive prices up and down making propits along the way. Same hasppening with cryptos.  Low prices are great opportunities with the right ones.
6563 2018-04-06 17:54:33 by the read of all responses,

6646 2018-04-06 17:46:55 if bcash is #bitcoin why does it represent only 5% of total crypto's market cap? And why an "altcoin" like bitcoin is 10 times worthier?
6647 2018-04-06 17:46:44 And @SatoshiLite has always been a great bastion for alt coins. Neither of which have conducted themselves the way in which Justin shill have, ever.
6648 2018-04-06 17:46:43 And that is why rushed new regulations are not justified. #UK approach of observing how crypto interact with existing regulation is logical, pragmatic and conducive for innovation

6673 2018-04-06 17:44:44 The decision of RBI to ban banks from buying crypto currency is a shocking decision. Who is RBI to decide what people should do with their money. We will buy anything we want from anywhere we like. Earlier it was limited to credit cards now even saving accounts also banned.
6674 2018-04-06 17:44:42 As someone who was around back then and profited from getting in Eth early I'd say it really wasn't, In fact I'd say most didn't have a clue what if was gonna for the ecosystem. There was obvious issue with funding and Dao. Different incomparable times.

6776 2018-04-07 23:44:06 Yes, but all the people that googled bitcoin back then won't do it again. that stat doesn't mean much. Unless you are counting on ALL new money coming in. Then we are doomed.

6778 2018-04-07 23:43:44 I kind of feel that way about most Crypto founders or “genius leaders”. They all have massive inferiority complexes.   Educate was the wrong word.
6779 2018-04-07 23:43:12 With this being a low volume breakdown is there a chance this could be another short trap?

6784 2018-04-07 23:42:02 Back then no one knew that much about crypto. All the people that googled bitcoin aren't going to do it again. Google trends isn't really a good indicator.

6834 2018-04-07 23:31:10 That would make sense but they would need to be aware that Crypto-currency has been ruled a commodity by the SEC. So Federal statutes would have to be considered as well as some way to track things other than the "On your Honor" method of taxation.

6867 2018-04-07 23:24:45 I’m pretty sure less than 3% of all crypto holders are actually filing taxes on it, so my bet is No, taxes are NOT contributing to any run-offs.
6868 2018-04-07 23:24:35 Nah bruh, that's on you 
6869 2018-04-07 23:24:30 Is it also potentially people like me who bought with some extra cash when it was at a frenzy in January and just forget about it and will check back in a few years?

6871 2018-04-07 23:24:00 With BTC dominance remaining flat and others getting into alts, I'm curious if alt season is really among us in the near future. Once taxes are filed by April 17 then we could expect some action. I think those who have received their refund checks are spending it back on crypto

180 Fiat currencies. That everyone uses everyday, crypto's can die and are. I want to see $BTC process 10x normal transactions without every exchange on the planet falling over instantly. Crypto will get there $BTC will not. Certainly not unregulated.

6903 2018-04-07 23:17:46 I believe crypto-currency is to be taxed as if a stock or foreign currency. You bought at X, you sold at Y, taxed on gains. I am definitely not an expert though.

6909 2018-04-07 23:17:12 "Justin Sunerok says the partnership will be announced April 16, the day after the final deadline for filing taxes." He's probably using the funds that were raised to pay his taxes  #crypto #verge #XVG $xvg #vergecurrency
6910 2018-04-07 23:16:43 Tether-attached to something. What if crypto investors money is matched with drug money so the drug money would look legitimate and they'll be able to move it-tethered. Hmm

-You will have your VMs tested & ready for LiveNet, not trying to figure out what ports to open etc. Then Clone Clone Clone 
-I wanted Vitalik to sweat some more
-Something to show the haters who say "what network"

6916 2018-04-07 23:15:15 Crypto is surely the most profitable asset to be trading given the huge volatility? I’m yet to understand why a good trader would stick to forex or other traditional markets products. Can you enlighten me?
6917 2018-04-07 23:15:11 People who don't have vision, don't have strategy, lack commitment then they go onto complain over missed opportunities, especially in crypto.

6929 2018-04-07 23:13:34 Hi @Super_Crypto in your honest opinion Do you think btc will just hover between $5-$15k while cartels manipulate & profit from the price over and over? Or do u think new ATH’s will be seen? What about alts like XRP that are not as pegged to btc anymore and actually are useful?

7026 2018-04-07 22:55:00 Most of our crypto profiting problems come from not experimenting enough strategies or simply being too confident of our methods.

It's rarely because your IQ is too low, the market is bearish or other excuses people have for not making money.

7030 2018-04-07 22:53:40 And it's for these reasons that crypto won't be adopted by the mainstream for a very, very long time and won't MOON. The epitome of 'shooting yourself in the foot'!
7031 2018-04-07 22:53:21 Thanks, followed you back!

7033 2018-04-07 22:53:17 We see where you're coming from, but our priority is to help developers increase their revenue while enabling gamers to delve into more valuable gaming worlds. If we can achieve that, we believe it will create more trust in the crypto market.

7105 2018-04-07 22:34:04 Definitely could be. There's some reason they were pulled from circulating supply, but definitely important for everyone to know the difference of removing and burning, don't want people to start FOMO'ing over a burn that hasn't happened yet lol

7111 2018-04-07 22:32:46 This guy just says some shit no one understands what he means then tells you I told you so when something big happens. Of course I'm going to wait for an inevitable breakout to occur before investing my whole stack into crypto
7112 2018-04-07 22:32:43 $ONT up over 26.01% past 24 hours #Cryptocurrency #Crypto
7113 2018-04-07 22:32:30 Crypto alt coins going down by the day.  A lot of new people were deceived by bad players.  And from what I hear from the ones that have been in the crypto space for many years “we’ve been here before” at the lows.  Now I’m wondering should I stay or should I go?
7114 2018-04-07 22:31:51 Makes sense.  
My theory is the reduced amount is a future burn based on tokens signed up to run on the main net and currently participating in the test net.  Therefore, they pull them from circulating supply so that when the main net is launched they can immediately burn them.
7115 2018-04-07 22:31:22 Tryin' to encapture the crypto environment is the same paradigm as tryin to net air.
Good luck! 
The data is indistinguishable from any other encrypted data flow.
And if it is distinguishable? Well, hold my beer 
7116 2018-04-07 22:31:19 Interested as to how your btc count stayed so high / went up when it seems like you mostly hold altcoins?
7117 2018-04-07 22:30:55 FUD- the ability of one to create uncertainty which enables them to buy more of a good at a cheaper price for a longer period of time.... Or they are just a troll.

7140 2018-04-07 22:26:33 Not for certain yet. I asked the person I know at Tron and she is looking into why it's showing that. But for certain, when you burn a coin it's forever, so it would affect both Total and Circulating, so the coin burn, for alot of reasons, has not happened yet.

7153 2018-04-07 22:24:40 Actually No, neither myself nor Cheds is showing up in people’s mentions insisting something is true.
7154 2018-04-07 22:24:32 Webkit says it will support it in 2018. It's not working with Apple... It still has to be developed as even the webkit website only shows the ILP on the roadmap. And that allows it to work with any crypto or FIAT. Yes, it may be progress your your intro here is a bit of a stretch
7155 2018-04-07 22:24:22 same, but ill add more if it closes above 1240 :) i doubt btc will let it though

7293 2018-04-07 22:02:41 Exactly. In crypto land you aren't supposed to see things as they are, you are supposed to put the most bullish possible slant on every single thing. But that's not sensible, your job as trader is to interpret new evidence objectively in the now moment.

7295 2018-04-07 22:02:29 I never block or ban anybody. We have moderators doing that - for ppl who oust vulgar info or language. Your Q- we don’t see a dump, if it were to occur below $5890 range, Kiss all crypto goodbye.

On one side Respected @narendramodi ji requests Indians to go digital. Wants a digital India. And on the other side, we see @RBI cutting off the use of digital currency. Makes no sense. Crypto currency and blockchain are the future. #isuppprtcrypto

7305 2018-04-07 22:00:56 From experience on Dartmoor, the Crypto escaped unscathed for most of the winter, presumably sheep were put off by the prickles. Toward the back end though, everything was snipped off unexpectedly :-( time for that new fence, methinks!
7306 2018-04-07 22:00:53 Wow....thats some commitment.
Crypto has been bad for the ticker in 2018.
I'm hoping to get back my investment towards the end of summer and keep the heart from racing, hopefully it booms enough that I can HODL some for my retirement fund after that. 
7307 2018-04-07 22:00:34 These crypto cards are not going to be a hit ant will fail. I’d be surprised is any of them even release a card. In particular MCO.
7308 2018-04-07 22:00:24 @Crypto_Brahma hi sir ! Wanted to ask you two questions... do you have any TA classes coming up? Also what is your projection on $xspec once bull run should begin? I've searched for any you have to say as an update since your projection and I couldnt find anything. Thanks for all

7319 2018-04-07 21:59:57 No, I don’t think so. 

Crypto Market speculated institutional investment was going to arrive upon the release of Bitcoin futures. This hasn’t happened hence, the prolonged dip. Can’t see an uptrend until a real macro event occurs. Market is too immature for this at the moment.

Glad you're in good company. Best of luck on your crypto journey!
7333 2018-04-07 21:57:20 hi Marius, do you see skyhigh dollar prices for crypto and silver in the scenario of rampant dollar devaluation or in terms of real purchasing power? both prob  and do you expect a market meltdown in global stock- and creditmarkets any time soon?

7351 2018-04-07 21:54:09 So much good work being done by company Ripple that created crypto currency $XRP. It is priced today at $0.49 per digital coin. #XRP is poised to skyrocket  soon as they continue to make agreements with worldwide banks and corporations. #xrp@$200by2020
7352 2018-04-07 21:54:09 my 1st thought, too

Robinhood is trying, but...whoever gets on board with crypto first will WIN!

Cuz crypto community is no longer OG's & vets...it's newbies trying to find user friendly interfaces

ok, rant over. Back to my painstaking research for a usable portfolio ap
7353 2018-04-07 21:53:59 What I don't like is seeing crypto twitter losers buy into this low time frame rally and the majority of the crowd following, you don't need to do that. It is still a counter wave of a downtrend on a high time frame, wait for it to set up inside the box range, then hit it.

7364 2018-04-07 21:53:07 I'm not Charlie obviously but here's what I think. The reason crypto market is so volatile is because so few people are using it. The cryptos are in the hands of a few so any trade placed will significantly affect it's price. We will see higher volatility as mainstream starts
7365 2018-04-07 21:53:04 I never said they intentionally removed the copyright on the post you are refering to. Yes, the tone in which I wrote it indicated that it can be frustrating when attribution is not given to the work that has gone into #PIVX.

7370 2018-04-07 21:52:12 For damn sure. And the allure of crypto as "get rich quick" unfortunately clouds judgement and lowers defense so to speak because people think this market is "so easy". Which like you said, is far from the truth

Luckily this kind of thing is merely due to the novelty of crypto.  As soon as a new fork or coin becomes old, uninteresting news, this will all die very quickly.

7385 2018-04-07 21:50:35 Couldn’t agree more. Tai zen is even worse! 25k for a 3 day Crypto boot camp lol! Crypto Jake not much better. I’m sure they did very nicely financially. Truly shocking that they only secured nano & trade satoshi exchanges. Fucking disgraceful tbh.
7386 2018-04-07 21:50:32 I can’t see 9200 cracked either, and thats already a stretch.
7387 2018-04-07 21:50:27 Definitely agree. Just looks like we're at the bottom for #TRX. I got in at 530 and don't wanna fuck that up, LOL.
7388 2018-04-07 21:50:17 I’ve recently averaged down on my most solid bags. Admittedly i was “buying the dip” the entire way down. However I think we are about to see some insane gains, possibly more than anyone expects? Korean Jew, what do you think will happen when the institutional money pours in?
7389 2018-04-07 21:50:07 Good and really valuable #crypto projects that are out there are surely the ones that have been supported by VCs and angel investors. If the project is funded only though an ICO you gotta be very sceptical about it

NONE Reports have to be built. Having data =! Having reporting. The kool-aid on crypto must taste really good.
7394 2018-04-07 21:49:15 So said PIVX person in the past had contracted and helped another project.
That other project has control over their own github repo.
Other project didn't properly credit #PIVX.

That still means said project in control of their repo are the ones responsible, no?

7422 2018-04-07 21:44:57 So slowwwww. Unfortunately I dont have time to watch this 40 minute video he lost me with the coffee drinking and ecig smoking. Will keep an eye on it though thanks.
7423 2018-04-07 21:44:00 no sell big...
7424 2018-04-07 21:43:54 they will buy the infrastructure(exchanges) surrounding crypto.
7425 2018-04-07 21:43:42 Investment idea: how much money do you want in 2 years? Divide that by 400, then invest that much money into crypto currency #xrp. I want $1,000,000. To accomplish that I’m buying $2500 worth of $XRP at $0.49 USD each. #milliondollaridea #xrp@$200in2020 #ripple #xrpthestandard
7426 2018-04-07 21:43:41 I'm going to setup a $TEARS masternode. Volume is increasing non stop, any guide? Thanks

7428 2018-04-07 21:42:49 Is this your issue with trading or is this a suggestion? Because buy and hold isn't a trading strategy it's just gambling, and for your thorough research to be sound you'd have to be as good as Warren Buffett at fundamental valuation.
7429 2018-04-07 21:42:47 @Dante25555 The profile shares great content. I wish you continued success. I have good information about Bitcoin, and I believe that it will rise in recent times.

7448 2018-04-07 21:39:30 Just pointing out to people who didn't follow the last few years of crypto history that reputation is important but people make mistakes.

7454 2018-04-07 21:37:54 No it isn't because I never claimed it was all or nothing, that's a false premise. Had you asked me directly  about that I would have told you that not all protesters are paid, that'd be a foolish assertion, equally as foolish as saying no protesters are paid.
7455 2018-04-07 21:37:41 Maybe #TRX is ready for take off right now. 
7456 2018-04-07 21:37:29 Excellent imo. Or is that not profit?  Not arguing. Just these confident predictions are a bit cringe worthy in crypto.

7537 2018-04-07 21:23:31 Plot twist: The Penguins have tech that allows them to just insult you from a distance. Every time you get close they teleport to the other side of the room. The whole time you are with them, they just go "Your hair is dumb." "Your pants look stupid." Over and over. Little jerks.
7538 2018-04-07 21:23:30 I work on about 15 audit engagements every year. They are not that hard to complete.
7539 2018-04-07 21:23:13 That’s almost as dumb as creating a twitter handle beginning with “Crypto-“. They should start the exchange with “Bit-“ instead

7544 2018-04-07 21:22:26 sorry to hear about your experience. 
The market timing of "actively trading" is the difficult and costs most people their investments. 
People say "hold" all the time but what the vets mean is hold great projects that have solid fundamentals and avoid fomo and panic.

And stop using the word "crypto". It is inaccurate and sounds geeky and illegal.

7584 2018-04-07 21:15:52 With the US stock market also performing poorly, liquidity is key.  I think a majority who would invest in crypto is likely “stuck” in hodls that tanked after the gold rush.  Doubling down on that is unlikely, IMHO.

7616 2018-04-07 21:09:01 In my mind I keep things simple. Crypto is about having keys to control a balance on an immutable ledger. Everything else is just a GUI (software or hardware)

7661 2018-04-07 21:00:50 Just found out Poland's the worst possible place to trade crypto. 1% principal charged PER TRADE. Apparently some dude had $50K gains, but owes $1M in taxes. On the flipside, portugal isn't charging tax on crypto gains for a decade.

7663 2018-04-07 21:00:44 Every run that we have had we’ve seen has been sold off what is that saying sellers are in control this is another guppy....Also weekend retail investors wait till monday it retraces all the way back where going down to 5k maybe even lower

7676 2018-04-07 20:59:13 Exactly my thoughts buddy. Confirms he is looking at the crypto market and everyone goes bullish? It’s either neutral or bearish cause we don’t see any bullishness confirmed in the charts.

7678 2018-04-07 20:58:49 This is the end $crypto bubble has popped. Im selling my whole 1 bitcoins on the exchanges longs are about to get liquidated, you better not find yourself on the opposite side.

7680 2018-04-07 20:58:29 And regular markets aren't? I guarantee any crypto market issues are nothing new to Wall Street. Manipulation, insider trading... it comes with the territory of fin markets and should be expected and handled properly by the authorities.

7690 2018-04-07 20:55:37 I am actively buying and selling (don't dare to call it trading) $crypto for roughly 1year now. I am magnitudes higher in usd value (and btc) compared to when I started. I was never rekt. Why? I never did a margin trade.

7721 2018-04-07 20:49:56 But first I need a better Crypto name, but everything sounds too lame for me to decide one.
Maybe one of my favorite video game characters inspire me.
7722 2018-04-07 20:49:44 My money and i cant use it on my own to buy crypto and i think we live in independent india, where is independence. Now Govt will suggest me what to do with my money.
7723 2018-04-07 20:49:39 Don't buy anything while under the influence.

Then again, some of my best crypto plays started out by drinking too much.

7725 2018-04-07 20:49:15 I wish crypto currency mining would go away so I could buy ram or a graphics card for msrp. But that’s just me.

7796 2018-04-07 20:37:37 its already illegal  (age <18) , but once it happened govt by itself can't annulment  the marriage.
earlier it was legal for husband to have sex with girl aged above 15. subclause
Now its illegal 
sex with <18 is statutory rape in any condition
7797 2018-04-07 20:37:23 I feel like he has been in crypto for a while and made good money in the last run and he wants to big short now and shakeout the last weak hands

7808 2018-04-07 20:35:15 Yeah, some of my favorite projects allow ASICS like DCR. But overall I see them as detrimental to the health of a crypto.

Look at DOGE. Millions of $$ of ASICs fighting over $2 per minute. This is the inevitable end to the majority of mining ventures if they allow ASICS to scale

7821 2018-04-07 20:33:24 I think this idea of a global ban is a stretch.. most governments see crypto (for the purpose of this bitcoin has ring signatures) as inevitable and actually benefit tremendously from a global currency- it would create a massive debt slide and the US would be in a 7T surplus

7922 2018-04-07 20:12:44 DocTailor's central goal is to establish the frameworks for this new economy by empowering non-crypto organizations to completely use blockchain innovation, while all the while empowering the quickening of crypto-business.@DocumentTailor

7925 2018-04-07 20:11:43 to summarize: snappy complaining about people intentionally removing Pivx copyright. Me: probably not intentional. Even happened to a coin cloned apparently by a Pivx dev himself
7926 2018-04-07 20:11:42 Real question is why would we want the same centralized bullshit as we have now. Crypto is built for breaking the current financial framework. With ripple we are just giving banks the same control of the population.

7949 2018-04-07 20:08:10 Like it or not, crypto is here to stay. As the market evolves the scammers and fraudsters will be weeded out as regulation is enforced. Until then, we can expect there will some tears along the way.

7952 2018-04-07 20:07:51 @cryptomanran when Soros and Rockefeller get into crypto, I feel a chill in my spine. This has all the signs of a concerted effort to attack the market. They never play in a clear and straightforward manner - expect fireworks in the future when stage 2 kicks in.

7961 2018-04-07 20:06:49 Crypto is a growing market and no clearly defined parameters exist. There is a lot of talk about regulation and governance which is good for establishing a legitimate structure. Good sustainable Business models for various assets which works for diverse industries are required!

7965 2018-04-07 20:06:00 But how will it change the sentiments formthe people who don't know crypto! We need the change there. People who bought crypto are surely going to support it whether they know about it or not.

8037 2018-04-07 19:53:49 Bitcoin has amply demonstrated that it has value at LEAST as 1) an alternative to gold that is far more portable and liquid and 2) via blockchain transaction processing. Speculation in crypto has far outpaced demonstrated use cases, but don't let that fool you about core value.

8057 2018-04-07 19:49:58 Unless you're professional bamboozler (fortune teller) you can't even estimate whats going to be in 3 years. BTC might hit sub 1k, 100k, 1000k or 0 (replaced by new crypto assets) in addition to the tax burden (nsa), safety/legislatory risk and opportunity cost.

8065 2018-04-07 19:48:27 Since Venrock has such impressive success, cryptocurrencies being added  is a huge sign. They’ve done their research and have found crypto to be a  huge space in the future. This is an extremely bullish sign.

8087 2018-04-07 19:44:09 Haha this guy. What a sell out
8088 2018-04-07 19:44:03 He does contract work and is one of the biggest contributors to PIVX and many other coins. The code is open source, perfectly fine. Whats your point?
8089 2018-04-07 19:43:59 Exactly. Not even close to a big enough reward to short now.

8093 2018-04-07 19:43:03 The point is not that they don’t wish to speak to him (no one is forcing them to) but rather they wish to de-platform him at public events (ignoring their own conflicts of interest in doing so as he is competition.)

8113 2018-04-07 19:40:39 Your delusional if you think Soros is just getting into crypto now. He was accumulating for a long time and is part of the reason for the fall from ATH in December/January. He has been shorting the whole way down.

8115 2018-04-07 19:40:23 Don't forget to diversify your investments in crypto. When one investment is not yielding what you expect, reduce your risk by spreading your money across different crypto investments. The ways I invest are: trading, altcoin HODL, bot trade, ICOs, and staking.

8143 2018-04-07 19:36:28 That bird has a taste! Great hats maestro! :)

I like what I see. Only downside is that my long is very small right now. Expected a little lower double bottom and missed it for 50 points... Right now 8.4 seems hard, but we will see after 7.5 falls.

8185 2018-04-07 19:32:10 हम लोग सरकार से कोई काम नही मांग रहे है! हम crypto currency मे आपना करिअर बनाना चहाते है लेकीन सरकार और RBI मिलकर हमारा करिअर छीन रहे हैं, क्या ऐसें बनेगा digital India... देश की तरक्की मत रोकीए... crypto को legal किजीए..

8187 2018-04-07 19:32:08 Hey guys, thanks for bringing this to my attention. I'm not sure what's causing that - maybe the twitter clampdown on ICO / crypto advertising. I reported this to Twitter and hopefully it gets fixed ASAP. 

The link is the correct one and does not take you to a phishing website.
8188 2018-04-07 19:32:02 Simple, Clean and transparent update. Thank you @XTRABYTES team!!
Few important points are.
1. New Website
2. Team Expansion
3. Development on track
4. Project Expansion for Japeness & Chiness market.
5. Community expansion
6. Massive Giveaway coming

8192 2018-04-07 19:31:43 That was basically my first thought about Institutional Money coming in.
The world is looking for 'unexplored' assets -> crypto -> then you want to use it, but doesn't have the liquidity they need and too volatile. How to solve? Make it big enough that 1k usd moves r nothing...

8212 2018-04-07 19:29:21 In all fairness, all crypto coins are looking to further their publicity (both negatively and positively) to reinforce their propositions for future intentions , just as almost any business. It is our job to weave out the ugly and obtain the necessary.

8222 2018-04-07 19:27:58 Yeah, it can be. I'm getting an MBA but the development of crypto has caused growth and glad to be a small part of it, hopefully many people can use blockchain apps, dapps and its benefits efficiently.
8223 2018-04-07 19:27:44 World's most countries are regularsing crypto... And rbi india doing opposite... You are doing everything which is for loss of peoples... Monetory / opportunity regulate it we are ready to pay texes just dont ban it please.

8231 2018-04-07 19:26:45 Is it crypto advertisement ban or ICO ban? I would think it's a good thing because the majority of the ICOs are scams. There is one, where after fleecing the public, they left a phallus image on their homepage
8232 2018-04-07 19:26:33 Additional problem: estimated taxes paid quarterly. Many crypto hodlers never paid est. taxes unless they held way back in 2014. Big gains will be realized for selling of $BCH in Aug, due to gains transitioning to long term with $0 basis. Drag due to taxes will linger into '19.

It's a whitepaper. Not an eighth grade book report. Fluff doesn't play.

8306 2018-04-07 19:15:04 Jeez, just read some background about Soros, that guy is evil.. But I doubt he will get into crypto now to short it, he probably already shorted when he called it a bubble and now announcing he is getting into crypto is rather to long it at first.

8322 2018-04-07 19:12:54 There is a correlation between the stock market and crypto, so unless things change, I don't see any changes.

I'm not investing in any crypto until I figure out whether we are doing a tariff war with china, and you should be smart to do the same.

8331 2018-04-07 19:11:35 yes, but then all "the experts" will say: Blockchain? This is that Crypto-Witchcraft-Thing. Must be safe.
8332 2018-04-07 19:11:07 The psychology doesn’t make sense. If I was getting $500 refund and going to spend it on crypto why not just but it now?

8350 2018-04-07 19:07:39 @thecyberwire love your show. However, today was terrible: crypto crumple is just a bad idea. Bad guys have resources too! The tech community needs to band together that real encryption is necessary for all! These guys are giving FBI Wray hope.
8351 2018-04-07 19:07:09 Thought for @carterthomas @CryptoChoe @CryptoEthan and @crypto_bobby what if Soros is thinking BTC and crypto will pump, replacing third world currencies and causing them to dump? letting him short fiat even more and do what he’s done forever. Aka using crypto as a tool? Hmm

8364 2018-04-07 19:04:33 RBI identifies blockchain's potential but indirectly bans crypto thru ring fencing of banks. Can crypto be separated from blockchain? Is it not the enabler of the current innovations of blockchain? @maxkeiser @VentureCoinist @aantonop @VinnyLingham @TimDraper @iam_preethi

8375 2018-04-07 19:03:24 1/George Soros' fund set to start trading crypto, a lot of people are blowing the news out of proportion as usual, it's being chalked up as more bullish than it actually is. Yes, it is true that George Soros is a billionaire but that does not necessarily mean his fund is ready...

Between him thinking that BTC is the only viable crypto along with his "Lambo" header picture - tells me all I need to know about him.
8388 2018-04-07 19:01:33 I think this is retarded thinking, just another way for people to justify why the market is correcting. Can we just all admit it all went up way to fast, so now we need to cool off and consolidate. Also we need real world  use cases for BTC and other crypto.

8424 2018-04-07 18:55:41 Winner for now.  What’s PP’s bank/bal mix these days. With crypto coming V/MC share should see a challenge. PP’s beauty is that it can add methods as they become popular.

8434 2018-04-07 18:54:46 Agreed on the semis, but I feel like people are less focused on the whole crypto asset group now.
8435 2018-04-07 18:54:39 Very few people actually need crypto. 100% adoption will mean the average person will use crypto a couple times a year best case scenario. That would perhaps justify a $50 billion global crypto market cap.

8468 2018-04-07 18:49:43 yes. At the inception the creators owned 100% of all circulating supply. Just like every other crypto. But if they gave the majority to Ripple then they can’t hold over half still.

so far I have reached out around 200 people in the crypto scene, which is great! Time to say thank you and to level up in the game. Crypto is super-fast and cycles repeat within a short time frame which allows us to learn very fast.

8491 2018-04-07 18:46:39 He also talks about how hot he’s doing with crypto currencies but won’t show you his balance sheets or any proof
8492 2018-04-07 18:46:34 Great poll. Would you say your following is largely investors/traders most likely already in crypto? 

Would love if we could extrapolate these sentiments towards the greater American public, but idk. Too much uncertainty in the reg markets atm w/ the cost of goods increasing.
8493 2018-04-07 18:46:22 So, crypto currency not as hot as we all thought it would be any more, eh?

8544 2018-04-07 18:38:14 If you have realised gains to pay but assets that are currently at a loss then selling and rebuying the assets realises their current loss which is subtracted from the previously realised gains which thus reduces the tax payable.

8561 2018-04-07 18:36:26 There is such a thing. Some coins comprise securities, and insider trading could trigger 10b-5 violations and possible SEC enforcement (and private suits); also under Rule 180.1 the CFTC can pursue insider trading in (crypto) derivatives and commodities in interstate commerce.

Spain’s Tax Agency has asked financial firms to turn over names and trading data on cryptocurrency buyers, launching the country’s biggest dragnet yet for potential tax evasion and money laundering using digital coins.

8695 2018-04-07 18:19:29 How much will be the blocks size to have 280k tx/sec? I answer: too much. DGB is a great coin and the one of the few crypto that can survive in the future, but the increase of the block size isn't the solution for the scaling.
There are advantages but also disadvantages. IMHO.
8696 2018-04-07 18:19:28 Majority of the countries are planing to bring regulation in this field. My opinion is India should take a lead to regulate crypto asset rather than blanket ban. By doing this we will have opportunities in the future such as tax , more blockchain realted jobs etc #isupportcrypto

8997 2018-04-07 17:39:57 What Jerry said plus ease of use and regulatory. 1) Coinbase built a crypto platform for regular people not crypto-heads. No need to understand the ins and outs of crypto. Just buy and sell. 2) they are one of the only US-compliant exchanges

9000 2018-04-07 17:39:46 Worst Financial move of the year would be to sell #cryptocurrency to pay taxes. Better off selling stock, by far. Stocks, at this point, will not go UP 5x, but, crypto will, and, 3x(Alts), is conservative. 10x, 20x, 50x, all very possible.

9006 2018-04-07 17:38:58 Me, 6 months ago: The #TTC must be amazing as its so extensive and serves a dense, diverse urban hub.

9213 2018-04-07 17:16:06 #isupportcrypto crypto currency should be legalise in india and it is future as so many people life depend on it 
All crypto lover are against RBI decision
9214 2018-04-07 17:16:03 I don’t get how alcohol is legal but weed not. Bump into someone drunk it’s a fight, bump into someone smoking it’s all love. Causes a lot of hate & anger & our accident & emergency rooms are filled on a weekend night with drunks, it’s never people who have smoked a joint.
9215 2018-04-07 17:15:53 Don't you think RBI has bigger pockets than newly minted crypto entrepreneurs? They might be able to buy judges at the court (since judges are usually corrupt). Do you disagree?

We understand RBI care about our money and stable financial system and think about unemployment 
But before banning crypto please bring back the money which has taken from the banks by businessmans and run away from country.

9301 2018-04-07 17:07:40 Agree
9302 2018-04-07 17:07:33 Also think that if you are going to marry someone that you should know their positions, not avoid it because it's unpleasant. No one agrees on everything, but if you have strong feelings, hiding them doesn't work.

9318 2018-04-07 17:06:16 He calls himself “Crypo Analysis”. Only thing he is probably doing is tweeting bulls*** all day long....
9319 2018-04-07 17:05:59 i sort of like Discord but the amount of channels you need to mute for crypto coins is huge. One for every friggin language plus others. Small coins that think they’ll be universal are a bit scammy
9320 2018-04-07 17:05:57 True, takes time to learn this lesson for new traders tho. Or for everyone who comes to crypto to get rich quick. You can get easily burned.

9340 2018-04-07 17:04:31 For evidence of bad faith in "going dark", read the OIG report regarding unlocking the San Bernardino attacker's iPhone. For crypto, look at the NSA subverting NIST in designing Dual_EC_DRBG and subsequent attempts to weaken TLS (e.g., extended random).

9343 2018-04-07 17:04:25 That’s my thought too, unless this is a 9-12 month bear market.  This BTC market may redefine what we call corrections in the crypto space going forward.  Using my psychological indicators along with the calendar we could be seeing a bottom.  I’m long so I’m biased

9373 2018-04-07 17:01:30 They can't ban either since most Indian crypto traders can bypass the ban easily. Million dollar local exchange business will get shut, and governments will lose capital gains tax. Yes, we are ruled by dimwits in India and are headed backwards.

9481 2018-04-07 16:51:12 You predicted the drop at $19k? What I'm saying is that excluding the last quarter nothing has outperformed crypto as an investment. It is silly to say I told you so on the back of a poor quarter when over the year that asset you mentioned performed much worse than Crypto.

9520 2018-04-07 16:45:47 This is a key insight. The deflationary tendencies of crypto currencies results in the creation of new blockchains/currencies. Expansion through parallel deflating currencies. Unanticipated consequences totally defeating original intent.

9551 2018-04-07 16:42:01 Which is the truth. Most ICOs are money sinks.

9614 2018-04-07 16:34:41 The guarantee of decentralization in crypto was always a facade. The 51% issue was always a real fear. I believe at present, bill gates could buy bitcoin. Like all of bitcoin. Then it’s centralized. Without maximum stake provisions this was inevitable. I want to make money
9615 2018-04-07 16:34:33 Agree with you there. The market is definitely being manipulated. Best not to use leverage/margin right now IMHO as you need to be able to hold long term if required. There’s a fundamental mismatch in duration between crypto and margin.
9616 2018-04-07 16:34:16 But as always make love not war. Remember why we are in crypto is to change the world..
9617 2018-04-07 16:34:05 Not to be a dlck but you don’t really give any crypto advice you’d have to research.   It’s just memes and FF’ing.

9623 2018-04-07 16:33:12 Learned a lot today about the coins that are "contenders" as opposed to the "pretenders" the coins that will be here after the bubble. The amazon's and facebook's of the space. #realestatewealthexpo #bitcoin #crypto
9624 2018-04-07 16:33:07 Maybe so.  But what if he looks at crypto as the biggest short opportunity since he "broke the British pound?" Trading opportunities work both ways.

9671 2018-04-07 16:28:53 how do they coordinate pumps amongst exchanges ? How many BTC does this require  ( for the 5 or 10 biggest exchanges ? any idea ?
9672 2018-04-07 16:28:44 A Pump creates attention, 

Attention creates a gold rush, 

Gold Rush creates bag holders, 

Bag holders create community,

9760 2018-04-07 16:20:42 I believe the massive bubble was created due to the ICO craze. People buy BTC and ETH for ICOs. When SEC stepping in the fever cooled down and demand reduced. It only makes sense the price go back to the same level. Aligns with poop's numbers.

9981 2018-04-07 15:58:16 There's a 7 coin interval in there. The banks and funds will attempt to make bagholders out of retail and even savvy traders. If their fear of the coin is less than their FOMO, their best option is to try to destroy it. I suspect they're too late though.

9989 2018-04-07 15:57:22 I disagree with the demonization of fee based crypto protocols. I think properly designed fee structures allow the network token to capture the scalable value of the service provided to users. There is a non-zero fee that captures value while minimizing the risk of a fork.

10026 2018-04-07 15:54:08 I have nothing against bfx, and tbh their platform is way better then kraken. Tether’s risk to the crypto ecosystem cannot be ignored. Even if tether is 100% legit, backed and by the book - it won’t save them from the U.S govt who will eventually take action.
