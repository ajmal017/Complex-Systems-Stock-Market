obviously it happens but not 90%

2 2018-03-24 23:40:24 Are you thinking commodities break resistance and rally hard?
3 2018-03-24 23:33:13 No reason to see $WTIC selling off if equities resume upward. A more important issue is the $USD. If that fails to hold the $DXY 88s... then it'd be monstrously bullish for commodities, esp' $WTIC and $gold.

6 2018-03-24 23:02:56 It's not difficult to see why it turned into a corrupt system, kids became commodities. I've suspicions about foster care system, £450 a month per child...multiple children, more money instead of it being about care it may be about money
7 2018-03-24 23:02:12 Someone (other than Roger) needs to run a 20 year history on 'the creeps' - function creep, access creep, collection creep, etc. and all the lies we were told. The predictions were spot on. Data is combined and mined. We are ALL commodities now.

10 2018-03-24 22:25:33 Thanks Greg! So helpful for you to update your rabble on the Yen as of close Friday. It matters Bigly these days for commodities followers. A new cycle beginning has to be near for 2018.

15 2018-03-24 21:36:17 It amazes me that talking heads declare fear of trade war with China. Are they so daft not to realize we are already in a trade war. What do you call theft of intellectual property, currency manipulation and commodities dumping?

I fear lack of defense and overwhelming timidity.

34 2018-03-24 20:55:43 and hopefully we’re not using our throwaway/custom solutions as commodities/utilities to build new solutions on top of (or at least, we are keeping our tower of cards in proportion to how much humans can swarm on the complexity of it all)
35 2018-03-24 20:49:54 Okay.... if our technical debt is because we are exploring how to create value, we are hopefully aware of, and not duplicating, commodities
36 2018-03-24 20:49:47 That’s just rubbish. World commodities are priced in $$ . If you take out Rotterdam affect EU trade is 30% ish so we trade more with ROW . I hired remain but get annoyed with those who make up crap.
37 2018-03-24 20:21:10 We Indians ( some of us ,) says about  using indegenous things  ( all tangible n intangible commodities ) through fb ; Twitter ; Chrome; youtube; foreign ideas ; english lang. Still India is surviving n always will ( paradox?!! Hehe jai bahrat màa
38 2018-03-24 20:20:43 While the potential for further market sell off exists, I think that a lot of the selling is a result of sector rotation/capital flows.

-foreign equities holding up better than domestic
-commodities outperforming
-dollar getting dumped

41 2018-03-24 20:03:25 But finance , stocks, ETF’s, bonds and commodities is more of an passion.
42 2018-03-24 19:54:55 I look at the example of Quaker Oats. Why a Quaker on the box? WTF is special about Quakers? The prevailing belief was that Quakers were honest traders, thus commodities like oats, are better from Quakers. Is that Quaker privilege? Or is it a natural consequence of a stereotype?
43 2018-03-24 19:54:15 Soft? Absolutely. However, it’s still smart. These young guys are the only commodities the Lakers have. They have to protect them, and they must believe that the young guys have shown enough to attract top talent, otherwise I think they would run them out there injured.

47 2018-03-24 19:30:08 While the same people still lack basic commodities,  misplaced priorities
48 2018-03-24 19:29:02 The way to make a small fortune in the commodities market is to start
with a large fortune.
49 2018-03-24 19:02:48 The SEC has stated that exchanges _that list securities_ are under their purview and require registration. Exchanges that do NOT list securities, only trading crypto assets deemed commodities, are NOT under their jurisdiction.
50 2018-03-24 19:00:30 The gifts of the Spirit are not novelties for Sunday morning personal entertainment, commodities to build a spiritual resume/ego, nor a fix for your need to be emotionally stimulated. They are the concrete evidences of Jesus in resurrection, designed to meet needs in others.
51 2018-03-24 18:58:36 Above that, increasing of salaries it's not a solution within the context of Zimbabwe. Better slash down the prices of commodities. If salaries are increased, prices of basics will follow suit. Ngatishandei nezviripo
52 2018-03-24 18:50:12 Who's gonna consume all the materialism being produced by Chinese manufacturing complex. It's not the 800,000 taoist farmers in greater China. = debt implosion, commodities,  rebar already collapsing last few

55 2018-03-24 18:27:12 More armed security is a must if we are talking about defending our most precious commodities such as children, and a civilian with no track record should be allowed to keep, carry, and purchase firearms.
56 2018-03-24 18:24:01 120 million people are victims of high value!!
Prices of some essential commodities, including rice, have risen in 2017. Despite the increase in the per capita income in the country last year, it has not received any benefit of 12 million people of low and middle income!
57 2018-03-24 18:13:01 The sharp rise Friday with gold n crude oil ( highest close since June ‘15) hints loudly commodities per se will rally early this week.
58 2018-03-24 18:12:56 Iagree wit u 200day has tohold but i conversely believe itwill. These cycles in commodities tend to last foryears not months. And metals are the key piece to the puzzle. Look at the historical chart on X. Huge downtrend just reversed 2016. Longs can easily double or triple again
59 2018-03-24 18:07:47 (Those below-market prices are how China is able to flood marketplaces with cheaper commodities & goods to crush their competitors’ companies & to destabilize & destroy the economies of entire countries.)
60 2018-03-24 18:03:48 —Void contracts (& ban future contacts—and the resulting commodity imports/exports) between China & companies/countries for China’s purchases of commodities at below-market prices for 15-35 years in exchange for China’s investing in those struggling companies/countries.

62 2018-03-24 17:58:54 the U.S. has the largest standing army in the world, making  the 2nd A an anachronism. In 2018, no civilian is, or ever will be, part of a well regulated militia, hence, the right to bear arms is not sacrosanct and guns should be regulated like all other dangerous commodities.
63 2018-03-24 17:58:14 What is 
Now 
New reality 
It’s all Triviality 
Commodities
Enter in if you please
64 2018-03-24 17:56:45 Government regulations. Anti everything governments. Plain and simple. Can’t blame the price of commodities as these companies are investing elsewhere for the same commodities.
65 2018-03-24 17:56:18 As Keith law preaches, outs are precious commodities. Love aggression. But understand the math.
66 2018-03-24 17:52:28 I m your fan but not subscriber because in India we can't trade these forex paires. We can trade Only commodities on mcx India.
67 2018-03-24 17:43:41 nothing wrong with wages. Atrocious is the cost of living,which includes car insurance,property tax&prices of all commodities 
A litre of gas is 1.60
A full car insurance is at avg 300 bucks 
Bread at 3 dollars.
Activists like you should target this rather than wages
68 2018-03-24 17:31:25 Even if its harare it wil work. Demand and supply. Chamisa mentioned a commodities market. As long as u can airlift tomatoes to hre and still supply them at their value in harare and make a profit then it wont fail. Greece supplies UAE with tomatoes, a 5000km journey. Wat is hre?
69 2018-03-24 17:29:16 Idk do I look like some sort of commodities trader? 
70 2018-03-24 17:21:03 I’m just trying to figure out what you mean by it. What are its elements? Is trading of commodities sufficient to be called capitalism?
71 2018-03-24 17:18:09 Teck was a past holding of mine, I don't mind it as it's diversified with coal, copper and a few other commodities.  But volatile as heck.
Seems like the most stable play is Franco-Nevada, but mostly a copper/gold play.. Most these equities are so volatile that I would hold a few
72 2018-03-24 17:13:01 Enter a bracketed sell order on agricultural commodities using Forex pivot points to minimize the effects of impact costs.
73 2018-03-24 16:58:02 Seria bueno encarar seriamente la economía y la política y no engañar a mucha gente. Ningún gobierno de ningún partido político fija los precios internacionales de los commodities, razón fundamental del crecimiento de los últimos 15 años.
74 2018-03-24 16:57:01 Pues bajo esa lógica no, nuevamente son peras y manzanas. Las condiciones políticas, económicas, sociales y tecnológicas son diferentes. Singapore se ha desarrollado con el comercio y la manufactura, aquí explotacion de recursos para la oferta de commodities (sin valor agregado).
75 2018-03-24 16:46:19 Existem exceções (países com petróleo e outros surtos de commodities), mas em geral é um bom indicador sim. Pobreza medida só por renda e pobreza multidimensional são altamente correlacionadas.
76 2018-03-24 16:37:00 I'm on board with the $100k idea. I assume we may be entering a huge global recession and BTC/gold/silver/other commodities will surge. Couple that with the potential death of the petrodollar and $100k then won't be today's $100k.
77 2018-03-24 16:19:04 BitNautic acts as a market for goods and commodities where importers, exporters, end-consumers and producers are available to trade their products and facilitate their trading practices around the world. #bitnautic
78 2018-03-24 15:57:42 This paper proposes developed market solutions to the problem. It fails to  identify what it is about poor economies that makes them fragile and possess negative convexity cf. @nntaleb High leverage, poor property rights, corruption, reliance on commodities can all be factors.
79 2018-03-24 15:47:20 Wrong priorities, the most important mega deal he shld have motioned was to secure cash and make it available in banks, this would have brought down the prices of basic commodities, then deal with the dilapidated health service....
80 2018-03-24 15:46:59 #Somalia is already a dumping ground for finished goods & commodities.  It also lacks established secondary industries & skilled labour markets.  More importantly, the country's borders are porous & unprotected.
81 2018-03-24 15:43:52 At least prices are stabilised . Otherwise hoarders would have jacked up the day today commodities price by hoarding using  this black money . Black money lovers never appreciate demonetization
82 2018-03-24 15:36:09 Fabulous, I like it & everybody  looking for value added to original products and commodities
83 2018-03-24 15:33:33 S una bajeza total, comparar cualquier país q dependa d commodities con modelo venezolano; ni Irán una economía tan aislada llega a parecerse a Venezuela, pq dntro d toda su ley sharia dejan a la gente trabajar, respetan la tenencia d la tierra y la inversión
84 2018-03-24 15:33:16 ED must close mega deal that can be visible on the ground, we dont want paper deals that dont yield results, still basic commodities are unaffordable to many, its a struggle to get your money from the bank, unemployment is high if not higher, docs are on strike. ED must wake up.
85 2018-03-24 15:31:28 The market is very effective in that transitional stage of products but tends to fall down with commodities that are infrastructural. If you're needing to create an "artificial" market then it's a pretty strong signal that a market approach doesn't work.
86 2018-03-24 15:30:57 Es q les llenan la cabeza d porquerias; no saben q el modelo económico dependa o no d commodities s viable siempre y cuando c respete la propiedad privada, la inversión, exista libre convertibilidad monetaria, precios desregulados y sector privado fortalecido
87 2018-03-24 15:29:05 Infrastructural commodities (as opposed to products) such as broadband, power, water, health etc are not well suited to "artificial" markets which discount the future. This always tends towards rent seeking and has longer term competitive impacts for other industries.
88 2018-03-24 15:27:13 Yes, I hear all the Fintech and Innovation drive and ginger in FSI. But the products that banks offer [retail] customers around here are still commodities/basics. Visit a US/Dubai bank's website and you will wonder whether they should be called banks - interest rates aside.

92 2018-03-24 15:01:49 Correct. Commodities futures are paper instruments that are treated the same as physical assets even though they are nearly(>90%) speculative
93 2018-03-24 15:01:36 Rare commodities are worth more than good
94 2018-03-24 15:00:26 Trump seems to offer money by way of apology for poor performance as well as viewing women as commodities.
95 2018-03-24 14:41:28 What about buyers who buy with the intention of using the token in the future when the platform launches? Seems to me early data would look like securities and over time it would transition to commodities as more dapps come online.
96 2018-03-24 14:38:00 Let me get this straight,  you are calling the people who opposed Hillary for touting Gramm-Leach-Billy, Commodities Futures modernization act, telecommunications act of 96, NAFTA, CTPA, TPP, TiSA, the 96 crime bill,  and "wellfare reform" blue dogs? LMAO that's some serious spin
97 2018-03-24 14:33:21 Here's another one calling Bernie supporters blue dogs, when they opposed Hillary because she touted, Gramm-Leach-Billy, Commodities Futures modernization act, telecommunications act of 96, NAFTA, TPP, and "welfare reform" all policies favored by blue dogs.
98 2018-03-24 14:31:21 Way before this "lived experience" thing took off I've noticed these patterns when discussing humans as almost as if they were commodities.
99 2018-03-24 14:30:13 Mr President Bail is NOT a procedure it is a right .Peoples rights are not market place commodities or subject to customer satisfaction..
100 2018-03-24 14:28:33 The journos on the field and in the studio ought to comprehend basic fact that seats at the Rajya Sabha and the slots of awards are like scarce commodities. Such goods are rationed, and the cut-throat competition is not warranted. Goodwill an abundant good, Earn it @rssurjewala
101 2018-03-24 14:23:38 Thanks.  As I keep trying to argue, the ultimate goal is to ensure universities cannot treat young people as commodities.  (As someone who worked his way through school and now teaches, I am committed to a certain way of viewing students.)
102 2018-03-24 14:21:49 About BitNautic: Acts as a marketplace for goods and commodities, where importers, exporters, end-consumer and producers of goods will be able to trade their products and ease their trading practices all over the globe. #Bitnautic
103 2018-03-24 14:10:14 A thought on how you turn Putin into Yanukovich:

47% of Russia’s exports are crude oil, nat gas & minerals. If we use a lot more renewable energy, the price of those commodities will fall sharply. It will bankrupt the Oligarchy & they’ll reach out to the west. Aka buh-bye Putin.
104 2018-03-24 14:02:46 It’s the norm. These animals aren’t animals to them, they’re commodities.
105 2018-03-24 14:01:10 Also depends if you see the land and water as living or consumable commodities
106 2018-03-24 13:57:28 At least if I'm going to be semi-snowed in the markets could be open so id have something to do. I'm a piss poor excuse of a shade tree commodities trader but still a helluva lot less ass kickings taken there than playing Xbox shooter games with my kids. Think ill watch for a bit
107 2018-03-24 13:56:42 People have to stand up to the NRA and militia groups and make them aware that young lives or any lives lost just so they can own an AR-15 will not be tolerated any longer.  People are not commodities for the protection of their 2nd Amendment Rights.
108 2018-03-24 13:48:39 Also an excellent idea. If universities are going to treat youth (particularly of color) as commodities, I feel they have a responsibility to those same youth.

I enjoyed the read no less!
109 2018-03-24 13:35:48 If your local shopping area has more pubs than other shops for every day commodities & necessary items, then the community around is doomed

111 2018-03-24 13:14:43 I just wanted to cite how knowledge is transformed into technical nkow how, Services that lead to economic diversification and not solely depending on commodities that tend to have ups and down
112 2018-03-24 13:09:26 Time . The most precious of all commodities and the Brits robbed that too .
113 2018-03-24 13:05:12 "Farm income across commodities has fallen by about 50 percent over the past four years. Retaliation in the trade arena makes our outlook even worse. This could not be happening at a worse time for American agriculture." - @ZippyDuvall
114 2018-03-24 12:55:41 Intent doesn't define the asset class. Industrial gold& diamonds are commodities the same as jewelry gold & diamonds. Same for oil, fojc, gold, corn etc.
115 2018-03-24 12:41:37 I think sentiment is US could go QE route and that boost commodities,  which lead to higher CAD. Also Aramco IPO can lift oil prices. However at the end this all will fade

119 2018-03-24 11:20:29 Australia supplies China with raw materials eg iron ore coal natural gas etc......trade war will mean less demand for commodities and lower commodity based currencies...

122 2018-03-24 10:20:18 Guessing here, but the Military is already paid to do the job and don't get extra money to do those tasks but instead are allocated "commodities" or hours to do task regarding non military personnel such as Tribunals?

126 2018-03-24 09:24:40 Just because a person is disabled or socially awkward does not mean they have the right to treat women as commodities.
127 2018-03-24 09:18:22 You put their needs first, because there’s no produce from an unhealthy animal, and therefore no profit. 

You don’t farm these animals for companionship, they are your commodities.

131 2018-03-24 08:50:16 Hahaha. I assume you’re joking.
But let’s bite, would this “rule” apply to all commodities as well? If someone buys coffee on a mercantile exchange, must we check if it was bought as a “security vs. a commodity”?
132 2018-03-24 08:03:17 What middle class & poor expect from the govt is suitable rates for the agricultural commodities /crops ,insurance coverage for any loss due to natural calamities, good education , medicines & better treatment at affordable price .

Desperdiciamos la década de commodities caras con populismo. Ahora desperdiciamos la del crédito barato endeudándonos para hacer populismo. El populismo hace desperdiciar todas las oportunidades.
136 2018-03-24 07:37:27 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
137 2018-03-24 07:36:01 This is insanity from a legal aspect though. The ability to create a "bright line" test to identify a security vs commodities becomes impossible if the buyer's intention is at question for every purchase.

143 2018-03-24 05:58:59 The Tories think in the guise of “commodities”- Education is a commodity,welfare(card),Detention etc. This allows “user pay” and profit
144 2018-03-24 05:35:00 Sir, those commodities are being paid for and not used freely unlike tax revenue allocation and this issue is not a politically divisive argument and in fact was raised by Gov Gen Rajagopachari and Field Marshal Carriapa
145 2018-03-24 05:17:55 At the time of the original 10 the founders(also slave owners) never thought of slave as men or even people for that matter. They were commodities/possessions. Like cattle & furniture.

Or we could stop treating humans like commodities to exploit so they seek to self medicate.  But, ok.

154 2018-03-24 03:11:09 are we being made into  commodities?
155 2018-03-24 02:56:49 If you work a salary job which under the tax code is called earned income the government is going to tax the hell out of you. If you own stock, buy or sell commodities, invest in real estate which is called unearned income under the tax code, you're taxed at a lower rate.
156 2018-03-24 02:49:59 The NFL is not a Brave Group. They protect “Deadbeat  Dads” and”Wife Beaters” and treat their “players” like commodities. It is very aggravating to try and get them to “Do the  Right Thing” So do not count on them to do Right
157 2018-03-24 02:49:07 Those of you looking to market yourselves or products, take a lesson from the companies that made themselves commodities. "Good moms take care of their babies. Great moms use Johnson's Baby Powder." or "Choosy moms choose JIF Peanut Butter".
158 2018-03-24 02:32:04 Best time to invest is when prices are low. High oil prices increase the cost of all other commodities such as steel.

174 2018-03-24 00:44:19 @halfspoon_com thank you for pointing that out. investment in art, somewhat similarly to investments in commodities such as gold and diamonds, often portends a deep uncertainty and skepticism among wealthy investors. hmmm, could we be at a tipping point in this exuberant market?

235 2018-03-25 20:03:44 We give enough with carbon tax and other BS taxes on gas and other commodities... no ones turning their lights out

237 2018-03-25 19:30:10 I hope lift capabilities get much cheaper soon. That way we can have space based agriculture, and have more than 1 earth of production. That and garbage goes up, commodities coming down.
238 2018-03-25 19:12:55 Atacar a las gestiones anteriores ya han demostrado que no funcionan, cada periodo tiene sus aciertos y desaciertos, depende de la coyuntura, sobretodo en un país que depende de los commodities, sin embargo, sería bueno compararlas objetivamente.
239 2018-03-25 19:01:01 The way these brokers talk, one may think they deal with cars and not HUMANS! It's unfortunate that these women have been turned into commodities whose value is as low as 20,000!!!!

240 2018-03-25 18:59:23 yup. agreed here. i'm more of a macro guy (commodities and portfolio strategy background), and i really do see one last shake-out. I believe that's what's needed (inverse hopium?) before price can move forward, rather than sideways.

245 2018-03-25 18:38:10 There are some at the FAO but focused more on commodities such as barley, rather than the rights of farmers or farm workers.
246 2018-03-25 18:34:04 Bajaron los precios de los commodities y todos esos números bonitos que vendían empiezan a desvanecerse. Y ni siquiera confío 100% en los números que venden, inflación 7.1%? Si, claro.
Publicaron que no importamos más energía y ahora parece que en el verano Argentina nos vendió.
247 2018-03-25 17:39:07 120 million people are victims of high value!!
Prices of some essential commodities, including rice, have risen in 2017. Despite the increase in the per capita income in the country last year, it has not received any benefit of 12 million people of low and middle income!

257 2018-03-25 16:42:32 All of crypto, which includes both digital services/companies AND digital COMMODITIES, is worth less than individual corps. on stock market. At the same time, internet platforms grow VERY fast (Facebook, google, etc.. and crypto) + command very high P/E ratios. Let that sink in.
258 2018-03-25 16:42:31 The amount of cash invested in creating fake commodities in KE is breathtaking. You'd be very mediocre if you created substandard replicas in this industry. The only way you'd know a fake today, is if someone told you.

266 2018-03-25 16:18:24 one rate will mean a higher rate say 18% you  want to pay 18% on basics like steel, cement, flour,spices, not simple it is stupid! forget the ghost of Indira, charge more where you can so that you can cross subsidise where needed  (esselcian commodities) that is good economics!!!

Don't just hike prices. Esp When selling commodities. 

A #brand is not value. A brand derives value from what it offers. Offer value.

277 2018-03-25 15:23:14 There was a time when humans traded humans like livestock, shaded them like veggies waiting to be sold. In the eyes of the slavers, these other humans were commodities, properties and nothing less.

286 2018-03-25 14:13:59 $copper is a key commodity to track. Those equity bears seeking far lower levels, should have eyes on whether copper settles March < or > $3.00. Yours truly is still leaning bullish commodities (esp' metals & oil) into summer. If correct, implications for miners/main market.
287 2018-03-25 14:00:04 Of course they could look for other growth opportunities beyond Land, labour and commodities. Maybe it’s high time they take into our educated folks for innovation. Or cultural & moral shift and create a mini Amsterdam where anything goes, and tape into immoral tourism.

295 2018-03-25 13:26:32 What this gentleman doesn't take into account of that 72 percent of land holdings are marginal. They have very low bargaining power and low margin. They have to produce assured crops. Extension of rational msp to all essential commodities is the key

302 2018-03-25 12:59:54 Seems you dont trade any asset classes because sideways ranging is what mostly all currencies and commodities do. Just trade gold for a couple years and you will learn how to utilise the sideways momentum, it requires leverage and a trading plan.

310 2018-03-25 12:19:52 Commodities are looking particularly bullish to me. Oil is looking more-and-more like it's in a Wave 3 to the upside and with the USD likely putting in it's 15.6 year cycle top (commodity cycle bottom), I really like CAD here technically.

316 2018-03-25 11:08:46 My point is the popular opinion has been driven by govt agents (& now Dangote) making the claims that domestic refining solves all ills. As you’ve both pointed out, that’s a myth.

More fundamentally, the FG will NOT be absorbing any losses as demonstrated with other commodities.

319 2018-03-25 10:35:30 I don’t think its ever been about the dollars saved. The FG has always been willing to allow Nigerians pay a local premium for commodities as long as production was “domesticated”. Look at Cement, Rice, etc. In this case it just allows them to do the same with petroleum products.
320 2018-03-25 10:26:26 Because you have currently free housing, food and other commodities paid for you.

321 2018-03-25 10:23:27 "Capital is money, capital is commodities. By virtue of it being value, it has acquired the occult ability to add value to itself. It brings forth living offspring, or, at the least, lays golden eggs."

328 2018-03-25 09:47:47 And that’s leaving out very necessary asset and transaction taxes: QE allowed the mega wealthy to profit even more from asset reflation - ie switching into oil, gold, metals and other commodities, without any tax capture.
329 2018-03-25 09:29:28 Did the CIPD survey people who are routinely exploited as a "reserve army of labour", e.g in production assembly roles where the employer feels able to treat workers as simple commodities to be used and discarded to suit their order books?

355 2018-03-25 04:47:17 paper, chemicals, commodities supply squeeze
air purifiers, membranes, washeries, electrostatic precipitators - demand side
356 2018-03-25 04:41:30 They do not have the right to do so. We've decided that, as humans, we are so superior to other animals that we feel entitled to treat them as commodities despite their sentience.
357 2018-03-25 04:28:59 Do business people who annually sell 7 figures worth of commodities  follow technical analysis? Yes.
358 2018-03-25 04:23:57 Most of my family from my dad side comes from alaska. The reason why they charge so much is not just bc of the living conditions, but bc evil corporations know they can charge  more for basic commodities and get away with it. Esp to native American communities.
359 2018-03-25 04:21:03 Those are survival commodities in post-apocalypse settings...
360 2018-03-25 04:06:02 He didn't brag about sexually assaulting women and dating his daughter, and he didn't spew lies non-stop.  Trump's latest move (tariffs) is going to have terrible unintended consequences for domestic steel and certain US farm commodities.  The Dow has already dropped by over 10%.
361 2018-03-25 03:57:19 You haven’t heard? The welfare reform will mandate half of SNAP benefits in the form of American produced commodities
362 2018-03-25 03:55:51 Probably you feel your pinch now. It's not new for us. We avoid coffee at airport. It's your making of seeds and dhalls as tradeable commodities. Am I right? Who is the beneficiary?
363 2018-03-25 03:55:27 He does have a point. Like paper revolutionized money, commodities and trade, etc. ... transactions, currencies and ownership are digital. A consortium of traders behind computers focusing on food security, own farms around the world and control trade price. Seems odd but true.
364 2018-03-25 03:54:03 WW 2 was a real war.  The country and free world were in serious peril.  Today all the bullets and bombs provided to the military are just commodities, like selling office furniture to the government.  It isn't considered unpatriotic to make a good buck because there is no peril

368 2018-03-25 02:59:29 So even agri product and other essential commodities will be under higher GST and luxury items under lower rate, if congress comes to power.
369 2018-03-25 02:56:39 Till now he had everything free and don't know the price of commodities, food items & drinks
370 2018-03-25 02:49:23 Good Joke, r u serious ?? U should have taken ur job as finance minister seriously to fix prices of such commodities like it is on Railway Station for sake of common man....
371 2018-03-25 02:38:51 The difference is that grains and other commodities have value independent of price. Bitcoin’s value is its purported store of value. An Attack on its value is attacking its purpose

373 2018-03-25 02:21:02 @sirjee, very very good news ... bUt d question is will it be how much ;  30percent ?? Also, RGji shd clarify why there was excise duty, service tax & VAT on all d commodities, when they were in power for such a long time ???
374 2018-03-25 02:15:42 That's fine. We can use Commodities. I will bet 3 bushels of spinach on 45 days.

378 2018-03-25 01:21:13 You have to wear a shirt under the sweater because sweaters are precious commodities that need to be protected from your own filth. I am not joking even a little.
379 2018-03-25 01:20:02 WOW!
Commodities are the season great deal.
380 2018-03-25 01:12:11 I'm sorry they are going to pay the price for TeeRump's confrontational uninformed escalation of trade wars with trading partners. TeeRump wouldn't know farm commodities from a three wood. This Manchurian Candidate is ticking off American industries he can destroy, one at a time.
381 2018-03-25 01:11:23 @FA_Commodities thank you for the follow
382 2018-03-25 00:50:58 Yea but the people didn’t really have much of say in prohibition of drugs it was kind of done more for revenue collection oppression of poor and minority and many people were given false information regarding said commodities. To make them illegal
383 2018-03-25 00:49:49 No, sweetie! That would make it a good analogy. But it’s not. What I’ve described is nothing like prohibition in terms of basic policy, and of course, guns aren’t easily manufactured consumable commodities, so the black market value in civilized society would be weak.
384 2018-03-25 00:46:20 My Dad didn't gamble except for commodities. And consulting. He would do all or nothing fees. Work for a year or so with promised results and all the pay as a balloon fee at the end. Which is why he needed office intel to be sure he got paid. Once I tested small motors for days.
385 2018-03-25 00:17:40 Empower yourself by being stronger than the capitalist urge to consume addictive commodities.
386 2018-03-25 00:14:07 spiritual people on social media who hawk their etsy shops make me kind of uneasy like i get u gotta pay rent but spirituality reduced to a set of commodities makes me v uncomfortable
387 2018-03-25 00:10:37 memo to all globalists.....USA does NOT need the world markets.....the world DOES NEED USA technology, capital, agricultural commodities, oil, gas, public universities, etc..

394 2018-03-23 22:42:02 In the private property fetish, there is non-recursive valuation. That is, the system puts values on produced commodities, but cannot value the whole system which makes producing commodities possible. Hence the natural world has a very distorted valuation.

397 2018-03-23 22:26:18 Ahh well then, we actually agree...again. The animals, nonhuman & most, human do not set out to create another life...
But the fertilised ova for flu shots are deliberately begun as commodities.
BTW, I just looked it up, the flu shot eggs are now just a few cells or even, 1 cell.
398 2018-03-23 22:13:10 Some particular drugs , mostly the most common drugs . Same way there is a ban on importation of some commodities is same way there is on some drugs .
399 2018-03-23 21:54:44 Big issue with teachers dealing with it is pens become commodities. Steal one from a nice teacher to stop a strict teacher giving you a sanction.
School my bro went to had enough stationary for everyone in every classroom. So no reason to worry or steal.
400 2018-03-23 21:53:21 I would argue that capitalism is defined by certain relations between people and capital/property. I think these relations are unequal and aren't necessary for the production and exchange of commodities. I think that the idea of equalising political power was (1)
401 2018-03-23 21:52:21 No, again a fertilised ova is not sentient or autonomous.
Same with the chicks, however...the veganism with the chicks, also includes creating their life not to give them a sentient, autonomous life but to create them, knowingly to use them as commodities, things.

#Veganism is against testing on animals because it disrespects the nonhuman animal's autonomy & sentience. It overlooks that, & again uses animals for testing, as commodities not sentient.
423 2018-03-23 21:10:14 Its  been a great year to be a commodities trader of hard assets so far!!!! If you are trading a diversified portfolio of strategies it has been great trading ops. It’s very important to not just trade the stock index’s no matter your strategy. Diversification is the key.
424 2018-03-23 21:05:02 3188: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
425 2018-03-23 21:03:31 Aren't you just describing Capitalism?  I would argue that everyone has the the power and ability to make their own way in the current system. Ok its not perfect or easy but the opportunity is there for all. Homemakers, carers do produce commodities in a way & are rewarded IMO.
426 2018-03-23 21:00:38 End your addiction to drugs by refusing to be a puppet, a social plant, a weed suckling on commodities that destroy your consciousness.

429 2018-03-23 20:54:01 Its a great year to be a commodities trader. Even if people don’t like the volatility it’s about strategies.
430 2018-03-23 20:53:38 Everyone can have a small slice of economic power and earn according to how much they work. We should also extend the definition of work to activities that don't produce commodities, such as homemaking, care, and intellectualism/creativity.
431 2018-03-23 20:37:34 Not sure how you ride out nuclear fallout and a decade of nuclear winter. And in such a situation the most valuable commodities will be food and water.
432 2018-03-23 20:31:44 Hell yeah it’s stupid. You got hella art and talent but these lame asses use the stupid cultivated identity around commodities to jack up the prices for the bougie white bitches. Fuck capitalism.
433 2018-03-23 20:27:19 Mine was when I realized we were going back to a barter system, a far worse barter system than we had thousands of years ago. 

Instead of exchanging commodities, goods and services directly; instead, we are now supposed to exchange abstract token instruments. Ludicrous.
434 2018-03-23 20:18:50 I buy international commodities! I'm a fucking saint!
435 2018-03-23 20:15:22 I think predictions of ~$10 for this year seem reasonable. However I think it's predicated on SEC and CFTC coming to agreement on which "assets" are securities, and which ones are commodities, or new category "utility tokens" like in Wyoming. If regulation stalls, maybe 2019.

439 2018-03-23 19:53:23 Probably more to do with the commodities traders than the farmers. The sun rises on the farm without the need of a clock, every day. O Sunrise Hundred, Rooster Local Time. #SciFiChat
440 2018-03-23 19:53:09 “Frankie” was written by Denise Rich, then wife of billionaire commodities trader Marc Rich (!). In 1983, the couple fled to Switzerland to avoid Mark Rich being prosecuted on charges including tax evasion and violating sanctions by trading oil with Iran. #TOTP
441 2018-03-23 19:51:33 Puede que tengas razón, pero a mi lo primero que genera la suba de tasas es expectativa de ver al dólar subir frente a muchas de las divisas + fuertes del mundo, lo cual no juega a favor de los commodities, veremos..

445 2018-03-23 19:28:56 That said, even if the market doesn’t tank, the current environment of protectionist trade policies, hyper monetary/fiscal inflation, drowning sovereign debt, parabolic mkt valuations and a handcuffed fed is equally bullish recipe all things commodities.

461 2018-03-23 18:10:48 In an era where prospects are worth more than cash, you'd think it'd make financial sense to someone to properly house and feed the athletes they're hoping to develop into seven- and eight-figure commodities. This just seems like an incredibly good investment.

Most products sold in #Fezzan have a premium on them because of their scarcity & the difficulty "transporting them" (e.g cooking gas, fuel) + predatory pricing strategy. To my knowledge that's irrespective of #migration, isn't it?

478 2018-03-23 17:02:20 Being a writer of any kind is hard. You've got to be prepared for the fact that, in a capitalist system, writing is not high on the list of commodities people are looking to buy.
So, get a helmet: it's going to get rough! You've got to LOVE it, or it'll kill you.
479 2018-03-23 17:00:49 Of course China will retaliate with tariffs on US imports and commodities. I’m worried about them putting tariffs on soybeans.
480 2018-03-23 16:59:17 Just chillin now boss... Bout to head out to the golf course... Some #Commodities are close like Natgas and oil ... And metals are just warming themselves up to the chopping block

483 2018-03-23 16:47:40 I’m on the other end of it, holding a bunch of calls in USO, and common in other energy names...OPEC is about to over tighten the market, and a mad dash to commodities, especially energy with geopolitic risks at work as well. China slowing is a bit of a concern though.
484 2018-03-23 16:45:47 @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan stop the trade war. If tariffs from China are set on commodities like soybeans my family’s small Nebraska farming operation will go completely under because of the effect it will have on prices. Come visit the Midwest where the farms are in jeopardy
485 2018-03-23 16:45:17 The world banking financial systems and countries geared towards debt re mortgages and stocks / commodities/bonds etc. IF Obama had done what the rock star economy’s did.USA would have recovered within 2 years and not lost half the jobs they did.
486 2018-03-23 16:43:52 ... I presume DT is in on that action too w his Mercer buddies

I assume he is carefully manipulating his stock/commodities trading, even though he appears clownish

XOM stock is way down - time to buy low, sell high

He might also be 'investing' in the defense contractors
487 2018-03-23 16:41:28 It is more of a rotation though. Tech rally might be over, rotation to commodities underway imo.

I don't think this thought will ever see daylight of implementation as they fuel hugely to all political parties and are from big business houses.
492 2018-03-23 16:16:59 What about non-debt assets perhaps stocks with high pricing power or commodities or debt with floating rate intest payments? During an inflationary period, the asset owners still gains more.. assuming all your assets aren’t in fixed interest paying debt of course as you point out

518 2018-03-23 14:33:27 Yes so true.. people think tax decrease will have more take home pay but no it isn't.. our daily commodities their price has increased so yeah not helping..
519 2018-03-23 14:32:38 Counting 5% inflation, $10 in 2003 is $20 in 2018, so yes same price as in 2003. Question is, will it become cheaper than it historically has ever been? This is certainly possible as it happens for most commodities in every new cycle.

522 2018-03-23 14:29:39 I agree.  I think it’s a mistake when it comes to macro fundamentals (depicted in charts) to predict timing. But it’s useful to understand what’s happening long term.  When we look at wage trends and commodities, secular change is here.

548 2018-03-23 12:59:30 It's a different thing. Central banks hold currencies, bonds and other assets and commodities, all of their prices going up and down over time. So it's a balancing act. If you have too much of one sort, then you're at greater risk if there's a sudden drop in value.
549 2018-03-23 12:57:57 Trump has & should have authority to apply different tariffs on certain commodities - depending on country of origin

556 2018-03-23 12:14:45 Those below-market-price agreements for commodities are how China is able to flood markets with cheaper-made products & cheaper-priced commodities to crush their competitors & then buy their competitors’ companies.  #ChinaTariffs #tariffs #CIFIUS
557 2018-03-23 12:12:53 I'm getting the uneasy feeling that Trump owns stock in the companies that will make beaucoup bucks related to the artificial inflation of certain commodities covered in these new tariffs.  Rule 1: Trump does for himself above all.
558 2018-03-23 12:10:57 P.S. @realDonaldTrump s/ sign Executive Order making it illegal for foreign co in USA to export US commodities at below-market prices, b/c China loans or buys into struggling companies in USA if those companies agree to cheap prices for 20-35 years. #ChinaTariffs #tariffs

579 2018-03-23 10:50:16 We have a president who does not understand that markets are global. His view of everything seems to end in the 80s, when paper tickets were still used. Markets were due for a reset this year, anyway, but he is accelerating everything by destabilizing commodities. Starts there

581 2018-03-23 10:32:37 Autocrats of China (Ab)used the inherent ADVANTAGES of their Absolute/Iron-Handed Control over Chinese Society to Manipulate/Discount Prices of Energy, Commodities, Raw-Materials, Wages & Currency etcetera on MASS-SCALE & on WAR-FOOTING... to turn Entire China into World's
582 2018-03-23 10:23:55 Markets elsewhere continue to react badly to the threat of a trade war. Key industrial commodities have been hit as well, with the iron ore futures price down 5% and copper at a three-month low #Commodities #Finance #Trump #economy #China #USA

585 2018-03-23 10:10:22 Stop bashing people for the price tag of their commodities.. That is how they want it, if you dont want to patronise or give a retweet just move to the other side its not by force.

599 2018-03-23 08:40:44 With the bearish movement of markets all over the world. Its high time that commodities such as gold and oil get the limelight. This is the best time to buy both pxp and apx.

601 2018-03-23 08:35:43 "What money circulates is not commodities but their titles of ownership" (Marx, 1973, 194) Demystified, the accumulation of money means increased power to claim ownership of workers' time. #POLS320

607 2018-03-23 07:56:43 You can solve the issue of commodity based markets by realising that the commodities we sell are used for things we need and consume. Stop selling to China and manufacture at home. But that needs political maturity to vote properly. Good luck to us all.

617 2018-03-23 06:59:38 Inflation usually hurts bonds by helping to increase interest rates, which reduces the value of bonds & traps bondholders into relatively low yields compared to yields of freshly issued bonds. Stocks, real estate, commodities & currencies do a pretty good job outpacing inflation.
