3 2018-03-25 23:56:02 I would love to see a ban on A.R. 15‘s, a ban on bump stocks, and high-capacity magazines. That would be a great starting place, give it a few years and see how it works out, and then we can, as a country go from there.
4 2018-03-25 23:54:02 @realDonaldTrump is the #holy man we all need in office right now. Also, bump stocks have rights too.
5 2018-03-25 23:53:41 Banning anything is an infringement on rights. I’m not saying I agree with bump stocks, I’m saying your question answers itself.  Think about it.
6 2018-03-25 23:52:43 No, we do NOT want to repeal the Second Amendment or keep whittling away at it until we've taken away your guns! But we DO want to enact REASONABLE gun control to stop these mass shootings! That would include Universal Background Checks, bans on Bump Stocks & Large Capacity Mags

8 2018-03-25 23:50:04 They did not need to specify because that was the threat they were facing DURING that time. They did not also specify AUTO FIRE, BUMP STOCKS etc... maybe because they were not available during that time.

36 2018-03-25 23:46:47 Please tell me why you think bump stocks are required or why semi automatic weapons are necessary? Or if you disagree with better background checks. I agree we need armed guards at schools, not armed teachers. We may agree more than you think
37 2018-03-25 23:46:37 True, but an AR 15 can kill many people in several minutes.  Why can’t we ban that and bump stocks.   Aren’t you afraid for you or your family to go to school or a movie, or a concert.  Should we just say oh well there is nothing that can be done?
38 2018-03-25 23:46:23 Just two things wrong here. First, it was s the laws passed by Congress that allowed bump stocks. Second, since the LAW says that bump stocks are legal, you @realDonaldTrump  can surely expect legal challenges to your executive order.
39 2018-03-25 23:44:53 Why not?  The AR-15 works exactly like a handgun only with less deaths attributed.  If you mean bump stocks, I can agree to banning those.  More accurate without them anyways.
40 2018-03-25 23:43:16 Seems like a lot of stocks have a similar setup
41 2018-03-25 23:42:12 no worries Stocks thought you'd like it !
42 2018-03-25 23:42:05 Hating on stocks I have found doesn't pay very well no $$ in hate and anytime you put negativity into the world it will flow back on you at some point, better to spend energy focusing on stocks you like and forgetting ones you don't.
43 2018-03-25 23:41:49 Raising minimum age to 21? Mental Illness checks? Actually enforcing background checks (the NRA stopped that one from happening)? Banning bump stocks? Not making it easier to get a silencer?
44 2018-03-25 23:40:54 Funny thing is it's called the Bill of Rights not the Bill of Needs.  I will admit I do agree on bump stocks and with the automatic weapons ban of 1935 and in the 80s
45 2018-03-25 23:40:05 Ban semi automatic rifles and the bump stocks that fully automate them. That's the ban we are talking about and it is fully reasonable and responsible. You also have to know that even small common sense compromises by the gun lobby along the way would have prevented mass protests
46 2018-03-25 23:39:59 The march a start. President banning bump stocks a start. Increased background checks a start. Raising age to 21 since some 18 or 19 still in high school a start. Teachers with guns a stupid idea. Journey of 1000 miles begins with single step.  This is just the start for the Kids

48 2018-03-25 23:39:06 Looking for a pharmacy that stocks regular customer monthly pharmaceuticals. #Walgreens not doing it! Refills never in stock. What's the purpose being on every corner!! #CVS just as bad.
49 2018-03-25 23:38:24 Repeal the huges ammendment and gimmicks like bump stocks go away... AND the new MGs will be registered. Don't like bump stocks eleminate the market.
50 2018-03-25 23:38:20 Stock is down because of PRESIDENT TRUMP signing the Bill. As soon as they start on the WALL stocks will go up. Tariffs are good for USA.
51 2018-03-25 23:37:24 Again you won't get an argument about bump stocks from me. I think they are dumb. I practice distance shooting so they mean nothing to me.
52 2018-03-25 23:36:21 No, we can't, because what you stated was a half truth. Congress established the law by which bump stocks are legal. The @ATFHQ could not find a way to over turn the law, and this has to enforce them as legal. There fixed it for Denny.

57 2018-03-25 23:33:37 Also just to be clear....I do support the ban on bump stocks. High cap magazines, that’s a waste of time....even with multiple 5 round mags can be changed in seconds. The AR is the exact same rifle and round as most hunting rifles. The only difference is it’s black.
58 2018-03-25 23:33:36 It's for all of us. A deranged shooter isn't asking your opinion on gun control while he lights up a crowd. I'll take bump stocks though, anything is better than the status quo.
59 2018-03-25 23:33:08 Twenty-four hours after the March for Our Lives, let me be clear. As governor, I will seek legislation to:

   • Ban bump stocks and other rapid-fire modifications.
   • Mandate safe storage of firearms.
   • Expand gun buyback programs.
 (1/4)
60 2018-03-25 23:32:45 They are, though the bump stock is what helped the Las Vegas shooter carry out the deadliest mass shooting on US soil. Now slide/bump stocks are a widely known attachment for aspiring killers. Heaven forbid the other attachments for guns don't become part of a tragic story.
61 2018-03-25 23:32:30 Incredibly--you still have a chance for redemption. Call for the outlaw of semi automatic weapons, bump stocks and the passage of other sensible gun control measures.  That is your only hope. Do it.  Or resign.
62 2018-03-25 23:32:20 There it is. Stocks go up tomorrow. Duke lost.
63 2018-03-25 23:31:49 There’s something called #CommonSenseGunLaws. You could still protect yourself. We don’t need ARs in this country we don’t need bump stocks, if Australia did it, I don’t understand why you can’t let go. It’s like watching ppl refusing to grow up. #smh #GunControl #accountability
64 2018-03-25 23:31:21 last i heard it was bump stocks they were banning denver tried to pass it but got denied
i havent got any notices and im still a proud owner today of my Ar15 and no ones taking it away(.)
65 2018-03-25 23:31:15 DOWN GOES DUKE
66 2018-03-25 23:30:28 Personally I own AR15s and could give a rat’s ass about bump stocks! Just tired of liberals making comments like a “Bump stock converts AR15s to fully semi automatics allowing you to fire 1000s of rounds per minute!” If liberals are going to legislate rights away know the facts!
67 2018-03-25 23:30:21 Bump stocks are irrelevant. It's a minor almost a non-issue. You can do the same thing in other ways.

70 2018-03-25 23:29:16 Stocks get a smoke and a sandwich after the showing?
71 2018-03-25 23:29:05 Once again some of the most vocal for #2A rights have not realized that division politics has galvanized the opposition in an immovable irrelevancy. There will be no law passed as there is no sway of opinion. Bump stocks were used as a foreseeable problem now has no law to pass
72 2018-03-25 23:29:05 No one is trying to take all your precious toys away, Joe-Bob. We want sensible regulations - universal background checks.  Maybe ban assault weapons and bump stocks. 

How can you tell who is "the good guy with a gun" w/o background checks?
73 2018-03-25 23:29:03 @davidhogg111, it appears part of the conversation needs to be about the NRA’s  scare tactics regarding the 2nd Amendment. People need to know that raising age limits, banning of AR-15s and bump stocks, and more extensive background checks, have nothing to with the 2nd.
74 2018-03-25 23:28:46 Even on my worst days, I love #trading #Stocks!  Actually, on some really bad days in the #StockMarket I hate it & wonder why I ever started, but just for that moment.

77 2018-03-25 23:27:49 Features like pistol grip, collapsible butt stocks shouldn't determine if a gun is legal or not.  Fully automatic rifles are already illegal which they should be.
78 2018-03-25 23:27:31 I think all you’ll get is bump stocks.
79 2018-03-25 23:26:35 I know i can never change your mind, and that’s fine, I’m just frustrated that we can’t even have a conversation about bump stocks, AR-15’s, raising age limit to 21. Zero.

83 2018-03-25 23:20:38 I promise you bump stocks are not as scary as the media portrays. I personally think they are a complete waste of money. Speed looks scary, but it has a negative affect on accuracy
84 2018-03-25 23:20:15 I agree bumpstocks should not be avaible but the legislation should only say bump stocks not things hay speed up rate of fire.  Background checks are done at every state.  Same background check also. Difference is waiting periods.  Cali has 10days. Other states have less. Sooo
85 2018-03-25 23:19:20 Absolutely not. It's a slippery slope. The more they pass restrictions and ban things like bump stocks, the closer we become to having no 2a.
86 2018-03-25 23:19:05 How could he be “coming for your guns” and legalize bump stocks? Something is amiss with this tweet? Please if you are not going to stop tweeting, at least fact check first.
87 2018-03-25 23:18:33 fuck The Market and fuck Stocks!

90 2018-03-25 23:16:20 I know that people who have mental illness and those who have had restraining orders for abusive behavior have been able to legally purchase guns, and have gone on to kill people.  I also know that bump stocks and semiautomatic weapons are legal for purchase as well.
91 2018-03-25 23:15:44 Futures signal further losses for Asian stocks as the week kicks off, with Japanese indexes indicating declines of about 1 percent at the start of Monday trading. #Stocks #AsianMarkets
92 2018-03-25 23:15:37 What about support for the millions of children asking for you to protect them! What kind of coward stops Bill’s that would protect the citizens of our country and our students from Ak-15 and bump stocks! Oh, that would be you and @SenateMajLdr who are owned by ur donors!
93 2018-03-25 23:15:33 I agree. My point being that it would at least reduce the number of mass shootings. But we are denied even that. Bump stocks are still legal. Legislation that added mental health to BG checks was removed. There is no forward movement. Only backward.
94 2018-03-25 23:14:09 If a majority of citizens agree we can reasonably limit the scope of what weapons citizens should have access to, it will happen. Not sure what the argument is for ppl needing RPGs and not sure what it is for AR-15s and bump stocks?
95 2018-03-25 23:13:36 Military also don't use bump stocks they r highly inaccurate from what I've researched.  Do you know why bump stocks were actually first created?
96 2018-03-25 23:13:01 What  "common sense exceptions" to background checks for "all purchases" would you allow & why? Why ban bump stocks & not assault type weapons that are designed only for the purpose of killing people with ease & speed? What about high capacity mags? All things no civilian needs.
97 2018-03-25 23:12:53 @QuentinWillson can the classic car market continue on its atmospheric trajectory? Historically there’s been adjustments. It seems like the perfect storm and most modern classics are the new bullet proof stocks. Your thoughts?
98 2018-03-25 23:12:37 Think of simple gun laws. No 50-round magazines. No bump stocks. No rifles designed to look like military assault weapons.    Must be 21 or in military to purchase. Notice that **none** of these ban guns.

103 2018-03-25 23:08:23 YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF WHY THEY NEED TO BAN BUMP STOCKS AND MILITARY STYLE WEAPONS!!!!
104 2018-03-25 23:07:50 So, if bump stocks and certain rifles are banned; will we then focus on the WHY people are doing it? Will we then look at recidivist criminal activity in poverty stricken areas? Gang Crime? #MentalHealthMatters
105 2018-03-25 23:07:14 For the record: I'm absolutely FOR better background checks (so that people who shouldn't have guns can't legally have one).  I also support banning bump stocks.
106 2018-03-25 23:06:54 $NBDR $OMVS $CDIX $DSGT $FRFS all have either PR #news due, Q's, going current, stop signs going away, #mergers updated..this is going to be an exciting next few weeks for anyone holding any of these #stocks. #Pennystocks for now some will eventually be uplisted to #NASDAQ #rt 
107 2018-03-25 23:06:46 Nobody wants to take away guns. That's bullshit NRA propaganda. The general population does not need assault weapons, or banana clips or bump stocks.
108 2018-03-25 23:06:41 I hope I’m wrong and this stock goes to $100 here. But too many people coming into stocks like this looking to make a fortune short-term, these people end up losing a most of  the money. I think you could agree there is an increase risk in investing in microcaps right?
109 2018-03-25 23:06:20 If the Vegas shooter had a 50 cal he prob could have killed more on semi auto than .556, .223 or 7.62 using bump stocks.
110 2018-03-25 23:05:52 Tbh I'm prob getting a bump stock since it'll be illegal soon, but each attachment has pros and cons. Bump stocks would obv reduce accuracy
111 2018-03-25 23:04:39 Walmart....stocks guns? I go to Tesco for food, maybe home furnishings, but guns wtf is wrong with America?
112 2018-03-25 23:04:36 Plh Investments I am encouraging you to invest in yourself it can be education it can be stocks and bonds and more
113 2018-03-25 23:03:34 1-Ban semi-auto guns that fire high-velocity rounds
2-Ban bump stocks and other accessories that simulate auto weapons
3-Create a database for gun sales & universal background checks
4-Raise the legal age to guns to 21
5-Close gun show loophole and loophole for 2nd-hand gun sales
114 2018-03-25 23:02:50 Do u have any stocks or just crypto
115 2018-03-25 23:00:46 What are you talking about? We already got your president saying he's going to ban bump stocks. The dialogues already changed since you were sitting here.
116 2018-03-25 23:00:07 Since the founders failed to address AR-15s and bump stocks in the constitution, we need a solution that balances these rights with the lives of your child and mine. NRA can still make a buck. I applaud these kids that are participating!
117 2018-03-25 22:59:42 I think I’ve made it clear semi-automatic weapons should definitely be regulated, in my opinion. And background checks are not always required at gun shows, that should change.
I’m glad bump stocks have finally been proposed to be banned.
118 2018-03-25 22:58:56 @native21cards Hi. Do you still make those T.Hanks cards, which have the picture of him doing the finger guns? If you don’t sell them Direct, can you tell me who stocks them in the U.K.? Thanks
119 2018-03-25 22:58:27 Common sense lol. You don't even know the current laws obviously if you use that term. 

You don't even know my opinions as well.

Ban guns from those who make killing threats.
Ban bump stocks or any device that creates a full auto system.

But go on. Be ignorant.
120 2018-03-25 22:57:31 Luckily for the rest of us, the majority of Americans want stricter gun laws and that is exactly what we are going to get.  The NRA won’t even negotiate on bump stocks...BUMP STOCKS. They had their chance to lead, they’ve failed, miserably.  We will take over from here!
121 2018-03-25 22:56:32 Again, it is not having guns vs. taking away all guns. It is 1) background checks, 2) preventing the mentally ill from getting weapons, and 3) banning bump stocks. What part of "WELL-REGULATED militia" do you not understand. The constitution doesn't say "unlimited for all".
122 2018-03-25 22:55:35 Meh. I'd never heard of bump stocks before LV so I don't care much except it seems like more encroachment
123 2018-03-25 22:55:21 I would guess if you asked the two council members who started this idea how many of the shooters in the last several years had bump stocks, they wouldn’t have a clue. This won’t help. Its all about publicity.
124 2018-03-25 22:54:54 @DLoesch Again - really trying to understand this. You say you are a woman of faith, but do you think Jesus would support the proliferation of automatic weapons? bump stocks?
125 2018-03-25 22:54:36 Still not quite auto (close) but I do agree with getting rid of bump stocks.
126 2018-03-25 22:54:34 With $68Billion in their pockets, you are going to have to wrest the government & concessions from their cold, dead hands.
Look at what happened in Tassie. Just think of the money the SMSFs, Miners, Banks, IPA, BCA will throw at the next election.
Buy stocks in Advertisers & TV.
127 2018-03-25 22:53:47 "Six months ago, everything was good and you couldn't find a reasom to sell stocks. Now you can't find a reason to hold them." Larry Peruzzi of Mischler Financial #stockmarket
128 2018-03-25 22:53:03 Per usual stop with the drama.   Stick to what most gun enthusiasts want, the banning of one gun. One fucking gun. Large clips and bump stocks. Could you live you're life without one gun?
129 2018-03-25 22:51:59 ban bump stocks ban assault rifles those guns are meant for war not hunting or mowing down innocent ppl.
130 2018-03-25 22:51:19 Apparently they can't understand the difference between taking away all guns and licensing & registering them, & removing military assault style weapons and bump stocks & being 21 years of age to purchase.  Why would any law abiding citizen be against those regulations?
131 2018-03-25 22:51:02 @MarshBrentnall where do you see junior mining stocks on TSX Venture going in 2018?
132 2018-03-25 22:50:48 Modified? Are you talking about bump stocks? Because so far, that's been a factor in exactly 1 crime, and even as terrible as it was, I'm not sure it was even as big a factor as it's being made out to be.
133 2018-03-25 22:50:16 Yes, noted in the link that AACR stocks will be covered Easter weekend, of which $ONCS will likely be one to feature.
134 2018-03-25 22:48:35 Assault weapons are already banned. There are already universal background checks. High capacity magazines were banned. Bump stocks are and should’ve always been banned.
135 2018-03-25 22:47:53 owning stocks basically means you own the company so they can ofc veto an exchange like this, and since its sm c&c, meaning they have control over variety and such, i find it surprising 
136 2018-03-25 22:47:52 IMO stocks are not a weapon first of all it is an accessory and it is not a favorite one at that .
137 2018-03-25 22:46:38 That being said though, Bump stocks should be equally as regulated.
138 2018-03-25 22:46:01 You are seriously misinformed about the capabilities of the AR-15 platform.....
Bump stocks I can see getting either banned or seriously registered and regulated.
But three round bursts? No.....
139 2018-03-25 22:45:59 They were a limited release, don't think any where stocks them any more.
140 2018-03-25 22:44:22 OOOH ok if you put it that way ye
but iirc sm only owns the stocks while woollim takes care of the business part? if its like that can they prevent this to happen?
141 2018-03-25 22:43:20 “Hard to say?” Bump stocks are inherently impossible to aim. And semi-auto barrels are thin & lack any sort of heat dissipation mechanism. Comparing bump stocks to purpose-built machine guns is ludicrous.
142 2018-03-25 22:41:54 Respectfully disagree. #StormyDanielsDay is about exposing Trump for what he is. Someone who bullies, intimidates, stocks & payoff his victims. Not very presidential at all.
143 2018-03-25 22:41:30 That will help stocks tomorrow. Not!
144 2018-03-25 22:40:48 How about acknowledging action taken in bump stocks. Refusing to mention things like this is why you aren’t taken seriously. Your motives are clearly partisan and not about stopping violence in schools
145 2018-03-25 22:40:36 Obama legalized bump stocks. He didnt do anything on gun control when Sandy Hook. So quit busting Trumps ass cause he hasnt done anything. Yea hes had some crazy tweets. But he's done more than Obama has done 1 and half years than obama done in 4.
146 2018-03-25 22:40:32 Stocks.excahnge just gave withdrawal error although the XSH addess is correct
147 2018-03-25 22:40:13 No app da apple mesmo que vem com o iPhone, stocks, mas da pra procurar no Google também o valor do ouro no dia
148 2018-03-25 22:39:55 I'm not a gun phobic. I own many of them. I'm a pretty damn good shot so I don't need bump stocks or large capacity magazines to hit a target either. I also know that gun control does not mean gun confiscation, because this isn't and either or subject.
149 2018-03-25 22:39:09 #Catapult cap raising should not come as a surprise, burn rate was not sustainable. Check out the mid October filings, always great to see #founders cash out at higher rates than the rest of us. #ASX $CAT #trading #smallcap #Runway #notanotherleaguewidedeal #stocks #markets
150 2018-03-25 22:39:08 only bump stocks
151 2018-03-25 22:38:53 That also wanted a ban on bump stocks that was only used once in a mass shooting ever! Again what common sense law do u want?
152 2018-03-25 22:37:26 Tokens that represent shares! Being able to trade stocks like you can trade pokemon cards <3
153 2018-03-25 22:37:11 In Boston we had “Bump uglies, not stocks” 
154 2018-03-25 22:37:09 BS. The @NRA has supported a number of gun laws over the years and initiated the idea of banning bump stocks. They want background checks tuned up.
Keep this in mind: their are gun orgs who do NOT compromise. If the NRA fell, they'd take over.
155 2018-03-25 22:36:55 Justice Department is already working on banning bump stocks
156 2018-03-25 22:36:32 Someone's getting excited: "12 month forward PE of the ASX100 is now the cheapest it has been since February 2016, and earnings estimates are heading up, not down as they were back then" (Shaw and Partners) #ausbiz #XJO #investing #XJO #stocks
157 2018-03-25 22:36:20 I agree the absolute angle of your argument; but relatively speaking, valuation metrics provide information about the price of exposure. At that pt it’s a game of identifying the bad stocks to hold to get away from tail risk, something index funds do not avoid.
158 2018-03-25 22:36:10 Yeah i know that, i have stocks lots of stocks, fuck stocks im going for real estate; a condo on sb is only like 400K, the rest I invest. And then i shit on all my haters
159 2018-03-25 22:35:36 I can confirm this to be true. I downloaded my data file and was shocked. There is absolutely NO REASON they need the level of information they have accumulated. With one click, I could go back 3yrs and tell you where I was at, who I spoke/texted with, etc.
160 2018-03-25 22:35:34 Is Trump less hated by the Deep State since his focus on DACA and banning bump stocks? 
161 2018-03-25 22:35:30 Your going to have to take advantage of the futures market.
I would suggest, that is high risk,  you simply cannot walk
away for even 5 min.  A more expensive choice is to
simply Buy the crude oil via a futures contract.  Again
that requires more risk.  Stocks, or a stock  XON.
162 2018-03-25 22:34:33 I don't see how anyone could argue otherwise besides regular volume being used bc of Psyche. Especially in OTC and lower PPS stocks.
163 2018-03-25 22:34:11 Nothing new with GOP working exclusively for the rich. Well GOP have you looked at how Trump has lost money for your stocks last week?
164 2018-03-25 22:34:09 I agree, that’s why they’re moving towards legislation on banning bump stocks. Remind me who authorized the sale of bump stocks and under what administration please.
165 2018-03-25 22:33:47 Check your stock holdings. More #DesperateDems own defense stocks than Trump.
166 2018-03-25 22:32:43 The #60Minutes #StormyDaniels interview is 2018's village stocks for the petty criminal whose public humiliation will be total and deserved.
167 2018-03-25 22:32:36 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
168 2018-03-25 22:32:15 I completely agree with David but know from experience full auto is useless.  I'm willing to concede the bump stocks for that reason but I agree with David that the founders wrote the 2A to limit government not the citizens.
169 2018-03-25 22:31:53 Also should have made it 4 stocks to one in favor of Falcon on the first one, and 4 stocks to one for Fox in the second one
170 2018-03-25 22:31:48 Go to Somalia. 

No taxes and your gun toting paradise. 

You can even have real automatic weapons there. No need for sloppy work-a-rounds like bump stocks.
171 2018-03-25 22:30:42 Looking forward to 2018
172 2018-03-25 22:30:30 I don’t love it all. Some combinations suck. Those little sticks with orange (gell-ish stuff) in them, I can kill a box quick.

That’s funny my sister loves mink chocolate stuff and always stocks up on ghirarelli peppermint bars, which are decent if you’re desperate. 
173 2018-03-25 22:28:43 Its all good tho, my great grandmother died (her "mother") a few years after and she inherited everything (money, stocks and property). She and her second husband spent through it. My grandma didn't have a knack for choosing good men. The second husband was a doosy tho.
174 2018-03-25 22:28:11 In order: Bump stocks, AR’s, all semi autos (including handguns), registration, grandfathered existing must be be destroyed at time of death (no estate transfers), door to door confiscation. Of course they don’t want #2A repealed. Deny it all you want. #DefendTheSecond
175 2018-03-25 22:27:56 We were already mouthy. You and the cowboys for that matter are the laughing stocks of the nfc east and have been for two decades. I know it hurts. I dealt with it. But now we won, when it matters, ya know we are alive now not in the stoneage, so yea your gonna hear about it.
176 2018-03-25 22:27:22 Almost every single firearm made is semi automatic. I completely support banning bump stocks since they turn a legal semi automatic gun into a fully automatic illegal weapon. However, suggesting that we should ban every semi automatic weapon is both unwise and reckless.
177 2018-03-25 22:25:53 The point of a silencer at close range is to protect the shooters hearing. At long range it will not give away a snipers position. But it's still louder than you would want indoors. Adding, bump stocks, laser sights, bayonets to a gun is like putting a new case on your phone. (4)
178 2018-03-25 22:24:40 What did Obama do ? He made bump stocks legal and stood around pointing fingers but did NOTHING.  So don’t try and blame Trump - that can has been kicked down the road for far to long and finally have a president not afraid to take a stand.
179 2018-03-25 22:24:12 Have you ever actually used a bump stock or an automatic weapon? You sound grossly misinformed. The downfall of bump stocks is that it needs to be shoulder fired because the butt needs support.
180 2018-03-25 22:22:49 For those working in bigger corporations, have you taken advantage of your company’s stocks and shares scheme yet?
181 2018-03-25 22:20:58 6 breakouts: $CDNA, $QHC. One sub-$1. All around lack of interest in either mainstream or penny stocks.
182 2018-03-25 22:20:08 In short:

Bump stocks were OK.

Bumpy spreads weren't.
183 2018-03-25 22:20:02 Yes I remember. You have me on this.  Yes I’m in the commonly forgot part.  I meant semi automatic with bump stocks etc.  but not really my whole argument. Take the win.  I’m out.  Not interested in engaging.  You don’t seem to be about  the discussion.  And I’m not about the win
184 2018-03-25 22:19:57 I agree with you but I am not mentally into being invested all the time. I take my time reading market books from the greats and TA. Then keep an eye on what stocks are setting up.

Didn't Jesse Livermore say you cannot trade in every market...its too tough psychologically
185 2018-03-25 22:19:50 It's not that easy to identify this type of player, but volatile stocks that can define themselves quickly are very valuable. If someone isn't going to click, you want to know as soon as possible. Again, sometimes just not knowable or factorable.
186 2018-03-25 22:19:50 And a lot of people have already seen all of her the can handle
187 2018-03-25 22:19:37 Buy Amazon stocks Instead :p
188 2018-03-25 22:19:10 So do you thank President Trump for Banning Bump Stocks and expanding background checks before gun purchasing??
189 2018-03-25 22:18:43 But with a bump stock it shoots like an automatic weapon, son. Bump stocks shouldn’t be available
190 2018-03-25 22:18:43 You will never ever ever ever get a national ban on assault weapons. How about thanking Trump for banning bump stocks. That obama made legal.  Obama worst president in history
191 2018-03-25 22:17:43 Even the folks that say banning bump stocks is enough don’t appreciate that the 7.62 pre-NATO and the 5.56 rounds are specifically designed to kill and/or create massive trauma. All compressions will do is force that last pint of blood through the pressure bandage. Ban ARs now!
192 2018-03-25 22:17:05 Stocks unfortunately lack the “cool factor” and the traditional finance world has barely acknowledged that the 18-30 demographic exists (for obvious reasons). 

Anyway, interesting discussion!
193 2018-03-25 22:17:04 Ah yes. All those voting citizens who oppose background checks and banning bump stocks.

Sure buddy.
194 2018-03-25 22:16:46 What did obama and the democrats do for 8 years.   Trump is change ! He just started. He’s not a politician you should get behind him if you want him to make more change.  He already banned bump stocks. Where is your acknowledgment on that

196 2018-03-25 22:15:30 So if the NRA isn't willing to give give up bump stocks, ARs or the gun show loop hole....exactly what ground are they willing to cover to find the common ground?
Right. Nothing. Cuz they have no common ground or common sense when it comes to gun sales.
197 2018-03-25 22:14:14 10x6 = 60. Fact. The difference in accuracy/control = almost entirely moot in close quarters such as a night club or classroom. Fact. Bump stocks are for idiots (opinion), should be banned (opinion) & negate the accuracy/control you're citing as an advantage. Fact.
198 2018-03-25 22:14:07 Bump stocks or any devise that turns a legal weapon into a illegal weapon is banned
199 2018-03-25 22:13:43 They are also similar by the fact they both have triggers magazines and stocks it’s like saying a mustang is the same as a civic because they both have four wheels and a gas pedal 
200 2018-03-25 22:13:09 how about we ban weapons that should only be necessary in war?  how about we ban high capacity magazines?   how about we ban bump stocks?  I still haven't found 1 person who can reasonable explain why any of this is a bad idea #GunControlNow
201 2018-03-25 22:13:03 Happier with bricks and mortar than stocks but risk wherever you go.  But it's called living!
202 2018-03-25 22:12:57 I don't think they LEGALIZED but stocks,  it was just created during his presidency.
203 2018-03-25 22:11:25 It isn’t news that investors everywhere are still cool to investing in oil stocks/companies. As oil prices sustain up here and possibly higher for a while, sentiment will shift. That’s what KSA is waiting for, and why they’re throttling to get rid of the glut.
204 2018-03-25 22:10:50 And I never mentioned automatics or bump stocks
205 2018-03-25 22:10:14 A few months back I was shocked if we didn't gap up slightly and rip into the close. Now I'm surprised if stocks down open up -0.5%.
206 2018-03-25 22:08:01 Omg a billionaire has sex with people, do you see how sad you’ve become
207 2018-03-25 22:07:23 I judge from the synopsis, too, but yes, and same. 

The first three sentences to first paragraph really determine for me whether I'm going to be hate-reading something, or loving it. When low on stocks, I bite the bullet, and suffer through.
208 2018-03-25 22:07:18 Sure. Just wait until they discover stocks.
209 2018-03-25 22:06:04 Bottom line it was developed for the military it is a military weapon . All Assault Rifles. No wonder even Trump banned bump stocks. Theses weapons are definitely not met for human consumption & appear to be the weapon of choice for shooters.
210 2018-03-25 22:05:53 These kids are being used. The parkland shooting was a false flag event. The Las Vegas shooting wasnt enough and didnt have enough to push the gun control issue. The media talked about banning bump stocks & everyone didnt care. Where was this march when 58 ppl died that night #BS
211 2018-03-25 22:05:02 If these stocks had been bought on or about February 14th, on the margin basis suggested by us, and sold six months later, the ...
212 2018-03-25 22:04:12 I call it public created health care can’t let the government do it we the people have to create top level health care for all by all of us chipping in. No  CEOs or boards or stocks or Corp just people making it work for a more then reasonable pay check
213 2018-03-25 22:02:08 I agree.  You live in Jersey.  I live in Upstate New York.  Let's meet in Manhattan when this blows up and drink at McSorleys.  Stocks need to grow organically.  This is complete nonsense.
214 2018-03-25 22:00:41 So who is has M-4's? I have a semi automatic 9mm. That is plenty for me but I believe I should have the right to carry based on 2nd amendment. I believe that the bump stocks should be disallowed but I also believe if a person wants an AR  15 they should be allowed to have one.

216 2018-03-25 22:00:27 Perhaps not, but public policy should be guided by the real good of the nation, not a momentary passion. This temporary burst of enthusiasm needs to be guided into action to make a real change, not wasted on a pointless fake victory like banning bump stocks.
217 2018-03-25 21:58:59 Bill, the analysis of Chicago is so simple.  Academics get Phd’s writing tons of blabber that is nonsense.  I went to Hyde Park HS in the early 50’s where the modern “Gangs” were born.  We made “zip” guns in the machine shop and the stocks in the Wood shop........
218 2018-03-25 21:57:55 Thank You Senator...please continue to help us and convince 
Congress that responsible gun reform has nothing to do with abolishing the 2nd ammendme t. Banning bump stocks and high power magazines...comprehensive nationwide background checks will save lives.
219 2018-03-25 21:57:52 Same here. Who knows what'll happen anyway. My dad made a critical error with some stocks- made his retirement fund pennies
220 2018-03-25 21:57:48 Problem : gold and silver may spike but not sure their respective stocks will get a bid to follow it up. Typically in worst part of selling , everything gets sold where it relates to stocks that track commodities.  That was a risk I was not willing to gamble on over the weekend
221 2018-03-25 21:57:42 Yeh, are the stocks

225 2018-03-25 21:55:31 Way are the market so sensitive or is it the traders that scare them to sell to make better profit after dumping the price tag on stocks?
226 2018-03-25 21:55:13 Automatic firearms are illegal so it does make sense to ban bump stocks for the sake of consistency.
227 2018-03-25 21:53:58 Idiots! He met with the sane one. Kyle who really was focused on results. President has passed a bill to harden background checks,banned bump stocks!Kyle actually created app to help students with Problems.Kyle takes positive actions ! HOGG'S fowl mouthpiece!

We ask, we insist on common sense gun laws: ban assault weapons & bump stocks, Age 21 and waiting period to buy, close gun show loophole & background checks!
234 2018-03-25 21:50:13 Bumb stocks are legal, so . . .
235 2018-03-25 21:49:20 They would if they own pharmaceutical stocks. Which BTW #CorrupTrump does, in several cos.
236 2018-03-25 21:48:33 It's definitely contra Piketty since he's claiming it's mainly other types of capital, stocks, corporations, biz ownership etc, aka ala Marx Das Kapital. (Piketty had it wrong on so many fronts.)
237 2018-03-25 21:48:22 The true motives are exposed.
18 years old to 21 is not the motive. Bump stocks are not the motive. Background checks are not the motive. Elemination of guns is the mission

239 2018-03-25 21:47:28 AR-15's, and similar semi-automatic and fully automatic weapons are designed to kill, stop, or maim people quickly and "efficiently." Bump stocks on semi-auto and high capacity magazines are for killing people. They have no place in hunting or sport. Ban them.
240 2018-03-25 21:47:00 ça se comprend en même temps on est vraiment stocks mdrrr
241 2018-03-25 21:46:39 @realDonaldTrump @PressSec I bet David Hogg plays PUBG, what hypocrites to attack NRA and anyone pro gun-then they go home and play this Murder Game, ban bump stocks and PUBG! PUBG is huge with school kids and alike right now.
242 2018-03-25 21:46:05 Yeah like I said and I don’t think I’m alone. I legally own registered guns, and I am a NRA MEMBER. We are not against universal background checks and other rules. Rules are ok. But we draw the line at actual banning. bump stocks need to go to
243 2018-03-25 21:45:59 The cheapest stocks are usually in that zone by default.
244 2018-03-25 21:44:24 Looks like I was misinformed on that one. Bump stocks are legal for now, but a lot of people are working on changing that.

247 2018-03-25 21:43:31 Report - AG Sessions Sends a Request to DOJ to OUTLAW those AR15 Bump Stocks, BUT the MSM & Democrats are SILENT,  why is that ??
248 2018-03-25 21:42:57 Follows trends. Almost bottomed out with Trump election after the boon during Obama. Watch those stocks! And I mean the paper ones.
249 2018-03-25 21:42:49 You are absolutely correct. Had the sheriffs dept., the FBI or the school done anything it would have never happened. Banning bump stocks shows something is being done. The left will say it’s not enough. It will show them for who they are. They want all guns banned
250 2018-03-25 21:42:46 Do you really see the other first world countries as utopian? What do you think needs to be done to get the US moving in that direction? do you support any gun reforms like back ground checks for all sales, banning of bump stocks?
251 2018-03-25 21:42:04 The fact that your all blaming a gun and an attachment that the shooter didn't have is funny to me bump stocks don't make AR-15S FULLY AUTOMATIC IT CONVERTS IT TO BURST FIRE WHICH IS NOT FULL AUTO MY AR-15 IS FULLY AUTOMATIC AND HAS NO BUMP STOCK #ICALLBS
252 2018-03-25 21:41:28 2/ @RickSantorum fo you really believe asking kids to learn CPR and ‘not ask others’ to pass gun safety legislation is going to change anything?  No?  I thought not. An easy place to start: Universal background checks, banning high capacity cartridges and bump stocks.
253 2018-03-25 21:40:59 Yet Trump is the one taking away your bump stocks.
254 2018-03-25 21:40:09 YulTi just gave us new wallpaper stocks
255 2018-03-25 21:39:42 You're babbling now. Trump never promised anything beyond trying to eliminate bump stocks and looking at raising the age limit on certain guns. The fixation people like you have on magazines is plain silly and shows how little you know.
256 2018-03-25 21:39:41 Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure bump stocks are illegal.
257 2018-03-25 21:38:25 AR-15. Even a pistol can kill multiple people in a fast succession. Bump stocks help xP.
258 2018-03-25 21:38:12 What does any of that have to do with what is being discussed,  i.e. needing bump stocks to protect yourself from the government? I am a gun owner and I think arguments like that make us look stupid.
259 2018-03-25 21:37:44 ok there are a few things wrong there

1.i don't really care where you live, if you look at the places in America with strict gun laws, gun crimes skyrocket

2. bump stocks can be homemade

3. and most importantly, assult riffles are already banned in the US, an AR is not one
260 2018-03-25 21:36:21 bring back the stocks!
261 2018-03-25 21:35:52 Such a tired argument. Professional guards are much different than nuts being able to buy bump stocks/huge ammo clips.
262 2018-03-25 21:35:34 That highlights the issues in cherry picking figures and everyone looking at Vanadium stocks should take a long hard look. The biggest issue is the acid leach. It's not just OPEX but CAPEX sky rockets
263 2018-03-25 21:35:11 I don’t see a problem, I live in an unarmed country (apart from the Military and police) we haven’t had a school shooting in 22 years. We reformed gun regs after Dunblane school shooting. Most of the kids only want screening, bans on assault style weapons, bump stocks etc
264 2018-03-25 21:34:56 Can you even tell the truth just once? Obama did NOT legalize bump stocks. The idiots who believe your lies are NOT the majority!
265 2018-03-25 21:34:45 Better background checks & closing loopholes just got passed on Friday in the Omnibus..... #fixNICS #StopSchoolViolenceAct 

Bump stocks ban was officially proposed by AG Jeff Sessions on Friday as well. 

So next....
266 2018-03-25 21:34:20 Turns out @BigCheds and I have pretty much the same timeline of trading, from penny stocks, to options, to crypto. We even played some of the same pumps years ago. Nice to see someone else who understands the snakes on the OTC and convertible debt, designed to rob the uninformed.

271 2018-03-25 21:31:19 -rounds at their target. Obvisouly, this can be modified and change the weapons effectiveness, so really it seems that the weapon modifications, bump stocks, military grade metal parts(USGI spec) and the typical attachments should be the main focus.
272 2018-03-25 21:30:41 @RickSantorum stop the madness. Ban assault rifles bump stocks and high capacity magazines now. Don't listen to the NRA, stop taking their money. #BanAssaultWeapons #GunReformNow #NeverAgain
273 2018-03-25 21:30:11 Some suggestions include: universal background checks, keeping databases properly up to date so background checks even work, banning bump stocks (they can be used to turn a semi-auto into a full-auto and have been used in many recent mass shootings),

275 2018-03-25 21:29:25 Diversification among stocks doesn’t just mean buying many different stocks—if you don’t research the stocks you buy, you will likely end up with many stocks that are very similar.
276 2018-03-25 21:28:00 Also how can we expect law enforcement to protect us from criminals/murderers when we let them legally buy AR-15’s, bump stocks, large capacity magazines etc. and cops have a handgun? That’s does not make sense.
277 2018-03-25 21:27:45 Stocks down.  Taxpayers stuck with bill for Wall because T lied and said  would pay. No winning there.

Prohibit, collapsible stocks to 32”, and based on the founding fathers actions regarding the first semi-auto .44 caliber Girondi rifle, detachable 20 and then 30 rd magazines they GAVE to civilians. They knew about semi auto rifles and permitted people and engage
279 2018-03-25 21:25:11 The Supreme court had ruled several years back that the 2nd  Amendment doesn’t cover assault weapons / weapons of war.  These kids are asking for sensible gun reform. For instance, you need to be 21 to buy a weapon or banning sale of AR 15s (and equivalent) and bump stocks.

281 2018-03-25 21:24:47 It’s hard to hate gun violence in schools, yet support former president @BarackObama for he did legalize bump stocks in his presidency which allow semiautomatic guns to be transformed into illegal machine guns due to the recoil mechanism produced.
282 2018-03-25 21:24:41 4 min timer 3 stocks imo
283 2018-03-25 21:24:11 Some think this is good policy-
1-Ban semi-auto guns firing High-V rounds
2-Ban bump stocks and other accs. that simulate auto weapons
3-Create a DB for gun sales & univ. background class.
4-Raise the legal age to guns to 21
5-Close gun show loophole and for 2nd-hand gun sales
284 2018-03-25 21:23:45 He hasn't banned bump stocks. He is "thinking" about it. Check his tweets.

286 2018-03-25 21:22:31 And there are obviously accessories, like bump stocks and extended magazines, which are only useful for mass killing, or certain ammunition such as armor piercing rounds, which are really specifically cop killing bullets. These are not things everyday people should have.
287 2018-03-25 21:21:26 How can the world truly be getting better, if our stocks of water, soil, forests, fisheries are dangerously depleted, and if ecosystems seem to be incredibely depleted, mental health levels on the rise, and vast global inequality?
288 2018-03-25 21:20:08 But you abandoned the gun owners and the Second Amendment. I'm very disappointed in your decision on gun control and bans on bump stocks and for not stopping Fix NICS.
289 2018-03-25 21:19:38 @Visa Follow Citigroup’s example and stop doing business with any retailer that sells guns to people under 21, or that sells bump stocks or extended magazines.
290 2018-03-25 21:18:53 Lines can be drawn in magazine capacity, ease to release and reload magazines, sale of bump stocks, comprehensive background checks, registration of fire arms and ammo, required training, storage, how and where they’re sold, etc, etc... lots can be done to make guns safer. Lots.
291 2018-03-25 21:18:20 Well it seems like Trump has done more already for us then has been done in years.  What stocks I have or gaining money, tax money, deregulation.
292 2018-03-25 21:18:13 You're the one who brought bump stocks up, my point is that AR's are useful firearms that can be used for a variety of needs and regulating them isn't going to solve the issue of mass shootings
293 2018-03-25 21:18:11 My stocks are flying through the God damn roof, son.

295 2018-03-25 21:16:29 Why is it necessarily negative to sell a valuable collectible as opposed to say, other assets such as real estate, stocks or other investments? Maybe its more of an issue of one's own priorities at the moment as opposed  to poor financial advice or spending discipline.
296 2018-03-25 21:16:27 Even Amazon is trying to get rid of Bump Stocks, on their own.  Can't buy them in FL

298 2018-03-25 21:15:25 I could possibly get behind tighter regulations on bump stocks, although I doubt that would increase safety. “Assault style” rifles just semi auto rifles) are no more dangerous than many other types and used in a fraction of the the number of shootings as handguns are...

301 2018-03-25 21:14:39 It's like investing in stocks. Sure, you can make money from it, but it's a waste of life.

303 2018-03-25 21:14:12 Yet they make proposals that do not address the primary issue. Following Parkland they have proposed limiting bump stocks, high capacity magazines, and those on the terror-watch list.
None of those applied to the MSD shooting.
304 2018-03-25 21:13:58 A ban on assault weapons (and no, you can't divert me with bullshit about "what's an assault weapon), high-capacity magazines, cop-killer bullets, bump stocks, strict background checks, etc. are all constitutional. Even Scalia said so, in the Heller decision gun fondlers love

307 2018-03-25 21:12:59 You're too stupid to know the difference between gun control and gun confiscation. 

The Parkland kids have clearly laid out their plans: Ban assault weapons, bump stocks & large magazines, make background checks better & universal and raise the minimum age for buying guns.
308 2018-03-25 21:12:31 @Mastercard Follow Citigroups example and stop doing business with any retailer that sells guns to people under 21, or that sells bump stocks or extended magazines.

311 2018-03-25 21:11:45 I don't want people to have their guns taken away if they're responsible with them, but I'd like to see better background checks, gun show loopholes closed, bump stocks made illegal... It shouldn't be easier to get a gun than a drivers license.

314 2018-03-25 21:09:32 Overall gun violence decreased during Obama’s term but mass shootings using ARs and the like significantly increased. That’s why we support the ban. High cap mags, bump stocks, etc need to go.
315 2018-03-25 21:09:07 Bump stocks, and fully automatic weapons aren't civil rights.  Neither is any particular model of guns.  You're talking points would only be relevant if there was a proposal to ban all guns.
316 2018-03-25 21:08:57 I’ve seen a few proposals. Banning bump stocks and banning AR-15’s or raising the age limit on AR purchases. Are those the main substantive ideas being pushed by the marchers?
317 2018-03-25 21:08:49 We’re in the 21st century arguing an 18th century law. There are no militias and ppl do have a right to protect themselves but not with bump stocks, AK 47s, or any military style weapon. Reform is needed! Blue wave is headed your way! #MarchForOurLives
318 2018-03-25 21:08:26 How many with AR-15s with bump stocks? 
319 2018-03-25 21:08:06 Nobody is talking of banning guns altogether.  The main points I see most often are:
Banning assault style weapons
Mandatory, in-depth background checks.
No guns for people with restraining orders against them or on do-not-fly list or with diagnosed mental issues
Ban bump stocks
320 2018-03-25 21:07:59 This .... is not entirely false. But it is also way not the whole story. How about: "Let's study gun violence" (nope). "Could we ban bump-stocks?" (nope). "Raise the age from 18-21?" (nope).
321 2018-03-25 21:06:31 Trump already executive  ordered the sale of bump stocks
322 2018-03-25 21:06:26 First bump stocks and then speed loaders for revolvers
323 2018-03-25 21:05:59 @NRA  what is your position in accessories and ammo?  Are they covered by the 2A?   Would limiting the type of ammo to subsonic speeds for long rifles be something your organization could support?  Have you also updated your stance on bump stocks?
324 2018-03-25 21:05:56 I don’t think banning semiautomatic rifles is a solution people will go for. One shot before reloading isn’t practical. Limiting size of clips, eliminating bump stocks, stricter background checks and mandatory training is where I would start
325 2018-03-25 21:05:10 Hang in there!  You are making a difference!  Let's get rid of those AR's and bump stocks..................let the hunters hunt with their rifles; people have revolvers for protection................we do NOT need AR's

But if you want to go there we can.... felons already can't purchase guns nor can they legally conceal. People r against banning bump stocks because of the wording

330 2018-03-25 21:01:24 Ok ban assault rifles, bigger mags and bump stocks but criminals don’t follow laws only law abiding citizens do. If someone wants get those things they still can . You can get on the internet and it will tell you how to get and make them !

332 2018-03-25 21:00:28 How are you going to ban sales of bump stocks when you can buy a 3D printer and design one in less than one hour or download a design in less than one minute?

If someone wants a bump stock, they can make a bump stock. There is less than no point.
333 2018-03-25 21:00:12 true, the NFA-ing of bump stocks has to be narrowly tailored to those devices. My Geissele triggers are cold-dead-hands material 
334 2018-03-25 20:59:36 @thedeckleedge stocks empty tins and empty half pans btw! But if you want a smaller tin, maybe upcycle a mints tin or something.
335 2018-03-25 20:59:28 These weapons can be modified with bump stocks to hold 8 clips. All accessible on the market. It’s just a matter of time before it gets worse and worse. Need to start somewhere, banning the AR-15 is just the obvious start point.
336 2018-03-25 20:59:22 ATF under Obama found ‘bump-stocks’ is a firearm ‘part’ and not regulated under Gun Control Act or National Firearms Act .... according to law (know what that is?). So much for Dems coming after your guns and 2nd amendment, huh? You and LaPierre are idiots
337 2018-03-25 20:59:15 Also I think we should pass a law that any restaurant manager who harasses an employee should be put in public stocks and we should let dogs pee on their legs for 48 hours on a first offense. 

I'm willing to negotiate on that one though.
338 2018-03-25 20:58:32 When are the stocks tutorials #AskBigT
339 2018-03-25 20:57:23 So Kyle where are you on banning bump stocks?  Where are you on a ban on assault weapons?  Or minimizing magazines?  Other than that what are you for?  I understand fed state and local failed, but still what other solutions do you think can work?
340 2018-03-25 20:57:18 Stocks are boring, slow and soon to be crashing into depression like lows. Get with the times grandpa. This is the beginning of the crypto era. Ain’t nobody got time for TD ameritrade and 10% gains 
341 2018-03-25 20:57:15 Certainly there are many people marching who are ignorant and/or have extreme opinions like "ban all guns," but while I don't know specifics I believe the focus here is restrictions on assault-style rifles, bump stocks, and high capacity magazines
342 2018-03-25 20:57:11 The guns nobody needs are M16s. We talk about the slaughter of humans and you talk about the color of the stocks? 

Somethings wrong with you.
343 2018-03-25 20:57:10 Sorry I included “semi automatic” under that moniker as well given you can buy a bump stock legally in most states making them fully auto easily.

That said it looks like bump stocks might get banned which would be a great step in the right direction.
344 2018-03-25 20:56:52 Omg. He was prsident a year ago and legalized bump stocks. #brainwashedyouth #boredom #videogames #anger

347 2018-03-25 20:52:32 Marching for specific causes such as banning of bump stocks or raising of minimum age to 21 is certainly not communist. Both measures our President actually agrees with. Please don’t judge and dismiss people based on their age.

350 2018-03-25 20:51:43 Wow
351 2018-03-25 20:51:19 for the trade to be acceptable to both sides, the “how much do you care about this” points have to be ~equal on both sides. Gun owners care about an AWB >>> more than they do bump stocks. My read is that an AWB is the reddest red line, an absolute no-go.
352 2018-03-25 20:51:18 In 2010, ATF determined  bump stocks did not meet required criteria to merit regulation under the Gun Control Act or  National Firearms Act
353 2018-03-25 20:51:04 you saying you're down to Just 3 conviction stocks?
which 3 Doc?
354 2018-03-25 20:50:53 #NRA jus curious, you do understand making bump stocks and weapons like the ar15 does not preclude your 2nd Amendment right?
355 2018-03-25 20:49:12 ..as a responsible gun owner, I’m not worried about anyone coming to confiscate my guns...but then I don’t have bump stocks or AR-15’s, or see any reason for folks to NEED them...
356 2018-03-25 20:47:10 A former ATF official Rick Vasquez who took part in the decision to approve bump stocks, told Politifact that to blame the administration implies that Obama or his then-attorney general Eric Holder were involved in the determination. They were not.
357 2018-03-25 20:46:27 So technically your tweet is accurate to say the Obama administration approved the sale of bumps stocks, but one must take note it was because at the time the law put in place by the ATF did not permit them to prohibit it.
358 2018-03-25 20:46:17 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to improve your ADHD
359 2018-03-25 20:46:16 Have someone read this to you zippy. No wall. He signed funding for planned parenthood. He is going to take your bump stocks away. He may cause a trade war which will make all that junk at Walmart u buy 2x as costly. He even gave chuck his tunnel. All that? You. Got. Played.
360 2018-03-25 20:46:06 When the _coccus_ first appeared in this country, it is said (vol. ii. p. 163) that it was more injurious to crab-stocks than to the apples grafted on them. [708] 'Mém. de la Soc.
361 2018-03-25 20:45:32 Actually in 2010 the @ATFHQ determined that because bump stocks don't have any moving parts they are a "firearm part" & could not be regulated as a firearm under existing gun laws. The ATF reached a similar conclusion in 2012.
362 2018-03-25 20:45:25 Yes, the world changed, and the rifles on your gun stocks didn't hold 50 rounds and weren't designed to spray bullets at people as fast as you can pull the trigger.

365 2018-03-25 20:44:00 Huh bump stocks were fine under obama right he could have banned them but didn’t
366 2018-03-25 20:43:33 There isn’t any such thing as an assault weapon, no military uses an AR. Bump stocks are dumb. I’ve got no use for them, but I don’t tend to want to make arbitrary laws based on emotions. I can support you in raising the age to buying guns to 21 if we can do the same for  voting.
367 2018-03-25 20:43:17 yes all guns are dangerous. they’re made to kill. but what you’re saying is add ons like bump stocks don’t make the gun able to do the harm faster & more efficiently? kk
368 2018-03-25 20:42:58 What these marchers don't seem to understand is once you compromise your position very rarely do you get it back. Today its bump-stocks, tomorrow you buy one round of ammo instead of two. Before long you are a slave to the people you gave your rights to.
369 2018-03-25 20:41:56 That’s false we all agree on mental health most agree on stronger background checks and we are willing to give up bump stocks our main concern is the ban of any rifle
370 2018-03-25 20:41:36 Here’s how it works..  No action for 20 yrs, then pushback on bump stocks, even.  It takes millions in marches for anything to happen.  Do you think they trust anything will be done now?  Times up!
371 2018-03-25 20:41:30 3 stocks
3 I own
3 I bought open market and NOT in placings 

Rationale keeps it simple #Knowthegame
372 2018-03-25 20:41:20 The Obama Administration legalized bump stocks.
373 2018-03-25 20:41:06 “Libs want shootings... Obama made bump stocks legal”

I truly despair for America when the 45 cult has taken the minds of so many. Get help pal.
374 2018-03-25 20:40:54 Some people may have lost their houses but if they had good protection and owned it for years, they werent taken. It wasnt that big of an event. I was 18 and had just graduated high school at the time and I don't remember much changing besides stocks. Lasted a few months
375 2018-03-25 20:40:18 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
376 2018-03-25 20:40:06 If your interested in starting a portfolio and don’t know what stocks to invest, shoot me a DM
377 2018-03-25 20:39:47 Because it is a f..king side show that would have not shown his an once of respect. He is the one outlawing bump stocks - he is the one saying to not be scared of the NRA - he is the only one that has actually done anything.
378 2018-03-25 20:39:22 This will also bring down Facebook stocks. Please contact the police immediately. If the CEO is contacting the police immediately, it is a professional.
379 2018-03-25 20:39:15 Those lawyers Trumps guys announced? Where are they? Can’t find WH? Or want a retainer the Russians can’t pay? Or Trumps stocks are tanking and he is short on cash?
380 2018-03-25 20:39:14 There was a hundred percent chance of losing the bet, so it's ok lol. Same as while investing in stocks
381 2018-03-25 20:38:38 So heres my take.
I support raising the age to buy a gun on your own to 21.
Complete a gun safety course and co signer for under 21
Universal background checks (families change)
3day waiting
Ban sale of and prosecute manufacture without a licence assault weapons
Bump stocks etc.
382 2018-03-25 20:37:37 Actually I'm right.  Bump stocks were not used in Parkland.  Trump reneged on raising the age to buy long guns. The group in question has been very careful NOT to call for bans (taking guns away).  Try again.
383 2018-03-25 20:37:11 Horrible tragedy but I hate to disagree,the weapon didn't wake up & decide to go to that school & kill, the demented individual did.  A gross failure across the board. Stricter control, ban bump stocks, tighter regulations on permits. Guns don't kill people, people kill people
384 2018-03-25 20:35:23 Eventually they will be ubiquitous. Altoins really need to be traded vs fiat instead of Bitcoin to succeed in my opinion. Imagine if stocks and currencies were based on the current price of gold. It would be madness.
385 2018-03-25 20:35:08 You doing a internet feed from there sir? I seen where they had 25 pure stocks. I'd pay good money to see that
386 2018-03-25 20:33:49 They’re not trying to take away guns, they just want stricter laws on them, ie better background and MH checks, no bump stocks etc. But are you now blaming law enforcement or parents? Your point is very unclear. Look at the lack of mass shootings elsewhere and their gun laws...
387 2018-03-25 20:33:17 $GSM speculation play , 5% upside tomorrow , bring it #cnbc #stockmarket #stocks #stocklife #money #win #madmoney
388 2018-03-25 20:32:51 Lmfao doesn't matter where the weapon came from, it's still illegal to own in those cities. So people are still getting guns illegally.  I support the ban of bump stocks and I support private party deals having to go through a licensed FFL.
389 2018-03-25 20:32:31 It isn’t inconceivable to interpret the young ladies words “give us an inch by banning bump stocks, and we will take a mile” as advocating for a gun ban.
390 2018-03-25 20:31:17 Look everyone, it's the neocon controlled opposition to the gun control. Quick Jonah, tell us when it's OK to start agreeing with the gun grabbers on bump stocks or whatever.
391 2018-03-25 20:30:27 Its a sting. You can't tell your enemy you're coming for them. You have to sneak up behind them. They need a distraction. Bump stocks, DACA, etc. Arrwst, then announce.
392 2018-03-25 20:30:14 Hey Node, always enjoy your videos. Since you deal in stocks as well as crypto, what do you think of what Genesis Vision doing? $GVT
393 2018-03-25 20:28:47 I support the 2nd Amendment. I also support a ban on semiautomatic weapons, bump stocks, and large capacity magazines. I don’t think there’s a 2nd Amendment conflict in holding that stance.
394 2018-03-25 20:28:43 I want Rubio & others to STOP exaggerating (lying about) the positions of these young people. Yesterday I heard: raise purchase age to 21, ban assault style weapons, ban high capacity ammo methods, ban bump stocks, universal background checks & waiting periods—not ban all guns.
395 2018-03-25 20:28:20 I like the idea of bump stocks being banned.
396 2018-03-25 20:27:41 That’s why they need bump stocks!
397 2018-03-25 20:27:33 and yet bump stocks & semi automatics go unchallenged
398 2018-03-25 20:27:28 Technology - bullish . Altcoins = speculation in the same boat with stocks,metals,forex,etc.
399 2018-03-25 20:27:21 + "You have to be patient. You need to be focused, and know how to deal with stocks.. and growth projections. You need to work hard.. and not, y'know, break down from all the stress that /will/ consume you."
400 2018-03-25 20:25:36 The law in place at the time did not allow the Obama Administration to prohibit the sale of bump stocks. Not the same as approval. Meanwhile, your dumb ass continues to rail against the previous administration rather than do anything to make the situation better. #NotMyPresident
401 2018-03-25 20:25:18 The whole point of the March is to demand gun reform due to the use of assault rifles and bump stocks in mass shootings and their accessibility. So, yeah, military-grade 
402 2018-03-25 20:25:13 Les Mills classes, amazing trainers and instructors, pools, sauna, cafe, salon...what more could anyone ask for?  LOVE this...my home away from home!

404 2018-03-25 20:23:55 "For criminal dedicated mass murder, assume Canadian screening would've provided obstacle, but not barrier. In Canada, Paddock’s arsenal would've had lower rate of fire: No bump stocks & smaller mags. For experienced shooter technical limits, make little difference." NationalPost
405 2018-03-25 20:23:12 Your idea of common ground is doing nothing....

The STOP School Violence Act doesn’t even mention guns. 

The CDC thing is just a clarification of a prior CDC Director comment. 

You didn’t ban bump stocks. The DOJ just decided to read the law differently. 

Do. Something.
406 2018-03-25 20:22:57 Libs wanted shootings. Is why Obama made bump stocks legal. They wanted it all to blow up, so they could swoop in and win control.
The political party that funds Planned Parenthood couldn't care less if a few lives are lost to win 2nd amendment destruction..
407 2018-03-25 20:22:41 If they ban bump stocks make sure the bill is not written so loosely they can ban anything they want when ever they want such as aftermarket triggers, trigger cranks, echo & binary triggers  This is a dangerous precedent & puts too much ambiguity into the restriction. #2A
408 2018-03-25 20:21:48 I just want to trade stocks & live up in the Hills, you can have the rest.
409 2018-03-25 20:21:05 You're wrong. I timed myself reading it aloud in 4.5 secs... 40 rounds in 4.5s is faster than a full auto .45ACP Uzi. Bump stocks can manage ~3/sec.
410 2018-03-25 20:21:03 That's your opinion,  I have many of them,  with bump fire stocks.  I enjoy shooting.  I don't hunt.   Look closely at my profile pic, look close.  It CAN shoot 600 hundred rounds a minute. Its legal.  Laser sights,  night sights,  red dot sites.  Al legal
411 2018-03-25 20:18:57 How are bump stocks protected by the nra? I'm asking honestly because I'd like to know the reasoning behind your outrage.
412 2018-03-25 20:18:18 Chinese steel production has been pretty strong lately, and demand has disappointed - that's why we're seeing very high steel stocks right now.
413 2018-03-25 20:17:15 I thought Chris Wallace really shied away from challening these two.  He didn’t even question the girl on her own comment about, give us an inch on bump stocks, we will take a mile...waste of an interview.
414 2018-03-25 20:16:24 The choice was, and is, still clear for me.  You may have preferred Hillary, but that didn't happen.  I'm wiling to sacrifice short-term pain for long-term gain.  You have lost nothing unless you have sold your stocks. You didn't gain when they were high either (unless sold).
415 2018-03-25 20:16:12 Toy guns will now come with bump stocks. #FakeToyFacts
416 2018-03-25 20:16:10 The best leverage with miners would be from those that are pure-plays, (or very nearly so,) and those that make a large loss at today's lousy silver prices! Better instead to buy stocks that are not producers yet, (and thus have less current risk,) but that do have an ag resource
417 2018-03-25 20:15:52 Nice try honey!  Obama passed a law to restrict gun sales to the mentally ill.  First thing Trump did is remove that restriction!  Go Figure!  Bump stocks ONLY got banned after MSD student and public pressure!  GOP and Trump refused, after Las Vegas, to address!#ImpeachTrumpNow
418 2018-03-25 20:15:23 I am Sur @facebook stocks are in many mutual funds we are the owners too. We all must continue demanded changes to FB
419 2018-03-25 20:14:48 So he didn’t say gun dealers ? It was Drug dealers correct 
And I’m pretty sure he put a ban on bump stocks already that turns semiautomatic weapons into automatic. Correct?
420 2018-03-25 20:13:42 I believe the bump stocks made him less lethal than semi auto would have been. Lives saved by a gun accessory that is primarily a recreational toy for tuning money into noise.
421 2018-03-25 20:12:52 The flower border is solid with cotswold pennycress, many of which are very small plants. As we say time and time again its now very important to have these back up stocks incase of disasters in wild locations due to various factors.
422 2018-03-25 20:12:44 Whatever Facebook. You know what you were doing. It was only problem was when Trump won. You knew you were getting into trouble and since you work for the Dems you sold stocks and are in damage control.
423 2018-03-25 20:12:03 So start from 100% gun rights absolutism, then say "no bump stocks" and pretend you moved toward common ground?  How about we start with 100% my opinion, I move negligibly, you refuse it and I blame you for failure to compromise.  I bet you wouldn't take too kindly to it.
424 2018-03-25 20:11:35 What the NRA says is somewhat irrelevant, they said they supported a ban on bump stocks too, then walked it back a day later. They react and incite as though the right were unlimited, even if they don't express it in those words. At least not publicly.
425 2018-03-25 20:11:33 A.Rifles (automatics like the M-16) are illegal & have been since 1986. "A.Weapons" are just ordinary rifles with adjustable stocks or vertical hand grips. The functionality is identical to, say, a deer rifle, so there's no reason to ban them.
426 2018-03-25 20:11:26 2 FBI calls, over 20 visits by cops/FBI to Cruz’s house, 4 sheriffs who refused to go into the building... etc. But let’s blame Trump and the NRA. Change is coming (ban on bump stocks... etc) but liberals still complain.
427 2018-03-25 20:09:23 The law defines what a dollar is. Previous to this legislation, by your example, you must have a reference to what a dollar is.
Ever wonder why until recently stocks were priced in 8ths? That pricing convention pre-dates dollar definition. Pieces of eight isn't just a movie term.
428 2018-03-25 20:09:14 Lol! We don't have proper stocks here either. 
429 2018-03-25 20:09:04 I will find the link. She was referencing bump stocks, then followed up with that.
430 2018-03-25 20:08:21 man i can't wait to see facebook stocks tomorrow
431 2018-03-25 20:07:49 @marcorubio It's only a start.  Get politicians fingers away from NRA cash.  I support 2nd Amendment rights (adopted in 1791).  BAN bump stocks & automatic weapons. Issue every NRA supporter a working replica of the muzzle loader my ancestor used to fight for our independence.
432 2018-03-25 20:07:44 Bump stocks should never have been legal in the first place since they effectively turn semi-automatic weapons into automatic ones which are already illegal.
433 2018-03-25 20:07:05 @realDonaldTrump  You lied - again - when you claim Obama approved bump stocks.  #SAD
434 2018-03-25 20:06:49 legalized bump stocks
435 2018-03-25 20:06:30 No one, outside of a war zone, needs access to assault rifles & bump stocks. Mental health sufferers should not be allowed to buy ANY firearm. Stricter, more in-depth background checks. Ban assault rifles. Ban bump stocks. Tax the damn @NRA .
436 2018-03-25 20:04:58 THAT IS A LIE!!  He DID NOT legalize bump stocks!!   #LiarInChief #TrumpColluded
437 2018-03-25 20:04:49 I am all for guns for sport, for hunting but not AR 15’s and the like or bump stocks or unlimited ammo. We also need to require all gun sales to have a waiting period and background check mental health check, license and registration.
438 2018-03-25 20:03:03 I’m totally pro-2A, however I’m not opposed to banning bump-stocks and instituting a short waiting period so a comprehensive background check can be done. I do not agree with bans on magazines or any semi-auto rifle.
439 2018-03-25 20:02:52 Patch 1.0.1: Falcon punch comes out frame 3, knees delete 2 stocks and down air spikes automatically win the game no matter what
440 2018-03-25 20:01:52 So I forgot that I set up an investment to take out 20 dollars a month and put it in stocks and I just found out I have like 300 dollars I didn't know about. Did i leave it in there or take it out to spend on booze?
441 2018-03-25 20:00:52 From the students who else dont u get it 14,15,16,17,18 yr old students arranged all this by signing transportation contracts emptying their piggy banks, emptying their trust funds bank accounts selling their stocks bonds&mutual funds 4 the privilege of destroying their freedoms
442 2018-03-25 19:59:20 Il paraît que TOTAL a organisé un renouvellement de son stock de bouteilles de gaz. Du coup, si ta bouteille date de 2017 en descendant les stations REFUSENT de récupérer de te servir du gaz.
INCROYABLE, Vous renouvellez vos stocks et les consommateurs supportent les pertes ???
443 2018-03-25 19:58:57 Bump stocks should be subject to the Cheney 1% doctrine.
444 2018-03-25 19:58:16 Pas de prob. J’te conseil d’attendre le Golden Week pour acheter des trucs aussi sur le site. Y’a souvent plus de 200 articles qui ont entre 10 a 80% de rabais. Mais faut faire vite car les stocks partent très vite ahahah (et le site crash car y’a trop de demande)
445 2018-03-25 19:58:10 You are also probably twisting the Bible as you twist the meaning of the Constitution.  President Trump supported the March For Our Lives. Trump is banning bump stocks, harder background checks. Safe Schools, Gun Reform IS COMING. When you die, God will tell you he is not in NRA.
446 2018-03-25 19:57:47 I am anti #NRA. I don't want to take all guns. Just automatic weapons, high-capacity clips, and bump stocks. Nobody uses these weapons for self-defense. They use them to murder human beings
447 2018-03-25 19:57:37 There are cops ,soldiers, vets, hunters,  etc who are saying civilians don't need and should not have semi-automatic rifles like the AR-15 which can be turned into fully automatic rifles with bump stocks. They are too much like military weapons. #BanAssaultWeapons
448 2018-03-25 19:57:06 Stocks long term are better than real estate
449 2018-03-25 19:55:51 So you took the least of the points that I raised. Got it. Typical tactic. I have no interest in bump stocks, other than making sure that they remain legal.
450 2018-03-25 19:55:45 Actually, yesterday he tweeted that his plan to end sale of bump stocks is happening. It may not be the exact change you want, but it's a great step toward a compromise.
451 2018-03-25 19:55:39 If stocks tank his stock tanks.
452 2018-03-25 19:55:39 Yes exactly he won't give any tips to buy stocks .
453 2018-03-25 19:55:34 KM protests have made Canadian energy stocks too risky for investors.
454 2018-03-25 19:55:29 I'm not part if the NRA either and one look at Dianne Feinstein's bill says otherwise.

"To ban the use of "assault weapons, telescopic or fixed stocks and a handguard" 

That's every single semi automatic weapon out there.
455 2018-03-25 19:54:51 How many mass shootings were bump stocks used?? ONE.

How many mass shootings was there that used 10 round or less magazines?? Lots.

So you, Erin, makes no sense.
456 2018-03-25 19:54:18 I mean, that's basically how I imagin Frieza stocks up on minions. Sold locally!
457 2018-03-25 19:54:02 That’s fair. It’s not what I got from anything else you said. When I read “gun safety” I assumed he meant some of the proposals I’ve heard (ARban, background checks, bump stocks etc.) If indeed he literally means “gun safety” then I agree he’s being misleading at best.
458 2018-03-25 19:53:44 I literally grew up hunting. Looks like we agree. Bump stocks are worthless for hunting or target practice. But in close quarters, they are very effective at spraying bullets into a crowd of people.

Again, we can outlaw firearm accessories without violation constitution.
459 2018-03-25 19:52:35 I'm not sure why you're trying to start an argument here? I'm a gun owner. I grew up with guns. I hunted. Militarized weapons, previously banned assault weapons, bump stocks, and high capacity magazines need to be unavailable to civilians. All gun sales should be subject to a >
460 2018-03-25 19:52:33 "Shall not be infringed" applies to bump stocks. We won't give them up.
461 2018-03-25 19:52:28 So are you against Trump’s call to ban bump stocks?
462 2018-03-25 19:52:00 Actually we do get to tell people what they can and can't have.  There are limits on the type of firepower you are allowed to have. 

Silencers are not legal. Any accessory to your firearm is not protected by the constitution. Bump stocks, large capacity mags, etc. No protection
463 2018-03-25 19:51:25 A se demander si ce n'est pas les allemands qui on commandité l'assassinat de l'espion russe en GB, ils avaient encore des stocks de Ziclon B non?
464 2018-03-25 19:50:28 So, bump stocks are your problem, me too. You're right though, those guns do have considerably higher recoil, however, a competent & trained shooter can fire accurately at a very fast rate. And that caliber rifle is also available in models that can equip a magazine.
465 2018-03-25 19:50:11 I’m defo miles behind but I just found out that Asos now stocks MAC and I’m so happy 
466 2018-03-25 19:49:39 We need to close loopholes that allow people to buy ghost guns, too.  I don't think our fore fathers had; ghost guns, bump stocks & assault rifles in mind when they quilled the #2A  when they did.  Nor did they EVER imagine an entity like the NRA having control of govt.
467 2018-03-25 19:48:33 "We want to ban bump stocks!"

And this will be enforced how? It's not like they won't be available after any ban. Hell, it's not like they won't be made after any ban. Avenues shift, but that's all. Good luck with that compliance.
468 2018-03-25 19:48:25 His body guards not going to like no more high capacity mags. Assault weapons ban then why bump stocks sure you put it on a assault
469 2018-03-25 19:48:05 This is a lie.  Bump stocks were not "legalized."  Certainly not by Obama.
470 2018-03-25 19:47:44 Obama administration did no such thing, and YOU are the reason bump stocks were not already illegal.
471 2018-03-25 19:47:34 If you haven't yet, buy CANNABIS coins and stock. You'll thank me later. #DYOR but these babies will be 10x, 20x, 50x, 100x and 1000x coins and stocks. Promise.
472 2018-03-25 19:46:51 You obviously have never hunted and probably don't even own a gun.
Bump stocks are worthless if actually like to hit something you're aiming at.....but you nor I have a right to tell those who want it that they can't have it, just because we dislike it or find it impractical
473 2018-03-25 19:46:29 No civilian needs semi-automatic or automatic weapons, bump stocks, armor piercing bullets, etc.  Unless the deer have them first!
474 2018-03-25 19:45:12 "President Trump directed the Department of Justice to propose rulemaking on bump stocks as expeditiously as possible." @GOP @POTUS
475 2018-03-25 19:44:46 Hey Marco, why not bring back the "Tommy Gun", why not allow grenades and rocket launchers? If assault weapons/weapons of war, large magazines, bump stocks, are banned, there is no infringement of 2A rights. If no ban or serious chamges, good luck to Republicans in  November...
476 2018-03-25 19:43:30 1-bump stocks can be mocked by simply wrapping your thumb in your belt loop
2- high capacity mags, it takes 2 seconds to change a mag
3- assault rifles are already illegal, can’t be any more illegal
477 2018-03-25 19:43:29 I agree 100%. He just lied for 2 1/2  yrs to his base that he was bldg a WALL. Instead he gave military contractors the wall money. He needs to go. Base stay home he’s a liar. I don’t give 2 shits about stocks, de-reg...it was the WALL that got him there. Dump Trump 2020
478 2018-03-25 19:43:23 They're suing to block a bill banning bump stocks in Florida. Strange way of showing support.
479 2018-03-25 19:42:28 I can't wait for Monday's CNBC headlines. 

"Stocks get nailed on Stormy Daniels interview. "

"Stocks up hard on Stormy Daniels 60 minutes piece."
480 2018-03-25 19:42:20 Ok I'll bite, what is an assault weapon?  I don't have a short memory I am just trying to make a point that the anti-gun crowd will not be happy until all guns are banned. I have no problem with banning bump stocks or arresting people for modifying semi auto weapons to fire 1/2
481 2018-03-25 19:42:00 @SkimmerMotion I have a Skimmer Motion that I love (when it’s working). I’ve had it less than a year and it’s falling apart. Pinch-a-Penny no longer stocks it. The crown is snapped and the floaters are coming off. Help!
482 2018-03-25 19:41:15 What will the $SPY do in the week ahead after last week’s sell-off? $SPY $QQQ $IWM #markets #stocks
483 2018-03-25 19:41:00 When you say that Obama legalized bump stocks, you turn the matter into a lie.  During the Obama admin. the BATF determined that bump stocks were not regulated under current law- different thing than what you claim. Couldn't make something legal that wasn't illegal to begin with.
484 2018-03-25 19:40:07 Negative... Sell ur stocks Zuck, the younger generations don’t even use facebook. Future not looking bright.
485 2018-03-25 19:39:23 Stocks and stocks....  Yeiy!
486 2018-03-25 19:38:34 1.7%.  You forgot to include the 0.2% of the Uber rich who own stocks, get dividends and now pay lower taxes.
487 2018-03-25 19:38:31 Between 30 Sept 2017 &  31 Jan 2018, Global X #Uranium ETF $URA grew from US$263M to US$391M Net Assets, an increase of US$128M +49% in 4 months. Global X plowed US$128M into buying its components, accelerating the rally in U stocks it holds. Expect same on next catalyst.
488 2018-03-25 19:38:11 In order to remove bump stocks, you need to erase the brains of over two million+ US citizens.  Then take down over 100 websites containing tutorials on ‘how to do it.’  Good luck with that.
489 2018-03-25 19:38:11 •Background checks & registration thru local police dept. 
•Free Gun safety classes
•Dept. should have computer system that runs thru Federal data base just like No Fly list
•7 day waiting period
• Ban bump stocks/High capacity Magazines
•Ban AR-15 & similar military grade
490 2018-03-25 19:37:35 Ban of bump stocks (modifiers, which is supposedly already happening), assault weapons ban, ban of high cap magazines, universal background checks). Common sense.  No weapons of war (& mags), no modifiers that turn legal guns into illegal machine guns, & background checks.
491 2018-03-25 19:37:24 Buy all HQ stocks
492 2018-03-25 19:37:18 @SeanWilsonChef do you know anywhere in york stocks your cheese got some on Xmas market dad loves how’s ya farther

495 2018-03-25 19:36:23 Bump stocks have been banned ...keep up
496 2018-03-25 19:35:30 limits to go up, mental illness to be determined, and dump stocks to be illegal. We will continue to see these mass shootings and this government will continue to throw us little bones to appease. Do I hope for a ban? Absolutely! Will I ever see one? Probably not.
497 2018-03-25 19:35:09 Anybody know any good AI stocks? Some reading or where to find info would be even better
498 2018-03-25 19:34:53 #alt-NRA -- Yep, I think bonafide hunters within the NRA should start an alt-NRA, for those people who want to have guns, but also want to ban assault rifles, bump stocks, and guns like that.
499 2018-03-25 19:34:51 They wanted this to blow up. Ever think about that? Should. Why else did OBAMA make bump stocks legal? 

They wanted this.

They didn't care who died. A few lives don't matter to the political party that funds Planned Parenthood.

This was part of an overall plan..
500 2018-03-25 19:34:49 $BYOC $SGDH Looking forward to watching these long term stocks this week. Patience is key. Hope everyone had a nice weekend. 
501 2018-03-25 19:34:42 We want improvement and changes also. Starting with better parenting and mental health checks. Ban bump stocks no one cares its an accessory. Just like your case on your phone you use to text and drive .
502 2018-03-25 19:34:04 Giancarlo Rodriguez Arizona high school senior quotes usual “People kill People,not guns”. But if they didn’t have high cap magazines, bump stocks, etc. PEOPLE WITH GUNS COULDN’T KILL SO MANY SO FAST. Most gun owners r not killers but they don’t need high cap mags or bump stocks.
503 2018-03-25 19:34:01 I'm trying to re-order glycerol to make freezer stocks, and there are 68 options. Help.
504 2018-03-25 19:33:37 I was just thinking that even before elections might change and bring a Congress that is more favorable to having an impact on guns that campaigners are already having some limited impact, w legislative change in Florida and Trump's moves on bump stocks.
505 2018-03-25 19:33:36 The market trouble is being caused by the inflationary policy of the Federal Reserve, and the stocks are overvalued.  Even though he inherited this problem, he shouldn't be promoting a rising stock market because the declines will be the fault of Trump, the GOP, and deregulation.
506 2018-03-25 19:33:10 raise the legal age to buy or own a gun, make parents be held responsible for their kids if their kids get a gun and shoot someone, ban all semi automatic weapons and bump stocks, have an armed resource officer in every hallway of every school, bullet proof doors in every class.
507 2018-03-25 19:32:33 AR stands for Armour Light but is a semi automatic version of the M16. Bump Stocks make it the same.
508 2018-03-25 19:31:43 Half the world did not even know about bump stocks until this. So banning them will help but it won’t make a difference.
509 2018-03-25 19:31:07 Just saw how my stocks did on Friday...gonna get back to drinking now 
510 2018-03-25 19:30:34 Bump stocks are almost NEVER used in any shooting. There has only been one significant shooting to date in which a bump stock wad used, and that was the Vegas shooting.
511 2018-03-25 19:30:05 Put the bumpstocks on the NFA and make tax money from them and have that registration of who has them. Take short barrels and supressor off. They aren't whisper quiet. That's Hollywood b.s. the NFA in and of itself is unconstitutional. Bump stocks have been around for 20 years
512 2018-03-25 19:29:11 Trump has already said bump stocks will be banned so q is what else might happen before November as well.
513 2018-03-25 19:28:53 I dont need 4 stocks bro
514 2018-03-25 19:28:51 Just so you know, bump stocks can be made at home. Making them illegal is ridiculous! But, I totally agree with the rest of what you said.
515 2018-03-25 19:28:34 Yes. In Illinois they are considering confiscating guns from 18-20 year olds. You know what FL did, and Trump is getting ready to ban bump stocks. Bump firing is a technique, not a part so the law will have to be vaguely worded. The antis will exploit that like they always do.
516 2018-03-25 19:28:26 Yeah, from the hip with one finger. Hip firing is wildly inaccurate. Bump stocks let you accurately fire from the shoulder while properly holding the weapon.
517 2018-03-25 19:28:25 Invest in @ZHVXCIX stocks...its only on the come up
518 2018-03-25 19:28:15 Oh Sue, don’t B a puppet! Do your own research. Watch the traumatized children’s speeches & see that they want you to keep your guns. They just want #AR15’s & bump stocks gone! #GodsWatchingYou! Don’t mock the kids. Hopefully all of U mocking these beautiful kids, R not parents!
519 2018-03-25 19:28:10 I mean, I agree... I’m ignorant on the subject but if I was forced to make policy based on what little I know, I’d guess rifles/shotguns are fine, rifles which hold lots of bullets some regulation (ie bump stocks or w/e), and mostly direct my energy towards handguns
520 2018-03-25 19:28:01 Hey @cocacola what are you guys phasing out Barq’s or what? Gotta drive two hours just to find a place that stocks it, and then not regularly; restaurants seem to be pulling it. What gives?
521 2018-03-25 19:27:59 @HaloTopCreamery hi how come you have 16 assorted flavours in the UK but only Tesco stocks your product and only sells at max 4 flavours? I would love to try the other flavours!
522 2018-03-25 19:27:22 Obama did not legalize bump stocks.
523 2018-03-25 19:26:53 Sounds like the actual number is 2. 17 year old with handgun killed two and was stopped by armed officer- banning 'assault' rifles, raising age to 21, banning bump stocks etc wouldn't have changed this. But no one wants to talk about underlying problems with society.
524 2018-03-25 19:25:13 Trump misinformation! Bump stocks are “parts” and not regulated like firearms under existing regulations. The NRA lobbied to keep them unregulated.  Any knowledgeable gun enthusiast knows this!!!  What happened to Obama will take your guns away? Doesn’t fit your current reality?
525 2018-03-25 19:23:52 Common ground for these gun kooks include high capacity magazines, bump stocks, AR-15's, concealed carry across all state borders, and forcing guns into every nook and cranny of American society.
526 2018-03-25 19:23:47 There was no mention of Trump and Sessions criminalizing bump stocks yesterday from what I saw.
527 2018-03-25 19:23:38 I agree wholeheartedly. For me (and this is my opinion of the subject) by banning bump stocks the President took away an argument from anti-gunners. He says I banned these terrible things (which wasn’t a real problem to begin with) now they can only say it wasn’t enough
528 2018-03-25 19:23:03 Instriguing. My current ED stocks tourniquets. Very few have any clue how to use them. Previous MTC job had tourniquets and celox. No trauma or field dressings. Mend and make do approach.
529 2018-03-25 19:22:22 Erm ok let’s get the stocks  out first eh
530 2018-03-25 19:22:03 Oh so they "corageously" believe that civilians (including domestic abusers) should have Ar-15s with no universal background check, access to bump stocks, and no magazine limit? If they're not paid off then they're just immoral and I can't wait for them to get voted out.
531 2018-03-25 19:21:56 That brat saying if we ban bump stocks, it will cause them to move the goalposts and demand more and more is enough to make me hate her.
532 2018-03-25 19:21:52 What will happen around 5th of april. I was just planning to btfd on stocks tomorrow
533 2018-03-25 19:20:59 I’ve never used a bump stock but I can assume it would be fun. Though, I can also see how they could be a serious threat. I’m on the fence with bump-stocks. It’s unfortunate that we have to regulate everything so severely bc ppl can’t control their mental instability.
534 2018-03-25 19:20:49 No one is going to take all you guns for Gds sake. No more military style weapons. No bump stocks or version of them. One restriction doesn’t mean total ban. You are all so dense
535 2018-03-25 19:20:48 Ohh good one. So your baseline expectations for MU is the NIT.  You MU fans are so insufferable it’s comical. UW doesn’t make the tournament for the first time in 20 years and you would think MU is in the final four.
536 2018-03-25 19:20:14 In one interview, I saw him call Dana Loesch the CEO of the NRA, said the Republican Congress legalized bump stocks, and went on to slander many people. He's very ignorant and terribly nasty on top of it.
537 2018-03-25 19:20:03 Anybody want to tell this hypocrite what we're marching for? I'll start:

1) Universal Background Checks: Only 9 states + DC require them for all firearms
2) Improve data sharing
3) Red Flag laws
4) Prohibit those on no-fly & terror watch lists
5) Ban bump stocks
6) #VoteThemOut
538 2018-03-25 19:19:48 Ban bump stocks. Casualties diminish by at least half. Ban large magazines. Casualties go down again.
539 2018-03-25 19:19:09 Need more black businesses more enlightening 
It’s a reason stocks, credit, etc not taught in grade school
540 2018-03-25 19:18:37 Sumthin up ! Mark Zuckerburg got caught selling his all FB stocks.  Hmm
541 2018-03-25 19:17:42 We don't need any new gun legislation. We need to enforce the laws on the books now. So yes I'm opposed to banning bump stocks.
542 2018-03-25 19:17:39 I knew everything in the world from money and stocks to education and government was corrupt just by the way the average person treated me.
543 2018-03-25 19:17:27 Good days golf today @BawtryGolfClub for the first round of the 2018 season.. @ollietronic opens up the defence of his title with a count back victory over stocks after both getting 35pts.. #SocietyGolfers
544 2018-03-25 19:16:55 If Euro falls, oil becomes incredibly expensive to use, stocks may fall, then bonds become junk bonds.

Dollar rises against euro, falls against yuan ? Stocks fall ? Bonds rise and fall ? USA rises with consumer spending ?

Speculation, only one scenario still.
545 2018-03-25 19:16:13 Wouldn't surprise me. And I think you're right, confiscations or amendment changes aren't happening or feasible but I bet you'll see more checks required at a federal level and I don't think that's a bad thing (and bans on buzzword items like 'bump stocks' which are irrelevant)
546 2018-03-25 19:15:39 Prognosis normally:

$BTC and stocks will go up hand in hand next week. $BTC probably towards main resistance line high in the 9000's.

After this week, around the 5th of April the correlation should switch --> stock markets going down and crypto going up.
547 2018-03-25 19:15:06 We like to buy stocks which we feel are undervalued and then we have to have the guts to buy more when they go down. -- Walter Schloss
548 2018-03-25 19:15:02 Banning assault weapons ,bump stocks/extended magazines, more extensive background checks, online instantaneous database for those checks. More mental health screenings for people getting concealed permits/licenses.
549 2018-03-25 19:14:48 Where do you get this crap that you peddle!?!  Remember when your false right wing rant was that Obama wanted to take your hunting rifle?  Now he invented bump stocks.  Do you see your own foolishness?  Do you care?
550 2018-03-25 19:14:36 Great. Then I can assume you’re not upset about banning bump-stocks.
551 2018-03-25 19:14:30 Pop said Trump didn't meet with the kids.  Trump did meet with Parkland survivors not long after the shooting.  But that doesn't fit with Pop's lefty talking points.  want gun confiscation and said so yesterday.  The Gonzalez girl said if we ban bump stocks, they want more.  No.
552 2018-03-25 19:14:05 Perhaps ban the materials to make them automatic, bump stocks, cranks? Also most semiauto firearms cannot be safely modified in structure  to be fully auto. To do so btw is illegal.
553 2018-03-25 19:13:59 I was at two marches yesterday and they were incredibly powerful. I’ve also been a member of @MomsDemand for 3 years. We should outlaw bump stocks, limit magazine capacity, and ban military style assault weapons. Congress has to do better to protect our kids.
554 2018-03-25 19:13:06 Sunday review- happy with position & holdings in all my stocks, not so happy with current sp of many due to market push down to date, however, nothing materially changed on any (been good news in fact on some! mm's giving little) not adding or selling, holding pattern applied 
555 2018-03-25 19:12:56 Let’s break this down for u Ruby. No one wants to take away ur guns.Just no crazies or no fly listers. No assault rifle bump stocks, or actually no weapons of war for civ’s (would be great, but NRA would smell toast).Teachers aren’t , so leave them out of this.so hard?
556 2018-03-25 19:12:41 The horrific terrorist attack that happened in Las Vegas occurred Oct 2017.  That domestic terrorist used bump stocks.  WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?  Obama AND Trump admin ATF could not make bump stocks illegal based on existing law.  Showing your ignorance/blame game is ridiculous
557 2018-03-25 19:11:17 @blupien 

I' m interested in resource stocks, can you please recommend me some promising stocks in the cobalt copper and gold sector. What do you think about GPY and SCY?
Kind Regards
Harald
558 2018-03-25 19:11:08 Aren't you cherry picking yourself?  How many shootings used bump stocks?  One.  No one, including politicians, knew what they were before Vegas and they quickly banned them.
559 2018-03-25 19:10:22 Our student's marching and Rally's are working.  Here are some of the legislation and new laws that were just put into place (1) Friday DOJ banned bump stocks which turns legal weapons into illegal machine guns (2) 23 March the Fix NICS Act was signed into law which strengthens
560 2018-03-25 19:09:55 I got a hard on and want to trade stocks, #billions is back, s03 :) #aktier #stocks
561 2018-03-25 19:09:46 banir bump stocks, magazines, qualquer acessório ou componente de arma na era dos 3d printers é pedir para o mercado ir underground...
562 2018-03-25 19:08:16 yall are disgusting ill fight this to my death
563 2018-03-25 19:08:13 Is the deaths of 58 people by a law abiding gun owner insignificant to you because it doesn’t fit your narrative? Paddock bought military style weapons and bump fire stocks legally and wouldn’t have had any of them if we had better regulations!
564 2018-03-25 19:07:10 You can buy bump stocks and other attachments tho man that allow those AR’s to become practically automatic. Las Vegas? That’s exactly what he did.  I know that’s not what he is saying here but what do you think about that?
565 2018-03-25 19:07:06 “If you are shopping for common stocks, choose them the way you would buy groceries, not the way you would buy perfume.” Benjamin Graham
566 2018-03-25 19:07:00 Growth stocks, RS leaders... $SGH $EC $KL $VNOM $CLR $COP $MTCH $QDEL $COUP $HEI $BFAM $PAGS $PTCT $SRPT $JOBS $GDOT $VIRT. Select names of interest. Not a buy list.
567 2018-03-25 19:06:07 Trump is banning bump stocks and switching the age to buy an AR from 18-21... Going against the NRA.. but it's all still trumps fault
568 2018-03-25 19:05:58 Well my stocks are taking a “ trump dump” thank you much
569 2018-03-25 19:05:32 1) Do you support background checks?

2) Do you support  7-10 waiting period? 

3) Do U support closing loopholes for purchases at gun shows or internet? 

4) Do U support ban on bump stocks or accessory that is deemed by ATF as making it automatic weapon?

5) Age requirements ?
570 2018-03-25 19:05:12 And before you say bump stocks it’s still one bullet per trigger pull.
571 2018-03-25 19:05:04 This is the problem. Every time the phrase "gun control" gets mentioned, you automatically hear "BAN" even when the word isn't said. We're talking about REGULATIONS. Stricter background checks, mental health screenings, bump stocks, etc. Banning ARs isn't the focus of gun control
572 2018-03-25 19:04:58 Too many HFs have been conditioned to "buy the dip" in the FANG stocks. They will likely meet their doom in this one. Hedge funds nowadays have become not contrarian thinking nimble operators that they used to be, but high fee marketing machines that chase latest trends.
573 2018-03-25 19:04:49 Careful or they’ll put us in the stocks
574 2018-03-25 19:04:33 Curious to see how the sale of bump stocks have done over the last couple days.
575 2018-03-25 19:03:22 It appears you haven't been paying attention... Listen to the kids, they are very clearly saying what they want;
  Universal background checks (close private sale & gun show loopholes)
  Ban on military style semi & auto rifles, bump stocks, etc
  Limited 10 shot mag
  Nationwide
576 2018-03-25 19:03:00 We don't need AR-15s on the street!  OR BUMPER  STOCKS!   
577 2018-03-25 19:02:43 Also the man who legalised bump stocks
578 2018-03-25 19:02:31 It’s not about “losing a skirmish.” He had the option to veto this disasterous omnibus and chose not to.  He also didn’t need to push a ban on bump stocks. You cannot blame this on the RINOs... Trump has angered a lot of his most loyal supporters by himself!
579 2018-03-25 19:02:05 okay. I have that in my group of stocks
580 2018-03-25 19:01:18 Isn’t the point of the AR-15 the velocity achieved is so deadly. Bump stocks may have the volume of bullets, but an AR-15 creates horror all by itself.
581 2018-03-25 19:00:41 If a country has the highest rate of death by gun violence despite Gun laws what should they do?
- Nothing
- Pass Gun Safety Laws inc.  universal backgrounds, age req, mandatory wait pds, registration, ban assault weapons, bump stocks & large capacity magazines & close loopholes
582 2018-03-25 19:00:25 Your assumption side 2 doesn't care about children's safety is specious. We disagree about the why and the how-to-fix-it. Every mass shooter EVER was a criminal. In other words, they broke the law. What makes you believe they will obey if AR-15 and bump stocks are banned? (2/2)
583 2018-03-25 18:58:05 As much as I want to #MAGA, please don’t insult my intelligence in the process. Obama didn’t legalize bump stocks; under the current laws, by the mechanisms, they didn’t violate any current laws. In fact, if you play around with a semi, you don’t even need a bump stock.
584 2018-03-25 18:57:14 Being bullish on $Crypto and bearish on stocks is a strange feeling ... 
585 2018-03-25 18:56:40 Go ahead; ban bump stocks. Maybe mass shooters will discard the AR-15 as a weapon of choice. These 2 things seems inexorably linked in your mind. Here's a video of a @GLOCKInc 19 with a 30-round magazine. Hint: Semi-automatic, 30 rounds, no bump stock. (1/2)
586 2018-03-25 18:56:40 (3) Friday DOJ banned bump stocks which turns legal weapons into illegal machine guns.  This is from researching because I needed to know if changes were happening.  And they are working big time.  What else do we want
587 2018-03-25 18:55:49 Ok, let's don't single them out. NO bump stocks, NO clips that can wipe out a room full of kids without a reload and strict background checks that actually work.
588 2018-03-25 18:55:08 I agree with most of her message. In fact, bump stocks just got banned in the omnibus bill. So that’s a start, but not enough. But let me be perfectly clear. I’m not going to start being okay with oppressive government symbols being normalized, no matter who is wearing it. Sorry.
589 2018-03-25 18:54:33 None of these had that. Bump stocks yes. And i am all for those being banned.
590 2018-03-25 18:54:18 Good morning got some more studding to do having a little problem catching stocks after they break out but working on fixing it
591 2018-03-25 18:53:55 Another thing. The days of tweeting a headline to get a lift in your stocks are over!!!! I`m laughing @ satan as I see him having a temper tantrum.  : ]
592 2018-03-25 18:53:52 Yes Bof E still pouring out billions in FLS and TFS and refuse to see that savers cannot and will not spend ...i am sick of the struggle to gain an income even stocks are useless
593 2018-03-25 18:53:07 My precious Chinese tech stocks continue to get bent over bigly by the Teflon Don
594 2018-03-25 18:52:54 You can Ben, though it would mean you can only use £16,000 to a stocks ISA as our maximum ISA allowance is £20,000.
595 2018-03-25 18:52:44 Okay is it just me or does this not matter at all, sorry trump love you and all but listen the people that have an interest in bump stocks already have them. So my question is are you stopping producing these items because that is the only way to make a difference.
596 2018-03-25 18:51:54 I am for the 2nd amendment, but banning bump stocks is a very good idea.
597 2018-03-25 18:51:49 I haven’t checked my stocks in a while
598 2018-03-25 18:51:45 Multiple reasons, some people getting coins stuck on stocks or other problems. We think it's better for people to just stay away from stocks and delisting is a great way to do so.
599 2018-03-25 18:50:52 No one who understands Luke Gromen's thesis would ever make mention of a "gold-backed yuan." China has no intention whatsoever of backing its currency with its state gold reserves. The gold/yuan contract at the SGEI, HK, and Dubai would draw gold from *western* stocks.
600 2018-03-25 18:50:46 Perhaps, but I still believe bump stocks should be illegal. I lean libertarian so I say this only because I believe it infringes on other people’s right to life and liberty.
601 2018-03-25 18:50:43 It could happen as hinted in tweets: national defense
602 2018-03-25 18:50:16 yes i understand. But i have no problems with Stocks and like the way the have made the exchange. Maybe in the future when they have solved some issues you may come back.
603 2018-03-25 18:50:07 If you're staking your bet on what know about guns by repeatedly using the terms #AR15 and #bumpstock I'd say that doesn't prove you know much about guns at all. Frankly, if banning bump stocks would make side 1 go away and leave gun-owners (side 2?) alone, I'm all for it.
604 2018-03-25 18:49:51 It's great for trafficking but the libel laws will bring down social media. That's why they are dumping stocks. It also will harm the victims as they no longer will have a voice. Lawyers cannot be trusted. Social media is OVER.
605 2018-03-25 18:48:55 You invest in other stocks? Besides through 401k at work. I just started this year on my own, using Stash. Extremely user friendly for noobs like myself lol
606 2018-03-25 18:48:54 How do u know that there is just 10 to 20 stocks available ? Even u Don't know that @Flipkart is also doing something wrong here. And the demand is very high for all mi phones
607 2018-03-25 18:48:47 Agree that bump stocks should be illegal.
No argument there.

611 2018-03-25 18:48:19 Lol selling all time low uranium stocks right before the big move up, very smart
612 2018-03-25 18:47:52 SandyHook killer didn't use a bump stock
Aurora theater killer didn't use a bump stock
Parkland killer didn't use a bump stock 
Pulse killer didn't use a bump stock 
Columbine killers didn't use bump stocks
Virginia Tech killer didn't use a bump stock 

Notice a trend here?
613 2018-03-25 18:47:41 Not it is not. It was designed as a military grade version of the M16, only as a semi-automatic. And w bump stocks, it becomes the M16. It was not, nay, it was never, intended as a "sporting" rifle. It was intended as a killing machine.
614 2018-03-25 18:47:33 Bump stocks are not the problem all schools should have metal detectors, doors locked after last student.  There should be a buzzer for late  arrivals,others,that have to go through a metal detector before they are admitted. Bump stocks guns knives don't go off by themselves
615 2018-03-25 18:47:31 Why is he invested in gun stocks?
616 2018-03-25 18:47:02 Only the uneducated will believe this lie that you & NRA are trying to spread. Obama Admin didn't "legalize" bump stocks, they simply did not ban them. You are a coward to lie your way out of this and fear and bow to the NRA as you do. We need strong leader in power, not weak.
617 2018-03-25 18:46:29 They’re gaining momentum, putting more pressure, instilling hope for change, even getting the White House to offer executive orders on bump stocks. 

One step in a journey of many miles (or kilometers)
618 2018-03-25 18:46:10 sure you can, if that guy couldn't buy bump stocks or stock pile the massive amount of ammo he had, many fewer would have died
619 2018-03-25 18:45:40 Stocks
620 2018-03-25 18:45:37 Bump stocks are supposedly on their way out (hopefully includes all modifiers) Students asking for assault weapons ban, ban of high cap. magazines, and universal background checks. Common sense. Not repeal of 2nd Amendment.  Read Supreme Court rulings on 1st and 2nd Amendments.
621 2018-03-25 18:44:58 yes but they got the cough, republican traitor's to start taking our 2A rights, 1 take away at a time. bump stocks did nothing in these killings. They want all weapons removed, that has capacity, to hold over 10 rounds mags. Yes, they want mags taken away too.
622 2018-03-25 18:44:00 (3) Friday the DOJ banned bump stocks which turns legal weapons into illegal machine guns
623 2018-03-25 18:43:50 Bump stocks have been used in exactly 1 shooting of which I am aware.

The most common weapons in mass shootings are handguns. In the worst 32 shootings in US history, only 9 used an AR. Only 14 used anything that has been included in an assault weapon ban.

Facts matter.
624 2018-03-25 18:43:43 Can we add a few things?
- remove guns from the mentally unstable and /or those judge to be a danger to themselves or others.
- get rid of anything that makes a non-automatic weapons act like an automatic weapon, I.e. Bump stocks
625 2018-03-25 18:43:16 They are not against guns.They are aggainst assault rifles,bump stocks,silencers and armor piercing bullets never should have been legal

629 2018-03-25 18:41:15 "Rick Santorum" those students made controversial statements about gun control. What was that about now they have the bump stocks they will take it all? What the hell does that mean? But hey folks, no one wants ur guns. What a joke.

631 2018-03-25 18:39:54 The Token Two. Lol!
You two are an embarrassment to black people. Maybe they’ll invite you to the next GOP convention so you can entertain them while they get all of their photo ops in with a “real life black person”. You’re only black on the OUTSIDE though. Laughing stocks.
632 2018-03-25 18:39:53 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
633 2018-03-25 18:39:40 AG Sessions just banned bump stocks. Good. That, along with the measures in the STOP School Violence Act, are positive actions.
634 2018-03-25 18:39:36 He’s right that the ATF concluded they couldn’t ban bump stocks under existing laws. That doesn’t mean we have to accept bump stocks. It means that newer, clearer laws need to be enacted.

I hope that will happen starting in January of 2019.
635 2018-03-25 18:39:34 Considering that the media likes to talk about things like bump stocks and the AR in AR15 standing for Assualt Rifle without knowing what they are talking about, I’d say specifics are pretty vaild and necessary.
636 2018-03-25 18:39:34 Actually some do. We have BGC already. What is the definition of an assault weapon? FYI AR15s are not assault weapons. They are the most common and least powerful rifle sold in the US. Bump stocks don't turn semi into full auto, still 1 bullet per 1 trigger pull. #TheMoreYouKnow
637 2018-03-25 18:39:28 The omnibus bill had Fix-NICS attached and he has instructed Jeff Sessions to ban bump stocks. He has done more to hurt the second amendment than Obama...
638 2018-03-25 18:39:27 R U GETTIN FOLKS, they don't intend on stopping at this or that, or bump stocks or background chcks, they want to ban all guns, THEIR WORDING NOT MINE, SEMI AUTOMATIC WEAPONS, folks that is keyword for handguns
639 2018-03-25 18:38:44 Do y’all have good money saving apps? Like for stocks or something. I use Acorns but I don’t really like it.
640 2018-03-25 18:38:27 What would a fool like Santorum know about CPR? He couldn't even save his seat in congress. Taking advice from him is like asking a garden slug which stocks to buy to make a lot of money. Forget You FORMER senator.
641 2018-03-25 18:38:07 Look.  You need to be on the side of humanity.
Mass shooters PREFER AR-15s and bump stocks.
642 2018-03-25 18:37:35 Sure it has, Cod stocks are in danger in the Maritimes.
643 2018-03-25 18:37:17 Rifles have obvious advantage over pistols in their range, their accuracy and their ammo.  This is one of the reasons why they are used in combat over pistols.  You gun lovers also like the cherry pick the massacres, but many have used HC clips and bump stocks.
644 2018-03-25 18:36:58 and you're a freaking liar. Obama didnt legalize bump stocks.
645 2018-03-25 18:36:45 weakness has also been due to spot weakness, but last couple of weeks we saw a lot of selling on many names. Will stocks keep getting hit weekly until July? If anyone can find new weights and post here, we can calc expected impact. I'll be calling solactive this week
646 2018-03-25 18:36:36 @KyleKashuv @davidhogg111 @cameron_kasky So wondering if you kids will thank President Trump for banning bump stocks, because you know Obama (a Democrat) legalized them&will you thank @POTUS for doing more on gun control than Obama did when he had control of senate/congress?
647 2018-03-25 18:36:33 @jimcramer Big fan of yours. thank you for your service to individual investors i think investors need to calm down and don’t sell because selling will only lead to more selling and we can’t get the timing right. the second we sell stocks go up
648 2018-03-25 18:36:03 Absolutely. He said that he is a hunter and a few weeks ago he said bump stocks could be added to every rifle manufactured. He knows even less about rifles than he does about politics. Try and put a bump stock on a bolt action rifle. What an idiot
649 2018-03-25 18:35:41 Lors d'un séjour en France n'hésitez pas a nous contacter pour vérifiez la disponibilité, les stocks chez l'éditeur ne sont malheureusement pas important.
650 2018-03-25 18:35:29 Y'all are so strong.  I will always support sensible gun reform. I am but 1 voice for eliminating bump stocks, high cap mags, assault-style weapons (which should NOT be for sale to the public). I'm for 30-days minimum & deep background checks. 
One Vet For Gun Reform.
651 2018-03-25 18:35:22 Legislatures won't even do the minimum on guns... bump stocks/better data based on who can own a gun/ waiting periods...at minimum so many people came out for change perhaps serious discussions can begin
652 2018-03-25 18:34:46 the issue is short term there may be a lot of pressure. LT, nothing changes. URA smaller than gdxj but liquidity in U stocks is also much smaller, so there may be a big impact. Nxe fcu dml have seen about 50/60k selling per day on average. 4 months left,  will selling increase?
653 2018-03-25 18:33:40 These Akmals are laughing stocks of this country. #HBLPSL
654 2018-03-25 18:33:34 In general, yes I am.  I think we should do more to prosecute straw buyers. I wouldn't be opposed to a ban on bump stocks.  

But by and large, yes, I honestly do think current regulations are adequate.
655 2018-03-25 18:32:47 So I guess only criminals will have bump stocks
656 2018-03-25 18:32:36 The three 94’s unfortunately are only available at the distillery but plenty others for you to choose if the store stocks 7 expressions!
657 2018-03-25 18:32:33 'Assault rifke' goes back to the James Brady shoiting. The term meant to ban guns that had certain accessories, like folding stocks (scary huh?). The effect of the Brady Bill was virtually nil, since thise guns are not the weapon of choice for most shootings...
658 2018-03-25 18:32:29 Only because people think you might be lying again could you tell us which law Obama signed legalizing bump stocks
659 2018-03-25 18:31:51 Opps: bump stocks

Still waiting

661 2018-03-25 18:30:45 I see some are Marching FOR guns today. I proudly marched with #MarchForOurLives yesterday.  My response to those marching 2day. Is I did not march to take away any RIGHT to bear arms or to own guns.  I marched for stricter laws and a ban on assault weapons and bump stocks.
662 2018-03-25 18:30:13 @realDonaldTrump It will take a MIRACLE for the 2nd Amendment to be repealed, surviving both houses, you, and the Supreme Court.  Students argue for ban on assault rifles, bump stocks.    I do not see any change in our ability to own and use whatever gun/rifle we choose to have

664 2018-03-25 18:29:34 They still made more in his first year in stock market investments (401ks, stocks) than 8 yrs of Obama-economics.

Oh, wait. It was George Bush's fault.
665 2018-03-25 18:29:06 A volatility box it is for sure. IMO this is very healthy for the bull market in stocks. We started a parabolic move last year that would have ended the bull market this year had it continued for 6 more months. Instead, we may get a healthy correction down to the weekly BB or so.
666 2018-03-25 18:28:32 Yes, in this massacre high capacity mags or bump stocks werent used, unlike in many of the other massacres.  So the question is what is the benefit in using an AR15 over a pistol?
667 2018-03-25 18:27:27 ATF technically did legalize bump stocks during Obama's presidency but it was due to legal hurdles at the time.
668 2018-03-25 18:26:08 You know @JoeBiden rejected the @NRA proposal to fix NISC and that YOU made bump stocks legal. YOU did NOTHING but divide the country and make us less safe. Shut up
669 2018-03-25 18:25:50 Why Trump are you giving into the leftist agenda. I still love you but you need to do some more research on this kind of stuff. Bump Stocks and not really good and you can make a bump stock at home with some common house hold appliances if you really wonted to.
670 2018-03-25 18:25:47 Columbine happened during the last assault weapons ban. People can make magazines & bump-stocks at home. Criminals with records do not buy their firearms legally. It is water under the bridge in a place with over 300 millions of firearms in circulation. Real security saves lives.
671 2018-03-25 18:24:47 finna catch these hands smh
672 2018-03-25 18:24:44 Nope. Enforce and strengthen. 
1. Universal Background checks
2. A federal database
3. Reinstate the 94 ban
4. No high capacity magazines or bump stocks
5. No sales to anyone under 21
6. No special ammunition (armor piercing, tracer, etc)
673 2018-03-25 18:24:07 Check your facts. In 2018, 52% of Americans own stocks, a decline from 66% before the financial crisis. Google it, multiple sources available. However, of that 52%, 10% represent the highest earners in the USA, according to the Federal Reserve. Next.

676 2018-03-25 18:23:03 Saw a guy (an Italian-American) say yesterday that if the First Nations had AR15s with bump stocks, America would never have been colonised… while not spotting the consequences for his own peoples.
677 2018-03-25 18:23:02 When 2nd ammendment was written there weren't AR15s...or bump stocks...should be end of discussion
678 2018-03-25 18:22:49 Could you detail the dangers of pistol grips and folding stocks for me, @MarkWarner ? I mean, since you say Assault Weapons are so dangerous
679 2018-03-25 18:22:48 The @NRA is completely unreasonable I believe in the 2A I believe in restrictions on SOME guns & high capacity mags. Bump stocks should b banned. No 18yr old needs a AR15 or other military style guns with a 100 round mag. Mandatory training for anyone owning a military style gun.
680 2018-03-25 18:22:30 Im all for regulation, within reason, tougher background checks, getting rid of bump stocks, etc. But outright banning them not only is unconstitutional but does not work in our country.
681 2018-03-25 18:21:20 We want COMMON SENSE! •Universal background checks •48-hour waiting period. •21-year old minimum age •Ban of all assault-style rifles and attachments that make firearms more deadly, like bump stocks & high capacity magazines. That’s NOT too much to ask!
682 2018-03-25 18:20:52 1)WHAT is are assault weapons?
2)What is a "high-capacity" magazine? 
3)If bump stocks are banned will you also call for ones finger to be banned bc action can be done w/out any device.I did it by accident off my shoulder!
4)Already have background checks on ALL gun sales cont
683 2018-03-25 18:20:29 Overall I would say I wouldve lost more games then I wouldve won if I just left it to desperation 9's. G&W is a glass cannon that struggles to kill past a certain % but that also leads to him being able to end stocks in 30 seconds because of his insane damage output early on
684 2018-03-25 18:18:09 Fake news

686 2018-03-25 18:17:02 More talking safety training and ensuring proper safe storage.

But in either case, 2/3 parts I made you agreed with, and that's what they are aiming for. Better more comprehensive background checks, banning bump stocks and the like. The only part you differ on is AR bans.
687 2018-03-25 18:16:50 This will not prevent or stop mass shootings. It won't prevent or cure mental illness. It won't prevent killers from obtaining bump stocks and weapons illegally like in the Vegas shooting. So what the hell is the point? To bring free attention to companies. Thats the point. Sad.
688 2018-03-25 18:16:42 Universal background checks. Bump stocks.
689 2018-03-25 18:16:05 Hey @OwenBenjamin how do feel about banning bump stocks?
690 2018-03-25 18:16:00 Looking at Indian/world economy and valuations at which certain stocks are, after beautiful correction.. Certain large to mid cap stocks in Private banking, Nbfc, Pharma, & Midcap/Smallcap IT can double in nxt 1.5 to 2 yrs.. Gud time to buy and truck load gud scripts..
691 2018-03-25 18:15:35 So how would the #Repubtard #2A abuser respond to the kids request?  Respond to each.
Ban on Assault Rifles?
Ban on large capacity mags
Ban on gun stocks?
692 2018-03-25 18:14:35 Automatics have been illegal since the 30's. All pistols are semi automatic except revolvers. M 16s are military weapons and they are automatics. We dont need bump stocks that mimic automatics. Some deer rifles are semi's.
693 2018-03-25 18:13:11 At least Toomey isn’t pretending he’s going to do something. Remember it was the Dems who did nothing for 8 years except legalize bump stocks. Great Casey showed up but meaningless if his walk doesn’t match his talk. Toomey is transparent in his douche-bag policies.
694 2018-03-25 18:12:25 Sorry he sold our data? Sorry he got caught? Sorry he dumped a bunch of his own companies’ stocks, when realizing he was caught? Sorry for knowingly allowing his company to be used to interfere in democratic elections? Zuck has been deceiving Facebook users for years! Jail him!
695 2018-03-25 18:12:17 Actions have consequences
696 2018-03-25 18:12:13 No, there is a gun show loophole and other similar loopholes. Some states have no waiting period. Most states don’t prosecute parents etc who fail to lock guns up and kids shoot siblings.  Limit size of magazines, make bump stocks illegal. MANY common sense steps we can take.
697 2018-03-25 18:11:44 Nah. We are watching you attack each other over the omnibus and bump stocks. We are chopping down pop corn. And waiting for November. #magadabadoo 
698 2018-03-25 18:10:07 Trump has said he will outlaw bump stocks. At least that is one step in the right direction. I dislike the vast majority of Trump's decisions, but very occasionally he does something I agree with. We still need more.
699 2018-03-25 18:09:46 I hope you guys are right! Well, I actually KNOW you’re right in the long term an d that’s why I’m HEAVILY invested in uranium related stocks etc. Mind you, GDXJ restructuring, even if unrelated to #URA has taught me a lesson.
700 2018-03-25 18:09:44 Bump stocks were legalized by the Obama Administration.  Background checks ARE in place. You would know that if you ever tried to purchase a weapon.  Obama admin REMOVED criminal profiles from the database. Wonder why??? Who's committing mass shootings? Wake-Up!
701 2018-03-25 18:09:31 Since Obama made bump stocks legal, doesn't he have blood on his hands?

704 2018-03-25 18:08:08 I wouldn't just name these cretins. I would have them thrown in the stocks and given a wedgie.
705 2018-03-25 18:07:29 Obama supported BUMP STOCKS for AR-15's!!!
706 2018-03-25 18:06:28 Policies necessary for gun reform:
-ban bump stocks
-implement trained armed security guards or armed police officers to secure and protect American schools 24/7 
-implement metal detectors in every American school entrance
-forbid actual mentally ill people  from buying guns.
707 2018-03-25 18:06:22 See this is the kind of political chaos and upheaval that comes before society starts bringing back stuff like putting people in the stocks.
708 2018-03-25 18:05:54 The only gun ban people at the marches are asking for is assault weapons, bump stocks and large capacity magazines, and I think you will see some bans in those areas.  Trump has already told DOJ to issue a ruling banning bump stocks.
709 2018-03-25 18:05:30 Should anyone tell her who made bump stocks legal?
710 2018-03-25 18:05:01 I appreciate the discussion. I do...but you’d be surprised about how they (Mella/Sven) trade; it’s just not out for the twittersphere to take in. Yes, money can be made despite being bearish in an upward trending market in various asset classes/stocks
711 2018-03-25 18:04:36 Buffett’s three groups in 1970’s:

1. Generals - undervalued stocks (NWY) (YTRA) (BBRG)
2. Workouts - catalyst driven/turnaround (STKS) (ARRS) (LQDT) (SAUC)
3. Control situations - activism (NWL) (DAVE) (PICO)

Still a good framework for a portfolio IMO
712 2018-03-25 18:02:32 took you a few stocks to warm him up but you were lookin mad good towards the end of g5
713 2018-03-25 18:02:23 It was never about the bump stocks.  It was about how much of our rights they could strip away before we caught on.  I don't use or need a bumpstock but I would never accept it being banned.  It's the principle of the matter.  Not one step back!
714 2018-03-25 18:02:07 Any modifications to make a fire arm fully automatic is illegal bump stocks do not make firearms automatic just simulated

716 2018-03-25 18:01:13 It really depends on how the stocks are being used imo if you stock mash a header it doesn’t show much skill but on the other hand, if you use the stocks to enhance the header I think it shows a certain skill level. Just my opinion though
717 2018-03-25 18:01:13 Ive taken stocks with a single grab aswell so I dont see how giving yourself a 1/9 chance of getting a stock vs not using the best aspect of your character makes sense
718 2018-03-25 18:01:03 FYI bump stocks are still available. They aren't banned yet he has yet to pass any laws regarding at this time. The NRA said no you can't do that and he had taken their advise very seriously.
719 2018-03-25 18:00:09 Bump stocks I can agree with, they’re unnecessary. But the ar-15 on its own I don’t see a problem with
720 2018-03-25 18:00:02 The market does not know if you are long or short and could not care less. #forex #stocks
721 2018-03-25 17:59:35 Moreso banning high capacity magazines. Also bump stocks, which thank god trump finally did something right for a change. Also mandatory background checks and waiting periods. But muh AR15
722 2018-03-25 17:59:25 We can start with limiting ammunition sales to individuals (like sudafed), banning high capymagazines and bump stocks, restricting ar-15 sales to 21+, and closing the god damn gun show loop holes.
723 2018-03-25 17:59:15 Fuck, I didn't read the full thing :(... I thought it said "Do you use stocks on your work."
724 2018-03-25 17:58:52 It may be all about the rising Libor and the TED spread.  Liquidity is drying up. If that continues, all stocks fall, including financials
725 2018-03-25 17:58:42 Looks like the @NRA realizes that public sentiment is against them.  The NRA needs to stop doing the bidding of gun companies, and start paying taxes.  Represent lawful gun owners who don't want assault weapons.  Ban bump stocks.  2 week waiting periods.
726 2018-03-25 17:58:14 depends if you just used stocks on the design
727 2018-03-25 17:58:02 Ki just made a strong argument and convinced me to invest in 2 new stocks
728 2018-03-25 17:57:58 Keep an eye on the 200 ma... and even a bit lower... there will be my entry point in stocks... like Netflix @$10-50
729 2018-03-25 17:57:36 Doesn'T the legislative branch make laws? There was no law against bump stocks just as there isn't now. We are not stupid stupid.
730 2018-03-25 17:57:28 Mine never stocks it...wish it did!
731 2018-03-25 17:56:09 Neither the AR-15 or the damn bump stocks used to modify them should be legal to purchase in this country by civilians. That clear enough for ya'??
732 2018-03-25 17:56:02 There're several put/call ratios: CPC, CPCE, CPCI. The CPC is total activity (all issues), while the CPCE only tracks individual stocks. Hence, when overlaying put/call ratios with stock markets it's more prudent to use the CPCE (or CPCI). The CPC is least favorite IMHO.
733 2018-03-25 17:55:25 Stocks (Equities) down, Bond Yields down, Bond (Treasury) Prices up (Latter two variables are inverse), Soybeans down , Boeing stock down  (Possible US China Tarriff impact) My.02
734 2018-03-25 17:55:21 He already said he would be open to banning bump stocks and moving the age to 21 years old to legally buy a fire arm.  What do you think either you personally or the people that were protesting want gun control to consist of? What reforms do you think would make a difference?
735 2018-03-25 17:55:11 By banning bump stocks, you recognize high rate of fire weapons are a problem (I.e. guns are a problem). Then why not ban AR-15s and the like? Be consistent. Your half measure isn’t compromise, it’s intellectual bankruptcy.
736 2018-03-25 17:54:58 Idk about Illinois. I live in Florida. I'm fine with bump stocks being off the table but not automatic weapons. I work in AL and the sheriff in the county where I workwants some kind of restrictive laws...but I think that is just not theright avenue.
737 2018-03-25 17:54:42 I saw this coming weeks ago. Stupidity is predictable. His tariffs are going to kill jobs next. He has been riding Obama’s coattails for too long. Sooner or later his idiot decisions are going to have negative affects. If you’re playing the stock market, look at marijuana stocks.
738 2018-03-25 17:54:35 My views on gun control are keeping the 2nd amendment & helping people get the facts- for example - Obama made bump stocks legal & did nothing about gun control when he had the chance- people kill people not guns- it's been going on since the beginning- murder is murder whether-
739 2018-03-25 17:54:26 Why would you ban bump stocks?  They actually make guns less effective and have been used in virtually no shootings.  It's silly to ban something that won't make a difference.
740 2018-03-25 17:54:22 Even after a rocky few months & worst start to a year ever in 2016, investors have been rewarded for owning stocks if they stayed the course.

3yrs thru 3/23
DFA US Core 2 Equity = +26.2%
DFA Int’l Core Equity = +20.2%
DFA EM Core Equity = +27.3%
DFA Five-Year Global Bond = +3.4%
741 2018-03-25 17:54:17 You'll get a ticket if you text while driving in almost all US states, yet it's perfectly okay and legal to buy an assault rifle, let alone bump stocks and high-capacity magazines and military weapons as a whole. These two things are not comparable at all. #GunReformNow
742 2018-03-25 17:53:10 "Liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate farmers, liquidate real estate... it will purge the rottenness out of the system." - Andrew Mellon. Sounds like on other planet today. #economy #stockmarkets
743 2018-03-25 17:52:32 Automatic weapons have been outlawed (unable to license) since 1986. I can agree with you on "bump stocks" or any other device that causes a weapon to become automatic.
744 2018-03-25 17:52:12 Taking back control to overfish the stocks as happened to the Dogger Bank?  And as EU is biggest market, who is going to buy fish if out off EU? It's not all too easy as Brexiteers are saying.
745 2018-03-25 17:50:28 Military grade assault rifles, bump stocks, certain ammunition. If people find fun in shooting military style rifles, make gun ranges available where weapons are provided there & not taken home. Why'd Las Vegas shooter need all those weapons & accessories?
746 2018-03-25 17:49:57 What stocks are on everybody's watch list for this upcoming week
747 2018-03-25 17:49:54 Lots of talk of btc triangles and vol. Sell off in stocks last week, likely to continue. Some of that capital may flow to crypto - some of mine has. A scenario - we retrace a bit, and as stock sell trades settle over next week, we pump it? Be ready for anything - stay frosty.
748 2018-03-25 17:49:30 STOCKS and BONDS:  If you are worried about your 401K, you can move your holdings from stocks to cash to a level where you won't worry about it.  Making a little on cash is better than losing a lot on stocks. Risky markets.  Expect volatility,    @TheDemocrats @TheDemCoalition
749 2018-03-25 17:49:18 That’s why Congress needs to pass a law banning bump stocks to show they care more about public safety than the NRA.
750 2018-03-25 17:46:44 First off ,  educate yourself, automatic weapons are ALREADY illegal, semi automatic is not, and never will be. Bump stocks are inefficient and useless . Nobody I know wants one. So go ahead with that feel good legislation that means absolutely nothing
751 2018-03-25 17:46:18 Interviewing Porno  you’ve fallen so far down the national inquirer sewer hole
752 2018-03-25 17:46:06 First time we have a president on the side of right, he cant back away. He knows something has to happen. All the past talked a bit. Then, bowed to pressure! Obama, authorized bump stocks for example. Turn a semi-auto into a machine gun! WTF. So yeah, it's gunna happen. Hang in!
753 2018-03-25 17:45:56 . @POTUS banned bump stocks Friday Dear. Try to catch up. Now shoo fly. No bullies, bots, or trolls are allowed here.
754 2018-03-25 17:45:54 yeah, it is not a lie. The girl who gave a speach said,"they will give us an inch, bump stocks, we will take a mile" clearly the goal is a total gun ban which violates the 2nd Amendment. Already freedom of speech is attacked when people use proper gender term
755 2018-03-25 17:45:49  and this is why conversation stops with BOTH sides. Automatic weapons are already banned. An AR-15 is NOT an automatic weapon. Bump stocks are only 1 (of MANY) ways to make a SEMI-automatic weapon fire much faster.
756 2018-03-25 17:45:49 The overall value of the market did drop because people sold their stocks in fear of a trade war
757 2018-03-25 17:45:45 Frenzied people busy typing #DeleteFacebook on top Facebook

#fintelcoach
758 2018-03-25 17:43:45 You expect Trump to attend a Leftist funded march for an agenda that his opposition party is pushing? His Base doesn’t want gun control! Trump knows that. It’s not enough for you people, that he’s willing to add stricter background checks, ban bump stocks, add school guards etc.
759 2018-03-25 17:43:41 Small steps.  There is no need for carte blanche access to suped up weapons.  Hunting, I get.  Protection, I get.  However, IMO people need to be trained to use these weapons.  Unless you are military, there's NO reason for a person to have bump stocks or AR-15s.
760 2018-03-25 17:43:37 AR 15 with 30 round magazine is not common ground. Ban bump stocks and 30 round magazines and let them have all the AR 15's with a 5 shot magazine ,does  2nd amendment say anything about magazines.
761 2018-03-25 17:43:35 Not unreasonable, per Mitch Landrieu of New Orleans, 2 have:

* Universal background checks
* Laws against weapons of war & bump stocks
* Waiting periods
* Reasonable gun restrictions
* Responsible gun ownership
762 2018-03-25 17:43:02 Is that a threat, tough guy? Obama made bump stocks legal, Trump is making them illegal.
763 2018-03-25 17:42:20 Bump stocks fire like a machine gun. And get a high capacity 100 round mag and a bump stock and you got a machine gun that can do a lot of killing.  Why are you Right wingers such dumb fvcks?
764 2018-03-25 17:42:16 Owning a gun may be fine but not automoatic, semi-automatic, assault weapons, bump stocks or multiple weapons. Gun ownership today has gone well beyond the right to bear arms. There are too many copy cat Rambo's
765 2018-03-25 17:42:09 They're semi-automatic assault rifles. 1 shot per trigger pull. They're light, absorb recoil, shoot a high velocity round, can be enhanced with bump stocks and folding stocks to make them concealable. The damage can be devastating, it's why they're so popular in mass shootings.
766 2018-03-25 17:41:28 @MartinSLewis Hi, have you heard of Moneybox, which takes your change (rounded up ie spend £1,60, get 40p ‘Change’ and invests change in stocks & shares?
767 2018-03-25 17:41:22 Sorry got tied up, wanted to continue this though. 

Do you support the limitation or banning of bump stocks and other such devices that modify legal weapons into illegal capabilities? (Currently is illegal to have full auto fire)

769 2018-03-25 17:40:49 @marcorubio There is no threat to the 2nd Ammendment banning assault weapons or the bomp stocks. Even the military agrees with us. The only threat is your job. Save up now and collect all you can from the NRA...you will need it.
770 2018-03-25 17:40:29 ...that does not mean we repeal all laws and that constitutional rights are limitless.  You cannot accuse me of being in favor of totalitarianism for proposing an idea like a federal ban on bump stocks. You cannot say that I am not willing to be reasonable in this debate.
771 2018-03-25 17:40:19 Agreed.  There is so much misinformation  (lies) about guns, that ignorance rules the left, and feeds the hysteria of their narrative. However, as a second ammendment supporter, I think bump stocks are a cheap after market cheat.
772 2018-03-25 17:40:15 Muh bump stocks.
773 2018-03-25 17:39:46 Las Vegas: u said something about bump stocks, no action. Parkland: You said ban bump stocks and a bunch of other things you never meant, no ...oh, wait...there was action. You met with the NRA. Never mentioned the 'other' things again. But bump stocks made it to Congress anyway.
774 2018-03-25 17:39:29 Why aren’t we talking about the company that makes bump stocks? You know, the mod that makes a semi automatic completely auto? Bueller?
775 2018-03-25 17:38:58 No one is stripping away your right to own firearms, no one!  Raising the age to 21 to own any gun, extensive background checks, banning bump stocks...none of these things are taking away guns. If you are law abiding, why wouldn't you support gun reform? It won't affect you
776 2018-03-25 17:38:18 1. I’m fine w. banning bump stocks. I think they’re stupid, but it’s not going to change anything. Google “bump fire w. belt loop.”

2. I think we need to make up our minds about what an adult is & stick to it. 18 is old enough to vote, enlist, & be tried as an adult in court...
777 2018-03-25 17:37:34 he said, all his predictions have never been wrong. Don't forget to buy VRL Logistics and Finance stocks tomorrow.
778 2018-03-25 17:37:22 "can be easily be modified with things like bump stocks to become one"  Any gun can be modified to become an automatic weapon.  But, it's against the the law to do so already.
779 2018-03-25 17:37:18 No one wants to take anybody’s guns away,we’re fighting for a ban on military style rifles,stronger background checks,21 years old before purchase,bump stocks ban and that way everyone who owns a gun can be proud and our country as a whole becomes safer.Common sense goals for all
780 2018-03-25 17:37:09 The kids have spoken. Bump stocks won't be the end of this debate. Say goodbye to anyone who takes money from the NRA. That $30 million dollars from them to your campaign will resonate w/ voters. You chose to ignore them to play golf on Saturday but they're coming for all of you.
781 2018-03-25 17:36:59 ‘(1) they don’t sell firearms to someone who hasn’t passed a background check, (2) they restrict the sale of firearms for individuals under 21 years of age, and (3) they don’t sell bump stocks or high-capacity magazines.’  Why so angry?  Not asking for you to give up your guns.
782 2018-03-25 17:36:28 Also, most of these protesters aren't against normal handguns for self-defense, or even hunting rifles, they're protesting how easy it is to get a gun in this country. 97% of the Country supports a Universal background check, while 82% support a ban on bump stocks.
783 2018-03-25 17:36:26 Yeah stock market will dive for a while but it won't be a disaster for 90% of population in USA WHO DON'T OWN STOCKS.
TOUGH Chew HARDER.
784 2018-03-25 17:36:06 Without them seeing me, I brushed against men and women standing in patches of stocks
785 2018-03-25 17:36:00 How many people in  own AR-15s or other military grade assault rifles? I would submit that very few if any do. Does anyone own bump stocks? Common sense reform people.
786 2018-03-25 17:35:28 You're technically incorrect (again) in your statement, Sir. And banning bump stocks is only a small part of the issue. VERY small part. Background checks, age limits, no more weapons of war on the streets. Get a backbone with the NRA, Sir.  Is their $ worth more than kids lives?
787 2018-03-25 17:35:16 Okay sunshine. Let’s try this one more time. Don’t want all of your guns. Just automatic ones, bump stocks, you know, the mass killing ones.
788 2018-03-25 17:34:23 #NeverAgain  If you look at the second Militia Act of 1792 it's pretty clear which weapons they had in mind when they gave the people, the right to bear arms. Muskets and flintlocks - no mention of AR-15's or bump stocks. Maybe a good idea to create a Militia Act of 2018?
789 2018-03-25 17:33:59 I’m really tired of feeling like the little lifestyle I’m able to afford now can be snatched away from my so I’ve really been investing in these stocks while the market is trash
790 2018-03-25 17:33:56 NO ONE IS SAYING THAT YOU MYOPIC FOOLS.  Bump stocks, background checks, age 21, 1000’s of rounds of ammo, military weapons...that’s what people are takin about.
791 2018-03-25 17:33:42 I'm not even anti-2nd amendment, I own 2 guns myself; I just think that semiautomatic rifles/bump stocks/high capacity magazines should be heavily restricted as their only practical use is killing people in large volumes...
792 2018-03-25 17:33:33 Yes common sense. Remember when Barack Hussein Obama signed right on to gun bump stocks in 2012 ? Sure did. All about common sense changes myself.
793 2018-03-25 17:32:46 can u jst pls stop pota mah mind stocks negative thoughts rn
794 2018-03-25 17:32:39 If Gartman sells sell.  I’m loading up.  Commodities yes but he’s awful at stocks.   #stoppedClock
795 2018-03-25 17:31:32 There is a HUGE different between "you must do this with a legal weapon that you have already purchased" and "you cannot own high cap mags, bump stocks, all gun sales must have background checks, whether private or through dealer, etc etc."
796 2018-03-25 17:31:17 The DOJ (correctly IMO) changes the rules to ban "bump stocks".

The #marchforlife crowd immediately declares it "not enough".

And that my friends is why we'll never get anywhere w/ preventing school violence.

No compromise is ever going to be enough for the gun-grabbers.  #2A
797 2018-03-25 17:31:13 Gun regulations won’t impede your second amendment rights.  Universal background checks, banning bump stocks,  raising the age for firearms such as the Ar-15... all legal and  can be done without impacting your 2nd amendment rights.
798 2018-03-25 17:31:11 The march was about gun violence as a WHOLE. Not just banning guns. Make them harder for people to get. That’s all. Raise the age limit, ban the bump stocks, ban high capacity mags, ban military style weapons from civilian use. It’s not infringing on the #2A. Just restricts it.
799 2018-03-25 17:30:41 As long as your all in fantasy land.. Ninjas.. Get a Ninja at every school.. He will take out any bad guy with any weapon.
Would some new gun laws really be that bad? Banning bump stocks..Nat background check
How about a gun licence like a drivers license..with gun range  eval
800 2018-03-25 17:30:25 Now don't misunderstand me. I'm actually in the camp of sensible gun laws. Better screening and an elimination of bump stocks. But all these people screaming about a ban are NOT thinking long term and are only hearing what they want to hear.
801 2018-03-25 17:30:02 I don't think about financial success as the measurement of my success. #tradeforex #stocks
802 2018-03-25 17:29:39 Know the law, Mr. President.  Bump stocks do not turn semi-autos into automatic weapons, and machine guns are not illegal.  They may be owned with the proper federal license, fee and background check.
803 2018-03-25 17:29:18 You can Google the data on lost sales to the companies yourself, or just look at their stocks at the time the announced.
804 2018-03-25 17:28:56 Sessions has moved to have bump stocks classes as machines guns making them illegal. It will be finalized next week but won’t be officially law for 90 days during which time they can retract it. It’s up to sessions if he carries through.
805 2018-03-25 17:27:05 Seems like Dems want to take away more than bump stocks??
806 2018-03-25 17:26:41 Paranoia has fueled increase in sales and stocks of ammunition and gun companies for years. #NRA  loves it & knows ignorance fuels these sales & ups their memberships. #guncontrolnotgungrabbing
807 2018-03-25 17:26:30 Nobody ever said we wanted to ban guns guns are a constitutional right Banning assault weapons bump stocks and raising the purchase age to 21 is a good start
808 2018-03-25 17:26:19 @stocks_william
809 2018-03-25 17:26:05 And bump stocks and a waiting period
810 2018-03-25 17:26:03 @Phillis73010045 @stocks_william
811 2018-03-25 17:25:04 Dahhh it didn't work because they forgot to officially ban bump stocks - come on - that must be it!
812 2018-03-25 17:24:59 Get rid of Bump stocks and AR 15!  Save our kids.
813 2018-03-25 17:24:49 You sure?
Semi-automatics with "bump stocks" are great if you want to massacre children or congregations in black churches.
Not really much use against the most sophisticated and powerful military the world has ever seen.
814 2018-03-25 17:23:46 You are saying those people stopped mentally ill people from not being able to own guns? There are already checks on this and have been. Speakers at the March literally said bump stocks were the first step to the gun ban.
815 2018-03-25 17:22:21 no bump stocks?  stronger background checks?  oh no!  the liberals are trying to take over as dictators.  the horror!  how am i supposed to shoot up that community center if they take away my bump stocks? (sarcasm)
816 2018-03-25 17:21:50 Banning bump stocks is a good move. Thank you.
817 2018-03-25 17:21:46 To be clear, #DefendTheSecond / #2A gun nuts beleive bump stocks, silencers, high capacity magazines, weak background checks, and unchecked private sales are TOTALLY WORTH the cost if school shootings as collateral damage.

Remember this in Nov.
#BlueWave2018 #MarchForOurLives
818 2018-03-25 17:21:43 Bump stocks!
819 2018-03-25 17:19:35 Surrender Your Bump Stocks #DisappointmentIn4Words #Confiscation #WhatIsNext
820 2018-03-25 17:19:00 Price is what you pay; value is what you get. Whether we're talking about socks or stocks, I like buying quality merchandise when it is marked down. #unichallengerw
821 2018-03-25 17:18:52 You do realize bump stocks approved by Obama.
822 2018-03-25 17:18:06 Follow @keekztradez if you’re interested in day trading stocks!
823 2018-03-25 17:17:36 Tulips and stocks
824 2018-03-25 17:16:47 Sorry but that is not what marchers are aiming for. Measures include banning assault weapons, bump stocks, high capacity magazines, closing loopholes in back ground checks & raising age of purchase to 21 yrs. All of these are suppoeted by law enforcement agencies.
825 2018-03-25 17:16:39 Two days back AG said once the horse is out of the stable it’s difficult to catch go buy the stocks now only by 12 noon all stocks collapsed not only horse back to the stable investors also doomed 
826 2018-03-25 17:16:17 @ViciousVish I feel like there should be a game of monopoly for summit but instead of investing in buildings, you invest in player stocks XD #FullBloom4Hype
827 2018-03-25 17:16:00 He thing that bugs me about our “leaders” is that they cannot get simple things done. Take bump stocks, no one has come out FOR bump stocks & everyone is against them. Why can’t someone craft a simple Bill that outlaws them instead of trying to get consensus on everything
828 2018-03-25 17:15:36 Common sense #GunReform laws are not an attempt to take away guns; stop skewing. Age limits. No bump stocks. Removal of loopholes. Background checks. 
Not selling automatic guns & no sales to convicted felon are already amendments.
829 2018-03-25 17:15:14 This why so many big elite have been selling stocks to have heavy cash reserves to transition. Zuckerberg sold 1/3 of his stock in Facebook over 3 months then has resigned as CEO to avoid prosecution. Seek Asylum in ASIA
830 2018-03-25 17:15:14 In some cases you can identify a “mentally unstable” person but then what? The NRA would explode in anger if police confiscated a legally obtained weapon.  I can’t legally purchase a rocket launcher or a grenade, and I shouldn’t have access to bump stocks/high cap mags.
831 2018-03-25 17:14:49 Wrong move.
Numb stocks are not the problem.
Morals , God and constitution stripped from our schools and homes are the problem.
832 2018-03-25 17:14:31 Its already becoming the amazon of the cannabis industry.  They are the future of cannabkd
833 2018-03-25 17:14:30 Who is that then? Mine is the party who disrespects our legacy in helping refugees and immigrants and stocks racism and hatred of minorities in direct similarity to the past. Who vote against the will of a Jewish refugee to help children survive etc
834 2018-03-25 17:14:11 All for getting rid of bump stocks and extended mags...but you can't have my hunting rifle or the side arm I protect my wife and child with. I took the required classes, passed background checks. I don't even carry mine on me but home invasion is my worry. We need middle ground.
835 2018-03-25 17:13:31 I agree w/u on those points. He shouldn't have had a gun in the 1st place & current gun laws also need to b enforced; but we also need stronger background checks, less NRA $ controlling our Congressppl, banning bump stocks, limiting magazine #s & add't'l measures to 4 protection.
836 2018-03-25 17:13:29 Just shows how mushy those young minds are.  Let them do their thing and protest. If they paid attn they'd know some legislation did pass & DOJ put ban on bump stocks.  Spouting "revolution" won't help their cause & won't they need guns for their revolution?

838 2018-03-25 17:13:02 #NitinBhatia sir pls tell us selection of best penny stocks for long term or source to check it out.
839 2018-03-25 17:12:59 It troubles me that Trump used false flags to implement a ban on bump stocks. That is something I never expected he would do. Was this just a n easy political win for him to capitalize on or is he cooperating with the agenda? I don't know but we should at least question it.
840 2018-03-25 17:12:31 I'm not suggesting any sort of ban on anything other than semiautomatic rifles/bump stocks/high capacity magazines...the stopping power bit was only used to illustrate that a semiautomatic rifle is less practical for hunting than a bolt action rifle
841 2018-03-25 17:12:18 You know why trading is the best job in the world? We can change what stocks and sectors to be in. We can be long or short. Or, we can just call a timeout and sit in cash.  There are unlimited timeouts. Many of us can win. It’s not like sports - 1 winner.
842 2018-03-25 17:11:42 Don’t say he didn’t do anything, he legalized bump stocks
843 2018-03-25 17:11:15 We probably not only need it on accessories based on things like bump stocks but we have to limit the scope of 2A because of technology like 3D printing for example. The founders didn't foresee the evolution of technology.

We can't make 2A holy, we have to account for technology
844 2018-03-25 17:10:54 It feels a lot better to be able to buy stocks at around panic bottoms , will we breach 9200 and another 8% fall@in midcap index ? Not sure , but better to be prepared to buy ( raise funds by selling on rallies , which will come even if it goes lower after that )

846 2018-03-25 17:09:55 Background checks, waiting periods, bans on bump stocks and high capacity magazines are pretty common ground. As in, most gun owners support these policies. Why doesn’t the NRA?
847 2018-03-25 17:09:55 First they limited the magazines, and I did not speak out
Because I can reload pretty fast.

Then they came for the bump stocks, and I did not speak out
Because I did not own a bump stock.
848 2018-03-25 17:09:15 * increase the waiting period for long guns to 72 hours, just like hand guns.
* increase age restriction for assault style guns to 21.
* ban conversion devices like bump stocks and autogloves.
* stop the sale of extended clips of more than eleven rounds. (Make them change clips.)
849 2018-03-25 17:08:43 Have you ever considered that people who hate how slow this game is and people who lose stocks early are completely different people
850 2018-03-25 17:08:15 @SenKamalaHarris   I would like you to know that I am a voter who supports the idea that better gun controls are needed.  I would like to see a ban on bump-stocks, raise the age of assault weapons and better mental health services.  I would NOT support teachers having weapons.
851 2018-03-25 17:08:05 Oooo I thought were living in the now! Did you watch Uw basketball on the @HISTORY channel this year #mubb

853 2018-03-25 17:07:39 But I though Obama was akin to Jesus or something?
Only right wing satanist Nazis would ever legalize something like bump stocks...
854 2018-03-25 17:07:27 Now to make video games, stop, then rant on Twitter about bigots and stocks
855 2018-03-25 17:07:00 Thoughts & prayers don't stop the sale of military weapons to civilians who don't need them. Despite the BRA lies, banning these does not infringe on 2nd Amendments rights. Neither does raising the age or banning bump-stocks. Get the BRA out of the GOP pants.
856 2018-03-25 17:06:59 @RepJuanVargas  I would like you to know that I am a voter who supports the idea that better gun controls are needed.  I would like to see a ban on bump-stocks, raise the age of assault weapons and better mental health services.  I would NOT support teachers having weapons.
857 2018-03-25 17:06:23 You KNOW Santorum increases his portfolio of gun industry stocks after each shooting.
858 2018-03-25 17:05:56 Given your use of such tight stops, tho -- would I be correct in assuming you don't trade thin stocks like $LGIH?
859 2018-03-25 17:05:46 A bump stock is a modification that can make a perfectly normal semi-auto gun a fully-auto gun.
Fully autos are pretty much banned from civilian ownership.
So bump stocks being legal is pretty hypocritical.
But Obama this “perfect” president, is the one who legalized them.
860 2018-03-25 17:05:44 If I am understanding the IL bill, it was multi-faceted & centers around bump stocks & high cap mags sim to used in LV? Also makes it illegal to carry or possess such a weapon? Is my understanding flawed? Isn’t it possible to remove those additions to the weapon making it legal?
861 2018-03-25 17:05:37 He's right, you know. "Phony gun laws" won't solve the problem. Real gun laws might. Let's start with banning weapons that shoot bullets at high velocity, like the AR-15, add bump stocks, go from there.
862 2018-03-25 17:05:31 True Life: I Blew It All On Biopharmaceutical Penny Stocks
863 2018-03-25 17:04:44 Gun CONTROLL is a good thing. I'm from MS .. I believe I have the right to my guns; however, automatic weapons, bump stocks, etc. need to go.  I try to stay up on politics on both sides .. and I sir, have heard no politician say, "Take all their guns!."
864 2018-03-25 17:04:41  Trump signed order banning Bump stocks ....
 Florida raised age to 21
865 2018-03-25 17:03:51 Well they should also learn CPR. And the armed guard in Maryland stopped a mass shooting. But I think Trump would sign serious gun control. He's already outlawed bump stocks & pushed for more background checksOf course officials have to do their duty and report students like Cruz
866 2018-03-25 17:03:31 "many institutions prefer to buy on pullbacks and during market corrections. Selloffs provide liquidity that masks their accumulation. Once the pressure from the general market is removed, those stocks tend to outperform" @ivanhoff2 Watch March 27th or early April.

868 2018-03-25 17:02:59 Meanwhile, people are comparing taking away semiautomatic rifles and bump stocks to taking away the second amendment completely. 

???????
869 2018-03-25 17:02:13 No one is saying to take your guns away only to stop selling the Ar-15’s, and bump stocks, large magazines, and make the law 21 for purchasing a gun, Sensible legislation, remember when the 2nd amendment was passed we had NONE of these powerful weapons like we do now...
870 2018-03-25 17:01:23 You’re a lot closer to me now actually. Trading’s been challenging these days since I can’t day trade or buy & sell stocks in less than 30 days I feel the stock trading life force draining out of me...Let me know when you’re in Vegas or The Grand Canyon. Maybe I’ll see u then..
871 2018-03-25 17:01:14 Das Verbot von "Bump Stocks"  ist Schwachsinn und dient nur der NRA "Wir haben was getan" Fakt ist mit lockerer Schulter und Finger am Abzug wird jede halbautomatik zur vollautomatik auch OHNE bump Stock

878 2018-03-25 16:57:53 People complain the game is too slow, yet they lose stocks too early. People don’t find watching a good character do cool things. Hell some people don’t like watching decent characters so cool things. Modern smash culture is so lame :/
879 2018-03-25 16:57:47 Common Sense Gun Reform includes: background checks, exclusion for domestic violence convictions, exclusion for psychiatric hospitalizations, exclusion via red flag laws, exclusion of assault weapons & bump stocks. It does NOT include: banning all guns, or taking them all away.
880 2018-03-25 16:57:23 What is wrong with @TheDemocrats they get caught with their hands in the cookie jar and still think they can lie. But worse. They think they can lecture you on the evils of eating cookies. @EricHolder #FastFurious @HillaryClinton @BillClinton fidelity. @BarackObama bump stocks
881 2018-03-25 16:57:17 If that was so, why are bump stocks controversial ?
882 2018-03-25 16:57:09 @GOP Its time to change gun regulations and listen the the future of America. Raise age to 21, comprehensive background checks, no assault weapons, no bump stocks, no clips over 5 shell capacity, license to own weapons, mandatory safety training, mandatory trigger locks.
883 2018-03-25 16:56:49 That is not the point @NRA.  The point is you are in bed with Russia.   We DON’T like Russia.  We want AR’s gone unless you are fighting in a war. Bump stocks gone. They only belong in war or service.
884 2018-03-25 16:56:43 Trump is willing to sign something serious regarding guns. He's already outlawed bump stocks and increased background checks. Of course those checks were ignored by Broward and the FBI regarding Mr. Cruz.
885 2018-03-25 16:56:22 Each time a gun is found that violates this limit. This is working backwards from nukes being banned toward limiting what guns you can buy. 

I am a gun owner. I don't want all guns banned. But I don't think there is a reason bump stocks exist except to work around laws 2/2
886 2018-03-25 16:55:24 Good brother.  RT @realDonaldTrump: Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal mach guns.
887 2018-03-25 16:55:24 Bump stocks are illegal now. Is it stoping people from using them. No. Because a bag guy don’t care about laws. Your point is moot but can’t be backed up with the facts.
888 2018-03-25 16:54:22 The price will start moving once the big guys have enough money invested  in the sector. As per Rick Rule "don't miss the upcoming PPs later this year".  Currently only retail investors are holding U stocks, URA is the only major player & we all know the result when they buy/sell
889 2018-03-25 16:54:13 Imaginons que je gagne, ce qui est hautement improbable. Est-ce que, une fois sur place dans vos stocks, je pourrais être conseiller pour le PC ? Où est-ce qu'il faudrait que je me renseigne avant ?
890 2018-03-25 16:54:11 Break up the NRA. It is a corrupt organization. Then institute background checks for all purchases w/no exceptions, ban assault weapons, bump stocks, auto & semi-auto (except mil & Police), limit clips to 10 rounds. 2nd A is still in tact. Most of America agrees. DO IT!
891 2018-03-25 16:54:06 This is foolish&part of the problem. I am for more regulation on guns I.e mandatory background checks, ending of bump stocks, regulation of AR’s, @marcorubio is not the one who shot parkland students. @davidhogg111 your message would be more effective if you were more nuanced.
892 2018-03-25 16:53:34 And now bump stocks are about to be too
893 2018-03-25 16:53:01 You are as hate filled as your brother & sister-in-law. Shame on you & them.
Do you & your brother still own all those Russian stocks?
How was your trip to visit the haters across the ocean?

895 2018-03-25 16:52:23 Definitely, bump stocks make it easier to increase the fire rate. I don’t know about accuracy (shooting with bump stocks is woefully inaccurate).

I interpret your last tweet to mean one may favor the ban on bump stocks bc that will make it harder (require more training and skill
896 2018-03-25 16:52:22 Anyone know if Sephora in America stocks Kylie Jenner’s lip kits or any dupes similar?
897 2018-03-25 16:52:14 Just ban assault guns and you wouldn’t have to waste time on bump stocks. I thought you were high IQ.
898 2018-03-25 16:52:09 Not true - people behind the markets love chaos; it makes the market volatility and predictable in a sense. You have to look at the whole market not just Wall Street stocks, but COMEX/commodities futures, everything. And I would know how? Because I was married to it.
899 2018-03-25 16:52:02 As usual little Donny didn't get it right the GOP Congress legalized bump stocks.
900 2018-03-25 16:51:36 Funny how making fun of me isn’t stopping Trump and Sessions from banning bump stocks.
901 2018-03-25 16:51:18 True that bump stocks don't make AR-15S AUTOMATIC EITHER MINE IS FULLY AUTOMATIC AND IT DOESN'T HAVE ONE #ISPEAKTHETRUTH
902 2018-03-25 16:50:50 #HighYields on individual stocks are more likely to signal danger than the same yields on #ETFs and #CEFs, because individual stocks fully expose you to company risk.

909 2018-03-25 16:48:40 Hey @marcorubio we know your owners at the @nra instruct you to say that this is about the 2nd amendment. We also know that you and @nra only care about GUN SALES and use the 2nd to make people angry. BTW, do you own stocks of gun manufacturers? I need to check that

911 2018-03-25 16:48:30 First they came for bump stocks; I didn't say anything because I don't have a bump stock.  Next they came for the rifles . . .  This is how we lose our sacred rights -- one inch at a time.
912 2018-03-25 16:48:22 Sir  telll  me  about  indiabulls real  estate  i have  150  stocks
913 2018-03-25 16:48:15 Hide behind your pseudo 2A Constitutional drivel all you want. Here's the reality: no more bump stocks, no more hi-cap mags, no more "gun show loopholes," and only counting the days until a reimposition of the '94 Federal  Assault Weapons Ban!
914 2018-03-25 16:47:55 Universal background checks prior to gun purchases and a ban on assault-style rifles, for one. No bump stocks. Personally I like the way Japan's gun control works but I can't imagine people who worship guns,  for some bizarre reason, would.
915 2018-03-25 16:47:49 Why, Charlie?  I don't want to take your guns away; I want to take crazy's gun away.  And no automatic firearms, no high capacity magazines, no bump stocks seems like a reasonable compromise between your right to bear arms and some nihilist taking out as many people as possible.

918 2018-03-25 16:46:43 Obama did not use his Constitutional authority to issue an emergency EO to ban the sale of bump stocks, and pressure his Congress to do something about it. He issued an EO for DACA, so why not bump stocks?
919 2018-03-25 16:46:41 the 2nd doesn't protect military weapons on our streets and bump stocks. glad 2 know these children and the ongoing movement will take down liars like u
920 2018-03-25 16:45:18 thanks, i'm not good in math. i just use an on line percentage calculator to put the 2 numbers in then divide it by the number of years. i get 133% return on my high tech holdings since january 2016 when i was lucky to enter many good stocks as the market did a major meltdown.
921 2018-03-25 16:44:55 When their message is “when they give us an inch with bump stocks ban, we’ll take a mile” we won’t give them an inch.
922 2018-03-25 16:44:18 As long as you know it had a good chance to work it’s not hype? This is the reason people keep calling Falcon lame lmao. People just hate seeing stocks lost fsr
923 2018-03-25 16:43:52 Obama did not use his Constitutional authority to issue an emergency EO to ban the sale of bump stocks, and pressure his Congress to do something about it. He issued an EO for DACA, so why not bump stocks?
924 2018-03-25 16:43:22 I have to admit I’ve never heard this angle before...will have to research it. Meantime, what if the US could keep most of the 300M guns it has, just not bump stocks or assault weapons.  Would that still count as sufficient armament?  If yes then common ground may be found.
925 2018-03-25 16:42:49 And Obama did not use his Constitutional authority to issue an emergency EO to ban the sale of bump stocks, and pressure his Congress to do something about it. He issued an EO for DACA, so why not bump stocks?
926 2018-03-25 16:42:33 Ask yourselves why it is so important to them to push so hard for gun control now? Why is this suddenly at the top of their agenda? Because they want to declare martial law in the U.S. and guns in the hands of citizens, esp big guns (even bump stocks) prevents them from ML.
927 2018-03-25 16:42:32 Bump stocks overt machine gun ban, I don't care how you word it or measure it. It's an inch that never should have been! Saving lives should be your goal, not protecting an attatchment for a gun!
928 2018-03-25 16:41:42 What's your record this season again? How strong is your conference again? 
929 2018-03-25 16:41:32 "No one wants to take your guns"
Except all the semi automatics, all the long guns if youre under 21, all the bump stocks/echo triggers, and all the standard capacity magazines... Not to mention everything else that has been taken in the last 100 years.
930 2018-03-25 16:41:27 Thanks for the reminder..i think quite a few quality midcap stocks have not budged from their recent highs eg. Pidilite, titan. Midcap panic will be only when they start correcting.
931 2018-03-25 16:41:15 Guns are like stocks, everyone thinks they are an expert, but only few are really knowledgeable
932 2018-03-25 16:40:40 So change doesn't come from background checks, banning bump stocks nor raising minimum age to purchase! These are feel good protesters goals!
933 2018-03-25 16:39:25 #NitinBhatia 

Sir how to enter and exit in circuit stocks?
934 2018-03-25 16:39:24 Very shameful for the Nigeria Army. Even ur mode of operations is questionable. Army in Nigeria nowadays is a laughing stocks
935 2018-03-25 16:38:37 So universal background checks, raising the age to purchase, and banning bump stocks will lead to a civil war that will somehow wipe out everyone on the planet? 

How does that happen? People start having to fill out an extra form to own a gun and the world riots?
936 2018-03-25 16:38:29 As someone who owns stocks, I never thought I’d be hoping for a 3 year bear market, but if it will help get rid of the wannabe dictator who is ruining our country I’m ready.
937 2018-03-25 16:38:24 You’re right bump stocks are not necessary and any trained gun owner would never use one. But there are tons of things not necessary in this world NoS in vehicles yet we still have it. Are you aware that lawn fertilizer can be used as an explosive? But that isn’t banned.
938 2018-03-25 16:37:04 Monday all the high beta stocks will rally, banks & metals will lead the rally, also to show the NAV higher  big players will not allow  further correction near march end
939 2018-03-25 16:36:28 Marquette paranoia again. The article isn’t about MU it’s about UW. Perhaps Tom can write an article as to why MU who is getting all this talent can’t win consistently?
940 2018-03-25 16:35:52 Assault weapons r banned have been for a long time !!! You liberals can’t eve get that part right!! An AR-15 is just a semi auto rifle,, a 9mm is semi auto too!!  A lot of hunting rifles r too! Most people r fine with outlawing bump stocks and high capacity clips!
941 2018-03-25 16:35:48 But did you know that the NRA advocated banning bump stocks?
942 2018-03-25 16:35:43 No, Feel Good laws are ineffective 

Raising age to 21,MD shooter was 17
Banning bump stocks, neither MD/Parkland were bump stock 
What gun law would've prevented recent Austin bombing ?

How about Fix NICS? Bipartisan & NRA support
Also, NOT demonizing other side helps!

946 2018-03-25 16:33:56 He legally acquired the guns he used. There was no way to know what he would do with them and no way to stop him, because the guns, bump stocks, and magazines were all legal. We can change that.

949 2018-03-25 16:33:17 Technically speaking, you probably meant assault rifle, and not machine gun, but yeah bump stocks are still legal for 90 days I think, so yeah.. 'Murica
950 2018-03-25 16:33:10 Can you suggest some stocks
951 2018-03-25 16:33:04 That's not how it works. No one legalized bump stocks.
952 2018-03-25 16:32:42 Please explain how banning AR’s is changing the constitution? Does banning bump stocks infringe on your rights somehow? Limited magazine sizes does that hurt it? Background checks? No didn’t think so. Let’s look up how much money the NRA gave you while you were in office shall we
953 2018-03-25 16:31:33 Omfg deux jours de suite qu’il y a un camion à glaces en bas de. chez moi, à un cheveu descendre faire mes stocks
954 2018-03-25 16:31:21 I’m doing it by investing in as many things as I can, from mutual funds and stocks to business ideas. Basically the goal is to allocate money to things that will make you more money
955 2018-03-25 16:30:41 But what is the result of that then? Do you think they wouldn't lay off those people if they hadn't lost that money? If they are laying off people because they lost money by gambling in stocks, they would have layed them off anyway.
956 2018-03-25 16:30:25 Crazy to think a few years ago a million people marched for freedom and equality and today people are marching to demand the government take away their rights. Also bump stocks and age restrictions aren’t stopping anyone.

960 2018-03-25 16:28:53 Thank God for President Trump banning bump stocks.
961 2018-03-25 16:28:21 Hmmmm!! one of the companies that's going to lose big chunk in stocks :P
962 2018-03-25 16:28:08 You're looking for credibility from HS kids which is your first mistake. . 2nd nothing is going to happen because neither the left or the right will commit to a common ground. I am strongly against full gun control but i am not against banning bump stocks.
963 2018-03-25 16:27:55 Hosting today .....BAD IDEA cause I’m tryna get this makeup when it stocks at 12 so I’m on my phone ALOT
964 2018-03-25 16:27:54 Also, funny how the whole point flew past your head. You skipped the issue of bump stocks making semis fully automatic and my allusion to the point that people are STOCKPILING these weapons of war.
965 2018-03-25 16:27:26 As a gun owner I believe in the second amendment , but  I don't believe that we should be selling A R- 15 bum stocks ect... To people and we need back ground checks. We don't need these guns to hunt. It doesn't make u a bigger man if u have a gun like that.
966 2018-03-25 16:27:26 People in this movement have offered compromise in allowing 2A to stand. Gun nuts now have to give things like assault weapons and bump stocks, & allow universal background checks, and licensing and insurance requirements. You could lead them there, if you had any balls at all.
967 2018-03-25 16:27:11 The quartet of technology stocks that has driven Wall Street indices to record highs in recent years may be breaking up, possibly undermining one of the best growth stories in a nine-year bull market.
968 2018-03-25 16:26:57 Yeah, I know a few NRA guys and they like to hunt and they love their guns. They keep them locked in safes and take the responsibility very seriously. One of the staunchest I know opposes bump stocks and supports background checks. The NRA is not Wayne LaPierre and Dana Lousch.
969 2018-03-25 16:26:55 Anyone any la versus Tetris pretty awesome looking forward Bump STOCKS will VELTPVP
970 2018-03-25 16:26:30 The quartet of technology stocks that has driven Wall Street indices to record highs in recent years may be breaking up, possibly undermining one of the best growth stories in a nine-year bull market.
971 2018-03-25 16:25:39 Don't watch the market closely," he advised those worried about their retirement savings at the time. "If they're trying to buy and sell stocks, and worry when they go down a little bit … and think they should maybe sell them when they go up, they're not going to have very good
972 2018-03-25 16:25:14 The risk takers will see Facebook's crisis as a one time opportunity to price FB stocks at a steal, considering the bullish market situation
973 2018-03-25 16:25:07 Of course. But using suicide deaths to justify a ban on assault rifles and bump stocks is disingenuous.
974 2018-03-25 16:23:18 They don't always retire those shares, Homer.  Who the fuck do you think they give those shares to?  

That money is still taken OUT OF THE ECONOMY.   Yes, reinvested in over priced stocks, not spent on goods that create GDP.
975 2018-03-25 16:23:01 Thus, the pro-gun folks supporting a bump stock ban actually undermine their own opposition to banning semi autos. Slippery slope, in other words.

If the complaint is bump stocks let ppl shoot the guns too fast, well, that same fire rate can be done without the bump stock. See?
976 2018-03-25 16:22:45 The gun culture thinks anyone should have  semi-automatic rifles and guns because they don’t want any regulation. The gun culture thinks high magazine sizes or bump stocks are cool and don’t want them taken away.
977 2018-03-25 16:22:40 Why can the ATF regulate silencers but not bump stocks?
978 2018-03-25 16:22:34 My point is ppl don’t like bump stocks bc of the rate of fire one may achieve with one. The problem with that mentality (for an otherwise pro-gun person) is that by that same rationale one should logically want to ban the guns bc the same rate of fire may be obtained without one.
979 2018-03-25 16:22:19 Yeah, nope. Dr. Pepper is it's own company, you can get a Dr. Pepper whether its a Coca-cola or a Pepsi place (if the place stocks it). You tried

981 2018-03-25 16:22:00 ATF seems committed to their Catch-22 stance - keep toxic bump stocks or they will shoot the hostage of existing sound gun law.  Something VERY WRONG there.  CAN'T BE TRUSTED. INVESTIGATE!
982 2018-03-25 16:21:54 Expect fast food stocks to hit all time highs Monday. Thanks Kellyanne “con” Whey
983 2018-03-25 16:21:30 And b4 AR15's, bump stocks etc. #NeverAgain# MarchForOurLives #BanAssaultWeapons
984 2018-03-25 16:20:52 Hmmm I see what you are saying. Do you think the solutions the students proposed - BR checks, banning bump stocks, etc. - would disarm responsible gun owners?

I wouldn't say I trust the government fully, but idt firearms keep the govt from infringing on free speech.
985 2018-03-25 16:20:48 Thus, the pro-gun folks supporting a bump stock ban actually undermine their own opposition to banning semi autos. Slippery slope, in other words.

If the complaint is bump stocks let ppl shoot the guns too fast, well, that same fire rate can be done without the bump stock. See?
986 2018-03-25 16:20:40 Bump stocks sure. Magazines (not clips FYI) doesn’t really matter, changing them is fast. Raising prices is complete bs since you would be punishing low income especially in rural areas.
987 2018-03-25 16:19:28 Specialty weapons, ARs, bumb stocks, automatics, explosives. These shouldn't exist in a common world, these should strictly be reserved for the men and women who protect our country and those who receive proper training.
988 2018-03-25 16:19:27 if Trump continues China tariff nonsense w BAD advice from relics..Ross and Navarro..and stocks crater hard w fear of trade wars /global slowdown....polls will reverse on a dime....ask McCain re Sept/2008 when Lehman collapsed and world credit markets froze in epic crash moment
989 2018-03-25 16:19:01 Would breast implants be considered “ Bump Stocks” in relation to weaponizing the uterus?
990 2018-03-25 16:18:51 My point is ppl don’t like bump stocks bc of the rate of fire one may achieve with one. The problem with that mentality (for an otherwise pro-gun person) is that by that same rationale one should logically want to ban the guns bc the same rate of fire may be obtained without one.
991 2018-03-25 16:17:59 Bump stocks are NOT the problem.
992 2018-03-25 16:17:50 I think wheatietoo of CTH (@TheLastRefuge2) has the answer - bump stocks were a TROJAN HORSE that Obama's DOJ, FBI and ATF planned to use to sabotage gun law.  We are JUST STARTING to see the roles of DOJ and FBI in the conspiracy.  We do not yet know the role of ATF in this!
993 2018-03-25 16:17:11 No bump stocks, more thorough background, no need for military grade weaponry, HIPAA should not apply to anyone buying a gun (medical privacy...you agree to make psych history available), no large capacity clips
994 2018-03-25 16:14:37 Reality needs life stocks so I can start all over again
995 2018-03-25 16:14:25 I would like them to ban assault rifles and bump stocks (I think they just banned bump stocks).
996 2018-03-25 16:14:19 I marched in Dayton Ohio in freezing cold as millions in US marched.  Glad to hear, and tell all against the march, that President said he supports the marchers & is banning bump stocks, is for tougher background checks. That's a start & we need to work together on terrorists
997 2018-03-25 16:13:38 God and moving on gettin' pleasure started slangin two thousand, I had begin with stocks, wail on walls engraved all day
998 2018-03-25 16:12:37 He's not even serving THEM:  His pet tariff war is tanking the stocks of all his billionaire friends, newly rolling in their #GOPTaxScam dough.

He only cares about HIMSELF, and said so in October 2016.  Too bad most of America didn't realize it, or listen!
999 2018-03-25 16:12:34 Donald? You are lying again. You know the Obama admin didn’t legalize bump stocks. You also should know you cannot change a law by EO (or having DOJ issue a new law). So this little tweet is a lie about what was and what will be. Want the truth? Of course you don’t. #liarinchief
1000 2018-03-25 16:12:17 My dream journal today: Jack's in a box. There is no doorzy on it. I have a birds' eye view into the situation. Checking if his face is in the book already. Then woke up to reality. I'm taking stocks.
1001 2018-03-25 16:11:55 the thread is really good. the proposals in the link at the end are ... ? a lot of gun owners (including me) support ERPOs in theory, but in practice are pretty certain they will be abused. treating bump stocks as machine guns would seem to exacerbate that fear.
1002 2018-03-25 16:11:52 I find donor advised funds such as @FidelityChrtbl as great for this.  You can donate to them (especially stocks with long-term gains) and then recommend anonymous or name-only-with-no-address donations out of the fund.
1003 2018-03-25 16:11:04 Wasn’t Sandy Hook under his watch? Didn’t he approve the sale of bump stocks? His hypocritical behavior is beyond repulsive. #2A #2012vs2018
1004 2018-03-25 16:11:00 No, they are not fully banned. High capacity magazines and bump stocks are mass casualty add ins. You don’t need a carbine to defend yourself.
1005 2018-03-25 16:10:40 Really ... banning large capacity magazines, renew the assault weapons ban, banning bump stocks, universal background checks, wait periods ... all have been proposed multiple time & voted down by the @GOP 

All of these though were implied as lega in the Heller decision.
1006 2018-03-25 16:10:33 Bump stocks don’t kill people. Prevent illegal guns on the street and change policies on arms purchases. It shouldn’t be easier to buy an AR-15 than a 40 glock, y?, cus it can be hidden? Tf!
1007 2018-03-25 16:10:12 Dumb shit, no one said take away your guns. Just reasonable gun laws on assault weapons high-capacity magazines and bump stocks
1008 2018-03-25 16:10:04 why is no one asking does porton down hold stocks of or produced any of this nerve agent and has Sergei Skripal had any contact with anyone connected to or working at porton down
1009 2018-03-25 16:09:47 Until we have utter clarity on what happened in #LasVegas and #Parkland, including an investigation into ATF's role (all communications between ATF and DOJ relevant to bump stocks, semi-auto, etc.), then there should be NO ACTION. America's gun owners were SET UP and SLANDERED.
1010 2018-03-25 16:09:13 I agree. Anyone who grew up with huge stocks of candles in their kitchen cupboards, will never forget how winter was targeted to disrupt heat/light supplies to our most vulnerable. Nasty nasty mentality that still threatens our ill and our childrens education.
1011 2018-03-25 16:08:56 You can’t blame parents or law enforcement on the Las Vegas shooter. He was able to amass an arsenal of weapons legally including bump stocks to make the weapon able to kill even more people. People asking for reform are not saying to take all the guns, but let’s do what we can!
1012 2018-03-25 16:08:14 Who said anything about bump stocks.
Can you make even an attempt at a valid point without a straw man to burn down?
And I don't care what any "we" hat youte a part of needs. The colonists had the British army. But it was their own government oppressing them.
1013 2018-03-25 16:07:53 Not with bump stocks and bigger mags, which is what a lot of mass shooters use. The wrong person could get their hands on anything but why not make it harder for them? It could delay something where at least authorities could be alerted of suspicious behavior or instead of mowing
1014 2018-03-25 16:07:52 @HiHonorIndia where is view 10? Out of stock everywhere. Clearing your honor 8 pro stocks?
1015 2018-03-25 16:07:06 Hey @GiveBloodNHS - being told stocks are low and you need my blood, but having donated last July, then cancelled due to illness, I still can’t get an appointment anywhere on the IOW. Looked up to August and all full!
1016 2018-03-25 16:06:46 Could it be anger towards the president?  I'm not a gun advocate, and more gun laws seems reasonable.  It is also reasonable to think that (raising the age, removing bump stocks) still leaves a motivated individual plenty of options to do harm if he/she wants.
1017 2018-03-25 16:06:37 Umm no Obama Admin tried to ban Bump Stocks.  Reuplicans blocked it like they did everything he and his admin tried to do,  your just to flacky to admit it.  Now that your in office your banning them and taking the credit like the punk you are
1018 2018-03-25 16:06:08 It depends on the state, but yes. Bump stocks are legal for civilians.
1019 2018-03-25 16:05:55 President trump, bump stocks don’t turn rifles into machine guns, you are very mistaken
1020 2018-03-25 16:05:23 Perfectly normal!
1021 2018-03-25 16:05:15 This Fox news commentator wasn't paying attention #MarchForOurLives  was not lesson on the second amendment, That argument was a figment of his imagination.  March promoted registering to vote, banning military style guns and bump stocks, citizen safety, end buying politicians
1022 2018-03-25 16:04:29 Bump Stocks - fully auto machine guns & gangs proliferated from the illegitimate act of Prohibition, and then to combat that crime, the National Firearms Act was passed the year after the Prohibiton ended.  Why would you support further illegitimate acts?
1023 2018-03-25 16:03:56 This mentions nothing of bump stocks
1024 2018-03-25 16:03:47 More than incredible, it was beautiful. Lives matter more than the right to buy assault rifles, high powered handguns, large ammunition clips, bump stocks. This is our country and we’re taking it back
1025 2018-03-25 16:03:27 As @SenFeinstein has pointed out, bump stocks cannot be banned in this way, it will take a change in law. His handlers know that so this is an empty gesture condoned by NRA to be tied up in court forever and meanwhile boost sales. Trump is a weasel.
1026 2018-03-25 16:02:25 This is not a movement to ban all guns. This is a demand for sensible gun laws; Background checks, banning bump stocks and assault weapons, allowing the CDC to research causes of gun violence. Threatening a civil war is alarmist. The majority of the county supports gun control.
1027 2018-03-25 16:01:27 Never said the nra is bad. But, when they won’t acknowledge an issue with let’s say bump stocks, someone owning 28 guns, having people with mental disorders be allowed to buy guys, then yeah the nra is the problem. PP didn’t campaign or buy officials to allow bump stocks
1028 2018-03-25 16:01:26 Why do U lie, lie, lie. Obama did NOT OK bump stocks! He tried to fix the gun laws BUT the Republicans would NOT allow it! Get story right!
1029 2018-03-25 16:01:07 Again, I am not for a total gun ban. The majority of us are not for a total gun ban. It’s unrealistic with our powerful second amendment. We just want to make semi-automatics and bump stocks illegal. Is that too much to ask?
1030 2018-03-25 16:00:57 If bump stocks and other devices are banned, what stops people from printing them on 3D printers?
1031 2018-03-25 15:59:52 Bump stocks was a gift to settle down the anti gun clowns. Now take a deep breath, now breath out slowly.
1032 2018-03-25 15:59:25 Umm yes they are exactly suggesting taking guns. Quote from yesterday’s march “ they gave us an inch with bump stocks, now let’s take a mile”
1033 2018-03-25 15:58:19 Wait until the embassy opens. 
Stock Market stopped growing when the tax cuts passed. 
Stocks started nose diving when tariffs were announced.
1034 2018-03-25 15:58:16 @realDonaldTrump STOP letting the NRA rule your conscious. You are a grandfather..God for bid your grandkids could be next. Banning bump stocks still preserves the 2nd Ammendment and helps saves innocent lives. Military agrees assault weapons should be banned
1035 2018-03-25 15:57:44 Thank you for doing this! Perhaps you can elevate a call to action in CT - our legislators are voting on bills to ban ghost guns and bump stocks this week. My group is organizing phone banks and we need people to make phone calls! Can you help spread the word?
1036 2018-03-25 15:57:08 So cynical! You can keep your guns nobidy is taking them away. Just assault weapons that are meant to kill lots of people in seconds! AR15 with bump stocks are only for military
1037 2018-03-25 15:56:29 Haven't touched my portfolio in months. I wanna add more stocks & coins soon.
1038 2018-03-25 15:56:23 Ok. But Millions marched yesterday.
All around the country.
There will be stricter gun laws.
Trump is in line too, when it comes to bump stocks and more thorough background checks. 
Good discussing with you.
1039 2018-03-25 15:56:23 No, Obama’s administration did not “legalize” bump stocks. During that time, they were unregulated devices, therefore ineligible to be made legal. What he did do is make it harder for mentally ill people to get guns, a measure you immediately rolled back. You’re the villain.
1040 2018-03-25 15:56:16 NO to Kailo debate.  NO to man on twitter that said firearms are his God given right and not open to debate.  God doesn't sell firearms. Enough BS debate.  President to ban bump stocks, DO IT.  Raising age to 21, Stronger background checks, DO IT.  SAFE SCHOOLS is not for debate.
1041 2018-03-25 15:55:51 Learned of your app today! I will set this up today! #finance #stocks #patience #wealth
1042 2018-03-25 15:55:42 dunno. if you're abiding by the laws, it shouldn't be a problem to see things like bump stocks banned b/c reg folk don't need them any damn way. waiting periods & restrictions shouldn't be an issue either
1043 2018-03-25 15:55:39 He doesn't have to do any of it an bump stocks who cares they just ruin aim
1044 2018-03-25 15:55:15 Sir u r forgetting 1 thing this GST was well accepted by most of the countries, & all t poltcl parties of Ind incldng Cong CMs, bill was passed in Upper/Lower houses. & More over centre & states r getting good revenue. In vat  traders were got stocks, 1 with bill, 1 without bill
1045 2018-03-25 15:55:14 Difficult finding reasons to leave the house or a purpose this morning ... but finding a local store in Toronto that stocks Akbar or Do Ghazal tea sounds like a pretty good short-term life mission
1046 2018-03-25 15:55:05 Yes, you're right. Also, a friend of mine, let me know that he in Germany ratting Jewish and stolen the gold belonging them comes to America and buying stocks with that dirty gold, made his wealth. This  crap is dictatind the rules in the lefties groups, Dems and communists. Thx
1047 2018-03-25 15:55:02 Bump stocks? Do something!
1048 2018-03-25 15:54:54 Alhamdulillah stocks for Big Box all Sold! Syukur!
Thank u Awaks for ur purchases, support & duas 
Cayang yuuu 
Next booth? Update u tmr ok! Night 
1049 2018-03-25 15:54:19 I’m not too afraid. I won’t be selling any time soon. I view my stocks as being “on sale,” so will be putting more money in.
1050 2018-03-25 15:53:39 @realDonaldTrump So who do you answer to Putin, NRA or both? You certainly not a POTUS for the people. Your Fox friends..FAKE News organization refers to "Your Government"...correction the people's government. Ban bump stocks or we vote all of you out!!!!#NeverAgain
1051 2018-03-25 15:52:58 It was great to see @TheJusticeDept do that, indeed. However, without actual legislation banning bump stocks, the current, or future administrations can simply change the DOJ's interpretation of current law, and legalize bump stocks again.
1052 2018-03-25 15:52:45 Not for nothing, but Trump did announce he's banning bump stocks.
1053 2018-03-25 15:52:20 Automatic rifles OK, but Bump Stocks which turn rifles into automatic rifles not? Get real Trump!!who do you think you're kidding
1054 2018-03-25 15:52:19 Conflicted, should I sell some gold stocks to re-enter some mj positions? Lithium holdings are full and content. Be pissed if gold makes a huge rally and I sold it too soon. Maybe just start a go-fund-me so I can keep them all lol.
1055 2018-03-25 15:51:27 Stocks are running out! PM now to order or reserve yours 09178077393 :)
1056 2018-03-25 15:51:21 "In bear markets, short setups often continue to work even during oversold conditions, especially during the initial stage lower" via  @ivanhoff2 . Investors can buy their setup stocks at lower levels, traders will get butchered. Traders stay away.
1057 2018-03-25 15:51:11 @ABC can someone tell me why anyone needs an AR15? It is weapon for killing people. I am not advocating the repeal of 2nd amendment rights. We don’t need bump stocks, large capacity mags, or AR15’s!
1058 2018-03-25 15:50:22 #VetsForGunReform
Trump coughing up to ban Bump Stocks. BFD
YouTube has plenty of instructional videos of how to Bump Fire a semiautomatic rifle without a Bump Stock. 
It's not the stocks it's, the weapon and capacity that are the culprits.
1059 2018-03-25 15:50:15 Quickest of 2 stocks, damn
1060 2018-03-25 15:50:13 I'm late to the party, I agree with the president BUMP STOCKS should be banned, The hunters and patriots of America don't need military weapons to take down a tyrannical government. That's the military's job - lead by patriots.
We The People
1061 2018-03-25 15:50:11 It’s a platform where you put money into a browser extension and then immediately start trading non fungible assets with anyone in the world. Sure it’s cute cat pics right now, but if the first app was for trading stocks, that would be really irresponsible.
1062 2018-03-25 15:49:38 X Reviewing that Feb 10 video How to find stocks in a correction, awesome  video..
1063 2018-03-25 15:49:20 Ok genius. 
What rights are being taken away?
Right to kill kids?
Right to kill tourists?
Nobody is taking away all guns.
Is this what our soldiers are dying for?
Freedom of ar15s not just guns?
Freedom of bump stocks not students?
1064 2018-03-25 15:48:50 Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. GOOLA IDEA. Sa me promised today du Department ta Justice soong issue du
1065 2018-03-25 15:48:25 You know what's funny that turncoat Trump signed an executive order Banning bun stocks..ok.. there have been zero bump stocks turned in LOL out of all the millions of sales 0 were turned in that's exactly how laws work
1066 2018-03-25 15:48:18 If you are marching to get the number 1 selling gun off the streets I’m sry to inform you but I feel you are being naive. The more you march the higher the stocks rise for gun companies. U marching only raises their stocks....and in turn their financial power
1067 2018-03-25 15:47:59 Exactly. As a woman from a diverse, densely populated urban area - the places that strike fear in the hearts of the chickenshit weaklings justifying their bump stocks - I've moved about freely + safely, never once considering arming myself to run to Sephora, walk my dogs @ night.
1068 2018-03-25 15:47:47 I'm actually against bump stocks. They circumvent safety features of firearms. I'm also totally against the tweet. Fuck right off. You want to nibble away at freedom. I will stand up against that. Every time.
1069 2018-03-25 15:47:39 Thanks for the heads up @lomadia If anyone has ever met me, I ain't the sporty type. Nor do I have an interest in Playtex stocks. 
1070 2018-03-25 15:47:27 check recent history.
gop/nra blocked.
 1 funding of cdc study into gun violence. 
2 universal background checks.
3 mandatory reporting by states to.   nics. 
4 waiting period for rifles/shotguns.
5 legislation to make bump stocks illegal.
6 raising minamum age to buy firearms
1071 2018-03-25 15:47:07 Domestic Terrorism was the point made. Unfortunately we can’t remove states to justify a hypothetical. On the bright side more homeless means more customers for private prisons. Any other PP stocks I should look at? #makemoney
1072 2018-03-25 15:46:52 Della #MarchForOurLives mi sfugge anzitutto la tempistica: tutti silenti mentre si davano miliardi in armi a "ribelli" vari, si rivoltava con le armi mezzo Medio Oriente, si legalizzavano i bump stocks. Ora c'è chi vuole cambiare corso: tutti a manifestare 
1073 2018-03-25 15:46:46 @MMMNightShift Ban the leadership group and bring back the stocks in the town square.
1074 2018-03-25 15:45:56 CT Friends - if you feel inspired by the marches yesterday, I have an opportunity for you to take that inspiration and put it into practical, meaningful action: calling voters to ask them to to call their legislators to vote to ban ghost guns and bump stocks. 1/
1075 2018-03-25 15:45:24 Invading forces? We have that. It's called the U.S. Military! We do not need you. My point is you fail to acknowledge what actually establishes freedom and holds a country together. It ain't bump stocks and AR-15s in the hands of civilians.
1076 2018-03-25 15:45:16 Amazing, you could have left out the obama part and no dems/libs would be upset. But instead you add the obama part and when they are upset it looks like they support bump stocks. And a lot of them are too stupid to realize it. Then your supporters beliefs are reinforced. Ughh
1077 2018-03-25 15:45:09 Eliminate bump stocks, stop sales of military grade weaponry, no extended clips, stricter background (with psych making HIPAA act not apply if buying a weapon), longer waiting period...the list goes on. There are plenty of options available that can be explored.
1078 2018-03-25 15:44:37 yes . He also invested in Graham type Korean stocks in his personal  portfolio.
1079 2018-03-25 15:44:33 And then they probably invested some of that $400 million from #Traitor44 through shadow companies in Iran oil stocks-the manipulated oil stocks make a profit and low and behold dividends are paid to insiders who provided the money&manipulated the market
1080 2018-03-25 15:44:14 It would be a great school project to have these kids read the new bill, understand how bump stocks effect access to guns. These kids r being driven by emotion that is being fueled by the Dems. The Dems r brilliant when it comes to this and the republicans suck!
1081 2018-03-25 15:44:13 No I said lending platforms lol 
We are just trading now. Easiest way for you to understand, we trade crypto like people trade stocks lol
1082 2018-03-25 15:44:12 I was more referring to the high capacity magazines than anything else. Banning drum magazines, bump stocks, etc. would go a long way by itself. Personally, I would ban semi-automatic rifles altogether...the AR-15 is a combat weapon, not well-suited for hunting or protection
1083 2018-03-25 15:43:45 Here's @BoomBoom4Real rule of thumb for what your allocation should be in your retirement plan: your age should determine how much you should be in bonds (versus stocks.) If you're 25 = 25% bonds, 75% stocks. Age 45 = 45% bonds, 55% stocks. Tune in to @SXMUrbanView for more!
1084 2018-03-25 15:43:39 I agree about bump stocks. However I disagree about ar-15s. Charles Whitman killed 15 people and injured an additional 31 with a bolt action Remington 700. That’s a “hunting rifle”. Many people hunt with at-15s tho. So where is the line?
1085 2018-03-25 15:43:24 He is trying to pass a law making the bump stocks illegal which is a start.  They will never completely do away with guns.  I do hope they make it much more difficult in purchasing guns though.  We do need more regulations.  Totally for that.
1086 2018-03-25 15:43:01 Bump stocks.
1087 2018-03-25 15:42:44 At the march the students said these things- register voters & educate them on the issues. Vote in 226 days in midterm elections (and beyond). Looking to support candidates and laws that 1. Ban bump stocks 2. Ban assault weapons 3. Ban high capacity magazines. 
1088 2018-03-25 15:42:09 We need to look at people who have spent massive amounts of cash on Solar stocks and then started government tax breaks for solar. A simple search will show who purchased these stock and donated cash to the Democrats. 

@MariaBartiromo @SundayFutures @realDonaldTrump
1089 2018-03-25 15:41:37 Greater security for who can obtain a gun: background checks and waiting period in every state so that people with a history of criminal activity, serious mental illness, or domestic violence can’t get one for starters. No automatic weapons, bump stocks, or silencers. Reasonable.
1090 2018-03-25 15:40:40 + don't build your entire design out of stocks unless it's a photo manipulation or something
1091 2018-03-25 15:40:21 No need to wonder... Banking stocks are talking to us... $BKX broke it's February "Crash" low and closed under it and XLF just 6 cts away... What's that got to do with Tariffs?
1092 2018-03-25 15:40:17 The president has already taken the leap to do all those things including banning bump stocks.... why haven’t you said anything publicly to all of your peers about that?
1093 2018-03-25 15:39:57 Bump stocks don’t do that.
1094 2018-03-25 15:39:43 ARE YOU KIDDING ME???????????? REMEMBER ""BUMP STOCKS????"" HE USED THEM.....WATCH THE RECORDING OF IT........AUTOMATIC FIRE....THAT ""IS"" ALL THAT WAS HEARD!!! YOU DO NOT EVEN HAVE THE GUTS TO TELL THE TRUTH OF WHAT HAPPENED IN VEGAS!!!! JUST TO SUPPORT YOUR IGNORANCE!!!
1095 2018-03-25 15:39:37 Agree with you on $BB. Lots of positive news lately, but worry that market sentiment in tech stocks has soured recently
1096 2018-03-25 15:39:28 Asked [by Fox News] what new legislation he wants to see... "Raising the federal age of gun ownership and possession to the age of 21; banning all bump stocks; making sure that we have universal background checks...”
1097 2018-03-25 15:38:45 The NRA has been trying to ban bump stocks because they are not needed and they also don't allow selective fire. Look up what a bump stock actually is
1098 2018-03-25 15:38:13 Problem w polling is that everyone has a different idea of what "gun legislation" means. Is it?
-Banning bump stocks
-Universal background checks
-Expanding mental health reporting
-Banning s.a. rifles
-Repealing #2A

It's not binary.
1099 2018-03-25 15:37:17 How about our own kids- who stood up yesterday- come on John! I’m a Vet, you’re a Vet and we both know the 2d is a stretch for bump stocks and no one but military need AR15s, AK47s etc. you’re wrong on this one. Period!
1100 2018-03-25 15:37:14 It's not ingenious to say they *couldn't* stop them. I'd agree with *didn't* stop them. I'd also agree with *didn't try to* stop them.

But clearly, they weren't approved by Trump, which is really my original point. Why blame Trump for bump stocks [yet]?
1101 2018-03-25 15:36:52 #pietruck makes rare public appearance today on the upper west side @GrandBazaarNYC  100 West 77th St. We're here until 5.30pm. Free ANZAC cookie with each pie, while stocks last!
1102 2018-03-25 15:36:37 Buy the stocks when there is blood on street , period. Investing is simple but not easy.
1103 2018-03-25 15:35:46 @realDonaldTrump 
Hey Little D Hands, how's your stocks doing, mine sux, thank you for the tarrifs.
1104 2018-03-25 15:35:28 Dude, if you think you need bump stocks aka AUTO RIFLES to defend yourself>> you just need better aim. Practice more.
1105 2018-03-25 15:35:07 If you want to be more hands own with selecting the funds in your retirement plan you want to be mindful of your ALLOCATION and your RISK TOLERANCE! Conservative Allocation = More bonds, less stocks. Riskier Allocation = More stocks, less bonds. Tune to @SXMUrbanView for more!
1106 2018-03-25 15:34:50 In Wall St., there had been a sell-off in the stock markets. If it continues for months, the brokerage firms will be out of business for no investors will ever put their money to buy stocks when all is lost in a war of trades.
1107 2018-03-25 15:33:54 Can we stop with the false dichotomy? It's not "gun rights" on one side and "anti gun rights" on the other. I respect the right of individuals to own firearms. There is no right to bump stocks, unregulated sales, lack of background checks, and semi automatic rifles. #NeverAgain
1108 2018-03-25 15:33:33 It should be a package deal this November if not earlier:  ban on assault weapons, bump stocks, magazine size, mental competency,background checks, age limits, waiting day period, buy back programs.  Sane gun owners should not feel threatened by this.  NRA will no doubt.
1109 2018-03-25 15:33:28 It always amazes me that the last two dominant teams in #f1 were laughing stocks 15 years ago - Merc were BAR and Red Bull were Jaguar
1110 2018-03-25 15:32:55 If you can't, or rather won't, see the point, I suggest therapy. And Trump hasn't banned bump stocks, he is talking about it. He talks about lots of things.  Lock her up, repeal Obamacare, build the wall, drain the swamp lol
1111 2018-03-25 15:32:52 I grew up around guns. My Dad still has a hand gun but, not 50 guns and hundreds of rounds ammo high capacity magazines bump stocks and all this crap! There needs to be some common sense gun law reform here. It's a house not a military base. Just saying.
1112 2018-03-25 15:32:51 Sincere question...Why does any peaceable citizen need bump stocks & how are they considered weapons, not accessories? Thank you for your consideration.
1113 2018-03-25 15:32:11 they're not "my" bump stocks. Obviosly they should be banned as long as full auto guns are banned.
1114 2018-03-25 15:31:37 That s why he's filed for bankruptcy multiple times, and has a failed airline and university, not to mention the huge crash in stocks recently. Such a good business man.
1115 2018-03-25 15:30:54 As a day trader i tried to learn candle and few oscillators , and last one week i just tried with few stocks and nifty , play with support and resistance , and doing demo trade , i hope it will work for me , last one week success rate 80 percent
1116 2018-03-25 15:29:01 Ok, path dependency means the way history affects what we do in the present. Eg people are reluctant to buy stocks because CAPES are high but eventually find out that doesn't matter like it used to. I didn't understand the meaning of that word. It's a good one.
1117 2018-03-25 15:27:57 Again... if bump stocks make no difference, why are you bitching about a possible ban?

Did you decide that I was a "gun banner" based on your reactionary personality?
1118 2018-03-25 15:27:54 Historically stocks have done well with rising rates. #onverra
1119 2018-03-25 15:27:21 @stocks_william
1120 2018-03-25 15:26:57 index changes better passive: e.g. inc in new stocks met by new inflows only when there is inflow. Else index co using op to screw us
1121 2018-03-25 15:26:52 It was banned, so the @NRA #NRAIsATerroristOrganization got around it with semiautomatic mass-killing weapons with bump stocks.
@GOP #GOPComplicit
1122 2018-03-25 15:26:51 Liar!  Just stop it.  Any intelligent person knows the bump stocks were a loop hole in the law that the Republicans refuse to close up.
1123 2018-03-25 15:26:06 deez ppl attak'n fb & mi stocks R idiots √ dey hav no wave & no following . we dun erAse our history evr
1124 2018-03-25 15:24:54 NRA spokespeople only are sniping at the students they've identified as their enemies.  They aren't thinking about what they're saying--emotion is causing them to pull their verbal triggers.  It's like they have bump stocks for their mouths--they're firing indiscriminately.
1125 2018-03-25 15:24:44 I guess rapidfire is still the name of the GSFC server farm. But, I will try to avoid using it so no association with bump stocks.
1126 2018-03-25 15:24:15 You can have bump stocks most gun owners never heard of them before last Vegas. Semi autos aren't going anywhere
1127 2018-03-25 15:23:57 Actually, if you really think that stocks will decrease in value, you can 'short' the same stocks that you own.  Then you are protected against any decline.
1128 2018-03-25 15:23:43 Your guns are safe, the NRA is not going anywhere, bump stocks sucked anyway & were part of a Dem initiative, probably because they knew they decrease accuracy, Nah, have already proven they know jack shit about guns anyway.  What is all of this deflecting in current events?
#KAG
1129 2018-03-25 15:23:35 We're talking about guns here. So you're saying that no reform will save lives? Not one? No restrictions on bump stocks? No mandated safety course? No mandatory insurance? More in-depth background check?
1130 2018-03-25 15:23:17 HeyJemele. Did you know that owning a tank is legal? Crazy, right?!? I am still trying to figure out why bump stocks, which have nothing to do with a gun’s ability to fire, are seen as protected by 2amend. Crazy, right?!?
1131 2018-03-25 15:22:51 People that speak in generalities like you; are lying.  Everything in one broad stroke.  U have no specifics.  And, when we point out the specific good things @POTUS has done such as ban bump stocks versus @BarackObama legalizing them, u retreat into a one liner “dude, u lie...”
1132 2018-03-25 15:22:47 I disagree with the age limit.  Could care less about bump stocks.
1133 2018-03-25 15:22:12 But, wait! They have an answer for that. 18th century "well regulated” doesn’t mean well regulated. It means “proficient in their use”. But remember, 18th century “arms” means bump stocks, AR-15s, 50 cals, etc. as an uninfringed right.
1134 2018-03-25 15:21:43 To say that about the NRA and good members is wrong. To say that the NRA needs to stop looking at dollars and looking at common sense approaches is the correct answer. Bump stocks is a start
1135 2018-03-25 15:20:53 Our new website is under construction, will let you know as soon as due date is known. We will be vlogging this afternoon in about 3 1/2 hours about NASDAQ. I have charts on the ten largest stocks in NASDAQ. Bitcoin hanging in above Hyperwave Phase 3.
1136 2018-03-25 15:20:33 Marco Rubio wants to play both sides of the fence. He drinks of the NRA's coolaid. Last month he was defending bump stocks.Rubio must think we will forget the shit he has spouted! This is the real world we need real people in office! Not fork tongue snakes!
1137 2018-03-25 15:20:20 Where was this outrage when Obama expanded gun rights? Twice! He legalized bump stocks and allowed guns in some state parks and on Amtrak.  But when T is in office it’s s national emergency.
1138 2018-03-25 15:20:01 Do you want to read the NRA statement about bump stocks and how they were edger to have them banned. Also do some research on the 1934 NFA backed by NRA
1139 2018-03-25 15:19:57 I’m still waiting for you to rebuke your hero trump for supporting raising the ages and eliminating bump stocks... crickets are louder...
1140 2018-03-25 15:18:16 Of course I'm all for stricter background checks and never cared about bump stocks anyway I just defend the right to protect my family there's nothing wrong with owning a rifle as long as you are legally allowed to do so I plan to own my own land one day a pistol won't cut it
1141 2018-03-25 15:17:49 easy low cost access to bump stocks are fairly new
1142 2018-03-25 15:17:28 @CoryBooker Here May be a unique idea.  Have the American voter decide whether to amend the 2nd Amendment or not to ban bump stocks and assault weapons!  Congress can’t or won’t act.  Put it on this year’s midterm
1143 2018-03-25 15:17:16 People who claim "2nd Amendment" act as if the constitution is perfect. Founders got plenty of things wrong (hence the 27 amendments). They also didn't think anything past a musket would come out, much less AR15/high capacity magazines/bump stocks, etc.
1144 2018-03-25 15:17:14 Could we put gun stocks in that category?

$AOBC $RGR
1145 2018-03-25 15:16:23 I know this is hard to believe...but you can be a conservative and still think AR15s and bump stocks should be regulated.   Mind blowing I know
1146 2018-03-25 15:16:06 @GoldDoubleEagle Warren Buffett and Philip Fisher are outstanding to study from. "Common Stocks & Uncommon Profits" is a must read!
1147 2018-03-25 15:15:21 Maybe higher ethanol blending targets, which are adhered to by OMCs, can save sugar stocks from plunging further.
1148 2018-03-25 15:15:13 I think you need to be more level headed about this issue. CNN are definitely on the side of liberals but that’s another issue. I think most people would be happy with a ban on AR-15’s, bump stocks and universal background checks for all guns purchases. That’s just common sense
1149 2018-03-25 15:15:03 You have an A+.
NRA is all about power and money. They're lashing out because they are scared someone's going to take away their toys. We don't need military style weapons, high capacity magazines and bump stocks on our streets. There needs to be a change.
1150 2018-03-25 15:14:55 No, the Obama Administration DID NOT LEGALIZE BUMP STOCKS. It fought against them but Congress wouldn't help.
1151 2018-03-25 15:14:22 More lies.   The truth is that the ATF decided Bump Stocks were legal because they weren't guns and didn't have moving parts.  Obama just happened to be POTUS at the time.
1152 2018-03-25 15:13:36 Let PSU banks stocks get hammered to the bottom to make govt realize that it lacks commercial accumen to run a organisation and no investors wants them and it  should only focus on being a regulator
1153 2018-03-25 15:13:24 You won't believe what those millennial humans are up to now. That's why you need to sell Paycom Software $PAYC #Stocks
1154 2018-03-25 15:13:18 More lies.   The truth is that the ATF decided Bump Stocks were legal because they weren't guns and didn't have moving parts.  Obama just happened to be POTUS at the time.
1155 2018-03-25 15:12:21 YouTube won't let people post videos on how to create bump stocks. One more reason for me to keep watching YouTube.
1156 2018-03-25 15:12:07 What more common ground do you want? One side wants their guns. The other side wants common sense legislation that gets assault rifles and bump stocks off the streets. You sound exceedingly creepy when you do the NRA’s bidding.
1157 2018-03-25 15:12:01 The idea that social movements have no agenda is a myth used to discredit them. At the #MarchForOurLives in Newark, ALL speakers mentioned 5 SPECIFIC goals:

1. Universal BR checks
2. Raise purchasing age to 21
3. Ban bump stocks
4. Close gun show loophole
5. Vote

Try listening.
1158 2018-03-25 15:11:46 What action? Most of the rhetoric and partisan BS coming out of this has been restricting gun ownership, bump stocks, and expanding background checks. None of which will stop gun violence! So again, what action are you talking about or is this just more rhetoric and partisan BS?
1159 2018-03-25 15:10:38 Hi Paddy. Try Maxol Muff & Muff Centra. Both stocks 
1160 2018-03-25 15:09:42 Exactly and it isn't light either. You can't bolt on parts to silence it, or add bump stocks or folding stocks to make it easily concealable.
1161 2018-03-25 15:09:24 Mr.President:  Bump stocks are not the problem. Guns are not the problem. Hated is the problem! It seems to be growing.
1162 2018-03-25 15:09:24 Weird, since Republicans have control of both houses and Trump is the one banning bump stocks.  Maybe it's not red or blue that matters, but statists or freedom.  #VoteLibertarian
1163 2018-03-25 15:09:17 Oh and the administration before this one did so much to help? Obama is the one who approved the Bump Stocks.
1164 2018-03-25 15:09:12 at a gun show, you wouldn't have even had to show a driver's license. You could have bought 10, bump stocks, and large capacity magazines--in most states of the union. You could have been a felon, or a convicted spouse beater just released from jail.
1165 2018-03-25 15:09:01 Hey moron. Bump stocks were “allowed” because they didn’t mechanically alter a weapon for automatic fire even though the result was the same. Weasel worded BS.
1166 2018-03-25 15:08:50 Guns are already regulated.  In some states more than others.  And banning bump-stocks or scary looking modular guns or rifles are not going to make people safer.
1167 2018-03-25 15:08:22 I believe it is bump stocks. Though I never heard of them b4 Vegas shooter
1168 2018-03-25 15:08:13 Btc current price is 8571$.price will surge or go down frm resistance level?

1169 2018-03-25 15:07:54 That instance. No one should be able to buy those guns anyway. And don’t give me a second amendment speech and cry. There are already guns that aren’t covered, this will be one of them. Bump stocks too.
1170 2018-03-25 15:07:46 No one is saying 
Take away guns
Saying there is NO reason for bump stocks
No reason an 18yr old needs an automatic weapon- unless they are going to war
No reason that a person wanting to buy a gun can not wait for a background check
We need guns
We just do not need outdated laws
1171 2018-03-25 15:07:33 My stocks/IRA’s/401K are also taking hits because of it too & Im afraid at opening bell tomorrow that the bleeding will continue.
1172 2018-03-25 15:07:12 gold/stocks/bonds and a star of David neckless cuz im all jewish like that lol
1173 2018-03-25 15:06:49 Happening. Trump banned your bump stocks, sunshine. Donald “Tiny Hands Bitch of the NRA” Trump, of all people. 

It’s happening.
1174 2018-03-25 15:06:27 Boy bus stocks must be up!
1175 2018-03-25 15:06:26 However, stocks are in bigger bubble than crypto ever was.
1176 2018-03-25 15:05:56 pqp o stocks fez 4 pontos só aaaaaaa assim n dá tô.nervosa
1177 2018-03-25 15:05:16 Il veulent pas la remettre en stocks orh 
1178 2018-03-25 15:05:11 I only understand stocks when it's about nerdy shit.
1179 2018-03-25 15:05:08 Look. They want a plan by the government to keep them safe.They are talking about outlawing AR 15's, extended magazines, bump stocks and the like. These kids did a great job. We need to vote these politicians out of office who want to take NRA money.
1180 2018-03-25 15:05:04 @KeithRothfus WE MUST SEE YOU VOTING for gun limits NOW!!  DON'T CHOSE GUNS OVER THE CHILDREN OF THIS WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA AREA.  BAN Automatic weapons and Bump Stocks NOW.   WHERE IS MENTAL HEALTH COVERAGE FOR ALL OF OUR CHILDREN IN PA?
1181 2018-03-25 15:04:33 Travelling Without Movingも802終わるん
1182 2018-03-25 15:04:11 Keep defending your A+ rating so it will be easy to vote you out!   No one wants a gun ban you idiot! Turn off NRA TV for Christ sake! COMMON SENSE GUN REFORM! No military type weapons in civilized society, no bump stocks.
1183 2018-03-25 15:03:30 Bump stocks for rock buckets?
1184 2018-03-25 15:03:24 So we’re going to “effectively ban” bump stocks by criminalizing possession?

But that won’t do anything; bad people who want bump stocks will still find a way to get them.

1186 2018-03-25 15:02:54 NO TO REPEAL THE 2ND AMENDMENT!!!"A WELL REGULATED MILITIA"THE REQUEST IS FOR ASSAULT WEAPONS & BUMP STOCKS FROM BEING SOLD. Age limit TO 21 Universal background Checks IS AN ASSAULT RIFLE WORTH EVEN 1 LIFE? CHILD OR ADULT THEIR SMILE LAUGHTER LOVE FAMILY FRIENDS
IS IT?
1187 2018-03-25 15:02:45 I love gun nuts were raging on her stating that it was illegal for her to cut down the barrel but they’re okay with bump stocks and other gun hacks.
1188 2018-03-25 15:02:24 I am not under the illusion that the government is coming for my guns, I do think they are going to limit the guns I'm able to buy , it's kinda stupid , because people are scared of guns that don't have wood stocks
1189 2018-03-25 15:01:47 remember that guy that said "rising interest rates are good for the financials"? - I just looked through a ton of bank stocks and it ain't pretty
1190 2018-03-25 15:01:09 I don’t care about bump stocks.  All semantics.
1191 2018-03-25 15:00:47 That’s not what I’m saying. I have no problem with enhanced background checks and banning bump stocks But the way people are talking that’s going to solve all the problems. There’s a huge mental health aspect to this which is not being addressed
1192 2018-03-25 15:00:18 methods require practice, certainly moreso than a bump stock.

So, the benefit of bump stocks is they make bump firing easier.

I cannot make this any clearer.
1193 2018-03-25 14:59:50 You realize Bump Stocks are not actually a gun, right? It’s an “accessory” that doesn’t need to be. How is that unconstitutional? I’ll wait for your genius reply.
1194 2018-03-25 14:59:30 But, best strategy might be what Livermore said..."Then get out of all your stocks; get out for keeps! Wait until  you see-or until you think you see the turn of the market....This Might be where we are at the moment...though hardest to do so
1195 2018-03-25 14:57:04 So are you saying the 2nd amendment was written by Hollywood? Semi-automatics, high capacity magazines and bump stocks were around in the late 18th century? OK...
1196 2018-03-25 14:56:23 The reforms they claim to want would do almost nothing to save black victims of gun violence. Not too many bump stocks used in shootings in Chicago.
1197 2018-03-25 14:55:57 That’s a lie. Blame Obama all you want but everyone knows that you and your party have taken million of dollars from the NRA. There is blood on your hands. BTW bump stocks aren’t this issue here fool....we need sensible gun laws.
1198 2018-03-25 14:55:44 What the #MarchForOurLives is for:
- Our lives (right in the name!)
- A ban on AR-15s and bump stocks
- Every teacher and student's right to work/learn in a gun-free zone
- Thorough background checks in every state
- Gun licenses being as strongly managed as drivers licenses
1199 2018-03-25 14:55:43 stocks are deeply oversold on a short-term basis as measured by the percent of issues above their own 20-day moving average
1200 2018-03-25 14:55:42 With all the law suits hitting facebook and the facebook stocks dropping like they are the owners and operators of Facebook are most likely not going to be able to keep going and with the huge amounts of boycotts against Facebook time is running out for their site
1201 2018-03-25 14:55:39 Bump stocks I agree either ban them or regulate them in the same way fully automatic weapons are. But if you think banning the AR15 will stop a high body count then you're a fool.
1202 2018-03-25 14:55:38 LOL. You are totally out of you mind. You think all this time they've been itching to "tyranny" you and have not merely because of your stupid bump stocks? All of history happened because you have an AR-15 and a few rounds? Don't know where to even start, that's so blockheaded.
1203 2018-03-25 14:54:51 The perfect indulgence 2,500 kcal worth ! 
The original - Solid Egg - limited stocks - perfect Easter present for loved ones (or even yourself !)
1204 2018-03-25 14:53:42 Some gun regulation is needed. Its not all or nothing situation. We can do more background checks, raise age to 21, have 3 day waiting period, eliminate bump stocks..I am a law abiding citizen. If I decide to buy a gun, I want to be to to. But I agree there should be regulations
1205 2018-03-25 14:53:25 Trump agrees with raising the age and eliminating bump stocks.. criticize him for it!!! All I’ve heard were crickets.
1206 2018-03-25 14:52:10 Dude, which is it? Obama was either "comin' for your guns" or his administration "legalized bump stocks"....can't have it both ways. Did you recently fire the person who kept your gas lighting stories sorted? Because you suck at this. Moron.
1207 2018-03-25 14:52:00 Uh no. The ATF concluded they continue the ban bump stocks because they had no moving parts, thus they didn't meet the required legal definition.

Keep reading your Civics for Dummies book.  The part where the President isn't responsible for everything is eye opening!
1208 2018-03-25 14:51:36 Better investment than stocks soooooooo Buy!!
1209 2018-03-25 14:50:52 El punto que señalas él lo compensa con una reducción del encaje en PF. No comparto la propuesta. El análisis de los efectos sobre los bancos es un poco superficial. Además, hay un tema de stocks y flujos que no queda claro.
1210 2018-03-25 14:50:13 Actually he tweeted to them and banned bump stocks, but anyone with half a brain can see parkland was false flag. Cognitive dissonance again
1211 2018-03-25 14:48:26 Nilesh , isn't this going to drive down the returns of MF ? So much money chaisng same stocks ? isnt  it better to avoid MF and go for ETF now ?
1212 2018-03-25 14:48:25 It’s not “many” who support a ban of assault weapons and bump stocks — it’s the MAJORITY. Start representing your constituents NOW. #GunControlNow #FLvoter #MarchForOurLives #NeverAgain
1213 2018-03-25 14:48:08 All Presidents have Secret Service protection, dummy. For bump stocks, ATF issued independent ruling. Didn't come from WH. Haven't seen Trump sign anything. Post a link to any approved bill please.
1214 2018-03-25 14:47:35 Why not ban automatic weapons, high capacity magazines, ammo, bump stocks. I’m not against people owning guns but their isn’t any reason to own a military type weapon, you certainly aren’t going to hunt with it.
1215 2018-03-25 14:47:04 @NRA @GOP own your shame get your head out of the sand and do the right thing. Ban bump stocks, raise the age limit to owning weapons and ban assault rifles
1216 2018-03-25 14:46:53 Only Modi remaining 3 are laughter stocks
1217 2018-03-25 14:46:48 You made a claim about bump stocks. Back it up. My need has nothing to do with it and YOU certainly don't get to define my needs or wants. 

How does a bump stock change the rate of fire of any gun?

If you want to ban something you should know what that thing does.
1218 2018-03-25 14:45:53 Obama was a fool.  "Thank you Obama for legalizing Bump Stocks" said Steven Pollock.
1219 2018-03-25 14:45:42 There is a "ban" being pushed, but it is solely for war rifles, machine guns, AR-15's & their ilk.  The kind that has only one purpose & that is to kill PEOPLE.  Those we want banned from civil society, including accessories like the bump stocks, & large magazines. @marcorubio
1220 2018-03-25 14:45:18 Your fragile ego is almost fascinating. 6:40 in the morning and your ready to tell the world you’re great at social media and oh yeah, Hilary lost. Are there no bigger issues? The trade war you started? Stocks falling? Kids being killed? You lack substance.
1221 2018-03-25 14:45:18 For my lil sis bday this year, I giving her some stocks or making sure she buy her own. Gotta pay it forward and keep lil homie focus... #GrownIsh
1222 2018-03-25 14:45:04 What #Cuckservatives don't understand is that

1. The nice leftist down the street is NOT "just their friendly neighbor with whom they disagree with."
2. Instead of considering banning bump stocks, they should be passing laws making it legal to own fully automatic weapons.
1223 2018-03-25 14:44:33 In 2010 the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives determined that because bump stocks don't have any moving parts, they are a "firearm part" and could not be regulated as a firearm under existing gun laws. The ATF reached a similar conclusion in 2012.
1224 2018-03-25 14:44:11 No, it isn’t.  The point: when automatic weapons were recognized as being detrimental to the general welfare and domestic tranquillity of the people, they were made illegal. Times change, and now military-style weapons, bump stocks, and large mags need to be regulated.
1225 2018-03-25 14:43:46 You are right! It isn’t going anywhere. But, semi automatics and bump stocks are.
1226 2018-03-25 14:43:38 What happened to all those unaccounted for stocks of mustard gas?
1227 2018-03-25 14:43:22 I agree with the ban in bump stocks but it's the first step down the slippery slope. What if next shooting (God forbid) is done by a shotgun. The outcry will be to ban shotguns. That WILL happen.

1232 2018-03-25 14:39:51 This coming from the man who made Bump Stocks legal.
1233 2018-03-25 14:39:31 So, the best I can tell kids do not want to be shot down in cold blood at school. Therefore, they want bump stocks banned, real background checks, a real waiting period, no AR-15s and no guns sold to mentally ill and domestic abusers. They ARE protesting FOR something. #NRAidiots
1234 2018-03-25 14:39:03 Tell me why it is SO difficult to understand that NO ONE IS SAYING BAN ALL GUNS!!!! The movement wants to ban all assault style guns: all multiple magazines: raise the legal purchase age to 21: ban bump stocks:halt sales online and at gun shows.
1235 2018-03-25 14:37:57 If you care sooooooo much, why were things like bump stocks even available to purchase after your 8 years?..
1236 2018-03-25 14:37:34 Time to cancel that law..... watch how quickly assault weapons disappear... Imagine if the 50 dead in Las Vegas and other shootings were able to sue the manufacturers (and of the bump stocks)!!!
1237 2018-03-25 14:37:29 Check your facts, be independent,open minded & make your own assessment of the issues. Bump stocks ban is now law
1238 2018-03-25 14:37:22 The man ahead of the agenda to take away our guns .legalized bump stocks ?
1239 2018-03-25 14:36:48 Absolutely spot on from JP. The EU quota system actually saved the UK fishing industry, following the collapse of stocks from overfishing.
1240 2018-03-25 14:36:31 He can’t ban bump stocks without Congress’s approval.
1241 2018-03-25 14:36:17 You campaigned on making those changes... Had 8 years to do it.. Can't blame congress, Trump just banned bump stocks by himself
1242 2018-03-25 14:36:03 *NEW OFFER* 

There are some bottles of Blind Pig Cider (flavoured with bourbon and blueberry) in the fridge that we need shot of so each bottle is £1 only while stocks last. 

Any requests for new drinks in the fridge? You'll have to help us empty the fridges first though!
1243 2018-03-25 14:35:33 So yu must be talking about dems since they were in power the last 8 years and did nothing but legalize bump stocks !!! They had mass shootings and did nothing !!! They are the ones owned by your so called gun companies !!!!
1244 2018-03-25 14:35:32 Says Barack Obama who approved the sale of bump stocks! You hypocrite! Why didn't you change gun laws after all the shootings that happened under your watch?
1245 2018-03-25 14:34:59 Hope indeed  .A national display like this will get attention. We need to keep pressure on the NRA as it has become the rally point for gun nuts , having long ago lost its legitimacy as a representative for sane gun owners.The ban on bump stocks is a start , next large magazines
1246 2018-03-25 14:34:54 Yet your administration was the one that legalized bump stocks....
1247 2018-03-25 14:33:57 Bills are introduced and then debated and changed. Age to 21, background checks, waiting period, most important is the ban on assault weapons, AR15, bump stocks. Most people want guns for protection and sport. Again listen
1248 2018-03-25 14:33:41 Thank you President Trump for supporting a band on bump stocks and the STOP School Violence Act. 
1249 2018-03-25 14:33:08 Not God given. What are AR15s use other than kill as many people as possible. Why do we need bump stocks? If you are not mentally ill, criminal or an abuser, you can have your guns. Just not semi-automatic killing machines. Do you have a problem with that?
1250 2018-03-25 14:32:37 Yet it is incredibly easy to convert a semi automatic ar 15 to automatic with bump stocks (which are legal). Why are you being so hostile, I want to have an open discussion to be able to save more lives as opposed to “spewing” from our asses while more children die.
1251 2018-03-25 14:32:24 ...at 65p more than Sainsbury’s used to sell it! You can find it in discount stores while stocks last. Bought 16 yesterday and cleared the shelf of our local ‘Savers’ #willkeepmegoing

And although I don’t believe that definite legislative solutions are clear to anyone Things such as waiting periods, extended background checks, and bans on accessories like bump stocks and high capacity magazines are something we can all agree on
1259 2018-03-25 14:29:51 #MarchForOurLives ~ there no good reason for automatic / semiautomatic weapons / bump stocks / armour piercing rounds / extended clips ~ wake up and #MakeAmericaSaferAgain ! #Trump #NRA #Despicables #Republican #FoxNews #Parkland #ProtectOurYouthTheyAreTheFuture
1260 2018-03-25 14:29:06 Not one member of the NRA caused any mass shootings, however  A member OF the NRA STOPPED A shooter in Massachusetts...... crickets
1261 2018-03-25 14:28:36 The 'law' doesn't ban bump stocks only, it bans any rate of fire increase. Got a competition trigger? I do. A light 2ib trigger for precision shooting? I do. DC is full of lawyers they don't write closed end laws because it would put them out of business. READ the law ffs
1262 2018-03-25 14:26:57 I would like to see single-line-item legislation for gun control issues: magazine size, bump stocks, background check data, military-style semis, mental health issues, etc. #LETTHEMVOTE
1263 2018-03-25 14:26:22 The evaluation of the consensus is crucial to me as well. I think if the consensus goes on being wrong for year after year after year (eg stocks are going to fall because Shiller CAPEs are high) then aggressive long-term positions are justified.
1264 2018-03-25 14:26:17 Wondering If This Ideal Of The Bump Stocks Were Every Used In Past Violent Crims Involving Mass Shooting Crimes, Surly There Is A Lot Of Hoopla  Sourounding Resent Events Of Said. Never The Less My Curiosity  Compels Me To Pounder Thease Very Questions.
1265 2018-03-25 14:25:59 Message yesterday....“If you give us an inch with bump stocks we’ll take a mile”...says it all. It will never be enough. The protest was billed as a school safety march, but it was a gun control march.
1266 2018-03-25 14:25:59 Bump stocks are illegal in MA and they're well on their way to being banned elsewhere too.

And yes. Mass murders are deterred by the time commitment! That's literally why there are waiting periods.

If you're in favor of banning all semi automatic weapons just say so.
1267 2018-03-25 14:25:49 This is what you come up with?! Hahaha, yeah, shit is easy...so easy Ohio State can do it . C’mon Stocks, lay off the peanut butter and jealous

1272 2018-03-25 14:24:43 I Marched yesterday in Dayton Ohio as millions did across USA.  I just told some on twitter attacking you that at least you said you supported us marching & you are banning bump stocks & stronger background checks. I said if we make this more political BS, we fix nothing for Kids
1273 2018-03-25 14:24:30 まさに
1274 2018-03-25 14:24:22 Fuck those guys . ‘Equity for punks’ as well. It’s fucking stocks and shares you goons.
1275 2018-03-25 14:24:21 What the heck are you rambling about? I don’t see the need for bump stocks or “machine guns”. AR-15’s are not Machine Guns. I have semi-automatic’s. NOT the same as a machine gun.
1276 2018-03-25 14:23:52 NRATV is a bad forum. I didn't learn where Killer Mike stands on guns. I was looking for his current policy stances on bump stocks, >30 rd magazine, laws w/violent people having guns etc before what left and right are doing w/other issues.
1277 2018-03-25 14:23:42 It’s worth pointing out that she’s flaunting something that no one wants to take away.  She’s not showing waiting periods, background checks, bump stocks, limited magazines, assault weapons or gun show purchases, only making a sleazy joke out of something people care about.
1278 2018-03-25 14:23:25 I wonder how many went short(warrant etc)  of fb stocks near $200 and gonna make a killing now
1279 2018-03-25 14:23:17 You mean between using a bump stock and manually bump firing? Bump stocks obviously make it easier. If they improve accuracy, I don’t know. Any kind of bump firing is very inaccurate.
1280 2018-03-25 14:23:06 Did any of the shooters use bump stocks? Or automatic weapons?
Also, did authorities take people's cell phones up? And erase pics/vids? Or was that not proven?
1281 2018-03-25 14:23:06 Bump stocks are completely legal. And I don't think mass murderers are deterred by the time commitment. Why do you want them to have these guns that are so unrealistic for both hunting and home protection at the risk of my students?
1282 2018-03-25 14:22:44 Im a big believer in momentum and pattern recognition. But it’s a huge leap to say what works in stocks will work in crypto (far more volatility). These things need to be tested, statistically. Also not a fan of arbitrary horizons, such as candles
1283 2018-03-25 14:22:43 naw my mom got major stocks wit them, so they gave her companion passes but I’m tryna work for them tho 
1284 2018-03-25 14:22:39 While at the #MarchForOurLives we met a nice Syracuse college student from England. He said they changed their gun laws after a mass shooting some years ago and their problem now is knives, not mass gun shootings. Ban assault weapons, bump stocks and big mags. And VOTE!
1285 2018-03-25 14:22:39 Surement pour avoir plus de stocks de bananes/poudres/autres ?
1286 2018-03-25 14:22:13 They've turned this into bashing @POTUS, meanwhile back at the ranch it was Obama who legalized bump stocks&in reality @potus will be doing much more on gun control than Obama/Democrats..which possibly will lose him base support,but that's why we love Trump,he's not a politician!
1287 2018-03-25 14:22:10 Liberals blame Trump for all the mass shootings while being President for 400+ days when the other President served an 8 year term and did NOTHING.  Trump is at least trying to push out the bump stocks on guns.
1288 2018-03-25 14:21:57 Trump has banned bump stocks, pushed for expanded background checks.  Meanwhile, the local sheriffs department and the FBI failed to protect these kids, but somehow this is Trump’s fault.   Ummm.......okay!
1289 2018-03-25 14:21:54 Here’s some common ground - #CommonSenseGunLaws; age 21 to purchase, ban assault rifles, ban large capacity clips, ban armor piercing bullets, ban bump stocks.
1290 2018-03-25 14:21:33 A lot of people blasting the kids who protested. It’s their right as Americans to protest. I’m a gun owner but I see where they are coming from. They just want a dialogue- the NRA plans to sue over bump stocks and won’t give an inch that attitude causes this
1291 2018-03-25 14:21:13 Most ppl want gun law reform. Most ppl support banning bump stocks, ban on AR 15s or military style guns, and reinstating mental checks that Trump wrote an EO to get rid of the rule

I'm a recently proclaimed independent that was a Republican till 2015-2016. And we r gun owners 2
1292 2018-03-25 14:20:14 There IS another way without legislation to help control these weapons. The MANUFACTURERS and RETAILERS can stop offering / making / selling semi-automatic, large caliber, high muzzle-velocity weapons. They can stop making /selling bump stocks and hi capacity magazines.
1293 2018-03-25 14:20:05 Are you so naive to think they’ll stop with the AR-15?  This has nothing to do with assault rifles, high capacity magazines, or bump stocks.  They want a total ban.  Don’t give them an inch.
1294 2018-03-25 14:19:49 High powered guns and large magazines. If the shooter in MD had a high powered gun many more would have died. Honestly it’s not that hard increase background checks, raise buying age, eliminate bump stocks, make it harder to buy auto weapons and do not permit large ammo mags.
1295 2018-03-25 14:19:47 On another note sir. Banning bump stocks and other firearm accesaries will have absolutely no impact on gun violence. Simply put your triggerfinger hand thumb through your belt loop and pull trigger. You Will see it fires automatically
1296 2018-03-25 14:19:45 Infringing on the 2A is and always will be difficult.  Reclassification of bump stocks to class 2 devices with class 2 restrictions is easier but will have a legal battle.  Restricting semi automatic rifles is a non-starter.  Just because a rifle is black doesn’t make it an AW
1297 2018-03-25 14:19:18 I agree exactly. Companies are still making record profits. This is just a gift if you pick the correct stocks and have big picture guide to help. The bounce will be amazing just like 1 month ago.
1298 2018-03-25 14:18:26 While #MarchForOurLives was taking place yesterday, a law was passed in #Virginia to allow bump stocks allowing multiple bullets to be fired in quick succession. #NRA #GunControl #trump
1299 2018-03-25 14:17:40 You got it. Be sure to thank Trump since he's the one that banned bump stocks. And remember we asked Obama to do that after the California shooting.
1300 2018-03-25 14:17:26 I see no reason for the use of bump stocks for average Americans- Military maybe- I’ll wait to hear one.....
1301 2018-03-25 14:17:14 Thank you, Mayor! Let’s get to work on eliminating semiautomatics, large magazines, and bump stocks. Let’s get universal background checks in place. #NeverAgain #MarchForOurLives
1302 2018-03-25 14:16:45 NO TO REPEAL THE 2ND AMENDMENT!!!"A WELL REGULATED MILITIA"THE REQUEST IS FOR ASSAULT WEAPONS & BUMP STOCKS FROM BEING SOLD. Age limit TO 21 Universal background Checks IS AN ASSAULT RIFLE WORTH EVEN 1 LIFE? CHILD OR ADULT THEIR SMILE LAUGHTER LOVE FAMILY FRIENDS

1307 2018-03-25 14:15:34 Time is an investment... stop investing in stocks that ain't worth shyt.... ppl are stocks in this statement if you missed it
1308 2018-03-25 14:15:18 I am ok with banning bump stocks and a better background checks.. But I maybe wrong but I don't think that the Chicago gang bangers don't respect the guns laws
1309 2018-03-25 14:15:17 This is what this is all about. This doesnt stop at one thing, just at bump stocks or magazine size or "assault weapons". They will keep going and keep taking away
1310 2018-03-25 14:14:37 I know you only look at a few selected stocks to trade and that watch list changes monthly.  How do you analyze and select those stocks to watch and trade on a monthly basis? For example BATMAN of BATMANING, etc.
1311 2018-03-25 14:14:36 I don’t personally care about bump stocks but this is the reason I didn’t want them outlawed.

1313 2018-03-25 14:12:45 Obama has ARMED SECURITY for life(who pays for it) Obama administration approved sale of bump fire stocks on at least 2 occasions. Blame @POTUS but he will be the one signing Stop School Violence, Banning Bump Stocks, and other measures for school safety. #MAGA #MarchForLife
1314 2018-03-25 14:12:31 What new gun laws are being proposed? The ban of bump stocks that were legalized by Obama? Trump has already repeatedly said he is moving to eliminate those. What else?
1315 2018-03-25 14:12:18 A 3 month C&H doesn't mean much of anything and can be seen in most stocks. It truly never results in anything.
1316 2018-03-25 14:11:19 Bump stocks use the kinetic force of a gun and increase its firing capability. High capacity magazines allow for more bullets to be shot without reloading.

1318 2018-03-25 14:09:43 Did u know President Trump banned bump stocks? I am pretty sure they were legalized during  Obama.

1321 2018-03-25 14:07:21 So glad there are people to call out his lies. And like bump stocks are the problem anyway. Ordinary citizens do not need semi automatic weapons. They are the problem. #Bumpstocks
1322 2018-03-25 14:07:12 #NRA lies! Gun control laws are to protect everyone! You don’t need an assault weapon i.e. AR15 or bump stocks to protect your home & family, unless you’re a terrorist or criminal. Age 21, background cks, assault weapons!
1323 2018-03-25 14:06:19 Owning assault weapons and bump stocks is not a right...we all have a right to a safer country, and the majority are speaking up!

1326 2018-03-25 14:04:48 Where is this ban on bump stocks? I see a proposal by the Justice Department, but nothing approved. And do you propose buying back  already owned bump stocks and other legal devices that convert semi-automatic weapons into automatic? You need to do more!

1328 2018-03-25 14:03:12 In fairness, & generally speaking,, I have to wonder if those complaining about the ban on bump stocks would even have the spine TO USE THEM, if we ever needed it. I worry that they will just stay 'keyboard warriors' and NOT really fight when the time is right.

1331 2018-03-25 14:02:10 We should absolutely push for a ban on semiautomatic weapons and repossess the ones already on the streets, just like every other civilized country in the world. The Left makes a mistake focusing on background checks and bump stocks in a futile effort to compromise with gun nuts.
1332 2018-03-25 14:02:10 As President for 8 years you did nothing to make change to gun control. You actually allowed bump stocks to become legal. How about you shut your pie hole. Your only talking about it now because you can’t do anything about it and smart people know that
1333 2018-03-25 14:02:09 bump-stocks ? I’m not familiar with bump stocks so I can’t give you an answer for that but that’s what you might be talking about.
1334 2018-03-25 14:01:53 We know that he bought a huge arsenal in the past year. Why isn't that kind of activity red flagged by the FBI? We also know he bought bump stocks. Since then, the Texas company that makes them has had website outages and inventory problems because there's been a run on them.

1336 2018-03-25 14:01:32 Correction to your tweet: it’s NOT a ‘gun ban’! It’s #GunReform #guncontrol - it’s NOT an infringement of 2ndA because when written there was no such thing as bump stocks or assault weapons. Stop the manipulation, propaganda & lies. Get on board or you’ll be voted out!
1337 2018-03-25 14:01:12 1-Ban semi-auto guns that fire high-velocity rounds
2-Ban bump stocks and other accessories that simulate auto weapons
3-Create a database for gun sales & universal background checks
4-Raise the legal age to guns to 21

1338 2018-03-25 14:01:02 Yesterday I heard kids say that "give us an inch and we will take a mile" regarding bump stocks and firearms. I personally do not bump stock should be legal but if they make statements like that nothing will get done. Go back to Tide Pods kiddies
1339 2018-03-25 14:00:34 @realDonaldTrump You’re abandoning your base. This isn’t about bump stocks. It’s about gun control. You will lose Congress in November and you reelection bid in 2020. Why? Because you’re now the leader of the swamp.

1343 2018-03-25 13:59:12 Ban bump stocks, stiff penalties for use or any other device that creates rapid shooting.
1344 2018-03-25 13:59:09 Tomi... who is proposing we disarm Americans? No one is proposing to take away the right to bear arms.  They want better oversight, better background checks, stopping bump stocks and possible solutions to protecting schools better.
1345 2018-03-25 13:58:49 Love this tweet!

I've had so many people gunsplaining to me what AR stands for and what bump stocks are etc etc. The only thing they can't explain is their own stupidity. I don't CARE what it stands for. Just ban the fucker.
1346 2018-03-25 13:58:17 These groups speak on the side of good & common sense. No greed here, we are simply trying to ban bump stocks, high capacity mags, military type assault weapons to the general public. We need a 30-day window for COMPLETE background checks & 21 yo age limit. No ban-just good sense
1347 2018-03-25 13:57:10 About to put people on to investing in stocks, one of the best decisions I’ve made
1348 2018-03-25 13:57:00 $NVUS & $BKYI holding small position each - imo, @ash_trader did good dd(s) on those ~ both are very quiet stocks (until news hit )
1349 2018-03-25 13:56:50 1-Ban semi-auto guns that fire high-velocity rounds
2-Ban bump stocks and other accessories that simulate auto weapons
3-Create a database for gun sales & universal background checks

1350 2018-03-25 13:56:41 It’s kind of like how all the former Facebook employees who are as guilty as zuckerberg for messing with user privacy for their profit are suddenly coming out to criticize Facebook to get attention for their current businesses, now that their stocks have all vested.
1351 2018-03-25 13:56:11 IF U banned assault rifles & bump stocks, U also have 2 ensure EVERY1 owning 2 gives em up, & monitor future acquiring from other nations, or home-made adaptations! & what if R govt ever became tyrannical, decades from now? How would the ppl fight off illegal rulers? #Food4Thot
1352 2018-03-25 13:56:05 Jeff Sessions banned bump stocks, but that doesn't matter.

"Common sense" gun laws isn't their true intent.

Give an inch, they'll take 1,000 miles.

1358 2018-03-25 13:52:59 I, personally have no use for bump stocks.  They're a novelty. The same effect can be had with use of a shoestring or your finger. 

Enacting a ban is a pointless exercise in "feel good legislation" and THAT is what I oppose. It emboldens those who would wish further limitations.
1359 2018-03-25 13:52:52 Though let it be noted, this is most likely their conservative base. And even THEY'RE saying "do something". Also, limit magazine capacity, ban bump stocks, ban violent offenders (esp. domestic abusers) from buying guns of any kind. You'll spot the difference in less than 5 years
1360 2018-03-25 13:52:31 They ARE  trying to take guns away! And @POTUS is just standing there  He Bans Bump Stocks with a strike of the pen. #nationalreciprocity  , like he promised during his campaign? NOTHING! Just like the rest. Lies.
1361 2018-03-25 13:52:31 It’s about more than bump stocks... If you do not hear the wisdom of our children: a song played to the beat of peace, love, and revolution, then you simply are not listening. #NeverAgain #Enough #MarchForOurLives @realDonaldTrump

1364 2018-03-25 13:50:29 Any stocks you’d recommend?
1365 2018-03-25 13:50:26 that's all fine and dandy, why don't you grow some balls and ban bump stocks and increase min. age to 21 by executive order
1366 2018-03-25 13:49:37 And Obama's admin legalized bump stocks.
1367 2018-03-25 13:49:25 I would short the shit out if #Facebook if I was trading stocks. But that's too oldschool for me
1368 2018-03-25 13:49:14 Except they really didn’t specify any specific change so this will result in maybe bump stocks being banned and that’s about it. But they will feel good so there’s that :)
1369 2018-03-25 13:49:10 The Dems will forget about gun and kids just like they forgot about DACA. Trump will ban Obama's bump stocks, tighten background checks then Dems will have to create another national catastrophe.
1370 2018-03-25 13:49:03 Banning Bump stocks on assault type weapons and wanting universal background checks is not gun confiscation.
1371 2018-03-25 13:48:18 So answer me this do you agree with the decision that they are going to be making bump stocks illegal?
1372 2018-03-25 13:48:13 What did OBAMA Do after the school shootings during his watch. He made bump stocks legal. Where were the marches then??
1373 2018-03-25 13:48:10 Sounded clear to me. Guns made for war, the clips, bump stocks, need to go. They don’t want to live in schools with armed guards and teachers. Background checks for everyone. Remove guns from ppl with mental problems, violent past. Common sense solutions.
1374 2018-03-25 13:48:08 Are you incapable of telling the TRUTH about anything?  President Obama didn't legalize bump stocks.
1375 2018-03-25 13:48:07 Porinju, the very nature of markets/index is to rise and fall , nothing new in your statement- it’s valid but generic. But all Stocks need not fall and rise with markets. Many stocks( some in ur PMS) which fell this time will not rise back and that is what causes loss of money.
1376 2018-03-25 13:48:00 While Democrats were marching you have been providing solutions such as a ban on bump stocks, you will get results, Democrats will march for something else without ever giving you the credit you deserve
1377 2018-03-25 13:47:54 The “fanatics” don’t understand the term ‘regulated’. The argument is against ASSAULT WEAPONS AND BUMP STOCKS! The fanatics only hear BAN GUNS! These are the same fanatics against pro choice but it’s ok to gun the children down in school! Can’t wrap my head around that ever!
1378 2018-03-25 13:47:44 1 because a dead intruder cant hurt people 2 bump stocks dont make guns full auto they improve your trigger finger 3 every weapon ever made was made to kill things
1379 2018-03-25 13:47:43 I get it. Although I don't generally like incremental erosion of the Bill of Rights, if there is a point of concession for me, it is here. I have no problem classifying bump stocks as an automatic component, and restricted as such.
1380 2018-03-25 13:47:17 The Children and Parents of school shooting got millions to march, but it is only a start.  At least The President said he supported the marchers and he says he is banning bump stocks and supporting stronger background checks. The journey of a 1000 miles begins with single step.
1381 2018-03-25 13:46:57 Curious what you think about fact that tho some Averages and stocks made it to new highs, the $uvxy didn’t come near(to me) its lows, despite that constant rebalancing acting as depressor. Is this just b/c they changed it from 3x leverage to 2x? Thnx
1382 2018-03-25 13:46:57 I hope not even banning bump stocks {which I consider just an ammo wasting piece of crap}is infringing on gun rights.
1383 2018-03-25 13:46:38 Why did president Obama legalize bump stocks?????????
1384 2018-03-25 13:46:02 This has nothing to do with guns in general. This has to do with the strong belief that ordinary citizens do not need high-capacity magazines, bump stocks, or rifles designed solely for killing other human beings.
1385 2018-03-25 13:45:42 @melinda63312935 The Obama administration approved Bump Stocks.
1386 2018-03-25 13:45:23 But this isn’t stocks or investing in companies with products. Even with stocks you do not rely on past performance to determine the future. But crypto is all speculation. Most of these coins don’t have a product and don’t have a real world use yet. Speculation.
1387 2018-03-25 13:45:22 1) It’s literally called the “March FOR Our Lives;”

2) Marchers are FOR universal background checks, a ban on assault weaponry & bump stocks, and closing the gun show loophole;

3) Being anti-NRA is actually an okay thing to be!
1388 2018-03-25 13:44:08 don't worry I'm 100% sure the stocks wont run out anytime soon haha especially for the pins  
(but if ever I do plan on restocking for a convention here around June so yeah)
1389 2018-03-25 13:43:04 You're almost as big a moron as that idiot in the WH. No what is NEEDED is better regs and yes a BAN on bump stocks and AR-15's. These according to SCOTUS are NOT covered under the 2A
1390 2018-03-25 13:41:41 When the Founders wrote the 2nd Amendment, there were zero high powered assault rifles and bump stocks. Let gun rights activists be allowed to have guns that existed in the 1800's.
1391 2018-03-25 13:41:23 Ms. Love, don’t you see? Bump stocks, and judicial processes… along with expanded background checks should already be on the books.
1392 2018-03-25 13:41:08 I completely agree with banning bump stocks 100%! No reason anyone truly needs that. However, semi-autos like AR-15s, AKs, etc. can only shoot 300 rounds/min if you have an insanely fast trigger finger. Just like handguns, they shoot one bullet per trigger pull. Therefore, ...
1393 2018-03-25 13:41:04 Bro i swear i find fuckin t shirts and micro uzi stocks only for the first 20 rooms i search
1394 2018-03-25 13:40:48 It has to happen!! You’re not looking at the big picture!! Stocks don’t run the country
1395 2018-03-25 13:40:07 Why did president Obama/Hillary legalize bump stocks?????????????
1396 2018-03-25 13:39:40 You say that, but the AG just over stepped it's/his authority and is shoving a B.S. ban down our throats. ATF ruled on bump stocks 3 times I believe, because they were stocking to the law as defined. But AG and POTUS just decide, we'll do what we want. That should scare everyone!
1397 2018-03-25 13:39:28 You know what, I take it back. I dont want to ban semi autos or bump stocks anymore. You shouldn't ban guns. The 2nd amendment shouldn't be infringed. What we should do is nationwide licensing for firearms. Get them in the hands of people that everyone can trust. Simple.
1398 2018-03-25 13:39:25 These kids aren’t going away!!  So the #GOP and people who are supported by NRA should be worried! Again nobody is saying take away people’s guns!! NOBODY needs automatic weapons or bump stocks!  I never had to deal with active shooter training when I was in school!  Think Marco!
1399 2018-03-25 13:39:16 @thecongress TRUM-PEE-PEE CRIMINAL AND DRAFT DODGER IS FOR DOING AWAY WITH BUMP STOCKS OR SO HE SAYS. FIRST: HE ISN'T GOING TO GO AGAINST THE NRA WHO FUNDED HIS ELECTION BY $ 30,000,000. BESIDES, THATS LIKE PUTTING A BAND AID ON A CUT THROAT !! ASSAULT WEAPONS NEED 2 BE BANISHED.

1405 2018-03-25 13:38:04 Giving myself to many stocks to watch at once is not good as you’ll just miss the moves you originally was waiting for!
1406 2018-03-25 13:37:44 @RepCharlieDent Background checks, age limits, licensing, bump stocks, military grade weapons, and military grade ammo are all reasonable restrictions. Mercers gave millions to the NRA, which gave millions to Congress. #GunContolNow #MarchForOurLives #notonemore #NeverAgain

1408 2018-03-25 13:36:28 Good selection of stocks 
1409 2018-03-25 13:36:00 Why does banning bump stocks infringe on people's rights? Citizens can still own guns to protect themselves. @realDonaldTrump is not banning ALL guns just BUMP STOCKS. I don't understand why we, as a country, all can't at least agree on that. This is disheartening.
1410 2018-03-25 13:36:00 Du mal à écouler les stocks ?
1411 2018-03-25 13:35:36 WMD never intended or s/have been legal.  Advocates argue "bombs!"-so bombs make ok?  Bombs illegal & no good guy w/AR w/help against them. "Tyranny" when most massive military in world w/decide.  "Come 4 guns!" w/wt* bump stocks STILL LEGAL post #LasVegas/high c.mags/21/no-fly++
1412 2018-03-25 13:35:04 Wow no stocks used, listen you bragging. The ego 
1413 2018-03-25 13:34:33 Fake news. Obama admin did not legalize bump stocks. The ATF simply could not regulate them. Get your facts straight. Obama played no part in this decision.
1414 2018-03-25 13:34:28 In 2010 the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives  determined that because bump stocks don't have any moving parts, they  are a "firearm part" and could not be regulated as a firearm under  existing gun laws. The ATF reached a similar conclusion in 2012.
1415 2018-03-25 13:34:16 AR-15s with bump stocks and being able to buy dozens of guns within months is the issue
1416 2018-03-25 13:33:23 What soybeans are watching, first is this week’s Planting Intensions and Grain Stocks repot.  Acres are expected in increase, which is obvious, but by how much.  Corn’s rally in Feb has bought some acres back.  Exports are slow, which will be seen in an increase in stocks.
1417 2018-03-25 13:33:08 All most want is a ban on assault rifles and bump stocks.  You people even look like you should be in another country so go..............tired of violence and you changing our culture
1418 2018-03-25 13:32:56 And many people in America do want stronger gun control. I don't support total prohibition of guns in any way. But there's no reason why private citizens should be able to stockpile loads of ammunition and semiautomatic and bump stocks and other mods
1419 2018-03-25 13:32:56 @davidhogg111 doesn’t know what a bump stock is or what it does. Bump stocks are highly inefficient devices that make guns erratically shoot, and have terrible accuracy. I would never put one on my AR cause it would make it an ineffective tool.
1420 2018-03-25 13:32:37 I know when it's near summer when our Mam stocks up on them jubbly Ice Lollys, unreal man
1421 2018-03-25 13:32:20 Bull, Bear, Stocks, Futures, Options, Commodity. Whatever it may be, you need to make money. Otherwise No Use. Simply waste.
1422 2018-03-25 13:32:07 Why does banning bump stocks infringe on people's rights? Citizens can still own guns to protect themselves. @realDonaldTrump is not banning ALL guns just BUMP STOCKS. I don't understand why we, as a country, all can't at least agree on that. This is disheartening.
1423 2018-03-25 13:31:35 Nobody wants to disarm anyone. Banning bump stocks, large capacity magazines, and semiautomatic weapons nationwide in no way infringes upon anyone’s 2nd Amendment rights. Read Justice Scalia’s Heller opinion!
1424 2018-03-25 13:31:03 Yes, an official in the Obama administration approved the sale of bump stocks because the legal definition did not allow him to deny it.  But did the #NRA oppose this?  No, they did not - and a truly responsible organization would have.
1425 2018-03-25 13:30:35 You can own guns and still support background checks, banning bump stocks and AR-15. Tired of the all or nothing rhetoric.
1426 2018-03-25 13:30:22 The parallels between crypto and stocks are financial gold right now. Massive sell orders from Nasdaq and Dow and heavy contracts keeping Bitcoin's price from ballooning. Big people are trying to keep the price down. Still in accumulation phase.
1427 2018-03-25 13:30:16 Need to explain programmatic ads to your Mom? It's like the stock market, except ad impressions are traded instead of stocks.
1428 2018-03-25 13:30:03 Haha forgot that his was on the market! Im looking at 1 next week near you on stocks rd 
1429 2018-03-25 13:30:03 No shit!  It start with bump stocks, and any other weapon modifications. give them an inch and they will take a mile.
1430 2018-03-25 13:30:00 He’s still trying to think of a way to make a claim that they were marching to show support for him. (He will undoubtedly make it about himself. Or blame Obama. Just wait for it... ). “I’m the guy who banned bump-stocks” in 3...2...
1431 2018-03-25 13:29:59 Restrictions on types of ammo as well as accessories, like bump stocks, have also been found to be legal and constitutional. No one is trying to ban all guns.
1432 2018-03-25 13:29:50 Emma Gonzalez, six minutes of silence
For gunman, he killed, in the name of violence
Trump no response but aides, they defend him
Bump stocks, purchase age, protestors say slim
1433 2018-03-25 13:29:38 Maybe ask a student to read you and your staffers the 1st Amendment. Like young Noah, I believe bump stocks should be banned, the minimum age should be raised, and Congress people not already asking should get off their FAs and do something about gun control.
1434 2018-03-25 13:29:19 Why do you attack him? He just banned bump stocks and other things to help this from never happening again. More than any other president in a long time.
1435 2018-03-25 13:28:40 Can't wait to exploit the massive #EDGE I have next week after seeing 500 tweets about how stocks in markets absolutely nothing like today's did after farting in a similar cadence for a couple days.
1436 2018-03-25 13:28:30 Northern European investors are going defensive with high dividend #stocks like #Telecom & #Utilities. Look at Deutsche Telekom, E.ON, Ørsted, Tele2, Telia, Elisa & Telenor. #DAX #OMX #Dividend
1437 2018-03-25 13:27:22 hello! it depends on the stocks after the con!! :(
1438 2018-03-25 13:26:55 hi! we don’t know yet cause so far there are limited stocks but if ever there are remaining banners, then yes :)
1439 2018-03-25 13:26:24 What a load of crock! @marcorubio must be illiterate. You want to twist the facts,do you?Who wants to ban guns? We want gun CONTROL & removal of ASSAULT WEAPONS!And the CDC was told NOT to record shooting deaths!STOP SPREADING YOUR DIVISIVE LIES! Ban assault weapons & bump stocks
1440 2018-03-25 13:25:51 @SillyWillysjoke, looking at each machine, @blubbit_ is correct. At its original intent, cars are meant for transportation not killing. What is the original intent of bump stocks?
1441 2018-03-25 13:25:28 Bump stocks should be banned, not because of rate of fire, but because they are dangerous, as it is easy to lose control of your weapon.

That doesn't mean I am against fully auto weapons, because that is how they are designed to be operated.
1442 2018-03-25 13:24:43 Attention dumbass @GOP @NRA @TomiLahren @FoxNewsSunday et al.....
The #MarchForOurLives movement is not abt dismantlingthe #2A or take ng anybody’s fuckin guns. It’s abt BANNING MILITARY GRADE ASSAULT WEAPONS , high capacity magazines, & shit like bump stocks!
1443 2018-03-25 13:23:12 The major difference is the commercial fish harvesting technologies of the last 50 years which contributed in large measure to the decimation of many world fish stocks!

1 ." I like opinions and learning use 8 /21/50 ema for stocks . Options have always been a weakness and with great successes dumb luck and losses. I follow u carefully and only 1-2 others for
1446 2018-03-25 13:20:52 All these stocks.

Hope these tears turn to laughter in the future
1447 2018-03-25 13:20:44 First of all, this is a lie. Obama’s siding legalize bump stocks.

Second, Trumps obsession with Obama and Hillary are stalker restraining order worthy. Sad how Trump must constantly try to compare himself to the past administration by having to lie. Weak and small minded
1448 2018-03-25 13:20:33 I’m pretty sure that money will go to defense contractors.  What do you think his two sons, Dumb and Dumber, have been swapping their invested money into stocks of?

1451 2018-03-25 13:20:19 . Anna this statement is not true. Educate yourself; don’t allow the false news & opposition party to manipulate your thinking. Search Congressional website for gun laws & read them. Also @realDonaldTrump outlawed  bump stocks. Fla passed gun reform laws. There is much to learn
1452 2018-03-25 13:20:17 It’s a matter of national defense Corp of army engineers builds great big beautiful walls
1453 2018-03-25 13:20:12 @AMarch4OurLives It’s not the guns who kills. It’s the people. The kids should be marching about the root of the problem. March to stop bullying , child abuse, depression in our kids, I totally agree we don’t need bump stocks that can carry tons of ammunition.
1454 2018-03-25 13:19:25 NO!  Obama DID NOT legalize bump stocks like Trump just Tweeted.  The law simply did not allow Obama to prohibit bump stocks.  If congress wanted to regulate them they could have.  President Trump is WRONG! Bump stocks weren't considered an issue until after the Vegas shootings.
1455 2018-03-25 13:19:19 Here’s a crazy idea, keep your bump stocks, ban the assault rifles. If you need that for “hunting” you have no business being a hunter. #MarchForOurLives
1456 2018-03-25 13:18:17 Lol I bought a ton of $Fat in the highs and in lows. I have other stocks to trade. Like maybe short $grat and a few others . Swing oil and some mmj stocks . I am long in $Fat very long . 2 years and counting
1457 2018-03-25 13:17:23 The fact that guns are too easy to get is a huge issue. Mental health is also a issue.Until there’s effective gun reform for semi & fully automatic guns & bump stocks mass shootings will continue. And 45 isn’t going to do anything as long as the NRA is giving  him $$$.
1458 2018-03-25 13:17:09 In all of your tweets of self-righteous boasting & widespread insults, 800,000 people #MarchForOurLives on the Capital and you don't say a single word to recognize them or their cause. It's not just bump stocks that's the issue. Open your eyes & act like a leader.
1459 2018-03-25 13:14:55 Amazing. Please explain to me how universal background checks, raising the age limit for gun purchases and banning bump stocks affects "god-given" rights to own a gun. Broad brush fanatical tirades like yours validates my stance.  Dave, your time in office is limited.
1460 2018-03-25 13:13:02 As I do not believe in the closing loopholes and tighter gun control theory, nor in banning bump stocks, I don’t get your point. He is a criminal, but not for those points. None of us should be promoting any of that, just freedom, 2nd Amendment uninfringed...
1461 2018-03-25 13:11:53 Bump stocks were used in the shooting in Las Vegas and nowhere else. They increase speed at the cost of accuracy and probably do major damage to the AR-15 barrel since it isn't built to be fired at full auto speed or close to it. So if they are banned no legal gun owner will care
1462 2018-03-25 13:11:47 Kaya pala inupload mo na lahat! Hahaha. Pagtutuunan ko talaga ng pansin yan pag nagkavacant ako. Wala na pala akong stocks! 
1463 2018-03-25 13:10:34 depends on the stocks after the con!! :(
1464 2018-03-25 13:09:34 No, AR-15s, like the one used recently in Florida are LEGAL can be bought by an 18 year old.  THAT 
, and bump stocks, are the only gun law changes we are asking for.
1465 2018-03-25 13:09:28 We dont
1466 2018-03-25 13:07:51 Not true. Buying several weapons in quick succession. Buying large amounts of ammunition. Buying bump stocks. All could have been signals. People get flagged for buying too much NyQuil. Guns and ammo much more dangerous.
1467 2018-03-25 13:07:48 Hi San... Could you put up  for 1 or 2 stocks and explain... How it helped you to enter and what price you exited.
1468 2018-03-25 13:07:33 Actually a bump stock isnt a gun. Im pro 2nd. I dont think trump will take guns away but a little apeasement with bump stocks to shut people up wont hurt.
1469 2018-03-25 13:07:18 Awesome speaker-with the time freeze and the ending she sure made her point.  Well done, I sure hope that all this helps change the 2nd amendment. No bump stocks or AR 15's when Constitution was written. Guns shot 1 to 2 bullets per minute. #Resist #DACA #GunControlNow
1470 2018-03-25 13:07:01 Why lie about the bump stocks knowing Obama didn’t legalize them? Oh wait...because everyone on your base will follow suit whether true or not. Got ya.
1471 2018-03-25 13:06:01 Yeah wasn't he the president who told the atf that bump stocks aren't to be regulated ? His hypocrisy knows no bounds
1472 2018-03-25 13:05:19 I remember that part in the Bible.  ...and on the seventh day let there be AR-15s with extended magazines, gat cranks, bump stocks, laser scopes, and loads of Ammo.  Or is that @NRA nonsense to sell more guns for the gun manufacturers?
1473 2018-03-25 13:05:14 You had 8 years and did nothing except legalized bump stocks.
1474 2018-03-25 13:04:53 I can respect that train of thought. It's been clearly stated they are looking for gun reform. Background checks for all firearms being sold regardless of who is selling it, raising the age to purchase firearms to 21, banning bump stocks, examining banning future sales of AK-15's
1475 2018-03-25 13:04:22 He is banning bump stocks. What did Obama do? Nothing!
1476 2018-03-25 13:02:29 "improvements to our background check system, propelling CDC [Centers for Disease Control] studies on gun violence and now, a ban on bump stocks.advocated for taking guns “away from dangerous people.”~ @marcorubio  Well said 
1477 2018-03-25 13:02:28 This is one of the most accurate and level statements
There was also a girl who said they’ll take an inch then take a mile. 
They won’t stop at bump stocks, you know this.
1478 2018-03-25 13:02:00 The message has been sent to him "The Blue Wave" has started and it's on its way... Keep ignoring the gun control protests. Don't worry about bum stocks or the age limit, they're just bandaids on a mortal wound. You should worry about banning the sale of automatic rifles instead.
1479 2018-03-25 13:01:07 In 2010 the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives determined that because bump stocks don't have any moving parts, they R a "firearm part" & could not be regulated as a firearm under existing gun laws. ATF reached a similar conclusion in 2012. Not Obama’s decision
1480 2018-03-25 13:00:47 2017 LAS VEGAS SHOOTER-killed 58, injured over 800. HAD NO HISTORY THAT BROUGHT HIM TO ATTENTION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. Gun control ie better background checks, semi automatics outlawed, eliminate bump stocks,etc will make a difference.Congress & Trump turning down NRA $ will help.
1481 2018-03-25 13:00:28 Bump stocks can be hand made for around $.50. You are ‘throwing them a bone” but not a bone that will save enough lives if any. If we secure school buildings this would better cut these tragedies in half. This way, we don’t affect the 2nd Amendment but we keep our kids safe.
1482 2018-03-25 13:00:20 Only President to respond immediately with broad diverse dialog.  Unfortunately Libtard cabal decided not to participate and support a continued dialog.  Lots of Fake News here. PS Barry’s Bump Stocks are now banned by Forest Gump.
1483 2018-03-25 13:00:09 I like it. I don’t think bump stocks should be in there at all though. Hoping trumpy bans them.
1484 2018-03-25 12:59:32 Angus Buchan's net worth is estimated to be in the range of approximately $1171787362 in 2018, according to the users of vipfaq. The estimated net worth includes stocks, properties, and luxury goods such as yachts and private airplanes. Give all that away and then talk.
1485 2018-03-25 12:58:23 If Congress is not going to ban bump-stocks and military style weapons, the least they could do is require these deadly phallic symbols to be kept in bullet proof condoms.

#March4OurLives #AssaultWeaponsBan
1486 2018-03-25 12:56:07 As always with you, this is a lie. The Obama administration didn't legalize bump stocks. Obama issued EOs creating stricter controls (all of which you rolled back), but could not legally restrict (non mechanical) bump stocks without new laws. Congress refused.
1487 2018-03-25 12:55:30 Saya saya maubusan ng stocks
1488 2018-03-25 12:55:04 Very simple. Stop the sale of these AR15 and similar type weapons. Ban Bump stocks. Require training, licensing, registration, insurance for every gun. You know, like we do for cars. Not too tough
1489 2018-03-25 12:54:19 Legit question for anti-gun control peeps. Do you say no to all of these: universal background checks, raised min age to purchase, banning sales to people w mental illness or hist of domestic violence, banning sale of bump stocks? or is there a compromise you are willing take?
1490 2018-03-25 12:54:07 1-Ban semi-auto guns that fire high-velocity rounds
2-Ban bump stocks and other accessories that simulate auto weapons
3-Create a database for gun sales & universal background checks
4-Raise the legal age to guns to 21
5-Close gun show loophole and loophole for 2nd-hand gun sales
1491 2018-03-25 12:52:27 Not at all. Because we allow idiots to own AR-15s and bump stocks. Bullet proof vests a necessary when you go to concerts and nightclubs these days. You're delusional if you think you can protect yourself from an AR-15. #DomesticArmsRace
1492 2018-03-25 12:51:10 "The main thing people feared at that time  was Saddam Hussein's chemical weapons stocks," Bolton said in 2009,  defending the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
1493 2018-03-25 12:49:50 How does stricter background checks, waiting periods, the banning of bump stocks & assault weapons strengthen criminals? Total nonsense 
1494 2018-03-25 12:49:15 No,  Obama did not legalize bump stocks. It makes me sad that all you have to do is say something and cult 45 eats it up without question. Lie lie lie...i can't wait till they all see through your shit
1495 2018-03-25 12:48:01 Testing out new hotkey set up next week... #tradeanywhere #stocks #pennystocks
1496 2018-03-25 12:47:34 The Obama Admin did not "approve" bump stocks, you twit. In 2010 ATF concluded that the law gave them NO AUTHORITY to regulate them. That's not the same as 'approving'. Dems have tried to  ban them several times but were stopped thanks to NRA and Republican opposition.
1497 2018-03-25 12:47:30 It works for Australia and just about any other country in the damn world except for America. No one is trying to ban all guns...that was never the issue! We all respect your second amendment but we ARE trying to ban assault weapons and bump stocks cause that shit is not needed
1498 2018-03-25 12:46:17 Stocks have tanked
1499 2018-03-25 12:45:54 12%? Most hedge fund managers did (post taxcut/massive raise/bonuses) & POTUS appointees, by way of new policy for inside trading their stocks, fam vacations+, using Military jets, kickbacks/hiring cronies/no-bid contracts. Billionaires got many folks 12%+-permanently-allowed all
1500 2018-03-25 12:45:47 @FOX59 I just have to know how you can quote the POTUS tweets,
And not correct what's not true?
The latest one about bump stocks.
Please look it up. Thank you
1501 2018-03-25 12:45:07 After a School shooting, the #NRAimmediately claims people will come for guns, gun sales and stocks go up, and the NRA board is made up of gun manufactures. This is why they bribe politicians to allow children to be murdered. #MarchForOurLives
1502 2018-03-25 12:42:40 Trump said he just ordered a ban on bump stocks right?

Trump also said "we need to take guns quickly...worry about due process second"

Should we fear Trump?
1503 2018-03-25 12:42:25 Criminals don't use bump stocks so it's probably one of the most laughable policy decisions yet to date.
1504 2018-03-25 12:42:23 The ONLY Sino-American trade policies that make sense to the U. S. are to (1) confiscate ALL the U.

1507 2018-03-25 12:41:53 Have to be careful here. Fish do not respect national boarders and we must control stocks.

We must enforce #British only waters

We must also enforce no fish conservation zones

Some form of quota control will be needed but we must allow use of by catches discarding is obscene
1508 2018-03-25 12:41:31 Bump stocks aren’t the problem & never were. 
Obama was a farce from the get go.
Strings & puppet masters.

1510 2018-03-25 12:41:05 No one is saying you can’t/shouldn’t be allowed to own guns. Hunting rifles, handguns, rifles, pistols ...they are all fine! Several things public is asking for: assault weapons ban reinstated, better background checks, limit bump stocks like your boy Trump said he would #2A #nra
1511 2018-03-25 12:40:41 Pretty big shift from “Obama is coming for your guns” to “Obama legalized bump stocks”.
1512 2018-03-25 12:40:03 OK one more tweet before my 2nd . I'm reading a book on systems thinking & am struck by the uncritical way in which the book assumes that the mechanics of "physical" stocks such as a bathtub applies to "stocks" like your "reserve of energy" or "goodwill".
1513 2018-03-25 12:39:57 The main cause of market turmoil in these days is because of trade war fears not spending bill. In fact, some stocks got boost from this spending bill such as defense stocks. If you want to attack dems at least get your facts right lol
1514 2018-03-25 12:39:00 Neither
1515 2018-03-25 12:38:56 Bump Stocks / Full-Auto... That's a bullshit argument, semi-auto has plenty of killing power.  But you wouldn't know that, because you dodged the draft and never got trained. President PUSSY (just drop the Grabber... Stormy will fill in those details tonight).
1516 2018-03-25 12:38:18 No one is saying you can’t/shouldn’t be allowed to own guns. Hunting rifles, rifles, handguns, pistols... they are all fine! Several things that public is asking for: assault weapons ban reinstated, better background checks, limit bump stocks like your boy Trump said he would #2A
1517 2018-03-25 12:38:11 Similar laws must be applicable to private company salaries n profits made in stocks too.. 
If u feel price is too much don't drink it.. it's not compulsory after all..
1518 2018-03-25 12:38:06 They don't support a ban on bump stocks, its the most some are willing to concede to prevent further legislation and regulation.
And if they can prove they should be allowed to own guns then they're all set. 
Why is it that any failed argument ends in whataboutism?
1519 2018-03-25 12:37:52 Let us clarify something: while I’m personally against owning guns, we’re not talking about taking away people’s guns. We want: universal background checks, mentally ill to now be able to own guns, ban of high capacity magazines, and ban of all bump stocks. Lets start there.
1520 2018-03-25 12:37:49 Yes, hopefully they take note to how well our Republican President listened and is moving forward to take action. Including banning bump stocks ;)
1521 2018-03-25 12:36:21 The National debt is much more of a threat than bump stocks. Criminals will ignore the ban so this is BS
1522 2018-03-25 12:36:16 Florida has required universal background chks,raised age to 21 to.purchase guns,EPOS...Maryland increases funding for electronic machines to be placed in schools,EPOS,background checks.POTUS stated Friday no more bump stocks.STATES will address issues
1523 2018-03-25 12:35:55 True. And as most logical people know the "law" will not stop the crazy people anyway.  I am pretty sure the criminals will not line up to turn in their bump stocks just because the justice department makes them illegal.
1524 2018-03-25 12:35:08 Dont get me wrong... I dont believe people need machine guns. And a FULL background check WITH a waiting period should be mandatory. 
And the NRA can stick objections to common sense like that up their bump stocks.
1525 2018-03-25 12:34:47 I get you, but the AR isn't the M4. Looks the same, not the same capability.

Ban bump stocks, fine.

Ban trigger cranks, fine.

Ban 100 round mags, fine.

Civilian semi-auto rifles aren't military M4s.

You're not helping the conversation by equating them.

1527 2018-03-25 12:34:43 Adam Winkler, a constitutional law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles: „the Obama administration approved the sale of bumps stocks. Not because they liked it, but because the law did not permit them to prohibit it,"
1528 2018-03-25 12:34:32 Shreyas shipping and gravita can be future green stocks to look for Investment.
1529 2018-03-25 12:34:09 Dans la limite des stocks disponibles, oui 
1530 2018-03-25 12:33:50 I wore itchy lime green uniforms working at McDonalds ages 15-16. Blotches on my skin, yes. I hated the way they made my skin feel. Why is that guy getting so emotional over what you’re forced to wear? Stocks in #plastics ?
1531 2018-03-25 12:33:45 Pretty bummed about his directive to ban bump-stocks. Personally I think they're a toy designed to waste ammo with no accuracy but it sets a bad precedent whereby future leaders can go after any gun accessory, like magazines etc.
1532 2018-03-25 12:33:27 Am i missing something? 
The stocks only down from the previous year.
Fishermen educate the ffaw how to handle cod.
Caplin however is a different story.
1533 2018-03-25 12:32:55 The whole movement is not about grabbing.  Top demands: 
No bump stocks
Every gun purchase has extensive background check
High Capacity Magazine limit
No Assault Weapons (This is obviously a gray area)
There are things I agree with on both sides of the isle
1534 2018-03-25 12:32:47 That’s a good point, the assault weapons ban of 1994 banned gun accessories like lasers, grips, and shoulder stocks if I remember correctly. It didn’t ban any specific long rifles. btw not all federal laws are constitutional for example the patriot act was unconstitutional
1535 2018-03-25 12:32:44 I doubt seriously the President Obama advocated to use the bump stocks I don't know where you get your information got to be Fox News a Rush Limbaugh
1536 2018-03-25 12:32:21 Remember when Obama permitted bump stocks? Why isn't he on the hot seat? @foxandfriends
1537 2018-03-25 12:30:49 Hi Michelle, I've looked into this for you and can see we still sell the Marmite rice cakes, however, this seems quite popular as we've ran out of stocks. Not to worry though, the York Extra is expecting a delivery for more tonight. 1/2

1541 2018-03-25 12:28:47 Jesus talked about love the children.  I never saw mention of your AR15 or bump stocks or even a handgun in the Bible. Have you read it lately?
1542 2018-03-25 12:28:47 @niaCNN inside politics today's discussion failed to mention Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Friday formally proposing a ban on bump stocks. the impression ur panel gave was that nothing was happening b4 November. Do your homework pls.

1546 2018-03-25 12:26:50 Ban the weapon that uses bump stocks!! That’s how I know you all aren’t serious about gun reform!!
1547 2018-03-25 12:24:18 @stocks_william
1548 2018-03-25 12:24:09 Your ignorance is astounding. The NRA actually SUPPORTS regulating/banning bump stocks. . .

As for the "mentally ill" - that was SO broad sweeping, it was denying regular people rights.

Where is your screaming and outrage for Sheriff Israel and all the officers that failed?
1549 2018-03-25 12:23:56 Oh & they're called BUMP stocks. Not hump stocks. But since you love your weapons so much, I'm sure you knew that.
1550 2018-03-25 12:21:45 I can’t take rocks and charms but I can talk stocks and bonds
1551 2018-03-25 12:21:37 Lol wish someone showed me stocks when I was 5! Woulda been a lot better investment than my 1988-1992 baseball cards lol
1552 2018-03-25 12:20:58 Donald Trump is the greatest inside trader of all time. He can manipulate the stock markets with trade war comments anytime he wants. Did Trump or any of his rich friends start selling their stocks before he announced the tariffs to the world that is driving down stock values????

1555 2018-03-25 12:20:07 Banning bump stocks is different then banning guns that are capable of having bump stocks.
1556 2018-03-25 12:19:04 @realDonaldTrump We supported you and Scott in panhandle FL. One person uses guns to kill. Then you take bump stocks. Scott same in FL WHY..

1561 2018-03-25 12:16:48 Yes and many NRA members support common sense gun control and like to hunt animals not support selling guns and bump stocks to mass shooters
1562 2018-03-25 12:16:46 And, people who “hate” tech sure as hell should hate almost every other field. Market caps & concentration of tech stocks in massive index funds are very telling. While tech has its issues, hyperbolic & disingenuous statements gets us nowhere.

1564 2018-03-25 12:16:25 One Question? Where is the outrage against the previous Obama administration for legalizing bump stocks and who knows what even?
1565 2018-03-25 12:15:57 Also, you do realize Trump signed a bill that would end the sale of bump stocks, don’t you?
1566 2018-03-25 12:15:22 Great work @Awvee to walk that walk! Father+coach+man. 
1567 2018-03-25 12:15:12 Bump stocks are stupid but only used in one crime. I have no issue with them being going away. So long as that is all that goes away. The #2AShallNotBeInfringed when it comes to firearms.

1569 2018-03-25 12:14:48 Obama n'y est pour rien, il y a un vide juridique à ce sujet. l'ATF ne pouvait réguler les bump stocks puisque ceux-ci NE SONT PAS des armes. Elle n'a aucun pouvoir sur les accessoires. Ensuite Obama n'était pas en odeur de sainteté auprès de la NRA, ce qui a compliqué les choses

While you are out with these kids marching, a law passed banning bump stocks  Several weeks ago Florida's bill passed

1577 2018-03-25 12:09:21 The NRA is #complicit by lobbying and paying congresd for the relaxed regulations that put bump stocks on the market, revoked the assault weapons ban, and removed restrictions for mentally ill amongst other things. To think they aren't directly responsible is ignorant.

1579 2018-03-25 12:08:38 Overreaction. Guns will always be available. Your rights will be intact.  "Rights" always have reasonable limits. That is what the vast majority of people are looking for - universal background checks; waiting periods; no bump stocks, high capacity magazines, or weapons of war
1580 2018-03-25 12:07:10 Samsung will always sell cause of their online and offline availability in huge stocks... And their renowned service
1581 2018-03-25 12:05:37 $SPX..Hilarious..CBS news has a story "5 reasons stocks are getting slammed"..All of them I warned about 2 MONTHS ago. Especially the one about stock buybacks.
1582 2018-03-25 12:05:22 Bump stocks are prohibited in Canada, so are large capacity magazine, "assault rifles" are also prohibited. As far as ammunition you will never ban hollow points bullets they are safer and more human for hunting.
1583 2018-03-25 12:04:38 deduction. I believe that high capacity magazines should be banned as we’ll bump stocks. I think people should be able to have guns for self defense&to hunt. I believe that once you bring a gun into a public space, your 2nd amend rights are secondary to my right to Life & Liberty
1584 2018-03-25 12:04:13 It is still listed under prime now. What will happen if I cancel my order and order it with prime now? When I ordered it on Friday, the delivery was listed as Saturday and than you changed it. If the item is not in stocks, why is it advertised as one day and 2 hours delivery?

1588 2018-03-25 12:00:00 Liar. Congress, led by @SenateMajLdr, wouldn’t let Obama ban bump stocks.  Obama tried gun restrictions and even made it harder for the mentally ill to buy guns. You reversed that. The truth that hard for you?
1589 2018-03-25 11:59:50 Bump Stocks that easily turn it into full automatic
Large capacity magazines unnecessary for hunting/target
Ammunition designed to cause incredible damage when it hits.
Assault weapons are for killing humans. Sporting rifles are for hunting and competition.
1590 2018-03-25 11:58:58 Basically spraying antifreeze on out roads. The stuff that kills small animals. Who comes up with this shit. Must have stocks in chemical and gas companies.
1591 2018-03-25 11:58:47 We need to protect our fish stocks. Stop EU fishing our waters.
1592 2018-03-25 11:58:26 $DIA $QQQ $VIX last week seemed like an orderly decline without fear or exhaustion. Everyone talking about shopping lists of cheap stocks to buy thinking it’s over; That’s not fear. The final sell off is still lurking.
1593 2018-03-25 11:56:40 It's my secret hope. After the first US drop, everyone (infuriatingly) reacted like headless chickens throwing many Oz stocks even lower than the US did. Now there's a bit of form here maybe some much needed indifference might creep in.
1594 2018-03-25 11:56:36 Which is why the Vegas shooter had multiple guns with bump stocks.  I really don’t think he gave a rat’s ass about the guns... #thinkbeforeyoupost
1595 2018-03-25 11:52:58 So saying false things are okay @porinju - What if cos say false things and run it, would you buy that stocks ?? Problem is that only, saying things n no of times so that people feel all is true and false promises....
1596 2018-03-25 11:52:34 Ooh cool, we’ve just replenished our beer stocks
1597 2018-03-25 11:51:36 The majority of Americans DO want gun control!!!  There is no reason for people to have assault weapons or bump stocks. None whatsoever.
1598 2018-03-25 11:49:51 And which country is willing to eliminate its stocks? let's be serious
1599 2018-03-25 11:47:30 The kids want visible change, and frankly, there’s a lot of change that could happen without “taking guns away”. Why hasn’t Congress banned bump stocks yet? This is just inexplicable to me.
1600 2018-03-25 11:46:42 Hey man, the 2A says bear arms. Not bear bump stocks. We'll be ok. If you want simulated automatic, just get tye paperwork done, pay the money, and get licensed for the real deal. 

And stop fucking whining.
1601 2018-03-25 11:45:48 The NRA’s non-negotiable position is about to bite them very hard!  If they would be reasonable and negotiate for some changes it would be in everyone’s best interest.  Expanded background checks, age limits for assault weapons and handguns, bump stocks.
1602 2018-03-25 11:45:31 Who said anything about gun ban? They ask, as we've been asking... Do something!  Anything! Regulate! Legistrate! Get out of neutral. Make an effort on anything. Age limits, checks & balances, bump stocks, anything. What do YOU want to see change? YOU?
1603 2018-03-25 11:45:29 Universal background checks, no bump stocks, no domestic violence arrests, no restraining orders, assault weapons ban, mental illness ban, training mandates to start. 

Also, we have recently made phone use while driving illegal (and primary offense) in some states
1604 2018-03-25 11:45:21 No they aren’t automatic but you can get things like bump stocks that turns it into an automatic weapon

1622 2018-03-25 11:34:00 This was never about banning guns.  This is about compromise.  Get rid of bump stocks, high capacity mags, Dickey Amendment, military style assault weapons and lawmakers that belong to NRA.  No one wants to 'ban guns'.

1624 2018-03-25 11:31:00 Invert that, the big money knows their money is not at risk in banks as they get bailed out with newly printed money in case they go broke. They rather lose 5% annually to inflation than 50% in crypto or 30% in stocks. Sooner or later buying opportunity will arise.
1625 2018-03-25 11:29:54 And the NRA does not have an agenda???

And no is trying to take away all the guns from law abiding citizens.  But if you think it is OK for the mentally ill to stock pile dozens of military grade assault rifles with high capacity magazines and bump stocks, enlist in the army.
1626 2018-03-25 11:29:42 I don't think we're watching same kids. B/c these kids are changing things.  6 weeks ago would you have put any money on massive nationwide gun control marches? I didn't think so.

1641 2018-03-25 11:21:50 @CNN They put a ban on sub-machine guns. You still can acquire one, you have to pass a bit more background checks.

You, that have them grandfather them in. Those that want if you pass the background check for them.

Ban Bump Stocks.

Universal Background checks!
1642 2018-03-25 11:21:34 Bump stocks do not alter semi automatic function to "machine guns". What about bump firing off belt loops? Going to ban pants and index fingers too? Oh, and you can't just "ban" our personal property. You are President, not Emperor.

1645 2018-03-25 11:20:14 No one wants to take away your guns.  We hope to limit the killing capability of the angry and unbalanced. Keep your hunting rifles. Bump stocks; high-velocity, unjacketed rounds; silencers; high-capacity magazines must go.
1646 2018-03-25 11:19:57 Ask yourself, what did Bill Clinton do when Columbine happened? What did Obama do when Sandy Hook happened? They are both Democrats. Oh yeah Obama allowed bump stocks. Don’t you understand it does not mean vote out Republicans Our economy is the best it’s ever been right now.
1647 2018-03-25 11:19:34 They have a problem with access to ar15, bump stocks. Some communities DO have issue with hand guns. All guns kill people. The NRA is a propagandist faux non profit org. Maybe used to be legit? But now stand more for capitalism than lives. Jury still out on Russia involvement.
1648 2018-03-25 11:19:19 The AR-15 is a kissing cousin. Large capacity magazines, and bump stocks turn it into a machine for killing large numbers of humans. The projectile also does incredible damage when it hits, none of which is useful for hunting.

1653 2018-03-25 11:15:14 Are you that dense?  They’re marching for common sense gun control like assault weapons, universal background checks and bump stocks, which the vast majority of Americans (but not the NRA) support.

1657 2018-03-25 11:14:35 No Obama didn’t specifically approve bump stocks.  Moron.
1658 2018-03-25 11:14:17 and audience figure it out only at the end. 
1659 2018-03-25 11:14:15 Are they going to take away the bump stocks I already own?
1660 2018-03-25 11:13:59 armed Americans are not going to give up guns! ban bump stocks and require that mentally ill have deep back ground checks. DNC is behind uneducated demonstrations! Amy Schumer makes me wanna puke. every speaker at demo was inflaming clueless children. shame on all of them1
1661 2018-03-25 11:12:59 Let's hope they don't overfish again and bring stocks to their knees, so to speak.
1662 2018-03-25 11:12:31 I`m very disappointed with @AmazonUK recently. I already had two major issues this week and today they have delayed my prime dispatch for my Amazon Echo order and the reason is that they don`t have enough items in stocks. Why is it listed as a prime item than? @AmazonHelp
1663 2018-03-25 11:12:05 ピアスしてる男って何か嫌いなんだよなー。何ででしょ。
1664 2018-03-25 11:10:59 In the bill, Trump had Bump Stocks banned & reformed the background check process. But, you won’t hear this on #CNN
1665 2018-03-25 11:10:33 I bought it from a supplier from twitter.  you can check CNA if they have stocks.  so far kasi based sa supplier, it's sold out ata in SoKor. 
1666 2018-03-25 11:09:12 In 2000 investors had months to shift assets from the NASDAQ and growth stocks into value stocks and defensive sectors AFTER the NASDAQ peaked. I will demonstrate this in a vlog later today or tomorrow. That fact only partially mitigates the significance of the NASDAQ Hyperwave.
1667 2018-03-25 11:08:31 All the speeches on that stage yesterday small of the tragedy that happenedw Trump passed the restriction for bump stocks before the March no more bump stocks if you want support the president has your back he said he's not afraid of the NRA

1672 2018-03-25 11:05:58 @realDonaldTrump thank you also for the wise- and- humane ban on bump stocks + other mods meant to circumvent law. I am plsd at the civic involvement undertaken by Parkland kids. Ms #EmmaGonzales gave a moving presentation we won't forget. The flip side of a platform
is the need

1674 2018-03-25 11:03:42 This week will be devoted to the NASDAQ Hyperwave, and it's related correlative waves. As I mentioned in our vlog last night on YouTube #Hyperwave, in 2000, the NASDAQ went first followed by growth stocks, the Dow and the S&P. It was months before the overall top was in.
1675 2018-03-25 11:03:33 Yep. I’m alive much more than past. Great to meet u again. U also interested in stocks huh! Nice to know that.
1676 2018-03-25 11:02:22 There gose there last stocks, well it was fun well it lasted, even if i was to smart to be suckered in by this movie and dident see it
1677 2018-03-25 11:01:42 @realDonaldTrump wow. Stocks down record amounts on your shitty protectionist policies. Thanks. Idiot.
1678 2018-03-25 11:00:38 Trump not tweeting so much about stocks these days - 40 times between Oct 1 and Jan 26 when Wall Street was chalking up record high after record high . . . only once since.  Now it's DACA - the problem HE created!

12:03 PM - Mar 22, 2018
1679 2018-03-25 10:59:47 Dow and S&P 500 extend losses, both now down for the year. Trump not  tweeting so much about stocks these days - 40 times between Oct 1 and  Jan 26 when Wall Street was chalking up record high after record high...  only once since.
1680 2018-03-25 10:59:16 Bump stocks are a beginning. We need universal background checks, mandatory waiting periods, and we need to close the boyfriend loophole, among others, to stop the senseless violence.
1681 2018-03-25 10:58:21 What really will the anti-gun marches accomplish REALLY!
Smoke a little pot, boy meets girl( or boy) in most cases!
Laws! There already out there.
Background checks? We got them here!
Bump stocks? Should have never been allowed( my opinion)
INCREASE GUN PENALTIES FOR FELONS
1682 2018-03-25 10:57:03 A cursory google search shows your assertion that Obama legalized bump stocks is a LIE. You are an embarrassment to our nation. While I applaud working on measures to curb gun violence, you can do that without maligning an ex-president with falsehoods.
1683 2018-03-25 10:56:06 Yup. It's not a bad idea to have guns in your society. It's a bad idea to have it in the hands of every untrained and/or mentally unstable person in your society though. And you really really dont need 30 assault rifles and you really dont need 5000 bullets and bump stocks

1686 2018-03-25 10:53:08 Hopefully it does work out in your favor 
Cause you got some stocks to collect 
1687 2018-03-25 10:51:23 I wonder how come people are finding stocks cheap. Don't get anchored to last 2-3 years of high price multiples. They don't last beyond bull market period. Stocks aren't cheap yet.
1688 2018-03-25 10:51:12 Let's think about to where we should go for the gun regulation. 

The countermeasures like alarming, banning bump stocks doesn'not look enough to prevent those cases

USA, please make best efforts to live in more improved safe area. As a result, for the safty worldwide.

1690 2018-03-25 10:49:57 The white house’s response to the #Marchforourlives is that they are banning bump stocks, which weren’t used in Parkland. 
Trump is patting himself on the back for tossing a deck chair off the Titanic.
1691 2018-03-25 10:48:30 If we simply eliminate the sale of semi automatic weapons and bump stocks to civilians, it would go MILES in appeasing. i was in the military...i will  never understand why 2a supporters thing semi automatic weapons are a necessity

1701 2018-03-25 10:41:41 Why lie? Why not just state what you are doing? Truth:

The Obama administration didn't legalize bump stocks. 

Obama issued EOs for stricter control (all of which Trump has rolled back), but could not legally restrict (non mechanical) bump stocks w/o new laws. Congress refused.
1702 2018-03-25 10:41:04 We're beginning to ban / restrict bump stocks, which I'll take.  Actual full-auto machine guns haven't been involved in any mass shootings I've heard of, so I think that indicates that we're right to restrict their ownership so heavily.  FBI background checks apparently work ;)

1705 2018-03-25 10:38:48 Bump stocks are just a form of full auto. Other than Vegas they haven’t been used. You’ll never be able to stop crazy. You could ban all guns and we’d still have mass murder. Example: Oklahoma City
1706 2018-03-25 10:36:02 You can buy them online or in the bulldog shop along with a great book just in time for next Christmas, hurry only while stocks last #uuuudogs
1707 2018-03-25 10:35:37 The DOJ just announced new regulations that effectively ban bump stocks.  That is a fact.
1708 2018-03-25 10:35:36 Bump stocks are a joke get real.
1709 2018-03-25 10:35:04 John - The left doesn't want to destroy us.  Imagine if we just banned AR15s and bump stocks.  We could still keep all our rifles, handguns, etc. to protect ourselves per the 2a.  We lose very little, and in most cases we lose nothign.
1710 2018-03-25 10:34:36 gun violence Rises all around the United States while  the 2nd Amendment continues 2 be controversial  raise the age to 21 get rid of bump stocks and better background checks
 the change does not infringe on your rights you can still buy your guns but at an appropriate age

1714 2018-03-25 10:29:59 Obama did not make bump stocks legal you lying sack of sh*t! You lie about everything and nobody even listens to your bullshit! Resign and get out before you are impeached, convicted and thrown in jail!  As much as I’d like to see that happen to the most pathetic person on earth!

1716 2018-03-25 10:29:08 Another LIE Trump.  Obama NEVER legalized bump stocks. You're just struggling with your inferiority complex again. #SAD
1717 2018-03-25 10:29:05 When the public is in danger, amendments can be placed to ensure that the People are safe and in order to be safe, some freedoms must be strict. We have restrictions on the 1st amendment. They are not asking to ban the 2nd Amendment, just to stop sells of bump stocks and AK.
1718 2018-03-25 10:29:02 With the realization that "semi-automatic" isn't a genie which can be put back in the bottle. Civilians have had semi-auto guns for over 100 years. 

Are we talking about limiting mag capacity? Plastic stocks & hand guards? Accessory rails? Carbine barrels? Muzzle brakes? fin
1719 2018-03-25 10:28:08 The next revolution will be an economic revolution, n it will be led by millenials. We will undo all that's been put in place by our parent's generation, cuz I refuse to give 20-30 years of my life just for some jerk off to tell me my pension is gone cuz he gambled it on stocks.
1720 2018-03-25 10:28:07 Equity markets no longer accurately reflect the nature of any broad economy. Most stocks are held by large groups managed by large firms using bots.
A better indicator of the health of the US economy is the pay of Black and brown women.
1721 2018-03-25 10:27:24 Twitter has become a graveyard recently or else every day I would hear stocks like Dilip this, Rama that...yeah stocks unheard of named after people going up 20% and people hailing themselves as geniuses for having the knack to spot multi-baggers. Now Nothing, not a single pip.
1722 2018-03-25 10:27:03 Nope. Bump stocks weren’t used in Parkland shooting, so you’re totally irrelevant.

Try again.
1723 2018-03-25 10:26:58 And in other news (barely seen on Faux News) hundreds of thousands of US citizens took to the streets to demand action on gun control. And that DOESN’T mean just banning bump stocks. You are pathetic.

1737 2018-03-25 10:05:15 * 6 million homes at £100k apiece average, current social housing stocks ~ 1.5M council houses + 4.5M housing association properties.

We get the use of 1.5M homes for that £9B a year from the private sector. Staggeringly bad value.
1738 2018-03-25 10:03:46 We drop £9B a year Housing Benefit on private landlords.

If we spent that on National Debt interest repayments instead, it would back £600B of capital - enough to double social housing stocks* in the UK, and actually turn a profit for the Treasury because we'd be taking the rent
1739 2018-03-25 10:03:21 You’re a kid yourself so please take your own advise & get your facts straight! No one has stated they wish to disarm citizens! A ban on ARs, lg clips of ammunition & bump stocks would still leave you with weapons to protect yourself! You’re a puppet for NRA

1745 2018-03-25 09:58:19 11/ medical stocks out of U.N. mandated Red Crescent deliveries into Ghouta. I mean if they let any through in the first place. This is a crime against humanity nothing less.
1746 2018-03-25 09:58:15 You can’t be serious! The men who created the Constitution never imagined, in their wildest dreams, that the right to bear arms would include an AK47 or bump stocks to increase the carnage capabilities of a gun. These courageous souls have lived through horror. Have you?

1765 2018-03-25 09:35:14 Not a hidden agenda....right out there in front, get rid of weapons of war, get rid of bump stocks. Inforce background checks on ALL sales. no sales to mentally ill, or domestic abusers, all weapons to be registered.
1766 2018-03-25 09:35:12 Kids and gun control is the same as me being a rocket scientist, just does not fit. Banning bump stocks, thats good. Banning my right to protect my life in the manner of see fit, plain wrong. Life IS worth defending. #EnoughIsEnough Stop this propaganda!

1773 2018-03-25 09:24:51 Santander are a rip off. I ditched their 123 account as was getting a pittance. Don’t invest in any stocks just now, you’ll lose money. The only ones who’ll make are Santander with the up from fees. They don’t give a toss about you once they have your money cos risk is all yours!

1776 2018-03-25 09:24:19 MR PRESIDENT DON'T TURN TO THE DARK SIDE , BUMP STOCKS ARE NOT THE PROBLEM GUNS ARE NOT THE PROBLEM.
1777 2018-03-25 09:21:31 With several indices at MA200 and many stocks at or below as well, we might see markets unwind. If that happens I will position on the short side. Until then (or new highs) I believe it's just like @AsennaWealth says: this is a do nothing market
1778 2018-03-25 09:19:29 Some of your typical 'Buffett value stocks' in #PSE: $ANS $HI $FLI way undervalued (cheap if you will), low-key, but great long term business prospects. #PSEi

1781 2018-03-25 09:17:38 UKgov has multiple motives for doing something like this, and opportunity and the means. 
Not shown that Russia had any motive, or the means to do this.
OPCW verified all Russia's CW stocks destroyed by Sept 2017.
If UKgov 'knows' otherwise, UK violated CWC by not notifying OPCW
1782 2018-03-25 09:17:33 I thought Trump already banned Bump stocks (whatever that means)
1783 2018-03-25 09:17:31 His administration did not legalize them. The way the laws were written bump stocks were classified as parts that couldn’t be stopped. Republican Congress refused to change the law. You listen too much to propaganda from Fake News Fox.
1784 2018-03-25 09:15:41 You said semi-autos, not bump stocks.
1785 2018-03-25 09:15:36 U might me a romantic but don’t mix work and play my radical friend (a weird one who trades stocks )
1786 2018-03-25 09:15:12 A tiny minority are wanting to disarm. Most want better background checks & bans on bump stocks & assault rifles. You are listening too much to the propaganda on Faje News Fox.
1787 2018-03-25 09:14:38 I agree with you Mike, and I hope too cause I 've many stocks long.... but let's see this week what is going on, I don't trust too much in this market right now....
1788 2018-03-25 09:14:08 How about the laws put through to stop bump stocks that has passed. Doing much more than your silence
1789 2018-03-25 09:13:21 You are badly mistaken. Most people do not want guns confiscated. They want better background checks and a ban on bump stocks & assault rifles. You are listening too much to the propaganda Fake News Fox.

1795 2018-03-25 09:04:21 I believe what you’re saying about the New World Order. However, as far as what they’re fighting for, they’re trying to eliminate military style guns and bump stocks from the hands of anyone other than military, not all guns. Or at the least raise the age of obtaining it legally.

1802 2018-03-25 08:57:18 Bump stocks?  Really.
1803 2018-03-25 08:54:43 I want actual solutions along with that b/c banning bump stocks alone will solve nothing 1 mass shooter out of how many has used one. The biggest problem is liberals won't listen to those that have real solutions.
1804 2018-03-25 08:54:41 Did you realize you just sucked up another Trump lie?  The Obama administration did not legalize bump stocks.  They concluded that bump stocks could not be regulated based on the language of the current law in effect.

I have no problems with them using bump stocks as a compromise b/c there is no practical use for them that I can tell & no one has been able to tell me a use for them when I ask but it could result in a domino effect

1813 2018-03-25 08:46:32 Yes, it takes time to get reform. But we *did* get reform. Of the CAP and CFP. Fish stocks are recovering *because* of joint action by EU. Without that, we’d have no fishing industry at all.

1817 2018-03-25 08:44:14 2.  High capacity magazines, bump stocks and other legal mods allow these killers to take many more lives in a short amount of time. Vegas, for 1 (59 dead, 527 injured in about 12 mins.)Lax gun show & inheritance regulations also give easy access to folks who shouldn’t have guns.
1818 2018-03-25 08:41:17 Oh, is that why Obummer made bump stocks legal?  Oops.  Nice work, that.  Just ask a school kid.
1819 2018-03-25 08:40:41 Disagreeing with former President #Obama is one thing, but blaming him for for legalizing bumper stocks for no reason is just #pathetic.

1832 2018-03-25 08:29:40 Looking for equity compounders (2/x) : This makes an opportune time to adopt a back to basics approach focusing on high quality. Despite strong equity performance over the last few years, these compounders, or high quality franchise stocks, still offer relative good valuation
1833 2018-03-25 08:28:13 Which stocks to buy in this correction please advise

1835 2018-03-25 08:27:13 Then we are in agreement if we can compromise and come together on reform and control. I am not really for a ban of any firearm. I am for bans of bump stocks specifically.
1836 2018-03-25 08:26:33 Trump flat out lied about Obama legalizing bump stocks.
1837 2018-03-25 08:26:16 @MarkStott1 ok. Bowling stocks will be low if all of the leadership group get banned.
1838 2018-03-25 08:26:04 Elections are far away for market. When I talk to business owners, none said that politics is going to affect their business in any way. You need to choose stocks which are insulated from political risks. It may be relevant for some infra, real estate, mining company at most.
1839 2018-03-25 08:24:52 I don't think Obama legalized bump stocks

1843 2018-03-25 08:21:07 So Trump has banned bump stocks,$ to strengthen background cks., $ for school security & my personal favorite, establishes a school safety commission! More crossing guards perhaps ? Ban the assault rifles you MORON !

Obama's administration *did* approve bump stocks and yet Trump seems to get the blame for them.
1858 2018-03-25 08:09:00 Bump stocks are not machine guns, still have to pull trigger for each shot.

1860 2018-03-25 08:05:22 Not about Bump Stocks. About the freedoms you give up b/c you won't deal with the real issues.People mask actual problem. Do we ban everything that someone will abuse?

Why do we ban them? B/c of those who abuse the privilege.

If you invest in the wrong stuff, you lose it all. We have to bear our share of responsibility for the investments we make.
1871 2018-03-25 07:56:46 I agree. That is the need of people to not want to be shot. But I think you need to understand what semi automatic weapons are. I agree bump stocks have no place in private use. But what do you think a semi automatic weapon is?
1872 2018-03-25 07:55:25 That’s called democracy and it’s not that easy. The needs of our people are not to fear being shot at school and no one needs assault weapons or (semi) automatic weapons, or bump stocks. Right?
1873 2018-03-25 07:54:21 I do not see a good reason why bump stocks are necessary. Can anyone who is against their ban please share your reasoning behind it? @PalisadesKid @ronnie_dodge what are your thoughts on it? #BumStockBan #MarchForOurLives

1878 2018-03-25 07:45:31 And Trump banned Obama era law making bump stocks illegal before he went golfing
1879 2018-03-25 07:45:10 Nope. I am 100 percent behind mandatory background checks and bump stocks. So maybe you should take the time to read my other tweets and not misrepresent me.
1880 2018-03-25 07:44:09 Don't be an Idiot you KNOW this is NOT true!

Bump stocks do NOT turn rifles in to automatic
firearms!

Bump stocks only allow ONE round fired for every trigger pull!

Why do you continue to say that?

Your looking foolish!

1902 2018-03-25 07:16:34 Not only that but hes divided the GOP into 3rds. Nra supports are mad he is banning bump stocks, "trumpians" are mad at the @gop for the spending bill without the wall, and the rest of the gop has no idea what to do. Democrats are more United than ever.
1903 2018-03-25 07:16:10 Please note: the President banned bump stocks yesterday and conservatives who love the constitution (“DACA wasn’t done right!”), and especially the second amendment, say nothing. Always remember who these people are.

1905 2018-03-25 07:15:40 There will be tits & tats on trade & uncertainty on data regulation but after the storm, people will realise that tech stocks still offer rare high growth that people pay a premium for and the FAANGs are just so dominant. Tech will rise again. Rates are still incredibly low

1915 2018-03-25 07:01:28 RT realDonaldTrump "Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns."

1919 2018-03-25 06:59:10 America sees more school shootings than EVERY other first world nation and debates clear backpacks and bump stocks.

Canada sees one and debates if making sellers keep records of buyers for 20 years and requiring stringent licensing is enough.

1920 2018-03-25 06:59:09 Paul Ryan didn't even know he passed a law allowing the sale of bump stocks. Weird since he voted to pass it but he didn't know that was in there years ago. Why? Cuz he didn't write it the NRA lobbyist did. The speaker couldn't be bothered to read his own legislation

1929 2018-03-25 06:46:06 There is common ground!  Suppprt it. Universal background checks (90% approval by Americans) and a ban on hi cap mags and bump stocks. Highly popular with both parties. Pass it. Now.
1930 2018-03-25 06:45:41 No, they didn't. They couldn't make them 'illegal'. To re-evaluate bump stocks, the ATF would have to change the way it interpreted the National Firearms Act or issue new legislation that would allow the device to be regulated. Neither of which would have been embrace by congress

1933 2018-03-25 06:42:42 Wow, how dare you say I won’t look at it. What? Bump stocks banned, age limit maybe increased? Wow, what a major victory. Also, bravo for calling an intelligent, kind man who knows more than me and you, a defeatist.
1934 2018-03-25 06:42:36 Kill 58 people and wound 851 others in under 10 minutes like the Vegas shooter did.. we can ban AR 15s, bump stocks and high capacity magazines while upholding the second amendment.. we can have universal background checks with longer waiting periods while still allowing guns.

1938 2018-03-25 06:40:22 How about banning all the rifles that bump stocks enable into machine guns? How about only our soldiers possess these weapons—this isn’t hard to comprehend!
1939 2018-03-25 06:39:08 Ironic coming from a guy who ran an administration that turned a blind eye to bump stocks.
1940 2018-03-25 06:38:51 @CricketAus in addition to lifetime bans for entire Aus squad, Smith and Warner should additionally be made to tour the country with a mobile stocks set up. People can then throw tomatoes at them for a day in each town. I’m offering to arrange this, pl let James Sutherland know.
1941 2018-03-25 06:38:25 Please. Stop with this reductionism. No one is seeking disarmament. We are seeking a reinstatement of the ban on assault weapons, a ban on extended magazines, expansion of background checks, and a ban on bump stocks. No calls for a ban on hunting or handguns.
1942 2018-03-25 06:36:35 Make a statement in front of press that says after realizing Obama made a egregious error legalizing bump stocks that took 58 life's in worst domestic shooting in american history u will do the right thing and make them illegal.
1943 2018-03-25 06:34:11 You probably shouldn’t be discussing bump stocks without prior knowledge of how difficult it is to keep a bump stocked AR firing rapidly...while fighting muzzle flip to hit close targets in a high stress situation. The bank guard would still win.

1953 2018-03-25 06:24:43 Not true! No bump stocks, no assault weapons. Universal background checks.

Maybe some other things like gun safety training before buying your first gun. Limit magazines to say 10 rounds unless you have a license as a collector similar to what people do now before buying auto.
1954 2018-03-25 06:22:54 BTW, school shooters didn't use bump stocks. Only the vegas shooter.
1955 2018-03-25 06:22:42 @CNN @ABC @NYTIMES @WASHINGTONPOST @MSNBC @CBSNEWS 
Now, Trump have started a trade War around the world with some of our biggest competitors. Most trade Wars normally leads to inflation. As the Stocks currently are reflecting this. Not good.
1956 2018-03-25 06:22:16 Mr. President, you have been a man I greatly respect and admire, but this doesn’t actually help anybody. We don’t need more restrictions. Now, the only people with bump stocks will be law breakers therebye putting law abiding citizens at greater risk.
1957 2018-03-25 06:21:22 3% of the population has 50% of the guns. 87% don’t own or want a gun. Why should the minority dictate gun policy? Don’t the rest of the citizens get a say. No assault rifles, bump stocks, require background checks.

1960 2018-03-25 06:18:13 Isn't it interesting that all the Left major share holders sold their stocks in these social media platforms a while ago. Same thing the Obama campaign did in 2012 but now, it is evil. Quit pretending to be balanced @nationalpost
1961 2018-03-25 06:17:40 Actually, he didn't make them LEGAL. The current law prevented him from regulating bump stocks. The ATF would have to reinterpret the law, it new legislation allowing regulation would have to be issued. 

The 1934 Nat. firearms act. Read it.

You guys are sure gullible.
1962 2018-03-25 06:16:38 Where were the marches after Sandy Hook, and why didn’t Obama do anything about it? In fact he legalized Bump Stocks

1966 2018-03-25 06:14:02 The Truth simply is no longer part of your MO. Obama Admin DID NOT legalize Bump Stocks. Bumps were built for paraplegic gun operators ... the rest is part of a hate-oriented society YOU sir are instigating
1967 2018-03-25 06:11:10 Obama let the ban on bump stocks end without a word. wtf are you talking about? When the centrist dems held power they didn't do a thing.

1970 2018-03-25 06:07:25 They have become laughing stocks
1971 2018-03-25 06:05:56 (PART 3)

•Increasing legal age to purchase weapons to 21
•Eliminating all silencers and & bump stocks.
•Pass a gun violence restraining order law that would allow courts to disarm people who display warning signs of violent behavior.

1976 2018-03-25 06:04:03 Can’t you just have one tweet that is not a lie? Obama did not legalize bump stocks.  They were never illegal in the first place.   Goodness gracious.  Try to do something without blaming someone else.

1987 2018-03-25 05:55:34 1/ In 2010 the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives determined that because bump stocks don't have any moving parts, they are a "firearm part" and could not be regulated as a firearm under existing gun laws. The ATF reached a similar conclusion in 2012.

2007 2018-03-25 05:41:58 Note: banning semi-automatic center-fire rifles makes bump stocks useless, since they don’t work on any other type of rifle.

2016 2018-03-25 05:39:04 Though I will admit that Trump smacked his head on something and did something that's actually a good thing by banning the bump stocks. The manufacturers of bump stocks probably didn't pay the NRA enough.
2017 2018-03-25 05:38:57 WHAT ABOUT 3D PRINTED BUMP STOCKS???
2018 2018-03-25 05:38:16 Do you realize you're making money off these protesters. Probably the NRA buying stocks in Michaels art supplies for Spike and banners and trip tickets to Washington DC airlines are making tons of money off of somebody else's pain. That's how sick of a government where in?
2019 2018-03-25 05:37:43 Loosened them? Sure, because putting restrictions on the mentally ill is loosening the rules. Or is it Trump's tweet about Obama legalizing bump stocks? You do realize that this is completely inaccurate, do you not?
2020 2018-03-25 05:37:16 Thing is a cop with a pistol stands no chance against a rifle with a bump stock. Pretty sure the Trump administration is pushing a bill to ban bump stocks though which is good. Not sure what else is next but there should be more action taken
2021 2018-03-25 05:36:59 The bump stocks gave the AR-15 a more lethal option for a single shooter than a 3 round burst. Also, maybe you would point me in the direction of a vet that supports the claim that an AR is not basically the same as an M4, because I keep reading their posts that say differently?

2036 2018-03-25 05:23:56 This #MarchforOurLives is so ridiculous. They don't want to just ban bump-stocks, not just assault rifles, not just semi-automatic rifles, not just universal background checks,  "they" want to outright get rid of our 2nd Amendment!!

I cannot believe how you lie constantly and consistently! If anything Obama tried to put in place a measure of some sort of gun control and the REPUBLICAN PARTY would not vote on it!! You r very good at passing the buck onto someone else!

2040 2018-03-25 05:19:35 Last time i checked assault rifles were already banned! Bump stocks yeah! Im a big fan of the Armament Rifle, but no civilian needs a bump stock! Stricter backgrounds are just fine too! But instead of blaming guns, lets look at why kids are even killing kids.......

2042 2018-03-25 05:17:31 Remember, that YOUR government has declared "bump stocks" as legal???
2043 2018-03-25 05:16:42 Donnie’s wants a medal for waiting for NRA permission, more than 4 months after assault rifles and bump stocks were used to kill 58 people & injure 851, to sign an EO banning bump stocks. He can’t talk his own party into passing actual legislation, but thinks Obama could have?
2044 2018-03-25 05:15:43 Und genau diese Regierung hat z.B. diese "bump stocks" als "legal" erklärt!
2045 2018-03-25 05:15:03 How many deaths in Maryland compared to Florida shooting ..or Las Vegas..or Newton.. Banning 
assault weapons is common sense..bump stocks and high volume magazines..you want a weapon of war ..join the Marines !
2046 2018-03-25 05:14:59 A final thought to the hard heads who don't read or listen:
1. AR stands for Armalite Rifle 
2. Bump stocks should be banned
3. High capacity magazines should be for military use only.
4. The 2nd Amendment Rocks 
5. Abortion is killing too. 

Good night all.
2047 2018-03-25 05:14:54 Yes. @BarackObama lies like a colander and his fans believe him. Bump stocks. The NRA, police, military, normal rational citizens opposed them, but Obama, he made them legal.
2048 2018-03-25 05:14:41 that happens because of a story they write? I believe in the 2nd but I support smart gun control laws. I think better background checks are good, a waiting time is also fine, bump stocks should be illegal, and I personally don't see the need for an assault weapon in the home.
2049 2018-03-25 05:14:37 Sie wissen, dass die viel zitierten "bump stocks" von der Obama-Regierung als "legal" erklärt wurden?

Nein?

Das dachte ich mir.
2050 2018-03-25 05:13:48 You’re an idiot if u think that the debate is about complete disarmament. Its been almost impossible to even get bump stocks and semi automatics banned, the NRA has a strangle-hold on congress where even tiny changes can’t get passed, hence all this frustration now
2051 2018-03-25 05:12:57 I will be part of it too so long as we are not talking about banning and disarming law abiding citizens. Strict background checks and improving mental health systems I am all for. Making things like bump stocks illegal, I am not opposed to either.
2052 2018-03-25 05:12:16 In my list of weak stocks..:)
2053 2018-03-25 05:12:11 I'm not even kidding here. Why are we talking about banning bump stocks, specific rifle types, when handguns are still legal?
2054 2018-03-25 05:11:13 As soon as foreigners landed here they start spending money in our economy by getting something to eat, a place to sleep and petrol to travel. Then some buying a house and start paying tax and services to local government. Some investing in stocks etc and so it go on and on
2055 2018-03-25 05:10:18 &it has so much potential to actually become big/popular all over the world if done well.
but no, SM would rather waste their money and time on dumb merch and buying other companies' stocks or whatever they're doing
2056 2018-03-25 05:09:45 There's a lot to unpack here. The bump stock ban going national? Whatever. Bump stocks physically harm your body while you use them.
2057 2018-03-25 05:09:44 なるほど

2060 2018-03-25 05:08:06 Exactly. Bump stocks should be banned since they can mimic full auto gun fire
2061 2018-03-25 05:07:36 To be honest I’m surprised it wasn’t more. I think bump stocks helped reduce deaths. I’ve shot bump stock, all it does is give quick rush of automatic fire, if you get technique right. Control in accurate aiming. Had he just fired semiautomatic directed fire
2062 2018-03-25 05:07:17 You're a dork. For years, gun regulations have been proposed and never has anybody suggested banning all guns. Background checks, no straw purchases, no semi auto, no armor piercing ammo, no bump stocks, etc. Try to keep up.
2063 2018-03-25 05:04:12 That's why we want more than banning high power weapons and bump stocks. Background checks. Registration.  Licensed.  Training.  Tests. Removal in cases of domestic violence,  etc.
2064 2018-03-25 05:03:19 I didn't say no attachments. I said accessories (i.e. High capacity magazines, bump stocks) that allow mass shooters to kill more people faster. If someone wants a scope for their hunting rifle I don't care.
2065 2018-03-25 05:01:33 You clear now..  NRA and TRUMP can shape this the way they are .

Bump stocks we're approved through a loophole in the law that was approved twice by the ATF. as "firearm part" and could not be regulated as a firearm under the existing gun laws
2066 2018-03-25 05:01:18 Life is indeed the single most important possession we have. I don't own an assault rifle, and I will consent certain restrictions need to occur (banning bump stocks for instance). Further, I endorse these brace students exercise of their first amendment rights.

2071 2018-03-25 04:58:54 Rick Vasquez an ex ATF official involved in the decision to approve bump stocks That to blame the administration implies that Obama or AG Eric Holder were involved in the determination 
We never had any political people come down to our office saying we must or must not approve,
2072 2018-03-25 04:57:51 Correct. Even in our Kolkata too many resellers are charging Rs 500 to 2000 extra over the cost of Mi smartphones and people are also paying due to unavailability of stocks in mi homes & in online flash sales.
2073 2018-03-25 04:57:06 Also, Trump is the one who wants to ban bump stocks and seize guns without due process, meaning that YOUR Republican president is more anti-gun than Obama.

2075 2018-03-25 04:57:01 Actually it's not. The American public cannot buy full auto ("rapid fire") rifles and things like bump stocks are now, iirc, illegal.
2076 2018-03-25 04:55:02 So banning bump stocks does not change or deny the 2nd amendment, it's a restriction. Why care much abt bump stocks anyway they don't work.
2077 2018-03-25 04:54:53 Adam Winkler, constitutional law professor at the UCLA,  Yes the Obama administration approved the sale of bumps stocks. 
"Not because they liked it, but because the law did not permit them to prohibit it,"
2078 2018-03-25 04:54:22 We already have gun reform moron.. have you ever read the laws
Maybe the problem is those who inforce it.

2082 2018-03-25 04:52:06 I have to say and quote u " #AR15's are not assault rifle" is a serious understatement. @Parkland this individual came in with an Ar15 and killed 17 ppl in 6 minutes . How can you not consider this an assault rifle with or without bump stocks, which he had none yet killed 17 ppl.
2083 2018-03-25 04:51:55 NRA Tripe..
In 2010 the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives determined that because bump stocks don't have any moving parts, they are a "firearm part" and could not be regulated as a firearm under  existing gun laws. 
The ATF reached a similar conclusion in 2012.

2090 2018-03-25 04:48:57 Or if not ban on the AR15 or similar then get rid of those stocks that can change them into the machine gun style weapons which are already on the ban list
2091 2018-03-25 04:48:13 The NRA has been against bump stocks for a long time and also most gun owners don't believe in them. A pistol has a larger round and can fire just as fast as any AR and most "intruders" will bring a pistol because it is easier to conceal
2092 2018-03-25 04:47:55 Such as the pistol grip in that photo, which is technically legal because it is classified as a "thumbhole stock" because of the connecting bar, and thumbhole stocks are legal and unrestricted. Another eg is magazine capacity ...
2093 2018-03-25 04:47:42 The LV guy is what changed things for me re AR-15’s. Able to kill or injure hundreds in a few minutes. Guns (plus bump stocks) were purchased legally.
2094 2018-03-25 04:47:27 I agree the public doesn't need bump stocks or other equipment that should only be in the hands or the military or police.    Please never let anyone take our 2nd amendment away and other rights.
2095 2018-03-25 04:47:09 That must be why Trump can't do anything about bump stocks either.
Oh, wait!
2096 2018-03-25 04:45:54 Yes they do. The more we let government control our lives, inch by inch rights get taken away. It starts out with banning bum stocks, age restrictions, certain guns being illegal and then a total ban.Thats how its done.The real prob is the laws we have not being enforced.
2097 2018-03-25 04:45:46 Mine are easy. Keep the guns. All of them. Let’s just enact universal background checks on a go forward basis. End bump stocks. The genie is out of the bottle. There are 1.1 guns per person in our country. We can’t and shouldn’t take them back.
2098 2018-03-25 04:45:26 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to improve your phantom limb syndrome
2099 2018-03-25 04:45:10 bump stocks are pointless, they jack the weapon around everywhere. would you like to see what 'accurate' fully auto looks like?
2100 2018-03-25 04:45:01 So glad they are involved!  Tell them@to consider voting for the man,  the party that prohibits bump stocks!   Trump and team. Can’t believe Obama allowed those things.
2101 2018-03-25 04:44:07 Well guess you have decided you only want to spend 4 years in the White House, guess government will confiscate Jerry Miculeks trigger finger as well. How many bump stocks have been used in these shootings,None that I know of. This isn’t about safety, it’s about anti gun agenda
2102 2018-03-25 04:43:58 What gun show loophole? What more can they do in the background check that is required nationwide? Banning bump stocks nationally is already in the works.(FYI, The NRA doesn’t allow them)

2104 2018-03-25 04:43:06 An airplane or truck is not a wrapon either but they were used to kill many. AR 15s are not assault rifles. They are not designed to fire fully automatic. M16 and M4 rifles are assault rifles. Limit magazines, eliminate bump stocks. Don't ban the rifle.
2105 2018-03-25 04:42:18 So glad trump stopped bump stocks!  They were allowed under Obama.
2106 2018-03-25 04:41:56 He didn’t!!!! His administration in fact legalized hump stocks!! He talked a good game about a lot of things while he did the opposite. .
2107 2018-03-25 04:41:15 Who knows how many people will see this comment but all of this is not going to end the way you guys want... you are ignorant and controlled by the media. I don't have enough characters to tell you why but know that starting with "bump stocks" will just roll down hill real quick.
2108 2018-03-25 04:40:57 And yet YOU did NOTHING. Oh wait... your administration APPROVED bump stocks! Sit down!
2109 2018-03-25 04:40:45 If you propose an evidence-based solution like permit to purchase, rather than whine about having to make more than symbolic concessions like bump stocks, you may find everyone wins and your complaints moot

2111 2018-03-25 04:38:15 It was the ATF that decided Bump Stops were legal because they weren't guns and didn't have moving parts.  Obama just happened to be POTUS at the time.  Geez..most people had never heard of bump stocks until the Las Vegas massacre.

2113 2018-03-25 04:37:47 ATF : In 2010 Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives determined that  because bump stocks don't have any moving parts, they are a "firearm  part" and could not be regulated as a firearm under existing gun laws. 
The ATF reached a similar conclusion in 2012.
2114 2018-03-25 04:37:17 Being only against rifles is very short sighted. :( I can take two handguns and have the same rate of fire as a semi-automatic rifle. I know you know that, but I'm worried that others might overlook that. S'why bans of bump stocks or whatever are also irrelevant.
2115 2018-03-25 04:36:46 Fact Check.
The administration did not think they contravened federal regulations against machine guns, as they did not modify the  machinery of guns themselves
Bumps stocks were approved. "Not because they liked it, but because the law did not permit them to prohibit it,"
2116 2018-03-25 04:36:38 To all you dumb ass  people out there you fuck with Trump he's the worst but you will laugh with Schumer and Nancy but your stocks drop and guess what Trump wins we are going to war that's why he took the deal  snow flakes you fucked this world up thank your libral parents
2117 2018-03-25 04:35:23 I keep seeing tweets from the right, maybe far right, that democrats want to take all guns away. That is patently false, I'm a democrat, we only want assault weapons, intended for military use, banned, bump stocks banned and common sense background checks. Hunt away, legally!!
2118 2018-03-25 04:33:46 Can you share some high dividend yielding stocks
2119 2018-03-25 04:33:28 Pres Trump, I saw the depth of anger, desperation, betrayal, courage, hope, political will of children. when children become leaders and leaders become children, change is in the making“. And banning bump stocks is not bravery but cowardice. What are you all hiding?
2120 2018-03-25 04:33:28 Obama’s ATF determined current law didn’t allow for regulation of bump stocks—they didn’t “legalize” them.
Trump Admin has yet to “ban” them in any sense. They still need to change regulations to do so.
Get your facts straight before you tweet.

2126 2018-03-25 04:30:09 Interesting. Have you found a statistically significant pattern to stocks that beat by a certain %? When might we see this?
2127 2018-03-25 04:29:29 Making bump stocks illegal will do nothing to end gun violence in the US. This is a PR move.
2128 2018-03-25 04:29:12 Was doing a screening of stocks and noticed that the div yield column has swelled quite a bit, for obvious reasons. Another parameter that's making stocks lot more attractive.

2130 2018-03-25 04:28:37 A half truth, Mr. Trump is a whole lie.  The ATF ruled that BUMP STOCKS had no moving parts so the AFT deemed them legal!!! Obama just happened to be POTUS at the time.
2131 2018-03-25 04:27:41 Well, it's deadly with or without one but not as deadly without one. Las Vegas compared to parkland or multiple others shows a huge difference. But I agree. Banning bump stocks is not enough.
2132 2018-03-25 04:27:32 What exactly does God say about bump stocks, Joe?
2133 2018-03-25 04:26:46 Bump stocks and similar ways to modify the AR-15 & M-4 became popular about 20 years ago

The NRA changed completely in the 70s

Weapons that I'm describing developed 60s, 70s, 80s

20 years ago Australia had a mass shooting, they made a change, they've had 0 since
2134 2018-03-25 04:26:19 Most of those 50% probably favor stricter gun regulation in the form of banning bump stocks and other attachments that make guns exponentially more lethal. Most likely do not support gun control to the same extent that the liberal agenda would prefer.
2135 2018-03-25 04:25:58 He's only banning bump stocks, but that's only part of the problem, unfortunately.
2136 2018-03-25 04:24:10 It happens slowly. First the bump stocks and  then AR-15's with certain features. Then AR-15's in general, and then all semi automatic rifles. Then semi automatic handguns. Give them an inch, they take a mile.
2137 2018-03-25 04:22:46 Stocks go up and down.
Lawyer--who cares?
McDougal--who cares?
Democratic March--political stagecraft. But they are good at it.
Omnibus--yes, the base is annoyed, but more at RINOs than the President. 

My parting tweet of the night.
2138 2018-03-25 04:21:30 $CALI hit or came near 423.6% extension and hence retraced back. Meaning met objective.

Sorry - no penny stocks.
2139 2018-03-25 04:21:27 Sick of R's GIVING in! Trump just banned bump stocks! I expect this crap from the D's not from the R's.
#betrayed
2140 2018-03-25 04:20:34 You like bump stocks and want anyone to be able to by a gun? SAD!!!
2141 2018-03-25 04:20:24 We could make a crazy leap to that level on $DEEL
2142 2018-03-25 04:19:28 Banning bump stocks does not revoke your second amendment ..
2143 2018-03-25 04:19:18 The mass shooting itself forced our state gov, some are which my friends, to address the age limit.  Which does absolutely nothing. But sounds great in a headline. Bump-stocks I am fine in making a class 3 requirement.  These kids are being used & funded by leftist groups to push
2144 2018-03-25 04:18:27 #AskBigT What is your advice for someone just starting out in stocks?
2145 2018-03-25 04:18:27 Vegas shooter was a legal gun owner.  Bump stocks turned his weapons nearly fully automatic. Gun laws in this country are a joke.
2146 2018-03-25 04:18:25 Bump stocks are unnecessary. As for the AR-15, with the exception of black plastic trim, it is essentially the same as 99% of hunting rifles. They don’t need to be banned for looking scary. And why protest the organization that promotes gun safety and responsible gun ownership
2147 2018-03-25 04:18:14 It’s not nitpicking. Define what makes one fun more dangerous than another and let’s find a way to mitigate that danger. Black composite stocks and accessory rails don’t make a gun more dangerous. I want my legislators to be educated and informed, not just scared.
2148 2018-03-25 04:17:49 I also would consider that mass shootings are going more common and grotesque. The Las Vegas shooting, with its high casualty count and random cruelty, didn't even merit a ban on bump stocks afterward. So people feel like Congress will do nothing. so it's up to us.
2149 2018-03-25 04:17:16 Surely there is something the NRA can do to help though. This is tainting their business and reputation. They have to help. Deeper universal background checks is a good start, but bump stocks need to go. There is room to reach consensus, Jim.
2150 2018-03-25 04:16:59 So why do you focus on the AR-15 there are dozens of rifles that do the exaxt same thing but they have wood stocks so they're good
2151 2018-03-25 04:15:20 Obama did not legalize Bump Stocks. You pulled that out of your ass! Every lie of yours is record setting! Only your base buys your BS lies!
2152 2018-03-25 04:14:48 I joked about Kratos being a software programmer and having an easy time hacking Forcystus' base, and was told that we need that au now.
So. Distant depressed dad who is a software programmer and is too tired to not help his young boss inflate stocks to steal from the investors?
2153 2018-03-25 04:14:41 Gun laws probably won't help either. I just don't think anything will help at this point. Call me a Debbie Downer, but getting rid of guns and bump stocks I don't think is going to change anything. I might be wrong. I hope I am, but I doubt it.
2154 2018-03-25 04:14:26 The NRA uses fear mongering to get their people all fired up. Some people see through that & they are in agreement with basic things like banning bump stocks. However, the ignorance paranoid NRA people get all worked up over the relatively minor change we are suggesting.
2155 2018-03-25 04:14:15 When you accidentally click on your stocks and see they’re down 
2156 2018-03-25 04:12:24 Listening?  We are asking for specific things: ban assault rifles, ban bump stocks, stronger background checks, require gun licenses and insurance.  If you are not fighting for all of these things, YOU are NOT listening!  #utpol #NeverAgain
2157 2018-03-25 04:12:01 He needs to bugger off, educated, degree holding ppl are having a convo. Trying to better the world, w/o this childish, political rhetoric coming from Trump voters. The man is destroying our health, stocks, EPA, and risks world war.
2158 2018-03-25 04:11:16 This has reminded me to get stocks soon tbh
2159 2018-03-25 04:10:15 J I L B A B 

on-hand
very comfy
Limited stocks

PM for Orders and reservations
2160 2018-03-25 04:10:09 That Obama allowed bump stocks? Is that why bump stocks were legal during his presidency?
Lol
2161 2018-03-25 04:10:07 My vitamin water stocks doesnt last long smh
2162 2018-03-25 04:09:55 We are NOT for taking away the #2A!!! For the 1,000,000.00 time, it's around sensible gun control as in any assult rifle (like the AR-15), high capacity magazines, and bump stocks!! Get that through ur minds!!!  
#FormerNRAmember
SensibleGunControl
2163 2018-03-25 04:09:53 So then I was correct when I said *No stocks*
2164 2018-03-25 04:09:35 Stocks On hand
2165 2018-03-25 04:09:10 Banned bump stocks so that’s more then Obama did. How much money did the NRA give Trump? NRA spends very little money on campaigns. It takes hundreds of millions for a presidential campaign so their few little million is unnoticeable the NRA hates gun violence by the way
2166 2018-03-25 04:08:55 Just so I know, what is your idea of "sensible gun laws"?  Mine are eliminating high capacity mags, bump stocks and raising the age for all gun purchases (except pellet and BB) to 21 (exception would be military personnel).  I'd include deeper background checks and 3 day waiting.
2167 2018-03-25 04:07:47 Stocks Move Sharply Lower Amid Rising Tensions - ,Stocks Move Sharply Lower Amid Rising Tensio...
2168 2018-03-25 04:07:43 Read it again slick.
Obama allowed bump stocks. Period. Full stop.
2169 2018-03-25 04:07:41 @porinju HI sir , Please suggest some stocks which u think can become mulitibaggers in the future..i time horizon is for long term
2170 2018-03-25 04:07:40 In a way yes. Look at any legal definition of an assault rifle and it focuses on fixed vs detachable magazine, pistol grip, and folding or telescoping stocks.
2171 2018-03-25 04:07:36 Nobody is saying that you can’t own a gun.  People are begging for reform where bump stocks and automatic & semi automatic guns are not available to civilians.
2172 2018-03-25 04:07:16 Consistently get met with the ‘resources are cyclical’ arguement when taking investment in resource stocks. You don’t need to buy a basket of all of them, just focus on the ones with tailwinds like the Chinese do so much better than we do. Such an opportunity for Aus here.
2173 2018-03-25 04:06:51 Obama allowed bump stocks.
Pretty clear keith.
Appreciate your desperate verbal gymnastics to cover for him though. Pretty hilarious slick.
2174 2018-03-25 04:06:15 There’s a hell of a lot more going on here than bump stocks
2175 2018-03-25 04:05:13 That's a lie. The Obama Administration did not legalize bump stocks.
2176 2018-03-25 04:05:07 The only thing they should do is ban bump stocks and make magazines smaller
2177 2018-03-25 04:04:33 So Obama allowed bump stocks.
Got it.
2178 2018-03-25 04:03:17 LIAR LIAR LIAR!  

The Obama administration didn't legalize bump stocks. 

Obama issued EOs creating stricter controls (all of which Trump has rolled back), but could not legally restrict (non mechanical) bump stocks without new laws. Congress refused.
2179 2018-03-25 04:03:01 Background checks, wait period or no bump stocks doesn't infringe on anything. Also doesn't say what arms.
2180 2018-03-25 04:01:52 You're not Jeremiah after he was locked in the stocks by the Temple official Parshur. You ARE Parshur, who ignored God's word, corrupted the Temple, and brought about God's wrath. Maybe read the book instead of picking and choosing from SparksNotes to further your agenda, kid.
2181 2018-03-25 04:01:51 My son stocks up on Elmo’s like niggaz with sneakers, boy Is on #6 
2182 2018-03-25 04:00:40 Keep your shot guns and your hand gun for self defense. Don’t try to argue that you need AR-15s and bump stocks for self defense. Why can’t you admit that they aren’t necessary and they are designed to be killing machines?!
2183 2018-03-25 04:00:20 Trump banned bump stocks
2184 2018-03-25 03:59:54 Last 18 months ,made a killing on shorting e&p stocks, oil ramps,oil pukes play ERY/DRIP
2185 2018-03-25 03:59:31 Trump banned bump stocks
2186 2018-03-25 03:59:12 #MSNBC @AriMelber
Rick Tyler, you're very dishonest.
Assault Rifles:
Short barrels for maneuverability in combat
Extractor mechanism, for jams under fire
Accessory mounts for flash suppressors, silencers, muzzle brakes, foldable stocks, tactical lights
NOT a hunting rifle
2187 2018-03-25 03:58:48 I'm more about licensing and banning bump stocks than anything else.

I also believe gun owners should pass marksmanship, judgement (psych), and eye tests. Depending on the gun.
2188 2018-03-25 03:58:02 No one wants your shot gun or hand gun @TomiLahren. But don’t try to tell me you need an AR-15 and bump stocks to defend yourself. We call bullshit.
2189 2018-03-25 03:58:02 Truly Sir. People were running behind stocks at crazy multiples and now aren’t putting in money.
2190 2018-03-25 03:57:26 is not allowing large magazines, bump stocks and military type rifles a slippery slope to allowing people to have napalm, explosives and nuclear weapons? i think just the opposite is just as absurd.
2191 2018-03-25 03:57:04 I like oil stocks and the whole sector. Lots in bear flags but they pay to own. Don’t really want to buy anything that doesn’t pay me for anything more than a scalp. Also a general theme in stream lately.
2192 2018-03-25 03:56:59 Universal background checks, banning bump stocks... It's not so hard if you care about humans. Arming more people isn't the answer. Especially people who don't care to be armed.

What happens when a kid in the classroom gets the teacher's gun & starts the rampage there?
2193 2018-03-25 03:56:41 Absolutely unbelievable the under-performance of energy stocks.
2194 2018-03-25 03:56:24 Donald bump stocks does not stop the massive killing of human beings, why not cut down on the number of rounds that can go into a magazine.  Wouldn't that save more lives.
2195 2018-03-25 03:56:21 Bump stocks should be illegal in my opinion or should at the very least be a class 3 restricted addition. And yes top competitors have an increased ROF. These insane shooters are not top competitors.
2196 2018-03-25 03:56:19 The ATF under Obama decided it couldn’t legally regulate bump stocks. Quote different than saying Obama made them legal.
2197 2018-03-25 03:55:44 It takes literally zero training to turn an AR15 into an automatic weapon (just buy a bump stock), and bump stocks were legal in many places until the LV massacre.
2198 2018-03-25 03:53:00 Then we can raise the age of gun ownership, bump stocks gone, ar15s no longer sold here (besides by the already irresponsible gun owners that currently don’t keep them out “bad guy’s” hands (we should all know by now that these murders get these guns via irresponsible gun owners)
2199 2018-03-25 03:52:52 STOCKS!!!
2200 2018-03-25 03:52:32 Quick google search: 1. Ban semiautomatic high velocity weapons ie, AR-15. 2. Ban bump stocks. 3. Universal background check. 4 Raise age limit to 21 to buy firearms. 5. Ban second hand gun sales (gun show loophole)
2201 2018-03-25 03:52:29 You understand how insulting and borderline ignorant your comment is right?Many who strongly support 2d amend rights also believe in rational limits.Banning rapid fire assault rifles, bump stocks, background checks & licensing qualification & confirmation do not violate 2d Amend.
2202 2018-03-25 03:51:59 No President is perfect, though he did good job overall. Sounds like bump stocks are even more useless than I thought. Didn’t one of the Bushes have a ban on assault rifles that just didn’t get renewed? We should look at what is safest for all
2203 2018-03-25 03:51:37 First they came for our bump stocks...
2204 2018-03-25 03:51:16 No, dude. That’s your FEAR talking. You can have a handgun &/or a rifle, as long as you’re qualified to carry. What you can’t have are assault rifles. Or bump stocks. Common sense gun legislation.
2205 2018-03-25 03:51:03 When? I'd like to invest in some safe stocks...
2206 2018-03-25 03:50:27 Fake news. Again Trump does not tweet the facts correctly.   Besides banning bump stocks does not do much to gun control.   Firearms should be totally banned.
2207 2018-03-25 03:50:19 @mr_tex lmao! I ain’t tryin to date you. Just a smart mind on stocks
2208 2018-03-25 03:49:52 ATFdecided it could not regulate bump stocks during the Obama administration. It’s important to note this was not a statement of Obama’s preferred policy, which called for more regulation of guns, but was what the agency determined it had to do under the language of current law
2209 2018-03-25 03:49:52 I would prefer that gunmen with bump stocks & weapons meant for war weren't in our schools, night clubs, shooting out of hotel windows at people at concerts...
2210 2018-03-25 03:49:24 @repgregwalden We The People say it is time to make America SAFE again..... ban assault weapons, bump stocks and high capacity magazines.  Regan was ahead of his time on this - why not you?  No more excuses.   #neveragain #PowerToThePolls #EnoughIsEnough

2213 2018-03-25 03:48:02 I tried both. Both 2 stocks marth did better
2214 2018-03-25 03:47:26 @realDonaldTrump President Trump, banning bump stocks is not enough! Either change the 2nd Amendment or ban all assault rifles OR you lose my vote for you, forever! 
PS. With 2nd Amendment, am I allowed to arm myself with nuclear weapons? It is an antiquated amendment. CHANGE
2215 2018-03-25 03:47:23 Not all of us are fighting for all guns to be taken away, most of us realize that’s unrealistic. Honestly, I don’t want any guns at all, but I realize that’s extreme, not fair and violates 2A. Thus, I’m fighting for stronger BG checks, no ARs, no bump stocks, and 21 yo min.
2216 2018-03-25 03:47:02 rappers get rich n blow their money fast. when i get rich im investing into stocks and properties money is all i care ab
2217 2018-03-25 03:46:49 it still looks nice. light stocks are great
2218 2018-03-25 03:46:26 Well said  2nd Amendment is completely obsolete & should be repealed. That is where the discussion should begin. Not with background checks & bump stocks. Normal people should not find excuses to own guns. It's sick!
2219 2018-03-25 03:46:20 Bans are coming. And it's starting with Trump unilaterally banning "bump stocks". That gives a future president the authority to ban things like "magazines" and other things by claiming it turns a regular gun into a "machine gun".
2220 2018-03-25 03:45:57 Homicides from gun violence will start to go back up after economy caves and stocks crack further
2221 2018-03-25 03:43:31 Actually since the massacre at his school, he and the other kids at that school have made the state of Florida implement a new gun law. Nation wide gun laws are changing, in my beloved Washington State we banned bump stocks last month. #BoycottNRA #TheResistance
2222 2018-03-25 03:42:55 Foreign exchange comes into the country in several ways. Foreign investors buy SA stocks and bonds or invest directly, off shore bankers lend us money, foreigners buy SA products, foreign tourists visit here and spend their money. It’s all good for us.
2223 2018-03-25 03:42:14 Donald - seriously, you have to stop all these obvious lies. It’s not like we dont know better. Not like we don’t know that legalizing bump stocks had nothing to do with actions Obama took.
2224 2018-03-25 03:41:51 Because there are good uses for it for people with chronic pain. People kill others when they text and drive? You know why? Because not everyone uses them for bad. I am all for common sense gun laws. I agree no one needs bump stocks. But I'd also
2225 2018-03-25 03:41:40 Pistols with telescoping stocks and barrel shrouds?  

This is your brain on drugs.
2226 2018-03-25 03:41:34 Reduce gun stocks to revolvers and pistols, you'll drop the murder rate, and will keep the 2nd amendment as well. As simple as that ;) :D
2227 2018-03-25 03:41:23 How do people go out and party 3 nights in a row? I don’t understand, I can’t even make it through 1 day of classes without multiple naps and still need to be in my bed by midnight
2228 2018-03-25 03:40:59 I agree, although I think outright prohibition is too far. But yeah, I was raised with guns but also raised with common sense. Universal background checks on all transfers, waiting period, ban on hi cap magazines, ban on assault rifles, ban on bump stocks, all I support.
2229 2018-03-25 03:40:35 I know why you didn't show up to support, because you the one who approved bump stocks...
2230 2018-03-25 03:40:16 Two ex-Googlers want to replace your costume shop with a parcel locker that only stocks one product per day.

2233 2018-03-25 03:39:08 well if it was hard to make, then no stocks makes sense i think because some things take forever to make from scratch compared to just ripping stocks
2234 2018-03-25 03:38:30  NTN24 es una vergüenza en periodismo.Los bump stocks no aumentan la potencia de las armas lo único que hace es disparar por ti. Una arma semi automática, significa que tienes que jalar el gatillo cada vez que quieras disparar. IGnorantes!!
2235 2018-03-25 03:38:27 listen drama queen - ban assault rifles - background checks - ban bump stocks
2236 2018-03-25 03:38:21 also the DOJ announced that it will attempt to regulate bump stocks as of yesterday which is likely a result of people being up in arms about this whole gun issue. the people demanded change and the administration is doing something even if it's not a huge deal.
2237 2018-03-25 03:38:20 Meanwhile; the measuring yard to the human QUALITY is the INTELLECTUAL BALANCE. Not how handsome, prtetty you are, or how much paper bucks you got in your banks stocks.

Obama issued EOs creating stricter controls (which YOU have rolled back), but couldn't legally restrict non- mechanical bump stocks without new laws. 
Congress refused.
2240 2018-03-25 03:37:52 The Obama Administration did not legalize bump stocks.

Lying, or ignorant?
2241 2018-03-25 03:37:30 Another one of your LIES. Bump stocks were approved by ATF because it was the only thing they could do under current law.  Nobody said "Hey, let's put bump stocks on the street!!!"
2242 2018-03-25 03:36:36 There are already laws for two of the three. Bump stocks can go I agree. Next
2243 2018-03-25 03:35:59 You have no constitutional right to bump stocks, so shut up.
2244 2018-03-25 03:35:19 Fun fact: Obama legalized bump stocks
2245 2018-03-25 03:34:27 We don't want you to not have guns.  (1) We want universal background checks. (2) We want to ban bump stocks (which are not guns themselves). (3) We want only the military and law enforcement to have assault rifles.  None of these 3 things keeps you from having guns.
2246 2018-03-25 03:33:32 Me too I also am against bump stocks anything military style actually All guns I used for hunting small game in Ozark woods were sold
2247 2018-03-25 03:33:27 What are the intermediate highs for these stocks. Point to point might look bad but what if someone had sold at a high. #Howtoliewithstatistics
2248 2018-03-25 03:32:37 You’re on the wrong side of history and we will it shout it from the rooftops that you’re an NRA puppet funded & elected by the NRA & their $. The vote will take you out. The 2nd Amendment can stand beside common sense gun laws & bans on weapons of war like AK15s & bump-stocks.
2249 2018-03-25 03:32:34 I read the article.  The only thing Mia Love is talking about doing is bump stocks. She is a fraud and so is this headline
2250 2018-03-25 03:32:06 If you need some amusement, head over to DT's page and check out the replies to his tweet about banning bump stocks. YW
2251 2018-03-25 03:32:01 Funny thing, Obama didn’t get a new tax code implemented, but Trump did. Trump moves the embassy to Jerusalem, not Obama. Trump has made moves to curve gun violence by banning bump stocks, Obama didn’t. Trump has slashed regulations, Obama only added red tape. You’re wrong.
2252 2018-03-25 03:31:47 Bump stocks can be easily made in just MINUTES..banning would accomplish nothing.  Want gun control, get your murderous sons to stop killing our endangered species for FUN... AND FUN ONLY! AND REINSTATE BAN ON BRINGING TROPHY PARTS INTO OUR COUNTRY!  THAT IS SICK!!!
2253 2018-03-25 03:31:39 Get your facts straight.  In 2010 The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives determined bump stocks had no moving parts, therefore could not be regulated under existing laws.  2012, the ATF agreed.  Start telling the whole truth!
2254 2018-03-25 03:31:24 Why can't guns be treated like cars? The infrastructure is already there & we always need jobs Have gun owners take a mental, written & practical test, then they register, title & tag every gun. Ban bump stocks & ARs from civilians. #ReasonableGunControl #AllLivesMatter #NoMore
2255 2018-03-25 03:30:45 Be honest? OK...

Universal background checks weren't filibustered after Sandy Hook. A bill was brought to vote. It lost 54-46.

Bump stocks were deemed legal during the Obama administration by the ATF. Until the rules/criteria change, it's their call.
2256 2018-03-25 03:30:30 @RealDonad_Trump 
Banned bump stocks. At least U've taken 1 STEP in right direction.

?Do U have courage 2 stand up 2 NRA & go rest of the way? BAN sale 2 gen pop of semi-auto weapons & their ammo. Step 3-b.g. checks 2 purchase even @ gun shows.

Yrly renew 4 conceal & carry.
2257 2018-03-25 03:29:49 If Obama had banned bump stocks or expanded background checks, you'd have hung him in effigy..... hypocrite.
2258 2018-03-25 03:29:28 賢章お渡しあるのか
2259 2018-03-25 03:29:25 Really Barack? Something to consider: Adam Winkler, a constitutional law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, told PolitiFact that it is accurate to say the Obama administration approved the sale of bumps stocks.
2260 2018-03-25 03:27:56 It's not easy extrapolating carbon stocks using peat bulk density. A small magnitude change in Db (eg 0.2 g/cm3) could literally mean doubling Db, and thus C.
2261 2018-03-25 03:27:46 It doesn’t matter it’s the criminals and bad guys that don’t follow laws. You think they care a bill is passed about bump stocks.
2262 2018-03-25 03:27:09 I Promise you IT HAS for me and my family. And some of the stocks we have invested in.
2263 2018-03-25 03:27:05 Large capacity magazine. High muzzle velocity. Easily fitted with a bump stocks and other illegal mods. Popular with terrorists. Designed primarily for killing large numbers of people (shitty hunting weapon, shitty for self defense). Pick one.
2264 2018-03-25 03:26:31 Time to check your #stocks
2265 2018-03-25 03:26:30 I want to restrict bump stocks, guns for domestic abusers, assault rifles, and guns for those who can’t pass a background check. But you can keep the rest. Will every life be saved? No, but some will, and aren’t those lives worth something? It’s #guncontrol not a ban. #GunReform
2266 2018-03-25 03:26:28 Hmmm..wonder why the President issued his FIRST EXECUTIVE ORDER  in regards to #GunViolence by eliminating future sales of Bump Stocks. Wonder why he made it about Guns?
2267 2018-03-25 03:26:17 $FlSR I can only hope the same people are here that was in $AZFL that stocks went too.0075 I thank this will go to .0015 or .0025 good luck
2268 2018-03-25 03:25:48 Afternoon all, 

We have a great promo happening right now! Buy any Hard Yakka product and you will get either a cap or a beanie! Promotion is happening until stocks last 
2269 2018-03-25 03:25:32 You people and your damn Second Amendment. Bump stocks, extensive background checks, and waiting doesn't infringe on anything.
2270 2018-03-25 03:25:23 Yeah it's almost as of the gun grabbers wouldn't be good faith negotiating partners.

  Who would have guessed?

Welp, back to buying gun company stocks.
2271 2018-03-25 03:24:56 OMG. Y’all need to stop. Why don’t you look into the emoluments abuses occurring at the DC Trump hotel, or Trumps pay for play activities or Icahn’s dumping of steal stocks days before the steel tariffs. This administration stinks of corruption to high heaven
2272 2018-03-25 03:24:22 I support the 2nd amendment but AR rifles & bump stocks are too dangerous. Enough is Enough, use non lethal weapons. Tasers can immobilize someone with a gun. A safe alternative, a misfire won’t kill an innocent bystander. #MarchForOurLives  #GunContolNow @NRA #GunControlNever
2273 2018-03-25 03:24:04 Bump stocks do nothing! Your just appeasing us. We are not a stupid..
2274 2018-03-25 03:23:22 Obviously. Its tragic. Im all for raising buying age to 21, with background checks, and I love that Trump banned bump stocks. Just not sure what else there is to do on 2A. You cant ban ARs without banning cars that go over 90 MPH, capping alcohol sales per day. Slippery slope.
2275 2018-03-25 03:22:41 You think black people in the hood are threatened by $2,000 'assault weapons', with a total death toll of <250 lives / year? You think they give a damn about bump stocks?
2276 2018-03-25 03:22:03 If you think Williams is more credible, you really are stupid.  And stocks?  They're fine, it's called long-term investing.  Two or three weeks of losses mean nothing.  You'd know that if you were an actual investor.
2277 2018-03-25 03:20:50 NRA only came around on bump stocks after Vegas. You have absolutely no idea what the CDC will come back with because we’re never fully funded proper research. AR-15’s are but one part of a much larger discussion.
2278 2018-03-25 03:20:47 Death Cult? Please provide evidence of said cult. You do realize the NRA doesn't produce, sell or distribute firearms, right? They called for bump stocks to be regulated, FYI. NRA teaches responsible gun ownership in our country/teaches children how to safely operate a firearm.
2279 2018-03-25 03:20:45 The guns that should be banned are the ones with barrels rifled to make bullets tumble, “assault rifle style”. Also ban large capacity magazines, & any device allowing full-automatic firing like bump stocks. Also we need universal law so people can just jump to a lax-law state.
2280 2018-03-25 03:20:31 Bring back the Assault Weapons Ban of 1994, revise it to include modern day mass killing weapons. Ban bump stocks, ban semi-automatic weapons. Let's start getting rid of them now.
2281 2018-03-25 03:20:01 I am opposed to bump stocks like the one used in Vegas. I believe modifying an AR to make it full auto should be illegal.
2282 2018-03-25 03:19:45 It’s not binary. How about regulating magazines and banning bump stocks.  Universal background checks. Tell me why that is unreasonable.  And then we’ll go from there. You can’t buy a bazooka, right?  Get real, try and have some sort of love for your fellow people
2283 2018-03-25 03:18:57 President Obama signed the bill allowing gun makers to sell Bump Stocks, and no amount of lying rhetoric can change this fact. Congress approve Bump Stocks and Obama signed the Bill.
2284 2018-03-25 03:18:41 Are you a felon?Are you mentally ill?Do you want to purchase bump stocks?Are you under 21?If you answered no to all of the above, then none of what these protesters are asking for applies to you. 
Nobody is coming to take yourguns.#MarchForOurLives #NeverAgain #GunControlNow

2286 2018-03-25 03:17:14 We might agree more than you think. Longer waiting periods. Temporary rights suspensions for crime/diagnosis. Bump stocks GONE. All guns restricted to 21 yrs old except for active duty military. Get rid of online concealed carry courses. High capacity magazines GONE.
2287 2018-03-25 03:16:51 Yeah, so you know trump just signed his 1.5 Trillion dollar budget, virtually ensuring his border wall will never be built.. also, banning bump stocks.. so yeah Tomi, Suck it!
2288 2018-03-25 03:16:48 Misread your tweet, deleted the reply.

Bump stocks should be banned, I agree with that. Wanna shoot faster? Learn how. Banning the AR-15 will just lead to them choosing a different weapon tbh. It's not really more dangerous than any other gun.
2289 2018-03-25 03:16:22 although, w regard to AQR, in a convo w a PM running a competing man. fut. MF, the PM told me that AQR made a biz decision to try to be somewhat inversely correlated to US stocks. Felt the demand for a strategy w negative correlation was higher than for non correlation...
2290 2018-03-25 03:16:10 Where did Heath get to?
2291 2018-03-25 03:15:29 A lie the Obama administration did not legalize bump stocks. He issued stricter controls that you rolled back
2292 2018-03-25 03:15:24 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to cure your autism
2293 2018-03-25 03:15:14 Uhh, bump stocks are going to be banned.
2294 2018-03-25 03:15:11 @realDonaldTrump You are interferring with our 2A rights POTUS.  If we want these bump stocks we will get them to stop the police from killing us because they have those machine guns.  Better to ban the Police and civilian Officers of having them FIRST.
2295 2018-03-25 03:15:07 You agreed that RPGs should can be banned, augmenting with bump stocks can be banned, so I assume you are OK with fully auto weapons can be banned? You are pro 2A and for some gun control.
2296 2018-03-25 03:14:49 Really? Then I wonder why 4 out of 6 rifles used in the las Vegas shooting (that had bump stocks btw) we're jammed and out of commission. It couldn't be a coincidence now could it?
2297 2018-03-25 03:14:10 Dear President Obama we need a leader as yourself back in the White House. The one that’s in there now isn’t leading this country he’s drowning this country. The stocks market is going down and he’s throwing all the good work you did out.
2298 2018-03-25 03:13:55 #AskBigT How did you get into stocks and how old were you when you first started?
2299 2018-03-25 03:13:29 #LairinChiefObmam did not legalize bump stocks Why do you lie
2300 2018-03-25 03:12:33 The AR-15 is not an "assault rifle".  It is a semi automatic rifle that looks similar to a fully automatic assault rifle.  There are many hunting rifles that share similar shooting characteristics.  The only difference is the hunting rifles  have wood stocks and traditionalstyle.
2301 2018-03-25 03:12:18 I guarantee the police don't need ar-15 or bump stocks
2302 2018-03-25 03:12:14 Glad I haven’t pulled trigger on copper stocks but I’m patiently waiting as I think long term electrification is a great trend.
2303 2018-03-25 03:11:11 Bump stocks were about Vegas. Why the big time lag? This march is about AR-15 rifles which a child should never be able to get a hold of.  You can fool #cult45 all of the time because you are not a thinking person's president, but not the UK and Europe. #NRABitch
2304 2018-03-25 03:10:28 What police officer wants assault weapons and bump stocks in the hands of evil crazed people? This is for law enforcement too if you think about it.
2305 2018-03-25 03:08:41 And the ATF under Obama signed off on bump stocks
2306 2018-03-25 03:08:40 Bump stocks do nothing, anyone can make them. Capacity is also nonissue, shooter can reload w/confidence if no one confronts him w/a gun.
2307 2018-03-25 03:07:49 He never legalized bump stocks just couldn’t make them illegal because theyre technically not weapons. Get you facts straight!
2308 2018-03-25 03:07:06 That said, some common sense regulations on gun ownership really won't hurt anyone. Limits on capacity, bans on bump stocks, a national registry, all that. Maybe even "gun insurance" like I've heard suggested recently. Protect responsible gun owners.

2312 2018-03-25 03:04:42 Obama did not legalize bump stocks. The laws that already existed were not enough to prohibit or regulate bump stocks. Obama tried passing gun regulations and you have been working hard to undo every single one. We all know who the real asshole is. Hint: It's orange.
2313 2018-03-25 03:04:12 Haha.. “it could NOT regulate bump stocks” “it had to under the language of current law”... you’re welcome.
2314 2018-03-25 03:03:59 God man learn something about history. Obama couldn't do anything. Congress had to pass laws to eliminate bump stocks. No way the Reps pass anything with Obama. Maybe gas but definitely not necessary laws. They still can't pass any and Reps control everything except spending.
2315 2018-03-25 03:03:19 Columbine happened in 1999, during the ban, with a banned gun. Dems had a super majority in Congress in 2009 & could have renewed it. The roll back was this year, and wouldn't have effected any of the shootings this year. Obama approved the sale of bump stocks.
2316 2018-03-25 03:03:11 A gun is an assault weapon. Period. That's what it's designed for: assault, one hopes, a deadly one. They are talking about bump stocks and semi's with large magazines. I don't even have a problem with that. It's the attainment and proper "handling of" which I take issue.
2317 2018-03-25 03:02:56 I was changing channel on TV when Jim Cramer during Obama & HRC's closing down coal mines--Jim said oh, G. Sorros is buying up all of Peabody Coal stocks right this minute!!! I was so mad!! We had coal mines that were shut down near us 'cause Obama drama, just for Sorros profit?
2318 2018-03-25 03:02:52 Falco's Shine is so dumb.

2325 2018-03-25 02:57:18 Wow what a BIG FAT LIE. You TRULY LIE BIGGER AND BETTER than EVERYONE IN the world. Obama did NOT legalize bump stocks.
2326 2018-03-25 02:56:52 Noticed quiet on the Trump tweeting front . Is he speechless on the marches and falls in stocks and shares ? Has he nothing to say about the historical failure of trade wars ? What’s the bet his next tweet will be about  a  mad wall or a  rant against the Democrats?
2327 2018-03-25 02:56:21 But Boss. We trade and bet on stocks. Why care about emotions??
2328 2018-03-25 02:56:17 I made a brief foray into right wing twitter & I've noticed a huge change in rhetoric. Now it is all about how "Obama legalized bump stocks" (not true), no students protested when Scalise was shot (true, but neither did Congress), etc. This means it is working! #MarchForOurLives

The NRA and it's lobbyists R out of control.
When I was a kid we NEVER had 2 worry about being shot up in our classrooms. NEVER.
What's changed since I was a kid? 
Available semi automatic guns/bump stocks/ammo
2331 2018-03-25 02:56:06 From Investopedia: "This game is exceedingly risky for people who do not understand it." That's me - won't be playing the stocks any time soon.
2332 2018-03-25 02:55:44 Your ATF allowed bump stocks twice...
2333 2018-03-25 02:55:27 The current people that can write legislation are the same ones that filibustered universal background checks after Sandy Hook and refused to ban bump stocks after Vegas.  Be honest..
2334 2018-03-25 02:55:25 too many deaths in the last 5 months... the ar might be Trump's next change of mind. Myby a scapegoat. Bump stocks just went.  He is getting predictable as you just saw with the  not-veto ... nice chat
2335 2018-03-25 02:55:09 @realDonaldTrump Great work on the Bump Stocks. We need all school resource officers to be ARMED, need full BAN on assault weapons, background checks, waiting period ......
2336 2018-03-25 02:54:55 Firstly there is the Federal Assult weapons 1994 ban which expired in 2004, and somehow the world didn’t end.
Then there is the rollback of the ban on person with mental illness gaining access to weapons.
Plus the bump stocks that modifies a semi-auto to a full-auto.
What do I no
2337 2018-03-25 02:54:32 are you trying to mess with their stocks too
2338 2018-03-25 02:54:07 Trump is an idiot. President Obama ( the last legitimate US president ) did not legalize bump stocks. BAD IDEA was what I said to the clueless gullibles who wanted to vote for Cheater Cheeto, VERY bad idea

2341 2018-03-25 02:51:51 He signed a bill that lifted the ban which impaired the CDC from studying gun violence and also expanded background checks. He also directed the DOJ to see whether the ATF can ban bump stocks citing exisiting laws or via executive order. What else is on your wish list?
2342 2018-03-25 02:51:36 I just posted my opinion..just like whatever you want to do..why are u looking at day trading stocks then just bet on some long term stocks
2343 2018-03-25 02:51:21 Banning AR15s, bump stocks, having thorough background checks at all points of sale (yes you can buy AR-15s & other guns on facebook), making sure people with restraining orders against them (deemed as a threat to their spouse/girlfriend) have weapons removed from them etc.
2344 2018-03-25 02:50:45 Uhhhh your in Vegas.. the whole city is what stocks wishes it is
2345 2018-03-25 02:50:40 It's good for u! I hope there r any stocks 
2346 2018-03-25 02:49:47 Think the bar stocks salty, salty grits?
2347 2018-03-25 02:49:13 I like that, it's probably from back when humans traded stocks in fractions
2348 2018-03-25 02:49:04 Lol. So the trump walls been built? Pp defunded?  Deficits reduced?  Fun stocks banned. Immigration solved, etc?  It’s more than just this one error. This is why maga folks shouldnt be allowed to vote ever again. But cult away
2349 2018-03-25 02:48:49 中村悠一のオタクの顔して腕組んでる
2350 2018-03-25 02:48:20 That wou ld be wild...almost like the stocks that you save someone from in Legend of the Red Dragon, only to be imprisoned in them because of it.
2351 2018-03-25 02:47:45 Bump stocks jam rifles. There is a certain period of time it takes for the reloading mechanism in a gun to go through 1 cycle. Trying to forcefully speed the process up jams the gun. If you want to shoot fast, learn to pull the trigger faster.
2352 2018-03-25 02:47:44 NRA blocks common sense gun laws like banning bump stocks and AR-15's, like banning large magazines, like universal background checks. YOU KNOW THIS fact as well as I do. Yeah, funny thing these shooters can GET this equipment...isn't it. REAL EFFIN' FUNNY. Please.
2353 2018-03-25 02:46:41 Ask anyone with AR15 knowledge and they’ll tell you bump stocks are gimmick crap! Most civilian ARs don’t have a barrel or receiver capable of handling extremely fast rates of fire!
2354 2018-03-25 02:46:34 I bought all the stocks at 25$ a piece,move all my shares to China,two years later 5 officers attack me n build a fake case on me in a hospital room before taking me to county,sounds like a Kingpin charge but I ain't the smartest man in the world..
2355 2018-03-25 02:45:46 M-14 was our best rifle, only FN FAL rivals it. And it has made a comeback, with rifles mothballed for decades reconditioned with M-4 type stocks and rails to counter Dragunov sniper rifles in the sandbox. My perfect squad blend would have at least 2 designated marksmen w/M-14's.
2356 2018-03-25 02:44:37 IT IS UNBELIEVABLE how the sentiments of the bears suddenly sound bullish on the anti bacterial/anti fungal stocks. I’ve been talking about the superbug crisis for actual YEARS. Felt like Michael Burry loading on this companies with no volume and getting roasted for it.
2357 2018-03-25 02:44:31 If assault weapons were banned, would bump stocks (?) be a moot issue? 
@FBR
2358 2018-03-25 02:43:11 It really makes me wonder who you are looking out for. Are you representing me? I'm not sure, please convince me you can apply sensible gun regulations by making bump stocks and assault style weapons illegal, implementation of a temporary removal of someone's weapons if they 1/2
2359 2018-03-25 02:41:25 It goes into effect next century, bans gun with scary moving stocks and child killing grips
2360 2018-03-25 02:41:19 The NRA recommended the banning of bump stocks after the mass murder in LV. Bump stocks have been used in only one incident, so it will have absolutely no effect upon gun violence. Criminals don't abide by laws & inner city gun violence is almost always with illegal guns.
2361 2018-03-25 02:40:49 Bump stocks are not good

2365 2018-03-25 02:39:40 The Republicans would be all over the FAA if it did that. Ridiculous how they don't want to do anything about gun control other than perhaps end bum stocks, and even that is only a maybe for Congressional GOP members. Yet they want to regulate women's health....smh
2366 2018-03-25 02:38:37 Obama didn’t legalize Bump Stocks 
2367 2018-03-25 02:37:54 Can you tweet anything without telling a lie. Please show us the bill where bump stocks were made legal.
2368 2018-03-25 02:37:13 Most of them have no more clue what bump stocks are than know what "assault rifles" are. Sheep.
2369 2018-03-25 02:37:05 Planned Parenthood = Funded,
Science and Research = Budget Increase
Education = Budget Increase
ICE Detention Centers Increase = NOPE!

Thank you Chuck and Nancy, (aka Paul and Mitchy)
Next, say goodbye to your Bump Stocks.... :)
2370 2018-03-25 02:36:55 No. The current law prohibited Obama's administration from regulating bump stocks. Obama issued a lot of executive orders on stricter gun control, which Trump has been rolling back, including measure that prevented people with mental illness buying guns.
2371 2018-03-25 02:36:12 @Emma4Change have you ever went back a few years when Obama legalized bump stocks? That’s where it started but you blame President Trump. You are pawns for the Dems. They had every chance to fix this. Obama had the most School shootings in history. Start there
2372 2018-03-25 02:35:23 bitcoin and my other stocks pissin me off 
2373 2018-03-25 02:34:59 .@Blackrock Use your vast investment in gun manufacturers to curb gun violence. Demand over 21 age req, require a 10 day waiting time, stop selling bump stocks & high cap. magazines. #YouFundGuns
2374 2018-03-25 02:33:37 I’m sure the criminals are already planning to not use illegal bump stocks.

2377 2018-03-25 02:33:02 Fair Play; however one of the things that frustrates me about the convo on GC is that most have no solution palletable to the current interpretation of heller and the 2nd. It’s easy to ban bump stocks, but other ideas tend cross the line among gun owners.
2378 2018-03-25 02:33:00 Bump stocks are going to be illegal soon.... when he was talking about due process he was referencing Nickolas Cruz bc he was mentally ill and out of control.
2379 2018-03-25 02:32:53 Friendly reminder trump is trying to take your bump stocks away and wants to raise the age to purchase a rifle
2380 2018-03-25 02:32:48 Trump bans bump stocks because they suck. #goclass3
2381 2018-03-25 02:32:39 OH BS No one wants to take all your damn guns. This crap lie has gone around since I was a teen. Banning an ar15 , making magazine clips not be able to carry so damn much, ban bump stocks and tougher testing and background checks every so many years (just like a drivers license.)
2382 2018-03-25 02:32:36 Virginia tech biggest school shooting done with pistol! Bump stocks getting banned. Doesn’t matter what gun it is, it’s a people problem.
2383 2018-03-25 02:31:54 "Many" were also marching not for a "gun ban", but simply for sensible reform: universal background checks, closing "gun show loophole", elimination of high capacity magazines & bump stocks, 21 years old to purchase, harder for those w/ mental illness to purchase. DO SOMETHING!
2384 2018-03-25 02:31:52 Banning bump stocks will do nothing to prevent killers. Banning such items is only incremental removal of our rights.
2385 2018-03-25 02:30:19 Every bullet can kill. Banning bump stocks is not enough, you have to ban guns. The 2nd Amendment was drafted over 200 years ago..time to change the laws. But as the puppet of the #NRA you don’t have the balls for it. I guess USA will have to wait for 46. #March4OurLives
2386 2018-03-25 02:30:02 If u want things to change you can't be confirmable with the past (Obama), Trump has already signed an order against bump stocks. All Im saying is obama did little to change anything. Good for peps who r standing up for what they support. Doesn't change Obama's lack of involment
2387 2018-03-25 02:29:46 Are you ever gonna bring back the stocks channel? #AskBigT
2388 2018-03-25 02:29:35 Would you ever consider doing a new series based on stocks? Giving advice or answering questions for beginners! #AskBigT
2389 2018-03-25 02:29:26 Unfortunately, too many youth are believing this doctrine. And they don't just want bump stocks banned, they want no #2A. That's their end game. Very naive, but very dangerous game. #SaveOurRepublic
2390 2018-03-25 02:28:55 One of the speakers talked about if they ban bump stocks, they'll ask for more and more.  It's easy to see where this would go.  It's why the NRA cannot compromise.  Those brats don't want compromise.
2391 2018-03-25 02:28:52 Also remember we largely underperformed compared to global markets till date in 2018. But i also noticed that many stocks recovered well from their lows on Friday. I sincearly feel that recovery will be fast, when ever that happens
2392 2018-03-25 02:28:17 Banning bump stocks is just "low hanging fruit" for politicians but it's a start for more gun safety. This is a complex issue, not a binary one. Be a part of the solution and contribute something more rational.
2393 2018-03-25 02:27:58 Trump is also implementing bans of his own. He’s gonna ban bump stocks and wants to raise the age to get a gun to 21. I hate him too but he’s wanting to help in that.
2394 2018-03-25 02:27:44 Buy gun stocks?
2395 2018-03-25 02:27:30 Wait until all the Mutual Funds start unloading their gun manufacturers’ stocks.
2396 2018-03-25 02:27:16 Okay Reed giving you the benefit of the doubt.Can ARs carry magazines above ten. Are AR bullets more damaging then a regular handgun to ones body Please don’t tell me about exceptions normal guns. Are handguns as accurate. Do bump stocks banned today turn regular rifles into Semi

2398 2018-03-25 02:26:34 I can bump-fire my AR without a bump stock. The NRA bending over in front of Trump on bump stocks is still the NRA signing off on a slippery slope.
2399 2018-03-25 02:26:14 How do you pick your stocks to focus/add to your trading list?
2400 2018-03-25 02:25:52 Training and education. Let’s see who follows and pitches in (maybe we’re able to expand the conversation) and see where it goes.
Back to resource stocks. 
2/2
2401 2018-03-25 02:25:26 Obama did not legalize bump stocks!  You are POTUS now & need to protect our kids! Demand that congress establish laws that require universal background checks, ban bump stocks & automatic weapons.  Also provide money ASAP to all schools for metal detectors!
2402 2018-03-25 02:25:01 Strengthen background checks
Ban high capacity magazines
Ban bump stocks
Restrict “Assault Weapons”
Promote SMART guns
”Safe Storage” laws

#MarchForOurLives  
2403 2018-03-25 02:24:48 No long position in $SPY. Currently long many stocks and a $SPY hedge. Just a comment on that charts technicals. I use that setup often when starting new long positions.
2404 2018-03-25 02:24:06 NO MORE ASSAULT WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION! BAN AR-15s, Bump Stocks and military weapons from individuals. We understand some people have pistols and rifles for target practice or even for hunting for food. ASSAULT WEAPONS are for KILLING MASSES. No More assault weapons.
2405 2018-03-25 02:23:43 They also okayed bump stocks.
2406 2018-03-25 02:23:38 "Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA." Yeah, this is another lie.
2407 2018-03-25 02:23:24 .@realDonaldTrump 

(3) Your supporters - those who voted you into office to #MAGA - are not asking you to ban stupid bump stocks. You’re only going to lose votes by doing this. Bump stocks are NOT the problem. You know that. Let’s ban PC instead.
2408 2018-03-25 02:23:13 I use what you teach us for other stocks.  That’s why I love to follow you
2409 2018-03-25 02:23:06 #hodl stocks
2410 2018-03-25 02:22:41 Whelp......

For:

1) raising age limit
2) outlawing assault style weapons and bump stocks
3) smaller magazines 
4) higher taxes on ammo
5) background checks that work
2411 2018-03-25 02:22:39 @realDonaldTrump I don't understand with all the great things you are doing, how can my 401K be taking a nose dive? Are the stocks reacting to fake news? If so, that seems wrong to me.
2412 2018-03-25 02:22:31 Its not an infringement of the 2nd amendment,  which did not include semi automatic rifles & bump stocks or military grade weapons which are used by today's military forces. And some of which the public obviously wants their hands on.
2413 2018-03-25 02:22:16 Btw, no one wants to prevent you from bearing arms, so long as you are not dangerous or a criminal. We want universal background checks and a ban on similar-automatic weapons, large capacity clips and bump stocks. You can have any non military arms you want...
2414 2018-03-25 02:21:49 Gun Control does not mean taking away your guns, Pastor. It means background checks, Banning bump stocks an regulating access to assault weapons.
2415 2018-03-25 02:21:43 Yes, you could throw a larger magazine in a deer rifle, or carry extra clips. But that just goes back to that I believe high capacity magazine, bump stocks, and semi autos really have no right being in the hands of a standard civilian. You can still hunt and shoot without either.
2416 2018-03-25 02:21:33 I believe the driving force for the next parabolic increase will be a stock market and bond market crash due partially to higher interest rates. Get a couple big institutional investors to move from stocks to crypto and others will follow. Hopefully Q3 or Q4
2417 2018-03-25 02:21:24 Why did president Obama legalize bump stocks?????????
2418 2018-03-25 02:20:52 We never said take away all guns. Why do all you republicans say that?  We want common sense laws...one being to outlaw assault rifles, bump stocks, etc.
2419 2018-03-25 02:20:26 Why did Obama legalize bump stocks??????
2420 2018-03-25 02:20:19 In theory I don't even care about banning bump stocks, but the statement here is the reason I'm opposed to banning them.
2421 2018-03-25 02:20:08 You were in and out of certain stocks very quick.  Do you mostly scalp or swing?
2422 2018-03-25 02:19:39 Do the right thing! Quit taking 3 million dollars from the NRA. Ban assault weapons and bump stocks. Do better back ground checks. All of you in Congress are nothing but cowards! Money is more important than the children!
2423 2018-03-25 02:19:14 Conversion kits.
Bump stocks.
2424 2018-03-25 02:19:05 Me: okay, I should buy some stocks/insurance for investment.
Also me: wow, that merch looks so damn fine I must have it. Investment can wait but this merch is selling out soon. 

Me after buying the merch: wth am i doing with my life 
2425 2018-03-25 02:19:03 Why did Obama legalize bump stocks???????
2426 2018-03-25 02:18:22 I think @POTUS making it illegal for bump stocks is a good start! Still need to look at tougher back ground checks! I’m all for 2nd amendment but we have to do something to protect our children! Not sure why they were ever legal in the first place!
2427 2018-03-25 02:17:29 What should be banned? Well assault rifles are (for the most part) and that’s how it should be. Bump stocks should go. Let’s see.
2428 2018-03-25 02:17:07 .@realDonaldTrump 3 things about your hair-brained idea to ban bump stocks: 

(1) They’re winning the gun debate, with the help of the #FakeNewsMedia. Why give them another win for ZERO benefit. Banning them will do NOTHING. You’re playing into the PC b.s. you always talk about.
2429 2018-03-25 02:16:39 I don’t think these children were marching to ban bump stocks. That’s already taken care of. Nice try though.
2430 2018-03-25 02:16:13 How about regulations for all semi auto? Regulations for conversion kits? Regulations for bump stocks? Regulations for buying age? Regulations on “collectors”? Regulations on caliber? I could go on. How about regulations of firearms that are based off of military firearms-AR-15.
2431 2018-03-25 02:15:35 I said semi auto weapons..not automatic. I said "not to mention auto". Semi should be regulated like auto is, and auto should be fully outlawed including bump stocks and trigger cranks that make them essentially auto. Semis should be limited to a 10 round fixed clip magazine.
2432 2018-03-25 02:14:59 David another tactic would be to encourage investors in gun stocks to sell their positions.... If gun manufacturers loose market cap, gun production gets tougher..
2433 2018-03-25 02:14:46 @ECHO_USA have been considering your 56 volt push mower, but no one stocks them. Not even @HomeDepot. I have your gas powered weed trimmer &  blower. Was hoping to keep it in the family. Oh well. Guess it’s @EGOPowerPlus or @STIHLUSA
2434 2018-03-25 02:14:39 Las Vegas shooter had bump stocks. 

I said that to make sure I was including any type of accessory that does the same as a bump stock that I may not know the name of.
2435 2018-03-25 02:13:56 The AR-15 isn't an assault rifle.  Bump stocks aren't necessary, but the AR-15 alone is pretty hard to mod into an assault rifle.
2436 2018-03-25 02:13:36 Why did Obama legalize bump stocks??????????
2437 2018-03-25 02:12:13 At sharp 8 AM starting Analysis for #Niftyfuture #BankNifty #stocks #commodity #GlobalMarkets #Forex

Will take 3 hrs plus
2438 2018-03-25 02:12:02 Isn’t he the one that made bump stocks legal to purchase? Oh yeah.
2439 2018-03-25 02:11:46 They need to unload their garbage onto someone... the taxpayer gets stuck with it every time whether you buy stocks or not...
2440 2018-03-25 02:11:40 @DIANEVANN14 They are only asking to enforce the laws that are already on the books. Trump has gotten rid of the bump stocks like he said he would The system failed not guns at Parkland but people who read highlights only and can't think for themselves will never see that.
2441 2018-03-25 02:11:33 Why did Obama legalize bump stocks??????????????
2442 2018-03-25 02:10:58 Not necessarily, No AR-15 style rifles were used in Columbine or Virginia Tech. Also, there are no bump-stock type accessories, only bump stocks, which were not used in Parkland. Also, you can bump fire (the same thing a bump stock does) with your belt loop.
2443 2018-03-25 02:10:45 Thanks so much for sharing your wisdom. Which stocks would you buy for the reversal or options only is something you would recommend for the remainder of the year ... if so which ones are the best   Thanks!
2444 2018-03-25 02:10:29 You do know that Jeff sessions and Donald Trump just moved to ban the sale of bump stocks, don't you, troll?
2445 2018-03-25 02:10:06 Well technically the AR-15 can be used for hunting or sporting purposes. Bump stocks have no practical purpose beyond crime. Nobody needs full auto. Full auto was banned in the 30s since they only people using automatic weapons were crooks.
2446 2018-03-25 02:09:41 He legalized bump stocks
2447 2018-03-25 02:09:36 @realDonaldTrump my wife says bump stocks you can keep them they don’t fit in her purse
2448 2018-03-25 02:09:34 Since when did “bump stocks” make a weapon fire like a full auto???
2449 2018-03-25 02:09:26 He just approved bump stocks...that whole vegas killing last year..yeah, approved under obama..

but he helped protect!! lol 

liberalism..lol
2450 2018-03-25 02:09:14 Bump stocks don't make a semi auto a full auto you can bump fire a semi auto without a stock someone is giving you fake information and you are eating it up and angering your base.  If you are tired of being President feel free to step down you have done some good things
2451 2018-03-25 02:09:10 BHO legalized bump stocks, fact. What do you think?
2452 2018-03-25 02:09:06 America has spoken. Bump stocks is not enough. More gun laws!  #MarchForOurLives #NRABloodmoney #GunReformNow #GOP
2453 2018-03-25 02:09:02 Because Paul Ryan and  McConnell are crooks! Lets not forget Biden using his son because his son can't be investigated! Obama did a stock Mkt deal w/China and made lots of money by playing the system and w/his words made the stocks drop 3.00 then said he change his mine up  $100
2454 2018-03-25 02:08:57 And who allowed bump stocks in the first place? 
2455 2018-03-25 02:08:33 The new spending bill was said to have ended bump stocks & stiffened background checks! Not sure what the stiffened background checks are specifically. I guess will find out!
2456 2018-03-25 02:08:02 Are your stocks down? Go see some cherry blossom or something.
2457 2018-03-25 02:07:53 The NRA doesn’t just block the government from regulating bump stocks, they protect the 2nd amendment if the constitution in all ways. I think that’s very important
2458 2018-03-25 02:07:37 I was wondering why my Taser stocks were doing so well lately?
2459 2018-03-25 02:07:33 Know why you can’t go out and buy a Tommy Gun, Senator?  Why can’t you buy a bazooka, a silencer, a mortar, or an M-14? Because they are classified under Federal Law as weapons that do not belong in our society.  Time to add the AR-15 and bump stocks.  Grow a pair! #NeverAgain
2460 2018-03-25 02:07:31 Instead of stops, consider using options to define risk. With put protection, my long holdings have suffered little loss, allowing me to quickly flip to net short still holding stocks long & also outright short the markets successfully in recent downturns.
2461 2018-03-25 02:07:24 Tracking how like GPS or something?and as far as "outlawed" right now with out proper license it is illegal to possess short barreled shotguns,pistols with rifle stocks fully automatic weapons and destructive devises. Anything else would move into hunting and sporting.
2462 2018-03-25 02:07:16 The laws don't deter true criminals, you are correct. However, the point is to codify the consequences of said illegal actions, and - more importantly - deter those who are just considering that path. In the case of banning bump stocks and the like, it limits the damage.
2463 2018-03-25 02:06:40 You are either grossly misinformed or lying. The Obama administration did NOT "legalize" bump stocks. That was GOP Congress' job and they refused. You have rolled back Obama era controls. Blood is on your hands.
2464 2018-03-25 02:06:09 Prove that the previous President approved bump stocks with a GOP control congress. Prove it!
2465 2018-03-25 02:05:59 I think they are clogging the “personal care” isle about now..forcing stocks in adult underwear to go up..
2466 2018-03-25 02:05:04 Two of my children marched today. I was raised to respect guns. I have fired guns before. I have been on weapons ranges. Reform is necessary. The time is Now. Enough is Enough. There is no need for assault riffles or bump stocks. None.
2467 2018-03-25 02:04:55 I’m not saying you can’t have a gun. I’m just saying, universal background checks so that not one more lunatic EASILY gets their hands on an assault rifle, BANNING assault rifles & bump stocks bc absolutely NO ONE just “needs one.” we’re not trying to “take your guns”
2468 2018-03-25 02:04:16 98% of gun deaths are from handguns yet you're going after AR-15s?  Bump-stocks have been in a grand total of 1 crime yet you're going after those?  The Supreme Court has precedents on the 2nd amendment for individuals not just a militia, genius.  LMAO!!!!!!!!!!
2469 2018-03-25 02:01:32 Why did Obama legalize bump stocks??????????
2470 2018-03-25 02:01:18 How do you hedge a portfolio of stocks with options in a down market like last week. Index option or stock option? And how much to buy.
2471 2018-03-25 02:01:13 Well you see that won’t work because they are clearly not trying that they want to abolish the NRA make ar15s illegal take guns out of good people hands and reduce our freedom we need more background checks that all not banning bump stocks and age requirements background checksss
2472 2018-03-25 02:00:26 Not necessarily. We can ban bump stocks from being sold and manufactured and make it so that people with multiple felonies can’t carry concealed fire arms in any state. Non of these reasonable regulations would affect the normal naw abiding citizens.
2473 2018-03-25 01:59:22 As a "constitutional conservative," do bump stocks fall under Scalia's interpretation of the second amendment from his Heller vs DC opinion?
2474 2018-03-25 01:59:18 I agree bump stocks should be banned, but this fact is about how you are marching against all semi automatic guns, including pistols, which are used for self defense. The reality is, more guns in the hands of law abiding citizens= less crime. That’s a fact
2475 2018-03-25 01:58:38 The President? Really? How many school shootings happened in 8 yrs under Obama, & he still approved bump stocks. Trump banned them. So tell me How is Trump standing in the way? U r nothing but a political liar, full of s..t. All Talk but no action, that’s all u r. Get real.
2476 2018-03-25 01:58:02 "A well regulated Militia", being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed. From From Muskets to AR 15's, times have changed, I don't think our founding fathers meant for access for all to those, bump stocks
2477 2018-03-25 01:57:58 I just saw that Obama legalized Bump Stocks? You gotta be kidding me! And he did nothing after Sandy Hook. Why his Administration gets the pass on all of this is beyond ridiculous. #stopschoolviolance
2478 2018-03-25 01:57:46 No hate telling the truth. Wasn't it the Obama administration that made bump stocks legal? Now at least Trump is making them illegal. But we all must do more.
2479 2018-03-25 01:56:57 We remember your approval of bump stocks to convert guns to high powered rifles.
2480 2018-03-25 01:56:36 @jefffultz congrats you came a long way from shadybowl I raced with with in mini stocks at the bowl
2481 2018-03-25 01:55:34 How are you going to save lives?  Banning bump stocks?  Banning ARs?  The weapons that will be used on the next 2 mass shootings have already been acquired.  Until you find a way to eliminate evil, people will kill with guns, knives, clubs, rocks...#MarchForOurLives
2482 2018-03-25 01:54:52 And if you knew anything about bump fire stocks you would know they are damn near impossible to Keep On Target while shooting them
2483 2018-03-25 01:53:47 "Trump enacted ban on bump stocks..." only after overturning every piece of gun legislation Obama had passed. Obama tried passing bump stock ban & GOP majority wouldn't pass it- go figure. So he nor his GOP don't care, only passed to boast they did something.
2484 2018-03-25 01:53:01 You can enjoy game and shooting without bump stocks, extended mags, semi automatic rifles or pistols.
2485 2018-03-25 01:52:46 VC is taking big risky bets. Public stocks is safer bets
2486 2018-03-25 01:52:42 Slide Fire and Bump Stocks both change that for less than $50. Both are legal. Taking up for AR-15s doesn't change them being the go to for Mass Shootings.
2487 2018-03-25 01:52:26 Why did Obama legalize bump stocks?????????
2488 2018-03-25 01:52:23 1) I didn't vote for obama. 2) He isn't the president. 3) Bump stocks are not yet illegal.
2489 2018-03-25 01:52:17 Betty as far as I know Donald Trump is only in the process of banning gun stocks and a few orher safety measures.He's now not going for upping the age to 21 nor is he looking at banning all the war guns available !! People don't NEED these types of weapons !
2490 2018-03-25 01:51:44 Apparently it was somewhat close, got em down to 4 stocks
2491 2018-03-25 01:51:24 @tedcruz @JohnCornyn @realDonaldTrump just because we aren’t in the streets protesting doesn’t mean we want our gun rights stripped. #2A is to protect us from a tyrannical govt, I have the right to bare arms (and bump stocks) stand firm for the silent majority.
2492 2018-03-25 01:51:22 Pump and dump coming! These stocks are on the OTC for a reason!!!  They are scams. From I pump and fake PR to the other ! Their profits won't be nearly as much as they say.   It's a scam.   No insider buys.  Last 6 trades were all sells on the pump and dump. Your  a paid pumper
2493 2018-03-25 01:50:31 Please suggest atleat two stocks to buy
2494 2018-03-25 01:50:16 Do some research. POTUS has already banned bump stocks. We can't blame the NRA when we have laws and they aren't being enforced. How will more laws help until we enforce the ones we have? Mental health is the main issue here.
2495 2018-03-25 01:49:26 I'm really trying to understand your logic.  Seems like you take pleasure in the downs more than the ups of this market.  Have you ever invested in stocks?  Do you ever see the same patterns?  NOTHING ever goes up every single day.  It's called progressive growth.
2496 2018-03-25 01:49:13 Why are they being so anti-Trump??? He is not the cause of their problems. He is actually trying to do what they want by trying to pass more gun laws. He did ban bump stocks.
2497 2018-03-25 01:49:08 Bump stocks DO NOT turn semiautomatic into an automatic it simulates it at best! You can use a thumb in the belt loop and do the same thing essentially. Should we ban belt loops too? I support you POTUS, but touting the liberal lines is getting you nowhere. #MAGA #Qanon
2498 2018-03-25 01:49:03 Finally got to play The Last Spike from @ColumbiaGames tonight. It was better than I thought it would be. Fast, tight, clever, and a great intro to stocks/route building. Thanks to @TheGameBoyGeek for the intro.
2499 2018-03-25 01:48:50 Do you even know what a semi automatic is? They won't get rid of anything but bump stocks.
2500 2018-03-25 01:48:35 Stocks in Medicare have skyrocketed by 300%
2501 2018-03-25 01:48:31 Another Trump lie. You had every chance to ban bump stocks after the Vegas shooting and instead bent over and pulled your pants down for the NRA. #TrumpLiesMatter
2502 2018-03-25 01:47:50 What is the concern here? That you won't be able to buy bump stocks or AR15s?
2503 2018-03-25 01:47:36 Did you know that Obama legalized Bump Stocks?  Did you know AR -15 is not an Assault Weapon.  2 things I learned today.
2504 2018-03-25 01:47:32 @PatrickForCO ARM TEACHERS!!! Guess you and several others own STOCKS in gun profits. Guess you would like AR 15's in classrooms.
2505 2018-03-25 01:47:25 NRA freaks.  You can’t even support banning bump stocks.   And you blame a Parkland student?
2506 2018-03-25 01:46:54 Weren’t bump stocks legalized in 2010? Not long after taking office. Also, the most mass shootings took place during 2009- 2016. Nothing was changed. Didn’t make assault rifles illegal. Now, you’re onboard? All talk for 8 years and still are.
2507 2018-03-25 01:46:46 With Uber's horrible 2017, Facebook's data theft(Cambridge analytica),Snapchat's tumbling stocks etc. Do you believe the honeymoon period for the tech industry is over? Has the tech industry become too big and arrogant? Aura around tech companies is a negative one now #askMKBHD
2508 2018-03-25 01:45:48 So if we're gonna ban "bump stocks" because we now recognize it's bad to turn regular guns into "assault rifles"....what's the logic in not banning the actual assault rifles themselves?
2509 2018-03-25 01:45:20 Maybe they are tired of being nice as the NRA stooges do nothing... Where is the congressional bill to ban bump stocks.. Or universal background checks.. Oh no where to be found. I guess they get to sit on their thumbs.
2510 2018-03-25 01:45:06 You helped to legal bump stocks.  And you screwed my health insurance.  Thank God you are no longer President.
2511 2018-03-25 01:43:46 Thoughtful words? What did Obama do for u except approve Bump Stocks when Trump banned them. Action speaks louder than words. Get a brain for yourself.
2512 2018-03-25 01:43:24 As long as you know I own guns too so adhere to 2nd but think bump stocks is a good start
2513 2018-03-25 01:43:14 I know I'm not Jack but I'd like to give my two cents. I agree that the way we talk about guns needs to change. As for laws I think they are mostly good the way they are and there should be a ban on bump stocks.
2514 2018-03-25 01:42:25 .@GOP The 2nd A isn't under attack. Your right to own a gun isn't under attack. No 1 wants 2 erase the 2nd A. Nearly 80% of Americans r asking 4 sensible laws: no assault weapons, no bump stocks, better background checks, longer waiting times, history of violence = NO guns,
2515 2018-03-25 01:41:52 I stopped watching after vinnie took like 8 stocks as the lead off
2516 2018-03-25 01:41:46 We need a multi-pronged approach. Banning Military Assault Weapons, Bump Stocks and Multiple Round Clips that hold more than 10 rounds.
2517 2018-03-25 01:41:42 So when taking away AR-15’s, bump stocks, etc doesn’t have the effect that the Dems promised to their sheep then they will do what? Come back for more and then more and more. Reminder: Chicago, Baltimore, etc have the toughest gun laws in the country and still the most murders.
2518 2018-03-25 01:41:40 Obama didn’t legalize bump stocks! The ATF simply acknowledged that they had no authority under the law to regulate them, and Obama actually respected that rule of law! So stop lying, Trumpy.
2519 2018-03-25 01:41:28 I fully support the second amendment but bump stocks turn a semi-automatic weapon into what is basically an automatic weapon. Not sure that bump stocks even qualify into Scalia's definition of 2A.
2520 2018-03-25 01:40:49 @RepBrianMast  NRA staff is fighting for their lucrative positions. If Dana Loesch is paid at least 400K annually what does Lapierre earn? Gov. Scott financially incentivized manufactories for AK40(when sanctions on Russia) and AR15's . On Feb.14 what value were his gun STOCKS?
2521 2018-03-25 01:40:45 May I ask? They are real couple or kinda media play because comeback or something relate to increasing stocks?
2522 2018-03-25 01:40:04 Then close the gun show loophole. Funny that no one has submitted that. Background checks are being made better with the omnibus bill. Bump stocks are now illegal. Consider the problem solved?
2523 2018-03-25 01:40:00 This is a lie. Obama tried to make non-mech bump-stocks illegal, but the Republican Congress would not let him.
2524 2018-03-25 01:39:14 Obama Administration did not legalize bump stocks.
2525 2018-03-25 01:38:45 Obama backed 'Bump Stocks' into legalized category, Trump took them away quickly.
2526 2018-03-25 01:38:37 Absolutely agree with that. I'm a staunch constitutionalist and second amendment supporter, but I don't see why of bump stocks or extra capacity magazines should be legal. Either way this is a legislative responsibility.
2527 2018-03-25 01:38:23 If you provided the willing civilian market for military-grade armament, high-magazine clips, and bump stocks... you are culpable. Gun companies wouldn’t sell assault rifles if nobody was buying them. If you think hunting is a sport, buy a crossbow. #NeverAgain #MarchForOurLives
2528 2018-03-25 01:38:03 Forex never clicked for me and I liked that before stocks and options.
2529 2018-03-25 01:37:22 You do know the NRA is against bump stocks, right?
2530 2018-03-25 01:37:17 Tiens tous mes stocks disponible (bah grand vhose mais c'est l'intention qui compte)
2531 2018-03-25 01:37:16 When you can stop blaming and come together as a nation , progress may be made , a ban on assault rifles and bump stocks is not taking away your right to bear arms, and having a stricter background checks is in line with mental health
2532 2018-03-25 01:37:01 Technically nobody legalized bump stocks. A POTUS should know better than to distort fact to his people. #YouAreACorruptPOTUS #HowCanYouTellHeIsLying #HisLipsAreMoving
2533 2018-03-25 01:37:00 Proud American gun owner but I think bump stocks are not needed except in Military Ops
2534 2018-03-25 01:36:42 It was typical convoluted law, it limited the military style equipment, folding stocks, pistol grips, bayonet mounts or flash suppressors etc. The weapon could only have one or two of these upgrades. Mostly didn't want them being able to be broken down & concealed.
2535 2018-03-25 01:35:55 Why did Obama legalize Bump Stocks? What was his motivation?
2536 2018-03-25 01:35:50 Wrong.

Was banning bump stocks not good enough for you people?
2537 2018-03-25 01:35:45 Obama COULD NOT regulate the bump stocks of the time as they didn't fit the definition of a firearm. Newer bump stocks have the mechanical parts to make it a firearm. They should have never been allowed to exist!
2538 2018-03-25 01:34:57 what rights would be taken away by limiting bump stocks?
was the march about getting rid of all guns so we can’t have a “well regulated militia” ?
are all of our rights unlimited and without any regulations whatsoever?
even the 1st amendment has limits
2539 2018-03-25 01:32:40 No stocks but plenty of racing I scroll past the political crap not for weekends
2540 2018-03-25 01:32:28 He also okayed the bump stocks!
2541 2018-03-25 01:32:13 Contrary to individual stocks, my 401K lost 5% last week. Individuals don't gain or lose until they sell. I can't control what my fund mgrs do, so I just have to hope it recovers, and doesn't keep sliding. 
Still wondering how much total 401 losses were last week?
2542 2018-03-25 01:32:12 And bump stocks!!
2543 2018-03-25 01:32:03 Those features are 
-pistol grips
-adjustable stocks
-folding stocks
-threaded barrel
-bayonet lug
-forward hand grip
-flash hider

Now, do any of these features actually affect a weapons lethality?? FUCK NO.  And if you had any conception of how firearms worked you'd know this
2544 2018-03-25 01:31:15 With all due respect, Michael, what is the need for bump stocks?
2545 2018-03-25 01:30:56 No your avoiding the question. Also you just spout bullshit thinking it helps your point but just makes it confusing. Your going off about bump stocks and money and avoiding the point that it's guns killing these kids...
2546 2018-03-25 01:30:50 Hard watching some of these 4 stocks.
2547 2018-03-25 01:30:48 Look, Josh, the Republicans are never going to impeach him. The best thing we can do until 2020 is to make him miserable. No wall, trade war tanks stocks, Stormy nips at his pasty backside every other day. I predict he'll bail.
2548 2018-03-25 01:30:31 As for bump stocks, I see the point and the reason people fear them. But I don’t think everything said about them is true. They also make the shot very inaccurate which is why they aren’t really used, I presume.  Ppl are just trying to make things scarier, IMO
2549 2018-03-25 01:30:28 Bad idea, doesnt fix anything as bad guys will still get bump stocks.  You are smarter than this!  The rest of your ideas are great!  More laws wont fix the gun issues.
2550 2018-03-25 01:30:15 U know your mums an angel when she stocks the house with all your favourite snacks for your arrival
2551 2018-03-25 01:30:12 Bingo! Gun owner here, but you’ve gone too far! Gun law reform is long overdue. Ban hi-capacity magazines, bump stocks, universal background checks, ban military assault style weapons, licensure, insurance, mandated training & be part of a well-regulated militia. #NeverAgain
2552 2018-03-25 01:29:54 They demanded bump stocks be banned. They are banned. Now the bump stock ban is "meaningless."
See how this works?
2553 2018-03-25 01:28:56 Easy way to fix the problem is throw every single member of the GOP out of office unless they support a ban on assault weapons, a ban on bump stocks, universal background checks for everyone and no gun until check is complete and clear and a limit on clip size.  Join us or lose.
2554 2018-03-25 01:28:48 Well technically stocks were going down while crypto was going up. We’ll see what happens Monday when stock market reopens should be interesting. Mewn or dewm
2555 2018-03-25 01:28:03 The "rate of fire for civilian firearms is totally dependent on how fast you can pull the trigger. That is how bump stocks work. You pull the trigger once but the bump stock uses the recoil of the weapon to help you "pull the trigger" many times.
2556 2018-03-25 01:27:38 Just sitting here waiting for the Fed to raise rates, the #recession to begin, and the money to flood to #Commodities such as #Bitcoin.

#crypto #cryptocurrency #Altcoins #blockchain #Blockchain #stocks #money #gold #
2557 2018-03-25 01:27:02 Do you invest in any stocks?
2558 2018-03-25 01:25:18 The #NRA values gun money more than it values the lives of American children. They are not interested in any gun reforms, not even outlawing bump stocks.

We must make politicians more afraid of being voted out of office than they are of losing NRA money. #MarchForOurLives
2559 2018-03-25 01:24:07 3. No bump stocks or silencers.

4. Every weapon manufactured or imported to the Union is registered in an Union-wide database. Every sale is registered. The rifing of each gun is registered.
2560 2018-03-25 01:23:57 First off I'm not a little kid. However you act like one. If you are a "real" teacher you would not pump stocks, you would show and teach your students how stocks move organically, what happens when institutional buyers come in. Instead you speak garbage.
2561 2018-03-25 01:23:54 The ATF changed the rules. Guess he could have used an EO like Trump, to ban bump stocks, and have it overturned by the courts.

Obama asked for comprehensive gun laws. Republicans and the NRA said he was trying to ban guns.
2562 2018-03-25 01:23:25 @sream93 @thinkingwisely no never fight stocks on uptrend or breakout
2563 2018-03-25 01:23:15 Bat out of stocks yung Lhinzy  san ba meron
2564 2018-03-25 01:22:53 None of our rights are absolutely by any means, so I’m not really sure why some of y’all think the 2nd amendment means u get to own assault rifles and bump stocks unchecked/unregulated
2565 2018-03-25 01:22:06 I doubt that you're a gun owner, responsible or otherwise.
Nothing I said was beyond the basic Tennant of the 2nd amendment.
Nothing I said pertains to automatic weapons, bump stocks or ANYTHING  controversial.
Please re-read my comments, moron.
2566 2018-03-25 01:21:58 Bump stocks.

That's just the start, dear.
2567 2018-03-25 01:21:07 he took 3 stocks total across both of the full sets
2568 2018-03-25 01:20:29 AR-types can use large magazines and bump stocks which are much faster than a hand-gun.
2569 2018-03-25 01:18:30 Bump stocks should be illegal as well as anything that can increase the fire rate of any gun. Extended magazines should be illegal as well. Grips are fine as well as flashlights for home defense.
2570 2018-03-25 01:18:22 Ive heard him out and yet he does not get it. I will try however. There has not been a tyranny for how many 100 years. Banning an Ar15, no more bump stocks, Make magazines where it holds less ammo. I am a gun owner and I see no issue with this,
2571 2018-03-25 01:18:17 Might want to get better information as bump stocks do not increase rate of fire to automatic levels. Are you going to ban belt loops as well?
2572 2018-03-25 01:17:28 What do you think her agenda is?Civilians dont need bump stocks,assault weapons such as the AR-they dont need any guns that can shoot multiple times within seconds. 

What US civilian need is gun owners to have regular federal checks,mental stability checks,clean criminal records
2573 2018-03-25 01:16:39 ...when all this school killing started . been to ATL lately? dont walk at night downtown, insane peeople on streets.we need stop bump stocks, protect schools like we do banks, and have a way to deal with obvious troubled people. how many these have been people others were ...
2574 2018-03-25 01:16:33 @AMarch4OurLives Hello! The use of bump stocks was upheld in 2010 and 2012 by Obama's ATF!  Guess no one cared back them??
2575 2018-03-25 01:16:32 Obama administration approved the sale of bumps stocks. "Not because they liked it, but because the law did not permit them to prohibit it, Actually, Obama didn't legalize bump stocks, the Republican-dominated Congress did.
2576 2018-03-25 01:16:08 LW: Sessions moves to criminalize possession of bump stocks
2577 2018-03-25 01:16:08 Also, he's not the only case there. People truly thought that poker online was taxed like stocks, and since there was no rule whatsoever... the general rule was applied. Thousands got caught in that. Truly sucks.
2578 2018-03-25 01:15:18 bump stocks make no difference, Cruz could have done the deed with a hunting rifle and gotten nearly the same result, hunting rifles don't have bump stocks.  the problem is not with what he used, its how he got to use it and why he wasn't stopped beforehand
2579 2018-03-25 01:15:08 The typical pathological lying b.s.!!! NOBODY is trying to take your stupid, archaic 2A away!!! Gun control and reform is common sense, just as is the banning of all assault weapons and bump stocks, and universal background checks for all gun purchases and transfer of ownership!!
2580 2018-03-25 01:14:51 No, Obama did NOT legalize bump stocks.  CONGRESS chose not to makes them ILLEGAL.  I'm sure you know the difference, and this is yet another lie.
2581 2018-03-25 01:14:20 I wonder if people realize Trump is stopping bum stocks and securing Schools with laws to protect them. They have been sitting ducks with no protection.
2582 2018-03-25 01:14:09 More stock buybacks? The tax cuts are working! For the rich!

But instead of stocks, she ought to be thinking about bump stocks.
2583 2018-03-25 01:13:25 Ban bump stocks, because I can get better results with a piece of string. Ban ALL guns, and I'll find a way. These arguments are beyond the reach of control in any form. Read your history of mankind.
2584 2018-03-25 01:13:22 Thank God President Trump is banning bump stocks THAT YOU LeGALiZED and he is taking action to get violent criminals who use guns off the streets. Too bad you have to use little impressionable kids for your games.
2585 2018-03-25 01:13:02 Would I love it if ALL guns went away? Absolutely! But am I realistic & respect the 2A enough to know that’s not going to happen? Sure. But we can still have commonsense gun laws that protect all people. Safety education requirements. Ban bump stocks, etc. #MarchForOurLives
2586 2018-03-25 01:12:17 Obama didn't legalize bump stocks. Another #LIE from the #LIARINCHIEF
2587 2018-03-25 01:12:13 NRA doesn't care about bump stocks do they? An add-on the munitions manufacturers don't profit from, so the NRA gave their puppet a pass on this one.
2588 2018-03-25 01:11:14 And on the issue of bump stocks: no legislation to this day has strictly limited the ban to bump stocks. The wording is left intentionally vague to potentially incorporate aftermarket grips, stocks, triggers, etc. into the ban.
2589 2018-03-25 01:10:59 Dear @tedlieu do YOU NOT KNOW that @POTUS is banned bump stocks???? 
And, why are YOU ok with a #SanctuaryState which puts LEGAL AMERICANS LIVES AND VOTING RIGHT IN JEOPARDY...
ANSWERS PLEASE...
@AGBecerra SUCKS
2590 2018-03-25 01:10:11 I didn’t hear you or anyone protest when Obama legalized bump stocks and did nothing for gun control for 8 yrs
2591 2018-03-25 01:09:46 LOL. Allowing CDC research and banning bump stocks have just recently been won despite you and your masters’ wishes. These young people are coming for everything you have, and they have the moral high ground. Goodbye, Little Marco.
2592 2018-03-25 01:08:13 You can ban bump stocks. You can write as many rules as you want. That BS does nothing to stem the violence in US. Laws and rules only apply to the lawful citizens. Those intent on harm follow no rules. Just silly stuff with these politicians DTS!
2593 2018-03-25 01:07:59 A few more random stocks where price action is coming down through 50-month moving average: $MDLZ $WHR $WFC $CBS $KMB. This need to reverse by end of the month. Damage likely done technically. Just some names to keep an eye on.
2594 2018-03-25 01:07:40 Liar.

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives ruled in 2010 that bump stocks were not a firearm subject to regulation and allowed their sale as an unregulated firearm part. The ATF does not track production, so no one knows how many are in circulation.[4][7]
2595 2018-03-25 01:07:26 If you want I can send you the PSD. I just used a few nature stocks edited by myself
2596 2018-03-25 01:07:26 Again you lie. FAKE NEWS from the President. Obama did NOT legalize bump stocks. God you are so stupid.
2597 2018-03-25 01:07:21 The executive office has very little to say about this matter... It is a legislative action matter..... It is a judiciary matter..... The executive office at most can reinforce current legislative action or infringements.... Like bump stocks that's it.....
2598 2018-03-25 01:05:46 How real is the possibilty of a full blown trade war, and what it would mean to tech stocks like $amzn $nflx $googl? Would those business be directly impacted or their stock would just suffer due to a widespread market downturn ?
2599 2018-03-25 01:05:39 THE NRA just Files a Federal Law Suit Claiming Florida's New Gun Law BANNING Bump Stocks & Assault Rifles Is UNCONSTITUTIONAL
2600 2018-03-25 01:05:39 Civilians don't need military assault rifles or bump stocks
2601 2018-03-25 01:04:43 Lie!  Bump stocks need to be eliminated through legislation. The ATF said they had no authority to regulate them. We need legislation!
2602 2018-03-25 01:03:42 Politifact: "ATF, a bureau within the executive branch, decided it could not regulate bump stocks during the Obama administration.(...) It’s important to note this was not a statement of Obama’s preferred policy". "mostly" not the same as "true"
2603 2018-03-25 01:03:38 You mean the ATF, not Obama, right? The ATF made the ruling for Bump Stocks due to lack of evidence. BUT Las Vegas happened...and now there's enough to ban these...
2604 2018-03-25 01:03:37 Yea but he said he is gonna ban bump stocks...  Oh and Obama didn't do that and Hillary!
2605 2018-03-25 01:03:21 Yeah, I've been in stocks a lot less than 18 years and if your consensus is that $BYOC needs to rest before moving back up... this makes no sense. Confused and LMAO.  Again due some DD, you've taught us longs here nothing, NOTHING. 
You have some motive obviously, watch this week
2606 2018-03-25 01:03:19 @POTUS By signing the $1.3 trillion spending bill, pushing bans on bump stocks, and by not funding The Wall, Mr Trump joins the ranks of the swamp critters. Just another big talker who betrays the ppl.
@VP, @toddstarnes, @edhenry
2607 2018-03-25 01:03:11 dont you just LOOOOVE practical gifts. like a roll of butter paper, or penknives, or maybe a set of cracked  softwares, or just stocks of drawing pens (bc we lose them every semester break after the final project lol
2608 2018-03-25 01:03:11 Where is it written that bump stocks are constitutional? And you are overreacting. I’m not being passive about anything. I was fuming yesterday when he signed that. But then I thought about it and cooled my head. What is you want anyway?
2609 2018-03-25 01:02:50 smart lady! @ me when you wanna sell your stocks
2610 2018-03-25 01:01:20 I would never buy a bump stock for several reasons, but you do realize that banning bump stocks is just "feel good legislation" that won't really fix anything, don't you?
2611 2018-03-25 01:01:14 Will add to my stocks when I get back home.
2612 2018-03-25 01:01:04 I’ll keep posting this as many times as this tweet appears in my feed: this group is funded by Trump buddy Carl Icahn who magically dumped millions in steel stocks before Trump announced his tariffs. In other words, support @Shelley4Senate and ignore these jerks.
2613 2018-03-25 01:00:53 This is untrue and absurd. In 2010 the ATF reviewed bump stocks and concluded that they couldn’t be regulated under current law. Obama and Eric Holder (AG) were not involved, and they were never “legalized” or “signed into law” because they were never illegal.
2614 2018-03-25 01:00:27 Good ol scapegoat. Bump stocks too lol. Some people have bought those two things hook line a sinker. It’s hilarious.
2615 2018-03-25 01:00:24 There are a lot of articles out there that talk about the market cap not meaning shit in crypto, it is different that stocks on the stock market. Should be interesting to see if this comes into play or not. I’m also aTRX bag holder n would love to see 1$. But doubtful anytimesoon
2616 2018-03-25 01:00:23 you ever see a tweet with 5 likes and you scroll past, then you later see it with 10k RTs and 50k likes and you're like damn I remember when this was a privately owned family tweet but it feels too late to engage bc investment would've meant more when stocks were cheap and scarce
2617 2018-03-25 01:00:19 So, when did Obama "legalize" bump stocks? May I see your sources?
2618 2018-03-25 01:00:19 @realDonaldTrump The tax cut was awesome, but the bill by you signed today was more left wing free  programs. It can’t go both ways. We trust you, but please think more about tariffs before the next minor election. My Asian tech stocks are suffering.
2619 2018-03-25 01:00:17 Lying again. Obama did not legalize bump stocks. You are not campaigning against Obama. Do something more substantial than just bump stocks. You look like an nra tool.
2620 2018-03-25 01:00:16 SQUAREPANTS

On-hand
Buy 3 and get 10% off
Limited stocks
2621 2018-03-25 00:59:24 Everyone remember that what @realDonaldTrump just did by signing Fix NICS into law and instructing Jeff Sessions to ban bump stocks was SUPPORTED by the @NRA they are not our friends. #MarchForOurLives
2622 2018-03-25 00:58:55 Maybe if you owned some gold stocks that were at 2001 or 1997 lows, you'd realize that it is manipulated downward.
2623 2018-03-25 00:58:22 There were literal stickers, buttons, signs, speeches all calling to ban assault weapons, banning bump stocks, and raising the minimum age to 21. Unlike the “pro-life” march where all they did was oppose a 40 year old law
2624 2018-03-25 00:58:17 Hey Marco, how about you give back the money you’ve took from the NRA? Stand up for your constituents and stop trying to bullshit them? The majority of Americans want better background checks, gun show loopholes closed, bump stocks banned.
2625 2018-03-25 00:58:03 About right for a bump stock, but more precision would’ve been nice seeing as they’re barely used and could be made in a wood shop pretty easily. For more info on bump stocks, @ZSquirrel_UC would be able to tell you more than I can.
2626 2018-03-25 00:57:55 The ATF ruled in 2010 (during Obama's presidency) that bump stocks were not a firearm subject to regulation and allowed their sale as an unregulated firearm part. Can't you be a little glad that President Trump is trying to ban them?
2627 2018-03-25 00:57:01 not necessarily, it makes everything expensive and can cause people to basically trade their property (ie, TVs, Cars, Computers, etc) bc money is basically worthless. Any job you work at will invest in stocks, if those stocks are gone, that company that invested can lose millions
2628 2018-03-25 00:56:47 Dear Colion Moir, if your beloved @NRA hadn't turned into a cash driven American terriorist organization, supplying assault guns, bump stocks & limitless magazines to psychos & terriorists, no one would know their names either.
2629 2018-03-25 00:56:30 I cannot believe one person did that regardless of bump stocks. 
Bad example
2630 2018-03-25 00:56:00 Trump is more concerned about amnesty for 2 million illegals & banning bump stocks than his campaign promises to the base. He incited Toomey & other senators to go against the NRA so he could score some points though its the NRA which has steadfastly supported him.
2631 2018-03-25 00:55:55 The Democrats, will still blame the President for a shooter (Stephen Paddock)
 who used a bump stock that killing 59 people and injured 527, at a Vegas concert . "Bump Stocks" were signed into law by President Obama.
2632 2018-03-25 00:55:40 Ion party no more I’m more focused on stocks and saving and shit
2633 2018-03-25 00:55:07 14 mass shootings during Obama’s 8 years. What did he do?  Approved bump stocks and gave lip service to his base.
2634 2018-03-25 00:54:18 How in the hell are they crying wolf?? You didnt have to hold your friend as they lie bleeding out and gasping for air, YOU didnt have to run, scared and looking for safety..THEY DID.  SO you are okay with bump stocks and weapons that can mow down your children..OKAY
2635 2018-03-25 00:53:52 You know what? I misunderstood the point you were making. I was thinking of gun-control proponents in general, and I believe you were talking specifically about those opposing the banning of bump stocks. I apologize and retract my comment.
2636 2018-03-25 00:53:51 Almost feel an obligation, if that’s appropriate as in my 30 years of “playing Stocks”, gambling, call it what you will on the Venture/Vulture Exchange.
2637 2018-03-25 00:52:07 A ban on bum stocks is on the way, a ban on ar15 still leaves guns on the streets although it might reduce casualties. Let’s be real the problem is deeply rooted in society and immorality.  We should focus more on individuals and less on guns
2638 2018-03-25 00:51:25 I love how everything is Obama's fault, 100% of the time. As if the ATF isn't responsible for regulating firearms and accessories. No, Cheeto Benito really thinks Obama PERSONALLY evaluated bump stocks and gave them the thumbs up. Jackass
2639 2018-03-25 00:51:21 While stocks last: Loaded Guys!
Super for Easter!!
2640 2018-03-25 00:51:21 REPEAT OBAMA LEGELIZED " BUMP STOCKS"
2641 2018-03-25 00:50:12 NEW STOCKS SINGAPORE BUNDLES UKAY-UKAY TOMORROW 
Singapore Jumpsuit/Rompers is our new bale more on cotton and chiffon, with tie up..
2642 2018-03-25 00:50:00 In other news today... Stocks Down, Cryptos Up.
2643 2018-03-25 00:49:54 Hope so, I hope they toss t-rump before Pence, just so the big fat ass mf doesn’t have a chance to pick an even shittier vp, and toss sessions out as well. #mj stocks can rise. #anothercampainpromisebroken
2644 2018-03-25 00:49:43 @blakeahssports @realDonaldTrump Wasn't aware Obama banned bump stocks but Trump banned bump stocks- doing nothing never works
2645 2018-03-25 00:49:30 Hey do I have to remind you that's it's your side that refuse to discuss anything that remotely has something to do with gun. Most people want stricter background check and that the minimum age to buy a gun be raise from 18 to 21 Bump stocks and high capacity  clip should be ban
2646 2018-03-25 00:49:17 Seeing is believing . Talk is cheep. We won’t forget what you said. Ban Bump Stocks Now !
2647 2018-03-25 00:49:10 This is a lie. 

The Obama administration didn't legalize bump stocks. 

Obama issued EOs creating stricter controls (all of which YOU have rolled back), but could not legally restrict (non mechanical) bump stocks without new laws. Congress refused.
2648 2018-03-25 00:48:37 As far as I know, the majority of the mass shootings have been at the hands of registered gun owners - with assault rifles and bump stocks.
2649 2018-03-25 00:48:27 I own a single shot rifle and a single pull 9mm.  
My problem is with the AR-15 which is a configuration of the M16/M4 military weapon system, the large magazines and the automatic fire bump stocks.
I wouldn't mind passing a safety test every 3 years and keeping a license.
2650 2018-03-25 00:48:06 Bump stocks are less of a threat to us than the omnibus bill. Why didn’t you fight that?!?
2651 2018-03-25 00:48:05 And completely ignores the fact @realDonaldTrump signed a piece of legislation that included actions on gun violence and his DOJ took action on bump stocks.
2652 2018-03-25 00:47:36 Maybe it’s time to bring back the muskets and flintstocks. Why? Because that’s what the 2nd amendment was referring to, not semi automatic rifles and bump-stocks.
2653 2018-03-25 00:47:30 There was no common ground on votes for women or civil rights. Right is right. Outlaw semi automatic weapons and bumps stocks, heavily increase and improve background checks, and outlaw no check sales at gun shows. No Compromise. Period.
2654 2018-03-25 00:47:28 OBAMA LEGELIZED " Bump Stocks"
Let me repeat that it case it didn't sink in .OBAMA legalized "Bump Stocks" and Trump banned them.
2655 2018-03-25 00:47:13 Banning bump stocks to stop people from converting regular guns into machine guns, while simultaneously refusing to ban machine guns is hypocritical & would increase sale of weapons of war! .@realDonaldTrump #MarchForOurLives #BlueWave2018 #TheResistance
2656 2018-03-25 00:46:15 Read the bill, it’s worded so vaguely that almost any modifications are considered illegal. And I’m talking about modifications that don’t affect the functionality. Things like collapsible stocks, triggers, and scopes.
2657 2018-03-25 00:46:07 Saw one in Boston that said Bump Uglies not Stocks!
2658 2018-03-25 00:46:02 @wsbtv Just played back today's 6pm newscast. You aired a clip of 45 saying the Obama administration legalized bump stocks. That's a blatant lie. You owe it to your viewers to fact check claims and correct them.
2659 2018-03-25 00:45:59 You said the NRA sells semi auto weapons and bump stocks.  So, they don’t?  They just push them like drug dealers who don’t sell drugs, but get drug sellers to sell their drugs?
2660 2018-03-25 00:45:52 Who is grabbing guns from vets?
 No one is even suggesting that! Wanting universal background checks, bump stocks banned, red flag authority and better reporting to NCIC is NOT "gun grabbing." It's common sense for the 21st century.
2661 2018-03-25 00:45:40 You’re kidding right! He’s done more than any President in the past for upcoming gun control. Look who allowed bump stocks to happen!!!
2662 2018-03-25 00:45:36 $COHR, $OLED, AMAT, KLAC, NXPI, $NVDA all oversold tech stocks. All will be bought up.
2663 2018-03-25 00:45:28 Not like you do, because the US is the only country that has asserted that the 2A is a right bestowed by God, not the gov't. Yes, I am concerned that leos have dropped the ball, and that the ATF, under the Obama admin, didn't restrict the sale of bump stocks.
2664 2018-03-25 00:45:04 bump stocks:
Few mind them being banned too much, but your perspective is still too parochial. This gun control "debate" is only an offshoot of a larger power struggle, and taking something without compensation is meant to be a show of power.
2665 2018-03-25 00:44:56 Did you see the little b**** talking about getting an inch with bump stocks and then taking a mile going for all guns? 

That's the plan, see?
2666 2018-03-25 00:44:47 Trumps promise to sign an EO banning Bump Stocks was described as only giving an inch....from what I heard, that may be all he has to give... #PORNADO...Storms' a-coming.  #StandUp
2667 2018-03-25 00:44:30 How many parents do you know who’ve saved a family member with a gun? Which number is greater...the number of innocent lives lost related to gun violence vs lives saved by gun-toting parents? How many parents have used bump stocks or military weapons to protect their families?
2668 2018-03-25 00:44:19 Banning bump stocks...raising the age to 21...these are half measures. When will the U.S. get their arrogance under control and learn from other countries like Australia and Canada...? #halfmeasures
2669 2018-03-25 00:44:03 Trump just banned bump stocks. So, now he's implementing far left gun control policies. WHY should anyone come out and vote GOP? There is NO platform. NO plan. People will stay home. Dems will take the House in Nov. and they WILL impeach Trump. That is THE PLAN.
2670 2018-03-25 00:44:01 #Wattersworld where bump stocks popular before the media made them popular?
2671 2018-03-25 00:43:50 Lie
This is a lie. 

The Obama administration didn't legalize bump stocks. 

Obama issued EOs creating stricter controls (all of which Trump has rolled back), but could not legally restrict (non mechanical) bump stocks without new laws. Congress refused.
2672 2018-03-25 00:43:26 Don’t think they have any clue about how far their stocks have plummeted back home with this - living in a precious, privileged world of their own - there will be a lynch mob waiting at the airport for them
2673 2018-03-25 00:43:18 One could amend the 2nd by excluding weapons of war or equal or similar in firepower, range or frequency. And one could ban magazines with more than 6 in capacity for civilians. And bump stocks. Silencers. Anything that a normal citizen doesn’t need for hunting or self defense.
2674 2018-03-25 00:43:08 To keep kids safe we HAVE to fix/enforce a universal background check system, nationally integrated w law enforcement, fund gun violence research, and ban large capacity magazines & bump stocks. I’d support another 19 yr ban on assault rifles or stricter restrictions to purchase.
2675 2018-03-25 00:42:53 length:
sure, considering eg bullpups, replacing barrel length regulations with overall length restrictions for weapons with fixed stocks seems to make sense

This doesn't look like it will get changed, because inertia. The ATF doesn't have incentives to care about buyers.
2676 2018-03-25 00:42:07 Many Americans want certain things: a ban on bump stocks, a ban on guns like the AR-15 (military-style assault weapons), waiting periods. preventing domestic abusers + most seriously mentally ill from acquiring guns, strict background checks (some states don't have good ones).
2677 2018-03-25 00:41:00 Bumpfire stocks are a joke and useless anytime precision shooting is required.
2678 2018-03-25 00:40:57 I don’t like the idea of bump stocks either. I didn’t even know they existed until the Vegas massacre.
2679 2018-03-25 00:40:02 Only partly accurate.  Obama couldn’t ban bump stocks because, technically, they’re not firearms.  Under current law, they are simply parts. Obama needed Congress need to pass a bill banning bumps.   Responding to pressure from the NRA, it refused to do so.
2680 2018-03-25 00:39:09 @NRA @Emma4Change @davidhogg111 - TO THE NRA: The ability to dictate a change that can positively affect this national crisis (without action from others) - IS YOURS! You can condemn "bump stocks" and endorse common-sense actions. Each of your members will follow you!
2681 2018-03-25 00:38:28 Bump stocks and Assault Rifles are not the problem. People are the problem. #MarchForOurLives
2682 2018-03-25 00:38:20 But it won’t be only bump stocks. It will be ‘any device that allows a semi-auto fire like a full auto.’ Bump firing is a technique so the law will have to be vaguely worded. Will an aftermarket match trigger, that gives a lighter trigger pull (easier firing) qualify?
2683 2018-03-25 00:37:49 Bump stocks ain't gonna cut it this time.  These guys are going down!  Hope the GOP enjoys the short time they have left!
2684 2018-03-25 00:36:58 Any idea of how many protesters were out worldwide today.  Numbnuts decided to ban bump stocks.  That should have been done immediately after Las Vegas.  This is a pathetic move on #45's part to try to placate the resistors
2685 2018-03-25 00:36:34 From what I've researched, bump stocks SUCK. You don't keep something that people on both sides of an issue are against!
2686 2018-03-25 00:35:47 So glad Donald J. Trump is banning bump stocks
2687 2018-03-25 00:35:22 Banning Bump stocks is good but real problem is lack of teaching Morality & 10 Commandments in our schools & failing to deal with students with mental issues or from broken homes. Also the failure of Police depts. & FBI to investigte & act when warned. Parkland could've b prevent
2688 2018-03-25 00:35:11 Been a labor voter all my life, worked hard to set up smsf with my wife and we hoped to never suck on public teat. We only hold dividend stocks in the smsf. This will be a 25% pay cut for us. Is that fair? We will end up needing a pension. How is that better for everyone else?
2689 2018-03-25 00:34:52 I f you are holding good stocks don't panic the market always comes back stronger Even after the crash of 29 those who held the line came out way ahead.
2690 2018-03-25 00:34:43 @JasmineMaguirex @JordaaanF you two the other night I swear
2691 2018-03-25 00:34:29 Congrats once again @RamblersMBB. They'll believe you when you win the whole thing.  
Back to resource stocks.
2692 2018-03-25 00:33:41 2nd A doesn’t give u the right to assault rifles, high capacity magazines or bump stocks- a musket maybe!
2693 2018-03-25 00:33:35 to be fair it isn't a presidential issue. Congress must come together and act for the benefit of the nation. but at least Trump started with the ban of the bump stocks.
2694 2018-03-25 00:32:56 Yes Chris, when you are the president and you do ABSOLUTELY  nothing about gun control, but legalized bump stocks. While constantly crying about guns. It is his faultLet is not forget the 500,000 felons that were able to buy guns. Thanks to O! Doesn’t that make you go hmm
2695 2018-03-25 00:32:38 Bump stocks should be legal

Fully-autos should be legal

No ID should be required

No background checks

18+ at least should be able to own guns

"""mentally ill""" too

I should be able to buy guns as easily as my groceries

2697 2018-03-25 00:32:04 ...as far as "Gun Ownership Regulations" I have seen a myriad set of overlapping policies suggested.  Prohibition of bump stocks, restriction of feeding device capacities, or even the outright ban of modern rifles.

I do not know where you, personally, fall on this topic...
2698 2018-03-25 00:32:01 Nobody lost anything. The value of stocks dropped. If nobody sold (which they didn't, they bought the dip. Stocks were on sale, guys!) then nobody lost anything. News flash: stock markets rise and fall. Who'd have thought?
2699 2018-03-25 00:31:31 You losing your stocks ?
2700 2018-03-25 00:31:15 No ONE WANTS TO REPEAL THE 2ND AMENDMENT

EVEN 1 LIFE? CHILD OR ADULT

2701 2018-03-25 00:31:00 Ma’am, I’ll never throw in the towel. You know that. If you read my tweets, ban bump stocks, extensive background checks, no gun “show” purchasing. 21 to purchase any weapons. 10 day waiting period. License all weapon purchase.

2704 2018-03-25 00:29:56 Explain exactly what you common sense gun laws entail? Let me guess ban military weapons (already are), close gun show loophole (doesn’t exist), background checks (already in place), ban bump stocks (done). This is a political stunt! @JesseBWatters #MarchForOurLives
2705 2018-03-25 00:29:06 It’s so upsetting when you feel like no matter what you do, you can’t satisfy or make someone happy
2706 2018-03-25 00:28:52 CNN: What stocks are not owned by Saudi Arabia & in CNN parent companies. Is owned by anti-American Marxist. Why would Americans take a "news" organization seriously that gave us 9/11 and 150 million murders? Answer: We don't.
2707 2018-03-25 00:28:08 If you're going to shame them put in public stocks.
2708 2018-03-25 00:25:54 We are indeed. However, I do think bump stocks increased the body count that night. About the only time they do that is when firing into a crowd large enough to not be able to disperse quickly enough. They burn out the rifle but he had plenty of them.
2709 2018-03-25 00:25:36 Oh no! Not a ban on bump stocks!!
2710 2018-03-25 00:25:18 Isn’t it bump stocks?
2711 2018-03-25 00:25:18 “Masquerading as history?” Dear God you did not just write that yourself surely one of your many kids (AKA-goats) hijacked your twitter account. Please delve into history; Joe Kennedy IS the bootlegger to make money then buy stocks-legitimate $
2712 2018-03-25 00:24:55 I'm at peace, I'm the man
Buying stocks on the day of the crash
On the loose, I'm a truck
All the rolling hills, I'll flatten 'em out, yeah
It's herd behavior, uh huh
It's evolution, baby

 #PearlJamNoMultishow
2713 2018-03-25 00:24:43 Also why is @KillerMike conflating owning a pistol for protection or rifle for hunting to owning semis/autos? 

Does he really think bump stocks, high capacity mags or mentally ill, abusers, suspected terrorists' owning them is okay?!! What is his view on Uni background checks?

2717 2018-03-25 00:23:11 Then let me explain: Red Flag laws (such as GVROs and EVPOs), safe storage laws, a ban on bump stocks, a ban on high-capacity magazines, funding for gun violence research, and a ban on guns for domestic abusers, stalkers, and the mentally ill.
2718 2018-03-25 00:23:09 How does "Euro guys" translate to "Euroleague". I do think the NCAA stocks guys with more potential, but the one guy I'm intrigued with is Doncic, no one else. The Euroleague is a better league than any other league besides the NBA. College ball has players with far more potentia
2719 2018-03-25 00:22:52 Yes, but those charts are highly misleading because the 2008 crash happened literally months before Obama took office. The resulting rise was largely because the Fed, post-crash, kept interest rates artificially low to boost stocks. Actual economic growth was anemic at best.
2720 2018-03-25 00:22:40 I should make a list of all the stocks I have never traded...
    for entertainment purposes.
$CMG $WMT $AMZN $DIS  and the rest of em haha
$BABA $BIDU and all of them too...
2721 2018-03-25 00:21:30 Semi-automatic rifles shoot as fast as you can pull the trigger, pistols as well. Bump stocks are a way to modify certain rifles to make them "automatic". Similarly many (if not most) non revolver pistols can be mechanically altered to become automatic.
2722 2018-03-25 00:21:29 In 2010/2012 the ATF determined that bump stocks are not guns, only gun parts therefore can’t be banned. The Obama administration could not ban them because the law says they are legal. You can’t ban them either. Congress must change the law. Good luck w/that!
2723 2018-03-25 00:20:35 People can make bump stocks, so ban away.
2724 2018-03-25 00:20:18 Ima start buying Vans and Tommy stocks
2725 2018-03-25 00:19:38 Yeah I was going to say, usually the M-4s I have seen have had stocks on the back end so I was confused but after zooming in it I see it boss! Definitely agree with your though! Those guns are nasty , definitely shouldn’t be in civilian hands
2726 2018-03-25 00:19:23 He’s already done that. Has always supported ban on assault weapons, supports limiting ammo, no bump stocks, voted to expanded background checks, will support revising liability law, supports closing gun show and straw loopholes, and funding for CDC research.
2727 2018-03-25 00:19:19 Men & woman who make a living by carrying guns 24/7 scare me. Perhaps armed body guards should be banned along with bump stocks & AR15s.
2728 2018-03-25 00:19:17 Well, you’re a lawyer for pity’s sake! You should know they aren’t trying to ban guns or end the 2nd A. It is legal to ban AR15s, bump stocks, require registration, safe storage, license fees, background checks and a waiting period. It’s a well regulated militia.
2729 2018-03-25 00:18:34 I just don't know why the NRA and gun owners don't get that WE DON'T WANT TO STOP PEOPLE FROM OWNING A GUN. JUST STRICTER GUN LAWS LIKE BANNING BUMP STOCKS, ASSUALT RIFLES AND DO MORE THOROUGH BACKGROUND CHECK!!  No one is is saying to strip away the 2nd ammend! R u that stupid!
2730 2018-03-25 00:18:21 It was the ATF that ruled on bump stocks. Obama issued a slew of executive orders promoting stricter gun control, which the Trump administration has been rolling back, including a measure that previously prevented people with mental illness from buying guns.  Ok Donald?
2731 2018-03-25 00:17:48 As I gun owner I have to disagree with your stand on military-style assault weapons, bumper stocks and extended magazines. You're supporting the gun industry sales, not our personal rights. You're hurting our country....knock it off!
2732 2018-03-25 00:17:36 text is lit but needs more on the background itself try adding stocks/overlays
2733 2018-03-25 00:17:24 Forget stocks. Forget housing. Forget bitcoin. Human society is in a bubble. We're due for a major correction

#March4OurLives
2734 2018-03-25 00:17:12 I think it's reasonable to ban bump stocks and make the background checks more extensive for buying a gun. But I still find it ironic that the same people who swear the president is a fascist are now begging him to confiscate weapons.
2735 2018-03-25 00:17:07 We've put 1000s of rounds down range using bump-stocks & have yet to damage a weapon. They're awkward to operate as they violate nearly every proper firing/aiming technique in order to function. There aren't any legal civilian applications these things would be useful for.
2736 2018-03-25 00:16:27 I thought the only issues with fun were bump stocks, automatic firing and military use. Boy am I confused? 
2737 2018-03-25 00:16:03 .223?! Huh? 7.62, .308, 30-06, .224...fool you have no idea what you are talking about. It sucks being shot with ANY caliber.  Pistol grips, short stocks...or adjustable stocks fool!(God forbid people have different arm lengths). And SEMI-AUTOMATIC describes pretty much all guns.
2738 2018-03-25 00:15:03 Maybe someone should 'dare' @realDonaldTrump to use Twitter with simple yes/no vote to implementing the following.

Ban assault weapons
Ban bump stocks
Mandatory background checks for all weapons sold thru ANY medium.

Majority wins.....
2739 2018-03-25 00:15:03 Look around, smell the coffee.

AR-15s, high capacity mag's, bump-stocks, children & citizens murdered at the hand of unhinged right wings ding bats.

2nd amendment? Are you the militia or have trumpy-finger syndrome?

Books not guns. Teachers not snipers. Country > NRA.
2740 2018-03-25 00:14:55 #WakeUpUSA Bad enough to BS everyone on this,BUT

I THINK DOJ asked for Congress to do a ban on bump-stocks,right?
I mean the DOJ can't just"outlaw"shit.

SO WHERE IS THE STATEMENT FM TRUMP being 100% IN SUPPORT OF THAT BAN?

Won't see that unless the NRA gives him permission
2741 2018-03-25 00:14:45 I support gun control & love the kids marching however when you throw in all the anti Trump rhetoric you lose me. Why? Because he is the only President to outlaw bump stocks & change age limit.I have a dream everyone working together as a “Country” and stop bashing everyone!

2744 2018-03-25 00:14:00 We notice some people hyping stocks with unbelievable target. Be extra careful when you buy newbies. It will reach its target but you might be the one holding the stock when it starts going down. They pump it then dump it.
2745 2018-03-25 00:13:03 me: 0 stocks
my opponent: 3 stocks, 0%
2746 2018-03-25 00:12:58 It’s not nonsense lad. Most of Americans agree that people should be allowed guns for self defense. It’s the automatic weapons that are causing the problems. Donald helped by banning the bump stocks. That’s a start. Barack done nothing
2747 2018-03-25 00:12:46 I see increased sales of Pepto Bismol and Imodium happening soon. Buy the stocks of the companies that make these products, now!
2748 2018-03-25 00:12:44 You do realize you are lying about the Obama Admin "legaized bump stocks", yes?

2750 2018-03-25 00:12:03 using the old hair dye refresher tube in a desperate attempt to fix my roots because no-one fUCKING stocks my favourite hair dye kit rn
2751 2018-03-25 00:11:48 I support gun control & love the kids marching for it however when you throw in all the anti Trump rhetoric you lose me. Why? Because he is the only President to outlaw bump stocks & change age limit. Barack & Bill was 8 years in office & did nothing!
2752 2018-03-25 00:11:11 Dear idiot senator: it's not a gun BAN. It's gun REGULATION . " reasonable regulations that 80% of Americans support. Try and work with accurate facts. What the proposed BAN is: bump stocks, assault style weapons and large clip magazine sales to civilians.
2753 2018-03-25 00:11:10 Did you like your new taxes you got back this year? Or money in stocks? Or that doesn’t matter?
2754 2018-03-25 00:10:36 I think an advantage of growth stocks are that they can outrun market declines if starting valuation is reasonable and earnings continue growing at a rapid clip. Even in the unlikely event a healthy and growing FB falls to 10x earnings, how long will that last?
2755 2018-03-25 00:10:25 And FYI I’m an adult, a hunter and a gun owner that lives in Alabama.. so before you start spouting bullshit you should know that.. we can still have 2A without having easy access to AR-15s, bump stocks and high capacity magazines..
2756 2018-03-25 00:10:17 Do you own stocks in hq trivia?
2757 2018-03-25 00:09:19 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS 
The premiss of your document ATF 2017R-22 is untrue. 
Bump stocks do not modify a firearm.
A semiautomatic firearm is not capable of firing more than once per trigger pull.
A bump stock is not a firearm and therefore not a (machine)gun.
2758 2018-03-25 00:08:53 It's fine, do me a favor. Look up how bump stocks work and how you use them. Very difficult. I'd as a Marine have issues with one.
2759 2018-03-25 00:08:47 I support gun control & love the kids marching for it however when you throw in all the anti Trump rhetoric you lose me. Why? Because he is the only President to outlaw bump stocks & change age limit. @BarackObama was 8 years in office & during Sandy Hook & did nothing!
2760 2018-03-25 00:08:29 Not entirely true. It was ruled by the ATF that bump stocks were not considered “firearms” and therefore could not be lawfully regulated.
2761 2018-03-25 00:08:09 I AM DUMB I THOUGHT I TYPED BUMP STOCKS BUT APPARENTLY NOT
2762 2018-03-25 00:08:06 Diddy & Stocks Drop Out of Panthers Bidding
2763 2018-03-25 00:07:06 Obama did not regulate bump stocks. Liar
2764 2018-03-25 00:06:55 Banning bump stocks is asinine. You can bump fire with nothing
2765 2018-03-25 00:06:53 Bump stocks do NOT turn anything into a machine gun ...good grief. Some of us are not stupid.
2766 2018-03-25 00:06:24 Gun reform is not unconstitutional nimrod. More stringent background checks, removing bump stocks, moving purchasing age to 21, and ammo restrictions is NOT unconstitutional. Nobody is saying remove guns from law abiding citizens. Educate yourself before you embarrass yourself
2767 2018-03-25 00:06:12 Stocks don't do anything other than help aim.. are you talking about bump stocks?
2768 2018-03-25 00:06:01 To understand the proposed rule change on bump stocks, you need some firearms knowledge & some policymaking knowledge. I have enough of the former & a lot of the latter. Most opponents of it have a lot of the former & not enough of the latter. They have fallen into a trap.
2769 2018-03-25 00:05:32 We invest in Stocks/Crypto not because they are our favourite football team but because we see a good investment! Regardless of the crypto/non-crypto argument its all about what we see as a good investment and people investing in @ripple see that as it has a great future!
2770 2018-03-25 00:05:18 Agreed. We must become single issue voters laser focused on whether candidates will support meaningful gun control legislation.  No table crumbs like bump stocks or funding to study the issue. Remember we couldn't even unify to elect Hillary so it is a challenge.
2771 2018-03-25 00:05:17 Gun stocks are *still* not banned, so comparing semi rifles is ineffective.
2772 2018-03-25 00:05:17 Do you even know there were no such thing as AR-15 and bump stocks when the 2nd Amendment was written? You are not the only American here.
2773 2018-03-25 00:05:12 It’s not video games
It’s not age restrictions 
It’s not mental health
It’s not background checks
It’s not bump stocks

IT’S AUTOMATIC WEAPONS IN THE HANDS OF CITIZENS 

BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS NOW 
#BanAssaultWeaponsNow
2774 2018-03-25 00:04:20 Yeah don't get it. However restricting bump stocks and shit is important
2775 2018-03-25 00:03:43 Another lie Adolph, Obama had nothing to do with bump stocks. Why debate the issue, Sign one your giant executive orders.
2776 2018-03-25 00:02:14 @RealDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr have YET to ban bump stocks. What are they waiting for?  #MarchForOurLives
2777 2018-03-25 00:02:10 Well it literally is wrong. They already got Florida to make some changes like banning bump stocks.

We'll see what more happens.
2778 2018-03-25 00:01:19 Do you disagree with him banning bump stocks or making background checks stricter?
2779 2018-03-25 00:00:45 You really need to read something. Bump stocks are common knowledge, as well as the rounds per minute I have referenced here.
2780 2018-03-25 00:00:25 And you still blame the inanimate object and not the person. Bump stocks , I agree , its a device that significantly modifies fire rate.
The weapon did not do the damage though . People failed and a person done it , not the damn weapon.
2781 2018-03-25 00:00:22 Banning "assault weapons" focused on pistol grips and adjustable stocks isn't reasonable in my book.  We need more education.  What's "common sense" for some people is a result of ignorance.
2782 2018-03-25 00:00:12 really nigga i caught an L and you follow me to rub it in my face that bots fucking ate up stocks in my region? REALLY?
2783 2018-03-25 00:00:08 A ban on assault rifles, large magazines, and bump stocks do not infringe on second amendment rights.  You know that.  Stop trying to ride both sides.  If you will stand for nothing,you will fall for anything.
2784 2018-03-25 00:00:01 The Obama Administration also turned down banning bump stocks twice.
2785 2018-03-23 23:59:57 Who cares about bump stocks at this point. Like complaining about the music on the titanic.
2786 2018-03-23 23:59:42 That’s why I like these stocks. Sector is out of favor right now. Great dividend yields.  PE’s are reasonable for these steady cash flow stocks.  Also, they may finally get some love if the turbulence in the market continues. Look forward to your opinions on BUD and PEP.
2787 2018-03-23 23:59:32 Actually, the ATF decided that bump stocks were legal.
2788 2018-03-23 23:59:30 Banning bump stocks was the right thing to do...

Because Obama
2789 2018-03-23 23:59:17 Why cause obama didn't find bump stocks to be Illegal and now trump is trying to limit them..
2790 2018-03-23 23:59:17 Banning bump stocks is about as useful as banning turbo chargers. Ass.
2791 2018-03-23 23:59:16 YOU KNOW WHY TRUMP BANNED THE BUMP STOCKS IT WAS BECAUSE & ONLY BECAUSE OBAMA DID ALLOW THEM ..SO HE JUST UN-DID IT BECAUSE OBAMA ALLOWED IT.  BUT WE ARE TALKING NOW 2018 AR-15'S NEED TO BE BANNED EXCEPT TO POLICE & MILITARY! DO IT PRES.  TRUMP BIG THE BETTER PRESIDENT!
2792 2018-03-23 23:59:10 Bump stocks can’t be regulated.  It’s important this was not a statement of Obama’s preferred policy, which called for more regulation of guns, but was what the agency determined it had to do under the language of current law. Trump is a LIAR!!  & allows mentally ill to buy guns.
2793 2018-03-23 23:59:01 Why not a time machine go back win the lottery and play stocks to get 70 million love?
2794 2018-03-23 23:58:58 How much are betting someone told Sessions black people can buy bump stocks too.
2795 2018-03-23 23:58:22 Not quite the truth is it Donnie?  No your NRA bought your GOP buddies who then tied Obama’s hands. Big deal anyway. The problem isn’t bump stocks. It’s kids with access to guns and mental illness. You are going nothing to address the real issue. You are paid for by the NRA too.
2796 2018-03-23 23:58:07 Melt up, you sonofabitch.  If I wanted low vol, I'd trade stocks like a bellend $btc
2797 2018-03-23 23:57:45 Trump’s tweet about bump stocks creating “illegal machine guns” leads me to believe that he thinks machine guns are illegal. 

Wew.
2798 2018-03-23 23:57:40 Bump stocks have been around for a while, it’s not misinforming anyone troll
2799 2018-03-23 23:57:11 Smile. You got every conservative funding issue you wanted: 1) $ for planned parenthood; 2)out-lawing bump stocks; 3) $ for border fence; 4) funding for sanctuary cities; lol. Guess what? All Trump had to do was veto it. He didn't. No spin zone: he slashed regulations. y not veto
2800 2018-03-23 23:57:01 Existing gun control law doesn't give Trump the power to ban bump-stocks.

The NRA knows this which is why they're not saying a word about Trump's action. They'll quietly sue when the rule's finalized... and Trump will shrug.
2801 2018-03-23 23:56:51 Obama legalized bump stocks? Boy, you really DON’T  have a clue as to how government works, do you?
2802 2018-03-23 23:56:45 Did someone hack your account or wtf?? You're complaining about lack of DACA fix and bump stocks being legalized??? I can't imagine what your supporters must be thinking. They have supported you through so much embarrassing antics hoping beyond hope that you had their backs, wow!
2803 2018-03-23 23:55:59 It appears the glue Maggie is talking about is a reference to the status quo political establishment and its methods. A huge bill signed today, bump stocks banned, etc. I say give us less glue.
2804 2018-03-23 23:55:56 Except you were. Your first sentence was addressing the ban on bump stocks eroding the 2nd amendment.

2825 2018-03-23 23:55:54 you know Twitler sells the stock of whatever business/industry he attacks just days before he does it. Then he rakes in all that $$ and rebuys when the stocks bottom out. He's making himself a pile of dough with every tweet.
2826 2018-03-23 23:55:39 Bump Stocks aren’t the problem @JohnCornyn, mentally ill people are the problem.
2827 2018-03-23 23:55:29 @LouDobbs Obama blamed everyone else for his mistakes & now Trump is doing the same. He was given a mandate on many issues but instead didn't do anything or backtracked on promises-DACA, H1 & other work visas, Johnson amendment, China currency manipulation, banning bump stocks
2828 2018-03-23 23:55:18 Obama did not legalize bump stocks.
2829 2018-03-23 23:55:15 I didn't take that gentlemans comments to be tips either, I took it as a person with knowlege of guns being confused as to why everyone is so excited over banning bump stocks which are just a pretty accessory not necessary to sustain rapid fire.
2830 2018-03-23 23:54:51 Newfoundland cod stocks declining. Experts blame the fish for being so darn delicious!
2831 2018-03-23 23:54:23 Bumps stocks were allowed due to a loop hole that congress created when they wrote the legislation banning  automatic weapons.

Congress are the only folks that can change the law, as you’ll soon find out from the lawsuits..
2832 2018-03-23 23:54:09 Banning bump stocks is just feel good rulemaking which won't save any lives.  Even OBAMA knew he wasn't allowed to legislate them away by executive action.  Tell me why it was a good idea to elect YOU  to stop executive overreach again?????
2833 2018-03-23 23:53:38 Stock Market ROCKETS UP 305 after Trump was elected, @CNN IGNORES.

Stock Market CORRECTS 10% and CNN is STOCKS CRASH STOCKS CRASH 24/7
2834 2018-03-23 23:53:19 The hell they didn’t ... bump stocks were made so the Handicapped could fire the weapon ... that’s how they were marketed and made legal under Obama ...
2835 2018-03-23 23:53:17 What are you going to do about all the bump stocks and automatic weapons that are already out there?
2836 2018-03-23 23:53:15 Actually "president" Fuckface, the ATF in 2010 said there was nothing they could do to stop the sale of bump stocks. Obama wanted to change that law, but congress wouldn't budge. Have you ever gone more than 5 minutes w/o lying?
2837 2018-03-23 23:53:01 If guns were actually regulated, strongly, to include cohesive background checks on all gun sale zero tolerance for AR-15s, bump stocks and other overkill Arsenal’s—then gun manufacturers would not be faced with going out of business. Meanwhile 3% people own half all guns.
2838 2018-03-23 23:52:53 Michael... where in the second amendment does it state that bump stocks are a constitutional right. They literally turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns. I don’t understand not supporting this.
2839 2018-03-23 23:52:50 Goddammit @HardballChris @MSNBC, STOP editing Trump's tweets. Instead of calling out his lies, you are just leaving them out. Fact check those statements about Obama and bump stocks. YOU are normalizing him!
2840 2018-03-23 23:52:46 "i shorted my first stocks today"
FTFY :D
2841 2018-03-23 23:52:33 started to slowly buy my $DB stocks back today
2842 2018-03-23 23:52:27 We banned bump stocks today. Unsurprisingly, bump stock stocks were bumped down significantly.
2843 2018-03-23 23:52:10 #RealNews The Obama ATF didn't legalize because they liked bump stocks, but because law didn't permit them to prohibit. You're partly wrong about machine guns being illegal. Congress banned sale of new MGs for civilians in 1986 but older are still allowed with special permit.
2844 2018-03-23 23:51:59 Just another lie Trump.   Dont treat us with contempt 

The Obama administration could not progress gun reform through the GOP dominated House and Senate.  Legal advice stated that an executive order would be illegal.

Bump stocks lay at yhe feet of the GOP
2845 2018-03-23 23:51:35 Gun crazies try to shout people down. They  wail about their Second Amendment rights. The word “speech” appears in Constitution. The words “assault-style rifle”, “bump stocks” and “high capacity magazines” do not.
2846 2018-03-23 23:51:30 Bump stocks didn’t kill people.  Another big brother over reach
2847 2018-03-23 23:51:26 Founders legalized bump stocks.
2848 2018-03-23 23:51:19 Free country until it's not. Have you seen the Cloud Act in the bill? Trump wants to take away due process too. Fix NICS will dot that. Also the bump stock bill will cover more than bump stocks if the ATF wants too.  It won't be free country much longer.
2849 2018-03-23 23:51:13 well, then i don't get how you can be ok with someone giving tips on how to simulate the effect of a bump stock under an article that deals with banning bump stocks. this might be the thing that a gun owner knows but i didn't and the next frustrated kid didn't either....
2850 2018-03-23 23:51:08 I'm sure there's some stocks bucking the general trend. He'll find em.
2851 2018-03-23 23:51:02 @HyleysTeaOnline where do you see junior mining stocks on ASX going in 2018?
2852 2018-03-23 23:51:00 we need bump stocks in case u get assassinated by the secret society. Who's gonna stick up for us if something happens to you?
2853 2018-03-23 23:50:58 Bump stocks don't push the needle one way or another. They are irrelevant. Ban em, don't, whatever. #2A
2854 2018-03-23 23:50:50 At this point, I’m losing faith in Trump.  Ted would be better president and my stocks wouldn’t be tanking.
2855 2018-03-23 23:50:40 Stupidity.  Don’t care about bump stocks or DACA.  Care about the ridiculous spending bill Trump signed.  Disappointed.  Fool me once.
2856 2018-03-23 23:50:39 @KennethLFisher In Page 47 in your book, "super stocks" you state that individuals we should avoid stocks with PSRs greater than 1,5, do you still stick by that rule?
2857 2018-03-23 23:50:39 Everything is happening exactly like you said! Oil moving up gold moving up stocks and bonds moving down. Emerging markets red a bit today tho... other than that everything looking good for my accounts.
2858 2018-03-23 23:50:38 buying stocks is fine, but rn is pretty sketch
2859 2018-03-23 23:50:15 Not that I'm an advocate of bump stocks, but have we ever once seen a case of them being used incorrectly? What's the point?
2860 2018-03-23 23:50:04 Serious fuck daca ..... No hate here people I love everyone .... Your stupid wall money can be used to support America internal economy .... Stocks njust went down are you planing to bankrupct America to anytime soon ?! Because spending without having return is a disaster
2861 2018-03-23 23:50:02 @JeanneBartram where do you see junior mining stocks on TSX Venture going in 2018?
2862 2018-03-23 23:49:50 Bump stocks weren't even mentioned until the Vegas shootings but Trump is always lying when his mouth is moving. Stop blaming everyone else. Traitor. Why don't you resign?
2863 2018-03-23 23:49:30 Buying Stocks? I like the idea, at least you have some control of your destiny. 401k on the other hand.....
2864 2018-03-23 23:49:22 I suspect it was Miller who planted the whole “age limit/National background check/limited magazines/ban on assault rifles & bump stocks” gun control idea. When that didn’t work, buzz words like Nuclear Weapons, North Korea, & Iran reappeared on the networks. Gotta thin the herd?
2865 2018-03-23 23:49:11 His business pals got advance word of his next EO ..dumped their relevant stocks at a profit ..waited for the market to tank. ..then bought in again at a much lower price. #Trump is not harming the stock market, he’s manipulating it.
2866 2018-03-23 23:49:09 Nahhh. I've used bump stocks. There is no reason to have them legal. There is no practicality to using them. Let's allow a legal loophole of the law so we can provide entertainment? NAHHHH! Just because there is no spring involved does not mean they should be allowed.
2867 2018-03-23 23:48:57 You liberals get bump stocks banned. Lol. You should be happy. 
2868 2018-03-23 23:48:46 Lordy. If you knew these were so dangerous why didn’t you ban bump stocks BEFORE the Las Vegas shooting occurred? Right, it is because you have some weird obsession with President Obama.
2869 2018-03-23 23:48:36 Justice Department is proposing a rule to band bump stocks per Sessions today    #itsastart #Vegasstrong
2870 2018-03-23 23:48:28 @HardballChris Telling U  something U didn’t know. 4 yrs they said Obama coming 4 ur Guns. Trump told us today, obama legalized bump stocks
2871 2018-03-23 23:48:26 WRONG again or  lying again. Which one is it? Obama Admin didn't legalize bump stocks. Someone needs to educate themselves. Your staff from Fox news is likely little help to you in facts. They run from facts.
2872 2018-03-23 23:48:18 Oh bullshit. Machine guns are banned, bump stocks allow semi automatic guns to fire at the rate of machine guns. That’s the embodiment of common sense gun laws.
2873 2018-03-23 23:48:05 I have quite a bit of experiance with guns of all types and have personally bump fired a AR without need for a bump stock.  My point is legislation to ban bump stocks is a giveaway for the NRA and Trump to save face.
2874 2018-03-23 23:47:52 With all these car companies going electric is it better to have stocks in cars, utilities or raw materials for batteries in your opinion? Thank you Enjoy your opinions on CNBC
2875 2018-03-23 23:47:42 @jimcramer How exactly do you make China change their ways without disrupting stocks temporarily? There is no way. There has to be winners and losers within the US and the losers will whine loudly. Too bad. A NET win for the US is all that matters.  China’s cheating must stop
2876 2018-03-23 23:47:33 I just read the skinny about bump stocks...why what did we get wrong? Did you understand my concern in my tweet? I said this is how it starts, I'm factoring in other comments he's made and the fact that this may lead to harsher legislation if they get a majority.
2877 2018-03-23 23:47:31 Bump Stocks are not Weapons an does not fall under the Justice Dept. Control or that of the ATF under the National Firearms Act. It is considered a "PART" that will fall under a congressional Legislation Ban! Ryan said: He will look at that! That's all he said about Bump Stocks.
2878 2018-03-23 23:46:08 Is that why companies drove their stocks down to buyback their stocks cheap!

2880 2018-03-23 23:45:54 Kind of makes you think "which is it #trump"?  Ban Bump stocks or something that makes it an automatic weapon?
2881 2018-03-23 23:45:34 Alan! I started as a novice investor 2.5 yrs ago. You hinted a few stocks and I did well. Also , you call out the BS which I have been a victim of.  Thanks for your DD and your App.
2882 2018-03-23 23:45:31 It can, please stop NBC. This debate truly doesn't matter, bump stocks are toys. I just wanna push for semi-automatic regulation, please stop this.
2883 2018-03-23 23:45:26 Ridiculous! Bump stocks are not a problem just because of a stray incident. Evil people are a problem. The southern border is a problem. Texting and driving is a problem....it is responsible for more than 4,000 deaths of teens per year. Will he ban cell phones?
2884 2018-03-23 23:45:18 Amazing, don't know anything about the Vegas shooting but,  ban bump stocks. We know Florida shooting was nothing other than government failure but we need more gun control.  Then there's #OmnibusBill, not a good day for conservatives. 
2885 2018-03-23 23:45:14 I hear if your store stocks snacks then @DiversityAndCmx will visit you and spread good times and cheer to your location.
2886 2018-03-23 23:45:11 What exactly did the Obama administration do to legalize bump stocks?
2887 2018-03-23 23:45:04 Ban the bump stocks. We don’t need these nuts running around with automatic weapons. It’s crazy
2888 2018-03-23 23:45:01 Where do I have to go to see charts like this? I’m very new to stocks. TIA
2889 2018-03-23 23:44:49 That’s a misleading lie. The Obama Administration stated that current (at the time) law did not allow them to ban bump stocks. Big difference.
2890 2018-03-23 23:44:49 I suggest you read the comments under his tweet about banning bump stocks ....his every dutiful supporters arent happy
2891 2018-03-23 23:44:47 Time to buy stocks
2892 2018-03-23 23:44:31 Bump stocks don't turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.
2893 2018-03-23 23:44:22 James laughed when Trump ran for president and won.  James laughed about the wall & and it did get funding. Trump all but eliminated ISIS, stood up to Putin in Syria, has Rocketman& China crawling to the bargaining table, eliminated bump stocks & got tax cuts. Screw you James!

2895 2018-03-23 23:44:17 You really are a nasty piece of work aren't you! @BarackObama legalised bump stocks? Don't think so, it was just an additional piece of gun equipment marketed by the NRA and gun market, Obama administration might be guilty of not seeing its impact but not as you try to imply!
2896 2018-03-23 23:44:14 volve que tenes que hacer nosequecosa con tus stocks
2897 2018-03-23 23:44:11 Honestly, bump stocks aren't even on the peripheral of my worries right now. I feel pretty assured the odds of bump stocks harming my family pale to the massive debt they will have to deal with in their bleak American future.
2898 2018-03-23 23:43:57 Is that why companies drove their stocks down to buyback their stocks cheap!
2899 2018-03-23 23:43:43 The sale of bumb stocks is the problem....along with evil people!
2900 2018-03-23 23:43:40 @realDonaldTrump #sad  You're such a loser.  It's amazing someone as dumb as you ever became President of such a fine country.  It's okay though, morons eventually become the laughing stocks of history.  America will be fine.
2901 2018-03-23 23:43:39 Stocks getting shitted on. 
2902 2018-03-23 23:43:25 Si, ils les ressortent tous les ans pour Pâques, et mon frère fait des stocks (qui durent ce que durent les roses...)
2903 2018-03-23 23:43:11 Doesn’t matter to me they can have em nobody really even uses bump stocks
2904 2018-03-23 23:43:09 Wrong! Bump stocks were never legal. The stocks just happened. Obama never passed a law to legalize! Glad to see you are still blaming Obama for everything!
2905 2018-03-23 23:42:40 Forget the ignorant stupidity of "rogue government" coming from the people who like Trump because he's "not a politician". That's just too much irony to deal with tight now. Let's talk about your bump stocks saving u from tanks and Apache helicopters, drones, fighter jets etc.
2906 2018-03-23 23:42:31 I wouldn’t hold my breath waiting for him to comment on the drop in stocks...
2907 2018-03-23 23:42:24 there's a huge difference between actively searching for something or being confronted with dangerous information under an article about banning dangerous "weapons" ...and please...let's now have a lengthy discussion about how bumb stocks are not weapons.
2908 2018-03-23 23:42:23 That is wonderful. Folks, remember, gun control does not mean gone loss. Just a few tweaks. No bump stocks. Better background checks. Raise the age to 21. one or two of these things will help. Stop all gun deaths? Of course not. But if it saves 17 children it has to be worth it
2909 2018-03-23 23:42:07 Ur on a slippery slope. Its hard 2agree w/ this one. Especially 4the fact that u and I, and anyone who knows anything about tactical weapons & has studied the audio/video, know damn well that bump stocks were not used @ the October 1 shooting in Vegas. #2A #ShallNotBeInfringed
2910 2018-03-23 23:41:45 Dear .@LouDobbs, FYI: The #2A is NOT about just defending our home or hunting, It's about preventing Tyranny from our Government. BTW: Banning Bump Stocks is just a #FEELGOOD policy, They are easily made at home.
2911 2018-03-23 23:41:45 Evil people with bump stocks are a problem.
2912 2018-03-23 23:41:39 If he doesn’t quit gambling with tariff war, it maybe true. Last time Bush started with steel tariff, market sunk 30% that year. I am wondering if I should even sell my invest stocks like $NVDA while still up nice before gets ugly. Oh boy.
2913 2018-03-23 23:41:34 Issuing a ruling on banning bump stocks, a good thing, is not the same as a comprehensive gun reform bill. Background checks on all gun purchases!!
2914 2018-03-23 23:41:23 . You ost many of your base today. Going after bump stocks while signing a horrible bill with NO WALL! YOU BETRAY US ALL!
2915 2018-03-23 23:40:53 In business, one doesn't employ emotions just to gain. It needs logic. If BH is already in the stock market and sell shares, I may want to buy stocks (if I'm Korean and qualified) just coz they have BTS. I love BTS, but as an investor, I need to do my research first. Tbc
2916 2018-03-23 23:40:52 Because the NRA allowed Trump to ban them. 

Because bump stocks don't sell well 

Because a simple rubber band trick can be used to turn an AR into a machine gun
2917 2018-03-23 23:40:42 Obama did NOT legalize bump stocks! Trump....Lies....Again!
2918 2018-03-23 23:40:34 Bump stocks were meant for people that had a handicap and had a hard time squeezing the trigger...it used the recoil from the previous round to help pull the trigger for the next..  @LouDobbs @RealDrGina
2919 2018-03-23 23:40:23 I mean, can we just like, let this precedent pass? I truly do not care about bump stocks, I'm in it for that semi-automatic regulation.
2920 2018-03-23 23:40:11 so is murder.

You implied we should ban bump stocks b/c they could be used to infringe on anther's rights.  I have demonstrated that this applies to an unarmed man as well.

Your argument against the tool is shown to be invalid.
2921 2018-03-23 23:40:10 Bump stocks are just a toy accessory that you can waste ammo with! The gov shouldn't get involved!
2922 2018-03-23 23:39:58 guns ARE the problem, bump stocks make it worse.

#GunControlNow
2923 2018-03-23 23:39:58 I think your people are giving you bad advice about bump stocks. You can make a gun shoot faster with a belt. This is first step to banning all rifles.
2924 2018-03-23 23:39:50 Given that your reading skills are limited you might want to ask someone in your admin with knowledge to explain it to you, but Obama did not legalize Bump Stocks, though you did rescind his laws on mentally ill purchasing guns.
2925 2018-03-23 23:39:22 Bump stocks are not the problem and never have been. They're very overrated to start with!
2926 2018-03-23 23:39:22 @LouDobbs After what Trump has done to the US with the spending bill, who really cares about bump stocks. Trump is the new Schumer. PS, I listen to Dom every morning.
2927 2018-03-23 23:38:51 Loved the close up shot of @hollywills bare feet! You definitely should have done a game where you tickled their bare feet tho! I reckon a round called laughing stocks where they are tickled in stocks while answering questions 
2928 2018-03-23 23:38:50 We're chatting about capelin, northern cod stocks, and the DFO with @BillMontevecch. He says 'we have really great scientists' in that department, and he trusts their integrity and youth.
2929 2018-03-23 23:38:50 Okay, here's the thing. They have shareholders inside the company. But outsiders can only buy shares from the company if BH is already in the stock market, w/c is not happening yet. If your father is qualified to buy stocks from them, good. But I said investment is business. Tbc
2930 2018-03-23 23:38:47 How does banning bump stocks personally harm you? Isn’t it worth the sacrifice so Americans feel safer? Firing on full auto is a waste of ammo and very inaccurate...the only thing I can imagine is it gives you an hard-on.
2931 2018-03-23 23:38:43 Nice try. I mean it.
1. Obama did not legalize bump stocks.
2. You know this will be challenged in court and get tied up.
3. I’m guessing you told that to the NRA.
2932 2018-03-23 23:38:41 This is a gross mischaracterization, that you clearly got off a FOX NEWS feed. Bump stocks were not regulated at all & there was no law. They did allow two companies to sell product.  Obama issued a slew of executive orders promoting stricter gun control, which you rolled back.
2933 2018-03-23 23:38:35 Something interesting happened this week. 

Down stocks - #FANG (Multiples too high given FB news and breakup noise.)

Up stocks - $USO, $GLD, $TWMJF (weed), $BTC.

When the capital tied up in FANGs comes out is the market saying it goes into these?
2934 2018-03-23 23:38:28 Nice article, CNN would be so proud,  how about actually doing some research as to why bump stocks were made.
2935 2018-03-23 23:38:27 Instead of watching FOX before you tweet, why don't you READ? There were laws that wouldn't allow Obama to prohibit bump stocks sales.
2936 2018-03-23 23:38:18 You're being fed bad info. Our worst fears are being realized. You signed the bill. You gave away the store. Now you tweet about bump stocks? Save it. You were supposed to build the wall. Stop immigration. You're failing.
2937 2018-03-23 23:37:56 @hats off to @realDonaldTrump for banning bump stocks.  Something @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP did not have the courage to pass.
2938 2018-03-23 23:37:38 I’m with you on that one bump stocks I don’t like a good smi auto even at 62 I’m still an expert in military no one could beat my Score,was ask to be on riffle/pistol team I said no was recruited by Seal team as support they already had my record blue me away how they found me
2939 2018-03-23 23:37:28 People, banning bump stocks is a way for the NRA, Trump and others to save face and give up something that means diddly, You can bump fire any semi-automatic hand gun and rifle without the use of a bump stock, and sustain the same firing rate.

2941 2018-03-23 23:36:51 The NRA supported banning bump-stocks.
2942 2018-03-23 23:36:38 1 good one besides the defense stocks in another bad market day!
2943 2018-03-23 23:36:30 Not counting the time it takes to aim.
Adding a Bump Stock and No Aim Spray and Pray tactics would increase Rate of fire. Sadly more casualties.

THAT IS Why Bump stocks and High capacity Magazines 30/45 Stick mags and 50/ 100/250 Drums mags
Need to be OUTLAWED!
2944 2018-03-23 23:36:21 @LouDobbs Trump had more time to ban bump stocks & attack 2nd amendment,  than push his campaign agenda thru the omnibus bill. He has attacked the NRA & then backed off. He didn't have time to scrutinize the bill which has impact on his presidency ?. Instead he wants DACA amnesty
2945 2018-03-23 23:36:19 That’s not true.  The Obama administration didn't "legalize" bump stocks - they were already being sold. The Obama-era ATF decided in 2010 that bump stocks did not come under their regulatory authority. The Trump-era ATF said the same thing in 2017. Just in case you forgot.
2946 2018-03-23 23:36:17 Maybe you can negotiate Bump Stocks & DACA with Pres Trump.  He set a date to complete it, extended date, & wanted to include it in money bill. Yet Dems keep telling DACAs we will help, but won't talk to Pres. If DACA on table next year it will be 18 yrs of Dems working on it.
2947 2018-03-23 23:36:16 Sorry I thought you were replying to another tweet. Effectively to ban bump stocks tells me these are measures which go virtually all the way to achieving the objective. (I believe this is intended.) To effectively ban bump stocks = the objective will be achieved effectively.
2948 2018-03-23 23:36:12 Once again you are completely and utterly wrong! Obama didn't legalize bump stocks  They weren't even an issue until Vegas. Do you just randomly spew ignorance?
2949 2018-03-23 23:36:05 It's not precise nomenclature, the argument is not valid if definitions are muddled. The banning of bump stocks is significant because 'machine guns' are banned. It's the functioning of a weapon that is relevant. And in this case the nomenclature is relevant to 1) and 2)
2950 2018-03-23 23:36:01 I own an AR-15 I got last summer I don't need to turn it into a machine gun, bump stocks are dangerous and ppl upset by this should ask themselves WHY they need one!
2951 2018-03-23 23:35:33 For anyone interested in facts, the ATF did rule that certain bump stocks were not covered by existing law, but this is not legalisation.
2952 2018-03-23 23:35:27 - Trump will keep DACA for 800k in exchange for Border Wall
- Trump is ordering a Ban on Bump stocks
- McMaster resigned. Why are you complaining? 
- Trump wanted a more aggressive legal team. 
Stop distorting Ana. You’re a fake republican. No ones buying it anymore.
2953 2018-03-23 23:35:24 Getting phucked on my VA benefit' s  and now bump stocks. I am afraid to ask what else !
2954 2018-03-23 23:35:12 America's is way more important.
Stocks 50% over valued.
When those prices are cut to market value.
Debt overhang will cut another 50%.
So market is 75% over valued, which is in my range of fair market value.
2955 2018-03-23 23:35:07 I thought Obama was gonna take your guns? Now he’s too pro-gun with bump stocks? Which damn one is he? Make up your damn mind!
2956 2018-03-23 23:35:02 Ban the guns!!!!
I bet you don't ban bump stocks, you haven't got the balls!
2957 2018-03-23 23:35:01 Bump stocks are a non-issue. You can bump fire any semi-automatic without a bump stock. Bump stocks are only an issue among those lacking knowledge of firearms.
2958 2018-03-23 23:35:01 Um he is hurting me and my stocks right now.   The Stock Market has been very unstable lately or have you noticed the Dow?
2959 2018-03-23 23:34:47 Ohhh, I get I now... bump stocks and “stock” market.
2960 2018-03-23 23:34:41 Bump stocks .0001% Who cares! Worry about the 1.3 Trillion dollar budget you passed will do more harm than these bump stocks.
2961 2018-03-23 23:34:34 What about modern sporting rifles I use to hunt? What make an assault rifle an assault rifle? Bump stocks whatever we have background checks
2962 2018-03-23 23:34:26 Wow. Bad day for all stocks.
2963 2018-03-23 23:33:57 Guns don't kill people.
People kill people.

We need a ban on hollywood movies.  Not bump stocks!

Wish we could win.

Dems get more pork than if they had the power.  It is all a sham.  America doesn't have much more blood to bled.  

Very depressing today.  There isn't much left
2964 2018-03-23 23:33:46 I don't think ppl need bump stocks you should see the ppl now calling him dictator for banning something OBAMA made legal. Just attacked by Mark Pantero for disagreeing with him calling trump a dictator. I own an AR-15, I don't need to make it a machine gun.
2965 2018-03-23 23:33:26 "David Hogg" Thank you. DOJ banned bump stocks. Keep up the good work. Teachers across America are proud of you
2966 2018-03-23 23:33:12 No, the Obama Administration did not legalize Bump Stocks you moron. The ATF in 2010 replied to a question about what a bump stock was. It said a bump stock was a gun part, not a firearm under the existing law.
2967 2018-03-23 23:33:10 If I held a course teaching forex/stocks would you come?
2968 2018-03-23 23:33:01 Once again, bump stocks can be homemade! Stopping the sale of them will not do any good!!
2969 2018-03-23 23:33:01 Don't care about bump stocks. Non issue. Care about giving Dems everything they want. Go back up escalator. Talk is cheap.

2975 2018-03-23 23:32:02 Lol, how can you be mad about the fact that bump stocks are being banned?
2976 2018-03-23 23:31:40 They can have the bump stocks they want they are a piece of crap
2977 2018-03-23 23:31:39 Is the ban on bump stocks part of that bill?
2978 2018-03-23 23:31:30 No bump stocks were created by some out of the box thinkers who may or may not like shooting who saw a market for shooting enthusiasts who like to waste ammunition. Nothing more. Period.
2979 2018-03-23 23:31:17 He whiffed and missed.  The bump stocks were used in one event.  The facts of this particular event are still very questionable.  In essence he has started the country down the slippery slope of gun confiscation.
2980 2018-03-23 23:30:59 Looking for opinions, is the current downward movement in stocks actually a buying signal?
2981 2018-03-23 23:30:43 Nope, not true. The ATF determined that because bump stocks had no moving parts, they could not be regulated under existing law. This is another example of you twisting the truth to suit your current need. A clear cry to shift public opinion.
2982 2018-03-23 23:30:41 bump stocks are what Stephen Paddock, law abiding citizen and legal gun owner used to kill 58 people and injure hundreds more in las vegas last fall...

2984 2018-03-23 23:30:04 It’s a state issue, Obama had nothing to do with bump stocks. In fact it was the majority of republican who in their own states allowed them to be sold. No law was ever passed by the democrats. Stfu
2985 2018-03-23 23:29:53 The only folks who support him that are affected by stock market swings are  the very rich one's. Most of his supporters don't have a pot to pee in, and they certainly don't hold stocks, individually or in any kind of plan.
2986 2018-03-23 23:29:49 Bump Stocks DO NOT make a machine gun. Geez
2987 2018-03-23 23:29:39 The Obama administration did not approve bump stocks, instead determined that “current law did not allow for its regulation”.
2988 2018-03-23 23:29:29 The Molester-in-chief is really doing it to us.

2992 2018-03-23 23:28:44 Actually, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms determined in 2010 that because Bump Stocks are a firearm component, and not a firearm themselves, the Bureau could not regulate them. It’s not like Obama went out of his way to legalize them.
2993 2018-03-23 23:28:41 Wait - I thought Obama “legalized” bump stocks???
That’s the “100% true” Tweet that Orange Foolius put out there and you crept into my TL and defended.  

But you keep on deflecting...or go away - your choice.
2994 2018-03-23 23:28:38 Worst day bill slips thru, dems. You should take a minimum 7 days to have a bill reviewed. Bump stocks no big deal I can put my finger pants pocket and on my AR and do same thing. Love Trump but dems just got you.
2995 2018-03-23 23:28:35 US stocks suffer worst week in more than two years...
2996 2018-03-23 23:28:28 That’s how stupid these anti gun ppl are though. Bump stocks are cosmetic.. anything can be used to make it fire faster.
2997 2018-03-23 23:27:59 You do realize Bush legalized bump stocks after 9/11 ?
2998 2018-03-23 23:27:57 You should be scorching the president of the US for spending your tax money like mad and funding Planned Parenthood and giving amnesty for DACA and banning bump stocks and no wall...
2999 2018-03-23 23:27:45 LoL!  Took another massacre to convince this pres bump stocks needed banning.  Wasn’t enough that they were instrumental in a Vegas killing of many.  Still, took him weeks to move on ban.  And, now he just can’t resist blaming it all on 44.  Sad (joke)
3000 2018-03-23 23:27:43 House gives preliminary OK by vote of 85-59 to S.55 - widens background checks, increases age to buy firearm, limits magazine to 10 rounds, bans bump stocks #vtdigger #vtpoli
3001 2018-03-23 23:27:17 There has never been legislation for or against bump stocks, so it's kind if hard to blame Obama when you previously had done nothing about it either. By all means though, regulate them.
3002 2018-03-23 23:27:16 Hillary’s email server legalized gun stocks AND ended DACA. Try to keep up…
3003 2018-03-23 23:27:16 Uh, bump stocks became legal again after the assault weapons ban expired in 2004, dummy.

Pensions are gone so can't use the "it is going to hurt your retirement" argument.

A small minority of the population owns a majority of the stock.

Stocks go up when jobs are outsourced and wages cut.

 the stock market.
3007 2018-03-23 23:26:50 No one legalized bump stocks.  The ATF definition if semi auto is one trigger pull one bullet fired so it still fit the definition=legal
3008 2018-03-23 23:26:44 Obama bump stocks? Bad idea?  You are a bad idea
3009 2018-03-23 23:26:40 It would be a lot more than 0.05% if we were allowed to fish and manage and export our own stocks, and our fishermen hadn't been paid to destroy there own boats.
3010 2018-03-23 23:26:32 Obama administration didn't legalize bump stocks. As usual you are wrong. I really can't decide if you lie knowingly or if you are too ignorant to discern the truth.
3011 2018-03-23 23:26:16 Correction: GOP blocked any attempts during Obama administration to pass any laws that would ban bum stocks or have stronger gun control. So factually Obama’s failure is really the fault of republicans who sold out the country to NRA

@PrincipalMSD
To the students leading the fight, your influence made this possible. Your influence is saving lives.
“As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS...” - President Trump
3013 2018-03-23 23:25:53 Bump stocks are only part of the problem Donnie. It’s s small start, keep going and ban assault weapons that were never designed for common use. Grow a pair and stand up to the NRA. #AssaultWeaponsBan #RejecttheNRA
3014 2018-03-23 23:25:41 Need is absolutely needed. People have used planes and cars to commit terrorist attacks, but banning planes and cars is absurd and would do more harm than good. But banning bump stocks will do no harm.
3015 2018-03-23 23:25:33 You fucking turncoat piece of shit.  You just lost my vote.  Your ruling, if upheld, signifies that the text of a law means nothing, since a reading of the National Firearms Act CANNOT support classing bump stocks as machine guns.
3016 2018-03-23 23:25:33 Bump stocks should never have been legal in the first place...
3017 2018-03-23 23:25:31 2) Adam Winkler, a constitutional law professor at the University of California, LA, told PolitiFact that it is accurate to say the Obama administration approved the sale of bumps stocks. "Not because they liked it, but because the law did not permit them to prohibit it,"
3018 2018-03-23 23:25:04 And the gold mining stocks had their worst bear market ever between 2013 and now. 2014-16 majors were at 2001 lows.
3019 2018-03-23 23:25:02 Stop infringing on the people's right to bear arms please ... We need bump stocks and more to defend ourselves against criminal government who has nuclear bombs
3020 2018-03-23 23:25:00 Care to comment on the stock market? Do you even hold any stocks?
3021 2018-03-23 23:24:29 Trump Moves Closer To Banning Bump Fire Stocks GII
3022 2018-03-23 23:24:22 29,000  Russian Bots liked this post.... Not Me... the Words #ShallNotBeInfringed  still have a strong meaning in my life... Even tho Bumps Stocks are Dumb and Dangerous, I believe it is a violation of the 2nd Amendment
3023 2018-03-23 23:24:22 1) "In 2010 the Bureau Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives determined that because bump stocks don't have any moving parts, they are a "firearm part" could not be regulated as a firearm under existing gun laws. The ATF reached a similar conclusion in 2012.
3024 2018-03-23 23:24:19 旦那の予想では、今回は寸止めで日経平均は20,000円は割らないとのこと
3025 2018-03-23 23:24:03 Obama legalized bump stocks for military and police use orange, you're a disgrace.
3026 2018-03-23 23:23:51 See how the left backed off of bump stocks that quickly? They don’t care about bump stocks they want all guns banned. You can never please them, don’t try. #MAGA2018
3027 2018-03-23 23:23:40 おはよーございまーす
3028 2018-03-23 23:22:59 Obama did not LEGALIZE bump stocks. ATF decided it could not regulate bump stocks under the language of the law.
3029 2018-03-23 23:22:28 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS has slapped his supporters in the face today with the signing of the spending bill and announcement to ban bump stocks. No wall, increased spending, funding abortion, and weakening gun rights. #Liar #Disgrace #Omnibus #2ndamendment
3030 2018-03-23 23:22:23 No one cares about bump stocks. Make it as if the OBama Stain never was.
3031 2018-03-23 23:22:00 I could give a crap about bump stocks. They’re a novelty. The Vegas shooter used them the only way they could be effective. Hold center of a mass crowd and fire for effect.
3032 2018-03-23 23:21:58 Mr President do you really think banning bump stocks will keep them out of the hands of crooks and the bad guys?? No! You just took them away from law abiding citizens.
3033 2018-03-23 23:21:54 Lying again as usual. Bump stocks were a non issue when President Obama was in office. #NotMyPresident
3034 2018-03-23 23:21:28 This is it bump stocks, our you kidding? Oh remember 31 million from nra, forgot they tell you what to do!  You couldnt use those kind of weapons anyway, with those small hands , the weapon would kick out of your hands! Well maybe the nra will talk with the kids and get something
3035 2018-03-23 23:21:11 we are in a trade war with China and Japan.Face book stocks have gone lower.There are other reasons why this happened
3036 2018-03-23 23:21:11 Liberals don’t love bump stocks, liberals don’t typically love A.R. 15’s. He’s baiting you
3037 2018-03-23 23:21:11 NRA reads your tweets.  Plus it was Hillary’s emails that got bump stocks legalized
3038 2018-03-23 23:21:04 Only if you accept the fact that this weekend is about bump stocks because it is not...
3039 2018-03-23 23:21:02 Wait a minute....corps get tons of cash....Trump crashes market....Corporation now buy back stocks at lower prices.  Planned?
3040 2018-03-23 23:21:02 Non il est en commande , aujourd’hui les stocks ont été pillés
3041 2018-03-23 23:20:37 No but my car was built for transportation, bump stocks are built to kill a lot of people, period.
3042 2018-03-23 23:20:33 Machine guns are illegal. Fully automatic weapons have been illegal since 1934. Bump stocks bounce the 'one pull one bullet' semi automatic back into finger placement to quickly pull the trigger again, essentially making it an automatic weapon. The NRA is also against bump stocks
3043 2018-03-23 23:20:25 Are those now called Trump Stocks?
3044 2018-03-23 23:20:15 A strange day indeed. Trump piles on more debt, funding is banned from building a wall, tries to legalise DACA people and then tweets out about banning stocks. I was in line at 5:00am election day to be the 3rd threw the door to vote for him, WTF?
3045 2018-03-23 23:20:06 I follow Trump and I didn't see anything about Obama legalizing bump stocks - you are disinformation , bump stocks have been around longer than you. 
You are not old enough to remember. 
I think you are a commie Democrat.
I will be looking for you in Florida.
I want to talk.
3046 2018-03-23 23:19:54 Just watched NBC news(I know) and in the span of 20 minutes saw another story about Stormy Daniels, how Trump is screwing us due to the Trade war w China, David Hogg and the teenagers fighting guns and how revolutionary they are, bump stocks being banned.
3047 2018-03-23 23:19:49 Drunken Clams special in Guinness and ponzu butter sauce !!! While stocks last
3048 2018-03-23 23:19:30 Stocks are Dow Thanks Trump
3049 2018-03-23 23:19:27 THIS A BOLD FACE LIE OBAMA DID NOT APPROVE BUMP STOCKS quit playing partisan politics. Maybe you can learn facts from the marchers!
3050 2018-03-23 23:19:12 Bump stocks are not a magical part that make a legal weapon illegal. The same effect can be achieved with a finger. BANNING BUMP STOCKS IS A WASTE OF TIME AND RESOURCES.
3051 2018-03-23 23:19:08 That he then changes the narrative and starts attacking the 2A and bump stocks though? Insulting to his supporters who are already shaken by the Swampnibus bill signing! We got rolled by the establishment.
3052 2018-03-23 23:19:04 I don’t give a rip about bump stocks. I DO give a big rip about tax dollars going to sanctuary cities and planned parenthood. Disappointed does not even begin to describe my feelings.
3053 2018-03-23 23:18:45 I think we conservatives got played. We did not vote for Trump for him to sign out of control budgets and banning bump stocks. The Republicans are going to get rolled come November and the actually deserve it.#RHINOHUNT2018
3054 2018-03-23 23:18:42 On another stocks front, where are your tweets boasting about the fine job you are doing tanking the stock markets with your boneheaded tariffs that are stoking fears of a potential global trade war? Some negotiations tactic.
3055 2018-03-23 23:18:36 Why would an administrator legalize something like bump stocks? To what end?
3056 2018-03-23 23:18:16 He is giving these young people false hope when it comes to gun control. No matter how hard you try it will never work. Criminals don’t follow laws and banning little things like bump stocks isn’t going to do anything. Ex box take that away and you would have real change.
3057 2018-03-23 23:17:29 Did Obama legalize bump stocks before or after he was born in Kenya?
3058 2018-03-23 23:17:13 No one is blaming the gun. We just want it to be harder to obtain certain guns and to ban bump stocks.
3059 2018-03-23 23:17:12 Why didn't Obama ban bump stocks himself?  He could have done so with the stroke of a pen. Obama also had a majority in the House and Senate during part of his presidency, but did not restrict AR-15s.
Btw, I have two Master's degrees and my reading comprehension is perfect.
#KAG
3060 2018-03-23 23:17:01 Do you even trade stocks 
3061 2018-03-23 23:16:54 Omg my stocks lost50 cents tonight
3062 2018-03-23 23:16:48 We're are banning bump stocks in WA state.  Let's not forget that @Bush43 lifted the assault weapons ban in 9/04. He gets an assist in all the #AR-15 killings
3063 2018-03-23 23:16:42 Honestly, bump stocks are shit.
3064 2018-03-23 23:16:37 The take action trump administration. It’s been over 6 months since Las Vegas shooting and they finally decide to ban bump stocks. It’s a “dog and pony show.” Trying to make an impression before the march tomorrow.
3065 2018-03-23 23:16:16 He funded plan parenthood and lost funding on the border. How do think he’s going to fix this gargantuan mistake? Oh and on the same day he banned bump stocks and any sort of modification to rifles.
3066 2018-03-23 23:16:03 Was waiting for an explanation for the the next one... clearly hysteria around cryptos causing it was just that. I wanna know who's going first, time to short some stocks 
3067 2018-03-23 23:16:01 You mean the evil people who make bump stocks.
3068 2018-03-23 23:15:59 "The Obama administration approved the sale of bump fire stocks on at least two occasions."
— National Rifle Association on Thursday, October 5th, 2017 in a press release.                                               Listening to the NRA sir? It’s was the ATF’s choice.
3069 2018-03-23 23:15:39 Yeah ... no. The Obama Admin did not legalize bump stocks. Could you at least pretend to care about facts? FAKE NEWS!
3070 2018-03-23 23:15:24 Bump Stocks are not the problem here Mr. President. Please tell me what part of Shall not be infringed upon do you not understand. I did not vote for what you are currently doing.
3071 2018-03-23 23:15:22 Wondering if #ElonMusk told his financial advisor to sell out all his #Facebook stocks before deleting his companies' accounts on Facebook!
3072 2018-03-23 23:14:51 Obama didn't legalize bump stocks, his BATFE ruled they were legal under the law. You are now just interpreting the law incorrectly to appease the gun haters. So much for your promise to not undermine gun rights. #Liar
3073 2018-03-23 23:14:51 Who cares? Did he ban a specific gun? Bump stocks really don't do anything and are a moderate position. No one thought trump was a pure comservative.
3074 2018-03-23 23:14:13 I need to dig down into some more figures to decide what the story is but flat value is enough for me to want to do so (but not on a Friday night). 18 years of flat house prices would certainly be a story.
3075 2018-03-23 23:14:02 Obama did NOT legalize bump stocks. The gun industry took  advantage of a loophole in the law. They do that shit all the time. Bump stocks are fun toys. I’ve actually used one. Great way to wast your money in about 5 seconds. Totally unnecessary and there is no excuse to own one.
3076 2018-03-23 23:13:56 Why does EVERYTHING have to be a competition with you? Can't you just do your job and let your actions speak for themselves? I am thrilled that you're banning bump stocks, now let's ban assault weapons! Just do it, announce it & quit trying to compete w/President @BarackObama
3077 2018-03-23 23:13:49 NRA is skewing the past again. Obama didn't legalize bump stocks.  He couldn't make them illegal under current law. Obama ATF appointees were all blocked before 2013 by the NRA. now they try to make it look like his fault they are legal.
3078 2018-03-23 23:13:25 No, you never want to go all in with stocks
3079 2018-03-23 23:13:23 Market II: Put-call volume ratio has served as a good secondary indicator for contrarian moves. If put-call is above 1.15, then negativity is boiling among #options players; they're usually short #stocks. Usually a good time for institutions to step in and buy @IBDinvestors
3080 2018-03-23 23:13:20 Are you a pathological liar or are you that uninformed? Either is terrifying but it has to one. Under Obama the ATF said it did not have the authority to do anything about bump stocks they needed a law. Which is what congress does FYI but the @NRA paid off politicians wouldn’t
3081 2018-03-23 23:13:04 Bump Stocks can't be banned by Dept. of Justice. It doesn't fall under Firearms or the ATF National Firearm Act. It's a Part, like any part to anything else an it would take full Legislation to Ban it.When Asked: Ryan said:We will be looking at that. Machine Guns?They are banned!
3082 2018-03-23 23:12:59 Where is your proof #trump? I can prove that the Obama administration didn’t legalize bump stocks!
3083 2018-03-23 23:12:54 my stocks took a big hit today 
3084 2018-03-23 23:12:52 Problem is that deal was ALL give and NO take.  He is the only adult in the conversation, we rely on him to keep exactly this kind of crap from happening.  And then he follows it up announcing he is unilaterally banning bump stocks...which I immediately got on line and purchased.
3085 2018-03-23 23:12:33 Ban bump stocks,assault rifles a deadly weapons we don't need it
3086 2018-03-23 23:12:12 Bump stocks don't kill...
You want support? Don't give in. You always talk about how weak others are. You bowed down.
Weak. We lost a lot of hope today.
3087 2018-03-23 23:12:08 Nobody really cares about bump stocks. Liberals won’t be happy until every American is disarmed. That’s the goal.
3088 2018-03-23 23:12:04 Contrary to your thinking, size doesn't matter. Fisheries issue is about proper management of fisheries, stocks, not wasteful plundering & throwing back perfectly good catch.  Managing the environment long term & ensuring its future instead of EU pillaging. 1 fisherman=10?ankers
3089 2018-03-23 23:12:00 Ivanka has a scare with engine failure in a helicopter & the General is out & a BUSH era warmonger is in. Omnibust that pays for foreign countries walls but NOT ours passes. Bump stocks gonna be used to slip in MORE regs to strip more of #2A.  #MAGA is over people. #Bolton
3090 2018-03-23 23:11:55 Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.

— Donald J. Trump
3091 2018-03-23 23:11:49 6. dialogue across perspectives. What do you think of banning bump stocks?  What about having a license for a gun the way we do for a car?  What CAN you support?
3092 2018-03-23 23:11:48 How many died from bump stocks as opposed to @PPFA & illegals who are protected in #SanctuaryCities ? We feel betrayed sir. The @dnc will win in Nov & in 2020. I literally want to cry. - DC
3093 2018-03-23 23:11:41 @NRA Proud of your boy banning bump stocks what else will he do now ? what more will you let him get away with .. Did you not teach him what shall not be infringed ?
3094 2018-03-23 23:11:30 Our great team members are working hard now to make sure that our next week list should include the best stocks . We are trying our best and we will keep our promise . Thank you all V.I.P ,Gold and all other members for your awesome support .
3095 2018-03-23 23:11:30 Sure. Dont buy stocks any time in the next 2 years
3096 2018-03-23 23:11:29 Not sure bump stocks can be banned by the government, they can ban military style weapons, and that’s a start. BAN THE AR15!
3097 2018-03-23 23:11:20 This is a blatant lie, though we expect nothing better from you. Obama didn't legalize bump stocks. He would have done far more for gun control if the shady folks in the GOP didn't stop him at every turn. Also, bump stocks are only a small part of the problem. Ban assault weapons
3098 2018-03-23 23:11:15 Stop lying!  Obama admin did not legalize bump stocks.  And when will assault type weapons be outlawed?  What's the hold up?
3099 2018-03-23 23:11:07 I'm ok w/banning military style weapons & bump stocks. I'm not ok with revoking the right to keep & bear arms. I watch how our government & both parties have created a military style police state & I'll keep my weapons, thanks very much.
3100 2018-03-23 23:11:01 Trump picked an interesting time to make it such a high priority.  Either way bump stocks should be way down the list of priorities to fix this dumpster fire that is our federal government.
3101 2018-03-23 23:10:57 So, your argument of why you need bump stocks is so that you can kill tons of your fellow citizens? >_> Not what the founders had in mind with the 2nd amendment.
3102 2018-03-23 23:10:37 US #stocks decrease by 723.45 points after #tariffs on #China announced.
3103 2018-03-23 23:10:35 he said he was with us and for the second amendment.  And what does he do.

1.  Ban bump fire stocks
3104 2018-03-23 23:10:31 that is one of the strongest stocks in the mkt
3105 2018-03-23 23:10:29 Neither the ATF, nor Obama could have regulated Bump Stocks under current law. Bump Stocks are considered to be “parts,” and not subject to Federal Regulation.
3106 2018-03-23 23:10:14 Oh boy, Obama failed to ban bump stocks, Trump will. Remind me who's coming for the guns again?
3107 2018-03-23 23:10:13 A car or a rented truck are used for transportation. So they have another purpose. Bump stocks have 1 purpose: to kill a lot of people, period.
3108 2018-03-23 23:10:12 More damn lies! Obama administration did not make bump stocks legal.all of your tough talk but you afraid of the n.r.a. Grow a pair( or buy a pair) and ban assault rifles!
3109 2018-03-23 23:09:35 you're oversimplifying different issues.  bump stocks was a  mistake, but not important until Las Vegas.  Obama worked for common sense gun reforms after sandy hook.  to say anyone is not concerned about gun violence in Chicago is a sign of your own ignorance
3110 2018-03-23 23:09:20 Biggest f’ up of his presidency. He signed his impeachment papers today. And then starts tweeting about an unconstitutional ban on bump stocks. Epic fail.
3111 2018-03-23 23:08:57 I don't CARE about bump stocks! The Second Amendment is about being able to confront the forces of tyranny! It's not about target shooting, or hunting, or personal protection. Focus on things that WILL make a difference: mental care, linked reporting systems, morality!
3112 2018-03-23 23:08:33 That is why stocks market is completely Red it’s down, because what ever you say or do the market doesn’t trust you.
3113 2018-03-23 23:08:33 I think the ATF under the Obama administration decided that bump stocks were not under their jurisdiction and so they could not regulate them. So this is like 40% true.
3114 2018-03-23 23:08:21 Maybe the general public shouldn't be able to buy bump stocks, but I think there should be places where those who want to can fire fully automatic weapons. It's fun.
3115 2018-03-23 23:08:12 Are you really arguing that there were NO mass shootings because there were no bump stocks?? There were Thompson Machine guns that used 45 CALIBER bullets for crying out loud! What will your next excuse be?
3116 2018-03-23 23:08:11 Another lie. The Obama administration did not legalize bump stocks. Can you go maybe one day without a blatant lie?
3117 2018-03-23 23:08:07 Why do people need bump stocks? I seriously don't understand the reasoning behind them.
3118 2018-03-23 23:08:04 Did bump stocks “remain legal” under Obama,  or were they illegal then MADE LEGAL under Obama? 
There’s a big difference.  
Trump says “B”.  It’s a lie.  
Read it again ...

3119 2018-03-23 23:07:53 Bump stocks do NOT convert semiauto firearms into fully automatic firearms.
Get expert advice, then if u want limit them to those with physical disability. For others have Congress put them under NFA.
3120 2018-03-23 23:07:36 Also...I guess you mean @realDonaldTrump unless you are FOR bump stocks.
3121 2018-03-23 23:07:29 I rather lose playing stocks than have all my money sit in the savings and watch myself barely get 0.001 interest rate every year. meanwhile the bank getting rich off me
3122 2018-03-23 23:07:20 Might need that since your president is trashing my stocks.
3123 2018-03-23 23:07:19 Stocks are less risky when you have designated "gamble" money in it and not your rent money or expense money
3124 2018-03-23 23:07:18 Laugh, this is just the beginning....He has no constitutional authority to ban bump stocks on his own. That's what dictators do.
3125 2018-03-23 23:07:15 Obama did not approve nor Legalize Bump Stocks.  His administration simply found that the current LAWS did not prohibit them.
Obama tried for gun control but the GOP pushed back every time
tell the truth for Once in your life!!!!!
 Stop your BLATANT lies!
3126 2018-03-23 23:07:06 So u solved it. Assuming spiking libor panics stock markets, then it is a vicious cycle: stocks sell off, lower tax receipts, higher T issuance, more businesses crowded out into CP which raises Libor, rinse and repeat. 

So govt spending has to go down or stocks can’t recover
3127 2018-03-23 23:06:53 I agree with you but today when Trump signed that bill, Americans were not only NOT FIRST but dead last. He shouldn't have signed it. Then he turns right around and bans bump stocks.....we could be headed toward socialism if this keeps up.
3128 2018-03-23 23:06:49 My stocks look dreadful as well... Guess I just won't retire...
3129 2018-03-23 23:06:44 Well well....the US Justice Dept banned "bump stocks"...what will they ban next......"fast fingers"?...when will the madness stop?
3130 2018-03-23 23:06:35 #1. STOP Invoking Obama’s Name, In Ur Mishaps! Ur The 1, Who PROMISED That U Were Going 2 Implement Common Sense Gun Reform! Ur The 1, Who LIED 2 Those Kids! #2. Bum Stocks WASN’T The Cause For 17 People Losing Their Lives, In FL! We Want Assault Rifles Gone! #LIARINCHIEF
3131 2018-03-23 23:06:14 Stocks are risky when you get greedy
3132 2018-03-23 23:06:12 Good move on the bump stocks, but just the tip of the iceberg.
Meanwhile are you insanely fighting against the past administration, which is done and gone?
Give it up old man, look forward like an actual President is supposed to.
3133 2018-03-23 23:06:04 Sorry, but bump stocks do not make a semi auto into a full auto......  maybe #fullsemiauto
3134 2018-03-23 23:06:01 Here's the issue of the moment! Trump blames Obama for legalizing bump stocks in a tweet. Is he right? - USA TODAY
3135 2018-03-23 23:05:49 I notice when a clip of President Obama is played my body posture changes, I sit up, chest protruding. I’m proud. 
When you’re on TV I tense up, get disgusted, then pine for the “old days.”
Btw, Obama didn’t legalize bump stocks, asshole!
3136 2018-03-23 23:05:47 You are clueless. Republican George Bush legalized bump stocks. Stop trying to blame stuff on Obama. He is 100 times the man you will ever be!
3137 2018-03-23 23:05:46 And the very next day Trump Bans Bumb Stocks as Q would say. Coincidence????
3138 2018-03-23 23:05:44 Bump Stocks? You got played...thanks for nothing. 1.3 trillion more dollars in the hole. Your such a great negotiator<—-( sarcasm). Just a prediction...Democrats win the midterms and your impeached.
3139 2018-03-23 23:05:38 PA school district stocks classrooms with rocks, to combat school school shooters.
OK, is PA for real?
3140 2018-03-23 23:05:30 My account was green today. Canadian weed stocks, pet stocks, $gld and 88% cash. I am not a player
3141 2018-03-23 23:05:30 No, the Republican congress legalized bump stocks after spending the huge donations they receives from the NRA. You did nothing to stop them from being sold for how months after the Vegas shooting. If you are so anti bump stocks, squash the comment period. You won't.
3142 2018-03-23 23:05:29 Semi-automatic weapons are as much a culprit as automatic.  If guns weren’t semi-automatic, bump stocks wouldn’t work.
3143 2018-03-23 23:05:28 ONE is going to be monitoring and selling stocks for ONE's husband and ONE too
3144 2018-03-23 23:05:24 I personally do not care at all about bump stocks and I do not love  and do not care about DACA.
3145 2018-03-23 23:05:17 Dear @realDonaldTrump , I've been a supporter for some time but this is probably the darkest day of your Presidency.  Not only do you go back on a slew of campaign promises with the Omnibus you announce plans to ban bump stocks.  I just ordered mine, thanks for the heads up.
3146 2018-03-23 23:05:15 Mr. President I don’t give a shit about bump stocks! Why didn’t you veto the spending bill?
3147 2018-03-23 23:04:53 Well we do have to follow our own inner voices. Personally I could give a crap about bump stocks. Never heard of them until Vegas massacre. I think I get where you are coming from. Take a little till it becomes a lot. Trump isn't perfect but we all knew that when we voted.
3148 2018-03-23 23:04:51 The Parkland shooter didn’t use bump stocks you stupid SOB. You haven’t done a thing to address what happened to Parkland aside from a stupid meet-and-greet that you couldn’t even get through without a note card telling you to say “I hear you”.
3149 2018-03-23 23:04:47 Mr President, you’re so smart. Why do you keep saying stupid stuff? 
1) No administration ever ‘legalized’ bump stocks. They were simply never illegal. 
2) Bump stocks do not turn semi-automatic rifles into machine guns. It’s still one shot per pull of the trigger.
3150 2018-03-23 23:04:36 Noo trump! my boy! My precious bump stocks! One day I'll be super rich and be able to afford automatic weapons, shoot them at the home made range I made, far from the local populace. I'd build this compound in Texas. Waco Texas. Surely nothing could go wrong in this endeavor!
3151 2018-03-23 23:04:33 If you allow a nan of bump stocks, the next step will be modified triggers that allow smoother action. These are used by competition shooters, like those on our Olympic team. A ban like this is just a step toward repeal of the 2nd ammendment.
3152 2018-03-23 23:04:31 @allahpundit @KT_So_It_Goes NRA and it’s spokespeople have been weirdly silent about Trump’s executive order banning bump stocks.
3153 2018-03-23 23:04:28 Cannibal stocks outlook way up!
3154 2018-03-23 23:04:27 Yes bump stocks and Gatling triggers should definitely be banned because they really have no use other than evil. I owned one for my rifle and there is 0 accuracy with it so it’s only good for shooting in a crowd
3155 2018-03-23 23:04:09 So, what state was it that was negligent in allowing the worst shooting in the country ?
Go, ahead outlaw butt stocks in Nevada. 
Outlaw fifty guns in your hotel rooms, while you’re at it.
3156 2018-03-23 23:04:02 صباح الخير أخوي عبدالعزيز ... تابعنا توجد أكواد قريباً
3157 2018-03-23 23:04:00 I own guns, a few ar's. I have never ever seen the use or purpose in bump stocks other that to dump ~$15-30 in ammo. Some may shoot cheaper shit, but again, what's the point. Honestly.
3158 2018-03-23 23:03:47 Winkler told the fact-checking organization, which explored the issue after the National Rifle Associated said the in October that the Obama administration approved bump stocks on two occasions.
3159 2018-03-23 23:03:45 everytime the president announces or passes legislation, my stocks go down :(((
3160 2018-03-23 23:03:44 You are as good as your word President Trump.  Bump stocks are not necessary in hunting unless you have trouble hitting the side of a barn.
3161 2018-03-23 23:03:42 Let’s be truthful now. As you are about to find out, bump stocks, under current law, could not be considered a firearm, therefore the ATF felt I couldn’t pass law on it. And can you guess why Obama couldn’t issue new legislation? Because repubs blocked him every chance they got!
3162 2018-03-23 23:03:38 You do realize that was just to shut them up? Bump stocks suck!
3163 2018-03-23 23:03:38 There's a difference between banning fertilizer and banning bump stocks. There is no reason to own a bump stock, while fertilizer is very important for farming, something people need to survive.
3164 2018-03-23 23:03:33 I don’t care for bump stocks, but I do care for the Constitution, the 2nd Amendment, and Shall Not Be Infringed! You people are working on the wrong problem... it’s not the tool, it’s the behavior. And specifically it’s what created the behavior!
3165 2018-03-23 23:03:23 Love you Trump but banning bump stocks is not a popular idea for those of us in the know.  I can bump fire with my belt loop.  Gonna ban that too and make my pants fall down?  You can't regulate crazy people away.
3166 2018-03-23 23:03:22 Adam Winkler, a constitutional law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, told PolitiFact that it is accurate to say the Obama administration approved the sale of bumps stocks. 

"Not because they liked it, but because the law did not permit them to prohibit it
3167 2018-03-23 23:03:11 Worried about your gun stocks?
3168 2018-03-23 23:03:08 Sorry Bub.  Thought you were joining this conversation with us and Trump.  About bump stocks.  Didn't realise you were just wandering around talking to yourself.  Don't let us keep you.  We'll be starting our literacy class soon.
3169 2018-03-23 23:03:03 Why did Trump exploit the Parkland school shooting false flag to ban bump stocks? Nobody forced him to do this. He did it willingly and purposefully. He did what none of us would ever do. Whose side is Trump on?
3170 2018-03-23 23:03:02 Are you trying to say that bump stocks were @ 1 time illegal & the Obama administration reversed that? I highly doubt that.  More likely there has never been any discussion  re bump stocks until the LV shooting.
3171 2018-03-23 23:02:53 Sad that 11 people liked this post. Are you that naive to believe that Republicans and Democrats aren't batting for the same team? Do you really think a ban on bump stocks will reduce gun violence? Your government is not serving you, they're serving corporate interest.
3172 2018-03-23 23:02:42 @Stonekettle can you believe this? now he wants to blame bump stocks on @BarackObama since he is taking a beating on signing the Omnibus bill that his base hated.
3173 2018-03-23 23:02:24 After Bill Clinton banned assault weapons in 1994, mass shooting deaths dropped by 43%. After the Republican Congress let the ban expire, they shot up by 239%. Obama didn’t legalize bump stocks, #LiarInChief #GunReformNow
3174 2018-03-23 23:02:16 I’m not disputing it’s factually correct. However, if you want income, FTSE 100 equities have yielded 3%ish over the period? If you want growth (reinvested divs) then it’s returned 90%ish (from previous tweet)? So what’s the story really?
3175 2018-03-23 23:02:00 more fake news, the republicans under Bush legalized bump stocks after Clinton had made them illegal.
3176 2018-03-23 23:01:56 WHY WHY didn’t you VETO?!?!?!
I lost $40,000 + on my retirement in stocks WHY WHY WHY Can I trust you anymore?what happen to MAGA
3177 2018-03-23 23:01:43 Libel does not result in dozens and dozens of people DEAD, bump stocks can and do. I really hate these idiotic comparisons that worshipers of the Church of the Holy Gun come up with.
3178 2018-03-23 23:01:41 Please don't. Nowhere in the Constitution does it say we can't have bump stocks. There is no problem with bump stocks. It's not a machine gun, and it's not illegal. Stop what you're doing, and focus on something else. Guns are not an issue
3179 2018-03-23 23:01:40 It's about firing at a faster rate. Bump stocks cause more human death per second than unmodified semi-autos
3180 2018-03-23 23:01:38 [Business meeting]
Guy 1: So like, I don't know what to do with these stocks yknow? Keep em or sell em?
Guy 2: Well, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
Guy 1: ...
Guy 2: what
Guy 1: Do I look like a fucking hunter?
3181 2018-03-23 23:01:35 No, the Obama administration did not legalize bump stocks.  They determined that under the law these things were not subject to regulation.  Which means, the law itself should have been changed which falls to Congress which was Republican majority.
3182 2018-03-23 23:01:27 Trump said Obama Administration legalized bump stocks, which is not What happened.
3183 2018-03-23 23:01:25 Stocks down big because up big! Also stock funds have to pay their quarterly taxes so this not unusual even though the gloom & doom forecasters are out there!
3184 2018-03-23 23:01:14 You might want to keep one of them bump stocks around because when your wife sees what's on that CD she's coming after you with everything she got. I hope she cleans you out
3185 2018-03-23 23:01:13 Maybe ban the high caliber weapons and not just the stocks that fit on them. People use the excuse "more background checks!" Well, people can be sane one year and completely insane the next. You want less gun violence? You need less guns., anything less is a pitiful response.
3186 2018-03-23 23:01:04 Uhhhhh bump stocks aren't a right.
3187 2018-03-23 23:00:59 I understand facts don’t matter to you or your deplorables but again you are lying. President Obama did not legalize bump stocks. He was actually prevented from banning them. Nice try though.....
3188 2018-03-23 23:00:55 Constantly changing my look on Twitter in hopes to increase my social media stocks
3189 2018-03-23 23:00:45 STOP BLAMING OBAMA. YOU ARE THE SUCH A LIAR. HE DID NOT LEGALIZE BUMP STOCKS AND YOU KNOW IT. PLEASE STOP THIS MADDNESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

3191 2018-03-23 23:00:37 1 year+ of Trump & Bump stocks are still legal.
WHAT are you waiting for? another massacre?? @davidfrum @nytdavidbrooks @colbertlateshow @jimcarrey
3192 2018-03-23 23:00:34 bump stocks do NOT turn guns into machine guns! #LearnTheTruth!! Stop buying the bull!!
3193 2018-03-23 23:00:09 WTF is wrong with you? Can't you have an original thought or policy without referencing your predecessor? And the Obama admin did not "legalize" bump stocks, but noted that it would take an act of Congress to bqn them in the face of 2nd Amendment protests and lawsuits.
3194 2018-03-23 22:59:57 You know the NRA questioned why ATF found them compliant and legal right?  Where had NRA supported bump stocks and to what degree?
3195 2018-03-23 22:59:44 BAD IDEA. BUMP STOCKS BAN
3196 2018-03-23 22:59:35 @maddow hey let your people know jim cramer and the rest of us think #trump is short stocks and should be investigated on that tell meller
3197 2018-03-23 22:59:21 Didn't you undo the law  President Obama signed for mentally challenged people not to get guns! Also President Obama tried to ban assault rifles after Santa Barbara and you Republicans said NO! If you think that bump stocks are the real issue then you really do not have a clue!!
3198 2018-03-23 22:59:10 Banning bump stocks also

3200 2018-03-23 22:59:06 "Obama legalized bump stocks!??" Have you totally lost your mind Sir? Nobody ever even heard of them until Vegas.
3201 2018-03-23 22:59:01 Well I just read you are off to FL. You will miss the March tomorrow. Find it very interesting you don’t have to courage to meet with or listen to teenagers. Banning bump stocks is NOT enough
3202 2018-03-23 22:58:55 Except that bump stocks do no such thing. Like Obama, this lying, swampy @POTUS is pushing for more gun control, more debt, more Planned Parenthood & sanctuary city funding, WALLS for Jordan & Tunisia not USA; @SenSchumer & @NancyPelosi just schooled you on the Art of the Deal 
3203 2018-03-23 22:58:47 Our guns aren’t out of control; our kids are and yet you’re all for banning bump stocks?  Seems like an inconsistent message.  I’m not advocating for bump stocks, but I am against the slippery slope.
3204 2018-03-23 22:58:41 I'm afraid there's no stores within a 15 miles radius that stocks this item. Aisha
3205 2018-03-23 22:58:39 He's a pathalogical liar! He lied in 2 of his tweets just today! Saying Democrats don't want DACA when he was the one that ended the program! Saying Obama legalized bump stocks was another lie! You'd have to be deaf, mute and blind not to see this!
3206 2018-03-23 22:58:36 Another Trump lie.  The Obama administration did not legalize bump-stocks.
3207 2018-03-23 22:58:36 Bump stocks cannot change a firearm to fully automatic.
3208 2018-03-23 22:58:30 I don't like bump stocks either, but I SUPPORT the 2nd ammendment, unlike a certain President who lied about his support of gun owners to win an election.
3209 2018-03-23 22:58:00 Definition of plunges open for debate. 10% in a couple of months might well fit though. Could certainly have used decimated. Rest of the tweet was fact. As I've said elsewhere I'm a fan of equities but doesn't mean isn't worth thinking about even if all says is market crazy in 99
3210 2018-03-23 22:57:58 Folks bitching at Trudeau for issuing this statement...

Say what you will, but at least you don't have a leader who, instead of condemning this attack, blamed the previous president for legalizing bump stocks instead.

HINT: The previous president didn't do that.
3211 2018-03-23 22:57:57 Why no ban on assault weapons, not just bump stocks?
3212 2018-03-23 22:57:56 @realDonaldTrump I'm a gun owner and believe in 2ndA, but I am all for banning bump stocks, and very extensive background and mental evals for ownership. Good move on the ban of bumps!!!
3213 2018-03-23 22:57:42 Obama admin. did not "legalize"  bump stocks. They could not make them illegal under current law. HUGE difference. You greatly overstated the actions of the Obama admin.
3214 2018-03-23 22:57:33 Obama DID NOT legalize bump stocks like Trump just Tweeted.  The law simply did not allow Obama to prohibit bump stocks.  If congress wanted to regulate them they could have.  President Trump is WRONG! Bump stocks weren't considered an issue until after the Vegas shootings.
3215 2018-03-23 22:57:33 Trump lost me today now he's pushing to ban bump stocks that have only been used once and can be made easily with a belt loop or strap. He has gone off the rails and sounds more like Obama than the trump I voted for... He's now morphed into the swamp
3216 2018-03-23 22:57:25 So he’s banning bump stocks that were indeed legalized under the Obama administration and leftists still go nuts...   
3217 2018-03-23 22:57:20 Obama Adm did not legalize bump stocks.
Another one of your big fat lies.
3218 2018-03-23 22:57:11 How many people are killed by bump stocks? Wow. I'm disappointed.
3219 2018-03-23 22:57:01 It’s not bump stocks. Bump Stocks do not kill people. I voted for you but I have my doubts about where you are going! In one day you funded Planned Parenthood and started chipping away at the 2nd Amendment. Who is giving you advice?? #WorriedAboutTrump

3221 2018-03-23 22:56:53 Bump stocks are the least of your worries since you signed the spending bill giving Democrats all they wanted and screwing your supporters over!
3222 2018-03-23 22:56:46 Ooh, big deal. You also promised a wall. And to defund sanctuary cities and Planned Parenthood. End chain migration. We got bump stocks. Wow. And we thought we elected a man with a spine.
3223 2018-03-23 22:56:46 That may be, but "without bump stocks" semiautomatic weapons are still implements of mass destruction albeit on a small scale. 

Thus this proposed "reform" is form over substance.
3224 2018-03-23 22:56:43 Obama did not, did not legalize bump stocks you are wrong try to blame him again
3225 2018-03-23 22:56:35 I remember this. Obama was wearing a tan suit, eating fancy mustard in the Rose Garden and signing the bill to legalize BUMP STOCKS.
3226 2018-03-23 22:56:35 It just really gets under your skin that you will never get the approval that you so desperately seek. Obama never legalized bump stocks and you know it but then again, lying is all you know how to do.
3227 2018-03-23 22:56:34 Thoughts and prayers go out to those of you who can't buy bump stocks anymore
3228 2018-03-23 22:56:31 In 2010 the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives determined that because bump stocks don't have any moving parts, they are a "firearm part" could not be regulated as a firearm under existing gun laws. The ATF reached a similar conclusion in 2012.
3229 2018-03-23 22:56:17 From what I watched last year I thought our stocks looked very promising. I hope they're given a chance. If they can't after a 54 point loss, when?
3230 2018-03-23 22:56:16 You can’t even get your own facts straight. He didn’t LEGALIZE them. On 2 occasions, they weren’t able to prohibit them because of how laws were written. It was not a reflection on his stance on bump stocks or guns. You can’t even do something right without blaming him. 
3231 2018-03-23 22:56:08 He didn’t legalize bump-stocks. That is a flagrant lie. Read other posts that explain the historical truth.
3232 2018-03-23 22:56:02 Err no Obama did not legalise bump stocks at all. The law stopped him from prohibiting them. If Congress had wanted to prohibit them they could have. You are a ridiculous man and so full of shit.
3233 2018-03-23 22:55:59 Disagreeing with bump stocks doesn't make me a cultist, sounds like you are a bit of an alt righter though.
3234 2018-03-23 22:55:51 WRONG!! The Obama administration didn't "legalize" bump stocks - they were already being sold. The Obama-era ATF decided in 2010 that bump stocks did not come under their regulatory authority. The Trump-era ATF said the same thing in 2017.
3235 2018-03-23 22:55:33 That is true.  BUT BUMP STOCKS ARE A WRONG THAT NEEDS TO BE SET STRAIGHT
3236 2018-03-23 22:55:24 if a bump stock is that easy to make yourself, unfortunately, that's the best argument to why they should be banned. not only do bump stocks need to be banned but manufacturer's need to design them differently so they cannot be faux made easily.
3237 2018-03-23 22:55:22 "Obama Administration legalized bump stocks.". Prove your statement please.
3238 2018-03-23 22:55:21 LYING TRUMP! Obama didn't legalize bump stocks. There was a determination in 2010 that current law didn’t allow for its regulation.
Obama issued executive orders promoting stricter gun control, which Trump has rolled back, including preventing the mental ill from buying guns.
3239 2018-03-23 22:55:17 Another lie. Obama did not authorize bump stocks. ATF said it wasn't under their jurisdiction just like they told you. Or did you forget they told you that in 2017? Your decision will be tied up in court for years when the NRA sues saying you have no authority. Pass a law instead
3240 2018-03-23 22:55:07 Obama definitely didn't legalize bump stocks. The law did not allow the administration to prohibit them.
3241 2018-03-23 22:55:03 Obama did not legalize bump stocks!! Do your homework!!
3242 2018-03-23 22:54:59 We are talking about bump stocks dude. You conflate it to mean you have to give up your guns. NO ONE wants that.
3243 2018-03-23 22:54:57 "No one knows and no one cares about your world of stocks and shares in Pearl City!"
3244 2018-03-23 22:54:45 Re bump stocks: the Executive branch is specifically prohibited from making anything "illegal" - that is Congress' full duty. When will Congress begin issuing articles of impeachment against @POTUS for his unconstitutional acts? @RepThomasMassie @Jim_Jordan @marklevinshow
3245 2018-03-23 22:54:44 banning bump stocks is the BAD IDEA..
3246 2018-03-23 22:54:43 I think something about BUMP STOCKS. Must be capitalized though or it doesn’t count.
3247 2018-03-23 22:54:39 Normalement, les livrets de famille remis depuis le mariage pour tous mentionnent parent 1 et parent 2. Peut être que Paris liquide ses vieux stocks ? 
3248 2018-03-23 22:54:38 Has this been confirmed ?

wonder if there is a quantity limit to test samples until it becomes labled stocks 

also wonder if test samples big enough to administer that is reported to effect 3 people.
3249 2018-03-23 22:54:27 Wrong. 

@BillClinton banned assault rifles, GOP reinstated them. 

@SenFeinstein tried to ban bump stocks in 2012, GOP blocked it.  

Notice a pattern?
3250 2018-03-23 22:54:19 damn jeff sessions is banning bump stocks. wow. they did something........right?
3251 2018-03-23 22:54:17 Obama wasn’t allowed to stop bump stocks because they are considered attachments and not fire arms.
3252 2018-03-23 22:54:16 He's lying Obama didn't legalize bump stocks. Jeez, you people will believe anything.
3253 2018-03-23 22:54:09 Not super proud of this, but for like the first week people were talking about banning bump stocks, I thought it was some financial thing.
3254 2018-03-23 22:54:05 They never "legalized" bump stocks you liar. They are a firearm accessory that was always legal.
3255 2018-03-23 22:53:43 Just curious. I must look and see what the value of the CBC stocks are on the TSX. OMG I can't find them. Zero.
3256 2018-03-23 22:53:41 Bump stocks are irrelevant. If you want to find out what happened in Vegas put @LauraLoomer on the case as a Chief White House independant investigator. She'll get the job done!!
3257 2018-03-23 22:53:28 Bump stocks. Big deal.
3258 2018-03-23 22:53:24 I seem to remember you saying this when 50 people were killed in Las Vegas.

Then you cowered in front of the gun lobbyists and did nothing to ban bump stocks.

I expect nothing from you but grifting, lies, and acting like a baby. And so far I’ve been right. #CowardlyConman
3259 2018-03-23 22:53:20 Btw your own tweet supports my previous tweet ..bump stocks are a device not a fire arm and thus were not addressed in the law re illegal fire arms.
3260 2018-03-23 22:53:16 I thought you said dump stocks.
You fool!
3261 2018-03-23 22:53:00 NO BUMP STOCKS 
I AM THE NRA
3262 2018-03-23 22:52:54 Real...bump stocks after that shitty bill you signed today!!! you gave the democrats everything they wanted you sold out shame on you 45 stop tweeting and enjoy your  time with your family sell out #boycott 2018# boycott2020
3263 2018-03-23 22:52:51 I’m losing money like a MF with my stocks!!!!! 
3264 2018-03-23 22:52:49 .@realDonaldTrump WhY mY sToCkS aLl CrAsHiNg?!?!?
3265 2018-03-23 22:52:49 AS IF OBAMA LEGALIZED BUMP STOCKS ..LMFAO You failed your party today...what a Surprise..sad
3266 2018-03-23 22:52:47 Bump stocks do not turn weapons into machine guns. All they do is make them shoot faster. It is still one trigger pull, one bullet.
3267 2018-03-23 22:52:42 Is this banning the sale of bump stocks or just possession of them?
3268 2018-03-23 22:52:31 And then he lies, and says that Obama legalized bump stocks.

Obama only announced that there were no laws against them, and every thing he tried to do, the GOP shut down.
3269 2018-03-23 22:52:30 Bump stocks are not arms and this maybe part and parcel in regulating a militia well. ( so it doesn't infringe on your right to bear arms) maybe you should read the second amendment. Hey why do you suppose it's called an amendment?
3270 2018-03-23 22:52:18 We didn't vote for you to ban bump stocks, you should have vetoed this turkey, build the wall, kick out illegals, you have seriously hurt your base.
3271 2018-03-23 22:52:13 So saving kids lives is less important? You aren’t giving up “your freedom” by not having access to bump-stocks. Nobody wants your freedom or your guns. Get over it.
3272 2018-03-23 22:52:10 First of all, the Obama Administration did not legalize bump stocks.

Second, is the mandated comment period intended to give some gun nut in your administration the chance to talk you out of the ban?

Third, why should anyone believe anything you say, ever?
3273 2018-03-23 22:52:07 Lol actually it's Trump and Sessions banning bump stocks
3274 2018-03-23 22:52:05 Trump banning bump stocks cuz ... 1.) Obama didn’t (cuz it is an inexpensive tool 4 his pet terrorist mass killers,circumnavigating law)   2.) NRA cool w/it in terms of consistency of existing automatic rifle law’s intent. It does make my 2A spidey senses tingle, but I’ll live
3275 2018-03-23 22:52:02 If I am not mistaken the #Parkland shooter did not USE BUMP STOCKS and still managed to you kill 17 ppl. I know this may not go well for #Trumpsters but at least it is a step. There needs to be more change. The 2A was created 200 yrs ago, and it's time to amend these rights.
3276 2018-03-23 22:51:56 The Obama administration didn't have a law to use to ban them, and with a #gop congress, not chance of getting a law passed. ATF said bump stocks are not a firearm for them them to regulate.  #lyingDon
3277 2018-03-23 22:51:55 #PresidentChaos thinks it's all about bump stocks. That's like saying since hammers can hurt you, we are banning nails. Young ones: VOTE THEM OUT, GOP especially, but even Dems who think every home should bear arms. #VoteThemOut2018 #VoteThemOut2020
3278 2018-03-23 22:51:53 Oh calm down, a dictator really? I'm 2nd ammend I don't think ppl need bump stocks! Shut the hell up!
3279 2018-03-23 22:51:44 No, Donald. NO. Bump/fire stocks were already legal. The law did not permit President Obama to prohibit them. Understand? He introduced MANY gun regulations, which your administration is rolling back. Sleep well, dotard.
3280 2018-03-23 22:51:34 @realDonaldTrump today funded @PPFA accepted a fraction of wall cost,expressed frustration at lack of helping DACA recipients,passd CLOUD act which eliminates online privacy,DOJ banned bump stocks and all of them continue 2 lick Putins ass!#tRumpsCult tell me ur values again
3281 2018-03-23 22:51:30 It would also give stocks time to rebuild?
3282 2018-03-23 22:51:25 Bump stocks are definitely part of the problem
3283 2018-03-23 22:51:21 Barack Obama didn't receive $30 million dollars from the NRA to fund his campaigns but you did, he urged Congress to pass a legislation to get gun control but Republicans and some Democrats opposed so don't come and say to ban bump stocks is enough.
3284 2018-03-23 22:51:21 Not true. Companies created bump stocks and Obama couldn't regulate them because they aren't an actual firearm and don't fall under NTSB guidelines. Please stop lying. You're just trying to turn attention away from the $30 million your greedy, small hands took from the NRA.
3285 2018-03-23 22:51:18 Bearish on bump stocks.
3286 2018-03-23 22:51:16 Obama admin ok'd bump stocks.
3287 2018-03-23 22:51:08 Donnie, guess what?  Most things you hear on Fox News are not true.  The Obama administration did not legalize bump stocks, it simply determined there were no existing laws that could be used to prohibit them.  With NRA lock on Repubs in congress, there was no chance to rectify
3288 2018-03-23 22:50:57 Im quite sure there are stocks of not yet printed which could still be used. Maybe not. In any case the colour is irrelevant. Only the words are.
3289 2018-03-23 22:50:36 FYI, nobody's really marching against bump stocks tomorrow.
3290 2018-03-23 22:50:33 Which Congressmen OWN those stocks????
3291 2018-03-23 22:50:24 Bump stocks don't pull the trigger you tremendous buffoon.
3292 2018-03-23 22:50:16 Except do you actually believe that Obama would’ve legalized jump stocks????
3293 2018-03-23 22:50:09 Will be interesting to see how much of that base sticks it out now that their stocks are tanking etc. They were holding out hope but seems like $$ in the pocket is what it comes down to for most.
3294 2018-03-23 22:49:55 Leave it to the Divider-in-Chief to take something as popular as banning bump stocks and turn it into a partisan issue.
3295 2018-03-23 22:49:54 Banning bump stocks not the problem! Until we address the moral down fall of our society and have a place to treat mentally ill people, problems will continue. We have to have a group of investigators to monitor social media & A hot line for people to call with a visit 2verify.
3296 2018-03-23 22:49:48 Why yes? 17 biddies is #Parkland  isn't even close to the record. The record was set with bump stocks.
3297 2018-03-23 22:49:30 Stocks down, Oil up. 
Welcome to 08/09
3298 2018-03-23 22:49:29 Oh Gee thanks, because that's what we were screaming at all those rallies "Ban the bump stocks"!
3299 2018-03-23 22:49:27 Plus, He is now joining the gun control movement and says he will now ban bump stocks.
3300 2018-03-23 22:49:13 R U KIDDING? Who cares? You just voted for another Trillion plus of wasted spending!! AND FUNDED PLANNED PARENTHOOD! Screw your bump stocks bill! What about the babies? MAKE THESE RINO's SEPARATE THE BILL AND VOTE FOR ONE THING AT A TIME! CALL SCHUMER"S BLUFF! HE WON'T VOTE NO!
3301 2018-03-23 22:49:11 I'm confused. I thought Obama was the one who was going to take away everyone's guns away. This seems to be in opposition to someone who would legalize bump stocks.
3302 2018-03-23 22:48:56 Big talk until the @NRA GIVES YOU & the @GOP big campaign donations and then it’s impractical & rushing to conclusions to ban bump stocks.  #ManUp #NRABloodMoney #NRAIsATerroristOrganization #BlueWave2018

3305 2018-03-23 22:48:47 Relatively strong yes, but still tipping over at the 50 day in a falling market. Remember all stocks are ultimately valued on a relative basis to other opportunities, but these look like possible winners for the next bounce.
3306 2018-03-23 22:48:40 STOP LYING. 
STOP LYING. 
DEAR GOD, PLEASE STOP LYING.

Obama did NOT approve bump stocks.  His administration investigated and found that EXISTING laws did not prohibit them. He wanted the laws changed, but GOP Congress blocked him all day, every day, with support from the NRA.
3307 2018-03-23 22:48:33 Banning bump stocks is like banning soft porn. 44,000 Americans die every year from gun violence.
3308 2018-03-23 22:48:31 Your administration have been sitting on your hands for months. Since the mass shooting in Vegas you’ve been making promises about bump stocks. When does the talking stop and the action start?
3309 2018-03-23 22:48:30 Wait, you think bump stocks turn a legal weapon into a machine gun? Please tell me you know thats not how it actually works.
3310 2018-03-23 22:48:14 @wusa9 w 35,000+ high schls in country—130,000 schools—SROs in every school? Why not change gun laws, no-nonsense background checks, get guns away fm prohibited ppl, ban bump stocks, high-capacity magazines, trafficking, etc? NRA you can’t define the 2nd Amdt #marchForOurLives
3311 2018-03-23 22:48:12 Sell their stocks...they are heading over the cliff.
3312 2018-03-23 22:48:09 Nobody cares about bump stocks
3313 2018-03-23 22:48:00 There are not automatic weapons the trigger resets and fires an individual round. That’s is semi automatic @realDonaldTrump you are caving to the liberals those bump stocks did not walk themselves to the shooting, load the weapon and shoot
3314 2018-03-23 22:47:58 alright. i’m good now. water off a duck’s back. i won’t get riled up. i’m all about money now. investments. stocks and bonds. art. i’m too wealthy to fight. i’ll sue a nigga if he duff my shit
3315 2018-03-23 22:47:56 "This is a lie. 

The Obama administration didn't legalize bump stocks. 

Obama issued EOs creating stricter controls (all of which Trump has rolled back), but could not legally restrict (non mechanical) bump stocks without new laws. Congress refused." Via @Stonekettle
3316 2018-03-23 22:47:56 The penny stocks type stuff
3317 2018-03-23 22:47:40 If it walks like a dictator, talks like a dictator & acts like a dictator...

Trump is not a POTUS.
Trump does not want to be POTUS.
Trump sanctions are to manipulate stocks.
Trump wants omnipotence.
Trump wants family rule.
Trump will start wars for profit.
Trump is playing us.
3318 2018-03-23 22:47:38 Aw fuck washing myself*. Laughing Stocks great tho
3319 2018-03-23 22:47:38 Is that the best spin you can come up with on bump stocks?  Because you’ve just portrayed Obama as pro gun, pro 2nd Amendment pro NRA! Haha!
3320 2018-03-23 22:47:37 @TheJusticeDept bump stocks? Why don't you repeal parts of first amendment that you find offensive. No turning back, even for your own rights that will be outlawed.
3321 2018-03-23 22:47:29 You lie so easily. The ATF approved applications from a pair of manufacturers to make bump stocks because they were not against the law and congress wouldn’t ban them. Try what you will, nothing you do will save you from the upcoming #Stormy #TrumpRussiaColusion #60Minutes
3322 2018-03-23 22:47:08 Bolton, Budget and Bump Stocks.

Trump spitting on his base.
3323 2018-03-23 22:47:04 Obama did not approve Bump Stocks.  His administration simply found that the current LAWS did not prohibit them.  Obama was not able to make a new law because Congress wouldn't allow it.
3324 2018-03-23 22:47:02 It's March, Vegas shooting happened 6 months ago and u are finally banning bump stocks.  Congrats. The funding for DACA and the wall should not b on the same bill. U forced DACA. The wall will b a huge waste of money.
3325 2018-03-23 22:46:52 ATF, a bureau within the executive branch, decided it could not regulate bump stocks during the Obama administration. This allowed 2 companies to sell bump stocks. Obama called for more regulation of guns, he never approved them personally
3326 2018-03-23 22:46:31 Good luck with that. Plus your a liar
 So no one believes you. And Obama didn't approve bump stocks. He did pass more  Anti gun legislation that you have since overturned
3327 2018-03-23 22:46:29 Oh yeah, well I can make an easy alternative myself.  Bump stocks aren't the problem.  

#showvote
3328 2018-03-23 22:46:17 That’s stretching it, since the laws prevented Obama and the ATF from being able to regulating bump stocks.

Now, who’s the idiot that reversed Obama’s order that prevented the mentally ill (i.e. Nicholas Cruz) from purchasing weapons? Hint: he’s orange with the initials DJT.
3329 2018-03-23 22:46:10 Liberals aren't rejoicing but are grateful for any real restriction in the possession, manufacturing, & selling of bump stocks to the public.  I think review the wording used to "ban" bump stocks to assure there is no "loophole" for similar devices will bring more gratitude too.
3330 2018-03-23 22:46:02 Bump stocks do not make guns fire faster. This is ridiculous. I am watching the President I chose turn against his base. 2020 I will vote for the other republican. Very sad.
3331 2018-03-23 22:45:54 Why don't you @realDonaldTrump reverse the current ATF policy for bump stocks. People research Former President Obama and bump stocks..
3332 2018-03-23 22:45:51 Thing is, the proposed legislation does not specify bump stocks.  The language is vague and could be interpreted loosely. Thus, anything that increases fire rate could be banned. Bolt action rifles, revolvers with quick change barrels, etc. It needs to be reworded.

3335 2018-03-23 22:45:35 What about the other promises you made after the Florida shooting. Banning bump stocks may placate some...definitely not all
3336 2018-03-23 22:45:24 You’re right- but it’s not merely about their business or bump stocks. Rule making procedures can’t amend laws- and that’s what this is an effort to do; and why it ultimately won’t fly. The only way to ban this is legislation.
3337 2018-03-23 22:45:17 I didn’t see that but his initial tweet was somewhat sensationalist & misleading. The point could have been made in a more constructive & balanced way (“plunges!!”) I simply agree with @Paul_Stocks_IFA original tweet on the subject
3338 2018-03-23 22:45:11 O'Bama admin didn't "Legalize" Bump Stocks. It was a loophole in existing laws. There was NO ONE that "LEGALIZED" them!!
3339 2018-03-23 22:45:06 Every time the stock market has declined, it eventually has more than fully recovered. Hedging the stock market by shorting stocks, or by buying puts on the S&P 500 Index, or any other method usually is expensive, and, in the long run, is a waste of money. -- Ed Wachenheim
3340 2018-03-23 22:45:00 I’m not sure you get bump stocks, then. Leave it be, please.
3341 2018-03-23 22:44:53 No the chap talking about bump stocks.
3342 2018-03-23 22:44:46 Obama did not legalize bump stocks like you tweeted.
The law did not allow Obama to prohibit bump stocks.  
If congress wanted to regulate them they could have, but didn’t.

3345 2018-03-23 22:44:32 Exactly.  We hired a fighter and we got a sleepy old man chasing DACA fix, bump stocks, opiods and MS-13.  Not huge priorities.
3346 2018-03-23 22:44:25 You do know how stocks work right ?? How much did you MAKE IN THE LAST YEAR? You Left that part out .....
3347 2018-03-23 22:44:18 鮭でいい？
3348 2018-03-23 22:44:12 The tape is very traceable especially with the expansion of ranges we see on daily basis . Just have to have patience as stocks are confirming on both sides of ledger . Only concern sometimes is liquidity. As mkt goes down less market participants
3349 2018-03-23 22:44:03 .@jeffsessions Just banning bump stocks is not enough. Ban assault weapons & high capacity magazines for civilians, red flag warnings and centralized database needs to be added. We don't want to ban all guns, so it's not a 2nd amendment issue.
#MarchForOurLives
3350 2018-03-23 22:44:01 Lying as usual.  The Obama administration determined that existing law did not permit the regulation of bump stocks.  Even your tweet acknowledges that a rule making is needed to ban bump stocks. Since the NRA won’t oppose a ban NOW, the rule will probably succeed.
3351 2018-03-23 22:43:57 Nobody gives a shit about bump stocks! You know what they do give a shit about? Spending into oblivion. You just ensured your own impeachment, and I’m not going to lose sleep over it.
3352 2018-03-23 22:43:51 The Las Vegas shooter had AR-15’s and AK’s with bump stocks, combined with a 100 round drum filled with 7.62’s @ .223’s...   made for a very messy day.
3353 2018-03-23 22:43:44 Inbox: U.S. AG Jeff Sessions has proposed a regulation clarifying that bump stocks are banned because they fall within definition of “machine gun” under federal law. #GunControl #orpol
3354 2018-03-23 22:43:41 @JohnCornyn banning bump stocks is putting lipstick on an ugly pig. Let's harden our schools, do away with gun free zones, sterner back ground checks, hold accountable the law enforcement agencies personnel  that fail to follow leads that would have prevented this past shooting.
3355 2018-03-23 22:43:34 Well if you and Congress think we going to throw away any bump stocks we own.... Yeah not happeneing!!  This is a away to unarm America!!

3357 2018-03-23 22:43:30 THIS IS A LIE. #LiarTrump

The Obama administration didn't legalize bump stocks.
3358 2018-03-23 22:43:26 In 2010 the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives determined that because bump stocks don't have any moving parts, they are a "firearm part" could not be regulated as a firearm under existing gun laws. The ATF reached a similar conclusion in 2012.  TELL THE TRUTH!
3359 2018-03-23 22:43:18 True, nearly all but industrial stocks suffered this week (for different reasons). It is a good product overall...a bit more focus on security and it will do well. I know that I enjoy using @Dropbox
3360 2018-03-23 22:43:13 Bump stocks have no military or police use. No civilian use either.
3361 2018-03-23 22:43:12 Bump stocks themselves aren’t the problem, but they serve no purpose so should he gone. Evil and irresponsible people ruin many privileges....., not that bump stocks could be considered a privilege.
3362 2018-03-23 22:43:11 He's not banning Guns, it's bump stocks who really needs bumps stocks?
3363 2018-03-23 22:43:07 Did the Obama administration actively legalise the sale of bump stocks or was it that at that time there was no legal way by which they could prohibit the sale of bump stocks. There is a difference.
3364 2018-03-23 22:42:59 This is a weak-minded position on so many levels. Bump stocks don’t create machine guns and even if they did the problem isn’t the item or method used to cause havoc; it is the perpetrator!

3366 2018-03-23 22:42:45 Ask congress why it’s okay for them to trade stocks on insider info. Ask them how they got so damn rich serving the public. How many IOU have these people written to their donors? How do they fulfill them? With bills like the omnibus.
3367 2018-03-23 22:42:42 As a supporter of the Second amendment I fully support the Justice Department's rules change that effectively bans the use of "bump stocks" which turn semi-automatic weapons into fully automatic weapons (which are illegal).
3368 2018-03-23 22:42:25 As soon as you (illegally) hold this stuff there's a chance it can get out FFS & May specifically said the only way this stuff could get into UK was:
1. Russian involvement 
2. Russia losing control of its stocks.
She forgot to add:
3. UK hold stocks of it!!!
3369 2018-03-23 22:42:24 The problem is much of MAGA's base, doesn't have stock, this doesn't affect them (though they can never again use the "stocks" as an arguing point).
3370 2018-03-23 22:42:21 老師どこにいるの？
3371 2018-03-23 22:42:17 Given that the ATF didn't enforce the law as it pertains to bump stocks under Obama, the fact that the AG under a different administration that the ATF rolls up to is announcing it makes the headline more meaningful than you allege
3372 2018-03-23 22:42:17 Wrong, Mr Bonespur Dennison!  Again!    Ban bump stocks, but re-enstate the mental health clause that Obama had in place and YOU took away!  BTW Parkland happened over a month ago, and you've not backed a single word you gave those kids!  You are a liar! #notonemore#stopthelies#
3373 2018-03-23 22:42:13 Its saying that the nra immediately stated that they should reconsider the approval of bump stocks and there regulation. Its also saying obama admi . Could have not approved
3374 2018-03-23 22:41:43 You don't need an assault rifle, bump stocks or high capacity magazines to hunt. A waiting period and a real background check won't interfere with law abiding citizens hunting.  Gun control now! We can't allow another massacre

3377 2018-03-23 22:41:25 Input from Scottish firearm license holders. Great news about the bump stocks. I’m limited to 150 rounds. Guns don’t kill people; bullets kill people. Introducing effective control on ammo sale, limiting quantity of ammo for purpose would be a start. Starve the supply!
3378 2018-03-23 22:41:15 Obama administration did not legalize bump stocks. WTF is wrong with you?
3379 2018-03-23 22:41:08 Really?  After signing monstrous Omnibus Bill into law which fed every Dem dream you’re concern is with bump stocks?  A belt loop can have the same effect!  Voter 4U, but you are steadily losing me
3380 2018-03-23 22:41:03 I just saw them list them once in a tv interview. I don’t know them all. I THINK.... 1) create universal background checks 2) ban bump stocks, 3) I think was a ban on military type assault rifles....don’t know others.
3381 2018-03-23 22:41:01 Buy more, when stocks go down you get more for your money, as long as you dont sell, you've lost nothing.  Stocks always long term.
3382 2018-03-23 22:40:56 Bump stocks were legalized for handicapped people not average shooters
3383 2018-03-23 22:40:54 Sessions moves to criminalize possession of bump stocks
3384 2018-03-23 22:40:49 Look I don't know if you are catching me on a bad day or not but you are becoming tiresome. Banning bump stocks isn't gun control and it isn't a slippery slop. It's banning bump stocks. I get you hate Trump I'm just not going to put up with stupid  crap today.
3385 2018-03-23 22:40:47 No money for the wall and illegals kill more Americans a year than the one incident with bump stocks.
3386 2018-03-23 22:40:40 Liar. The Obama admin didn't legalize bump stocks.
3387 2018-03-23 22:40:26 While waiting on the decision for bump stocks, I assume gun owners know, the ban on assault weapons was ruled constitutional and permissible under the 2nd Amendment.  The NRA has tried, but no Federal Appeals Court has ever ruled assault weapons were protected by the 2nd Amend.
3388 2018-03-23 22:40:23 Or Ripple at 2$ .. ROFL .. Nah but as a sentiment check they are the best ... after the French election they went crazy bullish euro stocks .. nobody wins at #tradewars
3389 2018-03-23 22:40:21 So, following @realDonaldTrump 's logic, the gun nuts against banning their beloved bump stocks should thank Obama? #Upsidedown #thanksobama
3390 2018-03-23 22:40:14 Enjoying those tariffs and falling stocks? So much winning!

3393 2018-03-23 22:40:12 Now, if we can only ban the Trump stocks turning out dumb tweets non-stop...
3394 2018-03-23 22:40:11 Obama didn't legalize bump stocks, the DOJ can't legally ban them, and a bump stock doesn't turn a gun into a machine gun.  Every part of that tweet is wrong.
3395 2018-03-23 22:40:10 They (GOP) are only giving up bump stocks since they don’t care about them, not that much demand for them. But try to get rid of civilian M-16, er, AR-15s and the NRA gun manufacturers will cry out.
3396 2018-03-23 22:40:09 a bureau within the executive branch, could not regulate bump stocks during the Obama admin.
These decisions allowed two companies to sell bump stocks.  this was not a statement of Obama’s preferred policy, which called for more regulation of guns. So NO he didn't legalize them.
3397 2018-03-23 22:40:01 E stocks, or collapsible to under 32”...it would save many lives. The reverse, save 160, kill 3,000 more by encouraging pistols? It’s nonsensical. I DO agree with gun regulation and restrictions however the rifle (semi auto 20-30rds), DID exist in 1779. And was given to civilians
3398 2018-03-23 22:39:56 I heard Obama actually invented bump stocks. He not only marketed them as a great toy for children, he mandated they be given to every citizen of the United States. I personally have zero firearms, but I own 37 bump stocks. THANKS OBAMA!
3399 2018-03-23 22:39:53 The language is too broad, it's not just bump stocks. It's rate increasing devices. Even something like a match trigger is now a no-no in Fla. Slippery slope...

3404 2018-03-23 22:39:27 You can't seem to find enough things to blame on Obama. But bump stocks ? Give me a break.
3405 2018-03-23 22:39:11 Also I like how your jumping on ban wagon against Obama he didn't ban bump stocks. Give it time Trump Mauna you will be at the receiving end of bump stocks
3406 2018-03-23 22:38:55 Bump stocks havent killed anyone criminals have. Criminals are the problem not stocks and not guns.
3407 2018-03-23 22:38:47 HE'S LYING AGAIN. 
There was no legislation prohibiting bump stocks. They were looked into and found to be legal because there was nothing in place to regulate them. They fell through the legal cracks. He did not legalize them. They were found legal under current laws.
3408 2018-03-23 22:38:47 Are you shorting stocks? Whenever you open your holy mouth, stock market crushes! Still looking for White House staff who calls you “daddy”? You are a FAKE president and you know that... @realDonaldTrump
3409 2018-03-23 22:38:34 Who cares about bump stocks. You did not need to sign the 1.3 billion bill to fund military. Just your excuse. You can forget 2020 re-election.

3412 2018-03-23 22:38:17 Where is the proof that Obama legalized bump stocks? Talking out of your ass again?
3413 2018-03-23 22:38:12 Stocks tank...thank you, @realDonaldTrump
3414 2018-03-23 22:38:10 Nobody gives a shit. Name all the school shootings that featured bump stocks.
3415 2018-03-23 22:38:10 Get over losing an hours sleep this weekend!!!! Cask ales only £2:50 a pint while stocks last !!!!!! Try a Greenking IPA or our own Jubilee “miners shaft” for only £2:50 !!!! Another great reason to visit your local 
3416 2018-03-23 22:38:10 Bump stocks weren't made illegal by the most gun hating president in history because bump stocks do not turn guns into machine guns. And I saw a few pictures of that las vegas room and didn't see one single bump stock.
3417 2018-03-23 22:37:39 That’s a complete lie!! Obama never approved bump stocks!!
3418 2018-03-23 22:37:36 Was excellent reception by public markets in a very rough week for tech stocks. Investors will love the predictability of the business and upside potential long term.
3419 2018-03-23 22:37:34 Do some research regarding Gun Control Act John Spencer & bump stocks before tweeting.
3420 2018-03-23 22:37:29 Thank you again president Trump for your great leadership and cleaning up Obama's mess bump stocks was a bad idea thank you for straightening that out you're awesome sir
3421 2018-03-23 22:37:26 By announcing that the DOJ is implementing a ban on Bump Stocks will cause a rush to purchase. The DOJ should implement a ban on sales effective immediately then institute the ban. @TheJusticeDept
3422 2018-03-23 22:37:18 According to the NRA, Obama did everything possible to LIMIT gun rights. How does Obama LEGALIZING bump stocks fit in to the NRA narrative of he was bad for gun rights? Something about your tweet just doesn't seem right. But then again, none of your tweets ever seem right.
3423 2018-03-23 22:37:11 Love you and your bands,and I agree with you about gun control. However as a gun owner who enjoys shooting,including guns with the dreaded bump stocks, we have to find a balance. The 2nd amendment is one of the great fail safes of our founding fathers!
3424 2018-03-23 22:37:08 FORGET about the fricken bump stocks.....WE WANT A WALL!  Illegals stole my identity & tax return two years ago, illegals are taking jobs & committing crimes...INCLUDING MURDER.   Enough with illegal immigrants!
3425 2018-03-23 22:37:02 Interesting. Obama’s ATF determined that bump stocks couldn’t be regulated under then-current law. At the time, the republican Congress would not address gun regulation on any terms. Yet, it was Obama’s fault?  Do you take all NRA BS, without question? Idiot.
3426 2018-03-23 22:37:01 and today he is bragging about banning bump stocks w/out Cong., and about the new tough background checks he wants.  I bet if a liberal seat comes open on the Courts, he will back dwn from that fight also.
3427 2018-03-23 22:37:00 That’s not a proper STOCK MARKET report what about STOCKS, STOCKS, STOCKS - winning, winning, winning! 
3428 2018-03-23 22:36:51 Except when those “law abiding Americans” use those bump stocks on guns to kill 59 people at a concert. 
3429 2018-03-23 22:36:25 Banned bump stocks.
3430 2018-03-23 22:36:23 Banning bump stocks is the equivalent of throwing a cup of water on forest fire. Your word is as worthless as the paper it’s written on. You are a puppet of the NRA and Putin.
3431 2018-03-23 22:36:21 Ban bump stocks  = Republicans " No retarded democrats Stocks dont kill people " . 
Trump says "ban Bump Stocks " 
Repulicans "Yah great President We worship anything you say "  Damn  TRUMPTARDS
3432 2018-03-23 22:36:08 That is a blatant lie. Obama never "legalized" bump stocks.  And, you've had since October 1, 2017 with absolutely no action on bump stocks.  You are a fraud and a failure.
3433 2018-03-23 22:36:01 And a total of 5-6 Million members right? 300+ million non-members. I think public opinion is shifting on NRA. Even trump said ban bump stocks.
3434 2018-03-23 22:35:47 What is the matter with you. Obama had nothing to do with bump stocks. Ban assault weapons. Simple.
3435 2018-03-23 22:35:45 Oh Jacob, Jacob, Jacob. . . We are tired of sacrificing our children on the altar of the 2nd amendment just so you and your buddies can own weapons capable of killing many people in a VERY short period of time. Bump stocks are the beginning.
3436 2018-03-23 22:35:36 @realDonaldTrump stocks are crashing. Will you take credit for this?  Your words of tariffs and trade wars have caused this plummet.
3437 2018-03-23 22:35:34 Is It hard to say: We are bantning bump stocks! And leave out the Obama bashing. It’s just petty and frankly childish.
3438 2018-03-23 22:35:27 TRUMP just banned gun bump stocks
3439 2018-03-23 22:35:24 My eyes are open to Trump now that he used the DOJ to ban bump stocks based upon the Florida False Flag shooting. One must ask the question: whose side is Trump on? Is he on the side of good?  Yes one must ask these questions.
3440 2018-03-23 22:35:20 Nope, sorry.  Obama administration tried to regulate bump stocks but couldn't. Bump stocks were considered a gun component, not an actual firearm. Nice try blaming President Obama, but, as usual, not correct. So SAD.
3441 2018-03-23 22:35:05 Bump stocks aren’t even the problem. You caved to the NRA on age requirements and on banning assault weapons! You are complicit and blood is on your hands!
3442 2018-03-23 22:35:00 Bump stocks harness a weapon’s recoil to cause the user’s finger to squeeze the trigger repeatedly, but because they don’t alter the gun’s internal mechanisms, they were considered lawful. However Obama did place other laws in place which are being rolled back.
3443 2018-03-23 22:34:53 You did not veto the omnibus. So much for your promises. Bump stocks cannot compare with funding of planned parenthood, sanctuary cities, and limited wall funding. Your word is worthless. Try being quiet for awhile. You cannot recuperate from this.
3444 2018-03-23 22:34:43 You are blaming Obama for bump stocks, really? Unbelievable the low road you take time and time again
3445 2018-03-23 22:34:34 Trump is right on this one. Obama determined that the DOJ would not regulate gun parts. That's what bump stocks were classified as.
3446 2018-03-23 22:34:33 Not true. Under the law at that time, bump stocks did not fall into the category that would allow them to be banned. You can get this info on google. Do your homework and lead with facts
3447 2018-03-23 22:34:30 No he didn't!

Obama issued EOs creating stricter controls (all of which your dumb ass rolled back), but could not legally restrict (non-mechanical) bump stocks without new laws. Congress said no.
3448 2018-03-23 22:34:28 Mr. President bump stocks are a gimmick. We don't care about bump stocks.
We care about our second amendment.
3449 2018-03-23 22:34:22 Needs to plumb another 2oo billion at least the FB stocks.
3450 2018-03-23 22:34:22 He almost immediately followed up with a comment that it wasn't about return. He merely stated facts.
3451 2018-03-23 22:34:20 Definitely not arguing possibility this could be challenged. Bump stocks alone are a million$$ business

3466 2018-03-23 22:32:27 Obama didn't legalize bump stocks. They fall within the standard for 1 shot with 1 trigger pull. I would think a smart president would know that just like a smart president wouldn't have signed the POS Omnibus bill
3467 2018-03-23 22:32:25 Now that your time in office is actually affecting stocks @realDonaldTrump , you’ve lost your voice for it

3470 2018-03-23 22:32:01 The deep state won a big one today and probably ensured a "blue wave" in November. Still love Trump but he made two epic mistakes today that will damage his unique relationship w/ his base.

Should have vetoed that monstrosity and left "bump stocks" to congress.
3471 2018-03-23 22:31:51 1)Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced on Friday a proposed rule criminalizing possession of bump stocks, which can make a semi-automatic weapon fire at the rate of an automatic weapon.
3472 2018-03-23 22:31:29 If you graduated college you should be able to do your taxes. Most of y’all ain’t trading stocks or itemizing anyway
3473 2018-03-23 22:31:15 Instead of focusing on every chance you get to spin a half-truth into yet another reason for overt, subconscious, and closeted racists to decry Obama, why not just focus on making progress?Obama didn't personally approve bump stocks. He had no authority to ban them.
3474 2018-03-23 22:31:12 So the GOP blocked bump stocks from being repealed but couldn't block Obamacare that's just weak as an excuse
3475 2018-03-23 22:31:03 I don't care about bump stocks, but I do care about the second amendment. Trump lost a lot of trust today.
3476 2018-03-23 22:31:02 Obama Administration did NOT "legalize" bump stocks. Another pathetic lie from the #LiarInChief
3477 2018-03-23 22:31:00 The Obama administration didn't legalize bump stocks...They were never illegal in the first place.
They were never illegal because (contrary to what you seem to think) they DO NOT turn a semi-auto into a "machine gun".
3478 2018-03-23 22:31:00 Trump; forget "bump stocks"; if you we're really pro-second amendment, you would push for repealing the National Firearms Act of 1934.

3480 2018-03-23 22:30:51 Yes it is, but if this makes Trump ban bump stocks as part of his undo everything Obama agenda, then for once Trump did the right thing.

We should also thank the person that told Trump this lie.
3481 2018-03-23 22:30:41 agree  fun fact DAX trades at April 2017 levels .. Next target 11600 and Deutsche Bank touched new 52 week low today .. But yeah buy European stocks was all the CNBC rage in 2017 ..
3482 2018-03-23 22:30:35 You know he is lying right? You know Obama didn’t approve the sell of bump stocks right? Tell me you aren’t that stupid.
3483 2018-03-23 22:30:14 Really Republicans banned bump stocks but couldn't ban Obamacare sounds fishy to me
3484 2018-03-23 22:30:08 Bump stocks just ruin rifles anyway
3485 2018-03-23 22:30:01 I still support you, Mr. President, but you promised to #BuildTheWall - will you keep that promise? Bump stocks are irrelevant.
3486 2018-03-23 22:29:49 Banning bump stocks is stupidity at it's finest. Last I checked methamphetamine was banned. Still everywhere. Im starting to think the only way to have sense in Washington is to Burn the swamp. The whole damn thing.
3487 2018-03-23 22:29:46 Does any reslize we have s lying sak o shit for prez. Obama l never legalized bump stocks .as far as kickin Trumps fat ass on tbe WH lswn .l'm up for it.

3488 2018-03-23 22:29:41 The Obama administration didn't "legalize" bump stocks - they were already being sold. The Obama-era ATF decided in 2010 that bump stocks did not come under their regulatory authority. The Trump-era ATF said the same thing in 2017.
3489 2018-03-23 22:29:38 As long as there are evil people, bump stocks, at a minimum, need to be banned.
3490 2018-03-23 22:29:35 It is categorically UNTRUE that the Obama’s Administration “legalized bump stocks.”

The FACT is that the Republican Congress during his tenure wouldn’t pass a law making them illegal.

Truth matters, Donnie. Get you some.
3491 2018-03-23 22:29:33 OBAMA DID NOT LEGSLIZE BUMP STOCKS. AS USUAL YOU TWIST EVERYTHING. THE ATF HAS TO RE-EVALUATE THE WORDING IN TJE FIREARMS ACT TO EFFECT THE REGULATION. OBAMA HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. BUT YOU CANT STOP TRYING TO TEAR APART THE BLACK MAN. LIES. NOTHING BUT LIES.
3492 2018-03-23 22:29:29 Obama Administration "blah blah blah"  Not true, they did not legalize Bump stocks.  If your DOJ truly issues a rule banning bump stocks, that will be awesome.  Unfortunately, since you lie so much, I doubt you mean this.
3493 2018-03-23 22:29:25 Hahaha having a deficit doesn't mean their investments doesn't made profit. Ya know expenses are essential in business. Investments of stocks will nit be paid in just months. There is a giben payback period. And SM has profit see their EBIT.
3494 2018-03-23 22:29:07 Bump stocks DO NOT turn a gun from semi automatic into full auto. Whoever told you this should be met with the 2 words you’re famous for..  “You’re fired”
3495 2018-03-23 22:29:06 Bump stocks don’t solve the problem though. As a very strong 2A supporter I’ll say they are unnecessary, but banning them does practically nothing. We need solutions that don’t infringe rights for law abiding citizens while keeping fire arms from violent convicts and mentally ill
3496 2018-03-23 22:28:57 Another lie. Obama did not legalize bump stocks.
3497 2018-03-23 22:28:56 @realDonaldTrump what the f's the matter with you? Bump stocks? Now THAT'S our biggest threat, yes sir... Trying to earn points with people that hate you? Even smarter. I hope it was worth it signing away the wall for a fn FENCE! BIG MISTAKE!!!!!
3498 2018-03-23 22:28:14 Bump stocks are red herring if you know how to do it you can get the same effect without a bump stock what nobody's talking about are called binary triggers
3499 2018-03-23 22:28:14 So the guy that all of the #MAGA folks thought was going to take away their guns made it possible for bump stocks to be legalized? That means either the #MAGATrash are idiots or Donnie is lying. Hard choice here.
3500 2018-03-23 22:28:06 @USAGSessions looking for feedback on bump stocks? Auto weapons are illegal. Anything that converts a firearm to auto should be illegal. But semi-autos should be legal, including AR-15s. I am an NRA member.
3501 2018-03-23 22:28:06 No YOUR complacency with the Deep State is THE BAD IDEA. Bump Stocks are not a problem. did the Austin Bomber use BUMP STOCKS - right, I didn't think so. Planned Parenthood kills MORE People than any other cause -  yet you signed a bill fully funding murder of human infants.
3502 2018-03-23 22:28:04 Obama did NOT LEGALIZE BUMP STOCKS! We’re you born an idiot or did you gradually acquire the skill?
3503 2018-03-23 22:27:55 Yeah, between this and the bump stocks I feel a bit queasy.
3504 2018-03-23 22:27:44 Obama didn’t legalize bump stocks. It’s a gun part not firearm therefore not subject to fed regulation.What O did do was sign many executed orders for stricter gun laws that Trump has systematically rolled back. Trump’s b.stock ban is weak vs real legislation that the NRA apposes
3505 2018-03-23 22:27:38 This is a lie. Obama did not legalize bump stocks. What you’re trying to do is potentially illegal. Congress has to legislate it.
3506 2018-03-23 22:27:37 The Obama administration didn't "legalize" bump stocks - they were already being sold. The Obama-era ATF decided in 2010 that bump stocks did not come under their regulatory authority. The Trump-era ATF said the same thing in 2017.
3507 2018-03-23 22:27:36 I agree. A few strategic trades by left wing big investors. My oil stocks are up 10%
3508 2018-03-23 22:27:34 Who makes this shit up for you. Obama did not legalize bump stocks. Obama wanted to make the expired ban permanent the @GOP and @NRA fought every attempt to reimplement it. Remember him pleading with tears flowing for gun control after Sandy Hook?
3509 2018-03-23 22:27:30 @realDonaldTrump .   Obama could have outlawed bump stocks during his presidency, but he didn't. Who really cares about America?

3510 2018-03-23 22:27:29 Wrong. Obama did NOT legalize bump stocks. Do your research!!
3511 2018-03-23 22:27:26 To be honest, seeing posts like this is depressing coz there’s never enough stocks for all the fans
3512 2018-03-23 22:27:26 The Obama administration didn't legalize bump stocks. The ATF under Obama determined that bump stocks didn't come under its regulatory authority. Your ATF came to the same conclusion in 2017. After claiming O was out to destroy the 2nd Amendment, now you're saying he was pro-gun?
3513 2018-03-23 22:27:25 @BobFredericks Your @nypost story on the latest Trump tweet says @PolitiFact rated the claim that the Obama Administration "legalized" bump stocks "mostly true." But their rating applies to the claim that the Obama Administration "approved the sale" of bump stocks. Different!
3514 2018-03-23 22:27:21 Obama Administration did not legalize bump stocks, you NRA mouthpiece.
3515 2018-03-23 22:27:20 Don't twist the facts.  During the Obama administration, the ATF, a bureau within the executive branch, decided it could not regulate bump stocks under the current law.  Obama's preference was to have more regulation on guns. @realDonaldTrump
3516 2018-03-23 22:27:12 Bump stocks? Really? You just signed a disaster of a spending bill and you're discussing bump stocks. You gave the democrats everything budget wise, are bump stocks the frosting?
3517 2018-03-23 22:27:02 Bump Stocks is "NOT" Considered Firearms, it a sellable part, Obama ATF couldn't have stopped the Sales. Don't Fall under the National firearm Act.Needs a full Legislation Policy/Majority Leader Ryan said:They would look at that!He did not say they would take up that Legislation!
3518 2018-03-23 22:26:53 Bump stocks are gone for no reason
We still have illegals Fn our country's hospitality blind
N rogue intel agencies running amok inside our own country
Our enemies get everything they wanted, funded
And babies are still ritualistically killed by the millions

This isnt "winning"
3519 2018-03-23 22:26:50 Fr: E. Krassenstein: NO! Obama DID NOT legalize bump stocks like DT just Tweeted.  The law simply did not allow Obama to prohibit bump stocks.  If congress wanted to regulate them they could have. Pres.Trump is WRONG! Bump stocks weren't  an issue until after the Vegas shootings.
3520 2018-03-23 22:26:35 Trump doesn’t control the stock market. Institutional investors control prices of stocks. You can make money when the market goes down too. You do know that, right?
3521 2018-03-23 22:26:29 I can't find it on you although the rest, yes. They bust up the stocks, sell out, drop it, buy it low, raise it again, sell out, drop it, and do it again for their billions. I'm very proud of you President Trump. Thanks.
3522 2018-03-23 22:26:21 While bump stocks will definitely be banned in the US at some point, please know this...

Bump-n'-Grindstock, my yearly 90's slow jams festival, will be goin' DOWN this summer NO MATTER WHAT.
3523 2018-03-23 22:26:07 Do you remember when Trump promised to ban bump stocks, raise the legal age to buy firearms, and implement universal background checks? It was 3 weeks ago and his position changed 4X since then. He’s a man of his word, that president of yours.
3524 2018-03-23 22:25:49 NO!  Obama DID NOT legalize bump stocks like Trump just Tweeted.  The law simply did not allow Obama to prohibit bump stocks.  If congress wanted to regulate them they could have.  President Trump is WRONG! Bump stocks weren't considered an issue until after the Vegas shootings.
3525 2018-03-23 22:25:33 who cares about bump stocks? you signed one of the worst pieces of legislation in american history. that bill will cause damage all over the world.
3526 2018-03-23 22:25:32 Banning bumb stocks is like banning more than 10 round mags or detachable mags. The argument is the same, "Who needs them?"  We continue to give into the anti-gun left and it won't stop with just banning bump stocks.  We in CA understand this.
3527 2018-03-23 22:25:26 ...and ATF under Obama only allowed bump stocks because it was illegal to prohibit them at the time.
3528 2018-03-23 22:25:17 Bump stocks are not what will bring America down!
3529 2018-03-23 22:25:15 Bump stocks don't kill people.  Unfettered immigration and open borders kills a people.
3530 2018-03-23 22:25:15 Yeah, I'm curious if the federal government is gonna have to buy up a huge stockpile of bump stocks to implement this. Also, don't think I've seen any mention of (functionally similar) crank-fire systems being included in the proposed rule?
3531 2018-03-23 22:25:09 We voted for Trump??? A ban on bump stocks is actually a ban on rate of fire, all magazines, multi shot pistols and rifles bad deal for 2A.
3532 2018-03-23 22:25:03 Me.President can you piss off more of your supporters than you did today? First that 1.3 trillion monstrosity now bump stocks. Say goodbye to 2020 probably 2018 also. If you’re going to keep the faithful you had better show us something soon!
3533 2018-03-23 22:24:45 Trump is, as usual, LYING to you. Obama did not legalize bump stocks. And America, the only reason Trump is banning bump stocks is because the NRA doesn’t profit from them. Look it up.
3534 2018-03-23 22:24:42 Okay cool, then bump stocks should be irrelevant to you and therefore give you no reason to call someone worthless over a difference of opinion.

3537 2018-03-23 22:24:35 Have you done any research on Bump Stocks? Banning them changes nothing, they don;t turn any gun into a automatic machine gun. You git played and played good.
3538 2018-03-23 22:24:25 This week:
1. Stock market Crash             2. Gun Control (Bump Stocks)
3. the Bill you just signed.
#WhyHaveYouForesakenUs #HorribleWeek #NRA
3539 2018-03-23 22:24:16 If @realDonaldTrump does something to help ban bump stocks, great. Still doesn't change the fact that he's unfit for office, a traitor, and needs to be put off office.
3540 2018-03-23 22:24:14 BOOOOO

Personal freedoms should be OUR CHOICE
#BumpStocks have NOT been a NATIONAL SAFETY ISSUE

But I suppose banning bump stocks will stop our rogue intel agencies from eliciting shootings+bombings+Amtrak/plane crashes, etc.

Oh wait.. no
It's just another freedom stolen
3541 2018-03-23 22:24:12 Were bump stocks ever used in the BS shootings ?
3542 2018-03-23 22:24:11 Ramen stocks would be a great hedge
3543 2018-03-23 22:24:10 DOJ proposes a ban on bump stocks just a day before the nationwide gun control marches take place, tomorrow.
3544 2018-03-23 22:24:03 #Stocks $TSX $APH $ACB $AMZN $RY Never forget, the game is RIGGED.  $APH just proved how illegal and shady they are, insiders should be headed to jail.  Where's the regulators? $NUU  Will be calling investor relations, MP, TSX on Monday.
3545 2018-03-23 22:24:02 THAT....is called justice and Karma. Same with Facebook and Twitter stocks plummeting and all their woes, totally deserved and God working in mysteriously beautiful ways.
3546 2018-03-23 22:23:58 Donald Trump:
Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.
3547 2018-03-23 22:23:53 Obama administration did NOT legalize bump stocks. Why don't you check facts once in a while.
3548 2018-03-23 22:23:45 The issue isn't bumb stocks.  The issue is the continued encroachment on the legal rights of gun owners. Asking, "who needs bump stocks?' is like asking, "Who needs more than 10 round mags or a detachable mag?" The issue is giving into the liberal agenda of more gun control.
3549 2018-03-23 22:23:44 Well that's another lie bad idea. If I were you I wouldn't start out with a lie.... And I will not believe ban on bump stocks either till I see it. So will be waiting to see.
3550 2018-03-23 22:23:40 MRP es un sistema de planificación de la producción y de gestión de stocks que responden las siguientes preguntas, ¿que? ¿cuanto? Y ¿cuando? Se debe de fabricar y aprovisionar @Monsivais0884 69
3551 2018-03-23 22:23:36 You make it sound like Obama personally authorized bump stocks. That is not the case. So it is good that you are bending them and maybe we could do other sensible gun control too. Oh wait I forgot it's you and you very seldom do anything that's sensible.
3552 2018-03-23 22:23:33 But bumb stocks saved lives in the shooting than they killed. If the shooter had a controlled rate of fire, there would have been many more dead and injured.
3553 2018-03-23 22:23:25 Bump Stocks were NOT legalized under President Obama. Why do you LIE all the time
3554 2018-03-23 22:23:15 How many are affected by bump stocks?
How many millions affected by illegal immigration?
I’m done for the night going to drown my sorrows and have a big steak. Hopefully I die of a coronary b4 I see this great country turn into France w/ 1000’s of tanks
3555 2018-03-23 22:23:15 "Bump stocks weren't considered an issue until after the Vegas shootings." #TheGreyResistance has to ask.Why wasn't an "accessory" that converted an AR-15 into an M-16 not even considered an issue?What the actual F***!!!!
Asking for those massacred by bump stock equipped AR-15's
3556 2018-03-23 22:23:12 Shows how stupid you really are. Bump stocks Do Not turn AR's into machine guns. The trigger still has to be depressed for each shot. You can do the same thing with your belt loop. #LiarInChief #supportthe2nd
3557 2018-03-23 22:23:12 Sir, bump stocks do not turn legal weapins intomachine guns. It is an outright lie.bump stocks were designed to help vets that lost arms fire weapons they are familiar with, pure and simple
3558 2018-03-23 22:23:10 But at least he's banning the bump stocks that the Obama administration unleashed on us!
3559 2018-03-23 22:23:10 DO YOUR RESEARCH! Bump stocks DO NOT turn guns into automatics!!! #StopListeningtotheLEFT!!!
3560 2018-03-23 22:23:06 Les stocks ne sont pas de toi gros dommage mais gg
3561 2018-03-23 22:23:04 Bump stocks do not do that.
3562 2018-03-23 22:23:04 Obama didn’t legalize bump stocks! Either you’re ignorant, or lying. Frankly, it could be both!
3563 2018-03-23 22:22:54 You're lying, again.
Bump stocks can not be regulated by current federal law due not being a mechanical gun part.
3564 2018-03-23 22:22:29 We're all focused on which coins will be added to coinbase/gdax

What if they start adding stocks/metals/others?

#inb4TheyCant
3565 2018-03-23 22:22:25 And Congress agreed to 'looking into' banning bump stocks after #LasVegasShooting - they NEVER DID.  And @SpeakerRyan also agreed to forming a Committee Against Gun Violence - he NEVER answered the calls.  
@GOP - ALL LIARS.

3566 2018-03-23 22:22:24 Are STORMY stocks still legal?

3568 2018-03-23 22:22:13 Trump just pinned bump stocks on Obama. Is Trump bat shit crazy?
3569 2018-03-23 22:22:08 Glad to see PLANNED PARENTHOOD funded in the Omnibus Bill. Your passionate plea for the DREAMERS was a nice touch. Your strong stance BANNING BUMP STOCKS is a good first step. Are you sure you're a Republican? #prochoice #DACA #GunReformNOW
3570 2018-03-23 22:21:56 I could care less .. I would bite to ban bump stocks . Change Buyer age to 21 and gun safety course to buy a gun . Safety course is one time lifetime card
3571 2018-03-23 22:21:53 Between @realDonaldTrump approving the #OmnibusBill and announcing that his DOJ will be taking steps to ban bump stocks, he’s getting sharp criticism from many #MAGA folks on twitter. And it’s hilarious.
3572 2018-03-23 22:21:50 Banning bump stocks isn’t the answer. It’s a cop out.
3573 2018-03-23 22:21:50 What the hell are you talking about banning bump stocks is not gun control.
3574 2018-03-23 22:21:42 One must also assume then that Trump will be a more effective president if he successfully bans bump fire stocks?
3575 2018-03-23 22:21:41 And I guess @realDonaldTrump is gonna blame Obama for the possibility of a trade war and the stocks dropping like hot rocks
3576 2018-03-23 22:21:41 This bill was so bad, he had so much public support he could have beat the swamp on this. He didn't. With the passage, of this #Omnibus, the unilateral banning of bump stocks (who cares) by executive fiat you might as well have brought Obama back. Principles before personalities.
3577 2018-03-23 22:21:39 I have invested almost $200 so far In my acorns account. I’ve lost $8 in the last 2 days. Imagine if you have real money in stocks. Jesus. That’s down 4%
3578 2018-03-23 22:21:37 People who saw the great depression never trusted Banks or Stocks again.
3579 2018-03-23 22:21:24 They probably could have done something but didnt. Automatics are illegal, bump stocks create automatics. Rs take bribes from nra, nra funded by gun manufacturers, which are owned by banks like blackrock, which donate to dems. "All wars are bankers wars".
3580 2018-03-23 22:21:23 Not actually true. It was determined under Obama admin that ATF did not have authority to regulate bump stocks. So, they didn't legalize, but neither did GOP, as far as I know.
3581 2018-03-23 22:21:21 Bump stocks are not that large a deal. I can get the same affect by curling my thumb around my belt loop. Reagan should have never tightened up on full autos though. IF the police need them we do too. Don't worry about that budget, keep your eye forward always Mr. President.
3582 2018-03-23 22:21:02 Did everyone see Trump's latest tweet about the bump stock ban? Trump used the Parkland false flag shooting in Florida to ban bump stocks. Recognize. #qanon #qanon76 #qanon4chan.
3583 2018-03-23 22:20:55 Funny, Fox didn't mention that his Tweet is a blatant lie...Obama did NOT legalize bump stocks, the law, & the GOP prohibited him from doing either

Once again, the POTUS tells absurd lies & you all NEVER say a word

Again, THE POTUS IS LYING ON TWITTER! Outraged?

#Sycophants
3584 2018-03-23 22:20:52 Bump stocks are a device approved by the ATF under Obama... that was him helping unhinged leftists up their killing ability.
3585 2018-03-23 22:20:42 Banning bump stocks is great, but don’t let them pretend like it’s enough. It’s a bandaid on a gaping wound. We can do better. #March4OurLives
3586 2018-03-23 22:20:39 LoL Nobody Gives a Damn about bump stocks. We Americans are Concerned with AMERICA. The Abomination you Signed is Dispicable. We Americans Don't Give a Damn about DACA. ILLEGAL. MAGA
3587 2018-03-23 22:20:32 No veto and a ban on bump stocks? What is going on in that tiny brain of yours today? Your adoring fans are going to be pissed!
3588 2018-03-23 22:20:15 ATF already deemed bump stocks regulation was outside it’s purview. It’s up to congress to create new laws regarding them.
3589 2018-03-23 22:20:13 My case looks fine. There's only holes because of out-of-stocks
3590 2018-03-23 22:20:02 Agreed.  A bad tweet for Trump and the NRA.  How many incidents involved bump stocks?  Do we even know what really happened in Vegas? What other devices will be banned under this?  I feel like we are being played as stupid.
3591 2018-03-23 22:19:57 The Department of Justice will change regulations to categorize bump stocks as "machine guns" under federal law — effectively banning them. This announcement comes the day ahead of the nationwide March for Our Lives rally.
3592 2018-03-23 22:19:38 going out to buy 3 bump stocks right now.  1 for all my AR15's
3593 2018-03-23 22:19:38 Can't bump-stocks be easily produced with a 3D printer?
3594 2018-03-23 22:19:38 Obama did not “approve” bump stocks he found that there was no law to prevent their sale when he asked congress to make one guess who stepped in and stopped it that’s right THE #NRA and so congress did nothing.... so you have said I another LIE!
3595 2018-03-23 22:19:27 Our spending will destroy this country not bump stocks. Very sad day.
3596 2018-03-23 22:19:16 Stocks around the world plunge on fears of a trade war between US and China.
3597 2018-03-23 22:18:56 Bump stocks were legal throughout the entire Obama presidency. If you don't believe it, Google it up!

3601 2018-03-23 22:18:12 Wrong. Bump stocks were used in the Las Vegas shooting. They were not used in #Parkland.

3603 2018-03-23 22:18:08 So bump stocks remian legal. They dont turn any gun into a machine gun.
3604 2018-03-23 22:17:43 I really want to start investing in stocks but I have no idea where or how to start.
3605 2018-03-23 22:17:42 He signed it.... and banned bump stocks 
3606 2018-03-23 22:17:36 Some positives vs the last time we hit this level in Feb. Fewer new lows. Before it was everything and now it’s the big names, like Facebook and Google and bank stocks getting the worst of it. Hate to close a week the way we did but a retest could be a big positive for later yr.
3607 2018-03-23 22:17:32 It dovetails so well with the Truck Nutz for gun stocks
3608 2018-03-23 22:17:27 Under Obama admin, it was determined that no existing laws allowed the banning of bump stocks. So, Obama did not make them legal  (cuz presidents don't create laws) but found them to be legal.
3609 2018-03-23 22:17:22 Bump stocks are to assist the handicapped. Research. Don’t fall for their schemes. #2A
3610 2018-03-23 22:17:18 Stocks went tumbling all due to the @potus being psychotic or thinking about the good times w/ the playmate and pornstar.  Thanks a lot. #weredoomed
3611 2018-03-23 22:17:17 Obama didn't endorse bump stocks. They were legal bc it wasn't mechanical.
Trump got one right, to say he is a good or great prez....not even close
3612 2018-03-23 22:17:14 Not saying bump stocks are necessary (though some people may disagree with you), but I’m saying it’s unnecessary and ludicrous to ban the free trade and use of a weapon and it’s accessories.
3613 2018-03-23 22:17:13 Quit lying. Bump stocks were already legal when he took office.
3614 2018-03-23 22:16:55 The Obama administration didn't have a law to use to ban them, and with a #gop congress, not chance of getting a law passed. ATF said bump stocks are not a firearm for them them to regulate.  #lyingDon
3615 2018-03-23 22:16:44 And you signed into law a measure that would allow those with mental issues to purchase firearms - not exactly a bright idea but you were told to do so by the NRA.  And "believe me" if Obama were still President there would be no more bump stocks -- which under you we still have.
3616 2018-03-23 22:16:37 Did the Parkland murderer use a bump stock?  NO!  So a ban on bump stocks means nothing.
3617 2018-03-23 22:16:36 Time to send Trump a massage dump are stocks
3618 2018-03-23 22:16:31 .@realDonaldTrump issued another LIE regarding bump stocks on the eve of #MarchForOurLives just so he can say 'see I'm all for #GunReform " but of course we all know that unless the .@NRA says it's ok it's never going to happen. Remember when he said he'd push for higher
3619 2018-03-23 22:16:26 Bump stocks can be easily made.  Banning means nothing.  Don’t waste your precious time Mr President
3620 2018-03-23 22:16:26 I agree, Henry VIII, etc.  has power, we must try to come together & stop being so cruel to each other or this  is going to implode #MAK the stocks r down
3621 2018-03-23 22:16:23 I should invest in 3D printers stocks.  They're probably gonna sell like HOTCAKES!!!
3622 2018-03-23 22:16:19 Obama DID NOT legalize bump stocks like Trump just Tweeted.  The law simply did not allow Obama to prohibit bump stocks.  If congress wanted to regulate them they could have.  President Trump is WRONG! Bump stocks weren't considered an issue until after the Vegas shootings.
3623 2018-03-23 22:16:17 When?? When did “Obama administration legalise bump stocks”? Tell me. Tell the American people. Prove it... you can’t? No, of course you can’t, because it isn’t true.
3624 2018-03-23 22:16:08 Prefacing anything with “as a” is the liberal go to because it’s all identity politics.  That said, I don’t care about bump stocks as long as nothing is earmarked.
3625 2018-03-23 22:16:03 The DOJ is funny. They think  banning bump stocks is going to prevent 3D printing. They need to start understanding tech
3626 2018-03-23 22:15:50 Obama legalized 'bump stocks'? Do you take all Americans to be as stupid as your followers???
3627 2018-03-23 22:15:41 First bump stocks then all ar15s and others like it then all guns put together then more victims and some idiot people just don’t get that
3628 2018-03-23 22:15:38 I don't think many conservatives would mind a ban on bump stocks, but no one should think they would go further than that.
3629 2018-03-23 22:15:37 And Trump is just about always wrong. Bump Stocks didn’t exist in the same form when Obama was President.
3630 2018-03-23 22:15:35 The Obama administration did not legalise bump stocks you lying maggot. A scientific expert in the ATF determined they were not illegal.
3631 2018-03-23 22:15:29 Evil people buy bump stocks.
3632 2018-03-23 22:15:29 Does EVERYTHING you do need to relate to the previous administration? And you KNOW this is dishonest—when bump stocks were 1st manufactured, the ATF had no law from Congress to make them illegal. That had nothing to do with PRESIDENT Obama.
3633 2018-03-23 22:15:25 @realDonaldTrump .  I read that DJT tweet, and it's 100% factual.  Bump stocks remained legal throughout the entire Obama presidency.  If you don't believe it, Google it up!

3634 2018-03-23 22:15:21 Um. I think the Base likes bump stocks. They're pretty pissed about the budget deal. Are you sure this is a good idea? Maybe you should insult someone instead. They always like that.
3635 2018-03-23 22:15:15 That is not really true. 

The truth: there was not a specific law against bump stocks which would have allowed the Obama administration to either regulate or outlaw them.  Blame the NRA for the limited scope of enforcement powers given to ATF.

Trump and truth are still feuding.
3636 2018-03-23 22:15:10 There's nothing wrong with bump stocks...it's the person who chooses to use it for evil. Millions of recreational users use bump stocks and don't kill people. Remember, evil is in the heart, not the tool. Think back to Boston, are you going to outlaw pressure cookers?
3637 2018-03-23 22:15:04 I reckon he figured he may as well ban bump stocks while everyone was already pissed at him.
3638 2018-03-23 22:14:51 "legalized"  Try again.  The ATF decided it could not regulate bump stocks during the Obama administration. That is not legalizing it.
3639 2018-03-23 22:14:40 After signing the Omni-BS bill, @realDonaldTrump takes to Twitter to bash bump stocks in an effort to reconcile with his base.
3640 2018-03-23 22:14:38 Bump stocks are needed b/c of politicians and swamp people like you
3641 2018-03-23 22:14:30 Afternoon Donnie Dumbass. Again you're putting out half truths and outright lies. The ATF during the Obama Administration did rule on bump stocks citing an existing law, but found because the stocks are not mechanical didn't fall under their jurisdiction. Why do you lie?!
3642 2018-03-23 22:14:22 Obama did not legalize bump stocks. He determined that existing law did not allow him to regulate them. Are you issuing new JOB KILLING regulations? Isn’t this precisely the sort of executive overreach you accused Obama of doing?
3643 2018-03-23 22:14:08 This is a money making scam. After a few days of tanking. Trump’s buddies will have bought up all the cheap stocks. Then Trump will reverse course. Markets will go back. And insiders will line their pockets.
3644 2018-03-23 22:14:02 Bump stocks are useless. They destroy your accuracy. However this still is an unacceptable infringement of law abiding citizens 2nd amendment rights.
3645 2018-03-23 22:13:59 Obama didn't legalize Bump stocks. Stop lying!
3646 2018-03-23 22:13:49 Donnie, again these are lies.  The GOP REFUSED to pass gun control. Bump stocks were not illegal. You need to get your facts straight before you write more lies. It’s embarrassing. #resign
3647 2018-03-23 22:13:41 See a smart person would know that bump stocks aren't necessary if you know how a ruffle.  A smart person would know what a binary trigger is and why it's much more dangerous and still legal.
3648 2018-03-23 22:13:37 He's not even right. Bump stocks were already legal, Obama wanted to change that but Congress did not. Trump might not even be able to do so without Congress passing a law. bUt ObAmA!!11!
3649 2018-03-23 22:13:30 "Well, I had to take some action, with the BLOOD of 17 kids still fresh on their CLASSROOM floor.  And since bump stocks don't mean a RAT's A^^ to shooters, this was ZERO price to pay for ARMING TEACHERS in the classroom."  DJT
3650 2018-03-23 22:12:47 Bumper stocks ditto
3651 2018-03-23 22:12:41 Bump Stocks banned. You have quit being the President of the people. You are now the Special Interest and Liberal Causes supporter.
3652 2018-03-23 22:12:37 A ban on bump stocks is a ban on triggers, magazines and semi-autos… this is a slippery slope this will be further expanded and exploited
3653 2018-03-23 22:12:30 Don’t talk to me about “bump stocks” explain why you signed the horrible spending bill!!!
3654 2018-03-23 22:12:13 Its true. But that's also a stupid thought process. Stocks are the same way. Most buyers dont give a crap about the company they are investing in, they just want it to go up.
3655 2018-03-23 22:12:12 Respectfully sir, you are ignorant on this issue.  Bumps stocks don't turn semiautomatic weapons in to "machine guns.". You going to ban belt loops and thumbs too?
3656 2018-03-23 22:12:04 No, you lying POS, Obama did not “legalize bump stocks”.

Does a day go by that you don’t lie, obfuscate, or divert?

Please #resign now, if you even just like your country a little bit.

3658 2018-03-23 22:11:52 You do realize that the Parkland school shooting in Florida led to this, the false flag one that many people exposed. Trump used this to ban bump stocks. Let that sink in.
3659 2018-03-23 22:11:37 Legalise Bum Stocks
3660 2018-03-23 22:11:26 Salmon Stalin lies.  He lies multiple times per day. He ended DACA unilaterally but blamed Dems. Now he is blaming Obama for bump stocks being sold, total lie.
3661 2018-03-23 22:11:15 I needed the smile , with the signing of the spending bill, the ban on bump stocks , this Friday feels like a Monday.
3662 2018-03-23 22:11:14 The bad idea is the stupidity of banning bump stocks.  Let that one sink in.
3663 2018-03-23 22:11:12 The Justice Department proposes banning bump stocks for guns, doing so a day before nationwide gun control marches -- ABC News
3664 2018-03-23 22:10:48 @realDonaldTrump Obama did not approve the sale of bump stocks.  Obama syndrome.
3665 2018-03-23 22:10:46 Speaking of’Stocks’. You are ‘Killing’ them. #Economycrash in 3...2...1
3666 2018-03-23 22:10:45 ATF approved applications because the law did not permit them to prohibit Bump Stocks, so why is this @BarackObama fault ?
3667 2018-03-23 22:10:42 Jim Cramer:  Stocks are afraid of this President.
3668 2018-03-23 22:10:32 Well, banning bump stocks sounds easy. We’ll see what happens after that “comment period” you mentioned. And what about banning high powered rifles (like AR-15), and high capacity magazines? Huh?
3669 2018-03-23 22:10:22 Is not about policy. He's openly lying to Americans who need support and blaming everyone but the responsible party, in this case guns. I don't support banning bump stocks, i support banning the killing tool you put the bump stock on.
3670 2018-03-23 22:10:21 You are lying and it is provable by anyone with Google.

Obama did not approve Bump Stocks.  His administration simply found that the current LAWS did not prohibit them.  Obama tried for gun control but the GOP pushed back every time.

You lie because you can't handle the truth.
3671 2018-03-23 22:10:20 You REALIZE you are the ONLY "president" who EVER talked constantly constantly constantly CONSTANTLY about OTHER Presidents RIGHT???

I'm glad bump stocks are banned - even if you had to assure us that Obama was evil in the process.
3672 2018-03-23 22:10:20 Also, the Chinese $$ must find a "home", so they come in and puchase US stocks and US real estate, bidding up the prices of Trump assets. Again, his gripe is ???
3673 2018-03-23 22:10:18 Trump tweeted that Obama legalized bump stocks. Obama never approved of bump stocks. Two bump stock models weren't violating the law then, so they were not prohibited. Trump's just trying to make himself feel better about backing down on his bluff about signing the omnibus bill.
3674 2018-03-23 22:10:13 How about AR-15s and other semi-automatic weapons?  NRA doesn't care about bump stocks, they are banned at their shooting range.
3675 2018-03-23 22:10:05 I sold out of 400K of stocks on Wednesday. Man, I really had a good premonition the Dow was going down. When bad news is ignored = bull market, when bad news is heavily reacted against = bear market
3676 2018-03-23 22:10:05 This is misleading.  During Obama's admin bump stocks were not illegal.  Therefore manufacturers were allowed to make them. They were not "legalized". If there is no law preventing or allowing something, it doesn't mean they are legalized.
3677 2018-03-23 22:10:01 A rapid fire magazine fed automatic rifle designed for.military use.  Bump stocks make a semi a full auto.
3678 2018-03-23 22:09:52 That's a lie. The Obama Administration did not legalize bump stocks. Legal experts determined, at that time, the current law didn't allow for the regulation of bump stocks.
3679 2018-03-23 22:09:47 Sure you will but bump stocks are only part of the problem. The semi- automatic AR-15 loaded with bullets does the damage. Where's the ban on assault weapons? What's a matter, Donnie? NRA got your tongue?
3680 2018-03-23 22:09:38 Bump stocks were approved for sale by the former Dem Pres
3681 2018-03-23 22:09:38 Bump Stocks? On the day of signing a Pact w/the Devil, @realDonaldTrump is tweeting abt bump stocks?  insult to injury
3682 2018-03-23 22:09:37 Bump stocks are not a petard upon which I care to be hoisted. They have nothing to do with the right to bear arms.
3683 2018-03-23 22:09:23 It shouldn't be about gun reform either. Guns were around pre shootings. Should be about keeping kids safe. Banning bump stocks don't fkn do it. Or a few types of guns. That's starts a snowball effect till 2nd Amendments gone. Putting cops in schools does.
3684 2018-03-23 22:09:17 First “he wants DACA” now “Obama wants bump stocks”. Even my dog and cat knows he’s lying.
3685 2018-03-23 22:09:00 Trust me, bump stocks are the ONLY reason that shootings are happening...
3686 2018-03-23 22:08:58 Not trying to start an argument, just asking an honest question.  I’m probably not informed enough about this subject to comment, but I understood that the Obama Administration couldn’t stop the legalization of bump stocks because they didn’t have any legal authority to do so.
3687 2018-03-23 22:08:52 Banning bump stocks isn't low hanging fruit. It is fruit that has already fallen off the tree. Is this how big bad Derelict Donald will address the NRA "Patriots"?  PS.  I am now very afraid to open my next 401k statement. Thanks for nothing. #gunsense #StockMarketCrash
3688 2018-03-23 22:08:49 Why in all that you say / tweet do you have to take a snide swipe at someone in an attemp to make yourself look better? One might be led to belive that you have an inferiority complex! Banning bump stocks is the very least you can do. What next?
3689 2018-03-23 22:08:46 So, now that Trump has moved to ban "bump stocks", why not assault weapons? Nothing in the 2nd Amendment guarantees the right to own weapons of war? Or large capacity ammo clips. I guess it'd happen if the "Fraud and Nonsense Network" pushed for it on its morning Trump-cast.
3690 2018-03-23 22:08:37 I wish you were more worried about the border than Bump Stocks... I don't know if you can recover from this one. You let Ryan & Mcconnell play you like a dog. I still back you but wont believe you until we see results on the border
3691 2018-03-23 22:08:36 President Obama DID NOT LEGALIZE BUMP STOCKS.  Everyday you assault and insult the American people with your lies.  When will this nightmare be over?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?   #ImpeachTrump
3692 2018-03-23 22:08:31 What about closing the loopholes in  the background check system?? Bump stocks are not the fix
3693 2018-03-23 22:08:30 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Understand that Bump Stocks do not make  an automatic "assault" weapon but are for the usage of disabled hunters. I will ask you the same as of @JohnCornyn  when will see background checks for @HomeDepot purchases? See how stupid that sounds? #2ADefenders
3694 2018-03-23 22:08:28 wait are they actually banning bump stocks?
3695 2018-03-23 22:07:59 Rumpy Pumpy Bunny Thumper are going to NRA age restrict guns like you promised. PS Obama didn't allow bump stocks Republican Senate did. DUMP THE TRUMP 2018
3696 2018-03-23 22:07:53 And then why is it that Obama didn’t prohibited bump stocks as Trump is doing now?
3697 2018-03-23 22:07:51 There's a market for every type of consumable. Those can be flooded by other countries products. The stock market can not be flooded, except by money. Countries are not buying up our stocks. Take a class in economics.
3698 2018-03-23 22:07:49 Why does this remind me of throwing rocks at tanks..

But it's too much to look at our own laws?

No bump stocks or assault weapons

Raise the minimum age

Require training and background checks

No guns to mentally incompetent, deranged, or domestically violent!

It's EASY!
3699 2018-03-23 22:07:49 ...and sickness all lie within. If I had the extra money, I would buy up as much in stocks as I could. The government needs to sink a lot...
3700 2018-03-23 22:07:44 @jonsnowC4 mark Zuckerberg knew the story of selling our details was getting out has he sold chunks of his his own stocks in Facebook threeweeks before ....
3701 2018-03-23 22:07:42 You have a losing streak going today. Signing that loser omnibus bill and now bump stocks? Bump stocks don’t really make rifles truly machine guns. It’s another mini step to confiscation. It does nothing to make anyone safer.
3702 2018-03-23 22:07:37 Lie, the ATF decided it could not regulate bump stocks during the Obama administration....and why are you whining about the 2A? Your followers won’t be happy again.
3703 2018-03-23 22:07:37 Trump offering up banning Bump Stocks. BFD
YouTube has plenty of instructional videos of how to Bump Fire a semiautomatic rifle without a Bump Stock. 
It's not the stocks it's, the weapon that is the culprit.
3704 2018-03-23 22:07:37 You won’t when the boys from down under lower your stocks 
3705 2018-03-23 22:07:36 the only thing dumber that putting a bump stock on a rifle is banning bump stocks
3706 2018-03-23 22:07:29 Looking at WBA, HSY, PRU, PR, WFC on the graphs--niiiice! So Prudential FPE for 2020 is $13.68 and the stock now is at $105. Are Insurance stocks scary?  Are they only cheap when PE is 5?
3707 2018-03-23 22:07:29 Obama didn't legalize bump stocks.  Congress never made them illegal.  You banned them by imperial decree.  BAD IDEA.  You also funded planned parenthood, how many campaign promises are you gonna break today?
3708 2018-03-23 22:07:27 Lol tell the truth you couldn't care less about bump stocks. If Reagan approved them instead of Obama, you wouldn't do squat
3709 2018-03-23 22:07:21 Banned bump stocks.. the pussification of America is full tilt right now.
3710 2018-03-23 22:07:20 Well it's a good thing bump stocks don't turn a semi automatic into a full automatic then! Because a machine gun is or is not. This is so ignorant of you.
3711 2018-03-23 22:07:15 Trump just did what Hilary never could and banned bump stocks. Checkmate, libs
3712 2018-03-23 22:07:15 Obama didn’t legalize bump stocks. The device was reviewed and found that it couldn’t be classified as a weapon because it didn’t have a mechanical part.  Technicality,yes. But u r spreading false news again. Get and state the correct facts
3713 2018-03-23 22:07:09 AP: President Trump says his admin will ban bump stock devices that "turn legal weapons into illegal machines." Justice Dept. said Friday it has started process to amend fed'l firearms regs to clarify that bump stocks are defined as illegal machine guns.
3714 2018-03-23 22:07:05 A total lie. They did not. They never specifically dealt with bump stocks at all. Just more BS from you over your damaged ego because Obama was so much better than you at, well, literally everything
3715 2018-03-23 22:06:40 Liberals are morons they don't even know that binary triggers are much more effective than bump stocks hell you hold a gun right and you're wearing a windbreaker you can make any stock a bump stock
3716 2018-03-23 22:06:34 CLOSING TECHNICAL SIGNAL:  with stocks in correction mode, the call is #Float but a #Lock call is the sure thing.  Be on guard for a reversal
3717 2018-03-23 22:06:30 Trumps DOJ banning bump stocks. 
Thoughts and prayers, Dana, thoughts and prayers.
3718 2018-03-23 22:06:28 WTF are you blabbing about?... Show us the friggin' law that Obama signed that made "bump stocks" legal where they weren't before. We'll all wait.
3719 2018-03-23 22:06:27 It's so stinking stupid! Bump stocks can be made at home! Not that hard! And machine guns are impractical anyways because they shoot a flurry of bullets ($) that hit indiscriminately, not specific!
3720 2018-03-23 22:06:20 With as much stock as he's already sold & the recent drop in FB stocks I HIGHLY doubt Zuckerberg GAS.
3721 2018-03-23 22:06:20 I don't care about bump stocks, but between this and not vetoing an abomination of a bill, today you've shown conservatives how you plan to avoid getting re-elected.
3722 2018-03-23 22:06:09 Mr. President, I support you 100% but bump stocks don't make a weapon automatic. They just absorb extra recoil from the weapon. It doesn't change rate of fire.
3723 2018-03-23 22:05:43 Well in A.R. 15 is a semi automatic rifle so it functions just like a semi automatic pistol. But stocks are not as dangerous as you would like them today it wouldn’t mean anything to me. You can still only fire as fast as your finger can pull the trigger.
3724 2018-03-23 22:05:23 Stop Lieing. Bump stocks always been legal since they were sold to the public..
3725 2018-03-23 22:05:22 Sandy Hook killer didn't use bump stocks 
Columbine killers didn't use bump stocks 
Virginia Tech killer didn't use bump stocks 
Pulse killer didn't use bump stocks

Charlotte church killer didn't use bump stocks

3726 2018-03-23 22:05:17 I’m a law abiding citizen and appreciate bump stocks. It allows me to protect myself (if I ever need to) against multiple people. You never know what will happen in this world.
3727 2018-03-23 22:05:16 Nobre @benebarbosa_mvb poderia elucidar para mim, como leigo brasileiro o que são as Bump Stocks que Obama fez e o Trump quer revogar? É o cidadão americano não poder mais de uma metralhadora?
3728 2018-03-23 22:05:15 After signing a bill that gives $$$ to sanctuary cities you decide to ban BUMP STOCKS ?   Be careful.
3729 2018-03-23 22:05:12 Thanks on the bump stocks, but it isn't enough. Re Obama, you're full of shit as usual.
3730 2018-03-23 22:05:07 MSNBC and various Hollywood celebrities will undoubtedly come out in favor of bump stocks shortly.
3731 2018-03-23 22:05:02 Did anyone else just see what happened? Trump used the Parkland false flag shooting to ban bump stocks. Can you fucking believe it?
3732 2018-03-23 22:05:02 Because they don’t alter the gun’s internal mechanisms, they were considered lawful. So no, Obama did NOT legalize bump stocks. The ATF only verified an existing law. Get your facts straight Liar! #ImpeachTrump #LiarInChief
3733 2018-03-23 22:04:57 Trump is lying (as usual), No the Obama administration didn't legalize bump stocks, they were already legal when Obama came to office. In fact he tried to put tight regulations on the ownership and usage of guns and bump stocks.
3734 2018-03-23 22:04:55 umm Obama didn't legalize bump stocks... They've ALWAYS been legal. It's Congress's job to make something illegal. The ATF simply approved them because they didn't violate any law by congress.  If you want to make them illegal then talk to congress.  DUH!
3735 2018-03-23 22:04:55 #Trump's ban on bump stocks on the eve of the #March4OurLives event is a sham. @realDonaldTrump @POTUS the marchers and American people want an assault weapons ban! Your "do the least thing the gun lobby agrees on" is not fooling anyone. #CheapTrick #FakeNews
3736 2018-03-23 22:04:53 It’s not a lie. But I support obama not banning bump stocks
3737 2018-03-23 22:04:42 Someone notify me when the tech stocks bump back on Tuesday #scaredtocheck #nolossuntilyousell #thanksTrump
3738 2018-03-23 22:04:40 Ok trump. They didn’t “legalize” bump stocks. They were determined to not be illegal under the current regulations. Also, you realize how asinine it is to say “ban the thing that makes the deadly thing more deadly”. Why not just ban the actual deadly thing?
3739 2018-03-23 22:04:34 I still stand by Trump but I don't agree with this bill or the bump stocks crap. But you can support someone and not agree with all they say or do.
3740 2018-03-23 22:04:32 Bump Stocks do not turn semi automatic firearms into machine guns. Someone can bumpfire with a belt, or even with their hands alone. This is a mistake and another infringement on our 2nd amendment rights.
3741 2018-03-23 22:04:31 Even with a 'bump stock' it's still ONE bullet per ONE trigger pull.  This is NOT a 'machine gun'.  Not only that 99+% of all bump stocks are junk P.O.S that are nothing but a gimmick.  Adding to that, machine guns are not illegal to own as long as you have the correct permit.
3742 2018-03-23 22:04:30 El stupid, the Obama administration was following the law since “fire stocks”, did not alert the internal mechanics of the weapon to make it a machine gun. Your promises are just as valid as an enema to someone with diarrhea.
3743 2018-03-23 22:04:27 You are a blatant liar. Get your facts straight before you just spew out ridiculous falsehoods. BO did NOT legalize bump stocks.
3744 2018-03-23 22:04:12 Anyone out here know anything about day trading or penny stocks
3745 2018-03-23 22:04:11 I have a hard time believing Pres Obama legalized bump stocks- Fake
3746 2018-03-23 22:04:00 President Obama did NOT "legalize" bump stocks. Every attempt for Gun Control was met by @GOP fear mongering abt "taking away All guns" And as for any promise from a despot lsuch as you I won't hold my breath.
3747 2018-03-23 22:03:57 I don’t want to talk about bump stocks!  I voted in a president that would #DrainTheDeepStateSwamp #BuildTheWall #DefundPP!!  Not put us another trillion in debt!!
3748 2018-03-23 22:03:56 Who the hell cares about bump stocks! With what you did today it doesn’t matter a damn but!
3749 2018-03-23 22:03:54 Bump stocks are useless anyway for someone wanting to defend themselves.. you can't hit shit with a bump stock but you can shoot alot of rounds.
3750 2018-03-23 22:03:51 Ant...hes making a point.  Conceding something that we all know means nothing, but can score some big political points.  I BANNED BUMP STOCKS, I'M DOING ALL I CAN.
3751 2018-03-23 22:03:47 For 8 yrs we heard Obama was coming for your guns. Today Trump blamed Obama for making bump stocks legal. Boy can he sling the sh- -
3752 2018-03-23 22:03:43 Whut? You are misinformed.  Bump Stocks don't turn semi-automatic guns into machine guns period.
3753 2018-03-23 22:03:39 A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed. Where here does it say that we can’t have bump stocks, or that they’re illegal. No one can take a responsible mans gun nor attachment.
3754 2018-03-23 22:03:37 In 2010 didn’t the ATF rule that only Congress can ban bump stocks not DOJ?
3755 2018-03-23 22:03:33 just in NBC only reports on stocks if it drops if a Republican is President.  propaganda news - tabloid news - failed to say deal is coming soon with South Korea in trade.  get a grip.
3756 2018-03-23 22:03:25 Ban the guns and keep the bump stocks
3757 2018-03-23 22:03:22 No one cares abt effing bump stocks, its the principle. He's signaling that he's mostly concerned with dacas, gun stuff & what the lib media writes about him.
3758 2018-03-23 22:03:20 Bump stocks make assault weapons inaccurate, but they’re great if you want to kill everyone in front of you.
3759 2018-03-23 22:03:19 You lie. The truth is the ATF decided it could not regulate bump stocks during the Obama administration. #fakenews #FakePresident
3760 2018-03-23 22:03:08 Evil people with access to bump stocks is the problem, bro

Dumb conservative talking points are also the problem
3761 2018-03-23 22:03:05 The DOJ IS BANNING BUMP STOCKS WHICH IS ANOTHER STEP FORWARD.  The kids are making a difference and the times they are a changing
3762 2018-03-23 22:02:56 There are also probably switching their stocks around to different places and counting their money in the banks 
3763 2018-03-23 22:02:47 For those that don't know & I apologize if I misread Monkeys followers, the reason Onama did not ban bump stocks is because the Law doesn't support it. The law says multiple shots w one activation of the trigger, a bumpstock actually requires the trigger b activated each time. 1/
3764 2018-03-23 22:02:39 I am a gun owner and bump stocks should have never been allowed.
3765 2018-03-23 22:02:38 Bump Stocks is far as he should go, after today President Trump should get back to the way we want him to be, draining the swamp, tax cuts, doing away with regulations, etc, MAGA.
3766 2018-03-23 22:02:21 As usual trump politicizes the Bump stocks legalization done under Pres. Obama (Obama bad, Obama bad).It was done by default if you want to look at it administratively. Blame games over. The truth is that a Bump stock Manufacturer proved by legal definition of a firearm
3767 2018-03-23 22:02:19 Oh my God!  Do don’t remember how the rebs refused to pass ANYTHING he purposed on bump stocks & chi’s after Sandy Hook & after Atlanta?  Really, u don’t remember that?  If not, I am concerned you have dementia.  Jeez, Obama has been out of office for over a year!  Give it up!
3768 2018-03-23 22:02:09 Listen this isn't about bump stocks! Banning bump stocks will do nothing but embolden Progressive left to ban all of our guns! Terrorists Bill Ayers-Bernandine Dohrn "wished" they did more bombings~Rwandan genocide happened with Chinese machetes & WJC-SRice looked the other way!
3769 2018-03-23 22:02:04 That's factually incorrect. The #Obama Administration's #ATF found no reason to ban bump stocks because the law doesn't allow them to do so. As any #Liberal knows. A bump stock is just a spring and a hunk of plastic - you need to get the #DOJ or #Congress involved. 1/
3770 2018-03-23 22:02:03 You should have banned chain migration and the immigration lottery - they are way more dangerous than bump stocks.
3771 2018-03-23 22:01:59 Tell me about it after your daily lecture from Kamala Harris about White privilege. Now he's screwing around with bump-stocks. Trump and the GOP are finished.
3772 2018-03-23 22:01:53 It's about this business executive who saved up 30 million yen to buy stocks to take over this company he works in. At that moment his kid is kidnapped and the kidnapper is asking for 30 mil. So this guy has to choose to save the child and go bankrupt or let him die.
3773 2018-03-23 22:01:51 bump stocks are fun to shoot, burns through lots of ammo, but a good time. Shame
3774 2018-03-23 22:01:49 So are you saying ignore all their bs and everything that comes up from past admins faults are now trumps? Bump stocks were ruled on under obama admin. I actually like their ruling better because no matter which way people twist it bumpstocks are still one bullet per trigger pull
3775 2018-03-23 22:01:36 “As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.”

Citigroup statement?

Nope. Trump statement.
3776 2018-03-23 22:01:25 Obama did not approve Bump Stocks.  His administration simply found that the current laws did not prohibit them.
Obama tried for gun control but the GOP Congress nixed it.
3777 2018-03-23 22:01:24 Really, we don’t need bump stocks on the street you .....
3778 2018-03-23 22:01:23 A real leader simply does what he's supposed to do and doesn't complain on Twitter. Ban all machine guns, not just the bump stocks, and become a real hero. Unless you don't have the guts to do so.
3779 2018-03-23 22:01:18 My aunty said to marry a white man with a degree and stocks and bonds and im over here like im extremely under qualified lmaoooo im an average looking college drop out living at my granny house who got $47 to her name. 
3780 2018-03-23 22:01:13 One hopes the $BTC does NOT follow the stock market jitters, in fact, this is a huge test of iF risk-aversion funds pour INTO Bitcoin, rather than away from it. This scenario has not been in play before, as stocks have not corrected past 10% in a long time. 5% was hit 2 years ago
3781 2018-03-23 22:01:11 Who the fuck cares about bump stocks. Nothing of value is gained or lost with or without them.
3782 2018-03-23 22:01:10 Terrible ideal.... Bump stocks do not make them a machine gun, this is ridiculous.  Do not infringe on the right to bear arms under any circumstances.
3783 2018-03-23 22:01:09 LIE, LIE, LIE. AGAIN.
Obama did NOT legalized bump stocks.

No wonder why TRUMP said "I love the poorly educated" - they can be manipulated easily with lies.
3784 2018-03-23 22:01:07 Bump Stocks ! You urinated on your people today and you tweet about bump stocks ...
3785 2018-03-23 22:00:58 where does forex come in because even bank use ur money in the bank to lend other people money, trade forex and stocks too
3786 2018-03-23 22:00:54 Bump stocks make weapons inaccurate anyways. Take em. We don't need em. If you can't hit what you shoot, improving the firing rate does nothing. And making weapons illegal doesn't stop crime rates.
3787 2018-03-23 22:00:46 Is youtube really banning videos of bump stocks? That is censorship. I made sure to download your video, it is a very good demonstration
3788 2018-03-23 22:00:44 Bump stocks are a joke if you care about accuracy at all that is lol.  Work that trigger finger harder!! Lol.
3789 2018-03-23 22:00:43 Read up on Bump Stocks during Obama's term. He's lying his ass off.
3790 2018-03-23 22:00:32 Unless the laws of the land have changed.  DOJ cannot make bump stocks illegal. Not that I'd ever use one. 

DOJ was unable to make bump stocks illegal before,  nothing has changed, same result.
3791 2018-03-23 22:00:26 RW: President Trump has been calling for a full ban on bump stocks for months, following the October 2017 Las Vegas massacre.
3792 2018-03-23 22:00:22 Actually what the ATF ruled was that the law didn't give them the authority to ban bump stocks. In this case, it's good that you only nominal respect for the rule of law, sir.
3793 2018-03-23 22:00:09 I wish you had vetoed that ridiculous spending bill instead of wasting time on banning bump stocks. You really let me down Mr President.
3794 2018-03-23 22:00:01 Vegas shooter didn’t have a problem killing 58 people and injuring an other 851 with AR’s equipped with bum stocks. 

Your argument is invalid
3795 2018-03-23 21:59:47 Haha! You’re so impressed by his prowess you attribute pretty much everything to Obama! You must feel so puny, sliming along in his shadow.

Good deal on the bump stocks, btw. Far too little, way too late for hundreds, but better for the USA than your other “accomplishments.”
3796 2018-03-23 21:59:46 Bump stocks are a problem as nobody needs a fully automatic weapon. But the people are the main problem.
3797 2018-03-23 21:59:34 Only because the company lied about the intended use ofbump stocks. Slide Fire said they were intended for people whose hands couldn’t handle the regular stock, implying these would be for those with disability. Lying NRA, lying Trump.
3798 2018-03-23 21:59:19 Obama did not legalize bump stocks. The law at the time did not allow his administration to prohibit them.
3799 2018-03-23 21:59:18 I would posit that evil people with bump stocks are the problem.
3800 2018-03-23 21:58:58 Ur timing is impeccable.  The day b4 million march against gun violence ant the GOP's lack or concern, u pass have Der Fuhrer's right hand man issue a rule banning bump stocks.  Unfortunately, the smart ppl figured u out long ago and know u r the most tremendous BS ARTIST!
3801 2018-03-23 21:58:41 This is precisely why he has authorized such a large #military budget. Let's be clear the money is NOT for #veterans. It's for new equipment. And his entire team has probably #invested in the #stocks of the #contractors where the funds will be allocated.
3802 2018-03-23 21:58:40 I think our stocks just took a bump ya happy now smh
3803 2018-03-23 21:58:40 Yes, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms  (during the Obama Administration) determined they could not regulate bump stocks because they weren't a firearm. I believe they also made that determination during your administration.  Your stupidity is showing again.  #ResignNOW
3804 2018-03-23 21:58:35 Bump stocks increase firing rate, but at the expense of accuracy. That's not a weapon for defence or hunting, but for slaughter.
3805 2018-03-23 21:58:30 I agree bump stocks must be banned, but Trump’s verbiage of “turn legal guns into illegal machine guns” has a built in loop hole that has been tread over so many times by the NRA it might as well be an expressway.
3806 2018-03-23 21:58:25 Oil stocks totally did not buy this rally today, top is in IMHO
3807 2018-03-23 21:58:15 Roughly half of VRA Portfolio; my top growth stocks/story stocks. Low beta, barely hit in most market sell offs. 300%-1000% + upside potential. Long term holdings. The rest; broad mkt ETFs. I keep total portfolio size to <10-12 positions at all times. Focused, manageable.
3808 2018-03-23 21:58:07 Ignorant liberals if you know how to do it you can get the same effect as a bump stock if you're wearing windbreaker but nobody's talking about is Obama also authorized binary triggers much more dangerous than stupid bump stocks
3809 2018-03-23 21:58:05 Look a token gesture.  Only one mass shooting used bump stocks.
3810 2018-03-23 21:58:04 (2) OBAMA did NOT legalize bump stocks. It was determined that they could NOT be regulated because there were no laws in effect that pertained to bump stocks as they themselves were not "firearms".
3811 2018-03-23 21:58:04 Well, then I guess you will not ban bump stocks, they DO NOT change a semi automatic into a fully automatic firearm.
3812 2018-03-23 21:57:17 Please leave bump stocks alone and support the 2A.
3813 2018-03-23 21:57:17 @realDonaldTrump Bump Stocks.? You are blaming Obama for bump stocks.? You should have banned bump Stocks back in November. TOO LITTLE TOO LATE DONNY. Bas AR15 rifles, and clips that hold 30 rounds. universal background checks.  quit lying.  bump stocks.?the least you can do.
3814 2018-03-23 21:57:13 And he can't do it without lying. Obama didn't legalize bump stocks. The ATF tried to ban bump stocks at the time but came to the conclusion that the way the law read, they were gun parts and not firearms.
3815 2018-03-23 21:57:00 There are 196 Countries, and only 1 has banned bump stocks.
3816 2018-03-23 21:56:54 Certainly not. ILGs have outperformed TR v equities over 18 years
3817 2018-03-23 21:56:43 Obama did not legalize bump stocks. You lying again.
3818 2018-03-23 21:56:39 I really like what Trump's doing with the economy, but banning bump stocks is probably more stupid than half of the stuff Obama has done
3819 2018-03-23 21:56:36 Then you’re not watching the market. All of the smart money is pulling out of American stocks.
3820 2018-03-23 21:56:35 This is another of your never ending LIES. 
Because that is ALL you do.
Tell LIE after LIE after LIE .
Bump stocks weren’t legalized. They just weren’t outlawed.

LIAR
3821 2018-03-23 21:56:25 Moron dotard Access Hollywood @POTUS @realDonaldTrump You cannot stop sale of bump stocks by exec order. Must be legislation. Start reading before you continue to do stupid stuff.
3822 2018-03-23 21:56:23 Partially true, very misleading. It was decided under obama that current law could not prohibit bump stocks. Obama signed a bunch of gun restrictions into law which have been repealed by trump including one on mental health and gun access.
3823 2018-03-23 21:56:21 More fool them -without EU controls fishing stocks would be even more depleted
3824 2018-03-23 21:56:16 Why do you insist on being such a dick? Obama didn't legalize bump stocks. Speaking of stocks how about that market? How come we don't hear you bragging about it anymore?
#TrumpCrimeFamily
3825 2018-03-23 21:56:07 Bump stocks are dumb anyway. If you’re actually upset then go buy an Echo Trigger. They do the same thing and liberals don’t know they exist.
3826 2018-03-23 21:56:05 yes, but I had the presence of mind in Oct 2008 to switch my funds to a stability of principal fund instead of stocks and bonds, saved me a bundle.
3827 2018-03-23 21:55:52 If someone that would show you how to use the Google, you would see that the ATF under Obama merely ruled that bump stocks were gun parts and not guns. So, there's that.
3828 2018-03-23 21:55:43 A republican congress kept bump stocks. Trump is lying again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again
3829 2018-03-23 21:55:41 Jeff, you’re so deep in the NRA’s pockets that it flabbergasts me to hear you joke about banning bump stocks.
3830 2018-03-23 21:55:35 Strictly speaking, he’s not advocating a ban on bump stocks.  Because a bump stock has no interaction with the trigger / firing mechanism it’s not a means of converting a semi-auto to fill auto.  On that technical ground the ATF declined to regulate bump stocks.
3831 2018-03-23 21:55:32 You just can't help but to take a positive thing that you've done (probably by accident, but whatever if it gets rid of bump stocks), and twist it into an ego inflating, pompous a$$hole act can you?
3832 2018-03-23 21:55:29 las condiciones favorecen la liquidación de los stocks si los hubiere (se especula con 10 millones de tn), pero el modelo no apunta a eso.
3833 2018-03-23 21:55:24 Obama legalized bump stocks....
Liar
3834 2018-03-23 21:55:22 The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives ruled in 2010 that bump stocks were not a firearm subject to regulation and allowed their sale as an unregulated firearm part. The ATF does not track production, so no one knows how many are in circulation.[2][5]
3835 2018-03-23 21:55:18 Bump Stocks used once and you want to ban it! You can achieve the same result w/ your thumb & a belt loop. Bump stocks DO NOT turn legal weapons into a machine gun, as you still need to pull the trigger for each shot People can actually achieve a high  Cyclic rate W/O accessories
3836 2018-03-23 21:55:16 Little bump in the stocks today eh? Dow weakening. #TrumpStocks.
3837 2018-03-23 21:55:16 Congress... you sit on your power and let this P.O.S. believe he runs DOJ... He believes money is power. Signed b/c stocks Bombs and nukes are his bully pulpit and when he strikes out it is on your hands. #45 knows he has 
 227 days, 19 hours, 8 minutes, 
28 seconds @swingleft
3838 2018-03-23 21:55:10 Bump stocks in and of themselves were not considered a firearm, so were not regulated. The legislation could have been worded better, but Obama did not "legalize" bump stocks. But keep drinking that NRA KoolAid, Mr. President.
3839 2018-03-23 21:54:59 When did they ‘legalize’ bump stocks?
If you mean that prior administration‘s did not have the ATF outlaw them then that is a different sentence. 
But blaming the former AWESOME President @BarackObama or doing something he didn’t is just another one of your never ending lies.
3840 2018-03-23 21:54:58 I remember watching you with many Parkland teens, families and others tell us you were going to ban bump stocks; raise age to purchase and expand background checks. You can’t make any of this happen, can you?
I didn’t believe you anyway.
3841 2018-03-23 21:54:52 Obama didn’t legalized anything. Obama was president and not Congress. Bump stocks are accessories that don’t violate any laws at all. Are you going to ban fingers, or belt loops too? You can do the same thing a bump stock does with a belt loop and fingers.
3842 2018-03-23 21:54:24 Well bump stocks,  it's been fun.  I'm sure gonna miss riding that crazy train.
3843 2018-03-23 21:54:21 Oh shut up Donny. Only thing you're worried about is your stocks getting a bump
3844 2018-03-23 21:54:18 The Left: YOU CAN’T TAKE OUR BUMP STOCKS...even tho we want to ban guns...but we still need bump stocks...Trump’s racist...Stormy Daniels...
3845 2018-03-23 21:54:17 Doesn't make sense Mr @POTUS. We all know that Bump Stocks has nothing to do with modifications by those in the know. We know that arrogant @SenSchumer chuck the schmuck is gloating & looking stupid over this. They really want a disarmament of all Americans if had their way.
3846 2018-03-23 21:54:14 WH banning bump stocks is more smoke and mirrors. Expensive law suits, which some NRA member will win. And congress can avoid the vote.
3847 2018-03-23 21:54:07 Holy shit. You are the worst excuse for a human EVER! Why are you obsessed with Obama and HRC? You should have banned bump stocks after Vegas. Stop tooting your horn and act like the damn president. #WorstPresidentEver #ResignAlready #LockHimUp #YoullNeverBeAsGoodAsObama
3848 2018-03-23 21:53:42 ok but your words were “read the second amendment”. if i read it, it will not say “the right to own bump stocks”
3849 2018-03-23 21:53:25 Bump stocks do not turn a gun into a full auto. Who is advising you? Pelosie? You need advisors who know what they are talking about.
3850 2018-03-23 21:53:18 Trump supporters have to be the dumbest people. Bump stocks were legal way before Obama but you idiots will believe Trump
3851 2018-03-23 21:53:16 Another series of lies. Obama did not legalize bump stocks. Any gun regulation he brought forth was nixed by GOP. You couldn't care less and are hoping for another 30 million from the NRA. You are VERY concerned that a bunch of kids will make the GOP lose in 2018.
3852 2018-03-23 21:53:15 Can you, or any of your idiot followers, please point out the EXACT BILL, signed by President Obama, legalizing bump stocks? I'll wait. When you realize it doesn't exist, you may want to re-read the definition of "Libel" and be happy Mr. Obama isn't litigious.
3853 2018-03-23 21:53:07 Yeah, cause nothings says law abiding like bump stocks!
3854 2018-03-23 21:53:01 Typical Trump fake / misleading statement. There is no way you could call the rule no by ATF an approval. And, banning bump stocks does very, very little to prevent gun violence.
3855 2018-03-23 21:52:58 Bump stocks weren't used in Parkland, apparently you can't even pay attention to mass killing of kids!
3856 2018-03-23 21:52:51 Lol Obama didn't legalize bump stocks. Bump stocks have been a thing for about 20 years. They just haven't been regulated until now.
3857 2018-03-23 21:52:49 #littlelyingdonny Obama Administration did NOT legalize bump stocks. Republican bullshit tied their hands.

3859 2018-03-23 21:52:42 Talking about the wrong stocks Mrs, President. Stocks Down Down Down!!!!
3860 2018-03-23 21:52:41 It does not matter what he does today at this point.

Trump - "Hey guys, I banned bump stocks" ... 

Conservatives - "Great, by the way, is it hot under Paul Ryan's desk?
3861 2018-03-23 21:52:35 Evil people with bump stocks....
3862 2018-03-23 21:52:34 What if we already have bump stocks? Is somebody gonna go house to house
3863 2018-03-23 21:52:26 yes but not the lowest of the one which is on it's way. pray for your stocks old men
3864 2018-03-23 21:52:24 Bump Stocks make "bump shooting" easier and safer for other folks at the firing line.  They are not necessary to "bump shoot."  Banning them only makes honest citizens "Criminals" at the stroke of a pen.  Bump Stocks are tools to make "bump shooting" SAFER.
3865 2018-03-23 21:52:16 Fuck you! Bump stocks do not make it a machine gun. A machine gun will fire the entire ammo reserve with a single trigger pull. The bumpstock is still individual trigger pulls per bullet.
3866 2018-03-23 21:52:14 And, as usual, he’s factually incorrect. Bump stocks were already a thing before Obama was ever elected.
3867 2018-03-23 21:52:14 So we don't get a wall but we get bump stocks outlawed. Is that the Art of the Deal?
3868 2018-03-23 21:52:08 No matter how you see it, was not a good day/week for Longs... A lot of beating on almost every name...

3869 2018-03-23 21:51:56 Banning bump stocks isn't going to prevent mass shootings, you inept imbecile.
3870 2018-03-23 21:51:45 Pussy grabbing and porn stars and Russia and meting with North Korea and walls but bump stocks cross the line?
3871 2018-03-23 21:51:40 Seriously? You’re comparing bump stocks to a woman’s right to choose? But then, you’re a man...
3872 2018-03-23 21:51:37 @TheReal666  Hey can you please follow me back so i can DM you a q! Thanks
3873 2018-03-23 21:51:31 LIAR.  The ATF determined it had no legal authority to regulate bump stocks.  Congress failed to act.  And you sir have rolled back many Obama era regulations on firearms where there WAS legal authority to act.  #FakeTweet
3874 2018-03-23 21:51:20 I don't mean to detract from something good. Banning bump stocks is good. Good job. Do you think you could tell us about it without telling a lie in the same breath?
3875 2018-03-23 21:51:17 Bump stocks amplify an existing problem
3876 2018-03-23 21:51:10 LIAR! NO!  Obama DID NOT legalize bump stocks. The law simply did not allow Obama to prohibit bump stocks.  If congress wanted to regulate them they could have.  President Trump is WRONG! Bump stocks weren't considered an issue until after the Vegas shootings.
3877 2018-03-23 21:51:06 3weeks nalang before matapos yung term pero yung stocks ko di parin tumataas
3878 2018-03-23 21:51:00 Nice try, Liar-In-Chief, but Obama didn't legalize bump stocks.
3879 2018-03-23 21:50:56 As usual you are distorting facts to fit your fantasy. Obama did NOT legalise bump stocks but found that existing laws didn't prohibit. #GOP blocked all gun control & YOU reversed his Exec Orders. Try to utter 1 truthful statement a day-it might B habit forming #ImpeachTrumpNow
3880 2018-03-23 21:50:56 TFW Obama had the sense to know bump stocks are a meme, but Trump doesn't.
3881 2018-03-23 21:50:55 The Las Vegas massacre was a deep state false flag event for the eventual banning of bump stocks.  That was highly successful.  Bump stocks would only be useful in an all out war on US soil, where AR-15's would operate as military rifles in a battle against Armegeddon.
3882 2018-03-23 21:50:48 Trump is a habitual liar! He just makes shit up as he goes. The Vegas shooting happened under his watch & he still cannot put the timeline of events regarding bump stocks in perspective. Trump has no credibility worldwide. Those who don’t see this are fools.
3883 2018-03-23 21:50:37 False. False. False. Obama didn’t legalize bump stocks. Your obsession with him is unhealthy. Seek counseling.
3884 2018-03-23 21:50:35 It was a ruling that the "current law did not allow for it's regulation."  When people say you lie, this is why. Obama did not legalize bump stocks. Know your facts....or maybe you do and lie anyway.
3885 2018-03-23 21:50:31 Bit he's going down the gun control rabbit hole as well with the ban on bump stocks and leaving it open-ended.
3886 2018-03-23 21:50:26 Banning bump stocks won't change a guns ability.
3887 2018-03-23 21:50:20 What the actual.... Seriously? Bump stocks were never "legalized". They were invented. And they hadn't entered the public eye until people were killed by them. This just in, Obama legalized breathing. Terrible idea!
3888 2018-03-23 21:50:16 You are not very versed on much sir. Bump stocks did not come into play until Last Vegas. Please stop misinforming people. I know your life is a lie but the rest of us citizens are good people unlike you and we do not appreciate constant deception from you.
3889 2018-03-23 21:50:11 Bump Stocks are useless
3890 2018-03-23 21:50:09 As soon as the regs are adopted, the NRA will challenge them, and they won’t take effect.  With their posturing, Trump and Sessions are actually ensuring that bump stocks will remain legal for the foreseeable future.
3891 2018-03-23 21:50:03 Bump stocks are a red herring you can get the same effect by hooking your regular stock through your belt loop or windbreaker the one they really need to ban are binary triggers but you dumb asses are just thinking about bump stocks
3892 2018-03-23 21:50:02 What a waste of time...Bump stocks don't kill people.  Evil does.
3893 2018-03-23 21:50:01 Mr. President, banning bump stocks is a feel-good measure that won’t affect crime at all. It just feeds the liberals’ thirst for more regulation of guns.
3894 2018-03-23 21:49:59 And lied again about @BarackObama legalizing bump stocks #liarinchief
3895 2018-03-23 21:49:57 ...Yes bump stocks are bad...killing machines that should be banned. Donnie, speaking of bumping stocks...Your trade war is a bad idea for America First. In the end jobs will be lost, relationships will be diminished, and consumers will pay for it in the end!
3896 2018-03-23 21:49:41 Bump stocks don’t kill people,assault rifles do.
3897 2018-03-23 21:49:38 Let's see if I understand the game plan here: trump bans bump stocks by executive order (& becomes a hero!), the government gets sued and loses (because legislation is actually needed). Congress does nothing. NRA and trump give each other high-fives. Everything stays the same,
3898 2018-03-23 21:49:35 .Can't you stop lying for even one lousy tweet? The 2010 finding by the ATF didn't "approve" bump stocks. The admin was handcuffed by laws favorable to the gun industry and determined that it could not legally ban them. If you can't tell the truth, try shutting up for once.
3899 2018-03-23 21:49:28 Bump Stocks have just become gold. Prices are rising astronomically.
3900 2018-03-23 21:49:27 This guy is supposed to be leading us and he can’t even get the facts right about damn bump stocks! It’s simple. He’s a compulsive liar. You can’t believe a word he says. Period.
3901 2018-03-23 21:49:25 My family , we a team together we worth bank hoeeeee stocks and fucking  bonds. 
3902 2018-03-23 21:49:24 wouldn't it cause marches from those who want bump stocks? I don't really care as long as my rifle can have a stock.
3903 2018-03-23 21:49:16 I invested in stocks for the first time today, feel like I just changed my life lmfao
3904 2018-03-23 21:49:14 Increased $WFC to 8% of single stocks. 45% of singles fall in Morningstar's Value style box (min. target: 43%). Cash is 8% of assets (target: 8%).
3905 2018-03-23 21:49:12 This is ridiculous. Aside from your deceptive claim that the Obama Administration legalized bump stocks, this measure doesn't address the legal weapons that are already "machine guns"...rapid fire assault rifles! Ban all those weapons and raise the age to buy guns to 21.
3906 2018-03-23 21:49:10 I don’t want to hear about bump stocks!! You are breaking your promises & betraying our trust!
3907 2018-03-23 21:49:04 No one cares about bump stocks u have let me down.. u r now part of the swamp!
3908 2018-03-23 21:48:52 These headlines are NOT from @TheOnion : 

Trump reverses Obama-era rule to ban bump stocks
ADMINISTRATION
 — 9M 6S AGO
Pa. school district stocks classrooms with rocks to combat school shooters
STATE WATCH
 — 20M 42S AGO
3909 2018-03-23 21:48:46 Oh and he walked on the 2nd amendment. Banned bump stocks. Granted I don’t want or need one. But is that really the point?? Spending like a dem. Anti 2nd like a dem. Am I missing something here?? And Killary is still walking around.....
3910 2018-03-23 21:48:32 Bump stocks are the least of your worries. You have now guaranteed a Democrat majority in 2018 election.
3911 2018-03-23 21:48:23 Gun control in spending bill just passed. Trump is banning bump stocks. Research into gun violence on again. All of this since Parkland.
3912 2018-03-23 21:48:19 Did trump sell stocks just before he did this, knowing stocks would drop. If his actions caused the drop, then he knew what was coming. Illegal???
3913 2018-03-23 21:48:18 So @realDonaldTrump is quick to share his concerns on bump stocks, but has nothing to say as another UNARMED black man #StephonClark was shot by the police?
3914 2018-03-23 21:48:09 Obama admin. did  not legalize bump stocks.  And big fat whoop...should not have taken this long to do so little.
3915 2018-03-23 21:48:02 Obama did not legalize bump stocks but could not prevent their sale because of current law, but whatever. If you can ban them, good! Thank you.
3916 2018-03-23 21:48:00 Obama didn't legalize bump stocks
3917 2018-03-23 21:47:58 & Obama did not allow bump stocks. He could not stop it. Get it right. #FakeNews
3918 2018-03-23 21:47:48 I plan on buying a bunch of Facebook on Monday in individual stocks. 2 billion users. This is a temporary dip
3919 2018-03-23 21:47:46 It’s not that we don’t trust you, oh right...we don’t trust you. 
We need Congress to act & we’re not giving up. You and the NRA are wrong to think bump stocks are a bargaining chip. We want all weapons of war off the streets!
3920 2018-03-23 21:47:45 Should trade bump stocks for derestricting suppressors. Art of the deal and all
3921 2018-03-23 21:47:38 I don't Like Bump Stocks Myself, Kinda Stupid, and kinda Dangerous... BUT  In My Life the words #ShallNotBeInfringed  Still have a very Strong Meaning...
3922 2018-03-23 21:47:38 Bump stocks do not turn weapons into machine guns and you know it.  Today, you've lost an ardent supporter.  I think I'm going to register as a Libertarian.
3923 2018-03-23 21:47:38 Obama didn’t “legalize” bump stocks, they simply weren’t outlawed under his administration.  I can also bump fire a rifle using the jeans I’m currently wearing, so this isn’t some milestone accomplishment.
3924 2018-03-23 21:47:35 Let's Fact Check Drumpf's Last Tweet: 

Obama did not approve Bump Stocks.  His administration simply found that the current LAWS did not prohibit them.

Obama tried for gun control but the GOP pushed back every time

Not stop your BLATANT lies! 

#ImpeachTrump
3925 2018-03-23 21:47:33 Well there are a few reasons, for the sake of brevity I will keep my arguments to specifically bump stocks and not 'things that increase rate of fire.'  Bump stocks are a component of the gun that isn't mechanically hard to reproduce, you could literally make one with wood >>
3926 2018-03-23 21:47:18 Obama was taking everyone's guns away so bump stocks were useless
3927 2018-03-23 21:47:17 The Justice Department is proposing rule changes that will effectively ban bump stocks, devices that allow semi-automatic weapons to fire like a machine gun, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said on Friday.
3928 2018-03-23 21:47:16 What do you think of our presidents tweet about making bump stocks illegal?
3929 2018-03-23 21:46:54 Legal weapons should be illegal, who needs a semi-automatic AR15 with rapid fire; even without bump stocks, a deranged could easily kill many before police arrives, BAN ALL military style weapons, if not, young adults will ban @NRA & loose the $30 Million they contributed 2 Trump
3930 2018-03-23 21:46:52 @pickoftheday1 @ShortSqueezed1 @CarsPerforming @CarsPerforming @WishfulTH1NKin @EnhancedInvest @MedX_Holdings @
3931 2018-03-23 21:46:51 The ATF has evaluated bumpfire and slide fire stocks multiple times and found that they do not meet the criteria of creating a machine gun. This is why people who don’t know anything about firearms should not be making the laws about firearms.
3932 2018-03-23 21:46:51 Banning bump stocks may be something but it hardly makes a dent in what needs to be done. Also explicitly sayin that Obama legalized it is misleading at best. But misleading your followers and blaming others is what you do best.
3933 2018-03-23 21:46:43 Bump stocks DO NOT turn semi-automatic rifles into machine guns.
3934 2018-03-23 21:46:43 Bump stocks must be banned. However, my understanding is that the Justice department doesn’t have the power to do that. We need a law from Congress or this effort will fail...that’s not your plan, is it? ...to waste time on a plan that’s designed to fail?
3935 2018-03-23 21:46:33 I don't give a fuck about the bump stocks. Why did you sign that horrendous bill?
3936 2018-03-23 21:46:22 Bump stocks are nothing. First we get cornholed with Bolton, Bush family best friend neocon war starter, then we get an insane budget increase biggest pork to the left in history now we’ve got shooting range gimmick ‘bumpstock’ ban nonsense this isn’t what I voted for.
3937 2018-03-23 21:46:21 NO!  Obama DID NOT legalize bump stocks.  The law did not allow Obama to prohibit bump stocks.  If congress wanted to regulate them they could have.  You’re WRONG AGAIN! Bump stocks weren't considered an issue until after the Vegas shootings.  STOP LYING!
3938 2018-03-23 21:46:18 I thought you said the Dems wanted to take guns away?
Now you're saying they approved bump stocks.
Is there any truth somewhere in the middle?
3939 2018-03-23 21:46:15 investing in stocks 
3940 2018-03-23 21:46:15 The Obama administration didn’t legalize bump stocks, the laws just didn’t allow them to prohibit them.
3941 2018-03-23 21:46:13 Your masters at the NRA fed you this BS because they know you are trying to get rid of anything Obama ever did. They need you to get rid of bump stocks because it's the way you and the NRA can pretend you "did something" without actually doing anything.
3942 2018-03-23 21:46:08 Bump stocks are a tool used for bumd fire, a technique that can be done mutliple ways, even without and special device such as bumpstocks. Just a stupid ban for anyone who knows ANYTHING about guns.
3943 2018-03-23 21:45:57 well if I choose not to vote for him next time it's not because of bump stocks I don't see the point to have them it'll be because
3944 2018-03-23 21:45:56 @realDonaldTrump   It won’t help, bump stocks are not the problem. Signing that crap Bill today, probably gives Pelosi back her speakership. And everything you have done will be undone. I am so very disappointed. PP gets $$$ so wrong.
3945 2018-03-23 21:45:45 I think the wording that Obama approved bump stocks is purposely misleading. Rather the law did not allow ATF the power to ban it.
3946 2018-03-23 21:45:42 He just baned so called bump stocks , he promised to protect the 2nd amendment , sorry but so far today has been a very bad day, this is not how you keep your base by breaking your promises .
3947 2018-03-23 21:45:34 We don't care about bump stocks, we care because it is a concession that has absolutely no benefit. Half of Dems want a total gun ban and thats only going to grow, any concession we make is one less roadblock for them.
3948 2018-03-23 21:45:27 As usual, you misrepresented the facts. Obama adm did not legalize bump stocks. They could not delegalize them in accordance w/the then current law. It is good  to ban bump stocks, but much better to ban assault weapons for ordinary folks.
3949 2018-03-23 21:45:19 NOBODY “legalized” bump stocks Dr. Fantasy. But the record shows that the NRA and their Republican lackeys in Congress blocked proposed legislation to ban them twice.
3950 2018-03-23 21:45:13 People spend the coupon on bonds. Should we ignore the yield on gilts?
3951 2018-03-23 21:45:09 @rickcatino Obama legalized bump stocks?  LMAO . Donald, even your Trumpkins can’t believe that... well, maybe they would given they seem to believe most of your lies. Massachusetts made bump stocks illegal six months ago. Good to see you are FINALLY getting around to it...
3952 2018-03-23 21:45:01 Wrong again Donnie!  Bump stocks could not be legally regulated during Obama’s administration. He implemented stricter gun laws......oh yeah, that you rolled back. Try again loser!
3953 2018-03-23 21:44:58 Question is, did Trump sell stocks just before he imposed those tariffs, knowing it would have an immediate and profound effect on the Dow Jones? How could that be legal. I think people have been jailed for that kind of thing, haven’t they?
3954 2018-03-23 21:44:58 There he goes again ORANGE MAN blaming the black man for legalizing bump stocks that he DIDN'T!! More lies from the LIAR IN CHIEF
3955 2018-03-23 21:44:40 Fifty-eight people died in the Las Vegas Terrorist Attack. The American Terrorist used a Bump Stock to convert his semi-automatic into an automatic rifle. Bump Stocks are STILL LEGAL because the NRA opposes restrictions on them. The GOP Congress is impotent. #MarchForOurLives
3956 2018-03-23 21:44:29 Bump stocks, great. Meanwhile, babies are being aborted, illegals are living off the government teat, our veterans are not being cared for, and no wall is being funded. Excuse me if I’m less than thrilled about bump stocks.
3957 2018-03-23 21:44:23 I'll share this sentiment. I have an AR and couldn't give a shit less about bump stocks one way or the other. But I am concerned about Bush/Obama like spending. Rolling over for Chuck & Nancy w/o a fight. MAGA my ass. More go along to get along.
3958 2018-03-23 21:44:18 Ban assault rifles. Don’t stop at bump stocks.
3959 2018-03-23 21:44:17 Obama did not "legalize bump stocks". The ATF approved some applications from manufacturers to make bump stocks because the devices were not against any existing laws. Congress makes the laws, not the President.
3960 2018-03-23 21:44:15 Constitution don't say shit about bump stocks.
3961 2018-03-23 21:44:13 And how about all the auto-assault Weapons not requiring bump stocks because already machine guns?!?!
3962 2018-03-23 21:44:13 Only Congress can ban bump stocks you liar.
3963 2018-03-23 21:44:09 Obama, Obama! Just behave like a grown up. Bump Stocks were suppose to go after Vegas. We are onto Assault weapons now.
3964 2018-03-23 21:44:08 Truly a sad day for the second amendment. You have no clue what you are talking about Don. ATF declared bump stocks legal because they don't change the functiom of the firearm. You sir will not get my vote in 2020 if you keep down this path.
3965 2018-03-23 21:43:59 how many people do you think care about bump stocks ...  besides the sellers who are now unemployed? you did not campaign to make bump stocks illegal ... you PROMISED "THERE WILL BE NO AMNESTY" ... so QUIT LOBBYING CONGRESS FOR A #Daca #Amnesty or most #Conservatives be gone bye
3966 2018-03-23 21:43:27 Yeah Bump Stocks are a joke, but leave legal weapons alone. PROTECT 2nd Amendment!
After signing #OmniWreck today can we Trust?
NOT BLINDLY!
3967 2018-03-23 21:43:26 That’s false. The Obama administration determine that current law did not permit them to ban bump stocks. Big difference.
3968 2018-03-23 21:43:18 Sarah Huckbee Sander’s statement on volatility in stock market, “The president has a mission to make stocks more affordable for everyday Americans.” #MarchSadness
3969 2018-03-23 21:43:16 more bullshit! Obama administration did not legalized bump stocks.
3970 2018-03-23 21:43:13 Bump stocks are just a gimmick toy and I don't care,,, but come for the guns, expect a war
3971 2018-03-23 21:43:10 The Obama Administration did not legalize bump stocks. They were already being sold before he came into office. You lie as easy as you breathe. #TrumpLies
3972 2018-03-23 21:43:05 Trump administration bans bump stocks, 'all devices' that turn 'legal' weapons into machine guns
3973 2018-03-23 21:43:02 @POTUS @WhiteHouse @PressSec The Obama Admin did not "legalize" bump stocks. It was determined that under the current gun laws that they could not be legally regulated. If You and Congress would grow a pair & defy the NRA you could change those laws so such devices ARE regulated
3974 2018-03-23 21:42:57 I'm more against the potential age restrictions on firearms (mostly for legal adults) than I am against making bump stocks illegal
3975 2018-03-23 21:42:55 You just cannot stop lying. To those that care about the truth- the ATF determined that bump stocks were not prohibited by the current firearms law. They did not “legalize” bumpstocks. Your obsession with Obama is SAD! 
3976 2018-03-23 21:42:48 Another Trump lie. Obama did not legalize bump stocks. GOP turned down his proposed ban. Lying bastard Trump. Go golfing again you prick.
3977 2018-03-23 21:42:35 evil people with bump stocks are a bigger problem
3978 2018-03-23 21:42:31 You are starting to scare me i really see some wavering from you in issue of guns bump stocks are not the problem people are i have supported this adminstration however bump stocks today my 30 06 deer rifle tommorrow not good
3979 2018-03-23 21:42:23 Bump stocks don't kill people. People kill people.
3980 2018-03-23 21:42:22 are you gonna make belt loops illegal too, I can do the same thing as a bump stock with my belt loop? Bump stocks don't turn guns into machine guns. It's still one shot per trigger pull, with or without a bump stock. You should learn what it is before you ban it!
3981 2018-03-23 21:42:18 Lying Donald is at it again. The Obama Administration determined that it was unable to ban bump stocks due to the ATF's determination that the firearm regulations didn't apply to bump stocks, so ATF reluctantly did not ban the their sale.
3982 2018-03-23 21:42:12 Who gives a Damn about bump stocks you just screwed the American people

 You're a good Democrat give a tax cut then take it away with the tariff then escalate spending
3983 2018-03-23 21:42:06 Over how many 18year periods in the last 100 years has free fallen. ? This is a story
3984 2018-03-23 21:41:56 Going to be great when the bump stocks prohibition is overturned and Congress doesn’t ban them legislatively but at least you tried.
3985 2018-03-23 21:41:55 You are a first class imbecile- this issue doesn't help matters-what happens to all the bump stocks that are in circulation than too what about all guns period.There's no such thing as gun control.
3986 2018-03-23 21:41:55 Don’t care about Bump stocks or the “Dreamers “. Build the WALL!
3987 2018-03-23 21:41:37 No, the Obama Admin didn't "legalize" bump stocks. However, YOU reversed an Obama measure preventing people with mental illness from buying guns. BAD IDEA is an understatement. And as long as weapons of war are "legal weapons," your bump stock ban is a band-aid on a bullet wound.
3988 2018-03-23 21:41:36 Dacia has to get solved doesn’t it and are you in favour of bump stocks, Mike. Remember he is swimming in a deep thick swamp . He has to use strategy when draining this mess
3989 2018-03-23 21:41:31 Yes. Bump stocks after this shooting. Then the next? Semi-Autos because who needs them? Then handguns because they are used in the most crimes, then bolt actions because they look like sniper rifles?
3990 2018-03-23 21:41:29 I dont think criminals will say "hey, bump stocks are illegal, so i wont use it on my illegal gun".
3991 2018-03-23 21:41:20 $MU Usually when stocks have 95 percent bullishness on StockTwits, they sell off no matter what the earnings.
3992 2018-03-23 21:41:15 I find it beneficial not to check the performance of my stocks everyday, or every week, for that matter. This makes it easier to keep a long-term focus.
3993 2018-03-23 21:41:08 I agree here. Bump stocks aren't essential to protect our life and liberty.  Voters can make sound judgements to keep #2a without bump stocks.
3994 2018-03-23 21:40:57 Far more people are murdered through abortion each year, yet we just funded Planned Parenthood again. For those that are ok with abortion, the government still shouldn't  be financing an elective procedure for irresponsible, selfish people! How could bump stocks be the priority?
3995 2018-03-23 21:40:57 Word, my friend. Bump stocks are the least of his worries right now. His advisors are sorely failing him.
3996 2018-03-23 21:40:56 Bump stocks is crumbs.
3997 2018-03-23 21:40:54 I agree with you Mr. Payne.  I am holding and looking for 2018 in stocks.
3998 2018-03-23 21:40:49 Well, no offense, Mr President. But you promised to put the gov back in our hands and today, with this bill, you gave it back to the swamp...Hope you have some countermeasure to right this horrible bill. Also, the gun grabbers won't stop at banning the "evil" bump stocks..
3999 2018-03-23 21:40:48 What price (USD) will bitcoin hit this weekend?                                                 #bitcoin #btc #ltc #eth #ethereum #litecoin #Zcash #ada #iota #xlm #xrp #Dash #XEM #XMR #Binance #NEM #verge #tron #trx #xvg #crypto #stocks #cryptocurrency #BTCUSD #invest #money
4000 2018-03-23 21:40:47 That is actually a FALSE statement , the Obama admin did not make bump stocks legal. They were never illegal , they are a part and were never regulated at all. So NO Obama did NOT legalize bump stocks. Dumb donny blames anything on Obama.
4001 2018-03-23 21:40:46 Think the GOP blocked him banging bump stocks
4002 2018-03-23 21:40:45 Nice try... you only banned the sale of bump stocks. You know how easy it is to make one?
4003 2018-03-23 21:40:42 Nobody wonders about all the lies of 45 anymore...the topic is sad enough though. Way too many guns around, with or without bump stocks!!!
4004 2018-03-23 21:40:32 You obviously don’t understand that bump stocks can’t turn ANY gun into a “machine gun”.
4005 2018-03-23 21:40:21 What else? “We want a ban on bump stocks and high-capacity magazines and to have universal background checks."
4006 2018-03-23 21:40:17 Of course people spend dividends
4007 2018-03-23 21:40:17 You believe everything he says. Fact check the lie about Obama & bump stocks.
4008 2018-03-23 21:40:10 How do you know that someone is a law abiding citizen and does not have other agendas when buying bump stocks or guns?
4009 2018-03-23 21:40:10 Once again, Trump doesn't understand what goes on. Obama Administration didn't legalize bump stocks. The ATF reviewed bump stocks to determine if they comply with laws or not. They determined they complied. It was and still is up to congress to change the laws.
4010 2018-03-23 21:39:58 These decisions allowed two companies to sell bump stocks. It’s important to note this was not a statement of Obama’s preferred policy, which called for more regulation of guns, but was what the agency determined it had to do under the language of current law.
4011 2018-03-23 21:39:43 And yet today on the television he said the stocks were the best since he took office.
4012 2018-03-23 21:39:37 Obama didn't "legalize" bump stocks. The law at that time did not permit regulation on bump stocks. It was a technicality. Stop lying, you piece of shit.
4013 2018-03-23 21:39:36 No. The Obama admin did not “ legalize” bumpstocks. They were simply manufactured and sold. This whole tweet is a silly diversion of scapegoating to alleviate yourself of decisive action that could loose your NRA support. Even you said you weren’t even aware of bump stocks.
4014 2018-03-23 21:39:32 Did not liar. Bump stocks are the consession? Bullshit. AR-15’s. That’s what we’re talking about. Why does obama have so many more followers then you? Here’s a hint, because you suck!
4015 2018-03-23 21:39:32 Obama admin. did not legalize Bump Stocks....ATF deemed under current laws, that it was a legal device.
4016 2018-03-23 21:39:16 Least possible impact on gun safety!

 #TrumpNRAPuppet

RT @CarolHLN: #URGENT - DOJ announces rule change to ban bumps stocks
4017 2018-03-23 21:39:15 @realDonaldTrump No one cares about bump stocks, you think that is going to distract from the BS you just signed into law then used the military as an excuse to not have to fight the democrats and stand up for america and put america first. You JUST MALA Made American Last Again
4018 2018-03-23 21:39:14 OBAMA NEVER OKed bump stocks. FACT CHECK PLEASE.
4019 2018-03-23 21:39:13 What do you need bump stocks for, you want to do harm to others. Yes ban them, and while your at it band AK's. Military Assault weapons. The public doesn't need them. Go hunt bamby with a shot gun.
4020 2018-03-23 21:39:11 weak market. W/stocks that  move 2-3x t market in either direction its prudent for intermediate term investors to hold cash
4021 2018-03-23 21:39:09 No he didn't legalize bump stocks! He didn't invent them either but your buddies in the NRA made sure congress wouldn't do a thing to outlaw them. Btw, DOJ can't make up their own laws either.
4022 2018-03-23 21:39:07 The Wall Street Journal reports that the specific securities being investigated are pharmaceutical stocks. #Management
4023 2018-03-23 21:39:02 Bill Potus also promised to protect the 2nd amendment But just a little while ago he came out attacking it . With his ban on so called bump stocks . This is not the way to win his base back.
4024 2018-03-23 21:39:01 Why is Trump so adamantly against bump stocks? As determined as he is to ban them, you’d think a bump stock murdered his whole family.
4025 2018-03-23 21:38:57 What has killed more people? Bump stocks or @PPFA ? Defund this demonic organization!
4026 2018-03-23 21:38:56 You know since Trump killed the DOW with the tariffs. People should look into whether he sold off a lot of stocks just before he signed that deal. That can’t be legal???
4027 2018-03-23 21:38:54 People are getting mad at Trump for wanting to ban bump stocks, saying it violates the 2nd amendment... aside from the 2nd amendment having nothing to do with bump stocks, they serve no helpful use.
4028 2018-03-23 21:38:54 And here I thought you were going to defend the second amendment. Please educate yourself as it's clear you don't even know what bump stocks are.
4029 2018-03-23 21:38:46 Rough couple of days for Team Trump:

-Bolton as NatSec Advisor

-Massive spending budget that no one had time to read signed

-President talking gun control 

-Sanctions on China and Beijing's response to steel tariffs cause stocks to plummet

#TGIF
4030 2018-03-23 21:38:44 Then you have to redefine AR-15s as machine guns because that is what the bump stocks go on.
4031 2018-03-23 21:38:39 Nope, his administration (ATF) determined they couldn't regulate them because they weren't firearms. You know damn well Pres. Obama tried to have stronger gun regulations, which YOU are rolling back. Good on banning bump stocks but stop lying about Obama. #LiarinChief
4032 2018-03-23 21:38:34 ok, ...I mean I agree. Don't like seeing gun control but Bump Stocks are a stupid thing to begin with, and they're trying to by-pass weapons permitting laws&rules. Warm on this, not Hot or Freezing. ... Anyway, You have a Great Weekend Sir!!!!
4033 2018-03-23 21:38:14 The Obama Admn did not legalize bump stocks.
4034 2018-03-23 21:38:12 President Trump says his administration will "BAN" bump stock devices that "turn legal weapons into illegal machines." as Justice Dept begins process to amend federal firearms regulations to clarify that federal law defines bump stocks as machine guns.
4035 2018-03-23 21:38:11 1. Banning bump stocks will not stop people for illegally nodding their rifle. 
2. Machine guns shouldn't be illegal
4036 2018-03-23 21:38:09 Trump signed the omnibus, Sessions is acting on bump stocks. Bad week for "centipedes" even without all the Russia and Cambridge news 
4037 2018-03-23 21:38:05 Gun control: US justice department moves to ban rapid-fire bump stocks | guardian
4038 2018-03-23 21:38:03 Tell that to the families of those killed or the people injured in the Las Vegas shooting where a law abiding person (now known to be a monster) with no known mental health issues LEGALLY bought 15+ AR15's and 15+ bump stocks and killed 60 injured 500+ #GunControlNow #NeverAgain
4039 2018-03-23 21:38:03 No, they did not. You & the #nra talking points are wrong. Under the law at the time, they could not ban certain bump stocks but did ban others. You lie like you breathe.
4040 2018-03-23 21:37:58 LIAR. WRONG AS USUAL. The problem was not with the Obama Administration, it was with the law that prevented the Administration from banning bump stocks-because a bump stock is a FIREARM PART and is not regulated as a firearm under the Gun Control Act or National Firearms Act.
4041 2018-03-23 21:37:40 Swamp Meets coming from Mexico all year long! Cartels have never been out of business but this is a free pass if i ever seen one.  By the way, even a half ass machinist can make Bump Stocks. I'm more concern about these Governors passing gun laws unconstitutionally.
4042 2018-03-23 21:37:29 I wonder why nobody seemed to tell me nice call on some stocks I recommended a few months back. I will soon start an active trading platform and will help people manage an active stock and crypto fund.
4043 2018-03-23 21:37:28 BREAKING: The Department of Justice has issued proposals to change the regulations that would effectively ban bump stocks. This begins a 90 day public comment period and is another step towards a final decision.
4044 2018-03-23 21:37:23 Both you and trump are wrong. Bump fire stocks were ruled legal by the BATF. Nothing to do with obama or congress.
4045 2018-03-23 21:37:22 So now you're for gun control.
Maybe instead of banning bump stocks we should ban the guns that go in them, but progress is progress.
Or this is just an attempt to get the liberals to shut up about gun control.
4046 2018-03-23 21:37:21 More lies being babbled by the madman. President Obama never legalized bump stocks. Mr. Mueller has your peanut sized balls in a vice & he's going to crush them along with all your hopes & dreams you had for yourself & your hoodrat kids. When is Jared & Ivanka going to be fired?
4047 2018-03-23 21:37:02 There was no bill, no approval. Merely a ruling by ATF that bump stocks weren’t covered by existing restrictions
4048 2018-03-23 21:37:01 Trump just accused Obama of legalizing bump stocks which was a flat out lie.  They did not legalized them, but the law did not allow them to ban them.
4049 2018-03-23 21:37:00 Should’ve said no!! Your job just got even harder. Bump stocks we’re the least of our worry. H-1, border wall, sanctuary cities, American jobs, American security we’re our concern.  Sold out, and totally scr$&@d!! Should have let them shut down. YUGE win for Dems!! Bad, bad!!
4050 2018-03-23 21:36:57 Obama did not "legalize" bump stocks: the ATF during Obama simply determined that they were not illegal under the restrictions at the time. No reasonable person should blame Obama for not starting a pissing match with the NRA over this with the social climate like it was.
4051 2018-03-23 21:36:52 NO!  Obama DID NOT legalize bump stocks. The law simply did not allow Obama to prohibit bump stocks.  If congress wanted to regulate them they could have. t-Rump is WRONG! Bump stocks weren't considered an issue until after the Vegas shootings.
4052 2018-03-23 21:36:52 I've craved sweets my entire pregnancy so I turned to juice and I think I've made ocean sprays sea and stocks like boom for the past nine months #SorryNotSorry
4053 2018-03-23 21:36:50 Wrong, as usual. The Obama Administration did not legalize bump stocks. Bump stocks were described by the ATF in 2010 as "a firearm part" and as such not regulated as a firearm under the Gun Control Act or the National Firearms Act.
4054 2018-03-23 21:36:44 95% of people buy/sell stocks to make more money, so what's the deal?
4055 2018-03-23 21:36:35 Bump stocks and guns are not the problem.
4056 2018-03-23 21:36:27 because bump stocks?
4057 2018-03-23 21:36:26 Obama did not legalize bump stocks. Your tweet just shows what everyone already knows. You're a sociopath! You blame everyone but yourself.
4058 2018-03-23 21:36:26 Trump picking the same day to announce the proposed banning of bump stocks after the Omnibus dumpster fire assures a Democrat sweep in November and a one and done POTUS term.
4059 2018-03-23 21:36:21 OMG Mr. President, go talk to your sons about firearms, they might teach you something, Hell, give me a call, we can chat.  Bump Stocks ≠ machine gun.  You have a military guy in the next office, he should know SOMETHING.
4060 2018-03-23 21:36:15 Hey @realDonaldTrump @POTUS bump stocks are not nearly as dangerous as that budget you just signed. You're pissing around swatting at imaginary bugs while you're helping the swamp rats ruin our country. #Trump #MAGA #Liberty @IngrahamAngle @seanhannity
4061 2018-03-23 21:36:10 The Obama administration didn't make them legal, they were already being sold. The Obama-era ATF decided in 2010 that bump stocks did not come under their regulatory authority. The Trump-era ATF said the same thing in 2017.

But hey what are facts to an ignorant like you?
4062 2018-03-23 21:36:10 Well good for you. Bump stocks are stupid but are they as stupid as the omnibus bill that you just signed. So, where are we going to get an extra 1.3 Trillion dollars? China? The swamp is alive and well.
4063 2018-03-23 21:36:04 What’s unbelievable is that someone thinks bump stocks are protected by the second amendment.
4064 2018-03-23 21:36:03 Misleading lie again. You have continued to roll back all Obama EO's requiring stricter gun control. Bump stocks are not the issue. Fake news Fraud!
4065 2018-03-23 21:35:59 This is untrue. In 2010 the ATF reviewed bump stocks and concluded that they couldn’t be regulated under current law. Obama and Eric Holder (AG) were not involved, and they were never “legalized” because they were never illegal.
4066 2018-03-23 21:35:51 Hope YOU don't own stocks
4067 2018-03-23 21:35:51 I most HIGHLY doubt the Obama administration legalized bump stocks. Mostly like Congress got it past. You reap what you sow, don't you.
4068 2018-03-23 21:35:49 Trump is the problem - not bump stocks, guns, mental health, Clinton or Obama. It’s Trump, period.
4069 2018-03-23 21:35:48 Smokescreen. 
Parkland massacre had nothing to do with bump stocks. 

Nice try.
4070 2018-03-23 21:35:46 NOTHING is achieved by banning bump stocks
We have NO TRUTH to #VegasShooting (other than a secret meeting which is still covered up)

Businesses are gaming your #TaxCuts and DUMPING into Acquisitions
NOT infrastructure
4071 2018-03-23 21:35:46 All in on second amendment but dot need bump stocks.
4072 2018-03-23 21:35:43 Bump stocks are not the problem anymore then the gun is the problem or a car or a knife is the problem. The problem is the people behind the object
4073 2018-03-23 21:35:37 In Oct last year, a bill was brought forward from Feinstein to ban 
Bump stocks. The GOP never brought the bill to the floor. 
By the way, Obama got no money from the NRA in either campaign
4074 2018-03-23 21:35:34 Oh my goodness. Why can't you make an announcement without first disparaging #Obama? Just say bump stocks are bad, we're moving to ban them. That way something that at least resembles leadership isn't undercut by your reflexive pettiness. You're welcome. #dignity #respect
4075 2018-03-23 21:35:30 @GOPChairwoman cancel all my donations for the year if trump bans bump stocks!!!!!!!
4076 2018-03-23 21:35:28 STOP LYING !!!!! Obama didn't legalize bump stocks . There has never been a law to make them legal . ATF claimed in 2010 that bump stocks did not come under their regulatory  authority and said same thing in 2017.
4077 2018-03-23 21:35:28 So now you just LIE BLATANTLY out in the OPEN in BROAD DAYLIGHT???!!!!!! Without ANY regard for the TRUTH whatsoever....
OBAMA didn’t legalized Bump Stocks!!!! #LiarInChief #MoronInChief
4078 2018-03-23 21:35:24 Not exactly right. Bump stocks were not permitted to be regulated due to the manner of which they functioned. The Auto glove & the Atkins Accelerator were allowed to be regulated because of how they functioned.  How about banning automatic weapons NOW!
4079 2018-03-23 21:35:24 As per usual, the President of the United States is not tweeting fully factual information. 
The Obama administration wanted to regulate them, but the law did not allow for bump stock regulation.  
That is not a specific legalization of bump stocks by Obama. 
#FactsFirst
4080 2018-03-23 21:35:19 And we'll be right there suing to prevent the breach of separation of powers, for starters.  Statute defines "machine gun", bump stocks don't make that.
4081 2018-03-23 21:35:15 NRA was ok on the bump stocks.
4082 2018-03-23 21:35:13 The Parkland shooter did not have bump stocks. Time to ban assault weapons period. Maryland has a ban thankfully there was less carnage in that shooting.
4083 2018-03-23 21:35:13 The Obama administration made a ruling that Bump stocks were firearms and not regulated. Not approval at all. But Trump lying about Obama? Pretty typical.
4084 2018-03-23 21:35:09 Don't believe Obama "legalized" bump stocks, current law didn't allow for prohibition.
4085 2018-03-23 21:35:07 I think Trump is really just looking for a bump in Stocks at this point...
4086 2018-03-23 21:35:04 A bump stock does not turn a semi auto into full auto, what has happened to you? 

Is Schumer, Pelosi, Ryan and McConnell blackmailing you?

First you sell us out & capitulate on half your promises by signing this horrific budget and now come out with this lie about bump stocks.
4087 2018-03-23 21:35:04 From the responses I’m reading to this tweet...you’re in trouble with your moron base! They think you’re turning into a swamp creature! Politics is a funny business isn’t it. BTW-Obama did not legalize bump stocks. The ATF under Obama determined  they couldn’t regulate them.
4088 2018-03-23 21:34:56 Want bump stocks outlawed? Pass a law you pussies.
4089 2018-03-23 21:34:56 I need my stocks to stop falling! 
4090 2018-03-23 21:34:56 Probaly cuause no one can buy bump stocks anymore ! Way togo trump
4091 2018-03-23 21:34:40 Tell me what the dems or Obama did. Oh yes the dems or more specific Obama legalized bump stocks which was used in the Vegas shootings.
4092 2018-03-23 21:34:29 Obama and his administration had nothing to do with bump stocks. Quit lying!
4093 2018-03-23 21:34:25 Bump stocks do not make a rifle into a machine gun. Mr. President, you gave been given misinformation. I am surprised you fell for it!
4094 2018-03-23 21:34:19 Bump stocks were never legalized under Obama or any other president. There has never been any legislation regarding them just as Trump has no legislation to ban them. Trump is proposing regulations that will be challenged and defeated. He never stops lying.
4095 2018-03-23 21:34:04 Bump stocks are a bad idea for accuracy but they don't need to be illegal. Law abiding citizens should have access to full auto.
4096 2018-03-23 21:34:03 Bump sticks, stocks, yard sticks, dowels...
4097 2018-03-23 21:34:00 Fake Tweet! As usual you lie... glad you are addressing bump stocks, we’ll see if it stands.
4098 2018-03-23 21:33:50 @realDonaldTrump bump stocks were NEVER legalized by Obama (a great president, ur not). Why do you spew so many lies? Then lie about lying. Again, bump stocks were not made legal by obama. U r such a Lying orange face fool.
4099 2018-03-23 21:33:49 And your statement is based on what research or study?  The Vegas shooter could not have killed so many people without bump stocks.  But I’m glad you get to have fun on the weekends with your pow pow bang bang machines.  That’s what’s most important.
4100 2018-03-23 21:33:46 @EASPORTSFIFA 
Hi,

I have an idea for fifa, why you don’t put the caree mood when I earn money I can buy cars or house or open buy stocks in the same time I have matches, I think this is very great idea to improve the moods in fifa

4101 2018-03-23 21:33:42 No, Obama didn't legalize bump stocks.  Google it - if you know how - and read all about it.

pass a bill to ban bump stocks

the victims of a country music
concert & certainly their family
members were Trump voters?
GOP are slaves to the NRA & Truman nailed it when he
referred to the R's as the
"Do Nothing Congress"
4111 2018-03-23 21:33:23 Wait...Obama legalizes bump stocks but he wanted to come and take everyone's guns?  Trump logic!
4112 2018-03-23 21:33:20 Correction: DID NOT AUTHORIZE!

 #LiarPOTUS 

RT @realDonaldTrump: Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period.
4113 2018-03-23 21:33:17 Twice the ATF decided it could not regulate bump stocks, allowing 2 companies to sell bump stocks. This was not a stmt of Obama’s preferred policy, which called for more regulation of guns, but was what the agency determined it had to do under the language of current law.
4114 2018-03-23 21:33:16 The Wall Street numbers are irrelevant/meaningless to the majority of the people, for we don’t own any kind of stocks.
4115 2018-03-23 21:33:15 People are saying its a free country so bump stocks should be legal.
So by their reckoning heroin,crack and pedos are all ok and should be legalised ..i mean its a free country after all..
4116 2018-03-23 21:33:15 Why don't you print the ENTIRE TRUTH ABOUT OBAMA "LEGALIZING" BUMP STOCKS??  HE DID NOT LEGALIZE THEM, HE COULD NOT REGULATE THEM DUE TO THE WAY THE LANGUAGE OF THE THEN CURRENT LAWS..GOD, YOU ARE A COMPLETE DUMBA$$ AND IF YOU DO HAPPEN TO SPEAK THE TRUTH, IT IS ONLY A HALF TRUTH
4117 2018-03-23 21:33:10 Bump stocks are not enough. Ban assault style weapons.
4118 2018-03-23 21:33:04 Absolutely....I only go to Ashridge certain times - weekday mornings or late evenings if summer... There's a footpath goes up to the Monument from back of where my eldest lived along Stocks Road, Aldbury, which is a lovely walk late evening or very early morning 
4119 2018-03-23 21:33:03 @CloydRivers so what's your take on Trump's recent spending bill and bam on bump stocks.
4120 2018-03-23 21:32:59 Wait till you see the coming rebound in the market. This is a great buying opportunity for stocks . Buckle your seatbelt, it will take your breath away
4121 2018-03-23 21:32:58 Yet another lie, Donnie D-Bag.  Obama admin determined they could not lawfully regulate bump stocks.  Big difference.  You on the other hand, made it easier with people with mental illness to purchase guns.  Own it.  You're a lying swine.
4122 2018-03-23 21:32:55 He did start the process to make bump stocks illegal. That is something.
4123 2018-03-23 21:32:54 At least he bans bump stocks lol
4124 2018-03-23 21:32:48 BUMP STOCKS do NOTHING.  MAN you're having a BAD DAY.  I can pull a trigger just as fast without it, and even with a FULL AUTO you are less accurate than single fire regular semi auto.  I wouldn't WANT faster rounds if I were trying to kill people.  WISE UP.
4125 2018-03-23 21:32:47 Obama DID NOT legalize bump stocks.  Do you know anything about anything at all!
4126 2018-03-23 21:32:46 On your way to ANOTHER vacation at Trump Resort, & you can't stop your lying tweets as @POTUS. Nobody legalized bump stocks, but you are terrified of NRA & will back down as soon as they object. Using your personal twitter acct for govt business?
4127 2018-03-23 21:32:43 Lol Trump pissing off his entire base today with the omnibus bill and banning bump stocks. It's glorious to see the Trumptards turn on each other.
4128 2018-03-23 21:32:41 Donnie, Are you rewriting the law? Because at the time lawyers at the ATF said the way the law was written they could not block bump stocks. They did stop two other designs. I’m against bump stocks, btw.
4129 2018-03-23 21:32:34 Aqui aplaudiendo a nuestro presidente Trump q ordenó  ban los bump stocks algo tan absurdo que legalizó el alborotador en jefe Hussein Obama. Y de eso no habla la prensa liberal alias fake news? No he oído a ninguno, todos enfocados en las actrices porno. Please @CarinesMoncada
4130 2018-03-23 21:32:27 The law did not permit Obama Administration to prohibit bump stocks, as bump stocks were not considered firearms. As non-mechanized accessory to a firearm, the ATF could not ban it. Nice try, though. Man, you sure are obsessed with Obama...I mean, I get it. We miss him too...
4131 2018-03-23 21:32:25 Banning bump stocks and caving to the Swamp’s $1.3T Omnibus pork DNC lobbyist filled monstrosity is not draining a damn thing! @JebBush and @BarackObama both would be proud of you. This was your chance. Unbelievable.  #NotWinning
4132 2018-03-23 21:32:20 Nope. Facebook falling stocks would not effect all stocks. That isn't how it works. 

Fears of a trade war and riding prices will effect the market though.
4133 2018-03-23 21:32:19 Obama did not legalize bump stocks, but by all means go ahead and keep making stuff up.
4134 2018-03-23 21:32:12 80% of Dems want to ban semi-autos and 50% want to ban guns period. They couldn't care less about bump stocks or NICS or 'common sense gun reform', they want them gone. Any concession we make is an own goal.
4135 2018-03-23 21:32:05 You are a F#CKING LIAR . . . AGAIN! President Obama did not legalize Bump Stocks. He tried for stricter gun laws but your GOP kept blocking him. Do you ever tell the truth? You have such an evil heart, if you even have a heart.
4136 2018-03-23 21:32:01 NO!  Obama DID NOT legalize bump stocks like Trump just Tweeted.  The law simply did not allow Obama to prohibit bump stocks.  If congress wanted to regulate them they could have.  President Trump is WRONG! Bump stocks weren't considered an issue until after the Vegas shootings.
4137 2018-03-23 21:32:01 @TomiLahren what are your thoughts on this new spending bill and the ban on bump stocks?
4138 2018-03-23 21:31:58 Hypocrites Mark. DACA unconstitutional when Obama did it. Now GOP going to make it permanent.  Bump stocks declared not against the current laws. Trump going to change by executive order.  How is that not unconstitutional?
4139 2018-03-23 21:31:57 Bump Stocks were not invented then. In fact one shot a minute was an achievement
4140 2018-03-23 21:31:53 $LTC.X $ETH.X  only all the Money leaving stocks would end up here
4141 2018-03-23 21:31:52 Show me in the constitution where it says bump stocks are a right. I'll wait.
4142 2018-03-23 21:31:48 The first part of this is untrue. And, I will believe a ban on bump stocks when I see it. Trump says a lot of things and then changes his mind. Maybe the NRA will talk to him tomorrow and he'll take this back.
4143 2018-03-23 21:31:46 Dear Donald, stop with the birtherism, we're sick of it! And bump stocks are not the problem! What a disgraceful excuse for a leader you are.
4144 2018-03-23 21:31:31 Liar.  The Obama administration didn't legalize any such thing.  They ruled that bump stocks were not firearms and as such couldn't be tegulated under the then current legislation.  But, I should be kind as you are the moron Tillerson named you.
4145 2018-03-23 21:31:22 Oh FFS the Obama administration did not legalize bump stocks. Another one of your off the cuff, who cares if it's true but sounds good comments? No babysitters left obviously
4146 2018-03-23 21:31:19 God... any idiot know Obama did not legalize bump stocks.
4147 2018-03-23 21:31:14 Obama did not legalize bump stocks, they were being sold before he took office. Every Single Statement from the Orange Shitstain is a freakin lie.
4148 2018-03-23 21:31:09 Yeah!   There's a legal process for obtaining a federal permit for an automatic weapon.   Bump stocks are designed to circumvent the law.
4149 2018-03-23 21:31:06 You are so ridiculous - always blaming everyone else NEVER taking any responsibility - the Parkland let movement is NOT about bumbsticks - it is about banning AR-15 and other military assault guns .  You should have Berne’s bump stocks after the Vegas massacre #Kingoftheswamp
4150 2018-03-23 21:31:05 Did they mention bump-stocks in the 2nd Amendment?  I missed that part.
4151 2018-03-23 21:31:05 2nd amendment doesn't include "except it's okay to infringe on automatic weapons". And yes, there were automatic weapons before 1789. Bans on machine guns and bump stocks are unconstitutional !!
4152 2018-03-23 21:31:01 Trump causing stocks to fall is one of the meriad of reasons he should be removed.
4153 2018-03-23 21:31:01 There is some merit to this since the @ATFHQ said it couldn't ban Bump Stocks during the Obama Admin because the law didn't permit them from doing so.
BTW, Obama admin created stricter gun regulations and you came into office and overturned all of his regulations
4154 2018-03-23 21:30:59 Stop blaming President Obama for your failure to call for a ban of AR-15s & other military grade weapons. Your plan for banning bump stocks is too little too late. You're just doing the bidding of the NRAcists & the 30 million dollars they gave you. #MarchForOurLives #NeverAgain
4155 2018-03-23 21:30:56 For the record Obama administration did not legalize bump stocks. Who do you think you are kidding with that BS? Obama would have banned it in a second. It was the ATF who understood to their constitutional limitations & knew they had no authority to prevent bump stocks.
4156 2018-03-23 21:30:51 His sons love guns. I do too.  Plus 2A isn’t going away.  He threw a bone on something until Vegas, my hubby hadn’t even heard about. Not his friends ( they purchased some: and now are illegal in WA state).  Bump stocks are crap. They don’t shoot accurately, and jam
4157 2018-03-23 21:30:48 If you read the capitalized portion of this tweet you get BAD IDEA BAN BUMP STOCKS  

Donald is trolling all of us...
4158 2018-03-23 21:30:46 Bump stocks ok there a waste of money anyway!! But don’t cross to many lines guys!! The people are still in control of this country don’t forget who you serve got it!!!
4159 2018-03-23 21:30:40 Maybe you should read it. The Right to Bear Arms "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." I don't see anything about bump stocks, do you?
4160 2018-03-23 21:30:35 I'm a white male. I'm a business owner who owns property and stocks and I'm also smart enough not to support Trump and I don't have to make up statistics.
4161 2018-03-23 21:30:30 You make Bolton your national security advisor and your complaining about bump stocks!? We will need them, this bastard will lead us to WWIII!
4162 2018-03-23 21:30:24 Obama legalized bump stocks? I doubt that. More of your fake news spins.
4163 2018-03-23 21:30:22 Could care less about bump stocks I voted for you to deliver...... you failed today, very weak very bad deal for gop, hugely disappointing.
4164 2018-03-23 21:30:16 Gun for self defence. When people fix bump stocks turning them automated clearly proving their intentions to have gun not to protect selves but to fulfill sadistic desires outcome of cognitive disorders of various degrees further aggravated by malicious acts of those around them.
4165 2018-03-23 21:30:08 Bump stocks weren’t used in any shooting except Las Vegas. It’s a no brainer tiny step.
4166 2018-03-23 21:30:01 A tumultuous week for stock markets didn't stop the experts at Asia's biggest investment conference from doubling down on tech stocks, writes @TonyBoydAFR.
4167 2018-03-23 21:29:53 Somebody tell him that nobody wants to ban bump stocks and banning them won’t help anything.
4168 2018-03-23 21:29:50 So? It’s my doctrine and a similar one to the NRA. Bump stocks in reality don’t mean a thing, but it’s just another step to governmental supremacy.
4169 2018-03-23 21:29:41 You better watch it Sir we are being censored ONLINE and no one who knows guns cares too much about bump stocks,  the only tweet I dont like
4170 2018-03-23 21:29:40 The Obama Administration DID NOT legalize bump stocks, they were already being used. Stop lying please. Stop going after Obama, etc and focus on making the US great again. Everyone is sick of you blaming everything on everyone else.
4171 2018-03-23 21:29:26 Speaking of stocks, aren’t you going to take responsibility for the market downturn?  You were quick to claim responsibility when it went up!
4172 2018-03-23 21:29:23 Yeah, but Trumpykins probably thinks bump stocks are something to do with the market, not guns.
4173 2018-03-23 21:29:20 Bump stocks aren’t the problem and you know it
4174 2018-03-23 21:29:16 Well you take evil people and mix with bump stocks and AR’s you have a problem.
4175 2018-03-23 21:29:13 Jeff Sessions announces rule effectively banning bump stocks. Strike 1
4176 2018-03-23 21:29:11 NO!  Obama DID NOT legalize bump stocks like Trump just Tweeted.  The law simply did not allow Obama to prohibit bump stocks.  If congress wanted to regulate them they could have.  President Trump is WRONG! Bump stocks weren't considered an issue until after the Vegas shootings.
4177 2018-03-23 21:29:10 sorry sir, you are misinformed. Bump Stocks do not turn guns into ilegal machine guns.
4178 2018-03-23 21:29:09 ATF and DOJ both determined that it would take Congressional action to ban bump stocks. I guess you thought it was ok to rescind DACA because no legislation, but you can unilaterally ban bump stocks. Ok by me, but inconsistent behavior by you. Restore DACA.
4179 2018-03-23 21:28:58 Nope.  (Bump stocks harness a weapon’s recoil to cause the user’s finger to  squeeze the trigger repeatedly, but because they don’t alter the gun’s  internal mechanisms, they were considered lawful) So does that make this....FAKE NEWS?
4180 2018-03-23 21:28:55 You have bigger problems than bump stocks, you have about a year to regain my support and vote. I would rather be put in front of firing squad than vote for a Democrate so you better hope you can win me back or another Republican don't run
4181 2018-03-23 21:28:52 Sell the FB stocks if you have any ;)
4182 2018-03-23 21:28:50 .@realDonaldTrump  ATF decided it could not regulate bump stocks during Obama admin.
These decisions allowed 2 companies to sell bump stocks.Important to note this was NOT a statement of Obama’s preferred policy, but was what ATF determined it had to do under the language of law.
4183 2018-03-23 21:28:49 WHOAH, slow down sir, where did Bump Stocks come into play today. topics today was:

1. Veto the bill
2. War monger Bolton
3. Russia Investigation
4. Stormy Daniels

In any particular order  #covfefe!
4184 2018-03-23 21:28:45 It's always good to evaluate your mistakes and learn from them (but not over-learn). 
In the public space, my biggest mistakes have not been the stocks that blew up, but selling stocks like $CELG and $ALXN *way* too early because they looked expensive.
4185 2018-03-23 21:28:41 It’s getting really difficult to identify the dumb one in your family. 

The Obama administration did not legalize bump stocks.
4186 2018-03-23 21:28:35 Bump stocks suck.
4187 2018-03-23 21:28:32 Even in the red state of Idaho, farming friends of mine well aware we live in a global economy. Pushing protectionism to the point of a trade war will affect their take-home, sink stocks & cost GOP "bigly" in mid-terms.
4188 2018-03-23 21:28:30 Stocks go up and @realDonaldTrump jumps right in to take credit.  Stocks plummet due to something he obviously did and not a f-ing word.  What an ass.
4189 2018-03-23 21:28:24 Number of leading stocks today: 17 $SPY $QQQ $FB $GOOG $AMZN $GOOG $AAPL #DailyStkLeaderCount
4190 2018-03-23 21:28:16 Either you are completely stupid and have no idea how the government works or you just hold out right lie. Obama never legalized bump stocks. This is just some fantasy that came out of your delusional mind. The Republican Congress would not allow regulation of them.
4191 2018-03-23 21:28:15 Why do you constantly lie and blame others for things they didn’t do? You know Obama didn’t legalize bump stocks. You deliberately mischaracterize it. The ATF simply ruled that the current law didn’t make bump stocks illegal, which you agree with or you wouldn’t be changing it.
4192 2018-03-23 21:28:13 Very disappointed in your choice to ban bump stocks Mr. President we put you in office to protect the #2A no to push for gun control. You do not have my vote in 2020.
4193 2018-03-23 21:28:12 What did bump stocks have to do in the shooting that left 17 kids dead?
4194 2018-03-23 21:28:11 Mr @POTUS , you are letting us down here.  Banning bump stocks in NO WAY makes America great again, quite the opposite.  We supported you, and now you are turning your back on us. Seriously disappointed. #MAGA
4195 2018-03-23 21:28:04 I do not agree with this decision, Mr. President. What is this decision in response to? The shooting in Vegas that's been completely covered up by the FBI? Is the country safer for giving up bump stocks?
4196 2018-03-23 21:27:51 Bump stocks r dope
4197 2018-03-23 21:27:49 Have you been sniffing amyl nitrate?Nobody gives a flying fuk about bump stocks.
4198 2018-03-23 21:27:48 Bump the stocks market instead
4199 2018-03-23 21:27:37 Respectfully disagree. There are no compelling reasons to need bump stocks. I am full on #2A, @NRA, and reciprocal carry supporter and this doesn’t bother me at all.
4200 2018-03-23 21:27:34 Ban assault rifles bump stocks and high capacity magazines now today do it
4201 2018-03-23 21:27:27 However, many do own stocks indirectly through union pension funds - and exerting pressure there can be helpful.
4202 2018-03-23 21:27:19 Justice Department to ban bump stocks #US | #RTGNews
4203 2018-03-23 21:27:15 My concern is that managing these regulations through the Justice Department isn’t a constitutional means of banning bump stock sales. Bump stocks are neither arms nor ordinance, so it’s hard to say if this falls under any federal reach, except perhaps commerce. #10thAmendment
4204 2018-03-23 21:27:12 LIes, lies and more lies...the GOP controlled Congress plus the NRA Democrats allowed bump stocks
4205 2018-03-23 21:27:11 Did you know you could do the same thing with a belt loop? And tell me, how many documented cases of people getting shot with bump stocks do we have?? This is useless...
4206 2018-03-23 21:27:10 lmao he will probably back out of banning bump stocks at the last minute, just like he reversed court on the Omnibus deal.
4207 2018-03-23 21:27:08 Never heard of bump stocks being used for anything,    good for shooting up the broadside of a barn maybe , lucky to hit that after the first couple of rounds
4208 2018-03-23 21:27:08 I would rather line up their teachers in old fashioned stocks in the middle of town square. Kids learn only what they have been taught.  None of this is spontaneous - part of the "New Civics" instituted by Obama.
4209 2018-03-23 21:27:07 President Obama did not legalize bump stocks.The law did not "allow" Obama to prohibit bump stocks. Congress could have regulated them but didn't. You are twisting facts as usual... again.
4210 2018-03-23 21:27:02 Bullshit.  The ATF ruled in 2010 that bump stocks were not a firearm subject to regulation and allowed their sale as an unregulated firearm part
4211 2018-03-23 21:27:01 What do you want bump stocks for?
4212 2018-03-23 21:26:57 Actually bump stocks were never illegal, the ATF reviewed them and they did not find them to violate any existing law or rule
4213 2018-03-23 21:26:40 Best time to take advantage of this noise around #tariffs and buy quality stocks. Markets are currently at: S&P=2588, Dow=23533, Nasdaq=6992, one day I’ll screenshot this tweet and tweet it out and the only thing you’ll regret is why you didn’t listen to me. #StockMarket #Bullish – bij University of Southern California
4214 2018-03-23 21:26:39 "Obama Administration legalized bump stocks."

Not that I expect you to know or care about the truth, but this is horseshit. In 2010, the ATF issued a letter (correctly) noting that bump stocks did not violate current laws. Obama wanted them gone.
4215 2018-03-23 21:26:35 Well heroin is illegal but that doesn’t stop the addicts from acquiring it - what makes anyone think some piece of paper will stop criminals from acquiring bump stocks?
4216 2018-03-23 21:26:29 @realDonaldTrump You took NRA money when bump stocks were legal. Didn't seem to bother you then.
4217 2018-03-23 21:26:26 @potus You took credit for my stock gains. You can now take credit for my losses. @realDonaldTrump @foxnation @foxandfriends #stocks @theSNP
4218 2018-03-23 21:26:24 Dead wrong. The atf decided they were legal not obama. Bump stocks even come with a certified letter from the ATF stating they are legal.
4219 2018-03-23 21:26:21 Bump Stocks ate NOT the issue here FOOL
4220 2018-03-23 21:26:16 As much as i agree with banning bump stocks, I doubt this regulation will hold up in court. I Believe the @ATFHQ was the agency that mentioned this.
4221 2018-03-23 21:26:14 Another lie!  Bump stocks were never illegal but, banning them is a good step.  

Pssst...did you know your base is kinda mad about the bill you signed?  
4222 2018-03-23 21:26:13 Obama did not legalize bump stocks.  Jesus you have no clue whats going but to lie everyday.
4223 2018-03-23 21:26:13 Bump stocks are said to be not that important for allowing gun ownership - plus it's only a very recent thing if it was Obama that allowed them. Second, fully automatic machine guns are illegal anyway? So Trump has taken an action that effectively does almost nothing?
4224 2018-03-23 21:26:12 Moi je ne fais pas encore donc je n'ai pas ce genre de stocks 
4225 2018-03-23 21:26:06 Not liking the omnibus, but if @realDonaldTrump supports it, then I am sure in the grand scheme of things it will be for the best. Bump stocks are just one of many full auto conversions available. Many other options
4226 2018-03-23 21:26:06 Obama approved bump stocks he also gave guns to drug cartels. His economy sucked and lied about everything. Thank god that nightmare is over! 
4227 2018-03-23 21:26:05 Why did Carl Icahn, Mark Zuckerberg,etc Others Get Rid Of Stocks Before Bad News Announcements Dealing Wt. Their companies?? It’s All Rigged!!
4228 2018-03-23 21:26:03 Caught lying again. Obama DID NOT legalize bump stocks. The law did not allow Obama to prohibit bump stocks.  If congress wanted to regulate them they could have. #GOP would not do anything for gun control. Your all in the pocket of the NRA. You took $30,000,0000+ from them.
4229 2018-03-23 21:25:57 Stocks to Watch: PETX, JWN, MDB. Read our in-depth analysis for more.
4230 2018-03-23 21:25:57 Your so full of shit Obama never legalized bump stocks stop lying to everyone
4231 2018-03-23 21:25:55 Why has the founder of Facebook Zuckerberg. Sold since last year $1 billion in stocks in Facebook?? What does he know
4232 2018-03-23 21:25:48 I support you, but this bill was not a win no matter how you try to spin it now your shifting to bump stocks really. Man you should have at least have the democrats throw in Ben Carlson dining set for hud. This is sad
4233 2018-03-23 21:25:42 Banning ANYTHING only effects the law abiding. Criminals, psychopaths, and sociopaths IGNORE the law and will still find a way to obtain bump stocks. 
Just like the AK-47 is illegal, yet gangs members have them.
4234 2018-03-23 21:25:38 The NRA said, "The Obama administration approved the sale of bump fire stocks on at least two occasions."

We indeed found two occasions in which ATF, a bureau within the executive branch, decided it could not regulate bump stocks during the Obama administration.
4235 2018-03-23 21:25:34 The ATF (under Obama) determined that bump stocks were not regulated by existing laws. That's not exactly the same a step "approving" them.
4236 2018-03-23 21:25:32 Not a word is mentioned in the second amendment about bump stocks. Thank you Mr. Trump for all your doing!
4237 2018-03-23 21:25:29 These decisions allowed two companies to sell bump stocks. It’s important to note this was not a statement of Obama’s preferred policy, which called for more regulation of guns, but was what the agency determined it had to do under the language of current law.
4238 2018-03-23 21:25:25 We're these bump stocks patented? Who ok'd that? What was the designer thinking about except $$$$$$$$$.
4239 2018-03-23 21:25:20 Lemme get this straight

Teens pick on kids till they feel they have to shoot up their school.

Then teens say it’s the adult that make the decisions about gun laws that allow them to shoot up schools?

Sounds like teens are the problem not bump stocks. Maybe we should ban teens.
4240 2018-03-23 21:25:15 Please do not abandon Trump. He has no support from right wing Republicans or any Democrats. The world needs this man more than you need bump stocks. The bill was set up to trap him by enemies of law abiding Americans, MAGA.
4241 2018-03-23 21:25:12 That is all good to get the bump stocks off the streets, next should be the AR-15 assault rifles. Does Sessions have the guts to do that?
4242 2018-03-23 21:25:10 Obama legalized bump stocks as much as he legalized cat food. they were both already legal.

You try and legalize hatred and discrimination, but go ahead. Obama Obama Obama.

He's still not into you, you know.
4243 2018-03-23 21:25:05 the stocks do need a bump...
4244 2018-03-23 21:25:04 YOU JUST BLATANTLY LIED AND ACTED LIKE HE SAID OBAMA LEGALIZED BUMP STOCKS  I just can’t with how dumb these people are
4245 2018-03-23 21:25:01 Aren't the trump supporters still happy they supported cutting corporate taxes by the billions so the money could be used to buy back stocks and increase dividends? I know trumps supporters will be very happy when their social security & medicare is cut after midterms!
4246 2018-03-23 21:25:00 Bad idea. Bump stocks are pieces of plastic that can be had for a hundred bucks. They are not the problem. There is literally zero reason to do this, other than to appease the uninformed left. SMH. Worst decision made as @POTUS to date.
4247 2018-03-23 21:25:00 How did the Obama Administration "legalize" bump stocks? God, Trump's idiocy and naked jealousy of Obama are getting worse.
4248 2018-03-23 21:24:59 A Republican Congress legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns until the terrorist group @NRA can buy more politicians.

#FixedItForYou #FakePresident
4249 2018-03-23 21:24:56 Here you go again showing yourself to be a total hypocrite by spreading fake news. The truth is the law did not permit them the Obama admin to prohibit bump stocks since it is a firearm part & not regulated under the gun control act or national firearms act
4250 2018-03-23 21:24:55 Bump stocks we're supposedly created to assist the disabled shoot guns. An inclusive idea that backfired bc of murderous psychopaths. I would like to hear a person's take on this who uses the bump stock as intended. Could a special permit be a solution? Opinions wanted
4251 2018-03-23 21:24:47 thank god they got the bump stocks, Shootings are a thing of the past!
4252 2018-03-23 21:24:45 Wait a SECOND you are banning bump stocks but if the kid down the street goes out and buys Ak-47 & KILLS A dozen people, HOW DID THAT HELP
4253 2018-03-23 21:24:41 Trump F'ed up today. Over spending and over reaching. At least Planned Parenthood is still funded, "the wall" isn't and those evil bump stocks are gone. #MAGA
4254 2018-03-23 21:24:40 Budget bill.

Also he's legislating via pen & phone, obama style, to ban perfectly legal bump stocks.

So much for defending the 2nd amendment. I guess we all knew he'd revert to his NYC Liberal ways eventually. At least we got one good conservative year out of him.
4255 2018-03-23 21:24:28 No, the Obama administration determined they could not legally prohibit bump stocks. They did not "legalize" them. You, a Republican, are going to go big government and ban them, apparently. Why not leave that to Congress, our lawmaking body?
4256 2018-03-23 21:24:27 Can’t distract from the Omnibus boondoggle w bump stocks. You let down the American people. What happened to #maga #CampaignPromises ?
4257 2018-03-23 21:24:23 You really think an administration that wanted gun control would approve BUMP stocks?? You believe your own lies
4258 2018-03-23 21:24:23 bump stocks aren’t firearms therefore Obama Administration couldn’t of legalize them. Congress actually has to create law.
4259 2018-03-23 21:24:20 Bump stocks are a waste of money but still this is a direct attack on freedom and the ability to choose.
4260 2018-03-23 21:24:19 In the words of Reagan, there you go again blaming #Obama. Dude, you are the President. Fact: ATF can’t ban bump stocks UNLESS Congress amends existing law or passes a new one.  ATF approved devices in 2010, finding they didn’t amount to machine guns. #GunReformNow #NRA
4261 2018-03-23 21:24:15 Not only does he lie about Obama making "laws" as POTUS, but he can't do anything about "bump stocks" without an act from Congress. He's too stupid to know that they DON'T turn a semi-automatic into a "machine gun". There's nothing he can do so his statement is worthless.
4262 2018-03-23 21:24:15 Ar-15s are not the problem and neither are bump stocks.  The problem is we need more good civilians with guns. Because nothing stops gun crime faster than a gun.
4263 2018-03-23 21:24:09 PARKLAND was supposed to be a 1-2 punch after Las Vegas. First, they get us off-balance on semi-auto versus full auto, so WE are not "common sense".  Then they use kids to make it emotional, so they can throw bump stocks at us on their CNN propaganda shows. PLANNED PSY-OPS.
4264 2018-03-23 21:23:51 Bump Stocks are your concerns?? :D
4265 2018-03-23 21:23:51 Obama legalized bump stocks but wanted to take everyone's gun away? Pick an argument!
4266 2018-03-23 21:23:40 MAGAs have 2 turn in their bump stocks the irony has killed me
4267 2018-03-23 21:23:38 If you let them have this, you better get something in return for it. I have no problem with bump stocks, they don't kill anyone by themselves nor were they used in any of the recent shootings. If it takes that to get armed teachers, I say that is a good trade. Be careful.
4268 2018-03-23 21:23:34 Obama administration didn't actually legalize bump stocks. That's the NRA once again twisting the events of truth in their favor, and if I am correct Trump has dismantled more guns laws than any other president has in last 50 yrs.
So once again Trump is #DELUSIONAL666
4269 2018-03-23 21:23:31 Quoting the NRA take on Obama Admin. & bump stock. Fast & loose with the facts, again. ATF determined bump stocks had no mechanical moving parts so under the current law they could not be regulated unless the law was changed. There was no will by the GOP to make a change. FACTS!
4270 2018-03-23 21:23:30 Wow of all the issues bump stocks now? There is already a state by state gun grab which is unconstitutional. 2a# gift to Dems.
4271 2018-03-23 21:23:26 Stop with your lies. You know full well he did no such thing. The ‘legalization’ has everything to do with the way bump stocks are viewed via the National Firearms Act. Your gaslighting knows no bounds. Thanks for the banning though. Your base is gonna lose their shit.
4272 2018-03-23 21:23:18 Everything is done for a reason
Obama was a gun control advocate yet quthorized bump stocks
Why?
4273 2018-03-23 21:23:17 No such thing as an assault rifle.   And bump stocks help disabled people shoot.  

I love mine.  They’re fun. 

Cede this ground and they’ll be on to the next thing in short order.
4274 2018-03-23 21:23:15 Define assault rifle.
Also, bump stocks are easy to make.
4275 2018-03-23 21:23:15 How can’t gun the was buy legally be illegal bump stocks is not the problem easy gun purchasers are ever mass shootings was done by a legal purchase in a pro gun state how about that cash me out.
4276 2018-03-23 21:23:12 I didn't see panic in any stocks.
4277 2018-03-23 21:23:12 yep...lost almost $800 today which equals out to over $1500 in the last 2 days #stocks
4278 2018-03-23 21:23:11 Rims are for aesthetic purpose, bump stocks are not. Terrible comparison.
4279 2018-03-23 21:23:10 "Legalized bump stocks" or bump stocks started selling in the eight years Obama was President and the NRA made sure the ATF could not regulate add ons?
4280 2018-03-23 21:23:06 This idiot in the WH has screwed up the country around the world now he is messing with our stocks. GET HIM OUT!
4281 2018-03-23 21:23:05 Nice wee soundbite for Trump en-route to Florida to ban bump stocks. Not a good way to stop erosion in his base, though.
4282 2018-03-23 21:23:02 I'm an ex military and 2nd amendment supporter but bump stocks have no place in civilian life. They need to go.
4283 2018-03-23 21:22:57 No, because individual stocks can go up on a daily basis for reasons that are bad for the overall economy, for example layoffs
4284 2018-03-23 21:22:50 Only if “determined the law did not allow banning bump stocks, and recommended congress pass a law” means “approved”.
4285 2018-03-23 21:22:48 Does that mean the tech stocks are up in smoke?
4286 2018-03-23 21:22:48 Comrade, you are easily the most brazen liar to ever “serve” as president*. The Obama administration did not legalize bump stocks, you imbecile. Also while bump stocks are terrible & should be illegal, they are a very small part of our epidemic of gun violence.
4287 2018-03-23 21:22:39 As usual, you are lying. The Obama administration's preferred policy was more gun regulation, but the ATF had limited authority under language of current law. In order to ban bump stocks, new legislation would have to be issued. Your move.
4288 2018-03-23 21:22:26 Im selling bump stocks
4289 2018-03-23 21:22:13 This is only part of the story and part true The company that makes bump stocks lied as to what it could do and be used for. Kinda what Trump does everyday
4290 2018-03-23 21:22:09 Banning bump stocks in no way infringe upon a citizen's right t yo bear arms.
4291 2018-03-23 21:22:05 Yeah thanks for making the slippery slope a little bit slipperier.  Instead of worrying about bump stocks and caving to the left, why don't you explain why you think congress needs a pay raise and why you signed that disgusting bill.
4292 2018-03-23 21:21:57 China's prompt retaliation after Donald #Trump promised to slap taxes on $US60 billion ($78 billion) of Chinese goods caused a global #stocks sell-off with fears that worse is to come. #ASX #ausbiz
4293 2018-03-23 21:21:51 Do people lie to you and then you repeat their lies or do you come up with the lies all on your own?

Obama absolutely did not legalize bump stocks.
4294 2018-03-23 21:21:46 It's the same as it ever was. .... bump stocks.  That's where we are going after today's disaster.  Welcome to the swamp.
4295 2018-03-23 21:21:45 stocks down again today. and even more scandals affecting the market along with the normal dumb administration snafus
4296 2018-03-23 21:21:40 There was NEVER any "legalization" of bump stocks, per say.
4297 2018-03-23 21:21:37 Why do you capitalize BUMP STOCKS?? is that supposed to make your point any more concrete?
4298 2018-03-23 21:21:34 You sold us OUT and all you can do is talk about bump stocks!!.. Like Rome Bread & Circus.

4300 2018-03-23 21:21:33 I agree.
Are we going to ban fingers too? I can empty a 30 rounds clip fast enough to sound like a machine gun.
I don't like AR15's or bump stocks, I know I'll never own one - (but I don't want them banned!) because I know it won't end here.
4301 2018-03-23 21:21:30 Turn in my bump stocks I purchased legally with hard earned money fuck you!!!!!
Now if you want to purchase some back we can discuss that.
4302 2018-03-23 21:21:15 Obama was legalizing bump stocks while taking away the guns?. #DonTheCon
4303 2018-03-23 21:21:07 This has got to rival the #TwinkieDefense. Six months later and that's what we get. A lame video pastiche and "the bump stocks did it."  It happened on your watch POTUS. Trump has a business to protect here too. #Coverup
4304 2018-03-23 21:21:06 I think you'll find its evil people WITH bump stocks that are the problem.  You allow those two to come together and.... KABAM! you've got dead and injured concert goers.
4305 2018-03-23 21:20:52 And maybe tanks, howitzers, and bazookas! And while we’re at it, how about nuclear weapons? This wins most idiotic tweet of the week. Maybe the month. Law-abiding Americans don’t need bump stocks, assault weapons, or other weapons of mass distruction.
4306 2018-03-23 21:20:46 That's silly. Which responsible gun owner really cares about bump stocks?

Sure, you can't pretend it will stop shootings, buy it won't affect people's ability to defend themselves from others or from the government.
4307 2018-03-23 21:20:45 As usual you're lying. The Obama Administration did not "legalize" bump stocks. The law at the time prohibited bump stocks from being regulated and therefore nothing could be done to stop them from being manufactured. However, if you can effectively ban them...good.
4308 2018-03-23 21:20:45 Really??Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. With a Republican majority how did that happen?  Why a rule and not a law to ban bump stocks??? Just more meaningless words.  Just stop tweeting
4309 2018-03-23 21:20:43 Trump WEAK ON BUMP STOCKS SINCE VEGAS - LAST YEAR- NRA - Trump never took any action after the Vegas massacre - LARGEST MASS KILLING EVER IN AMERICA - UNDER TRUMP!! TOTALLY WEAK ON BACKGROUND CHECKS  - SAD!!
4310 2018-03-23 21:20:39 This is a sincere question - since ATF is simply a department of the govt (as is DOJ), why does ATF override DOJ? If there was a court decision about banning bump stocks, I'd understand, but don't understand an ATF reg cancelling a DOJ reg.
4311 2018-03-23 21:20:30 I think banning bump stocks may have the undesired effect of vastly improving the accuracy of shooters by getting rid of such a stupid mod.
4312 2018-03-23 21:20:27 Obama legalized Bump stocks. Trump is moving to ban them. And still, the crazy narrative turns to the @NRA 
4313 2018-03-23 21:20:26 B.S. Donnie bump stocks were not authorized by no one
4314 2018-03-23 21:20:25 LIAR!!! Decisions allowed two companies to sell bump stocks. It’s important to note this was not a statement of Obama’s preferred policy, which called for more regulation of guns, but was what the agency determined it had to do under the language of current law. 
You bend truth.
4315 2018-03-23 21:20:24 @karenfinerman Hi. For as long as I've heard of GOOGL, I've heard you can't deny the valuation. Is there a message in the persistence of this condition? Most stocks move between the extremes of over- and under-valuation. How do you interpret this? Thank you.
4316 2018-03-23 21:20:23 Big deal Jeffy, what good are bump stocks after they take away all the guns.
4317 2018-03-23 21:20:22 U.S. stock indexes are now flat since November; @RealDonaldTrump, who not too long ago took credit for the market, has tweeted about stocks just once since Jan. 26. Billions in market cap have been erased since
4318 2018-03-23 21:20:14 Obama DID NOT legalize bump stocks!  Can you just tweet one time without lying?  Just once?  #ImpeachTrumpNow
4319 2018-03-23 21:20:13 j'ai besoin de toi comme d'une infirmière que tu répares ma tête et mes sentiments qui fonctionnent plus bien que tu refasses mes stocks de sérotonine que tu me dises que c'est rien
4320 2018-03-23 21:20:10 Obama did more for gun sales than any other president. So afraid people were that he was gonna grab their guns, they went gun buying crazy. Since Trump- the market is stagnant. But Obama NEVER okayed Bump stocks. Trump is nuts
4321 2018-03-23 21:20:06 You may feel like stocks are volatile. And you’re right. But history shows us they become less so if you can think longer term. If you do that, your relative performance likely improves over time. Don’t forget that lesson.
4322 2018-03-23 21:20:05 Bump Stocks are not what the students are marching about it is about assault weapons that they want BANNED...this won't work!!
4323 2018-03-23 21:19:59 Only idiots believe that bump stocks enhance a rifle. They’ll believe anything the media says. Hope you enjoy serving as a one term president.
4324 2018-03-23 21:19:58 I would have preferred you let the government shut down and fix that budget. Guess your first party choice of Democrat is starting to show. Bump Stocks are a Democrat distraction. 
They can be replicated with 3 screws and a short board, no win for Americans.
4325 2018-03-23 21:19:52 Awesome stock $Drop looks like a winner for biggest retain to trades $DROP #SkyPorts, #Solar, #Tech #Stocks #NYSE
4326 2018-03-23 21:19:47 This move of banning bump stocks, over 5 months after Las Vegas and on the eve of #MarchForOurLives stinks of "better do something and hope it sticks" until Monday morning.
4327 2018-03-23 21:19:44 Big misstep today Mr President and won’t see me back to your defense. Ps bump stocks suck anyway does not impress me. You are now a one term president in my eyes!
4328 2018-03-23 21:19:43 Wait what happens when to stocks crash, oh yeh it's negative demand shock, oil market has always been bi polar with a short attention span
4329 2018-03-23 21:19:36 Fear of trade war sinks stocks, 4:54 PM, The Dow finished the day down more than 400 points and has lost 1,100 points in two days. It's at its lowest point since November.
4330 2018-03-23 21:19:23 Damn! I just read the Second Amendment and could not find the words bump stocks, gat cranks, or high capacity magazines. Actually..it does not even mention "firearms".
4331 2018-03-23 21:19:19 Obama administration determined bump stocks did not fall under any legislation to stop its manufacture. You are just now throwing this out to deflect and undermine the March For Life protests.
4332 2018-03-23 21:19:15 Bump stocks are the new punk rock, all the cool kids are doing it.
4333 2018-03-23 21:19:11 Gasp. Wasn’t Obama the guy who wanted to take away all the #MAGA guns? And he legalized bump stocks? What gives, Don?
4334 2018-03-23 21:19:01 The Obama Administration didn’t legalize bump stocks. They got invented durning that time. Nice try, trying to twist things.
4335 2018-03-23 21:18:59 Another misleading statement by you...BIG surprise, NO. Obama admin did not legalized bump stocks; said that there was no law allowing for the regulation on them.
4336 2018-03-23 21:18:57 On another note. I heard some stocks are down?

Good time to buy them, right?
4337 2018-03-23 21:18:53 No one with any intelligence believes that Obama supported bump stocks.  The Republican Congress, controlled by the NRA refused to pass legislation to ban them.  Hypocrites all of you.
4338 2018-03-23 21:18:52 I don't know how many more times I need to say this. You can do that without a bump stock. You don't need anything except a finger, and an explanation. I really don't care. You can have your bump stocks. You have done zero to solve any problem whatsoever. You should start with
4339 2018-03-23 21:18:42 "The Justice Department is proposing rule changes that will effectively ban bump stocks, devices that allow semi-automatic weapons to fire like a machinegun" so my finger?
4340 2018-03-23 21:18:36 Today whom'st return the   stocks .   
4341 2018-03-23 21:18:29 1/2 Global markets were looking for direction today, a day after stocks plunged on the prospect of a global trade war. U.S President Donald Trump fired the first salvo by imposing tarrifs on at least 50 billion US dollars worth of goods being exported from China #sabcnews
4342 2018-03-23 21:18:27 Even before time travel was invented locally, orders came flooding in from the future. Patrons, often our future selves, paid us to store wine or invest in obscure stocks. We’re not sure what tipping point was reached, but soon the only order we got was to listen to better music.
4343 2018-03-23 21:18:27 I know the TX owner of the company that sells Bump Stocks is pissed with the new DOJ rulings
4344 2018-03-23 21:18:20 Obama did not legalize bump stocks. God, you lie so easily and your shrinking base is starting to realize it. You and Melania should have a very interesting break while at Mar-a-Lago.
4345 2018-03-23 21:18:11 Is today the day you decided to just throw it all away and piss off your supporters? What the hell is going on? Bump stocks? Freaking bump stocks? .00009% of the American people knew what these things were 8 months ago but now they're super bad. You're losing it Sir!
4346 2018-03-23 21:18:08 Bump stocks has be legal decades before Obama. And has only been used One Time in all of those years. Anyone that knows about them will never use one as it makes the rifle fully inaccurate and useless.
4347 2018-03-23 21:18:06 No. One. "Legalized". Bump Stocks. Stop makin shit up.
4348 2018-03-23 21:18:06 NO - bump stocks were already being SOLD when he took office.  In 2010, Obama's ATF decided, just like yours did in 2017, that they can't ban them. Republican Congress refused to write a law prohibiting them.
4349 2018-03-23 21:18:03 No they didn’t .. bump stocks were not regulated as a firearm part
4350 2018-03-23 21:18:02 Again, you make things up as you go being the pathological liar that you are. Obama didn't have the power to ban bump stocks. That would have been up the GOP congress. States control the legality of bump stocks.
4351 2018-03-23 21:17:59 Stocks fell again, thanks Trump
4352 2018-03-23 21:17:58 I can see that you don't know anything about bump stocks. Not sure how much longer I can put stock into your promises. Great disappointment.
4353 2018-03-23 21:17:57 Except for one thing. BUMP STOCKS do NOT - I repeat do NOT turn any gun into a machine gun. Wow. So what - you just woke up this morning and decided tick off everybody in your base? #WhatGives
4354 2018-03-23 21:17:52 John Barnes to ban bump stocks
4355 2018-03-23 21:17:51 NO!  Obama DID NOT legalize bump stocks like Trump just Tweeted.  The law simply did not allow Obama to prohibit bump stocks.  If congress wanted to regulate them they could have.  President Trump is WRONG! Bump stocks weren't considered an issue until after the Vegas shootings.
4356 2018-03-23 21:17:47 Any suggestions on where to learn about stocks and how to invest?
4357 2018-03-23 21:17:46 You cannot distract us, the people that supported you by talking about Obama  and bump stocks.  Despite your pitch that you were supporting our troops by signing the ridiculous budget you betrayed the US people.  You are finished with me !
4358 2018-03-23 21:17:46 Bump stocks are pretty useless except as a novelty, but I'm not willing to give the antigun people this and set a precedent for banning other things.
4359 2018-03-23 21:17:42 NO!  Obama DID NOT legalize bump stocks like Trump just Tweeted.  The law simply did not allow Obama to prohibit bump stocks.  If congress wanted to regulate them they could have.  President Trump is WRONG! Bump stocks weren't considered an issue until after the Vegas shootings.
4360 2018-03-23 21:17:40 Does this mean we should take our money out of stocks and our bank accounts!

4362 2018-03-23 21:17:36 You are so wrong on this issue. You're not preserving the #2A with this move, you're doing everything to prove it can be eroded by a thousand cuts. You are completely ignorant on bump stocks/firearms & you are fucking over the law abiding citizens. This  is a monumental bad move!
4363 2018-03-23 21:17:34 Bump stocks are in the constitution?
4364 2018-03-23 21:17:34 Bump stocks didn't need to be legalised no regulation was required they don't alter a guns internal working. Thanxs for caving in today. All racists are inherently fearful cowards. Well demonstrated President Donald.
4365 2018-03-23 21:17:31 Bump stocks should be regulated, a background check & a waiting period should be imposed, they should not be banned. The actions of a lunatic should not ruin it for the rest off the law abiding citizens & legal residents.
4366 2018-03-23 21:17:28 NO!  Obama DID NOT legalize bump stocks like Trump just Tweeted.  The law simply did not allow Obama to prohibit bump stocks.  If congress wanted to regulate them they could have.  President Trump is WRONG! Bump stocks weren't considered an issue until after the Vegas shootings.
4367 2018-03-23 21:17:21 NO!  Obama DID NOT legalize bump stocks like Trump just Tweeted.  The law simply did not allow Obama to prohibit bump stocks.  If congress wanted to regulate them they could have.  President Trump is WRONG!  Ed @EdKrassen
4368 2018-03-23 21:17:20 FAKE NEWS FROM TRUMP or what I call Trump Bull Shit - as if Obama was in league with the NRA/ what a joke /but Trump banned the bump stocks immediatgely afte the Vegas Shooting? OH TRUMP DID NOT NOW DID HE-Trump did nothing to stop them from being sold - MILLIONS SINCE VEGAS- SAD
4369 2018-03-23 21:17:15 BATF ruled bump stocks were legal in 2010 based on the Firearm Owners Protection Act signed by Ronald Reagan in 1986.
4370 2018-03-23 21:17:14 NRA gave you permission to do this as a way to help the failing weapons industry, because now there will be a run on bump stocks. Do you think no one sees through these ruses? Whatever the NRA wants/allows you & the GOP do just to keep that money flowing into your coffers.
4371 2018-03-23 21:17:14 They can have the bump stocks they can have the wall. Protect the Second Amendment. Pass a bill that says we can carry a gun in all 50 state
4372 2018-03-23 21:17:09 Obama legalized bump stocks while he was taking your guns?!
4373 2018-03-23 21:17:04 Yes the idea that bump stocks are protected by the second amendment is #unbelievable
4374 2018-03-23 21:17:02 And you aren't going to do shit about bump stocks.
4375 2018-03-23 21:17:01 How really stupid can @POTUS get? The issue isn't bumb stocks. These near future Voters are #MarchForOurLives #NeverAgain because of Assault Weapons like Military will buy w/Trillion $Dollar Deficit Budget that will also put these kids in hock on top of fearing for their lives.
4376 2018-03-23 21:16:53 Everywhere that stocks the gingerbread candle I like is sold out next year I'm stocking up on them.
4377 2018-03-23 21:16:52 Liar. Obama never legalized bump stocks. Why won't you ban assault weapons?  NRA LACKY. NO GUTS
4378 2018-03-23 21:16:51 Bump stocks are useless anyway, except for fun wasting rounds.

That’s why he did it.  He can now say he took action on gun control, while 99.9% of NRA members go... meh...whateva...
4379 2018-03-23 21:16:50 You're just repeating NRA propaganda, Not surprising since they own you. On two occasions during the Obama administration the ATF determined that it could not regulate bump stocks under the language of the current law. Not exactly legalization, is it?
4380 2018-03-23 21:16:50 I'm honestly super good with that. I think the focus of legislated regulation needs to be on semi-automatic weapons. Bump stocks were just a concession the NRA was throwing our way. If we can get that out of the way real quick, we can deal with more pressing issues.
4381 2018-03-23 21:16:44 Bump stocks are not the problem.   Very disappointing Mr. President....
4382 2018-03-23 21:16:34 Is banning bump stocks going to stop the Deep State from the black ops of mass shootings that they have been doing?
4383 2018-03-23 21:16:32 Bump stocks are single shot guns.. not machine guns
4384 2018-03-23 21:16:30 Not cool Trump, not cool. If your going to ban bump stocks, than give us suppressors. You can’t take away, without giving back. Your pissing off the people who PAYED for you Presidency!
4385 2018-03-23 21:16:26 Yo I shonuf been loosing money for the past week in these stocks smfh
4386 2018-03-23 21:16:21 Financial stocks  @BankofAmerica and @MorganStanley falling 5% apiece
4387 2018-03-23 21:16:14 Every Democratic candidate for governor supports an assault weapons ban and we are in the process of banning bump stocks and passing a red flag law.
4388 2018-03-23 21:16:13 Jesus, Mary, and Joseph!  Stop believing every damn thing they say on @foxandfriends.

No one EVER legalized bump stocks. They have simply never been banned by any law. 

Why?  Ask @SenMajLdr and @SpeakerRyan.  Gents, Care to explain to @realDonaldTrump how this one went?
4389 2018-03-23 21:16:08 Only because our very brave students came out to tell you all 
          "enough is enough." 
Otherwise you would on NEVER banned Bump Stocks. PERIOD.
4390 2018-03-23 21:16:05 That’s not even remotely true he wanted to get rid off bump stocks republicans threw a fit
4391 2018-03-23 21:16:05 A Toys R’ Us no habrá nada ni nadie que lo salve. Stocks -47% en 12 meses, $5B debt, no poseen ninguna forma de liquidación, se acabo. Están en bancarrota.
4392 2018-03-23 21:16:01 Bump stocks were banned and the budget deficit blew up, due to the massive planned parenthood funding, welfare expanding omnibus bill.  President Schumer is really executing his agenda. #omnibusbill
4393 2018-03-23 21:15:58 Obama administration did not legalize bump stocks. Do you even realizing that you're lying.  Or are you just this stupid?
4394 2018-03-23 21:15:54 TRUE: The ATF underObama concluded that bump stocks could not be regulated because they were components, not firearms. So sorta FALSE that The “Obama administration legalized bump stocks.” Nevertheless, banning bump stocks would be GOOD IDEA.
4395 2018-03-23 21:15:51 STOCKS OF INTEREST to me  for LT HOLDS. Long some of these names, always subject to change:

4396 2018-03-23 21:15:49 Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.
4397 2018-03-23 21:15:45 Smash stocks:
64=5 (now 4)
Melee=4
Brawl=3
Wii U=2
Switch=1? 
4398 2018-03-23 21:15:37 Bump stocks turn bullets into grenades, right?
4399 2018-03-23 21:15:37 Why did you support keeping bump stocks legal a year ago? Why didn’t you do anything over the past year? Why haven’t you acknowledged #MarchForOurLives
4400 2018-03-23 21:15:34 "obama is bad, trying to mess with 2nd amendment!"

"obama is bad cus they didnt ban bump stocks and do more to keep guns out of bad peoples hands!"

ok...
4401 2018-03-23 21:15:26 I don't want your "crumbs."  Banning bump stocks is throwing crumbs to shut us up.  It won't stop one person from being killed. You want to distract attention from #TrumpRussia?   #BanAssaultWeapons #MarchForOurLives
4402 2018-03-23 21:15:19 I’m pissed. 1st the Omnibus bill. Now a ban on bump stocks. WTF? Might have to re-evaluate... what’s the point of a republican congress if they don’t do anything? And Trump just abandoned his base. Perfect.
4403 2018-03-23 21:15:15 Bump stocks didnt apply in these school situations. I am not for any changes to our gun rights. FBI screwed up. Too busy looking for collusion that wasnt there to protect teens even after multiple tips/warnings yet no investigation. No gun laws should have changed! Sorry!
4404 2018-03-23 21:15:14 Second amendment is going nowhere. Bump stocks are certainly not a sacrifice.
4405 2018-03-23 21:15:12 Here’s a thought - as no member of this administration has any ethics whatsoever - any evidence @POTUS, Javanka, etc shorted stocks in recent weeks, knowing his decisions would cause a drop?
4406 2018-03-23 21:15:09 LIAR LIAR HAIR ON FIRE!! Bump stocks have been around a LOT longer than just the Obama Admin!! In 3 years they will be saying 'TRUMP ADMIN FAILED THE PEOPLE BY NOT BANNING ASSAULT WEAPONS'--  Which is TRUE! #IdiotInChief
4407 2018-03-23 21:15:09 There was never a law or an executive order that Obama signed that gave ppl the right to use bump stocks. The ATF in the admin didn’t take steps to regulate. Yet, there is an executive order that you signed allowing people with mental illnesses to have access to weapons.
4408 2018-03-23 21:14:44 Evil people with bump stocks
4409 2018-03-23 21:14:41 Per AP News... “Stocks tumble on trade fears; S&P has worst week in 2 years”. Drops 1400 in a week. 
No one to blame but Trump for this one. Stocks were doing great till he decided to do tariffs and start trade war with China.  So this is #MAGA ?
4410 2018-03-23 21:14:40 Stocks Tumble in Biggest Weekly Decline Since 2016 ,Oil surged, Euro rose, Dollar fell. what did @ProfElvanAktas do?
4411 2018-03-23 21:14:37 Bump stocks are accessories, try ditching assault weapons, universal background checks,
4412 2018-03-23 21:14:32 Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.
4413 2018-03-23 21:14:29 Not sure the DOJ can ban bump stocks...need legislation. Obama did not legalize them either.
4414 2018-03-23 21:14:22 Bump Stocks was use in Las Vegas..??? Or were they just FOUND in room..??
4415 2018-03-23 21:14:22 Attorney General Sessions proposes to amend rules to ban bump stocks. Via @Reuters
4416 2018-03-23 21:14:20 Let them ban bump stocks, no one uses them anyway, and I haven’t seen any used in a mass shooting, it won’t decrease gun crime
4417 2018-03-23 21:14:16 Liar. Obama did not approve bump stocks. "Legal experts stressed that it wasn’t an approval, but rather a determination that current law didn’t allow for its regulation" Obama's preferred policy was more gun regulation, not less, idiot. If you were a genius, you would know this.
4418 2018-03-23 21:14:15 The facts are the ATF (during the Obama administration) ruled bump stocks were legal under current law. So any order you give will be subject to a court challenge just like Obama's DACA order. So while all you're accomplishing is providing work for even more lawers.
4419 2018-03-23 21:14:14 3/ ATF, a bureau within the executive branch, decided it could not regulate bump stocks during the Obama administration.
These decisions allowed two companies to sell bump stocks. #FactsMatterPunk
4420 2018-03-23 21:13:58 Bumb stocks aren't used in a majority of these incidents.
Every shooting so far could've been stopped with the rules we have now, IT'S A RULE FOLLOWING PROBLEM NOT A PROBLEM THAT NEED MORE RULES.
4421 2018-03-23 21:13:58 DRYS and other shipping stocks.  Don't laugh.  Look at what they did from 2007 into 2008
4422 2018-03-23 21:13:55 Nobody cares, but Leftists (aka  Democrats). Won't make a scintilla difference and it's certainly not on our priority list after we were sold out today with the #SpendingBill. BUMP STOCKS are not used in shootings. You've been conned once again, or maybe PC is back in style.
4423 2018-03-23 21:13:55 Does not appear the Second Amendment gives a right to bump stocks or other accesories to firearms for that matter.
4424 2018-03-23 21:13:54 A little bit of fence money, funding for PP and now banning bump stocks  - the base must be so happy
4425 2018-03-23 21:13:52 And, it took you how long after Las Vegas to address bump stocks?  You are an abysmal excuse for a president.
4426 2018-03-23 21:13:47 So the only reason you’re banning bump stocks is this strange idea Obama “legalized” them?
4427 2018-03-23 21:13:42 Were they clear about bump stocks? Could they be fitted to muskets?
4428 2018-03-23 21:13:41 Completely agreed. But it wasn't Obama's fault that they were allowed. Existing laws were written in a way that did not include bump stocks due to their lack of mechanics. New laws were required from Congress.
4429 2018-03-23 21:13:33 He even used the word “plunges” 
4430 2018-03-23 21:13:28 Obama did not approve of bump stocks.  His determination was that current laws did not allow him ban them.
4431 2018-03-23 21:13:22 Great. How about Defunding Planned Parenthood, they kill more kids than guns with bump stocks. Oh...wait...you just gave them a crap load of blood money in that bill today.
4432 2018-03-23 21:13:22 Fine, I’ll just use my thumb, index finger & belt loop like I’ve always done. Shoot from the hip. 
They’re gimmicks and don’t create a machine gun. I know many people that have modified weapons, no bump stocks needed. 
Ya think criminals care if they can’t pass bg check?
#2A
4433 2018-03-23 21:13:19 How will this ban protect defenseless people from criminals who will continue to use bump stocks?
4434 2018-03-23 21:13:18 But I thought Obama was going to take everyone’s guns AWAY? Bump stocks aren’t a problem without the guns to use them with. Are you going to take away the guns, Donnie? Is that your plan? You can’t be a dictator if we are all armed.
4435 2018-03-23 21:13:18 The citizens should have the weapons of their government. Bump stocks helped to maintain a well-needed measure to equate civilian grade weapons to government weapons. Unfortunate our government is attempting to disarm us.
4436 2018-03-23 21:13:16 Bump Stocks do not make machine guns
4437 2018-03-23 21:13:12 Obama micromanaged EVERYTHING. Letting bump stocks go was a DOUBLE WIN for Otreason. First, he hid his true intentions up until reelection and Sandy Hook. WHY, HE WOULDN'T BAN A FLY.  Next, he WANTED us to defend against common sense - against the spirit of the law. CUNNING.
4438 2018-03-23 21:13:06 If you don't buy individual stocks, but mutual funds or whatever they call that stuff, you are buying fossil fuel, gun, pharma and other scumbag companies.
4439 2018-03-23 21:13:06 Stocks got bumped for sure @business
4440 2018-03-23 21:13:05 The Obama administration didn't "legalize" bump stocks - they were already being sold. The Obama-era ATF decided in 2010 that bump stocks did not come under their regulatory authority. The Trump-era ATF said the same thing in 2017.
4441 2018-03-23 21:12:57 Are you turning into a liberal mr president? Bump stocks are pretty much a loose glove around the trigger of the gun and the recoil of the weapon bounces back and forth with in the stock making it hit fire on its own like a turbo controller on a video game . That’s it .
4442 2018-03-23 21:12:56 Law abiding citizens don’t need need bump stocks.
4443 2018-03-23 21:12:50 Right.  I have to read the small print myself before I believe ANYTHING you say....and hey, speaking of stocks...thanks to you, the market has lost over 1,100 points in two days.
4444 2018-03-23 21:12:37 #LON:PSN 4 stocks to buy today? Centrica PLC, Persimmon plc, Just Eat PLC and WM ... #stockmarket #business #time #investing #finance #money #cryptocurrency #market #bitcoin #stocks #trading #day #daytrading #year #pennystocks #opportunities

4 stocks to buy today? Centrica …
4445 2018-03-23 21:12:34 Same here I will always support the President, but I agree with Joey it will take more than Bump Stocks right now because of this Bill that was signed! Sep. is going to need big things like Mass Deportation unfunding sanctuary cities etc. I am just saying!!!!
4446 2018-03-23 21:12:33 Nobody legalized bump stocks. You can't regulate without Congress passing a law.
4447 2018-03-23 21:12:32 Liar! Obama DID NOT legalize bump stocks.  The law simply did not allow Obama to prohibit bump stocks.  If congress wanted to regulate them they could have. You are a LIAR! Or just plain dumb. Bump stocks weren't considered an issue until after the Vegas shootings.
4448 2018-03-23 21:12:32 Obama Administration didn't  legalize bump stocks. I'M DUMB. As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns. #terrorist #bully #ftfy
4449 2018-03-23 21:12:30 The Obama Administration did not legalize bump stocks moron. A judge ruled they could not be prohibited. It's English. You may want to figure it out.
4450 2018-03-23 21:12:29 Obama was going to take our guns, now you got him legalizing bump stocks, make up your mind. See a shrink about your weird Obama’s obsession
4451 2018-03-23 21:12:27 Market Close: MBS -2bps; DOW -424.69; NASDAQ -174.01; S&P 500 -55.43; 10yr Treasury 2.82%; Stocks all retreated in deep negative territory in late day trading; while, MBS closes near unchanged.
4452 2018-03-23 21:12:24 This is true obama allowed people to acquire bump stocks !!
4453 2018-03-23 21:12:23 @EdKrassen Again, with plenty of vitriol and accusation, but not a single source for reference. Why should we believe you? Obama signed about 1 million executive orders, why not one for bump stocks? They were not invented in the last year and a half.
4454 2018-03-23 21:12:19 Obama actually did it and said it was to help physically impaired individuals use firearms easier.  Doesn't matter much, bump stocks are pretty useless (your accuracy will be nonexistent) - and you could use a belt loop to do the same thing.
4455 2018-03-23 21:12:17 Another lie.

President Obama did NOT legalize bump stocks.

Can you make it through a quarter of an hour without telling a massive whopper?

The answer appears to be no.
4456 2018-03-23 21:12:16 Bump stocks r dumb I don't care to ever have one. But this is wrong.  The left will only want more after this.
4457 2018-03-23 21:12:13 @realDonaldTrump You should stop taking NRA money & ban ALL ASSAULT rifles. NRA is a terrorist organization. You don’t need to hold meetings with them to discuss legislation.Don’t let them tell you what to do. Also, Obama NEVER took NRA money so NO he didn’t legalize bump stocks
4458 2018-03-23 21:12:12 What? Damn!  Our forefathers had bump stocks on their muskets. I’m calling the NRA. My rights have been violated. How the hell am I gonna hunt the squirrels.
4459 2018-03-23 21:12:12 Quickly summarizing (because I know those were a BUNCH of tweets), Obama actually protected the Second Amendment, BUMP STOCKS are bad, do better Mr. President.  Also, completely unrelated but Mr. President, Black Lives Matter
4460 2018-03-23 21:12:10 U really are crazy.  President Obama did not legalise bump stocks.
4461 2018-03-23 21:12:10 U.S stocks dragged by technology and banks, one of the worst weeks in more than two years
4462 2018-03-23 21:12:07 OK, that in itself is not silly but it’s more to do with responsibility as a financial journalist. If all his followers were financial planners and actuaries then fair enough. But they’re not. Just smacks of a Daily Mail front page to me
4463 2018-03-23 21:12:04 Bump stocks turn firearms into automatic firearms, which are illegal, unless they are registered with the F.B.I.
4464 2018-03-23 21:12:03 I don’t like bump stocks. I think they end up being used by the wrong people too often. But, in 2010 the ATF ruled they didn’t mean the definition of a firearm. I don’t think this move accomplishes much
4465 2018-03-23 21:12:03 The law does not permit you to do that (although I wish it did). That is why ATF under Obama could not stop the company from selling them. As I understand, since bump stocks do not alter the internal workings of the gun, they are legal. Cong. needs to pass a law banning them.
4466 2018-03-23 21:12:03 I'm pissed.... "we'll win so much you'll get tired of winning"  I'm tired of losing and hearing the excuses of the losses.  Signs the bill today and then calls bump stocks Illegal Machine Guns... WHAT !!!
4467 2018-03-23 21:12:02 Please enlighten me...which mass shootings were committed using bump stocks? After the vegas shooting there was a huge outcry for the banning of bump stocks but none were used. This doesn’t fix the epidemic. We need to understand why these mass shootings are happening.
4468 2018-03-23 21:12:00 Hey “moron” you know NOTHING about the law so here’s a lesson: since bump stocks don’t alter gun’s internal mechanisms, they were considered lawful; look, GOP lay in the blood of victims murdered by assault rifles & trying to blame Democrats will not work
4469 2018-03-23 21:11:54 RT realDonaldTrump "Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns."
4470 2018-03-23 21:11:51 No. The NRA legalized bump stocks while the Congress dithered and worried about contributions of blood money.
4471 2018-03-23 21:11:50 Obama did not approve Bump Stocks.  His administration simply found that the current LAWS did not prohibit them.  Obama was not able to make a new law because Congress wouldn't allow it.
4472 2018-03-23 21:11:49 The existing laws did not allow them to block the sale of bump stocks. That's the reason why it was still allowed. Congress would have needed to come up with new laws to be able to prevent the sale of bump stocks.
4473 2018-03-23 21:11:47 In what legislation did President Obama legalize bump stocks like trump say's, the only legislation on guns passed by President Obama was to allow people to carry weapons in National Parks , & a bill which let Amtrak passengers have guns in checked luggage.
trumps a liar !
4474 2018-03-23 21:11:45 Bump stocks have nothing to do with stocks. Comeeee on??? It’s a part of a gun!!!!
4475 2018-03-23 21:11:42 Bump stocks don't turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.  I guess you think your base will vote for you no matter what, but I can tell you, I won't make that mistake again.  I'll just stay home in 2020.
4476 2018-03-23 21:11:37 Stop worrying and buy some stocks 
4477 2018-03-23 21:11:31 No. It absolutely does not. It's quicker, with less accuracy. That is by definition the opposite of efficient. I don't care. Take your bump stocks people. All this is, is another piece of the elephant (our constitution) that's being eaten one bite at a time. Bump stocks solve 0!
4478 2018-03-23 21:11:27 Oie Can you at least get your facts straight? The Obama administration did NOT legalize bump stocks. The law did NOT allow them to prohibit. Facts matters.
4479 2018-03-23 21:11:24 Trump just tweeted "BAD IDEA" AND "BUMP STOCKS" Just saying... #endthefed
4480 2018-03-23 21:11:21 What-the-hell do you need a bump-stock device for?

And don't say hunting, target shooting, or self defense because bump-stocks are useless for all three....
4481 2018-03-23 21:11:20 As usual you have to lie even if you could tell the truth.Obama did not legalize bump stocks, they determined they could not be banned under existing laws.Which probably means you can't direct the Dept of Justice to ban them.  Laws were attempted but NRA controlled Rs stopped it.
4482 2018-03-23 21:11:16 Dude, it's Trump. Most journalists who bungle this shit have a demonstrated ability to communicate clearly and learn new things. That and most mainstream gun people don't seem to give a shit about bump stocks, or actively dislike them.
4483 2018-03-23 21:11:15 As usual,  you are W R O N G. The law did not allow Obama to prohibit bump stocks,  If Congress wanted to regulate them they could have.  #LiarLiar
4484 2018-03-23 21:11:12 Except Obama actually followed the law here. Bump stocks do not make semi automatic firearms automatic. You want to ban them fine but you have do to that legislatively.
4485 2018-03-23 21:11:10 Bump stocks are not the problem and banning them will change nothing...it’s for show. Enforce the laws we have!  Spending bill is big problem for you and republicans.
4486 2018-03-23 21:11:09 Why the hell does he continue to lie? Obama did not legalize bump stocks. #lyingpospotus

4488 2018-03-23 21:11:00 While I'm ambivalent about bump stocks, I find myself concerned at ANY more restriction than is already in place in the world of guns and ammo. I'm counting on you to protect my 2nd Amendment rights. This is one of the reasons you got my vote. Also...build the wall.
4489 2018-03-23 21:10:53 Which was wrong bumping up stocks
4490 2018-03-23 21:10:52 Obama's DOJ reviewed bump stocks and determined that they did not convert legal semi-automatic weapons into illegal automatic weapons, thus, Obama's DOJ ruled that bump stocks were legal.

But I agree, @POTUS is wrong to say they create machine guns and that he can ban them.
4491 2018-03-23 21:10:52 And no, Obama did not legalize bump stocks.
4492 2018-03-23 21:10:50 Ban the crazy people, not the bump stocks. I was with you until now.
4493 2018-03-23 21:10:49 Bump stocks were BAIT to weaken 2A.  I do my best to get people to see the big picture. Trump is very smart to see this. AR-15 platform was PUT AT RISK thanks to bump stocks.  People don't see how this works.  We are up against SOVIET-LEVEL deception with OBAMA/HOLDER.
4494 2018-03-23 21:10:43 The founding fathers never had bump stocks, and had they been able to see in the future, would never have approved of them.
4495 2018-03-23 21:10:42 This a meaningless emotional issue and gesture. Bump stocks are a novelty item. Someone prove Paddock even used them.
4496 2018-03-23 21:10:40 Wait, this morning Trump said he would veto the spending bill & lied. Now, even though the NRA has a hold on him, we are supposed to believe Trump will ban bump stocks?
4497 2018-03-23 21:10:37 Semiautomatic weapons and bump stocks enable those people to kill dozens of people in a matter of minutes. Why make it easier for them?
4498 2018-03-23 21:10:34 are you fuking kidding me?  you fuking POS, you fuk'd your base today signing that bill and you want to talk about fuking bump stocks??????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!??????????????    fuk you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4499 2018-03-23 21:10:31 Stocks dropped 1100 points in 2 days! Where is Twitter dude?
4500 2018-03-23 21:10:25 it's fed over-reach and a catering misuse of power - bump stocks do not turn rifles into machine guns...
4501 2018-03-23 21:10:21 Not when they're loaded with lies. Obama had nothing to do with bump stocks, the ATF said they were fine when they came out.
4502 2018-03-23 21:10:20 So Trump can't sign an EO to ban bump stocks but he can sign an EO to ban Dreamers, DACAs and TPS recipients.

WTF is wrong with this picture?
4503 2018-03-23 21:10:19 Ban the bump stocks. Bump stocks are not legal gun that was sold. Protect the second amendment. Drain the swamp.
4504 2018-03-23 21:10:17 OMG everything he does is a deflection. Look here so you don’t see what I did there. Like now banning Bump stocks so you forget about the disastrous budget he said he would veto but didn’t. Happy with that budget?
4505 2018-03-23 21:10:16 Well, it was a good ride while it lasted. Bad decisions make for bad outcomes. You'll be fine. The American people who voted for you and their children will pay the price for years to come. Oh, and newsflash: We could care less about you banning bump stocks. Talk about PC. Stupid

4507 2018-03-23 21:10:09 As usual, you are lying.  The ATF ruled that bump stocks could not be regulated under current law while Obama was president.
4508 2018-03-23 21:10:06 Not quite true as under the federal law during Obama Administration bump stocks could not be banned.  You really like to give half truths and lies.
4509 2018-03-23 21:10:04 Trump has done quite a few things this week to splinter his base:
1) Chinese Tariffs 
2) John Bolton
3) Signed the Omnibus Bill
4) Moved on Banning Bump Stocks

I'm going to guess that his approval rating hits a new low, maybe dipping to 29%.  He lost Ann Coulter guys.
4510 2018-03-23 21:10:02 I'm confused I thought obama was wanting to take our guns away??  Why would he legalize bump stocks just to take them away??
4511 2018-03-23 21:09:59 You are not a hero.

You are a coward, despite protestations to the contrary.  

Las Vegas was nearly SIX MONTHS AGO.  

Banning bump stocks is a bandaid.  Ban the weapons they're used on!!!!
4512 2018-03-23 21:09:57 Pretty sure the founding fathers weren't talking about bump stocks. Plus, are you really fighting for guns over children? There's something wrong with you.
4513 2018-03-23 21:09:56 Mr. President I really don't care about bump stocks because people kill people. I do care that you gave the Democrats what they wanted and made a fool out of the people that supported you.
4514 2018-03-23 21:09:54 Who cares?  Most people don't own bump stocks.
4515 2018-03-23 21:09:53 STOP LYING TO US! This is a bold-face lie and you know it!  It was, once again AS USUAL, REPUBLICANS who would not allow the banning of bump stocks because the NRA has bought and paid for most of them AND YOU so the REPUBLICANS would not allow the ban! FACTS MATTER #MORON
4516 2018-03-23 21:09:50 Quoting Politifact, “(under) the legal definition of a firearm, ATF’s (a mass BUMP STOCK manufacturer) technology chief John Spencer, determined it (BUMP STOCKS) was not regulated by law.”
4517 2018-03-23 21:09:50 @realDonaldTrump NO!  Obama DID NOT legalize bump stocks like you just Tweeted.  The law simply did not allow Obama to prohibit bump stocks.  Bump stocks weren't considered an issue until after the Vegas shootings.
4518 2018-03-23 21:09:49 Bump stocks are not the reason for killings, it's the person behind the trigger 
4519 2018-03-23 21:09:48 Good idea, but can’t you do anything without comparing yourself to our previous, far more competent President? Here’s how.  Just tweet, “Bump stocks turn legal weapons into illegal weapons, and I’m going to put an end to that.”   Done. All positive.   No negative.   Try it out.

4523 2018-03-23 21:09:40 Big deal, until you put cops in schools this does nothing.  Can keep bump stocks,  and all the other b/s if ya put cops in schools. This fixs nothing. Only makes anti-gun nuts think they won something. Then banning whatever guns used in the next school shooting. Fix the problem.
4524 2018-03-23 21:09:39 Bump stocks aren't guns and therefore aren't covered under the 2nd amendment.
4525 2018-03-23 21:09:35 Making bump stocks illegal is a no-brainer, a child could have made that decision. Should have been done immediately though. Completely irresponsible to not have gun control. Don’t care about insecure gun enthusiasts using the second amendment as an excuse to feel powerful.
4526 2018-03-23 21:09:35 I'm pissed.... "we'll win so much you'll get tired of winning"  I'm tired of losing and hearing the excuses of the losses.  Signs the bill today and then calls bump stocks Illegal Machine Guns... WHAT !!!

4533 2018-03-23 21:09:22 You just killed your base without bump stocks. You did it with a pen. I believed in you but you're just like all the rest so let the Liberals have it. I don't GAF anymore

4537 2018-03-23 21:09:15 Very true! It’s the people behind the weapon! Period! Bump stocks are garbage anyway. Waste of money. 
4538 2018-03-23 21:09:13 Lying, liar!!!!! The Obama Administration merely decided federal law at the time did not permit them to BAN bump stocks legally. 
They did impose many other restrictions which Trump immediately rolled back, like MI disqualify permit.
4539 2018-03-23 21:09:11 The Obama administration did NOT legalize bump stocks and you know it. They were unable to regulate them because the law did not permit them to prohibit it. So stop lying.

4541 2018-03-23 21:09:09 That's a fact bump stocks weren't even mentioned until the Vegas shootings but Trump is always lying when his mouth is moving I have noticed a lot.
4542 2018-03-23 21:09:08 Initially the ATF approved bump stocks and then reversed their decision in 2005.
4543 2018-03-23 21:09:08 Bump stocks were not used in Florida’s Parkland murders! The murders happened without it!
4544 2018-03-23 21:09:05 Uh gun ownership in the founders time didn't include bump stocks.
4545 2018-03-23 21:08:55 Right..I never heard of bump stocks until the Vegas shooting. #Trump blames someone else for everything!
4546 2018-03-23 21:08:54 Obama legalized bump stocks? Are you on drugs?
4547 2018-03-23 21:08:54 Where did you get that Obama's administration legalized bump stocks?!! Let me guess: you were watching fake news on Fox again?!!!!! So so tired of your lies and the lies piled on lies.

4549 2018-03-23 21:08:45 I'm all 4 ban of bump stocks but u manipulated the details in your tweet. @ that time bump stocks couldn't be regulated under the current law bcuz they didn't alter the weapon's internal mechanism & has no automatic functioning parts. Speak the whole truth!
4550 2018-03-23 21:08:44 It would take reading more than a few sentences, but if you actually could read, you would know that President Obama did NOT legalize bump stocks.  Or perhaps you do know but just like the birtherism BS this is just another lie you spout because the facts are against you.

4555 2018-03-23 21:08:36 @realDonaldTrump   ATF under Obama determined under the law they could not regulate bump stocks. He didn’t authorize them. Now the NRA is asking to ban bump stocks, you follow #NRA orders and support it. #NRAPuppet
#TickTock #ProtectMueller #MarchForOurLives #NeverAgain
4556 2018-03-23 21:08:36 The government, not trump, has finally done something right by banning bump stocks.
4557 2018-03-23 21:08:35 @realDonaldTrump Way to betray those who voted for you. In order to properly ban bump stocks you have to ban semiautomatic weapons and recoil! SAD!
4558 2018-03-23 21:08:35 I'm ambivalent on bump stocks.  They're kind of a dumb novelty, and bump firing is entirely doable without them, but the basic point is that the restriction is always the argument that bears the burden of proof. End the permission-based governance.
4559 2018-03-23 21:08:31 Facts matter, but obviously not to you, sport.  The Obama Administration DID NOT legalize bump stocks.  Question for you sport, will YOU be watching 60 Minutes this Sunday???????
4560 2018-03-23 21:08:29 Wish I had stock in Bump Stocks during this 'comment period'.
4561 2018-03-23 21:08:26 Um NO. That's not how it happened. I mean, it's good to ban bump stocks, but its NOT Obama's fault
4562 2018-03-23 21:08:25 Do you ever stop lying? No, the Obama Administration didn't legalize bump stocks.
4563 2018-03-23 21:08:24 What a hero...the NRA doesn't give a crap about bump stocks.  You are still feeding from the NRA trough.
4564 2018-03-23 21:08:24 What is the first thing Trump tweets after signing #Omnibus He tweeted about banning bump stocks. What did he lament before signing #omnibus That there was nothing in the bill for DACA. Is Trump trying to replace his base?
4565 2018-03-23 21:08:24 Bump stocks? Machine guns? Really?
4566 2018-03-23 21:08:19 Uhm, bump stocks do NOT change a semi-automatic into an automatic aka machine gun. They allow a more rapid rate of fire, but it is still one shot/trigger pull. BTW, the same effect can happen by using a belt. Will you ban belts next?
4567 2018-03-23 21:08:18 #Trump Says: Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.
4568 2018-03-23 21:08:12 The BATF issued two rulings on this, which was LEGALLY accurate.  You are the one pulling an "Obama" and not following the law.  Bump stocks DO NOT turn rifles into machine guns, that is a liberal lie.  Going to make 5 million Americans felons through bureaucratic rule?
4569 2018-03-23 21:08:12 These decisions allowed two companies to sell bump stocks. It’s important to note this was not a statement of Obama’s preferred policy, which called for more regulation of guns, but was what the agency determined it had to do under the language of current law.
4570 2018-03-23 21:08:10 Bump Stocks are not the problem. I support Trump. I don't support this legislation.
4571 2018-03-23 21:08:09 Banning bump stocks won’t stop bad people from getting them.
4572 2018-03-23 21:08:07 The Obama Administration did not legalise bump stocks. Go a day without lying. I dare you.
4573 2018-03-23 21:08:05 Ya let's blame Trump because Obama legalized bump stocks. I'm sure there's some kinda logic here that normal ppl can't see.
4574 2018-03-23 21:08:01 Trump heard the stock market crashed today. He thought the stock market was where bump stocks were sold so he posted this tweet. #ItsAlwaysObamasFault
4575 2018-03-23 21:08:00 It was your admin who legalised Bump Stocks Donnie. 

Google it!
4576 2018-03-23 21:07:58 I make calls and OWN them when I am wrong, even if for years. And I will also OWN them when #GOLD, #Silver, #Bitcoin and shorting #US stocks is working like NOW and probably a while into the future.
4577 2018-03-23 21:07:54 You are such a liar Republicans controlled Congress and could have banned bump stocks at any time

4579 2018-03-23 21:07:47 Bump stocks are not the problem...evil people are the problem. The southern border is much more of an issue than bump stocks---so is texting and driving, which is responsible for the deaths of 4,000 teens per year. Will cell phones be banned?
4580 2018-03-23 21:07:47 Bump stocks don't "turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns" they simulate automatic fire.
4581 2018-03-23 21:07:45 Cool! Then you shouldnt be too put out about bump stocks
4582 2018-03-23 21:07:45 Can you please cite the specific Executive Order issued by President Obama where he legalized “bump stocks?” I call #FakeNews.
4583 2018-03-23 21:07:45 Yeah, no. Show me the legislature or executive order, signed by Obama, that explicitly legalized bump stocks.
4584 2018-03-23 21:07:44 Wow. One thing, too bad bump stocks haven't been used in the majority of mass shootings. I agree they need to be banned but this not enough to address the systemic mass shootings our nation has become home to.
4585 2018-03-23 21:07:44 The law at the time legalized bump stocks.  The Obama Administration DID NOT legalize bump stocks.
4586 2018-03-23 21:07:43 Stoneman Douglas killer did NOT use bump stock. MUST BAN assault weapons! And speaking of "stocks" thanks for beginning to ruin the economy. Dow plunged again on (REAL) fears of trade wars you're creating. New mess! Under you BIGGEST point drops in history. #TrumpDumpBegins
4587 2018-03-23 21:07:33 Geesh... FB stocks is dropping fast... wonder if I should sell my stocks...
4588 2018-03-23 21:07:31 The Chelmsford store only stocks sizes 4-7 in every style and rarely an 8. Because "it's a small store". It has happened may times and I would like to have to opportunity to try the shoe on before ordering it or travelling to a bigger further away store.

4592 2018-03-23 21:07:20 YOU LIE!!!  The Obama Administration did not legalize bump stocks.  It DID determine that it could not legally regulate them because of the National Firearms Act of 1934.  You need new legislation to ban them, not some DOJ rule.
4593 2018-03-23 21:07:20 Read the article.  There were 2 occasions where ATF decided it could not regulate bump stocks during Obama's administration.  These decisions allowed 2 companies to sell them. NOTE: this was not a statement of Obama’s policy, which called for more regulation of guns.
4594 2018-03-23 21:07:16 Trumpian heads explode as confusion around Obama taking their guns but all approving bump stocks as they believe everything.
4595 2018-03-23 21:07:16 Baloney. Obama Admin did no such thing and while bump stocks should be banned this is insufficient to deal with crisis.  Why no call out of White Supremacists given the latest horrible incident ?
4596 2018-03-23 21:07:15 Obama espoused stricter gun regulation consistently throughout his tenure. He didn’t “legalize” bump stocks, they were already legal. Your timing is transparent and despicable. You spent a year rolling back Obama gun regs. You’re a fucking reed in the wind.
4597 2018-03-23 21:07:14 Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.
4598 2018-03-23 21:07:12 LIES totall LIES. PRESIDENT Obama's admin didnt legalize bump stocks, director of FBI clarified the law that said it didnt cover bump stocks. Thats it. And YOUR Justice Dept issuing a rule banning #bumpstocks doesnt make it law, ur skirting legislation that wld actually STOP them
4599 2018-03-23 21:07:11 Yet another broken record.  PRESIDENT Obama didn't EXPRESSLY approve bump stocks.  The law, at that time, didn't allow for it's regulation. BIG DIFFERENCE. 

Spreading lies is getting old, Donnie.
4600 2018-03-23 21:07:07 TRUMP is a LIAR. President Obama wanted to ban all assault rifles and bump stocks. Shame on you for always attacking a good moral President. You’re an embarrassment.
4601 2018-03-23 21:07:05 Considering this is a reply to @realDonaldTrump promise to ban bump stocks and more, it’s ironic in a way you didn’t expect.
4602 2018-03-23 21:07:04 The law did not allow the ATF during Obama's adminstration to prohibit the sale of bump stocks. That's a significant difference from "legalizing' them. 
That said, reducing rapid fire and increased capacity to kill needs to be acted on.
4603 2018-03-23 21:07:03 A twisting of the truth.  His administration didn't necessarily approve the manufacture and use of bump stocks, but they couldn't prohibit them either.  A law is need to be created to prohibit their manufacture and use in the U.S.

4606 2018-03-23 21:06:58 Hey, hey everybody DRINK!! @realDonaldTrump blamed Obama on bump stocks.
4607 2018-03-23 21:06:57 Let’s say he says he’s going after pharmaceutical companies for the opiate  epidemic tomorrow morning. The stocks would drop from people invested in those stocks. It’s ok. After they sell people buy back.
4608 2018-03-23 21:06:56 Another minute, another lie.  Obama did not legalize bump stocks, moron.
4609 2018-03-23 21:06:47 Get your facts straight, asshole! The Obama administration couldn’t regulate bump stocks, but would have if it was legal. @realDonaldTrump you are a total #POS and have done nothing good at all. Blame everyone else and take ZERO responsibility
4610 2018-03-23 21:06:44 They went up slowly mostly in spite of Obama policies.  Shot up in response to HRC losing GOP tax regulator policies definitely good for stocks. Protectionism is deadly. Probably would have kept going up under HRC but not nearly as much. But as I said, stick around,
4611 2018-03-23 21:06:44 1. That is a complete misrepresentation of the truth on bump stocks
2. Obama would have done something about guns if the Republicans in the House had been willing to defy their NRA paymasters and help
3. Stop spinning things to try and make Obama look bad and DO SOMETHING
4612 2018-03-23 21:06:39 Bump stocks today. Tomorrow scopes. Then slingshots.
4613 2018-03-23 21:06:39 you can't blame the Obama admin for bump stocks. Anyone I may be wrong but I don't think they needed to be made legal by
4614 2018-03-23 21:06:30 Tomorrows March isn't about Bump Stocks it's about Assault Weapons and School Safety. You are just trying to change the subject!
4615 2018-03-23 21:06:29 @realDonaldTrump how many of the bump stocks have jumped up and killed something.  NONE.  Ban the crazy people.
4616 2018-03-23 21:06:25 Confused by your statement, as you bought more today of 2 stocks at AAP with cash got from recent sales. Shouldn't we start buying selectively after S&P 8% drop caused mostly by electronic trading?
4617 2018-03-23 21:06:25 You're lying again. Obama did not legalize bump stocks. They were created during his term and Republicans blocked efforts to outlaw them.
4618 2018-03-23 21:06:21 Oh for craps sake, do you ever tell the truth? (No) Obama Admin did not legalize bump stocks!  They were already being sold. The Democrats are not to blame for DACA, you cut the cord. Just please, shut the hell up, we need to rest, we have a big march tomorrow! #MarchForOurLives
4619 2018-03-23 21:06:21 Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.
4620 2018-03-23 21:06:17 How sad is it that my grandchildren's generation no more about bump stocks, automatic rifles, and large clips that turn these into just people killers. The answer is not more guns
4621 2018-03-23 21:06:15 Responsible gun owners know that bump stocks aren't the problem. With that being said; at least our POTUS is trying to take a horrible situation and make it a bit better. It's a step. One that Obama never took.
4622 2018-03-23 21:06:10 bumpstocks distract from real stocks.
4623 2018-03-23 21:06:09 The march is about WEAPONS OF WAR. Obama did NOT legalize bump stocks
 YOU have been rolling back, including a measure that previously prevented people with mental illness from buying guns. #FakePresident Stormy Russia Cheater
4624 2018-03-23 21:06:08 Bump stocks are not the problem. You, the NRA enablers, are the problem
4625 2018-03-23 21:06:06 Feel the same way, now, the President is bragging about banning the bump stocks.
4626 2018-03-23 21:06:06 Bush admin allowed bump stocks.
4627 2018-03-23 21:06:05 I see you are fully indoctrinated with @NRA talking points, re "Obama Administration legalized bump stocks." LOL! But good idea to ban them anyway.
4628 2018-03-23 21:06:05 I feel uneasy knowing that trump has bump stocks
4629 2018-03-23 21:06:05 ANOTHER LIE! HE did NOT legalize Bump Stocks.
4630 2018-03-23 21:06:05 This is a lie. Obama's administration did not legalize bump stocks. They found that the extant laws did not permit them to ban them. BIG difference. #trumplies #trumpdisembles #trumptellsnotruth
4631 2018-03-23 21:06:01 2/ These decisions allowed two companies to sell bump stocks. It’s important to note this was not a statement of Obama’s preferred policy, which called for more regulation of guns, but was what the agency determined it had to do under the language of current law.
4632 2018-03-23 21:05:59 I get so tired of your taking every available opportunity to blame the Obama administration. Just give us the word on the bump stocks.
4633 2018-03-23 21:05:58 Where the hell does he get that Obama legalized bump stocks? Good Grief!
4634 2018-03-23 21:05:52 Wrong! Bump stocks were determined to not be regulated under the existing Firearms regulations. It wasn't legalized it was determined by the ATF to not be regulated under current law. Again he lies.
4635 2018-03-23 21:05:43 nobody gives a shit about bump stocks lucian
Stop being a drama queen
4636 2018-03-23 21:05:40 Weren’t bump stocks illegal at one point and the law expired during the Obama Administration?  Then subsequent attempts to renew it were blocked by the #GOP controlled Congress?
4637 2018-03-23 21:05:39 this isnt about banning bump stocks ...this is about banning assault rifles
4638 2018-03-23 21:05:34 Any american stock traders please chime in.. US stocks have been parabolic.. Would it crazy to think that the smart guys who get out at the top put their dollars into crypto while crypto is at a low?  #doubledown #maxprofits I think were in for a big boom this summer. $BTC @bit
4639 2018-03-23 21:05:31 Um.... It's still semi auto which means a single trigger pull per round, full auto is 1 pull and hold to empty the magazine or belt. Bump stocks cause in accurate target placing. So banning them is a waist of time. You can do the same thing by cutting the spring and stretching it
4640 2018-03-23 21:05:31 % of stocks trading above their 200DMAs plunged to 37% from 39% on Wed. Lowest close in 2 years. Bears are growling loud! #AT200 #T2107 $SPY
4641 2018-03-23 21:05:29 Nobody "legalized" bump stocks.
4642 2018-03-23 21:05:27 @realDonaldTrump some conservative. Funds Planned Parenthood abortionnmills and bans bump stocks. Loser.
4643 2018-03-23 21:05:24 Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.
4644 2018-03-23 21:05:23 Bump stocks increase rate of fire and do not change a semi automatic into a full automatic. Trump foolishly set the precedent for any implement which increases rate of fire be eligible for ban, including light weight short reset  triggers. Bump stocks are not the root cause.
4645 2018-03-23 21:05:16 Here's only doing it because the NRA who's pulling his strings is ok with banning bump stocks. Let me know when he does something that the people want and that isn't directed it okayed by either the NRA or Putin.
4646 2018-03-23 21:05:16 Bump stocks don't turn weapons into machine guns. Research it more
4647 2018-03-23 21:05:15 I'm too exhausted to get into it, but the word "approved" in "Obama approved the sale of bump stocks" is doing a TON of disingenuous lifting, but I guess it's good enough to own the libs so we'll never stop hearing it now
4648 2018-03-23 21:05:13 I don't recall bump stocks ever being illegal.  Check your facts Mr. President!
4649 2018-03-23 21:05:09 Good that they’re banning bump stocks, but the part about Obama’s admin legalizing them is pure made up shit. As usual.
4650 2018-03-23 21:05:09 AFTER he blames Obama for legalization of bum stocks which is BULLSHIT!
4651 2018-03-23 21:05:07 do much revisionist of history tweeting lately??  The Repub Congress legalized bump stocks, #Loser
4652 2018-03-23 21:05:05 That a lie he did not legalize Bump Stocks they just came out with them within the pass two years.
4653 2018-03-23 21:05:00 1/ The NRA said, "The Obama administration approved the sale of bump fire stocks on at least two occasions."There were 2 occasions in which ATF decided it could not regulate bump stocks during the Obama administration
4654 2018-03-23 21:05:00 You’re deflecting with bump stocks. You had 1 job build the wall. Bump stock is not our problem. Our problem is illegal immigration. You whiffed.
4655 2018-03-23 21:04:58 Does the average citizen really need bump stocks, I think its a fair compromise.
4656 2018-03-23 21:04:58 The Obama administration didn't "legalize" bump stocks - they were already being sold. The Obama-era ATF decided in 2010 that bump stocks did not come under their regulatory authority. The Trump-era ATF said the same thing in 2017. - Daniel Dale
4657 2018-03-23 21:04:54 Why are you talking about this now?  Do you think the Libs or dems are gonna start liking and voting for you? OK bump stocks are bad. But so is not building your wall and not using your main power over congress the veto.
4658 2018-03-23 21:04:48 Just be happy that he banned the stocks butter cup
4659 2018-03-23 21:04:48 This has to do with your hatred and jealousy of Obama. If Obama had made bump stocks illegal, you would legalize them.
4660 2018-03-23 21:04:48 Not that the front & center, no one wants to "own" bump stocks. It's like kids blaming each other for the glass of milk that got turned over.
4661 2018-03-23 21:04:48 Obama didn't legalize the Bump Stock.  Read your fact.  The law at the time didn't allow Obama to regulate bump stocks.  There is a huge difference. -EK
4662 2018-03-23 21:04:47 banning bump stocks won't eliminate slaughter of Americans however it has now been 6 months since Vegas massacre, you're still looking while millions more are purchased. Congress could have passed quick legislation but you decided to handle as a regulatory matter per NRA request.
4663 2018-03-23 21:04:44 Hey little Donnie bump stocks do not turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns. You still have to have a trigger pull each time. You can do this with a piece of rope or your trousers belt. You are sounding like a liberal more and more each day. @realDonaldTrump
4664 2018-03-23 21:04:42 You don’t get it both ways. Did Obama try to take away guns or did he legalize bump stocks? Make up you mind. Your hypocrisy shows that you are stupid lazy and have no direction or consistency.
4665 2018-03-23 21:04:40 Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.

4667 2018-03-23 21:04:33 Bump stocks can be produced illegal to turn a gun into a machine gun. Like as if the user of a bump stock cares about law or life's to begin with. The automatic riffles need to be banned. The bump stocks can be legal all the way than.
4668 2018-03-23 21:04:29 Well even the NRA says that Bump Stocks need to regulated or even banned.   I know veterans that support that side of it as well.
4669 2018-03-23 21:04:27 Canada stocks lower at close of trade; S&P/TSX Composite down 0.98%
4670 2018-03-23 21:04:23 There you go, lying again.  The Obama administration found there was no law regulating bump stocks, therefore they were legal (remember, stuff is legal until ruled otherwise).  Going after bump stocks is a red herring anyway, why not deal with the real issues?
4671 2018-03-23 21:04:20 Obama did not approve bump stocks, the law didn't allow for banning them, big difference...Liar in Chief

4675 2018-03-23 21:04:13 Can u please stop fucking lying so much, what fucking congress would sign a bill to legalize bump stocks shithole?
4676 2018-03-23 21:04:12 No they didn't! They were already being sold; the Obama-era ATF stated in 2010 that bump stocks did not come under their regulatory authority.  And Trump-era ATF said the same thing in 2017. #ConManDon

4679 2018-03-23 21:04:11 Same reason we over indulge in everything else In America, we make cars that go faster than the speed limit but don’t ask why. Bump stocks when used within the law just like fast cars are for entertainment and experience purposes.
4680 2018-03-23 21:04:08 Maybe they should have taught you how to spell.

You can "BUY" stocks whenever, you just have to make sure you sell them for more than what you purchased them for ... or is this something else (other than grammar) not taught at Trump University?
4681 2018-03-23 21:04:08 Bump stocks do not modify a weapon’s trigger nor make it fire automatically with a “single function.” Rather, they use the natural recoil of a gun to bounce the weapon off the shooter’s shoulder and back onto his or her trigger finger.
4682 2018-03-23 21:04:07 Worrying about bump stocks when you just signed a 1.3 trillion Omnibus spending bill is  like worrying about jay walking when the Titanic is sinking! The do-nothing Democrats won today!
4683 2018-03-23 21:04:06 Trump administration obstructed justice and grafted the nation. Your party wouldn’t let them ban 5.56 and m855 ammo under obama and bump stocks were falsely stated to be an aid to the handicap. So blow me
4684 2018-03-23 21:04:02 Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.
4685 2018-03-23 21:03:57 Every chance you get to give Obama a dig you do it!  This week has been a cluster f*ck for you. You proved to even your deplorable base what a poor negotiator you are. Banning Bump stocks isn't going to cut it Donny!  You can't afford any more bad weeks.  #NotMyPresident #resign
4686 2018-03-23 21:03:55 From PolitiFACT:

Bump stocks harness a weapon’s recoil to cause the user’s finger to squeeze the trigger repeatedly, but because they don’t alter the gun’s internal mechanisms, they were considered lawful.

Obama didn't legalize them.  Again, you distort fact.
4687 2018-03-23 21:03:54 I am pretty sure more people have died by having stones thrown at them than bump stocks
4688 2018-03-23 21:03:48 Bump stocks didn't kill all those kids at Parkland President Douchebag.  Deflect deflect deflect.  #AStormyIsAComing!!!
4689 2018-03-23 21:03:47 Absolutely no reason to ban bump stocks, any thing can be used or made to bumpfire! Even just a finger!!!
4690 2018-03-23 21:03:37 Laughed at "Obama administration legalized bump stocks."
4691 2018-03-23 21:03:30 Bump fire stocks not good can break the bolt carrier and destroy the gun no accuracy for hunting or target practice barrel get hot and unmanageable the good thing of AR 15 is that small and even weak people can shoot it but modified not
4692 2018-03-23 21:03:29 Just read Trump’s remark about banning bump stocks. He stated that bump stocks turn rifles into illegal guns like machine guns . Is he right

No?

4697 2018-03-23 21:03:22 Aren't you going to fact check POUTS?! The ATF’s technology chief John Spencer determined bump stocks was not regulated by law in 2010.

HE DIDN'T APPROVE OF THEM - he said their was no law regulating them.

4700 2018-03-23 21:03:16 Bump stocks weren't used in Parkland, dotard.

4702 2018-03-23 21:03:10 OMG can ever not lie?
Obama did not legalize bump stocks.  You are completely OBSESSED with him.
4703 2018-03-23 21:03:02 Did not read the article but I bet he says, “don’t panic, stocks are cheaper so buy more, not all at once, over time.”
4704 2018-03-23 21:03:02 Never mind the only thing he shared was that he's getting rid of bump stocks he's throwing us a bone
4705 2018-03-23 21:02:55 tRump is still running scared. We The People want a President that is responsive NOT reactive. This latest diversionary tactic will NOT dissuade the students! Get rid of Assault Rifles but yeah we’ll take the demise of bump stocks too! (You know along w/ your resignation)
4706 2018-03-23 21:02:54 Today trump said he’s for banning “bump stocks “. Bump stocks were not used at the Florida parkland murders!
4707 2018-03-23 21:02:52 You don’t need bump stocks for hunting or self defense. There only purpose is to skirt the law. America is a nation of laws
4708 2018-03-23 21:02:51 Stop lying.  Obama administration did not "approve" bump stocks.  That was on the books already.  And if that (worthy) administration attempted to ban them (pre Las Vegas) the NRA would have melted down.  #stoplying

4710 2018-03-23 21:02:48 These decisions allowed two companies to sell bump stocks. It’s important to note this was not a statement of Obama’s preferred policy, which called for more regulation of guns, but was what the agency determined it had to do under the language of current law.
4711 2018-03-23 21:02:48 He's banning bump stocks today. Just give it up today.
4712 2018-03-23 21:02:48 Therefore? He's banning bump stocks from making legal guns turn into machine guns

4715 2018-03-23 21:02:34 Are using bump stocks to deflect from this awful bill you signed, that increases our debt? Democrats and republicans are bankrupting America!
4716 2018-03-23 21:02:34 Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) price at close, 2018-03-23, is 301.54.
4717 2018-03-23 21:02:34 That’s a lie.  (Is anyone surprised?) At the time, bump stocks were considered legal because there was no law to limit it.  Not saying they should be legal, but making the claim that Obama got out a pen and proclaimed 2012 the year of the bump stock as he signed bill is a lie.
4718 2018-03-23 21:02:33 Obama did NOT legalize bump stocks. ATF under him concluded they couldn't ban them without Congress, and Republicans blocked any new legislation. Your ban will almost certainly fail in the courts for the same reason.

Are you consciously lying, or do you just not know the truth?
4719 2018-03-23 21:02:31 Pretty sure you can probably count on one hand the amount of times a bump stock has been used in a crime. Banning of bump stocks just affects law-abiding citizens who want to have a little bit of fun. Have any pro-gun ideas? Worst day for #2ndAmendmentRights in a long long time
4720 2018-03-23 21:02:30 Nice try Don the Con but it was the ATF who found that it didn't violate the Gun Control Act or the National Firearms Act. Since there was no law that curtailed the sale of Bump stocks it was up to Congress!
4721 2018-03-23 21:02:28 The Obama Administration took the position that existing law did not give it the authority to regulate bump stocks.

If they had taken the opposite position, gun nuts would be screeching about executive overreach.
4722 2018-03-23 21:02:28 Exactly.  It is silly to think Obama wanted bump stocks to be legal.
4723 2018-03-23 21:02:23 They didn’t legalize bump stocks. People in his administration came to the conclusion they were already legal under current laws. You had to throw a jab. And, shocker, it’s a lie.
4724 2018-03-23 21:02:22 Dude. Are you really trying to say Obama was more pro gun than you? The NRA gave you 30M and now this is the compromise? Bump stocks?
4725 2018-03-23 21:02:20 Technically bump stocks don’t turn semi automatic rifles into automatic rifles or machine guns. The firing mechanism is still the same and you still have to pull the trigger for every time you want to release a a round. Bump stocks just allow you to pull the trigger really fast.
4726 2018-03-23 21:02:20 Not sure why @PolitiFact rated this as "mostly true".  Finding that the ATF said it could not regulate bump stocks because it did not fall within their scope of regulation does not mean "approve".

4733 2018-03-23 21:02:04 According to professionals on the subject, bump stocks were NOT used in Las Vegas. That was full on automatic weaponry fire. Why don’t you yell us what really happened??
4734 2018-03-23 21:02:01 Once again you're demonstrating your stupidity--or is it mendacity--and cowardice. So-called bump stocks do not turn legal weapons into machine guns. You're just going whichever way the wind blows, just as you did with the omnibus monstrosity.
4735 2018-03-23 21:01:56 You better ban belt loops than!!! Lol!!! Bump stocks belong in the garbage anyway.
4736 2018-03-23 21:01:51 Bump stocks were used in Vegas shooting...nice to see you're on top of everything. LOSER.  Try and keep up grandpa, The kids don't care about bump stocks, they want you to ban assault rifles.  Maybe after a few more shootings you will catch up.
4737 2018-03-23 21:01:51 OBAMA ADMINISTRATION LEGALIZED BUMP STOCKS. BAD IDEA. AS I PROMISED, TODAY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WILL ISSUE THE RULE BANNING BUMP STOCKS
4738 2018-03-23 21:01:49 That's a flat out lie from @POTUS. Bump stocks were legal in 49 states since CA banned them in 1990 and all 50 before then. And friggin' @MSNBC just read that tweet on air and did not note that huge lie.
4739 2018-03-23 21:01:48 .@realDonaldTrump tweets that @TheJusticeDept will issue a rule today that moves to ban bump stocks: "We will ban all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns."
4740 2018-03-23 21:01:48 Apple Inc (AAPL) price at close, 2018-03-23, is 166.29.
4741 2018-03-23 21:01:48 Not true, there never was legislation in place or offered to regulate or legalize bump stocks.
4742 2018-03-23 21:01:47 By those words bump stocks are completely legal. One bang per trigger pull.
4743 2018-03-23 21:01:42 Guessing the manufacturers of bump stocks aren’t in your back pocket- or vice versa. A very minimal effort. What about the actual guns use in mass shootings, huh?

4745 2018-03-23 21:01:32 Maybe Obama understood bump stocks weren't the real problem. Getting rid of bump stocks isn't going to change a thing. Except punish and limit the rights and choices of laws of abiding citizens. Bombs are outlawed but did that stop the Texas bomber? Criminals do follow the laws.
4746 2018-03-23 21:01:32 not as much about bump stocks
4747 2018-03-23 21:01:28 Microsoft Corp (MSFT) price at close, 2018-03-23, is 88.3.
4748 2018-03-23 21:01:28 ...and you signed a bill allowing persons with mental illness to buy guns. The March is not about bump  stocks.
4749 2018-03-23 21:01:27 Probably the best day to come out against bump stocks.  There's a whole lotta people ticked off after that spending bill signed! LOL

4753 2018-03-23 21:01:20 Sorry Mr President, who cares about bump stocks after what you did to all of us supporters today?
4754 2018-03-23 21:01:14 No. I look at the best quarter performing sectors and select the strongest stocks within the sector.
4755 2018-03-23 21:01:10 Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.
4756 2018-03-23 21:01:08 Because bump stocks didn't alter the gun’s internal mechanisms, they  were considered lawful. This wasn't Obama’s policy, which called for  more regulation of guns, but was what the ATF determined it had to do under current law at that time.
4757 2018-03-23 21:01:06 despite your stupid and constant berating of Obama, banning bump stocks is a good idea-it's SOMETHING-hope it sticks
4758 2018-03-23 21:01:06 *Obama administration didn’t ‘Legalize’ BUMP STOCKS. They only recognized that they’re not something the government should be regulating or BANNING.
4759 2018-03-23 21:01:04 Stop lying, the Obama administration did not call bump stocks legal. Wanted congress to act because ATF doesn't have authority to regulate rifle stocks.
4760 2018-03-23 21:01:04 Ever been to a competition?  Why do they need to shoot faster?  Every shooter thrives for speed and accuracy. I couldn't care less about bump stocks. I do t even own one. Point is, it does nothing to solve anything. So, why take more away from those of us who abide the law
4761 2018-03-23 21:01:02 Thinks: how can I find a way to blame Obama—instead of the NRA and all the GOP politicians they've bought—for all the gun deaths? Yay! He legalized BUMP STOCKS. Sort of. OK, not at all. Nevermind, my base will believe whatever I tell them... #NRAMorons #GunsKillPeopleStoopid
4762 2018-03-23 21:01:01 LIE. The Obama Admin under law in place at that time -  @GOP refused to change - allowed bump stocks & Pres Obama did not have authority to stop sales. The law you just signed changes that.

4766 2018-03-23 21:00:53 Bump stocks are not the problem. People (crazy people) are the problem. Banning legal products will never be the answer. Think back to your and my time ... we take God out of schools and place kids in front of devices that require NO exercise and wonder what the problem is ...
4767 2018-03-23 21:00:49 It speaks to your level of intelligence that you want people to believe that bump stocks are the problem here. We are not your Deplorables! Even they done believe the BS...

4769 2018-03-23 21:00:48 They didn't legalize bump stocks you idiot, and you rolled back tons of EOs that provided common sense gun control. BLOOD IS ON YOUR HANDS
4770 2018-03-23 21:00:47 You pissed off your supporters by signing the bill today (after pretending you wouldn't), saying you support DACA, hurting red states with your tariffs and now you want to ban bump stocks. 

MAGA do you see now he is a liar and played you all???
4771 2018-03-23 21:00:44 Are they going to have a buy back program for bump stocks or fine the manufacturers????Of course not!!!

4775 2018-03-23 21:00:41 They're not machine guns. They're the same gun as before. Also, if you're going to ban bump stocks you might as well band my belt loop because it does the same exact thing
4776 2018-03-23 21:00:37 so why not get rid of the bump stocks and the evil  people will have one less weapon
4777 2018-03-23 21:00:36 again you get it wrong. They tried to make them illegal and were blocked. Also, the march tomorrow isn't about bump stocks - it's about a lot more than that.
4778 2018-03-23 21:00:34 AG Sessions proposes today to ban #bumpstocks. DOJ is publishing for public comment a proposed rule that would define machine gun to include bump stocks and would effectively ban them.
4779 2018-03-23 21:00:33 But Planned Parenthood you just signed a bill killing more with your signature than bump stocks

4781 2018-03-23 21:00:29 Fake News - Obama did NOT approve Bump Stocks.  Due to @GOP lack of responsibility & accepting #NRA Blood Money & not passing a law [due to @BarackObama being President] the Bump Stocks were not prohibited.  Get your facts straight!
4782 2018-03-23 21:00:26 No, they did not do any such thing. What the Obama administration did do was determine that they had no legal jurisdiction over bump stocks. Nice try, dummy.
4783 2018-03-23 21:00:21 The original sales pitch heard by ATF was that bump stocks allowed wounded retired soldiers to use a weapon as part of therapy even if they'd lost one of their arms / hands. Nothing was said of the automatic fire capabilities these stocks provide.

4785 2018-03-23 21:00:18 You moron it’s not about bump stocks it’s about Military machine guns. We know what the problem is even if you don’t. You can’t hide from this. We are in Palm Beach and we will be in your backyard
4786 2018-03-23 21:00:14 It was such a tragedy when those kids were killed by bump stocks!
4787 2018-03-23 21:00:11 Still stocks do that. They go up and down. I mean that’s basic stuff
4788 2018-03-23 21:00:04 This is not what you promised Mr. President. Banning bump stocks is a violation of the 2nd Amendment. The problem is not the weapon, but the nutcase using it to harm others. #unbelievable

4790 2018-03-23 20:59:59 What happened at Parkland high school had nothing to do with bump stocks. After the shooting in Las Vegas you had an opportunity to do something about bump stocks and did nothing. Typical out of touch loud mouth, trying to divert attention.
4791 2018-03-23 20:59:58 Do your research.... For a gun to be considered automatic the trigger mechanism has to be the factor... Bump stocks do not alter trigger mechanisms...
4792 2018-03-23 20:59:57 Where do you get your reading material? "Bump stocks" do not turn 'any' gun into a "machine gun". What a bad day you are having! First no veto and now this? You are working overtime 'NOT' to get reelected.
4793 2018-03-23 20:59:57 Bump stocks are low hanging political fruit. That way you can tell those kids tomorrow that you are doing something. The NRA isn’t going to sue over bump stocks. Really a half assed effort. I thought you weren’t a politician?  There are 32 million reasons not ban assault rifles.
4794 2018-03-23 20:59:56 But your buddies at Breitbart stated recently that bump stocks are “for novelty, not for accuracy.”

Quit trying to manipulate the news.
4795 2018-03-23 20:59:44 ho gives a shit about bump stocks? They don’t turn guns into machine guns, you troglodyte.

You just lit #MAGA on fire & this is your follow up?

You gave Congress a pay raise, funded Planned Parenthood and walls in Jordan, but not 1 dime for our border wall.

Enjoy impeachment.
4796 2018-03-23 20:59:43 Joey. There has never been a more perfect day to announce the banning of bump stocks.
4797 2018-03-23 20:59:34 Obama's administration did not "legalize" bump stocks. They ruled that it is not a firearm or firing mechanism so it is not something the ATF could regulate. Stop spreading #FakeNews
4798 2018-03-23 20:59:28 What the fuck? Obama didn't legalize bump stocks

4800 2018-03-23 20:59:27 Yeah because some guy who wears a gun for his job of enforcing security is totally the same as the gun enthusiast who stocks up on ammo and assault rifles so he can parade downtown with them because it's "his right", correct?
4801 2018-03-23 20:59:26 President Obama didn't approve Bumb stocks he tried to get rid of it and congress wouldn't pass the bill
4802 2018-03-23 20:59:25 Trump says "the Department of Justice will issue  rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns" NRA says will support ban but not legislation. Huh?

4807 2018-03-23 20:59:18 A beginning to a bad idea.  Give an inch - you might give a mile next.  Bump stocks are not going to help but actually make worse in what comes next.  Love Donald - agree mostly with his decisions, but this one is bad!
4808 2018-03-23 20:59:14 Stop lying. The Obama Administration did not legalize bump stocks. It decided it could not regulate bump stocks. It’s important to note this was not a statement of Obama’s preferred policy, which called for more regulation of guns.
4809 2018-03-23 20:59:13 Republicans legalized bump stocks, not Obama. Why don’t you for once not make this political with lies. Just do the right thing because it’s the right thing to do.

4811 2018-03-23 20:59:09 Dude I’m going to try to explain this very simply. Donald Trump is tweeting about his plan to make a gun accessory called bump stocks illegal. A bump stock is an accessory that will modify a semi automatic weapon and turn it into an automatic weapon

4814 2018-03-23 20:59:01 The Obama admin approved the sale of bump stocks on two occasions because the law didn't permit regulation of bump stocks. They were not legalized by the Obama admin.

FYI a belt loop can perform the same function
4819 2018-03-23 20:58:54 See. You can't stop evil. That's the point. A bump stock being banned isn't going to save anyone's life. In fact, bump stocks are incredibly less accurate. I'm sure you already knew that though.
4820 2018-03-23 20:58:51 Your statement is a lie . THe DOJ under Obama was forced to rule that bump stocks did not meet the criteria. He EO many other matter of control that you have reversed. The NRA was going to sue so Obama passed. Wished he had not . But you can't say a word.  NRA owns you
4821 2018-03-23 20:58:50 #BanAssaultRifles. Bump stocks should of been banned with the Las Vegas Shooting you #MORON. Bump Stocks had nothing to do with recent shootings.

4824 2018-03-23 20:58:46 Actually, bump stocks turn ARs into chain fed gas powered machine guns
4825 2018-03-23 20:58:45 This is a gross mischaracterization of the facts. In the meantime you are outlawing bump stocks, which were only used in the Las Vegas massacre but passing on semi-automatics that are used in virtually every school shooting...take a stand you miserable excuse for a POTUS
4826 2018-03-23 20:58:41 "But there’s a reason the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms concluded it couldn’t ban bump stocks under Obama, who was no friend of the gun lobby: bump stocks don’t appear to violate federal law."
4827 2018-03-23 20:58:32 I say undo everything Obama did, no matter what it was. He was an illegal president from the beginning. 
But banning bump stocks isn't going to solve the problem. It's the mass murder pills they give to these boys, it's the fatherless homes, it's the no discipline at home.
4828 2018-03-23 20:58:30 So who was it who whispered "Legalizing bump stocks was Obama's idea, you know" in his ear to get him to do this?

4830 2018-03-23 20:58:27 No, the law prohibited them from regulating bump stocks, which is vastly different than “legalizing” them. You routinely  criticize President Obama for over-regulating and now you’re criticizing the fact that his admin couldn’t regulate these? Can’t have it both ways. Grow up!
4831 2018-03-23 20:58:26 He’s been pretty vocal on bump stocks actually. I don’t really like it, it’s good for people with RA (like pistol grips). Sure, some people abuse them, but they actually decrease accuracy, so usually only someone with hand issues would want one.
4832 2018-03-23 20:58:24 Wasn’t it ATF who said there was no law to prohibit the sale of BUMP STOCKS?

4836 2018-03-23 20:58:16 Actually this is just another false & misleading statement. In actuality, in 2010 ATF decided that "bump stocks" were considered a "part" and therefore could not be regulated as a firearm. Just more of your misdirection bullshit.

While Bump stocks harness a weapon’s recoil causing user’s finger to squeeze the trigger repeatedly, they don’t alter internal mechanisms. Therefore they were considered lawful. No regulation needed.
4841 2018-03-23 20:57:54 You lie with every breath that you take. Obama did not legalize bump stocks.
4842 2018-03-23 20:57:48 No they didn’t. The ATF correctly interpreted existing law, which bump stocks were invented to circumvent LEGALLY. @NRA fought to prevent those laws from adapting.

4845 2018-03-23 20:57:37 They didn't legalize bump stocks. They aren't regulated under Gun Control Act/National Firearms Act. So the law in place didn't allow to make them illegal. So no, quit LYING...AGAIN.

4858 2018-03-23 20:57:12 The right is to bear arms. Meaning you can carry a gun, and it must be visible. 2nd amendment says nothing about what kind of stock you can put on it.

I'm all for the second amendment but bumps stocks are way beyond "keeping and bearing."
4859 2018-03-23 20:57:10 Your an idiot. Republicans reversed assault style ban and refused to ban bump stocks. That is public record. You look dumber every time you open your mouth

4861 2018-03-23 20:57:08 Part 1 is a lie. He did not approve or legalize bump stocks. In June 2010 the NRA sent a letter to ATF asking for clarification on the legal status of bump stocks.  Since it did not meet the legal definition of a firearm it was not regulated.  You lie whenever you breath
4862 2018-03-23 20:56:59 You’re a LIAR Donnie. Obama did not legalize bump stocks. You will go down as the worst president ever!! #worstpresidentever

4864 2018-03-23 20:56:53 This is not true and banning bump stocks and nothing else is beyond weak. It's the "NRA approved" softball remedy.
4865 2018-03-23 20:56:53 Law abiding citizens DO have the right to own bump stocks. Just like law abiding citizens DO have the right to own weapons. Let’s be clear, this argument shouldn’t be about pro-gun/anti-gun. It’s about gun CONTROL!

4980 2018-03-23 20:53:43 Speaking of stocks, market is 690 points down. That your doings?
4981 2018-03-23 20:53:37 I’m sure criminals will obey all gun laws and will never be able to buy bump stocks.

oh, hmm.
4985 2018-03-23 20:53:28 I would hazard a guess that MOST people let them roll up as equities tend to be a longer term investment. Silly argument to defend a silly initial comment

4987 2018-03-23 20:53:25 Seriously disappointed deplorable here. I don't think you should have signed that omnibus, and bump stocks are not a problem because one idiot used them. The problem is too many Democrats owning guns and uneducated people not knowing about guns

4989 2018-03-23 20:53:24 Most stocks are down today so unless you can isolate for this move I doubt citi is worried.
4990 2018-03-23 20:53:20 After all @realDonaldTrump's trash talking about stocks and the economy, his tariffs sure aren't sending the stock markets any higher.
4991 2018-03-23 20:53:20 From a supporter of yours.   How could you talk about bump stocks, is this a complete diversion of your “cave in” today? I elected you to change the ways things were done, and you sank into the swamp.  I still support you, however i feel you lost quite of bit of your own today.

5008 2018-03-23 20:52:58 1. Government makes things illegal. By default, any thing is "legal"
2. Bump stocks don't turn semi auto into auto- no change to weapon.
5009 2018-03-23 20:52:57 Why? He's banning bump stocks that Obama legalized.
5010 2018-03-23 20:52:56 Las Vegas was a tragedy.  But of all the other mass shootings in the last 20 years how many used bump stocks?  This is a lip service ban that will have minimal effect.

5078 2018-03-23 20:45:32 Stocks dropped again Friday afternoon as fears of an escalating trade conflict between the U.S. and China rattled investors around the world. U.S. indexes had their worst week in two years.
5079 2018-03-23 20:45:16 I keep hearing invest in stocks buy Gold and Silver ! Why? They work together one way or another . So don’t invest or buy. The Rich will suffer a big lost . Like they are making you do now when you buy. They sale it and you lose it !
5080 2018-03-23 20:44:01 I think more and more guys know they aren't NBA caliber and is okay leaving early to go to Europe. A lot of stocks can't get much higher with some players. Like Mika from BYU.
5081 2018-03-23 20:44:00 Yes, but these are still the 100 biggest and leavers even worse performers/new ones on a growth trajectory? What's the all share movement over same period I wonder. Don't get me wrong, I like equities but do think it's interesting.
5082 2018-03-23 20:43:37 One thing I learned when new to trading was that staring at your screens and cheering your stocks on DOESN’T WORK !!! Work on reducing market noise from a psychological perspective.
5083 2018-03-23 20:43:22 Get those stocks in order. I sense a crash coming on.
5084 2018-03-23 20:43:03 It is very easy to make a lot of money very quickly when you buy the leading stocks after a correction. Don't get chopped up trying to pick the bottoms, let the battle playout and only wade in when you think you know which side will win.
5085 2018-03-23 20:42:57 Many people let them roll up. Any accumulation share class reinvests all the dividends.
5086 2018-03-23 20:42:56 There is also the question of weighting and the disproportionate impact one or two very large cap stocks have on the index e.g. BP/Deepwater Horizon

5091 2018-03-23 20:41:28 Consensus (or weak hands if you wish) appears to be long stocks and, bizarrely, long USD and short oil. Fascinating to see oil rally and USD get smoked into an equity crash. Clearly a new regime for the dollar, the old “risk off” = “buy dollar” rule seems not to apply.
5092 2018-03-23 20:41:12 When the stock market goes down that means stocks are cheap.  I just keep buying more.
5093 2018-03-23 20:41:11 Or spent them as many do. They see investment as an income stream.
5094 2018-03-23 20:40:58 Stocks continue to fall with looming fear of trade war -425 on the DOW today putting it well over 1000 in two days. Facebook and Twitter stocks plunge, and a tech company sell off begins. Thoughts? #Marketcrash
5095 2018-03-23 20:40:47 Do not buy which everyone is buying, sell on good news and buy good stocks on bad news. Stop following these fund managers, you will make money 1 time and loose 9 times.
5096 2018-03-23 20:40:43 And there’s no need to guess I recall ftse itself has a list of all time members. There are more than 250 on it as I recall. But with splits and buys and takeovers it gets complicated.
5097 2018-03-23 20:40:29 I thought they traded like a bag of shit bearing in mind the carnage in stocks. Maybe it's the supply next week, but if we get a series of bad auctions, we're gonna get the perfek storm where stocks & bonds both take it up the wazoo

5103 2018-03-23 20:39:20 So stocks dropping over a thousand points in a matter of days multiple times in the past few months is good for the economy right?
5104 2018-03-23 20:39:10 bronze marth challenges me, wins neutral 1/5 times, still gets last stock game 1 and only loses by 2 stocks game 2, tells ME the mu is trash rofl

it might be, but in this instance.. you need to get better, sorry
5105 2018-03-23 20:39:06 Congrats! Do you only run the biggest % gainer on STT? When I find stocks on STT it's always to late in the move...
5106 2018-03-23 20:38:29 Crypto And Foreign Currency Has Opened A Shit Load Of New Doors For Me. Already Investing In Real Estate, Stocks And Starting My Online Business. Yet Still Not Comfortable 
5107 2018-03-23 20:38:23 I would like to know how long a single country can run a huge annual trade deficit before the other countries put a stop to it. The only use for their USD is to either buy US bonds and stocks, companies, and property - until we run out of things to sell.
5108 2018-03-23 20:38:21 Wow. That was emotional. My family is Navy & Army and supports getting rid of military style weapons, background checks, end to gun show loop holes, ban on bump stocks and limiting magazines because it's common sense. And don't try the hunting argument. I grew up in rural PA.
5109 2018-03-23 20:37:48 Does he have to negotiate with the dems to fulfill his most important campaign promise and begin arresting traitors and those who deal in children like stocks?
5110 2018-03-23 20:37:25 Il faut gérer les stocks avant les renouvellements... Svp...
5111 2018-03-23 20:37:06 You said if I’d bought, so I thought you were talking about returns.
5112 2018-03-23 20:37:00 Trump is trying to crash the market so Putin and his buddies can buy stocks at a lower rate.
5113 2018-03-23 20:37:00 The dollar is generally weak, the (South African) gold stocks are significantly higher for the week, it partly suggests a "risk-on" attitude (Internationally), the Top 40 Index which is dominated by the rand hedges is down for the week, indicating confidence to the local economy.
5114 2018-03-23 20:36:58 Folks who are suggesting to tune out what Washington DC people are up to, do they need to be reminded that you can’t simply turn a blind eye to the depreciation of your underlying assets?! #Trading #Stocks #TradeWar $DJI $COMPX $AAPL $FB $NKE $CAG
5115 2018-03-23 20:36:48 well, we might get our war!

I've told my wife - If stocks go to zero, we have more things to worry about than our portfolio.
5116 2018-03-23 20:36:40 おうち出たので西友で飲み物買って待ってます
5117 2018-03-23 20:36:33 I guess about 50 out of the 1999 one hundred have been replaced by another 50, so comparison is apples with pears
5118 2018-03-23 20:36:30 When stocks fall you can by them and then you can sell them after they go up. Or dont they teach that in those liberal colleges? SHEESH!!
5119 2018-03-23 20:36:23 Stocks are dropping. #MAGA ... whatever
5120 2018-03-23 20:36:20 You do know that the money lost didn't really exist? It was stocks.
5121 2018-03-23 20:36:00 He also tanked stocks because of his stupid as fuck trade war with China. lowest since he was elected.

He makes all the best deals. Bullshit.
5122 2018-03-23 20:35:56 Les boulettes de Mandanda yen a un stocks....
5123 2018-03-23 20:35:55 Lmao where’s the stocks for sale? Can’t seem to find them
5124 2018-03-23 20:35:53 ふつうに島袋さん終わったら涅槃に入りたい
5125 2018-03-23 20:35:18 What a fukin time to be alive , Man Utd to win the league on Facebook likes, Liverpool champions of Europe on coach greetings & flare stocks #fuckityfuckfuck
5126 2018-03-23 20:35:05 Nuh-uh. Plastic stocks are inherently more lethal. That's what I heard anyway.
5127 2018-03-23 20:34:48 Yeah he said a few days ago he was bullish in stocks.
5128 2018-03-23 20:34:46 おけい
5129 2018-03-23 20:34:27 rates actually trade incredibly well when you consider stocks just dropped over 5% in 48 hours.
5130 2018-03-23 20:34:01 Not about returns....
5131 2018-03-23 20:33:47 $SGH today reported financial results for the Q4.

#Stocks #Investing #StockAlerts #Bullboard
5132 2018-03-23 20:33:33 If you’d bought on that particular day. And ignored the dividends you’d received.
5133 2018-03-23 20:33:24 Stocks are down!! We the people are losing money...an idiot is in office and you are applauding the rich get rich....you deserve each other.
5134 2018-03-23 20:33:05 西友前で待ち合わせでおなしゃす
5135 2018-03-23 20:32:56 you sell stocks to shareholders to whom you have an obligation to make money for
so those men all made their money from profits
i dont want to be rude but have you ever read a book
5136 2018-03-23 20:32:22 i never won a nickle from stocks i purchased  not once
5137 2018-03-23 20:31:44 If you'd bought in 99 and still held now those values would be completely relevant. The price today is just that. Even peak to trough is interesting over such a long period.
5138 2018-03-23 20:31:27 hey.... dumbass....

look at what Defense Stocks did today when market dropped big-time. 
NOC, RTN, LMT

then go stick you head back in a hole.  

dems/dimms have no idea how they are being played.
5139 2018-03-23 20:30:55 For now this is still bearish and we can't completely discount stocks losing 50%
5140 2018-03-23 20:30:54 Two days in a row my stocks are down due to the idiot on Pennsylvania Ave.
5141 2018-03-23 20:30:49 That's bullsh-t. Stocks are affordable and have been affordable for anyone with an income.

Trump supporter logic is as follows
- When stocks on the rise: "Good job Mr. President".
- When stocks are falling: "Good job Mr. President".

Lol, What?
5142 2018-03-23 20:30:36 You're aware that stocks actually DO something, right?
5143 2018-03-23 20:30:26 i just witnessed a man sit down with a cup of coffee in panera, open his stocks app, see all his stocks down for the day, close the app, then sigh and put his phone down.. poor dude..
5144 2018-03-23 20:29:42 急に埼京線のドアにメガネ折られたの思い出した
5145 2018-03-23 20:29:33 Well, I could quote a very accurate number if I requested data (I don’t have ready access on a Friday evening).
5146 2018-03-23 20:29:09 Thanks Trump! Dow has fallen 1400 points in 2 days, over 5.5%, broader indexes similarly. This has caused loss of $1.65T in US stocks alone. Nikkei fell nearly 5% in a day. That works out to approximately $165M lost per job to “save” 10K steel jobs. @scottlincicome #MoronInChief
5147 2018-03-23 20:28:57 Exactly... Plus gun control idiots wanted to have bump stocks banned but guess what? Bump stocks are original in rifles!
5148 2018-03-23 20:28:37 Nice work Trump. Your incompetent trade posturing is now driving stocks lower. Any jobs in steel will be decimated tenfold by losses in services and higher level manufacturing. And, now that you’ve driven out any talent, your administration will surely make worse blunders.
5149 2018-03-23 20:28:30 Facts about stock ownership:

* Most Americans do NOT own any stock at all
* Stock ownership is strongly concentrated among the rich. The top 10% own about 80% of all the value of stocks
* Black and Hispanic households are about half as likely to own stock as white households
5150 2018-03-23 20:28:08 Nice day for me. 3 out 4 accts. green today and only net short in one. Pot $TWMJF, $GLD +miners, Oil stocks, defense and treasuries did the rest.  

P/L YTD +5.4%  SPY - 3.6%
5151 2018-03-23 20:28:04 it's not that much. it's just heavily weighed in stocks. The bulk of my wealth is in housing.
That can only go up!
5152 2018-03-23 20:27:56 They don’t own any stocks. Virtually irrelevant to 60-70%
5153 2018-03-23 20:27:54 Every one of my stocks tanked today. 
5154 2018-03-23 20:27:17 Those stocks in the left photo are hot
5155 2018-03-23 20:26:50 Who dump Trumped the stocks entered dowjones at 6K exited at dow 24K
5156 2018-03-23 20:26:46 Thank you sir. I have a Roth IRA but I feel I should at minimum become aware of stocks
5157 2018-03-23 20:26:36 @realDonaldTrump stocks are PLUMMETING once again! You are doing such a stellar job for the middle class!
5158 2018-03-23 20:26:33 Massive sell off in the markets Billions wiped off the value of stocks as that fuckn idiot sacks every fucker who disagrees with him!
5159 2018-03-23 20:26:26 That would be valid if it wasn’t only tweeted straight after the market falls and compared to the highest historical daily peak during the dotcom bubble.
5160 2018-03-23 20:26:15 You never know.. what tweet wil lcome and market will shed 100 more points or gains 600 points:)
5161 2018-03-23 20:26:13 So what are bank stocks saying the last few days?
5162 2018-03-23 20:26:03 Need to find all of the defense stocks. This bill funds immediately. No I'm not happy with it. Wish Trump had vetoed but he chose not to fight this one. I'm just going to profit from it, and will continue to support Trump. You & I know you can still win the race with a bad tack.
5163 2018-03-23 20:25:39 So it appears that banning Bump stocks is not an issue
5164 2018-03-23 20:25:18 Stocks are up 5000 points from Jan 2016, your headline is misleading
5165 2018-03-23 20:25:04 March for our lives! Bump stocks put on's a legal oxymoron - March for Our lives! #MarchForOurLives
5166 2018-03-23 20:24:36 Ouais ça m'étonne pas. De toute manière il faut que je me planifie un voyage histoire d'aller faire des stocks !
5167 2018-03-23 20:23:50 WORST WEEK FOR STOCKS SINCE THE LAST TIME THIS HAPPENED LIKE A MONTH AGO
5168 2018-03-23 20:23:40 Defense stocks closes in the green upper arrow after Trump signs $1.3T omnibus spending bill.

5170 2018-03-23 20:23:29 Stocks sank again, giving Wall Street its worst week in two years, as fear gripped investors that China and the U.S. were headed for a trade war. The Dow plunged more than 400 points, bringing its weekly decline to 1,400. @wpdeabc15
5171 2018-03-23 20:23:18 Mark Zuckerberg sold his FB stocks and released a statement.
He always wins
5172 2018-03-23 20:23:18 The Tape Agrees with @CGasparino - Stocks are likely Tariff Tantrum spins out of control. Even if the Prez has some fair points..
5173 2018-03-23 20:23:14 Oh, he was a friendly guy. It was at a charity event that used to be held around Christmas at the race shops in Mooresville, NC called Stocks for Tots. Just tables set up in different buildings with groups of drivers signing autographs.
5174 2018-03-23 20:22:51 Our president @realDonaldTrump is fixing things so folks on a fixed income can by stocks
5175 2018-03-23 20:22:48 #Stocks end the week lower, #Dow closes at 2018 low -425 to 23,533, down 5.7% for the week, #NASDAQ -174, #SP500 -55 @KNX1070 @MottekOnMoney #trade #tariffs #tech #Facebook $FB -$5.50 to $159.39
5176 2018-03-23 20:22:24 we are protesting and creating conversation around gun reform. in an ideal world assault rifles would be banned as well as bum stocks.
5177 2018-03-23 20:22:19 Stocks drop another 300 points today. That’s a loss of over 1,000 points in two days. 
Smooth move by raising tariffs Donald.
5178 2018-03-23 20:21:46 last I saw the stocks are dropping like a rock
5179 2018-03-23 20:21:28 What I mean is Stocks and HY have come down which makes charts and spreads look different. But does that make today a better day to sell than two months ago?
5180 2018-03-23 20:21:18 Absolutely. That new axis of evil (plus Bolton fears) Wiping out Tax cut benefits to the corporations and stocks and will leave the country holding the tax and deficit bill.  Stagflation may finally become a reality.
5181 2018-03-23 20:21:13 Oh I got a whole list of cheap stocks I’m interested in now. Just waiting for the right time.
5182 2018-03-23 20:21:08 Gold/Silver stocks KILLED today!

5194 2018-03-23 20:18:36 Zenyatta sometimes accept htis huggies stocks .
5195 2018-03-23 20:18:32 Plenty of countries have restored their fish stocks by restraining overfishing for as long as it takes, @vincecable. The Canadians, for example. No-one need to be in the EU to make sensible decisions to ensure abundant fish. You're just a daft EU poodle. #Brexit #fisheries #bbcaq
5196 2018-03-23 20:18:21 Yep, its the tit for tat trade war that will end in war if they can bring that about. Just too many folks have to make money from war! Defense stocks should do well.
5197 2018-03-23 20:17:48 Wise words.
Did someone realize they were simply re-creating what we already had, onto #blockchain tech? That's great for the securities world, to tokenize stocks and other investments, but we need more. Otherwise, we indeed will stifle this innovation.
This is #Crowdfunding 2.0+

5208 2018-03-23 20:16:07 To be fair to @paullewismoney he wasn't talking about returns but value. The fact that companies haven't grown in value is still interesting. Can either view it as over valued companies in 99 or lack of growth over period. Be interesting to look at earnings growth in same period.
5209 2018-03-23 20:15:43 now, post what stocks tanked and their relation to china investment or big tech....smh little light to be throwing our skirts up just yet

5212 2018-03-23 20:15:18 I am going to be doing some Cycle work before championship games this weekend. I sense that Stocks are coming into some Lows

5215 2018-03-23 20:14:47 How about Kimbilly Clarke who made over 3billion last yr took their tax cuts to buy back stocks and fire 600 employees.

Plus before he’s done with this country you will only be able to wish you could turn back to any time when he wasn’t your prez. Btw stocks suck under this guy.
5226 2018-03-23 20:13:09 Mexico is paying for the wall,  and deficits are almost 0 , GDP is 6% , stocks market all time I'm high
5227 2018-03-23 20:13:00 Prediction: Senate and House go Democrat. Stocks surge. Trump makes a surprising amount of "deals" with Dems, leading his base to feel betrayed leading to Biden winning 2020.
5228 2018-03-23 20:12:22 Sir, pls veto this is not MAGA. its killing stocks and u have done miraculous things with market and economy.  Pls contunue to support our needs.
5229 2018-03-23 20:12:07 GOOD job president Trump!! Now stocks aren’t just for the liberal elites who can afford top dollar.
5230 2018-03-23 20:12:07 @realDonaldTrump.       Hows YOUR stock market doing???  You know that one thats so STRONG because of you?  Your really helping the working mans pensions you MORON!!  Going to threaten any other countries to drive stocks lower loud mouth???

5233 2018-03-23 20:11:45 Stocks drop 400 points thanks Trump
5234 2018-03-23 20:11:09 As a businessman one would think that @realDonaldTrump would look at the stock markets respond to his new tax policy - and do his best to remedy the effects #stocks #MAGA #FailedPolicy
5235 2018-03-23 20:11:03 #stocks sink. Trump’s inane impetus decision by imposing tariffs on China has threatened US economy .No need for all this showmanship. Thus is the real world not celebrity game.
5236 2018-03-23 20:10:47 #stocks CNBC did say volume is light. Just no buyers now.
5237 2018-03-23 20:10:02 I don't know why anyone is surprised, manipulated market for the last 8 years, stocks bought with someone else's money, now reality sinking in, every rally will be used to sell into, i'm hoping for a 10% rally for the greatest short ever. But short is good...

5239 2018-03-23 20:09:06 Like most of the replies - I use the term loosely - this is a guess. My tweet used actual numbers. And it wasn’t about investing!
5240 2018-03-23 20:09:02 You too have a great weekend. I added small EOG Jul C. Lets see if oil stocks get a lift soon. Unfortunately I sold half my SPY puts too early. Anyway made money this week by trading less and focusing on only a few selected stocks. I keep watching SPY QQQ FSLR WDC MU EOG TWTR
5241 2018-03-23 20:08:36 Why are my stocks going down in value? What happened?
5242 2018-03-23 20:08:31 Today is a great day to top up blue chip dividend stocks! $HOT.UN offers I sustainable distribution which has an annual -year-olds based on current trading of around 11%. Can’t go wrong!
5243 2018-03-23 20:08:10 Glad I don't own stocks
5244 2018-03-23 20:08:07 @realDonaldTrump 3,000 point drop in those stocks. Explain to me again how you’re winning & this isn’t wiping out all that #TaxScam you passed. Please keep up the great work you’re making it really easy for the #BlueWave coming up your ass Very SOON. If you’re not impeached 1st
5245 2018-03-23 20:07:59 Real estate slowed/ fell and people said great, govt is doing this to make housing affordable for everyone, kudos. Modi and team got very excited and did the same in stock markets; making stocks affordable.
5246 2018-03-23 20:07:55 US stocks closed sharply lower again today: $DJIA --425, $SPX -55
5247 2018-03-23 20:07:55 Wow.  Stocks are diving. These trump policies are going to kill America.  Hope we can survive this ass clown.
5248 2018-03-23 20:07:51 Real estate slowed/ fell and people said great, govt is doing this to make housing affordable for everyone, kudos. Modi and team got very excited and did the same in stock markets; making stocks affordable.

5251 2018-03-23 20:06:57 The sudden dramatic decoupling of what had been close to a mirroring of the oil and stocks markets is one of the more bizarre short term shifts I can recall
5252 2018-03-23 20:06:57 how about the flip side???? 
stocks slide over huge continuing trade imbalance w China!  Think about it fox business, your headlines at minimum are misleading.
5253 2018-03-23 20:06:54 Not true. You’d be dead.
5254 2018-03-23 20:06:15 That’s cute. Then why have my stocks dropped nearly $100 in the past two weeks . And slowly but surely dropping over the past three months 
5255 2018-03-23 20:06:12 #ibb #xbi #stocks. Let me describe the past couple of days in two words. “It sucked”
5256 2018-03-23 20:05:45 Weekendstress....no stocks, no worries
5257 2018-03-23 20:05:39 Stocks market benefits the top 1% when it’s high and hurt the rest of us when it’s down. #StockMarket
5258 2018-03-23 20:05:27 #Stocks tumble in biggest weekly decline since 2016, sending the S&P 500 Index to its biggest weekly loss in more than 2 years, on concerns that a trade war and higher borrowing rates could throttle global growth!! Oil surged on a speculation sanctions on Iran will be re-imposed!
5259 2018-03-23 20:05:19 Market Wrap-up: stocks continue decline on trade concerns as the DOW declines over 400pts. Good news is the S&P closed at the 200ema which has provided strong support. WELL and HUM both declining needing to co firm support.
5260 2018-03-23 20:04:54 I'm super happy at the fills. I have a carefully curated portfolio and these GTCs were in accounts that are aging beautifully. The price action is nuts but many good stocks are now at great prices.

5264 2018-03-23 20:03:52 my grade 9 bully stocks the shelves at the Shopper’s near my parent’s house, so when I go home for a visit I always mess up the shelves a bit.
5265 2018-03-23 20:03:40 Adjusting your stocks/bonds ratio? Maybe wait a month...
5266 2018-03-23 20:03:37 @GOP and @realDonaldTrump  Thanks folks...your Liberal Spending Bill cost us 1200 points off our savings stocks in two days. You will be hard pressed to get me back on board after this Bill you all conspired on. F/U!
5267 2018-03-23 20:03:31 Another nasty day for the market. I could see choppyness in the market for the next few weeks. Keeping a watchlist of stocks holding up well $rtn $nem $nflx $mtch $pags $fslr
5268 2018-03-23 20:03:26 Important thought. How would you feel if you had not sold ANY shares of your stocks on the way up? This tactic guarantees profit, minimizes risk, minimizes stress, which helps us thing clearer. And make $$$. #stocks

5279 2018-03-23 20:01:52 Folks Holy Cow this was quite a game. Played brilliantly by the anti trump forces. They let the Mnuchin proxies gorge on stocks early in the first three quarters. Then in the last hour the anti trump forces ate their lunch and wasted BILLIONS OF YOUR money. Looks like 426 neg
5280 2018-03-23 20:01:39 If they commit to sell off treasuries--a yield spike over 3% and stocks would be obliterated.
5281 2018-03-23 20:01:13 After a see-saw day in the market, US stocks closed lower. DJIA down 1415 points (5.6%) for the week.
5282 2018-03-23 20:00:57 Good time to buy stocks at a bargain........ this is a marathon not a sprint !!!!!
5283 2018-03-23 20:00:28 Rule of thumb for investing in stocks: in order to help make the right decision, make sure you can explain to someone else WHY you are buying a stock. This requires research and critical thinking, which makes you a more responsible and smart investor. #dontdostocksalone

5291 2018-03-23 19:57:22 I used to pull pints in 'The Stocks'! 
I don't think this is that far from the truth in that pub. 
5292 2018-03-23 19:57:00 Trump @realDonaldTrump, Ryan & McConnell @SenateMajLdr helped reduce my taxes for 2018. Asinine talk of tariffs & trade wars coupled with a fiscally irresponsible $1.3T spending bill has sent my stocks into a tailspin spin. Hillary, Pelosi & Schumer would get a second look. Egads

5302 2018-03-23 19:55:17 yeah well @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump you both can take ur bill and u knw what. LOOK at OUR BANKING system and the stocks. this is like 2009. REPEAL DODD FRANK IMMEDIATELY

5307 2018-03-23 19:54:07 Great numbers on Stocks and the family!
5308 2018-03-23 19:53:12 The Dow has moved in a greater than 1,400 point range this week.  Fairly large orders to sell stocks at the close.  These are mostly mutual funds getting orders to sell throughout the day from retail investors.  $DIA $SPY

5313 2018-03-23 19:52:19 It is a great thing. Arming teachers is not. That is what mr. Trump wants to do. The way to stop mass shootings is to ban all AR rifles and bump stocks. It’s not anything else. That is how you stop kids from dying while in school LEARNING. And I’m an independent  #DouglasStrong
5314 2018-03-23 19:52:09 I noticed that while the Dow collapsed another 300 points today and the Nasdaq cratered another 2% , defense stocks were up. I call it the Bolton effect.

5317 2018-03-23 19:50:54 Oh man. Hey @realDonaldTrump do you want to address the fact that American Stocks have lost $2T in value since you started your little $60B tariff war? I won't wait around. I know you're too busy funding planned parenthood, NPR, and #MAGA.

5328 2018-03-23 19:49:33 Because you have excluded dividends and chosen the historic high point. Why that date? Why exclude dividends? There must be a reason you decided to pick those two numbers?
5329 2018-03-23 19:49:24 I can only assume that the Europeans, the financial sector, government establishments in Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Great Britain have all discounted the Trump administration the way Wall Street discounts risky stocks.
5330 2018-03-23 19:49:03 Stocks now in plunge mode, Dow -333 points.

5332 2018-03-23 19:48:48 I was told that @KyleKashuv talking with the GOP had nothing to do with it either, so can’t give Hogg credit when he hasn’t even attempted to meet with them! They haven’t acted in any way except enforce what’s there..& deal with bump stocks that should’ve been dealt with in 2012
5333 2018-03-23 19:48:40 Not since 1999 you can’t. I’ve done this exercise. Today yes. Which is why choosing the lowest cost tracker is the way to hitch your fortunes to the economy. But not in 1999

5340 2018-03-23 19:46:34 Look at that stock market continuing to drop!
Do you know what that means? It means the stock market, or those owning stocks, have no faith in you.

5342 2018-03-23 19:46:03 Short term traders buying into this close ... are doing a mistake ... levels don't matter that much, the market will do whatever it wants. Retail traders have a tendency to trade levels as if levels carried magic properties. #stocks #trading
5343 2018-03-23 19:45:53 Of course u can. As HL did which I reported.
5344 2018-03-23 19:45:37 You can access a tracker for 0.05% and and ISA or pension for 0.25%. So assuming dividend yield of 3.5%, annual return net of charges is 3.2%

5350 2018-03-23 19:45:08 (2/2) ...we've found in our post-mortem work on mistakes that one of the best ways to lose money over time is by owning stocks with changing investment rationales. - Ragen Stienke
5351 2018-03-23 19:45:07 Most don’t realize the correlation this has with stocks
5352 2018-03-23 19:44:23 I’m more than happy for people not to be interested as I am in the value over time of the companies in the FTSE100. But to get all defensive about investment is odd to say the least.
5353 2018-03-23 19:44:14 And yes, I know we've still had a nice run up in stocks and people should not freak out about a correction. But whatever, people had money and now have less and that makes them (me!) mad.

5356 2018-03-23 19:43:20 Still not seeing big rallies there. I can't figure out why on days when stocks are struggling.
5357 2018-03-23 19:43:07 As stocks do it's thing, the dollar and bonds are doing more watching so far.  Its a stock market thing
As the stocks run all over the place, the forex market is not doing a whole lot.
As London was exiting for the day:
The S&P was down -14.8 points. It is down -41 points now
5358 2018-03-23 19:42:25 Which is why I didn’t use that word. HL says it was 4.4% for the all share but that’s before charges. One fund that’s been around that long has returned 5% after charges , though picking that survivor in 1999 out of the ones available would have been impossible.
5359 2018-03-23 19:42:03 Another lackluster week for stocks. Was really hoping to kill it trading here from Mazatlan but it just hasn't been that way. Down a bit on balance. A couple weeks left to right the wrong. Enjoy your weekends.

5392 2018-03-23 19:33:03 Yes, @nick_c_fisch the article references Atlantic salmon. BC's salmon stocks are also in decline and no one knows why. Recent theory, is they are dying out at sea. Possibly, due to warming seas. More studies need to be done to confirm cause.

Stocks down, crude oil up.

Repeat of 2008. Only that in 2008 oil was at $120, not $65.

Then it collapsed to $40. Which mean this time would collapse to....... $5?
5453 2018-03-23 19:16:59 If you are trading, buy a low on Monday, maybe buy puts after the first rally for a week, stocks may still hammer a low from here. But then, make sure to have some longs by the end of March and hold them until May... $SPX
5454 2018-03-23 19:16:55 Not a bad spot to nibble on some stocks.  But Monday I'd leave a lot of room for more potential downside.  Stormy is on 60 minutes Sunday night!

5536 2018-03-23 18:54:02 That’s kind of pointless to ban bump stocks but okay fine. 

Vote no on sections 4020 and 4021. 

Also if you pass background checks for private sales how do you intend to enforce that??
5537 2018-03-23 18:53:55 @KatyTurNBC It will be interesting to see how the market ends today, It was up 73 points at open, investors scooping up stocks that lost value yesterday but now it's -131 and still falling.
5538 2018-03-23 18:53:54 Taking the day to restructure my risk calculator. Lowering risk on stocks by 20% ETFs by 15% and after stops that hit moving to a 25% cash in account 75% working in positions. Let the market find its way. Will scale back in as see fit. Good day for learning!

5540 2018-03-23 18:53:02 Stocks attempted to bounce back after yesterday's brutal sell-off, in what was seen as a delayed reaction to the Trump administration's announcement to impose tariffs on Chinese imports and subsequent tariff retaliation from China.

5548 2018-03-23 18:52:12 First off butt stocks should not be allowed. They turn a semi weapon into an automatic. Automatic is a waste of ammo. So I agree with it. Magazines should be allowed at any capacity. Age does not matter and is not the reason. It’s procedures police need to react to contact.

5640 2018-03-23 18:19:36 If you’re holding long term great, but there’s just NO reason to buy any stocks right now!

5643 2018-03-23 18:17:28 Buy and hold, in an industry or buis U like.  Hold until U see fundamental change. There are stocks that generally go up year after year.  I know, hard to believe. Alot of people have made alot of $$ that way. day tde Id rather play pc chess level 10 hit my head with a hammer

5648 2018-03-23 18:16:20 They said it didn’t come from Porton Down, OK, that just means they have admitted that they have some there. It would have been simple to just state we have no stocks of Novichok so it COULDN’T have come from here.

5654 2018-03-23 18:10:27 Mid-Day: Not much change from this morning.  Stocks are still mixed with S&P 500 going back and forth in positive/negative territory, NASDAQ is still down and DOW is still up.  MBS is still down 6bps with Yields up slightly to 2.84%.

5666 2018-03-23 18:05:50 Brother I never said stocks are over-valued or under-valued. I used the word "discounted valuations" which means the stocks are available at much lower rate than what we saw when #Nifty traded above 10500 levels !

5734 2018-03-23 17:40:34 Even you check it doesn't mean anything, iv'e stocks with the same vol/float/news etc. some run 100-200% without even pulling back some tank right after the halt and some don't. 80% of these stocks will go right back where they came from but 20% is enough to blow up your account
5735 2018-03-23 17:40:33 Not so fast.  So if millions of people in the general public own this company by its stocks how can one persons views trump others point of views or speech

5774 2018-03-23 17:21:54 Good call Mr. President, it’s also time to reverse our stocks position and eat a sweet bear claw for more windfall profits. Living the dream, America is great again!
5775 2018-03-23 17:21:20 You can’t satisfy everyone
5776 2018-03-23 17:20:56 Don’t think I need to tell anyone but you’ve guessed it I’m red today Down 0.92%. with 22 and 9. 
FEVR RFX TUNE and WAND the worst performers.  A couple of  stocks included SPE and OMG. Enjoy your weekend everyone and don’t think about stocks until Monday  cheers
5777 2018-03-23 17:20:23 Nobody is violating anything. Banning semi-automatic weapons and bump stocks does not violate any amendment.
5778 2018-03-23 17:20:10 It has been about other things: soy, steel, pigs and pipes. Nevertheless, Boeing has been among the worst-hit stocks because of the trade tensions. Its shares are down more than 12% from their late February peak.
5779 2018-03-23 17:19:58 Nothing to do with you. You are Dutch, why are you bothered? Hmm maybe u know u will have to stump up more money for the EU coffers or is it the plundering of our fish stocks?
5780 2018-03-23 17:19:36 And you are still stupid because stocks are always up and down and in between. Just like Obamas Presidency
5781 2018-03-23 17:19:28 Bolton is a nut job. Buy defense stocks...
5782 2018-03-23 17:19:00 8 billion from taxes to workers, 176 billion dollars in stock buy backs by Corporations. 4 million workers or 4% of the working population have received higher wages or bonuses. 84% of stocks owned by 10%, 40% owned by 1%. Tax cuts has done very little for the working class.
5783 2018-03-23 17:18:46 Haha have you seen Hillary? Can't even walk down a flight of stairs... But you just keep believing that BS that he's not fit for office. Black unemployment lowest in 17 years. Stocks up, Jobs back. But you believe CNN okay.
5784 2018-03-23 17:18:36 One time I was   behind cocky stocks !

5786 2018-03-23 17:17:13 You know I really like the CNBC traders at noon but you can't be telling viewers stocks go up 80% of the time. It's more 60/40 than 80/20.
5787 2018-03-23 17:17:13 Ya, the Dems/Progressives are proper F***'n Fakebook now. Advitisors bailing. Stocks swirlling. Will find Zuckerberg like they found David Carradine.

5792 2018-03-23 17:15:56 Your rapid declining stocks have been going on since the time of obama! If they go down use your head and buy.
5793 2018-03-23 17:15:53 @gauravparikh Sir, read your article on HOV...have been holding it since 70 levels...any more of such fundamental stocks?
5794 2018-03-23 17:15:45 It doesn't aways happen like this (and we don't claim to have a crystal ball) but it's critical to own other things aside from stocks and bonds. We own more gold $GLD than ever before and it's up +1.15% relative to the stock market being down -4.70% the past month.

5799 2018-03-23 17:13:30 S&P500 with a strong reaction bounce right here. Asking for a second sell-off in a row is probably too much to ask for. Dont chase stocks on the downside!

5801 2018-03-23 17:13:13 Gold Prices rose sharply against all major currencies, recovering even last week's 1.5% drop in Japanese Yen terms while stocks and shares fell worldwide as Beijing hit back at Washington with plans for new import tariff rates on US goods arriving in China
5802 2018-03-23 17:12:56 The fact of the matter is you yourself dont know where the bottom is.. you can only buy stocks based on insider news and relations wt promoters, which small investors so not have access to.. so just stop worrying abt small investors... and focus on your stock picking

5865 2018-03-23 17:08:08 Yes I don't see why anyone should have semi automatic guns, bump stocks, or high capacity magazines, but I do think with lots of compromise there is a logical solution for these types of weapons that don't necessarily involve banning them.

5947 2018-03-23 16:59:47 $MU has been cyclically cooling since March 13th. The cycle should complete sooner than later. Giant support at psy'$50. Soft target for April/May $70/75.... which isn't bold after the recent 63s.
5948 2018-03-23 16:59:45 late confirmation email?
5949 2018-03-23 16:59:44 Money left stocks, looked at crypto briefly... shook its head and then went in gold by the looks of it.
5950 2018-03-23 16:58:55 Nice to hear Republican and Democrat speaking out together against ghost guns and bump stocks
5951 2018-03-23 16:58:53 It means people are starting to now be very scared of the Trump factor as it relates to owning stocks. People are now scared of what this moron is gonna say or do next, & no longer want exposure to stocks worrying what may come next. It’s not “if”, but “when”.
5952 2018-03-23 16:58:37 Nope @ works just fine... Also bump stocks aren't banned just yet... At least not according to what I could find (although in process) 

And what's the purpose of having high capacity clips magazines unless you plan on killing a high amount of people..

5955 2018-03-23 16:57:35 I just realized how much of an adult I’ve become. I’m sitting on my porch with a cup of coffee looking at what stocks I should invest in.
5956 2018-03-23 16:57:23 Small & micro cap stocks still offer great opportunities, especially in Canada where markets are far more regulated against pure stock promotions.

Investors are able to enter at or next to the ground floor. Technology, mining, energy, blockchain and marijuana.

Worth discussing?
5957 2018-03-23 16:57:16 why is $MU down??
5958 2018-03-23 16:56:21 my school deadass blocked yahoo on the computers and the reason was social networking.. i literally just need to research stocks for personal finance
5959 2018-03-23 16:56:12 No Cuomo...most is true...the part at the end about other countries is questionable...rest is 100% accurate..btw..keeping the fed rate at zero or near zero is the ONLY reason the stocks rose during obama..as the fed raises rates look what's happening now
5960 2018-03-23 16:55:25 Nike and energy companies led modest gains in U.S. stocks on Friday, amid lingering fears of a trade war, although a Micron-led slump in semiconductor companies kept gains in check.
5961 2018-03-23 16:55:14 We need a list of who owns Citibank and what companies are controlled by Citibank! What companies do business with Citibank. What stocks does Citibank control. Let's break this bank!
5962 2018-03-23 16:55:08 @sangrigioIf  if it's a public institution, the lines can get blurry.. that was my point. and if you look at the law of comapnys regarding public or private it comes down to how there stocks are traded.
5963 2018-03-23 16:54:49 New or gullible Investors should not blindly trust advice on SM. A better thumb rule is to stay away from stocks which are not being covered by top 3 Indian brokerages (Kotak, MOSL and IIFL)
5964 2018-03-23 16:54:03 Yes, 4 or 5 trusted labs, invarious countries around the world, manufactured tiny amounts of Novichok agents a couple of years ago under OPCW supervision & at their request, following Russia's admission that it had (undeclared) stocks of it & kept them for comparison purposes.

5974 2018-03-23 16:49:46 @jpmorgan Please follow Citigroup's lead in gun control. Mandate that your retail sector clients and partners restrict the sale of firearms for people younger than 21 and not sell bump stocks and pass background checks. Act in solidarity with our nation's young people.
5975 2018-03-23 16:49:03 Here in India gold stocks are still falling along with the rest of market. Fingers crossed for the big move on the up side next week!

5977 2018-03-23 16:48:50 $EDIT $CRSP $BLUE Can these stocks survive in the upside through this summer selloff and market melt down????  Better get out early to avoid massive loss.
5978 2018-03-23 16:48:40 Rep. Patrick Brennan (R-Colchester) is taking issue with the fact that the bump stock ban would not "grandfather" any bump stocks - the devices would become illegal to possess if the proposal passes. #VTpoli
5979 2018-03-23 16:48:32 @CapitalOne Please follow Citigroup's lead in gun control. Mandate that your retail sector clients and partners restrict the sale of firearms for people younger than 21 and not sell bump stocks and pass background checks. Act in solidarity with our nation's young people.
5980 2018-03-23 16:48:26 All Americans want common sense gun laws.  I believe the POTUS said he was going to ban bump stocks which need to be regulated obviously. Thanks for the kind reply.  Best of luck to you.

5984 2018-03-23 16:47:39 No argument there, Just pointing out the inconsistency with the USDA's ending stocks estimate.
5985 2018-03-23 16:47:35 Don't make too much noise or Cuomo will call you out as a fake hockey player. The day Chris "Wooden Head" Cuomo understands context, satire, truth, honesty, or responsibility not only within his profession, but just in general ... sell your stocks as the rapture is approaching.
5986 2018-03-23 16:47:17 I should start investing in stocks rather than property I guess

5988 2018-03-23 16:47:03 Another frustration w/#neleg tax credit scholarship debate: opponents forget tax code already lets the wealthy give gains from stocks tax-free to nonprofits & claim a fed deduction. We stood up against LB1130 for nonprofits that are funded exactly like that & use $ to oppose 295.
5989 2018-03-23 16:45:52 Still waiting for an answer on 30 round clips/magazines , bump stocks, assault rifles,  stricter back ground checks and mental health issues.... ohh yeah... 

You don't have one
5990 2018-03-23 16:45:23 If we own stocks in the Trump blast zone it’s time to start selling them.
5991 2018-03-23 16:45:17 The world banking financial systems and countries geared towards debt re mortgages and stocks / commodities/bonds etc. IF Obama had done what the rock star economy’s did.USA would have recovered within 2 years and not lost half the jobs they did.
5992 2018-03-23 16:44:46 Big deal! As if bump stocks are the problem!!! Get rid of the weapons that kill military style - it's an insult to Americans to tout accomplishments with a ban placed on some accessory no one really knows / cares about. Most assailants killed without it.

6079 2018-03-23 16:32:56 well… that’s not really how stocks work, but it’s only at the price it was in October. Big drop for sure, but keep things in perspective.
6080 2018-03-23 16:32:15 @AliVelshi Since shorted stocks are held in the name of the broker, is it possible to track who is benefiting? Say, for example, a President that doesn’t disclose finances and can cause stocks to drop precipitously.
6081 2018-03-23 16:31:55 @SenFeinstein You said: We can improve background checks, limit magazine size, ban bump stocks, raise the age for buying a semi-automatic rifle, and provide a legal process for securing a restraining order when someone has a mental illness. Note: AR-15 is not an assault weapon.
6082 2018-03-23 16:30:46 Great bit on the tariffs!  Finally a voice on the epic decline in steel and aluminum producers stocks, almost a free fall since tariffs were even brought into the equation.  Is this suspicious at all?  Who are the sellers, shorters?

6089 2018-03-23 16:28:40 Always interesting to me that people don't stop and do simple math. $TRP.CA is down 20% from its high, boosting dividend yield by 25% to almost 5%. Meanwhile, 5 yr CDAs up to a huge 2.06% fully taxable. My view: Bank of CDA rate hikes already fully discounted in yield stocks.

Congress is on a 2 week recess. If Trump vetoes, all of congress will need to fly back to DC, rewrite a bill, debate it & vote. Meanwhile, stocks have plummeted from his tariff scheme.

6096 2018-03-23 16:25:49 I try to invest outside the “five eyes” nations when I invest in stocks. Especially emerging market funds. One need not stay out of the long term best performing asset class to avoid the Goldman/CIA/NSA - pumped stocks.

6100 2018-03-23 16:24:34 Here is how the tax cuts have worked so far. Corp. have spent 8 billion dollars on bonuses & increased wages. Corporations have spent 176 billion dollars in stock buy backs. 84% of all stocks are owned by by 10%. 40% by 1%. These taxes cuts have done little for the working class.
6101 2018-03-23 16:23:19 I read that logic somewhere on Twitter. Corporate tax + STT + LTCG... But do you think fairly long term investor making nX from stocks really care about 10%LTCG. The gap between returns from equity and other asset class is huge. 10% doesn't make equity unattractive.

6105 2018-03-23 16:21:58 Bonjour et pardonnez ma réponse tardive. Théoriquement ce sont les stocks de brut qui ont le plus d'impact sur le cours. Si déstockage + important que consensus = baisse offre = hausse du prix (et vice-versa avec un restockage). Bien à vous

6113 2018-03-23 16:19:23 I wonder how many of Trump's friends hit it big shorting stocks just prior to tariff announcement?  You know, the people he calls for "advice" at night. Anyone got a clue?
6114 2018-03-23 16:19:19 Context: Percentage of Stocks Trading above 40 day moving average = 32%. Recent Feb. lows were 8%. So we aren't quite at 25%, were buyers usually step in, but we are close.

6131 2018-03-24 23:56:26 Dumb fucking GOP nobody is talking about banning all guns.  We want AR 14 and 15 semi automatics, bump stocks, banned from civilian hands! These stupid groups that call themselves militia isn’t the law enforcement or the military! Gawd! Get rid of these freedom caucus/tea party!

6136 2018-03-24 23:54:07 This is a lie. 

The Obama administration didn't legalize bump stocks. 

Obama issued EOs creating stricter controls (all of which Trump has rolled back), but could not legally restrict (non mechanical) bump stocks without new laws. Congress refused.
6137 2018-03-24 23:54:06 1) Obama administration approved the sale of bumps stocks Not because they liked it, but because the law did not permit them to prohibit it. 2) the DOJ can issue a rule all day however, Making it stick is another question because the rule will be immediately go to court
6138 2018-03-24 23:53:00 Automatic weapons need to go away too. 
A person friend died in Las Vegas doesn’t care if an NRA lackey is whining over bump stocks.
The kids in today’s #MarchForOurLives have family members who vote. These kids are future voters.
6139 2018-03-24 23:52:52 See that's where they are blowing smoke about this.  No one is trying to take away our second amendment rights.  All we want is a more thourough background check, ban on bump stocks, limits on the amount of assault rifles one can own or a complete ban on assault rifles limits on
6140 2018-03-24 23:52:42 Trump trying to take credit for bump stocks, your reporting is so weak.
Bump stock ban isn’t really addressing the issue, time for you to step aside and let real people address these issues.
6141 2018-03-24 23:52:39 At this point I think most people who voted for you are still reeling from your latest gaff, being too cowardly to shut down the govt and force a sensible budget. You broke yourself with that one. No one cares about bump stocks. Get your act together.

6143 2018-03-24 23:52:23 Video of the belt loop “option” is a ridiculous justification of not banning bump stocks. Ease of acquisition and ease of use has to make a huge difference.
6144 2018-03-24 23:52:10 uhh.. he did scrap bump stocks.. so at least correct your one sentence

6165 2018-03-24 23:51:43 Let me help you Kevin. it is a Turkish company and they do not have any sanctions to do business with Iran like the U.S. the fact that $FRFS #GIFA merger will take place holds no merit on the U.S. sanctions on Iran. example Russian stocks are traded here as well.
6166 2018-03-24 23:51:32 Do you pretend to believe in God just so you can drop that trite line? I’m a gun owner, but I’m very sure Jesus didnt care about your access to bump stocks. Have some common sense - the @NRA is a trade organization, not a defender of the 2nd amendment...they’re a threat to it.
6167 2018-03-24 23:51:06 You're wrong. That's a ruling not a law. It didn't legalize or criminalize bump stocks. The legislative branch makes laws not the executive
6168 2018-03-24 23:50:39 Also, Obama didn’t “legalize” it.

The ATF ruled bump stocks are a component. They were already legal.
6169 2018-03-24 23:50:28 Owning assault weapons, bump stocks are not in the bible either.
6170 2018-03-24 23:50:21 The bump stock allows bump firing to be easier. It can shoot faster, but it isn't fully automatic. Read my other reply. I don't think bump stocks should be easy to get, if not banned.

Also, a good trigger finger can pretty much do a similar thing.
6171 2018-03-24 23:50:11 Bump stocks don’t make it automatic. They just allow you use the guns recoil better by allow more kick to push the trigger to where your trigger finger is, to simulate automatic fire, but by doing that, you have horrible accuracy
6172 2018-03-24 23:49:44 Wow okay great, let’s ban bump stocks then. All problems will finally go away.
6173 2018-03-24 23:49:41 Yes bump stocks are a novelty that have no practical application except if you want to rapidly dump hundreds of rounds from a high firing position into an enclosed area filled with a lot of people. They should be banned.
6174 2018-03-24 23:49:30 There is no conversation with the left.  A lot of people think bump stocks are not good.  But that right there is why nobody will give an inch.
6175 2018-03-24 23:49:15 Maybe we should allow the bump stocks...?
6176 2018-03-24 23:49:03 Wait. So are you calling bump stocks your RIGHT?!

A bump stock is not an “arm” in any sense, and especially not in a constitutional one.
6177 2018-03-24 23:48:51 Okay homeboy. Go back to taking your bribes from the NRA NO one is banning guns. They are getting rid of assault weapons, bump stocks and getting rid of background check loopholes. Facts are hard! #MarchForOurLives
6178 2018-03-24 23:48:49 Gambling with cards or dice or stocks is all one thing. It's getting money without giving an equivalent for it. - Henry Ward Beecher
6179 2018-03-24 23:48:45 LIE! The previous administration did not legalize bump stocks. Republican congress refused to ban them because they were considered an accessory so they did not fall under ATF jurisdiction. Big difference. BIGLY, so stop lying for once.
6180 2018-03-24 23:48:36 CSGOD sometimes arguing during discord stocks .   
6181 2018-03-24 23:48:28 GOOD ONE! NOW, ONLY THE TERRORISTS ON AMERICAN SOIL WILL HAVE BUMP STOCKS. AMAZING HOW SMART THE ENEMY IS AND HOW DUMB AMERICANS ARE.
6182 2018-03-24 23:48:25 Obama didn’t “approve” bump stocks. There just wasn’t a law that said they were illegal. Don’t twist the truth.
6183 2018-03-24 23:48:03 Moral of the story DID OBAMA BAN BUMP STOCKS? you wont answer the question... did he pass anything to do ANYTHING about these issues. I’ll wait!
6184 2018-03-24 23:47:50 Agreed.  I am a Lifetime NRA member, and could give a rat's a^^ about bump stocks.  Nor does anyone I shoot with here in N. Texas.  

But I bet a bunch of suburban housewives are glad to outlaw more efficient human-killing adaptations, in exchange  for ARMED TEACHERS.
6185 2018-03-24 23:47:33 Not all bump stocks are legal, by the way. If you are untrained with them they don't work as intended. I don't support bump stocks anyways.
6186 2018-03-24 23:47:30 I have no problems with semi-auto AR-15s. I'd say maybe limits on large capacity mags and bump stocks. Since auto weapons are banned already
6187 2018-03-24 23:47:23 The worst thing to do is buy into a stock as volatile as something in the game industry. You're much better off investing in stable stocks that are a worthwhile investment.
6188 2018-03-24 23:47:17 That doesn't stop chairpersons and higher ups from profiting from stocks and shares in ammunitions and gun profits. That shouldn't be much of a surprise, why would you not have stock in something you back?
6189 2018-03-24 23:46:42 Minsan kapag nakikita ko si @AprilLeeTan na nagjojog gusto ko tanungin mga FA ng stocks ko hahahaha
6190 2018-03-24 23:46:35 Don't forget that @cathymcmorris has defended bump stocks, legislation to expand the availability of gun silencers. She has an A rating from the #NRA.  #marchforourlives #BlueWaveIsComing
6191 2018-03-24 23:45:14 No one is trying to ban guns, except bump stocks. I believe more money to the schools for mental health with several additional counselors and school psychologists will help. Domestic abusers should not be allowed weapons.
6192 2018-03-24 23:44:54 If you want to invest for your future learn and trade stocks with the best
6193 2018-03-24 23:44:02 Somehow I don’t think our nation’s founders meant for the general public to have guns - automatic semi-automatic guns, mass ammo cartridges or bump stocks. I doubt they envisioned mass murder or children murdering other children when they wrote the second amendment
6194 2018-03-24 23:43:09 Ban Assault Rifles and bump stocks. Weapons of War shouldn't be on the streets or chillen in a House somewhere. The conversation should turn into "how did he buy that weapon because it's existence in Civilian Possession is not allowed?"
6195 2018-03-24 23:43:04 What!!!Really? There’s not going to be a line up of ‘bad guys’ handing in their bump stocks?
6196 2018-03-24 23:42:30 I really hope in Smash 5 they do a KoF thing and make separate stocks depending on the team you select. For instance: 

You select Mario, Luigi, and Peach. If you loose your Mario stock, you will then have a Luigi come out instead. It'd make competitive Smash interesting.
6197 2018-03-24 23:41:59 I am okay with potus giving a little on this.   But sadly wont stop all bad guys from getting machine guns or bump stocks...where there is a will there is a way...
6198 2018-03-24 23:41:58 @madisongesiotto @AlessandraLynnG just read an excellent book by Ben Stein, the Capitalist Code. I recommend the family read the book. It is very good.

Brief: Buy index fund, all 500 stocks in Standard & Poor's 500 industrial stock index and hold on to it for a very long time.
6199 2018-03-24 23:41:50 Here are some:
1. More restrictive/tighter background checks
2. Mandatory waiting periods
3. Banning high capacity magazines
4. Banning bump stocks.
5. Banning assault rifles

And we keep working on other solutions instead of simply saying the system failed. We actually try.
6200 2018-03-24 23:41:23 President trump you signed this this bullshit bill that you promised us you would not fund sanctuary or planned parenthood and we are still supporting you now you start going after the NRA and banning bump stocks you and the rep are going to lose our support
6201 2018-03-24 23:40:45 I'm for that too, and mental health examinations, banning assault weapons and weapons designed to perform like them. But I do support being able to own/buy a standard gun. And also ban bump stocks.

I feel that if people want assault weapons, they can join the military.
6202 2018-03-24 23:40:40 Banning bump stocks is a great idea! Luckily, the current administration is taking the steps to do that! And thank you Fromm, that compliment means a lot!
6203 2018-03-24 23:40:34 There are literally more people struck by lightning in the U.S. every year than killed with rifles of any kind. This was never about AR-15s or bump stocks, it's because of the type of people who own guns - White people.
6204 2018-03-24 23:40:22 I would like to hear one, SPECIFIC demand. More gun control isn't a request... already banned bump stocks.. so what are they specifically fighting for?
6205 2018-03-24 23:40:14 Lmao good riddance bump stocks
6206 2018-03-24 23:38:29 Stop the inane arguments. Restrictions on semiautomatics, bump stocks, and magazines do not equal ban on guns any more than me being banned from standing up in a movie theater yelling fire means I have lost my right to free speech.
6207 2018-03-24 23:38:22 To regulate or edit doesn’t mean to take away trump just took away bump stocks he’s the one taking ur guns

6213 2018-03-24 23:37:31 Andy .. I was there in the 60s .. not much changed.. 21 to buy a rifle outlaw bump stocks.. smaller magazines too bad crazies won’t care .. crazies are the problem but people are afraid to legally call someone crazy because of lawsuits and scummie ass lawyers
6214 2018-03-24 23:36:37 And there it is. The generalization of an item. It’s not bump stocks that are illegal. It is “devices.” ATF will start confiscations as they make their own definition of “device.”
6215 2018-03-24 23:36:17 I'm from a rural area and go to school in Lubbock. I don't support bump stocks but the AR-15s aren't military grade.

6217 2018-03-24 23:35:57 concern all of a sudden, where were these fake liberals when Obama was in office legalized bump stocks, so full of BS
6218 2018-03-24 23:35:23 I’m okay with no bump stocks, but it has to stop there. You do anything else and I see it as a threat to my constitutional rights
6219 2018-03-24 23:35:15 Reminder to #MarchForOurLives protestors, Democrats could’ve passed massive gun control in 2009-10, but didn’t.

Obama approved bump stocks.

Democrat politicians get huge donations w/ these rallies. They don’t really want to solve the issues, because donations will dry up.
6220 2018-03-24 23:35:07 Put him in the stocks 
6221 2018-03-24 23:34:56 ... or you could do both? Heighten checks and ban AR? Banning assault rifles and bump stocks will do plenty. It will stop shooters firing continuously. We can do both, heighten background checks, give mentally ill people the help they need AND ban AR and bump stocks.
6222 2018-03-24 23:34:55 Trump already spoke out in favor of these kids exercising their first amendment rights as did the White House this morning. Trump is the only president to actually have banned bump stocks.  Why didn’t Obozo do that when he had a chance? Actions speak louder than words 
6223 2018-03-24 23:34:43 So, basically changing nothing considering there is no legal definition of "high capacity", bump stocks are being stolen from owners by the govt, and FFLs that sell after a deny are royally screwed anyways.
6224 2018-03-24 23:34:37 If you train and arm the teachers that love the kids, I will applaud your 
banning bump stocks.  Teachers are the most cost effective people to 
protect our children.  Provide them their second amendment rights and
it will help.  That would be the most cost effective approach.
6225 2018-03-24 23:33:56 @sssvenky ....is there one of the Defense sector stocks $BA $LMT $NOC $RTN or other chart you like best.... I’ve a feeling with Bolton taking over this group will advance.. thx
6226 2018-03-24 23:33:48 Won’t change anything, bump stocks were raved about due to Vegas. The reality is if he didn’t use a bump stock he would have killed more people. Although increasing rate of fire, it significantly decreases accuracy. He was 32 stories up, Imagine if he was more accurate.
6227 2018-03-24 23:33:43 Bump stocks were only recently made illegal in some areas in response to the LV massacre.
6228 2018-03-24 23:33:34 ATF did review it (in 2010) and determined that bump stocks did not violate any existing law..changing that ruling would invite litigation..any action on bump stocks needs to come from congress.
6229 2018-03-24 23:33:32 Specifically the AR-15 to start, which historically used as the weapon of choice in mass shootings, bump stocks, which were supposed to be out lawed after Vegas.
6230 2018-03-24 23:33:26 Hey there, they are still indeed in our range, fresh stocks delivered each morning 
6231 2018-03-24 23:32:19 YOU are the beholden, taking all that money from the @NRA! @GOP are the reason these kids are being gunned down in their schools. HUSH, until you stand up to @NRA & BAN LONG guns (not shotguns) bump stocks, high capacity and FIX THIS MASSACRE of our BABIES!
6232 2018-03-24 23:31:56 Then why didn't you ban bump stocks during your presidency?
6233 2018-03-24 23:31:56 #NaturalGas  is expected to drop over 180 pips. Keep holding it till otherwise #forexsignals #forextrading #forex #stocks #gold #futures #RT
6234 2018-03-24 23:31:47 Sure, I don’t disagree, but military-style weapons, bump stocks  and stuff like that are not needed in civilians hands.  I served in the military 5 years, so I am not naive about weapons
6235 2018-03-24 23:31:18 Saw what? Stocks don’t go below zero. How can a business be worth less than zero to common equity holders
6236 2018-03-24 23:30:57 Bump stocks were approved during the Obama administration, he signed off on it! So is he to be held accountable for all the deaths in Las Vegas Nevda on October 1st? Of course Not!..
6237 2018-03-24 23:30:45 It does not matter which asset class, neither the direction. You don't want to make predictions, you want to follow the money. #tradebehaviour #quant #algo #stocks #indices $ES_F $SPY #BTC $DAX_F $XAU #trading $YM #bitcoin #dollar
6238 2018-03-24 23:30:31 I wonder if the @NRA is shaking in their boots yet. They better sell their stocks quick while it is still worth anything at all...
6239 2018-03-24 23:29:57 Between stocks, autofire, triggers, barrel length, etc & now that Trump has banned bump stocks. There ARE restrictions.....
6240 2018-03-24 23:29:48 I’m all for banning bump stocks and stronger background checks. But raising the age of buying guns or banning certain guns won’t solve the problem
6241 2018-03-24 23:28:28 It's era of artificial intelligence to trade stocks.
The person will continue to increase the money without having to work even one second.
6242 2018-03-24 23:28:12 We worry about Bump Stocks for guns. Yet we let people threaten our President and do nothing to them we need to worry about bump mouths. We need to band them. GGa
6243 2018-03-24 23:28:04 @nitinbhatia121 Hi Nitinji.. I just would like to have you advice on my strategy. I have identified 3 stocks and planning to accumulate on every dip every month. Your suggestion on this pl.
6244 2018-03-24 23:27:52 So where were you WJC on this topic as POTUS?  At least President Trump banned the bump stocks, something that should have been done long ago, like maybe when you or Obozo were pres!?
6245 2018-03-24 23:27:30 Many gun owners who NEED 2 have the fastest firing weapons they can get r paranoid that #GunControlNow means guns will b taken away. #NRA & gun mfrs perpetuate paranoia. Can have reasonable gun laws w/o banning guns. Don’t need bump stocks, etc. but some MUST have them? 4 fun?
6246 2018-03-24 23:26:45 People aren’t mearching to ban guns. Eliminate background check loopholes, have an ownership registry, hold parents accountable if their kids use their weapons, ban bump stocks, limit clip size, ban assault rifles. All legal to do. Doesn’t infringe on #2A. Stop lying
6247 2018-03-24 23:26:43 This project is an opportunity of investors to benefit from two of the largest commodities in the stocks market. @Goldiam_ico uses the blockchain technology to make this possible.
6248 2018-03-24 23:26:21 As if banning bump stocks or universal background checks are tyranny. 
6249 2018-03-24 23:26:16 If you agree with the @NRA and you are for bump stocks, unlimited clip size, military grade weapons, and against comprehensive background checks, you are NOT on the right side. #MarchForOurLives #GunSense
6250 2018-03-24 23:25:53 How about banning Hump Stocks?
6251 2018-03-24 23:25:45 Trump decided to introduce a ban on bump stocks after that listening session.
6252 2018-03-24 23:25:32 Think he is trying to pander without really changing much. I personally think bump stocks are stupid as shit, but we know how this slope goes...
6253 2018-03-24 23:24:35 Marching for : 3 day waiting period, all gun owners must take a test, get a license, have insurance..just like if you want to drive a car, register all guns in a national registry, no assault weapons, no bump stocks, no 30 round magazines
 Okay? ??
6254 2018-03-24 23:24:31 While I agree that Guns are not the underlying issue here, they have however become a symptomatic issue.   Civilians do not need access to purchase military style weapons or bump stocks, as they only serve 1 purpose, to kill. I am a supporter of 2A, just not those items.
6255 2018-03-24 23:24:16 Its never going to stop with just a ban on “bump stocks” or “assault rifles”
6256 2018-03-24 23:24:15 Banning bump stocks (the day before the March!) Is a very small step in the need to restrict and tighten the gun laws!
6257 2018-03-24 23:24:10 So do we call you king or dictator. You and you alone decide what money is spent where? You are the greastest insider trader of all time. You can mutilate the stock markets. Did you and your rich friends sell their stocks before you started a trade war? You even know what to buy!
6258 2018-03-24 23:24:04 J’ai réussi chez Micromania, plutôt facilement grâce à @nintendalerts et franchement vu les stocks annoncés j’y croyais pas
6259 2018-03-24 23:23:43 Yeah, a ban on bump stocks.  I know I voted to be made a felon overnight, how about you?
6260 2018-03-24 23:23:20 Relax Peter, dont forget Buffet, Munger and Lynch all Permabulls of stocks market are more successfull than all Traders put together.
6261 2018-03-24 23:23:00 Bullied, you can’t take being bullied while kids diefrom assault rifles, bump stocks. Boo hoo you POS.
6262 2018-03-24 23:22:03 The only reason you agree to the ban on bump stocks is because the N.R.A. gave you permission to do so. You are bought and paid for by the N.R.A. !!!
6263 2018-03-24 23:21:51 1. I know what bump stocks are. 
2. Seems like ur getting ur information from Trump’s tweets
3. Obama did not LEGALIZE bump stocks, ATF APPROVED bump stocks during Obama era because they couldn’t prohibit it. 
4. This isn’t about who’s the better president when kids are dying.
6264 2018-03-24 23:21:26 So... a fair number of energy stocks are actually doing rather fine this March... which I think might surprise some. Technically, some are offering default upside of a rather significant amount, such as $APC and $PBR.
6265 2018-03-24 23:21:19 No automatic weapons used in school shootings no machine guns, meanwhile Trump is moving on outlawing bump stocks FYI
6266 2018-03-24 23:21:01 Exactly!!  They need to address the dems also!!!  I don't see them attempting to pass any legislation in gun control!  At least Trump is putting somethings out there, like the big one, bump stocks!!
6267 2018-03-24 23:20:37 Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns. by #scottadamsshow
6268 2018-03-24 23:20:30 Banning assualt weapons, bump stocks, and limiting magazine capacities doesn’t even infringe on the second amendment.
6269 2018-03-24 23:20:01 @marcorubio please, don't discount the message,it isn't about banning all guns, its about banning assault rifles,bump stocks conversion kits, enhanced checks,mental health etc. Are the students in worth $1.05 each? Kids support 2nd amendment just not the NRA
6270 2018-03-24 23:19:56 And you would be breaking the law  stricter enforcement of the existing laws along with raising the age to  21 for all guns and eliminating bump stocks are all reasonable answers IF enforced as the existing laws should be and information is shared on the mental health issues.
6271 2018-03-24 23:19:31 Stop lying. Only Congress can make legislation, and they did not legalize bump stocks. You however signed a law allowing mentally ill people to buy guns.
6272 2018-03-24 23:18:46 When we do it again, we need to fill our stocks. Can't fight without bananas 
6273 2018-03-24 23:17:34 My stocks are flying through the God damn roof, son.
6274 2018-03-24 23:17:26 I realized trading stocks isn’t as easy as it looks, but its getting easier and easier. I still can’t control the heart pounding n nerves going crazy but I can deal with it.. 
6275 2018-03-24 23:16:47 See, this is why you’ll make a great journalist! Research is vital!  Automatic weapons are harder to get, but things like bump stocks that convert other weapons are not so much. That seems like a good place to start for me. The average handgun isn’t the prob!
6276 2018-03-24 23:16:40 Sorry assault riffles & bump stocks not hand guns & hunting riffles ;-)
6277 2018-03-24 23:15:45 .@realDonaldTrump  Actually, the law did not permit the Obama administration to prohibit bump stocks, according to former ATF officials.
6278 2018-03-24 23:15:34 Oh not even there leader can control his tweets but it’s not so much about arms more about assault riffles not hand guns & bump stocks
6279 2018-03-24 23:15:05 While you play garbage word games over “automatic” folks w bump stocks or a metal file are able to make commonly available weapons spray bullets into schools & kill kids at a horrific rate.
6280 2018-03-24 23:14:57 I'm sorry, I AM Pro 2nd!!! Most of what they are saying would have stopped what happened. YES, take away bump stocks (if you have a class 3, you don't need them. I honestly do NOT believe that ANY civilian needs a fully automatic). YES, raise the age requirements in all states..
6281 2018-03-24 23:14:50 Why do we need bump stocks?  I don't think we need them any more than we need drum magazines, why would we?
6282 2018-03-24 23:13:47 You had 8 years to do something. And now your inspired? Really? What is wrong with you? You and your wife are the "Shame of America" Go away and let the @POTUS solve the problems you couldn't and the problems you created. LIke legalizing Bump Stocks!
6283 2018-03-24 23:13:45 Republicans? What did YOU do when Dems had White House AND Congress? I don’t recall you introducing legislation to ban bump stocks, AR-15s or high capacity magazines. Or tougher background checks? A little LATE with the criticism, don’t you think? And accept some of the blame!
6284 2018-03-24 23:13:41 Bump stocks, the NFA of 1934, the Hughes ammendment in 1986.
6285 2018-03-24 23:13:14 They are not protesting to take away guns or for “freedoms” to be taken away. They believe in the right to bear arms. Don’t twist this into something it’s not. They want military grade weapons and bump stocks banned. They want common sense gun laws to reduce gun violence.
6286 2018-03-24 23:13:05 Got 2 stocks on my watch list so far 1 short 1 long. #pennystocks #watchlist
6287 2018-03-24 23:12:50 All of you scare me! The dems have no guts-ban, bumper stocks, high capacity magazines & assault weapons; one does not need them to hunt
6288 2018-03-24 23:12:48 Bump stocks arming teachers. Just Token ideas that do nothing you think the kids and the voting public will fall for that crap get with it and do the right thing. Your lies will not wash out
6289 2018-03-24 23:12:21 I'm not a fan either, but I don't see what is gained by banning bump stocks. There's only been one mass shooting involving bump stocks, and that shooter would have been more accurate, and deadly if he didn't use em. This ban solves nothing and might cost Trump some support.
6290 2018-03-24 23:12:12 Not even the newspaper stocks have pulled that off! 
6291 2018-03-24 23:11:31 @stocks_william
6292 2018-03-24 23:11:29 Since "Outlaw Assault Rifles, Bump Stocks, and Keep Guns out of the Hands of Violent People" won't fit on a banner, I would suggest that you take the time to listen to the speakers before writing off the movement based on the name of the march alone.
6293 2018-03-24 23:11:28 And those rifles with burst are also illegal
Hence why we can't buy M16s

We need to focus on closing loopholes like gunshow and bump stocks
We need to require training to buy guns
We need a stronger mental health background system
6294 2018-03-24 23:11:21 If there's one thing I learned from a pre-mature run like $OWCP... It's to be realistic and take profits. It's fine to hold stocks you believe in, but when they run far & high that early on... It's not going to last.

$FUSZ has potential, but it's a highly competitive market.
6295 2018-03-24 23:11:16 @stocks_william @Phillis73010045
6296 2018-03-24 23:11:04 Wait... but didn’t Trump just restrict bump stocks without Congress passing a new law?
6297 2018-03-24 23:10:52 Still don’t understand how RFW has anything to do with weapons built ONLY to kill, with bump stocks and large magazines.
6298 2018-03-24 23:10:46 Your bosses do, and did. Same thing with the #GOPTaxScam & ObamaCare repeal. You all are laughing stocks. 

Cannot wait until November.
6299 2018-03-24 23:10:08 If I could invest in musicians like stocks I would invest in @AnneMarie. She's going to be a household name by this time next year. 
6300 2018-03-24 23:09:49 Trump's plan: bump stocks illegal. Billions for background checks laws to finally do what is already law, billions for Mentally ill laws which are already law, and billions for hardening schools, already in states laws.
6301 2018-03-24 23:09:46 NRA is blamed for their strong lobby stopping sensibile gun c ontrol. I own guns and am open to background checks, smart guns, no bump stocks, and no AR-15s. I hunt. I do not need or want weapons of war. Why do you?
6302 2018-03-24 23:09:45 You're an idiot... you don't even know what a bump stock is. Bump stocks do not make weapons full auto, if you knew the first thing about guns, you'd know that. They're to make it easier for people with recurring shoulder injuries to be able to fire a rifle. Idiot
6303 2018-03-24 23:09:26 I just caught the tail end of one of the marches today. They talked about high capacity magazines. The Lakeland shooter use 10 round mags. The NRA bears no responsibility with the shooting. Plus Obumass signed off on bump stocks. So there blame on both sides
6304 2018-03-24 23:07:50 Do bump stocks add to killing time/efficiency ratio?
6305 2018-03-24 23:07:31 Lay-man’s terms: “we got rid of bump stocks, will circle back after the next mass shooting.” Government officials playing kick the can with lives of their constituents.
6306 2018-03-24 23:07:29 He's been selling stocks like mad. He knew it was coming.
6307 2018-03-24 23:07:15 Not true. Obama did not legalize bump stocks.
6308 2018-03-24 23:07:14 oh & also, "selective fire is not for sale to civilians" not a true statement. yes selective fire are available in US for legal purchase (state dependent) and then there are bump stocks....
6309 2018-03-24 23:06:47 You need fully automatic weapons and bump stocks to hunt the dumbest animal ever tho
6310 2018-03-24 23:06:28 I grew up in a rural area. Everyone hunts and owns guns including me. Know what we don't own? Bump stocks or military grade assault weapons.
6311 2018-03-24 23:06:21 They have been offered to be bought out a few times but they declined. Both sean and kory hold a big chunk of stock so they will do whats in the best interest of shareholders. Keep $n $nxttf on your radar
6312 2018-03-24 23:06:16 No doubt we'll get the greedy wall Street traders who are really traitors who hate America selling stocks n shares to undermine the real American President for a dollar from Soros
6313 2018-03-24 23:06:13 This is a lie. 

The Obama administration didn't legalize bump stocks. 

Obama issued EOs creating stricter controls (all of which Trump has rolled back), but could not legally restrict (non mechanical) bump stocks without new laws. Congress refused.
6314 2018-03-24 23:06:09 I'm pretty sure they are, dear. FOR sensible gun laws, FOR a ban on military weapons in the hands of civilians, FOR a ban on bump stocks and high-capacity magazines, FOR background checks with teeth, FOR closing gun show loopholes... need I go on?
6315 2018-03-24 23:04:58 How about just banning guns? That would be a game changer! Bump stocks my arse.
6316 2018-03-24 23:04:44 I do hope these kids do make a difference..however they need to look at all aspects of these horrific tragedies! Bump stocks, AR-15, mental health ignorance, the authorities that ignore signs, legal age to buy, Bullying, social media!There is a bigger picture! It’s not cut & dry!
6317 2018-03-24 23:04:44 My son took a gun and put it to his head and pulled the trigger. No more assault weapons. And it is not good enough to talk bump stocks. #AssaultWeaponsBan #VetsForGunReform
6318 2018-03-24 23:04:20 None of you can defend yourselves even a little@should the “government” decide to turn tyrannical.  But they won’t, because we are the government on that level.  If the Military decides to attack the citizenry all the bump stocks in the world aren’t gonna help
6319 2018-03-24 23:03:52 Let's remember the second amendment was written when you had to reload a musket to take a second shot. Founding fathers said literally nothing about bump stocks, or automatic rifles.  I got a 5 on AP US History,  I'd know if they had.
6320 2018-03-24 23:03:10 Liar.  The Obama administration did not legalize bump stocks. They were always legal from the manufacturer until the mass shooting in Las Vegas brought their existence to the forefront by way of American news media. Can't you ever tell the truth about anything?
6321 2018-03-24 23:02:40 President Obama did not “approve” the sale of bump stocks.  The law simply did not permit them to prohibit them. There is a difference...
6322 2018-03-24 23:02:37 Just to get you up to speed, the Obama administration did not legalize bump stocks.  And also, lying is a BAD IDEA.
6323 2018-03-24 23:02:36 Funny todays tweet from u is lets not make this about politics Biden created no gun zones @BarackObama  made Bump stocks legal Trump introduced plan2 ban them While u moan about clear backpacks  ur rights Suck it up u asked 4 it  Hate losing ur rights but willing2 take other ppls
6324 2018-03-24 23:02:10 Senator, a “gun ban” isn’t what people want. Assault weapons have no place, outside of the military. Even veterans say this. We have over 300 million guns in this country! We want gun regulations that have teeth. Huge magazines, bump stocks, tighter background checks: a start.
6325 2018-03-24 23:00:42 Just the facts sir, if you’re going to make a fool of yourself tweeting. The least you can do is tweet true facts. President Obama did not legalize bump stocks
6326 2018-03-24 23:00:27 Confidence in stocks and not the country is what determines the price. Uncertainty always leads to a drop.
6327 2018-03-24 23:00:24 Absolute lie. Obama never legalized bump stocks. More propaganda from a President that doesn’t read.
6328 2018-03-24 22:58:39 Your statement doesn't cut it. If the majority want assault weapons, bump stocks and any guns that spew lots if bullets to kill lots of people in a matter of seconds banned then that is what should be done. Of in doubt take a nation wide vote.
6329 2018-03-24 22:58:02 Stop lying! You know Obama never legalized bump stocks.
6330 2018-03-24 22:57:56 Get rid of assault weapons and there would be no need for bump stocks.
6331 2018-03-24 22:57:55 Bump stocks and the age of purchase is like tossing bread crumbs.  Ban military assault weapons from use on civilian streets.
6332 2018-03-24 22:57:37 If the USD goes down is that bullish for stock, at least nominally?  Except for a few miners, I'm completely out of stocks, just curious.
6333 2018-03-24 22:57:22 Like say, bump stocks?
6334 2018-03-24 22:56:57 @sainsburys I saw some fantastic money being raised for sport relief at regents road Salford Sainsbury’s today! Good job guys! Loved throwing a sponge at the guy in stocks 
6335 2018-03-24 22:56:30 Wheter you believe in TA or not you should watch and support @ChartGuys for #crypto and #stocks. Great analysis and awesome people.
6336 2018-03-24 22:56:24 Trump's plan: bump stocks illegal. Billions for background checks laws to finally do what is already law, billions for Mentally ill laws which are already law, and billions for hardening schools, already in states laws.
6337 2018-03-24 22:56:21 Wait for it.Reading the writing on the wall the NRA is going to spend millions on research to weaponize and propagandize those boxes of rocks that a central Pennsylvania school district wants to distribute in classrooms to combat gun violence. Their slogan: Bump Stocks for Rocks!
6338 2018-03-24 22:56:02 Let’s compromise. Keep your bump stocks and let’s ban large capacity magazines.
6339 2018-03-24 22:55:16 Trump's plan: bump stocks illegal. Billions for background checks laws to finally do what is already law, billions for Mentally ill laws which are already law, and billions for hardening schools, already in states laws.
6340 2018-03-24 22:54:46 A bump stocks can be made with a belt.
6341 2018-03-24 22:54:33 Seems Trump enjoyed banning bump stocks and has also made it possible fir pigs to searcg comments in the cloud so that they can come to your house and arrest you without a warrant.
6342 2018-03-24 22:54:21 Per 36, Cam Payne is averaging 15-4-7 with 2.8 stocks, only 2 turnovers, and 39% from three in 15 games this season. The Bulls are seven points better when he's on the floor. He looks like a really good 3 & D caretaker point guard.
6343 2018-03-24 22:54:01 Lies lies lies.... 
Obama's admin didn't legalize bump stocks. Every order Obama issued  creating stricter controls Trump has rolled back!!
6344 2018-03-24 22:53:40 Local stocks fell below the 8,000 mark anew on Friday as a brewing US-China trade war spooked global markets.
The main-share PSEi tumbled by 153.65 points or 1.89% to close at 7,970.80. About P1 billion worth of foreign funds exited the stock market during the day.

6346 2018-03-24 22:52:22 In 2010 the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives determined that because bump stocks don't have any moving parts, they are a "firearm part" and could not be regulated as a firearm under existing gun laws. The ATF reached a similar conclusion in 2012. Not Obama.
6347 2018-03-24 22:51:58 That's from 2016 bub Obama isn't president anymore but trumps DOJ just moved to ban bump stocks why not post about that snowflake?

6350 2018-03-24 22:51:16 You cannot control this government with the weapons average citizens can purchase. The government has drones, bombs, tanks, etc. They only way to to control them is by voting in the right candidates. Ban assault weapons and bump stocks.
6351 2018-03-24 22:50:28 Another LIE! Its all you do...

Obama DID NOT legalize bump stocks.

Resign or go to prision you lying sack of • • • •
6352 2018-03-24 22:50:05 Did you hear that punk kid say that since they ban bump stocks " give us an inch we will take a mile"..What the hell is going on with these punk kids? @DLoesch @NRA @MrColionNoir #NRALIFEMEMBER
6353 2018-03-24 22:50:02 LIAR, LIAR! On Feb 17, 2017; YOU repealed Obama's era-regulation that would have made it easier to BLOCK the sale of Bump Stocks & firearms to people with certain mental illness. (like YOU)
6354 2018-03-24 22:49:00 Actually, the Obama administration's ATF lawyers determined the law as written by Congress categorized bump stocks as "firearm parts," and not "firearms,," and, therefore not subject to regulations as firearms.  This occurred in 2010 and 2012.
6355 2018-03-24 22:48:56 The NRA begged the Obama administration to strictly regulate the sale of bump stocks.... we were ignored.
6356 2018-03-24 22:48:50 Buy and hold stocks was a thing before crypto though, so nothing new here  #cryptocurrency
6357 2018-03-24 22:48:33 You gave 2 examples. Private sales (high volume) and bump stocks. I brought up involuntary treatment for some mental illnesses which you didn't address. I honestly want to how you think these can be resolved
6358 2018-03-24 22:48:27 You're welcome. I updated a complete Gold stock chart list. If you want the list I have one with prices above $0.70 (200 stocks) and one with $0.01(400 stocks) just DM me with your stockcharts account email and tell me which one.
6359 2018-03-24 22:47:57 @KenCuccinelli let’s cut the rhetoric out & just agree semi-automatic, bump stocks & automatic weapons belong in the hands of the military & law enforcement. Full stop! Tons of new voters, willing to vote U all out, will B coming after U unless U respond 2 this issue responsibly.
6360 2018-03-24 22:47:51 Let me get this right, you legalized bump stocks and now you are anti-gun all of a sudden? Typical democratic hypocriticy....
6361 2018-03-24 22:47:33 It wouldn’t take the guns from the cops, moron. They’re a well regulated militia. the people of the US aren’t. people do not deserve the right to have accessibility to weapons that are designed for war zones (e.g AR-15s). Nor high capacity magazine clips, or bump stocks.
6362 2018-03-24 22:47:32 @SenateGOP Get to work NOW! or get out. No sales: assault weapons, bump stocks, high-capacity ammo. Repeal Dickey. No guns under age 21. “15-to-24-yr olds are 49 times more likely to die from guns in the U.S. than other wealthy countries” - Time Mag. Tough gun laws SAVE LIVES!
6363 2018-03-24 22:46:42 If Obama has used an executive order to ban bump stocks the republican congress would have initiated impeachment proceedings before the ink was dry.
6364 2018-03-24 22:46:11 @realDonaldTrump you say Obama legalized bump stocks, WRONG! Let's talk about Eric Trump raising money for st. Jude research and how he stole it. Let's talk about how corrupt your family is. How you don't pay your bills, let's talk about that.
6365 2018-03-24 22:45:55 Why can’t we work on background checks, instead of banning bump stocks. I’m fine with working on stricter background checks, but banning bump stocks is crossing the line. That is breaking the 2nd amendment!
6366 2018-03-24 22:45:39 Hump stocks 
6367 2018-03-24 22:45:17 There you go, trying to be relevant. You aren’t. SAD.
Disarming the citizenry of AR-15s, bump stocks, mega round capacity clips, is not a first step to oppression & tyranny. What part of “well REGULATED militia” don’t you get? Hint, REGULATED being the key word here.
6368 2018-03-24 22:44:31 @realDonaldTrump.. No comments about March For Our Lives Today. Cat got your dirareah tongue?? Ban bump stocks..comprehensive nationwide background checks!!!#NeverAgain#MSDSTRONG is a freight train you cannot stop. Today is only the begining.
6369 2018-03-24 22:43:59 What a completely stupid ignorant idea & a slap in the face to the cries for change Of our gun laws to reduce gun violence and death By just banning bump stocks what a complete Senseless joke Instead of banning the problem the actual semi automatic assault style rifles how Lame!
6370 2018-03-24 22:43:47 Nobody wants school or ANY GUN VIOLENCE, however! And it terrible!
There really is nothing that will totally stop it.
Background checks?
Im sure ok with that, but some of these other ideas?
Bump stocks? Never seen one and you could not guve me such junk
Confiscate? IMPOSSIBLE!!
6371 2018-03-24 22:43:22 Do criminals and kids that plan to inflict damage care about background checks, gun free signs, bump stocks, or laws in general? #AskingForAFriend #GunControlForDummys #GunControl #SecondAmendment #
6372 2018-03-24 22:42:58 That is beautiful Donald but what about right here in America.  Maybe you didn't know the nation's children are begging 4 assault weapons bans. You keep talking about BUMP STOCKS. A bump stock is of no use if there's no weapon 2 install it on.  And you're supposed 2 be a genius?
6373 2018-03-24 22:42:45 Someone's been pretty quiet about stocks also.
6374 2018-03-24 22:42:28 @cnnbrk  WAKE UP. 
Trump coughing up to ban Bump Stocks. BFD
YouTube has plenty of instructional videos of how to Bump Fire a semiautomatic rifle without a Bump Stock. 
It's not the stocks it's, the weapon and capacity that are the culprits.
6375 2018-03-24 22:42:12 This rule  about bump stocks is a fake and you know it - it takes Congressional legislation as ATF has told us multiple times... Weak and tansparent lie.
6376 2018-03-24 22:42:04 Should we start to call bump stocks Trump stocks?
6377 2018-03-24 22:41:38 Obama issued EOs creating stricter controls (all of which Trump has rolled back), but could not legally restrict (non mechanical) bump stocks without new laws. Congress refused.
6378 2018-03-24 22:41:11 Please.  Please.  This is a ridiculous comment.  We know about bump stocks and increased capacity magazines.  We know how many bullets can come out of an AR-15 in one minute vs. a musket.  Nice try.
6379 2018-03-24 22:40:46 you know that nothing is to come of this unless potus signs bill for bump stocks and you start locking up crazy people
6380 2018-03-24 22:40:34 Apple also gained 15 points in a month so look at it that way.  It will soon be a good time to buy more.  It’s only 7 bucks to sell so some stocks might be time to sell and preserve capital so you can buy lower.
6381 2018-03-24 22:40:20 The Obama administration didn't legalize bump stocks. 

Obama issued EOs creating stricter controls (all of which Trump has rolled back), but could not legally restrict (non mechanical) bump stocks without new laws. @GOP controlled Congress refused.
6382 2018-03-24 22:39:59 the laws we have let a man acquire an arsenal with bump stocks to shoot 200 people in less than 10 minutes
6383 2018-03-24 22:39:56 And think about it Obamas ATF allow bump stocks in 2010 and 2012
6384 2018-03-24 22:39:38 @realDonaldTrump nice try on the Bump stocks... that will not distract us this time... tell Wayne baby and the members of congress taking his BLOOD MONEY, their 15 minutes runs out this November...
6385 2018-03-24 22:39:34 Mr President, I voted for you to protect Americans against dangers to our lives. I think you have sold us out. Forgetting our 2nd amendment rights and bending to the fake news and Democrats. And now banning bump stocks. I am very disappointed.
6386 2018-03-24 22:39:13 Just curious, honestly, but if they determined it couldn’t be regulated why not ban bump stocks?
6387 2018-03-24 22:38:35 #DimwitDonny bump stocks were never made “legal” because they were never illegal.  The BATF said under current law they were legal. You see traitorous dimwit we are a country of laws and the courts rule according to those laws. You would think the president would know this.
6388 2018-03-24 22:38:31 Obama did not legalize bump stocks. Congress would not let him make them illegal. So, let me get this straight. You want to ban all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal ones.  But, you don't want to make assault rifles illegal, like the ones used in most school shootings.
6389 2018-03-24 22:37:57 Agree. Many who are not these kids you think are not experienced will VOTE and your bump stocks will be gone and your semi automatic weapons will be gone. Oh, you'll still have that good old 2nd amendment. If we ever need a militia.
6390 2018-03-24 22:37:55 I haven't seen anyone proposing literally taking guns away from people. Most people are suggesting legislation like better mental health and background checks, limiting the kinds of automatic firearms future buyers can get legally, making bump stocks illegal, etc.
6391 2018-03-24 22:37:39 @realDonaldTrump what are you going to do to support gun control? We need more than just getting rid of bump stocks!
6392 2018-03-24 22:37:23 Really wish i invested in woke stocks.
6393 2018-03-24 22:37:21 @MittRomney @CNNnewsroom mitt will you come out and endorse universal background checks prior to gun sale and a ban on automatic weapons and bump stocks?  @fox13
6394 2018-03-24 22:35:46 You made the point that all the gun deaths were .04% of the population. I illustrated all we have done for a death toll of 1/1000th of our population. It isn’t hard: ban assault rifles, bump stocks, high capacity magazines. 3 day waiting period. Comprehensive background checks...
6395 2018-03-24 22:35:44 Doing what? Banning bump stocks?That’s a given. Do something constructive. Do background checks a shows would be a good start. Your party is pathetic 
6396 2018-03-24 22:35:19 Politifact: In 2012 the Bureau Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives determined that bump stocks are a "firearm part" and could not be regulated as a firearm under existing gun laws. Adam Winkler, a constitutional law prof stated "the law did not permit them to prohibit it,"
6397 2018-03-24 22:35:03 No. Other way around. The stock market crash is the trigger for the switcheroo on Monday. Its ready started thanks to the whole trade war charade. Headlines will read: "stocks crash due to trade war jitters". But it's because the cabal's pockets are being rinsed.
6398 2018-03-24 22:34:46 “Sex Work” stocks just plummeted. Guess you lazy asses will have to get a real job 
6399 2018-03-24 22:34:41 He signed a bill to ban bump stocks today.....what did you do....
6400 2018-03-24 22:34:04 @stocks_william @cookseyboi12
6401 2018-03-24 22:33:26 Weather fine here at Madera! First main event rolling now. Opening ceremonies still at 4 pm with Hobby Stocks, Legends, LM, and SRL features after that!
6402 2018-03-24 22:32:58 I'm not a gun person, but anybody thinks the stops at assault rifles and bump stocks is out of their mind.

Criminals will still have guns. Criminals will still kill people. There will be nobody to stand against them besides the police that come too late, always too late.
6403 2018-03-24 22:31:55 All our guns have bump stocks lmao
6404 2018-03-24 22:31:16 I can agree to an extent regarding Vegas. I'm all for getting rid of bump stocks. Also agree with fixing background checks, as well as suspension of 2A rights if under domestic investigation.
I'm even ok with limiting the number of arms a person can own. 
I'm not ok with banning
6405 2018-03-24 22:30:53 I think there is sensible things that can be done. Ban bump stocks. Trump is already doing that. Tougher background checks? Ok fine but all that is doing is making it more of a hassle for law abiders. Does nothing to stop a criminal. I think our main focus should be make schools
6406 2018-03-24 22:30:33 Banning bump stocks is not protecting the 2nd amendment. It's rewarding liberal protests.
6407 2018-03-24 22:30:20 Sen. Rubio: your statement is purposely misleading. Today’s demonstrations are not about a ‘gun ban’. They’re about banning high-powered military type weapons, bump stocks, high capacity magazines, & more stringent background checks. That’s all. Pls issue a correction.
6408 2018-03-24 22:30:19 “Gonna retire in a year”....stocks are to owned during retirement!
6409 2018-03-24 22:30:18 @HouseGOP Every legislator MUST take action NOW!  
 - Ban bump stocks (DUH!!)
 - Repeal Dickey amendment
 - Fund gun violence research
 - Enact extreme risk protection orders
 - No gun sales under age 21
 - Make owning a gun as tough as driving a car: training & testing...(1/2)
6410 2018-03-24 22:30:15 Actually, Obama didn't legalize bump stocks. Not banning something isn't the same as legalizing. But you, you're not fooling anyone,  the NRA still controls your party.  And Putin controls you.
6411 2018-03-24 22:29:35 Banning bump stocks and automatic weapons that were not around when the 2A was created by the Founders takes away no rights that were promised.
6412 2018-03-24 22:29:21 ... Identification and have a background check on you. It also requires many stipulations on it and is stupidly expensive. Further perhaps the reason why bump stocks aren't sold that much is due to it being able to be created with your fingers or a rubber band.
6413 2018-03-24 22:29:16 but let's say passive didn't exist, wouldnt they be doing same "risk creep" w stocks or MFs?
6414 2018-03-24 22:29:11 Trump always has a plan. He's always looking ahead, planning for the future, not for the moment. That's his brilliance. By doing so, he takes care of today, people just don't understand, however, the signs are there. Stocks, jobs, etc. The wall? Look at the numbers it's working!
6415 2018-03-24 22:28:58 Ban bump stocks fine but don’t go to far!!!
6416 2018-03-24 22:27:53 If the economics and stocks crash, won’t it mean we could buy stocks for super cheap and then get hella rich? I’m not an economist so I’m not sure. You might know!
6417 2018-03-24 22:27:44 I agree with Trump and NRA that bump stocks should be banned. Obama wouldn’t do it but I think President Trump will get it done.
Funny how DNC tell you guns bad, oil bad , think sustainable.
They have more guns,use way more oil for their many cars and houses.
6418 2018-03-24 22:27:38 This whole thing really really reeks of corruption. The FED just raised rates and yet the financial stocks are being hit harder than anything else. This looks very suspicious. And why is Healthcare being hit so hard? It's practically perfectly domestic.
6419 2018-03-24 22:27:37 Bump Stocks do not effect the fire rate, nor the operation of any kind of rifle. To think so, is rather quixotic.
6420 2018-03-24 22:27:33 But then again High capacity magazines, bump stocks, and lack of proper regulations make guns a big part of the issue.
6421 2018-03-24 22:27:32 Our "Glorious Leader" waited until the NEXT shooting event to address bumper stocks. Apparently he is waiting for the NEXT shooting to address the AR-15.
6422 2018-03-24 22:27:10 Can yall stop hating snapchat. I bought stocks thinking yall was gonna use it more...DO YALL KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY IVE LOST?
6423 2018-03-24 22:27:07 HA! Don't disagree with that at all, & the use of the word 'sanctimonious' is spot on! Nevertheless, he was the 1st President to try. However, given the public displays today, think Trump will be forced into something. Alas, prob only 'Bump Stocks' being made illegal... for now!
6424 2018-03-24 22:26:47 Banning bump stocks isn't far enough Trump raise the gun buying age to 21 how many kids need to die
6425 2018-03-24 22:26:38 Obama issued executive orders restricting bump stocks, which you have since dissolved. Wanted to do more but Congress refused. Need to check your facts Stable Genius.
6426 2018-03-24 22:26:16 They have a list of demands Ms Ditzy.

Ban tactical rifles, ban bump stocks, limit magazine size, increase waiting period, raise legal age to 21, require background checks on all gun purchases.....

Sounds like they have a lot of stuff they are FOR!
6427 2018-03-24 22:26:10 @ukgap Feel I'm being unfairly treated as I need uneven waist size but cannot buy jeans in my size @ local store (Brighton) as it only stocks even sizes. And to top it off you are charging £5 more online...
6428 2018-03-24 22:25:41 @drjjr500 U got to be kidding, another Trump embarrassing insulting Lie abt FN Bump Stocks is all he can tweet, shows America that and Greedy NRA Owned GOP are so Stupid, Greedy & Out of Touch!! They still dont realize their time & thr Party of Crooks lying to ppl is Over forever
6429 2018-03-24 22:25:24 Do we say all Private Sellers must go to a place and the buyer has to take a background check and if they don't and that gun is used in a crime whoever that gun is registered to is held responsible? Do we ban Bump Stocks? All these things I am okay with and will support.
6430 2018-03-24 22:25:18 I don’t disagree. I’m more interested in a ban on accessories that make guns MORE deadly than they already are. High capacity magazines, bump stocks, etc. Why do civilians need high capacity magazines? I don’t think they do.
6431 2018-03-24 22:24:33 The Vegas shooter had something like 20+ semi-automatic rifles with modifications and high capacity magazines.. it should have raised red flags.. the only reason you have that many guns modified to be nearly fully automatic via bump stocks is to kill a lot of people.. period.
6432 2018-03-24 22:24:25 Bump Stocks and Guns are not the problem .   White Male Terrorist ( Skin Heads ,Neo - Nazis , KKK members ) are the problem in America.  They stockade Guns all across America and they are Crazy like you Donald Trump....
6433 2018-03-24 22:24:14 Well crafted speech. Future politician. I guess our current President going against the NRA and banning bump stocks was belittled as inconsequential. No one before him did that. Remember, politicians themselves were gunned down last year, they are trying.
6434 2018-03-24 22:24:04 Sack him & send them all to the stocks no wonder they won the ashes & I thought it was because we were bad..no wonder the ball used to swing late on cheating s---..
6435 2018-03-24 22:23:32 it’s impossible because bump stocks aren’t firearms and therefore can’t be regulated unless congress creates new laws banning them.
6436 2018-03-24 22:23:31 Legislation regarding bump stocks isn’t going too help. With any semi auto weapon you can bump fire it by hanging your thumb in your belt loop and pushing the weapon away from you causing it to fire in rapid fashion. It’s called bump firing ... YouTube it
6437 2018-03-24 22:22:57 The question can maybe delve into what rights should be protected and how? Individual vs the group in a sense.

For example, if we had restrictive measures regarding firearms, would gun owners be willing to compromise on that reasonably? Do we need semi-auto weapons? bump stocks?
6438 2018-03-24 22:22:24 I am for banning all semiautomatic rifles, bump stocks, high capacity magazines.  I am for stronger background checks, required classes (like drivers ed, but must be renewed somewhat frequently), mental health evaluations, longer waiting period, closing existing loopholes
6439 2018-03-24 22:22:09 Precisely.
Just like slavery.
And child marriage.
And the stocks.
And debtor's prison.
And cigarettes.
6440 2018-03-24 22:21:55 This is about a whole lot more than bump stocks. This is about the NRA being fine with millions of untraceable assault weapons being held by individuals with no training, no vetting, and in many cases, no mental capacity to understand the consequences of their use.
6441 2018-03-24 22:21:51 No more dead kids. Ban assault weapons, large magazines, bump stocks. Fix gun show loopholes. Pass trigger guards that prevent anyone other than it's owner to shoot.
6442 2018-03-24 22:21:41 Plus this dicking with the stock market ... is that so certain people can come in and scoop up prime stocks at bargain basement prices?
6443 2018-03-24 22:21:39 The AR15s are pistols? I didn't know pistols could fire off 300 rounds in a minute. Can pistols use bump stocks?
6444 2018-03-24 22:21:38 Evidently you haven't check your stocks this week... an unstable president makes for an unstable stock market.
6445 2018-03-24 22:20:28 Yet he helped murder all those people in Vegas by making bump stocks legal. #ObamaTheHypocrite @BarrackObama is Liberal idiocy 101
6446 2018-03-24 22:20:25 Once again Trump lies about Obama.  He failed to mention that the republicans owned by the NRA failed to pass any efforts he put forth about bump stocks.  Trump is the most disgusting person and should not be president by any means.  STOP trying to undue and outdue Obama.
6447 2018-03-24 22:20:00 Assault weapons are already banned. Only the military has them. The AR 15 is not an assault weapon anymore than a Ford fusion is a race car. Magazines and bump stocks, yes. The weapon, no.
6448 2018-03-24 22:19:41 Remember a 10-15 percent correction is a good thing for the stock market. I look at it as a buying opportunity. It takes shares down to a better share price for super high P/E stocks and then you will see the buying frenzy.
6449 2018-03-24 22:19:03 Well that is a lie and you know it. Also bump stocks are not the only threat, AR15's and anything like them need to be banned too.
6450 2018-03-24 22:18:56 Alejandro's other grandma and uncle are talking about cryptocurrencies and stocks how fucking... bourgeois
6451 2018-03-24 22:18:46 Stocks are in free fall, only a weaker dollar will slow the decline but as it's fallen 25% in past year or so, don't hold your breath. Gold should outperform
6452 2018-03-24 22:18:36 You don't even know what the marches were about. Banning AR-15s and bump stocks, raising the legal age to own a gun, the other components of gun reform are NOT about banning all guns. You're so well-trained by your NRA bosses that you didn't even mention the 17 people killed.
6453 2018-03-24 22:18:11 Sure did his administration legalized bump stocks in order to help terrorism flourish  in America that is what liberalism does in a democracy so it can aid in the establishment of socialism using fear and hatred amongst the citizens so they will turn on each other
6454 2018-03-24 22:17:13 DON'T KNOW WHY YOU ASK BUT NO, I DON'T USE DRUGS. BUT IF I DID MAYBE THE NRA WOULD SELL ME A AUTOMATIC WEAPON OR TWO? IF YOU THINK I AM SICK AND DON'T DESERVE AN AUTOMATIC, MAYBE I CAN JUST GET BUMP STOCKS? NRA IS GOD IN THIS COUNTRY, RIGHT. WE R MOST DANGEROUS COUNTRY IN WORLD.
6455 2018-03-24 22:16:34 I'm glad to hear Kroger is trying to lower the cost of healthier food...most supermarkets charge a huge markup on organic items and carry limited stocks of organics in their stores in poor neighbourhoods.  But aren't you a bit young to be drinking organic beer??? 
6456 2018-03-24 22:16:33 If you don't think it's a big issue you don't support the same sport as I do.

Simple as that.

Again, change the name from Smith to Root and you would be clamouring for him to be in stocks in the street
6457 2018-03-24 22:15:56 Says the King who gave us BUmp Stocks! Hypocrite do nothing. #RedWave2018
6458 2018-03-24 22:15:23 That first part applies to any proposal, be it armed teachers, school security, gun zones, bump stocks, background checks, legal age, semi automatics, mental health, videogame violence, parenting, and on and on.

We need all of them, but we compromise instead, on our kids' lives.
6459 2018-03-24 22:14:38 You don’t need an AR-15 or bump stocks to defend your family, but I assume you know that statistically you are far more likely to injure or kill a friend or family member than fight off an intruder, right? No one wants your handgun or shotgun though. Chill
6460 2018-03-24 22:14:20 @realDonaldTrump a ban on Bump Stocks means a NO vote for GOP.
6461 2018-03-24 22:14:14 Assault rifles are not a right. Bump stocks are not a right. Being able to buy a weapon without a background check and mental health assessment should not be even close to a right. Nobody wants to take away the second amendment, we want to take away weapons of war on the streets.
6462 2018-03-24 22:14:12 Leave Bump Stocks alone  1st they come for bump stocks next they come for the guns This is a test to see what will happen.
6463 2018-03-24 22:14:06 Bump stocks don't make a firearm any more, or less effective. Trump has not done anything to affect mental evaluations, on any level. To be clear, when you go to purchase a firearm, you have to answer a question, inquiring weather or not, you have ever been judged mentally in fit
6464 2018-03-24 22:13:50 Did they have election hacking by a foreign power in those days when the 2nd was drawn up? Assault rifles and bump stocks? NO. I have to ask- ‘amendment’ by nature means an alteration to an original thing- so why are you all so unwilling to alter an alteration?!?!
6465 2018-03-24 22:13:44 @realDonaldTrump do not ban bump stocks it’s an infringement
6466 2018-03-24 22:13:37 No one legalized bump stocks quit trying to con the people and try to learn facts on matters you tweet for a change! People are sick of it!
6467 2018-03-24 22:13:36 Thank you President Trump for supporting the STOP School Violence Act!!  Not just words, but actions.  Same in bump stocks!
6468 2018-03-24 22:13:29 Remember those bump stocks Obama made legal?
6469 2018-03-24 22:13:24 But did chrome and iOS play a role in the election? Zuckerberg was complicite told everyone a year ago that we were dumb to even suggest that. And today after cashing out stocks the last 3 months into his charity to avoid taxes, he goes, Mistakes we’re made... that’s some BS!!!
6470 2018-03-24 22:13:14 @realDonaldTrump if you want my vote in 2020, Do Not Ban Bump Stocks.
6471 2018-03-24 22:12:03 @realDonaldTrump Ban transgendered not Bump Stocks.
6472 2018-03-24 22:11:49 Spoken at #MarchForOurLives:  Re: bump stocks: "We are not here for bread crumbs; we are here for change." Also: "Stand for us or beware; the voters are coming."
6473 2018-03-24 22:11:16 The left is creating 1000s of new gun owners every time their Marxist zombies take to the streets in protest of our constitutional right to bear arms. Gun stocks will shoot up next week. When I see a bunch of drugged up kids screaming at the sky for me to disarm, I buy more ammo.
6474 2018-03-24 22:11:16 Missing The Point?
Our next generation of Voters is demanding Our Gov't help Create a Safer America by ReInstating Assault Weapons Ban, ReInstate Background Checks for ALL Gun Buyers, Ban Bump Stocks, Ban high Capacity Magazines. FOR Sensible Gun Laws.
6475 2018-03-24 22:11:02 You Should of sold Disney stocks idecades ago. Disney has propagated  the failed intolerant PC Agenda of Progressively Correct Idiocy for decades.
6476 2018-03-24 22:10:49 Proud to see these young folks standing up, and speaking out. As a responsible gun owner, the 2nd Amendment is clear.  "A well-regulated militia"...  Well regulated should mean universal background checks, mental health evals, ban on bump stocks & a ban on military assault guns.
6477 2018-03-24 22:10:45 You defend the 2nd Amendment from those who want to take it away, except from Trump , of course!
He bans bump stocks via executive order and signes an Omnibus bill that has gun control measures in it the same day.
He can do that because he's your guy. More to the left than Obama.
6478 2018-03-24 22:10:19 You seem to be the stupid one here...Obama approved bump stocks and Trump will outlaw them among other Obama era gun laws. Who do you think  signed the gun laws that you want to change? Not Trump...
6479 2018-03-24 22:10:09 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
6480 2018-03-24 22:09:56 Bullshit, you know no one wants to take all guns from law abiding citizens. Just weapons of war, high capacity magazines and bump stocks.
6481 2018-03-24 22:09:31 People sometimes seem at a loss when asked what they want to see changed... Here are some suggestions:
Close the gun show loophole
BAN AR-15 style weapons 
Ban clips bigger than 9 rounds 
Ban bump stocks
Registration, license and insurance to own a gun
#MarchForOurLives
6482 2018-03-24 22:09:25 There was no law against bump stocks. Trump knocked out the law that restricted people with “mental illnesses” from obtaining guns...so...?
6483 2018-03-24 22:09:19 Obama approved bump stocks and Trump will outlaw them among other Obama era gun laws. Who do you think  signed the gun laws that you want to change? Not Trump...
6484 2018-03-24 22:09:18 Says the person, who legalized the bump stocks. Unbelievable. He and his wife have no conscience. I wish, they would just go away. They have done enough damage to our country.
6485 2018-03-24 22:09:11 “I had a long-awaited opportunity to be a dispassionate buyer of companies who's shares had plunged to ridiculously low prices…I had to pick my spots, but I had studied enough to know that this might well be the best time in my entire life to buy stocks” - Guy Spier
6486 2018-03-24 22:08:51 People sometimes seem at a loss when asked what they want to see changed... Here are some suggestions:
Close the gun show loophole
BAN AR-15 style weapons 
Ban clips bigger than 9 rounds 
Ban bump stocks
Registration, license and insurance to own a gun
6487 2018-03-24 22:08:33 How about banning automatic weapons (already done) and those things that make it automatic/bump stocks (not done..not even close). But your to busy cashing your gun industry checks
6488 2018-03-24 22:08:30 He shouldn't ban bump stocks & I didn't like that the NRA was okay with it because The 2nd amendment was primarily included forthe ppl to defend against a tyrannical govt. Truth is it's unconstitutional. If the govt has automatic weapons, the ppl should as well for a fair fight.
6489 2018-03-24 22:07:31 Don't stop tomorrow.
Don't stop on Monday.
Stop, when
Assault rifles are banned
Bump stocks are banned
Multi rounds of amunition are banned
Age for buying guns is 21
Control on buying guns is stricter.

And VOTE in November.
6490 2018-03-24 22:07:30 Trump just banned bump stocks. Gotta give credit where credit is due.
6491 2018-03-24 22:07:17 Ooo bump stocks. Pres is really on the gun control bandwagon...
6492 2018-03-24 22:06:41 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President guns don’t kill people. People kill people. Bump stocks DO NOT make a gun fully automatic. This is simply banning things that look scary to a non-gun owner. @scrowder @benshapiro @Cernovich 2nd Amendment is a right endowed by our creator?
6493 2018-03-24 22:06:41 Merger to take place on Monday!
6494 2018-03-24 22:04:48 Says the guy who approved of “bump stocks”.  Hypocrite....
6495 2018-03-24 22:04:47 If you really believe that I feel sorry for you mate. Trump wants to ban bump stocks, is that pandering to the NRA?
6496 2018-03-24 22:04:16 Finding common ground is easy. Ban assault rifles/bump stocks no one needs such items. Then ensure rigorous background checks are in place whenever a gun is purchased. No one is saying you cant have a gun but certain controls need to be in place. Stand up to help these kids.
6497 2018-03-24 22:03:51 BANNING BUMP STOCKS ARE NOT ENOUGH! NOT ENOUGH I SAY!!  NOT ENOUGH!!! PUT THE BAN BACK ON ALL ASSAULT WEAPONS.
6498 2018-03-24 22:03:42 Obama acknowledged the brave young people today. You didn't  if Obama legalized bump stocks. So what? You reversed every other Obama move
6499 2018-03-24 22:00:46 Oh my god we've both got the same coping method,

I'll make sure my stocks are high, both liquor wise and hangover wise.
6500 2018-03-24 22:00:46 The availability of bump stocks makes chow of your argument.
6501 2018-03-24 22:00:40 If all the kids across america can get their parents to vote against guns then the GOP NRA loving faction would not be in office and we can get real teeth into gun laws. Banning bump stocks was signed by Trump to try to shut these courageous intelligent teens up.
6502 2018-03-24 22:00:15 There are laws on the books across the country banning handheld phone use while driving.  Try again.  How 'bout we start with banning assault weapons, large clips, bump stocks, and make sure there are thorough background checks for all gun sales?
6503 2018-03-24 22:00:01 Overheard at Castle @Gormogons:

Frankly, I don't care about/for bump stocks. Seems like a petulant ass to people at some point? She actually does them. - CZ
#OverheardGormogons
6504 2018-03-24 21:58:56 which leaves open the door for States or the Federal government to ban AR-15 , bump stocks, require registration of all fire arms owned privately
6505 2018-03-24 21:58:51 All we’re asking for is the same common sense that doesn’t allow missiles, tanks, rpgs, etc for private citizens. When mass death is the only purpose, a weapon like the AR-15, bump stocks violates our natural and constitutional right to life.
6506 2018-03-24 21:58:47 I agree no bump stocks. No one needs a full auto gun. But outside of that they just need to enforce the existing laws!
6507 2018-03-24 21:58:26 AK stocks feel a bit too small for me i might just get an AR and build it up

6510 2018-03-24 21:58:00 #VoteThemOut2018 Obama Administration legalized Bump Stocks. Tons of school shootings under Obama and Democrats. You falling for this crap?
6511 2018-03-24 21:57:58 BAN AR15s, bump stocks, extended mags, armor piercing ammo, and lead ammo NOW.
6512 2018-03-24 21:57:30 We are all laughing stocks because we barrack for the cunts. I’m not reading social media, bulletin boards or Facebook groups. Adds to the misery that we are facing. Fucken succession plan. Only can happen at Collingwood. Replace a coach who just got team into 2 Grand Finals.
6513 2018-03-24 21:57:25 SHAME THAT THE CANADIAN HOVERNMENT CONTINUE TO ALLOW THIS BARBARITY TO CONTINUE !
There is a more sinister reason apart from skins and the "Fur Trade" ?

6515 2018-03-24 21:56:43 God didn’t give you the 2A. If you really believe that, then you’re reading the wrong bible. My natural right to the purssuit of happiness doesn’t include bump stocks, assault rifles, high-capacity magazines or any of that other nonsense. Your right doesn’t trump mine.
6516 2018-03-24 21:56:32 Yep. That's one of many reasons I support my local store. Plus the owner stocks special thin-crust for me even tho its not on the menu. He's even made BBQ chicken & spinach feta for me. *special*
6517 2018-03-24 21:56:13 The  2A doesn’t say a thing about AR-15s, bump stocks. If you’re an originalist, muskets are your only option. If you believe in a living Constitution, you realize that there has to be a limit to what it allows. Weaponized drones? Tanks? RPGs? Missiles? Why not?
6518 2018-03-24 21:55:37 Really? What amazes me is you get dumber EVERY DAY! Bump stocks are NOT THE problem, they were used in ONE mass shooting! Assault weapons ARE THE PROBLEM! Auto-hand guns are THE PROBLEM! Assault weapons & auto handguns have been used in EVERY MASS SHOOTING! You miss the point!
6519 2018-03-24 21:55:36 After supporting bump stocks and concealed carry this is the best you have on a day the rest of the world is marching for our lives. You can’t be gone soon enough.
6520 2018-03-24 21:55:35 Weeks ago, I did a grown up thing and purchased a block of stocks. And now I have never been so stressed seeing the value go up and down 
6521 2018-03-24 21:55:33 Also, the easy availability of bump stocks, which can turn semi-auto rifles into automatic rifles. Machine guns are already banned, but bump stocks are legal to sell. That basically means that machine guns really aren't banned at all, as long as the person installs a bump stock.
6522 2018-03-24 21:55:22 The NRA is more likely to give away free assault weapons equipped with bump stocks for those loose screws unable to afford one.  The founding fathers would  have recinded the 2nd Amendment if they had any idea of what horrors the future would bring.
6523 2018-03-24 21:55:09 I'd love lower costs (remember I'm an investor too!) but more regulation pushes up provider and adviser costs not down (yet).
6524 2018-03-24 21:54:41 this is a total lie. He did not legalize bump stocks
6525 2018-03-24 21:53:50 Pensions holding unit trusts will need to reflect break down (i.e. only 'insured' pensions currently exempt; *Caveat* my understanding).

Transparent is (obv) good BUT costs are rising as a result.

The days of (e.g.) 1% AMC long gone, but still question how this improves returns
6526 2018-03-24 21:53:38 Background checks that stick. Banning bump stocks. Removing the gun-show loophole. Taking assault rifles off the market, unless u can explain to me how today's deer are so tough they require multiple rounds to down 'em.

As to ur next statement, I hv no clue what u're getting at.
6527 2018-03-24 21:53:25 You mean banning bump stocks and raising the age to 21. How is the going to stop criminals from getting guns again? This whole Florida shooting was preventable. The local police and the the FBI knew he has mental problems and failed to do anything about it. Completely avoidable
6528 2018-03-24 21:52:52 It once was and maybe again if it's forced out of politics. Most people disagree with it harsh stance of guns, all guns, over people. Although it did agree bump stocks should be banned. Reminds me of when all republicans has to swear to balance the budget now gone.
6529 2018-03-24 21:51:34 It is lagging big time like $gild in pharma sector
6530 2018-03-24 21:51:32 So, As a preemtive move knowing the mass crowd coming to D.C. this administration tells Sessions to look into banning bump stocks, As a response to this March on D.C. its like a feather making a splash in the ocean. No affect.
6531 2018-03-24 21:49:56 Will slow growth in next two years in my opinion. The only reason stocks have increased was due to companies borrowing money for repurchase of shares making increase but top line staying the same
6532 2018-03-24 21:49:53 Who cares why kids have changed. Let the psych figure that one. Ban all assault weapons,large cap magazines & bump stocks. You want to play with these weapons, join the military. No sales of these weapons to Joe blogs except to shoot NRA goons Loesh & LaPiere, worthy cause!!!
6533 2018-03-24 21:49:51 Buy big pharma stocks.  They are running out of pills.
6534 2018-03-24 21:49:28 @paullewismoney isn't talking about investing apparently which is the point I'm therefore stubbornly making.

I don't know what we are talking about other than the FTSE. 

If were looking at the worth of UK companies perhaps GDP more relevant.
6535 2018-03-24 21:49:26 完全に寝坊した
6536 2018-03-24 21:49:19 @AnnCompton Well didn't President Trump also promise to ban bump stocks after the Las Vegas massacre?So the question might be if the Parkland school shooting hadn't happened and all the media focus around it would the President still have ordered all bump stocks be banned?
6537 2018-03-24 21:49:09 Before you praise the former administration it did absolutely nothing when it came to gun control. the  AG cleared the police officers and cities involved in police shootings of unarmed youth. Technically it approved “bump stocks”. Kapernick’s prote started under this admin.
6538 2018-03-24 21:49:05 Doesn’t change fact Obama & dems did nothing in 8 yrs but legalize bump stocks and fight to get killers in urban areas released to kill again. And there was no outrage against him or Dems. Now dems blaming Trump when he did more in 1 year than Obama did in 8 to stop gun violence
6539 2018-03-24 21:48:19 Get it right lying Dump Obama's administration didn't legalise the bump stocks another pathetic lie on your part.
6540 2018-03-24 21:48:13 I guess liberals were right, you look increasingly like a moron. First you sign the horrible OMNIBUS and now you harp on bump stocks. I can bump fire any semi-auto weapon, pistol or rifle, without a bump stock. Are you going to ban my finger?! #DeplorableUnite #Me2A
6541 2018-03-24 21:47:40 "We gotta get rid of these bump stocks,man"-JT
6542 2018-03-24 21:47:07 Universal background checks;
License, registration, insurance;
Improved NCIC technology to speed up background checks;
Magazine capacity limits;
Strict liability crimes for possessing stolen or unregistered guns;
No bump stocks.

Good start, minimally intrusive.
6543 2018-03-24 21:46:57 1 of 2
I’m  just in awe seeing the videos and transcripts of what these “kids” did today in Washington. 

And no matter what your beliefs are about gun control, bump stocks, and the Second Amendment we ALL should remember there’s no age requirement for free speech.
6544 2018-03-24 21:46:29 Banning Bump Stocks,GUNS!!! & Passing NICS doesnt Stop CRIMINALS The Real Problem NOT GUNS!!! #CriminalControlNow
6545 2018-03-24 21:46:28 Pension charges no different to other tax wrappers. Probably cheaper than offshore bond tbf. Otherwise typ no difference. 

Mifid 2 does exactly what you suggest (itemised by provider, adviser, fund cost).
6546 2018-03-24 21:46:12 Sign of good economy is proven on ascending stocks. During Obama's era Dow Jones we took pride in suffered no loss. With due respect Mr President what is happening in your time? Every speech and decisions you make kills Dow Jones more than inflation does

6548 2018-03-24 21:45:51 Trump believe it or not just signed a law to block Bump stocks like the ones used in Las Vegas. They can turn an ordinary gun into the rapid fire weapon. Next is to ban assault type weapons or whatever name you want to call them. There a killing machine
6549 2018-03-24 21:45:23 You are a lieing waste! The republican house passed bumb stocks and it was tied to a bigger bill you moron. God you have no respect for anyone. You think you are so great. I can't wait for the day I can piss on your stone!
6550 2018-03-24 21:45:22 I hate that kids have to worry about guns.
Thst little girl's life should revolve around kittens and glitter, not bump stocks and AR15's.
6551 2018-03-24 21:44:02 CAUGHT IN ANOTHER LIE  In 2010 Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives determined that since bump stocks don't have any moving parts, they are a "firearm part" & could not be regulated as a firearm under existing gun laws. ATF reached a similar conclusion in 2012.
6552 2018-03-24 21:43:55 As a marcher I AM NOT FOR A GUN BAN BUT WAY TO SKEW THINGS.  I’m for sensible gun laws and more stringent guidelines for assault weapons, bump stocks and large capacity magazines.  But you just keep lying Marco.   November is coming...
6553 2018-03-24 21:43:41 I'm just glad we have a fantastic president like @realDonaldTrump, who banned bump stocks after Obama allowed them. @coolbmwm9
6554 2018-03-24 21:43:15 they couldn't even ban bump stocks after Vegas... they'll do nothing and eventually be voted out
6555 2018-03-24 21:42:19 Umm NO! Are you a member? Do you know anything about guns & current gun laws?Do you own a gun? NRA is also ok with banning bump stocks & They don’t want criminals/MI to own guns. Newsflash Bad guys won’t obey new laws they don’t obey law now! How do you plan to stop criminals?
6556 2018-03-24 21:42:03 I personally am all for banning Bump Stocks as with any full auto weapon you need a special license to own a full auto gun. But I can not agree with banning "tactical weapons" as I know less then 1% of shootings are done with a "tactical rifle"
6557 2018-03-24 21:41:56 Bump stocks are going bye bye. I’m on board with that.
6558 2018-03-24 21:41:45 Nobody legalized bump stocks - it was deemed unconstitutional to regulate them when they hit the market - get your facts straight
6559 2018-03-24 21:41:38 Well they also want to ban pistol grips and collapsible stocks, which have no effect on how a gun is fired, which is weird 
6560 2018-03-24 21:41:29 Somewhere, a young Republican sits down to read an online article about a mass shooting and quickly cracks his knuckles and stretches his fingers before explaining to libtards the difference between AR-15s, M4s and what bump stocks are for while entirely missing the point.
6561 2018-03-24 21:41:13 I don't care if you blame the Easter Bunny Dennis. It's time to ban the bump stocks.
6562 2018-03-24 21:41:10 Relax sir, its still a struggle just to get rid of bump stocks (sp?)  There is no possibility they will take away your shotgun or hand guns. 
Also the gov't can take away your rights without force. The power is in the vote,  The enemy is the $ in politics
6563 2018-03-24 21:41:04 I agree the NRA needs to give on SOME reforms—bump stocks, GVROs, and maybe others. I also understand their hesitation on other actions as it’s the old “slippery slope”. They’re hurting their image by not moving, but they’re gaining members because anti-gun is so ridiculous.
6564 2018-03-24 21:40:44 It's taken almost almost 20 years of tickle video watching but I finally found someone who put a set of stocks in a camper, which is an idea I've been toying with since I was a teenager.  Awesome.
6565 2018-03-24 21:40:42 Ok, I'll repeat what's being said a million times now: ban AR-15s & bump stocks, age restriction, severe vetting, mental health screening, licensing, training, certification, universal laws vs state laws.
6566 2018-03-24 21:39:41 26 Bills were entered this 2018 Minnesota Legislative session for public safety against gun violence-none cleared committee-none will pass. No ban on bump stocks. No universal background checks. #VotethemOut #VeteransForGunReform #GunReformNow
6567 2018-03-24 21:39:40 No guns until 21yo
No bump stocks
Ban AR-15s, equivalent guns
Ban multi-shot clips
Ban body-shredding ammo
Universal background checks & gun registration 
“Red flag” restraining orders
No guns if on no fly list
#NoNRA

6568 2018-03-24 21:39:19 $$$$$ is all you are about.  You should be ashamed!!  Bump stocks is NOTHING AND YOU KNOW IT.  GET RID OF THE REST OF THE GUN, NOT JUST THE STOCK!
6569 2018-03-24 21:38:00 Why do you need a tactically accessories on a .22? Sensible for me is banning all semi automatic rifles, banning AR-15s but grandfathering in current owners but they must register it with the federal gov’t and it can not be sold or willed off, ban bump stocks, and more.
6570 2018-03-24 21:37:45 I'm a 2A supporter.  I have rifles, shotguns and handguns.  I carry concealed.  Bump stocks are a novelty, nothing more.  There is no personal protection benefit from a bump stock.  Let's be real here.  We don't need to lay down suppressive fire.
6571 2018-03-24 21:37:31 And that's why they also are pushing to ban bump stocks. There's more to this than you're trying to make it about. You making it seem like we are talking about guns for the fun of it. There's a reason so many people marched today. Because kids are being killed.
6572 2018-03-24 21:37:29 FACT CHECK Obama did not approve Bump Stocks.  His administration simply found that the current LAWS did not prohibit them.  Obama tried for gun control but the GOP pushed back every time

Stop your BLATANT lies! (h/t @krassenstein)
6573 2018-03-24 21:37:19 I've looked at your page--you don't want an answer. You are a mindless Trumpanzee. But if you DID want an answer, I'd tell you I want the AR-15 and bump stocks banned, universal gun laws as opposed to state, licensing, training and insurance, age restrictions, severe vetting...
6574 2018-03-24 21:37:09 Obama had nothing to do with "bump stocks" they just show up on the gun stores like any new product.
Typical troll stuff.... always sowing doubt, misrepresenting the truth, inciting fear and hate, turn people against others, misquoting facts
6575 2018-03-24 21:36:44 
6576 2018-03-24 21:36:37 #2A we aren’t here to take your precious little guns away. We just don’t want weapons of war. We want stronger background checks, mental health checks, and a ban on bump stocks. Righty’s stop being so paranoid! The gov’t isnt coming into your home #MarchForOurLives
6577 2018-03-24 21:36:35 Stocks aren't expenses, it  has no effect on the net income of a business.  Those are assets which affect the total capital of the company.
6578 2018-03-24 21:36:33 Dang bump stocks.....

6580 2018-03-24 21:36:25 No one wants your guns.  They want your assault rifles and bump stocks so you don't become a person who feels the need to use them.
6581 2018-03-24 21:36:24 Bump stocks?
6582 2018-03-24 21:36:10 Lots of the speakers and many signs had specific reasons, simple and reasonable solutions. The chanting is mostly for general ideas and positions that represent a larger group. Plus it's hard to rhyme common sense gun laws and bump stocks in a short sentence
6583 2018-03-24 21:35:59 There is no reason to ban bump stocks, the president already did that. Now what about pistol grips? Do I just cut the pistol grip off my gun in Call it and non assault weapon?
6584 2018-03-24 21:35:52 What part of "well regulated" do you not understand? Banning bump stocks will most likely be the only thing im glad trump has done.
6585 2018-03-24 21:35:46 Nope. Pres. Obama did not legalize bump stocks. 45s a liar plain and simple.
6586 2018-03-24 21:35:10 "I asked people the following questions:

1) Would you be interested in a long-term trend following approach applied to 100 global futures markets that has a sharpe ratio of about 0.6, 10% annual returns, 30% drawdowns, and no correlation to the stocks?  Approx 0% say yes."  EC
6587 2018-03-24 21:34:34 Clearly inflammatory and inaccurate. No one wants to take your rights away just guns of mass destruction/ammo and bump stocks of mass casualty.
6588 2018-03-24 21:34:27 I actually agree with Trump’s decision to ban bump stocks. But he couldn’t leave it at that. He had to distract with a slur and lie about Obama legalizing bump stocks. So glad Obama does not respond to the daily bullying. He’s the bigger man. Well, the only man in this scenario.
6589 2018-03-24 21:34:23 Not saying ban guns,but there is no need for things like 30+ rd mags or bump stocks. Why does everyone assume they will jst get them illegally, like every mass shooter has connections to acquire these things. And wht abt the other shootings, were nothing cld be done before
6590 2018-03-24 21:34:16 OK, here’s some “common sense”  gun reform ideas; Universal Background Checks, Close Gun Show Loopholes, Extend Waiting Periods, Red Flag laws for mental health and domestic violence issues, Ban Bump Stocks, Ban High Capacity Magazines, and yes, Ban Assault Rifles and AR 15s.
6591 2018-03-24 21:33:47 what is this crap about Obama legalizing bump stocks? What is this lunatic talking about, people? Has he slipped over the edge of the 25th Amendment? Actually, he did that long ago. He may decide to #ResignNOW or at least after 60 MInutes, tomorrow.

6593 2018-03-24 21:33:26 Vermont just did this! 

banned bump stocks
expanded federal background checks to all private sales
banned high-capacity magazines
raised age to purchase a gun from 18-21
 overall vote on the bill, 85-59 #MarchForOurLives
6594 2018-03-24 21:33:20 The Obama administration made bump stocks legal. 

 Nice “doing what you could”. 
6595 2018-03-24 21:32:52 @kylewdennis Do you ever put out buy recommendations on OTC Biotech companies or are your recommendations big broad stocks only? Are they recommendations to buy the stock or stock options?
6596 2018-03-24 21:32:22 I'm an advocate for strong gun regulations. Safety regulations are commonplace in the US, but not for guns. I say to my friends/family who own guns: no one is talking about asking away all your guns! We want to talk about bump stocks, 30-50 round mags, and semi automatic rifles.
6597 2018-03-24 21:31:21 Sir, Please do your research on what is a MACHINE GUN....Bump stocks DO NOT make a weapon into a machine gun.  You have to continually pull the trigger while firing a rifle with a bump stock installed.  A machine gun only requires you to pull the trigger ONCE and hold it down.
6598 2018-03-24 21:30:53 The 94 BS ban was for Assault style weapons. Not ARs. The ban included pistol grips, folding stocks, and magazines of more than ten rounds. Semi auto guns were simply sold with fixed stocks and 10 round mags and all was legal.
6599 2018-03-24 21:30:38 @texoriginalpits hey guys I’m trying to find a 24” fire pit locally in Houston. Bucees Katy only stocks 36” currently.  Any ideas? 
6600 2018-03-24 21:30:27 some stocks do not come back
6601 2018-03-24 21:30:06 Last night, the House gave preliminary approval to landmark gun violence protection measures including expanded background checks, a ban on bump stocks, restrictions on magazine size, and an increase in the legal age to purchase a firearm (1/5) #vtpoli
6602 2018-03-24 21:29:48 More Pence Lies. Jobs created are low, minimum wage jobs. More jobs have been lost since the GOP Middle Class Tax Rape was passed than have been created.
Corporations are spending tax savings buying back stocks & paying dividends & not creating jobs. 
Corrupt Republican Congress.
6603 2018-03-24 21:29:34 Try educating yourself on this or really anything before running your mouth Obama dod not legaluze bump stocks amd YOU ended DACA not the dems trying telling the truth at least once in a while
6604 2018-03-24 21:28:56 Rick Vasquez, a former ATF official who took part in the decision to approve bump stocks, told Politifact that to blame the administration implies that Obama or his then-attorney general Eric Holder were involved in the determination.
6605 2018-03-24 21:28:25 Ok, in the case of bump stocks and full auto then yes im talking about ar15 and semi auto handguns. But bump stocks are baned and autos are near imposible to get.
6606 2018-03-24 21:28:16 No more bump stocks and no more trump stocks. Don the con is no better than the politicians you hate. In fact he is the very example of a lying inept disgrace. Bush era war mongers coming back, no wall, new gun laws, Ivanka sitting as Secretary of State. This is the swamp.
6607 2018-03-24 21:28:15 "Not because they liked it, but because the law did not permit them to prohibit it," Winkler told the fact-checking organization, which explored the issue after the National Rifle Associated said the in October that the Obama administration approved bump stocks on two occasions.
6608 2018-03-24 21:27:58 "Bump stocks are being banned. They are devices that turn semi-automatic rifles into fully automatic rifles."
OH REALLY NOW? Frickin tired of the lies that need stations put out.
6609 2018-03-24 21:27:37 how is banning or legislating the heck out of an AR-15 and bump stocks infringement of 2A? These kids don’t want to ban all guns.. they want to make it harder for someone to shoot 20 people in a matter of seconds. Limiting high capacity magazines and AR-15s fixes the problem.
6610 2018-03-24 21:27:34 What part of bump stocks and background checks would disarm police officers? Your outrage seems... Misplaced.
6611 2018-03-24 21:27:17 Trump coughing up to ban Bump Stocks. BFD
YouTube has plenty of instructional videos of how to Bump Fire a semiautomatic rifle without a Bump Stock. 
It's not the stocks it's, the weapon and capacity that are the culprits
6612 2018-03-24 21:26:53 UK,I know. Bump stocks are a joke here. Most people had no idea they existed before Vegas. I shoot a lot and have never even seen one in person. So, my apologies for simply misreading a tweet. Apology accepted for your ignorant misrepresentations of an issue that doesn't affect u
6613 2018-03-24 21:26:52 Sandyhook’s exactly why all these people should hate Obama with a passion. He did nothing after Sandyhook. He actually did worse than nothing. He actually legalized bump stocks. Took Trump to make them illegal. Trump did more against school shootings in one yr than Obama did in 8
6614 2018-03-24 21:26:48 Retweeted Erin (@erigann):

@gamerzerousa @werthe3percent @BobDohertyACP @Heritage I am pro hunter, Bow or rifle...my husband, father, grandfathers, colleagues all served - and are pro gun safety. Don’t need bump stocks to hunt & nothing wrong with background checks
6615 2018-03-24 21:26:46 Then maybe stop telling them their 2a rights are violated by assault weapons ban, bump stocks ban, large mag ban, comprehensive background checks, or gun bans for domestic abuse convictions.

Because having a right to A gun doesn't mean a right to ANY gun under any circumstance.
6616 2018-03-24 21:26:22 Says the guy who legalized bump stocks, presided over fast & furious and who was lax on existing gun laws.
6617 2018-03-24 21:26:21 Bump stocks were here before Trump.
6618 2018-03-24 21:26:18 When you don't make something illegal, you legalize it. Obama's ATF did that twice with bump stocks.
6619 2018-03-24 21:25:25 In 2010 the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives determined that because bump stocks don't have any moving parts, they are a "firearm part" could not be regulated as a firearm under existing gun laws. The ATF reached a similar conclusion in 2012.
6620 2018-03-24 21:25:08 Bump stocks can be made with a belt loop.
6621 2018-03-24 21:24:46 Any gun can be assault weapon. You can anybody with any gun. So they are trying to take all weapons from people. President has it right take bump stocks and all high velocity fully automatic weapons and make illegal. I seen guys kill more people with a knife then 17.
6622 2018-03-24 21:24:43 [Meliora glances to the mage, then back to the mounted knights...then back to the mage...then to the knights again...]

You... you're kidding, right? That's just an old folktale to scare children! Keep this "us" talk up and I could have you all in the stocks for heresy.

6623 2018-03-24 21:24:43 Lawlz, the big snooz
6624 2018-03-24 21:24:35 which stocks would you go for other than your all time favorite, $DIS?
6625 2018-03-24 21:24:21 So misinformed.  If you took@yome@to@eead your aee@it is bump stocks and automatic weapons that were trying to be stopped.  No one wants your Glock, .357, .45  or ‘normal’ Rifles. Only Military should have automatic weapons   Ignorance creates misinformation, hatred and fear.
6626 2018-03-24 21:24:11 If Trump bans bump stocks as he's stated he will and the use of bump stocks was upheld in 2010 and 2012 by Obama's ATF can we acknowledge that or has Newspeak taken that firm a hold?
6627 2018-03-24 21:22:59 This is NRA stupidity! Yesterday a young woman was taken off life support because she was fatally shot at school & another student injured BEFORE SRO COULD HELP THEM! Only solution is sensible gun control-get rid of semi automatics, bump stocks, better background checks etc!
6628 2018-03-24 21:22:01 Thanks for sharing  - I *so* need this...where in the Midlands Stocks it please @tinyrebelbrewco ?
6629 2018-03-24 21:20:57 You misinterpreted my tweet. Trump's the one who said Obama legalized bump stocks. I didn't call you stupid, I called Trump stupid.
6630 2018-03-24 21:20:39 Owning semi-automatic weapons with large magazines and bump stocks is NOT what 2A is about.  2A was for the creation of well-regulated militias so that the states could go after escaped slaves.
6631 2018-03-24 21:20:34 I have a Polski sklep nearby that stocks chilled ready meals from a Szczecin factory. I can taste the freshness but these are on the oily side, quite old-fashioned, "granny style" in a way. I should Take Back Control® and learn the art of bigos-making 
6632 2018-03-24 21:20:33 Adam Winkler, a constitutional law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, told PolitiFact, it's accurate to say the Obama administration approved the sale of bumps stocks. 

"Not because they liked it, but because the law did not permit them to prohibit it,"
6633 2018-03-24 21:20:26 The discussion, in general, is relevant to firearms, not bump stocks. Can you attempt to stay focused long enough to remember the topic?
6634 2018-03-24 21:20:07 Gun show was advertised today in Richland, WA. The purveyors of small arms need to realize fully the reality of the day.  The time has come to ban assault weapons and bump stocks and high capacity magazines.
Tempers are too inflamed in general.
6635 2018-03-24 21:19:21 I mean if people will still have guns, then hey, who cares about bump stocks or rifles? If it's not gonna stop anyone from killing each other, then they won't care if we don't have guns anymore. Glad we can agree!
6636 2018-03-24 21:18:57 KO, I am in favor of and support getting rid of AK’s, bump stocks, raising the age limit, and better background checks. Always have been. But protests aren’t gonna do anything. Message is lost.
6637 2018-03-24 21:18:52 The ATF Technology director determined that bump stocks were not a classification of firearm under the 1968 law, what does Obama have to do with an agency making a determination?
6638 2018-03-24 21:18:41 You people are laughable you get lead around by your freaking nose. Think use your brain matter. Every time Obama did anything with guns you people freaked out and convulsed. Now you blame himfor bump stocks. He couldn't legally ban them and the GOP blocked everything.
6639 2018-03-24 21:18:39 Yet I can achieve an equal rate of fire using a shoe string. Bump stocks are simply an easy target for anti gun people.
6640 2018-03-24 21:18:34 * No bump stocks
* No SARs and ARs for anyone (that's my dream)
 - You have to take special tests to get a CDL license but anyone 18+ can walk into a store and buy an AR-15? They should require a special license and test/waiting period to get an AR15.
6641 2018-03-24 21:18:24 What stocks are you long?
6642 2018-03-24 21:17:58 But to answer your question, your liberty of self defense LITERALLY ENDS when it puts others in danger. It’s in the constitution. Handguns are fine, we don’t want to take them away. But Jeff Sessions and Trump are banning bump stocks.
6643 2018-03-24 21:17:44 Mandatory psychiatric evaluations, close background check loopholes, ban  high-capacity magazines, ban bump stocks, ban military-grade firearms,  raise the minimum age to 21, require a skills and knowledge test, create  a registry, and require retesting once a year. #GunSafety
6644 2018-03-24 21:17:40 Yes, that's right. We can agree on that. So you don't care if we ban them then? You assume that it won't matter either way, so we can just get rid of bump stocks? That's great!
6645 2018-03-24 21:17:36 If those bump stocks he used were illegal and if those semis required a tax stamp and federal registration then he might've not wanted to jump through those hoops. Almost anyone can get a tax stamp and license for automatic weapons, few ever do because of the process.
6646 2018-03-24 21:17:19 Trump administration is banning bump stocks. You guys must be really crazy to make Trump look like the responsible one. 
6647 2018-03-24 21:16:30 I did read it. It doesn’t say Obama “legalized” bump stocks. It also said approved wasn’t technically correct either. It merely said the ATF couldn’t regulate them without new legislation or reinterpretation of the law.
6648 2018-03-24 21:16:23 The Obama administration did not legalize bump stocks Deceiver in Chief your deceipt knows no bounds. How’s Melania doing are you going to let her watch the Stormy Daniels interview
6649 2018-03-24 21:16:21 Why did you legalize bump stocks?

#Dummy
6650 2018-03-24 21:15:57 Hahahaha. Ok. Trump is already taking away the bump stocks and doing more than your buddy Obama did (he actually helped legalize bump stocks). This obviously wasn’t a priority for you all when he was in office. Weird timing.
6651 2018-03-24 21:15:56 Obama did not legalize bumpstocks. The ATF had no jurisdiction because there's no federal law on parts. Bump stocks were introduced falsely by manufacturers. They claimed it was to aid the disabled. Obama attempted to reintroduce the law that the GOP blocked in 1994. 3014th lie.
6652 2018-03-24 21:15:44 I thought you’d like them! Umbro website mate, but I got them a few months back so not sure what the stocks like. Can’t beat a pair of Speciali
6653 2018-03-24 21:15:31 Then the guns they were using. We would use 12gauge because I can hit more then one person and close range that’s what you want. AR-15!are no dangerous then a 12 G. People are crazy. And Obama let bump stocks legal and that just makes easier to more off faster.
6654 2018-03-24 21:15:17 It would now be in the same category. I assume that is also the reason people want bump stocks banned.
6655 2018-03-24 21:15:16 Considering bump stocks are legal and it's still a highly powerful assault-oriented weapon with a high potential rate of fire I'd say that's a moot point.
6656 2018-03-24 21:15:00 The American people need vote on Every tax dollar spent Every tax dollar of OUR money should be voted onHOWspent.  Reps&senate NOTdoin will of people! @realDonaldTrump & foolish stock ban attackSecond Amendment by a ThousandCuts! How plan2collect stocks fromNewCriminalsYouMake?
6657 2018-03-24 21:13:47 Call me crazy, but I don’t think these kids are going to be satisfied with a feckless ban on bump stocks. #MarchForOurLives
6658 2018-03-24 21:13:40 So lustig - das verbot gegen die "Bump Stocks" wird nichts bringen weil jeder Gürtel zu einem umfunktioniert werden kann. Und die USA wird auch nie ihre Waffen aufgeben - das liegt bereits in der Natur der Sache. Man kann nicht die ganze USA entwaffnen ohne Bürgerkrieg...
6659 2018-03-24 21:13:21 If they want to ban accessories that make guns “automatic” how come they aren’t praising Trump for banning bump stocks? These protestors have no idea what they are protesting, and neither do I based off some of the insane shit I’ve seen today
6660 2018-03-24 21:12:58 They already look like laughing stocks because of how PC they are as it is.
6661 2018-03-24 21:12:50 Foreign holders of US equities are already down 25%. US needs $1 trillion to balance books next 12 months or so, not a recipe to BTFD. Last 25% is all FX in stocks
6662 2018-03-24 21:12:19 What I am saying is who buys these stocks like $WFE when they are dead in the water at .001 and then suddenly Brewer is appointed and then so on. Then you learn who is who and the long standing connections behind the scenes. Any reasonable person can then put 2 and 2 together.
6663 2018-03-24 21:11:39 Bump stocks aren't the problem, either...
6664 2018-03-24 21:11:23 You can believe in right to bare arms and *also believe that their should be common sense gun laws. Taking away bump stocks, semi automatic weapons, and having better back ground checks is hardly saying people don’t have the right to defend themselves with a gun.
6665 2018-03-24 21:11:16 He actually signed an EO to ban bump stocks - passed into legality by BO.
6666 2018-03-24 21:11:08 According to Trump, the Obama admin. legalized bump stocks.
6667 2018-03-24 21:10:48 Joint stocks in NS sucks. Best of luck in your battle!
6668 2018-03-24 21:10:47 But we CAN make it harder for bad people to get guns. And we can do that by: 
Banning bump stocks. Repealing the laws that make it harder to register and track guns. Improving the background checks.
6669 2018-03-24 21:09:58 2018 is clearly a 5 year cycle completion phenomena ( very usual in INDIAN stock markets starting from 93-94) Current cycle started in 2012/13 primarily fuelled by low cost of capital globally. Stocks which gained the most will stabilise before taking call on next move.

1/2
6670 2018-03-24 21:09:52 Exactly!  And perhaps fears of “peak earnings”?  Traders need to understand that stocks like $MU often peak when they have a low P/E, and bottom with a high P/E.  Same goes with commodity stocks (and I can argue $MU is a different sort of commodity stock!).
6671 2018-03-24 21:08:59 how so? they don’t claim the shooter. they don’t think that he should’ve had the gun. they don’t think bump stocks should be sold. the NRA doesn’t support terrorist.
6672 2018-03-24 21:08:26 Agreed on conservatives.

But the policies being pushed on banning bump stocks, AR-15s, mental health background checks etc. are not intended to deal with everyday violence.

I also don't remember the same degree of moral outrage about this everyday violence either ...
6673 2018-03-24 21:08:16 Something the fuck has to matter again some fucking time. Senior Cabinet ministers being proved to have lied could be the test, because if that doesn’t matter, we’ve really fucking burnt the bridges & it’s time to lay in stocks of spaghetti hoops & build my own trebuchet
6674 2018-03-24 21:08:06 Also, it’s not decent and good. This is NRA-controlled Trump giving us the run around on bump stocks. If Trump really wanted to ban them, he’d sign an EO.
6675 2018-03-24 21:07:35 As the Senator said. Bump stocks. Raising the age. If you need a 30 round magazine for a handgun...you are already in an overwhelming situation and probably dead. The entertainment value in a 30 round magazine is not a Constitutional right.
6676 2018-03-24 21:07:10 I do think, however, that we can win a small amount of political capital at little cost by banning bump stocks at this time. They do worsen the carnage IF firing into a crowd. A ban would align with the purpose of the existing machine gun ban. The only argument against:
6677 2018-03-24 21:07:04 Ban bump stocks. Repeal the laws that make it harder to register and track guns. Improve the background checks. Repeating this every time you don't give me an answer.

I don't assume they will work. I've said "let's see where it goes from there."
6678 2018-03-24 21:07:02 Yet another one of your absurd lies. The Obama Administration did NOT legalize bump stocks. #TrumpLiesMatter
6679 2018-03-24 21:05:50 i listen to radiohead when my stocks fall wym
6680 2018-03-24 21:05:27 Im ok with background checks. Ban bump stocks and any modification to go full auto. But encourage training, safety, handling. Like to see more school security. Locked buildings. Guards. Not sure how i feel about ccw teachers. If trained? Ok.
6681 2018-03-24 21:05:09 How bout those bump stocks you legalized??  Remember what happened in Vegas?   Yea neither does anyone in the media.
6682 2018-03-24 21:04:47 Really? Cuz bump stocks are about to be regulated, a million people just marched in DC, he lost in PA in a very red district where he stumped for GOP candidate and someone slipped more Russian sanctions in spending bill he just signed w/out knowing. Thin Ice here and w Putin now
6683 2018-03-24 21:04:11 Obama ATF did not legalize bump stocks but instead determined that they are not a complete gun therefore were not to be regulated as guns. 

Huge difference from Trump’s statement. 

Using the words legalize or approved is twisting the true facts. 

Why does Trump LIE?
6684 2018-03-24 21:02:58 Ban bump stocks. Repeal the laws that make it harder to register and track guns. Improve the background checks.

That is all. That is all, and if you keep saying otherwise, I will just repeat my answer until it gets through to you.
6685 2018-03-24 21:02:57 Supporting legislation on background checks and ban bump-stocks are not Anti-gun. So, stop being misleading. If you want to bear arms openly, then why can't I have tactical nukes?
6686 2018-03-24 21:02:55 Unbelievably unaware statement to make about banning bump stocks.
6687 2018-03-24 21:02:51 President Trump said the DOJ was poised to take steps to ban bump stocks - & slammed his predecessor for making them legal - Obama legalized bump stocks, which obviously, was another bad move - The ATF will clarify the status of bump stocks
6688 2018-03-24 21:02:40 I cashed out my stocks in Starbucks and Walgreens and the post office ripped my check in half. WHY IS MY LIFE LIKE THIS.
6689 2018-03-24 21:02:40 Trump tried to look like he cared bout gun control when he banned bump stocks yesterday, then late at night he showed his true colors and banned anyone who is transgender from the military--what a horrible (person) creton.
6690 2018-03-24 21:02:39 Dude, do you need semi-automatic rifles and bump stocks for protection? No. A simple handgun that can hold 8-10 bullets IS PLENTY for self defense. A rifle for hunting is totally fine.
6691 2018-03-24 21:02:39 When have bump stocks ever been used other than Vegas? They make guns incredibly inaccurate, difficult to fire and prone to jamming. Trump has also moved to ban bump stocks. Nobody is making a case for bump stocks.
6692 2018-03-24 21:02:33 I am pro hunter, Bow or rifle...my husband, father, grandfathers, colleagues all served - and are pro gun safety. Don’t need bump stocks to hunt & nothing wrong with background checks
6693 2018-03-24 21:02:14 Ironically you're probably someone who wants to take the rights away from other people like LGTB or women. 

There is no current law Banning bump stocks, semi-automatic weapons, background checks on every individual in order to purchase a weapon. Research is important!
6694 2018-03-24 21:01:25 Says the man who approved the sale of bump stocks.
6695 2018-03-24 21:01:13 Sitting here imagining the conversation when Obama turned to Biden and said "you know Joe, America needs more bump stocks". Joe just smiled and nodded in agreement
6696 2018-03-24 21:00:25 Bump stocks don’t increase rate of fire? High capacity mags don’t increase capacity to kill?
6697 2018-03-24 21:00:00 You don't need a bump stock to wipe out a classroom of kids. You just need one full 30-round magazine. A ban on bump stocks is like applying a band aid to a traumatic amputation.
6698 2018-03-24 20:59:45 Um...no. It doesn't even remotely do that. Research a little about how bump stocks work and get back to me.
6699 2018-03-24 20:59:26 This requires MORE much more than Bump stocks which Is a no brainer ... ALL ASSAULT WEAPONS! Period ! BETTER BACK GROUND CHECKS ! A MUST !
6700 2018-03-24 20:59:14 My standard mantra when market looks cranky & agitated: have a plan. If u are a trader or investor, what would you do if your stocks went up, down or even sideways? What are your stops & how much is at risk? Whatever the time frame, have a plan ready for next week. $SPY $QQQ $IWM
6701 2018-03-24 20:58:49 Obama's Bump stocks you mean.
6702 2018-03-24 20:58:05 @CambJunction great doorstaff tonight - although the policy was to remove pre-filled water bottles from bags, my teen was given a free replacement from your own stocks when I let them know she is prone to fainting. Good call!
6703 2018-03-24 20:57:59 Hi John, unfortunately the closest store that stocks fresh basil is the Springfield store. I can see that the Chelmsford store has fresh coriander. Did you ask any of our colleagues in store whether this item was in stock or not? Sal
6704 2018-03-24 20:57:56 Let the @NRA stand with us for comprehensive universal background checks,raising the minimum buying age,closing loopholes that should never be there in the first place,a ban on bump stocks and assault firearms (why the need at all) and more.
6705 2018-03-24 20:57:34 I never brought up bump stocks. You said you were against civilians buying military grade weapons. I said they can’t. I was right, you were wrong. I’m sorry I called you a dipshit.
6706 2018-03-24 20:56:40 It's just wild how after Sandy hook or the Aurora shootings nothing was done under Obama. Now trumps here banning bump stocks and raising the age to get weapons and this is all on him. And he will forever get blamed for all these shootings just because everyone hates him lol
6707 2018-03-24 20:56:18 It means no assault rifles and bump stocks, it means that not everyone gets a gun. It means that when I go to teach your children I have a right to be safe.
6708 2018-03-24 20:56:16 Bump stocks are being made illegal, so we're fixing what made Vegas happen.

Nearly every gun can do what happened in shootings with AR-15s. Semiautomatic pistols can do the same, and shotguns are even more dangerous.
6709 2018-03-24 20:56:00 Mais sais-tu s'ils ont donné leurs stocks à un autre organisme? La SIRLA ou "le livre de l'aveugle" par exemple?
6710 2018-03-24 20:55:55 gun ban, nobody is really looking to ban guns, they want reform, like back ground checks, removing weapons of war from the streets, no bump stocks. You need to listen better and get all those NRA $ signs out of your head. Try and win an election without those dollars for support.
6711 2018-03-24 20:55:44 Yeah bump stocks aren't good.
6712 2018-03-24 20:55:42 Do you play often? Trying to find some ppl to play with at night around 11pm pst
6713 2018-03-24 20:55:42 These plans do not address universal background checks, bump stocks, access to weapons of war like AR-15s or large capacity ammunition. You also have voted to eliminate health care services, which pays for mental healthcare assessments and services. #TellTheTruth
6714 2018-03-24 20:55:32 It’s naive to think you could take all guns away. It’s just not realistic. I do believe there is a common ground but both sides aren’t willing to find it. Why haven’t they acknowledged the step forward that has been made this week banning bump stocks & altering guns?
6715 2018-03-24 20:55:30 But don’t you find their significant underperformance quite troubling while other chip stocks had been going to the moon?
6716 2018-03-24 20:55:18 Untrue. If he does something right by the people/for the people I'll say it. Bump stocks is one of those. They're so few & far between. Almost nonexistent. What made me dislike him isn't the party...but the 1950's regressive views & the implementation of them.
6717 2018-03-24 20:55:06 There are already millions of bump stocks in the hands of citizens.  They can be sold to others on the black market.  Same for 30 or more rounds in a clip.

We cannot stop what has already been put into circulation.  Think about that.
6718 2018-03-24 20:54:55 What I want to know is coach wearing mismatched stocks ??
6719 2018-03-24 20:54:40 Y a pas de dates sur les tickets de métro. Raison pour laquelle a chaque annonce d'augmentation on fait des stocks 
6720 2018-03-24 20:54:30 @realDonaldTrump I hope you're paying attention. These marches are not being done in indiscriminately, they are well organized! It's time for logical gun reform. It's time to make semi-automatic weapons and bump stocks illegal! They can either vote now or very soon from now!
6721 2018-03-24 20:54:17 TRUMP BANNED BUMP STOCKS 
6722 2018-03-24 20:54:06 I meant EFT. Electronic Funds Transfer. I usually use EFT to transfer from bank to Fidelity account. The thing is fidelity will not let you trade OTC stocks tell the money has completely cleared. So to get the money quicker like same day usually an hour or less I’ve done wire
6723 2018-03-24 20:54:02 Wasn’t he he one that first approved bump stocks? 
6724 2018-03-24 20:53:55 Pretty sure it's about assault style weapons, bump stocks and uniformed national gun laws. Other than a few celebs I haven't heard one person say they want to ban all guns.
6725 2018-03-24 20:53:55 Great, so would he be opposed to mandatory background checks for every gun sale, no matter where, registration (like, say, a car?) and an end to 30-round magazines, bump stocks, and gattling attachments? How does that affect his range experience?
6726 2018-03-24 20:53:12 Correct, but bump stocks increase the rate of acutation you can achieve that would otherwise be physically impossible just pulling your finger. I'm pro 2A, but it's definitely a work around.
6727 2018-03-24 20:53:08 Trump proposed raising age limit to buy certain guns, eliminating bump stocks, strengthening federal background checks, & he applauded ''the many courageous young Americans exercising their 1st amendment rights today''. 
David Hogg hung up on the President.
6728 2018-03-24 20:53:01 Stocks can be cut in half easily ...look at the popular Follows on Twitter....all saying it ain’t over like @RyanDetrick @ukarlewitz @CNBC every house has min 2800 and up to @dwyerstrategy 3100 SPX Targets....impossible
6729 2018-03-24 20:52:38 This ban on bump stocks is really going to do the trick, right?
6730 2018-03-24 20:51:16 You start by taking away the assault weapons (again) and then you place realistic ‘regulations’ on other guns.  Remember, the 2A says “well-regulated”.  Raise the age limit to buy, do away with bumb stocks, increase background checks, license owners...
6731 2018-03-24 20:51:11 #dotherightthingmark Well Mr. Facebook feeling shit for not stepping in 18 months ago, saving the planet from certain financial hell, saving Billions of $ on your stocks, the flights & farts of Prezzi' Trump or the fact that that money alone could have saved millions of lives.
6732 2018-03-24 20:50:00 Spellcheck changed gun stocks to gun stops. Spellcheck, just let me type and leave me alone. #NotOneMore
6733 2018-03-24 20:49:45 WHAT have they gotten done? There was a run on gun buying. Students who are not proficient in the 3Rs are marching and spouting indoctrinated talking points. Parkland students now have to have clear backpacks and IDs. Bump stocks may be gone but they were just legalized by Obama.
6734 2018-03-24 20:49:38 What’s the point of banning bump stocks when anyone with half a brain knows how to turn a semi into a full without using one. Ban guns, full stop!
6735 2018-03-24 20:49:03 That's just too simple and naive. It's too obvious. If they see a bunch of new money inflows to these stocks they will take up short positions and engineer a way to bring them down.
6736 2018-03-24 20:48:28 Question for the value+trend/rules-based momentum pros (apologies if that’s the wrong label)...

On balance, what’s the most widely followed trend-line or momentum rule/s applied in stocks today?

@MebFaber @alphaarchitect @danielcrosby @bill_baruch any thoughts would be apprctd.
6737 2018-03-24 20:48:15 Stricter gun laws. Not more cops. 

Strengthen background checks
Ban high capacity magazines
Ban bump stocks
Restrict “Assault Weapons”
Promote SMART guns
”Safe Storage” laws

If you do your research it’s won’t seem as ‘vague’. 

#MarchForOurLives  
6738 2018-03-24 20:47:19 Hitler definitely cared about kids, and he got rid of guns. Sounds like a dream doesn't it? 
The 1st amendment is protected by the 2nd amendment and military weapons are already outlawed, with exception of bump stocks, which many GOP politicians are even against.
6739 2018-03-24 20:47:08 ETF's? Oh you mean pussy stocks for wussies not man enough for real stock analysis. :P
6740 2018-03-24 20:47:00 Compromise for Rubio on this issue means:  You kids need to agree with the very important points made by the NRA as the GOP makes a handwaving gesture in favor of banning bump stocks.  The end.
6741 2018-03-24 20:46:58 What does moving closer mean? Trumpie either wants gun control reform or not. Banning bump stocks is not enough. Ban military assault weapons, ban high capacity magazines, ban gun shows and institute universal background checks. Finally, revoke the NRA's charter as a lobbyist.
6742 2018-03-24 20:46:54 They'll take out the tyrant they elected with long guns. Killing tanks and Fighter jets with their bump stocks. Said no Intelligent person ever. Oh and the A.C. carriers will be easily defeated by your  pistol. Smdh at the stupid who claim us best military but will stop.them.
6743 2018-03-24 20:46:50 I usually don't find the spreads to be that bad, only in times of a volitile move and then $SPY is likley widens too. With stocks like $GOOGL $AMZN $PCLN you are going tp get wide spreads too because of the price.
6744 2018-03-24 20:46:39 Can’t you read I said Las Vegas used bump stocks The weapons were modified! Even NRA is ok with banning bump stocks! Fully automatic weapons that can fire the way you described are already banned!! Semi automatic such as AR15 can’t fire that way!
6745 2018-03-24 20:46:33 Excellent! I hope this current movement answers the question of "When?" I have to say, I'm not hopeful. Meaningful gun legislation isn't banning bump stocks or raising the age. It's ending gun shows & extending wait periods. But we'll see.
6746 2018-03-24 20:46:20 They didn't "legalize" bump stocks you idiot. Legalizing something requires the enactment of a law. No law was ever passed that specifically stated bump stocks were legal. How did you get elected with no knowledge of how things work?
6747 2018-03-24 20:45:35 Ok but you don't need bump stocks & an AK or AR for that. Please keep up on your range training and store your firearm/ammo safely. Asking for responsible ownership & acquisition.
6748 2018-03-24 20:45:30 Neither do bump stocks
6749 2018-03-24 20:45:08 The US military does not use AR 15s with bump stocks and civilians cannot buy military grade weapons.  Why won’t you admit that civilians cannot legally but military grade weapons. You are misleading your supporters.
6750 2018-03-24 20:45:05 @TheJusticeDept @JeffSessions_ @POTUS I have two bump fire stocks. How are you going to take them from me?
6751 2018-03-24 20:44:47 I said better background checks, and the repeal of laws that stop gun registries and gun tracking from working, and the banning of bump stocks. That's 4 different answers. Stop telling me what I'm saying, I know what I'm saying.
And again you're taking a saying literally. Christ.
6752 2018-03-24 20:44:47 2d amendment has room for commonsense safety measures, like background checks, ban of bump stocks and, yes, ban of assault rifles. Don’t be simplistic.
6753 2018-03-24 20:44:31 I bet you gun stocks go up after this March
6754 2018-03-24 20:43:35 Obama controlled congress for 6 of his 8 years.  I believe bump stocks were legalized under Obama.
6755 2018-03-24 20:43:24 Founding fathers didn't put bump stocks and automatic weapons in the constitution. 
#stopbeinganNRApuppet.
6756 2018-03-24 20:43:23 Mandatory regular re-licensing, psychiatric evaluation, ending gun-Show loop holes, harder-to-pass testing, gun-safety inspections, federally banning bump stocks, large-capacity magazines & silencers... those are just starts.
6757 2018-03-24 20:42:52 I don’t believe anyone is advocating taking away guns in general —not hunting rifles or shotguns, or handguns. What is being sought—commonsense limitations denying access to people who are dangerous, and banning bump stocks and assault rifles—and that is consistent with 2d amend.
6758 2018-03-24 20:42:38 I really want to get into trading stocks again 
6759 2018-03-24 20:42:20 The PE ratio has doubled since 2011 and is considered Ultra High in and of itself stocks historically extremely expensive...there is 0 reason to be long of stocks Zweigism
6760 2018-03-24 20:41:45 On Gun reform yes.  As soon as Trump talked with the NRA he backed down. BTW how are your stocks doing?
6761 2018-03-24 20:41:36 Volatility is great! Best prices on good stocks! Plus, I trade options, too, so I make money either way ;)
6762 2018-03-24 20:41:31 Trump is really fucking up the stock market. All my stocks are in red
6763 2018-03-24 20:40:53 Some stocks look sexy. Others do not. Although I liked what I saw in $LG at the time of investment, right now it has the sex appeal of a scholbus fire! #potstocks
6764 2018-03-24 20:40:48 Actual universal background checks. Closure of gun show loophole. Ban on bump stocks which make weapons much more lethal (in a short amount of time). Ban on public's ability to own weapons meant for military use.
6765 2018-03-24 20:39:37 During the festival season, there is the looming threat of yakisoba sets reaching low stocks.
6766 2018-03-24 20:39:12 Vermont just did this! 
banned bump stocks
expanded federal background checks to all private sales
banned high-capacity magazines
raised age to purchase a gun from 18-21
 overall vote on the bill, 85-59
6767 2018-03-24 20:38:54 90% of Americans support gun restrictions & bans of bump stocks. Most also support bans of military style assault weapons. You are so warped by the NRA you cannot even see through the $ forest for the trees of life.
6768 2018-03-24 20:38:50 Mr. President BAN Bump Stocks!  The country cannot go thru another mass shooting!
6769 2018-03-24 20:38:16 bump stocks shouldn’t be considered as something for self defense. you don’t need to fire so many shots at such a short amount of time. a handgun can do just fine in that case. giving people access to bump stocks is what creates the problems we’re trying to prevent in the future
6770 2018-03-24 20:37:43 Trump has already Banned bump stocks and any other modification making guns able to fire fully automatic, and Automatic guns are not available to the general public. The media was silent when an SRO charged in and saved all the students in a recent shooting, what else can we do?
6771 2018-03-24 20:37:42 President Obama TRIED to ban bump stocks--could only regulate them because Congress refused! Semi-automatic rifles should be banned from sale to private citizens, too. They are MILITARY rifles!!! Col. Carlson (Ret.) talked on C-Span today about using AK-47s in Vietnam in the 70s!
6772 2018-03-24 20:37:30 Just got into stocks. Literally! Still learning.
6773 2018-03-24 20:37:22 The point is that I am outraged, and I'm not alone. The point is that we could have gun control, but every time we bring it up we're insulted and attacked. The point is we NEED rules and regulations. Ban the bump stocks, repeal those laws that make it harder to track guns.
6774 2018-03-24 20:36:45 Back at you....if banning bump stocks and magazines means (if there is another shooting) that less ppl would be killed because some psyco did not have access to them...I'm all for it...nobody can stop some ppl from flipping out...that's life...limit it!
6775 2018-03-24 20:36:41 Boy oh boy-here’s a list of what people are marching for: background checks on each and every gun sale, banning bump stocks and other accessories which make a killing machine even more lethal, improve mental health access, ban assault rifles (if there is such a thing). Clear now?
6776 2018-03-24 20:36:31 Tuesday - he repeals gay marriages
Wednesday - declared war on N Korea
Thursday - changes his mind on bump stocks
Friday - another firing and lawyer change
6777 2018-03-24 20:36:22 Wish his passion for banning bump stocks was as high as my passion for banning this a-hole from the WH and from America!
6778 2018-03-24 20:35:51 Trump's gesture to ban bump stocks is as weak and ineffective as everything else about him. I've seen several comments from gun nuts saying 'lmao, you think I need a bump stock to rock and roll?" AR-15's aren't exactly hard to mod, which is why they're so popular with DIY'ers.
6779 2018-03-24 20:35:47 Bump stocks lol. I'll give someone 30 rounds with a bump stock and 5 without and I like my chances better with a guy with 5.
6780 2018-03-24 20:35:41 Today we march. Monday we divest any and all mutual funds that have any gun manufacturer stocks in them. #enoughisenough
6781 2018-03-24 20:35:40 I agree but it troubles me that he would exploit an obvious false flag shooting to implement a ban on bump stocks. We cannot be blind about such things. How can Trump not know what the Parkland shooting really was about? Do we believe he is naive or corrupt?
6782 2018-03-24 20:34:01 Really? You can make your own 30 round magazines? Bump stocks?
6783 2018-03-24 20:33:55 "Divest in gun stocks!" Columbine survivor implores. #MarchForOurLives SF
6784 2018-03-24 20:33:53 Columbine survivor talking about divesting yourself from gun stocks hiding in your retirement accounts: "nothing is more patriotic than using the free market to make change happen...put your money where your mouth is!" #MarchForOurLives
6785 2018-03-24 20:33:25 Bump stocks should be illegal
6786 2018-03-24 20:33:02 And Moses said unto Pharoah, “Let my bump stocks go!”
6787 2018-03-24 20:32:58 “There is a right side of history, and you have the power to divest”

On the imprtance of making sure your retirement/mutual find doesn’t own gun company stocks.

#MarchForOurLivesSF
6788 2018-03-24 20:32:45 Ban bump stocks, fine.
Age to purchase to 21. If you want this you have to move the voting age and military age to 21. No
Universal background checks, fine.
Ban assault weapons?  What is an assault weapon?  If you say semi auto, no I don't agree.
What capacity?
Restraining on?
6789 2018-03-24 20:30:56 Sigh. There is no thing as a "gun show loophole" all gun shows must do background checks. It is not required, because it can't be enforced, in private sales. They want to ban "AR'' rifles which are not assault rifles. Trump already said he would ban bump stocks.
6790 2018-03-24 20:30:41 Actually his supporters would be outraged if Obama banned bump stocks. So his way of getting them to support the move is by claiming Obama legalized them. Nothing gains MAGA support like saying it’s the opposite of something the black president did
6791 2018-03-24 20:30:11 I do believe in the 2A, however I don’t believe in Open Carry, civilians having military grade weapons, gun shows having loopholes, not having extensive background/mental health checks, bump stocks, GatCranks, allowing domestic abusers/felons to possess a firearm ever, etc.
6792 2018-03-24 20:29:52 Should I make more videos on long term investing and buying stocks? Or just stick to options?
6793 2018-03-24 20:29:00 The kind of gun control I can get behind.
Back to resource stocks.
6794 2018-03-24 20:28:56 Brotha u gotta quickly get rid of those shitty leaf stocks on your headers. Aside from that this heada dope
6795 2018-03-24 20:28:41 I don't buy stocks based on polls. I care about pipeline and OMER wins.
6796 2018-03-24 20:28:39 Great that you're finally getting rid of ONE thing: bump stocks. Lying about  Obama is just the same old sh*t though. Time to get rid of the big guns and start some sensible gun control. Mueller is coming. . .so is the Big Blue Wave,
6797 2018-03-24 20:28:36 No, Marco. Sometimes there is no common ground. Sometimes one side is right and one side is wrong. Civilians don't need assault weapons. Civilians don't need bump stocks. Civilians don't need high-capacity magazines. Universal background checks are non-negotiable. #NeverAgain
6798 2018-03-24 20:28:28 Trump proposes various fixes like the system for reporting background checks and a ban on bump stocks. Obama cried but enacted no legislation that could have prevented any mass shooting. How is your criticism fair?
6799 2018-03-24 20:28:27 You're not seperating the 'fantasy' from 'reality.' I've already said that I know that is never going to happen for at least a few hundred years. Can we please just have the rules and regulations? Background checks, banned bump-stocks, please?
6800 2018-03-24 20:28:22 I hate spellcheck I meant gun stocks, not stops
6801 2018-03-24 20:27:52 background checks fine. that's NOT what your people are demanding!!! they're demanding banning ar-15s bump stocks etc.
6802 2018-03-24 20:27:49 My two-cents on Bump Stocks  Bumpstocks are a red herring, they cause inaccurate fire and are considered a joke among marksmen.  Outlawing them will just create a black market for them. #Pathetic
6803 2018-03-24 20:27:09 Liar, liar, pants on fire.
You moron, Obama didn't legalize bump stocks. He issued EOs creating stricter controls (all of which YOU have rolled back), but could not legally restrict (non mechanical) bump stocks without new laws. Congress refused.
6804 2018-03-24 20:27:07 @AmericaNewsroom Kids are saying that some gun control measures are necessary. Ban the AR-15, bump stocks & more background checks. Congress needs to take note of this movement. They don't advocate total repeal of the 2nd Amendment.
6805 2018-03-24 20:26:49 Let me b perfectly clear AGAIN... Im a firm believer in the 2nd Amendment. That said, i know unequivocally, our forefathers saying “ Right to Bear Arms” wasnt a rt wo limits. Bump Stocks, Assault Weapns, Tracer Bullets, Multi Round Magazines... They r rolling ovr in their graves!
6806 2018-03-24 20:26:13 Ban gun stocks! Disarm the #NRA! #March4OurLives #NRABoycott
6807 2018-03-24 20:26:09 I have a lot of friends who are good people with gun hobbies. But there’s no way you can convince me that empathy isn’t more important than hobby. Trigger actuators should be illegal. Bump stocks should be illegal. You’ll never need more than 10 rounds in a mag to defend yourself
6808 2018-03-24 20:26:01 First of all, you can pull the trigger on an AR-15 a lot faster than what is shown in this video. You can empty a 30-round magazine in about 12 seconds. Bump stocks allows a faster rate of fire, but also a lot less accuracy.
6809 2018-03-24 20:25:58 What weapons are you talking about? Ar-15’s are not automatic and only become automatic with bump stocks. Trump found this out and immediately went forward to make them illegal. All other assault rifles have been illegal since the 80’s and that hasn’t changed.
6810 2018-03-24 20:25:25 Young people have no idea that they are the ones loosing rights.  Tens of millions of gun owners in this country are law abiding citizens and you sir are the one that allowed AR15 back into sales after study showed no difference also bump stocks.  Hypocrite.
6811 2018-03-24 20:25:25 One doubt, none of these stocks are Nifty50, how does it relate to levels of Nifty50 to buy these stocks? I am new here, would be great if you are able to guide please
6812 2018-03-24 20:25:07 Bump Stocks.
If you dont do your homework how do you expect anyone to Believe You.
6813 2018-03-24 20:24:36 $n $nxttf #namastemd #telemedicine is the future of #cannabis. @Namaste_Tech will dominate the technology and #ecommerce aspect of the cannabis industry worldwide. In a few years #Namaste Technologies Inc will be a global name just like #Amazon. Looking forward to 2018.
6814 2018-03-24 20:24:36 I disagree with this from first hand knowledge. I worked in a hospital that had metal detectors. I could get a Glock through them with no problem. Again, no one is talking about taking away semi-automatics. It's the military style weapons, bump stocks, and extended magazines
6815 2018-03-24 20:24:24 Gun show loop hole is not even real.  Bump stocks YES ban those.  Magazine NOPE not touching that.  Please don't speak for Majority of gun owners, you haven't talked to 100 million people.
6816 2018-03-24 20:24:11 I can see the republican’t 2018 campaign mottos now…

“I will not rest until all bump stocks are destroyed! And then I WILL REST!”
6817 2018-03-24 20:24:08 They're not demanding your guns -- they're demanding action. Actions like background checks for gun shows and online sales; outlawing bump stocks, silencers, and drum mags; restrictions on gun sales to felons and the mentally unstable.
6818 2018-03-24 20:23:37 Lol even if ARs and bump stocks are illegal im still gonna own an AR with a bump stock XD silencers are illegal and i still got one XD
6819 2018-03-24 20:23:32 really Kyle???     how long ago was Las Vegas?     are bump stocks still legal????  not even ONE small step taken!
6820 2018-03-24 20:23:19 Just to put it in context

when you trade stocks, invest in machines,educate people

you are actually paying for potentials
6821 2018-03-24 20:23:15 What common sense regulations?  Assaults have been banned.  Bump stocks are going to be banned.  What else is left.  Can the FBI and police do their job?  Is holding them accountable a common sense thing to do?
6822 2018-03-24 20:22:53 No bump stocks no semi automatic gun's with more than 100 rounds of ammo sounds fair enough
6823 2018-03-24 20:22:25 Only Congress can make bump stocks illegal because they are not against the law. They do not alter the firing mechanism of a semi-auto rifle to make it full auto.
6824 2018-03-24 20:21:58 No one pays for Potential?

Then why do people trade stocks?

Why do you send people to school?

The foundation of business and Investment is drawn to valuation

Valuation = capacity & potentials
6825 2018-03-24 20:21:24 "Banning bump stocks doesn't infringe on the Second Amendment because bump stocks aren't guns!"

Show me where the Second Amendment says "guns."
6826 2018-03-24 20:20:27 My guess...bump fire stocks not guns banned till age 21 and he will call this gun control...geezzz
6827 2018-03-24 20:20:24 Yeah, I probably didn’t phrase that right. In other words... if you’ve been waiting to put money to work, now is a decent time(from a historical perspective) to pick through the rubble because there’s a decent chance some high quality stocks were sold off harder than they deserve
6828 2018-03-24 20:20:18 Having one of your minions issue a "rule" doesn't cut it. You can easily renege and change your mind next week. We need LAWs to restrict Bump Stocks, Military weapons, large magazines, sales to anyone under 21. 
Sorry, your word isn't any good.
#NRA #NeverAgain #TrumpLies #resist
6829 2018-03-24 20:20:10 Très triste d'avoir étais confronté a une rupture de stocks de soucoupes @CarrefourFrance
6830 2018-03-24 20:20:06 just a photo opt, how about a shout out to the POTUS for announcing a ban on bump stocks as per the DOJ. President Trump has embraced the march and the concern of the students
6831 2018-03-24 20:19:34 So stocks i had split however went up in price.. not sure if this is good or bad
6832 2018-03-24 20:18:54 I watched this BS and was sickened.  Like Obama had a choice about bump stocks.  LIes and misrepresentations is the foundation of state run TV aka @FoxNews
6833 2018-03-24 20:18:00 EXACTLY. and I call absolute bull. sure you'll ban ar-15s and bump stocks and then when the next mass shooting happens  (because it will) you'll keep taking and taking.  the ultimate goal is to eliminate guns completely and you're all lying to yourselves if you think otherwise
6834 2018-03-24 20:16:52 Today was about sensible gun regs. Nothing extreme and u know it! So, background checks, no civilian assault rifles (military/police only), 21 to purchase, no gun stocks, limited size clips, etc. Please reply & I'll retweet your answer. (Doubt you will). Everyone will know.
6835 2018-03-24 20:16:49 Bump stocks are for cowards. They only exist to kill as many people as possible. THEY. ARE. UNNECESSARY. AND DANGEROUS
6836 2018-03-24 20:16:27 How can you call yourself a Greenie when you vote to shrink marine national parks to allow huge trawler processing ships to strip our fish stocks and damage our reefs
6837 2018-03-24 20:16:07 We buy our cornmeal from Tesco but we have a huge store near us that stocks a lot of stuff most supermarkets don't. If you're having trouble finding it maybe buy online?
6838 2018-03-24 20:16:02 More bull...bump stocks not considered a ‘gun’ so no making it illegal...Nice try tho mr ‘alternative facts’
6839 2018-03-24 20:15:59 I wish I could have been there marching today. Instead, I sit here cheering you on! We need comprehensive gun law reform. We need to ban AR-15s and bump stocks. And we need our elected officials to acknowledge that our children’s lives mean more than their guns #NeverAgain
6840 2018-03-24 20:15:57 I did.  It said that his hands were tied and he couldn't undo it.  Don't look at NRA check "politifact" when you google "did Obama legalize bump stocks"
6841 2018-03-24 20:15:40 Logiquement oui, mais après tous les Primark n’ont pas les mêmes stocks en même temps !  Aucune idée, après tu peux suivre ça sur les groupes fb par exemple :)
6842 2018-03-24 20:14:59 No disrespect, but judging by your tweets it seemed you were having an out of this world month in jan, so a bit puzzled you are only up 3% QTD? were feb and march that bad to you? is that performance for all your trades (stocks, options and futures) ? thanks for the info
6843 2018-03-24 20:14:58 Those of us that use safely, purchased legally and have a background in law enforcement never committed a crime are you going to make us criminals or pay for our stocks?? Sad when deep state set it up
6844 2018-03-24 20:14:57 Have you seen their stocks falling??
6845 2018-03-24 20:14:32 FUCKKKKKK, Amazon stocks Sasameki Koto too!?!?!?!
6846 2018-03-24 20:14:20 @barackobama are you going to tell them that you legalized Bump stocks?
6847 2018-03-24 20:14:15 I believe bump stocks should be banned, the minimum age should be raised, and Congress people not already asking should get off their fucking asses and do something about gun control.@AmodeiForNevada
6848 2018-03-24 20:14:13 In 1934 America banned machine guns, thank you trump for banning bump stocks! Common sense solution!! I love my ar15
6849 2018-03-24 20:13:57 I have AR 15s, bump stocks, etc. Good luck taking them.
6850 2018-03-24 20:12:31 The common ground:  We don’t want to take all your guns...  Just assault weapons & bump stocks...   And gun owners should have control over their weapons at all times...  Kids shouldn’t accidentally get ahold of grownups’ guns...  REALLY SIMPLE COMMON SENSE!!!
6851 2018-03-24 20:12:29 Okay bright light Obama Administration DID NOT legalize Bump Stocks. They sent a letter CLARIFYING THE LAW. THE EXISTING LAW!!!
6852 2018-03-24 20:11:47 Or Stocks Investment

6854 2018-03-24 20:11:39 @marcorubio I don’t think this was a march to ban all guns. I heard about restrictions and regulation. I heard about banning bump stocks. I did heard about banning assault weapons. I’m not sure you were listening. By the way, they will vote someday. I’d listen.
6855 2018-03-24 20:11:12 I have just spent FOREVER looking for a cheaper platform to transfer my children's stocks & shares Child Trust Funds (yes still CTFs not #JISAs), only to discover...

...there isn't one.
Cheapest to leave them exactly where they are.
AAAAAAAARGH (Head + desk)
6856 2018-03-24 20:10:28 Already were lol. Florida, Ominbus Bill Bump stocks.  So out of touch.
6857 2018-03-24 20:10:15 Rappelle moi dfaire des stocks de clopes avant d’aller en Suisse
6858 2018-03-24 20:10:10 So you guys are marching against a organization that advocates gun safety, common sense regulations, & responsible gun ownership. How smart. Are U aware @NRA called for regulation on bump stocks. Fell upon Obama Admin deaf ears. @POTUS recently called for ban of bump stock.
6859 2018-03-24 20:10:02 Then please defend the party's silence on the question of bump stocks
6860 2018-03-24 20:08:36 The Obama Administration legalized bump stocks?  Really?...REALLY?  Do you REALLY expect ANYONE to believe the ridiculous things that you routinely claim? Mr. Trump, #1:  YOU ARE A NOTORIOUS CONGENITAL, PATHALOGICAL, LIAR.  #2:  You campaigned as the MOST PRO-NRA Candidate, ever!
6861 2018-03-24 20:08:30 I’m struggling to like you, but if you would actually listen to what the people want (banning bump stocks and assault rifles for civilians), I would have to respect you for that. please listen
6862 2018-03-24 20:08:21 Yes and majority are against weapons that unload massive quantity of bullets. My shotgun along with my Beretta Pico and my wife’s S&W revolver are just fine..... no need for 30 round clips and bump stocks!
6863 2018-03-24 20:07:47 @Ninja do you play fortnite on iOS? If you need an invite i got one. Hit me up
6864 2018-03-24 20:07:31 Dicks has had the first big drop in sells and stocks from this
6865 2018-03-24 20:07:27 #GOP Are paying attention?#MarchForOurLives Our kids are, they're turning 18 and they realize that GOP has no solution to benefit "We the Rabble"* only the propertied, the 1%ers. #nov2018 No more weapons of war in civilian hands, oversize mags, bump stocks. Off your asses GOP.
6866 2018-03-24 20:07:26 And most mass shootings are performed by people who are not prohibited possessors, which is the reason for making it more difficult for them to inflict mass damage. Hence the proposals for things like limited magazine capacities and no bump stocks
6867 2018-03-24 20:07:22 You’ve got 6 total followers, congratulations.
6868 2018-03-24 20:06:44 @davidhogg111  My small state just did this this week!  

•banned bump stocks
•expanded federal background checks to all private sales •banned high-capacity magazines
•raised age to purchase a gun from 18-21
6869 2018-03-24 20:06:26 It is bump stocks and they were never illegal!
6870 2018-03-24 20:06:23 Please explain the purpose for, and defend the legality of bump stocks, which convert a civilian AR15 into an effectively full-auto weapon.
6871 2018-03-24 20:06:19 LOL educate yourself most gun owners could care less about bump stocks. Your arguments are pathetic and just show how uninformed you are. The NRA membership has skyrocketed, do some research
6872 2018-03-24 20:05:38 One of the most exciting stocks in bio
6873 2018-03-24 20:05:20 They’re saying the Trump administration has gotten some measures past, but they really haven’t much. They want guards at the schools.  They’re so worried about the NRA, that they’re scared to ban assault weapons and bump stocks.  GOP isn’t for the PEOPLE!   #MarchForOurLives
6874 2018-03-24 20:05:08 As usual, you lie. Obama didn’t legalize bump stocks. Please resign. Please.
6875 2018-03-24 20:05:05 You mean the same ones who say it’s different this time. Great buying opportunity. Stocks are on sale??
6876 2018-03-24 20:04:51 Super Smell Of Stocks ..
6877 2018-03-24 20:04:24 yes! so not a hypocrite ... just undecided and fighting with joint stocks to get a name approved. 
6878 2018-03-24 20:04:14 Was this the first free loot for fortnite?
6879 2018-03-24 20:03:46 “NOTHING” in what way? 
In the Clinton/Bush/Obama way? He just banned bump stocks that B.O. allowed.

But you’re right, he’s done NOTHING to deserve this treatment.
6880 2018-03-24 20:03:35 Liar. The Obama administration did NOT legalize bump stocks. The Justice Dept ruled there was no legal basis to ban them and that it would be up to Congress to change the law. Why do you keep lying to the American public?
6881 2018-03-24 20:03:33 MORNING, He angered his base when by banning the gun bump stocks.
NIGHT, he wanted to make it up.
6882 2018-03-24 20:03:27 Get ready for the tsunami gun control program coming your way: No more high cap mags, no more bump stocks, no more "gun show loopholes," and your going to have to register that fucking kindergarten killer AR-15. TFB!
6883 2018-03-24 20:03:25 NO THEY DIDN'T.  You are such a liar.  They tried to ban them by regulation and determined that it would not support a court challenge.  YOU should be supporting legislation to ban bump stocks, not a Presidential decree.
6884 2018-03-24 20:03:25 But finance , stocks, ETF’s, bonds and commodities is more of an passion.
6885 2018-03-24 20:03:08 Sweet! Just got some free loot for #Fortnite from linking my #twitch #prime with my account thanks @Twitch and @TwitchPrime
6886 2018-03-24 20:03:06 Stocks have risen& unemployment has gone down since Trump took office, Numbers.
6887 2018-03-24 20:02:32 That’s weird, because there’s already a bill in Congress about banning bump stocks... not to mention millions of people around the world marching in support. seems like progress to me.
6888 2018-03-24 20:02:26 Trump just signed a uniparty spending bill and is going to ban bump stocks. He’s actively trying to be a one term POTUS.
6889 2018-03-24 20:02:16 Obama did NOTHING to help gun control when he was president but Trump will and has already asked to raise the age to 21, ban bump stocks and add mental health checks. Obama's tweet is meaningless
6890 2018-03-24 20:00:41 Mean spirited. I wish you trump supporters would stop. Your childishness is not going to convince anyone to vote republican. Also, do you have stocks? We lost a ton this time. Are you seriously proud of trump and the mess he has created?
6891 2018-03-24 20:00:40 Better check your facts bub. Bump stocks aren’t firearms. The ATF has no jurisdiction over them. You can’t just wave your arms and make wishes come true. Another day, another chapter of idiocy and lies in Trumplandia.
6892 2018-03-24 20:00:29 No matter which models you throw at me they are not a M4. 
Huge difference that selector switch makes. Safe/3round burst/full auto. 

Does a bump stick add accuracy or take it away? 
Maybe we should make bump stocks required as they reduce accuracy?
6893 2018-03-24 19:59:50 Way to straddle that issue, Senator. But you can’t argue that without bump stocks and assault weapons far fewer would be dead. And no one needs those to hunt or defend themselves. All about that #NRAmoney 
6894 2018-03-24 19:59:49 I'm for no guns in America the GOP is for unlimited guns so sensible compromise is no assault weapons bump stocks and large round clips to start
6895 2018-03-24 19:59:39 BAN THE AR 15! BAN BUMP STOCKS! GREAT STARTING POINT! NOT THAT DIFFICULT!!! GAAWWWDDD!
6896 2018-03-24 19:58:27 Inspired bump stocks lol and debt
6897 2018-03-24 19:58:25 No. The idea is to get a better handle on sensible gun control laws. This is not and never was a 2nd amend issue you morons. But, mandatory waiting periods, closing loopholes on bkgd checks, and banning assault-style military weapons and bump stocks are all good w most Americans.
6898 2018-03-24 19:58:11 Why didn't he call out the homegrown white terrorist from Austin and pray for the victims in the same way?
6899 2018-03-24 19:58:01 No. You don’t need to leave #facebook. No. They didn’t sell your data. Yes, the bad press will go away after having served the purpose of corporate investors. 
Only thing you need to do, if you can?
Buy #fb stocks while cheaper.
6900 2018-03-24 19:57:45 Remove trump stocks !!!!
6901 2018-03-24 19:57:41 Bump stocks are a hot topic but it's an easy target that doesn't do much. Lots of mass murderers have accomplished equal carnage without them. They serve a real purpose (helping those less able), so easy fix: doctor's note/regulatory approval are required to purchase one
6902 2018-03-24 19:56:54 Make it possible to 
pass Child Access Prevention laws 
ban bump stocks 
raise age limits 
Make gun control possible so that owning a gun is an acceptable thing because people know that it has to be done responsibly. 
NRA acts like irresponsible gun owners are a protected class
6903 2018-03-24 19:56:46 yes, it's a total disaster that will impact so, so, many lives .  How, HOW!!??  will we all live without bump stocks? Oh, the humanity!
6904 2018-03-24 19:56:32 Yeah, so basically the stock market will crash which ruins the rest of the economy for the rest of the US citizens. I dont really know much about how stocks work, but it's basically Wall Street goes broke and it fucks it up for everyone else.
6905 2018-03-24 19:56:30 Yessiree. Makes great tamales and broad base for canning. The taller one is fabulous for stocks.
6906 2018-03-24 19:56:16 Stocks don’t matter rn. There’s gonna be a complete reset of our financial system and a change in currency. No more big banks. He’s just putting on a show to distract the media.
6907 2018-03-24 19:55:41 He’s more credible than you are. You are always talking out of both sides of you mouth. 

How’s the stocks today? Is Trump still looking after them from his tower make of Chinese steel?
6908 2018-03-24 19:55:11 stacking penny stocks while I'm flipping these birds
6909 2018-03-24 19:54:59 Ah, more thoughts and prayers. Nothing wrong with those, but the  kids out today (you weren’t there) want political action behind the t&p and more than just bump stocks. That’s a no brainer.  Yes, people kill people. People with military type weapons kill a lot of people.
6910 2018-03-24 19:54:52 Common sense measures!  Universal background checks, close the gun show loophole, bump stocks and high capacity magazine bans, terrorists watch list and mental health checks.  We'll move to banning assault rifles next. #MarchForOurLives #NovemberIsComing
6911 2018-03-24 19:54:49 Banning bump stocks is like putting a band-aid on a severed artery.  Also the NRA told Trump they don't care about bump stocks so they gave him their permission to ban them.
6912 2018-03-24 19:54:41 In fact, the Obama Administration did NOT legalize or promote bump stocks. What the Obama Administration did is kill one of the most dangerous men in the world, tried to make Medicare affordable for the lower class and visited schools plagued by terrorism.Way more then you'll do.
6913 2018-03-24 19:53:57 When you go on with your trade war, stocks go down the drain 
6914 2018-03-24 19:53:57 Stock buybacks artificially inflate the price of stocks.  Guess who owns most of the stocks.
6915 2018-03-24 19:53:39 Demo gegen Trump?!  Die Waffengewalt ist NICHT durch Trump entstanden...und hat sein übel schon seit über Jahrzehnten.... Aber Trumps Verbietung von Bump Stocks...ist schon mal ein Schritt nach vorne
6916 2018-03-24 19:53:38 Well, I have heard plenty of them ask for universal background checks, bans of bump stocks, and high capacity magazines - that doesn’t sound like a repeal to me; which i would be against
6917 2018-03-24 19:53:25 They did at first. But they can see whats going on and they're starting to think this won't stop at bump stocks and age limits. They can't be the only dems thinking that way.
6918 2018-03-24 19:53:17 Didn’t he just ban bump stocks? Previous administration didn’t
6919 2018-03-24 19:52:46 And directly to you Mr. President. @realDonaldTrump @POTUS criminals will still break the law I’m disappointed with the omnibus in the attack on the second amendment thrown in as well as bump stocks we don’t even have the Vegas truth do we.
6920 2018-03-24 19:52:30 It was the Republican House that legalized bump stocks. Do you know any history at all?
6921 2018-03-24 19:51:50 Minimum set might be: no bump stocks. Real, universal background checks. National gun owner database. Allow CDC research. Ban assault weapons (or no magazines over 10 rounds). Harm-reduction approaches to lower death toll. The dream would go further, like safer gun technology.
6922 2018-03-24 19:51:47 Imagine there're no loop holes. 
Background checks indeed. 
No civilian assault weapons or bump stocks.
Despite NRA we can succeed.
Imagine the Senate & Congress doing what we need. Aw huh uh.
You may say I'm a dreamer but I'm not the only one.
6923 2018-03-24 19:51:42 Must Go: bump stocks, high capacity clips of any size gun. No private sales of military use weapons, public sale of armor piercing bullets of any cal.
6924 2018-03-24 19:51:35 You wouldn't know it, of course, but the harsh leftists are intentionally crashing to market for two reasons: to try to humiliate Trump and to crash energy stocks to enable purchase of energy stocks at the cheapest level in an attempt to take them over and change their policies.

Gold has been flat for almost 5 years in a bear market. Why not just buy stocks? Next flush coming.
6926 2018-03-24 19:51:03 The whole point is that they are protesting FOR the middle ground.  Universal background checks, banning bump stocks, etc. The NRA, the group who you told these kids buy into YOUR agenda, doesn’t want the middle ground
6927 2018-03-24 19:51:02 My expectations are much much higher. Common sense gun laws preventing the sales of assault rifles and bump stocks is a start.
6928 2018-03-24 19:50:35 Took you 5 months to ban Bump Stocks??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
And you are going to take credit for it??
You didn't even know what they were.
6929 2018-03-24 19:50:12 Yet we’ve still had “fully automatic weapons” due to bump stocks.  Since 1986. Nowbeing outlawed.  You don’t know much about guns. Also shows you want to argue about politics.  Kids see through this political crap. They are not following their parents politics. Well documented
6930 2018-03-24 19:49:09 I don't question a law abiding citizen who possess a gun,but I have to question a person who possesses an Assault weapon/s,bump stocks or multiple weapons!

6933 2018-03-24 19:47:34 Explain bump stocks to the American voters, we dont need to eride our Trump voters if they are misinformed. Voters care about being free in the future of the only country founded on freedom.
6934 2018-03-24 19:46:52 Right. What burns my ass is our ask is simple and a fragment of the industry. It’s one type of gun and banning bump stocks. even combat soldiers are on the front lines saying all that gun is 4 is killing.

6939 2018-03-24 19:46:04 The Obama administration did NOT legalize bump stocks. The republican NRA shit licking Congress did
6940 2018-03-24 19:46:03 #MarchForOurLives Boys got all their guns illegally, 3 from a legal adult girl from licensed dealers  at a gun show, 1 from a man breaking the law. They sawed shotgun barrels and stocks off, so NFA didn’t work. A joke they said on what’d be said after Columbine? “Make gun laws.”
6941 2018-03-24 19:45:52 RT: @BBC1946: Amid reports of fish stocks having radiation poisoning, the UN has been notified that Australia suspects underwater nuclear testing is to blame for the poisoning.
6942 2018-03-24 19:45:41 And someone has to let him buy the gun and the bump stocks for a weapon that is not designed for protection but for killing as many people as possible as quickly  as possible.
6943 2018-03-24 19:45:30 Bump stocks were just banned. Keep up!
6944 2018-03-24 19:45:29 Sure. Armed school officials are fine. Just ban assault weapons, bump stocks, large mags, and anything else that turns a pissed off kid into a small army.  Next?

6947 2018-03-24 19:44:48 @realDonaldTrump You are a pathological lier. Obama did not legalize bump stocks. He sincerely fought to change the Congress and senate to establish sensible gun regulations. Republicans stop him in every way they could. NRA just pays too well. You got over 30,000000.
6948 2018-03-24 19:43:40 Please don't bend @realDonaldTrump. Bump stocks, like any other weapon or object used as a weapon, still needs a person behind it.

6950 2018-03-24 19:43:32 4. Ban large capacity magazines and bump stocks
5. No gun sales to anyone under 21
6. Limit the number of guns and individual can purchase
7. Grandfather people who exceed limit but they have to pay an annual license and registration fee like a car
8. No private gun sales

6954 2018-03-24 19:42:50 Bump stocks are toast.
6955 2018-03-24 19:42:35 Yes...Trump said he will ban bump stocks, raise the age to buy a gun to 21, deal with the mental illness issue when buying a gun and much more. Your change is already happening
6956 2018-03-24 19:42:33 No Obama did not legalize bump stocks. That was merely an invention that went to market. There were no laws for or against them. You hold rallies inside of auditoriums for yourself. The rallies against you can only be held outside because no one building can fit that many people.
6957 2018-03-24 19:42:31 You promised to legalized assault rifles, now you're banning bump-stocks. Breaking promises, I REALLY hate that. You just became hero of the left.
6958 2018-03-24 19:42:13 #Correction#Obama did NOT “legalize” bump stocks#The GOP dominated Congress legalized bumpstocks#Impeach this lying, immoral, greedy president before he declares himself emperor
6959 2018-03-24 19:41:47 - Federal baseline "shall-issue" CCW laws, imposing required training & passing extensive tests for CCW applicants. Allow states & local municipalities to impose additional restrictions/requirements
- Ban bump stocks & other devices used to convert semi-autos to full-autos
6960 2018-03-24 19:41:47 We do need tougher gun laws such as baning bump stocks HOWEVER THE GOVERNMENT WILL USE THIS TO TAKE STEPS TO DISARM AMERICAN! GO READ #HR5087 NOW BEFORE ITS TO LATE! CALL YOUR SENATORS RIGHT NOW ABD TELL THEM #HR5087 WILL NOT FLY AND WE WANT THEM TO KEEP IT SIMPLE!

Thanks for this tweet Steve.
Let us remember that our economy is doing a lot better then during Obama's administration so let's start buying stocks Fund Managers.  
We are creating a lot of jobs here in our country.  Let's continue that trend.
Thank you.
6964 2018-03-24 19:40:15 No you buy bump stocks on the internet, still got to get the gun in person AFIK
6965 2018-03-24 19:40:09 Then tell me how many bump stocks, AR15s are used to murder in poor minority hoods where 90% of gun deaths happen? All rifles combined resulted in less than 400 deaths last year nationwide. Yes tragic, but not a reason to give up ur rights.
6966 2018-03-24 19:39:58 My stocks really holding me down
6967 2018-03-24 19:39:33 Stop school violence act and bump stocks is your way to pacify.  These should have been done a long time ago. Got tabled by NRA influence on Washington politicians.  Short, once again. Disappointed  #neveragain
6968 2018-03-24 19:38:23 You are lying again. Obama did not approve bump stocks.
6969 2018-03-24 19:38:05 The sell-off in stocks will cost wealthy Americans more than the imposed tariff on $ 60 billion Chinese exports
6970 2018-03-24 19:37:45 We believe that a national legislative package should do the following:

• Eliminate Bump Stocks
• Limit High Capacity Magazines & Armor Piercing Ammo
• Express Support for 2nd Amendment Rights
• Raise the limit for all Gun Sales to 21 Years of Age 

#MarchForOurLives
6971 2018-03-24 19:37:41 I honestly don't care and don't have a horse in this race.  I'm just pointing out obvious implications and trajectories.  I give zero fucks if bump stocks exist or not.

Just pointing out that they don't actually do anything you can't learn in a few minutes on YouTube tool-less.
6972 2018-03-24 19:37:40 You're the guy who told everyone to sell their stocks after the election, right?  I think ill get my economic information elsewhere....thanks.
6973 2018-03-24 19:37:27 What do you know about bump stocks? 

Have you ever purchased a weapon from armslist? 

Do you think violence is a disease?
6974 2018-03-24 19:37:01 And hasn't the NRA stated they're ok with doing away with bump stocks?
6975 2018-03-24 19:36:26 Yeah that President legalized Bump stocks. Smh.
6976 2018-03-24 19:35:43 WHAT???? This is what you tweet today when Americans are out in the millions protesting something you can fix.  My bad....you Banned bump stocks yesterday. I guess you think your work here is done.  It's time to lead this Country....no just your deplorable base!!!
6977 2018-03-24 19:35:23 #PROP is to be used like putting people in stocks in the Middle Ages displaying them to public scorn in order to discourage them from seeking medication to ease their agony, but the agony is so bad that #CPP & #IPP will endure the humiliation to avoid pain and suicide.

6978 2018-03-24 19:34:49 And we have worked so hard to mainting our cod stocks.  Sounds like another cod war looming although not with Iceland. Where do they fit in all this I wonder?
6979 2018-03-24 19:34:40 @realDonaldTrump  Banning Bump stocks is good, but it is not enough. #MarchForOurLives #GunControlNow #NeverAgain
6980 2018-03-24 19:34:38 Alright, first up, let's ban those bump stocks. One of the dumbest things that came out of the obama administration next to Operation Fast and Furious.

6982 2018-03-24 19:34:26 You are wrong,Trump!Obama did not legalize bump stocks. Bump They cannot be controlled under current law, it does not allow for its regulation.The ATF must change the way it interprets the National Firearms Act or issue new legislation that will allow the device to be regulated.
6983 2018-03-24 19:34:18 How would they “spray” bullets unless they had a fully automatic weapon. I’ve stated before that I think bump stocks should not be easily accessible to the general public. Secure the schools. Right now most public schools are extremely soft targets. Most of those mass shooters...
6984 2018-03-24 19:34:13 But this is exactly the problem.

There isn't a sane person who supports pump stocks (well, at least since the Obama administration approved them).

The problem are all the fcukwits out there that want to ban any form of firearm.
6985 2018-03-24 19:33:14 Lying lying lying. President Obama did not legalize bump stocks get your facts straight you are the most corrupt president in the history of our country you are number one at being the worst and you will be jailed.
6986 2018-03-24 19:32:45 I don’t think anyone is trying to take that away. Just more strict purchasing laws, which wouldn’t affect anybody legally able to have a gun, and bans on things like bump stocks which aren’t necessary for civilians. The 2nd amendment itself isn’t being threatened.
6987 2018-03-24 19:32:44 Sweet! I can transfer my stocks from fidelity! 
6988 2018-03-24 19:32:42 This is a lie; Obama admin did not LEGALIZE bump stocks. From the size of your inauguration, to your threat to veto the just signed budget, you have ignored the truth; you make stuff up. Words, candor, truth matter. Because you don't respect that you'll only hurt America.
6989 2018-03-24 19:32:15 “Urn”? Is that a Freudian slip on the part of the propaganda arm of the US government? Bump stocks. That’s all they got? Despicable.
6990 2018-03-24 19:32:04 Bumps stocks work so well they are used by NONE of the military branches, SOC, or LEO
6991 2018-03-24 19:31:46 How nice. Now that you've had a nice, long movie break, how about you and your "great negotiator" president take action toward MEANINGFUL gun reform? Banning bump stocks is barely the tip of the iceberg. #neveragain #GunControlNow #GunReformNow
6992 2018-03-24 19:31:39 Why not give up bump stocks and pass HPA. Give and take. If nobody knew what was in the budget we just passed and you were extremely upset with it, why not turn the tables and make sure something is slipped into this whole bump stock scenerio. That's exactly why we voted for you
6993 2018-03-24 19:30:41 Jethro, you know you are being an asswaffle, right? I have owned guns in the past, I may own them in the future. I have great aim and love shooting at the range. I also think that universal background checks make sense, no bump stocks, no semi-automatic guns make sense.
6994 2018-03-24 19:30:15 If you're going to worry about short-term volatility, you're just not going to be able to buy the cheapest stocks. With the cheapest stocks, the outlooks are uncertain. - Richard Pzena
6995 2018-03-24 19:29:40 Make each category of weapon require different training, licensure, registration, and insurance. Have a minimum age requirement. 

Ban high-capacity magazines, bump stocks, and rounds designed to penetrate armor. 

Just like we do vehicles, boats, aircraft, dental tools...
6996 2018-03-24 19:29:13 Hmmm, does this mean you'll very soon be ditching all those stocks in Russian interests and instead be investing in G4S?  My pal Donald likes to keep an eye on the Exchange...
6997 2018-03-24 19:29:02 Fine. Few women commit mass murder. I don’t have a problem with well-trained, decent people having guns. I don’t think anyone needs an AR-15 to defend themselves. Nor bump stocks, or magazines with high capacity.
6998 2018-03-24 19:28:43 Or, as a responsible gun owner, it should anger you that those who aren’t, are able to get guns and harm others. Fix NICS, add Red Flag laws, universal background cks, no bump stocks, at the least.
6999 2018-03-24 19:27:52 Stop. Lying.

@BarackObama administration did not legalize bump stocks. 

@BarackObama issued EOs creating stricter controls, but could not legally restrict (non mechanical) bump stocks without new laws. 

Congress refused to do so.

All of which @realDonaldTrump has rolled back.
7000 2018-03-24 19:27:14 Banning bump stocks is a waste. No more military assault rifles. Time to stand up to the NRA.
7001 2018-03-24 19:26:28 Good thing Trump is banning bump stocks. Now the pressure to enact more gun control will dissipate probably.

7008 2018-03-24 19:24:19 A million strong JUST IN DC!!! Your A$$ is grass if you don’t so more than Bump Stocks and theses kids are the mowers.
7009 2018-03-24 19:23:47 "infringement of #2A".  You continue to spout that, yet, give no evidence as to how 100 round magazines, bump stocks, military style weapons that can fire 500 rounds in less than 5 minutes have a damn thing to do with #2A.   THEY DON'T
7010 2018-03-24 19:23:35 Dear @Twitter promotion algorithms,

Your periodic reminder that I block all alcohol and gambling promos that appear in my timeline. Including stocks/investment/ppi.

7011 2018-03-24 19:23:26 Is there any reason for picking bank stocks for intraday ?
7012 2018-03-24 19:23:23 Banning military weapons, bump stocks and vest piercing bullets.....sounds reasonable to me. I get age verified for sudafed.
7013 2018-03-24 19:22:16 From the stage a speaker listed 
1) universal background checks 
2) no high-capacity magazines 
3) no bump stocks each to big applause, so pretty unified at least on those stances.
7014 2018-03-24 19:22:11 TD sequential and whole lots others - I used them for a long time in stocks then finally gave up. Now I just use11d/22d EMA, MACD and Volume. What has been your experience with deMark indicators in cryptos?
7015 2018-03-24 19:21:50 I added Robinhood and Coinbase as well if anyone wanted to jump into understanding stocks at the entry level or cryptocurrencies respectively.
7016 2018-03-24 19:21:42 Going to get interesting when the easy low hanging fruit, i.e., background checks, bump stocks, CDC study,etc.,  are used up and Congress and POTUS left with the difficult stuff- AR15's, large cap magazines, age limits, etc.
7017 2018-03-24 19:21:41 Also, Trump hasn’t done anything other than an attempt to ban bump stocks, which he can’t do without Congress per SCOTUS. He’s left it to the states. As usual, he put out a lot of talk with no action behind it.
7018 2018-03-24 19:21:14 With highest debt ever that will be downfall. Stocks in chaos, all gains lost, no wall, no hcare, no VA fix, swamp slime grows
7019 2018-03-24 19:20:43 For crying out...@marcorubio ! We are not asking for a gun ban! We want common sense reform! Background checks! Increased age limit. Ban bump stocks and Assault rifles! Why is this so hard to accept?! #Resist #VetsForGunReform
7020 2018-03-24 19:19:25 it is now. No full auto, no bump stocks. All semi-auto ok. In case of revolution that should be sufficient.
7021 2018-03-24 19:19:13 Why aren’t you with the children & adults who are fighting to get our government to create legislation that outlaws the sale of guns & bump stocks to minors, @realDonaldTrump? When are you & so many other politicians going to stop taking #bloodmoney from the @NRA? #FuckTheNRA
7022 2018-03-24 19:18:00 Stocks would have plunged. Bad.
7023 2018-03-24 19:17:53 Here’s another one for you: Mental health of the perpetrator does not have an impact on the number of casualties in a mass shooting. Use of weapons like high powered, high round semi/auto guns with or with out bump stocks do have a direct correlation with the # of casualties
7024 2018-03-24 19:17:44 Is that why he banned Bump Stocks and signed in the budget bill stricter background checks? You obviously are uneducated!
7025 2018-03-24 19:17:41 Scott, stick to stocks where you demonstrate a level of expertise.  Firearms, should be off limits to you.  As a father of 2 I prefer to focus on real risks to my daughters safety.  Firearms are far down the list.. How about drunk drivers, or distracted drivers? Sex traffickers?
7026 2018-03-24 19:17:32 Doesn’t understand 2nd amend or big picture. People kill people guns don’t. Agree with changes to bump stocks and tighter buyer laws but will it be enforced? States have different buying laws so it’s tough to restrict;anyone can drive across state lines
7027 2018-03-24 19:17:28 No ONE WANTS TO REPEAL THE 2ND AMENDMENT for a 
" WELL REGULATED MILITIA"
THE BAN REQUEST IS FOR ASSAULT WEAPONS & BUMP STOCKS FROM BEING SOLD.
Age limit to 21Universal back-ground checks IS AN ASSAULT RIFLE WORTH EVEN 1 LIFE? CHILD OR ADULTTHEIR SMILE LAUGHTER LOVE IS IT???
7028 2018-03-24 19:17:00 true, im surprised and glad trump killed bump stocks that quick. didnt let congress or nra be dumb about it. shits are too ridiculous and unnecessary
7029 2018-03-24 19:16:46 Simply put, it was his way of saying that he does not care about Nifty or Sensex levels, in a humorous way. If your “level” is ok, then look at value stocks and not the Nifty or Sensex....
7030 2018-03-24 19:16:44 أن أنحدر شاري وأن أرتفع بايع! هذا السوق! بكره بطيح على خشمه! وينك يا بو حضووووب! لا حووووووووول!
7031 2018-03-24 19:16:32 They just didn’t have the Soros funding they have now. Bump stocks used under obama and he did nothing. Trump is fixing that for us.
7032 2018-03-24 19:15:56 Definitely not a stakeholder. This isn't stocks nor an investment deal involving projects.
7033 2018-03-24 19:15:39 You love Executive Orders, so sign one that bans military-style assault weapons and bump stocks NOW! You have the power and you have the authority to ban these weapons of war.  Do you have the courage to spit in the face of the NRA? #NeverAgain
#MarchForOurLives #EnoughIsEnough
7034 2018-03-24 19:15:09 Did I miss the part where banning bump stocks became a law? I don’t understand how he can suggest that’s happening with processs and compromise, when congress refuses to vote on bump stocks?
7035 2018-03-24 19:14:47 That question holes in it like Fox Noise fact-o-meters! If you bothered to look at legitimate questions: Do you want your school age child killed while in school? Why do legitimate gun owners need assault weapons? Pro or anti bump stocks? Slanted questioning, slanted responses.
7036 2018-03-24 19:14:22 I hope that @realDonaldTrump knows that banning Bump stocks will not stop them from being used. Banning the bump stocks will probably make it worse. They will probably just become illegal contraband and sold on the black market or some other way.
7037 2018-03-24 19:13:56 So all gun protests will stop once the government expands background checks, bans bump stocks, bans "assault weapons", and bans "high capacity magazine clips", right?

7041 2018-03-24 19:12:53 God given right? I thought God was about that whole "thou shall not kill" thing, not "thou shall have AR-15s with optional bump stocks" 
7042 2018-03-24 19:12:53 Another March that I ‘m trying to understand the goal. I’m told it’s for background checks (already happens) and restricting bump stocks (in the works)...what else? I want real answers not just “reasonable gun control”.
7043 2018-03-24 19:12:36 Assault style weapons? Banned? yes.  Large capacity magazines BANNED, yes.  Bump stocks BANNED, yes. Anything able to convert semi auto to auto, BANNED, yes. 

Not BANNING all guns, but certain guns...and tools to make those guns more deadly on a large scale. yes.
7044 2018-03-24 19:12:33 Lies. Lies. Lies. A law is needed to ban bump stocks. Obama can’t legaIize something. He issued executive orders within the legal framework to limit gun violatence. 

You rolled them all back. 

GOP congress refused to work with Obama on new gun legislation. 

This is on you.
7045 2018-03-24 19:11:44 Let's Fact Check Trump's Last Tweet: 

Obama did not approve Bump Stocks.  His administration simply found that the current LAWS did not prohibit them.

Obama tried for gun control but the GOP pushed back every time

Not stop your BLATANT lies!

7047 2018-03-24 19:10:31 Your tweet should go viral. The left have no clue that Obama legalized bump stocks. They blame you for everything. Thank the Lord for your strength of character.
7048 2018-03-24 19:10:27 Shows what you know...not much.
The protest is specifically against the NRA. 
As for ideas:
Strengthen background checks
Stop gun show loophole sales
Require national registration
Ban assault weapons
Ban bump stocks
Ban large capacity magazines
Mandatory waiting periods
7049 2018-03-24 19:10:21 Hi Lisa, I am sorry that we have been unable to book you an appointment for your preferred session. Our sessions can get booked up quickly and appreciate that this can be frustrating. Blood stocks are at critical levels due to the recent bad weather. (1/2)
7050 2018-03-24 19:09:52 We havent been threaten since the colonial times to be in dire need of semi auto weapons and bump stocks....
7051 2018-03-24 19:08:28 If you believe banning bump stocks is anything other than a waste of time then you must not know how easy they are to make.
7052 2018-03-24 19:08:25 The ATF not being able to regulate two specific types of stocks doesn’t qualify as approval by Obama.  

That’s the definition of false equivalence and thus a lie, one of your unending stream.

It does show how clueless you are and an empty shill for the terrorist @NRA’s agenda.
7053 2018-03-24 19:08:12 Except he didn’t. Bump stocks were legal long before Obama #howaboutthetruth
7054 2018-03-24 19:07:46 Last gun control bill signed into law before this week was way back in 2007.

Trump signed Fix NICS — and his administration announced its proposed regulation banning bump stocks — yesterday.
7055 2018-03-24 19:07:14 That’s cute. You think bump stocks are an ending point. 
7056 2018-03-24 19:07:06 You only started investing in stocks at the end of Jan bud? Pro tip don't invest in stocks unless you have a long term horizon. Better yet try not to get in 9 years into a bull market after being on sidelines.
7057 2018-03-24 19:07:03 Can someone explain why someone needs a AR 15 for personal use. We aren't talking about hand guns, hunting equipment. They are talking about the assult weapons and the equipment. Finally getting movement on bump stocks, That should happened months ago. It@marcorubio
7058 2018-03-24 19:06:19 No dumbass. Obama did not legalize bump stocks. ICYMI, there’s a huge march across the US today. You’ll regret putting Russia first.

By the way.....virtually no one wants to take pistols  (protection) or hunting rifles away from sane, law abiding, responsible gun owners. We want assault rifles properly defined and banned along with bump stocks and large capacity magazines.
7061 2018-03-24 19:05:26 So wait....OBAMA legalized bump stocks?
....OBAMA....
7062 2018-03-24 19:05:16 I hope this works we don't need bump stocks we don't need 30 round magazine's and change the age to 21 doest heard a damn thing
7063 2018-03-24 19:04:57 #Pittsburgh #MarchForOurLives Close the gun show loophole. Universal background checks. Ban high capacity magazines and assault rifles. Ban bump stocks. Raise the age limit to 21.
7064 2018-03-24 19:04:47 They are Bump stocks not hump stocks and NO, Obama didn’t legalize them.  Stop believing the lies coming from our current White House!  #neveragain #trumplies
7065 2018-03-24 19:04:23 My uncle just called me asking if he should dump all his stocks because the market is gonna crash on Monday.... sounds like the bottom to me
7066 2018-03-24 19:04:22 That is a lie --Obama Admin. did not legalize BUMP STOCKS
7067 2018-03-24 19:03:43 Go away obama you did enough damage to this country. Bump stocks went on unde you
7068 2018-03-24 19:03:18 like Obama approving the sale of bump stocks? Democrats did SOOOO much for gun control! ha
7069 2018-03-24 19:03:11 2) We already have gun control. However, I support further efforts to clean up and improve current gun controls such as a 21 year-old age limit to gun ownership and criminalize bump stocks as just two examples of many more measures I support.

7072 2018-03-24 19:02:59 Obama administration allowed bump stocks.  Trump administration to ban them.  Once again, Trump is cleaning up the failures of the liberal agenda and Democrat inaction.
7073 2018-03-24 19:02:55 And before you say it, bump stocks DO NOT make semi-auto’s full auto. Only rapid fire. 
Do agree with banning.
7074 2018-03-24 19:02:51 Here is what Obama did to combat school shootings.......Made bump stocks legal and armed Mexican drug lords to kill an American and over 100,000 Mexican citizens!!!!!!!!!    Against the advice from the NRA by the way   #TheRealFactsFirst #FakeNewsFirstCNN
7075 2018-03-24 19:02:23 Generally prefer to dive into sectors since opportunities are not available for too long. SIP is for a diverse set of stocks / PF
7076 2018-03-24 19:01:49 Obama didn't "legalize" bump stocks. The ATF decided it couldn't regulate them on two occasions during Obama's administration. It wasn't that bump stocks were legalized. But rather, the law at the time did not permit them to be prohibited.
7077 2018-03-24 19:01:46 Limit mag capacity, outlaw bump stocks, universal background checks, age limits. These aren’t ridiculous demands. Responsible gun owners support this & are getting a bad rap b/c of the NRA’s rhetoric.

7079 2018-03-24 19:01:34 #Vermont House took action on gun control. 

Banned bump stocks
Expanded federal background checks to all private sales 

Banned high-capacity magazines

 Raised the minimum age to purchase a gun from 18 to 21

Keep marching. You are making change.

7080 2018-03-24 19:01:19 DOJ rule banning bump stocks is probably another Trump administration "Fake Rule" because it will be contested in court and never really put into force.
7081 2018-03-24 19:01:06 You would have been better off staying silent.  No one is asking for an all out ban.  Sensible regulations.  Universal background checks. Ban bump stocks and assault weapons. 

 Go hug your NRA money, you fraud.

7083 2018-03-24 19:00:51 @BinsackSb notice how all the talk after Vegas was bump stocks. Not even so much Ar15 but bump stocks. Honestly I don’t think most people knew what a bump stock was before Las Vegas. Was bump stocks lagging in sales at the time ??
7084 2018-03-24 19:00:50 @realDonaldTrump Talk about bump stocks, mental health and community awareness, accountability for all law enforcement & the public.
7085 2018-03-24 19:00:43 They don't.  Why do conservative keep saying that.  They have never said that. Only Assault weapons & bump stocks that's it.   And common sense things like closed loopholes, 21yrs old to buy,  and background checks.  I don't know how 100% of the people wouldn't support that.

7087 2018-03-24 19:00:13 I welcome it. At this point it's not even to prove a point about bump stocks and I'm just genuinely interested.
7088 2018-03-24 18:59:53 The fact that Trump is obviously planning to ban bump stocks is enough to tell you that he is not a supporter of your rights. Any concession on gun rights, no matter how small, is one more freedom that you no longer possess.
7089 2018-03-24 18:59:47 At the same time, kinda more surprised that a Winsome is very light than I am of Alan R Moon (T2R) doing 1869 (Couple of clues, like a T2R map having stocks as Set Majority and the setting of 1869 being used in another map [Old West])
7090 2018-03-24 18:59:44 Because semi-automatic guns and bump stocks were the intention of the second amendment, right?
7091 2018-03-24 18:59:42 Tweet from @Stonekettle called BS: "This is a lie. Obama administration didn't legalize bump stocks. Obama issued EOs creating stricter controls (all of which Trump has rolled back), but could not legally restrict (non mechanical) bump stocks without new laws. Congress refused"
7092 2018-03-24 18:59:23 bump stocks were loaded. Full. Metal. Jacket.

7094 2018-03-24 18:58:25 The only person I would recommend who is genuine and an excellent experienced trader both in stocks and crypto is Dan from chart guys. Any guys who want to learn TA should watch their hundreds of hours of free TA videos on YouTube. No shilling in sight. 
7095 2018-03-24 18:58:18 C’mon, man. I’m a shooter too. We all know the score. And we shouldn’t be afraid to say publicly what we say to each other in private. I know bump-stocks and drum-mags and bleeding zombie targets are legal, but the people who go in for that stuff are total tools.
7096 2018-03-24 18:58:15 You signed a bill that made bump stocks legal
7097 2018-03-24 18:57:31 Obama's ATF Approved Bump Stocks 2010. Where were you then? Didn’t here a word from you
7098 2018-03-24 18:57:18 Sure. And what will u tell us tomorrow? The lie here, is Obama did NOT legalize bump stocks! Do u ever get tired of lying?
7099 2018-03-24 18:56:53 You're nuts. Bump fire stocks don't increase the rate of a semi-auto any more than me pulling the trigger every 2 seconds and then every .2 seconds. You clearly have no idea what you're talking about.
7100 2018-03-24 18:56:37 You mean the guy who wants to ban bump stocks when Obama admin made them legal? Oooooooooops. Pipe down you have no idea what you are talking about.
7101 2018-03-24 18:55:36 Obama's ATF Approved Bump Stocks 2010.   Where were you than Chuckie ?
7102 2018-03-24 18:54:35 But they aren’t 100 rounds per minute by default. Automatic weapons aren’t available to the public (you need a special federal license with rigorous testing). The problem in this case is bump stocks.
7103 2018-03-24 18:54:32 Capitalism made out of Soy sauce packet! WHILE STOCKS LAST!
7104 2018-03-24 18:54:14 This is an exaggeration. It was deemed an accessory by the ATF in 2010 ...bump stocks don't have any moving parts, they are a "firearm part" and could not be regulated as a firearm under existing gun laws. You owe the people of this planet an apology for existing. Grow up bully.
7105 2018-03-24 18:54:07 So it was a bad idea. You say yourself it's a bad idea. So POTUS get rid of bump stocks it's a bad idea
7106 2018-03-24 18:53:40 Lol! You won’t be able to blame anyone else if you lose on that trade. It’s worst than speculating on penny stocks.
7107 2018-03-24 18:53:39 @guntalk 1/2 Article in Orlando Sentinel.  High school students want a ban on bump stocks (never used in a school shooting to my knowledge); anyone purchasing “assault weapon” be 21.  Again, assault weapon is a term made up by the media. Students think ARs are assault weapons.
7108 2018-03-24 18:51:49 He's been bearish on Bonds, but I was not sure if @MagicPoopCannon was bearish on Bonds + Stocks.
7109 2018-03-24 18:51:35 Common ground? The GOP can't even bring itself to ban bump stocks. You can't get yourselves out of the NRA's pockets to pass basic legislation to prevent guns from getting into certain hands, not even banning any specific gun. You are complicit in every one of these murders.
7110 2018-03-24 18:51:23 Meh, bump stocks. If someone wants one they’ll make one. It isn’t hard. They won’t like you no matter how many stupid laws you promote nor how much you sound like them. But your supporters WILL stop supporting you. 

Be careful.
7111 2018-03-24 18:51:13 It’s not about taking those rights away. It’s about enacting better laws regulating who and what guns should be allowed. Assault rifles and bump stocks don’t make us safer. #MarchForOurLives
7112 2018-03-24 18:51:04 All they know how to do is trade low float stocks . When they try stocks like apple they get destroyed . I’ve asked numerous times why and where is the volume ? No volume until they alert the stock in a chat room and then dump on people then brag about profits.

7118 2018-03-24 18:49:02 Obama LEGALIZED BUMP STOCKS! Give your hero/Community Organizer the credit he deserved we know who ORCHESTRATED THESE PROTESTS
7119 2018-03-24 18:48:59 “We want change.” 

Change is already happening. Trump ban on bump stocks. Congress passing the Stop School Violence act.

Did not hear one mention of that at the rallies.
7120 2018-03-24 18:48:15 The draggers Chase down the bio mass so they report no decline resulting in a stock that will never recover. If that practice of the Fed's is not stopped NLers will be forced to protect the stocks. Years ago the net holes were too small fishers ran the lines and sunk the nets.
7121 2018-03-24 18:48:05 This week should remind you that firearms stocks are going bullish.
7122 2018-03-24 18:47:24 Anyone who knows anything knows this.  But bump stocks cease to be an issue if we ban military type assault weapons.
7123 2018-03-24 18:47:23 how did you learn about stocks? I’ve been wanting to get into it.
7124 2018-03-24 18:47:07 Wrong, @realDonaldTrump . The Obama administration did not legalize bump stocks; it tried, but found that they are legal under existing law and thus could not be banned. If you want Congress to change that, good luck. #MarchForOurLives #NeverAgain @donlemon
7125 2018-03-24 18:46:19 Tariff wars benefit no one & tax bill benefits  only corporations who're not using it to increase hires but plowing it back into their stocks. And Trump doesn't slip--he just doesn't have any core beliefs except whatever benefits him.
7126 2018-03-24 18:46:18 All i hear from the left is guns guns guns...  Weren't they in power the last 8 years?  Did i miss something cause during that time didnt it get easier to get guns?  Weren't bump stocks made legal by osama?  Dont worry lefties trump will save you (unlike your own party)
7127 2018-03-24 18:46:07 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to cure your carpal tunnel syndrome
7128 2018-03-24 18:45:56 You approved bump stocks after shedding crocodile tears at Sandy Hook
7129 2018-03-24 18:45:53 This is a half truth under the existing law Obama could not legally ban bump stocks to say he approved their sales is a flat out lie are you going to watch 60 minutes tomorrow?
7130 2018-03-24 18:45:27 @POTUS is already working on comprehensive background checks w/emphasis on Mental Health, raising age to 21 & ending sale of Bump Stocks, along w/arming resource officers, security guards & some qualified school personnel to protect school's/kids but dems reject this  WHY?
7131 2018-03-24 18:45:17 Nothing...... Except the billions of $$ from the NRA who believe everybody has a constitutional right to pack assault rifles with  bump stocks and 50+ round magazines. Some "well regulated militia"?

7136 2018-03-24 18:42:22 I was fine with the background checks and bump stocks. however not doing business with people who won't sell to anyone under 21 is a violation of rights. and high capacity magazines shouldnt be under fire here either. does anyone even know what the second amendment is for?
7137 2018-03-24 18:41:45 Even though some municipal authorities had stocks of stable iodine, they were not distributed.
7138 2018-03-24 18:41:13 All I did was comment on his post to tell him bumper stocks are accessories, not arms. LOL
7139 2018-03-24 18:40:51 The problem is so many loopholes to close, need to start somewhere.  Assault rifles, high capacity magazines, bump stocks, armor piercing rounds, universal gun checks for ALL gun purchases.
7140 2018-03-24 18:40:50 CUZ NOBODY BUT YOU CARE ABOUT BUMP STOCKS, SWEETIE. WE DO CARE ABOUT ALL OF THE MONEY YOU’VE ACCEPTED FROM THE NRA THOUGH. WHEN YA GONNA TWEET ABOUT THAT AND STOP TRYING TO MAKE CURRENT GUN VIOLENCE EVERYONE ELSE’S FAULT BUT YOUR OWN.
7141 2018-03-24 18:40:04 Gospel of John: Jesus armed the masses with 5 ARs and 2 bump stocks.
7142 2018-03-24 18:40:01 I am a proud Air Force veteran and I support a ban on assault rifles and bump stocks. Stricter background checks and more mental health services. #marchforourlives
7143 2018-03-24 18:39:58 @realDonaldTrump So...no tweet about the March for Our Lives?  Too busy taking NRA money, or too afraid to speak up, or too busy having another affair?  BTW: You lied about Obama and bump stocks...it was the GOP that blocked any gun control progress...just like you.  Pathetic.
7144 2018-03-24 18:39:43 Banning bump stocks, big magazines, and ARs is just the beginning.

Let's get to the real cause.

Ban the GOP.

.
7145 2018-03-24 18:39:35 Hump stocks: Trump's side pieces.
7146 2018-03-24 18:39:19 Pretty sure the muzzle velocity and maximum point effective ranges are similar. At least the Army was nice enough to give us semi and we didn’t have to scrounge gun shows for lower receiver mods or bump stocks to make it fire more.
7147 2018-03-24 18:39:02 and Canada.  High school kids love to do this, of course, marching for causes. It's modern day Viet Nam in Ottawa today. Our legislators are pretty meek though, only passing rudimentary changes. And bump stocks in USA, what a capitulation.
7148 2018-03-24 18:39:00 If only France would have banned bump stocks? Oh wait! France has banned all guns! How can this be???
7149 2018-03-24 18:38:46 Im All for Universal Background Checks, Raising tha Age Limit on CERTAIN Rifles, & of Course Banning tha Manufacturing & Distribution of Bump Stocks, but that's about it, I Think, in Regards to Gun Control.. But #ThatsJustMe
7150 2018-03-24 18:38:36 O Obama’s was absolutely one of the worst presidents but all these liberal brainwashed people hated bump stocks when the Vegas shooting happened but the Obama administration legalized them but you didn’t hear anything about it because it didn’t correlate to the liberal agenda
7151 2018-03-24 18:38:21 Fuck, I forgot Texas plays three stocks still.
7152 2018-03-24 18:37:02 When will we gain the advantage of LOGIC, it would make life so much easier..I'm sure theres plenty of sustainable fish stocks 4 all...lets just start Sharing please and stop worrying about who's ripping who.....x
7153 2018-03-24 18:37:01 Universal background checks, 7 day minimum waiting period, no bump stocks, no automatic weapons. How's that for a start?
7154 2018-03-24 18:36:15 Unfortunately it will not. You guys went full leftist. Ruined any hope of progress you had. You will get bump stocks. Maybe more background checks. Thats about it. I think 21 yr age limit will get tossed in court.
7155 2018-03-24 18:35:57 And to prove my point I have commented that bump stocks and AR15’s should be illegal
7156 2018-03-24 18:35:53 Aguilar belongs on this roster. This is a direct impact of the Brewers not moving Santana. Once the verbal agreement was made with Cain and before made public is when Santana should have been moved. Instead you devalued your RF with teams knowing full well you have 0 leverage
7157 2018-03-24 18:35:50 The NRA didn't have thing to do with it, right?  Who voted in congress to legalize bump stocks, do you even know?  You got $30 million from the NRA, for what?  Your nothing but a liar, slime ball cheater and criminal without 1 oz. of integrity and should be impeached and in jail.
7158 2018-03-24 18:34:27 @DonaldJTrumpJr 18 yr old can work a machine gun, Not Bump Stocks and die for this country under President's command. Please do not INFRINGE on their 2nd Amendment RIGHTS.
7159 2018-03-24 18:34:03 @EricTrump 18 yr old can work a machine gun, Not Bump Stocks and die for this country under President's command. Please do not INFRINGE on their 2nd Amendment RIGHTS.
7160 2018-03-24 18:33:49 All in with no Stop Loss? How did he sleep at night? 
And here I am, fretting over diversified portfolio of 16 stocks, thinking it's too little diversification :-D
7161 2018-03-24 18:33:41 He’s talking about bump stocks
7162 2018-03-24 18:33:34 Penny stocks right?
7163 2018-03-24 18:33:26 On a day where millions around the world marching against violence, how about talking about change HERE to prevent more violence? Regulating bump stocks and “fixing NICKS” is a pathetic and weak response. But, I’d hate to interrupt your golf game...
7164 2018-03-24 18:33:12 @realDonaldTrump 18 yr old can work a machine gun, Not Bump Stocks and die for this country under your command. Please do not INFRINGE on their 2nd Amendment RIGHTS.
7165 2018-03-24 18:32:59 Or at least cease and desist on rocket launcher bump stocks. 
7166 2018-03-24 18:32:53 Bump stocks weren’t involved in parkland shooting, AR-15’s were.
7167 2018-03-24 18:32:25 Whats even more hilarious is that you can bumpfire without one of those specialty stocks.
7168 2018-03-24 18:32:07 Would seem quite odd obama would approve bump stocks in the first place...
7169 2018-03-24 18:31:31 Rubber bands (instead of bump stocks) can be used to bump fire and guns can be 3D-printed. Gun control will be rendered archaic regardless of well intentions, sir.
7170 2018-03-24 18:31:31 You are lying !!!
you are misrepresenting the truth!  people can own guns they just cannot own military assault weapons with rapidfire bump stocks and magazines that hold dozens of bullets!
7171 2018-03-24 18:31:29 And bump stocks made a difference when? Come on America! Do your homework. ANY access to deadly weapons ought be reviewed and revised. Bump stocks are the distraction the NRA and the GOP are hoping for.
7172 2018-03-24 18:30:47 They say one of their goals is to keep guns away from those who should not have them. Ok i agree with that. But Obama armed drug cartels and destroyed record of those weapons. He also approved bump stocks. I did not see anyone protesting about that.
7173 2018-03-24 18:30:10 In the year following the massacre in Newtown, the 3 largest gunmakers—Sturm Ruger, Remington Outdoor, and Smith & Wesson—netted more than $390 million in profits on record sales. Shares in gun mfg stocks jumped up 70% that year, benefitting Vanguard, Blackrock, and Fidelity
7174 2018-03-24 18:29:33 Yeah...the stocks R soaring Lol! Stores R closing everywhere, the trade wars R going 2 bankrupt companies and those farmers who voted for him are REGRETTING IT!They are headed for trouble financially! He did this during a temper tantrum! No idea what damage it wld. do, the idiot!
7175 2018-03-24 18:28:07 There are likely millions of young people marching across the country & around the world to end gun violence through the banning of assault rifles that are designed to shred bodies, high capacity magazines & bump stocks & other accessories that turn rifles into machine guns.
7176 2018-03-24 18:27:48 I'm against bump stocks I don't think our background check is up to snuff I think that guns should be regulated more at federal level I don't think we need to hurt law abiding gun owners to do so
7177 2018-03-24 18:27:40 #MarchForOurLives @BarackObama Politifact explained the thinking on bump stocks. It was written into the law. You have said you could have done more. Approving it is absolutely not true. You can't approve a law that already exists. @realDonaldTrump distortion.
7178 2018-03-24 18:27:33 just like the way investors bid up the prices above its rightful value, the same thing can happen the other way too. Though we should re-run risk assessments on individual positions, they need not track indices. wud u want your stocks to track the indices on the upside?
7179 2018-03-24 18:27:30 Oh my goddddddd, gun law reform does not equal the government taking everyone's guns. A universal background check system would be great! Or a ban on bump stocks! So many kids die every year in America because we as a country do not prioritize GUN SAFETY.
7180 2018-03-24 18:27:18 Ok, here we go!New laws.Rapists- castrate & deport if IslamicTerrorists-Capital punishmentPaedophiles -castrate and lock into stocks
7181 2018-03-24 18:27:15 Donald Trump’s Bizarro World: If he’s going to ban something, he might as well ban bump stocks. They’re not very popular because they don’t work!
7182 2018-03-24 18:27:10 Trump did not put any of the current gun laws in place. Why is he getting the blame? Obama's administration was the one that started to permit bump stocks be sold to the general public. #Marchforourlives
7183 2018-03-24 18:26:56 Call Rep @MarkAmodeiNV2 at 302-225-6155 or 775-686-5760 SAY: ‘I believe bump stocks should be banned, the minimum age should be raised, Congress people not already asking should get off their f-ing asses and do something about gun control.’ Maybe you'll get sent to the principal.
7184 2018-03-24 18:25:56 The Federalist Papers are not a governing document. Therefore, I don't care what it says. I care what the Constitution says. And as far as the 2nd amendment, we are maintaining a militia through our armed forces. Bump stocks are not protected under the Constitution.
7185 2018-03-24 18:25:30 Some positive movement on gun control. Assault rifles, bump stocks, age requirements certainly need our focus. But let's not allow hand guns to fall through the cracks. Most gun crime is commited w/hand guns. Handguns r still weapons of war & do not belong in civilian hands.

7187 2018-03-24 18:24:33 Banning bump stocks and thinking (or pretending) America’s gun problem is solved is like dumping a cup of water on a raging inferno. NOT NEARLY ENOUGH! Ban all assault-style weapons and high-capacity mags. Strengthen background checks. Implement gun buybacks. SAVE LIVES!
7188 2018-03-24 18:24:18 So, while there's a lot of bad ideas in this presidential administration, credit where it is due for banning bump stocks. A good first step. I don't want to make it seem like they do a lot of good things, but it's important to tell them when they actually do something right.
7189 2018-03-24 18:24:16 STOP LYING!!! #LiarInChief @BarackObama DID NOT legalize bump stocks...you are a coward!!! #MarchForOurLives
@CNBC @CNN @MSNBC @MaddowBlog @Lawrence @NBCNews
7190 2018-03-24 18:24:06 @GOPChairwoman There is so much more to this issue then guns. Why aren't there GOP speakers on the airwaves today messaging lets solve the problem by looking at guns, bump stocks, mental health, police response times, hardening schools - and expressing a comprehensive approach?
7191 2018-03-24 18:23:54 Does it say banning weapons? Or does it say bump stocks?
7192 2018-03-24 18:23:49 Fear is a stronger emotion than hope, which is why bear markets are always swifter than bull markets. The secret of making money in stocks is not to get scared out of them. Never bet on the end of the world, It only happens once. #stockmarket
7193 2018-03-24 18:23:48 Geese. The discussion room over at Breitbart is full of trump hate over banning bump stocks. WTF? Even the NRA says ban them. The line in the sand has to be drawn somewhere or these people would want automatic nuke-shooting howitzers in every home.
7194 2018-03-24 18:23:30 And this is when Anheuser-Busch stocks plummeted. Bahaha!
7195 2018-03-24 18:23:11 Bump stocks are a tool to aid in shooting rounds faster. The notion that one person can impede a God-given right of other people is contrary to the constitution and particularly the freedom our nation was founded upon.
7196 2018-03-24 18:22:39 Retail Investor follow you blindly....you always given a great call for stocks....Why not you give a call for NAMO for betterment of India....people will follow you to make right choice

7198 2018-03-24 18:22:16 Obama passed a law to allow bump stocks didn’t hear anyone complaining then and I don’t hear anyone complaining about people firing every night in Chicago
7199 2018-03-24 18:22:05 That’s true. But how will you shortlist from thousands of stocks? And how much time we should keep waiting for the price to jump. Any basic formula?
7200 2018-03-24 18:21:43 Trump hasn't taken action to ban bump stocks. He just keeps saying he will.
7201 2018-03-24 18:21:15 Let's end the sale of bump stocks and raise the age limit to 21.
7202 2018-03-24 18:19:51 $AOI closed at 25.75.  You really gotta stop getting so insane and pumping pre and post market moves on these stocks, everyone so fired up at $30 but now under 26.  Need to settle down, overly excited on a promo article in a magazine makes you really sound like a pumper.
7203 2018-03-24 18:19:24 How am I changing the subject? The subject is about the "problem" of gun violence and control. But I definitely want to know why Obama legalized bump stocks and culled the background database. This isn't consistent with addressing the problem, is it?
7204 2018-03-24 18:19:03 Trump did not put any of the current gun laws in place. Why is he getting the blame? Obama's administration was the one that started to permit bump stocks be sold to the general public. #Marchforourlives
7205 2018-03-24 18:18:55 Actually, the majority of federal gun laws would mostly affect conservative areas with mass amounts of guns and gun accessories like bump stocks, potentially disarming an armed minority of RWNJs.
7206 2018-03-24 18:18:54 GREAT AGAIN! We also condemn the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with 
clubs...
Meanwhile, that one of 1 to
7207 2018-03-24 18:18:38 What if all money left Stocks bonds went to gold and silver “cluas” this is it.
7208 2018-03-24 18:18:23 Let this sink in.  Obama made bump stocks legal.  A tool that is only good for mass shootings but is not useful for most hunting situations or for protection.  Things that make you go hmmm. #NeverAgain
7209 2018-03-24 18:18:15 The bans on magazine size or bump stocks are not gonna do much. The VA Tech shooter used a series of handguns that were preloaded.

Knife attacks can kill over a dozen ppl and have in Europe and Australia.
7210 2018-03-24 18:18:14 I'd recommend buying Facebook stocks *with* bitcoin... sure it is success for becoming rich :)
7211 2018-03-24 18:18:13 Nifty sab 8000-8500 pe sab BUY karne ko ready hai, but remember stocks bottom out in phases, some may bottom at 10000,some may not even bottom@8000 :D .so buy Value bindaas in SIP manner & watch the game with conviction in INDIA . JAI HIND !
7212 2018-03-24 18:17:48 It was the Obama administration that legalized the sale of bump stocks to the general public. Check your facts. #Marchforourlives
7213 2018-03-24 18:17:03 I just said reasonable gun control... strict background checks no bump stocks and better standards for mentally ill people to keep guns out of their hands.
7214 2018-03-24 18:16:44 @ctdemand to ban bump stocks, ghost guns, and educate ourselves about action to stem the gun violence epidemic.
7215 2018-03-24 18:16:00 Ban bump stocks Ban ghost guns.  @ForwardCT and Vote Nov. 6
7216 2018-03-24 18:16:00 True.. But bump stocks seem too help greatly during a mass murder... only a fool wouldn't want them banned. You get to choose which side of the fence you are on.
7217 2018-03-24 18:15:57 Banning bump stocks is not enough.  Ban all automatic weapons
7218 2018-03-24 18:15:50 The first responders were told to stand down. Thats the atrocity. Oh and Obama made bump stocks legal.
7219 2018-03-24 18:15:43 So...you’re pro 2nd amendment but against bump stocks? Or you like them but you hate Obama?
7220 2018-03-24 18:15:39 Bump stocks where banned as of yesterday so there’s a step
7221 2018-03-24 18:15:31 These kids have no idea what the 2 nd A is or what it means. What Exactly do they want except make a name for themselves? Florida passed a stricter gun law, and Trump just banned Bump stocks.
7222 2018-03-24 18:15:26 Killing people with bump stocks is too.
7223 2018-03-24 18:15:15 J'aime une vidéo @YouTube : "MHD fait un message au fans d'Arafat dj, les tickets en ruptures de stocks" à l'adresse
7224 2018-03-24 18:15:14 They are AGAINST background checks, they are AGAINST banning bump stocks, they are AGAINST banning citizens from having military weapons !!!
7225 2018-03-24 18:14:57 Bump stocks do not create machine guns.
7226 2018-03-24 18:14:42 Aren't bump stocks how you went bankrupt in Atlanta? No one should know better than you that bump stocks are bad. Did you learn at least?
7227 2018-03-24 18:14:40 Belt loops do the same thing bump-fire stocks do.  Levis may be going out of business soon if you wrote that too broadly.
7228 2018-03-24 18:14:36 Obama didn’t legalize bump stocks you moron.  More fake news from a fake president.  Talked to any Russians today?  How about porn stars?
7229 2018-03-24 18:14:26 Jump bc corporations was buying back stocks at a lower price
7230 2018-03-24 18:14:18 Hi. My name is Kyle. 
I own TWO rifles. I think bump stocks and semi autos are for people compensating for the fact that they can’t shoot.   
How about you learn to shoot straight? 
Then you need 1 bullet.
7231 2018-03-24 18:14:08 Sir, bridges are for crossing rivers, cars are for driving, please tell me what good purpose bump stocks serve. Tired arguments when people are dying.
7232 2018-03-24 18:13:55 What isnt said- is when using bump stocks or converting a weapon to fully auto is- they not only lose accuracy- they overheat, jam, or melt.
The Las Vegas shooter could have used the guns natural recoil when firing and he would not have had the jams he did- more deaths.
7233 2018-03-24 18:13:50 Stocks are only complicated until you learn about them. My school had teen living where we were to follow stocks, pick one and see how much money we could get. Some pay dividends. I think they should teach this in high school requirement. And basic accounting as well
7234 2018-03-24 18:13:43 AR 15 aren’t the problem. They operate as single action guns. Bump stocks make turn them into automatic weapons. To @marcorubio talking about common ground isn’t the answer. Actually coming together is the answer.
7235 2018-03-24 18:13:42 Bump stocks do not turn Semi-automatics into machine guns.  The idea is that it is a "machine" or "mechanic" that creates the action of rapid fire, when in fact it is the human's back-pressure.  Are you banning pants too?  That's a mistake, no one wants to see me in my underwear.
7236 2018-03-24 18:13:38 1 issue: gun control. Banning bumb stocks & assault weapons.  Where are the democrat politicians brave enough to ACT and declare the @NRA a terrorist organization? @SenWarren @CoryBooker @RepAdamSchiff @SenSchumer @RepJoeKennedy @TheDemCoalition @Shareblue
#MarchForOurLives
7237 2018-03-24 18:13:10 Funny while what you said about Obama us a lie you ripped up a law he put in stopping mentally ill people getting guns and you signed that in secret Obama could not make bump stocks legal as technically they have never been illegal
7238 2018-03-24 18:12:38 Bump stocks
7239 2018-03-24 18:12:36 Trump and Sessions "banning" bump stocks by fiat is just tossing a softball to NRA litigators. Congress needs to pass a bill! #MarchForOurLives
7240 2018-03-24 18:12:23 I think there’s a valid argument to be made about a minimum 21 y/o purchase age for all semi-auto weapons (pistol or rifle)— but I’m still on the fence about that. I’m not crazy about the idea of banning 30 rd mags, bump stocks are stupid,
7241 2018-03-24 18:12:14 Thanks man!! Looking forward to following you from here on! How long have you been trading in crypto/ stocks?
7242 2018-03-24 18:11:59 . The NRA knows better than to give money to us! We’re working to outlaw bump stocks, tighten background checks, and close the Armslist and gun show loophole.
7243 2018-03-24 18:11:55 Why would you possibly support bump stocks or be against anything these students support?  They have as much of a right to live as you have to play with guns.
7244 2018-03-24 18:11:33 don't forget belt loops, they can be used to do the same things as bump stocks
7245 2018-03-24 18:11:15 The kick back of a sporting rifle which Armlite rifles I considered sport believe it or not the kick back is NOT nearly as bad as shooting an old fashion rifle so I prefer that in form of semi I’m not trying to remove scope & make shot inaccurate w bump stocks lol
7246 2018-03-24 18:11:15 Why should bump stocks be banned?

7248 2018-03-24 18:11:00 I want bans on bump stocks, high capacity mags, silencers, and assault rifles. I want stiffer penalties for straw purchasers.
7249 2018-03-24 18:10:59 See i predicted 6820 exactly right when Nifty was 9000 in Feb-15. My gut feel says 8500intraday milega par kitne logg buy karenge GOD knows. so smart investors always loose 10-20% on buy-sell both ways & thats OK :) . My advice have 10-20 stocks in radar ,keep buying in SIP way
7250 2018-03-24 18:10:45 Why didnt YOU make changes you dumb A&& you were in there 8 years yet did nothing! Kinda late now to act concerned dont you think? Weren't YOU THE ONE WHO APPROVED BUMP STOCKS?
7251 2018-03-24 18:10:40 NO ONE is saying 'take the guns away."  These kids believe in the 2nd Amendment rights but they want common sense gun control.  No assault weapons, bump stocks, gun magazines, etc. Stop twisting their words and message.
7252 2018-03-24 18:10:36 Since you are following stocks and their performances I hope you must have seen amazing performance and sudden rise of wealth in opposition leaders investments after his father became CM..
7253 2018-03-24 18:10:29 Do you ever research anything before you post?  No, Obama did not legalize bump stocks.  Another lie!
7254 2018-03-24 18:10:20 I'm sorry, do you need AR-15s to button your shirt in the morning? 
Don't be hyperbolic. 

Background checks, waiting periods, no bump stocks--  that's what Americans want. But you wouldn't know it bc you're too busy patting yourself on the back for defending the NRA.
7255 2018-03-24 18:09:35 Apple is actually buying a lot of Apple stocks back! Some people think they want to be out of the public market... jut like Dell once did
7256 2018-03-24 18:09:16 Bump stocks were already considered a “gun part”. So they couldn’t were not made legal by Obama.  The admin wanted to get rid of them but the NRA and the regulating commission sai it couldn’t be done under the current law.  Congress wouldn’t change the entire law.
7257 2018-03-24 18:08:55 GUN CONTROL MEANS... stricter background checks, longer waiting periods, banning bump stocks, and high capacity magazines, metal health screenings. What it DOESN'T mean.. WE TAKE ALL YOUR GUNS! Gun control is common sense. #MarchForOurLives #GunControlNow
7258 2018-03-24 18:07:59 Ever heard of the NFA? Machine guns are legal, just very strictly regulated. Bump stocks should be put under that.
7259 2018-03-24 18:07:45 You can't and you can build one cheaper than buy one 
But if the language wasn't changed bump stocks are not all that's going to be banned not that it will matter but none the less
7260 2018-03-24 18:07:22 I need to express deepest gratitude for #MarchForOurLives students’ eloquence, intelligence, common sense sanity, power in speaking out against arming teachers.

Those who’ve been there know this would be like putting bump stocks on school shootings.
7261 2018-03-24 18:07:11 "[Trump] has promised that the Department of Justice will issue a ruling banning bump stocks" -@MargeryEagan
7262 2018-03-24 18:07:06 I disagree srry.Thats wat makes a market. It has declined alot but during a major market dip. All stocks r down. Comm Stocks tend to b more volatile and it had to shakeout all the Jonny come latelys for tariffs. This was up over100% in 18months! It can dip more but LT trend is up
7263 2018-03-24 18:07:05 Banning bump stocks does not equal gun control. What is the big deal with people and the banning of bump stocks? Banning them does not infringe on ones second amendment rights.
7264 2018-03-24 18:05:55 Nice info on it!!  $AYTU was given to my subscribing clients @ .41-.42 entry on 3/14, which is up as much as 21-24% from entry so far as of latest 3/23 close.
7265 2018-03-24 18:05:38 Good move, we just need to see it actually hapenning. And it was Paul Rayan and other folks that did not let ban bump stocks after Las Vagas massacre. Shame on them
7266 2018-03-24 18:05:35 Big shit ! That should have been done years ago! Just like his crumbs to the people w/ his 1.5 trillion dollar tax cut, bump stocks are zip! Universal background, banning all semi automatic military weapons! Limited ammo rounds purchased! That’s a start !
7267 2018-03-24 18:05:28 The 2nd amendment should be repealed and replaced. High capacity magazines, AR 15 types of weapons, bump stocks, no limits on ammo and/or firearms etc. are all realities that the Founders could never have envisioned. 
#AssaultWeaponsBan
7268 2018-03-24 18:05:13 Oh que oui. On est en période de montée en stock pour sécuriser la saison. Si y'a un très belle été, ce sera génial pour PepsiCo mais il y a des risques de saturation sur certains entrepôts assez vite quand les sorties de stocks sont importantes
7269 2018-03-24 18:05:03 Oh Marcy ,  we do want their guns - their assault rifles, their bump stocks, their high cap mags, their armor piercing ammo, etc.   we want this very much.
7270 2018-03-24 18:04:53 Bump stocks should be illegal but that isn’t what the end goal of the left is. They want flat out bans.
7271 2018-03-24 18:04:39 Watching the #MarchForOurLives» While I am a believer in the 2nd amendment I don't understand why #USCongress can't do the following:  
 No Gun Show Loophole
 Thorough background checks including Psych tests
 No bump stocks
 Limit all magazines to 10 bullets or less
7272 2018-03-24 18:04:22 
7273 2018-03-24 18:04:20 @realDonaldTrump See, asshole, there you go LYING again. Had you done something useful, like, read, you’d know that Obama administration could NOT outlaw bump stocks because they weren’t regulated by gun laws. They DID outlaw  Akins Accelerator and Autoglove  because they WERE...
7274 2018-03-24 18:03:48 Honestly for the black community to take a stand and fight for what we want we have to all become invested in the US even tho we don’t want to. 

That means getting a higher percentage of blacks invested in stocks, owning more businesses, having these higher positions and more!
7275 2018-03-24 18:03:47 Trump did not put any of the current gun laws in place. Why is he getting the blame? Obama's administration was the one that started to permit bump stocks be sold to the general public. #Marchforourlives
7276 2018-03-24 18:03:35 Please listen to these kids, teachers, and parents today! Here is your chance to do something good for our country! If you don't you will prove that you don't care, it's not about arming teachers and banning bump stocks. Act like a President and listen.
7277 2018-03-24 18:03:22 I personally don't think it's a gun issue. Granted, I agree there's not a need for bump stocks, or the general public to have an AR15. I'm also for extensive background checks. I don't think that'll stop it. I believe its a moral issue, lack of valuing human life in some people.
7278 2018-03-24 18:03:07 Universal background checks, 21 years old to by a gun, banning bump stocks, and banning assault style weapons. Mental illness, duh, people in that category should not be allowed to own guns. Debate is healthy and should continue.

7281 2018-03-24 18:01:59 Isn’t job of FM is to remain fully invested? If valuation is the key, isn’t low valued stocks available in highly valued market also & FM should be able to identify such stocks? investors pay high cost for that skill, right? Else investors can just index. 

Genuinely asking.
7282 2018-03-24 18:01:51 I'm curious, besides the rate of fire, what are the differences, effective firing range, scope availability, length of barrels, ammo, stocks, weight?
7283 2018-03-24 18:01:48 Common ground:
1. Expand background checks
2. Eliminate gun show loopholes
3. Ban manufacture, sale, ownership of bump stocks
4. Make straw purchases a federal crime + 20 yrs penalty
5. Fines for owners if legal gun used in a crime was not stored in a gun safe

Do something Rubio
7284 2018-03-24 18:01:41 Trump did not put any of the current gun laws in place. Why is he getting the blame? Obama's administration was the one that started to permit bump stocks be sold to the general public. #Marchforourlives
7285 2018-03-24 18:01:15 Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns. by #sweetatertot2
7286 2018-03-24 18:00:05 Not only should bump-stocks be banned, but the ATF should subpoena lists from the dealers of the all goobers and freaks who have ordered them, and put each and every one of their Form 4473s under a microscope.
7287 2018-03-24 17:58:46 He’s only interested in people he can con. Thinks bump stocks are enough to quell the rage. Not. These kids are the superior to him because they truly want to make America great.
7288 2018-03-24 17:57:55 You’re acting like people don’t look the other way to make a profit. The Vegas shooter purchased dozens of guns on the same day, including ammo and bump stocks. Completely legally. That isn’t right.
7289 2018-03-24 17:57:24 Right, so how did the young man walk into a gun shop and legally purchase the AR-15? Trump has not banned bump stocks, he said he would. I am sure he will again balk at that when the NRA greases his little palms yet again.
7290 2018-03-24 17:56:56 None. Their arming up with their AR-15s and their bump stocks and everything else the gun nuts worship.
7291 2018-03-24 17:56:46 “What Gov Ducey has announced will not keep our children safe. Bump stocks must be banned. High capacity magazines must be banned. Assault style weapons must be banned.” #AssaultWeaponsBan #MarchForOurLivesPHX
7292 2018-03-24 17:56:40 *The collapse of the capelin stocks, perhaps due in large part to seismic blasting and anti-seal hunting campaigns that you buckle under.
7293 2018-03-24 17:56:11 Your thoughts and prayers don’t cut it. They are worthless. 2nd Amendment does not give a right to assault weapons. BAN them along with high capacity magazines and bump stocks. Nothing less counts.  more @nytimes
7294 2018-03-24 17:56:04 This is not true Anna. The President just banned bump stocks. It is more complex. Securing the boarder is step 1.
7295 2018-03-24 17:55:56 Bump stocks might have been the only freedom Obama did give the American people, not that it was a great thing one way or another. But in ONE DAY you signed off on this ban and signed off on the most expensive budget for a 6 mo. period in history. Shameful #1TermTrump Dems own U!
7296 2018-03-24 17:55:21 Monday is huge. Apple would take the biggest hit if trade war would happen. 20% of their total sales are from China. #AAPL #Stocks #Nasdaq
7297 2018-03-24 17:54:53 Yes to background checks, common sense changes, ban military weapons for civilians, ban bump stocks, protect our kids!!!!!!!!
7298 2018-03-24 17:54:53 At the end of the day, you can’t control evil. That man was an evil Sociopath. Our founding fathers decreed our right to bear arms (responsibly). Bump stocks, gone, machine guns need to go, unless you are law enforcement. Need better vetting processes on state level to obtain.
7299 2018-03-24 17:54:15 There’s no civilian use for assault rifles… high-capacity magazines… armor piercing bullets... bump-stocks… their purpose is killing as many “People” (not animals) as possible, as quickly as possible… there is no civilian use for any of them… we’ve seen the deaths already…
7300 2018-03-24 17:53:43 Yet another of your LIES. The Obama administration didn't legalize bump stocks. 

Obama issued EOs creating stricter controls,( all of which YOU rolled back by the way), but could not legally restrict (non mechanical) bump stocks without new laws. Congress refused.
7301 2018-03-24 17:53:41 I hope so, but all my oil relates stocks getting stuck in this sell off
7302 2018-03-24 17:53:20 Don’t pretend like there aren’t loopholes and lax rules at gun shows or purchases online. Don’t also pretend like it’s normal for someone to be able to purchase dozens of guns on the same day, with bump stocks in order to shoot 500 people in mere minutes outside a hotel window.
7303 2018-03-24 17:52:56 Trump banned bump stocks yesterday. 

Military weapons are already banned since the 1930s. 

Your being played by the left and talking points that are false.
7304 2018-03-24 17:52:40 Banning bump stocks is like doing nothing.  NRA must have approved that nothing move.  Can you hear them now!!!  You’ve failed, this issue was your defining moment and once again you’re all about NRA money.  Step aside. So these young Americans can Make America Great!!
7305 2018-03-24 17:52:39 This is NEWS??? We have kids marching (Celebrity Funded Movement)against the @NRA but using ARMED GUARD FOR PROTECTION!

7306 2018-03-24 17:52:17 The lie is that he legalized bump stocks. But aside from yet another lie, banning bump stocks is a good idea. More can/will be done. He also left you with a thriving economy that your Trade War is sending into a death spiral. The 2018 Referendum has begun.
7307 2018-03-24 17:51:59 The POTUS just passed a bill yesterday on stricter gun laws by banning bump stocks . What a sad day when the left use children for their 2nd gun grab agenda .
7308 2018-03-24 17:51:45 People can 3d print bump stocks. So  now what?

Bump stocks is a start but hardly enough (crumbs!). The kids are pushing for the real thing, no more military assault rifles on our streets.

7319 2018-03-24 17:48:34 Hey David, who allowed bump stocks? Who is ending it?
7320 2018-03-24 17:48:18 The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives ruled in 2010 that bump stocks were not a firearm subject to regulation and allowed their sale as an unregulated firearm part. The ATF does not track production, so no one knows how many are in circulation.[4][7]
7321 2018-03-24 17:48:13 @Marketsmojo is there a way to find the list of stocks in a particular category, like all the stocks with valuation=very attractive, something like this. I'm not able find any option like that.
7322 2018-03-24 17:47:25 Mga naguubos ng stocks a yan no? Haha. Wala bang coffee press ne bnebenta rin sa inyo?
7323 2018-03-24 17:46:45 Dear @NRA: An entire generation is telling you to go to hell. How does that feel?

You do not represent gun owners, who SUPPORT background checks, restrictions on assault weapons and bump stocks, and better, more controlled registration.

You do NOT represent America.

Get lost.
7324 2018-03-24 17:46:28 Our President banned the sale of bump stocks. He’s also called on the individual states to take action. He has not pleaded ignorance on this subject and shouldn’t be used as political pawn when he HAS taken action.
7325 2018-03-24 17:46:20 I hope you at least agree that bump stocks and high capacity magazines should be illegal, right?
7326 2018-03-24 17:46:05 #GunControlNow we need more accurate shooters and much better gun control. Much more training is needed to fire accurately. Bump Stocks only make a gun inaccurate and then there is no gun control.
7327 2018-03-24 17:45:22 No one is bashing the 2nd amendment, they are asking for thoughtful, intelligent bans on military type weapons, bump stocks and raising the age of those wanting to purchase guns. Wake up and listen!
7328 2018-03-24 17:45:21 Because the “mentally ill” part is what no one reeeally wants to address. They’d rather talk bump stocks and AR-15’s and all the things that don’t matter.
7329 2018-03-24 17:45:20 Now that fix NICS, the School Safety bill, and the ban on bump stocks are law, these kids deserve a celebration lap . . . a job well done!

7332 2018-03-24 17:44:44 Obama Administration required all automatic rifles in US have bump stocks. BAD IDEA. If he hadn't, Las Vegas and so many other mass killings would NEVER have happened. As I promised, we will BAN all devices the @NRA tells me are OK to ban that don't stop their campaign donations.
7333 2018-03-24 17:43:57 Bump stocks do not turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.
7334 2018-03-24 17:43:46 Thank you for asking! Ban bump stocks, demand stricter universal background checks, and make the gun show loophole illegal are just a few of the many ways we can lessen gun violence, and begin to make change. Unfortunately, there’s no easy solution. And it starts with the vote!
7335 2018-03-24 17:43:45 These decisions allowed two companies to sell bump stocks. It’s important to note this was not a statement of Obama’s preferred policy, which called for more regulation of guns, but was what the agency determined it had to do under the language of current law.
7336 2018-03-24 17:43:41 We indeed found two occasions in which ATF, a bureau within the executive branch, decided it could not regulate bump stocks during the Obama administration.
7337 2018-03-24 17:43:35 1. You can invest in stocks, options, real estate, investest in bonds, sell clothes on eBay, you become real estate salesman, you sell cars, you can trade and invest currency, you open up a weed store in states where it’s legal etc
7338 2018-03-24 17:43:09 im in massachusettes.. we banded bump stocks... safer up here...only 3.5  per 100,000  deaths with smart gun laws. abuse ,alot of crimes ,restrainning order.. can get your guns taken away quick..I know a friend who didnt register hes dads collection..HE LOST THE GUNS, grew poppys
7339 2018-03-24 17:42:34 Well Obama didn’t sign into law the Fix NICS act that tightens background checks for gun buyers, or STOP School Violence Act that provides for stronger school security. He didn’t ban bump stocks either, but Trump did  do these things! Of course the left won’t talk about that
7340 2018-03-24 17:42:21 Well banning bump stocks is a start. It's small and we need a lot more things to be worked but it's a start.
7341 2018-03-24 17:41:49 Hump stocks?  Sounds sexy...tell me more.
7342 2018-03-24 17:41:36 The fact that utilities also fell hard last week despite stocks plunge, and even more than basic materials, raises risks levels even for 60/40 investors. #stocks #bonds $SPY $TLT
7343 2018-03-24 17:41:26 YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT. This is not about bump stocks, its about creating regulations to be interpreted in such a way that the left and the Deep State can take away ALL semi-automatic rifles and pistols. THAT'S THE PLAN! WAKE UP! @DonaldJTrumpJr
7344 2018-03-24 17:41:26 Because that would only partly solve part of the problem. Some people should never ever have access to an AR-15 with or without bump stocks. We don’t want to ban all guns everywhere. Just the worst of them, and regulate that violent sociopaths can’t have any guns.
7345 2018-03-24 17:41:05 Hump stocks...???
7346 2018-03-24 17:40:59 #MarchForOurLives Check out murder statistics. Hammers responsible 4 more murders than bump stocks. Murder is illegal. Laws don't stop immorality & murder.

7349 2018-03-24 17:40:45 Trump did not put any of the current gun laws in place. Why is he getting the blame? Obama's administration was the one that started to permit bump stocks be sold to the general public. #Marchforourlives
7350 2018-03-24 17:40:40 AR doesn’t stand for assault rifle, it’s a scary looking gun, I’ll give you that, but it only fires one at a time just like a hand gun. By POTUS banning bump stocks yesterday, you can no longer make it an illegal semi automatic weapon. That’s as far as the right is willing to go
7351 2018-03-24 17:40:32 @POTUS You can't change a semi-auto to an automatic with a device that requires a pull of the trigger for each round. Not possible. And banning bump stocks and other similar devices puts Americans out of business. Changing the lives of many because of the action of one.

7354 2018-03-24 17:40:11 There you go again with the comedy!  Obama didn't 'legalize' bump stocks.  What ever isn't ILLEGAL is legal @realDonaldTrump. But thanks for making them illegal nevertheless. Now let's do that for the AR-15 -- make them illegal too.
7355 2018-03-24 17:40:03 Well speaking of common sense legislation, your uber Nazi white supremacist fascist homophobic islamophobic transphobic racist orange can’t-wait-until-he’s-dead president just banned bump stocks.

7361 2018-03-24 17:39:22 @TheDemCoalition bump stocks aren’t firearms and therefore can’t be regulated unless CONGRESS steps in.
7362 2018-03-24 17:39:20 Obama had more days off than Santa Claus , you are picking up his slack. Great job against Bump stocks. Great ideas for making schools safe again. Gun free zones kill students and UNARMED teachers. Will America wake up before it grows old . You are blowing Reveille. MAGA
7363 2018-03-24 17:39:14 First of all, this is a lie. Secondly, what the hell are hump stocks? 
7364 2018-03-24 17:39:04 Another lie. The Obama administration did not legalize bump stocks. Someone do a second's worth of research, please. Donald's counting on his base to accept his word, which is more often a lie than the truth.  Let's stop spreading misinformation and lies.
7365 2018-03-24 17:39:02 And on the sixth day God said, "Let there be bump stocks on AR-15s so thou shalt blow the head off of serpents and locust."
7366 2018-03-24 17:38:49 Show me in the Bible where it says God gave you the right to own an AR-15 with bump stocks.  The day you find that will probably be the same day you also finally pay child support.

7370 2018-03-24 17:36:53 Everyone feel safer now that there have been protests? Anyone believe than banning bump stocks, raising the legal age to buy firearms, or banning AR-15's definitely puts an end to mass killings?

7376 2018-03-24 17:35:35 Do you truly believe that's the solution to gun violence is to band Bump Stocks is your answer ? You stated yesterday you would never sign a bill that you hadn't read is that true also ? I'm just asking.....
7377 2018-03-24 17:35:26 Guns don't kill, ppl do. All my guns haven't killed anyone in over 40 years. These kids haven't a clue about responsible gun ownership & changing the age or banning bump stocks won't do a damn thing look at the kid in Austin who decided to use a bomb instead..Evil will find a way
7378 2018-03-24 17:34:59 I think I'll take a "wait and see" approach to this one.  He also promised never to fund PP, and too support the 2nd amendment.  Now he wants to ban bump stocks.  What's next?  High capacity clips?  Oh well, who needs em anyways?

Honestly, I hope you're right.  He needs a win.
7379 2018-03-24 17:34:55 ...1 by publicly disagreeing with the NRA- he told us how to pursue assault weapon restrictions [Bernie Sanders repeatedly voted against restrictions.].
Secondly, Bum stocks are done… 
3rd Obama had the “non Fake News” media on his lap…he has no memorable quotes on guns
7380 2018-03-24 17:34:38 So very sad that our kids have to experience gun violence...  We should not have to accept this...   BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS, BAN BUMP STOCKS, UNIVERSAL RECORDS OF GUN OWNERS...
7381 2018-03-24 17:34:30 Dude, assault weapons are already banned. Do a fraction of research before you regurgitate talking points from the news. AR-15’s are not assault weapons and trump literally just banned bull stocks last night.
7382 2018-03-24 17:34:25 Do u think any of them know about the ban on bump stocks or the new bill passed? This would actually be a great learning project for the kids to read the bill and understand bump stocks. They could even research how many media outlets have informed the public on this.

7388 2018-03-24 17:32:26 OBAMA DID NOT LEGALISE BUMP STOCKS YOU LIAR. Yes, all in caps!
7389 2018-03-24 17:32:22 Ik vind wel dat Trump iets mag doen aan de aanvalswapens en de bump-stocks. En verder inzetten op OPVOEDING en beveiliging van scholen. Iemand die schiet in een school verspeelt zijn meest fundamentele rechten: afknallen!
7390 2018-03-24 17:32:12 @foxnewsradio Bump stocks do not turn a gun into a machine gun as you reported on a hourly news cast. Thought you guys were better than that
7391 2018-03-24 17:32:04 These other dads at dance are talking about stocks and I’m sitting here hungover with my D.A.R.T.Y. shirt on. @KFCBarstool @UncleChaps @TheClemReport @PodfathersShow
7392 2018-03-24 17:31:29 Haha well the anime came out in 2006 I think so it's an oldie. Not sure how Netflix stocks up on old stuff.
7393 2018-03-24 17:31:18 With a land value tax, land becomes a sovereign wealth fund. If you really want gov to own foreign stocks, you can just do as Swiss do and print currency to buy FAANG.
7394 2018-03-24 17:31:14 This is not the fault of our president. People kill, not guns. President has now banned the sale a bump stocks, which was a step in the right direction. Multiple officials were warned about this dangerous man and did not give any attention to it.
7395 2018-03-24 17:30:56 THIS A LIE, OBAMA DID NOT LEGALIZE BUMP STOCKS. OBA)MA ISSUE EOs CREATING STRICTER CONTROLS (ALL OF WHICH TRUMP HAS ROLLED BACK) BUT COULD NOT LEGALLY RESTRICT (NON MECHANICAL) BUMPS STOCK WITHOUT NEW LAWS, CONGRESS REFUSED. #IMPEACHTHISSHITHOLEPRESIDENT
7396 2018-03-24 17:30:43 @NRA Domestic protection and hunting do not require assault rifles. We don’t need bump stocks or silencers to defend our home or hunt. Earplugs will suffice. Assault rifles turn targets to hamburger w hunting. GET REAL OR KILL GOP AND USA.
7397 2018-03-24 17:30:35 The embryotony scissors is responsible for more death than bump stocks. Sickening what this weapon can do.  #banthescissor
7398 2018-03-24 17:30:11 Note to 2016 self: invest in poster paper stocks.
7399 2018-03-24 17:30:07 was it not the Obama administration who legalized Bump Stocks?????
7400 2018-03-24 17:29:47 THIS A LIE, OBAMA DID NOT LEGALIZE BUMP STOCKS. OBA)MA ISSUE EOs CREATING STRICTER CONTROLS (ALL OF WHICH TRUMP HAS ROLLED BACK) BUT COULD NOT LEGALLY RESTRICT (NON MECHANICAL) BUMPS STOCK WITHOUT NEW LAWS, CONGRESS REFUSED. #IMPEACHTHISSHITHOLEPRESIDENT 
7401 2018-03-24 17:29:28 21, seriously?  How about 25 when the brain is fully developed. Let’s just eliminate bump stocks & semiautomatic weapons, with the exception of swat teams & the like.  Good luck Prez
7402 2018-03-24 17:29:20 What do they want at #MarchForOurLives ?

Already Passed STOP
Already Passed NICS
Banned Bump Stocks
Multiple Florida Laws changed
Omnibus included background check loopholes

Let’s be real, they say it’s not about undermining #2A but it sure looks like it is.
7403 2018-03-24 17:29:19 Obama legalized bump stocks which the Vegas shooter used thanks bud
7404 2018-03-24 17:29:13 what capcity clip/magazine do you think should be the maximum allowed for a civilian? what maximum # shots per 60 sec is necessary for home defense?
what about armor piercing bullets?
what about bump stocks?
7405 2018-03-24 17:28:53 Technically speaking, civilian AR rifles are less lethal than military M-4's, being limited to semi-auto only (unless they add **** like bump stocks)
7406 2018-03-24 17:28:53 THIS A LIE, OBAMA DID NOT LEGALIZE BUMP STOCKS. OBA)MA ISSUE EOs CREATING STRICTER CONTROLS (ALL OF WHICH TRUMP HAS ROLLED BACK) BUT COULD NOT LEGALLY RESTRICT (NON MECHANICAL) BUMPS STOCK WITHOUT NEW LAWS, CONGRESS REFUSED. #IMPEACHTHISSHITHOLEPRESIDENT 
7407 2018-03-24 17:28:45 Do u think any of them know about ban if bump stocks and new bill to fight gun violence?
7408 2018-03-24 17:28:45 The time. But it wasn’t a matter of him approving them. Bump stocks weren’t regulated.
7409 2018-03-24 17:28:26 No you are wrong. They want assualt guns & bump stocks banned
7410 2018-03-24 17:28:24 He literally went from Obama wants to take away all guns (nevermind that didnt happen during his presidency) to Obama legalized bump stocks lol
7411 2018-03-24 17:28:17 So one of the speakers at the gun control rally said, “Give is an inch, and we’ll take a mile.  Ban bump stocks and we’ll ban assault weapons.”  Congratulations, you just 1) accidentally told the truth, and 2) put in jeopardy one issue both sides could agree on.
7412 2018-03-24 17:27:52 Do u think any of them know about ban of bump stocks and new bill passed?
7413 2018-03-24 17:27:35 Alabama VA big November warning for #GOP and #Trump 
All Tax cuts Stocks China etc doesn’t count 
People want justice #CroockedHillary and Comey FBI in jail No Daca and the #wall
7414 2018-03-24 17:26:54 It’s a weapon designed for killing people & the bump stocks turn them into basically full auto weapons. Regardless of what Little Marco Rubio says, no hunters need high capacity magazines.
7415 2018-03-24 17:26:48 I've seen bump stocks at gun shows for 20 years, quit changing the subject from that "ridiculous" bill you just signed.  I voted for you, but I'm pissed.  Pass a tax cut, then increase our debt by 1.3 trillion bucks. WTF????
7416 2018-03-24 17:26:44 How about KEEPING the bump stocks and mandating an AUTOMATIC FEDERAL DEATH PENALTY for anyone using said bump stocks on innocent humans.
7417 2018-03-24 17:26:19 So Obama simultaneously plotted to take everyone’s guns away while legalizing bump stocks?

Tax exempt NRA has blood on it's hands & soaking thru it's existence.
It's time for change! 
Ban: 
Assault weapons
Bump stocks
High capacity magazines
+ Universal background checks
+ Registration & Insurance
7419 2018-03-24 17:26:09 Abid SherAli is very right.Political instability and havoc created by PTI is the main source of economic crisis in Pakistan. Stocks market crash, devaluation of currency , lack of investors confidence are all aftermaths of political crises. Who is responsible ? off course Imran!
7420 2018-03-24 17:26:07 @CNN Please tell Allison to stop acting like the little changes with the bump stocks is such a big deal. No where in the world are there more people killed than in America. Why because of the gun laws!!!!!!! Enough already how many more have to die each year.
7421 2018-03-24 17:25:15 Bump stocks do not turn any gun into a machine gun.
7422 2018-03-24 17:24:59 In the past 24 hours #StopSchoolViolenceAct and #FixNICS passed and bump stocks have been banned. And they continue to march. You know why? Because it wont be enough for them until they ban every gun. Dont be tricked. #MarchForOurLives #GunControlNow #EnoughIsEnough.
7423 2018-03-24 17:24:56 Instead of an assault weapons ban I would much prefer a ban on magazines that hold more than 7 rounds of ammunition, banning bump stocks, closing the gun show loophole, and implementing a more advanced background check system.
7424 2018-03-24 17:24:47 Thanks v much. I am a strong believer in idea value btc develops in a non-lineair way, different concepts compared to how to value sovereign currencies, or stocks for that matter. Of course price is always demand/supply determined.
7425 2018-03-24 17:24:30 @CNN -TELL THAT former-fox IDIOT allison camerotta to STOP talking about "bump stocks" as if it means ANY real change has happened under tRUmp!!! He HAS done nothing and he WILL do nothing!!! I'm SICK of her fondling him ON AIR!!!!
7426 2018-03-24 17:24:27 I sincerely hope this actually comes to pass.  The NRA even has stated they believe bump stocks are subject to further regulation.  However your first sentence doesn't represent the full truth.
7427 2018-03-24 17:24:27 People are wondering if #LitTube blog needs a #stocks related article.  I might have to give it to them!
7428 2018-03-24 17:24:14 Gold is seen heading higher. Stocks should correct again on Monday. Expect banks to continue to bleed in Dalal street
7429 2018-03-24 17:24:08 @NRA RESPECTFULLY, If you don’t voluntarily stop assault weapons and bump stocks and silencers, you will kill the Rep. party. We are PROLIFE! But, you are making us PRODEATH! Some GOP will cross over on this topic! Are you so foolish for power! Weapons weren’t like this in 1800’s
7430 2018-03-24 17:23:57 LIES.

We do NOT have MANDATORY background checks for ALL sales.

Bump stocks DO more than a fast finger.

Are you stupid, or just spouting propaganda?

(Hint: There is no "None of the above" choice.)

"Next..."
7431 2018-03-24 17:23:53 Democrats own guns too

Trump wants to raise the age to buy a gun to 21, ban bump stocks and deal with mental illness...will he vote for him???

7433 2018-03-24 17:23:15 Banning bump stocks will linger under lawsuits for years, thus amounting to Nothing. What about stronger background checks? Oh yeah, NRA doesn’t like that!#conman.
7434 2018-03-24 17:23:15 How about a clean DACA Bill?
Maybe a bill to ban bump stocks.
How about a bill to protect the Mueller investigation?
How about real tax relief for the middle class?
Those are all things the Dems will get behind.
7435 2018-03-24 17:23:12 ok, this is something being fed to them. Trump stepped up when this shooting occurred. Bump stocks, because of Pres. are banned. A fix by congress for background checks already in place. So our job now is to stop teachers/professors/colleges/high schools from brainwashing kids
7436 2018-03-24 17:22:48 When were bump stocks illegal?
7437 2018-03-24 17:22:48 Bump Stocks I saw didn't fire like a machine gun. They say rate is 600rpm I say 300rpm more accurate, even less - not that much faster than you can fire by hand on a good automatic. The real need in gun control is to ban ALL automatics or revolvers that can shoot more than 60rpm
7438 2018-03-24 17:22:46 Why is @realDonaldTrump getting blamed for the gun violence in this country. He has never been a politician prior to a year ago. Place the blame where it belongs, on all previous administrations. Begin with Obama who legalized bump stocks.  #Marchforourlives
7439 2018-03-24 17:21:59 He mentions only a few of the policies that could be enacted. What about licensure?  What about universal background checks?  What about Orders of Protection that include gun confiscation?  What about bump stocks?  Leaving these out shows he’s not serious.
7440 2018-03-24 17:21:44 U r wrong! They want better gun control.  Everyday ppl don’t need a weapon of war/bump stocks. We need better background checks 2make sure guns don’t get n2 t/wrong hands - criminals&mentally ill. There needs 2b age limits-21. 2bad U can’t handle t/truth
7441 2018-03-24 17:21:38 78% of adult Americans DON'T own guns. The majority of gun owners agree that common sense gun laws are necessary.  NO ONE is saying ban guns - they are saying ban assault rifles, ban bump stocks, create better background checks & require at least 3 day waiting periods EVERYWHERE.
7442 2018-03-24 17:21:30 We do, and then we let people own bump stocks. Crazy right!? Lol
7443 2018-03-24 17:21:22 Or it could be some good ol' boys playing with their new bump stocks. Hard to tell the difference these days...
7444 2018-03-24 17:21:13 Thought sessions is going to do a ban on bump stocks to stop ppl from getting these guns illegally?  This should be our biggest concern.
7445 2018-03-24 17:21:05 Trump did not put any of the current gun laws in place. Why is he getting the blame? Obama's administration was the one that started to permit bump stocks be sold to the general public. #Marchforourlives
7446 2018-03-24 17:21:02 I am mainly doing trend following, but its not working lately. I took few positions on Friday, if i get stopped on those, i will hold on trend following stocks till vix goes below 20. Vix is my enemy now. But i hear this market environment is perfect day trading. So i may try it
7447 2018-03-24 17:20:50 Lots of teachers are already armed

Trump wants to raise the age to buy guns to 21 and ban bump stocks. Where is your praise for him???
7448 2018-03-24 17:20:48 Hell even the president is pushing to do that and ban bump stocks when you can still make a homemade bump stock.
7449 2018-03-24 17:20:23 There’s no civilian use for assault rifles… high-capacity magazines… armor piercing bullets... bump-stocks… their purpose is killing as many “People” (not animals) as possible, as quickly as possible… there is no civilian use for any of them… we’ve seen the deaths already…
7450 2018-03-24 17:20:16 @Stonekettle: The Obama administration didn't legalize bump stocks. Obama issued EOs creating stricter controls (all of which Trump has rolled back), but could not legally restrict (non mechanical) bump stocks without new laws. Congress refused.
7451 2018-03-24 17:20:10 We have background checks. Wife beaters can't legally buy a gun. Bump stocks do nothing that a fast trigger finger doesn't do. AR-15 is not a military weapon. 

Next....
7452 2018-03-24 17:20:00 You been slagging dope since the 90's. It's time to upgrade now. I teach dope niggas how to trade real stocks time to put the scale down. Less risks more millions. Strictly dope boys

7455 2018-03-24 17:19:38 I will let the form open until there is no more stocks. But GO has deadline(4/2).
7456 2018-03-24 17:18:57 Meanwhile, the world is watching and wondering why it's necessary for millions of Americans to take to the streets to get their govt to do ANYTHING meaningful about these terrible massacres. Banning bump stocks and raising the age to purchase a gun is NOT meaningful.
7457 2018-03-24 17:18:55 Bump stocks should have been banned a long time ago
7458 2018-03-24 17:18:47 Stocks: RUT, NASDAQ closed on the low on 3-23. SP500, DJUA, DJTA, DJIA closed barely above the lows. Bearish sign? It is very likely that huge sell on 3-23 which they tried to reverse several times will continue. Au,Ag perked up nicely. Pt, Pd stayed about unchanged. Will see?
7459 2018-03-24 17:18:31 Common ground is keeping your handguns and shotguns and getting rid of the assault rifles, high-capacity mags and bump stocks.

7461 2018-03-24 17:18:04 There were so many people who never knew what a bump stock was. Now since all the advertising they got from the media the bump stocks became a popular item to purchase!
7462 2018-03-24 17:17:51 Obama administration did NOT legalize bump stocks! Stop lying!

7464 2018-03-24 17:16:56 Dear mr. president, bumpstocks do not turn firearms into illegal machine guns. Bump stocks enables the user to fire more quickly. I think they are a waste of money. Educate yourself and others about what these devices actually do PLEASE.
7465 2018-03-24 17:16:46 @HouseGOP @SpeakerRyan @senategop fake @POTUS @realDonaldTrump will do nothing but continue to pander to the @NRA BANNING BUMP STOCKS IS NOT ENOUGH

where variables are stocks bonds currency gold .etc. itsconnected .dollor will turn when its time .may be it has made a bottom  but priceis price .people willalways be momentum .key is how low or highitcango
7467 2018-03-24 17:16:12 Reduce access to weapons through universal background checks, an assault weapon ban in general, banning bump stocks, establishing waiting periods, +it'd be nice for the country to also have a conversation about mental health & domestic violence, which are linked to gun violence.
7468 2018-03-24 17:15:44 @realDonaldTrump I know how hard this is for you, but try opening your mouth just once without lying. Barack Obama did NOT legalize bump stocks, and you should know that. Every time you try to sell a piece of bs like that you embarrass yourself and the nation.
7469 2018-03-24 17:15:13 Bump stocks R not enough. If U are 2 dumb to know that, get the h*** out of office. Your time is running out, either do the right thing or U can start cleaning out your office, we've had ENOUGH of children being mowed down with AR-15 assault rifles while U collect your NRA fees!
7470 2018-03-24 17:14:52 BUMP STOCKS NOT the PROBLEM, BUT 1.3 TRILLION DOLLAR PORK IS
7471 2018-03-24 17:14:51 I am a hunter and gun owner who supports #MarchForOurLives. I also support: universal background checks with no loopholes, banning bump stocks, requiring a trigger lock to be sold with every firearm, and restricting assault weapons.
7472 2018-03-24 17:14:45 You keep eroding 2a,,,it's coming to American soil soon. Good citizens are being systematically neutered,  big mistake yesterday ON Bump Stocks,,you threw us under the oil slick slope now. Huge political mistake.!Mistake,criminals love this gun oil slick, they won't be complying!
7473 2018-03-24 17:14:43 Stop Gun Violence by banning the Left from owning a Gun. From what we see they are the killers now a days. #2 raid the Muslim Mosque basements and seize their stocks of Weapon Caches.
7474 2018-03-24 17:14:29 Anyone else concerned about the recent stock numbers. I think we should push for legislation that would allow us to withdraw our money without the 10% penalty. If stocks are going to have poor returns we need to be able to put it to work somewhere else.
7475 2018-03-24 17:14:04 No but I support reintroducing mandatory safety classes, banning bump stocks, mandating trigger locks and raising the age for purchasing long guns to 21. That and regulating the deep web to ban the sale of illegal content.
7476 2018-03-24 17:13:57 Def going to consider $DROP and $LLEX - both seem like sleeping giants for stock. #stocks #pennystocks #daytrading #nyse #nasdaq
7477 2018-03-24 17:13:26 IF every shooting happened in school, arming teachers MIGHT help. What about movie theaters, malls, sidewalks? There is NO good reason to sell massive amounts of ammo or automatic assault riffles to the public & gun collectors don’t need bump stocks. How much is a life worth?

7481 2018-03-24 17:12:59 Banning bump stocks is not enough. This country needs protection from terrorist groups like the NRA. NO assault weapons whatsoever would be better, as well as very tough gun laws. PS, President Obama DID NOT LEGALIZE BUMP STOCKS! Quit trying to smear him. A better POTUS than you.
7482 2018-03-24 17:12:33 Since the terrible shooting in Parkland, Florida, @realDonaldTrump has signed into law Fix NICS Act that tightens background checks for gun buyers and STOP School Violence Act that provides for stronger security for schools. @realDonaldTrump admin has also banned bump stocks.
7483 2018-03-24 17:11:55 First amendment is the cornerstone of America.  The second amendment ensures we continue to have free speech against a tyrannical government.  Take the guns away and we have no way to defend against a tyrannical government.  Background checks...of course..... bump stocks...sure
7484 2018-03-24 17:11:53 Oh, that's funny. 

What about if you're trying to get away or hiding?  There's a better chance of getting away if you don't have an assault rifle aimed at you!  

Are you ok with banning assault rifles and bump stocks?  
7485 2018-03-24 17:11:30 Stocks are way below all time high now
7486 2018-03-24 17:10:54 Don’t own any individual tech stocks, lagged the market last year but not feeing as much pain on the way down...but need to unload some lazy dividend aristocrats and let the money index
7487 2018-03-24 17:10:52 or semi-automatic assault rifles, or bump stocks, or armour piercing bullets or multiple round magazines. the constitution shouldn’t be left to grow cobwebs, it should change with society.
7488 2018-03-24 17:10:20 Obama didn't 'authorize' anything. (You blame him for wanting to take away all the guns & also for wanting to add  guns??)

The law at the time did not allow for bump stocks to be made illegal.

But, this is just another tweet that is all uppercase & no truth.
#Trump #bumpstocks
7489 2018-03-24 17:10:17 So you have banned bump fire stocks so do not infringe on our second amendment. Do not support any type of gun ban. It was written as law and should stay as the fore fathers intended for it to be and that means our second amendment right shall never change.
7490 2018-03-24 17:10:03 Assault rifle is a loosely used term. I agree no automatics. No bump stocks. Background checks. I also think law enforcement should be expected to prevent crimes. Almost every one of these shooters were identified. People saw and said. Nothing. This rally is for total ban.
7491 2018-03-24 17:09:47 Stocks Markets tanking. That means 401k’s and savings going away. Money means everything as you ladies know. Jump Hop Skip and run as far away from @realDonaldTrump as you can ! NOW #SAD
7492 2018-03-24 17:09:28 I don't know anything about stocks ;)
7493 2018-03-24 17:09:23 Katie rocking the ‘stocks!!! Love it!!
7494 2018-03-24 17:09:08 I'm worried. Gun control is a slippery slope. We now have a @POTUS that supports "banning anything that converts a gun into automatic weapon, e.g. bump stocks. Really, will belt loops be next b/c they do the same thing? A national registry will be next. Then what? Confiscation?
7495 2018-03-24 17:08:46 They turn the real problem into a worse one?
Why not solve the real problem.

Bump stocks are useless without semi auto rifles
7496 2018-03-24 17:08:43 Hundreds of thousands of young people are marching at @realDonaldTrump 's doorstep right now and he's tweeted nothing about it. If he does, what will the narrative be? That he said he would ban bump stocks yesterday? Not good enough! #MarchForOurLives
7497 2018-03-24 17:08:43 Obama didn't approve it.  Bump stocks didn't come under the strict technical definition already on the books. @NRA and gun fanatics took advantage of it to skirt the actual intent of the law, which was to limit automatic fire weapons. 
But you knew that.
7498 2018-03-24 17:07:39 35% on bitcoin is just a healthy correction :^)
Stocks are all overvalued.
SELL SELL SELL
7499 2018-03-24 17:07:38 What are the specific objectives of the #MarchForOurLives? @realDonaldTrump is issuing regs to ban bump stocks.  He has proposed expanded background checks and more spending on mental health.  I have yet to hear any public support for @POTUS's proposals.  Why not?

But unless you r telling me, that they really need 20 billions to reach the end of the month, their investment in stocks is with money they can spare
7502 2018-03-24 17:07:20 Students voices are being heard.  "...President Trump urged Congress 2 pass the Fix NICS & Stop School Violence Acts; it was signed into law.  Friday DOJ issued a rule to ban bump stocks which turns legal weapons into illegal machine guns..."  great work students !
7503 2018-03-24 17:07:14 Because I am not sure if Im gonna get my return back on stocks under @larrykudlowCNBC , Im gonna ask for a royalty rate on today's show, until I recoup my investment, and then it drops to a $1 royalty rate in perpetuity 
7504 2018-03-24 17:06:39 The scary factor will be the SNB who is a giant un-hedged fund long of Tech stocks and losing battle with strong CHF. when they start selling 25% down move will be nailed on.
7505 2018-03-24 17:06:26 The military weapons aka AR15 with high capacity magazines and bump stocks belong with the military not teenagers bored and frustrated nor mentally ill. It’s common sense!
7506 2018-03-24 17:06:04 Pitch of modern day "active manager" to client: Hey, I can concentrate into the prior 12 months' best performing stocks even more than your ETF can!
7507 2018-03-24 17:05:41 What are the specific objectives of the #MarchForOurLives? @realDonaldTrump is issuing regs to ban bump stocks.  He has proposed expanded background checks and more spending on mental health.  I have yet to hear any public support for @POTUS's proposals.  Did I just miss it?
7508 2018-03-24 17:04:49 Marchers - I thought BUMP STOCKS are already illegal (something POTUS did already)
7509 2018-03-24 17:04:42 Young & dumb. Obama gave em bump stocks.
7510 2018-03-24 17:04:30 Most active managers today are "choosing to invest" in $FB, $GOOGL, $AMZN at nosebleed valuations. They're "choosing to" follow the crowd to the max, and very "actively" trade around FANG stocks and show off their "alpha" skills!
7511 2018-03-24 17:04:28 Sad it’s March for our lives but your signs are March against @POTUS like he put those laws in place do you know he got rid of bump stocks and he want to make a difference stop screaming long enough to have a civil conversation  every voice needs to be heard peace and love
7512 2018-03-24 17:03:59 Obama Admin did not legalize bump stocks! What a silly reason to brag about doing nothing to curb violence!
7513 2018-03-24 17:03:55 Prosecutor Terry Curry - ban the sale of bump stocks. Be loud. Stay loud. Vote vote vote. #MarchForOurLives Indy
7514 2018-03-24 17:03:48 @hmunitedkingdom Called customer services today to check if my local store stocks maternity wear. Was told yes. My wife visited to buy and was told the store doesn't stock and she has to order online. Pretty bad customer service, wouldn't you agree? :(

7517 2018-03-24 17:02:25 Yo shit head! 17 died in Florida. The NRA ASSISTED IN THIS KILLING. What are you doing about it? You only used those kids for A PHOTO OP. We need more than your symbolic ban on bump stocks. We need MORE. You and the GOP MUST DIVORCE THE NRA WHO BOUGHT YOU!
7518 2018-03-24 17:02:13 It's like "damnnnn I wanna stomp this ngga face in but I be telling the kids to study tech and stocks and shit. I grew up with the flag but I also grew up." hilarious inner battle.
7519 2018-03-24 17:01:50 Background checks, bans on bump stocks, red flag laws, assault weapons bans... all sensible, common sense measures that preserve the second amendment and will help reduce gun violence.
7520 2018-03-24 17:01:39 Sad! 
Where is Prez? He lives @WhiteHouse in DC but he isn't there today standing with America's "March for Our Lives"  @POTUS RAN AWAY from our kids!

HE got Bump Stocks into news cycle last night along with Transgender Ban in the Military. THEN HE RAN TOWARDS HIS GOLF COURSE!
7521 2018-03-24 17:01:13 Buy BA after the market calms down along with defense stocks like Lockheed, General Dynamics, and Raytheon.  UPS will be ok since tariffs don’t matter to them.
7522 2018-03-24 17:00:51 @realDonaldTrump banning bump stocks just lost you what little voting base you had left.
7523 2018-03-24 17:00:43 Why do you always choose to lie rather than face the truth? Obama issued executive orders creating stricter regulations (all which you have reversed) But he could not ban bump stocks without new laws which GOP congress refused - YOUR INCESSANT LIES MAKE YOU LOOK STUPID #MOTUS
7524 2018-03-24 17:00:33 he’s actually not totally wrong, obama’s administration did not prohibit sales of bump stocks and were within legal jurisdiction to do so, it’s just trumps wording is bad
7525 2018-03-24 17:00:24 You had speaker "DJ" from Pacifica CA: I don't think his was so much pushback as point that "assault rifles" are one type of semiautomatic; that language might limit what needs attention. Sorta like the emphasis by some on just bump stocks.
7526 2018-03-24 17:00:01 Ban on bump stocks. Reinstate the brady ban. Restrictions on extended magazines. Mandatory insurance and registration. Tightening straw purchaser laws. Remember, this isn't just about school shootings but gun violence in general.
7527 2018-03-24 16:59:57 What are the specific objectives of this group. @realDonaldTrump is issuing regs to ban bump stocks.  He has proposed expanded background checks and more spending on mental health.  I have yet to hear any public support for @POTUS's proposals.  Did I just miss it?

7529 2018-03-24 16:59:18 If you are heavily invested in #stocks , please at least have a plan to hedge losses if there is a collapse in the $DJIA. The danger is real, don’t believe what you hear on @CNBC #bubble #bearish
7530 2018-03-24 16:58:53 Clinton still has highest stock rise in history. And our stocks rose because trump brought down the value of our dollar and we have record money from foreign investors...
7531 2018-03-24 16:58:27 @iamjohnoliver it seems there are now companies issuing cryptocurrencies instead of issuing stocks.  If you guys do a follow up, please look into that.
7532 2018-03-24 16:57:41 As someone who’s pro-gun, this is constitutional. The right to bear arms is not infringed upon by banning bump stocks. You can bumpfire without a bump stock. Besides, I’d MUCH rather banning a modification that can be abused than ban AR-15s, which have no reason to be banned.
7533 2018-03-24 16:57:21 He's obviously referring to exacerbating the problem of violent crime in giving unorganized gangs of illegals and thugs the lead to arms by breaking the law, and stockpiling unlicensed, illegal firearms!!! Isn't that why Obozo stiffened 'gun control' while legalizing bump stocks?
7534 2018-03-24 16:56:13 I agree bump stocks are not needed!
7535 2018-03-24 16:55:52 Not exactly,  it was determined that bump stocks did not fit into current law.  Which is why we need new or amended laws to cover them.  Can't change the past so fix it now so the next president doesn't have to bad mouth you about your failures. #MarchForOurLives
7536 2018-03-24 16:55:46 They actually said this today during the March! One of the speakers said "when they give an inch (bump stocks) we will take a mile"  honesty at it's best....
7537 2018-03-24 16:55:25 What do they want to take away? Bump stocks, high-capacity magazines. Impose age restrictions. None of which have anything to do with the Second Amendment
7538 2018-03-24 16:54:05 What are the specific objectives of this group. @realDonaldTrump is issuing regs to ban bump stocks.  He has proposed expanded background checks and more spending on mental health.  I have yet to hear any public support for @POTUS's proposals.  Did I just miss it?
7539 2018-03-24 16:53:49 Another lie, the only truth in this statement is that it happened in 2010 because there was no law that allowed them to regulate 2 specfic bump stocks. Obama did not legalize all bump stocks. Your lies are gonna get you soon!
7540 2018-03-24 16:53:44 Why did Obama legalize Bump Stocks?
7541 2018-03-24 16:53:19 The stock market is so crazy, when your stocks are doing good you're like, "Fuck yeah" but when they're doing bad you wanna fuckin shoot yourself. I'm $90 bucks down and I wanna RIP my fuckin hair out.
7542 2018-03-24 16:53:09 Personally I think that we should have a ban on destructive energy per second. Integrated over 30 seconds.

This type of ban recent prevents wiggle wording and technically legal things like bump stocks.

You take the mass of the bullet, and bullets per second and 1/2
7543 2018-03-24 16:53:07 This is true, but unfortunately Trump is not clean in all of this as some are saying he is.  Are you aware that Trump used the False Flag shooting in Florida as a justification for banning bump stocks?  Its in one of his latest tweets (I think yesterday).  2+2=4.
7544 2018-03-24 16:53:05 I see a ton of stocks that haven't overshot to the downside on any news in a decade.  They've rallied on every Fed speech, government saga, etc.  We are due for some irrational bearishness.  

That being said, I moved a few sheckles into stock mutuals in the 401k yesterday.
7545 2018-03-24 16:53:04 I'm not opposed to banning bump stocks, but it probably won't make us any safer. You can do the same thing with a rubber band.
7546 2018-03-24 16:52:42 You & the GOP have done nothing except continue to let the NRA dictate our gun laws! Prohibiting bump stocks is too little! Our youth is speaking to you today. They demand REAL change. The world is watching, but everyone knows you are a  incompetent, do nothing fake POUTUS.
7547 2018-03-24 16:52:30 Why not a ban on idiots instead of bump stocks?
7548 2018-03-24 16:52:21 Ban all legal weapons. ALL.. bump stocks isn't the winner to this.. Look at these people on the streets! They want more stricter gun laws... teachers armed isn't a good idea also! @BostonMetroWx
7549 2018-03-24 16:52:17 To be fair, machine guns are illegal. Items like bump stocks which can convert a semi-automatic weapon into nearly fully automatic are currently legal though.
7550 2018-03-24 16:52:16 I'm not sure hun - and also,  I think it's while stocks last
7551 2018-03-24 16:51:59 There goes $500 million more from the Snapchat stocks
7552 2018-03-24 16:51:35 Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. Ok. YOU WAN'T TO LEGALIZE THE ILLEGALS!! #betrayal #TrumpLovesIllegals You made us a fool.
7553 2018-03-24 16:51:28 We need universal background checks. A ban on high-capacity magazines, bump stocks, silencers and AR-15s. Assault weapons have no place in civilized society. The time has come. #GunControlNow #MarchForOurLives
7554 2018-03-24 16:50:49 Bump stocks ect. We have more guns than people and that is a problem.
7555 2018-03-24 16:49:20 1 Bumper tax breaks. Interest paid on cash Isas is tax-free and you don’t have to declare it on your tax return
Stocks and shares Isas are a good way to invest in the stock market without having to worry about paying capital gains tax on your profits. Some investments pay…

7559 2018-03-24 16:48:54 jindrill,alphageo like stocks underperforming heavily to crude
any divergences or good sign in oil explo stocks?
7560 2018-03-24 16:48:53 There you go AGAIN. Obama didn't approve bump stocks, but rather there was no law allowing him to restrict them at the time.
How about reading up on it "Potus"? 
And didn't YOU just roll back restrictions on the mentally ill buying guns? BAD IDEA!
7561 2018-03-24 16:48:52 Oh, and Obama, who legalized bump stocks that was used in Vegas.
7562 2018-03-24 16:48:33 Our president just banned bump stocks, which Obama made legal, and what exactly do you want our president to do Matt? Please tell us

7566 2018-03-24 16:48:14 After years of hearing racists and future Trump supporters say Obama was gonna take our guns, seeing Trump ban bump stocks might be the funniest shit ever. Top 5 at least
7567 2018-03-24 16:48:09 You've never heard of protecting fish stocks? Also, if Farage was really worried about it why didn't he turn up to any EU Parliament fishing committee meetings? He was voted in to speak up but couldn't be arsed. You were conned.
7568 2018-03-24 16:48:08 Why did Obama legalize Bump Stocks?
7569 2018-03-24 16:47:57 Stocks to Watch: ATHX, AMZN, AMZN. Read our in-depth analysis for more.
7570 2018-03-24 16:47:56 It seems like his only agenda is to convince ppl that his lies are true just as he's saying that the Obama administration legalized Bump Stocks SMDH!!!!!
7571 2018-03-24 16:47:41 Thank you for understanding this idea.  We need guns, but not bump stocks. I KNOW YOU WANT TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN! Thank you for speaking up about this issue!!!
7572 2018-03-24 16:47:35 @CNN Experts talking about bump stocks as progress.  You have entirely missed the point.  This should have been dealt with immediately after Las Vegas, but those in power held onto it as their "get out of jail free card" for the next shooting.  This is that time.  You been duped
7573 2018-03-24 16:47:10 A gimmick, gun lobby giveaway as doesn't impact their sales. 1 state sells more assault rifles than entire 50 sell bump stocks!! Carrot to distract from REAL issue
7574 2018-03-24 16:47:00 Look at the REIT stocks this week. REITs are a part of a diversified portfolio, but they're not a substitute for actual real estate. Their stocks fall on emotional trading.
7575 2018-03-24 16:46:48 Bump stocks weren’t even a part of the 2nd amendment. They aren’t even considered a gun.Bump stocks were used in shootings that killed many kids. What do we need a machine gun 4 because that is what they are.Take my other guns, trouble will be war because my guns won’t be taken.
7576 2018-03-24 16:46:29 the argument is still valid. bump stocks were only relevant in Vegas, right? i don't remember hearing about them before. Regardless, it's not the bigger issue
7577 2018-03-24 16:46:22 why are you not talking about the march? 
The future is here,  bump stocks is not nearly enough.
7578 2018-03-24 16:46:02 In addition, the March is not for taking away all guns. It is asking for reasonable regulations: bump stocks illegal, background checks which would restrict guns for the mentally ill. No, it won't prevent all gun deaths. But it will help.
7579 2018-03-24 16:45:50 Not many police with bump stocks.
Not many military assault rifles either.
Should not hurt their game much.
Maybe protect them better, given that military & law enforcement are exempt.
7580 2018-03-24 16:45:41 Why did Obama legalize bump stocks?
7581 2018-03-24 16:45:12 No pre order now but may have some in stocks
7582 2018-03-24 16:45:02 According to @SenFeinstein only Congress can ban bump stocks.
7583 2018-03-24 16:44:56 Can you provide the evidence to support this statement? I don't believe that Obama legalized bump stocks.
7584 2018-03-24 16:44:54 Common sense gun laws, background checks, bump stocks and military grade weapons? Good start?
7585 2018-03-24 16:44:50 #marchingMATILDA @FoxNews @LouDobbs 
MILLIONS MARCH AS @realDonaldTrump as @POTUS bans Obamas bump stocks....did I miss something..oh yeah...Dems have no policies for bettering country..except spending money..let them march...#MAGA
7586 2018-03-24 16:44:49 Yup! I see some big domestic threats wrapping themselves in the flag wailing "My 2nd Amendment!" when I say that high capacity magazines, bump stocks (and other such modifications) don't belong in the hands of non-military or police.
7587 2018-03-24 16:44:42 Why did Obama legalize bump stocks? Must of been money for him.  #MarchForOurLives
7588 2018-03-24 16:44:38 So we’re just going to pretend an AR-15 is not an assault rifle.?  We’re going to pretend that bump stocks don’t exist?  We’re going to pretend that this same carnage happens with handguns? Let me know when you reach reality, and then we can have an intelligent conversation.
7589 2018-03-24 16:44:34 Banning Bump Stocks is great but not nearly enough. We have the momentum now & we shouldn't settle until at least these three demands are met. #MarchForOurLives
7590 2018-03-24 16:44:24 @BMTheEquityDesk Sirji i was watching one of ur old interviews for #ETNOW in which u spoke abt HFC stocks & on market wen goes high people buy & wen it fall people tend to sell So i wanted to knw ur view on PNB HF & Canfin HF looking at current market scenario Waiting fr ur reply
7591 2018-03-24 16:44:13 BIG QUESTION = When will we have the next big correction? #Stocks #Markets
7592 2018-03-24 16:44:03 Long-term: perhaps sensible legislation that makes mass shootings--in schools and elsewhere--nearly impossible. Likely up to/including: universal background checks; higher age limit; banning bump stocks; decreasing magazine capacity; removing guns from people with certain...
7593 2018-03-24 16:44:02 Raise the legal age, strengthen back ground checks introduce meaningful accountability on manufacturers and distributors and vendors ban bump stocks and automatic weapons at the National vs the state level
7594 2018-03-24 16:43:47 Not sure loan guarantee for MF that helped put into action, even legitimized project,  can be considered all good, nor does facilitating offshore development in context of declining stocks, death of whales, opposition by Northeastern Governors?
7595 2018-03-24 16:43:32 “@silveraa: @CNNPolitics Don’t believe @realDonaldTrump is banning Bump Stocks till he signs on the dotted line.” Good one!
7596 2018-03-24 16:43:25 I don't see any control. I just hear reports of people still buying bump stocks & AR-15s, and people (teens AND teachers) STILL shooting up schools.

You need to watch more actual news, instead of propaganda.

A #WellREGULATEDMilitia , it's not.
7597 2018-03-24 16:43:10 Why in the World did Obama legalize Bump Stocks?  Must’ve had a buddy who invested in them. #worstpresidentever
7598 2018-03-24 16:43:05 For those of you who blame @realDonaldTrump for our current gun laws, remember @BarackObama's administration approved bump stocks. Stop blaming Trump and put the blame on all previous leadership. #Marchforourlives
7599 2018-03-24 16:42:51 wasn't it about May/June he started pumping stocks before 'closing his position' back end, could be same again this year :) (joking for those who missed it)
7600 2018-03-24 16:42:40 I’m sure this tweet will make their stocks drop A LOT on Monday. #girlpower
7601 2018-03-24 16:42:14 Spreading #FakeNews again @realDonaldTrump. The ATF could not legally regulate bump stocks. There is process and procedure to be followed, and Congress needed to act (ha!) but yeah, blame Obama.
7602 2018-03-24 16:41:44 France should ban bump stocks.....
7603 2018-03-24 16:41:19 The constitution has many amandments. It can be changed when necessary. You can’t kill so many so fast on purpose with a car, or a knife. Why do people feel they NEED bump stocks and high capacity magazines? Why do you feel those things are your RIGHT?
7604 2018-03-24 16:41:16 Sure thing!! It’s a small start but she gave a really good breakdown of stocks and how to get started! Her webinar was only 12 bucks but I’d say it was worth it! Coming from a cheapo like myself lol
7605 2018-03-24 16:40:58 The republicans moved bump stocks along w NRA funding. Those that approved it have the death of those killed in Las Vegas on them
7606 2018-03-24 16:40:53 The ATF authorized bump stocks. Get your facts straight.
7607 2018-03-24 16:40:31 Yay for more meaningless legislation. I’m sure the next mass shooter is out there right now, wallowing in utter discouragement because bump stocks will no longer be legal... <golf clap>

7609 2018-03-24 16:40:13 Chris Dillow p18 saying UK Stocks are cheap relative to US - "The UK, then, is relatively cheap. In the past, this has mattered." He's arguing that UK could play catch up.

7612 2018-03-24 16:39:52 Doesn't contradict what I said - especially the central point that UK waters are home to 70% of EU fishing stocks, yet thanks to CFP quotas, UK runs a trade deficit in fish.

7616 2018-03-24 16:38:59 IDIOT! This is NOT about Obama and bump stocks. The Florida massacre was carried out by assault weapons! And you refuse to outlaw them!! Stop blaming others and start taking responsibility for action to change!
7617 2018-03-24 16:38:56 I believe in the second amendment. I believe in the right to bear arms. I believe in common sense gun laws. I believe in stricter background checks.  I DON'T believe people need assault weapons, bump stocks, and high capacity magazines. #MarchForOurLives #NeverAgain
7618 2018-03-24 16:38:54 Great! Thank you. I know the library *definitely* stocks some good autiebiographies, as I've taken several out from there in the past! I'm sure we can give them a list of suggestions if needed.
7619 2018-03-24 16:38:47 Waiting for Trump to announce the crowds are marching to thank him for eliminating bump stocks
7620 2018-03-24 16:38:25 "today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period." Thanks, but what does that really mean?
7621 2018-03-24 16:38:20 Bump stocks are still 1 shot per trigger pull, they just allow for faster shots based on applying forward pressure after the recoil. I think they shouldn't be sold, but just clarifying what they do.
7622 2018-03-24 16:38:03 Constant false narrative. The administration found that ATF did not have the right to regulate bump stocks. Please speak truth you snake oil salesmen.
7623 2018-03-24 16:37:09 Bump stocks are not the problem. Banning them will do nothing.
7624 2018-03-24 16:36:52 @GOP @realDonaldTrump "U.S. stocks suffered their worst week in more than two years, signaling mounting investor anxiety over whether factors from restrictive trade policies" Way to go dumba$$! The one accomplishment you claimed is now in the crapper. Unfit! #TrumpLies #midterms
7625 2018-03-24 16:36:44 Bump stocks (how were these ever ok in the first place?), drum style magazines, grenade launcher attachments, banning those. Background checks: integrating state/nationwide systems, denials for people convicted of stalking or with a history of violent crimes....
7626 2018-03-24 16:36:39 The commenting period will allow the makers of bump stocks to sell millions more before they are deemed illegal.
7627 2018-03-24 16:36:24 Anybody know if Trump recently invested in any companies that sell bump stocks?
 I’m sure they’re flying off the shelves.
7628 2018-03-24 16:35:50 @Kaybirds Right now gold, physical gold, Bitcoin up. Tech stocks IBM, T, AAPL etc. down. Raytheon up. Watch China on Tuesday!
7629 2018-03-24 16:35:46 BUMP STOCKS ARE...BREADCRUMBS!!! #marchforourlives #GunReformNow
7630 2018-03-24 16:35:24 @AMarch4OurLives So we ban “assault” guns, bump stocks, raise legal age, all that you ask. What will be the next step when the despicable person, the mentally disturbed kid gets his gun and shoots up a gun free school? What will you demand then? Seems that you ignore the obvious.
7631 2018-03-24 16:35:02 Is it so hard to imagine the 2nd amendment WITHOUT assault weapons? Bump stocks? High capacity magazines? Over the counter sales?  It it so hard to imagine it WITH reasonable proof of sanity and Emotional stability? Valid proof of citizenship? A waiting period? Didn’t think so.
7632 2018-03-24 16:33:58 I can't wait for the Snap stocks to fall again
7633 2018-03-24 16:33:57 #MarchForOurLives, because a ban on bump stocks should have been passed the week after the Las Vegas massacre.
7634 2018-03-24 16:33:37 Bitch can't even read or do mathematics but talking about stocks  man I done heard it all..
7635 2018-03-24 16:33:22 Brian

Where was your pity party when Bump stocks killed dozens?
7636 2018-03-24 16:33:19 When you ban bump stocks, the only people who will have bump stocks are the transgenders who get kicked out of the military.
7637 2018-03-24 16:33:16 #StonemanDouglas student Delaney Tart: When they give us that inch...bump stocks ban, we will take a mile. We are not here for bread crumbs #MarchForOurLives
7638 2018-03-24 16:33:13 Fake tweet, Trump. Bump stocks did not qualify for regulation according to the law at the time.
7639 2018-03-24 16:33:06 WRONG!  At the time ATF, a bureau within the executive branch, determined that they DID NOT HAVE LEGAL GROUNDS to regulate bump stocks.  On the other hand,YOU HAVE WEAKENED AND ELIMINATED gun control regulations!!!

7641 2018-03-24 16:32:12 Obama didn't legalize bump stocks. Nobody legalized them, someone just started making them and nobody stopped it. 

How stupid do you think we are? Please stop lying CONSTANTLY!!!!
7642 2018-03-24 16:32:06 This is what we ALL need right now, gun control: ban on assault weapons, high capacity magazines and bump stocks. That would heal all of us. The 2nd Amendment is not a right to own assault weapons. more @washingtonpost @CNN
7643 2018-03-24 16:31:42 At what point were bump stocks ever illegal until Obama made them legal?  They were never illegal.
7644 2018-03-24 16:30:43 The stocks of #CambridgeAnalytica must have zoomed with all the paid media gunning after it globally

Have some sense lay folks. The fallout is a facade . they r not evem part if the tip of the iceberg. . .

7647 2018-03-24 16:30:38 They are marching to protect life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Common sense gun laws, background checks, banning bump stocks (unavailable when Constitution was written) are crucial! Do the naysayers only want muzzle loaders? That's what my father shot and collected.
7648 2018-03-24 16:30:03 Well like you said mental tests but not raise the age for all weapons maybe ar 15s with magazines that only hold like 5-10 shells instead of 30 and get rid of bump fire stocks. I own one and it can make a rifle *seem auto even tho it isn't but it takes practice to use those.
7649 2018-03-24 16:29:46 Well, we Vietnamese boil meat in stocks :V
7650 2018-03-24 16:29:24 Do you have a problem with bump stocks being banned? High capacity  magazines?
7651 2018-03-24 16:29:18 "legalized bump stocks" - obvious lie
"BAD IDEA" - OK, that part's true.
The rest is an open attempt to take the least possible action he can, which he can then abandon 6 months later. Anybody want to take that bet?
7652 2018-03-24 16:28:31 Bump fire stocks should be banned. I will agree with that
7653 2018-03-24 16:28:20 There are likely all kinds of laws that could be passed, like age restrictions, limiting who can purchase a gun; as well as restrictions on the kinds of guns available to the public (semi-automatic rifles, bump stocks, etc.) I’m no expert, but I think conversations must happen.
7654 2018-03-24 16:26:40 Après je prend pas partie mais certe les mecs stocks vous soulèvent.. mais les gens endurants sont des skinnys (je me fie au jeux olympiques ), 
7655 2018-03-24 16:25:52 No doubt, and that may be the biggest "hidden" factor. My protest is more pragmatic. I don't see need 30rd mags or bump stocks. I wish for stringent background & waiting periods. Just make it less convenient.
7656 2018-03-24 16:25:08 I don't care if bumpstocks are banned. I agree that they are just a novelty that have no other purpose & are dangerous. Bump stocks are not protected by the constitution. They can "come after" guns like they always do. That doesn't mean they'll get them.
7657 2018-03-24 16:24:19 Y'all do realize that with the bump stock you can only empty a 30 round clip 1 maybe 1 1/2 seconds faster than just standard firing. So yes if it shut you up then please ban bump stocks and then crawl back into your safe space and leave the rest of us the h*ll alone

7660 2018-03-24 16:22:18 Nothing about this tweet is true. Obama did not legalize bump stocks. You made that up. Obama-era ATF ruled was out of their jurisdiction. So did Trump ATF in 2017. You are doing this today because #March4OurLives.   Notably you didn’t do it after Vegas shooting.
7661 2018-03-24 16:22:01 The above data is for stocks and crypto/blockchain related stocks.. All of the altcoins traded on the major crypto exchanges are being added shortly to the TI trading platform.
7662 2018-03-24 16:21:58 So after smoke clears, speeches done, and parade areas cleaned what happens next? Lier and Chief removing bump stocks.  Spit in the Ocean. Again, will Congress erupt in a show of strength and finally protect our children, or will they continue head in the sand and bow to NRA?
7663 2018-03-24 16:21:58 waiting for the NRA to offer you more money to forget about the bump stocks. don't forget about the 2nd amendment
7664 2018-03-24 16:21:43 Today I am in awe and appreciation for everyone speaking out against senseless gun violence. While I don't support full bans, there are commonsense laws & practices that we desperately need to help protect our kids, and ourselves. Banning bump stocks is a start. #MarchForOurLives
7665 2018-03-24 16:21:28 You can't ban bump-stocks
7666 2018-03-24 16:20:57 If you’re not able to get a weapon in the normal way; don’t despair! 3D printers are capable of unlimited weapons and ammunition. You can even make bump stocks!
7667 2018-03-24 16:20:52 Hate to see you catering to the public demand, rather than your integrity and good thinking.... BTW, bump stocks are just trivial fun and nothing to fret about.
7668 2018-03-24 16:20:51 Its to tell spend some time with friends nd family apart from pharma stocks ;-)
7669 2018-03-24 16:20:49 ..@realDonaldTrump...donnie trump is such a sleazy president he knows President Obama did not endorse the use of Bump stocks.....

7671 2018-03-24 16:20:41 The text is hard to differentiate with the background being identically the same color, try using glows or other stocks to add a lighter background behind the text in the future, it'll keep the text intact while giving it more depth.
7672 2018-03-24 16:20:37 Happy Birthday Blessings PT! 
7673 2018-03-24 16:20:37 Jeff sessions is already calling bump stocks machine guns, and they're going to be banned. You don't think they're coming after the guns? you just watch.
7674 2018-03-24 16:19:32 @realDonaldTrump President Obama put restrictions on Bump Stocks. Could not do more because Congress refused. LEARN THE FACTS!! You accused Congress of not reading the spending bill--did you read it before you signed it????? One basic legal principle--NEVER SIGN before you read!!
7675 2018-03-24 16:19:18 Please... Bump stocks are a minuscule issue in this arena.  Arming teachers is ridiculous. Do something useful like implementing a meaningful background check system. Legal weapons kill too.  Ask Parkland. Wake up.

176 days to act.  How incompetent are you?  You are an incompetent and impotent group of reactionary troglodytes.
7677 2018-03-24 16:18:41 @realDonaldTrump No Donald, the Obama administration DIDN'T legalize bump stocks. They ruled that there was no law making them illegal. There is a difference. YOU can make them and assault rifles illegal. But will the NRA let you? #NRApuppet

7680 2018-03-24 16:18:26 It seems that there is a false statement going around that Obama legalized bump stocks...isn't it great to always have someone to blame for everything.
7681 2018-03-24 16:18:08 I’m glad bump stocks are outlawed. I’m assuming you don’t own a gun. I’m glad for that too. It seems like you wouldn’t know how to care for it or protect it properly. Guns can be and are used responsibly millions of times a day.
7682 2018-03-24 16:18:00 Good luck to people holding stocks. Major supports are being broken. Welcoming you to the fact that the stock market itself is a bubble but it’s worth 100s of trillions of dollars so it’s less volatile. It ain’t rocket science my boy.
7683 2018-03-24 16:17:35 Is there a place where the #MarchForOurLives people have listed what sort of #GunControl changes they are looking for?  Is the list logical, like calling for bans on bump stocks, or just “ban all guns”?
7684 2018-03-24 16:17:23 @davidhogg111 Ban Bump Stocks, enforce background checks. I would not own an AR-15, but it is not an assault rifle. It is a semi-automatic rifle made to look like an assault rifle.  There are ways to curb gun violence without attacking guns.
7685 2018-03-24 16:16:52 ATF technology chief John Spencer determined that bump stocks were not regulated by law as stated under the Gun Conrol Act (1968) or the National Firearms Act. (1934)
So Obama owns this how?
7686 2018-03-24 16:16:13 Wise move raffling as you will raise a lot more money to support CHAS Rebecca, best of luck to the winner

7688 2018-03-24 16:15:31 Dami dami ko na stocks ng tissue
7689 2018-03-24 16:15:19 Not enough! Simply and truthfully, NOT ENOUGH. The bump stocks were not used in ANY of the school shootings, and the “urging” of Trump to congress is all talk. It is obvious that NRA money is more important to Republicans, than  stoping the slaughter of our children, at school.
7690 2018-03-24 16:13:56 It doesnt undermine "my point" at all. The truth is - Iraq had caches of thousands of buried chemical weapon stocks, being hidden from the UN weapons inspectors. Some of those caches have been found, & some have been taken for re-use by ISIS.
YOUR ignorance is not MY problem.
7691 2018-03-24 16:13:51 Obama didn't legalize bump stocks. The manufacturer told the ATF in 2010 the product was "intended to assist persons whose hands have limited mobility." The ATF determined it was a "firearm part" and thus could not regulate it under the Gun Control Act or National Firearms Act.
7692 2018-03-24 16:13:49 Evil people WITH bump stocks.
7693 2018-03-24 16:13:08 Its a give away dont let this bother you bump stocks are not important. AR-15s are.
7694 2018-03-24 16:13:06 why so pessimistic 3x to 4x in selects stocks like carnon ones possible . why bother for 50% returns ...
7695 2018-03-24 16:13:00 WATCH: Trump tweets that he will ban bump stocks
7696 2018-03-24 16:12:40 Trump will ban bump stocks until the NRA gets him in a room alone then Trump will tell a different story. Trump is afraid of the NRA.
7697 2018-03-24 16:12:14 If he bans bump stocks or any property I now legally own, in direct violation of the 2A, he will not have my support.

7701 2018-03-24 16:09:31 Of course not, even though bump stocks are a ridiculous sideline of the real issues. The same thing can be done with a finger, or a rubber band.
7702 2018-03-24 16:09:22 Stop lying to Americans. Obama did not legalize bump stocks!
7703 2018-03-24 16:09:17 teens texting while driving kills more every year than bump stocks do,try getting them to quit that, bump stock actually over heat and jam a weapon so they do less damage.

He & his sons have assault rifles they plan 2 keep them, plus the NRA is paying him over 30 millon dollars 2 keep them

7709 2018-03-24 16:07:33 @potus From President to Fuhrer. It was easy wasn't it. Bumper Stocks and signing the Omnibus. Rip up the rest of the Constitution. Throw it all away.
7710 2018-03-24 16:07:27 Obama hardly "legalized" them. In 2010, the ATF, under NRA questioning, determined that bump stocks were not regulated under current law. So, if you want to point a finger -- point it at the NRA from bringing it up in the first place. #partisanMoron #uselessOldMan #yourefired
7711 2018-03-24 16:07:24 And hopefully new laws will help keep guns from felons and mentally ill ppl....and get rid of military style guns and bump stocks...keep everything else!
7712 2018-03-24 16:07:14 RT @CNNPolitics: At #MarchForOurLives, Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar says President Trump's steps to ban bump stocks are a "good thing," bu…
7713 2018-03-24 16:06:40 So you are in favor of bump stocks being legal?
7714 2018-03-24 16:06:23 Pwede nyab try yung eyebrow pencil na 199... Baka yun afford nya. Yun eh kung may stocks pa. 
7715 2018-03-24 16:06:09 Big deal.  The NRA told Donnie they don't care about bump stocks. If they did this ban wouldn't have happened.
7716 2018-03-24 16:06:04 Here's an honest question....if millions of items such as AR-15's, high capacity magazines, bump stocks, etc. are banned, what is the plan to get these existing items them off the street?

There is none, which makes the legislation essentially useless. 

No common sense here...
7717 2018-03-24 16:05:56 You may only invest 'spare' money in stocks, but a number of people invest all their value in a basket of markets- like 10% gold, 50% blue chips, 20% property, and the rest either high or medium risk instruments like currencies or non-blue chip stock; or even crypto.

7720 2018-03-24 16:05:08 RIGHT! The reason people are so fucking furious with the NRA is they’ve successfully lobbied for years against any proposed, no matter how small. I mean bump stocks? They’ve been pro since Vegas. That’s such a minor issue & they’re still relentless calling it an infringement
7721 2018-03-24 16:03:57 QUEST INSTANT GAZEBO PICK OF THE DAY ON NOW!! TUNE IN AND GET YOURS WHILE STOCKS LAST!
7722 2018-03-24 16:03:35 Because in order to invest on the scale I'm talking about, a combination of cash and risk-taking is involved. I would never recommend individual stocks to those without wiggle room. BTW I advocate Roth IRAs for any worker.

And yes, Starbucks does offer free college....
7723 2018-03-24 16:03:26 Es gibt auch eine offizielle Presseerklärung und eine Gesetzesinitiative zum Verbot von bump stocks ...
Cartoons sind sicher spannende, ... für Trump
7724 2018-03-24 16:03:24 The stocks is very bad days with trump
7725 2018-03-24 16:03:13 You really are clueless. The Obama administration did not legalize bump-fire stocks. They were already legal under current law, and will continue to be despite your bogus regulation. Get ready for a legal battle.
7726 2018-03-24 16:03:10 Bout to roll up read up on how to get into these stocks... 

Then hit the gym and get on my hustle for the day...
7727 2018-03-24 16:02:45 Fix NICS, and yeah, ban bump stocks while you're at it.
7728 2018-03-24 16:02:42 Well, I haven't seen any increase in $, and my income is poverty level. My brother and my father, who are middle income, haven't seen an increase either, but WERE pleased their stocks went up. NOW, however, they are super unhappy with their stock plummet and the new budget. Boooo
7729 2018-03-24 16:02:32 Excited to see CUCC Male Mentoring engaging in a conversations with mentees about money and stocks. Teaching Robert Rules of order. #trainingachild #blackwallstreet #blackwealth
7730 2018-03-24 16:02:20 I  don’t either but if you change your mind there’s an unlimited supply. It’s okay though because it’s illegal to print guns ammunition and bump stocks with a 3D printer.
7731 2018-03-24 16:02:09 How many people have been killed by bump stocks again?
7732 2018-03-24 16:02:09 I am virtually marching today for the lives of our children and grandchildren, for the banning of automatic weapons, for the banning of bump stocks, for the end of school shootings and for the demise of the NRA. @maddow @JoyAnnReid @20committee #MarchForOurLives
7733 2018-03-24 16:01:08 I don't think Obama had anything to do with bump stocks.
7734 2018-03-24 16:00:28 Obama did not legalize bump stocks.
7735 2018-03-24 16:00:16 Lies. Obama admin didn't legalize bump stocks. You're #FakeNews

You're a disgrace.

7738 2018-03-24 15:59:47 I'm sorry you went to all the trouble of posting these tweets. Bump stocks aren't "arms" but I had a good laugh at the thought of Trump reading something.
7739 2018-03-24 15:59:38 (1) False. Congress refused to draft legislation to support a proposed restriction on bump stocks during O-admin. (2) You don't seem to understand administrative procedure, but hey, I actually hope this particular unilateral use of executive power works out for you. #ITMFA
7740 2018-03-24 15:59:10 Hi Michael, thanks for the Tweet. Both of these items are currently on offer while stocks last in selected Morrisons stores. Mark
7741 2018-03-24 15:58:48 Trump says President Obama legalized bump stocks. We suppose Melania approved of Trump's escapades of sexual assault and adultery.
7742 2018-03-24 15:58:15 Kidding? So much to unpack. Universal background check isn’t blaming anyone. Banning bump stocks isn’t blaming anyone. Sure it’s slightly inconvenient for some people, as is any regulation. But the idea that everyday Americans are being blamed is just silly and incorrect.
7743 2018-03-24 15:58:13 No. Common sense laws include things like banning bump stocks, mandatory and uniform background checks, mandatory waiting periods. Literally things no law abiding citizen should have issue with as it will never effect them negatively.
7744 2018-03-24 15:58:12 Great for Gold stocks
7745 2018-03-24 15:57:54 Bump stocks is not the problem with gun violence seems everyone is missing the main problem.The main problem is how easy to get a hand on even a pistol in America.That has to be fixed am not saying scrap the second amendment but something has to be done
7746 2018-03-24 15:57:52 This is another lie....they did not legalize bump stocks....what is wrong with you???I guess he did that when he surveilled Trump towers????....You lie all the damn time
7747 2018-03-24 15:57:45 Well what do you mean?  Fact,  Obama allowed bump stocks (which i agree with) and now Trump is banning it but is actually doing the exact thing trump haters wanted
7748 2018-03-24 15:57:35 Of course not professional money managers pick stocks in the market based on fundamental criteria generally I believe in that I don't believe in trying to time or predict short-term movements ever
7749 2018-03-24 15:57:20 Wrong! Pres Obama did not legalize Bump Stocks more Trump BS! YOU are bought by NRA not Pres Obama! You ran from DC today from MarchForOurLives the Generation who has courage to make Change in America not only gun laws but DC corruption and You!
7750 2018-03-24 15:56:59 #MarchForOurLives
Presidet Trump: Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns
7751 2018-03-24 15:56:40 This is one of the dumber posts I've ever seen you make. Bump stocks don't magically turn guns into machine guns.
7752 2018-03-24 15:56:32 This week was fun being long gold and short stocks ( the normal inverse relationship ).
7753 2018-03-24 15:56:08 US justice department announces proposal to ban bump stocks
7754 2018-03-24 15:56:03 Things like this WON'T get you re-elected. Bump stocks don't kill anyone. It's a mental health issue, can't say no society, single family parenting, every gets a participation  trophy, take the man out of male PC world we live in is the problem. Fix those issues, problem solved!
7755 2018-03-24 15:55:55 There is no earthly reason to allow bump stocks to the general public. This is how far the GOP has fallen to the lure of NRA money. Vote them out - NOW!!!
7756 2018-03-24 15:55:41 Sorry I have to weigh in. According to trusted sources Obama approved  the legality of bump stocks in 2010. When used correctly they are deadly. When held firmly jamming decreases dramatically. One use is all it takes to maim or kill many. Should be outlawed.
7757 2018-03-24 15:55:14 Also, Congress and Trump promised to ban bump stocks after Las Vegas and didn’t do it. Then Trump spouted off about taking the guns and the NRA has lunch with him and he got back on board with them. People are sick of the NRA’s unwillingness to address the problem.
7758 2018-03-24 15:54:50 We need an app to trade stocks easily-no fuss,minimal shares, maybe no fees. A couple of steps like bank transfers. See stocks I want to grab, hold a short while and sell-win or loss. Oh-well. Great work folks-I'm leaning on your horn.
7759 2018-03-24 15:54:47 @realDonaldTrump no tweets this morning! Is it because you chose the NRA and it’s money over protecting the kids in our country. Stop saying we are coming for their guns. We support the 2nd amendment but believe no one needs an AK-15 or bump stocks!
7760 2018-03-24 15:54:24 Ich glaaube es weiter, denn Dank der bump stocks werden sie zu Waffen mit Dauerfeuer, wie in Las Vegas. Aber da Sie ja der Waffenexperte von uns beiden sind, wussten Sie das sicher. Achnja, was bump stocks sind kann man googeln. Ihnen auch einen schönen, schiessereifreien Tag.
7761 2018-03-24 15:54:12 are you watching your tv.........getting rid of the bump stocks is NOT ENOUGH  just remember........in a couple of years these will be voters.......hope republicans are watching
7762 2018-03-24 15:54:09 Marches are mere entertainment for children and the simple-minded. America is not governed by mob rule; that’s third world stuff. This is a complex issue for which no simplistic solutions will do, and primarily concerns attitude, not ability. That said, ban bump stocks.
7763 2018-03-24 15:54:09 ...that statement by the NRA is NOT TRUE...we want ASSAULT WEAPONS BANNED, they have no place in our society, are Weapons of Mass Destruction designed to KILL; we want BUMP STOCKS BANNED; we want SENSIBLE GUN REGISTRATION/LICENSING...
PLEASE STOP LYING NRA...WORK WITH US...PLEASE
7764 2018-03-24 15:54:09 Personally I don’t use cash, because… Technology. 

I use Acorns to round up my dollars into Stocks and Bonds.
7765 2018-03-24 15:54:08 They do, & also teach that SCOTUS has ruled gun regs are consistent with 2A. Based on these rulings, US could: 1) require background checks for ALL gun transactions; 2) ban assault weapons (and ban bump stocks); and, 3) require a reasonable waiting period to acquire any weapon.
7766 2018-03-24 15:53:48 Fucking Moron - This is yet another lie. And YOU approved of bump stocks until Vegas mass murder happened yet you’ve still taken no action agains them!  Not all Americans are stupid and believe your bs.
7767 2018-03-24 15:53:33 But the Corp of Army Engineers just received access to billions if they had to build something.... I don’t know maybe a WALL
7768 2018-03-24 15:53:12 It will be interesting to see how Trump’s administration plans to resolve the legal issues Obama team encountered on bump stocks. Methinks they will (yet again) get taken to court and lose because they don’t understand the law or our system.
7769 2018-03-24 15:52:51 Guns are constitutional. Bump stocks arent.
7770 2018-03-24 15:52:50 Yes...checkout the list I posted esrlier... lots of oil and gas stocks
7771 2018-03-24 15:52:45 Nobody wants the second amendment taken away, and it's bump stocks.
7772 2018-03-24 15:51:56 Liar. Agency found that it was not authorized by law to regulate bump stocks bed they are not guns, they are a "part."  @GOP is in bed w/ @NRA Your lies cannot change that.  #BloodyHands
7773 2018-03-24 15:51:50 It's not about banning ALL guns. Not sure where you heard that (FOX? NRA?) It is about getting rid of assault weapons. Banning bump stocks. Universal background checks. End to the gun show loophole. Waiting periods for purchase. Not a complete ban. Google. It's your friend.
7774 2018-03-24 15:51:35 #MarchoftheBigLie
7775 2018-03-24 15:51:19 at dahil diyan..... will do my own HONEST review when I get my stocks.
7776 2018-03-24 15:51:11 Wrong, as usual! The Obama administration did not “legalize” bump stocks. The prevailing gun laws at the time (and still today) prevented the Obama administration from being able to prohibit them. Don’t let the facts get in the way of a Rump tweet!
7777 2018-03-24 15:51:06 Ich weiß es und darum kann man hier mit so genannten bump stocks mit denen halbautomatische Waffen aufegrüstet werden. Aber Sie als erklärter Waffenexperte wussten das sicher.

7779 2018-03-24 15:50:56 In the Vegas shooting semiautomatic weapons were used so butt stocks were not required to modify them! I am a retired combat veteran all I’m saying is my 2 amendment should not b taken away because of those that don’t follow the law
7780 2018-03-24 15:50:46 If you want to expose a pumper ,Notice the hype & RTs when his Chatroom Banks on a stock ONLY “they traded” Vs a stock everyone else traded. stocks that “spikes” from $1-$3 and back down to $1 in that hour? That’s a RED FLAG. How come your room didn’t trade $GERN? .#pumpdump
7781 2018-03-24 15:50:27 I sense action being driven by the threat of lawsuits due to negligence - failure to protect. Hmmmm...probably time for a significant lawsuit against manufacturers of after market products ie bump stocks and high capacity mags

7785 2018-03-24 15:49:27 "... & signed them into law. Additionally, on Friday, the Department of Justice issued the rule to ban bump stocks following thru on the President's commitment to band devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns..." Thank you students

7788 2018-03-24 15:48:55 $FUSZ. gained 26.23%   , and has now gained 11 days in a row. It is not often that stocks manage to gain so many days in a row, and falls for a day or two should be expected. The price has risen in 10 of the last 10 days and is up by 214.22% over the past 2 weeks.
7789 2018-03-24 15:48:52 I oppose this. Banning bump stocks is pointless and unconstitutional. Plus, it won't solve the school shootings that have been happening recently. 

We don't need anymore gun control garbage. 

Disappointed in you Mr. President.

7793 2018-03-24 15:47:56 I’m waiting but the swing up from $SQ and $SHOP bout to me insane. If you’ve been following both stocks you know their swing up after a retracement like this is nothing short of magnificent
7794 2018-03-24 15:47:16 Nothing’s more depressing than shelling out $150 to start a stock portfolio just to purchase 10 stocks of a company. I’m so poor.
7795 2018-03-24 15:47:10 The store in Plainfield, IN. Honestly if Kroger had a nicer store in Plainfield I would shop there. Out of stocks and bad produce are the norm at this location. I shop at the Meijer on Southport Rd occasionally & it’s a much better experience.
7796 2018-03-24 15:47:09 Man I don’t even know if I even need a husband. I just need someone who wants to have sex, pumps my gas and stocks my fridge with those little red grapefruit cups.
7797 2018-03-24 15:46:59 Wow not banning bump stocks was what ya'll were bitching about after LV shooting Now, that they are banned you are bitching again. Just for the record not everyone agrees with the liberal anti gun $$ sponsored marches which exploit traumatized children.
7798 2018-03-24 15:46:52 I am a gun owner as well. I am also over 21, and can pass a strict background check. It's also a handgun for my families protection. No one needs an assault rifle or bump stocks to hunt or for protection. That's all these kids want.
7799 2018-03-24 15:46:51 So long as bump stocks are illegal for BOTH police and citizen, I have no problem with this.

I don't get it we all can't make a living in stocks and paper. A country that builds nothing will go away.
7801 2018-03-24 15:46:20 Reporting people making threatening statements. Banning assault style weapons, bump stocks, large ammo clips.  The government is our representative, our power over evil people. The NRA bullies politicians and lies to the people to protect gun manufacturers profits.

Do yourself a favor and look up ALL companies that produce weapons for the military. Northrup Grumman, General Dynamic, Boeing...

7808 2018-03-24 15:45:16 I like to trade $SPY $QQQ $IWM on days the market is moving big, especially on expiration days. When the market is flatter, I tend to look at individual stocks gapping up or down at least 3% on a catalyst, then look for a setup to trade on one of those. If neither, I don't trade.

7810 2018-03-24 15:45:04 No. Ban assault weapons and high capacity magazine racks, and bump stocks.  Make mental health exams mandatory, registrations, offer gun buy-back programs.  Set up regulations like they have in Australia, or Israel, or Norway, or pick your country because it's better than the US.
7811 2018-03-24 15:44:55 Bump stocks don’t increase rate of fire, and no normal civilian owns fully automatic rifles. Assault rifle is a made up term for guns that are black and scary with rails on them for attachments.
7812 2018-03-24 15:44:09 But that law is probably not applicable here because this is crypto and not stocks... </s>
7813 2018-03-24 15:44:03 No actually Obama DID approve bump stocks but I agree they should go. Now how is the ban on drugs working out? That’s exactly how one on guns will work. Bad guys will always have guns...period. Can a hammer drive a nail without a man helping? Then how can a gun be responsible?
7814 2018-03-24 15:42:55 They didnt legalize bump stocks, you twit. Pay attention in your briefings, watch something other than Fox News. GET OUT OF YOUR COMFORT ZONE
7815 2018-03-24 15:42:48 On 4 October 2017 senator Dianne Feinstein introduced a bill to ban bump stocks,[4] but as of November 3, 2017, no Congressional action had resulted.

7819 2018-03-24 15:42:01 Since Trump's goal was to reverse everything @BarackObama did, it's no wonder stocks are going down. It's part of his overall plan. 
7820 2018-03-24 15:41:56 @WuShocks people who follow this person; if you would like to have your own guns, bump stocks or ammunition and you don’t live close to Indiana, don’t despair! Buy a 3D printer. Instructions for guns etc. are very easy to find and make.
7821 2018-03-24 15:41:21 Like stocks: humiliating glucose, energetically worn.
7822 2018-03-24 15:40:50 He just banned bump-stocks. Something Obama made legal. He’s done more, and listened more than his predecessor. These are neither of their faults, but you seem to be missing the facts of what @realDonaldTrump is doing for this issue. Your uneducated biased slander needs a fix
7823 2018-03-24 15:40:48 Blah Blah Blah, another useless act designed to appease. Bump stocks are in fact extremely rare, they are a problem and should be banned, but they aren't THE problem, they just provide convenient cover so you can look like you're doing something without doing anything. Congrats.
7824 2018-03-24 15:40:22 His tweet is absolutely ridiculous of course and obviously just banning bump stocks is not the answer. However every little bit helps, bump stocks were used in the Vegas shooting.
7825 2018-03-24 15:40:16 At some point it’s not that QE “won’t work”, it’s that the effect will stop flowing into higher equities and tighter credit spreads. When QE starts flowing only into gold and inflation hedges, but not stocks/junk bonds, then its game over for markets.
7826 2018-03-24 15:39:29 Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns. @realDonaldTrump
7827 2018-03-24 15:39:19 Yet your buddy Dwan continues to ask for significant cod removals, continues to deflect from the 3 of the main factors probably causing this drastic setback, and goes off on a totally unrelated issue: "Look everyone! OCI draggers don't care about 3Ps cod stocks." Speak up brother
7828 2018-03-24 15:39:17 But many of the scary things often cited like controlling larger magazines, eliminating adjustable stocks & pistol grips, bayonet lug (the AW ban), etc., are meaningless arguments. I can change a magazine nearly as fast as not so 5, 10, 30, 100 doesn’t matter

7836 2018-03-24 15:36:40 Bump stocks do not turn semi auto into auto. They allow people to mimic auto fire at the expense of accuracy.
7837 2018-03-24 15:36:08 Crickets?  He essentially banned bump stocks.  Something Obama allowed.  He has been talking with the NRA about raising the age.  He has done more than Clinton (Columbine) and Obama (Newtown) have ever done.  Wake up.
7838 2018-03-24 15:35:56 I thought Obama was coming for everyone’s guns.  Now you say he legalized bump stocks. Well what is it, moron????  #fool
7839 2018-03-24 15:35:22 I didn't know that poor people needed 100-round magazines and bump stocks.
7840 2018-03-24 15:34:28 Please stop spreading FAKE NEWS. Obama did NOT legalize bump stocks. You are a liar.
7841 2018-03-24 15:34:04 Mark it isn’t an excuse that if we didn’t sign it the credit would rank and so would the stocks.

Trump campaigned against it. He wanted to veto it and wasn’t happy. We know he’s genuine and said he will never sign something like that again. These aren’t excuses.

7846 2018-03-24 15:33:16 @realdonaldtrump is taking credit for banning bump stocks . . .

As if bump stocks are the only way to make an AR15 fully automatic. 

But he is not banning assault weapons.

Yeah nah, but here is something we will do. Remember bump-stocks? What we propose is to direct the justice department to write a memo technically making them illegal until someone writes another memo rescinding that memo. Good?
7849 2018-03-24 15:32:29 "... and sign them into law. Additionally on Friday the Department of Justice issued the rule to ban bump stocks following thru on the president's commitment to ban devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns..." students are making a difference

7852 2018-03-24 15:31:31 Hear hear! These arguments that he's too young and stupid to speak out or have an opinion... oh, but not too young and stupid to own assault weapons  expanded magazine capacities, silencers and bump stocks. 

America! Love it or change it!
7853 2018-03-24 15:31:22 Glad to see Mr Golf-a-lot has his priorities straight and is in FL. Also, (you will know this already) banning bump stocks through regulation change likely not effective (see tweet below) Federal legislation needs to be introduced. So his plan is practically useless.
7854 2018-03-24 15:31:22 Yes, ban bump stocks. It's a federal felony to alter and semi automatic to make it Auto. Doing that shows that the person has no regard for law.
7855 2018-03-24 15:29:18 Justice Dept can't actually ban bump stocks.
7856 2018-03-24 15:28:46 You just have a hard time believing he'd sign that bill, pay off those women, ban bump stocks, have callous comments come from his office and then cynically spend the weekend golfing.  It's a bitter pill but if you didn't see it coming it's on you.
7857 2018-03-24 15:28:28 Butt stocks change an ordinary weapon into an automatic weapon that’s what butt stocks do seriously they can do a lot of damage look at Vegas using ur reference

7861 2018-03-24 15:26:25 The difference is that signing the omnibus happened along with other really bad things (hiring John Bolton AND banning bump stocks).

7867 2018-03-24 15:25:08 You are in right stocks it seems.
7868 2018-03-24 15:24:56 Obama didn’t legalize bump stocks. He fought hard to ban assault weapons and impose better gun control laws. Your @GOP congress blocked him every step of the way. And you still continue to do everything the @NRA pats you to do! #Corruption
7869 2018-03-24 15:24:44 Lie about Obama and bump stocks. Millions hit street to March for Our Lives. Stormy Sunday!! If he wasn’t such an a$$hole, I might feel sorry for FakeAss President! Page 2
7870 2018-03-24 15:24:42 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS 
Y haven’t u OWNED UP 2 ur revoking Obama’s gun control bill ?  U use him incorrectly as an excuse when USA LAWS say it is the ATF that approves gun stocks. Not Obama. How’s it possible don’t know how the GOVERNMENT works? R u STUPID?  U shld RESIGN
#Liar
7871 2018-03-24 15:24:40 Bump stocks, seriously? That was only used in Vegas. That will barely change a thing. 
Because he is head of a Republican run house.
Because he has a meeting with the NRA and everything changes.
Because they gave him 30 mil during his campaign.

7875 2018-03-24 15:22:49 I dont think you're stupid, but you make a lot of stupid statements. I hated Obama,  but he didnt make bump stocks legal; they were always legal. And noone who shoots takes them seriously.  They are not accurate and jam.
7876 2018-03-24 15:22:47 Jail this villian assaulting democracy. Vile fascist. He should be flogged & put in the stocks for people to throw fruit & mud at him. Detestable undemocratic monster, enemy of America. Shameful in all extreme. Dangerous beyond words. To the stocks with Scott.
7877 2018-03-24 15:22:32 Do some research, Trump.  The Obama admin COULDN’T regulate bump stocks because of the language in the NFA.
7878 2018-03-24 15:22:28 i dunno he caved on bump stocks already...between that and the budget...bad day for magaheads yesterday

7883 2018-03-24 15:20:49 They’re not “Nationalists” either. More like deranged losers. Glad Trump banned Bump Stocks. Step in the right direction.
7884 2018-03-24 15:20:44 Oh please. Bump Stocks isn't the issue you orange faced twat! We need to reinstate the Assault Weapons Ban. We need mental health background checks (starting with you). We need longer waiting periods to buy a gun. We need to close the gun show loopholes. You need to RESIGN.

7889 2018-03-24 15:20:10 Obama made bump stocks legal. I personally believe they've been used in #FalseFlags in attempts to ban the AR15.
7890 2018-03-24 15:20:09 Since @realDonaldTrump is so simple minded, he’s becoming increasingly predictable. Throw out a tweet that will rile up the liberals so they don’t pay attention to the clusterfuck that is really happening. (#marchforourlives #StormySunday, stocks, Dowd)
7891 2018-03-24 15:19:47 Today is the March For Our Lives, yet tomorrow, nothing will change. The only change is that Trump is getting the DOJ to Officially Ban Bump Stocks, which is a product that I still can't believe was ever legal in the first place. But this March will change nothing. It never does.
7892 2018-03-24 15:19:20 Reading this tweet yesterday, thought it was a lie. After researching found that it is a lie. Obama did not legalize bump stocks, current law didn’t prohibit the sale of bump stocks. Your comprehension is limited, hopefully people have better critical thinking skills than you.
7893 2018-03-24 15:19:19 We are on the cusp of turning back the rising tide of gun violence with  Common Sense Gun Control in every  institution of American life Strong BG checks, raising the AL to 21 and banning bum stocks will not strip any lawful citizen of their 2nd amendment rights. #neveragain
7894 2018-03-24 15:19:10 Don’t forget the move to ban bump stocks and other accessories. Who is he trying to please? Or did he just want to do something anti Obama?
7895 2018-03-24 15:18:55 @davidhogg111 Do Not Trust @realDonaldTrump and his latest “ban bump stocks.” He sees you as a new voting block and is trying to reel you in
7896 2018-03-24 15:18:48 banning bump stocks is a good start. a universal gun check for gun purchases is  the next step. reasonable gun control is required. i support gun ownership but NOT assault weapons. must ban now #ArmsAreForHugging

7950 2018-03-24 15:16:44 @realDonaldTrump a ban on bump stocks is pure stupidity. It does NOT turn a semi-auto into full-auto. If you did your research you'd know this. Yes Vegas was tragic, but just because that idiot used one, doesn't mean they should be banned. You're pushing away voters for 2020.

7953 2018-03-24 15:15:27 God dam your a FKing liar! 

Obama issued EOs creating stricter controls (all of which Trump has rolled back), but could not legally restrict (non mechanical) bump stocks without new laws. Congress refused.
7954 2018-03-24 15:14:56 Nobody has to take up the job. Many gamekeepers report being expected to break the law to maintain grouse stocks. They could choose not to do this job. We have also contacted the "master" - the Duke of Rutland.
7955 2018-03-24 15:14:40 Literally, they want to ban AR-15's and the like. I have heard it many, many times from them. Bump stocks are apart of the second amendment. They are part of the word "arms". It doesn't say guns, it says arms.

7959 2018-03-24 15:13:57 @ValerieJarrett weren’t bump stocks legalized under the #ObamaAdmin?! Am I missing something here?
7960 2018-03-24 15:13:41 Those “legal weapons” are what have caused the majority of the school shootings! In Maryland we saw a hand gun be used to kill and in parkland bump stocks weren’t used to kill 17!

Me: “Huh. I actually agree with the proposed end result of this.”

Also Trump Yesterday: “I’m going to try and ban transgender folk from military service again.”

Me: “Can you just try to not be a dick for like...12 hours?”
7975 2018-03-24 15:10:54 Why don’t you ban all “machine guns”? Getting rid of bump stocks is a start— but ALL assault-style weapons need to go, as do high-capacity mags. NOBODY needs an assault weapon; NOBODY.

7977 2018-03-24 15:10:14 No they aren't. What are you afraid of? Think you won't pass a background check? Bump stocks aren't guns. And I'll tell you what tyranny is. It's hunting down kids in a school with a fucking AR-15. So stop whining
7978 2018-03-24 15:09:55 The ATF under Obama approved bump stocks, not because they liked it, but because the law did not permit them to prohibit it. Instead of this asshole pointing fingers at someone else, why doesn't he just lead and get it done.? 3 more years of this is going to kill me.
7979 2018-03-24 15:09:53 Would a lack of bump stocks and drum magazines have a meaningful effect on the Vegas shooting?  Sure would.
7980 2018-03-24 15:09:30 Mr Prez you are the man and I love you but this issue is such a red herring. Bump stocks are nothing but pieces of plastic. I have triggers that can shoot just as fast. This is like fat people blaming the fork. Guns and gun accessories are not the problem!
7981 2018-03-24 15:09:21 Do guns make society safer? This comes from perversion of 2nd Amendment:"security of a free State" but no one is protected when impetuous, unstable people can easily, cheaply access semi-automatic rifles, high-capacity magazines, bump stocks, killing en masse  #MarchForOurLives
7982 2018-03-24 15:09:14 He has.  Many times.  He came out for the banning of bump stocks after LV shooting.  He’s also been vocal for #GVRO and the tightening of #NICS reporting.  He’s doing what he can every day while not being a lawmaker.
7983 2018-03-24 15:08:49 Slowly but surely we are chipping away at your desire to kill schoolchildren. FL passed anti gun law, bump stocks now illegal, and more to come in 2020 with president Biden.

7986 2018-03-24 15:08:07 If you are going to buy or sell stocks based off of fear or hype from people on forums and twitter you shouldn’t be investing. Everyone has motives and it might be surprising to you, but it isn’t to make you money, it’s to make them money.
7987 2018-03-24 15:07:25 If you count future gun purchases and the current banning propaganda out there, then yes, their gun rights are being threatened. Also, in some states bump stocks are being banned and confiscated. So yes, their gun rights are being taken away due to this tyrannical propaganda.
7988 2018-03-24 15:07:23 Bump stocks is s "rule", not a law.  Just a lot of bull.
7989 2018-03-24 15:07:22 Common Sense Gun Control Includes IQ Test; Mental Health Exams, Fingerprinting, Psychiatric Exams, Universal Background Checks, Examining Peoples Social Media, Banning Of Bump Stocks, Raise The Age Of Gun Purchase To 21 And Ban Semi-Automatic Weapons #MarchForOurLives
7990 2018-03-24 15:07:00 Is there NO BLATANT LIE to which you will not stoop? You are the most dishonorable man to ever hold any public office. Obama’s gun ctrl EOs were never implemented by the GOP Congress. Bump stocks would have required new legislation. You still don’t know how the government works?
7991 2018-03-24 15:06:42 The 2nd Amendment was written about MUSKETs not AR15s and bump stocks. If you have to pass a test to get a drivers license - you should have to pass a background check to buy a gun - even a musket!

8037 2018-03-24 15:06:21 @realDonaldTrump While you re worrying about bump stocks, please keep in mind that Planned Parenthood is killing 3000 babies a day with tax payers money.
8038 2018-03-24 15:06:15 Dear @POTUS your bum ass ban on bump stocks doesn’t mean a damn thing. We want an all out ban on assault rifles and for the legal age to be able to purchase guns are raised to 21. The @nra maybe in your pocket but they aren’t in ours #MarchForOurLives #VoteThemOut #NeverAgain
8039 2018-03-24 15:06:15 "... Friday the Department of Justice issued the rule to ban bump stocks following through on the president's commitment to ban devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns" students marching and rallies are making a difference.
8040 2018-03-24 15:06:01 He has.  Kasich is for #GVRO, improving #NICS, and the banning of bump stocks — to name a few.  Suddenly Trump is for those exact same measures also.  Trump can see #Kasich2020 on the horizon. 
8041 2018-03-24 15:05:52 It is not about Russian explanation.
It is about May's statement "The only place where nerve agent could come from is Russia!" which was a reason to start discussion of sunctions. While 8 miles away from incident U.K. stocks the very same nerve agent. 
It's obvious.
#ukbot ?
8042 2018-03-24 15:05:40 And YOU are responsible for the downturn. "U.S. stocks suffered their worst week in more than two years, signaling mounting investor anxiety over whether factors from Trump restrictive trade policies to rising interest rates could disrupt the 9 yr bull market with 8 under Obama."
8043 2018-03-24 15:05:38 In 2010 the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives determined that because bump stocks don't have any moving parts, they are a "firearm part" and could not be regulated as a firearm under existing gun laws. The ATF reached a similar conclusion in 2012.
8044 2018-03-24 15:05:32 That's correct, OP. Trump did ban bump stocks. Good start. Now lets just abolish the #2ndAmendment
8045 2018-03-24 15:04:55 How will a black monday on stocks impact in crypto?
8046 2018-03-24 15:04:49 colonizing indonesia in style; dutch the 1st to invent a company (voc)with 'stocks' (so they tell me)
8047 2018-03-24 15:04:43 What I don’t hear anyone mentioning is that the far-right extremist assault weapon owners (aka NUTS) feel that they trully NEED their AR-15s, AK-47s, Bump-Stocks, etc., because it is the federal gov’t (thus the U. S. military) that they are “protecting” themselves against.
8048 2018-03-24 15:04:11 A ban on bump stocks would have reduced the severity of the Las Vegas shooting.  Same thing with banning high capacity magazines.
8049 2018-03-24 15:03:59 See, the rights to bear arms are already infringed through the ban of full-auto weapons. That's common sense right up there with banning bump stocks and high-cap clips. I'm a pretty big gun nut, but I don't think civilians should own them. But I agree, we are much less violent
8050 2018-03-24 15:03:23 No. You’re a liar. Obama could not make bump stocks illegal (congress would need to act) but he did make weapons of war more difficult to get and you rolled it back. Get off the NRAs talking points. You are a horrible person and president. Also, as I started. You are a LIAR.
8051 2018-03-24 15:03:09 How many times have silencers been used in mass shootings?! LMAO ok I'll give you bump stocks but guess what you can do the same thing as a bump stock with a piece of rope. Or build one on a 3D printer so what's the point of banning them. Other than politics
8052 2018-03-24 15:02:58 Companies drove the price of their stocks to get a better buy back price! Little guy are suckers!
8053 2018-03-24 15:02:54 Thanks @Target @AskTarget  (sarcasm). Wasted trip today - no advertised sale @dietpepsi bottles on the shelf and “we don’t give rain checks because the vendor stocks those”   It’s not the first time there isn’t been any but it’s my last - we are breaking up.
8054 2018-03-24 15:02:39 @jimcramer - Could the next risk to the market be a liquidity crisis with the massive proliferation of ETF's, ETN's, ETP's which all hold similar  equities? We saw hints of this during the 2015 ETF flash crash. Top 10 stocks in $DIA and $SPY dictate the indices.
8055 2018-03-24 15:02:27 Ask your pension fund managers to get out of stocks of assault gun manufacturers. Thanks
8056 2018-03-24 15:01:42 In 2010 the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives determined that because bump stocks don't have any moving parts, they are a "firearm part" and could not be regulated as a firearm under existing gun laws. The ATF reached a similar conclusion in 2012.
8057 2018-03-24 15:01:38 Trump literally just banned the sale of bump stocks, something @BarackObama never had the nads to do
8058 2018-03-24 15:00:57 After saying I would not touch their guns, I have decided to ban bump stocks. My base won't say anything negative about it though because I'm also banning transgender people from the military! #WINNING #MAGA
8059 2018-03-24 15:00:35 Liar!!  Obama DID NOT legalize bump stocks..  The law did not allow Obama to prohibit bump stocks.  If congress wanted to regulate them they could have. Bump stocks weren't considered an issue until after the Vegas shootings.
8060 2018-03-24 15:00:28 Simple answers to complex problems.  I’m sure Obama loved bump stocks!
8061 2018-03-24 15:00:23 Per month? Fuck wunna feel the child gon go? Buy stocks?
8062 2018-03-24 15:00:04 Oh wow my stock twits app posts are getting automatically posted on Twitter. Install stock twits , this app is really amazing for trading stocks
8063 2018-03-24 14:59:56 False, they have only made sure our current laws are followed. And added bump stocks
8064 2018-03-24 14:59:55 I'm working at a gun show today. First thing the promoter says over the intercom is "they just passed legislation to ban bump stocks, if you don't think they're coming for your guns, you're wrong" they don't want "your" guns. But we should think about taking his away.
8065 2018-03-24 14:59:54 Stocks go up stocks go down you can’t explain that
8066 2018-03-24 14:59:53 All Medicaid does is fit the bill for what would be a Self-Pay that wasn't going to pay anyway! Take it from Bankrupt Benny; Played the stocks, thought I saw a Bear trap and stumbled into a Bull Ring!
8067 2018-03-24 14:59:39 Seeing lots of leading stocks right at 100dma. Could be a great entry if there's a bounce.
8068 2018-03-24 14:59:32 Senator Eaton.  I listened to your speech and other PC senators.   Too much ignorance on the issue.  If you and other senators where to invest in MJ stocks, your research/knowledge would be up to date. “Just pure ignorance”.  Do your home work Madame.
8069 2018-03-24 14:59:15 Not aware of bump stocks being used in any school shooting,  but thanks for the worthless gesture........
8070 2018-03-24 14:59:05 No, you regulate when it’s an obvious and significant public risk/hazard. There is zero evidence that demonstrates regulating bump stocks for instance would have stopped any shooting. But of course ppl who know nothing about guns are ready to regulate them!
8071 2018-03-24 14:58:57 To use the faulty NRA logic, laws against bump stocks won't accomplish anything because criminals won't care if they are breaking the law. The only way to stop a bad guy with a bump stock is a good guy with a bump stock.
8072 2018-03-24 14:57:59 I don't normally support you, but bump stocks should be illegal.
8073 2018-03-24 14:57:50 NOPE.ATF had no authority to regulate bump stocks. Wanted to regulate, couldn’t.Change law & ban them. You signed repeal of Obama’s rule giving BCS access to SSA data re mental health benefits.Republicons were passing bill legalizing silencers week of Vegas shooting. NRA owns you
8074 2018-03-24 14:57:37 Tesla chick likes dancing with fire . My failed call last year was investing in movie stocks believing public sentiment would change by this time. So wrong! The new Star Wars made things worse.
8075 2018-03-24 14:57:04 Anyone that thinks that an investment in Bitcoin is gambling BUT a small portfolio of individual stocks is NOT gambling is deluding themselves.
8076 2018-03-24 14:56:36 My take on the cloud act is that Trump need info on servers in other countries to fight the cabal and this just made it easier. Not sure about bump stocks yet... probably an easy target to get Dems to sign.
8077 2018-03-24 14:56:24 If trade war continues and if China sells US bonds as retaliation, the dollar would crash, interest rates would go up and stocks would plunge. Hope not, but possible.
8078 2018-03-24 14:56:21 The justice dept. suggests a ban on bump stocks...

Let me just add to that; IT'S NOT ENOUGH!

#BanAssaultWeapons #TheNRAisaterroristorganization 

Fuck the @NRA it's a parasitic organisation.

8079 2018-03-24 14:56:15 Thank you, Jon. Should I leave all the deflated stocks as they are, hoping for them to come back up again, from deflation? Thanks, again
8080 2018-03-24 14:56:12 @realDonaldTrump Lead from behind, get no credit for the good results; the bad results all belong to you, Doll Hands. Don't talk about bump-stocks or other measures by the NRA that attempt to paper over this cancer, real action is required. Fish or cut bait.
8081 2018-03-24 14:55:27 Former President Obama didn’t allow the sales of bump stocks they were classified as an item that couldn’t not regulated by the ATF.
8082 2018-03-24 14:55:24 WH statement on #MarchForOurLives "...and signed them into law. Additionally, on Friday, the Department of Justice issued the rule to ban bump stocks following through on the President's comment to ban devices that urn legal weapons into illegal machine guns."
8083 2018-03-24 14:55:20 Your comment is reasonable yet unlike your comment those in the Dem Lib world don’t see tighter gun regs as the answer Simply they want bans Whats truly disgusting is they care not for children’s safety just using them as a tool now. ie bump stocks kept legal under 8yrs of Obama.
8084 2018-03-24 14:55:04 67% of Americans support an assault weapons ban. We can also ban modifications like ‘bump stocks’ and silencers which make guns deadlier in mass-shooting situations. #AmericansAgree #MarchForOurLives
8085 2018-03-24 14:55:01 Congress just denied banning bump stocks. They don’t want to raise age limit for rifles. They don’t want to lower mag capacities. They refuse to ban assault-type weapons. We need more laws!
8086 2018-03-24 14:54:38 I don't give a crap about bump stocks they were only used one time in a mass shooting that has long been swept under the rug because things didn't add up
8087 2018-03-24 14:54:01 Again, lying! Listening to those voices in your head! You rolled back Obama’s tighter grip on bump stocks. Do you lie on purpose for your kool aid drinkers or are you really that stupid??
8088 2018-03-24 14:53:55 @realDonaldTrump REAL NEWS
"U.S. stocks suffered their worst week in more than two years, over restrictive trade policies." (WSJ)
"Aides said there was no grand strategy to the president’s actions, and that he got up each morning this week not knowing what he would do." NYT
8089 2018-03-24 14:53:41 @FoxNews calls themselves a news channel but they aren't covering the @AMarch4OurLives movement. They are talking stocks. Fox News is and always will be a fucking joke. Shame on you. Agree with the movement or not, news is news. Cowards.
#March4OurLives
8090 2018-03-24 14:53:35 Why can you ever get facts straight???  Obama did not "legalize" bump stocks, his administration did clarify that they were not subject to regulation.
8091 2018-03-24 14:53:26 I knew a guy who is now passed away who had millions in one stock. It was one of those stocks that kept splitting over the decades and then walla. Lost almost everything when WalMart moved in. This one guy refused to diversify and became too sentiment with a possession.
8092 2018-03-24 14:53:23 A rose by any other name, a lie is a lie, your lips are moving. The sad thing is there are those who will believe you. Ban all assault weapons as well as bump stocks.
8093 2018-03-24 14:52:56 How about banning legal guns that are killing more people than illegal guns with bump stocks??? #AssaultWeaponsBan #guncontrol #MarchForOurLivesdc #gunviolence #GunReformNow ##GunSafety #marchforourlivessydney
8094 2018-03-24 14:52:16 Hi Tweeps! Made a lot of money in stocks again yesterday - as a general rule of thumb any consecutive-day drop over 1,000 in the Dow is very good news for me! No #PremierLeague this weekend so may play golf tomorrow!
8095 2018-03-24 14:52:15 No offense to the people marching but try to be a bit more educated. Most school shootings are done with a handgun and the president is making bump stocks ,which turn pretty much any weapon into an automatic, illegal. Plus stop bullying people.
8096 2018-03-24 14:51:04 Haven't seen Peter Schweitzer's new book have you. While Obama placed bone crushing regulations on the coal industry, their stocks bottomed out. Obama & his friends bought those stocks at .10 on the dollar.  Hmmm. How corrupt is that?
8097 2018-03-24 14:50:21 I'm invested in alcohol stocks. I need y'all to party harder
8098 2018-03-24 14:50:20 4) No assault rifles or bump stocks. No magazines holding with more than ten rounds. No open carry. Must demonstrate valid reason for concealed carry ("because I want to" is not a valid reason). Must requalify on training and safety quals every 3-5 years.
8099 2018-03-24 14:50:10 What do you do if you lose 88% of your 20 different stocks that you had in the last 5 days?
8100 2018-03-24 14:49:59 How about signing a gun control reform package that protects our National Security and our kids.  Ban on assault weapons, minimum age to buy gun, ban bump stocks, ban on line sales of guns, universal background checks on all gun sales, no fly-no by. #MarchForOurLives
8101 2018-03-24 14:49:52 All the bump stock is is a spring that you put on the butt of your rifle to make it simulate an auto. It is not automatic. Banning bump stocks is stupid. So terribly stupid.

8103 2018-03-24 14:49:40 I was forced to eat Kettle Crisps tonight because the bottle shop only stocks Kettle crisps and and not Red Rock Deli. I could have gone to Wollies, but the owner of the bottle shop makes me go all unnecessary.
8104 2018-03-24 14:48:58 I have always written stuff that I had hoped would be long-lived. The same is true about stocks and bonds: observations are meant to provide long term guidance. These periods of the arrival of high volatility have always been randomly modelled in finance literature

8106 2018-03-24 14:47:53 As a life long hunter, I want to thank you, because bump stocks have no place in our society.  Thank you again!
8107 2018-03-24 14:47:36 I don't see incedible.FL legislature has re-introduced guns in schools, deprived adults of rights (18 yr olds vote & get drafted/serve mil), banned bump stocks about to be banned by feds, raised tax burden for police/mh, & doesn't harden schools through physical and tech security
8108 2018-03-24 14:47:29 If GOP cant reduce the debt when unemployment is LOW and stocks are high, you NEVER will.
8109 2018-03-24 14:47:27 The administration seems to be very proud of banning "Bump stocks"
Way to pat yourselves on the back for doing the absolute MINIMUM that you can do #MarchForOurLives
8110 2018-03-24 14:47:21 This little trace war with China fucking my stocks allll the way up
8111 2018-03-24 14:46:56 White House issues statement to ban bump stocks , yet a bump stock was not used in one of the school shootings!!!  Yet All the school shooting were committed by someone under 21, that might be a good starting point.
8112 2018-03-24 14:46:51 Good weekend to search for relative strength in individual stocks and sectors [If you can find it], especially if you think a bounce in the markets might come next week. It can't hurt to be prepared just in case.
8113 2018-03-24 14:46:50 Trump and Sessions say bump stocks will soon be gone so school shooting issue solved.   You high school kids can now go back to video games and skate boards and stop protesting. Wait Sessions thinks video games worse than guns.
8114 2018-03-24 14:46:40 There are approximately 35,000 gun deaths per year. Around 3000 are kids and teenagers. Guess how many of these would could be prevented by “banning bump stocks?” Approximately zero. Banning bump stocks is fine but it’s basically do-nothing bullshit.
8115 2018-03-24 14:46:29 Another lie Pres Birther. The law is that any gun that requires trigger action to release a round is legal. Bump stocks release one round per trigger pull.The AG was right on the law. Stand up to the NRA and change the law.Apologize for the Birther lie.
8116 2018-03-24 14:46:26 Momentum based Investing focuses on buying stocks which hv outperformed with no regard for underlying fundamentals. When market turns down, volume of selling increases significantly, as not only the current flow needs to be sold but all the accumulated stock on the way up as well

8160 2018-03-24 14:44:02 FACTS:  Legal experts stressed that Obama DID NOT APPROVE bump stocks,  but rather the law passed by Congress didn’t allow for its regulation.

Obama issued a slew of executive orders promoting stricter gun control, which the Trump administration has been rolling back.
8161 2018-03-24 14:43:46 Hey Congress is the NRA more important than re-election, is your job more important than bump stocks,  is your political future more important than an AR-15? Are the lives of your constituents children more important than YOU in Congress? Better think again!
8162 2018-03-24 14:43:44 And you know how I am with guns. Bump stocks just aren’t needed. I can shoot my AR fast enough for what I need without one.
8163 2018-03-24 14:43:02 As interest rates rise, it's a good time to short on all stocks.
8164 2018-03-24 14:42:53 Still lying like a rug.  Your ban will be court challenged and won't pass muster. That is what Obama admin ran into. Bump stocks were not "legalized" by anyone but couldn't be banned because of existing law. If U never read and only watch Fox U will always look stupid.

8168 2018-03-24 14:42:24 Also, people can make automatic and semi-automatic weapons using bump stocks.
8169 2018-03-24 14:42:23 Banning bump stocks is literally the least Trump could do. And that’s all he did. Coward. Liar. #MarchForOurLives

8173 2018-03-24 14:40:19 I get what you saying and it’s true. But in the last 30 days trump has gone after video games, bump stocks(gun control) and now the shit with yesterday. Obviously I still support him but if he doesn’t get his shit together I’ll be voting for a real conservative next election.

8175 2018-03-24 14:40:14 The beginning, the kids have already gotten Trump and Sessions to ban bump stocks....the NRA is out of touch !
8176 2018-03-24 14:40:08 Bump stocks have zero to do with the 2A. That Is a gun accessory that changes a domestic single-fire weapon to a weapon that only belongs on a battlefield. Your right to own a gun as a mentally stable, law abiding citizen will never change.
8177 2018-03-24 14:39:56 Wow, what a bunch of BS! 1st, bump stocks have been around/used long before Obama. 2nd, ATF can not create law only interpret it. They did NOT 'legalize' bump stocks, only determined, bcus it has no moving parts, it's a firearm PART which they do NOT have authority to regulate...

8180 2018-03-24 14:39:15 Ill informed? I have dozens of family members who are NRA and I know them intimately. They oppose any, any common sense gun laws. No age limits, no limits on bump stocks, NO LIMITS. The NRA promotes fear..that's what I call a terrorist organization.
8181 2018-03-24 14:38:44 What about my ARs? The pistol is simply what I had with me.
Quit your whining about bump stocks. I can get the same effect with my index finger.
8182 2018-03-24 14:38:36 “In 2010 the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives determined that because bump stocks don't have any moving parts, they are a "firearm part" and could not be regulated as a firearm under existing gun laws. The ATF reached a similar conclusion in 2012”.
8183 2018-03-24 14:38:32 Lmao banning bump stocks would have saved how many students in these shootings? 0?
8184 2018-03-24 14:38:31 We March bc we are tired of our lawmakers not acting when it comes to gun violence. Banning bump stocks means nothing when the majority of the shootings result from AR 15 style guns. Our lives are more important than your guns! #MarchForOurLives #NeverAgain #Votethemout
8185 2018-03-24 14:38:12 Do you realize how many people and businesses you will destroy by banning slide stocks? Inaddition  the bomber in Austin Texas didn't  use an ar15 nor a bump stock  a bump stock is merely a piece of plastic your finger does all the work are you going to ban fingers?
8186 2018-03-24 14:37:58 This was not a bill, the President is NOT required to send a DIME to PP...what has this to do with answering to God so that I back the President on what he does..bump stocks were already banned, Obama allowed them back in..Don't say I'm sinning by backing this President..

Money from the NRA or the lives of NCians that you swore under oath to fight for? 2A is still protected if universal background checks and assault wep bans passed, bump stocks only the beginning.
8189 2018-03-24 14:37:22 Trump tweets his move to ban bump stocks but fails to add that whilst he’s at it he’ll ban transgenders in the military as well....let’s just sneak that in...@realDonaldTrump

8197 2018-03-24 14:36:23 Strong criminal and mental health background checks are needed consistently across my country. Bump stocks and assault rifles no longer available
8198 2018-03-24 14:36:17 @realDonaldTrump Ban Bump stocks? There is a need, you know.  It seems Sen. Schumer heard a crazy man using a Bump Stock killed 56 people.  “I will ban Bump Stocks!” he said “Just in case one of the 10 MILLION legal AR-15 owners goes crazy someday and kills 56 more people."
8199 2018-03-24 14:36:03 You know this is a trick by the far-left Democrats trying to make you compromise some of their gun-control agenda, right? Bump Stocks don't kill people, evil people and people using Big Pharma's opioids kill people. Go after Big Pharma instead PLEASE! Thank you!
8200 2018-03-24 14:35:57 How did that bump stocks thing Trump said he was going to ban go?

8203 2018-03-24 14:35:26 Donald Trump declaring he'll ban bump-stocks yesterday is a joke. It's not supported by existing law and it'll be struck down by the courts.

He and the GOP have made no effort to buck the NRA.

#MarchForOurLives today. And march to the voting booth on November 6.
8204 2018-03-24 14:34:38 Do you want to answer to God for your money going to Abortions? I don't!  Fact is our voted officials funded planned parenthood. And banning bump stocks. I'm Angry but will not Sin!
8205 2018-03-24 14:33:48 Today would be a great day for @TIAA to divest all gun stocks from retirement funds they manage for  #TEACHers and #EDUcators. #MarchForOurLives
8206 2018-03-24 14:33:39 Sorry, Sparky. PRESIDENT Obama did NOT legalize bump stocks. Might be a good idea to read the Constitution, but that would require skills you don’t possess. What a pathetic little man you are!
8207 2018-03-24 14:33:20 It's a good day because among other things, the flower man in town had STOCKS.
8208 2018-03-24 14:32:41 Energy stocks capture interest.
8209 2018-03-24 14:32:32 Who cares about bump stocks? They're a cheap gimmick. And Trump passing that bill I really think was for the military. If he hadn't, the soldiers wouldn't be paid. We need to do everything to avoid gov't shutdowns. The only truly bad news is that our fashy goyette Taylor Swift...
8210 2018-03-24 14:32:05 Unfortunately, criminals don't care about any law. They will have bump-stocks and you won't. Think about that before giving up your rights.
8211 2018-03-24 14:31:55 Honestly the drive will suck, if I end up coming I’d put stocks on
8212 2018-03-24 14:31:49 Bump stocks to not turn legal weapons into machine guns, period.
8213 2018-03-24 14:31:28 Since when do you want to do anything Obama did!?!That should give you all the more reason to make a CHANGE NOW!Gun reform is a MUST! Not just bump stocks but all assault rifles banned!Limit magazines! Change NOW take a stand DJT and don’t be like Obama! #MarchForOurLivesdc

8220 2018-03-24 14:30:46 Liar. The Obama Administration did not “legalize” bump stocks.
8221 2018-03-24 14:30:45 "First they came for the bump stocks, and I said nothing, because I only had an AR-15" is an actual, sincere comment I just saw on Facebook
8222 2018-03-24 14:30:44 I hope there's no grandfather clause regarding the "bump stocks", it needs to be a federal offense to possess one now.
8223 2018-03-24 14:29:49 #walk for outlives Today is the day to make it known that gun control is a must. We have been a country of leadership but in this area we fall short. 21 age limit. Background checks for all gun sales. No AR15 type guns. No bump stocks.
8224 2018-03-24 14:28:42 Personally, I don't care about bump stocks either way.
Although I don't like the idea of banning them, I'm a little less bothered by this route - at least they're not tagging on a dozen other bans, like many states are doing.
8225 2018-03-24 14:27:32 We have an offset mortgage so I wouldn't pay it off but wouldn't be paying interest either 

It would be great to get back to fully offset... Would then pile into stocks and shares ISA
8226 2018-03-24 14:27:29 And if you really believe that these bump stocks and any other products to convert guns to semi automatic weapons won’t be bought and sold because you say so, your dreaming
8227 2018-03-24 14:27:01 Bump stocks which Trump is banning, came about because of proliferation of auto machine guns during unconstitutional prohibition, and their ban at end of prohibition in the National Firearms Act. Gov illegit action is what got us to this point; more illegitimacy is not the answer
8228 2018-03-24 14:27:00 As a liberal progressive, I'm not coming for your guns today. I understand the Constitution. I do however, think bump stocks need to go, high capacity magazines gone, 5 round magazines max. Background checks mandatory, let's register, seize & punish for illegal transfer.
8229 2018-03-24 14:26:48 $ADAP was our stock of the week last week and it was up 4% for the week in a weak market but hit an intra-week high of 12.21  $AOI was our pick before $ADAP and it was up 11%.  $BZUN was our pick before $AOI and it was up 10%  The stocks of the week have been on fire

Now is the time to ban military-style weapons like AR-15s and dangerous accessories like bump stocks #MarchForOurLives

8233 2018-03-24 14:25:07 You start with a lie (Obama did not legalize bump stocks, they were never illegal according to law). Then you announce a DOJ rule change that will almost definitely be challenged in court by the NRA. A challenge they will probably win. Push Congress to change the law or shut up.
8234 2018-03-24 14:24:39 1/8 I do NOT support the banning of bump-stocks just like I do NOT support the current ban on fully automatic weapons made after 1986. The 2nd Amendment is NOT for the sake of sport. It's for the sake of feasibly putting down tyrants.
8235 2018-03-24 14:24:34 Hes to busy taking our 2a rights away as Trump grandstands about it,is Trump mincing words knowing bump stocks can't be banned by ATF unless new language appears?Or is he sliding us down the oil slicked road of gun confiscation & or future bans? This is why I'm against the  ban.
8236 2018-03-24 14:24:04 Too bad DT you are not factual.  Obama Admin never legalized bump stocks. DOJ can't ban Bump Stocks, another error. Do the right thing, tell Congress to ban the AR-15, simple. Lying is no longer acceptable. But don't worry about that. Keep tweeting lies.
8237 2018-03-24 14:22:50 That's weird, I  think of the NRA and all those crazies that have AR-15s and bump stocks as the violent radicals.
8238 2018-03-24 14:22:29 i've made up my choice..but now to see which branch stocks the most.
8239 2018-03-24 14:22:21 LMAO--right. Keep teling urself that. Guns don't shoot themselves and there is no way there is going to be a gun grab in America so what is happening is a waste of time. Who cares about bump stocks? I agree w/some reform, but it's ultimately the person who commits the crime.

8241 2018-03-24 14:21:57 Sessions is moving toward a federal ban on bump stocks. That's fine Jeff, a small step in the right direction. But Nikolas Cruz didn't use a bump stock. #BanAssaultWeapons #MarchForOurLives
8242 2018-03-24 14:21:41 Who said “bump stocks” were part of that?  You can have your guns but no one said you can have incremental devices making them even more lethal.  You can’t just create what ever youn want and call it protected under the 2nd.  There needs to be common sense.

8246 2018-03-24 14:19:57 This is a lie. 

The Obama administration didn't legalize bump stocks. 

Obama issued EOs creating stricter controls (ALL of which YOU HAVE ROLLED BACK), but could not legally restrict (non mechanical) bump stocks without new laws. GOP Congress refused.
8247 2018-03-24 14:19:16 It's never good when as an investor you think it's time to sell everything except your defense stocks...  dark times ahead with Mr. Bolton and Mr. Pompeo... time sell stocks having to do with friends (Facebook) and family (Disney)... and buy the stocks of war.  Scary Scary times
8248 2018-03-24 14:19:09 You lying SOB - Congress had not made a law that would prohibit BUMP STOCKS.  Obama didn't approve this because he liked it, but because he couldn't prohibit it,  USE FACTS!! A HALF-TRUTH is the Same. As. A. LIE!!  Obama was a eloquent, truthful president. You are NOT.

8252 2018-03-24 14:18:01 @BarackObama do you believe you should explain why your administration approved bump stocks to begin with? Why, after Sandy Hook, would your administration approve these deadly gun modifiers?
8253 2018-03-24 14:17:28 @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump u passed a bill that funds the murder of children and your worried about bump stocks and gun control????

8256 2018-03-24 14:16:39 It's funny how people just want to get rid of bump stocks and ONE type of semi-automatic rifle and think that's going to solve these shootings. How about we solve the underlying issues first? Let's start with bullying and bad influences! #MarchForOurLives #Enough
8257 2018-03-24 14:16:19 Oh and #ForFactsSake bump stocks were being sold. Obama tried to get atf to help ban them. Atf stated they cannot. Enuf of your lies.
8258 2018-03-24 14:15:30 I’ve tried giving @realDonaldTrump the benefit of the doubt. Signing the omnibus spending bill, and support for banning bump stocks has pushed me over the limit. #Nosecondterm #goodbyeGOP

8260 2018-03-24 14:14:51 Bump stocks aren’t the problem. A.R. 15’s on the streets of America are the problem and the easy access to getting them to shoot people
8261 2018-03-24 14:14:08 My current take on #guncontrol:
1. I agree with universal background checks.
2. I agree with raising the minimum age for gun ownership to 21.
3. I agree with banning bump stocks & similar enhancements that make semiautomatic guns fully automatic.
8262 2018-03-24 14:14:06 Sweet, so you think bump stocks should be legal!
8263 2018-03-24 14:13:54 Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.
8264 2018-03-24 14:13:54 @christyNHC you have no clue about finance or stocks and just repeat your same bs.  Stormy Daniels affects stocks? What a crock moron
8265 2018-03-24 14:13:05 No they didn't you lying clown - bump stocks have no moving parts and were therefore not able to be regulated under any existing laws.  If you try to ban them through executive order now, your own base will beat your ass in court.
8266 2018-03-24 14:12:55 You can ban the bump Stocks but I can still bump fire with my finger, there is no point of this but I get it. Make them feel like your giving them something when it solve nothing🖒
8267 2018-03-24 14:12:34 I am a weapons advocate, but frankly I can pull a trigger pretty fast if I want to... bump stocks just take the work out of it.  The problem is the break down of the nuclear family, the lack of parenting (discipline) because parents will go to jail, and the lack of God in the USA
8268 2018-03-24 14:12:27 Outlaw "Bump Stocks"?  Really?  @realDonaldTrump - are you going to require gun owners to cut off their thumbs and belt loops next?  If you don't know what I'm talking about, do your homework.......  Major blow for Americans, the Constitution and your re-election hopes for 2020.
8269 2018-03-24 14:12:12 So you're against Trump's ignorant position on guns like his ban on bump stocks?
8270 2018-03-24 14:12:04 Bump stocks will not operate w/o pressure, which means human element must be combined for bump stocks to function. 
AGAIN, the issue continues to prove the human element with firearms is the problem, not guns
I support firearms, 2A, NRA & Bump stocks
8271 2018-03-24 14:11:49 Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.
8272 2018-03-24 14:11:35 I am truly wondering. I’m not going to try to predict what he will or will not say. I am open to possibility.  I was encouraged by his action yesterday to commit to banning the bump stocks.
8273 2018-03-24 14:11:11 Just laughing at ur tweets now wi  Pete now in stocks sounds like u dodged a silver bullet last night 
8274 2018-03-24 14:11:09 Yes.  It actually makes me very comfortable in understanding the debits and credits and following the flows and stocks.  I can't imagine understanding this stuff without a deep understanding of Income Stments, Balance Sheets, and cashflows.
8275 2018-03-24 14:10:15 Market is under pressure. Watch stocks that hold up like champs and do not give back much / recover very quickly.
8276 2018-03-24 14:10:14 Obama didn't legalize bump stocks. The manufacturer told the ATF in 2010 the product was "intended to assist persons whose hands have limited mobility." The ATF determined it was a "firearm part" and thus could not regulate it under the Gun Control Act or National Firearms Act.
8277 2018-03-24 14:10:09 Rick Vasquez, a former ATF official who took part in the decision to approve bump stocks, told Politifact that to blame the administration implies that Obama or his then-attorney general Eric Holder were involved in the determination.
8278 2018-03-24 14:09:46 Hey IDIOT! Bump Stocks had nothing to do with the shootings in Parkland or many of these other mass shootings. The assault rifles and your Alt-Right American Born terrorist are the problem.
8279 2018-03-24 14:09:45 How many of the mass murderers have used bump stocks? One?
8280 2018-03-24 14:09:40 Bump stocks are the one thing the NRA indicated they would agree to eliminate. Not a huge feat for you.
8281 2018-03-24 14:09:36 I'd have to guess that the Vasoline stocks will reach record highs
8282 2018-03-24 14:09:35 @RiseOfFoles @FolesFootlong Trump will ban bump stocks that the Obama Administration made legal on 2 occasions and this idiot has a resist flag? Can they got in same page what they are even protesting smh.
8283 2018-03-24 14:09:14 Not the guns.  Banning bump stocks doesn’t change a person if they have bad intentions.  Wake up America.

8327 2018-03-24 14:07:45 every CIVILIZED country in the world has better gun laws than ours, and their citizens don't worry about gun violence. I'm all for mental health care improvements as well, but for example the  Vegas shooter had no history of mental illness. and they are about to ban bump stocks
8328 2018-03-24 14:07:36 Nobody wants to take your stupid guns away. Stop pushing that agenda. We want to end bump stocks and not allow regular day citizens to obtain assault rifles & stronger background and mental health checks. You can keep your little hand guns / pistols. #THEBLUEWAVE is coming!
8329 2018-03-24 14:07:29 At this juncture I am buying the dip -- with inflationary stocks. Playing an expected range, with hedges: 
Events that would make me far more bearish: 
US leaves the WTO,
Military conflict,
ECB / BOJ suspending QE,
US yield curve inversion. 
Complete bond breakdown.
8330 2018-03-24 14:07:22 It is accurate to say the Obama administration approved the sale of bumps stocks. 
"Not because they liked it, but because the law did not permit them to prohibit it," So get your facts straight mr.pres.
8331 2018-03-24 14:07:14 How many war machine stocks do you own or are funding by??

@LindseyGrahamSC
8332 2018-03-24 14:07:12 D: Get rid of assault rifles

R: See, there’s your problem. I can’t take anyone seriously who calls them “assault rifles”

D: Fine. Get rid of bump stocks and semi-automatic rifles with 30-round magazines

R: No

#MarchForOurLives
8333 2018-03-24 14:06:47 @Virginia Foxx As your pediatrician constituent from Ashe county URGING you to fund gun violence prevention research and ban assault weapons and bump stocks. 74 kids are KILLED or INJURED by guns EVERY day in the USA. Please act NOW
8334 2018-03-24 14:06:19 Bear has got vix,libor, 10 years treasury yeild, high pe on stocks , breakdown on charts, low and anenemic earning, and so on, everyone depending on stock market for earning . May be having the upper end
8335 2018-03-24 14:05:48 Not true.  The Obama administration determined that two of the bump stocks were not mechanical devices and therefore could not be regulated.  Get your facts right instead of spreading fake news
8336 2018-03-24 14:05:16 Trump did ban bumb stocks.

Obama didn't. 

#MarchForOurLives
8337 2018-03-24 14:04:38 Bump stocks are a joke. This is a waste of time. Parkland shooter didn’t have one, and no one has show actual proof that the Vegas shooter used one. Further MD Shooter proved everything 2A supporters have been saying.
8338 2018-03-24 14:04:28 The determined teens protesting 4 gun ctrl really got U scared, huh?
Arming citizenry doesn't take guns away from criminals; only teaches each side to up the ante. Background checks, closing gun sale loopholes & banning bump stocks reduces gun carnage on our streets.
8339 2018-03-24 14:04:23 Bump stocks are a red herring. BUT, having carried the Mil version as an infantry officer in Vietnam I know for a FACT I can fire it on semi at ~120 per min. You get GOOD at mag changes and ours only held 20. If that’s not enough to take down a deer, go bowling.
8340 2018-03-24 14:04:06 That's fine.. No place for Bump stocks here.. Thanks POTUS #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
8341 2018-03-24 14:03:06 The Justice Dept. has proposed banning so-called bump stocks for guns. The move came a day before nationwide gun control marches.
8342 2018-03-24 14:03:04 Do you look for every possible  reasons to enter in stocks?
8343 2018-03-24 14:02:39 I have some stock screen I only run one time per week. The best of them is: #Stocks which gained at least 10%. So simple but so good.
8344 2018-03-24 14:02:27 Big fat fuzzy deal.  #45 decided to ban bump stocks on the day millions of people will march for gun control.  This is the best he has to offer at the 11th hour.  What a schmuck.
8345 2018-03-24 14:02:14 That's just a lie.  The ATF determined bump stocks were legal under existing law and Obama concluded that he couldn't make them illegal because of the Republican majority in Congress.  You must really think the people are stupid.
8346 2018-03-24 14:02:08 Bump stocks do NOT make a semi automatic rifle a machine gun you ding dong. I can do the same thing with my belt loop. It’s called bump firing.
8347 2018-03-24 14:02:00 Bump stocks have never been regulated as the ATF decided they were not a firearm; they’re a toy for guns. Obama could not legalize them nor restrict them.
8348 2018-03-24 14:00:25 There’s nothing you can do about Bump Stocks. Nice try though.
8349 2018-03-24 14:00:00 Nagkaimpact kaya sa stocks Ma'am?
8350 2018-03-24 14:00:00 Who’s buying marijuana stocks?  What company’s ya’ll watching?
8351 2018-03-24 13:59:20 In the grand scheme of things I could care less about 'bump stocks!' Non-issue.
8352 2018-03-24 13:58:42 Banning sliding stocks is that BS. 
#THATSISALL
8353 2018-03-24 13:55:47 So happy to see that bump stocks are likely on the chopping block. I hope it’s the first domino to fall of the many.
8354 2018-03-24 13:55:29 Look at energy stocks charts though. Xom, xle.  Woof
8355 2018-03-24 13:55:10 @EoECoop is there a reason why the Co-op on Woodbridge Road East no longer stocks basic things like lettuce? it is sooo frustrating going into that shop and everything I want is either out of stock, or they no longer sell it.
8356 2018-03-24 13:55:09 How many stocks should be in a portfolio?
8357 2018-03-24 13:55:06 Bump stocks cause the trigger to be pulled multiple times while you merely hold your finger in position. You can be against banning bump stocks but that doesn't change the fact they only require shooter to pull the trigger once and hold flexed  finger position to empty a magazine
8358 2018-03-24 13:53:55 Bump stocks and semi automatic hmm might work?
8359 2018-03-24 13:53:46 I honestly don't recommend it.
All of the zytel101 stocks had issues. 
Much better stuff available today.
8360 2018-03-24 13:53:33 As @Emma4Change and #MSDStrong say "We call BS". Mr. Obama's administration didn't "legalize" bump stocks, they just COULD NOT ban sales/manufacture based on current law. So your comment is just FAKE NEWS.
8361 2018-03-24 13:52:42 Obama made Bump stocks legal.  Trump banned them.  Media silent
8362 2018-03-24 13:52:17 Ignore the tips, advices and do research on the annual reports, financials, management, products, geography, regulations etc. to pick and stick to fundamental value &/or growth stocks!
8363 2018-03-24 13:52:07 Some of you are tweeting me, asking for my comments on crypto. I will make an effort to write up a post about why I think it's not worth my time (with some possible rare exceptions) but I also really want to write a post on the FANG stocks and facebook in particular.
8364 2018-03-24 13:52:02 That's good news. But we just stayed at Woburn and we still got served with plastic bendi straws and small blacks straws in some drinks
Hope this is just your remaining stocks being used.
8365 2018-03-24 13:51:37 Di lagi kami maubusan ng stocks ng pagkain dito sa bahay? Nung tuesday pa to ba haha
8366 2018-03-24 13:51:24 Number one..it's an AR15..and whether you realize it or not..assault rifles have been banned for decades. As for bump stocks, I believe those became the thing during Obama's tenure, and Trump said they're on the chopping block..and our greatest threat isn't guns..its nutcases.
8367 2018-03-24 13:51:21 Thanks . Seems microcap will hv lot of pain in this conditions, SIP on weekly basis might help on fundamental strong stocks
8368 2018-03-24 13:50:40 Donald signed the bill and Bump Stocks and automatic fire mods to assault type weapons are now illegal in one day. Then he went to Mar a Largo to lay somebody. Oops forgot the p. Bad day for Tea Party conservatives.
8369 2018-03-24 13:48:50 What stocks are you Long? Also on the vix - are you saying vix goes down from here? Or that it needs to go higher to confirm bottom? Or the fact it didn’t go higher confirms bottom?
8370 2018-03-24 13:48:26 reacting like most other stocks, could be headed for a retest of the 200dsma, still no guarantees at that level either.  I'll step aside and let the dust settle.
8371 2018-03-24 13:48:03 FORGET BUMP STOCKS AND ALL SHENANIGANS TO SWITCH CONVERSATION AWAY FROM COLLUSION, ,HOW MUCH MONEY DID YOU BORROW FROM AMERICA'S MORTAL ENEMY RUSSIA AND PUTIN? ??,,,sad,,disaster, ,,DON'T CONGRATULATE! !!!!!!!!!!
8372 2018-03-24 13:48:01 Obama did not legalize bump stocks, they were already legal. Stop blaming stupid crap on a better President
8373 2018-03-24 13:47:53 Ban on Bump Stocks is actually a sales promotion for high priced machine guns by #NRA
8374 2018-03-24 13:47:48 Remember when he blamed someone for stocks falling & said people should sue that person? Cannot recall exactly who & what stock but he did say that.
8375 2018-03-24 13:47:05 Scam accounts are ran on bot networks similar to that of email fraud. What I mean by infrastructure is the manipulation of the market place, same situation happened in the stock market in penny stocks, if you don't recall. It's still in issue that's being fought to this day.
8376 2018-03-24 13:46:44 @HaloTopCreamery Where stocks the dairy free range?
8377 2018-03-24 13:45:48 I feel the same way about bump stocks, however we shouldn't give an inch more on 2A.  It's the principle and the process Im concerned with.
8378 2018-03-24 13:44:53 So get rid of bump stocks. But understand that it is the person that fired the gun. The gun does not fire itself.
8379 2018-03-24 13:44:44 He lost me on bump stocks.
8380 2018-03-24 13:44:27 Obama legalized bump stocks in 2010. 
8381 2018-03-24 13:43:52 Thank god for my OTC stocks that kept my portfolio positive yesterday while almost all my other securities were down.
8382 2018-03-24 13:42:50 Obama legalized bump stocks
8383 2018-03-24 13:42:24 @realDonaldTrump bans bump stocks...where’s the applause?
8384 2018-03-24 13:42:15 It's called sarcasm banning bump stocks won't make a difference if you have a fast trigger finger you don't need one
8385 2018-03-24 13:41:59 MIFID II only in force in 2018.
Move in right direction as It compels asset managers to reveal underlying costs to clients, though it does not cover pension products. 
My comments on transparency relate to investment fees per se not FTSE
8386 2018-03-24 13:41:47 I spent half of my day learning about stocks and saving money. Huhu imy boys @official_UN_B
8387 2018-03-24 13:41:43 @TheDemocrats Obama for legalizing bump stocks
8388 2018-03-24 13:40:36 Mr. Trump, stop spreading Fake News. Obama adminstratio  never legalized bump stocks.
8389 2018-03-24 13:40:33 Never required to register bump stocks so WHO knows WHO has what.? Trump knows this is "feelgood" & no rights lost.
8390 2018-03-24 13:40:33 You don’t need a bump stock to do what it does. This is so stupid and a waste of time. Also you can’t just change definitions because words mean things. Bump stocks don’t turn a gun into a machine gun.
8391 2018-03-24 13:40:29 ban bump stocks too
8392 2018-03-24 13:40:24 3/"Arms"

Bump stocks, high capacity mags r not in the 2A. What's ur excuse for those?

Up until the 70s, the @NRA was more of a sporting club. In the 80s, early 90s, some among them wanted regular citizens to b able to own auto weapons. That was BANNED. Guess why?

8443 2018-03-24 13:39:44 Most stocks in microcap, small cap and midcap will show high beta now. Conditions are such. Some which are being managed by large investors will also crack over time spiking the beta sharply.
8444 2018-03-24 13:39:17 But it’s a start. There shouldn’t be reasons for high capacity magazines/ bump stocks and any loop holes that go to creating them. I think there should be a registry. I think we need to completely repeal the Dickey Amendment so that we can study this.

8447 2018-03-24 13:37:47 Obama didn’t legalize bump stocks. Why is everything out of your mouth a lie?

In a downtrend - people delay to buy stocks in anticipation of lower stock price tomorrow

8450 2018-03-24 13:35:57 Never forget that volatility is part of earning the higher returns from stocks.  Even with the volatility in 2018, last 12 months are well above average:

DFA US Core 2 Equity = +12.3%
DFA Int’l Core Equity = +16.1%
DFA EM Core Equity = +19.1%
DFA Investment Grade Bond = +0.3%
8451 2018-03-24 13:35:26 That's inaccurate. The Obama administration did not have the power to legalize or outlaw bump stocks, that's in Congress's purview. The ATF concluded that the bump stocks did not violate current law, which has been largely controlled by NRA and Republican policies.
8452 2018-03-24 13:35:18 That’s all thanks to the NRA writing our existing gun laws. If it doesn’t alter the rate of fire the product can be sold. Bump stocks don’t make the gun different they allow the trigger to be pulled faster.

8454 2018-03-24 13:34:58 Been careful this time not to show up on the SHP listing in  stocks I recently bought.  Knew stocks will correct sharply.  Many did; I remain a buyer. Scaling up now to right size positions. 

Microcaps seem headed for a sharp dip in Q1 FY19.

8457 2018-03-24 13:34:27 This doesn't change the fact that each round fired requires an individual pull of the trigger. You can be for banning bump fire stocks if you want. It doesn't bother me either way. Just don't try to tell me they do something they don't.

8459 2018-03-24 13:34:06 #DesperateDeanHeller is lying  to #Nevadans.

The truth is;

Obama NEVER legalized bump stocks. 

Obama EOs created stricter controls (all of which Trump has rolled back). 

A Heller led Congress refused to preemptively act on bump stocks.

8461 2018-03-24 13:33:43 The Obama administration determined the ATF did not have the right to regulate bump stocks. Pres. Obama tried to regulate guns during his entire presidency, and was blocked by the GOP and NRA.
8462 2018-03-24 13:33:36 This is a lie. Obama admin did not legalize bump stocks. GOP congress refused to take up gun safety.
8463 2018-03-24 13:33:25 Well, the ATF ruled they were an accessory. It’s not like congress or the president sat down and said these illegal bump stocks should be legal. The co. Invented it and submitted for approval. ATF morons said it’s an accessory that doesn’t alter gun mechanics. They’re right....
8464 2018-03-24 13:32:39 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
8465 2018-03-24 13:32:36 Banning bump stocks is a meaningless distraction from real issues. Before the Vegas Massacre, only one in a million people knew what a bump stock was. Banning bump stocks is just another incremental erosion of the 2nd Amendment. Little by little our freedoms are taken away.
8466 2018-03-24 13:32:19 Svět zase nefunguje tak, jak by někteří chtěli.
"Zlý" Trump zakáže prodej tzv. bumper stocks, tedy nástavců, které umožňují střílet z poloautomatické pušky jako z automatické. Kdo jejich prodej povolil? No přeci "hodný" Obama. Jejda! :(
8467 2018-03-24 13:32:04 Ummm.... that's not what she's saying. She's saying that at a minimum, we need to get rid of bump stocks. 

Also, I'm pretty sure she's not who you think she is.

8469 2018-03-24 13:31:05 Bump stocks are a red herring, in the vast majority of situations they make the weapon LESS effective ...
8470 2018-03-24 13:30:30 Machine guns are legal in many states with the proper paperwork.
Are you saying that law abiding citizens have to turn in their bump stocks? Never thought you would ban anything gun related. You give gun grabbers an inch they will take a mile. Still on the

8473 2018-03-24 13:29:55 The Obama administration did NOT legalize bump stocks. Why do you lie about such easily verified things?
8474 2018-03-24 13:29:51 If gun-grabbers had the brains God gave a goat, they'd promote bump stocks because they reduce accuracy, as in reduce effectiveness.
8475 2018-03-24 13:29:28 and bump stocks
8476 2018-03-24 13:29:21 @BarackObama was more pro-gun that @realDonaldTrump. The one thing that got Trump elected was all the gun owners in America. He just lost half his voting block. If he bans bump stocks because of a bunch of crying high schoolers, he will not be re-elected.
8477 2018-03-24 13:29:05 Hey Dotard.  Do your homework. 

The Obama administration didn't legalize bump stocks. 

Obama issued EOs creating stricter controls (all of which Trump has rolled back), but could not legally restrict (non mechanical) bump stocks without new laws. Congress refused.
8478 2018-03-24 13:28:50 Donald was at least one mass shooting too late in banning bump stocks.  @POTUS is a pathological liar.  @realDonaldTrump #VegasShooting
8479 2018-03-24 13:28:45 You should in a sense. Quite a few non-rich people’s income depend for at least some part on the stocks of the biggest companies (and therefore the richest people). 401k plans (pension plans, big in USA) depend on some stocks/investment opportunities.

8485 2018-03-24 13:28:10 Once again, a lie. A "quirk" in the law DID NOT ALLOW bump stocks to fall under machine gun status thus their abolishment was not permitted
8486 2018-03-24 13:27:45 Vegas was the event (however it went down) that brought bump stocks into the public eye, only reason it's referenced.

8490 2018-03-24 13:26:31 Just like Obama legalized shot guns? tRump can't open his mouth without lying.

Nobody outside the coven of NRA gun humpers ever heard of bump stocks until recently.
8491 2018-03-24 13:26:25 What is incredible is that it took this amount of attention and activism for Congress do as little as it did and to provoke Trump to ban bump stocks even if the ATF does not have the authority to do that.

8494 2018-03-24 13:25:31 @smerconish Almost impossible to stop the lone wolf like the Vegas shooter. We must try to stop the mass casualties. We don’t need to ban guns let’s restrict the performance of the guns. No high capacity magazines no high velocity ammunition no bump stocks etc.
8495 2018-03-24 13:25:00 I'm somewhat of a "purist" I guess you can say, so personally, I don't really care about bump-stocks at all, (I know that's not the point however).  

I think President Trump "may" be getting some wrong advice this time around!
8496 2018-03-24 13:24:22 Order your Bump stocks now before it's too late. Keep them in your cabinet next to year illegal automatic weapons that you're stockpiling

8505 2018-03-24 13:19:22 First, that's a blatant LIE. Congress wouldn't allow it. They would have had to write new legislation to ban bump stocks because they were considered an accessory & were not subject to regulation.
8506 2018-03-24 13:19:05 You should try shooting a gun with one of the bump stocks installed. They suck. I can fire faster with my finger. Soon my finger will be banned also.
8507 2018-03-24 13:19:00 I don’t support the ban. It’s an abjectly stupid, do-nothing, emotional reaction. People were bump firing guns for a long time before bump stocks made it possible even for uncoordinated doofs who don’t want to practice a little

8510 2018-03-24 13:18:15 Not just bump stocks, but ALL rate increasing devices...Match Triggers, binary triggers, etc. They all fall under the bump stock rules
8511 2018-03-24 13:18:11 Natural Born LIAR. BUMP STOCKS ONLY LEGALIZED FOR DISABLED PEOPLE WHO COULD NOT PULL TRIGGER. PERIOD ALL OTHER SALES ARE ILLEGAL.

8513 2018-03-24 13:17:40 That happened to me. Rang to arrange a viewing and was told there were 8 offers on the table! No way to verify & funnily enough we got the property.

8519 2018-03-24 13:14:56 Your pants are on fire again. The TRUTH is, that bump stocks were legally a "gun part" not a firearm and couldn't be regulated under the current laws. OBAMA DID NOT LEGALIZE BUMP STOCKS. p.s. your capitalization doesn't = truth.

8526 2018-03-24 13:12:11 Why is this so hard? "We're writing a proposal to propose proposing a ban on bump stocks to be considered a later date yet to be determined." Just ban the fucking things already. If I didn't know better, I'd think they're dragging their feet.
8527 2018-03-24 13:12:09 Funny, you mean the Republican led ATF overturned a 2005 ruling to see bump stocks as non-firearm purchase.
8528 2018-03-24 13:12:03 U r a liar and ur followers should know that.

The Obama administration didn’t legalize bump stocks.

8535 2018-03-24 13:07:49 No. (1) this source NTK is a GOP connected opinion website w strong right wing bias. (2) Obama tried to ban bump stocks but found that by official definition they did not qualify under firearms regulations. That does not equal "approval".

8541 2018-03-24 13:06:47 It's not a lie. The ATF explicitly approved the sale of bump stocks TWICE during the Obama admin. They couldn't ruled differently and let the courts decide.

8552 2018-03-24 13:02:28 Trump continuing to dismantle Obama's failed policies.  Bump stocks were approved for sale by Obama's ATF.
8553 2018-03-24 13:01:45 Actually bump stocks had no mechanical part that altered a gun and thus was not illegal under the law at the time. Who rolled back Obama's EO that said mentally ill people could not have a gun? THAT guy's a real asshole! You should find out who that was and fire him.
8554 2018-03-24 13:01:43 candidate we have ever seen.

8555 2018-03-24 13:01:00 SLEAZY Donald just spews out information without fact checking it. He said Obama's administration legalized bump stocks. SLEAZY was so busy rolling back Obama's works in an effort to erase his legacy (unsuccessful!). Did SLEAZY roll back Obama's law prohibiting bump stocks?
8556 2018-03-24 13:00:57 Weird how when he was president we didn’t have any problems with bump stocks.. now that you’re here we must ban everything.
8557 2018-03-24 13:00:45 Proud of @realDonaldTrump also
However 
There are a couple of issues I wish that he remained strong on

1. #2a He should not support any changes to it, not even bump stocks, give #dems a inch...they will take a mile
2. #Omnibus bill, Jesus, were do I begin?
8558 2018-03-24 13:00:37 Aber was sind das für Waffen? Haben die Finnen auch Schnellfeuergewehre mit Bump Stocks und Riesenmagazinen? Oder wohl doch eher Schrotflinten für die Jagd und zuhause vllt. ne 9mm?
8559 2018-03-24 13:00:22 I am hoping this#SaturdayMorning that the kids have a successful and safe day today. Bump stocks are not enough to get rid of them..goooooooo kids!
8560 2018-03-24 13:00:18 Paid Piper !
8561 2018-03-24 12:59:59 No Obama didn’t legalize bump stocks. You literally can not tell the truth. Ever.
8562 2018-03-24 12:59:49 Fact: DOJ under Obama determined federal gun laws prevented them from banning bump stocks w/o further action from Congress.
8563 2018-03-24 12:59:36 Obama Administration legalization of bump stocks is A BAD IDEA!

Former president Obama must be crying out loud to Michelle right now.

Obama : What am I gonna do!

Michelle Obama : Shut up, I'm eating!
8564 2018-03-24 12:59:35 There was no effort from the right to restrict bump stocks after LV. It wasn't until the Parkland kids got hype. It's why I'll give them a few hours of my time this morning. Even if I think many anti-gun platforms are a bit excessive, the other side is just thick and reactionary
8565 2018-03-24 12:59:01 For sure it’s coming. Like his banning bump stocks charade tweet yesterday. #fraud
8566 2018-03-24 12:58:59 Fact: Bump stocks approved but not legalized during Obama administration. Bump socks are legal in New York State, illegal in Massachusetts. I think the actual legalization is state by state.
8567 2018-03-24 12:58:52 Cryptocurrencies don't have the framework in place just yet, which makes it difficult for investors to take money out of stocks and put them into the digital currencies. Once it does, there will be no reason left. 
#blockchain #fintech #cryptocurrency
8568 2018-03-24 12:58:14 With regards to stocks. A massive % of the market caps are leverage. Thats why when it dumps, and I mean really dumps. It will be huge
8569 2018-03-24 12:57:41 LIAR
Obama issued EOs creating stricter controls (all of which Trump has rolled back), but could not legally restrict (non mechanical) bump stocks without new laws. Congress refused.
8570 2018-03-24 12:56:56 Stock Traders what's something you consistently struggle with during the trading day? #stocks
8571 2018-03-24 12:56:54 There is an insurance product for retirement funds: options, especially puts. Puts can be used to insure stocks. I've even employed beta-weighted puts on indexes to offset losses in mutual funds until markets could recover. $SPY
8572 2018-03-24 12:56:38 What does this have to do w/bump stocks? I know you hate Trump, but stay on subject. Is his proposal to ban bump stocks bad? U won't answer.
8573 2018-03-24 12:56:34 Who is telling you that you don't. We all have the divine right to live without fear. If you use your gun to hunt, and not to kill people that's fine. The only law that we want is to change the age from 18 to 21. To not sell semi automatic and bump stocks.
8574 2018-03-24 12:56:15 I’m old enough to remember when a Democrat President didn’t ban bump stocks because he recognized he lacked the Constitutional authority to do so. Bizarro world again.
8575 2018-03-24 12:55:01 So what about the thousands of bump stocks already in the collections of responsible gun owners ?
8576 2018-03-24 12:54:42 This man is quickly killing off USA stocks that Americans took pride in. Never in the history of any presidency did DOW JONES lost over 1000 point because of a speech/decision made by our president .
8577 2018-03-24 12:54:38 Bump stocks are an aftermarket accessory. Any rifle round will go through Kevlar; AR-15's don't fire special bullets. Any firearm that accepts a detachable magazine has an arbitrary capacity, not that there's any number of bullets that makes a firearm useless only to murderers
8578 2018-03-24 12:53:55 Thanks to both you and Mandy for the donations Mark, means a lot!
8579 2018-03-24 12:53:53 Trump is a crazy and a bit of a narcissist but yalls blind worship of obama is silly. He was just a guy. He could of changed the definition of automatic weapon and made bump stocks illegal but he did not. I loathe hypocrisy on both sides.
8580 2018-03-24 12:53:46 This man is quickly killing off USA stocks that Americans took pride in. Never in the history of any presidency did DOW JONES lost over 1000 point because of a speech/decision made by our president .
8581 2018-03-24 12:53:32 So the danish have said they are going deplete our fish stocks before Brexit. Sorry, I will not deplete their bacon stocks from now on. :))
8582 2018-03-24 12:53:23 This man is quickly killing off USA stocks that Americans took pride in. Never in the history of any presidency did DOW JONES lost over 1000 point because of a speech/decision made by our president .
8583 2018-03-24 12:52:55 I find it funny you think a Democratic President said oh let’s make sure we legalize bump stocks! Wow!!
8584 2018-03-24 12:52:13 Why? That bill has everything @AnnCoulter loves! Money for @PPFA and @PBS, also money for universal background checks and banning bump stocks. 

I mean, it's a coup for a democratic president such as this one...wait. He's NOT a democrat?
8585 2018-03-24 12:51:52 Trump tweet yesterday

Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.

8587 2018-03-24 12:51:02  le gestion des rééditions et stocks de Scythe semble pédaler dans la semoule.
8588 2018-03-24 12:50:56 In his continuing ineptness, Liar trump has done that-twisted his words via Twitter about Obama & gun laws saying Obama APPROVED bump stocks. #45 once again has further divided the American people over this issue. Firstly, Obama attempted to ban assault guns in 2012 ....
8589 2018-03-24 12:50:54 EU docs shows that they have made billions from our fish, it’s almost like a wanton destruction of fish stocks.
8590 2018-03-24 12:50:14 And stocks will continue to drop whit the decisions Trump is making.
8591 2018-03-24 12:48:15 stopped being about protecting 2A years ago - now it’s about money from the gunmakers - ironic that since dons election guns sales are dropping gun makers stocks are doing badly the gun industry was the first but not last industry to be hurt by don
8592 2018-03-24 12:47:53 So we can set our own quotas (we already have a big part setting CFP quotas) but it is limited by our a much smaller grounds. We hugely overfished before, limiting us to our waters will likely mean even more stringent quotas to ensure fish stocks remain sustainable
8593 2018-03-24 12:47:17 Obama NEVER legalized bump stocks. Do your research
8594 2018-03-24 12:46:55 Which stocks ... Or entire market sir
8595 2018-03-24 12:46:33 Looking forward to it.  Hopefully theses marches spur meaningful change...ban bump stocks, ban AR-15s, comprehensive background checks, close gun show loop hole, NO conceal carry reciprocity (bill sponsor compared this to carrying a drivers license...DUMB).
8596 2018-03-24 12:46:07 Moving forward, Citi will require  all its clients to only sell firearms to purchasers who have passed a  background check, restrict sales to customers under the age of 21, as  well as stop the sale of bump stocks and “high-capacity magazines.”
8597 2018-03-24 12:46:01 Me. President; please control the downfall in stocks.
8598 2018-03-24 12:45:51 Stocks to Watch: MDB, CVX, CVX. Read our in-depth analysis for more.
8599 2018-03-24 12:45:31 Or perhaps do something crazy and having some reasonable gun restrictions? You aren't allowed to own surface-to-air missiles or bombs. Add assault rifles, bump stocks, and large capacity magazines to the list.
8600 2018-03-24 12:45:04 Yeah init roll on being at work all weekend 
8601 2018-03-24 12:44:56 It's is filled with years of cases of men
( I don't know why it's always men) using high capacity gun  magazines bump stocks and Ar15's.
Yes, you can kill someone with a sword etc. just not nearly as fast.
That's not an emotional reaction, that's fact based data.
8602 2018-03-24 12:44:22 GPU prices have been weird for ages and stocks being bought en masse by coin miners.
8603 2018-03-24 12:44:20 No - International law, in this case UNCLOS, doesn’t give an absolute right to fish stocks. It stipulates that highly migratory species, straddling stocks & surplus all have to be taken into account alongside the historic rights of coastal states prior to creation of EEZ in 1976!
8604 2018-03-24 12:44:09 FRANCIS-The profanity on your profile shows you're too ignorant to know it hurts kids or you just don't care. Is banning bump stocks bad?
8605 2018-03-24 12:43:39 Also, a ban on semi-automatic rifles, bump stocks, and high capacity weapons don't affect the statistics and reality: in 2016, handguns, were used to kill more than anything else, 7,105 people were murdered with handguns. Followed by knives, with 1,604. Rifles, 374.
8606 2018-03-24 12:43:34 Can you ban finger speed also. I agree with the bump stock but the real solution is far more than single issue bump stocks. Age limits, registration,Security like trigger locks, Personal owner responsibility laws requiring them to be the sole guardian of any gun they own.
8607 2018-03-24 12:43:30 Trump trying to blame Obama for bump stocks is the height irresponsible, narcissistic stupidity. Congress & the NRA, gun lobby blocked all PBO's attempts to change gun laws. Trump's lies are boundless. #NewDay
8608 2018-03-24 12:43:10 Our closing offers are still going strong with a minimum of 20% off everything in the store. Visit us today and pick up a bargain whilst stocks last!! #Canterbury #Herne #whistable #maplin
8609 2018-03-24 12:43:08 #Trump decides to leave town and heads to Palm Springs to deal with bump stocks rather than address “March for Our Lives.” What a coward! #MarchForOurLives
8610 2018-03-24 12:42:51 "Not because they liked it, but because the law did not permit them to prohibit it," Winkler told the fact-checking organization, which explored the issue after the National Rifle Association said in October that the Obama administration approved bump stocks on two occasions.
8611 2018-03-24 12:42:48 Nobody will be destroying their bump stocks....- my thoughts.
8612 2018-03-24 12:42:32 This surely is a factor, but I think the root problem is that cod stocks are so decimated by decades of unsustainable fishing that they they are no longer resilient to any stressor. Time was, there were millions of seals AND millions of cod.
8613 2018-03-24 12:42:11 dream big start small. ubusan stocks dun eh. gusto ko yung sayo kaso large size sya. and yung ibang magandang design kung hindi large, extra large naman.
8614 2018-03-24 12:41:39 Banning bump stocks is a measure the NRA supports. If your not going to support Trump, who do support. I know in your state as well as mine, there are much bigger issues than Trump.
8615 2018-03-24 12:40:58 Wrong. ATF found on two occasions that there was no law which prevented them from allowing the manufacture & sale of bump stocks, which is quite a bit different from "legalizing" same.

Department of Justice cannot unilaterally change the law.
8616 2018-03-24 12:40:52 Wrong again!  Adam Winkler, a constitutional law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, told PolitiFact that it is accurate to say the Obama administration approved the sale of bumps stocks.
8617 2018-03-24 12:40:05 Products are invented and put on the market. When they are considered dangerous, they are made illegal. NRA is responsible for putting these on the market. If Obama wanted to illegalize bump stocks reps would have blocked it like everything else he tried to pass.
8618 2018-03-24 12:39:57 J'ai le feu vert de Miss W pour aller à Action cet aprem. Je vais voir l'état des stocks ;)
8619 2018-03-24 12:39:40 While it is good to add “bump stocks” etc. to the list of illegal aftermarket attachments, when will you follow up on REAL conversations about common sense gun laws, limits & enforcement? The time is now. #NeverAgain
8620 2018-03-24 12:38:46 The ATF under Obama determined that certain BUMP STOCKS didn't meet the criteria to be a firearm & we're therefore not subject to regulation by ATF. Other BUMP STOCKS did meet the criteria & we're banned. Get your facts straight. Obama didn't 'legalize' BUMP STOCKS!
8621 2018-03-24 12:38:41 You're lying. Again. Bump stocks were never legalized under Pres Obama. Stop misdirecting.
8622 2018-03-24 12:38:01 The sale of bump stocks is about to go through the roof during your "mandated" comment period.  Why has it take so many months to address this?  How many have been sold since Las Vegas?
8623 2018-03-24 12:36:56 Cowardly Donald.  Our nation is ruled by laws. President Obama could not ban “bump stocks”by administrative fiat.  And, the Republican Congress would not change the law. You have the same issue, you just aren’t smart enough to know it.
8624 2018-03-24 12:36:52 THERE ARE MILLIONS OF UNANSWERED QUESTIONS PERTAINING TO OBAMA’S QUEER HANDLING OF SEVERAL GUN ISSUES SUCH AS:

1.  WHY WOULD HE JEOPARDIZE HIS ENTIRE PRESIDENCY TO RUN 20,000 POLICE FIREARMS TO MEXICAN DRUG DEALER

2.  WHY DID HE GIVE THE OKAY FOR THE PUBLIC SALE OF BUMP STOCKS
8625 2018-03-24 12:36:38 Trump's bullshit about bump stocks, after he repealed Obama's Mentally Ill gun laws.. can fuck right off.  Until you at least put that law back in -mentally ill CAN NOT get a gun, just stay at your country club and hide.
8626 2018-03-24 12:36:38 Now the President is making the Gun Problem "BUMP STOCKS": That's great BUT the Problem is the AR-15 Rifle that is what was used to kill and slaughter all these Young adults killing Bump stocks is Great but the PROBLEM is the AR-15 Rifle it is WHAT NEEDS TO BE BANNED!
8627 2018-03-24 12:35:29 Why is the NRA fighting this ban on bump stocks?!? No one is taking away their precious guns, just trying to make them a little less deadly. That's a problem why??? Srsly, wtf is wrong w those people?!? #FtheNRA
8628 2018-03-24 12:35:16 RT amtickerde "(Trump, DOJ Propose Plan To Ban All Bump Stocks)"
8629 2018-03-24 12:34:17 Bump stocks are a novelty. Not really useful.
8630 2018-03-24 12:34:15 I'm planning to buy a new book where I can read painful things, etc. But then PSICOM announced suddenly that they are going to Cavite. 

Me: Next time na nga lang. Marami pa naman sigurong stocks no'n.
8631 2018-03-24 12:34:14 Is there a way congress can put a stop to what he’s doing with bump stocks? I have read the DOJ release & down in the details is infringements, lies, &/or misunderstandings. They addressed our grievances & flat out disagreed then used lawyer talk for were gonna do what we want.
8632 2018-03-24 12:32:41 This isn't true, according to many legal experts. The law during the Obama administration didn't allow the prohibition of bump stocks. There's a big difference between this and approving them.
8633 2018-03-24 12:32:10 But stocks no prob right?! hehehehe :)
8634 2018-03-24 12:32:01 And a ton of sub 21 year olds do business with Citi bank who’s stocks dropped 4.6% after their righteous announcement.
8635 2018-03-24 12:31:55 So trumpet the commie blames Obama for approving "bump stocks" when he did no such thing. However this russian president has rolled BACK every Obama regulation relating to controlling gun laws.
8636 2018-03-24 12:30:52 You’re worried about bump stocks but fund Planned Parenthood...SMH
8637 2018-03-24 12:30:45 Wait. So Obama, the man the rightwing swore was trying to take their guns and abolish the 2nd amendment, LEGALIZED bump stocks? Wtf? Not even your sycophants believe this. Damn, you really got it bad for Obama. Just ask him to call you or something, this is pathetic
8638 2018-03-24 12:30:36 But you see, positive change has already happened....
When the omnibus spending bill was signed into law, bump stocks became illegal...
8639 2018-03-24 12:30:08 Which clicks stocks your products in pretoria?
8640 2018-03-24 12:29:45 According to an article, mutual funds invest their money in already invest stocks to boost their fund's NAV before closing of the year i.e. March.
8641 2018-03-24 12:29:36 I'm ok with banning bumps stocks. @StephenGutowski

8643 2018-03-24 12:28:13 If you believe any nonsense out of the mouth of Farage then I'm afraid you have destroyed any argument that you argue from a sensible position. It is EU policy that is protecting stocks without which you have no job!
8644 2018-03-24 12:28:10 How come nothing from Trump when stocks are falling? When they were up he talked incessantly about how he single-handedly turned the economy around.
8645 2018-03-24 12:28:05 Like you r growing but not your brain ;)
8646 2018-03-24 12:26:49 Obama Administration legalized bump stocks.
8647 2018-03-24 12:26:43 Heck if I know sir... I'm not psychic... The market defies the way things should be all the time, especially with junior stocks, so it doesn't really matter anyways... Still though, regardless, I like to know what's happening in real life, outside of all that defiance...
8648 2018-03-24 12:25:52 How can the % of stocks be 15 and the total number zero. makes --well--zero sense! Or do i need new math skills?
8649 2018-03-24 12:25:30 @FootballWest SUBSTITUTION | '64 | @JoondalupUnited Parvis Shizardi on for Callum Stocks. #NPLWA

8651 2018-03-24 12:24:55 What does the Justice Department have to with the ban on bump stocks?  Con Artist Trump actually thought that yarn would work to divert ( once again) attention from the real agenda of assault weapons. He really did. You can believe it.
8652 2018-03-24 12:24:06 The first sub for JUFC sees Callum Stocks replaced by Parviz Shizardi. #NPLWA
8653 2018-03-24 12:24:00 Can you ever just share something you are doing without insulting or finger-pointing at someone else?! I wanted to “like” this post - banning bump stocks is important. But I cannot  give you kudos when you are so nasty in your delivery. Grow up @POTUS.
8654 2018-03-24 12:23:14 Definitely an oversimplification on your part...but investors only care about where a stock is going not where it's been & $DB is better play than $BAC b/c ALL US Banks are over bought so it's  time to take profits and rotate to a mix of growth and defensive stocks given climate
8655 2018-03-24 12:22:53 YouTube said this week that it would start removing videos next month that promote the sale or manufacture of firearms and accessories, especially those that allow simulated automatic firing, like bump stocks.

@nytimes
8656 2018-03-24 12:22:25 Watching the beginnings of the 'march of our lives' in Washington DC. Quite something. Trump has already reacted, ordering the justice dept to draft plan to deal with bump stocks. Momentum happening. But can it sustain? #MarchForOurLives

8658 2018-03-24 12:22:12 You are so full of shit. Obama didn’t legalize bump stocks. The law didn’t allow him to prohibit them, big difference. And if congress wanted to regulate them they could AND should have.
8659 2018-03-24 12:21:32 MARCH of OUR LIVES 2018.
* TRUMP.. announced yesterday that the Justice Department will now " process the ban on bump stocks." Again .. a colossal Con Game.  Who does he think he's kidding?  Only Congress can regulate any gun restrictions or ammunition.
8660 2018-03-24 12:20:55 1st they came for our bump stocks, then they came for our guns 
8661 2018-03-24 12:20:46 samething is happening in india too ...most are talking about up mkt and some hiding in debt mkt .. both can go down that they dont know .rates spike with currency falling and stocks falling can be a trend .mutual funds dont invest in gold etc. no place t hide
8662 2018-03-24 12:20:25 You ban gun stocks to thumb you nose at Obama. You could really show him up you if outlawed assault weapons but you’re afraid of the NRA and by leaving Washington you show you are also afraid of students. A president of the people would be marching with these kids. Enjoy golf.
8663 2018-03-24 12:19:45 Anybody investing in stocks/bonds at the moment?
8664 2018-03-24 12:19:44 Over bump stocks?
8665 2018-03-24 12:19:37 #LiarInChief #you loosened gun restrictions Pres Obama put in place.  44 never legalized bump stocks #alwayslying #didntyourmommateachyoubetter
8666 2018-03-24 12:19:28 2/ The basic law in Piketty’s book is wealth concentrates when this happens: rate of return on capital (think stocks and bonds) is greater than overall economic growth (think GDP). 

That’s it. If rates of capital return outpaces the economy, wealth all goes to one corner.
8667 2018-03-24 12:18:56 Obama Admin did NOT legalize bump stocks. It was a determination that current laws didn’t allow for its regulation. Also, Obama issued many executive orders promoting stricter gun control, that you have rolled back. Quit blaming Obama! #ToddlerInChief #LiarInChief
8668 2018-03-24 12:18:15 Bump stocks were approved in 2010 by the ATF - under Obama.
8669 2018-03-24 12:17:46 Because bump stocks don't have any moving parts, they are a "firearm part" and can not be regulated as a firearm under existing gun laws.  The law did not permit them to prohibit it, Stop being a big fat lair tRump.
8670 2018-03-24 12:17:39 How about resigning so that our 401K stocks get a bump??
8671 2018-03-24 12:16:49 Bump stocks are the spinner hubcaps of the firearm world.
8672 2018-03-24 12:16:33 Thank you for strengthing the background check system.  Bomb stocks do not make semiautos fully auto.  How about conceal carry reciprocity?  How about prosecuting Broward County sheriff for not committing Cruz? How about laws to keep guns away from violent offenders?
8673 2018-03-24 12:15:06 NEWS: Was Präs. #Obama nicht durchsetzen konnte, Präs. #Trump greift durch: 
Bump Stocks (Schnellfeuer-Vorrichtung für halbautomatische Waffen) werden verboten #USA
8674 2018-03-24 12:14:52 Cool let's ban bump stocks... Then let's ban belts because not only do they keep your pants up they can be used to "simulate" automatic fire just the same.... Idiots
8675 2018-03-24 12:14:44 2..See bump stocks law...which basically will outlaw your semi autos opperation rod. And now the budget.
8676 2018-03-24 12:14:35 So, let me get this straight, the @NRA, after the Vegas shooting, was for the ban on bump stocks, and now that Trump wants to actually implement it, they're against it? Par for the course really. It's to be expected from a Domestic Terrorist Organisation like them.
8677 2018-03-24 12:14:31 @mitchellvii What are Trump's motives for proposing a bump stock ban? Bump stocks were ruled to not be illegal. They're also very easy to make. It doesn't make a lot of sense to propose such a thing. Who is he playing?
8678 2018-03-24 12:14:04 Bump stocks?
They were not used in parkland.
You are the most ineffective president in history.keep pissing off these 16-17 yr old kids and learn in 2020.

8680 2018-03-24 12:13:29 No one is thinking of “Bump Stocks” this morning. The smile on Nancy Pelosi’s face after you signed away your wall and the mid-term elections is what everyone is talking about. Everyone knows the fight against the 2nd amendment has always been about the mid-terms?
8681 2018-03-24 12:13:22 Bout to fuck with these stocks and really be on

Why:
 Mistake 1:You invested on some poor quality business or
Mistake 2:You paid rich valuations for good quality stocks.
If you committed both mistakes you are in danger zone.
Learn=buy quality @ right price.
8683 2018-03-24 12:12:54 This will be good if you do make them illegal, but NOBODY made them legal. They were created legally and in 2010 the ATF determined “bump stocks” are firearm “parts” and are not regulated under gun laws.  Why make shit up and point fingers, JUST FIX IT.
8684 2018-03-24 12:12:09 The UK can control its Fishing but only in concert with others,  since fish don't give a Flying Fish about borders and international quotas are the only practical way of maintaining stocks. History has proved having no regard for stock control leads to depletion.
8685 2018-03-24 12:11:35 Agree. Let's follow 2A to the letter. First 3 words are literally "A well regulated" Universal background checks, bring back assault weapon ban, no bump stocks, no high cap magazines, insurance policy required for ownership of > 1 gun. That would be a good start.

8687 2018-03-24 12:11:12 If ur tweet had started here it would have been CONSTRUCTIVE vs DIVISIVE! “As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns. “
8688 2018-03-24 12:11:04 You have stabbed us gun owners in the back. I am sure you will see it in November. You should have VETO the Bill Trump!!! Bump Stocks do not make a gun full auto!! You wasted my vote!!!!
8689 2018-03-24 12:09:28 Bump stocks – big deal. This won't stop one shooting, and you know it. Do something real, motherfucker.
8690 2018-03-24 12:09:07 Universal background checks. 3 day waiting period. Close gun show loopholes. No peer to peer gun sales without a background check. Ban assault rifles, bump stocks and high capacity magazines. Accept nothing less. #MarchForOurLives
8691 2018-03-24 12:08:59 @realDonaldTrump 
You can attempt to ban transgenders from the military.
You can pander and gratuitously attempt to ban bump stocks.
You can sign bills.
You can hide out on tax payer funds.
Deny,distract, deflect all you want.
It won’t change the #MarchForOurLives .
8692 2018-03-24 12:08:43 Dear students,
We legalized bump stocks, presided over fast & furious and were lax on enforcing existing laws. Hope you're feeling better.

8695 2018-03-24 12:08:23 Not True,legislation by Feinstein was introduced after Sandy Hook to ban bump stocks & gained no traction with a GOP controlled House  

Furthermore DOJ/ATF can’t enforce regulations on the ban of Bump Stocks w/o congressional legislation. So maybe get ur GOP to pass something
8696 2018-03-24 12:08:07 That’s the plan! Let the day job pay the bills and let the stocks pay for thrills! When the debts are all gone, go buy houses for your favorite family members and then help the less fortunate!

8703 2018-03-24 12:04:48 Bad, very bad decision. I voted for you, now you're a knee jerk nitwit like the entire leftist movement. Banning bump stocks will do nothing to curb ANY crime, and the left will want more, and more, and more.

Way to go. You just kissed the 2020 election goodbye.
8704 2018-03-24 12:04:30 Bad idea=banning bump stocks. You're inviting Dracula into your home.
8705 2018-03-24 12:02:34 STOP twisting the facts!! Did your buddy Wayne LaPierre feed you this tweet! They did NOT legalize bump stocks! ATF determined law did not allow them to regulate them! It was not a Presidential approval but an ATF determination! On another note, #TrumpRussia
8706 2018-03-24 12:02:03 That is wholly incorrect
2010 ATF said it couldn't stop gun stocks
Obama proposed legislature to ban gun stocks
The GOP Congress refused to support it
#WrongAgainMoron
8707 2018-03-24 12:01:27 OPCW saying Russian stocks of Novichok would have degraded since made in the old Soviet Union. So someone nicked some, kept it 30 years then took it to Salisbury miraculously evading airport security ? Not very likely. Maybe it was here all the time ?
8708 2018-03-24 12:01:21 @Richzeoli As in the past. The ATF will "grandfather" all existing bump stocks. You will be probably given a year to register them or turn them in. You may not have to pay the tax stamp but will be fingerprinted and potgraphed. Instant Felony if you dont. Law abiding to criminal.

8710 2018-03-24 12:00:31 He did not legalized bump stocks. Republicans did.
8711 2018-03-24 12:00:19 @cspanwj 1st words of the 2nd Amendmnt = "A well regulated". THIS is where focus needs 2b. No military weapons, bump stocks, hi cap mags, and univ bkgrnd checks.

8715 2018-03-24 11:59:19 Jim, i feel like Trump is using the terriffs as a negotiating tool. He said yesterday that deals are taking place. it makes sense for these terriffs to be dropped once he gets what he wants and stocks go up. your thoughts?
8716 2018-03-24 11:58:37 At the beginning of my career, I was doing institutional sales and trading, but I had a retail portfolio on the side. Clients would have, say, 9 of 10 stocks doing well, all they wanted to talk about was the one dud. Knew this wasn't for me, too aggravating.
8717 2018-03-24 11:58:31 Why you post like this?  You are like a kid, it's unprofessional to post like this. You've just tanked your stocks!
8718 2018-03-24 11:58:00 I get the need to ban things like bump stocks. There is no need for those kinds of tools in the civil pop.  However, the REAL problem isn't necessarily guns. It's a having a lack of respect for each other, its the media playing up the frequency, and its technology. #NeverAgain
8719 2018-03-24 11:57:26 Your bill a single item ban " Bump Stocks " ?

Usually you Democraps hide many unrelated things in your bills.

What else is in it !

It's time that all bills are single item bills !

This has went on entirely too long !
8720 2018-03-24 11:57:21 Wow Donnie get the facts straight. ATF under his administration ruled there was no legislation that could stop the sale of bump stocks. Obama didn't make any rulings. Wow Mr. Cliffnotes... Make legislation to stop it and stop blaming everyone. Man up Donnie.

8724 2018-03-24 11:56:47 good move and the nra agree with president trump bump stocks need be banned

8726 2018-03-24 11:55:55 Ah, you listened. And changed your profile pic. Ha!                                       Btw, we miss you tweets touting how great the economy is going... where are they?! Oh, “Stocks Sink to Worst Week in Years” - @WSJ You could always attempt to blame last week on @BarackObama
8727 2018-03-24 11:55:54 Donnie, better like this: “Today we begin what no previous administrtion could: to ban the sale of bump stocks.  I will not cow to NRA pressure, and we WILL make changes to laws to help stop the carnage, as I promised in my inaugural address. Now off to Florida at your expense.”
8728 2018-03-24 11:55:44 Holy shit! I was gonna tweet exact thing to you. When HPQ bought PALM NYSE added tracking stocks so could hedge off risk. That was a huge trade.
8729 2018-03-24 11:54:50 This is a lie. 

The Obama administration didn't legalize bump stocks. 

Obama issued EOs creating stricter controls (all of which Trump has rolled back), but could not legally restrict (non mechanical) bump stocks without new laws. Congress refused.
8730 2018-03-24 11:54:29 Obama didn't legalize bump stocks you idiot! But what he did do was try to pass common sense gun laws. You know like requiring mental health background checks for all those purchasing guns? The exact EO you reversed a year ago and now you want it back. How ironic!
8731 2018-03-24 11:53:28 If the parkland shooter would've had one the situation probably would've ended a lot quicker due to running out of ammo. It's all situational honestly. Publicizing it? Why do you think bump stocks are in existence, they were created because of the alternate way of doing it...
8732 2018-03-24 11:53:19 You are such a huge pos. Obama did not legalize bump stocks.

As an aftermarket accessory they were never illegal.

Obama pushed to make them illegal and the GOP do nothing congress blocked him.

I think everyone should start telling lies about you.

The truth about you is worse.
8733 2018-03-24 11:53:12 Untrue and banning bump stocks would have done nothing to prevent Parkland. Keep going.
8734 2018-03-24 11:52:56 Not to question the general theory, but yesterday was quite the dump for most tech stocks. 2.5% down on the Nasdaq which probably did something to the intraday moves of DBX(?)
8735 2018-03-24 11:52:06 And why are you so concerned with bump stocks? Have they caused as many deaths as alcohol? Why aren’t you making alcohol illegal?
8736 2018-03-24 11:51:52 Market popular subject at block party last night. Told neighbors I thought the bull market was over and they should sell tech stocks.

8753 2018-03-24 11:44:14 Banning bump stocks is great, but it’s NOT enough!! Care more about lives, than the NRA! Be brave for once and ban AR’s. They are America’s weapons of terror and have no place in our society!

8758 2018-03-24 11:40:59 While the lefty follows and retweet’s this garbage,she misses this. Obama  legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.
8759 2018-03-24 11:40:22 Stocks are crashing; domestic terrorism is running rampant; we are on the verge of trade wars; the entire country is in-fighting. How is this not the path to third-world-ism?
8760 2018-03-24 11:38:39 @GOP 
Ban assault weapons
Universal background checks
Three day waiting periods
Ban bump stocks
Must be 21 to get any gun

Less than 22% of gun owners are not going to terrorize 78% of us anymore. Guns must be safely monitored. The kids, future voters, are on a mission.
8761 2018-03-24 11:38:32 #saturdaymorning was not aware that the DOJ could 'make bump stocks illegal' as the Komrade-in-Chief ordered by tweet. DOJ enforces laws. Congress creates them. #MarchForOurLives

8772 2018-03-24 11:36:20 The Obama administration did not legalize bump stocks, but had no legislation with which to implement a ban. As you know, Obama repeatedly called for tougher gun laws, taking a far less ambivalent stand in the matter than your NRA-pandering, ingratiating, unprincipled self.
8773 2018-03-24 11:35:54 Does donnie know what bump stocks are / mean
8774 2018-03-24 11:34:15 Yes! Obama did stealthily write an EO legalizing bump stocks! But why?  To make mass shooting more deadly!?!??
8775 2018-03-24 11:32:40 Stocks tumble on trade fears; S&P has worst week in 2 years.  Still winning?
8776 2018-03-24 11:32:31 Obama didn't "legalize" bump stocks. They're legal because they do not affect the inner mechanics of the gun, thereby making them, by definition, fully automatic. 

It's a loophole. 

If you want to discuss something, try not to rely on Fox and Friends.
8777 2018-03-24 11:32:25 Yesterday, the VT House passed gun reform, raising age to buy to 21 with exemptions,  UBC for private sales & bans on high cap mags & bump stocks.

8779 2018-03-24 11:30:44 Bump stocks ban does not address the real problem. The real problem is the abandonment of Biblical principles and the break down of strong family values. In short, liberalism is the problem.

 Improve mental health.

This doesn’t have to be rocket science. 
8784 2018-03-24 11:29:20 It's just a delaying tactic. The Executive lacks the power to ban bump stocks. Now the NRA will sue to overturn this and will win. He looks like he's doing something but not really.
8785 2018-03-24 11:28:19 Worried about whether @realDonaldTrump and @PressSec have laryngitis. They haven't spoken about the stock market in quite a while. Trump, in fact, has tweeted about it once since stocks peaked back in January. Last week alone Americans lost $1 trillion

8788 2018-03-24 11:26:28 Are bonds viewed in the present day as a risk off asset? I would argue in the present day they really aren't. If so, comparing movements from stocks into bonds in the present day compared may not be a worthwhile data point in determining equity market health.
8789 2018-03-24 11:26:18 The NRA was for banning bumps stocks before it was cool. @tgradous
8790 2018-03-24 11:25:59 Ya Ashapura also at extremely attractive levels now. Missed out on listing that as quite a few stocks looking good now
8791 2018-03-24 11:25:39 It was on earlier. Have a feeling it’s sold out. It was limited stocks. Check the @qvcuk website.

8794 2018-03-24 11:24:28 Another lie from a pathological liar. In 2010, BATF ruled that bump-stocks, since they had no moving parts, couldn't be regulated under existing firearms regulations. 1/x #Enough #NeverAgain
8795 2018-03-24 11:24:19 That's right, there can be no free for all of European Fish stocks. If the UK "Fishes as it sees fit", we will just deplete stocks, it's happened before. Post Brexit there has to be a western European quota system. Fish have no regard for hard borders.
8796 2018-03-24 11:23:56 @cspanwj Ban AR-15s, other assault weapons, bump stocks, high-capacity magazines & other paraphernalia; implement stringent universal background checks; longer waiting periods; enforce gun-free zones; severe penalties for non-compliance; register & license every gun.
8797 2018-03-24 11:23:36 LIE. LIE. LIE. Obama adm did not legalize bump stocks. You have no shame and no soul
8798 2018-03-24 11:23:00 Where does it say you can use bump stocks?
8799 2018-03-24 11:21:15 So because Tim Cook invested his money successfully we should just give this woman the difference because she didn't and therefore didn't make as much? You don't count stocks because while it adds to your net worth, it isn't guaranteed. Don't believe me? Ask Mark Zuckerburg.
8800 2018-03-24 11:20:52 This is a lie. 
Obama issued orders (you know the strategy - you do it too) creating stricter controls (all of which YOU rolled back), but could not legally restrict (non mechanical) bump stocks without new laws. 
Congress refused.
STOP IT.

8801 2018-03-24 11:19:58 I don't own guns. I don't like guns. HOWEVER, I DO support 2nd Amendment unequivocally. With that said, common sense laws are needed now. One law would be to get rid to assault rifles and bump stocks. They serve no useful purpose.
8802 2018-03-24 11:19:49 I think bump stocks are dumb and impractical, but its our right to own one still. First its bump stocks, next its semi automatics, then it's pappy's bolt action deer rifle. Its a slippery slope
8803 2018-03-24 11:19:40 Add slingshots with bump stocks and you might have something.

8807 2018-03-24 11:18:27 Isn't "Satoshi" known to hold a huge amount of BTC? A mysterious entity that can any day sell it all. Besides wall street has already a huge grasp of the crypto markets, it's traded like stocks and mined by them. Not what Satoshi intended in the first place...
8808 2018-03-24 11:18:26 I know absolutly nothing about fish or fish stocks, but could overpopulated seals be responsible for the decline in stocks? dont they eat a shitload? #nlpoli
8809 2018-03-24 11:18:11 Australians are to focused on speculating in property market that they fail to see the great wealth generator of resource stocks. As such I’m happy for the Chinese to own and run mines whilst people pray that their $1m pile of bricks will appreciate in value.
8810 2018-03-24 11:18:06 This is completely misleading....for this week, cryptos are down 11% compared to stocks being down 6%
8811 2018-03-24 11:17:53 What percentage of americans own 401k(app 50%)or have a pension.(app 25%)  All of these individuals would own stocks.
8812 2018-03-24 11:17:43 Lots of people wish to shoot me. I hope when they come they all have bump stocks. I'll stand a better chance.

8815 2018-03-24 11:16:38 The Las Vegas shooting was a cover up - Little can be believed on anything reported during, on or afterwards - so shut up already - there were multiple shooters - shut up about bump stocks  let’s talk about the daily stabbings and crime in London 
8816 2018-03-24 11:15:45 This is just the beginning for him. First the bump stocks then the gun. Watch President Trump, he’s the one that wants to take your gun away. He wants to be like Putin his hero. Where in the Russian constitution do Russian’s have the right to bare arms.
8817 2018-03-24 11:14:20 Bump stocks were not used at the last school massacre.  More control is needed.  The NRA is not a porn star.  Don't be in bed with them.

8819 2018-03-24 11:13:52 Yeah, Obama loves bump stocks. Lmao
8820 2018-03-24 11:13:34 The ATF determined bump stocks were not illegal under existing law in both 2010 and 2012.
8821 2018-03-24 11:13:25 I will say this today and everyday bump stocks, AR-15, assalt weapons are not the problem, the problems are people passing laws and not doing there jobs to enforce them, not taking the time to protect the buildings and the children with armed guards and metal detectors!!
8822 2018-03-24 11:11:30 Misleading Sir! The Law did not permit the Obama admin to prohibit the use of bump stock! More effective common sense gun regulations proposed would never have passed a GOP controlled congress. Banning bump stocks is too little too late! What happened to universal background Chks

8829 2018-03-24 11:06:40 Obama never let a law stop him. He ignored bump stocks just so they would cause these tragedies so more guns could be banned. Fast and Furious ring a bell.

8835 2018-03-24 11:04:24 I've been very nervous that my gun is going to get mad at me and just start shooting up the place. Thank goodness I don't have bump stocks running around. I'd be a wreck.
8836 2018-03-24 11:03:14 Das Problem dürfte sein, dass selbst wenn bump stocks nicht mehr erhältlich wären - die „lowers“ der M16 Variante des berühmt berüchtigten AR15 sind es weiterhin. Damit ist der Umbau zum Vollautomat weiter möglich. Wenn auch schwieriger zu bekommen.
8837 2018-03-24 11:02:56 When used properly it turns a legal weapon into an illegal weapon. An illegal weapon that is extremely efficient at mowing down large crowds. One man used this device to shoot 500 people. We don't need bump stocks and we don't need the NRA protecting them!
8838 2018-03-24 11:02:44 Big businesses are dropping out too now. Like Mozilla but also Tesla. So that blip will only get larger. We are talking less than 7 days and stocks are collapsing already. It's over. Delete now. #DeleteFacebook
8839 2018-03-24 11:01:46 So The Don takes credit when the stocks soar, but the last time they plummeted he managed to somehow blame it on Obama. Guess Friday was Obama's fault too?

8842 2018-03-24 10:59:30 @jackhough Smart comments & reminder about FB...’the media doesn’t buy stocks’
8843 2018-03-24 10:58:55 Why are you bringing up bump stocks? You should've made the change after the shooting happened in Las Vegas. Blaming President Obama? It's always everybody else's fault. Trying to deflect from Stormy an Russia...it won't work!
8844 2018-03-24 10:58:53 No we don't. They aren't "our" fish, we can't control where they move in the sea. Outside of a coordinated fishing policy we have no control over how other people affect fish stocks.

Leaving this means losing control of our markets & ability to manage fish stocks.
8845 2018-03-24 10:57:32 Are you fully invested in stocks at your age??? Take some personal responsibility for your investments. Who guaranteed you anything?
8846 2018-03-24 10:56:07 Please stop with your own brand of fake news. No one legalized bump stocks. Bump stocks were technology that was never regulated. I can say this for you sir, You enjoy pointing the finger.
8847 2018-03-24 10:55:45 #MarchForOurLives won’t give any credit to @realDonaldTrump for banning bump stocks/anything that can turn weapons into machine guns or the other parts of the #STOPSchoolViolenceAct today

It’s gonna be one big “Anti Trump/NRA/Republican rally disguised as “pro-gun control”

8856 2018-03-24 10:50:47 BUT! You still signed it. I wonder why!?! Somethings up! They have something that made you fold. So very disappointed. ;( did you see our stocks after you signed? 3 big things you said you'd do. Now gone.
8857 2018-03-24 10:50:33 president trump sign the spending bill to keep the government open and president trump knew the stocks would drop and plus president trump love the military that why he sign it and i still support president trump
8858 2018-03-24 10:50:10 @realDonaldTrump 
You are not backing the NRA or True Americans. Banding bump stocks is not the answer. Refunding mental health hospitals is the answer. Turning your back on law bidding gun owners will effect your election 2020
8859 2018-03-24 10:49:12 Huge supporter here. The only issue is you can bump fire with your belt loops. bipod, rubber band no bump stocks needed. Can’t ban everything.

8861 2018-03-24 10:48:48 Well bump stocks are not hard to manufacture so banning them only creates contempt for the law. And maybe if the FBI weren't keystones kops then data that should be in nics would be.
8862 2018-03-24 10:48:41 The HR lady at my work said you can call the company that does your 401k and move the money to less risky stocks. Is that what you are talking about? I think I'm going to stop putting money in my 401k for the next two years lol

8869 2018-03-24 10:43:30 @realDonaldTrump why bother? Every E0 you sign is destroying democracy. Bump stocks are part of a rifle. To remove the cancer you need to cut out the whole rifle! It would be like removing Ivanka from White House. Every Trump has to be removed to rid the country of Trump disease
8870 2018-03-24 10:43:01 You don't need to amend the Constitution to institute universal background checks or bans on bump-stocks. But you do need to tell the NRA to shove it.

8880 2018-03-24 10:38:56 I would suspect that a lot of people won't have a clue and that many will end up paying more than they should because of the emotional aspects and desires of buying and selling properties.
8881 2018-03-24 10:38:11 Consequently, the Federal Government "cannot tell Texas or Florida" it has to "ban bump stocks," i.e., even if it had a legitimate government interest in doing so. 

Unlike each U.S. State's Police Power, the Federal Government does have a legally recognized "police power."
8882 2018-03-24 10:37:44 @RealAlexJones hey alex why are you stabbing president trump in the back you should know by now that president trump is smart and you know trump sign the bill to keep the government open and knew the stocks would drop

8884 2018-03-24 10:36:52 Wrong. Bump stocks - never regulated. 
ATF decides NFA renders any regulation attempt against Bump stocks) unenforceable. Bump stocks aren’t regulated by NFA & never were. Remember that when you rescinded Obama regs that kept mentally ill from owning a gun? Those in glass houses
8885 2018-03-24 10:34:38 "PA school district stocks classrooms with rocks to combat school shooters." Wonder how many students could be shot by the time they all rush to the buckets, grab rocks, lift their arms & aim at shooter firing rifle & just stand there to throw rocks instead of running for cover.
8886 2018-03-24 10:33:16 John Spencer of the ATF is the guy that found that bump stocks didn’t violate Federal law. I don’t know how he could have arrived at such a conclusion. But he is the dude.
8887 2018-03-24 10:33:09 What part of 'amendment' do you not understand? It means it's an alteration. Laws can and do change to make them more fit for purpose for their time. 2nd amendment is 230 years old and was not made with high powered weapons, bump stocks and high school shootings in mind.

8890 2018-03-24 10:31:12 There is some truth to stock buy backs. Tax cuts give consumers confidence to finance and go further in debt.
Which companies ie: car manufacturers get to sell cars and collect  higher finance interest (rates will go up). Then there stocks will increase in value.
8891 2018-03-24 10:30:59 You are a fool. No full automatic or bump stocks were used in the recent school shootings. You confirmed that you are a fool today by signing the omnibus spending bill. What a disappointment. I don’t know why the media is so up in arms over stormy, you just screwed All America

8893 2018-03-24 10:30:18 FYI - Congress needs to change the law if you want to ban “Bump Stocks”. You do not have the power to change a law unless you want to be like Obama and not care about the Constitution.

8902 2018-03-24 10:26:25 banning bump stocks is a waste of time and won't save 1 life. you are handing Democrats a victory in return for nothing at all
8903 2018-03-24 10:26:24 Stocks around the world plunged Friday as investors feared that a trade conflict between the U.S. and China, the biggest economies in the world, would escalate. A second day of big losses pushed U.S. stocks to their worst week in two years.

8906 2018-03-24 10:23:46 Hi there! if you're looking for pixi glow tonic 250ml or TO Glycolic Acid I have both in stocks :)
8907 2018-03-24 10:22:19 You're correct, I misspoke. Should've said assault rifles. To my understanding that's what the kids are pushing for. Assault rifles bans, bump stocks and similar devices. More background checks. Not all guns period. Seems sensible to me but I don't live in fear of too many things
8908 2018-03-24 10:21:41 You fucking liar. Obama had nothing to do with approving bump stocks. The ATF determined in 2010 since bump stocks don’t have any moving parts, they were a legal part of a gun. The Obama admin was not involved at all because bump stocks were not considered a problem then.
8909 2018-03-24 10:21:41 #AMJOY This weekend there will be more BREAKING NEWS from Trump,to offset the Stormy Daniels 60 minutes interview. Maybe even him firing Mueller. But I bet it will be something big.He's already did the Transgenders in the military. Then the bump stocks. So stay tuned.
8910 2018-03-24 10:20:46 Hi there! I ada yang 250ml in stocks already if you're still looking for one :)
8911 2018-03-24 10:20:32 No. Carrots-for-brains, The ATF under Obama found that bump stocks were Not Regulated By Law. Therefore, unless a regulation was passed against bump stocks, there was no legal way to ban them. You THINK Americans are Stupid???

8918 2018-03-24 10:16:28 As an owner of an AR-15 I am in full agreeance with the ban of bump stocks and anything else that makes a semi-automatic weapon an automatic weapon.  There is NO place for these in civilized society as they only serve one purpose, killing at a maximum rate.

8923 2018-03-24 10:14:17 Many stocks which broke out 8-9 years range and jumped 40-50% will surely come back to break out point to again make fresh highs once dust settles at 9500. But if S&P500 falls to 2200 in worst case then Nifty may come back to 8500 ultimately.

8926 2018-03-24 10:13:40 How is that relevant to the post as it's not about investing apprsently.

But on the subject of fees, investing costs money but fees are more transparent than ever. Surely the bottom line is more about the growth you earn net of fees and taxes?

8929 2018-03-24 10:12:22 Hey @krassenstein correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't something have to have been illegal in order for it to be legalized? For example: In order for the Obama Administration to have legalized bump stocks, bump stocks would have had to have been illegal at the time.
8930 2018-03-24 10:12:08 Yeah really good mate, both sides missing players aswell. Good to see a bit of niggle in the game, what derbys should be like

8935 2018-03-24 10:10:52 And so it begins.........The stock market just finished up its worst week in 2 years, apparently due to concerns over trade.  Hopefully, Donny's stocks fell faster and farther than the rest since he's creating the problem. Recession, here we come.

8944 2018-03-24 10:06:18 I've made it, and sat down with friends -- real people -- not the NRA, and many of them are willing to make concessions on bump stocks, background checks and more. Treating them as if they are the same as the mass shooters or stupid doesn't get very far. Thanks.

8956 2018-03-24 09:57:26 Yeah im sure. My point was bump stocks take a little bit of work/practice.

8961 2018-03-24 09:51:45 No more NRA money for you Donnie.  Haven't you heard? Bump stocks, like ICBM's,  are covered under the 2nd amendment.  All citizens should be free to buy the weapons of their choice.  Personally, I want a nuke sub.  Very fast and more fuel efficient then my Prius.
8962 2018-03-24 09:50:54 However, as bump stocks do NOT change legal firearms at all, this is utter nonsense. The Second amendment prohibits such BANS  This is endangering the USA and reflects a lack of input by knowledgeable people who actually support the Second Amendment and oppose Globalism.
8963 2018-03-24 09:48:52 So how come when congress brought up the issue of bump stocks after the Vegas shooting you did nothing?
8964 2018-03-24 09:45:17 @BBCNews please get your facts right. Bump stocks do not enable “normal” rifles to become automatic. They enable a faster repeated pull of the trigger, but does not make them automatic.

8967 2018-03-24 09:43:13 Let's not forget that our own ATF and DOJ came to the legal opinion that one could not restrict bump stocks without legislative action from Congress, just like Dianne Feinstein has maintained.

8980 2018-03-24 09:27:32 Bumps stocks are not and were never even thought of at the time  the 2nd ammendment was written and signed.  Too all who are trying to use the 2nd ammendment as an excuse against the banning of bump stocks .  Please have a good long think about it.
8981 2018-03-24 09:27:21 Bump stocks don’t make semi-automatic weapons into automatics Mr. President. They allow the trigger to be pulled in rapid succession. No “real” shooter would ever use one except for fun because they’re inaccurate and hard to keep on target. Feel good legislation does nothing.
8982 2018-03-24 09:26:59 He needs to be put in stocks in the village square, or male version of the scarlet letter. Blight on the human gene pool.
8983 2018-03-24 09:24:07 Trump seems proud that he banned bump stocks.  That won’t stop one killer, but I guess he thinks that’s the way to go forward, but I see it as another step to remove 2nd amend.

8994 2018-03-24 09:18:57 @realDonaldTrump Obama didn’t legalize bump stocks. Republicans did and before Obama took office, it was legalized. Don’t make shit up
8995 2018-03-24 09:18:41 No administration approved bump stocks. There was a determination by ATF that the device did not violate current law, still doesn’t BTW. #TrumpNews=FakeNews #MAGA #NoCollision
8996 2018-03-24 09:17:46 You know we can ALL fact check your bullshit, right? 

You should REALLY listen to, and watch the people who show up tomorrow to support the overwhelmingly popular idea of banning assault rifles, bump stocks, closing the gun show loophole, and creating sensible gun control laws.

9003 2018-03-24 09:14:01 The new policy, announced Thursday, prohibits the sale of firearms to customers who have not passed a background check or who are younger than 21. It also bars the sale of bump stocks and high-capacity magazines.

9006 2018-03-24 09:12:24 Wonder if Trump fortunes have fallen.  On then other hand he and his comrades could be tanking the market so they can buy the devalued stocks. Hmm.
9007 2018-03-24 09:10:35 Personally Mr President, I do not believe that any modifications for any gun makes a difference to the mentally murderous mind. Why outlaw the bump stocks or any modifications. With all do respect, gun laws change nothing.
9008 2018-03-24 09:09:54 So then it's of no use at all? Why do you defend it then? 
I'm pretty sure, that Trump wants to ban Bump stocks only, because even the NRA does not get angry about it. It is kind of sedative for the people who request  detailed gun regulations.
9009 2018-03-24 09:08:56 NO one or group legalized bump stocks.  Your commitment to this banning just shows another one of your areas of ignorance.  FYI - All auto-fire  conversions are ALREADY BANNED.  Here is another area!!

9025 2018-03-24 08:50:00 PTN MAIS LES MECS QUI DÉCIDENT DES STOCKS ILS LE FONT AVEC LE CUL C'EST INSENSÉ
9026 2018-03-24 08:47:42 Obama admin didn't legalize bump stocks, you lying sack of shit. Current law prevented him from regulating bump stocks. The ATF would have to change its interpretation of the firearms act, or new legislation allowing for regulation is needed.
9027 2018-03-24 08:47:23 I've heard white people make me wish i invested in woke stocks.
9028 2018-03-24 08:45:08 We can make it brighter. 1 round per logical input.  THAT eliminates bump stocks, where the trigger pull is "faked" by the gun itself as part of cyclic fire.  It's a fine point, but once you see that it eliminates bump stocks, you also see it eliminates triggers to PROTECT them.

9035 2018-03-24 08:40:33 I listened to HOURS of videos and recordings of bump stocks and various machine guns starting on the night of the Vegas shootings, and the thing that struck me most is how it was almost impossible to tell them apart - particularly after a person is "good" with their bump stock.

9039 2018-03-24 08:38:06 If semi-auto and full auto are LOGICALLY defined - not MECHANICALLY defined - then they track with human common sense, and cannot be played by the communists, who tried to make gun owners adopt the "non-common-sense" position on bump stocks. It was a REALLY good psy-op by them.

9041 2018-03-24 08:34:42 After im done with my vacation at anime expo im gonna start investing in some stocks
9042 2018-03-24 08:34:35 Really want to learn about stocks and investments. 
9043 2018-03-24 08:34:16 Well, I'll explain tomorrow, but I'm saying SAVE the current definition by making it BETTER and simpler, and ELIMINATING rate of fire from the debate. A clearer definition of semi-auto eliminates bump stocks, but also eliminates rate of fire as a CRITERION. See what I'm saying?
9044 2018-03-24 08:33:12 Concentrate on keeping criminals in prison, get these illegals out, and let the states protect their schools.  It's already illegal to convert a semi auto into a machinegun.  Bump stocks do not do that.  Maybe learn the law and you will fail less at negotiating with anti gunners.
9045 2018-03-24 08:31:31 These decisions allowed two companies to sell bump stocks. It’s  important to note this was not a statement of Obama’s preferred policy,  which called for more regulation of guns, but was what the agency  determined it had to do under the language of current law.
9046 2018-03-24 08:31:17 The NRA said, "The Obama administration approved the sale of bump fire stocks on at least two occasions."
  We indeed found two occasions in which ATF, a bureau within the  executive branch, decided it could not regulate bump stocks during the  Obama administration.

9052 2018-03-24 08:19:56 Yes, people can do this - they can ENGINEER a semi-auto device to full auto using simple machines, and in fact this is exactly what bump stocks do.  In any case, it is the ACT of full auto fire which should be regulated, assuming that is in fact the legal intent of the NFA.

9054 2018-03-24 08:13:14 Friday my bump in stocks were melted.
9055 2018-03-24 08:13:04 Bump stocks are NOT semi-auto by my definition.  I would not ban them - I would make them NFA (that's a whole nuther argument - and I hear you).  They're just another form of full auto (albeit a kind of crappy one) by any of my logical approaches to analyzing the situation.
9056 2018-03-24 08:12:53 I wouldnt waste my very hard-earned coppers on it. It is written by a Remainer who sees his stocks and shares dropping, not one who worries about where the foodbank is. It is about the personal political machinations and backstabbing, normal people dont CARE.
9057 2018-03-24 08:12:09 Ur idea is a bad idea. Bump stocks don't kill. Guns don't kill. People kill with a bomb car knife or gun. Banning law-abiding citizens is a leberal thing to do. Disappointed... again.
9058 2018-03-24 08:11:38 unlike paper assets or "inflationary papers" stocks, bonds and others which are driven by financial statements and political decisions, Bitcoin si driven by HODLERS and objectivists. Huge difference right?

9069 2018-03-24 08:04:42 The ATF responded to manufacturers saying that, because bump stocks didn’t mechanically pull the trigger (human finger needs to be in position), they were technically legal

Obama wasn’t involved in the determinations, & it probably wasn’t brought to his attention, but not great

9074 2018-03-24 07:57:37 I am beginning to think that the broader conspiracy to grab the guns was DESIGNED to include bump stocks, and that Vegas and Parkland are intimately tied together in that order. We were SUPPOSED to defend bump stocks in Vegas, to LOSE CREDIBILITY after Parkland. It was a SET-UP.

9079 2018-03-24 07:54:04 I can think of MULTIPLE ways to fix the definition of semi-auto which would properly eliminate bump stocks while actually ENHANCING protection for gun owners, even into the future, with triggerless guns.  If they don't see this stuff, I think it may actually be intentional.

9086 2018-03-24 07:46:54 A close look at the physics/engineering of bump stocks show that they are a weird loophole that violates the rule in an extremely subtle fashion by some interpretations, but not by others, and which circumvents machine gun definitions and rules in a similar way.

9088 2018-03-24 07:43:25 Bump stocks is also the name of a sex act Donald Trump will perform with prostitutes when the DOW crashes.
9089 2018-03-24 07:40:34 The Obama Administration did not legalize bump stocks.  They determined that since bump stocks do not alter the internal mechanisms of the weapon then the law did not apply to bump stocks.  Try doing some reading instead of using a very loose NRA talking point that is misleading.
9090 2018-03-24 07:39:45 Wrong, sad, fake news.  LOL The great @POTUS44 followed the law, despite his distaste for bump-stocks.  You have rolled back all of the good gun control that he put in place.  #FakePresident

9110 2018-03-24 07:21:23 It's an interesting point WD. Potential explaination is that ultra low interest rates and bond yields have made stocks comparatively attractive which in turn pushes up PEs etc. As rates normalise  companies may trade at lower PEs. It could be the cause of this pullback.

9159 2018-03-24 06:52:17 No it does not. No where does it say anything about bump stocks in the Constitution. It talks about guns.
9160 2018-03-24 06:51:42 ATF can only regulate firearms, ammunition, and explosives. Bump stocks are neither. It’s up to congress to create new laws.
9161 2018-03-24 06:50:14 this is the country that wants to bomb Syria becaouse of chemical warfare stocks
9162 2018-03-24 06:49:54 Law abiding gun owners care about laws though and bump stocks are niche enough that people wouldn't want to even risk getting federal charges over something like that. It's just a sudden and unnecessary move.
9163 2018-03-24 06:48:39 Bump stocks are now banned. The American people took on the NRA and we won.

9165 2018-03-24 06:44:03 Yes, it stabilized an economy, caused it to surge, and kept inflation in check. Not sure how it was a bad thing. You sound like Trump bickering about her. 'We have a fed who's bubbling up the stocks, but it'll pop' 'oh look what I've done to the stocks'
9166 2018-03-24 06:42:50 President Obama did not legalise bump stocks, you just cannot stop lying to save your life can you?
9167 2018-03-24 06:42:35 Land is more fun to own than stocks. There’s a reason it’s called “real” estate. When you own land, you have the foundation to dream, plan and build your new home when the time is right. #NgongCrescentOpenDay give you an amazing opportunity to own one.

9169 2018-03-24 06:41:18 This is a lie. 

The Obama administration didn't legalize bump stocks. 

Obama issued EOs creating stricter controls (all of which Trump has rolled back), but could not legally restrict (non mechanical) bump stocks without new laws. Congress refused.
9170 2018-03-24 06:40:26 If one is new to mkts it wud be difficult. But ppl like u n me who have seen 2000 and 2008 wud know by now which approach works for us. But ya i agree after such a mad bull run one has to be v selective about which stocks to stay invested in.

9177 2018-03-24 06:35:32 @bbcworldservice just announced that “ bump stocks turn guns into machine guns “.  idiots.
9178 2018-03-24 06:34:23 That is true. But the biggest multibaggers were illiquid when they were penny stocks. For example, Vipul, Hester Biosciences, Bhansali Engg.

You people f**ed us up.
9180 2018-03-24 06:33:48 Oooh, banning bump stocks, the only thing the NRA is okay with. How bold of you. But why did you change your mind on increasing the age to 21 after meeting with the NRA, who is against it? "You're afraid of the NRA."
9181 2018-03-24 06:32:45 Not worried about stocks. Just getting the traitor  out of white house before he does more harm than he already has on all other fronts.
9182 2018-03-24 06:31:52 Even the NRA support a ban on bump stocks. Big deal! Now bring in some really effective gun legislation to save tens of thousands of American citizens every year.
9183 2018-03-24 06:31:29 @realDonaldTrump, please continue to make good decisions like this. Automatic guns, or any accessories like bump stocks that make a gun automatic, have no place in society.
9184 2018-03-24 06:31:26 #@nitinbhatia121  sir pl let us know the list of you actual stocks
9185 2018-03-24 06:30:21 Obama did not legalize bump-stocks. They were already legal by the ATF's own definition of what a machine gun is as apposed to what a semi automatic firearm is. How are you going to appease the anti gunners next Mr President? Ban semi automatic firearms as well?
9186 2018-03-24 06:28:29 よーし、決まり！
9187 2018-03-24 06:26:31 I mean ppl who do business shouldn't they put like "while stock last" ???? If they have limited stocks ???? Like wtf. Giving false hope to some people
9188 2018-03-24 06:25:43 Dont forget, Columbine happened when AR15 were banned. The only shooting where "mass killing" fits is Vegas & that's bc bump stocks. Also the long range handgun wouldn't have worked.
9189 2018-03-24 06:25:37 It's impossible to legalize a firearm component when it is not inclined by the National Firearms Act, which is why your introducing legislation for regulations on bump stocks. #FACEPALM
9190 2018-03-24 06:25:20 Instead of illegalization of bump stocks, what about assault weapons in general?Even you and your family while hunting tusks, if used an assault weapon to gather elephant tusks, you wouldn't have animal or tusks left. BTW why are you now allowing killing almost extinct elephants?
9191 2018-03-24 06:25:02 Bump stocks are a joke . I would fight a guy with a bump stock with a semi anything. The bump stocks are unreliable
9192 2018-03-24 06:22:54 The AR15 is certainly an effective weapon. I don't think it's a super weapon worthy of a ban. There are too many other similar options. But I'm ok with age of 21. Automatics are significantly greater firepower & IMO should be banned. Bump stocks shoukd never have happened.
9193 2018-03-24 06:22:53 Fair question. Two hypotheses:
1. The limited # of DVRs in India so far, there hasn't been enough awareness
2. Dividend yield of stocks here is low, so a 5% bump doesn't offer enough incentive
9194 2018-03-24 06:22:40 This is what happens when you try to extend existing laws... what we need is new legislation focused specifically on bump stocks... but the GOP has no stomach for this kind of legislation.

9196 2018-03-24 06:22:14 Bump stocks can be made from anything you have to be dumb not to realize that. With that said why where you so dumb to pass this ridiculous budget! I thought we where draining the swamp you just made it deeper!
9197 2018-03-24 06:22:14 Not necessarily. I’ve tried checking & done some researching myself but wasn’t quite sure what the difference was when it comes to stock vesting.... I’m rewarded stocks that are set to vest later tis year & in mid 2019

9199 2018-03-24 06:20:10 remove assault rifles, bump stocks better background checks that look for mentally ill people. or persons on certain drugs for mental health lower clips bump the law to 21 same as drinking. when you buy guns it allows feds to know what you buy do the same with bullets and so on .

9201 2018-03-24 06:19:52 Actually, during the Obama administration,  ATF determined that bump stocks did not constitute machine guns... Obama played no part in that determination.  Legally it is questionable whether this new interpretation will hold up in court....

9207 2018-03-24 06:16:27 Bump stocks, however, let semi automatics simulate full automatics. An everyday Joe doesn't really need a bump stock, do they?
9208 2018-03-24 06:14:48 Yeah my thoughts exactly, what bothered me was that it's not just a ban on sales going forward, you have to turn in the bump stocks.

9213 2018-03-24 06:13:00 Your analogy fails, drop in 3lb trigger is much more effective than bump stocks...
9214 2018-03-24 06:10:39 even stocks bought at attractive valuation but whose price has run up fast will correct a lot. But if the business is good and has a long runway ahead, there is no problem adding. Or simply sitting tight if fully invested.
9215 2018-03-24 06:10:35 That isn’t what bulb stocks do with all due respect mr President you go t this one wrong. You put out a stepping stone for them to gun ban

9217 2018-03-24 06:10:05 YOU ALWAYS LIE ABOUT EVERYTHING...OBAMA DID NOT APPROVE BUMP STOCKS BECAUSE TO BEGIN WITH THE RACIST ALL WHITE REPUBLICAN PARTY VETOED EVERYTHING HE TRIED TO PASS SO QUIT WITH THE BULLSHIT AND QUIT TAKING CREDIT FOR THE GOOD THINGS THAT OBAMA DID
9218 2018-03-24 06:09:26 Ok, maybe you don't know how bump stocks work so I'll enlighten you bump stocks increase the shot fired by a gun it is employed on, but at a turn on feature, not an automatic one. This ban will snarl up the courts for years remaining available to all. So your ban: meaningless
9219 2018-03-24 06:09:24 But the logic is in short term picks we have to be right 10-15 times to make 200%. Also it will be extremely difficult for novice investors to keep finding regularly such stocks

9222 2018-03-24 06:08:53 Correct bump stocks first off aren’t “legalized” and second Obama didn’t do anything regarding making guns more unsafe Obama tried for years calling on tougher gun control only for GOP to stand in the way!
9223 2018-03-24 06:08:19 Can can!! I just hope Pledis produce enough stocks!!
9224 2018-03-24 06:06:46 Story = equities Don't always outperform bonds over long term. Not that difficult
9225 2018-03-24 06:06:37 You lie all the time. Bump stocks were never legalized, they've been in the grey zone and in use long before Obama's presidency. You are a disgrace. #RESIGN
9226 2018-03-24 06:06:31 Great idea to ban bump stocks! Trump is the only President willing to stand up to the NRA and the NRA hawks in his own party that oppose all gun regulations ! The Democrats TALK about gun control, but at the end of the day, they usually VOTE the other way.
9227 2018-03-24 06:06:18 Investors are worried with market going lower and lower and I am excited with every major decline.
 
Investors are not interested in looking for their stocks price and I am keenly looking for any major declines so as to buy more

#apexcapitalist
9228 2018-03-24 06:06:17 Or FAANG stocks tumble, but impact will be less than in case of other possibilities.
9229 2018-03-24 06:04:39 Bump stocks were never illegal. A company that was going to make them decided to ask the ATF first to make sure they weren't illegal, and the ATF said the bump stocks weren't subject to "regulation". That's what happened regardless of what Trump said.
9230 2018-03-24 06:03:03 Ima just keep my stocks
9231 2018-03-24 06:02:30 they dropped the laws about assault rifles and now they are making laws about bump stocks you don't need they to hunt anything but humans
9232 2018-03-24 06:02:14 Barack!

"Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA. As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns."

9239 2018-03-24 05:57:05 Bump stocks don't turn guns into machine guns. Per LAW, machine guns fire more than one round per pull of the trigger. You're either going to need to change the law or change the meaning of simple words like "per" and "pull" and "one". Lots of luck on either course of action bub.

Thanks for the help in advance

9242 2018-03-24 05:54:32 No, once again you desperately try to skew the facts. Bump stocks were found to not violate federal law during Obama's admin which is quite different from what you are trying to say. 

Why does the strong, caring, handsome, intelligent black man scare you so much?
9243 2018-03-24 05:53:01 Ban assault weapons, bump stocks, and large capacity magazines.

9258 2018-03-24 05:42:22 Trump is getting gun laws push through and encouraging states to do them. Bump stocks, Fix NICS and all the states raising or trying to raise the age for rifles to 21 and banning assault weapons. They are following his lead, he's making it easy for them.

The Obama Asministration legalized bump stocks and democrats are blaming Trump for a lack of gun control

9263 2018-03-24 05:38:50 Individually, stocks will still perform on their merits. I'm not selling a stock I expect to outperform just because of a trade spat that will probably benefit Oz anyway as we've been explicitly excluded by Trump as Chinese flock here to invest capital to circumvent the issue.

9269 2018-03-24 05:33:53 @POTUS disappointed with you today. Today I am ashamed I voted for you. I believed your lies on being Second Amendment champion. Banning bump stocks are a pandora box to future loss of my rights. Give them an inch, they use it to take a mile. Betrayed!
9270 2018-03-24 05:31:51 Haha David Leyonhjelm - Even Jeff Sessions from TrumpLand is putting forward a bill TO BAN BUMP STOCKS
9271 2018-03-24 05:30:41 Yep. And, pinning it on Obama is silly. ATF reviewed bump stocks and determined they didn't violate the law. So Trump's going to ban a device that doesn't turn a legal firearm into an illegal firearm, Faggot. Also, bump stocks are gay.

9278 2018-03-24 05:28:21 Just one question - since calif and other states are not obeying federal law, can the state pick and choose to follow bump stocks? Otherwise make the states follow the federal law......
9279 2018-03-24 05:28:13 Aren’t there like 3 different “just this thing” pushes right now? When you want to ban AR-15s, bump stocks, and “assault rifles” all at the same time, it’s difficult to take the “just this one thing” argument seriously.
9280 2018-03-24 05:28:01 No money for the wall, and illegals kill more Americans a year than all the bump stocks in America combined have seance there invention. How about you keep your other promises. Not just the one's you made to the leftist
9281 2018-03-24 05:27:45 Another lie, Obama did not legalize bump stocks.
9282 2018-03-24 05:27:41 Obama knew he couldn't legally ban bump stocks without Congress passing a law, cause bump stocks are parts, not guns, & ATF can only regulate guns. Trump knows this & knows his "ban" will just get overruled in the courts

9284 2018-03-24 05:26:39 But since he couldn't do it, he facilitated things that would make gun owners look bad, like allowing bump stocks, & arming Mexican drug cartels....
9285 2018-03-24 05:26:29 i mean, last year they did invest in skt iriver and keyeast... its like they earn all those money but they decided to buy stocks for long term plan since it seems SM future plan is to become more like cjem

The banning of bump stocks his parting gift to marchers since he'll be on the golf course.
9287 2018-03-24 05:23:46 As usual, you've got it wrong. The Obama Administration didn't legalize bump stocks, they just couldn't prohibit it because of the way the laws were written. What you stated is NRA propaganda which you're, of course, passing on.
9288 2018-03-24 05:23:38 Everyone has access to the information but only @Trendmyfriends Sir knows how to analyse it better. Hats off to this amazing person. His brilliant trading system is a must follow for every active trader. Be it stocks, commodity or currency, he is the bellwether. #Respect

9293 2018-03-24 05:20:53 @realDonaldTrump Mr President Thank you for all that you do. Capitol gains tax on stocks should be a flat 15%. Make that happen and you will see DOW 40,000. Also, not allowing students who didn't land a good job and are financially ruined to declare bankruptcy is a horrible law.

9304 2018-03-24 05:13:35 @realDonaldTrump doesn’t give a s**t about bumps stocks. He just has a pathological need to reverse anything done in the Obama administration.

9309 2018-03-24 05:11:47 So do you deliberately make it sound like the previous administration chose to legalize bump stocks rather than conceding that they could not be regulated as a firearm because you know that your fans will buy it? Like it was their idea? WTF is wrong with you?

9315 2018-03-24 05:08:06 I added Lockheed, and Raytheon today. I had Raytheon, but added Lockheed once I heard Trump signed another bill for construction of military equipment. China retaliatory tariffs wont affect those two defense/military stocks, or Netflix.
9316 2018-03-24 05:07:36 I agree. Who needs bump stocks? No one really.
9317 2018-03-24 05:07:19 Step back. Bump stocks are not the issue.  The issue is citizens left defenseless.
9318 2018-03-24 05:07:06 President Obama signed the Bill pasting "Bump Stocks". President Trump signed the executive order outlawing "Bump Stocks".

9324 2018-03-24 05:03:59 1) That’s not what bump stocks do.

2) For that reason you cannot do that, Constitutionally.

3) You’re messing up really bad. If you aren’t careful — you haven’t been — you’re going to see Congress run by Democrats in 2019 and have no chance in hell by 2020.

You were warned.
9325 2018-03-24 05:03:50 Thats wrong! Not that Im a fan of bump stocks; however, they dont make a semi-auto into an automatic! It still pulls the trigger 1 bullet at a time...any law is an infringement to my rights, the same ones you promised to uphold and protect!
9326 2018-03-24 05:03:47 Everything going down for the most part, as the market, as whole is going doing. But I've sold off & took my profits when I can. Then start buying certain stocks again as they dip (cheaper); add things when you can
9327 2018-03-24 05:03:14 Trump tweeted that Obama 'legalized bump stocks.' Is he right?...
9328 2018-03-24 05:03:11 Nobody cares about freakin bump stocks. What we DO care about, is not borrowing money from China to pay for sex changes for trannies in our military.
9329 2018-03-24 05:02:19 Adam Winkler, a constitutional law professor at the U of CA, told PolitiFact that it is accurate to say the Obama admin approved the sale of bumps stocks, "Not because they liked it, but because the law did not permit them to prohibit it."
9330 2018-03-24 05:02:19 Obviously not 1 for 1. If the expected return for stocks is negative, and crypto positive then you’d certainly could see a rotation. Depending on risk sensitivity they’d have to hedge it or buy a good amount of bonds to reduce the volatility
9331 2018-03-24 05:01:56 Bump stocks are already banned in my great state of California. #FollowTheGoldenState
9332 2018-03-24 05:01:26 Complete nonsense to use this criteria. Jubilant Food was bleeding 1 and half year back when whole market was moving up. Same was with IT stocks.

9339 2018-03-24 04:58:41 So what are you saying? Assault Rifles and their accessories should have been banned by Obama? Are you saying you should have banned both following the October massacre in Nevada? Are you saying you’re banning both ARs and Bump Stocks? Or are you simply bashing Obama?
9340 2018-03-24 04:58:16 That he is.  Banning bump stocks will cost the weapons industry mega profits, not to mention the waste of destroying it's current inventory unless they export it all to other countries.  The #NRA probably blew a gasket when they caught wind of this.  Serves them right!

9349 2018-03-24 04:50:25 In 2010 the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives determined that because bump stocks don't have any moving parts, they are a "firearm part" and could not be regulated as a firearm under existing gun laws. The ATF reached a similar conclusion in 2012.
9350 2018-03-24 04:49:26 Shitty analogy... (at least w/ regards to Vegas shooting) banning bump stocks because you hate gun violence is like banning distortion pedals because you hate punk.
9351 2018-03-24 04:48:56 @realDonaldTrump 
Kinda sorta...the ATF, a bureau within the executive branch, decided it could not regulate bump stocks during the Obama administration. The ‘bump-stock’ is a firearm part and is not regulated as a firearm under Gun Control Act or the National Firearms Act.

Why aren’t you “dancing” with YouTube?
9358 2018-03-24 04:46:13 Regarding 2nd Ammendment, I could go either way on bump stocks; they function almost like fully auto, so I don't much care. But he was never seriously going to consider raising the age limit to 21 or go along w Democrat inspired background checks. Though after today, I question.
9359 2018-03-24 04:46:05 Kinda sorta...on two occasions the ATF, a bureau within the executive branch, decided it could not regulate bump stocks during the Obama administration. So the ‘bump-stock’ is a firearm part and is not regulated as a firearm under Gun Control Act or the National Firearms Act.

Bill Clinton's restriction on my rights in 1986 made full autos cost tens of thousands of dollars. Bump stocks are as close as most Americans can ever get.

It's obvious you don't care about the second amendment.

9381 2018-03-24 04:33:53 Nooo. There wasn't a legal means to stop the manufacture of bump stocks. Obama Admin. did put out a number of executive orders for stricter gun control. You rescinded those. #Trump #LiarInChief #bumpstocks #Obama

9384 2018-03-24 04:32:27 Looks like Obama admin intentionally and fairly secretly legalized bump stocks to entice a mass murder to fan Leftist fires against Second Amendment.

9388 2018-03-24 04:30:02 Ah pardon  me but the problem with your tweet is that bump stocks never were illegal  no one had to "legalize" them.  why do you lie so much
9389 2018-03-24 04:29:01 And what about all the bump stocks already in civilian hands?  I'm sure they'll all come running to turn them in.  This idea sounds about as good as the budget you just signed, HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.

9394 2018-03-24 04:25:04 Our problem is they demand restrictions, we demand to have nothing happen. Natural comprise is to accept small scale restrictions.

For example, bump stocks.

Every time they demand restrictions to amendments, we need to demand expansions to it.

Theirs is the only side fighting.

9400 2018-03-24 04:22:43 I hope Trdumbp's own valueless stocks free falls by 70-80% since he crazily started all these stupid trade wars with Europe China Canada etc.i.e with world (expcept Russia) most probably his stocks falling to Pennie's from 1.5 billion worth or so he had
9401 2018-03-24 04:22:33 Adam Winkler, a constitutional law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, told PolitiFact that it is accurate to say the Obama administration approved the sale of bumps stocks. 
"Not because they liked it, but because the law did not permit them to prohibit it,"

9404 2018-03-24 04:20:14 ATF determined that some bump stocks didn't fall under the definition of firearms that are regulated.  That's quite a bit different from "legalizing" them.
9405 2018-03-24 04:20:12 Boy you don't ever hear the news report that Obama legalize bump stocks ...hell no..
9406 2018-03-24 04:20:06 Pretty lame.  It isn't guns vs no guns.  Most people just don't want assault rifles and bump stocks on the street. We want real background checks and out of the hands of dangerous folks.  These are all fought tooth and nail by the NRA.
9407 2018-03-24 04:20:04 So escort review sites are harmful to the public but bump stocks and AR-15s aren't.  Got it.
9408 2018-03-24 04:19:48 BAD IDEA BUMP STOCKS BAN

what yall expect from a fandom that said dubai>US in terms of music market, cant take a metaphor phrase, accusing korean for didnt understand korean, cant tell the difference between profit and stocks, so as a human with brain, we must understand.

9411 2018-03-24 04:16:49 I like my stocks even more when "no one is talking about it"! 

Even better if the promoters are a silent lot and just go about their business of running the company & not talking up the share price

9413 2018-03-24 04:16:12 The reason why bump stocks are still legal is that there is no reason they should be illegal other than knee jerk reactions from people who don't know what they are talking about.

9415 2018-03-24 04:15:01 P.S. Mr @realDonaldTrump can you tell me which drug companies your suing so I can sell my stocks and ones I can soon buy at a discount before these drug companies all go back to what they were doing prior to the slap on the wrist??? Great thing! Let's make some Drug Money!
9416 2018-03-24 04:14:29 Chinese stocks crash as China announces retaliatory tariff against Trump. Fantastic.
9417 2018-03-24 04:14:20 I think it refering to bump stocks and similar types of things... Anything that mimics full auto firing.
9418 2018-03-24 04:14:09 You don’t need “bump stocks” to bump-fire semiautomatic small arms; this is the foot in the door to hosing it all!

SCREW YOU!
9419 2018-03-24 04:13:50 Bump stocks do not turn guns into machine guns. I suppose you don't care about facts or educating yourself as long as the ultimate goal of disarming the people is achieved.   #Hitler
9420 2018-03-24 04:13:38 That's why bumpfire stocks are out.

It gets joe lunchbucket too close to NFA for Uncle Sam's comfort.
9421 2018-03-24 04:13:37 Trump voters must be very confused today he pisses them of by  signing the spending bill, then bans bump stocks...then he caters to their hate by banning transgender troops again. Is he bipolar?

9423 2018-03-24 04:12:49 Thanks for this. I trust him regarding this, even before reading this nice write-up. The thing I'm confused about is bump stocks.
9424 2018-03-24 04:11:51 you cannot have shootings if the perpetrator cannot get a gun. simple as that. we are trying to get sensible gun reform that involves universal background checks, banning of bump stocks, banning high capacity magazines, better mental health, etc. we are not taking your guns, 1/2
9425 2018-03-24 04:11:42 This is actually what that stupid Senator was getting at when he said that "gas assisted receiver firearms" should be banned.  He was obviously being pushed to complain about gas operated reloading.  That is the next thing they will push against once bump stocks are banned.
9426 2018-03-24 04:10:44 BUMP STOCKS SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE AFTER VEGAS SHOOTING ! FIXING THE AGE LIMIT, FIXING THE LOOP HOLES IN THE BACKGROUND CHECK SYSTEM & BANNING ASSAULT RIFLES SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE 2DAY ! U SHOULD B IN WH WATCHING THOSE WHO WILL #MarchForOurLives & SAY #NeverAgain @AMarch4OurLives
9427 2018-03-24 04:10:28 protecting Bump stocks?  & blocking basic background checks? Naah man. 

Even free speech has certain limitations. Ex: yelling fire in a crowded theater. 

The founding fathers probably thought people would use reasonable judgment to all amendments.
9428 2018-03-24 04:10:18 Regulating bump stocks would do little to curb gun violence. Do we NEED them... no. Heading down a slippery slope. Bump stocks are not firearms, but I urge you to remember that arms "will not be infringed"

Number of times bump stocks have been used in mass shooting: 1
9429 2018-03-24 04:10:01 Valorum Administration legalized blaster stocks. BAD IDEA. As I promised, today the Department of Imperial Justice will issue the rule banning BLASTER STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal blaster guns.
9430 2018-03-24 04:09:43 Thing is, bump stocks aren't necessary to bump fire.  Which means if you're accepting that they're bannable, you can straightforwardly apply the same logic to ban semi-automatic guns categorically.
9431 2018-03-24 04:09:26 Everybody talks big, but when they come for your guns, it will be when you're alone, with your liberal progressive neighbors cheering them on. It's bump stocks today, pistol grips tomorrow and your guns when the next liberal President is elected.
9432 2018-03-24 04:08:53 "The Obama administration didn’t ‘legalize’ bump stocks – they were already being sold,” he tweeted. “The Obama-era ATF decided in 2010 that bump stocks did not come under their regulatory authority. The Trump-era ATF said the same thing in 2017.”
9433 2018-03-24 04:08:20 A million suckers to buy c-grade stocks being pumped & dumped on them by smart fund managers who like chor managements.

No one is asking how much his portfolio stocks have fallen by - answer over 35% against the 15% cut in midcap. Several stocks down 50% in his client portfolios
9434 2018-03-24 04:07:22 Unpopular opinion;
Bumpfire stocks actually work. Which is why they are being banned under false technical reasoning.
One shot per movement of the trigger means legally semi auto. Bump firing is a pain. Bumpfire stocks make it easy to do with more control than other methods.
9435 2018-03-24 04:07:01 Yeah, Obama wanted bump stocks...you know that isn't true, but you tweet it anyway. You are a pathological POS.
You left Wash DC in advance of the kids protesting tomorrow...why did you flee like a puss instead of facing the issue like a man? Sudden relapse of bone spurs?
#Enough
9436 2018-03-24 04:06:47 The second amendment says nothing about bump stocks which are just a passive component anyway and you can make them yourself so it’s a non issue.

Despite your fears, we liberals don’t care about rescinding the second amendment. We really just want our kids to survive.
9437 2018-03-24 04:05:09 This is #FakeNews and a lie. Obama did not legalize bump stocks. @realDonaldTrump lies because he knows people will believe anything he says.

9446 2018-03-24 04:02:24 What facts is this ban based on, claiming that transgender troops are endangering the military’s effectiveness and lethality? Is it revenge because his morning temper tantrum was ignored? An effort to please his base after banning bump stocks? 
9447 2018-03-24 04:01:51 Hey dumbshit... Obama admin did not legalize bump stocks. Read!
9448 2018-03-24 04:01:21 Now you're not even making any sense. 

You think fully automatic weapons and bump stocks are fine, right? 

Kids dying is the price you're willing to pay to own a f'n gun that can shoot 100's of rounds a minute.

Again: Got it.
9449 2018-03-24 04:01:18 Honestly, you could have dozens of AR type rifles, each with bump stocks and 100 round mags a-plenty, fully loaded with tens of thousands of rounds...

And you'd do exactly fuck-all against a drone or a rocket launched from miles away.  2A is silly in this modern context.
9450 2018-03-24 04:01:01 I'm for the ban on bump stocks. However I'm anxious to see how the trump supporters will say this is great, WHILE saying that making something illegal WON'T keep the criminals from getting it.
9451 2018-03-24 04:00:57 Really? Can you point to the exec order or bill that Obama signed legalizing bump stocks?
9452 2018-03-24 04:00:47 You mean the NRA-controlled and bought republican congress approved bump stocks?  Please use facts and truth.
9453 2018-03-24 04:00:40 There is the plain fool, who does the wrong thing at all times everywhere, but there is the Wall Street fool, who thinks he must trade all the time. No man can always have adequate reasons for buying/selling stocks daily or. Play an intelligent play.
9454 2018-03-24 04:00:36 If u bought quality stocks for long run need not worry.
9455 2018-03-24 04:00:11 So whatever happened to universal background checks ? Banning bump stocks won’t make much difference if you already have one and the issue is that you shouldn’t be able to own a gun because you are mentally unstable. No one should be able to buy a gun unless they pass a bcheck.
9456 2018-03-24 04:00:05 Hahahaha bruh the Obama Administration couldn't ban bump stocks because of the GOP.

9458 2018-03-24 03:59:30 As a Vet. I believe bump stocks are corny but I don't think they should be banned. But it's never going to stop with bump stocks, the Dems submitted a bill banning all semi auto firearms. 
Anyway why don't we find out some info about that Vegas Shooting...

But still  its  was a gimmick with political value. If you were going to sacrifice  bump  stocks. Why not get something of value in return? Wall funding?
