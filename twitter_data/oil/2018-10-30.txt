4 2018-10-30 23:58:34 Uh, moving the embassy to Jerusalem only incited controversy. North Korea was never going to actually hit anything with a missile. Oil is regressive and we should be investing in renewable energy. Yay about the hostages.

18 2018-10-30 23:56:46 Price changes for Thursday. Working on new averages for this week, so the numbers may be off somewhat as I work this out: Heating/stove oils show 5/10ths down a litre. Diesel down 9/10ths. Gasoline shows a drop of 2.9 cents as oil dips lower. Canadian dollar higher against U.S $.
19 2018-10-30 23:56:43 Just say it @JustinTrudeau ; carbon taxes only apply to oil projects in Alberta.

40 2018-10-30 23:56:38 Texas will either have the nation's most interesting new senator, or they'll have that creepy snake-oil guy again and confirm the stereotype of Texans as snake oil guzzling rubes.
41 2018-10-30 23:56:28 obviously that journalist he had killed in Turkey didnt settle what he needed cause home heating oil is the highest in years...

44 2018-10-30 23:56:08 石油[タンク]︰an oil [tank]
45 2018-10-30 23:56:04 Was the taste fairly accurate? Any time we've found vegan candy corn, it's used palm oil, so that still doesn't work for us. Making our own could be just what we needed!
46 2018-10-30 23:56:00 Israel already spends much more for Gaza so imagine it would stop + the defence spendings cuts. So I know it has nothing to do with oil/gas. If they only took a step forward....
47 2018-10-30 23:55:55 halve them and roast them with red onion + bell pepper + olive oil + balsamic. Finish with a bit of maple syrup in the last few minutes. So good.
48 2018-10-30 23:55:39 Mike, you are a snake oil salesman. Nothing more.
49 2018-10-30 23:55:29 Halliburton and Dick Cheney had secret plan to start war to steal Iraq's oil
50 2018-10-30 23:55:26 That’s sort of the point. We need to focus on carbon pollution (hint CO2 is one of those carbon pollutants). Climate change is NOT a partisan issue. You can stick your head in the oil sands, but it’s still an out of control freight train.

54 2018-10-30 23:55:17 the meanest thing i've ever done to him, was one time he got out of the house and got under a car and when we got him back in, he had a bunch of oil in his fur, so we had to hold him down and actually give him a bath

66 2018-10-30 23:51:01 - any help with that? I can take a look."  He offered a kind smile and as she stepped aside for him to check it out, he fiddled with some wires and poked at some things. Stefan was the car fixer guy. Damon was lucky he knew how to change the oil in his car. 

Standing up -
67 2018-10-30 23:50:57 Changed the oil on my car and my durag came in. I love my life.
68 2018-10-30 23:50:41 We are now #1 in providing oil in Europe. NK is no longer scaring the crap out of everyone by testing missiles. ISIS almost destroyed, economy booming, we got back over 20 hostages and paid $0. We are getting back remains from NK war. EMBASSY move to Jerusalem
69 2018-10-30 23:50:41 There's more to AB than Gas/Oil...are you looking at other industries as well? Or are you just going to puppet on Gas/Oil to please those donors?
70 2018-10-30 23:50:39 With Windows 1809 withdrawn, RTX will be snake oil for a little longer.
71 2018-10-30 23:50:33 Come on,we both perfectly know that if Gaza would stop it’s attacks today and recognize Israel’s right of existance, the rule of the game would change today. They might and probably have a rich oil/gas source in the sea which Israel would gladly let them have in return for peace.
72 2018-10-30 23:50:25 Big oil money buying votes?

74 2018-10-30 23:50:13 1. people that hate jews thinks he hates jews. 2. people that hate (thats all that matters)  muslims thinks he hates muslims 3. Saudia Arabia has oil and deals buisness with Trump. 4. you too are making this easy.
75 2018-10-30 23:49:48 The bigger story is that they are agreeing to make this the hardline to appease trump in exchange for making the krg story look good and then reopen that which is no small story as it is extra 200kbd real oil after they will receive sanction to do Iranian exchange payment deals
76 2018-10-30 23:49:44 Because transporting oil by rail is so much safer than by pipeline.  Poor Canada. (Literally, poor Canada)
77 2018-10-30 23:49:36 See that is it. Canada can be off foreign oil. We produce the cleanest oil. Our carbon footprint regarding oil is neglibile. Odd how many say the enviromemt but no stance against the worst polluters. China india saudi etc.

Try soaking them in epsom salt and using a file.
81 2018-10-30 23:49:03 Veja, o Brasil era "potência" artificialmente.

88 2018-10-30 23:47:22 The type that I have (a Philips Airfryer) comes with the default being a basket with almost a mesh-like bottom. Any liquid generated/released falls into the catch-tray, so your food isn't sitting in liquid or oil. You can choose to save it (sauce?) or chuck it after cooking
89 2018-10-30 23:47:13 Yes it's too much to ask from them. Yes we have a multi-party system so it can get complicated. Basically we're pretty liberal at the moment but because we have a booming oil and gas industry there is a backlash and the conservatives are playing dirty to get in. It's unsavory.

123 2018-10-30 23:42:50 Rep. Rooney. Wondering what our "alliance" with the Saudis would look like if oil became a useless stranded asset?!
124 2018-10-30 23:42:45 The Haliburton argument may have been a bigger reason at the time, but the big one was that the war was about oil.  Which, of course, it partially was.  When someone like Mitt Romney talks about "national interests" with this stuff, he's talking about economics, as well.
125 2018-10-30 23:42:44 Time to reduce Alberta's Carbon Tax to zero and start turning off the oil pipeline taps to BC. Why are you doing nothing? Force Trudeau's hand.

133 2018-10-30 23:41:58 Why are you STILL taking oil and gas money?
134 2018-10-30 23:41:45 You know what @SarahPalinUSA suggested to power up the economy, "Drill Baby Drill"! Drill our own oil to power up Thy economy. We can defeat the Democrats that way no matter what.
135 2018-10-30 23:41:44 Argan oil based treatments is also good. Also try tresemme keratin smooth... 
136 2018-10-30 23:41:35 Just toss them in a hot pan with olive oil and salt for a couple minutes then put with normal saucey stuff of preference.

138 2018-10-30 23:41:19 Doesn't have to be complicated. Strict ketogenic diet, adequate sleep, exercise if possible. Possibly augment with coconut/MCT oil, ensure B12 levels are adequate -- that is one test worth doing. B12 deficiency *alone* (even subclinical,) not severe can cause cognitive impairment
139 2018-10-30 23:41:12 It somehow makes food delightfully crispy, without drippy oil residue (no residue, really), and without drying out food that may get dry and/or rubbery (i.e. the shrimp was perfectly cooked after 12 minutes, when I would normally only cook it for ~6 in a frying pan)
140 2018-10-30 23:41:06 Both Bushes were globalist and focused on breaking up the oil cartel. Clinton a globalist tried to patch the harms of NAFTA with loosening banks and giving loans out at a rate double the GDP. Bubble city 10 years later.

143 2018-10-30 23:40:38 also did you boil or pan fry them (lightly)? I prefer them in the pan tossed with olive oil for a couple minutes.

149 2018-10-30 23:40:10 It's a giant mystery to me. Seriously.
You can do no oil, if the food you're cooking naturally has a bit of oil. Otherwise it's suggested you add 1tsp to 1tbsp of oil (olive oil recommended). The airfryer....makes the oil an aerosol? I think? So it's like deep-frying but in air.
150 2018-10-30 23:40:05 Hempworx does not sell the correct ratio of near 1:1 in their oil. 

As stated in my thread, to treat cancer in a cat or dog (or human for that matter), you need that ratio or close. 

Most oils are 30:1 or 20:1 (rarer to find). Hempworx is no exception.
151 2018-10-30 23:39:51 Especially the offshore accounts.

Only reason that I can see for importing Saudi Oil with a big Carbon & Ethical Footprint in a tanker no less. 
There must be $ somewhere 4 shutting down only Canadian Resources.  We know the protesters are paid by tides 
Who else?

153 2018-10-30 23:39:31 She kept a huge ring on for the whole video. Why clean your face at all? A joke. Then, she pulled out coconut oil. I guess that works for some. But, she had just put on a moisturizer. My eyes hurt.
154 2018-10-30 23:39:08 Pan reheat with a little oil... 
155 2018-10-30 23:38:52 Yes, that’s exactly right, building more winds mills means drill baby drill for oil and fracking for natural gas to provide the necessary base load dependable power for when the wind isn’t blowing. Oil companies love these things.
156 2018-10-30 23:38:45 LOL. Visa/Mastercard has your info. Chase Paymentech, Global Payments, Moneris, TD to name a few, all know where you're spending money. Paypal knows too if you provided them info...

If you're concerned only about StatsCanada well, I have some oil you really need to buy.

158 2018-10-30 23:38:34 Q: Do you support Pres. Trump's stance on Saudi Arabia? 
Brenton does not support, wants U.S. to end dependence on oil.
Donnelly says he wants end arms sales to SA.
Braun does support the president's stance, believes he's made the U.S. stronger internationally.

170 2018-10-30 23:35:15 Imported from Argentina is a ship burning high-sulphur fuel oil for 7,000 miles, then served with corned beef hash? Probably not so much. Otherwise, it’s the best.
171 2018-10-30 23:35:15 Yep, for forcing me to work in the Middle East and West Africa by driving oil exploration out of the Gulf of Mexico.

187 2018-10-30 23:33:16 I used a Pinterest recipe! I just tossed them in olive oil and added Cajun seasoning and baked them at 350 tossing them every 10 minutes until they were golden
188 2018-10-30 23:33:06 On to Saudi Arabia. Brenton starts, asking why we work with regimes that murder, moves to a dependence on foreign oil, says we should drill in Alaska. We are back to HEMP! #INSen

190 2018-10-30 23:32:54 Question on Trump's support for Saudi Arabia and Brenton asks "why are we still playing footsie with regimes that murder?" Oil.
191 2018-10-30 23:32:51 do you support the President's stance on Saudi Arabia.  Brenton says when we have more oil in Alaska then in Saudi Arabia why are we dependent on a foreign power.
192 2018-10-30 23:32:48 Nice! 2019 will be fun!
193 2018-10-30 23:32:45 We cant get rid of them just yet! 

Probably going to need US or EU give a permanent security guarantee. I can't see Assad accepting a new constitution which grants local autonomy & dropping Arabization & reversing worst parts of it.
With the oil & gas fields its a viable state

196 2018-10-30 23:32:21 Tell me about it. I lived and worked in Blaenau Gwent but oil was the fundamental cause of the destruction of British industry. high exchange rates. The Tories could have done some things better but that was modest by comparison.

215 2018-10-30 23:28:45 It’s a snake oil business model.  I can understand prices in line with inflation but that’s it.

217 2018-10-30 23:27:54 And which one of those was over turning a constitutional amendment? Remind me. I seem to recall that US oil production reached an all time high at the time under @BarackObama, and how does one stop "producing water"? And most military actions since WWII have been done that way.

220 2018-10-30 23:27:32 Thought I had enough black seed oil to get through the rest of the week and I only had enough for today. 
221 2018-10-30 23:27:30 Exactly. The tweets in question were me being angry at the oil and gas industry, but I honestly think we need to wholly restructure society because society as it exists today is an ecocidal nightmare and has been for at least a millennium if not way longer.

237 2018-10-30 23:25:44 Yesss almond oil is an amazing cleanser and moisturizer. Also great for when you get dark circles
238 2018-10-30 23:25:42 The only reason oil and gas up ever followed any regulatory measures is because it was mandated. Now the president has gutted protections. Are you willing to go live in the Lancet of been polluted and that the water supply is not compromised?

263 2018-10-30 23:22:53 I mean. I agree with that. I'm not telling you to do anything differently because there is no consumer choice we can make to restructure our economy in the way required to eliminate oil, gas, and coal in the way I want.

266 2018-10-30 23:22:44 Those are springtime plagues. It’s October, so it’s cruel spirits rising up to torment the living, maybe drown them, while defending buried treasures.

271 2018-10-30 23:21:50 I’m a major Daily Provisions dissenter. Their crullers are a mouthful of oil, it’s gross. I think Du’s has a place on the list. And Dean and Deluca is a total sleeper, they make their own and serve them hot at 3pm, a far more normal time for a donut, which is, by nature,dessert.
272 2018-10-30 23:21:39 Lay your head down on me baby/ coconut oil on my grey tee/ but you know it's cool, cuz it's you

286 2018-10-30 23:19:30 There was an oil crisis in October 1973 and the UK had rationing for several months.

288 2018-10-30 23:19:21 I think I'm going to pick up some $BP $RDS.A $XOM $CVX tomorrow. Still a little sketchy with oil prices retreating and potential slowing economy.
289 2018-10-30 23:19:20 Nigga gon be tight when all they fucking shrimps stuck to the pan cuz he ain’t put no oil with his stupid ass

291 2018-10-30 23:19:08 Ummm .. if you watch the view you have a very low IQ. Joy needs CBd oil and maybe just needs to retire. She was a horrible comedian and I don't understand why she thinks he opinions are relevant. Expand your thinking Joy and eat some sweet potatoes to level out your hormones
292 2018-10-30 23:19:00 You can braise them in a shallow pan with some olive oil and a little bit of garlic, then mix them with wild rice.  They taste a little strange by themselves, though.
293 2018-10-30 23:18:43 Not siding with the Candace the profile hustler. We know a snake oil hustlin fraud when we see one. #CandaceNo
294 2018-10-30 23:18:28 . Most of the institutions established the same time with some        other countries are major players in their own right. Let’s a take look at    Petrogas and the Brazilian defence corporation and the Malaysian Petronas   oil company compare it with our own NNPC and NNDC.
295 2018-10-30 23:18:16 I’m not speaking badly about Saudi Arabia or trying to put down the Saudi ppl. Realistically, Saudi Arabia is only the 19th largest economy in the world & it only exports oil, petrochemicals, students & dollars. It’s small & has little leverage against the worlds largest economy
296 2018-10-30 23:17:41 She is a damn good Attorney. Haven't watched #2 yet, however; I'm still on the fence re Avery. He doused his Cat in oil and set him on fire, watched the poor thing burn. Something very amiss
297 2018-10-30 23:17:40 My oil change took forever so they gave me a discount and it came tomonlt $30.62 yayy
298 2018-10-30 23:17:37 Put everything in the basket with some chopped garlic and a tsp of oil, put in the Airfryer at 400F for 8 minutes. Stir, cook 4 minutes more. Dump into a big mixing bowl, add sweet and sour sauce, stir, eat! 
Highly recommended. Like deep-fried peppers and shrimp.
299 2018-10-30 23:17:21 It’s not the point of how much oil we have, it’s making sure we can’t use our own oil to recover from the war

301 2018-10-30 23:16:55 SINCE WHEN IS THE DEFAULT DRESSING SOMETHING DIARY? What happen to oil and vinegar?
302 2018-10-30 23:16:53 I don't know what meth is like but CBD Oil has helped me so much! Have you been thinking about trying CBD Oil?
303 2018-10-30 23:16:52  My mum is on the same boat. She was given 6mo 2yrs ago. She’s strong & in full remission. Still gotta do the chemo thing. 
Swears the CBD oil cured her.
304 2018-10-30 23:16:33 I’m going to take my snake oil somewhere else. Hard to believe there is a gullible voter left to listen.

313 2018-10-30 23:14:37 makes you wonder who is driving it!
1. War machine? who is driving that? it's a self perpetuating global cancer.
2. Resources, oil etc, who is driving that?  destructive earth destroying disease, 
Get to the top of the tree and you will find the reason for the US abomination.

318 2018-10-30 23:14:18 Lavender essential oil was used to treat PTSD in veteran hospitals in Europe in WW1. It is a calmative and always helps me sleep. Frankincense cured my ganglion.
319 2018-10-30 23:14:15 That's a very awesome thing! Have you been wanting to try CBD Oil
320 2018-10-30 23:14:10 Plenty of hate on every single source of media there is. Glass houses?
Real issue is what to do. 
Driving it underground into the shadows doesnt eradicate it or make it any easier to ferret out.

330 2018-10-30 23:12:00 You bought a pipeline that will increase tanker traffic in key habitat of the endangered SRKW.  You are allowing oil sands emissions to *increase* to 100Mt per year when we have to cut our emissions by 45-50% by 2030.
331 2018-10-30 23:11:34 R u talking about allo pastors selling #oil or market women selling oil
332 2018-10-30 23:11:13 Oh shit true, I should be recommending pure CBD if possible, specifically just the oil that you take drops of. You don't need any THC. It's just pricey right now to take on a daily basis until prices go down (if they do). My friend was looking in to it for medical reasons himself
333 2018-10-30 23:11:10 I know the feeling! Anxiety is hard to deal with. Have you found a Brand of CBD Oil that you are interested in trying?
334 2018-10-30 23:11:09 There is some debate over the amount of money that Libya had for such purposes. Remember that Libya had recently benefited from incredibly high oil prices, and that they produce very high grade oil. Several billion dollars could have hugely influenced Africa if utilized correctly

Scientists need to make a facility accessible to the public that showcases the effects of climate change. They could experience what a heatwave 12 years from now will feel like in your region, replete with dirt, soot, smog, and ash.
End oil!

348 2018-10-30 23:09:40 So the oil gets delivered and the lads forget to ask for the tank to be bled. Ugh another night sleeping in an igloo. #adultproblems

355 2018-10-30 23:08:47 whenever a woman refers to herself as a “mama” I automatically assume that she is 1.) antivax and 2.) deeply entrenched in an essential oil pyramid scheme
356 2018-10-30 23:08:47 My father (@ aged 45) had a heart attack in 1969. B4  attack he had not eaten corn oil or any omega 6 oil. Lots of butter, dripping, deep-fried beef, fatty cuts of lamb, eggs, bacon. Young men were having heart attacks & dying young in the 60s & 70s. That msg has been lost.

370 2018-10-30 23:06:48 Sure there’s an easy answer. The “most peaceful” don’t have oil to be invaded for.  Sweden and Germany are accepting refugees from war we brought. Not sure why you are getting angry, let’s try to stay civil please.
371 2018-10-30 23:06:41 Can I check your oil? 
372 2018-10-30 23:06:38 Launching our new Premium Extra virgin olive oil soon, keep watching, very exciting.

375 2018-10-30 23:06:17 I thought I was OK with a 1991 Honda that gets 30+mpg, what are you driving from '74 with such good mileage a Volkswagen? I can't afford a EV & they burn more oil than a ICE in production. Yes, you get a break!
376 2018-10-30 23:06:05 All I know is Tea Tree Oil really is amazing stuff.

381 2018-10-30 23:05:20 They also don't like to talk about the consequences of their policies. Sure everyone wants a cleaner environment, lets shut down the oil sands, its a nice thought, until we realize that we will just import more Saudi oil, and lower our GDP among other things.

Go figure.
394 2018-10-30 23:03:45 No I try to clip them when he's distracted either with toys or peanut butter, but no one will even let us take him in because he is so huge they are scared of him even though he's nice as hell. He just doesn't like nail clippings for some reason. CBD oil is suggested but eh.
395 2018-10-30 23:03:42 "Something all three have given me is an appreciation for one of the pillars of our success as a nation: the rule of law."

Im sorry, but where exactly is that nation with the rule of law? It certainly aint USA. Theyre taking @elonmusk down to protect their corrupt oil money.
396 2018-10-30 23:03:34 I was recently floored & ecstatic when I heard my Pain Dr. say his entire perspective on MMJ had been completely changed and that he was now even investing in a Canadian CBD oil company. Only took him 20 years to catch up but I’m happy he finally did.
397 2018-10-30 23:03:23 Has he ever queued for cooking oil. Strive must wait a bit. Unless he is benefitting more in this chaos.
398 2018-10-30 23:03:05 A woman had breast cancer (from eating CRAP..like OIL) and climbed a mountain

399 2018-10-30 23:02:59 I live in colorado.there are a lot of jobs at stake. Environmental extremists and the message of shut down all exploration and extraction of oil and gas has to be countered, all the ppl making a living directly or indirectly in this state have their voices heard by this money.
400 2018-10-30 23:02:48 chicken breasts, pork tenderloins, berries, avocados, surprisingly their shrimp cocktail (idk!!), olive oil, spices, cheeses, and their store brand otc medications are really well priced. sometimes they have kombucha

HAPPY BIRTHDAY
402 2018-10-30 23:02:39 Getting my car serviced at the dealer and these sales ppl are swarming around my table like vultures. 

Oil changes these days are downright dangerous.
403 2018-10-30 23:02:36 So he doesn't care if that pushes some nut to kill people? Why do people who made money off of oil then get enough money to turn into an environmentalist for guilt and then think because they are rich they get to tell millions lies & what to do?
404 2018-10-30 23:02:33 Came for an oil change and they’re washing my car for free after I’ve already paid for it to get washed this week :( smh if I would’ve known

410 2018-10-30 23:01:53 It's called redistricting, fear among Hispanics of registering (saw this firsthand as a VDR) and the money Cruz gets from Big Oil etc. Throw in some some voter suppression and there u have it
411 2018-10-30 23:01:34 I don’t like the stink weed weeping into my personal space in public and at home. Oil and pill form are ok with me.
412 2018-10-30 23:01:28 Pierre takes my car to get an oil change on the day he changes his and washes it that day. If not for him, my car would have dirt from 2016 still on it.
413 2018-10-30 23:01:10 I’ve been waiting here forever while my car gets an oil change 
414 2018-10-30 23:01:07 Not that the POTUS has really any control over oil prices - its a global commodity BUT those toadies, sycophants and shills over at .@FoxNews *claimed* it was all the black man's fault back then. Now? It's all the Orange Cheetos fault right? Nah we've got crickets.
415 2018-10-30 23:00:39 Anyone good oil tycoon investors!
Please give me money!
416 2018-10-30 23:00:37 No fracking in Colorado, Jared. Stop turning our state into a playground for the oil and gas industry. Global climate change is gonna kill us all. We need real leadership, not centrist waffling.

What's NOT going up are people's paychecks.. DEMS want safe borders and LOW taxes. What taxes have YOU EVER paid??
423 2018-10-30 23:00:25 I'd love to try this facial oil 
424 2018-10-30 23:00:17 Castor oil my friend was centimeters dilated n lost her mucus plug took castor oil (mix it in something, only A LITTLE) n she had her son the same night oct 23 due nov 4

世間は南瓜祭。

個人的には、
初冠雪とか西高東低の
気圧配置の方がずっと
コワく感じていたり。

今朝は、その寒がりが
我慢をしていた空調を。
勿論、噴き出してくる
風は暖かい。

猫の顔色を見つつ
床暖か、Oil heater か、
空調かで迷った挙句

ピッ！

ー そんな、神無月末日。
426 2018-10-30 22:59:59 My back is bruised from my shots soo my dad actually changed my oil for me guess I need to get more shots so he can fix my car
427 2018-10-30 22:59:53 I’m being a good adult and getting an oil change 
428 2018-10-30 22:59:44 @ZfepoRLYR8TEd2z 
おめラジラでございます
429 2018-10-30 22:59:43 No honey, we get that "winter skin" too. And those of us with thyroid disease have that shit year round. I have to oil up every time I take a shower. I definitely feel your pain!  
430 2018-10-30 22:59:37 We're just going to import that oil and gas form someone else's vibrant sector.  Net gain to the planet: nothing.  Net loss to Taranaki: shit loads.
431 2018-10-30 22:59:26 Hello world has anyone tried CBD oil products besides me...no side effects associated with prescription drugs
432 2018-10-30 22:59:02 Lol can't wait.
433 2018-10-30 22:58:44 No problem! Might be worthwhile to finish it off with some mink oil or other product that would be used to waterproof leather shoes to help keep the moisture out of the leather.
434 2018-10-30 22:58:36 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
435 2018-10-30 22:58:35 Good question. Is this the seminal moment Americans have been praying for for over 30 yrs? 
It took Trump to breath life into smoldering issues nobody else wanted to touch. 
For this, all Americans should applaud him, like him or not.
436 2018-10-30 22:58:30 Boiled egg if i have, sesame oil, fish sauce, kimchi if i have and siracha
437 2018-10-30 22:58:25 @ChannonRose If you’re stilling having trouble producing, take fish oil! I don’t know if you do or if anyone has told you but it really works!!
438 2018-10-30 22:58:17 Wow. The Oil Can I know never booked anything that far out.
439 2018-10-30 22:58:10 WTH... I have this cuticle oil and used it for the first time rn and it smells like stale French fries lmao ew
440 2018-10-30 22:58:06 Change oil tune up
441 2018-10-30 22:58:02 core inflation gonna be below target again and oil prices coming back down. economy weak plus tariffs. only upside impulse may be coming from weakening euro but with the powerless demand side i still don‘t see that ecb needs to hurry.
442 2018-10-30 22:57:58 Oil change on my truck...my truck is beautiful and I'm due for an oil change so.....
443 2018-10-30 22:57:27 حياك الله يا "المصطفق" كانت لنا أيام ... والله زمااااان .
444 2018-10-30 22:56:19 let me rub some oil on dat booty though 
445 2018-10-30 22:56:07 The love machine cleanses with a little faith
Like a car wash spitting out soap and oil
There ain't never been a cleaner girl in the whole wide world
Turning in your body's, psyche, dial a perfume that you like,
The love machine will put it on you right.
~Prince
446 2018-10-30 22:56:06 So fuckin        and sexy as always @lolaknight201 especially with the oil
447 2018-10-30 22:56:01 Wrong!!!  If he cared so much about the environment he would not import oil from Saudi, Qatar and would use environmentally produced Canadian oil. That would show that he actually cares and listens.
448 2018-10-30 22:55:59 Only if the price of a barrel of oil stays up!
449 2018-10-30 22:55:44 Daddy freeze, wetin be that oil for the paper nah?  Eh resemble boole oil ohh, abi nah roasted yam own?
450 2018-10-30 22:54:58 If we imprisoned El Chapo somewhere near the Canadian oil fields, could we trick the cartels into digging an underground crude pipeline for us?
451 2018-10-30 22:54:53 More like they are in shipping/ oil rigs in the red sea
452 2018-10-30 22:54:43 Coconut oil saved my life  I’m fucking with it forever
453 2018-10-30 22:54:06 grapeseed oil dari purivera.
454 2018-10-30 22:53:57 Seriously, tar sands is in common usage and was invented by the oil industry.  It's fine.  Thanks.
455 2018-10-30 22:53:51 Miss to attend your talk again sir especially on the topic of oil & gas.
456 2018-10-30 22:53:49 If Iran could sell oil the price would fall but soudi price also
457 2018-10-30 22:53:32 The CX left a Texas-sized glob of oil on my breakfast plate.

How have they not been sued?
458 2018-10-30 22:53:32 資料擬きをつくって遊ぼうかなって
459 2018-10-30 22:53:18 Yay! Some honesty (no surprise after how many ACCC enquirers into fuel prices?) Two words, folks: Refiner. Margin. (Oh and benchmarking with MOGAS 95, which crude oil, ‘one off’ fuel standards...)
460 2018-10-30 22:53:14 We bought a lot of land. trump, dirty EPA & big oil want to poke holes all around. He Poached Bears Ear & Didn't ask the Native Americans. They say it's theirs. Murkowski, got millions in Alaska, this heritage preservation site & the only territory of endangered Red Bear.

462 2018-10-30 22:53:05 What’s wrong with sandpaper? Salt and pepper with some olive oil cooked at medium heat for 8 minutes, it’s not that bad.
463 2018-10-30 22:53:01 you might get a preview here tomorrow.

464 2018-10-30 22:52:54 Well, if we agree that loss happens prior to detectable symptoms, how will MCT oil regrow the lost neurons? 

Or is this position based on the idea that 30% of fully functional EC neurons will be able to replicate the prior functions of the normal EC neuron amount?
465 2018-10-30 22:52:27 If they don't go bust by then lol
466 2018-10-30 22:52:23 Saka urikuti iwewe when you were desperate for cooking oil you also tried engine oil?

468 2018-10-30 22:51:54 Thatcher took us into the Gulf war for oil, destroyed industry throughout the UK that has caused the problems we no have. She took milk from nursery children while the HOL were have a 3 course luxury meal free for attendance of their nursery, where they take nap time after dinner
469 2018-10-30 22:51:50 Bukan serum, ni ialah essential oil (eo) utk promote fungsi sistem endokrin bdn yg teratur &sihat. Sistem endokrin bdn ni kawalatur penghasilan hormon. So bila hormon teratur, emosi ok, isu hormonal acne pun boleh dikawal. Eo ni ada sage, geranium & spearmint yg bagus utk females
470 2018-10-30 22:51:46 Oh hey dad, when you come to "visit"me in the MENTAL hospital because I need something particular, like baby oil and vaseline and I say PINK PINK PINK, guess you thought I meant the green one that I'm allergic to? Oh hey, dad maybe NEXT time check the plastic bag for air holes.
471 2018-10-30 22:51:39 Big oil and hedge funds. Lawsuit abuse easily done it seems.
472 2018-10-30 22:51:31 My car service on my car is 170 to change the air filter and my oil change  I AM CRYING
473 2018-10-30 22:51:25 Soaring fuel prices hitting Aussie family budgets. Noosa too has been ripped off by the oil companies. Shell = $1.69 Puma ( 20 kms away ) $1.55.
474 2018-10-30 22:51:17 《オリーブ油の豆知識》

エキストラバージンオリーブオイルとはオリーブの果実を搾ってろ過しただけのバージンオイルです。
475 2018-10-30 22:51:14 Well as long as it is only about ELECTIC cars and not ELECT-R-IC :D 
Utterly BS if you see that 300B in Oil Subsidies are paid every year for toxic air.
476 2018-10-30 22:51:12 I'll prob try this or at least cbd oil, but my anxious ass brain will prob go into overdrive so I will need Xanax on hand in case I have a self induced panic attack
477 2018-10-30 22:51:12 I love your constructive criticism, I won’t even lie. Coming back to your original point,  the white man is here on our continent mining gold, klinker, oil & gas. You should know that the white man cant keep his hands out of the cookie jar.
478 2018-10-30 22:51:03 I will send it to you tomorrow ,no problem, simple ,logical accurate, no snake oil;-)
479 2018-10-30 22:51:03 Yes prob Heid. Hope it's another Beatles :)

481 2018-10-30 22:50:43 My doctor told me a man needs protein everyday, he said eat some eggs, one of the biggest myths is that eggs are bad for you the yellow yolk, I eat them everyday cooked in olive oil and have for a long time and my cholesterol and blood pressure are perfect, 124/ 74
482 2018-10-30 22:50:30 Drink honey, lemon and ginger in hot water. Also gargle salt water. Rub Vicks on your nose to unblock it and Olbas oil steam is also good. Being sick doesn't sound good. If it's constant then I would go see GP. I hope you're improving? Xx I didn't have flu jab or any antibiotics.
483 2018-10-30 22:50:28 He’s gone in the spirit and probably high on anointing oil for him to say that
484 2018-10-30 22:50:17 Never seen so much olive oil, exfoliating gloves and red skin than in my groupchat tonight
485 2018-10-30 22:49:50 勝利を！摑み取れぇー！！
486 2018-10-30 22:49:44 I was just at a gas station putting more oil in my car and a mechanic yelled “Hell yeah girl you take care of that car. I’m proud of you for being a responsible adult!” and that’s the kind of cat calling this world needs tbh
487 2018-10-30 22:49:30 Today for the first time ever in my life, I learned how to make "yellow rice with corn" by substituting the oil with butter. Believe it or not, the rice has a very good taste to it when made with butter.
488 2018-10-30 22:49:21 do u meAN ARGAN OIL?
489 2018-10-30 22:49:21 She looks like an oil painting. So beautiful.

496 2018-10-30 22:48:56 や、マジで私が物として欲しかっただけだから態々金を払って刷る価値は特にないです
497 2018-10-30 22:48:54 Blackbird Energy Inc. and Pipestone Oil Corp....
498 2018-10-30 22:48:49 Send me a picture of your hair lol. Use coconut oil for your eye brows . I use a q-tip to apply it on my brows . I do it my lashes too cause I’m trying to grow them .
499 2018-10-30 22:48:38 LMAO Oh man. I used oil once upon a time and enjoyed it and I honestly enjoy pastel but chalk pastel is too loose for me. I gotta work this employee discount while I have it LOL
500 2018-10-30 22:48:32 Really, I'm not ok with most of these fabrics either. They are poly based - plastics and oil have a huge and devastating effect on the environment and the very animals we are trying to save from extinction. Can't we appreciate the fur real or not on the animal, alive & well?
501 2018-10-30 22:48:30 Economy is tanking company’s are leaving killed the oil sector and now a carbon tax that more damage to come. The liberals love to us creative accounting when it comes to the job numbers.
502 2018-10-30 22:48:28 So now you can predict how long a resection will last based on world oil prices? Interesting
503 2018-10-30 22:48:23 Rubbing my feet during my break feels so fucking gooddd
504 2018-10-30 22:48:13 @neontaster please make sure these peanut butters don’t use xylitol as their sweetener. It is very dangerous for dogs. Safety wise, natural - peanuts, oil, salt only or self grind is probably the safest.
505 2018-10-30 22:47:58 Yes, the orange turd has been lifting restrictions on public lands to sell to the highest bidders. Oil, coal and god knows what else will be mined.  there are some lawsuits going on right now to try to stop.
506 2018-10-30 22:47:55 一応ね、、やってますよっていうアレ、、、、、刷らなくていいです
507 2018-10-30 22:47:38 sure can. it’s not gonna harm them or anything. i give my dog coconut oil all the fucking time. it stops her itching, she doesn’t smell, repels fleas, yeah it’s fire. she’s super soft
508 2018-10-30 22:47:24 Hillary Robthem Clinton, Americas greatest Shakedown Artist, Congenital lier, Flam-Flam artist and Snake Oil sales woman, has just stated for the thousandth time she wants to become President, and if Bill, her husband helps her, she is going to give him a present of a box Cigars!
509 2018-10-30 22:47:13 Tea tree oil
510 2018-10-30 22:47:11 there's something universal about snake oil. 
sells anywhere anytime.
511 2018-10-30 22:47:07 Para el chupa cabra , sierra oil , cuñados Gerald .q mas ..
512 2018-10-30 22:47:00 if being ripped is a concern, have you seen our slice for allocated to any distribution of 'benefits' as you re calling them?  Its about a fingernail full, the rest goes to military and corporate welfare; Walmart subsidizing underpaid workers, Oil & Gas, etc  - its a footnote
513 2018-10-30 22:46:48 my nan just gave me cbd oil and was like “for your headaches :)” i’m dying i don’t think she realises that it’s literally thc djkdkddj
514 2018-10-30 22:46:44 the aristocracy used to control food access (energy) of we peasants 

cheap surplus oil changed all that

but with oil in decline, we may have to subject ourselves to landowners again to get food
515 2018-10-30 22:46:36 Boiling oil?
516 2018-10-30 22:46:36 Cholesterol? My foot.. I’m consuming Butter, grass fed meat, free range eggs, hard cheese, avocado, coconut oil everyday.. I’m still full of energy and strength.. I do not believe any of their bull crap..,
517 2018-10-30 22:46:31 As long as the value of US currency is set by the Petrol Dollar, the fiduciary "benefit" of reliance on foreign and domestic oil production for the value of the dollar will prevent any effective move to cleaner/"green" energy.  Right, @GOP @DNC @GreenPartyUS @LPNational?
518 2018-10-30 22:46:31 Keep some good fats in your diet. Almonds, walnuts, olive oil, and avocado.
519 2018-10-30 22:46:07 코코로님에게 감히 불만이 있는가
520 2018-10-30 22:45:57 That's why I said whenever that happens. I'm amazed the car companies are barely lifting a finger. Do they expect the US tax payer to front all their costs? I didn't think big oil would fail like this. Kicking, screaming, and in total denial.
521 2018-10-30 22:45:52 The Poppy seems to be used to justify the use of the army in wars funded by business people as those in the oil industry. In N. Ireland the poppy has been used as a remembrance symbol for  Loyalist paramilitaries who killed innocent Catholics and who later died. Is free will...
522 2018-10-30 22:45:29 HAPPY HALLOWEEN
523 2018-10-30 22:45:23 how do people eat fried foods on a daily basis ? I always feel like I'm drinking oil straight from the bottle
524 2018-10-30 22:45:17 Got off work to a clean car and an oil change thanks to my baby
525 2018-10-30 22:45:08 You still looking for CBD Oil?

533 2018-10-30 22:44:16 my hair is that cellophane stuff they used to put in easter baskets. no matter how much oil i've been slathering it in. damn dry weather.
534 2018-10-30 22:44:00 Best part of goth money is the 9/11 oil war shit as an aesthetic, its like what arizonas and n64s meant to ancient peoples
535 2018-10-30 22:43:48 Midnight Oil é muito bom vsf
536 2018-10-30 22:43:39 Tips: 
-Use face masks that work with your skin type
-Keep your lips moisturized 
-Try to wear less makeup 
-Drink lots of water 
-put oil on your lashes (coconut isn't the best because if it gets into your eyes you won't be able to see)
537 2018-10-30 22:43:37 imagine having to look at oil paintings of your parents instead of cave art depictions
538 2018-10-30 22:43:32 Waiting with oil in case we need to fry it here
539 2018-10-30 22:43:29 @WakeupNeo1 are you still looking for CBD Oil?
540 2018-10-30 22:43:22 Hear me out...combine the best of both...Surefire Essential Oil Consultants...just saying....it's like printing money...
541 2018-10-30 22:43:07 Oil Outlook: Bearish Momentum Abates Amid Failure to Test August-Low: A series of failed attempts to test the August-low ($64.45) may generate a near-term rebound in crude oil prices as the bearish momentum starts to abate.
542 2018-10-30 22:43:02 Just imagine taking palm oil to Santorini
543 2018-10-30 22:43:00 What oil exactly.
Olive or Kube, oilve dey cost small the Kube one too eh the one from my village is cheaper
The red oil too when it stains your dress we'll notice easily.

Aside all that, to answer your Q.
There is nothing wrong.

Or, are you referring to crude oil?
544 2018-10-30 22:42:52 Snake oil salesmen dressed up as an Instagram celeb. Just a total culmination of this shitty era wrapped up in one person
545 2018-10-30 22:42:43 In Colorado, we have citizens against oil & gas. We will win. #PeopleFirst #peopleOverProfit
546 2018-10-30 22:42:36 I put too much oil in my hair and now my hair won’t dry. FML
547 2018-10-30 22:42:13 I'll give you that one.
To sway from this slightly, any gain will only be temporary any way.
Peak oil demand will hit between 2025 and 2030.
Tar oil will be pretty much worthless after that.
Even 2030 won't allow us time to recoup the money wasted buying it and building new.
548 2018-10-30 22:42:06 Where can I get a synthetic oil change for the low
549 2018-10-30 22:41:29 Yes reading up on them now the who's ass do i kick refers to the oil spill in the gulf...the punish your enemies refers to obama saying for the spanish to vote if they want to punish their enemy...i will try and find more info...would you like me to post trumps so you can also
550 2018-10-30 22:41:16 I normally just use like
Sunflower oil!

I thought I'd try this instead and THIS WAS A MISTAKE

Butter tends to burn before the popcorn pops on this really cruddy hotplate stove we have
551 2018-10-30 22:41:06 $10bn is the same pre and post devaluation.  Borrow USD pay back USD from crude oil in USD or are you referring to domestic debts?
552 2018-10-30 22:40:46 Val Serena: present honey mustard pretzels, peanut crunch, garlic & caramel nut brownies. A useful red & caramel, rosemary olive oil
553 2018-10-30 22:40:43 Ever had a girl say: oh the easy bake is only yours baby, only to find out the oven has been baking pigs in a blanket since it started dripping oil?
Sucks huh?
554 2018-10-30 22:40:37 I gave my sick bf a spoonful of seal oil before I left the house and now I can't smell anything but seal oil
555 2018-10-30 22:40:30 Well @J_amesp has been saying No Deal & no 2nd vote likeliest outcome for 2 years. How will Scotland survive the total chaos though? Have you listened to #TheFall podcast? I seriously doubt Westminster will let its oil/gas/water/cannonfodder vote itself free after #Brexit
556 2018-10-30 22:40:28 Ima try castor oil cause the other option aint working 
557 2018-10-30 22:40:22 Sautée-ing because I’m impatient and I like olive oil

559 2018-10-30 22:40:05 迷うなあサラダ油なの？ごま油なの？どっちが好きなの？
560 2018-10-30 22:39:59 I thought that might be the case. I infused the oil with orange zest, but didn't think it would matter. The scent has dissipated and the resulting cake is lovely! Thank you, Stella!
561 2018-10-30 22:39:51 If we really cared we would stop importing oil from regimes such as Saudi, Qatar and others and start using ethically produced Canadian oil.
562 2018-10-30 22:39:48 I’m afraid once the oil runs out, Saudi Arabia (or any other successor State) will fall into insignificance in the eyes of the US
563 2018-10-30 22:39:41 @72Hallam I hope that you really give it to them you shouldn't be sent to prison for helping people out they did the same thing up here .a lovely bloke at Crescent Head that used to give away cannabis oil he helped us during my dad's cancer he is now in jail .and burnt it all
564 2018-10-30 22:39:33 this oil sounds fab, please count me in

4 large eggs , room temperature

567 2018-10-30 22:39:17 Uh uh go to the nearest cliff and jump if you are serious..but I hope u choose the oil
568 2018-10-30 22:39:14 most movie popcorn is made with rapeseed or soy oil instead of like actual butter, weird
569 2018-10-30 22:39:12 Tea tree oil from Lush and skincare in general  doesn't really matter
570 2018-10-30 22:39:08 I think that's the problem.. I'm not waxing it anymore... just oil. The oil isn't making it stiff
571 2018-10-30 22:38:58 If you overcook it, it’s rank, go a little more al dente, oh add coconut oil to the water instead of olive oil 
572 2018-10-30 22:38:53 bread with olive oil is so good
or maybe i’m just hungry
573 2018-10-30 22:38:52 Socialism should take the predatory aspect out of capitalism - also why do 1 percent control who gets what? Capitalism doesn’t work without limits - just look at the environment - oil profiteering is killing us #stopglobalwarming
574 2018-10-30 22:38:48 So, krill oil supplement and diet high in oily fish is the way to go?
575 2018-10-30 22:38:46 @Walmart  Sad to hear that nearly $300 was taken out of my car at a local WM during an oil change and all I get is “oh well.” NEVER going to trust this company again.

577 2018-10-30 22:38:40 Off topic. Can u take on why America has high heating oil prices early in season when we are biggest producer of oil now and it is causing Ct and other states to go broke buying heating oil
578 2018-10-30 22:38:25 Combined with the current value of the AUD. But that relates to the average price because the weekly or whatever cycle that the oil companies inflict is artificial bullshit.

581 2018-10-30 22:38:02 My 11 year old daughter asked me what “HANGRY” means, I asked where did you hear that baby? Her friend who is a boy, said he was “HANGRY”!!!!!! 
So please send bail money . 
I have to end a bloodline!!!
582 2018-10-30 22:38:01 Yes he needs to read up on the US Supreme Court's breaking up of the Standard Oil Co. and the subsequent looser "Seven Sisters" arrangement... He should take on something more achievable like curing cancer or heart disease.

583 2018-10-30 22:37:59 And?  Their age has nothing to do with the veracity. N.B this was before oil, gas, greater industrialisation, renewables, the technology industry, and even video games, so I do want to know what the audit would be now
584 2018-10-30 22:37:49 I don’t like it either. Thing is, god forbid your house catches fire, who are you going to call? 
What if I’m a corporation & want to drill for oil in nat’l parks? 
When you cook your food do you want to just hope for the best? 
My argument is against free market absolutism.
585 2018-10-30 22:37:43 the squeaky obnoxious wheel gets the oil 
586 2018-10-30 22:37:29 Venezuela wants to go to war with the US? I surely hope they don’t because that would be absolutely embarrassing. But shit I’ll take that oil any day. #makegaspricesloweragain

So you want to be a leader, you gather a force behind you, then abandon them?
What kind of damn leadership is that?

593 2018-10-30 22:36:52 Think after midterms we get a relief bounce in oil
594 2018-10-30 22:36:51 MI-1. I know you’re not big on the yard sign predictor theory, but there is disproportionate representation of the Democrat in traditionally red areas. Also, my part of the district is pissed about the oil pipeline in Mackinaw.

596 2018-10-30 22:36:46 Sounds like we have plenty of pipelines then, eh Kenney?

It is never enough for the oil industry though.
597 2018-10-30 22:36:30 Lmao sorry WRONG.we have more oil in Alaska and Gulf of Mexico then anyone.we choose to take other oil till everyone is bone dry then we will use ours..lmao sad Canadians don’t even know what’s going on
598 2018-10-30 22:36:28 something a little different a 5ft shoe box with double doors finished with 2 coats of tung oil, and 3 coats of antique pine
599 2018-10-30 22:36:14 Hi diff topic entirely. Can u tell me why Ct residents are paying 2.72 to 3.10 a gallon for heating oil.  Can u work in something that really matters.   Before this yr it was 1.40-1.60 a gallon. Shameful
600 2018-10-30 22:36:03 "climate change"? LOL... 30 months ago, this mook would have been screaming "Dems don't care about stopping the TPP/oil pipeline/drone strikes/Goldman Sachs/Boko Haram!" or whatever the emoprog boogeyman was back then... It's *always* something with them.
601 2018-10-30 22:35:54 So, if the dollar pops, then the Euro drops and oil drops?  Is that how that dance goes?
602 2018-10-30 22:35:29 Epsom salts. Lavender oil or eucalyptus oil. Bubbles! Or if you’re ballin go to lush 
603 2018-10-30 22:35:20 I love it, but I also have oily skin. I mix it with manuka honey, apple cider vinegar and a couple drops of tea tree oil.

607 2018-10-30 22:34:40 Here's a funny thing I learned about adulthood.

Ultimately, nobody cares what you do or don't do. Don't vote. Don't pay your bills. Don't change the oil in your car. Nobody cares now or later when you get evicted or can't afford to replace the engine. But you might.
608 2018-10-30 22:34:35 pringles is owned by kellog's and in 2016 amnesty international filed a report on them for forcing 8 to 14 year old kids, not getting paid, getting extorted, threatened and abused to farm palm oil

611 2018-10-30 22:34:04 I just needed oil and spark plugs and some seat covers
612 2018-10-30 22:33:55 But how do you make environmentalism conducive with a capitalist society? I don’t see the oil giants dying to invest in solar.
613 2018-10-30 22:33:51 $60 on oil...just the oilthe best of the best for the best lmao
614 2018-10-30 22:33:51 awalnya jumat 2 minggu yg lalu tuh milk cleanserku yg viva abis, terus cuma ada baby oil. jadi aku ngebersiin muka make baby oil trs gacocok eh keluar semua dan breakoutnya sampe skrg kaa

619 2018-10-30 22:33:13 Lol. I think it's just Bowen that offers this course up till now even though they might stop soon.
Funny enough I don see em cv before. Nice setup nd all.
I don't think I knew him at all sha. Maybe dem Baba Dee, T.boy or Odus wld.  Cc @femodus
620 2018-10-30 22:33:13 I agree 100% on the oil but that is far more than should occur under normal conditions. If oil was passing through one or both turbines regularly that section would eventually fail due to thermal shock stress. Black smoke = carbon burn off , white / blue = oil burn off 
621 2018-10-30 22:33:06 oh i am definitely sick my throat feels like i drank hot oil lol

623 2018-10-30 22:32:40 Fact check on Line 9 claim: Line 9 was approved during Conservative era, but it started flowing in Dec 2015, with Libs recently elected to power (Kenney & Harper out of cabinet).
And FWIW, Line 9 is primarily not an export pipeline (brings US & Cdn oil into Canada).
624 2018-10-30 22:32:38 Essential oils are the best for this!! Chamomile/tea tree/ lavender/ lemon/ peppermint are the best! I find Chamomile to be the best to use on the skin, the others you may need to use a carrier oil like Almond, rub gently into your scalp and leave 5 mins

634 2018-10-30 22:30:56 Albertans share the risks for the pipelines that ship the same product through the province too. The oil is produced in the NE part of the province and has to be shipped from Fort Mac to Edmonton then to the provincial boundary.
635 2018-10-30 22:30:54 No. What’s wrong is that we helped screw up those countries by supporting drug cartels, dictators, and corruption. Why don’t we take some of the money that we give to Isrrael and Afghanistan and help out neighbors. Oh that’s right. No oil there
636 2018-10-30 22:30:49 #НетМонополии Now I and my family will completely ignore Rossneft's company, because of the monopoly of the oil business. My family does not have enough medicine for father's treatment and even for simple footwear for us.
637 2018-10-30 22:30:48 there's literally nothing factual or moral about this statement... the oil sands, pipelines, missed targets, endless spending in third world countries, carbon taxes, all of it proves there's no threat, and it's all about money

639 2018-10-30 22:30:28 you can use coconut oil as well.  As long as the oil is pure, any of them are fine.
I use oil on my skin but I'm old and post menopausal and drying up like a prune.
It does feel very nice though
640 2018-10-30 22:30:22 Ya’ll can bash him all you want, but he’s made a fuck-ton of money conning sheep out of their coin... Mad props to him, living tax-free selling snake oil...
641 2018-10-30 22:30:14 oh no, what happened?   i used Vitamin E oil on mine, i just poke a hole in a capsule & squeeze it out
642 2018-10-30 22:29:57 Why anybody has anything to do with this poisonous wretched society is beyond me. They can stick their blood soaked oil money up their

647 2018-10-30 22:29:30 Test rode my Brompton for the first time in months after an oil and a clean. How did I ever ride it. 
648 2018-10-30 22:29:20 Okay so there are needs and want. So I don't know if I can ask dis here but I need possible questions an oil company can ask as General aptitude test.
So onto the want. I want/need  a guys white shirt. I just love wearing one but nobody wants to give me
649 2018-10-30 22:29:10 They don’t want Crimea to be part of Russia. Especially Donbass, where they have coal, probably gas and oil. They definitely need Ukraine for some pipeline! When it comes to natural sources the EU are just as bad as US. But they are supposed to be part of the Energy Charter
650 2018-10-30 22:29:09 OMG i just tried this butter with avocado and MCT oil and i now have a 210 calorie cold brew. Up from 0.
651 2018-10-30 22:29:07 Featured Employee:  Emilio Castellon learned to do oil changes and worked on some Glendale Police Department vehicles. Our GYA youth workers have awesome opportunities to gain experience at various City sites!
652 2018-10-30 22:29:06 I would NEVER say yes to a decadent and depraved offer to do a few hours of work for a shit-ton of blood-soaked oil money, because that would be morally reprehensible, but also: my dms are open, in the spirit of free speech, transparency, and open debate.
653 2018-10-30 22:29:05 I prayed for the oil to be poured out on my life.  I ain’t understand that the olives get crushed to produce oil.  The grapes get stepped on to make new wine... oh what a glorious time to be alive 
654 2018-10-30 22:29:00 If they can't prove it, you can't be prosecuted for it. Way to cover your tracks buddy.  BTW, can you recommend any investments? I gotta whole lotta oil money to invest pardner.
655 2018-10-30 22:28:58 I just can’t seem oil & water mixing at any level.

662 2018-10-30 22:27:41 My Welsh grandad grew up in a cottage in the Welsh mountains with just a wood fire and oil lamps. As the eldest he had to walk across the valley each morning to collect drinking water for the family.

Now I carry around a supercomputer in my pocket.

669 2018-10-30 22:26:43 Is this the same coinage they use to send soldiers to their death and injury to help the US grab another countries oil & then hold the Invictus Games for those who thought that they were doing something for the UK rather than it being used for the Royals career?
670 2018-10-30 22:26:42 Exactly how do you expect to pay for all this free stuff if you keep killing jobs? 
The direct and indirect impact is enormous when you're killing tens of thousands of direct jobs with wages averaging $100,000 +,  majority only requiring high school education

674 2018-10-30 22:26:12 Joe should take CBD oil. Start with 300ml and increase to 750 over time. Bye bye cancer.....for good.
675 2018-10-30 22:26:09 Yes, and we're going to try to do most of our heating with wood this year. Heating oil and electric have gone up alot.

683 2018-10-30 22:25:09 This smear of Bob Mueller by Trump supporters don't have to have substance. It's enough to get followers to repeat it. Rumors like this are a like a drop of oil on a pond. It'll spread to cover surface of pond and be only a few molecules deep.
684 2018-10-30 22:24:55 honestly i think the only thing i can do is get a chop :’(( but i’ll use plenty of oil and masks after to keep it all healthy
685 2018-10-30 22:24:49 Today I found out that you can put too much oil in your car.
686 2018-10-30 22:24:44 Was just in a *hipster cafe* and the liberals were discussing how fictitious narratives are demonstrably skewing public discourse toward the ends of autocratic snake oil salesmen and their sycophant click bait underlings.
687 2018-10-30 22:24:39 Did u tell your friend about CBD oil yet?
688 2018-10-30 22:24:37 he was saying that if a barrel is going to be taxed then the oil is going to be sold for more to compensate for the tax, so therefore gas prices will go up to compensate for that as well it was just an estimate, fuck
689 2018-10-30 22:24:26 In answer to #Paul_Macartney's shirt....no we never will, because we are many many cultures combines in one giant bowl called United States, some are like oil and water, no matter how much you try they won't mix.
690 2018-10-30 22:24:26 This assumes that dilbit trades at a consistant rate of discount to WTI. It does not. Beyond that, the $4M/day lacks context.
If Canada wants to up its gross from oil exports it needs to upgrade that stuff into synthetic.

701 2018-10-30 22:23:40 For resisters out there: please do Western New York State a huge favor by spreading the news that @MitranoForNY23 is running a close race with incumbent Republican Tom Reed. He takes money from oil and NRA. Must vote him out! #resist #bluewave Please RT to help if you can.
702 2018-10-30 22:23:36 Glow Oil? But that's coconut oil.. 
703 2018-10-30 22:23:24 I hope you get jalapeño oil in your eyes again :)
704 2018-10-30 22:23:22 I can’t even make my meal, I need sausages, shrimp and cooking oil
705 2018-10-30 22:23:15 Beardy stuff.. why isn't my moustache staying put.. it keeps falling down.. I can't sleep with oil on it.
Should I condition it more ?
706 2018-10-30 22:23:13 They are called plus +Cbd oil
707 2018-10-30 22:23:06 Anyway I kind of want to try oil pastel again cause I did once and enjoyed it but also oil is scary
708 2018-10-30 22:22:55 good. the ugly things are no match for palm oil.
709 2018-10-30 22:22:55 OMG don't get me started on that clown! I actually blocked him a while ago cuz I got tired of his BS & never ending insults about everything Oilers. Has to make me wonder if he really owns the BB company cuz who'd behave that way while representing a biz in Edm where the Oil are
710 2018-10-30 22:22:53 It takes a lot of beard oil and a little bit of love
711 2018-10-30 22:22:52 Funny until you realize how horrible it looks when a nation stops buying an Arabic nation’s oil it reeks of islamaphobia, this is Th SAME AS THE MISLIM BAN BY TRUMP EXCEPT ITS SAYING “we don’t want your Arabic oil because you’re a Muslim country” 
712 2018-10-30 22:22:39 Okay boss, please check your dm
713 2018-10-30 22:22:38 Vamoh a oil lo!
714 2018-10-30 22:22:31 Childish Gambino on the playlist while burning the midnight oil.

I am addicted to working at this time of the night, it's just so much better.
715 2018-10-30 22:22:28 Also all of that fracked oil that they’re shipping out of state. (I didn’t even read the article, I’m just feeling very critical right now)
716 2018-10-30 22:21:57 The bandage is off

I repeat JET’S BANDAGE IS OFF! And I only made her cry twice. I had to bathe her in olive oil so I consider this a win. Plus don’t think she called the police or seriously meant it when she threatened to join the circus. 

Now brb gotta de-oil the kitten
717 2018-10-30 22:21:56 Let have a look at our oil , there is enough in west Australia and bass straight to make us self reliant they send our oil to Singapore to be refined then send it back at
world prices so they can screw us what happened to our refiners
718 2018-10-30 22:21:42 oil and wax on canvas, 20” x 24”;  thanks to the person who said I could use her photo.  (Looking for the name)

723 2018-10-30 22:21:08 wow im so embarrassed I never hear what people be saying. I’m here to get an oil change and he asks if I’m here for the drive thru oil change and I thought I heard “is this the first time” so I answer, “no, second” and this mans has the most confused look on his face LOL FUCK
724 2018-10-30 22:20:30 Olive oil on my face feels soooo good
725 2018-10-30 22:20:22 Let me think, then it’s your birthday tomorrow too  go as a 70s pimp, put a lot of oil sheen in ya beard
726 2018-10-30 22:20:19 My younger sister married into oil money and is gestating her third human. Also she works at a daycare now and that’s way tougher and more rewarding than my fake city job.
727 2018-10-30 22:20:09 I ordered it and received the cbc oil and it really works but I can't afford the program for health and sleep. Maybe just one. Just really love the health trial.

731 2018-10-30 22:19:49 Is CBD oil good or should I just stick to meth
732 2018-10-30 22:19:46 While valves can actually be used as rough baffles, they still need to be cooled to condense impinging oil molecules. If not, you will still experience creep from the oil and some load from backstreaming, especially if using something like DC-704 rather than 705 or Santovac.
733 2018-10-30 22:19:45 Lesotho: HOE ... Hash Oil Exporter  #DOPEC
734 2018-10-30 22:19:32 Thank you so much for sharing your PT Halloween bag! We are so happy you guys got the chance to color one! We are super pleased to hear that you are loving your Zombie Blood oil!
735 2018-10-30 22:19:09 Preheat oven to 375. Toss the seeds with salt, olive oil, cumin, smoked paprika, then in the trash. Open a box of “fun size” snickers. Eat them while noting that it’s no fun opening 20 of those little packages.
736 2018-10-30 22:19:07 The LS engine is actually slimmer in width. My engine is like the successor to the 2jz it’s big as shit. He custom cut his oil pan and some other shit to get the transmission n whatnot in.
737 2018-10-30 22:19:00 lol my fucking trousers smell like Olbas Oil
738 2018-10-30 22:18:57 君を揚げたいな…君を炒めたいな…君に僕を絡めたいな…僕は君のそんな存在になりたい。いや、既になってるだろう?
739 2018-10-30 22:18:52 You're nothing but Big Oil's bitch if you vote no on I-1631.
740 2018-10-30 22:18:38 Some really strict vegans don’t eat anything that has even come in contact with animal products such as fries being fried in the same oil as chicken nuggets for example, but McDonalds has a separate fryer for potatoes, and more vegan friendly restaurants normally do too.
741 2018-10-30 22:18:35 "You knew him when" he was just a snake oil salesman. 
Now he is conning in the trillions. Your feelings will soon be shared by many, many others, when he sinks the nation in red ink.
742 2018-10-30 22:17:57 Luckily we get fresh ones from South Australia here.. I fry them in coconut oil.. taste nice..
743 2018-10-30 22:17:31 basically tracks oil prices
744 2018-10-30 22:17:31 yeah he’s dodgy, like a …snake oil… salesman
745 2018-10-30 22:17:24 Nate, I support your tiny corner of the Liberal backbench, but your government spent 5 billion of our tax dollars on an oil pipeline and committed to no better emissions targets than Harper. Trudeau needs to be better on this.
746 2018-10-30 22:17:15 Tea trea oil, just make sure to clean it everyday
747 2018-10-30 22:17:09 Things that don't mix: oil and water, coffee and anxiety
748 2018-10-30 22:17:02 Instead of sending military lawyers and doctors to the border, the Pentagon need to deploy combat eng oil beers to place LANDMINES, because a wall will never work. Think Korea DMZ = landmines 65 years.
749 2018-10-30 22:16:59 @davidlebovitz Trying your recipe for marinated feta..can one use that infused olive oil in other recipes? Not sure if the feta leaves any kind of residue into the oil. Advice? Thanks!
750 2018-10-30 22:16:52 食パンさん、おは未来ちゃです！
751 2018-10-30 22:16:41 Chinese Vice President lands in Israel, becoming the highest ranking Chinese visitor in 20 years, promising economic gifts and an oil refinery at Haifa! So much for the absolutely lunatic conspiracy theories about any sinister "Israeli" ploy being in the works against gwadar
752 2018-10-30 22:16:27 d fight isn't perfect but at least it's being fought.
U keep talking about dollar. Is there any other source of forex other than crude?. There was a slump in oil revenue without a decrease in govt responsibilities, surely there'd be problems. At a point $1 =N500. It is better now
753 2018-10-30 22:16:26 Fried quickly with chilli oil - then it's edible!
754 2018-10-30 22:16:21 I wanna go to the Oil game tonight, should’ve brought my own vehicle fml.
755 2018-10-30 22:16:13 No not really, but it is a clear marker of how desperate our unionist supporters have become, once it was we were too poor, too wee and too stupid. We couldn't use the £, our deficit would be too high and ALL the oil is running out, now they resort to Bruce wisnae Scottish lol
756 2018-10-30 22:16:12 I have my own Hair product "No soap" consists of an orange juice base, that I make, and pure olive oil has worked wonders on this old skin.
Glad you found a good product. It is a long road for long hair.
757 2018-10-30 22:16:09 But, unlike this Administration, no one will be immune, and don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
758 2018-10-30 22:16:07 Errm Chi my daughter, let u and ur jewelry casket go and ask aunty Rita if she has finished frying her plantain, i need the oil hot.
759 2018-10-30 22:16:06 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
760 2018-10-30 22:15:58 When you have an oil leak you don't continue to pour in oil. You may even go to the garage and get it fixed, but they comes a time to change cars. We can patch the market economy as much as we can but there will still dangerous be instability
761 2018-10-30 22:15:41 After how many miles is it a good time to get an oil change ?
762 2018-10-30 22:15:39 I knew it was some when i seen a nigga getting a “hot oil treatment” at the shop i was like  we failing as a species.... niggas focused on the wrong shit
763 2018-10-30 22:15:35 Ha!!!
I saw a stripper at the Wild Goose do that once.
She filed for Worker's Comp.
OSHA ordered the Strip Club to post a sign to notify the Dancers to no longer wear Baby Oil while on the Stage.
764 2018-10-30 22:15:23 I use coconut oil or butter in my coffee just before bed.. I sleep like a baby..
765 2018-10-30 22:15:20 Unfortunately name calling doesnt make it so! doTERRA has no nazis in just pure and therapeutic oil! Sounds like you need some #balance, #serenity or #peace in your life!
766 2018-10-30 22:15:07 Subway napkins absorb the excess oil on your face pretty well. This is a good thing to know
767 2018-10-30 22:14:52 Salmon fillet stewed with cheddar cheese. Toast baguette with olive oil and sliced leeks. Serve immediately.

769 2018-10-30 22:14:33 Keep an eye on Carnarvon Petroleum (CVN) - some serious investment going through in the last 3 days at $0.35. Last time this happened we saw the price go from $0.10 to $0.20. Oil facing down but CVN good for a speculation on news - target $0.70.

771 2018-10-30 22:14:22 Many #data analogies today at #MFGSUMMIT18. Data is "currency" "a bride" "like oil." Our fave: “I would consider data a raw material. Just having a lot of data is like having a factory full of raw materials and no plan to turn it into anything.” Ryan @teemforwork #industry40
772 2018-10-30 22:14:08 Palm oil!
773 2018-10-30 22:14:06 I took a baguette, toasted it with olive oil. Little bit of cream cheese with avocado and tomato... its really good and I think I may have turned into a california hipster.. what is happening..
774 2018-10-30 22:14:02 Robyn Gordon Centory: Flowers are white-to-grey and urn-shaped. Has marijuana-like effects if crushed and snorted. Fruit an oil painting.
775 2018-10-30 22:13:41 To have engineers is one thing,to have the necessary facilities and adequate funding is another...the crude oil that is freely given to us by God,what have we accomplished with it?refining to both commercial and domestic use is a mountainous task.
776 2018-10-30 22:13:41 Hmm, Alberta leading the country in growth and post oil price drop recovery. Yeah, I’m OK
777 2018-10-30 22:13:24 The Venezuela  finance model? Don’t remember democrats suggesting the U.S. basing our economy solely on oil.  Now fair taxes and and immigration policies? Yes that we are for, along with investment in renewable energy and health care that is affordable and accessible for all.

781 2018-10-30 22:12:46 Oil first, corn second.
782 2018-10-30 22:12:45 Yes we also saw some oil rape seed flowering on the edge of a broccoli field that was being harvested on one of the local estates. We did a 8 mile circular from St Mos to Anster then inland through 2 Estates via Abercrombie church ruin. Lovely walk, We've never done it before.

785 2018-10-30 22:12:11 it's extremely unlikely that they'd be forced at gunpoint to give up their assets like how we ended chattel slavery so while such a bailout would be massively unpopular it would also probably be the only way all that oil and gas stays locked in the ground short of miracle tech
786 2018-10-30 22:12:09 From oil and gas... Production: Permian Basin... additional $1 billion... he wants to pay teachers more... 1,000 on additional methods to help secure the border too... Local news: A.) 3 more Ex South Texas leaders get prison... B.)
787 2018-10-30 22:12:01 We will soon be offering samples of our cbd oil! Comment yes and I will let you know when available.
788 2018-10-30 22:11:50 if someone bring cooking oil to copper and I’ll feed ya 
789 2018-10-30 22:11:42 We just talked about this at a staff meeting. A 'normal' news day cycle was once 3-5 stories. And now...a good day is 8-10. Yay for acupuncture, cbd oil, and an office blanket.

791 2018-10-30 22:11:24 A new battery and an oil change you hurting me red
792 2018-10-30 22:11:23 I know! I have some lovely olive oils. Tradition in local Italian American community to dip fresh bread in olive oil.
793 2018-10-30 22:11:12 oh right, I use veg oil #AtoZQuiz
794 2018-10-30 22:10:25 That really wouldn't be sufficient. We'd also need to shoot oil, gas, and coal executives to make it really stick. Hypothetically, of course. I'm not actually suggesting any crimes here on twitter dot com.
795 2018-10-30 22:10:24 I need an oil change. Gotta learn how to do it myself.
796 2018-10-30 22:10:22 Britain created countries, so they can benefit from it's resources with no thought on how the people within those territories, on those lands will be affected, as long as they get their oil. And you want to tell me not to come to your country? Our country. Abegi, UK la ma ku si!
797 2018-10-30 22:10:11 Don’t spill oil in the garage kids
798 2018-10-30 22:10:09 expected a more nuanced argument from you. Forex cannot be an indicator of economic health. Yes the constant fall is scary but please factor in the oil prices; almost all currencies are down. Can INC promise to rein in the exchange rate? even Dr Singh will not support your tweet

802 2018-10-30 22:09:44 Rumours? NIGERIANS are tired of rumours concerning Oil wells. The government has to be on top of sensitive matters especially common wealth assets. Clarification is a matter of importance and urgency in my opinion.
803 2018-10-30 22:09:31 An oil drop? 
804 2018-10-30 22:09:30 You should carry cbd oil around you , really helps
805 2018-10-30 22:09:12 Absolutely! Make sure it’s a whole food plant based diet with no to low oil and no refined sugar or flours. #wfpb
806 2018-10-30 22:08:59 おはようございます(*^^*)

808 2018-10-30 22:08:33 >eating hydrogenated oil unironically
Don't do this to yourself
809 2018-10-30 22:08:17 How did I ever live without an oil diffuser
810 2018-10-30 22:08:07 It’s not all oil price driven. Oil peaked at $145 a barrel in June 2008. The dollar was $0.96 and petrol was circa $1.65. Compare that to today of $70/barrel and $0.70 and it’s back at $1.65. Also likely there is much more pain to come in 2019!
811 2018-10-30 22:08:01 Indigenous rights? (Eye roll) 
They are served very well by oil and gas industry, better than any Liberal gov't ever has.
Stop *signaling* and let us pass already.

813 2018-10-30 22:07:36 Ok...6 of those were just nasty. The crocodile dung as a contraceptive . The snake oil and bread were the two I could believe.
814 2018-10-30 22:07:36 Since I have been using the hemp oil shampoo and conditioner by @dr_organic my hair has become healthier & thicker! Also, I've been using the hemp oil lotion & my skins have become more smooth. Thank you. I'm glad I found this product. Can't wait to discover more.
815 2018-10-30 22:07:33 i remember that @StLouisBlues jersey.
816 2018-10-30 22:07:24 Is it true that Oil Companies get an 80% rebate? If so, not sure how this policy will help at all.

819 2018-10-30 22:07:07 There are also specific exacerbatory episodes, that say more about the duplicitousness of Evo & Chavez as powerful individuals: Evo's opportunistic usage of Buen Vivir to win votes from his fellow indigenous Aymara people; and Chavez's proposed oil refinery in Dominica.

821 2018-10-30 22:07:01 I really do not understand healthcare is like you taking your car to get an oil change  or a tuneup or a new transmission you're not  entitled to  anything pay the man for the work he's doing.  Doctors go to school for a long time just like mechanics.  they deserve to get paid
822 2018-10-30 22:06:59 But they can't eat this, it probably contains palm oil.
823 2018-10-30 22:06:57 butter too... and oil. beside from transporter malfunction, there's no reason why those two things should be on the outside of the container. 

what's more, they shouldn't be on the outside of the pepper grinder, rendering it utterly fucking useless.
824 2018-10-30 22:06:56 Good idea ! I like a chat.
825 2018-10-30 22:06:50 We should not be burning natural gas and we should be bringing our oil production to 0 a quickly as possible. Coal, oil, and gas should all be gotten rid of immediately. I'm not really willing to bend on this. All three of them are killing the planet and everyone on it.
826 2018-10-30 22:06:33 Thank you mom for getting me a bottle of lavender oil ,and rose hydrosol . 
827 2018-10-30 22:06:17 Also a coconut oil “leave in treatment” that is pretty awesome too.

829 2018-10-30 22:06:13 roast them! it's super easy: rinse off excess pumpkin,  toss in vegetable oil, put in medium over for 10? min (okay, I always ask my mom, awkward at 42) - when golden brown, take out, toss with salt and enjoy crunchy goodness! I love them so much.
830 2018-10-30 22:06:06 Seems so. The commentary is appalling in it's lack of knowledge on the subject.  
Point of diminishing return has been reached and the more we spend on education the less people know.
831 2018-10-30 22:06:02 So what? This is a gradual shift 2018- 2030. By 2030 many countries are banning fossil driven cars. We need to cut ff use 50%, not 100%. We will just put major disincentives in place to use oil, just like heavy taxes on booze and cigarettes. Then keep ratcheting them up.

834 2018-10-30 22:05:25 I passed my driving test today and now I feel like I never want to drive again... 

I had to change to an unfamiliar vehicle partway through (the other started leaking oil) so that was stressful. But now I'm at home chilling with my cat and doing homework so it's all good, haha.
835 2018-10-30 22:05:21 Still depend on the money source if the government did not need it’s citizen pocket at all (oil exporting countries is a good example) then those government can throw the citizen off the balcony to stay alive...
836 2018-10-30 22:05:20 I hate the fact that this chestnut and argan oil body spray reminds me of Tai.... I can’t even smell good in peace. Fuck.
837 2018-10-30 22:05:13 I’ve never understood the appeal of margarine. I mean, if you want butter, use butter. If you want oil, there are plenty of choices, depending on what you’re preparing.
838 2018-10-30 22:05:12 Any daughter doing this against her dad is simply disloyal. Whether your dad is a nut or not he's still your dad and do we really believe the news on this? Just claiming he said these things. Maybe he is crazy. I don't know. Not enough info. But his daughter is a turd.
839 2018-10-30 22:05:04 England is siphoning Scottish oil thanks to Dewar
840 2018-10-30 22:05:03 GUYS I WENT TO MCDONALDS FOR LUNCH AND GOT HOT NUGGETS AND FRIES MADE IN FRESH OIL TODAY IS GOING WELL
841 2018-10-30 22:04:54 Lol. They blew millions on two experiments for the oil companies that I know of. Now they’rejust rusting piles of steel. Total failures.
842 2018-10-30 22:04:54 That's terrible...with no pipelines and oil being sold at a huge discount, it will only get worse. Before we know it, the whole country will be in recession like AB
843 2018-10-30 22:04:29 Yet humans are stuck on earth, worrying about borders and oil. It's a shame our atmosphere blinds us from the universe during the day. Its a beautiful thing that too many humans ignore.
844 2018-10-30 22:04:00 bobsled, skeleton and luge can use those vacant, empty oil pipelines.. it's perfect!
845 2018-10-30 22:03:58 Lord  I use pure coconut oil after a wash and then super gro grease! Restores like crazy
846 2018-10-30 22:03:32 natural gas however is a byproduct of oil production, and it's hard to replace oil for some things, so we want to be sensible and use that natural gas we'll collect anyways (otherwise it just hits air) while discouraging excess production (fracking) and credit for carbon capture.
847 2018-10-30 22:03:08 I'm a man, but can't work on vehicles worth shit. 

I've worked with computers, fixed small appliances, done complex construction projects, and done a lot of other hands-on work, but can't tell the difference between a vehicle's oil and transmission fluid....

...twice...
848 2018-10-30 22:03:08 Brown ground beef with olive oil, when beef is 1/2 done add onions and bell peppers and cook until onions are translucent.

Add all ingredients to slow cooker and stir, cook on low for 4-6 hours.

Optional - 1 diced Serrano pepper, 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper for more heat.
849 2018-10-30 22:03:07 It was the wrong plan anyways. It’s the wrong place to load oil. Those are treacherous waters.
850 2018-10-30 22:03:02 Only a fool will be blind to the fact this is another avenue for wasting money similar to the oil subsidy. There is ample room for corruption, unmeasurable impact of education on the children and clearly unsustainable.
851 2018-10-30 22:02:51 Just buy an Electric vehicle... not only do you avoid the carbon tax, you dont need to buy gas or pay for oil changes. And EVs are much faster and safer cars.
852 2018-10-30 22:02:33 From end WW2 until early 1970’s both major parties had exposed policy of full employment. Then oil shock, Reagan & Thatcher came with new economic paradigm devised by people who wanted to destroy the state & redirect wealth to the rich. They succeeded & we pay the price #auspol
853 2018-10-30 22:02:25 that has also been proven mostly false :/ Beto voted against a bill that was (basically trying to stop another bill) pushing for no taxation on oil in order to improve transportation and energy, for the whole US
854 2018-10-30 22:02:15 Water. Cranberry extract capsules. Oil of oregano.
855 2018-10-30 22:02:12 Also fun fact my car doesn’t need an oil change until 10,000 miles woop
856 2018-10-30 22:02:07 has griitty...lean oil but mine lost last nite will be angry pieman
857 2018-10-30 22:02:06 wait. The government doesn't get that money? From oil on its land? Which is being raped by big oil companies? This is why I'm so bitter.
858 2018-10-30 22:01:52 the planet is 4.5 billion years old and we have had destroyed it in the last 200 years. since 1970s 60% of wild animals gone but lets keep on fracking, drilling oil in the Arctic, poisoning oceans with plastic etc etc .....
859 2018-10-30 22:01:28 Sure I grant all that could happen. And if so, it would be a tragedy. Nonetheless, the American presence is not motivated by a desire to steal oil or imperiously "occupy" parts of Syria. But we do know that is exactly Erdogan's motivation.
860 2018-10-30 22:00:46 This guy really looks good on paper.

876 2018-10-30 21:59:03 You could always buy a new or used electric vehicle. Not only would you not pay the carbon tax, but you would no longer have to pay for gas or oil changes and with a carbon tax, govts can afford to give large EV incentive rebates to its citizens to make EVs much more affordable
877 2018-10-30 21:58:28 How are you applying the osmo oil?
878 2018-10-30 21:58:24 Here's an idea - let's not extract oil at all.

884 2018-10-30 21:58:08 Corn is not healthy, it has hardly any nutritional value, it’s highest value being adding fiber to your diet and it has carbohydrates. The reason that it’s popular is because it is so versatile, everything from oil to sugar is made with corn nowadays
885 2018-10-30 21:57:59 Ok...I get you. I do like the running machines. My aim is to run further and faster so one day I can run all around our village. People will see me and think....how on earth is she doing  that !!

887 2018-10-30 21:57:48 Honey and lemon to drink and Olbas oil on your pillow. Broth / soups too and a super hot shower are great. Hope you feel better soon! 
888 2018-10-30 21:57:38 Why tf would you think it was ok to put oil all over your body just to take pics in the house..
889 2018-10-30 21:57:33 Aye, it's oil ones I'm looking at. Most with 24 hour mechanical timers have comments complaining that the timer constantly ticks. The ones with digital timers seem to only have countdown to off / on rather than on/off settings throughout the day.

895 2018-10-30 21:56:40 And remember: The 15 largest ships in the world exhaust the same amount of pollutants as 750 million cars. Yeah sure, but #Crypto will ruin the environment. Try hitting on heavy oil for a change. PS: Can @elonmusk please establish a Tesla branch which takes care of ships?

897 2018-10-30 21:56:37 Not to mention oil could show this story, about a Democrat in Texas who has actually been convicted of tampering with the vote, both sides have problems.
898 2018-10-30 21:56:35 Plant based dairy will save the environment from climate change. Everyone knows grain/oil seed farmers care for Mother Earth way more than dairy farmers.  Nothing died on a grain farm today.  #grainfarmerscare

905 2018-10-30 21:55:56 Footage drilled for oil rigs is a key indicator used for non-residential fixed investment (structures). One of the reasons we’ve seen an increase in business investment (part of GDP) these last two quarters.
906 2018-10-30 21:55:52 Blunt while I get this oil change
907 2018-10-30 21:55:45 Sure, squeaky wheels get the oil - but everybody hates them.
908 2018-10-30 21:55:31 I’m fixing to drop some tender loin in 1” of oil. Picture to follow
909 2018-10-30 21:55:23 “The earnings from oil from 2010 to 2014 were the highest recorded in the history of the country. This is a period when the price of oil per barrel sold from $100 to $114." -Prof Yemi Osinbajo, VP

911 2018-10-30 21:55:08 Shiiiiiid, my first horse died, that group by the oil field popped out on me. We both got handled. RIP Midnight
912 2018-10-30 21:54:53 Read the story. A fourteen year oil leak may be a sign of broken regulations.
913 2018-10-30 21:54:48 Imagine spending 2 hours sweeping an mopping floor for someone to spill oil on it an not clean it up
914 2018-10-30 21:54:19 lol I know you told me already i gauge my exercise and fat burn on my intended calorie intake . So 4 pints of Guinness and a chicken fried rice = 30 min run and 3o min weights shadow boxing our another aerobic exercise. So my training works round my intended fat intake . lol
915 2018-10-30 21:53:55 I’ll never forget Sheryl-Ann is a “classically trained oil painter” because she doesn’t fail to mention it every 5 minutes oh my lawwwd @SkinWarsShow
916 2018-10-30 21:53:45 The oil collapse of 2016 was a warning sign to all oil producing states to diversify away from oil. Alberta failed to listen and take action. So the the next time oil collapses, I not going to feel even a little bit sad. Only yourselves to blame

918 2018-10-30 21:53:39 U really think the US is into prevent Turkish land grabs? Watch how Brunson’s release will spur the Turks to continue their attacks and watch how the US will betray the Kurds again just like in 1975-as for the oil share deal,ur right- but we can’t go east of the Euphrates river
919 2018-10-30 21:53:29 Lavender EO stops bug bites from itching. I mix a few drops with fractionated coconut oil and put it on all exposed areas. Smells great + Effective. (Be careful using EOs if you're going to be direct sunlight for extended periods of time).

921 2018-10-30 21:52:54 I just realized that this might sound like I was conflicting with what you said but it wasn't meant to be lmao. I was definitely agreeing and used that Smith quote because most people just think ONLY the car/fuel thing. Food is different because it's both the fuel AND the oil.
922 2018-10-30 21:52:48 The guy changing my oil called me mam to my face!? I love being a woman.
923 2018-10-30 21:52:32 With oil down on a strong up day, WCS spreads not narrowing (why would they? problem remains) and sentiment not to get better until Keystone, I fully expect them to keep dropping. This is even better than I hoped for. Retail painfully wrong. ATH at C$0.70 by Q2 would be my guess.
924 2018-10-30 21:52:26 Dude Beto didn’t even vote for 10$ tax per barrel of oil. Cruz accused him of it in a debate and Beto denied it lol people never do their research
925 2018-10-30 21:52:12 The above study stops short of extrapolating into the tax take based on businesses that rely largely on Oil for products.
Even so, in that year Scotland was allocated just 0.9Bn in "Oil revenues", rUK about £11Bn, clearly a demographic rather than geographic distribution.
926 2018-10-30 21:52:06 The awakening causes the fearful and the loving to seperate as oil and water.

931 2018-10-30 21:51:23 Oil - it's the only thing you guys are capable of producing (and that's with significant Western assistance). You guys are like a considerably more violent/sexist version of The Beverly Hillbillies.
932 2018-10-30 21:51:20 You have to be an idiot to take lots of fat from butter and animal fat.  Fish, nuts, avocado and olive oil is more than enough as a source of fats, animal fat has to be limited.

937 2018-10-30 21:50:19 He is ridiculous.  There is nothing free about pollution.  Pollution is a huge cost to every person's health.  The problem is there needs to be a global wide effort to
reduce #GHGemissions.  This will never happen, since too many countries continue
to depend on oil.
938 2018-10-30 21:49:46 There are some good oil filled radiators - friends had them in a really cold house. They have a thermostat and timers. They aren't cheap though.

947 2018-10-30 21:48:41 Athabasca Oil Corp is likely to realize losses of $200M+ between Q3, Q4, but good luck. Maybe Nuttall will be right and they get bought out. Need deep pockets to wither the storm.

960 2018-10-30 21:46:30 The PYD has already made an agreement with the Syrian Govt., regarding oil. Most of the oil revenue goes to the Govt.  I dont know when the US will leave, perhaps when the Turks stop threatening to invade, and mean it, and when they withdraw from Idlib and Aleppo.

962 2018-10-30 21:45:53 The 2015 @Hyundai Sonata Limited T2.0 has 21 fasteners that have to be removed to take off the splash pan under the engine to access the oil filter and drain plug.  There are no access holes in the pan.  The car must have been designed by someone who's never worked on a car.

971 2018-10-30 21:44:49 Put a couple of drops of almond oil in your liquid lipstick so it doesn’t dry out your lips! Life changing 
972 2018-10-30 21:44:44 Boy look here I hate oil and gas 2. That’s one class I can’t stand
973 2018-10-30 21:44:32 @atiku  is only an entrepreneur if oil bunkering and gun running are businesses.
974 2018-10-30 21:44:30 Going to get ur oil changed is the most cringeist time as a female like btfu damn
975 2018-10-30 21:43:58 Scared the snot out of @LyriumBiotic with a burst of laughter.

Local garage is offering "pumpkin spice oil changes"
976 2018-10-30 21:43:54 @steveinburnaby I suggest you study fossil fuels & realize tar is a by product of oil, not the other way around old man
977 2018-10-30 21:43:54 Here are my recs for #waelex

1631: A future for our planet; big oil spent $27M opposing this 
1634: Fight back against corp influence on taxes 
1639: Sensible gun policy 
940: Safe communities 
WA Supreme Ct: Vote Gonzalez! (1/2)
978 2018-10-30 21:43:52 You'll be opposed 2 massive bungs + subsidies 2 nuclear power then? Nope? And huge tax write-offs for oil and gas industry? Nope? A wide range of tax benefits + policy support for the fracking industry? Nope? More than a billion to 'buy' DUP votes? Nope? Bit partial aren't u?
979 2018-10-30 21:43:46 You never had a crazy night on the olive oil?
980 2018-10-30 21:43:43 We know the truth don't we. The structure of the country makes it so difficult for any gov to utilize those huge resources we claim the states have. What happens when price of crude oil goes to the 2016 levels?
981 2018-10-30 21:43:39 Recently had a major Crohn's flare-up lasted 10 days. Horrible pain. Friend returned from Colorado with some THC vape oil and told me to use as much as I needed. It cut my opiate use more than 1/3. I hated it to give it back but he has Crohn's too and probably will need it.
982 2018-10-30 21:43:37 The bacteria in your life can't be cured by detol. You need better anointing oil.

พี่คงไม่ได้รู้สึกอะไรกับหนูจริงๆ
แต่หนูกลับมีมากขึ้นเรื่อยๆ
หนูควรทำยังไงดีคะพี่เฟม
หนูอยากกลับไปหาพี่
แต่มันผิดมากเลย
หนูต้อวเข้มแข็งขนาดไหน
เวลาก็ผ่านมานานแล้ว
แต่ทำไมหนูยังไม่หายสักที
พี่เฟมคะ...
พี่ไม่ได้รู้สึกอะไรกับหนูจริงๆหรอคะ
พี่รักหนูบ้างมั้ยคะ
984 2018-10-30 21:43:26 Well those hypersonics certainly can’t secure Russia oil shipment to China which happened to roam in Indian Ocean.
While carrier strike group can float anywhere they wanted (new one are about to have a laser turret to wreck your hypersonics (nothing dodge the speed of light)).
985 2018-10-30 21:43:17 When the hot oil is popping anyhow
986 2018-10-30 21:43:10 I'm in with a chance of winning a great prize with Carotino, the healthier cooking oil!
987 2018-10-30 21:43:09 I also observed someone trying to add oil through the dipstick hole.....I was like 9 years old and I knew better...
988 2018-10-30 21:43:00 I wouldn’t drink the olive oil if I were you
989 2018-10-30 21:42:37 柘榴さんおはありです！
990 2018-10-30 21:42:30 Its not a simple task to transition away from an oil dominated economy when over 80% of the population live in urban areas that are not self sufficent especially in food production

995 2018-10-30 21:41:47 The Venezuelan revolution has had to deal with a complicated task of improving the living conditions of a predominately urban population while relying on revenue created through oil and a smaller sector in mining.
996 2018-10-30 21:41:37 So moral of the story, there are extreme safety regulations for oil. Let those boys work how they are at the prices they’re at. Anytime you add regulations, every single one of your tax dollars increase. Just keep that in mind. I get the elway comparison with him being GOP 4/5
997 2018-10-30 21:41:29 宏々さんおは未来ちゃありです！
998 2018-10-30 21:41:23 Damn rights it would! They will win one for you!! Go oil..
999 2018-10-30 21:41:23 mine is the same way! i do that shampoo all over then the conditioner all over (just 1-2 pumps) then when my hair is just damp but not dripping i add about four drops of that oil focusing more on the middle and ends of my hair (no roots)
1000 2018-10-30 21:41:18 And Big Oil CEOs rejoiced! #ontariofatcats becoming obese.
1001 2018-10-30 21:41:17 Strawberries taste like tomatoes

Strawberries don't taste good sautéed with garlic and olive oil
1002 2018-10-30 21:41:04 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.
1003 2018-10-30 21:41:03 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1004 2018-10-30 21:41:03 Trudeau Gov’t has no plan 4 the serious repercussions of the coming climate change effects on Cdns survival-Trudeau is sidelining conversations, as other countries build Green energy & jobs therein,Trudeau’s still pushing his globally dangerous oil pipeline-He’s sick in $ b4 ppl
1005 2018-10-30 21:40:54 They should send them to work on an oil rig for a year. Both of them.
1006 2018-10-30 21:40:45 I am going to rub vitamin E oil in to it in Sat. Remind me please?
1007 2018-10-30 21:40:43 Come to get an oil change... oh you need this.this.that.this.... BITCH JUST CHANGE MY SHIT 
1008 2018-10-30 21:40:26 I had an old banger that used to go that slowly , burnt oil as well !!!
1009 2018-10-30 21:40:26 Oil change, new oil filter, clean and vacuum the interior, put it through a block, and I did it!
1010 2018-10-30 21:40:24 coconut oil is great for your dog.
1011 2018-10-30 21:40:22 So glad when companies make it glaringly obvious who they want boycotting them!

Among some of the healthier ingredients (duplicates not by accident): liquid sugar, sugar, peanut oil, dried cane syrup, soy lecithin, peanut oil, carrageenan, corn maltodextrin. 
1012 2018-10-30 21:40:09 smart cats know that when DT tweets, Jesus dreams about being a #Democrat
1013 2018-10-30 21:40:08 サラダ油に流されて変わってゆく私をあなたは時々遠くで叱って。
1014 2018-10-30 21:39:58 I need an oil change, winter tires, a new laptop and a new phone all at the same time 
1015 2018-10-30 21:39:55 Now that asphalt has to pay more money for that oil because 112 passed and now oil companies have to charge more for oil since it cost more to obtain then our asphalt prices raise. And then your tax dollars increase because now building a road cost 25% more because 112 passed 3/4
1016 2018-10-30 21:39:42 It was the point I was making. The far right got in because the other lot were notoriously corrupt and in bed with the Petrobras oil company and others.
1017 2018-10-30 21:39:38 let me ask, and I'm not trying to be any kind of way, but, at what mileage DO these people become "invaders".    1K, 500, 100, 10..??  -500?
1018 2018-10-30 21:39:35 I believe I read that in 2010 a pipeline, carrying diluted bitumen burst in Michigan Kalamazoo River. 250 Commercial vessels go through the harbour now and the pipeline will increase that traffic by sevenfold. Increasing the risk of oil spills. Directly affecting BC economics.
1019 2018-10-30 21:39:08 I don’t want nothing to do with that flavorless oil 
1020 2018-10-30 21:39:06 Hi JP...
1021 2018-10-30 21:39:05 They will carry ebo you will think it's Trick or Treat
That's how you will eat pap , egg and palm oil saying Treat 
1022 2018-10-30 21:39:02 My Dad would approve. Green diesel is for the tractor, removing oil based paint off small children* and lighting bonfires* but not for fuelling road worthy vehicles 

*not 100% these uses are legal
1023 2018-10-30 21:38:56 Some pretty major infrastructure runs on VBA scripts in excel. I can think of at least one gas & oil pipeline network which “works” this way - they use vnc to access it.
1024 2018-10-30 21:38:52 I’ve used coconut oil for something else before but never for my face  I have it on my window in reach 
1025 2018-10-30 21:38:50 Why can't people just say Castor Oil instead of Opening Medicine? 
1026 2018-10-30 21:38:44 So Republicans and Democrats have similar goals and interests? One wants to stop our most profitable market of oil and the other doesn't believe our planet is being destroyed. There couldn't be a bigger difference in interest. Are you saying both are wrong?
1027 2018-10-30 21:38:37 So any company using that oil it will effect. Small sample size. Asphalt companies use that oil. 112 passes and now oil has to spend more money to directionally bore underground to get the same oil that they’d get without 112, just in a different, more expensive way. 2/3
1028 2018-10-30 21:38:34 草でしょ
1029 2018-10-30 21:38:31 You bombed your own city with airplanes killing thousands to start a war for oil... do you really wanna play this game??
1030 2018-10-30 21:38:28 For the meantime. I need to do my cars inspection, oil change and my registration and continuing saving for Christmas
1031 2018-10-30 21:38:21 Now, now, none of that! Tsking at you, Paul!  It a wonderful self portrait. I love the drama and open hand with the oil brush, showing your interest and offering of fine art. Awesome.
1032 2018-10-30 21:38:18 tfw I live in a house from 1900 but it had an old oil furnace, and as a result it doesn't have a fire place.
1033 2018-10-30 21:38:03 Abi o..D are all crazy
1034 2018-10-30 21:37:55 Premium MF! You used pears oil yh??
1035 2018-10-30 21:37:53 Coconut oil is expensive and overrated. Why pay all that when I can get it from my mans for the freeeeeee 
1036 2018-10-30 21:37:50 WATCH: Gwenyth Paltrow and Senator Palpatine Make A Sweet Facial Cream out of Ion Cannons and 7 Essential Oil Diffusers
1037 2018-10-30 21:37:44 Why the vegetable oil when seasoning? It seems like burgers have enough fat on their own to brown while cooking etc.
1038 2018-10-30 21:37:35 Hate Speech includes many words,  the moment the victim feels a victim ( fear of harm) e.g. “hate speech leads to hate acts” a “hate incident” has occurred under 18 U.S Code 249 and charges are possible.

PM: @MERUMAYA Mineral cleansing paste, @GoldfadenMD Skin balancing skin mask...
1041 2018-10-30 21:37:24 Whoever is producing Aboniki balm should brand it as massage oil and export it to Europe. I have not seen a better “massage oil” than Aboniki balm. Thank me later 
1042 2018-10-30 21:37:19 Interesting read. I’ll just say this on 112. I know a lot of people look at this as a “rich man republican hates it.” Just consider this. That bill not only effects the oil companies, but it also effects all companies that purchase and use that oil 1/2
1043 2018-10-30 21:37:16 ถ้าย้อนเวลากลับไปได้

1045 2018-10-30 21:37:00 So how much was brought forward from 2014 oil proceeds? How come out reserve is depleting when crude price is rising?
1046 2018-10-30 21:36:55 Aye this shit is cheap and easy just make baked cauliflower with olive oil, sea salt, and pepper. That shit changed my life
1047 2018-10-30 21:36:52 That’s how I feel when I use castor oil lol
1048 2018-10-30 21:36:40 I use to do oil and chocolate pudding wrestling when i was 18 yrs old and started in this buisness and these girls use to kick my ass i was so skinny back then lol  Good times!
1049 2018-10-30 21:36:39 Open borders, higher taxes, no oil from the ground and impeach Trump for yet to be named crimes.  Vote Robert O'Rourke, the nation's most famous Irish Hispanic!
1050 2018-10-30 21:36:38 Dangote was given monopoly and till today he is fighting competitors in court . Is he a role model for you? Adenuga received funding from someone that made money from coveted govt wealth and oil wells. If he is a role model for you good for you. We should not disillusion our kids
1051 2018-10-30 21:36:36 I’m trying to go natural on a budget too. Coconut oil wasn’t cutting it. 
1052 2018-10-30 21:36:31 It's like all fraudsters are into Oil and gas these days.
1053 2018-10-30 21:36:26 I came to say that my beard is showing signs that's its filling in.

S/o castor oil. Tea tree oil. Jojoba oil and peppermint oil.

1054 2018-10-30 21:36:24 Pumping gas, checking oil, washing the windows- back when gas stations offered SERVICE!
1055 2018-10-30 21:36:22 When CJ and I were setting up a schedule, we both agreed that people in this country are going to NEED some big doses of hemp oil after the midterms! It is, after all, a great brain-soother. 
1056 2018-10-30 21:36:14 And most of the other 25% is for soya oil, which isn’t due to vegans either.
1057 2018-10-30 21:36:11 I prefer batteries. Most hydrogen is produced by splitting CO2 from natural gas. So it does not really decrease the carbon footprint. Plus you are once again the mercy of very few suppliers who can dictate prices like with oil.
1058 2018-10-30 21:36:05 Faith doesn’t have 2 make sense. Once u get them on the blind faith train, u can take ‘em anywhere. Neocons hate that such a vile & ignorant man has co-opted the flock. But they cultivated and nursed a following so ignorant, they don’t even recognize a snake oil salesman! /end
1059 2018-10-30 21:36:03 my recipe for frittata:

1061 2018-10-30 21:35:50 I apologize to all the copepods of the world for pointing out this particular Calanus' oil sac. I also apologize to the squirrel I teased earlier today. I know he needs his paunch to get through the winter (though he looked like he's trying to get though next summer, too)
1062 2018-10-30 21:35:50 Why don't you put on some OLIVE  oil and do a massage to your shoulders and neck? You have to keep it warm
1063 2018-10-30 21:35:34 Civility memo missed some of them
1064 2018-10-30 21:35:12 OIL, money

Fix up please.
1067 2018-10-30 21:34:59 Whats next? Toilet paper going to be too white?

1070 2018-10-30 21:34:46 Tariffs and an incumbent. Montana also doesn't have the oil industry like western ND has.
1071 2018-10-30 21:34:45 Sweet solve it with the existing tax revenue you have.   Start with the 4-5 billion you bought that dirty oil pipeline with.
1072 2018-10-30 21:34:40 I use oil with your mother
1073 2018-10-30 21:34:39 My Mom took that photo and I think she didn't care for my Mom all that mch. Very oil and water personalities, but she was always sweet to me. Married my GI Uncle and I think she'd been through some stuff during WW2.

1077 2018-10-30 21:33:45 Great visual on how we Canadians cut our own balls off while bending over for Trump.  We need to get the pipeline built so we can get fare market value and options for our crude oil. Not what Uncle Sam says it’s worth. Bye bye Trudeau. Just sayn
1078 2018-10-30 21:33:27 Indeed! What ever next ?

1082 2018-10-30 21:33:12 You have to love when you bring your car into the dealership for an oil change, and the mechanic treats you like absolute crap for the time you show up, even though you’ve shown up at the EXACT time the person on the phone told you to come in. #seriously #terriblecustomerservice
1083 2018-10-30 21:33:10 Most? Hes right this issue is ripe for an advocacy from both sides. Its unsettled law, which is a rarity. Consider the issue of the definition of " natural born citizen. " an open legal issue, all this time

1098 2018-10-30 21:31:36 No honest! I heard it on the radio the other day & I've searched on it & it's a thing. Also if cool & chill then reheat. Or of course can just soak 24 hrs in water & rinse b4 cooking - but the coconut oil method saves water obvs.
1099 2018-10-30 21:31:36 Next oil change, I will just brorrow some of that oil in you hair.
1100 2018-10-30 21:31:34 With elections being over, Iran sanctions, Trump/Xi meeting, and rumors of OPEC considering reduction post election. Could be interesting times to finish out the year. Thank goodness, oil was getting boring.

1103 2018-10-30 21:31:16 And you think the tax dollars that go into federal and provincial programs are worth more to politicians than the millions of dollars they personally get from Exxon and other oil conglomerates?
1104 2018-10-30 21:31:01 ugh the election is so close and I still don’t know how I should vote on prop 1 (backers say it’ll protect salmon, opponents say it’ll prevent even small development projects, big oil companies are against it but so are Native corps, I can’t tell which side is fearmongering)
1105 2018-10-30 21:30:59 Way too late on this but usually I throw a bunch of plum or cherry tomatoes in the oven, drizzle of olive oil, dried oregano and crushed garlic. Season well and cook at 200° for half hour and mash up. Simplicity is best.

Congress has limited control over public lands and oil companies only search for oil because you buy it. Boycott gasoline and demand will drop. Stop preaching and do something real.

1117 2018-10-30 21:29:27 Does anyone there think about regressive nature of tariffs? Or cost of Trump-Saudi-investment bank collabs to get oil price higher? Or cost to world growth & US exports of collapses in Turkey, Pakistan, AR, Italy, $DB etc? Housing, autos have cooled; what they wanna accomplish?

1141 2018-10-30 21:27:33 You may not be corrupt sir, but the situation in Nigeria at the moment require sincere collaborative efforts to stair us out of crisis.

1165 2018-10-30 21:24:50 @SecPompeo From the very first day it was clear that you are corrupt and you are just trying to deceive the people, Iran's poor and traitorous group always said that Iran's oil exports are zero, but in practice it did not.
1166 2018-10-30 21:24:48 But that's how it always been. The gold rush, the oil boom, the Dotcom market, the housing market. Each time people thought things would stay the same and be stable, each time it collasped.

1239 2018-10-30 21:14:01 Fries with truffle oil and parmesan are TRASH come for me
1240 2018-10-30 21:13:55 Currently behind a lifted Chevy truck w/ a bumper sticker that says “waste oil” like yeah just fuck the environment right? 
1241 2018-10-30 21:13:43 Why can’t y’all report it right!!!! The student was vaping concentrated CBD oil.....not simply vaping
1242 2018-10-30 21:13:33 Oil Money FC have to spend at least 20 years at the top to even rival Liverpool and United but you’re too busy screaming after a few years of success to see how little the rest of the footballing world cares about you #ArabiaFC #OilMoneyFC #PlasticFC
1243 2018-10-30 21:13:26 We need to destroy SV’s self-delusion that they’re any different, or better, than oil or tobacco companies. They will NEVER choose to care, they must be forced to by our laws. Unless their ability to profit is threatened, or their execs must fear prison, they won’t change.
1244 2018-10-30 21:13:24 coolant, both serp belts, timing and oil/balance belt, every fucking gasket, water pump, thermostat. anything else im probably forgetting...
1245 2018-10-30 21:13:22 you need to go get your oil changed
1246 2018-10-30 21:13:14 If Melania’s heels were a 1/4 inch longer she would have struck oil!

1249 2018-10-30 21:12:42 How about this? Seitan steak stewed with miso sauce. Toast toasted white bread with olive oil and chopped leeks. Serve immediately.
1250 2018-10-30 21:12:15 The only oil rich countries that make a lot of money off oil are not in the EU
1251 2018-10-30 21:12:04 Voted and already mailed my ballot in!  In a democratic state, we still had heaps of misinformation, lies, and big money (oil) misinforming voters!  Hoping for people to get involved this round!
1252 2018-10-30 21:12:04 Gas pipelines are different from oil pipelines the risks and contents are different. can’t compare the two fairly. BCOGC & NEB are responsible for making sure the pipeline company is following maintenance requirements. a bitumen pipeline will never explode @kmaemaier @HWYWHoney

1257 2018-10-30 21:11:17 The world-class (by environmental and human-rights standards)  oil & gas industry has been teleconferencing in place of physical travel for years. Skype / Facetime call between Calgary & Fort McMurray, no problem! #ClimateBarbie would learn a thing or two if she wasn’t a zealot

1259 2018-10-30 21:11:03 With all due respect, educate yourself on the topic and the MANY facets that hinge on law and not emotion. Way too much ignorance, emotion  online,  and too little educated commentary
1260 2018-10-30 21:10:41 Yep absolutely! Gotta think of your food as fuel for your body. (Kinda Like putting the best oil in your car possible type of thing.)
1261 2018-10-30 21:10:29 Cbd hemp oil maybe

1265 2018-10-30 21:09:59 "Bullish bets on US crude #Oil outnumbered bearish ones by 4-to-1. The ratio is the lowest since October 2017 and compares with a 26-to-1 ratio from early July" CFTC
1266 2018-10-30 21:09:52 The creation of a vibrant industry to improve and further the use of renewable energy will create new long term job. these oil & gas lobby groups pay big money to further interests that won’t help NZ or the world going forward, just line their pockets.
1267 2018-10-30 21:09:12 So, Jacob Wohl gonna get a visit from the @FBI? more slippery than an eel in oil.
1268 2018-10-30 21:08:58 Radical enough to land Australia in the Hague in dispute with Timor Leste after Howards grab for oil/gas reserves as per the article I just linked linked not radical enough for you? O well, I don't want to discuss immigration you brought that subject up, thanks for kind regards
1269 2018-10-30 21:08:57 Today, oil fell on my eye at work, I got most of it off but some stayed on my eyelashes. I now have the up most respect for women that wear mascara on a daily basis. I have no clue how y’all don’t blink y’all selves to death?
1270 2018-10-30 21:08:49 Tea tree is amazing! I also used to warm a lil olive oil in the microwave, then massage my scalp with it for like 5-10 minutes, then take a shower and massage the shampoo in just like the oil.
1271 2018-10-30 21:08:45 Finally something that fish oil is actually possibly good for....more data please!!

1273 2018-10-30 21:08:03 What? What's unethical about being a journalist in a state where his wife is campaigning. Is it about her and her campaign? No it's about the disgusting oil and gas industry making people sick so they can make money. Maybe you're a shill for the oil and gas companies?

1276 2018-10-30 21:07:53 yeah Aldi is fine for most things, but I've realized their olive oil and salt are really not very good, and I want to be a good cook! Learned SO much from SFAH. 
1277 2018-10-30 21:07:52 Maybe they could help them get some oil topside, oh wait, that's right, Rus is a bulk oil seller, they don't want any competition driving the price down, so, everyone will continue to receive refugee's from a broken land
1278 2018-10-30 21:07:51 dermorganic’s leave in argan oil is amazing, changing up your shampoo+conditioner products can help too, i really like shea moisture’s raw shea butter moisture retention shampoo and conditioner!
1279 2018-10-30 21:07:51 Yea but we know that trip in the middle east was about oil and and revenge 4 Saddam going after his daddy. They're going to keep guns on the streets cuz its keeping money in their pocket. If it benefits them they'll find reason and a way to make it happen.

1285 2018-10-30 21:07:28 I am 73 and the use of CBD oil and Marijuana itself [smoked mixed with tobacco European-style] has made me a new man! I feel all over better than I have in 20 years! Pain gone, nerves better, gives me a quiet comfort that 
has delivered me out of depression and suicidal thoughts!
1286 2018-10-30 21:07:24 Demoncraft Pres. OBOMA never visited Nigeria all through his 8yrs , but instead put a stop to Nigerian US VISA LOTTERY! Yet the USA drinks our oil & natural resources like CocaCola!
If you're Nigerian & still a die hard fan of the conspirators na OYO you dey! #BLEXIT 
1287 2018-10-30 21:07:23 Followed by the time I mistakenly stomped that bounty to death after tying him up....just a series of accidentally being the typical Wild West bad guy...when all I want to do is say “Howdy” and being a snake oil salesman to justice.

1291 2018-10-30 21:07:05 Well that's my massage table and oil purchased! Next week I'll be ready to get cracking!
1292 2018-10-30 21:06:53 We're pushing for an end to oil exploration, not for people to stop using oil now. We have to phase it out, it needs to be a just transition, but there is no choice, it has to happen.
 #ClimateChange
1293 2018-10-30 21:06:51 i wish i actually knew but yeah the only thing that kinda works for me is getting enough sleep, rosehip oil, vitamin c and i sometimes put ice on them cause im a crackhead :p
1294 2018-10-30 21:06:47 i’m crying over vegetable oil.
1295 2018-10-30 21:06:30 CBD oil the non psycho active part of cannabis.  I have a friend that used to have horrible migraines, started using it, gone.
1296 2018-10-30 21:06:20 Cut farm and oil subsidies. Make cattle grazers pay real fees for grazing on public land. Make dirtydonald pay back taxes owed.
1297 2018-10-30 21:06:11 It was famously said that the US was an oil company with an army.
1298 2018-10-30 21:05:47 The UK doesn't trade it's oil or gas using the global market price. 
That isn't how the UK profits from these resources.
The UK gives our oil and gas away for free.

This article is just silly. It's designed to appeal to the ignorant.
1299 2018-10-30 21:05:41 Yes and many money folks have oil sticks and own few farms.
1300 2018-10-30 21:05:41 No one has the power to shatter this male beauty. Awesome selfies "Oil Tot" and I'm glad you made it home safe. Now you did your part now it's time to eat and rest so you can have more days of that "Teddy Bear Cute" smile!
1301 2018-10-30 21:05:35 Can the government just admit that the country is very poor instead of pulling this mendacity. So many states can't afford that minimum wage without the support of oil rents. This is 2018 and states can't survive without the federal government support.
1302 2018-10-30 21:05:18 Got a great leg workout, then puked. Made sure to spend 5 minutes on the inversion table. Got somewhat sick again for the walk home. Tasted fish oil in the back of my throat while somewhat nauseous. Violently puked to the point of stomach cramps. Regained composure. Walked home.
1303 2018-10-30 21:05:07 Unbelievable first Kanye West goes to the WH to talk to the president freeway and honestly he’s a token black guy,Trump goes to Pennsylvania to express condolences to the Jewish community, And he’s a anti-Semite doing it for optics, see America those are the true Bigots DEMOCRATS

1308 2018-10-30 21:04:36 Nobody pays double than before, she also said there was no oil in Scotland anymore, she must be a troll
1309 2018-10-30 21:04:35 I do not understand what is happening with my skin. I thought it would clear up with the cool down but it hasn't. I wash my face every day, use a toner, and an oil, and I still break out. Today I went without the oil and I have new blemishes. Idgi
1310 2018-10-30 21:04:26 Essential oil candles are my favorite.
1311 2018-10-30 21:04:21 Bitches be crazy and when I say bitches I mean all these fuck boys out here thinking they're as slick as oil fuck yall
1312 2018-10-30 21:04:19 It’s costing Canada 92 billion in revenue per year by refusing to get Canadian oil to the rest of Canada & to market while we ship in Saudi Oil at 1,222,000,000 a year. 
You see where you’re news is a little slanted........
1313 2018-10-30 21:04:07 All my oil changes have been free since I got my new car last year GOD IS GOOD
1314 2018-10-30 21:03:44 Got some spare oil heaters in garage if you want to borrow..can't get them to you tonight though
1315 2018-10-30 21:03:44 Crap - centrism is practical - it goes with what works rather than the dogmas of left or right - which generally don't work other than for those with the right contacts to insulate them.
Think oil rich #Venezuela ?
1316 2018-10-30 21:03:42 I did! Then tossed them in some olive oil and sesame oil, little salt and some pepper flakes, 400 degrees for about 7 Min Then tossed them in my belly! Ha!
1317 2018-10-30 21:03:33 Brent crude fell by US$1.43 or 1.8% to US$75.91 a barrel, and the US Nymex price fell by US86 cents or 1.3% to US$66.18 a barrel. 
#ausbiz #markets #oil #oilprice #aufindaily
1318 2018-10-30 21:03:25 I need new tires and an oil change like yesterday.
1319 2018-10-30 21:03:17 But ‘mr farmer’ is too busy farming to keep such a close eye on oil, gas, CME futures... harvest, blackgrass, machinery breakdowns, seed beds, soil structure, managing staff etc etc all get in the way.... at least the fert is now a known cost. Lots of other things aren’t.....
1320 2018-10-30 21:03:15 DRAG HIM
1321 2018-10-30 21:03:03 You demand other people stop using oil and gas while using it yourself. At the very least you could stop portraying these companies as villains, recognise the massive benefit they bring to our lives and that it's a lot harder than you make out to stop using oil and gas overnight.
1322 2018-10-30 21:02:54 Funny that, the unexpected bonus in revenues of £6Bn is due to increase in Oil Revenues. Better not tell him that, might upset him.
1323 2018-10-30 21:02:25 Great Canadian oil change
1324 2018-10-30 21:02:22 Thats some revisionist history you got there. Venezuela has a long and troubled history of corruption. After Hugo Chavez' assumed power in a coup and nationalized the oil companies, he used the profits to enrich himself and spend on lavish social programs (buying support)...
1325 2018-10-30 21:02:09 Finding somewhere to get a decent priced oil change is aggravating
1326 2018-10-30 21:01:54 Which food are you people talking about, that plain rice and oil, mk una talk another tin , that school feeding is one of the biggest fraudulent acts of @MBuhari and @APCNigeria administration #scamgov #PMBAPC

1329 2018-10-30 21:01:24 Oh, I feel you! It is such a struggle between budget and quality! My family is Lebanese though, so olive oil is important! I cut corners on other stuff. lol.

1331 2018-10-30 21:01:21 @PepsiCo When are YOU going to stop your relentless pursuit of palm oil, which is destroying the rainforest and the dwindling orangutan population???
1332 2018-10-30 21:01:20 I don't have a southern accent or anything but I definitely pronounce oil as ool and toilet as towlit. At least I Don't pronounce back as Bayck
1333 2018-10-30 21:01:13 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.

1343 2018-10-30 21:00:11 Always keeping it simple ,castor oil + glycerine + water. Apple cider vinegar and sulphate free shampoo
1344 2018-10-30 21:00:09 October 30, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1345 2018-10-30 21:00:08 The oil would certainly continue flowing. The business would continue operating. The vast majority of the employees would remain in place.
1346 2018-10-30 21:00:08 I work at o Reilly and we don’t even get free oil changes

1351 2018-10-30 20:59:50 Hey @JeepCares my wife took her ‘13 wrangler for an oil change with coupon for $19.99 to CJDR South Savannah. When she went to pick up they charged her $60 and said it required synthetic. Not cool bait and switch. Thought you should know.
1352 2018-10-30 20:59:45 Maybe! But, with increasing doses of CBD oil, I have yet to see an effect. Always back to Xanax and Buspar to deal with the anxiety from my sister's suicide (a year ago today.) So, today is not the day to engage me in debate on this, whoever you are!
1353 2018-10-30 20:59:43 Well. Better to have someone who shows understanding than the one who is asked a question on corruption and he is talking about oil companies.
1354 2018-10-30 20:59:38 Don't mind them Oga Segun they sold their birth-rite just for plate of soup. Jagaban want Petroleum Minister and oil rig for His brother and he has committed PMB to signed the agreement. otifete watch out. Me am voting for Oby not BuTiku.
1355 2018-10-30 20:59:26 who has extra engine oil that they are not using?
1356 2018-10-30 20:58:58 You can arguably factor in the cost of the Iraq war, a war to protect Western oil supplies. Cost us about £10billion at least.

Add to that the humanitarian costs.
1357 2018-10-30 20:58:53 Every ¢50 - $1 spent on combating #AirPollution in Asia, promises $20 of returns in economic growth.

2 shipping fuels
3 oil well gases
4 cooking & fertilisers
5 post combustion & road vehicles
6 crackers
1358 2018-10-30 20:58:23 The poor people elected Chavez and it worked until they ran out of other people's money. He borrowed too much on the oil money.
1359 2018-10-30 20:58:21 My dad would always just take my car to get the oil change for me so now I’m really out here adulting
1360 2018-10-30 20:58:19 Righ, because Iraq was major oil producing country (it wasn't). Afghanistan didn't have much in the way of resources that the US needed, if I remember correctly

1366 2018-10-30 20:57:51 Any time I take my car for an oil change I remember why I’d rather do it myself
1367 2018-10-30 20:57:50 I’ve had a car for 3 1/2 years and this is the first time I ever take it to get an oil change on my own...
1368 2018-10-30 20:57:46 The US is not stealing Syria's oil. The only ones who have done that have Daesh and Turkey. If anything, it is TURKEY who wants access to those eastern oilfields. Think about it. If Turkey got hold of those fields, it will never leave Syria.

1371 2018-10-30 20:57:07 They rub the ball to get the oil off the ball that naturally come on it( the percent off pitchers that don’t use tar) usually that’s when people use to spit on it and shit but that’s old school.
1372 2018-10-30 20:57:00 Every 20-year-old MAGA superstar has the personality of, like, an oil tycoon's youngest son who refused to learn to read and had an on call wet-nurse throughout high school.

1374 2018-10-30 20:56:53 Remember the self-proclaimed chosen race of God lost 77% of it's oil imports from the Peshmerga-controlled Kurdish reigon of Northern Iraq, after @realDonaldTrump refused to back Kurdish secession and to give them anymore air support. Iraq wiped them out in a mere 36 hours.

1377 2018-10-30 20:56:30 Barry's Communist Agenda tried to ban coal, oil, and "skyrocket the price of energy". He was the first president EVER to not achieve 3% GDP growth. He said jobs weren't coming back. “…Well, how exactly are you going to negotiate that? What magic wand do you have?”
1378 2018-10-30 20:56:19 I suppose the answer to that is what we've already alluded to: what they've got up their sleeves is payoffs from lobbyists and stakeholders in the oil and gas industry
1379 2018-10-30 20:56:18 You'll need to explain what you mean by maximising land use - maximising for what? Extracting maximum profit from it? Buildings, farming, wind-farms, solar farms? Cutting down rain forest for palm oil and beef cattle isn't wise.

1388 2018-10-30 20:54:40 its not about getting oil, its about making sure syrians cant get it.
1389 2018-10-30 20:54:22 Sounds like I need to start grinding up my toenail clippings and selling as genuine extinct rhino-powder-snake-oil. I mean, if there’s a market for keratin I guess we can all pitch in...toe-jam and all!
1390 2018-10-30 20:54:21 (California Olive Ranch is the freshest olive oil I've found, but it is hella expensive, so if you find a good alternative, drop a recommendation!)
1391 2018-10-30 20:54:13 It is so frustrating to take good care of your car and keep up with oil changes etc like you're supposed to just to always have something else go wrong.

1406 2018-10-30 20:51:31 It's even sadder that after 40 years of conservative governments, they couldn't figure out how to diversify and fun programs without a high price on oil.

1416 2018-10-30 20:49:07 And you gave no cares about the consittution, the rampant racism, the fake emergency on the border, the national defrauding of voters, or anythiing else you and your party did, but you damn sure helped the oil keep pumping. The oil companies that pay you must be so proud.

1421 2018-10-30 20:48:35 I’m just going to buy a bicycle to drive around because $78 for an oil change is not ok.
1422 2018-10-30 20:48:29 Ooh shit she shakin the table!! Regular or gel? Or u fancy with the creamy baby oil??
1423 2018-10-30 20:48:26 Lol nah I mean the cost of the oil change is more than what my car is worth
1424 2018-10-30 20:48:16 Correction*

Crude +5.69mm (+3.2mm exp)
Cushing +1.44mm (+2.1mm exp)
Gasoline -3.5mm
Distillates -3.1mm

#oil #gas #OOTT
1425 2018-10-30 20:47:45 Then be done again lol smaller parts always equal the whole, and the oil is still used regardless, but you do not work for Chevron, do you? Do you access their quality? Probably all just assumptions still.
1426 2018-10-30 20:47:43 As I am co wash, Cantu leave in, Africa’s best fab 5 oil, & Cantu moisturizing curl activator. Dassit!
1427 2018-10-30 20:47:33 Pathetic, has she always been this clueless, or has she just bought into the snake oil Trump has been selling?
1428 2018-10-30 20:47:13 Gracias
1429 2018-10-30 20:47:11 Adaptation is key to thriving in the #oilandgas industry but as H&P’s John Lindsay puts it, “success is one of the biggest inhibitors of change.” The #oil price cycle helps keep you nimble. #DeloitteOilGas
1430 2018-10-30 20:47:01 Wrap it in foil before checking her oil
1431 2018-10-30 20:46:56 Exactly Marilyn, as we kmow Both Putin ABD Trump are Sbti-Communism stalwarts and will try to keep China from taking over Venezuela and their vast oil, one of the world's largest.
Altho, I'm not sure if Putin will let Trump take over Russia's Naval Ports in Venezuela, we'll see.
1432 2018-10-30 20:46:50 first, buy d egusi, then chop into desired sizes, add water nd and oil. Boil. Ready
1433 2018-10-30 20:46:26 You can exfoliate your lips once a week by using sugar and olive oil.
1434 2018-10-30 20:46:20 I've been using bio oil but I've been slacking a little. And a product called scar away. I'm going to research some other products soon
1435 2018-10-30 20:46:20 Well I took my car in to the new mechanic for an oil change and they do a 40 point check. I went there to get away from the high prices of the dealership. Me just get a call to say my struts are leaking and it is going to cost $1000. My heart is still pounding. 
1436 2018-10-30 20:46:12 You should let me take you out... you should go change the oil in my car sir!
1437 2018-10-30 20:46:09 Baby oil  y’all irritating
1438 2018-10-30 20:45:57 Lol I’m going to oil up & take more 
1439 2018-10-30 20:45:54 Some of us have intentionally decided to focus on the oil sale as if she tried begging for the sympathy of the people? Oil comment was even less than 1 sec of the whole interview. Why focus on that?
1440 2018-10-30 20:45:24 You’re right, items one and two are things as a provincial politician he would have no jurisdiction over so I guess this guy’s a separatist! When you wanna export oil oversees being landlocked is not such a good idea 
1441 2018-10-30 20:45:20 Next time let me rub that cocoanut oil on ya
1442 2018-10-30 20:45:20 A woman who uses CBD oil due to a life-threatening illness says she cannot access oil legally through the government pot shop. "These government sotres are not offering me the opportunity to fight for my life," she said. #kamloops
1443 2018-10-30 20:45:08 Ahah....Fine Potato
Is just that Oil is now cozt!!!
1444 2018-10-30 20:45:07 Well supplied oil market with an increasing demand ...i guess that would imply increasing supply? What about trying to contribute to net 0? Sounds like some fine doublespeak
1445 2018-10-30 20:44:52 Apparently my dad spilled some oil in the garage and my bitch ass almost busted myself cause of it
1446 2018-10-30 20:44:50 Apparently Lubbuck wants partial birth abortion, gun control, open borders, amnesty for 11M illegal aliens, $10/barrel oil tax, anti-Israel policies.  All these policies are advocated by Ultra liberal Beto.  VOTE CRUZ
1447 2018-10-30 20:44:43 thank you Jesus for melatonin pills, an essential oil diffuser and lavender. I’m going to sleep great tonight.
1448 2018-10-30 20:44:31 The whole country is paying the costs of climate change.  Maybe if we're serious about climate policy we could start by recognizing that a free pass for oil because it's important to Alberta has consequences for all of us.
1449 2018-10-30 20:44:29 GUYANA is known as the Land  of Many Waters & The Fruit Basket of the Caribbean.

1452 2018-10-30 20:44:00 There was a report on BNN that BP made huge profits off the cheap Canadian oil and is reinvesting it in US shale plays.
1453 2018-10-30 20:43:30 almost forgot to oil my legs today cos in the dream I was gisting with Gla and oiling my legs so I thought I had it covered

1455 2018-10-30 20:43:15 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.
1456 2018-10-30 20:43:11 Sustainable certified palm oil is still damaging our environment and destroying the homes of helpless animals. How about not using any palm oil at all?
1457 2018-10-30 20:43:03 Went to get my oil changed today and and the mechanic told me I need 844$ for my car to drive like new  boy damn you long as the bitch drive ion care how It drive

1459 2018-10-30 20:42:31 Coconut oil to fix everything? No! Apple. Cider. Vinegar.
1460 2018-10-30 20:42:25 - Oil changes are a thing of the past

1464 2018-10-30 20:42:04 Great Canadian Oil Change, I know if you go there like 5x your 6th is free or something.. That’s where I take my Denali
1465 2018-10-30 20:42:01 I honestly think it depends on the person.  Cross contamination is hard to avoid so some people don’t mind.

Like i know they drop chicken in the same oil as they make my fries in but I’m still gonna eat those fries despite the cross contamination.  That’s just me tho
1466 2018-10-30 20:41:36 Apply grease/oil Nah...  Easy penetration 
1467 2018-10-30 20:41:34 14m Cushing build? Gas and oil both down 3 each, so could be net bullish

1473 2018-10-30 20:41:10 Our 4 19th century Exchanges - Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow & Aberdeen wrre merged into the Scottish Stock Exchange in 1964 - perfectly centralised to trade in Scottish oil by the start of the following decade. London had other plans, of course. Sheer colonial exploitation.
1474 2018-10-30 20:41:03 Since she is unable to reveal the name of the employer, we can . Am I right in saying it's Stork oil and gas?
1475 2018-10-30 20:41:01 @frankelly08 @RNBreakfast Why are we tolerating price gouging for redundant petrol? It’s time we send a message to overseas oil companies by going 100% electric #petrolprices
1476 2018-10-30 20:41:01 Or the government could wage a War on Carbon Emissions. You know, like the War on Drugs. I'm sure the oil and gas industry would LOVE the same results that war has gotten.
1477 2018-10-30 20:40:52 @AkinwunmiAmbode can u see dis?
1478 2018-10-30 20:40:48 Grigio Holiday: one ". This all-star trio features well received and nuts, is the world; it is bright and toffee almonds, olive oil
1479 2018-10-30 20:40:43 Almost 80% of what we consumed are imported we only export crude oil and it drop drastically from over $100 per barrel to below $30 per barrel, hw  can u expect all this things to remain constant when u export nothing. Pls be wise nd think wel. Militant came nd destroy every thin
1480 2018-10-30 20:40:32 Mais ou menos. A GE está se desfazendo do braço financeiro, mas a) a contabilidade é toda cagada, b) a compra da Alstom foi um desastre, c) investir em Oil & Gas não foi uma boa e por aí vai.

1482 2018-10-30 20:40:26 Water and oil just don't mix.
1483 2018-10-30 20:40:18 Sadly Traitor trudeau and his inept liberals hate Canadian oil so they tax it and regulate it to death and allow OPEC oil to be exempt from the same rules @aboutpipelines @OilGasCanada @jkenney @OilsandsAction @PremierScottMoe @SohiAmarjeet #NEP2 #Alberta #Canada #TrudeauMustGo

1489 2018-10-30 20:39:27 In oil and gas here, some companies had a liquor cabinet and fridge full of beer. They would stop at 3 and bring out the drinks. I never indulged. Not a big drinker.
1490 2018-10-30 20:39:27 Got my car deep cleaned and an oil change 
1491 2018-10-30 20:39:23 Run a hot steamy bath and add a few drops of olbas oil. Eat teaspoons of Manuka honey to boost your immune system and put vapour rub on your chest before bed. Keep drinking hot drinks as the steam is the best thing to help decongestion. Feel better soon gizzi!
1492 2018-10-30 20:39:12 Your Lining Is Still SUPER FUCKED Girl. I’ll Help You Out..... Black Castor Oil, Coconut Oil, Aloe Vera, Almond Oil && Tea Tree Oil So It Can Stimulate Those Struggle Edges You Have. You’re Welcome Sissy Pooh
1493 2018-10-30 20:39:10 Even Obama had sense enough to make the USA self sufficient with respect to oil. History will not be kind to Gerry or Justin.
1494 2018-10-30 20:39:09 I had that recently, that Vicks First Defence stuff seemed to help. Also steaming my head over a bowl with olbas oil in the water. Also night nurse.

1497 2018-10-30 20:38:54 How is that ban going right now? For a man that wants to ban extremist Muslims he is sure buddy buddy with the Saudi’s corrupt oil people . So I guess the ban is not working
1498 2018-10-30 20:38:51 Srsly fam. If we had Aquatic Ruin instead of Oil Ocean, Marble instead of Green Hill, Mystic Cave instead of Chemical Plant, Quartz Quadrant instead of Stardust Speedway and Tidal Tempest instead of Metallic Madness Mania would have been a way more hype blast of the past.
1499 2018-10-30 20:38:45 how am I supposed to sneak the things I bought past my mom if my oil change feels like it’s going to take ALL NIGHT

1512 2018-10-30 20:36:28 In the crisis of 2007 some US families in the margin of their financial abilities couldn't afford to payback their mortgages anymore after the rise in the oil prices. Crises don't start through the lack of confidence. Lack of confidence comes when crises start to emerge.

1540 2018-10-30 20:32:14 You missed the point then: the American way of life (baseball, hot dogs, apple pie, & Chevrolet) IS controlled by corporations, and there’s no denying it.

In fact, I wish Bush hadn’t denied Iraq invasion wasn’t about “blood 4 oil”: at least he’d be more honest about it...

1634 2018-10-30 20:18:58 今日は何オイルがいいかい?アロマオイルで香りたい?オリーブオイルでイタリアンたい?ふふふ…僕は君のためならどんなオイルにもなってやるさ…
1635 2018-10-30 20:18:57 I find it so interesting how we know that oil drilling is bad for the environment however it is never mentioned how mining for elements for electronics is also bad.

1636 2018-10-30 20:18:45 Thank TMH for CBD oil, because . . .
1637 2018-10-30 20:18:43 Yes they dropped the cost of extraction down to $15 a barrel. These figures by the way are from the Tory budget. Their figures, £350 million a week revenues from oil and gas.
1638 2018-10-30 20:18:42 How does it take nearly two hours to change my oil and rotate the tires. KIA plz
1639 2018-10-30 20:18:33 Crops like cotton and soya we def cant compete...challenge is high pdn costs and poor crop management practices...We always eatin GM..all the soya n cookin oil from SA..bt we jus complain and then waste money buyin the GM stuff anyhow
1640 2018-10-30 20:18:31 I'm not a lawyer, but I do approach issues with facts and rational thought leaving emotion to ppl that form opinions on how they feel. 
This is a huge magnet and would solve a lot of this problem. It has elsewhere
1641 2018-10-30 20:18:22 Cant find no dirty oil, anywhere
1642 2018-10-30 20:18:15 Your questions s/include “Did Jimmy Carter tank the economy& Reagan fix it?”

“Would Obama’s anti-biz policies have destroyed US economy if he hadn’t added $10 T to US debt; let even China gov buy US oil/NG companies & export our energy future; & if HRC had won in 2016?”
1643 2018-10-30 20:18:12 Learning Chinese here is like drinking hot oil and singing the national anthem at the same time
1644 2018-10-30 20:18:06 Didn't say Congress doesn't have the power, they do of course but hopefully won't execute it lightly in this case. Fathers surely thought about illegal aliens I assume, but still defined the 14th.
1645 2018-10-30 20:17:46 I put aging produce on the ground for it. It doesn’t like carrots, but sure does love the black oil sunflower seeds in that feeder. It has to compete with the birds, squirrels, & wild turkeys for those though.
1646 2018-10-30 20:17:44 I had to dissuade my daughter last week from attempting to make doughnuts. Watching this, I'm glad I did. The equipment would have been too pricey to be worth it and hot oil is not a great part of baking with little ones.
1647 2018-10-30 20:17:38 Came to get an oil change and the man helping me is doing a terrible job. SIR HOW ARE YOU GOING TO MOVE MY CAR WITHOUT MY KEYS? Stop starring at me and focus 
1648 2018-10-30 20:17:25 I hate when ling ling wax my eyebrows and put that oily ass oil on my face 
1649 2018-10-30 20:17:24 Just round it up to $21 & then you'll have a little extra for oil changes.
1650 2018-10-30 20:17:07 Essential oils are really the key. I’ve been feeling icky and as soon as I rub this peppermint oil on my stomach I feel so much better!

1657 2018-10-30 20:16:21 Good point. Me see different elements worthy of interest. Briefly (I'd prefer other medium to elaborate) : 1. Kozak speaks about "common methodology" commonly elaborated by Energy & Natural Resources Ministries. Given that shale oil/tight oil are used interchangeably but +
1658 2018-10-30 20:15:56 Oooooo niggas make into an oil bro & vape it lol
1659 2018-10-30 20:15:48 No “ein”.JFK made the same mistakeA Berliner is a traditional German pastry similar to a doughnut with no central hole, made from sweet yeast dough fried in fat or oil, with a marmalade or jam filling and usually icing, powdered sugar or conventional sugar on top.
1660 2018-10-30 20:15:44 Just paid $2.89/gallon for home heating oil!!! OUT Fukeng Rageous!!!! #UnitedConsumerStrike. #ShutDownTheEconomy.
1661 2018-10-30 20:15:39 My stupid feckless skin seems like like Sunday Riley UFO oil despite the fact that it smells like cheap pizza, has an unpleasant texture, and costs $$. What is in there other than 1.5% salicylic that makes it so good?
1662 2018-10-30 20:15:33 I think it's real fish oil, but how can you compare the effect of statins with it? Where did they get this mythical number of 25% ? This is ridiculous. #Amarin #Vascepa #AHA18
1663 2018-10-30 20:15:24 Don't get me started, you can do a weeks shopping but can't buy a liter of oil or a bulb or a wiper blade.

1666 2018-10-30 20:14:50 True plus they got their oil money!
1667 2018-10-30 20:14:35 Economic growth often comes as first consideration, it's because most governments have 1970s economics. And the Tory govt has a lot of wealthy friends in oil and gas.
1668 2018-10-30 20:14:32 Grits can easily be awful but not when they are made properly. The worst was on a cruise where they made them with some kind of oil. In fairness, there things in the Brit cuisine that are awful no matter how they are made.
1669 2018-10-30 20:14:20 I had wondered that same thing when I read this....  it's creepy, it's cool AF, but it's creepy....

1672 2018-10-30 20:14:07 My friend are you blind? the said global Refinery Capacity not base on oil out put.
1673 2018-10-30 20:14:00 Stable 180 temp, and same amount of time on each side (time depends on size). They’re actually pretty easy as long as the oil’s the right temp.
1674 2018-10-30 20:13:32 today I had a doctor appointment, got more blood work, went on base to renew my dependent ID, got an oil change, washed/put up clothes, vacuum, dust, and do some reading...quiet a productive day if you ask me
1675 2018-10-30 20:13:16 Colorado’s elected officials bit by the oil & gas hand that feeds them. There would be poetic justice in this if not for the fact that we citizens and taxpayers will suffer the consequences of this unholy alliance. #NOon74 #YESon112

1679 2018-10-30 20:12:57 I need a haircut and an oil change. They should make a place that does both
1680 2018-10-30 20:12:55 Paul Hollywood is just like a doughnut cooked in low temperature oil: oily and dense. #gbbofinal #gbbo
1681 2018-10-30 20:12:55 Yeah, fried oreos are probably pretty bad for you. Just guessing lol

But it's not the OIL'S FAULT.
1682 2018-10-30 20:12:54 If you overload the fryer the oil will get too cool.
1683 2018-10-30 20:12:39 @atiku To the next president of our time that will make me finally start practicing my ROV Pilot flight in the oil and gas subsea industry as I know he will revive the industry back again. I'm ready to be Atikulated,my friends and family inclusive. #istandtobeAtikulated
1684 2018-10-30 20:12:37 Clearly that's for essential oil... 
1685 2018-10-30 20:12:24 Is Sara Eisen this negative in real life?   JFC.  @cnbc
1686 2018-10-30 20:12:21 How long have citizens of your countries been paying exorbitant income tax rates? Americans are not accustomed to that. Sweden has an auto industry. Norway mines, drills oil, and fishes. Do they have harsh environmental restrictions like the U.S.? Look up American exceptionalism.

1691 2018-10-30 20:11:50 Anadarko Q3 82 cents per share versus 86 cents estimate. Doesn't bode well for the heavy dose of oil company reports remaining this week. $APC
1692 2018-10-30 20:11:42 Nah! The tory's aren't that clever, just practised clones. The real issue is OIL and 'keeping' your grubby hands on it.
1693 2018-10-30 20:11:40 None in the mideast except Iran.
More importantly when has an arab last been singing a bhajan?
This has more to do with the Arabs sucking up to a nation they see as a future superpower & the 2nd largest buyer of their oil after China. 
It's oil dollars mate nothing else.
1694 2018-10-30 20:11:38 sometimes when I'm driving by an oil rig, I pray it just blows up and kills me

1697 2018-10-30 20:11:21 Cheese would help, but that would still be good with a dash of olive oil, some garlic, some kind of green veg, and a balsamic glaze.
1698 2018-10-30 20:11:06 Mom: this sandwich is good but they didn't put the vinegar and oil on it.

1711 2018-10-30 20:10:00 Beyond the right to life and a few other human rights. There are always exceptions, otherwise I’m sure drilling for oil would be heavily restricted if not outlawed as that’s far worse for the environment.
1712 2018-10-30 20:09:58 Did you know? In 1939 the D'Arcy Exploration Company drilled a test bore & found #oil in #Formby? They then set up a field with 18 #pumps working around the clock until 1965, pumping up 72000 barrels of #oil. At peak production, the site was the 2nd biggest oil field in #Britain!

1719 2018-10-30 20:09:18 Looked lately at oil revenues? - remember the costs of extraction, it's the net  figure, not gross, that is more relevant.

1727 2018-10-30 20:08:10 I love my Clarisonic, swear by the thing. I usually “remove” my makeup with either coconut oil or a melting cleansing balm, then wash my face using my Clarisonic and I’m always stunned by how much was still on my face. As for masks, are you looking for traditional style or sheet?

1763 2018-10-30 20:03:49 Of course it is a more complex issue with more constraints, but that’s one of them: making money from selling snake oil (aka that which does not require to solve someone’s problem).

1772 2018-10-30 20:02:02 I’m still crying because I literally just bought the eye oil from @KORAORGANICS 3 days ago and I was so excited to try it out and of course i accidentally dropped it and it shatters everywhere  why is this my life?
1773 2018-10-30 20:01:54 Putin's been celebrating the end of our "sole superpower status" for awhile now.  I'm not saying that our troops didn't fight bravely or sacrifice, but like those who returned from Vietnam said, "It don't mean nothing."  Recent military actions have been to protect oil, not us.
1774 2018-10-30 20:01:52 Why not the MNC? Or the Internet? Or transport companies? Or oil shipment lines? Or electric grids? Governments are just one element of the global civilizational stack.
1775 2018-10-30 20:01:35 Actually our regime is. The only reason Europe hasn't stood up to them is only oil money and nothing else. #IraniansWantRegimeChange
1776 2018-10-30 20:01:30 Yep, discover oil and immediately your only way of controlling your own finances gets shut down.
1777 2018-10-30 20:01:29 Spend $500 on new tires and a oil change, now my battery or ultanator in my car goes bad  it’s always something...

1787 2018-10-30 20:00:36 You're actually providing content and value, and participating in discussion. That's awesome and how an "influencer"  should see themselves, because it's also authentic. Too many just want to sell their audience whatever snake oil their current sponsor is.

1792 2018-10-30 19:59:47 Allen Dulles worked with Prescott Bush and the NAZI's. Allen Dulles is another John Brennan and was involved in Black ops against Cuba. They wanted to use Cuba for oil and drug trafficking. Kill Castro and put a puppet in his place. JFK fired Dulles over the bay of pigs.
1793 2018-10-30 19:59:46 More luck with snake oil!
1794 2018-10-30 19:59:36 For many illnesses. Doesn't have to be smoked either. Can be oil form which is even better for the brain (another whole subject ).  Same with CBD oil.  Big pharma wants to control both.
1795 2018-10-30 19:59:27 Wash the seeds and dry them in a tea towel. Coat with a bit of oil and some salt, pepper and a cheeky bit of chilli or paprika. In the oven for 15 minutes. Nomnomnom, thank me later

1801 2018-10-30 19:58:48 Oh yes, they are completely bought, and even Dems from left wing districts like my representative @RepRickLarsen are completely pro war, pro oil, and for nothing progressive. It's disgusting.
1802 2018-10-30 19:58:36 It's actually simple, even for me 
First you'll sauce the fish/meat and boil for a bit 
Then you'll get another pot and either fry with red oil or boil the egusi. 
Pour the meat water and the meat inside the egusi and chill. When it's done add green(ugu leaf).
1803 2018-10-30 19:58:36 Happens to all of mine! Normally away within a few weeks! Even tried tea tree oil!
1804 2018-10-30 19:58:33 It seems like they find some new problem with my car each time I bring it in. Even for a routine oil change. The idea of buying a new car stresses me out right now.
1805 2018-10-30 19:58:28 When you go to get an oil change and they tell you 5 other things that’s wrong with your car heheheahahaha fml...she runs fine to me ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

1810 2018-10-30 19:58:05 ? Like four years ago oil was selling at over $100 a barrel, but that's all oil, in a global market... Bitumen wasn't cheaper than sweet crude then, it isn't now, and it never will be. It was just more economically viable at that time.
1811 2018-10-30 19:58:05 Good evening boss. Do I dm you?
1812 2018-10-30 19:58:04 1) oil companies biggest cost & which they sink most of budget into is TRO (Tailings Reduction output) Tailings ponds are all gone with the technologies being developed.
Oil companies haven’t stripped mine since early 2000. The dig and fill and reclaim as they go.

1826 2018-10-30 19:55:58 Oil $s went down but the Volume/demand went up.  I expect 2018 to be up in Volume and $$s. expect Price of $Oil to Rise after Elections due to under invest in CapX & Trump pressure off.  US oil Inv builds mostly due to light crude from the Permian. #tesla will see more demand EOY
1827 2018-10-30 19:55:56 Only 9% of US oil comes from Saudi.  Also, comparing the necessity of oil to the WWE is...interesting...to put it politely.
1828 2018-10-30 19:55:53 As well there is the issue of contradiction of use of 14th in this case as it is contrary to the Constitution granting plenary power over nationalization and immigration to Congress. 
Something they dont mention
1829 2018-10-30 19:55:41 The mighty Oil will be the 5% that leafs can’t catch and all my neighbourhood will hear is the noise of 4 suds cracking then Dawna will put an end to it.
1830 2018-10-30 19:55:20 It's in the constitutions for a reason. Why are we confident we know everything better then the founding fathers? But it's ok to discuss. It's just Trump again avoided the truth in his argument.
1831 2018-10-30 19:55:14 baby oil > baby lotion
1832 2018-10-30 19:54:58 The US are not Syria's oil. Israel did not want an Iranian oil pipeline going through Syria, and  leading to the Mediterranean Sea because they enjoy their position as oil middle man in the Middle East. Also they don't want Iran backing Hezbollah via Syria as a conduit.
1833 2018-10-30 19:54:43 I touched the fork I used to take the plantain out of the oil cos I’m obviously an idiot
1834 2018-10-30 19:54:33 My boys have eczema my pediatrician recommended virgin olive oil in their bath water and also said the government aquas cream with a bit of olive oil. All I can say is 3years later they haven't had any breakout
1835 2018-10-30 19:54:32 Welcome chief
1836 2018-10-30 19:54:30 Simply put, where are you going to find the extra £13bn you get after independence. How you going to make up that massive percentage shortfall when oil brings in less that is given away in tuition fees and free prescriptions
1837 2018-10-30 19:54:08 Sounds like an awesome toothpaste! I love using products that contain tea tree oil and would like for my family to give this product!
1838 2018-10-30 19:54:04 One of my favourites, but, like so many others, contains palm oil, so is off my shopping list.
1839 2018-10-30 19:53:54 That makes a lot more sense. She probably sells some good snake oil.
1840 2018-10-30 19:53:51 Wow.... so my folks said I was crazy  and now they are crazy. They probably have been crazy since before April 10th 2002 when they smushed my hand. They used to eat fish from right by oil rigs. The drilling mud has Mercury. They used plastic and styrofoam. Now they are crazy

1843 2018-10-30 19:53:26 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
1844 2018-10-30 19:53:24 I wonder what @sfmta_muni staff personal investments are like - Automotive, Oil & Gas perhaps? I’m assuming @EdReiskin portfolio must be those completely. Oh and perhaps medical insurance companies for the injuries and poor health which result from this type of “planning”.

1847 2018-10-30 19:53:00 The long term odds are against especially with their placement being close to Syrian oil fields. Typical US ploy :-)
1848 2018-10-30 19:53:00 Climate change is a crisis that we must all hold some responsibility for, but yes, billionaires are the world's biggest recipients of fossil fuel interests; Valuing big oil and war for $ over people and planet. More reason why we must champion progressives over corporatists.

1853 2018-10-30 19:52:19 To be fair, snake oil actually worked, people just made a load of fake snake oil so it ended up getting a bad name
1854 2018-10-30 19:52:03 And if @RaoulGMI chart admonition comes into play more pain to come?  Who's economy is accelerating and needing more oil/energy?  Where is the growth coming from?

1859 2018-10-30 19:51:24 One million salutes to you. Please do not let any country such as South Korea or India or China purchasing oil from Iran. Fascism will go down.
1860 2018-10-30 19:51:23 Like I said there is no case law, stare decisis dealing with it. 
There are two sides and if this pushes forward it will go before SCOTUS and be decided. 
This is one side of an undecided argument.

1869 2018-10-30 19:50:53 So if central Kenya feels they are so important why can't they form their own country so that Turkana can have its own fair share from its oil instead of the current paltry 5% and the coast can have its fair share from the ports?
1870 2018-10-30 19:50:40 American values? I don't think he's going to invade another country and kill millions for oil and mic. No, the communists/democratic socialists and their corrupt cronies have been defeated by people power! Yet another country reclaimed from the globalists! Poor Soros

1908 2018-10-30 19:46:32 Mike blocked me, so he won’t see my response. Mike is a waste of skin who uses fear mongering tactics for his own benefit. He doesn’t understand the oil industry, any regulations, or how the world works.
1909 2018-10-30 19:46:08 I would oil you with my vitamins any day 
1910 2018-10-30 19:45:58 During President @edmnangagwa 's meeting with Business leaders yesterday, it emerged that Zim spends US$36 million every month importing Soya Beans & Wheat. This can be reduced to zero if cooking oil manufacturers & Bakeries work with farmers. #BuildZim Cut Imports

1912 2018-10-30 19:45:38 Why is there palm oil in a Tesco Chicken with Caesar style dressing and lettuce in a tomato tortilla?
Surely ppl used to make them before palm oil became a thing
Why does everything you buy have palm oil in it?
What does it do, other than destroy forests ofc.
1913 2018-10-30 19:45:36 Been waiting since 2013 to finally change my trucks oil on my own instead of the dealership doing it for free

1916 2018-10-30 19:45:28 Just finished it the other day and Heat has become my new purpose in life. 

Also, I need to be buying WAY better olive oil and salt.
1917 2018-10-30 19:45:19 Oil filled heat up well
1918 2018-10-30 19:45:06 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1919 2018-10-30 19:44:55 go vegan, switch to solar energy, ditch plastic & palm oil...

1921 2018-10-30 19:44:41 I THOUGHT I NEEDED TO RUN AND FIND SOMEBODY TO LOVE
BUT ALL I NEEDED WAS SOME COCONUT OIL
1922 2018-10-30 19:44:31 Hours later, Prince Mohammed bounded into the gilded conference hall of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Riyadh to a standing ovation from scores of oil executives, #MbSvsISIS #MbSIsAMurderer
1923 2018-10-30 19:44:25 Use olive oil as a conditioner by leaving it warmed up on your hair for 15 minutes before shampoo.
1924 2018-10-30 19:44:20 Well they see him as a human right activist, like they see Deji and his cohorts, nothing special.
1925 2018-10-30 19:44:18 She must have got a whiff of Tarm & Hannibal by now & why is poor Nee’oil injured?
1926 2018-10-30 19:43:48 Been trading oil!
1927 2018-10-30 19:43:32 Two things women don’t do, get oil changes or update their apps. they’ll drive the whip until that bitch starting crip walking and let every single update come in and pull up and they wonder why Siri stuttering talk about “n-n-n-no s-s-s-s-storage” well well detective
1928 2018-10-30 19:43:26 You don’t live in Colorado so don’t speak about it. I lived there for 20 years. It’s an absolutely beautiful state that doesn’t need to be grabbed up by greedy oil industry assholes. #Renewables #ProtectTheWest
1929 2018-10-30 19:43:15 That would still be weed oil mate.
Saved me after a severe buss accident
1930 2018-10-30 19:43:09 The ultra wealthy always use celebrities to deceive people. Standard. That's why poor people stay poor because your Taylor swifts of the world sell them snake oil to appease the large corporations that make her hundreds of millions of dollars.
1931 2018-10-30 19:43:02 I don't need a whole restaurant, just a french fry stand. Potatoes cut however you want, dunk em in oil, throw on some salt, serve in a basket. That's it. No ketchup, nothing. Just basic fried potatoes with a little salt.
1932 2018-10-30 19:42:54 Du tycker det ja....vad vi andra tycker om dina blodspengar du tjänat på Lundin Oil kanske vi kan prata om istället?
1933 2018-10-30 19:42:54 It's mostly CBD oil. I use it for my back & life pain lol
1934 2018-10-30 19:42:51 Stakeholders and CEOs of the oil companies are accessory to the dooming of the future of our species
1935 2018-10-30 19:42:35 We will never be Norway. They have grown up leadership. Oil revenue used for reinvestment in infrastructure and to fund 2 start up funding programmes not frittering it away as tax cuts. They share rather than force the poor to endure austerity.

1937 2018-10-30 19:42:05 The perceived correlation between wheat and fert price baffles me.
Oil and gas can be hedged way further out than #wheat on @CMEGroup futures, and is traded x10 the volume of #wheat. The fert boys must cross trade the two #winnerwinner
1938 2018-10-30 19:42:04 i have a B+ as my midterm grade even after my teacher sent out an email he was concerned for my grade. im just like bro now im confused
1939 2018-10-30 19:41:57 Because the government took over the oil production the infrastructure is crumbling.  Now they are in debt and people are starving and fleeing the country.  Get the facts before speaking
1940 2018-10-30 19:41:50 And it will have a rippling impact worldwide, given that Saudi Arabia is  the world’s largest oil exporter and the largest reservoir for future  oil supplies. Dozens of countries depend on it for energy and fuel. #MbSvsISIS #MbSIsAMurderer
1941 2018-10-30 19:41:48 I first take the steps to prepare the salmon by seasoning & spreading olive oil. Then I make sure the grill has the right amount of heat. While cooking, I carefully observe that it’s browning and flaking properly, not overdoing it. If it looks done? Bon appetit.
1942 2018-10-30 19:41:35 Only after Chinese exclusion acts were passed if not mistaken. Proir the law was sketchy and even though Chinese were not resident aliens in the sense we understand it today, they had tacit approval to reside in country
1943 2018-10-30 19:41:29 When coal from kitui, gas from lamu and oil from Turkana come on stream what barren argument can people still have . For a long time a skewed perspective about productivity has been espoused which became the dominant and always the only  view in all Gov docs n policy propositions
1944 2018-10-30 19:41:20 What more can they gain since oil can be found almost in every country..I'm weeping for  future generations of nigeria.which way Nigeria?
1945 2018-10-30 19:41:20 How about oil?
1946 2018-10-30 19:41:19 I’ve only ever been suggested coconut oil and a lotion (don’t remember what it’s called) but it’s my scalp spreading to my forehead and face
1947 2018-10-30 19:41:18 You have to wear a fire suit to sit in a mock up?  Good luck this year.
1948 2018-10-30 19:41:15 We hear you. This is a really important issue and we’ve been driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years.  We’re on track to meet our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.
1949 2018-10-30 19:40:58 しまりん早くおねんねしないと犯すよ
1950 2018-10-30 19:40:43 Great name! It's a shame M&S are using Palm Oil/Fat in their sandwiches, sustainable or otherwise. I'll be steering clear of my fave Xmas sandwich :(
1951 2018-10-30 19:40:42 lol. I'm sure there's a third type of nigga. The one who grabs the ass without an intention to draw oil
1952 2018-10-30 19:40:36 Glad I am going to Oil Council VIP dinner no problems with anyone based on success really think #121events need to change modern apartheid

1955 2018-10-30 19:40:26 I’m 6 minutes into salt fat acid heat, I just witnessed Samin Nosrat drink from a wine glass of freshly pressed olive oil and I must make her my wife
1956 2018-10-30 19:40:09 ぼくに言わせればワセリンすら食用だよ。
1957 2018-10-30 19:39:59 Your family was absolute correct ... It’s those freaking manufacturers conning prop,e with their crap.. I’m LCHF eating grass fed meat, free range eggs, hard cheese, good healthy fat/oil and I’m as healthy as at 63.. I don’t believe their crap..
1958 2018-10-30 19:39:55 Essential oil diffuser 
1959 2018-10-30 19:39:44 actually palm oil is better you need to taste it
1960 2018-10-30 19:39:22 oil change and servicing
1961 2018-10-30 19:39:16 The improvement in soybean production has made a notable contribution in term of import-substitution. SA soybean oil cake imports have declined from nearly a million tonnes in 2010 to an estimated 480 000 tonnes this year.
1962 2018-10-30 19:39:14 Gurl... I haven't eaten KFC or Popeyes in 20 years. I lost 60 lbs the 1st 6 months... no sugar or fats/oil/butter at ALL... But the weight will FALL OFF, while I actually still DREAM about fried chicken and cigs...  LOL.
1963 2018-10-30 19:39:11 And that would be what?Not seeing it in wages, inflation taking any small increase to those actually receiving increases.Higher oil prices, stock market lost any gains it saw. Hate crimes up, division up, US loses raking. You have a very low opinion of what this country is about
1964 2018-10-30 19:39:04 Use coconut oil on your face. I’m 27 and look 18 lmao and drink 5 water bottles a day. We out here
1965 2018-10-30 19:39:01 Kimmel's was far, far worse and meant to offend. Have long stopped paying attention to Kelly, but context was also Halloween...so, boil in oil? Too good. Hang out to dry in spite of apology, fire and pay massive amount in severance-uh, makes sense....
1966 2018-10-30 19:38:59 OH' IS THAT ALL THE WORDS YOU CAN COME UP WITH !!!
LET ME TEACH YOU SOME ....

1967 2018-10-30 19:38:43 he was so hip that instead of lube he made me put jojoba oil on his dick with a dropper from a glass bottle. I can’t make this shit up.
1968 2018-10-30 19:38:15 It’s this stuff called basic instict. It’s a roll on oil that turns into a perfume that’s created by our pheromones so each everyone will smell different it’s a sex attractant 
1969 2018-10-30 19:38:05 Stare decisis applies here in Plyler but as with Rowe v. Wade the decision rests on shaky ground constitutionally
1970 2018-10-30 19:38:05 We don’t like waste in this household 

Roasted pumpkin seeds in olive oil, cayenne pepper and chilli  

So delicious and contains lots of omega 3 and 6 fatty acids which help with eye health and brain function
1971 2018-10-30 19:37:54 Keeps it moisturized honestly. I’m not saying it’s the best oil for me because I’d be lying but i wouldn’t say it doesn’t help my hair at all 
1972 2018-10-30 19:37:44 We can be completely self sufficient if we make a decision to do so.
The ability to process Oil Sands crude is at the top of the list
1973 2018-10-30 19:37:23 nan rubbed oil in my hair, new hair farzan who dis
1974 2018-10-30 19:37:16 He looks like the snake oil salesman that is realizing the town is ready to come after him to tar and feather him and run him out of town!    Trumpgate!
1975 2018-10-30 19:37:11 I'm such a big fan of hash browns, I adore every aspect of them, their crispiness, fluffiness, the fatty oil, the calories, and I love Meat Liquor. But together, it feels wrong to me Mollie. It feels wrong.
1976 2018-10-30 19:37:00 About Yemen,the Saudis used both oil and $ to muted Western leaders mouth .They can gather themselves within a minute if it was IRAn .They knew how to Linking themselves to hold a meeting.Hopeless and heartless people.Look@the Issue Of Jamal kashoggi they only revoked visa
1977 2018-10-30 19:36:54 I don’t know the density of cannabis oil, but if we assume twice water, that would be 2lb/pt or 9.3 pints, nearly a gallon injected for a toxic dose.

I think “effectively no lethal dose” is pretty accurate.
1978 2018-10-30 19:36:50 Is this oil extracted from it, or meant to be put on it?
1979 2018-10-30 19:36:43 And Thanksgiving dinner is just around the corner.
1980 2018-10-30 19:36:42 Also, if I remember correctly, a partially used item will still count as one of those items. Like there's 3 uses from one Snake Oil bottle, which means you'll have 2 full ones and 1 with 2 uses left which count as your 3x Snake Oil.... Which further complicates things.
1981 2018-10-30 19:36:41 Part of Trump "administration": check. Ethical troubles the subject of a PBS News Hour report on 10/19/18: check. Increasingly opened federal lands for oil, gas & mineral exploration & extraction: check

Face facts, he's there to profit, not to serve as Secretary of the Interior
1982 2018-10-30 19:36:27 No what would be brilliant would be to use oil revenues to create a true modern welfare state where orphans in Najaf and Karbala can live a decent life with real prospects.
1983 2018-10-30 19:36:27 >Gets oil changed, employee notices my Rasis keychain
"What anime is that from"
>Gets gas immediately afterwards, overheads attendants
"So I got the body pillow with both sides, but I'm going to keep the character a surprise"

jfc I live in Neo Otaku City and my life is an anime
1984 2018-10-30 19:36:23 Corporate media throughout the world is built on big food fueling big pharma while big oil gets away with blaming pollution on ... cows.
1985 2018-10-30 19:36:21 Oil producers fear the return of the big bad in the market.
1986 2018-10-30 19:36:17 We are going to need oil and gas for While yet unfortunately. How many people have electric central heating that you know?
1987 2018-10-30 19:36:17 Just doing the monthly fill on it. We fill fuel, def and change oil......it's good for next 300 hours. Fuel cap is a pain because it seizes on from a lack of use! 
1988 2018-10-30 19:36:08 This yè guy has struck oil with that song 
1989 2018-10-30 19:36:05 also!! you know what oil is bad for you!! Jamaican black castor oil
1990 2018-10-30 19:36:03 @realDonaldTrump My criticism of the US Department of State was not bad, see how shamelessly they talk about impunity, they constantly said that we would bring Iran's oil exports to zero, see how they deceived the people, I told the truth to the people,
1991 2018-10-30 19:36:00 Commodity update:
Gold: -0.63%
Silver: -0.97%
WTI crude: -1.13%
Brent oil: -1.63%
1992 2018-10-30 19:35:49 We were supposed to hold census in 2016 according to the 1999 Constitution but Buhari said there's no money although he wasted $1 billion looking for oil in Northern Nigeria.

If he wins a second term next year so we won't do census till 2023? Sad.
1993 2018-10-30 19:35:49 I don't think crude oil (wti) can even see 80
1994 2018-10-30 19:35:44 Dude i lost my ring. Sylvesters mom or grandma got it for me. I hope its at home. I never take it off hut i put oil on my hair for the frizziness so o think it slipped off. 
1995 2018-10-30 19:35:42 Where do they sell baby oil and booty rubs? I want to buy.
1996 2018-10-30 19:35:42 All the Dem know how to max out a credit card. What they don’t know how to do is pay the bill when it shows up. Which is exactly what happen to Venezuela. All that oil but their socialist Prez doesn’t know how to stick it in a bbl and sell it. Vote for Rohrabacher. @TomiLahren
1997 2018-10-30 19:35:37 Scary.
Returning to Vietnam from a 2 week leave at home my 1st plane was a 2 engine turboprop. Took off in dense fog. Once airborne engine vibration was so bad I thought I would be injured. Engines had oil steaks. Inside the plane was like an old car. Parts loose and hanging.
1998 2018-10-30 19:35:30 Fellas, is Earth sauce oil or water???  @KennedyLavender
1999 2018-10-30 19:35:30 And by the way, this class of enterpreneurship is far away from us: no property rights, our government still has exclusive rights to the rails and to the steel and to the oil.
Unless the government creates incentives and “enabling environment,” our entrepreneurs won’t do much.
2000 2018-10-30 19:35:28 You know that's to the USA right?!?!  Our Oil-By-Rail to BC (Foreign Markets) has been reduced 5 times since Notley took power.  Your apparently supporting this?!?!
2001 2018-10-30 19:35:19 Hydrogen is very unreliable as fuel . Will not pass . This is oil tycoons pushing for another expensive resource that they can control . You can’t build your fueling station at home
2002 2018-10-30 19:35:18 Crazy story: If oil companies didn't suppress the tech for the last few decades...we would have that now ...or at least very soon. But hey....can't do anything immediatly so let's not try to change then eh? Hope your kids enjoy asthma and COPD along with all the other lung issues
2003 2018-10-30 19:35:18 Activator oil cannot help you bro you’re 30 already
2004 2018-10-30 19:35:10 There's a max number of items you can hold for EACH item. e.g.: 3x Snake Oil, 3x Horse Reviver, 5x Animal Fat, etc...
2005 2018-10-30 19:35:07 And starving their people while they practically give away their oil to China.
2006 2018-10-30 19:34:56 She literally forgets to feed and change him, literally left him alone in the house with a pan of oil on forgetting where she left him a nanny isn’t gonna be taking care of seb 24/7 ross will need to work nanny needs breaks, she gets irrational when he cries and can’t hassle him
2007 2018-10-30 19:34:36 Too late again
Where the guy wey dey sell beard activator oil
2008 2018-10-30 19:34:33 Aw shit not gone lie all I read was oil change
2009 2018-10-30 19:34:32 Yeah I’ve tried all that before so think I might just tea tree oil it and apply a hot flannel to try and get the swelling down and then take it out. The piercing directly underneath it and my conch and everything are always fine it’s legit just that one it’s weird
2010 2018-10-30 19:34:26 The idea that the Nordic diet is low fat is so crazy. My grand parents ate head cheese, full fat cheese and butter - they had never heard of rape seed oil... and hearing and salmon isn't exactly low fat either.
2011 2018-10-30 19:34:13 Of course! But I’m trying to wrap my head around why there is negative Tesla news.  Who wouldn’t want a safer car and cleaner air? The only thing I can assume is either oil investors or car companies are paying for neg news in an attempt to take Tesla down or slow them down.
2012 2018-10-30 19:33:58 Cannabis oil for treatment is subject to strict licencing rules despite proof it can work. Big Pharma makes millions from drugs, several of them don't work,but they make money. It's as if Govt prefer the latter.
2013 2018-10-30 19:33:53 Miss Jessie’s Coily Custard, Shea Butter, Water, Coconut Oil
2014 2018-10-30 19:33:50 Nope,oil companies make lots of money by building and exploiting the heavily subsidised windfarms and fueling the power plants that deliver the real bulk of power. Windmills are save subsidised by tax investments for their owners ,they get money even if the energy is not needed.
2015 2018-10-30 19:33:48 Need an oil change and new tires. I’m tired of having a car
2016 2018-10-30 19:33:38 Aap na beard oil bechna ha?
2017 2018-10-30 19:33:36 Seems like I have been seeing these stories for years now but oil continues to trade in a relatively small range.
2018 2018-10-30 19:33:30 As noted no Scotus case has ever addressed this. The case mentioned, and cited , Plyler v. Doe had a non binding footnote. The article fails to mention this key point.
Plyler itself was decided bcse largely no compelling govt interest was shown at the time.
2019 2018-10-30 19:33:18 I feel the sardine has little oil in it already so i pour it away most times
2020 2018-10-30 19:33:16 I don't think we need to debunk all complex information. But if there's a way to report images for pornography, hate speech, and harassment/bullying, is there a way to report images for peddling snake oil (like essential oils that cure cancer or ions for improving balance)?
2021 2018-10-30 19:32:58 Good day  , this is a good  time from our client and our  patron . 
       A prominent Nigerian billionaire who dead recently  but there family whant to sell the  Oil well pls  we need  reliable buyer  urgently .

2024 2018-10-30 19:32:22 うぉー！そうか！ロキさんがいるじゃないですか(^^)職場知識ありがとうございます
2025 2018-10-30 19:32:14 I kept doing seasalt soaks with mine & went back to the piercer & she just said put teatree oil on it twice a day for 2 days & then 2 days with nothing & then repeat but that didn’t do anything so I just made sure it was clean and took it out & kept cleaning it until it healed
2026 2018-10-30 19:32:02 We were prepared to make the max donation, but just saw the racist comments by voice of the Democratic Party, Hilary Clinton.  Sorry.  Maybe next time.
2027 2018-10-30 19:31:48 Beauty companies, placebo diet pills and snake oil salesmen CREATE and PROMOTE a mass societal deficiency of female self esteem so they can SELL you a solution to their manufactured problems. Remember: they’ll mock your body positivity because they can’t capitalize on that. 
2028 2018-10-30 19:31:41 just because big oil is trash doesn’t mean you aren’t a shit person
2029 2018-10-30 19:31:38 I could totally have been a snake oil salesman in the old west.

2030 2018-10-30 19:31:37 GOD HELP US - one more Trumper who cares less about the people and is all about corp welfare, big oil, and the 1%
2031 2018-10-30 19:31:35 Sorry, not exactly sure what you're saying, but I think it's that solar panels produce toxic waste. So does fission. However, coal, oil and gas produce toxic and radioactive waste as well. I don't know the exact numbers and it sounds like you don't either. Further research req'd
2032 2018-10-30 19:31:35 Make more than one. I'm sorry if its more work. I genuinely appreciate you calling out these snake oil dealers.
2033 2018-10-30 19:31:32 Essential Oil lovers LOVE calling essential oils “powerful plant juices”
2034 2018-10-30 19:31:22 739,795 at last count. Every one of them a huge fan of getting $1600/yr. from oil rights.
And every one of them a huge fan of receiving a lot more.
And this is a hugely conservative state.
2035 2018-10-30 19:31:20 Oh, I have that too. Bought it when I got the coffee. I just don't have frying oil at the moment. Need to go to the store.
2036 2018-10-30 19:31:12 Oil prices down more than 1 percent on rising supply, trade war
2037 2018-10-30 19:31:08 We don’t need the long preamble, bro. Just advertise the CBD oil next time...
2038 2018-10-30 19:30:48 Procaryotes survive in space protected by their oil drop inside rock sedimented over it? Algae have no such possibility
2039 2018-10-30 19:30:46 Combine 9 tsps chimichanga with 2 1/2 pints Rice. Mix into  Olive Oil. Drain. Serve the next morning for breakfast.

2044 2018-10-30 19:30:17 Why put a tap on main oil line dangerous
2045 2018-10-30 19:30:15 Gonna overdose on some zinc and fish oil 
2046 2018-10-30 19:30:15 Why are you paying 75 dollars for an oil change??
2047 2018-10-30 19:30:02 Never bought in to MBS as reforms. Saw it all a PR. his fear of oil coming to an end and trying to turn SA in to a tourist destination.  Knowing of the huge project going on for entertainment park in the south. So the WWE deal was just another piece of this puzzle.
2048 2018-10-30 19:29:27 LOL yes bria i’m aware of this but it still doesn’t do it for ME lol!! i’m not a fan, i like jojoba oil and argan oil!

Like name of it and how it's works ?
2057 2018-10-30 19:28:31 Figured out how you're going to fill your £13bn deficit if you leave the UK
Oil brings in less than a wee krankie Sturgeon give away in free prescriptions and uni places.

So how you going to pay for indie, or are you all going back to crofting
2058 2018-10-30 19:28:30 Next time buy fish oil supplements for him.
2059 2018-10-30 19:28:17 With the schmuck's responsible for the sudden demand for palm oil/palm fruit, the entire Orangutan species is at tiskbof being iped out. Last video I saw, there were baby orphan's left behind. Bastard's.
2060 2018-10-30 19:27:54 The headline makes it seem like he made some off the cuff comments, but if you read the article, this is about his actual views, which are conspiratorial and anti-Semitic. Looks like his daughter is not woke; she’s descent.
2061 2018-10-30 19:27:20 We refuse to grow gmo soya because of myths that it grows and mature in 1week, but scrample for cooking oil made from imported gmo soya or crude soya oil, whilst some are increasing profits by increasing yields and droping prices here we doing the opposite and we are outcompeted
2062 2018-10-30 19:27:19 Check out the destruction of palm oil in Papua New Guinea.
2063 2018-10-30 19:27:08 It has hemp seed oil but I call it weed lotion
2064 2018-10-30 19:27:07 That’s an unfair characterization. Oil isn’t the only thing that matters to Mr McConnaught and the UPC.

Natural gas, pulp and paper and beef cattle are also high on the priority list.
2065 2018-10-30 19:26:45 @ScottMStedman @Fraude_1 I got a kick out this, the guys got balls, ya gotta give him that. But why's he still selling snake oil is beyond me..
2066 2018-10-30 19:26:32 I advise y’all to never go to Kwik Kar for car maintenance other than oil changes.

Please check the environment of both pic, Jonathan was not inside the office, Buhari was inside the office and what do you expect him to do inside the office? Eat, drink or party? If not to treat documents

Whale oil beef hooked.
2076 2018-10-30 19:25:14 Sounds delicious - I really prefer nut cheese over the coconut oil/soya versions (my other completely disagrees!) @nush_foods cheese spread is really good if you haven't tried it
2077 2018-10-30 19:25:01 Hi Ken, There are guidelines for EVOO. They have been in existence for years courtesy of the International Olive Council. Now, there are also guidelines in the U.S. thanks to the efforts of the California Olive Oil Council.
2078 2018-10-30 19:24:53 Yes often, but I have a set of tried and tested 'tools' for everything emotional. EFT, Reiki, meditation and CBD oil...quite a potent combo!

2080 2018-10-30 19:24:37 My condo is leaking water. My car is leaking oil. The government is leaking fascism. It's a bad time.

2082 2018-10-30 19:24:33 Kikikikikikiki, with sand it will ooo and olive oil. Anointed one
2083 2018-10-30 19:24:25 Only if you soak them in dirty oil from your tractor
2084 2018-10-30 19:24:10 Oil tax revenues were not particularly significant last year. Likely to be higher next year, but still nowhere near the level Alex Salmond and his SNP colleagues suggested (and relied upon) in their independence white paper.

Unionists warned it was volatile. They didn't listen.
2085 2018-10-30 19:24:06 Proof of the often repeated cliche: you get the government you deserve. These people keep voting for snake oil salesmen.
2086 2018-10-30 19:24:02 Vaping is another great way to use CBD Oil!
2087 2018-10-30 19:23:54 There’s a lot of major ports that don’t allow nuclear ships. That’s  one of the reason they’re still on oil. 

@Yossaaah May be able provide more info.
2088 2018-10-30 19:23:38 Not anymore. It’s old stock :( They stopped all their own hair range which I was bummed out about ‘cause I used the hair oil. Was only a £1 and worked brilliantly :(
2089 2018-10-30 19:23:36 2/2 Defund £Billions at home leaving children hungry & homeless dying in the streets.

Cut taxes for the rich.

Spend £Billions killing those in lands of oil, especially children (breaks their spirit). Then I have you wittering on.

Find someone to do your job to actually inform.
2090 2018-10-30 19:23:34 So I’ve walked into my aunties house and there’s anointing oil on the table. £100 says my cousin asked to go trick or treating 
2091 2018-10-30 19:23:31 Food companies that thrust Palm Oil in everything are a lot to blame.
@Congress should outlaw anything that comes from the Amazon Forest ..
We can grow food in the USA.  Saving our Wildlife should be a top Priority.
2092 2018-10-30 19:23:28 As a woman who knows about the basics of ins and out of a vehicle, I LOATHE walking into a shop. I came for an oil change (which I can do myself but I’m just lazy) and an inspection. But my temp gauge is temperamental and threw a check engine light. I already replaced the sensor
2093 2018-10-30 19:23:27 Hello parents, if you know it please teach ALL of your children about proper car maintenance beyond check your oil and change a spare. It feels shitty, esp as a woman, to go to a mechanic and say "my dad said to do _____?" and not know what you're asking for
2094 2018-10-30 19:23:25 If you like oil spills on the California coast @TheRealJohnHCox  is your man.
2095 2018-10-30 19:23:10 So apparently it's a bad idea to get arrested as a law student.  

The California Bar sees civil disobedience as a negative mark on your moral character, but working for a corporate law firm that represents oil companies is fine.
2096 2018-10-30 19:23:10 Mine smell boiling oil

2098 2018-10-30 19:23:05 If you cook it this way, the egusi won't cook long enough and if it doesn't cook long enough, it can cause food poisoning. You need to allow the egusi cook for long before adding oil and vegetables.
2099 2018-10-30 19:22:46 U.S. Halts Plan to Drill in Eastern GulfOct1, 2010WASHINGTON Obama administration announced on Wednesday that it had rescinded its decision to expand offshore oil exploration into the eastern Gulf of Mexico and along the Atlantic Coast because of weaknesses in federal regulation
2100 2018-10-30 19:22:40 @freshfmibadan #Dothernews I thought by now Mr integrity the petroleum minister could've tackle the menace in the oil sector but the reverse is the case. As a matter of fact there's a monumental corruption going on in that sector as we speak.
2101 2018-10-30 19:22:33 I think I'm using too much coconut oil. Peeped on my pee and there was oil! 
2102 2018-10-30 19:22:29 Gotta go get my oil changed tomorrow can’t miss my free oil change
2103 2018-10-30 19:22:23 Even if the story was a legit one, what prevents this champ from pursuing her passion of oil selling ?

2107 2018-10-30 19:22:03 Can’t stand doing this in the summer but the Vaseline / coconut oil on your feet under socks all night makes your feet sooooo silky. It is time.
2108 2018-10-30 19:21:57 Theres so this this one ever will go back to side with the content of the oil and devastating.
2109 2018-10-30 19:21:42 Great Canadian Oil Change. You just drive up and go in and done in 10 minutes.

2111 2018-10-30 19:21:36 My mom once tried to tell me coconut oil was the answer to everything 
2112 2018-10-30 19:21:36 Finally getting my oil change tomorrow lol
2113 2018-10-30 19:21:21 Brand: Argan Oil 
Product: Hydrating Hair Mask

Find it in any Afro-Asian Hair Shop. Or save the pic and just show it to them. It’s about £2 cheaper than stuff I’ve used before that didn’t produce same results. Surprising.
2114 2018-10-30 19:21:21 I use distillate oil that's a combo of CBD and THC. I ingest a small drop before bed every night and found keeping a vape pen of the oil handy to use during the day as needed helps. One or two puffs works as well as a rescue inhaler but without the jittery side effects.
2115 2018-10-30 19:21:12 1k followers with 118 following...... Celebrity crush 

but at least follow back those that followed you, it will remove nothing dear
2116 2018-10-30 19:21:11 coconut oil is the most useless oil out there.
2117 2018-10-30 19:21:04 Oh I know that, get rid of free prescriptions and pay uni fees and it will soon disappear
£1bn cost for prescriptions
£1.8bn for universities 
That's double the revenue from oil

2119 2018-10-30 19:20:52 Thank you Kara Swisher !!  Thank you for eliminating not only Hilary Clinton from the public stage going forward, but you also likely doomed your sanctimonious self as well.  Well done !!  @cnbc @RealJamesWoods
2120 2018-10-30 19:20:34 it's also hard to figure out when you couple it with the rise in renewables.

But in general, people today continue to look for oil and destroy the planet when other alternatives are cheaper and safer, so common sense and rationality just go out the window anyways
2121 2018-10-30 19:20:26 I'm a big LCHF diet fan having reversed my type 2 diabetes with it - but keto and paleo are non-scientific bullshit and Gary Taubes is a non-scientific snake oil salesman (the snake oil is his books). Writing a book is not how you advance science - not since the 1900s.
2122 2018-10-30 19:20:15 Does anyone get to leave from an oil change with just getting an oil change? 
2123 2018-10-30 19:19:48 White woman with psoriasis here. I am a Connoisseur of Moisturizer, lol. Lotions and oils are serious matters to me. Shea butter, coconut oil, olive oil, glycerin. Sadly, no matter how much of these things I use, there’s no cure. But, I get ya.
2124 2018-10-30 19:19:45 I own an Alberta Oil & Gas company. Supporting Kenney will cost Albertans billions. The CONS have cost my company & will continue to cost you jobs. They are supported by foreign subsidiary companies to send oil cheaply to the USA refineries. 10yrs in Power & no pipelines E or W

2127 2018-10-30 19:19:10 Whats your problem, then? Do you even have the slightest clue what a hypodermic top is, look what happened to oil in 2008

2135 2018-10-30 19:17:58 Please make sure to research the drugs you buy. There is a big problem right now with illegal THC Oil production (Wax Cartridges) and some of these cartridges are straight poison to your body containing pesticides and other chemicals that can harm your body. BUY LAB TESTED CARTS!
2136 2018-10-30 19:17:56 @chrislhayes this one was brilliant . Data is the new oil and gas , how this political polarization started with @BarackObama becoming president of the United States and the the pit bull politics . It was too dope my best podcast #withpod
2137 2018-10-30 19:17:53 The measure would cause immense damage to Colorado’s economy well beyond the energy industry. According to the nonpartisan Common Sense Policy Roundtable, 77 percent of the nearly 150,000 jobs that the measure would eliminate would be outside of the natural gas and oil industry.

Let us stop insulting our president,let's support him.

2144 2018-10-30 19:17:31 You mean an islamic product that adresses a global need like gas and oil, Sir?
2145 2018-10-30 19:17:30 The only people that would buy that flavor would never be sated with such a puny little carton. You should sell it in an oil drum.
2146 2018-10-30 19:17:29 They may be taking oil from your property without you knowing it. A drill can drill 8 miles horizontally.
2147 2018-10-30 19:17:29 This "Sbusiso" guy is cheating with everyone. He needs a serious anointing oil. #UthandoNoxolo
2148 2018-10-30 19:17:12 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
2149 2018-10-30 19:16:59 Seriously, I'm a virgin! Where do you think they get virgin olive oil?
2150 2018-10-30 19:16:31 Yes, at one time the Republicans were also concerned about clean air and water.  Today Republicans in Congress, IMO, are more concerned about getting donations from industries primarily responsible for pollution.  Mainly the coal and oil industries.

2155 2018-10-30 19:14:50 ねー
2156 2018-10-30 19:14:44 Yeah but it ruins the joke if I say we don't have oil except in certain areas
2157 2018-10-30 19:14:42 FWIW the only things on that tray that could possible come from a GMO are the sugar in the soda & the nugget sauce, and *maybe* the oil the fries were cooked in if @Wendys uses canola.
2158 2018-10-30 19:14:37 going from my impala to this Mercedes aint no hoe..I just looked at this man so dumb when he told me the oil change price.

2162 2018-10-30 19:14:07 Reasons to be bullish into year end:  (aside from any softening in China or from the Fed:  
Real rates still ridiculously low.  
Oil is still low.  Not inflation threat -- YET
Buybacks about to restart
Midterms imminent expect buying after
Year end chase - FOMO
Economy sound.
2163 2018-10-30 19:13:57 lots of finger dents in the thin dough so it holds olive oil and the wee bits when you roll it up, think hot fresh thin crust pizza

2173 2018-10-30 19:12:38 And no Russian election hacking to illegitimately push into the WH an illiterate snake oil salesman.
2174 2018-10-30 19:12:28 Have you looked into the research on using heavy creams, alt-creams (like coconut), MCT Oil & even butter ... as subs for milk, half-&-half and sugar in your joe? Anecdotally, I find it has appetite suppressant qualities and kinda interesting taste qualities.
2175 2018-10-30 19:12:21 Cooking oil or engine oil?
2176 2018-10-30 19:12:20 "...The company turns the oil into a colorless, odorless, tasteless powder" ...that isn't a chemical at all 
2177 2018-10-30 19:12:20 No seriously do I need to start bring my oil to work with me? My stomach is itching like crazy.
2178 2018-10-30 19:12:19 That is the only way TO make it. If the mayo bothers you, switch to Kraft olive oil mayo. Low fat and low sat fat.

2183 2018-10-30 19:11:52 with oil in 70's and natural gas breaking out?  amazing!
2184 2018-10-30 19:11:40 Eat a tablespoon or two of pure fat, like butter or coconut oil.

2186 2018-10-30 19:11:17 Democrats like Venezuela?Please.Anyone with a working BRAIN knows Obama signed the executive order labeling Venezuela a security risk for the US. So DID YOU. Why? Because Venezuela has the WORLD LARGEST OIL RESERVE and the US wants it. Your LIE shows YOUR concern about midterms.
2187 2018-10-30 19:11:17 The world is polluted because us and the oil that we use, think about that when you drive
2188 2018-10-30 19:11:08 As mohammed camel umbaro
I remember looking at the oil in the ground and seeing displeasure in my countrymens eyes.i told them that day that crops may not grow here but i will make something that has a need for oil and therefore make you wealthy from your boon of life
2189 2018-10-30 19:11:06 I hope so.  Haven’t seen sanction fears yet.  Oil on water dropped around 60mb the last few weeks and floating storage is in multi year lows with no Iran buildup yet.  All indications except pricing this is going to get tight real tight.
2190 2018-10-30 19:11:02 What kinda oil are we talking about here.???
2191 2018-10-30 19:10:57 According to a Reuters poll. In the US, crude oil inventories are expected to rise by 3.67 million bbl,

2194 2018-10-30 19:10:35 Where you go for an oil change?
2195 2018-10-30 19:10:31 I had to put in an RTO for next Friday and use my vacation time because I have to get an oil change. I’m pissed.
2196 2018-10-30 19:10:25 I ordered and received some MCT oil to try in my coffee. 1 tbsp in my coffee and an hour later had one heck of an energy boost. Went did a power a power walk about 30 mins and hardly broke a sweat. Help a bit, but still feel full of energy. Wow!
2197 2018-10-30 19:10:03 サラダ油って体に悪いんですか？サラダなのに？
2198 2018-10-30 19:09:45 Yep. Maga...barf... He probably got all tingly when trump was talking about taking oil from other countries and bombing families. Winning. In trade, both parties need to get something valuable. Sigh.
2199 2018-10-30 19:09:44 Nuh, my head is already whirling bcz of oil fumes in the paint kitchen. Tomorrow perhaps in good light.
2200 2018-10-30 19:09:34 idk how to explain it but it's coconut milk-based with chili oil, kinda like curry
2201 2018-10-30 19:09:29 Don't let your oil trip you  
2202 2018-10-30 19:09:13 US equities rose, the S&P500 currently up 0.8%, while key commodities oil and copper fell amid US-China trade concerns. The US dollar benefitted from disappointing Eurozone data and a Brexit warning from S&P. Given all that, AUD and NZD performed well.
2203 2018-10-30 19:08:57 italians MUST sweat olive oil. i’m convinced.
2204 2018-10-30 19:08:55 these braids got my scalp itching so darn bad!!!! i can’t wait to get home and oil it

2208 2018-10-30 19:08:19 He exempted Florida, Mar-a-lago- his investment, from off shore drilling. All other states w/ sea coastlines R subject to off-shore drillling, but not FL.He opened up national monument lands to gas & oil drilling. Lied re NYSE-- it opened 9/17, not day after 9/11,to justify rally
2209 2018-10-30 19:07:50 And, hidden away in #Budget2018, a possible £3bn tax break for oil & gas companies in the North Sea, yet another blank cheque for the dirty fossil fuel industry whilst clean, renewable energy is ignored...  #ToriesOut 
2210 2018-10-30 19:07:47 I often use the defence that a thief stole the heating oil to my family when they complain about lack of heat and basically it seems to work every time
2211 2018-10-30 19:07:42 نفت من كجاست؟ Where is my oil
2212 2018-10-30 19:07:42 Moscow - The city of contrasts. Avocado big, pineapple sweet, bilberry jumbo (small box), hemp oil (small bottle) can easily cost $10 per each. At the same time, local Internet provider, started to offer symmetric unlimited 250 Mbps channel for $10 per month. Evidently upgrading!
2213 2018-10-30 19:07:38 Marijuana is illegal because of its  cousin. Hemp has thousands of uses.Cannabis from hemp would cripple the, Pharma, cotton, wood, oil, plastics,  vitamin, health food, body care, textiles,industries. Cannabis is only dangerous to big business that pollute, poison and kill us.

2215 2018-10-30 19:07:37 Good, they should also ensure we don't have a repeat of the notorious December-January scarcity.... I am sure those greedy oil marketers are strategizing as we speak.
2216 2018-10-30 19:07:36 Long-only energy fund pm says as of yesterday worst month in ~5yr running fund, so worse than any month of ‘15/16 oil crash.
2217 2018-10-30 19:07:18 I thought I was the only one who noticed. Funny enough there are always workers around nikipita. Up to now you can't even tell what the hell they are doing. Expanding the road or looking for oil?

2232 2018-10-30 19:04:04 It works quite well! I think it has so many uses because it has super simple ingredients (water, coconut oil, essential oils) nothing too crazy

2237 2018-10-30 19:03:20 We went into it, what- 1 mil votes down? But, again, I have never seen anything like this, Yes, we have red hat coalition, but we also have Rex Tillerson types. Just got a text from Lubbock-everyone they know is voting Beto. LUBBOCK. Oil country. That's CRAZY. It's still tight.

1) The post 911 response was mainly motivated by oil.

2) Trump has an conspiratorial relationship with Russia (im guessing 1/4 true, if at all).

2276 2018-10-30 18:58:16 Colorado ranks No. 6 in the country in both oil and natural gas production. 

That means a lot of jobs & taxes collected, but the left would rather throw all of it away by banning drilling on 95% of the land in the state.

2282 2018-10-30 18:58:01 That’s fine Colorado sucks. We will get oil from North Dakota. Jack up the gas prices for states that want all the perks of gas and oil but none of the burden.
2283 2018-10-30 18:57:52 Have done
If his method is
State oil = 1
Joe the plumber = 1
 Then ok maybe 70% private
But if it's % of GDP then it's 85-90% nationalised.

Otherwise why the hyper inflation of 1m%. You only get that by printing money you can't back up.

2298 2018-10-30 18:56:26 @hmeisler Reminds me of the CONgressional hearings they held on "evil oil speculators" years ago when oil was over $100bbl.   It only matters when the price action is "bad"

2306 2018-10-30 18:55:28 So we still have 50% NOx emissions and billions of tonnes of CO2 that is the true nature of what is being claimed. Could develop Hydrogen from clean means Stop the £10 Million per day subsidies to Oil and Gas and subsidies Clean fuel
2307 2018-10-30 18:55:15 I don't think voters want that. Why shd they pay 2-3 times as much for "renewable" fuel sources. It's not that important cuz US is oil rich.
2308 2018-10-30 18:55:12 70% of what because if it's revenue then he's wrong, if it's just a straight count of number of businesses then counting a one man plumbing business the same as the state oil company then maybe, but on a GDP percentage it's north of 85%
Even food distribution is nationalised
2309 2018-10-30 18:55:08 Charles as a fan of both the show and market knowledge I watched the ask Payne segment. Where it came to OIL I remain confused. If Millions MORE people are traveling to work, factories are booming and Trumps begging OPEC to produce MORE oil how can we have a surplus?? @cvpayne
2310 2018-10-30 18:55:06 Limit changes happen every 6 months @CMEGroup. Here's the new set starting November 1. 

UNCHANGED
corn 25 cents
wheat 35 cents
oats 20 cents

CHANGED
soybeans 60 cents - was 75
bean meal $20/ton - was 25
bean oil 20 cent/lbs - was 25
2311 2018-10-30 18:55:04 Check your history: The U.S. had an oil embargo on Japan at the time because they had invaded the Dutch East Indies. Because of the oil embargo they had problems obtaining oil for their fleet and it was one of the deciding factors in going to war with the U.S..
2312 2018-10-30 18:54:51 And the shipping lane has it own path; the bird will naturally not flying around the oil rig; but we as a human can't build the rig in conservation area.

2314 2018-10-30 18:54:38 Honey you need to counter inflammation! Turmeric, oregano oil, ibuprofen.
2315 2018-10-30 18:54:38 More pressure on the Corporations that use Palm Oil ! we have to save the Rain Forest, its the Earth's lungs, not to mention the animals(some already endangered) & plant life for which only 3% has been studied for medical purposes.
2316 2018-10-30 18:54:25 If it weren’t for their oil (thanks J.P. Getty) they would still be living in tents. And the U.S. would be making them.
2317 2018-10-30 18:53:39  coconut oil

2318 2018-10-30 18:53:19 THE OIL INDUSTRY DOES NOT CARE....

THEY HAVE NEVER CARED...

IF YOU THINK THEY DO  

YOU ARE WRONG

2322 2018-10-30 18:53:02 Hahaha what human rights are you talking about? Did you know what happened in Abu Ghraib by US government? Do you know how many people were killed by the American government? Are you aware that ur government stole the oil in Iraq and Libya and simply walked away!
2323 2018-10-30 18:52:58 Since Ukraine's two biggest agrifood exports are sunflower oil and maize, doubt they care too much about the fate of lettuce.

BTW, the discussion is about the food market in the EU, not food imports to UK. (Ukraine is, of course, really really close to EU MS Poland.)

2326 2018-10-30 18:52:36 no i read it. but i dont care. see i worked in the oil industry with people who risked everything to get here and watch them work their asses off in the oil field for their families here and at home. key word is worked. i dont have the prejudices as other people. i see people
2327 2018-10-30 18:52:32 Oil companies never owned it. Kinder Morgan's a pipeline co, not an oil co. And they sold 'cos the politics increased the risk that they'd never get it built. FYI, in the immediate aftermath of the sale, KM shares traded down. Sharply.
2328 2018-10-30 18:52:27 ‘Grant’... like it’s a gift.

A company with billions (trillions from 1970) of dollars of oil & gas, billions in food & drink, billions in fisheries, billions in agri-produce... & a nation of only 5.5m people. 

Yup... we really need a handout from our net importing neighbour.
2329 2018-10-30 18:52:16 That's the old liberty bell oil building that was planned for the good truck venture before falling aside I think. Not sure if it's going to be demoed  after the recent fire.
2330 2018-10-30 18:52:11 Current mining ecosystem in Ex Katanga is dramatic! A huge, organised & massive looting!
Look what UAE, SaudiArabia have been able to reach as economic progress from Oil or Botswana from diamond... Katanga is not even @ 10% of the minimum development level it should have reached!
2331 2018-10-30 18:52:08 A lot of abandon project by past administration and is fixing so. When Nigeria was earning a lot of money in oil the people in ASO ROCK then what did they do with all that money. Let's face fact past administration let this county down when we could have grown
2332 2018-10-30 18:52:03 And I'm not sure the Democratic party wants to nationalize the oil industry and prop the entire economy up on top of it.

2342 2018-10-30 18:50:20 The Saudi's prove one thing . Most people care more about money than morals or human rights. Wahhabism is bad. They subjugate women , gays and non-Muslims and yet every US Admin. for decades have turned a blind eye. <($)> <($)> blinded by money and oil.

Threatened further tarrifs on the remaining $275bn of Chinese imports. If he can't reach an agreement with Xi Jinping next month then come December it's on.

04/11 sanctions on Iranian oil exports kick in...

A Savage!!!
2345 2018-10-30 18:50:09 Damn right. We’ve put the foot down on a second referendum, secured key scottish industries such as whisky, provided support for oil & has, the Cities growth deal, and an extra £950m for Holyrood spending whilst bringing the deficit down to a tenth the level we inherited from Lab
2346 2018-10-30 18:50:05 Hoping you know the answer here - read somewhere (& a while ago) that even if no oil was sold for transportation, that would eliminate only 1/3 of oil companies’ business, because petrochemicals are used in so many products.
True?
2347 2018-10-30 18:49:39 Some excellent news today- the Cornishman’s tumour has reduced in size thanks to a combination of Avastin/Lomustine +cannabis oil.

2355 2018-10-30 18:48:42 There is a big leadership role on the continent itself,if Nigeria huge population was educated it would have dominant the skill labour force of the continent
Nigeria would have use it oil and other resources to dominant the entire continent.

Over 2 Million Dead, 70 Million Refugees created, all in 17 years. The nearest thing to facts we know are that Uyghur Muslims are being imprisoned
2372 2018-10-30 18:46:45 There's a separate hell for those you wear your headphones while having oil in their hair... :X
2373 2018-10-30 18:46:35 Has someone anointed him with oil yet?  He really believes that he is Batman.  No wonder he is always looking for the witches.
2374 2018-10-30 18:46:32 Whats the price to import oil from Middle East? #TrudeauMustGo
2375 2018-10-30 18:46:07 Cos USA is bullying & arm-twisting it allies. Trump is bullying Japan making it buy costly arms, has threatened India with more tariffs & sanctions on its oil import prices hurting its economy badly.

US standing up to China is more about its economy & less to do with allies.

2377 2018-10-30 18:45:46 Το καλό με την εξαγορά του Alpha από τη Motor Oil είναι ότι ο Δήμος θα εμπλουτίσει τη γευστική παλλέτα του (σικ) γλείφοντας νέες κωλοτρυπίδες γιατί με του Κοντομηνά μόνο είχαν νεκρώσει οι γευστικοί του κάλυκες.
2378 2018-10-30 18:45:42 Gas & oil industries don’t even know where some of their pipes are laid! Keeping them 2500’ from citizens won’t stop them drilling. If anything it’ll give them an excuse to raise prices to increase profits.
2379 2018-10-30 18:45:40 Thanks Mark. Plenty of info. Seems like hydrogen getting push from oil and gas. Quelle surprise.
2380 2018-10-30 18:45:40 But we don’t have oil

2383 2018-10-30 18:45:24 not only is this shit weirdly cocky about chores, its also wrong.  you can use different weight oil and maybe someone will sell you some special wiper fluid but its hardly a requirement. dont you live in kelowna? one of the mellowest winter zones in canada
2384 2018-10-30 18:45:12 @Hyundai should be ashamed of its location in Hempstead NY. Blatant overcharging and I haven’t received my car back yet. Been here for 4 hours for an oil change. Had an appointment scheduled for 11 that I made last week.
2385 2018-10-30 18:45:04 It won't get sold. The oil companies already owned it for a fraction of what we paid for it.
If it was worthwhile they would have built it.
They know it is a loser, they will profit and we will pay.

2390 2018-10-30 18:44:45 I thought it was interesting to look at advertising and publicity compared to oil paintings. I’ve never really thought about paintings as a predecessor to advertisements, but Berger does a wonderful job of explaining the ties between the two.

This is acknowledging that sanction waivers are be possible.
2401 2018-10-30 18:43:37 Mr. Osinbanjo pls stop lying that the Buhari-led APC administration had the lowest oil revenue in the country’s history, osinbajo is being economical with the truth, it was OBJ that had the lowest of $22 per barrel.

What you’re doing is just corrupt, plane & simple. You’re an old white guy that isn’t progressive who doesn’t belong in office.
2430 2018-10-30 18:40:20 Also, remember that carbon taxes stay in the community/state/country. Whereas money spent on oil is often sent to distant countries.
Carbon tax revenue can be spent on buses, healthcare, or on reducing other taxes. A carbon tax doesn't remove money from a community.

You anoint my head with oil;

All the days of my life;
And I will dwell in the house of the LORD
Forever. In JESUS Name Amen.

2443 2018-10-30 18:38:29 Sanctions in Francoist Spain came from the UN/US entourage and were mostly diplomatic. In fact, Texaco supplied the oil to Franco during the Civil War. To give you an example, the French close their borders...for only 2 years

2445 2018-10-30 18:38:15 Leaving the world's oil in the ground is not going to happen. Punishing Canadians for virtue signalling points by taxing them for heating their homes while making no effect on the atmosphere's CO2 level may be ok with you but thankfully is not going to win any elections.

2457 2018-10-30 18:36:26 oil? *all.
2458 2018-10-30 18:36:19 And the corrupt government taking their land and giving it to the multinationals for palm oil plantations. Locking them out of their own land! And then gunning them down when they peacefully protest.
2459 2018-10-30 18:36:13 Why did big oil donate to this? You’re a fraud. #corporatehack
2460 2018-10-30 18:36:02 A UFC-style oil + mud grudge match would be cool. People would watch. It's a realistic pop-culture politics/entertainment level past spirited (but predictably boring) campaigning and debates. #GillumForGovernor #DeSantisForGovernor
2461 2018-10-30 18:36:01 As I was gently gliding warm stones over my clients face,  (Never knowing what essential oil one might get a whiff of here) he said, "oh that smells good, what is it?" My reply, "it's my altoid!" We both got a good laugh on that one!

2463 2018-10-30 18:35:50 People are destroying earth,  oil is because of humans, humans create that shit right?  So humans must help to clean, I'm very proud of seeing that someone is badass enough to do something about it, cuz earth is home and the truth is that hurting earth we are hurting ourselves
2464 2018-10-30 18:35:49 Seriously, do yall use shortening or vegetable oil when getting the flour ready?

2466 2018-10-30 18:35:34 I don’t see any justification for supporting the KSA in what amounts to a imbecilic attempt to exterminate a Yemanl ethnic minority. It’s alleged that Iran backs the rebels that took Sana’a. So what? They lack the means to threaten the KSA oilfields or the flow of oil.

2475 2018-10-30 18:34:51 1) try telling Albertans that where those numbers are much higher, 2) I was speaking of our daily use of oil regardless it’s origin. The economic system is entirely dependent upon it and that needs to change.
2476 2018-10-30 18:34:41 Yes ma'am it's the one that I have been using since March! I have had great results! Why are you looking at trying CBD Oil?

2482 2018-10-30 18:33:29 I agree. The "ethical oil" argument underestimates oilsands opponents capacity for hypocrisy.

It still has a place for persuading the open-minded, though.

2484 2018-10-30 18:33:12 We could use oil made from seeds from mustard plants.
2485 2018-10-30 18:33:08 Black licorice (naturally made) is actually healthy in moderate amounts. The anise oil in it has certain health benefits.

2507 2018-10-30 18:30:17 Congratulations madam. 
Market is very much down from last few months because of oil and rupee factor. Both r now recovering. The state election result will be the first catalyst and then Central elections.
It looks like 2019 will be the best year for stock market.
2508 2018-10-30 18:30:08 @JustinTrudeau I really, really, *really* hope theses stories of Canadian oil companies being linked to Brazilian oil do not become reality. You’re progressive in many ways but your climate action is anything but. Do what’s right for the children.

2510 2018-10-30 18:29:57 There's an essential oil which they hate the smell of. A drop or two will suffice. Google knows...

Also, it helps to not leave Weetabix in one's pockets.
2511 2018-10-30 18:29:50 As we said before, a good director can make not so good movies and a not typically showy cinematographer can make something beautiful. I will say that what I have seen is gorgeous, especially the shots of the monsters; reminds me of oil paintings depicting various biblical events

We don’t even have half of it despite owning the oil that you boast about. So why should I want to continue in such entity? Who created Nigeria? Let’s start there

2549 2018-10-30 18:25:51 We also need nationalized refineries for energy independence.. or are you more about getting cheap oil to big business?
2550 2018-10-30 18:25:44 The oil sector is less than half of Canada's energy sector, only 3% of the economy, and .5 % of employment.  The Canadian economy is dependent on oil the way I am dependent on watching Ryan Reynolds films.  I COULD do something else, but....
2551 2018-10-30 18:25:32 Thanks man. I mean I definitely know I’m burning oil somehow, but not externally. When I got my oil changed last week I had them check it and they said there’s a very slight crack in the valve seals that “shouldn’t be a problem” so that’s probably the problem.
2552 2018-10-30 18:25:32 As a Zimbabwean have been saying 2008 a lot (cholera,GNU, economic meltdown and elections)
But 2018 has shown us more than a lot.. (cholera, 2 presidents, economic meltdown, elections, AIDS Cure, cooking oil turning into Gold, Bomb explosion... etc)
 You can add

2554 2018-10-30 18:25:21 Man, I can remember so earnestly 'debunking' some of the hysterical Christian things (Druids walked around with gourds full of boiling hot oil & if you didn't swear fealty to the dark gods you had to dunk your hand in the boiling oil! Which they were carrying in a gourd! That's++
2555 2018-10-30 18:25:17 Use coconut oil. I cook with extra virgin coconut oil & extra virgin olive oil nothing else. Happy baking!

2557 2018-10-30 18:24:26 Design nightmare. Recall one maintenance supervisor stating that the inspection access points on panels didn't align with equipment and when you lifted access covers oil ran off the insides of covers and down the neck if your overalls.
2558 2018-10-30 18:24:24 I think “ pretty strands “ just puts Jamaican castor oil in their bottles and change the label. That’s just my opinion it’s the same shit
2559 2018-10-30 18:24:20 I thought that I had heard it all too often.  Recently I heard J Cleese deliver the line about some boys have been running linseed oil into the school cormorant.  I nearly had an aneurism.

2561 2018-10-30 18:24:04 But this arrangement of quoting oil in dollars and selling it for dollars has been around for decades. The markets have adjusted by now.
2562 2018-10-30 18:24:03 Essential oils are Fragrant Oils extracted from plants chiefly through steam distillation (eucalyptus oil) or expression (grapefruit oil)

2564 2018-10-30 18:24:00 If you drove in the rain recently, it might have made it turn on. If the light is still on tomorrow, go check it out. I don’t think it has to do with oil cause the maintenance required light isn’t the one on
2565 2018-10-30 18:23:53 Do you know? Who it was bought oil from isis?? It was turkey under erdogan control, Do you know who build USA embassy in quads??Turk company,?

2568 2018-10-30 18:23:28 Depends. Did that make the Venezuelan presidency abolish the free press, take over the national assembly, tie the entire economy to the price of oil, creating the second most undiversified economy in the world, and hoard food for him while his people eat garbage in the streets?
2569 2018-10-30 18:23:19 I used rosehip oil on my feet instead of lotion and wow never going back
2570 2018-10-30 18:23:14 Doesn't getting an oil change on your car make you feel soo much better about yourself? 
2571 2018-10-30 18:23:01 Manipulation from both parties. Oil Companies have responsibilities to clean up tailing ponds, gas station sites and reclaim strip mining excavation. It's the morally right thing to do. But anti-industrial, anti-human, socialist policies to destroy our economy is morally evil.

2574 2018-10-30 18:22:34 The media blamed it on the Islamic revolution, but this was a lie. The democratically elected president wanted to revert back to a gold standard for oil. Then suddenly the Islamic revolution happened, still to this date to buy oil anywhere you must use American Dollars.

2577 2018-10-30 18:22:16 1. Big oil has funded 99.5% of the no campaign so I highly doubt these signs are by POC groups. 2. It's not an unjust tax (or even a tax). 3. POC groups were very heavily involved in drafting 1631. 4. The sweet irony of the signs being by a more luxury-end car dealership.

2709 2018-10-30 18:06:46 The USA, Saudi Arabia & Russia cannot stabilize oil & gas market; no matter how militarily powerful they might be and no matter how many barrels of oil would they export on daily basis (Some high ranking officials & decision makers see the TREE NOT THE FOREST.
2710 2018-10-30 18:06:44 I need an oil man
2711 2018-10-30 18:06:15 I need to add more lavender oil in this mixture because I don't feel any calming effect whatsoever
2712 2018-10-30 18:06:11 Oil is already running out in lighter

Meltdown, iroha
2713 2018-10-30 18:06:07 Irish spring suck all the oil out ya body. Skin be dryer than communion crackers after you wash with that stuff.

2716 2018-10-30 18:05:52 What about what oil companies have been doing for the past 50 years or so? They knew about their Co2 emissions for decades and have done nothing.
2717 2018-10-30 18:05:52 Money is money and if can’t tell the difference between peanut oil and regular oil I can’t hold it against you but chick fi la will always be number 1 for me
2718 2018-10-30 18:05:49 If I say I only wnt a wash & condition & blow dry, that’s all I want. Don’t tell me I NEED a flat iron- rude. Like bitch fck u. That’s like when I go to Jiffy Lube and ask for just a oil change & they tellin me all this xtra shit I need... my check engine light still on.  
2719 2018-10-30 18:05:28 that’s the usual. you need baby oil or shea butter something intense!
2720 2018-10-30 18:05:28 That's actually a sesame oil. Two table spoons.
2721 2018-10-30 18:05:14 Oil paint is so fun and smells good but shading is hard
2722 2018-10-30 18:05:01 Do you think I should make the lips color or b/w (oil painting)
2723 2018-10-30 18:04:43 Have you ever had to put more oil in your car and did so through the dipstick hole?

Yeah, me neither 
2724 2018-10-30 18:04:41 يعني اللي صار يدافع عن وطنه متاثر بهم ؟؟الحمدلله المملكه ماهي بحاجتك تحدد وين تنفق الفلوس و وين تسامح وهذا الفعل ماهو الا كـ إعانه لهذه الدول ، و جزاها الله خير على ذلك .
2725 2018-10-30 18:04:37 I think its a bit too simplistic to say that oil is the only reason why America has had wars in the middle east..
2726 2018-10-30 18:04:36 Hi Melissa. Palm oil and Palm fat are the same things, they're just industry terms for it :) Let me know if you have any further queries. Thanks - Melissa
2727 2018-10-30 18:04:23 Was a bit.  Sorry about that.  But big @david_fifita_  is no oil painting now is he?
2728 2018-10-30 18:04:23 Why would NATO be interested in an oil tanker?  Could the "Kola" also be a submarine support vessel?

2730 2018-10-30 18:03:55 @FrontlineKamran Brother which kind of oil you apply on your hair? That It looks greasy... Change your style brother...
2731 2018-10-30 18:03:49 Read carefully.  Annual$3 oil on deferred payment will continue for three years. That's why Asad Omar says entire package is of $12 bln. It is 3+(3+3+3) =3+9=12
2732 2018-10-30 18:03:31 I wouldn’t hold my breath. Let’s see what Bolsonaro is all about first, and even then I don’t think there would be any foreign intervention on Venezuela. Speculating, but Vzla oil prod decline can compensate for increase in US, Brasil prod, why would they help?
2733 2018-10-30 18:03:23 Literally: to sell oil
2734 2018-10-30 18:03:06 inject coconut oil into your heart. fucking. jam it in there. fuck. fucking. bathe in it. stick your face in it. fucking. coconut oil RAW
2735 2018-10-30 18:03:02 If all that matters is your precious oil than you're really showing your true colours. Screw your oil. Keep white supremacy groups out of public platform which this party has been giving them

2742 2018-10-30 18:02:31 Still thinking about that bullshit "chocolate smoothie" that was like 20 dates, a liter of water, a TBS of cocoa, and 1 drop of inedible peppermint oil.
2743 2018-10-30 18:02:27 But it does expire actually. Once the oil separates from the paste and changes color, then you should discard. Not so?

2748 2018-10-30 18:02:09 "World oil demand rose by 1.6% (1.5 million barrels a day) in 2017, a much higher rate than the annual average of 1% seen over the last decade.* An increasing share of SUVs and light trucks in major economies and demand from the petrochemicals sector bolstered this growth.
2749 2018-10-30 18:01:55 I gather it's the palm oil in some which is bad for dogs
2750 2018-10-30 18:01:52 We get our oil mainly from Canada and us, Saudi Arabia is only 9 percent.

Or do you think those are paid in Naira? Now since oil has been constantly high now tell us what you have used yours for
2757 2018-10-30 18:00:52 @jimcramer 
Jim, IRAN sanctions start again in 2 days.  Haven’t heard anyone discussing.  Opinions?  Could have some OIL implications AND depending on the Ayatollahs, things could get dicey
2758 2018-10-30 18:00:48 Nothing makes me happier then fresh oil in the Coupe
2759 2018-10-30 18:00:43 The guardian? WTF are you talking about?
What part of "peak" don't you understand? Even if it was 2030 it will not pay off to build new pipelines for tar oil. PERIOD!!!

2768 2018-10-30 17:59:55 Oil Burner License Test Tomorrow. I'm nervous & hyped at the same time if that makes sense!
2769 2018-10-30 17:59:54 LISTEN I freaked out after the second round of bleach was done and I saw how stringy and floppy my hair was when wet. It broke my heart and I cried to my mom. But hopefully with all the masks and oil treatment I’m doing she comes back from this. I’m glad your hair is healing 
2770 2018-10-30 17:59:53 1978 called...

...it wants its Stars back so they can stump for Carter. They mentioned something about an oil embargo.
2771 2018-10-30 17:59:50 Huge environmental cost transferring millions of gallons of water, and the possibility of oil escaping into the soil, as well as waste with high salt content & other contaminents.Crack on though...it's all about the cash after all. Sod handing our kids a healthy planet, eh?
2772 2018-10-30 17:59:46 They aren't. They are concerned about pumping up their consultant money machine bonanza, while fearmongering people into voting for them. Republicans are just straight up evil, but Democrats are snake oil salesmen.

2775 2018-10-30 17:59:27 "Another reason behind robust demand growth is oil used as a petrochemicals feedstock. Petrochemicals are the fastest-growing source of oil demand.."

Also from the report.

2777 2018-10-30 17:59:19 My mom didn’t want me to go to a doctor for my acid reflux and took me to a sobadora instead (masseuse) and she literally cured me by massaging my stomach with some kind of oil. Ugh I love natural medicine and I love my mom 
2778 2018-10-30 17:59:18 Adams putting a temp moratorium in place on new oil and gas permits "to ensure there is no unfair advantage to applicants who might apply under current regulations in the weeks between now and the date that potential changes in the law under Proposition 112 become effective.”
2779 2018-10-30 17:59:00 As we would all be due a share of Scottish assets. This might include the oil industry.
2780 2018-10-30 17:58:56 We are going places my brother
2781 2018-10-30 17:58:51 I’m not an environmental expert. But I can tell you for damn sure that the answer isn’t “freezing fuel duties” and subsidising more oil/gas use...
2782 2018-10-30 17:58:38 today’s mental health day included a target trip to get cleaning supplies to clean my apartment, a trip to the auto shop for a oil change/ engine check, a trip to costco for groceries and gas all before 11am
2783 2018-10-30 17:58:34 "While a slowdown in oil demand growth may be likely in coming years, there are no signs of a peak in demand anytime soon."

From the report.

2785 2018-10-30 17:58:28 Seplat profits soar as oil and gas revenues improve

2787 2018-10-30 17:58:12 There is literally no better moisturizer than coconut oil
2788 2018-10-30 17:58:10 Always pair with a carrier oil like coconut, jojoba, Grapeseed or avocado. My faves are lavender, sandalwood, Clary sage and orange 
2789 2018-10-30 17:58:09 The peak will come before 2030. When it does tar oil will be worthless.
Either way it will come before any new tar oil pipeline even comes close to payback.
Any built now are just welfare for the tar sands.
2790 2018-10-30 17:58:05 Thank goodness! I love their sea salt and olive oil butter.
2791 2018-10-30 17:57:53 Cam doctor said olive oil like that you cook with
2792 2018-10-30 17:57:49 i wiss i haved a color line of this Vsari colors. Its too expencive for me and we dont have them in my country. Best of the best oils. Damned economical crisis.

2794 2018-10-30 17:57:33 So let's also relax the regulations on the Energy East pipeline so we don't need so many polluting ships bringing oil in.
2795 2018-10-30 17:57:26 Nagihh
2796 2018-10-30 17:57:19 Oh, blessings and love! I wish Heidi were here - she knows a lot about natural medicine. I have gotten some relief from CBD oil ... Bruce turned out to have a large infected kidney stone that took a lot of in-depth treatment ...
2797 2018-10-30 17:57:07 When I run out, I use olive oil.  You don’t need much.  My skin sucks it up like it’s never seen lotion.
2798 2018-10-30 17:57:07 The Left sees the United States, and its societal infrastructure – including health care, welfare and subsidized housing systems, not to mention job opportunities – as a world resource, no different from crude oil, potable water or coffee beans. #AmericaFirst
2799 2018-10-30 17:57:04 Wow, talk about cognative dissonance! 
Name 1 Nation that had given away it's natural resources???
Try Scotland...
Oil...given away to London. 
Fish...given away by London.
Your fishing community won't get to decide your fate...
The Tories sold you once n they'll do it again.
2800 2018-10-30 17:56:52 so can we say the coal suppliers should be sued? And when those solar powered electric cars are available, then you going to write about how harmful motor car fuel is? But right now, petrol is fine, so is oil, it does not harm anybody?
2801 2018-10-30 17:56:51 Is that how you see it?  I was picturing liniment oil, potpourri and poligrip (for light BDSM).
2802 2018-10-30 17:56:48 Crude Oil doing nice dive, and autotrader is short.
2803 2018-10-30 17:56:44 Oil Prices fell more than 1 percent in choppy trading on signs of rising supply and concern that global economic growth and fuel demand would be hit by a deepening of the U.S.-China trade dispute
2804 2018-10-30 17:56:41 I’ve been trying to live without ufo oil and it’s not working !!!!
2805 2018-10-30 17:56:37 The prevailing view of the ucp loyal is that the oil industry is inherently linked to Alberta identity & prosperity. They see it as one and the same. So unless you support the never ending expansion of the oilsands you're anti-oil and therefore anti-Alberta
2806 2018-10-30 17:56:24 Fucks sake veganers, please make shit without using coconut oil. It's shit.
2807 2018-10-30 17:56:22 Nasty guys* I marinate my willy in lavender essential oil. Idk bout y'all mans but I like to smell good and smooth.
2808 2018-10-30 17:56:21 We don’t have coconut oil but we have something for your hair 
2809 2018-10-30 17:56:12 would you recommend freshen, castor oil or miss alba my beloved doc?
2810 2018-10-30 17:55:57 Fuckin cops
2811 2018-10-30 17:55:50 Well said. The headline should have been...

"Daft entitled bimbo demands the Red Sea part for her convenience."

They should start telling these stupid women perhaps working on an oil rig might suit you better.

2813 2018-10-30 17:55:41 helichrysum oil is my go to for when I do stuff like this while at the gym or out hiking.

2818 2018-10-30 17:54:56 I need tires my inspection and an oil change 
2819 2018-10-30 17:54:49 One wonders about the motivation for people like George Soros, always thought he was just anti fossils. Maybe he makes big $$ on CDN oil. Certainly lots of Americans have motives for keeping our oil coming at current price!
2820 2018-10-30 17:54:44 Never get an oil change in mount pleasant it’s literally 3X the amount than Livonia
2821 2018-10-30 17:54:41 fuelled vehicles? What is the biggest use of oil? Transportation.
You need to wake the fack up and start paying attention.
2822 2018-10-30 17:54:39 acnes creamy wash/ oil control
2823 2018-10-30 17:54:35 Chill bro. Don't accuse everyone of being pro-Barzani. According to you Apocis, Bashur isn't Kurdistan. It is northern Iraq. No one is kissing Turkish ass. We can't fight Turkey. We can't kick it out. Also, we need Turkey to export our oil. So chill. PKK alone doesn't matter
2824 2018-10-30 17:54:25 Don’t you think Aviation, Power are businesses more insulated from macro events due to long order cycle and long term nature of servicing contracts?
Possibly oil & gas/ transportation have much more volatility
2825 2018-10-30 17:54:19 To give my non-FL friends an idea of how ridiculous the “bundled amendments” are on this year’s midterm ballot, there is a proposal that would 1) ban vaping indoor in public spaces and 2) ban offshore oil and gas drilling. “Public health” is the common denominator, apparently. 
2826 2018-10-30 17:54:17 Love you products I use your oil stableiser on every oil change
2827 2018-10-30 17:54:05 Misinformation. That remark comes from propagandist stories meant to divide us. The truth is there is nothing to steal; the oligarchs in congress have already traded away to their corporate donors, Walmart, pharma industry, oil & gas, and of course their own hand dipped tax cuts
2828 2018-10-30 17:53:52 Finally got my oil change and they washed Mac daddy 
2829 2018-10-30 17:53:36 might as well drink oil

2831 2018-10-30 17:53:31 making fun of media is not being anti-peace tho

and when i say peace i mean like actual "stop bombing and blowing up people's houses because you want their oil and slave labor"
2832 2018-10-30 17:53:26 Mmmm naso, wen there's no oil in your house, kuku go and use power steering oil or break oil, Oil is Oil.
2833 2018-10-30 17:53:18 Yeah thanks pal, I was just lickin ma tail and they had just washed it wiv neam oil soap to try stop me lickin it, so I sicked it up 
2834 2018-10-30 17:53:14 hahahaha Did you read the report? You saw a headline and you thought you were saved lol?
Did you notice how much faster renewables were growing than oil?
Did you notice where the growth markets for oil were? China and Asia. Do you know who are the biggest markets for alternative
2835 2018-10-30 17:53:08 Don’t like food with a lot of oil
2836 2018-10-30 17:53:07 An idea that I am hearing quite a lot lately: if Saudi family toppled, we will have a radical psycho Islamic regime in charge of massive oil reserves.  Is it fair to blame regular Saudis for such mayhem?
2837 2018-10-30 17:52:50 Thanks Ross. It is indeed hypocritical (gaslighting?) to have insurance companies advertise that they care about our well-being AND THEN invest in big oil and help promote climate denial.
2838 2018-10-30 17:52:42 Sí claro..!

2839 2018-10-30 17:52:40 Smoke a blunt. Get you some lavender oil,  rub yourself and your sheets down with it. Pray. Drink some hot tea. You’ll feel better in no time.
2840 2018-10-30 17:52:39 Off shore drilling affects more than the people living in the region. It affects the environment and can be a problem for years. The oil companies that cause the problems. Bankrupt (right) & the tax payers left to pay for cleanup

2842 2018-10-30 17:52:32 I dont think the West is romantic with Saudi Arabia. It is a hostage situation as they control a lot of something we need.
If the oil goes away or we finally no longer need it, all bets are off.
2843 2018-10-30 17:52:29 I hate having a car... I paid $72.00 for an oil change and this shit’s a hooptie. Lmao I knew I should’ve just done it myself lo que me pasa por ser huevona....
2844 2018-10-30 17:52:27 And your comments about the Chinese shows how little you know about Syria. Syria and China are allies and it is HIGHLY likely they will rebuild in Syria. Unlike the USA who destroys it in the name of OIL.
2845 2018-10-30 17:52:22 Chris, listen to me. I need you to rescue two hostages from an underwater oil field. Agent Sherry Birkin... ...and Jake Muller. He's Albert Wesker's son.

2847 2018-10-30 17:51:32 Luckily got my castor oil on deck
2848 2018-10-30 17:51:17 Why aren’t people telling the oil companies to stay out of politics like they do with everyone else who has an opinion on politics. Why the staggering hypocrisy here? Oh yeah, it’s because they do it in the dark and behind closed doors.
2849 2018-10-30 17:51:16 We currently consume 96 million barrels of oil per day, about 1,000 barrels per second. We need 4 million barrels per day from new sources just to keep up with demand. And we're not at peak consumption yet. IEA suggests the peak may be about a 130 million per day in 2030.
2850 2018-10-30 17:51:11 OPEC members are more used to drive Lambos round Knightsbridge and give basic handputs to peons. OECDs need oil to deliver sustenance to peeps that move the world fwd.

2852 2018-10-30 17:50:58 Dale was covered in oil
2853 2018-10-30 17:50:54 What a 'plonker' 
2854 2018-10-30 17:50:47 Slide then with the oil
2855 2018-10-30 17:50:42 Yeah Coco was killed when I was stealing the oil wagon. Rode her in and ran full speed into another horse then I was killed before I could revive her. 
2856 2018-10-30 17:50:36 I’ve never seen the person at the bottom, who empty’s your oil
2857 2018-10-30 17:50:28 This is the result of not going to church for the past 4 weeks, won to get e finally.

But emi Oni LA oju mi sile ki talubo ko wo. (Dials pastor's number)

Pastor, shey e was in church, mo no wa ri yin.

(Drags me out by my ear taking the anointing oil along)
2858 2018-10-30 17:50:18 Nggak tau aku gapernah, paling baby oil aja sih... Pake cotton bud aplikasiinnya
2859 2018-10-30 17:50:10 I remember this bro we did that mandatory course together in my school Maritime academy of Nigeria then I was still a cadet and the bro quiet eehhnn.
2860 2018-10-30 17:50:05 Wrong n false reporting as usual . Oil is at record high n a drag on  rupee. Most currencies are down ; but Rupee is much less down when compared to other currencies. Modi brought $75B to stabilise rupee. Other measures also taken. Economic results are never instant world over.
2861 2018-10-30 17:50:04 Nigeria press are the devil within us, they enjoy pouring oil on the wheel of hatred
2862 2018-10-30 17:50:02 Production licence to produce oil from Kimmeridge is king. We know oil is flowing from Kimmeridge because of HH next door #ANGS
2863 2018-10-30 17:50:01 Lol no Tee I normally go to the dealership and get my oil changed but I drive back  and forth a lot so it burns out faster and it would help me to know
2864 2018-10-30 17:49:58 Stopped going to their auto center since they left the cap off my oil tank after an oil change. They tried to tell me “They didn’t mean to do that.” Uh ... I never said they did.
2865 2018-10-30 17:49:52 I had 5 super ripe bananas, so I looked up a banana bread recipe & I was so shocked that I had everything, even vanilla extract, that I started making it, but forgot I ran out of butter the other day... so I panic added coconut oil & olive oil. It’s in the oven ... & now we wait.
2866 2018-10-30 17:49:44 Not specifically directed at Texas?!?!? Texas by itself would be one of the top five oil producing countries in the world?!? But yeah it wasn’t directed at Texas good point. That’s some critical thinking right there.
2867 2018-10-30 17:49:30 I hope you, and the oil beetles, have your long johns on
2868 2018-10-30 17:49:13 オイルだって怒るんだぞ怒ったら引火してギトギトのボーボーにしてやるからな

2870 2018-10-30 17:49:11 For the first time, someone asked me if I was mixed with Asian.... I am white. White white. Mayo. Not even mayo with olive oil. Just mayo.
2871 2018-10-30 17:49:06 I need to clean my car out and get an oil change

2874 2018-10-30 17:48:59 The only attitude I have is one of total derision towards pseudoscience, quackery, snake oil peddlers, anti-vaxxers, bleaching fanatics, pseudo-religious con artists and grief-mongers who waste more time dwelling on negatives than cultivating acceptance and love for ASD kids.
2875 2018-10-30 17:48:47 The person I’m staying with has a oil for heating and hasn’t refilled so he always uses his wood stove. Comes in handy quite a bit ! And it’s always nice to have the house smelling like a camp fire
2876 2018-10-30 17:48:35 We should put our own tariffs on water, oil and electricity that go straight to Merica.
2877 2018-10-30 17:48:31 How to file taxes. How to change your cars oil. How to correctly do laundry. How to ....

2879 2018-10-30 17:48:09 It maybe cuz Brunson was released for this offensive but I said this weeks ago- SDF is being used as cannon fodder to protect US oil stealing in dier ez zour when SDF land up north is being left unprotected- never trust the US - the native Americans paid that price dearly
2880 2018-10-30 17:47:46 Saudi Arabia is where the US gets there oil.  You gonna boycott driving your car ? There are things we use everyday that we get from Saudi Arabia and I see no hate for it.  Think about it.  @GrimsToyShow
2881 2018-10-30 17:47:37 It’s a nasty but unfortunate truth about AB the good. You rock the oil n gas boat, they come after you. I cite the examples of Dr O’connor & Dr Schindler( who eventually beat the knuckle draggers back & was vindicated)

2885 2018-10-30 17:46:56 dropped my poor car off to get an oil change and now she’s getting 4 new tires too. The dealership asked me if I drove for nascar because my tires were “nascar slick” 

Call me Richard Petty. 
2886 2018-10-30 17:46:56 @DirectDriverA are the black hats and the black/blue #3 @j66anderson hats fitted? They appear to be?

2888 2018-10-30 17:46:35 Ohhh okay I'll keep in mind to buy some coconut oil after work tomorrow. My hair is doing pretty okay in terms of thickness but I always shed like a dog and since I've been dying my hair on my own regularly I'm a bit paranoid that it may have thinned.

2892 2018-10-30 17:46:25 Second Oil Short unwind @66. Third final cover 64 OCO 68 stop.
Unsure if  near 3.05 bond test sufficient other day- still we did a modest market buy/bond sell there with no loss stops now in place
Second Market Buy Thursday (if market positive) otherwise Friday 11/2.
2893 2018-10-30 17:46:20 So that's about 2 weeks of oil revenues. Whoop de doo.
2894 2018-10-30 17:46:10 I’m on the USA and Saudi alliance manipulating the price of oil. Also the fact they wanted to sell oil in their own petro money and the USA were not about to let them get away with that.
2895 2018-10-30 17:46:09 Check your Engine oil this Sunday.
2896 2018-10-30 17:46:08 oil companies and provinces/states.
Once the peak is reached tar oil will become worthless, almost overnight.
2897 2018-10-30 17:46:06 คนนั้นใช่ไหม 555555
2898 2018-10-30 17:46:04 In practice it's more complicated of course. But we do know that oil production got cut since like 2010 and still hasn't recovered. So you can have an explanation for FX pressure even if no stealing. Although there probably was stealing. Definitely bunkering too. :)
2899 2018-10-30 17:46:03 Does anyone have an essential oil diffuser??? If so can someone tell me if theyre helpful im considering getting one
2900 2018-10-30 17:46:02 Adams County commissioners approve interim oil and gas moratorium by 4-1 vote. As emergency ordinance it went into immediate effect. Staff overwhelmed with applications from oil and gas industry in wake of 112. We urged Yes vote.

Only oil & gas industry reps opposed. #YESon112
2901 2018-10-30 17:45:44 I got you Katie: The info is contradictory because the amount of coconut oil and what you’re eating that coconut oil with changes whether or not it’ll hurt you or help you. Just stick with 1 serving and don’t pare it with a lot of carbs, especially sugar. 
2902 2018-10-30 17:45:41 Trying to divert #Khashoggi matter to #Iran. What about #Saudi terrorists USA used in 9/11 plot. To capture oil for the world. Stupid.
2903 2018-10-30 17:45:39 I disagree. Like who's better, a vegan who consumes palm oil or a meat eater who doesn't, the answer is neither. They're both exploiting labor and any environmental benefit is negated by corporate pollution. Going after each other ignores the larger issue.
2904 2018-10-30 17:45:36 i called toyota to get a free oil change and when i asked if i could come in at 3:30 they said “yeah probably”

2910 2018-10-30 17:44:43 The answer to that is a three letter word. Oil
2911 2018-10-30 17:44:40 Also consider 90% almonds grown in California (air miles) most alternative milk sold in tetra pack cartons (non-recyclable). Not quite palm oil bad but bare in mind it not perfect
2912 2018-10-30 17:44:37 There are thousands of services offering to "solve" fake news also known as propaganda with their web site, app, or some such snake oil.
2913 2018-10-30 17:44:36 No, when farmers plant wheat or soya seeds they don’t know whether it will be used to feed humans or animals or both. Soya is a classic example, the oil is a small part of the bean, but the reason it’s grown. Feeding the byproduct to animals is just an economic synergy.
2914 2018-10-30 17:44:34 Nigga at the oil change place stole my blunt out my car 
2915 2018-10-30 17:44:33 Parce ce que les usa, en prévision du peak oil conventionnel de 2006, ont anticipé et envahie l’Irak. Puis la Libye (le top pétrole) avec l aide de la France. Puis tente de faire effondrer la Syrie, qui n exportait plus assez de pétrole (consommation interne). Et lorgne sur Iran
2916 2018-10-30 17:44:26 It's how much Foreign Exchange CBN has saved up. Excess crude is money belonging to Federal, state and Local Govt that accumulates when Crude oil prices rises above budgetary estimates.
2917 2018-10-30 17:44:03 Not really. It’s like warranty. It’s fine by mileage, or time. When you sign up for that, they tell you the amount of time you’ll have that package for. It might be two years, or an example 12 oil changes. Get me?
2918 2018-10-30 17:44:01 Let's go @EdmontonOilers you guys are on a roll, my eyes are on @27MilanLucic  my favorite Oiler!!! GO OIL!!!
2919 2018-10-30 17:43:56 But if Jesse goes to AHL to play for ex Oil asst Woodcroft, there has to be plan for how long he is there. Two wks, a month, longer?
2920 2018-10-30 17:43:46 “What is this?  An audience or an oil painting?  Thanks, you’ve been a great crowd.  Get ready for Carrot Top next.”
2921 2018-10-30 17:43:35 Wrong mike, transportation is the largest user of oil. That is decreasing at an exponential rate.
Previous reports pegged peak use between 2025 and 2035. Those were based on data from 2-3 years ago. The only people who still support those numbers are scammers from North American
2922 2018-10-30 17:43:34 love with oil
2923 2018-10-30 17:43:33 I saw him pitch in the RIMA (RI/MA) Senior Baseball League about 4 years ago, and it was a thrill.  Hitting the corners and the black, Oil Can threw first-pitch strikes almost every time!

2926 2018-10-30 17:43:10 Didn’t they just change the law for oil? That you can get it on prescription now, doesn’t offer the high as no THC.
2927 2018-10-30 17:43:07 Plain nut butters do not need to have more than 3 ingredients. The nuts, extra nut oil (from the same nut, of course), maybe salt. No palm oil, no hydrogenated shit, nothing else needs to be inside it. Flavored nut butters should have 3 at max, plus the only food that flavors it.
2928 2018-10-30 17:42:56 Hm I wouldn't recommend it, because the viscosity of castor oil is very high, and when you massage it in your hair, it can pull at the roots, even if using a little bit. If you mix it with coconut oil and massage it, leave it in for 30 mins, then shampoo + conditioner, voila!
2929 2018-10-30 17:42:54 I have on vasoline and Johnsons baby oil gel. The cold nor ash stand a chance with me today.

2931 2018-10-30 17:42:47 It is! Coat the cauliflower in olive oil and pepper before adding the parm. And for the spinach, mince the garlic. The cauliflower is basically the main dish lol

2933 2018-10-30 17:42:35 Did three important things for self-care the past few days:

- got a refresher course on my mom's sewing machine so I can finish my quilt project

2940 2018-10-30 17:41:57 No, no, let them vote yes. Means more market for our oil.
2941 2018-10-30 17:41:41 They will but we won't be wasting billions on trident, HS2 (which will have no impact on Scotland), London crossrail, doing up WM & Buck Hse. Also companies will be paying corporation tax here, we'll keep all our VAT £ & not forgetting we'll tax the oil n gas companies  unlike WM
2942 2018-10-30 17:41:37 The use of oil in 1 Samuel 10 vs 1 and psalm 89 vs 20, was a symbolic act. Anointing with oil was frequently representative of God's approval. But when I look at the application of anointing oil in *James* *5* it is a symbolic Act invoked with *supernatural* Healing
2943 2018-10-30 17:41:01 Zimpapers have found the trick,its papers $1 but very few copies nwadays,so is Delta,,supplyin @30% CSDs,Bread makers,cooking oil processors cant dare increase the prices,ziso racho rinenge rakavhurwa ipapo,bt still few supplies
2944 2018-10-30 17:41:00 You can thank the greedy corporations burning down rain forests to plant PALMS for palm oil.  Because humans cant live without that cheap oil that is in almost every product you can think of....soaps, Doritos, cookies, cleaners, cooking oil, crisps, candles, Nutella & more.

2948 2018-10-30 17:40:53 Corrupted discipline... you mean like doctors taking cigarette company money to say cigarettes are safe. Or oil companies funding research to deny climate change for the longest time.
2949 2018-10-30 17:40:52 How about the USA getting out of Syria and stop land grabbing it's oil and helping terrorists. And how about the USA lifting unjustified sanctions. In fact the USA owes Syria millions of dollars in war compensation money. Ie the criminal damage and destruction in Raqqa. Get out.
2950 2018-10-30 17:40:50 จัดไปฮะ~
2951 2018-10-30 17:40:48 4 years ago Saudi Arabia told the world Iranian government is coming to steal our oil through Yemen with helping Houdthi; I guess Iranian government assuring Saudi Arabia that creating Shia imperialism through the war was an old slogan.
2952 2018-10-30 17:40:45 Oh my god......I hope you haven’t turned your back on truffle oil and avocados?
2953 2018-10-30 17:40:41 We will see !  Zhenhua Oil is making arrangements to fly in, in late November or early December to lease crude oil tank storage in the Bahamas and sign a crude oil purchase contract for minimum of 2 million bbls monthly/term contract.

All snake oil.
We need you to shut down the “Hurt Feelings Department “, do what you were elected to do and get construction underway.

2963 2018-10-30 17:39:34 The royalty agreements are heavily slanted in favour of the oil and gas companies. It’s the exact reason you shouldn’t be whining about how hard-done-by they are. They’re making billions off our land, people of AB get very little. 

And yes, NDP didn’t raise the royalty rates.

And because oil pipelines are profitable to Putin, Kochs, Exxon, does not mean you must protect their routes.

2968 2018-10-30 17:39:12 Oh good lord. The patchouli oil at a Dead concert is insufferable, but that's just unacceptable.

2970 2018-10-30 17:38:42 Bought a set of essential oils, with an oil diffuser on the way. So yeah, I leveled up in the self care game. 
Currently have "Concentrate Blend" by my desk as a placebo for writing woes?
2971 2018-10-30 17:38:41 #Oman's @PDO_OM has awarded its BOO tender for a 100MW PV plant in Amin to a #Marubeni-led consortium. With the PDO as its sole offtaker, the Amin project is set to be the world's first utility-scale PV project to have an oil and gas company as the sole wholesale buyer of power.
2972 2018-10-30 17:38:39 Sybil Fix, "Upper East Side," oil 29" x 28" $2400. At Dog & Horse Fine Art opening 11/2/2018 5-8 p.m. On view through 1/5/2019. @hobbyfarms @brooklynvegan @AvianBiology @vegan #Vegan #Turkey @TheVeganSociety
2973 2018-10-30 17:38:36 The only place we hear of this mythical "gender pay gap" is on social media and its propagated by "companies" that "profit" off telling women they are treated "unfairly" 
Your PROPAGANDA is nothing more than modern day traveling snake oil. "Cure all" to that ailment. Pathetic
2974 2018-10-30 17:38:24 @RepMikeTurner The social media network platform market has consolidated to the point that it deserves antitrust regulation.  Google, Facebook and Twitter can be characterized as "the Standard Oil and US Steel of the Internet", blocking free speech that they promised to protect.
2975 2018-10-30 17:38:14 Hahaha she will dig & dig until she finds oil
2976 2018-10-30 17:38:08 pictured myself sitting there munching avocados and washing it away with olive oil. Golden.
2977 2018-10-30 17:38:07 เออคิดว่าอ่ะ 555555 น้ำมาถามอยู่ แต่มันก็ยังไม่ได้ไปดูชุดเหมือนกัน 55555 ไม่รู้ตอนนี้ไปยัง

2979 2018-10-30 17:37:53 Here I am a day off schlepping around like I ain't got nothing to do. I gotta pack for NJ and get ready for NYC so far I only did a load of wash and watched a movie had all plans of getting my oil changed. Blah!
2980 2018-10-30 17:37:49 Ugh, I want to kick myself off Twitter but also to shout about block walking, calling etc. Maybe I’ll do it day by day. Gone for today unless/until I wash my clothes in Coke and Dr. Bronner’s (see yesterday’s fish oil thread).
2981 2018-10-30 17:37:34 My "How Do You Sleep" @JustinTrudeau was just disappointment at how an okay seeming PM is Go Oil, crapping all over First Nations and generally dropping the ball (I did not vote for him).
2982 2018-10-30 17:37:32 Hunnigan, could you check and see if the BSAA has only units near the oil field?

2984 2018-10-30 17:37:27 I stopped taking my car to express oil change places when they started doing other services and suddenly started finding all kinds of stuff wrong with my car.  #Cooks Pest Control is apparently starting to do the same thing.
2985 2018-10-30 17:37:23 just did a calamine + golden hemp oil + rose + calendula + chamomile + jojoba oil, face mask and my skin looks absolutely undefeated
2986 2018-10-30 17:37:14 If other poster is right 150 sprays per 10mL would be 15 sprays for 1mL or if you take oil you could look at it as 1mL/15 =0.06mL per spray
2987 2018-10-30 17:37:13 Please keep quiet. External reserves isn't savings. It includes foreign debt already converted to Naira by CBN. If you want to check savings check SWF and excess crude oil account. Stop being disingenuous.
2988 2018-10-30 17:37:09 The oil that you use to control?
2989 2018-10-30 17:37:05 Anyone wanna go with me to get my oil change. I don’t wanna go alone lmao
2990 2018-10-30 17:37:01 Things overheard on the train:

“Call me olive oil, ‘cause I’m extra virgin.”
2991 2018-10-30 17:36:58 Why is it that in Alberta one can only be a real supporter of oil/gas, oil sands, pipelines if you're a @jKenney-style conservative? Why not centrists like me who also support carbon pricing, emission reductions, de-carbonizing, etc? What kind of pure laine BS is that?
2992 2018-10-30 17:36:57 555555 คงนอกรอบแบบสิ้นเดือนพ.ย. 555555555
2993 2018-10-30 17:36:49 Took my Chevy to the levee but then the Chevy would stall out, I tried to change the oil but it wouldn’t work so I pushed the Chevy by hand, by then the levee had lost interest so we just put on some Netflix and fell asleep.
2994 2018-10-30 17:36:45 Govt won't cut anything. Govts at all levels would borrow more until we can't borrow again. Then we would try to print money. When oil prices crash again, we would blame the govt of the day for causing recession. 
The cycle would keep going on and on
2995 2018-10-30 17:36:36 So I played that game Dishonored it kinda starts with RANSON FUEL and tech in Pierro's workshop, the computer already had that relationship.

Whale oil already as a REAL link to our universe! Look up Pure Petroleum Jelly. In that game not so much so people are Whaler's.

3005 2018-10-30 17:35:42 วันไหนนน
3006 2018-10-30 17:35:39 I went to get the oil change done. The person doing it said that I needed a new tire in the back and rear brakes.
3007 2018-10-30 17:35:16 Do you do Acrylics or Oil? I've been doing oil painting.
3008 2018-10-30 17:35:14 Cons are pushing propaganda that all social democracies will end up like Venezuela to confuse and cloud the definition of socialism. If you read the history of Venezuela, it wasn’t socialism that upended society, it was megalomaniac leaders & foreign political influence. And oil
3009 2018-10-30 17:34:52 The answer is *YES*. The oil symbolises the Holy Spirit
3010 2018-10-30 17:34:46 He's an absolute dude Fireman Sam though. Just swinging off a helicopter, landing on a burning oil tanker and saving the driver before driving it into a tree & diving out at the last minute. "I'm just doing my job."  #firemansam #setforaction
3011 2018-10-30 17:34:40 Bro where is this? Is this that oil factory thing?
3012 2018-10-30 17:34:36 Y’all ever had somebody say they’re getting a headache from your vape sitting on the counter top away from them? And say it’s the oil or juice stuff that’s IN THE TANK? Me neither until today.
3013 2018-10-30 17:34:30 I'd have thought that would be standard practice in most countries tbh.

Oil? check.
Petrol? check.
Tyres? check.
Sober driver? ...

3014 2018-10-30 17:34:16 $75 for that synthetic oil change hurts everytime

3017 2018-10-30 17:34:00 Oil what please can't see it clear
3018 2018-10-30 17:34:00 Nice pic but don’t forget that the Amish don’t use sustainable palm oil and are known to have the cruelest puppy mills in this country.
3019 2018-10-30 17:33:59 Oil
3020 2018-10-30 17:33:53 Surprisingly, California has but a 2 mile limit as well. Granted, most of the oil is within that 3 miles, and farther out is very, very deep water
3021 2018-10-30 17:33:36 Try Moroccan oil split end infusion as a finisher when your hair is dry!! I LOVE that stuff. Also I use redken one United, and redken extreme antisnap out of the shower and it seems to help
3022 2018-10-30 17:33:35 Crude oil futures for Dec fall further Tuesday afternoon. $WTI_Crude -1.19% at $66.24, $NBZ_F -1.77% at $75.97, $USO -0.43% at $14.05 for 10/30/18.
3023 2018-10-30 17:33:31 You mean about 12billion more?won't make anything if Westminster keeps allowing companies to take our oil tax free and an indy Scotland will tax our oil like every other oil rich country and we will actually profit for once it seems there are too many Westminster mps on the take.
3024 2018-10-30 17:33:23 Should be 351 mg of thc total in there but it would vary on the spray bottle itself. With syringes, a full normal oil syringe would equal 1 gram or 1mL thus giving you 15 doses of 23.4mg thc per syringe. Id definately contact Hexo to see how much volume each spray produces
3025 2018-10-30 17:33:17 *Application* *Today* :

It is often asked by even Believers if anointing people who are sick with oil as mentioned in James 5 still apply today?
3026 2018-10-30 17:33:13 Well, the real thing is they already decided to stop buying your Regimes’ #Oil
3027 2018-10-30 17:33:07 ก็คงต้องรอดูลาดเลาตอนซ้อมอ่ะ
3028 2018-10-30 17:32:56 Baby oil or cooking...
3029 2018-10-30 17:32:54 If more people start thinking of selling their cars, there will be less demand of oil which will result in reduction of fuel prices.
3030 2018-10-30 17:32:49 So oil and gas thieves pay even less for their loot and you consider that a good thing?
3031 2018-10-30 17:32:49 I told Joy I want oil company work. How she heard oil company husband is beyond my own mortal understanding.
Now I'm expected to send my Akwa Ibom woman CV because oil company husband likes white soup.

Why is it always me in creepy situations?
3032 2018-10-30 17:32:42 Well that can be said, IF you're big business (i.e. pharma, tobacco, oil so on and so forth or ) maybe because he cared about the people more than the his predecessors and successor. Other than that I don't see it.
3033 2018-10-30 17:32:34 You held your end of the bargain with the hats, so I'm dropping some coin on payday!
3034 2018-10-30 17:32:23 Companies that had business dealings with Nazis: I G Farben/Bayer (Zyklon B) , Siemens, Allianz (who insured Auschwitz), Hugo Boss (SS uniforms), Mercedes Benz (Hitler's limo), Standard Oil (Luftwaffe aviation fuel)...  all you want, none of those guys were workers' co-ops.
3035 2018-10-30 17:32:15 Hahahahaha haters will always hate. The caterer will provide the oil, rice, spoons, disposable plates, salt and much more. Hahahahaha dint answer these illiterates abeg

3037 2018-10-30 17:32:07 he's like the left to kiss his ass, then smack it, then rub it in hot oil, then.....
3038 2018-10-30 17:31:55 Like a place where oil springs up from the ground if you dig and you can fly on a magic carpet?
3039 2018-10-30 17:31:49 First of all. Stop using the neocon term Regime. If you want to talk about Syria it is the Syrian Government. Legitimately elected under International Observers. Second the USA has no business being in Syria. GET OUT and take your grubby paws off the oil. The USA disgusts me.
3040 2018-10-30 17:31:45 Nick you’ve got to step you scrambled egg game up. Add cooking oil to pan(1 table spoon per egg) and DO NOT add milk. Wisk eggs before putting in pan. The oil is the major key.
3041 2018-10-30 17:31:39 But we pretty much never intervene unless something is in it for us. The only reason we condemn Venezuela is because they nationalized their oil industry. Is Maduro bad? Yeah. But we ignore our role in what’s happening there entirely while we call him out for human rights abuses.
3042 2018-10-30 17:31:36 I want Coconut Oil @OlaedoNaturals
3043 2018-10-30 17:31:35 They are all oil go to Malaysia and see palm oil sellers are bogers there
3044 2018-10-30 17:31:23 Ko did you hear @Zambezi_Lager has been losing polls to Lacto and Cooking oil
3045 2018-10-30 17:31:07 Well... ok.
3046 2018-10-30 17:30:44 Brethren *Note* : 
When the early believers used anointing oil to Anoint , it was as a reminder of God's healing power.
3047 2018-10-30 17:30:40 Another Twat giving us southerners a bad name. Stop being such a bad dickhead Tom ffs, your no oil painting yourself

3051 2018-10-30 17:30:15 @SaludAmerica Like with any habit, change is eventual. Substituting healthy ingredients for 'bad' ones is a step-by-step process. e.g. Don't use shortening. Instead use avocado or olive oil. (that is, use the most expensive ingred's your budget allows) #SaludTues
3052 2018-10-30 17:30:11 Since its the spookiest time of the year, we have a special #TriviaTuesday just for #Halloween. Which of the following can be made from oil and gas?
3053 2018-10-30 17:30:06 Palm oil isnt sustainable  at all and involves widesread deforestation..ive seen so called sustainable plantations in malaysia..they are far from it believe me..discuss. 10 marks
3054 2018-10-30 17:30:01 Sounds like your all about dismantling the Country good to know. It will interesting to see what happens when your Alberta supporters want equalization because their oil has run dry. Conservatives can’t win politics of regional division and anti environment. Good luck though.
3055 2018-10-30 17:29:59 Art reflects society. Artists making Animated GIF art now in our networked digital society are as credible a format as say Pop Artists making oil paintings of ads in the 60s #nftart #superrare #knownorigin #opensea
3056 2018-10-30 17:29:48 Good Lord Kathryn - you do know I'm a junior doctor these days and not an oil baron?! :-D Actually the weather/water was too bad even for gondoliers. Literally every business was shut or bailing out water :(
3057 2018-10-30 17:29:46 And this Mordor line you keep spouting, is from the Dicaprio movie, funded by guess who... Tides Foundation. Taking advice from a guy who thought a chinook was caused by oil sand activity, not worthy of a vote.
3058 2018-10-30 17:29:42 If I order now will you just bring it with you and hand deliver it to me on Friday? 
3059 2018-10-30 17:29:36 If you're white, spend warm days in the sun, grab the baby oil instead of sunscreen, then why do you dislike brown people? Aren't you kinda trying to emulate? #VoteBlue #NoHate #TuesdayThoughts
3060 2018-10-30 17:29:24 I prefer 2 (palm oil stew) to 1 (pepper stew)
3061 2018-10-30 17:29:22 @GovernorNanok Good Evening. Was a visitor to your county. Good work development wise keep it up was really impressed. Now understand the reason for higher oil % share you are seeking.
3062 2018-10-30 17:29:18 Anointing oil was commonly used as a healing agent.
3063 2018-10-30 17:28:59 Finance Min. Tom Osborne says the Fall Fiscal Update is coming on Tuesday. 

Apparently oil prices were higher than budgeted, but production was down. #nlpoli
3064 2018-10-30 17:28:49 What’s a good oil to use to moisturize your hair ?
3065 2018-10-30 17:28:45 GS? The world’s biggest hedge fund? They predicted oil at $200 on the way up, $20 on the way down.
3066 2018-10-30 17:28:40 Higher oil prices are the cause of this panic imho. Higher oil prices has increased inflation, which in turn is leading to higher bond yields. Nobody wants to own the 10y at 2% when inflation is expected at 3%. The sell of in tech makes sense but the sell of in oil equities dont.
3067 2018-10-30 17:28:36 do you put oil in the pan before making eggs? tryna see something right quick
3068 2018-10-30 17:28:35 Lets pick one thing. Umm....blocking protections for federal land and allowing companies to drill for oil/frack/restricting regulations on dumping waste. 

There’s a lot when you unleash capitalism. That leash is important.
3069 2018-10-30 17:28:30 I'm not worried about it the people I've talked to and studies I've done with the keto diet suggests using coconut oil with certain things so not worried about that. Thanks though
3070 2018-10-30 17:28:16 Will be putting mine in soon too! Great job @DirectDriverA !
3071 2018-10-30 17:28:01 This is not a choice between different flavors of ice cream. It is a choice between cod liver oil and ricin.
3072 2018-10-30 17:28:00 The scriptures above talk about the power of the Anointing oil

3083 2018-10-30 17:27:09 Yes, and it thickens it too. But don't use it as is, or it causes hair fall; mix 1/4th castor oil to 3/4th coconut oil and then use it

3089 2018-10-30 17:26:17 Continental  CLR presented its 3q18 result. At first sight everything looks pretty good. A closer looks reveals instead a soaring gas oil ratio GOR, which stands at 0,82. By next year CLR is a gas producer (GOR>1). No wonder the share price tanked over the last two weeks. #OOTT
3090 2018-10-30 17:26:06 Ouuu child yesss!! I got you hair mask and a deep hot oil treatmentthis weekend? 
3091 2018-10-30 17:25:58 Pretty sure Carter lost re-election because of the ensuing oil crisis and economic stagnation that occurred after 1976 tho
3092 2018-10-30 17:25:56 As per MEPC, Plan for ships to implement the 0.50% sulphur limit should also address issues relating to the use of compliant fuel oil which include the capability/suitability of the ship’s equipment to handle different fuel types and associated characteristics.

3100 2018-10-30 17:24:51 brought my baby to get a oil change, she finna get washed and vacuumed 
3101 2018-10-30 17:24:28 My oil changes are free tho ....
3102 2018-10-30 17:24:27 Thank you @LandOLakesInc for doing the right thing! BTW my favorite is the “light with canola oil.” The one with the green lid....
3103 2018-10-30 17:24:26 Still gonna clog the drain eventually. And too strong of a shampoo is going to strip the oil from the hair, too, letting the tangle come right back.

3105 2018-10-30 17:24:15 @LetsFishSmarter "if we converted every vehicle to an electric vehicle, and shut down Holyrood, NL hits it's 2030 emission reductions target - even w/ continuance of offshore oil & gas". 

Be imaginative, folks.
3106 2018-10-30 17:24:08 I honestly hate getting my oil changed. They always want to sell my every other thing they can. My $30 oil change would turn into $300+ if I let them.
3107 2018-10-30 17:24:05 Oil and Gas Regulatory bodies barley know their own Directives. It’s embarrassing when you have to explain their own rules to them. The system is so broken. 

The best is when you have to re-write THEIR approval letter because they don’t understand the application. What a Circus
3108 2018-10-30 17:24:02 I’m on day 3 of taking CBD oil and holy shit, I can’t recommend it enough.

3110 2018-10-30 17:23:46 *Laying Hands on the sick* 

Throughout the scriptures one can find the practice of anointing with oil

3112 2018-10-30 17:23:25 I currently have 2 olive oil bottles in my home, one is Pure, and one is Extra Virgin. These biblical ideals of olive oil are boring and outdated. As an Atheist, I'd much rather hang out with an olive oil that's fun, non-judgmental, and not afraid of some kink.
3113 2018-10-30 17:23:22 *Why Do We Anoint With Oil?* 

The main reason we Anoint with oil is to consecrate a person, place or thing to God. Anointing with oil also is part of the church's ministry to the sick.
3114 2018-10-30 17:23:06 Can someone pls explain to me y the employees that change ur oil yell at each other like they in the army?
3115 2018-10-30 17:22:51 Sadly my father sets my oil change days and made me sign a paper saying I will get oil changes when needed. Not even kidding. He wants it notarized lmao
3116 2018-10-30 17:22:44 Yes with almond oil
3117 2018-10-30 17:22:32 The ancient practice of anointing with oil goes back to the old Testament. 
The oil was poured over the heads of prophets, priests and Kings

Is an act that changes regular *Olive* *oil* into spiritual symbol and tool
3121 2018-10-30 17:22:13 Dear Les Da Chef
If I use a non-stick pan when making magwinya, do I still need to use oil? 

3122 2018-10-30 17:22:07 LOL..you sound so naïve...NOTHING is free, and people don't do shit for free. 
Why not just have a money-less society? Meanwhile, people in oil rich Venezuela are eating their own pets because their starving to death...but but but they had free Gov healthcare!!

 How oil became so central to our world
3137 2018-10-30 17:20:50 A good strong shampoo should break down the oil pretty well. I put the spoo straight onto the oiled hair then rinse with water after it’s lathered up!

So what will you spend it on, increase in gas and electricity prices, more on the petrol the oil giants force on you to fill their pockets. We won’t benefit as much as the rich.
3159 2018-10-30 17:18:26 ...he said the recent report by the Nigerian Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) showed that the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and oil majors had yet to remit $22 billion and N481 billion to the Federation Account.

3199 2018-10-30 17:14:46 The entire purpose of this pipeline is to ship it to America. If you were concerned about profits on our oil you'd be building refineries, not pipelines through protected land.

3202 2018-10-30 17:14:25 Because while revenue from oil has fallen the Barnet formula keeps Scotland's budget topped up. It's because of the extra costs in  Scotland  due to the remote nature of the Highlands and islands

3212 2018-10-30 17:13:08 I like oil more. It’s a lot smoother and it lasts a lot longer for me. It’s also a bit more discrete :).
3213 2018-10-30 17:12:59 new deal with Chinese to get oil flowing again, price of oil high things will improve
3214 2018-10-30 17:12:58 You might also want to look into camellia oil for the future. I find that you can put that on dry hair (just a few drops) better than coconut (i think it's something about the coconut molecules are bigger but don't quote me as I am bad at science)
3215 2018-10-30 17:12:49 just put castor oil all over my eyebrows, beard, and hair. I better look like reece king next year.

In a large bowl, add the sugar, egg yolks, ricotta cheese, water, lemon oil, and melted butter. Mix thoroughly.

Next incorporate the flour. Do not over-mix. Set aside.

In a separate clean bowl or stand-mixer bowl, whip the egg whites until soft peaks form

3224 2018-10-30 17:11:55 That's a false dichotomy. The choice is not between solar and fossil fuels. Rather, the choices are among:
- coal
- nat gas
- oil
- solar (panels)
- solar (thermal)
- wind
- geo
- hydro
- tidal
- reduced consumption
- curbing overpopulation
- better city planning

3234 2018-10-30 17:10:57 Sorry dude, not buying your snake oil.
3235 2018-10-30 17:10:49 Well the oil industry is all about export.  To power countries like China with a terrible human rights record.  I'll care about where we get our oil from the minute you care who we sell it to.
3236 2018-10-30 17:10:49 Infuse that ish into the oil you use! Decarb bud in oven & double boil it & the oil (all at high enough temp to activate thc without burning it). strain oil out of used bud thru coffee filters/cheese cloths then cook the noodles in it (low enough to not burn thc). Send us some

3250 2018-10-30 17:09:45 Some one come scoop me up from ipac ingram and hang out for 2 hours while my truck gets an oil change !
3251 2018-10-30 17:09:45 if you can, add some tea tree or eucalyptus oil. those will both help open up your sinuses! hope you feel better soon!
3252 2018-10-30 17:09:29 Bofl yup that’s why u use more then one cap or I put a plastic bag or shower cap under it ... except this last time ! But oil is the key
3253 2018-10-30 17:09:17 Who says I'm not concerned about water?  I deal with my personal use of oil by working to stop the much larger offenders--coal and tar sands.  Shutting down pipelines is a great way to reduce your carbon footprint! How do you deal with yours?
3254 2018-10-30 17:09:13 yes yes, I meant to watch it while I'm waiting for my oil change but I forgot to bring headphones

3260 2018-10-30 17:08:22 Somtimes I fear that’s why we get in anywhere. Not because we care about the ppl but because we want something. I understand peace in the Middle East means we have a better chance at peace here. But that oil is pretty attractive too. Not a lot of black and white issues anymore

3269 2018-10-30 17:07:10 112 goes beyond drilling. It is a 2500 ft setback on ALL oil and gas development meaning you can’t put in a pipeline to transport the product. So it is a ban on oil and gas not a setback

3272 2018-10-30 17:07:06 IMO step 1 is "swap USD for real assets."  Step 2 is "set up exchanges for underlying real assets in local currency instead of USD's."  Step 3 is "launch trading".  Step 4 is "physical settlement."  For oil, the most critical real commodity, we are now in early phase of step 4.

3280 2018-10-30 17:06:33 I think we need to work towards only using oil to transition to an oil less economy.  That's not going to be done by expanding the tar sands mostly for export.  The longer we delay change the harder the fall.

3334 2018-10-30 17:01:31 few understand that WW oil, gas only being found in expensive sites (tar sands, deepwater, fracking). miners also have exploited all shallow mineral  resources (low hanging fruit) and have to dig deeper. Going deeper requires 2X the energy per foot (1 foot deeper, 1 foot climb)
3335 2018-10-30 17:01:23 Gary, do you ever feel like you are playing some sort of twitter video game. You fire a fact bullet at the anti oil/gas/carbon pollution tweeter and poof their message disappears.

We are still selling vehicles today that will be around presumably at least another 25 years. And do you think solar panels and wind turbines get built without oil?
3338 2018-10-30 17:01:12 I *like* twitter debate already. People make me laugh, and sometimes make my #FucktardOfTheDay list, and I get to DEBATE with other epilepsy peeps (I'm only on #CBD oil because of helpful epi tweeps). HOW IS THIS NOT QUALITY DEBATE ALREADY. 'If it ain't broke, break it' 
3339 2018-10-30 17:01:10 It's too bad more information wasn't published about horizontal drilling. It's been used for many years to extract oil and gas from under our homes, parks, schools, nature reserves, and anywhere you can't install physical rig. Directional boring is used more than we know.

3350 2018-10-30 17:00:10 No, the oil needs to stay in the ground--thats why I'm opposed to new pipelines and oil by rail.  I don't care if it's worth $150/barrel the atmosphere is key to our survival. I'm opposed to refineries because it's an excuse to keep the tar sands going.
3351 2018-10-30 17:00:07 @AskTSA why can't people bring CBD oil onboard but we can ship it?

3364 2018-10-30 16:57:53 Whether the projects were initiated by somebody else or not. The point is that every government from 1999 could have done more with the proceeds of oil the country was making. Dubai was built within the same time. Buhari definitely in a different class to the rest of you looters
3365 2018-10-30 16:57:51 @ChefMilzzy said “don’t put the oil in the pan, put it on the steak” my guy, if this turns out bad sizolwa!

3367 2018-10-30 16:57:31 The only thing more Oilersy than thinking Chiasson is a top sixer would be Glenn Anderson riding an oil well gusher with a heavily dusted moustache and a Pink Floyd laser show in the background.

3371 2018-10-30 16:57:13 Don't forget too soon, Nigerians where getting subsidy on crude oil products eg petroleum, kerosene etc.

3373 2018-10-30 16:57:07 Why is it so hard for me to get an oil change bruh

3375 2018-10-30 16:56:43 None, in their desire to regress as a society, and destroy our environment, they're all switching to whale oil lamps!

3382 2018-10-30 16:55:50 But he helped to create the conditions where Trump can flourish. It’s like a big oil executive suddenly freaking out about climate change without recognized his own complicity.
3383 2018-10-30 16:55:46 I have property in Missouri and i spent half of my time in Colorado.  I either lease a place for 6 months or go month by month.  I have oil partner in Wichita and we are working on 3 year supply contract with Zhenhua Oil/China and Bahama crude oil terminal. I live to ski. 
3384 2018-10-30 16:55:41 DID FORD, GM, CHRYSLER OR THE OTHER EARLY AUTO MANUFACTURERS BUILD THE FUEL NETWORK? NO!
OIL COMPANIES DID. WHY IS IT UP TO TESLA TO BUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE? I KEEP HEARING, TESLA DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH CHARGE STATIONS ARGUMENT, WHY IS IT UP TO TESLA TO BUILD THE NETWORK?

3389 2018-10-30 16:55:00 Omg it looks like an oil slick! I freaking love this style 
3390 2018-10-30 16:54:51 All I know is wages, taxes, unemployment, the stock market, crime, drugs, human trafficking,   ISIS, bribing NoKo and Iran, reliance on foreign oil and having unelected foreigners telling our country what to do ravaged us before Trump came along. PS the govt run care for vets sux
3391 2018-10-30 16:54:49 @iamkissdaniel Big bros, help your hustling brother on the street pls....an amount to buy local rice and red oil will go a long way to revive my strength..Pls!!!
3392 2018-10-30 16:54:48 Lmfao yes bitch no oil hair spray no nothing,  sorry about that got you right that second time though when it was me you and dymond at the house .
3393 2018-10-30 16:54:47 interesting. having the 4% cap on the use of oil profits is a good idea, however, they have been forced to go over that 'cap' on a few occassions. I dare say that Norway will gradually divert that fund to pay for policies after the oil has run out.
3394 2018-10-30 16:54:45 @sahneydeepak sir. Where is the bottom for Indus Ind. and your view on govt oil companies.

3399 2018-10-30 16:53:50 It was labour who gave us the NHS.  It was them who gave us tax credits.  They gave our elderly and disabled free bus travel & I am sure a lot more.

Deek will have more to spend this year than he  would've had if YES had won in 2014.  What happened to the £8bn a year oil revenue

3406 2018-10-30 16:52:35 Yes they do, that’s why Venezuela has no money.
Everybody is being friends with Saudi Arabia as they are planning to publish when the company gets floated on the stock exchange exactly how many barrels of oil they have & the amount they can still produce.
3407 2018-10-30 16:52:33 What about the killing of live people? The climate change issue is a problem because Republicans want to keep oil alive to line their pockets with money instead of looking for ways to save our earth. And the gun laws in this country are absurdly terrible.
3408 2018-10-30 16:52:31 Thank you @LandOLakesKtchn 
Very ethical decision. My husband loves your olive oil/butter soft spread. 
3409 2018-10-30 16:52:22 @MomentsWithBren Good afternoon I'm a graduate of marine science and technology. I did a research on organic extracts and i got vital results which will be important to some oil companies...The prob now is that I don't know how to relate this to them!Please can you give me a clue

3411 2018-10-30 16:52:15 It was alive. He doused it, threw it in, it jumped out, he chased and caught it, re-doused it (gas and oil) and threw it back on. Also, it was the family pet so it’s not like he caught a random stray. He did it to his PET.

3417 2018-10-30 16:50:54 Saharareporters writes junk and that is why Sowore can never be taken serious.Nigerians will and condemn Buhari but this is not true. The truth is oriental entered into an agreement with afren to run their oil block. Afren was responsible for the financing

3419 2018-10-30 16:50:45 It's not all unhealthy. Olive oil, peanut and sunflower are perfectly healthy. The unhealthy part is the breading. Try Panko(msp) or other more natural breading. It can be healthier, just use a lil smarts about it lol
3420 2018-10-30 16:50:45 I mean it’s usually vegetable oil lol
3421 2018-10-30 16:50:41 Spotted the mention of Fontodi oil.  I went to their vineyard in Panzano the other day to buy a couple of bottles, a favourite of mine! Where is Kings?  Would love to try on my return (the lapin looks absolutely delicious, as does the whole menu).

3430 2018-10-30 16:49:14 Harper made a bet with all the eggs in a single basket and lost. This isn't what Chavez did. Chavez expropriated and regulated the economy to death, so that the only thing left was the State-run oil industry, which subsidized everything and imported most of the food.

3440 2018-10-30 16:48:07 This product has always contained this ingredient. A misconception is that all ingredients with the word alcohol are liquids and dry hair. In fact, the fatty alcohols SheaMoisture uses are solids, derived from coconut oil and plant sugars, are excellent conditioners for hair.
3441 2018-10-30 16:47:59 Because Alberta oil isn't any better.  It's full of sulphur and difficult to transport and refine.  It's turning the boreal forest into Mordor, or a  moon-scape--for if you prefer.  The chance to build refineries and sell Canada oil is done.  And, it's in my country.

3462 2018-10-30 16:46:28 Best Practice for Fuel Oil Suppliers for assuring the quality of fuel oil delivered to ships. It focuses on quality control during production, supply chain, transport, storage and transfer excluding low flashpoint fuels such as LNG, LPG or methyl/ethyl alcohols and pure biofuels

3465 2018-10-30 16:46:01 This is a really important issue and we’ve been at the forefront of driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years. We’re on track to meeting our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.
3466 2018-10-30 16:45:58 I use olive oil and add herbs to the dough. I wash the tops with egg whites for extra crunch. Love olives, cheese, bread w/ balsamic/ olive oil for dipping and a nice dry red lol

3468 2018-10-30 16:45:44 FACT: The world needs all remaining fossil fuels to stay in the ground, oil subsidies diverted to renewables and heavy investment in negative emissions technology. This is the only way to have a sustainable ocean economy.

3472 2018-10-30 16:45:30 As a country our tax money is being cut from all public & welfare sevices while at the same time we are spending £Billions killing children overseas for the love of oil & power.

3476 2018-10-30 16:45:22 I’m struggling to understand what side of the debate you’re on. Investing in refineries bad, we should get a fair value for our oil, but we shouldn’t do something because our government hasn’t done a good job thus far?

3490 2018-10-30 16:43:28 I read a Reddit thread that if you break the highest barrier once (200k I think) you’re in the loot pool for highest drop rate. That allows you to speed run after your high score run and still pull the high drop rate. That could be all snake oil though.
3491 2018-10-30 16:43:27 ชีวิตของเรามีความสุขเหลือเกิน มีเพียงไม่กี่เรื่องหรอกที่ทุกข์ เพราะเราไม่สนใจใครทั้งนั้น แคร์คนที่เขาแคร์เรา เคารพคนที่ควรเคารพ ทำมาหากิน หรือทำก็ได้ที่มีความสุข ไม่ต้องสนใครแค่นั้นเอง แล้วก็มีหลายๆคนที่กูปั้นหน้าใส่เพราะเขาไม่จริงใจ อาจจะเห็นกูหัวเราะเฮฮาปาจิงโกะ นั่นคือหลอกลวง
3492 2018-10-30 16:43:22 Please retweet until some leftist/socialist comes up with a rational, verifiable answer. If you’re so positive socialism will work why is Venezuela broke & eating their zoo animals? They have the largest oil reserves in the world and the people can’t eat. Can you explain that?
3493 2018-10-30 16:43:12 Thanks @EnergzdEconomy for sharing this!! @JoeMcMonigle take on the Oil & Gas Market is always brilliant - @AnthonyCrudele great discussion #OIL #Energy
3494 2018-10-30 16:43:09 Me: do I really need my oil changed? My car won’t explode 
Also me: spend $50 on snacks at 7/11
3495 2018-10-30 16:42:51 Dropped all fat..oil ..pasta...
3496 2018-10-30 16:42:43 Seriously, I don't believe any state cannot afford to pay minimum wage. The problem is that the governors spend on frivolities. Anambra is not an oil producing state. Yet Peter Obi paid salaries when due, owed nobody but had billions saved. @LagosTalks913
3497 2018-10-30 16:42:37 Virgin coconut oil?
3498 2018-10-30 16:42:36 This is a really important issue and we’ve been at the forefront of driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years. We’re on track to meeting our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.
3499 2018-10-30 16:42:27 @realDonaldTrump hey bussy boy  my ass is full of oil ready for you to liberate me 
3500 2018-10-30 16:42:27 There is plenty of body-something there but it ain’t body oil...
3501 2018-10-30 16:42:24 By now we should be entirely powered by clean energy.
There is no need for us to depend on foreign oil or fossil fuels that are filthy.
Other countries are leading the way and making us look like ridiculous, polluting, backwards dinosaurs.
3502 2018-10-30 16:42:20 Make she flip am abi just make we throwway with the oil too?
3503 2018-10-30 16:42:15 i’m ordering oil online as i type!!!!!
3504 2018-10-30 16:42:08 We do state on our website, confirmation email and T&C's that if required, specialist oil is £24 + VAT. We never add any hidden costs. We will never authorise work without confirmation from the customer.
3505 2018-10-30 16:42:02 coconut oil or vitamin e. coconut oil has worked the best for me but be careful. i gave my little sister some and her skin said BITCH HALT. lmao

3507 2018-10-30 16:41:57 Lots of reasons given in his presentation. For example - He talked about how many companies we are being asked to divest from are changing their businesses away from polluting fuels. Also the demand forecast which shows the large ongoing demand for coal, oil and gas.
3508 2018-10-30 16:41:55 #AuburnWorldHistory An example that I know of as that in Nigeria, exploitations by foreign oil companies in the Niger Delta has rightfully caused land disputes from the local minorities. Shows the nasty side of an imperialistic trade system.
3509 2018-10-30 16:41:52 Everybody likes the gas and oil industry until their property values increase
3510 2018-10-30 16:41:52 Yes, billions and decades to pay off. That's why it's a lost chance, and now it's too late.  We have to have a contraction of the oil industry.

3513 2018-10-30 16:41:30 They convince you that our oil is the dirtiest (California oil is dirtier) so that we can’t get it to any other market, including our own provinces. Then they sell you gasoline from our oil at a $1.60 a litre while Americans get there’s at less than half the price.
3514 2018-10-30 16:41:29 Still outwages the oil industry.
3515 2018-10-30 16:41:27 1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast
2-1/4 cups warm water (110° to 115°)
3 tablespoons sugar
1 tablespoon salt
2 tablespoons canola oil
6-1/4 to 6-3/4 cups all-purpose flour

Easy way to get this

3518 2018-10-30 16:41:10 One of the most important steps in preparing your heavy equipment for hauling is to clean it first. Cleaning off all dirt, debris, oil, and fluids from your equipment is a good way to minimize scratches and other related damage during transport.

3520 2018-10-30 16:40:51 Vitamin E is great for your face since it’s so lightweight ...I also use coconut oil on my body after I apply lotion in order to seal the moisture.  My ls suggested putting the oil in the shower I’m trying that out now and seeing how that works.
3521 2018-10-30 16:40:47 @AskTSA CBD OIL  or CBD capsules are allowed on planes correct? As long as the oil is within the travel allowed oz. for carry ons?

3525 2018-10-30 16:40:27 why was this so slow to happen. the oil price collapse was years ago, new construction rampant, and yyc has nearly the highest unemployment rate in the province.

3529 2018-10-30 16:39:44 Perhaps the fish oil more than mediates.
3530 2018-10-30 16:39:43 Want to read all day! Got a little pocket of reading time while getting the oil changed in my car but then a guy also waiting carried on 3 back-to-back and loud phone calls...
3531 2018-10-30 16:39:42 Bloody lovely day in Bordeaux with @Fydsy. Reserved a guitar. Bought yarn. Bought oil paints. Ate cake. Drank coffee. Laughed like drains.
3532 2018-10-30 16:39:33 don't forget Measure G in San Luis Obispo County, banning fracking. Big oil has pouted at least $4 million into this county level race, so that tells you something...
3533 2018-10-30 16:39:21 I was thinking about filling a translucent box with blood colored mineral oil for cooling
3534 2018-10-30 16:39:05 @thenanaaba u have to understand that fact that at least, she should be in a better place than selling red oil. I mean...how is that even possible?
3535 2018-10-30 16:39:00 Itt!! Oil!!
3536 2018-10-30 16:38:59 why doesn't @WholeFoods have a normal tea tree oil shampoo
3537 2018-10-30 16:38:55 And if you want to I know why our oil is so cheap it’s because people such as your self have bought the smear campaign paid for through astroturfing projects ran my Tides Foundation. Which works with New York Hedge Funds that are invested in the U.S. refineries buying our oil..
3538 2018-10-30 16:38:55 Update for order number and items shipped. Received delivery notification on order (CBD oil 28mg) #120,*** yesterday & out for delivery now.

I also noticed my skin is now evenly hydrated my T-zone hasn't been excessively oily hehe & this particular oil is rich in linoleic fatty acids, which are beneficial for acne prone skin

3550 2018-10-30 16:38:00 2/ next thing is to wrap it really well, put it on a plate, and weigh it down with heavy items.  that way, the flavors have time to meld with the oil from the olive salad and the herbs of choice.  after a few hours, it should be *ready* to eat.  don't forget salt and pepper, ...
3551 2018-10-30 16:37:58 Alcune lobbies sono le stesse (ex. big oil, military complex). HRC non e' pulita, ma rispetto a DJT e' una "peach", per cosi' dire.
3552 2018-10-30 16:37:57 Sadly fishing seems to be a tiny clique now. Most islanders had a fisherman, an oil worker & an Arnish worker in their family! They are lucky to have any now.

3585 2018-10-30 16:35:14 Dude I feel your struggle! Last year was the worst for my girls. Go buy a jug of cheap olive oil. Every night before bed slather her entire hair with oil then lice comb it. Every time you run the comb through her hair wipe it on a wipey.

3613 2018-10-30 16:31:19 Look for foundations that have mattifying properties, like the Nyx Cosmetics Stay Matte Not Flat foundation (at Clicks for R150). 
A tip: use a mattifying primer, then set this with a powder. Apply your foundation, then set again with a powder to better control shine & oil

3615 2018-10-30 16:31:12 Right now they should be launching a campaign & challenging government to end children going hungry & homeless at home, end killing & starving them in lands of oil. 

Anything else is PR or BS. Where you definitely are not protecting children, you're supporting the all above.

3632 2018-10-30 16:29:31 For the records, oil price under
PMB is now $85.03 * N361 = N30,695.

 Under GEJ $85.03 * N150 = N12,754 

or $110 * N150 = N16,500.

3634 2018-10-30 16:29:00 If that what u want, you just help Oil lobbyists stay in power, it was Labbyist that lead us to Great Depression not Liberals.
3635 2018-10-30 16:28:54 They can't even make up their mind what to accuse him of! It's Hitler then it's Putins lover but they praise people like merkel too funny Ms Stasi herself. Some guy said he was talking to a billionaire who had a pic of her with KGB and they love their oil..(pt1)
3636 2018-10-30 16:28:50 But if there is a direct return then consumers aren’t affected, oil companies in Canada wont be able to compete with foreign producers. Only way to get a head is to invest in green technology, we will soon be decades behind China relying on them for solutions.

3639 2018-10-30 16:28:26 This is about the relationship between oil and oil stocks, underscoring the new dynamics of secular headwinds. Read the post if you haven't already.
3640 2018-10-30 16:28:25 up to you, do you wanna buy local or support  big oil?
3641 2018-10-30 16:28:23 Where you get your oil changes?
3642 2018-10-30 16:28:13 And full of preservatives. So easy easy easy to mix up. 3:1 oil to vinegar, dab of prepared mustard, tablespoon of fine-chopped onion. Salt and pepper. You can use lemon in place of herbs. Crushed clove of garlic. Herbs. Whatever. It’s also much cheaper.
3643 2018-10-30 16:27:57 they’re coming in to escape from the cold lol i mixed peppermint oil, clear dish soap and water in a spray bottle and sprayed around all my doors/windows bc it’s pet safe and haven’t seen a spider in a week or so and i had been seeing them a lot
3644 2018-10-30 16:27:56 To be clear, you are full of crap. We who care about the environment are talking about the large corporations. Why is looking for new forms of energy such a bad thing? Oil is NOT going to last forever. Let's find alternatives before that happens.
3645 2018-10-30 16:27:50 @daxshepard mercedes self repair question from a guy thats never tried to do work on cars.

3646 2018-10-30 16:27:50 That is correct thus my caveat of from the EPA standpoint. lower RVP gasoline is more expensive. From the state issues some of that comes from the CRCE 67 study Bought and paid for by big Oil

3653 2018-10-30 16:26:58 despite the LT view, ST wasn't oil a bit disconnected with other comm., specially industrials? it seems global growth momentum had turned for a while but oil was the only one not feeling it.

3656 2018-10-30 16:26:14 Dream on. Forty oil has no effect on anything other than those who own v-12 and v-8 cars of which there are a dwindling number.
3657 2018-10-30 16:26:07 Maybe she can ask the Norwegians about their $1tr oil fund rather than trying (far too hard) to make everyone think she's just a regular gal with a crackin sense of humour

3669 2018-10-30 16:25:14 There are much better alternatives but this is why we invest in this and oil exploration, fracking etc
3670 2018-10-30 16:24:48 It’s Irresponsible it got to that point but that has nothing to do with sanctions they mortgaged off the most valuable asset of their money making machine. If they lost Citgo at this point the consequences are worse than oil embargo on exports from vZla.

And also spent uranium shells. You are stealing it's oil & you killed 1000s of civilians in Raqqa. GET OUT.

3681 2018-10-30 16:23:49 Definitely a good article and definitely a snake oil solution. We already have an incredible technology for carbon capture. We know it as the plant kingdom. We simply need to allow it to flourish.

3717 2018-10-30 16:20:25 Yes, virgin coconut oil
3718 2018-10-30 16:20:13 Continental Resources now things that 30-40 billion barrels of oil could be recovered from the Bakken, that's up from its 2011 estimate of 20 billion barrels. "The big difference is technology." $CLR #OOTT
3719 2018-10-30 16:20:10 Hopefully the weekly 50 ma holds it as tired of watching oil fall every day.
3720 2018-10-30 16:19:48 i just don't understand this country sometimes... As if selling oil means you are poor.
wait so they only see people in offices as rich eee..
3721 2018-10-30 16:19:42 Becoz he is not a doctor and has no history of medical and you can't a research for HIV and cancer same time and your findings beats everyone. We know him for anointing oil and fake prophecies.

3727 2018-10-30 16:19:10 I have no doubt that oil and gas companies will find ways around 112 if it passes. That said, I don’t think it passes.

3731 2018-10-30 16:18:56 The article even states it doesn’t not take in to account pipelines. You do understand oil and gas is more than just drilling a well and fracing said well correct? The article also doesn’t take into account that 112 would allow the local government to enforce larger setbacks.

3736 2018-10-30 16:18:34 You do recognise that America would like their Capitalist hands on the oil & are currently doing all they can to undermine, as they have done many many times in that region, or are you just an easily led fool that believes everything ur fed by western propaganda
3737 2018-10-30 16:18:16 Whatever sells. Pass the snake oil.
3738 2018-10-30 16:18:15 It is said that previous party PT stole more than 1,3 Billion Dollars from the Petrobras Oil Company according to a federal police inquiry.

3749 2018-10-30 16:16:54 Genuinely there is no need for it to be oil. We could provide -so- many jobs in the development and upkeep of new energy. Just because it's what we've always done doesn't mean it's best. We evolve and develop, we can evolve here too. And we must, because the alternative is awful.
3750 2018-10-30 16:16:53 I so agree! I found an apple bread recipe online made with white sugar, white flour, vegetable oil; shifted to brown sugar (and less of it), half whole wheat flour, and butter; and it's much more wholesome and I am sure more tasty than the original!

3752 2018-10-30 16:16:35 With the U.S. oil and natural gas market continuing to boom, and production of both rising, FreightWaves’ chief energy analyst Mike Mitchell has written a primer on what happens during the fracking process.

3755 2018-10-30 16:16:27 Oil & Gas have painted 112 as an outright ban on fracking. That is simply untrue.

3765 2018-10-30 16:15:48 Sticking up for a country that wants to wipe Israel off the map, eh? Isn’t that anti-Semitic? On 1978 the USA froze Iran’s assets after they stole our money by nationalizing all our oil companies. Did Obama ask for the US money back when he gave Iran $150B for nothing in return?
3766 2018-10-30 16:15:37 I see Trump is incapable of learning from his mistakes and is further trying to divide our country. This snake oil salesman does not care about you, me or this country.

3771 2018-10-30 16:14:53 When I did my grad school project on Lucas Oil Stadium, Matt was one of my interview subjects and could not have been more gracious with his time and knowledge of the project.
3772 2018-10-30 16:14:48 It’s a much older practice than the media makes it out to be. When I was student engineer in West Texas oil field in 1991, we did both fracking jobs (one-time opening up formation by adding expansion chemicals) and constant water injection (for daily increased production).

3774 2018-10-30 16:14:28 Saudi Arabia is a strategic and geopolitical ally, not a natural ally.  There is no better alternative in a country full of religious fanatics and it was the Saudi cooperation that prevented another oil crisis since 1970s, they subsidize US arms industry and partnered in wars

3783 2018-10-30 16:13:50 To overcome steadfast oil industry opposition you need to raise revenue and spend it on constituencies who will bring folks to the ballot. Revenue-raising investment programs will offer direct benefits to voters to make up for higher consumer costs of a carbon fee.

3807 2018-10-30 16:11:46 Perhaps you have seen plastic in old documentaries e.g. from second world war in scenes of officers wear cap with plastic visor. Plastic did not exist that time. It is invented late 60's and became time of Tupperware. Plastic is super cheap to produce from fossil fuel, oil.
3808 2018-10-30 16:11:30 yes. inspire young entrepreneurs to scale up technologies discarded by prototype building scientists. sell that to an oil company executive. putting an oil company out of business is the single, simplest, most effective, fastest, way to build incentive for growth.

3837 2018-10-30 16:08:53 US fracking industry has produced oil and gas but has NEVER produced profits. Between 2010 and 2017 33 fracking companies spent $196bn more on projects than they made selling oil and gas.  Ask Claire Perry why we will do better and who will pay if we do not.
3838 2018-10-30 16:08:46 Nestle also needs to revamp their recipes to use ingredients other than palm oil.
3839 2018-10-30 16:08:32 What about thc oil?  Folks want both.  Methinks #htfse will be popular at less than the cost of indoor flower per gram.  I'm only pessimistic about the future of commercial indoor production because I'm realistic about outdoor-inclusive reg reality.

3901 2018-10-30 16:01:44 I have said all along they will sell oil
3902 2018-10-30 16:01:43 Aloe Vera! I used it when the baby would have her flare ups. I also switched her to all sensitive skin products. It helped her with the dry patches she would get. After her bath I use organic coconut oil baby lotion. I’ll check if I still have some at the house & take it to you.

3913 2018-10-30 16:01:01 I'm very glad to hear this, as they make one of the few light spreads that doesn't have palm oil.
3914 2018-10-30 16:00:56 what is USO? Some type of oil etf?
3915 2018-10-30 16:00:53 Nah, she cares about her district, that's why she voted no to keep a swindler from doing business there. She knows a snake oil salesman when she sees one. You're just so desperate you don't see the snake in the grass. You have a USL team next year but don't want to play by rules.
3916 2018-10-30 16:00:52 I'd quite like to try CBD (pref oil form) any tips on where to start?

3918 2018-10-30 16:00:40 I think they can knock you off abit , especially the thc oil. But I believe you do get used to it. Can’t talk on a personal experience. But do know guys who have had it

3925 2018-10-30 16:00:16 I wish @BloombergTV would be clear when it talks about oil whether its WTI or Brent especially when you might assume that BP might reference the Brent price as a UK Company

3929 2018-10-30 16:00:00 Again, I think she was. But it’s an issue of audience. If she’s writing to the Conservative party types, downtown Calgary, etc that are saying “we need more ethical oil comma strategy” (which is what many were doing at the event she is talking about) her message is don’t.
3930 2018-10-30 15:59:40 I’ve been using my vape, the numbers must be different for the oil cartridges lol
3931 2018-10-30 15:59:14 They have to deal with market forces just like every other business.  They will have to eat at least some of this fee.  Time will tell how much.

We don’t have time to wait on getting off oil dependence.  Impacts happening now and 2040 is coming fast.
3932 2018-10-30 15:59:08 I just wish this was reported earlier. Ive known about HZ drilling for years growing up with gas wells on my property, but most people dont know anything about oil and gas. HZ drilling has been used for a long time to access reserves under parks, homes, fed land, schools, etc.
3933 2018-10-30 15:58:49 The fact that somebody signed a piece of paper two continents away does not  constitute Iran no to sell its oil. The world is laughing at US in talking these kind of nonsense.
3934 2018-10-30 15:58:49 They still put baby oil on that ball
3935 2018-10-30 15:58:36 Oil, it’s pretty toxic

3943 2018-10-30 15:57:27 I mean, it will definitely be olive oil.

3952 2018-10-30 15:56:22 Now there's a clever notion. We can put the caravan on cruise ships and take them to Canada, or if they really want to be in the US, we can take them up to Alaska and let them work on the new oil rigs going into ANWAR.
3953 2018-10-30 15:56:20 if i was a duck, covered in oil from the puny humans around me. would you cleanse my body and make me new?
3954 2018-10-30 15:56:19 Brush with olive oil, season to taste, stick a clove of garlic in the hole and microwave for 4 seconds.
3955 2018-10-30 15:56:06 Texas Tea will be the topic when the @CNBCFuturesNow team joins the @HalftimeReport at 1240pm --Is the slide for oil over ---what are the levels to watch --we break it all down #oott #crude
3956 2018-10-30 15:55:54 It’s a bit hypocritical don’t you think? They have no problem with the American govt who dropped bombs on Hiroshima who sells guns to the Saudi who buy oil from the Saudi who fight an endless number of wars without justification who kill civilians every day

3958 2018-10-30 15:55:45 if one thinks in terms of protecting themselves from a dollar collapse, naturally gold and silver, after that oil, natural gas, commodities etc. seems quite inflationary
3959 2018-10-30 15:55:34 So you're saying that there is a global conspiracy where a group of politicians has been paying the vast majority of the scientistific community across the globe for decades to say that climate change is happening? Even though the oil industry is the largest political donor?
3960 2018-10-30 15:55:26 Sorry, but BPCL has no upstream facilities as far as I know of. I mean they are purely into refining. They don't have any licence or skill to drill oil wells. What am I missing?
3961 2018-10-30 15:55:23 @PatriotsforMI where do you stand on Line 5?  Do you believe there is a place for oil pipelines under, or inside the Great Lakes? My vote is riding on this single answer.
3962 2018-10-30 15:55:20 I really hate being single, when I freeze my butt of checking & filling up the fluids (antifreeze, oil etc) & putting gas in my truck. Otherwise, I dont miss it. Is that bad?
3963 2018-10-30 15:55:16 Olive Oil and Honey lagg raha Hai :P
3964 2018-10-30 15:55:15 Cheap shot. . How much of the current reserve is debt/euro bonds? FYI despite high oil prices enjoyed by the IOCs they all had major issues when proceed fell. Think about it for a minute. The answers lie in macroeconomic theory....

3974 2018-10-30 15:54:34 I’m hardcore conservative, but every senior oil and gas executive should have to have a disposal well in their front yard.
3975 2018-10-30 15:54:29 Using Creed perfume oil from @dejokecarew & it's just 2k. I smell good all day
3976 2018-10-30 15:54:28 Mexico is our number 2 Trading partner and in the top 4 oil exporters to the US and their minimum wage is $5 a day so that Americans can drive cars that are primarily made in Mexico
Politicians both Mexico and the US should forced these companies to pay the workers American wage

3979 2018-10-30 15:54:24 No. I use gel cleansers. However, these are the oil cleansers. The first step of my night routine.
3980 2018-10-30 15:54:14 Where has all the Oil money gone ?
3981 2018-10-30 15:54:09 @JohnJamesMI where do you stand on Line 5?  Do you believe there is a place for oil pipelines under, or inside the Great Lakes? My vote is riding on this single answer.

3983 2018-10-30 15:54:06 Some people hunt or food, I come from a tribe and they still hunt wild game. It's actually less of an environmental impact than ranching.

3987 2018-10-30 15:53:52 The cold truth is that you are the very definition of “entitled, bitter old white dude”. You’ve made a career out of lies and exploitation. In 1800, they would have called you “snake oil salesman”

3998 2018-10-30 15:53:11 What if the countries where these ships come from don’t need anything from us? What can we sell to them that they don’t have apart from oil? This issue is a big reason to worry
3999 2018-10-30 15:53:02 #ukog two tankers a day for weeks over 50ty spotted lots more missed what the hell have we got in the weald basin. #angus share getting taken by the millions and we have just seen gear arrive on site. The biggest oil strike in the UK onshore? #ukgov cut the red tape
4000 2018-10-30 15:53:00 When I get back to Jacksonville I gotta get my oil changed and car washed. I’ll handle that next Tuesday
4001 2018-10-30 15:52:55 Too little too late. Too many other products on the market that make their butters taste like five year old used motor oil.

4005 2018-10-30 15:52:45 I don't think that could be applied to humans.
Canola oil mice also gained more weight, probably, that's confounder.
4006 2018-10-30 15:52:32 By "his medicine" you mean his snake oil, right?
4007 2018-10-30 15:52:23 Are you in a legal state?  Your better with some oil if you don't smoke.  I sleep like a baby, thanks to the right strain, no after effects. If that doesnt fly, go to pharmacy and get melatonin, cheap and works.  Good luck 
4008 2018-10-30 15:52:23 Oh really ...are we so bad?? Where is the $1 trill earned from oil.. So we are just using it to buy rice

4012 2018-10-30 15:52:05 It is . I just added a lil oil and onions for more seasoning

4017 2018-10-30 15:51:37 What's wrong with Simpson engaging in Palm Oil business? She could not be athlete her entire life. We have to respect what she does. It sounds to me that, we're disrespecting oil sellers
4018 2018-10-30 15:51:09 $/CL oil futures possible low of the cycle.   Above the 200 am n u will see shorts cover .
4019 2018-10-30 15:51:01 Especially now that Obama has removed any donation limit from private entities. The "power to the people" factor is in bad shape in the US. When the state is big yet funded by taxes and rules by elected, it's still more people power than when it's IT or oil funded MP.
4020 2018-10-30 15:50:53 we been around top4 for 10 yrs now. Saw oil money pour in. But we have improved every season. This debt is nothing. We just signed a Nike kit deal till 2033. Naming rights yet to be done. There is so many new revenue opportunity created. My only worry is the team investment
4021 2018-10-30 15:50:51 The point is, AB bitumen is always going to be the most expensive oil on the market, just by its very nature (i.e. its physical/chemical composition). It was very viable with triple digit prices, and we're just not there anymore.
4022 2018-10-30 15:50:44 ぼったくり。普通に進撃でええ

4026 2018-10-30 15:50:18 my poor friend. The day somebody unplugged my wallflower and plugged it back in upside down and all the oil drained out was the last straw. I flashed tf out on everybody do you hear me.
4027 2018-10-30 15:50:11 Climate change is the battle of our lives for our lives and it's directly linked to how powerless we are economically. Tax the oil Barron fix our world.
4028 2018-10-30 15:49:55 Ever try jojoba oil?  Really absorbs well to prevent flaky skin and is especially helpful here in the mountains of Southwest New Mexico where we've seen humidity as low as 4%.
4029 2018-10-30 15:49:26 They stole the gold, still steeling the oil and making money by steeling the artifacts as well
4030 2018-10-30 15:49:19 Scotland has no oil either the rights for them were sold to England over 20 years ago. Scotland gets more money than it contributes.

4) apple cider vinegar & honey


4036 2018-10-30 15:48:49 wouldn't cheer to enthusiastically over a Chicago economist running the show; oil selloff needs tough scruples to avoid corruption (not that it avoided that under the state, mind) and experimental variant didn't exactly benefit Chile's economy in the 80s...

4041 2018-10-30 15:47:58 "One thing I've noticed is that kids who used to do ice curls are the ones who makes it in life cause all of that excess oil in their scalps acted as a lubricant to further enhance their thinking capacity"

4050 2018-10-30 15:47:26 الخبر: السعودية تتنازل عن اكثر من 6 مليار دولار لصالح دول فقيرة.
لماذا لا يستشار المواطنين في مثل هذه القرارات ؟
6 مليار دولار = 30 مليار ريال من أموالنا لو استثمرت ستخلق كم وظيفة ، تبني كم بيت ؟
لماذا التفريط في أموال الوطن؟!  #السعودية

4059 2018-10-30 15:46:33 Why don’t we concentrate on getting the AB oil patch back on track? Foreign investment, a pipeline? So we’re not giving our oil away? Getting people back to work in YYC just might be good for the city’s economy as well!!
4060 2018-10-30 15:46:23 Hi @TheBodyShopUK will you be re-stocking the tea tree oil flawless BB Cream? Been looking for it in stores for ages and it's no longer on your website, has it been discontinued?

4065 2018-10-30 15:45:41 Oooh, I grilled this last summer and added a bruschetta topping of chopped tomatoes, smidge of red onion & garlic, basil, olive oil, salt after my grill marks were set. It was the bomb.

4070 2018-10-30 15:45:18 An avowedly socialist economy and society isn't the answer either. Brazilians saw how that reduced Venezuela, a country with the biggest oil reserves in the world, to a failed state and created a refugee crisis to rival Syria.

4084 2018-10-30 15:43:51 Standing firm on Iran oil import despite US sanction is assertive India on world stage.  Kudos to @PMOIndia n @arunjaitley.
4085 2018-10-30 15:43:45 I felt the argument was more "if we need oil to 'survive' might as well use the oil sands". But I think it's also a piece that is targeted at the Albertans that feel like a comms "War Room" promoting AB oil is just what we need get pipelines. That's a different audience than you.
4086 2018-10-30 15:43:45 We need the cooking oil in shops and also with reasonable prices for the poor to afford also. Imagine those in rural areas. Can they afford those exorbitant prices for basics?
4087 2018-10-30 15:43:40 @1a prop 112 in colorado is one of the things that lead me to vote early. It pushes back oil and gas development from 500 ft to 2500 ft. Unfortunately the oil companies are spending millions of dollars and twisting the facts to mislead voters. #nomorefracking

4090 2018-10-30 15:43:27 If PM Selfie Socks had any acumen (), he'd champion Canadian oil as "Fem-oil" to go along with his Feminist budget.
4091 2018-10-30 15:43:17 You seem to be ignoring CIA interference and sanctions in your rush to blame socialism. Coupled with huge oil reserves. Can't think why the US wanted to interfere...

4093 2018-10-30 15:42:55 Scotland's 2.5 million employed do the same jobs for the same companies as Ireland's 2 million employed yet Scotland's economy (with oil) is 1/3 less than Ireland's.

The only thing these figures show us every year is the cost of the union and its no cheap.
4094 2018-10-30 15:42:55 You are a complete and total liar and we know it! We are going to pay more for absolutely EVERYTHING that has oil or fuel required to produce it. Stop thinking we are dense! Congratulations you are forcing more limited income pensioners out of their home! Heat or eat

4101 2018-10-30 15:42:25 No, the dealer needs 5 days to repair the oil leak the engine has to be taken apart. No supervisor from Chrysler will even speak to me. Time to take action against Chrysler. Maybe then they will speak to me.
4102 2018-10-30 15:42:22 Good luck with your top up Adrian...well done.

4104 2018-10-30 15:41:41 Please read this and I am sure you will appreciate how oil companies were ransacked by the ThugNasty led government. It is like I borrow for fooling my parents my family and then put the onus of repayment on my next generation
4105 2018-10-30 15:41:40 @Lagostalks913 I wud have tot dat our excess crude account wud b very robust now since oil price has been rising

4112 2018-10-30 15:41:20 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
4113 2018-10-30 15:41:15 It’s also about where u live. It’s not gonna be the same price everywhere. Inflation is important. Cali will be more expensive than Arkansas so it’s not important. He also just wants American oil not foreign
4114 2018-10-30 15:41:06 What kinda,car an do you see any oil in the drive way where you park
4115 2018-10-30 15:41:04 Peppermint essential oil on your temples, lots of water, and a warm cloth over your eyes
4116 2018-10-30 15:40:49 

My favorite was being on a little commuter prop plane and takeoff was delayed so someone could run out with a can of oil and top off the starboard engine. Swear there was duct tape on the inside of the engine cowling, too.

4127 2018-10-30 15:40:09 All we can do is fight for some fat old man who is using us to get oil or some other shit. Everything is just a game to rich people

4131 2018-10-30 15:39:56 it depends the type of oil you talking about 
4132 2018-10-30 15:39:53 Bio oil.  Works for scars on my face too.
4133 2018-10-30 15:39:34 Powdered coconut oil & powdered bone broth will be on my sled.
4134 2018-10-30 15:39:24 The media will not tell you the truth in the headlines.  The money was not remitted during 16 years reign of PDP...especially the year the world recorded the highest fraud in the world oil industry under GEJ and during the oil boom.
4135 2018-10-30 15:39:16 You talking bout getting the oil wagon for the train robbery?
4136 2018-10-30 15:39:15 I actually think the increase in #angs too will make some people look at both players more now #ukog
4137 2018-10-30 15:39:07 Kena guna banyak² la jugak lepas ni. Nanti boleh try oil cleansing yg lain pulak 
4138 2018-10-30 15:39:06 Pollution was never an issue prior to recent years.

Correct, yes. They kept innovating past Model Ts. So, why stop now? Why not keep going? Why not offer incentives to keep them innovating? Companies want to switch to electrics and hybrids, but oil is remaining overtly dominant.
4139 2018-10-30 15:38:59 Pure until the vows. Then the sin will infect me like the BP oil spill ravaging the gulf
4140 2018-10-30 15:38:58 I took my car in for an oil change and headlights and...they aren't telling me I should have anything else done... Is this real life?
4141 2018-10-30 15:38:55 name 100 activists who do this and yet do not benefit in some way by the use of the pipes they so vehemently decry.  Oil, gas, sewer, water...  Unless you want to live like jungle people in the Amazon, your life is not a reflection of such radical beliefs.
4142 2018-10-30 15:38:44 112 does not keep Firestone from happening again. It prevents new development from being closer than 2500 ft but does not eliminate new homes,schools, or parks from being built dangerously close to existing oil and gas development.
4143 2018-10-30 15:38:34 Beautiful work again Michael son. I hope you didn’t get that new @BigWipes jacket dirty playing with that horrible oil
4144 2018-10-30 15:37:59 The Donald @realDonaldTrump is a reality TV star. He is one of the very best salesmen, marketing experts, and purveyor of snake oil I have known. Amazing how people demanding the Constitution be followed the previous eight years are cheering this conman on today. #MAGA
4145 2018-10-30 15:37:57 I know you are and I love you for it. Ingesting the oil makes a dog unable to walk, that is why he can't walk, it also coats the intestines and destroys tissue. I am not sure of the cures for this, but the Vet may be able to save him. I know you are doing everything you can.
4146 2018-10-30 15:37:48 One of my cats loves fruit. Melon, Kiwis, blueberries, apple banana lychee peach nectarines mango and coconut oil.

4149 2018-10-30 15:37:39 Not much of a prediction. I believe when referring to past and current events the phase is "stating the obvious".
4150 2018-10-30 15:37:28 @NaturesUltra CBD Oil was originally recommended to me from friend who knew bad neck pain I had. It took yrs of pain away–that I couldn’t fix w/drs+chiropractors. I’ve learned #CBDOilsArentAllAlike It’s pharmaceutical grade, organic, no THC=drug tests negative for work. #Best

4154 2018-10-30 15:37:20 It doesn't surprise me,if WM sent £10bn, to help out, 
The SNP Govt, of Glasgow, would say it wasn't enough, or it didn't make up, for all oor oil, past 715yr, nor clearances! It's a shame for people/businesses, who've suffered -but, blame, 2 Salitres, grievance monger Sturgeon!
4155 2018-10-30 15:37:19 @charliebighams just bought your salmon en croute, wish I'd read ingredients beforehand.  Palm oil?? Why??
4156 2018-10-30 15:37:16 But if we stop getting our oil from Saudi Arabia that sends a message that Canada is islamaphobic
4157 2018-10-30 15:36:37 Wow just talk real fast and people will think you know what you are talking about right Candace? Holy crap you are the embarrassing one! Only the republican party can make black people forget their past so easily! Snake oil!

4160 2018-10-30 15:36:16 Unfortunately, yes. Apparently an EZ-Go cart needed some ventilation in the crankcase. Happened about 10 minutes after I left on Saturday. Gotta love a blown engine that has the correct amount of oil in it.
4161 2018-10-30 15:36:10 I think you're forgetting about the country you're going to this week where Women are not allowed to wrestle, Sami Zayn wasn't allowed to wrestle and in general the whole murdering an innocent man not long ago thing.

but sure, erase hate
unless given copious amounts of oil money

4163 2018-10-30 15:36:01 What about fish oil or cooking oil before sex toys?
4164 2018-10-30 15:35:50 A few weeks back oil traded to 75.00 quarter figure and saw a retrace,net from there. Then in your MMSP we see it above that. Highly overbought. Nice setup.
4165 2018-10-30 15:35:43 This is oil money, bruh, go big or go home -- and it's a long flight. Five million. And a cabinet position. Secretary of Maggots, yeah, that'll do.
4166 2018-10-30 15:35:43 I am not cabinet material. I run an oil mill in Nkulumane, Bulawayo
4167 2018-10-30 15:35:36 Best CV format i have ever seen
4168 2018-10-30 15:35:14 I honestly don’t know if we can stem it. Snake oil salesmen have existed for hundreds of years..as long as there are people who are disenchanted with the mainstream system and looking for a quick fix, diets like this will continue. Maddening!
4169 2018-10-30 15:34:48 Jiffy Lube is so trash

but like.. I welcome that trash into my life by not just changing my own oil.
4170 2018-10-30 15:34:30 Thomas, Dor will rerate when the oil is sold. Thats why brockham is so important now with horse hill production after. Cash is king, especially lots of it.
4171 2018-10-30 15:34:20 You have said my analysis (it wasn't an analysis) was laughable & yet haven't reasonably argued for why it's laughable.....you have only referred to one single factor (oil) and made no references to anything else
4172 2018-10-30 15:34:17 Health and safety? If drilling 500ft away from homes, parks etc. is dangerous for health and safety. Then why is building new homes, schools and parks closer than 500ft from existing oil and gas development safe and healthy? This doesn’t solve anything health or safety related

4177 2018-10-30 15:33:50 I use that to tan too!! This chick legit meant to scoop out coconut oil and slather it on for daily protection... someone warned her against it and she's like "someone else told me and I never bothered to research" 
4178 2018-10-30 15:33:45 Terminate the Fed, issue own currency, interest free. Confiscate all what these savage stole. This is the first step to make America great again. The second step is to destroy existing communist system structure by applying our anti-trust laws to all monopolies: media, drug, oil.

4181 2018-10-30 15:33:16 $WRD selling to $CHK in a mostly stock deal, at a valuation well below the recent trading range, headed into a bullish oil environment, suggests to me WRD knows their asset isn’t scalable (al la Terryville) and it’s time to run for the exit before that is indisputably clear.

4186 2018-10-30 15:32:37 @realDonaldTrump is a reality TV star. He is one of the very best salesmen, marketing experts, and purveyor of snake oil I have known. Amazing how people demanding the Constitution be followed the previous eight years are cheering this conman on today. #MAGA
4187 2018-10-30 15:32:34 I prefer my salt brine soaked almonds that i roast in the oven, then coat in a dash of oil and salt.
Can't beat that with a microwave :p
4188 2018-10-30 15:32:33 At the peak of oil earnings between  $110-$120 per barrel," Nigeria External Reserves fall from May 2010: US$38.8 billion to US$29.6 billion May 2015. We still borrow to pay salaries. 

These are the issues they are avoiding but they must answer us!
4189 2018-10-30 15:32:32 Hi, Mare! Thanks for reaching out to us! 
We are redoing the striping because the contractor striped it before the shoulders were sealed.  When the shoulders were sealed they sprayed oil onto the white edge line so when we inspected the project and let the contractor know. (1/2)

4192 2018-10-30 15:32:17 My mom is an oil seller,she used her profit to take care of me and some cousins through tertiary education, she has even employed some people and made properties out of it.. In all there's nothing wrong with selling oil.. Determination is the main key

4213 2018-10-30 15:30:11 Read Your Bible - Proverbs 27:15–16

15 A continual dripping on a rainy day and a contentious woman are alike; 16 to restrain her is to restrain the wind or to grasp oil in his right hand.
4214 2018-10-30 15:30:11 Mostly anxiety but i noticed it helps with my TMJ a LOT that’s super painful I can barely move my neck when it hits me. I like the vape more than the oil as I feel it has a better and faster effect
4215 2018-10-30 15:30:05 Yes it will be sweet, crude, and oily.. I can see ukog hitting 10p in 2019 if not before.
4216 2018-10-30 15:29:58 There are sponges being made that are able to absorb all the oil in water! Oil spills contaminate our water and make a significant amount of water unable to drink. These sponges (made from wood) are able to selectively take out the oil. @hydrochrista #waterinthenews

4220 2018-10-30 15:29:20 Chicken Italia because it's so unique and makes a delicious dish with Brussels sprouts (yes really), parmesan and orecchiette pasta. You make the sausages into meatballs, fry with the Brussels until golden, then toss with the cooked pasta, olive oil, parmesan and chilli flakes!
4221 2018-10-30 15:29:19 The grocery wasn't identified. But yeah, a lot of groceries & stores do it from time to time like Divali, Xmas, Carnival or for certain products alcohol, electronics, olive oil. Dunno who put out story, but I woulda sue

4242 2018-10-30 15:27:27 I thought the recent IMF predictions for world gdp were very pessimistic 

however the recent turmoil in emerging mkts and currency headwinds with strength of dollar and oil have highlighted some significant growth concerns.

The Tariffs being introduced by Trump huge factor

4252 2018-10-30 15:26:37 Yes, i do, in both.   No, i don't think high CBD varieties are more suitable for outdoor growth, it's simply what the market will dictate based on the desire for CBD oil.  Patients who know, don't want outdoor pollinated flowers for smoking. best quality comes from reduced inputs
4253 2018-10-30 15:26:23 I drive too much  I need an oil change every month and a half to two months

4307 2018-10-30 15:21:01 They increased borrowing by $10bn whether you like or not. Stop wallowing in derision.....if you wanna stay in $ lane do, or # lane na your wahala. Albeit, Nigeria is 80% oil$ earning economy, the more oil prices go up, the more $ capacity to do stuffs.....maybe, stealing too.
4308 2018-10-30 15:20:54 Whether my teeth smell like cat urine after 3 months of me drinking truffle oil instead of water or not is just chemicals in the brain

4326 2018-10-30 15:19:28 We have huge crude oil deposits but we sleep at the petrol stations waiting for petrol. We are a major gas producer but we do not have electricity. We have a huge land mass, good vegetation & good weather but we import food. We have huge deposits of bitumen in several states
4327 2018-10-30 15:19:16 Matter of time before #China, #India, & others buy #oil in other foreign #currencies like #renminbi?

Will be a watershed of inevitable fall of #America dollar as reserve currency and rise in #Asia as a trading and #commodities center?

Reforms still necessary, but inevitable?

After getting my car’s front end fixed, new battery, new alternator, new temperature guage & gaskets; yesterday my car broke down because I’ve been burning oil from an internal leak somewhere in the valves. Cars cost so much money 
4336 2018-10-30 15:18:26 What sucks about Freddy working in the oil field is that we can never make plans  and he won’t be home for every holiday and that I don’t see him for days/weeks at a time. And I barely talk to him through out the day considering he works 14 hours shifts.
4337 2018-10-30 15:18:17 If I could have slept earlier this wouldn’t have been a problem 
4338 2018-10-30 15:18:12 I’m definitely going to try that supplement. I’ve been trying the lavender essential oil and it does nothing :(

4346 2018-10-30 15:17:20 I was considering just buying a new car  I hate having to get the oil changed.

4360 2018-10-30 15:16:14 When you were writing this you actually thought it made sense abi? At May 2015 oil price was $68 and fx rate N198, today oil is $77 and fx rate is N305. You still want to compare? Go and check Naira value of FIRS receipts now vs then....come back when you are better informed.
4361 2018-10-30 15:16:09 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, or substantive conversation.

4449 2018-10-30 15:07:08 Brodda, don't complicate issues. Ok let's do it this way. Calculate everything ; Debt value, Tax revenues, crude oil receipts and all govt receivables converted to Naira as at May 2015 and now and let's compare... and you will still see that we are way better off now than then.

They don’t have Refinery Plants. 
They usually import extremely good oil made by Japan.

4457 2018-10-30 15:06:03 The power cuts were during Heath's term. The strikes were due to high inflation and wages not keeping up due to the oil price shock.

4467 2018-10-30 15:05:14 I'm a big fan of $CCX.TO at these levels. Spread betwen $WCS and $WTI has to tighten. I know there are challenges in the $WCS market, but not this much. #Crude #Oil #OOTT
4468 2018-10-30 15:05:14 Seems like an appropriate way to invest infrastructure funds. But taxing energy; adding regulatory complications so that future pipeline approvals can never happen; and welcoming tanker after tanker of imported oil is simply two-faced, wrong, and anti-Canadian.

4470 2018-10-30 15:04:47 Today I realized how much @jiffylube is ripping folks off. I may be late but talk about a HUGE rip off. So thankful I’ve found a local auto shop that charges half of what they do for oil changes. Jiffy won’t be getting ANY business from me.

4507 2018-10-30 15:01:04 Your Guest analogy that in 1999, we didn't 'borrow more like we are borrowing now' is an attempt to over trivialize the issue of borrowing; Borrowing is interpreted on the Basis of Capital Project being executed & not entirely on profit generated on Oil.

4524 2018-10-30 14:59:58 What does the great Lakes have to do with the red tide in Florida,  in my opinon the red tide has nothing to do with the great Lakes and everything to do with the BP oil spill. Also the Presadent's father years ago has nothing to do with ither.

4527 2018-10-30 14:59:32 "FREE"   advice for your health ! Take Flax seed oil everyday because it   has more omega 3's than omega 6's.  Omega 3's  inhibit inflammation,   whereas omega 6's increase inflammation.  Fish and fish oils contain    more omega 3's but they may also contain mercury or radiation.
4528 2018-10-30 14:59:31 Ideally suitable for irrigation of closely spaced crops like sugarcane, vegetables, oil seeds, onions, potato, fodder, cereals, etc.
Suitable for landscape and turf irrigation.
Recommended for irrigation in irregular / undulating terrain and hilly areas.

4551 2018-10-30 14:55:12 Tell that to Westminster! Scotland has been trying to leave but WM Red/Blue tory intevention, ie 'Not just now' means we have to wait till WM decides they don't need our revenue & oil anymore. Double standards...
4552 2018-10-30 14:54:47 Not entirely true. In USMCA countries only Canada will have a CO2 tax and we don't penalize goods in those countries coming to Canada. Then we have oil imports on the east coast from a variety of countries all of which have no CO2 tax and fewer regulations. We're run by morons.
4553 2018-10-30 14:54:36 The road to fulfillment of PURPOSE will get a little difficult at times but it should never be a struggle because of the oil and the grace that God releases to get it done!!!

4559 2018-10-30 14:53:48 Yep, I’m critical of the Maduro regime, it’s not even socialist in any real sense. It had some radical social democratic policies under Chavez that halved poverty & improved conditions.Economy in pvt hands increased. Bad management&reliance on oil made it vulnerable to markets.
4560 2018-10-30 14:53:41 Pure African Shea for now although sometimes I blend a butter with Shea and raw cocoa butter and an oil. Also been trying LOTION! Suave has a Shea/cocoa butter mix that’s the best thing I’ve used in years.   but you know that already.

4571 2018-10-30 14:52:19 It's simple.  Heat your olive oil and cook the sardines in oil (don't drain the oil). They'll dissolve in the olive oil.  Add garlic and crushed red peppers to taste.  I also fry bread crumbs in oil and crushed peppers (until dark dark brown) as a topping.
4572 2018-10-30 14:52:17 It’s simps - don’t be mean with the oil

4579 2018-10-30 14:51:12 Exactly, please tell them and introduce a bill to stop them. This government is either borrowing money or selling national assets. What’s happening to the oil revenues, recovered loots money, tax revenues and customs duties. Some people are being disingenuous with our money
4580 2018-10-30 14:51:09 So when @CPC_HQ gives huge breaks to big oil and gas with SR&ED that was allocated for innovation in manufacturing in Ontario it is ok, but ... oh god please stop this hypocrisy
4581 2018-10-30 14:50:59 so your taxes subsidize giant corps, both foreign and domestic, in the tar sand, oil sands, oil and mining bizes...and that isn't reflected in the pricing to consumers...so perhaps you  should consider taking up some of your beef up with them???

4740 2018-10-30 14:33:51 Oh I definitely use the blender with the coconut oil! It's great, it's like a latte.

I got a flavored almond milk creamer, I'm not sold on it, but I also use the blender with it.

Maybe if I have another cup.

4745 2018-10-30 14:33:21 You're cracking my white ass up 
I use olive oil mostly instead of lotion, but what really absorbs and lasts a long time is almond oil. Buy it in the food stores though, as heath food places are crazy with the prices and organic labels for something you're not even eating

I hope this was helpful and not intrusive. If so i apologize.

Additionally, not at all happy about bill for 2 oil changes in 7 months/8k miles approx. Is it normal for a circa £650 service bill in the first year of ownership?!

4811 2018-10-30 14:25:17 @JoanneGJoseph fuel prices are high mainly because of global oil prices and the weakness of the Rand. Government cannot do anything instantaneous about either factor, and so this fuel war consumer boycott has no hope of suceeding. Fuel taxes are only part of our problem.

4846 2018-10-30 14:20:53 For me, this is why rapidly shifting consumer demand is key.  People fearmonger about 'destroying the economy' but economy has subsystems.  I would gladly destroy oil & gas industry & factoryfarming while creating jobs and investment in renewables and sustainable farming.
4847 2018-10-30 14:20:47 The strategies of oil industry lobbying have become absolutely pervasive in how narratives are inveigled into the media, how influence seeps through the discourse.

5020 2018-10-30 14:04:22 If your talking about Syria, the war in Syria right is the fault of the US after a  massively failed attempt at a coo by the CIA to bring down the government there because they wouldn't let them run an oil pipeline through Syria.
5021 2018-10-30 14:04:12 I’m about to teach myself to do an oil change because I literally dread going there and sitting in my car. Like the guys are all nice, but I guess I just don’t like conversing.. or people? Idk.

5023 2018-10-30 14:03:47 Despite this month’s volatility, oil prices are still up more than 11% for the year. The selling has been driven more by momentum than supply-demand, so crude prices could quickly jump higher if U.S. sanctions against Iran and other disruptions lead to a supply shortfall.
5024 2018-10-30 14:03:36 I increasingly think the era of global hysterical polarization is only *partially* attributable to the growth of the internet. Much of the rest of the causes, I think, can mostly be attributed to the global oil industry.

5027 2018-10-30 14:03:19 Sometimes I think of weird things, like right now I am considering dropping my car off for an oil change and running around the area, but Im thinking maybe not so good in the International Mall/Doral area for running safely lol
5028 2018-10-30 14:03:13 You've gotta get spooky. Like, scared shitless tomorrow because it's halloween. My suggestion?
Before work, get a pot full of oil and put it on the burner on the stove. Set it to the lowest setting. Then, put a couple of ice cubes in it. Then, go to work. You'll be scared all day

5056 2018-10-30 14:01:08 The skepticism in hedge funds has been reinforced by another bearish signal in the oil market. The price of oil to be delivered in the future is now higher than the spot price, a condition known as contango where the futures price of a commodity is above the expected spot price.

5208 2018-10-30 13:46:35 Yes, but lots of it will end up as oil used by humans with the waste fed to livestock. The oil is a small part of the bean so "mostly fed to livestock" is in itself disingenuous. The Guardian quote claiming deforestisation was purely to grow soya for animal feed is plain lies.

5227 2018-10-30 13:45:49 Could be big oil with tax/petrodollars too. Note how they keep value of total short close to $10b over years. They will just write it off as lost either way, the goal is likely inhibiting speed of tesla growth by making access to capital harder.
5228 2018-10-30 13:45:44 You seems to have forgotten that under GEJ with high oil prices, they were still borrowing to pay salaries instead of using it to build infrastructure. Now with low oil prices, FG is borrowing to fund infrastructure instead of using it to pay salaries. So who is a better manager?

However, btw 2015 -2018, our debt imcreased by $10bn, and we have REAL PROJECTS everywhere.

5264 2018-10-30 13:42:35 The level of hype is unsustainable, and the lack of good test cases makes the "any time now" crowd seem like they're peddling snake oil. My own guess is that a few viable cases will emerge, but the hype will die down

5277 2018-10-30 13:40:57 No, says something about top of cycle always looking cheap. One thing oil bulls don't understand: oil can drop to match valuations just as easily as valuations can go up to match a high oil price. I've called for the former for months now.

5280 2018-10-30 13:40:51 Quick story: I grew up in Baltimore in a house that was built in 1920. Previous owners (and neighborhood) had been Jewish. There was even a mezuzah on the front and back doors...
 Anyways, there was a large oil painting that had been built into the dining room wall
5281 2018-10-30 13:40:43 We should expose retailers who are overcharging, it's daylight robbery. Spar Kamfinsa, which as residents operates like a tuckshop, is one such. Imagine shield roll-on is $7,79, Dettol soap $4.85, Colgate $5,22, locally produced cooking oil $6,99 and 5 litre water +$4, Sugar +$4.
5282 2018-10-30 13:40:32 I'd like to see the 'evidence' that saturated fat causes heart disease. How can a natural fat, that we evolved eating, be less healthy than an industrially processed oil?

5316 2018-10-30 13:36:38 The question is, will it use carbon neutral hydrogen or hydrogen as a by-product of the oil industry? All of these processes also consume a lot of energy. Metal particulates from exhaust is more problematic (worse than diesel) as hydrogen engines consume a lot of lubricating oil.
5317 2018-10-30 13:36:36 Lol don’t throw a tantrum. I’m not forcing you to unify. It’s your choice. Every country is already finding oil if it’s oil that is intoxicating you all. I’m just saying you’re shortsighted if you think war in the north wouldn’t reach your “Biafran borders” soon enough

Another free oil change. At least I’m also getting refunded for the ‘tire patch’. I’m so done with that place.

I feel sorry for the people who actually believe you: it is absurd like the rest of your snake oil scams.
What you have created by exploding the debt, the tax scam et al is a situation for recession. The feds are trying to circumvent it.
5402 2018-10-30 13:26:32 Not always. Some organizations and players are like oil and water. After a while, they just don't mix and they need to be separated. We've seen it many times in the NFL. Like, maybe if Odell is on a better team, he wouldn't act the way he does.

5404 2018-10-30 13:26:17 Agree that oil is rolling over.The 3 yr bear market rally in oil from $26 is over & another leg to lower lows just beginning.Could see $10 oil in 2nd half of 2019 as  global bust next year hits demand hard.Would avoid energy stocks here as they likely underperform in coming rally
5405 2018-10-30 13:25:59 Iran is a major regional country with big gas and oil reserves and has a independent foreign policy. Afghanistan however has a US installed gov't and is influenced by India has policy constraints but even then they too are welcome if they wish to join.

5414 2018-10-30 13:25:15 When will we stop betraying ourselves? Since time immemorial, oil money has persistently being missing.
5415 2018-10-30 13:25:14 um...how can I watch this

5417 2018-10-30 13:25:06 Just this year #China has began to purchase oil with the chinese $YUAN.. the petrodollar will decline..
5418 2018-10-30 13:24:58 Double cleansingnya kali nder. Atau sunscreennya oil based?
5419 2018-10-30 13:24:56 I'd cut their $$$ off in a heartbeat, too, if I had a magic wand. The only thing an ocean of unearned petrodollars ever produces is entitlement, privilege, and vulgar displays of excess. Exactly why economists call it a "resource curse," easy oil wealth is actively destructive.

5423 2018-10-30 13:24:29 I use Oil of Olay too, but one of the fancier products.  I get it at Costco and its great.  Plus, I love a bahgain. 
5424 2018-10-30 13:24:22 I’m going out on a limb here James but I’ll bet you’ve even used that ‘evening primrose oil’ in the afternoon. 

Ps. Just curious to know if you have to take out special insurance for extreme activities? Asking for a friend! 
5425 2018-10-30 13:24:19 It definelty improves the quality of your life. It’s like a warm hug to your lil anxious heart. I got my cbd oil tincture from a farmers market in the north Austin area. 30ml 300mg for $40 which is the best deal I’ve found compared to smoke shops.
5426 2018-10-30 13:24:15 復唱！
5427 2018-10-30 13:24:09 If I take my car to get it’s oil changed I always worry about driving off into the hole in floor.

I don’t know if that’s ever happened but I feel like I would be the first one to do it.

5431 2018-10-30 13:23:30 . Oil boiler isn't working but we still have (free) hot water thanks to our @solariboost
5432 2018-10-30 13:23:30 Short-term greed over long-term prudence. AB gave away oil wealth in the form of low taxes (a flat-tax, no PST).
5433 2018-10-30 13:23:05 regardless, trucking has been going on for a long time because there was no cost for those who stole the oil more than the cost of transportation
5434 2018-10-30 13:23:00 So I was tiger poo with Apple cider vinegar, peroxide, and peppermint oil mix in warm water. He has not itched in 12 hours. Praise God.
5435 2018-10-30 13:22:57 Ion know cause the dealership gave me so many oil changes for free
5436 2018-10-30 13:22:49 How many of us females don’t need a nigga to tell them when to get their oil changed? 
5437 2018-10-30 13:22:47 My skin is perfectly clear right now and the secret is 5 dollar oil from Trader Joe’s. I haven’t been this glowing since I was 16 and I’m a little upset
5438 2018-10-30 13:22:47 FREE £13BN hand-out? It's the 40% of SCOTS REVENUE they steal every year! NOT TO MENTION THE 92% OIL REVENUE they STEAL from us & don't even admit is SCOTS (the fact its in the North Sea around Scotland is neither here nor there - apparently!)... It's OUR OWN MONEY!

The Super Dry thing was cool though, reckon we should bring the name back?

5446 2018-10-30 13:22:04 Many state oil corps & oil-supply firms are effectively bankrupt due to '08 global financial crash & oil price crash. These corps have been able in various ways to refinance, convert debt into equity, delay payments, etc., as it is in nobody's interest to liquidate them all.

5477 2018-10-30 13:20:15 Isn’t another reason why the USD has “value” is because all oil in the world is denominated and traded in $USD? Thus keeping it in demand... #ThePetroDollar
5478 2018-10-30 13:20:02 But I don’t get this whole thing ooo. Should we carry all the country’s money to her? Or is Margaret Simpson better than those selling cooking oil? Y’all stop been hypocrite
5479 2018-10-30 13:20:00 How is the game changing in oil and gas? We're kicking off this morning at the #DeloitteOilGas Conference with opening remarks from @JohnWEngland. Follow us today for more updates from our conference and recent releases.
5480 2018-10-30 13:20:00 Fake news from a Koch/oil funded shill.

5482 2018-10-30 13:19:55 This guy needs to be drop kicked out of Austin and into that giant decade-old oil slick in the Gulf of Mexico
5483 2018-10-30 13:19:54 Rupee weakened against the US Dollar today as foreign banks bought dollars noting sharp rise in Dollar. Oil importers' month-end dollar demand weighed on the unit. Some banks cover short dollar bets. However, some exporters' dollar sales in early trade supported the sentiment.
5484 2018-10-30 13:19:48 5N to the 91W R lane of trans rd & N Beach B on ramp to the 91W closed due to oil spill & now no word on when it will clear

5486 2018-10-30 13:19:41 Not only that, auto-efficiency is important - with EVs - to reaching peak oil demand sooner, which as we saw with coal, could create financial and political weakness for the industry and accelerate a shifting of bets to EVs.
5487 2018-10-30 13:19:28 Engine oil ke? mbet why

5495 2018-10-30 13:18:53 You can literally go for months without an oil change, been driving my car for 4 months with the oil light on, one day my heat stopped working & my car was out of every fluid.... needless to say if you like being warm I’d change it soon 
5496 2018-10-30 13:18:50 Shouldn't "BLEND" in large letters  point any reasonable consumer to the "Sunflower Oil"? Pure olive oil isn't blended.
5497 2018-10-30 13:18:48 Mega dams are as evil as COG (coal, oil, gas). And the World Bank and China are two of their biggest backers. Enviros, wake up.

5506 2018-10-30 13:17:40 It could only be otherwise if all the leaders were trustworthy. When M7 thinks the height of political strategy is being super-cunning and manipulative as he has demonstrated almost at every turn, e.g on the oil pipeline thru Mombasa, people start to mistrust everything from him.
5507 2018-10-30 13:17:30 whatsapp dengan ummi tak berhenti sebab cakap pasal essential oil dengan abbi cakap pasal duit n syarikat.. Dah berminggu tiap malam mimpi orang yang kat rumah je ni huhu

5516 2018-10-30 13:17:05 Maybe we should start by them leaving the south west first then, no? They’ll wipe themselves out by playing around oil wells soon enough, or end up trafficking each other to Italy. #italy should watch out because biafrans are about to empty their country into theirs.
5517 2018-10-30 13:16:41 This is confusing when a Westminster politician says North East they mean Newcastle  etc, has that area of England a significant oil and gas industry?

5532 2018-10-30 13:15:33 now oil is pulling back, let's see what's in the news(WSJ), this morning

5535 2018-10-30 13:15:28 I hate people using the word healed with brain injury. Brains do not work like that. Brain cells dont regrow. Neuroplasticity not thats another thing and hyperbaric oxygen treatment is great for that as it is loads of things. Same with CBD oil it does not cure it helps
5536 2018-10-30 13:15:21 I should have started with this:

Do you deny that humans combusting fossil fuels (coal oil gas) adds new CO2 to the systems, thereby causing global warming?

If the answer is yes, you’re a fact-denying fool and a tool.
5537 2018-10-30 13:15:18 Kak Mai nak tanya. Mcmana nak recover balik kulit muka yang breakout sebab cleansing oil?

5539 2018-10-30 13:15:10 Very smart! My grandmother has been using plain old Oil of Olay for as long as I can remember and she’s 90 but looks 60!
5540 2018-10-30 13:15:10 I use Tarte’s Maracuja oil in the fall/winter at night. It’s easy to target dry patches if you don’t want to put the oil all over.
5541 2018-10-30 13:15:04 Thank you for providing these company names. It helps me determine where my dollars will not go. Nestle also uses palm oil in  products which is one of the causes of climate change & loss of exotic species. Palm oil companies are slashing & burning rain forests to plant palms.
5542 2018-10-30 13:14:57 You think that an economic slowdown driven in part by global oil prices is more important than that? What's wrong with you?
5543 2018-10-30 13:14:45 Brazil's oil company @petrobras announced a 6.2 pct cut in gasoline prices at its local refineries as currency gains and falls in oil prices push values for refined products lower. The move reduces room for ethanol price rises #Brazil #Petrobras #gasoline #ethanol #sugar

5547 2018-10-30 13:14:32 I think it's coming.....I genuinely have $50 as a target for Oil in coming weeks (or months if you prefer) but then again I'm dogshit at trading Oil, though my forecasts are pretty good, I never make any money on Oil, too much risk involved for my liking, wide, wide stops needed
5548 2018-10-30 13:14:15 180 million people eating,  sleeping and contributing nothing to the World as a nation. All we do is drill oil, sell it, bank the money and share the proceeds. Even the oil is drilled by foreign companies.

5553 2018-10-30 13:13:45 Maybe immigration should be curbed I’d agree with that, but why not vote in a govt that will do that instead of leaving EU and becoming a nothing country again.. we don’t have oil or any resources, no industrial sector.. we’d be seriously harming ourselves I think?
5554 2018-10-30 13:13:38 Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the Name of The LORD.

5612 2018-10-30 13:09:07 Nah. Conservative: piss away big oil salary on trucks, "boy toys" and booze while oil price is high. Then blame the govt for falling oil prices and lost jobs, while ironically complaining about the cost of fueling a gigantic truck, and that the govt need to make cuts!

5623 2018-10-30 13:07:43 Venezuela's economic model failed because its economy pretty much comes only from oil. The US has more variety in its economy than Venezuela (oil. grains, gas, manufacturing), and given how we have a more libertarian system, it wouldn't be as much of a bomb as it was down there.

5722 2018-10-30 12:57:44 Mikey, Scotland is attributed 100% of oil revenues in GERS, and there is NO SUCH THING as whiskey export tax so it matters not one jot which port it leaves. The SG own publication ESS (Export Statistics Scotland) shows the value of exports & is attributed correctly in GERS

5731 2018-10-30 12:56:40 I think Scotland should set extraction licence prices for oil & gas, should be ones renegotiating them, should be setting taxes on them & should get ALL revenue from all aspects of them. Decommissioning work should go to Scottish companies. All revenue in oil/gas should stay here

5788 2018-10-30 12:50:00 Facts:
1. The stock market is not the same as the economy 
2. Less than 50% of Americans own any stock 
3. Venezuela is an oil based economy and ruled by an extreme right wing dictator 
4. The market did better under Obama
5. In one week all of the 2018 gains have been wiped out
5789 2018-10-30 12:49:56 I remember one American once told me: "But I didn't gain anything from the Iraqi oil!". I had to laugh and point out they were the first to be sold down the river, back in 1913. Identifying populations with their treacherous governments is one of the biggest follies ever.

5806 2018-10-30 12:48:16 If US wanted, to impose oil sanctions. They'd have done it already.

But if u look at it, Venezuela's PDVSA is already on bankrupt without any sanctions.

5831 2018-10-30 12:45:54 Look. These monthly variations mean nothing. If you read the article, most of increase went to CITGO. Are you denying the US gov't is trying to constrain VZ oil sales? Are you denying Lopez & his Mafia are demanding boycotts?

5833 2018-10-30 12:45:46 can’t afford not to

It’s already cheaper in new and replacement installations

Even better and costs for renewables continue to decrease and costs for oil/ gas/ coal continue to rise.

And that’s not even counting the full cost of oil: environmental, human health, and AGW.

5846 2018-10-30 12:44:44 Rock was incompatible with Oil Man but it wasn't very effective...
5847 2018-10-30 12:44:39 ほんとぉ？
5848 2018-10-30 12:44:34 You crossed the line of absurdity that distinguishes a troll. The simple-minded obstinacy and literal mindedness is both annoying and funny. Do you think baby oil is made of babies? Why is a TV called a 'set' if it isn't actually 2 things? Are you literally a band dog?

5861 2018-10-30 12:42:45 leaving class early today. I’m tired and I need an oil change.
5862 2018-10-30 12:42:43 Freshman year : * all decked up , doesn't repeat an outfit for months *

I'm impressed with how ugly I'm willing to look in public these days!
5863 2018-10-30 12:42:30 Managed that oil short so poorly because I'd had a couple loser attempts at it. Definitely noting this to look into as I've done this a few times recently.
5864 2018-10-30 12:42:28 やっぱりwwwwwwwww
5865 2018-10-30 12:42:26 I question why if 95% of Oil is in Scottish waters why SG doesn’t set tax rates etc

5868 2018-10-30 12:42:18 They will be ready for tiananmen 2.0 the difference between Xi & Manduro though is that Xi’s China is an oil importers while Manduro’s Venezuela is an oil exporters.
So China will never be a stable countries in the first place (democracies & dictatorship).

We’re our own problem.. every great nation has a process. We have the process but our corrupt self kills it.

5874 2018-10-30 12:41:19 A tax on carbon when there is no alternative is a tax grab. Funny how journalists like you have no problem with the dozens of supertankers of Saudi oil visiting our east coast each month pumping non environmentally friendly oil from a corrupt regime but hate ethical Alberata oil
5875 2018-10-30 12:41:17 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. New York City sleeps.

5881 2018-10-30 12:40:51 Trumps behavior isn’t surprising. He has always been a snake oil salesman and a horrid person. What continues to be shocking is all the enablers @GOP and supporters including American Jews (I am Jewish so probably more shocked).
5882 2018-10-30 12:40:51 The water they are supplying to Nairobi is said to cost more than Oil and Gold.
5883 2018-10-30 12:40:43 LOL - You know I often feel sorry for those taken in by a snake oil salesman, even as they breathlessly repeat the lies they were told.  SHS is not one of those.  So yeah, SHS is just one of the sharks in the Cruz infested waters I’d go with.
5884 2018-10-30 12:40:33 And for price of "YOUR LIFE SAVINGS", you get a can of snake oil on the side!

5910 2018-10-30 12:37:19 You forgot to mention how much oil and access the Sultan has and controls. USA nice to him, just like Saudi Arabia. Often we turn a blind eye to atrocities because of economic and real-world needs. His oil goes mainly to Japan.
5911 2018-10-30 12:37:14 UK please! 
Request: it would be nice if your EV filling stations also had a roof like your fossil burning customers. High voltage, high current, far bigger risk than oil getting wet. Just saying.

5917 2018-10-30 12:36:51 Exposure to sunlight helps a person improve his health because the ultraviolet rays convert skin oil into Vitamin.
5918 2018-10-30 12:36:50 Ironic, given that China is one of the few countries to prioritise renewable energy. That’s a decision based on science, when trad medicine is snake oil.

5920 2018-10-30 12:36:30 compare to: slightly radioactive water released to the ocean (Fukushima), water mixes and fastly decay as it's not naturally radioactive. 
It was also less rad than the ocean received from space that same day.
Oil don't dillute on water.
Still more people died from evacuation.
5921 2018-10-30 12:36:18 i really don’t feel like driving there for a oil change just for them to tell me about other shit on the car
5922 2018-10-30 12:36:15 That’s fair enough mate, iv got oil at mine and ideally would love to replace the boiler but it’s the running costs that scare me a bit with lpg

5930 2018-10-30 12:35:37 No. That isn’t a people problem. It’s a problem with what they are told, why and by whom. Of course our economy will collapse. It doesn’t run on the gold standard anymore. It runs on an oil standard.

Our economy is rebuilt on clean energy or our civilization collapses. Pick one.

5932 2018-10-30 12:35:30 Russia wont care about this. They believe in submarines. Putin says our new one is just a big target.  Russia are taking control of the northern mediterranean and establishing missile bases there. Libya, Syria and Iran will fund it with Oil monies.
5933 2018-10-30 12:35:08 I second the motion
5934 2018-10-30 12:35:06 Why would Iran plan attacks in Denmark when it needs the European market’s oil revenues..?

5949 2018-10-30 12:33:59 Here people switch from oil central heatings to wood-fuelled ones. Because it's cheaper & because govt promotes them. Not even in the summer we can leave our windows open - when neighbour starts the boiler for warm water, rooms are full of smoke.
5950 2018-10-30 12:33:51 The war and famine in Yemen. The horrific murder of a US resident and journalist. The imprisonment of critics and activists. Stuff the oil!

5953 2018-10-30 12:33:03 I think from engineering point of view, not from unreasonable fear.

5955 2018-10-30 12:32:57 Anyone struggling with anxiety or sleeping problems (can't speak for other mh issues) I'd 100000% recommend CBD oil. Pricey but worth every penny !!!
5956 2018-10-30 12:32:50 Barely notice it, tbh. (Didn’t vote for trump.) I Increased my savings by maybe a hundred bucks or so a month. I realize I’m quite fortunate to be able to do so.
5957 2018-10-30 12:32:50 Cheaper service and maintenance costs, no outlay for the setup through calor, cleaner, no smells. These guys have had enough of oil mate tbh.

5963 2018-10-30 12:32:07 It can't.  The next 50 years, regardless of which bunch of liars, cheats and snake oil salesmen are running the country, will be spent on keeping enough food on the table and medicines in the hospitals. Austerity is here to say, no matter whether its bluekip or redkip in charge.
5964 2018-10-30 12:32:04 you should take some rest or drink medicine if you need it. i hope you'll feel better soon. avoid eating food that has a lot of oil.

5985 2018-10-30 12:28:39 A Vote for Mr Barr would be a slap in the face for the state of the CLIMATE. He likely  believes that climate change is a HOAX and that the future lies in coal and oil.

5995 2018-10-30 12:27:51 I received an oil delivery late Friday and one yesterday morning and all day I was out delivering product. Boss says you might want to think of getting that all put away. I said you might want to think about not pulling me 50 directions and I will.
5996 2018-10-30 12:27:30 cause Im worth it.
5997 2018-10-30 12:27:20 No taxation without representation. And Turkana were right in the antagonism on oil. So when Mt Kenya people speaks they MUST no be intimidated or seen to be intimidated by anybody. If they say 60% or 100% contribution to GDP they must not be insulted. They represent their people
5998 2018-10-30 12:27:16 Texas was blue until Reagan. It's about oil. It's about deregulation. It's about perceived freedom of open land & shooting of guns. Why do you think they still refer to the state as The Republic of Texas...
5999 2018-10-30 12:27:14 Well... Since, the ONLY resource you belief States have is NATURAL resources; I have to respect your opinion, as u are entitled to it.

If India can earn like double what we earn from crude oil from software's alone, I know NATURAL resource isn't the ONLY resource!

6003 2018-10-30 12:26:23 As I've said, it's a constrained demand. Both sides can cause damage to other, but US has upper hand now that it net exports oil. US is comfortable enough to increase regime change pressure, keep VZ out of US financial system & restrict imports. Citgo under attack.
6004 2018-10-30 12:26:20 @theJeremyVine fuel duty has increased, crude oil has come down, Mr Cleaverly how do you have more money in your pocket?
6005 2018-10-30 12:26:04 A woman brought her car in this morning for an oil change that was 5000 miles past due and when pulling it into my bay there was a horrible screeching coming from the front.
6006 2018-10-30 12:26:01 Very true. I’m all for renewables, I just think it’s a fallacy to think to think that we can survive without petroleum products, much less all of the countries that also depend on our oil and gas industry.
6007 2018-10-30 12:25:49 Gary, we agree, oil by rail is dangerous and needs to be phased out.  I'm also glad you think we should stop selling arms to Saudi Arabia as well.  We're going to find that common ground some day, brother.  Some day.

6016 2018-10-30 12:24:37 Use cheap oil sheen and bonding remover for the remainder of the chunks. Then shampoo don’t over condition your hair youll already have had oils in your hair sitting for a while
6017 2018-10-30 12:24:23 I don't know anything about the way in which it was built, I just think that Gazprom and its oil subsidiary could have survived in a smaller and cheaper building and I generally find the quest to build the highest building in the universe a bit stupid.

6032 2018-10-30 12:22:49 The whole idea of a carbon tax is to generate revenue for the transition.  That's one way.  We could have followed Norway's example and collected significant royalties (like Peter Lougheed did).  Where do you think we should sell our oil to?

6040 2018-10-30 12:21:42 The SNP's OWN Growth Commission states that oil revenues are fully allocated in GERS to Scottish accounts on geographical basis. Why are you challenging the SNP's OWN document? Are the SNP's own GC lying or misleading or are they correct?

6059 2018-10-30 12:20:03 @DawnDish I actually need to thank you guys. Your dish soap is perfect for everything. I had multiple oil stains on my brand new shoes whenever I dropped some on the floor. All I had to do was use some dawn and bam that stuff was gone. Thanks
6060 2018-10-30 12:19:59 We're entering into a new area in public oil and gas markets where companies that people sort of like with not a lot of debt get taken over by companies that people sort of hate that have a lot of debt.
6061 2018-10-30 12:19:44 When you say that gold and petroleum are opposite, I guess what you mean is that when the economy is good, oil would be in demand, and on the other hand, when the economy is bad, gold would be in demand?

6074 2018-10-30 12:18:43 I'm glad we can agree on water protection.  If Alberta invested in refineries then we could have all enjoyed Canadian oil during the transition. Most of the oil is for export, and is some of the most dirty and hard to process, thus the price on world markets.  1/2

La tecnologia elettrica era pronta sin da allora. Sono i $ che decidono le tecnologie da sviluppare. Non altro.

6143 2018-10-30 12:11:08 TBS, demand is restricted due to quality of oil & refining costs. But VZ cannot meet contracts as of summer. Conoco seizure of assets has created current transport bottlenecks. Plus US trying to restrict exports. Strange people that root for their own country's destruction.
6144 2018-10-30 12:11:07 No, MERSA can get on surfaces.

6157 2018-10-30 12:09:50 You make a box of rocks look smart. Their main income is from oil they produce little else. Venezuela imoprts all it's product, so when oil prices went down they had little to back up those losses. coupled by the sanctions of the US govt, it is Haiti all over again.
6158 2018-10-30 12:09:39 The current price of Heating Oil is $2.769 per gallon.
6159 2018-10-30 12:09:36 As far as I can tell from the figures available, oil is being extracted at a maximum of 200,000 barrels per day NOT 180,000,000. At a value of £75 per barrel, and a tax rate of about 30% the UK treasury is getting just under £1.3bn a year.
6160 2018-10-30 12:09:32 They are fairly competent representational oil paintings, but in the absence of any other context or information as to their subject, seem exceptionally ill-suited for the setting.
6161 2018-10-30 12:09:27 Global warming will mess us up, but it's just not a big deal for wildlife - they'll adapt. The trouble is that GW gets all the attention and all the money and biodiversity gets fuck all. I'll say just two words. Palm. Oil.

6186 2018-10-30 12:07:58 Not being an economist - I'm wondering why uk govt freezes taxes on North Sea oil & gas. Surely this means the super rich companies who extract (steal Scotlands resources with UKgovt permission) get them for buttons. So this is great news for them but crap for Scotland! Explain!
6187 2018-10-30 12:07:52 If u were the president of Nigeria in 2015,oya tell me how u would av spent wisely without borrowing when 28 states were owing salaries and oil was sold at $28

6202 2018-10-30 12:06:14 It’s about who can hold longer: Saudi without FDIs, or the West without oil. If the latter, Europe will default to its usual Russian dependence (thus falling into Kremlin’s net). It’s all down to US’ ability to cater for its internal consumers & willingness to let Russia “expand”

6271 2018-10-30 11:59:25 Hi both temperatures are important and actually give you the same answer. I prefer oil as it is closer to the moving components and better informs about warm-up time. 90 degree for coolan and below 120 for oil generally.

6287 2018-10-30 11:56:49 Oil needs to stop being a symbol of power. They are only subsidising north sea oil and gas because the supply is running low. Patching holes and supporting a industry that's dying just for bragging rights and power is stupid.
6288 2018-10-30 11:56:35 Not everyone is ever going to have a gas line at their front door. U should be considering a equal subsidy to rural customers who have no option other than Propane or Oil. Even the folks heating with electricity get a subsidy. Something to think about.

6319 2018-10-30 11:51:43 We should stop Arab oil and ban people going to Arab countries for job. If our ancestors survived without car, bus or money we can also. We should bring in caste system and non- Brahmins should not waste money in getting education. No job should go for non-Brahmins

6411 2018-10-30 11:39:13 You mean a barrel of oil is sold at $7 dollar now? Why do you APC people like to lie? Do you think you are talking to a dullard? Please goole the price of crude and stop lying. Jeezz. M done with you. You’re a liar!. As at yesterday, crude was $77.62 on OPEC global market.
6412 2018-10-30 11:39:10 iirc, either @_deepakanand or @trinafraser   discussed this in a thread a few weeks ago. Is this legit? Has HC greenlit oil imports for medical?

6419 2018-10-30 11:38:47 So to be clear, you are ok with 50% marginal state and local tax rates for everyone, a 25% VAT tax for every purchase, high tariffs and excise taxes, Drilling and selling every possible ounce of oil and gas and taxing it and eliminating 90% of the  carrier groups. The true cost.

What’s not to love?
6439 2018-10-30 11:35:45 I am not interested in talking to you. Sell it to somebody lonely, who lacks critical thinking skills. The Bible is just a book. There is no 'god'. You are not a righteous or moral person, Bob, just a snake oil salesman. Ta ta!
6440 2018-10-30 11:35:35 @NicolL_CARmag hi Nicol. I own a 2017 320d. It has an oil temp gauge instead of coolant temp. Surely, a coolant temp gauge is more important than an oil temp guage? Granted, I can see when my oil temp is optimum and drive accordingly, but the coolant temp is surely more critical?

6453 2018-10-30 11:33:53 No it’s not. It’s cheaper than oil and coal for them too, and will get even cheaper with time while fossil fuels continue to increase in cost.
6454 2018-10-30 11:33:49 They bring it up to cast doubt on the intelligence (and honesty) of those who praised it.

6458 2018-10-30 11:33:38 It also means that there's a substantial amount of Iranian oil money poured into bringing pilgrims here every year; money that could be well-spent in building a classroom for those children who need it in the South East of Iran.
6459 2018-10-30 11:33:37 I guess palm oil is for fueling cars

6469 2018-10-30 11:32:34 The key part is "subject to the jurisdiction."
Illegal aliens having no legal presence and being forigen nationals subject to jurisdiction of their home countries in a contextual sense may not qualify.

6554 2018-10-30 11:19:03 US Investor says, "Without Scottish oil Little England doesn't have much to sell anymore” says Jim Rogers, co founder of Quantum Fund. UK Balance of payments upon Scottish Independence is a relevant killer argument.

Remember - when Oil runs out - WM will dump us on our arses.

6569 2018-10-30 11:17:40 Good to see the Chancellor continuing to support the oil and gas industry, with no change to current tax rates, investment in decommissioning and the already announced measures on transferable tax histories.
6570 2018-10-30 11:17:39 Talisman before that, as well. He definitely got the lawyers tooled up when the rumours of his links to ISIL oil smuggling leaked out. He can't do much about the disapproval ratings caused by his offshore tax avoidance scheme, though, as that's factual.

6572 2018-10-30 11:17:38 No other oil states are living hyperinflation.

No other oil states have lost 50% of their oil production without having an belic conflict.

Venezuela is the result of radical leftwing policies, missmanagement and hard populism.
6573 2018-10-30 11:17:34 I feel so much like going long #ES_f rather than #oil. Recent price action has already moved the CL/ES ratio in favour of of #WTI and we should be reversing that real soon.

6605 2018-10-30 11:14:37 Overall revenues have dipped since the crash in oil prices. This govt however has taken the most approach to better collection. Tax base has grown 5M new users in the past 3 years with initiatives like VAIDS. Can you beat that? Imagine what it'll look like by 2023. Just chill :)

6620 2018-10-30 11:12:46 taxes are important to every government, my question is what has the government done with the taxes collected in the past. The Uk depends on taxes for most of its social welfare schemes. We have oil & natural resources are not maximised. Those hawkers pay a lot of informal taxes.
6621 2018-10-30 11:12:43 Brand was irrelevant. I've purchased LP oil but have also made my own.
6622 2018-10-30 11:12:42 You are mixing things here. Exemption and suspension!!! The cooking oil still pays duty. You needed licence to import but now you don't need one. Pads were never on the list of things that needed licence to import

6626 2018-10-30 11:12:28 There’s been a lot of “off the books” accounting for a few years under the Tories just 1 example the non attributable income from oil revenue, you just know this was going into a Brexit fund for just this type of budget bribery.
6627 2018-10-30 11:12:19 But if you follow safety protocol, and check the gas gage and check for leaks. Remember not to get oil or dust on the gages. You will be ok.
6628 2018-10-30 11:12:13 oil and gas is a hell of a lot more fun than (say) financial services and retail. it's never just about the thing itself is it? Money / power / geopolitics etc. I'm happy to admit I'm a geek for this sort of stuff

6701 2018-10-30 11:03:48 Politicians want that dirty oil money:(
6702 2018-10-30 11:03:46 It's pure palm oil,  no additives added. I will definitely get international market?  From where.  If it's easy we would have started. Even if it's investing 100k we will still get profit for it. But the problem is getting the international market to us.
6703 2018-10-30 11:03:45 THEY REALLY NEED TO LEAVE QUEEN !!!

6704 2018-10-30 11:03:40 Switching from coal and oil generally to natural gas. I don't know how much of the gas was tracked versus other sources. But oil and coal are very dirty!

6706 2018-10-30 11:03:31 For sure, I was more coming from the stance of krill oil being a source of DHA in phospholipid form  Thanks for the link!
6707 2018-10-30 11:03:14 Wasn’t the argument at the time that we had hundreds of years of coal available but having to buy  oil would affect the balance of payments? Steam engines a lot cheaper to build and more suited to poor state of railway then. Nobody worried about the dirt from burning coal.

Truth is; its  trash & I am sure it wasnt made for Nigerians in mind.

They need to ditch the sauce & the alleged Chicken chunks.

The sauce is like palm oil.
The chicken is like dried wood.

6719 2018-10-30 11:01:14 Scotia's energy team: "We believe the worst of the Canadian oil market is behind us." But..."Substantial risks to our constructive thesis on Canadian oil differentials primarily concern the timing of crude by rail (CBR) build-out and the expected scheduling of ENB’s Line 3."

6721 2018-10-30 11:00:22 Norway woke up to their addiction and reliance on oil and gas and addressing it at pace last decade. They have squandered and made huge mistakes with this wealth as well but compared to the rest they look better. Fearing recession in the. 80’s they sped up extraction of crude.

6723 2018-10-30 11:00:09 Use a clarifying shampoo, then deep condition. After that, keep your scalp regularly oiled with tea tree and castor oil. It won't smell good, but it works, especially after getting braids out.
6724 2018-10-30 11:00:08 It's "sad" when someone sells Palm oil? The real tragedy here is how we measure people worth by what the do and our desire to spread falsehood/fake news.
6725 2018-10-30 11:00:06 Evil chump is HOPEFULLY the last dying gasp of white supremacy. If we can throw off the shackles of big oil/gas/pharma/ag(&banks!) on our economy that make our sorry orange puppet dance, we can show the world anything is possible. No cowering into authoritarian dictatorships.

6729 2018-10-30 10:58:53 Driven by the deepening economic crisis, Rouhani appoints new ministers, including a new economy minister. But, it will make little (if any) difference. Rising double digit inflation (31.4%)+the reimposition of US sanctions on Iran's oil sector=a sharp economic recession in 2019.

6736 2018-10-30 10:58:08 Front-month Brent crude oil futures were at $77.05 a barrel at 0428 GMT, down 29 cents, or 0.4%, from their last close.
6737 2018-10-30 10:58:01 Brent oil prices dipped on Tuesday, weighed down by ongoing weakness in global stock markets and by signs of rising global supply despite looming sanctions on Iran's crude exports.

6746 2018-10-30 10:57:25 It’s not a case of “trying to say it’s destroying the environment”.

It is. It’s a fact.

But so are oil companies, logging companies, car owners, over-fishing, single use plastics.

It’s more a case of whether we choose to use a more environmentally conscious alternative.

6767 2018-10-30 10:53:45 Steve, did you even bother reading that article? "When the oil price plummeted in 2014, Venezuela was faced with a shortfall of foreign currency (...) The result: businesses increased prices and inflation rose." This was the major reason.
6768 2018-10-30 10:53:40 BP reports results fueled by higher oil prices. Profit rose to $3.8 billion in Q3, more than double compared to the same period in 2017.
6769 2018-10-30 10:53:38 My depressing prediction of the day is this - in the coming years we will see a rise in eco-terrorism with bombings of airports, oil and mining companies and the meat industry. This will get worse as the destruction we have wrought on our planet becomes harder to ignore.

6773 2018-10-30 10:52:50 US stock futures are off from  down 0.5% for the Dow, down 1% for the S&P, and off 2% for the Nasdaq.  Both Asia and Europe are mixed. Gold is $66.60 with oil at $1,222. Daily volatility means how a day starts may have no impact on the finish. I will watch the finish line.

6784 2018-10-30 10:50:55 Hey babe. Uhmmm it’s pretty straight forward I think. Sauté half an onion(small dice) and three crushed garlic cloves in olive oil. And cherry tomatoes and fry till they start to burst. Add 1 teaspoon of chili flakes. Season with salt and pepper. Pour in one cup of cook bulgur.
6785 2018-10-30 10:50:55 Other weird factors with the Lion Air 737 is the oil slick was tiny & there was no ocean fire. Meaning very little fuel on-board. Which is normal for such a short run.

Ayrıca yine National Iran Oil Company'nin Dalian ve Zoushan bölgesinde depoları var. Rakamlar büyük ve Çin'in petrole ihtiyacı var.

6846 2018-10-30 10:41:17 Still perpetuating the lie about oil. Credit your followers as having double digit IQ’s for once.
6847 2018-10-30 10:41:11 Imagine being in the Wild West, when the snake oil salesman comes to town, and you know it’s bullshit.

Failing to convince friends and family that it doesn’t work, but the salesman is so good.  Tells them whatever they want to hear to get their money.  You just watch, helpless.

6861 2018-10-30 10:38:49 SCOTLAND - Remember.
Remember when we had a Scottish Stock Exchange?
Remember when we discovered Scottish Oil? 
Remember just after that, when England ordered the closing of our Stock Exchange so all of our new oil business would be transferred to their London Stock Exchange.
6862 2018-10-30 10:38:49 Cities growth deal well short of promised amount. Glad you acknowledge it’s Scotland’s Oil and Gas. The next step is to agree that all taxes from it should be allocated  to Scotland. Now that would really be standing up for us rather than boasting about saving washers for WI.
6863 2018-10-30 10:38:29 I don’t think the west is romantic about Saudi Arabia but more dependant Oil travels to the west along with its wealth Arms flow to Saudi creating jobs and wealth

And the prayer of faith shall save the sick &the Lord shall raise him up; &if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven..

6870 2018-10-30 10:37:46 After inheriting a dwindling economy; rapidly dipping GDP growth due crashing oil prices w/o dire savings. Nigeria slipped into a recession. We are out now even before oil prices started rising again. Watch out for how it'd be in a couple more years under the current system. 
6871 2018-10-30 10:37:44 With a lie from Rumsfeld about weapons of mass destruction, GW was able to invade Iraq. As Oil prices soared and the Peak Oil came up and fracking was unpopular the reason was found to invade other countries. With fear you catch People and Power! And in the US fear is Power!

6877 2018-10-30 10:37:25 Know what's wild? Yesterday I was having fully deep discussions about trauma. Like hearing your mum being beat & raped when you're a kid in the next room. Chat about how feeling the cold, & how scent of some oil take her right back to trying to keep cold out her legs on the beat.
6878 2018-10-30 10:37:25 Comparing a smoothie to oil isn’t too....appealing.

Uh. But he’ll still take it. And give it a SIP.

6881 2018-10-30 10:36:38 So i've just had a quick nip to tesco for the 11am refuel and i walked all the shelves and aisle and found 9 organic products

1. Nuts
2. Nuts
3. Nuts
4. Apples
5. Olive Oil
6. Bread
7. Tinned tomatoes
8. Bananas
9. Houmous

That's IT.
6882 2018-10-30 10:36:25 Yeah maybe if your nice you could ask them to move their major projects that have just went online from Gulf of Mexico, Australia, Azerbaijan, Russia, and Egypt that have given them this jump in profit as Oil is about to crash as EV roll out. 
6883 2018-10-30 10:36:19 I once made sun dried tomatoes in the oven and put them in the jar with the oil and everything. They were good.

6886 2018-10-30 10:36:09 Cream of tarter put a teaspoon under your tongue and mix a teaspoon with water and drink at the same time. You can also use peppermint oil. Rub on temples.
6887 2018-10-30 10:36:06 LOL. PDSVA workers went out on strike to force gov't change. They lost. Oil production continued for years. Heavy VZ oil is not that desirable. Requires special refining. With supply gluts & collapse of global oil prices, any mgt would have had problems. US hostility didn't help.
6888 2018-10-30 10:36:06 America has been at perpetual war for over a century invading countries and stealing their oil... Sir.
6889 2018-10-30 10:36:00 If you’re looking for a farming analogy, a farmer would never buy expensive fish oil to sprinkle on paddocks, unless it was PROVEN to increase crop yields. But consumers buy heavily promoted & expensive fish oil for conditions where benefit has not been conclusively established.
6890 2018-10-30 10:35:54 First time I agree with you. Wish we did all these basic things when we had more money. I could remember during Gowon era, oil boom.
6891 2018-10-30 10:35:49 Collapsing since Nigerians are not ready for diversification. Venezuela  is a clear example to every oil producing country that failed to diversify
6892 2018-10-30 10:35:40 Stupid bigger picture, we the world stop using Saudi Oil? Liberalism has become a mental issue.

6910 2018-10-30 10:33:30 And if there is a New World Order I call it a conspiracy theory to catch Peoples what Trump actually did. I don’t believe such. It’s like the same hoax as Chemtrails. It’s all about money and the Bush‘s wanted to secure Big Oil in Iraq!
6911 2018-10-30 10:33:30 1ヶ月前くらいからヘアトリートメントをLUCIDO-LのARGAN RICH OILにしてみた。髪が厚いけど細い黒髪ロングさんとかには良さそう。私が使うと直後から汗ばんだ直後みたいにまとまり過ぎてしまって、特に前髪を横に流さずそのままおろすスタイルがお風呂はいってるか怪しい人みたいになってつらい
6912 2018-10-30 10:33:24 Tried taking these lashes off with oil. One eye wouldn’t budge. Now I got one with lashes and one without 
6913 2018-10-30 10:33:09 The fall in #AMER SP creates a sizeable opportunity. H2 prod currently 4,940 bopd. H1 realised oil price was 9% discount price to brent, which would make H2 after 4 months $70 per barrel. Costs $20.50 per barrel.

So achieved H2 netbacks at $30m and rising. Bargain

6916 2018-10-30 10:32:56 I inherit an oil change and car wash shop unexpectedly and want to offload it, having to choose between a somewhat bullying Long Island type and a Mexican who I used to play soccer at the park.
6917 2018-10-30 10:32:53 I went to Shape Shifters yesterday there’s a 1 hour wait for the Richard Wilson oil piece. If you’ve not seen the Clock Tate modern that was quiet and free!

6966 2018-10-30 10:25:57 Westminster as a parking lot for nuclear weapons and a source of billions of pounds in oil revenue, don’t expect it to let Scotland go easily. 
6967 2018-10-30 10:25:43 I will teach you guys how to invest your earnings without borrowing money. Big companies or US government don’t borrow money for projects. They know where to get money for their projects. Nigeria earns enough money from the sale of crude oil to help build her projects.
6968 2018-10-30 10:25:26 Today I am mostly wearing my new industrial themed perfume. Eau de Kero. The oil delivery man slipped off his ladder this morning whilst filling our tank. He's fine, it was just all a bit Benny Hill, but I did feel I needed to help him clear the spill up. Country life ;)
6969 2018-10-30 10:25:09 Well you could have done a better job so we could read the article. We moved to Scotland when we retired.

6976 2018-10-30 10:23:54 You'd hope so but hey you were okay with bombing, killing kids while invading other countries as long as there's oil and other resources for the Elite to carve up.
6977 2018-10-30 10:23:36 Be a professional no sentiment, what happens on twitter remains on twitter.
6978 2018-10-30 10:23:31 @realDonaldTrump In the case of sanctions, there is no exemption in the oil embargo, no country should be exempted, China and India should be banned if they buy oil from Iran on November 4th.

6983 2018-10-30 10:22:56 Hardly surprising............all the top players slashed their operating costs so they would make profit on oil being $50 a barrel..........shame they can’t pass those savings onto the customer at the pump !

7045 2018-10-30 10:12:36 The problem is they cannot convert the fuel oil. So it would go in and comeback out again. If big enough discount will be bought by other refiners with conversion capacity. Russia used to sell a lot of straight run fuel oil which was used as refinery feedstock.

7081 2018-10-30 10:07:45 Maybe they expected her to be busy cracking real estate deals, even when she’s not in that circles. Our sense of what should be and not be, is very poor and sickening. Bridget Dzorgbunuku,a fmr Miss G, sells Palm oil and it’s lucrative. We are weak
7082 2018-10-30 10:07:44 Who told you this crap...gas prices rose because Gas and oil prices also rise when the value of the dollar declines. Oil contracts are all denominated in dollars. Oil prices rose between 2002 and 2014 because the dollar lost 40 percent of its value during that time.

7084 2018-10-30 10:07:32 I wouldn’t count on it. The oil industry & various other interests threatened by Tesla are not going to roll over and give up. The short interest, as impressive as it seems, is pocket change to them. They benefit from every day of delay.
7085 2018-10-30 10:07:27 Nice. Eat the skin, too. Keep bite-sized pieces separate from the flesh in the roasting tray - sprinkle with mixed herbs, pepper, olive oil and salt and enjoy the crunchy result while still hot. Yum.

7121 2018-10-30 09:59:51 Good for you. And I'm assuming few to none of Scottish MPs voted for fracking in Westminster.
Yet, Scotland has oil and gas fired power plants, all of Europe acts as if gas is a green alternative.
7122 2018-10-30 09:59:37 Hair oil is such a frustration for me! Love using it but have such a hard time finding the right stuff for my hair. Got something new last night. Showered, put new oil in my hair. Woke up with mostly dry yet super greasy hair.
7123 2018-10-30 09:59:29 It's the oil, fool.

Tip #9:
Always check your engine oil levels cause its the lifeblood of your car's engine. Driving without it will cause the engine to burn up in seconds. This in the long run will quicken the wear & tear of your car due to friction & heat.

7209 2018-10-30 09:42:31 You get people out of hunger through agriculture. But for a country to develop you need productivity in agriculture and excess labor saved to do more. Nigeria has not made that transition. Urban areas are sustained by oil and western union.

7269 2018-10-30 09:36:25 Probably just still use some olive oil and a bit of salt. Would come up a treat I reckon. Securing it on the spit might be a challenge and not slowly eating away at it while it cooks.

7289 2018-10-30 09:33:52 Selling the palm oil in that state  shows she wasn't properly compensated for her work. You should see the interview when she breaks down and cries, asking the gov't to give her all they promised.
7290 2018-10-30 09:33:32 Apparently we've got our own oil too. But we have to buy petroleum products from asia at inflated prices. Oh and our gas we give away. Don't forget all the minerals Gina gets the money for which is the countries assets. She is laughing all the way to the bank. Barnabys mate.
7291 2018-10-30 09:33:31 Be a different story minus the oil.

7294 2018-10-30 09:33:24 Poczytaj o zjawisku „peak oil” oraz o metodzie jaką szacowane są złoża ropy naftowej w OPEC. Pisał o tym zdaje sie Paul Johnson w „Historii świata”. Jeśli mu wierzyć, to kraje arabskie tak naprawdę nie wiedzą ile tej ropy pozostało.

Not a mention when the money was flowing the other way but as soon as it turns a profit that can be taxed it's 'Our Oil'. Funny that.

7334 2018-10-30 09:28:38 The people who claim otherwise have just swallowed oil company propaganda designed to make people think it's impossible. It's the flip side of climate denial.  Say there's no way to fix anything so people give up hope.

7344 2018-10-30 09:27:50 Coconut oil is rich in vitamin C and E. Lemon juice too is rich in vitamin C. The two vitamins C and E are strong antioxidants. When coconut oil is blended with lemon juice, they nourish and brighten the skin, giving you a youthful glow.
7345 2018-10-30 09:27:48 I suspect this growth is due to the rise in oil prices rather than increases in physical volumes of goods

7376 2018-10-30 09:25:09 Good piece and thanks for sharing your thoughts. Your first job as a coach in todays environment is to inspire kids to play independently of you. Far too many snake oil salesmen out there putting their platers product on a tumour.

7395 2018-10-30 09:22:05 But should we dismiss him on that account? What of those that were healed by his anointing oil, is that a falsehood too?
7396 2018-10-30 09:22:00 There is no point in saying something like that. You can't trust/expect that individuals are going to do what is right or even know which is the right thing to do. For example, so many people are unaware of how many products contain palm oil and what that means for Orangutans.

7402 2018-10-30 09:21:14 Very ironical indeed. This is a bad precedent. What if the Turus now claim that all the oil is theirs? With this kind of mindset, we can't build  the desired natuon-state where we must be each other's keeper

7410 2018-10-30 09:19:49 Climate catastrophe is already here. We've missed the boat. 12 years is a fantasy. We know the reasons and nothing is being done - just more and more pristine rainforest being destroyed to make way for Palm Oil. It will take a century to replace but nobody's taking action
7411 2018-10-30 09:19:43 We won't be fine as nation if the ruling class continues to steal  the oil revenue that's meant for the populace..this belongs to us all!

7434 2018-10-30 09:16:33 By their own hand the article should say. China has to use U.S. dollars to purchase oil.

Also you taxed my wages, interest, some of my food, drink, coke, everything else I buy and tax fuel twice meaning I pay 78p tax on a litre of diesel. No favours done at all.

7959 2018-10-30 07:42:37 3. Use makeup sparingly  
Prevent foundation, powder or blush during an acne breakout. But if you do, make sure to wash your face at the end of the day. If possible, choose oil free cosmetics since oil can cause acne. Also look for "noncomedogenic" one to prevent acne.

7992 2018-10-30 07:37:48 1. Keep your face clean
Whether you have acne or not, it's important to wash your face daily to remove impurities, dead skin cells and extra oil. Avoid scrubbing your skin harshly on a towel and try leaving your face wet to make your face hydrated

8007 2018-10-30 07:34:10 No my friend.Venezuelan's crisis started long before that.
On 1998 Venezuela's oil production was on 3.500.000 barrersof daily oil.
Today, 2018, nearly 1.200.000... nothing else but miss management, corruption and plundering of the company caused that.

HELP A FRIEND OUT!!! 

I want to buy cooking oil which one is the best:
8217 2018-10-30 06:58:50 This heat got my coconut oil completely melted
8218 2018-10-30 06:57:59 You are the hypocrite #Yoruba claiming to love the northerners to keep the unity of the country. You voted out #GoodluckJonathan a southern Christian from the #BightOfBiafra to safeguard your oil wealth in #BightOfBiafra playing on both sides of the divide.. @TobyAkitoye
8219 2018-10-30 06:57:40 A vibrant oil and gas sector is a fast-track to sea level rise and global economic collapse. NZ energy doesn’t need fossil fuels, and our regions deserve sustainable futures.
8220 2018-10-30 06:57:40 The US would never allow socialism to survive in an oil rich nation so close to home. The Venezuelan revolution was always doomed by that fact.
8221 2018-10-30 06:57:35 Kompres toner aja pake cosrx asol/cuka apel. Pake tbs tea tree oil jg bisa.
Kalo mau coba sharenya cek shopee sparklelle yuk

8230 2018-10-30 06:56:04 Awww when they so small constipation is the worst I’ve seen other mothers usin 2ml warm olive oil to help with bowl movement and it works wonders
8231 2018-10-30 06:55:50 Minju poured 500grams of flour to a bowl, then she cracked 2 eggs, before then she mixed the eggs with the flour. @hnybona was frozen fresh from the freezer. She cut it to small dices pieces, dip them in to the flour, and then put it in to the hot oil afterwards.
8232 2018-10-30 06:55:46 24
8233 2018-10-30 06:55:22 It's pure white hate of all different kinds of people being inspired by the snake oil salesmen Trump
8234 2018-10-30 06:55:14 I don't think you've been paying attention? Gvt has been talking about and addressing shortages from day one. 100 million litres of fuel provided from today. Cooking oil - makatora land. Kutadza kurima soya and making cooking oil is our laziness. But even that has been addressed.
8235 2018-10-30 06:55:06 차라리 바람 보다는 폭풍이 더 어울리지 않나 어쩌구 폭풍
8236 2018-10-30 06:54:41 Oil and gas experts have expressed optimism about an agreement that was signed Sept. 19 between Egypt and Cyprus to establish a direct subsea gas pipeline that would transport gas from Cyprus’ Aphrodite gas field  Egyptian liquefaction stations for re-export to European countries
8237 2018-10-30 06:54:39 You need to explain this more.

Tax is paid in Naira first in Nigeria. That's internal.

How does that affect oil payment by foreign exchange and it's use to pay for our debts and for foreign reserve?

Please expantiate.
8238 2018-10-30 06:54:15 In business, business owners can fire people

But when it comes to running a country, those in charge have a duty of care to one and all

Branded @theSNP office-bearers calling Scotland’s blockchain academics and @scotgov partner ‘snake oil salesmen’ is a disgrace in all contexts
8239 2018-10-30 06:54:14 W/ some warm oil too omg

8259 2018-10-30 06:50:36 Is it wine or olive oil in a bottle? :)
8260 2018-10-30 06:50:31 Hahahaha sana oil? 
8261 2018-10-30 06:50:13 Yup! When someone is so used to getting a few bucks a day in their country n all you have to do is get your butt to America and live off welfare! It is like striking oil to them!
8262 2018-10-30 06:49:51 내가 굳이 하얀색에 집착하는 이유는 하얀색이 평화와 평등을 상징해서 그렇거든?근데 그러면 작품 내에 하얀색이 특별한 색으로 자꾸 나와줘야 할 것 같아서 성가셔서 쓰기 싫음ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

8265 2018-10-30 06:49:27 I borrowed a family member my weave  it came back and it’s so hard she probably put oil sheen on it not to mention that it’s way shorter than it was when I gave it to her

8268 2018-10-30 06:48:53 To all young Nigerian out there struggling to build a business from the scratch, paying their bills  without any support; may your oil never run dry and may the universe put things in place for you.
8269 2018-10-30 06:48:50 Pro Israel is a strategic geo-political arrangement doesn't  mean you actually like Jews.  The US buys crude oil from opec countries and still blame them for it. This is so nonsensical when you can't call hate speech from the high commander Trump.
8270 2018-10-30 06:48:49 I like Snapchat’s new filter, “Burning the Midnight Oil”

Why?

Because that’s what this biz shit feels like

I have last thoughts on my mind I need to get rid of, give some insight, and finally move on to something different

It’s just like burning oil in a car
8271 2018-10-30 06:48:37 Did you read the bill?  Are you in bed with the oil and gas companies, including Phillips 66, Chevron, BP, and Shel, who have collectively donated or pledged millions to oppose the measure?
8272 2018-10-30 06:48:34 @JackSlackMMA I am kind of drunk at the moment but am sincere in my ensuing sentiment. This Twitter shit is new to me but I have been tracking your it. I am about to work in the oil fields and am interested in funding a website for you. What do you need to make that happen?
8273 2018-10-30 06:48:22 I will love to have conversations with you talk about my anger on Saudi Arabia how we should invade Saudi Arabia steal the oil destroy its regime trump please contact me and we solve problems in Saudi Arabia

8281 2018-10-30 06:46:37 totally. that’s all i’ve heard too in the last year. with all the infrastructure & oil/gas projects being approved in the north, #cityofpg will be the hub for contractors & workers to set up shop & live. cheaply & fruitfully, i might add.  @BrianSkakunCity knows as well.
8282 2018-10-30 06:46:35 Check out chocolate olive oil mousse by Nigella Lawson. I think that's the recipe we used.
8283 2018-10-30 06:46:34 @gruber re: conventional cars; big oil could give you one for free as long as you subscribed to their product.
8284 2018-10-30 06:46:20 Y’all really still taking sides on this Cardi and Nicki banana oil? They are both embarrassing honestly.

8295 2018-10-30 06:45:07 Lemme get this straight. You think Big Oil is spending millions of dollars to oppose I-1631 because they're concerned it's going to raise the cost of your fuel? Wow. Dance, monkey. Dance. #YesOn1631

8309 2018-10-30 06:42:10 I never knew cooking oil was the biggest commodity in a household till i saw those long queues.
8310 2018-10-30 06:42:01 The claim in the ad is: WeldCo would lose more than $3,000/student. That is not true. School districts receive mandatory funding. An accurate claim would be, “IF property tax revenue decreases because of oil/gas limits, the state would have to backfill with oft-strapped budget.”
8311 2018-10-30 06:41:59 Ngabe uthe annointing oil yakhe cure HIV I would give him a chance because that's his expertise. He is a "spiritual" person so we can't argue against that cos it's his field. Medicine is a different ball game altogether, that's why we have to 2nd guess his drug.
8312 2018-10-30 06:41:32 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
8313 2018-10-30 06:41:29 Sorry I don't agree. First, I don't know who says that banning fossil fuels will solve all environmental issues. Second, I see no evidence at all for the view that alternatives to oil in terms of energy, apart from nuclear, would result in anything like the negative costs of oil.
8314 2018-10-30 06:41:15 Chasing this fucking oil leak isn't fun. But I think I got it. 
8315 2018-10-30 06:41:06 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
8316 2018-10-30 06:41:06 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

8361 2018-10-30 06:32:00 Squealer has remained curiously silent on Venezuela. Now a totalitarian failed State caught up in an Orwellian nightmare. A country with the largest known reserves of oil now a dystopian landscape of joblessness & malnutrition. But still the Squealing Corbynites laud it...

8372 2018-10-30 06:30:24 This was on the cards anyway imo, oil price drop had to be temporary and China slowdown was sure to affect commodities. Trump tariff war simply accelerates the timeline. Throw in demonization and RERA and it seems like a correction is inevitable.

8375 2018-10-30 06:29:57 We are so obsessed with fossil fuels we believing the banning of them will solve the environmental issues we face. We will simply extract something else and create a different impact. How many oil based products are used to generate hydro, solar and wind?

8395 2018-10-30 06:25:46 A disgrace, But then they all are folks, ANY currently serving politician is a snake oil salesperson and will lie endlessly to further their quest for power and prominence, Don't trust a single one of them, Rats one and all.
8396 2018-10-30 06:25:21 Even with the unprecedented media attack and accusations against #SaudiArabia , it didn’t use oil to presure the world economy and thought first in the stability of the market, and disconnected economy from politics in a mature manner demonstrating the #saudi justice

8402 2018-10-30 06:24:30 Well, there is difference opinion among traditional people and doctors about having Oil Bath. We are supposed to have it on Deepavali day. What is the SC opinion about it? Also, in cities with acute water scarcity, should it be permitted? How much ML of water can be used?

8406 2018-10-30 06:24:00 Well, no comment on the first bit, but the pension age was set when life expectancy was much lower. Therefore funding pensions is a big issue. Didn't help that the Tories squandered oil revenues on tax cuts rather than prepare for this, which they knew was coming.

8409 2018-10-30 06:23:05 The amount of money, Nigeria makes yearly from crude oil is more than the amount of money, South Africa makes from it's total exports yearly
8410 2018-10-30 06:23:05 Childhood years... Tamilian style, everyone would wake up early morning on #Deepawali (as it is called in TN), have a til oil bath, wear new clothes, to try & be the first to burst a #cracker... who will first break the silence of the morning? Now #SC will decide time to burst !
8411 2018-10-30 06:22:56 Forgive them, it is the oil price my friend! and way who is the Airlines who dare to do so ?
8412 2018-10-30 06:22:49 Yup. “Sorry, we’re a little busy at the moment having coffee and donuts and checking the oil in our tires. Maybe tomorrow. Try calling Spartacus or Hillary.  Or Bernie Sanders.”

8420 2018-10-30 06:21:36 How about getting NEP on a level footing first? It's been marginalized since time immemorial and GoK policies only furthered that.
We all know once oil is found in that region, all this talk will miraculously disappear.
8421 2018-10-30 06:21:34 มันแฟร์หรอวะส้นตีน
8422 2018-10-30 06:21:20 Sorry, I can't see the point you're making. Humans do pretty much everything, including getting the oil out of the ground in the first place. Yes. If humans generated electricity it would be something else: yes, it would be a cleaner, smarter (etc.) world.
8423 2018-10-30 06:21:16 @realDonaldTrump Posts on Twitter don't guarantee win of Republican candidates on midterms when control of oil market fully guarantee. Think, midterms are near.

8433 2018-10-30 06:18:54 You are right remember that Kenyan - Magaya type preacher who was arrested in the U.K?. Gilbert Deya is his name he was selling Olive oil claiming it was miracle cure for HIV  that was around 2016. So Magaya only jumping on bandwagon now to cash in on desperate beings.
8434 2018-10-30 06:18:42 correction one....although her sentiment is heartful and honest, ISIS is just another AlQaeda made by US to control over oil wells and territory in a cheaper and more convenient way, as opposed to sending in their own troops. but yeah, Muslims are persecuted unfairly.
8435 2018-10-30 06:18:32 we have to move on from fossil fuels. breathing in polluted air affects the brain. we already have the technology and alternatives, all that's left is the will to make the change. We should not let Big Oil prevent us from a cleaner and sustainable source of energy
8436 2018-10-30 06:18:00 Talk about cruelty free when you stop using palm oil and destroying the orangutans habitats. That’s cruelty too

8444 2018-10-30 06:15:08 If you own a car and change oil when you're supposed to, you understand the concept of spending some money today to avoid spending WAY more money later.
Now please apply that logic to environment protection and social services and watch the world get better.

8494 2018-10-30 06:05:54 This is a general reminder that the drive to demonize Venezuela partly stems from the fact they used oil money to buy or pay off other South American countries' debts to the IMF, thus weakening its influence over these countries

8504 2018-10-30 06:03:41 When crude oil is $100/barrel in 2014, GENEROUS PDP govt. spent N14B on Transport, N34B on Agric. & Water, N106B on Power, Works & Housing.

But STINGY Buhari govt. spent N127B on Transport, N130B on Agric. & Water, N325B on Power, Works & Housing in 2017 when oil is $51/barrel.
8505 2018-10-30 06:03:35 Dimensions of the economy get hardly hit by oil product regulations. It then boils down to the effect. How will Kenya be in 5 years?.

Saudi genwrated close to 12 billion USD from hajj pilgrimage , and it's also their one of the source of income after oil. And it has also generated millions of jobs and expanded their tourism industry , we don't mind if we can do even half of it through RAM temple.

No infrastructure on ground to show for it. Nigerians should vote APC to be in power for 16yrs too, we can then compare and contrast

8535 2018-10-30 05:57:55 Many things are renewable. The issue is how long it takes to renew. Coal and oil is renewable if you wait long enough, but that's just a silly way to think.

8537 2018-10-30 05:57:38 Yes, but there aren't enough people who want to oil a snake.
8538 2018-10-30 05:57:29 if speculators were to pile back into the oil market via increasing in net long positioning, the increase in oil prices may be magnified versus the past. After Nov 5 more clarity coming.
8539 2018-10-30 05:57:15 Yes, very bad, it is also fair to say that the other option stole 2 Billion use from the state oil company, and that the former president of Brasil is I'm jail for corruption. They were left with two very bad choices.

8547 2018-10-30 05:55:59 If people in @theSNP wish to publicly label Scotland’s academics as ‘snake oil salesmen’, denigrate aspirational global pioneering democracy technologists, and unwittingly and unfairly call anyone’s integrity into question?

Or Dubai. Very wealthy from oil money.
8553 2018-10-30 05:54:12 Problem with fuel industry is that, world over its run by cartels, the retailers we have are small guys. Even countries which produce their own oil it’s same story.

8555 2018-10-30 05:53:52 My argument is not backed by my plethora of knowledge about the oil field, but by facts and elementary math. Beto never cast a vote supporting a $10 a barrel tax on oil, he simply voted against condemning a proposal related to this issue that never even came to life.

8557 2018-10-30 05:53:36 I am mainly referring to farmers in the third world that don't have access to any other way of powering equipment required for survival, who have some natural crop they can turn into some sort of energy store. I are millions of people on this planet with no way to buy oil.

It's ok for machine oil.
I have no other use for it.
We feed alfalfa mostly...what's available in my region. 

YMMV.
8573 2018-10-30 05:48:22 There is a reason BP,SHELL MOBIL wound up operations and sold assets in Zimbabwe ...ZIDERA ...some of these indigenous oil companies arose as sanction busting measure and as such they had to get state support to operate at the levels these multi national oil companies operated
8574 2018-10-30 05:48:07 1. softer earnings than expected (still good, but as good)
2. inflation expectations edging higher (still super low)
3. public sentiment lurching away from big-tech (eg, proposed digital tax in UK, privacy mess, etc.)
and market generally too: China (tariffs), Saudi (oil).

8614 2018-10-30 05:40:39 I know but dosage, even in oil form not 100% accurate. That’s the problem with dispensaries (and when there is no clinical trials & approval). To me, it’s a hit & miss. Not something I’ll be willing to ‘legalise’, IMO lah

8754 2018-10-30 05:10:19 Roughly half of the current Tmpl goes to wash. St cherry point refinery, gets refined then gets sold back to canada. That is fact. Bc used to have 7 refineries, now only 2. Oil companies dont care about jobs or people, just money. Capitalism at its finest.

8788 2018-10-30 05:04:05 Yes! I literally can’t recommend it enough! My school stress was making me anxious as hell. It even helped me feel focus & energized.

9054 2018-10-30 04:15:44 They should have never said yes to begin with. It isn’t like Saudi Arabia has JUST TURNED into a human rights cesspool. That’s been their M.O. for millennia. 

We in the West are unfortunate slaves to the oil under their sand.

9089 2018-10-30 04:10:02 You know the most annoying thing in #rdr2? You can watch your compatriots clean their guns in camp, but you can't get to the gun menu to do so yourself. So you're stuck, in the middle of nowhere (usually on horseback) with gun oil and a rag like you're homeless. Gangless. Unloved
9090 2018-10-30 04:09:53 I would gladly fill up my car at $2/litre if we didn't get any unrefined tar sands oil coming through bc. More motivation for all of us to buy electric cars, powered by clean hydro power. Careful what you wish for.
9091 2018-10-30 04:09:49 Well, Zinke has an “International Wildlife Conservation Council” (also known as Trophies on the Wall Council). Zinke's love for oil-gas-coal is only rivaled by his love of trophies & those macho hunters who go after easy kills.

9110 2018-10-30 04:06:50 Are you saying we should expand the carbon economy even more rapidly? The Environmental Sciences and Global Development Sectors are warnings about that approach. Do you think that the reductive thinking in organisational psychology has been corrupted by big oil money.
9111 2018-10-30 04:06:49 First of all you, a $10 tax would throw more wrenches into the oil and gas industry than you can imagine, second of all, the bill supporting the global warming theory was a bunch of BS. DM me if you want to tell me more about the dangers of global warming. I’d love to hear it.
9112 2018-10-30 04:06:49 @chineseembassy This is why China will never be the world leader so covets. Chinese are still primitive, ignorant barbarians stuck on snake oil medicine and superstition. Your massacre of wild species is abhorrent to the World and is heinous crime.

9148 2018-10-30 03:59:58 It’s because our media is owned by US hedge funds. Start following feeds all over the globe on “Twitter” of all places. Our oil dominated media is like oil; stop buying gas & eventually they’ll either change or go completely away.
9149 2018-10-30 03:59:56 right now he has Petrol and crude oil.. the day it finishes off... i assure you that he will lead the midnight Mass to celebrate Christ's birthday... if he is such a follower of sharia and islam... why doesnt he adopts couple of thousand syrians or rohingyas...

9151 2018-10-30 03:59:48 I don't know about you but I would prefer lower taxes to build these other things that are "eco" to have more water for the whole state and to open chevron and other oil companies to offer more grants and scholarships especially for my two kids.

9157 2018-10-30 03:59:00 Poor policy choices by @JustinTrudeau @gmbutts @cathmckenna and the rest of the @liberal_party are forcing more crude oil onto rail every day. Pipelines are a safer and more efficient way to transport CDN crude. #KillBillC69 @SenateCA

9169 2018-10-30 03:57:10 He talks the talk but he literally just bought a pipeline, with our tax money, to transport the filthiest oil on the planet. Not a chance we’ll meet our climate targets with them building new pipelines.

9308 2018-10-30 03:36:22 JELIS did not use mineral oil as placebo and showed 19% RRR in MACE with 1.8g EPA. There goes your mineral oil not inert theory straight to the garbage can! $AMRN

9310 2018-10-30 03:35:55 Girl it all depends on what your hair likes but shea moisture and auntie jackie’s does it for me, with a hint of cantu, but not eeeveryday. Everyday use for me is african pride olive miracle leave in andddd moisturizer (two diff bottles) and a splash of argon oil here and there.
9311 2018-10-30 03:35:46 Lol how did you cheat....its better to learn the stuff ...you finish the paper quicker too
9312 2018-10-30 03:35:32 Oh, I know fish curry but It did not look like fish in that oil and gravy. Btw, I don’t eat non veg (animal cruelty istam ledu) but I used to cook chicken for my dog in India  my folks eat non veg though.
9313 2018-10-30 03:35:29 It’s all of the above. Attendance really dropped when oil prices dropped. It just coincided with a couple losing seasons. We’re working on the winning but we never adjusted prices to the economy
9314 2018-10-30 03:35:15 This Shea Moisture bath, body, and massage oil got me smelling so good
9315 2018-10-30 03:35:08 Yes ,  instead of using your shaving cream or whatever you use . Use the coconut oil instead and pat dry your body off after you shower then moisturize your body with it
9316 2018-10-30 03:35:02 To be preselected into the IPALNP, there is an unspoken law. You need to be a carpet bagger, snake oil salesman, white collar crim, happy clapper or an incompetent  mercenary. There are no decent people in this mob. None.

9324 2018-10-30 03:33:13 Precisely. They must have realized that 2 of the top Iran oil importers have agreed to trade in their national currency for oil, China and India. So the whole purpose of sanctions is invalid if both sellers and buyers have negligible effect coz of that.

9334 2018-10-30 03:31:40 Funny. Those who obstruct Alberta’s Ethical Oil also hate Trump. Funny that making Trump’s USA richer w Canadian oil discounts will help Trump get re-elected.
9335 2018-10-30 03:31:23 If you fry a small handful of ikan bilis in a teaspoon of oil and add water after it's fried, you can make a very easy basic stock for noodles and fishcake that's a fraction of the time it takes to make other stocks

9338 2018-10-30 03:31:11 Been a long, rough day but I'm feeling better and testing out some of this midnight oil.
9339 2018-10-30 03:30:46 Mix 2 tablespoons kiwi with 11 lbs dumplings. Add generous amounts of Olive Oil. Bake for 30 minutes at 200 degrees. Serve on a bed of pasta
9340 2018-10-30 03:30:45 Wrestling in a kiddie pool full of it. Less bad for the pores and a bit easier to wash off than baby oil.
9341 2018-10-30 03:30:43 Have you tried a moisturizing cleanser? It’s probably your cleanser that’s drying you out not the Micellar water. I had that issue as well. I was using Ole Hendrickson Oil Control cleanser and it was too much. I switched to Cerave moisturizing cleanser.
9342 2018-10-30 03:30:40 Put the money from all levels of governments into oil industry, such as a refinery?

9350 2018-10-30 03:29:34 So what’s the healthiest cooking oil to cook rice , eggs and other things with? Just curious

9358 2018-10-30 03:28:31 gonna try that but not with all that damn oil 
9359 2018-10-30 03:28:30 Please ask to Mr. sambit Patra,

How he become ONGC director after being a doctor?

What does he know about crude oil drilling, price structures, import of crude etc ?

When does he work ? 

What are his job timings?
9360 2018-10-30 03:28:26 While the @oneplus 6T's fingerprint on display tech looks awesome, a question where no one seemed to ask is, what happens if your face or hands are super oily? Does it still work? Would the oil interfere?
9361 2018-10-30 03:28:20 At least I could get 32 croissants and 4 litres of olive oil for the flight
9362 2018-10-30 03:27:53 If you cook Chinese food with anything other than vegetable oil... shame
9363 2018-10-30 03:27:50 How about we all unite and tell ALL CANDIDATES- R and D, that we won’t accept their LIES ANYMORE! Leave Syria alone, Make it illegal to b on Genie oil board, and NO money from RU Oligarchs like Obama, McCain and half of congress! End our friendship w Saudi!
9364 2018-10-30 03:27:49 Hey, it’s cool if you wanna give GE and Apple your tax money so others can insure their families.  Sad reality is that you could wind up needing a gofundme to cover the cost of care for yourself or a child. You wouldn’t be the first. But so long as oil companies get their tax
9365 2018-10-30 03:27:47 cooking twitter anyone have any favourite recipes that dont involve like disgusting amounts of oil... like making soup

9368 2018-10-30 03:27:27 Since we are still talking about the 45th anniversary of the 1973 embargo, (The oil Weapon)

Let us settle this once and for all: 

Who is more dependent on oil:
9369 2018-10-30 03:27:23 We need to become oil independent.
9370 2018-10-30 03:27:14 Avacado oil for that high smoke point.
9371 2018-10-30 03:27:00 I went over to visit and I was like “where you supposed to put the oil in?” Lmfaoo
9372 2018-10-30 03:26:50 This cold is so harsh on my skin and coconut oil isn't helping at all!!! What do I do?
9373 2018-10-30 03:26:49 Oily fish > Fish oil
9374 2018-10-30 03:26:45 Yes. Loaner.  Wish it was mine! My sedan is in the shop getting an oil change and having a repair done.
9375 2018-10-30 03:26:33 I got the tiniest splash of hot oil on my hand and the only way i can explain the level of bitch I’m being is when Michael Scott stepped on a George Foreman grill and thought he was handicapped after
9376 2018-10-30 03:26:27 Wow. Oils have to be one of the best things created. Olive oil, Argan oil, avocado oil, vitamin E, monoi oil, caster. Magnificent
9377 2018-10-30 03:26:15 The oil got on my chin and now it burnssss
9378 2018-10-30 03:26:10 They will discover oil in Florida?
9379 2018-10-30 03:25:50 Should I go up to Boston Wednesday for the Red Sox parade and cancel my oil change or should I just skip the Boston trip & get the oil change 
9380 2018-10-30 03:25:48 Lord, thank you for this day. Protect me & my family as we rest tonight. Wake us up in the morning feeling renewed in our spirit. Send fresh oil to us while we are sleeping, we need to be RENEWED Father God. Give us strength to stand firm in your word. In Jesus name, AMEN.

9384 2018-10-30 03:25:23 You’re supposed to dilute it for skin! With like coconut oil
9385 2018-10-30 03:25:11 My super expensive Aesop essential oil that I put in our humidifier gives me a crazy headache. But I will use that $#!+ til the last drop because I’ve NEVER splurged like that in something so ridiculously unnecessary.

9388 2018-10-30 03:24:43 

Coincidentally, a fellow grey-bearder asked if I used a beard oil/balm and while I said no (currently), I immediately thought of you. I need to place an order. How can I?
9389 2018-10-30 03:24:23 You can't fry with olive oil it's got a low smoke point. It turns carcinogenic fast when you fry/cook with it. Asides from that it's awesome.
9390 2018-10-30 03:24:10 OK, y’all have heard we say “but it’s a dry heat” for our summers in Arizona, right? Well, summers are different, ranging up to 120 degrees. But it is dry. So you sweat, but you don’t get wet. We keep our fish oil capsule jars open. Three away the lid? No problem! Salt pours.
9391 2018-10-30 03:23:59 But is there a connection between the oil and the effect it would have if it ruined your car.
Let’s say the oil is a quality experience, so the lesser the quality the worse the experience. Do you think our experiences now can effect our soul once it changes to the next body?
9392 2018-10-30 03:23:54 I suppose so, but try to keep it clean. Be careful with the flour and oil…
9393 2018-10-30 03:23:53 Try a salve or edible or a confection ,you might like vaping the oil. Its many ways to medicate E,just medicate Just like all medicine is not for all people same with cannabis IMO what I may like you may not and vice versa.Some strains not for the feint of heart some are etc.
9394 2018-10-30 03:23:36 Not sure what wh ppl ashy skin would look like, but I use a mixture of Cera Ve + aloe gel + avocado oil all over. If I don’t after every shower, I move around in my own personal cloud of dead flaking skin. Gross & disgusting!

9401 2018-10-30 03:22:11 @xlogger42 there is nothing dirtier than a big ball of oil.
9402 2018-10-30 03:22:09 There are a lot more media sources than CNN, MSNBC, Fox, WSJ, NYT. 
There ARE honest media outlets who AREN’T owned by the same oligarchs who own big oil, big phama and big data. 
There are some GREAT independent and alternative media outlets.

Why did they consider oil price important for one option and not the other? Lacks any form of logic. These cats were rookies!

9416 2018-10-30 03:19:48 We value the right of property owners aka mineral rights owners to say no to oil and gas companies. To say they want to keep their minerals in the ground.
9417 2018-10-30 03:19:47 And like I mentioned to you, so what? The oil industry is culpable just like these other companies. They are all screwing us with the full cooperation of political parties. So we need to ask why? Also vote out folks who screw us. @JustinTrudeau @liberal_party Change BIA pronto.

9423 2018-10-30 03:18:44 This is not certain, because there are a lot of plants in China, whether it is peanuts or cotton. The amount of imported food will not be very large. The composition of edible oil in China is very complicated, not only pure peanut oil but also rapeseed oil. Blend oil, olive oil,
9424 2018-10-30 03:18:13 A white female doctor told me to put coconut oil in my coochie when I HAD had a yeast infection and she wouldnt give me meds. I told her I was super uncomfortable she told me it was probably nothing. I had to make another appt with another doctor to get the medicine I needed.

9431 2018-10-30 03:17:02 First time I’ve seen a  operation mentioned, good on ELLXF for branching out to APAC. I have a feeling CBD will be big in beauty products across Asia soon enough... FYI China does grow the half the worlds hemp in just two provinces, and CBD oil is theoretically legal already.
9432 2018-10-30 03:16:51 Aaahhhhh just had the Nice Guy Pampering Shower & Shave. Extra Hot Water,  Beard Oil, Hair oil/ leave in conditioner. Feeling Fresh and Clean and Ready to Go for Tomorrow lol
9433 2018-10-30 03:16:50 I see ,the high demand of oil from my home .
9434 2018-10-30 03:16:48 I just did an exfoliating mask in the shower so I didn’t have to make a mess trying to get it off in the sink. Only problem in that was that it tasted like sugar and oil and it got in my mouth!! But other than that it was life changing!!!

9438 2018-10-30 03:16:07 Look at the trajectory of drilling on private (NOT federal) lands over the same period—it’s awfully similar. The oil price up $20/bbl is a way bigger deal than the sage grouse.
9439 2018-10-30 03:15:46 I note that Harper was responsible for this deal. Company did the splitting of assets. Nice. We can't take them to court. So it has to be written off. Now imagine the same deal with the oil industry. Bigger bill. And our kids will pay for it. Nice set up. Wage slaves pay for it.

9450 2018-10-30 03:14:22 “Outside the Bubble: on the Road with Alexandra Pelosi” was the longest hour of my life, but I am better watching it...10/10.

9483 2018-10-30 03:08:36 Actually it’s supposed to be 30 secs with cars since 2010 I believe other wise you can strip the oil away from engines cylinders and pistons
9484 2018-10-30 03:08:32 Of course hun. Starters know your skin type, oily or dry, know what end result u want to archive (removal of. Blackheads and scars, even skin tone, balanced blemish of oil or reduction of oil levels). Find a soap and toner that your skin type covers always use cotton wool
9485 2018-10-30 03:08:28 @BrendanSchaub Keep your head up man and take it one day at a time. Everything will be fine. Tons of research showing positive results with low doses of cbd oil. 
9486 2018-10-30 03:08:13 Producers would curtail their production by the royalty amount. Royalty is mostly paid in-kind (ie: in oil). Less production = lower WCS diff.

9583 2018-10-30 02:54:12 Also, we already have the Kochs and NRA, oil and gas, and that lot buying elections. Competition would just run the prices up.
9584 2018-10-30 02:54:09 Denver, protecting the environment is very important, but 112 will put so many of our neighbors out of work. It's not just the oil workers it's the cities and towns that exist bc of those workers. They are families, young and old. Have compassion and protect them. Thank you
9585 2018-10-30 02:54:07 Defenses are so strong people are having to spend 10k+ in oil Troops/planes just to take a 2k oil base. 
Attacking is the worst way to get resources now. If things go perfectly you can break even. 
Only way this makes sense is if troop tactics become MUCH more accessible for f2p.

9590 2018-10-30 02:53:33 Jojoba oil is bomb too! My ash is there it just blends in with my peachy skin
9591 2018-10-30 02:53:15 oil your cats with piss
9592 2018-10-30 02:53:04 The secret to happiness is to see all the marvels of the world, and never to forget the drops of oil on the spoon.
9593 2018-10-30 02:53:01 That is all he got. Has the snake oil salesman  all way says sad.
9594 2018-10-30 02:52:57 Like 2min max depends on your motor oil...
9595 2018-10-30 02:52:49 Let’s get this 1/4 ounce active dry yeast, 2-1/4 cups warm water 110° to 115°, 3 tablespoons sugar, 1 tablespoon salt, 2 tablespoons canola oil, 6-1/4 to 6-3/4 cups all-purpose flour
9596 2018-10-30 02:52:37 You can find bag balm at Walgreens! But I also love to use coconut oil and our pup loves it!!
9597 2018-10-30 02:51:42 You just triggered multiple earthquakes in Lancashire . Please hit the other side or the fracking might get stopped and that would really piss off the Tories and the Oil industry. Oh WTH carry on
9598 2018-10-30 02:51:31 virgin coconut oil??
9599 2018-10-30 02:51:29 has she tried #cannabis oil high in CBD.... might help with pain and mood
9600 2018-10-30 02:50:52 Does appear George may have been unwittingly a key player and duped.
Why else would these ppl that knew each other, all travelled in same intel circles needed him? They really didn't if it wasn't some nefarious plot of diversion and subterfuge.
9601 2018-10-30 02:50:48 I have been wanting to cook palm oil jollof, but I always get lazy. I’ll probably just do it tomorrow or Wednesday
9602 2018-10-30 02:50:28 Camera lenses packed in oil. Can be set to target a projectile, vehicle or a specific personnel. Usually aimed at strong vehicles. Target personnel and command centers could be nearby.
9603 2018-10-30 02:50:08 Bili ka tea tree oil banek sa body shop
9604 2018-10-30 02:50:07 Justin,  the climate is warming, but man is not the cause.  How else do you explain the Roman and Medieval warming which were warmer than we are today?  It's the sun. There is no way renewable energy will create more jobs than oil and gas in Canada.
9605 2018-10-30 02:50:05 i was in a car accident a week ago and been having bad headaches ever since so my dad goes i have marijuana oil that i can put on your neck and as he was saying it i was closing my door but i snatched it open so fast soon as i heard that he was like “wow” and started rolling 
9606 2018-10-30 02:50:02 I shaved my legs with baby oil gel and my legs feel like SILK  win
9607 2018-10-30 02:49:58 Oil, low heat, wait
9608 2018-10-30 02:49:30 Cut back on eating animals n animal products not eating w palm oil recycling.. it sucks cuz these creatures don’t have a voice we can understand but we can see they are suffering but yet we r doing what advertising n consumerism wants to survive n yet this is what we get 
9609 2018-10-30 02:49:23 Definitely would be a good option for many of these remote towns (even as just an additional power source), once it’s in place, it is there! Versus shipping oil, etc. How do they perform in the winter? How much does ice impact their performance?

9614 2018-10-30 02:48:29 Mrs May is the snake oil salesman who promised that her monkey was magical and could turn into a unicorn. It turns out the monkey was not consulted before the promise was made and Mr Hammond still isn't a unicorn.
9615 2018-10-30 02:48:26 Will do. Would you like an oil change while I'm at it?
9616 2018-10-30 02:48:16 The crap oil that comes out if AG isnt stopped ,revenues will stay the same .read the bill educate yourself. Chevron's talking points are a lie
9617 2018-10-30 02:47:59 And I said that calling anyone a wingnut is offensive. Roy is nice. He actually had skin in the game. He worked in the oil industry.
9618 2018-10-30 02:47:55 Acupuncture, massage, CBD oil?
9619 2018-10-30 02:47:19 sell oil は通じないけど add oil は通じるなぁ
9620 2018-10-30 02:47:16 Epsom soak and rub on some arnica oil.
9621 2018-10-30 02:47:07 That's the only job she will ever have after this snake oil salesman is out of there. Where did she work before this nightmare?  Does any one know where she work before she became a paid kiss but for 45 ?
9622 2018-10-30 02:47:05 Why y'all jerk off in the shower? Cum becomes a mess with water, its just like oil. can't get along.
9623 2018-10-30 02:46:47 For my birthday I want olive oil and burrata. That is all.
9624 2018-10-30 02:46:39 Interrogative... With Iranian Crude Sanctions Lurking... How can Crude Oil Prices, Brent/WTI, Keep Falling?  Is the "Fix" in?
9625 2018-10-30 02:46:34 
9626 2018-10-30 02:46:26 Kaz I don’t think blowing up an oil refinery is how you stop it from leaking but go off I guess
9627 2018-10-30 02:46:08 They are going down to discover crude oil
9628 2018-10-30 02:46:02 Like u weren't alive when Nigeria plunged into recession, due to fall in oil prices.

9635 2018-10-30 02:45:10 coconut oil is a pore clogger so it’s definitely not helping your face . it will make it break out more. but try and use a kojic acid soap bar. morning & night to help with scaring
9636 2018-10-30 02:45:02 Si!!! Era inconcebible que un país con el potencial energético de Argentina, importáramos gas,  petróleo, Fuel Oil, etc. Generando una salida de divisas por estas compras asociadas a la corrupción K . Bien Hecho!!! Presidente @mauriciomacri
9637 2018-10-30 02:44:59 Its  not the retailers muppet,  its the big oil companies
9638 2018-10-30 02:44:46 @Swamy39 Indian govt pandering to Saudis, buying more oil from them despite Kashoggi dismemberment, raif badawi & othrs imprisonment, aid to Pak of $6 bln without terror clauses, treatment of Indian muslim workers as slaves is despicable. @narendramodi @SushmaSwaraj @TarekFatah
9639 2018-10-30 02:44:20 Looks like the pet has become bigger than the master. A clear sign that "we can strike anyone anywhere in your country .. forego this to have cheap oil and military tenders"
9640 2018-10-30 02:43:56 I'm a HUGE #energy bull at these oil prices due to what can be learned by examining the correlation between #oil prices and US #recessions.
9641 2018-10-30 02:43:46 jay inslee saying “what the oil companies are saying is just baloney” is a very good ad and i want more of this content in my political sphere
9642 2018-10-30 02:43:34 Emily Blunt as Mary Poppins???? Wow not even Jamaican Black Castor oil can save my edges this time
9643 2018-10-30 02:43:30 chewing gum (mint) helped me!! or peppermint oil helps me with nausea as well as headaches!! 
9644 2018-10-30 02:43:27 You don’t know the cost of the oil in my Alabaster box
9645 2018-10-30 02:43:17 No bacon this time! Though that’s also always a hit. 

Light olive oil, roasted until they start to blacken, then add just a bit of salt, pepper, parsley, tarragon, paprika, garlic and onion powder.
9646 2018-10-30 02:43:10 The oil boom actually exploded this city....  

It's actually decent now, and they have a killer BBQ place called bones...  looking forward to that tomorrow...
9647 2018-10-30 02:42:56 Things made of carbon: gasoline, diesel, natural gas, wood, bread, wine, beer, plastics, sugar, peanut butter, polyester cloth, styrene, methanol, flour, corn, paint, carpet, pencils, furniture, flooring, Tylenol, whiskey, socks, vegetable oil, apples, paper....
9648 2018-10-30 02:42:54 My bedroom smells like freshly squeezed oranges!

I heard the orange essential oil is good for happiness & optimism, so I'm hoping putting it in my diffuser (instead of my usual lavender) will induce some happy dreams or ya know, anything else that's not a nightmare/night-terror.
9649 2018-10-30 02:42:36 Americans seem to be OK with corporate welfare for oil and gas companies, banks, car companies, etc.

9655 2018-10-30 02:41:04 it’s ok, that’s why they’re rated top 10 in the world based on happiness :/ i’m glad to hear you finally graduated high school. try not to be a snake oil salesman.
9656 2018-10-30 02:40:38 This new peppermint oil taste like bad mint bush
9657 2018-10-30 02:40:36 HAHAHAHAHA LAGYAN MONG OIL TAPOS PRITO MO
9658 2018-10-30 02:40:35 Try Amlactin, the lactic acid is already in the lotion. I have super dry (white) skin in the winter and this works. Also use coconut oil.
9659 2018-10-30 02:40:34 Respectfully, that’s an oversimplification. The strategic direction for the oil (& antiquities etc) funding  was identified & evolved through both administrations. Trump deserves respect as a contributor, but not the panacea.
9660 2018-10-30 02:40:19 they should be fined for all the oil and pollution in the water
9661 2018-10-30 02:40:15 Florida has oil????

9663 2018-10-30 02:40:03 One of my final wishes is to be made into cooking oil, then prepared into a dish for my enemies so they can eat me
9664 2018-10-30 02:39:53 Some of us white ppl with the tight curly hair have ashy skin too... I could soak in a vat of oil & in 2 hrs I would be getting  dry again.

9670 2018-10-30 02:39:05 Oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly Oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off buildings. Please share to @vancouverpride why you want the world to buy #bloodoil  obstructing Trans Mountain = killing #LGBTQ
9671 2018-10-30 02:39:04 Did not check your oil or H2O
9672 2018-10-30 02:39:04 I love you Sir.  You spoke out about hemp/CBD oil when it wasn't popular.  Nothing else has helped my mental/physical issues more in decades without the terrible side effects from dozens of synthetic pills.  Thank you.

9677 2018-10-30 02:38:13 Yep...got rid of clean water, clean air. Is set to ruin national parks by allowing oil drilling..coal sludge in our water. Doing away with pre existing conditions, worker protections..aren't you proud of hurting our children & grandchildren!
9678 2018-10-30 02:38:12 To speed up hair growth, add a few drops of rosemary oil to your shampoo
9679 2018-10-30 02:38:01 Your a retard, if they didn't find oil in your state you would never have been elected, you a never trumpet and a vile Democratic.
9680 2018-10-30 02:37:49 These food experts keep changing their stance all the time.Sometimes coffee,chocolates,coke,coconut oil are not good for health. Then they become life savers.Coconut oil was bashed for the longest time and now it's the safest cooking oil.
9681 2018-10-30 02:37:36 Made pie crusts using coconut oil for the first time and baked an apple pie. The crust is flaky, sweet, and smells faintly of coconut. This might be the best pie I’ve ever made.
9682 2018-10-30 02:37:32 Woke? Perhaps he feels some guilt for helping to build both the ideological and news apparati that led us here, but probably just bummed neo-cons & Tea Party are no longer in charge of the party that led us into a war for oil and promoted endless bigoted/sexist policies.
9683 2018-10-30 02:37:17 Load up on antioxidants an olive oil mixed with hint of grape juice or red wine not in excess, sea salt or regular iodized Decaff, baking soda 3 tsp. Per day. Lemon 1/2 squeezed in hot water mixed with sour honey b17 banannas 1Thess5:17 Pray without ceasing.
9684 2018-10-30 02:37:10 this reminds me in the early 1900 when the state sued Standard Oil for monopoly practices and unfair competition 

I wonder if this is going to happed now, with twitter, facebook and the silicon valley cartel

9686 2018-10-30 02:36:29 Nuclear power is really good. The US needs to be pumping more and more oil, we need to be energy independent. Dems are like someone saying smoking will cause cancer, but then they keep smoking.

9700 2018-10-30 02:34:33 It took Diess about 3 months to fire his crooked underling at Audi, after he was arrested. 

People speculate that Big Oil funds the shorts and this ridiculous FUD, but I would bet that the sick culture at VW is comfortable pulling strings behind the scenes to discredit Tesla.

9714 2018-10-30 02:31:59 domestic repercussions & capital outflows likely outweigh gain - oil import bill would rise dangerously, capital flight ... scars of 2015 run deep & aim for internationalization& trade settlement of RMB requires stability. In ST PBOC will aim for stability

9717 2018-10-30 02:31:16 That was a quote by Benjamin Franklin.  Maybe those who burn the midnight oil have less interruptions. Thus more time to process and retain information.  I'm just a late night stoner who graduated a yr early. What do I know

9723 2018-10-30 02:30:42 This ban on shipping Alberta oil, along with C69, and all Canadian pipelines being dead, means that the oil and gas industry in Canada is dead. That not only means empty office towers in Calgary but big cuts coming to bring Alberta percapita spending in line with other provinces.

9736 2018-10-30 02:28:36 Tonight I met a person who suggested I might be able to avoid my scheduled gum graft for severe gum recession by oil pulling. Oil pulling. What is the polite response because I was literally dumbfounded.

9773 2018-10-30 02:24:07 hopefully I can get it all fixed before it rains, I'd hate for this car to be ruined before it has its first oil change

9775 2018-10-30 02:23:59 Witch hazel breaks me out and I prefer coconut oil for both.. but my overnight moisturizer is what I change doing seasons. But by it not being cold my face don’t dry out like normal.. it’s confusing to explain Kml !

9779 2018-10-30 02:23:17 Besides hating Trump he’s probably pissed that Trump allowed the completion of 2 pipelines & the opening of oil drilling in Alaska & around the country on federal land. His hedge funds are losing big money on his bet to invest in alternative fuels.

9782 2018-10-30 02:22:54 Slice em in half, mix in a bowl with some olive oil with salt pepper garlic. Bake at 450 for 12 minutes. Take em out, mix with juice from half a lemon and 2 tbsp of melted butter. They were fantastic.

9789 2018-10-30 02:21:35 There's a "Vote No on 1631" ad sponsored by a bunch of oil companies. Would you guess that the bill is aimed at reducing green house gases? Also too funny, the ad claims it exempts major polluters - and gives - oooh! - exactly one example. #YesOn1631

9795 2018-10-30 02:20:50 Surely eor works but at what price and how much can be invested at what return?  I get it.  Low decline, high oil cut. No current transport or basis issues. Leverage cuts both ways. Pvac had leverage and convexity from strong growth. Bad deal for their shareholders.
9796 2018-10-30 02:20:45 there is no left or right... time to wake up. your three industries in power. oil and military with a couple of rogue technical companies. see how the multinational corporation structure stripped you poor and unable to survive and took over congress. Trump knows exactly. he $$$

9798 2018-10-30 02:20:21 This makes sense I ordered oil (20 minutes after midnight Oct17). Still no shipping email!

9800 2018-10-30 02:20:06 In 1953, Iran's democratically elected president tried to nationalize the oil industry. The CIA promptly staged a coup & installed the unpopular authoritarian Shah, who was a U.S. puppet. In 1979, the Shah was overthrown in a revolution that turned Iran into an Islamic Republic.

9802 2018-10-30 02:19:21 You can check the price of oil on the ticker. It came down almost .70 just since I noticed it. Gas has gone from $2.97 to $2.52 because of the price of oil. But in the country, the 3 gas stations we have know they are the only 3 so they have raised to 2.57, but oil is still down.
9803 2018-10-30 02:19:17 行こうと思ってください？？？
9804 2018-10-30 02:19:11 literally just had the same issue. You can use clarifying shampoo or oil+conditioner. I used Ion’s Clarifying Shampoo. Rub it into the cap, let it sit for about 15 minutes. You’ll have to be extremely gentle removing it but it will come off. Wash/deep condition after its removed
9805 2018-10-30 02:19:08 Tea tree oil smells so damn strong but I gotta get this face right

9821 2018-10-30 02:17:26 Found out my vet emailed the results to my kitty’s urinalysis last Tuesday. Which I didn’t see until she called me today. The results were good and now she wants me to try hemp oil for anxiety & inflammation. 

Time to do some research this week.

9840 2018-10-30 02:15:09 1. Rwanda & Croatia were genocides
2. USA's main beef w/ Iran's govt is that American oil companies lost their contracts on Iranian oil in 1979. That's literally it. These sanctions&concern trolling4"human rights" r just sour grapes.The US helped Saddam w/chemical weapons vs Iran

9845 2018-10-30 02:14:05 not if fried properly. it shouldnt absorb any oil at all since the steam inside should keep oil from getting in.

9851 2018-10-30 02:13:21 My skin is normal to dry so I have to put oil on it. My winter skin care routine is completely different from my summer routine so it’s just all messed up by the inconsistent weather. 
9852 2018-10-30 02:13:18 Sad especially when just across the border the USA is booming and we are sitting on the worlds third largest oil reserves and a over abundance of coal but we have a useless, clueless, not ready groper leader in office
9853 2018-10-30 02:13:15 Ur reply was true 10 yrs ago w the Petrol dollar cycle. But US is a top3 oil producer, and Saudis have to borrow money in recent years.
9854 2018-10-30 02:13:06 How about Democrats all chose for themselves to stop using oil, gas, and plastic products? Bill Gates uses more oil/gas in a day than a normal person uses in a whole year.
9855 2018-10-30 02:13:06 Honestly I can’t wait to go to SMU so I can give tours of the George Bush library and expose the REAL tea that I learned from being a part owner of that “oil company”

9857 2018-10-30 02:12:57 There was a recent ad involving two people on a date, and a large man using the male dater's facial oil to oil his muscular body.

For those who've seen the ad, can you recall the brand it was for without Googling?
9858 2018-10-30 02:12:57 Just need a good shower and ritual burning of the oil merch and you will be a new man
9859 2018-10-30 02:12:48 There is no logic. Birol is just projecting what he and many other wants on the energy market. They want an abundance of oil without actually paying for extracting it. Well, I want money without working for it but that doesn't mean I am gonna get it.
9860 2018-10-30 02:12:48 Yessss. I’ve been like this lately and have been wanting to try cbd oil.

9886 2018-10-30 02:08:25 Why do Democrats, who believe in world ending man caused Climate Change, continue to use oil, gas, and plastic products everyday? Democrats can all start walking and riding bikes tomorrow, but they all refuse to. Their CC solution is just a way to control other people.
9887 2018-10-30 02:07:54 Wouldn’t one argue that those jobs lost to oil and gas will be gained during that same period in the renewable energy sector? Wouldn’t a law such as this help oil and gas transition their budgets to more sustainable energy development? It may create more than 150K jobs.

9892 2018-10-30 02:06:58 As a result of what appears to be a loan given to a company with less assets than liabilities, both @atbfinancial loses cash for the public and @YourAlberta loses cash for the public. Sweet deal if you can get this set up for oil companies. Individual bankruptcy less sweet deal.
9893 2018-10-30 02:06:56 It’s crazy how you can be sitting in your own corner drinking water and using coconut oil daily and someone will still try to draw you out and start something!
9894 2018-10-30 02:06:37 The global synchronized growth has come this far because of lower oil prices.. and now is at risk
9895 2018-10-30 02:06:32 I have to find the perfect air wic essential oil mist thingy
9896 2018-10-30 02:06:30 Some people use a roller of it, and roll in their head, or an oil diffuser or a few drops on your clothing to inhale it!
9897 2018-10-30 02:06:14 The goat grumbles and starts to rummage through his bag. Gabe takes out a small glass vial of purple liquid and uncorks it with a twist of the hand and a soft pop. A thick scent began to fill the air.

The bottle contained oil from the plant Aconitum napellus. Wolfsbane.
9898 2018-10-30 02:06:08 some nights you're a gourmand and some nights you so deeply don't care to leave the house that your dinner ends up being a bowl of honey peanuts, five mini twix and a quesadilla fried in coconut oil bc you are out of butter
9899 2018-10-30 02:06:04 Oil is also a big help! For those with longer hair. Coconut oil is great, it will stay oil close to your scalp, helping to keep your hair from wicking away needed moisture, further away it will thicken up and help give hold and bounce!
9900 2018-10-30 02:06:04 When was America's foreign policy a symbol of moral leadership? When it invaded Iraq for the oil? Was it on display during the 20th century where it toppled elected governments and funded death squads throughout Latin America?
9901 2018-10-30 02:06:03 For shareholders not willing to dig deep, this looks bad.  But in reality, this is great for the main reason why shareholders buy DNR, for its high beta exposure to oil.

9907 2018-10-30 02:05:32 Wow.  Totally got me.  Thanks for the glorious information that completely does not counteract the other sources of information that vary up to 1.5 billion.  Thanks, though.  Also, snake oil, great ages-old saying.  Very clever.
9908 2018-10-30 02:05:31 Instructions

1. Mix together coconut oil and ground coffee and apply to your face using circular motions. Avoid getting the mixture in your eyes, nose and mouth.

2. Leave on for at least 15 minutes up to an hour.

3. Rinse off with warm water and enjoy your glowing skin!

9913 2018-10-30 02:04:40 There’s glue remover in hair stores. I forgot what it’s called but Ik they have it. I also read that you could leave dish washing liquid on for an hour and that should help ease the glue out but oil also helps. But next time use a protectant

9917 2018-10-30 02:04:07 $AMRN Did your Reduce-It study CONCLUSIVELY evaluate and prove that mineral oil didnot affect the absorption of statins? Not if but when FDA asks for the data, can you prove conclusively the same? All fish oils are not equal, ALL PLACEBO'S ARE NOT INERT!!!

9927 2018-10-30 02:02:55 Marijuana helps my mom take less painkillers... Same with my brothers wife. It also helps my dad with arthritis.

CBD oil is also a good one. Doesn't get you high or anything but seems to help lots of people. My mom and sister in law also take cbd oil prescribed.

9929 2018-10-30 02:02:38 You are just another Socialist dem loser. If Texans want jobs in the oil Industry & in Natural gas they'll vote for Cruz. Why would anyone vote for a Socialist democrat who hates American's, who wants to enabel open borders, take your money to pay support to illegal invaders?

9933 2018-10-30 02:02:28 Wowsers!  Did end-of-day spending check, after reporting earlier that Big Oil had raised $29.922 million against I-1631.  By 6 p.m., however, the record spending was up to $31.229 million. Are they worried?

9941 2018-10-30 02:00:23 As a white van, I am not afraid of the stickers on my windows, but of the oil change I have not received.

Regardless of what you use, I hope you get some relief.
9981 2018-10-30 01:54:05 The US has spent $7 trillion destroying the middle east. We have NOTHING to show for it. Not even the oil we force our society to use and we steal from other countries for the profit of a few...
9982 2018-10-30 01:53:59 Oil companies are cautious but they appear to be cautious to protect their bottom lines. I doubt that there is any real accountability for the companies when they do wrong as the AER is fairly useless. Citizens don't seem to get helps but a runaround typical of @YourAlberta
