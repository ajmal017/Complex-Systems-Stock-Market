1 2018-11-26 23:59:56 超サラリーマン的な立ち回りの背景にはこういう制度設計になってることがままあるのかなと思います。なら成功報酬型にすればいいじゃん！と言うほどシンプルな話でもないので、根は深いかもしれませんね。
2 2018-11-26 23:59:39 Did you buy crypto with money you needed?  You're stupid.
3 2018-11-26 23:59:22 Yes agreed, Craig the imposter
4 2018-11-26 23:59:12 I do not think any of us can. I was waiting for .20 and now look at this ish! I first said .24, let that pass, got greedy and wanted .20 and we are pumping and I still haven't added to my bag...ugh!!!
5 2018-11-26 23:59:08 That’s the beauty about bitcoin, it can drop as low as it wants and rebound as high as it wants. It doesn’t lug around any debts, doesn’t answer to a board of directors and doesn’t need to meet quarterly profits. You cannot bankrupt it! Bitcoin Answers to one including TA!
6 2018-11-26 23:58:51 They're only doing this because it's obvious lots of U.S. Bitcoin/crypto users haven't been paying taxes last couple years. They don't care what you pay with so long as they get the dollar value of taxes you owe them.
7 2018-11-26 23:58:09 Nice! I’ll check it out

10 2018-11-26 23:57:42 I said 3-6 months unless $3k breaks.
11 2018-11-26 23:57:41 crypto has taught me that people are willing to waste ridiculous sums of capital on stupid ideas... and yet still I'm surprised
12 2018-11-26 23:57:41 Re the recent event-stream vulnerability:

them: "have you found out what the code does"
me: please don't be crypto please don't be crypto please don't be crypto please don't be crypto
them: "it's crytpo".

of course it is
13 2018-11-26 23:57:36 Hahahahaha
14 2018-11-26 23:57:26 Don’t get me wrong, it is a well handy bit of kit, but subtle it ain’t. A delicate little trojan doing its crypto mining or credential stealing job is much more gentlemanly.
15 2018-11-26 23:57:17 there is one I admire but this one is not a case
16 2018-11-26 23:57:03 Year end bonus time!  #Crypto
17 2018-11-26 23:56:37 He said right wing. Not crypto-leftists.
18 2018-11-26 23:56:35 The $crypto standard is inevitable 

Although largely bashed for being a scam $LGD was ahead of its time 

Strippers will have barcodes in the future
