40 2019-04-15 23:42:42 TIL: 

Metatrader 5 isn’t an upgrade of Metatrader 4

MT4 is for forex and MT5 is for access to CFDs, stocks, and futures

Not sure if this is common knowledge or not
41 2019-04-15 23:42:31 If you are an investor in marijuana stocks, do you chuckle at 420 puns?
42 2019-04-15 23:41:52 Interesting you should say that. I am a seasoned options trader and it appeared that the trades lasted only a few seconds, and would “sink.” I then got tired of taking small losses, and took a rest. Even stocks that were “pushed under water!” I have $VXXB .. con’t ..
43 2019-04-15 23:41:34 Bah j’ai un petit frère et y a une machine j’ai oublié le nom qui permet de « traitre » le lait pour avoir des stocks de biberons genre 
J’ai senti c’était horrible et j’ai gouté encore plus horrible
44 2019-04-15 23:41:21 Nope, I have no issues with you spending your money on whatever you want, but there are better tools out there than bump stocks.

When I was in combat my M4 only had safe, semi and 3rd burst, no full auto.
45 2019-04-15 23:41:05 It's tax day, so we've been asking our members what they would do if they had a few hundred extra $$$ from Working Families Tax Credit — paid for by a capital gains tax that would apply to big profits on things like selling stocks & bonds. Thread on what we're hearing… #waleg
46 2019-04-15 23:40:23 Woke money dies in the stock market as well. That was the point of mentioning penny stocks.
47 2019-04-15 23:39:26 I’d prefer my return to be 0. That means I’m withholding the correct amount and not giving the government interest free loan with my money. Sure it looks great getting back a return. But I’d rather have 50-100 a month in my stocks making returns for me then sitting in dc.
48 2019-04-15 23:39:12 and still be fiscally responsible.  Kinda like Dubya did.  Trump is replaying the same old failed policies.  Well, at least we know what he means by AGAIN.  The Bush years.  At least corporations have been able to temporarily keep stocks high with stock buybacks.
49 2019-04-15 23:38:10 Pay off my debtsz invest a percentage into stocks. Save the rest

51 2019-04-15 23:34:58 I would pay off my parents debt and then put the rest in a high interest bank account and invest in safe stocks to pay for my kids futures.
52 2019-04-15 23:33:29 Other than the fact that you don't need a bump stock to bump fire an AR. I'm sorry but bump stocks are pretty worthless and I would never waste my money on one.
53 2019-04-15 23:32:54 Relatively extreme hypothetical: if i manage to double the amount I go in with, do you suppose it's safe enough, assuming i have impulse control, to forbid myself from touching the original amount and reinvest the rest? My friend did that with his stocks and it worked out okay.
54 2019-04-15 23:32:30 Thanks for the heads-up, didn't come across them in my research. Do you have access to US markets? Looks like Rubicon Organics also trades with the ticker ROMJF on the US Over-the-Counter market. It's what we call an American Depository Receipt (ADR), which many stocks have.
55 2019-04-15 23:32:27 Stocks and bonds up on my list 
56 2019-04-15 23:31:44 He sold “some” of his stocks, not all his stocks, per the article. The 25,000 in debt is nonsense.
57 2019-04-15 23:31:40 Corporations received a huge tax cut with many corporations paying zero.

What did the Corporations do with their windfall, they bought back stocks. 

Wages stagnated. 
Did not create new jobs. 

@realDonaldTrump still has not released is taxes.

59 2019-04-15 23:30:08 Thanks so much. That's great news. Trading stocks now w/ just my country's companies is very limiting.

If you were me, would you choose Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Sogotrade or TD Ameritrade as a very long time online broker (20 years and beyond). Which one has bonds & ETF? Thx
60 2019-04-15 23:30:00 Stocks in downward channel, much more likely to see $250 retest before anything w/ a 3 handle. To me the question is does $250 hold after the ER??

66 2019-04-15 23:26:37 I do see the point you’re trying to make. 

All I’m saying is having learnt from my past, some stocks are never worthy of touching. Never. That’s just me. 

The majority sided with your POV so that’s that lol
67 2019-04-15 23:25:50 And THEN it turns out that those CEOs have the majority of their life savings in the dominant, competing herring company stocks.

80 2019-04-15 23:14:27 Typical CT investment portfolio: shitcoins, pot stocks, uranium, and tesla. literally nothing with stable steady growth. Think about that for a second.
81 2019-04-15 23:14:03 For DK in general I'd make punch charge carry over in stocks like beam or waft
82 2019-04-15 23:13:54 I expect higher lows on pkg but who knows this market is completely crazy. Certain stocks  can suddenly have 0 value especially stocks with no profitability on cse. Cash move to gold stocks and dividends stock. Its always a sign of bad things coming
83 2019-04-15 23:13:50 The Dem socialists strike me as conducting an assault on the investments of middle class Americans, our IRAs, 401Ks, annuities, our savings, and/or stocks. Now why in the world would a political party wanting our vote do that to us? They have to answer up for this assault.

89 2019-04-15 23:09:17 Yes the system tries to teach people to save money in a savings account for a rainy day when it's purchasing power is worth a lot less. Either that or we have to risk our own money to invest in funds, etfs, common stocks, bonds etc just to try to maintain its purchasing power

108 2019-04-15 22:53:11 By far the most sweeping firearms confiscation program enacted in recent years was Trump’s bump stock ban, which turned hundreds of thousands of formerly law-abiding gun owners into federal criminals if they refused to destroy or surrenders their bump stocks

119 2019-04-15 22:45:52 You have to stop worrying about Lyft, you advise people to invest in index stocks, you repeatedly talk about risks, suitability and time frames. If they’ve invested their mad money in Lyft they can afford to wait until it rebounds. Give yourself a pass.

126 2019-04-15 22:39:21 And they won’t tell, so we will be left to guess. I will guess that either they waited after 420 tweet to find the right exit or this was tied to a strategic move away from risky / tech stocks during the December sell off. But just a guess.

133 2019-04-15 22:35:11 Yep! Some goes to my savings and some goes to stocks and my 401k. Technically I'm saving but I could do more.

136 2019-04-15 22:33:24 Disgusting. Not surprising. Time for tar and feather and stocks. Rotten tomatoes for this guy. These beasts don’t deserve to have women in their lives.
137 2019-04-15 22:33:24 I've seen stocks with higher dividend yields. Wyd bro??
138 2019-04-15 22:32:56 its all disengenious bullshit becauase it takes 10 seconds to understand theres a difference between a boss stealing all the wealth created by his employees or a landlord being a parasite than a guy who puts his senate salary into stocks lol
139 2019-04-15 22:32:34 US stocks eased by around 0.1% overnight. Keep in mind this is the S&P 500's 1st fall in 4 days & just the 2nd tumble in 13 sessions. Stocks remain near 6-month highs & just 1.2% away from all-time highs #markets
140 2019-04-15 22:30:57 @jimcramer I read the WSJ daily and am reading intelligent investor. Got 100 month I can put towards the stocks. Stocks or ETF to start?
141 2019-04-15 22:30:21 You mean a gap to the upside needs to close.  I misunderstood you. We opened at .40 touched .30 closed at .37 so I was scratching my head where you saw a gap.  Thanks.
142 2019-04-15 22:29:27 I have a "scout" short position from the mid-50's...  I'd be happier with it back under $58, but here we are...
Can honestly say, did not expect it to more than double in 2 months...  :-/
Seems it really took the "stocks only go up in this great economy" BS to heart...

146 2019-04-15 22:26:27 Ya I like that strategy - buy the breakouts and take super small losses because chances are, when MJ stocks do work, they rally +10%, when they lose, you can pretty much already tell it ain't going to be THAT TYPE OF DAY quite quickly. Take the 3k profits and the 200 losers. R&R

153 2019-04-15 22:16:43 I would agree, its not totally without merit, in fact in stocks its proven time and time again. If we could exclude people that can direct the market with there actions i would be more trusting of it. Time will come though.

157 2019-04-15 22:13:16 ask Lou why Trump thought it was more important to sugar high stocks with tax cuts we cant afford, is it cause he is an old wind bag cocker who could care less bout the countrys debt? he seemed to care when Obama was in power resulting in sequesters, which they tossed out window
158 2019-04-15 22:12:44 No
159 2019-04-15 22:12:13 You lied to the American people to benefit your stocks and lobbyists and now you continue to blame the party that wasn’t in power when you pushed through tax cuts for corporate welfare. The GOP is burying itself.

163 2019-04-15 22:08:09 Russia doesn’t trade at anywhere near the discount Mebane implies- it is nearly all currency driven. MICEX is at an all time high and up almost as much as SPX since GFC low in ruble terms. I don’t understand making the “CAPE” argument for Russian stocks but ignoring currency
164 2019-04-15 22:08:00 If Hunter and Jerome do get drafted, they made a wise decision. Hunter most likely. Jerome a good chance   Their stocks couldn’t be higher and honestly what’s left to accomplish at UVA?
165 2019-04-15 22:05:35 Today's gap down, I got you, I wouldn't be too concerned over that. They put all the news out and we uplist and this will be over $1 in the blink of an eye...
166 2019-04-15 22:04:31 It’s an art form for sure. Fussing with trigger mechanics can be a real rabbit hole, as can bedding stocks or optics mounts
167 2019-04-15 22:04:07 I am assuming you are comparing these in US dollar terms? Almost all of the disparity is currency driven and MICEX is at an all time high and up over 4x’s since GFC low in ruble terms. Russian stocks aren’t cheap but the ruble sure is.
168 2019-04-15 22:03:07 After reading "Red Notice" a few years back, Russian stocks deserve their "corruption" discount. Why invest in a market with non-transparent accounting and politics?

181 2019-04-15 21:50:00 The reality of the meat and products from animals has never been attractive. I believe the time has come for meat alternatives, that do not hurt our sensibilities, to dominate with ethical food. To pick up the responsibility of replacing stocks.

187 2019-04-15 21:46:34 Thanks! I agree that when certain factors are accounted for, Buffett’s skill in picking stocks and timing the market can be questioned. However that does not take away from his abilities as an investor!

190 2019-04-15 21:44:19 OR we could implement a WEALTH tax, because billionaires have more than they could ever consume and they make their money by purchasing assets like stocks, bonds, and real estate. 

Everyone consumes. Not everyone buys millions of dollars in stocks and bonds.

192 2019-04-15 21:42:09 Billion dollar companies making record profits got a tax break. They didn't give out raises they bought back stocks. The working and retired people suffer. If the people thought they could trust Trump and the repubs they were sadly mistaken.
193 2019-04-15 21:41:14 You wanna learn about stocks
194 2019-04-15 21:41:13 You are not the sharpest knife in the drawer bud. Do you have stocks in anything? That provides your extra income. Well I do. Only Trump has come to our aid. Im an elitist I guess in Middle America.

199 2019-04-15 21:34:14 Just to clarify, I consider etfs and mutual funds stocks!  But yes I tend to be more risky knowing you can always work a little longer if there is a downturn.  Plus if you are always investing you put money in at the bottom as well

242 2019-04-15 21:09:48 Yep I feel it 100%. The pk boys in general have a horrible rep solely off of online players and no actual skill and people upset about losing to them but praise top players that use them. We gotta just brush it off and take those stocks.

267 2019-04-15 20:57:18 Clueless. Been in the stock market for 30+ years. Stocks go down about every 10 years and have always gone up and recovered the losses. Make good choices in your stocks/bonds.

270 2019-04-15 20:48:10 LOL there are no gaps on the chart. Every gap has been filled along the way. Whoever is controlling the action has made a perfect pattern here without any real pullbacks. Volume has been very minimal and short lived on this move...
271 2019-04-15 20:47:58 2017 was utter ass basically. The shit they pulled was /gross/. It all lead to a bunch of companies buying back their stock basically (while they promised the "savings" would go to employees...none of it did) and they anticipated an economic boost through this...stocks fell.

277 2019-04-15 20:43:09 By S/D y mean general supply / demand. I think we'll get a better idea of supply/ demand at the end of 2020. Personally, am bullish on U stocks, have a b&h approach, and will decide exit strategy end of 2020 (or will have better idea what to do then).

281 2019-04-15 20:39:13 The situation has deteriorated to a point where calling it "assets" seems rather far-fetched! This holds especially for unicorns, FANG stocks, and the like, most of which have near zero liquidatable asset value (except for a few logo copyrights, hap-hazardly contrived patents).
282 2019-04-15 20:38:05 Of course, I really like the company. I just don’t this manipulative trading Im seeing in a lot of stocks.

315 2019-04-15 20:17:26 go to shareholders and not to labor force.  Corps also use profits to buy back stocks driving stock price higher - adding wealth to stockholders.  Finally most stockholders outside the US as are a lot of corps so those profits don't stay in US and are not invested in US economy.
316 2019-04-15 20:17:13 Curious about markets, trading big board stocks. I wanted to know if there was a science behind it and gravitated to TA
317 2019-04-15 20:17:01 So I keep seeing “this coin will be this much money by year 20XX”....If all we are wanting to do is gain fiat, basically cash out at some point, what’s the point of crypto at the moment? We are treating coins completely like stocks.

373 2019-04-15 19:44:54 all my friends - no matter how great a stock is if the sector hype is gone in cannabis it won't work. Many of you are tilted/disappointed and think a stock that didn't run +100% shouldn't pull back the same magnitude - that's logic, but not how stocks trade. Buy when clear. $tilt
374 2019-04-15 19:44:16 I agree with you but for some reason QTR is always on the wrong side 100% of the time.  He trashes stocks, they skyrocket. He buys OSTK it crashes 80%.  He's bearish on LYFT so it will soar soon.

384 2019-04-15 19:37:12 Lets lower the appraisal cap down to ZERO. Treat real estate like stocks. Capital Gains is taxed on the profit at the sale of stock. Real Estate should be no different. Local Govt should not been getting rich off of phony appraisal creep.

394 2019-04-15 19:30:15 My rough calculations (incl pig iron, port stocks, imports, not incl mills stocks) show CN ore import dependency started dropping sometime 2018.
ie recent CN mines ore output growth is understated by NBS, and CN ore output growth began BEFORE Vale+AU weather supply crunch.
395 2019-04-15 19:29:16 With red ≈5k $/day since end Feb (minimal ore spot cargoes into CN, only ore on longterm contracts), ore port stocks must keep dropping like stone. If they don't drop, then current hyped ore demand from steel mills is overrated and/or CN iron ore mines come back strong.

523 2019-04-15 18:19:43 yes, my holdings are shown here in Zerodha. However, I purchased stocks via ICICI Net banking account and anyone can. You just need to mention DP ID while purchasing so that they get reflected in zerodha account. Direct purchasing fron Zerodha is nt possible.
524 2019-04-15 18:19:40 With Option Buying, its really the reverse logic that could work. Instead of wanting to do Option buying & going looking for index/stocks, it is better to employ this, when you definitely know (fundamentally/technically) a stock could scale up new heights in a month or so

530 2019-04-15 18:17:33 So that statement is a lie. After the car companies and banks got bailed out you know what they did? They bought stocks in their own companies and artificially inflated the market. They still laid off people they still moved towards more slave like labor.

744 2019-04-15 16:30:38 With first-quarter earnings season hitting its stride, "the half-full or half-empty" question depends on whether or not stocks can continue to beat analyst expectations.  Other questions: how will consumer confidence, wage growth, and job creation fare in Q2?

750 2019-04-15 16:28:00 Correct but most inv today do not believ stocks belong lower and when they do sell off it was a mistake and they'll mak new ATH. 12/26  - YTD reaffirmed this for them. They are wrong, the fed and POTUS is reckless implying this, but thst is the battle. Why bother, why protect?
751 2019-04-15 16:28:00 Hassett wrote that book 20 years ago, in 1999. The central thesis is that stocks were undervalued. Everyone who invests/follows the market remembers 2000.

1. Is today's market under- or over-valued?
2. Counterfactual: Would the market have been valued more with better policy?

867 2019-04-15 15:39:30 The capitalization in car industry is about 1/3 of revenues. Generously overlooking Tesla negative profit margin, 1/3 revenues expected in 2019 is some 5 billion. Divide by 170 million stocks to get $30 per stock. Reduce by 30% due to clearly lower expected profit margin. $20

935 2019-04-15 15:08:42 A credible commitment by the ECB to buy as many financial assets, bonds, stocks, real estate, foreign exchange, to hit a nominal GDP growth rate of 5-6% could help. Unfortunately, open ended QE is not very popular with the German electorate

1025 2019-04-15 14:27:25 I've never been a day trader (stocks) but I imagine buying cards of "hot" players is similar.

1027 2019-04-15 14:27:05 Multiples are like a blind squirrel that sometimes finds a nut. GOLDMAN "From a valuation perspective, both S&P 500 and median stock trade at high valuations relative to history. Multiple approaches suggest stocks trade between the 80th and 98th percentile vs. the last 40 years."

Putting my brain in the stocks
1035 2019-04-15 14:23:12 A problem with deals like $LYFT and the never-gonna-make-money $Uber deal is they are pimped as investment-grade.  At best, these are speculative story-stocks.  That's a different animal altogether.  But the VCs, desperate to cash out, need the rubes to think otherwise.
1036 2019-04-15 14:22:53 La comparación correcta del pasivo es con el activo; no con el sueldo, porque no tenes que pagar todo ahora: con ese criterio, cuando te entra la paritaria, debes de golpe menos. Se comparan flujos con flujos (cuota/ingresos) y stocks con stocks (activo con pasivo)
1037 2019-04-15 14:22:31 So glad we have something vs the rats. Good chance of stealing early stocks with this.
1038 2019-04-15 14:21:56 I am a novice in stocks overall 3 yrs in market. IMO, for a starter key is capital preservation. Don't go after quick wins. Look for cagr 6, 8% then 10% and build. No reading of blogs will give you what your person experience gives. So longer you are in the game better you get

1117 2019-04-15 13:53:39 Maybe that's answer- play the game- GIVE people STOCKS, because companies are FORCED, BY LAW, to keep their shareholders happy. Just give people stocks, for free, and let them reap the dividends for the rest of their lives, especially in retirement..like the rich fucks do. #MSNBC
1118 2019-04-15 13:52:11 Hi Jim JPM rocks! Best in Banking and Investment companies. WFC and C are beatings earnings on buybacks with lower revenue growth.  Investors should rotate out of stocks who report lower revenue growth with high buybacks Invest in high revenue and net profit margin stocks!!!

1121 2019-04-15 13:51:22 U.S. stocks were little changed at the opening bell Monday as investors digest earnings reports from Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. Spotify fell in pre-market trading amid reports that Amazon may launch its own free, ad-supported music service. BU-35MO
1122 2019-04-15 13:51:14 @realDonaldTrump Try to convince people who are large bank and company CEOs to buy more stocks than bonds “We are all in bonds” is what @DavidSolomon said in a @GoldmanSachs video a few months ago - this may change perhaps he needs to diversify with his new job but it could help
1123 2019-04-15 13:51:13 come on, John. You know that speculation in stocks is more important than maths. Give the people some fucking numbers and a solid argument. Maybe then this 'paradigm shift' will get out of the fringe.

1128 2019-04-15 13:46:28 Price might go up because 1 pie was "too expensive" and now there are smaller pieces, more people are interested in purchasing them, creating upwards pressure on the price. That is why public companies split stocks right? Not everyone can buy a Berkshire stock.

1144 2019-04-15 13:37:45 RT DiMartinoBooth RT EconguyRosie: Have a look at “Trading Activity Stalls as Stocks Rebound” on B10 of the WSJ. The surge to record highs has occurred on the lightest volumes since last August.   The VIX, as back then, collapsed to 12. Calm before the storm.
1145 2019-04-15 13:37:39 For sure, honestly your best bet it probably to put some money into some blue chip stocks, like apple, Microsoft, intel, etc huge companies. That way you can just sit on it, get used to the markets and not have to worry about taking a huge risk

1228 2019-04-15 13:03:55 I sympathize with your frustration. Given my way, Trump would've been clapped in stocks on the Mall in his first 100 days. But we stand to lose far more than we can gain by acting on outraged feelings instead of hard evidence. 
The latter is being gathered as we tweet. Patience.

1286 2019-04-15 12:34:46 Typically, stocks have a high negative correlation with the US dollar. However, gold has an opposite relationship. The US dollar tends to rally when equities are weak, thus putting downward pressure on gold. This can make gold and its related stocks move in the same direction.

1350 2019-04-15 12:00:59 Great quote that uniquely describes market panics and the resulting quick declines in stocks:
"Those heroes of finance are like beads on a string, when one slips off, the rest follow." - Henrik Ibsen (playwright)
1351 2019-04-15 12:00:33 I’m not sure that’s true. Buffett says that he is 85% Graham and remainder “him”. He’s always erred towards cheap/GARP stocks and has rarely deviated from this approach (except in respect of the odd stock like $KO that he has held for a long time with material latent cap gains).
1352 2019-04-15 12:00:00 $LYFT already started the hot IPO phase of 2019 with a boom & bust. #Pinterest and #Uber will follow soon. Reminds me about 2017 when $SNAP and $SWCH went public and burned through many pockets. Such IPO action can distract from the underlying market which is a plus! #stocks

1357 2019-04-15 11:51:19 #trade Stocks advance ahead of earnings; bonds stable

European stocks rose moderately after progress in the U.S.-China trade talks buoyed sentiment and investors grew somewhat optimistic about the next batch of corporate earnings. Investors are focused on the U.S. earnings …
1358 2019-04-15 11:50:10 Some of us are doing well on our portfolio simply by being intelligent, investing wisely. It might not be much, but I made a 20% gain in my stocks over a week... and I like starwars, Witch has nothing to do with my stock portfolio and never did.

You may be wealthy, and a fool.
1359 2019-04-15 11:49:05 The five most capitalized stocks on NYSE are called the “FAANG”: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google. These are all tech firms & they are companies of the future. At $3.9billion, Jumia is sure worth more than GTB. However, Amazon is worth more than Citi Bank or JP Morgan
1360 2019-04-15 11:48:56 I’m confused. I thought shorts could make a company go bankrupt?  But thank you for confirming that Tesla bulls know at least 3 stocks.

1373 2019-04-15 11:42:08 It's certainly not a crime. It's no crime to own oil and other stocks like he does. The market has had a great 30 years. What's wrong with Sanders is he's always claiming it's evil for someone else to make a speech and give the money to charity. Or to own stocks like he does.

1377 2019-04-15 11:41:04 That’s called inflation, Lisa. We don’t acknowledge it cuz we’re told it’s a neutral phenomenon: a rise in the “general” level of prices. There is no “general” level & it’s not neutral: those who get the printed money 1st, get to buy 1st, at old prices (real estate & stocks).

1389 2019-04-15 11:31:14 The narrative is clearly about China rebound carrying the world economy back up and justifying the H2 rebound. So I guess it is all about Chinese data for the next month. Especially since stocks that lower estimates dont even go down...

1418 2019-04-15 11:08:09 Just seems a very lazy thing that the media/commentators always add in Brexit.  It is because they have a lot of knowledge on Brexit so can easily add a few paragraphs on it.  It means they miss interesting global trends that actually drive stocks/markets.

1478 2019-04-15 10:10:31 I understand your point, but this is something which is managed and governed by the marketing team.

1509 2019-04-15 09:42:39 Haven't seen FN-6s in Libya by militias and it wasn't know to be in Qaddafi stocks. Corcksrew effect typically associated with older FSU MANPADS i.e. Strela-pattern. Possible it could be newer generation MANPADS, i.e. Igla-pattern or Pakistani Anza-II - both observed in Libya.
1510 2019-04-15 09:42:10 I read that and thought the same thing. Investing in a company, in a pension wrapper, that owns out of town retail parks isn’t the same exposure to property as having a buy to let in your own name.
1511 2019-04-15 09:41:32 None of which I'm disputing. However we are bound to EU and must buy certain stocks only from within the EU potentially costing us more than buying externally. Basic supply and demand. We have the demand, as consumers, suppliers may chose to make products affordable...

1672 2019-04-15 06:31:20 Agreed it is undervalued and mismanaged. But two points to note -
1) The stock price jumped from 215 to 310 from 25-Apr-14 to 10-Jun-14. So 310 is not a fair benchmark.
2) All global oil stocks are languishing too - e.g. XOM, Chevron, Conoco Philips.

1682 2019-04-15 06:21:04 In the end it comes down to wealth storage capabilities. Smart money always has the majority invested in assets not fiat (inflation evasion). Once Bitcoin is considered a wealth storing asset, money is flowing into it as natural as into stocks, bonds, Gold and real estate.

1690 2019-04-15 06:11:24 Foreign investors took a slight breather from selling off stocks listed on Bursa Malaysia. The FBM KLCI closed at the 1,624 points, the lowest close since late December 2016.
1691 2019-04-15 06:10:25 With all the buzz around buying this IPO and that IPO, more emphasis should be placed on the downside of picking your own stocks. Most people cannot even imagine losing 50% of their portfolio value & that’s a possibility from time in the market.

1695 2019-04-15 06:08:19 I do not trade in stocks, with technical stops. I invest in companies and hold until either business deteriorates, mgt. goes nuts. Neither has happened yet which is why I'm still invested.

1700 2019-04-15 06:05:33 To flip this on its head, US stocks have been a great diversifier for investors in the rest of the world over the last 30 years.

1720 2019-04-15 05:49:39 @telaholcomb is the TRUTH when it comes to dissecting stocks. You definitely want to follow/friend/work with her. 
1721 2019-04-15 05:48:19 First they have to get rid of the counterfeit electronic stocks.
1722 2019-04-15 05:46:37 Investing in a company should discontinue and be done with after the company is able to be sufficient  enough to buy those stocks back.
1723 2019-04-15 05:44:42 Stocks close slightly slower, trimming earlier losses
1724 2019-04-15 05:44:25 Keep eye on sugar stocks today all look good for fresh upside

1732 2019-04-15 05:34:56 Your breakout may have failed but now recheck is desired for fundamental reason. Auto stocks may have reached at bottom!
1733 2019-04-15 05:34:23 Hey @zerodhaonline, give me one good reason not to switch to @upstox completely. The frequent "issues" are frustrating for anyone. Can't sell stocks! Don't ask me to sell on BSE, there's no volume there. You guys must be earning a lot here, aren't you?

1751 2019-04-15 05:16:47 Agreed. Let's start with (transparent) Privatization. Free Markets.
Private capital, including yours, has an Opportunity Cost. Many millers would sell at a lower price if they have excess stocks. Cashflow.

1760 2019-04-15 05:06:54 Ha , I remember that. He sold stocks that made us billions to show a structural benefit, when the stocks were worth billions more per year than he sold them for. Kind of like when he sold CANDU to SNC Lavalin for $15 Million. It was worth BILLIONS to Canadians.

1788 2019-04-15 04:43:09 Yeah I just think stocks is such a risk because you dump all this money into an investment and you never know when shit will hit the fan and then you lose all that money. I think what I’d do is invest in a small start up company that way if it does fall least u have money

1945 2019-04-15 02:18:09 Can you give details of the plan? Monthly premium, deductible before $1 is covered, then what’s covered after deductible? Also, why do you think healthcare stocks went up after the #ACA was signed? possibly because they liked government forcing individuals to purchase it?
1946 2019-04-15 02:18:04 I’ll keep silent just like how they were when it came to bump stocks

1956 2019-04-15 02:10:59 The stockmarket is a lie. Stocks are over inflated because they are being bought back by companies buying back stock. A recession is coming folks....

1968 2019-04-15 01:59:51 I think it’s hilarious when he states she’s passed no meaningful legislation. You mean like the Republican lead House & Senate these last 8 years? The two years where he could have created legislative policy he did what? Bump stocks and sentence reform. Seems almost Democratic 
1969 2019-04-15 01:58:06 It isn’t complicated. Trump wants stocks up so he can win in 2020. Fed capitulated. ECB thinks they can save the day. But fundamentals are rolling over.

2043 2019-04-15 00:37:12 In any event, the point (perhaps the most overlooked point in investing these days), is that stocks have NOT in fact outperformed long Treasuries...they’ve underperformed the long bond by a large margin over the past 20 years.

2066 2019-04-15 00:22:05 Boring? No. Exhausting? Yes. It's so deliciously exciting we hate to miss a single minute, but alas we have other stocks to watch and private assets to track. If Elon could be just a little more sparing in his insanity, we could definitely boost our productivity.
