42 2018-04-26 23:54:52 In fact, in the 1800s most ppl didn’t trust “surgeons” because they mostly peddled snake oil. When scientists invented the light bulb etc, they became heroes. In a clever re-branding, physicians adopted the white coat and “doctor” title, and road their coattails to public trust.

77 2018-04-26 23:48:23 My oil comes from a domestic pipeline right here in Alberta. No one in Canada will be served by this pipeline. Unless you consider it will just get shipped down to the US and sold back to us.

88 2018-04-26 23:46:07 It’s not as simple as big oil is taking all the money and overpricing it. Taxes and the process California makes you do is a lot of it.

110 2018-04-26 23:42:40 Crude or not crude we started fracking to lower our prices, and "have our own supply if it runs dry everywhere else" but in reality it was just another avenue to get oil cheaper for the billionaires. Now theyre taxing us for it more when were supposed to have more of it.

121 2018-04-26 23:41:36 Can Alberta refine the oil at home instead of shipping unrefined bitumen through our waters? I’d have much less of an issue with it if the oil was refined.
122 2018-04-26 23:41:32 Don't buy it, as is too modern, safe, low maintenance, charge at home and able to travel interstate at low cost. Buy ICE car instead, same old stuff, high maintenance costs, rolls over easy, unsafe in crashes and rely on big oil.

132 2018-04-26 23:40:42 Bro do you realize how much California taxes on gas? Not to mention add on the demand California has for it? Or what about the requirements California has for oil that costs a lot more to process and only lets you process the lighter crude?

147 2018-04-26 23:38:42 THERE WILL BE BLOOD (2008): It's Oil been leading Upton this
148 2018-04-26 23:38:16 You don’t have a clue - no jurisdiction is not A small part - it means everything because if you have no legal standing you cannot have your day in court .  And where exactly would you get your oil from outside of pipelines ?
149 2018-04-26 23:38:15 
150 2018-04-26 23:38:09 Wow it's almost like there' was a big shale oil boom in the US or something duuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.  #Clueless #FlakeNews
151 2018-04-26 23:37:55 Canadian's don't want expansion in the oil industry but all that means is they get left behind
152 2018-04-26 23:37:40 Essential oil’s
153 2018-04-26 23:37:37 oil can be made from general waist   but when all the fish in the sea are 2 radio active to eat and climate change destroys your crops and makes impossible too grow more and you cant feed the ppl they revolt

158 2018-04-26 23:37:05 Oil is not a net contributor to the economy.  
I completely disagree with everything you are saying about indigenous peoples and have no idea why you would choose this as your 'whataboutism' distraction.
159 2018-04-26 23:36:49 Eric just pointed out the irony of this situation. @HuskyEnergy oil refinery explosion=residents evacuated to @AMSOILINC branded hockey arena! #lovewaternotoil #waterislife #Superior
160 2018-04-26 23:36:46 My sister had a spider infestation in her car. Go get 100% essential peppermint oil. Fill a spray bottle with water and a few drops of the oil and spray the shit out of your car. Spiders HATE peppermint oil. I use it in and outside the house to keep spiders away. It works GREAT!

165 2018-04-26 23:36:32 @WBrettWilson on the CBC this morning writing off the Suzuki foundation’s criticism of the Oil Sands because it has received US funding for the last 20 years. I assume he will be equally as vocal in his dismissal of any @FraserInstitute studies on the benefits of the Oil Sands
166 2018-04-26 23:36:07 I don’t care what the enviromentals are saying and doing. Alberta oil is the best product on the market. If they think by stopping a pipe line through their province is going to make their egos feel great. They better think twice because we will make them fall to their knees

#TheSoftRight 
*agreed. no jobs program, just fracking, big pharma, oil, wars, expanded mass surveillance, Wall St. Russiagate, lamest alibi ever for their own incompetence/corruption.

174 2018-04-26 23:35:24 I say I’m awake but I might fall asleep again bc I took a fish oil capsule
175 2018-04-26 23:35:14 It's something what's going on over in Superior with the oil refinery explosions. Most of the city is under an evacuation notice. I hope everyone stays safe.
176 2018-04-26 23:35:06 Don't pour used cooking oil down the drain. It can be converted into biofuels. Recycle it at Walnut Grove or Eubanks Waste & Recycling Centershttp://ow.ly/8Ja030joNi1
177 2018-04-26 23:34:56 oh no, hun, the Bush presidencies (both) were about profits for their oil companies. The New American Century gang was all Cheney. They're robber barons who squashed technologies that would progress society with alternative energies so they could profit from oil and gas.
178 2018-04-26 23:34:55 I’m game! I just started using a sample of loccitane face cleaning oil instead of my usual cerave moisturizing cleanser. After I shower I use cvs brand pm lotion (Neutrogena copycat) Depending on if my skin is really dry I spot apply Aquaphor, but love the Clinique moisture surge
179 2018-04-26 23:34:55 that is why we have wars where we send 100000s of solders off to Foreign countries with fully automatic weapons and bombs and where 10000s dont return not because of oil not because of freedom not because of a threat but because ppl dont know how to use condoms
180 2018-04-26 23:34:38 Hmm, your P.S. isn't much of a revelation. "I wanted to transform oil wells into money wells pumping money for infinity. [Then] each year one-half of the account’s earnings would be dispersed among Alaska residents. The other half could be used for essential government services.”
181 2018-04-26 23:34:37 We ain’t talking presidents dog. We talking about how mofos wanna shut down oil but don’t have sustainable backup plans.
182 2018-04-26 23:34:16 $5.00 a gallon in Alberta and we have tonnes of oil. Poor us.
183 2018-04-26 23:34:16 What is at risk is our economy, healthcare, jobs, social services ... if we cut off oil where will we get $ for this
184 2018-04-26 23:34:11 protecting oil interests or comercial interests
185 2018-04-26 23:34:11 When we take the initiative and quit getting duped by Snake oil salesmen. Trump is just telling people what his data analytics tell him to say. He is full of shit just like any other politician. He may be beating down the left but that does nothing to help the masses or #MAGA
186 2018-04-26 23:34:03 If I take off early tomorrow a haircut, oil change, movies just might be the plan.
187 2018-04-26 23:33:57 I can’t wear foundation without mixing some type of oil in it.
188 2018-04-26 23:33:42 i almost set oil on fire we r off to a good start

194 2018-04-26 23:33:05 palm oil is not good for custard .. Use hypo, it kills germs
195 2018-04-26 23:32:58 HRT with a testosterone blocker! That is seriously the best thing. But before that, I don't know if I ever figured out anything great for myself other than trying to remember to gently wash my face at night along with a shower in the morning. But testosterone is what makes oil.
196 2018-04-26 23:32:42 Peppermint oil in the diffuser and on your temples
197 2018-04-26 23:32:08 Things that probably sound weird to non-pats: "Dentist appointment at the Lido". Then stopped by the Ritz-Carleton for an oil change, but the housekeeper had a martini waiting for me when I got home...
198 2018-04-26 23:31:41 I need a 2 to 3 1/2hr. conditioner, followed by a hot oil treatment &" a nice hot bath 
199 2018-04-26 23:31:02 Literally up to my elbows in motor oil right now trying to get a working that can make it to NYC for #TtW18

207 2018-04-26 23:29:31 Dont need oil. Sad
208 2018-04-26 23:29:28 Yeah! the larger breast was better, but it was super simple. just salt, pepper, olive oil, and minced garlic for several hours at 149f, then 3min in a hot skillet with oil (skin side down). will try again!
209 2018-04-26 23:29:18 All you’re good for is hurting girls and changing oil 
210 2018-04-26 23:29:16 Lighthouse Riddim  @DjlassAngelVibe mix  while I burn the over-night oil, the month of May is assesments & exams. This road to being a Minerals Extraction Engineer is a tough one.
211 2018-04-26 23:29:13 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
212 2018-04-26 23:29:11 Both ;)
213 2018-04-26 23:28:59 Today my coworker’s granddaughter said her leg hurt and she deadass replied “I’ll put oil on it when we get home.” I cannot.

221 2018-04-26 23:27:26 I’ve been saying 41 was in Dallas/CIA! Cuba rebels gun running oil field days. Look at Prescott ties to Rothschilds & banking, Germany. JFK killed for pull out in Vietnam, EO signed for closing Federal Reserve & using gold/silver certificates. Power Elites would stop at nothing
222 2018-04-26 23:27:23 2.69 for gas, I thought the dreamsicle was suppose 2 be bringing oil back 2 America. Wth happened?
223 2018-04-26 23:27:22 BADDD! & right bitch idgaf how mad you are you can’t pour out the oil 
224 2018-04-26 23:26:55 this project was approved when A)prices of oil were projected to be at $150  not even close today!B) #Alberta didn't have expanded capacity to Louisiana that allowed them to fill #SuperTankers that they now do now which makes the "Light" tankers in BC redundant and unnecessary
225 2018-04-26 23:26:25 2/3then file a court challenge to stop the import of foreign oil and gas into our country then ask Saskatchewan And Manitoba to do the same stop any exports of BC products moving east thru Alberta in other words declare war on BC enough already
226 2018-04-26 23:26:25 Holy shit there was an explosion at an oil refinery close to my campus WHAT
227 2018-04-26 23:26:12 Dear @StephenMoore, defending Scott Pruitt's corrupt behavior is defending the indefensible. You want an EPA chief who doesn't believe in climate change? Fine. You want an EPA chief who's agenda is that of the Oil companies? Fine. Try find one who's not a corrupt liar.
228 2018-04-26 23:25:53 You don’t change your own oil?

230 2018-04-26 23:25:40 Wars have  been fought since humans have been keeping records.
War over oil is only in the modern era.
War is never good for whatever reason. People suffer and die.
Maybe its time robots fight the next war?

232 2018-04-26 23:25:17 Is it the “energy” industry that’s doing the bullying, or the “oil” industry? I think there’s a division somewhere in there.
233 2018-04-26 23:25:02 they probably sweat motor oil eating all that shit smfh
234 2018-04-26 23:24:56 For silky hair, mix 3 parts olive oil and 1 part honey. Put in microwave 30 sec. Apply to damp hair 20 mins with shower cap on. Rinse well!
235 2018-04-26 23:24:37 I been washing my hair a lot because of all the face masks n stuff but now I just put straight olive oil in my hair do u think I should wash this out n then leave them for a couple days or just leave the olive oil in for another day

238 2018-04-26 23:24:16 Coconut oil. Just sayin'. Less mess and just the right viscosity.
239 2018-04-26 23:24:14 Y’all I done finessed my ex for a full tank of gas and an oil change HAHAHA OMFG ! 
240 2018-04-26 23:24:04 I think if BC doesn’t want the pipeline, that’s their right. Look at what the oil is worth when it gets to the coast through a pipeline compared to the lack of pipeline now and whatever the difference is (100 million a day they say), BC can simply pay it to the rest of Canada.
241 2018-04-26 23:24:01 Looking forward to this weekends 50 man WWE Oil Rumble match.  #WWESaudiArabia

Be here all day folks. Tickets at the door still available.
242 2018-04-26 23:24:00 @StephenMoore -- who co-wrote Trump's tax to help the rich -- just called climate change science "drinking the Kool Aid" on @CNN.  @StephenMoore works for the @Heritage Foundation which gets massive donations from oil companies. @StephenMoore  won't dare mention that on @CNN.
243 2018-04-26 23:23:59 I think the APF is a perfect example of a hybrid: Fund itself is socialist, but relies 100% on capitalism to exist. Oil is most definitely a (nominally) free market driven by the profit motive. Flaws of course include externalities and rampant corruption, but still good example.
244 2018-04-26 23:23:57 No legitimate physician has offered them hope of treatment or recovery. Only the opportunity for more time in maintaining him.

No doubt there will be snake oil salesmen and charlatans who offer hope of a “cure” - these are the truly disgusting people.
245 2018-04-26 23:23:48 You’re absolutely right, what a snake oil salesman , peddling fake weight loss miracles, brainwashing his audience, all for profit, what a loser, hope he gets cancelled soon, cause i like you have cancelled him! Shame on you @DrOz

259 2018-04-26 23:21:05 It’s so bomb! I think it’s a bonus because it’s the actual soleil blanc fragrance and you get it in a shimmering oil  worth the price to me. The body lava I’m 50/50 on. It looks GOOD in the light/on camera but at the same time it’s sticky.
260 2018-04-26 23:20:58 I completely agree, however, oil isn't dead either. I over-extended myself in the #lithium sector, however, I do know that at the end of the year, I will be happy. Money cannot run all at the same time! GL

267 2018-04-26 23:19:43 You are the voice Alberta needs today. We have to stand up to governments and organizations that are against Alberta’s oil resources and to promote one of the worlds cleanest oil. Why isn’t BC blocking ships that are bringing dirty oil from other countries?

271 2018-04-26 23:18:58 If you got beef with an unethical Industrial sized company selling grapes, it's hard to rail against them by positioning the word 'Big' before grape. Unlike 'Big Oil,' 'Big Grape,' sounds even friendlier than just Grape!
272 2018-04-26 23:18:58 Hah!  I knew I remembered his Moon Pie face!  He's the Rep. who told the BP Oil exec that his having to testify about that massive underwater oil leak was a "government shakedown".  What an asshat!

275 2018-04-26 23:18:40 Please tell me you dropped the soybean oil. If it’s in this, you need to go back to the drawing board.
276 2018-04-26 23:18:35 I'll check it out. I have just put the question to the Commission... Murray Sherwin didn't want to comment directly on the oil and gas exploration ban when I interviewed him yesterday.

279 2018-04-26 23:18:02 America and its allies need to make the distinction to their respective nations people between “evidence” and “speculation”. Because millions of innocent people are dying in the faux name of democracy but in reality for oil and power. The UN has become useless.
280 2018-04-26 23:17:52 Ooo did you use oil? I remember a friend of mine did this with a bunch of liquids in a cup.
281 2018-04-26 23:17:49 Carl, let’s split a CNBC fantasy team next year? No CLUE what @EricDickerson did today #oil - Bethany totally choked. And those kids that went FB at 1 then DIS?! @timseymour did B- job but he has the hottest partner!
282 2018-04-26 23:17:44 I can crush it up and mix it with an oil to make it a paste. And make it like a mask for you. Get those frown lines outta there.
283 2018-04-26 23:17:44 update on my neo-con copsucking grandpa: “it’s justified to invade countries solely for oil and if civilians are collateral damage in war that suits the american interest” what is life
284 2018-04-26 23:17:37 Mowed the yard, changed my oil, now I’m cooking and my mother brings me four boxes of Little Debbie’s. Good day.
285 2018-04-26 23:17:20 Well really nothing I can do , just oil block the pores. But I’ll keep washing my eyes more with hot water or warm lol. Ha I’m down to 220 lbs now my B/P average 113/75 little better shape now.

288 2018-04-26 23:16:27 So, Lava beat Oil, after all! 
289 2018-04-26 23:16:20 I think the #bcndp work on getting untaxed dirty offshore money out of #VanRE has been great, but I agree, this war on oil is ridiculous, the #CarbonTaxScam is even worse.
290 2018-04-26 23:15:44 Alberta, where I live now, sits on 170B bbl of tar sands oil. If we extract and sell it all, we'll get $1.2T over 35 years. Bank of Canada estimates climate change effects will cost us up to $43 bn/year by 2050, completely negating the gains, and draining the budget.
291 2018-04-26 23:15:34 i suspect the reaction AGAINST the pro west "shah" of iran (under whose rule  people dressed in western clothing) is more what  people mean... but the reaction against his installation (he was put in place to sell the west oil at a discount) is what set off the extremist swing
292 2018-04-26 23:15:33 He went on about the lack of refinery capacity, said he's spoken to WA @GovInslee who has heavy oil capacity to spare. #TransMountain

295 2018-04-26 23:14:45 I knew the Nuclear drama was going to end like this. Who knows maybe there is oil in North Korea or its shore.
296 2018-04-26 23:14:28 Olive oil is fine, it's the industrial seed oils that cause problems.
297 2018-04-26 23:14:24 Currently my future nightmares are about a post revolution world, run by misogynistic Incel Nazis, controlled by a Russian Oligarchy who've convinced them oil is the only way to real power and that the earth resources are infinite. I need to listen to and read some lighter media.
298 2018-04-26 23:14:17 pay 4ur day in court in the end. The oil companies are a false villan. They only produce the energy you & I have needed to live.
299 2018-04-26 23:14:15 Does this mean that if you want to smash a oil flask at a enemy adjacent to you, you must make a d20+dex ( since you are usually not proficient in flask throwing ) with disadvantage ( because you are adjacent to an enemy ) ?
300 2018-04-26 23:14:14 Arnica oil EVERYWHERE down there. Best chance to not get any rips or tears.

303 2018-04-26 23:13:07 We live in an age where everyone wants a quick fix to problems that can't be solved immediately. And sadly the snake oil salesman of Twain's Mississippi River are winning

311 2018-04-26 23:11:42 Hahaha. If you want to hear the policies and promises of Nigerian Recycled politicians go to Chatham House. You will come away with an earful. If you prefer to stay in Nigeria you will not get policy manifestos but you are likely to get rice and cooking oil. The choice is yours.

316 2018-04-26 23:11:03 A duo that barely wins anything. You’re not gonna convince me Ali and Olivia were the better duo to get out. It’s not happening. Maddy and her oil trio of stooges are idiots
317 2018-04-26 23:11:03 This dude on was smoking in the parking lot and said “you in the oil field?” I said “yea man” he’s like “shit you probably get tested a lot I was gonna ask if you wanted to burn one”

323 2018-04-26 23:10:25 It’s wonderful my oil pan keeps getting put on backorder... i don’t need to finish the nova or anything 
324 2018-04-26 23:10:22 Nope. John D. Rockefeller was when the gov't broke up Standard Oil. He was worth roughly $600 billion in today's dollars. 

Currently richest person on the planet is Putin. Worth around $100 to $200 billion.

326 2018-04-26 23:10:14 I wonder if oil is “discovered” in the battle grounds at Gettysburg would they drill? Just asking is all.

329 2018-04-26 23:09:55 I’m wondering if anyone in the US used CBD oil from Industrialized Hemp. #cbd #cbdoil #hemp

331 2018-04-26 23:09:33 "every doctor who has examined him has reached the same conclusion"
you are of course referring to the doctors who incorrectly said he would die 5 minutes after being taken off the ventilator, correct?
332 2018-04-26 23:09:15 Speculators buy big blocks of oil outright or futures, then park the tankers offshore thereby shorting supply until the price goes up.  Trump tweeted about it, may have been a subtle warning to the greedy wankers.
333 2018-04-26 23:09:12 Who needs oil when according to geenies rare earth metals for batteries bloom every spring and can be caught in the wind
334 2018-04-26 23:09:01 Yes, it's those same people that drown their veggies in olive oil thinking they are "cleaning" their arteries...not quite!
335 2018-04-26 23:08:57 oil refinery had some explosions and is on fire so much of the town got evacuated.

340 2018-04-26 23:08:14 Sounds like she needs an oil change
341 2018-04-26 23:08:10 I wonder if the Productivity Com removed recommendations on oil/gas from its report due to politics. If it suggests using higher carbon prices to drive change & wants the inclusion of agri in the ETS to be gradual, I can't imagine it would advocate for a sudden exploration ban?
342 2018-04-26 23:08:08 but it is more palitable to say your suing the oil companies & not your fellow citizens. Oil prices will go up & us workers will
343 2018-04-26 23:08:02 I’d sell you my Chill playlist only if an oil + gas company comes with the exchange.

347 2018-04-26 23:07:35 Based on the progress of technology and oil prices and daily mileage, my truck may never depreciate ever.

350 2018-04-26 23:07:07 If they don’t make a “garlic sauteeing in olive oil” car air freshener they really should.
351 2018-04-26 23:07:05 Yes. And tax payers subsiding the oil industry that makes billions on their own every year is too.
352 2018-04-26 23:07:00 Agreed

We had a line break coming down from a single point futo. I was only a few inches off the ground so no injury, but our policy is now
1. use biners on anything that will take heavy load or be raised or lowered a lot
2. replace rope every 6mos or so
3. Oil & inspect often
353 2018-04-26 23:06:52 Steel beams don’t melt without controlled demolition!  Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
354 2018-04-26 23:06:43 Dinner of a flowering burger (A baked hamburger with a sunny side egg)  with cucumber slices, and toasted potato wedges in place of pickles and fries which I can't eat due to the oil or seasoning. Not bad but wish I could have ketchup.

Ugh. Referring to the preservation and protection of land and sacred spaces as an “abuse” ... gloating about “local voices” when we’ve seen proof this was about oil and gas. Gross.
Thanks for the reminder that you’re the worst.

360 2018-04-26 23:06:17 Now is the time for everything. We have a president/establishment that is pro oil, pro gas, pro coal. If they have it their way and if we don't have serious discussions now then it's only going to get worse. We need to have the conversations to move forward in a better direction

362 2018-04-26 23:05:54 CAPP needs to do more for the Oil and Gas Industry other than the occasional tweet! Your clients pay you significant dolllars for membership. Need higher profile from CAPP! Educate Canadians on the economic benefits and spin off affects!
363 2018-04-26 23:05:43 I feel like the real reason we don't invest into renewable energy is because we like having interests in the middle east for oil, and so we have "official" personal reasons to jump into war and regulate other nations.
364 2018-04-26 23:05:30 Nah people can find oil in somewhere else (Argentina;Canada;US;Africa;Russia).

368 2018-04-26 23:05:07 We know better. Your thoughts are with the Koch brothers and the oil industry and the checks they send you.
369 2018-04-26 23:04:58 We measure upstream emmisions from Canadian industry but omit things like tanker fuel consumption on imported oil. Why is that?

419 2018-04-26 22:58:53 @Kia first you don't pay my registration for the length of the lease then ask me to "check in" every 1k miles when my car is burning oil and have it towed in when the oil light comes on #Kia #getreal #towthis #notmykia #fixthis

421 2018-04-26 22:58:31 I don't doubt the aspects of a spill, the original pipeline has been in operation since the 50's, without spills, my thinking is, this isn't gonna end well, being in SK, we cannot continue to be  land locked!! In a oil sense
422 2018-04-26 22:58:30 Fox 21 News will continue through 6:30p with coverage of the Husky Energy oil refinery explosion and fire.
423 2018-04-26 22:58:30 Hmm, an artist that loves corporate/fossil fuel pollution? That’s what that MAGA hat represents. So are you a truly an artist or just an avaricious ego like @realDonaldTrump, where $$$/fame has blocked access to wisdom? “Love everyone” but endorse big oil, plastic and toxicity?
424 2018-04-26 22:58:24 For those of you who aren’t mechanically intelligent oil changes are important, don’t change your oil your car will take a dump.

426 2018-04-26 22:58:10 Me.
427 2018-04-26 22:57:42 Perhaps a national energy policy that encourages 21st century energy technologies (as opposed to coal and oil). And how about modifying the GDP so the metrics of such innovation match real world advances and benefits.
428 2018-04-26 22:57:40 @Nawti_kaff  Pls give  @shakara_babe  Lumapil ultra for her bitterness.she also needs to treat the pains and injuries she sustained as a result of too much envy & jealousy eating up her veins.also give her small portion of the remaining Bam Oil you used for the last patient.

431 2018-04-26 22:56:51 I get people don't like NHL playoff format but enough w/ the whining already. It's nothing new & it cost many a Winnipeg Jets team to be bounced in the 1st round for the better part of a decade in the 80's. There is no perfect or easy solution...unless they go to a balanced sked.
432 2018-04-26 22:56:38 Worcestershire sauce + olive oil + crushed red pepper marinade
433 2018-04-26 22:56:35 Try Ninas Almeria Gold Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil from Spain milled in a Organic Cold Press and get all the health back !!!
434 2018-04-26 22:56:34 Then I second Emily’s argan oil Rex (although don’t put it too close to your eyes.) You can get super cheap argan oil at Deciem (The Ordinary brand.) They have an online store.
435 2018-04-26 22:56:27 So I went got my oil changed, y’all. It was 42ish but I had a coupon and they claim it would be more because of my type of vehicle. Long story short, my dad went over there and cut up and my next oil change will be free!!! 
436 2018-04-26 22:56:18 somehow worse. Perhaps they'll find a way to nominate the oil baron from the Simpsons
437 2018-04-26 22:56:18 He needs the lies so he can seize Irag oil later on.
438 2018-04-26 22:56:06 Had 3 baths in baby oil and scrubbing trying to remove these spray tans.. fuck it looking like crusty bread it is

440 2018-04-26 22:55:44 Parts of my area are being evacuated due to an oil plant explosion, oof.
441 2018-04-26 22:55:44 Oil change and carwash 
442 2018-04-26 22:55:43 ....and no secret it is that western leaders -in their role as sisters of charity- provided weapons and a juicy business with stolen oil from Syria, to EMPOWER dissidents (which when financed are called?=mercenaries) and make a mess which keeps killing and exporting innocents.
443 2018-04-26 22:55:42 yogurt, limon juice, some garlic, olive oil...sometimes they add cucumber, in this case it’s like a greek tzatziki sauce. It’s amazing 
444 2018-04-26 22:55:23 Cbd oil???
445 2018-04-26 22:55:19 my jar of coconut oil melted - we can verify summer is coming.
446 2018-04-26 22:55:11 I dry some, freeze some, freeze some in olive oil... Make pesto, repot some to keep indoors, trim the tops off some to just grow in water on the windowsill.... Toss some in my chicken coop...

452 2018-04-26 22:53:27 Protecting community important - gives competitive advantage in a field where, in absence of regulation, anyone can do it - also gives signal in field of noise setting end customer quality expectations That’s how you discredit the snake oil - you set the bar, define standard
453 2018-04-26 22:53:22 Naturally all the Reps from the oil and gas producing states are going to laud Pruitt as having "great integrity" when in reality he is ensnared in corruption and undermining the very goals & objectives of the EPA.

459 2018-04-26 22:51:59 International companies moving investment to more friendly jurisdictions is hardly a sign of impending doom. Thats why the US has now approved KXL a direct line to the gulf coast and refineries designed to refine heavy oil lol ya Im the uninformed one.

475 2018-04-26 22:49:55 1/4 - There are a few key issues at play. Rising electricity costs, blackouts or no access to power and the potentially devastating toll on the planet the burning of coal, oil and gas can have on the Earth’s atmosphere.

490 2018-04-26 22:47:50 I’m with you on that. The little red squirrels in Fairbanks were kamikaze death machines. Not so bad in Anchorage for some reason. Biggest problem I have here, other than cars, is bad humans with dogs, and the early-season, but short-lived corporate oil executive MAMIL bloom.
491 2018-04-26 22:47:26 Check their contract with Premier Oil. Good chance the study was successful and the next step would be a trial deployment this year per the pr in Jan.

495 2018-04-26 22:46:57 They are on staff and are constantly taking soil samples and water samples. Not only in the oilsands but on drilling sites as well. That is something you will not learn by reading anti oil propoganda. Some of the brightest minds from universities find employment in the oilfield

501 2018-04-26 22:46:06 She used laser treatment but... exfoliate before you wax and use coconut oil and exfoliate again after waxing. someone mentioned grape seed oil but coconut oil works just as good and it's cheaper
502 2018-04-26 22:46:03 That’s not true. Other countries are investing in alternatives bc it’s better for the environment and majority of scientists all around the world have proven the harmful effects of using natural resources like burning coal/oil and global warming. Plus I want free energy.

558 2018-04-26 22:39:37 Anybody ask @POTUS why gasoline prices are so high? I imagined Trump's #MAGA would have low fuel prices due to all that extra oil we're producing & the great deals he's making for us.
559 2018-04-26 22:39:26 yes..this has nothing to do with oil prices ..just fun facts

561 2018-04-26 22:38:27 I'm old enough to remember when Assad was a good guy according to our government. An optometrist educated in our country a secularist, and a reformer. Strange what a little oil pipeline can do to change someones reputation.
562 2018-04-26 22:38:15 Alfie just landed on a bad governmental  actuarial square.

563 2018-04-26 22:37:57 How many mercenaries and terrorist are #Israel, #CIA, M16 paying to slaughter innocent people, how about  the 200+ NUKES pointed against #Europe and #America? blood for oil addicted warmongering Zionist  imperialist #Barbarians.
564 2018-04-26 22:37:52 With the rising price of oil, what affect will it have on the grain markets. Short and long term.
565 2018-04-26 22:37:51 I use Coconut oil & black Jamaica castor oil
566 2018-04-26 22:37:49 The UPS guy checked my oil for me and that pretty much sums up my love life right now 
567 2018-04-26 22:37:48 When dad tells mom “well I got a couple young engineers I’ll start setting her up with”  I swear, I can’t get away from the oil field 
568 2018-04-26 22:37:39 What the hell are you talking about. Suzuki has been trying to shut coal & oil since he was fired by UBC.
569 2018-04-26 22:37:34 GDP per capita is lower in Finland but the government brings in that sweet oil money which greatly helps with socialist policies. Since the oil rigs were invested in by the Finnish government, they get to reap a good portion of the reward, which in turn goes back into Finland.

577 2018-04-26 22:36:14 I think the “fruit” label is far too kind. 

They’re only good for oil.
578 2018-04-26 22:36:06 I do grassfed butter or ghee and coconut oil in coffee every morning!

588 2018-04-26 22:34:21 This is because pols in BOTH parties are bribed by bigspecial interests (health ins co’s, big Rx, big oil, Wall Street, etc) via campaign contributions so once elected, the politician represents their bigdonors at OUR expense.

Pls start voting for Green Party/Ind candidates.
589 2018-04-26 22:34:13 David I know the problem with my team under scrutiny but sometimes when you look af oil money with states who suppress women - just simple Wolves fan! Look at Man City.
590 2018-04-26 22:34:04 Whenever someone promote some good oil mixed with essential oil to put on skin...

for ur skin sake pls dont put anything contain essential oil on ur skin...just bcoz it calm ur mind doesnt mean its good to put on ur face.
591 2018-04-26 22:33:56 You are supposed to protect tax payers. You are obviously in the pocket of top shelf oil and gas. Resign.
592 2018-04-26 22:33:48 Oil refinery explosion in the spring just as they are switching from “winter gas to summer gas”. Hmmmmmm
593 2018-04-26 22:33:35 It's more about the idea of a convenient source of fat for keto--it's not like a broth you would make at home. I guess 'meat drink' doesn't sound as good as bone broth. BTW you should try coconut oil in coffee, tastes pretty good and coconut oil is life.
594 2018-04-26 22:33:33 How many terrorist and mercenaries are #Israel, #CIA, #M16 paying the slaughter innocent people to further the Zionist imperialist blood for oil domination in the ME?
595 2018-04-26 22:33:29 Yes, very likely. The environmental opposition is opposed to all oil production as their position is to leave it in the ground. It's an extreme view for the near future but they are fervent in their goals.
596 2018-04-26 22:33:12 That doesn’t mean that people ain’t gonna sell snake oil and make money off the smartest guys in the NFL.  Too many variables in a properly designed database, too many unknowns unless you have every coach feeding input into database when reviewing film.
597 2018-04-26 22:32:53 Save the earth, stop drilling for oil.

610 2018-04-26 22:29:24 I am making cauliflower fried rice this week! You grate it with a cheese grater and then saute it in some oil and add fried rice ingredients like onions, tamari, sesame oil. I like egg fried rice with zucchini, yum.
611 2018-04-26 22:29:22 We should totally take over the middle East and kick them out. They have sunshine and oil and they still fucked it up.we could make a great new civilisation there and build a bridge to Cyprus. We could drive to AyaNapa
612 2018-04-26 22:29:18 yes they dislike Alberta's policies they are also hate oil companies. They equate oil, conservatives and Alberta. The whole climate change phenomenon comes from a politics. Al Gore and others liberals took up the cause because it hit conservatives. Its politics.
613 2018-04-26 22:28:53 Re-reading the Harry Potters & trying not to get olive oil on their hallowed pages 
614 2018-04-26 22:28:41 Wow, Mercedes is a greasy dealership.  If you don't want your vehicle serviced at their dealerships for $1000/servicing(oil change) they have physically programmed their vehicles to not start after a certain period of time. How is this legal?
615 2018-04-26 22:28:25 Tires changed and balanced

Almost ready to head to SA for the weekend 
616 2018-04-26 22:28:24 To be fair, the oil industry did buy out the entire Bush Admin, which played a big role in this pricing surge. Not entirely luck, corruption also helped.
617 2018-04-26 22:28:15 Sorry SCC, that wasn't a dig or concern over your vehicles, I am sure that your fleet is absolutely fine, I was more in reference to the First Buses that operate around here. Only last week, I witnessed one of their vehicles driving along with what looked like oil spilling out.
618 2018-04-26 22:28:08 同期の皆々様はお金の使い方がすごく荒いんですけど、そっちのほうが普通なんですか？今月カードの支払い20万とか言ってて爆笑してしまったんだけど
619 2018-04-26 22:27:50 We just use rapeseed oil.
Possibly the most politically incorrect of all the oils.
620 2018-04-26 22:27:35 Coconut oil. Witch hazel on a face pad; Works wonders you’d be surprised how much grime comes off your face after that shit.
621 2018-04-26 22:27:33 and CBD oil - will help. Had it too , not anymore
622 2018-04-26 22:27:33 “And He (God) will love thee & bless thee & multiply thee: He will also bless the fruit of thy womb & the fruit of thy land, &  thine oil, the increase of thy assets in the land which He promised.” Deut7:13
623 2018-04-26 22:27:32 We should dump some tacks and maybe some oil too then.
624 2018-04-26 22:27:24 Can't watch the Idaho fry commercial without thinking about the fact they might use palm oil, which you really shouldn't be eating.
625 2018-04-26 22:27:19 Science has shown behaviour of Alberta dilbit in water is same as lighter oil. Bonus extra: using it rather than Saudi oil advances women’s equality - or do you oppose that too?

631 2018-04-26 22:26:06 Govt is cleaning out on behalf and in collusion with oil marketers. Who’s receiving the subsidy payment? Govt is paying itself?
632 2018-04-26 22:25:42 You should get a car powered by fry oil so you can smell it all the time.  Or it would be the ultimate torture device I guess. 
633 2018-04-26 22:25:35 Can't beat it, although i am still trying to find the best oil to deep fry chips.

646 2018-04-26 22:24:29 There’s boys reading this wondering why there are four of us committed to our opposition to coconut oil  yes we are mad
647 2018-04-26 22:24:22 One student speaking out in support of increasing the distance between oil/gas activities and schools: “It’s not enough to have a place to study and really good teachers if we have to be in an unfavorable environment.” #HB1352 #StudentsOverProfits

654 2018-04-26 22:23:26 This is part of the approval and companies are currently reclaiming oil sands mining. And not all bitumen comes from mining only a percentage. And I will get the exact percentage currently and of all planned expansion tomorrow.

656 2018-04-26 22:23:18 So lemme get this right. You want to have oil travel by train instead of a pipeline? Yea that will end worse for you.

665 2018-04-26 22:22:33 Ok @TkeyahBennett I think my hair likes coconut oil now?!
It doesn’t absorb as well as Shea butter but it doesn’t sit on my hair like it used to.

673 2018-04-26 22:21:01 As americans not, sure.
But don't you think oil is a huge business anyway?
674 2018-04-26 22:21:01 LOL ofc I gave him 5 stars, we were talking about Islam actually (and also cannabis oil LOL). Thanks bro, I appreciate it!!
675 2018-04-26 22:20:57 I have never tried that. I haven't even had it in a while. I eat liverwurst pretty often but actual liver seems like it would be more nutritious. I have mostly just had it cooked traditionally with oil and onions.

680 2018-04-26 22:20:43 In case anyone cares, I am not close enough to see anything in the sky from the Superior oil refinery explosion, despite being relatively close to it.
681 2018-04-26 22:20:37 I think about this often. They are akin to oil. They need to diversify but they just keep fighting something they can’t win. What if there were incentives for Ag to diversify? Can we get them producing #cleanmeat?
682 2018-04-26 22:20:36 Very interesting. I have a Twitter friend who does contract accounting for the oil sands in Fort McMurray. Beautiful area and fascinating town and work. Look forward to the factual side. One of my majors was biology in undergrad. Thanks!
683 2018-04-26 22:20:30 As far as I understand, it won't just be bitumen, it will be every oil product suitable for export
684 2018-04-26 22:20:22 is there supposed to be more to that article? I feel like he just reposted what they said, then it ended before he made a point
685 2018-04-26 22:20:21 coconut oil and aloe
686 2018-04-26 22:20:20 Yes I am interested in the draft!
For 1 moment let's pray & hope for the best for the city of Superior, Wisconsin. Most if not all evacuated due to oil refinery fire.

689 2018-04-26 22:19:56 There will never be peace in the Middle East.  War with all Saudi oil companies and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is declared upon all the kings assets.
690 2018-04-26 22:19:35 And how do you propose we sell our oil and gas (NATURAL RESOURCE) seeing as how Ottawa killed Energy East which would let us refine and sell oil to the rest of Canada? Just to the US as a massive discount?
691 2018-04-26 22:19:35 Learning how to do an oil change and change spark plugs today it’s a good day
692 2018-04-26 22:19:18 my bike is making noises, so I stopped ridding it...It's not oil, I don't know what to do or how to fix it! help please! got it on January 2016, thanks @SpinningHQ
693 2018-04-26 22:19:01 Yeah, oil should be sold in euro so that the exchange rate doesn’t artificially prop up the dollar

697 2018-04-26 22:18:55 Lest you forget Okonjo Iweala told us the Jonathan govt didn't save kobo from the oil bumper sales,& there w as constant looting,Before he left symptom of bad governance were already showing which was why he was voted out. d economy died #wonder4ulworld
698 2018-04-26 22:18:50 Cool. Now tell us the real cost of climate change. And the real cost of oil sands production, including all those generous production subsidies.

You want to do an accounting of policy then let’s do a real bloody accounting. Not classic Sun half-assery by folks with no expertise.
699 2018-04-26 22:18:48 @danielricciardo When can we see you do some US'ian racing... maybe dirt track World of Outlaws?... maybe Lucas Oil Sprint cars (maybe racing vs. Tony Stewart)?
700 2018-04-26 22:18:34 Maybe enough is enough. Time to maximise profit/tax/royalties from the product rather than rip and ship it. We are going broke while oil production is at record levels. 

It isn't right.

704 2018-04-26 22:18:07 Im not anti oil. Just pointing out the future of farmng in future drought conditions.  Closed system. Water in, very little input required afterwards. Controlled lighting, chemicals. Lettuce 7 days.   20 day cucumbers. No need for a JD or my old Ford 7000 turbo.
705 2018-04-26 22:17:59 They've already been wrong.

What could possibly be the problem with letting the Italians try?
706 2018-04-26 22:17:54 I've chosen to spend this lovely evening at the oil change place. Please bring a beer. I'm going to be here forever.

714 2018-04-26 22:17:19 None of this is good news, regardless. Methane emissions from oil, ag, etc., or the top one, enteric fermentation (see my link on that) are all contributing to greenhouse gasses and global warming. 
715 2018-04-26 22:16:56 Go to discount tires on Shaw and willow. If you need conventional oil they’ll do it for $16 plus you get a full inspection of your car and they’re always honest and won’t give you any bullshit

722 2018-04-26 22:15:57 If there's going to be inflation in some ares because of that so be it, but let's be real it's going to be shortages of XBOXs or something not an oil crisis (which was a prime inflation driver in the 70s as everyone remembers). Any real inflation driver will be exogenous.

765 2018-04-26 22:11:30 Holy fuck, that made me laugh! I had a customer come in and tell me that they had a knocking coming from their engine. She never got an oil change and drove it for 70k. It looked like burnt hot fudge when we took it apart. Factory. Oil.
766 2018-04-26 22:11:21 Someone explain to me why we let the rich white men of the world dictate our energy resources decade after decade. Had we moved to renewable years ago, Superior wouldn't be on fire and my community's viaducts wouldn't have oil piped right above them. #GreenEnergy

793 2018-04-26 22:07:01 It isnt the heaviest or worst oil to refine and recover on the planet. And you have no idea of lax environmental standards and practices of overseas oilfields. In fact the most polluted oilfield in NA is in California not in Canada but you dont see any Hollywood actors there.
794 2018-04-26 22:07:00 But you are ok with oil companies treating us like a colony.

The reality is we import oil and lots of it until we stop using oil all together which is years if not decades away we will still need to consume it. Dont believe me? Just try and stop using

846 2018-04-26 22:01:49 Funny ain't it how there's always plenty of money for unnecessary wars and occupations, particularly if there is oil involved, and so very little money ever available for social programs that do good and help people?

849 2018-04-26 22:01:37 That would be suicidal at many points, Syria is not out of conflict, and the west retire just to come back stronger, don’t give them stupid opportunities to come back early, to finish what they have started. Israel is digging his own grave, no need to add oil on fire.

854 2018-04-26 22:00:52 Help me out Mr President, what I can not figure out is why is fuel prices going up and up and up. Come on Mr President those of us that are on a fixed retirement income, are SS doesn’t go up. I thought that we had more oil than the other countries.

863 2018-04-26 21:59:43 The Saudis needn’t concern themselves about crude oil production. Hell, they don’t even need to cheat like in the old days. All they have to do is export more refined products because deal excludes products. They would sell sand if they could. All about revenue. Good night!
864 2018-04-26 21:59:42 Not true
The fact is it's just a dirtier (thanks to toxic diluent) more energy intensive oil
That's just fact and what will really hurt the tar sands industry in the long run

878 2018-04-26 21:58:02 Why all of the bitumen is not upgraded and refined in Alberta. If it was, the existing pipelines would be adequate (dilbit contains up to 55% diluent) AND way more jobs and revenue would be created in Canada AND Canada wouldn't have to import oil.

906 2018-04-26 21:54:57 Retweeted Leah Beno (@LeahBenoFox9):

OSHA has opened an investigation into  the explosion and fire that occurred at the Husky Energy oil refinery in Superior.
907 2018-04-26 21:54:55 Just because you are unable to follow doesnt mean that I am being difficult to follow. You brought up vlimate change and my point is that Canada could reduce its footprint by using Canadian oil. There is two standards one for Canadian producers and a lax one for everywhere else.
908 2018-04-26 21:54:53 An oil refinery exploded and is on fire and there is black smoke which will damage lungs and the fire is to big to get put out so we all had to evacuate
909 2018-04-26 21:54:45 #NOSB discusses use of mineral oil for topical use and as a lubricant; no apparent concerns with current approved uses in #organic livestock
910 2018-04-26 21:54:37 I bet 99% of persons crying climate change, oil spills, use fossil fuels themselves. They stress the Earth's carrying capacity by having multiple kids. They use public services, provided by taxed corporations,some of which employ and provide the same fossil fuels they use!!
911 2018-04-26 21:54:37 You’re like a bad AI chat bot spewing oil industry propaganda.
912 2018-04-26 21:54:30 Put stuff on my face to get rid of my acne but it’s still oily, so now I have to sleep with all this oil everywhere and the smell is horrible 
913 2018-04-26 21:54:27 So, replacing the vinegar shot with hot sauce, because I'm bleeding out my butt... Apparently the acid in the vinegar is really bad if you have intestinal issues. Also test-shot the olive oil and couldn't get it down, so replacing it with spicy mustard.
914 2018-04-26 21:54:23 You are just so kind and thoughtful Penny. Thank you. Wisteria is so beautiful. I saw Magnolia S today, lilac just coming out, blossom and fields of rape seed oil.  Spring is so wonderful and full of joy

922 2018-04-26 21:52:44 Please keep this kind of thing going and show hands filling a vaporizer, dosing Cannabis oil, eating a cookie.  

Showing the many sides of Cannabis helps to normalize it.
923 2018-04-26 21:52:41 Totally agree that we need to fund renewables and accelerate the transition to a fossil-fuel-free economy. (AB is phasing out coal, and just bought a large amount of renewable energy.) Notley's argument is that during this transition, getting a better price for oil would help.
924 2018-04-26 21:52:39 Ironic though that fighting fire with fire is exactly how they do it. Backfiring, controlled burns. Oil rig fires are actually put out using dynamite to use up all the oxygen around the well-head. Possibly not the best analogy for your excellent point.
925 2018-04-26 21:52:27 I was thinking I just may have been overdoing it on the dosages. we got a spray + an oil dropper and I been taking both.

929 2018-04-26 21:51:52 Totally, makes sense to hold out. In the meantime if you change your mind it is great to support the good (and complex) work that RSPO is doing with segregated and identity preserved palm oil. So glad you are making palm issues a priority, either way you go!

932 2018-04-26 21:51:43 just get your preferred essential oil scent and add a few drops to the soap. i put it in a separate spray bottle for cleaning - add essential oil, water to dilute soap. i sometimes add multiple oils - lavender, peppermint and rosemary, for ex.
933 2018-04-26 21:51:29 I find it odd that BC thinks they should be able to limit how much oil moves across the border into the province, but they think Alberta shouldn't be able to limit how much oil leaves across that same border.
934 2018-04-26 21:51:25 Shut the oil off already!! BC people need to be knocking down Horgans door after paying $3.00 a liter to tell him he is being completely unreasonable. We need action now Rachel, no more threats.

949 2018-04-26 21:49:48 The oil companies get huge tax relief. Millions of pounds of investment, why would Westminster want to lose that. These oil bosses are tory donors. Oil is part of the national interest. MI5 are tasked with protecting it, independence is a threat to England's national interest.
950 2018-04-26 21:49:44 It's *funny* how so many oil folks speak to truth abt what the companies are doing, even decades ago...sad, too

968 2018-04-26 21:47:30 LOL I called my favorite CBD company and they remember me LOL. Pre-roll joints are good, but what gets me through every day is a CBD water soluble oil. I'll try to remember to put that link up once the website is good again.
969 2018-04-26 21:47:07 In Syria, the US has let the 'good guy' mask slip almost entirely off its face, revealing the oil thirsty predator hiding beneath. Despite Nikki and Heather's non stop lying, everyone sees the US for what it is: a bad actor on the world stage. Russia has much more integrity.

975 2018-04-26 21:46:41 Haha! We popped back for a beer (all the good airfields have a good bar) and they were about to run it! Then we spent 30 minutes cleaning the oil off...
976 2018-04-26 21:46:38 Can’t knock this piece of equipment. I have others that you can bash, but this old girl has cost me little over oil changes for 10yrs now. A true work horse. Keep radiator clean and she will go all day!!!
977 2018-04-26 21:46:29 How low will the #GOP go? This live-for-today & fuck-the-environment attitude cannot continue without serious consequences. When you can't breathe the air from fossil fuels when you can't eat food from the ocean because of oil spills and the cancer rates keep rising what's left?
978 2018-04-26 21:46:27 As the Trump swamp goes, Pompeo appears above average. And he was already CIA director. The oil guy didn't do much, good or bad, and was probably let go because he didn't kiss Trump's ass enough.
979 2018-04-26 21:46:24 OIL shuts up the hierarchy, the liberals and the cities
980 2018-04-26 21:46:23 Approximately 100% of Albertans, and 50% of British Columbian, disagree with you. Again, the oil sands have raised wages across Canada, especially but not only in Alberta.
981 2018-04-26 21:46:07 Getting my haircut and eyebrows done on Saturday, oil changed, washing my car on Sunday, packing on Sunday

984 2018-04-26 21:45:36 Please keep #SuperiorWI in your thoughts as they deal with the massive explosion and fire at their oil refinery.
985 2018-04-26 21:45:31 Check your Engine oil this morning.
986 2018-04-26 21:45:04 at my age a lil more than oil would be needed
987 2018-04-26 21:44:46 I have drowned my face in rose hip oil so if this doesn’t work I’m suing
988 2018-04-26 21:44:34 Thankfully, by the time I came around, there were cod liver oil capsules. 
989 2018-04-26 21:44:20 Yes it was a lovely exciting city but expensive as the oil boom was on when I went but things probably have changed now...get yourself there...oh it would be a darn sight quicker flying though #JustSaying
990 2018-04-26 21:44:06 Protip. If you put some coconut oil on kale it's much easier to throw it into trash can ;)
991 2018-04-26 21:44:05 Order in some oil.
992 2018-04-26 21:44:03 Don't forget Lucas Oil Late Models on NBCSN this Sunday at 5 PM from East Bay Raceway Park.  Thanks for watching.

994 2018-04-26 21:43:56 Just what exactly do you think happens to oil sands oil? It is refined where possible or upgraded to low sulfer oil then refined. Along with that there is sweet oil in Western Canada that can be refined in Eastern Canada without upgrading. You should really do some research.
995 2018-04-26 21:43:44 We don’t have any choice- wool isn’t that important anymore.
We xport Whisky, oil, Gas - salmon and water
996 2018-04-26 21:43:42 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
997 2018-04-26 21:43:42 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

1004 2018-04-26 21:43:13 Snake oil, anyone?
1005 2018-04-26 21:43:08 I want the US to have an honest foreign policy. No more being predators pretending to be freedom fighters. No more lies. No more false flags and hoaxes. No more phony wars to steal someone else's oil. An honest foreign policy that considers the entire world, not just the US.
1006 2018-04-26 21:43:06 Says a total flunky for Big Oil.
1007 2018-04-26 21:43:00 @LoveAustralis you need to label your products that contain common allergens more clearly. Today I opened a bottle of your primer, put on my face and within 30 seconds it was burning. Peanut oil? Now covered in a itchy rash. NEVER have I seen a primer contain peanut products.
1008 2018-04-26 21:42:46 That's a fair critique of the US system overall. We do subsidize oil a lot among other things. But for this specific instance is about personal expenditures.
1009 2018-04-26 21:42:28 やっぱりホモじゃないか！
1010 2018-04-26 21:42:26 Hahahaha English and Bemba can't mix, they are like water and oil

1013 2018-04-26 21:41:40 I went to heb for vegetable oil and came home with everything but that 
1014 2018-04-26 21:41:36 Mm putting a hint rose oil in my hair was an excellent choice

1016 2018-04-26 21:41:07 My great-grandfather was in the oil business...my grandmother said he complained (in the 1920s til he died 1958) that the oil companies were going to eventually screw over the public...
1017 2018-04-26 21:40:57 You may be the only person in the modern world who isn't aware of alternate energy sources. Why do we continue to use oil? It has nothing to do with needing petroleum. It's about choosing dirty sources over clean ones. For profit.

1019 2018-04-26 21:40:38 5 years ago total oil revenue as % of total revenue was 33%. 2017 it was 1.7%. This makes a substantial difference to our economy which is largely dependent on oil and gas right now whether we like it or not. - NGC Pres MarkLoquan #bocas2018
1020 2018-04-26 21:40:29 I’ve tried the coconut oil shampoo and honestly it sucked. I didn’t like how it left my hair lol. & okay I’ll try the other things!!
1021 2018-04-26 21:40:19 Ruining BC land so that a private american and private Chinese company in Alberta can profit exporting oil to China is not best interest of Canada as a whole, it's the worst thing for Canada and for BC.
1022 2018-04-26 21:40:14 ああ、これ？スポーツブラ。油の貯蔵庫が垂れちゃうからね。
1023 2018-04-26 21:40:13 CBD oil saved my sorry ass life
1024 2018-04-26 21:40:10 I am capitalism and the Arab Revolutions are dangerous because the region is now in a position to export both oil and revolution.
1025 2018-04-26 21:40:04 I bet it's that nasty Bakken oil.  Remember the bomb trains?
1026 2018-04-26 21:39:54 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other.
1027 2018-04-26 21:39:51 Yet we’re oil rich and our whisky is worth billions. Add in our salmon  etc we’re worth more than them
1028 2018-04-26 21:39:33 It is what it is and that's how it's gone be
Oil in my pen, burn it down low-key
And y'all know me
I hit hard like Apollo Creed
You ain't ever had a friend like me
1029 2018-04-26 21:39:30 No it doesn't. You are selling snake oil.
1030 2018-04-26 21:39:18 This has nothing to do with free speech. It’s all about keeping Albert oil in the ground.
1031 2018-04-26 21:38:51 Thanks to @Nojeffingway for making me try MCT oil in my espresso. Now I'm addicted. It's rad.
1032 2018-04-26 21:38:48 Lotion that doesn’t have a ton of mineral oil in it should help. Hempz the original is the best in my opinion when girls used to fry at my tanning salon 
1033 2018-04-26 21:38:44 Who reads that rag anymore?!
1034 2018-04-26 21:38:42 Kraft. Yanks. Messed up the recipe & replaced our sacred British Cadbury deliciousness with horrid palm oil & cheapened everything. Ruined. First creme eggs went all septic & now they are filling every orifice with “Oreos”. Whatever they are. Please become an MP & fix this.
1035 2018-04-26 21:38:38 Not at all surprising.
1036 2018-04-26 21:38:38 Wage pressure, fuel/oil pressure, rising input costs in general > margin crushing
1037 2018-04-26 21:38:37 After the conversion of the AB NDP into the NDPCs it's hard to believe any pol party is sticking up for the environment or the public interest. I'm curious when big oil will convert y'all in BC. Big oil owns us. @RachelNotley @jkenney @OilGasCanada @JustinTrudeau @AndrewScheer
1038 2018-04-26 21:38:36 I just read some poor lady’s story about one of her twin daughters being allergic to coconut oil. Apparently the gma didn’t believe it, put oil on the girl’s hair overnight. Poor kid had severe reaction, vomited, swollen and asphyxiated. No jail time.
1039 2018-04-26 21:38:29 If your invention is efficient and threatens oil, an actual bit of law will deem it "secret" and hide it away... Big oil at work in government... ttp://www.collective-evolution.com/2018/04/25/this-man-one-ups-tesla-by-inventing-an-electric-car-that-never-needs-charging/
1040 2018-04-26 21:38:15 When we look at today’s @EPA , we see @EPAScottPruitt setting forth a “back-to-basics agenda”; Refocusing the agency back to its core mission. Trying to focus an overreaching agency is a challenge, we applaud him for his actions in doing that.

1041 2018-04-26 21:38:06 Wow! Everybody really is better at oil painting than me. 
1042 2018-04-26 21:37:59 I did, it's oil slick colored!
1043 2018-04-26 21:37:57 Last night I dreamt my father threw hot cooking oil at me while in a discussion... woke up completely lost and terrified
1044 2018-04-26 21:37:54 OI I SAW YA FOKIN AD WITH THAT OIL CRAP
1045 2018-04-26 21:37:51 That seems like the right way round to me. Hope it is for you though. BBQ > Oil

1047 2018-04-26 21:37:46 Make salad dressing! Mix 3 parts flaxseed oil with 1 part rice vinegar and 1 part tomato paste. Add garlic and agave to taste.
1048 2018-04-26 21:37:43 I said everything there's to say anyway. The TBI makes me repeat but I'm settling a bit now. Dunno how. Krill oil and whatnot healing me perhaps? Am still a bit confused but I'll just go with it.
1049 2018-04-26 21:37:41 Leave it to kobe to download a “palm oil” app onto my phone for me to find because he’s concerned about the rainforest
1050 2018-04-26 21:37:40 Brown sugar and honey as a mask and also exfoliate with. Rose hip oil to moisture. Steam your face every week and ALWAYS rinse with cold water
1051 2018-04-26 21:37:23 840,000 + km of pipelines criss-cross the country, part of a larger oil and gas sector that employs between 100,000 and 200,000 Canadians. According to Natural Resources Canada, the sector earns the government an average of $19 billion in royalties, fees and taxes each year.
1052 2018-04-26 21:37:18 You need to have a solution for all of the things that come with getting rid of oil. I just don’t think it’s doable for the next 100 years at least.
1053 2018-04-26 21:37:10 Each time you use it! So once u pump out some foundation, add one drop of the oil
1054 2018-04-26 21:36:58 Honestly, I could easily be president of the I Hate Fiber Mascaras Club. However. Milk's new Kush mascara is actually lovely (if you get past the very gimmicky name). 

Anyway, the CBD oil makes your lashes feel real nice when you take it off. I'm very happy.
1055 2018-04-26 21:36:57 my Thursday PM: 3 hour ‘after school’ revision lecture, followed by putting oil in my hair and writing up dermatology notes. I suppose this is sort of burning the midnight oil, but also makes me a massive dork (+/- luscious locks)
1056 2018-04-26 21:36:46 It's a good point but we weren't talking about transporting oil to eastern Cdn markets
We were talking about new pipelines to accommodate tar sands expansion
1057 2018-04-26 21:36:44 I smell like tea tree oil and look like a shiny idiot from all the facial oils loool oh well, no one is seeing me right now 
1058 2018-04-26 21:36:32 They did a great job Rob.....Prevented a lot of oil from entering the water courses 
1059 2018-04-26 21:36:28 Olive oil actually works pretty good for a bunch of stuff.
1060 2018-04-26 21:36:07 And for cars to drop gallons of oil on it on 1st July #oilycarpet
1061 2018-04-26 21:36:06 Loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ!
1062 2018-04-26 21:36:04 I mean what do you replace oil with? Tesla batteries are powered by electricity that is generated by.... you get the point. Batteries for electric cars and shit are hazardous waste when the battery dies. So how do you dispose of that?
1063 2018-04-26 21:35:52 CBD Oil...I will try it. It’s a feeling of absolute inescapable Doomed fate/outcome.
1064 2018-04-26 21:35:51 Double wow! I just finished reading your interview with him and I feel like I can hear him saying "...*that* tomato right there, *that* olive oil, at *that* temperature." Love him.
1065 2018-04-26 21:35:49 Staff: "Did you draw that?"
Patient: "Yes of course. This is a beached whale, this is an oil barrel, this is a car driving off a cliff—he's going to die for sure—and this is the sun."
1066 2018-04-26 21:35:48 In Savannah bug spray at the pool is more important than tanning oil
1067 2018-04-26 21:35:42 why can't we say the same for the #swampmonster? the #swampmonster had a constituency in oil & gas industries? the #swampmonster is wackadoodlecrazy?
1068 2018-04-26 21:35:20 Nationalists are still clinging to the fact that for a few years last century Scotland's oil ensured Scotland was a net contributor to the UK. No problem with that. My problem is when they use that to support their fantasy eckonomic forecasts for an Independent Scotland
1069 2018-04-26 21:35:19 Yeah it's almost like every one of our public institutions is beholden to oil corporations it's great
1070 2018-04-26 21:35:17 Oh yeah if it says Aioli on the jar/bottle it's like OH DAMN did I just enter into truffle oil territory?!?

1075 2018-04-26 21:34:41 I agree we need this pipeline those that are against,then quit using natural gas as well as fuel for your vehicles and getting oil changes done and how do you people think most of the food you people buy gets to the store they dont have green houses out back
1076 2018-04-26 21:34:32 did the oil tanker abruptly stop    did the woman drive to fast who was injured did both happen
1077 2018-04-26 21:34:12 I retired from the oil rig this year. Here you go makeing fun of the job that makes more money that you and your parents combined? 
1078 2018-04-26 21:34:11 I grew up on Vancouver Island and I have family there. The BC issue about using Valdez as a proxy oil spill is valid. Pointing fingers elsewhere does not change that
1079 2018-04-26 21:34:01 Need to oil my joints again. I swear, sometimes I feel like the tin man from the wizard of oz =A=
1080 2018-04-26 21:34:00 Pompeo probably talked to him about an oil deal...
1081 2018-04-26 21:33:50 Mom: how do I check what kind of oil I need?

Mom: how do I open the hood?
Me: really...
1082 2018-04-26 21:33:49 Coconut oil has no smell
1083 2018-04-26 21:33:48 Not much. Salt and pepper. Sometime olive oil.

1089 2018-04-26 21:32:51 Started putting coconut oil on my face and my skin feel so lovely.
1090 2018-04-26 21:32:41 There have been peak oil predictions for decades, none of which have come true to date, but ya never know, eventually some nostradamus will get it right...

1093 2018-04-26 21:31:45 The rest of the world has watched the USA deliberately pick a fight with Russia, China, North Korea. What’s the subtext this time? Oil? Boost the arms industry? Sanctions to improve US trade? We’ve had you up to here.
1094 2018-04-26 21:31:29 Please stop. We don't need the oil. We cannot tolerate another catastrophe.
1095 2018-04-26 21:31:25 I think what I’m enjoying most about our romantic night in is all the leg hair in the massage oil.
1096 2018-04-26 21:31:25 I’ve been waiting over an hour just to get my oil changed what the fuck

1101 2018-04-26 21:30:55 Snake Oil is going to be freaking hilarious; can't wait to watch the VOD after work :)
1102 2018-04-26 21:30:47 What a mendacious claim. Oil companies receive no subsidies not available to generic industries.

You should try running on free markets instead of lies (that would preclude being a D, sadly).
1103 2018-04-26 21:30:46 Finally watched #JusticeLeague. As a DC fan I was pumped. And now...I don't know. What a wasted opportunity. Like...seriously...bringing in Joss Whedon to finish a Zach Snyder film is mixing really pretentious bottled water with flamboyant oil.
1104 2018-04-26 21:30:45 5) I watched her try every outlandish kind of snake oil "remedy" she could find. I watched her get tarot card readings and go to see psychics, natureopaths, homeopaths who all promised a cure. I watched this destroy her and severely damage her marriage.

1115 2018-04-26 21:29:31 I’m not sure yet, as I’ve only just now been able to use it consistently (before I started using Marula Oil, it was intensely drying). I’ll have to get back to you. :)
1116 2018-04-26 21:29:31 has to do with the amount of oil your skin produces. Oily people got baby faces.
1117 2018-04-26 21:29:28 For us to cut down position we would have to get rid of refineries, which means plastics, runners and oils. Pretty much our lives and everything we use run off of crude oil. We as a planet would have to change our lifestyle to really cut pollution down.

1120 2018-04-26 21:28:52 It’s the hardest decision to decide what oil I want to diffuse everyday
1121 2018-04-26 21:28:50 You’re going to lube up the toothbrush with massage oil and take Advil for the pain afterward?
1122 2018-04-26 21:28:42 In Britain we protect vulnerable families from exploitation by snake oil salesmen.
1123 2018-04-26 21:28:39 Not gonna say much more till I finish this book. One thing is certain, NNPC is well rotten. And you could feel the tension between NNPC and NOI's Finance Ministry on monetary remittance from oil sales. This is also why I never defend Deziani. Please grab this book. Enlightening.
1124 2018-04-26 21:28:38 I do yes ... it will be very hard to get back into the car market IMO. They are addicted to truck/suv profits. Oil prices are creaping back up, demand will shift and they won't be ready.
1125 2018-04-26 21:28:37 @animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
1126 2018-04-26 21:28:36 Gotcha Susan
1127 2018-04-26 21:28:06 In addition: note that higher oil prices (as long as below $125) actually has a positive net impact on world GDP growth from a higher savings rate in net producing countries such as Middle East which in turn creates reinvestment in the world. Fed did a study on that 10y ago
1128 2018-04-26 21:28:04 "Dr." Snake oil,
Homeopathy makes claims that are beyond ridiculous - even claiming the ability to violate the most basic rules of physics. Homeopathy is as fraudulent as astrology. I am calling you a fraud. Sue me. Please

1138 2018-04-26 21:26:40 Iranian and Saudi oil money competed for our large Muslim population. Buhari and Zal Zakky are just fighting proxy war on behalf of their pay masters.

1141 2018-04-26 21:25:37 @C_3C_3 MAJOR PROBLEM! We ARE oil independent, yet GLOBALISTS control WALL ST! Now HIGH GAS $$ so NOW WHAT!??
1142 2018-04-26 21:25:33 Indeed a tragedy to see Trudeau a self professed green person - fight tooth and nail for Big Oil and support Kinder Morgen pipeline that will destroy landscape huge increase in co2 emissions and pollute
1143 2018-04-26 21:25:29 Small refiner exemptions never reduced national #RFS volume - it shifted the obligation to the remaining law-abiding refiners. Can't wait 'til @EPAScottPruitt tells all those big oil cos they're making bail for his buddies' waivers and the PES bancruptcy! @API_News #ethanol
1144 2018-04-26 21:25:19 Hi Steve!
VERY timely that I came across your tweet... I SERIOUSLY NEED To Try CBD Oil for fibromyalgia & a load of other ailments!!  Two things right now~ I noticed a couple of editing issues in a few things I read (if any interest, I'll share)& What Carrier Oil Is Used? THX!
1145 2018-04-26 21:25:13 Gun powder, gun oil, burnt rubber, and high octane gas are the greatest smells on earth
1146 2018-04-26 21:25:01 Love the part you talk about Fresh and sleeping mask. You made me really want to try the UFO oil. Btw, you can try this Korean Brand Sulwhasoo overnight vitalizing mask. That's about the only sleeping mask I can put up with, because it feels more like moisturizer, no goopyness.
1147 2018-04-26 21:25:00 My hair is thorrrsty
Need to trim and let it soak in coconut oil Ong.
1148 2018-04-26 21:24:48 Hemp can replace every use of oil. #Facts
1149 2018-04-26 21:24:44 And ! EVs have very few parts to go wrong, so save money on servicing, no engine, fan belt, radiator, oil leaks, exhaust, clutch, and break wear is minimal due to regenerative breaking. So it’s Myth that EVs are expensive, many have saved money, including delivery vans actually

1157 2018-04-26 21:24:08 My bathroom smells like tea tree oil, candle and weed smoke 
1158 2018-04-26 21:24:07 Incorrect. If it's so invaluable, why does the USA continue to buy and refine it? Why did so many refineries upgrade their facilities to handle the heavy crude? Declining future prospects? Have you not heard that demand for oil continues to increase by 1 million barrels per year?
1159 2018-04-26 21:24:07 I LOVE it! No coconut oil and it moisturizes.
1160 2018-04-26 21:24:05 A low dollar to the Euro for instance supports Euro EU countries to have more purchasing power for oil, ie reduces their overall oil purchasing bill. That in turns supports demand from Euro EU countries. Same is true for other net importing country such as India, China,Japan, etc
1161 2018-04-26 21:23:52 I think my problem might also be skimping on oil. I never believe there needs to be as much oil involved as there actually does!
1162 2018-04-26 21:23:52 @Thunder106NJ  I am so sad! You called my name at 4:00 today and I was getting my oil changed. Boooo
1163 2018-04-26 21:23:48 My highlights can end up looking like straw at the ends if I don't look after them well. I use natural products like coconut oil and aloe for best results.
1164 2018-04-26 21:23:44 None of the dilbit will be used in Canada, so that 10% must be oil/fuel. Upgrade and refine in Alberta, then ship it by existing (or even doubled existing) pipelines all over Canada.

1168 2018-04-26 21:23:14 We can throw Canada in with that lot. Oil has been the cash cow for their whole political/economic lives,but it’s getting close to its cost/benefit. It’s an addiction like any other.They are afraid of imagining a future that’s already here. Weird to watch.
1169 2018-04-26 21:23:06 Very pleased also to see some practical instructions from the crowd on how one should oil one’s beard.

1172 2018-04-26 21:22:47 Dinesh you're about as relevant as an oil lamp. Don't try to be hip or trendy. Your douchiness fucks that right up.

1174 2018-04-26 21:22:39 Pretty far stretch, but that's what slip n fall lawyers do. Our society is failing fast, like peak oil, we will wake up one day and it is all over.

1191 2018-04-26 21:20:32 should i research eu ban on palm oil or kanye’s love for trump?
1192 2018-04-26 21:20:30 strictly speaking, even a gas-powered trimmer *could* be said to be solar-powered... it's just long-deferred solar power! (sunlight on prehistoric plants which get buried and turned into oil... etc)
1193 2018-04-26 21:20:26 Dont we have some unused oil or gas platforms we can use ?

1238 2018-04-26 21:14:27 Cruz is 100% correct. The way Feds manipulate the cost of gas with RIN's and taxes is just ridiculous. Americans don't realize that Big Government makes more money on a gallon of gas than Big Oil, yet Liberal Elites think that Big Oil is the problem.

1258 2018-04-26 21:12:01 It’s easy man the only thing is I had to buy some coconut oil for the office to make sure I’m getting enough fat during the day.
1259 2018-04-26 21:11:57 Is it the same bad news from coconut oil farming or is it just the palm oil?  (Dont coconuts come from@palms?) im. Little confused about what is ok to eat if you want to be careful for animals sake.

On the #RecyclingCrisis-
#Plastic is not cheap.
It's an abundant #oil by-product- commercialised to scatter waste from the refining process.
It is choking ecosystems&killing the planet.
Cost of recycling plastic must be incl' in the purchase price.
1261 2018-04-26 21:11:31 Y'all, someone for real took anointing oil from our Christian section and poured it all over one of our ouiji boards!!! Super Christian like to ruin $50 of product in a store  I'm ded.

1264 2018-04-26 21:11:07 What about CBD's or rick simpson oil?
I wish you and your wife the best
1265 2018-04-26 21:11:01 @KenjiSmith1 I’m currently getting my cars’ oil changed. They just made a fresh pot of coffee!
1266 2018-04-26 21:10:48 The ratio is obviously very elastic: We have seen a gold/oil ratio of 8 barrels per oz in 2008 and 44 barrels per oz in 2016. And this was with a fully functioning paper market. The ratio can go much higher when/if there ever is increasing physical demand in the west ever again.
1267 2018-04-26 21:10:36 No, I think the Ds should actually do some work instead of coming around and pretending they care about AAs every four years, then selling out their communities to Wall Street, Big Oil and the cops.
1268 2018-04-26 21:10:30 making a twitter account was a mistake
1269 2018-04-26 21:10:28 Im really to spend time with my baby but not for my 8:45 appointment for my oil change lol
1270 2018-04-26 21:10:27 Well there's no oil so it must be something to do with alcoholic beverages. 
1271 2018-04-26 21:10:20 The difference between @Toyota @Honda & @VW  if your car has a 150k (oil consumption) piston ring problem & it's a known (lawsuit) manufacturer defect Toyota and Honda, lawsuit or not will step up to the plate and protect their brand & help their customer. VW will say tough luck
1272 2018-04-26 21:10:20 When I got to Andrew's house today, he said, "Your forehead is all shiny. Were you working out or something?"

No, that's just oil from my greasy skin.
1273 2018-04-26 21:10:17 @oirdcomss Felix - evening. Let me introduce you to @iBRABO_com and @NicheIntel of the former. They use some superb techniques which we call upon to keep us safe in the Oil & Gas industry. They closely monitor terrorists. Go well. Hugh.
1274 2018-04-26 21:10:15 84115 here and I stand with Bears Ears and Grand Staircase. You are selling us out for your gas and oil palm greasers. @ShireenGhorbani will listen to local voices like mine, not just destructive extractive industry money.

1284 2018-04-26 21:09:24 OIL DIFF: 6.35 -> 6.3
1285 2018-04-26 21:09:17 I think UAE's belligrent demeanor towards somalia has less to do with recent gulf crisis, but more to do with security and economic interests of UAE that the federal government rejected. UAE has only 3 sources of income a)ports. b)tourism. c)oil.
1286 2018-04-26 21:09:02 Apparently this for only oil going out of the province, not coming in.....
1287 2018-04-26 21:08:59 Of course it is about money... this is a class struggle hiding behind the false veil of tribalism.  And you know where the manipulation is coming from? The 50 odd oil and gas multi national companies marooned in Nigeria draining the very soul of the land.
1288 2018-04-26 21:08:52 Why are gas prices partying like it’s 2008?

Cause oil prices still look pretty 2018 to me!!

1289 2018-04-26 21:08:36 So they still have palm products, whether they call it sustainable or not...

Thank you for looking into this. Coconut oil doesn't work quite as well for cooking as "butter," but I'd rather skip it altogether until a non-palm alternative is available. Really appreciate the help!

1295 2018-04-26 21:08:02 Might as well throw out all your food that is not grown within walking distance, oil is here to stay, and will be dependent on it for many generations to come, unless you have a better fuel, oh your shit, you could burn that, lol cause you are full of it

1303 2018-04-26 21:07:04 Oh I've heard of big oil going in and handing brown envelopes and giving Cadillacs to writers and all sorts of journalists, It needs to stop! That's why I'm suspect if anything that talks about oil.
1304 2018-04-26 21:06:57 Yawa don gas
1305 2018-04-26 21:06:43 Gotta swoop my baby by 6.. out here oil hunting
1306 2018-04-26 21:06:40 Oh and in my experience, most yard air systems are in the 37kW range, some of the bigger ones I’ve been at have a 75kW and are usually an inexpensive oil flooded rotary screw.
1307 2018-04-26 21:06:33 I'm just sleepy and I'm getting my oil changed and then a nail was found in my tire 
1308 2018-04-26 21:06:27 i heard if u rub oil on ur fingers before handling chiles it helps reduce th tingle!
1309 2018-04-26 21:06:19 Step 1 was to transport KRG oil to Ashkelon. The vessel then went empty to Libya and picked up oil there to transport to Israel via Greece.

1322 2018-04-26 21:04:06 better gas than coal or oil (which is also disturbingly up), but we need all three of those particular category trends to be down hard.
1323 2018-04-26 21:04:03 #pnpcbc If Alberta can pass a law restricting oil flow into BC then why can't BC do the same thing?
1324 2018-04-26 21:04:02 Also america is not an oil producing country (as opposed to a country that produces some amount of oil) so you shouldn't be mentioning it.

1338 2018-04-26 21:02:25 $Oil High possibility of oil making a pull back. IMHO I would not want to short the pullback. Would want to wait for the bounce. In the long run oil is headed up. No trading advice.
1339 2018-04-26 21:02:22 Whatever regular moisturizer you use, and then once it's absorbed a bit add an oil on top if it - argan is good, and you can get it at Goodness Me I think (or go to Sephora, but it's more expensive there). But skincare twitter might have a better answer than this!

1393 2018-04-26 20:55:46 fresh cut don’t matter if your hair dry as hell .. invest in some oil sirs
1394 2018-04-26 20:55:46 I was freaking out on the way to get my oil changed because there was a BEE IN MY FUCKING CAR and bless the guy that vacuumed it out when I got there 
1395 2018-04-26 20:55:45 Maybe if they invested that $1.60 in Oil Futures they wouldn't be poor. I swear all they want is a handout.
1396 2018-04-26 20:55:37 Quit using gasoline, diesel fuel, bunker oil, av gas, jetA, and jetB and you won’t need Oilsands oil
1397 2018-04-26 20:55:35 Dope! What’s the magic behind it? Still not understanding how I can make fried chicken with out oil
1398 2018-04-26 20:55:34 Na so we see am
1399 2018-04-26 20:55:29 No, it didn't! I've been using rosehip oil too. It took me about a month to really see a change.
1400 2018-04-26 20:55:29 there was an explosion at an oil refinery across the bridge from me and instead of going to be an amateur investigate, i drove straight home after my internship. So, adulthood, eh?
1401 2018-04-26 20:55:21 @realDonaldTrump what is going on with gas prices,taking away any monies that we may have gained from tax break the oil company is getting it

1407 2018-04-26 20:54:13 It's the very notion of an individual's capacity/financial record to be 'credit worthy' - whether via mortgage, loan, car finance, insurance (life, travel, car, etc), gas bill, oil bill, phone bill, etc) that's awful, sick, even. To make rent records part of that is v. worrying
1408 2018-04-26 20:54:03 Real question, if my college blows up from an oil fire, do i get my tuition back? #uws
1409 2018-04-26 20:53:46 @JohnDeere Bought a new z345r from Lowes. Delivered was 1/2 qt low on oil and within first 2 hours of mowing the right arm came loose up under the mower. Got the part from a dealer, but wasn’t covered under warranty………. #nothappy

1411 2018-04-26 20:53:21 Approx 175 Americans will die TODAY because of opioids Not one person will die from Hemp CBD oil. 
#FACT — feeling concerned
1412 2018-04-26 20:53:09 Remember the jobs lost in BC when no fewer than 4 refineries closed after oil companies found it cheaper to refine in AB in the 1990s?   When do we get those jobs back?  Or should we be content with a promise you send us gasoline once in a while as long as we’re ok w/oil spills
1413 2018-04-26 20:53:06 mix two spoons of olive oil with lots of honey put it onto your roots wrap with some plastic foil and wait like an hour and then wash ur hair it actually does wonders to hair growth
1414 2018-04-26 20:52:52 Looking to some random, yet strategic, self-pitching.

1415 2018-04-26 20:52:39 closing off #Afrin in 2015 would have quickened the demise of isis. all fits in with isis used to selling oil to turkey.

1417 2018-04-26 20:52:38 A10. I actually started out as an oil painter and would take photos so I could paint from them. After awhile, I realized my photos could stand on their own and so I switched. If you see, I edit with a lot of vibrancy like an oil painter #flipbizchat

1419 2018-04-26 20:52:21 Wow in Kuwait I pay half the amount that's crazy and even the oil prices are increasing weird....
1420 2018-04-26 20:52:12 That’s the best one to try. Olive oil is good too. You can buy it from the hair store. I use Shea butter for my hair and skin it works great
1421 2018-04-26 20:51:55 waiting to get an oil change & my battery is low-how much life will I get until I’m forced to go analog (read a magazine)? #livingontheedge

1438 2018-04-26 20:49:41 Not surprising.
The WWE is doing a Royal Rumble Pay-Per-View from Saudi Arabia tomorrow. Not one female wrestler was included in the show. They must be giving Vince McMahon a barrel of oil for going against the WWE's Women's Revolution stance they've been driving last few years.
1439 2018-04-26 20:49:40 when oil pipelines fund social welfare programs, that's socialism. in this context, meals on wheels and various christian charity programs in texas are actually peak socialism. the left is winning after all.

1441 2018-04-26 20:49:16 Oil, sure. But it's not oil, it's dilbit, and cannot be refined in BC. If bitumen is going to be upgraded and refined, it should be done in Alberta... but nobody wants to do that. Wonder why?
1442 2018-04-26 20:49:14 Why don't you throw your laptop away, get off your damn cell phone and give up your car.  Don't forget to give up your toothbrush use something else to brush that tooth you have.  None is available without oil you FOOL. If your still tweeting your still using oil products.

1446 2018-04-26 20:48:45 We prefer natural gas versus oil at the present time.

1457 2018-04-26 20:46:53 Whatever your views about BREXIT, the UK government has been woefully inadequate compared to the EU. I wonder if part of the problem is that we’ve run down the civil service and replaced it with bought in, non-specialist, peddlars of snake oil?

1459 2018-04-26 20:46:33 If they were shipping crude or refined products to BC with the extra capacity, there would be WAY much less opposition. Instead, they're intending to ship dilbit to the coast and then on ships. Please don't confuse oil with dilbit.

No, you were too busy sucking his dick, making sure your sweetheart arms and oil deals were still on.

Hypocritical scum.

1470 2018-04-26 20:44:57 We've had that jump(insecurity) since EU was made leaving out Norway (oil). You Americans had a good run for your oil, I'll give you that  Yes it might hurt, but we can do it, so can you - you are so much greater, and now you might be encouraged to also be greener 
1471 2018-04-26 20:44:56 Hopefully I won’t need to get any other work done on this car but oil changes for a minute...
1472 2018-04-26 20:44:50 On the UK radio announcers are forever saying " We throw away plastic detritus ". I burn plastics that do not produce much or any smoke.  PET plastic cannot be burned as it gives far too much soot. Can PET plastic be heated in an atmosphere of hydrogen to produce oil ?
1473 2018-04-26 20:44:49 Your man Pruitt is an unscrupulous criminal who puts the profit of big oil over the lives of people.
1474 2018-04-26 20:44:34 This is where the oil is headed. The industry loves to brag about its safety record. Their long accident record and its many fatalities shouldn't be ignored.
1475 2018-04-26 20:44:33 That's as bad as saying Russian oil is environmentally friendly and actually improves conditions for wildlife when it spills.
1476 2018-04-26 20:44:30 I filled L's Skell with oil

1478 2018-04-26 20:44:23 Agreed Ms. Susan. Time to shut down the flow of oil and money.
1479 2018-04-26 20:44:22 Hmmm...perhaps, @RepJoeBarton would like to swim in dirty water and live near a oil field and smell the crap it spews in the air. Let’s just throw all the trash in front of their McMansions.

1482 2018-04-26 20:44:16 The oil companies have nothing to do with that soot...those are illegal refineries which are littered all over the Delta processing stolen crude which are in my opinion run by politicians. The oil companies aren't saints but they are not this reckless and sloppy.

1512 2018-04-26 20:41:27 The image is of a type of solar technology CSP has only 5 GW deployed, so it is more expensive, like oil when first dug up ~1890. Solar PV is more widely deployed~300 GW and as a result is now 3 cents /kWh, cheaper than new coal,gas,nuke nrg.

1561 2018-04-26 20:35:40 Yep. We have gone from limited exploration & maintenance drilling because of low oil prices to NO drilling because of no transport availability.

100% the fault of @RachelNotley & @JustinTrudeau via their @NDP & @liberal_party decades of anti-oilsands anti-pipeline activism.
1562 2018-04-26 20:35:39 I agree Jim. It only heightens the volatility of oil pice. Wind and solar are a great long term hedge against this as the feed stock is free and abundant.

1667 2018-04-26 20:23:41 Every time I see a World First group complaining about something that benefits essentially EVERY other player, it sounds like an oil baron billionaire complaining that homeless people don't pay enough taxes.
1668 2018-04-26 20:23:33 Hey Young man you don't need all those Oil to prosper in Business
Mostly when they oil is sold at a higher Price

1680 2018-04-26 20:22:03 How the case should be over?
The case had come into being
not automatically but much
Oil had burned to come to a position by spending millions
of $ & the payment is continuing through interested
parties vehement support not
available for any national
interest at all.
1681 2018-04-26 20:21:49 Evil means when you choose to do something that you know will hurt other people and you do it anyway. People are evil. All people are selfish but there's a line in the sand.

Democrats can deliver both.

Truth is OIL, GAS & COAL want you to believe only they can employ people.

NOT TRUE!

Believe them and destroy your kids, grandkids or...

GET THE FACTS
1688 2018-04-26 20:21:18 In case you hadn't noticed, it didn't work . The royalty review was a dismal failure. They should have held off until the industry recovered.

So yes, I'm unhappy. Our finite resources are being squandered. Oil production is the highest it has ever been and we are broke
1689 2018-04-26 20:21:16  I would leave the room looking glossy,cos mumsy would finish my body with olive oil
1690 2018-04-26 20:21:08 And if we sold them more oil and gas they could further reduce their reliance on dirty coal
1691 2018-04-26 20:21:08 CBD oil is the truth 
1692 2018-04-26 20:21:05 Oil glut, prices need 2go up.

1694 2018-04-26 20:21:02 Isn’t this the same asshat who apologized to Exxon for the last gulf oil ecological disaster becuz it was somehow the ocean & the seagulls & all the other sea creatures’ fault for getting killed in that mess?
1695 2018-04-26 20:21:00 Oil is such a joy to watch, man.
1696 2018-04-26 20:20:45 Although Rudolph W. Giuliani, has know Mr. Robert Mueller that in no way should suggest that he has any sway on Mr. Robert Mueller.  Mr. Mueller is a purest, Giuliano is a wanta-be city slicker. Oil & Water. Go figure.
1697 2018-04-26 20:19:51 My oil is all over my face. Can I use it all over?
1698 2018-04-26 20:19:36 That is not dilbit. Equating a fuel or oil pipeline to a dilbit pipeline is dishonest or, in today's parlance, Conservative.

1702 2018-04-26 20:19:00 全ての料理はオイルなしに作れない…(作れるのもあるかも、え、あるのかなぁ)
1703 2018-04-26 20:18:55 you know oil from back home is good when it comes packaged in an old water/gazouz bottle
1704 2018-04-26 20:18:53 I guess I should stop procrastinating getting my car’s oil changed cause the light finally came on 
1705 2018-04-26 20:18:51 Omg omg omg I’m sitting here waiting for my oil change and they just started my car and my Bluetooth was still connected to my phone and THE most sexual song just came on in my car. I’m fucking mortified
1706 2018-04-26 20:18:47 Top Five Alternatives to shooting a Speedball:

5. Lie on a bed of nails scented w/ lavender oil

1712 2018-04-26 20:18:29 u would be lighting the oil on fire not the water 
1713 2018-04-26 20:18:23 Just because I started using MCT oil again doesn't mean I want to talk to you about Joe Rogan
1714 2018-04-26 20:18:20 As the reports say, not one drop of KM oil has been spilled in bc water since inception in 1953 which perfectly backs up near zero risk claim.  30% increase is 1.3 x 0 = 0 increase in risk.
1715 2018-04-26 20:18:13 I am thinking easy grow - little infestation, weather hardy.  You should try kale ‘chips’.  Just remember 300 defree oven for 20 minutes.  Flavour as you wish.  Just don’t over oil!
1716 2018-04-26 20:17:59 That’s just pancake mix with extra oil and there’s no meat in that! Thought you meant suet pudding
1717 2018-04-26 20:17:39 There was an explosion at the oil refinery across the bay in Superior WI. They’re evacuating a large portion of the city. Last I heard there’s 20 injured, one critical. If any of my followers are in the Duluth/Superior area, I hope you and your loved ones are all safe. 
1718 2018-04-26 20:17:36 If we're getting more of our own oil, the prices should be going down not up. Supply and demand says when supply is high prices decrease... This is the monopoly controlling the market.
1719 2018-04-26 20:17:30 The left does not seem to like playing by their own rules.

1724 2018-04-26 20:16:56 Mr President: OPEC is creating jobs for Americans in our oil producing states AND creating a fantastic opportunity for exporting crude oil(reducing the trade deficit). Their cartels’ moves are backfiring on them. If we tweet about it they’ll figure it out...sh

1730 2018-04-26 20:16:14 and Paris accord withdrawals are counter-productive, I'm with you on that. Remember a lot of Trump's platform was restoring jobs though, that includes coal/oil/auto. Not saying it's right or effective, but that's the plan. Arpaio is terrible, but left-leaning leaders have (4/)
1731 2018-04-26 20:16:12 Coconut oil >>>
1732 2018-04-26 20:16:11 Omfg this guy told me my oil change would be $75 and when I told him that was insane he said “have you ever gotten your oil changed by yourself before?”

1735 2018-04-26 20:15:44 Agree in principle but TIMING  leaves lot to be  desired- when AB  literally "on its knees" fighting unreasonable environmentalists getting oil to Mkt that benefits ALL CDNS  not just Albertans. Asking  to NOW forget Suzuki's opposition to AB oil sands is ridiculous. #ab #Suzuki
1736 2018-04-26 20:15:20 Well then close down your BC Oil and Gas Pipeline in northern Alberta. Fair’s fair.
1737 2018-04-26 20:15:14 I talk slick my words got baby oil on em
1738 2018-04-26 20:15:12 Dragons turn into oil when they’re dead for centuries.  So you bought a Mercedes right.
1739 2018-04-26 20:15:02 This is serious. Our company just had its contracts for workovers with one important client(the biggest heavy oil producer in Canada) put on hold in Lloydminster because they’re corked and they have no transport capacity to justify working over all those wells.
1740 2018-04-26 20:14:49 To whoever blew up the oil refinery, ya moms a hoe
1741 2018-04-26 20:14:37 Justin sending 10 billion in oil projects from Canada to sheethole gender slaving countries may be countered by platitudes and blather. But not in my opinion.
1742 2018-04-26 20:14:23 Yep. But now we have oil. Keep filling your car up with fuel. Much appreciated
1743 2018-04-26 20:14:21 It's possible if we incline the terms of our PSAs with international oil companies to more of infrastructural dev't beyond their CSR initiatives, this reduces the profit share directly handled by the government. It reduces the risk of misappropriation of profit share"profit oil"
1744 2018-04-26 20:14:20 Worse than genocide, he doesn't support the oil industry. The grand dragon Jason of the Ultra Christian Party wants him convicted of heresy and be put to death by stoning with TruckNutz.
1745 2018-04-26 20:14:11 Most styes wont even last that long tbh have used it my whole life too it disappears overnight most times even if I don’t use it.. placebo effect is there 2.

1752 2018-04-26 20:13:53 Where is the CBD oil?
1753 2018-04-26 20:13:52 You can use natural oils like coconut oil (my personal fav) or belly oil by hatch and I have one other one but I don’t remember the name of it  it’s in an orange tinted bottle
1754 2018-04-26 20:13:39 Isn't this the same guy that thought Obama should apologize to BP for the Gulf oil spill?
1755 2018-04-26 20:13:37 Awsome, the Oil on the other arm?

1762 2018-04-26 20:12:56 It seems that I likely don't get enough water out of them. Wasn't "pre-treating" them with a low bake or very thorough wringing. Also, likely too little oil/butter.
1763 2018-04-26 20:12:53 Uhh... This is, like, an oil field, right? Should we really be tossing explosives around?

1773 2018-04-26 20:11:49 Mike. Very disappointing you would stoop this low. People may be dead or dying and you take this moment to get in a punchline about Alberta oil sands. Your thoughts for the victims are completely disingenuous under such circumstances. Better to have not said anything at all.
1774 2018-04-26 20:11:43 Oil change time.
1775 2018-04-26 20:11:32 Our nation needs a lot less of your snake oil, you fraud.

1785 2018-04-26 20:10:07 Dark ages societies... why do we buy oil from them when we have Alberta and Newfoundland right in our own backyards? And an oil refinery to boot!?

1795 2018-04-26 20:08:50 He’s right. It’s not for classified information. It’s for corrupt personal deals with big players in the oil industry.
1796 2018-04-26 20:08:45 My first, last and only visit to a Waffle House smelled like weed, Luster’s Pink Oil, and bad decisions. Read in the news the next day there was a minor riot after I’d left. #ymmv

1799 2018-04-26 20:08:15 They don't want to report anything that goes against the U.K. govt narrative. They want badly that oil in Syria so this was an excuse, a pretext but the ruse has now been exposed. @BBCNews are just organs for the govt propaganda.

1810 2018-04-26 20:06:32 This is the govt for the oil industry, by the oil industry
1811 2018-04-26 20:06:27 its a mystery as 2 why. Russia has Oil  has power maybe its a macho trip#Putin
1812 2018-04-26 20:06:21 All that big oil money is going to be hard to spend when they can't breathe.

1815 2018-04-26 20:05:49 I think it's mostly referring to the ambush in the valley with the rolling rocks, etc. The fire was the strategy to kill the apostle and her Holy Guard, but didn't come to fruition even if the oil itself did affect the pegasi's ability to fly
1816 2018-04-26 20:05:46 no to be dramatic or anything but im talking facts,,, lavender oil is better than heaven
1817 2018-04-26 20:05:41 Did you know you can call me to order CBD oil!? 1-800-992-0991
1818 2018-04-26 20:05:34 GOOD ONE!!
1819 2018-04-26 20:05:14 Maybe it "clean" Crude Oil! According to that Ferengi Scott Pruitt
1820 2018-04-26 20:05:11 It takes an even greater cognitive dissonance to make claims that lack substance or proof. You're pointing a finger, but you aren't offering any examples. You're full of shit. You aren't even pushing snake oil John, you're pushing the empty bottle it came in.
1821 2018-04-26 20:04:59 I came to Walmart early today to get an oil change and the wait was 2 hours and I just now came back and absolutely no wait moral of the story don’t wake up early to do shit kids
1822 2018-04-26 20:04:50 Nope. I am not a comedian. I share truth. And debunk myths. Aerospace industry expect us to believe that jumbo jets carry tonnes of fuel.. In their wings. You couldn't make it up. Yet they do. Oil is mainly used in plastics. You know the same thing choking/killing our environment
1823 2018-04-26 20:04:50  Seriously I hadn’t but I’ve had 2 glasses now which was for stress, Now I can tackle cleaning the oven and floor again as the oil is a nightmare to clean up
1824 2018-04-26 20:04:48 I’m drinking a pint of sunflower oil whilst enjoying a cheeky bar of lard.
1825 2018-04-26 20:04:36 OIL DIFF: 6.33 -> 6.35
1826 2018-04-26 20:04:34 coconut oil is a nice alternative when browning meat, i browned my sliced dipped-in eggs-milk/flour chicken in a small cast iron skillet before switching to a grill-style pan, gave a particular taste and made the chicken unsticky #cooking
1827 2018-04-26 20:04:33 A último momento aparecieron dos interesados en operar Oil Combustibles. Una quedó en el camino. La otra es la petrolera holandesa Trafigura, que tiene la marca de combustibles Puma. Ahora el juez tendrá hasta 90 días en resolver el futuro @radio2rosario @De12a14 @elTresTV
1828 2018-04-26 20:04:27 But they’ve gotta make an example of him. Can’t have this sort of thing becoming normal.
1829 2018-04-26 20:04:26 There’s 2 types of people in the world, one guy that tries to get me to pay $70 for a synthetic oil change & the other that says “he’s a fucking liar” my car doesn’t require that oil, it should be $30. Almost got finessed out here
1830 2018-04-26 20:04:14 Reuters- No company made offers in Uruguay's first oil auction for offshore contracts in 7 years -source
1831 2018-04-26 20:04:13 Dogwood is funded by the Tides Foundation...you know, that soros (Hitler youth) guy's organization that wants to kill Canada's oil/gas industry.
1832 2018-04-26 20:04:10 It is not from smoking it is from fried oil
1833 2018-04-26 20:04:05 Tip from @LynetteCenee: a drop of olive oil on cuticles makes nails grow faster. #manicure
1834 2018-04-26 20:04:03 .Our local reporters are being complete idiots with the questions being asked of our Fire chief and mayor about the large oil refinery fire. 
Like: How long do you expect the fire to burn?
What is the orange thing poking out of the smoke?
Do you expect more injuries?
1835 2018-04-26 20:03:35 when oil was at $46 I made a video saying it would go to $70
and then we'd need to bomb Iran to get to $100.
in a perfect world, that should earn me a Bloomberg tour
instead of death threats.

oil guys don't have a good sense of humor.
1836 2018-04-26 20:03:32 Tea tree oil smells like shit
1837 2018-04-26 20:03:27 Being in the oil field and not having a beard is so degrading
1838 2018-04-26 20:03:09 If Joy is one of the greatest leaders the "resistance" has, well, lol. Good luck with that.
1839 2018-04-26 20:03:07 Ready to go home im tired of doing oil changes
1840 2018-04-26 20:03:01 too much. too much machine oil. please I just want natural rubber and then I'll be on my way
1841 2018-04-26 20:03:01 Oil down is the shizzz
1842 2018-04-26 20:02:47 As long as that Canola Oil girl ain’t on here I will listen
1843 2018-04-26 20:02:34 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.

1850 2018-04-26 20:01:13 Seriously doubt that, maybe an oil refinery
1851 2018-04-26 20:01:13 Must be beard oil or balm. It makes such a difference!

1853 2018-04-26 20:00:54 Do you see a pall of light-blue smoke as you pull away in your vehicle? This means that the engine is burning oil, and it could be due to leaky valve guides, bad rings, or even a cracked block. An overhaul for your vehicle may be in store, in this case.
1854 2018-04-26 20:00:52 If you spot a stain of palm oil on the white garment of the lion, they ask you to provide proof it is palm oil. When they see a stain on others without proof of it they shout thieve! thieve!!

1861 2018-04-26 20:00:04 Don't forget to let your attendees know to mention NYIOOC2018 in their social media posts! We can't wait to see which olive oil comes out on top! @nyoliveoil
1862 2018-04-26 20:00:01 One year ago, @realDonaldTrump signed executive orders to rollback protections on monuments. This is an attack on America's public lands and an obvious attempt to turn these lands over to oil and gas. I will fight to protect our access to public lands.
1863 2018-04-26 19:59:53 “Pogshit”, he beat your oil money team by himself kid, take a hike
1864 2018-04-26 19:59:51 Praying for everyone in Duluth and Superior. Another classic example of how much money is tied to the news and oil. Stay Woke. Educate yourself, and do what YOU feel is safe.
1865 2018-04-26 19:59:51 I live across from this refinery, take your I defend the oil that kills our communities somewhere else.
1866 2018-04-26 19:59:37 Yes, I know my truck is actually smoking. No it’s not going to explode... I think. It’s just an oil leak.

I should make a sign for my back window.
1867 2018-04-26 19:59:34 Turns out you only have to get talked into buying one engine flush before your husband will volunteer to take both cars in for all future oil changes. 

So that plan worked out easier than I thought it would.
1868 2018-04-26 19:59:27 With due respect: Vancouver is already a busy commercial port, and Ottawa is putting $1.5B into Ocean Protection Plan. Oil sands have pushed up wages across Canada, not just AB, and Ottawa has to consider interests of Canada as a whole. In the end, this is federal jurisdiction.

Italian beef too dry? BAM giardinara

Your cereal aint spicy enough? BAM giardinara 

Her butthole too tight? A lil mild giardinara oil will slide that lil puppy in smoother than the cha-cha slide
1871 2018-04-26 19:59:16 What about more mild claims such as to use the oil in sore muscles?
1872 2018-04-26 19:59:15 actually WOKE twitter is talking about how OPEC is going to have the USA bomb Iran to get to $100 a barrel of oil. The Kanye/Trump shit is the latest 'Distract the Public' story.
1873 2018-04-26 19:59:03 This guy is pathetic. He is the same guy who apologized to BP executives after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill that devastated the Louisiana coast. He apologized....to the EXECUTIVES.
1874 2018-04-26 19:58:51 Hmm I've not used coconut oil, but I've used probably 3-4 different types of aftercare and will always recommend Aquafor as my #1.
1875 2018-04-26 19:58:50 It’s not ok to gouge all of America, just to ship off oil to China, who is buying up all the world’s resources at an alarming rate. This leaves us with the lowest oil reserves in decades. Then they don’t even have to pay their share of taxes when it’s all done.

1880 2018-04-26 19:58:00 i’m getting an oil change on my own, i’m grown
1881 2018-04-26 19:57:53 Marvellous. And I didn't even have to anoint your feet with oil and wipe them with my hair, or whatever the modern equivalent is.
1882 2018-04-26 19:57:37 Primarily because OPEC agreed to cut oil output at their meeting in 2016 and as US oil exports have risen. Inventories of oil in the US are down ~100 million barrels, driving up oil prices and thus #gasprices
1883 2018-04-26 19:57:33 Seems to me that oil is even more politics than the Cuban specialists
1884 2018-04-26 19:57:26 And supply 401Ks to Americans, who's stock is included in Mutual funds and Pension plans for teachers, police, firefighters & many others

Oh those awful American businesses
PS: Flood of US oil on Europe is all that's keeping gas prices down..since Russia and OPEC cut Production

1891 2018-04-26 19:56:28 What kind of CBD oil should I get that I won't get popped for a dirty drug screen??  I tried another brand and failed a drug screen at my pain dr. It came up as canabinoid. It was helping my pain and anxiety. I want to try another brand but I'm afraid to buy anything.

1893 2018-04-26 19:56:14 @bathbodyworks my hands and knuckles dried out after using lab test 004 rose foaming hand soap. This happened with the olive oil line too
1894 2018-04-26 19:56:05 Papadopoulos was recruited to join Trump's foreign policy advisor team in early March 2016 by Sam Clovis. Trump identified Papadopoulos as one of his campaign's foreign policy advisors on March 21, 2016, and said: "He’s an energy and oil consultant, excellent guy".
1895 2018-04-26 19:55:44 It appears that his complicity to @realDonaldTrump's undignified, unethical, unqualified and possibly treasonous degradation of our nation has paid off for Pompeo's career goals. It also appears that his science denial is a win for big oil/coal/gas/chem's pollution of our planet.
1896 2018-04-26 19:55:31 Oil refinery two miles from my place exploded at 10 am
1897 2018-04-26 19:55:23 NATO members don't pay "dues".
US was well on it's way to oil independence prior to Trump.
Most will be paying MORE in tax in the coming years and where are these 60% that don't pay Fed tax??? Probably rich crooks like Trump.
1898 2018-04-26 19:55:06 Oh my... the PR ships stats and perks are insane with that double oil costs.

1907 2018-04-26 19:53:37 To be fair to the sportwagon, yes it leaks oil, yes it has developed clonks and rattles over the 30k+ miles I've had it so far, but yes, it generally runs like a swiss watch (admittedly one made by massey ferguson)

Hexed it now, you realise 
1908 2018-04-26 19:53:29 This looks like it’s at a Lucky Strike. I’m surprised they even oil their lanes.

1912 2018-04-26 19:53:13 They build their own pipeline, allow foreign tankers but don’t want Canadian oil to tide water. They are hurting all Canadians.
1913 2018-04-26 19:53:12 More margins in oil? They gotta pay those patronage checks.
1914 2018-04-26 19:53:05 No doubt he can check out his oil investments while he’s there. Dark day.

1919 2018-04-26 19:52:39 Hi, it is a luxurious face oil that visibly brightens, firms, and evens the look of skin tone and texture. You can use it alone or with a moisturizer, depending on your skin type.
1920 2018-04-26 19:52:19 anyway, only people i ever stan are the Teletubbies, tinky winky would never do any of this headass shit y’all faves do, all he does is dance, roll down a hill, eat pancakes and pudding and mind his business. your fave rapper can’t even oil his knees, disgusting.

This guy certainly didn't graduate from Columbia, that is for sure, probably didn't even graduate from 3rd grade writing class.  Canada should bar this ass from crossing border.
1925 2018-04-26 19:51:53 But if they are, it's the employees' fault. No need for OSHA regulations here in the oil bidness
1926 2018-04-26 19:51:38 Yes!! But if you straighten it it looks dirty the next day. Curls hide the oil 
1927 2018-04-26 19:51:34 well, i for one am careful with my carbon footprint, encouraging everyone around me.....I hope there are going to be higher taxes on oil, diesel, and old cars in general in the eu. like luxury level taxes, we have okay public transport anyway

1931 2018-04-26 19:51:07 I think oil pipelines are hideous scourges on the earth. That's why I enjoyed learning about the black snake prophecy and its link to DAPL. Watching Robert Redford's "The West", on the history of the railroad building, got me thinking about it again...  
1932 2018-04-26 19:51:01 They sure are. I've had them for years. It's going down really quickly though with my magic coconut oil being put on at least every 1/2 hour. Bloody things x

1938 2018-04-26 19:50:19 But so much oil...........
1939 2018-04-26 19:50:17 in my defense, when we were looking for rosehip oil, i told you we could get some of them but you said no 
1940 2018-04-26 19:50:10 Not all oils behave the same way when spilled into the marine environment. Learn more about the behaviours of oil in water in our latest blog post available now.

1943 2018-04-26 19:50:07 I... idk why I even ventured out into the twitter wilds.  Feel however you want about big oil companies etc, but using the fact that this explosion has happened “near Lake Superior” to make your point.... have you *seen* Lake Superior? >
1944 2018-04-26 19:50:06 If you're going to play that game then Scotland doesn't have a deficit, but UK does. Responsible govs invest all or some of their oil revenues in an oil fund to create a renewable income forever. UK spends its oil revenues thus doesn't have that asset nor its investment income.
1945 2018-04-26 19:50:04 We should know that the best way we can benefit from this oil is by making it an entirely local product. People should prioritise skilling themselves - Patrick Ruharuza #NTVOnTheSpot
1946 2018-04-26 19:50:01 Oil exporter, meaning we are selling off our oil reserves to China, resulting in higher prices for Americans at the pump. But oil execs are making $billions, so who cares. 
1947 2018-04-26 19:49:58 PRESS CONFERENCE UNDERWAY: Superior Mayor Jim Paine addressing the public on the latest in the oil refinery explosions and fire. 

AUTHORITIES: An asphalt spill is being determined as what is burning at this time

IN DEFENSIVE MODE: No firefighters being sent in
1948 2018-04-26 19:49:55 That would be second on my list ;)
1949 2018-04-26 19:49:44 大家至愛既杏核油 (Apricot Kernel Oil)終於返貨啦

桃核仁油含有較多的單一不飽和酸，它也含有一種叫做亞麻仁油酸的成分，能輕易地被肌膚吸收 ... #thecuring #Aromatherapy
1950 2018-04-26 19:49:42 Well, at the same time, we can make them say anything and everything.

And what was the reality of the Iraqi people at that time?

Good on the other hand that the oil wars of the Americans is ruined the country, yes, the question does not arise!
1951 2018-04-26 19:49:42 Why do we export oil and gas when we need it here?
1952 2018-04-26 19:49:41 Do not give them Biafra Jews and Christians in West Africa. From SLAVERY to GENOCIDE to continued GENOCIDE for oil. LIBERTY  AND FREEDOM.
1953 2018-04-26 19:49:27 "Normal Americans" don't spend their days colluding with oil, coal and chemical corporations to skirt laws and poison Americans. His phone booth is an attempt to do so secretly.
1954 2018-04-26 19:49:23 Oh and let’s look at the Middle East: dictator after dictator after tyrant after tyrant ! It’s amazing the greedy little oil barons hold the West to ransom over oil then piss their pants every time the West get a request from a state begging for our help - we should pull out
1955 2018-04-26 19:49:22 @realDonaldTrump Another super business plan: More oil drilling etc. Allow shipments of US oil overseas!
Crude Oil goes from $32 in Jan 17 to now $68 under your watch. Gas from $1.89 to $> 2.52. Oil companies get rich, Tax cut saving killed in two months under your Admin. SAD SAD
1956 2018-04-26 19:49:21 Make no mistake about it. Pruitt is the Koch Brothers inside man in the Administration.  It's no coincidence the EPA regs being thrown out help Big Energy (coal, oil, & gas).
1957 2018-04-26 19:49:15 水(ウォーター)とは仲が悪いです。
1958 2018-04-26 19:49:15 yet, you're sound as though you are willing to risk others' for you to enjoy your BB cap, sunny's and all the other benefits of life today. Everything you eat, wear, drive (or ride, yes.. bicycles) come to you by way of oil.
1959 2018-04-26 19:49:12 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
1960 2018-04-26 19:49:01 Oil companies own California government. Governor Brown has done nothing to find out why big oil has so many excuses for high prices, he just adds to the pain by increasing taxes. Leadership at its worst.
1961 2018-04-26 19:48:54 george. please don't give status to snake oil sales people like her.
1962 2018-04-26 19:48:53 that looks gooooood. my fave sundrieds are the Sicilian pachinos, packed in oil. love 'em.

1965 2018-04-26 19:48:37 these are pasting brushes? I was using them with oil paintss for making the circles on my abstracts, oh so long ago...
1966 2018-04-26 19:48:24 @drizzyposh25_  Edo people will even eat Bole with red oil and Salt
1967 2018-04-26 19:48:19 I gave up on Cadbury after craft took over and swapped the Coco butter for vegetable oil. Plus they shut keynsham after they promised they wouldn't. Bastards

1970 2018-04-26 19:47:44 So there won’t be a stream tonight. There is a 15 mile evacuation radius due to a fire and explosion at our oil refinery and I am going to my moms. Those of you in my area, be safe.

1972 2018-04-26 19:47:25 @realDonaldTrump You gave corporations and the rich huge #TAX cuts. You gave the rest of us miniscule cuts. Oil and gas price increases are sucking it all (+) up. #HOAX #LIES #EpicFail
1973 2018-04-26 19:47:25 @jodyvance Cruise ships don't carry bitumen. Refined oil and bitumen are two very different things.
1974 2018-04-26 19:47:20 Fire crews are working to stop a fire after an explosion at a Wisconsin oil refinery.. LIVE pics at 4 @wsbtv
1975 2018-04-26 19:47:15 I’m so close to finishing this art series. Oil paintings is definitely all about patience.
1976 2018-04-26 19:47:01 About to get my oil changed finally
1977 2018-04-26 19:47:00 Just wait, any products trucked or railed from BC will cost you more too, soon. We all pay for the US oil companies gouging us. Our tourism will likely be affected too 
1978 2018-04-26 19:46:49 #NTVOntheSpot @ntvuganda Oil wells have been changing hands between dealers who have made billions in profit. It seems by the time that oil gets out of the ground, it will already be too expensive. Ugandans will never enjoy cheap oil.
1979 2018-04-26 19:46:46 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1980 2018-04-26 19:46:23 Try tea tree oil , dilute it w which hazel
1981 2018-04-26 19:46:13 Infused olive oil or butter with some Carbonara is my favorite!
1982 2018-04-26 19:45:59 I haven’t put any oil in my beard all week and you can tell. Been itching like hell. Must rectify this immediately.
1983 2018-04-26 19:45:46 Lying in bed, listening to the Doors. I really should oil the hinges...
1984 2018-04-26 19:45:39 Oil will not be our solution. Agriculture, Fintech, transportation, telecoms is where we need to be. A sleeping giant like URL to date is not showing us what their strategic plan is in terms of winning on the market yet the opportunities are immense.
1985 2018-04-26 19:45:11 These are the uneducated youths Buhari is talking about. They are waiting to collect oil money from Mr president
1986 2018-04-26 19:45:06 Electric buses are hurting the oil industry via @technology
1987 2018-04-26 19:45:05 Stupid Q- It’s an oil refinery, right?
1988 2018-04-26 19:45:00 Liberals want to keep Canadian oil in the ground, but funding protests and adding another review easier than just telling K-M to get lost.
1989 2018-04-26 19:44:48 What about how badly we missed Matt Hendricks and not eberle pouliot sekera (half season) and pitlick
1990 2018-04-26 19:44:43 lush has a bath oil called polyamorous 
nice
1991 2018-04-26 19:44:33 *gets addicted to CBD oil
1992 2018-04-26 19:44:31 No doubt in my mind. Big Oil has big big moneyand big power. Too much for Alberta to handle especially when the Feds are in there too.
1993 2018-04-26 19:44:26 @Shalemag.com magazine, check it out all you oil people out there.
1994 2018-04-26 19:44:24 Oil refinery explosion in Superior, Cosby is a convicted drug-rapist, & POTUS infers obstruction of justice again on tv. #thewordisfallingapart
1995 2018-04-26 19:44:04 justie dislikes Canada in general, but vehemently despises Alberta & its oil resources -- why should those Western hillbillies get rich? He is a traitor.
1996 2018-04-26 19:44:03 I didn’t like how negative he was on Tesla. Paradigm shifts are never pretty. Even if Tesla fails, it forced the industry into a new direction and will influence oil stocks forever
1997 2018-04-26 19:43:59 A Friday RNS would go down rather nicely with oil at these levels. #char #casp #aaog
1998 2018-04-26 19:43:55 Avocado , egg , coconut oil , braid your hair when it’s wet 
1999 2018-04-26 19:43:54 I think the freakiest thing about them is that they secrete some sort of oil on their skin. Normal cats, the fur absorbs it.
2000 2018-04-26 19:43:46 #NTVOnTheSpot the database ended, off line and will open again in September, that recruits companies to supply oil industry, why?
2001 2018-04-26 19:43:43 How about we talk about the #NOKO negotiations happening as we speak...? Or how about the raising oil prices that nobody can afford...? 
Go ahead. Keep the #sheeple uninformed.

2003 2018-04-26 19:43:37 Why do City fans think that we have genuine rivalry? 

Utd, yes. The Ev, yes. Maybe even Chelsea these days. But not City. It’s never been City. 

Have we ever given a flying shite? Is it because they think it makes them less oil money and more history?

Baffles me.
2004 2018-04-26 19:43:36 Carful. The beard oil makes it slippery
2005 2018-04-26 19:43:33 Pretty sure oil is making a loss at the moment. Certainly did last year. Why would they be so keen to keep it now? Strange argument.
2006 2018-04-26 19:43:32 can you get your oil changed while it’s raining 
2007 2018-04-26 19:43:05 What?  It is uk oil tax spent in the uk.  No damage.  I stand by the spend per head comment.

2009 2018-04-26 19:42:53 That routine performed butt naked, covered in nothing but oil would be amazing to watch. 
2010 2018-04-26 19:42:49 NPDC set the ball rolling by rejecting mana whenua input declaring its all white council will always act in the best interest of its residents...ppfft. That was code for 'in the interest of pakeha' Oil co's promised same bs too.
2011 2018-04-26 19:42:49 Thanks Debbie. I’ve been taking CBD And THC oil since January. The Dr told me that if I take it it will help me more. It does help with fibro pain.
2012 2018-04-26 19:42:35 The whole organization is a sham.
2013 2018-04-26 19:42:24 Gotta say, my favourite take away from this year's Oilers season is the notion that @ctalbot33 needs someone to push him. To want a better backup is fine but there is nothing to suggest Talbot's year had anything to do w/ not having someone "nudge" him along. So silly.

Obama cared about people. Barton/Pruitt/Trump care about their wallets and oil co's.

2020 2018-04-26 19:41:10 This unfortunately is much harder to do than it seems,so many products have palm oil in them,most frequently as "may contain one or more of the following ingredients____palm oil, canola oil..."

2038 2018-04-26 19:39:09 That's a good thought. I'm thinking a long short strategy might work for a small percentage of a portfolio along with some energy/oil. still keeping much cash.

2044 2018-04-26 19:38:22 How am I preparing for the infinity war premiere you ask? 2 facemasks, drinking a gallon of green tea, burning sage, bathing in witch hazel, tea tree and coconut oil, blocking Kanye on twitter, eating half a mango, going through 3 bottles of Mario Badescu rose water spray

2046 2018-04-26 19:37:47 @Pommawolf CBD oil is legal everywhere. Just research a reputable brand before you buy. 
What's not legal in many places is THC which is the psychoactive component of cannabis.

2048 2018-04-26 19:37:36 i think that was just damage from the oil? which i mean. way better than setting it on fire i guess

2052 2018-04-26 19:36:47 You created division amongst the Libyan ppl, USA bought and marketed the killing of Gadaffi through media, u played an important role and sponsored ppl on the ground kill Gadaffi becoz of oil

2057 2018-04-26 19:36:24 No matter what your decision for her is the oil is beneficial. If you decide on treatment, it will ease her pain and nausea and give her back an appetite which is vital. Or if you choose against any treatment it will give her the same benefits which will give her quality of life.
2058 2018-04-26 19:36:20 Someeeeee dummy put oil in the ducking oven 
2059 2018-04-26 19:36:13 The oil sands issue ultimately is about money, and while that is important for us right now, the earth is more important both for us now and beyond our personal existence. Yes, he should be honoured.

2065 2018-04-26 19:35:22 CBD oil & derived cannabis products...have uses in human medicine & I wish the veterinary world. But, Im not allowed to give advice on it
2066 2018-04-26 19:35:15 I can do one better. NAFTA destroyed Michigan, sending living wages overseas. You can thank Al Gore for that little sales pitch. But hey! Feel free to buy whatever snake oil he’s selling today. Let’s say yes to carbon taxes to fund a new world order!
2067 2018-04-26 19:35:00 My husband used to work on oil rigs now does safety at different chemical plants & refineries throughout country & it’s not easy work & it’s dangerous at times but I doubt it’s 20 casualties maybe injuries but not casualties   
2068 2018-04-26 19:34:58 How much suffering do you allow deluded parents to inflict on him by dragging him around the world pursuing empty promises when the travel will inflict suffering and, possibly death, on him if the snake oil doesn't?

2074 2018-04-26 19:34:26 Our thoughts and prayers go out to everyone involved in the oil refinery explosion this morning in Superior, Wisconsin.
2075 2018-04-26 19:34:13 @realDonaldTrump why do I keep paying more and more for gas?! Since global warming doesn’t  and we can continue to drive our cars shouldn’t there be plenty of oil and shouldn’t prices go down?! Can’t you get us a better deal?
2076 2018-04-26 19:34:11 Why doesn’t Captain Birdseye make cod liver oil supplements. What does he do with all the cod livers when he’s making fish fingers?
2077 2018-04-26 19:34:10 Barako coffee ba kamo  sardines nlng na may omega oil gud for the heart. 
2078 2018-04-26 19:34:10 I've always been under the impression that keloids need to be removed with surgery and they grow ridiculously fast whereas hypertrophic scars are small and can be treated with sea salt or tea trea oil or stuff like that and reside on their own
2079 2018-04-26 19:34:00 In Delhi NCR we have Pollution Check points on every Oil Station..Try to have them in U.P too..I would not say on every Oil Pumps but some of them in a District
2080 2018-04-26 19:33:42 Ronnie is almost as good of an artist with oil on canvas as he is as a musician, his painting of Elvis that hangs in Graceland is unreal
2081 2018-04-26 19:33:41 Do you not think the infrastructure was abandoned for a reason?

Like I live in a tiny little city and we have two (2) primary industries, agriculture and oil and gas. O&G has been tits up locally for a couple years; people are struggling, leaving town.
2082 2018-04-26 19:33:40 Guys stop buying toothpaste and stop buying deodorant just get you some baking soda and peppermint oil all you need fam i wouldnt tell you wrong family 
2083 2018-04-26 19:33:38 Excellent point! 

A lime kiln needs Oil or Gas
2084 2018-04-26 19:33:34 @EnergyPhilFlynn for @SkyNewsAust  - See Phil on Sky Business News in Australia at 3:30 pm CST to talk oil! | #energy #trading #markets #futures
2085 2018-04-26 19:33:33 Whenever someone mentions the petro-yuan and the oil-for-gold trade, I’d be sceptical.
2086 2018-04-26 19:33:29 thankful for good skin . Personally do not have a special skin routine but two words... jojoba oil .
2087 2018-04-26 19:33:25 They get @BeavertownBeer neck oil on tap I’ll pack in Jurgen’s Tricky Reds
2088 2018-04-26 19:33:22 Does anyone else feel like they’ve got their life together after they get an oil change?? Feeling like an adult today.
2089 2018-04-26 19:33:07 I’m a Wounded Warrior Alumni and the actions of @realDonaldTrump and @VP are disrespectful and UnPatriotic. They don’t support us, they are all talk for votes.  Snake oil salesmen.  They attack our Gold Star  families, our POW’s and now our Purple Heart medal veterans 
2090 2018-04-26 19:33:04 So how do you think we should be moving oil that is already being transported by truck and train ?
2091 2018-04-26 19:33:02 #Graze's fries are made from fresh cut Kennebec potatoes, twice-fried Belgian-style in Non-GMO rice bran oil and seasoned with kosher salt. #Tucson
2092 2018-04-26 19:32:57 Thanks, Liz. It was eye-opening for me to spend time out there and hear what folks are dealing with...especially with oil ratcheting up as fast as it is right now
2093 2018-04-26 19:32:47 Oil Refinery in town had an explosion. This is my current emotional state.
2094 2018-04-26 19:32:37 Really? Do you have any idea how much stuff you use that has some type of crude oil in it? Even that phone or keyboard your typing on does. It’s in everything or used to make everything from your clothes to your houses
2095 2018-04-26 19:32:35 I wonder if #Pruitt realizes is an oil refinery just exploded in Superior?? So we have a perfect example of what happens when you deregulate. It turns out the whole town is going to need to be evacuated

2102 2018-04-26 19:31:21 Now I'm sad Feel better!!!!! I must get you some Thieves essential oil. Sent hubby to the office today with an essential oil spray because everyone is coughing, sneezing... (and you're always pretty!)
2103 2018-04-26 19:31:11 A focus to landlock Cdn oil/gas? This organization gets funding from Tides. How long has it been this governments agenda to destroy Alberta & end oilsands dev’t & prod? Why so opposed to CRA’s investigation of charitable organization practices?
Further details @FairQuestions

2104 2018-04-26 19:31:06 eh, Scotland only gets some revenue from Oil..it is WM who run it..thus the reason no Oil fund was set up! :D Good God are you really so uneducated?

2110 2018-04-26 19:30:26 STEM CHEM STUDENTS!! Bath bombs are turning into oil in the water! Be cautious about bathing in oil!
2111 2018-04-26 19:30:26 Every dollar & cent these puppets earned in deceit, for blood, for oil, for trees, for war, & for slavery etc, is just a tremendous debt on their souls.

2119 2018-04-26 19:29:22 oil stains the worst
2120 2018-04-26 19:29:19 @RepDeSaulnier dont ask #calpers to divest from automakers. My #calpers pension is under funded by $7 billion, we need high performance not just "feel good" investments. I want tobacco, oil, and automaker stocks in my portfolio- if it's not illegal #calpers needs to be invested.
2121 2018-04-26 19:29:19 Ah, big oil, the 4th branch of government.
2122 2018-04-26 19:29:10 Who's laughing now eh? LoL.......
Electric buses are hurting the oil industry via @technology
2123 2018-04-26 19:29:05 Yalniz fiyati burda fazlaymis niye oyle bilmiyorum. (30tl falan) Ben eve yakin organik marketten siparis veriyorum. Dermoeczanem’den aliyorum arada da. Tea tree oil’in (antioksidan ozellikli) Cool Mint olani favorim. Serinlik hissi de veriyor. (Mavi renk olan)
2124 2018-04-26 19:28:57 . John, as you know, w/o the #RFS, there would continue to be an OIL mandate in this country. The RFS helps bring about consumer CHOICE.
2125 2018-04-26 19:28:46 Got into an argument with an Albertan who claimed without the oil sands money, Canada would go into economic depression. Lulz, I just ended walking away, can’t reason with delusional.
2126 2018-04-26 19:28:44 ONCE!

Just ONCE I would LOVE to take my car in and not have a four figure repair needed for it instead of the $60 oil change. Or for them to not screw up a simple oil change. FFS. I can't wait to get rid of this car.
2127 2018-04-26 19:28:31 No lube fam. She gotta use some coconut oil at this point
2128 2018-04-26 19:28:27 Michigan politicians celebrate Earth Day by company shutting down leaking oil line in Great Lakes .... That’s some real progress
2129 2018-04-26 19:28:15 They've made that mistake in the past and then oil went up above $100 and a recession hit...
2130 2018-04-26 19:28:04 Other comment I often hear is that Alberta gets the benefit, BC gets the risk. In fact the oil sands push up wages across the country (Stephen Gordon, Kevin Milligan); AB gets a lot, but not all of it. And Ottawa has to consider the interests of Canada as a whole.
2131 2018-04-26 19:27:54 I like Stihll & Huskvarna 2 & don’t 4get the extra oil, a rope, backup chain & safety equipment [i.e.] goggles, gloves, jeans, boots, headgear & a first aid kit! Safety never hurts! 
2132 2018-04-26 19:27:49 Well I finally got my oil changed and it was only 20 thousand miles over this time lol
2133 2018-04-26 19:27:48 BAN PALM OIL!!!
2134 2018-04-26 19:27:45 DO YOU KNOW WHAT MACRON N TRUDEAU JAMMAL TAHIR CASTRO ARE DOIN RITE NOW IN MALI?
THEY ARE STEALING THOSE POOR  PEOPLE'S GAS  GOLD OIL N LAND TO DESTROY THE SOUTH AFRICAN ECONOMY FOR THEIR UK BOSSES TO TEACH AFRICA A LESSON FOR TRYING TO STAND UP FOR THEMSELVES
2135 2018-04-26 19:27:40 We import oil on tankers that burn somewhere between 35 to over 50k litres per hour of the lowest grade highest sulfur bunker fuel. Why does no one consider this while refusing to transport Canadian oil yo Eastern Canadian markets?
2136 2018-04-26 19:27:34 @RandPaul is all for the corruption of Pruitt. He likes the deregulation. An oil refinery just blew up in my town. Yeah for deregulation.
2137 2018-04-26 19:27:32 we're doing another oil animation boys hgjfkd
2138 2018-04-26 19:27:11 72 Sq Mile evacuation in Wisconsin oil refinery fire.. that's maga right?

appears no attempts to control the fire (wow what a place for remote fire fighting equipment, but you know gop) so whole oil refinery is going up.
2139 2018-04-26 19:27:11 Would the Alaska Permanent Fund count? While funded by oil, It’s run by the government
2140 2018-04-26 19:27:06 Dude I’m pretty over this conversation at this point this wasn’t meant as an attack nor do I need this on such a gorgeous day! So I’m headed outside before trump sells it all to the oil companies!
2141 2018-04-26 19:26:52 State Inspections, tune-up, oil change, struts&shocks, electrical problem and much more...
2142 2018-04-26 19:26:37 They will not ever admit they were conned by a snake oil salesmen.

2148 2018-04-26 19:25:54 I only have some perfume oil. Rubbed some on my wrists and under my nose but it still doesn't cover the smell.
2149 2018-04-26 19:25:48 So, I work in Superior Wisconsin, and they’re evacuating maw-fuckas cuz of the oil refinery fire that broke out.

Best case scenario is mere evacuation and nothing else starts to burn up. 

Worst case scenario is that I’m caught in the blast radius.

2160 2018-04-26 19:23:53 They weren't watching very well when Maurice Strong, corrupt oil tycoon and profiteer, was their "Mr. Environmental" everything. What are they actually watching?
2161 2018-04-26 19:23:50 They don’t have a big gold supply but  they have natural resources like metals, oil, lumber, water. Canada will be fine.

2173 2018-04-26 19:22:24 Tfw an oil change turns into a muffler replacement 
2174 2018-04-26 19:22:23 Unfortunately it is taxes that make gas so expensive. Federal and state governments make more per gallon than the oil companies.
2175 2018-04-26 19:22:17 Evacuation orders, schools closing as oil refinery fire threatens Superior, Wisconsin residents.

2188 2018-04-26 19:20:33 No oil in my pen, no weed, I fucking HATE this shit. I hate relying on pills man. I hate medications  this shit is killing me. It’s only a matter of time before I try to kill myself again.
2189 2018-04-26 19:20:01 Feb 19, 2018 - The World's Top Oil Producers of 2017. United States. The United States is the top oil-producing country in the world, with an average of 14.86 million b/d, which accounts for 15.3% of the world's production.  Like everything else we pay more than we should be.
2190 2018-04-26 19:20:01 Lolz...

Who decides fiscal terms? Oil Production target, oil price..and Oil revenue of the Federation?

are you suggesting that NEC decides how Oil money will be shared at National and Sub-national level

Oga.. Look closely at the constitution

The Joke is huge
2191 2018-04-26 19:20:00 Hmu if you want to try olive oil straight from the mountains of Greece. You know it’s the best because it’s stores in miscellaneous recycled bottles.
2192 2018-04-26 19:19:59 I’m sure the oil industry will use this to screw California’s gas prices.
2193 2018-04-26 19:19:54 Oil prices globally are dependent upon each discrete supplier around the world. Disruption or increase of supply anywhere effects the price everywhere.
2194 2018-04-26 19:19:46 have you ever started to use mouthwash, and walked around the house to do something, then 30 minutes later you’re on the train and can’t recall spitting it out so you assume that you must have swallowed it and get mad at yourself? yeah me neither
2195 2018-04-26 19:19:42 Spanish omelette - whatever you have (onions , capsicum, ham/bacon, garlic, tomatoes), fry gently in oil, add lots of beaten eggs, stir gently until starting to catch, add grated cheese  then put into a hot oven for abt 15 mins to set. I use a large metal casserole dish to cook.
2196 2018-04-26 19:19:42 Say's the List MSP who doesn't realise 62% of Scotland's voters said no to Brexit. Even the Tory Snake Oil Dealings with Cambridge Analytica couldn't get them a majority in Scotland.

2208 2018-04-26 19:18:26 Does it heat up an element or something or do they literally just burn the oil to produce heat?
2209 2018-04-26 19:18:24 Do you mean how much he likes the Saudis and the other Middle Eastern  oil states? He and his family were very unashamed about sucking up to them, I'll give you that.

2212 2018-04-26 19:18:04 Can I dm for the Shea butter, the castor oil and your number??

I want to export my heart to you! 
2213 2018-04-26 19:18:02 Tea tree oil has to be THE STRONGEST scent on earth 
2214 2018-04-26 19:17:58 A SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT will create an oil fund...again. Indy Scotland does not belong to SNP!!!
2215 2018-04-26 19:17:40 The witch hunt for Bill Cosby is over! Can't wait to see who gets there hand on that land he got with all that untouched oil in the ground. Those woman got used once again for another's agenda.
2216 2018-04-26 19:17:09 Fish oil, b complex, calcium (with magnesium) and primrose oil. I take those daily and everyone around me has a cold and I’m completely fine 
2217 2018-04-26 19:17:04 Sinead has conjunctivitus. She has recently put in oil based eye drops to help.

Sinead, out of the blue, during a film, with one hand covering her right eye: "I CAN SEE RAINBOWS."
2218 2018-04-26 19:17:00 Its all fun and games slathering coconut oil on your body until you can’t find your subway card and it’s stuck to the back of your leg
2219 2018-04-26 19:16:54 At present, for the #US the only country in the #MiddleEast that really matters is #Israel. The noise about #Iran is just because of Israel. The US can live without the oil produced in the region. And there is nothing else that might justify, a costly military or economic effort.
2220 2018-04-26 19:16:50 Our VETERANS deserve THE BEST SERVICE, the BEST LEADER! They were sent to fight for oil! For RICH interests!
2221 2018-04-26 19:16:50 You need a hydrating facemask with some detox water and coconut oil
2222 2018-04-26 19:16:33 Hope all Turns out well for her and all the worry turns to new better days. Good diet exercise and attitude Always increases the odds.  A lil medicinal Cannabis oil won't hurt either. 
2223 2018-04-26 19:16:33 完全に寝るタイミング逃したなぁ
2224 2018-04-26 19:16:31 Haha I think the oil companies call that profit! :)
2225 2018-04-26 19:16:22 This guy overreacted and if he hit the woman,he was in the wrong,but not to get hot oil thrown at him,unless he had a weapon,which was not the case.Customer should have just walked out as I would,if I had poor service.
2226 2018-04-26 19:16:21 Suggested cannabis oil to a cx at work today, they asked how to use it and I mentioned it comes with a syringe. They then ask “do you shoot it up” ... like no u take it orally but good guess
2227 2018-04-26 19:16:16 I just put oil in my car and I feel masculine but also concerned that I may have done it wrong
2228 2018-04-26 19:16:03 Oil: The stable fuel of the future....

2230 2018-04-26 19:15:52 Nice to see the oil companies are still greedy as ever and price gouging.
2231 2018-04-26 19:15:45 No worries.  They don't have it.
2232 2018-04-26 19:15:36 Suing big oil is like suing farmers and folks that drive local produce to your supermarket for climate impact. Suing the local electric company that keeps you from freezing or frying. What the... Let the folks in Boulder Colorado go one winter without heat generated by oil.
2233 2018-04-26 19:15:29 So basically I need all of these. I still have a tiny vial of oil that came with my Magician candle from House Of Intuition but. But. But.
2234 2018-04-26 19:15:21 Rejects the one leaks the same as well Oil engineers a terre noir like moving towards the deep assignment Climate conflict
2235 2018-04-26 19:15:19 It's such a nice day today. The weather is getting warmer, no class today, the only cloud in the sky is the smoke from a burning oil refinery, Infinity War tonight. What a lovely Thursday
2236 2018-04-26 19:15:18 “My kids arm is totally dislocated should I take him to be seen...?” -Just rub coconut oil on it. 

“Violet is turning violet what should I do?” 
-just give her some essential oils

“My kid shit a LEGO what should I do?” 
-Try not feeding your kid Legos Karen. Stick with Kale.
2237 2018-04-26 19:15:12 He who says there’s no smoke without fire have obviously never cooked with palm oil before.
2238 2018-04-26 19:14:54 O m g.   Thank God I'm no longer British.
2239 2018-04-26 19:14:48 It's not NHS. It's Alder Hey Hospital. Other UK doctors have criticized the hospital's decision as "medical tyranny" that "brings our whole profession in disrepute."
2240 2018-04-26 19:14:45 And THEN, you'll ruin your coastline, local jobs, fisheries, canneries & environment by allowing oil rigs wherever this unregulated mess takes us?
2241 2018-04-26 19:14:30 Bruh all I can smell is peppermint essential oil and I’m gonna die
2242 2018-04-26 19:14:28 Hot oil massage
2243 2018-04-26 19:14:26 It's been  another awesome time in the presence of God make it a date with us on Sunday in the Oil of Favour Service by 9a.m. God bless you.

2244 2018-04-26 19:14:25 yeah it's the old houses. huge oil tanks in the basements.
2245 2018-04-26 19:14:17 Pure and Faultless: "In January, I had the pleasure of visiting Rahab’s Corner with a Young Living Essential Oil group. While there, we met Moreen and the girls of Rahab’s Corner and were charmed by the joyful, uplifting, program they performed for us..."
2246 2018-04-26 19:14:13 1 final between me and successfully completing P1.  Prayer warriors  gather your oil and books.. I need it all for tomorrow
2247 2018-04-26 19:14:07 YouTube how to change your oil lol!
2248 2018-04-26 19:14:01 Folatil oil dlm jahe sudah sejak dulu tbukti bisa mngatasi problem penyumbatan hidung dan sesak nafas
2249 2018-04-26 19:14:00 Coconut oil.
2250 2018-04-26 19:13:59 #OPEC is preparing to ratchet oil prices up to $100/barrel, commodity based countries like #Zambia better be wary and get ready for fuel-cost-push- inflation. The premium on lack of quick and timely innovation was never more expensive than now.
2251 2018-04-26 19:13:57 1.8Trillion that's English debt 10billion is debt due to being part if the UK,  if Scotland was independent and the act of union 1797 didn't happen and Scotland discovered the oil  among all the other resources, would Scotland be in debt or would we be in profit(debt free)
2252 2018-04-26 19:13:55 Worst. oil. ever.
2253 2018-04-26 19:13:35 Depends on maintenance. Over 250,000kms with good maintenance. We were lucky to get a very low mileage. I take it for battery Pack calibration every 10,000kms and minor (oil change and filter) service every 15,000kms
2254 2018-04-26 19:13:31 Mechanic: how may  I service YOU? *winks 
Me: *smirk, gives clipboard & keys* the lubricant in the engine has become contaminated by the burning of the refined petroleum and requires replacement.*winks, heads to door* Mechanic looks at Coworker: change the oil, lol #extra #diva
2255 2018-04-26 19:13:30 Oh boy. There’s a long list. But the biggest was probably the oil spill on the gulf of mexico and then the explosion from them mining off the gulf that they even made a movie based off of called Deepwater Horizon
2256 2018-04-26 19:13:16 Nothing insane about it. Global demand sets the price, and the US/Saudis are their main competitor. As long as we insist on driving our fuel hogs and having fancy toys, oil companies will look for ways to get it cheaper. And they did
2257 2018-04-26 19:12:51 Sure the Tide Water Foundation....why not?  They are as anti oil sands zealots as Mr Suzuki.
2258 2018-04-26 19:12:15 there’s this huge fire/explosion at an oil refinery near me and if the whole thing explodes a 25 mile radius will have too evacuate and i’m like 5 miles away
2259 2018-04-26 19:12:11 How do you guarantee that outcome?  Other than by being British,  I mean?
2260 2018-04-26 19:11:57 @DoseofNikki Happens to the best of us! Did you get the oil changed yet?
2261 2018-04-26 19:11:53 I need an oil change
A new motor
Some car body work done
A paint job
A new inside
I just need a new vehicle.. a truck.. yea .. that’s it
2262 2018-04-26 19:11:51 Gas/oil/tarsands are not the future.
2263 2018-04-26 19:11:47 Interesting how "oil fields" is in quotes?
2264 2018-04-26 19:11:42 KM won't die if diluted bitumen isn't allowed.  Pipelines will also be needed for processed oil or for bitumen balls.  I don't know why politicians and the oil industry is married to diluting the goop instead of doing something else with it.
2265 2018-04-26 19:11:36 I got this new hair oil that smells like red KoolAid
2266 2018-04-26 19:11:36 I don’t see why the question can’t be answered without beating around the bush. The bitter fact is that we can’t have oil out of the ground by 2020. Bse the president indicated we should have oil flowing by 2020 every Gov official sings the same wrong song
2267 2018-04-26 19:11:33 In India, there is a tendency to see relationships as black & white - you are either allies with China or at war with them. This is dangerous. It's absolutely possible to have fundamental differences over global governance while sharing data on rivers or cooperating on oil trade.
2268 2018-04-26 19:11:30 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2269 2018-04-26 19:11:13 I got my hair done, getting a oil change, and tomorrow a dentist appointment. I may be jobless but I am THRIVING
2270 2018-04-26 19:11:13 It wasn't NHS. It was the doctors at Alder Hey Hospital. Other UK doctors have criticized Alder Hey Hospital's decision as "medical tyranny" that "brings our whole profession in disrepute."
2271 2018-04-26 19:10:47 constructive suggestion? poach some whole cloves of garlic in olive oil. you get all the tasty garlicky goodness at any time you can want.
2272 2018-04-26 19:10:43 chicken oil :( bbq :( dumplings :(
2273 2018-04-26 19:10:43 Just strengthening shampoos and coconut oil your hormones are returning to normal so your hair is exiting it’s rest stay and it’s losing all of the old and sprouting new hair. I’m in the same boat girl it’s just a waiting game just take care of yourself
2274 2018-04-26 19:10:31 I will used Grilled Marinated Artichokes from Trader Joe’s when I make this recipe. I will drain the oil fromthe hearts. Also, the oil is great to use as a salad dressing or drizzle over pasta.
2275 2018-04-26 19:10:22 anyway I'm always down to learn more recipes if you find any ones you like! Lately I really enjoy veggies, cauliflower rice, and lots of avocado oil & seasoning
2276 2018-04-26 19:10:21 ＢＢの変装は本当にすごいぜ！やっぱベテランだけあるよなー！
2277 2018-04-26 19:10:18 So good! Growing up I only ever ate it pickled but now I'm all over the fresh stuff. Peeled beetroot roasted with oil, salt and pepper MWAH!!
2278 2018-04-26 19:10:09 Looks a bit more civilised than when I was there for oil field dev.
Had to use an analogue mobile phone brick. It didn't work, except as a useful knuckle duster.
2279 2018-04-26 19:10:09 You're a lesbian, you claim to hate men, but you say you love Jesus Christ.
...
My sister , you need a gallon of anointing oil for your deliverance.
2280 2018-04-26 19:10:08 How's that when #bitcoin:

i. has no intrinsic value,
ii. is "unregulated",

&  

#bolivar;
 i. is backed with #Orinoco oil reserves et. al,
ii. backed with people's faith (and still the official fiat)?

How come 1btc was worth seven billion bolívares?
2281 2018-04-26 19:10:08 Our oil is not yet hedged. Good news
2282 2018-04-26 19:10:07 これはおっぱいじゃなくて油の貯蔵庫だよ。最悪の事態の時はここから、ね。
2283 2018-04-26 19:10:06 Engineering safety systems for offshore oil/gas industry with appropriate materials and design is a challenge and it pays well. Young folks, stop studying dance theory and become a STEM major. 
Good schools @UFWertheim @UCF @LSUEngineering @GeorgiaTech
@TexasTech and many more..
2284 2018-04-26 19:09:42 @BraveTart So if I wanted to take an existing and delicious recipe for Olive Oil Cake from @TestKitchen and make it chocolate, is it just a matter of subbing some of the flour for cocoa powder?
2285 2018-04-26 19:09:40 Perhaps I have to update my resume to "Government franchise lawyer" post- oil states.
2286 2018-04-26 19:09:32 engine rod/bearing gone, 4.5 qtz low on oil how was my car even driving to begin with
2287 2018-04-26 19:09:25 @TonySeskus Could you follow-up your Alberta Alienation Article with some facts about how transfer payments to/from Albert work, how much Alberta has paid or received in the last 50 years (highlighting when Oil/Alberta economy was up & down... Good to compare hype vs. reality!
2288 2018-04-26 19:09:24 @realDonaldTrump   I finally figured you and Doit Pruitt out, you had your trustees get hold of Proctor and Gamble stock because of “Dawn”.  Given the new oil and gas drilling and new pipe line approvals you figured there would demand increase because of spills.
2289 2018-04-26 19:08:53 Yea Dirty Chai is awesome in the Perfumed Dry Oil, Silk Body Cream and of course Java Cleanser
2290 2018-04-26 19:08:47 I've owned a Delica and should never have sold it. Ran it off veg oil, towed the race car and we slept in at the tracks. Even pulled a huge tree out of the garden with it.
2291 2018-04-26 19:08:41 IS IT HOT IN HERE OR IS IT JUST YOU GRRRRLLLL DAMN

IVE ALSO BEEN BOILED IN HOT OIL SO I'M REALLY HOT TOO
2292 2018-04-26 19:08:39 Yea Dirty Chai is awesome in the Perfumed Dry Oil, Silk Bldy Cream and of course Java Cleanser
2293 2018-04-26 19:08:29 Also I hate sitting at the car lot waiting on my oil change. Every sales person that walks by wants me to trade my car in and tells me the same thing over and over  #leavemealone
2294 2018-04-26 19:08:18 Oil prices end higher on bets the U.S. will reimpose sanctions on Iran
2295 2018-04-26 19:08:14 More than oil; costs of goods sold continue to increase across the board, healthcare costs, housing, etc.  All passed on to consumer.  Wage gains also cause inflation via businesses passing expense on to the consumer.
2296 2018-04-26 19:08:11 Peggy is dying a slow and painful death  poor car didn't even have any oil in it 
2297 2018-04-26 19:08:10 Would Oil be a better investment at current prices?
2298 2018-04-26 19:08:06 That suck. I enjoy their oil alot. It smells great. When I cut my hair super low I use it on my scalp as well instead of traditional pomade/gel. Gonna need to hit up the shop this weekend to see if I can get the beard balm and shampoo
2299 2018-04-26 19:08:01 Are you just a day girl now then? I miss your late night oil shows 
2300 2018-04-26 19:07:49 Get yourself hip, THC oil> rolling backwoods
2301 2018-04-26 19:07:38 His family is making tons of money from Gas & oil industry since his sister sits on the @SempraEnergy board, it is all about money honey!!

2302 2018-04-26 19:07:18 Well Oil companies can start electric company and buy into this before they are strapped for cash.. Quite a shame they haven't thought about this!
2303 2018-04-26 19:07:17 its the lack of good old fashioned smoke, also used to mask the smell of chip fryer oil, decent British boys beer has gone as well
2304 2018-04-26 19:07:11 Pleased to say I've missed them all. I presume they were all the same. What snake oil is he selling?
2305 2018-04-26 19:07:04 Babe Ruth- FTI vs. Taylor Oil, time change to 8:00 pm start at Cameron Field.

-Using both pure oils can help grow your eyebrows and even darken them slightly if you have blonde eyebrows!

2312 2018-04-26 19:06:12 S/o @ModestoSubaru for the free oil change today. What should I spend that extra $100 I now have on??
2313 2018-04-26 19:06:04 aching joints i need sum oil
2314 2018-04-26 19:06:02 coconut oil
2315 2018-04-26 19:05:50 The fuel price was lower when crude oil cost 120USD.Strange that.
2316 2018-04-26 19:05:45 Feb 19, 2018 - The World's Top Oil Producers of 2017. United States. The United States is the top oil-producing country in the world, with an average of 14.86 million b/d, which accounts for 15.3% of the world's production. Zero reasons why we pay this much.
2317 2018-04-26 19:05:44 The last of the OPEC countries to be destroyed and conquered by the West. Gotta get that oil mulah.
2318 2018-04-26 19:05:08 why didn’t anyone tell me grapeseed oil smells so good??? i feel like a gummy candy rn this is incredible
2319 2018-04-26 19:04:57 If the American people really understood how they were being taken for fools by the Zionist Rothschild banking system and the international oil corporations and the CIA etc. they would overthrow this government in a heartbeat. It will eventually happen.
2320 2018-04-26 19:04:56 Loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ! null
2321 2018-04-26 19:04:53 While Scott Pruitt was on his first class flight to meet w the oil lobbyists.
2322 2018-04-26 19:04:49 If you think Houston is “Democrat” that’s pretty hilarious. Look at the voting map, most everyone with money and a job is conservative and in a suburb. Houston is blue and is nearly 100% supported by oil and gas conservatives.. the more you know 
2323 2018-04-26 19:04:33 vape oil. Please I must see
2324 2018-04-26 19:04:32 Don't forget fat.
Eat it. You only want to cut out the junk food fat but the healthy fat is essential. Eat foods like nuts, olive oil, avocados, salmon (and other fatty fish) to name a few.

2326 2018-04-26 19:04:14 please BLOCK any attempt to put oil drills off the southern Bklyn shoreline!!
2327 2018-04-26 19:04:00 American movies always portraying Muslims as terrorist that attack USA , but not pointing out they want their Oil..
2328 2018-04-26 19:03:50 On this quote...oil to $150?
2329 2018-04-26 19:03:47 Title of today's FFTT report: "Energy stocks, oil look vulnerable as our conviction grows that the Fed is gonna 'Shoot the Hostage' (This is also true for EM’s, weak balance sheets/credits generally.)"
2330 2018-04-26 19:03:35 Multiple explosions at Wisconsin oil refinery.  Fire, subsequent explosions, large swath of evacuations due to hazardous plume.
2331 2018-04-26 19:03:27 While the Bill Cosby news continues to dominate the cable newsers, another story worth keeping an eye on is the oil refinery explosion in Superior, Wisconsin. At least 15 people have been evacuated, and evacuations have been ordered for a several mile radius.

More on @wdiowirt
2332 2018-04-26 19:03:26 Also, take a moment to appreciate how silly his logic is. Me bringing my own oil & filter saves JL $ on the service but I can't use the coupon on a sig-serv oil change that would cost JL more $ if I used their oil/filter. I'm sure he was more concerned about his ticket average.
2333 2018-04-26 19:03:21 Ughhhhhh came to get a oil change these guys done hot me for $250  I hate being a responsible adult
2334 2018-04-26 19:03:08 The pb sandwich I made today was ok but yesterday I made a yummy grilled cheese one with butter instead of olive oil
2335 2018-04-26 19:02:53 Okuu I got the oil forgot about the massage I’m going to bang a Hell Raven
2336 2018-04-26 19:02:52 GOP has basically controlled the Senate since 2010 and if they’d stop trying to control women’s bodies; jail teachers; sucking up to oil and gas companies;... maybe they could accomplish a lot for the citizens of CO.
2337 2018-04-26 19:02:46 if you told me that, after 6 seasons, THE AMERICANS finally has Margo Martindale get shitfaced on vodka and olive oil....I'd say that's a pretty undeniably solid time investment right there no matter the murder baggage it came with.
2338 2018-04-26 19:02:38 OIL DIFF: 6.2 -> 6.33
2339 2018-04-26 19:02:29 Since I got home I’ve spilt a bottle of olive oil on the floor caught the grill pan on fire and then the WiFi stopped working  I think I’m jinxed
2340 2018-04-26 19:02:27 Chevy should notify all turbo charged trax owners  to switch their oil filter to high flow and oil to full synthetic.  Luckily I New enough about cars to save my 2015 trax from the junk yard

But there really are some funny flavours
2345 2018-04-26 19:02:08 You mean like our last PM, who put all our economic eggs in the oil patch basket, and when that started to slump, so did our economy?  And as if a Conservative never did a photo op?  Please stop confusing the issue.  Proof or stop tweeting please.
2346 2018-04-26 19:02:03 I work in the mining and oil and gas extraction industry. I worked full-time last year. I'm single. My mom was born in Canada.
2347 2018-04-26 19:01:54 How can Canadians save fuel?
Ship oil by rail, leaves grain in bins. No grain, no bread , no need to drive to store. The system run by a bunch of people educated beyond their intellect.
2348 2018-04-26 19:01:49 @nevillem
Any advice about incorperating an oil into a mixed drink without using an egg emulsion?

2353 2018-04-26 19:01:20 @SenJohnThune Terrible oil refinery fire in Superior WI. Great potential to pollute Lake Superior. I am in Ashland, WI, but I was born and raised in Winner, SD. Please have someone on your staff watch this. Everyone say a whole lot of prayers.
2354 2018-04-26 19:01:17 At 3:00pm I got a correlation buy signal for the Crude Oil WTI Futures (CLM18) and USO on my software.

2358 2018-04-26 19:01:12 DYK? The #ACPipeline will transmit #NaturalGas, not oil. Natural gas cannot dissolve in water, and therefore won’t hurt sensitive environmental features such as drinking water sources and other wetlands.

2360 2018-04-26 19:01:02 The entire city is covered in smoke from an oil refinery explosion AND i had to dial my voicemail TWICE today so it's a pretty bad day
2361 2018-04-26 19:00:55 ok. i’m really sorry for no stream today everyone. there’s been an explosion at an oil refinery near where i live, and i’m taking this time to go and make sure all my family are safe and moved away from this. please keep everyone involved in your thoughts/prayers/vibes. <3

2376 2018-04-26 18:59:57 The Husky refinery in Superior, WI has the capacity to produce 50,000 barrel of oil a day, according to wire reports. Major fire burning follow @KSTP for the latest.
2377 2018-04-26 18:59:52 Oil change and brakes tomorrow. It’s a must. I hope I didn’t fuck my rotors up lmao bc this is sad
2378 2018-04-26 18:59:51 Essential oils ma girl. Tea tree, peppermint, wintergreen, chamomile and lavender are all great starts. Make sure you’re using only topically if you’re not sure about the grade and mixing with coconut oil, they are potent 
2379 2018-04-26 18:59:43 Yea it’s actually a fun little car to drive now, at 6xxxx miles with only changing oil and to a good filter. the turbo actually boosts as before it only spooled a little, and the trax lt was so slow.  Cheap oil is why I feel the water pumps go bad so fast.
2380 2018-04-26 18:59:35 An explosion at oil refinery postpones our game until Sunday. Prayers to all involved from all of us.
2381 2018-04-26 18:59:25 Just went to @waitrose to get dinner and the tills had broken. There were queues of middle class people wondering how they were going to get their truffle oil, their wholegrain mustard, their blood orange sorbet. It was absolute carnage. 

Really makes you think.
2382 2018-04-26 18:59:24 Hi Tati! If you ever are interested in some independent Canadian beauty, the gals from @hoppyandpoppy have a beautiful shimmering setting spray with Rose Water, Witch Hazel, Shea Oil, Argan Oil, Mica Powder and a hint of Sweet Vanilla.

2385 2018-04-26 18:58:43 So that Mondelez International can use more palm oil, less expensive ingredients to make more money for yet another US corporate that is ruining the planet. Next question?
2386 2018-04-26 18:58:27 What? The evil Yankees now to the rescue? For the idiots of the Left to assure us that it's all about taking Venezuela's oil? Nahh! Venezuelan need to revolt!

2391 2018-04-26 18:57:49 Correction. Mis-read your response. No, this is a new coupon I just received in the mail. The aggressive manager told me that no coupons were accepted when you bring in you own oil & filter.
2392 2018-04-26 18:57:29 Worked great in Oklahoma! As a result of tax increases on oil production to fund their demands, 300 oil company employees are now jobless.

2399 2018-04-26 18:56:24 Press failed to report, Trump’s written objections to Russia sanctions included concerns that higher oil prices would hurt Americans & US biz.

Since 2016, oil exports are up >200%; natural gas, ~500%.
2400 2018-04-26 18:56:22 She's beautiful! I'm sorry to hear about the lymphoma. A good treatment to look into, if you have resources in your area, is cannabis oil.

2401 2018-04-26 18:56:16 So I got small chops today and I’m just here eating flour and oil as puff puff
2402 2018-04-26 18:56:14 should i take a sip some old cooking oil from my physics class
2403 2018-04-26 18:56:02 There is always one Brit nat that shows their ignorance. Ask why in 2014 three leaders pleaded for Scotland to stay. If Scotland is too poor surely that's the ideal time to get rid. London is heavily invested in oil and the US in trident. Thats mays real national interest.
2404 2018-04-26 18:56:00 I hear his understanding of Peruvian contract law is below par as well.  And don't get me started on his lack of ability to recite the law behind Indigenous land rights in Finland. 
And he calls himself a 'historian'.
Ba! Scammer! Fraud! Snake oil salesman!

2407 2018-04-26 18:55:50 Why does he need a sound proof booth.  Is it to keep us from finding out how much money the oil & chemical companies are giving him to allow them to do what ever they want to do?  How much money does it take to buy the head of the EPA? Guess he does need the sound proof booth.

2413 2018-04-26 18:55:03 Greetings Briar: Factory milk and Lily O'Brien's vanilla and refreshing flavors of Brown & herb dip mix, Nonni's rosemary olive oil
2414 2018-04-26 18:54:58 Horrible analogy. Oil also floats on water and can be collected and contained with inflatable booms.
2415 2018-04-26 18:54:46 @ReutersUS  I live in Wisconsin just 60 miles east of the refinery fire. This is of epic proportion. The refinery is just blocks from Lake Superior and poised right next to the Nemaji River. Oil has the very real potential of dumping into Lake Superior, the largest Great Lake.
2416 2018-04-26 18:54:38 If someone tells you they stir-fry things without using oil, start to reexamine everything else they've told you
2417 2018-04-26 18:54:02 So you’re invested in oil and gas? Because I’m just seeing rising prices at the pumps?
2418 2018-04-26 18:53:57 Make sure you all are using REAL olive oil. Do your research. Most brands are counterfeit!
2419 2018-04-26 18:53:56 “Today’s” research, so far, has been on ways to cook fresh asparagus & fresh Brussel sprouts . 
Plus, the benefits & uses of Nutmeg (& Nutmeg oil).
Great for sleep issues.
AND it has anti-inflammatory properties. 
Am thinking about buying the oil for my aching arm & shoulder.
2420 2018-04-26 18:52:48 Of emissions 2 save da world but shackle da people. %56 said it sounded nice, now they saying more like 30% as public likes dansound of the virtual signal and fairy dust jacinda spread around but reality sunk in & oops it’s pretty stupid policy.

2423 2018-04-26 18:52:36 Electric buses are hurting the oil industry.

About 279,000 barrels a day of fuel won’t be needed this year.

2425 2018-04-26 18:52:18 Husky Refinery in Superior, WI exploded at 10 am today. It refines tar sands oil from Enbridge pipelines, including #Line3.
2426 2018-04-26 18:52:12 What a nasty person!! Why send nasty messages about young beautiful girls, if you don’t have anything nice to say you shouldn’t say anything!!! Not exactly an oil painting yourself!!!!

2428 2018-04-26 18:52:01 Thank you, will do. Only know of prescribed oil for epileptic seizures. VA can not get close to prescribing anything of this nature.
2429 2018-04-26 18:51:37 I wouldn't mind em as a manual asset, but Ford sets all their 2009 and later automatics with em, but the pcm is buggy as shit so it burns through clutch packs like oil changes. Have heard the old fiestas are kick-ass for sleeper builds
2430 2018-04-26 18:51:34 Yes I will read when u stop reading gibberish written by court historians like thapar and congi propagandists. Read history and understand the sacrifices made by him at Andaman. Ur nehru wouldn't have sustained the oil mill for an hour let alone 11 years.

2432 2018-04-26 18:51:26 At the end of the day, is the common 'mwananchi' in Turkana going to benefit from the oil mining? Or the government is going to leave a large share of the cake to the foreign investors
2433 2018-04-26 18:51:17 lol I don't do any maintenance at a dealership ... if you're in the DMV area I have numbers.. also there is a new oil pan gasket on this car. I replaced it last month
2434 2018-04-26 18:51:12 It’s only one eye and it’s so itchy all the damn time. Where do you get your oil?
2435 2018-04-26 18:51:02 Simply no end to Alberta whiners, Horgan is a true leader with the guts to defend BC from Crudeau and his oil cartel.

2438 2018-04-26 18:50:32 Russia conspiracy got even hardcore environmentalists to ignore: Energy companies in USA produce >10 million barrels of oil per day—but still import 7.5 MBPD of higher-priced foreign oil—

because Saudi, China-gov et al. companies in USA exporting our energy future.
2439 2018-04-26 18:50:32 Yeah, ol' Joe "Traitor" Barton was also the guy that apologized to BP for their Gulf Oil spill that killed 11 people!  What the fuck is wrong with Texas?
2440 2018-04-26 18:50:31 Do you have any peppermint oil, or can you get some? It's said sniffing it is a good way to stave off hunger pangs.  (About £1 from homebargains)
2441 2018-04-26 18:50:20 You should be able to get Patchouli oil anywhere that has essential oils. Try looking on Amazon and just make sure it’s 100% or listed as an essential oil. If you find something but are unsure share the link with me and I’ll look at it.
2442 2018-04-26 18:50:17 What is a good hair oil/spray to put on my hair when I curl it? My shit be so frizzy
2443 2018-04-26 18:50:17 explosion at the oil refinery in my hometown this morning. my parents and most of the city are being evacuated.
2444 2018-04-26 18:49:43 Yeah, Iran should trust a country that ousted their legal government for oil and brought Mullahs to power. Go read a book.
2445 2018-04-26 18:49:38 Feel like one of the worst car owners ever. Finally just got my oil changed, 3,000 miles over due  #oops
2446 2018-04-26 18:49:36 I'd actually like a green party that would invest massively in green energy and turn away from oil sands.  We don't need em and can't have them.  Why can't we get a real progressive movement and stop trying to appease the status quo. People are ready for real change.
2447 2018-04-26 18:49:28 someone analyzing food: i taste a hint of cilantro and sesame oil , 3 tablespoons of salt

2452 2018-04-26 18:48:51 Let's start with it's a really stupid decision. Just like the really stupid decision to put Tzeporah Berman on Oil Sands advisory Committee. But they are free to do exactly what they want. But someone needs to stand up and say "we really screwed up" freedom of expression my ass!
2453 2018-04-26 18:48:39 Consider CND oil to help her with the cancer. I'll be praying for her recovery. My sister refused chemo & radiation...because it kills healthy cells along with the bad cells. Not saying your wife should refuse treatment. But definitely inquire about CND oil and see if it'll help.
2454 2018-04-26 18:48:38 I am curious how these anti oil people are going to get all their toys from China!  And are they going to like their winter holidays at home when jets stop flying!
2455 2018-04-26 18:48:19 Can someone check my oil? Lol idk what I’m looking for 
2456 2018-04-26 18:47:52 Mmmm...putting linseed oil on the outside table brings back memories of @lborouniversity working with the wind tunnels...goodness 15 years ago!!
2457 2018-04-26 18:47:44 Democrat's and republicans both have set by watching costs rise on not only drugs but on most other things American's buy.  And Nancy it is called anti-trust, re-member, congress brought anti-trust laws again the oil giant Sohio in the early part of the last century, do it again.
2458 2018-04-26 18:47:35 Yeah cooked it @ 350 for 15 minutes, edges layed over each other. Then put them in the cupcake tin, and then dropped a couple drops of olive oil in the bottom, added an egg in each, sprinkled a little jalapeño cheese on top, back in oven for 15 minutes - enjoy

2464 2018-04-26 18:46:58 I wonder if there is a common behavioral trait to punctuality? Like changing one’s oil regularly (probably a useless question in NYC) or flossing.
2465 2018-04-26 18:46:58 Microscopic chief have a past helping thoughts for oil economy. Todays when a scientist invention oil opposite source what he have tricks . Today's he also save corruption and oil and defeat invention.which person like invention they are torture. 
Why.?
Stop  it is not for good
2466 2018-04-26 18:46:53 Its, quite unthinkable to begin to lament about a struggling economy, when few years back national prayers were held for the gift of oil resource and the country was assured of increased revenue from oil sales. the question Ugandans needs to ask is what went wrong with our oil?
2467 2018-04-26 18:46:52 Have you been able to look into the oil extracted from cannibas? I saw reports and documentaries on how it surrounds just the cancer cells amd attacks only them...they mix it with 1 other ingredient...n the oil doesn't make you high..Canada and Germany habe come the furthest w/it
2468 2018-04-26 18:46:49 I would amend to say either "powerful" or celebrity predator. Celebrity/Rich person legal force field is quite powerful... Great line from Chill Wills in "Giant" after Jett Rink struck oil: "He's too rich to kill now."
2469 2018-04-26 18:46:43 Gotta say that pic 1 is perfect body builder contest pose, missing the oil.
2470 2018-04-26 18:46:43 Hey @Ford maybe would it be possible to make a software update to allow for checking oil percentages in the car because I'm driving a 2015 fiesta and loving it but I don't like having to go through hoops to check my vehicles health when my old mercury had that info in car

2474 2018-04-26 18:46:13 and then they want to oil themselves, reveling in their delusions that THEY understood it better and in more profound ways than anybody else.
2475 2018-04-26 18:46:12 As soon as we get rid of oil...all passengers on the planes will be on these instead of seats...keeping the props turning. #pedalorcrash
2476 2018-04-26 18:45:52 Get to work Notley...you have the legislation...they don't want our oil...let them not be denied...
2477 2018-04-26 18:45:31 They'll really need that oil.
2478 2018-04-26 18:45:06 Someone needs to explain to me the difference between oil and beer. I thought the Supreme Court just ruled on beer. What makes oil any different? Pardon my ignorance.

The power of oil on our economy is DUMB. Oil will be priced out of business or convert to clean energies.

2523 2018-04-26 18:41:27 Of course trump would try 2 take credit for an Act that was established in 2006 which gives 4 coastal states a share in the revenues produced from oil drilling in the waters along the continental shelf.

which made Russia China’s hard ally & enabled foreign companies in USA to take over Russia’s oil/NG markets by exporting our energy future.

Remember this when USA is dependent of foreign energy again.
2539 2018-04-26 18:38:44 LOL "Economic prosperity, the public good and environmental sustainability require just such an integrated approach — one the oil and natural gas industry is working hard to achieve, while detractors like Suzuki offer superficial solutions to phase out fossil fuels"

2551 2018-04-26 18:37:17 No, actually, different outcome. The bio based acts like normal plastic and doesn’t degrade when released, but reduces CO2 emissions from oil in production. The biodegradable degrades completely /decomposes. Good to clarify if I was unclear on this:)

2592 2018-04-26 18:33:15 Bush oil money got him fat
2593 2018-04-26 18:33:11 India will work to create a network with other major oil buyers in Asia, such as China, South Korea and Japan, to negotiate better terms with sellers it will definitely work to negotiate cheaper prices
2594 2018-04-26 18:33:08 The refinery in Superior is owned by a Canadian company. It's WI's only oil refinery, and handles mostly tar sands oil from Alberta. The relatively small (50,000 barrels a day) plant was in process of being upgraded and expanded.
2595 2018-04-26 18:33:04 Come on BC NDP, we need more refineries or better, we need a refinery here in BC. This is totally insane, we have to import refined fuel when we have Oil here. Unbelievable, only in Canada this nonsense happens. Too much imports. We are becoming a dependable sinking economy.

2597 2018-04-26 18:32:58 Ahhh, there was an explosion at an oil refinery in my town D: they're having to evacuate the area around it, luckily we're safe but I hope the people who got caught up in it are okay...

2607 2018-04-26 18:31:38 The oil refinery plant exploded this morning while my boyfriend and I were driving to the college. They are now evacuating the houses nearby the plant, it's still burning nearly 4 hours later and they're worried it is going to explode.
It is a very scary situation right now.

He opened his eyes after praying and could not find her.

2628 2018-04-26 18:30:06 How do we pay for it if we keep giving away or resources? "Tidewater" won't change anything dramatically. Oil production is already at record high levels and we are broke.

2672 2018-04-26 18:23:17 If the oil industry wants to turn a blind eye to the real environmental impacts of oil extraction, they are further distancing themselves from people who care about it.
2673 2018-04-26 18:23:09 I see all these like “self care things” promoting olive oil for your skin/hair care and lash growth. First of all, some people get irritated with olive oil on their face, yours truly. And it causes like a rough patch on my eyes....

3004 2018-04-26 17:44:37 Truly... He's all over Twitter generally. I get it. He's very famous. But why is he in MY? Twitter? I have a lovingly curated stream populated by markets geeks, oil experts, terrible food and anything that makes me laugh. I don't deserve this.

Hell vanished.
Tranquility encased him.
Nothing of Armand remained, not a contrail of his vile spirit.
Closing his eyes, Luke breathed in the aroma of his pipe: cherry wood, sage oil, essence of pine.
Grandfather. Shadow Wolf. His true Father.

3014 2018-04-26 17:43:31 When can I get some CBD oil?  My glaucoma is acting up.
3015 2018-04-26 17:43:30 I never noticed becos you still have amazing hair. Plus castor oil should restore it back and hair masques
3016 2018-04-26 17:43:28 If you’re at FDIC (Fire Department Instructors Conference) in Indianapolis today, tomorrow or Saturday, make sure to check out this amazing truck at the Heartland Heritage Outdoors/Supporting Heroes Exhibit in front of Lucas Oil Stadium!!
3017 2018-04-26 17:43:26 I have GUSH, FANG and APC as I agree that oil prices will be elevated but I was thinking more of EM demand. I was floored when I saw that Toyota sells 30K+ RAV4s per MONTH. I'm a sedan guy though.
3018 2018-04-26 17:43:26 You mean the Judge who goes against environmental laws? The one who dismissed evidence showing oil and gas drilling will have detrimental impact on prehistoric & historic sites of Chaco Culture National Historical Park and a World Heritage Site? Shame on LCU.
3019 2018-04-26 17:43:22 Why just pick on Cdn oil & pipeline? I wish they would protest Saudi Arabian oil & tankers, Russian oil & pipelines (to Europe), and Texas oil, refineries, and pipelines.
3020 2018-04-26 17:43:17 All i want is a job in the oil field this summer 
3021 2018-04-26 17:43:17 Can’t come down off that oil... cause I keep drinking this shit
3022 2018-04-26 17:43:12 Stalin did not bomb Iran!!! And he pulled back on those concessions in the 50s and supported Mossadegh before and after US/UK coup. Stalin exerted influence on Iran during war to protect the oil against Axis control and then British influence.
3023 2018-04-26 17:43:10 Show me anyone that isn’t an oil Barron that can stick 50 brick in escrow. Shambolic PR if it is.
3024 2018-04-26 17:43:10 Same. I have just the oil, though. I’ll check to see if my beauty store has the whole set next time.
3025 2018-04-26 17:43:09 I did 29 yrs now disabled Vet on pain pills that don't work. VA has been outstanding for me. Please legalize CBD oil for me and my Brothers n Sisters in Texas  @tedcruz @BetoORourke @SRuhle
3026 2018-04-26 17:43:05 Previous years went to Cleveland Zoo. Something happened about a month out from our trip, so they had to improvise. Troyer Farm factory and then some museum in Oil City on the way back. Long ride on school bus on Route 8 through hill and dale!
3027 2018-04-26 17:43:04 Nothing bad. Cannabinoid oil. Curious to see if it has a positive effect. It's ironic that it can be legally produced/purchased in most US states but Canada may have issue.
3028 2018-04-26 17:43:02 I tried coconut water years ago and thought it tasted like white people after hot yoga & boiled cabbage. I tried some recently and I changed my mind. It reminded me of warm beaches and thick thighs that smell like coconut oil. I been on the search for the perfect coconut water.
3029 2018-04-26 17:42:50 Mueller’s Raid shows his desperation. Like Burning the oil fields as he retreats for lack of accomplishment. Mueller’s actions/agenda belong in a “Banana Republic”. Like bill’s wife, a sore loser.

3031 2018-04-26 17:42:38 That's awesome. No one is arguing with you. All the new blood will turn Texas blue, remember? We are happy about it.
And I DAMN sure don't want people coming to Florida to drill for more 'effin oil.
3032 2018-04-26 17:42:15 hahah.. yeah.. chip oil.. prob not far off if it's OEM oil... :)...
3033 2018-04-26 17:42:06 Happy #TakeYourChildToWorkDay to everyone except those who bring their kids to the oil rigs and coal burning power plants!!!
3034 2018-04-26 17:42:05 From a technical perspective, we know this decision has to come within the next couple of months - and will coincide with dollar rally, Treasury rally, oil/commodities sell-off etc.
3035 2018-04-26 17:42:00 I keep a emergency restart kit, bottle of coolant, oil and a jack in my trunk at all times for just these cases. I'm not overly handy, but I can fix a flat or jump a battery.
3036 2018-04-26 17:41:56 The chain needs cleaning and oil. It's not too hard. I've had to learn a bunch of bike maintenance. YouTube helped me. 
3037 2018-04-26 17:41:52 Make sure you exfoliate your cheeks after any scene with lube/oil to help prevent unsightly blemishes. I recommend GoodWill for shoot clothes that you’ll probably only wear once. Cheap and nice! Also, I love you 
3038 2018-04-26 17:41:40 God's favor is like oil.. It makes life smooth and easier...
3039 2018-04-26 17:41:37 Let's build a deep water port at Churchill and start moving grain and oil through there. It can be done and should have been done years ago..

3041 2018-04-26 17:41:25 I can’t wait to be back in Den10 so I can take a PHAT NAP, but I’m stuck at my dealership waiting on my oil change.
3042 2018-04-26 17:41:10 Yesterday I woke up from a dream in which @LobShots was critiquing my stovetop popcorn technique! He asked me to dab off all the “excess oil” before he would try any. 

Didn’t even acknowledge the fact that HE’S the one who pulled the pot off the stove before it was ready.

3044 2018-04-26 17:41:01 Enemies getting allies to do leg work for them...as with Oil for Food program the wheels of Iran's nuclear program greased by many so called allies making billions from the cash stolen by Obama from our Treasury...Iran turning "six party talk" scheme used w/ DPRK against us
3045 2018-04-26 17:41:01 noticed this morning that US oil output is up 800,000 bpd since the end of 2017...that's quite a growth pace
3046 2018-04-26 17:40:58 I think they should have asked him if he loses his part-time EPA job that provides healthcare,office and travel, does he still get to keep his full time oil executive/drill planning job?!
3047 2018-04-26 17:40:38 for sure !! your right ..but if it's yellow and very transparent it's not good oil no matter what olives you are using or no??
3048 2018-04-26 17:40:26 Snake oil for the gullible? That’s harsh. You’re insulting Elon Musk, the marketing genius of the age, who envisions rockets taking off very close to inhabited places, has a beautiful  vision of cheap electric cars while not actually making any, and gets $$$$ in  gov subsidies.
3049 2018-04-26 17:40:24 This beggarly spinster consumed nothing but whale oil for 5 days and you won't believe what happened next!!!!!!!!!

3053 2018-04-26 17:40:03 You couldn’t have - low oil prices would have bankrupted Scotland. Scotland may have even defaulted on its sovereign debt that the rest of the uk would have had to underwrite

3069 2018-04-26 17:38:40 But it's fact. $100 barrel oil is not coming back so we need other markets.
3070 2018-04-26 17:38:40 No fatalities according to the report, hopefully all will survive. Unfortunate incident nevertheless

3072 2018-04-26 17:38:05 Agreed! I have no clue how these dumb asses or so blind to this. There's so narrow minded on the fact their SUVs are now more expensive to operate... That's all that matters to them. Get off the oil! :)

3084 2018-04-26 17:36:22 @johniadarola  Time for the GOP to hold a vigil for the 1,000’s of gallons of oil tragically lost in the explosion at the refinery today in Superior, WI.

3088 2018-04-26 17:35:57 ofc I'm the one to bring lavender essential oil and mist (to calm anxiety) and then albas oil to help deeper breathing (to also calm nerves and also increase oxygen uptake) into an exam and literally just sit there and sniff/spray said products in front of the external examiner
3089 2018-04-26 17:35:45 I found going to the actual car dealership for my oil changes is more...comfortable? i’m treated respectfully and my car never has mysterious “problems” pop up that cost me more than I came there for

3093 2018-04-26 17:35:39 Actually, you have to stop people believing in imaginary supreme beings. Stopping the use of oil is much simpler and will happen anyway eventually

3096 2018-04-26 17:35:11 We're practically drowning in oil right now. Why do you think it will go to $5-$6/gallon?
3097 2018-04-26 17:35:07 I like the car, but changing oil every 6 month doesn't make sense and far from green. For 3 months I filled gas only once.
3098 2018-04-26 17:35:06 Anyone got some tea tree oil? I need a few drops to put in my spray bottle
3099 2018-04-26 17:35:06 You're thinking too small. If it can be made with oil (eg fuels, lubricants, plastics, etc), it can be made with hemp.

3101 2018-04-26 17:34:58 These antics from Cruz aren’t about RIN prices, Cruz is trying to limit ethanol’s market share on behalf of Big Oil. The ethanol industry has been clear the win-win Cruz claims to seek is to grant RVP relief for E15 & higher blends. More ethanol blending=More RINs=Lower RIN $

3103 2018-04-26 17:34:55 Thank you, @JustinTrudeau & @cathmckenna for taking action on oil & gas climate pollution. Now, please ensure that the provincial ambition to address methane matches the federal model. There is no room for compromise.

3107 2018-04-26 17:34:45 PM Rowley: Queries were raised on T&T's earnings, oil contracts, etc. Shell & BP Execs met PM & delegation to discuss & Shell made an interim proposal to Gov't on increased revenue. The parties agreed to establish "empowered negotiation teams" which will meet in mid May.

3109 2018-04-26 17:34:37 Big Bend is the most beautiful area of the state & should be protected. That's why Republicans like Will need to be voted out because he puts oil/gas profits over the environment in this beautiful region. Democrats will protect the environment of the most pristine area of Texas.
3110 2018-04-26 17:34:32 Been waiting for them to finish my oil change for the past hour and a half... and I was the first car in line. Tf.
3111 2018-04-26 17:34:13 Aye, you can still get manjuu as a drop from there afterwards, though, 3-4 is probably the best grinding place actually since oil cost is lowest.
3112 2018-04-26 17:34:12 Rejected her? Tobi needs Cee C to shine, and Cee C doesn't need him to reach her pinnacle.

You'll agree with me that Cee C is a bigger personality than Alex. Tobi and Alex are actually not in Cee C's class.

Oil and water don't mix.
3113 2018-04-26 17:34:06 Wow I never use coconut oil on my skin and it's so so soft today 
3114 2018-04-26 17:34:02 Always stir peanut butter before using it. Not only will this mix back in any oil that may have separated, but it will make the peanut butter creamier and easier to spread.
3115 2018-04-26 17:33:46 If so, send them to Chattanooga...we have a "Midnite Oil" gas station here. I have a myriad of problems with the name.
3116 2018-04-26 17:33:44 bc they use ~high-smoke point grapeseed oil~
3117 2018-04-26 17:33:33 Every person that claims coconut oil works for clearing their skin literally already has clear skin bc of genetics and no one can convince me otherwise
3118 2018-04-26 17:33:30 I paid almost $80 for a oil change. You don’t get to judge me.

3130 2018-04-26 17:32:02 I found my house mate’s essential oil spilled over in the kitchen, guess I’ll smell like silver birch forever now. thank u @RishaBeth  #ISmellGood
3131 2018-04-26 17:31:44 Bad news : Argan Oil aku tertumpah separuh kat lantai bilik.  Habis duit aku.

Still sedih sbb rugi separuh. Tapi sedih dalam mewangi.

3133 2018-04-26 17:31:31 i mix mine with tea tree oil!
3134 2018-04-26 17:31:31 who wants to join my gaylympics . i'm doing it. olympics old style, no clothes, none of this "darts" crap. olive oil and little dicks
3135 2018-04-26 17:31:12 Don't show me a recipe that needs things chopped or soaked in olive oil or require more than 3 ingredients. I'm not Wonder Woman.
3136 2018-04-26 17:31:07 I will say it again this is all about jealousy towards Alberta and nothing to do with carbon output. Our prime minister is 100% behind steel and aluminum production and their carbon output easily matches the oil sands - they are well known polluters.
3137 2018-04-26 17:30:57 mayo mask. just get some mayo and puit it in your hair for a bit. or teh olaplez hair perfector. cocont oil also works.

3140 2018-04-26 17:30:44 i had to ask a friend to go pick me up because i went alone to the restaurant and two old men were super creepy asking me what i was eating, then ordering the same and kept asking stuff like if they could take the salt/oil/etc and it was so weird 
3141 2018-04-26 17:30:42 okay i have a question about the frying, im reading this blog n they say you need to fry them in a specific high temperature, was that something you paid attention to or r they being pretentious? n do u think sunflower oil is ok for it

3143 2018-04-26 17:30:31 @JackBaruth The process of fracing (no K) is not causing roads to fail.  I enjoy reading your articles but this one is not factual when it comes to the oil & gas industry.  Agree that heavy truck traffic takes its toll on roads but fracing should be left out of this.  Thanks.

3145 2018-04-26 17:30:21 I got the bump too when I first got my nose pierced and then I used tea tree oil until it went away then it never came back 
3146 2018-04-26 17:30:16 my love is like the wild hollars 
Where the mists of the morning turned
To the rich haze that turns the trees 
To oil painted swells rising about us
As we immerse ourselves in the sweet wetness
Of the creek at the base of a mountain’s folds 
3147 2018-04-26 17:30:13 Time to get the wake and bake face oil 
3148 2018-04-26 17:30:03 Check out CBD oil really helps! Legal in all 50 states
3149 2018-04-26 17:29:58 Things I’d rather do than get an oil change: anything
3150 2018-04-26 17:29:47 I started taking fish oil and vitamins even though I don't believe that those things actually help anything. 

We'll see.
3151 2018-04-26 17:29:45 #SecondAmendment
3152 2018-04-26 17:29:27 As you became the Senate President, you started cleaning the rots in the system which history will definitely be kind to you because you have saved Nigeria(ns) from losing to oil thieves.
3153 2018-04-26 17:29:11 Yes. All this accomplishes is to expose the complete lack of logic and principle in her decision to approve the project. Far better to just be honest and say: 'the oil industry's wishes are more important to me than protecting the environment'.
3154 2018-04-26 17:29:09 I used Digize essential oil on my dog to help with his nausea and ever since I put it on he hasn’t puked. My dad still wanted me to take him to the vet and get him the meds they prescribed. Digize is way cheaper...
3155 2018-04-26 17:29:09 Then put two drops of lavender oil into your bathwater. And if his erection and your guy will enjoy a soft vibration on his hands.
3156 2018-04-26 17:28:57 Caster oil. Biotin supplements and then biotin gummies. Silk pillow cases.
3157 2018-04-26 17:28:56 Ok Spirit this plane is pretty dope. I’m not sitting on lawn chairs my seat is in the front of the plane and I didn’t have to pay extras we cooking with oil here
3158 2018-04-26 17:28:55 Year's back we would be outraged at the scent of an oil price hike.Petrol now breaches all previous record's and not as much a murmur .

FUCK
3163 2018-04-26 17:28:18 White folks..the hard working smart ones WANT to be republicans...anything but that snake oil weak minded ignorantly Arrogant Democratic party...
3164 2018-04-26 17:28:18 Honestly, one of my favorite smells is when you mix linseed oil with oil paints. Reminds me of being in an art classroom and it's really therapeutic to me 
3165 2018-04-26 17:28:15 it start making sense.I wonder how oil industry guy got so reach and "powerful" ?
3166 2018-04-26 17:27:58 Don’t ever leave your car @FirestoneAuto on their promise that you oil change will be done in an hour. If you don’t stay there staring at them they will wait until you come back to start.

3173 2018-04-26 17:27:10 Thank God for good old American enginuity, if the fracking boom hadn’t happened when it did, who knows what Oblameus would have been able to do. 

That cheap oil and natural gas stymied their ability to control energy, because they couldn’t create enough pain in the masses

3180 2018-04-26 17:26:13 To be more direct, if you have an issue with people being taught jihad, infringing on the rights of Americans is not the way to go. To stop jihad you just have to get everyone to stop using oil. Those places will collapse into utter chaos.

3182 2018-04-26 17:26:08 I haven't actually heard the opposing argument on this issue before. Nice to finally hear it.
3183 2018-04-26 17:26:08 I might not know what the main industry is in another city (what is Phoenix's major industry?), but I do know what Vegas's is: that's been too much the focus. 
We know that Calgary's main industry is oil patch related, but what about Vancouver? 
Know what I mean?
3184 2018-04-26 17:26:04 Came in for an oil change. Leaving with a coolant flush, tire rotation AND oil change. Just spent a cold $225. GB fill-in. Ta-ta groceries.
3185 2018-04-26 17:26:00 So snake oil salesmen are good in your book?
3186 2018-04-26 17:25:56 หน้ากากหมีเหล็กเหมือนเสียงพี่ปาล์ม instinct เลยอ่ะ
3187 2018-04-26 17:25:51 Will this apply to foreign oil as well?
3188 2018-04-26 17:25:46 Why is your Twitter feed promoting green projects when your boss @EPAScottPruitt is working everyday to promote oil/gas/coal/chem? Why don't you tweet the truth, rather than trying to fool us into believing you care about "green" projects?! #BootPruitt
3189 2018-04-26 17:25:43 The GOP cowards have hundreds of millions, but they'll be stretched so thin as democrats raise grassroots money from all over America! We don't need the oil, coal, and dying industries $ like tobacco and #NRABloodMoney that comes from Russia
3190 2018-04-26 17:25:39 If Trump really wanted to help all Americans, he'd do something about the artificial high oil prices. Gas now $3.00 a gallon. Probably his buddies profiting...
3191 2018-04-26 17:25:34 I relentlessly searched Amazon for every single DVD movie starring Stacy Dash. Once I purchased them all and took delivery, I immediately constructed a bonfire, threw them on, slathered myself in olive oil and horse manure whilst dancing around singing Katie Perry songs.
3192 2018-04-26 17:25:31 My daughter died of lung cancer four months ago. told 2 years previously she had only weeks, managed to get some oil, survived 2 yrs w reasonable QoL. I'm sure a way can be found, it was for my lass, I believe it was legal.
Went back to Oz, legal there w SOME sources. Good luck!
3193 2018-04-26 17:25:26 Ford wanting to eliminate its cars and only carry trucks and SUVs is a very bad move. Do they not remember when gas prices spiked so hard, people unloaded their trucks and SUVs for cars? They are rolling the dice that oil prices will never skyrocket again.
3194 2018-04-26 17:25:17 .@Buddschev 
Over 3 hours expected wait time for an oil change and tire change over from witer tires.
“There’s brake service that can be done while tires are off” Clean and lube calipers”
3 HOURS
This brake service is not listed as required in the service manual?
3195 2018-04-26 17:25:15 Use coconut oil especially when preparing her food.
3196 2018-04-26 17:24:53 also read about US-west/UN blind eye to massive HR violations in Saudi. It’s all oil and money. Rest is fck all
3197 2018-04-26 17:24:52 Better deal means bad days for Indian consumer & sunny days for oil companies. Ministry for whom?  People or petroleum.
3198 2018-04-26 17:24:38 Even the new findings of his business with Russian gas and oil is ok with you non-snowflakes? Maybe we could call you all shitflakes. Shit flakes on your eyes and ears so you can't see and hear.

3205 2018-04-26 17:23:20 Gone head get rubbed in oil suuh
3206 2018-04-26 17:23:19 Old ladies behind me 
-“ever hear of CBD oil”
-“no what’s that?”
-“it’s marijuana without the psychoactive part”
- “well hell what’s the point of that, I’ll get you the good shit!”

3207 2018-04-26 17:23:19 if BC can regulate oil coming into their province(this case), can Alberta not regulate what is leaving? (bill 12)
3208 2018-04-26 17:22:58 Too soon to be capping when demand for oil is still peaking.
3209 2018-04-26 17:22:50 THATS AFTER THE DEMS BIG OIL BIG BUSINESS UNIONS AND A CORRUPT GOV. , STRIP REAL AMERICANS OF THEIR DREAM FIRST. IF YOURE WATCHING CLOSELY YOU ARE BEING REPLACED
3210 2018-04-26 17:22:49 Maybe?: “Eurodollar” contraction(creation)->higher(lower) USD->weaker(stronger) economic activity->less(more) oil demand->lower(higher) oil price. Higher(lower) oil price changes (e.g. supply related)->mixed USD effect as petro exporters need less(more) USD, China more(less) USD

3215 2018-04-26 17:22:22 @CryptoYoda1338 Hi interested in taking a look at a new crypto deal backed by oil?
We are marketing a PPM prior to an ICO in Sept?
3216 2018-04-26 17:22:17 Yes Papa I understand that people of your age is not that tech savvy and do not like to research on topics.. here it is being not paid for raw oil prices to suppliers which mounted around 43000 cr.. we just paid 1st instalment of the same and yes this credit isn't from 2014..
3217 2018-04-26 17:22:15 Can confirm that the Ouai rose hair and body oil is an absolute delight to use
3218 2018-04-26 17:22:14 Yep I put it on to set my primer. Although primer isn’t necessary if you moisturize your face I just like extra layers between my face and makeup to keep my oil... It doesn’t keep the oil away all day but it definitely lasts longer
3219 2018-04-26 17:22:12 That or coconut oil
3220 2018-04-26 17:22:08 Given that Trump only fires people if they tell the truth, Scott Pruitt's performance under oath this morning has fairly certainly cost him his job.

On the other hand, it's pretty much a done deal our next EPA director will literally be a flaming oil slick.
3221 2018-04-26 17:22:07 A5: Oh yes, last year’s most memorable food poisoning was in Chisec, Guatemala. Top advice: don’t eat pupusas fried on the top of an oil drum with a fire inside it, even though that’s very crafty and they smell very good and you’re very hungry. #JAChat
3222 2018-04-26 17:22:00 I like teflon. But I mostly use it for keyboards, you know how it is. And I have a bottle of Turtle Wax lock oil that I put on door hinges.
3223 2018-04-26 17:21:36 So, I promised a home made chili recipe today. Here you go
Awesome home made Chili recipe

What you will need 
2lbs lb. ground beef
4 cans or one large bag of Pinto beans
1 tbsp. olive oil
1/2 onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced or finely chopped
3224 2018-04-26 17:21:32 The list of scams under #Congress UPA government is too long and looks never-ending. A few more in the list are Telgi scam, Insurance scam, Telecom scam (Sukh Ram), Fodder scam, Ketan Parekh scandal, Taj corridor case, Oil-for-food programme scam, Bombay Stock Exchange Fraud
3225 2018-04-26 17:21:15 I have been cleaning and fixing my motorbike ... I now smell of oil, muck off, swarfega and a bit of sweat...

Apparently I smell ‘fucking wonderful’ 

I know it’s not Friday #manfriday
3226 2018-04-26 17:21:15 even worse zero oil access.
3227 2018-04-26 17:21:12 Two immediate issues spring to mind regarding BC's proposed permit system for the transportation of increased volumes of diluted bitumen as outlined in their reference case. 1) Given the context, does applying only to *increased* volumes of heavy oil impermissibly target TMX?
3228 2018-04-26 17:21:11 Mr. Barnes:  When you graduated 1983, there were still large undiscovered oil & gas deposits left to be found in Alberta, which large exploration companies pursued vigorously.  In 2018, there is no more to be found, and they have left.
3229 2018-04-26 17:21:04 Gotta get ready for those pesty bugs! It looks like you've got the perfect oil to do just that! Thank you so much for sharing the love with us!
3230 2018-04-26 17:20:58 He took the action based on national interest, that’s why he authorised this payment. As far as I’m concerened, this is the first time that money drawn from excess crude oil account is being brought to the National Assembly. Since they begin to operate this account.
3231 2018-04-26 17:20:57 If canola oil is used as a pesticide, why in Tarnation would you use it? The EPA registered Canola Oil as a pesticide in 2012 but was deemed not harmful to humans. At this point I don't believe the EPA's claims. Don't believe the Food and Death Administration, either. #notocanola
3232 2018-04-26 17:20:53 Just like the republicans snake oil. So glad I didn’t vote for hil or trump
3233 2018-04-26 17:20:51 These car companies are going to be fucked when all these cars are computers, batteries and 4 tires, all these stupid oil changes and dumb car shit really hurts. Lol

3235 2018-04-26 17:20:34 I've heard castor oil helps lashes quite a bit! Not sure if it'd help w/ curling, but could make them healthier.
3236 2018-04-26 17:20:34 $1 oil and $500 gold :)
3237 2018-04-26 17:20:32 Can't fathom how, other than the big gov SEIU, labor unions blindly back Democrats. The very party that accepts millions in Union donations and then destroys the industries (like coal, steel, iron ore, oil&gas) that employ their members, by pandering to environ spec interests.
3238 2018-04-26 17:20:23 Whoever makes the coffee in my office makes that shit so it looks like motor oil lol and taste trrrble

3246 2018-04-26 17:19:25 What an easy job. Introduce weekly floating oil price mechanism then claim you’re a responsible government (unlike the other, populist guys). Nearing to elections, you stop the float and artificially maintain the price to ensure “feel good factor”.
3247 2018-04-26 17:19:13 I know... I'm late to the essential oil bandwagon, but what the heck.
3248 2018-04-26 17:19:11 You lovely people

3256 2018-04-26 17:18:37 Oil and coal.  Oil and coal.  Oil and coal.  Interspersed with "There is no such thing as climate change".
3257 2018-04-26 17:18:32 PM Trudeau’s platform on oil, climate change & environment looking incredibly pathetic & oddly Trumpian after French President Macron’s speech in Washington yesterday. Breath of sanity & reason and so so badly needed.
3258 2018-04-26 17:18:25 Language is a non issue, we need someone who is Canada first, legal immigration, halt on refugees, border jumpers returned to the USA, deportation of ISIS fighters, etc, pro Canadian oil and gas, tariffs on foreign oil, seize foreign activists (jail) and assets confiscated
3259 2018-04-26 17:18:21 GREAT.. Now I need an oil change..

3262 2018-04-26 17:18:14 Thank you! 
3263 2018-04-26 17:18:06 Exactly and it’s all controlled by the Middle East, they decide what prices they sell their oil to everyone else, now don’t you think us fucking shit up over there isn’t causing some bad blood? It’s not a machine that sells to us it’s actual humans who feel some type of way

3265 2018-04-26 17:17:45 Oil is gold
3266 2018-04-26 17:17:44 such medieval thinking has to go away or when the oil dries up there will be only sand there.
3267 2018-04-26 17:17:32 @BiscuitTheCat33  So sorry for your loss. If you need something natural for ear mites and cleaning kitties ears, try virgin coconut oil. I did and my babies ears and so clean and anything licked , its good for them. Has many healthy benefits.

3272 2018-04-26 17:16:54 Stacked oil barrels in the dessert of Abu Dhabi as a work of art that will cost $350 million? Am I missing something, surely you jest
3273 2018-04-26 17:16:43 As with the oil co's Google and FB are essential interstate and int'l conveyances of comm's and commerce.  They have no substantial (have crushed) competition, can manipulate traffic and 'eyeballs' plus have clearly demonstrated willingness to 'load the dice'

They are monopolies
3274 2018-04-26 17:16:26 Rob wants tax cuts to oil cos and budget cuts to schools

3282 2018-04-26 17:15:35 BC reference question is on draft legislation that would require KM to provide info on health/env'l impacts of heavy oil; demonstrate prevention measures; ensure financial resources available, and pay compensation for any spill.
3283 2018-04-26 17:15:29 alright folks, time to run the lawnmower for the first time this year

just gonna need some gasoline, 4-cycle engine oil, coffee, ear plugs, donuts, safety glasses, safety gloves, ice water, power-ade, a battery charger for the weed-eater, my phone, maybe some mcdonalds

3285 2018-04-26 17:15:09 Your car requires oil go do that today
3286 2018-04-26 17:15:09 You're the one who made the claim that "the difference per head in spending is larger than the cost of servicing the remote areas."

I've already given an example of how UK has damaged Scotland economy. Another one is not creating an oil fund to offset downturn in oil industry.
3287 2018-04-26 17:15:00 Bro I’ve been waiting for like 2 hrs for an oil change This shit annoying
3288 2018-04-26 17:14:57 Ok It’s that time of year to get the raffle going for the @NeuroblastomaUK - the hamper is coming along but we need more goodies so we can sell more tickets for this charity @KikkomanUK @maldonsalt @great_oil
3289 2018-04-26 17:14:53 After I made the impression I coated the surface with a mixture of oil-based food coloring and vegetable oil, put it in the freezer to chill, and then wiped the excess coloring from the surface with a paper towel. Similar to inking an engraved plate in #printmaking.
3290 2018-04-26 17:14:48 Crude Oil prints fresh session low at 67.70. #forex #CRUDEOIL
3291 2018-04-26 17:14:42 You bought one of the best kitchen gadgets ever made!

Amazing what little oil is used.

Looking forward to a cooking video when you get a chance.
3292 2018-04-26 17:14:41 Dragon Energy? You mean the independent oil company in the Anadarko basin? Oh, wait... I bet this was a Big Lebowski reference. I've GOT to see that movie!
3293 2018-04-26 17:14:25 This spinach, cucumber, blueberry, coconut oil smoothie is actually pretty damn tasty.
3294 2018-04-26 17:14:16 Have you tried tea tree oil? 
3295 2018-04-26 17:14:14 coconut oil + highlighter >>>>>>
3296 2018-04-26 17:14:12 This is the same guy that apologized to BP for the way they were treated by the WH and Congress during hearings on Deepwater Horizon disaster. In the pockets of big oil
3297 2018-04-26 17:14:06 The job comparison is  jobs created  based on millions invested.  It doesnt factor in the already existing 200,000 jobs in the oil sector.  That's a 13.5 billion investment to recreate that many jobs in other energy just to get us neutral.
3298 2018-04-26 17:13:59 I put Aloe Vera water and coconut oil in my smoothies.... Shits 
3299 2018-04-26 17:13:47 People use cat litter to clean up oil spills? Hopefully this helps....

3302 2018-04-26 17:13:35 The gall of the @UAlberta_Eng Dean and everyone who think like him. If you don't unequivocally support Alberta's fossil fuel industry you must despise everyone in this province, right? Nevermind how it keeps us tied to global oil prices over which we have no control...
3303 2018-04-26 17:13:14 It is AMAZING how incredible hydrating, exfoliating, deep conditioning, moisturizing and dipping your entire body in coconut oil makes you feel.
3304 2018-04-26 17:12:18 I agree. But I work in oil and gas. Who is going to feed and clothe my children while I transition and re-train? How much oil do we need to manufacture solar panels etc? It's not so staightforward.
3305 2018-04-26 17:12:17 finally broke down &made lotion today.

trying to find store bought lotion i'm not allergic to & actually likes my skin is all but impossible. making my own is a pain tho, so been trying to get by on just almond oil.

it's not enough. skin has been unhappy. so today's lotion day.
3306 2018-04-26 17:12:14 I feel like taking every bone and joint in my body off, change their oil and run some maintenance and place them back again   
3307 2018-04-26 17:12:11 Helped a little old man figure out which oil is best for cooking and then spent 15 min talking to him about the loss of all his children and wife. God bless that sweet man!! 
3308 2018-04-26 17:12:03 I tried both and neither works for me lol but it’s ok I use Shea Moisture’s Jamaican castor oil conditioner masque and their curl smoothie. You should do the Aztec clay mask on your hair if you haven’t already.
3309 2018-04-26 17:11:57 Putting peppermint oil on my wrists is one of my faves
3310 2018-04-26 17:11:47 Bro we are already a net oil exporter and have been for years
3311 2018-04-26 17:11:46 The simplest question I have for @TuckerGoodrich is this:
If I no longer consume seed oils (which I don't), then do I need to sweat this ratio at all? How clear is the evidence that spiking n-6 with a handful of walnuts is NOTHING AKIN to spiking it with soybean oil?
3312 2018-04-26 17:11:21 Yeah really.  #Skagit in Washington State, USA is really being impacted by these oil trains.  More of them to the #Anacortes refineries every week.... and with respect Jason & Kris, we're always one oil train away from a major tragedy.  So pipelines yes!
3313 2018-04-26 17:11:19 Also has lavender oil in as zinc dioxide can sting.
3314 2018-04-26 17:11:16 Hilary Clinton once said South Sudan oil is either blessing or course. Stop oil follows and war will stop.
3315 2018-04-26 17:11:15 Omo nah to go find engine oil grease some kind places oh...
3316 2018-04-26 17:11:04 Where does oil come from? A large portion of the worlds that is?
3317 2018-04-26 17:10:54 who do i talk to about CBD/THC oil + dose + ratio + quality product, now that the Dr has give the "OK" ?
3318 2018-04-26 17:10:50 So after that accident I developed this phobia for bleaching palm oil...I can't remember the last time I made or ate Ofada stew
3319 2018-04-26 17:10:46 Very impressed with homemade orangey-smelling sunscreen using mango butter and zinc dioxide with some turmeric essential oil to reduce some of the whiteness.
3320 2018-04-26 17:10:45 Meanwhile back at the ranch we have science-denying Scott Pruitt, Ryan Zinke, and a Republican Party polluting the environment and keeping us in the dark ages of oil and gas. Pathetic.
3321 2018-04-26 17:10:37 the act of refining oil (Texas largest export) happens primarily in Port Arthur (A solid red town in Jefferson county on the coast) 
(highest GDP production in the state)

3325 2018-04-26 17:10:12 Data from the Minnesota Coronary Experiment (randomized-controlled-trial) showed that replacing sat. fat with corn oil decreased cholesterol but caused greater all-cause mortality (people died at a higher rate). Cholesterol not considered a risk factor for CVD for over a decade.
3326 2018-04-26 17:10:11 He’s corrupt to the core. What’s harmful is climate chaos and the monster hurricanes caused by excessive CO2 emissions from fossil fuels.  Disclose your contributions from coal, oil, and gas companies, @FreedomWorks.

3330 2018-04-26 17:09:59 So people ask me what I do for work or if I even work yes I work oil fields and I sit in my truck and watch people work and I was healing from an accident so I was off for 2 1/2 months.

3333 2018-04-26 17:09:32 The fact that these cryptotech nerds havent understood yet that inflation and natural resource plays is the name of the game, is just breathtaking.

3334 2018-04-26 17:09:17 Did you know: Hempworx CBD oil has a 98% absorption rate!!! Few drops on your tongue and Bam!!! That’s awesome!! Who has tried CBD oil??
3335 2018-04-26 17:09:11 Not a lot helps my headaches but rubbing peppermint oil on my temples relieves it almost immediately.. it comes back so you have to keep reapplying though. Other than pain killers I think just water and napping or laying down in a dark room will help

3342 2018-04-26 17:07:42 I could tolerate this pipeline (and others already underway) if Canada ban all future bids for oil & gas exploration. Just a thought.
3343 2018-04-26 17:07:37 @SenateDems @SenateGOP How big of a lie do you have to tell the Senate to not get confirmed as SoS? Also how much foreign oil  $$ do you have to have to be considered to have a conflict of interest? Asking for a country.

3352 2018-04-26 17:06:48 Yeah. This place is all meat and only meat. Once I tried to eat the fries they got, but they tasted like friend fish cause they were cooked in the same oil so I couldn't.

3354 2018-04-26 17:06:39 @PutinRF_Eng The highest punishment you can give to Britain is to cut the oil supply from Nigeria to Britain, Biafra owns the oil not Nigeri
3355 2018-04-26 17:06:31 We disagree with Iran's military intervention in other countries. Iran's capital should be spent on development and progress of the country and the youth. Our oil money should not threaten global peace.
3356 2018-04-26 17:06:28 My thoughts are with my fellow Wisconsinites in Superior after today's devastating Husky Energy oil refinery explosion. Our deepest sympathies are with the refinery's workers and their families at this difficult time.
3357 2018-04-26 17:06:23 Seems very peculiar that the Horgan BC crowd can't rationalize this basic undeniable fact. The oil will move! Pipelines are the safest way!
3358 2018-04-26 17:06:16 Trump wants to sell arms pulling out will do just that. Tension.  Raise oil prices. America has its own oil so war theater will hurt oil trans

3379 2018-04-26 17:04:45 If you ask an oil industry person, they'll say dilbit isn't any more problematic than any other kind of crude oil.  I don't know why they're married to piping in dilutent and piping out sludge.  At the very least, it seems inefficient.  We can be innovative (when all else fails.)

3381 2018-04-26 17:04:42 Neither is autonomous driving. EVs are on average 10 times cheaper to run than internal combustion engines. Even with cheap oil nobody will want antiquated, unreliable and gutless internal combustion powered cars.

3403 2018-04-26 17:02:39 Agree with Ilan. And if Trump fails to extend the JCPOA-related oil sanx waivers by May 12, it is a violation of the #IranDeal - no ifs, ands, or buts. And Europe will also get more serious about steps to insulate their trade/investment with Iran from U.S. secondary sanctions.

3518 2018-04-26 16:47:07 That's like saying you should go back to a horse and carriage because you don't want to give your car an oil change.

Just keep doing the updates or at lease applying patches. If your workflow is good, it shouldn't be that hard.
3519 2018-04-26 16:47:01 UN reports indicate that there is acute shortage in the oil derivatives and an increase in prices in the area under the control of Iranian backed Houthi Militias, while there is 11979 Ton diesel & 84326Ton petrol in the is prevented from unloading in  #Hodidah port by the militia

3536 2018-04-26 16:45:02 Yeah, in a limited sense, it’s a statement about the price of oil.  If gas prices start shooting up above $4 a gallon again, NewFord may have some exposure.
3537 2018-04-26 16:44:55 Why the oil prices going up since days ago ??

3541 2018-04-26 16:44:35 The best way to prep your skin for winter season esp for dry skin
1. Moisturizer 
2. Oil based elixir. Any elixir will do.         3. Primer. Cream type. Eg: innisfree mineral moisture. Korean primers are the best. Then start your foundation/bb cream. Glass skin there you go!

3549 2018-04-26 16:43:59 Can we take a quick look at the predicted world energy demand mix in 2040? 

oil              3%
gas            27%
coal           33%
nuclear      17%
hydro         7%
wind           5%
other REs   8%

Natural gas and REs will not meet the future demand for power without coal.
3550 2018-04-26 16:43:45 On a somewhat related note, in 1942 Hannah Arendt predicted that after the war a new Muslim commonwealth would emerge, mainly made up of former British territories, and that they would use oil as a wedge between the US and Europe.

3578 2018-04-26 16:41:36 I have exceptions to this, for example, "Owning Extinctions" was made during a time when all I could think about was the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, and the work reflects and expresses that.

3580 2018-04-26 16:41:33 En 1937 murió John D. Rockefeller, dueño del mundo, rey del petróleo, fundador de la Standard Oil Company.

3585 2018-04-26 16:41:02 BOYYYY do i regret ignoring my dad when he used to try and teach me how to tune up my car. Cus i would do all this shit myself if i could than listen to niggas suggest a million dollars worth of things to be done for a standard oil change 
3586 2018-04-26 16:40:55 I know you're happy and everything but this is because the country is trying to find new sources of income other than OIL that's why we had more payment and less production 
But it will change according to the plan

This filament array visualizes how they're using HAARP to melt the arctic ice cap so they can access the oil beneath & blame it on global warming w/ the simultaneous added benefit of tweaking world population's end-times paranoia/anxiety & keep oil prices up.

3601 2018-04-26 16:39:38 The px of paper oil is because all global benchmarks are backwardated  we are pulling crude (or what's commercially available) out of storage wherever we can find it because underlying demand is very strong refiners are running to meet that dmd by loading up on crude

3604 2018-04-26 16:39:17 The sooner we get rid of the need for oil, the sooner America will turn over a new leaf...
3605 2018-04-26 16:39:07 $70 oil change is unethical

3615 2018-04-26 16:37:59 I think oily skin to an extent. I don’t think it does much for acne. Omg yes I remember why I stopped using it. It contains sodium laureth sulphate which dries out the skin & makes it more oily. & more oil = more acne. Although still didn’t break me out.

3622 2018-04-26 16:36:42 nobody will overpay millions to build an oil refinery in the middle of a city; market land prices determine what gets build where in a much more efficient way than city bureaucrats

3629 2018-04-26 16:35:50 “Oil is listed as optional.” 
3630 2018-04-26 16:35:50 Part of the answer to your question is found within your question; "exporting more oil".
3631 2018-04-26 16:35:47 I smell something dirty with all these explosions (planes, trains, now our oil, etc)
3632 2018-04-26 16:35:46 To explain the previous tweet NY is already not performing at the national average for checking companies for environmental compliance especially stacks. We cannot trust that  NY will oversee 3 extra gas/oil plants in the Hudson Valley.
3633 2018-04-26 16:35:18 You're not, but okay.
3634 2018-04-26 16:35:17 See if you are nice to people who do services for you they are extra nice back. I have a bff at my oil change place so that’s never not going to come in handy

3654 2018-04-26 16:33:40 Rosehip oil! They sell it on amazon and it’s awesome!
3655 2018-04-26 16:33:38 It makes perfect sense if you're a powerful American oil company & want exclusive access to monopolize Alberta oil to buy at 1/2 price.
3656 2018-04-26 16:33:35 Small white flowers in autumn. Full name of plant is fatsia japonica. Common name is castor oil plant.  Evergreen.  Best to grow it for the leaves rather than the flowers. Will grow in lower light levels.
3657 2018-04-26 16:33:27 spaghetti squash! Out what ever kind of sauce you like or just some olive oil. You would think you are eating pasta.
3658 2018-04-26 16:33:21 And MAKE the consumer PAY the oil overlords.  THIS is why they had Trump quash the solar and other alternative energy efforts.  It’s times like these, when Trump closes off oil sources, they can really gouge the consumers.  People, STOP being sheeple!!!

3676 2018-04-26 16:31:30 I think the waiting time for an oil change is why I’ve been avoiding it. An hour & a half wait is killing me already.
3677 2018-04-26 16:31:30 Which ban would increase reliance on the government? That's the one that will make the streets safest!
3678 2018-04-26 16:31:29 Both are a certainty. The latter involves less suffering.
3679 2018-04-26 16:31:26 .@ColoradoEA did you know Colorado gives oil and gas companies $250 million in tax breaks each year?  Good chunk of change that could go to our schools!

3687 2018-04-26 16:30:58 ofcom are nuts. They are trying to say that only academics who make a great deal of money pushing the scam should be heard. That is in no sense impartiality any more than only having an oil exec talk about oil companies.

3705 2018-04-26 16:29:16 You're leaving out that it's done for meat, and also for the oil, even the flippers are harvested and eaten. Majority of the seal is harvested but I guess you refuse to look at ALL of the facts.
3706 2018-04-26 16:29:16 Premier @jjhorgan says #BCGov has jurisdiction over its coast but adds #FedGov has jurisdiction over oceans. Says should there be a spill, oil arriving on the coast would be provincial jurisdiction. #bcpoli #abpoli

3717 2018-04-26 16:28:20 100! Just had to miss an obligation because the guy at the oil change station messed up my car. Sucks I lost on this opportunity, but it’s not the end of the world.
3718 2018-04-26 16:28:14 His attitude towards the environment, science based investigation and research, his sleeping with Big Oil, his self professed actions against environmental regulations, BEFORE being nominated for EPA Chief speaks volumes about trump, Congress, GOP.

3734 2018-04-26 16:26:30 Whenever he's asked about renewable fuels,  #Pruitt calls for "transparency" in RIN markets.  He is granting billions of gallons of waivers to oil refineries and refusing to disclose the volumes, the recipients, or any other information. The opposite of transparency #BootPruitt
3735 2018-04-26 16:26:09 You might try using a wet washcloth & gently rubbing, or trying  mineral oil or rubbing alcohol. That may help with that sticker residue. Thank you.

3737 2018-04-26 16:26:07 In general, politicians fund & deregulate what they love, & defund & regulate the crap out of what they hate.

So Republicans love Wall St, banks, oil companies, frackers, & opioid makers, & hate teachers, kids, & everyone else without nine zeros at the end of their bank balance.
3738 2018-04-26 16:26:02 #BREAKING Police in #Wisconsin say there are at least 20 casulties following an explosion at an oil refinery.
3739 2018-04-26 16:26:00 yep. And that is why people get rich selling the red/blue back to the constitution snake oil to the people They don't pose a threat they perpetuate the prison.
3740 2018-04-26 16:25:58 Is he asking for higher prices for oil...I don't understand what kind of consequences he is asking for people in BC...cause even companies in BC are shutting down because of this government @jjhorgan
3741 2018-04-26 16:25:56 Oil refinery in Superior, Wisconsin, reportedly explodes, casualties reported. JSOnline will have a story shortly.
3742 2018-04-26 16:25:48 These feelings are not surprising from people who can't bear the thought of giving up their expensive vehicles and homes, bought with their oil wages, for the safety of the earth and the air we breath. That anyone else would also enjoy some of those profits would make...
3743 2018-04-26 16:25:47 Too much is fake. The south pole treaty , for the environment they say. Shell gets permission to check for oil and gas. Yeah right.
There is south pole camera footage. But they cut out 9 hours every day.
3744 2018-04-26 16:25:32 It baffles me why you would go out of your way to support a lead tainted snake oil salesman and  performance artist, who deals daily in the art of half truths to rile up the easily duped and susceptible to conspiracies and fear, just to sell snake oil to those easily duped.
3745 2018-04-26 16:25:26 So now you get s free oil change and dinner?

3749 2018-04-26 16:24:36 Remember Sowell? It is culture. Every new administration is an owambe. The higher the oil price the more lit the turn-up.

3754 2018-04-26 16:24:03 I must admit I'm probably guilty of doing that from time to time; I think part of it is that everything is recorded and monitored now but we still have snake oil salesman and people in power just openly lying and getting away with it despite this, which is kind of a novelty.
3755 2018-04-26 16:23:56 There’s been a explosion at the Oil Refinery in Superior  Im hearing a lot of casualties and many injured 
3756 2018-04-26 16:23:50 C'est faux évidemment : jusqu'en 1980, le nucléaire représente moins de 10% du mix électrique français. L'électricité bon marché et abondante de l'après-guerre, c'est l'hydroélectricité pas l'atome.

3758 2018-04-26 16:23:48 Let's be honest it isnt a carbon tax.
 It's HST basically driving inflation and passed on to consumers in compound. It is used in compensation for industry killed by incompetence to get things done ie former Alberta energy minister, " We are not in the business of oil."

3768 2018-04-26 16:22:49 The province is asking the BC Court of Appeal to review proposed amendments to the Environmental Protection Act. Would require companies seeking to increase shipments of heavy oil to get a permit.

3839 2018-04-26 16:21:39 Refusing to give money to them isn't telling them how to run their initiatives.

Environmentalism isn't divisive, but the pipeline protests aren't environmentalism. They don't want the oil to stop, as evidenced by their upset at our threat to cut them off.

3886 2018-04-26 16:18:01 Commodities, particularly oil, tend to perform well during late stage of economic expansions. Growth becomes inflationary and Fed hikes, often tipping the economy over into recession...
3887 2018-04-26 16:18:01 Relating the Second Boer War to today, we see another war for economic motives as it is a war fought for resources. We see this within the U.S. from conflicts like fighting for oil in Iraq or rubber in Vietnam

And making off the grid solar and wind power (gold required) to not use oil, and or gas fam come on
3931 2018-04-26 16:12:12 The point being that America, Switzerland, Korea, and Lichtenstein have such low murder rates because of capitalism, whereas places like Venezuala, despite being plentiful in oil and farmable land is suffering from toilet paper shortages because of socialist policies.

3939 2018-04-26 16:10:35 Btw,  $22b in remittance is almost about 1/2 of what we make from oil sales every year. Coupled with the fact that most Western countries will have aged populations by 2035. I think Nigeria will be fine without the oil. #staypositive ;-)
3940 2018-04-26 16:10:23 Once I find a woman whose willing to make me a protein shake every morning before I wake up & rub CBD oil over my body, ...I might just marry the jig.
3941 2018-04-26 16:10:19 Kochs keep pushing oil for June to over $74 @bbl. Is there a glut? Yes. Is there insider trading by the Kochs and their Russian partners? Yes. Is demand at a near record low? Yes.
3942 2018-04-26 16:10:17 @Fadec92 Richard, do Hnr get 7.5% of the oil sales from the wells straight away or do we have to wait till True have recouped their costs first.
3943 2018-04-26 16:10:08 I'd lick till that last bit of oil's polar end doesnt get dissolved with my salivas polar end and drive it into my mouth!

3946 2018-04-26 16:09:56 Is it just me??? In 2008 the price of crude oil was $145 per barrel and gasoline was about $1.35 per litre. Now the price of oil is about $67.00 per barrel of crude oil and the price of gas is higher than it was in 2008. am I missing something? can someone explain, please.
3947 2018-04-26 16:09:55 A better way to transport oil and gasoline disregarding optimization and focusing on minimization of accidents and environmental harm...

3956 2018-04-26 16:08:57 Most important single factor in determining the survival of gorillas was the presence of park guards to deter poachers. A huge concern in West Africa is the removal of forest for agriculture/oil palm or rubber plantation, which is "habitat for little anymore, except weeds.”

3980 2018-04-26 16:05:36 So if Scott Pruitt does get the boot (as he should), the real trick is going to be replacing him with someone who, unlike him, DOESN'T want to destroy/pollute the entire world as collateral for enriching coal and oil companies, right? Can we make sure that second part happens?

C) A tracheostomy pales in comparison to starvation.

4032 2018-04-26 16:00:17 I'm big into oil. I own lots of it and I know what it smells like. It's rich smelling. The smell itself spawns property and mansions.
4033 2018-04-26 16:00:17 Haan bae ofc. Actually my mother occasionally tell me to block 'flaan khala ki beti/beta' after they legit call her asking "Bakhtawar k baal achay hogye hein, aap konsa hair oil use krti hein?"

4046 2018-04-26 15:58:56 Hell he was threatening this if he lost the election, because that would prove it was "rigged." Trump is very Saddam Hussein-like, in that if he goes down, he wants to burn everything down with him (i.e., set the oil fields on fire).
4047 2018-04-26 15:58:56 Ian you need an indian grocery shop but the alternative is use sunflower oil and make as normal. Make 1 tsp mustard paste using Colman’s mustard powder and water . When the dish is finished add the mustard paste - not too much or else it will be too pungent. X
4048 2018-04-26 15:58:54 I did not expect to get through 2 whole episodes of Fixer Upper when I stopped in this morning for an oil change.
4049 2018-04-26 15:58:52 I love this oil on simple salads or fresh bread. I tasted it first in #Extremadura last week in a place that used to press olive oil but is now a hotel. Good point about other nations taking the glory ...

4051 2018-04-26 15:58:27 Yes pls! I also sauteed 5-6 sliced garlic cloves for 20sec or so to mellow them out and throw them and the sautee oil in. Serve with Crystal or Louisiana hot sauce of course.

4058 2018-04-26 15:57:29 There’s to much oil and gas in the ground to consume by sociëty at the rate it can be extracted therefore producers make agreements on production levels to maintain the price they desire. #framing
4059 2018-04-26 15:57:23 Maybe so but how are they protecting the child by starving him? Would you not do anything you could  to save your child’s life even if the chances were slim at best?
4060 2018-04-26 15:57:21 Opposite. 
1. Data proves California has NO fast growing city in percentage terms.
2. Seattle is NOT on top 15 cities so grows faster anyway, has catching up to do and YET added ONLY 2000 more people compared to Houston, which is TOP 4
3. AND oil involves science, not software
4061 2018-04-26 15:57:16 All that as opposed to a certain death by starvation, right? Your priorities are really mixed up.

Look, this is a much more nuanced issue than you want it to be. That's okay. But it's clear that the state has a legitimate role in protecting the child's interests over those of his parents.

4080 2018-04-26 15:54:59 George Bush invaded Iraq for no good reason.
It was all a lie.
They took out Saddam because he wanted a gold-&-oil-based dinar --- the same reason we took out Gaddafi.
Bush began the destruction of the Middle East & the mass immigration/invasion of Muslims into Europe & the U.S.

4086 2018-04-26 15:54:27 They're taking them off because they don't sell. The focus and fiesta are one of the least reliable cars you can get at the moment. The fusion and taurus are far behind the Camry and accord (each came this year with new model). They'll regret it tho as oil prices are going up

4090 2018-04-26 15:53:56 We really talking about gas and oil cars though when Ford, Chevy, Toyota, and Kia are pushing for full electronic lineups by 2020? That’s only 3 years away bro, oil will have no use, most companies like Tesla are even pushing for off the grid power supplies to factories
4091 2018-04-26 15:53:41 That sounds more like hydroseed spray and not a oil/water/acrylic/dye mix, is paint generally caustic?

4095 2018-04-26 15:53:17 it may be dreaming, but the idea is drive economy today to it's maximum, export max oil and gas while reducing domestic consumption and use proceeds from exports to build leading renewables industry over coming decades.

4148 2018-04-26 15:48:37 Yes. Residual solvent is only one issue. Oil inhalation (can cause pneumonitis), terpene combustion (into carcinogens), vast dosing are others.

4255 2018-04-26 15:39:09 Increasing the amount of oil tankers sailing out of the Burrard Inlet and through our coastal waters is the farthest thing away from "protecting our oceans & our environment" as you can get. You're a #climatedisaster !
4256 2018-04-26 15:39:08 Why the hell are we still sending oil out of the country we should be keeping and refining our oil in Canada
4257 2018-04-26 15:39:06 Mr. Kenny - I back your stance in getting oil to mrkt to rid the monopsony the US has on us. But, we can't make assumptions on rail ops. It IS more dangerous to ship via rail but the logjam refers to oil glut and not necessarily logjam of other commodities on the rail system.
4258 2018-04-26 15:39:04 Apparently there was a big explosion and now a fire at the oil refinery right by my work?? I can see the smoke from here omg I hope nobody got hurt

4280 2018-04-26 15:36:25 Right now Canada exports most of its oil to the US and we have to take what they offer - which is often a discount to posted prices. We have no ability to export to other markets that would pay more because there is no way to get the oil to them.

4308 2018-04-26 15:33:45 This move will cost Ford serious sales both in Canada now (where gas is more heavily taxed than the US) and in the USA when gas prices eventually spike as the supply of gasoline tightens up as OOEC gets their act together and starts squeezing the price of oil higher again
4309 2018-04-26 15:33:30 The price oil producers receive is pretty transparent and many are not making as much money as you think - look at the refiners.

4372 2018-04-26 15:28:31 Besides which.. diversifying an economy takes investment. Right now that means the province and the country would need to invest in Alberta. 
That's happening to a small amount but not enough to break the oil addiction.
4373 2018-04-26 15:28:31 Our son (18 years old) has not eaten for years, which contains palm oil - and that's his choice ... We do not either

4383 2018-04-26 15:27:59 And the point is?  Candles used to light houses until oil lamps came along?  Leeches used in medicine before antibiotics.  So what?

4390 2018-04-26 15:27:26 Simple skincare routine starts with cleansing using micellar water, then a scrub with black soap mixed with lime and brown sugar to exfoliate and brighten. Then I moisturise, if it's before I start my day I use a sunscreen and if I'm going to bed I just use an oil.

4395 2018-04-26 15:26:59 Did you soak your hair with coconut oil? I suggest you soak it overnight then apply the bleach that's what I did to my hair and It didn't even get any damage 
4396 2018-04-26 15:26:57 During the last oil boom, I heard a welder in the Dakota’s could bring in 120k per year.
4397 2018-04-26 15:26:36 We have tons of Oil. Our leader won’t give us access to it. Only high priced, imported oil is good enough for us.
4398 2018-04-26 15:26:26 Ummm ya, the rest of the world doesn't drive cars, use electricity, eat our crops, burn our oil. You really are very uninformed in every way, but that's the way socialists and communists like their slaves.
4399 2018-04-26 15:26:23 No problem!! Coconut oil will also help with peeling

4401 2018-04-26 15:26:14 Given all 3 parties favour government subsidization of hydro rates to keep it cheap, perhaps it's now time to bring back the national energy program, and do the same for heating oil and gasoline!

The PCs sound like the NDP and the NDP sound like PCs ...
4402 2018-04-26 15:26:09 This stupid gov sucking our blood in the name of tax terrorism. Oil prices are sky high and he don't want to bring it under control coz he has an agenda to suck peoples hard earned money.
4403 2018-04-26 15:26:04 The "War on Terror"

4405 2018-04-26 15:26:00 that should sort out most problems, but if it's still bugging u, u can do moisturizing masks (coconut oil or drugstore), but omg effort
otherwise, consider a shampoo like head and shoulders that's meant to treat itchy dry scalps!
4406 2018-04-26 15:26:00 Really feel like I be getting oil changes every month smh
4407 2018-04-26 15:25:59 Got to go get a oil change for the new whip
4408 2018-04-26 15:25:58 Great job “watchdog”! A Secretary of Defense who failed to disclose oil business ties to China. You might be the phoniest glad handing hypocrite in the GOP, and there are many.
4409 2018-04-26 15:25:51 Oiling problem? Those bearings are toast. Not enough oil or tolerances wrong?

4412 2018-04-26 15:25:25 Militants from Niger Delta and residents from oil producing areas fight for more money but they seldom fight for their environment. Look into the mirror and see who is responsible for this soot.

Oil is not working for Nigeria bcos of the first 2 problems while Venezuela is lagging due to the 3rd.

4433 2018-04-26 15:22:35 People are really struggling out here. A lot of people are desperate for oil and gas to rebound. 
Shame because it probably won't at this rate. But I understand people's frustrations.

4436 2018-04-26 15:22:23 どうしよう

4439 2018-04-26 15:22:00 Look for foreign oil companies to be dropping out of joint ventures with PDVSA in the future. Refusing to sign “bad contracts” is not grounds for arrest. The oil industry in #Venezuela continues to spiral into chaos.

4444 2018-04-26 15:21:47 i found the second week i had to use a hydrating sheet mask afterwards cos it felt a bit tight, but doing that after has made it plain sailing since. but that's just preference, i'm too used to feeling like an oil slick so that just felt weird!
4445 2018-04-26 15:21:42 Gold is more valuable than oil lol
4446 2018-04-26 15:21:38 Doubt capex expansion comes except for possibly energy where massive 2014-2016 cuts have left room for some catch up. If trump nixes Iran deal higher oil prices may incentivize more spending

* The only oil refinery in his state is owned by Ergon, Inc.

* Ergon and its employees have donated at least $18,500 to McKinley's campaigns.
4458 2018-04-26 15:20:55 Crude oil is a fossil fuel. It’s formed from the remains of plants and animals, mainly plankton, that died millions of years ago and were buried in mud. Over millions of years, w high temp and pressure, the remains turn to crude oil.

4511 2018-04-26 15:16:24 Oil prices rise further to motivate more risk-taking by E&P co's globally, more long-lead E&P capex, better pricing for many more Svc co's (enabling reinvestment in their fleets and to incentivize young people in).  Then and only then can this upcycle properly progress

Do you remember the presidential handshake that caused ripples in the country? The dust had settled but now the URA boss has been ordered to recover the sh6b given to those involved in the oil case. Why is this case coming back now?

4514 2018-04-26 15:16:14 You are. Letting his parents take the child to Italy, risking more suffering (seizures, possibly death in transit) to perform a tracheostomy (invasive surgery) and continued ventilation is a warped thing to do.
4515 2018-04-26 15:16:13 The oil prices will hold for while .The full size SUVs(Excursion) are long gone and the mid size suvs have become very fuel efficient and do not cost a lot more to run vis a vis small cars.
4516 2018-04-26 15:16:06 Israel want its oil! Saudi Arabia wants its oil. And US Taxpayers will pay the bill!
4517 2018-04-26 15:15:46 Buhari's interest is our oil and that was the reason he has been fighting to be President.  He is petroleum minister and only him knows the amount generated and embezzled.  Leave oil and face security issues which demands urgent actions
4518 2018-04-26 15:15:43 2/2  Love to read an honest, candid interview with Ed Stelmach. Total oil stooge who got eviscerated trying to recalibrate resource royalties. Wonder if he’s bitter? I mean probably not but...
4519 2018-04-26 15:15:31 Should we take Pappu so seriously?Everyone knows he himself does not what he speaks. He blurts out only half of what his tutors burn midnight oil 2 teach him.Then it invariably ends up in one faux pass or the other!And he is so thick skinned that he doesn't even feel embarrassed!
4520 2018-04-26 15:15:28 Those numbers don't include tight oil or shale gas either (except for the shale gas that is liquefied).

4525 2018-04-26 15:15:16 IMO Pruitt looks at cost to oil, gas and coal industries because of regulations and doesn't give a damn about clean water or clean air.

4529 2018-04-26 15:15:07 My partner purchase it and apparently all on the shelf were like this so they thought that was normal, but, I've never seen olive oil look like that. It has always been clear

4543 2018-04-26 15:13:37 If you get an oil face or are prone to getting acne here and there, I like to use a combination of African black soap & argan oil on the face in the morning and then adding tea tree oil at night to the routine on any standout blemishes

4551 2018-04-26 15:13:14 With the possible exception of the late, not great Ralph Klein I bet Alberta premiers hate the oil industry. It’s made Alberta wealthy but seeds political and public dysfunction. 1/2

4553 2018-04-26 15:13:09 It took me a month to discover that blotting excess facial oil is a good tip if you have an oily, acne-prone skin like mine but still wanna use facial oil.

4559 2018-04-26 15:12:32 Google OPEC and what it stands for and what are the countries in that organization that holds the worlds largest oil reserve you wouldn’t be surprise hoe we were at war with a few of them lol
4560 2018-04-26 15:12:20 Yay, let's export oil as gas starts getting expensive again.  Rich get richer, common man gets fucked.

4565 2018-04-26 15:11:58 Oil magnate, Emmanuel Owoicho, has lost his bid to quash the alleged  N102m oil fraud charge brought against him by the EFCC as Justice Affen of an FCT High Court ruled that he had a case to answer. He is to begin his defence, June 28.

4580 2018-04-26 15:10:45 Palm oil conglomerates are clear cutting critical forests.  Not just critical for the survival of orangutans, but for the earth as a whole.  Forests are the lungs of the earth.  No lungs, no air.  Do not support Palm oil products!
4581 2018-04-26 15:10:39 Russian Jewish Canadian @jimcarr_wpg once threatened military action to build oil pipelines in Canada.

4582 2018-04-26 15:10:30 Oil prices have been trending higher over the last week following news that crude inventories dropped so you know what that means. $2.79 per gallon? 
4583 2018-04-26 15:10:22 Fiscal conservatives endorse policies that kill people.  Fiscal conservatives caused the Flint water crisis, fiscal conservatives are ok with the water in Cleveland burning, fiscal conservatives are ok with oil spills. Literally killing people.

4596 2018-04-26 15:09:07 the Dems are holding his feet to the fire and the Reps are asking for favors for their oil company friends and happy that ‘those rules about air and water are relaxed’. That should tell you that our country is f*cked with Pruitt in the EPA.
4597 2018-04-26 15:09:05 @RepMcKinley You should be ashamed of yourself for putting the $$ from mining and oil industry before the health of those paying your salary. Disgusting, people should not die so that corporate america get yet richer.

4611 2018-04-26 15:08:01 The Italians aren’t offering any treatment that will save him. Merely to hook him up to more machines for a limited time. Every doctor who has examined him has reached the same conclusion, that it is inhumane to keep subjecting him to artificial life support.

This is not a solution to the mosquito problem BTW.

4630 2018-04-26 15:06:36 I think people are finally waking up to how important a commodity data is. Big data is the new oil.
4631 2018-04-26 15:06:00 Hi. I wanted to make your lovely recipe but can't find mustard oil, pungent or otherwise. Where do I get it, please?
4632 2018-04-26 15:05:58 Sure but again, I just don't believe the higher-ups expected this group to be among the best in the East in '17-'18. I do think this season, in a sense, was similar to what Edmonton did last yr. The difference being, Maple Leafs have a better roster & more assets to improve it.
4633 2018-04-26 15:05:57 @MichaelCohen212 hey mike, as long as you’re under the bus anyway, make yourself useful and change the oil, ok?

In 2012 it was 112 cause it was running out according to sources 

2017 it’s back down to 70 ish dollars guess it ain’t run out lol
4644 2018-04-26 15:05:10 Was this in your capacity as ONGC director? Looking for sites to dig for oil?
4645 2018-04-26 15:05:07 It's a spout for an oil can!
4646 2018-04-26 15:05:03 My brother, that's the APCs government for you!
They used the crashed oil price as a reason to throw us into recession, now that it has soared we are being asked to prepare for more suffering.
4647 2018-04-26 15:05:03 The ferocity of the greenies and their battle against pipelines vs their seeming acceptance of far riskier oil trains has always baffled me
4648 2018-04-26 15:04:56 Now, it’s GOP Rep. McKinley from West Virginia kissing Pruitt’s ass.  What a surprise that so far oil (Barton) and coal (McKinley) love him.  Thank God for Dems holding this crook’s tiny feet to the fire.
4649 2018-04-26 15:04:52 "Everyone's best interest to have clarity on RINS???" Interesting considering the RIN market is pretty clear despite the bad actors within Big Oil. No more exemptions for Big Oil!  Play by the rules! #RFSWorks

4651 2018-04-26 15:04:15 @JKempEnergy 
So you disagree with capital discipline.
You are not drill-baby-drill either.
Having read your latest report are you really advocating for Big Oil to have a Big Spliff and chill and let the market happen? A little like Donald Sutherland character in Kelly's Heroes?
4652 2018-04-26 15:04:13 Ahh let’s spin some negativity about EV’s....their shares in the oil companies must be suffering so need to do something to increase revenue.....
4653 2018-04-26 15:04:13 Yesterday I got a massage and my girl used an #essential #oil blend for decongestion and she told me I’d be detoxing by way of coughing and sniffling I was like ok sure lol but I’ve been hacking up gross stuff all day today
4654 2018-04-26 15:04:09 They must remove him, however, the Texas , Virginia, and other GOP senators are trying to assist their donors, oil, to keep this horrible EPA administrator in place!

4659 2018-04-26 15:03:59 Dude. I have no registers, no oil in my back up tank AND I’m down a grill. Like what the hell is happening today..
4660 2018-04-26 15:03:55 Your introduction to the CBD oil piece was crappy, Norah. Your biases are showing. CBD oil DOES help. They don't imagine it or "think" that they feel better. SHAME ON YOU! Do some research!
4661 2018-04-26 15:03:42 Never knew it was the job of the EPA director to help promote the oil industry as was just stated on CNN.
4662 2018-04-26 15:03:41 I was dropping my car off for an oil change and as I got there the manager was leaving in an ambulance so I think it’ll go well
4663 2018-04-26 15:03:35 I dont have a blind hatred for Obama so making lies wont work here. The only problem with solar and wind is that it takes money away from the same oil barrons that fund the right-wing media outlets that spoon feed you ideas.

4668 2018-04-26 15:03:16 This is my second day in a row off but I haven’t felt this tired in so long. It’s rough raising puppies along with your own kids. Then i waiting on this oil change. I just want a nap already
4669 2018-04-26 15:03:07 It felt counterintuitive but adding an oil to my skincare routine has cut down on my oily skin tremendously 
4670 2018-04-26 15:03:05 おやすみなさい
4671 2018-04-26 15:03:02 I wish I could be like those people who just use coconut oil, leaves and air for clear skin.

but I guess accutane is fine 
4672 2018-04-26 15:03:00 40 dollar oil change end up being $13,749.33
4673 2018-04-26 15:02:58 David Mc Kindley, W Virginia is praising Pruitt for removing regulations that help protect our air from the oil industry. Is money more important to Kindley than our health??
4674 2018-04-26 15:02:50 Oil is organic..
4675 2018-04-26 15:02:49 Oh, pity the billionaires. The Pruitt hearing reveals that “economic anxiety” was really oil billionaires fretting that they were losing ground to alternative energy.
4676 2018-04-26 15:02:45 Hmm! That ermine-gland oil in my brother was real specific.
4677 2018-04-26 15:02:41 I perpanlly find tissue oils to be quite drying especially on the forever stretching skin, if you do find a suitable oil, do mix it with a rich body lotion
4678 2018-04-26 15:02:38 The guy, like the whole Obama Bro clan, loves to hear himself say stupid shit.
4679 2018-04-26 15:02:32 LEGALIZE CBD OIL
4680 2018-04-26 15:02:28 Manitoba can come as well.... Not much oil and gas but lots of honest farmers and good people
4681 2018-04-26 15:02:26 Amazing isnt it. They champion *Black Rights,* tout Blacks as victims & in the same breath they tell them "Y'all need us to think for you becuz you arent smart enlugh to think for yourselves."  Height of hypocrisy or just the snake oil hard sell to get votes.
4682 2018-04-26 15:02:18 How can they not!
We are all suffering from the government's mismanagement and poor judgement.  Add the greed from the oil and gas sector (gas price)and we all incur fluctuating costs, which we must absorb with our fixed (stagnant) incomes!
4683 2018-04-26 15:02:15 In the short term, maybe. In the long term, Russia will benefit by having aligned itself to America and other major producers of oil. See the UAE and Saudi Arabia connections to Team Trump.
4684 2018-04-26 15:02:13 Bombardier's new planes use a LOT less fuel. They have already substantially cut the emissions from their aircraft. The oil sands can't make the same comparison. Largely because the oil companies lie about their emissions all the time.
4685 2018-04-26 15:02:01 @RepMcKinley accepted $172,500 from the mining industry and $77,350 from the Oil & Gas industry...he also sides with @EPAScottPruitt #TheSwamp #VoteHimOut #RepublicansWithoutBalls
4686 2018-04-26 15:01:59 Scott Pruitt knows way more about prices in oil markets than an EPA administrator should.
4687 2018-04-26 15:01:47 The government of Dominica has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Kourtney Kardashian in a dowlas wig.
4688 2018-04-26 15:01:44 Democratic Rep to @EPAScottPruitt: why are you undermining protections for children against asthma?

4720 2018-04-26 14:59:46 Yes, it can be paired with our CBD Oil.

Our CBD Roll On you apply topically to your skin. We generally recommend applying it to your neck and chest are but you can also apply it directly to a targeted area, i.e. hand, foot, leg, etc. 

It all depends on what your goals are.

4770 2018-04-26 14:56:09 Yep. Most new refineries in Asia and India (where the demand is) are designed for heavy crude.

The global market needs crude, not refined products.

Note: Some oil traders are calling for a new oil shock into triple digits as reduced capital investment constrains supply.
4771 2018-04-26 14:56:04 It's a protest by the oil companies over pipelines. Gas prices are the same price as when oil was at $140/barrel. The prices will continue to increase until the pipelines are built.

4781 2018-04-26 14:55:07 So, the Islamophobic Pompeo does not mind taking their oil money. He has been taking Koch money since he was a pup and his mirror image? Tom Cotton. The notion Pompeo comes to negotiate when he truly want to obliterate is ludicrous. War is what they worship. It means money

4785 2018-04-26 14:54:49 Ojukwu seceded because he wanted control of oil. Biafra war had nothing to do with tribalism, it was just easier to sell the war that way. It was about control of oil. Get your facts right, stop deceiving yourself.
4786 2018-04-26 14:54:46 #OOTT - #Forex | Crude oil prices this week reached highs since – again – late 2014. At the very least, this will support headline inflation rates around the world. @Westpac #WTI #Brent $CL_F $DXY
4787 2018-04-26 14:54:43 What a disgusting person Rep. Barton from Texas is! To him, and his oil company donors no doubt, Pruitt is an absolute saint doing a lot of good by undoing awful Obama Adm. clean air regulations.  Texas air must be ripe with pride this morning, and every day he serves.

4791 2018-04-26 14:54:07 Today's Euro breakdown is causing large pain to oversized long euro positions. In this sort of a forced fund liquidation, other markets get dragged down with it. My best guess is Oil, bonds and other commodities. Watch out for sharp unexpected moves everywhere

4795 2018-04-26 14:53:56 Who is persisting in burning more oil?  Our cars are getting more and more efficient!  Gasoline is a small percentage of oil consumption, ready to give up everything made with oil?  What we don't produce here gets produced elsewhere, smarter to produce our own locally.
4796 2018-04-26 14:53:52 It's 8 eggs, almond flour, baking powder and oil

4817 2018-04-26 14:52:14 The rise in US bond yields coupled with surge in oil prices continue to weigh on domestic gilt prices. 10y yield ended at 7.76% vs. yesterday’s close of 7.74%.
4818 2018-04-26 14:52:08 the unspoken secret is that most of them in Spain are offline to Google, as they are toed trailers that show up at weekends on street corners. And here's the thing: they empty their vat of oil and use a fresh fill and charge maybe a euro for a carrier bag of Churros  #churros
4819 2018-04-26 14:51:59 I know I just started yesterday with oil, but this roll-on thing, is it a product used in stead of or as a compliment to the oil drops?

4828 2018-04-26 14:51:29 Why? I mean, we export our oil out for big bucks and then import oil in and pass the tax on it to us consumers. 30 years of oil reserves, yet here we are at $3+ gas prices!

4842 2018-04-26 14:50:20 .@RepJoeBarton tells @EPAScottPruitt that he's a victim of "Washington politics" and provides a welcome respite for Pruitt at this hearing. Barton is a longtime ally of oil/gas industry who has questioned mainstream climate science conclusions.
4843 2018-04-26 14:50:19 #EPA Barton of Texas real #Pruitt ass kisser. Maybe something to do with protecting oil interests I'm guessing.
4844 2018-04-26 14:50:13 Oil production in Canada is at record high levels.

What are you talking about?
4845 2018-04-26 14:50:03 Just remember, the same people who find @JoyAnnReid 's tales of time traveling espionage completely within the bounds of acceptable science are the same people who believe the coasts are soon to be swallowed by the sea if we don't stop using oil and natural gas.
4846 2018-04-26 14:49:58 She is actually trading oil and made $24 000 in one day.
4847 2018-04-26 14:49:57 @RepJoeBarton is calling @EPAScottPruitt a "victim of Washington politics" yet @RepJoeBarton took $209,250 from the Oil & Gas industry. Hmm wonder why he sides with the current @EPA #SwampThing
4848 2018-04-26 14:49:57 #BootPruitt: Corrupt. Working against the very mission of his agency (environmental protection). Working for the oil/gas/coal industry. He's the opposite of a public servant.

4859 2018-04-26 14:48:54 Super late to the party, but sometimes if you fall in that awkward gap it's easier to find a youtube tutorial on how to change the oil for your model (some folks like showing off their old car skills) and get the parts yourself. I believe in you!
4860 2018-04-26 14:48:49 I was in 1989 Poland, seeing long lines and a lot of clothes in a department store all of the same color of maroon, with @fiat Polskis on the road.

4863 2018-04-26 14:48:19 Many people with ASD are using CBD oil for inflammation and anxiety. It also really helps my SLE (Lupus) inflammation and pain.
4864 2018-04-26 14:48:18 I also heard that people in the Middle Ages poured boiling oil on their opponents during sieges. But Jeremy Corbyn never condemned this practice either - he was very quiet about it (ok he hadn't been born, but my point stands)
4865 2018-04-26 14:48:04 makes you want to get out the oil paints and canvas.
4866 2018-04-26 14:47:59 A series of oil spills. Around 2-3% of it is actually natural as there are some fissures off the coast of SBA and SD that emit the oil. Though for every 3 natural oil slicks on the ocean surface theres 100 slicks from oil spills offshore. Not good for the wildlife.
4867 2018-04-26 14:47:59 Ug and this Mr Barton from my state of Texas is a joke. Softball bullshit questions from another guy on the take from oil companies

4875 2018-04-26 14:47:04 I'm getting my oil changed, sitting in the waiting area rn... sometimes i just listen to people.. it's amazing how wildly different everyone thinks lol

4877 2018-04-26 14:46:54 @glennbeck has a guest saying we're about to export oil. If true then why are gas prices rising for the Summer?
We are being exploited by fuel co.s in collusion w/1 another in illegal price fixing!

4886 2018-04-26 14:46:18 You can  also make a scrub by mixing one  teaspoon of granulated  sugar, one  teaspoon of honey, and one-half  teaspoon of almond oil. Use  it to scrub  your lips once a week.

4889 2018-04-26 14:45:54 Francisco Monaldi on #oilproduction in #Venezuela: Today more than 60% of production is in the hand of joint ventures and more than 2/3 is in extra heavy oil from Orinoco, which requires imports to process.
4890 2018-04-26 14:45:48 Have you tried peppermint oil?
4891 2018-04-26 14:45:47 yes! I’ve only used it maybe 3 times cause I was like this can’t be the problem everyone else has such good results.. but it is lol I use coconut oil too and pure vitamin E Oil

4893 2018-04-26 14:45:28 Cut 50% $LUV bought last week with $3 loss.  Expected oil price to fall to push up the sector.
4894 2018-04-26 14:45:24 My cat always steps in her poop so I just put peppermint oil under her paws.
4895 2018-04-26 14:45:24 Pruitt dismissed concerns as political moves to stop 45's agenda. If 45's agenda is to cater to oil and gas industry and environment destroying deregulation, then YES, his agenda should be stopped. He forgets that the P in EPA stands for PROTECTION.

4917 2018-04-26 14:43:16 60 eggs, maize meal, salt and cooking oil
4918 2018-04-26 14:43:15 Just like Saskatchewan gladly had its hand out until the oil and commodity boom of the past 15 years, less the past 5...then they complained as Alberta is....Now they're sticking their hand out quietly again.

4920 2018-04-26 14:42:47 As bad as the #nuclear risk is the fact that this planned #Rosatom fleet of floating reactors and servicing nuclear icebreakers is to power new oil, gas and coal exploitation in the Arctic. The Akademik Lomonosov will power coal mines.
4921 2018-04-26 14:42:43 Now we are cookin w peanut oil . But who is client number 3?
4922 2018-04-26 14:42:38 The Country is rich from oil but  most of them are Cavemen still ..as in never got educated properly coz they think they don't need education coz they have lots of money..that the world is their slave..
4923 2018-04-26 14:42:35 I just added like a tablespoon of coconut oil to my usual almond milk coffee and wow it really changes things
4924 2018-04-26 14:42:33 ROFL. Talk about embarrassing. OPEC shipping more oil would LOWER prices.

Sheesh, trolls sure have declined in quality.  You were hatched 2 months ago and haven't even gotten your name right.
4925 2018-04-26 14:42:31 Francisco Monaldi: In 1990s, Chavez benefited from new added production coming from projects started by foreign partners, but he extracted profits instead of investing. When oil prices collapsed in 2014, #Venezuela was already in arrears with their partners. @kennaninstitute

4927 2018-04-26 14:42:21 John Barry, former board member of Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority, East, said he supports oil revenue sharing for Gulf states, but said the oil & gas industry should pay more for restoration: The industry cannot expect taxpayers to pick up their tab. #wetlands
4928 2018-04-26 14:42:14 Another solid contribution to America courtesy of DT. At this point, the next person in line to run the EPA will be a fracking unit or maybe a capsized oil tanker...
4929 2018-04-26 14:41:25 Oil prices are projected to hit triple digits per barrel soon, which will have a huge negative impact on all Canadians from a cost of living perspective, but you keep on pushing for this form of old non-renewable energy.  Get with the times Andy, oil is so 2000 and late.
4930 2018-04-26 14:41:19 I put leave in conditioner and Moroccan oil in it last night and work up and my hair didn’t even look greasy its so dry lol

4932 2018-04-26 14:41:02 They basically undermined their own capitalist system.  If I have a business and I make shady deals or risky moves and my business tanks nobody bails me out.  Every business should be allowed to die if it is it’s time to go. Especially oil and coal!  FFS!
4933 2018-04-26 14:41:00 -rl sorry oot, habis pake oil trs bbrp menit kemudian boleh pake aloe gel the saem gak? apa bagaimana enaknya?

4955 2018-04-26 14:39:04 BREAKING: The HSE has written to all oil and gas operators expressing concern about the number of gas release. The regulator says some have come "perilously close to disaster"  and that more needs to be done to tackle them.

4959 2018-04-26 14:38:44 That’s my point. Do better than him (not to pin all this on Hainsey, that’s not quite fair), and you’re likely onto the 2nd round.
4960 2018-04-26 14:38:19 @MichaelAvenatti you are right. @JohnBerman & snooty press dismiss you & @StormyDaniels. Treat you like a "Saul",  slick suit wearing, media craving, stripper defender. Not worthy of serious consideration. Yet, that's Presidents attorney, #Cohen. He's the snake oil seller.
4961 2018-04-26 14:38:19 Yes. Precisely this, needs to be in the right thing. I'm a fan of avacado oil.

4968 2018-04-26 14:37:12 I roast slices of cauli w/olive oil, sea salt and turn half way through when they’re nice and golden. Top with a bit of Parmesan for the last ten minutes.
4969 2018-04-26 14:37:02 Sorry Jocky, yes, understand that, which is why I said SNP. Sad division is caused in  EU distribution of UK rebate & SNP have not accepted, UK REF vote of all the ppl of Scotland. EU always takes most & gives back less & will want control of Scotland's oil.
4970 2018-04-26 14:36:57 The guy doing my oil change is so cute
4971 2018-04-26 14:36:45 You have to be very selective for what to use coconut oil with. We have about 12 different types of oil at any one time

4981 2018-04-26 14:35:41 I just heard on Bloomberg that next year the US may be the largest oil exporter in the world, larger than even Saudi Arabia.  BIG MISTAKE, we never seem to learn our lesson, I remember the oil embargos.  We were helpless.  US oil should be reserved for the American people.
4982 2018-04-26 14:35:32 How much it costs when you ignore basic Car care? Car maintenance like engine oil change can save money when done on time. Download CARIDO App now and book a Engine Oil service, our mechanics come to you whether home or office.
4983 2018-04-26 14:35:32 I leave mine on the counter for an hour or so with olive oil on both sides, bit of garlic, salt +/- lemon pepper sprinkled on, then onto bbq. The oil keeps the meat from sticking but also gives the seasoning something to adhere with.
4984 2018-04-26 14:35:31 US foreign policy is perfect for the Russian economy.  Sanctions against Russia are useless if the oil price is high, and the US  is doing its best to push the price higher.

4992 2018-04-26 14:35:09 @BettyMcCollum04 Please ask @EPAScottPruitt why he has taken more meetings with oil and gas execs than he has with environmental and public health groups. Isn't the EPA's primary mission to protect our environment and health? Please dismiss him from office!
4993 2018-04-26 14:34:59 I don´t think he will do much because Russia now has Storage facilities for Gas and Oil in Germany. But, he could squeeze them terrible if he wanted to. They are lucky that the Winter is all but over....for sure!

5024 2018-04-26 14:31:40 Hainsey was a band aid solution that should've been signed to a 1 yr deal, much like the Oilers did w/ Russell the 1st time around. By no means was he brought in to be a piece to put them over the top. Rather one to help them along the development path.

5029 2018-04-26 14:31:14 I think it's more about the qualifications of his nominees. The vetting that should be taking place is taking place. His picks, the doctor, the oil executive, the lego film producer, the tv talking box, the fixer have all proven to be just as idiotic as he is.

5032 2018-04-26 14:30:57 Tom Delonge (formerly of Blink 182) is now an alien researcher! He was able to raise 2.5 million dollars to form co. called "To The Stars". Seems that he has connections& his father was an oil co. executive. Will be researching "Advanced Aerial Threats". WHY?  Qualifications?
5033 2018-04-26 14:30:57 There you have it! Hemp is one of the most ecologically efficient (least destructive?) plants to grow. Now we just have to convince the Oil & Gas industry not to lobby against the idea. (For those who don’t know, plastic is a petroleum byproduct). Maybe McDonald’s has the clout

5036 2018-04-26 14:30:39 IF you havent already read the McCrone report , and realised it wasnt about oil but about Scotland being an economic threat even without it , then you should asap , it predicts imo this removal of devolved powers to prevent it being a success EVEN within the union itself.
5037 2018-04-26 14:30:32 As a chronic pain sufferer, I can say that the ointment with CBD oil is the only non-prescription product that evens touches my pain. It should be studied and it should be sold as an over the counter item.

5039 2018-04-26 14:30:30 The big deal for me on all of this ended up being 1) thin spread, 2) high heat and 3) small batches. Always ended up preferring square chopped baked in the oven over any other type except for the peculiar high heat/cheap oil/lots of salt/ bag shred done en-masse at a diner.

5049 2018-04-26 14:29:37 it was always about $$$ and greed...those right wing oil people should be made to live at the oil sands...

5051 2018-04-26 14:29:18 I need new tires, an oil change and a new key fob battery. Can I just throw the whole car away and get a new one now?

5059 2018-04-26 14:28:22 little to no oil, but I wouldn’t say you get the same crispiness. It’s like a few steps above baked but not as crispy/good as fried. It’s also not greasy so that’s a plus.
5060 2018-04-26 14:28:14 Spark their interest with this economical unit. 58k miles free oil change for the life of the lease!!!!

It is about to hit the FAN!
U.S. car manufacturers are in an agreement with

Only building SUV& TRUCKS?

5070 2018-04-26 14:27:37 Venezuela and Maduro are trying to use the relationship with Russia in 3 different ways: 1) to counteract/counterbalance US influence, 2) as ally in case of oil sanctions, 3) partner in effort to bypass current sanctions, says @penfold_michael @kennaninstitute #WilsonSmart
5071 2018-04-26 14:27:37 This is what happens when the people of USA & Canada allow judges to run their countries. North Americans still don’t understand we need oil to live for many years yet,clothes,tires,      medical,surgery,etc,etc.Pipelines are still the safest,get real,wake the hell up.
5072 2018-04-26 14:27:34 No mean that they are protecting the interest of Russia which is the oil there

5093 2018-04-26 14:25:17 When I worked in the kitchen, I would have had a knife thrown at my head if I'd tried to shred potatoes for hashbrowns

The square ones (which can be chopped in your kitchen) are actually way easier to *bake*, at about 425F tossed in oil, salt and herbs

5107 2018-04-26 14:23:31 You are going off the point to win to prove something. My assertion was that attack on Muslims was not based on Budhism as a teaching method. The politics of oil in that region and political reasons have more to do with it
5108 2018-04-26 14:23:23 Calm before the storm.  Raining oil soon

5126 2018-04-26 14:21:26 Olive oil is lighter than water so why put it in your pasta pot while boiling? It doesn't stop the pasta from sticking together; the rapid boiling and constant stirring does. Don't waste your olive oil,!!

Jupiter has a preference for people with hairy toenails. Staple a block of jelly to your nipples and pretend you own an oil refinery. This will ensure your intestines are filled with yoghurt.
5132 2018-04-26 14:21:07 The bagged versions are usually parboiled, so they're easier to cook. Basically just a matter of enough oil/butter and a nice hot pan (3-4 mark on a regular electric stove and I always preferred cast iron) with an even, thin spread. Not to much in the pan

5147 2018-04-26 14:19:27 Sen. Landrieu in her opening statement @NatResources highlights CA imports lots of oil.  Actually they import 56% of their oil from foreign sources.
5148 2018-04-26 14:19:26 it is one of the reasons not the only. even in 2013 if we take a parameter like barrels/unit GDP it wouldve been way lower than say 2003. fuel as a basket is falling as we grow. so yes it wasnt caused by oil shock but pent up burdens across sectors. infra,oil primary to it.

5182 2018-04-26 14:16:26 This seems.....odd. I guess the thinking is trucks and SUVs will never go out of style. This means gas and oil need to remain cheap or Ford is dead.

5197 2018-04-26 14:14:54 I love the vibrant yellow fields of  rapeseed at the moment, always a sure sign Spring should be with us!
I haven't used Olive Oil for some time and love the fact we sell both Yorkshire and Cheshire Rapeseed Oil....supporting local and reducing our food miles dramatically!
5198 2018-04-26 14:14:37 v.interesting - at work atm on 'disputes' as they are represented and appear (usually in the form of strikes and sabotage) throughout world oil fiction - following Mitchell's Carbon Democracy as a marker of difference in this context between coal and oil.....anyways.....

5202 2018-04-26 14:13:53 2013 wasnt per se caused by oil shock ( prices were high for prior 2-3 years)...reserves are much better and our deficit even with high oil wont reach 4.5%+ which we saw for awhile in 12.....IMO crisis seems unlikely now unless there is some spectacular implosion in world economy
5203 2018-04-26 14:13:46 + oil +  rocket factory 
@katiadmi We haven’t met, but I sat in your old desk for a couple of days during a biz trip. Hi!
5204 2018-04-26 14:13:34 I put lemongrass oil in my oil diffuser and I don’t think I’ll need to splurge on candles anymore. It smells soooo good in my apartment.
5205 2018-04-26 14:13:30 I just googled “gutter oil” after a tip off. Street vendors and cheap restaurants there use oil and other stuff from sewers to cook in. Nauseating videos on YouTube about it.

5213 2018-04-26 14:12:53 Thats just crap. Canadian oil is the dirtiest on the planet and you Andrew must keep on spewing more of same 'll Crappy crap. Canadian dirty is unsustainable, the pipe dosen't bring many jobs and KM is American meaning all the profit leaves this country.
5214 2018-04-26 14:12:51 Can someone tell me if it’s ok to apply oil on face daily? Or should i do it only 2-3 times a week. Skin care is hard

5219 2018-04-26 14:11:43 Why would the US need to send global bankers working with the UN, billions of our dollars so that they can lent it to global corporations to drill for oil and natual has in Africa and Asia? Because that is what the Paris Accord is all about.

5223 2018-04-26 14:10:59 What about horrific side effects from drugs like Lyrica used to treat fibromyalgia and nerve pain?  The side effects are a mile long.

5272 2018-04-26 14:05:09 I prefer the taste of UK chocolate. Perhaps it's that it nearly always has vegetable oil that apparently is forbidden in the US. I tried Hersheys once, it made me reach.

5275 2018-04-26 14:04:54 Your right. The reason NDP won a majority in AB because oil prices dropped = work stopped & the continued corruption of the Conservative members.  Yikes my prov is forgetful  #AB #PnPCBC #cdnpoli #ableg
5276 2018-04-26 14:04:43 I’m not a fan of the wall but I see a possibility for a huge renewable energy project that could end the need for foreign oil imports in America & create millions of jobs. We would still need oil, but American & Canadian oil. We could take care of ourselves & sell power to Mexico

5278 2018-04-26 14:04:42 Canadian energy is not just oil. We are actually lagging behind other countries when it comes to developing renewable generation and energy storage.

5299 2018-04-26 14:02:25 What they are trying to change in the constitution will mean that we have no legal defence against illicit use expropriation of land. Venezuela collapsed because their use socialist policies and dependence on the oil industry was economically unsustainable.

With oil under the Shah, or the IR, Iran should've found it easy to develop, overtake Turkey & Egypt, and lead the Islamic world for a while. I don't think it would stop Islamabad in the end, it doesn't doubt itself

5329 2018-04-26 13:58:45 Not always. Think of the Standard Oil or ATT breakup. Sometimes big should be forcefully busted up. This may be one of those times.

5331 2018-04-26 13:58:21 We get it, you want kids down the coal mines, big giant open cast mines, oil spills and gas leaks all over the place and fracking causing environmental disasters, because you hate green politics.
5332 2018-04-26 13:58:14 Norway is part of EEA, EFTA and schengen. Again, effectively member of single market and allows freedom of movement. Also pays into EU but has no say on rules. All options which have been rejected by Leavers and govmnt.
Also Norway economy hugely different to ours eg. Oil and gas
5333 2018-04-26 13:58:10 That PPI-#inflation improvement has already been completely negated in April due to the #ANC-government's increase in the fuel levy and the hike in oil prices.

5336 2018-04-26 13:58:01 Your pores open when you sweat and the sweat and oil from our hair gets into the pores and we wipe out face with a dry towel which closes the pores and traps the dirt and oil in them. Before you wash use a hot towel laying on your skin to open your pores back up and then 2/

5338 2018-04-26 13:57:57 You won’t get high. However, the first 2 or 3 times you’ll get pretty tired. Once thats over its like MAGIC. Nothing came close to touching my anxiety but CBD oil helped 100%.
5339 2018-04-26 13:57:38 So are you a Dr that examined the boy? You know this how? If this was your child would you be so easy to give up? I would go to the ends of the earth to try and save my child. Read about Lorenzo’s Oil. Those parents found a cure themselves when Drs said “no hope”
5340 2018-04-26 13:57:27 That doesn’t mean there may not be a place for things like some training in a glycogen depleted state. But what LCHF is selling isn’t that. They are selling snake oil.
5341 2018-04-26 13:57:13 $AFE better find the mother-load of all oil deposits or the Insiders with a lot of skin in the game are going to be holding a very large bag here
5342 2018-04-26 13:57:12 Radical and at the same time very dangerous. We’re in a tailspin. Oil going up. Gas prices going up even more with taxes. What will the poor Ontario types do loosing their homes. Building boom is toast. Kaput. Finito.

5365 2018-04-26 13:54:25 Hmm you might want to introduce db structure. On the Buchard oil spill we used a db to generate our forms and collect data using volunteers + staff. It made data entry much easier. I think these principles are best taught with bad examples. I.e. show the impact of bad spreadsheet

5377 2018-04-26 13:52:45 Also, just as BC heads to court seeking jurisdiction over oil transport, the Trudeau government seeks to blunt the province’s arguments about science gaps with a new report, released just hours before we see the reference case, saying those gaps are closing.

I drink a mix of apple cider vinegar, hemp oil and tumeric in water multiple times per day. If possible, green tea.
5411 2018-04-26 13:48:44 CBD oil is all medicine without the THC high. It's so safe there allowed to use it in the pet medicine industry which is a 6 billion dollar sector. HMPQ is worldwide CBD oil.

5473 2018-04-26 13:41:29 $AAL anybody buying an airplane and not thinking oil was going to have an impact is insane, but this big of an impact on a cheap stock???
5474 2018-04-26 13:41:27 Con la Ley Taft el gobierno de estados unidos rompio los monopolios Standard Oil, American Tobacco, ITT, etc pero hoy que Facebook controla 2 billones de cuentas y vende informacion al mejor postor de sus usuarios, lo  consienten los politico$ en vez de fragmentrar el monopolio
5475 2018-04-26 13:41:17 Yea he was getting warranty work done on a small oil leak but he was told the part at present cannot be sourced from LEVC
5476 2018-04-26 13:41:15 So you're basically saying that a black millionaire was stupid and fell for the snake oil. Not racist at all.
5477 2018-04-26 13:41:14 After the implementation of daily computation of fuel prices, there has been constant hike in fuel prices which clearly suggests that there is some thing secrete deal between government and oil companies.

5480 2018-04-26 13:41:09 guess Bette is Okay with Liberals like Soros and Steyer who made billions. Soros got his start as a Nazi collaborator stealing form fellow Jews. Steyer made billions on Oil etc .
5481 2018-04-26 13:41:02 It would be so nice, if some cutscenes (e.g. Studiopolis - Flying Battery, Flying Battery - Press Garden, Oil Ocean - Lava Reef) had Act 2 music playing as do Green Hill - Chemical Plant and Press Garden - Stardust Speedway transitions.
Also, custom sprites in GHZ - CPZ cutscene.

Less treatment for waste H2O
Less protection from air pollution

Less consumer protection esp. from big banks

Which pollution is more damaging to our children & grandchildren?

5510 2018-04-26 13:38:13 Environmental Club- producing plastics has a detrimental effect on the environment. Plastic is a petroleum product. The oil drilling and the processing into plastic releases harmful emissions, increasing our current plight with climate change. It is up to you to change the world.
5511 2018-04-26 13:38:04 Its all about the oil ...

5514 2018-04-26 13:37:49 Oh no. Don’t downplay the truth and “ caught red handed “. It’s a Soros Marxist tactic. Using government and private funds to hire activists to create division and despair. Alberta is in huge despair. Trudeau just spat on Alberta and Sask. Just like his papa. Middle finger to Oil
5515 2018-04-26 13:37:49 extra virgin olive oil is about the only weapon in my skin care arsenal
5516 2018-04-26 13:37:42 Right, but you called it cannabis oil. The fact you use both cannabis and hemp oil as separate products shows you understand the difference.

5522 2018-04-26 13:37:01 permian production is so high we can have record exports, during less imports and external production cuts and still have growing inventory
the media (so tired of that but its true with oil) is over hyping trump tweets and it would be nice to see these markets not run by bad algo
5523 2018-04-26 13:36:51 There goes the jobs. Next oil hike people stop buying trucks. Hows the global channels compete, they buy cars?

5538 2018-04-26 13:35:26 my mentions blew the hell up from getting mad at that essential oil moron last night
5539 2018-04-26 13:35:25 I think instead of admitting that isn't how the world works, they'd rather blame someone, but really. Putting economic hopes on oil and coal? Reintroducing trickle down economics? Placing unreasonable tariffs and blocking migrant workers? They were fine with all this

5542 2018-04-26 13:35:20 How much less do we get? Why does Saskatchewan oil trade for less? It’s a complex market I guess. The Crown (citizens of Canada) own the oil reserves. We have a right to set a price in royalties and taxes for it. Abandoned wells suggest we need the income.

5546 2018-04-26 13:34:54 This shows equalisation payments to provinces from the federal government.  How much is from Alberta's oil industry?  It's not 2 Billion.

5550 2018-04-26 13:34:38 Palmers lotion, once in the morning and before bed. Also get bio oil and put it on during the day. When I was pregnant I only ended up with stretch marks on my hips 
5551 2018-04-26 13:34:34 Yeah, mostly we use olive oil. Or safflower for high heat. She uses the coconut oil in baking mostly, cookies,brownies,etc. It's not overpowering but to me it really upends the flavor enough (in a negative way).  I don't mind it when spicy so much like coconut curry.
5552 2018-04-26 13:34:20 As a side note @EdVanDerWalt, now that you have removed white sugar from your diet, chapeau, I suggest adding extra high quality fats. My favourite, a high grade coconut oil to coffee (black, always black) and ensure snacks include items such as nuts and avocados. Life.

5560 2018-04-26 13:32:55 All about the development wheel and not rushing into decisions before they need to be made...unless an offer comes along that is to good to pass up on. If you move a young core piece, the return had better solve the roster's actual shortcoming. Window dressing isn't good enough.
5561 2018-04-26 13:32:50 Kale is really good. Baked kale chips, with some olive oil and sea salt. That's good stuff right there.

5563 2018-04-26 13:32:21 He wanted to steal that money, just like the oil in Iraq. Being a good business man (and oh, is he so good at business, believe him) in his mind means stealing and lying at every turn.

5576 2018-04-26 13:30:43 Right. Hemp oil.  Hemp oil is from hemp. It's not cannabis (marijauana) oil

both are from c. Sativa
But both are very different in function. 

Hemp oil. Not a drug. Not cannabis. So useless it give you acid reflux. 

Cannabis oil. A drug. Don't drive on it.

Inspection, new wiper blades (that I needed to pass said inspection), and an oil change later,that’s $70dollars I didn’t intend on spending today. Looks like I’m on a meal plan of ramen and diet water for a while -.-
5584 2018-04-26 13:29:52 The Syrian People: are they affected by bombs or climate change, or is it the same effect? All this devastation could have been prevented if the West had invested, with a conscience, in renewable energy as per @PMOIndia & China @XHNews instead of oil & gas wars.

5591 2018-04-26 13:29:11 Yes, yes we are. I suggest it is because people in the oil industry know it is unsustainable and damaging to the planet. The only way they can cope with the cognitive dissonance is to play the victim.
5592 2018-04-26 13:29:09 Dab some peppermint oil on your clit during doggy is a great view of your gorgeous bod. Raising your legs spread?
5593 2018-04-26 13:29:05 I prefer olive oil over coconut oil. Olive oil has a buttery taste to me. This is more like a preference I am sure. I have tried to sauté in coconut oil before. The whole dish just tasted  like coconut to me. Which is not what I wanted at all. Some people aren't as sensitive.
5594 2018-04-26 13:28:44 And that's where the energy should be directed. Funny tho that as long as they have oil, the West does fark all about them.
5595 2018-04-26 13:28:36 Where was the doubt. The bombings are to disrupt the Iran-Syria-Europe oil pipeline.

5605 2018-04-26 13:27:09 Not lazy. Just comes down to Russia/KSA desires and what happens to VZ/Iran. Shale will more than offset any declines. Your thesis hinges on what ROPEC decides to do. I don’t think they want $100 oil. It will destroy demand
5606 2018-04-26 13:27:08 I love SA and I love Africa you just cant get over the fact that klopp kicked Pep out of champions league 10m barrels of oil a day couldn't help you at anfield

5609 2018-04-26 13:26:29 i got on at southern, a woman was pouring cooking oil all over the train tracks and herself. got on the train and said "lets light this bitch up" and each station, she poured oil on herself and out the train. metro transit rode two stops with her and GOT OFF THE TRAIN.
5610 2018-04-26 13:26:27 Sorry if you do t like it and makes you feel little annoyed but that’s the reality.

5611 2018-04-26 13:26:15 Have you ever attended a TR event or read any of his materials? Have you ever met a snake oil sales person? I'm guessing that the answer is "no."

Are you qualified to make that comparison?

5616 2018-04-26 13:25:45 Yeah, the dream of Mexicans trying to escape their shithole country.  Yeah, I said shithole.  A country with main cash inflows of: remittances; tourism; oil exports and drug money.
5617 2018-04-26 13:25:45 Not a surprise since so much of this nightmare has to do with Putin's desire to drill for oil in the Arctic Circle.
5618 2018-04-26 13:25:44 I see my doc at 8am to discuss Virginia CBD-THCA oil. Won’t get any. Apparently I’m not dying enough. Cannabis works so I don’t care. I have a good attorney.
5619 2018-04-26 13:24:50 In my youth, my scholarship focused on franchising. See Chisum, State Regulation of Franchising, 48 Wash. L. Rev. 291 (1973). Then I “switched” to patent law.  Turns out that was not a switch all!! See Justice Thomas in Oil States: a patent is a “public franchise.”

5659 2018-04-26 13:19:39 Oh yeah. I've also added tea tree oil. Now I can't remember if I tried soap of some kind or not. It just sounds awful, anything besides saline. The tto was like snorting wasabi. Do not recommend.

5719 2018-04-26 13:11:56 The thing is, it’s not like you can simply boycott oil unless you go off the grid. Our transportation, food, healthcare, everything depends on energy, and much of that depends on fossil fuels.

5724 2018-04-26 13:11:34 Brush liquid coconut oil in your hair and leave it in for ~2 hours (longer better) and use shampoo to remove. Do that like 2-3 times a week.

Only use conditioner otherwise. Shampoo removes all oils, good and bad. Your natural oils in your hair are really good for growth. Gl!
5725 2018-04-26 13:11:30 But CBD Oil is Cannabis Oil, so your point, was incorrect. CBD can be derived from both Marijuana and Hemp, both Cannabis. Hemp CBD Oil will have less than 0.3% THC, Marijuana CBD products will have any amount higher such as 1:1 ratios etc.
5726 2018-04-26 13:11:26 I was talking about the Maple Leafs. Pretty sure I don’t need to qualify everything I say about another team with “well, I should really talk, because the Oilers”, etc.

5818 2018-04-26 12:59:59 Beauty tip: never use coconut oil as your natural moisturizer. It’s too heavy to get into your skin and just sits on the surface. But you can definitely use it as a cleansing oil to remove makeup! Works like a charm and leaves your skin soft!

5854 2018-04-26 12:56:39 Olive oil is made through a processing of pressing olives. This oil is highly priced compared to other oils.

If you're feeling like you're pressed and under pressure from every side, imagine your value at the end of the process when you are now an extra-virgin olive oil.

(OK you dont deserve so much pain, sorry but...)... he's just doing in France the reverse of what he pretends to want : on palm oil, fossile energy, clean transports. Never involving ecology into politics in fact!

5880 2018-04-26 12:53:53 I agree' we have known since the 70s we are heading for gridlock and nothing was done with all the oil money. Gas/Electricity private and all profits taken out the country. We are heading for power cuts  within the next 5 years and they have not even told the people yet.
5881 2018-04-26 12:53:47 1 star analyst with average return rated of -.04%? That's an expert? Ha!

I think the major upside catalysts are if the whole share bb goes through and oil continues to climb to partially offset terrible hedging

Take care of yourself :)
5886 2018-04-26 12:53:02 BP want to create an environment of scarcity to keep prices high, others disagree. Known reserves increase every year, in other words, every we have more known oil to extract than the year before. I notice they don’t mention methane hydrates- 1000’s of years!
5887 2018-04-26 12:52:36 1. Since it's been Indonesia that had apparently needed the EU more than the latter had needed the former, I can understand our first reason for securing the EU market for Indonesian palm oil. However, the less-reasonable second reason is quite hard to grasp.

5993 2018-04-26 12:37:39 Apply this granulated sugar and essential oil spot treatment for one night and watch: your dry skin and dead skin cells will disappear like magic!
5994 2018-04-26 12:37:35 Make salad dressing! Mix 3 parts flaxseed oil with 1 part lime juice and 1 part tahini. Add blue cheese crumbles and molasses to taste.
5995 2018-04-26 12:37:27 It’s gonna be nice today, gotta oil this beard up
5996 2018-04-26 12:37:17 $CL_F has an incomplete 5 swings sequence from 2/9 low and calls for more upside. We should be in 6th swing right now #Elliottwave #Oil
5997 2018-04-26 12:37:16 everywhere, oil is not even just about the black stuff, it is also about land, environment, politics, banking etc
5998 2018-04-26 12:37:02 This must be the fastest oil change I’ve ever gotten from a dealership. @PackeyWebb is the best!
5999 2018-04-26 12:36:50 it most likely contains too much alcohol;  plain fresh high-quality olive oil (or almond, avocado, etc), a few drops on a damp wattenschijf, works very well.

6001 2018-04-26 12:36:45 Most (all?) CBD oil is extracted from hemp, but your article repeatedly identifies it as coming from marijuana. What gives?
6002 2018-04-26 12:36:33 but what is this issues of oil and gas? the whole promo sounds like a govt thing! For sure media can tell us what is it we will be looking into
6003 2018-04-26 12:36:24 That's just oxidation of the frets. Wiping you fretboard down with something like lemon oil before storing it should reduce its occurrence.
6004 2018-04-26 12:35:58 es support 2639.5 , 2635.50 and 2611.25 and then 2600 even if we break 2600 bye bye market.. I am still bullish here today. OIL looks toppy because stocks might have room to run so move out of oil and into stocks, Gold selling off, sell gold, lumber rallying.. I am still short
6005 2018-04-26 12:35:44 even after frying a lot of fish i'm still scared every time fish lets out it's juices that reacts with the oil and you know... oh god it hurts

6280 2018-04-26 12:02:42 Everyone needs to read this. No matter what they say about safety, accidents still do happen. Going across the Straits of Mackinaw, either above ground or below ground is bad science. One leak could comtaminate the Great Lakes forever. Oil and water do not mix.
6281 2018-04-26 12:02:39 Romanesco. One of my favorite veggies. Chop it up, olive oil, salt, pepper, bake until brown. So good.
6282 2018-04-26 12:02:37 But when you cook fish at high heat the oil remains intact? That never made sense to me.
6283 2018-04-26 12:02:32 RT BFMradio: RT NewsBFM: Pakatan Harapan pledged to give half of all taxes collected in Sarawak, & 20% of oil royalties to the state govt if it wins in #GE14. This is reportedly part of a new deal the Opposition is offering, to grant greater autonomy in education, healthcare…
6284 2018-04-26 12:02:30 except that the previous Chinese buses burned nat. gas (not oil), and the new (electric) ones are likely to still (indirectly) burn (albeit less) nat. gas (at the power station) or worse, coal! EVs = energy saving solutions... nothing more.

6289 2018-04-26 12:01:15 Aww! I'd be doing the car shit and my boy (if I had one) would be cowering in the corner as I cuss at the bolts holding the oil tank together and he'd be like "need any help?" And I'd say "SHUT UP AND LET ME WORK"

6292 2018-04-26 12:01:12 @BillSpadea @nj1015 How about discussing how Hannity borrowed millions from HUD to make a $90 Million fortune on foreclosures sold to minorities that he despises. Real News please Spadea, stop with your snake oil salesman morning act.

6306 2018-04-26 11:59:53 Oil isn't so bad in every aspect! It can be used for so many other things than burning it as a fuel and pestering the air we breath. We have to learn to use the resources for the best for the planet and life! Not primarily for killing ourselves and every other living beings!
6307 2018-04-26 11:59:30 U know what really got under my skin about all of this?

The hateful people having the NERVE to call me Oil
Oil is a name my friends/fam call me. 
Oil is a name my fans call me
Oil is a term of endearment

Y’all weren’t being endearing.

You don’t get to call me Oil.

6348 2018-04-26 11:53:49 Just watched a video where someone said coconut oil broke her out because she's oily and it's an oil meanwhile starving your skin of moisture (oils etc) will just cause your skin to try and compensate i.e. become more oily.

6354 2018-04-26 11:52:28 Coconut oil isn’t rly moisturizing!!!!! Try lanolin (it’s usually used for nipple cream lmao but it’s v nourishing)
6355 2018-04-26 11:52:26 Castor oil & focus on nutrition: protein (plant protein is better bc it easily absorbed & more beneficial), take a muiltivitamin as well so you're still getting the nutrients your body needs.

Coconut oil didn't break you out because it's an oil, it broke you out because it's comedogenic.

6382 2018-04-26 11:49:25 But if Japan's central bank decides that a low yen isn't boosting growth, and oil prices rise, then it may let the yen strengthen to reduce inflation. It would purchase fewer Treasury bonds. That would allow yields to rise, and boost U.S. interest rates.

Renewables always push up the cost of electricity *unless* the fuel cost savings of the stable generators they (intermittently) displace are greater than the cost of generating the renewable energy.
This can be the case when the fuel is oil or gas.

6493 2018-04-26 11:33:13 Inflation cannot really go up by 68%.considering the low crude oil prices I think the government must have managed it at much lower prices.. govt at least owes an explanation as to why they have awarded tenders at such high prices????

6515 2018-04-26 11:30:01 yes, I know. When I wrote the original tweet that cbd oil is not cannabis oil, I did it on the belief that most would understand which product I was referring to. Now I see I should've been more specific. so add 'over the counter' before 'cbd' and it'll make more sense.

6533 2018-04-26 11:27:13 That might be because there's three separate types of "tea tree" - the one that makes the oil is Australian and poisonous, the one that makes the drink is Eurasian, and the one that makes the honey is NZ.

6575 2018-04-26 11:16:20 Thoughts on the USTs 10yr breaking the 3% level. It's not the 3% level that matters going forward but the velocity. Same goes with oil prices. Watch both.
6576 2018-04-26 11:16:15 Global “convulsions” most certainly are a reflection of insecurity of the status quo threatened by movement of poc due to economy, climate and oil wars we started.

6671 2018-04-26 10:54:58 Taxes are the same as they were, oil companies gouging. Prices going from $1.10 to $1.36 has nothing to do with taxes, they don't change when a long weekend comes. It is price fixing and gouging. Period.

6675 2018-04-26 10:54:19 The political management of the high oil price has been disastrous though, and the country is paying the price heavily. We can agree on one thing: the current Venezuelan government is a failure. But calling it «socialism» is ridiculous.

6964 2018-04-26 09:56:14 @AndrewScheer  When fish stocks were high fishermen fished. When low they looked for other occupations. Same with manufacturing & softwood industries. So oil is down find your transferable skills. When oil jobs were booming fishermen left the water for oil sands.

6966 2018-04-26 09:55:47 I think the headline is a selling lie. Out of 100 million barrels a day of worldwide production, bus use is a drop in a bucket. Total  world production per year of oil is 1.5 cubic miles. It only appears to cause problems in concentrated areas, London, New York etc

6996 2018-04-26 09:50:02 Think they would say oil and gas slowdown has been pretty tough. They are leveraged to new exploration activity, which has been hit hugely. But now I am at the edge of my rusty memory, so I wish you well with your research!
6997 2018-04-26 09:49:54 overall land prices were at least 40 % down since 2014...... there is no reason for raw material prices going up (that too by 68%), with crude oil prices at 1/3rd and economy and inflation remaining down throughout since 2014. #ToiletEkScamKatha #KarnatakaDefeatsBJP
6998 2018-04-26 09:49:25 Undoubtedly true but that doesn't change the fact that today and for the foreseeable future we will continue to use coal, oil, gas and nuclear because they are our only reliable source of on demand power. #climatechange

7582 2018-04-26 07:49:54 The problem is, economies don't turn on a dime. While the oil companies are investing heavily in green emerging tech, they also realize that oil will still have a dominant role to play until infrastructures are brought up to speed. Meantime we try burn as clean as possible.
7583 2018-04-26 07:49:42 The oil doesn't seem too economically beneficial from what I have heard though. My biggest issues with this govt is the SGR and coal plant at Lamu. Both policy initiatives look stupid.

And “I dont accepts” and few“generations “ in a virtual talk
7643 2018-04-26 07:38:24 Time we woke up and started using our oil to kickstart our industrial revolution by discounting the energy bills of prospective manufacturing as incentives to relocate to Nigeria; otherwise, we will end up drinking the oil.
7644 2018-04-26 07:38:10 Pasta, garlic, good olive oil, grated romano or parmigiano, crushed chilis. Done.
7645 2018-04-26 07:38:09 I'm not surprised now,that's how it should be.Before you were getting awoof money,( oil money),now that there is no more awoof money meaning you've to labour for it,you'll get old now.
7646 2018-04-26 07:37:43 I'd rather jump in a vat of boiling oil than subscribe to your globalist tripe.
7647 2018-04-26 07:37:33 definitely not a pothead  but I might be investing in CBD oil soon! All this getting old nonsense involves way too much pain, ya feel?

7654 2018-04-26 07:35:10 Houston has more engineers per capita than Seattle or Silicon Valley. 
Oil is tech. Drilling is WAY MORE tech than microchips.
Seattle is software which is NOT tech or science. Or even require a college degree.

7657 2018-04-26 07:34:45 May we not forget Trump's removal of the safeguards and sanctions that were in place to protect the environment against the dangers caused by unrestricted mining and oil drilling, not to mention the irretrievably damaged lands and national monuments.

7664 2018-04-26 07:33:22 Gas prices have risen from $2.20 to $2.60 in less than month in Nortwest Arizona. The Saudis still want $80 - $100/barrel oil prices.

7703 2018-04-26 07:27:11 And the reason for that is..... the taxes that the Shetland Islands Council wrung out of the oil companies.  If you want better roads in the rest of Scotland, local taxes have to go up.

7705 2018-04-26 07:26:32 Oil investments funded by bank loans are not making the returns they thought and bank loans are due. Pompeo doesn't surprise me. Trump needs oil to go up, and soon. Unrest in Syria, Iran, etc helps with this goal. Oh, and Russia has oil.

Bfore 2014 my bill was 800/month 2G plan=9600/yr.
Now its 400 for 3month 4G plan =1200/yr.
savings of 8400/yr. If modi is blamed coz 3rd party raises crude oil price, then he shud also be given credit for fall in mobile bill.

8032 2018-04-26 06:16:49 La taxe qui visait à aligner le gaz oil sur l'essence pour inciter à abandonner le diesel a touché tous les carburants. 
De plus quand le baril était à plus de 100 € voire à 130 € on ne payait pas plus que aujourd'hui, voire moins.
Alors le fric part bien quelque part.

8207 2018-04-26 05:46:28 Cannabis and the hemp plant are the same plant, but cannabis denotes THC, a drug, which cbd is not about.  
It's dishonest marketing to claim it's cannabis oil. Even the ingredients say hemp paste and hemp oil.
8208 2018-04-26 05:46:22 LOL Gas prices going down was the result of the economy  shrinking while oil reserves rose. People like u really need to learn the way our economy works. California is a great example of one that’s about to fail. Less Govt more business is the American way.

8211 2018-04-26 05:46:04 I very much understand and appreciate the things oil has done for humans, it's why our society is where it is today, being the most affluent in human history. But I also feel unadulterated profit is not worth the cost of ruining the place we live

8262 2018-04-26 05:36:20 Yeah, I live in North Dakota and big oil employs 25% of my friends. The stuff being rolled back helps my friends and neighbors. Twitter is the wrong place for a discussion of fossil fuels, because nuance is involved. But people in coal and oil want to keep breathing too.

8301 2018-04-26 05:30:10 What are you talking about! The judge is the person who pretexts British people by applying British law. It is designed in the best interests of our British people which ensures snake oil salesman can’t profit from dying children!  You make it sound like the State kills children!

8307 2018-04-26 05:29:26 Let me explain so you can understand...

Ultra-processed, hyper-palatable food full of seed oil, sugar and flours combined with awful circadian rhythm and a sedentary lifestyle is the root of our obesity epidemic.

8316 2018-04-26 05:27:39 What about the imports from Asia up the Fraser River from Asia to the airport? Between dumping raw sewage and record coal exports it’s a little bit much. Year over year Alberta increases efficiencies upwards of 1% in heavy oil. AB is doing better than most.
8317 2018-04-26 05:27:33 They want people to go against the grain and realize all the left does in pander to minorities and women with promises to put them ahead of other people. You’re not fighting for an equal playing feild you’re fighting for socialism, which historically only leads to term oil.
8318 2018-04-26 05:27:21 Oiled my scalp with peppermint oil. Now it’s time to KO.
8319 2018-04-26 05:26:54 Hiked when global oil prices go up.. but never lowered when they come down.. Reason - How can the entitlement schemes be ignored?

8327 2018-04-26 05:25:41 hahahah our episodes were the two who shot mr. burns episodes and i knew why he school struck oil, and the full quote of moe getting the lie detector
8328 2018-04-26 05:25:19 I personally find Pruitt to be literally the worst thing to come of Trumps presidency. The things he is making happen and the things he is rolling back literally only help big business/oil and hurts the planet (thus people like you and I as we live on the planet).
8329 2018-04-26 05:24:44 I meant what I meant. I needed that oil cleanser

8333 2018-04-26 05:24:27 The Alt right movement is causing hatred in every part of the world! And that's why Libs have moved Left because Canadians have taken that party left in response to the horrible Harper policies that only catered to oil industries & the like. There are many,many Canadians ignored

You know what's not? Using beard growth oil to grow your beard.
8337 2018-04-26 05:23:27 Banks were going out of business, the car industry was about to go belly up, unprecedented foreclosure crisis, AND there was a huge oil spill disaster actively gushing in the gulf in 2010. People have memories of a damn goldfish.

8339 2018-04-26 05:22:53 Just been to IKEA......looked at a couple of food products and they have palm oil as ingredients. I hope this oil isn't sourced from the habitats of critically endangered animals of Malaysia and Indonesia @IKEAUSA #IKEA
8340 2018-04-26 05:22:49 Dont think we are buying oil from Venezuela. No strike in Iraq as everyone is almost dead. Nothing to do with US.
8341 2018-04-26 05:22:48 My father uses CBD oil minus the THC.  He swears by it for arthritis and his degenerative disk disease.

8343 2018-04-26 05:22:13 So this is the GMs fault but the Oilers not addressing their back up goalie, defence, or fwd depth isn't on Chia? Good God, could you carry more water for them, Kurt? I mean, I love that Chia is still employed but the circle jerk from you Edmonton media for him is something else
8344 2018-04-26 05:22:03 You need to lift the front up, get a drip pan, take out the oil pan plug, let that drain out, replace the filter and put the plug back in. Add oil. It's first grade, Sara.

8347 2018-04-26 05:21:46 I’m going to try it. Tea tree oil is harsh so be careful with using it by itself
8348 2018-04-26 05:21:44 That is better. The Generator repairer in my office collected N4500 each for air filter, oil filter and fuel filter. I later discovered the price to be ~N300 each. Bad part was, he didn't even buy the oil filter and he lied. I locked him up and never to see him again in Maryland.
8349 2018-04-26 05:21:43 Quite the irony calling out their mgmt for not getting the dmen but not when it’s the oilers :)

8356 2018-04-26 05:19:25 honestly thank god for adrianna’s essential oil diffuser bc it’s the one thing keeping me sane.
8357 2018-04-26 05:19:21 Yeah they do. You can try adding tea tree oil to some witch hazel. Together the combo takes a while so now I just put the tea tree directly to the spots (which you aren't supposed to do apparently ).
8358 2018-04-26 05:19:15 I used them instead of wipes! When I was feeling fancy I would buy the makeup squares made of cotton and use olive oil to clean their skin!

8360 2018-04-26 05:19:14 If my truck needing an oil change 7000+ miles ago but still being driven ~70-100miles a day isn’t a metaphor for life right now then I don’t know what is
8361 2018-04-26 05:19:09 Only 3 ingredients in fresh cinema popped corn, corn, oil & a little sugar or tiny bit salt depending on type so go popcorn next time! (Used to work in cinema)
8362 2018-04-26 05:18:54 Indirect taxes added on the fuel price at the beginning of the month are going to have adverse effects on the fuel price and inflation as the rand weakens relative to the dollar. Crude oil prices are also not helping as they continue to appreciate
8363 2018-04-26 05:18:37 Currently cooking pasta left behind by a guy I had a thing with, with olive oil that an ex gave me when we were still okay. So I guess I'm grateful that even though boys leave, at least they leave me with food

8365 2018-04-26 05:18:25 You keep saying the state when you actually mean medical experts! If you think a snake oil salesman should be able to manipulate parents and take advantage of a child dying then you absolutely belong on the far right! It’s morning here but thanks, have a good night!

8369 2018-04-26 05:17:18 Imagine being this delusional Hahahaha not surprised every canola oil fan is stupid and delusional and gets pressed when someone doesn’t like their fave.. sad because your fave has been making music for a long time and flopped hard
8370 2018-04-26 05:17:10 Trying to stir it and oil going everywhere
8371 2018-04-26 05:16:49 Listen. I bought a fuckin vape pen so i could smoke cbd oil for my anxiety and the pills I was taking were 30 mg and I didn’t realize one dropper of cbd oil that I have is like 150 mg and I smoked it and y’all sure I can’t get high?
8372 2018-04-26 05:16:34 So Trumps Rhetoric is worse than 9/11 where hundreds of people died? Is his rhetoric worse than the war on Iraq where a number of people died over Weapons of Mass Destruction we never found, people died over oil and money....Are they really that close to each other?
8373 2018-04-26 05:16:32 2 years before significant oil shortages begin to take hold and 4 until it is no longer a viable energy source? I think I read something similar in a book...16 years ago.

8380 2018-04-26 05:15:31 His appointment of people who very clearly are not correct for their jobs (see Carson, Devos and Pruitt as prime examples). Pruitt alone is obviously working for the oil industry and not the betterment of the environment. Also his vast ignorance of basic things is maddening
8381 2018-04-26 05:15:27 Someone who is Stronger than @harbhajan_singh , Powerful than @DJBravo47. #Superkings launched oil recently with instant pickup (relates well to the pickup ad of lifting weights). So Mr.Pride = Gulf Pride 4T Plus. #IdhuNammaPride
8382 2018-04-26 05:15:21 Any normal American would rather vote for Hillary than this maggots, so theres something wrong about Kanye, Democrats ar by far better, it is not about Trump being white, Trump is a clean KKK, dividing the American, hes talking nonsense about middle east, he forgot oil?
8383 2018-04-26 05:15:04 sometimes I dont think I use enough chilis when I make chili oil

8387 2018-04-26 05:14:28 I really like the Lala retro mixed with some of their vitamin c oil. Also the AHA masque is awesome. But if you’re just starting out wanting one thing , I’d do the lala retro or else get a starter pack mix.
8388 2018-04-26 05:14:20 My head itch so bad  as soon as I get out of class I’m going to get some oil
8389 2018-04-26 05:14:14 capitalism sucks but I do love seeing fast food places competing in a race to the bottom with bizarre variations of loaded french fries like checkers having fries and mozz sticks slathered in oil and arby's introducing fucking gyro curly fries
8390 2018-04-26 05:14:00 This is too simplistic, having worked in conservation in around the world including India, the world's largest population of wild tigers, there are many more factors related to plantation agriculture, timber production, mining that are much more relevant than palm oil.

8415 2018-04-26 05:09:14 I didn’t mention state anywhere! I mention medical experts and a judge! You think the judge should allow snake oil salesmen to profit from a dying child? Or you don’t think medical experts aren’t better qualified than those with no medical expertise?

8437 2018-04-26 05:04:17 The constulting with the oil industry. That’s another lie. They haven’t been consulted the govt was going 2 stop permits  this is gold it really doesn’t matter am show this morning poll 68% said govt was doing AWFUL once those petrol rises kicks in and no building.

8446 2018-04-26 05:02:11 What's unproven about solar energy?  And the costs have sharply dropped.  Would you not change to solar (as an example) if it were cheaper to heat your home or run your electricity than gas or oil? the logic is if it's desirable it can be done.

Investing in oil and gas or corporate welfare aren’t even on that list. Wanting to increase taxes on the wealthy (28%) would suggest strong support for the opposite

8500 2018-04-26 04:52:23 I don't think the initial distribution matters all that much in the long run. I think one of cryptos best use case is as a "vehicle currency" for FX. Sort of like how USD works for oil trade. Everyone using USD provides benefits to the whole market, not just the US.

8554 2018-04-26 04:41:52 With oil at 75 usd a barrel and the Oz dollar at .75 not close to parity as it was at the last price spike this means Oz revenue recovery may not be where you think it is. I sniff a debt crisis no matter who is in charge.

8562 2018-04-26 04:40:13 If they had acted properly this past Summer (we all knew their D was insufficient, Rob), they’d likely be in the 2nd round by now. To somehow not put that loss on the GM’s inaction is really letting him off the hook.
8563 2018-04-26 04:40:11 Im confused, Alberta is potentially limiting the amount of oil product to BC and their fuel prices increase. Why the hell are fuel prices so damn high in Alberta? This is insane. How about stepping in Ms. Notley.
Albertans shouldn't have to pay extreme prices for fuel.
8564 2018-04-26 04:40:09 #ItsMyCivicDutyTo   check the oil every week
8565 2018-04-26 04:40:08 ...Also, no one was stopping all houses being taken away for the Olympics airport skytrain & the businesses told to move when they changed from above ground, 2 below ground. I don't see how the #SiteC is different. I support publicly-owned Hydro Power over Ab oil, any day.
8566 2018-04-26 04:39:55 It is. You also lose all the good stuff. Sauteed in olive oil with fresh garlic, and now it's time to see if I still have some of if I used em already.
8567 2018-04-26 04:39:43 Would be nice if you provide more clear tweets on how much oil in storage going up storage going up or down
8568 2018-04-26 04:39:36 I’m clearing my cold with an herbal steam using fresh rosemary and some eucalyptus essential oil. Also had full back cupping done today.

8577 2018-04-26 04:37:47 coconut oil isn’t moisturizing so no, i found it left my skin flakier than normal
8578 2018-04-26 04:37:40 I use @NaturesUltra 500mg lemon-lime oil. Take once a day in the morning. Taking it for restless sleeping and anxiety. They have oils and a rub on. Check em out. If you like what you see use ALRYJAZZ15 for 15% off. Good luck finding an oil that you like!
8579 2018-04-26 04:37:37 I have german shepherds, they tend to have  sensitive stomachs anddd get dry skin from weather changes, so grain free and the fish oil are god sends. Good luck lovely!!!

8583 2018-04-26 04:37:01 Bro.  Oklahoman's warned you.  We told you.  We knew and you didn't listen.  That guy was garbage four OUR state's politics and our legislature is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Oklahoma Oil and Gas Association
8584 2018-04-26 04:36:51 @CostaRonin
I just learned a new Russian trick: drink a shot of Olive oil to outdrink the men at bars. Plus, don't ever tell sex stories w/your mother. .. .men actually don't know when they are poking a couch? #Sadz Great Writers we shall miss
8585 2018-04-26 04:36:41 I agree with almond oil! It has done amazing things for my skin. Also, if you’re looking for a toner, I recommend the Tea Tree Water by Lush!
8586 2018-04-26 04:36:29 No matter how much I oil my hair it still feel dry 
8587 2018-04-26 04:36:09 Get a solid multi vitamin and an omega supplement. I love the gnc fish oil, enteric coated, never had an issue with it. Then make sure you’re getting in 20-30 grams of protein every 2 hours. 4 egg whites is 20 grams. Mix in a cup of veggies and 10oz sweet potato.
8588 2018-04-26 04:36:08 They real! They not injected with synth oil or stuff like that .... hide syringe *
8589 2018-04-26 04:35:36 Lavender oil is seriously the best thing to put in your hair after a long shower!!! Your hair smells good and it promotes hair growth so it’s a win win!!!!!

8591 2018-04-26 04:35:21 Venezuela still has over 60% of its income come from the private sector. Many people can only afford private healthcare and yet. it's apparently socialist, all because someone nationalized the oil!

P.S. And it's being sabotaged internally.
8592 2018-04-26 04:35:20 Exercise maybe? I don't think WW3 is due for a few more weeks. I've already invested in Gold & Oil ..... was holding off on the guns. 
8593 2018-04-26 04:34:41 You could even replace the tomato sauce with herb-infused olive oil for a "Pizza Blanco" delight or an impromptu flatbread appetizer.

I'm like the Martha Stewart of broke slobs
8594 2018-04-26 04:34:37 Butttt really it depends on how much you're wanting to spend too. Theres some crazy expensive ones that my dogs flourished on. But just wasnt going to happen when the pack got to three  try to do grain free if possible too! I find the ones with fish oil are RAD, help with coats
8595 2018-04-26 04:34:06 Allergies are also in general weird as hell because studies are like “soy oil and soy lecithin should not give you an allergic reaction” and I’m like “okay but literally part of what made me realize I’m allergic was eating normal chocolate w/ soy lecithin”
8596 2018-04-26 04:33:56 Prime News: Canadian Economy ‘Finally Positive’ - Central Bank: Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said the economy was “finally positive” after a long adjustment to a sharp drop in oil prices, but he adds there was still softness in several areas of the economy. Poloz also…
8597 2018-04-26 04:33:55 But it's Trump who will grease the skids for oil increases if/when he backs out of the Iran nuclear deal. A sudden shortage of Iranian oil coupled with unexpectedly high demand for oil worldwide could see prices of $100/bbl.
8598 2018-04-26 04:33:41 I just did a hot oil treatment, deep condition , wash , & twist  took me damn near 4 hours

8600 2018-04-26 04:33:30 The only ones not upholding the values of free speech and diversity of opinions are those trying to shut Suzuki down.

The ability to speak up is not the exclusive domain of oil and gas proponents.

You may disagree w David Suzuki, but this demonization is unfair and unfounded.

8602 2018-04-26 04:32:56 My favorite was the Brunello Winery in Montalcino. We even had the family cook us a homemade meal as we sampled their wines, olive oil and jams. A fabulous experience.

8605 2018-04-26 04:32:22 It’s the nation that the Koch bros have been pushing for 50 years! Funded by oil...
8606 2018-04-26 04:32:17 I don't like Hillary Clinton. I just think that the current president is a two bit snake oil salesman. And for the record I'm very confident in my intellectual ability and achievement.
8607 2018-04-26 04:32:05 toasted kale w salt and olive oil is vvv good
8608 2018-04-26 04:31:33 Luna oil was fantastic at shrinking pores but Good Genes just made my skin look as smooth as porcelain. 

Lactic Acid is my favorite acid
8609 2018-04-26 04:31:20 I like to support the local businesses but come on fuckers. You change oil! Put the cap back on!!!
8610 2018-04-26 04:31:18 Oil pulling is disgusting but it’s sooo iconic so I dealllll
8611 2018-04-26 04:31:12 @realDonaldTrump Is A Snake Oil FRAUD And Nothing More! I Do Not Care What His Maga Fans Think! If His Fans Can Defend Someone So EVIL, That Is On Their Conscience! His Fans Are Unable To Comprehend His DAMAGE! I Am Certain The Founding Fathers NEVER Would Have Tolerated Him!!!
8612 2018-04-26 04:31:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, yet their ability to be financially self-sufficient.
8613 2018-04-26 04:31:08 I think I’m gonna try using coconut oil for my skin instead of lotion.
8614 2018-04-26 04:30:59 I felt bad having to explain to a pair of customers who were worried that their painting hadn't dried that it wouldn't be completely dry for another 6 months. Thats what happens when you use oil paints and a hella lot of it ToT
8615 2018-04-26 04:30:58 Just want to lay up , and get rubbed with coconut oil 
8616 2018-04-26 04:30:52 No, soap molecules act as a bridge so that oil/dirt/anything that cant be removed with only water can now be removed by suspending them in the soap molecules. Soap molecules are basically nets, and the water carries the net

You also can't just make water molecules 'smaller'
8617 2018-04-26 04:30:50 @newdirectionsau can you guys ship Tea tree oil to India?

8626 2018-04-26 04:29:17 I've got shelves and filing cabinets full of data on the future of oil, perhaps you should read a bit. Or go to the petroleum conferences and talk to the geologists and engineers like I have.
8627 2018-04-26 04:28:52 The process is as follows: Shampoo, condition, dry, comb (wooden), oil, comb (wooden), brush (horse hair), balm. #vBeards

8630 2018-04-26 04:28:26 a billion barrels you say? 10 days supply of oil? Ghawar peaked, it's watercuts are over 50%. The 2020 prediction was from last week's wall street journal. I've been studying energy issues for 13 years and spent time talking with petro geologists and engineers.
8631 2018-04-26 04:28:22 I think that's the best case scenario. Worst case is these people are paid to build boarder wall, pave access roads for oil companies and collect information about immigrants. But that would never happen because Americans only elect angels to office...
8632 2018-04-26 04:28:16 HOW DO I CHANGE THE OIL IN MY CAR
8633 2018-04-26 04:28:08 I called my local MLA and MP and voiced my dismay at the high gas prices. We need our local leaders to talk to Horgan. Imagine the pain when Alberta and Saskatchewan cut oil supply? $2 a litre or $3.
8634 2018-04-26 04:27:47 Deut 14:23 And thou shalt eat before the LORD thy God, in the place which he shall choose to place his name there, the tithe of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the firstlings of thy herds and of thy flocks; that thou mayest learn to fear the LORD thy God always.
8635 2018-04-26 04:27:40 And their idea of "cleaning it up" involved just power washing the engine and spraying the oil all over my car. Hawks Prairie Automotive. 
8636 2018-04-26 04:27:35 since when was taking money from big oil a progressive stance?
8637 2018-04-26 04:27:07 Nyaay cge ratag katalsikan sa oil ani ba nah

8648 2018-04-26 04:25:40 You were making fun of someone because they don't have a university degree. Was both a cheap shot and low blow. Also have no clue why U of A would give Suzuki an honorary degree. What next? name Tzeporah Berman CoChair of Oil Sands advisory committee? We've already done that too
8649 2018-04-26 04:25:38 Just flower and oil for now
8650 2018-04-26 04:25:32 If anything, it's companies like Chevron who set the prices. The state government only regulates how clean/refined the oil is so that we don't continue to kill Earth.
8651 2018-04-26 04:25:24 Yep, they were that angry that they tried to change the sea border to take the oil waters for WM. That was blocked but not completly. We lost some due to that change!

8653 2018-04-26 04:24:51 i mixed rose hips oil with coconut oil which helped a little bit, and it made my skin really soft and glowy too! it took a lot of patience though to be honest
8654 2018-04-26 04:24:34 It’s more like we want their oil
8655 2018-04-26 04:24:28 Baby oil and warm vanilla sugar

8660 2018-04-26 04:23:28 He was targeted because of communal angle don't discredit Hindus with worthless idea's ? Whole world will bracket us since rest are Christian/Muslim countries! Its unique Hindustan that's helping us. modiji goes to Muslim countries for oil calling himself Hindustani not Hindu?
8661 2018-04-26 04:23:26 But the Trump administration’s indifference to the sudden turmoil in the aluminum market stemming from U.S. sanctions on Rusal, a major Russian aluminum producer, suggests Trump might shrug off oil market chaos as well.
8662 2018-04-26 04:22:33 I literally put chili oil in everything I eat. Literally.
8663 2018-04-26 04:22:12 So apparently me and my mom are new to the planet and have just discovered coconut oil. We now use, eat, sleep and breathe coconut oil. A tad obsessed, you can say
8664 2018-04-26 04:21:45 Side note, gonna try coconut oil and shea butter mixed together for my hair, wish me luck

8680 2018-04-26 04:18:16 @HouseAppropsGOP.  @EPAScottPruitt  I feel that he has spent a lot of money that isn't necessary.  He agrees with oil and coal companies and profits from. he said this @realDonaldTrump   and in February 2016, said that Donald Trump would be "more abusive to the Constitution.

8687 2018-04-26 04:17:00 That’s because there hasn’t been any real oil tanker shipment activity up until this proposal. 5 Aframax tankers heading down the coast and a handful of total, previous shipments to Asia can’t be compared to the more than one each day they’re planning!

8697 2018-04-26 04:15:04 the only essential oil i need is that crude oil baby FILL  ER  UP

8704 2018-04-26 04:13:54 Why we earmarked 200, 000ha for oil palm plantation –Obaseki
8705 2018-04-26 04:13:49 Indonesia menempati peringkat 1 dalam produk pertanian,
yaitu : cengkeh (cloves) & pala (nutmeg), serta no.2 dalam karet
alam (Natural Rubber) dan minyak sawit mentah (Crude Palm Oil).
8706 2018-04-26 04:13:34 Of course they are. They barely live long and are slaughtered. But that aside we don’t need to eat them to get Omega 3’s. Hemp oil is an awesome source!!
8707 2018-04-26 04:13:33 The sob story that Cons from Alberta whine about every time someone stand up to big oil. And their threats to shut down oil to BC and their threats proves they are scared of #FreedomOfSpeech and protests of #KinderMorgan. #bcpoli #abpoli #skpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM #ProtectTheInlet

8713 2018-04-26 04:13:12 i had one & nothing worked. i used tea tree oil in the mornings & a lavender essential oil before bed & it was gone after about 3 days!

8715 2018-04-26 04:12:54 I love cooking but i dont like frying oil popping and burning my skin
8716 2018-04-26 04:12:46 i put neem oil on my face and it fucking stinks!! so i washed it and i still smell it
8717 2018-04-26 04:12:45 Not a contradiction! Just reinforces further the absolute need to stop any further oil & gas drilling, which inherently releases more methane into the atmosphere.

8723 2018-04-26 04:11:49 I understand Notley's frustration with this tone-deaf UofA move. Suzuki compared Albertans - including working class ones - to Southern slaveowners. Talk about punching down.

8729 2018-04-26 04:10:49 It’s a weird day where I agree with @kanyewest and disagree with you. McDs nugs aren’t the same as they were when we were kids. They changed the oil, or removed the chicken lips, and they lost their flavor.

8737 2018-04-26 04:10:04 Right? I was 10 minutes early to my oil change appt this morning and sat there for an hour and a half. Then the mofos forgot to put the cap back on. You fucking kidding me bro?
8738 2018-04-26 04:09:52 I only like the Jamaican black castor oil strengthen & restore
8739 2018-04-26 04:08:56 Just one day, that's all I want to be able to feel a fraction of the kind of blind self-confidence that white privilege provides Tomi with. I reckon it'd feel like swimming in extra virgin olive oil naked 
8740 2018-04-26 04:08:44 I have the palmers oil that I use too. I think they will , I hope 
8741 2018-04-26 04:08:26 But you see Ted, here's the thing: Saudi Arabia has a shit ton of oil & is a mortal enemy of Iran, ergo no US response.
8742 2018-04-26 04:08:20 That seems like a lot of work. I just built my own tire burning stove. They put out a ton of heat and old tires are free. Everyone’s looking to get rid of them. So no trees sacrificed, oil stays in the ground, no coal mined. It’s the green way.
8743 2018-04-26 04:08:20 bio oil!!

8782 2018-04-26 04:01:48 A marine diesel fuel leak isn't really an #OilSpill, it's a #FuelLeak...and you've got a photo of what appears to be buckets of used motor oil that have no connection to the event being reported on.

C'mon, @SputnikInt. Do better.
8783 2018-04-26 04:01:46 Oh no. How were your moisturizing your hair? Liquid, oil then cream or liquid, cream then oil?
8784 2018-04-26 04:01:40 Please clarify,.. do the Liberals want Canada to be self sufficient in our energy needs? Or will they continue to bring oil in from afar in direct contrast to their Canadian values! Just wanting it clarified. Thx

8808 2018-04-26 03:58:21 Explain how reopening coal mines makes sense? It's on your list. Any other 19th century technology you want to bring back? Whale oil? Wooden teeth? 
8809 2018-04-26 03:57:56 @MEGeist How can you claim on your show that Enbridge Line 5 transports 540,000 barrels per day [bpd] (23M gallons) of crude oil to Sarnia when Sunoco pipeline at Marysville taps it for 190,000 bpd flow to 3 Detroit-Toledo refineries leaving only 350,000 bpd going to Ontario?
8810 2018-04-26 03:57:45 It's pretty frightening that academic independence & freedom is being undermined by oil lobby groups. Donations do not convey ownership.
I am honestly pretty shocked by @RachelNotley's statements also.
She seems to have lost any sense of integrity.
8811 2018-04-26 03:57:42 Oh, so did we allocate what resources are where? Did we put oil in the Middle East?
8812 2018-04-26 03:57:36 I like how they freak out over some jobs (pipeline protestors), but argue that jobs with pro-life and anti-abortion groups should be allowed. Oil is more important than women's rights, I guess...
8813 2018-04-26 03:57:20 A simple way to elevate mood and raise the frequency of your home or office is to diffuse essential oils. As the aroma fills the space, everyone there including pets can benefit. What's your favorite oil to diffuse? - Selacia

8816 2018-04-26 03:56:58 Oil companies get subsidies (welfare) meant for struggling industries. They thrive, but still get the handout. Because they earned it?  No, they don’t qualify. It’s because lobbyists put fossil fuel congressmen in their pockets.

8826 2018-04-26 03:55:53 Yeah, I'm on a medically mandated high sodium diet (for POTS). My body craves sodium, always has. But as a kid/teen I'd have strong GI reactions to autolyzed yeast extract/MSG & cottonseed oil. I avoided Campbell's & McDonald's like the plague, but it was everywhere in the 90s.

8846 2018-04-26 03:52:20 Coconut Oil hasn't caused me to break out. I put some tea tree oil in it, but I cleanse afterwards. It's really a hit or miss situation.

8857 2018-04-26 03:50:49 He deliberately misled (lied) about GMO’s, fish farming and oil and greatly exaggerated many other claims.  He is obnoxious to those who question him.  As a @UAlberta alumnus this is insulting.
8858 2018-04-26 03:50:47 Seems like it. All that invested time for brief moments of glory.

8861 2018-04-26 03:49:43 Ehh, stuff like E.V.O.O (extra virgin olive oil) or “salt ’n pep!”. They think it’s cute. It’s not cute. It irks the hell out of me.
8862 2018-04-26 03:49:30 You didn't ask me, but maybe this helps: Venezuela has a comparatively high gdp per capita (oil). HDI is highly sensitive to that. I'd have to see the numbers, but I don't think the difference is stemming from better educational or health outcomes.
8863 2018-04-26 03:49:28 At time of WWII, Britain & US sent spies to Ottoman Empire region to seek oil reserves. At War's end, France England & US divided former Ottoman/Turkish empire into "Nations" (oil reserves) that are now an eternal War playground for US/France/GreatBritian to capture oil resources

8878 2018-04-26 03:47:24 Along those lines of thought, some are calling Universal Basic Income the same thing as Alaska's oil dividend. That's not a bad idea. Make the automation companies pay for UBI, raise rents for all sect 8 "remote" houses in neighborhoods if they don't take care of the yards.

8903 2018-04-26 03:44:51 This is pretty surprising –Ted Cruz said that he would consider bringing up an anti-trust action against Facebook and other tech companies, and bust them up like we did to Standard Oil a hundred years ago.

8906 2018-04-26 03:44:38 I view the RB like motor oil in an engine. Just cuz it’s cheap to replace doesn’t mean it’s not important or doesn’t make a difference. My 2 cents.
8907 2018-04-26 03:44:38 This is troubling because I respect the two Marks...Steyn and Levin. I would hate to see a snake oil salesman create a breach between important voices who should be supportive of each other.

8923 2018-04-26 03:42:04 We already do. The problem is the type of oil. We have certain types of crude, other countries have different ones. We export what we don't need and import other oil. We also have to deal with domestic and foreign refineries scaling back production, artificially inflating prices

I.e. oil dependent u.s. putin doesn't want. Strong u.s. military putin doesn't want. Missle defense along russia border. Putin doesn't want.
8951 2018-04-26 03:38:56 That's dedication by @HollyTaylor97 .  Wonder if she also made the sacrifice of downing vodka after the olive oil?

8967 2018-04-26 03:36:50 They’ll soon be painting the lampposts in Liverpool with oil ...crisco is oil, right?
8968 2018-04-26 03:36:25 Olive oil.
8969 2018-04-26 03:36:24 The longer we wait, the more expensive it will be to fix the problem. We won’t have oil forever anyway. Why not start now to get off it?
8970 2018-04-26 03:36:16 skincare threads are like:
-eat 4 bowls of pure aloe Vera a day it’ll work wonders!!
-drink so much water you pee out of your nose!
-take a bath in coconut oil
-use these 17 face masks and you MIGHT see results in 6 months
8971 2018-04-26 03:36:14 Sweet. I was on an Attack Aircraft Carrier in Vietnam & to Saudi > first oil crisis. It still had a wooden flight deck :-)@chuckwoolery
8972 2018-04-26 03:36:13 Huffington Post reports that Mike Pompeo had a relationship with a Chinese oil & Gas co.
8973 2018-04-26 03:36:10 He is remarkably beautiful. Looks like he belongs in an oil painting or in a gallery of marble sculptures. Michelangelo would have been TOTALLY gay for him.
8974 2018-04-26 03:36:09 अच्छा, आवाज़ निकल आयी तुम्हारी? पहले फैक्ट्स चेक किया करो। इंडिया सिर्फ 4.4 millions barrel crude oil निर्यात करता है। China is the top importer who imports 8.4 millions barrel per day.

8976 2018-04-26 03:35:55 If they're willing to publicly tip Paul Ryan $500,000 for cutting their taxes, why wouldn't they be willing to cut checks to Marc Short for eliminating regulations that affect their oil refineries?

8978 2018-04-26 03:35:33 I looked at a few recipes and kind of synthesized them into one!
I did potato + kimchi + chili garlic paste + green chili + broth + mirin + sardine + fresh ginger + green onion + sesame oil + sesame seeds -> pressure cooked for 15 min, served over brown rice! it's almost ready!
8979 2018-04-26 03:35:30 What sob story? You didn't answer the question..would you be ok with Alberta (and Saskatchewan) choking off that evil oil to BC? I have a feeling as soon as self righteous ideologues like yourself would have to pay $300 to fill a Honda Fit the rhetoric would be dialled way back

8985 2018-04-26 03:34:50 Hannity in many ways is worse than Humpty Trumpty. Where one has a delusion and believes his own narrative the other (SH) writes the narrative, never believing a word of it. In the 19th century he would have been a rich snake oil salesman. A true charlatan and opportunist.
8986 2018-04-26 03:34:32 When I was a cook, all my work shirts had olive oil and grease on them.

Now they have polyolester oil and alkylbenzene.
8987 2018-04-26 03:34:19 Oil price cycles tend to overshoot on both the upside & the downside. The price of oil never stays at the right price for very long because a small over supply can push the price quite low & a small under supply can cause a big price spike. There is no quick fix #lka

8993 2018-04-26 03:33:13 With the recent uptick in oil prices, I’m anticipate a solid quarter that should beat expectations.  Hopefully leads to 1-2$ bump in the stock!

9002 2018-04-26 03:32:25 Cynthia baby, the money for these tunnels came from the Sunni Gulf State Nations. They may have sold a bunch of crude oil to US people, who got value in return for their money. It was not a gift of funds. My President Trump stopped the CIA arming these folks, an HRC/Obama program

9008 2018-04-26 03:31:15 Iran's economic mess gives Trump leverage - WaPo. Rial plunged, CPI high + credit crisis. Uncertainty re nuclear accord plus more sanctions could exacerbate internal problems. US might be able to forge better agreement by applying pressure

9009 2018-04-26 03:31:14 When I tell my fellow Canadians the housing market is overvalued, I get looks of total contempt...like in 2013 when I said oil would go to $40...Nuthin' but smug self-satisfied idiots up here.
9010 2018-04-26 03:31:01 The cost of training someone to be on location to work on your stuff is DRASTICALLY less than if you lose control of your PCN/Scada and you put oil overboard. I promise
9011 2018-04-26 03:30:57 It’d be handy to catch an oil leak under an old pickup truck. Send me one, please.
9012 2018-04-26 03:30:49 Awe cute, there it is...the low brow insult. I went to Ambridge high. Armco was still maybe open then, J&l and most others were gone. Was referring to your statement of “your oil based economy” so I assume you believe I am Russian?  You guys really need to seek help. Out.

9021 2018-04-26 03:29:54 I’m so obsessed with the Moroccan Oil hair products. I need it all! 
9022 2018-04-26 03:29:52 Agreed. We seem to be in denial that our bitumen is a lesser grade than oil from other regions. Yet another pipeline isn’t going to change that nor is withholding donations to the UofA out of spite over a honorary degree
9023 2018-04-26 03:29:46 SOALNYA SCALP-KU JUGA KERING :"))) coba cari yg mengandung olive/kukui nut. Sekarang hair oil udah banyak yg bikin sih, dulu aku beli sendiri oil-nya terus campur2 :")) kalo pake oil di scalp-nya aja, pijit2, diemin ±1 jam, baru keramas.

9049 2018-04-26 03:25:12 Hair oil :"O aku sering lihat sih di pasaran. Kayak brandnya L'oreal gitu gitu kan? So it does work...
9050 2018-04-26 03:25:12 It's barely oil. It's truly tar with a good portion of the sand removed (not all). China's calls it "garbage crude" and its price tag reflects that label. If ABns refined the bitumen (there are a few refineries already) many many more jobs wld be created and more $ for oil

9057 2018-04-26 03:23:29 I just learned that Oil is not a fossil fuel and that the whole “limited supply” bullshit was just a scam to give it more value. 

I repeat Oil is a renewable resource.

9107 2018-04-26 03:16:06 the us marines r gonna flip when they find out how much oil my face produces
9108 2018-04-26 03:15:53 Canada is subsidizing oil consumption by over 100 million USD per day. Importing low standards. Our oil is landlocked. Environmentalists +paid lobbyists are an impediment, poor Federal leadership.Time to cut through BS and do what's right for Canada. Take a stand! Thank you.
9109 2018-04-26 03:15:14 Rub me up with some baby oil.
9110 2018-04-26 03:15:00 Gonna drink olive oil before I go out anywhere now #TheAmericans
9111 2018-04-26 03:15:00 मैंने बहुत पहले कह दिया है कि ये पाप पार्टी राजनीति का " इस्लाम " है.... अभी आगे आगे देखो हिटलर भी इसके  सामने बच्चा ना लगा तो...
9112 2018-04-26 03:14:47 Our issue is Oil!! We will reach the develop or die point when oil prices permanently drop and it's not even worth the corruption hassle.
9113 2018-04-26 03:14:46 If you expose and get all the way down into the truth BBC will show up everytime and this WAR over oil and land who wants your land!

9115 2018-04-26 03:14:15 @davidstassen, your Insta-content makes me laugh. A lot.

"What am I? Made of oil?"
9116 2018-04-26 03:14:14 Yes! Vidalia onion dipped in tempura batter, then buried in Japanese panko  The only thing that would have made it better is if I fried it in olive oil. Never made home made onion rings before. They were way easier than I thought 
9117 2018-04-26 03:14:02 It was low oil price & related smaller oil subsidies coupled with higher excise duties on fuel that helped India paint a better macro picture between 2015 & 2017. If the govt has to give back some of those slippery fiscal gains as crude oil prices climb, things will be different.
9118 2018-04-26 03:13:58 That chicken oil based u can keep the grease 
9119 2018-04-26 03:13:52 Is that olive oil trick real? And if so why did I not know when I was in my 20s?!!! #TheAmericans
9120 2018-04-26 03:13:45 Putik!!! Mao mao pag nawong natalsikan pajod og oil syakittttt!!!

9121 2018-04-26 03:13:40 that's olive oil right? asking for a friend. #TheAmericans
9122 2018-04-26 03:13:39 Rupee weakening is awesome good news for exporters. Rejoice. Reduce  oil usage!
9123 2018-04-26 03:13:26 Wait, does that olive oil thing really work? #TheAmericans
9124 2018-04-26 03:13:25 Is that true or they made that up ? Olive oil keeps you sober longer ?? #TheAmericans
9125 2018-04-26 03:13:23 Because somehow, if we just ship more of our oil to the coast that will magically create a demand in Asia for a commodity that their refineries can’t actually use while they rapidly move reduce dependence on foreign oil
9126 2018-04-26 03:13:17 Tea tree oil !
9127 2018-04-26 03:13:11 Olive oil? Who knew? Drinking with #TheAmericans
9128 2018-04-26 03:13:01 my face is thirsty for this coconut rose oil 
9129 2018-04-26 03:12:57 US now exporting more crude oil than Nigeria
9130 2018-04-26 03:12:39 Idk if it’s bc I’ve had nothing but good energy lately or the avocado oil I put on my face but either way I’m happy af 
9131 2018-04-26 03:12:39 if i were you i’d think about it a lot cause you wear eye makeup a lot and especially eyeliner the oil removes the glue and then removing the makeup with a makeup wipe might rip some of the lashes out. buy an oil free makeup remover and i’d recommend just not wearing eyeliner
9132 2018-04-26 03:12:28 It's despicable that anyone allows Fracking in their state or oil drilling. Have you seen Texas sinkhole maps? There are so many oil wells, that most of the state is sinking. Maybe it's time to allow them to secede since they want to anyway. Oh, and no more federal aid for TX.

9134 2018-04-26 03:12:07 The elephant helping the young ninja get night tail. Why couldn't you be my father!?!?!?? Lol.
9135 2018-04-26 03:11:54 I actually got a job at a medical cannibis facility working with oil. It really helps Bens dad cope w/ the pain of his pancreatic cancer & he knew that we were in need of extra income so he told me about an opening with a company that makes and packages oil. Its legal of course-
9136 2018-04-26 03:11:29 Oil (-): US crude inventories rose by 2.17m barrels last week to 429.7m, highest in 4wks - EIA. Record exports weren't enough to offset climb in production, unexpected drop in refinery crude runs
9137 2018-04-26 03:11:28 I really want a oil burner
9138 2018-04-26 03:11:24 All these years drinking and #TheAmericans teaching me about Olive Oil to coat the stomach. Who knew ? 
9139 2018-04-26 03:11:24 a good week so far sponsored by: hyaluronic acid, tea tree oil, blooming trees, wine, and a live performance by the band that got me thru depression 2 years ago
9140 2018-04-26 03:11:15 Millions of Canadians opposed to fossil fuel expansion are paying taxes some of which go to subsidizing profitable foreign oil/ pipeline corporations. IMF data shows in 2014 it was $800+ per Canadian. #stopkm #cdnpoli
9141 2018-04-26 03:11:08 Dad's early birthday gift to me is an oil change and I appreciate it lol
9142 2018-04-26 03:10:57 どこ待ち合わせる？
9143 2018-04-26 03:10:46 Yes, but to simply go to an oil rig with a computer, you have to attend survival training school that costs a ton of money. Those expenses rack up really fast.
9144 2018-04-26 03:10:41 Your argument is nonsense. take off your blinders and accept that oil is not going to be the answer to Alberta's woes. #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM #ProtectTheInlet

9147 2018-04-26 03:09:53 No one should be surprised at Trumps selective amnesia when it comes to statements he's made in the past. The man is a snake oil salesman and conning people is his business. I really hope Michael da fixer comes to regret his decision to take the 5th.
9148 2018-04-26 03:09:42 To the person who came in with an olive oil “allergy” we have a new SOP in place for you we break your leg and rub olive oil in the would of you have a reaction we believe you
9149 2018-04-26 03:09:32 Alright home boys, I'll be online tomorrow around 8/9pm cst. I wanna bathe in oil and glitter and then cum all over a dildo, so let's do that!

9152 2018-04-26 03:09:24 When you boil down the hate for ISIS, it usually comes to revulsion against beheading. So how is KSA different? Simple. One allows access to oil and the other doesn't.
9153 2018-04-26 03:09:18 A direct plea to the Koch Brothers. Pay us more and they'll get more. They have had one hell of a return on their investment in Republicans. There needs to be a special tax rate for the Kochs in 2020: 90%. If they divest of oil and gas holdings, they can have the rate shrunk.
9154 2018-04-26 03:09:12 I use it for:
facemask/mixed with coconut oil 
grey coverage/mixed with coconut oil or eco styles gel

detox/mixed in water
Eyebrow enhancer 
*You got me giving away all my tips
9155 2018-04-26 03:08:59 no i just rewashed it with a different oil rn lmao 
9156 2018-04-26 03:08:49 Hey now.   He hasn't had to change the oil yet.   Think of the savings Hagey!
9157 2018-04-26 03:08:44 Obviously he does not know how that works. Tax the oil companies and they in turn will make the consumers pay more for the product. Therefore the consumers end up paying the taxes imposed on the oil companies.

9158 2018-04-26 03:08:40 Spent the evening researching which CBD oil to buy and got overwhelmed and now I'm more confused than when I sat down. Pls tell me your personal anecdotes/recommendations.

9161 2018-04-26 03:08:09 Hmm, my oil based economy? You supposedly being from PA? Who’s the bot here? And I do speak more than one language. Trump , despite some excessive tweeting, is doing a pretty damn good job thus far. Too bad your party is focused solely on chasing shadows.
9162 2018-04-26 03:07:58 Sis its 11 pm i dont have time for that im just rewashing them and i poured vanilla essential oil on them too LMAO
9163 2018-04-26 03:07:24 I spent about 15 days in a hearing to get a guy his job back after BC Hydro fired him for rubbing marijuana oil on his back.
9164 2018-04-26 03:07:00 A competent administrator might ultimately make the risk decision their XP ICS network can function with conficker on it if it’s infected by USB, and spend the money on a better gateway security appliance for remote access instead of replacing computers on 4 oil rigs.

9168 2018-04-26 03:06:01 it is ok now just put some oil since that is what my aunt adviced me to do if my skin hurts
9169 2018-04-26 03:05:59 I love doing aroma therapy, either with orange and lemon peels with cinnamon boiling in a pot. Vanilla scented candles, or burn nag champa. Lavender is another favorite. I'll put a few drops of lavender oil in a spray bottle, or have dried flowers under the pillow.

9188 2018-04-26 03:03:43 need an oil change already 
9189 2018-04-26 03:03:43 Inflation has gone up without raising the minimum wage which is even worse!!!! Why are teachers protesting nationwide? Why do families have to work 3 jobs? Why do oil companies have extremely low tax rates at the expense of the working class? Your logic isn’t working
9190 2018-04-26 03:03:33 Dude. Lay off the hemp oil. Wait. What was that stuff called again? I don't remember from every time you open your mouth.
9191 2018-04-26 03:03:31 charlamagne let me tell something you already look like a crockpot shined with baby oil bitch
9192 2018-04-26 03:03:23 Russia’s oil based economy is already in the sh*tter. It’s not going to get better anytime one soon. Even if/when it does, it won’t benefit anyone but a few oil oligarchs and Putin.
9193 2018-04-26 03:03:23 my mom kept this old ammo can covered in spray paint that had stubs of oil paints and old brushes and like. supplies that weren't NEW but that she still kept. i think for the same reason? i don't remember but yeah!!!

9212 2018-04-26 03:00:07 Insurance is still raising he stopped it for a moment we need single payer. America created Osama Bin Laden and ISIS as a proxy force to steal oil from the middle East. Paris agreement has been ridiculed as too late and too little.  he allowed them to get married?? That's it.
9213 2018-04-26 02:59:50 Oil doesn't make the top ten industries by GDP so not all that surprising.
9214 2018-04-26 02:59:44 I’m using tea tree oil rn and mederma and it made my face break out a lil but I’m sure that’s just the beginning until it kicks in  but ima check it out if this doesn’t work.
9215 2018-04-26 02:59:44 “any oil spill, be it crude oil or diluted bitumen, represents a tragedy and catastrophe. It will harm the natural environment, will kill some marine organisms, and will be very hard to clean up.” Then the reality Blair is to not take such a risk if there’s no evidence of gain!

9218 2018-04-26 02:59:24 Same nonsense about phytoestrogens. The only way soy would be bad for your skin or health in general is the fountain of oil used on dishes and vegan soy products. You would have to consistently eat like 10+ servings of soy per day to affect your hormones significantly
9219 2018-04-26 02:59:04 That ultimatum blew up in their faces. Albertans really didn’t like rich assholes telling them what to think... unless apparently the rich assholes are oil companies and now tax advisory companies.

9221 2018-04-26 02:58:47 Face Cream also has the same ingredients but include bamboo extract which is a bomb ingredient. Everything in it is to help reduce the production of melanin and dry out any acne. This is the only moisturizer we offer with teatree oil in it.

9244 2018-04-26 02:56:10 I be having that same issue. And I use oil on my whole body so I don’t know why my shit be itching either. Can’t be growing cause I’ve had these titties since my senior year in high school.
9245 2018-04-26 02:56:06 OKC getting blown out in front of their home crowd of farmers and oil consultants. Tragic
9246 2018-04-26 02:55:54 Gardiner would be a minus 50 on the oilers
9247 2018-04-26 02:55:49 the price of oil is a constant, independent of the exchange value of the USD. and will adjust higher on a weak greenback... which might partially explain the current price of oil?
9248 2018-04-26 02:55:46 Wonder what the odds are that the "perps of this grave offence" are Russian or brown people that have oil.
9249 2018-04-26 02:55:42 i freakin add olive oil all over my face to get that dewy look and its worth it lol 
9250 2018-04-26 02:55:16 I read the title and immediately knew it was too smart for me. Science and I are like oil and water lol
9251 2018-04-26 02:55:14 The night before wash day, I love to put peppermint oil on my scalp and massage it in. It feels soooooo good!
9252 2018-04-26 02:55:11 I can only sit here and shake my head. Russia and their dictator have had a lot to do with it. Lost American souls believing in what the snake oil salesman little donnie hitler and the Fourth Reich GOP had to say.  Their invidious behavior will be their downfall.
9253 2018-04-26 02:55:11 yes especially when im hooking with hot oil
9254 2018-04-26 02:55:02 I have so much coconut oil in my hair it’s ridiculous
9255 2018-04-26 02:54:49 Poised for a comeback? There are literally no more wells to be drilled. My assignments this week are how to test rocks for any oil & gas content. It’s ALL that’s left! There’s nothing TO come back.
9256 2018-04-26 02:54:43 So...BC says yes to oil tankers but no to pipelines?   Interesting....
9257 2018-04-26 02:54:38 What about margarine made from coconut or palm oil? Those are what we have in Phils. Are these any good?
9258 2018-04-26 02:54:32 if he stays. he needs a more limited role. obviously meaning we need another number 3.
9259 2018-04-26 02:54:32 Oil and gas companies have a vested interest in discrediting human-caused climate change. As a result, they spend millions on PR to get the public to believe that it's not real. Do you agree or disagree?
9260 2018-04-26 02:54:28 Hahahahahaha BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Hahahahahahaha BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Hahahahahahaha Hahahahahaha BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
9261 2018-04-26 02:54:20 turns out i was good bc i applied it like an hour before i started crying AND i sealed it in with moisturizer + face oil :’)) 

2018 is the year of unabashedly googling your v serious questions !!

9263 2018-04-26 02:54:01 The oil sands lobby is embarrassing.
9264 2018-04-26 02:53:59 I use a combination of the cetaphil acne prone oil control moisturizer n the ordinary natural moisturizing factors at night then in the morning only the ordinary one bc the cetaphil leaves my skin kinda greasy
9265 2018-04-26 02:53:46 I've watched him plenty and would take the trade-off for what he can bring to the PP on a team like the Oilers.
9266 2018-04-26 02:53:41 How about @hallsy09 straight up?  Wait...,

9268 2018-04-26 02:53:33 The conductor is very firm, you thing Virgin olive oil comes from???
9269 2018-04-26 02:53:12 I told my man we were out of baby wipes and he tells me to use “Cotton balls and Baby Oil” ... I’m not a fucking caveman!

9271 2018-04-26 02:53:04 I need a vacation.. A massage .. A hot oil treatment.. Something hell

9273 2018-04-26 02:52:55 Why is it that every time I hear traditional news, I feel like I'm being constantly sold snake oil?
9274 2018-04-26 02:52:43 I will go into a much more in depth explanation of why those parts are so significant for me. Gosh I love End of Eva...

Jeez... For someone that mostly posts about sports, I sure am a weeb...
9275 2018-04-26 02:52:35 We won't see it soon, but it will happen.  Cheap solar panels, etc will happen. Oil eventually will run out.  I'm talking a couple of centuries.  But it won't take much to make green energy appealing when affordable.
9276 2018-04-26 02:52:32 - Use tea tree oil or apple cider vinegar (it’s stANKS but it works) 
- if you use face masks often and you don’t see a difference try to use them less and see if you notice results. 
- and ofc drink water !!!
9277 2018-04-26 02:52:28 Chicken oil base u can keep the grease @_noplug

9281 2018-04-26 02:51:43 Damned Trudeau!
If he is doing all to favour/keep Alberta, why not turn oil area into industrial zone to make green devices—wind turbos/solar panels.
China now leading market for these.  Create in Canada by oil workers or take some jobs down East - where many workers come from.

9286 2018-04-26 02:51:12 It’s very much a dying industry. This very week, I’m studying how to test rocks to determine gas & oil composition. It’s literally all that’s left. The oil pockets (wells)? There aren’t anymore.
9287 2018-04-26 02:51:10 Ummmm so is mine but use rosehip oil!! It’s like $6 at Tj Maxx and works pretty good
9288 2018-04-26 02:50:58 I need an oil change  but no time!
9289 2018-04-26 02:50:53 Watch him all year and you’ll see a defensemen that only stretch passes and commits a large volume of unforced turnovers every game.  Good teams will always expose players like him.

9291 2018-04-26 02:50:23 I need to get my registration done and get an oil change 
9292 2018-04-26 02:50:23 I started IF in the fall and it has been a game changer. I added Lions Mane to my BP coffee, and I use MCT oil instead of brain octane, although after the boards and gaining employment, I'll do the brain octane. I highly encourage it!

9297 2018-04-26 02:49:31 Now it’s time for the oil
9298 2018-04-26 02:49:25 Remember when oil prices were hiked up because the president (both bushes) had a stake in the oil industry? I do. Hmm these are real estate prices. What business are the Trump's in again? I know it's not oil

9303 2018-04-26 02:48:46 Does baby oil really make sex as exciting as porn makes it seem?
9304 2018-04-26 02:48:37 Oil and water based on the personalities, I get, but what about the measurables? Just like Elway drafted Brock based on prototypical QB size/Manning, Baker is almost identical to Case on Combine measurements. If rebuilding o-line for size-style QB,  wouldn't it make sense?

9312 2018-04-26 02:47:42 - Change your pillow case as often as possible.
- don’t waste money on clean and clear that shit does NOTHING (it’s better to buy something a bit more expensive as long as it works) 
- try using coconut oil as a makeup remover instead of other brand products

9313 2018-04-26 02:47:10 Gonna burn the midnight oil in the studio tonight. Got a lot on my mind and in my heart
9314 2018-04-26 02:46:56 Athabasca Oil Corp is the only name I own from that list, which I started buying in 2017 and adding gradually until Jan. of this year. I like $ATH.to because of their mixed thermal/light, infrastructure, Statoil & Murphy deal, strong growth, management, plus leverage, potential.

"Is it okay for me to be here? "
9316 2018-04-26 02:46:54 This is how much America and seemingly the world hates Trump.

9325 2018-04-26 02:45:13 After conversions between gal-lts and usd-mxn, price in here is $3.91/gal

What's happening? A limited resource, oil, is over time becoming scarce and rarer, thus pricier. Free market doesn't apply because our need for fuel overrides any cut in demand; you gotta buy it.
9326 2018-04-26 02:45:03 Not sure if it was in oil or just slimy
9327 2018-04-26 02:45:01 The recession and the drop in oil prices played a huge role, not to mention Chavez's haphazard approach to social reform. If you're arguing a corrupt, incompetent gvmt is just as bad as none, I agree.

Maybe we can find the sweet spot btwn Somalia & Venezuela?

9329 2018-04-26 02:44:40 I'm hoping this is a set-up, where perhaps hundreds of women walk out and surround them (so they squirm To Catch A Predator-style) and then douse the floor around the "guests" in vegetable oil. I'd watch just to see every man literally fall.

9346 2018-04-26 02:42:47 I mix it with tea tree oil & spray it on my face. Or just dab it with a cotton ball.
9347 2018-04-26 02:42:29 Okay, I love beautiful cards and artwork. I have some of my original art at J.C. Morgan @ArtJcmorgan in Oxford Alabama. Lovely oil paintings and collage art too can be found there by me. Go check them out on facebook or in person. Thanks, ginasart

9352 2018-04-26 02:41:53 Trade deal between U.K. and Nigeria! This a lame game. I’m just wondering what the deal entails. Let me guess, I think oil might be involved and agriculture too. Jokers!!! Economic imbalance btw both countries cannot allow a fair deal! Start with African countries!!!! #getpvc
9353 2018-04-26 02:41:48 How about we make a trade Gardiner to Oil for Lucic
9354 2018-04-26 02:41:43 I finally had to ask my mom to send money so I can get an oil change I'm 1000 miles over due for. I love being alive 
9355 2018-04-26 02:41:22 
9356 2018-04-26 02:40:59 There's bigger political issues out there, however. 
The US government is violating international laws by bombing Syria all because of an oil pipeline and their nation-building tactics to take down the Assad regime.
9357 2018-04-26 02:40:57 Watching The Looming Tower reminds me that no one has ever paid for the World Trade Center attacks. The US Government is a farse. It allows Saudi Arabia a free pass. Oil? The British also are also to blame. Not for the attacks but for proof of terror funding.
9358 2018-04-26 02:40:30 And they talk shit about my car when they have never done an oil change in their pathetic lives

9364 2018-04-26 02:40:00 It gladdens me that a certain rapist charlatan has been put away for life.

The sort of religiosity he sold though, is readily consumed by the same urbanites praising his arrest, from more sophisticated peddlers of snake oil. Do not trust anyone who thinks Asaram was an anomaly.
9365 2018-04-26 02:39:59 These are the Christians who will support ISIS terrorists to kill middle easterners for oil and money, and for not being white enough, while seated at the United Nations and blame Luciferians.

9370 2018-04-26 02:39:14 Top of my already-shitty day with a huge fire in my kitchen (yay oil; put it out with the extinguisher), and now not only is my dinner toast, but my apartment is filled with smoke, so the pups and I have to sit outside. :-\ This is NOT my day. :(
9371 2018-04-26 02:39:13 Agreed.  We won't be able to enjoy these moments long.  That team is good.  Way better than our Oil.

9373 2018-04-26 02:38:44 You all realize yhat the conservatives over the last 30 years or more turned a bolnd eye on the oil sands and nevet helped to clean up the way it was extracted. So lady if you feel that scared sbout oil plastic or anything else that had to do with oil.Make sure you get ride of it

9375 2018-04-26 02:38:26 Did you see the US oil tankers during your flight?  I gather they are super safe!  Better than ours.
9376 2018-04-26 02:38:08 Oil arrogance and oil money black mail to pressure the university to back down. Threats to withhold grants and gifts, big ones too. Hope the university does not gave in to the threats. Sounds like nasty ploys South of our border.
9377 2018-04-26 02:37:57 No joke - a little @aveda shampure composition oil on my wrists, and I'm calmer - and everything smells so much better. Thanks, Aveda. For the first time in weeks, the world smells good to me.  This is my kind of therapy.

9388 2018-04-26 02:36:19 demoncrats are up to no good again,they are raising  gas prices,and telling stupid liberal, it's cause winter to summer mix and oil price going up,last I remember before election oil was double and gas prices going down.

9390 2018-04-26 02:36:12 The Facebook TV spot during the NBA playoffs was so cringe and disingenuous - talk about fake pandering due to poor public image. Reminds me of the BP campaign that ran for years after the oil spill. Just - no @facebook.

9411 2018-04-26 02:33:12 So first the State went after Big tobacco. And tobacco went along with it and got hammered

Now they are after big Oil. And Oil tries to compromise and will lose. 

Gee I wonder why the NRA is holding firm? They see what happens when you give one inch.
9412 2018-04-26 02:33:08 Have you tried a hair mask? The macadamia oil one once a week for like an hour or twice for 30 mins will help! Biotin, masks, and no bleach is what helped mine grow as long as my sisters only mine is healthier than hers

9428 2018-04-26 02:30:08 Is that right? I work in the oil industry and I’m in favour of all the pipelines u cited but that isn’t enough for u. I must also lick Harper’s boots. I’m centre-right too and have no use for Trudeau. But, in your astuteness, you call me a Liberal anyway. I know who the loser is.

9433 2018-04-26 02:29:47 I definitely do! I was telling my mom I wanted to get an oil diffuser thing from the Monq site and literally my fb timeline and instagram timeline has been full of Monq ads. Then I got a bunch from my yahoo account. Its quite creepy actually

9437 2018-04-26 02:29:12 Wrong comrade.  You have bought the lies and the snake oil.  Trump loves the undeducated, and you're a perfect example.
9438 2018-04-26 02:29:01 Again, you are trying to change the subject away from the fact that oil caused Alberta's economy to tank and caused massive unemployment. Canada wants to move to economic diversity and #RenewableEnergy. Take off your blinders. #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM #ProtectTheInlet
9439 2018-04-26 02:28:55 My hair extremely soft too, I started putting coconut oil in it everyday and it did it’s own thing. You have to be consistent with the products
9440 2018-04-26 02:28:38 I hope Ford kept the lessons of the oil crisis in mind when deciding to axe all their cars. Pretty precarious perch to be on if the SUV market tanks. You can’t just reenter the sedan market overnight
9441 2018-04-26 02:28:37 I’m allergic to coconut oil it makes me break out in hives
9442 2018-04-26 02:28:29 And all of that oil, no....thank...you, right?
9443 2018-04-26 02:28:12 If you ever want to know why I absolutely detest my mother just remember that I told her using tea tree oil is bad for jake and she said well I’m not going to stop using it bc of him

9448 2018-04-26 02:26:51 That's because in the 1950s you could work on a car yourself. Now you can't do an oil change without a graduate degree. This is a stupid wrongheaded pander to dumb people that want to do jobs they're not qualified to do.
9449 2018-04-26 02:26:18 If president obama would have done even an ounce of what traitor trump has done he would have been impeached by the GRAND OIL PARTY.
9450 2018-04-26 02:26:05 Not really sure if this’ll help your problem, but hey, I’m in the mood for giving unsolicited advice: try using oil pastels to stop the watercolors from bleeding.
9451 2018-04-26 02:25:56 Use olive oil as a conditioner by leaving it warmed up on your hair for 15 minutes before shampoo.
9452 2018-04-26 02:25:36 I need more coconut oil  
But I know if I tell my mama get it she gonna look at the price and tell me come get my own shyt. 
9453 2018-04-26 02:25:31 no offense but if you paid $60 for the fenty body lava instead of mixing together a cheap body oil and highlighter from the drugstore, bitch........
9454 2018-04-26 02:25:27 indeed ! Your local Christ as the answer to that mystery as well media sources. Won't tell us about the secret sueing of big oil. For their climate change agenda.  yes done. These jackasses pulling in money hand over fist

9459 2018-04-26 02:24:47 Not real sure how any Leafs fan can view this as a heartbreak. They had no business being in a Gm7 & gave up 7 goals in the finale. The clock struck midnight. Great season & now it's up to mgmt to improve the roster.
9460 2018-04-26 02:24:36 Don’t get me wrong, I’d love to do oil so I can go over mistakes but my apt is too small and I don’t have enough ventilation 
9461 2018-04-26 02:24:33 Oil well fires are shut off with a dynamite (it removes all the oxygen)
9462 2018-04-26 02:24:25 Trying to change the subject? Just proves that you and Conservatives want to stay in the past and rely on fossil fuels and oil instead of tackling #climatechange and moving toward #RenewableEnergy and economic diversity.

9467 2018-04-26 02:22:51 I'm no where near ready to have children. Maybe in 7-10 years I will? But when I do, I will tell them the tales of the elephant and his acolytes. Hopefully we will all still be here then so I can show them how we fight narratives while taking moolah from MMs who don't need it :)
9468 2018-04-26 02:22:36 I did it a long time ago when I was a kid...ewww I can still taste it....like car oil and lard....
9469 2018-04-26 02:22:36 As long as my scalp gets water I only oil it on wash days. In desperate measures, blue magic hair grease works wonders lol.

9481 2018-04-26 02:20:26 What part of diversification do you not understand? Alberta put too many eggs into one basket and is now crying the blues blaming everyone else for its problems. Take blinders off oil and seek other revenue streams. Or quit whinning.
9482 2018-04-26 02:20:18 This is America if you want to make ends meet. We’re not in oil but my husband has always traveled a lot. It’s just the way it is.
9483 2018-04-26 02:20:11 Oh come on, man. You know we call these “business/growth/job-creating incentives” when we are talking about the OIL industry.

9501 2018-04-26 02:18:30 They are in a similar situation to the Oilers. Don't have a true #1 & would benefit greatly from adding a pair of legit #2-#4 blueliners. Difference being Leafs still have movable assets to make it happen.

9520 2018-04-26 02:15:05 As Arte Johnson would have said, "very interesting." It's always been one of those broad generalizations that "high" oil prices tend to become a burden on the economy. Interesting to see that is not always, the case, but certainly can be..
9521 2018-04-26 02:15:02 Soooooo no big deal or anything but I almost have every single dōTERRA essential oil...... blends included
9522 2018-04-26 02:14:51 Kapanen and a pick for Tanev would make a huge difference.
9523 2018-04-26 02:14:44 These prices are not representative of a free market. Prices are controlled by the Oil industry like Dimond prices are by a syndicate. Supply & demand cannot exist when one group sets all the prices. Oil prices go down as gas prices rise > Oil prices go up and gas prices rise.
9524 2018-04-26 02:14:32 GREAT SEX TIP: Never use an essential oil.
9525 2018-04-26 02:14:28 Perhaps progesterone in oil capsules? That might actually help prevent a miscarriage. But, you know, see a REAL DOCTOR for medical advice.
9526 2018-04-26 02:14:26 Truth will rise above falsehood as oil above water in #BogusCaseOnAsaramBapuji against Asaram Bapu Ji
9527 2018-04-26 02:13:53 Looks like 57% of their oil is hedged at $52.48/barrel FY2018.  Not something to celebrate. That's embarrassing and a reason why they lost money again
9528 2018-04-26 02:13:37 Other recent data also suggests rail from AB into WA State. I personally witness 110-unit BNSF oil tanker trains, which I suspect are from Bakken Basin. Very complex trying to fit pieces all together as matter is *dynamic*.
9529 2018-04-26 02:13:26 Had a congested nose once, went to @cvspharmacy to find some sort of nasal spray remedy, bought one without much investigation. Few days later I thought “this isn’t working” and read the label details to find “homeopathic remedy” in the fine print. CVS sells snake oil, who knew?
9530 2018-04-26 02:13:13 crude slates; "Crude slate" is the industry term for the list (slate) of all types of crude oil processed by a refinery.
9531 2018-04-26 02:13:13 I’m fr obsessed with the smell of tea tree oil 
9532 2018-04-26 02:13:05 Anyone who knows me knows I can’t stand my hair being oily and yesterday was my coconut oil day and it’s still so oily and it makes me feel gross 
9533 2018-04-26 02:12:55 Will be interested to see what the Maple Leafs do with this come next season. Should be a solid tool to grow from but we shall see. No question that the time to actually upgrade their backend is at hand.

9538 2018-04-26 02:12:26 Yeah and oil diffusers
9539 2018-04-26 02:12:25 you need to add butter and oil to it. (Hot cooking oil and melted butter) make it thick enough to make pancakes fluffy but thin enough to have a consistent flow.

9541 2018-04-26 02:12:04 Trumps primary mission continues to be to dismantle anything that has the label: “Obama era”.  Forcing California and the states which follow CA standards to change their CAFE goals is not about safety, it is only about oil lobbyists period. Auto Ind. thriving, in spite of CAFE
9542 2018-04-26 02:11:59 I am not looking for dictators. I do not care about the situation in Syria. Do you really think modern countries care about oil? The US makes no money on oil. Russia makes 50% of its state revenue from oil.

9551 2018-04-26 02:10:36 I’m on a diet so I use oil and vinegar.
9552 2018-04-26 02:10:34 Remember when Harper destroyed scientist's records to protect oil industry?

9556 2018-04-26 02:10:03 You dope. Solar City doesn’t exist anymore. It’s part of Tesla and receives less subsidy than the oil and gas companies. Also we don’t have to spend blood and treasure to defend our sunshine.

9573 2018-04-26 02:07:28 olive oil gel only works on freshly washed hair for me.. other than it, trash.
9574 2018-04-26 02:07:27 tax cut gave the oil companies the right to raise prices? $3.00 per gallon? just heard US is now leading oil producer in the world? So why are prices so high? Why has domestic steel prices gone up when the tariff was designed to aid domestic steel producers?
9575 2018-04-26 02:07:15 It's simply about reprioritizing where we put our money. We're spending $20 billion+/yr to subsidize oil drilling + External costs of a fossil fuel economy far exceed the investment it would take to transform our economy based on sustainability rather than short-term profits.
9576 2018-04-26 02:07:05 Wow, if I use my face as a watercolour pallete, it'll turn into oil paint

9579 2018-04-26 02:06:44 It is! I kind of just sprinkle seeds/cranberries over the sprouts and add avocado. For the dressing I use fresh lemon juice, Dijon mustard, drizzle of olive oil and salt/pepper. So good and super quick!

9587 2018-04-26 02:05:38 I wish teenage me could have gotten advice like that. Shaving was a painful ritual for me every day for years. I tried different creams and blades but jojoba oil is not something men in Ohio would suggest in the 90s. Everyone just said to tough my way through it.

Oooh, stories? Tell him everything! Can you believe his DUM-E made yet /another/ mess at the lab just a few days ago? Spilled coffee and oil and dropped pretty much every tool at the work table. How useless can a robot get?
9590 2018-04-26 02:05:25 The local "alternative" paper here is owned by a corp chiefly owned by a young rich guy whose family owns a big oil-and-chemical company. Its real purpose: selling ads, true-believing journos used as props; window dressing. Gotta love it.

9593 2018-04-26 02:04:29 The Old Testament violence and creation of enemies to be smited and oil to be poured on heads to mock the enemies continues to repel me. I thought you were, like, into the “good news”. ....

9597 2018-04-26 02:04:01 I use one from Sally’s with tea tree oil because I’m lazy as fuck and it lets me go 5 days in between washes.
9598 2018-04-26 02:03:47 Can you tell the difference in veggie oil vs just oil?
9599 2018-04-26 02:03:24 The title is arguable, the content of the article is interesting in particular touching on the ethics of present and future usage of data. Until #BigData and #AI are fully dominant and integrated, the most valuable resource will be oil especially with its geopolitical aspects.
9600 2018-04-26 02:03:10 Coconut oil has saved my life and lips on multiple occasions. But tonight i got a little carried away and it is NOT GOOD FOR THE EYEBALL. 
9601 2018-04-26 02:03:07 We had oil, we had gold. I actually wonder, why nobody calls #data the new coal. Something is clearly wrong with coal. Or cotton, which would be more appropriate anyway, given that data is mostly produced by unpaid creators.
9602 2018-04-26 02:02:55 Who am i? I am a mother, a teacher, a critic, ceo of the house , a role model for my kids (hopefully), or right and a wife too . Lets see what else. A doctor (who fixes everything with oil ), a driver, i can go on

9616 2018-04-26 02:00:44 No offense to Wyndham, I would have preferred Valvoline Motor Oil or New Glarus Brewery as the sponsor. If it was the brewery, I wonder what would the reaction of seeing Spotted Cow or Fat Squirrel on the front hood.
9617 2018-04-26 02:00:39 "Dad, can you teach me how to shave?"

"Sure, son. First you lather up, and be sure to use a pre-shave oil. Apply the shaving cream, and begin to lightly but firmly hold the razor. Then cut yourself so deep the bleeding just will not stop, and switch to the electric in shame."

9633 2018-04-26 01:58:36 I grew up in the hood, my family nearly fell apart b/c of the bust in American oil industry, and I worked for 20 years to get the career I wanted. I volunteered for Kasich in 2016, saw him on working in the office with underlings, and he's not my idol. But hey...strawman.
9634 2018-04-26 01:58:35 I felt old today. Spent all day bitching and complaining only to go home to do the dishes, clean the house, change my oil and do my laundry and actually enjoy it..... what the hell happen to me 
9635 2018-04-26 01:58:28 I’ve been listening to “you look like a crack pipe shined with Baby Oil” 
9636 2018-04-26 01:58:02 Jon, after the last 3 games how on earth can a professional basketball team keep making the same backbreaking mistake? Its like a mechanic that chronically strips your oil pan nut. Come on guys
9637 2018-04-26 01:57:48 Target going out of business has more to do with Amazon than Alberta oil. Foreign investment fleeing our energy sector is the result of a successful campaign by orgs like Tides to convince Canadians our oil is the dirtiest. We have the largest stable reserves in the world.
9638 2018-04-26 01:57:48 I promise to rub your feet once a week with Argan oil if you promise to rub my back once a week with coconut oil. #ModernWeddingVows
9639 2018-04-26 01:57:47 One thing i find remarkable about this #data as the new oil/gold are: mining rights. Seems to be some polticians wet dreams about a future where individuals are mined for their data by companies, who pay well for their mining licenses?

9644 2018-04-26 01:56:36 Before bed rub coconut oil on your hands, use a lot in your cuticles, then put on cotton gloves overnight. Works like a charm every time for me.
9645 2018-04-26 01:56:32 No, because we know the carbon bubble is already breaking and it is not our economy that is now dependent on oil money.
9646 2018-04-26 01:56:20 The engine start mixing oil/water and we didn’t wanna waste money on a new one cause something else major prolly would’ve broke too
9647 2018-04-26 01:55:56 He’s running the game for trump and Putin to profit on oil
9648 2018-04-26 01:55:52 If you still eat palm oil, my favourite accidentally vegan food is the “compliments” brand of cinnamon rolls from sobeys/freshco (maybe metro?)
9649 2018-04-26 01:55:40 When I deep condition... I DEEP condition... 2 different types of deep conditioning treatments with a regular conditioner over night and then add a little oil in the morning and under the dryer for 10 minutes. Rinse with cold water. Its excessive but it works.
9650 2018-04-26 01:55:38 Actually it is the truth The conservatives in Alberta spent 45 years in power mishandling their oil wealth and their mismanagement of the economy caused their province to suffer when oil took a hit, That is the truth, accept it. #abpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM #ProtectTheInlet
9651 2018-04-26 01:55:34 My aunt smelled the Wild Growth Oil I used to oil my scalp. Asked why I smelled like an old woman. Told her it was hair oil, she proceeds to tell me I’m not smelling Vegas sexy, and to air that shit out before I leave.
9652 2018-04-26 01:55:25 Giv'em heck Dan.! I've been told during my lifetime that ignorance is bliss.

9653 2018-04-26 01:55:25 So you think shipping oil across the ocean in giant tankers that burn the dirtiest, barely regulated fuel is a better alternative? Especially from countries that have far lower; environmental standards, human & labor rights, and also could be linked to terrorism? That's better?

9677 2018-04-26 01:50:54 When and where do you want to Pirate? Hint. I am not flying to Japan. Much less stealing a ship, growing a wooden leg (stem cells?) And riding the oceans under a skull and crossbones. 

Well. Maybe an oil tanker.  Cause what would be more fun than raiding sea ports for oil? ;)
9678 2018-04-26 01:50:52 Great blog.  I'm still interested in the secret sauce- burning oil for energy and the incorporation of diesel technology into these power units.  I don't think trucking COs will want to buy both DEF and Super Syrup- so why is this not okay, too?

9690 2018-04-26 01:49:01 Yeah, right. We do the same except we use our Armed Forces and their blood to secure the invaded country for the corporations to take the oil and steal the minerals.
9691 2018-04-26 01:48:41 my hair has grown over 10 inches since my senior year of hs  I would like to thank God, coconut oil, and black castor oil for this blessing
9692 2018-04-26 01:48:30 I had a bit of an argument with @EcoverUK a while ago as their washing up liquid contained whey, going totally against their ethos. I called them out on it....nothing but excuses saying how great it is. They also don't understand what "sustainable palm oil" actually is.

9696 2018-04-26 01:46:42 Sometimes you just need a vacation from stocks.

When Andrew Carnegie's oil investment was going no where, he sold a portion for a 77% loss. He couldn't sell the rest, so he went to England for vacation. During his absence the co. struck oil. It eventually became a 45x bagger.
9697 2018-04-26 01:46:19 Greater funding for coconut oil please.

9706 2018-04-26 01:45:29 Hi! No, actually it’s a traditional dish we eat whenever we make it for dinner. Some of the ingredients are coconut, chili oil, garlic and tum yum paste! It’s delicious!!
9707 2018-04-26 01:45:09 THIS CAR STINKS LIKE OIL. BETTER TRY TO FIX IT WITH MY FARTS AND ASS STANK. *moans involentarily*
9708 2018-04-26 01:44:50 The world would be a better place if we swapped, ironically, the people they look down on have more logic and a good heart; money is not my god but it is theirs, i'd take the hit for national pride n respect, they would rob an entire country of oil n get the rest of us targeted.
9709 2018-04-26 01:44:48 Blue mountain state oil change?
9710 2018-04-26 01:44:48 I was worried about that but I think there is still plenty. I mean you just showed a supercharger removal and oil change. Plus now I know how to get to that alternator on a mini , just in case
9711 2018-04-26 01:44:39 Government policy r only to mop treasury & vote bank, policy has nothing to do with common mans plight, crude oil price were low so government increase excise duty 2 mop up their coffer & #IMF thinks its a good policy??? #IMF is loseing it face as a responsible intntl agency

9722 2018-04-26 01:42:58 Just the other day I was marinating some chicken breasts and instead of grabbing the oil, I grabbed pinesol and ruined it!  I was so mad!!! LOL  Threw it all out!  My fault for rushing! #NoNakedChicken
9723 2018-04-26 01:42:57 olive oil has a very low smoke point - this is a major error
9724 2018-04-26 01:42:51 The oil runs off. Oil and eggs don't mix that well.
9725 2018-04-26 01:42:50 I went to get my moms oil changed and the dude gave me a discount and asked for my Snapchat 
9726 2018-04-26 01:42:37 I put way too many essential oil drops in the diffuser bc I wanted it to smell extra good, but now William is passing out bc of how strong it is.  omg what have I done

9736 2018-04-26 01:40:57 I like when VP Cheney had stock options with Halliburton, the only company allowed to bid for oil field services in Iraq, yet liberal/conservative turn a blind eye, claiming Iraq was carried out because of “legitimate” concerns. Obvi!
9737 2018-04-26 01:40:57 Big containers of ice cream, lots of pasta, pizza, sugar. *do not follow this diet* ;) I try to eat foods that are high in the good omegas. Salmon (or fish once a week), walnuts......flax oil. You can find lists online.
9738 2018-04-26 01:40:52 The recent research makes it clear the behaviour of dilbit is essentially the same as any other heavy oil. This means that the research on spill response for heavy oil is completely applicable. The RSC didn't know this at the time. We now know this to be the case. #bcpoli

9746 2018-04-26 01:39:48 Tried to be the nice kid, got ignored and passed over for any opportunities that were out there because I was being polite.
Fuck that, the squeaky wheel gets the oil.
9747 2018-04-26 01:39:43 So much action on twitter today that I forgot to do an oil change!!!
9748 2018-04-26 01:39:33 And 18 months ago, when oil was 40$/barrel, gas prices weren't lowered, with the excuse that oil had already been purchased at higher prices. By that argument, we should be paying lower gas prices today, with reserve from 40$ barrels. Right .....

9760 2018-04-26 01:38:18 My dog is so bored and hyper but walking in the rain stresses him out because he hates getting wet. I’m currently drowning the apartment with chamomile essential oil and playing classical music to calm his ass down. His anxiety is giving me anxiety.
9761 2018-04-26 01:37:40 lol people freak when they see that much oil in the pan, even though virtually none of it ends up on their plate
9762 2018-04-26 01:37:32 Peppermint oil being organic should have an expiry date on the container when you buy it. Just replace it when expire date is up.
9763 2018-04-26 01:37:25 Who voted for a moral compass, in a snake oil show you take a given!; )
9764 2018-04-26 01:37:20 Well Espio.

If you really must know. I went on this really fucking long and boring mission to blow up literally all of Eggman's oil production to stop the production and repair of the giant roving bands of robots occupying most of the planet.

But things happened.
9765 2018-04-26 01:37:13 Oil companies, remember:  when gas spiked to $4.50/gal under the Bush 43 admin, the free market started giving us ELECTRIC CAR options.  God Bless America.
9766 2018-04-26 01:37:11 For shiny hair, mix one egg with a olive oil and apply to your hair. Leave it on for 20-30 minutes then shower.

9769 2018-04-26 01:36:41 No it won't. A lot of us are leaving! Bye! There are oil jobs that need us outside Canada. Get your shit together and we might come back.
9770 2018-04-26 01:36:32 I love the citrus tang! Perfect complement to the chili oil.

9777 2018-04-26 01:35:25 Nah, if you get one you get the other too. See, they’re best friends. I put them both to work tending my garden. Someone has to keep those squirrels off my crops...and we all know my little girl (dog) is slacking at it. They’re paid in black gold...not oil...rich organic soil.
9778 2018-04-26 01:35:06 Get oil and gas in check

9784 2018-04-26 01:34:43 Using oil right now. But prefer balm. It ends up getting absorbed into my beard and skin. The second being way more important at stopping dry skin
9785 2018-04-26 01:34:30 I thought it was interesting that oil was at a generational high just as both the 2000 and 2008 crash were about to get really bad.

Not saying that's happening now (obviously).
9786 2018-04-26 01:34:26 Oh god no! You need a paper towel to drain, and that way, the bottom gets brown and hard, and the top not done enough. And if you splash oil on top, the egg tastes like oil not egg.

9798 2018-04-26 01:32:18 Vinegar and oil are essential on some of the salads that I eat.
I like breathing ergo I treat my asthma as directed by my actual real medical school graduate westernized doctor.

I despise homeopathy and their bogus claims.
9799 2018-04-26 01:32:18 -yawn-  Nice try, kiddoski. Now that it's on your guy you suddenly like the concept & try to make it look like that was your position all along? 

Yeah, fortunately most people are honest enough & intelligent enough not to buy that kind of rancid snake oil. }:)

9802 2018-04-26 01:31:35 And some gentleman tweeted that Canada lost 40M on the W Coast today because of the libs and the oil industry problems. 40M could have bolstered our economy
9803 2018-04-26 01:31:30 Then affordable housing on the way. But I seriously doubt the motive of head of BoC #poloz. Even rising oil prices did not motivate him in last meeting.
9804 2018-04-26 01:31:26 Meant to say cannabis oil.

9810 2018-04-26 01:31:03 Whenever I oil up/moisturize on a hot day I feel like a bush baked bean
9811 2018-04-26 01:31:00 I think it’d be tough carrying peppermint oil in my kit. I try to stick with non-liquids/stuff that doesn’t expire if at all possible, except for the real emergency stuff.
9812 2018-04-26 01:30:59 yo man why the fuck did i just find out that putting on coconut oil before shaving makes your legs feel smooth af!? WHEN I LIVE FOR COCONUT OIL!
9813 2018-04-26 01:30:53 $110 on a face oil? Unless it promises I will look 10 years younger and be soft as a baby's bottom with invisible pores and no blemishes for at least 6 months! Sorry...old school Olay user since my 20s.
9814 2018-04-26 01:30:48 Think also of all the lives we'd save by not going to war over gas/oil.

9817 2018-04-26 01:30:44 Holy f@$#! It is! I see the handle now. Okay,....more than two words now. Coat it with vegetable oil and bake in the oven on the highest setting to season. Then when you cook with it don't use dish soap, just water to clean. It'll change your life forever.

9821 2018-04-26 01:30:21 Technically, hops are flowers, to that is, effectively, a bottle of diluted flower oil.
As opposed to deluded flowers.

9824 2018-04-26 01:29:45 disliking Oil Ocean in Mania is for small brains
9825 2018-04-26 01:29:45 some long distance relationship work Hanne , think how military service partners or oil worker feel about it pretty much the same: sad, miserable, depressed 
Your friends are your shoulder lean on them.
Describing how much you feel and hurt is always the toughest. Your not alone
9826 2018-04-26 01:29:35 Lol damn  I'm glad us oil city guys all feel the same way about it Williams
9827 2018-04-26 01:29:08 Beard Balm and Beard oil? Or jut one? Experimenting shall be commencing in the near future.
9828 2018-04-26 01:29:07 Many #oil mgmt teams have hedged 20-30% of 2018 production in the low $50s #WTI--not a big deal unless WTI goes to $75 and then hedging losses start to make a difference...and it looks like its going there
9829 2018-04-26 01:29:06 Oil Ocean is lit!
9830 2018-04-26 01:28:37 Bones don’t turn into oil... so y’all keep believing this bs the government telling yall
9831 2018-04-26 01:28:28 Wish our President would do something to get the OIL PRICES LOWER SO THAT MILLION OF AMERICANS DONT HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN GAS MEDICINE OR FOOD.
9832 2018-04-26 01:28:20 Don't give up your day job, selling bone broth and snake oil.
9833 2018-04-26 01:28:14 But Oil Ocean is good
However replace "Sonic Mania" and "Oil Ocean" with "S3&K" and "Carnival Night" and you got a tweet
9834 2018-04-26 01:28:11 Peaches. Sliced, tossed lightly with olive oil, grilled and then lightly salted and peppered.
9835 2018-04-26 01:28:07 The economy was fragile due oil price fall, ND TSA mopped over 2Trillion naira from the banks. 

Which over 400k jobs was lost from the bank, ND within 2015 to 2016 over 3.5million jobs was lost, curtsey of d physical ND Monterey policies FX Inconstency, ND U mention BKharam.
9836 2018-04-26 01:28:06 @5YAHlR Hi Syahir, what say you about steady pump prices amidst a global uptick in oil prices?

9841 2018-04-26 01:27:26 Oil is sold st a discount to the US.... and if Alberta has gasolineshipped on a pipeline from the US or trucked then Alberta will pay more
9842 2018-04-26 01:27:21 Ok ur job today is understanding about oil & gas . Tgh dia explain mata aku dh berair tahan ngantuk blom pon mula lagi.
9843 2018-04-26 01:27:07 African black soap or Simple as a cleanser, raw Shea butter as a mosturizer, and Ponds cream before my make up. Also use tea tree oil and do charcoal masks often
9844 2018-04-26 01:26:58 How old are you and you probably don't know how to change a tire or the oil in a car.
9845 2018-04-26 01:26:45 The difference is the federal government isn't trying to transition or change our oil sector into another renewable energy generator, they're trying to destroy it outright.

Yet, they have no problem importing oil from countries with horrendous human rights abuses.
9846 2018-04-26 01:26:42 I used to get them bad & peppermint oil seemed to be the only thing that helped, I rubbed it on my temples and wrist 
9847 2018-04-26 01:26:39 She used to be.....but she's fallen under the sway of "big oil" and lost her way, amid the Jason Kenny onslaught....#bcpoli
9848 2018-04-26 01:26:11 Mix 4 tbsp of flour, 4 tbsp of sugar, 2 tbsp of oil, 2 tbsp of cocoa powder, 2 tbsp of water, and 1/4 teaspoon of salt in a mug and microwave it for one minute and you got yourself a vegan mug brownie woot woot
9849 2018-04-26 01:26:10 I lost part of my oil burner and I need to burn some eucalyptus oil 
9850 2018-04-26 01:26:09 Senioritis is really hitting I can’t even form sentences about Florida’s crude oil and idk what the fuck 8x8 is
9851 2018-04-26 01:25:49 The tick twisters work great, especially with peppermint oil first, and are half the price for us poor people! I have not tried Steve's cool lasso thingamajig but it looks interesting too.
9852 2018-04-26 01:25:20 I spent $70 on oil and oil filter I’m highly annoyed 
9853 2018-04-26 01:25:15 Conservatives: lol Liberal snowflakes can’t handle free speech and opinion 

Also Conservatives:YOU CANT CRITICIZE ABOUT ALBERTAS OIL!!  TAKE AWAY HIS HONORARY DEGREES NOW and BEAT HIM UP

9862 2018-04-26 01:23:56 they carry almost as much oil as blood
9863 2018-04-26 01:23:39 Energy in Depth is funded by the El Paso Corporation, Occidental Petroleum, BP, Anadarko, Marathon, EnCana, Chevron, Talisman, Shell, API, the Independent Petroleum Association of America, Halliburton, Schlumberger and the Ohio Oil and Gas Association. Okey Doke.
9864 2018-04-26 01:23:34 Ah, man. Those are such good cars, too. I'm angry. This is 1000000000% the wrong move and will probably bite Ford when oil/gas prices shoot back up. :( Glad you got one, though. Such good cars.

Do ya thang! 
9867 2018-04-26 01:23:13 Hmmm... an echo of Mobil Oil sponsoring the arrival of Upstairs Downstairs to PBS in the mid-70s?
9868 2018-04-26 01:23:13 I used coconut shampoo and conditioner. Coconut body bar. Coconut lavender deodorant. And coconut oil pulled. You can say I’m feeling pretty tropical tonight.
9869 2018-04-26 01:23:04 Omega Ora builder I put basic knowledge of machinery I didn't think they would be clingy to test males sexuality but they do and have for awhile your relaxation, oil change it has dookie you rushed be ready
9870 2018-04-26 01:22:58 I use polychromos, they’re oil based and a heck of a lot sturdier than the wax pencils!

9872 2018-04-26 01:22:44 Could this potentially disrupt the bullish oil trend?
9873 2018-04-26 01:22:36 my right tire pressure dropped to 12, I now need an oil change, and my engine light just turned on.. this happened all in the SAME day! 
dad, I need you and I wish I was home! 
9874 2018-04-26 01:22:34 Clothes and boots soaked in rain and oil 
9875 2018-04-26 01:22:33 What if i said oil will never run out and synthetic oils are always being recycled and cleaned 
9876 2018-04-26 01:22:33 peppermint essential oil makes my period cramps go away in seconds. it’s a blessing
9877 2018-04-26 01:22:27 TIck twisters work really well but I'm not sure about for pups. Peppermint oil applied directly will either get the tick to release or kill it which makes for easier removal. It also aids in healing and reduces the severity of reaction to the bite. I swear by the stuff!
9878 2018-04-26 01:22:25 .@cathmckenna @ec_minister Billions of OIL petro dollars at stake and we are still sparring about PLANTS; they inhale Co2  They Exhale Oxygen.

You are killing the economy
9879 2018-04-26 01:22:11 ジジババや子供の自撮り、特にこれからは水着なんかで肌の露出増えた写真が出回る季節だけど、そういういろんな年代の性的嗜好者のサイトで貼られることも考えて晒してるのかな？って思うことがある。どんな年齢だろうがデブスだろうが需要はあるところにはあるからね。
9880 2018-04-26 01:21:55 It's about time the GG steps in, @gmbutts @JustinTrudeau are traitors to Canada. This bullshit needs to end, the Libtards will make sure they destroy Canada before we know it. How many $$ are they getting from these radical anti oil organizations?  #liberalssuck #albertawantsout
9881 2018-04-26 01:21:51 There needs to be an essential oil in the smell of new shoes. Cussss I'd sniff that all day lmao
9882 2018-04-26 01:21:42 all jojos carry enough oil to slick up themselves for a month
9883 2018-04-26 01:21:31 I bought the verb ghost shampoo, conditioner and oil. I cannot wait to try it
9884 2018-04-26 01:21:14 This coconut oil shit better work on my face 
9885 2018-04-26 01:21:05 Im guessing thats not in oil rig country... 

The water at most beaches in LA stays around 54-65 year round. Tarballs are always scattered on the beach. Some look like lava rock then smell like fuel. Its gross.
9886 2018-04-26 01:21:05 a2 some faves are tandoori sauce, butter chicken, teriyaki too. also I like to roast it with citrus fruit inside and just season it on the outside with garlic, olive oil, salt/pepper #nonakedchicken

9892 2018-04-26 01:19:19 A2: I love a smokey BBQ sauce or a rub with olive oil and pesto. #NoNakedChicken
9893 2018-04-26 01:19:17 Edibles. There's so many different kinds. You can also get them in different doses of that makes sense. There's also CBD oil but it doesn't have thc but there is oils that's thc

9896 2018-04-26 01:18:25 Bro I swear I need a new oil Plug. The one I have takes his sweet ass time to reply.
9897 2018-04-26 01:18:21 I already did and they offered refund, but would not help compensate for deeply oil stained concrete on my front porch and in my garage
9898 2018-04-26 01:18:05 That has got to be the worst fried eggs ever...  just a little bit of oil, half heat and cover with foil till done, far better and without the burnt edges
9899 2018-04-26 01:18:01 Lucas oil detailer para interiores ! Lo venden en autozone, o simplemente trapo húmedo :)
9900 2018-04-26 01:17:56 I chose Zinke because he wants to allow the raping of our protected lands , once they’re gouged for oil and minerals that’s it!
9901 2018-04-26 01:17:52 I'm fairly certain if the gen pop used body wash with tea tree oil to wash their pits we'd have a lot less stank in the world
9902 2018-04-26 01:17:48 @realDonaldTrump Why am I paying almost $4 a gallon for gas? You need to do something with OPEC and these rising oil prices.#MAGA
9903 2018-04-26 01:17:45 I need my car cleaned, washed and i an oil change so bad
9904 2018-04-26 01:17:09 Sorry but I don't like my fried eggs swimming in oil. Gross.
9905 2018-04-26 01:16:21 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
9906 2018-04-26 01:16:02 Nothing annoys people more than a door to door salesman trying to sell you snake oil.
9907 2018-04-26 01:15:46 tea tree oil 2-3 times a day, it helped mine on my rook piercing
9908 2018-04-26 01:15:44 I gotta quit drowning myself in coconut oil and then try to open the bathroom door 
9909 2018-04-26 01:15:25 Renewables sales skyrocket with 100$ oil.
9910 2018-04-26 01:15:21 he may well be, but only an idiot would think the Charter offers any protection whatsoever for a pipeline or an American oil company.
9911 2018-04-26 01:15:18 What about investigate gas price collusion among oil companies! There is no solid reason for gas to raise up 50 cents a gal in two months
9912 2018-04-26 01:15:11 last jojo post for the night but joseph joestar carries enough oil on his person to slick up a huge sledgehammer and that's just canon sweeties
9913 2018-04-26 01:15:06 And fish oil, lots of fish oil
9914 2018-04-26 01:15:06 Check your Engine oil this morning.
9915 2018-04-26 01:15:03 No market in Asia for oil?? Did the whole place just sink into the ocean?
9916 2018-04-26 01:14:44 My brother usually uses light oil and dry-shaves with the razor instead of soap too, using shaving cream only occasionally. He says it’s a less-irritating shave, prefers how it feels.
9917 2018-04-26 01:14:35 oil-freeก้ทำกูหน้ามันอยู่ดีปะ5555 ส่วนpoใช้ครั้งเดียวยังไม่ได้ใช้อีกเลยสิวขึ้นก่อน55555

Or 
Put a tablespoon of Vick’s Vapor rub in a cup of water and boil it on the stove and the smell knocks it out!
9919 2018-04-26 01:13:58 Y’all know vaseline is a protectant? It doesn’t make the ash go away; it just protects it. Use unrefined coconut oil for your lips & skin!
9920 2018-04-26 01:13:55 Yep and let’s keep buying foreign oil...isn’t that a great Idea when we have our own to prosper!!
9921 2018-04-26 01:13:27 I think the Koch’s deserve their own special tax rate in 2020. 90%. The time not way to lessen it is to divest from oil and gas.
9922 2018-04-26 01:13:27 Yeah hold up. Lemme just dunk my head in a vat of olive oil
9923 2018-04-26 01:13:16 Don't forget to add in that we'll spend another 200K to wonder WHY the Oil sector is struggling in Canada.  You can't even make this stuff up.  It's something no sensible person could defend without showing a complete disregard for logic.
9924 2018-04-26 01:12:51 @westernandrose so this bourbon vanilla dry oil I ordered is  but this dirty chai butter you threw in . Omg I smell amazing!

9931 2018-04-26 01:11:32 I agree we don't need further government funding, but we need to stop chasing away foreign funding.  If ppl want to buy our Oil we should be helping business sell it.  While we build up the economy that can employ former oil workers
9932 2018-04-26 01:11:24 Jojoba oil? Good to know. When I was a teenager I tried to laser-shave it but it was too painful and I stopped.
9933 2018-04-26 01:11:17 I learned how to change oil then a few years later I learned how to shave.... lmao just have fun with ya @Russell___Smith no worries you can’t hide money!

9940 2018-04-26 01:09:54 Has the Government secretly pegged the price of oil for the past weeks?

9941 2018-04-26 01:09:27 I never make pasta. But if I do eat pasta, usually oil and Parmesan
9942 2018-04-26 01:09:23 As more economies transition off of oil, we would only be wasting money.  Continue as we are but no further funding.  If oil goes up, the companies will follow.  As prices drop, diversifying makes sense.

9966 2018-04-26 01:06:22 Promotion of middle eastern oil production by your government is perhaps the biggest destruction of gender equality in human history. Please stop.
9967 2018-04-26 01:05:58 Sweet tea? Cuz you know carbs are the root of those heart attacks right . Idg why they pan fried them tho. That gets too much grease into the inside. Deep fry in a hot oil is the way to go. Seals the crust way faster so they’re actually not as bad for you.
9968 2018-04-26 01:05:57 Wait, you live in WA right on the Sound? I thought everyone in WA was more environmental than I am!  Are you in favor of oil/gas/coal? I'm no expert on renewable energy. Google stuff on your own if you want to.
9969 2018-04-26 01:05:45 Did you miss the part about how the Sanders campaign doesn't object to the authenticity of the logs? Face it. You fell for a snake oil salesman who doesn't live up to his own hype.
9970 2018-04-26 01:05:42 Alberta's economy has already shut down because of oil, thousands of jobs have already been lost and created massive deficits. maybe if they had better economic policies regarding their oil wealth, they wouldn't be in such mess. #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli #ProtectTheInlet #StopKM

9972 2018-04-26 01:05:05 I think you could make the same argument for about everything... oil, energy in general, technology, capital, clothes, glasses, computers, books.. what don’t we consume too much of here?
9973 2018-04-26 01:05:03 Lesson learned: just because you CAN substitute coconut oil for butter in a cookie dough recipe doesn’t mean that you SHOULD #yuck
9974 2018-04-26 01:04:55 he was totally wrong especially when he said "the youths claim Nigeria has been an oil producing country" are we not ?
9975 2018-04-26 01:04:44 MSM can't tell the truth or they lose broadcast license. Whistleblowers can't disclose what they know or lose their freedom. Sovereign countries can't sell oil in own currency or they get bombed. Authorities can't allow gold to rise or it exposes USD weakness. See a pattern?
9976 2018-04-26 01:04:41 Olive oil can save it...
9977 2018-04-26 01:04:26 So far--and with the caveat that my face is a mess because dry skin + 7 mos into puberty 2.0--what's working for me is very hot water -> jojoba oil instead of any kind of shaving cream or soap -> very hot water -> toner
9978 2018-04-26 01:04:20 15 y/o: Can I make some popcorn on the stovetop?

15 y/o: First I’m gonna let the dog out the front door, chase her around the neighborhood and leave hot oil and popcorn on the burner.

9988 2018-04-26 01:02:23 Sext: I’ll change your oil for you, don’t worry
9989 2018-04-26 01:02:21 Current me: Hey genius, you should change out your frying oil because it had paprika in it once long ago. It’ll really suck when you fry stuff.
Past me: What? I can’t hear you!

9993 2018-04-26 01:01:28 But not if politicians like Trump, Zinke, Pruitt...keep taking money from coal/oil/gas and allow this. Coal, oil, and gas are dirty! I like clean air and water! I like clean oceans, beaches, and marine life! Don't you?!?!? I'm sure you can research this on your own though.

9997 2018-04-26 01:01:06 That’s exactly what it looks like when I do an oil change.
9998 2018-04-26 01:01:04 Edibles will become more and more popular much like the big spike in oil users in the medicinal cannabis market.
9999 2018-04-26 01:01:03 1) super hot water

3) more hot water
4) toner

10003 2018-04-26 01:00:51 Nothing. But everything is cyclical.  The housing market, oil prices, recessions, changes in climate.  Nothing that we do, at this point, will have any significant change on the environment.  Maybe 100s of years from now, but then another ice age will come and we'll all be dead.
