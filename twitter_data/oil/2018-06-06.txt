52 2018-06-06 23:53:54 This sounds familiar. Oil companies have repeatedly used Middle East conflict and hurricanes as a reason to raise prices...and then they’ll show record profits in the same quarter.

72 2018-06-06 23:50:08 Yes!  But his inability to delegate and not micromanage (and a fairly bad economy with oil hikes and shortages as the centerpiece) cost him reaching the goals he wanted to achieve.
73 2018-06-06 23:49:42 Except that both India and China are leaving Canada in the dust when it comes to renewables. China is installing a soccer field of solar every hour of every day. Replacing fleets of diesel with electric buses so fast it's affecting global demand for oil.

93 2018-06-06 23:46:10 I would never buy a lip scrub. Just use a dab of coconut oil and sugar. 

The pigmentation on WnW is solid. Some of their formulas beat high end. Check Temptalia reviews.

95 2018-06-06 23:45:29 I still think about this one by who struck up a conversation with me in a Jiffy Lube about a year ago. He was sweet, wore glasses & a baseball cap, and said he usually changed his own oil but didn’t have time that day. I left without the digits, and I’ve never hated myself more.
96 2018-06-06 23:45:17 ... Oil changed. That'd be interesting. Bathing the Small Human is a piece of cake. "Do you want a bath?" "No... Can I have a shower-bath instead?" BUT! I did get the dog's nails trimmed, so partial credit?

116 2018-06-06 23:41:16 Yet they're attacking the government for not taking time and getting reports on the oil drilling decision though to be fair they *did* have a panel on meth testing. 21 members from MoH, ESR etc... and received 1,300+ community comments. Results released 2017. Just bad output.

124 2018-06-06 23:40:04 To us here at Mad Science of Greater Salt Lake, we know that academic disciplines integrate.  Elijah McCoy invented an oil drip cup in 1872 that would lubricate engines.  His was the best!
125 2018-06-06 23:40:04 I can only imagine the outrage by the Yes side had they won in 2014 and there was subsequently a concerted attempt to cancel independence or to seek a second Referendum.
And there would likely have been given the sharp fall in the price of oil since then.

128 2018-06-06 23:39:35 Want your hair to be naturally shiny? Fish oil brings the glow from within, giving you strong strands that are naturally glossy and healthy.
129 2018-06-06 23:39:30 Big oil wouldn't let you. Theyve got fingers in pretty much everything these days. There's no supply shortage when the prices go up they just feel like charging more.
130 2018-06-06 23:39:28 Pouring oil on the fire is not the way to quench it. ：
131 2018-06-06 23:39:27 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
132 2018-06-06 23:39:23 I read that you could put a tiny drop of tea trea oil in a cotton pad and cover it though and it might work . I should try that
133 2018-06-06 23:39:20 A trick I learned to see if oil is hot enough to sautée is flick a bit of water in the pan. If it fizzes, probably ready.

Reader, I discovered you get much more than a fizz if you flick LaCroix into the pan.
134 2018-06-06 23:39:14 add a bit of crayon to color the wax. then, let it cool down a bit before adding essential oils to add scent (about ten drops of essential oil should do). then, pour the wax into the jars (slowly!). Leave a little bit towards the top unfilled. wait till the wax sets, then
135 2018-06-06 23:39:02 i could probably eat bread and oil all day long
136 2018-06-06 23:39:00 for example, science worked hand in hand with big oil companies for 134 years then turned around and placed the full blame on the public for causing climate change.

145 2018-06-06 23:37:58 People already willingly pay $2 in a store for a small bottle of water. Per volume that’s already more than a gallon of gas or barrel of oil. What today some willingly pay, tomorrow some may have to pay.

147 2018-06-06 23:37:52 It also depends on how much oil your car takes too.
148 2018-06-06 23:37:51 My mom had surgery done over a month ago and had to take her toe ring off. About 3 weeks ago we tried to put it back on, using every oil, lotion, and butter you could think of. Finally decided to youtube it... windex. Fucking windex and it slid right on. What the hell???

150 2018-06-06 23:37:18 if you mix your own cbd oils with cbd isolate + coconut mct oil you could cut the cbd oil cost down to $50 a month probably

152 2018-06-06 23:37:17 And Mike doesn’t fly, ever. Nor does he use a phone or computer to tweet from, brought to him by a ship from overseas that uses oil...

Hypocrite!!!
153 2018-06-06 23:37:14 That’s what the anti CANADIAN oil types needs to understand. Oil will flow. Pick where from wisely. If we have control, we can innovate.

158 2018-06-06 23:36:29 ... from the possibly naive perspective that if MBIE is worried about oil prices, it should be expressing the seriousness in terms of actual impact relative to other risks. 

Similar in idea to the difference of health risk to individual (country) vs average population risk.
159 2018-06-06 23:36:20 Am I meant to settle down in a small town workin oil for the rest of my life? I don’t think so.

They were amazing btw

188 2018-06-06 23:30:46 Stir together 3 pints dumplings with 1 pound beer. Sprinkle with Olive Oil. Fry. Serve with a nice chianti.

191 2018-06-06 23:30:20 I stir in about 6oz. of grapeseed and olive oil into all of my products to make my hair super shiny and to prevent the hair from getting weighted down since it makes the creams thinner

195 2018-06-06 23:30:04 Do you know if you synthetic or conventional oil?
196 2018-06-06 23:29:49 Things were even better under a President elected by the Iranian people. President Mosaddegh wanted to raise oil prices to a reasonable level for his country. BP had Britain and the CIA orchestrate a coup. Many history books present the facts.
197 2018-06-06 23:29:43 Lastly the way healthcare is administered needs to change. It should be more like care insurance. Insurance doesn't cover an oil change. It shouldn't cover a check up. Taking smaller items like that out of the insurance bureaucracy will drastically lower the cost
198 2018-06-06 23:29:36 I was there this morning - he was great. That's what Big Oil sounds like in Canada. Kiss the stereotypes goodbye!

203 2018-06-06 23:28:25 @jarrot69 your highlight is with the girl in your banner I’m pretty sure. It’s oil based so it’s pressed rn but it’s shake to loosen. Use a brush or finger to apply. There’s something extra for body/face/hands for taking so long 
Highlight is retrograde. Ur the 1st
204 2018-06-06 23:28:13 I keep getting ads about Pipelines, oil and gas in Canada.

“It’ll make X, in revenue!”

“It’ll create a surprisingly small amount of permanent jobs!”

Sustainable energy is the solution and fuck all these companies that want to drag this country backwards.
205 2018-06-06 23:28:10 Has there been any change in gas and oil policy from any of the other small producers? If not I'm not sure how this is relevant

212 2018-06-06 23:26:36 Somebody teach me how to change my oil. I’m not paying $70 anymore.
213 2018-06-06 23:26:35 I've only got coconut oil mixed with sugar to a paste and applied with a baby's toothbrush makes for a great lip-scrub. And apply lemon juice for ink stains on clothing.
214 2018-06-06 23:26:34 The squeaky wheel gets the oil.
The bigots in this country are getting the oil after being rusted out for several years and they are ready to head us back 150-yrs. They must only be allowed to have muskets. For Real!
215 2018-06-06 23:26:32 On this oil ready for the game

217 2018-06-06 23:26:29 That’s exactly how I feel! The whole ‘just give me the recipe’ attitude from people specifically towards blogs/websites seems to be influencing US cookbook publishing more (maybe?). Anyway, your book is a treasure to me. I’m making your olive oil no churn ice cream tomorrow.

224 2018-06-06 23:25:16 Sidetrack here-not sure if you saw my other Q-do you hold oil positions through reports like today? Also today seemed really constructive for longs-or don't get excited until over $66.00 ?
225 2018-06-06 23:25:15 Can you use something other than olive oil and salt?
226 2018-06-06 23:25:00 Castor oil,vitamin E and aloe Vera are meant to be good! I found brushing them and not using mascara helped too.
227 2018-06-06 23:24:48 Do you change oil too?

240 2018-06-06 23:22:02 Forbes' coverage is downright criminal, but the study itself is pretty  interesting as they were looking for evidence of 'defensive   institutional work' in the oil industry, i.e. the exact bias they found.  Crazy to not include that context!

246 2018-06-06 23:21:24 Wow. I've never heard that before. I mainly just buy the frozen purée. Doesn't surprise me tho, companies sell fake olive oil, this regular.
247 2018-06-06 23:21:21 Wouldn't it be interesting if big US oil companies/families were secretly contributing to Sierra Club and Tides to suppress the Canadian competition?

257 2018-06-06 23:18:53 Just another false flag by the oil companies to keep prices high.
There's been heretics saying oil would vanish by the 90's and production is higher then ever. The stupidity and the naivety of the left always stunts growth. More amazing is the imbecils that keep voting for them.

265 2018-06-06 23:17:30 Oh those are nice. Jack actually just found the other oil slick plug he lost to match my oil slick nose ring haha. I think the last new shoes I saw of yours were your metallic boots.

268 2018-06-06 23:17:14 If it was 1953 you'd have a point. After Vietnam our wars have been about oil. Let's not act like Syria is an actual threat to our freedom...
269 2018-06-06 23:16:30 Just keep that oil changed on it, the oil doesnt last long and they tend to consume a little, theres not muck to begin  with either

278 2018-06-06 23:14:35 Kenney a bigger embarrassment is how you take your marching orders from petro-corporations. If investors are pulling out, it's got more to do with the poor performance of oil than with Trudeau. How about putting Canada first for a change?

296 2018-06-06 23:12:26 It’s got like organic butter or palm oil in it. Greasy coffee!
297 2018-06-06 23:12:26 Something I find really helpful to stave off illness @jeffcannata and @acarboni is taking cod/salmon/other fish liver oil, and I take evening primrose oil to cure dry skin and itchy scalp, plus vitamin D because we don’t get a lot of sun in my part of Canada. #Balalaike
298 2018-06-06 23:12:16 @realDonaldTrump
Trump: “We’re now exporting energy for the first time. Never did it. Now we’re exporting energy.”
Except that this is a total LIE.
We've been a net EXPORTER of coal and a net IMPORTER of oil since the 1950's.
Liar!
Lying to your willfully ignorant Fox News base.
299 2018-06-06 23:12:14 Bt to start the business you just need flesh groundnut, vegetable oil, nylon for packaging then money for manpower, in all it will cost me #50,000 sir
300 2018-06-06 23:12:08 The alternative is no review and implementing policy on political grounds which they also take issue with (oil exploration) it's starting to look like a bit of a moan to me

302 2018-06-06 23:12:04 Once the US finds oil in other countries we rush to that location with or military but when a natural disaster happens we can’t help all of a sudden, but alright fasho I guess

305 2018-06-06 23:11:50 Not that she will care! Pretty damn arrogant & tone deaf. Not surprising being she’s a privileged oil billionaire. I’ve heard others make that same point btw, about how they describe themselves. Horrible. Everything about them and what they do is horrible. They’ve harmed SO MANY
306 2018-06-06 23:11:38 I really need some blessings oil
307 2018-06-06 23:11:31 Orpheus threw a p0420 code. My car is a fucking stoner. Is that the "Driver, please take me to Oregon" code? Am I supposed to shotgun smoke into his intake? Add hash oil to the engine?

311 2018-06-06 23:10:40 ? 치마가 흘러 내려..?
312 2018-06-06 23:10:39 Trump has always been against OPEC and has removed sanctions your lot implemented so we are now exporting oil. Also we can easily look up big pharma recipients so careful about throwing stones. Get to work h vote on bills so Trump can get to work. We see your lies. Tick tock
313 2018-06-06 23:10:39 Grounwater should be regulated like oil and gas.  The system works and it protects ALL private property rights.  Otherwise, groundwater regulation by litigation will continue to grow.

321 2018-06-06 23:09:54 Sad that these people do not realize that without fossil fuels, this country would almost be inhabitable.  Every single thing they possess is in one way or another a product of fossil fuels.  More than half of a barrell of oil is used to make consumer products - not gas.
322 2018-06-06 23:08:57 I love the Pure Hemp CBD Oil Products that my company offers!! I take i5 for my Psoriasis and other medical conditions and it has helped me so much start getting off some of my meds. It's sad that so many aren't able to get CBD.
323 2018-06-06 23:08:56 If it isn’t Fresh Beards it’s not worth using imo. They have the best quality of oil and instead of balm they have beard butter, which is much nicer.
324 2018-06-06 23:08:44 If you have cancer look into medical marijuana,, RSO, as in Rick Simpson Oil and FICO. The last two are concentrated marijuana oil which has cured people with stage 4 cancer and a month to live. Medical marijuana should be legal in all states.
325 2018-06-06 23:08:40 We should have never gone back to Iraq. Everything we've done in the middle east is not about right or wrong, it's about oil and feeding military contractors. And while some soldiers and contractors behaved horribly and should be taken out and shot, others helped build roads and
326 2018-06-06 23:08:40 @MaurielleFOX2 hey Maurielle, I just wanted to say that I agreed with you on the spider situation. You should try peppermint or eucalyptus essential oil. Put it in  a spray bottle with water and spread around your windows and around your door
327 2018-06-06 23:08:29 I’ll try the vitamin E oil cuz I tried the Vaseline and moisturizers  thx much love
328 2018-06-06 23:08:18 Great news for the US oil industry. Jobs, jobs, jobs.
329 2018-06-06 23:07:31 (for my first answer on 'oil companies' i didn't googled, i learned about the 1920's regulation)
Is it that all about? Reading, podcasts, encyclopedia... Not Instagram, memes...
330 2018-06-06 23:07:28 Do not tell these idiots u own a oil company they go stupid so lesson learned because a joke might turn out to be one of those that don't go away

332 2018-06-06 23:07:13 People have done it in the past. You can google it. But there are probably better ways to do it, such as glove oil.
333 2018-06-06 23:06:55 That good ole scoop of coconut oil
334 2018-06-06 23:06:36 I got an oil change, tire rotation, car wash and I’m about to go to the gym. I’m productive af. If I could be like this everyday that would be awesome.
335 2018-06-06 23:06:29 sad ppl love to do shit to make themselves make sure the feeling last forever.

- stay inside dark room
- stay by themselves
- stay in bed
- sad music 
- etc etc

imagine your hair being on fire and you grabbing oil and lighting a match on the rest of your body. 

Ridiculous.
336 2018-06-06 23:06:27 I wanted to fry plantain but we ran out of oil, I used my mums anointing oil....my plantain burnt
337 2018-06-06 23:06:24 Now, that true. It won’t really get to the SCOTUS. If the Governor becomes a Senator it will rapidly assume a protective posture on the Senate and what they pass. We have to protect and enjoy our glades and seas. We have enough oil and gas!

347 2018-06-06 23:04:45 Since the arabs discovered oil, a lot of them lost their brains. Especially their leaders. Not the leaders of muslims by any stretch of imagination. Infact a big burden on the intellectual capacity of muslims worldwide a vast majority of who are non-arabs.
348 2018-06-06 23:04:38 6lbs chicken breast, 1 lb red lentils, 3 cans of no salt added green beans, 1 container of blueberries, 1 lb spinach, 3 sweet potatoes, 5 large carrots, 1/2 cup EVOO, and 1/2 cup EV coconut oil. Cook how you want to but we put it in a crockpot for 6-7 hours on low.

357 2018-06-06 23:03:20 It’s crazy to think that it is still cheaper to pull crude oil from ground, refine it,  polymerize to plastic, process further, than to recycle.
358 2018-06-06 23:03:09 Now that a barrel of our oil is over $70 we are not hearing anything from them ooo.
359 2018-06-06 23:03:08 @MadameIngrid I poked around a McDougall forum. I learned that the McDougall diet has loosened up quite a bit. Its now what many people call a "no added fat" (no oil) diet.  You can eat things like soy, avocados, etc unless you are trying to lose weight or treat a medical issue.
360 2018-06-06 23:03:02 Huge   they gonna keep those missiles away from you. You got too much OIL , sondont worry u'll just all b in labour camps 
361 2018-06-06 23:02:53 Thankfully i barely have stretch marks and i have big ass thighs. Straight baby oil works forsure 
362 2018-06-06 23:02:47 Q3: Corporation commission managing oil a good call? Cornett: I think it’s appropriate. Jones: I support because commission is the qualified agency to deal with it. Stitt: Businesses need to know clear rules, that’s important. Lamb: that law should not be tinkered with.
363 2018-06-06 23:02:33 All the jackasses that oppose oil should walk everywhere  cuz driving there fucking BMW s home is just another whining  hypocrite
364 2018-06-06 23:02:18 somebody should’ve hipped me to tea tree oil a long time ago.. I use it for everything now.
365 2018-06-06 23:02:16 And also snake oil was a thing, and bleeding,  hot iron for hemorrhoids, trepanning ( you know to let out the demon), urinating on a wound and daily leachings for those fortunate enough to afford them. You are a quack of the highest order. Did the order give you your title?
366 2018-06-06 23:02:16 Now that a barrel of our oil is over $70 we are not hearing anything from them ooo.
367 2018-06-06 23:02:07 Yeah, glove oil is pretty cheap. Oil it up, put a ball in the pocket, tie it closed with string for a few days, keeps it soft protected.
368 2018-06-06 23:01:37 So we correct the abuse by turning off the oil tap? Everyone walk or bike to work? Shut off the furnace? Scientists are not economists. Money don’t fall out of the sky.
369 2018-06-06 23:01:36 Mike orders and air fryer because he's afraid of making chicken wings since the oil splatters hurt....-_- but it's okay for me to make them for him rightt....

374 2018-06-06 23:01:13 mom got peppermint oil in her eye. she desperately needed eyedrops. I got in my car and rushed to the store without my phone. dropped my keys while locking my car. locked out. but got the eyedrops. ran 2 miles home through woods in chacos and no bra. turns out she was just fine.
375 2018-06-06 23:01:12 All this for an oil change lol
376 2018-06-06 23:00:54 Remittances from USA is Mexico's Top income source, over and above their crude oil production.

Let that sink in.
377 2018-06-06 23:00:17 @anasalhajji #Crude_Quality_Matters 

Let me ask a question. A reason given for China buying shale oil is for environmental reasons. So tell me why China only basically buys light sweet crude oil from one country (the US) and virtually nothing from other light oil producers?

The only use for Iranian centrifuges is to make weapons.    They don't need energy.

382 2018-06-06 22:59:37 My journey has been low cost options such as I am trading in 2.5K challenge, then grow account to trade SPX RUT PCLN (Now BKNG) etc. And then For futures only indices, then comes crude oil and bonds, and then comes metals. :)

395 2018-06-06 22:58:49 I'm aware of Big Oil. Was that the demonstrable error? Consensus among climate scientists .. sure. they more or less exist to further this forecast. Since the 1920s the minds of the masses have been controlled after scientific principles and science tends to produce grandiose

Jones: It goes back to what’s fair. Taxes and incentives weren’t. Stitt: State should not be picking winners and losers.
405 2018-06-06 22:57:46 I think it’s because a lot of the brands guys use an oil is incorporated to the ingredients. But I think with Women’s perfumes, one of the first ingredients is alcohol which doesn’t last as long as an oil.

428 2018-06-06 22:55:13 It should be taxed the same rate as the oil producers for Gross Production Tax.
429 2018-06-06 22:55:00 Hate Nestle...don't forget their baby milk scandal in Africa, their water scandal and refusing to correctly label cereals to show just how much sugar is in them. Also, their palm oil is destroying orangutan habitats. I avoid their products at all costs.

435 2018-06-06 22:54:15 こういう向こう側からの攻撃への危機管理という面もあろうが、そんなこと許してたら、それこそ文化的なテロを許容するのとになる
436 2018-06-06 22:54:10 does cbd oil show up on drug tests?

don't bother answering, it's already my new excuse
437 2018-06-06 22:53:55 Not an "all terrain" 
Many were stuck in the sand when Haftir was ambushed near Ajdabya oil fields 

Can't beat the buggy in dunes surfing
438 2018-06-06 22:53:55 Jesus Christ is the only essential oil I need.

441 2018-06-06 22:53:30 have you looked into the Myelin Project and Lorenzo's oil?
442 2018-06-06 22:53:26 Loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ!
443 2018-06-06 22:53:21 The biggest issue the have with Iran is the fact the they have a load of oil they want to sell and the us and the Saudis don't want that.....so they demonise them and they get the rest of the world to fear their regime even though both have the death penalty?? No morals
444 2018-06-06 22:53:17 Blocking the pipeline does not stop people from burning oil. Getting AB to agree to carbon pricing was more important.
445 2018-06-06 22:53:17 wanting to buy oil diffuser so bad but is it a need? #dontwanttousemyallowance #thinkingreallyhard #butineedsomestressreliever #needorwant
446 2018-06-06 22:52:52 Absolutely i ain’t even tryna be shady or rude..but i expect to see a clean fucking nail bed or an accurate description of a video..had it said “Freaky Oil Worker digs for holes”” or “Well Endowed MMA Fighter punch fucks bottom” i would’ve been prepared. That’s all I’m saying
447 2018-06-06 22:52:49 You basically are. When you oil up and lay out there, it's slow basting your skin
448 2018-06-06 22:52:48 Mr Annor took rice, cooking oil and oguan?  Wow
449 2018-06-06 22:52:48 うらやましいんだけどそれ
450 2018-06-06 22:52:42 Since an enormous oil deposit was discovered in his collar.
451 2018-06-06 22:52:19 Mine tends to look more like crayon work when I’ve used oil pastels. Do you mind if I ask, did you use a shading tool?
452 2018-06-06 22:52:09 My co workers have been calling me a leather couch ever since I told them I’ll be tanning w oil in DR
453 2018-06-06 22:52:04 My dad taught me pretty well but if it’s anything other than oil, brakes, or battery...i can’t help. I’m only good for the basics.

456 2018-06-06 22:51:31 Q1: What’s the greatest threat to the oil and gas industry in the state? Stitt: The budget (and says he’s a great CEO). Lamb: OPEC, basic opponents, insiders, Governor who is not proven supporter. Cornett: Uncertainty at the state legislature. Jones: You need stability.

459 2018-06-06 22:51:02 That is the new Nigeria I am dreaming of. Let have states that determines what height they want to go. Let the drive comes from those small corners,  let have the state institutions fully functional. If truly the north has 7 oil wells I think that is a lovely luck
460 2018-06-06 22:50:59 Wrong. Noting to do with oil price. Companies make money even oil is 40. CARBON TAX is the reason.
461 2018-06-06 22:50:58 You use it before or after oil if you don't mind me asking.
462 2018-06-06 22:50:56 I think this article has it opposite! Washing should damage all bacteria on ur skin, even the good ones, and strips natural oils. Showering too much can actually lead to excess oil production
Research says it's fine, if not better to skip a day. Given u didn't sweat all day lol
463 2018-06-06 22:50:42 So essential oils are basically the snake oil of today, right?
464 2018-06-06 22:50:41 What you guys are doing with medical marijuana - others are doing with oil to enable 24/7 trading and bypass middlemen for better prices

473 2018-06-06 22:49:32 Bruh who got oil 
474 2018-06-06 22:49:25 One time Kallie told me this story about her ex changing her oil. He asked what she would do without him and she said idk, probably cry. And he replied.. you already do that all the time anyway and I laughed really hard bc he wasn’t wrong.
475 2018-06-06 22:49:17 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。
476 2018-06-06 22:49:15 But good to know they support us dying in foreign deserts for oil
477 2018-06-06 22:49:11 
478 2018-06-06 22:49:08 Which is why they’d rather die than restructure. They will keep looking for excuses/stalling until their railroad to Niger republic is completed and oil exploration in the basin yields fruit. #ourmumudondo
479 2018-06-06 22:49:06 Los altísimos precios de la gasolina y gas oil en RD se deben a: adición ilegal por galón de unos RD$10 en el llamado precio de paridad de importación y administración de la ley,RD$20 por márgen excesivo de comercializacion y $30 en indexación inflada de impuestos. !RD$60 de más!

493 2018-06-06 22:45:49 Cannabis is like crude oil.  Thousands of refined products and the cracking processes for each product are still being perfected and patented.

-pretty sure they're using the same oil 
495 2018-06-06 22:45:46 Stir together 1 pound broccoli with 1 cup goose. Sprinkle with Olive Oil. Mix until crumbly. Serve
496 2018-06-06 22:45:36 Lmaooooooooo ! I got that KD hair without this oil treatment lol.
497 2018-06-06 22:45:33 Yup. If data is indeed "the new oil" (or whatever other metaphor), it's like tying it all up in a network of provincial non self-service petrol stations where each staff member is being asked to cover an entire county at any one time.

Is that analogy working too hard? Perhaps.
498 2018-06-06 22:45:29 Hey @realDonaldTrump: this is a great time to finish what we started in 1812 and annex Canada! Think of all the oil fields...

501 2018-06-06 22:45:13 If you don’t believe her you haven’t done any research on what’s going on in the world. 
There’s child abduction, pizzagate, rape, racism, just to name a few. Syria may have been bombed for its oil lines that run through its country, look into it. 
We need a government reform.

But as we try to move on, get off oil, etc. it'll be hard. Hopefully involving/centering more ppl will help ease that

525 2018-06-06 22:42:46 When their cash cow shrivels & the patents are released. It's game over for big oil. Game over for big pharma and game over for big Agro.  The old world crumbles while the new world is built with heart & hustle.  We wouldn't have incarnated on  if we weren't strong enough.

Just do not eat junk food (sugar, oil, refained grains).
And limit animal based foods.

544 2018-06-06 22:38:32 Interesting. I stopped using canola oil several years ago when I found out that it may cause cancer.

547 2018-06-06 22:38:04 UK “subsidises” imports of oil & gas by not charging any production taxes on them, we only tax the production of our own oil & gas! You can’t call that a subsidy because I think WTO rules prevent us taxing US or Qatar LNG. We could remove all our own production taxes though
548 2018-06-06 22:38:02 Just found out peppermint and lavender oil mixed together can cure a migraine.  #naturalhealing

553 2018-06-06 22:37:29 animal fat or butter and/or petroleum oil is placed in or on the pots or pans then animal parts and/or vegetables are caramelized resulting in cuisines that we/you/i consume for nutrients digestions
554 2018-06-06 22:37:25 But if oil is really falling, can that price pressure be maintained?
555 2018-06-06 22:37:20 And America can only do so much to support before Iran restrict’s America’s access to oil. Money talks, and there are people who have more say in this than our incoherent president

562 2018-06-06 22:35:48 a lot of these things can just be dropped into a saucepan w some sesame oil and soy/teriyaki sauce! cover it and cook on a low flame for like a half hour and it’ll be done

565 2018-06-06 22:35:11 noooooooooooooo don't use that facial scrub! You're basically using sand paper on your poor skin. Try a basic oil free cleanser and use a microdermabrasion scrub for an exfoliant once a week instead
566 2018-06-06 22:34:51 Mayonnaise is an emulsion of oil and eggs, both ingredients in pretty much every cake.  It sounds disgusting but there is logic behind it.  I've never followed a cake recipe that includes it, though.
567 2018-06-06 22:34:30 here people! which one of products that you will recommended me to use it. 
for sunblock? 
for argan oil ?

568 2018-06-06 22:34:20 No more oil from Iran, tariffs on metals(can goods and cars and etc. Thats just a start. Common sense should tell you that.

571 2018-06-06 22:33:50 Crude oil prices are going up which means more revenue and states' capacity to pay, the Nigerian workers deserve a living wage... any opposition to a long overdue increase in workers wages will swing more votes for Buhari

573 2018-06-06 22:33:16 Oil & Gas Investor reports Permian, Bakken, etc. companies claim break even in the $30/bbl range. Funny math as most have a bottom line that is as deflated as their reserve estimates are inflated.
574 2018-06-06 22:33:04 And they will blame the price of oil not market access.
575 2018-06-06 22:33:01 I’ll rub myself down with coconut oil like I always do
576 2018-06-06 22:32:27 Shocked but not surprised because this GHANA..pls can u work on the oil sector too
577 2018-06-06 22:32:22 And don't get started about baby oil
578 2018-06-06 22:32:16 They can have the oil. Venezuelans want FREEDOM
579 2018-06-06 22:32:05 I am in hell. We are getting the oil changed and they have Fox News on in the waiting room.  *puts on headphones*
580 2018-06-06 22:31:54 Culinary kids we share the “kitchen” with spilled oil all over the floor and didn’t clean it up. Steven is walking around with paper towels under his slides. We’re not cleaning it up y’all.
581 2018-06-06 22:31:53 That oil $$$$ Don’t work N college football See history
582 2018-06-06 22:31:52 Licking taints of Trump n Pruitt, who are denying climate change for big oil. That's the antithesis of evil.
583 2018-06-06 22:31:37 I grew up in the 70’s with 3 older brothers and a father who instead of protecting me, taught me...how to mow the lawn, to change the oil, and throw a perfect spiral football. I’m the lucky recipient of men  ahead of their time in empowering women. #weneedmalementors #empowerus
584 2018-06-06 22:31:30 - use coconut oil to highlight cheekbones

585 2018-06-06 22:31:19 At death's door eating ribeye steak, butter, cream, coconut oil. I dont think my brain thinks I'm starving. Lost 10% body weight and BG A1c has returned to low normal 5.1%/ 31mmol/mol from high diabetic. 11% /94mmol/mol.
586 2018-06-06 22:30:45 The liver flush involves drinking a citrus/olive oil concoction over night with the help of epsom salts
587 2018-06-06 22:30:40 Let's get out of there and protect Israel.   Too many rogues all over the world have nukes, Iran is no different.   We do not need their oil, we need not shed blood for them anymore - perpetual and fruitless.  Turkey a NATO member? Really?  There's a better way.   CFA
588 2018-06-06 22:30:20 The only thing I want pure and virgin is olive oil.
589 2018-06-06 22:30:14 Funny serendipity there: I used Dr. Bronner's peppermint for the first time a few months ago when we were on big island. It turns out that's REALLY peppermint oil in there. A proper wash results in a...vigorous minty tingle in...unexpected places.
590 2018-06-06 22:30:02 He cares more about oil and legalizing marijuana than he does about getting reserves clean and safe drinking water.
591 2018-06-06 22:29:51 got a car with a fresh oil change
592 2018-06-06 22:29:16 the stove top or oven temperature nobs/regulators are available because oil is burned turning a power hydro container that in turn revolves a turbine that produces electricity that ignites the iron coils that heat the pots or pans that we/you cook in or on
593 2018-06-06 22:29:13 Activated Charcoal Facial Cleansing Bar, Tamanu oil (use as your daily facial moisturizer accompanied by SPF, at all times;Lemon brightening overnight serum  (use daily at night after cleansing) & Green Tea Exfoliating Scrub(use once/twice a week)

597 2018-06-06 22:28:42 Bill Clinton and #MeToo like oil and water......all over Monica's dress.
598 2018-06-06 22:27:51 good morning, ohshit i can feel the oil at my face
599 2018-06-06 22:27:48 I want to learn the perfume oil business. Anybody who knows anybody who knows anybody that teaches?
600 2018-06-06 22:27:33 Got my oil changed now about to get my breaks fixed !
601 2018-06-06 22:27:27 Was complaining about getting his oil changed
602 2018-06-06 22:27:26 Slow march towards 3000 this summer. Market rotation between sectors kept the market afloat when Financials and Oil took dips...market rotates till stability is made then grinds its way higher.
603 2018-06-06 22:27:16 They've never needed a squirrel to not report an Obama scandal before.
604 2018-06-06 22:27:11 I do try to be conscious of the environmental impact of my actions. I've recently started avoiding foods that contain palm oil (a LOT of them) because of the harm those plantations are doing to local animal and plant populations. Conservation is important.
605 2018-06-06 22:27:03 Thus the need for the Holy oil and the Extreme oil which has been denied to us by the evil cabal. Holy oil contains cannabis buds and heals. It was a miracle then and is a miracle now. Amen.
606 2018-06-06 22:27:01 Biggest predictor of crime ? Poverty.

Biggest creator of poverty? Conservative policies.

95 of 100 poorest counties are in red states. 17 of top 20 in gun violence are lax law red states.

Too much of both...tipping point is here.

608 2018-06-06 22:26:38 The dozens of message long thread arguing about the sustainable palm oil in the peanut butter. Plus the nonsense Don mentioned.  Some folks have no clue about how fortunate we are to work where we do.

Also interesting that the reservoirs found in the previous well didn't see oil
616 2018-06-06 22:25:00 try using castor oil or coconut oil, it'll help grow them back

618 2018-06-06 22:24:48 Roast them in the oven with a little avocado or olive oil and a tad of balsamic vinegar.  They have a sweet/bitter flavor kinda like a turnip.  Or you could just go with the boob thing.  No judgement.
619 2018-06-06 22:24:47 Blah..blah..blah...they did not presented anything new.  Only they added more oil into fire by bypassing results that may/will shape their future. $NKTR

630 2018-06-06 22:24:05 I use extra virgin olive oil before showering. And coconut oil soon as I get out.
631 2018-06-06 22:23:52 Hi good people, I would like any information on how I can get BAOBAB seeds and oil from any part of South Africa. 

Kindly help me out, as this is quite urgent. 

Thank you. RT
632 2018-06-06 22:23:33 @DOMtheB0MB can you make a video involving baby oil??
633 2018-06-06 22:23:20 Hydrates, and the oils included are very good for your skin. Ex: vitamin E, Argan oil, olive, etc.

642 2018-06-06 22:21:38 Oh dear, not great, 3 things I recommend, salt pipe and high content oregano oil capsules, at least 5g+ vitamin C powder per day. Take care and get well soon 
643 2018-06-06 22:21:31 That’s one small piece of a very large pie.  We import tons of other products outside what was recently focused on (Oil being a main one).  What do you think the imbalance actually is between the two nations?

645 2018-06-06 22:21:16 By all means, promote yet another form of magical thinking over actual science. “Anything I can put over for a quick buck” is the mountebank’s motto, right? Snake oil is *so* 18th Century. You’re a disgrace and a fraud.

647 2018-06-06 22:21:06 People always ask why Victorians didn’t smile for photos. Simple answer: they didn’t smile for oil portraits.  Deeper answer: future generations will ask why we were always grinning.
648 2018-06-06 22:21:04 Meanwhile in the 1st half of 20th century USA exported over 90% of international oil trade, way above what even Saudi Arabia has captured.

665 2018-06-06 22:18:08 castor oil was working wonders on my eyebrows idk why i stopped using it
666 2018-06-06 22:18:02 My essential oil roller blend that I use for those extra high anxiety and emotionally filled days smells amazinggg.  Why do I always forget that I have it?!
667 2018-06-06 22:18:00 *Mischief managed*  aka I finally changed my oil.
668 2018-06-06 22:17:59 Which point are you claiming accuracy on? It’s not the one I spoke to. This individual claimed AB oil paid for QC (and quite rudely). That’s not how transfer payments work. Oil doesn’t pay for federal transfers to anyone. And Ontario taxpayers pay the most for all transfers.
669 2018-06-06 22:17:56 @AriannaPfled it’s an old wives tale but it works, I use lemon and cloves and a lemongrass oil in my diffuser and a good old fashion fly swatter
670 2018-06-06 22:17:56 If you love me you will put coconut oil in my hair.
671 2018-06-06 22:17:38 Haha. Palm oil.

673 2018-06-06 22:17:11 same girl same. try something w rosehip oil
674 2018-06-06 22:17:08 Those places take the old oil, process/clean it, and sell it back to people.     Best to pay a bit more at the dealership

688 2018-06-06 22:15:09 Exactly.

Very insensitive on many levels.
694 2018-06-06 22:14:01 The Rohingyas are the ones that are being manipulated, most likely by Western powers that want to get a hold on Myanmat oil and gas. The Roros will be (already have been) cast aside when no longer required.

708 2018-06-06 22:12:36 Just now seeing this. #BigFacts however just because they don’t mix doesn’t mean it can’t work. #Cooking101 just have to know when to have more oil than water and vice versa.
709 2018-06-06 22:12:23 yes and oil gets turned into heat, light and water but don't try swimming in it
710 2018-06-06 22:12:15 Coconut oil!! Oh, hail to the no!!!
711 2018-06-06 22:12:14 Yes they hid the oil rigs, some were so far out at sea you couldn't even see them. And the oil - not just underground, but *under water*. Thieves and blaggards at 'WM' did it I bet.

720 2018-06-06 22:10:51 Firstly thanks for the reply, secondly if your argument was based on oil price globally and the on-going esclations in the middle East or Trump in the white house  I would have said you have somewhat of a point. But you didn't so I don't agree. Do you pay your staff more now ?
721 2018-06-06 22:10:40 And gross AF. I had watching people do this. It's literally oil and eggs blended. Nane use to make her own.

730 2018-06-06 22:09:32 Ah now it makes sense. Your unsavoury attitude to olive oil.
731 2018-06-06 22:09:26 Grill is almost ready. I basically do it direct/indirect on a higher elevated grill... the pot has a baste of butter, olive oil, garlic, soy sauce, white wine vinegar, red Chili, thyme, onion, s&P... you baste it while it cooks...
732 2018-06-06 22:09:19 maybe if Scotland becomes independent we'll give the oil to the EU ....sounds about right
733 2018-06-06 22:09:18 Cadbury shite chocolate since hostile takeover of traditional UK company by Kraft, low quality/profits first US global corp, once Canadian cheese company gobbled up. Milk replaced by vegetable oil etc. Big capitalists eat little capitalists (Marx) & we lose.

740 2018-06-06 22:08:20 It's happening there too. Our government put us on freaking alert, raised prices and taxes in everything and now that oil price is going up ... nothing. They're just stealing from us.
741 2018-06-06 22:08:10 use coconut oil !!
742 2018-06-06 22:08:09 Wal-Mart is terrible at automotive. Come in without an appointment, oil change takes a 40 min. Make an appointment, it takes an hour...

748 2018-06-06 22:06:21 just the fact that people were more pressed abt their misconceptions of a cartoon character to the point that they would argue with actual people of that culture but didnt say a damn thing about our land being sold to oil companies around the same time is super telling :)

759 2018-06-06 22:04:31 Investors will come back when oil goes over 80 and stays there, much cheaper places to operate than the oil sands.

762 2018-06-06 22:04:09 what does this mean are you talking about oil
763 2018-06-06 22:04:07 If you remove your make up gently with some q-tips and oil free make up remover it’s totally worth it! (I find it taught me to be gentile with my eyes cause im usually pretty rough with them lol) also it’s not damaging if you go to someone who knows what they’re doing!
764 2018-06-06 22:03:50 Exactly! Switching from oil based power plants to hydel is a solution of all on going electricity problems.
765 2018-06-06 22:03:34 I love chili oil! (*ﾉ▽ﾉ)

768 2018-06-06 22:03:17 It’s a hassle having a tiny ass car that hardly anyone can do an oil change on. Fuck Leesville.
769 2018-06-06 22:03:12 Rage against Trump isn’t “political.”  It isn’t Rep vs Dems. It’s a moral issue. Of which he has none. Good for the whole team. Don’t give a minute to that snake oil salesman #MangoMussolini
770 2018-06-06 22:03:11 Actually the handgun is more likely to shatter the petrie dish.

Hemp on the other hand has never killed anyone. It is actually good for you. We've evolved in it's presence for 4,000 years, and for 80 years of oil it's been banned. Also, stay away from vaccines, including flu.

772 2018-06-06 22:02:41 Which light are you talking about - there is an oil pressure light which can indicate a problem requiring immediate attention, or that vehicle also has an ‘oil service due’ or ‘change oil now’ indicator which is just an engine hours or odometer they reset after each oil change

Worst part was... the chicken was so spicy that it was BITTER
779 2018-06-06 22:01:26 Abi, rubbing Akara oil on our faces after them don chop am finish!
780 2018-06-06 22:01:26 @WhiteHouse America has excessive oil from fracking, so much so that they can export it for large profit. So why is it that Americans must pay $4 per gallon here at home? No excuse for this! Very treasonous to the people who protect the flag.
781 2018-06-06 22:01:01 the oil pant hasnt dried it has been hours

785 2018-06-06 22:00:11 Well based on your other questions/tweets on the subject. I'd go with a salad mix (even baby salad mix) that contains endive, drizzle an olive oil and vinegar type of dressing with a touch of feta on top. It won't make you hungry as fast. Get yourself some Omega 3 in the process.
786 2018-06-06 21:59:47 Well my neighbor backed into my car and my power steering is shot from being recalled and now I have an oil leak. So HOPEFULLY I get it back tomorrow

791 2018-06-06 21:58:51 berapa aja. dia face oil dan bahannya organik. jadi menurutku aman aman aja
792 2018-06-06 21:58:32 Choosing Saudi oil over Canadian oil, which is what you’re doing, is about as climate unfriendly as you could get. Why do you hate the planet?
793 2018-06-06 21:58:28 Doesn't Venezuela have one of the biggest oil reserves in the world?
794 2018-06-06 21:58:22 They offered it to me when I went to get an oil change. You pay this one time fee like $50 and the whole year you get discounted EVERYTHING.
795 2018-06-06 21:58:17 pakai spot treatment like aiken tea tree oil & benzac
796 2018-06-06 21:58:01 I have the cuticle oil that’s lavender scented so then all I can do is smell my hands for the next 5 min. What a tragedy
797 2018-06-06 21:57:51 It actually is. It’s choosing the most environmentally friend oil development in the world instead of a much much worse one
798 2018-06-06 21:57:51 You could try some CBD oil. I gave some to a friend of mine and it helped with his anxiety. Might want to try the THC free one though, cuz some people get weird dreams from the full spectrum stuff. Text me if you’re interested .(346-754-2766)
799 2018-06-06 21:57:29 I just wanna know why my oil change was $80 today 
800 2018-06-06 21:57:13 Who doesn't care enough to do anything to slow climate change? Mafia, gang members, terrorists, Trump supporters. Big Coal, Big Oil, Beef Industry. Who else?

803 2018-06-06 21:56:39 I buy method spray for the bathroom. I make floor wash: diluted vinegar for tile, diluted rubbing alcohol for laminate + essential oil for your intent. Borax is great but not enough on its own, I add it to store-bought hypoallergenic detergent.

805 2018-06-06 21:56:19 @AdamFrank4 any exo-civilization would need analogs for wood, grain and oil no? Without wood and grain humanity could not have become more than hunter-gatherers. Without fossil fuel, no industrial revolution. I look forward to reading your book.
806 2018-06-06 21:56:12 !? it’s so unnecessary. Frozen pasta is cheap and fresh pasta is just like flour egg and oil. Sickening.
807 2018-06-06 21:56:09 This is like... The most basic thing ever... Don't pour water on flaming oil.. or any flaming liquid, to be exact. Use a damn piece of cloth.. or something as simple as a bag of flour.. you're supposed to choke the flame.
808 2018-06-06 21:55:56 Half every US tax dollar and rising. Wonder why USA is trying and accomplishing coups in Iran and Venezuela for hands on cheap oil to fund global imperialism
809 2018-06-06 21:55:49 Party with a differnce ended up being a party filled with snake oil salesmen
810 2018-06-06 21:55:46 Many of the same fans that insist the Oilers have to keep Klefbom are also the same ones that insist that Lucic and Russell are garbage. There are a lot of malfunctioning hockey radars in Oil Country. IMO IMO IMO
811 2018-06-06 21:55:43 fair deal would be water for oil.
812 2018-06-06 21:55:43 Talk about turning speeds? How about that oil tanker Xhaka?
813 2018-06-06 21:55:35 My super smoothie today had vegan protein powder, peanut butter powder, granola with chia and molasses, brown & powerful frozen banana, avocado, cinnamon, coconut oil and a pinch of pink Himalayan sea salt.  Delish!
814 2018-06-06 21:55:34 I mean you clearly dont know how Chemo works, but i agree that plant based diets and CBD oil significantly reduce the risk of acquiring cancer
815 2018-06-06 21:55:27 but with u were literally there u even laughed so much when han told me to use oil or something to burn it faster

823 2018-06-06 21:53:44 If you ever have problems with your fresh nose piecing I suggest using tea tree oil!! That shit works wonders
824 2018-06-06 21:53:43 The price of an oil change is ridiculous!

828 2018-06-06 21:53:25 Just got a pub quiz question right because of @thewestwingTV. Series 2, episode 2. Thank you to Sam Seaborn @RobLowe for telling me about the Exxon Valdez oil spill! "Buy better boats" TV does teach you something!
829 2018-06-06 21:53:15 Oil would assuredly have to retain in any deal (unless taking bad a similar bad contract like Eriksson) - they’d also need to find a replacement middle 6 LW with the rest of the cap space they’d save.
830 2018-06-06 21:53:14 The USA is doing their best to wrap up Middle East for oil control, for the long game against China and Russia.
831 2018-06-06 21:53:07 I just put castor oil on my eyebrows I am the Pinterest queen
832 2018-06-06 21:52:52 Add healthy fat to help satiate.  Perhaps a salad with olive oil dressing, some avocado or some nuts?
833 2018-06-06 21:52:52 I'm not rejecting supply and demand, I am rejecting that in NZ sized oil supply countries, the magnitude of effects are great enough to make a blind bit of difference to world prices.
834 2018-06-06 21:52:31 I could change your oil for you. No bs. I do it all the time on my Z!
835 2018-06-06 21:52:26 I had this experience 20 yrs ago during my work time at grocery. Shit happens and we laughed about it. Ppl who saw it then laughed also. We spilled cooking oil and it was oily. But thats it. Netizen jaman skg suka kelebihan demi respon

841 2018-06-06 21:51:01 Fuck keystone. We’re building a new pipeline directly to the west coast to trade our oil with Asia.
842 2018-06-06 21:50:51 I’d be in shambles without my essential oil defuser
843 2018-06-06 21:50:31 I answered this already. Let's study drunk driving by talking about cars, or bombing by talking about fertilizer and fuel oil, or stabbings by talking about kitchen knives. Still blaming inatimate objects instead of looking at the real cause.
844 2018-06-06 21:50:17 LUK 7:46 My head with oil you did not anoint: but this woman has anointed my feet with ointment. (AKJV)
845 2018-06-06 21:50:14 Actually, even raw sewage is 95% water. The vast majority of the rest is organic material that the river/ocean will deal with promptly. It is not remotely like an oil/bitumen spill that takes very much longer for the natural systems to deal with. Truth.
846 2018-06-06 21:50:00 Literally 2 mins after you sent this we got a call that he has made his way to Edinburgh!!!! On the way now to get him, they think he got stuck in a car or something he’s covered in oil but he’s okay 
847 2018-06-06 21:49:55 Yep looks like another Leeds,  if they go into administration they get demoted down the leagues i think.  City went down to League One,    but look at them now,   oil welled to the hilt
848 2018-06-06 21:49:46 Absolutely fuming at myself opening my new reed diffuser and spilling the oil all over my room and on my hands it stinks 
849 2018-06-06 21:49:40 My mother who is Caribbean told me of the 'greasy man' scare during the 1942 blackout on Aruba when a German sub attacked the island that had the largest oil refinery in the world. I remember it since the new @forteantimes delves into the similar 'oily men' scares from Malaysia.

851 2018-06-06 21:49:33 Endive is just lettuce with attitude. I don't like it.  Try fish on bed of steamed spinach with cracked pepper and tomato cubes tossed in olive oil.  Green beans maybe. You can add a potato (white or sweet) for bulk and satiety. Get the volume up! :-)
852 2018-06-06 21:49:28 Excellent inaugural by Rob Ewers - turns out that Oil Palm, although not good, is probably the best way to grow oil in terms of yield per hectare
853 2018-06-06 21:49:26 Was literally gonna message you about the amount of bread I’ve eaten tonight. Scattered with olive oil. Mmm.

855 2018-06-06 21:49:24 I dig most of them on their own.  They just definitely appear like they came out of the same design house.

The name thing with Cavalry/Valour/Founders FC and no city/region name is a bit jarring.  Kind of a bit too cute.  If FCE became "Oil Sands FC", I think I'd riot.

862 2018-06-06 21:48:29 I got oil of oregano in my eyeball last week and I thought honestly that I might go blind. Scariest 20 minutes of screaming in pain of my life. Try milk. It neutralizes that burn.

870 2018-06-06 21:47:45 That scene at the end of THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA where Nate tells Andy he's a chef now and uses the oil from his greasy fucking hair to fry chicken or whatever is so touching. He's gross. All her friends are gross. I'm in a mood.
871 2018-06-06 21:47:34 Easy, Red Coat Accessory, we can pave over your icy shit with our lovely tanks, too.  We’ve already fought a war for oil during my lifetime. What’s one over Aluminum... or Snickers for that matter?

In a global world can’t have different tv rev rules. They not in epl but take our players. Rapidly heading to euro league? W/ one rule.
929 2018-06-06 21:39:59 Well speaking from me and you, wouldn't you take care of something that's yours? Like your car, I'm sure you clean it, get new tires, fresh oil and all the maintenance as needed?  Or would you rather use Enterprise for the rest of your life?
930 2018-06-06 21:39:51 Or, baby red potatoes roasted in olive oil, garlic, and rosemary. With bread, of course.

936 2018-06-06 21:39:31 Tonight I learnt that putting oil in a pan, turning it on and then answering the phone, forgetting said aforementioned pan is a terrible idea! You will return to a stench, your eyes will sting and your flat will be covered in smoke.

In other news...  smoke alarms work! Whoop
937 2018-06-06 21:39:29 Oh no. Is this earth shattering or what ! Say it an't so.. Anything else  of consequence happening. Hey, whats for dinner....and oh yeah, I almost forgot the oil change.

941 2018-06-06 21:38:45 I don't remember the exact measurements, Pinterest has the recipe. But it's essentially, filtered water, vegetable glycerin, and vitamin E oil.
942 2018-06-06 21:38:29 I used to be told "you must love a good oil spill!" 

"Not really, tbh. But I do dry work anyway."

"What?"

"Charterparties, bills of lading and stuff. If you do wet work, you'll do collisions and what not."

"Oh, right."

Stock market overcook while real Americans continue to struggle

It was concerns about main street Americans ability to pay their bills (Oil price spike=gas price spike) that triggered last recession

Financial shenanigans made it worse but trigger was family budget

972 2018-06-06 21:34:38 Fake news paid for by oil and energy companies, who want to take the last dollar out of our pockets before we go renewables. By the way, May was 5 degrees hotter than ever before. Conservatives are worried about immigration wait for climate change. Stupid!

977 2018-06-06 21:34:14 Why are we attempting any of this? Why aren’t the oil rich nations of the Middle East welcoming the so-called refugees. Any logical person could only conclude that this invasion has one sole purpose. The destruction of Europe and the West.
978 2018-06-06 21:34:07 I am not an economic expert but I have lived long enough to know that when oil prices go up and interest rates increase, they can affect each person's bottom line and can even cause a financial recession which we do not need at this time when economy is doing a lot better now.

990 2018-06-06 21:31:39 The point was to increase the price of oil by taking Iranian supply off mkt. Putin wants expensive oil more than anything else. Trump policies are all designed to deliver this. $80 oil = $100 billion windfall for Putin

999 2018-06-06 21:30:19 Would only be a one pager. Nobody would be negatively involved as it would 'only' be a replacement for oil and gas, not competing with it. It would secure ongoing affordable power for all and there would only be negligible, temp. damage (during installation) to the environment.

1004 2018-06-06 21:29:59 Auto correct changes "oil" into "evil" when texting. Co-incidence? haha
1005 2018-06-06 21:29:55 Nailed it!  It's a total pretext in this instance and Trump is abusing this.  Also, the euphemism called US interest means oil.  That term is a close cousin.
1006 2018-06-06 21:29:47 I can change a tire, change oil, & replace brakes. If you don’t know how to do 2 out of the 3 we can’t be together.
1007 2018-06-06 21:29:42 1~ never real proof of that movement 2~that war was put on credit cards 3~ Our soldiers DID fight to win...with horrid gear, not enough armor and for the oil companies.
1008 2018-06-06 21:29:22 Don't praise Stache too soon. He is backed by big oil pipelines.
1009 2018-06-06 21:29:09 You make an argument that is entirely at odds with itself. 
Any credibility lost on the natl level is solely BCNDP's to bear -as is any intl loss of investor confidence. 
Oil industry will power new investment in renewable sources. Soon it'll be "Horgan's apologists"

1016 2018-06-06 21:28:02 Confession: When the guy at the oil change place shows me the dip stick thing and wants me to confirm the new oil level is correct, I slowly nod with a look of approval on my face - but literally have no idea what I’m looking at or signing off on. Anyone else?!

1073 2018-06-06 21:20:43 I mean, there was the failed Bush-linked 2002 coup.
More recently, the US assisted Saudi cheap oil aimed at weakening countries like Venezuela, which depends on oil, which damaged the economy.

1082 2018-06-06 21:18:16 But as long as they keep supplying oil, they’ll get a pass as usual.
1083 2018-06-06 21:18:11 Alice's injustice has been resolved.
As for a child rapist...my personal feeling is regardless of race, creed, color or religion child rapists should suffer the death penalty, preferably by being boiled alive in peanut oil.
1084 2018-06-06 21:17:54 pep has spent 456 million they have spent more then anyone so stop talking bullshit they have brought the league and would not have happened without oil money accept your argument is flawed and go to sleep
1085 2018-06-06 21:17:24 I tried small words...prove is 20% higher than last summer. Summer. Care to explain? Thought we were on the verge of oil independence.
1086 2018-06-06 21:17:14 Does your assumption that supply reduction necessitates a price increase not ignore the concept of price-takers? i.e. as a producer of 0.014, we don’t influence oil price?

1147 2018-06-06 21:09:42 Will the conservatives change the rules and regulations so you can get private oil companies to build Energy East ? And actually get it done ?
1148 2018-06-06 21:09:34 You essential oil nuts are nuts.
1149 2018-06-06 21:09:29 Aww It definitely helps reduce it! I have cbd organic oil based tincture. I dose max for forth of July to help calm him. I have an extra bottle if you want it.
1150 2018-06-06 21:09:22 Economy is great for TheWealthy bc avgAmericans pay their taxes. Wage growth for workers stagnant With fake) unemployment rate of 4%, wages should be rising. Trump & CrookedCongress only support oil companies raising gas prices—workers lose again. Impeach (expel), indict, convict

1152 2018-06-06 21:08:59 the other day, Kirk tweeted that the us is energy independent cause we are exporting 10.4 million barrels of oil per day (mbd)
turns out, that is the amount we produce; we export about 2 - 2.4 mbd, and are , still, a net  importer

how can you take a buffoon like that seriously ?
1153 2018-06-06 21:08:55 When business owners in Baldwin County AL requested Federal assistance after BP's oil spill they sent "therapists" out to counsel. 12 MILLION given to the local mental health services and they sent a Christian couple with ZERO tangible resources to pray with the business owners.
1154 2018-06-06 21:08:54 "If you want to do that then go right ahead. I'm having fun laying here." He's laying in a puddle of oil. What is wrong with this man?
1155 2018-06-06 21:08:47 Pretty sure you’ll start to see overpriced apartment buildings in CMBS by 2020, just in time for the oil price to sag again. Hello North Dakota.
1156 2018-06-06 21:08:40 Coconut oil pulling is amazing and works wonders. 10/10 would recommend.
1157 2018-06-06 21:08:40 How about Baby oil as suncreen
1158 2018-06-06 21:08:38 The smell of coconut oil is always so strong on me
1159 2018-06-06 21:08:28 I work with alot of work experience students and encourage them to think outside of the cao and the points system.Still very much drilled into them.If I was loaded I'd have my own hogwarts with less magic and more life skills like car oil basics and how to deal with being on hold

1162 2018-06-06 21:07:26 Eyelash extensions are very expensive and very damaging to the eyes, you can’t wear eye makeup with them (i.e mascara, liner, shadow) because when you need to wash your face you tend to rub around the lashes. Try a serum for natural growth (Latisse, Babe Lash, castor oil)
1163 2018-06-06 21:07:22 = 1 less Orca - Ya happy now that 'everybody can pick up their tools again'? @RachelNotley Happy to be ignoring & violating #UNDRIP ? Happy to be representing a Texas Oil corporation instead of the people who voted for you? What a fraud @albertaNDP #bcpoli #cdnpoli

1169 2018-06-06 21:06:19 Natural remedies to help cavities via /r/Dentistry

Dentists - have you ever seen cavity being healed from natural remedies such as "oil pulling", "remineralization of teeth", and using "garlic and salt paste" to reverse the effects of cavities?
1170 2018-06-06 21:06:11 I’m 47 & menopausal. I still have acne. I will be swabbing oil off my face when I’m living on social security.
1171 2018-06-06 21:06:10 Seems the oil dividend has improved since the last Indy vote. Or am I wrong in that ?
1172 2018-06-06 21:05:41 #TheTruthAboutCarbs  It's vital to keep Stromberg and SU oil pots topped-up.

(Huh? What do you mean I've misunderstood? )
1173 2018-06-06 21:05:29 Retire then, and let honest men and women run in a free and fair election without fear of your government. One million have fled your failed policies. Your oil industry is grinding to a halt. Your people are starving. Please be honorable and admit your failures.

1175 2018-06-06 21:05:15 Saw a CN train on BNSF tracks with a full train of crude oil heading south. Never seen CN on these tracks before. Taking Alberta crude to CherryPoint, bypassing Chevron?
1176 2018-06-06 21:04:55 I have an oil change at 11 tomorrow
1177 2018-06-06 21:04:46 Sometimes you need a little friction to get the job done. Baby oil reduces the amount of friction. So be careful. 

Measure it out. You don’t want to slide right off the story without making that crucial editing pass... right Gary?
1178 2018-06-06 21:04:36 It has become normal for my mom to walk into the house and shove her wrist into my face for me to smell the new oil she’s wearing. This is my life.
1179 2018-06-06 21:04:18 Im gonna need picture evidence that the oil had been properly applied
1180 2018-06-06 21:04:15 3 bean salad * plus parsley, onion, cucumber, olive oil, red wine vinegar, etc lol

1183 2018-06-06 21:03:52 One of my best friends was there on DDay.  PT Boat Commander.   He didn't like Trump when they met in the 80s. Came across as a snake oil salesman.
1184 2018-06-06 21:03:47 My 2018 Volkswagen Beetle Dune Turbo requires maintenance once every 10,000 miles.  Well, since I'm retired and driving only 2,000 per year, I will bring my Beetle in for service once per year because the oil will degrade over time.  I'm saving so much money as a retiree in WY!
1185 2018-06-06 21:03:40 The lack of articulation may hinder its sales.  I loved those things so much, but i think they would only work to nostalgic collectors. Today's kids need toys that almost play by themselves and today's Oil prices might make them too expensive.  But man, I loved those
1186 2018-06-06 21:03:38 I’ve been waiting over an hour for this oil change and I’m ready to lose my shit
1187 2018-06-06 21:03:34 If any oil patch is left after The Turd is done.

1191 2018-06-06 21:03:09 Just got back from an oil change, after bitching for Maint to look at the roof.  Roof half repaired.  Getting some inquiries to go to Waco for a night, anybody else ready to screen for Waco?  Anywhere else close?
1192 2018-06-06 21:03:01 its between awa legs already, we just wantu change The oil

1202 2018-06-06 21:02:29 .@Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!
1203 2018-06-06 21:02:24 But you're trying to compare apples and motor oil.  The two business models are completely different and work differently.  Yes, Bungie has screwed up in the past and they do not get a free pass, but being an entitled shitter doesn't mean you are owed content.
1204 2018-06-06 21:02:20 Oil fields, might not get you famous but it'll make you rich
1205 2018-06-06 21:02:15 I'm just going to skip that tugging and just slather baby oil all over myself.

1210 2018-06-06 21:00:56 This @MBuhari sense came too late, d4 this year, Nigeria will celebrate democracy day twice. It's even OK because what is the govt doing, let the civil servants continue to enjoy after all the hope of 9ja is oil and Britain shares and gives us.
1211 2018-06-06 21:00:41 After being very busy in the garden over the past few weeks - trying to get work done before the midges arrived - I finally managed to get back into the studio yesterday. These are my latest wip oil landscapes
1212 2018-06-06 21:00:37 I mean it's just as expensive as home, and stuff like groceries are cheaper over here. And ya a train to Edinburgh is £170, so like $200. Gas (petrol) is more expensive BC of the taxes, the U.S has good deals with the middle East for oil prices and here there aren't those deals
1213 2018-06-06 21:00:37 @DennysDiner if i took a fork and poked my biceps, there would be less oil than your sausages
1214 2018-06-06 21:00:25 Even if we got a great return, fans would still bitch and moan. 

Oiler fans gonna Oil.
1215 2018-06-06 21:00:16 Let's start chugging antibiotics when we don't have any symptoms yet!

1220 2018-06-06 21:00:05 Apply jojoba oil for 20 minutes before going to the shower. This promotes fast hair growth!
1221 2018-06-06 20:59:34 Let’s level the playing field. I think Canada which supplies 50% of the oil to USA should sell their oil at market prices instead of the steep discount USA enjoys. Maybe the water and electricity that USA currently pays well below the market price should be renegotiated too?
1222 2018-06-06 20:59:24 Thanks, they are Caliban Green, Nuln Oil, Caliban Green, Warpstone Glow and Moot Green. In that order, thin layers of each color to build up the transition.

1225 2018-06-06 20:58:51 @cathmckenna Minister are you being followed by a free lance photographer during the G7? And don't get too close to the St. Lawrence river. It's full of foreign oil tankers and domestic poop.
1226 2018-06-06 20:58:50 Thank you @RepKClark @BettyMcCollum04 @RepMarcyKaptur for supporting the @NitaLowey amendment to prevent @Interior from moving forward with lease sales in the #ArcticRefuge and keep oil drills off the coastal plain! #ProtectTheArctic
1227 2018-06-06 20:58:43 Have hated the idea of plastic since a kid- look hard for biodegradable. Oil should have remained where it was.
1228 2018-06-06 20:58:40 I  went to a little place called Yellow Chilli and had jollof rice and Pounded yam. I proceeded to have unpounded yam ( is that even a thing?). I also discovered while having the gravy from the fresh fish (something) soup  that my palette is really simple for palm oil. The end.
1229 2018-06-06 20:58:37 I noticed this to. In more specific the plunge in products supplied is due to lower gasoline & distillate fuel oil demand. If you examine the two time series separately, today's drop are not really an anomaly imo.

1231 2018-06-06 20:58:15 I wonder what #Truth smells like to @StormyDaniels probably cum laden pussy juice mixed with stripper oil. #IDK #SpentWhore
1232 2018-06-06 20:58:07 sometimes I wonder if the men think I actually know what they are talking to me about while they change my oil
1233 2018-06-06 20:57:58 I didn’t buy Earth Balance for years because of palm oil  why do they only bring this stuff up to attack vegans?
1234 2018-06-06 20:57:57 You're putting words in my mouth. Nobody thinks this mess is optimal, but until our reliance on oil (and the profits therefrom) has been significantly reduced, there's no point in cutting our noses off to spite our faces. And lamenting what should have been is pointless.
1235 2018-06-06 20:57:34 There are CDB oil dog treats for dog anxiety. I think they're called Dope Dawg. Good for nervous Chihuahuas and big thunderstorms.

1242 2018-06-06 20:56:51 Told this man @davidoweis101 let me use his beard oil and he poured the WHOLE bottle into my hands....
1243 2018-06-06 20:56:48 Gbo-gbo oil money.
1244 2018-06-06 20:56:34 True, but sooner or later even the rubes get wise. That's why snake oil salesmen always had a horse and wagon and not a storefront.  
At least that's what I keep telling myself.
1245 2018-06-06 20:56:31 @POTUS I think you should be mad at the British people, not Canadians. First the war of 1812 and in 2010...BP Oil had the biggest oil spill in history.. #GiveTideas
1246 2018-06-06 20:56:20 I'll give you one. Thank to Trump approving pipelines and fracking permits, approving exploration of resources, along with the growing economy we have upped oil production and are abt to overtake Russia, forcing a problem for OPEC, Russia's Cash cow. Oh wait, that's bad for Russ.
1247 2018-06-06 20:56:16 Plain is really healthy. Just what you put in but homemade is hard to mess up. I like a bit of feta cheese crumbled and chilli oil
1248 2018-06-06 20:56:11 So coconut oil is bad for you now. Stupid "good for you/bad for you" game
1249 2018-06-06 20:56:11 It should make aches and pains go away. Does wonders for my grandma’s arthritis. It’s possible your oil’s not quality, but remember not to be looking for a head high. Try a CBD beverage instead.
1250 2018-06-06 20:55:51 I’m so damn middle class, my 10pm snack right now is a fried hallumi sandwich. Yes it’s fried which is for poor people, but I fried it in coconut oil so there
1251 2018-06-06 20:55:44 Okay, I came back up to check. Turns out “French dressing” is just oil and vinegar, with some salt and pepper.
1252 2018-06-06 20:55:23 #AgeYourselfIn3Words "Check your oil?"
1253 2018-06-06 20:55:15 i might need to look into the dummies more. i've tried vaping and the oil straight but it's the kind with THC removed. maybe i need some of it put back in. LOL.
1254 2018-06-06 20:55:07 Take the oil!
1255 2018-06-06 20:55:04 Dropped boiling hot olive oil on my foot so there’s that... WHERES THE ALOE VERA

1257 2018-06-06 20:54:49 How do you use baby oil without breaking out??
1258 2018-06-06 20:54:39 If your guy changes the oil he can tell you if he uses synthetic or not -synthetic lot more expensive so could be why he asked
1259 2018-06-06 20:54:23 Yet, we have more job openings than applicants. We have plenty of oil & gas. Healthy economy not seen in years. Take another bong hit, Jenny.
1260 2018-06-06 20:54:03 while getting my oil changed an older man sitting to my right said “you know you have 2 computers. the one in your hand & the one in your head. don’t let the one in your hand over power the one in your head” I’ve never heard anything more true than that

1265 2018-06-06 20:53:15 Used to travel to Bahrain from Dammam in Saudi to get visa renewed. Bahrain is connected by a bridge to Saudi and they really cannot afford to upset the Saudis.

1277 2018-06-06 20:50:57 Are they really saying that they cannot operate in the peak months because of no aircraft as planned.....they could both source and impose delivery penalties on Airbus if that we’re the case or is perhaps a combination of demand, yield and oil price more relevant. Be honest!!

1282 2018-06-06 20:50:28 To be fair, to get an oil change degree, a person must demonstrate the ability to put the drain plug back in and fill the car with oil. I don't think Matty-Paradise is that bright.

1288 2018-06-06 20:49:27 I’ll admit in the beginning of my trading career I never understod how they were able to miss their predictions so bad in oil, then I found out about market manipulation and things in the market were never the same. #RedPill

1305 2018-06-06 20:47:24 Might be something to do with the fact that their advertising revenue is literally dripping in oil.
1306 2018-06-06 20:47:23 shouldn't matter that much, put in a blend. Oil likely needs changing soon anyways..

1318 2018-06-06 20:45:30 With all this meth stuff, I haven't said anything about MBIE's paper that says the oil ban will raise worldwide emissions.

For all the reasons I've stated half a dozen times already, this assessment is wrong...

1326 2018-06-06 20:44:28 Religion is not the reason for Venezuelan violence, economics are. The people are starving and in some cases eating dogs. Venezuela has the world's 2nd largest oil reserves and Sociolism has managed to squander it.

1331 2018-06-06 20:43:29 We do need to make smart decisions, but that starts with no cutting off our nose to spite our face.

1337 2018-06-06 20:43:01 Advice please, my @UKNikon #D600 just loves dust. Even when I think I’ve got the sensor clean more dust gets in. Note this isn’t the known oil spots issue, they clean off fine! Any tips on #dslr #cleaning @nikonownermag @AP_Magazine @NikonProEurope @dpreview

1368 2018-06-06 20:39:17 You don't say you took part in "a part of the service" of walmart when you just get your oil changed there. I'm scratching my head at this circular logic. Did they need to try and take part in everything the bakers had to offer to truly be "denied service"?
1369 2018-06-06 20:39:11 I told you why oil prices are high. The benefits only for to Trumps rich friends. Nothing EVER trickles down to the average American. Ever. In fact, we pay more than they do for foods and services.

1417 2018-06-06 20:33:09 “Salad cream is a creamy, pale yellow condiment based on an emulsion of about 25–50 percent oil in water, emulsified by egg yolk and acidulatedby spirit vinegar. It may include other ingredients such as sugar, mustard, salt, thickener, spices, flavouring and colouring.”

1420 2018-06-06 20:32:52 Got to work at 7 so I can’t leave at 3 for my oil change. Just got an email that we have Tiff’s Treats. RIP.
1421 2018-06-06 20:32:21 I think they all should be boiled in oil.

1423 2018-06-06 20:32:12 Or just leave salmon for the whales, they need it more than us. Omega 3's can be found in many other sources; chia seeds, walnuts, flax seeds/oil and black seed oil. Add to a salad or smoothie.

1425 2018-06-06 20:31:51 Putin's a tow rag, Trump's Putins oil rag, if Putin told Trump to jump he'd jump, IMO tow rag is in partnership with the oil rag, tow rag needs to launder billions of dollars where better than the USA with oil rag and his two oil rag sons very willing to assist, tow rag's happy

1427 2018-06-06 20:31:32 @Richzeoli @GREGSTOCKER @DawnStensland well our class in ‘95 decided to pour cooking oil all over the hallways.  We had a bit of a lockdown and some oil dry.

1429 2018-06-06 20:31:22 Yea it's the Alberta engineers and geoscientists. A lot working in the oil and gas industry there.

The naff Forbes headline is clickbait suggesting 'all scientists' etc
1430 2018-06-06 20:31:20 Wow, how backward is the USA? I'm Gobsmacked this is even in question in 2018! #ERANow! Must suck to be a repressive backward nation like those oil rich middle eastern countries that treat their women like crap!
1431 2018-06-06 20:31:17 After months of debilitating anxiety attacks and trying unsuccessfully to get medicated properly, I’m trying my first experience w/ CBD oil and feeling closer to zen than I have with anything so far.

1441 2018-06-06 20:30:20 So eating fish meat and olive oil and fresh vegetables are better than western processed highly refined carbs - for those insulin resistant (which I wasn’t considering as average) Variable not operationalised. But we know where this thread will go
1442 2018-06-06 20:30:17 If you have a dark shirt that's starting to fade, soak it in olive oil.
1443 2018-06-06 20:30:16 Don't have an exact answer. However, I suspect it has something to do with the fact that for "ip igmp join-group", Nexus switches internally deactivate the RPF check, and so need to prevent possible loops by keeping the OIL empty. There were also some bad interactions with LISP.

1447 2018-06-06 20:29:56 My eyes are dry
My faith is old
My heart is hard
My prayers are cold
And I know how I ought to be
Alive to You and dead to me
But what can be done
For an old heart like mine
Soften it up
With oil and wine
The oil is You, Your Spirit of love

1448 2018-06-06 20:29:53 Ahhh there must be lots of money in this latest fad. The great Doctor must know it well! What’s next snake oil cures cancer!
1449 2018-06-06 20:28:58 Honey keep on hating Mani coming to outshine canola oil!!
1450 2018-06-06 20:28:58 Look anyone that supports "Essential Oils" is a fucking conman, from the top guy to the fucking peon...Snake Oil won't fix a damn thing, it's just a pyramid as old as time.
1451 2018-06-06 20:28:53 Girl buy products with lavender oil within them! It’s helped my face so much bc I have super sensitive skin too 
1452 2018-06-06 20:28:50 rosehip oil !
1453 2018-06-06 20:28:41 a guy who introduced himself as Eclipse came by my store’s pop up, sprayed palo santo oil on his 7 major chakras, said a blessing for our store to draw in positive energy, gave me a hug and left
1454 2018-06-06 20:28:38 Your probably right....they don't have a lot to do with each other....kinda like water and oil.  I know your are proud of your grandfather as I am proud of my father for defending liberty.
1455 2018-06-06 20:28:37 Yes. Heart is pressed to refine, remove bitterness to purify "oil" so GOD (Divine PURE Light Truth) can be known.  But Mind must then receive Hidden Knowledge Wisdom Truth so both are in sync, paired Witness so Vessel can be filled withand not of earthly man. Lit Path Feet
1456 2018-06-06 20:28:33 Dripping over oil. Gluten free yes, veggie no.
1457 2018-06-06 20:28:32 Even more of a reason to get our ethically and low carbon produced oil to the world markets. Build more pipelines and reduce the worlds carbon foot print eh.
1458 2018-06-06 20:28:30 I can add light grays for shading so that can work
1459 2018-06-06 20:28:26 Is beard oil safe for pubes?
1460 2018-06-06 20:28:04 @RARE_OIL how many retweets for a job interview? Have a degree in chemical engineering, osha certified
1461 2018-06-06 20:27:48 also tea tree oil
1462 2018-06-06 20:27:14 Let it heal first, and if it leaves a mark Shea butter, witch hazel, aloe vera, bio oil.. all good for fading dark scars. But to heal your skin faster, try to get prescribed Triamcinolone Acetonide Cream at Drugco or Walgreens
1463 2018-06-06 20:27:08 Bio-Oil helps with scars, Walmart has it. Also Vitamin E oil is known to be good too!
1464 2018-06-06 20:27:00 I think I'm over the dude. It's been wayyyyy to long and if one ka tsoga kemo batla gape. I'll make sure kemo invite for breakfast , I'm gonna cook those eggs ka castor oil anyele Hooooray!
1465 2018-06-06 20:26:51 Yes your party - CONgress - has completely slipped in eyes of public. People are questioning RaGa's undisclosed foreign visits & want answers from him why oil prices jumped from 35 in 2004 to 80/lit in 2014. Aur bataiye how's Pidi life going?
1466 2018-06-06 20:26:46 The trade deficit in goods and services came in at $46.2 billion in April, smaller than the consensus expected $49.0 billion. Exports rose $0.6 billion, led by fuel oil, soybeans and corn. Imports fell $0.4 billion, led by cellphones & other household goods, autos, pharmaceutical
1467 2018-06-06 20:26:42 Surely the real snake oil is the stuff your brainwashed slaves rub into your shining scales when you fancy a massage?
1468 2018-06-06 20:26:26 Funny thing was that was the exact amount, $1.40, that I needed to retire... WOO HOOO!!! BARBADOS HERE I COME... RAUL GRAB THE MASSAGE TABLE AND THE COCONUT OIL WE'RE OUTTA HERE.

1470 2018-06-06 20:26:11 We thank @NitaLowey for offering her amendment to #ProtectTheArctic and block oil and gas drilling in the wild and precious Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Oil drilling and wildlife conservation there are irreconcilable, and we will keep fighting.
1471 2018-06-06 20:26:08 Norway is one of the richest because it invested the wealth of North Sea  oil whereas Thatcher's Tories spent oil money on tax cuts, shoring up  their government etc etc
1472 2018-06-06 20:26:01 @realDonaldTrump The oil industry has known for decades that climate change is real, caused by fossil fuels and potentially catastrophic. But that’s not the story it told the public. They should pay for what they have done, not be rewarded.
1473 2018-06-06 20:25:43 Did you anticipate ISIS? You're right, he missed that. What do you think would happen if we didn't need oil anymore? Germany has put solar panels on almost every home. But US is run by oil industry....

1475 2018-06-06 20:25:30 @HydroFlask full of ice water + @doterra lemon essential oil = just the hydration I needed right now! Some days, it's the little things...
1476 2018-06-06 20:25:24 In the coming hours or days the third world war will begin. It is the end of western civilization. All continents are boiling without you noticing.The reasons westerns for triggering wars hogwash, snakes for media gobballs. The quest for oil has made them lose.
1477 2018-06-06 20:25:13 Ugghhh... Some previous customer at the post office had bathed in pachouli oil. Now I can't shed the smell and am about to vomit. Pachouli is just nasty smelling crap that is strong enough to *almost* hide the fact that you haven't bathed in days, but ends up smelling worse.
1478 2018-06-06 20:25:00 i don't think he can unless its prepared with a touch of olive oil and stuffed with butter then he'll draw it with his own hands 5 times a day nobody else should draw it or it won't be nutricious enough

1481 2018-06-06 20:24:36 @GeekyClean do some fantastic oil! Plus loads of nerdy bath/nice smelling stuff
1482 2018-06-06 20:24:33 Been doing a ton of research on the Quebec lithium arena. The first mover advantage that @Nemaska_Lithium has created, could make them a large player in what could be the new oil industry. I think people underestimate how hard it is to get to production; something they will do.
1483 2018-06-06 20:24:30 One of the reasons I dislike Dr. Oz is that he'll take a grain of truth about something and stretch it so far beyond recognition that any sane person can see he's selling snake oil, but because there's *some* truth to it, he can always say "well, this study they did on rats.."
1484 2018-06-06 20:24:25 You need lots of minerals to support the nervous system. Straight celery juice in the morning. CBD oil works quickly for some as well. Worth a shot for sure.
1485 2018-06-06 20:24:16 Aromatherapy. Try peppermint oil. I don't get headaches often but when i had one that wouldn't go away a nurse recommended that and it worked for me.
1486 2018-06-06 20:24:15 I would make sure that the vape was THC oil because nicotine is fucking nasty.
1487 2018-06-06 20:23:57 Markets up today.  Oil down.  Veterans, who wore a uniform to protect me from harm, can see a doctor of their own choice.  Chronically ill can seek experimental treatments.  More money in my pocket.  Trump has done more in 500 days than Obama could in 10 lifetimes.  #MAGA #2020

1489 2018-06-06 20:23:41 Bring the water to a boil BEFORE you put in the spaghetti. Salt to taste. Adding a little oil is to reduce the froth caused by the starch... especially when you don’t use a big enough pot.
1490 2018-06-06 20:23:31 Yeah, _Russia_ did it for the oil! And Venezuela!

You're a peon lying for Israel, and you're ridiculously transparent, ignorant and wrong.

1492 2018-06-06 20:23:12 They say my remedies are snake oil.

1497 2018-06-06 20:22:37 My car has gear and oil consumption issues. My car is under 100km but Audi is not interested. I love my convertible but I can’t justify getting another Audi purely due to their inherent engine issues and lack of customer service.
1498 2018-06-06 20:22:37 There could be and attempt to keep it down here till Friday. Things get tighter every passing week in 80% of the oil market - rest of the world.
1499 2018-06-06 20:22:37 But i actually like the vape pen and thc oil. I feel thats more potent.
1500 2018-06-06 20:22:36 They must’ve used anointing oil to fry that samosa

1530 2018-06-06 20:18:28 That’s not factually accurate. Alberta has not supported any other provinces for any years with oil. I know. I am a former Albertan. And I read ... facts.

1535 2018-06-06 20:18:00 This is whats needed. The SDF and Assad need to make a deal in which the SDF give up the oil fields and Raqqa in return for an autonomous region of their own. They need to join forces once and for all to clear the rest of Syria of terrorists, and the US need to leave with Turks.

1551 2018-06-06 20:16:13 @rotobuzzguy @jimbowdengm Rusty is from the fact that metal moving parts can't move when they are rusty. Put some oil on them and move them, and they move correctly again. Think of the Tin Man getting rusty from the rain and asking for the oil can.
1552 2018-06-06 20:16:13 HUMONGOUS YES! imagine for 5 years he’s nothing but a starlet and nobody until that pabebe wave of MAINE, yan ang Hindi matanggap ng camp nya, rumampa nga with black boxer brief and oil pero isang NGANGA pa din, last week na nya before sa EB that time but coz of the famous pabebe
1553 2018-06-06 20:16:09 It was Tesco motor oil
1554 2018-06-06 20:16:03 In less than a week I will be in Greece and I couldn't be more excited to be loaded up with all that beautiful fresh bread that I can plunge in olive oil and cry with joy over how good it is.
1555 2018-06-06 20:16:02 ok but you’re so hot please fry me in a boiling pot of oil

1557 2018-06-06 20:15:49 I indeed wish it was someone I truly love but nah sis, cooking oil splashed onto my neck while making myself a breakfast

1560 2018-06-06 20:15:42 Not really, its a very one-eyed view. There are other green energy sources that could be used instead of palm oil. The problem is to soft sustainability criterias which create possibility to use cheapest biofuel while ruining biodiversity and rainforest.
1561 2018-06-06 20:15:32 Last year Pierre was reportedly met by oil producers along with other major traders and so he has a seasoned view on this cycle we are going through !
1562 2018-06-06 20:15:29 ...people keep using older, less efficient cars for longer, driving up the oil price still further etc...etc...it's all a horrific web of inter-dependencies.

1564 2018-06-06 20:15:26 The oil would clog the super soaker.
1565 2018-06-06 20:15:24 I've been using Mr. Burberry for a while now for oil and it's been great
1566 2018-06-06 20:15:18 Sat in baby oil for an hour so I could scrub off my tan, and it didn’t even work 
1567 2018-06-06 20:15:14 #DidYouKnow? It's actually natural and beneficial for our hair to have a light oil film.
1568 2018-06-06 20:15:10 My pleasure anytime xx carrot oil at the ready for my day off friday  xx
1569 2018-06-06 20:15:09 My left hook wasn't more precious than oil, but in a Wes Craven movie.  Help!
1570 2018-06-06 20:15:06 Best oil free moisturizers?
1571 2018-06-06 20:14:59 I got myself baby oil so I can use it after I shower and have glowing skin and tbh it smells so nice
1572 2018-06-06 20:14:54 Got my car’s AC fixed, got a car wash, got an oil change, my thermostat is fixed so our apartment isn’t at 88 degrees anymore, and I scheduled a migraine treatment for my head....things are looking 
1573 2018-06-06 20:14:51 @The_UnSilent_ Watching from Canada, I have seen every POTUS since Kennedy, Trump is "unmatched" in every way!  Barry was a "snake oil" salesman, and a good one ! A puppet of the cabal of globalists hell bent on destroying your once great country! Rockefellar admitted it!
1574 2018-06-06 20:14:39 Pasta. Always pasta. (Also recently: oil. Who knew I had a new bottle in the back of the cabinet?)
1575 2018-06-06 20:14:06 I think traders build their beliefs on the oil market through the day to day dealings which is truly a great measure of the oil appetite.... Pierre had been in all curves of the cycles... I am sure he sees things and he sees through things..
1576 2018-06-06 20:14:00 All things, given enough pressure can be reduced down to oil; oil floats on water and fuels the flame of fire.
1577 2018-06-06 20:13:58 Ok. Working with Trump is like fixing a flat by changing the oil. You can put in the work, and some good is technically done, but you're still not going to get anywhere. 

Good call.
1578 2018-06-06 20:13:49 Huge difference between "use" and "waste". Canada has larger oil reserves than the US yet produces a lot less.
1579 2018-06-06 20:13:47 if you put coconut oil into your scalp and your roots and like leave it on overnight and do it frequently it helps grow it a lot

1590 2018-06-06 20:12:24 I remember the 70s. I was there through power cuts as miners fought against a Tory government in the midst of the oil crisis. All @UKLabour options are better than the Tories in power. It seems like your problem is with unions. Personally I think they’re a force for good #NUJ
1591 2018-06-06 20:12:17 Jahan Wilcox's tweets are an interminably fawning love letter to President Trump and Scott Pruitt. Here are some subjects the EPA spokesman hasn't tweeted about this year:
1) pollution 
2) climate change 
3) environmental assessments 
4) education
5) oil spills
1592 2018-06-06 20:12:14 Hello I just shaved, exfoliated, moisturized , and lathered myself in baby oil so pls fucking cuddle w me
1593 2018-06-06 20:12:12 Me too. Time to go get my oil can....I mean a sandwich because I need food to live on a day to day basis like all other humans.

1595 2018-06-06 20:12:06 you should recommend Tongan oil to @Brazzers 
1596 2018-06-06 20:11:49 today at the car dealership while getting my oil changed they thought I was my dead names husband. in that case the bitch needs to step up a do her part in keeping this marriage alive.

1599 2018-06-06 20:11:31 Think ima do a hot oil treatment on my hair
1600 2018-06-06 20:11:27 Yeah I definitely agree with that. I think some companies are trying, like Disney won’t give you a plastic bag anymore in their stores, but plastic is derived from petroleum which is tied to the natural gas industry which is tied to the oil big wigs, yup corrupt
1601 2018-06-06 20:11:26 Rose Hip Oil! Germaine De Capuccini do the best product!! 
1602 2018-06-06 20:11:14 A few prayers for Andi, please! We just admitted her to the hospital. Her hemoglobin dropped very low and her blood platelets were none existent. Rest overnight and transfusions in the morning! Just a little oil change to make her engine run smoother!

1606 2018-06-06 20:10:43 You have a beard just like mine when I let it grow so I'd recommend Brisk beard oil, it smells amazing, doesn't leave it feeling greasy and shapes it really well. Made for grizzly beards!

1609 2018-06-06 20:10:11 Dude, at least read the news. Prime Fuels are the one awarded the KShs. 1.5 B tender to transport the pilot phase crude oil with 100 trucks making at least 3,000 trips. Of course, there's that small matter of Prime Fuels being an offshore reg. co and one known local owner.

1614 2018-06-06 20:09:42 Trump on trade. A message to our "Friends" We want our industry back. Like flat panels for all war planes and goggles. Seems like a small thing but it involves National Security. Steel, Aluminum, Oil and  so forth. Oh yeah and that trade deficit.
1615 2018-06-06 20:09:42 I am a strong supporter of @NitaLowey’s amendment to prevent oil and gas exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. We must do everything we can to protect this wild and pristine land.

1627 2018-06-06 20:08:20 As a guy with very limited budget (being a student sometimes sucks...) and a long hair, I just use argan oil on my beard too. I need it for my hair anyway and it seems to do the job when it comes to my beard as well.
1628 2018-06-06 20:08:16 It’s got crushed biscuits and coconut oil in the base, cut up strawberries, then melt dark chocolate and coconut cream together and pour it over. Easy peasy!

1638 2018-06-06 20:06:31 Baby oil and any kind of lube is always welcome.
1639 2018-06-06 20:06:27 But more than a surplus of $ to bomb brown & black peoples of foreign countries with oil allies!
1640 2018-06-06 20:06:26 No one cares what they are doing, because they are EVIL BIG OIL! Their responsible, environmentally prudent actions just fly in the face of the louder, emotional, headline grabbing eco protesters and SJW! It’s very frustrating....

1647 2018-06-06 20:05:49 One of the drivers for palm oil is as a replacement for hydrogenated veg oil. An excellent start to eliminating palm oil is to read the ingredient list on food products & find an alternate. It’s a personal, mini boycott & companies need to experience a global boycott of palm oil.
1648 2018-06-06 20:05:37 Please be gentle. That guy probably has only a degree in oil change.
1649 2018-06-06 20:05:30 That’s too bad. My husband adopted a very sexy stubbly beard a couple of years ago. Never thought I’d like a beard, but I love it on him, even more so since he learned to groom it properly. Having said that, I bought him Elemis beard oil but I don’t think he uses it regularly

1654 2018-06-06 20:05:04 I'm probably a geek for saying this, but I read up on skunks a couple of years ago. There are different species, ways of them contorting their bodies to spray, 3 warnings before spraying, etc. Oh, they have 7-8 sprays built up, then it takes a week to regenerate the oil.

1670 2018-06-06 20:02:38 Oil prices were plunging even before May 2015 and the admin then strengthened the Non Oil sector for needed cushion. But this was the first thing the Buhari admin attacked when they got in. They started with belligerent Bans which caused panic in the economy & investors cashedout

1672 2018-06-06 20:02:26 Working from the car dealership today. Who knew getting an oil change would take all day. Will be here until 5 or 6. Yuck.
1673 2018-06-06 20:02:16 Petrol price is up due to the high price of oil. Beyond government’s control.
1674 2018-06-06 20:01:52 We need to encircle the Canadians and take their oil. That is the only thing that can be gathered from these statistics.

1676 2018-06-06 20:01:49 Did he shit oil?
1677 2018-06-06 20:01:18 Our heating and oil services started back in 1935, when oil was scarce.
1678 2018-06-06 20:01:16 @jiffylube The Service Center #112 in Baltimore needs to be shut down! Go in for an oil change..leave out car won’t even accelerate  #BadBusiness
1679 2018-06-06 20:01:06 Wait.... We are gonna get the oil and the next thing we are going to add another 400 mps in Parliament, why???? Some government is excited & the next thing we know, we are asking for foreign aid to even transport oil to the refinery.
1680 2018-06-06 20:00:49 @BBCSpringwatch Qu; House Martins arrived on Wed30th May Barnard Castle, building nests out of oil soaked gravel, will this affect the eggs,chicks,fledgelings

1685 2018-06-06 20:00:27 This view is faulty. This is the narrative sold to those who can’t Google. Buhari met the fastest growing economy and turned it into shit as always. He waited 6 whole moths to appoint Ministers even with impending gloom in the oil sector. Please stop spreading falsehood.
1686 2018-06-06 20:00:22 Our girl (aged 9) still thinks the local oil refinery is a cloud factory.
1687 2018-06-06 20:00:19 Ha! Greenpeace hippies will never let you have our oil......they won’t even let us have our own oil.

1698 2018-06-06 19:59:07 a bold move indeed for a province that has no oil and gas to speak of

1701 2018-06-06 19:59:00 I use coconut oil, cheaper and just as good. Good for the skin and smells great, just make sure it's extra virgin and cold pressed.

1707 2018-06-06 19:57:57 To Conquer the Native americans and take the land,they used diseases.

To conquer the Asians, they were introduced to drugs.

To conquer the Arabs and their oil, they started wars.

1730 2018-06-06 19:54:08 On another note, we need to go somewhere and mine for our own oil.

1738 2018-06-06 19:53:34 Considering that the price of gas is mostly the result of global oil prices over which no government Canada has any control using taxpayer money to subsidize them seems a bit reckless. Also how are you going to pay for all the freeways you want no doubt to be built?

Ok.  Idea to fix this.
Lets put a 25% tariff on Canadian oil.  Seeing as Canada exports all its oil to the US & can't export it to other countries (never built the right pipelines) they will be forced..
1809 2018-06-06 19:44:38 By pulling out of NAFTA, we would NOT give the Trumpster a win and hurt his base that voted for this snake oil salesman. We would also definitely lessen the trade deficit with our neighbors down south. He wants a win. We should not give it to him.

1817 2018-06-06 19:43:16 We are as well which is great. Norway is building a huge annuity...lots of options. Oil and gas demand is going up and other countries with poor environmental records meeting supply. Would be much better is Canada did.

1819 2018-06-06 19:42:59 I don't know what the final straw with Scott Pruitt will be, but I imagine it'll either be something huge, like taking money from coal executives, or something incredibly small and petty, like saying Trump has to work with Congress to appropriate money for, like, an oil pipeline.
1820 2018-06-06 19:42:50 All statistics are always from the 4 years of hard work before. So I guess we shall see your dad’s impact in another 4 years.  I know their will be more oil spills and hurt lands/people sick from the fracking he has now allowed.

1828 2018-06-06 19:41:45 the oil on that damn pillar made me smell like lube for a week
1829 2018-06-06 19:41:45 Thankful to have @Jessilyn__23 in my life because she tells me when I need to get an oil change
1830 2018-06-06 19:41:42 It’s a weak argument from her considering they have large amounts of crude oil.
1831 2018-06-06 19:41:40 When you want Canada to abandon oil and gas yet won’t do this yourself I can’t see how this is reasonable. Not trying to be argumentative but smells of “do as I say not as I do” 
1832 2018-06-06 19:41:32 The war On weed is stupid.... make it legal nationwide, and tax it.... regulate it. Hell create an industry where folks can gain employment in that field. I never saw weed as a gateway.

That ignorant oil, aka, Alcohol yes. Too many smoke crack or shoot up, while Drunk.

1834 2018-06-06 19:41:06 it's the same reason you don't have a commission price on your site.  Would you charge the same for a napkin drawing that you would a 10 foot oil on canvas masterpiece?

i mean, I'll take both, but I hope you see what I mean!
1835 2018-06-06 19:41:01 Since barrels and gallons are both units of volume (not mass), the subtance wouldn't matter. Oil, water, potato chips, or monkeys...it's still 42 gallons to the barrel.
1836 2018-06-06 19:40:58 Angola is an oil exporting nation. Get your facts ryt
1837 2018-06-06 19:40:57 I hate coming out of work and smelling like metal and oil

1840 2018-06-06 19:40:28 #PetrolPriceHike South Africa’s other region neighbours and trading partners – Namibia, Botswana, Mozambique and Malawi – have cheaper fuel. This despite the fact that South Africa is the oil to liquid fuel refining, storage and distribution powerhouse of Southern Africa.
1841 2018-06-06 19:40:21 I wanna understand what correlation virginity would even have with baby oil or any kind of oil. Lol
1842 2018-06-06 19:40:19 Geothermal looses efficiency in high density environment. Absolutely useless in a DT core for example. Oil and gas are by far the most efficient. Tech not remotely close yet.
1843 2018-06-06 19:40:18 just got a $60 oil change  why is shit so expensive
1844 2018-06-06 19:40:16 夏とかTシャツに油のシミできるよねえ。あれ透けるからほぼ全裸みたいになるよ僕。

1846 2018-06-06 19:40:01 Honestly he isn't going far enough. Only proper move would be to conquer Canada outright and take their oil
1847 2018-06-06 19:39:46 If shorty pulled up with a care package of lavender incense, coconut oil, shea butter, stones, 2 new books, big bag of raw almonds, sage & a pair of heels >
1848 2018-06-06 19:39:43 When you read history books and see how this country's economy prospered without oil, you tend to find out that the oil discovery/boom was a curse rather than a blessing to us. #Nigeria
1849 2018-06-06 19:39:35 Should gold make a sharp drop that would be a signal. Oil though needs t take out that gap right over or will be owed forever. Over 2800 SPX wouldn’t surprise & gives t right environment.
1850 2018-06-06 19:39:29 When you get that fresh oil change though... feel like you floating in the ocean:
1851 2018-06-06 19:39:28 Before November, MONSTER DEM VOTER TURNOUT needs CHURNING to PUSH THIS BANKRUPTCY KING   Out!! FLIPPING BLUE OUR House & Senate are OUR only HOPE to STOP THIS Greedy SNAKE  OIL SHOW!!
1852 2018-06-06 19:39:23 Being proactive is the only way to run a #restaurant. Why wait for the negative press before getting serious about #safety and training? Food safety preparedness is much like changing the oil in your car; pay for it now, or pay more later.
1853 2018-06-06 19:39:21 Relate with everyone based on who you perceive them to be in love & understanding not in biased feeling & contempt. There is a saying that he who does not tend & carefully nurture the palm tree in his compound would soon be found begging for a cruise of oil. #iDare #ChooseWisdom
1854 2018-06-06 19:39:20 This dude at fucking jiffy lube just TRIED to tell me an oil change would be $90 lmao nigga if you don’t get your hustling ass far the fuck away from me

1857 2018-06-06 19:38:34 No Problem at all . Ben can you arrange some beard oil for Martyn who I’m sure will happily do a tweet in exchange

1862 2018-06-06 19:37:21 What else can be used to treat chronic pain?  CDC took away pain pills, & kratom and CBD oil, made from industrial hemp, are both being attacked.  This war on people, in chronic pain, is inhumane!  Animals are treated better!  #crimesagainsthumanity

1864 2018-06-06 19:37:13 Oooohhhhh honey HONEY! I remember gas prices were low because SA wanted to hit American oil drillers. If you support low gas prices you hate American made gas you fucking scum. Why do you want to put Americans out of work 
1865 2018-06-06 19:36:55 What's the Kikuyu translation for olive ?
I need to teach my mom the benefits of olive oil.
1866 2018-06-06 19:36:48 Over time, I agree that's going to happen but no significant impact for at least the next two or three years. Euro is at far greater risk & Russia will have its own struggles when oil falls to $10 in the next yr. China also faces some significant risks.
1867 2018-06-06 19:36:44 Remember, the US was at DEFCON 3 in January of 2077 and the US was completely destroyed for oil.
1868 2018-06-06 19:36:43 In the owner's manual, what is listed under "scheduled maintenance"?  No oil, fuel injectors, radiator, thermostat, timing belt, etc.  Other than tires/brakes what even needs to be fixed/maintained?
1869 2018-06-06 19:36:27 Do you think that if you used extra virgin olive oil as lube it would become regular olive oil?
1870 2018-06-06 19:36:25 Goes in for oil change, leaves with a quote for four new tires #didntask!

1874 2018-06-06 19:35:45 castor oil!
1875 2018-06-06 19:35:45 Olive oil is nasty and I hate when people cook with it. I won't eat it. Don't like the taste of it at all. It also makes your house stinks too.
1876 2018-06-06 19:35:38 Yes, such beauty.  My mother took a trip there not long before your first, and I could not get over the beautiful colors in her photos.  I am so drawn to the buttery yellows, that I find myself constantly using Naples yellow in nearly all my oil paintings.

1921 2018-06-06 19:31:10 How do we release the tight grip the oil industry has? Most logical people understand we need to move away from oil; we know the tech is available and will stimulate growth. Why is this still an issue given the science, research, and potential?

1942 2018-06-06 19:29:00 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.

1944 2018-06-06 19:28:57 Honey, oil was over $100 a barrel under obama and $5 gas in California. Try to recall 2011. The greedy bastards here are the government who receive more in taxes per gallon than oil companies receive in profits. You may also want to google fabulous Jimmy Carter and the gas lines.

1960 2018-06-06 19:26:45 I hope the oil money really reaches communities.

God loves Kenya.. It must be saved sir.
1961 2018-06-06 19:26:45 Got Brutus' oil changed and tires rotated, signed up for a library card, and got both kids napping around the same time. 

Adulting so hard today. #AmOld
1962 2018-06-06 19:26:17 When I get married my husband has to do all the car stuff, oil changes, paperwork for new cars, taking it for repairs , all of that. I don’t want to do anything but got to the dealership to test drive it, pick it, and go. Anything beyond that gives me anxiety.
1963 2018-06-06 19:26:10 .@SenWhitehouse Koch industries & oil companies are bombarding republican politicians (thanks to citizens united) trying to  prevent climate action & prevent ocean protection  @RepRooney & @RepBonamici agree #CHOW2018
1964 2018-06-06 19:26:10 No. Oil based plastics are the problem. Plant based plastics are the alternative that need to be used.
1965 2018-06-06 19:26:08 Oil me up and throw me in
1966 2018-06-06 19:25:32 prepare pasta yadda, reserve some of the water

1970 2018-06-06 19:25:05 The TV preachers are snake oil salesmen.
1971 2018-06-06 19:25:00 Queen of Canola, Vegetable Oil I running away from the pan
1972 2018-06-06 19:24:55 It really is! Mine loves watermelon & strawberries but goes nuts for Coconut oil & Milk! I can't drink milk anywhere near her 
1973 2018-06-06 19:24:52 My hair is growing so long tea tree oil is a blessing ladies
1974 2018-06-06 19:24:50 “Baking with love it is!” Yes, he’s that lazy. He started adding the water and oil, mixing it slowly. He started humming a song, bouncing on his feet happily.
1975 2018-06-06 19:24:28 Put more oil on me
1976 2018-06-06 19:24:13 Love this! Yes, bees need lavender -- they use the lavender oil to rid themselves of Verroa mite :)
1977 2018-06-06 19:24:10 Hope not Kassian. Oil short on grit. And he has skill. So much energy required for his best game that he looks off sometimes but it's inevitable.
1978 2018-06-06 19:23:55 At Christmas, the officials were demanding goats, rice, oil et al #Number12 #IamAnas
1979 2018-06-06 19:23:22 @realDonaldTrump Canada is the greatest source of imported oil to US!  We supply 1/3 of US soft wood lumber needs. Our oil will be going to the Eastern markets (our new trans-mountain pipeline) as will our softwood lumber! Remember the TPP? We're in! You're out! So sad - for you!
1980 2018-06-06 19:23:03 So dibs on Trump saying Canada is hiding WMDs so they can 'police' Alberta and take the oil he wants.
1981 2018-06-06 19:23:03 Oil Industry will not go down without a fight=The Petro-Chemical Industry is HUGE and is in every area of life today=Eg Plastic,Chemicals,Food............=Its about $ and the Oil Barons are at the top of what can only be described as a Pyramid Scheme=Trump HUGE in Oil Industry!!!
1982 2018-06-06 19:23:02 the impressive strength in junk and ll's is interesting given the recent weakness in oil.
1983 2018-06-06 19:22:51 Oil that puppy up and knead it like pizza dough...

1988 2018-06-06 19:22:14 Hello Christine, thanks for getting in touch! I've just googled and found out from a popular food website that they recommend "Try olive oil, avocado oil or pumpkin seed oil" hope this helps - Andy
1989 2018-06-06 19:22:00 Coconut oil is not good for all hair types!
1990 2018-06-06 19:21:57 More people of color should be invested in the oil industry and the prison Industry
1991 2018-06-06 19:21:54 That's one way of changing the oil.
1992 2018-06-06 19:21:54 Taking a page out of the books of their neighbors in East Africa, Kenya is exploring crude oil drilling in Turkana County and is scouring for viable markets, transporting 156 barrels already to the store house in Mombasa. Kenyatta seems to be getting quite a few things right.
1993 2018-06-06 19:21:52 you should try use jojoba oil instead, ive never had any products with my highlighters & its a more natural alternative
1994 2018-06-06 19:21:43 Huh? I wonder where all Oklahoma’s money went? Seeing what he’s doing with our money in Washington, I’m guessing it was 10 times worse here. Of course #FailinFallin has her own pockets full of big oil money so she wouldn’t have noticed the money falling out of his pockets!
1995 2018-06-06 19:21:39 But like you said...Tax payers suffer...It's no secret that first oil isn't going to be smelt by Ugandans  ngaha!! ..But we are feeling it from the recent social media tax...It's nothing but political propaganda to pay for all this money we borrowed 
1996 2018-06-06 19:21:23 (i'm so jealous, when i am in united states goat cheese is so damn expensive. anyhow):

ingredients: penne, 1.5lb chicken, juice and zest of a lemon, half a red onion, cup of frozen peas, 2+ cups fresh spinach, 4oz goat cheese, dill, olive oil, salt and pepper

2014 2018-06-06 19:19:15 Yes, but toddler finger's owners ( wallstreet, big pharma, oil, gold, war industry ) knew It first, and they are working hard at ir.
2015 2018-06-06 19:19:13 Hehe how bad did u feel after seeing 100% total compliance of SIT-AT-HOME on 30th of May? why afraid of a Referendum?  Civil disobedience is a powerful weapon, we will cripple nig, Biafra territory is for Biafrans,  why are Northerners afraid? U guys can;t survive with oil money?
2016 2018-06-06 19:19:12 Observational/developmental assessment can never be used to produce normative/summative data. Like oil and water they don’t mix.
2017 2018-06-06 19:19:09 I would totally be up for using my own containers to buy things in the store I buy almost every time. I hate throwing away perfectly good food containers. I use some to deal with oil cooking grease and paint pots but most just go into the recycling bin or garbage

2024 2018-06-06 19:18:09 I suggest tree tea oil for your scalp. If the smell bothers you, purchase peppermint OR lavender oil and mix it with the TTO.
2025 2018-06-06 19:17:39 i wanna hit my oil so bad but i’m not tryna look shmacked in these proms flicks

2027 2018-06-06 19:17:29 trump is just the loser e lee of big oil secession from reality.
2028 2018-06-06 19:17:23 True. Oil power for transportation will go beyond 10 years. But the demand will drop by then, prices will collapse and that's bad news for oil sands...
2029 2018-06-06 19:17:11 .@RepDWStweets supports @chelliepingree's amendment to #ProtectOurCoast from offshore oil and gas drilling. Notes threat of offshore drilling to Florida communities.
2030 2018-06-06 19:16:57 Oh I thought you meant standard oil. Thanks for clarifying.
2031 2018-06-06 19:16:42 @SeasonSardines I purchased several packets of your skinless & boneless Sardines in olive oil and at the bottom of the container were a ton of bones! If you’re advertising boneless then it should be and I would like my money back. Thank you.
2032 2018-06-06 19:16:28 So, if a studentr in my home shows violence , extremism or even not being politically correct, you are going to take my guns out of my safe, out of my house. Why?, my guns are locked up cause ya know they might sneak out and rob a gun store for gun oil, that shit is addictive.

2034 2018-06-06 19:16:25 Listen Mike, every time you oppose climate change initiatives, you're the politicizing it; not the other way around. The only people who have anything to lose, are literally the trillion $$$ oil industry giants who are providing fuel to the entire world, and at great cost.
2035 2018-06-06 19:16:14 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
2036 2018-06-06 19:16:08 Ugh that sounds so nice, i do have an oil plug so i wouldn’t mind just buying straight up oils but it’s definitely easier to use what i would already get. And that pure THC hits like a motherfucker
2037 2018-06-06 19:15:59 Every place I’ve gone today says it will be hours before I can get my oil changed. It’s Wednesday in the middle of the day, why? I’m very perplexed.

2041 2018-06-06 19:15:44 I once got about $1,700 from a class action involving my car. Manufacturer had recommended wrong kind of oil. I had the repair bill and records to be fully reimbursed.
2042 2018-06-06 19:15:41 My uncle visited today, gave me 10k in front of my parents, this evening on his way from work, popsy called me to borrow him 500 and buy oil for generator before he comes.... Why are African parents like this
2043 2018-06-06 19:15:38 And you would not be able to drive or use your phone, or, for that matter, use anything made from or using oil or gas in any way. What a bunch of AB haters. Time to clean the lily pond.
2044 2018-06-06 19:15:24 The swirling oil freaked me out. I couldn't process it. Do it again!

2047 2018-06-06 19:15:09 Whoever is praying for Kenya, keep praying. Political enemies are shaking hands, the corrupt are being charged and the proud are being humbled, part of oil profit is going to local communities! #GodsaveKenya
2048 2018-06-06 19:14:45 Sir, week ago most of them knew about the Rate hike due to surge in crude oil, which led to inflation. And market had already discounted....

2058 2018-06-06 19:13:34 So, my hope, in this recent "Trump hates Canada" bullshit, my country has the backbone to tell Trump to fuck off and call his obvious bluff. They need Canada's oil a hell of a lot more than we do.

2094 2018-06-06 19:07:55 I'm now trying to think of what I'd add now. I wish there was a really good, deep gallery on oil, not sure why that wasn't on my list back then.
2095 2018-06-06 19:07:47 An adapted Naked Chef recipe that uses a jalepéno/peanut/cilantro chutney instead of horseradish! I also roast them with an olive oil/cumin/garlic marinade. Anti beeters always ask “what r these carrot like things? They’re great!”

2113 2018-06-06 19:06:02 Not thought about that so much. But if cement and coal edge down, and oil and gas grow, it could come some years after a CO2 peak?
2114 2018-06-06 19:05:57 You can take the oil, and we'll share the weed. Syrup is overrated. But touch my poutine, and there will be hell to pay, you hear me!!??

2117 2018-06-06 19:05:31 Got to Nissan at 10am for an oil change. Service rep asked me what I needed and I told them I need an oil change. "Cool, just wait inside and we'll get to you in a moment"

4hrs later "were understaffed and it will take between x-xhrs to service your car"

Wtf @SAustinNissan

2129 2018-06-06 19:04:24 It’s reported airlines are increasing fares due to rising costs in oil. It would be nice if they lowered fares when oil was lower instead of garnering higher profits for themselves. @AmericanAir @Delta @SouthwestAir #roadtrip #impossibletofly #unfairairfare #CutFuelTaxes #Airfare
2130 2018-06-06 19:04:18 I did but the rubberized grips started coming off. Read up on it and it's a very common problem. Oil in our skin causes the grip material to expand and warp. @Microsoft just pretending they don't know what thousands of people are talking about when they get upset.

2139 2018-06-06 19:02:44 The amount of thermal coal they ship creates almost the same amount of GHGs as the oil sands are currently but environmentalists apparently have no problem with that.

2235 2018-06-06 18:48:19 Wow!

Virgin olive oil has the lowest smoke point of all the cooking oils, it's a struggle to keep it from smoking on my stove.

I've been thinking about switching to something tougher specifically for high-heat dishes.

2237 2018-06-06 18:48:12 The War of 1812, really? Europe and Canada need to push the U.S. into recession , NOW. If the GOP win the congress in november, it will be worse. Yes, they too will be in recession, but better to swallow a small pill now. Punishing tariffs, cut off the oil. Make it hurt, TOMORROW
2238 2018-06-06 18:48:00 One day we really have to write this all this stuff down - as well as Binzo and mine great uncles oil tank speculation

2247 2018-06-06 18:46:26 I have never in my life seen olive oil smoke
2248 2018-06-06 18:46:20 Its not a filter, i used an oil brush for my background and somehow the texture moved to the foreground i decided to keep it since it looked pretty good.

2250 2018-06-06 18:46:08 They’re all small time grifters looking for the large easy payout, just not smart enough to do it without getting caught.  All snake oil and used car salesmen (with apologies to the legit snake oil and car salesmen out there!)
2251 2018-06-06 18:46:05 the music is going to get more dance worthy considering future supply and demand dynamics, which finds its way into the price - global middle class explosion and green energy needs - best time to buy oil was when stockpiles were high - perhaps current supply is an opportunity?
2252 2018-06-06 18:45:54 Are you getting smoke off of olive oil?

If not, it's less hot than what I generally see recommended on der youtubes.
2253 2018-06-06 18:45:43 Guess I get up and take me a shower in a minute. I need to go get me a oil change.
2254 2018-06-06 18:45:42 I should be elated bout this oil in our beloved country, but then again what If  these cartels are the majority who gonna benefit #OilYetu

2295 2018-06-06 18:41:54 I would imagine commodities esp oil going thru the roof should this happen. Best way to get inflation in the system at once is to jack up the price of oil. What does the fed do with igniting inflation? The only choice they would have is to raise rates dramatically.

2332 2018-06-06 18:38:43 "Hollywood elitist"? Try self-made millionaire. Why is it that when someone makes money poisoning the environment selling oil or conning people in real estate you call them successful businessmen, but if someone finds success in entertainment they are an elitist?

2345 2018-06-06 18:37:02 Your so-called 'ocean protection plan' is just a $1.5 billion taxpayer subsidy to the foreign owned oilsands, something you promised to eliminate.

2346 2018-06-06 18:36:58 Sounds like an outdated 'peak oil' approach, when what's needed is more of a 'post oil' mindset.
2347 2018-06-06 18:36:51 @JustinTrudeau with all due respect, there is no world class clean up on oil and certainly not on bitumen!  The best interest of Alberta is not the best interest of British Columbia!

2351 2018-06-06 18:36:19 i think we overcorrected the other way: we used to STAY with too much olive oil and now we never have any because we assume that we have too much.

2376 2018-06-06 18:33:33 Farm Fact Of The Day: generally, the hotter the region where the olives were picked, the bolder the flavor of olive oil.

2380 2018-06-06 18:33:13 Aglio e Olio - still one of my favorite #dishes. Super-cheap, easy to prep, but with olive oil not even unhealthy. Preparation time under five minutes, tastes delicious and spends a lot of healthy energy with the right type of noodles. And you may add some vegetables too!

2390 2018-06-06 18:31:24 Today in #QP I reminded @JustinTrudeau that climate leaders don't :

2. Facilitate millions $$$ bonuses for oil execs 
3. Break election promises

2395 2018-06-06 18:30:49 It’s a manifestation of antisocial tendencies common to political outsiders. The whining that people were not already marching in the streets or actively trying to “fight the system” before Trump showed up is asinine. Cutting off your nose to spite your face etc.
2396 2018-06-06 18:30:48 True, but then we'd have the 80M Mexicans. Maybe we can just take the oil fields?

2401 2018-06-06 18:30:30 Rolling Thunder was just here to check like the their “Community Spotlight” check.  We collected $5 from every oil change in the month of April.
2402 2018-06-06 18:30:30 My first words were oil.
2403 2018-06-06 18:30:26 Oil and water
2404 2018-06-06 18:30:26 @thehispanist It's somewhat amazing that most don't realize how many actions around WWII were simply about oil. Why did Hitler attack Russia? Why did Japan fight? I guess I shouldn't be surprised that the headlines were spicier and people are blinded by them.

2414 2018-06-06 18:29:04 Yes troll and we supposedly can’t afford to fund the VA or other social programs now because we really needed to give oil companies a $14 billion tax break so they would keep gas prices low. Now we still pay higher prices at the pump plus we get all our earned benefits erased.
2415 2018-06-06 18:29:03 and oil doesn't move...
2416 2018-06-06 18:29:00 I may be biased but does anyone actually buy tuna packed in oil??

2419 2018-06-06 18:28:28 If I say God bless you,  I don't know if it would be enough... You brain has too much oil. 
2420 2018-06-06 18:28:27 Thought I was using tanning oil at the lake yesterday, woke up to orange splotchy legs.. it was self-tanning lotion 
2421 2018-06-06 18:28:25 In fact, the highest peak ever on oil prices was only 6 months into the Obama administration. So it was rising during Bush's last term, and peaked 6 months into Obama's first term.
2422 2018-06-06 18:27:55 Cute. Real cute, but seriously... use oil of oregano!

2427 2018-06-06 18:27:14 I ended up taking 2 basic college biology courses in order to comprehend all of the stuff my body went through that led to my depression, Zoloft not "curing" me, but a vitamin B supplement doing it. As I learned, I went from also adding fish oil to changing to a DHA supplement.
2428 2018-06-06 18:27:14 Ohhh is this oil slick hair?! It is beautiful!
2429 2018-06-06 18:27:14 North is known as a region that's good in forging figures to steal oil money. Remember, I am from the North so I know what am talking about.

2440 2018-06-06 18:25:46 Pruitt sold his soul at a young age.  
Like Dr. Faustus, he finds his bargain costlier than imagined.  Oil money helped him become Attorney General of OK.  He in turn sued the USEPA for Big Oil and parlayed that into a job destroying the agency. /1
2441 2018-06-06 18:25:45 Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! Try ginkgo. It’s supposed to help. Helps memory too.
2442 2018-06-06 18:25:41 So glad i have friends who are mechanics so i don’t get ripped off when i get oil changes  yeah i don’t need an oil flush bye
2443 2018-06-06 18:25:41 It is illegal and hostile because they dinged two sectors actually more that two sectors required for national security oil and steel. Do you want to know about our tech industry ?
2444 2018-06-06 18:25:40 Or the SACRIFICE is Vay Kek in mankini asking you to put oil on his buttcheeks
2445 2018-06-06 18:25:40 jongin rubbing some baby oil on his ankles and feet just for me to watch, my type of porn indeed
2446 2018-06-06 18:25:36 Can’t we grow up and get past the divisive nature of things like race/ religion etc . We should be working together to help keep this planet from being ruined not squabbling about god and oil. Pathetic ! PATHETIC!
2447 2018-06-06 18:25:36 Says Ogoni oil well
2448 2018-06-06 18:25:04 Oil and rates decoupled.
2449 2018-06-06 18:24:54 I use my #prettyprivilege to get discounts on oil changes 
2450 2018-06-06 18:24:47 What do you suggest as an alternative to oil and gas?
2451 2018-06-06 18:24:46 They look so good. Then you fire up that gruff and uncouth lump. It’s like discovering the prettiest girl in the office has the kind of raging halitosis that could peel the paint off an oil tanker at a hundred paces. The SLK320 manual, on the other hand #nicefromfarfarfromnice
2452 2018-06-06 18:24:38 accidentally splashed hot oil all over the stove, the floor, and my arm

2455 2018-06-06 18:24:13 the question is will Kenyans even get to utilize oil produced within their own country. there's too much bureaucracy around this
2456 2018-06-06 18:24:10 ^ also it helps if you actually shower and clean your jewelry and ears. Ears are naturally stinky due to buildup of wax, sebum (skin oil), and dead skin cells. As long as you actually practice good hygiene, there shouldn't be any particular smell.
2457 2018-06-06 18:23:57 Then Germany and France went in on Russia screwing the Ukraine and U.S. With Nordstream while Russia getting oil from Iran . Macron signs a huge oil deal with Iran . Obama and eu screwed this country .
2458 2018-06-06 18:23:27 ... like oil company ads after terrible spills
2459 2018-06-06 18:23:18 I forgot we even went in June  I got turned away at the restaurant because I had oil on my clothes 
2460 2018-06-06 18:23:09 Gotta lay off the oil teehee
2461 2018-06-06 18:22:52 Oh, yeah. . . and my Oil of Olay Age Defying moisturizer with SPF 15 ALSO has oxybenzone, which damages coral reefs. It's going in the trash, too. . . . . never did work anyway! Ha!
2462 2018-06-06 18:22:52 Have to agree it's bloody awful, so glad we have olive oil and balsamic vinegar to dress a salad.
2463 2018-06-06 18:22:46 @POTUS Stop this ridiculous move to increase oil drilling. BP already devasted the Gulf coast, now you want to see the East and West coasts ruined as well? Basic humananity and common sense should overpower greed and money. Or is that to much to ask @realDonaldTrump
2464 2018-06-06 18:22:30 Oil was down Wednesday after reported increases in US crude inventories.
Meanwhile, OPEC is considering raising output.

2466 2018-06-06 18:22:14 I would, but Norway isn't technically EU. Just EEA. Because Norwegians love their oil and their fish. Fish oil? >.> #SaveLucifer #PickUpLucifer!
2467 2018-06-06 18:22:05 With allies, they need to play ball. EU wants Iran oil.
2468 2018-06-06 18:22:04 Olive oil or vegetable oil. I always have at least 3 bottles in the crib at any given time.
2469 2018-06-06 18:21:58 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
2470 2018-06-06 18:21:55 I look it up they said cooking oil and stuff soap and water should work I’m gonna try it then get on. You have me added?
2471 2018-06-06 18:21:48 Congratulations Mr. President... Now tell us how long should we wait before some billions are lost from this? I know some corrupt goons are waiting to exploit this country coz of the oil then you'll say "we can't condone this blah blah blah"

2474 2018-06-06 18:21:35 ...that far.  But it says. "This oil is unfltered. Any sediment you may find is simply crushed olives.”  Just so you know it’s not an uncommon occurrence.

No worries and sorry for the surprise.  I know it’s not something really attractive to look at.
2475 2018-06-06 18:21:30 Has anyone used CBD oil for injuries/anxiety/other reasons?
2476 2018-06-06 18:21:12 I'm a fan of feta in greece with good tomatoes, onions & cheese oil. Just love the fish/ seafood with it
2477 2018-06-06 18:21:03 Pence’s version of the Monroe Doctrine = “We bully our way to victory over the Western Hemisphere.” The more obnoxious he becomes the more the world can see the dire state of the petrodollar. What’s the currency Venezuela is trading oil in these days? 
2478 2018-06-06 18:20:59 The power of oil, causing so much war, derives from a tsunami of desire for suburban car-dependent life. This tsunami can be diverted by offering #carfree #cities.
2479 2018-06-06 18:20:50 Cruet Bills

2481 2018-06-06 18:20:37 Rich people have always been able to influence politics, mostly through social circles, etc... But Right-Wing Texas oil money used to drive a lot of politics here in the 50s/60s.

2484 2018-06-06 18:20:17 There've been many trade skirmishes which took place within the rules of the game. IMO, this is a rogue trade war which introduced immediate price shocks, so it's more like the OPEC oil crisis.
2485 2018-06-06 18:20:16 Seaspan...Hundred thousand oil workers with skills are transferrable to shipbuilding, won’t go to Vancouver and work there for the same reason.
2486 2018-06-06 18:20:08 Repo rates hiked. It was not supposed to. Not with those years of additional tax and low oil prices. Where the fuck did the money go?
2487 2018-06-06 18:20:03 Yeah. That whole thing about not going further east when "we" and the Navy were at their weakest had nothing to do with logistics, oil, or the logistics of oil. Nope. None at all.
2488 2018-06-06 18:20:03 I’d pay good money for the chance to oil you two up and be the ham in the middle of yo hairy sandwich
2489 2018-06-06 18:19:59 Helps get smooth and oil free skin: Beat one egg-white until stiff w/ lemon juice. Apply on your skin for 20 mins. Rinse w/ lukewarm water.

2493 2018-06-06 18:19:34 And then turn it over to the oil companies(looked at gas prices lately); and the banks, and other large companies.
2494 2018-06-06 18:19:27 Looks to me like Tom made something of himself, which is why he doesn't have to follow a con man who is selling snake oil. Only losers who blame their lack of accomplishments on others (like the government) are gullible enough to get conned. #Sad

We can handle some economic pain while we look to export our food, oil, lumber, aluminum etc elsewhere, anywhere. Let's keep our electricity too and lower rates for Canadians. We didn't pick a fight or want this.

2503 2018-06-06 18:18:13 Well it's certainly not the wee cranky is it she has no clue on how Scotland could fund itself the oil industry has collapsed
2504 2018-06-06 18:18:07 NYS scam was a bait on our psyches. Calculated to enrage us. Ask, who was giving NMG leads in daily doses? Second, where are the major beneficiaries? This is a political warfare towards elimination of a key apolitical force. It's all about OIL control beyond 2022.
2505 2018-06-06 18:18:02 Obama opened the door to Iran converting oil revenues to Dollars, and those Dollars were used to purchase items to continue their  Incursions into Iraq, and to provide materiel in support of Assad.  The monetary transfers into US Dollars  remain off limits unless licensed.
2506 2018-06-06 18:18:00 Teaching young children and then working with somebody on the Autism spectrum is exhausting. I am also trying to create a solid portfolio of oil paintings while exercising and taking care of my mental health AND planning the wedding of my dreams.

2509 2018-06-06 18:17:48 They had to abandon oil tankers on the way to Pearl, just to get the planes off the carriers at their maximum distance.

But yes. A wholesale invasion of the US mainland was totally plausible. 
2510 2018-06-06 18:17:45 Will try that. I use tea tree oil and I keep aloe vera plants
2511 2018-06-06 18:17:44 I don't like either. Too small and fiddly, feels wrong in my mouth. I just go home and use a proper fork.

(Don't like eating them with fingers because oil on my hands is something I can't deal with.)
2512 2018-06-06 18:17:26 @fredpalmercoal, the man that served as senior VP of gov't relations at Peabody Energy when it went bankrupt, says @realDonaldTrump is right to focus on coal for nat'l security over "green ideology". He ignores that clean energy initiatives could get us off foreign oil.
2513 2018-06-06 18:17:20 Why do your products contain palm oil?
2514 2018-06-06 18:17:17 Spent $480 on two pit tickets, one of my tickets got oil on it and the barcode faded and @MoheganSun in CT would not let me in. Even after I showed them proof of purchase and ID. Still got in but had to sit way back sucks!!!

2520 2018-06-06 18:16:07 11 secret herbs and spices and a shitload of salt and oil.
2521 2018-06-06 18:16:04 @mikexingchen  Ok Mike l forgive you for getting me hooked on hot oil. However you never talked about Spicy Chilli Crisp.  Extreme good on anything
2522 2018-06-06 18:16:00 And Big Mouth load theirs with this sesame oil, mayo type sauce; green onions and loads of sesame seeds. FLIP. 
2523 2018-06-06 18:15:55 You’re no oil painting yourself, love.
2524 2018-06-06 18:15:54 its tym we consider using bikes and travelling in groups if u are to save on fuel,oil is close to $80 per barrel, no increases
2525 2018-06-06 18:15:42 If you took an oil drum and filled it with cauliflower it would be worth close to $200. Just sayin
2526 2018-06-06 18:15:33 Check your Transmission oil this Sunday.
2527 2018-06-06 18:15:18 So we got what kind of deal from oil
2528 2018-06-06 18:15:10 Your dad was more precious than oil, but I saw my dad. I do!
2529 2018-06-06 18:15:05 funny thing to me at least was US demand growth was running at around 2.5 (on a 4q change basis) from 14 on (admittedly it dipped in 15 when oil investment fell sharply).   absent the -0.5 pp drag from nx, would have been above 2 easily ...

2531 2018-06-06 18:14:56 Tongan oil is different from baby oil here in America  if you use Tongan oil, it won’t dry because of how thick it is, but if you use regular oil, it’ll dry up because it’s suppose too. Has nothing to do with your virginity lmao
2532 2018-06-06 18:14:52 I need to get beard oil ASAP...this thing is not growing at the rate i want it to
2533 2018-06-06 18:14:46 Havent tried the syrup or oil yet, @RecklessxTx
2534 2018-06-06 18:14:46 Den set up bookshop and sell Bible and olive oil
2535 2018-06-06 18:14:45 Update on Evo: still won’t start even with a base map. Might be a fuse or something but he’s still unsure.
Has an oil leak so needs a new upper AN feed.
If all goes well, she’s getting tuned tomorrow evening.
2536 2018-06-06 18:14:36 Try the coconut oil. I use rose oil on my face and I love that too
2537 2018-06-06 18:14:36 Thank you and thanks to Bob for getting me interested in oil painting! <3
2538 2018-06-06 18:14:35 For 3 days

Homeboy got a job there and I went with him for orientation...told em they musta lost my paperwork and they still gave me a job

4days later I ran out the back wit 2 buckets of pickles/500 patties/8 bags of chicken breasts/4 boxes of oil/4 boxes of nuggets
2539 2018-06-06 18:14:33 Ahhh, it's awful! The sweetest (temporary) relief i can offer is a super hot shower with some peppermint oil drops in it, it relieves alllll congestion for just a little bit!
2540 2018-06-06 18:14:26 Every time I want to fry something I think I need to buy a bunch of new oil. I have about 6 half full containers of vegetable oil now 
2541 2018-06-06 18:14:23 Coconut oil won’t help alone but it does synergistically when it’s w/ turmeric & tea tree oil. Coconut oil is super anti inflammatory & antibacterial but it’s very light. The turmeric comes into play here
2542 2018-06-06 18:14:09 this article does not actually specify how or when they will be switching from using palm oil nor does it say when they are going to source directly from farmers. A lot of talk, where's the action?
2543 2018-06-06 18:14:03 What you are saying is you have enough oil for yourself and no one else deserves any. 

People won't take you seriously until you remove the pipelines going to your houses.
2544 2018-06-06 18:14:03 Oh I'm sorry.... I'll tell my son to make sure he reads the terms and conditions before he gets in the bus...... Anything else you can buy at a supermarket and not get on the bus with....cooking oil?.... Chocolate milk shake...? .. Glue.? .. Best put a sign up so we all know...
2545 2018-06-06 18:13:58 That's an idiotic rebuttal. Drugs are damaging - and illegal. Oil (fossil fuels) has greatly improved our quality of life and raised billions out of poverty.
2546 2018-06-06 18:13:52 Why is kenya  exporting crude oil ?
2547 2018-06-06 18:13:40 Watch out for Mr Corruption’s (Pruitt) oil wells and coal mines?
2548 2018-06-06 18:13:38 Petrol bunks in Kanchampuram and pudukadai, both are Indian oil retail outlets.  Who will check the quantity of petrol from these petrol bunks?  Indian oil?

2553 2018-06-06 18:12:48 My chest is so sexy. Just rubbed baby oil allover my pecks.
2554 2018-06-06 18:12:27 @EnigmaMPC ....likely a much better return than that oil company.  Check it out.
2555 2018-06-06 18:12:22 Mostly the oil.
2556 2018-06-06 18:12:21 I'm going to look into the hormone treatment u mentioned. Coconut oil doesn't help my skin but I will definitely try to make a paste with the tea tree. Witch hazel works in certain areas but not allq

2560 2018-06-06 18:12:03 Finally watching Lady Bird while diffusing citrus essential oil with my window open because it’s lovely out. 
Days like today are a gift 

(Also at the part where they’re crying and laying in a field while listening to Dave Matthews Band and unfortunately I relate)
2561 2018-06-06 18:12:00 Neem oil smells like the instant mi goreng and i don't really want that on my face to treat acne.
2562 2018-06-06 18:11:59 Except we don’t even have the oil, so...
2563 2018-06-06 18:11:58 Do you really think there were no Labour war criminals pre Blair?
MacDonald cracked down on India trying to crush independence & trade union movement
Attlee carried out bloody acts in multiple countries
Wilson supported genocide in Biafra for cheap oil
Were they not Real Labour?
2564 2018-06-06 18:11:49 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.
2565 2018-06-06 18:11:48 Lol something like that if it's the top part on the engine where plugs go in. The mechanic said it has mixed water with oil. The fan belt broke and i had to drive a few kms to get help

2568 2018-06-06 18:11:37 @KoinangeJeff @citizentvkenya why is kenya  exporting crude oil ?
2569 2018-06-06 18:11:35 HOW have they cut greenhouse gas emissions by 30%? It didn't say? Also, are they switching ingredients from palm oil? Or using other methods than fire-clearing? The devastation palm oil causes isn't just environmental, ppl lose homes due to the wildfires caused by palm oil farms
2570 2018-06-06 18:11:35 I watched the 2010 Lucas Oil Slick Mist 200 last night.
And, oh... it was bad as everyone said it was back then!  WAY TOO MUCH Ms Almost-Should've-Could've-Would've, as they had said.
2571 2018-06-06 18:11:35 I was not talking about oil 
2nd I have been around long enough to have seen other trade wars and have survived
2572 2018-06-06 18:11:28 Think you have plans when you’re dating a man in the oil field, well guess what here some a rig move on days off. FML....
2573 2018-06-06 18:11:20 avocado + black seed oil + cacao powder face mask seems nice

2575 2018-06-06 18:11:14 I didn’t say you gave up, I said I didn’t want you to give up b/c there’s hope in healing them. 

I’m happy you’ve found some remedies, I know you’re taking turmeric capsules, you can topically apply it too (mix it w/ coconut oil & tea trea to make you a paste)
2576 2018-06-06 18:11:02 There’s a large central oil tank for heating which is covered by the management charge (a comfort union). The tanks are owned by the management company so we’ve all got to get our own, and because we can’t buy in bulk we all have to pay more for the oil now.
2577 2018-06-06 18:11:01 PSA 
ACV ( apple cider vinegar)bath for a toddler 2 1/2 years old works on a rash. After pat drying, use coconut oil on rash area. You will see a major difference in the morning.(less rash).Under the age of 2 I would use coconut oil only. #ACV #Organic #Kids
2578 2018-06-06 18:10:56 Imagine living right by state oil and going to school everyday lol bye dropping out
2579 2018-06-06 18:10:31 Pro Tip: Even in the summer weather can be still an issue. After hot, dry days roads can get instantly slippery during and after a rainstorm because of dirt and oil on the pavement. Be careful - the roads will stay slick until all the dirt and oil washes away.
2580 2018-06-06 18:10:28 Bitch Change the oil on your car don’t try to change me
2581 2018-06-06 18:10:27 Those thinking that the prices of petrol or diesel or cooking gas will drop soon just because Tullow discovered oil in Turkana are lliving in Yonderland. Nigeria is Africa's biggest Oil producer yet they still have high inflation rates. #OilYetu
2582 2018-06-06 18:10:21 髪がさーサラサラしてるのちょっと気にしてんだよなー
2583 2018-06-06 18:10:13 We eat so much crap anyway. Palm oil, coco oil (even worse!!), aspartam, way too sugared and way too salted foods, additives, pesticides etc.....Even tap water isn’t safe (nitrates, chlore, lead....).
2584 2018-06-06 18:10:07 迷うなあサラダ油なの？ごま油なの？どっちが好きなの？
2585 2018-06-06 18:09:41 i might spend some money and go get fried rice...im craving oil. something to fill my belly.
2586 2018-06-06 18:09:41 We are now the biggest in the world producer of oil.  As far as why gas prices are high I’m not sure.  OPEC is keeping them high.  I know that at one point President Trump did release some gas from the reserve.  We do have to have a reserve for emergencies.
2587 2018-06-06 18:09:26 Does anyone have experience working with oil paint?
2588 2018-06-06 18:09:24 Cooking with garlic olive oil is amazing too
2589 2018-06-06 18:09:20 If Canada oil & gas companies can’t be profitable without being subsidized they shouldn’t be in business and now with the Kinder Morgan buyout the Canadian government is in the oil industry.
2590 2018-06-06 18:09:16 Trudeau is  an oil monger trying to look by doing thw apology tour to cover his oily slimey trax
2591 2018-06-06 18:09:00 Why are we giving hand outs to the wealthiest businesses in the world?  Hand outs for big oil?  Why are my tax dollars given to those who don't need it?  So politicians can pay their way through the corruption at the top.
2592 2018-06-06 18:08:42 Green beans with olive oil and a wee bit salt is my new favourite thing.

2597 2018-06-06 18:08:10 A1: I grew up in NY so I think @Yankees and the city itself. In our home of Indy, I think Lucas Oil, Eli Lily, @salesforce and @IMS. Indy has gotten more tech focused recently.

2601 2018-06-06 18:07:55 Their oil money 
2602 2018-06-06 18:07:46 What? That was the verbal equivalent of oil and water, or matter and anti-matter, or north and south magnetic poles, using both compression and encryption. got carried away there for a sec, but you get my point. Both of those things in that sentence can't be true.
2603 2018-06-06 18:07:38 I'm getting the harness for the trailer put on the Mazda today, the guy just came to me to tell me, "It will take 2 and a half hours," I hope that's  with the oil change.
2604 2018-06-06 18:07:36 Jack it up drop the oil out of it let them drive down the road and see how far they get
2605 2018-06-06 18:07:34 So I haven’t dabbed in a month and today I found a dab left over from the oil I thought I finished and wow, I’m lit.

2610 2018-06-06 18:06:36 changing oil/a tire and then mayb not skill but doing their own laundry
2611 2018-06-06 18:06:20 RT PaulPage: Biggest carload gain for U.S. railroads in May was the 13.7% yoy increase in 'crushed stone, sand and gravel.' Biggest part of that is the frac sand for the booming Permian Basin shale oil production.
2612 2018-06-06 18:06:18 Fucking lost it at "snake oil salesman" 
2613 2018-06-06 18:06:13 The oil looks strange,  too clean for a diesel and too dirty for a petrol.
2614 2018-06-06 18:06:11 Yet my MLA @AJWVictoriaBC continues his fiction-based campaign claiming these gains don’t exist, oil sands are evil etc etc. If we can reduce carbon emissions, surely something can be done about a gasbag like Weaver?

2653 2018-06-06 18:02:17 W/ tomato sauce or olive oil and garlic or...?! 
2654 2018-06-06 18:02:14 V easy to make. Look for good plans online that specify “Angles” by ‘cut 2x4 this long and nail underneath ‘ - order bags online - Paint with oil based paint. Med finish. Lightly sand finish if bags slide too easy.
2655 2018-06-06 18:02:14 okay, we don’t know Priyanka but she’s beautiful and I guess she makes Nick happy. and let’s be honest, also a cactus would be better than olive oil.

2658 2018-06-06 18:01:32 It’s probably a good thing that coconut oil doesn’t taste as good as it smells by itself
2659 2018-06-06 18:01:29 Just maybe barely - cannelini beans with sage, tuna, minced red onion/garlic, olive oil, red wine vinegar. Parsley if you have it.
2660 2018-06-06 18:01:26 Fried in the same oil as chicken..
2661 2018-06-06 18:01:10 And now, finally, we will turn the tables, yet don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
2662 2018-06-06 18:01:09 Hey if you’re having break outs, you deserve tea tree oil. It works like a miracle.
2663 2018-06-06 18:01:08 ねます…
2664 2018-06-06 18:01:02 I always put to much argan oil on my hair 
2665 2018-06-06 18:01:02 Just Anglo Canada though. Liberate Quebec and make it independent to really rub it in. It doesn't have any oil anyways.
2666 2018-06-06 18:01:00 Iranians suffered when British blockaded Persian Gulf after Mossadegh nationalized oil. Is it the victim's fault when a bully attacks the victim's friends too?

I think your problem is assuming too much good faith on behalf of the west when they deserve none, especially not USA
2667 2018-06-06 18:00:55 Getting my oil changed I have 15 minutes AMA. Just kidding gfy
2668 2018-06-06 18:00:47 My thoughts exactly... Vegetable oil might be too flax  and light for that.
2669 2018-06-06 18:00:42 As part of our litigation support, we represented EDO STATE CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS in its suit against EDO STATE OIL & GAS PRODUCING AREA DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION. The Commission was dragged to court for failing to provide details of some police station buildings and projects
2670 2018-06-06 18:00:35 No dairy, I don't wash my face only use water and coconut oil. My acne has been 100x better
2671 2018-06-06 18:00:33 The Trump team is asking for more of a foreign commodity to be imported into the United States.  In this case, it is oil from OPEC, probably trying to forestall the political consequences of higher gas prices during a midterm election year.

2673 2018-06-06 17:59:33 British SF space show Red Dwarf had the crewmembers using the toilet (one of them even getting an oil portrait of them done on it) in 1988. Slightly different tone of show though.
2674 2018-06-06 17:59:32 Feeling a lot better today So I did the oil change on the Subi.
2675 2018-06-06 17:59:23 My dad is so sweet, he bought me some oil and screen wash for my car  bless his little soul. 
2676 2018-06-06 17:59:13 I’m sure it will. It’s honestly been so effective for me. We should call it by it’s proper name or some will think we’re druggies  I got someone following me after I first posted that had a website delivery other stuff... deffo no CBN oil on it.
2677 2018-06-06 17:58:55 Stop trying to get more oil to burn, please #LeaveItInTheGround for our sake and our children's sake.
#StopKM
2678 2018-06-06 17:58:52 Oohhh...and the lavender oil.
2679 2018-06-06 17:58:45 The same peeps transporting oil in trucks to Msa? The same peeps who rob us through @KenyaPower or @nhifkenya or Kenya Pipeline or NYS? Really complaining...
2680 2018-06-06 17:58:45 Just add griundnut oil in the water to boil then put you spaghetti you are good to go
2681 2018-06-06 17:58:31 Maybe she needs her oil changed
2682 2018-06-06 17:58:24 A HINT, BEFORE oil was discovered things were hard! After OIL was discovered should things STILL be hard/level of burden to the tax payer remain the same? What concessions does this find brings to the common man afterall SOMEONE is making somewhere using this National Treasure
2683 2018-06-06 17:58:22 But they just said today..." good luck believing what this general says. Totally IGNORANT of oil industry, he was appointed by Maduro as a 'reward' for his role in social repression last year. He just repeats what Maduro tells him, their income comes from "other sources", not oil
2684 2018-06-06 17:58:21 ok so baby oil really does help remove fake tan and it makes it apply soooo much smoother

2686 2018-06-06 17:58:13 if you see me today & think my hair is oily... it definitely is bc @red_regan decided to squirt baby oil in my hair & mouth last night & it failed to come out when I washed my hair so YAY I LOVE REGAN

2688 2018-06-06 17:57:56 @AndrewScheer And if the truth be known, all kowtowing to US and other foreign pressure! How long would it take to build pipelines if the US needed our oil? 
NOT VERY LONG! Disgusted!
2689 2018-06-06 17:57:52 $40 oil change  lawd
2690 2018-06-06 17:57:27 Unless they got oil lmao
2691 2018-06-06 17:57:27 Simple, really. To prepare for an economy without oil, embezzle as much money as you can, buy houses in London, Dubai and Johannesburg, then run over there when the oil-less economic chaos starts.
2692 2018-06-06 17:57:12 Rub your Knife with vegetable oil at intervals of cutting,it stops the water content spill
2693 2018-06-06 17:57:04 Recently kagina launched plans to build fly-overs & where is the money going to come from - oil, that's not yet produced produced
2694 2018-06-06 17:57:03 CNBC, "four on the floor Lebeau", says airlines down today with cruise lines yesterday due to oil......................................odd thing, oil is down 10% in last month......
2695 2018-06-06 17:57:01 Just realized I am out of olive oil and all I wanted to do was sauté :/
2696 2018-06-06 17:56:53 That district is extremely loyal to Maxine. Though she has done nothing to enhance that district, she- a snake oil salesman, has ingratiated herself to them by pretending she cares & the poorly educated & misinformed in that community, believe her. It’s a tragic dynamic.
2697 2018-06-06 17:56:48 Screw the oil - Go for the Bacon !
2698 2018-06-06 17:56:38 @piersmorgan shame on you because you refused to discuss what your bloody greedy country is doing to Biafrans in Nigeria because of oil
2699 2018-06-06 17:56:30 Take the oil, poutine and Tim Horton's. Leave Bieber, Michael Moore and Celine Dion.
2700 2018-06-06 17:56:29 lead them from Temptation, make them royalty.
all the things we facing, make us question it.
 lead us to salvation, pour that oil please... thats how we become Kings & Queen 
2701 2018-06-06 17:56:27 CBD oil is literally the worst tasting thing ever, how do people take this every day 
2702 2018-06-06 17:56:13 Palm oil though, not sure of the efficacy of vegetable oil.
2703 2018-06-06 17:56:09 simple punya cleansing oil okay ke?
2704 2018-06-06 17:56:00 #WILT - #Texas alone produces more oil per day than any other #OPEC country save #SaudiArabia and #Iraq, YET, agriculture and industry are bigger.
2705 2018-06-06 17:55:55 It already is... I can’t afford to pay 80/Lt to travel 55Kms daily... Oil would be at 55/lt if it was under GST. @dpradhanbjp
2706 2018-06-06 17:55:55 *bomb the oil, then take the oil
2707 2018-06-06 17:55:52 Yang penting oil oilan. Pernah liat videonya di youtube, ada yg pake cleansing oil, baby oil juga ngaruh buat komedo
2708 2018-06-06 17:55:41 Tea tree oil, it's quite strong if you put too much.
2709 2018-06-06 17:55:40 #CL Oil set to bounce me's think, almost off $9.00 from its highs. So much for that bull market.
2710 2018-06-06 17:55:26 I typed the formula in wrong and wondered what palm oil had to do with anything
2711 2018-06-06 17:55:15 I love sauteeing them in olive oil with minced garlic. Just until they start to soften. You can also cut up a couple pieces of bacon, fry until fat is rendered then remove from pan. Cook green beans in the bacon fat until softened then mix the bacon back in to serve. Then season!
2712 2018-06-06 17:55:15 Will do.  The Pina Colada Thins became less appetizing when I brought some to work and my boss’s review was, “Not sure if I like them or if I’m eating suntan oil.” 
2713 2018-06-06 17:55:10 ..raise production by 500k -1M..."PDVSA is now headed by military, an IGNORANT of oil industry. Put there by Maduro to upease the army, their profit comes from "other sources", including fuels smuggling out of Vzla. ZERO intentions or chances to solve anything
2714 2018-06-06 17:55:06 Exactly, he didn’t even serve in the military he had his daddy help him get 5 deferments and blamed it on bone spurs while he was chasing women. #DonTheCon is a snake oil salesman.
2715 2018-06-06 17:54:54 Another counterintuitive fact is some oils can also have an SPF or be anti-bacterial (bye acne). 

Ex. Neem oil smells not great, but it can reduce redness/irritation and is anti-bacterial. (I use a salve variation for a spot treatment)
2716 2018-06-06 17:54:49 Kartoffelsalat . I need a trip to Austria. Aarrrgghhh, I’m missing Kern oil 
2717 2018-06-06 17:54:46 Canada was a British colony. So yea technically they did.

2723 2018-06-06 17:53:55 What are you talking about??? We have always been a major producer of oil. We just hoard it. Then sell it to other countries. We are still doing that. We are not using our own oil which is why gas prices are high.
2724 2018-06-06 17:53:43 Invade Canada. Take the oil.
2725 2018-06-06 17:53:42 Relax. Melania's in the shop for a standard Disney audio- animatronic update. And an oil change too.
2726 2018-06-06 17:53:40 The Oil's been moving for a couple of years now by the time we declare commercial production of the same, they shall declare it to unviable for export. Tutabaki na madeni hatujaona bado.
Anyways, Tano Tena,ey? :-D
2727 2018-06-06 17:53:40 #BestforBaby check the ingredients list to see if the products is alcohol free, fragrance free, very low on mineral oil percentage,natural & organic ingredients etc. 
Always do patch test on baby's skin like on arms or legs, wait for 24 hours to see if baby has a reaction.
2728 2018-06-06 17:53:39 Hi from San Diego ~ Do you have info on how whether this was LNG (probably) or oil, and how much?  Thank you for all your very important determinations!
2729 2018-06-06 17:53:38 That oil a mf lol
2730 2018-06-06 17:53:35 Funny that, that have they new efficient planes but do we see any savings? No, they just get more profit. Now the price of oil, which has gone up and down, but the price of fares only goes up...
2731 2018-06-06 17:53:34 There will BE no economy if catastrophic climate change happens because your government insisted on burning the 173 billion barrels of oil in the tarsands. Buying a pipeline in 2018 is like investing in Blockbuster video after the launch of Netflix.
2732 2018-06-06 17:53:32 In industrial factories, fossil fuels like oil, gas, coal etc. are used. The environment is contaminated for fossil fuel use. The environment is contaminated due to toxic gases
2733 2018-06-06 17:53:24 Women I understand that everyone don't have pretty feet I get it. But lotion though? Baby oil, sumpthing, Anything. If you gone be exposing'em
2734 2018-06-06 17:53:19 After the I heard the under car audio and shared with a Certified BMW tech he agreed with me. Most likely spun a rod bearing or some other bottom end failure. Next the bearing will fail and the rod will shoot out the block spilling all the oil.
2735 2018-06-06 17:53:15 Bro of the oil 
2736 2018-06-06 17:53:13 Coming for that maple syrup and oil sands.
2737 2018-06-06 17:53:10 Hahahahaha..Awesome!
2738 2018-06-06 17:53:08 Warm water and soap, do a hot compress on any bad areas, another wash to clean up any excess oil/etc. I used to get it real bad. Doong this morning and before bed helped. Also changing pillow cases 3-5 times a week worked wonders (as sweat/oil gets on there when you sleep)
2739 2018-06-06 17:53:08 Mustrud oil suit her
2740 2018-06-06 17:53:07 In my opinion,wouldn’t increase exports crude oil till the price reaches
$ otherwise forget it’s no good
2741 2018-06-06 17:53:00 What has been good is good ! All the populist and pro poor schemes Modi has rolled and is rolling out is because of savings from oil prices, increased tax base thru demo and GST and better delivery through Aadhar. If public accepts Modi in 2019 w/o UCC,370 etc consider it success
2742 2018-06-06 17:52:48 Tati! I have a video request! You’ve sort of done this but..could you show us your current fave beauty tools and possibly some cheaper alternatives? If you feel there are some that are ok. I am really thinking about picking something up to use with my night oil :)
2743 2018-06-06 17:52:24 Oh!
2744 2018-06-06 17:52:17 "Alrighty..."

"Better?"
2745 2018-06-06 17:51:57 Good time to pare down gov workers. Plenty of opportunities out there.
2746 2018-06-06 17:51:50 Learnt some interesting stuff today about oil and gas. Things about crude oil, projections of the use of this minerals by countries,why petrol is cheaper in our neighouring countries and the whole lifecycle of hydrocarbons
2747 2018-06-06 17:51:41 The acne meds I’m getting are gonna dry out my skin and lips from getting rid of the oil and all I can think about is Lexi saying I have soft lips at a party and I CANT LOSE THAT SHIT MAN.
2748 2018-06-06 17:51:40 With #PPP ruling Sindh longer than any dictatorship, I’m sure they could have built reservoir, desalination plants to ensure free flow of potable water in our taps. I’m sure those who’ve been voting the socialist party should be able to answer this better, don’t you think?
2749 2018-06-06 17:51:38 At the moment. Unless the oil a rabbit out of the hat before disaster huts they will be accountable too.
2750 2018-06-06 17:51:33 YAY CONGRATS

2755 2018-06-06 17:50:50 Ha ha yes, a gentle jab. Plus she uses politician's logic: sending less plastic to the landfill, which is 350km inland at Cache Creek, somehow ends up with less plastic in the ocean. Huh? It's like increasing oil sands production somehow allows us meet GHG reduction targets.
2756 2018-06-06 17:50:39 gue ga ngefek banyak sih. pake yg rice bran bekas jerawat yg menghitam pudar sedikit, pemakaian udh 2 bulan. terus ini nyoba yg sunflower oil, muka malah gatel padahal baru 2 kali pake
2757 2018-06-06 17:50:33 We need to be schooled about what now appears like  false expectations. Most Kenyans thought  that  just like other oil producing countries, pump prices will plummet.
2758 2018-06-06 17:50:18 Putin wants NK oil & gas.
2759 2018-06-06 17:50:15 Bah I threw it in my cart and after I pay for a break tag and oil change I’ll see if I have enough left over. 

Uuuuuggggghhhhh why is car stuff so expensive.
2760 2018-06-06 17:50:06 Eg:how do you explain Kenya already starting producing oil and Uganda up to today doesn't know how much in the ground yet we discovered the oil before them.
2761 2018-06-06 17:49:47 if i got into oil painting i prolly wouldnt leave my room for days

2765 2018-06-06 17:49:27 Sharks don't own anything nor are they territorial they are eating machines and if you happen to be near you might be food.  The ocean is our territory including it's predators, sharks cannot clean up oil spills.

2769 2018-06-06 17:48:59 The market will dictate when aircraft start being produced powered by alternative fuel, at the moment oil is sufficiently cheap making it unnecessary. No amount of green lobbying or scaremongering about carbon dioxide and global warming will change it!

2772 2018-06-06 17:48:51 Yes and it’s good. It’s soft matte, so if you’re not an oily person, it’ll work for you. My t-zone area carries most of my oil, so I tend to just stick with the Becca Evermatte.
2773 2018-06-06 17:48:45 Oh awesome! good luck and enjoy it  you will do fantastic....  cod liver oil is a good idea.
2774 2018-06-06 17:48:41 does this work for engine oil as well, the container of my old oil wasnt sealed right and now there are oil stains all over the place.

2781 2018-06-06 17:47:32 The Oil wells they got is a war booty and until they drill to the last drop they ain't leaving. Which has left up to 20-25% of the land and environment devastated beyond measure.
2782 2018-06-06 17:47:27 Tamale mirundi last morning said that Uganda is inevitably going to suffer from the oil curse.I can object in agreement with what he said
2783 2018-06-06 17:47:07 So I bought a tub of butter to use to make beef stroganoff one time and have been subsequently using it to make steaks.

Yday I learned that it is instead 40% vegetable oil spread 
2784 2018-06-06 17:47:05 you can only export surpluses in order to contribute sense in your economy. how much of that oil have we used locally?
2785 2018-06-06 17:46:59 And speaking of 'snake oil salesmen' and 'great masters' of all descriptions Mr.Gurdjieff  wrote down what he knew through effort, accident and the generosity of 'remarkable men', but he never claimed to *be* anyone but himself.

2788 2018-06-06 17:46:38 When I worked in the oil industry in Aberdeen the 90’s & we often used to use Schipol, Frankfurt, or Paris CDG rather than LHR which was always a nightmare. Long haul flights were often cheaper from there than the UK too.
2789 2018-06-06 17:46:33 put all my tanning oil on, walk to the pool, and this bitch is closed...... i’m pissed

2794 2018-06-06 17:45:30 psst. Did you know you can make more money investing in eggs rather than oil?
2795 2018-06-06 17:45:04 Care about what? The Saudis are investing more in renewables than Canada is. They know that the market for oil could collapse in the near future and leave them with stranded assets. They aren't stupid.

He flashes a warm smile, lips back to brush against the younger's nape in a loving touch before simply continue with his touches, hands smearing the oil a bit further.
2797 2018-06-06 17:44:56 It's not properly deregulated right? Govt decides price reliance gets. Is that right? If it's need to be properly deregulated govt should sell its majority stake in oil companies
2798 2018-06-06 17:44:41 My first marathon is at the start of October. I can't wait. You're doing amazing. I'm sure you'll smash it. I've started taking cod liver oil every day so they help my joints with all the road running I'll be doing
2799 2018-06-06 17:44:31 Have you got your linseed oil out?

2801 2018-06-06 17:44:25 Oil equities holding up this well after a bearish weekly report suggests the market is looking for a reason for the stocks to bounce. It should get one over the next couple of weeks with a lot (maybe all) of bad news baked in. #OOTT

2805 2018-06-06 17:43:58 That has to be a "dis" against Belichick and the pats right ? showing how The snake oil salesman's training methods are paying off ? I am sure @FelgerAndMazz are spinning it that way as we speak
2806 2018-06-06 17:43:55 Directly benefits the oil companies that have the   in their pockets. A surprise to nobody, the swamp is wide open, deeper  than ever and full of filthy mosquitos like Pruitt.

2809 2018-06-06 17:43:46 Question.....  would coconut oil work? 

*theres always one*

2811 2018-06-06 17:43:41 Last country you wana be compared to right now. Oil is LITERALLY the only thing Venezuela has. That place is now dirt poor!
2812 2018-06-06 17:43:33 Francine, please do me the courtesy of reading my tweets. 
If I have to use a bridge to get to work and it is very dangerous (like my use of oil), would you call me a hypocrite for telling people it is dangerous? I doubt it. Oil is like that bridge. It is dangerous for the planet
2813 2018-06-06 17:43:30 I’m gonna work on getting products to control oil cuz I really don’t need anything else
2814 2018-06-06 17:43:25 I've chimmed this before. Oil people don't care what country they scum up and ruin; even if it's their own. Zero National Loyalties.
2815 2018-06-06 17:43:12 You must have been in oil country, the rest of the state is a wonderful place! I live here and I had my back surgery here
2816 2018-06-06 17:43:05 Ive got it i just keep forgetting lol, ill definitely try the coconut oil tho
2817 2018-06-06 17:42:54 Are the Saudis purposely increasing exports to US to further depress the already depressed WTI and midland prices? If they are then that Brent diff gonna blow out even more! #OOTT #OPEC #Oil #Shale #Permian

2820 2018-06-06 17:42:34 Stupid me forgot to ask my mechanic to do an oil change.
2821 2018-06-06 17:42:17 An unreal combo that I eat everyday: two over easy eggs cooked in olive oil, 1 sourdough English muffin toasted with a laughing cow low fat cheese spread on top. Put the eggs separately on the muffin and boom
2822 2018-06-06 17:41:39 Petrol in Transit(PIT) robberies are on the cards. This is what the petrol price is heading us to. The ANC must wake up. We can't be told the increase is due to price of oil. It is due to greed and ego to amass as much loot as possible
2823 2018-06-06 17:41:37 I’d like it if there also was a tire and oil change competition.
2824 2018-06-06 17:41:11 I bought my dad some @RickRoss beard oil 
2825 2018-06-06 17:41:10 Toyota Camry is the best car if you’re looking for a sedan. They literallly run forever just like Nokia phones. I haven’t had to replace any parts on my car (besides tires and oil changes) until it reached 165k miles.
2826 2018-06-06 17:41:07 I need to learn how to change my own oil because it takes others way too long! I’ve been waiting an hour
2827 2018-06-06 17:41:04 In other words  peak oil
2828 2018-06-06 17:40:58 No water in tap or tank. Sweet water bowzers roam thru DHA massive rates 4 H20. Market or mafia, we knew they were gonna make it a commodity
2829 2018-06-06 17:40:57 140g plain flour, 200 ml milk, 4 eggs. Make sure your oil is REALLY hot before you pour the mixture in, and do not open the door until they are done (about 20mins)
2830 2018-06-06 17:40:44 Dear @KimKardashian , the California eco system is very fragile, and as one of the biggest producers of food in America, it is very precious. Please tell @realDonaldTrump NOT to drill for oil off our shores.  Thanks, and if you need more info before you meet with him, dm me.
2831 2018-06-06 17:40:34 Yes, they run tight oil from shale...

2833 2018-06-06 17:40:29 @NziokaWaita Am looking for you re oil and gas matters 
2834 2018-06-06 17:40:25 Renewable energy like geothermal, can meet the need for heating and so will electricity. Oil is a very inefficient way to heat a house. So it is not my head in the tarsands.  Energy demand is just justification for immoral actions. Even Saudi Arabia is investing in Renewables

2836 2018-06-06 17:40:11 Quevedo's knowledge of the industry is NIL. Put there by Maduro to please the military, their true income is from 'other sources' (not oil) and some from smuggling (out) products. No intention of solving anything. He merely repeats what Maduro tells him to say, why bother??
2837 2018-06-06 17:40:09 True shit.Ppl who rant about these things r the same one's who won't mind bribing 500rs to get their work done.Also it really isn't in Modi's power to control global oil prices anyway,so I don't get why ppl r so sensitive about this? Aur badhne chiye prices,pollution to kam hoga!
2838 2018-06-06 17:40:03 Even after going through the most profitable years in our history when the oil prices went up, but most of it was stolen and the country suffered for it.
2839 2018-06-06 17:40:00 In my analysis, the economic interest in oil (the oil never moves) is sold & repurchased using tripartite prepay contracts. Specifically in the Big Hill site. Outcome is (say) Saudi lends T-Bills & US lends oil.
2840 2018-06-06 17:39:56 Thank you Gadi for your efforts. This should have been a policy from the beginning! When my father got cancer from the oil fields burning in Dessert Storm he spent most of his time at Walter Reed Naval Hospital.  A great hospital but not all Vets are in close proximity!
2841 2018-06-06 17:39:53 my fanny pack be so empty  lip gloss, party pack, charger, a pen, money, & id, & my oil. dat be it.
2842 2018-06-06 17:39:50 Not in this dry ass state......I need a heavy heavy body moisturizer then I have to seal with an oil
2843 2018-06-06 17:39:36 RBI rate note- Expect another 150bps hike in next one year/two. Crude oil Price controls the Inflation. RBI has to dance as per Inflation & Crude price.
2844 2018-06-06 17:39:29 Oil money or politics money?
2845 2018-06-06 17:39:28 an 'easier' way to poach in water is to just spray some cling wrap with cooking spray/oil, put it in a cup, put the egg in that, then twist the top. put that in water until it looks done, then remove and unwrap. good on muffins w/salt and wilted spinach
2846 2018-06-06 17:39:24 Canola oil has <5% sat fat. Better yet just minimize your oil use altogether.   @EAllen0417
2847 2018-06-06 17:39:14 Un the meantime, ill try some coconut oil to moisturise. Nearly put aloe on!!! Luckily i asked google at the last minute ;-) had the poor plant cut and everything ;-) Time to get that Christmas inheritance! Seriously going broke over here!!! ;-)
2848 2018-06-06 17:39:13 Huge praise when Obama met with celebrities and rap artists, mostly over nothing. Was he a pandering Uncle Tom? Trump doesn't see color same way you do.
2849 2018-06-06 17:39:09 In Georgia my skincare routine was so simple.....organic body wash, cute like scrub, and coconut oil my shit was set
2850 2018-06-06 17:39:08 No oil change on the mustang
2851 2018-06-06 17:39:02 Don’t put that on Ellen, she’s a genuinely good person who helps as many as she can. She’s not an oil baron or owner of a diamond mine. Maybe those kids wanted the pic?
2852 2018-06-06 17:38:58 Oil
2853 2018-06-06 17:38:55 Biafra built refineries, manufactured rocket propelled weapons, spun yarn etc in war time. But Nigeria cannot refine their oil nor build weapons in peace time
2854 2018-06-06 17:38:35 No, snake oil costs money.

2856 2018-06-06 17:38:27 Olive oil, butter, garlic, parmesan, salt and pepper
2857 2018-06-06 17:38:25 For crude oil, hazardous substances, as well as passengers. Railroads and warning signals in need of repair/replacement. Check on China's new systems...
2858 2018-06-06 17:38:13 cheek fil ay has a flawed policy see...theyll never know im Gay when i storm in and drink all the boiling peanut oil theyll say "thats our best customer" little do they know
2859 2018-06-06 17:38:11 Very impressive an oil company monetizing the homeless issue and using it to make themselves more money. All while refusing them access to the restroom. Kudos.
2860 2018-06-06 17:37:56 Wait so your moisturizer with Aloe? I have been looking for different ways to moisturize without the added oil.
2861 2018-06-06 17:37:54 My brother think of this,d north really gain a lot from that war politically,militarily and economically they have oil wells in d south south more than any region,d best way to reset d lost glory is through restructuring,n they know it,fighting them is doing them a favor.
2862 2018-06-06 17:37:53 Don't put anything in my hair except some tea tree oil on my scalp after washing. dassetttttt. Could never be me having 5,000 different expensive ass products for my hair or my face
2863 2018-06-06 17:37:46 You won't be disappointed.  The two stage slow cook really works to keep the sauce from burning.  Make sure you really clean the grill and oil it well or it may stick.
2864 2018-06-06 17:37:39 It is necessary to the Joint Venture Partners to test the logistical and market needs for our crude oil. This is part of the extended well tests which will help us understand the characteristics of our reservoirs and prodcution rates of various wells.
2865 2018-06-06 17:37:22 Any comment on Obama's lies: Keep your doctor, smidgen of corruption in IRS, Benghazi video, shovel-ready projects, save $2500 a year on HC, no scandals, Keystone oil bypasses the US? There's more...

2871 2018-06-06 17:36:53 counterproductive. Oil and gas not going away anytime soon and I wound much rather have Canada provide than places like  Saudi and Iran where they don’t care.
2872 2018-06-06 17:36:49 tea tree oil>>>
2873 2018-06-06 17:36:45 And I love the smell of cloves/clove oil! But it’s not medicine, and I hope people know that going into it lol
2874 2018-06-06 17:36:36 Tools like those are great and way ahead of free+open ones, and their workers do deserve the money - yet, I don't see the connexion with why research has to pay for them, specially with oil companies in the mix... Sorry, I don't mean to dispute, but I just don't see the link
2875 2018-06-06 17:35:55 Heh

2881 2018-06-06 17:35:11 If Rockerfeller changes the ingredients of oil and changes it to something other than what it is ...you’d wanna care and pay attention 
2882 2018-06-06 17:35:05 Lol my car takes those expensive oil, went there and payed about $60
2883 2018-06-06 17:34:56 It will not be bad to get hold of this thing o!  I have a younger one for internship exam for one oil company, the invite he showed me has dragnet on it
2884 2018-06-06 17:34:56 Got my first car home from the garage only for it be leaking oil immediately. Sigh.
2885 2018-06-06 17:34:52 Great post. Long oil and the New Orleans Saints.
2886 2018-06-06 17:34:41 We’ve definitely noticed the quality of produce on Hvar. The olive oil is ... actually everything is! 
2887 2018-06-06 17:34:40 Especially the Italian kind with the oil 
2888 2018-06-06 17:34:40 Dude you throw some garlic and olive oil some extra seasons  ugh eat just by itself
2889 2018-06-06 17:34:32 We discontinue products for several reasons, including sales, availability, space in the warehouse, etc. We do carry the refill products individually, including colors, Quick Mix, and essential oil.

2893 2018-06-06 17:34:04 I miss cigarettes & alcohol on IndyCars. I get it, but damn they made great looking liveries!

Wish more motor oil brands & fast food companies would get back on board. I get they have budgets and no need to market, but dang. I do like all the tech based sponsors now though.
2894 2018-06-06 17:33:34 So why do you continue to use oil? Can you see why hypocritical...
2895 2018-06-06 17:33:33 When cooking, use the right amount of water, too little and it cooks too quickly. Use a little olive oil if making tortellini etc so it stretches properly.
2896 2018-06-06 17:33:29 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
2897 2018-06-06 17:33:14 OIL companies like IOC/HPCL gave 200cr.. Are Gujarat state companies?

2910 2018-06-06 17:31:46 God. Who cares about Satoshi's vision. Bitcoin is an asset. It has an use. It's like oil. Do we have to care about Rockefeller's vision when we fill up our car? Or is that stupid?
2911 2018-06-06 17:31:43 Hey there @JoseefSchachter, you missed the entire rally this year and the 100%+ gains in many oily stocks. Your call on oil has been brutal this year. Why would anyone subscribe to the the BS you pump out? Oh, that call for $50 by May, what happened to that brutal call?

2917 2018-06-06 17:30:52 NOTHING to do with Obozo. The Saudi's increase oil production to slow down oil development in the US. ALL oil production gains were done on private land - that Obozo had nothing to do with. Matter of fact he reduced the availability of government land for oil exploration.

It’s a rare bunch of traders who can say they made a killing on oil’s surprising rebound over the past year. The reason: there’s not many of them left.

The moral is, if you don't first understand the underlying cause of a problem, you're never going to find the correct solution. 5/5

2930 2018-06-06 17:28:58 Then maybe you should reference exactly what is being talked about. Comparing the price of produce is disingenuous. A meal is not 100% produce. Saying all food is pumped with sugar and oil is just not true. You must compare meal for meal.
2931 2018-06-06 17:28:45 Thanks - love the fact you have a site devoted to olive oil - now added to my feedly list!

2937 2018-06-06 17:28:19 .@NitaLowey’s amendment on the Interior appropriations bill is necessary to prevent @Interior from moving forward with destructive oil and gas drilling in the #ArcticRefuge. RT to urge @USRepRodney to support this important amendment. #ProtectTheArctic
2938 2018-06-06 17:27:59 It depends what type of tan you’ve used but you should be fine to use a body moisturiser or dry oil after the tan has developed as per instructions. This is normally after showering if you’ve left the tan overnight or 24hrs? Otherwise the tan will streak.
2939 2018-06-06 17:27:56 Iswear now if someone is making you an offer, the person must strip naked and bath in oil. Just in case they have a wire or camera.
2940 2018-06-06 17:27:54 If you do a review update us on the foundation with the oil too!
2941 2018-06-06 17:27:47 The Central Govt if possible should bring oil products under GST. This may reduce oil prices by 20%. But central govt should not sacrifice their revenue otherwise Defence & development work will delay.@PMOIndia @narendramodi @AmitShah @dpradhanbjp
2942 2018-06-06 17:27:42 They took one look, saw the oil had turned to mayonnaise and diagnosed a blown head gasket (or possibly cracked head or block). She needed the car, so agreed to have the work done, even though she couldn't really afford it. 2/
2943 2018-06-06 17:27:33 Trump’s knowledge of American history is like oil and water, they don’t mix. And former president James Madison would like to correct Trump about the war of 1812.
2944 2018-06-06 17:27:23 For that I shall have to take your word for it. Personally I am a balsamic vinegar & olive oil boy. But if Mr Heinz floats your boat go for it.
2945 2018-06-06 17:27:07 I’m also excited to try this peppermint + jojoba oil mixture on my scalp.
2946 2018-06-06 17:27:05 if bio oil doesn’t even out my skin tone i’m gonna cry

He lived for  Insurance, and well from it – then he started the Oil  Tanker hijackings,  and he did that as much from boredom – showing-off  and the money-lust,  as much as anything, but that is what he did to me –  in the end,
2948 2018-06-06 17:26:55 yesterday it was...gas prices are going up due to Trump and blahh blahh blahh...now you want to make gas prices go up...I'm not a senator but here is an idea..."DONT SHIP IT THROUGH TOWN"...wouldn't it be cheaper to build a bypass? besides crude oil isn't explosive chucky...#WTF?

2953 2018-06-06 17:26:35 is "snake oil" an animal spirit?
2954 2018-06-06 17:26:18 I’ve been screaming this since Jan 20,2017. Is there a reason why Democrats couldn’t hold daily press conferences outlining every action taken by this admin along with the consequences?Like sky rocketing health ins premiums and oil prices-ppl should know why & blame accordingly

2956 2018-06-06 17:26:03 If only there were another way to ship crude oil other than by rail.  Perhaps some type of circular "pipe".  If only your buddy Obama and the environuts hadn't blocked it.
2957 2018-06-06 17:25:58 Because they left not enough money to buy oil
2958 2018-06-06 17:25:56 I'm spending all week at #ASMS2018 telling people the Smithsonian studies a lot more than fine art. But what are my two posters about this year? Oil paintings
2959 2018-06-06 17:25:50 I wish I was the oil lady

2967 2018-06-06 17:24:38 Arthritis Symptoms May Improve with a Fish Oil Supplement. 
An analysis of data from 68 published studies found that a low-dose supplement of fish oil could lead to a reduction in pain and improved cardiovascular health among patients with osteoarthritis. 
Rheumatology, May 2018
2968 2018-06-06 17:24:29 Moooreeee Regulation = Higher costs passed on to the consumer. All after oil prices set to decline due to US production.  Another example of how the Dems want to keep you en$laved. Enough $ to survive but not enough so you are not dependent on them.
2969 2018-06-06 17:24:28 RBI hikes repo rates, crude oil is already been budgeting out. How much money does the non corrupted government needs from the developing middle class nation. Perks of having Rahul Gandhi in opposition. @PMOIndia @republic #IncomeTax @RahulGandhi

2972 2018-06-06 17:24:16 They have done the worse!!
Just when we are still complaining about fuel/oil scarcity, some wicked people have secretly reduced the oil inside Titus Sardine....
I'm suspecting NNPC.
2973 2018-06-06 17:24:14 Good, now let's cut off their flow of American dollars by opening up more Oil and natural gas drilling offshore and in Alaska. #MAGA #RedWaveRising2018 #TrumpTrain #Trump2020
2974 2018-06-06 17:24:05 All the offer is mindless agreement with the Snake Oil Salesman in Chief. It's truly disturbing. I mean, Christ, at least one upon a time the Right could claim "moral superiority", now it's just hate.
2975 2018-06-06 17:24:03 learning about oil cleansing blends changed my lifeeeee
2976 2018-06-06 17:23:57 The oil privatization deal, Trump being elected, and a Nuclear middle east was all a strategic plan.
2977 2018-06-06 17:23:47 This isn't good -not at all we're gonna be China's resource colony-industrial ag's gonna be using more chemicals/coal will be stripped from mountaintops-fracking for oil/gas is poisoning billions of gallons of water-injection wells are rendering people's drinking water deadly
2978 2018-06-06 17:23:47 I want an oil pen 
2979 2018-06-06 17:23:39 I have a cheap Wahl brand beard trimmer. I use the largest guard only, but if I want it shorter I’ll work my way down to the smallest. I also use trimming scissors and a comb. I occasionally put oil in my beard to prevent split ends and stuff but I’ve been out for a while lol
2980 2018-06-06 17:23:28 "I voted Trump"
2981 2018-06-06 17:23:27 Oil change 
2982 2018-06-06 17:23:25 I was worried that it wouldn’t fit my face too! I think you’d look great though.  So far my hair has been growing pretty fast and I’ve been using coconut oil, Black castor oil, shea butter products, and taking biotin lol.
2983 2018-06-06 17:23:05 United make all their money from football, they never needed an oil money or Russian oligarchs.
2984 2018-06-06 17:22:53 Cleaning my house with Murphy's Oil Soap I love the smell put the Cleaning is making me tired.
2985 2018-06-06 17:22:39 This grab driver damn sweet! He asked if I’m okay and I was like nope I’ve got the urge to puke. He gave me a plastic bag, some medicated oil and some orange sweet thingy. Kind souls still do exist 
2986 2018-06-06 17:22:24 Where do they get their oil from?
2987 2018-06-06 17:21:54 Yeah don’t you hate how that Obama oil policy gave us low gas prices.
2988 2018-06-06 17:21:52 in terms of more personal works, it's usually a bigger deal so people save up knowing it's like a luxury. Though how they do for like big deal paintings i'll never know, even as a trained oil painter lol. Commission artists tend to charge cheaper rates it seems as well.
2989 2018-06-06 17:21:38 Fry an egg in a little sesame oil to put over the top the noodles. Both cook about the same speed <3
2990 2018-06-06 17:21:37 Not since I’ve been using head and shoulders in my beard and beard oil
2991 2018-06-06 17:21:34 It's foreshadowing of the future headline when you and the rest of the @CJEdmonton badasses become PM and cabinet and divest the country from #fossilfuels, end subsidies, and cancel all pipelines.
"Breaking: Oil and state separate"
2992 2018-06-06 17:21:28 After it's cooked, I put a healthy layer of avocado oil in a pan and get it ripping hot. Avocado oil has a high smoke point so the skin gets super crispy and is delicious.
2993 2018-06-06 17:21:24 They have to maintain what national strength they have - it's no joke defending on all sides and trying to expand in a stone solid oligarchy with only oil and uranium as resources and ice locked ports.

2999 2018-06-06 17:20:47 néed to gone head and get this oil change
3000 2018-06-06 17:20:47 Most is from state increases on the fuel tax. We don't get oil from Iran. The rise is due to the Saudi's cutting production and speculators on oil. Nothing from Mexico. It could be worse we could have the Obama oil policy.
3001 2018-06-06 17:20:37 Hmm ... In the south asian cuisine we wud add onions; salt; cayenne, cumin & corinader powder to the slices cooked in olive oil for thick gravy (depending on water quantity), few coriander leaves 5 mins before cooking finish & that taste more delicious. Never liked rosemary! :/
3002 2018-06-06 17:20:36 honestly i’m just here for the bread & oil
3003 2018-06-06 17:20:22 Getting a oil change. Might kill myself if I gotta keep doing this shit every couple of months.

3009 2018-06-06 17:19:28 We did that. They have changed the formula of skin so soft so that it no longer contains citronella. I was covered in it from head to toe and it did nothing. Deet and things to burn like citronella candles etc work well. Lavender oil too.

3021 2018-06-06 17:17:49 Just a normal millennial, I wake up in the morning and check my giant vat of coconut oil to see if it’s solid or liquid so I know if I should bring a sweater with me just like everyone else
3022 2018-06-06 17:17:43 I buy a lot from there now. They have an amazing tea tree oil overnight mask and it has done wonders for my skin. I hardly shop at Sephora anymore (except for eyebrow stuff)

3025 2018-06-06 17:17:00 Never bleached but olive oil leaves it soft and shiny.
3026 2018-06-06 17:16:17 I used coconut oil before and that toned down my redness of my excema scars x
3027 2018-06-06 17:16:11 It's easy to tell you're lying. A parent would have had to fight for several months if not several years and had to see several different doctors and go explicitly out of their way to obtain cannabis oil to treat their child's autism. No children have simply been given cannabis.
3028 2018-06-06 17:16:09 "stabilize crude oil before it is shipped through New York, which will decrease the chances of explosions." Does he have a clue about crude oil??? Apparently not
3029 2018-06-06 17:16:06 Same thing happens with agave plants now that that damn agave oil is 'in' 
3030 2018-06-06 17:16:02 just spilt rose oil all over my fuckin counter lmao bout to be Real goddamn peaceful in here
3031 2018-06-06 17:15:54 Nice to see that it helped sending those diagrams & the support at Syvecs helped out quickly. Good luck with the rest of the wiring & that the oil burning isn't anything major like the oil pressure being too high into one of the turbo seals once it heats up.
3032 2018-06-06 17:15:52 you've gotta par boil it. You don't need to add vegetable oil just salt. It'll make it worse when soggy.

3036 2018-06-06 17:15:26 You can even saute many veggies in olive oil and it still healthier than not eating veggies at all! Asparagus, brussel sprouts, or green beans are all good candidates. I could go on for days because I love veggies!!!

3043 2018-06-06 17:14:25 The battle at US$60/b should start soon and once below this price, we should see oil stocks fall sharply. If so, we should start to add more ideas to our Action Alert BUY list.

3046 2018-06-06 17:14:11 Nah mate. I don’t mean that weird cheap light oil still a e.v.o.o  just a delicate one from ripe olives. Like south of France oil. Not spicy/bitter.

" You need Oil " holy shit I almost had a heart attack 

Thank God it was just a stiff window 
3048 2018-06-06 17:13:59 Soooo the Oil companies are producing that H2. Out of what and why should they continue if they no longer need it?
3049 2018-06-06 17:13:58 There are reports out that China has  built up its commercial and strategic storage by over 120Mb so far this year. If so, this shows where the oil glut is building. If China slows its buying that would add to pressure on oil prices.

3053 2018-06-06 17:13:27 Biggest carload gain for U.S. railroads in May was the 13.7% yoy increase in 'crushed stone, sand and gravel.' Biggest part of that is the frac sand for the booming Permian Basin shale oil production.

3055 2018-06-06 17:13:22 Yeah exactly but remember even oil companies are govt. Owned entities so perhaps model like that can be introduced for charging pumps as well but for that again surplus power is needed again only cud be possible with govt help

3059 2018-06-06 17:13:01 The key is seasoning and flavor. Tossing broccoli with olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic or even adding some italian blend shredded cheese. Maybe make a fruit bowl and mix with a dab of honey which is a natural sweetener.
3060 2018-06-06 17:13:01 Its not recyclable, there are types of plastic bags that can be land filled and when in the ground will degrade over a month, corn starch based, hemp oil based etc. I have three dogs so that's a lot of poo bags, I buy biodegradable bags and they are cheaper than fancy ones.
3061 2018-06-06 17:12:50 If Russia raises production from eastern Siberia fields to China by 500Kb/d as they are planning, then a glut of oil will hit the market and crude prices will fall much farther.

3072 2018-06-06 17:11:38 but that extra light oil is probably quite heavily processed thus low in polyphenols so you mightaswell use the dirty stuff. I'm not a food neurotic especially but ppl who say can make mayo with evo, coconut oil () and avocado oil are clean eating mental

3107 2018-06-06 17:07:42 With a few exceptions, oil for example. WTI Spot is a beast. Got REKT so many times trying to tame it. 

Another beast would be $GBPJPY or "the dragon".
3108 2018-06-06 17:07:26 Right to try ..... means every quack snake oil peddler can now take advantage of sick, desperate people .... it is a horrible plan
3109 2018-06-06 17:07:18 2. Improve Food security; the @UN @WFP and @UNHCR_Kenya should observe and consider refugees in kakuma as human race. Kakuma should not be a dumping side of an annual herbaceous legume from the genus Vigna, Cornmeal and oil. The UN agencies should at least improve on the diet....

3138 2018-06-06 17:03:58 If one finger brings oil, it soil the others!! Think!
3139 2018-06-06 17:03:56 Maybe, but it will go BK because of it.  This situation is analogous to drilling an oil well; production spikes initially and then declines precipitously.  All you have to do is look at S/X sales and their downward trend to see where this is headed.
3140 2018-06-06 17:03:53 From your new oil pen? Does that mean it's hitting really good now?
3141 2018-06-06 17:03:52 Coconut oil!
3142 2018-06-06 17:03:48 I had to pester my parents to get me a DF bat. The condition was I had to knock it in properly and oil it regularly.

Chuffed to bits when I bought it from Sugg Sports.
3143 2018-06-06 17:03:26 Yeah because now that I think of it, my doctor only recommended kegals after my delivery to help strengthen the muscle, so I think it was the coconut oil

3148 2018-06-06 17:02:45 To which my question would be, does the government set up fuel pumps or do the oil companies? Perhaps it needs some synergies between manf & power companies which would need little government intervention

3159 2018-06-06 17:01:43 Just say yes to olive oil and coconut oil. Ghee, which is a type of clarified butter, is also allowed.
3160 2018-06-06 17:01:38 Yes, Andrew Wilson himself said that oil had been ‘baked into’ the White Paper of 2013, meaning that Eck had lied about oil being ‘just a bonus’ - as we knew very well.
3161 2018-06-06 17:01:36 What a terrible shame:
A rapid reduction in demand for fossil fuels could see global economic losses of $1-4 trillion by 2035 according to a new report.

 Oh do fuck right off.

Move to renewables then assholes.

3185 2018-06-06 16:58:53 Seem to be worse the last few years as more people are reacting badly & getting infected bites. I fall back on my aromatherapy training & always carry Yarrow & Helichrysum essential oil gel to slap on me (or the horses)asap after bites & stop the reaction before it takes hold .
3186 2018-06-06 16:58:40 Stop carbon taxes & illegal activism to protect our economy & relieve the already over-burdened taxpayers of Canada. Demand for oil/oil products continues to rise despite the desperate lies from the left wingnuts. #CdnPoli

3191 2018-06-06 16:58:18 yeah i remember you telling me about the coconut oil i think that probably helped more because it probably helped you stretch more like the skin down there
3192 2018-06-06 16:57:49 Unless it's expensive.

3216 2018-06-06 16:55:49 Doing kegals actually helped me! And I also would put coconut oil because i heard that that helps too. So I don’t know if it was the kegals or the coconut oil that helped, but I recommend trying both just to be safe

3227 2018-06-06 16:54:04 Trudeau has chased not only billions of oil investments away but pretty much any investment into Canada. He has got us on the USA terror watch list. Please name one good thing trudeau has done?

3238 2018-06-06 16:53:14 It does sort of take the breath away, I wonder what our reaction would be if instead of destroying Indonesia the palm oil trade chose Skye?

3246 2018-06-06 16:52:09 It’s a rare bunch of traders who can say they made a killing on oil’s surprising rebound over the past year. Why? There’s not many of them left. Since March 2012 the # of funds globally which trade in oil has dropped from 368 to 130, according to data group eVestment.

3249 2018-06-06 16:52:01 Do you not know what metaphor is? I am saying that our USING Oil is like USING slaves. It is an immoral choice. Because our using oil instead of renewables, kills the planet. That makes Canada an immoral nation if we choose to burn the oil in the tarsands. I can't make it clearer

3255 2018-06-06 16:50:54 Nah, I don’t like to bother the doctor. A few drops of Olbas Oil in some hot water usually does the trick.

3259 2018-06-06 16:50:39 Read the Skunkwerks book last summer. The plane would leak oil when parked because it wasn't sealed fully because hen the plane was in flight it was so hot that the metal would expand. 
3260 2018-06-06 16:50:38 He confirms if the plug is well placed and working, checks the oil gauge, then tries harder, only for the recoil start to be shattered. He finally gives up and hope the power holders provide what he's paid outrageous bill for. This is Nigeria!

3266 2018-06-06 16:50:03 I had a bad experience with flax oil several years ago. Tasted a drop and immediately my throat started itching both inside and outside. Have stayed away from flax since. But I did find a recipe for egg replacer through google
3267 2018-06-06 16:49:51 some would argue wars were fought for access to oil, to further western capitalist interests

3270 2018-06-06 16:49:23 You think little Jonny ran over and hit the Volcano button? No. It was natural.

And then there’s America, who dumps oil into the oceans on purpose, which in turn costs us more money to clean up, inevitably putting ourself in debt with stupid choices.

3276 2018-06-06 16:48:57 Let me get this straight, you find more offensive to bleach an artificial flower than send our citizens to risk their lives in pointless wars to kill people in another countries just to the USA can mantain its status quo and oil complex?
3277 2018-06-06 16:48:55 That sounds dreamy  this was at an off shore oil company too and the bits had just come back from Norway and was just SO COOL. I loved it. Excited to see what this new place holds!
3278 2018-06-06 16:48:50 if, like me, you have  sensitive skin that's prone to random breakouts:  Wash your face as normal and then apply 'zinc and castor oil' ointment . 

I do it at night since it leaves a white layer but it works miracles. My blemishes are lighter and the pimples dry out overnight.

3281 2018-06-06 16:48:31 Great article, Canada is stronger when together on issues...National Energy  using Canadian resources instead of foreign oil would be an important step.
3282 2018-06-06 16:48:26 By whom out of what and why should they continue once we no longer need oil?

3289 2018-06-06 16:47:38 I am not saying oil and slavery are the same. I am looking the morality of our ACTIONS. Oil and climate change are a moral issue. Our use of oil is killing the planet. Canada is sitting on a mountain of oil (tarsands). We have a choice. To use it and kill the planet or not use it
3290 2018-06-06 16:47:29 it’s just the oil from the giardiniera  peppers lol.

3293 2018-06-06 16:47:11 Earlier one of my colleague was asking around for painkillers coz she had stomach ache but no one had any.

3298 2018-06-06 16:46:26 I listened to the #andersoganderspodcast with #SørenRasted and I agree with Mr Rasted. I am on methotraxate and folimate. I would rather be treated with cbd oil if my doctor prescribed it. In a  beat. Read the list of side effects for the former, @Fedeabe @AndersBreinholt
3299 2018-06-06 16:46:15 60+% of the H2 produced is used to clean up oil
3300 2018-06-06 16:46:14 The government isn't holding technology back. Compassionate Use is in place. And you know what? We ought to be cracking down on snake oil shops operating solely to fleece people. "Stem cell clinics" that haven't tested a damn thing, staffed by people who have no medical degree.
3301 2018-06-06 16:46:09 I got smacked (hard) on the head with a bible. Several times over several years. Was prayed for, prayed over, told to release 'the demon', dunked in holy water,  signed with holy oil. 
However, an actual exorcist said an exorcism wasn't necessary. Ya think?!

3310 2018-06-06 16:44:48 So how expensive does petrol have to get before forecourts get blockaded again?

What's the point of raping other country's oil reserves if we're still paying over £1.30 a litre?!

3312 2018-06-06 16:44:32 I DO NOT wear lotion in the summertime. Coconut oil was my best friend last summer. This summer I discovered almond oil.
3313 2018-06-06 16:44:17 That's how I do it with the coconut oil maybe I will toss some butter in it. I have this smoothie blender I can put a lid on to drink out of
3314 2018-06-06 16:44:14 Slice. Toss with shallot, olive oil, rice wine vinegar, basil, salt, and pepper.
3315 2018-06-06 16:44:00 The country music playing in this oil change waiting room has just an absolutely absurb amount of twang
3316 2018-06-06 16:43:56 $4.549 a gallon at Fabian in Jay.
That's for the hi test with no corn oil in it. Use it for the chainsaw and other small motors.
That's $1.5 more per gallon than the regular corn added gas.
I feel they are tagging use a bit harder than should be.
3317 2018-06-06 16:43:26 Gavin Newsom of California is selling snake oil just like 'Obama the snake' sold to America. CA and America deserves better than Democrats.

3325 2018-06-06 16:41:59 essentially you take your normal coffee (brewed however you want) , toss some butter, that MCT oil, and your coffee all in a blender (any), blend on high for 30 seconds, and you get a super frothy coffee. Tasted pretty good to me haha.

3349 2018-06-06 16:39:40 The reality of selling snake oil for the mind.
3350 2018-06-06 16:39:33 Yep its a great way to travel and across the globe modern countries are extending their rail while we seem to be running it down or using for oil transport only. #sad
3351 2018-06-06 16:39:28 They should stop bombing brown people for oil.

3353 2018-06-06 16:39:18 Being an adult is so hard like I have medical bills??? And I need to get an oil change for my car? Also why does my hip keep popping and when will my son come home from the war and when will my husband stop cheating on me with that bitch Janice from accounting??
3354 2018-06-06 16:39:11 They drove out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed

3356 2018-06-06 16:39:02 A pipeline from Lamu to Lokichar will be constructed to coincide with the the full development of the oil fields but before the completion of the  pipeline, oil consignments will be transported by trucks #OilYetu

3361 2018-06-06 16:38:32 OPEC is an impotent cartel. If they had any power, how did oil fall to $25???
The govt should stay out of the global free market
3362 2018-06-06 16:38:20 Fun fact about me: when I lived at my grandparent’s ranch we had a blizzard which knocked out electricity for 3 days. Had to use oil lamps, not use running water so the pipes wouldn’t freeze, light the stove with matches, etc. Was a good experience but not my favorite one ever

3377 2018-06-06 16:36:56 Inflation in Venezuela has shot up from 20% to 4,000%.  
*_The worst part of the irony is, Venezuela has the highest global oil reserves !_
*The main reason for the crisis is - 'most corrupt and poor Governance' under the  guise of socialism ! Black money is the order of the day
3378 2018-06-06 16:36:54 The issue is not really oil (although PetroCaribe did buy some support until now) it is that Venezuela is run by a tin-pot dictator who keeps himself in power by subverting democracy; trampling on rights of people and; destroying the economy of a once prosperous country.
3379 2018-06-06 16:36:53 I like the way you think...baby oil or jello?

3390 2018-06-06 16:35:54 Venezuela benefitted from the huge rise in oil prices we've seen since 1999. Today prices are more than double the price levels in the 90's, but 2 million Venezuelans have fled, and over 80% live in absolute poverty - it's another failed Marxist experiment

3411 2018-06-06 16:34:31 I don't think that's what they say. They are using oleic acid as a measure of diet quality and infer that in some areas in means olive oil and in others meat and you have to know from which most comes to assign the quality mark, as it were.

3464 2018-06-06 16:28:10 What caused the dependence on foreign oil? I believe in the U.S. prior to the 1970s more of it was domestically produced.  Also there used to be a lot more oil companies which kept the prices low due to competition.  Seems like monopolies are the problem.
3465 2018-06-06 16:28:08 This is why data brokerage is a 250 billion USD/year industry and personal data the oil of the 21st century.

3478 2018-06-06 16:26:54 Just tossing this out idk if you have done it but try coconut oil instead of butter
3479 2018-06-06 16:26:53 I laugh in clear skin everytime somebody say don’t put coconut oil on your face! 
3480 2018-06-06 16:26:52 I buy fractionated coconut oil so it’s a little different. It’s light, clear, and scent-free so it’s easily absorbed by the skin without clogging pores. It’s always in a liquid state opposed to virgin coconut oil which is the solid state that you’re probably thinking of.
3481 2018-06-06 16:26:44 Hope that your twitter account has the ability to change price of crude oil or make the naira equal to the USD. Dude made a legitimate point and instead of countering it or supporting it, you not only digressed, but spewed thrash. I'm yet to understand how you all reason.

3487 2018-06-06 16:25:37 @SenJoniErnst @ChuckGrassley why does Shady Pruitt need a sound proof phone booth in his office? Is he using it to strike deals with Big Oil? That snake needs to go before farms like my family’s are gone due to the bad farm economy and trade wars. @realDonaldTrump
3488 2018-06-06 16:25:30 told carlos i was watching YouTube videos to learn how to change my oil, so I don’t always rely on him to change it. he went and made me a video of him changing his oil and tbh it was cute as heck
3489 2018-06-06 16:25:28 This pub is playing early 90s dinner party music: k.d. lang ‘Constant craving’; Terence Trent Darby ‘Sign your name’, Gipsy Kings ‘Bamboleo’. I feel the need to dip bread in oil and paint the walls cinnabar.

3507 2018-06-06 16:23:27 Not worth sorting that barnacle infested junk.  Burn it for boiler feed on the trawler that recovers it.  That saves new oil to make plastics from, if you must.  recycled plastic is full of junk and has no value.  New plastic is cheap already

Jun.5 (Dow Jones) -- Having drained one glut, OPEC and its allies have found a new, brimming oil hoard to worry about: China’s crude reserves.

3617 2018-06-06 16:11:28 Yeah, it's great to see a shift away from it. Being honest, I've only become aware of and more engaged on the issues around palm oil in the lsst year or so.
3618 2018-06-06 16:11:07 However, on a daily basis (when I don't use aloe vera) I use a non-natural toner and mosturizer which are water based that way it doesn't contain a lot of oil and helps to balance the skin oil.

3643 2018-06-06 16:08:27 It's very hard not to feel frustrated, disheartened and cynical about the future with the negative direction Canada is taking in GHG reduction and plastic waste reduction with this clueless Liberal government that supports Oil Sands expansion and inaction on plastic reduction.

3692 2018-06-06 16:03:30 It's pretty easy to remember oil changes when there's a sticker on the windshield to remind you, but don't forget about your filters! Dirty filters can increase your fuel usage by as much as 10%.

3701 2018-06-06 16:02:42 Why would the goverment forcibly transport imported goods on  SGR to Nairobi BUT then transport their oil by road to Mombasa. Hizo lorry ni za nani. They new Ann Ngirita in town loading........

3703 2018-06-06 16:02:36 that it makes. However, refineries also, unavoidably, produce some lower-value products (such as fuel oil) in the process. To increase their margins, many refineries have invested in conversion units to increase their ability to run cheaper, low-quality crudes and/or to increase

3710 2018-06-06 16:01:51 My understanding is that doesn't happen much because the Kratom trees take so long to grow so they just plant them in any empty space now and have stopped in many areas allowing the palm oil industry to do that type of damage.
3711 2018-06-06 16:01:50 de mckinsey: "The profitability of a refinery comes from the difference in value between the crude oil that it processes and the petroleum products that it produces.

3773 2018-06-06 15:55:40 Happy birthday, Alex! As a gift to you, mention this post to get $5 off your Oil Change! Code: HappyBDay
3774 2018-06-06 15:55:30 And how many oil and gas businesses would close up if Canada stopped gifting them $3.3B a year in subsidies?
3775 2018-06-06 15:55:24 I tried frying cheese samoosas today.. I managed to get the purr part out from the oil now I just need to figure out how to take the cheese out.. any ideas?
3776 2018-06-06 15:55:21 i’m not one to get heated over canadian poli but justin trudeau can suck a dick after this whole pipeline buyout. 

our costal trees & waters are more important than dirty oil money.
3777 2018-06-06 15:55:17 Not to worry. Can’t leave it to windy wet night, might not get the birds. Cover yourself in cooking oil

3780 2018-06-06 15:54:58 @KenyaGovernors Turkana oil should be 50% to the county those people have been neglected for so long by the national government am sure 90% of those who attended the ceremony saw the president and Dp for  the first time #OilYetu

3783 2018-06-06 15:54:42 Only North Carolina shores! Nothing but oil rigs for as far as the eye can see!
3784 2018-06-06 15:54:38 Damn, I slowly start to realize how widely used these oils are. Rapeseed oil is used in almost every restaurant here. No way to avoid it if I eat outside.

3788 2018-06-06 15:54:23 @RBC 1/2: improvement in trade data over recent months adds to the evidence that Canadian economic growth picked up in Q2 after a sharp pullback in home resales alongside transitory disruptions to oil production and transportation backlogs combined to weigh on Q1.#canada #CAD
3789 2018-06-06 15:54:20 Apple cider vinegar for sure. I used it on the worst sun burn I’ve ever had(which was horrible I was burned for a million year lol)& it helped relieve so much pain. My mom burns easily too & she uses lavender & peppermint oil to help- I’ve never tried it but she swears by it.

3810 2018-06-06 15:52:09 Think how it would be if you did not get a tax break  gas is going up wether you like it or not . North Dakota oil production has gone down less  oil higher prices summer higher demand. Want cheap gas. Let north Dakota go back into full production. Start drilling in Alaska .
3811 2018-06-06 15:52:06 As for those middle eastern cartels, that is exactly what Alberta is trying to break. Which makes you wonder, all those that argue against Alberta oil, who are you supporting? Iranian Mullahs? With their horrendous treatment of women?
3812 2018-06-06 15:52:03 It's not immoral if God says it's ok. If God put the oil in the ground you can tear down the forest to get it. But where would you decide the morality of that. It's all personal. Erik Prince is a Catholic and runs a PMC, might think that would be a pickle.
3813 2018-06-06 15:52:01 Good points but why does Africa need aid when Africa is arguably the wealthiest continent in terms of natural resources etc.?  In fact, 60% of the global distribution of arable uncultivated land is in Africa, yet Africa imports food.  Goodness Nigeria imports oil!
3814 2018-06-06 15:52:00 Oil companies like @BP_America see oil demand decreasing now and in the future and therefore we need to invest in other energy sectors like #biogas and renewable natural gas #RNG, says @HarrisonClay_CE @Energy_Vision NYC workshop
3815 2018-06-06 15:51:52 Just had the best grilled cheese sandwich. Spread the bread with Duke’s mayo (which we can get in some places in the Rocky Mountain region!) and cooked it in coconut oil. A good mix of American & Muenster. Soothed my poor body.

3830 2018-06-06 15:50:29 The increase in fuel taxes only happens once a year on the first of April. The month on month fuel price increases are influenced by international oil prices and exchange rate and these are not directly within government’s control.

3842 2018-06-06 15:49:17 • Mainly condition the ends
• Dry Shampoo (IG: @xselfcarebb)
• Don’t wash your hair everyday
• Balance your brushing as overbrushing can stimulate oil production
• Witch Hazel - Closes up pores so less oil is released
• Tea Tree Oil - Controls sebum production

3844 2018-06-06 15:49:05 I don’t think anyone forgets about The Debt, they’ve been warning for years. We can’t afford cuts to any services that cause people to lose jobs and rack up their own personal debt though. Sometimes you need to put money in places other than oil to get things going.
3845 2018-06-06 15:49:01 North Dakota's oil boomtowns are facing an uncertain future — here's what it's like to live there Dah! Let Trump build another Oil pipeline from Canada thru the U.S. and see if it gets any better!! Moronic!

3856 2018-06-06 15:47:08 Indeed Big OIl Trump is implementing policies based on the notion that climate change does not exist ramping up emissions at breakneck speed - we will pay a heavy price for this insanity - time is running out fast and may already be too late

See also: pre seasoned meat/infused oils/pre cut sealed vegetables/any oil based salad dressing/sodium broth/bottled lemon or lime juice.

4049 2018-06-06 15:30:28 I currently add rosemary oil to my shampoo....this would be great!!!
4050 2018-06-06 15:30:27 Our pre-owned taxis are refurbished before we sell them. The following items are replaced before the pre-owned taxi is sold: All oil and oil filters; air filters; fuel filters, spark plugs, V belts; and wiper blades (front and back) are replaced with new
4051 2018-06-06 15:30:20 Also if you want to know how likely it would have been for a Japanese victory, next to none. The us oil embargo was crippling and a ticking time bomb.
4052 2018-06-06 15:30:18 My new beard oil smells great
4053 2018-06-06 15:30:15 #MwashumbeNaShugaboy Black is oil
4054 2018-06-06 15:30:11 Good luck with that
4055 2018-06-06 15:30:08 Gulf Oil started in 1901 with the discovery of oil at Spindletop near Beaumont, Texas. #WikiWednesday
4056 2018-06-06 15:29:59 They certainly look a hell of a lot more sustainable than deeply exploitative #SiliconValley #SurveillanceCapitalism models!

#PersonalData is NOT the new oil. 

If it's any liquid, it's #lifeblood - so extractive / exploitative business models & setups are quite simply vampiric.
4057 2018-06-06 15:29:57 That looks like lube or baby oil tho  still pretty tho

4059 2018-06-06 15:29:54 If you want to eliminate oil from touching your hands then you need to drop the phone or the computer and keep your lame uneducated comments to yourself! Maybe you'd like to try living off the land without all the modern amenities manufactured by oil? Give it a try..I dare you!
4060 2018-06-06 15:29:51 Every time I go get an oil change the mechanic makes me feel like my car, life, and everyone I love will burst into flames at any minute
4061 2018-06-06 15:29:50 Wonder if Texas will make medical marijuana legal? The more I research I see that Oil is very healing from cancer and even Arthritis pain! #cancersucks

4063 2018-06-06 15:29:32 Wow $23T to the global elites. Meanwhile investors are fleeing Canada thanks to your ludicrous policies. Time for Alberta to take its resources and join the US. That’s where all the oil goes anyway. Canada doesn’t appreciate AB but the US already does.
4064 2018-06-06 15:29:32 I’m at the dealership getting an oil change and then boom here I see somebody walking by with their dog 
4065 2018-06-06 15:29:12 @narendramodi understand rising oil prices are due to global crude price. But RBI hikes repo rates in times of good growth and low inflation
4066 2018-06-06 15:29:07 And how do you enforce these? A cop at every location 24/7? You get the Bloods and Crips and MS 13 to do these things first and we will talk.
4067 2018-06-06 15:28:48 I thought it smelt like tea tree oil

4073 2018-06-06 15:28:03 @waitrose Hey Waitrose. Do you have any plans on stocking any #CBD Oil products? CBD Creams/Salves? I currently purchase it online but would prefer to purchase from your shops. Thanks.
4074 2018-06-06 15:27:56 Google: "oil for immigration"
4075 2018-06-06 15:27:54 you have to oil it up and squeeze your body into the tube?
4076 2018-06-06 15:27:34 @JustinTrudeau I understand part of our economy is still dependent on oil but what happened to your #promises to our #firstnations people? Still being trafficked with no answers, no clean water, faced with extreme prejudice. I know you can't flick a switch, but maybe do something
4077 2018-06-06 15:27:30 It’s not anti American to point out the truth. The US likes to claim moral superiority in its actions around the world when the reality is that money talks. Oil talks. We are not necessarily the good guys. The right is all about flag waving. The left is about telling the truth.
4078 2018-06-06 15:27:17 Not only motorists, sir. Transport of food and other goods means the prices of EVERYTHING goes up and up and up. Because of oil reserves has been sold for next to nothing so people can loot the money

4083 2018-06-06 15:26:30 OK you fracking experts, I have a question: how many gallons in a barrel of WATER? Is it the same as oil, aka 42 US gallons?
4084 2018-06-06 15:26:13 2/2

We need to elect younger representatives.

People who will actually be alive in 20 years to deal with this mess.

People who aren’t trying to stoke religious sensitivities or start wars for oil.
4085 2018-06-06 15:26:12 Ouii, just cos he said the president knows about government officials engaged in the oil corruption?
4086 2018-06-06 15:26:12 And your sources are?  Oil companies and their fake scientists? Fox News? Oil companies have been exposed as spending millions on fake information.  They knew about climate change decades ago. And who exposed them? Journalists like those at @huffingtonpos13
4087 2018-06-06 15:26:10 1.) Tomatoes

4088 2018-06-06 15:25:26 if you draw the trend line closer to the previous bounces, it looks like we have already broken it to the downside from a daily and 4hr perspective.

4131 2018-06-06 15:19:46 Metallic Madness and Titanic Monarch have been my favorite stages to play through in Sonic Mania. They’re so creative, have bangers for music, and are difficult and even intimidating somewhat without being too annoying like Oil Ocean and Hydrocity.
4132 2018-06-06 15:19:40 I'd definitely look into using essential oils for something like that, instead of fragrance oils. My usual scent oil site doesn't carry all the ones I'd want but I know they're much easier to find than the scents I use for a lot of our other candles.
4133 2018-06-06 15:19:40 I mean if it were oil spewing and not ash, I’m sure we would assume the Justice League role real quick. And idk we are the wealthiest nation to ever exist on the face of the earth and we do share a continent w these people 
4134 2018-06-06 15:19:34 Lol get some beard oil and probably change your diet up. The only reason mine hasn’t gotten to it’s full potential is because I’m in the Army Reserves and I’m required to shave when I go there but best believe when I’m not there I grow it out
4135 2018-06-06 15:19:23 I get that bc I have cancer & use cbd oil & eat plant-based majority of the time so I understand the benefits but often that’s not enough AFTER you get cancer. but really all I’m saying is it’s false to say that chemo isn’t a cure & cbd/plant-based are bc every cancer is diff

4140 2018-06-06 15:18:52 What about our choices as a nation? Does Canada not have a responsibility to keep our oil in the ground if burning means the end of the planet? Are we a moral nation or simply a greedy one? Do we make money regardless of the consequences? Do you, Sir?
4141 2018-06-06 15:18:44 Not to mention the huge number of oil spills throughout the country

4143 2018-06-06 15:18:37 Norway has the highest GDP per person in the world due to massive oil reserves. That’s an extreme.

Iceland is about the population of a London borough. It’s another extreme.

4212 2018-06-06 15:12:47 The Port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands sees about 8,200 tankers each year and Singapore has about 22,200 tankers annually. When did you last hear of an oil spill in either of those places? Vancouver would be looking at about 430 tankers/yr.

4218 2018-06-06 15:12:14 Venezuela's economy was built on oil exports. The price of oil crashed and the economy went to shit. That's not a refutation of socialism. It's a warning not to base your economy on a single, volatile commodity.

4264 2018-06-06 15:07:39 There is little overlap between oil and solar panels (except mostly for the fact the panels are transported in diesel powered ships / trucks). Natural gas, OTOH, is usually the preferred pairing power plant for solar PV.

4326 2018-06-06 15:01:21 .@stevenfurtick's last sermon really impacted me. He preached about not comparing our "oil" to someone else's, and to continue pouring our "oil" into the world, into others, even if we don't get anything in return. Our "oil" = our gifts. 1/2
4327 2018-06-06 15:01:20 @morningmika If course, I suspected the reason up front and was very much on guard, meaning he got no money and finally dumped me! They are easy to know, usually widows (some with kids to make them more prone to receive sympathy), on an oil rig in the middle of no where,

4335 2018-06-06 15:00:47 Ah interesting, and sure!  I tried some of that oil you had mentioned, different scent.  I found it a tad too oily but worked well.
4336 2018-06-06 15:00:44 And you haven’t answered my question. Is Canada not responsible to the rest of the world for our actions? Do we get rich by selling the oil from the Tarsands regardless of the fact that it will kill the planet and our children? Please answer.
4337 2018-06-06 15:00:42 They blindfold you before throwing you into the deep fryer so the shock of the burning oil on your body is even more pronounced
4338 2018-06-06 15:00:26 hahhaah now that would make sense but apparently it's to do with knowing where to push and pull.  I was told oil is always a good thing for loosening up though.

GERS deniers don't agree. SNP Growth Commission confirms defecit. So today the SNP say it's not a bonus.

4465 2018-06-06 14:47:49 We're committed to using only the most sustainable sources of palm oil in our products. We have removed it wherever possible and 100% of the palm oil used in M&S products is RSPO certified.
4466 2018-06-06 14:47:31 The Liberals promised to end fossil fuel #subsidies.  Instead, their govt provides more support for oil & gas companies than any other #G7 nation and is least #transparent about fossil fuel subsidies @JustinTrudeau @cathmckenna

4470 2018-06-06 14:47:02 There's only so much oil in the ground, Katee.  Maybe if the federal government didn't pay better than the private sector, they wouldn't have a cash flow problem.  Maybe if they didn't spend $800 billion more than they took in last quarter, they wouldn't have a cash flow problem.

4482 2018-06-06 14:45:59 it's the ingredients of cheap food like palm oil ( 50% saturated fat) and sugar/ salt, chemical flavours, preservatives ( like sulphur, bad for gut  bacteria too) which upset balanced metabolism, set up lowered absorption, malnutrition and cravings.

4519 2018-06-06 14:42:26 WTI Crude is off $8.00 since President Trump tweeted about oil prices being too high. You seem curiously quiet about a 10% drop in 10 trading days. Does your opinion remain what you tweeted here?
4520 2018-06-06 14:42:24 Oil is down more than 10% and gas dropped 4 cents, just a little more than 1%. WTF?
4521 2018-06-06 14:42:22 The comparative study differ from one country to the other ..eg the resource's ,tax system, .hence our taste and preference eg .venezuela has access to oil but no basic commodities such as toothpaste etc..some balancing is required here!

4568 2018-06-06 14:36:29 I tweaked it a bit tho. Cos I don’t have bird fat. So I just used olive oil and some butter. And heated it with chopped garlic, dried rosemary and dried parsley.

4576 2018-06-06 14:35:52 Most squeaky wheels keep right on squeaking, for the one simple reason: they don’t squeak for a lack of oil; they squeak because it’s their nature to squeak. Squeaky wheels are never quite happy, and they make sure everybody knows it.

4579 2018-06-06 14:35:16 When prices rise for a time, quantity demanded softens (eventually) while quantity supplied rises (eventually).  The result is falling prices.  That's what we are observing now in global oil markets.  Economics is so cool!!!#aspredicted

4603 2018-06-06 14:32:39 Another huge build in US crude inventories when seasonal draws are expected...The US is producing too much light oil which US & global refineries can no longer take.  Expect Brent-WTI spread to continue blowing out, & US shale producers to underperform integrated majors.

Will US and Oil companies let this happen? 1/3

4664 2018-06-06 14:29:48 The cost of upgrading our refinery to refine the waxy crude oil far surpasses the benefits. Google 'towards a Petroleum Master Plan' and see the maths. Even a refinery for crude oil from Kenya and Uganda would still not make economic sense.

We want to see the fine print of the agreements that this regime has signed on OUR behalf before we can argue the merits and demerits of oil.

End of the day, oil should tangibly benefit local community and not impoverish them as has been the case with Mara and Maasais.

4679 2018-06-06 14:28:29 they are linked, and we are always indirectly affected by global fuel economics. e recent 'shortage' in e past 2 weeks was partly attributed to dynamics in global supplies after oil exporting countries decreased production resulting to e 1-3 cents increase.

4736 2018-06-06 14:23:37 Chavez wasn't the first to rely on oil. You don't have to be capitalist to diversify either. He could have diversified and put the money into social enterprises. That would be socialism. He was just too short sighted to do so and the country paid the price.
4737 2018-06-06 14:23:11 そうですそうです。お大事に！

4744 2018-06-06 14:22:48 #OilYetu A developing country like Kenya ought to take advantage of the oil in Turkana and use it to lower energy costs in the country. This will in turn lower production costs. Dimwitts want to sell oil to pocket returns. Kenyan politicians are dogs.

Soon, that large track of land of Mkubwa where SGR is to reach and Inland port to be constructed in Naivasha, will soon host the Turkana's oil refining industry.Just to deny Turkanans opportunities to develop. Selfishness! #OilYetu

4839 2018-06-06 14:14:07 I'm all for refining oil sands here instead of importing from mid east and Africa. Trans Mountain exports our wealth and our jobs. 90 full time jobs is all we get after pipeline is built. 1000's more long term jobs from just one refinery, and less taxpayer money spent.

4876 2018-06-06 14:10:33 Where does the federal Government get their money from? Have you ever pondered? All monies come from the natural resources of States, especially oil mineral of South South States. Nigeria has no land not resources. All resources belong to the States. Fed govt. has nothing. Thief.

4888 2018-06-06 14:09:43 Firstly, it was the @OAS_official - not the US - who decided to throw out Venezuela from the organization via vote. Secondly, our oil is already mortgaged to China and Cuba over the next 20 years. Thirdly - what do you propose then on behalf of the Venezuelan people?
4889 2018-06-06 14:09:38 Hay dos campos claves. En Amatitlan, Pemex tiene el apoyo financiero y tecnico de Lukoil y Renaissance Oil (conformado por los miembros de Mitchell Energy).

4890 2018-06-06 14:09:38 Trump wants oil prices to remain at a level that'd encourage the fracking industry to invest, and Saudis respect Trump's agendas, otherwise Saudi can boost it's production and kill the oil prices/revenues to pressure the Ayatollahs if Trump allows them to
4891 2018-06-06 14:09:31 We have plenty of salt tealight holders in stock, and just a couple of oil burner salt lamps left. They all come complete with a tealight. The prices of our Himalayan salt products are the best we've seen in the local area :)

4908 2018-06-06 14:07:48 We have laws that don’t make any sense, but can make dollars. Marijuana is illegal most places but people still smoke it. They will still smoke and harvest it even if it’s criminalized. Hemp is better than cotton. The oil is too. (Competition). It’s hilariously contradictory.

4916 2018-06-06 14:06:27 The IOCs who terrorize our environment act as if the life of an American or Briton is more valuable than the life of a Niger Deltan.

4931 2018-06-06 14:03:48 Tullow Oil has spent nearly $2 billion which is recoverable from proceeds of oil sales .It's too early to celebrate. So they will have to recover their money and from there, is when we can think of revenue sharing. #OilYetu

4941 2018-06-06 14:03:10 A lot of people use oil instead cause it’s easier to use! But maybe call ahead if you know who’s gonna be there and ask if they cook the food using butter v oil? But either way it is very inconvenient:(

4949 2018-06-06 14:02:13 To be fair, shatru is raising valid points. People are really frustrated with rising oil prices when it can be low based on international price. That drives all other prices and that is a big thing. Modi seems to care only for celebrities and publicity. Something is not right.

4952 2018-06-06 14:01:38 I am skeptical, because of the severe negative reaction. Nausia/ stomach discomfort but no coconut oil.

5032 2018-06-06 13:51:53 I am all for the changing of our energy source ( I now have grand children) but to build what we need will take boat loads of money.

5042 2018-06-06 13:50:49 since when is oil more important than the lives of military veterans? 

you claim to fight for veterans, yet all you do is boost your political stupidity while veterans suffer.

5043 2018-06-06 13:50:48 The lapis oil felt a bit heavy and it’s supposed to be for oily skin. I’m slightly skittish now when it comes to using oil as a moisturizer. 

The Pyunkang seems okay so far! Compared to the Biossance, which just melts into your skin, a little bit goes a long way. That’s a plus.

5145 2018-06-06 13:40:02 Great experience but not a fresco!  Oil painting on dry plaster.
5146 2018-06-06 13:39:51 K found it - she gets that by taking off the Feb 6 low - I will see how that works with Murrey etc - good blog though - that oil chart works with mine - thanks for finding it :)
5147 2018-06-06 13:39:40 No one needs Palm Oil with sooo many available alternatives
5148 2018-06-06 13:39:35 His Republican backers by preventing oil tankers from docking at refineries in the US is what caused the double digit inflation in the first place. I lived through it. Far from morning in America, Reagan's election and the Dems losing their wrkng man's orientation gave US Trump
5149 2018-06-06 13:39:33 I don't have figures with me.
But what we had seen and experienced is enough. 
-Long queue for water at midnight
-Oil lanterns for 8-10 hrs daily
-No roads (distance of 50 km use to take 3-5 hrs) 
BJP has changed MP and made it great place to live...

5153 2018-06-06 13:39:04 They detest 'oil' money so that isn't an option.
5154 2018-06-06 13:39:03 What you're seeing is actually a mixture of oil and crumbs that can sometimes form during packaging and it is not peanut based. Please DM us the UPC, expiration date with the letters & numbers that follow.
5155 2018-06-06 13:39:01 At #ThunderChrysler one service advisor tells me they'll need our 2017 #Jeep Renegade for the day to do an oil consumption test. The second one said just an hour. We shall find out @Jeep
5156 2018-06-06 13:39:01 Kung sino man sana nakapulot ng pera ko, ibili mo ng masarap na pagkain or ipang-hot oil mo, bec that was how I meant to spend the money hahaha
5157 2018-06-06 13:38:59 Ex bean-counter in oil industry and globalist tool. Ignore.
5158 2018-06-06 13:38:57 @slater_22s  way to go Slater!
5159 2018-06-06 13:38:55 He's owned by BIG OIL. or he would speak to the issue of #MarineCloudBrightening (aka commercial ship pollution) along our coastal areas, the aerosol application of chemical ice nucleating bacteria to artificially cool snow covered areas, & other climate engineering atrocities.
5160 2018-06-06 13:38:35 To which country are 'we exporting our oil' to? Any idea Dakitari?
5161 2018-06-06 13:38:31 Большинство нефтеперерабатывающих предприятий в Европе, на долю которых приходится около пятой части иранского экспорта сырой нефти, планируют прекратить закупки: RTRS. #Brent #Oil
5162 2018-06-06 13:38:16 The collusion with Russia is not only the election it is something that is ongoing. Trump never fully enforced sanctions after 98-2 vote from the Senate for them. Pulling out of the Iran Nuclear treaty raised oil prices to boost Russian economy. Trump works for Putin not America.
5163 2018-06-06 13:38:12 Embrace natural hair oil
5164 2018-06-06 13:38:12 All of my friends Eurokracy prep is like, get an oil change, finish engine bay, etc and mine is get eyelashes filled, make sure I do my laundry, maybe go tanning 
5165 2018-06-06 13:38:10 Hey without perpetual wars how would we ever maintain a permanent armaments industry? And without a permanent armaments industry how could we defend our oil interests? And if our oil interests fail the dollar fails and if the dollar fails how could we continue to fund more wars?
5166 2018-06-06 13:38:05 Republicans lost their whole party to a snake oil salesman in 2016.
5167 2018-06-06 13:38:02 #OilYetu Unless concerns  raised by locals are adequately addressed, is don't see Kenya being different from other conflict ridden oil producing countries.
5168 2018-06-06 13:37:54 oil painting is really something else

5170 2018-06-06 13:37:51 Where are you guys at?
5171 2018-06-06 13:37:48 I'm a total lotion nut, so I'm already doing that. This is brand new, so, I'll have to experiment and see what works. If what I already have isn't satisfactory, I'll try oil based next. Thanks 
5172 2018-06-06 13:37:43 But isn't that her real agenda anyway? Stopping the flow of oil?
5173 2018-06-06 13:37:38 *GROFR* Manno da empresa *GROFR*, dirigindo scania R, saiu  da empresa NS Oil em Aalborg, transportando Diesel 25t, para entregar na empresa EuroAcres em Berlin. A distância estimada de 673 Km  @ofrtransbr #etsfs
5174 2018-06-06 13:37:30 Hey @ProfTimNoakes @jaynebullen looking for pure c8 MCT oil that ships to SA for a client.. any recommendations? #c8mctoil
5175 2018-06-06 13:37:28 Absolutely. They are all grifters, padding their own pockets with tax payer money. They devastate entire states when they have power for an extended period of time. OK can’t even keep their school open 5 days a week due to the budget. But the oil & gas industry barely pay taxes.
5176 2018-06-06 13:37:25 ได้มากได้น้อยก็อีกเรื่อง
5177 2018-06-06 13:37:23 Museveni: You go to pray the whole night, shouting as if the Lord is deaf and some priests will put oil on you that it brings miracle wealth. Really Africa!
#SOTNUG18
5178 2018-06-06 13:37:22 The oil and gas industry in Norway was built with the help of international giants like Exxon and Shell, but the Norwegian Government held firm control of it. I think we can say for sure that this was a good deal for all participants. 
5179 2018-06-06 13:37:19 Did you know hybrids use gas too? Also breaks and tires get used. Along with oil and other parts that wear over time. I mean I can promise you paying your sister is cheaper then paying a cab. Have a great day !
5180 2018-06-06 13:37:01 One of Mr. President's big four is manufacturing,  yet we are exporting crude oil and importing it when processed. Your dreams are valid!! #OilYetu
5181 2018-06-06 13:37:01 @KagutaMuseveni: You pray the whole night as if God is deaf and cannot hear. You somehow hope to get miracle wealth. Some of the Priests bring oil which they think will make you rich. But really Africa!  #SOTNUG18 #EirakaRadioNews
5182 2018-06-06 13:36:53 I like my natural gas delivery system too....critical to getting oil to my house for export
5183 2018-06-06 13:36:51 Pump prices are 1-2p per litre more than they need be, despite escalating oil costs and a weaker pound. Greedy oil speculators are using geo-political spats between the USA and Iran to deliberately over inflate petrol prices. @FairFuelUK
5184 2018-06-06 13:36:46 @KagutaMuseveni : In Kalangala, because of palm
oil, people are now using solar energy. In Kiruhura,
there are no grass thatched houses, or people using
paraffin lamps... #SOTNUG18

5190 2018-06-06 13:36:13 I put my stress in my neck. So if I wake up to the dog barking or something, my neck can hurt. I use @NaturesUltra #CBD Oil. Works for me! #Healing I sleep on my side so I use a water pillow, which helps a lot. Back-sleepers are supposed to use a flat pillow. Feel better

5193 2018-06-06 13:36:02 lagi baca-baca soal double cleansing. trus galau karena udah pewe pakai krim dokter.

padahal merasa butuh pake cleansing oil gitu karena make up hari-hari.

tapi galau, takut jadi breakout.

5196 2018-06-06 13:35:39 Tea spoon of coconut oil before breakfast
5197 2018-06-06 13:35:36 I looked at what was in my hand and said, “It’s not enough”.

He replied, “Pour the oil. Drop the loaves. I’ll do the multiplying.”
5198 2018-06-06 13:35:29 I’m using a vitamin E oil right now, but it stains my clothes, so I wanted a lotion for the day and the oil for night!
5199 2018-06-06 13:35:24 お財布に優しいいっそ、あれにして欲しいですね、礼装強くするための効果ない礼装のやつに・・・・!!!
5200 2018-06-06 13:35:23 No thank you. Norway has been living off  an extraordinary large oil production for a very long time, also Norway is ethnically homogenuos country. Probably this is one of the reasons why Trump calls Bernie, crazy Bernie. Sorry about that Ha.
5201 2018-06-06 13:35:21 That pipeline has been in place since 1965 are you really daft enough to want to transport oil in trains after this? Your ok with standing on corpses are you?

5203 2018-06-06 13:35:19 Sir Ji instead of doing all this can you try to bring down #PetrolPriceHike ? Compare all other countries #Indians paying huge money for oil ! What’s your step to bring down the prices ? #IOC  sooner it will hit 100rs per litre for sure !

5205 2018-06-06 13:34:46 Rising oil prices help US exports as US is now pumping close to 11 million barrels of crude every day & increasing exports of energy products.
5206 2018-06-06 13:34:41 Chicken takes a little practice, but once you figure it out, it's amazing... I've found that seasoning it, and throwing it in a pan with olive oil and medium heat is the best way
5207 2018-06-06 13:34:39 Our oil is not a kikuyu hooker!
5208 2018-06-06 13:34:35 ยังดีที่ได้ตัง
5209 2018-06-06 13:34:14 Yes. I agree. Makes perfect sense.
5210 2018-06-06 13:34:14 Not even oil money, commodities in general!
5211 2018-06-06 13:34:14 Correct me if I'm wrong here, but wasn't the Treasury's position (at least initially) that countries/ companies should begin winding down oil imports from Iran now and not wait, so as to be in a position to ask for waivers once sanctions kick-in?
5212 2018-06-06 13:34:08 Tariffs had not started yet!  Oil and Gas exports are what we exported in much higher volumes and that is what has given us the difference...........................Word!
5213 2018-06-06 13:34:03 That oil money is good to plan with.

5221 2018-06-06 13:32:51 You must be terrified of the good Greens can do, since you seem to be a professional shitposter on them. You work in oil?

5223 2018-06-06 13:32:37 You might like to investigate the background of existing drug laws in the USA. They literally derive from a snake oil salesman who claimed he could cure opiate addiction in 3 days. An idiot believed him, and henceforth all drug laws essentially assumed this to be true.
5224 2018-06-06 13:32:25 The focus has shifted. Builds or draws will be meaningless with higher exports/us production. Higher exports/US production means more market share for the US which will result in builds for OPEC/North Sea/Russia
5225 2018-06-06 13:32:23 You go to pray the whole night, shouting as if the Lord is deaf and some priests will put oil on you that it brings miracle wealth. Really Africa!

President Museveni #SOTNUG18 @clifflyk
5226 2018-06-06 13:32:21 M7: When i meet some people in the countryside, they are always sitting idle, when i ask them what do you do, they say we are just there... then you see some priests distributing oil telling people it will make them rich, Oh Uganda #SOTNUG18
5227 2018-06-06 13:32:18 You can come to Putin how u want netanyahu. Big gut(economy), small gut(poorer nations), big mind(innovative around the non security areas), small mind(no innovation just trading goods maybe, providing a service like oil). It dont matter when u report to moscow

5231 2018-06-06 13:32:14 I thought he was forced out because he didn't agree to government's demand for more when oil prices was spiraling downwards.

5236 2018-06-06 13:31:55 Museveni says people are praying all night, shouting as if God is not hearing hoping for miracle wealth. Priest gives them oil to bring them wealth "Really, really Africa!" #SOTNUG18
5237 2018-06-06 13:31:49 Uwan 1st time pakai oil cleanser.

Massief eiken

Vrijdagavond nog even plinten zetten en onderhoudset afgeven.
5239 2018-06-06 13:31:36 They go to pray in the night, shout as if God is deaf, praying for a miracle of wealth. Even some priests bring oil and say, this oil will give you wealth. My people, since Jesus left they are just earning money, because they are earning coffee. @KagutaMuseveni #SOTNUG18
5240 2018-06-06 13:31:32 I still prefer true oil paints w/medium of linseed and damar/turp; the damar adds tack which preserves brushtrokes #artist #havepaintwilltravel
5241 2018-06-06 13:31:30 yes he is a big lair, Iraq wells are empty he needs Iran's oil to enrich him self and his buddy's, the art of war pretend to help the people with one hand and steal there wealth with the other

5244 2018-06-06 13:31:24 love Trump pretending to care about Republicans. A man who was going to run as a Democrat. He has no values, he just knows a good con when he sees one and who to sell the snake oil to.
5245 2018-06-06 13:31:07 Think this year I'll lose my jab jab virginity. My major concern is removing the ole oil.

5247 2018-06-06 13:30:59 This is heartwarming. What is confounding however is the export of raw soybean while the country still imports vegetable oil. General outlook shows we are on track.

5279 2018-06-06 13:28:23 We were plagued by multimillion dollar loans fr US to finance infra proj of Marcos. The problem was we're not exporting much to balance our ext trade so we exported people. Then the oil crisis came & then financial crisis after liberalization of forex.

Daylight robbery is never discreet.

Preachers prey on the weak. 
Ripping the spoils of the soil. 
To litter the water with oil.

We did discuss this earlier. But it will be short term. The second half of this year (which begins soon) should be bearish.

5338 2018-06-06 13:21:01 Credit creation. Of course your argument that falling oil prices tank an economy is blown up by the fact that US oil prices fell by 90% during the late 19th century - which didn’t cause a recession, but corresponded with unprecedented massive economic growth.

5431 2018-06-06 13:12:50 The Rand has depreciated from earlier highs of R11.50  to current levels of  R12.77 as a result of strengthening Dollar and US bond long yields. This is happening at the time when OPEC is raising oil prices and the depreciating local Rand is making it expensive to import oil

Almond milk has natural oil that doesn’t dry out the skin. So you can mix regular water and almond milk it keeps you natural oils locked in.

5566 2018-06-06 12:58:21 Why do we want to establish ourselves as a crude oil exporter?.We should think of refining the crude oil locally so that we can make use of the end products. #oilyetu

When it should've also had a highlighter pallet, and two jars of glow in the dark highlighter.

5607 2018-06-06 12:54:05 Paper money is an example of SoV which needs utility. Without it, the cash would be worthless. But we have commodities which are also SoV, some based in utility like Oil and others on agreement of value, like Gold, Silver & Gems.
Utility is not essential to be SoV.

5616 2018-06-06 12:53:01 That chart could lead to incorrect conclusions. Mostly because we measure oil demand in MBD and GDP in percent terms. Energy intensity falls due to rising services component but incremental demand growth hasnt slowed that much for EM (DM however isn't growing anymore)
5617 2018-06-06 12:52:53 Apocalypse is so 2017. We are now oil price up and wage growth slow. And everyone we work with is very young. It will be like this for a lonng time.

5809 2018-06-06 12:32:34 The only problem with moving to electric en-masse is that you swap dependency on Oil with dependency on Lithium, which IIRC there's less of, and is horrifically un-enviromentally friendly to extract. If they can solve the issue of batteries, we'll be sorted.

5825 2018-06-06 12:30:06 Gas prices are the highest in 3 years despite pumping more oil nationally than ever. Prices are 20% higher than last year. Since Trump repealed the increased fuel efficiency standards US demand will continue to cause the price to go up.

5848 2018-06-06 12:27:01 Donnie, have you tried CBD Oil at all?
5849 2018-06-06 12:26:57 Yeah, "cold fusion" would be a better choice, but at the moment petroleum is the most unlimited, and convenient fuel, who knows, it may still be regenerated. Moving away from Arab oil would be better for everyone. Refining in Canada, would be better for Canada

5870 2018-06-06 12:24:23 yes, it's time for a comeback, seeing that all oil stocks have suffered 
5871 2018-06-06 12:24:07 As with all oil and gas hiring booms, this will lead to mass layoffs in about 6 months. They aren't employees, they're survivors and future layoff victims.
5872 2018-06-06 12:24:02 Palm oil is a cheap product used by the food industry. All parties are scared of upsetting the food industry. We and the environmental impact don't matter until election time.

5922 2018-06-06 12:18:00 Here's a perfect example: FISH OIL.
Up to 80-90% of fish oil capsules for sale are poorly processed, sourced from unsustainable fishing practices, oxidized, toxic, and rancid with suboptimal EPA-DHA ratios.

Scientific evidence tells us that many of these oils are as effective as pharmaceuticals in easing pain and suffering, while faith tells us these connections to the natural world go back thousands of years, and that God intended them to be so.

6144 2018-06-06 11:51:39 #Venezuela has the world’s biggest #oil reserves and is a key supplier to #American fuel markets but its output has been hampered by inadequate investment, mismanagement and a confrontation with the United States that has led to sanctions.

6146 2018-06-06 11:51:11 Mr. Monaldi, I would really appreciate your opinion about the level of oil production in Venezuela at the end of 2018. I´d say they could easily fall below 1.2mb/d (and I think I am fairly conservative). Thanks!

6245 2018-06-06 11:33:46 I dont buy that.  Then why the December 20% cut announcement? Their intent has been to drive up the price for the IPO Road Show.  That thinking is right.

6274 2018-06-06 11:28:58 Yes, you want to force people to use an oil boiler to heat their water on a day like today rather than solar electricity from the roof of their new house ?!
6275 2018-06-06 11:28:55 Denying jobs and revenue for younger generation while giving to foreign countries does make you a traitor....unless you park your vehicle and start protesting pipeline from Seattle built over last few years or protest oil imported from other countries

6277 2018-06-06 11:28:36 @joerogan I was watching the episode of JRE with Candice Owens and got me thinking about the climate change debate and how little people are talking about all the jungle and peat lands that are being burned and how much CO2 is being released just from that just for Palm Oil.
6278 2018-06-06 11:28:26 The @AldiUK and @LidlUK versions of Nutella are much nicer and don’t use palm oil. Nicer and more environmentally sound. Win win!

6289 2018-06-06 11:27:04 In 2008 we paid around +-US$103.00 per barrel of crude oil, & a litre of petrol was around R10 -R11.00. Today a barrel is not even US$70.00 but we paying so much! Is this @GovernmentZA trying to replace stolen money at our expense or what? This can’t be allowed! #PetrolPriceHike

6293 2018-06-06 11:25:45 You'd have me believe Friends of Science, originally created by petroleum geologists and funded by oil industry $$, over the huge majority of peer-reviewed climate scientists the world over? Even oil companies believe climate change is caused by fossil fuels. #ExxonKnew

6300 2018-06-06 11:23:50 Norway as of now is the one with the most number of electric cars. And the fun thing it's one of the nation with large oil reserves. I once said I feel sorry for my platinum because very soon will not be of importance since catalytic converters will be phased out
6301 2018-06-06 11:23:50 lesson learned don’t sleep with ur wax pen because you’ll shatter the glass and oil will leak all over you :-)
6302 2018-06-06 11:23:47 Always use the right oil/viscosity for your car.

Don't spend money buying a 20k oil when all ur car needs is just a 5k oil. 

People don't always get this right and it could be bad fo4 your engine.

6311 2018-06-06 11:22:47 No you are wrong. The Brexit vote and the decrease in the Fireign traded value of the £ happens 2 years ago. The main oil price rise happen in May 2018.. How’s that for ignorance.. Still showing your level...! #gobrexit

Try focus on sorting your party out and stop clutching at non existent straws.
6314 2018-06-06 11:22:25 Should we not be careful as to how much oil we export for short term gain and Think strategically about conserving our resources for the future?

6332 2018-06-06 11:19:41 I'm no economist, but rate hike by RBI is a poor knee jerk reaction to increase in crude oil prices. It's not been that bad and beginning to come down. What's the issue then and where is the rationale? Mkt has already priced that but home loans will go up by a few, 4-5 EMIs
6333 2018-06-06 11:19:39 Trump is the one abusing power gives big oil companies BIG tax breaks and now the Americans are paying for it at the pump
6334 2018-06-06 11:19:38 Gas at the pumps hit four year high.

Trump has successfully made big oil richer and American workers poorer

6336 2018-06-06 11:19:36 the price of oil was around $ 100 for a long time and no one complained. The real problem is taxation that has exploded. I hope there will be no increase in production to satisfy American politics ...

6366 2018-06-06 11:15:24 Consider cost of sales tax, tariff,  shipping,  refining,  storage,  additives, environmental protection,  insurance, waste, and cost of oil per barrel:  how can gas only cost $2.85/gal? Gasoline isn't why we drill.  It's a volatile waste product.

6371 2018-06-06 11:15:00 Three reasons. 1) Less ghee/oil. Or
2) Flame was too high. Lowest flame the better for Mysore Pak. Or
3) The mix to be poured into plate as soon as heating is finished. Otherwise the mix releases oil and turns hard on cooling.

6387 2018-06-06 11:11:51 The government failed to diversify its economy when oil prices were high, they then plummeted which in part led to the sky high inflation. Add to this U.S meddling and it doesn't help. It was a massive error but nothing to do with socialism. What's bollocks about that?

6429 2018-06-06 11:06:38 That's overly basic.   Gasoline and Natural gas are not lubricants.  Oil is refined to get best & costly lubricants, not for gasoline.   By-products are waste products which can be sold near cost instead of put back under ground.
6430 2018-06-06 11:06:35 Higher benchmark soybean prices in Chicago and India’s plans to raise the import tax on soft oils pushed up Malaysian palm oil futures on Wednesday, a day after they hit their lowest in nearly a month.

RBI raised Repo rate by 0.25% now at 6.25%

Monetary policy committee is convinced that 
Inflations r going to increase due to higher prices of Oil(Petrol/diesels)
In coming quarter.

6560 2018-06-06 10:42:28 Would be interesting if the contents were also submerged in mineral oil, which has better heat dispersal properties than air. Definitely a good thing as it allows the water to cool the hardware while having minimal impact on the environment.

6562 2018-06-06 10:42:11 . Some fish oil e.g. cod liver oil is very high in vitamin D providing more than enough of the recommended intake in a single teaspoon.
Fisheries provide a vital source of food, employment, trade and economic well-being for people all over the world .
6563 2018-06-06 10:42:07 Power is a potentially lucrative export, just as water could be or oil is for Scotland. I hear people suggest it's somehow 'wrong' that we produce more electricity than we need... but we need to produce a whole lot more of everything than we need. It's called exporting! 
6564 2018-06-06 10:41:47 Guess you can rip off your sick and elderly any more that's why your saying he is the worst president ever!!! That's why Mr. President Trump is the best ever!!! He has stopped all the doctors and lawyers and rich oil men from stealingfrom middle class and poor!! #thanksmrTrump
6565 2018-06-06 10:41:44 But who cares about actually selling the oil at a profit? The production targets must be met so the CEO can get his bonus.

6567 2018-06-06 10:41:03 That tweet Frances is the most incredibly stupid uneducated tweet I have seen for a long time. Firstly we havnt left the Eu yet and secondly what on earth has the price of crude oil got to do with brexit. I hope you are well away from my kids.

6577 2018-06-06 10:39:59 Trump is also complaining about the rising prices of oil and he squarely blames OPEC and Russia for this as its creating a financial strain on U.S consumers. We are all squeezed by the rising prices of oil and worse when you don't have adequate fiscal capacity to subsidize it

6591 2018-06-06 10:37:34 We’ve become the major producer of oil.  That is good.  We need to use people for what they are good at now.  President Trump does want people to have the opportunity to change jobs and retrain.  He’s wants many technical schools including community colleges to offer more.

6656 2018-06-06 10:27:20 Literally nothing to do with BREXIT...its to with OPEC nations cutting production to raise oil prices and the US pulling out the Iran deal and placing sanctions...
6657 2018-06-06 10:27:19 It’s more than the price at the pump. My propane cap plan is $.55/gal more for the 2018/2019 season.  $1300.00 more this year. Fuel oil went even higher.
6658 2018-06-06 10:27:17 Yes, true, it's heavy oil and, at some stage, the cost of production has been more than the sale price.

6665 2018-06-06 10:25:59 Probably because it has very little to do with brexit and more to do with US withdrawal from Iran nuclear deal and Opec intentionally cutting production. Resulting in increase price of crude oil to 4 year high.

Oh. And one popular salad cream has a lot of sugar in it. Mayo? Never.

6704 2018-06-06 10:18:39 Defo all this just so we get cheaper palm oil 
6705 2018-06-06 10:17:59 Even assuming you're correct (& the market's touching faith in #Saudi ability to solve all demand issues bears fruit), one might be more preoccupied that nearly all world surplus #oil output capacity is in one country that's embarked on a possibly rocky transition. Just sayin'.

6707 2018-06-06 10:17:40 The Govt invest in Hydrogen Vehicles, but hydrogen engines burn oil & pollute like any internal combustion engine. 
The Tories are lagging the world! (pardon pun) by protecting engine & oil industries at the expense of EV infrastructure & low impact fast transit ie hyperloop.

6709 2018-06-06 10:17:20 @chriskresser just saw a commercial for Vascepa (“Pure EPA”).  Wonder why there isn’t a “just eat more fish” commercial, if you want the benefits of fish oil.  Are you familiar with this new drug?
6710 2018-06-06 10:17:18 When you consider life as a gift, then you can't say: This life is ours. The one who ownes it gave it to you, to make you happy with children. Life is a gift of nature itself, it has always been. When you say: the ocean is ours and see how many plastic/poison/oil etc. is there...
6711 2018-06-06 10:16:56 People who are clueless will blame “oil cartels” for petrol increase in South Africa... the fact is, basic price is R7.52, but because @MYANC nodded on taxes and levies hike, we pay a ridiculous price.

6714 2018-06-06 10:16:27 Yeah, cans are nowhere near what they were. Even neck oil on keg recently has started to taste like Lager. Love their collaboration beers but guess we won't see much more of them anymore.

This is what we call imported inflation. stop misleading the nation!

Many oil related jobs lost ! Auto & bus building and repair jobs too.

Is Grand Paris Express a bad thing ?

6756 2018-06-06 10:10:08 Oil price appears to not be moved by its plentifulness/supply but regulated in such a way as to extort the maximum out of the populace pockets without damaging it too much #serfs
6757 2018-06-06 10:10:07 RBI raises repo rate for the first time in recent years. This is partly aimed at  stemming potential foreign capital flight. Rising oil/commodity prices and weakening Asian currencies have heightened risks of 1997-type Asian financial crises  near future.

6805 2018-06-06 10:01:43 I hope they solved the chronic oil consumption on these TSi engines. Loved my Ibiza with the twin charger but it used 1/4 - 1/2 litre of oil per tank of fuel.
6806 2018-06-06 10:01:35 They increased the levy in the latest budget. It's all grist to the mill of the fact that when they haven't simply looted the exchequer they've spent recklessly and without any control. Yes sure the oil price has been rising but our petrol goes to neighbouring countries 1/2

6846 2018-06-06 09:55:35 And why doesn’t he just leave the party if he sees so much problem...
And oil prices understood, but what ‘other’ high prices he cribbing about?
6847 2018-06-06 09:54:36 True sir. But rising oil price will play foul & poise cascading effect on inflation despite RBI's move. Bcoz they r unsure, as they said, about the movement of Indian crude basket. Money supply will be under watch, for sure but they need to maintain sufficient liquidity as well.
6848 2018-06-06 09:54:17 I was accused of being a robot as well. I don't bleep, leak oil or have any shiney parts. WTH, Twitter?
6849 2018-06-06 09:54:15 Why not 
When tightening commencences usually it's a cycle which has an upticks of 100-150 bps
if oil prices remain where they are inflation has just started to pick up 
Bond yields have already factored a 75 bps increase in interest rates

But I'm here talking about new investments, in particular about long term ones like drilling for oil, building pipelines and investing in refineries. These have significant economic and political costs.

2018: Kenya exports crude oil, & imports refined oil products

6863 2018-06-06 09:50:44 You do realise that New Zealand produces some of the lightest oil and high quality available which is why most is exported. Gas is far less polluting than oil which is why driving industry to heavy fuel oil is crazy, this is what the ban achieves.

6874 2018-06-06 09:48:16 To understand the importance of oil in Syria, what matters is not oil production but the share of oil in export and government revenue. Because of (formerly) subsidised domestic consumption, smuggling, cost, this graph does not tell the strategic importance of oil.

6987 2018-06-06 09:29:58 I can’t find the graph I saw sometime last week but the main contributors to us having higher prices is because of the fuel levy and the RAF levy. Those have been increasing constantly. Then also the increase in oil price and the rands volatility against the dollar.

1) if Horse Hill is "the greatest onshore oil discovery in UK history", why does today's CPR say not enough known for any meaningful reserves or resources to be assigned to it?
2) you say government "playing funny buggers" - what's it doing?

However, I can do anything nail related or stuff like handcare e.g. moisturiser, cuticle oil etc. Thanks!

7120 2018-06-06 09:05:09 If you mean the Torrey Canyon, they couldn't sink it because it had already run aground. They were trying to set the oil alight and limit the spillage.
7121 2018-06-06 09:04:54 RBI Indian central bank has raised rates to 6.25%. The Indian economy is expected to outperform in 2018, and Q1 was strong. But as MT has warned, 80% of its oil is imported and inflation has doubled in Q2. MT expects Q2 GDP to be surprisingly weak.

7133 2018-06-06 09:00:58 .@alexsteer takes aim at the cliche that 'data is the new oil'. Says that in advertising we are treating data like exhaust fumes not oil - we don't really use it to fuel the engine of what we do.

7141 2018-06-06 09:00:13 The biggest influence of the high fuel price at the moment is the taxes and levies that have been factored in along with a rising oil price. But mainly the taxes & levies.

7148 2018-06-06 08:58:14 Interestingly Aberdeen's association with oil production goes back further than many may think. In 1857 Miller & Sons started producing crude oil by processing Boghead coal. They closed in 1864 however, due to the high price of raw materials and being caught infringing patents.

7277 2018-06-06 08:33:54 That's true - full production was encouraged at all times, even when prices were low. However, despite the mismanagement, the total tax take from oil has still been at least 300bn (following the Norway model it would have been double that).

Oil price hike will be the end card for Your government. Why you don't worry about oil price hike? Why you never reduce the central Govt tax? You increase that tax when the oil price down. Oil price only will decide who is next PM. Take care.
7391 2018-06-06 08:13:09 Due to cost of a barrel of oil being 43.55 (dollars) in 2016, its double that today.

You can rub vegetable oil on your hands before cutting pepper. That way,  your hands won't have the taste on it when you're done. Also,  you can rub it if you want to get rid of the pepper taste/burn on your hands.

7540 2018-06-06 07:43:31 Baby oil and something rough like a flannel usually works for me, so I would guess any oil would do the trick!
7541 2018-06-06 07:43:18 It's land reform for me. Scotland has immense natural resources that can & should be marshalled for the common good. But that can't happen when so few folk own so much of the land. Renewables are the new oil. Nationalise land, build renewable capacity, and create an Energy Fund.
7542 2018-06-06 07:42:33 Saudi Arabia is concerned over transferring Kirkuk's oil to Iran as they have recently signed a contract to transfer 30K to 50K BPD by tanker to Iran.
7543 2018-06-06 07:42:12 As far as something illogical is concrned. Only 20-30% of generation is from renewable resources while remaining are from costly generation e.g Furnace Oil etc which costs alot of money thus the circular debt.

7557 2018-06-06 07:38:58 Quick clue.... Oil is priced in Dollars, the pound has fallen against the dollar since #brexit making oil more expensive because the pound is worth fuck all... hope that you can work that out

7559 2018-06-06 07:38:24 They ask #OPEC to increase 1 more million bbl,s production to compensate #Iran oil shortage due to #realDonaldTrump brigandage program. this is funny cause OPEC was born to stand against #7sisters brigandage program. not work for them.
7560 2018-06-06 07:38:16 Now caretaker has no authority to release any future funds so electricity is only being generated from existing funds. Mind u 60-70% of our Electricity Generation runs on Furnace Oil and Costs us alot.
7561 2018-06-06 07:38:06 First, we don’t have much spare capacity oil production and that spare capacity is OPEC crude. What is produced now will still have to be consumed. There is no ability to switch because there is no excess oil out there.

7652 2018-06-06 07:19:05 @BusinessDayNg, Nigeria oil reserves remain stagnant for 12 yrs. The only way available for the survival of almost 200 million people is for Nigeria to industrialize because the country’s crude oil may not invoke the desired economic development. Power sector reform is expedient.

7947 2018-06-06 06:18:36 America renewed the #waronislam in 1972, when US easy oil peaked. Many don't know that Pres Carter said public transit not important because it was small % of budget, and wasted $Billions on coal-to-petrol.
7948 2018-06-06 06:18:20 Btw this stupid country is the prime reason for recent hikes in crude prices. Their production declined so much that it breached the target set by OPEC for production cuts ..  the country is abundant in oil, but they can't even take that out of ground!!!!!!
7949 2018-06-06 06:18:18 She needs more olive oil.
7950 2018-06-06 06:18:01 Stupid, is when, you think all is perfect. Not so,.  Salt is Made how,,? Do we not spill oil, crude oil  . In the sea,
7951 2018-06-06 06:17:46 2- We have empty factories that we could fill with people we retrain and provide wind and solar energy products for the entire world who are far ahead of us in alternative energy. Totally wasted opportunity because all of his friends are in oil and that includes Putin.
7952 2018-06-06 06:17:45 I'm skeptical. Ayokong mag-skimp, eh. Ayokong gumamit ng filler ingredients like mineral oil, so halos puro almond, rosehip, argan, moringa, olive, at sunflower oils siya (my personal elixir). DIY sensibilities yung manufacturing, pero clinical yung packaging. Mala-Aesop, ganun.
7953 2018-06-06 06:17:42 Uss samay crude oil ka bhi price $130/barrel tha aur abh $80/barrel...ye yadh nai tumhe? Bhulgaye ya Andh-Bhakth ho?
7954 2018-06-06 06:17:33 This is really shameful. So this is where all the money collected during the crude oil slump is going! Well done.
7955 2018-06-06 06:17:28 You mean why only 3% want to live on an offshore oil rig?
7956 2018-06-06 06:17:27 @KenyanTraffic. The rains are back flat tyres again, but did you know that tyres need service too? Nozzles,inner side of the tyres need checking for small cracks finally the rims inner side 4 rusting that causes air to escape, polish and oil the insides of the rim to slow rusting

7962 2018-06-06 06:16:19 The Petroleum law that stipulates those % is yet to be passed. Secondly there will be no revenue from the early oil scheme we will be lucky if we break even best case worst case we pay to export oil at a loss
7963 2018-06-06 06:16:10 Maybe you believe that all the buoys removed from the data set for showing cooling have been pulled aboard ship and checked for oil leaks. I don't.

7970 2018-06-06 06:13:35 Stall of nuclear power in US was more than just losing public relations. Utilities saw flat demand for electricity, costs overruns on projects in progress led regulators to shield ratepayers, cheap early 80s oil/gas were easier to justify. This history is complex/multifaceted.

8000 2018-06-06 06:06:54 we also invested in a $4.5 billion pipeline to ship CBD oil to overseas markets. Quite brilliant.
8001 2018-06-06 06:06:11 Many conservatives don't deny climate change, auch as myself.

Republican politicians pushed climate denial to conservatives and other non-conservative republicans because of the oil lobby and corporatists.

Corporatism has seeped into and poisoned conservatism on some issues.

8081 2018-06-06 05:48:30 when i graduated college i smoked a lot of weed at home bc i was sad and listless and my mom got super annoyed and then the last time i saw her she said she's thinking of using CBD oil/lotion for some aches and pains :O

Are give hubs of Counterfeits. Literally Every retail shop in South C has fake products, oil, Vaseline, Including Industrial sugar. How you feel is your Problem.
8083 2018-06-06 05:48:11 This.
And add to the fact we got do much North Sea Oil money that has been squandered and nearly run out.
Would be interested to see a breakdown of income & expenditure  since WW2.
8084 2018-06-06 05:48:06 Did you know if you’re in garden east and want to cross over to garden west, a unique way to do it is enter zoo east entrance and exit west
8085 2018-06-06 05:47:57 And right now, I wanna spend another 1k for a lip oil...
8086 2018-06-06 05:47:56 If you drink a whole bottle of fireball whiskey, you'll find a similar result due to the mineral oil in it. :V
8087 2018-06-06 05:47:46 Weird cause my gas station prices tell a different story. Where do live that gas has been dropping in price, reflective of this great oil production?
8088 2018-06-06 05:47:45 I can’t really eat out due to my diet. I wish I could find places that had more coconut and less soy oil  I’m not a paleo apologist, because I don’t think the Paleolithic end of it holds up very well, but I understand beans and leptins and antinutrients and digestibility issues
8089 2018-06-06 05:47:34 I remember y’all clowning yoongi/jimin for a good week bc y’all were gonna send them argan and coconut oil for their bald spots :(
8090 2018-06-06 05:46:52 I just bought a cool new NEW 3DS  No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
8091 2018-06-06 05:46:34 And I need my oil changed and my new car key to get cut

8094 2018-06-06 05:46:08 It's fantastic! Zaps the oil right outta your skin without drying it out. For existing breakouts: toothpaste.
8095 2018-06-06 05:45:59 I saved them too ...  from 15$ and total collapse of the oil industry till 300$ and Inflation and yes total collapse of the world markets again ...  crude forecasting since 2015 ..  better flip a coin
8096 2018-06-06 05:45:57 I gasped as soon as I scrolled and saw. Josh. JOSH.

You did a good and I hope you get to oil paint someday
8097 2018-06-06 05:45:53 I’m anti pipe line too I admire that it gives people jobs but there just has to be another way! So much oil has already spilled into our waters. Only time will tell how much damage it has caused. But sadly protesting won’t help at this point it’s passed.
8098 2018-06-06 05:45:50 

I’ve been wondering why I’ve been feeling so sluggish lately! I just realized for some time now I’ve thought my chamomile oil was my jasmine oil, so I’ve been putting it on all the time thinking I had jasmine all over me but nooooo 
8099 2018-06-06 05:45:48 I make my own Mayonnaise as its allot healthier. Heinz salad cream is full of processed nasties such as Rapeseed Oil AKA Canola Oil which is very very bad. Best Oils are Organic Cold Pressed Coconut/Avocado Oil. @jonathansamuels @skysarahjane @SkyNews
8100 2018-06-06 05:45:39 There does seem to be considerably more studies on MUFA’s (olive oil) effects on different aspects of health though. Wouldn’t you agree?
8101 2018-06-06 05:45:29 We could have had pipelines and huge oil wealth for #alberta @jkenney as well as huge #realestate wealth in BC and Ontario and a Canada-US #NAFTA deal done. Instead we have no pipelines, sabotage of the real estate industries and no NAFTA . Idiocy or BY DESIGN? #cndpoli
8102 2018-06-06 05:45:27 sometimes you just have to throw lavender essential oil in the diffuser an call it a night
8103 2018-06-06 05:44:51 CBD oil puts me right to sleep ZZzzz

8105 2018-06-06 05:44:37 That was me getting a hot oil hair treatment. I felt like shit, and i looked like shit, but my hair came out looking fantastic!
8106 2018-06-06 05:44:16 Haha. Arrey Madam, you'll run out of oil and butter at the speed you're using it to apply on Gandhi butts. Point is- you feed a snake but it will always bite you. That's what happened. Bhindrawale was the creation of Mrs Gandhi and she paid the price with her life

8115 2018-06-06 05:43:08 Yes the most expensive oil now is Coconut Oil. Overtook Olive Oil also... I think we should think of importing #Coconut for oil
8116 2018-06-06 05:43:01 Shawn Mendes is like that olive oil mayo...I can’t explain it but he just IS
8117 2018-06-06 05:42:35 No more snake oil salesmen. No more quick fixes. We're going to have to take our medicine and it won't taste nice. But if we'd bitten the bullet ten years ago and pursued a sustainable path we'd be in a far better position now. Fans wouldn't have accepted it. Hope they would now
8118 2018-06-06 05:42:29 U dont know what u are talking about. Tan sri Sidek,ex Miti KSU was and is a great public servant. Imagine petronas not suffering austerity years despite drop in global oil prices.

8121 2018-06-06 05:42:05 Just used olive oil to lube a dry bike chain. She’ll be right? #itwasextravirgin #bushmechanicsitalianstyle
8122 2018-06-06 05:41:34 It came home all beat up from a fight and I tried to clean it’s wound it freaked out scratched me and spilled my precious oil and made me cry
8123 2018-06-06 05:41:31 I didn't say higher prices John (though they were, with oil prices). I said more. The means more PRRT & more income tax eventually. So yes, good.

8168 2018-06-06 05:33:12 @IndianExpress is this really a oil price reduction. It is daily rise but to smokescreen it is one paisa to eight paisa decrease. Praja Ko jo chaho pirso beechare rojmara Ki bhaga bhagi main sabh chala lete
8169 2018-06-06 05:33:11 Exfoliate! I use a coconut oil and sugar scrub every other day then wash my face regularly and go behind that with noxema face pads. It’s cheap & works for problematic skin
8170 2018-06-06 05:33:09 Remember 10 years ago when the oil companies fear mongered the shit out of us saying the world only had 10 years left of oil? And here we are, with a massive surplus, PAYING MORE than we did at $150/br. 
Oil companies BOO.
8171 2018-06-06 05:32:37 You are both. Remember, outside of the US and Saudi Arabia, Venezuela has the largest oil reserves. Its not helping their starving people or corrupt dictatorship  hiding in democracy skin is it?
8172 2018-06-06 05:32:20 Alberta doesn't control the oil prices, but being land locked with the US harms Alberta's opportunities. And not being able to get one damn new pipeline built to overseas markets also decimated future production.

8208 2018-06-06 05:23:52 Gas always goes up in the summer as fuel transitions to gasoline that can better handle the temp.  Iran is also flexing oil power after Trump pulled out of Iran deal.  Educate yourself before you spout nonsense.
8209 2018-06-06 05:23:39 Could it be that unimaginative governments are trying to buy jobs instead of using their customary subsidies paid to dinosaur gas and oil industry to invest in sustainable, green, energy ?
8210 2018-06-06 05:23:29 This is why the Democrats must get their act together and unite and pick a strong candidate with a fresh and realistic platform in 2020. Trump must run on his record and cannot sell the public the “snake oil”,like he did in ‘16.

8213 2018-06-06 05:22:33 And Kishore, not to forget, the Transport Ministry policy on eVehicles offers no real green credits or subsidies like in the US that aim to reduce dependencies on imported crude oil. Their recent change of heart to drop the EV policy will only hurt (1/2)

8217 2018-06-06 05:21:52 Too many oil companies are f-Ing with the Earth's core. Fracking. Drilling too deep. Did the BP disaster teach us nothing?
8218 2018-06-06 05:21:51 I really like one my Andalou naturals it's rose scented and makes your skin super soft I use rose hip oil too

I get that you have a hard job.

You are literally destroying our country.

I hope you have oil soaked nightmares and wake with the courage to do right by your fellow humans and the beautiful world we live in.

7. Fund higher eductn and research
8. Fight poverty and hunger.

8223 2018-06-06 05:20:21 I wanna go pool sunday but i am so black , that when i go swimming, people think i am a oil spill.

8224 2018-06-06 05:20:13 I went to Elle’s house to get Elle, and I left with Elle and paper towels, dish soap, dog food (wet and dry), a 32 oz bottle of olive oil and a bottle of oregano. So if you need me, you know where I’ll be. At Elle’s.

8233 2018-06-06 05:17:06 « He senses confusion, but then realizes that he's being dumb. »

I have a feeling the car form is kind of irrelevant compared to uh... this one.

Well oil is used to keep things lubricated and running smoothly. Also keeps things from overhearing. And a car wash is well, washing.
8234 2018-06-06 05:17:01 Hey @WBrettWilson is there a map available to show the Oil Pipelines ? This is in your wheel house, isn't it ?

8242 2018-06-06 05:15:12 I use essential oils on hayzen! I made a butt spray that i spray him with each time to help aid & prevent rashes. Id definitely recommend lavender oil tho since it’s soo aggravated.
8243 2018-06-06 05:15:10 Im fucking hungry but I accidentally left some oil on the stove too long and got yelled at so now Im afraid because I dont feel worthy to use it right now but we dont have any ready to eat food

8245 2018-06-06 05:14:45 I was so confused by the burn barrels not actually being used oil drums that you burn paper in.
8246 2018-06-06 05:14:23 I think we need an oil painting of @EBischoff to present to him at @Starrcast18
8247 2018-06-06 05:14:22 Melanie was in the shop for a standard Disney audio-animatronic update. And, an oil change.
8248 2018-06-06 05:14:11 Uh no. Very little electric is generated by oil. In BC as in Canada, the majority is generated by hydro. Bike, walk and use electric transit to get around.
8249 2018-06-06 05:13:27 Just how stupid are you. That's not a question it's a fact. Do you know what facts are there the truth.

8253 2018-06-06 05:12:43 If you ever saw him in person, you’d know. His body does look worn out. Kinda moves like the Tin Man without the oil. Hell, and that was probably 3+ years ago when I saw him. Gotta be worse now.
8254 2018-06-06 05:12:42 When you can get some try @NaturesUltra I’ve partnered with them so if you like what you see use ALRYJAZZ15 at checkout for 15% off. I’ve been using their CBD oil for couple months and it’s been a game changer. Good luck 
8255 2018-06-06 05:12:24 "Buying more with less" im not sure how you are hoping to achieve this. Prices do not freeze with salary feeezes. Other input costs like oil continue to increase regardless.
i would also like to understand what a non-traditional increase is.

Spewing pollution and odours 24 hours a day, ruining the air quality for 100,000s of people for the benefit of a multinational oil company. Fossil fuels are a dying industry and the sooner the refinery closes the better.

8260 2018-06-06 05:11:40 I suggest you study what happened in the 80s when UK govt sold our national oil company to big business and Norway held on to theirs.
8261 2018-06-06 05:11:12 Ships used to run on more than 100 tons a day. Back when oil was cheaper they would race from port to port, only to lay anchor because the port is keeping to it's own schedule, not the boats' 

Sometimes they would just do circles instead of lay anchor. Doing laps. Burning fuel.

8290 2018-06-06 05:05:27 The risks are starkly basic, and 'they' know it. Borrowing against potential oil revenues can lead, and has led, to debt crises when the oil revenues consistently fall below forecasts. Fingers crossed .Ke doesn't continue growing its debt appetite.

8326 2018-06-06 04:58:12 @mabena_bob @Powerfm987 When I started to drive in 1972, a gallon of petrol was about 70 cents. The US then created a bogus oil crisis in 1973 which led to the steep rise of petrol prices we are complaining about today.

8328 2018-06-06 04:58:06 The situation in Venezuela has very little do with socialism. It's largely due to the collapse in oil prices and crippling sanctions placed on it by the U.S simply because it refuses to be bullied. If socialism was the problem, why does Maduro keep getting elected?

8348 2018-06-06 04:54:50 Despite repeated pledges to eliminate fossil fuel subsides G7 countries are continuing to subsidise oil, gas and coal, fueling dangerous climate change with tax-payers' money #EnvironmentDay

8353 2018-06-06 04:54:01 Things I’ve been led to believe are basically magic “fix every problem in my life” potions: 

-kombucha
-apple cider vinegar 
-coconut oil 
-kale 
-kefir 
-chia seeds 

I’m convinced if someone were to mix them all together and drink like a cup a day they would be a superhuman.

8374 2018-06-06 04:49:59 We had several years of low oil prices. Government saw the chance to ratchet up the taxes on fuel to make up its huge budget deficit. As usual it’s timing was awful. The oil price continues its rise and petrol is heading towards R18/litre. There is big trouble headed our way.
8375 2018-06-06 04:49:48 Yo loosing the little top to my Doo Gro hair oil errrks me 
8376 2018-06-06 04:49:29 @ndtv @aajtak @RahulGandhi @ravishndtv  Govt has failed in overall balancing - one extreme is higher oil prices and inflation -other extreme is poor earning of farmers. Its failure of country as a whole and not a particular party! The real question is who is going to correct it?
8377 2018-06-06 04:49:21 Too bad the oil industry killed the water powered car like 50 years ago.

Only R2.56 margin is shared between the Oil Company and Fuel Retailer, yet the petrol price cost R15.79 (GP).

8410 2018-06-06 04:44:32 Look at the Alaska dividend as the closest thing to UBI in the world. Who pays for it? The oil companies. And what do you want in life? Do you only wish to buy food and rent? Would you do nothing if you started each month with $1000 or would you treat it as a raise?
8411 2018-06-06 04:44:30 By now y’all hv figured it out that oil will not be cheaper anytime soon.. 
8412 2018-06-06 04:44:09 The oil belongs to someone else for five years..

They did the cost analysis and found this to be a cheaper option.

After five years we should build ours in Turkana

8421 2018-06-06 04:43:00 .....Angola produces oil, of SADC can find a way of cooperation, there can be a way to bring down cost of fuel. But Angola has always been such a closed country under Dos Santos, things are looking up now under Lourenço, let's hope it's a sign of good thing to come even for fuel!

8455 2018-06-06 04:37:46 Add about 1/3th extra oil.  If I ever burned the top, I would use a bread knife and cut it off.  One weird thing though, if u add some extra water and some extra rice (I was pretty intoxicated).  If u do it right, the texture is amazing.  I failed the second time.
8456 2018-06-06 04:37:44 Of course we can't reverse it. But we should try to limit it. Which is what we should have done from the start, but hey... heaven forbid the auto industry and oil companies change when they can just keep racking on the money.

8464 2018-06-06 04:36:27 It wouldn’t be accepted because our exports are too diverse and would be too destabilising for the EU to accept. Norway produces mainly fish (exemption from CFP hard won) and oil - which ironically it only competes with the UK over.

8472 2018-06-06 04:34:44 I guess it'll win in the end, see the price of oil barrel, people start buying electric cars, the surge in demand can't be supplied rapidly, nuclear is fast and cheap to deploy, economy wins

Follow Venezuela or the Arab nations on best practices in oil production management.
Kenyans must stop any nonsense meant to compromise the people's expectations !
8501 2018-06-06 04:30:52 The problem is that you are honest. People only give money to snakeoil sellmens, not to people in need, so start getting some snake oil to get your ass of that country ;)

8505 2018-06-06 04:29:22 Tbh makeup remover is the biggest waste of money. Coconut oil and a nice cleansing brush are all you need. Lasts much longer, does a much better job, and better for your skin.

8514 2018-06-06 04:27:01 You wont get the sense on oil prices even if it falls directly on your head, prick! And you started the debate, leave anytime you wish to and give chance improve the overall IQ of my timeline manifold

8517 2018-06-06 04:26:34 you never know, oil could be leaking onto your belts, your belt snaps and gets sucked up into your oil pump and now you have belt pieces going throughout your engine and thats something somebody could’ve seen before it happened at an oil change shop and could’ve informed you

8531 2018-06-06 04:24:41 Mike! Since you’re clearly uneducated as to the enviromental, Social n economical benefits n risks(an educated persons weighs them before making public judgments)why don’t we cont. putting oil on trains n burn towns and leak mill of L more oil then any pipleline  Cntstoptheoil

8533 2018-06-06 04:23:56 the only thing i disagreed with is just because your car gets to the place to get an oil change doesnt mean it’ll get home. i see engines seize up all the time randomly. you never know especially if you have a super bad oil leak
8534 2018-06-06 04:23:43 why it’s just oil egg yolk vinegar n lemon
8535 2018-06-06 04:23:39 「Open source and business, people said at the time, mixed as well as oil and water」って、俺の知ってる10年前とだいぶ違うのだが…それは2000年くらいの話のような。
8536 2018-06-06 04:23:30 I understand the oil Market. Why are we exporting when gas is shooting through the roof? Taps off for exports. Ask yourself this if it's such an open market on oil why do the Saudis pay pennies for a gallon of gas
8537 2018-06-06 04:23:24 Totally agree. Nothing should be subsidized.I wouldn’t say increase tax on oil to make green more attractive tho. The end result would still be the consumer getting shafted. I’m not a climate change denier but I also don’t believe in being broke today to maybe help tmrw
8538 2018-06-06 04:23:20 @dsdcmofficeup I have made a complain regarding oil leakage from transformer and damaged of polls on 1912 two weeks ago but no action taken in this regard till yet. Kindly do needful. Mob 8004905900

8560 2018-06-06 04:20:18 and not everybody inspects their engines everyday and make sure there is nothing leaking or anything wrong and not everybody has sensors who tells them somethings wrong so when they do get an oil change and somebody recommends something they’re probably right.

8574 2018-06-06 04:17:55 I heard you put coconut oil on it
8575 2018-06-06 04:17:55 ya i dont have the issue of taking it to just oil change places. i’ll take mine to a dealership. the guys at normal oil change places can see oil leaks that u didnt and recommend u take it somewhere. i just disagreed with the point that just bc it got there doesnt mean its fine

8645 2018-06-06 04:07:53 You're right, Lillian, though Pruitt certainly is the most corrupt of Trump's appointees.  He's also the most untouchable becsuse he's effective at destroying the EPA which has been his desire for years, hoping for an eventual huge reward from Big Oil.  Despicably selfish man.
8646 2018-06-06 04:07:47 I prefer to be very good at certain things (particular market segment, oil,  bonds etc.) then mediocre in many.
8647 2018-06-06 04:07:37 Yes, I use to get them all the time. I even tried  taking them off w oil and eye makeup remover but it still takes off your lashes 
8648 2018-06-06 04:07:17 I miss when nobody used tea tree oil & it was always in stock for me to buy. Good ol’ days
8649 2018-06-06 04:06:47 I hate oil paints.....
8650 2018-06-06 04:06:35 Saudis pumped extra oil as Kush asked Qatar for $500 million on 666 property  5th, Trump's magic Ave, Trump supported Saud & other emirs blockade of Qatar while 10k US military personnel were on base in Qatar. Kush got $185 million "loan." from Qatar. OLIGARCH MONEY. Trump crime!

8654 2018-06-06 04:05:30 Very interesting recipe. I can’t cook curry that way or I’ll die or go to jail.Everything you put in the pan, MUST go in a bowl, well mixed up and marinate at least two hours. Then I have to “burn” curry powder in oil in the pan by itself then toss that stuff in.

Feckless GOP Congress

8664 2018-06-06 04:04:17 my dad asked me if i got oil on my silk robe yet and i told him no and he was like i bet you will by the end of this week. and why did i just get cocoa butter on it....

8674 2018-06-06 04:02:49 Gee the price of oil might have something to do with it.

8677 2018-06-06 04:02:30 So true this phone I'm using is made of plastic. But that doesn't mean it's the future. Adjust now, transition now or be left behind. Oil can't be the future, it must become the past.

8680 2018-06-06 04:02:04 Like getting prices of oil up.. by putting sanctions on Iran, Venezuela and Russia to..so he can sale more weapons to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait..
8681 2018-06-06 04:02:01 It’s very soothing! If it’s 100% pure make sure to dilute it! You can use something cooling like a se sensitive/fragrance free lotion or coconut oil
8682 2018-06-06 04:01:58 the "map" was of natural gas pipelines for home heating purposes, not oil pipelines

8684 2018-06-06 04:01:49 Gee I winder if it had anything to do with the price of oil plummeting? It’s amazing how the pevious governments that squandered rainy day funds while the price of oil was up don’t get any blame.

8694 2018-06-06 04:00:26 Basically, it is irrational for you to be giving medical advice to strangers over the Internet. You are not an expert because you have read some internet articles.

8697 2018-06-06 03:58:58 I'm gonna go on record and admit that I might have purchased snake oil from you somewhere in the vicinity of the Villages apartments. No proof yet but it's coming.  There might be photos though. 
8698 2018-06-06 03:58:55 @sagarikaghose Hell with your poor knowledge.What about a Sikh Guru being fried alive in hot oil and another Sikh Guru's sons being buried alive in a wall?Keep your liberalism to yourself.Your only animus is against Modi and those who eulogize him for the great work he doing.
8699 2018-06-06 03:58:50 dip it in olive oil a coat it with parm cheese. mmm
8700 2018-06-06 03:58:34 got this 54 oz jar of coconut oil. Eli swear I be puttin mayonnaise on my skin
8701 2018-06-06 03:58:16 By the way if you are allergic or sensitive to petroleum jelly like I am then I would not recommend getting the sweet sweat gel and putting coconut oil on instead. I put the gel on and broke out in an itchy rash because I'm allergic to petroleum. It is also a toxic substance
8702 2018-06-06 03:58:13 Umm don't forget that 7 trillion dollar ( and counting ) fake war of choice that we didn't even get a tiny oil well from that Republicans started . 
Your words not mine 
8703 2018-06-06 03:58:07 Let me guess...the microwaves from cell phone towers are activating the fluoride that we’ve ingested from our water supply to potentiate the neurological damage that we have all sustained from the vaccines that were forced on us by #BigPharma Also, Monsanto or something.
8704 2018-06-06 03:58:01 Stupidity is not being able to understand that "covered in oil" is used to mean having a specific look that appeals to society's idea of men's sexual desires. I'm convinced that pick me/colorist twitter all failed English class cause y'all be coming up w/ the dumbest shit
8705 2018-06-06 03:57:59 My skin is crawling  my mom found a tick just biting into my dad's leg and all he did tonight was mow the lawn. Fuck this I hate ticks. Time to go bathe in teatree oil  #fuckticks

8708 2018-06-06 03:57:32 Good luck in prison you orange snake oil salesman
8709 2018-06-06 03:57:29 If Canada ceased production of oil it would keep that oil from entering the market.  Oil in the ground does not pollute the atmosphere. As 10th biggest GHG polluter, Canada has a job to do. Ethical behavior does not depend on what others do.
8710 2018-06-06 03:57:07 No the sweetsweat is the brand name and I put coconut oil underneath it because unfortunately when I used the sweet sweats gel ot caused me to break out in itchy rash because it has petroleum jelly

8713 2018-06-06 03:56:50 Extraordinary that the Minister of Finance confirmed to select cttee today that he’s had no advice from treasury on economic or cost of living impact of oil and gas ban. Does he not care about economic impact or is he worried about what the advice might be?

8716 2018-06-06 03:55:30 This will only benefit Saudi Arabia (the ones responsible for 911), Saudi Arabia is getting Israel to do their dirty work against Iran, and keep the oil prices high.
8717 2018-06-06 03:55:15 Was Acosta the Kim bitch that tried to stand up to a man?
8718 2018-06-06 03:55:12 Working in the oil field is hard work. :) can you just point me in the direction of facts on how the Ndp has destroyed Alberta as you said. Not trying to cause problems, but I need data.
8719 2018-06-06 03:55:00 Fair comment. Given the nature of the pipeline debate these days it seemed implied you were speaking more specifically to oil. Thanks for the clarification!
8720 2018-06-06 03:54:54 yes, sbb dia ada tea tree oil
8721 2018-06-06 03:54:53 Nasal spray to spray up your nose and olive oil in the infected ear. Use a cotton ball to put the oil on itso you can stuff it in the ear.

8725 2018-06-06 03:54:22 I recommend watching on bleaching videos on YouTube and put coconut oil in your the night before you bleach it
8726 2018-06-06 03:54:21 Hmm, CERI's high case forecasts oil sands crude supply to grow by 4.8 million b/d by 2038. That's 10 TMX pipelines worth. The oil sands is transitioning to something, alright...

8734 2018-06-06 03:53:24 It really is! I often love things like this in theory. But reality would have me spill some sort of greasy concoction (like motor oil) all over it. LOL
8735 2018-06-06 03:53:21 Thanks girl I just tossed it in a little olive oil, parm & black pepper & put it on a baking sheet for 25 min on 375!
8736 2018-06-06 03:53:21 Disappointed that today's @theheraldsun piece on petrol prices forgot to mention one option - don't drive. We're forced into car dependence and thus oil dependence by decades of transport policy. It's time for a change!! #getonboard @CommutersCount @ptua #auspol #vicpol

8742 2018-06-06 03:52:33 Trying to stop the blaming by counter-blaming is like trying to kill a fire by pouring oil into it. There's no such thing as an org w/o people. If we want to change anything, we need to rethink our social contract in a mutual, systemic way - leaving out blame.
8743 2018-06-06 03:52:30 In almost country of the world 20% blending of recycled oil in new oil is permissible. & its very necessary & compulsory bcoz oil can't be destroy so recycled of re refined oil must be blended in new oil at any how.

8746 2018-06-06 03:52:20 The strike is over but there's rumors the gov isn't doing their part of the deal. Oil companies are on strike now and we don't know what will come of it.

8750 2018-06-06 03:52:02 old man is backing off sayin"there's no trouble, its ok." I felt an arm on my shoulder & it was the young man.

8753 2018-06-06 03:51:45 I never asserted they were all oil pipelines.

8754 2018-06-06 03:51:45 That Plan C pill always work. And it's cheaper. 3 dollars baby oil and stairs at Grandma's house. Always do the trick.
8755 2018-06-06 03:51:44 How is polluting our planet, or our country worth any money? Fossil fuels aren’t even sustainable. Oil is overrated. Pipelines always leak. You can’t be pro-environment and pro-pipeline.  A great PM should turn Canada green  and make legit jobs.
8756 2018-06-06 03:51:39 So today i got an oil change and you know how they check your lights? Well i was wondering why when i opened my car door and all of sudden there is a beeping and then i asked jake and he said Holly are your lights on? I was like oh...
8757 2018-06-06 03:51:38 I bleached it completely today for the first time in a couple months and dyed it all today so it’s super dry but I’ll get new conditioner tmmr and try out coconut oil :))

8770 2018-06-06 03:50:03 Respected Pradhan Sevak, Pradhan Rakshak. It's getting clearer that our party is slipping in the eyes of the public.They seem to be less impressed with your continuing foreign engagements & want answers for soaring prices & oil price.Time to be politically inclusive in our party.

8774 2018-06-06 03:49:19 Online oil filtration of all types of oil is necessary for system. because oil is product of hydrocarbon so oil itself create carbon, that's y any types of close loop system need online cleaning. we provide a service of online oil cleaning of all types of oil.

8776 2018-06-06 03:48:50 I’ve heard also he opened up some oil pipeline and people didn’t like it. He’s covering up the bad he’s doing while playing the victim of the US tariffs.
8777 2018-06-06 03:48:45 In a hell bent for election. Effort  to convince all of us climate change is real.  You wanted to sue big oil. and you did. Settling out of court    Gave you the chance to embezzle  millions   60 cents a gallon guys.  Everyone of you d mocrats has a tv commercial.    That's al
8778 2018-06-06 03:48:40 The other countries there are all major oil importers, although US is moving towards neutral on liquids.

8781 2018-06-06 03:48:28 I’ve been applying vitamin e cuticle oil every week. Also, after I remove my nail polish I wash my hands because the acetone is really drying for your nails. Then I apply the oil then a base coat! Also, I think taking vitamins helps too
8782 2018-06-06 03:47:51 There's also the bit about the rapidly recovering oil price which was an amplifier for Canada, not for many others.
8783 2018-06-06 03:47:50 Thinking about joining the oil rig life pretty soon.

8790 2018-06-06 03:47:00 Maybe you should think about positive economics affect too, that Cambodia do not have much resources like oil and gas to gain income. In addition, you should know that the government are also Khmer people, not foreigner, who saved the country and are developing the country.
8791 2018-06-06 03:46:53 Syrian army sources say their units have take teo posts from SDF in #DeirAzzor provinces east of #Syria bringing the military to retake koniko oil field one of the richest in the country.

8793 2018-06-06 03:46:31 I like their growth oil, A LOT. 

I need a solid hold, keep the fluff.
8794 2018-06-06 03:45:59 You can change my oil anytime ;)
8795 2018-06-06 03:45:48 I did a quick once-over with vinegar, then added an Epsom salt/pink Himalayan salt/CBD oil bath mix. I shall try that Trader Joe’s cleaner! I’m always open to new natural cleaners  Mrs. Meyers products are my kind of holy water. Thanks for the input!

8798 2018-06-06 03:45:13 Ideals our politicians follow are petty parody of greed for money & power. Nothing much, nothing less. Evident they are feeding on ignorance of uneducated & poor. Snake oil sellers don't last, but we've got lots. Nepal needs #education to rid of this pests & #soonWewill together
8799 2018-06-06 03:45:08 "We're probably getting more oil soon" is. 
8800 2018-06-06 03:44:52 It’s just a high flavor, less filling “dressing”. Tablespoon of pesto and however much olive oil you like. Feta is my fav but it’s not very Italian of me. LOL that comes from my Zcech/Lebanese side

8808 2018-06-06 03:43:47 Yes but the majority appear to be gas and not oil.
8809 2018-06-06 03:43:34 Aku pakeeee ini. Tapi lebih ke karena nyoba aja sih. Ngga se-wah review rang orang. Tetep juara miscelar water kalo aku. Kalo perlu unsur oil, tinggal campurin baby oil aja kaaak.

8824 2018-06-06 03:42:05 Only an internet racist wouldn't say it to olive oil's face
8825 2018-06-06 03:42:00 No actually, it's you demanding I let you spill oil in my backyard, some of the most pristine land in the world, so that you can pay less for gas. 

Every pipeline spills. There is no pipeline in existence that hasn't.
8826 2018-06-06 03:41:37 And because of medicine my son’s memory didn’t form properly. So I WISH I had tried the CBD oil instead of the medications because he probably would’ve been better off.
8827 2018-06-06 03:41:31 We have some of the highest fuel levies and taxes in the world. That has got nothing to do with market conditions such as ZAR/$ exchange or oil prices

8832 2018-06-06 03:40:54 We had two industries in crisis. Fishing operations were suspended until the oil spills were cleaned up, and oil companies were laying off employees daily. Over 100,000 people were suddenly unemployed from three major oil companies alone.

8837 2018-06-06 03:40:21 I love sprouts in any fashion, but roasted is right up there at the top. A little olive oil, some balsamic vinegar, how 'bout a bit of honey and some Parmesan to finish...

Okay. Now I need a snack. #FoodPorn @fargo_t

8842 2018-06-06 03:40:07 It is 10:40 pm and my boyfriend has been underneath my car, getting torn up by mosquitoes, sweating his butt off, getting tons of oil on him(i have an ongoing oil leak, that’s the next project), replacing my starter for me. Talk about GRATEFUL AND BLESSED to have the man I do!!!!

8844 2018-06-06 03:39:46 Ok. You must be old. Because phenobarbital is rarely used....especially in children, due to the HORRID side effects.  CBD oil contains ZERO THC-you know the compound that gets you high. 

And so what if people are stoned? People drink liquor too which impairs them. Legally

Hypocrisy never stops.
8859 2018-06-06 03:37:51 Oil must be a luxury good now. Have to strip the commodity moniker.
8860 2018-06-06 03:37:41 No. 
Alberta is hurting because Alberta doesn't control the price of oil.
All it took was a couple of years of below breakeven oil prices.
OPEC got tired of losing market share to a bunch of frackers and tar sands firms. 
All it took was them not cutting production.

8872 2018-06-06 03:36:39 When people say "black men only like darkskin women when they are covered in oil.” They mean that they don’t get as much appreciation when they’re wearing anything more than a bikini. You missed the whole point and started taking random shots at big women. Mentally deficient.

8879 2018-06-06 03:35:45 But you can always just use less of it and still get good results. But if you are super oily, I’d say go with tarte because the Amazonian Clay will actually absorb the oil and dry matte. (: but test them all out and see what you like best.

8892 2018-06-06 03:34:27 The fact you think that CBD oil is drugs shows your ignorance. 

The fact that you think because I believe in legal marijuana means I partake in THC containing products is amusing, but it’s untrue.
8893 2018-06-06 03:34:21 If you have oily skin, the Amazonian Clay BB cream by Tarte is pretty good. Also Make Up Forevers Ultra HD Skin tint is amazing. And Laura Murcier has a great skin tint as well available in oil free. And IT Cosmetics CC cream is amazing, but a little fuller coverage.

8909 2018-06-06 03:33:23 Jameni, creating a parallel between a coal powered plant and oil exploration is just off the mark. The point of course is taken that both are toxic.

8913 2018-06-06 03:32:30 As far as I know the greens want 2 refine oil locally. It would be nice if we took advantage of geothermal in bc.

8925 2018-06-06 03:31:20 Middle East oil is readily available; it flows out of the ground ready for the refinery. Oil sands need to be mined, mixed with mostly imported diluent, shipped to a foreign refinery that's special built to remove the heavy metals and add hydrogen, and still costs more.
8926 2018-06-06 03:31:08 And we won't miss
What you're doing through us
How you're building through us
And we won't resist

Fresh oil, new wine
A mighty move of God in our midst
And we won't miss
This mighty move

8927 2018-06-06 03:31:04 What an unbiased source, Charlie!

You spoke at the 2016 meeting of Independent Petroleum Association of America. You've admitted TPUSA has fossil fuel industry donors.

Energy independence? We'll never go to war to take another nation's sunshine. ( Oil is from ancient sunshine).
8928 2018-06-06 03:31:03 I’m not sure you’re aware, but a couple of years ago Saudi Arabia flooded the market with cheap oil and caused a major recession in the US. Louisiana’s entire economy rides on two industries, oil & gas and seafood. On top of the recession, there were a number of oil spills...

8930 2018-06-06 03:30:46 We can disagree on what caused VZ’s dire economic situation & clear distinction between nationalization & democratic socialism. You challenge Chavez’s success with social programs until fall of global oil prices and over reliance on same for govt revenue? What regs & hostility?

8941 2018-06-06 03:30:13 hmmm...maybe that 4.5 billion they found laying around & want to use to bail out a Texas oil company?

8947 2018-06-06 03:29:43 also of note

8951 2018-06-06 03:29:08 Well, not really massive. They have a social savings account. They tax oil heavily to fund education, healthcare, infrastructure, and diverse investment. They're sitting on about a trillion $.
8952 2018-06-06 03:29:06 Pervert..
Cost of oil has increased because of increase in international market.
And taxes paid while buying fuel is used to build infrastructures like this. 
If increased price of fuel is hurting common people so much then how come sale of motor vehicle is seeing an upward trend
8953 2018-06-06 03:28:59 Thank you for invoking our sense of responsibility for God's Earth, Pope Francis! Bless your continued vocation in all its myriad aspects. Be forceful when you meet with the oil company executives! Big Oil has much to atone for, both to the planet & via wanton greed.

8964 2018-06-06 03:27:23 The tools of repression must be taken away from the mullahs. The mullahs cannot be allowed to have billions of dollars at their disposal to torture & kill the suffering Iranian nation.  No more oil money for the mullahs.
8965 2018-06-06 03:27:17 BOOM!
8966 2018-06-06 03:27:11 Energy East would have helped to take on the Russians and Saudis supplying oil & gas to Europe while KM would ship to Asia...then we have both bases covered and not relying on the US at a huge discount

8978 2018-06-06 03:25:29 Lol omg Seriously.  Please let me know of any eco solutions that are more profitable than oil and gas.  We are generations away from eco technology that will be more efficient and offer cost savings.  Sadly there is a lot of waste from turbines & batteries that go unreported.
8979 2018-06-06 03:25:26 I actually just started using CBD oil a couple weeks ago, and so far it seems to help.  One bottle will probably last you quite a while, but price varies a lot based on strength.  You can even order online!
8980 2018-06-06 03:25:22 "value of the process"

What is that value?

HERS is a fraud. 
Claiming monitary value exists where you can't provide ANY evidence of it existing is snake oil sales.

Do you want to be viewed as a snake oil salesmen?

Best not to claim value exists if you can't back it up.

8983 2018-06-06 03:24:57 The idea is to get the oil to China. That means the pipeline gets to cross over 800 or so rivers on its way to BC so the supertankers can run aground somewhere.

8998 2018-06-06 03:22:07 I think before we stop using plastic...
Govt. can stop its production as once there is no more production how one can use..
NB : MNC food co are also using plastics for their product ..
Chips, Biscutis , oil many other products.. first ask them to stop using plastic ..

6. There was peace and harmony,
7. Inflation rate was at 0.1%,

9016 2018-06-06 03:20:11 Do you know why the world is actively pushing for hemp based cbd oil while suppressing marihuana?

Because you need fields full of hemp plants to produce hemp oil, but a single plant can produce a lot of marihuana based oil.

It's all about the business model.

9054 2018-06-06 03:15:31 Hi #Jenheads and #TwitterFriends! Most of you know Im building a small team to help me sell #HempOil & help me educate people on its health benefits. THE # 1 QUESTION any of us get is... "Does cbd/hemp oil help with  (insert ailment or condition here)".
9055 2018-06-06 03:15:25 We don't even have the same as Britain who at least allows CDB oil.
IT's not just the humans left to suffer, they won't even allow it for our pets.
9056 2018-06-06 03:15:24 24 people from YWAM Yosemite will be attending YWAM Together In Thailand this September. We apologize in advance for the okieness and strong scent of patchouli oil that we’ll be bringing.
9057 2018-06-06 03:15:12 I tried giving Sam some peanuts, he was unimpressed. So tonight I went and got him some olive oil sardines thinking maybe the skin and bones are more familiar to him. He's loving it.
9058 2018-06-06 03:15:08 Add oil and bake it in the oven for a few hours.
9059 2018-06-06 03:15:06 Seeing all of these special gel make-up removers that you simply wash off with warm water has me curious. 

Why not use coconut oil? (Obvs, if you’re allergic, I get it)
9060 2018-06-06 03:14:55 Try rubbing coconut oil.
9061 2018-06-06 03:14:51 Gee, that could be WHY she cares about these things. Its abt the FUTURE & what kind of place is left for the kids! It's OBVIOUS Trump &/or GOP do not care abt them!(See global warming, EPA, offshore oil drilling incl the North Slope of Alaska, Massive DEBT incurred from "Wall"...

9063 2018-06-06 03:14:47 I can't believe I was actually offered to do product reviews for what seem to be beauty products & possibly essential oil stuff, which I can dig it. I think that would really help give more content ideas for my channel...at least when things die down some. 
9064 2018-06-06 03:14:25 i pakai safflower oil as moisturiser. boleh ke?

9068 2018-06-06 03:13:38 I am not sure, but I suspect it will be some non-meat based oil as it would defeat the whole idea

9072 2018-06-06 03:13:21 Ernie Crey has given up hope of the future. The future is not dependent on oil, mining, or stripping the forest. Future for our world, our people is protection of the Earth.
9073 2018-06-06 03:12:51 Baby oil or the chocolate sauce?
9074 2018-06-06 03:12:51 I stan the neutrogena hydroboost water gel for moisturizer and I also use their pore scrub a couple times a week to keep my face snatched. I also use a beard oil which is good for my facial hair and the skin underneath 
9075 2018-06-06 03:12:47 Or change the oil, reach things they used a step ladder to put on the top shelf to start with, kill a spider, leave the house without looking for shit in their hand for an a hour.. watch out!

9080 2018-06-06 03:11:23 I don't know a single person on the coast who is in favor of offshore drilling. Who do you think funds the majority of the state? The last thing we need is an oil spill.
9081 2018-06-06 03:11:22 Yessir. I’m zooted! I got some oil that I ingest also to help me sleep
9082 2018-06-06 03:11:21 My ear doctor visit was a waste of time and money. I  have read about hearing airs that can possibly block that with noise that counter acts it. I may go check into it. I'm just not too excited about wearing hearing aids.
9083 2018-06-06 03:11:12 .@FoxNews All my life I wondered how the German people could fall for a monster like Hitler, now we're watching it in real time #MAGA and #TeamTrump following like sheep this snake oil salesman and  GOP Congress abetting his antics is a hurtful as anything I've ever experienced
9084 2018-06-06 03:11:10 sorry, but there's no such thing as expanding the oil industry responsibly
9085 2018-06-06 03:11:09 yall if u want crazy soft skin put coconut oil everywhere while ur still kinda damp from the shower

9087 2018-06-06 03:10:56 You ever watch Krugman on that Sunday talk show?  He insists on silence when it's his turn to speak.  Then interrupts everyone else every 5 words.
The asshat doesn't know the meaning of 'discuss'!
9088 2018-06-06 03:10:48 Have to get a car wash and oil change in the morning !
9089 2018-06-06 03:10:42 Helichrysum is an amazing essential oil too, known for its nerve restoration powers. Do the flowers really do this at night? Also guys, #botaiku ? Just discovered heaven for this avid gardener and poet!

9093 2018-06-06 03:09:59 I’m not sure what you’re selling, but the oil company I work for is buying! #inone
9094 2018-06-06 03:09:55 Yes, agree. Have done some reading about CBD oil with and without the hallucinogenic ?THC? Have a friend with advanced prostate cancer & some pain, so recommended he give it a try as was anxious about the pain. Don't know if he did but it's legal where he lives in the USA.
9095 2018-06-06 03:09:46 I started a new Calendula infusion today. I’m gonna make an eye cream and stretch mark oil. 
9096 2018-06-06 03:09:34 Our servicemen have killed and died for lies, corporate profits and the oil that powers the cars we drive, but IMO "there are no war heroes" is ultimately self defeating. If you want to compete with the propagandists you need to wake the sleepers without poisoning the well. 
9097 2018-06-06 03:09:29 Will help your grow. So long as it's not Alberta Oil.
9098 2018-06-06 03:09:15 After living through the gas rationing in the 70s and the rising gas prices because of Middle East oil, this is amazing!!!!

9108 2018-06-06 03:07:02 My hand are burning from that oil paint  shit it’s fucking annoying
9109 2018-06-06 03:06:52 Apart from the drying time they're so much easier for how I paint? Like I paint very fast and gestural, and the way oil paint reacts w itself / blends together actually makes it more forgiving. I love how you can work back into it, you can literally wipe a mistake off w/ a rag

9115 2018-06-06 03:05:45 The fact NO company is scrambling to collect all this free "oil" floating on the SURFACE everywhere just shows there is NO SHORTAGE of oil either.
9116 2018-06-06 03:05:44 yeeees, mix a little vitamin E oil with it. make sure you apply it with a mascara brush every night (i just washed an old one off) or look at the drug store.

9124 2018-06-06 03:04:15 Tim Duncan was great as a collegian and pro. Recognized, but still underrated imo. And Wake has struggled nightly for the past several years. They’re about do for an oil change.
9125 2018-06-06 03:03:51 @equusreined @itsanoma it's alfalfa sprouts, pea shoots, mixed greens  with hummus, red bell peppers, cucumber, carrots w/ chia seeds, hulled hemp and a home made chipotle olive oil dressing. XD added chicken after too!
9126 2018-06-06 03:03:35 Mine are all in boxes and in the attic. I can’t bring myself to throw them away. They may get displayed when the game throne arrives. I didn’t realize there was that many snake oil expansions.

9134 2018-06-06 03:02:41 Map isn’t inaccurate but it is showing the gathering systems for oil and gas(primarily gas) from wells to processing facilities. Stupid to compare this to a transmission like like KM
9135 2018-06-06 03:02:37 people still use coconut oil to moisturize?? In this heat???
9136 2018-06-06 03:02:17 That sounds strangely ... good, except for the oil.
9137 2018-06-06 03:02:04 Why? This has nothing to do with oil anymore as you are intimating. This now has to do with Russian hegemony over the region. Assad wins in Syria, Russia builds a naval base in Syria just north of the Suez canal.
9138 2018-06-06 03:01:52 $60 for my oil change. Cover it
9139 2018-06-06 03:01:48 art is cool because if i put this massive oil painting of me getting rawed by hyper muscle fruit stripe zebra in a gallery a bunch of pitchfork writers will look at it and go "wow epic"

9145 2018-06-06 03:00:30 While we are at it , we can take control of all their oil fields to fund the war and when we feel like we can finally get a pro American government in place .. we give our new allies the oil and we no longer have a threat . But that is a solution that may come with its own set of

I wasn’t assuming you meant anything in particular.

9195 2018-06-06 02:54:17 How do you clean you cast iron pans? I do the coarse sea salt and hot water method, followed by drying on the stove top under med flame, then reapply oil to the whole pan while the pores are open.

Re: "Shifting away from pollutant-heavy coal+oil to natural gas/other energy sources WILL slow the rise in CO2"

9233 2018-06-06 02:49:47 1. is not correct. The oil that is produced to replace that displaced by this policy is going to be more expensive/harder to produce. Otherwise it would already be being extracted.

9260 2018-06-06 02:44:31 Maybe it's a capacity issue? Oil units tend to have smaller nameplate capacity (few hundred MW) compared to coal. Smaller units better suited for islands which need less power. Just a guess.

9270 2018-06-06 02:43:20 Nggak apa-apa  Saya sebenernya juga kurang yakin ada atau ga  Kalo untuk alternatifnya, bisa pake essential oil yang wangi lavender (coba tanya teman-teman yang aktif di Young Living atau perusahaan produsen essential oil).

Shifting away from pollutant-heavy coal+oil to natural gas/other energy sources WILL slow the rise in CO2.

"But look, oil prices are negatively correlated with quantity supplied"

9343 2018-06-06 02:35:14 These are great suggestions, especially the mushrooms.  And go heavy on olive oil, that’s good cholesterol.
9344 2018-06-06 02:35:05  then instead of a facial wash, Exfoliate. I use Freeman products. It comes in a black tube. That will get deep in your pores and remove dirt and oil. Idk about the wipes tho honestly
9345 2018-06-06 02:34:52 Old oil can Parker 
9346 2018-06-06 02:34:39 Check your blood pressure lately?

9348 2018-06-06 02:34:00 Mystery to me. We have four hypotheses (at least I do): SRM, Big Oil, to debilitate Solar; Biofuels, inadvertently ruining everything but not wanting ti face it b/c its so cheap; cloudseeding, for hogging water; and military, for satellites and DEW. But your question is right.
9349 2018-06-06 02:33:48 How can an organism like the @OAS_official and the @ONU_es work when there are countries with Communist ideology or that the Dictators buy them with oil? @ Almagro_OEA2015 @marcorubio @RosLehtinen @mike_pence @SecPompeo What a disappointment. ?? 
9350 2018-06-06 02:33:21 Nope!                                                                                                             Because this discussion is about oil tankers through Metro Vancouver, not YVR. Let's not deflect the #TMX to be about things...it's not about!
9351 2018-06-06 02:33:20 saying black men only like darkskin women when they are covered in oil is fucking crazy lol
9352 2018-06-06 02:33:14 Hitler had one objective ,take all of Europe and the Balkins ,he did not go to war for just for  oil ,no he wanted domination of Europe.
9353 2018-06-06 02:33:07 Our Tamil Nadu CM has ordered banning of all plastic use except for milk, medicine, cooking oil from 1st January 2019. I wonder what stops the Union Government in issuing similar order nation wide and supporting the yeoman cause to stop ruining future generations, please?

9357 2018-06-06 02:32:52 Yeah 100 litres in 65 years of use. Not a bad track record. The locomotive that is running the rail cars full of oil to BC is leaking that much every 100kms.
9358 2018-06-06 02:32:51 I read tea tree oil sprayed on the ankles keeps them away, so I use that, no idea if it works, but might be worth a shot for you. I haven't had one on me yet, but then maybe its only mosquitos that find me tasty.
9359 2018-06-06 02:32:40 When in doubt, don’t use truffle oil!

9364 2018-06-06 02:32:15 Phrasing!
9365 2018-06-06 02:32:14 sure i get that. but:
1. when cars/busses switch to electric, the market will collapse
2. we will still use oil - but the amount of oil we'll need won't justify oil sands expansion
3. the fact that i'm using oil now is irrelevant. we are trapped into supply chains and products
9366 2018-06-06 02:32:12 Gotta say, just had a quick lunch...we all know I love my food...and plenty of it. I went to Joeys joint, Lil Lipari in Maude St Shepp...Steak, Pasta, Bread with oil OMG #saladdodger #amazingfood
9367 2018-06-06 02:32:11 bio oil & moisturizer twice a day, I used the acne wash once a day
9368 2018-06-06 02:32:05 Very dubious and essentially fraudulent.  A non-starter project for any real oil and gas company
9369 2018-06-06 02:32:01 Adorable. Can't steal oil if you're using it all to fund democracy.

Points for effort.
9370 2018-06-06 02:31:57 Me thinks that maybe you meant peak oil demand, then again probably not as your understanding of the oil and gas industry appears limited.
9371 2018-06-06 02:31:53 Hey shit stain! Maybe focus on getting off social media with devices that are made from oil products you hypocritical tool! Go hug a tree and get off the grid that normal hardworking people use!

9379 2018-06-06 02:30:48 The existing pipeline is not being taken down. It will stay operational and a new pipeline will be added. That's not an upgrade, that's adding something new as well as keeping the old one. The old one that just spilled oil.

9381 2018-06-06 02:30:47 If you like bullpen's leaking oil. At this rate Davis will be on the DL by mid July
9382 2018-06-06 02:30:40 This is absolute bullshit.  Diluted Bitumen is a product few people want and it has a huge carbon cost.  Let's not even get into the economic loss that this "investment" will cost.

9385 2018-06-06 02:30:32 OPEC +Russia prefer reduced supplies, China and all developing countries want lower oil prices. American supply is not going to hold for long. The only thing that I can see for Saudi to increase supply is to take over the Iranian supplies while the US has sanctions on them

*Not incl. buying Trans Mountain pipeline)
9395 2018-06-06 02:29:33 Ohh yeah, then a buttermilk bath would seem like nbd to you. I do about a cup of buttermilk, some epsom salt, and a few drops of lavender oil. It’s very pleasant!
9396 2018-06-06 02:29:28 It's not for nothing that they're called Saudi Barbarians. Riyadh is for oil and sand, not scholarship.
9397 2018-06-06 02:29:26 for my hyper pigmentation I used bio oil and witch hazel, for my acne I just used this generic acne wash from walmart
9398 2018-06-06 02:29:21 Blockchain sounds promising and I'm waiting to see the first true breakthrough. Cryptocurrency though sounds like snake oil mostly due to the sheer amount of bullshit surrounding it.

9409 2018-06-06 02:26:58 One of the shamans there noted that "If we don't fight the oil companies, who will?" If the earth is our body, this forest is our lungs. I encourage you to examine your own lives and ask what you can do to protect our beautiful earth.

9433 2018-06-06 02:23:44 Weird distraction story @theTiser on art-buying sheiks. We import more crude oil from Asia than the Middle East. OPEC struggles to set prices since US oil production (#3 in the world) doubled in last 10 years. Do more stories on local "rich s--tbags" ripping people off!
9434 2018-06-06 02:23:39 but must it always be so? specifically, do we HAVE TO use oil for transportation?

9450 2018-06-06 02:21:21 Great, more oil use. I thought we were trying to move away from that. Remember Global warming??  Well, I guess in the future when the environment is a mess, we can say that 70 years ago JT created some jobs.  Maybe they'll feel better...

9459 2018-06-06 02:20:10 I actually had to supplement my fat with coconut oil, eating spoonfuls to get my content high enough. The tricky part is protein, needs to be high enough to repair muscle tissue from working out but not too high that your body uses that instead of fat for energy.

9462 2018-06-06 02:19:52 It isn't sustainable economically, environmentally, nor politically. It is a shameful surrender to big oil. At the very least think of your children. You and we are better.

9470 2018-06-06 02:19:01 The NDP (along with the idiot feds) failed in their quest for "social license", cranked up energy sector uncertainty, introduced more regulations and costs, and drove out investment in what was once a business friendly province. That's what happened to the fantastic oil sector.
9471 2018-06-06 02:18:59 And we get cheaper oil.
9472 2018-06-06 02:18:01 Having a car is a trap- I need an oil change, a new sticker and I have to get my emissions done
9473 2018-06-06 02:17:49 Not all vegan food is healthy. Sometimes they have to soak things in oil for it to have some flavor which is probably a lot more carbs than eating burger but their are some vegan Foods that are healthier and taste better.

9482 2018-06-06 02:16:58 Kalau Kelantan dan Terengganu menuntut oil royalty lagi, kali ini mereka akan berhadapan dengan AG Tommy Thomas. Familiar name to them, sebab TT dulu adalah peguam mereka dalam kes tuntutan royalty dulu tu.

9487 2018-06-06 02:16:32 Today as a Canadian I'm ashamed. A gov that places a higher value on Oil, gas, billions buying pipelines than is citizens. . A self centered superficial society so distracted by capitalism that they can quite literally eat a meal without noticing the corpses of the homeless & ill

9491 2018-06-06 02:16:21 "It puts the lotion on It's skin, or It gets the hose again!"

Me: Does it have Coconut Oil?
9492 2018-06-06 02:16:19 I agree let’s remove all pipelines. Water, oil, natural gas and draft beer!!!
9493 2018-06-06 02:16:11 Serai Wangi merupakan tanaman yang paling umum digunakan sebagai bahan dasar untuk pembuatan obat nyamuk. Tanaman ini mengandung citronella oil yang aromanya segar bagi manusia, tapi sangat tidak disukai oleh nyamuk.
9494 2018-06-06 02:16:03 Nabilone and CBD oil seem useful during opioid tapering and for patients with neuropathic pain. Edibles containing THC seem beneficial for neuropathic pain, but are too risky. Inhaled forms not preferred for medical purposes, just recreational.

あれは、私が大学生の頃にBIKE用品専門SHOPで、貰った椅子なんですよ。元々は、本当にOILが入っていたそうです。中は綺麗になっていて物入れになっています。

- shale oil/gas 2016, etc.

9509 2018-06-06 02:13:51 Yet, you find money to buy an oil pipeline.
9510 2018-06-06 02:13:44 I asked the clerk at WFoods where I could find olive oil. He says I'll show you.  Shit! Just tell me, I don't want to hang out together.

9512 2018-06-06 02:13:38 They will look exactly the same. Nobody is asking these people 2 answer questions about politics, have hours of service, 2 go out & make a difference in the lives of young people. All they want is for them 2 get a tan, oil up & show off their muscles.
9513 2018-06-06 02:13:35 Burnaby. The pipeline is going to Burnaby as it has been for 65 years now. This is just an expansion to increase the flow to get more oil to market.
9514 2018-06-06 02:13:33 Everyday I ask the same thing...must be the big oil/gas money  or..oh! Yes! The #corruptGOP who have NO ETHICS!!

9520 2018-06-06 02:13:16 Three questions for chic fil a. How many gallons of oil do they use each year. Does price of oil fluctuate by epa regs in the supply chain what epa regs do you have to follow to dispose all that used oil?

9524 2018-06-06 02:13:03 No; it would be 1-2 big oil producers & China determining the USD's FX rate, not China's.  If this was happening, one would expect the US going around the world almost irrationally picking a fights w/Korea, China, Germany, Canada...which is of course exactly what US is doing.

9580 2018-06-06 02:06:37 We're barely doing this now @GasBuddyDan , it most certainly is a 7X' s increase in oil tanker traffic no matter how you spin it! It's not an enviro spin @GasBuddyDan , it's common sense, the same reason @MarcGarneau is moving the train around Lac Mégantic instead of through it!
9581 2018-06-06 02:06:26 Peppermint oil is essential for my mood.
9582 2018-06-06 02:06:23 • Close the bathroom door 
• Limit your time in the shower to 5 or 10 minutes.  
• Use warm rather than hot water.
Wash with a gentle, fragrance-free cleanser. 
• Apply enough cleanser to remove dirt and oil, but avoid using so much that you see a thick lather 
9583 2018-06-06 02:06:12 He may be the dumber one, but appears to have a bit less snake oil on the body
9584 2018-06-06 02:06:08 Also I much prefer something so mild you have lather up 2 or even 3 times of your hair is really dirty. I typically have a scalp full of neem oil so I gotta lather a lot. Following with A good conditioner is a must. Or aloe vera, that transformed my hair
9585 2018-06-06 02:06:07 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.

9591 2018-06-06 02:04:41 I run deodorant between my thighs or bio oil lol . Or wear leggings . I NEVER wear shorts to the gym because I can’t
9592 2018-06-06 02:04:24 One Gwh storage since 2015 great! But global energy use in coal, oil, gas in the same time frame equals 420 Million Gwh per British Petrol 2016/15/14 Annual Energy Review. Not "undeniably making a difference" as per JT Straubel. Someday yes, when we hit 42 Million Gwh of storage

9595 2018-06-06 02:04:04 And how big are these barges @GasBuddyDan , compared to an Aframax Oil Tanker that can carry 650 000 barrels of diluted bitumen? You condescendingly call this hysteria and sillyness when in fact, this is my City and these tankers sailing by my home...Of course I have concerns!

9597 2018-06-06 02:03:26 ON can't easily implement this directly since we do little oil/gas extraction. So down more to Federal level, where >$3B/yr goes to fossil fuel industry. But if subsidies went to greener energy & tech instead, it'd def. be cheaper. Esp. w/ solar & wind $/KWh dropping as they have

9601 2018-06-06 02:02:59 If that was remotely true (tectonic shifts) it would mean 1-2 big oil producers determining China's FX rate. From a national security and economic point of view that would be a very dumb and risky policy to pursue.

9617 2018-06-06 02:00:40 We used to have Kenya Refineries when we used to import crude oil. Now we have crude oil, but the Refineries is gone due to corruption and greed. We are using its storage facility to store the oil as we look for best bidders to refine the same...

9619 2018-06-06 02:00:24 When your brain gets too constipated from work or school, try including brain-boosting foods to your diet! Avocados, beets and coconut oil contain the nutrients you need to fuel your brain. #healthyeating #healthtip #TuesdayMotivation

9626 2018-06-06 01:59:28 Well, Canadians should really be concerned that Alberta's oil fund (tar sands) is nowhere near Norway's sovereign wealth fund (offshore oil) #cdnpoli

9629 2018-06-06 01:59:05 You understand that you get 45% of your oil supply from Canada. You also import a lot of electricity and fresh water. You want to live in the dark and pay $10/gallon for gas?
You should read before you tweet.

9637 2018-06-06 01:57:28 How do you bottle & sell snake oil? trump knows. You inflate an issue and make it seem like God & Country. Never mind trump and his campaign met with Russian agents to flip the election. The Kremlin must beam with pride.
9638 2018-06-06 01:57:26 Taking over 13,000 from big oil is fighting big oil? Dave Jones a much more progressive choice that will get it done #DJ4AG
9639 2018-06-06 01:57:10 Spending they have, not reducing any costs. This is what ultimately brought the crisis. Many countries that depend on oil suffered, but  not as bad, and what amplified the crisis in venezuela was the absurd amount of intervention the regime has. that's a natural in ...
9640 2018-06-06 01:56:37 What Houston has is too many lawyers and oil executives who buy up all the seats and don’t show up to playoff games on time

9646 2018-06-06 01:55:56 Feeling a bit lost/out of it? Ok. Go to the kitchen: chop garlic, mince ginger, roast portobello mushrooms, roast sweet potato w/dash of spicy sesame oil, make dashi, julienne carrots, marinate slabs of tofu, do a spring onion chiffonade, wash spinach leaves, breathe.. 

mmm, yes

9648 2018-06-06 01:55:50 High taxes and a weak rand dollar exchange rate are a function of economic policy. The mismanagement of our oil stocks, refining policies, oil and gas exploration, do nothing to help. Then there is our gov’s failure to support Sasol locally and in Mozambique

9653 2018-06-06 01:54:45 Rate it's happening now, but there were problems. I was in venezuela in 2007, and there were already some shortages in food, constructions were stopped, unemployment was on the rise and crime was starting to soar. Now, it all exploded when oil prices dropped and they lost...
9654 2018-06-06 01:54:41 Okay I’ve had 2 drops of the CBD oil and 2 pieces of chocolate and don’t really feel much in terms of relief. Am I doing this wrong? When did Marijuana was so much easier in high school

9658 2018-06-06 01:54:10 There is a lot of oil up for grabs......
9659 2018-06-06 01:53:48 But he’s taking from big oil? Has not prosecuted Exxon, Dave Jones however is the complete opposite
9660 2018-06-06 01:53:39 But that's my favorite. Especially with a tablespoon of coconut oil?
9661 2018-06-06 01:52:59 Hey @ScottPruittOK I wonder when all of your chickens are coming home to roost? P.S. I like mine fried in peanut oil too.@MichaelEMann
9662 2018-06-06 01:52:51 Nope. I might have oil and vinegar? And there's butter. Mayonnaise. Some German mustard. Chili garlic paste. Gochujang. That's about it. Maybe some eggs, but they're 2+ weeks old.
9663 2018-06-06 01:52:41 Belts, 3in1 oil, rubbing alcohol on a q-tip and occasionally hot glue. I fixed so many tape decks with just these 4 things. Its rarely a burnt up motor or anything like that. Its just dried belts and gummed up gears. Hope you get it working, looks like a nice unit.

9666 2018-06-06 01:52:33 gross stuff is that oil
9667 2018-06-06 01:52:32 Venezuela has the biggest oil reserves in the world. More than the Saudis. The government did not spend on the refineries. It cost more to refine crude. It also has an instability between poor and rich before Chavez. One main reason they voted for him the first time.
9668 2018-06-06 01:52:24 Why have islands historically used oil for power generation rather than coal?

Enough time to, try, fail, skin your knee, dress the wound, pick the scab anoint it with vitamin-e oil & watch the scar fade while you retain all the memories & lessons. All before gallantly walking into your 30’s, fierce and flawless. You good
9673 2018-06-06 01:50:57 and their agenda is to suppress CDN oil...at the benefit of U.S. oil

9675 2018-06-06 01:50:35 The high yield of #palmoil means tt the area required is lower than any other competing crops. EU Commission report: if we replaced it w soybean oil, we wld need 200%+ more land... 1/2

9687 2018-06-06 01:49:06 I need the beard oil from @EvenAarons
9688 2018-06-06 01:49:05 Try some baby moisturizer to build a base tan, has similar compounds to suncream but you'll get colour without burning so fast. Anything with "oil" in the title is very dangerous for tanning.
9689 2018-06-06 01:48:52 How much is bio oil?@BioOilUS
9690 2018-06-06 01:48:31 Australia is on to this too. Looking at russia & saudi oil cartels

9692 2018-06-06 01:48:30 there’s so much coconut oil in my hair it looks wet  yes skincare, but don’t forget about haircare, girls and gays.
9693 2018-06-06 01:48:26 Dulles is the usual place. This is a disgrace. Moving it out of the City of La Mirada, snake oil campus AND 2 marketing table outside the door. Shame on our public servants on ALL counts.

9700 2018-06-06 01:47:44 That might work...at a strip club. But remember what Juicy J said: “it ain't a strip club if they ain't showin' pussy.”
9701 2018-06-06 01:47:42 I guess you want to install a right wing puppet and steal their oil then...

9703 2018-06-06 01:47:22 When did it become fashionable to not work? Working is not greed. 
Many First Nations work in the oil and gas industry and are not opposed to the industry. 
These people are Not sellouts. They know the industry values the environment.
9704 2018-06-06 01:47:20 Ummm, GW Bush, Cheney, Halliburton maybe? They hired him in their admin full of oil executives and agenda?

9707 2018-06-06 01:47:10 I added some paprika and cumin, garlic, salt and PEPPAH, and pan fried in olive oil

parsley for garnish
9708 2018-06-06 01:47:09 Do you believe climate change is real? If so, you can't make Canada even more dependent on oil than it already is. Canada can't afford to become a single-commodity economy. No Canadians enjoy the uncertain boom/bust cycle they're jolted through every time oil prices change.
9709 2018-06-06 01:46:42 niggas out here oil changing whips and flexing them on snap lmfao
9710 2018-06-06 01:46:36 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
9711 2018-06-06 01:46:30  “The arugula is good” and all he did was add some lemon zest and olive oil
9712 2018-06-06 01:45:58 Why? Because we are saying NO to 7X's more oil tanker traffic through Metro Vancouver for no good reason in the world other than for money? Here's an idea for @JustinTrudeau , don't do it and slow down on the spending before we have to build Northern Gateway too!

9719 2018-06-06 01:45:08 @ChrisCuomo @CuomoPrimeTime I read where China has offered to purchase $70B in goods from America to reduce the trade deficit. Our guys say as long as it’s not oil, that doesn’t reduce cause we would sell it on the world market. Maybe that’s Trumps strategy all along

9723 2018-06-06 01:44:56 Oily Skin: 
Clean your face at least twice a day with the same moisturizers or scrubs. Don’t switch up on your treatment. 
Don’t scrub at your skin. It can make it more irritated. 
Use oil free products.

Creole tomatoes marinated in olive oil and red wine vinegar with parsley. Roasted veg. All in a summer's dinner bowl.
9725 2018-06-06 01:44:13 You're trying to justify shipping oil through Metro Vancouver by pointing to the shipping lanes of the Anacortes, quite a distance away! The #TMX is about adding this new activity, a 7 fold increase to all the you describe. That hardly justifies MORE does it @GasBuddyDan ?
9726 2018-06-06 01:43:49 me: stop juuling ur gonna get lung cancer!!!!

9734 2018-06-06 01:42:23 This has been around forever, since before snake oil salesmen,  and will probably always be around. Bc there will always be ppl who want easy solutions so bad that they are willing to believe anything and those who find it easier to work scams than do real work.
9735 2018-06-06 01:42:04 Coconut oil
9736 2018-06-06 01:41:54 You clearly have no grasp of history.
9737 2018-06-06 01:41:21 made in the US - why can’t they make the soap in Ghana then? It rains there and they have oil - we do with  #Hemp - why not advice them to grow #hemp and make soap and leave the palm out of it, you say it grows great! How long to grow hemp? Your ethics appear purely cosmetic
9738 2018-06-06 01:41:16 The bonus is with Canada getting its already found Oil to market there is less reason to drill in pristine areas.  It ain’t perfect but it is better than drilling the Arctic or off the Coast of Africa.  FYI we need Energy East but NO to Northern Gateway!  JMHO!

9750 2018-06-06 01:40:31 "Right - and the dozens that pass south of Vancouver from Alaska and Asia, filled with oil to feed the 5 Washington State refineries are are just an inconvenient truth." There are no Washington State refineries in the Burrad Inlet nor can you get to any through the Burrad Inlet!

We deserve better than this!!
9762 2018-06-06 01:38:50 True Botanical clear oil. AMAZING. Pricey but you only use like 3-4 drops so this is going to last me a year.

9764 2018-06-06 01:38:46 Venezuela is in crisis due to lack of diversification of exports.  Oil being their primary export.
9765 2018-06-06 01:38:36 The US doesn’t give a dam about Venezuelan people or democracy you just want their oil rich fields
9766 2018-06-06 01:38:34 Trump wanted Iraq oil.Him and Putin have so much in common none good.

9771 2018-06-06 01:38:03 Actually, that's not really it.

Dubai had nothing and had to rely on trade.

From leaders to ordinary people, they all knew what a disaster it would be if trade dried up, so, even before they found oil, all efforts where geared towards making them a prime trading destination.

9773 2018-06-06 01:37:54 We do not need these oil fields. Russia does not need these oilfields. They poor Syrian people need them desperately. My God we are so flippant and insensitive about their suffering.
9774 2018-06-06 01:37:54 Dan. Heavy oil such as dilbit is not flammable AFAIK. OTOH, light crude from North Dakota's Bakken Basin is as flammable as it gets - very low flash point as natural gas liquids (butane/propane, etc.) mixed in with same. Same stuff in Lac-Mégantic disaster.

9783 2018-06-06 01:36:59 Your boy BARNING HARD will be on the gulf this weekend if anybody wants to buy me some drinks and/or dinner.. 

Also will get in your yacht and cruise around.

Also will rub you down with oil if you’re a female and/or look kinda like @G130J.

Also will let you take me fishing..
9784 2018-06-06 01:36:32 And now Mike Pompeo touts Trump as being very tough where Russian sanctions are concerned. Huge lie. It's only because of Congress' resolution that Trump cannot remove sanctions. So, yeah, that keeps world oil production down.
9785 2018-06-06 01:35:51  oil change for sure

9788 2018-06-06 01:34:56 Here, probably 80% can get some type of formal training along with OJT. The one downside we do see in this area is housing. We essentially ran out of housing when the oil boom hit. Almost every major company has either built or rented man camps for their employees.
9789 2018-06-06 01:34:44 It's not about the pipeline @GasBuddyDan , in case you haven't been following along. It's about oil tankers, the risk of a Lac Mégantic type oil fire in Metro Vancouver or an oil spill risking our sensitive marine ecosystem and the people / industries the depend on the sea.
9790 2018-06-06 01:34:29 Tell the Trump administration to reverse course and keep Big Oil out of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
9791 2018-06-06 01:34:18  @realDonaldTrump, he's just mad because nobody wants to come see him. Sissy ass attention whore! Go wash that orange ass spray tan off and put some coconut oil on that ratty ass toupee! 
9792 2018-06-06 01:34:14 Not exactly. We export it at oil link prices to Asia at @ $15/mmBtu on 20 year contracts. We can import US LNG for 30% less thanks to the shale gas revolution.
9793 2018-06-06 01:33:43 Why would you want to? The woman that would enjoy that tripe is trash.
9794 2018-06-06 01:33:31 It’s made to go on the grill. I put the veggies in a ziplock bag, dump in some virgin olive oil, a dash of Janes Crazy Mixed up Salt, mix it up, 15 minutes later put it on the grill
9795 2018-06-06 01:33:21 Have your fish with lots of grass-fed butter or other good fats. Keep your simple carb intake low but double your non-starchy veggies. Protein stabilizes your blood sugar, good fats (butter, avocados, olive oil, etc) make you feel satiated, non-starchy veg fills the tummy. #yum
9796 2018-06-06 01:33:07 You
9797 2018-06-06 01:32:38 But the establishment stopped saying no to cholesterol (though I think the situation isn't cut-and-dry). They stopped saying you shouldn't eat eggs. The seed oil issue is more complicated. But change happens. Should it happen faster? Maybe. But are you going to do that by lying?
9798 2018-06-06 01:32:37 จริงค่ะ...ถ้าได้ดูจะไม่มีใครผิดหวัง
9799 2018-06-06 01:32:14 oil was discovered on this tweet.  america will begin bombing in 5 minutes.  for humanitarian reasons.

9801 2018-06-06 01:32:00 Start with a lightly dressed salad or veggie soup to start and have a veg with light oil as a side!

9803 2018-06-06 01:31:55 i've been getting a lot of acne again since i went to sj and i think it might be the oil cleaner i bought from muji : (
9804 2018-06-06 01:31:38 Now you are getting somewhere...the oil embargo likely allowed the USSR to survive the 70s just on the basis of accruing European hard currency. But it was borrowed time. Something, something...shale revolution.
9805 2018-06-06 01:31:29 This has been an unfortunate evening. After much work I no longer feel comfortable calling myself a man. That oil change took way to long.. I apologize to everyone who thought I was better then that.

9809 2018-06-06 01:31:11 How many hospitals are powered by wind or solar in van? How would you cycle without grease in your bearings, oil on your chain or rubber on your wheels? Give your head a shake man! The most enviro friendly thing u can do is reduce. It’s all just marketing to sell stuff.
9810 2018-06-06 01:31:00 like Samurai Jack after it, it's always okay when it's """oil"""
9811 2018-06-06 01:30:45 You weren't doing the bidding of the Koch brothers and gas/oil industry......the grift is on.
9812 2018-06-06 01:30:28 Went on field trip with my son today to the zoo. Walked over 13,900 steps today. I am tired and sore. I will be a tin man tomorrow. Who’s going to bring me some oil for my joints?
9813 2018-06-06 01:30:18 If Bernie isn't the next president I hope the new President puts him in charge of something like going after the banks, drug companies, oil industry and reenforcing the consumer protection bureau. 

As we have seen, cabinet members can do a lot of good and bad.
9814 2018-06-06 01:30:13 Well, so much for me watching. The show just went down the shit tube
9815 2018-06-06 01:29:56 this is an open forum for all senior ocean city students for the senior prank, what’s our plan? crickets, ladybugs, farm animals, everyone bring in olive oil and pouring it in the halls, same thing but with lube, mariachi band following matina, anything? ideas are needed

9817 2018-06-06 01:29:34 I take cbd oil for pain management oil under my tongue or vape for bad migraine days, I also use a cream/lotion sometimes at the site if it's really bad.
9818 2018-06-06 01:29:29 Oil smells way better and is long lasting. Once you learn your body chemistry and what mixes with it, it smells so much better.
9819 2018-06-06 01:29:19 Surely other rich/developed countries also have similar crude oil reserves. Indeed, every country run by anyone who has brains would be doing so. Why just single out China?
9820 2018-06-06 01:29:18 Mediate and run an oil diffuser
9821 2018-06-06 01:29:02 You can go all out on fatty meats . Pork belly cooked w butter. 
Bacon fried w additional pork lard.
Salad drenched in olive oil.
Fatty sashimi w oil dressing. 

Dont need to stick to normal looking food. If is easier. Trying to do normal looking food makes keto tedious.

9831 2018-06-06 01:28:04 The "Evil" Oil industry provides great paying jobs to tons of ppl. And Canada needs to get our oil to world markets. But hey, keep on fighting. Your taxes have already subsidized it being built. So it will be. Thanks for your share of 4.5 billion$. We appreciate it here in AB. 
9832 2018-06-06 01:28:03 I voted PCs in AB but got the NDP. They're are doing a pretty good job & have moved towards a centrist position on Oil&Gas. They're helping diversify the economy, allowing me to do game development without moving to Ontario/BC. The PCs no longer exist here so voting NDP next time
9833 2018-06-06 01:28:03 United States bringing freedom to a country with huge oil reserves & demonizing their leader? Naaahhh!

9840 2018-06-06 01:26:54 I would also say use an oil with a high smoke point. That’s always been my problem. Used to have to open all windows every time I cooked steak
9841 2018-06-06 01:26:51 Only temporarily. Short until need to go long again. I'm long $BP though. I hope you pull a lot of oil and make great money doing it. 2 sides to every trade. Good luck man
9842 2018-06-06 01:26:51 Dude, no one is buying the snake oil you are selling. It's so crystal clear that you are a crook who hangs with other crooks. You can quote you flunkies on Twitter all you want, but no one is buying this crap.

9867 2018-06-06 01:22:50 In my county (SLO), the race for my board supervisor (5 sups in county) is related, for example, to the entire county's vote to support or not support  offshore oil drilling. Which affects all of us in CA directly or indirectly. My district is a swing vote district for the board.

9871 2018-06-06 01:21:59 When most countries from the West treat Haiti like a child or a colony, Venezuela and Cuba have stood by Haiti. Venezuela provided oil to Haiti to keep its economy afloat. Haiti is just grateful to Venezuela. You need to worry about gun control in the U.S. The world is changing.

9882 2018-06-06 01:20:28 To be honest, the heavily subsidized ethanol industry has harmed Missouri consumers as much as big oil. My gas is a few cents cheaper, car goes fewer miles on a tank, and my taxes subsidize the industry doing it to me.

9895 2018-06-06 01:18:22 Well done!
9896 2018-06-06 01:18:14 Congress is not interested in removing him because: #ScottPruitt is a white republican.

Also? #ChikFilA is a known source of oil. Lotsa oil...

9899 2018-06-06 01:17:45 because @Maddow Pruitt is really an oil exec for putin/trump oil companies, the EPA job is ONLY to be able to travel around meeting people and getting rid of Envir protections! We pay his travel, salary, sound proof booth for oil deals! @GOP is corrupt as fahk!
9900 2018-06-06 01:17:44 This peppermint/lavender oil mix got me feeling toooooo good.

9902 2018-06-06 01:17:31 on a pan some oil or vegan butter, which is also oil  I just put whatever I have available, zucchini tomato, potatoes, onion, corn broccoli, beans, everything goes
9903 2018-06-06 01:17:29 So you admit to all the wrong doings in the oil pipeline project? Good.

9906 2018-06-06 01:17:08 My soliloquy, may be hard for some to swallow, but so is cod liver oil...
9907 2018-06-06 01:17:06 Agree with it all....

... EXCEPT the waffle fries. I used to love Chick-fil-A waffle fries until I got a large order where half the fries were still frozen and/or soggy with oil. 

NEVER WENT BACK. SOOOOOOO DISAPPOINTED.

9912 2018-06-06 01:16:28 No @GasBuddyDan hundreds of oil tankers DO NOT pass daily and the boats that do, are not loaded down with 650 000 barrels of toxic flammable sludge, through one of the most densely populated cities in North America. Coal spills are not the concern @GasBuddyDan , oil spills are!

9960 2018-06-06 01:10:00 Marijuana is NOT a narcotic. The only danger is the black market created by political & financial interests.

9979 2018-06-06 01:07:19 Have used pure sandalwood oil with success in treating depression. It also assists in the removal of negative programming from body cells thereby helping one to accept others with an open heart, while diminishing one’s own egocentricity.
9980 2018-06-06 01:07:12 JT just came to the realization that 99% of our oil is to the US and the huge risk we have by not accessing other markets.  Oh, and to the pipeline haters out there, would you prefer the oil to travel via road or rail? Oh, and oil helps funds the social programs we enjoy.

9989 2018-06-06 01:06:21 Wow. Did you get her permission for this? I have NEVER, by the way, heard that thing about 'covered in oil'. I only hope you didn't make it up just to go on your hate parade.

A) how do you plan on actually doing that?
B) who ends up paying for that? I have this weird hunch it won’t be oil companies.
C) what else might go wrong with that idea?
9993 2018-06-06 01:05:51 I also wonder if that faith in capitalism is a more modern mechanism. I can’t imagine there was a religious cult around Standard Oil or other 19th century capitalists. Then again I don’t know anything.

If we had imported same amount of crude oil (in BTU's) then LNG (in BTU's) in 2017, how much the importing cost would have been more?
10000 2018-06-06 01:04:21 Good map. These are pipelines regulated by the NEB, typically large trunk lines crossing interprovincial boundaries or into the US. Canada has the safest oil and gas industry in the world period. The AER is the best regulator in the world too and manage much more than the NEB.
