49 2018-04-23 23:23:04 Glad u don’t support shutting down free speech. I’d like to see bump stocks stopped and enforce current gun laws better. Elec college is genius. With pop vote, candidates could make wild promises to 3 metro areas and win on backs of rest of country. EC has candidates (1/2)

61 2018-04-23 23:13:51 While class actions against #AMP and #BXB may make some 'feel' better, at what point do investors in those stocks take responsibility for holding an inferior business? Risk is inherent in investing. Managing those risks makes for a successful investor. We can help @LIStockDoctor
62 2018-04-23 23:13:24 Sorry you lose' No mutuals or bonds. Picking the right stocks when they are at their low point is how you make money. Listening to leftist crybabies whining about how trickle down doesn't work is how you lose money.

74 2018-04-23 23:00:45 So what happened under Obama? Gun laws were actually lessened and bump stocks were approved.   So democrats have blood on their hands for not doing anything and siding with the NRA for 8 years under Obama.

81 2018-04-23 22:57:27 An AR 15 can be easily converted to fully Automatic with a bump stocks. It is a weapon like the AK 45 made to kill many people at once. With all due respect where would you use these for other than to kill in masses in verry little time?

91 2018-04-23 22:46:05 I'm all for stronger background checks, magazine restrictions, ban on bump stocks. Taking away assault rifles will never be enough for the left. It wouldn't solve the problem on gun violence because it doesn't address the problem.
92 2018-04-23 22:45:50 You’re right - imagine how bad those attacks would have been if the attackers had assault weapons with large capacity  magazines and bump stocks!

96 2018-04-23 22:41:20 Because of taxes earnings tomorrow morning for some stocks probably will be decent but likely same effect as $googl. Might be enough to hike market for at least morning tomorrow. After seeing $googl there’s no way bull market lasting imo. No way.
97 2018-04-23 22:41:00 On guns: McGrath says everything needs to be on the table. Specifically banning bump stocks, universal background checks and age restrictions. Thomas says we see gun violence every day, says we need waiting periods and the removal of military style weapons.

Agreed @markminervini
99 2018-04-23 22:35:30 What is this from, penny stocks?
100 2018-04-23 22:35:27 If stocks fall a la 2000 & 2007 then capital preservation will be the main driver of flow. Major risk off. Money will rotate into USTs and keep yields down. Fed rhetoric will also shift to dovish, further anchoring yields lower.
101 2018-04-23 22:35:24 I took 3 stocks without taking any damage. JV4. I swear I didn’t ask to be this sick!
102 2018-04-23 22:35:14 Have you tried investing in stocks from another country? I remember one of my friends moving here to america, setting up a stock, and coming back when it had gained a massive payout when he came from Australia
103 2018-04-23 22:35:01 You have bump stocks and hi cap mags. YOU'RE ILLEGAL YOU DUMB FUCK.
104 2018-04-23 22:33:32 Here you are saying "you come loaded with bump stocks and hi cap mags" both illegal!!! (mag cap depends on state). You hypocrite!

106 2018-04-23 22:30:04 Sell their stocks! Don't invest in their companies! Push for the industry to be regulated! Sad to say but it's the only way!  MAGA!

113 2018-04-23 22:23:00 I’m not familiar with bump stocks but it seems like a ridiculous ban.
114 2018-04-23 22:20:13 Also, data on service, weekly jobless claims, etc... The European Central Bank interest rate will be announced Thursday... On Friday, US stocks fell... The Dow fell 27.95 points... 0.82%,91.93... 24,462.94... Nasdaq: 1.27% 7,146.13...

116 2018-04-23 22:19:14 Markets generally were mixed o'nite with the tech stocks weaker, leading the Nasdaq 0.3% lower. Google reported stronger than expected quarterly numbers and was 2% higher in after- market trading. The ten year bonds hit a 4 year high of 2.99%.  A$ weakens to around US76c.
117 2018-04-23 22:19:05 Bingo bump stocks are gimmicks! Unreliable junk is all they are dnt own one wouldn’t either.

121 2018-04-23 22:13:53 Lately, I have been spending a considerable amount of time learning about trading large cap stocks. The penny market has its own niche, but I've been really interested. For those who have not taken the time to learn , go look into large caps. DM me for more info on a mentor
122 2018-04-23 22:13:09 Both of these things. Only one-uped by going in after luny on a "summer Friday" to an office that stocks beer.

127 2018-04-23 22:09:14 Not disagreeing with you. That's why I said investors need to listen to the non-FANG CC. They actually ARE really helpful to understanding where a company stands. FANG stocks have more analysts- usually limited to 1 question. Therefore, no follow-ups.

131 2018-04-23 22:05:44 @jimcramer is a clueless perma bull. Sure, you’ll make money listening to him when interest rates are suppressed at zero and stocks have no choice but to melt up. Anyone listening to him now when the Fed is ready to reverse course is a sheep and will get slaughtered. #QE #ZIRP

135 2018-04-23 22:02:50 The point was the stocks not the transaction.  Stores restock and carry more of a popular product versus a product that doesn't sell. Though I do hope this problem gets fixed, there are wayyyyyy more deserving people who would love a BTS album but don't have the means.

143 2018-04-23 21:57:47 It would be a good idea if it worked. Most companies will keep it by back stocks, they won't trickle it down or make new jobs. It will become bonus money for them. Trickle down doesn't work. It is plainly gift of money for people who didn't pay tax in the first place

146 2018-04-23 21:53:30 Again, NRA, Hillary lost.  Trump won.  Is there any way for you to be positive about anything?  How about a positive legislative platform to ban bump stocks, ban high capacity mags, waiting periods, etc.  look forward, not back and unstick the NRA wagon from its rut.
147 2018-04-23 21:51:18 Honestly I was nervous about buying a house, investing in stocks and my retirement until I took this finance class. It's not even scary. But it's actually really sad that America is so financially illiterate it relys heavily on credit.

156 2018-04-23 21:45:10 If the “ineffective laws” aren’t enforced though, what’s to say your “actual laws” will be? By banning a gun that looks military? The exact same rifle with brown wooden stocks will be legal under your proposition.

158 2018-04-23 21:44:11 Stocks are medium to high risk, with higher returns than other investments b/c they’re long-term investments & meant to gain value over time but are bought and sold anytime #lidyoffisthebest

180 2018-04-23 21:26:18 Competition. The deck is stacked to very wealthy & multinationals don't need to compete, they stockpile offshore and buyback stocks.
181 2018-04-23 21:25:40 The NRA is still about sensible gun ownership. Did you know that they are against the bump stocks like the one used in Las Vegas? While Obama's admin let the patent go through, the NRA was denouncing this product. The NRA does teaches more about gun safety than any DC law will.
182 2018-04-23 21:25:26 micro? HaaS  should pertain to Frank and consigne better conditions of willing as bitcoin to use neutrally as part of those ghosips at stocks.
183 2018-04-23 21:24:36 It’s too easy to get caught up in chop when stocks are mean reverting. The trick is to try and catch trends, but it’s easier said than done. Unless you’re willing to constantly be switching between long, flat, and short positions, it’s probably best to stay out all together.
184 2018-04-23 21:23:30 And then there's the even more obvious good where investors who sell their stocks to the company buying them back will have $$$ they can park elsewhere.

Cheers! This was eye opening, especially for a pinko liberal like me.
185 2018-04-23 21:22:55 That's ridiculous.  Most can be traced to a porous border, same place drugs come from.  At least 2000 can be traced to Barack Obama who sold them to drug cartels (Fast and Furious)  before he approved bump stocks against the NRA's advice.  Don't forget about the Promise Program.

231 2018-04-23 20:55:24 They probably argue that small brokers would save money on connections, etc.   To be true, they would need to show that brokers with significant share in these stocks don't trade large cap stocks.

235 2018-04-23 20:52:09 Late 1990’s dot-com stocks and mid-2000’s mortgage-backed securities at least theoretically represented ownership of a real world asset with an income stream, with legal protections that existed but turned out to be inadequate in retrospect.

256 2018-04-23 20:38:45 Good post! I’d put some emphasis on the general lack of interest in the share as well. But compared w other Li stocks, we’ve been better off. Good buying today mate!
257 2018-04-23 20:36:37 It's the trend that is concerning.  A lot of stocks selling off after good earnings reports this season.
258 2018-04-23 20:36:33 It’s like stocks! Unless it’s in a retirement vehicle, you must pay taxes on the gains. You aren’t double taxed because your post-tax income you invest becomes your cost basis.

270 2018-04-23 20:30:19 that's why PTA pushed the film stock in Phantom Thread and why it's so grainy in the end. The film stocks are now too good that you have to mess them up.

272 2018-04-23 20:30:02 Mock if you wish. Sales of bump stocks are an infinitesimal fraction of gun-related accessories. Banning them wouldn't stop a determined killer.

283 2018-04-23 20:21:06 World stocks flat to mixed: US flat; Europe +.4%. Rising interest-rates causing some concern for investors in both stocks & bonds. If 10-year note moves into 3+% range could start bear market in bonds & as it moves higher provide competition for stocks. That would limit upside.
284 2018-04-23 20:19:52 Very true. Ultimately if we plan our downside risk in advance then we don't need to worry about market crashes as individual stops will take us out the market. Timing stocks is great to an extent - but one example is #FEVR where it looked expensive but in hindsight very cheap.

375 2018-04-23 19:38:26 Some of my biggest gains were made in sideways markets.

Not trying to be mean but, damn. It's painfully obvious you know nothing about what you feel so passionate about.

522 2018-04-23 18:26:24 I think the majority of jurno do a good job to the public, explaining the importance of savings, diversifying and low cost investments, use of tax breaks.

But from time to time they get in trouble when they try to outsmart others, like Paul’s cash deposits comparison v FTSE 100!
523 2018-04-23 18:26:21 Ok, we are still on the same page. This is good stuff. Now, what about bump stocks and similar devices aimed at circumventing existing laws against automatic weapons? Surely you agree there is no reason not to make those illegal
524 2018-04-23 18:25:55 $FRFS looks like it was temporarily  out! i see it's working again now!
525 2018-04-23 18:24:53 .@larry_kudlow wtf larry -- say something about stocks
526 2018-04-23 18:24:44 You think so? I never thought about it like that. I might give some a try in my paper trading account. My hubby took to shorting naturally this year. I don't even watch stocks that fall below VWAP.
527 2018-04-23 18:23:39 There are four portfolio strategies :-

1. Concentrated - 3-7 stocks
2. Focused - 8-15 stocks
3. Diversified - > 16 stocks

and finally

4. Stupidity - 1-2 stocks
528 2018-04-23 18:23:05 All want to buy low and sell high but very few have the nerve to buy unloved stocks and watch them remain unloved for 3 years before market starts loving them again

541 2018-04-23 18:11:22 I don't take investment advise from nonexperts on Twitter or message boards, especially when the platforms are permeaded with people who have bets against (shorted) the stocks. The company has already hired lawyers, accountants, and experts to address these issues.

543 2018-04-23 18:11:10 Regulate bump stocks is something i can agree with. 100 round magazines are a bit silly, but a rare novelty item for the majority of gun owners. It has a use, but mostly for fun and war. Which the people are entitled to the use of such according to Hamilton, Mason, Madison, Jay
544 2018-04-23 18:11:04 This downward selling pressure on many popular stocks over the last 4-5 sesions has all been orchrestrated by the large trading firms $QQQ $SPY $IWM $EEM $DIA creating huge losses for traders (but profits for the firms)

551 2018-04-23 18:06:53 When I say aggravating I am talking about laws that are vague. Here in MD you can legally purchase an AR (believe it or not) but only certain model numbers or as a pistol or with certain stocks etc..the way the laws are written 
552 2018-04-23 18:06:50 Who said I was anti gun? I never said that. I want the killing to stop. That's it. If that happens with everyone owning a gaggle of rifles I am totally ok with that. But that is not the reality we live in. We need common sense gun laws. Ban 100 round magazines, Ban bump stocks.

557 2018-04-23 18:01:33 Definitely not panicking. just odd that the blockchain stocks don't correlate with BTC, like they normally do. Probably just a Canadian thing. Anyways, good chance for those to get in cheap. I picked up more $cybx at 45c.

629 2018-04-23 17:54:34 A lot of people like to call themselves value investors, but get so easily scared of beaten down stocks. Foot Locker is a good example. Sure, there are lots of problems but that's why there's a value premium.

636 2018-04-23 17:52:35 Diversify in stocks and bonds. Balance is a well diversified portfolio’s resistance to volatility. An investor is like a high wire act, you must balance, using research to be successful. Stocks, Bonds (by age so take 100-age=% of Stocks/Bonds). At age 25, 75% Stocks 25% Bonds.

742 2018-04-23 17:39:38 How surprising that a willingness to sell US stocks were worst performers in global….
743 2018-04-23 17:37:28 I think too that just because a commodity is selling at way below its cost of production, doesn’t mean it will go to stratospheric heights in the short run.. Uranium could easily double from here which could cause the stocks to rise 200 to 300%. That’s a pretty good return.
744 2018-04-23 17:36:43 e.g. if we still “require” a 6% return, but stocks and bond returns are forecasted lower, then a high static allocation to bonds can make that goal unreachable, whereas in higher interest rate environments it was not.

746 2018-04-23 17:36:12 Canadian crypto stocks finally had a good bounce on Friday and crypto stayed strong over the weekend so these stocks must be doing well today, right? Lol, no. Fuk'n Canada, no wonder this is one of the worst performing markets this year, littered with sellers who are never done.
747 2018-04-23 17:36:07 If we assume the relative return spread between stocks and bonds is the same, the opportunity cost can still be “higher” if we don’t lower our return expectations.

I don't expect the FED to be silly and raise ST rates as much as markets thinks..  so I also don't expect 10y to go well beyond 3%..  but if it would, that would be bad for stocks..

867 2018-04-23 17:01:07 There are many styles of investing-
- Special situations 
- Cyclicals
- Turn arounds
- Compounders
You CAN NOT make money in all. Practice one or two & master it. 
Keep it simple! Ours is special situations and compounding #stocks #StockMarket

871 2018-04-23 16:59:42 Interesting. I was not aware of the stock market back then. I have been aggressively investing since Q4 2017. My stocks all get along, and I enjoy talking about stocks more and more.

874 2018-04-23 16:58:44 I get the principal. Higher bond yields = bonds are more attractive relative to stocks. But honestly. 3%?!? It's three percent. Not ten, not eight, not five. Three percent. I know nothing, but I have confidence in my ability to earn more than 3%.

878 2018-04-23 16:56:52 Well if i.e. 10 year bond yields go much higher, bonds would be more competition for stocks. I.e. the equity risk premium would go down if stock prices were able to stay at prevailing levels and companies can't rise their earnings substantially.

880 2018-04-23 16:56:27 hm, thought about it ... maybe the corgis chose an abandonned cookie-factory as their lair? And so there are enough stocks ...
881 2018-04-23 16:55:30 ......thanks to an 8-month surplus of last year's stocks, but it should reduce the scope of that surplus in the coming year.
882 2018-04-23 16:55:29 We don't need to win over extremists people that support the NRA's gun-sales rhetoric. We can ban assault rifles, bump stocks & large clips AND get reliable background check systems in place if we can replace NRA-owned lawmakers that block changes even most NRA members support.

886 2018-04-23 16:52:40 The opportunity cost is more about the spread in expected return than the level.  Still a health spread in most assumptions between stocks and bonds.
887 2018-04-23 16:52:25 Some New Traders need to understand that now that BMIC is gone, no need to 1 tick flip- Let the stocks run
888 2018-04-23 16:52:23 Strange day, good earnings and macro,VIX down, USD/JPY rallied nearly 1% and stocks still down, something else happening below the surface, it is probably hanging on quantitative tightening and rates.
889 2018-04-23 16:51:03 This is where you lose me @davidhogg111 ....... I’m with you on military style weapons,bump stocks and big capacity magazines.But calling for boycotts of investment co’s for having holdings in gun manufacturers?Did I miss something or is your goal now the elimination of ALL guns?
890 2018-04-23 16:50:41 I feel it has already peaked, fall alrdy started. No target achieved this March. Poor feedback recd by shopkeepers.

895 2018-04-23 16:49:40 "Near full automatic", what does that even mean? Like bump stocks? A few seconds on Google disproves that.

Again, I ask, what is the real difference, other than fact that the AR-15 has been fetishised by anti-gun crowd into an evil talisman that corrupts by its very existence.

902 2018-04-23 16:46:43 No, b/c I do not accept the term "assault weapon" exists officially outside the left wing, gun grabbing, anti-2nd Amendment community and those they are trying to dupe. It's based on cosmetic features like pistol grips, retractable stocks, barrel shrouds & flash suppressors.

1019 2018-04-23 16:32:59 that is a very good point in deed. maybe growth is sustainable with these rates.. the problem for me..I am waiting for rates to tick up a little higher to move into 2 and 5 years. I am waiting to get a better yield and I think a lot of other people are too. so less $ into stocks
1020 2018-04-23 16:32:06 Once again, more uninformed tweets out there. The question should be posed differently. Is 3% in an aging bull market with stocks reacting negatively on yield rise (fact) and in a correction phase, competition and shelter? Mortgages, gas prices etc.. moving up at the wrong time.

1184 2018-04-23 15:54:03 I was thinking about the same thing the other day. It’s opened up different types of investment opportunities that are more relatable - plus the tokens / cryptoassets hold a somewhat different value to the traditional stocks and equity markets

1186 2018-04-23 15:53:22 stocks don’t need to collapse for metals to go higher. too many still calling for stocks to collapse, so expect the opposite for summer
1187 2018-04-23 15:52:51 Bump stocks are a module you swap out the standard stock for to allow an automatic rate of fire
1188 2018-04-23 15:52:06 We are approaching summer time let's see where the MJ stocks are heading... Volume has been drying up one thing to notice... Sector has dropped between 40 to 80 perc....is the bottom in?

1195 2018-04-23 15:46:55 No they aren't. They are trading it as an asset. What do you think the volume of stocks traded in the last 24hrs is? And the US$ value of those stocks? Considerably higher than BTC, I would suggest. Does that make stocks a medium of exchange? No, it does not.
1196 2018-04-23 15:46:47 Yet, more people are working and drawing higher wages. GDP is up over 3%, something Obama could not do. Stocks are up. NorKor is negotiating and ceasing missle and nuclear development. And you are worried about his innocent white lies? Grow up!

1215 2018-04-23 15:39:39 In my trading world a penny up/down means $10 up/down (in the bank account), ten cents means $100 and a dollar means $1,000!

So I must be careful when buying/selling stocks that move up/down a lot.

1307 2018-04-23 14:53:02 Big techs slowly grinding up with $GOOGL regaining the 50d MA in undecisive market action so far. $SNAP $MYOK $OKTA $SAIL doing well. However I am looking to bank profits into any quick upside action to put myself in a strong position for the rest of the week. #stocks

1321 2018-04-23 14:46:56 Buying stocks would be a terrible way to "gain exposure to Russia's sovereign debt", right?
1322 2018-04-23 14:46:50 Hey Jim. NTRI really isn't squeezing. It is tightening up below $30, but it's not something I'd trade.  Too much supply due to its downtrend. The better squeeze trades are in stocks close to their highs rather than lows, like $WTW.
1323 2018-04-23 14:46:46 True... But may be there is a way to short stocks which are very weak... But have high momentum... To go short... Sugar, OMCs, PSUbanks have been weak for long time..
1324 2018-04-23 14:45:38 Market seems to be in the mood for a crash.  High volatility and interest rate increases usually mean trouble ahead.  I'm out of stocks.

1326 2018-04-23 14:45:16 That’s two points. Go re-watch Bledsoe not rotating on defense. Watch Snell not playing hard on D. Go watch The Bucks blow a 4 on 1 without even getting a shot off. They were very good for 3 quarters and then they settled. The officiating looks bad when you change the way it play
1327 2018-04-23 14:43:38 Hi Poppy, this was just while stocks lasted. We're sorry for any disappointment caused!

1336 2018-04-23 14:42:07 You can adjust if the bad calls are consistent. Not if there are blatantly missed bad calls. Like a jersey grab on a fast break. And yes snell could’ve dumped it sooner for an easy 2 points.

These measures will save more lives than the things we're arguing over so let's call a truce & get them passed.

1348 2018-04-23 14:37:45 I understand your frustration. But you aren’t looking at the big picture. Social media gets people famous over night, people’s opinions on social media can effect multimillion dollar stocks. So granted it can’t help you in the moment and get you out of jail, people know

1360 2018-04-23 14:34:36 The thing that kills stocks is higher long-term real interest rates, not inflation expectations. The main reason for this is that when inflation rises, usually earnings do also, at least at cyclical companies. But there is no reason why earnings should rise when real rates rise.

1366 2018-04-23 14:31:37 I thought that practice was banned or at least limited after the Enron meltdown The amount of my company's stock that I could hold in my 401k was definitely limited Investing in stocks is inherently risky. Not investing is a guaranteed way of losing money
1367 2018-04-23 14:31:07 Impressive quarterly results and increased USDINR lifted Tech stocks. 

NIIT Tech gained 4% to close at Rs1036 while it has touched a day's high of Rs1088. 

TCS gained marginally to close at Rs3408 while it has touched a day's low of Rs3558.
1368 2018-04-23 14:30:36 I feel the problem is that pro-gunners deny the existence in the effectiveness of preventative measures. It took 58 people being mowed down in Las Vegas for bump stocks to be banned. If those stocks were banned beforehand, Paddock probably wouldn't have been able to kill 58.
1369 2018-04-23 14:30:34 The penalty on stocks like Rusal was ILLEGAL, cause small investors own its shares and deserve remedy.

No, the party of the year.
1392 2018-04-23 14:18:23 2. Banks outperform but stocks drop
Many of the major banks have released their reports and most beat projections for earnings and revenues.  Despite this positive news; however, their stocks experienced declines.

1408 2018-04-23 14:08:59 I agree.  Stocks do very well with a flattening yield curve.  But they do better with a steep one.  I think too many are anticipating higher rates faster.  We could see inflation moderate and the Fed go neutral.  A scenario few are anticipating

1438 2018-04-23 14:00:00 When you see someone on TV asked what % investors should put in stocks, know that their answer is completely useless. As to what % you should hold in stocks should be based on your specific personal financial situation, not based on some broad answer given by a TV talking head.
1439 2018-04-23 13:59:59 Yea long term you don't have much to worry about as long as they are quality stocks. A loss isn't actually a loss until you cash that puppy out by selling. You'll be green in the long run

1459 2018-04-23 13:49:36 Well, you have been saying sell the stock repeatedly. Why anyone would sell stocks here is mystifying
1460 2018-04-23 13:49:35 If, on the other hand, new coins are required and The Royal Mint holds stocks of previous years' dated coins then these are placed into general circulation before the current year dated coins are released.(3/3)
1461 2018-04-23 13:49:08 If demand for a particular denomination can be met from stocks of coins held within the banking sector, then the banks will not need to draw new coins from The Royal Mint. (2/3)
1462 2018-04-23 13:48:05 Such a big surprise that a conservative personality would invest. I know I buy precious metals, stocks and bonds. Maybe I should be investigated as well.
1463 2018-04-23 13:47:57 Every public statement by dana loesch, marion hammer & wayne lapierre  containing the words gun, weapon or 2nd Am is a push for more guns in more ppls hands. We don't need what they're selling (bump stocks, assault weapons, ETC.)

1689 2018-04-23 11:56:44 What doesn’t add up is US equity charts are wildly bullish: cup and handle Spoos, inverse head and shoulders RSL.  There is a false signal here somewhere.  No way stocks go up if USD and rates are breaking out higher.  That’s why $ price action key today.

2289 2018-04-23 02:48:25 Trump, his politics and his fans/supporters are hugely popular laughing stocks over here in all the scandinavian countries. And those wondering why can just google "the scandinavian/nordic/norwegian model", it'll probably explain quite a lot about the reason why it's so.
2290 2018-04-23 02:46:59 The are people who, with one simple tweet could cause stocks to either soar or drop dramatically. While your words may not be able to make a CEO nervous, there's still life and death in the power of your tongue.
2291 2018-04-23 02:46:18 Day 1 of my first job, my manager told me this: Never own too much of the company stocks. If the company sinks, you will lose your paycheck and your savings too. Tremendous common sense, in hindsight.
2292 2018-04-23 02:45:15 I need to start investing in stocks 
2293 2018-04-23 02:43:31 When the press answers for deliberately blacking out coverage of @SenSanders' campaign, you'll get your turn at the stocks for how "unfairly" they treated Queen Hillary by reporting on information demonstrating her malfeasance.  Until then, cry us a friggin' river.

2303 2018-04-23 02:30:27 That these larger guns are often the weapons of choice when assholes want to kill a lot of people. They often (although apparently not this time) choose to add high capacity magazines so they don't have to reload and bump stocks so they can increase the number of times it fires.
2304 2018-04-23 02:30:21 You hypocritical, money grubbing liar. Most of the companies are taking their tax money and buying back their stocks. They own more of their companies. It didn't go to the employees. It's call GREED. Congress or the president does not care about the ordinary citizen.

2323 2018-04-23 02:04:15 Asian stocks had a mixed start Monday, with investors continuing to  assess the outlook for trade discussions and geopolitical tensions.  Equity benchmarks rose in Sydney, while those in Tokyo and Seoul were  little changed.
2324 2018-04-23 02:00:33 What does it mean, there is lot of up side in other it stocks, sell TCS, long other it ...?
2325 2018-04-23 01:58:12 Agreed mid cap options are golden, way better than penny stocks. And I’ll try just out the money.
2326 2018-04-23 01:57:24 Actually, a50 round mag, not a clip is available. Bump stocks would put half the rounds in the ceiling. And would you be willing to get hit with 230 grans of lead?

2332 2018-04-23 01:47:16 I need to invest in some stocks.
2333 2018-04-23 01:46:12 Great point. You are clearly a gifted researcher of biotech stocks and should be shorting every single share you can put your scrawny hands on. PLEASE tell us you're doing more here than just flapping your lip. Put your $ where your mouth is. I have. Or STFU
2334 2018-04-23 01:45:49 People will do illegal things. That doesn't mean we shouldn't have laws and regulations.

2348 2018-04-23 01:29:35 Now this is a real issue about wealth inequality. While the 1% plays with stocks and luxury items, that's fine. When they start messing with real estate and inflating housing values, that effects every American. We need far more progressive taxation to prevent inflation.

2361 2018-04-23 01:16:34 Let's ban bump stocks, ban high capacity magazines, and ban assault rifles. There's no constitutional protection for ANY of those things, and if the framers of the constitution saw what a paranoid, gun-loving society America had become, they'd be absolutely disgusted.
2362 2018-04-23 01:15:03 Steps to execute a stress free trade:

1. Research
2. Narrow watchlist to 10-15 focus stocks
3. Create plan for each trade defining position size, risk, reward & entry trigger
4. Enter on trigger
5. Set stops & targets
6. Set it & forget it (do not micro-manage)
7. Rinse & repeat
