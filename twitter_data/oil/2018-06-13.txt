43 2018-06-13 23:56:46 in high school we used to throw chips in there because all the oil makes it flare up

51 2018-06-13 23:55:59 lmao my dad painted my living room ceiling with oil based paint and my house is only 1000 sq ft I'm pretty sure my mom and I are high right now based on our inability to hold a normal conversation
52 2018-06-13 23:55:44 Well since the Lieberals took office it’s been a steady dismissal of the west a steady attack on the oil and coal industries! Leave it in the ground? Ship it through the States then back east? Absurd to say the least! Irving oil said they wouldn’t accept Western oil!#owntankers!
53 2018-06-13 23:55:43 Lol. That is why it is to our benefit to diversify our energy sources by investing in renewable energy. I don't use any oil any more do I could care less what the price of oil is. Solar provides all of the energy I consume.
54 2018-06-13 23:55:38 The oil my and horrid fiscal policies my dear.
55 2018-06-13 23:55:35 “For people like me, this has been an extraordinarily satisfying year & a half": taxes cuts, deregulation, judicial appointments &opening up the Alaskan Wildlife Refuge for oil drilling.“On those issues,” McConnell said, “we couldn’t have asked for a better partner” than Trump.
56 2018-06-13 23:55:18 Total number probably less.
There a lot of chickens, but we displaced something like 75% of wild land biomass. (The human and human-friend share is higher still, but that's because we convert oil and potash into plants.)
57 2018-06-13 23:55:11 Us doesn’t get oil from Iran google it ! Open your eyes you can’t hate America that bad my god .
58 2018-06-13 23:55:06 Good that Oil Prices are high because it gives an incentive for both consumers and car manufacturers to buy/build more fuel efficient cars!
59 2018-06-13 23:55:06 We finally had a President that literally said war or peace and hit them with hard sanctions to include oil. Then went to China and got the to back it up and go alone with us. Then in response to the firing a test ICBM we fired one of ours. That Titian missile hit its target

So this oil, being an expert what was the PBOE cost in say 2014 as opposed to now?
63 2018-06-13 23:54:38 Remember when people on the right blamed obama - not OPEC - for high oil prices.  They seem awfully quiet right now.
64 2018-06-13 23:54:37 We need to tap him for oil.
65 2018-06-13 23:54:23 True I'm in Albarta so they hate us more than Trump.  Most our export to you is oil so we'll ride this out. 

Eastern Canada is about to wake up to a nightmare they created.
It's like watching a slow motion train wreck.
66 2018-06-13 23:54:08 "ancient Greece wasn't gay and wouldn't support homosexuals"
Lmao one of the reasons olive oil was popular in Greece was bc the men has so much gay anal sex.
67 2018-06-13 23:53:35 The irony is this. The higher oil prices go the more capital will be put into renewable sources. The electric car will ultimately happen once battery technology improves. It’s not a matter of “IF” it’s just “WHEN” it happens.
68 2018-06-13 23:53:30 Agar stab in dram vial in minimal media agar, (or SWYE if a marine vibrio), then overlay with sterile mineral oil. Cap tightly. Store in dark at room temp. I'd check on it after a few months.

82 2018-06-13 23:51:54 Way to go President Trump . It's great to know you see how much the price of a barrel of oil affects  the world economy . Everything is going great why slow it down .
83 2018-06-13 23:51:46 use coconut oil when you go to sleepy. it will help keep your skin hydrated and helps with repair while you sleep. if you have acne, use a little moisturizer to decrease the amount of oil.

86 2018-06-13 23:51:34 Currently using the hydrating eye cream and cleanser. Also use the scar gel and and the argan oil blend for my cuticles. Would recommend all of them!
87 2018-06-13 23:51:32 It’s funny because from what I could see they were just giving it to super corrupt countries and outdoing themselves each time

2014 Russeff so corrupt she was impeached
2018 Putins Russia
2022 Qatar(oil bribes)

89 2018-06-13 23:50:46 pasta (any kind- ziti to gnocchi) with olive oil or butter (depending on what is on hand) and parmesan. Been this way since I was 4 or 5. (Adulthood ushered in the occasional addition of freshly cracked black pepper.)

91 2018-06-13 23:50:44 I've burnt myself a couple of times on this oil heater.

92 2018-06-13 23:50:31 I got the clear case on amazon because I heard the Switch was a finger oil magnet, and the grips can be found on Nintendo’s website! :)

99 2018-06-13 23:49:51 Got results from my annual physical today. Blood, urine, the whole raccoon. 100 percent healthy, like an 18-year-old. The only thing I used to have was 200 cholesterol. But I quit meat, spray olive oil on my popcorn, exercise daily, and it plummeted. I am ... a perfect being.

119 2018-06-13 23:48:34 Not only do we share the same name but also the same pastime  Word. Pass the coconut oil.
120 2018-06-13 23:48:27 Since Alberta oil is as GHG-intensive as just about any other, and moreso than leading candidates for marginal producer globally (middle east, Texas Permian), i can't see a CO2 increase. Further, point of my paper is that decrease supply equals decreased consumption (not 1 for 1)
121 2018-06-13 23:48:13 We are mightily to blame for that along with the Brits.  I've read alot of contemporaneous history.  Suggest reading, "House of Saud"  I have other recommendations but the mess in the middle east is essentially our fault.  We just can't seem to leave them alone...too much oil.
122 2018-06-13 23:48:11 What are we going to do when Saudi  oil wells run dry????? Reasonable regulations and taxes as well as liabilities from the drillers are the way to go!
123 2018-06-13 23:47:36 Thank you Mr. President for acknowledging the big problem many of us hardworking Americans are facing at the gas pump. Since the Hurricane Harvey last year our hard earned money and tax breaks are going to the big wigs in the oil industry.

145 2018-06-13 23:45:22 いい仕事ないですかー
146 2018-06-13 23:45:17 So what are you going to do about it? Hike them up higher for your greedy oil friends?! 
147 2018-06-13 23:45:09 Idk why they sell the tuna in a can in oil. Like who tf be buying that?
148 2018-06-13 23:45:06 Konting cooking oil nalang talaga at maybe – just maybe, I'll start to love frying.
149 2018-06-13 23:44:55 He's just trying to take some of the oil off the lane..

151 2018-06-13 23:44:51 How soon can the Alberta NDP start supply-managing our oil so that all the Federal parties will start falling all over each other to protect the industry? #cdnpoli #abpoli
152 2018-06-13 23:44:49 All these old car will be useless in coming yrs, we get all our petrol from Singapore, we dont refine anymore. so seeing EV's are going to be taken up real fast in Singapore due to its size & reliance on others for oil, when they close their refinery where do you get it?
153 2018-06-13 23:44:36 Ya too bad we export most of our oilsands oil to the US. Looks like you're helping hospitals in Montana.
154 2018-06-13 23:44:30 After talking some of the comments, my mind is boggled. What would happen if we shut off all the oil taps going to the south?
155 2018-06-13 23:44:29 WHY drop bIofuels? ! ! ! ? Drop palm oil, corn oil, THERE'S MANY sources for biofuels! You sound like you're bought and sold by Big Oil.
156 2018-06-13 23:44:21 k let me go get some knee oil
157 2018-06-13 23:44:21 Our territorial waters which possess bounty fish products and oil & gas potentials can't be replaced by noodles and cigarettes.

158 2018-06-13 23:44:10 Indeed I'm sure you do. That's a start, some really small countries in the full list eh,some with that useless oil stuff too, odd that. Scotland's isn't in the way Englands is actually, it's not broad based enough yes,that's 1 of the points of investment. Multipliers, GDP growth?
159 2018-06-13 23:43:55 Dad: “did you shut the engine off before pouring the oil in?”
Me: “nope, felt like today would be a good day to blow up”

162 2018-06-13 23:43:03 don’t really understand why accts on here are so up about transparent horny billionaire elon who just wants to go to space and shits a little bit on his employees when like, oil companies still exist. non-renewable energy companies are fucking us and our planet hard
163 2018-06-13 23:42:59 2 words

Olive oil
164 2018-06-13 23:42:48 The problem with oilsands oil, well just ask the understated spill data as to what is the risk. Or the downstream effects on communities, many of them first Nations. Because of this, we should be careful about labelling things ethical or unethical.
165 2018-06-13 23:42:47 Okay so ppl say they cover their body in coconut oil and I’m like how..... like idk if I could deal w being so oily. I’m being serious. So if y’all use a special kind or something LMK I WANT SOFT SKIN 25/8
166 2018-06-13 23:42:44 The earth will never run out of oil, so why do we pay for gas ? Who tf woke up one day and said “hmm ,im going to claim this oil, that came from the earth, which came from God, lemme charge people for it.”
167 2018-06-13 23:42:43 Does your CBD oil contain THC???
168 2018-06-13 23:42:38 i need medical marijuana, cbd oil.
for post chemotherapy pain.
169 2018-06-13 23:42:35 2/How do you respond to the argument that if Alberta oil sands production is capped or reduced by any amount, other heavy crude oil producers (with even more carbon-intense oil) will simply back fill Alberta supply, creating a net negative for global CO2 levels?
170 2018-06-13 23:42:25 My sister was cooking mac and cheese and we don't have butter so she substituted it with olive oil
171 2018-06-13 23:42:07 US farmers getting subsidized in all different ways, Canadian farmers will disappear, if we let the US do away with our system . I believe we should start free trade within Canada , that would help , oil free flowing etc.
172 2018-06-13 23:42:02 Health is taking your fish oil pill, but chasing it with wine 
173 2018-06-13 23:41:58 Except they need a rebuild every oil change LOL
174 2018-06-13 23:41:38 *looks left & right*
<whisper>
there be a shitton of diesel fuel oil in avocado fields

175 2018-06-13 23:41:24 Which country visits America the most? Canada! You make over 1 1/2 billion US dollars just from us vacationing there every year. Guess we'll travel else where now! You guys buy our oil, natural gas, soft wood, electricity...etc. Don't think you don't need us!
176 2018-06-13 23:41:19 Well, you see, Canada actually imports a lot of oil. Some of it comes from these unethical places you speak about, and a larger part of it comes from places like the US, Russia, Algeria, Angola, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela etc...
177 2018-06-13 23:41:14 Hmm, let’s make it simple. If you do anything that results in instability in the Middle East, OIL PRICES RISE.. There, wasn’t that easy? YOU ARE TO BLAME. Basically scaring the whole world - very destabilizing. #WorstPresidentEver
178 2018-06-13 23:41:09 Because in exchange for Saudi Arabia trading oil on the U.S. dollar, we are their hired mercenaries. Same thing in Syria where S.A. wants to build a pipeline to Turkey. This would cut Russia out of the deal but I'm sure that has zero to do with all the McCarthyism we're seeing 
179 2018-06-13 23:40:40 1/I saw the 400 kg in the press release, just wanted to confirm that it was applied to all oil sands production. Thank you.
180 2018-06-13 23:40:26 CBD oil is becoming a staple in the average American household. Instead of reaching for the aspirin or xanex. Give CBD oil a try! Take a look at the seemingly endless products available through CTFO together we can change the future.
181 2018-06-13 23:40:15 君を笑わせるためなら、僕は尻から油を出すよ。
182 2018-06-13 23:40:14 Hey essential oil lovers, what oil, product or symptoms do you want to learn about? I’m going live with your suggestions tomorrow.
183 2018-06-13 23:40:07 Meanwhile US is sucking up the natural resources up as fast as it can More than just oil in those countries. 
Cobalt and Lithium. Drugs? Yes, I believe our government over sees some of that action, they getting cut in some form.
184 2018-06-13 23:39:55 Knock them down a peg, oil companies been price gouging long enough.
185 2018-06-13 23:39:51 ...to reduce a global glut of oil. The deal, which is due 2 run out at end of 2018, Iran told u that sanctions on 2 OPEC founding members & still blame OPEC for oil price volatility (Iran & Venezuela). Donnie, it's yr fault prices r skyrocketing. #WorstPresidentEver
186 2018-06-13 23:39:28 Mixing body oil and body butter is key
187 2018-06-13 23:39:26 Put a 25% tariff on imported oil.  Heck, your supporters can even afford 50%. That'll teach em.
188 2018-06-13 23:39:23 For my dry scalp i started putting black Jamaican castor oil on my scalp once a week. Helps it grow but the dry scalp disappeared.
189 2018-06-13 23:39:17 #Canabis oil! BANNED IN UK.BUT LEGAL IN MANY OTHER COUNTRIES! AND LOTS OF GREEDY TORIES HAVE FINGERS IN THE PIE! SELF INTERESTS ONLY IN GOVT
190 2018-06-13 23:39:10 My friend are all working again. On the dakota's. Full time they were laid off under Obama. Matter of fact all this oil is being sold and trillions are coming to America. Not going overseas
191 2018-06-13 23:39:04 Tf these people think olive oil was used for
192 2018-06-13 23:38:57 I can relate!!! Peppermint oil helps me and tea. And whiskey #anxietyisreal #anxietysucks
193 2018-06-13 23:38:55 Yep - looks like fresh oil to me. Make their ass fix their mistaje. Probably not a huge issue, though.
194 2018-06-13 23:38:55 Any possibility  that Trump's sanctions to block Iran oil are causing increased prices? Of course supply demand determines price and decreased oil means increased price. We need to remember that Trump tariffs and sanctions are increasing our costs.
195 2018-06-13 23:38:54 Maybe it has something to do with the Iran sanctions you imposed in order to reduce their output, raise oil prices, and benefit your masters in Russia?  Hmmm?
196 2018-06-13 23:38:51 Bowling alley mechanic. Certified Brunswick. Fun, but dirty job. The combination of lane oil and cigarette smoke  smells like pot (friend smoked a lot). My mom thought I was a pothead every time I’d come home from work.
197 2018-06-13 23:38:45 Um....you are responsible for sending oil prices through the roof. You canceled the Iran nuclear agreement.
198 2018-06-13 23:38:41 I can’t even use peppermint oil I’m allergic 
199 2018-06-13 23:38:35 @PressSec One reason Trump can't repeal biofuel regulations during his first term is because he would get slaughtered in the Iowa Caucuses and the MSM would try to turn it into a Domino Effect. But... open ANWAR, complete Keystone, incentivize oil rigs to return to the Gulf.
200 2018-06-13 23:38:35 Absolutely.  I’ve seen the benefits of this. I work with a few children whose seizures in the past have been heartbreaking to watch.  They’ve been on “oil” and the seizures have decreased significantly.

204 2018-06-13 23:37:46 Don't let your hair get into your face while you sleep. The oil from your hair can cause acne.
205 2018-06-13 23:37:39 I have the oil of Increase on me!
206 2018-06-13 23:37:25 Hey dumb ass gad prices went up as a direct result of you  backing out of the Iran deal..Russia benefits and im so sure you have a financial interest in oil prices being up
207 2018-06-13 23:37:20 Massage using Magnesium Oil spray works well for muscle spasms and tendonitis. Vitamin D3 and Iodine deficiencies often contribute to my fibromyalgia pain. Vitamin B Complex helps with nerve pain. 

Most other things that I'm aware of have been mentioned already.

212 2018-06-13 23:36:27 Coconut Oil is legit. Hope you get feeling better soon.
213 2018-06-13 23:36:23 Yet Americans don't believe in climate change. If climate change had oil they would have definitely tried to "liberate it "
214 2018-06-13 23:36:15 I don’t watch the programme. But by the look of the picture it looks like his face has been smothered in Baby oil! Very good for the skin!
215 2018-06-13 23:36:13 Thanks for noticing. Reasonable oil will continue the economic boom!
216 2018-06-13 23:36:07 Radical idea here but, why don't we produce our own oil. 
217 2018-06-13 23:36:04 If you keep it well moisturized and avoid irritants then your skin balances itself out. Side note: your face can get oiler if you're drying your skin out too much because your face thinks it needs to produce more oil
218 2018-06-13 23:35:58 a recipe. I am trying it myself tonight with Tomatoe Paste (i didn't have crushed or regular tomatoes), Olive Oil, garlic, salt pepper and a little bit of sugar.  I am trying to learn
219 2018-06-13 23:35:46 Hoy hice arroz con el oil que se le salio a mi pluma and guess who’s already doblada en el sillon ...
220 2018-06-13 23:35:33 I'm smiling. He is in the bath, because I can type and keep an eye on him. But there will be hair washing.  And he has a small 'fro and Hates getting it washed.  Then, there is the argon oil on put in after.  I will love it, when he's sleepin, lol.
221 2018-06-13 23:35:12 North Korea must've just discovered oil
222 2018-06-13 23:34:56 IEA　There is the possibility of a downward revision to our economic assumptions in the next few months. The world economy is feeling some pain from higher oil prices.

227 2018-06-13 23:34:26 Seriously does anyone actually eat tuna in vegetable oil these days? Like do you actually prefer super oily fishy flakes? And why do they put it so close to regular tuna? To trick us into eating oily fishy flakes cuz they know it won't sell otherwise?!
228 2018-06-13 23:34:26 原稿できたけどおぼえてねーーーーーー！！！！！！！！
229 2018-06-13 23:34:25 You don't think blowing up the Iran deal (world's 5th largest oil producer) had anything to do with this? 
230 2018-06-13 23:34:15 I Needa Go One Of These Mornings && Get My Oil Changed ..
231 2018-06-13 23:33:52 Looks like Adam's been sniffing the feet he works on. Since the 1960s, Scotland has produced more oil and gas than Norway or Kuwait-two of the richest oil-based economies on earth. England in contrast is utterly broke. We've been subsidizing their lazy, corrupt arses for decades.

236 2018-06-13 23:33:20 That's exactly what Trump wanted.
Now the US oil industry is happy. 
Saudi Arabia is happy.
Russia is happy...
Problem?
237 2018-06-13 23:33:18 The United States, Saudi Arabia and Russia see common cause in tamping down oil prices and boosting production — at least for now.
238 2018-06-13 23:33:01 Do you think it has anything to do with pulling out of the Iran deal? Increasing oil coming from there as well as YOUR FAVORITE KREMLIN?

260 2018-06-13 23:30:24 We already have the infrastructure lying fallow. Out of sheer indicipline the equipments were just lying fallow akin to the oil refinery. It was a quick win for NSIA. Purely commercial venture.

278 2018-06-13 23:27:46 Walmart said it’ll be a 3 hour wait for my oil change so I’ve been posted up in a Big Joe chair on the vacuum aisle

290 2018-06-13 23:25:54 i read thicc oil and was SO confused
291 2018-06-13 23:25:46 LETS GO 100% OIL INDEPENDENT IN THE USA.  DRILL BABY DRILL!
292 2018-06-13 23:25:42 Sorry Blabs but the day after the election @POTUS Trump began working to make America better, car manufacturing, capital, then the tax bill, deregulation, coal, steel, oil pipeline and other business friendly investments. All indicators down under Obama, 1 yr. under Trump all up.
293 2018-06-13 23:25:32 I honestly used to hate it but it’s the only dressing I’ll use now. I’ve tried lemon juice and olive oil before and it’s pretty good too.
294 2018-06-13 23:25:31 I've go too solutions for that our domestic oil and and bio fuels I really could show you how
295 2018-06-13 23:25:24 Oil prices are set by demand which  should be no different  than raising  the price of generators when a hurricane  is coming. Should be considered  gouging !
296 2018-06-13 23:25:24 Big Oil manipulating Tesla stock? I’d love to hear your proof. An EV supply chain saving 10s of millions of jobs is ludicrous, unfortunately-GM bailout saved 1.2m Jobs. FYI, 83% of TSLA shares is institution/insiders. 30% of float is short. That’s it.
297 2018-06-13 23:25:15 Mr. President, why not remind the Saudis as members of OPEC to do something to help bring the price of oil down. They seem to like and respect you giving you the royal treatment on your visit!

303 2018-06-13 23:24:18 #TRUMP in the trade wars forgets Canada supplies USA with aluminum which helps carry their beer, and oh yeah Canada has those oil pipelines in Alberta - he single-handedly could crush their beer and oil supply aha, sheesh imagine if Canada made their guns as well? :p
304 2018-06-13 23:24:11 Why would you use tea tree oil !?!? 
305 2018-06-13 23:23:55 Ugly Blondes - Oil and Wine
306 2018-06-13 23:23:51 Here’s a tip : 
 Mix two tablespoons of sugar, one tablespoon of olive oil and a few drops of lemon juice rub in for 30 seconds and then wash off this is good for reducing large pores and exfoliating the skin and remove oil and impurities 
307 2018-06-13 23:23:44 I’ll have to find someplace else for crap dry cleaning, crap beer, crap oil changes and knockoff MLB jerseys
308 2018-06-13 23:23:36 We don't get oil from OPEC
309 2018-06-13 23:23:27 Avocado toast. Sweetbread with a tbs of grapeseed oil and  melted cheese.  Don't eat animal saturated fats. NO sausage. Beans on brown rice as a side dish, add a few tbs of olive oil or grapeseed/avocado oil on the rice. Add oils to soup, mashed potatoes, yams, etc. Oil dressings
310 2018-06-13 23:23:21 Soak it and use tea tree oil
311 2018-06-13 23:23:08 Foreign whip , my oil change cost a car note

317 2018-06-13 23:21:52 Thanks Melody. I'm taking fish oil too, and a regular multi. I showed all this to my doctor and she agreed, but I'm still in a limbo of partial info. I am taking another scan in a year.

319 2018-06-13 23:21:43 Excuse me. How do you oil a snake?
320 2018-06-13 23:21:31 You raise the taxes on steel and aluminum and you have the Guts to question OPEC’s pricing,,Nigeria is a member of opec,,your white ass ain’t getting near our oil for free,that’s all I’m saying

328 2018-06-13 23:19:42 @gmbutts @JustinTrudeau @Bill_Morneau The supertankers headed for Asian markets out of Louisiana will be impossible to compete with as they carry significantly more oil at far less cost than Aframax tankers out of Burnaby. Did anyone crunch the #'s on this before approving #KM?
329 2018-06-13 23:19:39 OPEC has been manipulating oil prices since Pres Carter. What have you done about it? Nothing!
330 2018-06-13 23:19:37 You can rub'em with olive oil until it loosens up enough to pull off (can also use canola oil, corn oil or baby oil as well)

332 2018-06-13 23:19:09 Well, theres the 66% budget cut to the budget for the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and the 30% tariffs on solar panels.More importantly though, it’s the hiring of Pruitt to run the EPA, an oil guy who could give 2 shits about clean energy. And policies show it
333 2018-06-13 23:19:03 It was just like oil to the fire. Sirius was blinded with anger, he was furious. He grabbed Reg by his shirt and pinned him against the wall. It didn't took even a second, his wand was poking Reg's neck threateningly.

336 2018-06-13 23:18:32 its the only option we have today given the infrastructure in place. if you want more renewables then run a platform that shows you guys are halting all expansion of any roadway infrastructure canada wide. we know oil is needed - AB NDP agrees - you guys are on the wrong side.

342 2018-06-13 23:18:05 We know from our interactions with @nevadaart (borrowing work from them for our Edward Burtynsky: Oil exhibition and sending objects from our collection over for their Unsettled show) how fruitful north/south cooperation can be.
343 2018-06-13 23:17:57 Imagine working 80 hrs a week on an oil field then seeing some dude tweet about how hard it is to stream a video game while he’s making millions of dollars

346 2018-06-13 23:17:23 The BP oil spill was a “man made disaster” Ken Friedman’s continual abuse of his employees is quite different and should not yield another lucrative venture built on the skills of capable women. He has a lot of work to do before he deserves a seat at the table. Very disappointing

351 2018-06-13 23:16:56 From Google “Oil prices have been driven higher by political unrest in North Africa and the Middle East, where much of the world's oil comes from”.  - 2011
352 2018-06-13 23:16:54 Standard oil agrees, 100%
353 2018-06-13 23:16:43 Chef Gusteau cut up some acne, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was his first born child, along with hot sauce.
354 2018-06-13 23:16:43 We will use alternative fuel if they don't lower down the oil price.
355 2018-06-13 23:16:33 I hear you, it just seems implausible to me that a 4-year intervention that only had modest effects on dietary intake would reduce invasive breast cancer risk by 68% and diabetes risk by 51%.  Is a little olive oil really able to prevent cancer and diabetes so effectively?
356 2018-06-13 23:16:25 Retweeted Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump):

Oil prices are too high, OPEC is at it again. Not good!
357 2018-06-13 23:16:25 One of the best dishes I’ve made. I’m in heaven. Tiny splash of Truffle oil inside and fresh dill on top — two of my fave flavors. Husband loves it too.

373 2018-06-13 23:15:00 Thank you for making such a succinct case for indyref2 - why indeed should Scotland give her oil revenue and taxes to people of your attitude towards them?
374 2018-06-13 23:14:50 Medicare & Medicaid only, what about SSI, the VA, Farm subsidies, Oil subsidies, Cattle subsidies, the freeway system, the NAVY, MARINES and Air force, who's paying for those, secret Santa?
375 2018-06-13 23:14:49 Or the social skills that help you get free olive oil are predictive of many good outcomes?  There must be something causing these differences.
376 2018-06-13 23:14:48 Well done
377 2018-06-13 23:14:42 is anyone else a ‘supertaster’ ? like when you taste things you taste them like.... taste about every ingredient in food? cus I taste everythinggggg all the way to the oil the food was cooked it.
378 2018-06-13 23:14:39 Fiscal surplus is raising more than they spend. And Germany actually last year. Bit of a debate happened on what to do with it.
So is the argument now "oil won't fill the black hole of Scottish budget so meh"?
379 2018-06-13 23:14:33 Me too Bill.  And I'm not 100% crazy about his oil dealings but I'd vote for @JustinTrudeau over @realDonaldTrump in a heartbeat.

395 2018-06-13 23:12:34 Unless you live in a liberal haven that likes taxing folks gas is under $3/ gallon. USA oil production will slow at below $60/barrel. Leave opec be.
396 2018-06-13 23:12:31 Coconut oil lozenges need to be a thing.
397 2018-06-13 23:12:10 The unemployment rate has been steadily declining since Obama took office, staying on trend isn't Trump's work. Meanwhile consumer prices are up. Oil has been high since he backed out of the Iran deal & now American industries are hurting due to his moronic trade war.
398 2018-06-13 23:12:06 Even better. We considered, very conservatively, that the oil sands have the same carbon intensity as the rest of the world's oil. You can see this if you read the study, e.g. page 5 where we count all barrels as only 400 kg CO2.  If oil sands more GHG-intensive, effect greater
399 2018-06-13 23:11:57 Thought we were independent from gulf oil, why are speculators pushing up the price,greedy that's why.

404 2018-06-13 23:11:39 Oil patch workers are pretty highly paid. They can’t support their families on minimum wage and lose EI if they work. And good idea or not, they are searching for jobs in their profession instead of taking any available job.
405 2018-06-13 23:11:19 LOL, from 11pm to 5:30am. The secret is to keep to that schedule seven days a week. I'm on a keto diet, meaning low carb, high fat. I've been loosing two pounds per week. Shit fits that didn't before. I just discard "carby" stuff and put more oil/butter in/on it. :-D

414 2018-06-13 23:10:08 Thank you for the support.  Costs will drop hopefully in our new facility.  Prices for patients may drop, especially for oil.  Recreational prices will be much higher after Monopoly markup however.
415 2018-06-13 23:09:59 Right...and four years ago, spiking oil prices were “Obama’s fault.”   Maybe if Trump hadn’t added tariffs to imported solar panels and cut back on domestic alternative energy development, we wouldn’t be so addicted to fossil fuels.

425 2018-06-13 23:09:06 Thank you for sharing your story and your furbaby pictures! If the chaos is over the top, try CBD oil for cats! Available on Amazon, and other sites. When I adopted a stray, my cats hissed and screamed, the CBD oil calmed them all down!
426 2018-06-13 23:09:00 Snake oil salesman automatically equals Alt-Right? Whatever you say try troll 
427 2018-06-13 23:08:54 Pictures of him naked, slathered in motor oil, peeing in the residential water supply somewhere wouldn't even be the most notable event for him at this point.

434 2018-06-13 23:07:54 Art teacher found out that I painted my oil painting with a palette knife instead of a paintbrush( like she told us to) but didn't get mad lol. I wonder if she noticed but didn't say anything, or just didn't notice until I finished?

443 2018-06-13 23:05:32 Colleen and I bought CBD oil. And I’m decorating an envelope for a diehard order, and she goes

“How high are you, ya fucking marijuana head”
444 2018-06-13 23:05:29 Oil prices always high in summer!
445 2018-06-13 23:05:09 Exactly! Never about the causes or they’ll kinda of make up bogus reasons (the “US” imperialists want Iraq’s oil, lol ) or half-truths that it’s all about the “MIC” (which is only one factor and usually not the overall dominating one or at least not usually IMHO)
446 2018-06-13 23:05:05 you could try tea tree oil.. it helps a lot
447 2018-06-13 23:05:02 Please, please, do something about the price of oil!  The heating bill for this old house (1935, hot water, oil heated, radiator heat) is astronomical.  We are being driven out of the last of our family homesteads.

451 2018-06-13 23:04:07 Canada can renegotiate the NAFTA deal that has Americans not getting oil subsidies, but you don’t see tariffs on oil, or anyone saying it’s being bumped in the US, now do you?
452 2018-06-13 23:04:05 @ChuckGrassley Why in the world would you want to try and stop CBD oil from being sold? The benefits are healthy and there is almost no THC in it. It's not a drug. You really should do some research.
453 2018-06-13 23:03:52 He's pretending like he'll address the rising oil prices. And will probably make a few statements aka lies.  As soon as the oil prices go down after the summer travel season, like they always do, he will lie like his negotiations caused the oil prices 2 decline. Mark my words!
454 2018-06-13 23:03:49 Dish soap for all oil and grease stains.

50/50 -  water / witch hazel then add a about 12 -15 drops of a natural oil like Lavender, Eucalyptus, Rosemary, Cont..
457 2018-06-13 23:03:29 I can’t wait to light up a vanilla or rose scented candle, ease myself into a lavender scented, foamy bubble bath with classical music playing in the background and rub jasmine oil on my skin afterward, after lying in my fluffy white bathtub for a bit, of course.

465 2018-06-13 23:02:52 Just because there are criminals(or snake oil salesmen) we should not lose our rights.  Plus the FDA will have jurisdiction to regulate as they see fit.

482 2018-06-13 23:01:07 Point (c) has been sneaked in to embarrass pipeline defendants. It’s smart politics & NDP knew that it’ll be defeated by the Liberals & the Conservatives & thus they’ll get a chance to toot the horn.

This is not reasonable considering Canada’s economy is dependant on oil.

487 2018-06-13 23:00:21 High oil prices are good for our economy if we allow jobs to be created in drilling and associated industries (i.e. steel, tooling, chemical feedstocks, transportation, and many others). When the Petro industry dries up, so do many others. Look at our stock market at end of 2016.

495 2018-06-13 22:59:17 I call BS we weren't even getting oil from Iran. We have a glut of oil but the EPA has made it nearly impossible to rebuild refineries that have been hurt by natural disasters and the building of new ones through regulations.
496 2018-06-13 22:58:56 Have you noticed restaurants grocery stores & utilities have lowered prices? Now that PPL have more $ in pockets central bank is about 2 raise interest rates 4x this yr & oil went up affecting prices! Big corps are behind blocking border security so illegals keep wages down!

4) Imprison infants
5) Take away workers’ pensions

511 2018-06-13 22:56:28 If the U.S. got control of the oil in Venezuela, it would pay for the food. 
That would throw OPEC into a tizzy, and bring the price of gasoline down to a decent price.  Europe is getting hosed right now.  It’s $7.00 a gallon there.  (€1,876 p/liter)
512 2018-06-13 22:56:12 Maybe you should do something about that Spanky, you know instead of playing golf and tweeting for a change? You have access to US oil reserves. You could reduce dependency on OPEC oil for fuel production.

522 2018-06-13 22:55:09 The way to respond to high oil prices is to DRILL, DRILL, DRILL!!!! Produce American oil from Alaska's North Slope, the Gulf of Mexico, the Dakotas and every field we can. Doing this has the advantage of creating good paying jobs until the flood of oil brings prices down.
523 2018-06-13 22:54:38 Finally changed my oil
524 2018-06-13 22:54:35 @SenSchumer read it the way he meant it.  He's quoting the older Texas saying, before the oil boom.

531 2018-06-13 22:53:13 If you hadn't ended the deal we had w/Iran, then maybe we wouldn't be experiencing the price gouge in regards to oil that the top economist projected we experience by ending the Iranian deal.

1.5 tbsp cider vinegar
4tbsp rum

533 2018-06-13 22:52:57 My experience is from when I used to mix pig diets - we included both soy bean meal and soy oil in the diet but we used just enough oil to keep the dust down, as it was very expensive. The soy bean meal was also expensive, so we switched to home grown peas to make it cheaper...
534 2018-06-13 22:52:39 I was thinking they would bring in a giant shredder and mulch it all, maybe even share it with their homebuyers. No, let's just pour off-road diesel on it and fill the skies with poison ivy oil.

541 2018-06-13 22:52:15 No way man. Obama overregulated the economy and tried to stamp out frackers. They pumped that oil despite him. He had slow growth and  tepid GDP numbers and tried to wave it off as the "new normal" He never really cared about the private sector.

560 2018-06-13 22:49:50 I don’t believe the taxes changed the hike on gas prices. Ca usually announces when they do, so I know it isn’t the taxes. I did hear in the news that the cost a barrel of oil has gone up, even Trump states gas has gone up. It’s not only here in Ca.
561 2018-06-13 22:49:47 Midwestern employers are short-staffed. They're still offering recession-era wages, though. They need to start paying people better to induce new hires. Real wages haven't budged in 20 years. They're smarter about this in the oil patch, and show a better grasp of demand curves.

571 2018-06-13 22:48:38 I got covered and asphyxiated by a talking oil slick on an away mission and replaced by a Klingon & although it hurt (a lot!) it was right for the Enterprise security staff. I have no regrets and definitely won't bear a half-Romulan daughter in the future past...

578 2018-06-13 22:48:11 What I don't get is...  Not many people know that Canada and Mexico supply half of our oil and we make a quarter of it ourselves.  Also, 10% of our gas is ethanol.  So, we pump 15% OPEC gas.  Why...  Is 15% of the product being used all we talk about and pay for?  Je confus.
579 2018-06-13 22:47:55 See, the only thing you’re fixated on is votes. I respectfully ask you take a moment, go ahead google about freedom of movement, oil, gas import /exports from EU to Uk & vice versa, businesses, students and how much they contribute to UK.

Saying otherwise in my opinion shows a lack of imagination, especially in a world where Eldora has a date.

589 2018-06-13 22:46:32 Unfortunately for you, a great many of the 55% wanted greater powers and also got conned by Westminster snake oil salesmen. Now, this is my saloon. I ban halfwit cowboys barging in here to challenge a dude having a quiet drink at the bar.
590 2018-06-13 22:46:29 Apparently me dealing with my anxiety as an adult is partly me taking extreme advantage of good days so today I sent like 30 BookNet Fest emails, got an oil change, was at work for 8 hours, am at the grocery now before I record a podcast episode tonight. 
591 2018-06-13 22:46:27 some people don’t understand that when the oil field isn’t doing well, families have to relocate. my dads been on a rig since i was five years old, he’s not gonna change his career over it. he’s gonna chase the oil. i LOVE when prices are high, means my family is taken care of.
592 2018-06-13 22:46:21 Unfortunately she had swallowed the MSM rhetoric whole without questioning it. She actually told me that the North Sea Oil was all gone and that nobody drinks whisky any more. It was painful and quite clear that latent racists such as her have been emboldened by Brexit. Very sad.

615 2018-06-13 22:44:43 @Canada Sold you 40% of your oil last year.  Wait until they raise their prices!
616 2018-06-13 22:44:09 You are a liar. Why was the John Bolton Pac involved w Russian oil?
617 2018-06-13 22:44:07 We are selling it and it's making money above what Scotland spends. New fields are deeper so there will be extra costs to extract so worth is unknown.

Is oil your argument for as it's really not helping
618 2018-06-13 22:44:01 #tytlive Does Mexico have oil?
619 2018-06-13 22:43:54 Bruh wait until early August. I’m sure Charlotte will lose some players that just don’t want to play anymore and Rice will have someone quit for some oil job.

621 2018-06-13 22:43:40 Mike those are national economic indicators   To be fair inflation is growing but that’s mostly due to supply and demand and raising oil prices.

630 2018-06-13 22:42:47 It's only contributed if there is a surplus in Scotland budget. In past 35 years we've spent it and then some (GERS, published by Scottish Govt).
So no, I'm not using a recent slump, I'm using decades of data.

643 2018-06-13 22:39:56 @realDonaldTrump Want lower OIL prices? Release 10 million barrels from SPR. It would cause oil traders who are driving up prices to sell. Threat to do it again.

We can incentivize them to open more factories in Canada wich can makeup for the loss of Jobs we had in Oil industry. We need to plan for future from now tho.

Lower oil costs help grow strong and vibrant economies. Why are we allowing ourselves to be screwed by foreign interests when we don't have to.

654 2018-06-13 22:39:00 The cost of financing ... Bonds ... The economy will contract because fewer people will be able to afford increased prices (stocks ). Oil prices are currently increasing (95%+ of products/services are directly reliant on oil).

668 2018-06-13 22:37:03 Well all true. But two things unless we invest in projects that are working on bringing down the cost by improving the tech, the cost will never go down.

699 2018-06-13 22:33:15 #WINSday is the best performance Oil in any Motorsport. #Giveaway #WinItWednesday #ENEOS #Contest #Racing #Winner
700 2018-06-13 22:33:10 Mr. President, thanks to your efforts, America is producing much more of its own oil. We will soon have no need for OPEC at all. Shove it down their throats, sir!
701 2018-06-13 22:32:53 Well ladies and gents, my desk neighbor (an older lady) emailed me a link today to her online store for CBD oil so I guess you can say I’ve been welcomed?
702 2018-06-13 22:32:52 Furiously rubbing bio oil all over myself in the desperate hope my stretch marks will disappear in tume for me holiday tomorrow #bigbootyprobs 
703 2018-06-13 22:32:47 @realDonaldTrump if U.S. is producing more oil than ever before, why does our gas prices reflect what OPEC does?
704 2018-06-13 22:32:35 That’s good to hear, @Vic4Gov. That’s really good for the state of Colorado. For personal reasons, we have business in the oil and gas business.
705 2018-06-13 22:32:29 I hope the nips don’t sizzle with oil splash back!
706 2018-06-13 22:32:23 If the Saudis are driving up the gas prices how come we are exporting 20 million barrels of crude oil a day we got a brand new spanking refinery in North Dakota
707 2018-06-13 22:32:08 I can’t do hair but I massage scalps if you have coconut oil
708 2018-06-13 22:31:53 I Second you Sir,leaders like@thakurjaid who had burn their midnight oil and have made remarkable contribution in the party didn't receive the ticket which they deserve,why is that so?we need an answer.
709 2018-06-13 22:31:46 Wow. The guy not in uniform, eating his lunch, and helping change my oil does not make me feel comfortable. #PleaseDoNotTouch
710 2018-06-13 22:31:30 Vitamin E oil!! No scar!
711 2018-06-13 22:31:29 it’s good for hair bc it removes sebum (oil) and delivers essential vitamins and fatty acids to the scalp!!!
712 2018-06-13 22:31:25 I wish that was true, Candace.  The squeaky wheel gets the oil.  We need to stay together to beat the mob.  Some days it seems like it's impossible but we will never give up.  The future of this country depends on the silent majority.
713 2018-06-13 22:31:21 Have you ever seen a TSA officer pull a full jar of coconut oil from someone’s carry on? Well I just did, along with containers full of witch hazel, hairspray, solution, and lotions. Like... how long have we been doing this people???
714 2018-06-13 22:31:17 tfw you want to process foreign crude because your oil production has collapsed but can't do the job because your refineries have collapsed too
715 2018-06-13 22:31:15 I don’t mind pumping gas simply because I have to do it even if you aren’t around.... but like oil changes and maintenance, taking it to the dealership... I’ll let you handle tht.
716 2018-06-13 22:31:07 No, oil prices are high because of YOU! #TraitorTrump
717 2018-06-13 22:31:03 We need REFINIERIES built here in the USA
We have the oil......build them
More jobs to MAGA
718 2018-06-13 22:31:03 I use grapeseed oil and/or jojoba oil as the carrier oil and add rosehip, teatree, argan and a lil bit of frankincense essential oils
719 2018-06-13 22:30:55 Currently filling the 13b with oil....
720 2018-06-13 22:30:50 President Trump doesn't control oil prices.
721 2018-06-13 22:30:46 Natural gas just broke out of a consolidation triangle. Gas storage is at a multi-year low in the United States and while oil  is near multi-year highs, natural gas is just coming off multi-year  lows. This recipe sets the stage for a solid surge in natural gas.
722 2018-06-13 22:30:46 So what you gonna wage war again and steal oil or off shore drilling fucking up the ocean or pipe line from Alaska sommyou can fuck up the ground...
723 2018-06-13 22:30:41 Tea tree oil!
724 2018-06-13 22:30:40 Think this means whenever a leader decides to stop selling their countries oil/goods in US$ on the global market, the US invades them or arranges a way to kill the leader bringing regime change so the new regime will continue to sell in US$ keeping it the primary currency
725 2018-06-13 22:30:38 We’re halfway through the week which means it’s #WaterworksWednesday! One of our absolute favorite materials for faucets and hardware is oil rubbed bronze. We think this metal is a stunning addition to any room, & love how striking it can look against a neutral color scheme.
726 2018-06-13 22:30:26 Come on, Poki.  Just because you have fresh oil in your car does not mean you can beat on it now
727 2018-06-13 22:30:25 Mengusap Hidung Dgn Baby Oil Sebelum Tidur Dapat Membuat Komedo Berkurang
728 2018-06-13 22:30:18 Yeah, that’s the fantasy the Green Party sold us in 2000 before they elected a Texas oil man to the White House over Al Gore, the most environmentally conscious major party candidate in history. Only extremists buy the “what’s the difference line”.
729 2018-06-13 22:29:59 ICF families say where is US oil to stabilize markets Franklin! @realDonaldTrump: Oil prices are too high, OPEC is at it again.
730 2018-06-13 22:29:58 We call them followphobia, it get as it dey do them for body if dey no unfollow you
731 2018-06-13 22:29:48 Not at all. However, I don’t think it makes a very compelling case about Saudi Arabia owning the US. It having tons of oil money is always a big draw for private business but they don’t make any real connection as to why Saudi Arabia is holding the US hostage.
732 2018-06-13 22:29:41 It’s simple, whenever @nikizefanya drops a new single. I listen to it as I bathe myself with crispy fry mix on a hot boiling oil
733 2018-06-13 22:29:40 Hey STUPID you back out of the iran nuclear deal which had increased oil production. So your stupidity increased the oil prices
734 2018-06-13 22:29:33 Investors will also be looking for further guidance from the Federal Reserve on future U.S. rate  rises. This upcoming announcement after the crude oil inventory looks  to be more decisive for WTI Crude Oil futures next directional move  during the coming weeks.
735 2018-06-13 22:29:25 Mr President Trump, Can you do anything about OPEC and the rising prices of oil?
736 2018-06-13 22:29:16 Baby oil. Oil those abs and walk around glistening lol!

740 2018-06-13 22:28:42 Got a discount on my oil change and I didn’t even put on eyebrows today 
741 2018-06-13 22:28:31 I love the smell of sarsaparilla. Making an essential oil of the herb just so I can wear it on my skin.
742 2018-06-13 22:28:24 I currently have small cell lung cancer tell your dad to try CBD oil it does help alot x
743 2018-06-13 22:28:12 That reminds me. My oil change HELLA over due
744 2018-06-13 22:28:08 Oil prices funds the Muslim / terrorist world. They deserve a living but no way on Sharia  callaphate.

I tell u oil producig states will b d list develop cause de will be clouded with fight on share formula
746 2018-06-13 22:27:47 Hey, restaurateurs, let's back away from the ledge and stop putting fried eggs, truffle oil, and banana peppers on everything.  They're three tastes that taste great on NOTHING.
747 2018-06-13 22:27:40 We are also considered one of the poorest states too. We have managed to keep our population low. 5 million in the entire state. We also don't have oil wells in our coastal waters. Great grouper fishing, mountains in the upstate, skiing just inside NC. Id say we have it all.
748 2018-06-13 22:27:31 Pump more oil!
749 2018-06-13 22:27:12 What is the right price for oil, moron? For milk? For bread? For a car?  You have no clue.
750 2018-06-13 22:27:08 The largest resource, oil, is not producing any significant profit. The largest wealth sector, finance, has been relying on all UK tax payers.
Actually they aren't. Small business are massive growth but SNP have raised taxes and rates on them costing money.
751 2018-06-13 22:27:07 i don’t like adding oil to my pomade do i just heat it instead but that’s a good tip too!
752 2018-06-13 22:26:54 I just want to thank Bush II for getting us to a place where congress no longer has a say in how and who we sell weapons to,
Well, especially if they own lots of oil,
753 2018-06-13 22:26:39 maybe if u read the rest of the thread u would have realized i'm advocating for the use of CBD oil. i'm against idiots abusing their animals by poisioning them with THC!
754 2018-06-13 22:26:36 Me: *excited yungboi wanting to tell my mom i did a castor oil pack for ny fibroids*
Mom: *becomes negativity triggered anytime i mention being in pain or my fibroids* *Gets mad because i brought it up/starts argument*
755 2018-06-13 22:26:21 Oil cleanse at end of day to remove makeup, use gentle cleanser of choice after to remove residue. Tone with Neutrogena Pore Refining on cotton after. CeraVe SA Lotion day & night. Neutrogena Rapid Clear Stubborn Acne Daily Leave-On Mask at night. Should help.
756 2018-06-13 22:26:20 Hope Argon isn't the hot hair oil.  
757 2018-06-13 22:25:56 everyone has a complex ass skincare routine and I just wash my face with tea tree oil 
758 2018-06-13 22:25:56 then you should remove Saudia Arabia because its football not oil.
759 2018-06-13 22:25:54 Aren’t you essentially animal welfare advocates for livestock? What about all those subsidies for oil and ranching? What do taxpayers get out of those big payments?
760 2018-06-13 22:25:35 He's so shady, even the snake oil salesmen avoid him at all costs!!!!
761 2018-06-13 22:25:23 Woke up to an oil change, coffee, food and tampons.  he’s ok sometimes
762 2018-06-13 22:25:16 Por eso precisamente te invito a que veas los datos reales y veas los costeos que hacemos. Extranjeros se ríen de nosotros por vender crudo a precio internacional a refinación y petroquimica, siendo la misma empresa. Hay otros artículos de Oil Magazine que podemos discutir.
763 2018-06-13 22:25:14 It takes 3 Babies to get I bottle if Baby oil
764 2018-06-13 22:25:08 I had read in my oil feeds this was coming. You're right, makes total sense.

766 2018-06-13 22:24:56 The fakest news is promulgated by the biggest fools, and the biggest fool is you! You've fooled some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but I'm still watching. You're selling snake oil to a crowd of willing buyers, can't fault that.

769 2018-06-13 22:24:18 Makes them an enabler of homophobic muslim rape and kill gangs! You do know they rape gays and then toss them off roofs like dirty Kleenex when they're tired of their little games then go back to pumping oil to sell to countries whose ppl hate Chic-Fil-A
770 2018-06-13 22:24:18 For a very nice tomato sauce you have to buy pachino tomatoes, garlic and extra virgin oil. 
In a non-stick pot put a bit of oil with garlic, cut the pachino tomatoes and put them together. if you like vodka you can add some of it instead of water.
771 2018-06-13 22:24:16 You can do an exercise: Imagine just one day without everything that comes from foreign countries. If I think here: No coffee, no bananas, no chocolate, no natural gas, no oil for my car, no uranium for power plants... My country would stop. Could imagine the jobless numbers??

776 2018-06-13 22:22:14 nooo hehe I get it. it’s an oil painting so it looks a bit off
777 2018-06-13 22:22:08 Do you see a devaluation/export correlation? I haven't. US growth & oil prices are the biggest drivers.

781 2018-06-13 22:21:50 If your pomade is getting chalky and hard to work with I use a drop or two of oil (tartes oil is amazing and so is Josie marans oil) and it brings it right back to life! Just so you can get all your product!
782 2018-06-13 22:21:48 Avon skin so soft dry oil spray - green bottle.   Mel Gibson swore by it when he filmed Braveheart.  It does work - better than insect repellent.
783 2018-06-13 22:21:47 i started doing it for some health reasons and it’s helped soooo much, the weight loss and energy are awesome bonuses though!! and i haven’t tried MCT oil yet, i have a coffee with coconut oil every single morning but i’ve been meaning to get some MCT!! that sounds amazing :’))
784 2018-06-13 22:21:36 U shouöd consider, that we are a country of engineers and can not rely on natural resources like oil, gas, gold. And is it really our fault that people around the world are interested in our products?? We are not dumping prices or state sponsor our industries like china.
785 2018-06-13 22:21:16 Got an oil change and new tires and my car is so so happy and loves me so much but my bank account just texted me saying we need to talk so there’s that........

787 2018-06-13 22:21:14 "The special proportion stuff is snake oil. What’s critical is his endocannabinoid system is exposed to both CBD and THC"
788 2018-06-13 22:21:13 You now just noticed? Well, you’d better send Jared over there to those greedy oil desert people and give them a good talking to or you’ll take away their frequent guest discounts at all Trump Hotels, that goes double at Trump Hotel in DC. That’ll teach ‘em.
789 2018-06-13 22:21:13 I agree. We need to do something to lower prices. How about more US oil could that help
790 2018-06-13 22:21:06 We had really low oil prices during the Obama presidency.  What's your excuse?
791 2018-06-13 22:20:59 So my dad is a mechanic and he'd often bring home his working overalls to wash them, and for some reason I'll never understand my cat Silver really liked to roll in them even if they were full of oil, gasoline and whatnot 
792 2018-06-13 22:20:57  idk why I’m so invested in your oil situation, but now I am lmao you gotta go asappppp
793 2018-06-13 22:20:56 Getting back on my iron pills, primrose oil, and apple cider vinegar shots
794 2018-06-13 22:20:47 The throats? Grilled - all you do it put olive oil, butter, garlic salt, pepper, Tony’s and grill until it’s white, not pink!! Yumm 
795 2018-06-13 22:20:45 Coconut oil
796 2018-06-13 22:20:40 hahaha its hard to go against those veggie trends w/o feeling a kick in your popularity! Kale chips are wayyyyyyyyyyyyyy overpriced, but you can make them really cheaply (kale, oil, salt, cumin, turmeric) and I think thats a fun intro to them
797 2018-06-13 22:20:37 They’ll be well oil’d later.......... 
798 2018-06-13 22:20:34 everyday life is made more expensive by high oil prices, the people who control oil oppress the people.
799 2018-06-13 22:20:06 Know what would be awesome? If you could less common denominator conservative and more forward thinking progressive. Oil prices are a global thing. Not an NDP thing. I know this. You know this. My 12 year old knows his and when I’m getting home I’ll confirm that my dog knows this

806 2018-06-13 22:19:29 OK, but you have to admit that makes (slightly) more sense in the case of steel, aluminum, and oil than it does for milk, corn, and sugar. 

The double whammy of protectionism and subsidies raises our prices, lowers our standard of living, cripples our industry.
807 2018-06-13 22:19:29 Agreed. Notice how equities dropped as Oil rose today, a few words from a certain someone once this move tops will do the trick.

813 2018-06-13 22:18:58 We don’t need you brother!   Now a days people use videos to tell the story and the eyes of the world can clearly judge.   The wealthy rich nations of Saudi Arabia and the UAE with the help of the US and Israel invaded Yemen for its oil and death followed.  Case closed.
814 2018-06-13 22:18:43 In the future I’ll probably do it again for brief periods, but keto is an awesome diet. Have you gotten mct oil yet?!

I can show you how to drop half your size in 6 months eating until full using generous amounts of butter and oil. Sounds like science fiction but it's reality.
818 2018-06-13 22:18:15 Oil prices are too high, OPEC is at it again. Not good! - prices will start to come down once Trump targets the issue, take to the bank...

Or eat high alkaline greens and there's cans of coconut oil to drink now n then

BTW way, conversion therapy is against human rights in alot of countries because of the negative it does
823 2018-06-13 22:16:44 My petrol costs have gone up 28% in 2 years and my mileage hasn't changed. Yet crude oil is still significantly cheaper than it was in 2015.
824 2018-06-13 22:16:41 I can see the light hey , apparently coconut oil works better though.

838 2018-06-13 22:15:15 The last Jedi was like, since when did Star Wars become about who has the most fuel efficient star ship? Forget the Sith and Jedi Star Wars is becoming a series of films about the true evil of Big Oil
839 2018-06-13 22:15:06 Sounds sickening. There are some thing that have to made the original way, and pizza is one of them. No cauliflower, no pineapple. Gotta have great dough, tomatoes, cheese, olive oil, and maybe sausage.
840 2018-06-13 22:15:03 Who cares about oil, #Dotard! Why not focus on solar energy and cleaner renewables instead?

844 2018-06-13 22:14:53 Sean Hannity isn't news and he isn't a journalist. He's a two bit entertainer and snake oil salesman.

854 2018-06-13 22:14:02 What I do know, is that the price of oil has gone way up and will continue to because of trumps actions. This will affect manufacturers and farmers, therefore, it will have a lasting impact on our economy and jobs. 9/
855 2018-06-13 22:13:57 You said oil prices weren’t a big deal when they were over $4.50 under Obama. Remember that Chuck & Nancy? So what’s changed besides the letter next to POTUS (R)?
856 2018-06-13 22:13:47 We are the biggest grower of cannabis for the foreign market. However giving the oil from this plant to a 12 year old lad is illegal. Amber Rudd’s husband a grower, LEGAL Mr May financially benefits from cannabis LEGAL

858 2018-06-13 22:13:41 I think they use almond oil for their fries.
859 2018-06-13 22:13:40 Guess what dumb ass, we are the largest producers of oil, tell our companies to charge less, aren't you in charge?

863 2018-06-13 22:13:24 Try using some lavender essential oil on your pillow. It has that calming effect that could get you to sleep.
864 2018-06-13 22:13:24 No I think it’s the gas I just got my oil changed
865 2018-06-13 22:13:22 Good point about oil prices and our share of global markets.  Yes, PORKUS clearly is delivering on those fronts and of course also -- dramatically -- in destroying our alliances.  It's happening so quickly.  I feel sick.
866 2018-06-13 22:13:22 Decentralized Assassination Market And Basically, You're Fucking Stupid just pay my isp to avoid getting an oil change for

874 2018-06-13 22:12:33 Agree @JustMyOwnOpinion. Also, Alberta has taken on more than its share of the transition to green energy, with wind and solar projects and phasing out coal. Notley inherited a one-dimensional oil economy and the transition away from that takes time. #pnpcbc
875 2018-06-13 22:12:21 Drill our own oil on our continent and turn the Middle East into a camp site.
876 2018-06-13 22:12:19 Trump doesn’t control the oil prices

878 2018-06-13 22:12:14 Exogenous fat oxidation doesn’t necessarily equate to endogenous fat oxidation. If I were to consume a tub of coconut oil, increasing the likelihood of caloric surplus and minimal insulin secretion, based on that logic will oxidize stored triglycerides in adipose tissue?
879 2018-06-13 22:12:10 Even if this has nothing to do with Russia, it has everything to do with the price of oil which is why he’s tweeting about OPEC. 8/ @FBI
880 2018-06-13 22:12:06 US engineered coups in South America and support of rebel groups and brutal authoritarian regimes has done much to damage the region. An influx of guns and drug money from the US further destabilises it. The current focus on Venezuela smacks of a straightforward grab for its oil.

890 2018-06-13 22:11:06 You just love funding oil countries like Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.  Afraid to move forward with technology - just like a Luddite!  I wish you well, but I think you are about a decade or two behind in your knowledge of energy.
891 2018-06-13 22:10:59 Think of ur kid and stop being closed minded or just watch Fox News. Check vacancies at EPA they aren't even hiring scientist, hiring oil company peopleWE WILL SOON BE IN POLLUTION LILE LA OR CHINA 
892 2018-06-13 22:10:50 Yeah we are producing more oil than Saudi Arabia ,but we need to drill everywhere.. especially where there is some wildlife left of course

899 2018-06-13 22:09:55 This is our chance. The future of the Arctic Refuge is about to be decided. Join me and @TheWCS to say "Absolutely no drilling for oil and gas in the Arctic Refuge" http://1/#.WyGWMYkGCw4.twitter
900 2018-06-13 22:09:53 This is rich coming from a former oil & gas advisor from...Alexandria, Virginia.  The stand for salmon initiative (spearheaded by actual Alaskans) would create a two tiered permitting process, give more authority to the state, and protect our most valuable resource: fish.

902 2018-06-13 22:09:29 The US makes a profit at a much lower price point and we left all non-used fracking/drilling etc. fixtures waiting For the price of oil to go up. This castrated our opponents ability to profit as a nation from oil. 5/
903 2018-06-13 22:09:25 But bb the more you wash it the more it will get oil 
904 2018-06-13 22:09:25 The last meeting the outgoing US president had with the Canadian PM was about oil, the Arctic and Russia
905 2018-06-13 22:09:21 I thought all that fracking was supposed to bring down oil prices?
906 2018-06-13 22:09:16 57% of Democrats approve of John Kasich. 57% of Democrats need to learn not to fall for a snake oil salesman just because he shit talks Trump on The View.
907 2018-06-13 22:09:12 They raise prices anyways. The current tax on fuel is ridiculous. It punishes average people and affects the cost of everything. Oil price is set internationally. Tax changes in a regional gvt won’t change anything
908 2018-06-13 22:09:02 I’m trying to get myself to go that long! I get too itchy around the 4th day because I have dermatitis on my scalp and the oil irritates it 
909 2018-06-13 22:09:01 Great players put forth by Jack and Bob but if Oil are going with any of those 3 mentioned then its best to trade down 2-3 spots then take them.  Other teams will want to trade with Oil if they are passing on top10 talent
910 2018-06-13 22:08:59 I just seen this car place say "summer special $21.99 oil changes" watch I go there and them bitches tell me "121.99"  for my car  damn

Me: it’s $40
Grandma Rap: nope! I’m not falling for that crap! I’ll just keep using olive oil
914 2018-06-13 22:08:37 Are we seeing one snake oil salesman trump another snake oil salesman?
915 2018-06-13 22:08:24 i walked into CVS for paper, walked out with 3 pairs of eyelashes, tea tree oil, hair stuff, no paper, and a total of 100 dollars, everyone have a good day (:
916 2018-06-13 22:08:21 Can I rub some oil on you?

919 2018-06-13 22:07:57 Obama increased American oil production, which decreased prices due to increased supply.
920 2018-06-13 22:07:56 I ain’t never even heard of oregano oil until just now
921 2018-06-13 22:07:54 that little fat kid with the bunny are TELLING MY LOCATION to big oil
922 2018-06-13 22:07:36 Yep, sales told me “You only have to bring it in once a year or every 20K KMs for service, no more oil changes!”  That’s far from the truth, it’s been in service 20 times in 7 months, and is currently in service as we speak.  I hope they’ll get better.
923 2018-06-13 22:07:35 Hummus (a Middle Eastern dip with chickpeas and olive oil) is a heart healthy substitute for greasy dips to go with your starters.
924 2018-06-13 22:07:29 Yeah almond oil and you can use it in your hair
925 2018-06-13 22:07:07 I don't care what your wave counts are, when you have two of the largest oil consumers in the world pissed off about high oil prices, remember, they have the ability to move markets

928 2018-06-13 22:06:43 Would GOP accept donations from Planned Parenthood? Not sure it is that absurd, considering Democrats believe in Climate Change and the negative impact Big Oil has had on said Climate
929 2018-06-13 22:06:35 If the price of gas is lowered by government and demand rises, the oil companies will raise prices.
930 2018-06-13 22:06:34 If people are homophobic for eating Chic-Fil-A...
Then what's that make you for using gasoline that came from crude oil from countries where being gay is a crime?

932 2018-06-13 22:06:15 oil will be dominate for years to come, there's nothing currently that's better, why would Canada leave it in the ground very bad business plan

3) repeat the cycle
935 2018-06-13 22:05:54 When I ran was allowed to sell oil, a major part of the deal, are gasoline prices dropped, it gave farmers a better chance, manufacturers a cheaper source of energy, and left the US in good shape. 4/

941 2018-06-13 22:05:22 Can someone savy make a giff on Trumps blame game? Start with DACA-Dems fault, NK-every other Presidents fault, Health Care-Obama's fault, Oil prices-OPEC fault, Russia/Trump-Comey's fault, Women-Hillary's fault.
942 2018-06-13 22:05:21 When my mum told me about the voucher program, That's when it turned genuinely serious for me. It's Jesus at the temple flipping tables fury. I have no words for how bad it is. Some cities have used up their water and still oil fraking happens, causing LA strength quakes.

950 2018-06-13 22:04:47 i use cetaphil daily cleanser to wash my face at night, burts bees toner, ponds dark spot correcting moisturizer, then bio oil  & i just wash my face in the morning wit burts bees gentle foaming cleanser & then moisturize wit the same ponds cream. its the one wit the pink lid.
951 2018-06-13 22:04:45 When very few people control all oil in the middle east, any Sir plus that floods the market will lower the price per barrel. 3/
952 2018-06-13 22:04:35 I expected this type of answer. You use oil though.
953 2018-06-13 22:04:33 Ohhhh zile za transformer oil 
954 2018-06-13 22:04:33 How about Coconut oil?
955 2018-06-13 22:04:31 Jeez!  That’s crazy!  If you’ve lost Inhofe, you’re toast.   He’s an oil company stooge.
956 2018-06-13 22:04:29 Probably because no one wants to be busted for contributing to breaching national security.
957 2018-06-13 22:04:28 While the supply side might point to higher prices I suspect a consumer recession is triggered well before oil reaches $150 cramping demand and sending prices reflexively lower
958 2018-06-13 22:04:13 People focus on the nuclear aspect, but no one pays attention to oil. By lifting sanctions and allowing Iran to sell oil, it significantly hurt our worst enemies ability to profit. 2/
959 2018-06-13 22:03:59 Oil prices are too high, Trump is at it again blaming OPEC. 

Oil prices are high because our President bailed us out of the Iran Nuclear deal which essentially means 500,000 barrels a day of Iranian production is off the global market.  Trump needs to take Economics 101!

963 2018-06-13 22:03:45 Boil for 5.5 minutes flat (put eggs in after water boils). Submerge in cold water straight after. Peel submerged.

Then leave overnight in a combination of soy sauce, (rice) vinegar and if you want to get fancy also add sake, mirin, sesame oil.

Submerge fully for best results 
964 2018-06-13 22:03:42 My hairstylist started giving me a hot oil treatment without me even asking. Bless up, cuz my scalp needed it.
965 2018-06-13 22:03:38 He was begging OPEC not to increase the price of crude oil by slowing production just before canceling the Iranian deal. What did he expect? OPEC is all about money, the same as him.
966 2018-06-13 22:03:37 Oh I googled it ! Got it . Hmm I’d rather just lather in coconut oil and use pads lol

977 2018-06-13 22:01:59 If we tell US government that there's oil in the UK, will the US take over the UK?

986 2018-06-13 22:00:32 I'm still trying to figure out how a $15 Trillion economy that uses 15 million barrels of Oil per day is going to operate on just Solar Power and Wind Farms.

988 2018-06-13 22:00:24 Kirsty Wark giving Jacob Rees-Mosely a real kicking on Newsnight. Excellent viewing. JRM is a snake oil salesman who has been found out
989 2018-06-13 22:00:17 Well stop the BS we produce enough oil in this country for our needs why must we depend on OPEC? Only you can change it?
990 2018-06-13 22:00:03 Custom order for Vax’ildan fragrance oil now has me thinking about everyone else and basically I hatelove everything.
991 2018-06-13 22:00:02 Lmmmfao that’s funny as hell nigga said the restaurant. Well get some castor oil.
992 2018-06-13 21:59:57 Ain t it some shit?
993 2018-06-13 21:59:55 CBD oil or Peppermint oil works
994 2018-06-13 21:59:49 Van was dropped off for oil change when elderly woman and disabled man were left inside in heat. Auto repair shop worker came to their rescue
995 2018-06-13 21:59:45 Claro con 17 años, planeo y secuestro a un gerente de la standard oil, que hizo de todo para no pagar regalías a la nación en los años 50 y 60, hasta que los mismos gringos lo obligaron, también hemos leído ese pedazo de la historia
996 2018-06-13 21:59:32 Oh! I should try that. I've been using camelia oil. Coconut sounds more heavy duty
997 2018-06-13 21:59:32 Our economy is dependent on the oil and gas industry. Also you greenies would like us to stop using Nuclear power which makes up 60% of our electrical supply.
998 2018-06-13 21:59:14 Hey Michelle how are you? Prayers and an illegal amount of Shell love to you too! Are you taking any natural remedies? Coconut oil and cannabis oil combine to make a cancer destroyer. Please look it up.
999 2018-06-13 21:59:13 I’ve started using special oil on my beard to make it smoother, I don’t know why ?
1000 2018-06-13 21:59:12 Basaahaaahaaaaa! Oil and gas over! Maybe in 20 years, maybe
1001 2018-06-13 21:59:09 If the UCP were really concerned about the province and it's people they'd support a bipartisan 5% provincial sales tax, instead of relying on oil to try to float a budget.  Boom and bust cycles are what is screwing this province over, at the mercy of world oil price.
1002 2018-06-13 21:59:01 getting an oil change, new car battery, and signing my lease tomorrow  hello adulting i’m ready for you
1003 2018-06-13 21:58:57 As an oil kween I need all the oil control I can get, can't wait to see the results  
1004 2018-06-13 21:58:52 Don't see Trump putting tariffs on imported oil.  Wonder why?
1005 2018-06-13 21:58:43 Are Muslims in Baltimore only allowed to wear that 1 oil scent? That shit stinks
1006 2018-06-13 21:58:35 You're trying to tell people how to conduct themselves, from behind a keyboard. As if Bomani or anybody else is going to say "okay, I'll stop because you said so." Rub some lavender oil on your temples if you're feeling vexed.

1011 2018-06-13 21:58:07 better go get u some fish and cooking oil lol
1012 2018-06-13 21:58:00 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President. You declared oil prices too high. EXTREMELY AGREE. Low paying jobs don’t equate to high gas prices. Taking too much of my families budget. BEGGING you to fix this like so many other things you’ve done so far. Ty for your service.
1013 2018-06-13 21:57:44 Look, I’m not saying she’s innocent… Sounds pretty fishy to me I have to say… I’m just saying we don’t have anywhere close to enough facts to convict her in the court of Twitter
1014 2018-06-13 21:57:24 Sees Antarctica trending. 
Clicks thru. 
Ice melt. 

I recall 1980, worldwide, we addressed the ozone hole in our atmosphere. 

But Massive industrialization + an oil based economy spewing carbon into our atmosphere has so many more ve$ted intere$$$ts than fluorocarbon aerosols.

1020 2018-06-13 21:56:36 How did you take it?! There’s so many different options for it and I’m not sure which one works the best  vaping, capsules, just putting the oil under your tongue? Which worked for you?
1021 2018-06-13 21:56:36 Spending 40 bucks on an oil change rather than 40 on my nails... faulting 
1022 2018-06-13 21:56:29 Does it come with baby oil or peanut butter?
1023 2018-06-13 21:56:24 And, on a more personal note, our old oil heater just ran out of oil. Cold, wet, windy and post it notes telling me to order more oil and..... Well, there is no helping some people!

1026 2018-06-13 21:56:01 So I just used Motor Oil on a fire and caught a field on fire. 0/10 do not recommend.
1027 2018-06-13 21:56:01 Thank you bud
1028 2018-06-13 21:55:19 But it's not OPEC. Its greed and poor ecenomics policies in place. 

In 2008 OPEC used to produce less oil then they do today. And what about making America energy indepentant like Bush's plan.
1029 2018-06-13 21:55:17 Then develop the oil in our country.
1030 2018-06-13 21:55:15 Republicans, Trump & Shell Oil say it's a Chinese Hoax.
1031 2018-06-13 21:55:13 Rupee may fall against dollar, prices of imported goods will rise such as petrol
1032 2018-06-13 21:55:03 Castor oil.
1033 2018-06-13 21:55:03 @RolyUnGashaa I just had my belly button pierced . It got little bit of scab around it is this normal ?had it done last friday. Been using tea tree oil to cleaner because that the piercer suggests  .
1034 2018-06-13 21:54:59 Retweeted Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump):

Oil prices are too high, OPEC is at it again. Not good!
1035 2018-06-13 21:54:55 Chinedu can never get a jail term, he's a hard working courageous creature that cannot wait to steal from oil proceeds. There will be an approvingly protest when @Abdul_A_Bello gets a jail term.
1036 2018-06-13 21:54:43 So why don't you back renewable energy sources! Stop doing what's already been done and fucking with the oil industry
1037 2018-06-13 21:54:34 Why? The answer is simple. It’s neither a commodity nor a currency. 1- Man cannot invent a real commodity- like oil, sugar, grain, gold...you get the picture...and 2- Government will NEVER let the private sector create /control a monetary counterfeit printing press. Ever #bitcoin
1038 2018-06-13 21:54:34 All of these people complaining about high oil prices did not give a damn when OPEC floods the market and real good paying American jobs are lost. 
It's supply and demand like everything else, wake up America.
1039 2018-06-13 21:54:27 Not once the oil's drained away.
1040 2018-06-13 21:54:14 Then stop buying oil from OPEC and stop selling our domestic oil to China.  What's next? Invade Venezuela to get their oil?
1041 2018-06-13 21:54:08 Donald "snake oil" Trump
1042 2018-06-13 21:53:46 If you thought you have seen it all with KPMG, Deloitte and Nkonki,  there is a case of Global Audit Firm Ernst & Young involved in malfeasance in a global oil giant involving covering up the theft of stock and fraudulent reporting.

1043 2018-06-13 21:53:45 i’m debating if I should buy bio oil to get rid of some acne’s scars or not
1044 2018-06-13 21:53:42 Yeah too right. They will often need modernising though, mind you depends where you are really. A lot of places don't have central heating and see all electric, or use oil or wood instead, which is nice in its own way. Good luck!
1045 2018-06-13 21:53:31 We have  nuclear base near our biggest city and the  military old arms dump is in the sea off our west coast.   And funny enough we are one of the very few oil rich countries to become poorer as a result.
1046 2018-06-13 21:53:28 Leave the oil in the ground. Please.
1047 2018-06-13 21:53:26 @StephenDahmerMD  @vireohealthNY not impressed by lack of educ. that could have saved me money.Responsibility not taken.Quote “I don’t think your issue warrants being escalated beyond me”.Lost money, perhaps it does.Patients need help not to be blamed.Pls reach out.Oil Everywhere

1052 2018-06-13 21:52:41 I’m not faulting oil for your opinion I’m simply stating that there are reasons.
1053 2018-06-13 21:52:31 But are they burdened with oil ?
Scotland's curse
1054 2018-06-13 21:52:27 The perfume one -- use a perfume that is oil based not alcohol based, they last longer.
1055 2018-06-13 21:52:20 What to use in Lieu of Pesticides? Neem Oil, Garlic & Clove Oil, Azatrol, StrawFlower Extract... the list goes on!

1059 2018-06-13 21:51:42 After the divorce is finalized. If there were no provisions in the divorce this is complete bs. Doesn’t change that he’s required to pay. My wife’s ex was an out of work oil rig tech. She had to tell the court not to suspend his license. Can’t get a new job without it. Dumb.
1060 2018-06-13 21:51:24 I guess the democrats never heard that it's the squeaky wheel that gets the most oil. That's why we need a new generation of leaders full of fire and fury
1061 2018-06-13 21:51:16 Are you unhappy with your body wash because it dries your skin out ? Put a few tablespoons of baby oil in it. Shake before each use!
1062 2018-06-13 21:51:11 if you REALLY want a Chik-fil-A sandwich..

Marinade your chicken breast in pickle juice for at least an hour, longer is better. Afterwards, dry your chicken breast. Give it a milk bath, add flour, then bath, then egg, then flour again. Pressure fry in Peanut oil.
1063 2018-06-13 21:51:07 Anyone know where I can buy a longer dipstick? Mine doesn’t reach the oil anymore
1064 2018-06-13 21:50:36 Just had to run @aj_smith90 car back to Walmart because when she went for an oil change, they didn't put in the oil!
1065 2018-06-13 21:50:34 Tories and the DUP ripping the UK apart. Scotland has realised they are only wanted for oil, not its people or culture. Demographic change will resolve NI again at the behest of DUP. Brexit has woken people up & is the best thing that has ever happened in 500 years 
1066 2018-06-13 21:50:31 I actually don’t know… Do you know for sure, would you bet your entire future on it?… If not then let’s let it play out
1067 2018-06-13 21:50:24 Basic things like tire changes/checking the oil, jumping the car. Things like that because you may not always be readily available and want her to be able to do these things just so she can at least get to a safe point or a point where you can come assist
1068 2018-06-13 21:50:19 I hope they weren't using condoms, oil and oil-based lubes can dissolve them 
1069 2018-06-13 21:50:06 I prefer the old fish oil that smells like old rotten fish.

1078 2018-06-13 21:48:40 Unfortunately, penny wise, pound foolish is the mantra of the oil industry.
1079 2018-06-13 21:48:39 That white girl that did all that nasty shit to her black roommate: putting her period blood on her bookbag, putting moldy clam dip in her lotion, spitting in her oil, sticking her toothbrush “where the sun dont shine” only got expelled & immediately accepted into another school.

1081 2018-06-13 21:48:32 Magic Tip: Carry a buckeye (it looks like an acorn) in your wallet to bring good luck. It attracts money and wealth. You can also wrap it in a $20 bill anointed in money drawing oil and keep it in in your wallet.
1082 2018-06-13 21:48:27 Maybe solar + wind + battery can help ease some dependency on oil.  Sure @Tesla & GE want to be part of this solution.

1086 2018-06-13 21:48:04 Should be called the bully campaign
1087 2018-06-13 21:48:03 Fox is also propaganda, it's just that they are the only 
ones covering the @TheJusticeDept scandal.
Fox is lying about Iran, Syria & Russia.
Because the owner, who by the way supported HRC,
is drilling illegally oil from Syria. 
Fox isn't the place to get facts about the world
1088 2018-06-13 21:47:56 Obama was a disaster. Remember when he signed off on bugging the delegates at the Copenhagen conference? And overseeing an oil production boom instead of investing in becoming a leader of renewables, all because of the oil industry and geopolitical interests in dumping oil price.
1089 2018-06-13 21:47:51 Despite God gifted CPEC & extremely low oil prices in International market during their treacherous rule, @pmln_org leaves a legacy of appalling govt debt of Rs 23 Tn, over Rs 1K Bn (double than PPP govt) circular debt & elec shortage still equal to #PPP govt.
1090 2018-06-13 21:47:27 If we produce enough oil to sell and export, why are we buying oil from OPEC any way?
1091 2018-06-13 21:47:22 Love it 
1092 2018-06-13 21:47:02 I still need to get an oil cartridge to take and STILL need bathing suits
1093 2018-06-13 21:47:01 Was at the convenience store. Dude in front of me had corn oil and condoms. Kinky but who am I to judge?
1094 2018-06-13 21:47:01 it also took me a month to call a drs office and make an appt, even tho i am a receptionist at a drs office, bc i'm afraid of the phone, somehow, so. not to be a millenial but CBD oil has helped as well
1095 2018-06-13 21:47:00 Did they actually see her type it?  Whoever did it is a disgusting human being, don’t get me wrong… But it really pisses me off that the entire Twitterverse is so quick to be judge jury and executioner based on little more than hearsay at this point.
1096 2018-06-13 21:46:59 Sweden and Norway are comprised of homogenous cultures and have a FRACTION of the US population. Govt money from oil surplus and redistrubution of wealth. Lmk when Norway has contributed any new businesses or increase to GDP. Idiot.
1097 2018-06-13 21:46:57 I just wanna drive my car .. I hate putting gas in it , changing tires, oil changes , maintenance .. I just wanna drive my car ......
1098 2018-06-13 21:46:57 Ohmygod the body shop tea tree toner,face wash  and the tea tree oil itself are my fav trio and work amazing. Shit be healed and clear overnight however if you have dry skin you might wanna moisturise after using tea tree oil cuz it’s drying.
1099 2018-06-13 21:46:49 Then go ahead Lance... go for it... tell BMW to go home, stop bringing in European cars...you don’t need Canadian lumber, oil, natural gas, or water right? and tell your POTUS to hire some workers in Iowa to make his ties and all the products you find at the 99 cent store 
1100 2018-06-13 21:46:39 Middle-east will now drench that trophy in oil 
1101 2018-06-13 21:46:35 What fun to call @Walmart auto center for hours and be told " we're open till 7pm". Then you go over for an oil change at 5:30, stand in line for 15 minutes only to be told "this guy at the counter is the last one we're taking for services" 
Really #Walmart WTF???? 
1102 2018-06-13 21:46:34 Good job. Russia happy. So is Iran. Putin like how your torpedoeing Iran deal raise Russian state revenue by decreasement of oil supply. Good boy.  The #MAGA comrades gladly pay higher gas price, knowing they enrich Russia.
1103 2018-06-13 21:46:33 Oil prices are too high. This is sim city all over again

1106 2018-06-13 21:46:17 Trump you ask Saudi's to drill less so your buddies made more. What kinda of BS r you talking about? 2nd Saudi is meeting with Russia to make an oil deal. You have no friends in the .
1107 2018-06-13 21:46:17 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
1108 2018-06-13 21:46:14 Why does Mike Scioscia perpetually look like he just dropped his car off for an oil change and they told him it’s gonna be at least 4 hours

1129 2018-06-13 21:44:20 "A lawsuit has been filed in Florida against Glencore, Lukoil and other international energy firms for their alleged role funneling bribes to corrupt Venezuelan officials in exchange for rigged oil purchase contracts involving state-run PDVSA."
1130 2018-06-13 21:44:13 thx deep note but its oil can harry
1131 2018-06-13 21:43:48 Trump’s reckless decision to pull out of the Iran deal has led to higher oil prices! These higher oil prices are translating directly to soaring gas prices, that disproportionately hurts middle-and lower-income people, since a larger chunk of their disposable income goes for gas.
1132 2018-06-13 21:43:44 I put peppermint oil in my foot bath and now my feet feel like when you breathe in while chewing gum........regrets

1134 2018-06-13 21:43:41 How to convey our country issues regarding oil field problem
1135 2018-06-13 21:43:39 You are aware of the price of a barrel of oil versus the projected price of a barrel of oil in your white paper?
1136 2018-06-13 21:43:28 Try shaving with coconut oil instead of a shaving cream! It’s super messy but I highly recommend! I never get razor burn.
1137 2018-06-13 21:43:27 dunno about anyone else but using baby oil to remove my tan just doesn’t work on mehelppp
1138 2018-06-13 21:43:20 Snake oil research yet again.
1139 2018-06-13 21:43:19 You just got shot down by the Democratic party still saying coal miners deployable!DNC announced the Democrats cannot take money from Coal Oil or Gas.Nancy wants it fixed where 200.00 is the limit from anyone who works in this industry
1140 2018-06-13 21:43:17 I use salt very very sparingly. Use herbs and olive oil and butter
1141 2018-06-13 21:43:14 And you must fail to realize we import oil from Canada as well; the nation you just trashed.
1142 2018-06-13 21:43:06 bio oil!
1143 2018-06-13 21:43:04 Why the heck he needs a respect? He should be taught a lesson with slippers for his dumbness on increasing oil prices and people running with money.
1144 2018-06-13 21:43:04 Oil prices are too high! Trump's failures in the middle east are the cause! Not good!

1146 2018-06-13 21:42:59 President Trump should Regulate all Regular Gas Prices to$2.50 dollars per gallon.  Just the Regular, and Diesel also, that would make it fair for all USA.  Other prices can remain the same, as the Oil/Fuel Companies control prices.  But a mandatory regular price could happen.

1154 2018-06-13 21:41:33 If you want to bring oil prices down, flood the market. Keep in mind that whatever method you will be using to flood the market had better be prepared to operate under low price conditions, or the price will just go back up after cutthroat competition.

1159 2018-06-13 21:41:07 I don't think I like that comment. I don't see anything filthy about that picture at all. I'm in a thong and bra with oil on my body holding a wine glass I thought it was kind of artsy myself. You hurt my feelings mister.
1160 2018-06-13 21:41:02 The U.S. Senate committee has just voted 20 to 1 to  reject Sen Grassleys amendment that would have made CBD oil illegal in  the Hemp Farming Act and just passed the bill introduced by Sen  McConnell. The bill now goes to the Senate floor!

1174 2018-06-13 21:39:55 As a “man” is it technically your duty or your job to handle anything on your “girlfriend or significant other” car? For instance, getting oil changes, maintenance/tires, and car washes? Also, do you ask or do you just do it? Im just curious 
1175 2018-06-13 21:39:51 Yeah my shit already tore df rippin and running a sorry bitch who cant even check to see if I got oil or anything what kinda man are u dumb bitch

1181 2018-06-13 21:39:02 Auto exports crucial to CDN economy. No auto plus oil at lower prices wo pipelines: lost jobs and mortgage defaults, plus stagnant or lowering interest rates.

1185 2018-06-13 21:38:33 We have more than we need here! stop our oil companies from exporting oil. What did you think that pipeline was for? To control supply and drive up your prices
1186 2018-06-13 21:38:30 He gets whatever he deserves for trolling. He is from the UK eh? Probably votes conservative. Putting up pictures of naked women and he is going to come here to troll about oil? Fuck outta here motherfucker! Call child support services if you have to (assuming he's not a bot).
1187 2018-06-13 21:38:17 the oil company oligopoly doesn't help
1188 2018-06-13 21:38:07 Much better policy if $6 per barrel on oil cos. for cleanup fund is reinstated instead of placing burden on taxpayers.
1189 2018-06-13 21:37:53 Are you serious… Given the way this thing is taking off, guilty or innocent they needed to lawyer up

1202 2018-06-13 21:36:58 Price of oil per barrel increased from $40 to $100 from 2005 to 2007. However Sensex moved from 6,000 to 20,000 during the same period...market sentiments are supreme...
1203 2018-06-13 21:36:55 Done green tea wo sugar and extra virgin coconut oil for end of the sahoor and i wanna throw up
1204 2018-06-13 21:36:49 Honestly though. This happens during every summer. No matter who is in charge. No one will do anything about it. As long as government has their pockets lined by big oil.
1205 2018-06-13 21:36:37 If you are pointing a finger and calling people racist-you are probably fanning the flames of racial intolerance.

1206 2018-06-13 21:36:34 back when i worked in retail, there was a guy who would come in and talk about how DANK OIL SO GOOD FOR DOGS HE PUTS IT IN HIS DOG'S FOOD EVERY DAY MMMM SO GUD and it made me feel like i was going to have a grand mal seizure
1207 2018-06-13 21:36:32 Can somebody please print out his tweets, take them to whatever high school he attended and demand to know how the hell he graduated? He's not some guy who changes my oil,he's the PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Someone needs to change his Twitter password, no kidding.

1229 2018-06-13 21:33:34 Pruitt's going for the Guinness Book of World Records in Ethics Violations for a Presidential Cabinet member. Maybe he'll make the front cover? A picture of him standing next to an oil well on the playground of an elementary school? 
1230 2018-06-13 21:33:10 Siiiiigh. So, after much diagnosis and a cracked (now replaced valve cover) my mechanic finds the source of another oil leak from the cam cap.

1246 2018-06-13 21:30:27 Countries with abundant food, steel and other mineral resources must form bodies to control its international price just like OPEC does for oil
1247 2018-06-13 21:30:26 Let me guess..a bunch of Arabs came 2 our country, got our oil companies CEO's and FORCED them all at gunpoint to raise their prices?

OPEC doesn't set prices for WTI (look that up),our oil companies do.

&  they take advantage of prices elswhere

U hve economics skills of an ant
1248 2018-06-13 21:30:24 Only Southerners are punished for crimes in Nigeria. If anyone in the north is jailed, he is a Christian.  Rilwanu Lukman n Jibril Aminu should have been probed for fraud in the oil sector but only Southerners who headed the sector  got probed. West,  Etete, Madueke.

1252 2018-06-13 21:30:15 Is he getting advice from Larry Kudlow? A recession is coming. Trillion dollar deficits. Rising interest rates. Rising oil prices. Trade wars with allies. Deregulation of banks and Wall Street. I say Bush 2.0 with no China to bail us out.

But would they get it?


1254 2018-06-13 21:29:57 Wow! NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh on Power & Politics talking about turning his back on the entire oil sector as its doomed by projections for the future use of alternative fuels. Reminds me very much of the rise of personal computers & experts predicting the end of paper.

@PnPCBC
1255 2018-06-13 21:29:51 Understand. Someday. You hope they’ll grow out of the messes but someday it will be spilled fingernail polish remover or her oil paint palette will fall on the floor.

1257 2018-06-13 21:29:40 don't hate Alberta to much it is one of their only industries and oil is what we use for fuels.......
1258 2018-06-13 21:29:31 You’d be right to worry about that. PMO is projecting exports will increase to offset the loss due to real estate. 

Doesn’t even look like we’ll maintain the previous year’s exports, without an increase in oil and decrease in $CAD.
1259 2018-06-13 21:29:13 Wait! Can’t you fix it?  I thought you were supposed to be able to fix everything!  You know if oil prices were low- you’d be taking credit!
1260 2018-06-13 21:29:10 ok guys get out your bikes and walking shoes...we can't bow to our addiction to OPEC oil.  Lets find a way to live without this dependence.
1261 2018-06-13 21:29:03 A. Relative to rUK Scotland's population has suffered badly under the Treaty.  As we live longer, Scotland needs a greater influx of young than we currently have to sustain our current lifestyle. 
B. I feel prosperous, you obviously do too. Many Scots are not despite the oil.
1262 2018-06-13 21:29:02 Is this the part where Donald lifts sanctions on Russia because of OPEC oil prices (not because Putin had Donald's saggys in a jar)?

1264 2018-06-13 21:29:00 They have more oil than there is in the Middle East, but they have to use foreign oil. Shows u have pathetic socialist dictators are!!
1265 2018-06-13 21:28:55 You need to cut a deal with Iraq !!!!! After all we’ve done for them, the least they can do for us is sell us all their oil at rock bottom prices  !!! Period !!!
1266 2018-06-13 21:28:54 In discussion in the offices of an oil company last Friday, I was asked, "Do you still have any belief that he might lose?" I replied that the polls have not reduced voter preferences to two camps: 1) Firm AMLO and 2) Never @MorenaExterior_  The 2nd camp could still surprise us.
1267 2018-06-13 21:28:53 We should all know by now when Trump says something he means exactly the opposite. He made a deal with the Saudi’s the first week or two he was in office. Oil prices skyrocketing benefits Russia that’s why he pulled out of the Iran deal.

1269 2018-06-13 21:28:35 Keep pumping oil yes?
1270 2018-06-13 21:28:34 Retweet it...let's get it out there before they decide just to take all what makes our great nation great...oil, gas, hydro electric, whiskey, tourism just to mention a few
1271 2018-06-13 21:28:25 Oil prices are soaring, but somehow you have time to chime in on all these local races? Get your priorities straight! #AlerttheDaycareStaff #DementedDonnie

1273 2018-06-13 21:27:58 They'll build oil pipe lines from Alaska to tim buk 2,but they can't build pipelines from the ocean to places that have wildfires especially California and they're close to the ocean, and they have all the money. I'm just not understanding why they go through this every year.

1275 2018-06-13 21:27:13 I’ve educated myself but then brain force plus snake oil salesman will probably cry about educational facilities being full of left leaning teachers and brainwashing people  the irony
1276 2018-06-13 21:27:12 It has a double sense for Gregory: on one hand, it means the celebration of the Triduum from which they are just emerging; on the other, it is his own ordination. But the two are not easily distinguished. The 'anointing' is both the oil of chrism & Christ's anointing at the tomb.

1278 2018-06-13 21:26:45 5). No matter what you think about the tax cuts, it has no bearing on the reality that fuel runs this nation. With out fuel, we stop. As long as OPEC and the middle east control the oil prices, our economy will be directly tied the rise and fall of oil prices. Read a book.
1279 2018-06-13 21:26:38 I use @FreshBeauty's Seaberry face oil to moisturize daily! There's also @acureorganics which is more affordable, and @JuiceBeauty
1280 2018-06-13 21:26:34 Didn’t you say that America was self sufficient in Oil? Why are we affected by high oil prices when we produce our own oil, and like you said we are now exporting oil?  #FakeNews
1281 2018-06-13 21:26:17 Wait... So we want to import their oil now? Doesn't higher prices of foreign oil make domestic production flourish? Doesn't that create jobs in the USA? Wouldn't more jobs #MAGA? This is literally what you're trying to do with tariffs.
1282 2018-06-13 21:26:10 @realDonaldTrump Just the threat of tapping the strategic oil reserve will knock several dollars off a barrel of oil in a day ! Doing it twice as much..
1283 2018-06-13 21:26:03 I can’t decide between Rousseau’s milk, bread, and water or Sartre’s metaphysical lemon, water, and oil.
1284 2018-06-13 21:26:01 I was called a hipster the other day. My reply was "I was born in 73 and I can change mine own oil, so that disqualifies me" #IllBeAtTheBar #LAliving
1285 2018-06-13 21:26:01 Besides we are not dependant upon OPEC for our oil have not been in a while. This actually makes us money because you can only purchase from OPEC with US dollars.
1286 2018-06-13 21:25:52 Who has oil refills
1287 2018-06-13 21:25:46 Oil stocks will crash in this weekend. Not exactly.　　石油株は今週末に暴落するだろう。いや、そうでもないよ。

1293 2018-06-13 21:25:02 I was burnt by the drill, gel all over my skin, she was very rough and got up randomly, rushed through and no lotion or oil or anything nice
1294 2018-06-13 21:24:47 Oil prices are high because you backed out of the Iran deal  and imposed sanctions on Iran. We are not stupid even though you act as though we’d never figure this out,
1295 2018-06-13 21:24:41 Hopefully you won’t miss our Oil Revenues too much
1296 2018-06-13 21:24:14 Putin's very happy with high oil prices. He works with OPEC to set output.

You gonna call him out? Didn't think so.

1308 2018-06-13 21:22:50 Last time oil prices where too high you blamed Obama. You said, "Gas prices are at crazy levels.  Fire Obama".   You are the cause for high oil prices.  You've failed...again.  Fake president in the White House.
1309 2018-06-13 21:22:47 1/2. An inaccurate recount of history. Deregulation under Bush directly resulting in the subprime mortgage fiasco. Bush tax cuts reduced the top income tax rate from 39.6% to 35%, and reduced capital gains and estate taxes. And the administration’s desire to go after oil rich.
1310 2018-06-13 21:22:29 Why is my oil change taking so damn long
1311 2018-06-13 21:22:23 * where they only wear shoes

1313 2018-06-13 21:22:16 @lookner Yemen's chief export beside oil, is fish.  That is the danger of being a "Banana Republic".

1316 2018-06-13 21:21:42 What happened to listing Iran oil on yuan denominated futures contracts ?
1317 2018-06-13 21:21:36 OF COURSE. I think “The Keepers” is still my fav.

1322 2018-06-13 21:20:49 It's easy. Use wok oil, lightly stir the greens in the oil, add a tablespoon or two of water, lid on, steam for two minutes, serve.
1323 2018-06-13 21:20:44 Coconut oil and black soap is not the answer to every problem.

Coconut oil does nothing but sit on top of ur skin and that black soap really dries ur skin out!
1324 2018-06-13 21:20:39 Yeah, those gals down at the shoe store.
1325 2018-06-13 21:20:35 My car really needs a oil change
1326 2018-06-13 21:20:35 And use an organic oil blend to moisturize instead of them funky lotions .
1327 2018-06-13 21:20:27 One which doesn’t actually know any much more of the matter, but does know how to exploit into making you think they do; snake oil.
1328 2018-06-13 21:20:23 God, this hurts me. Where is the humanity? Never buy palm oil.
1329 2018-06-13 21:20:18 Cherries have natural pain killing properties. Cloves/ clove oil can be used to temporarily relieve tooth pain until you get to the dentist. Just FYI. Sometimes you can forgo the pills.
1330 2018-06-13 21:20:03 Is she a god that needs to eat sacrifice? You forgot something.........Palm oil 
1331 2018-06-13 21:19:55 These oil company’s can’t pump money into your club forever, you won’t always be the best in England, as soon as that money goes your fuckeddddddd
1332 2018-06-13 21:19:45 Your the one that backed out of the nuke deal with Iran. Why don’t we just take the oil like you said during your campaign? Or maybe put a price cap on it in our country before we export so much like you stated?
1333 2018-06-13 21:19:36 @ArchWarhammer  Took me a fucking while to follow you. But good things are to be awaited.
Goddamn, I appreciate your big ass effort and I love your content, mate.

1349 2018-06-13 21:17:55 And you think you can talk them down on Twitter?!?  Excuse my laughter!   Why don't you talk to your buddy in the Kremlin?  He has plenty of oil.  Maybe he'll help prop your dishonest regime up with a bit of it., since you've been such a good boy in doing his bidding.

1360 2018-06-13 21:16:46 And I explained why it's not that simple to just implement it. Not really sure what more proof you need. We are still using oil because oil is valuable in so many ways and are tied into a giant ecosystem. You wan't to change that ecosystem that's whats very expensive.
1361 2018-06-13 21:16:34 If there was collusion, the obvious quid pro quo would have been the Russian Gazprom oil deal (which shifted to a something like 20% sale/investment to/by UAE, I think) & Tillerson at State. Arctic rights, Exxon. That was off, too much scrutiny.
1362 2018-06-13 21:16:33 Why they always go overboard on the oil with really dark women? Looks better raw rather than slippery

What natural/organic moisturizer can I use on my face to combat redness and dryness? 

- Preferably few to no synthetic chemicals
- Olive oil has been making it more red
- Something that doesn't cost millions of dollars

1378 2018-06-13 21:14:55 FYI, OPEC is dead. We actually produce our own now. This is gouging by subsidized big oil. Also, the house bill quietly floating to revalue our $$ back to gold is in part of OPECs' death

1386 2018-06-13 21:13:42 Dr. Krugman,
Can you estimate how much of the trade deficit w/China is actually profits held offshore by US firms by manipulating transfer costs? Also, how much of a surplus we would have w/Canada if you ignore oil imports?
1387 2018-06-13 21:13:29 We all know what that mean. DNC is telling oil companies to donate under different names and organizations.
1388 2018-06-13 21:13:24 People are waking up to the snake oil Republicans are selling.

1399 2018-06-13 21:12:12 Improving the fuel efficiency of U.S. vehicles is the biggest single step we can take to cut America’s oil consumption in half. In fact, doubling the fuel efficiency of new cars, trucks, and commercial vehicles would, by 2035, save over 5 million barrels of oil per day.
1400 2018-06-13 21:12:08 in theory, but MHRA have only licensed it for MS, so he'd need to find a doctor willing to prescribe offlist for pediatric use. Its also much higher THC than what he uses. Assume someone who knows what they're doing could dilute it with other CBD oil to create something v.similar
1401 2018-06-13 21:12:03 It’s probably not great when an oil change makes your truck noticeably better to drive.
1402 2018-06-13 21:12:00 Here's an idea. Quit exporting American oil.
1403 2018-06-13 21:11:29 Once the margins are back up there things will be fine. Much smaller margins on oil sand production. Stats have to include further facts

1409 2018-06-13 21:10:40 The US befriends Iraq to sell weapons, then accuses Iraq of having weapons, murders their leader and steals their oil. Lybia was a mirror image of greed. Now Trump befriends North Korea. Be afraid Kim, be very afraid! The world's largest terrorist organisation is coming for you!

1423 2018-06-13 21:09:19 Something that personally got rid of my acne scars was putting tea tree oil on a cotton pad and rubbing it all over my face. Dirt will come off and reduce break outs!
1424 2018-06-13 21:09:14 The special proportion stuff is snake oil. What’s critical is his endocannabinoid system is exposed to both CBD and THC. you cannot overdose and you’d have to take a lot of cbd to override its  therapeutic ratio.  Many parents are making their own oil with equal results
1425 2018-06-13 21:08:56 Mr. Trump your above and beyond the best President this country ever had and Yes Opec is Greedy!! Fix oil prices and Economy roars!!
1426 2018-06-13 21:08:54 Go to the nearest mirror and the reflection you see is the person whose fault it is that our oil prices are too high.

1434 2018-06-13 21:08:14 When boiling water and it starts foaming over, pour in some olive oil. Just a bit. It'll make the overflowing go away.
1435 2018-06-13 21:07:56 Kenrose, you need to read what Clinton did to alleviate prices of oil during his term, yes, the president can control the price of gas at the pump.

1437 2018-06-13 21:07:50 He’s talking about protecting the Native American sacred land that’s being shrunk in size by the @realDonaldTrump administration and the other Native American sacred land that now has a leaking oil pipeline on it, right?
1438 2018-06-13 21:07:49 Yes sir the oil prices were getting too high it was pinching my pocket cuz I have to drive using my vehicle all day I'm so glad we have a president that cares about the American people keep it up sir we're all behind you

1446 2018-06-13 21:07:18 Indeed.  It was caused by a a very rapid and sustained drop in demand (oil sector adjusting to low oil price)

1450 2018-06-13 21:07:00 Or maybe we don’t want someone ruining the environment, enriching his oil and coal company friends and stealing from the American people. You see like a pretty big POS.

1477 2018-06-13 21:04:44 No, a movement that gets big enough can apply pressure on the political system for a referendum. And Scotland is not poor. It has the most active oil fields in the world right now. Where is the money going?

1486 2018-06-13 21:03:56 there are no "pure/free markets" in energy and i don't think there should be. but by that standard nationalizing an oil company is no different from hiking the gas tax by a nickel.
1487 2018-06-13 21:03:48 Great. U.S. backed. Great. As if these people need anyone to prod them to fight. That's all they know. That's all they want, and that's all they do. We no longer want your oil for our children.
1488 2018-06-13 21:03:38 High gas prices are a signal to do your best to use less gas. Oil won't last forever and is too valuable to just burn, if there are alternatives.
1489 2018-06-13 21:03:36 The Code Sec. 48 business energy credit is a tax incentive to implement the government policy to encourage the production and use of, or conversion to, business equipment using energy sources other than oil or gasas a primary source of industrial or agricultural energy.

1541 2018-06-13 20:57:47 US is an undisputed superpower and they plan things way in advance.If they hv to remain a superpower they hv to control the major oil and mineral reserves.Gen Wesley clark had given an interview way back in 2007 and he had exactly narrated which countries USA will invade .
1542 2018-06-13 20:57:41 Ight now rub some of this praying oil on your forehead and prey on you....i mean pray on you
1543 2018-06-13 20:57:38 The only inflation driver right now is oil. It is affecting shipping costs, travel costs, and oil product costs - asphalt, fertilizers, plastics etc.

1546 2018-06-13 20:57:22 Well given all the bad press that he's received for trying to change the world which is obviously very much still controlled by oil giants, he has no real choice does he?

1549 2018-06-13 20:57:10 Guessing old filter gasket stayed on block which they should’ve checked, had it happen a couple of times but oil could’ve spilled on frame, should’ve been cleaned as well.
1550 2018-06-13 20:57:08 @LiamFox Genocide is going on in Cameroon and you are bragging about oil and gas deal signed with the government of Cameroon.
1551 2018-06-13 20:56:56 Jiffy Lube are some good con artists , I told dude give me the most basic oil change he still tried to up-sale, I stopped him and said bro you holding me up I got to hit the road soon give me what I asked for
1552 2018-06-13 20:56:41 oil,oil... 
1553 2018-06-13 20:56:27 "I'd like an oil change"
Okay well it's gonna be at least an hour till you're in and about an hour 20 till you're all done
"Well I have an appointment in [City that is a half hour away] at 3 can you make it?"

1556 2018-06-13 20:55:53 this woman at work asked for the spinach in her EGGS florentine to be wilted in oil and not butter because she was a VEGAN and I honestly still don’t know if she knows where eggs come from
1557 2018-06-13 20:55:53 Anaheim peppers finally dried up after, what, 5 hours? at 170 degrees, so I crushed what I could (wishing I had a mortar and pestle right about now) and stuck the remains in a little tupperware container and mixed in some olive oil. We'll see where this goes in a week!
1558 2018-06-13 20:55:44 They are also still using a lot of oil for their cars. Again the answer is fairly simple. We can't sustain our wealth without oil for a long time.

1561 2018-06-13 20:55:31 The "oh oh" voice is on the Oil Rig track of the OST, not any fight with Zod. And as far as I know it is only on the OST soundtrack track...not in the movie and not on the "complete score" track either.
1562 2018-06-13 20:55:08 Why must the soreness increase the day after physical activity? I thought it was hard to move yesterday. Today I’m like the tin man without any oil.
1563 2018-06-13 20:55:01 i got a essential oil diffuser and i have to use "freshwater" scented oils because everyone in my house is allergic to everything. pls shoot me.
1564 2018-06-13 20:54:57 Would be nice to remove oil from the business cycle.
1565 2018-06-13 20:54:56 Mix a shimmer pigment into the body oil!
1566 2018-06-13 20:54:54 Ok, thanks. And the other names on the list? All containing palm oil?
1567 2018-06-13 20:54:53 @dollarfire is an insane and sick troll. Let everyone on #OOTT know it. I mean he fucking wants to troll with all the shady and creepy shit on his twitter page? #WTI #Oil #CrudeOil #Brent #OPEC #CL_F
1568 2018-06-13 20:54:46 Once the oil is out, 
who cares where it come down? 
That's not my department,

1569 2018-06-13 20:54:42 Hot oil massage sounds so nice
1570 2018-06-13 20:54:41 And wet lips for shine and glossy lips...pink oil oooo that brings back memories. Contour gini?
1571 2018-06-13 20:54:34 Another friend helped me discover that the oil I’ve been using for them is “low burn oil” and can’t handle being in the oven at 450 for 40 minutes 
1572 2018-06-13 20:54:32 Ok I got some multivitamins, milk thistle (for liver), fish oil, and vitamin d3 (Ohio, baby). Wanted to get turmeric and probiotics too but maybe next time
1573 2018-06-13 20:54:29 Mix a shimmer pigment into the body oil. 
1574 2018-06-13 20:54:29 well golly gee donnie, just impose a 25% tariff on all oil products from OPEC! that will make them better behaved!
1575 2018-06-13 20:54:26 And it's about to get a whole lot worse thanks to all the rich people invested in oil who didn't want to lose even a red cent of their profits
1576 2018-06-13 20:54:26 Like no essential oil is going to stop your child from getting polio either. Goodbye 
1577 2018-06-13 20:54:18 Harkening back to 15 years ago, I just marinated some tofu and before I fry it, I made myself some popcorn on the stove, almost burning it, and dressed it with olive oil, nutritional yeast and braggs. #foodtimewarp
1578 2018-06-13 20:54:14 I’m such an Adult I got my oil changed today 
1579 2018-06-13 20:54:13 Thank you for sharing! We look forward to seeing you for your next oil change. Have a great day!
1580 2018-06-13 20:53:49 Of course they did @Presidency_Sy , they are corrupt puppets of #Israel! They want to control your oil, and have military bases with which to attack #Iran. I am thankful you have kept them out and rid the majority of their terrorists from your land. #Saudi can have the rest back!
1581 2018-06-13 20:53:48 I put too much coconut oil on my neck and didn’t rub it in enough lmfao 
1582 2018-06-13 20:53:48 Rosehip oil in the morning and lavender oil at night and orange blossom water as toner. Although my make up remover is part coconut oil and part castille soap and there is no issue with it.
1583 2018-06-13 20:53:25 Definitely bring back coal and increase oil production!
1584 2018-06-13 20:53:15 It’s officially hot af my coconut oil is liquid anytime of the day now.
1585 2018-06-13 20:53:14 i cut up some xtra firm tofu,put in nonstick pan w no butter or anything but u can use veg butter/oil if you want it xtracrispy!once it was crispy i put the buffalo sauce on while the pan was on super high heat & just seared them, tossing them till they were coated! so easy!
1586 2018-06-13 20:53:14 Mr. McDevitt my name is Chaz Kline and I’m the service manager at this location. I do see where we performed your oil change and also diagnosed a noise concern you had that took longer than expected. Please feel free to contact me at your earliest convenience

1587 2018-06-13 20:53:07 I'm buying a tesla, and keep hearing people say 'why should we subsidize YOUR car with tax incentives?!'  OMG how much we subsidize oil for ICE cars in america.  If we didnt gas would be $7-8  a gallon. but it's now $2.50.

People are easily manipulated.
1588 2018-06-13 20:52:55 Quit buying from them !!! We have enough of are own oil here in America. Then they will lower the prices !!!
1589 2018-06-13 20:52:34 If you know anyone that drives a 16 and newer Mini Cooper... it takes a new spec oil....I can almost promise you the "quick" oil change places do have the proper oil. Failure to use the proper spec oil will damage the engine and void the warranty. Please share.
1590 2018-06-13 20:52:31 And yet, when YOU blundered in, oil prices were LOW! WTF did you DO?
1591 2018-06-13 20:52:29 "Mud wrestle anyone in olive oil." 

Heh. Heh.
1592 2018-06-13 20:52:28 Or anyone who uses gay references as a burn
1593 2018-06-13 20:52:24 Donnie is playing Putin's card and about to try and convince you that Russian oil is cheap and better for America .It's been Putin's long time dream and Trump is his Sandman
1594 2018-06-13 20:51:56 2,500’ setback is for all intents a virtual ban on oil and gas development in Colorado.  Similar measure defeated in 2016 when practical heads prevailed.
1595 2018-06-13 20:51:56 Iran's oil prices went up.  Gee I wonder why, "stable genius".  DUH!
1596 2018-06-13 20:51:48 Yikes try to force it do grow & strengthen. Use coconut oil.
1597 2018-06-13 20:51:40 Speaking of eczema, raw shea, rose hip, and sweet almond oil has me like who is eczema
1598 2018-06-13 20:51:40 As oil prices rise, domestic producers will be incentivized to pick up the slack.  In addition, Canada and the U.S. lack effective refining capacity so that finished products like diesel and gasoline can make it to market without excessive markup.  Balance is needed!
1599 2018-06-13 20:51:14 So no more oil for SVG from Venezuela - Vincentians will now most likely have to face harder times going forward.
1600 2018-06-13 20:51:11 @jagvuar why did you need an oil rig workers jumpsuit to paint half a basket ball court?
1601 2018-06-13 20:51:01 Yes I know for a fact this is gonna be better than all the other ones. Conjuring, Annabelle ect. I just gotta bring my holy oil when I go see this. And my girl from Ahs is playing in the movie.
1602 2018-06-13 20:50:58 The oil change people finally took my coupon that I was using every time. 
1603 2018-06-13 20:50:57 WTI Crude oil: +0.42% Brent oil: +0.86%. Partially due to a surprise drop in US inventories
1604 2018-06-13 20:50:55 @Valvoline  Why are oil change operators requiring customers to pull their vehicles in to the bay for service? The speed of service has kept me coming back, but I do not like being being the one who drives in and out. Help me understand.
1605 2018-06-13 20:50:50 We have oil in bitoones.
1606 2018-06-13 20:50:48 I was told the answer was always coconut oil... that explains a lot.
1607 2018-06-13 20:50:22 lmao i just cut open the aloe vera leaf, take out the gel, put it on my face and use it as a 5-15 minute mask once or twice a day. then after i wash it off, i apply vitamin E oil
1608 2018-06-13 20:50:09 I bought some natural face oil from the internet and I’m highly suspicious that its just olive oil
1609 2018-06-13 20:49:48 I have used both quite awhile ago but it’s been so long now  but yeah oil is definitely more of a pain to clean up
1610 2018-06-13 20:49:45 apparently ur supposed to change the oil on a car??? RIP the juke

1612 2018-06-13 20:49:28 So be the first POTUS to drop big oil. We all know you don't have the guts to move the US to renewable energy and be a real world leader.
1613 2018-06-13 20:49:28 Any of these secondary markets have to do with Putin oil? I know he's made in roads in Venezuela. Just saying.
1614 2018-06-13 20:49:13 引火したら、もう手遅れさ…
1615 2018-06-13 20:49:13 Same!!! Although a part of me is still skeptical...
1616 2018-06-13 20:48:58 METHOD:
1) Mash up the lip balm into a clean container, add in the sugar, then mix to make a granular paste. 
2) Add in the coconut oil and mix again
3) Store in the fridge
1617 2018-06-13 20:48:50 Go get some anxiety medication, and liquid fish oil
1618 2018-06-13 20:48:50 Industry is quickly churning over wildlife space around the Planet for oil,..rare minerals or simply more space to build condo’s etc. Endangered species list is growing.

1620 2018-06-13 20:48:44 If on pan, then a cheap cast iron pan is best. Just something that has mass and keeps lot of energy when you put that cold-ish steak on. Get it really hot, some oil and drop the steak. Let it sizzle for a while (can peek at bottom if it looks good), then turn over.
1621 2018-06-13 20:48:42 I seriously need coconut oil
1622 2018-06-13 20:48:28 Typical liberal cess pool.

1626 2018-06-13 20:47:59 That should pay for the oil changes in a decent armed battalion. Laughable.
1627 2018-06-13 20:47:51 Switzerland has a sketchy “Cheese Cartel” or a Swiss cheese union that operates like a mob and/or OPEC but instead of oil they control cheese... this is both funny and cute
1628 2018-06-13 20:47:49 Lol I see I’ll save few quid to get ya Johnson baby oil
1629 2018-06-13 20:47:47 Oil prices are up because of your stupid moves on trade and the Middle East - get used to it.
1630 2018-06-13 20:47:40 it's like Pruitt wants to get canned so that he can collect all of the IOUs that he holds from big oil, chemicals etc.

1633 2018-06-13 20:47:13 I bought land too lol, when you making oil money and you’re single with no kids you can do this stuff 
1634 2018-06-13 20:47:10 Don't 4get coconut oil with Stevia on it 
1635 2018-06-13 20:47:09 I'd have thought it would have been fried in peanut oil.
1636 2018-06-13 20:47:04 testing results can be known in weeks, but we are asking if ZN could substantiate the PREVIOUS statements that ZN encountered oil with proof. So far you only provided statements without accompanying proof such as photos. This would help to prevent current ZN price volatility.
1637 2018-06-13 20:46:57 Do you know how any of this works? Go ask what happens to oil if you pull out of the Iran deal. You break it, you own it. Just like trumpcare.
1638 2018-06-13 20:46:38 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
1639 2018-06-13 20:46:36 don't know how to meet the demand for energy in todays world outside of oil.  So what if there is a special diamond or crystal out there like the one mentioned in this Prophecy, that when you shine light on it, it doesn't fade away, it just keeps shining, basically the crystal is
1640 2018-06-13 20:46:22 This oil money you are chopping alone..

1642 2018-06-13 20:46:05 Getting a new car, then getting things for the new car, then getting an oil change, then tires, then this, then that..... WHY CANT I BE 12 AGAIN AND NOT WORRY ABOUT THIS SHIT

1645 2018-06-13 20:45:48 Remember that time (or several) that you blamed Obama for the high oil prices?  Yah, we remember too.

Guess what?  The high oil prices are YOUR FAULT.  You should resign immediately.  Look to the ancient Japanese for what you should do next when you're dishonored.  Bye Felicia!
1646 2018-06-13 20:45:47 Oil back rubs and booty rubs are the best.  candle wax all day!
1647 2018-06-13 20:45:40 have shrunk to a point not that they will run out, but low enough to a point where the cost of getting the oil out of the ground will not be practical financially, and they say there's other means to do it, but in all reality I don't think they are saying the truth, they actually
1648 2018-06-13 20:45:19 Why is "Oil Tot" apologizing? :( He deserves a good long rest and relaxation to enjoy other things that keeps our favorite "British" entertained.
1649 2018-06-13 20:45:10 So. Prior to buying castor oil, I did a lot of research. I do not like trying new thing on my person; I feel like what I am doing is working why fix what ain't broke.

1651 2018-06-13 20:45:00 Bruhhh these “BawArabuz” are moving mad if they think Uganda also has oil
1652 2018-06-13 20:44:47 To be fair, about 75% of my effort has gone to building websites for oil and auto cos, etc. Most of the work has been in the service of marketing products and services. Impact perhaps. Good for humanity? Unclear. I appreciate your appreciation! Thank you for your work.
1653 2018-06-13 20:44:44 I only shop at co-ops or Whole Foods only if I have no better choice. I can see past the weird-ass food-like products (nutritionalism, anyone?). But mostly it’s that they smell like an essential oil convention, and not food.
1654 2018-06-13 20:44:22 oil or makeup wipes
1655 2018-06-13 20:44:15 That happens. (Not the receive money part)
1656 2018-06-13 20:44:04 OH God, no. We've always had racists rednecks. Think of the Clampetts without the oil, with a tendency to be racsits. You'll get the picture.

1658 2018-06-13 20:43:50 Getting real tired of the stupidity of the prez and people who follow or believe him. America is better than this snake oil salesman, but we have to prove it by voting all of them out.
1659 2018-06-13 20:43:43 This Marrakesh Oil makes my hair smell like pine 
1660 2018-06-13 20:43:39 Maybe you shouldn't have kyboshed the Iran Nuclear Deal which removed Iranian oil out of the market causing an uptick in oil price.
1661 2018-06-13 20:43:34 With massive oil intake and huge purchase power, India and China as a singular bloc can jointly squeeze OPEC for a lower price and better payment terms, including a moratorium on price increase.
1662 2018-06-13 20:43:28 INGREDIENTS:
• 1 tube of your favourite lip balm, mashed up
• 2 teaspoons of granulated white sugar OR brown sugar
• 1 teaspoon room temperature coconut oil
1663 2018-06-13 20:43:27 If America is the engine of the global economy, China is the oil.
1664 2018-06-13 20:43:20 Vegetable oil is a generalised term, which includes palm oil. Look for pure sunflower oil, or olive oil etc
1665 2018-06-13 20:43:20 #EIA #data: Remarkable jump in US #gasoline demand to 9.879 million bpd in week to 6/8, from 8.976 mln bpd in previous week & +610,000 vs year ago.

1666 2018-06-13 20:43:09 #CrudeOil closed higher on Wednesday. Closes above the 20 day moving average crossing at 68.16 would confirm that a short term low has been posted. If crude oil renews the decline off May's high, April's low crossing at 61.73 is the next downside target. $USO $UWTI
1667 2018-06-13 20:43:05 The fact that the President was on the Oil Rig makes me think the Enclave started the war, so the emergency government continuation shelters may have been filled with lower level personnel who were left out.
1668 2018-06-13 20:43:04 Everything you've done has resulted in higher oil prices for your boss in the Kremlin. But by all means, do go on blaming OPEC.
1669 2018-06-13 20:43:03 They will be no oil in 40 years at the current consumption rate .So this is good news
1670 2018-06-13 20:42:54 drill and frack drill and frack go team go lets head to the oil patch.

1674 2018-06-13 20:42:31 Well- no more. They’ve raped our land and exploited our resources. All our whisky ( billions pounds) gets exported through English ports. Our oil revenue goes to Westminster coffers. We supply energy to them and now they’re coming for our water.
1675 2018-06-13 20:42:15 Is it the same oil change we are all talking about? As in the one for cars?

1686 2018-06-13 20:40:47 Immediately googled Dog Oil and it was invented in Dukinfield, hah! Their FAQ does not answer why it is called Dog Oil. Surely that is THE MOST frequently asked question

1688 2018-06-13 20:40:39 The fact that a resource is finite is not a reason to avoid using it. All resources are finite. The sun will explode in about a billion years. Does that make solar power finite? When will oil run out? Heard that 50yrs ago...

3. As an incredibly intensive natural conditioner

1787 2018-06-13 20:29:16 Pardon my ignorance, but why is 'Vegetable oil' and 'Vegetable fat' on the list? I don't know about the other names, but I'd think 'vegetable oil' and 'vegetable fat' would fit on any oil or fat made out of any kind of plant ingredients? (for instance olives...)
1788 2018-06-13 20:29:12 ....after our new oil wells and pipelines become operational and can supply new oil refineries, OPEC may become a moot point. Just saying.

1817 2018-06-13 20:24:29 I make my shake with MCT oil & chia the night before. Can't stand them in my teeth.
1818 2018-06-13 20:24:25 Not to toot my own horn but made a really lovely dinner tonight which I would recommend to anyone. Roasted some butternut squash, garlic, one yellow pepper and one red pepper in some olive oil and black pepper. Then, whizzed it in my NutriBullet with some vegetable stock...
1819 2018-06-13 20:24:24 Supposed to be organic. I use oil & vinegar.
1820 2018-06-13 20:24:19 But they'll accept George Soros money's who has millions invested in oil...... the hypocrisy of the left is always mind blowing.
1821 2018-06-13 20:24:13 End result is the price of oil went up for everybody!
1822 2018-06-13 20:24:08 As a lady engineer, men who aren’t in this industry or field swear they know more than you.  

Nigga you let another nigga change your oil. Stfu.
1823 2018-06-13 20:24:08 Beard oil!
1824 2018-06-13 20:24:07 This Tory Government are extremely hypocrital. Many lives could be bearable by relaxing  cannabis laws especially for the little boy that suffers numerous seizures a day, without the use of cannabis oil, yet they think it's right to sell arm to countries at war! Where's the logic
1825 2018-06-13 20:24:06 Nothing to do with the fact that they have no significant oil reserves to support their economy...
1826 2018-06-13 20:23:52 Oil change
1827 2018-06-13 20:23:51 Nigeria: Clean up the oil industry in Nigeria:  A healthy environment is a human right.   THE NIGERIA GOVT SHOULD STOP OIL PRODUCTION IN NIGER DELTA UNTIL COMPLETE AND TOTAL OIL CLEAN!!!!  THE ONLY WAY!!
1828 2018-06-13 20:23:50 I took my car to the mechanics for an oil change, now my whole car is getting fixed.
Some lady tried to sell me mangos while I was there, I bought half a box.
???????
1829 2018-06-13 20:23:35 clove oil n tiger balm are literal gifts from god
1830 2018-06-13 20:23:32 Rose with fresh cherry tomatoes, fresh basil, olive oil and torn mozarella
1831 2018-06-13 20:23:31 George renewables are highly subsidized and are not the save all they are made out to be. A comprehensive energy approach makes more sense. A large portion of the NM economy is from oil and gas
1832 2018-06-13 20:23:12 Paraldehyde & olive oil enema is rectally administered to young children with epilepsy. 
It’s NOT licensed in the UK but imported from abroad. 
The Enema solution is flammable & Paraldehyde can melt plastic. 

The government thinks this is better than Medical cannabis?!
1833 2018-06-13 20:23:05 “....any snake oil salesman...” why is Grassley still relevant to passing our laws!? He should be at home in front of a fire reading a book. Instead he’s using metaphors from when he was young! This is INSANE
1834 2018-06-13 20:23:03 Your the guy that canny find a fucking oil painting in a portacabin Carlaw ya wrong yin
1835 2018-06-13 20:23:02 Some vintage Mediterranean cookbooks showed the frequent use of anchovies with meal prep... butter and anchovies with scrambled eggs; anchovies with olive oil and lemon juice in salad dressing; anchovies with brown butter as a meat sauce.  Thinking of giving this a try...
1836 2018-06-13 20:22:59 Someone showed me what I did to their leg in football n it looks like some bookey oil painting
1837 2018-06-13 20:22:57 I’m bout to drown it in tea tree oil
1838 2018-06-13 20:22:55 Scenes from today's docent training and enrichment program—this afternoon we considered Remington's 1905-06 oil painting "Evening in the Desert. Navajoes."
1839 2018-06-13 20:22:46 Saudis want $80/barrel oil. Jared delivered.
1840 2018-06-13 20:22:37 I'm going back to using whale oil.
1841 2018-06-13 20:22:29 the peach oil gloss from too faced is one of my fav formulas and also the lancôme juicy shakers!
1842 2018-06-13 20:22:28 Only stupid people will by that snake oil...if he said MDC are projecting a 100 billion economy at least after 5 year people would believe because it will take time for investors to have confidence to invest in Zim
1843 2018-06-13 20:22:17 We're not the war mongers, we don't pick the fights, so don't need all the defence and guns. So how would you do without our hydro, oil, lumber... hmm? Things are going to get a lot more expensive your way too.
1844 2018-06-13 20:22:13 I don't know about the US oil surplus but the Saudi-Russian alliance is a big shift in power and Opec by the end of 2018 c'est fini. Yipii.
1845 2018-06-13 20:22:11 Back from lunch! It was delicious! House Salad. Garlic Knots. Chicken breast cooked in garlic and oil with a side of broccoli & cavatelli. Entree and side were off menu.

*breathes garlic on you*
1846 2018-06-13 20:22:10 This is fucked. Britain is the largest exporter of medical marijuana, the fucking PM’s husband has MILLIONS invested in medical marijuana, yet they confiscate that young lads oil that controls his seizures. Why aren’t people on the streets about this? I’m making a sign now
1847 2018-06-13 20:22:10 Thanks to NDA Govt. atleast some relief is there from current exhorbitant oil prices.
1848 2018-06-13 20:21:42 And you can take the credit for it by pulling out of #IranDeal and creeping out the oil markets.
1849 2018-06-13 20:21:42 
1850 2018-06-13 20:21:40 Eating a bag of gummi fish cuz I read somewhere that they're a good source of Omega-3 gummi fish oil.
1851 2018-06-13 20:21:30 #shitholecountry just one of too many.
1852 2018-06-13 20:21:24 How much reliance do we have on OPEC oil?  I thought we were moving away from dependence at a rapid pace.  Didn't you approve more pipelines and drilling off our coasts?
1853 2018-06-13 20:21:10 Put a 25% Tariff on imported Oil from OPEC nations!! That’ll show em#TuckFrump
1854 2018-06-13 20:21:07 do u guys have cannabis oil
1855 2018-06-13 20:21:03 Wind can help cover the gaps in solar. Let's not have any Eco infighting. We should be focused on taking down oil and fossil fuels in general.
1856 2018-06-13 20:20:54 Quail eggs and blue bell gratin with raw slate gray olive oil in hot petit fours
1857 2018-06-13 20:20:52 Im using Dhai and oil for my frizzy hair.
1858 2018-06-13 20:20:51 This is fucked up. I’d happily donate some of my bud to this guy. We should all chip in a mug and make him as much oil as he needs.
1859 2018-06-13 20:20:49 Potable water is the new Oil
1860 2018-06-13 20:20:48 I have massage oil, who wants massage?
1861 2018-06-13 20:20:30 My point is that until the price of oil goes up governments aren’t to blame for a lack of investment. Regardless of which party is in power.
1862 2018-06-13 20:20:27 i need an oil change and my tires rotated this week
1863 2018-06-13 20:20:20 Spray them black then a watered down nuln oil and say it's a total eclipse... If you want to push for best painted then maybe add some Agrax to the base for depth.
1864 2018-06-13 20:20:09 Magama hudu
1865 2018-06-13 20:19:39 Scots willl  be back in straight away,,the EU has said so,they want favourable access to the largest oil fields in Europe.
Enjoy the brexit you tried to force apon us to keep our oil though!
I hope its sunny for you
1866 2018-06-13 20:19:33 This dude that’s doing my oil change is super nice and cute 
1867 2018-06-13 20:19:12 I feel you with the nail thing! Nail oil with vitamin e and jojoba has worked really well for me, I put it on when I have polish on too & it helps it to last longer and makes my cuticles/hangnails much better :) Polish helps to stop my nails from catching on everything as well 
1868 2018-06-13 20:19:04 Okay the only lie is the 1.8m abi? So what's the price Sir and the price of Red Oil?
1869 2018-06-13 20:19:02 It’s like riding w the oil light on, you see it but dc till shit ain’t workin the same

1871 2018-06-13 20:18:53 Eat less processed food to avoid palm oil
1872 2018-06-13 20:18:50 THAT'S oil! Those are some seriously amazing skills @Mainloop has!
1873 2018-06-13 20:18:44 Yes. FOLLOW THE MONEY. GOP is buried in financial ties to Russia via Trump's companies and ties to Russian oil refinery. Trump is Putin's BITCH.
1874 2018-06-13 20:18:38 Good idea.  So your plan is to reduce fuel prices so that US oil is not competitive and kill US oil jobs.   Some genius
1875 2018-06-13 20:18:38 Sem falar que alguns dos melhores estádios do Mundo são os Americanos: Lucas Oil Stadium, Rose Bowl e o Pontiac Silverdome estão entre os meus favoritos
1876 2018-06-13 20:18:38 No, you don't know where it came from.  We didn't give it because we didn't have it.

And no, it wasn't cash.  It was mostly swaps for stuff they'd traded oil for. 

If you want people to respect your opinions and ideas, you have to base them in facts.  Never too late to start..
1877 2018-06-13 20:18:28 Vn jour on qvestmendera : oil pourqvoi échoir?
J'ai mêdi la phrasé de bonne volonté...
1878 2018-06-13 20:18:23 He claimed JCPOA was terrible because he needed a reason to reimpose sanctions on Iran, so that the Saudi/UAE/Russian oil and gas oligarchs who paid him could be protected.
1879 2018-06-13 20:18:16 Sometimes it's more on policies than corruption. Try contrasting New Zealand GDP, world's least corrupt country, with those in top 10 or even to Japan -ranked 20th. With a government mindset that thinks of exporting crude oil and importing refined, we can only do so much!
1880 2018-06-13 20:18:14 I like fruity wine! I was thinking of having goat cheese pizza. I put olive oil on pita bread with fresh spinach, basil, tomatoes, & goat cheese. My kids love it & it’s healthy.
1881 2018-06-13 20:18:11 They are as averse to facts as taking a chilli oil colonic irrigation.
1882 2018-06-13 20:18:05 Oh yes... they think we’re a region or a county instead of a country. All our revenue goes south ( oil, whisky etc) They’re happy to take that. The  is in its death throes- mainly because we’re not being listened to- a constitutional crisis looming.
1883 2018-06-13 20:18:00 Iran is not North Korea. Iran has an abundance of natural resources, the 4th largest reserves of oil, 1st largest reserves of natural gas on earth. Iran builds over 1.5 million cars a year. If Iran decides to build nukes, there's nothing anyone can do to stop them.
1884 2018-06-13 20:17:58 First time you nailed it and understood what is US real issue! You’re self are your worst enemies. Focus to educate your people, fix your infrastructure and politics... then let rest of the world do the same to themselves... do not go and star another “oil war” and bully others.
1885 2018-06-13 20:17:55 Oil prices were never this high under Obama.
1886 2018-06-13 20:17:52 I’m at #CampaignTechAwards with @Battersea_ ‘s HEAD OF CATZ. I don’t see how we can fail to win given that he provides the oil on which the internetz runs @AmazeRealise #forthedogz #forthecatz
1887 2018-06-13 20:17:46 This picture looks like it smells of poor hygiene, cigarettes, cheap oil sheen, tree fresheners, and DAEP paperwork.

1891 2018-06-13 20:17:03 Peter, do you agree that invading of Iraq by British was a GENOCIDE and their main intention was selling weapons & gaining access to the resources such as oil? What is the reason you are keeping quite?Are you getting pressure from British background party members?
1892 2018-06-13 20:16:53 My peppermint oil is constantly saving my life

1894 2018-06-13 20:16:38 The seasoning mix used on fried seafood is less spicy. Thus, grilled food is actually hotter. Olive oil for flavor.
1895 2018-06-13 20:16:36 Página 12  habla de la causa OIL como algo digitado desde la Casa Rosada Realmente viven en un termo Todo llega
1896 2018-06-13 20:16:31 @UnileverUKI Pretty staggered to see so many of the products we have of yours contain palm oil. We're now looking at alternatives. Do you have a plan for this?
1897 2018-06-13 20:16:26 gotta do the oil change tomorrow so the car will be ready to drive up to canada
1898 2018-06-13 20:16:26 @Ford Drilling for oil offshore, including Antarctica, is destroying the planet, so you guys should probably weave solar collectors into your frames to help the battery and preserve gas.
1899 2018-06-13 20:16:24 Try vitamin E oil or cream! It works on any type of scars.
1900 2018-06-13 20:16:23 I think that i'm quickly coming to thr conclusion from watching the guys like yourself that cash is king and with Oil where it is they should be generating a lot here. #RPT added to that the free float is ~13% off of the top of my head.
1901 2018-06-13 20:16:20 What gets me, we live right by an oil refinery and it's 4 pence cheaper a litre 26 miles away. How does that work?

1904 2018-06-13 20:15:56 Wishing you a speedy recovery. You need cannabis oil not surgical.
1905 2018-06-13 20:15:48 Check your Engine oil this morning.
1906 2018-06-13 20:15:43 Oil on board is certainly a challenge for me. I guess this is a study
1907 2018-06-13 20:15:40 Oil majors ask judge to reject New York City climate lawsuit
1908 2018-06-13 20:15:37 So lets break the oil deals eith Japan and Russia and keep our oil to sell in the US. It would be a win - win.
1909 2018-06-13 20:15:35 My coconut oil melted  imma put it in da freezer 
1910 2018-06-13 20:15:20 twirled up baby hairs + coconut oil for the day
1911 2018-06-13 20:15:18 Unfortunately I don't  shea butter and coconut oil has blocked my shine. But then again I don't have such a huge ass 
1912 2018-06-13 20:15:13 Unfortunately, Trump has the GOP coffers and Russian oil money for his defense.
1913 2018-06-13 20:15:12 FYI the majority of our imported oil comes from Canada.
1914 2018-06-13 20:15:00 Coz people nowadays have been reduced to a commodity, just like water or oil, to turn on and off, to push from pillar to post. 
A resource like any other, a human resource; mere functionaries to use, abuse and profit from.
1915 2018-06-13 20:14:54 Ass taste like ass  but when she puts coconut oil on it  boom Almond Joy 
1916 2018-06-13 20:14:54 Tried tea tree oil?
1917 2018-06-13 20:14:45 Charlie, your right n your wrong. Right abt oil n 9.11 but wrong abt regional power. D #Iranians r waging multiple wars 2 control d region. I think its better w the Saudis. U can make Saudis (gradually) change their ways, but not the Iranians. I dont care what @JohnKerry says.
1918 2018-06-13 20:14:43 finally gona get my baby an oil change after 8 months 
1919 2018-06-13 20:14:33 You can sell people anything if you make them believe it's healthy. My boyfriend showed me a psuedomedical science page where they tell you to rinse your mouth with coconut oil after brushing your teeth. The list of benefits was just things that happen from brushing your teeth.
1920 2018-06-13 20:14:31 Tuscany village: at least three olive and wine farms within 10 minutes of walk, yet the olive oil and vinegar in the kitchen are from remote city supermarket. Why certain people prefer transactions?

1922 2018-06-13 20:14:13 If we're doling out tofu tips, may I also recommend: 

-agedashi tofu

-ma po tofu 

-silken tofu with soy sauce + sesame oil + green onions + fried shallots on top

-egg tofu

-fried tofu w/peanut sauce
1923 2018-06-13 20:13:38 The real tipping point will be when we have the next oil price spike, and with this crazy president, we will.
1924 2018-06-13 20:13:32 Couldn't be that your tearing up the Iran deal is destabilizing the middle east, thereby raising oil prices.   Or, maybe it's just your dancing partners in Saudi Arabia just gave you the shaft.
1925 2018-06-13 20:13:27 Oh my I’ve never tried lip oil

1929 2018-06-13 20:13:10 Why are you so upset? There is an essential oil for that
1930 2018-06-13 20:13:02 The central bank is going in for a $grab! Oil CO'S are doing the same. Anytime people get extra $ in pocket the greedy big corps grab it from our hands. These big corps just cut tax cuts but are pressuring congress to allow flood of cheap labor into country so wages don't rise!
1931 2018-06-13 20:12:59 You know the blue spots support all the Red with farm cattle and oil subsidies but many red states turning purple and eventually blue. Blue is a nice color.
1932 2018-06-13 20:12:47 You mean like fighting non-stop wars in oil rich countries and then wonder why they burn our Presidents in effigy?
1933 2018-06-13 20:12:47 Well, that...and maybe a little bit of CBD oil.

1938 2018-06-13 20:12:22 i mean this is the woman who floated the idea of taking libya's oil to cover the cost of the various missiles and bombs used to destroy their country

1940 2018-06-13 20:11:56 Tune up and oil change done, and my car is running smooth!! 
1941 2018-06-13 20:11:54 You need to lean on OPEC Mr President or how about this STOP BUYING THEIR OIL! You said we, as a nation, are exporting it. With fracking in full swing our gas prices should be half of what they are.
1942 2018-06-13 20:11:53 Lawd, oil changes be that serious!? Lol

1946 2018-06-13 20:11:14 my doctor had a "healthy" fat chart on his wall with vegetable oil on top....I tore it down 2 visits ago...
1947 2018-06-13 20:11:11 You bring down oil to $40bucks! It would help small business & the middle class, almost as much as the TAX reduction did! $10 a day savings
1948 2018-06-13 20:10:56 In order to MAGA we need an inspirational leader, not a narcissistic bully! So as long as you’re in the WH, we’ll never ever have MAGA! America needs honest, hard working leadership that work FOR the ppl not oil barrons & Corps.
1949 2018-06-13 20:10:30 Dear Mr. Rubio it has been 20 years of destruction in the backyard of the US, using US$ out oil sales to the US. Please activate the oil embargo, and you’ll see Maduro’s regime implode in few hours. Corruption is the energy of this Regime, no $$= The End

In a pinch just throw in some seasame oil and soy sauce. Or if you haven’t washed the pan yet, fry an egg if you have one? Over easy onto rice is great with a bit of soy sauce

1957 2018-06-13 20:10:03 “Does anyone have a longer dipstick? Mine doesn’t reach the oil anymore” LMAOOOOOO
1958 2018-06-13 20:09:54 Use less oil... don't paint ya nails... get a lil crust on ya
1959 2018-06-13 20:09:50 Actually it's more about for you and your baby that you should be concerned I've run my time the things that Donald is doing affect you and your baby for many many years Scott Pruitt who was paid for by the oil companies can dump anything they want anywhere should frighten you

1963 2018-06-13 20:09:28 Petrochemicals?  Way to pick an industry to invest in that's better for the environment than oil.  Probably smart though, pretty much every nation on Earth that has the industry would like to find some sucker country to move it to.
1964 2018-06-13 20:09:28 Electric cars only do so much when most of our electricity is made via fossil fuels. The only way to be energy dependent is to switch to nuclear for electricity and use renewables for supplemental power, but the oil companies has made it taboo.
1965 2018-06-13 20:09:08 When Chuck Bass told Serena Van Der Woodsen “How about a good cheese with truffle oil? You do love truffles” it completely went over my jss 3 head.
1966 2018-06-13 20:09:02 Hmmm....Maybe Trump wants higher oil prices  or maybe he has already profited from higher oil prices......
1967 2018-06-13 20:08:50 my family eats alheira  on the daily ,

honeslty how dont they die from heart attack??? 
its literally worse then eat macdonals everyday for dinner
1968 2018-06-13 20:08:27 Canada is our largest oil partner with them sending 99% of their vast supply to the US.  Your stupidity and alienating our chief ally is bizzare, and stupid.  You are an idiot.
1969 2018-06-13 20:08:24 Salmon roe tastes like cod liver oil to me
1970 2018-06-13 20:08:12 So I think it's technically illegal, but I don't believe it's enforced since CBD doesn't have any THC in it. You can buy it online really easily. The oil helps more with chronic pain and medical conditions and the rubs are more localised. It's helped my back a lot.
1971 2018-06-13 20:08:03 There are people who will be born and will never know there was a time we did makeup using petroleum jelly to slick eyebrows, black eye pencil as lip liner and pink oil and water to slick down our edges. That time before highlighting and contouring and edge control
1972 2018-06-13 20:08:02 No amount of recycling, no conservation at all will offset the distruction done by appointing a spokesman for the oil companies to EPA chief.
1973 2018-06-13 20:07:59 And what does it change? You are merely arguing on the semantics of Sanders' language trying to catch him in a GOTCHA as though that will prove Clinton is completely innocent of not having taking big $ from the fossil fuels industry. Yes or no, did Clinton get millions from Oil?

1976 2018-06-13 20:07:25 How does an increase in gas prices cut into GDP? Plus, oil prices would need to approach $100 for a significant period of time before any real impact occurs. And Q2 GDP is tracking above 4.5%, why is 5% suddenly inconceivable? Consumer confidence is sky high and employment is up.
1977 2018-06-13 20:07:25 i wanna get in the shower, wash my hair, get out the shower, put on some grape seed oil, & let someone rub my scalp

"We've warned you before" said the droid. 

Apparently machines can be haters (not enough oil on the gears).
1983 2018-06-13 20:06:56 Oil prices are rising because the twittiot in chief continues to threaten trade wars with our allies, seemingly oblivious to reality; the US won't win a trade war, there are no prizes.
1984 2018-06-13 20:06:52 You’d better thank America.  We are a large part of the reason you are not speaking German right now.

STOP EATING OIL

Do Not Imflame The Brain

Oil & water do not mix..Oil is NOT a soluble

Oil traps toxins, salts & sugars in the blood

It becomes thick & sluggish blocking oxygen & unhydrates the brain

STOP ALL OIL, fish, olive, corn,

DRINK LOTS of WATER
1999 2018-06-13 20:05:27 In a peak oil production scenario, HS train will look better. HS tickets on D trains are probably under priced, as they sell out soon. Finances could improve, as it seems tickets are priced below peag revenue. Also, the train utilization is near zero at night time.
2000 2018-06-13 20:05:20 Why do oil changes take foreverrr
2001 2018-06-13 20:05:12 Regressive mentality? They're doing what most would do in their situation. The Saudi-imposed Hadi regime would play to the interests of foreign oil vultures at the expense of the greater Yemeni people. Stop with the Saudi propaganda.
2002 2018-06-13 20:04:58 CBD oil is legal in all 50 states for humans. However, in vet medicine in NYS it’s a controlled substance. My vet told me she could lose her license for recommending or discussing dosages with me. My 13 y/o cat has outlived their 2-3 month lymphoma prognosis because of it though.

Please resign soon. Thank you.

I fear only when it’s too late :(
2020 2018-06-13 20:02:36 vegan but not cruelty free! ie. mcdonalds fries are vegan cause they’re fried in separate oil as well, but since you’re still giving money to mcds its not cruelty free

2022 2018-06-13 20:01:38 I have to disagree with you here. Society, organizations, corporations etc. have this right when fundamentally opposes what they stands for.

Can we expect B'nai Birth to hire someone who sides w/Hamas? Oil Co. w/Greenpeace supporter? Is it fair to cry discrimination then?
2023 2018-06-13 20:01:36 Ok. That's crazy. I know people who've bought cbd oil which also has trace thc levels from a company called lovecbd, pefectly legally and they are based in the uk. They market the oil as having the 'entourage effect' as cbd and thc work better together.

2049 2018-06-13 19:58:04 Actually soy bean oil industry preceded the soy meal industry by 20 to 30 years. Increases in soy bean oil consumption increased cuz it was a lot cheaper & more profitable. So soy bean oil largely replaced animal fats b4 soy meal became major source of feed primarily  4 chickens
2050 2018-06-13 19:58:00 ... Can't live without oil, the infra isn't there for us to live without it yet, slowly, energy transition usually takes 50 yrs, big dollars involved, trillions, few companies r going to dump what they have overnight especially critical infra, they make chgs measure in decades...
2051 2018-06-13 19:57:51 LOL

Actually, this is one of the recipes from the chef. It’s inspired (not joking) by her grandma, who died of lung cancer and used to cook mashed potatoes with bacon for him. It has a potato foam, maltodextrin with smoked oil, and crumbled bacon, and served in an steel ashtray
2052 2018-06-13 19:57:40 In my opinion (take it or leave it) you just need someone to cook it for you in a way that tastes good. If you’re getting your kale at PCC salad bar, that could be part of the problem. If you like to cook, try pan-charring it with coconut oil, himalayan salt, garlic and paprika

@scquib22 you're incredible
2062 2018-06-13 19:56:57 I can picture the discussion in the 1880s as newspapers start saying that "oil is the new coal" and academics, whom I picture with solid beards and much better dressed than us, roll their eyes and say "NOOOOOO".

2087 2018-06-13 19:54:05 BamBam will be very successful. She so talented and also very hard working. What can she not do, sing, act, present, speak etc. Also her oil is now in over 10 countries yet she makes no noise and BamTeddy fans are so mature. Team no noise #BBNaija
2088 2018-06-13 19:54:04 Hair needs aloe gel and argan oil
2089 2018-06-13 19:53:57 BUT, we really need to diversify our market for oil/gas! #cdnpoli
2090 2018-06-13 19:53:55 Once set in motion these things tend to accelerate exponentially. The sheer number of ppl able and willing to contribute to hard/software development is enormous
2091 2018-06-13 19:53:52 You know, I force myself to watch FOX news periodically to see what the right is saying.  But I can't watch your show.  You truly make me feel sick.  I'll never understand why you, Hannity and Carlson have sold your souls.  Watching you is like drinking a bottle of castor oil!
2092 2018-06-13 19:53:50 115k a year?!?! I need to take my ass to the oil field ASAP
2093 2018-06-13 19:53:39 Find Oil, dril for Oil, transport Oil, refine Oil, trandsport gas... Gas:$1.23 per Litre.

Raise cow, ship cow, process meat... Beef Jerky:  $6.21 per 100g.

Price fixing of meat snacks is a conspiracy of global proportions! 

#TheTruthIsOutThere
2094 2018-06-13 19:53:14 well if you rejoined the Iran deal, that was working just fine , and stopped sanctions  oil prices would fall again but your boss would lose out on his oil revenue cut so you wont will you?
2095 2018-06-13 19:53:13 No no no, you got it all wrong. You need to marinate BEFORE you go home. I recommend olive oil and/or butter
2096 2018-06-13 19:53:07 I thought lithium was the new oil? Cobalt is the new new oil. Basically, they mostly seem to have compiled some USGS data.
2097 2018-06-13 19:53:00 Bruh I was dying in class bc this girl presenting kept pronouncing “alveoli” olive oil  I couldn’t stop laughing
2098 2018-06-13 19:52:32 Take example of her oil, she now has distributors in different African country, doesn't that show she's an influencer.
2099 2018-06-13 19:52:21 Hasn't Germany just done a deal for oil and gas with Russia shutting out rest of Eu.
2100 2018-06-13 19:52:20 @JMV1070 I love the CBD oil. Helps me sleep and I kicked an 18 year chew habit w that stuff.  I love it.
2101 2018-06-13 19:52:15 Thanks Uncle Oil. I don't know about that. I'm just blaggin it, as usual
2102 2018-06-13 19:52:11 Ooh sounds nice. How will you entice families to come in, do you think. I could imagine (if that was me) setting up a lovely space with gorgeous books, baked treats, chilled music, oil burner...and no families...or is that just me? 
2103 2018-06-13 19:51:54 Ifb
2104 2018-06-13 19:51:53 Yup I agree. I'm an advocate for exploring the healing properties of mj particularly the cannabis oil
2105 2018-06-13 19:51:53 We know Chauncey HePussy got argan oil and rhinestones
2106 2018-06-13 19:51:52 Hello Daniel. I'll pass that this is not any manifesto that was shared or circulated by the APC. But if you check #6 for example YOU claim APC/Buhari intended to stabilize global oil prices at $100. Please share a link that we can verify this because even common sense disagrees.
2107 2018-06-13 19:51:51 I'm eyeing domestic E&Ps in 2H 2018. Trump tweet hints that OPEC not playing ball, higher oil prices and Permian players will benefit even more from ramp in production. I still think there's many undervalued names out there. $XOP
2108 2018-06-13 19:51:45 Oil money speaking!
2109 2018-06-13 19:51:44 HERESY! Long live peanut-oil-fried chicken (and peach shakes)!
I'm also here for the ratio.
2110 2018-06-13 19:51:37 Grab him, beat him up, steal his money, dump him inside an oil refinery in Moonachie.
2111 2018-06-13 19:51:37 @realDonaldTrump, @GOPLeader @SpeakerRyan You wanna solve the opioid addiction issue, stop passing pill bans & provide actual pain relief for people. Wake up! people need pain relief. How about CBD oil access, how about making POT Legal & growable for pain relief. Pot doesnt kill
2112 2018-06-13 19:51:18 You could apply almond oil around your eyes it worked for me
2113 2018-06-13 19:51:10 Acceleration to cut labor costs is undeniable.
Forward looking business sees various things.
Like new FICA like taxes to fund social justice.
2114 2018-06-13 19:51:02 Just got told by @Lowes that my @TroyBilt mower I bought in October of last year seized due to improper lubrication so they don't cover the repair and want to charge me more than the cost of the mower to repair it. I put oil in it in March and have cut the grass 4-5 times since
2115 2018-06-13 19:51:02 The hash oil put me to bed...the colorado shit had me napping on my hardwood floor...my weednap game is top notch
2116 2018-06-13 19:50:59 Oh, stop. You love it when oil and any other fossil fuel goes up - it's good for the wallets of you and your cronies. You have been pushing oil and coal since the beginning, and then left the Iran deal. YOU are to blame.
2117 2018-06-13 19:50:28 So why did you shutdown domestic oil exploration under Obama? wE told you that may times and Obama said he wanted gas at $5.00 per gallon!  Hypocrites, all of the dem complaining now!
2118 2018-06-13 19:50:28 No such thing as a Democrat turning down money .
2119 2018-06-13 19:50:21 Only problem is that your actions are not hurting @realDonaldTrump but his people, if he even thinks of the US citizens as "his people".
The only way to get the idiot's attention is to boycott his own business and cut off the oil supply to US.
2120 2018-06-13 19:50:12 Wanna know whats for dinner? Well our meals usually consist of beans, lentils, oil, salt pork, cheese, dried fish and some milk and meat towards the beginning of the vogage so not too tough guessing ;) #saveme #wantrealfood If I eat another biscuit imma barf 
2121 2018-06-13 19:50:11 That “God” looks like the guy who changes my oil at Spiffy Lube....
2122 2018-06-13 19:50:10 You caused this, little Donnie dotard, by withdrawing from the Iran agreement - here’s an idea - why don’t you tell your buddies in American oil companies to use their huge tax breaks to reduce gas prices?
2123 2018-06-13 19:50:10 So much respect for consistent oil traders; makes trading currency and bonds look like kid games
2124 2018-06-13 19:50:09 Katy, I don’t know u but thank u for listening to me talk for an hour about all of my problems while getting my oil changed 
2125 2018-06-13 19:49:53 People that work in the oil field are funny as shit
2126 2018-06-13 19:49:46 So, lithium is the new oil... soon the new gold.
2127 2018-06-13 19:49:46 Seriously? He complains about oil and gas prices after decreasing mandates for car companies for gas mileage. Wow. I would be amazed at his stupidity if it didn't affect the while country.
2128 2018-06-13 19:49:39 Lavender has magical calming powers. Here are some ways to use it:

⁕ fill a diffuser with lavender essential oil
⁕ infuse a little into a chia pudding
⁕ dab it on your pillow before bed
2129 2018-06-13 19:49:29 My dogs and my cat do this! I put coconut oil on the dog's nosies in the winter so they don't dry out and they think it's a treat.
2130 2018-06-13 19:49:26 I may have underestimated the course I have an exam of tomorrow. I'll be burning the midnight oil for sure.
2131 2018-06-13 19:49:22 Yeah, well he neglected to tell you the whole story how in case the trade is not fair to Canada either.  You get our oil at cut rate prices and lumber. Yeah he forgot the other side.
2132 2018-06-13 19:49:19 Nuts , peanut butter , olive oil , avocado, coconut milk .. it was grey 
2133 2018-06-13 19:49:09 石油だってオリーブオイルだって変わらぬオイルだ。だからみんな、資源は大切に使おう。
2134 2018-06-13 19:49:01 Michael made dinner lastnight we had some bomb fajita tacos, he fixed the speakers in my car, did an oil change, and loves hanging out with my niece! If he’s not a keeper  I don’t know what is 
2135 2018-06-13 19:48:44 I work oil.  Prices are fine.  Taxes on gas are the problem.   We need to keep oil between 60-75$ for us to keep our jobs.  Don’t kill our jobs like obama killed coal.
2136 2018-06-13 19:48:43 Agree about the drones.  Also, please stop voting in favor of your donors, the oil and gas industry, because they are a major factor in destroying our climate, which, in turn, harms our forests (not to mention our air and water).  Facts matter to most of us.
2137 2018-06-13 19:48:39 Exactly what happened during the oil downturn in Alberta. All those oil companies started automating jobs and a lot of workers got cut. Now oil is making a small comeback, but those jobs? Never coming back.
2138 2018-06-13 19:48:39 Ordering ahead is the coming thing. No waiting
2139 2018-06-13 19:48:34 am I the only one that does a weird jump back every time i chuck some chips in the fryer bc i don’t wanna get burnt from the oil splashing at u lmao
2140 2018-06-13 19:48:28 Waiting for an oil change and tire rotation at @pepboysauto - props to them for a comfortable waiting room and letting folks use the TV clicker. I appreciate not being forced to listen to blaring bad daytime TV. :)

2143 2018-06-13 19:48:13 Great! Though I hope they restrain themselves from claiming that "cobolt is the new oil" or something like that? :)
2144 2018-06-13 19:48:13 Carbs. Spaghetti with olive oil and Parmesan. Bagels. Ice cream. Take n bake rolls dripping with butter.
2145 2018-06-13 19:48:12 "Your hair isn't naturally curly if you have to put a little bit of oil in it to get it to bounce."
I don't know, is your hair naturally straight if you have to put in conditioner and then brush it? It's not like I'm using a curling iron.
2146 2018-06-13 19:47:58 As long as the Cowardly GOP sense they have ONE LAST VOTE TO glean off this Snake  Oil Salesman, they won't budge. May they ALL  Meet A MOST DREADFUL KARMA JUSTICE!!
2147 2018-06-13 19:47:57 Trying THC free CBC oil for my anxiety and I’m excited 
2148 2018-06-13 19:47:53 I think olive oil make my scalp itchy fast
2149 2018-06-13 19:47:51 I love your Alaska Oil Money
2150 2018-06-13 19:47:49 Gave a bearded man a facial today and ended it with a beard oil..and I can genuinely say that I can definitely see myself doing that more often 
2151 2018-06-13 19:47:48 Been using soapwort since then, and I love it. My skin is a lot calmer, and seems more resilient. I perhaps need to use a tiny bit extra oil to moisturise, but that makes sense as I'm not using it to cleanse.  Gonna stick with this as an application method, it's pretty simple
2152 2018-06-13 19:47:46 Pulling you toward the king sized bed that they rarely use he grins. “Lay down on your stomach please...if your comfortable with it that is.” He spoke quickly not wanting to ruin the relaxed mood. “I have some massage oil in the nightstand.”
2153 2018-06-13 19:47:43 I don't know what went wrong for him but I think it was when he moved to Inter from Porto. Quaresma was supposed to be the new crude oil after Ronaldinho. 
He's a joy to watch when he was at Porto.
2154 2018-06-13 19:47:42 I meant turpentine oil
2155 2018-06-13 19:47:37 ..........oil?
2156 2018-06-13 19:47:30 Think Globalism, shift from industrial to service, trade issues prob now? 
Even tech recognizes the coming storm. 
Solutions vary, consensus is in but intentionally kept on down low.
2157 2018-06-13 19:47:21 Relax, Bradley; maybe shop for more beard oil.
2158 2018-06-13 19:47:19 Getting splashed in the face with hot oil is...
2159 2018-06-13 19:47:16 No. Current oil prices have nothing to do with Obama.
2160 2018-06-13 19:47:16 Here’s a list of things that will happen before I get a text back:

•Water and oil mix together properly
 
•Tom and Jerry being actual friends

•Scar will becoming King of Pride Rock

•Destiny’s Child getting back together
 
•Hell freezing over

2163 2018-06-13 19:46:57 I’ve been here for two hours waiting on an oil change
2164 2018-06-13 19:46:53 @MaltesersUK to bad my favorite chocolate is with Palm oil!! So no more maltesers for me #palmoil
2165 2018-06-13 19:46:53 I don't think whoring yourself out for a story is the same as dating.
2166 2018-06-13 19:46:50 Not true!
He promised free electricity, free water, free oil for all people!
Some lazy-ass people got happy and with the help of trained militants they captured military posts and got their hands on weapons then end of story!
2167 2018-06-13 19:46:47 I need some cbd oil
2168 2018-06-13 19:46:42 It’s running out you dopey bastard. They can charge what the hell they like. It’s called supply and demand. A more sensible quest would be one concerned with renewable energy. That will become apparent when the oil runs out and the planet is on its arse, I suppose.
2169 2018-06-13 19:46:40 the ingredients for these potato chips say "specially selected potatoes" and now I want a narrative of every item, "vegetable oil we got from jerry's cousin", "paprika from the batch tony tried to smell and passed out from"
2170 2018-06-13 19:46:29 منحة /شورى /

2172 2018-06-13 19:46:21 A combination of lemon, peppermint, and lavender diluted with fractioned coconut oil. He runs in on the back of his neck and on his neck below/under his ears a few times a day.
2173 2018-06-13 19:46:18 why does it cost so much to be alive?? like i will go so long without spending money then blow $200 in a day on an oil change and a few groceries 
2174 2018-06-13 19:46:17 it's not my opinion? it's facts? marijuana toxicity is a REAL THING. YES canine/feline cbd oil can help with many things but it is different than ingesting whole ass nugs or their owners pot brownies
2175 2018-06-13 19:46:09 Hahahaha “Trust me this snake oil works!” @MSNBC @wolfblitzer
2176 2018-06-13 19:46:09 Maksud saya, jadi kan Hemp Seed Oil ini lagi hype hanget di dunia perskincarean banyak youtuber luar yang merekomendasikan Hemp Seed Oil ini, yang saya mau tanyakan kalau kita di Indonesia ini terus membeli Hemp Seed Oil itu apakah boleh? atau mungkin kita bakalan ditangkap gitu?

WAIT FIR UT TO HIT OVER 100USD then U resell.

2179 2018-06-13 19:45:56 Rub the ribs in some rib rub, Worcestershire sauce and olive oil. Let them marinate overnight. Grill them for 1 hour on each side OR crockpot for about 4 hours, then put them in the oven on broil for 30 min.
2180 2018-06-13 19:45:32 The best part of my day is when I have guys who have never changed their own oil trying to tell me how to fix a car
2181 2018-06-13 19:45:31 out of all the tips and tricks for trying to make a baby come early, i’m trying nipple stimulation cause ain’t no way in hell imma swallow some damn castor oil

2197 2018-06-13 19:43:35 You people how you love god and trump.  Oil and vinegar don’t mix.  I feel so sorry for how trump has penetrated the fabric of many lives.  What are your plans when the truth finally dawns on you.  Rational is out the window at your house.
2198 2018-06-13 19:43:34 Oil barrel
2199 2018-06-13 19:43:32 I feel that stress.  I have found cbd oil immensely helpful with anxiety, depression, and pain management.  Do recommend!  Sublingual delivery has given me the most lasting effect.
2200 2018-06-13 19:43:28 Oil change
2201 2018-06-13 19:43:27 My dog came in while I was shaving my legs and started licking the coconut oil off of my legs. On one hand, he’s so precious and sweet I want to die. On the other, he’s forcing me to use more coconut oil when I’m broke.
2202 2018-06-13 19:43:25 Should you put coconut oil on dry or wet hair?
2203 2018-06-13 19:43:09 Big oil just sitting on old pivot 66.81, I have no trade ideas on it at all, small ball at best. Trade something else til a chaos factor shows up. $UWT $DWT $USO
2204 2018-06-13 19:43:07 We need all Canada’s oil, supplied by Canada.  No more OPEC oil, and no more OPEC funded protests, (Greenpeace)
2205 2018-06-13 19:43:07 This is our chance. The future of the Arctic Refuge is about to be decided. Join me and @TheWCS to say "Absolutely no drilling for oil and gas in the Arctic Refuge" http://1/#.WyFzvQoI7Dc.twitter
2206 2018-06-13 19:43:04 SO is anybody still oil pulling
2207 2018-06-13 19:42:44 noah fence but if you clear skin bitches give me skin care advice and tell me that you slather your face in coconut oil everyday i WILL laugh in your face
2208 2018-06-13 19:42:32 And if the oil price falls again we'll likely have a minus 2% and then they are yelling -deflation- again like it's the judgement day. Not surprizing, given the big portion energy makes up in the basket of goods !
Stop that energy speculation ! As simple as that.

2209 2018-06-13 19:42:30 The guy at the oil change place told me how long it’s been since my last visit, and asked me if I’d been going somewhere else. 

I lied and told him I had been.
2210 2018-06-13 19:42:30 I’m only 3,000 miles past when I was supposed to change my oil... I mean, how important can it be anyways 
2211 2018-06-13 19:42:25 I've heard a lot of mixed things about the logisitics of soccer in Lucas Oil Stadium. Some from FO, some from within my SG. But the main thing that keeps coming up is that it isn't up to par with FIFA regulations. HOWEVER, that isn't to say it isn't possible.
2212 2018-06-13 19:42:18 Cordelia is a spoiled brat.  If I didn’t depend on her so much she would’ve waited for her spa day.  Now I have to wait while she gets a new battery, coolant flush, cabin air filter change, and oil change.  Thanks Cordy, not like I had to go to work today

2219 2018-06-13 19:41:43 I used shaving cream for the first time in years and let me tell you, what a scam that is. Conditioner or coconut oil is MILES better.
2220 2018-06-13 19:41:40 Dabs are like a sledgehammer to me. But I have a hash oil pen, and I like it better than smoking.
2221 2018-06-13 19:41:28 Five day old pasta bolognese that’s been microwaved in a plastic bowl that has orange oil baked into the sides of it served with Texas toast from school lunches paired with a tiny Dixie cup of flat Diet Sierra Mist
2222 2018-06-13 19:41:11 The guy selling hemp oil soap is totes ridiculous. Stay on ‘em guys.
2223 2018-06-13 19:40:59 Sooo free thinker?
2224 2018-06-13 19:40:53 I’m in oil and gas and when you toss shit like this out, I@ sure it plays to your uneducated base; however, like most things that come out of your mouth, it’s BS. You are intellectually on par with a two year old. Worthless
2225 2018-06-13 19:40:46 @GrassleyPress Please remove your CBD oil amendment.  It'll impact many autism families who've had tremendous results. Please get more information, its not a schedule 1, its a life saver. My 10 yr old daughter can focus, use sign language and improved behavior since using CBD

2227 2018-06-13 19:40:27 Snapbacks and girls mix like oil and water.. they don’t.
2228 2018-06-13 19:40:16 Naked covered in coconut oil watching the rain from my bed surrounded by windows and listening to uzi do I HAVE to go to work
2229 2018-06-13 19:40:16 いや…ちょ、やめろっ！耳からはさすがに油飲めないから！
2230 2018-06-13 19:40:11 Isn’t all that stuff paid for by North Sea oil? Or shouldn’t that be pointed out?
2231 2018-06-13 19:39:43 The WTI crude going straight from $66.05 to $66.78 a good 73 pips increase. The U.S showing the drop in Oil inventory by 4.4 million barrels reaching to March level again. But at current hour the bounce back of dollars is yet not seen which is still at 67.53 currently. Trade safe
2232 2018-06-13 19:39:38 Hot oil has gotten on my glasses...!
2233 2018-06-13 19:39:37 Don't forget vehicle maintenance now summer is here, check levels, oil, screen wash, coolant and also give vehicles a good wash and wax to preserve bodywork in the hot sun #suffolkhour
2234 2018-06-13 19:39:28 Oil prices always go up in summer!
2235 2018-06-13 19:39:24 It's not that at all, it just gave Thumper and his oil stock holding buddies an opportunity to raise the price of fuel, then blame it on Iran.  I think Thumper was actually overheard saying to his cronies,"I blamed it on OPEC and Americans are so dumb they bought it. Fools"
2236 2018-06-13 19:39:21 Mom, Shebs and you deep into the woods so you obviously need tick protection. Are you still using topical? I only use a mix of apple cider vinegar, lavender oil and distilled water in a spray bottle for the boys. It works for tick and fleas, but we stay off forests...
2237 2018-06-13 19:39:16 The big oil companies and governments that receive monetary payment from them will never change because they are getting rich at the environments expense.  Until we elect responsible government officials with the fortitude to do their job with integrity we will continue this way.
2238 2018-06-13 19:38:59 Except Sanford lost and he was one of the only members of @GOP actually trying to cut spending, repeal ACA, and deliver on the promises... yet he lost because he bashed Trump. GOP base is no longer policy driven - it is personality driven.
2239 2018-06-13 19:38:53 ummm..OPEC? Try you scrapping the Iran deal. It's funny how when a so called Republican is in office, or gas prices rise. Gaming the system maybe? Or just letting the oil companies take a piece from the American people to line their pockets?

I'm gonna sleep like a baby 
2243 2018-06-13 19:38:40 @lorenbouchard This may seem bizarre, but have you ever seen David Lynch’s “Rabbits”? I had it on in the background while working and a portion of it sounded similar to “Oil Spill”.
2244 2018-06-13 19:38:34 The US has an army right?? Instead of sending them overseas to protect (invade)a country that doesn't want them there in the first place (oil), send them home to eradicate every last one of these animals. That's the war they should be fighting.
2245 2018-06-13 19:38:30 He was working as an ambassador for an oil company when my brother was an apprentice electrician in the 90’s, my bro had to go and change a lightbulb in his office, Big Mickey P harvested him with his eyes the whole time he was working! #TopMan
2246 2018-06-13 19:38:30 what they wanted was to shake up tory governments in the pocket off the city & to get support for the areas thatcher destroyed with her deindustrialisation and promote the city policies blindly followed by subsequent governments that lacked the scottish oil bonanza she frittered
2247 2018-06-13 19:38:27 they didn’t even put oil on it after and i know for sur that that nigga scalp gon itch like shit ://
2248 2018-06-13 19:38:25 When your oil change be $150 I think to myself what else could I have bought w/ these coins 
2249 2018-06-13 19:38:24 Hmmm maybe scrapping the Iran nuke deal was a bad idea? Oh well, Putin is making boatloads of money from this “screwup” or was the oil price increase part of his plan all along?
2250 2018-06-13 19:38:23 He may be leaving in handcuffs.

Schadenfreude and karma are foreign words and oh so much for the better when they apply to this oil slick of a man.

2254 2018-06-13 19:37:43 I think these are the most hypocritical, antithetical, dochotomous statements of left. 
Slurring 1 individual, then in nxt segment discussing who will clean toilets, pick fruit. 
Argument of a slave owner.
2255 2018-06-13 19:37:25 You're a tool of oil companies. A prostitute. Just go away. You don't serve anybody except your donors.
2256 2018-06-13 19:37:19 Chabils been having my car since 9a.. it’s going on 3 and they still not done. All i wanted was an oil change
2257 2018-06-13 19:37:14 Peterson throws out catchy quotes & obscure histories & oblique allusions & mythical stories & bits of scientific research, etc., and then stitches it all into a slick narrative that just happens to support his proto-fascistic worldview. He’s a dangerous snake oil salesman.
2258 2018-06-13 19:37:10 @RealJim @thenewsjunkie @RussRollins @ToTheTopCarlos @ItsOffcialAngel @JimTheDirty @SabrinaAmbra Please help spread the word about Sen Grassley amendment to block CBD oil. My autistic daughter uses it and has had tremendous results. We must block this amendment from passing!
2259 2018-06-13 19:37:05 Which goals?

Buying new ships to your children carrying oil to Israel 

Selling all public institutiones to foreigners to soften the coming big economic crisis

Helping int'l terror groups by intel service

2289 2018-06-13 19:34:26 This good oil 
2290 2018-06-13 19:33:55 You must shout to your friends Russia and Saudi Arabia! They have agreed to slow oil production to keep the price of oil high.
2291 2018-06-13 19:33:55 I think there’s a video on it. He ate something from the snack bar and he thinks someone used the spoon for something else containing peanut oil.
2292 2018-06-13 19:33:53 Probably just rubbed it in some oil
2293 2018-06-13 19:33:52 How can a soldier fight for his family when he's in the middle east fighting for oil? Doesn't add up.

2302 2018-06-13 19:32:57 With your buddies in Saudi you can't "make a deal" to bring down oil prices? You are gutting this country by taking bribes & making your real deals in back rooms.

Gas prices were low under OBAMA.

2305 2018-06-13 19:32:39 isn't world blood just oil
2306 2018-06-13 19:32:33 If you think Sanders was attacking the ordinary people making a small donation to Clinton who happen to work for an oil company, then good luck with that argument. But it spectacularly misses the point & further more, it shows that no lessons were learnt by Clinton supporters.
2307 2018-06-13 19:32:32 We'll start with Berkley.
2308 2018-06-13 19:32:20 How about considering that oil from Iran is no longer available? Canada is going to cut us off also.  Watch prices.  We know you  caused both of these problems.

2310 2018-06-13 19:31:48 I wanna say if you got oil yourself and a filter, you should come out paying around $60 for it, between materials and paying the shop to do an oil change, total.

2312 2018-06-13 19:31:40 How many more Deep Water Horizon oil spills will it take for people to wake up and stop depending on oil? The Gulf will never be the same. They used Corexit to disperse the oil. It's banned nearly everywhere. Wake up!

2314 2018-06-13 19:31:31 I second this, and I would also like to bring awareness to how dangerous food is. I’m going to protest food indefinitely and live off of water, the sun, and tea tree oil. #woke
2315 2018-06-13 19:31:27 "They" have been telling us for yrs that U.S. is energy independent now & we have "plenty" of oil. Then every time Saudi sneezes our gas prices go up and everyone starts sweating. So, which is it @POTUS, are we or are we not energy independent?

2319 2018-06-13 19:31:15 Are you paying attention? The U.S. put the sanctions in place but the money was not in the U.S. It was mostly in Asian nations who had bought Iranian oil but honored the sanctions and held the money in escrow.
2320 2018-06-13 19:31:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, however decades, so why should we do the same for immigration?

2353 2018-06-13 19:26:34 Ok how does this CDB or CBD or whatever oil work? Will it help me sleep? Will it give me dry mouth? Will it make me gain weight? What does it DO
2354 2018-06-13 19:26:26 This is our chance. The future of the Arctic Refuge is about to be decided. Join me and @TheWCS to say "Absolutely no drilling for oil and gas in the Arctic Refuge" http://1/#.WyFv4K5qaO8.twitter
2355 2018-06-13 19:26:18 Dividends from oil majors back to growth

After reaching $80/bbl we expect the oil price to stabilize to $75 by end of 2019

American oil majors to raise their dividends by 5% in the next 3 years

Shell and BP to lag the sector (flat DPS) in the short term due to higher leve…
2356 2018-06-13 19:26:15 At c and s getting justins truck oil changed and this lady has 3 kids in here and an infant thats like 8 months doing whatever they want and the baby crawling every where  while my kids are being really good!
2357 2018-06-13 19:26:06 Tillerson & Trump had never met so why did Trump name him SS?  Tillerson put the Rosneft oil deal together with Exxon.  If Trump could lift Sanctions on Russia while driving up Iran oil prices with Sanctions he would make lots of money from his puppet master.  Full circle .
2358 2018-06-13 19:25:42 Yemen is on the "outside" of the world and Saudi has too much oil. That means noone cares......

2360 2018-06-13 19:25:33 You realize that the U.S. is a net exporter of oil right? Higher oil prices increase export dollars and reduce the trade deficit. Apparently, that is “not good” today.
2361 2018-06-13 19:25:31 Ohio legislature passes bill to exempt oil and gas producers from sales tax change
2362 2018-06-13 19:25:16 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
2363 2018-06-13 19:25:16 I just changed my brakes, now I got to change the damn oil
2364 2018-06-13 19:24:56 Working in the oil and gas industry for 25 years. It is our main source of income!!!!!!!!!! Which is at an all time low... Rising healthcare will bankrupt us!!!!!!!!! #Middleclass are suffering ..still!!!!!!
2365 2018-06-13 19:24:43 The engine oil won't be replaced in this car until it's rebuilt.
2366 2018-06-13 19:24:26 That doesn't surprise me. I had a beloved Corolla that was my first car. Always got the oil change, repairs & maintenance at a @toyota dealership. Engine was loud & they said no oil in it - no leaks & no way it burned all the oil. Engine blew & corporate wouldn't do anything. 
2367 2018-06-13 19:24:26 Why in the world do oil changes take longer than an hour? 
2368 2018-06-13 19:24:25 I gave up on it. It's 10 minutes of story in every hour.
2369 2018-06-13 19:24:06 Dough: Paul Hollywood's recipe for pita bread, more or less. 250g flour = 2 pizzas.
Sauce: 200g tomatoes, halved and roasted with a little garlic oil/basil oil/both.
Cheese: bog-standard grated mozzarella out of a bag.
VERY hot oven (240C), non-stick baking parchment on the tray.
2370 2018-06-13 19:23:58 "I shot him in the face, twice. Then I wrapped his head in a towel, and I stabbed him in the chest in his heart, so he would bleed out, and I put him in my bathtub and watched him drain. Then I put him in an oil tank with laundry detergent and lye, and I sealed it back up."
2371 2018-06-13 19:23:56 My skin is so freaking oily  I’ll even skip moisturizing in the mornings and you would think I put oil on my face.

2373 2018-06-13 19:23:47 #BelowDeckMed the work hours are insane! I think Adam should work for my company on Oil Tankers. I think he is to sensitive for yacht life. It would be steady hours, 60 days of work 60 days off. Granted he won’t like only 10% woman on the crew.
2374 2018-06-13 19:23:20 Well shit... Have to write a complaint letter to Oil of Olay now and ask 'em what their problem is and why I don't have the permanent 35 jar yet. #ViewFinder #BeautyBeforeAge
2375 2018-06-13 19:23:17 @AntAnstead . Bit rough knocking the driveshaft oil seal in with a rubber mallet on the Lancia Fulvia. Surely a bearing/seal driver of the correct size should have been used to avoid damage????
2376 2018-06-13 19:23:17 Cooking oil?
2377 2018-06-13 19:23:11 We don’t hear it on TV, Senator. We LIVE it. Education funding decimated in our state. Crumbling infrastructure. For profit prisons. Nonprofits competing for ever-decreasing funding. Oil & gas fat cats getting fatter while we suffer. Politicians telling lies to cover it up.
2378 2018-06-13 19:23:05 Yesterday I got some joints dipped in THC oil and rolled in keef and I just don’t know if I can smoke basic joints anymore
2379 2018-06-13 19:22:37 Dark coloured pigs can then have baby oil wiped over them and white pigs have woodflour sprinkled along their backs then brushed off before going in the ring

2381 2018-06-13 19:22:18 You can turn it into a bulletproof coconut charcoal latte by blending some coconut oil into it. Detox while fueling up that brain simultaneously!
2382 2018-06-13 19:22:14 That can only be good, let’s hope Iran and Venezuela get their way at OPEC. Oil infrastructure is the infrastructure of Saudi & US Imperial power as well as NATO/TTIP and climate change. It is such a serious evil that the Congress in the USA passed laws banning pipeline protests
2383 2018-06-13 19:22:12 The truth may be stretched thin, but it never breaks, and it always surfaces above lies, as oil floats on water. —Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra.
2384 2018-06-13 19:22:07 Oh dhdjd I didnt mean to sound rude or anything and I guess there wasnt really any reason to be clearer like that. I just wanted to offer some stuff that has helped me! 

And yeah it makes sense that oil isnt moisturizing, oils are hydrophobic after all
2385 2018-06-13 19:22:01 Everything in politics is starting to look like oil paintings
2386 2018-06-13 19:21:55 Never smoke. Vaporize, capsulize, edible oil, but smoking is bad for the lungs.

Remember Trump, Flynn & Tillerson were working to lift Sanctions on Russia immediately upon taking office.  Congress stopped them.  Iran oil is cheaper than Russian oil unless Iran is Sanctioned.

2390 2018-06-13 19:21:27 Totally! The difference I'm interested in is that oil & gas interests already had a lot of political power to compliment market forces. Scaling up renewables ("killing" NG) means beating that
2391 2018-06-13 19:21:22 It's not Petrol price that was at $140/Barrel, it was crude oil. Koi batao pappu ko @RahulGandhi
2392 2018-06-13 19:21:17 . @VP @POTUS I heard Kim forced pregnant female inmates to about by injecting their uteruses with motor oil.

You all down with that? You've embraced him like you are.
2393 2018-06-13 19:21:04 You need #avon  skin so soft oil. It's brill
2394 2018-06-13 19:20:54 Let’s see, Green Coffee Beans, Sunflower Oil, garcinia cambogia,ECGC, Açaí, Apple Cider Vinegar, Flax Seed Oil....now Black Seed Oil
2395 2018-06-13 19:20:40 Well...they seem nice:((
2396 2018-06-13 19:20:37 has anybody ever used those homemade egg + oil hair masks and do they work?? my hair is dry as fuck and i have no idea how to fix it unless i just stop washing it for weeks which isn't going to happen
2397 2018-06-13 19:20:30 My car needs an oil change 
2398 2018-06-13 19:20:24 One of the benefits of having a pre existing condition...I've never paid for: Gas, car insurance, oil, tune ups, tire care...
2399 2018-06-13 19:20:22 Yes, it's 19th-century theory, impractical in this 'modern' world. Although we do have the economy of over 100 years ago. The gig economy is structured more like an 18th-century economy, & with Amazon & other net companies we have the new Standard Oil Trusts.
2400 2018-06-13 19:20:21 oil sykes cut his hair off and my inner emo heart is breakin
2401 2018-06-13 19:20:20 That has nothing to do with it. Not a Hillary fan at all. Trump is about Trump and cares nothing for anyone else. Hillary ran the worst campaign ever and Trump is a shill and snake oil salesman and fooled all of you. He is dishonest and not fit for the job.
2402 2018-06-13 19:20:20 Cali you really can’t make it up....no more kids just illegals!
No more kids just illegals
2403 2018-06-13 19:20:18 As long as the oil, seeds, fruit, etc isn't GM because of cause that will cause cancer quite quickly.
2404 2018-06-13 19:20:12 You bang your source, you lose any credibility and when your sources is involved in leaking classified information, you are part of the case.
2405 2018-06-13 19:20:05 US crude oil output at all time high levels. Why should OPEC be respectful when these high production levels are in place?
2406 2018-06-13 19:20:04 Imagine choosing between a great governor and an oil tycoon.. 

God is good y'all

2409 2018-06-13 19:19:43 just put so much fake tan oil on my face and now i gotta sit in front of a fan for at least an hour

2412 2018-06-13 19:19:38 Not worrying at all when your working to budgets and trying to bring in 4-5 players. You just worry about your pot of oil money and who you’re gonna jump ship to next.
2413 2018-06-13 19:19:35 So the $ could "collapse" due to other currencies strenght.
Oil would skyrocket n Trump would be powerless over it.
2414 2018-06-13 19:19:22 They’re SO GOOD even with just olive oil and sea salt
2415 2018-06-13 19:19:08 YOU and @realDonaldTrump are clueless!!! We want to go back to 2014 price wars and thousands of #oil workers and hundreds of #oil companies going OUT OF BUSINESS! U.S. producers NEED $65+ #WTI to survive. want to import more? I'm sure Saudi's and Russia would love to sell it $xop
2416 2018-06-13 19:19:05 I had to get my lights changed, gas, an oil change, new windshield wipers, and who knows what else!
2417 2018-06-13 19:19:01 君を揚げたいな…君を炒めたいな…君に僕を絡めたいな…僕は君のそんな存在になりたい。いや、既になってるだろう?
2418 2018-06-13 19:18:57 Wow! We're home free. So, I guess its OK to flare the snot out of associated gas from shale oil wells afterall.
2419 2018-06-13 19:18:44 theres nothing more beautiful than chili oil in ramen broth
2420 2018-06-13 19:18:41 .. Its not OPEC , it has something to do with supply & demand beside political sensitivity, and US oil firms are happy
2421 2018-06-13 19:18:40 Trump has thrown these guys so far under the bus, they might as well change the oil while they're down there (to appropriate a quote from former DNI Clapper's book that was *not* about Trump).
2422 2018-06-13 19:18:27 Taiwan still waiting.
2423 2018-06-13 19:18:20 totally only saw this now  but Sunday Riley is also my jammm, they put out awesome stuff (good genes & UFO oil just to name a couple)
2424 2018-06-13 19:17:58 Build the wall.
2425 2018-06-13 19:17:54 Yeah also in Denmark. and we already have some of the highest taxes on oil in the world. 
Since Trump took office and later backed out of the Iran deal (which Iran fully complied with) the gas prices has risen close to 40 cent per litre. (1.5 $ per gallon)
2426 2018-06-13 19:17:49 Yepper. Russia has already been caught defying sanctions by delivering oil to DPRK. Reportedly, they gave DPRK uranium as well. They, along w/India, are considered part of Asian block (at least a close relative).  This is deep.
2427 2018-06-13 19:17:44 Yes, it is early days and might well be true, but I'm hopeful. Think #Alberta is pursuing a number of alternate projects that might help mitigate #KinderMorgan oil sands impact, but not sure will be enough or in time esp. after 2013 #Calgary flood and others on coasts.
2428 2018-06-13 19:17:41 You think you know because you’ve been brainwashed by the oil companies to believe it’s not possible. Sad really, I feel bad for you.
2429 2018-06-13 19:17:40 I’m going to test this out. I just use babyoil but olive oil will definitely do the trick
2430 2018-06-13 19:17:37 Would anyone be interested in free samples of our amazing body butter, bath bombs, men’s beard oil, etc?! If so let me know plz!
2431 2018-06-13 19:17:32 So what have you done? Stopped using auto, grow your own food, using solar for all your power usage.  Not likely, and neither is the rest of the world, we all energy to live, I've made small changes but know that oil gives CDN a huge advantage if we used/dev wisely
2432 2018-06-13 19:17:30 Oil, vinegar, salt, pepper, sugar, and garlic powder is the main one

Sometimes add mayo or dijon, esp for potato salad.

My mum does one that's oil, lemon juice, garlic, and salt, where she grinds the garlic and salt together with a mortar and pestle first
2433 2018-06-13 19:17:27 I just had my first Beyond Burger yesterday.  The flavor is fantastic - but the oil - my goodness.  Anyway to turn that down a notch or two?
2434 2018-06-13 19:17:15 Peppermint oil is the best!!!
2435 2018-06-13 19:17:08 O nooooo!      Natural remedies,   Lemon grass  oil,   Rosemary,  well claire knows!
2436 2018-06-13 19:17:06 Stupid. Capsaicin is an oil. Little secret, we pro "Chili Heads" know. Cold water, or drinks are useless. Try hot drinks like coffee, cocoa, to stop the burn. Or really warm water. Cold water snaps those pores SHUT. Try it next time you eat something mui picante!!! It works.
2437 2018-06-13 19:17:01 Snake. Oil. Salesman.
2438 2018-06-13 19:16:58 I just paid for a 80$ oil change and my arm just fell off

2444 2018-06-13 19:16:06 Olive oil doesn't have any sugar in it?  Weight isn't determined by calories, its determined by hormones such as insulin, ghrelin etc, which drive hunger, satiation, fat creation and storage.  The foods we eat trigger different amount of those hormones.

2446 2018-06-13 19:15:51 QT is pretty gradual. Short term rates are still relatively low & 4 hikes per year is only 1% annual. Long-term rates are little-changed over the past 5 years. Rising oil might be problematic but overall inflation still below 2% and individual commodities are out of Fed's scope
2447 2018-06-13 19:15:51 Then maybe you shouldn't pick a trade war with Canada?

You know, that nation immediately north of us from which we import more oil than from the entire Persian Gulf region?

#DotardTrump
2448 2018-06-13 19:15:49 I am sure U.S. oil companies are benefiting from the high prices. Traitor Trump, why not criticize them?
2449 2018-06-13 19:15:48 best thing in jalan tar several nights before eid is that so many people are burning the midnight oil to sell out their stocks. i love to see their excited and eager faces when they promote the items. such smiles of people trying to make ends meet, so soft yet struggling 
2450 2018-06-13 19:15:46 How many meals a day do you normally eat, and what do they consistent of, generally?  

Add butter, MCT oil, super-heavy cream, raw milk to your coffee?
2451 2018-06-13 19:15:46 OPEC has NOTHING to do with it. YOU tore up the Iran nuclear deal, YOU moved the US embassy to Jerusalem, and YOU abdicated our influence in the region so that RUSSIA could light the ME on fire, because PUTIN WANTS higher oil prices, you goddamn fool! YOU MADE THIS HAPPEN!
2452 2018-06-13 19:15:44 Tea tree oil is magical for pimples or breakouts just FYI. It's the one thing saving my pizza face
2453 2018-06-13 19:15:38 So you need to be sure and keep Canada and Mexico pissed off because we get a lot of our oil from them.

2461 2018-06-13 19:14:48 They will never legalise it because people are turning to cbd oil instead of the chemicals the doctors ARE allowed to prescribe. The big pharmaceutical companies will suffer, causing a nightmare for..... the government!
2462 2018-06-13 19:14:46 Russia needs higher oil prices because their economy is over-dependent on oil production.
Trump destabilizes the middle east by pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal.
Oil prices rise.
Trump: "Damn that OPEC!"
2463 2018-06-13 19:14:40 It’s their oil. They can charge what the like. A bit like your golf resorts when prices increased after you stole the election.

2480 2018-06-13 19:12:53 Whups, better check with your boss on this one.  Putin/Russia *WANT* oil prices high...their economy depends on it.
2481 2018-06-13 19:12:45 #IcanConfirm that tmx budget won't talk about the progress of our oil
2482 2018-06-13 19:12:43 Nope but my friend works in an oil company.
2483 2018-06-13 19:12:43 I thought you’d fixed the oil prices and brought oil costs down. This whole economics thing is a little trickier to grasp than being a white-shoe con artist isn’t it

2486 2018-06-13 19:12:26 You are right sir oil prices are going too high artificially. OPEC should be punished for these unfair prices.

2492 2018-06-13 19:11:53 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2493 2018-06-13 19:11:50 i.e. Venezuela - EIA now expecting larger declines in both 2018 and 2019 than previously forecasted. The seizure of state oil company PdVSA’s assets in the Caribbean by ConocoPhillips has diminished PdVSA’s ability to continue meeting its export obligations. #OOTT
2494 2018-06-13 19:11:49 Republicans love high oil. Stop pretending to care.
2495 2018-06-13 19:11:48 Of all the narratives I’ve seen of the oil embargo, “the Saudis just loved Palestine so damn much” is definitely one of them.
2496 2018-06-13 19:11:47 dunno wtf there is to be so bullish about...Drumpf gives the peasants a few extra dollars on their meager paychecks & the oil companies take it back in minutes-  #notatenablesituation

2498 2018-06-13 19:11:39 @Billbrowder Dear sir! Recently, PM proposed to strengthen sanctions for peace in Ukraine. The ban on loans to RF and the embargo on Russian oil for 6 months will be the most real tool for forcing Russia to peace.Could you suggest exactly these steps to the PM and the Parliament?
2499 2018-06-13 19:11:30 On that note, I need to change my oil before I go out of town next week 
2500 2018-06-13 19:11:27 yeah, with increased dosage it works like that. the oil she uses is some 42% cbd (cbd+cbda), ~2% CBC and 3.5-4% CBG with 0.17% thc and 2-3% of terps (Pinene,Limonene and Myrcene)
2501 2018-06-13 19:11:23 Getting my oil changed & they’re vacuuming out my car for me & washing all the bug guts off my window & im grateful bc that means i don’t have to do it but also super embrassed bc i haven’t done that in a while 
2502 2018-06-13 19:11:20 Unless we elect democrats to tax oil companies and push unneeded regulations and drilling bans.
2503 2018-06-13 19:11:09 Some commentators were saying Saudis were not “sure” President Trump’s prior tweet was “serious.” My guess is President and Secretary Mnuchin want to be clear on what is important to global economy. An oil shock bad for everyone ( ala 2006 to 2008 mistake by OPEC)
2504 2018-06-13 19:11:08 Try a little coconut oil if you have. Will melt the makeup 
2505 2018-06-13 19:10:54 THATS OK MR TRUMP, THERE  TIME IS COMING, OPEC IS GOING DOWN, WELLS IN THE MIDDLE EAST GOING DRY! AND THEY WILL LOOK TO THE US AND ISREAL FOR OIL.
2506 2018-06-13 19:10:53 Gradual is no longer ambiguous. It means 4 hikes per year. I do fear that, along with QT & rising oil may be too much for our debt laden economy to bear. The Fed doesn’t have a *desire* to slow growth but this has a good shot of doing so once the current surge of activity fades

2508 2018-06-13 19:10:40 What's your recipe for salad dressing? I tend to just use oil, vinegar and salt. Sometimes I'll add dijon mustard and honey.
2509 2018-06-13 19:10:29 Too bad for Trump that Trump University got in legal trouble and went bust. This would have been the perfect time for Trump to dupe all his #MAGA cult followers into buying into his scam. These people will buy anything this snake oil salesman tries to sell.

2513 2018-06-13 19:10:09 I'm not going to disagree with that and it's a good point.
I just don't like the articles trying to put a downer on new technologies because of an "environmental" concern when oil is currently the life blood of our civilization.

2515 2018-06-13 19:10:02 There are so many questions regarding CBD lately! Here is what I think is absolutely important to know! Our oil is organic, non-GMO and extracted using the CO2 method, which makes our oil 100% PURE.  Our hemp is grown in Kentucky, where our company watches our crops very closely.

2522 2018-06-13 19:09:40 Exactly.. When he came to Midland he spoke about oil and gas since that is the way of life here but in Austin he spoke about Renewable Energy.. He speaks out of both sides of his mouth.. No thank you
2523 2018-06-13 19:09:21 @nytimesworld The ole mon can go build a bridge with Kim of North Korea, but can't open his heart to suffering Yemenis. If Bush focused on oil, this bugger is on the greenback alone.

2541 2018-06-13 19:07:55 When traveling to humid climate:

Switch to a lightweight moisturizer with SPF.

Have your oil control wipes and dab the excess oil NOT rub to switch from a shine to matte look.

2542 2018-06-13 19:07:40 Bit of an oil tanker really. Stuck with low budgets for some tinkering with calming when we should be redesigning. I tend to say to councillors that we can stop traffic calming when they let us redesign layouts. Some are starting to get it.
2543 2018-06-13 19:07:40 Could you clarify what section of the CWA the complaint challenges?
I understand stormwater discharges to be exempt for pipelines but it sounds like this is related to construction - a different section? No exemption for oil & gas?
2544 2018-06-13 19:07:33 Dems think we are IDIOTS! They try to make political hay out of a  rule to eliminate donations from Oil & Gas Companies? HILARIOUS!

2546 2018-06-13 19:07:09 Denmark has substantial oil and natural gas fields relative to its size in the North Sea. Ireland has a substantial financial services sector.

Rich Norway built most of its navy overseas. All it's frigates were built in Spain. It's submarines were built in Germany.

2563 2018-06-13 19:05:26 Don't know if this is still true, but I remember reading that the ROI of something like Deepwater Horizon was over a decade. I don't think there's anyway for renewables to take over without oil companies collapsing and it'll take more than market forces to pull that off
2564 2018-06-13 19:05:25 Yes Mr. President, The Oil prices has being inching up day by day, and I have ask myself Why? Since our country is producing more Oil than any previous Administrations under your leadership! So OPEC is playing dirty against us.
2565 2018-06-13 19:05:19 We pray that we will escape the oil curse. This is one way to spake off that curse. While at it oil is being siphoned
2566 2018-06-13 19:04:52 I wish it were otherwise, but all the objective data points to EVs (and green cars more broadly) being a high-end niche. At least for the next two product cycles or so (3-10 years), barring a black swan in oil markets (or emission regulation).

2574 2018-06-13 19:04:34 Mind you this is the GOP preferred result because the more voters the more liberal the election results.  @POTUS actually stated his philosophy "ever heard of to the victor go the spoils" regarding wars and claiming oil in the middle east.  A war crime violation.

2596 2018-06-13 19:02:47 His tweet is true, my response is predictive. Canada is a big supplier of crude to the US, Russia depends on oil. People have said he, Ross, and others in their tribe have a 19.5% stake in Russian oil company Rosneft. As he likes to say, we'll see what happens.
2597 2018-06-13 19:02:38 The only thing that could rationally explain @POTUS @realDonaldTrump ‘deal’ with North Korean leader #KimJongUn would be the undisclosed discovery of massive oil reserves in the Sea of Japan and / or the Yellow Sea.

I strongly suggest nasal steroid spray if it’s bad & lots of eucalyptus oil steam (in bath, in a bowl to breathe in, even on your neck/chest). Stay VERY hydrated as you’re losing fluids in your mucus membranes. Good luck! All best
2609 2018-06-13 19:01:05 For #brain #health, eat Foods rich in Omega-3 fatty acids from deep-water fish such as salmon & other oily fish like sardines & herring; avocados, nuts & seeds (walnuts & chia seeds have the most), flax seed oil.

2610 2018-06-13 19:01:03  Trump/Putin's goal IS to manipulate oil markets to increase barrel prices for Russia. This OPEC Act will never be passed by Trump/the GOP and you KNOW it. We're not stupid, Senator. Do something about the big bank/pharma bribes you Democrats take and then get back to us.
2611 2018-06-13 19:00:58 Oil gas taxes everything is high and messed up right now what happened to our beautiful AMERICA? Trump...sad

2615 2018-06-13 19:00:36 Swimmer’s Ear: COCONUT OIL. Using a dropper, put a few melted drops into affected (warm, not hot). Place cotton ball in ear so oil doesn’t leak out. Leave for 15-20mins and then lay with head down so oil drains. #alternativeHealth #SwimmersEar #CoconutOil #remedies #4gardenSeed

2619 2018-06-13 19:00:01 Coconut, date, sago, and oil palms are less productive, but still far more so than maples and birches.

Where is the mailman lol how pretty is this and it smells amazing and non sticky 
2623 2018-06-13 18:59:54 Question for you - even you can concede that fossil fuels are dirty.  (Forget the global impacts for a second). Why wouldn’t you be in favor of using renewable energy?  Cleaner for the workers and no mess like coal / oil.  Where’s the damage by moving away from fossil fuels?
2624 2018-06-13 18:59:41 Both China and Trumps Allie Putin have been giving N Korea oil for yrs and still do.The far tip of Russia has tankers full secretly shipping

If there isn’t enough evidence/research to allow you to support it isn’t that why people like me donate to your charity?

2635 2018-06-13 18:58:36 The oil giants want the carbon tax applied to the taxpayer which allows the oil company to extract oil and ship it out of the country without a tax.
2636 2018-06-13 18:58:32 And one observation to make - this should clear up any question as to whether oil production by PDVSA is totally crashing.
2637 2018-06-13 18:58:29 @potus - Mexico will pay for and build a wall to keep OPEC oil out. Seriously - if the price is too high - don't buy the oil. Isn't that the Free Trade works?
2638 2018-06-13 18:58:29 You also just pissed off your #1 oil supplier who is now building a pipeline to ship the oil to somewhere other than the USA - nice work .

2641 2018-06-13 18:58:09 Drilling for oil doesn’t cause oil spills. The unsafe transportation of it, from other countries causes spills.
We produce lots of oil internally(US and Canada) that doesn’t spill :)
But, I do get your point
2642 2018-06-13 18:58:02 So North Korea's two largest trading partners area Russia and China.    Just how did Germany, Italy, and Japan align? Something about oil right?  Just how many of these Trump people sleep through history class? Like 99% ?
2643 2018-06-13 18:57:57 Actually No.
Big Oil and the US Military have been winning. ETH gets ~$90B while Big Oil gets >$1T (factoring in the US Defense budget to keep shipping routes open).

2653 2018-06-13 18:57:03 Funny how Powell says he expects inflation to run above 2% this summer based on higher oil prices...but that he knows it oil will come back down. What if it stays the same or even increases?
2654 2018-06-13 18:56:59 its all about what you use to put it up. Use a long stretchy headband instead of a hair tie! it creates an illusion of a pineapple. Also if you want your hair to grow a bigger pineapple, do a lot of protective hairstyles and put oil on your scalp and wrap your hair every night.
2655 2018-06-13 18:56:50 This is my reality.. I was raised in a Baptist church.. My beliefs are mine.. I haven't belonged to a church since I was a kid.. I've got MAJOR ISSUES with organized religion.. Almost every war fought in history has been for religion or oil..

2673 2018-06-13 18:55:08 Powell: "The FED expects inflation to trend above 2% in the summer months based on higher oil prices." Yea...and what is your point? You act like oil is going up, but coming right back down. What if prices stay elevated - what if they go even higher? $GLD $GDX $XLE $UUP

2686 2018-06-13 18:54:09 I think you may need to look into what goes into pricing a barrel of oil a bit more deeply. Specifically current proven reserves (lots), OPEC’s role (significant), and the likelihood of “taxing” oil production in all oil-producing countries (nil).

2690 2018-06-13 18:53:57 Why, as a UK company, are you so reliant on palm oil in your products though. Why not use UK rapeseed oil instead? That would be a win-win for UK farmers and the rainforest alike. Follow @IcelandFoods lead - ditch palm oil.
2691 2018-06-13 18:53:52 Dont think anyone is quite sure where he parked the car but you are correct on location of oil tank.   When he arrived at the site he reversed his car i to the driveway so im gonna guess it was about half way up.  Making it still visible to the police.

2707 2018-06-13 18:53:09 If they did what message would markets take? That without release of emergency reserves that oil prices would spike upwards?

2725 2018-06-13 18:51:32 Yep poverty is big business, look at the trussel trust that run food banks, they make a fair bit of money even have shares in oil companies like she'll and BP. I can't help think the tories have manufactured the crisis to make their friends more money through the suffering

2729 2018-06-13 18:51:19 As well as a smaller population they more likely have more legal right over the oil fields nearby. Low pop and a high-income nation is a good bet for prosperity.

Of course. Westminister arent going to argue that point... Are they.
2730 2018-06-13 18:51:05 Powell, in response to question from @donnaborak of @CNNMoney about inflation, says Fed knows that inflation will bounce around. Headline inflation may go up due to oil for example.
2731 2018-06-13 18:50:55 From MarketWatch:
"Oil prices turned higher on Wednesday after a U.S. government report revealed a bigger-than-expected decline in domestic crude supplies, which was the largest one-week drop since the end of March."
Is this OPEC's fault?
2732 2018-06-13 18:50:53 The last time I drove a car regularly was 2012-2014, when oil was roughly $90/barrel. The dollars in my wallet felt "transitory" then!

2738 2018-06-13 18:50:15 You are just realizing that oil prices are too high Mr Trump? Where have you been for the past year? Is it really all OPEC's fault, or are they just another convenient excuse for you? 

Mr Trump, you have no credibility!

2740 2018-06-13 18:50:10 @seanhannity Dems are pushing Joe Manchin out in WV DNC announced the Democrats cannot take money from Coal Oil or Gas.Nancy wants it fixed where 200.00 is the limit from anyone who works in this industry
2741 2018-06-13 18:49:31 はちみつたっぷりパンケーキと甘いカフェオレが食いたい
2742 2018-06-13 18:49:24 That snake oil still sells and doctors are vulnerable to it as well
2743 2018-06-13 18:49:14 @rushlimbaugh Mexican candidates for Pres. all running on climate change issues. Will look to add solar panels on every home. Planning to add wind farms around the country. To go all in on electric vehicles. Shutdown nuclear and oil refineries. But they never say how to pay.
2744 2018-06-13 18:49:13 オイルだからってオイルツイートばかりな訳じゃないぞ。油ツイートもするよ。
2745 2018-06-13 18:48:59 AMBASSADOR THANKS TO JESUS I FEEL MUCH BETTER MY SLEEP IS GOOD; I FEEL REFRESHED IN THE MORNING ;I DO EAT SOMETHING EACH DAY I MUST BE CAUTIOUS !TODAY I WILL HAVE BOILED STUFFED PEPPERS WITH OIL GARLIC AND BREAD CRUMBS THEN BAKED!
2746 2018-06-13 18:48:47 Oil change
State Inspection
Renew Registration
Stop turning on my windshield wipers every time I pass a cop so he can’t see my expired sticker
2747 2018-06-13 18:48:41 Coconut oil or avocado oil
2748 2018-06-13 18:48:40 hey if mosch is trying to get a new vibrator or some body oil idk why we can’t help a brother out ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2749 2018-06-13 18:48:39 I could’ve gotten you a $20 oil change and tire rotation. Stracks hands out those coupons 24/7 and customers always throw them away I have like 6 
2750 2018-06-13 18:48:36 @JimWatsonOttawa we should have a plastic to oil operation for the Ottawa area. Make the fuel. for our garbage trucks and other city equipment. It's like having an oil well/refinery in back yard.
2751 2018-06-13 18:48:32 We are producing most of our nations needs but OPEC is still limiting production it’s due to global oil supply. Trump just asked OPEC to produce more
2752 2018-06-13 18:48:22 DNC announced the Democrats cannot take money from Coal Oil or Gas.Nancy wants it fixed where 200.00 is the limit from anyone who works in this industry They sink lower
2753 2018-06-13 18:48:19 Water and oil
2754 2018-06-13 18:48:15 自分と太郎もミタリカいるって騒いでたお
2755 2018-06-13 18:48:06 The Future is waste based energy production. No Cap for Used Cooking Oil to Biodiesel. UCO is no food waste but has to be disposed and processed to Energy. A Cap would endanger collection systems and will have double negativ impact. #EnergyfromWaste
2756 2018-06-13 18:48:02 Prayer circle that it’s not raining when I get out of my drs appt. I’m pretty sure I need to put oil in my truck before I can go home. I didn’t want to mess with it before my appt. I’m anxious enough without having to deal with my truck. 
2757 2018-06-13 18:47:59 What do they call that thing in a car that you use to measure the oil level?
2758 2018-06-13 18:47:59 DRILL BABY, DRILL! We need more oil from the US 
2759 2018-06-13 18:47:54 It is quite famous for oil and salmon ^^
2760 2018-06-13 18:47:49 So I’ve been putting a light amount of tea tree oil on the ends of my hair after my showers and when I wake up. I was skeptical b/c my hair is naturally oily but my hair feels and looks AMAZING. 
2761 2018-06-13 18:47:38 BTW, the REAL cause of higher oil prices? Putin conspiring with Saudi Arabia and other OPEC countries to eliminate an oil surplus and drive the price up so that they can profit. So criticize Putin why don't you? Go ahead - I DARE you. Say ONE bad word about Putin. Just ONE. 2/2
2762 2018-06-13 18:47:29 Obvious. You underestimate @realDonaldTrump Conservatives have to make compromise plan on Nafta, present to us, and push for it.,you must phase out supply mgt, do bilateral deal, and  real kicker, ask Trump to pay more for our oil (to subsidize dairy).. remember this suggestion.
2763 2018-06-13 18:47:09 [Trust me..essential oil works]
2764 2018-06-13 18:47:01 Yeah, although biofuels won’t be carbon neutral until we add CCS to the ethanol biorefineries, and make sure we’re only counting as carbon neutral the extra ethanol produced beyond the oil consumed in producing it.
2765 2018-06-13 18:47:00 Or 'git some'.
2766 2018-06-13 18:46:58 Herman Cain handled the FACT that separate you from A to B. African oil nations to everybody for your wonderful statement.
2767 2018-06-13 18:46:57 EU attitude to data is it’s the new infrastructure not the new oil - @AureliePols. #FederationPresents #GDPR
2768 2018-06-13 18:46:55 Grab some Melaleuca Oil and rub it all over you. Bugs hate it!
2769 2018-06-13 18:46:51 How I wish I can swim in efficascent oil rn
2770 2018-06-13 18:46:49 Your oil friends?  It's all about the OiL..not the kids and moms you are separating at the borders.  Smell the taking? Lol
2771 2018-06-13 18:46:48 Have you dug into the employment stats yet and found out that the oil and gas sector has not got the best record of job creation, especially longterm?
2772 2018-06-13 18:46:44 I refuse to buy products containing palm oil. Lurpak butter actively states NO PALM OIL but all other spreads seem to contain it.  Bread is difficult to find without palm oil as an ingredient. Tesco's bread is a major culprit for this hideous destroyer of the rain forests.
2773 2018-06-13 18:46:43 Chef Ramses cut up some acne, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was some live hornets, along with Silly Putty.
2774 2018-06-13 18:46:30 DNC announced the Democrats cannot take money from Coal Oil or Gas.Nancy wants it fixed where 200.00 is the limit from anyone who works in this industry They have sank lower
2775 2018-06-13 18:46:19 This is our chance. The future of the Arctic Refuge is about to be decided. Join me and @TheWCS to say "Absolutely no drilling for oil and gas in the Arctic Refuge" http://1/#.WyFmeFlm0rA.twitter
2776 2018-06-13 18:46:16 Is mining cobalt any worse than drilling for oil? How many oil spills have there been since we started using it?
2777 2018-06-13 18:45:45 I can use castor oil consistently for two weeks straight and not see results until a month later 
2778 2018-06-13 18:45:32 And in all your joy Scotland could sneak away and be an independent country and no one would notice, until England had to pay the bills, and the lights went out, and you had no water, or oil, or fish etc
2779 2018-06-13 18:45:24 Agreed. It’s the only essential oil sort of scent that I just hate.
2780 2018-06-13 18:45:23 My manager just tried to blame me for the oil in the machine not being changed in over a year.......I've been working here for 7 months.  #INeedARealJob!!
2781 2018-06-13 18:45:21 I ground up some lavender and that burns really well it doesn't even need makko added, but weirdly it doesn't have much scent with burning. I'm gonna make cones and use lavender essential oil to mix it to try and get more of a lavender smell
2782 2018-06-13 18:45:14 President Barack Obama would of been on this 3 months ago, your Late, the oil money sent your way must of been really nice figures for you to Ignore it so long! Hell it's too late they made Billions off us already, how much was your take?
2783 2018-06-13 18:45:13 There is a particular oil you carry, the Oil,  that is for your breakthrough.

#Prayer O Lord my God, preserve and multiply the oil for my breakthrough. 

#KingOmudu #Exponential #FromMinimumtoMaximum #YearofTheOverflow #UnderHisShelter
2784 2018-06-13 18:45:08 You sound butt hurt bro, Some olive oil would help 
2785 2018-06-13 18:44:55 We pay the highest gas prices in TX because they know the oil companies and oil service companies, trucking companies  have to have lots of fuel so we get gouged.
2786 2018-06-13 18:44:50 Yup! And it cost me a small fortune because of course my car takes synthetic oil or some shit
2787 2018-06-13 18:44:41 Brosseau: Why doesn't the PM understand that he should invest in green tech not oil pipelines? PM: We are investing in the pipeline so we can access other markets aside from the U.S.  #hw
2788 2018-06-13 18:44:11 screw palm oil and the selfish humans who are out here destroying the planet  for money
2789 2018-06-13 18:44:07 Nah, if he had donors help his wife he is at risk of being compromised by big oil, and other donors. Liberals will attach to it as a talking point. Replace the guy, and problem is solved.
2790 2018-06-13 18:44:06 I know this is a flashlight as but I swore I thought it was for oil of olay.
2791 2018-06-13 18:44:06 What are people’s views, experiences, cautions with CBD oil?
2792 2018-06-13 18:44:04 What a family those Rockefellers are. Remember how JD4, stood to fight "Big Oil"? What a guy.
2793 2018-06-13 18:43:52 U.S. didn't "give" $150b. It was money that other countries owed Iran for purchasing Iran’s oil. Because of sanctions, money was frozen there. Money wasn't ours. Nobody “gave” Iran 150 billion, they let Iran access her own assets abroad.

Facts don't care if you believe them.
2794 2018-06-13 18:43:47 Just saw my old dealer, Shrader Tire + Oil in Cincinnati for the first time in my life. 

Hey Nick, John @Shrader1948 say you come to Cincinnati, check-in.

Moving in aye?

#Tricounty #Cincinnati #Tires
2795 2018-06-13 18:43:37 Could just be dripping from you under body protector.  Sometimes it will have oil build up.  But that oil looks brand new based on the clarity of it.  its not old oil.
2796 2018-06-13 18:43:35 I second that, and I will fill his gas tank and give him some oil money.
2797 2018-06-13 18:43:32 Kwan: Why is the gov't bailing out Kinder Morgan when they are not filing proper environmental reports? PM: The Tories failed to  build infrastructure to get Canadian oil to international markets for a decade, the NDP want to keep resources locked in the US market #hw
2798 2018-06-13 18:43:28 I haven’t watched a game in years. And every time I check a score, etc it drives me nuts. Been “rebuilding” for 15 years. Sandy is a snake oil salesman, Wilson’s worst owners in sports and Callaway is a joke too
2799 2018-06-13 18:43:26 No, but they have oil.
2800 2018-06-13 18:43:22 It is as difficult as prospecting for oil without ground penetrating radar but we know oil exists.
2801 2018-06-13 18:43:17 Lorna Cline @rlcline10 
Please withdraw this amendment!!  Hemp oil is used by many people with very good results. I use Hemp oil and need it for chronic pain.
2802 2018-06-13 18:43:15 This new oil I got makes me have some weird ass dreams lmao
2803 2018-06-13 18:43:00 Using the pound. All the oil we had and how much it was worth.
2804 2018-06-13 18:42:57 Yes that’s fine, I’m not sure if I’ll do a set, but you can diff have the gel without the oil, you know for wash & gos twist outs etc.
2805 2018-06-13 18:42:57 Even the gods might turn this down
Rice, pawpaw, banana, biscuit, Egg and scattered fish.
Buttttttt.......
No Coke
No red oil
No native chicken tied with red and white thread.
Rejected immediately.
2806 2018-06-13 18:42:54 it does have good ingredients : hyaluronic acid, rosehip oil, sweet almond oil, aloe, argan oil, grape leaf and camomile. I'll let you know when is available in stock, I'm literally stalking their website lol
2807 2018-06-13 18:42:53 It was fuel oil
2808 2018-06-13 18:42:46 Who know how to change a oil on a car ?
2809 2018-06-13 18:42:44 Watch out guys, it’s the essential oil people convention in downtown slc. The whole area smells like lavender and patchouli because of all the Mormon meth mommy anti vaxxers
2810 2018-06-13 18:42:39 I would know a few people that would take it down but it would  be north sea oil prices
2811 2018-06-13 18:42:38 enakkkk, ada sensasi dinginnya & bikin muka fresh gituu tapii kalau buat jerawat engga terlalu ngaruh juga sih... ini cuman bener-bener buat ngebersihin aja tapii tapii kalau kamu pakenya di campur sama tea tree oil, ini lumayan work walau agak lama :)))
2812 2018-06-13 18:42:36 Wrong.  Trump fixed the economy. Obama’s policies along with Clinton’s TPA devastated manufacturing in America, displacing tens of thousands of workers.   BO’s regulations on oil & gas cost 3 of my family members their jobs in 2016.  Trump puts America &   #AmericanWorkersFirst .
2813 2018-06-13 18:42:34 You can shine leather shoes with a cloth and some vegetable oil.
2814 2018-06-13 18:42:32 Car getting an oil change, pre-gaming for #ThirstyThursday
2815 2018-06-13 18:42:26 Few Canaries records all classified as ship-assisted. Current nestbuilding bird on Fuerteventura arrived with 1/2 others on a mobile oil rig that was based off W Africa. Birds off Mauritania have turned up on boats/oil rigs too
2816 2018-06-13 18:42:17 12 grown men on a oil rig sitting glued to Coronation Street in the smoke room, testing young Stranraer boys patience
2817 2018-06-13 18:42:08 You might set a record yet, if oil goes over $141. That's the record set when the last unelected loser took down the economy.
2818 2018-06-13 18:42:06 Sighs, I spent so much money on oil paint and supplies for it but I’m horrible at it :((
2819 2018-06-13 18:41:59 Richie. Did u do it right maybe I will have you cone donw to my place and change the oil 
2820 2018-06-13 18:41:55 im looking for uk thc oil vendors .. thanks in advance ..
2821 2018-06-13 18:41:55 #88e Nervous people sell on an EXPECTED RNS.Did you think oil was going to "fountain" straight away? This is not the Dallas tv show!! 
What price are you waiting for to sell up? 3p you mentioned in a tweet..lets hope that is very soon.Then we dont get your pointless comments!!
2822 2018-06-13 18:41:42 Really wish @tykables diapers didn't smell like oil. Love them, but the smell makes my SO sick.
2823 2018-06-13 18:41:39 Avocado, lemon, olive oil (or other tasty oil), salt & pepper make the best salad dressing!!
2824 2018-06-13 18:41:32 Thanks to @realdonaldtrump rejecting the Keystone XL pipeline, China has become Canada's biggest oil consumer. China is laughing at us!
2825 2018-06-13 18:41:26 By the way, our biggest oil import friend is CANADA. You know, our new "weak" enemy.
2826 2018-06-13 18:41:22 More mosque ,yes of course as long as you put 5%!of your oil company on the London stock exchange you can build as many as you like?
2827 2018-06-13 18:41:22 We’re so excited to launch our newest, coolest product in collaboration with our fabulous residents artist @celitalerum Timeless Figge Oil Portraits on beautiful box-framed wood panels... #timeless  @ Figge Photography, Inc.
2828 2018-06-13 18:41:15 I prefer Haleigh’s Hope (order online & is legal in every state) Charlotte’s Web is apparently really good too. All are medical grade & were initially formulated to help children. DONT buy oil made from hemp - it is NOT the same. The stuff in smoke shops is not meant 4 seizures.
2829 2018-06-13 18:41:03 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.
2830 2018-06-13 18:41:03 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
2831 2018-06-13 18:40:47 Endless END OF THE PETRO DOLLAR blather- no reevaluation considering the US is now the Number one oil producer AHEAD of Saudi Arabia. Mindless repeating of "end of dollar hegemony", "gold set to launch" and the audience that eats it up and repeats it religiously
2832 2018-06-13 18:40:40 @realDonaldTrump get the US oil companies to cut prices in USA and raise export prices to the max. Go Greatest President you are what we have needed. Jim Thomas is my Attorney.
2833 2018-06-13 18:40:37 Send troops to Venezuela and we’ll split our oil with you
2834 2018-06-13 18:40:27 Execssive and unnecessary wellness content marketing is becoming the internet equivalent of oil spills
2835 2018-06-13 18:40:26 $CEI Long .3180 Avg off $SPI runner went over 75% both oil names similar charts could be an overnight.
2836 2018-06-13 18:40:21 IF you are interested, Ray Kurzweil has been attempting to do in real life what the show is doing this season. It makes this season more Black Mirror like. You can find out about his research in "Transcendent Man" :-)

2839 2018-06-13 18:40:07 I changed the oil in my friends car. Hopefully I did it right I never changed oil before nore do I have a car 
2840 2018-06-13 18:40:06 Oil change is done in my car, next up is getting the damn ac working again before i melt this summer
2841 2018-06-13 18:40:03 #POWELL: #Inflation data is encouraging but we don't want to declare victory. #Oil prices will push inflation higher in coming months but will only have a transitory impact on long-term expectations | LIVE #FED|
2842 2018-06-13 18:40:01 Sir, Pakistan is on the verge of sovereign default, it will soon have to choose between paying loan or paying for oil, Wth FATA movement & Karachi on the boil,caretaker govt in place,civil breakdown cannot be ruled out, I think IMF & China shd let the deep state do a"Full Monty"
2843 2018-06-13 18:40:01 Powell: ‘Too Soon’ To Declare Victory On Inflation, Thought Recent Data Has Been ‘Encouraging’.
Recent Rise In Oil Prices Seen Pushing Inflation Above 2%, Effect On Oil Expected To Be Transitory.
Rates Expected To Move Closer To Neutral Level Over The Next Year Or So.
2844 2018-06-13 18:39:58 Your tweet isn't going to drive down oil price, if that's how you feel, wake up.

2849 2018-06-13 18:39:46 Was gonna go the gym today but I’m already sitting in a sauna waiting for valvoline to do my oil....if you guys don’t know/ don’t have the right tools just tell me and I’ll go somewhere else.
2850 2018-06-13 18:39:46 Are there any situations in which a more specific word would be appropriate (i.e. spliff, marijuana cigarette, hash oil etc.) or should it always just be marijuana/marijuana product?
2851 2018-06-13 18:39:45 That's what oil money will do for you !
2852 2018-06-13 18:39:33 For anyone asking about CBD - I give my epileptic dog prescribed medicine from the vet (phenobarbital & potassium bromide) and supplement CBD oil at night. Every dog is different and it may or may not actually help. I give it at night time only bc that’s when his seizures happen.
2853 2018-06-13 18:39:20 Canola oil is the 1st ingredient 
2854 2018-06-13 18:39:13 Not best economy ever..  stock market may be high but cost of living is at its highest, medical premiums at their highest and climbing, rent at its highest, oil higher than the last 5 years... the poor are getting killed.. but that doesn't matter to Trump
2855 2018-06-13 18:39:12 Still need pipelines - West to ship to Asia or East to ship to replace human rights ‘dirty’ Saudi oil. Refineries are a money loser so not sure I want Cdn gov’t to own both pipelines & refineries. One is bad enough. Also, we can’t build a pipeline east because no one wants it.
2856 2018-06-13 18:39:08 What is your plan to make Alberta oil a profitable option given that, in the current market, the cost per barre to extract oil from the oil sands costs more than the price of a barrel of oil?
2857 2018-06-13 18:38:56 Funny oil prices didn't go up until after Jared visited. When he got back gas went up $0.05 cents a week $0.10 for the holiday weekend then back to $0.05 per week. I think@realdonaldtrump knew about the price raises and is profiting from them.
2858 2018-06-13 18:38:53 So go under their price and everyone will buy your oil. What seems to be the problem here?
2859 2018-06-13 18:38:45 Watch the ENTIRE video. She tried it with the blender egg provided, with a brush, with oil, without oil. It failed. It came off, broke apart, oxidised. Every review I have seen shows the same. Stop blaming the consumer. Trying to make a foundation work shouldn’t be so hard!
2860 2018-06-13 18:38:38 But they'll continue to accept 7+ figure donations to their charities from the 2nd largest crude oil producing country.
2861 2018-06-13 18:38:32 Well the Global Gang and even their Corp DC Surrogates haven't quite "allowed" Trump to be in control of even the USA yet and he's SPANKING their global oil and gas manipulators and global money controllers. THEY are playing this game. They aren't real happy w Trump now. 
2862 2018-06-13 18:38:29 You promote what you tolerate!
2863 2018-06-13 18:38:26 ya kan cuman mau liat sgmna efek aturan ffp ke LK klub bola itu. Kalo blm ipo susah datanya.
2864 2018-06-13 18:38:21 If you lift sanctions on Iran & Venuzuela then the oil price will be lower. These are oil exporting countries wich would export more without these sanctions.
2865 2018-06-13 18:38:14 The decomposition point of Olive Oil is 220 degrees Celsius
2866 2018-06-13 18:38:13 my friend, as you know, manipulating prices set in free markets is the work of regulators. Do you intend to regulate oil prices?
2867 2018-06-13 18:38:12 ... and was obviously pro fracking, spent her life backing oil companies, didn't find a war for oil she didn't love etc. But yeah, those dumb Bernie folks...
2868 2018-06-13 18:38:07 Regarding inflation: inncrease in oil prices a "transitory development," -- Chairman Powell says.
2869 2018-06-13 18:38:02 Memo to Captain Marmalade:  one of the reasons oil prices are higher is because you pulled out of the Iran deal. But hey, it’s your coloring book. Color it any way you want.
2870 2018-06-13 18:37:58 For soup, cook ground garlic in oil, then simmer with chicken, curry powder, beef broth and mushrooms. Top with olive oil.
2871 2018-06-13 18:37:43 One more reason to replace oil.
2872 2018-06-13 18:37:37 Made this day so productive, got up and got dressed for my doc appointment, got the oil changed on my car. Now to go grocery shopping :)
2873 2018-06-13 18:37:36 Hmm, that sounds like lawyer weasel language using technicalities. I won't take money from oil corporations but I have no problem taking it from its executives.
2874 2018-06-13 18:37:27 POWELL: OIL PRICE EFFECT ON INFLATION TO BE TRANSITORY

and if prices dont fall?
2875 2018-06-13 18:37:27 You’ve obviously never tried fermented tofu in chilli oil? It’s fucking terrible 
2876 2018-06-13 18:37:24 Fed’s Powell: Recent Rise In Oil Prices Seen Pushing Inflation Above 2%, Effect On Oil Expected To Be Transitory
2877 2018-06-13 18:37:05 You talk so much bull shirt.... you guys are what destroyed this planet with your oil ,,, why couldn't you just build sand castles in the desert 
2878 2018-06-13 18:37:04 Oh my god, that’s an alert? It’s a miracle i haven’t seen it. My car is literally telling me now change my oil soon. Forrrrrrr about 3 weeks
2879 2018-06-13 18:37:02 The ghost of Janet Yellen. Powell just used the word "transitory" to describe the rise in oil prices and potential impact on inflation. Do a shot.
2880 2018-06-13 18:36:59 Plus palm oil. Palm oil is missing
2881 2018-06-13 18:36:52 like does anybody really read this kind of garbage...queer people? Who says something like this and wants to be taken seriously?
2882 2018-06-13 18:36:52 POWELL: RECENT RISE IN OIL PRICES WILL PUSH INFLATION ABOVE 2%, TO BE TRANSITORY. and if price doesnt fall? $CL_F $USO $ES_F $SPY
2883 2018-06-13 18:36:43 Funnily enough, UK had roughly the same amount of oil as Norway, but sold the exploitation rights and allowed (mostly US and Norwegian) firms to run the operations. And spent the oil receipts it did get rather than invest them properly.
2884 2018-06-13 18:36:34 I swear this month ain’t for me or my car: car note, insurance, inspection, oil change, tires!!!!!  smh
2885 2018-06-13 18:36:31 So I'm not a part of the Aggie cult. My wife is a 2%'er.

That being said, you want that ring. It is more valuable than your diploma, IMO.

For example, my wife literally just scored an interview with a big oil company. Aggie network was the catalyst.

Whoop! and shit.
2886 2018-06-13 18:36:31 oh poor you David Carr..you will have to ask Siri...
"hey Siri...has Stephen Sanderson got the oil out yet?"
"...............silence.............."

2887 2018-06-13 18:36:29 Oče je delal v firmi Standard vakuum oil company,to je dokaz,da so imeli dostop do motornih olj,iščem podatek kje imela ta ameriška firma sedež,glej zlomka Češka,Poljska.
2888 2018-06-13 18:36:26 Crack open the baby oil...
2889 2018-06-13 18:36:25 Fuel oil
2890 2018-06-13 18:36:16 Amen. Here in the TX panhandle all our water (basically) is groundwater. And we’re using the lion’s share to grow corn.
2891 2018-06-13 18:36:15 Smelling like metal/ industrial oil remains me of my dad when he would come home from work.
2892 2018-06-13 18:36:15 When I go to Whataburger I tend to see poor middle aged ppl working there.
2893 2018-06-13 18:36:13 i thought we were a energy exporter now.. why can't we just lower the price of oil? thought energy independent meant we had greater control on fluctuating pricing? What gives? And I support you Prez Trump! Help me out with this!!
2894 2018-06-13 18:36:12 Hope oil
2895 2018-06-13 18:36:11 MrKrabs_me_money.jpg
2896 2018-06-13 18:36:05 If you're home the recommended I've heard is to use olive oil. I have a botanical cleanser which is pretty much just olive oil and fragrance works great. For wipes I've used the Yes to cucumbers from target, they don't sting but not as effective as cleanser.
2897 2018-06-13 18:36:03 They seem to be more interested in protecting tax breaks for the oil&gas companies. 

Interesting as these companies also paid supervisors using these schemes....
2898 2018-06-13 18:35:49 Was this cbd oil or thc oil the kid had?
2899 2018-06-13 18:35:43 Beefsteak Tomato slice pretty thick
Layer- beefsteak Tomato, slices of BUFFALO mozzarella, basil infused olive oil, shrimp sliced lengthwise (you want them thin) or you can use thin sliced lobster, build a tower. That is it the complete recipe.
2900 2018-06-13 18:35:41 @SenatorLeahy @SenSanders 
As an auntie of an amazing teen with epilepsy, I am very concerned about the effect that the Grassley Hemp Amendment could have on access to CBD oil. Please vote no. #CBD
2901 2018-06-13 18:35:38 Rankin: We should invest in clean energy solutions, not oil. You'll break the promise we made to the world in Paris.

Trudeau: I only made that promise because I wanted the tv cameras to like me. No-one expected me to keep it.

#cdnpoli #qp
2902 2018-06-13 18:35:36 You dumb shit. Under Putin's orders you pulled out of the Iran Nuclear deal. This opened the door for Iran and Russia to cut oil production, tightening supply and raising prices.
Not OPEC.
2903 2018-06-13 18:35:32 I agree with this statement... but you also thought that the oil refinery station in New Braunfels was Sea World...
2904 2018-06-13 18:35:30 Norway is the richest country in the world because of their offshore oil reserves. We don't have that luxury.
2905 2018-06-13 18:35:30 My the way Mr. President we do not need to drill for oil or natural gas in the Arctic. Just explore renewable energy
2906 2018-06-13 18:35:29 آمين يارب
2907 2018-06-13 18:35:26 She was mouthy.
2908 2018-06-13 18:35:21 Wow Olli, you have such as shiny coat; do you take Olli'v Oil 
2909 2018-06-13 18:35:10 Oil
2910 2018-06-13 18:35:10 I note it says de-nuke by 2020. Anyone find the date convenient/suspicious/someone planning(hoping) for re-election? Are Americans stupid enough to buy it(snake oil)?
2911 2018-06-13 18:35:02 Nazi tweets water is wet or earth is round. Retweeting is endorsement of Nazism? 
Nobody in U.S knows who this guy is anyway.
2912 2018-06-13 18:34:54 Lol excellent? I take the intelligence back, the goal of the EPA is to protect the environment he’s a pro gas/oil lobbyist lol, good day fly back to Krypton pls
2913 2018-06-13 18:34:49 Had a good run on some commodity trades and now parked the majority of that across my 3 big holds on aim #ARS #CASP #EVRH . All dipped recently but expect all to be back over 15p in the not too distant future . #BTFD #copper #oil #vr
2914 2018-06-13 18:34:42 I guess I just get really invested in characters. :-) To each his or her own! Plus, I'm SUPER interested in transhumanism and posthumanism ever since my master's thesis, so I have a whole other reason why I'm interested in the story.
2915 2018-06-13 18:34:39 use some peppermint oil my dude
2916 2018-06-13 18:34:39 Boulerice: Cambridge University says that the demand for oil will drop by 2050. Yet you're still spending $4.5 billion on a pipeline. What's next VHS?

Trudeau: You still believe there's a choice to be made. Wrong! I already made the choice for everyone.

#cdnpoli #qp
2917 2018-06-13 18:34:36 Does anyone remember how trump was on about taking someone's oil at a speech he did I think at the CIA?. I see he has tweeted about oil recently. He wants nothing to do with the Iran deal. Convinient if he invaded Iran oh and then had access to their oil. You never know. #RESIST
2918 2018-06-13 18:34:31 Was this cbd oil that the kid had or was it thc oil?
2919 2018-06-13 18:34:29 @realDonaldTrump OIL GOES TO $120 A BARREL, INTEREST RATS GO UP UP UP, TRAD WAR IS BAD BAD BAD, YOU ARE TOAST NO JOKE NO FAKE NEWS
2920 2018-06-13 18:34:20 And add small red oil on it
2921 2018-06-13 18:34:17 If one side being made a fool of by another for another, may need to realize the complexities at work. May not be worth fighting for the overseas oil companies, in the final analysis?
2922 2018-06-13 18:34:14 cbd oil is the new crypto: 

-i will never buy any
-i will take some for free
-i absolutely never want to hear you talk about it
2923 2018-06-13 18:34:09 I like tea tree oil for breakouts, I’ve never tried grapeseed oil. Is is good just for everyday use? I just need a good after the shower moisturizer.
2924 2018-06-13 18:34:08 334
2925 2018-06-13 18:33:58 @ITsENNYbaby Hi! Our Hair Growth Oil is only $16.99 at Target. If it was any higher than that please let us know. :) Thank you.
2926 2018-06-13 18:33:54 I would like to remind the scots the last time they did a major business deal with a oil/energy spanish company what happened ...
2927 2018-06-13 18:33:53 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
2928 2018-06-13 18:33:49 Half a peach brushed w/ olive oil, grill cut side down first, flip and top w/ ricotta and prosciutto. They are GREAT!
2929 2018-06-13 18:33:43 Lavender oil is excellent for relaxation and to aid in getting to sleep.
2930 2018-06-13 18:33:39 Well, how dare a company, owned by Christians, be allowed to succeed anyway, amirite?
2931 2018-06-13 18:33:37 Oil prices are too high and it trumps fault along with his rich friends
2932 2018-06-13 18:33:31 Getting a oil change & some extra shit
2933 2018-06-13 18:33:23 I think the only thing propping them up are 401ks and existing contracts that should be dead in the oil slicked water. Solar is killing them like the sun traditionally kills vampires, but goddam it's slow for this always unnecessary commodity.
2934 2018-06-13 18:33:19 Lol, OF COURSE Mike's taking money from the snake oil lobbyist group. Too bad his version of the farm bill and SNAP reform is tanking because of his total incompetence and complete inability to accomplish anything when he tries to take the lead on it.
2935 2018-06-13 18:33:15 This was suggested to oil and gas team in UK but the researchers didn't find it very environmental friendly for long term. I feel, we need more simulators to analyze it properly for years to come.
2936 2018-06-13 18:33:12 LMAOOOOO @sherylunderwood with Olive Oil having Pluto and Popeye fighting over her...  @TheTalkCBS #EverybodyTalks

2938 2018-06-13 18:33:07 I fucking HAAAATE taking my car into the dealership I regret buying it from Thomas Dodge SO MUCH bc the service sucks and so does my car half the time. Y is getting an oil change so fcking hard?¿
2939 2018-06-13 18:33:03 One part vegetable glycerin to three parts face oil, like coconut oil or argan oil. It might be a wee bit sticky and bees will love your face, but it works for me.
2940 2018-06-13 18:33:00 That's how someone collected oil well, nsogbu di
2941 2018-06-13 18:32:49 Need to oil Mother soon. Get all the hard-to-reach places.
2942 2018-06-13 18:32:37 You did this. Ripping up Iran deal you gave Russia higher oil prices
2943 2018-06-13 18:32:30 U.S. crude #oil futures settle at $66.64/bbl. $0.28. +0.42%. #CME #NYMEX $CL_N8 #OOTT

2944 2018-06-13 18:32:29 The rather damning 1988 report from Shell petroleum is publicly available and lends all the corroboration the scientists could ask for.

Hard to deny when even the oil companies acknowledge it! But still they do.
2945 2018-06-13 18:32:20 .@Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!
2946 2018-06-13 18:32:19 I’ll inject primrose oil into my veins
2947 2018-06-13 18:32:15 Mood: that vine where the kid runs into the kitchen and slips on oil and crashes into the oven

Or you are planning to go to war with Iran anyway.. just take their oil then
2950 2018-06-13 18:32:11 Does that include oil?
2951 2018-06-13 18:32:09 Speaking on environmental regulations at the Kentucky Oil and Gas Association in Louisville this afternoon.
2952 2018-06-13 18:32:02 @jakejakeny It is a good idea to jump on this. Oil needs to get back down to $60 a barrel. If inflation really begins to spike, we could see the Federal Reserve come down hard.  I do not want to see us slip into a recession next year.
2953 2018-06-13 18:32:00 OIL PRICES ARE HIGH BECAUSE YOU RIPPED UP THE IRAN DEAL DUMB ASS! NOW THE FEDERAL INTEREST RATES JUST GOT RAISED WHICH MEANS PEOPLE WILL PAY MORE FOR HOME LOANS
2954 2018-06-13 18:31:57 Oil prices are too high, @CarterRaimondi is at it again. Not good!
2955 2018-06-13 18:31:49 I'll put some other oil in ya eye
2956 2018-06-13 18:31:47 I got two free months of @SIRIUSXM with my oil change (thanks @Toyota). Listening to Lithium is reliving high school (insert old man jokes here). There's a reason I cosplay Old Man Keith 
2957 2018-06-13 18:31:37 There was a Oil spill on Santacruz-Chembur Link road, on route to Kurla - towards chembur Northbound. It has  has been cleared and our officers and staff are  on the spot  clearly the traffic.
2958 2018-06-13 18:31:24 I know, how are people surprised - all markets are manipulated, everything from Bitcoin to Oil.
2959 2018-06-13 18:31:20 @tiffydew just finished watching st.gallen. Yeah. Raining outisde, tears inside.
2960 2018-06-13 18:31:02 I don’t usually buy tuna from the same place that I buy motor oil! #TRLT #POstables
2961 2018-06-13 18:31:01 I thought we had an oil surplus?
2962 2018-06-13 18:30:51 That peanut oil is something else
2963 2018-06-13 18:30:45 Yes suadero is mostly flank steak, obviously it depends on who you ask, it's sometimes boiled and fried or just boiled, most of corner tacos do boiled and then throw it into the nasty/tasty oil for it to dry along with trips and longaniza and such
2964 2018-06-13 18:30:36 Yes, it's true that the so-called Green revolution increased food production, but it's based on enormous energy input (oil). To produce 1 food calory takes 10 calories of energy. If that stops, we face starvation.
2965 2018-06-13 18:30:30 Really? I've been enjoying this season, it's exploring different levels of posthumanism.  It's subtle, but interesting. I'm betting the episode you like was Kiksuya? It was fantastic! Even the MUSIC is subtle, how each character has a theme, and that theme changes with location
2966 2018-06-13 18:30:23 Thanks for following on Twitter! Probe supply high-tech tools and equipment to the Oil & Gas Industry. Like us on Facebook and see #SayProbe posts from around the world! June 13, 2018 at 01:30PM

2968 2018-06-13 18:30:11 $CL_F Oil to the rescue for now
2969 2018-06-13 18:30:09 Yes! Please do! Love mine with oil & vinegar, purple onions & carrots, just like my Memaw used to make! Always loved the #leftovers on a hot dog!

2972 2018-06-13 18:30:01 YOU caused the price increase w/UR Iran debacle! THAT'S Y U WANT TO IMPOSE A $.25 TAX HIKE-BECAUSE OIL $$S R TOO HIGH? Does UR base know this?

2975 2018-06-13 18:29:52 They look good. Put them in a bowl with some olive oil, sea salt and chopped fresh rosemary. Mix, wrap in foil and bake for about 40 mins. Yummy
2976 2018-06-13 18:29:41 Why don’t we play for natrual resources at the #WorldCup2018 Tomorrows game would be an oil vs oil game.
2977 2018-06-13 18:29:26 Is there any other type???

Beetroot bread with local mackerel fillets and spring onion and ginger oil on the fish with local asparagus
2981 2018-06-13 18:29:06 Wars will intensify drastically to artificially inflate oil prices in the following decades. The oil industry will take us all down with it.
2982 2018-06-13 18:29:05 Open US oil reserves and bring prices down!
2983 2018-06-13 18:29:03  oh, the irony of the oil industry needing to engineer solutions to challenges from climate change
2984 2018-06-13 18:28:58 That's what happens when a dumbass who, believes himself smarter than anyone else, places tariffs on one of the worlds largest oil producing Countries.
2985 2018-06-13 18:28:53 I need beard oil. Ran out days ago
2986 2018-06-13 18:28:11 i do that with my tea tree oil as well! do you put the grape seed oil on over or under it?
2987 2018-06-13 18:28:10 I would be willing to consider you a FULL 25% less worthless if you would crash oil prices and end our fracking nightmare forever.
2988 2018-06-13 18:27:51 Shrink acne by placing a wrapped ice cube on it and leave it on the pimple for 3 minutes. Then cover it with a dab of lavender oil.

2993 2018-06-13 18:26:48 A406 Angel Road (North Circular Road) at the junction of Montagu Road - The eastbound exit slip is now all clear following the clean up of an oil spill. Traffic is flowing well.
2994 2018-06-13 18:26:43 Yes!! I do the same thing! Tea tree also works really well if you have any random breakouts! I just dab a little on the effected area before I go to bed after I put on my grapeseed oil and my skin clears up overnight
2995 2018-06-13 18:26:42 Apparently Trump has no friends (or business interests) in the oil business, otherwise he’d be cheering for high prices.
2996 2018-06-13 18:26:31 if your country was an exporter oil, did you say this sentence again? dear president you must behave with justice in whole world.
2997 2018-06-13 18:26:30 I been in this car dealership since 12! Waiting on a oil change n tire rotation  I’m over it
2998 2018-06-13 18:26:28 Before, the government of PMB was crying foul on low price of Crude oil in the world market, 35dollar per barrel but now, the price has increased to 75dollar per barrel, we don't see any effect.
2999 2018-06-13 18:26:20 Fairly hard to credit having to say  this, but *do not* treat animal injuries with WD40 or cooking or motor oil. These substances do not 'kill germs by smothering them'. Take the animal to an actual vet, you absolute shitbrained pustule.
3000 2018-06-13 18:26:11 It’s probably oil knowing what a jammy bastard he is.
3001 2018-06-13 18:26:06 It is a very sad state. 

When the oil patch in Calgary was flying, employers were pissed b/c labour jumped to competitors for .10 cents more an hour.

They blamed labour not their own disloyalty and treatment of people
3002 2018-06-13 18:26:01 Xhosas and Honest is oil and water
3003 2018-06-13 18:25:52 To heal a pimple quickly, apply tea tree oil on pimple every few hours, and apply vitamin E oil on the spot, about 1 hour before bedtime.
3004 2018-06-13 18:25:51 What's happening with all the new  oil we've got in this country, why aren't we building a couple  new gas refineries ????  It's time !!!
3005 2018-06-13 18:25:36 Try jamaican dark castor oil i heard it works really well for hair growth
3006 2018-06-13 18:25:27 came to the dealership to get a oil change, ending up spending $800 
3007 2018-06-13 18:25:23 Potonya juga harus Ada kalo ga Ada dia ga bisa nyebrang

3009 2018-06-13 18:24:52 Please give Scotland Independence...let them raise their own taxes and live off the little oil left in the North Sea then they will see how they depend on the rest of the UK. Give em what they want! They are net takers into the economy, we will be well rid of em.
3010 2018-06-13 18:24:49 Taking your car to dealership for servicing, I just paid $160 for oil change

3012 2018-06-13 18:24:43 Stop de-valuing the US dollar and oil prices will go down!
3013 2018-06-13 18:24:36 I’m very impressed by you moving to no Palm Oil use. I’ve never been in your shops. I think I’ll take a look now! #IcelandFoods
3014 2018-06-13 18:24:31 and exactly when did oil prices start to race up???? within days of dear leader decision on the Iran deal. oil up. inflation takes off, all the fun new tariffs, economy crashes within 6 months....
3015 2018-06-13 18:24:30 nah me life has been changed forever after finding out that baby oil removes tan thing actually works
3016 2018-06-13 18:24:25 1-2 weeks for the turbo to come in. Need to chase down this oil leak. Gotta change my breaks/break fluid then bleed em, oil, spark plugs, and all drive train fluids. #questformorepower

3025 2018-06-13 18:23:00 The writing is on the wall for fossil fuels. Sustainable energies are here and the full switch merely needs to be subsidized half as much as we subsidize big oil. Fossil fuel stocks will collapse soon. Get out while you can.

Palm oil stew shouldn't exist

3030 2018-06-13 18:22:27 FUNNIEST THING EVER JUST HAPPENED. so i’m getting my oil changed and i just got to my appointment and gave him my keys and i go sit in the lounge and start listening to my ap lecture through my headphones. all of a sudden i can’t hear it anymore but it’s still playing
3031 2018-06-13 18:22:12 You will collect engine oil before car
3032 2018-06-13 18:22:01 So are you saying that we do not need an oil/gas industry? Are you saying that we should continually sell products to the US at a discount?
3033 2018-06-13 18:21:43 It attempted to jump from a bag and shoot someone. Quick thinking on his part prevented this. Clearly he saved the day.
3034 2018-06-13 18:21:42 What fighting over outdated and backward energy (oil) can do to your country. If Iran is backing those in Yemen who see oil as their priority to prosperity and civil society, looking at the wrong agenda.
3035 2018-06-13 18:21:36 you fry them once on low heat, then run 50 times around your house and then you fry them a second time on boiling oil, and then you run another 50 times around your house. Those calories don't burn emself.

3038 2018-06-13 18:20:59 خیلی جالب بود. درباره رابطه‌ی روسیه و اسراییل چنین ایده‌ای داشتم. اسراییل با پوتین بست که از امکانات سایبری روسیه به نفع انتخاب ترامپ استفاده کنه. و ترامپ هم اهداف صهیونیسم رو تامین کنه. ولی مهمترین هدف اسراییل، سرنگونی اسد و الحاق بلندی‌های جولان به خودش بود. نفت. Genie Oil.
3039 2018-06-13 18:20:57 First time using an oil mixed with my foundation, it’s so weird my skin feels wet and looks so glowy but when I touch it it’s completely matte! Amazing 
3040 2018-06-13 18:20:52 There is no evidence of that.  You're conflating the animosity with SK with a desire to invade.  The major rift in the peninsula is the nuclear weapons themselves.  You're also presuming a traditional imperialist model.  US went to middle east because of oil. NK is resource poor

3042 2018-06-13 18:20:48 sorry if im dumb but how does oil help that isn’t it now just a slimy tumbleweed
3043 2018-06-13 18:20:48 little radishes tossed with some oil blasted in a 500 oven and then removed from the oven and tossed with their leaves & butter is one of my favorite summer dishes. yes I said a 500 oven, no I do not have air conditioning in my kitchen
3044 2018-06-13 18:20:43 investing pensions in oil  bad bad idea.
3045 2018-06-13 18:20:39 the n-power,geep,whistle blower,anchors borrower,vaids,mining sector reforms,Lagos lbadan,calabar railway,the fertilizer programme,increase revenue from non oil sectors,new tax policies.etc lies that you people deliberately perpetuate.I pity the people that vote u as a senator.
3046 2018-06-13 18:20:36 Many expected it.  In fact, it was predicted that crude oil prices would rise when YOU pulled us out of the Iran nuclear deal.  Unfortunately, those who will be most affected are those who can least afford the higher prices.  Many of them are among your avid supporters.
3047 2018-06-13 18:20:30 Continuing my relistening of old eps - #TESD saves lives! 
#TESD48 - @ChickfilA uses peanut oil, both my brothers are allergic to peanuts  
Bummer, I should have already known that, but apparently I'm a terrible listener #2ndtimesthecharm 
3048 2018-06-13 18:20:29 This is what makes me worry about calls for near-term peaking of world oil demand - I’ve been disappointed so often by initially-promising trends. 
3049 2018-06-13 18:20:28 There is no better stew than palm oil stew,
If not for the stress of bleaching ,
I would eat it all day.
3050 2018-06-13 18:20:22 Cut off the cash? 

Are you seriously suggesting a small country of only 5 million people that has been spewing copious amounts of oil for over 50 years worth hundreds of billions has required to be subsidised? 

Think about that for a minute mate
3051 2018-06-13 18:20:19 Dum children need CBD oil....
3052 2018-06-13 18:20:18 Butch was right, no line no wait for an oil change at this time!! 
3053 2018-06-13 18:20:06 I suffer from a recurring trapped nerve kind of thing in my shoulder blade and it totally limits my movements from time to time. 

Today I tried some CBD oil for the first time to try ease it and WHAT IS THIS MAGIC?!
3054 2018-06-13 18:20:01 Sprouts are king in our house, quartered and roasted in the oven with some oil and spices.... give them a try, nowt like boiled sprouts, even I don't like them... maybe you could dehydrate them, wonder what they'd be like?
3055 2018-06-13 18:19:49 Venezuela circumstance is not entirely about socialism it’s more about oil and a deal with China and the current market rate of oil.

3064 2018-06-13 18:19:07 We need to tighten our belts and build a refinery so we don't need to sell oil to the States and buy it back at a higher price. It needs to be SAFE though. Not half-assed.

3083 2018-06-13 18:17:26 I've always had faith in our form of government. The checks and balance system of government was genius. The founding fathers didn't anticipate a con man, snake oil salesman.  When will this nightmare be over?

This is especially important if you are a do it yourself mechanic. These are easy to forget or put off.

3095 2018-06-13 18:16:31 To be though, when oil plunged from $60 to $25 in 2015, all of OPEC's horses and all of OPEC's men couldn't stop oil from plummeting again. Free market always wins in the long-term

3120 2018-06-13 18:14:08 I will never understand why it takes so damn long for a car dealer to do an oil change on a dang car 
3121 2018-06-13 18:13:51 True. We also have world's largest reserves per 1 report, another puts Russia and Saudi Arabia way above our reserves. The Saudi's increased production, lowers crude oil prices, shuts down drilling here.

I always have this one and our Roasted Garlic Infused Oil in my kitchen and use them almost daily.
3135 2018-06-13 18:12:47 Not necessary. I don't know much about the health advice given, who provided it and what their motivations were. I'm just quoting the original source stating that soy oil became more widely used due to its cheapness and availability, which was caused by high demand for meal

3141 2018-06-13 18:11:57 Open up the oil and gas reserves in Alaska quickly and also support and promote oilsands oil in Alberta. We have enough oil and gas in Canada and USA to overtake OPEC and sell world wide. Great job Mr. President!!!! I am a grateful conservative Christian Canadian. MAGA!
3142 2018-06-13 18:11:53 But you said:  “We are now, very proudly, an exporter of energy to the world.”                  Is it because you decided to cut off Iran’s exports, so their oil isn’t making it into the market?

3146 2018-06-13 18:11:37 We have looked forward...oil especially domestic oil production is much better for the environment than tens of thousands of acres of solar panels that use a massive amount of materials in their production. Is it windmills that kill birds by the millions?

3150 2018-06-13 18:11:22 Living in a small town is not telling your dad you’re going to get your oil changed and then seeing him pull up to get HIS oil changed too
3151 2018-06-13 18:11:17 I love old geezers who criticize young people for taking selfies because they forget that before cameras rich adults would commission very expensive real life size oil portraits of themselves to hang around the house forever
3152 2018-06-13 18:11:15 Well why are you still watching. Go learn how to oil paint. Spend more time to the family. No one should be watching the Mets right now.
3153 2018-06-13 18:11:09 It’s coconut oil in liquid state degrees in our apartment.
3154 2018-06-13 18:10:32 What ever happened to those fish oil lip glosses vele?
3155 2018-06-13 18:10:28 Doubt it, I suggest you get ready for when the world gets other sources of energy besides oil, cause that’s practically the only thing you produce and once the entire world dump oil for other alternative forms of energy you’ll be doomed.
3156 2018-06-13 18:10:27 What did you wash? Hopefully not chapstick or oil packets... Or a loose bottle of acid...
3157 2018-06-13 18:10:22 Oil prices are high because you made it so that Iran can’t sell theirs anymore, Dummy!
3158 2018-06-13 18:10:19 Blood for oil...Blood for Heroin
3159 2018-06-13 18:10:10 I am capitalism and my anatomy is the anatomy of a monster, I breathe fire, I consume oil, I tinker with your pretty brains.
3160 2018-06-13 18:10:07 え、君顎あるの？顎ってやっぱりどこかで買うの？僕顎持ってないんだけど。
3161 2018-06-13 18:10:06 Or any tea tree stuff from the body shop. I just like the oil for spot treatment.

3163 2018-06-13 18:09:35 From the smell of eucalyptus and lemon (or some combination thereof) I can correctly infer that there is an essential oil conference taking place this week.

3166 2018-06-13 18:09:20 @realDonaldTrump Please don’t export anymore oil . We need it in the US to bring gas prices down !
3167 2018-06-13 18:09:18 LOL...well listen...i never stopped using it...i use it everyday LOL but i put curing creame, leave-in and olive oil in first and then the ecostyler. LOL hopefully my shit won't fall out lol
3168 2018-06-13 18:09:17 Oil prices went up when you killed the Iran deal for no reason. Not good.
3169 2018-06-13 18:09:13 Iam worried that soon we shall be declared bankrupt.We need to save this country.we are even consuming poisonous sugar and cooking oil.
3170 2018-06-13 18:09:11 Oil, or other resources are the number one reason for wars and the USA is the world's aggressor!
3171 2018-06-13 18:09:10 Not sure if it's a cure, but pure vitamin e oil will Defo help it heal and probably help it stop itching  X
3172 2018-06-13 18:08:57 The richest country in the world producing just as much oil as the Middle East. Still has $4 a gallon, homelessness and a wack healthcare system.
3173 2018-06-13 18:08:55 haven’t had a breakout in over 6 months,shits lit & my skin care is just exfoliation & Rose hip oil
3174 2018-06-13 18:08:50 He's nothing but a sideshow, hack, snake oil salesman that isn't worth the time. #clickbaitwhore
3175 2018-06-13 18:08:43 And food security too in a world with ever more expensive oil & climate change, if our small scale fleet is allowed to die out, who’s going to catch the UK’s fish in 25 years? We’re an island nation. Letting the under 10s wither on the vine is madness.
3176 2018-06-13 18:08:36 There's one answer to the oil prices that would upset the oil company but help the people. Give the people back their natural resources. Make oil a national commodity and only sell excess production. It belongs to the people and not to Exxon.
3177 2018-06-13 18:08:34 Trump accuses OPEC of raising oil prices
3178 2018-06-13 18:08:33 Are you suggesting that the health advice to eat more veg oil was actually a drive to use up the by-product of meal?
3179 2018-06-13 18:08:30 doctors are all just snake oil salesmen

3184 2018-06-13 18:07:00 How easily you forget. Oil prices are up bc of your violations of Iran Deal. The Saudis are happy your actions resulted in larger profits for them.
3185 2018-06-13 18:06:58 “Grandpa needs CPR! Quick! Google it!”

Poor Grandpa never had a chance 
He either died or suffered from effects of oxygen depravation

3186 2018-06-13 18:06:53 Spilled hot coffee all over myself then an hour later someone spilled hot oil all over the same burns so I hope everyone has a blessed day 
3187 2018-06-13 18:06:40 Ok when you pull out of the Iran deal and oil prices rise that's bad.  Unless you are Russia who is dependent on higher oil prices.  They love you for that. Tariffs on Solar also increase demand.  The small tax refund will barely offset the increased cost of higher gas prices.
3188 2018-06-13 18:06:37 @narendramodi @dpradhanbjp today's crude oil rate is $70 per barrel. Hence after processing petrol should be round about 60₹ and diesel 50₹ including taxes.Though I am pro Modi this can be a reason where I would really think twice b4 electing @BJP4India in the #2019elections
3189 2018-06-13 18:06:32 Stick to that and expand the flock. No morelectures on climate change to the world and oil executives. We have enough of that already.
3190 2018-06-13 18:06:16 it was you with the actions you took on Iran that bumped the oil price
3191 2018-06-13 18:06:07 I thought Trump was annoyed with Trudeau for pushing the KinderMorgan pipeline to the west coast.  If the US doesn't need our gas and oil, Justin will ship it to China.
3192 2018-06-13 18:06:01 Now that you noticed oil prices are up. Maybe, you and fellow Democrats will reduce gas TAXES so the working class people can afford to drive to their vacation destination. 
WE know cutting TAXES goes against what incompetent politicians,they need the money to cover incompetence
3193 2018-06-13 18:06:00 Are you sure we use our own oil ? And not export it to us and Asia

Worst: Burger King. Mostly cause of mgmt and some poor experiences - like puberty + fry oil. Yea, pimples suck
3196 2018-06-13 18:05:15 ...it's actually not uncommon in cooking. Works especially good on fish and chicken. And it's almost as harmless to ingest as gold foil is.

Is this gonna cleanse/purify jack shit though? Oh hell no. If it was it'd look like used motor oil to have enough charcoal in it.
3197 2018-06-13 18:05:11 Not really breaking. Trump released the news early this morning when he complained about oil prices.

3203 2018-06-13 18:05:01 Yeah all I have is Aloe to help the itching but I'm thinking maybe coconut oil will help
3204 2018-06-13 18:05:01 Is he still hanging around? Jeez, intellectual Bell Curve theory is still used sporadically, but I was unaware this fraud is stilling peddling it! People looking for reasons to hate follow any snake oil salesmen who feeds their narrative. Bell Curve can be valid, not for IQ tho..

3206 2018-06-13 18:04:54 You can’t give El Norte all that oil. And we need a 150 mile Buffer zone running along the Mexican border on both sides.  We’ll call it, ‘cuz Mexico can’t, we will’

3217 2018-06-13 18:03:15 We have been telling you this for months. OPEC needs to see might of American oil production. Play fair or lose it all.
3218 2018-06-13 18:03:10 Overconfidence. Congress is ready to block ZTE deal while trump is ready to sanction chinese goods by end of the week or next  since talks have failed. This also means tough time for us on trade front while export growth is poor and deficit is rising with higher dollar and oil.
3219 2018-06-13 18:03:05 @dandakich Gas prices are climbing because 500M barrels of oil taken off world market because of Iran sanctions re-imposed.
3220 2018-06-13 18:03:00 I’m in Canadia and all the radio news is meh we will diversify our markets and sell our cheap oil somewhere else so

3228 2018-06-13 18:02:33 At #FundForum today I was asked why US, Canada, UK have all recently started bailing coal, oil and nuclear out when evidence of wasted capital is so clear.

3231 2018-06-13 18:02:19 My mom uses diluted tea tree oil, I always try to convince her to use natural products for my little sister for everything. Aloe Vera Gel and Witch Hazel are supposed to be good too.
3232 2018-06-13 18:02:18 Its never been more important to leave it in the ground 80% of fossil fuels must not be burned to meet climate change targets even the Pope said this to oil executives. Youre on the wrong side of history.
3233 2018-06-13 18:02:08 No the only one I’ve tried is the olive oil ecostyler one and the ORS olive oil edge control and they get the job done but then it starts to flake up after a few hours
3234 2018-06-13 18:01:56 I don’t know if it’ll be cheaper to use captured CO2 to make synthetic fuels, or to use it to for EOR of fossil oil. But either way we’ll need direct air capture (DAC) to fully decarbonize air transportation once we’ve finished decarbonizing power and industry.

3262 2018-06-13 17:58:41 I already know the answer before I ask, but does Trump realize that shale fracking is only economically viable at higher oil prices and that lowering them would cause an explosion of unemployment in Texas, Louisiana, Alaska, and North Dakota (like we saw a few years ago)?

3278 2018-06-13 17:56:47 Or not? Sometimes high oil is good for business, especially if your retail store is where Texas oil people go to shop. So I take that back don't call OPEC mr. president let oil prices go up.

Biggest cost element in road surfacing derived from oil/energy.
Crude ££ doubles & default reaction is to double all downstream prices. Price of crude later reduces by, say, £10, so downstream prices copy. This ensures a buffer against competition and supply/demand.

It’s also got something to do with water/blood/oil (liquids in general?) and the fourth dimension of time. Not sure how it will all fit together but I can’t wait to see!
3284 2018-06-13 17:56:24 I spilled vitamin e oil all in the bottom of my Neverfull. This is truly why i don’t deserve nice things
3285 2018-06-13 17:56:16 Thought we had so much oil we're shipping it to other countries? How bout lowering our price and raising theirs... WTF

3289 2018-06-13 17:55:57 Are you going to blame Obama for the oil price being to high, because you blame him for everything.

3293 2018-06-13 17:55:41 Why should Big Oil be allowed to internalize the profits while externalizing all the costs?

Taxpayers foot the bill for US military to protect your shipping lanes around the world. Super storms cause billions in damages, low lying cities are in danger.

Climate change has costs.
3294 2018-06-13 17:55:37 But have you had their chicken? They cook it in peanut oil! It’s incredibly good!!
3295 2018-06-13 17:55:33 Looking forward to the @SCDInews dinner tonight at @CrownePlaza at @ABZ_Airport in partnership with @WBD_UK with Andy Samuel, Chief Executive, Oil & Gas Authority @OGAuthority #Aberdeen #Energy @emmashearer10

If you can use lavender oil for the mental relaxation kick for for that too. Painkillers don't work for me.
3297 2018-06-13 17:55:19 Me and the wife have been a bit bored recently so today we both did something about it. 

I went out and bought baby oil (buy one get one free at Tesco) 

She went out and bought a game called bananagrams. She’s 28 going on 68 FFS

3301 2018-06-13 17:54:58 Ite so I’ve finally found a shampoo, conditioner and oil combo and really quenches my dry hairs thirst.
3302 2018-06-13 17:54:40 Oil price is up due to a Moron screwed up a deal with Iran.
3303 2018-06-13 17:54:38 Is it a waste if they are sucking up otherwise wasted or loose capacity ?
3304 2018-06-13 17:54:37 Was there any discussion on the record about oil-gas-power exit? They were in those businesses in early 1990s so they the opportunity, but just never made it big. Maybe another article sometime?
3305 2018-06-13 17:54:33 Lol, look up the Bush's links Vice President Cheney’s former firm, Halliburton, which is involved in both Pentagon contracting and oil and gas ventures, has given 86% of its contributions to Republican candidates"
3306 2018-06-13 17:54:33 I fixed it for you: Oil Prices are too high,Trump is at it again.Not looking good!
3307 2018-06-13 17:54:32 Best to buy ORGANIC Hemp/Cannabis oil, guaranteed no GMOs.   The use of this oil dates back centuries as a homeopathic medicine.
3308 2018-06-13 17:54:24 It has for me atleast, since I stopped doing all the stupid stuff I was doing I didn’t wanna get put back on prescription pills so my mom suggested CBD oil and other CBD products and its worked really well for me!

3310 2018-06-13 17:54:12 I'm sorry. I really don't have time to dig you out of the cesspit of a hole you've dug for yourself. Independence is a certainty. Even Tories admit it, but fight one last ditch battle to keep our oil. By the way, if I find a white flag I'll throw it to you.
3311 2018-06-13 17:54:03 Really?? So, tough guy, what are you going to do about it? BTW - guess it's not in the 'Fun with Dick and Jane' book you are reading that we get over 15% of our oil from Canada. Not smart on your part to insult our friends to the north. Put that on your burger and eat it.
3312 2018-06-13 17:53:56 I am so in to arugula and provolone right now.  Super cold- olive oil, lemon, salt, black pepper. Inhale inhale inhale.

3315 2018-06-13 17:53:54 You come for an oil change and they start telling you 10,000 other things
3316 2018-06-13 17:53:54 Their strength lies in group consensus.18 months ago there was talk of OPEC no longer having relevance with US shale taking the crown as swing producer but since then they cut and rebalanced global market raising oil in the process. World again waits & reacts to their decisions.
3317 2018-06-13 17:53:46 At a resent oil venue
  I asked the question, " why is gas  prices so high"
Their answer was "  we have more oil then  we can refine"
Hmmm, "so build more refineries."
Dont need to be a brain surgeon to figure that out.
3318 2018-06-13 17:53:44 God that gave us crude oil and we using it anyhow with nothing to show... He won't give us The World cup 
3319 2018-06-13 17:53:35 Greenies & child protesters think they r svng planet but instead are saving oil 4 US
3320 2018-06-13 17:53:33 And, let's underline that the #1 source of primary energy in Germany is oil (electricity is only a fraction of total energy use).
3321 2018-06-13 17:53:32 And those prices benefit #Russia because oil and arms are its only economic resources
3322 2018-06-13 17:53:25 Getting an oil change and Fox News is on at the waiting room. 
3323 2018-06-13 17:53:24 My step father had leukemia,went into remission for 14 years,but passed away 5 years ago after it returned with a vengeance and a stem cell transplant failure.I know this would have helped him so much. I just got my first shipment of HempBomb’s CBD oil last week and I LOVE IT!
3324 2018-06-13 17:53:24 I'm afraid fossil companies are gonna jack this one since they got the know-how, the equipment and the empty gas fields and oil wells to store the CO2. But they got a bad reputation on safety and honesty from what I heard... And they're gonna need the money #strandedassest

3329 2018-06-13 17:52:59 Yup it's all good and I appreciate your civility and points of view. If we don't have strong views as traders, we aren't really trading. I'll give you my answer on where the dollar and oil are headed based on the FOMC raising rates by 0.25%.
3330 2018-06-13 17:52:52 On his day off he went and got my oil changed, got the dog a crate and is figuring out how to put it together and all so we can take her safely on our trip in July 
3331 2018-06-13 17:52:48 oil rallied because of the data as for tesla i agree
3332 2018-06-13 17:52:41 It almost seems like putting Iran, Venezuela, Syria, Yemen, Qatar out of the international oil market and letting UAE and Saudis do what they please is not good for the rest of the world, eh?

3334 2018-06-13 17:52:34 It cost oil companies pennies per gallon to produce gasoline. This is all BS to allow the Oil Industry to deny climate change caused by carbon dioxide.
3335 2018-06-13 17:52:29 Oil base paint is the devil 
3336 2018-06-13 17:52:29 Got my @PurpulHair shampoo, conditioner and oil 10 weeks back...feeling like it's growing so slowly. Am I being impatient?
3337 2018-06-13 17:52:28 Back at it again with the oil change
3338 2018-06-13 17:52:27 i need an oil change , i hate waiting up there tho 
3339 2018-06-13 17:52:22 true. Who will buy their oil?
3340 2018-06-13 17:52:19 Frgn $ 2 stop r pipelines so landloked oil can b part of US Strategic Reserve is bad
3341 2018-06-13 17:52:09 I did much research on Organic Cannabis oil - right now Swanson Vitamins has a great deal on Nutiva, highly rated organic Hemp/cannabis oil, 40% sale compared to Ebay and Amazon.
3342 2018-06-13 17:52:06 Oil prices are high because of Trumps feckless buffoonery and terrible policy decisions, most notably his rash and stupid withdrawal demo the Iran agreement -
3343 2018-06-13 17:52:01 Quick observation; oil prices were $112 when Obama was in office. Prices have stabilized, even dropped as of late to the $75 range and lower.  So, he's asking for even lower prices than we'd normally have during a cyclical increase. Great analysis Ned, sheesh,
3344 2018-06-13 17:51:56  CBD oil
3345 2018-06-13 17:51:49 its fuel oil because you have to crack the fuel oil to be able to get the other fractions as this was the one that was produced on the highest scale, petrol was the one that was most in demand, therefore you wouldnt crack petrol because overall you would end up with less petrol
3346 2018-06-13 17:51:47 احد معها organic coconut oil

3352 2018-06-13 17:51:05 guna bio oil! its like a magic
3353 2018-06-13 17:51:02 Guess you want a seat at the oil magnate's table, ask and it shall be given to you don't tweet!!!
3354 2018-06-13 17:50:47 What I gathered from the article is that one of the main reasons we use soya oil is because the livestock trade demands so much soya meal, which makes the oil cheaper and more readily available. Wouldn't a reduction in meal consumption be more likely to result in reduced oil use?
3355 2018-06-13 17:50:41 Sir, for as long as I remember, the "oil companies" have been pulling this same "stunt" just prior to EVERY HOLIDAY TRAVEL SEASON! 
  In an America that keeps on falling for the same "scam" that threatens to interfere with WHAT THEY WANT, what ya gonna do? 
3356 2018-06-13 17:50:36 im starting to realize that coconut oil doesnt really do anything for my hair. i need to find a different styling product that doesnt have that in it
3357 2018-06-13 17:50:30 funding protestrs to keep r oil in the ground 2 be relied on by USA in future is bad
3358 2018-06-13 17:50:29 Huh! That would raise oil prices even more. Did you sleep through college economics? Prices went up because he scrapped the Iran deal. His donors wanted these high prices. Prices were too low and opec slowed production. He’s playing you.
3359 2018-06-13 17:50:18 Rubbing lavender oil on your feet before bed helps a lot with anxiety and insomnia
3360 2018-06-13 17:50:18 Turbines run on oil and the turbines are known to leak oil.
3361 2018-06-13 17:50:13 Seriously, I'm asking.

Renewable energy is better for the environment, better for the economy, and, depending on the source, is already cheaper than or will soon be cheaper than coal and oil.

How can anyone POSSIBLY object to this?
3362 2018-06-13 17:50:12 personally i love making a simple kinda stirfry. ground meat, packaged sauce or one you make yrself with hoisin & sesame oil, and a nice base of jasmine rice.
3363 2018-06-13 17:50:10 The sad thing is the moderate people in England and pretty much all of Wales don't want you to leave, but we are pushing Scotland into a corner, you voted to stay in the EU we don't care say England.  Westminster taking powers away from you, taking profits from your gas and Oil.
3364 2018-06-13 17:50:02 Olive oil and sugar always win over my other body scrubs. Always!
3365 2018-06-13 17:49:56 I bring my own hair oil to appointments...so as soon as they finish my foundation I pull it out.
3366 2018-06-13 17:49:54 I just ordered organic Cannabis oil, many positive reviews, it does not have the element which is in pot for a high.  However, it is a relief from stress, pains, good for diet, hair and skin.  I am trying it and I will let you know my review soon.  I am waiting for it, try it out
3367 2018-06-13 17:49:51 lol  *hugs*   I got some butterfly pasta with hemp seeds, olive oil, and caesar dressing. :-)  

I hope you're having a great trip! 
3368 2018-06-13 17:49:39 Patently true. Snake oil salesmen have better reputations.
3369 2018-06-13 17:49:39 Efficascent oil is heart boi.
3370 2018-06-13 17:49:30 U ok bro? Need sum oil? Hydro fluid? Electrical shock? Memory? You can get it at @Walmart
3371 2018-06-13 17:49:15 ...pay off my creditors and live off the rest of the oil
3372 2018-06-13 17:49:11 oh!イル
3373 2018-06-13 17:49:01 We export our raw materials like Cocoa & import Chocolates.
We export leather & crude oil & import shoes & refined petroleum,Creating jobs in countries for other nations. Nigeria needs a compulsory #FarmToFactory policy Inplace. We cannot keep exporting our jobs to other nations
3374 2018-06-13 17:48:48 With more U S sources, we should be able to dictate oil prices - at least for our own consumption.  We need to stop all oil imports now that we are becoming the world's most oil-rich nation.  Great opportunity for decreasing the trade imbalance and becoming totally independent.
3375 2018-06-13 17:48:39 You need to drop the modifier. The problem isn’t ‘OPEC oil’. It’s oil, period. An overwhelming 92% share in transportation is a monopoly, not a market. Unless and until we diversify the U.S and global fuel markets, OPEC will do its thing.
3376 2018-06-13 17:48:34 SENATOR IF YOU FEEL WEAK ONCE A DAY HAVE A PIECE OF GRILLED SALMON WITH LEMON OR GRILLED TUNISINI EGGPLANTS OR BOILED RED PEPPERS STUFFED WITH GARLIC OLIVE OIL BREAD CRUMBS!'THESE FOODS WILL SATISFY YOUR APPETITE WHILE NOT FEEDING YOUR CANCER DO THERAPY!

3384 2018-06-13 17:47:34 everyone needs to invest in an oil diffuser. I just got one and it has changed my life.
3385 2018-06-13 17:46:50 Oil rallies after Trump called oil prices too high this morning. 

TSLA rallies after cutting jobs despite being a "growth story"

Your markets ladies & gentlemen.
3386 2018-06-13 17:46:33 Not really, unless you think meat has the capacity to hoover up the cost of the oil then any reduction in oil consumption will lead to less production.
3387 2018-06-13 17:46:28 Canada: let's make more oil! YAY!
3388 2018-06-13 17:46:22 I need that Purpul hair oil and Aloe spray
3389 2018-06-13 17:46:11 my mistake

3390 2018-06-13 17:46:05 I would have loved to be able to show people what the sites look like, but when I worked at oil and gas sites, you'd lose your job for taking photos. Not even supposed to have your phone on you outside of the break room.
3391 2018-06-13 17:45:49 We are like oil and water but still we insist. Khona ozofa
3392 2018-06-13 17:45:46 If it’s a pimple with a pus, drying lotion works better. Tea tree oil might take some time but it’ll work (hopefully). BUUUUUUT use anything that has salicylic acid because that really helps reduce acne breakouts. Don’t forget to cleanse, exfoliate, toner, moisturise!
3393 2018-06-13 17:45:38 I just filled my oil and windshield fluid by myself so I guess I’m a mechanic now
3394 2018-06-13 17:45:34 Ryan Zinke wants allow the Yellowstone brown bears to be hunted by trophy hunters . The bears in small numbers are hampering gas and oil companies from drilling in their habitat. Zinke wants them killed.
3395 2018-06-13 17:45:34 There's too much demand for the supply.  Oil prices have gone up because YOU put embargo on Iran's oil!  Urge people to buy hybrids & electric cars & price of oil will go down.  Have you ever thought of this approach?
3396 2018-06-13 17:45:29 Dude, I've read the story. Kenya has plenty of start-up oil distributors who end up adulterating fuel that's destroying all Turbo charged VW Golfs. A cardinal sin in my book. How can they compete with the Kenyatta clan ?
3397 2018-06-13 17:45:19 "leeching", seems to me as your number one consumer of American goods and your single largest foreign oil producer America has benefitted substantially from Canada.  How about we turn the tap off.
3398 2018-06-13 17:44:59 Basket of tomato is #12k

3399 2018-06-13 17:44:54 Right before I die, I want someone to tell me the exact number of times I have googled “healthy breakfasts,” scanned the first three links, then eaten a bowl of noodles with olive oil and parmesan at 11:30am.

3404 2018-06-13 17:43:47 Get baby oil and leave it on u for 20 mins and then get into the shower, if works so well
3405 2018-06-13 17:43:45 MRCA ( UK supplement police) are even restricting freedom  to buy non psychoactive #CBD oil...it won’t be long before last bottles seen in #health stores, it’s all tosh really much hypocrisy and part of a global scheme to stop  people getting cured so they keep on taking meds !!
3406 2018-06-13 17:43:44 and very easy to do
just smash potato, dry, no like cream
tortillas
boiled in deep oil
and that's it
3407 2018-06-13 17:43:38 Understood. Venezuela nationalized it's oil industry in order to promote the general welfare by keeping gas prices really low. Would  nationalizing our oil industry not also qualify as promoting general welfare?
3408 2018-06-13 17:43:37 This is our chance. The future of the Arctic Refuge is about to be decided. Join me and @TheWCS to say "Absolutely no drilling for oil and gas in the Arctic Refuge" http://1/#.WyFXx2M6kO8.twitter
3409 2018-06-13 17:43:25 And I'd be inclined to agree that there are better oils than soya oil out there.
3410 2018-06-13 17:43:24 It's sad when the so called leaders are in 2022 campaign moods while the generation that should vote is being whiped by poisonous sugar, cooking oil, detergents. But they don't care coz the SERVER will vote
3411 2018-06-13 17:43:19 For the price cycle the negative CI are what I'm (im)patiently waiting for. Think they are about to start accelerating. If they don't Brent needs to rise more, as oil is not getting out to meet the demand. Biggest bet of my life.
3412 2018-06-13 17:42:54 Either OPEC, or your Energy Dept's strategies to focus on fossil fuel usage as opposed to developing alternative energy sources.....leading to speculative rise in oil futures.....  But then again, you're the one who went to Saudi and kissed ass, so you might be on to something.
3413 2018-06-13 17:42:44 Slapping sanctions back on Iran, an oil-producing country, restricts supply and raises prices. Russia's economy is heavily dependent on oil revenues - I wonder if it's just a coincidence you ripped up the Iran deal for no reason with no backup plan & Putin benefits?
3414 2018-06-13 17:42:39 May well be, he’s still building that crude oil pipeline through First Nations land, right?

3417 2018-06-13 17:42:26 I’m concerned about the safety of our public (yes, that’s public not private) lands that you want to hand over to oil, gas, and other exploitative and environmentally dangerous industries. So take your ‘safety’ PSA and stick it.
3418 2018-06-13 17:42:11 Yes, I think it matters. In one case, the soy oil industry and its supporters are the drivers of soya-related deforestation, with the livestock industry just efficiently hoovering up the waste material. That gets livestock farming off the hook, when really it's driving demand.
3419 2018-06-13 17:42:07 men are so fucking annoying sometimes!!! one time this guy tried to put coconut oil on my coochie and i was like bitch that will give me a yeast infection this man deadass argued with me like he fucking knows

Are you trying to will the price to lower?

3430 2018-06-13 17:41:22 Oh wait, nothing you did might have had anything to do with the, right?

Oh yeah, you tanked the Iran deal which destabilized the region and raised oil prices so Russia and OPEC benefit but you had *nothing* to do with that.

Sad!

3436 2018-06-13 17:40:47 So why all the anti-Canada rhetoric from Trump? Do you think Canada has been sharing damaging intel with #Mueller? Do you think @JustinTrudeau has the conspiracy information or #kompromat on @realDonaldTrump? Do you think Trump wants to give #Putin Canada's Arctic oil?
3437 2018-06-13 17:40:47 @realDonaldTrump We are really getting gigged for gasoline in Western Pennsylvania, Commander. Can we work toward using Our own oil resources more? I always did wonder why the oil rich countries couldn't pay us in oil, for the things we do for them! Time to BREAK FREE from OPEC!

3451 2018-06-13 17:40:00 Well, this day freaking sucks. And I still have the rest of my work day, my oil change, and babysitting to get through.
3452 2018-06-13 17:39:58 Trump remember me to another president from the other extreme of political spectrum, who rule an oil country of South America without bath paper.
3453 2018-06-13 17:39:57 There is a farm in Barnsgreen near Horsham that make Linseed Oil. Could be theirs
3454 2018-06-13 17:39:51 Your skin so smooth , what do you use ? 
 Virgin coconut oil & water ! 
3455 2018-06-13 17:39:49 Trump controls OPEC now? OPEC is just upping prices again now that a lot of the exploration/ drilling efforts were driven down with their forced low oil prices. you should look up the book "Economics for Dummies."
3456 2018-06-13 17:39:47 Does it really matter which way you spin it? The outcome is the same - eat less soy oil and meal.

3459 2018-06-13 17:39:42 @nedprice Not 100% accurate.  The Saudis have been wanting to jack the prices up all year.  Nothing Trump did "caused" and increase in oil prices.  Prices are so freaking artificially jacked up every few years that it's completely predictable.  Excuses are cheap, oil should be.

3462 2018-06-13 17:39:35 Pollution from coal and oil may also cause harm.  Harm from lead paint and lead gasoline in USA many years after other countries banned.

3467 2018-06-13 17:39:07 Ok, maybe TMI but I only truly wash my hair once a week. Otherwise I just use a cleansing conditioner or “co-wash”. Over-washing my hair makes it dry and frizzy. Also I use a hair oil while wet through the ends. 
3468 2018-06-13 17:38:51 @realDonaldTrump 
Put Christie in charge of the CFTC. And get the speculation out of the oil market.  If all the hedge funds and speculators took off their positions oil would be 10 to 15 dollars cheaper.
3469 2018-06-13 17:38:48 Why do we export oil and at the same time import oil?
3470 2018-06-13 17:38:46 Best economy in the history of the universe exporting energy...I don't get it. OPEC is run by authoritarian governments.  Your bailiwick. As soon as you cut prices for a stay at your hotels, they will cut oil prices.  For a free trade guy, you impose a lotta government pressure.
3471 2018-06-13 17:38:44 Kudos to @MattPawa for arguing superbly before SDNY in support of NYC lawsuit against oil companies seeking compensation for losses due to sea level rise. Claim is simple but elegant & impeccable: companies committed intentional tort by selling product they knew would cause harm.
3472 2018-06-13 17:38:42 Why not rely on our own oil which would make the price go down and give Americans jobs? We have enough oil in the US to take of ourselves and sell or save. We just have to get it.

3475 2018-06-13 17:38:36 Here is the stupidly of the left. Trump is doing Russia's bidding. Lets see, Russia is a huge oil and natural gas exporter. Yet, Trump has rolled back Obama's restrictions on domestic drilling. How does more energy being produced in US help Russa?
3476 2018-06-13 17:38:19 Yep it’s ace. 600 bread flour, packet of fast yeast, tsp salt, 2 tbls olive oil, 340 ml warm water

3478 2018-06-13 17:38:05 Trump is a bullshit artist. It’s not about the truth of the substance but the sale of the substance. Sometimes his bullshitting is correct, like a broken clock being right twice a day, but that’s incidental. Usually his bullshitting is just the stuff of a snake oil salesman.

3494 2018-06-13 17:36:45 Joy Romero every Canadian benefits financially from the oil and gas industry in Canada.  This is not the case for renewable energy. So it is important that Canad invest responsibly in our natural resources to ensure that future generations can continue to benefit from these.
3495 2018-06-13 17:36:42 High oil prices helps Russia, right Trump?

3517 2018-06-13 17:35:12 Trump’s reckless decision to pull out of the Iran deal has led to higher oil prices! These higher oil prices are translating directly to soaring gas prices, that disproportionately hurts middle-and lower-income people, since a larger chunk of their disposable income goes for gas.

3551 2018-06-13 17:32:45 Laying blame in the wrong place again. Oil prices are high because you bailed us out of the Iran Nuclear deal that means 500,000 barrels a day of Iranian production is off the global market. You  need to study and understand economics!

3554 2018-06-13 17:32:31 The other station you speak of upcharges on nearly everything in the store. It's ridiculous. A 30 cent difference is unacceptable when barrels of oil are pretty much uniform across the board.

3556 2018-06-13 17:32:25 Nah - Trump’s backers want to control Arctic oil and shipping & see calved icebergs in shipping channels now. They want a new alliance with RU and US on an equal footing and evidently would destroy our republic to get there.

3562 2018-06-13 17:32:05 Oil and water don’t mix!
3563 2018-06-13 17:32:01 Oil is a global commodity traded in spot and futures markets around the world among speculators, risk managers, and end users. Global supply is affected by OPEC. Global demand due to strong economy drives higher prices.  So explain exactly how higher oil prices falls on DJT 100%?
3564 2018-06-13 17:32:01 Ur arrogance shows ur fall is not far.wait .
3565 2018-06-13 17:31:56 There is no future for coal. It’s unfortunate for those who work in that field but that’s the truth. I do t see why we can’t focus on gas oil short term while continuing investment in renewables long term. That’s where trump is missing the mark and being short sighted
3566 2018-06-13 17:31:54 Maybe Canada should join OPEC?
Our oil is vital to US security.

3568 2018-06-13 17:31:29 You are right. Comes down to short term greed and an odd mix of loons who are convinced that the rapture is going to save all of us (well, not exactly all). Meanwhile we are doubling down on coal & oil. What could possibly go wrong.

3579 2018-06-13 17:30:46 Additionally, it's possible that American dollars were used to keep Iranian oil valued by the American dollar.

At one point, Sadaam Hussein tried to convert Iraqi oil sales to a strictly gold currency.

Iran may have tried the same. 

That's a theory of mine.

PS...Canada can just turn off that Keystone Oil pipeline.  Just shut it down.

Trump has no idea what he is doing.

3589 2018-06-13 17:30:13 A real tourist trap! (and locals). The wonderful thinkers in Calgary made sure to target the roads leading to and from the airport, with speed limits that rise and fall faster than the oil prices, to welcome unaware visitors to our city. #YYC of giving "leis" and saying #Aloha!
3590 2018-06-13 17:30:08 Or thought it was a good time to make a move. But...I guess we'll just have to see how it plays out. I think I'm done pouring oil on the fire.

3608 2018-06-13 17:28:29 NK has a long history of trading 'remains' for, heavy oil, food and even light water nuclear reactor.
They have even negotiated millions of dollars from US for remains.
This is nothing new.
3609 2018-06-13 17:28:22 This is gonna sound dumb but holy shit there's actual oil in those pans in Mario Party and I don't think I've seen that in cooking graphics yet?
3610 2018-06-13 17:28:21 Well Mr. Schumer, propose relaxing the Federal tax on fuel and pass it along in tariffs to OPEC till price per barrel oil comes down.
3611 2018-06-13 17:28:19 I tried coconut oil to shave my legs because I ran out of shaving cream and I’m probably late to the party but holy shit my legs are so smooth and it wasn’t messy and I smell amazing

3613 2018-06-13 17:28:14 But the fun thing, is that trump.... By mentioning this AS the president of the United States ... Will cause a run and buy of oil ... Making it go up in price even faster.
3614 2018-06-13 17:27:52 As long as they have money & oil.
3615 2018-06-13 17:27:49 The mission my elders sent me on is one of communicating to NY, DC, TX the extortion is over, We The People will refine our own oil from now on, again, as was the case before EPA senate and house gestapo shut it down for their islamic terrorist supporting buddies of TX, NY & DC.
3616 2018-06-13 17:27:48 Let these dolts ask to ban oil from those countries...
3617 2018-06-13 17:27:48 Yet YOU encouraged higher prices for oil and discouraged research into renewable sources. Oil prices ARE too high - and we can directly trace that back to your idiotic policies.

3624 2018-06-13 17:27:21 You allow selling of our  USA oil abroad. You are why our oil/gas is so high. You bragged about it in an interview not long ago.  Profits taken from the pockets of our workers. Be honest! You are hurting those who support you.
3625 2018-06-13 17:27:15 How many people does it take to take off an oil cap? 5 and a crescent wrench. Good god. All I wanted was to top off the truck with oil. But noooo, truck had to be difficult.
3626 2018-06-13 17:27:15 Unfortunately by the time we got around to defending Kuwait we mostly had to quench oil field fires. An ounce of prevention? But I understand your point.
3627 2018-06-13 17:27:11 No recipe, just something I randomly threw together. Cooked the chorizo, add the steam cauliflower rice to that pan w some olive oil and veggies with some cumin and chili powder. Scooped out the middle of the pepper, added the mixture with some cheese and broiled like 5 mins
3628 2018-06-13 17:27:07 Then stop selling our oil to European countries and you can stop buying oil from OPEC
3629 2018-06-13 17:27:05 Oil prices are too high, OPEC is at it again. Not good!

Please note that I have done nothing to fix this. Other than take more land away from Native Americans and ruin their natural resources due to oil leaks.

But fuck all that. Remember: 
I brought back CLEAN COAL, baby!
3630 2018-06-13 17:27:02 When you’re getting your oil change but it’s already done but the shop workers are to busy reving your car in the garage 
3631 2018-06-13 17:26:55 We pretty much do already.

And Trump is talking about barrels of oil on the commodities market, not prices of gasoline.

When price of oil per barrel goes up, that's worldwide.  It doesn't matter where you pump it.
3632 2018-06-13 17:26:33 OPEC just lowered oil prices!  Another trump unreality!
3633 2018-06-13 17:26:30 Kola Buhari! Oil prices to your rescue
3634 2018-06-13 17:26:28 Well, it's so much easier to get oil tankers up there without all that nasty white stuff in the way.

3636 2018-06-13 17:26:26 I sit back and watch the world through eye holes and my oil paintings
3637 2018-06-13 17:26:26 So ... oil price spike becomes more likely? (In that case, would it come before a recession / slowdown, or even catalyze it?)
3638 2018-06-13 17:26:12 It is Trump's fault oil prices are rising. I got no tax relief, and prices for everything are rising because of Trump's tariffs and the instability he is causing around the world.
3639 2018-06-13 17:25:21 Nope. I have a few things I to bc this ain't my first bump. 1. Put a warm face towel on it and  press. 2. Brew chamomile tea and soak it on a wash cloth and press. Sea salt + warm water + 1-2 drops tea tree oil.
3640 2018-06-13 17:25:14 Interesting.  You brag and take credit for low oil prices, but blame OPEC when they are high.  Sounds like hypocrisy to us.
3641 2018-06-13 17:25:01 Not OPEC. It’s your pulling out of the Iran deal and the uncertainty that follows that is affecting oil prices. But you’re smart, right?!

3647 2018-06-13 17:24:40 The push for oil and coal now is to become energy independent. That has to happen first since we have to have it. He wants us to be a self-sustaining country. The electric grid is weak to cyber threats from what I hear.

3674 2018-06-13 17:22:10 Putin is fortunate that Russia has oil or their economy would be in even worse shape. Putin is like any other Dictator & his theft of the people’s money has made him a billionaire. To be fair, the Russians have a higher standard of living than during the USSR reign of terror.
3675 2018-06-13 17:22:06 A vague statement with no accountability or concrete promises is not a deal. Thus, referring to this as a "deal" is already inaccurate. There is nothing to sell but snake oil and hot air.

3683 2018-06-13 17:21:24 I love watercolor and oil equally. Watercolor for the transparency and brilliance and oil for it’s textured brush strokes
3684 2018-06-13 17:20:58 Tbs tea tree oil sm sabun nya abis, gak keburu beli karna mudik alhasil itu botol sabun diisi air macam kemelaratan sabun mandi. Pdhl tu sabun busa nya jg gak ada, cuci muka sm air2 jg sih ini mah
3685 2018-06-13 17:20:55 If you didn’t sanction Iran, the oil prices wouldn’t be as high.
3686 2018-06-13 17:20:52 OPEC with 12 oil exporting countries. It's duty to formulate policies for continuous supply of oil for stabilization. Out of 12 countries 2 countries that are Iran and Venezuela facing political turmoil. Oil price purposely hiked to create fake inflation in certain countries?
3687 2018-06-13 17:20:41 #lynx #Africa ordered should be here soon
3688 2018-06-13 17:20:41 Really want a tuna sub w/ tomato lettuce , olives and maybe some oil and vinegar
3689 2018-06-13 17:20:41 Asian food has more oil than Saudi Arabia.
3690 2018-06-13 17:20:36 What I would say is always watch out every 4 to 6 months for a oil company placing on average... it’s hard to grasp at times cash positions with all this wage rises lol
3691 2018-06-13 17:20:32 Lol wrong about consumption.  Like it telied on oil at the moment
3692 2018-06-13 17:20:14 Also...I was wondering

3695 2018-06-13 17:19:43 Sir. USA is a big producer now. Pump up the oil and reduce the price. No need to blame OPEC. They will toe your line like many others 
3696 2018-06-13 17:19:40 Imagine how stupid you have to be as an MP laughing as you lose Scotland from the UK with its huge oil reserves, whisky sales, and vast fishing grounds #brexitshambles #DissolveTheUnion 
3697 2018-06-13 17:19:25 GCSE edexcel: what fraction of crude oil was cracked? #edexcelchemistry
3698 2018-06-13 17:19:14 Khrushchev said they would sell us the rope they would hang us with. OPEC is selling us gas to finance our own destruction. We should end buying Saudi oil, and end support for any country that still does.

3705 2018-06-13 17:18:26 What about our oil reserves? You could liwer prices if you wanted to! Also this "summer blend" price raise is a joke, I worked oil and it's all fake!
3706 2018-06-13 17:18:23 I will accept no money from big oil or any other special interest. Straight up grassroots - my goal is to serve you, not to buy a seat in Congress.
3707 2018-06-13 17:17:57 You’ve had 124 years and you’ve won only 5....
You only won 4% of the titles in that span... and 3 of them came after oil money.
Check yourself
3708 2018-06-13 17:17:56 This oil spray i have kinda smells like cherries & ass
3709 2018-06-13 17:17:49 As long as the money is there to keep giving Big Oil tax breaks, because they’ll take the oil with them when they leave. We all know Big Pharma needs me, and others, hooked on their products. So Yen and others happily take their money to keep us strung out.
3710 2018-06-13 17:17:47 O e thing the don't teach at uni is common sence.
3711 2018-06-13 17:17:46 The oil prices have been going higher for months. Where  have you been?
3712 2018-06-13 17:17:45 20mins to debate the brexshit impact on Scotland, fillibustered by anti democratic Tory buffoon, proves the contempt unionists hold all Scots in, including you no voters btw. They want our taxes, oil, soldiers etc but don't want us having a voice. Time to leave

3722 2018-06-13 17:16:42 the lil piece of oil shot right through the collector because she dipped it so fast/hard 
3723 2018-06-13 17:16:29 Jamaican Black castor oil and massage it in for 5 minutes to stimulate the blood flow
3724 2018-06-13 17:16:26 DYK? A Canadian oil sands mining operation is already producing oil with a lower env footprint than the average North American barrel? @JPLinteau @PrairiesTCS
3725 2018-06-13 17:16:21 Lmao no  it was one time. I was young and rebellious so they forced me to cook thenone time and I went to watch tv instead of being in he kitchen watching the oil get hot. I was scolded  badly.
3726 2018-06-13 17:16:19 4800 liters is about 3 barrels of oil. Not a significant spill.

3729 2018-06-13 17:15:51 Oil means big business no matter where you go. We've got @RagheeHorner back on the show as we examine everything OPEC and oil! #OPEC #oil
3730 2018-06-13 17:15:50 Oil prices have been pushed higher by geopolitical factors such as heightened tensions in Syria, the threat of new sanctions on Iran and unrest in Venezuelan oil fields.
3731 2018-06-13 17:15:49 No good, indeed. Entirely your fault as well, dipshit. You pulled the plug on the Iran nuclear deal just because Obama accomplished it and you were jealous of that fact. How much oil did we lose access to as a result? Actions and words have consequences. #ResignNow
3732 2018-06-13 17:15:48 When you are a black bald and bearded man; Shea butter, Coconut Oil and Castor oil automatically become your best friends. At least for many of us.

3735 2018-06-13 17:15:23 With no clarity on external account front, USD ever increasing tendency, Oil prices hike and inflationary pressures- The next couple of years could be extremely clumsy for Pakistan economy. Fingers crossed but when will our policy makers learn.
3736 2018-06-13 17:15:21 My point again, there's no predictive value only a guess & guessing doesn't translate to longevity in this business. Just for fun, a 0.25% increase will do what to the dollar and oil?
3737 2018-06-13 17:15:19 so i have no weed right and u know the logical thing would be to just wait for my dealer but no instead i spent 80 dollars on an oil pen #noregrets
3738 2018-06-13 17:15:18 #OPEC Officially hijacking the #WorldCup "Russian President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman meet in Moscow tomorrow to discuss oil policy on the sidelines of the opening match of the Football World Cup."
3739 2018-06-13 17:15:18 The price of oil is only up $3-4 per barrel so that can’t be the reason. 

What we desperately need are more refineries so we can produce more gas and while we’re at it, let’s stop this nonsense with the summer mix and winter mix. It’s all BS.
3740 2018-06-13 17:15:07 Could it be the so-called developing world is paying the price for world stability and peace? If the next POTUS is a Trump-continuity-would we see the world order change iro NATO disintegration and TPP kicking in? Declining dependency on oil and Iran out of OPEC? #TrumpKimSummit
3741 2018-06-13 17:15:05 Real fats: butter, lard, beef tallow, coconut oil, avocado oil mayo, avocado oil, avocados, olive oil, ghee... 

Bad fats (highly inflammatory): margarine, soybean, canola, corn, cottonseed, sunflower, peanut sesame, rice bran. This is how industry gets rid of agricultural waste.

3744 2018-06-13 17:14:36 Where are the studies on CBD oil ? I am hearing great things from those I know with pain and they quit pain pills now but this needs to be settled now if it's the answer for these illnesses.
3745 2018-06-13 17:14:34 I’m not saying it doesn’t need reform I’m just saying I’ve seen nothing from this administration that is evidence of support for clean/renewable energy. I would love to proved wrong but everything I’ve seen is all about oil / coal
3746 2018-06-13 17:14:30 You do realize that we have alot that America needs ..we own and sell you guys hydro power ...most of the upper states in powered by us Canadians as well as we have the pipeline that we send oil to the states  ..we can cut both ...we also helped your asses in all the wars FYI

3753 2018-06-13 17:13:43 In theory, but show me a profitable trading system based on the inverse relationship between the dollar & oil? For ex, the drop in oil occurred around the same time as the drop in the dollar & past 2 weeks each have risen slightly,oh wait,I thought it was an inverse relationship?
3754 2018-06-13 17:13:43 A large part of my life every June is hiding my hands when I go places because it’s impossible to remove all of the grease and oil from my calluses
3755 2018-06-13 17:13:41 Echoes Iraq's Luaibi.... Even if the politics suggest Iran and Iraq diverging sharply now outside of oil....
3756 2018-06-13 17:13:35 You think the nuclear deal we pulled out of with Iran is causing oil prices to climb? If that is true, are you insinuating that Iran is retaliating?
3757 2018-06-13 17:13:34 @SuperdrugHelp Received a damaged order, all items dumped in a box with no packing material. Oil cleanser got smashed up and leaked on everything. E-mail and Facebook message ignored. How do I get refunded?

3768 2018-06-13 17:13:05 That's a really broad reading of "general welfare".
Do you interpret that phrase to mean the feds can nationalize any industry that promotes "general welfare"? The Oil Industry, for example, to keep our gas prices at a low level? Facebook, so we don't bully each other?
3769 2018-06-13 17:13:01 What's that brown stuff stuck on your nose? London is falling down. We've already got the bridge. You need to pay more attention to losing your own culture, values and traditions...And wallets!

3808 2018-06-13 17:08:45 Gonna head there after I get my oil changed.
3809 2018-06-13 17:08:30 Totally up to you, the canola oil starts getting a little weird over time so that's the biggest concern.
3810 2018-06-13 17:08:26 Iran just signed an oil and gas deal with China. 
That should help.
3811 2018-06-13 17:08:23 In that sense it's fair enough but still I think it's a bit harsh marketing veggie food when it's going to be cooked in the same oil as meat/handled with tongs used to pick up meat and stuff.
3812 2018-06-13 17:08:16 But Isn't US oil production higher than consumption?

3814 2018-06-13 17:08:09 And @JustinTrudeau isn’t doing it against the oil industry. Now that’s looking after your own countries wellbeing
3815 2018-06-13 17:08:08 I think it's a fair point that NK is less isolated than in the past, whether via expats working in China or oil imports or other trade, therefore more susceptible to pressure from their trade partners,  so more easy to sway.
3816 2018-06-13 17:08:06 Westminster MPs jeered and sang "bye" as the majority of Scotland's elected representatives left the chamber.  Let's see how sweet they sing when we take our oil, gas, energy, fishing waters, agriculture, tourism etc and tell them to get tae!  #Yes

3832 2018-06-13 17:06:18 I’ve been scared to go back to using oil as moisturizer bc I have oily skin  does it make your skin feel greasy or anything??
3833 2018-06-13 17:06:08 Wish I could be there to see you, Kim -- you're doing a great job, and miss seeing you.  Breakfast at Mi Casita was great! Quick advice -- after the meet and greet, cross the street to the Silver Grizzly coffee shop and/or Oil Horse Brewery (if open). Lots of voters you can meet.
3834 2018-06-13 17:05:39 In theory, but in reality the value of the dollar is the same as it was 2 years ago when oil was $45 a barrel
3835 2018-06-13 17:05:36 We know you are busy #MAGA but this does need attention. I read SA and Russia are increasing output but we need close to $2.00 gas to keep the economy humming.
I have a great idea on how oil can benefit the American people if you ever want to hear it.
3836 2018-06-13 17:05:32 It’s really good, but if you’re allegeric to peanut oil, don’t go for it since that’s what they fry their food in.

3838 2018-06-13 17:05:19 The part they are missing is oil is finite.  It will end some day and we will all be fuxored.
3839 2018-06-13 17:05:15 Oh please! Yes! Chuck us out. By the way, how will you replace our oil revenues? Tax increases or more spending cuts?
3840 2018-06-13 17:05:15 Ughhh I hate changing my oil , matter fact I hate spending my own money .

3843 2018-06-13 17:04:57 Good point. Presumably the forecasts in the medium-term oil market report were showing something similar, though?
3844 2018-06-13 17:04:43 Maybe if you didn’t pull out of the IRAN DEAL they would be better. Oil prices where much lower under Obama

3849 2018-06-13 17:04:27 Great rant but you forgot oil export. Which is why May is shitting herself in case these idiots up here get independence. The English refineries or what’s left of them can only process North Sea oil. Looking likely 10 quid a litre if krankie gets her way
3850 2018-06-13 17:04:20 Can you imagine how advanced the technology would be if we didn’t have the endless cycle of governments propping up oil companies and oil companies propping up politicians.

3855 2018-06-13 17:03:58 I would not. This is just a snake oil salesman-esque way of them trying to get money from you.

3882 2018-06-13 17:00:44 Sorry. I've been busy getting the latest oil and gas business chat in London yesterday and today. Though Jason Naismith is far more exciting and probably worth more money.

3898 2018-06-13 16:59:58 You also forget to realize all countries that really havent hit their industrialized period (India, Africa, etc) are going to contribute immense greenhouse gases still as oil based energy has to come before renewable.   It's unavoidable

3915 2018-06-13 16:59:04 And where is the US production on this? Thought WE didn’t have to rely on foreign oil because YOU released reserves & opened new fields. How much Alaskan oil still goes to China & how is that oil accounted for in our trade with China. YOUR fuel production companies gut Americans.

3928 2018-06-13 16:57:30 I saw the fat, and complete calories after being cooked some years ago. The oil was healthy also bread and cheese used. The only problem was the fat overload for the person eating, this made the calories go up. Many times it is not the food it is the

3933 2018-06-13 16:57:04 A lot of people really do think they're eating so much healthier because it wasn't bought at a fast food restaurant. Meanwhile the portions are ridiculous, the meal isn't balanced and the fat/oil content is WHEW

All is going like that....
3936 2018-06-13 16:56:57 It's not Opec, it's the oil companies making millions,  READ their profit reports monthly and quarterly. Unreal profits, add on the corp. tax break, $ not going to workers as in most companies. I told you it would not trickle down to too many. Proof that is in the greedy pudding.

3954 2018-06-13 16:55:01 Pep boys thought they were gonna charge my ass 80 doll hairs for an oil change lmfaooooooo y'all ain't slick
3955 2018-06-13 16:55:01 Hard guy hard guy but every time I borrow you my note, you must return it with red oil stains on multiple pages.
3956 2018-06-13 16:54:59 Imagine combo  “Survivor Naked & Afraid”
Eric & Don, Jr. & assorted trophy hunters
Dropped at night mid Kruger National park
Olive-oil-marinated carion poured over 
their underwear-clad bodies...
GoPro collars locked on their necks...
The last one running wins...
3957 2018-06-13 16:54:54 Not so. Oil prices went from $110 to $26/bbl and many thousands lost good jobs. We are now just recovering and companies are starting to hire again if prices continue to improve. Many people who voted for you are in oil states so don't forget them
3958 2018-06-13 16:54:42 Duh...Your steel tariffs are totally bad news for the oil industry. The entire oil supply chain like platforms, rigs, pipelines and processing plants rely on steel. No wonder OPEC is hiking prices. Your base will soon be back on horses and carts. #ImpeachTrump
3959 2018-06-13 16:54:38 According to my Facebook timeline... there is an oil convention occurring. I hate that I know these things.
3960 2018-06-13 16:54:04 With the MegaInflation Colorado has experienced since Dems invaded with Oil and Grass...thousands will threaten suicide when housing values drop to 2009 values...

3964 2018-06-13 16:53:59 Oil prices are hurting my grandson who is working full time and going to college full time.  Everytime he gets a break financially like tax cuts, gas prices wipe out the benefits of what you're trying to attain for him and all of us.  America needs to be unaffected by oil prices.
3965 2018-06-13 16:53:58 Oil and gas 
3966 2018-06-13 16:53:36 And the US is oil independent, which means we produce more than we consume on a daily basis.  We are NOT dependent on OPEC countries
3967 2018-06-13 16:53:32 The absoultey accuracy of oil.  The London citizens are  such chavs and scallywags
3968 2018-06-13 16:53:32 candle close counts. that said, 'predictions' are snake oil.
3969 2018-06-13 16:53:31 My day has been filled with waiting on doctors and waiting on my oil to be changed. Waiting at the dmv could only make this worse.
3970 2018-06-13 16:53:26 Pierre Andurand fears people like Jimboman (@oilfractals). People like Jimboman prevent dishonest dirtbags like Andurand from talking the price up to 100+ (or the insane 150+). Hence the trolls. #WTI #OOTT #Oil #CrudeOil #Brent #OPEC #CL_F #Trading #Forex #DXY
3971 2018-06-13 16:53:24 Jamaican black castor oil is working wonders on my locs #RealRastafari
3972 2018-06-13 16:53:23 You know what else is an urgent economic issue for Canadians...Pipelines to all the coasts to ship clean, ethical, oil and natural gas to markets other then the US at world prices NOT huge discounts!...stop the trade hypocrisy.  #TrudeauMustGo
3973 2018-06-13 16:53:20 You assume that Trump is capable of enough attention to analyze anything much less something as complex as oil price.
3974 2018-06-13 16:53:19 At the same time we are laser focused on the gas tax, let's not forget that we have all been suckered by #drillbabydrill
It sure helped domestic big oil to drill, harvest and ship a shit load of domestic crude overseas.
3975 2018-06-13 16:53:11 I work in the financial services sector too so I get excited about funds and oil and gas lmao like what.
3976 2018-06-13 16:52:52 It's not the @OPECnews that is responsible for the oil prize. It's that Guy that canceled the Iran agreement. Politicians have to think first and act afterwards... No Country is strong enough to rule the world....
3977 2018-06-13 16:52:42 Iraq was just started the selling oil
To world again USA try to banned iraq 180 days grace.

Iraq already selling with discounts
So difficult to survive iraq so so.....
3978 2018-06-13 16:52:40 This is our chance. The future of the Arctic Refuge is about to be decided. Join me and @TheWCS to say "Absolutely no drilling for oil and gas in the Arctic Refuge" http://1/#.WyFLyXjNntE.twitter--PLEASE SIGN AND SHARE
3979 2018-06-13 16:52:31 Stop stop stop you know why the oil prices are the way they are you did it you're putting money in Russia's hands you putting money in Putin's hands that's why the oil prices are the way they are
3980 2018-06-13 16:52:23 This tweet is so Trumpian. Do everything in your power to reject clean and renewable energy, then complain about oil prices are too high. Only thing missing is trying to blame it on Hillary
3981 2018-06-13 16:52:18 ..why can't we drill for oil in areas least populated in our own country..like where the schael rocks are in Wyoming & Montana?
3982 2018-06-13 16:52:15 US oil companies should just raise prices in the states that sue them to compensate for lawsuits.
3983 2018-06-13 16:52:07 As long as America allows these foreign oil cartels to control prices we will always have a threat to national security
3984 2018-06-13 16:52:00 Up all the surplus....
Now, YOU try getting 500 rigs back online to drill for needed oil chuckie...
The POTUS got them back online plus a few..
If YOU notice, gas prices are coming down..
It would help if you democrats would quit putting taxes on gas and blame the oil companies !
3985 2018-06-13 16:51:54 Chef when you replied me for the first time on twitter and that time my mom was making bhajiya and I went to kitchen with full of excitement and I stirred the bhajiya speedily on the wok and the hot oil fell down on my hand. And my hand  .... #MyBhajiaMemory
3986 2018-06-13 16:51:44 Let’s buy our own oil and drive down gas prices!
3987 2018-06-13 16:51:30 Don't you love when a natural gas pipeline explodes and it spikes crude oil price.

Insider trading is illegal but manipulating prices with the media completely is legal.

Combine both and you have deepstate who is above all laws...

Follow the money...
3988 2018-06-13 16:51:28 she definitely smells like coconut oil and sunshine
3989 2018-06-13 16:51:25 Website ape hekk.  Yg mne.  Nak cari jugak jalan nak masuk oil n gas sementara tgah blaja kat dungun niii. Huhu. Btw saya student poli dungun course mechanical engineering automotive 
3990 2018-06-13 16:51:25 Trump is at it again, tweeting at 4:52 AM like a crazy person, about a problem he could easily mitigate by not being a spineless lapdog of Russia and the oil & coal industries. Not good!
3991 2018-06-13 16:51:25 Thanks to Twitter, the coconut oil section of the grocery store looks like the milk and bread sections the day before a snow storm.
3992 2018-06-13 16:51:21 But you WANT high oil prices, both to help your Russian friends and the fracking industry, which needs high prices to remain profitable. I suppose it's great for your idiot followers for you to lie about your "concerns" but the rest of us know how the world works.
3993 2018-06-13 16:51:20 I think the lower chart have to break (to the downside) eventually, as I expect that we move away from using oil as energy over MT. Use of oil for chemicals and not for energy consumption can't attract present levels. My 2c.
3994 2018-06-13 16:51:17 Yeaaa bitch mines ain’t none major I cracked a whole in my oil pan ranned over some what idk but it busted my shit

4001 2018-06-13 16:50:30 500,000 barrels a day is nothing.  There are plants in Texas that run that much oil in a day. 500,000 per day is a drop in the bucket. That wouldn’t move the price at all.
4002 2018-06-13 16:50:26 The Saudis also sell oil by dollar and if they decide not! USA will be forgotten tomorrow.
4003 2018-06-13 16:50:25 Just got a free oil change, gas card and visa gift card thanks @chevrolet 
4004 2018-06-13 16:50:22 Getting me oil changed.

Also set up another appointment because sometimes my car thinks I'm leaving the key in the ignition and a window motor doesn't work
4005 2018-06-13 16:50:19 I wonder how his comment today on the price of oil being too high will impact his ND approval
4006 2018-06-13 16:50:16 I just flashed on a horse and wagon with a man peddling cannibus instead of snake oil!

4008 2018-06-13 16:50:09 I know I’m a little late to the party but COCONUT NUT OIL HAS SAVED MY SKIN YALL.. highly suggest putting it all over in the shower and letting the steam do the rest.. seriously the best thing u can do for soft healthy skin 
4009 2018-06-13 16:49:45 Then why are we the world's #1 exporter of crude oil? Why not keep it here at home and keep prices low?
4010 2018-06-13 16:49:45 Put 4 tablespoons of baby oil in your bath water. Your skin will be silky smooth in no time.
4011 2018-06-13 16:49:36 Snake oil salesman strikes again
4012 2018-06-13 16:49:32 Try to be positive 1 day eggs and oil will be in stock at the same time on the site. Till the turn up music and grab a huge coffee!!
4013 2018-06-13 16:49:28 I appreciate $10 oil changes for women so much... thank you @Nissan 
4014 2018-06-13 16:49:21 America should not allow Opec to place a noose around our necks any longer. Ramp up our oil production and keep the money in our nation for our infrastructure. Why should their cities and architecture outshine ours using our money to do so? Makes no sense. #KAG #AmericaFirst
4015 2018-06-13 16:49:17 You can't sleep with Saudis & tell them "your oil prices are too high," just like sleeping with prostitutes & asking for a discount.

4017 2018-06-13 16:49:13 Olive oil becomes more expensive for me to buy, which raises the total raw cost of my soap.. which means i gotta raise prices or take in less profit.

And i might lose sales because of higher prices. and who likes less profits. xd
4018 2018-06-13 16:49:10 Price of gas goes up and down due to the the price of BBL of oil. Oil right now is at upper 60’s and by the way America dosent Control it .. a higher % is controlled by OPEC.  It don’t matter who’s president. Now Taxes that’s a different story buddy.
4019 2018-06-13 16:49:08 Fat from where?? Lol you trying to look like olive oil and i don’t like it
4020 2018-06-13 16:49:01 Omg, my hair was so dry and brittle it felt like straw, so I just rubbed straight canola oil through it and it still feels dry. Better, but dry. Curls are so hard to deal with man.
4021 2018-06-13 16:48:49 Gas prices are controlled by OPEC not obama...
Obama had NOTHING to do with the low gas prices 2 years ago....
OPEC flooded the world with oil causing a glut.
They did this to put businesses OUT of business.
The US had to shelve 500 drilling rigs.
People drove like crazy and used
4022 2018-06-13 16:48:49 Also pay close attention to slavery in north America and what happened to freed slaves and their descendents in both north America and the UK.

Also you need to brush up on American foreign policy, especially when it comes to oil rich countries etc 
4023 2018-06-13 16:48:40 Have you also asked ur Boss to apologize to Nigerians? As at may 29 2015, how many souls have been claimed by Bokoharam,hersdmen,arm robbers, bad road accidents,police brutalities, violence from election malpractices,non payment of sick pensioners, bad water from oil spills?etc
4024 2018-06-13 16:48:39 Found a place to do my oil change for half the price . Today been decent so far
4025 2018-06-13 16:48:37 Wait for the oil wells to dry up.
4026 2018-06-13 16:48:34 Qutar and now America?
Oil rich evil nations buying things they shouldnt be anywhere near!
Makes me sick
4027 2018-06-13 16:48:34 Only episodes I can recall where Zack wasn't trash was the oil episode and when Kelly cheated on him. 

Other than that? Trash.

4029 2018-06-13 16:48:28 Solution?  Rely less on oil. Increase development of and reliance on clean, renewable energy sources. @PressSec
4030 2018-06-13 16:48:27 Love to come in for an oil change with a $15 coupon and they try to upsell me $200. Yeah fuck all the way off @meinekecarcare
4031 2018-06-13 16:48:26 Retweeted Yash Agarwal (@YashAgarwal):

If @PMOIndia @narendramodi / @FinMinIndia @PiyushGoyalOffc remove excess duty on #Solar equipment, higher quality and cost effective infrastructure can help balance dependence on #oil. Indian make solar goods are not good.
4032 2018-06-13 16:48:22 Lmao yea you done scared me now. I’m not ready to stop smoking weed or be responsible.  I’m selfish. I’ll keep using tea tree oil after my showers for now
4033 2018-06-13 16:48:22 •Exfoliate them regularly
•Use lip balm - better with spf in it
•Don’t lick them (IG: @xselfcarebb)
•Massage them with an oil - olive oil, almond oil, jojoba oil, etc
•Always remove lip makeup
•Use lip masks every now and then 
•If you wear lipstick, use moisturising ones
4034 2018-06-13 16:48:21 They will still haul oil and freight first, #paysmore
4035 2018-06-13 16:48:20 but don't American businesses function in the global economy? I mean, I'm a little ol manufacturer but most of my oils for my soap come from overseas..

Let's say we piss Italy off and Italy imposes higher tariffs on olive oil..
4036 2018-06-13 16:48:17 Castor and Coconut oil really saved my hair. Omg.
4037 2018-06-13 16:48:16 Deep State killed the deal and Bush filled the SPR with $120 per barrel oil Carlyle got from Venezuela for $20. Not good.
4038 2018-06-13 16:48:02 High oil prices = direct consequence of Trump blowing up the Iran deal
4039 2018-06-13 16:48:02 Cannot brain lah when a guy topless cooking while the oil starts popping macam tu. Dia takrasa sakit ke?

4041 2018-06-13 16:47:42 No American Gasoline Companies are to blame too. They got what they wanted. Ability to sell outside America & make more $$$ in America. Crude Oil Storage is full & prices are dropping in order for American Oil to get into pipelines.
4042 2018-06-13 16:47:32 Is that oil?
4043 2018-06-13 16:47:27 Interest rates were the main contributor but $140 oil crimped spending by individuals and businesses. Will probably be same contributors next time if oil also reaches level again
4044 2018-06-13 16:47:24 You mean the oil?? Or smoking it?
4045 2018-06-13 16:47:21 Is that from Mintz? I've read it twice and still think it's utter nonesense. It's essentially Regs or do nothing until oil collapses. Which is sorta ignoring the big CC elephant in the room.
4046 2018-06-13 16:47:21 It will not make your skin matt for the whole day but the thing that i like in that mosturizer is it can repair your skin barrier. Other than that i notice the mosturizer could balance my oil's face too thus my face not going to be super oily for the whole day
4047 2018-06-13 16:47:15 OMG! I shouldn’t have to call over a week in advance to @missoulatoyota to get an oil change! Now I have to go to #jiffylube and #lesschwabtires to get everything done. Good thing I’m not shopping for a #newcar... oh wait.

4053 2018-06-13 16:46:57 Did you hear that Maduro!? 
Oil prices are high. Time to get Venezuela  out of the gutter 
4054 2018-06-13 16:46:57 2) full of crap . One because you need coal to make steel , second he also drilling for more oil. Even BBC called Trudeau a hypocrite who not following climate accord . Why are they crying about steel if they are clean ?
4055 2018-06-13 16:46:52 Beautiful I want to rub oil all over you
4056 2018-06-13 16:46:51 And shoring up the dollar with Saudi money. But it's not about peace and that isn't our oil.
4057 2018-06-13 16:46:45 Why would this anger you? Oil paints have many grades of quality. I use the higher grades of paint. For example, one small tube might be $75.00. A lesser quality paint could be $7.00.  Same with canvases. I use the highest quality and wrapped canvases.
4058 2018-06-13 16:46:38 Its a lever that gives you control of oil prices costs nothing out of pocket and gives entrepreneurs like me huge opportunity. It plays to America's stengths.
4059 2018-06-13 16:46:35 Brusius: Mesopotamia was simultaneously the source of material resources such as oil and also artefacts that could be used in the construction of Prussian (and other European) identity
4060 2018-06-13 16:46:35 When Obama was President, you blamed him numerous times for oil and gas prices (which sank to their lowest levels in years on his watch). So will you take responsibility for their rise? Of course not, you are a coward.

4066 2018-06-13 16:46:14 fellas... using hair oil is the best decision you can make
4067 2018-06-13 16:46:11 The ethical nature of our oil does nothing for shielding our economy from brutal recessions every few years. We've got to transition and diversify.

4072 2018-06-13 16:45:43 "Oil smells good"  - that's called poison! 

All seriousness: oils *are* beautiful and versatile. I prefer acrylics, for ease and speed. But digital is quite convenient in a time crunch. I probably go to digital most.
4073 2018-06-13 16:45:38 he's predicting oil at $29 before 2020-21..
4074 2018-06-13 16:45:32 In 1.5 yrs, UG will reach the magic amount of $1000 from  $711 today, I don't need to be pessimistic, I just need to to real and objective. Even if oil was pumped tomorrow,I am 101% confident it's impossible to achieve this mark. There is no way in Ug it could be achieved. Period
4075 2018-06-13 16:45:31 I think we need to make all cars hybrids and then push for all electric. Even making hybrids mandatory would save unimaginable amount of oil. Trucks could still burn diesel until that’s all worked out. I’m not sure if there are hybrid 18wheelers but they would be super $$$

4080 2018-06-13 16:45:11 Stop lying! Your tax scam bill added additional taxes onto the cost of every gallon of gas, and you pulling out of the Iran deal cost us at least a deficit of 500,000 barrels of oil from the market. You are the primary reason oil prices are up! #LiarInChief #DotardDonnie
4081 2018-06-13 16:45:11 No scrubs!  Acid exfoliation is kinder to your skin, I feel. Something with Salycylic acid (BHA) for blackheads, cos it penetrates the oil. Paula's Choice do one.
4082 2018-06-13 16:45:06 This is why there is no such thing as sustainable palm oil.  Companies say it's sustainably havested, but they lie.

4085 2018-06-13 16:44:58 I’ve never tried it but everyone raves! My gf and I live in a small flat with little ventilation so the decision to fry foods is not one that’s made lightly. It leaves oil in the air for days  desperate to try it though!
4086 2018-06-13 16:44:55 Perhaps they felt unappreciated and disrespected by his actions thus they immediately sacked him away. Plus he just extended few days ago, so that adds oil to the fire
4087 2018-06-13 16:44:53 I'd argue the health benefits of eating zero meat, but that another convo. Certainly cattle farms are a huge impact to the environment. A lot of the deforestation in S America is to grow that demand. Palm oil is also a huge environmental impact, and it goes into vegan stuff too.
4088 2018-06-13 16:44:52 Oil production is growing in the U.S. and China exports are increasing, but that's still a small percentage of overall oil production. Try reading before commenting.

Not my feet though..they are really ticklish
4091 2018-06-13 16:44:41 Have we been over my source labeling oil idea before? People pay for organic they won't pay for like civilized regime oil?
4092 2018-06-13 16:44:37 Exactly right!  Why should your president (small ‘p’) care?  He boasts how y’all are a huge oil exporter now.
4093 2018-06-13 16:44:37 You have been sold snake oil. He only operates on behalf of himself and his business interests. Good thing Mueller is investigating all of his crime and corruption.
4094 2018-06-13 16:44:32 DO SOMETHING PLEASE! We don’t depend on OPEC! We have oil! Gouging us at the pump! “Switching to Summer blend” bullshit lie.

4096 2018-06-13 16:44:22 If we don’t sell the oil with Dollar u guys going to be homeless second day. So show some appreciation for Saudis.
4097 2018-06-13 16:44:13 my car has conveniently started dribbling oil everywhere n i can’t get it looked at until i come home in 9 days, fantastic xxx

Oil prices are too high, OPEC is at it again. Not good!

4109 2018-06-13 16:43:16 4) where this might be a more relevant comparison would be for LPG since that is oil majors. But even then, safety rules and other regs make dealership development more complicated and individual purchases are still larger and less frequent

4115 2018-06-13 16:42:40 I put fuel oil because there was a surplus amount
4116 2018-06-13 16:42:40 One could argue the contrary given Scottish oil which is again going up in price.
4117 2018-06-13 16:42:25 Oil is a renewable source of energy, just on a very long time scale...
4118 2018-06-13 16:42:22 It's not about "allies."  It's about protecting US oil interests in the Mideast.

4122 2018-06-13 16:42:04 Can u do oil painting for this pic
4123 2018-06-13 16:42:03 True. It was a bit tongue in cheek. But the goal would essentially be the same as OPEC's, which is to get better prices for oil producers.
4124 2018-06-13 16:42:02 Being Lebanese, from the broken Middle East - yet rich in Oil - I'm target to being outspoken when merely expressing motherland's interests.

We're elevated not in a nice way by simply expressing views. Falstop
Why?
Israel, the Rothchilds - mother of terrorism - is our Neighbors.

4126 2018-06-13 16:41:38 so let's drill in pristine areas so we can extract our own oil and sell it to China
4127 2018-06-13 16:41:35 Ok....well I bet he does like it !!
then I get one of your massages for free 
4128 2018-06-13 16:41:34 As America grows more energy independent, the Middle East countries are seeing their sales drop and will raise prices to make up for losses. All the more reason for us to continue to develop our vast untapped oil deposits. We don’t need the Middle East’s oil.
4129 2018-06-13 16:41:31 America's sole concern in the Mideast is the protection of its oil interests. The 1970s Arab Oil Embargo taught that high prices and long lines at gas pumps can damage the careers of US politicians.

4132 2018-06-13 16:41:21 Quick! Think of some valuable things we can give OPEC nations now, so they can promise to possibly work on lowering oil prices in the future!

4135 2018-06-13 16:41:04 The only reason Norway is richer per head is due to the fact that they have a responsible government that managed their affairs well while the uk did not. They have an oil fund&that is what makes them better off. Scotland could have had that, but the uk mismanaged our resources.

4138 2018-06-13 16:40:54 Another snake oil salesman. He will get his comeuppance but let’s hope it’s not after he and his ilk have completely screwed us with their lies & deceit.
4139 2018-06-13 16:40:49 Oil prices are high. Our allies around the globe are being alienated. Trade wars.  Migrant children being held in cages. American children slaughtered by gun violence. Racism and bigotry on the rise. The world laughs at us.  So. Much. Winning. 
4140 2018-06-13 16:40:45 Tell me what "professional grade canvas and oil paints" are?  This type of thing infuriates me

4145 2018-06-13 16:40:05 They may have had a bone or two thrown at them (more so Cameron than Obama, I sense). But yes, defo neither of them. Had they had a stake worth more than a 1/3 in Soma Oil, we’d have seen more involvement & interest of both in Somalia.
4146 2018-06-13 16:40:01 Wow!  That doesn’t even look like a picture.  It looks like an oil painting.  Beautiful
4147 2018-06-13 16:39:39 #SNPwalkout it’s time Scotland leaves the U.K. so England can’t take the piss out of us by taking our money and oil. England may have ten times the population but not ten times the money, kind of means Scotland is the richer country.
4148 2018-06-13 16:39:38 Smh. & messed up cuticles typically get worse when the oil wears off. I’d keep reapplying oil.
4149 2018-06-13 16:39:35 Our Liar in Chief blames rising oil prices on OPEC. He neglects to mention that the US is a major oil producer and American oil companies continue to screw us. #CowardsAndConmen #TrumpCrimeFamily #oilprices

4155 2018-06-13 16:39:02 Here is some paranoia. It wouldn’t surprise me if Trump somehow managed to up oil prices so that he could complain about it and bring them down and get another political win
4156 2018-06-13 16:38:56 No. Prices originally went up due to OPEC, Canada decided to upgrade refineries (you buy 42% of canadian oil), and Iran was sanctioned!

Iran sells oil. Economist predicted this would occur when the US replaced sanctions.

4172 2018-06-13 16:37:18 This is on you. Iran's oil is off the world market because you sabotaged the Joint Partnership Plan of Action. Less supply, more demand equals higher prices.

4203 2018-06-13 16:35:07 England will struggle if Scotland leaves because then they can’t take our money or oil. England has ten times the population but not ten times the money therefore Scotland is the wealthier country.
4204 2018-06-13 16:35:05 that's precisely the point, key structural reforms was expected from his govt....not the knee jerk reactions on - rise in oil prices/ setting MSP's for farmers....

4216 2018-06-13 16:34:12 President Trump is correct, the cartels control the oil industry.
4217 2018-06-13 16:34:09 Of course oil prices are going up again.  It was an altogether predictable response to your reneging on the Iran nuclear deal (a real, verifiable denuclearization, unlike your political theater with Kim).  "Not good" indeed, Spanky!!!
4218 2018-06-13 16:34:05 Mac taupe + klarins lip oil. Forever
4219 2018-06-13 16:33:46 Some of us pray for a chocolate cake BUT when God provides the eggs, milk, oil, sugar flour,  bowl, spoon and an oven. Frustration sets in and we leave the kitchen.  Let that sink in... #Wisdom
4220 2018-06-13 16:33:41 My man’s mom told me to stay away from canola oil. And here I am frying things in canola oil of course.
4221 2018-06-13 16:33:39 You didn’t end anything you snake oil salesman. If you had served in the armed forces instead of being a 5-time deferment yellow bellied coward...you might understand the complexity of this. Complexity mean it’s hard to explain in pictures. #dumbestPresidentEver
4222 2018-06-13 16:33:35 Oil prices are high because you started up with Iran, Mexico and  Venezuela. Your tweets/rants have consequences and the American people are paying for it.
4223 2018-06-13 16:33:32 ลอเล่งงง 
4224 2018-06-13 16:33:18 Why? Because I don't love my oily face enough I have to change it? Nah! I don't wanna be dry like your Afro  or you need some of my oil for it?
4225 2018-06-13 16:33:14 Cut Down our need for oil - prices will then drop
4226 2018-06-13 16:33:00 Probably due to interest rates, not oil.
4227 2018-06-13 16:33:00 @shecanncannabis DYK I stumped an LP yesterday because I asked the difference between "actual" & "potential" in the percentage of THC oil. There really is a difference!
4228 2018-06-13 16:32:53 Taaaar,metchonu.
Ok i understand 'no gf' but you have the ones that you oil their engines from time to time,doki doki
4229 2018-06-13 16:32:45 Will OPEC pumping more oil help the US get cheaper gasoline in summer? The US is already flooded with domestic production. Lowering the oil price will just hurt Shale producers. Trump is knifing himself in the knee. #OPEC #OOTT

4240 2018-06-13 16:32:01 By next week or so, ima need an oil change.
4241 2018-06-13 16:31:57 How ill informed. This nation is in debt to nearly the tune of 2 Trillion! Forget the myth about 5th richest country-we only have the 5th highest 'turnover' and like all global economies-there isn't any profit!! That goes to the Tech, Oil, Corporate, financial, drugs Co's etc.
4242 2018-06-13 16:31:48 @zarkadakis Some case studies from the realm of work: from oil rig worker to data dashboard analyst, from bank teller to digital factory product owner, from commuting 3hrs/day to working from home #futureofwork #AISummit
4243 2018-06-13 16:31:41 Your simplistic mind is too small to realize that rising oil prices are a combo of higher demand currently, you fucking the Iran deal, and the drop in the value of the dollar. You have experts around you that could teach you this but you are too stupid to accept advice!
4244 2018-06-13 16:31:30 All travelers must comply with federal law on transporting marijuana and cannabis infused products, such as CBD oil, on board a flight. Our officers are required to notify law enforcement officers if they discover these products while screening your property.
4245 2018-06-13 16:31:27 People have used CBD Oil to reduce stress and depression or anxiety. Due to legalities we can’t say it works but if you do some research there’s plenty of free information 
4246 2018-06-13 16:31:26 I think for my dried anaheim pepper I'll let it sit in olive oil in a little container for a week or so and then use it as a marinade? Idk!!!!

4249 2018-06-13 16:31:23 Yeah it was , cus too much fuel oil was available than was needed so it can be better used else where
4250 2018-06-13 16:31:18 Lol that under table oil money
4251 2018-06-13 16:31:18 If we are exporting oil that means we are independent right? Then why are we using opecs prices?
4252 2018-06-13 16:31:17 Oil prices are fine, USA is making good money and jobs producing and gas prices are ok unless you live highly taxed liberal jurisdictions.
4253 2018-06-13 16:30:57 And as a species breeding at the rate we are these things aren't already under threat? I guess if we cut gas & oil mining many won't be able to afford to heat their homes in the winter & would die. That'll free up homes, the NHS & reduce much demand.

4256 2018-06-13 16:30:45 Everything Trump does on the world stage is to the benefit of Russia:
- withdraws from TPP
- undermines NATO alliance
- undermines G7, trade war
- ends Iran deal, oil prices up
- suggests withdrawal from SK
What else?

4258 2018-06-13 16:30:33 I know how about we use our own oil instead of selling it !  MAGA
4259 2018-06-13 16:30:32 Did you know that you can coconut oil on your weaves and wigs? It leaves them shiny and last longer. I use it on my braided wig and no issues. Try it #coconuts #wigs #braids #humanhair #nutzone

4262 2018-06-13 16:29:52 Really that just applies to pizza.
4263 2018-06-13 16:29:49 S/O to jojoba hot oil treatment because my hair hasn’t felt this good in awhile.
4264 2018-06-13 16:29:36 Your mouth is way too dirty for a dumb bird! I'm going to fry you in oil! When your real owner comes to get you I'm going to kill them!
4265 2018-06-13 16:29:33 Trump retweeted again. ...Oil is too high. OPEC is at it again... This is more than asking. It is an order. How humiliating for OPEC.
4266 2018-06-13 16:29:26 PT: Ministry of Oil highlighted latest development of the Bahrain natural gas importation station project, as part of the energy security strategy. The project is expected to be ready in the first quarter of next year
4267 2018-06-13 16:29:18 It's a slim chance I'll fall, olive oil.
4268 2018-06-13 16:29:15 Yes,if you want a snake oil salesman as your President.Everything is a shell game with this vile liar and your inability to be an effective counter balance to his con will precipitate your undoing. And, for this Florida voter, your decline, and his, cannot happen soon enough!
4269 2018-06-13 16:29:06 Actually gutted that fractional distillation of crude oil was only tick boxes  I learned that model answer so well 
4270 2018-06-13 16:29:03 PT: HE Minister of Oil applauded the efficiency of the civil defence in dealing with previous cases, including the fire in the oil pipeline in Buri and the fire in the refinery. The high performance of civil defence teams minimise losses
4271 2018-06-13 16:29:00 "Carbon Engineering’s fuel costs about 25 per cent more than gasoline made from oil. ...And if it ran on wind- or solar-generated electricity [it evidently presently uses natural gas heating], the fuel would be almost carbon neutral."
This will be the key to uptake of the process

4273 2018-06-13 16:28:38 Cultivating one million hectares of oil palm in the next five years will definitely see Edo State climb in the Oil Palm production chain

4279 2018-06-13 16:27:50 Please elaborate. Did you add coconut oil to your coffee? Or did you drink coconut-flavored coffee?
4280 2018-06-13 16:27:48 Can I put oil all over you
4281 2018-06-13 16:27:42 Truly. That's like the middle, where all the farms and oil rig things are
4282 2018-06-13 16:27:26 True until there is no oil.  Tech valuations won’t mean shit if we can’t power the tech.

4318 2018-06-13 16:24:07 Mr President please untie US oil away from OPEC to keep our oil becoming so inflated. It's insane to have our citizens pay high oil prices because Saudia Arabia wants to raise its rates

4340 2018-06-13 16:21:15 Yes but not to so great an extent; Mexico does not have an economy reliant solely on one export like Venezuela (crude oil makes up 85% of their entire economy.)

Nonetheless expect a recession there as centralization slowly reduces output.

4344 2018-06-13 16:20:46 That’s a Nigerian thing, it doesn’t make sense but that is talk for another day. Either way, Oil prices go up because there is demand for oil. That in turn increases demand for Naira, which in turn drops exchange rate. Like I said ‘... good fo oil producing states’.

4356 2018-06-13 16:20:12 Omega 3 is a fatty acid. There's three types alpha-linolenic found in plant oil, eicosapentaenoic found in fish oil, and docosahexaenoic which is also found in fish oil.

4358 2018-06-13 16:20:03 Excellent article. Need ur option on IF Lucic goes, could the oil be interested in Mike Green? Right shot Vet with scoring history, could be had for less than his prior 6M hit.
4359 2018-06-13 16:19:55 hey OPEC
Oil prices are too high

4360 2018-06-13 16:19:55 Oil prices too high - Are you just figuring that out now? @realDonaldTrump is an imbecile.

4367 2018-06-13 16:19:33 Why if oil is being pumped out of the ground in record numbers in our own country is this allowed to happen ?
4368 2018-06-13 16:19:31 I honestly don't get this essential oil craze, I know two people completely caught up in EO pyramid schemes. Of course Oz would be promoting such a "cure".

4379 2018-06-13 16:19:01 The US gets a bit over 40% of it’s oil imports from Canada. Trump owes Saudi Arabia a lot of money and has hotels and golf resorts all over the UAE. Provoking a trade war with Canada could mean oil tariffs which would give the Saudis a lot more profits.

4384 2018-06-13 16:18:31 I didn’t like the signing - I was never a fan of Lucic and his game.  Always thought he was over-rated.
4385 2018-06-13 16:18:27 On top of everything he is doing for peace, @POTUS is still the guardian of ALL American people pushing back at OPEC for high oil prices. Wonder how they will twist this one trying to make him look evil... Wont work!!!
 MY/YOUR PRESIDENT!!
4386 2018-06-13 16:18:22 That actually doesn't sound completely awful to me? Dumping the chevre in seems like a bit of a waste and I personally prefer to actually roast or grill the tomatoes instead of cooking them in a vat of oil though.
4387 2018-06-13 16:18:17 I’m fairly certain that waiting for your oil to be changed at a car dealership will be what hell is like, only your car never gets finished.
4388 2018-06-13 16:18:17 Found a local shop that sells reasonably cheap oil paint mediums FINALLY
4389 2018-06-13 16:18:15 I also use overnight straight up coconut oil. Along side Palmers coconut oil shampoo and conditioner and some oil spray reconstructor stuff. I smell like a bounty bar!

4392 2018-06-13 16:17:59 Spent month in repairing one machine because pump bearing became salt in oil
4393 2018-06-13 16:17:39 Angie, listen to me. @sky_beards will greatly benefit from you and your husband's association in it's commercials. Anyone knows that denim-wearing, country music-listening Christians will always have an opportunity to make it in the Beard oil poster model business. Please respond
4394 2018-06-13 16:17:36 Maybe there is oil on that property. What about mineral rights?
4395 2018-06-13 16:17:33 I have a gift card for amazon and guess what I’m buying... an essential oil diffuser and essential oils. I am officially a 40 year old mom.
4396 2018-06-13 16:17:31 How does that sugar, cooking oil, contraband and fake products get into our shops around the country? Honestly, it means that it has been there for ages only that someone turned a blind eye and deaf ear.
4397 2018-06-13 16:17:23 or maybe it is because you put sanctions on two of the biggest oil producer...
4398 2018-06-13 16:17:21 Make organised crime great again. Bribery is the oil that greases the gears of local government, it will be the key to urban improvement!

4403 2018-06-13 16:17:04 Except the problem with that also is that we the citizens of an oil producing state still purchasing our own product at high prices. I hate buying fuel more expensive that people we sell to.but Trump gets it

4411 2018-06-13 16:16:26 Once again Putin’s puppet does his master’s bidding. Driving up the price of oil increases the revenue flow to Putin. Trump sucks! And he is a BLATANT FRAUD!

- kids being separated from their parents seeking asylum here
- indigenous people losing their lands to your oil friends

4436 2018-06-13 16:15:11 On this date in 1994 a jury in Alaska found Exxon liable in the Exxon Valdex oil spill.  Exxon's $5 billion penalty was financed, in part, through the issuance of the very first Credit Default Swap. The CDS market would explode and 13 years later our housing market would implode.

4450 2018-06-13 16:14:22 It is your best buddies over in Saudi Arabia leading OPEC that is curbing production to raise oil prices.  Maybe you should use your fantastic , best ever, personal relationship and give them a call.

No one had an issue w/ the move, the problem was term & essentially bringing him in as Hall's replacement. Those are two very different things.

4498 2018-06-13 16:10:26 Really wish acrylic paint would have the same consistency and method as oil because I’m so tired of paying $100 on two tubes of paint because I fundamentally can’t understand how to work with acrylic.
4499 2018-06-13 16:10:21 I have used Turmeric to great benefit.
In combination with Black pepper and coconut oil has cured sore throats

All people in India vouch for this magic herb.And this is gospel.

4509 2018-06-13 16:09:37 Love Indy. Actually headed there today. Was one of first cuts along with Cleveland and Pittsburgh. Not sure if city wanted it or that Lucas Oil isn’t set up well for grass/soccer. Also lacks a strong soccer culture needed if it would host a non-US game.
4510 2018-06-13 16:09:34 No it doesn't.  Loads of other things. But popular consensus amongst the medical community is Mustard oil.the best oil for Indians..

4512 2018-06-13 16:09:24 They're both morally bankrupt. Trudeau sells weapons to Saudi Arabia just like Trudeau. They both want to ram through oil pipelines against First Nations/Native America rights.

4516 2018-06-13 16:09:12 Welcome to the new @EPA we are a brand new lobbying firm for Coal, Oil, Natural Gas, and Chemical corporations.  We don't discriminate as long as you have a checkbook, and don't mind doing personal "favors" occasionally, we will get rid of those pesky regulations bothering you

4518 2018-06-13 16:08:59 boy used too much coconut oil and that's facts
4519 2018-06-13 16:08:50 When Trump appointed a #coal & oil #shill to the #EPA, it's obvious he didn't want a #competent person in charge. There's nothing about #ScottPruitt's appointment that's good for the American people. Speaking of #picking winners & losers, Trump picked US to #lose, & business win.
4520 2018-06-13 16:08:47 They've been trying to keep the price of oil low to fuck over US shale oil production. 

Prices on the rise is actually a... good thing for America?

4523 2018-06-13 16:08:27 Also, I’d like to see what the projections are for US oil reserves now that we are tapping them so aggressively. It’s not like the US wanted to be subject to embargos at OPEC’s whims. Also, there were few environmental regulations in the ‘70s. Nothing comes for free.

4528 2018-06-13 16:08:12 Still wondering why a lot of people use baby oil as lubricant instead of the lubricant gel itself 
4529 2018-06-13 16:08:10 You can go to Jiffy Lube 500 miles after an oil change and they gonna recommend oil, filter, transmission, wiper fluid, brakes, and a car tree scent
4530 2018-06-13 16:08:03 Herbst says Boughton’s plan to eliminate state income tax is unrealistic right now. Says other states without it either have very high sales tax (which lawmakers have balked at here) or have a natural resource (like oil) they can tax
4531 2018-06-13 16:07:44 I don't think I've ever read something more in accurate in my life. 1. Oil prices are not dictated by the value of the dollar, 2. Saudi Arabia just pledged to increase oil production.

4535 2018-06-13 16:07:29 WE, the USA, don't need their oil, Europe does!  US refineries need to retool so they can run Light Oil from fracking vs Sour from importers so we can use more of our own oil. Gas Tax and fees in Calif. is 72cents per gal. Thats the problem!

4555 2018-06-13 16:05:46 I would like to order 1 case of snake oil please.
4556 2018-06-13 16:05:38 I'd eat that. Great... Now I want an actual chicken McGriddle.
4557 2018-06-13 16:05:29 I used to use apple cider vinegar two or three times a week to really clean my skin and it worked really well before my hormones played a factor. Also, tea tree oil is amazing for spot treatments!
4558 2018-06-13 16:05:25 Hey, @jamesob, let me know what exactly it is you want from @jeremycorbyn to get your vote of confidence. Is it something like Crobyn's #PMQs here, or do you stil prefer a War Criminal who lied and fabricated evidence to enter into an ILLEGAL War over the price of OIL?

4567 2018-06-13 16:04:52 I put fuel oil cos why would u crack petrol if it was already useful

4569 2018-06-13 16:04:51 They have tar sands oil, which is almost as destructive.
4570 2018-06-13 16:04:44 Too bad. It really needs geo-thermal energy in a big way. That not only gives us cheap energy, but puts oil/gas drillers to work on clean energy instead.
4571 2018-06-13 16:04:42 Obama didn't have high oil????

4573 2018-06-13 16:04:34 They have!! Maybe it's time for Americans to pay their fair share and stop expecting preferential treatment! Americans get the majority of their oil from Canada at a cheaper price than Canadians get their own oil!! Maybe it's time for them to raise the price or close the taps!
4574 2018-06-13 16:04:15 Now I can’t get a fuckin oil change.
4575 2018-06-13 16:04:15 This tweet insults even your followers intelligence. You knew from the start the Tarrifs would cause a Tarriffs war, increasing cost for goods & transportation thus oil. It is insulting to tweet No Good OPEC. Many of your rich friends are getting rich @ our inconvienace.$$$$$$
4576 2018-06-13 16:04:09 What's Trump's next big move? Maybe he should put tariffs on oil and electricity from Canada too - or maybe Justin should put a border tax on them, to help pay for losses in Canadian steel.
4577 2018-06-13 16:04:04 Drill here in USA... we need our own resources!!! American OIL/natural gas... SIMPLE
4578 2018-06-13 16:03:56 In the meantime. Try the @tartecosmetics timeless smoothing primer. Warm it up in your fingers and press it into the pores, I never get oil and wear my makeup for 12+ hours most days. I didn’t use it one day and could wipe my makeup off with a tissue.
4579 2018-06-13 16:03:56 Hahaha same! I didnt get my oil changed till the other day since last year 
4580 2018-06-13 16:03:53 Complicated issue, as Middle East always has been. Where does our ‘trade’ with SA end? Easy answer is not to sell arms. Do we then stop buying oil, trading, banking, tech, etc etc. The world is not black & white. You support others in the region who are equally ruthless
4581 2018-06-13 16:03:47 I’m sure that can’t be right? The province of B.C. says oil will be pretty much dead by then. 
4582 2018-06-13 16:03:47 in the new normal, snake oil techie elon boasts about being a failure as badge of honor and reason to pour moar $$$ into exploding e-shitmobiles.
4583 2018-06-13 16:03:45 This is a republican tradition. Cut taxes and give the extra money to the oil/gas company . When it hits $5 gallon then the anointed president becomes a bum. Ask W.
4584 2018-06-13 16:03:44 Mr. President, oil prices are just fine. $66.50 isn't a big deal. I'd say it's healthy even. We get to the high $80's and beyond, we'll talk. #Oil #Investing
4585 2018-06-13 16:03:38 Yes. Palm oil farming has eradicated so much of the forests in Sumatra, Indonesia. Sickening!!!!
4586 2018-06-13 16:03:38 I walked into Firestone for an oil change at 8 AM and am still waiting  and it is currently 11:04......AN OIL CHANGE
4587 2018-06-13 16:03:37 I thought it was code for Canada to tariff the 41% of US oil imports it sends across the border 
4588 2018-06-13 16:03:32 Me Also, but I do understand that faced with our economy [ it is improving ] people are scared they will be replaced. I live in oil country & we have been hammered here, companies moving abroad due to lack of drilling & exploration have really hurt.
4589 2018-06-13 16:03:29 Best hot take I’ve seen today on FIFA’s decision to award the 2026 World Cup...is that again they’ve awarded the Cup to a host country that is a heavy Oil Producer, with an evil dictator, and a spotty record in human rights...

4592 2018-06-13 16:03:23 While I agree it should not be illegal to use cannabis oil for medical reasons,  this isn't enough to ask. There is no reason for cannabis to be illegal.  There is already a petition asking to legalise cannabis.

4594 2018-06-13 16:03:20 And Mustard oil  has been used for centuries if we are going there
4595 2018-06-13 16:03:17 Interesting how oil prices dropped under Clinton and Obama, and they rose under Reagan, Bush 1, Bush 2, and you.
I wonder if there's a pattern somewhere...
4596 2018-06-13 16:03:16 Oil from not you country
4597 2018-06-13 16:03:15 Gotcha on this one, I remember when gas was .26 cents a gallon and heating oil was .19 cents a gallon.  Geez, I really gave away my age on this one!  Those were the days!  Soda or Pop was .05 cents a bottle and cigarettes were .35 cents a pack.
4598 2018-06-13 16:03:15 Under the Clinton 1994 deal, North Korea was to be provided with $4 billion in energy aid for heavy oil shipments and two light-water nuclear reactors. In exchange, North Korea agreed to freeze and dismantle its nuclear weapons program.
And nothing still happen!
4599 2018-06-13 16:03:01 What ? Your response is babble ..noome ever said blood spilled in north korea  after 53..your previous presidents went to war in iraq for no just reason other than to secure oil...catch up willis

4605 2018-06-13 16:02:18 TI gives Canada top marks for low corruption.

4618 2018-06-13 16:01:15 I'm confused, are you implying that USD and inflation expectations are not significant factors in near/medium term commod future prices? Especially oil?
4619 2018-06-13 16:01:14 if we don't stop pumping co2 and methane into the atmosphere, and that includes things like beef production as well as coal and oil, there won't be any people around to use the grid in 200 years.

Could I use it only before night?

4634 2018-06-13 16:00:05 Nope. Oil prices are 100% on you. Destroy a deal with Iran that was working, and oil prices go up. Too bad you appear unwilling to think through the consequences of your actions.

4637 2018-06-13 15:59:56 For crying out loud!  When are you #GOP people going to understand that destroying our air, water, land, health is not worth all the $$ you get from your oil/gas donors?!  MOVE ON to sustainable energy!  @NRDems

4641 2018-06-13 15:59:21 The challenge these days is to ensure that the solution is not equally/almost as damaging as the problem (palm oil). Need to reduce demand, & not destroy forests etc. to create land space for replacement products.

4646 2018-06-13 15:58:41 had the lwb van one with a perkins.. very good mpg.. I sold it while it was still running.. these used to get hairline cracks in the head running between the valve ports, was a common problem.. as it got worse it caused difficulty in cold starts and oil seepage into the cylinders
4647 2018-06-13 15:58:31 That's the magic question... but you're skipping a step. It's not what the Fed does exactly, more about what the fx/rates market expects to happen and how the USD is traded afterwards. For example: if USD spikes, expect oil to trade lower.
4648 2018-06-13 15:58:30 We are still dependant on oil and gas! I’d like to be employed till I’m retired at 50!
4649 2018-06-13 15:58:28 The price of oil went up after Trump pulled out of the Iran deal. Not Obama's fault. Food prices, airline prices etc all going up because of gas prices. By dismantling the mandate to have insurance, Trump caused the prices to spike. Always bringing up Obama....sad just sad.

4651 2018-06-13 15:58:07 Really, they’re saying his tariffs alone will cost US 140,000 jobs. And you get almost half of steel and aluminum from Canada, almost half gas and oil, and hydroelectricity. Perhaps you’ve heard of TPP trade agreement that US dropped out of which is tabled in  parliament.

4658 2018-06-13 15:57:27 All fats are essential for body. But in a proper amount. The problem with fast food is they want solid fat for processing which is saturated fat. Main source is coconut which is expensive. That's why they do hydrogenation of cheap pufa oil like soya n rapeseed.
4659 2018-06-13 15:57:26 Part of every $ spent on crude oil/gas comes back as terrorist funding and we raise terrorism issue as priority one on all international forums . Why this contradiction and spending billions of $ on refineries when we should get out of oil economy

4661 2018-06-13 15:57:19 Maybe a dumb question, but how much, if any, of a role did planned gas/oil pipelines running through Georgia/Abkhazia/Ossetia have to do with the Russian invasion in 2008?

4665 2018-06-13 15:56:55 I thought we were oil self sufficient. If so what does OPEC have to do with it unless American companies now follow thei lead?
4666 2018-06-13 15:56:50 @RockFM_ES  Considerar a Midnight Oil un one hit wonder es un poco atrevido ¿no?   Por lo menos, aquí en Valencia, también sonó The Dead Heart ... Sería un two hit wonder 
4667 2018-06-13 15:56:49 I did not, hence why I'm begging for RTs on a sizzle reel so I can get my oil changed.
4668 2018-06-13 15:56:48 It is definitely the case that very high growth in the second half of last year pushed the economy above its sustainable capacity, lifting inflation. In addition, depreciation and oil prices are also adding to inflation

4694 2018-06-13 15:55:08 That's the reason we are becoming less dependent on foreign oil. 10 years ago it was at 60% and its down to 20% now and lowering. A few more years and maybe exporting. OPEC is not liking that.
4695 2018-06-13 15:55:01 I believe one day, we will become self sufficient when it comes to oil.. May even become a exporter.
4696 2018-06-13 15:55:00 make sure the grates are clean and get the grill as hot as possible.  A little oil on the meat or grill will also help it from sticking and give you better marks.  When you turn it to get the cross hatch use a new section of the grill.

4704 2018-06-13 15:54:03 There are but a couple countries on our foe list that rely heavily on Iran oil and there's possibility that one day we will go to war with one or the other. Canada will be drawn into the conflict in one way or the other and so siding with us wrt Iran is a strategic move.

4769 2018-06-13 15:49:54 The price of oil is due to you and your Iran policy.
4770 2018-06-13 15:49:44 หน่วงรูม39
4771 2018-06-13 15:49:36 The Saudis and OPEC are in partnership with Putin now and Putin has nuclear weapons. Why should they lower oil prices. Does Trump ever lower the price of American goods?
4772 2018-06-13 15:49:29 If u are able bodied and arent a convicted felon, there are tons of oil jobs in Texas (Midland, Odessa, San Antonio) and Louisiana. They require no experience, 15 days on, 7 days off, live in an extended stay hotel, $20-30 daily per diem pay, $9000/month for new hires, benefits.
4773 2018-06-13 15:49:26 1985, 1992, 1994, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2016. And 2018. 

Those are all the years North Korea said they would not pursue nukes or would denuclearize.

You were sniffing gun oil during that time evidently.
4774 2018-06-13 15:49:25 Are you talking about @theSNP whose members refuse to sign EDM 1239 and are leaving 000's of doctors, nurses, oil workers, ... go bankrupted with the #2019LoanCharge introduced by the Tories?

4776 2018-06-13 15:49:22 This is our chance. The future of the Arctic Refuge is about to be decided. Join me and @TheWCS to say "Absolutely no drilling for oil and gas in the Arctic Refuge" http://1/#.WyE892-1kYY.twitter

4780 2018-06-13 15:49:10 I smell like a walking coconut. Coconut oil is my favourite 
4781 2018-06-13 15:49:10 石油だってオリーブオイルだって牛脂だって仲間さ、そうだろう?
4782 2018-06-13 15:49:04 nah they gotta oil it so other people can use it as a mirror

4786 2018-06-13 15:49:00 This is hard to believe, lets hope the US don’t find oil in the stadium because they will take over...
4787 2018-06-13 15:48:57 Don’t know what the score is where you’re going, but dealerships here will store your tires during whatever season, then put them on for you when you do your spring/winter oil changes.
4788 2018-06-13 15:48:52 That's entirely untrue I was using CBD oil purchased at my local health food store and I tested positive on marijuana on my drug screen. The brand name was creating Better Days! Fortunately for me my pain doctors pro-marijuana and said for me to stop.
4789 2018-06-13 15:48:51 Don’t tell Russia that oil is too high. They need the money.
4790 2018-06-13 15:48:41 Before IFMIS, am a concerned Kenyan who needs to know why our crude oil should be refined outside Kenya. Yet when I was studying GHC years back I heard of something like Changamwe Oil Refinery. We in 2018 with Oil but no Refinery? We need governance for the people.

4792 2018-06-13 15:48:38 Where is the promise of American oil companies to increase oil production in the US to a record level? For our shale companies, such a price is unacceptable!
4793 2018-06-13 15:48:38 Because of you #dipshit and rolling back all of @BarackObama energy plans. You are to blame for this oil hike and I’m sure if someone dug enoygh they would show you with oil holdings
4794 2018-06-13 15:48:38 I pat dry since I put baby oil on after a shower^^

4802 2018-06-13 15:47:59 Efficiency is always their top priority. They do math. If the economy relies on large central power plants they can shift to #fusion or some more robust #fission (if its materials issues get solved). Meanwhile wipe out oil furnace, fossil vehicles, inefficient lighting & devices.
4803 2018-06-13 15:47:55 Oil futures historic crash now below 10 dollars and lower
4804 2018-06-13 15:47:55 I don't expect an open conflict  this close to #Libya's #oil crescent to be allowed by international players tbh...
But if a conflict does happen in #Sirte, #Misrata is incentivized to fight IN Sirte against the #LNA, just because of the sheer direct threat that is to their city.
4805 2018-06-13 15:47:52 Actually if you wash it a lot the oil do nothing for it just doesn't let it breath between two washes if you wanna out oil put il before you wash yoir hair for like 1h or 2h then wash it also try to wash your hair 3 times a weak or like 1day yes 1day no or you'll actually dry it

Mending oplas aja, mbak.
4813 2018-06-13 15:47:07 Renewables are here and cheaper than fossil fuels. Glad to hear how desperate the oil cos are who have wrecked the planet. Now they should pay to fix it.

4815 2018-06-13 15:46:58 Hi, we produce a gorgeous chilli oil, based in North London and would like more information on the chilli fiesta, if it’s still happening. 

Can you email me joe@sunwahfoods.co.uk thank you
4816 2018-06-13 15:46:55 Chef Louis cut up some acne, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was veal, along with sushi.
4817 2018-06-13 15:46:52 I agree. I've been trying out avocado oil. I also feel like coconut is actually too heavy for my curly hair & weighs my curls down.

4819 2018-06-13 15:46:36 Republicans gave oil biz massive tax cuts (they are rewarding shareholders) & ignorantly meddled w the Iran Deal. You don't get to act surprised when you caused gas prices to increase 21%+ the past yr. Americans are expected to pay an extra $38B in 2018 thanks to GOP. #MAGA
4820 2018-06-13 15:46:34 FOMC has nothing to do with oil prices.
4821 2018-06-13 15:46:33 Fossil Fuels. That is the fuel that has driven our progress. Discovering, understanding & converting not only the energy stored but manipulating the molecular structure to make materials is what has been driving our “progress”. If it weren’t for oil, we would still be in 19th C.
4822 2018-06-13 15:46:19 Hi Sarah-Jane,
Loving that you love Palmer’s! We're sorry to hear about your experience with our Natural Bronze. Please could you email us at customerservice@etbrowne.co.uk and let us know if you used the Cocoa Butter or the Coconut Oil version? Best wishes x
4823 2018-06-13 15:46:10 Oh, you finally noticed that oil prices and the corresponding gas prices were too high.  Way to be on top of things!
4824 2018-06-13 15:46:08 なるほど...Oil Justice...
4825 2018-06-13 15:46:06 I ditched years ago: toothpaste, shampoo, soap, cleanings soaps, except the soft green one, I ditched olive oil and other plant-oils and margarines, except coconut oil.

4832 2018-06-13 15:45:32 Exxon and oil companies have no want to lower price, they control supply in USA, not  trump
4833 2018-06-13 15:45:23 Ww2? Everything would be at stake. So if it were up to you we would just sit by and watch SK be invaded and taken over because they don’t have oil? Right we would be fighting across the pacific with our 12 aircraft carriers compared to their like 3 (not real numbers idk exactly).
4834 2018-06-13 15:45:22 Super cute racer girl...

Can you check my oil please...yes - the dipstick is right there! 
4835 2018-06-13 15:45:22 Give tax break to Shale Oil. It will boost US oil exports and reduce the price.
4836 2018-06-13 15:45:18 Gotta say Kenny is right Woods is like that snake oil salesman from back in the day willing to slap his name on any old merch or new fade game that’s just come out... #XavierWoodsSuperBombermanR maybe he should get some pointers from @NickJacksonYB & @MattJackson13 about Merch
4837 2018-06-13 15:45:15 Chuck several months ago President Trump spoke about OPEC and their actions to raise the price of Oil.
4838 2018-06-13 15:45:14 He thinks he's something special. He's a greedy criminal, unwilling to do his job! His job is to keep our food, water & climate safe. Instead, he works with coal, oil and lets cereals and processed food
 put RoundUp (Glyphosate) in our
food. Monsanto poisons get a pass!

4841 2018-06-13 15:45:08 World waking up to climate change n destructive power of oil n gas industries. Does that mean i no longer a hippy? Will i bee off the 'domestic extremist' list for campaigning for clean water n air for all? Doubt it
4842 2018-06-13 15:45:03 Absolutely @realDonaldTrump, something needs to be done in order to tackle the manipulation and speculation around the oil price and bring it down. OPEC is ta it, again. Absolutely.

4844 2018-06-13 15:44:52 I found that peculiar too,which makes me think the lines were put in and some owners didn't convert furnaces from heating oil. Adverts now would make sense as oil price up. Couldn't find data save average household fuel oil spend of ~$150, suggesting a fair number of households.

4851 2018-06-13 15:44:15 Oil prices?  Gas prices have been ours control for how long?
4852 2018-06-13 15:44:04 You’re stretching! Literally don’t let your lotion/oil dry at all, just keep it slathered on at all times
4853 2018-06-13 15:44:00 Ridley Scott tried to make Gladiator (2000) an authentic representation of Ancient Rome. An early script had Maximus doing a product endorsement for olive oil, which was historically accurate, but the detail was left out in later scripts for being too unbelievable.
4854 2018-06-13 15:43:56 Time to send them a message,including Domestic BIG OIL now! Pump prices go up for every reason imaginable; storms, treat of storms, wars, using too much, not using enough, cold winter & Never come down, over $3.25 p/gal reg only hurts the low income & middle class. Price Gouging!

4857 2018-06-13 15:43:51 Any state by state analysis on reduction of carbon? I assume it’s more pronounced in places like the Northwest with hydropower than a place where they rely on gas or oil fired plants. Any state where owning an EV is negative in terms of carbon savings?
4858 2018-06-13 15:43:47 Kick butt!!! 
4859 2018-06-13 15:43:46 If you hadn't let the deal with Iran expire, oil prices wouldn't be so high right now.
4860 2018-06-13 15:43:43 The former.  That's oil already sold.  It will be replaced.  Additional production simply locks in opportunity cost on each new bbl.

4865 2018-06-13 15:43:10 Hard stances? Depends on your definition of hard stances.  I just want the Conservatives to stand up and call out idiotic policies that use gender and climate changes as their basis. I want them to stand for the oil industry as they do for auto ind. and SM.
4866 2018-06-13 15:43:07 so yesterday this trucks engine like exploded on the highway, of course I was behind it also, oil flew all over my windshield and hood so my stupid ass puts on my windshield wipers thinking it was water and smeared it all over my windsheild, almost crashed and drove off the road

4873 2018-06-13 15:42:34 These oil prices are a direct result of your policies.
4874 2018-06-13 15:42:32 Perhaps but they’re fighting next door and we’re fighting across the Pacific and I’d rather not engage Russia and China in war and also we don’t stand up to bullies and dictators unless our oil, our election fixing, our colonizing, or our financial success is at stake

4887 2018-06-13 15:41:43 The issue with that is that you can’t regulate oil companies south of the border, so any moves that are made here will simply disadvantage our industry here, more so than they already are with the carbon tax
4888 2018-06-13 15:41:36 Unstable leadership is what makes oil high. So time for Mueller to get some stability back in America.

4890 2018-06-13 15:41:31 Good for US oil
4891 2018-06-13 15:41:30 We have to be careful these days not to be too hasty in bashing oil prices. My cousins in North Dakota are loving improved pricing and have made America a net petroleum exporter. WE should also be in OPEC a the worlds leader in energy exports.

4895 2018-06-13 15:41:19 Prime Minister of India visiting other countries is welcome. But on the other hand increasing oil prices every other day, resulting in sky rocketing of prices of essential commodities is bothersome.

4912 2018-06-13 15:40:04 I'm not a dietician. But the debate reminds me of the old butter vs marg debate in the 1970s. Margarine was a byproduct of the oil industry but marketed as healthier. Use common sense & eat a mixed varied unprocessed diet.
4913 2018-06-13 15:40:03 Yes you can get them all from an asia market and it wasnt that expensive there. the ingrediants are enough to make the oil a few times as well :)

Nafta obliges Canada not only to export most of its oil and half its natural gas to the US, but also to ensure that the proportion of these fuels produced from tar sands and fracking does not change.

4981 2018-06-13 15:34:45 He couldn’t, NK never had any relationship with the US which allowed them to bank payments for their oil sales in US banks which was seized by the US when that relationship broke like Iran did. That was all Iran’s money, not ours. We had stole it, so we had to return it.

5045 2018-06-13 15:28:42 It's your fault that's why the oil prices have gone up. Remember what you did with Iran. You don't care about us the people of America.
5046 2018-06-13 15:28:35 You stay in Dubai so I guess u knows better how Arabs treat outsiders in their country...they r getting the money only by selling oil...they bring ppl from around the world to do their dirty jobs and treat them worst
5047 2018-06-13 15:28:34 We should attack opec and seize their oil. Then invade Canada and seize theirs as well.
5048 2018-06-13 15:28:31 Every summer they raise the gas prices. Every winter they raise the fuel oil. When are we going to be self sufficient oil producers to not rely on OPEC? Start drilling!
5049 2018-06-13 15:28:31 Oil. Isn't this is your motive ? You and Putin's. That's the reason for Scott Pruitt's deregulation. The sooner the ice melts, the sooner you can drill. And opening up our State parks and Conservation lands for oil drilling. Admit dump. It's about lining the pockets of the ilk.

5070 2018-06-13 15:26:33 However after trump took over he made historic cuts to regulations on the fossil fuel industry and the financial industry. He gave them historic tax cuts. Now gas is 4 dollars or more a gallon in many places. So the temp tax cuts the middle classes received are given to big oil.

5171 2018-06-13 15:17:37 Want to stop prices from fluctuating so damn much?  Take it off the market as a buy/sell commodity .  This is much more complicated than people know.  What happens to crude oil prices when there is a threat of war?  Any guesses??
5172 2018-06-13 15:17:28 putting extra oils on your scalp messes with your natural oil/water balance, if you put oil in your hair everyday you have to wash it everyday because if you leave it for more than 24 hours it’ll make your hair weaker over time
5173 2018-06-13 15:17:22 You like that Oil though eh Dorine ?
  & the Whisky & the Fishing & Renewables & the Satelite Industry & Electronic games sector. You like them though just not the democratic voice of you neighbour.
Coveting is a sin you know !
5174 2018-06-13 15:17:18 I love spending my time oil pulling.
5175 2018-06-13 15:17:17 Perhaps, but when you have 2 completely opposing sets of values I have to wonder - oil and water..

5177 2018-06-13 15:17:01 I'm eating loads of different salads right now. My go-to dressing is a variation of olive oil and balsamic. I add herbs and spices as available. Adding chunks of different cheeses only makes the salads better :)

Saudi Arabia raises oil output to 10 mn barrels per day making 1bn dollars  a day, 365 bn dollars a year at crude oil at 77 dollars per barrel as in news

5180 2018-06-13 15:16:45 Haha!!! You blame oil prices on OPEC??? Tey were going up long before. Maybe something to do with regulations and EPA going away. Maybe also that EPA Chief is in the pocket of Oil Companies
5181 2018-06-13 15:16:43 Most important is no preheating, measure your popcorn and oil, use fresh popcorn. Please DM us the model number and date code from the bottom of the popper, and date of purchase.
5182 2018-06-13 15:16:42 "good neighbour"
No one who's got a ppl who vote for Trudeau (and it's anti-americanism BS) can be considered "good neighbour".
BTW, CND can't even develop it's own oil industry (not to mention it's a dairy cartel hostage), how many year you think would it take?

5185 2018-06-13 15:16:39 Inbox: new @IHSMarkit outlook says #PermianBasin oil production will more than double by 2023, reaching 5.4 million barrels/day. "Stunning" growth, report says.
5186 2018-06-13 15:16:38 The day ppl like you with a following start questioning it & boycotting it,  the "ecosystem" will crumble. As it the oil economy will not be as strong in the near future. Then will see who funds these leeches
5187 2018-06-13 15:16:31 Be easier all round to let Scotland take it's north sea oil and cut it adrift from the UK.
5188 2018-06-13 15:16:25 The fashion industry is the 2nd biggest polluter in the world behind the oil industry. We need fresh ideas on recycling our clothes. @zamaneodwa maybe an article on this
5189 2018-06-13 15:16:21 I’ll agree with you on this one... oil is key to keeping a health economy

From Bush to Obama none of them were saints but you're brainwashed if you believe their reasons.

5225 2018-06-13 15:13:58 U.S. inventories 100 million barrels lower than March 2017. Glut of crude oil is gone, US increase in output not enough to offset decreases elsewhere (OPEC)

5227 2018-06-13 15:13:52 I was very impressed by a journalist or historian who likened his approach to a story to drilling for oil. He pictured himself erecting a rig and boring deeper and deeper at a single point. Now I can't remember his name.
5228 2018-06-13 15:13:52 Oil glut in the US
5229 2018-06-13 15:13:51 I’ve been saying this for years.  The Saudis control the oil market, not the U.S.  They literally manipulate the price of oil whenever they feel necessary which affects the price of goods for us Americans, yet we always stand by their side.

5235 2018-06-13 15:13:13 This isn't money from the revolution. That was returned in the early 80s. This is from the much more recent sale of oil.

5238 2018-06-13 15:13:12 Difference between Iran and North Korea:  Iran exports oil - NK imports oil, specifically Russian oil.    The Russian economy is a one legged stool balancing upon the price of oil.   Price per barrel in 2016 $40 - now $65.

5246 2018-06-13 15:12:47 Health insurance makes no sense.  Insurance is used to protect oneself against casualty - the unexpected.  Health problems are expected for living things.  You insure a car against accidents, not for oil/filter changes.  Only insurance against catastrophic problems fit the model

5273 2018-06-13 15:10:39 & what if them damn Saudi run out of oil ...?!
5274 2018-06-13 15:10:37 400 GWh is, what, 6 million 70KWh cars per year (vs 1bn global fleet) removing 149,000 barrels demand in year one, and about 2.5 million barrels demand in year 17 (assumed car replacement), vs current oil demand of 100m barrels per day (~20mbopd cars). Not enough.
5275 2018-06-13 15:10:34 The oil prices match the high prices we will face from your idiotic tariffs. You don't start trade negotiations by screwing over your allies. #FakePresident #FakeBusinessman
5276 2018-06-13 15:10:23 It's not he didn't notice, he just thought no one else would.  It's a  part of the canceling the Iran Agreement, so big oil had someone else to blame for rising prices of fuel.

5286 2018-06-13 15:09:49 It was fuel oil, I swear. It was asking what you often crack to remove a lot of the excess that is made. We need petrol more than fuel oil.
5287 2018-06-13 15:09:47 Guess it’s time to. Invade another oil producing nation
5288 2018-06-13 15:09:47 The oil and gas industry is producing & exporting record amounts of both out of the U.S. instead of keeping them in the country for local use. The keystone Xl pipeline doesn't help the U.S. become energy independent since it's a pipeline for Canadian tar sands oil to be exported
5289 2018-06-13 15:09:40 I know you betta
5290 2018-06-13 15:09:36 Hmmmmm...maybe something to do w YOU as well. Bad decisions w countries that supply oil? How about opening reserve for summer months?

5292 2018-06-13 15:09:29 Well then go make another Super Duper deal with more despots and then immediately get on twitter and claim another victory for the American public while oil prices continue to rise. Tell it to OPEC, stupid. We already know. we're living it , you dope.

5302 2018-06-13 15:08:49 Rumor has it that Pruitt was placed by order of a Billionaire oil fracker who is a huge trump donor
5303 2018-06-13 15:08:48 This is our chance. The future of the Arctic Refuge is about to be decided. Join me and @TheWCS to say "Absolutely no drilling for oil and gas in the Arctic Refuge" http://1/#.WyEzfITu1Sw.twitter
5304 2018-06-13 15:08:47 50 rupees for 6 biscuits, and that too made of palm oil. It's not the 28% GST, India's biscuit industry is generally shit and deserves heavy taxation. It's a nice time to remove unhealthy biscuits from the Indian palate.

5306 2018-06-13 15:08:40 the concept isn’t even that unique idk why they’re claiming so much... Like anyone with half a brain would put the text there and make it pearled to represent oil of every PEARL
5307 2018-06-13 15:08:34 I want to ask this question,
What sense does it make spilling this refined oil to the environment, do they mean that's the very best means of disposing the product or they just don't care how its disposed as long as the producers do not have possession of it?
5308 2018-06-13 15:08:29 You walking away from the #IranDeal has driven oil prices up. Everyone fears that the Straits of Hormuz,where a large percentage of the world's oil passes through, will be closed!
You are a fool
You are #UnfitToServe and #BadForAmerica & the world
5309 2018-06-13 15:08:24 Order American oil companies subsidized by American taxpayers to lower prices-we are fucking sick and tired of paying twice.
5310 2018-06-13 15:08:22 We appreciate your concerns, Colgate is committed to sourcing responsible palm oil, palm kernel oil (PKO) and palm oil derivatives that do not contribute to deforestation, which eventually, should reduce the suffering of Orangutans. Hope this helps
5311 2018-06-13 15:08:14 How do you Buharists sleep at night with you outright lies and half truths? He spent Niger Delta oil money (which you call Commonwealth) to subsidize petrol and dollars for you. How much are you paying now?
5312 2018-06-13 15:08:02 Too much. Will strip out your natural oil. Max 2 times a day :)
5313 2018-06-13 15:07:52 Is it weird I actually like oil pulling now ? Lol

5316 2018-06-13 15:07:44 Is this going to spill out into the main stream? Will the people know why the war machine wanted regime change in Syria? Talk about a war for oil
5317 2018-06-13 15:07:42 wash yo face wit cold water & sandalwood soap then put on virgin olive oil while yo skin still wet
5318 2018-06-13 15:07:41 Time to use our own oil.
5319 2018-06-13 15:07:37 Seems your oil friendly policies aren’t doing squat for consumers. You know what brings down the cost of oil?  Alternative energy.
5320 2018-06-13 15:07:36 Why do we even still require oil?  We can send spacecraft to Mars, but we are still living in the Flintstone era on the surface of earth.  Release the alternative energy tech.  It’s time....dark to light!

5326 2018-06-13 15:07:03 From the research I read today your absolutely right.  I never realized how much we do rely on Canada.  I'm in agreement with the other post...canada should cut off the supply of oil and hydro to US, maybe he'll have more respect for your prime minister

5329 2018-06-13 15:07:01 It isn't OPEC. It's YOU. You torpedoed the Iran deal solely because Obama started the process, and hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil were moved from the market. Since you continue to violate the emoluments clause, I think you should have to personally subsidize gas costs.
5330 2018-06-13 15:07:00 You realize that the US will be the TOP oil producer in the world by 2019; so MEH.
5331 2018-06-13 15:07:00 They raise the prices in the summer cause we use WAY LESS. No heating oil being used and OPEC wants to make the same money year round so they need to raise the prices so they earn the same on less sales. Happens every summer.
5332 2018-06-13 15:06:56 No Donnie-boy OPEC didn't reduce production so they're not why oil prices are up this time, you are because you spiked US inflation with your unbacked tax cut and thus reduced the value of a dollar.
5333 2018-06-13 15:06:56 I'm aware of the FIFA regulations, Joseph. But I'm sure they could put some sod down in Lucas Oil for a 2 week period over the 2026 summer.
5334 2018-06-13 15:06:55 NO, you destabilized the oil countries by throwing away the Iran nuclear agreement.  IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT!!!
5335 2018-06-13 15:06:47 Oil/conditioner will help *a lot*, along with just wearing them a heck-ton. Worth the trouble to sound like a sheriff
5336 2018-06-13 15:06:46 the deadliest slip and slide has been created with over 50 bottles of dish wash and oil which will be the battleground for today's match
5337 2018-06-13 15:06:37 Just out oil .. That's all
5338 2018-06-13 15:06:37 Obama’s destruction of America? Trump is opening up national parks to oil and uranium mining. Opening up sanctuaries off shore for more oil. You really need to do your homework before you open your mouth. Trump is a racist and the proof is in his destruction of Obama’s legacy.
5339 2018-06-13 15:06:36 @0614_ayk あやかさん、誕生日おめでとう！！幸せになりますように健康でありますように成功しますように一年中とずっと幸運です.会う日まで楽しみにしてます。 #0614

5341 2018-06-13 15:06:18 went into my car dealership to get my oil changed and they’re having complimentary manicures... i knew i picked hyundai for a reason... 
5342 2018-06-13 15:05:52 I'll bet when Madonna wakes up, she remains completely still, looks at her Latino toyboy, and out of the side of her mouth says "Oil can".
5343 2018-06-13 15:05:48 Well Marvin, go pull up a chart of oil and you will see that it actually declined on the news of the termination of the Iran deal. The free market does a pretty job of curing imbalances, certainly worlds better than any stuffed shirt in government

5345 2018-06-13 15:05:21 We’ve been doing a school-wide project (R-Yr6) about #sustainability, specifically #PalmOil, and the kids have been LOVING it. I heard a few of them checking all the sweets/chocolate in the shop saying, “We can’t have that it’s got Palm Oil in”

5347 2018-06-13 15:05:10 Also also - I generally find that topical stuff that works really well for musculoskeletal pain (like camphor, menthol, etc.) actually makes things worse when I try using on areas where I'm having neuropathic pain, with the exception of the clove oil.

5350 2018-06-13 15:05:06 “Yea sir, we can handle all that for you today for about $1100.. & that includes your prorated discount (which was about $12 per brake pad )” ... nah I’m cool, just change the oil & I’ll handle it.
5351 2018-06-13 15:04:59 There is enough in the strategic oil reserves in Louisiana to last for (they say 53 years) but say 45.  They aren't gonna do anything "quickly".  Commander Trump suggested selling half of it.  Now.. I may be dense but would this not speed up the process of going to alternate?
5352 2018-06-13 15:04:57 YOU and GOP are responsible for gas and oil prices.
5353 2018-06-13 15:04:54 My mama went to go get a oil change and came back with a new car 
5354 2018-06-13 15:04:53 Cavalier attitude of oil industry towards the suffering they inflict+ their continued war against our climate is shocking.
I don't like Husky signs along walkways or mesh ugly fencing.
It is has 0 aesthetic or historical value.

5355 2018-06-13 15:04:53 ALL. THE. TIME.
I can’t go to Home Depot, get MY big ass truck serviced, check my oil without some idiot all trying to make me feel weak, or because I wear skirts I can’t possibly have had a daddy who owned a shop.
GOD FORBID I do “guy” shit.

5366 2018-06-13 15:04:05 oil prices are set in texas. by the price of permian basin crude, the "industry standard". stop with the lies
5367 2018-06-13 15:04:05 400 KWh by 2025 is too slow for a timely fuel transition. Global energy use is 449TWh per day; oil 161TWh per day (7 TWh per hour). No investment in fossil fuels and 4% annual production decline will leave an energy gap.
5368 2018-06-13 15:03:53 @peggy_grande What a moronic  plan to split California.  I hope you folks like getting all of your water for your showers, dishes, etc. coming out of 12 oz. Nestlé bottles.  I hope you like building new oil refineries.  I hope you like building all kinds of shit. This is asinine.
5369 2018-06-13 15:03:51 Genco Olive Oil Company had the same problem. Somebody in HR needs to get fired!
5370 2018-06-13 15:03:28 I had this case that had like a water/oil in it and it cracked and leaked all over my phone
5371 2018-06-13 15:03:26 Good thing you've got an endless supply of cheap Snake Oil to get us through, then.
-What a relief!
5372 2018-06-13 15:03:25 How about voting for the Iraq War... is that not nefarious? How many hundreds of thousands died because of that war? Anyone who voted for that immoral war for oil is not fight for POTUS or even Congress.
5373 2018-06-13 15:03:24 price of oil went up - more $$$$$

5375 2018-06-13 15:03:13 I would think with your idiotic grandstand a true dictator would probably have you shot. Anyway, no one considers you a journalist, just another snake oil salesman peddling fake news.

5377 2018-06-13 15:03:12 What regulations are preventing the U.S., which has a surplus of oil and natural gas and is exporting these in record amounts (while gas prices are high because trump keeps destabilizing the ME), from being energy independent? #maga
5378 2018-06-13 15:03:11 The will of people once again take a backseat to powerful lobbyists in Canada.Both Scheer and Trudeau will sacrifice steel,aluminum and oil industries to protect an outdated supply management policy.Shame.
5379 2018-06-13 15:03:05 It should be zero... his own fabricated case is leaking serious oil right now.

5382 2018-06-13 15:02:52 Well, i think is 5. But i still am right. The arab world has enough oil to live in peace and develop wealth care, education for everybody. But rather to trade it for american guns to kill each other. The moment the oil finish, the arab world goes to stone age.
5383 2018-06-13 15:02:49 Go ahead and blow that motor. Keep playing lol RT @twelve0too: I’m playing so bad , I need to get a oil change like yesterday!!!
5384 2018-06-13 15:02:44 Would you please push the oil price down, if you could, if we may
5385 2018-06-13 15:02:39 Oil miners sweetie. 
Get back to me when you stop using all oil / petroleum products and start walking everywhere you go. 
Until then, every snarky remark you make about the mining industry, and regulations in the field,  exposes you as a hypocrite.
5386 2018-06-13 15:02:38 There's a lot of negativity in this world but the dudes at Oil Works on Airport sure are delightful human beings doing a bang up job.

5394 2018-06-13 15:01:51 Oil prices need to stay high enough to keep America (esp ND) producing. With America production at full capacity the market will balance oil prices. $3/gal gas is not terrible. Much better than $4 in 2008.

5400 2018-06-13 15:01:35 Trump's actions with Jerusalem & Iran further increased tensions in the Middle East & those led to higher oil prices. 
Health ins premiums go up every year. In states that expanded Medicaid, those increases were smaller after the ACA was passed. Now they're getting bigger again.
5401 2018-06-13 15:01:28 Top of the hour: While ES_F printed 2 double tops, SPX translates out to a TRIPLE TOP with 2191 resistance HOD TOP. Bearish even if WHALES push  higher.

5402 2018-06-13 15:01:25 strongly disagree, there are so many whales we could be harvesting the oil from instead
5403 2018-06-13 15:01:24 It ain’t OPEC. Over the last 12 mths the demand for oil has grown by over 1.2 mill bbls/day. Supply has grown by only 0.5 mill bbls/day. We now have an undersupply gap of 0.6 mmbbls/day. Storage is now below the 5-yr avg. The economy is booming. We’re back in balance.

5408 2018-06-13 15:00:59 Your first trip as President was to Saudi Arabia so you could collide on raising oil prices as Putin requested, correct? Funny how all of our prices are shooting up... tariffs!?
5409 2018-06-13 15:00:44 So, are you going to put tariffs on oil now too? You know, really fuck America over.
5410 2018-06-13 15:00:43 Coconut oil in the evenings worked for me 
5411 2018-06-13 15:00:41 This is gross and deserving of a throat punch for not giving a damn about anyone but themselves. How is CBD oil a threat when all psychoactive substances have been removed? It ceases to be a “drug” at that point, but who cares if children with intractable seizures can’t thrive?
5412 2018-06-13 15:00:38 パイパンですか？それともまいやんですか？

5413 2018-06-13 15:00:32 The problem is all these people protesting our oil are paid to protest. They don’t care. True Canadians know it already.

It softens hard things,
It sweetens bitter things,
It is a source of light

5429 2018-06-13 14:59:11 Must be all that offshore drilling and drilling in national parks you promised us would keep the USA free of foreign oil manipulation.
5430 2018-06-13 14:59:09 Mr. President, is it possible that we could send our top scientists to study alongside the Japanese and see how they made things such as the maglev work. One of the things that drives oil prices is supply and demand so, if we start moving away from oil, the prices should drop.
5431 2018-06-13 14:59:06 There's right wing agenda in schools.
It's secular, paternalistic+elitist.
JESUS+promise of eternal life+heaven trump money.
Oil pipeline advocates have nerve. People+oceans are dying due to climate change+pollution and land is  being swallowed up by oceans. Oil mafia that killed

5435 2018-06-13 14:58:39 When the president of the United States creates 
uncertainty in the world oil prices tend to go up.

Attacking U.S. allies and buddying up to dictators? 

Not good!
5436 2018-06-13 14:58:37 Dont touch Canada's oil.
5437 2018-06-13 14:58:37 3. tertiary recovery: biasa disebut enhanced oil recovery (EOR)
biasanya untuk sumur tua, kandungan sumur tua biasanya itu minyak mentah yang berat dan kental. ya kalo di produksi cuma bisa buat aspal doang lah
5438 2018-06-13 14:58:24 So am I the only one that thinks Lemongrass essential oil smells like Froot Loops orrrr.....?¿

5440 2018-06-13 14:58:08 Sorry but what “deal”? Specifically what was that exactly? 
Only deal was you calling off our defensive military drills. 
Putin is so happy!  
you are such a snake oil salesman!
5441 2018-06-13 14:58:07 Truth is always like oil in water, No matter how much water you add to Depress it, it always floats on top.

5442 2018-06-13 14:58:04 Oil prices should be HIGHER Than they currently are to relfect the damage excess C02 is doing to our planet. It would encourage the growth of renewable energy sources whilr eliminating excess C02 in our atmosphere and oceans.

5444 2018-06-13 14:57:55 No one is paying attention to our NE BC oil.  We need to refine it here for use here.
5445 2018-06-13 14:57:52 I was directing a celebrity for a series of commercials. Felt overwhelmed. In over my head. Panic attack. Prayed to Jesus. Felt like warm oil was poured on my head. Anxiety left me from the head down. Ended up kicking ass on the shoot.

5447 2018-06-13 14:57:42 Sure, but American produced oil from oil companies say is the price at the pump isn't at least $3/gal, they lose money.  So, I'm not sold this is only an OPEC issue.
5448 2018-06-13 14:57:37 Italy @ Global today! Chicken alla diavolo- eggplant parmigiana- olive oil potatoes- asparagus! 
5449 2018-06-13 14:57:30 Nothing like self reliant.  Invest in American leading edge energy and Opec can use thier oil to fill thier swimming pools.

5455 2018-06-13 14:57:07 Romantic or crazy? Lavender oil and herbal tea party for hockey players to heal from a loss or celebrate a win. I think of this listening to Fable.

5458 2018-06-13 14:56:57 most americans have tuned out against cnn n other fake news media. they r dishonest n dont report real news such as: more jobs than workers; usa #1 in oil production; prosperity for all americans, n all the good works that r happening to improve our lives.

5460 2018-06-13 14:56:50 They want children to use pharmaceuticals that come with heavy and drastic side effects and that don’t even work. It’s all about protecting the bottom line of big pharma. CBD oil has no psychoactives in it and it works, with none of the same heavy side effects of pharmaceuticals.
5461 2018-06-13 14:56:45 Glow/Shimmer Body Oil because I love to sparkle & shine!  Thank you!
5462 2018-06-13 14:56:42 YES JUNGKOOK
5463 2018-06-13 14:56:39 Well it’s your fault for trying to destroy Iran a major oil producer and allowing Saudi Arabia unfettered control - this is why we need grownups not children in charge who can’t see the complexities of the world.

5468 2018-06-13 14:55:58 Energy East should replace some of the imported oil in the Irving refineries, (If they're adapted to refining dilbit)
They do export most of their refined product.

5472 2018-06-13 14:55:49 That's why the USA should be looking at other sustainable asslternatives...but you're hostage to your oil buddies
5473 2018-06-13 14:55:45 I thought we had a glut of oil  in the country.
Really blaming OPEC is nor the answer here, Donnie.
#GetYourFactsStraight
5474 2018-06-13 14:55:40 Did they teach you how to look at a chart of oil prices, which shows you clowns that the price is actually over 4% lower since Trump announced the withdrawal from the deal?
5475 2018-06-13 14:55:38 童貞ですか？(真顔)
5476 2018-06-13 14:55:31 So I throw my wig on all sideways and literally put anything on so they don’t try to talk to me when I get my oil changed and my grandma tells me “you’re depressed I can’t tell” 
5477 2018-06-13 14:55:24 $CHK looks like it has filled that 10% down when oil cracked a few weeks back - looking long term - nothing stands out other than potentially a bottoming process - lets see how it develops and will look a bit deeper
5478 2018-06-13 14:55:22 I use cooking oil (from checku), salt, jaggery from local sellers and vegetables as well from local shop n market and I'll not buy that from super market or from any corporate. Ok?
5479 2018-06-13 14:55:21 You're deal is a joke. It's all been done before. You're selling snake oil. You need to admit you're too stupid to do the research and understand that your deal is a no deal. #UnfitForOffice #toostupid
5480 2018-06-13 14:55:11 I discovered a great something. You grab olive oil, hand lotion or whatever you have that's working on your hands, grab two latex gloves, if you're not allergic, smear some on your hands a little in the gloves, and put on for as long as you can handle. Result = baby hands.
5481 2018-06-13 14:55:10 Omg, thank you so much! I don't have any specific questions rn! I'm getting the sense from other replies that a lot of the other stuff is for pampering/feeling extra fresh or specific skin stuff like acne or level of oil. Am I getting it? lol

5486 2018-06-13 14:54:53 Eef. Oof. A Facebook account for some brand of olive oil had an ad talking about The Truth Of Crop Circles Left By Aliens Really. Blocked for being misleading (i.e. LYING).

5500 2018-06-13 14:53:34 And according to your letter, the POTUS was on this even a month earlier.  Fortunately for us, unlike Congress over the last 10 years, @POTUS gets things done!

BTW when did the Dems become Big Oil? Shouldn't you want less oil to help fight "Climate Change"?
5501 2018-06-13 14:53:33 Won't do anything about it though, your goomba Putin loves high oil prices.  Makes him and the Russian mob even richer...and that means more money in your pocket as well as the NRAs pocket!!
5502 2018-06-13 14:53:29 As expected, the position of the oil tank and wooden panelling doesn’t meet regulations and is the likely cause of the damp issue. YAY for adult problems

Oil prices are too high, OPEC is at it again. Not good!
5507 2018-06-13 14:53:08 Mr Trump do not follow the fake news, now exist the free energy to replace the oil !
5508 2018-06-13 14:53:04 I’m playing so bad , I need to get a oil change like yesterday!!!
5509 2018-06-13 14:52:51 doterra's serenity oil helps me a lot. i rub it on my chest and behind my ear lobes. i also breathe in for ten seconds, hold it for ten seconds and exhale for ten seconds once Ive calmed down a bit to regulate my breathing.
5510 2018-06-13 14:52:50 I think the price of oil played a larger role in the economic decline of 2015. Not the NDP coming to power...
5511 2018-06-13 14:52:47 Sorry tetiba, but pagi tadi before cuci muka pakai cleanser i urut muka pakai palmers therapy oil tu pastu baru cuci muka n buat am routine. Until now, muka rasa lembut gila! Tak de excess minyak langsung.

5522 2018-06-13 14:52:01 And that was taking Oil and Gas with Cody Smith. Remember to Tune in next week!
5523 2018-06-13 14:51:53 oh good lord you don't even understand economics.  The only reason that the prices would go up with high demand is low supply.  But that's not necessarily the case right now.  Crude Oil Prices are what is affecting the price at the pump right now.
5524 2018-06-13 14:51:51 Are they putting all their oil production onto #blockchain?..
5525 2018-06-13 14:51:35 That’s a shame. Have you looked at possibly trying CBD oil

5530 2018-06-13 14:51:16 keep pulling tha demand out (oil) demand will keep rising and will keep demanding!
5531 2018-06-13 14:51:13 Gee, when @BarackObama was president, you blamed HIM for gas/oil prices. Why isn't THIS your fault, you orange sack of lies?

5535 2018-06-13 14:51:06 We have a potus not a oil man so he wants to keep prices down but got rid of regulation that can stop a housing bust like we had before
5536 2018-06-13 14:51:04 Sticky PLA with a touch of sap...yeah, a touch of oil on the filament should keep it flowing.
5537 2018-06-13 14:51:01 It is in the US's interest to support the Saudi/UAE coalition because they are large exporters of oil towards the US
5538 2018-06-13 14:51:01 Those countries have an abundance of oil and other resources. They don't recognise Israel and are  Islamic countries.

5544 2018-06-13 14:50:47 Oh Faith.   Justin doesn’t like oil.  Only cheese from PQ.
5545 2018-06-13 14:50:40 Maybe if we had some way of HANDLING Iran without just tossing more sanctions on them, like, oh...some sort of AGREEMENT...they wouldn't raise Oil Prices...And maybe if we weren't putting Tariffs on other countires, they wouldn't raise prices on us...
5546 2018-06-13 14:50:37 He knows exactly what he is doing. Raising Russian oil prices!

5548 2018-06-13 14:50:19 does Trump even know what CL price volatility is?
Just keep rolling those front month contracts for oil you will never take delivery on and the price will stay within your range of likability
5549 2018-06-13 14:50:17 My friend Obama inherited an America in recession but couldn't complain because he knew the worst that could go wrong was policies.
An oil economy that squander reserve and stole from all angles of the coffers should be blamed.
What are saying. We should forget? 
Not serious
5550 2018-06-13 14:50:09 Glad you are on it. You have always been a hawk on oil prices.

5552 2018-06-13 14:50:01 Sir it's a wonder if they are still left with any reserves at all. My doubt is why are they not engaging foreigners to dig oil and sell it?

5573 2018-06-13 14:48:26 This is all about oil. It's just a different approach then Bush. This approach is dangerous. Trump doesn't care about America's people. It's about lining their damn pockets.

5574 2018-06-13 14:48:17 bullish oil report from EIA. Demand for gasoline at record levels, so $3 unleaded isn't going away anytime soon.

5576 2018-06-13 14:47:56 I love how America forces a military coup to install a fascist dictator in a country because it's 'anti-communist' then imposes sanctions and tariffs on that country to force sale of oil at extremely low prices and then looks back to the camera like "how could socialism do this"

5578 2018-06-13 14:47:51 Oil pricing is going up everyday.  Where i live in NY it is $3.10 a gallon.  Something needs to be done, this is too high and for those that use oil for their homes like myself, it hits us that much more!
5579 2018-06-13 14:47:49 For what they don’t know CBD oil is legal in Utah
5580 2018-06-13 14:47:32 So far on Neoliberal Public Radio (NPR) they have cheered Macron breaking the backs of unions and students and argued that big monopolies like Standard Oil were actually good.
5581 2018-06-13 14:47:26 And you don't think that your stupid fussing around with tariffs has anything to do with it.  Combination of higher oil prices and increased tariff related costs have wiped out any tax gain for all except the FFR.  But then that's all you care about - the money.
5582 2018-06-13 14:47:09 This is why the US EPA excludes support support for palm oil biodiesel. Our biodiesel industry's growth has been achieved without any increase in cropland. Last annual cropland increase was in 1959. EU needs to fix its biofuels program, not give it all back to the oil industry.

5585 2018-06-13 14:46:59 U.S. #oil production hit 10.9 million barrels and will likely hit 11 million barrels soon, pushing the U.S. to the world's top oil producer. #oott
5586 2018-06-13 14:46:55 Completely agree what's missing is empirical evidence and trialed studies, which this is simply one example of - a problem endemic across contemporary HE (not least due to the education theorists peddling snake oil)

5608 2018-06-13 14:45:37 WHY DOES AN OIL CHANGE TAKE SO LONG ?!?! 
5609 2018-06-13 14:45:30 Oil prices turn higher after EIA reports a bigger-than-expected weekly fall in U.S. crude supplies
5610 2018-06-13 14:45:27 Definitely fuel oil
5611 2018-06-13 14:45:26 DOE crude oil inventories see draw of -4143K vs -1246K expected. Oil rises. USDCAD continues fall.
5612 2018-06-13 14:45:25 Again, as an economist I under stand economics of it all. You're under the assumption Exxon and Chevron want low oil prices...why? The economy is well and employment is high.
5613 2018-06-13 14:45:23 Oil prices are also high because some dickhead is creating uncertainty in the global economy. Wonder who that might be?
5614 2018-06-13 14:45:17 #oott  History:  3/21/18, FOMC raised rates by .25.  Which way did oil go?

5679 2018-06-13 14:40:32 Twice in the last 12 years, oil has crashed. The most recent was due to a surplus of 2%. A mere 2% surplus in oil sent prices from $130/barrel to $50/barrel. Drilling stops (we watched rig counts world-wide very closely) during a surplus, prices are forced to drop.

5709 2018-06-13 14:38:21 Hey, let’s fix oil prices with one of those cool punitive tariffs? Those are really easy to win, right?
5710 2018-06-13 14:38:20 This is not true. The manufacturing of gasoline takes a lot of energy to mine, refine, and transport. I did the math once, and the electricity used to refine a gallon of gas could power a Model S for 17 miles. Add to that the energy costs of extracting crude oil and shipping it.
5711 2018-06-13 14:38:14 Oil shouldn't matter as much these days, but you and you oil billionaire buddies refuse to embrace progress by alternatives which should be making it so oil gets phased down
5712 2018-06-13 14:38:11 .  I’m afraid that if some certain SOS wins the primary, the phrase “the squeaky wheel gets the oil” comes to mind over who ever is the D nominee.  Same if Gov Colyer wins, although he’s the governor and should be in the news depending on what is going on in KS.

5717 2018-06-13 14:37:52 It’s not OPEC! The high oil prices are entirely because of you withdrawing the US commitment to the Iran Nuclear Deal, and all of the Middle East instability that has caused. But hey, I’m sure your dictator benefactor Putin is cashing in because of it.

He'll either send troops into Alberta to get the oil, or try to annex the Maritimes because it's easier to cut off from the rest.
5728 2018-06-13 14:37:20 Omg Vicki, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Iraq has more oil. We are #13 out of the 15 largest oil producers. As for fresh water we come in at #4 behind Canada, Russia and #1 brazil. As for hydro we import from canada their surplus

5739 2018-06-13 14:36:31 Hence the we don't have state-run oil... Do you think they have incentive to stabilize price? Why would Exxon want to lower price? OPEC's policy often helps U.S. firms. They can drive up reserves and cash. They aren't our advocates.

5800 2018-06-13 14:32:54 Oil is priced according to the value of the dollar. When the value of the dollar declines, as it is now, oil prices rise.

5856 2018-06-13 14:30:50 I know how it works very well (I spent 10 years in the drilling business). Here's the thing, more drilling will lower cost per barrel. However, more drilling can lead to a surplus in oil, which can be bad. A 2% surplus a few years ago lead to oil bottoming out. So it's delicate.

5906 2018-06-13 14:28:00 oil prices started rising when you canceled the Iran deal. coincidence? your actions brought instability to the oil costs. btw Iran upheld their part of the deal, still are but now they work with Russia instead of us. only part of that deal you didn't like was Obama's involvement
5907 2018-06-13 14:27:59 Keep insulting Canada and think about the fact that the USA gets more oil from Canada than any other single country in the world......maybe they should consider raising their prices too?
5908 2018-06-13 14:27:55 Not OPEC's fault. Our fault. Our oil is not staying in the U.S. If ur putting America first, as u often say, u'll use OUR oil 2 relieve out of control gas price gouging, instead of sending it overseas.

5971 2018-06-13 14:23:22 Start using US oil shit em down. Keep our oil here. Youll mess the whole thing up and America wins!
5972 2018-06-13 14:23:21 Are you taking the piss? The white paper has since been proven to be the biggest pile of lies ever published, what about Salmonds legal advice?? The price of oil?? The entire case for Independence was based on lies and untruths!!!
5973 2018-06-13 14:23:15 Good thing you loaded off two other oil suppliers, Canada and Mexico
5974 2018-06-13 14:23:14 Pretty sure the CIA planned 9/11 lol but sure blame Saudi cuz they own oil. And PS I'm not a Islam supporter, actually think every religion has turned into just another way to keep ppl under control. #Compartmentalization
5975 2018-06-13 14:23:13 I saw that. How? Are they drowning in oil? Than amount of veg should be like 150 calories. 580 calories of veg is probably an entire veg buffet.

5980 2018-06-13 14:22:57 Homie at the oil change spot just tried to sell me a new damn car
5981 2018-06-13 14:22:57 The IMF may have been at the door but it later appeared that they were not actually required - HM Treasury lied to the Goverment about the state of the finances. And what happended to the North Sea Oil money? Major invetment in infra' was promised.

5983 2018-06-13 14:22:50 Higher oil prices generally equal a strong economy. It’s not always a bad thing with jobs returning, cities will benefit from increased spending.
5984 2018-06-13 14:22:50 Kan kalau pakai oil mesti basuh semula dengan water based kan? So takpe ke macam 4 kali jeee pakai water based cleanser 
5985 2018-06-13 14:22:48 Previous "deals" did the same as Obama Administration did with Iran: 1st the enemy gets all they want (from oil,food,money given by various Admins to NK to Obama flying gold&money&giving access to USA monetery market) than we get NOTHING as we "negotiated" as fools
5986 2018-06-13 14:22:48 You did just start trade war with Canada who can now export its oil elsewhere. We’ll have to turn to probable OPEC member to replace what we were getting from Canada. Hmmm...a LOT of prices to go up..
5987 2018-06-13 14:22:48 You need to wash ur head wiv anointing oil. Bruh!
5988 2018-06-13 14:22:47 You can always release some of the strategic reserves to bring the price of oil and gas down. But that would be too smart for you to figure out,
5989 2018-06-13 14:22:41 Money, money, money...that is all oil companies think about.
5990 2018-06-13 14:22:36 FG should learn from the oil thieves how to construct simple refinery instead of the wastage abroad.We are still economically slaves to few thieves abroad.
5991 2018-06-13 14:22:33 Yeh put it on paper towel and try it out lol. Don’t eat the oil or grease
5992 2018-06-13 14:22:20 I can change my own oil, air filter ain’t shit, rotate tires.....but I’m a lazy SOB and would rather watch Netflix while I pay someone else to do it 
5993 2018-06-13 14:22:13 I have been hearing that CBD oil is helping out with anxiety.

5996 2018-06-13 14:22:03 OPEC is a cartel of oil mafia... trying to extort as much as possible before they go bonkers in destitution again. India must invest heavily in R and D for electric vehicles..light as well as heavy duty
5997 2018-06-13 14:22:01 Our society doesn't seem designed to give ordinary established citizens the best possible life. Govt sanctions so many rip-offs from oil to loans to phone & utility companies that exist to exploit. They hush up so much including cancer causing chemicals & Whitehall sex scandals.
5998 2018-06-13 14:21:55 Bill waited weeks for you to give the surface cost of North Sea oil.  What figure do you have. ?   Ps Venezuela has shitloads to but they can’t eat it. It not what you hope it is.  Do you understand ecconomics and the need for PROFIT ?
5999 2018-06-13 14:21:52 Fake news is the USAs biggest enemy? Thought it was terrorism, migrants, oil prices and trade tariffs 
6000 2018-06-13 14:21:48 Simple math#SDF is the only #US  ally in syria. #sdf is the only party that sells oil to #assad used to kill syrian ppl & US forces ( tanf + Der Al Zour). The #SDF can’t  be ally & partner in this crimes at the same time. If SDF is doing this 2 US imagine what ll do to the Arab
6001 2018-06-13 14:21:45 In short, let's use USA Oil, reduce prices to beef up economy and throw them for a loop!

6003 2018-06-13 14:21:33 Wrong we get a discount on Canadian oil.
6004 2018-06-13 14:21:31 Americans in general. Trump has said he will punish the Canadian people. But he forgets that we supply a good percentage of water, hydro and most of the oil. If Trudeau decides to retaliate things could get very difficult for the American people. But it’s not what I want to see.
6005 2018-06-13 14:21:23 Oil prices are up, because an orange person, is busy destabilising the global economy.
6006 2018-06-13 14:21:23 Bet they’re as slick as their oil. Gah.

6026 2018-06-13 14:19:40 We also have enough oil via ANWAR and other American lands that we could be significantly independent on energy which would defund terrorism worldwide very significantly.
6027 2018-06-13 14:19:37 Where do you think we get our oil from now how do you think we got to this place
6028 2018-06-13 14:19:36 We continue to be assaulted by the Art of the Lie. US gets played by N. Korea & snake oil @POTUS declares victory. His “enemy of the people” must work to save Democracy.

I remember when democrats were for working people. You are only for illegals who take black jobs and keep wages down

6052 2018-06-13 14:18:07 Well the distribution of wealth isn’t a function of trade. However overall the UK was a much smaller economy. As I remember the IMF were close to the door and Northsea oil wasn’t making things better.
6053 2018-06-13 14:17:58 No, no, no. The oil prices are high because YOU cancelled the Iran deal and reimposed sanctions on Iran. You caused oil prices to rise and you alone. At least when you have your update phone call with Putin, you can have a laugh at how the democratic masses are suffering. #waster

6060 2018-06-13 14:17:11 I meant with higher oil prices I would assume E&P companies globally would have restarted their investment plans including those were cancelled during price crash
6061 2018-06-13 14:17:10 We get a lot of our oil from Canada and you just pissed them off bigly. This is all on you, but per usual, you find someone else to blame.

6063 2018-06-13 14:16:57 Two of my favorite ladies on MSNBC, 

Does anyone tell Trump that the US imports more oil from Canada than anywhere else? Maybe Ms Freeland should speak in a language he understands “It’s a nice energy system you have down there, be a shame if anything happened to it”
6064 2018-06-13 14:16:50 Nigeria used export palm oil to Singapore now its vice versa
6065 2018-06-13 14:16:40 I wish there was a way we can produce are own oil here in the states so we don’t have to deal with foreign oil.

6070 2018-06-13 14:16:15 So, in other words, it's more correct to view current global oil storage as "30 days inventory on hand" (3 billion/100 mmbpd)... is that right?

6088 2018-06-13 14:15:11 As expected ...oil glut which drove prices lower is ending & prices up due to: heightened tensions in Syria(Trump) & threat of new sanctions on Iran & Venezuela (Trump).

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
6105 2018-06-13 14:14:13 At least water doesn't stain, unlike the huge amount of oil that ended up on my best linen shirt on Saturday nights. #Messierthanyoucouldbeeverbe
6106 2018-06-13 14:14:08 Not could it will !!  Enjoy your $4000 dollar Tv's and your $120,000 dollar cars ,,. And since Canada sells you 40% of your gas and oil ....filling your 120,000 dollar car up once will be all you can afford......so much winning
6107 2018-06-13 14:14:05 No doubt I’ve donated 1.765 kilos of coconut oil to TSA since 2005. Lot of airport employees with tight waves out there #TravelTweets
6108 2018-06-13 14:13:59 What's a matter, Trump, can't do what President Obama was able to do and LOWER oil prices?  I guess throwing wind and solar technology out wasn't such a good idea after all.
6109 2018-06-13 14:13:58 Public consumption of marijuana (smoking only) can have lingering smells that might irritate people that don’t partake. Kinda like second hand smoke... so I understand why it may never work. Oil pens for MJ are the shit tho... no smell!! 
6110 2018-06-13 14:13:52 Why yes ma'am, I have been checkin out your ass for 3 aisles now. Coconut oil is down aisle 4 and ky is at the pharmacy if you're wondering
6111 2018-06-13 14:13:51 "In Greece, which consumes more olive oil than any other country, it is traditional to drink half a cup of extra virgin olive oil with lime water every morning to stay slim, prevent hunger pangs and increase longevity."
6112 2018-06-13 14:13:51 @morningmika With interest rates rising and fuel costs high construction will soon slow to a crawl. Why we ask are these things that affect real Americans happening? Pretty simple. Trump pulled out of the Iran deal and we list 500000 gal of import oil daily.
6113 2018-06-13 14:13:50 I suppose it is fitting he got the big oil company exec out of his cabinet before he started tweeting along this line.

6115 2018-06-13 14:13:37 Especially considering the oil and natural-gas resources therein inherent.
6116 2018-06-13 14:13:35 I still don’t understand why it takes an hour for an oil change 
6117 2018-06-13 14:13:33 Yea let’s just buy our oil from a very  Authoritarian country whose leaders force Shia Islam on their civilians and the civilians are close to putting up revolutions against their rulers (Iran)
6118 2018-06-13 14:13:32 I hear we can drill in the gulf again, rather than England, and Large new oil fields found in Texas, and Alaska's oil, we should be able to export oil rather than have the Saudi's hold us over a barrel.  Lets use our resources.

6121 2018-06-13 14:13:21 Better yet he destroys those alliances on trade. And b/c you lacked the depth to ask or fear finding out, I’ll help you w/the answer. Because @PutinRF_Eng & Russia benefit through rising oil & gas prices&helping it gain desperately needed hard currency.

6123 2018-06-13 14:13:06 Maybe you don’t understand the relationship between oil prices and your actions in the Middle East (e.g Iran)

6125 2018-06-13 14:13:06 “It’s not the gifting that breaks the yoke, it’s the anointing. We need more anointed people who are willing to go through the crushing so that there is oil.”  @ChristineCaine
6126 2018-06-13 14:13:00 A snake oil salesman, who again negotiated absolutely nothing. Your only interest is in expanding your Trump businesses to NK. You don’t care one bit about the people of the US.
6127 2018-06-13 14:12:55 The Oil and Gas industry receives more tax breaks, subsidies and the like than any other industry, plus, communities shoulder the burden of all the pollution--carbon and methane, you are pumping into the atmosphere. Its time to keep oil and gas in the ground where is belongs.
6128 2018-06-13 14:12:54 We’re killing our oil industry and simultaneously subsidizing milk. We’re shooting ourselves in the head is what we’re doing. What next? Kill the forestry industry and subsidize surfboard manufacturers?  We’re giving up our advantage.

6130 2018-06-13 14:12:51 He's sold all his oil shares and is looking for a lower entry. Market manipulation.
6131 2018-06-13 14:12:49 I see a bear flag on longer term oil chart here. But it is merely developing. #CL_F
6132 2018-06-13 14:12:48 Y'all need to chill out about Russian interference when you plebiscit US imperialistic thirst for oil wars worldwide. You're obscene and belong to the war crimes enthusiasts that still make innocent lives taken daily in the name of evil.
6133 2018-06-13 14:12:48 Tried my first dose of CBD oil for my stomach pain this morning started slow & low with 20 mg.
6134 2018-06-13 14:12:45 Fran got his facts wrong. We are not #1 In ANYTHING.  Not water supply #4, not hydro, and definitely not the largest supplier of oil we are #13 out 15.

6136 2018-06-13 14:12:39 @realDonaldTrump Just a thought but maybe you shouldn't piss off the country that supplies the US with things it needs like oil, lumbar, water and power for most of the east coast

Just a thought
6137 2018-06-13 14:12:38 wish CDB Oil wasn't so FREAKING expensive.....
6138 2018-06-13 14:12:33 Probably financial reasons, just like Chicago, Minneapolis and St’ Louis, it was all too expensive and the cities withdrew their names. Also could have something to do with Lucas Oil being a closed roof dome. Most players have never played in something closed up like that before

what ever happened to good ol' oil money. nobody cares about oil money anymore
6143 2018-06-13 14:12:17 Gosh, you negotiated in such good faith and those mean kids still set oil pwices higher? Would you like Daddy to go talk with them, pobrecito?

6146 2018-06-13 14:12:07 hey, drink warm water (it eases your throat) and go to sleep as early as you can. you have a fever, it's not good to stay up late! if it gets worse, drink paracetamol. for the flu, do you happen to have peppermint essential oil there?
6147 2018-06-13 14:12:01 Nothing to do with OPEC you orange buffoon it's your trade war along with Iran etc ....like you suddenly care though about oil prices..this isn't harming just the us it's harming across the globe
6148 2018-06-13 14:12:01 And thats why i neverrrrrrr come do the oil change on my own car cusz they ALWAYS try to get me
6149 2018-06-13 14:11:47 I hate when girls tweet about coconut oil as much as the next person, but let me tell ya something- every since I started drinking it daily () my lips are so fucking soft omg
6150 2018-06-13 14:11:46 Said the very same thing at PC - it’s in the RNS history ended up with a bullshit jar of “oil” and a couple of dancing squirrels #msmn
6151 2018-06-13 14:11:45 #Indian #Oil demand grew at the slowest rate in 8 months. Is it a long awaited structural shift of Indian mindset towards low oil consumption? Or just a temporary phenomenon due to price rise? #crudeoil #finance #nymex #WTI #brent
6152 2018-06-13 14:11:43 If US were energy independent and we stopped protecting ME oil production and supply routes, wouldn’t we be better off?  What would happen if ME production destroyed but America had oil to sell? Would we be rich like Dubai and Saudi?
6153 2018-06-13 14:11:34 "sana oil"

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
6154 2018-06-13 14:11:28 You mean the Us had a deficit? The US has trade and services had surplus with Canada. As for the deficit in goods you usually have, they are mostly related to energy. You don’t want to close the tap on oil or electricity, the prices of gas would skyrocket.
6155 2018-06-13 14:11:26 low oil prices are quite enough.
6156 2018-06-13 14:11:25 If we're now supposedly energy independent and selling oil, why would we buy any oil from the Middle East?
6157 2018-06-13 14:11:20 Rosehip oil mixed with a carrier oil (almond, olive, grapeseed)..... it improved mine a lot.
6158 2018-06-13 14:11:12 the highest price of oil is in China.

6161 2018-06-13 14:10:54 Time to release millions of gallons from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve and refill it from the Anwat Oil Field
6162 2018-06-13 14:10:46 Fuel oil
6163 2018-06-13 14:10:45 Maybe thats because there’s unease in the middle east, which has the oil you want. So quit bitching, you did this to us! Not OPEC-YOU with your deliberate move of the embassy. Caused a civil war. Gee wonder why gas is high? #stupidpotus! #WorstPresidentEver
6164 2018-06-13 14:10:40 Encourage your people to use olive oil for cooking over vegetable oil + to avoid Ghee especially.  Ghee is artery clogging is it not, veg oil can increase cancer risks.
6165 2018-06-13 14:10:29 Yes. I’d argue that too. It contributed. Oil was at $150 then along with delayed impact of mortgage resets from an aggressive Fed rate hike path... all magnified by financial leverage.

6172 2018-06-13 14:10:06 Tr**p statements and manner of speech are geared at people who believe snake oil salesmen & washing machine ads. They 'hope' to get a good deal w/o knowing why they should.

6174 2018-06-13 14:09:47 without a doubt in my mind i want us to become a socialist country it is the only thing that will save us as a country and help us progress as a whole. Venezuela only went to shit bc of the drastic fall in oil prices which accounts for 95% of the countries income nothing else
6175 2018-06-13 14:09:47 Sorry, said that backwards. It's far cheaper by pipe. Pipes are safer, but the greenies think it's not because the tar sands oil is more corrosive.
6176 2018-06-13 14:09:44 Oil prices went up when you blew up the Iran deal.
6177 2018-06-13 14:09:34 Thinking of trying CBD oil to get some shoulder pain relief but I have no idea where to purchase it in Indianapolis.
Suggestions?
6178 2018-06-13 14:09:30 Maybe it was not a good idea to undermine the Iran nuclear agreement, creating instability in the oil market.

6181 2018-06-13 14:09:24 The reason oil is high, is because you backed out of the deal genius...

6184 2018-06-13 14:08:50 Alberta oil is heavy and requires more energy to process it into gasoline or other refined oil products. That’s why the Western Canadian Select (WCS)—representative of the price of oil from Canada’s oil sands delivered at Hardisty, Alberta—trades at a $10 or more discount.

6186 2018-06-13 14:08:38 #OPEC is only one piece of this puzzle.

Bubble of shale oil supply drove down price leading many shale oil makers to become uneconomic and close

Summer demand in USA and summer formulations always drive up price

Simple minded explanation from your simple mind fails again
6187 2018-06-13 14:08:37 Serious question: Doesn't three billion barrels of oil in storage, which could absorb a 1 MMB/D shortfall for *nine years,* suggest we're actually fine for the time being?

It’s should be expected. Like when @realDonaldTrump destabilized #Healthcare for all those people who needed it.  He hasn’t done anything but help #InsuranceCEO’s make more money by spiking premiums.
6194 2018-06-13 14:07:44 With high oil prices the E&P industry has restarted investment again?
6195 2018-06-13 14:07:42 With technological advances spurring record levels of production, which in turn is improving U.S. energy security and driving greater oil and natural gas exports, the United States is poised to be a major player in the global market for years to come.
6196 2018-06-13 14:07:37 You blamed Obama when oil prices soared. Own it.
6197 2018-06-13 14:07:20 Another lie. You drove up the price of oil for your puppet master, Vladimir Putin.

6210 2018-06-13 14:05:54 He does realize that the U.S. only gets about 10% of its oil from OPEC nations, right????
6211 2018-06-13 14:05:51 So the oil your getting from Canada at $20 a barrel is a good deal?
6212 2018-06-13 14:05:49 I just wanted my oil changed though!
6213 2018-06-13 14:05:39 Do something good about oil here in NY and other states!!!
6214 2018-06-13 14:05:25 phyto duluuuu
essence dipake setelah toner, baru serum, trs moisturizer alias pelembap(in your case nr), baru facial oil kleveru tadii..soalnya yaa balik ke tadi ya kalo nr kan gel, jd water based kl dipake setelah kleveru gak bisa nyerap kecuali emg mau dipake sbg sleeping mask
6215 2018-06-13 14:05:08 It would be smart on the part of the US if we ramped up oil production at home now (despite what many of these nearsighted governors may say). This helps two fold for one we can actually diminish OPEC’s influence & two we can lower trade def w/ Canada, Mexico, etc.
6216 2018-06-13 14:05:01 Not finding that in reality. Gas was much higher in former admin.Oil/Gas CO’s are renting equip, not buying-learning to produce at lower bbl/mmcf price.Carpools for laborers,low end. More ppl working in households in my area-gas still belo $3.

You brought us Trump with your votes and you soon will pay for that folly. EU, Canadian and Mexican tarrifs are targeted to rain down on your heads.Your winters are cold and Canadian oil will be out of your reach Wake up and make Congress work for you. 
6233 2018-06-13 14:03:58 I’m sure your oil buddies are making a fortune off the American people, again.

6235 2018-06-13 14:03:56 Why is it the minute the economy is doing well the oil has to cost more for the working class? Both the gas to drive to this falls heating oil ? No one can convince me this is not contrived
6236 2018-06-13 14:03:54 Go get em!  While you are at it, can you explain how oil prices go up and the next day gas prices go up?  Then oil goes down and 3 weeks later we get a incremental change?   Just curious as we know that prices at the pump are directly tied to oil prices. Kind of...
6237 2018-06-13 14:03:42 It's time for us to be energy independent, and get out of middle east oil. Make the world buy from us. #Amerciafirst #Energyindependent
6238 2018-06-13 14:03:42 office for the day...#Motul#oil things
6239 2018-06-13 14:03:35 This will cause people to stay home and not spend money on vacations. So that means economy crash coming, unless oil prices stay low so people can afford to go places.
6240 2018-06-13 14:03:27 A good start will be to lock Cruella D’Ville and Comrade Sullivan out of the London Stadium. Oh, and boiling oil over the gates so they get the hint.
6241 2018-06-13 14:03:27 Stop exporting Our oil and use it to bring down  Our oil and gas prices
6242 2018-06-13 14:03:26 More US oil is needed - Alaska, offshore, shale, etc
6243 2018-06-13 14:03:24 Solar power generation is high priority, gas and oil from coal is on its way for trucking logistics. Bio fuel from sugarcane is on priority which shall be added up to 15 percent. This will make at least 30 pc lesser dependent on crude oil. Northeast is full of freaking gas, next
6244 2018-06-13 14:03:23 And after that, Hillary was beaten by an orange haired snake oil salesman moonlighting as a game show host. All because even with her vast political experience she was beaten with tricks using the electoral college.
6245 2018-06-13 14:03:16 I exfoliate my face ever two weeks with sugar & olive oil said this plenty of times lol but you’re welcome
6246 2018-06-13 14:03:16 I'm guessing that Trump will want to buy Russian oil directly.
6247 2018-06-13 14:03:11 My skin is so red/irritated omg I made the right choice to stop using this cleanser/cleansing oil after the first day
6248 2018-06-13 14:03:05 Agree, & other industries too as FDI reverts to pre-JCPOA sanction level.. but in terms of oil related its been E&P & DnSt..
Key problem POTUS will face is that OPEC Spare Capacity(SC) is depleting alarmingly fast & you don't want a situation where OPEC-SC is largely Iranian-SC

6250 2018-06-13 14:02:57 When will we see $4.00 a gallon on the East Coast?
What percent of American cars are driving on oil from Muslim countries or from Russia?

By the way, Russians want the high prices. Their economy depends on high oil prices.
6251 2018-06-13 14:02:43 I wonder if OPEC will get credit when oil prices go down
6252 2018-06-13 14:02:29 It's not the oil prices!
Oil was over $100 under Carter, but gas was under $2.00, even in CA!
6253 2018-06-13 14:02:07 PDP tookover a Nigeria from a military that Buhari's oga, abacha, had raped with corruption even at a time when oil was <$18/b yet Nigeria made progress and didn't go into recession untill a year into Buhari's govt

6260 2018-06-13 14:01:25 They don’t discriminate. They’ll serve anyone. Are you against big oil too? Still have tires on the road?
6261 2018-06-13 14:01:16 Yes but what was oil capex in 2008 in 2018 dollars and what was the percentage drop in 2009 in oil capex from 2008 peak. In any case capex is rising now not falling and it’s still an open question of whether oil capex growth outweighs the drag of high gas prices in the economy.
6262 2018-06-13 14:01:07 @VP when a person turns their back from their faith, all that that person believes becomes nothing. Politics and Religion are like oil and water. Choose your path.

6264 2018-06-13 14:00:58 A meme? PNoy was the only one who stood up to China so anyone who says he sold us out is STUPID. What do you mean what's wrong with a weak peso? It's good for export but we import more than export. We import oil & with a weak peso it becomes expensive, tough on consumers.
6265 2018-06-13 14:00:58 You knew exiting the Iran Deal would drive up oil pricing by preventIng Iran from selling oil into the market. #LIAR #LIEGATE #FUCKTRUMP

Relative to the Vienna Production Baseline of October 2016 (2.07MMBOEPD), #VZ oil production is down by 680KBOEPD @DolarToday
6297 2018-06-13 13:58:59 Trump’s tweets won’t change the supply and demand curve for oil.The market will decide the price,not Trump.
6298 2018-06-13 13:58:58 Bone spur have you heard of Solar energy? That's what was keeping oil prices down. but you screwed that up now your paying the price. Your the only one I know that would fuck up a wet dream.  You POS.
6299 2018-06-13 13:58:47 Rumsfeld stopped the $$$payments to NK, but it might have been restarted...just to clarify.
NK has been trading 'remains' with US for heavy oil, food, and it seems a light water nuclear reactor at one point.
But, the programs have always run into trouble.
Interesting history.
6300 2018-06-13 13:58:36 Oil prices are high what about your daughter and your son in law making 82million dollars last year?? Conflict of interest. They work for us not for u and making that kind of money is ridiculous
6301 2018-06-13 13:58:33 aku harap aku pakai tea oil amende tah ni boleh hilangkan sikit laa jerawat bodoh yang baru naik macam gampang haihh #donemeroyanpasaljerawat
6302 2018-06-13 13:58:26 Okay ... then they should stay out of it and let the free market do its thing.

I really don't understand why you would want the same (accused) greedy politicians to be involved in getting more oil plants in the US. Kinda weird there Andyman ..
6303 2018-06-13 13:58:17 You get most of your oil from Canada which is not a member of Opec but thanks to you, that may change in the not too far off future. Or were you planning to put tariffs on Canadian oil as well to protect those coal jobs?
6304 2018-06-13 13:58:04 Ahh, good old Scottish bitterness. Us English thrive on it. 

Regarding Oil - Perhaps your ancestors should of been harder. Perhaps you wouldn't of had your arses kicked back over the border time after time if they were. Being soft is a hereditary trait I'm afraid. 
6305 2018-06-13 13:58:01 The oil and gas industry provides jobs. It also provides environmental liabilities that are not adequately funded or dealt with. Albertans have accepted this trade off. But now with the Redwater dec we're being asked to mortgage ourselves even more. Why should we? Industry dying.

6309 2018-06-13 13:57:47 Didn’t the oil prices go up because of trump reneging on the international deal with Iran

6317 2018-06-13 13:56:48 This is threat-without selling their oil, where does funding cme from? Iran will begin uranium enrichmnt at Fordow plant -will install new nuclear equipment at  Natanz facility if it withdraws frm nuclear deal with major powers, said spokesman 4 Atomic Energy Organization of Iran
6318 2018-06-13 13:56:21 That's not how that works. Prices are set based on supply and demand, no matter where the oil we process comes from. Even if we produced and refined 100% of our own oil, the price would still be market based. Unless you want to get all Commie/Socialist about it.
6319 2018-06-13 13:56:13 TARIFF ON OPEC OIL!
6320 2018-06-13 13:55:49 Iran sells its oil in the black market at steep discounts like the Kurds, during sanctions

6327 2018-06-13 13:55:29 As if high oil prices were bad do begin with. It's quite good if they shoot up and stay that way, because it encourages deleveraging from an environmentally harmful energy source in the long run. People will learn to use it more efficiently or find alternatives.
6328 2018-06-13 13:55:27 Always, but that's a smaller impact of seasonal supply & demand. Venezuela is a major impact, one that requires stabilization by other large oil producers, which OPEC & the US have been doing fairly well over the past year, but it must continue.
6329 2018-06-13 13:55:27 My son is at camp, and I'll be spending the next 1-2 hours waiting for my car to get an oil change. So glad I remembered to bring a book.
6330 2018-06-13 13:55:27 Amen. After 9/11 I hoped President Bush was going tp announce a push for the USA to fully develop our fossil fuel industries to curtail our dependence on foreign oil. But no, he got us into Iraq. That money would have built LOTS of coal-to-gasoline plants. Fracking saved us.
6331 2018-06-13 13:55:20 my bf recommended me to apply oil in my hair and even tho ive heard of it before i never tried but yeah guess what i have applied in my hair now.
6332 2018-06-13 13:55:18 Oil and gas won't be replaced in the near future but innovation will decrease it's role. And I think the industry is noting that citizens are more awake than we were before Kalamazoo. We've got the information that was kept from us or that we did not want to face in AB. Lies told

6337 2018-06-13 13:54:39 Everyone knows that INSTABILITY in the Middle East INCREASES OIL PRICES. When you move the US Embassy to Jerusalem and violate the Iran Deal, that creates instability. America is headed toward severe #Trumpflation, thanks to your recklessness and tariffs.

6342 2018-06-13 13:54:26 Or how about we just use our resources to keep them out of the country in the first place?  Gotta believe that’s easier than trying to chase them once they’re inside our borders.
6343 2018-06-13 13:54:19 Somewhere at Twitter I read that solar power is apparently more contaminating than fossil fuel, when considering the costs of mining the panel materials. I honestly think it's a hoax custom-built by Big Oil, but if the papers are out there I'd rather switch to wind power.
6344 2018-06-13 13:54:11 And owning over 500 companies reminds me of the snake oil salesman who leaves town when people start to get wise, then sets up shop somewhere else. Outrunning the lawsuits and paying off those who complain.
6345 2018-06-13 13:54:06 Good luck
6346 2018-06-13 13:54:02 Ooooooh, but this is what you and Putin wanted, isn't it?  Russia is the biggest oil producer and needed an upswing in prices so their coffers could be further grown to pay off you and other corrupt politicians around the world to further Russian chaos interests.
6347 2018-06-13 13:53:58 What about rice bran oil?

6350 2018-06-13 13:53:39 I thought Putin loved high oil prices.
6351 2018-06-13 13:53:31 Well yes,we do want the oil industry but we don't want the lies. It's possible to be open and tell us the truth.That there have for eg been fracking accidents. That Jessica Ernst is being screwed in the court system to protect the exposed behinds of the industry. Don't lie to us.

6359 2018-06-13 13:52:03 That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard in my life. We produce more oil than nearly every other country in the world. Refining capacity is what hurts prices. I should know I worked in the welding field in refineries and plants all my life. Ignorance is bliss.
6360 2018-06-13 13:52:00 I dont think you have gone far enough. This is where the grab comes in for the New World Order, with the $$ reigning supreme and the Banks controlling the planet.(Notice several Nations dont trade oil in $$$ anymore and manage to get Invaded)

6364 2018-06-13 13:51:16 Marib was the first target of the Saudis and they settled there militarily from the beginning of the war on. Saudis aim to control the output of oil where ever they can. Arada can't do anything without Saudi consent and Saudis will never give up clinching Marib.
6365 2018-06-13 13:51:15 Fran, Fran, fran.  Out of the top 15 oil producing nations the US comes in at 13th. Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq and Canada are the top 4. As for hydro electric. WE import from Canada. In Fact New England & New York IMPORT 60% of hydro from canada.

Dry hair? Coconut oil
Yeast infection? Coconut oil!!!
6372 2018-06-13 13:50:50 If it were the free-market oil would be about 25 to $30 a barrel and gas would be a dollar a gallon. That's what I'm willing to pay for fuel. But I'm not willing I am forced to pay $4 no matter what I need 5 gallons of gas every day every day every day
6373 2018-06-13 13:50:48 I feel like this person just asked why oil and water can't just stop not mixing.
6374 2018-06-13 13:50:45 Does it always take an hour to get your oil changed or am I just impatient?

“Heh, we just scored on your goalie twice.”
6378 2018-06-13 13:50:35 Mr. President, it's not just OPEC, it's the oil companies. Remember, we get most of our oil from domestic and Canadian sources and we are also an oil exporter, so we are a big part of the problm.

6385 2018-06-13 13:50:13 #Iran: Economic Uncertainty Following Trump’s Decision to Exit Nuclear Deal
For weeks the crude oil prices have been rising. They were even breaching the US$80 a barrel mark. However, the situation is now going the other way. The rise was a direct effect...ncr-iran.org/en/news/ec
6386 2018-06-13 13:50:12 Evraz should be primary focused on pyrolysis reactors from aluminum iron alloy , Hemp carbon is the most important aspect in innovating carbon capacitors  that are a fraction cheaper than rare lithium, oil industry is degenerate, that's why most of my town up for sale...

6388 2018-06-13 13:50:10 We know this is a LIE...another damn lie.  Oil prices have gone up because of your screwing around in the world and what you have done with the oil producing countries.  DO NOT LIE...WE ARE SMARTER THAN YOU THINK.
6389 2018-06-13 13:50:07 Very excited for this report... hoping @oilfractals is recovering well from all that humping last week 
6390 2018-06-13 13:50:04 You ungrateful  
You know that Saudi Arabia  is the biggest beneficiary of high oil!
6391 2018-06-13 13:49:59 No. Your policies have a direct correlation on the price of oil. You have disrupted in a bad way. Trade wars, inflation, higher debt all rest at your feet.
6392 2018-06-13 13:49:54 True. But seems to me Trump only needs a low oil price until the midterms are done. Seems to me that a tit-for-tat is possible. Saudis and maybe Russians increase production up to midterms, driving down oil prices, and afterward Trump sanctions Iran, putting pressure on the price
6393 2018-06-13 13:49:54 Redwater dec should indicate to all citizens that the oil industry will be allowed to legally walk away from the environmental liabilities when bankrupt. The system is pretty neat. Wonder how y'all keep doing this spin decade after decade? As for fracking, y'all 100% accurate?

6409 2018-06-13 13:48:27 Final point, once trend is clear, the behaviour of big oil producing countries with massive reserves will almost certainly change to ‘let’s pump as fast as we can while the going is good’ as it’ll be the rational economic thing to do. END

6414 2018-06-13 13:48:07 It was their money. Literally the Iran deal allows the Iranian’s the money they are owed for their oil sales that is being held by The US. The deal is they get their own money if they don’t develop nukes. Everyone with a clue agrees it’s a good deal & it is.

2 - There is no juice in an olive, that’s oil and they are soaked in brine. Stop asking for juice.

6453 2018-06-13 13:45:49 You have no idea how even the most basic things work have you? Do you not realise that your actions - particularly over Iran have caused oil prices to rise?. Exactly what your Ruskie friend, Putin, wants of course as most of the GDP in Russia is generated by oil.
6454 2018-06-13 13:45:45 YOU broke the deal with Iran, that has consequences and the whole world pays for your stupidity. You won't be getting any oil from Canada either since you've screwed that up too.
6455 2018-06-13 13:45:45 The US needs no foreign oil. We need do nothing in the Middle East with anyone except to monitor and act to stop wars that could cause world war.  The fights there are 5000 years old.

6476 2018-06-13 13:44:35 Of course, you don't realize that keeping the crude oil price low actually costs US jobs... or are you confusing crude oil price with retail gazoline price.

6492 2018-06-13 13:43:37 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS  Ending the Fed and the fake federal reserve, getting the US off the oil standard and back to gold, while ending big gov, will fix many problems!
6493 2018-06-13 13:43:14 This is unbelievable.... Just mesmerizing display of nature.
Plz tell me this is an oil painting  and not just a marvelous example of your digital photography !!! Thank you for sharing your work of art with us

6495 2018-06-13 13:43:00 So why do you promote Lukoil Gas Stations in Brooklyn?  Lukoil is the Russian owned Oil Company.  They should be barred from selling oil in the US. They are also the highest priced gasoline in my area of NJ.

6497 2018-06-13 13:42:54 We also need to keep in mind that the said period was a period of high fisc,  high oil prices.  Last 4yrs there is a oil bonanza.
6498 2018-06-13 13:42:45 New Mattress Update: Thought after the baking soda and the lavender oil, I could do it. Slept about 2 hours, couldn't deal. Ended up getting the best night of sleep in weeks on my old foam mattress pad on the floor. At least my dog enjoyed my side of the bed last night.

6505 2018-06-13 13:42:17 It's once again time for America to ramp up oil production.

6512 2018-06-13 13:41:52 You know, we could invest in green energy and maybe oil prices wouldn't be such an issue for you.  Of course, all your rich friends benefit more by you supporting dirty sources such as oil and coal.
6513 2018-06-13 13:41:51 Looking in the wrong place.  Refiners intentionally keeping runs low and products scarce.  Ask yourself why some refiners are making the same profits as when oil was >$100.
6514 2018-06-13 13:41:48 Y’all. I had an APPOINTMENT with God at @AllNationsMem last night, then heaven cracked open with crazy blessings this morning! There is POWER in praise that rips you out of your comfort zone.

6518 2018-06-13 13:41:12 I feel bad because he's not wrong about Bush's oil war allowing ISIS to gain traction. He is, however, really wrong about this idea that NK is going to denuclearize. But if it helps him sleep better... okay.

6532 2018-06-13 13:40:31 This aligns with the conservative insistence that good policy cannot be framed in ways that make it appeal to the common man, lest it be tainted with “”populism”. It must be sold as something painful but “good for you”. e.g. castor oil
6533 2018-06-13 13:40:26 We're committed to using only the most sustainable sources of palm oil in our products. We have removed it wherever possible and 100% of the palm oil used in M&S products is RSPO certified.

The market for oil is essentially controlled by OPEC. For your homework, research the OPEC oil embargo of 1973 and how it drove global oil

6584 2018-06-13 13:37:16 How "high" do you think oil prices should be? Was OPEC being "generous" when oil prices went from over $140 a barrel in 2008 to almost $30 a barrel in 2015?

(2) It's The Law of Supply and Demand that determines prices in the market.

Do any of the geniuses around Trump tell him that the US imports more oil from Canada than anywhere else? Maybe Ms. Freeland should speak in a language he understands "Thats a nice Energy System you have down there, be a shame if anything happened to it"

6588 2018-06-13 13:36:58 Demand for oil isn't going anywhere, anytime soon. And thanks to Chretiens' "clarity bill", the pathway to independence is clearly defined and lawful. Stay tuned.
6589 2018-06-13 13:36:45 Yeah well that’s why we need clean alternative energy systems to replace our need for oil.

6643 2018-06-13 13:32:24 Oil prices need to be around $75 or higher for U.S. oil companies to survive and grow. Prices lower than the current $60’s are harmful to long term U.S. growth thus oil sector employment.

6668 2018-06-13 13:30:38 Glad you're calling out OPEC for manipulating and raising oil prices, who is driven by Saudi Arabia. We need to divest from Saudi oil and Middle East We need independence,
6669 2018-06-13 13:30:32 Your continued removal of restrictions on the business of oil production must continue!  We can be energy self sufficient.  

Then let OPEC choke on their oil!!!

6672 2018-06-13 13:30:18 There is enough oil in Alaska and other parts of the US that could save Americans millions of dollars! But politicians have their hands in the pockets of the big oil companies so they would never allow off shore drilling to benefit the American people

6679 2018-06-13 13:29:55 This oil went up because of 45. It has been low for years. That tax cut is going to cause you to pay more for food, supplies, gas and healthcare. You won’t see a dime of that miniscule tax cut

6683 2018-06-13 13:29:36 The US getting 40% of our oil from Canada, you starting trade wars, alienating our alies while hailing our adisaries as 'honest' couldn't possibly have anything to do with this!

6691 2018-06-13 13:29:09 After loosing my sister with cancer and learning what the power of Hemp oil has just one of thousands of products we can make I totally believe and know Americans have a right to produce this crop. Why buy it from China and Europe when we can grow it! #GrowHemp#NoToGrassley
6692 2018-06-13 13:29:04 Your buddy Putin is happy as hell, you made the oil prices increase. Gas is too high because of you!
6693 2018-06-13 13:29:02 Donald Trump has for too long (70 years) been far too much an inconsistent, deceptive, and vindictive person, for anyone of even the slightest intellect to accept credibility in anything he says. He has been and is, a snake oil salesman, who holds no values but for himself.
6694 2018-06-13 13:28:51 Wonder if the high price of oil is a direct result of the resistance movement persuading OPEC to raise prices before the Midterm elections and blaming The GOP and Trump
6695 2018-06-13 13:28:51 So, first one must get the waves that are in the op. Brush your hair, water for curling, preferred oil/conditioner for moisturizing/conditioning, and more brushing. After it waves up, let it grow continuing to do the same thing until you have to switch to a comb for length.

6699 2018-06-13 13:28:36 Ever thought, fuckwit, that your action against Iran is the reason oil prices are going up?!!
6700 2018-06-13 13:28:28 They certainly have had practice in containing PMS over the course of half a century. Oil is no different it's all about manipulating this to their benefit till it no longer suits that end.
6701 2018-06-13 13:28:27 Yes, that’s referred to be an StS (Ship-to-Ship) transfer. The receiving vessel didn’t have permission to pick up that oil due to an embargo, so the customer chartered a tanker to meet up with one that was allowed.
6702 2018-06-13 13:28:23 Any idea why they banned the word “depression”-we need to talk about depression & have it highlighted given the increase we are all seeing. Unless the word serves as a trigger? As long as there are buyers there will be sellers of snake oil.
6703 2018-06-13 13:28:22 True! I read about plans to go ahead with drilling in the arctic right after this and got mad again. Zinke can't win now. His opponents aren't going to believe him and Trump fans will be upset if he turns to renewables instead of coil, oil & gas. No pity for him though!

Do have new Iran threat because you wanted to raise oil prices for Russia.

6730 2018-06-13 13:26:32 I was trying to think of a word, and I resorted to my oft used 'curious'. 

The m/t trend in $WTIC is clearly bullish, with 75/80 seemingly probable by late summer. Won't take much for the oil market to get spooked on 'higher growth concerns'.

6733 2018-06-13 13:26:25 Samboa: GOP did not fight the stopping of oil subsidies. They opposed the President from wanting to cut out tax deductions for oil companies. These companies spend millions drilling and many times, they come up dry. They used to be able to deduct these losses.
6734 2018-06-13 13:26:23 Right On!!! Oil prices must come down before it hurts our economy.

6738 2018-06-13 13:26:05 True they always have the system is fixed! Why do you think Ontario pays more for oil and gas?

6763 2018-06-13 13:24:16 High oil prices are your doing, #WorstPresidentEver
6764 2018-06-13 13:24:15 Don’t worry Mr @realDonaldTrump, you just need to put the price of your Arms higher. It seems majority of #OPEC Nations exchanges their oil with Arms anyway. Like #SaudiArabia will pay $110b Arms Trade you made with them by Oil, so why do you concerned?
6765 2018-06-13 13:24:11 Fair price its oil base price.But i know that  it's Big Game which some people play that way earn big ,astronomy money.Actually no one has know how prices raise or reduce,when in oceans swim fully oil tankers.

6770 2018-06-13 13:24:05 You're right. Hard to juggle stuff huh, Donny? I'm wondering how many of your family members, cronies & hanger on's have $$$ in oil? How about you? Release those tax returns so we can see how much you're making by using the office as a market place. #notmypresident #resist
6771 2018-06-13 13:24:03 I will sleep better when we remove Congress. You are a 70 something rasict, snake oil salesman. You won't change. Congress has the spine of a jellyfish. None...
6772 2018-06-13 13:24:01 Stop allowing export of US oil then? Keep it cheap for us, expensive for them?

6774 2018-06-13 13:23:57 This President must be the most uneducated ever. The price of oil is not set by individuals or even countries. Anyone who went to business school knows that there is a market value for commodities set by supply and demand. #ImpeachTrump

6778 2018-06-13 13:23:32 You are missing the bigger angle, impact on oil prices as Iranian volumes gets squeezed by Trump's withdrawal from nuclear agreements. 

Trump doesn't want that negative impact so preemptively asking Saudi /OPEC to start pumping more!
6779 2018-06-13 13:23:32 We need more of our own oil!!
6780 2018-06-13 13:23:31 Well last month he was working on peace and now he will work on your oil complaints.

6791 2018-06-13 13:22:48 Let's keep our oil flowing!
6792 2018-06-13 13:22:46 Mr “president”, you only wished you could take Iraq’s oil. Your dear General disagreed, that was not the primary mission of peace in the Middle East. #TheResistance
6793 2018-06-13 13:22:45 Trump said it to our face "I love the poorly educated."
He knew they would buy any snake oil he put in front of them
6794 2018-06-13 13:22:44 That’s because oil reserves are depleting and climate change (which is real, by the way) means we need to move away from burning fossil fuels.

If you’d spent more time reading books and paying attention to experts, you’d know all of this!
6795 2018-06-13 13:22:44 But you want high oil prices so that your Russian oil investment will pay off.
6796 2018-06-13 13:22:41 LESS THAN 10 MIN TO EQUITY OPEN. ES UNCH, OIL UNCH, 10Y YIELD FLAT, DXY DOWN. Yup it’s Fed day
6797 2018-06-13 13:22:32 Do any include CBD oil or Stem Cell Therapy?
6798 2018-06-13 13:22:32 OPEC, being a cartel, can control production/supply and therefore manipulate oil price per barrel. They have a long history of doing just that. Get yourself an education before you make such asinine comments.
6799 2018-06-13 13:22:31 70% + domestic production right ? U gave HUGE corporate tax breaks to our oil companies why are they so high? Wipes out any gains this is pushing the CPI up!

6801 2018-06-13 13:22:31 Good to know oil prices are increasing other than in my country (India)
6802 2018-06-13 13:22:22 A President has literally no power over oil prices. Unless Trump is going to force American oil companies to produce more, flood the market, and eliminate their profit margins, this is all just postering - as usual.
6803 2018-06-13 13:22:21 What a piece of work you are Donald! YOU ARE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THAT! Reimposed Iran sanctions took oil off market ergo prices went up. Obviously missed that Wharton Econ class! Also fuels US energy self sufficiency! CLUELESS INCONSISTENCIES - SAD  @AC360 @donlemon @PressSec
6804 2018-06-13 13:22:20 We as I species have to keep the oil in the ground for #climatechange reasons. Oil shouldn't be a factor in any independence decision as Scotland needs to find other sources of income anyway. @NicolaSturgeon knows this.

6806 2018-06-13 13:22:16 I'm from the UK so don't get CNN. Just have a healthy interest in global affairs. This is what happens when you pull out of a deal with a country that provides oil. The US walked back on this and Iran were abiding by the rules. But yeah your memes have real gravitas (look it up)
6807 2018-06-13 13:22:08 Build the wall! Canada will pay for it. And we’ll dig it so deep it will cut right through that oil pipeline that sends you our oil

6810 2018-06-13 13:21:54 Mr. President,
Drum some senses in this cartel.
They want to ruin the fragile world economy.
They don't care about jobs for the millions.
They delight in unemployment of our youth for easy recruitment by terror groups 
Get those US oil rigs to work. Flood the market. Tame them.
6811 2018-06-13 13:21:49 Who has oil....Thats right Canada lmao.
6812 2018-06-13 13:21:46 Only 44% of small businesses have claimed their Google My Business listing. 

That’s why so many snake oil companies acting like they’re Google try to get biz owner’s to pay and claim a listing that is free. 

Needs to stop!
6813 2018-06-13 13:21:31 ..well, that is because you decided they were your FRIENDS.  Now, that you and Canada are at war, OPEC tells us what to do.  LONG ago, smarter presidents were actively eliminating the NEED for oil... but nOOOooooOOoo  you love the stuff. They will screw us. That is how they run.

Now We Should Shift focus To OPEC As to WHY Prices Are So High!!
6828 2018-06-13 13:20:32 All a nigga would do is take it to the dealership for me...it ain’t like too many niggas know how to change the oil, rotate tires or change the a/c filter
6829 2018-06-13 13:20:29 Sorry, but oil prices are up because you backed out of the Iran Deal. We are all going to have to pay for your impulsive moves. BAD!
6830 2018-06-13 13:20:24 @realDonaldTrump blame @exxonmobil @Shell @BP_America @Chevron @conocophillips etc for exporting cheap fracked oil from US to import expensive oil from abroad! No different to multinationals who shelter profits abroad and don't pay taxes! #WeThePeople aren't stupid!
6831 2018-06-13 13:20:22 The US is the largest exporter of US oil right now. Opec is close to irrelevancy and suggest @POTUS utilize national security rights to redirect more US Oil to remain at home. Price per Barrel is rigged and propped up. Either more US output or Tesla/Volt here we come.
6832 2018-06-13 13:20:21 When I turn on the news in the morning and see "Trump declares North Korea No Longer a Nuclear Threat", it's clear that we still have an idiot in @WhiteHouse. This country deserves better than a snake oil salesman for @POTUS! #CNN #ConMan @GOP @realDonaldTrump
6833 2018-06-13 13:20:15 @realDonaldTrump Everybody knows WHY USA is selling our Refined products from oil to other countries. To help compensate for the huge TRADE DEFICIT.  It's a no brainer. 800 Billion in the hole & you give away our gasoline & diesel fuel. USA has 40 yrs oil supply left >2034 GONE.
6834 2018-06-13 13:20:13 As usual you blame other people for your stupidity.  Oil prices are higher because you pulled out of the Iran Deal.  Hey, Donald, we're tired of winning already!  Please stop!
6835 2018-06-13 13:20:12 The collapse in oil price is a negative for @theSNP. But there's an upside. #Brexit may be so damaging Scots could vote for independence as an escape route. Too soon to tell how the 2 factors will play out. #EU is also in big trouble, and Scotland would have to take the #Euro....
6836 2018-06-13 13:20:08 Washington contacts think 2019 RVO this week will be favorable to Biodiesel/advanced biofuel and will  make up for refiner exemptions.  D4 rins Trying to rally.  Bean Oil bottom?  Trump looking to throw a bone to the ag lobby.

6842 2018-06-13 13:19:40 So government oil companies start growing their own oil refinery on gasoline and sell it to me at cost
6843 2018-06-13 13:19:39 No.  The folks who don’t believe in climate change are not amenable to reason.  Especially when they are shills or tools of the oil industry.

6849 2018-06-13 13:19:09 As much as I hate government interference I believe government should start growing their own oil wells refine their own gasoline and selling it to me at cost which would be about a dollar a gallon probably $0.70 a gallon it probably cost less than $0.50 a gallon to make gasoline

6852 2018-06-13 13:18:59 This is your fault. Oil prices went down under Pres. Obama. Your fault.
6853 2018-06-13 13:18:42 185. Definitely a boost in productivity 

On days off, the PMO-addicted me would do nothing at all. Yesterday, I decided I needed an oil change and drove 1.5 hours one-way to the only place that I could get it. Normally I swear I wouldnt have been able.I also did laundry and yoga
6854 2018-06-13 13:18:42 What we didnt do wad admit wrong doing claiming we were having war games off NK coast being the ones provocating War. Nor did we ever promise to reduce our capability and reaction in that area in the same breath. We did however get oil

6856 2018-06-13 13:18:32 Then stop buying from OPEC. Use  oil!
6857 2018-06-13 13:18:31 You realize that Trump pulling out of the Iran deal pushes oil prices higher which Saudi Arabia wants. It’s this funny thing called Aramco IPO. They want barrels to go above $100/barrel. Facts matter pumpkin
6858 2018-06-13 13:18:28 High oil prices were the reason Carter lost Presidency as much anything else. 
All Just A Little Bit Of History Repeating
6859 2018-06-13 13:18:25 You have been calling for American oil independence and they decided to show you what happens when you don't have OPEC around. 
Now that prices are going up, US companies can get back to oil production. Further polluting the US and driving costs even higher.
6860 2018-06-13 13:18:24 You get most of your oil from Canada. Hmmm... maybe our “weak and pathetic” prime minister could do something to fix that for you.
6861 2018-06-13 13:18:23 Careful a lot of that oil is refined in the United States and then sent back
6862 2018-06-13 13:18:20 It’s open today. Going after oil is a wartime strategy
6863 2018-06-13 13:18:14 60% of our imported oil comes from canada, we have larger reserves in the us but buy from canada to help their economy. Ever hear of alaska, texas, n. Dakota? We dont have to buy foreign oil but its in the us and the worlds better interest that we do.
6864 2018-06-13 13:18:11 最高すぎん…？
6865 2018-06-13 13:18:08 If you want oil prices down open up North and South Dakota oil wells that are sitting idle because of the greedy oil companies are not happy with $60 a barrel. It's called good old-fashioned greed $60 a barrel is not enough for these people they want 80 they want a hundred
6866 2018-06-13 13:17:55 The oil prices started spiking as soon as you backed out of the Iran agreement you twit.
6867 2018-06-13 13:17:49 The first reason I got cold feet over independence was the fall in the oil price. Until it rises dramatically the economic basis has declined catastrophically. @theSNP rely on most independence voters not being economically literate. Not a great plan, imho. #JC4PM #StopToryBrexit
6868 2018-06-13 13:17:48 Funny how people on here are calling for regime change, history please that is how Iran what it is today UK & US failed regime change. How about we just stop trying to own all the oil

6872 2018-06-13 13:17:41 Its your fault with your economic policies & pulling out of the Iran deal. You're responsible as you're the President & it now lands on your shoulders. Another recession will follow since oil prices affect everything. Mad President Trump as in crazy like Mad King George.

6877 2018-06-13 13:17:11 Donald never calculates the costs of pollution & greenhouse gas emissions when he gripes about high oil prices. If he did, oil prices would cost around $20 per gallon at the gas pump.
6878 2018-06-13 13:17:10 Oil price is your fault!
6879 2018-06-13 13:17:04 If you get Brent Crude Oil prices to drop, I'll be impressed. Something I never felt I'd say, feel or mention with you in mind
6880 2018-06-13 13:17:03 Special financial support of ALTERNATIVES to oil / gas would be helpful. As an obvious byproduct create jobst and there would be less war on oil / gas.

6881 2018-06-13 13:16:55 it isnt good and price too high with all the oil out there gas could be a 1.50 and they all would still make tons of money
6882 2018-06-13 13:16:53 Need to get more oil from shale and tar sands on line, as well as more LNG tankers for France and Germany to cut EU obnoxious trade surplus.

6886 2018-06-13 13:16:33 You should be cuz prices are going up cuz the dotard got out of the Iran deal and with it gave up 500,000 barrels of Iranian oil for worldwide consumption.
6887 2018-06-13 13:16:31 Hey Dumbass!  This isn't the 70's.  America is the highest producer of oil now! Maybe our oil companies see that you since you lowered mileage requirements and are killing alternative fuel options, they can just raise prices as high as the 70's again!
6888 2018-06-13 13:16:29 That assumes he knows he’s selling snake oil, vs. just saying what he wants to believe is true.

6893 2018-06-13 13:16:06 Love it, this is a genocide on Yemen to steal their oil.
Unbelievable no coverage in the BBC or CNN regarding its evil backers. Regardless I'm for the underdog.
6894 2018-06-13 13:16:00 So fix it. You said Obama should resign when oil prices went up. #Resign #WorstPresidentEver
6895 2018-06-13 13:16:00 Coal & oil isn't "non renewable" things are constantly dying on Earth and everyday new oils form all the time. WE were supposed to run out of oil in 2000! Now the truth comes out that America has more oil under its soil than Saudi Arabia!
6896 2018-06-13 13:15:52 @ProfOsinbajo sir oil price has been high for 3months now when will the price of petrol drop?
6897 2018-06-13 13:15:44 Good for me that works on the oil field
6898 2018-06-13 13:15:44 Wait, I thought we were energy independent and we export more oil than we use. Please correct me if I’m wrong.
6899 2018-06-13 13:15:39 So I can make you crude oil soup or get a bathtub full of it ready for you.... Or would you rather eat a fucking pair. Y'all trying to make this make sense and not see the obviously insane oversimplification are just that. Insane and simple.
6900 2018-06-13 13:15:36 We get a little extra money and the oil companies want it. They should do like other companies and share the extras they are getting from better regulators with us
6901 2018-06-13 13:15:32 Are oil prices in your U.S. higher than those in China? You can consult your friend, President Xi, for the truth.
6902 2018-06-13 13:15:29 Check your Engine oil this Sunday.
6903 2018-06-13 13:15:27 Oil prices have been rising for the last 2 or 3 years. It has nothing to do with the Iran deal. We do not get oil from Iran. It is all greed it is all good old-fashioned greed. These people aren't happy with 500 million dollars a day Prophet they want 700 million a day Prophet
6904 2018-06-13 13:15:26 If POTUSs don't affect oil prices, why is it that oil prices rise during a Republican administration and lower under a Democrat??
6905 2018-06-13 13:15:25 He knows but his answer is we will have to buy...yep you guessed it, Russian oil for lower prices.  Not that much lower though.
6906 2018-06-13 13:15:21 Someone took 500,000 barrels of Iranian oil a week off the world market.
Who was that, #Spanky? Oh, right....
6907 2018-06-13 13:15:19 Frack baby, Frack!  Calif has oil shales offshore that they refuse to let be developed.  I think lots of it is in federal waters.  Ca stopped most all oil dev about 45 yrs ago when there was an oil spill on beach.  Not as bad as the sewage they spew into ocean, but----

6913 2018-06-13 13:14:56 How do you drive at “fair” price?   Isn’t the fair price what the market sets?   Or are you suggesting that oil price be more heavily subsidized?   Maybe we should invade another country, spend another trillion dollars on a war of choice?

6920 2018-06-13 13:14:22 If oil prices drop, plenty of US oil companies will go bankrupt, not to mention thousands of oil workers will be unemployed ...are you trying to put US oil workers out of work again with such tweets??? US oil companies need at least $75 per barrel price to survive!

6925 2018-06-13 13:14:04 Can you imagine Bush sending out a tweet saying oil prices are too high, OPEC is at it again. I never really before what pussies they were until Trump. No wonder they hate him.
6926 2018-06-13 13:13:55 Does opec still set the amount of oil released per day from their reserve?

6935 2018-06-13 13:13:14 Let OPEC jack up prices. Let American workers get it done. When we needed them, the American oil industry rose to the challenge. They innovated and showed us true American exceptionalism. Time to repay the favor. Let's open up better areas for oil and gas right here in the USA.
6936 2018-06-13 13:13:10 Don't  trump's Russian oligarch buddies who make so much $ from oil through Rosneft like higher oil prices?  I find it hard to believe trump would do anything to lower prices. That might anger Putin.
6937 2018-06-13 13:13:09 Supply and demand. Do something to lessen our dependence on oil. Invest in alternative fuel

6947 2018-06-13 13:12:38 Well, Well... how about that: for more than 40 years, Washington, DC has ruled the global monetary roost by propping up Middle East dictators in exchange for those dictators pricing their Crude Oil in USDs. That system is coming to an end..the Petro Yuan is here.

6951 2018-06-13 13:12:29 I agree, but with U.S. oil production setting records why do we even care?
6952 2018-06-13 13:12:25 On the other hand mismanagement, currency controls, speculation and inflation are also some reasons why this socialist government fails every time oil isn't profitable.

6960 2018-06-13 13:12:07 ACTUALLY the reason oil prices are so high is that you violated the Iran agreement limiting oil suppliers.

6981 2018-06-13 13:10:25 Okay. Trump's solved the North Korean crisis (but they still have nukes). Time to solve the price of oil with Saudi Arabia. What happened to that peace treaty that Jared was going to make with Israel and Palestine?

6999 2018-06-13 13:09:21 1 has nothing to do with the other snowflake.  Oil prices are set by OPEC not iran.  OPEC forced the price down so American companies could not extract our own oil. Economics honey.
7000 2018-06-13 13:09:21 Yes. I wonder who imposed sanctions on Iran. A country whose main export, last I checked, was OIL.

7026 2018-06-13 13:07:51 It’s so nice to you to have noticed that oil prices are too high finally the Arabs have to deal with a negotiator how low can the prices come down now can we see gas under a dollar again anything is possible with you Donald get it done Welcome back home
7027 2018-06-13 13:07:49 I want some CBD rub-on oil and maybe a CBD bath bomb. #cbd
7028 2018-06-13 13:07:44 Well, you knew oil prices were going to rise once you pulled out of the Iran Deal. You were warned by plenty of this result. It made Russia very happy, wasn't that your intent. Anything for pal Putin. Part of Your betrayal of America, in favor of Russia.

7030 2018-06-13 13:07:38 Why are you complaining?  You have stock in oil. #idiotinchief
7031 2018-06-13 13:07:31 OPEC may be a driver, but US oil follows OPEC instead of independent pricing.  Even if US BIG oil can produce for cheaper, they still go with OPEC Pricing.  better stance is GREED.

7036 2018-06-13 13:07:26 If #Russia and #SaudiArabia increase oil production next week, Trump is likely to view it as proof that close relations with the two can have transactional benefits, while #EU, #Japan, #Canada, etc do not have the same benefits.
7037 2018-06-13 13:07:23 I don’t think paper can handle oil paints, but you can try it and see how it goes!
7038 2018-06-13 13:07:18 Duh, OPEC is an oil cartel. A cartel does what it can to control both supply and price. Is there no adult in the @WhiteHouse ? Mike Pence may never be seen again - he is so far up Trump's ass he'll never find a way out.
7039 2018-06-13 13:07:18 “Add water to oil” what mess? You trying to burn people skin up?!?

7041 2018-06-13 13:07:15 We continue to be be assaulted by the Art of the Lie. US gets played by NK and snake oil POTUS declares victory. His “enemy of the people” must work to save Democracy. Journalist John Walcott once said: When the govt. says something, you have only one question to ask, IS IT TRUE.
7042 2018-06-13 13:07:14 The more I read about #DonTheCon and Kim Jong Undies meeting the more it sounds like total  only question who came out on top, the snake oil salesman, or the guy with the  haircut?
7043 2018-06-13 13:07:07 The cancellation of the Iran deal & moving the embassy to Jerusalem both caused increased tensions throughout the Middle East which led to increases in oil prices. His actions have consequences.
7044 2018-06-13 13:07:07 In all honesty u should be thanking OPEC for saving some of the debt laden US producers. The $ of oil needs to be at a certain level. Otherwise production slows and jobs lost. I am certain the higher oil prices have significantly helped your jobs reports.
7045 2018-06-13 13:07:02 The relish you put in siomai, charot. Chili oil haha
7046 2018-06-13 13:07:01 President Obama did a GREAT JOB of lowering crude oil prices. He steadily lowered my gasoline down to a low of $1.59 a gallon in December 2016.
Once you took over, it has now steadily increased until it is presently $3.25 a gallon!
7047 2018-06-13 13:06:57 1) if you hadn't messed with the Iran deal we wouldn't be missing the oil they contribute to supply.
2) I thought the Saudis were your best friends. Why don't you just get them to lower the prices?
7048 2018-06-13 13:06:57 So I finally opened the homemade chili oil that I was neglecting to try... Turns out it was really, really good :(
7049 2018-06-13 13:06:51 try efficascent oil!!!!!
7050 2018-06-13 13:06:51 Oil prices are up because you pulled out of the Iran nuclear agreement. You own this.
7051 2018-06-13 13:06:49 Since my 67 cents a week tax break is going to cover my fuel this makes the oil companies the big winner as they are getting their huge tax break and mine as well.

7057 2018-06-13 13:06:29 Let's see if I can dumb this down for you. They have the oil, they set the price. By the way how much was one of those Trump Steaks?
7058 2018-06-13 13:06:25 Oil is about to go down !!!  LOL !
7059 2018-06-13 13:06:24 Oil prices destroyed the economy during the Bush term. Who is fueling this price increase? #deepstate?
7060 2018-06-13 13:06:08 Oil price from $46 to $150 in 2 years?
Who is running world econony?
How the poor will survive?
7061 2018-06-13 13:05:56 Putin sells oil.  This is rigged for him.
7062 2018-06-13 13:05:53 Without “Big oil” there would be no pharmaceuticals or petrochemicals. We would be forced to burn more coal to meet power demands.
7063 2018-06-13 13:05:46 I think he needs to grow up abit instead of throwing his toys out the pram when he people don’t agree with his farcical theories....
7064 2018-06-13 13:05:44 We're committed to using only the most sustainable sources of palm oil in our products. We have removed it wherever possible and 100% of the palm oil used in M&S products is RSPO certified.
7065 2018-06-13 13:05:43 You need oil. You have proven through your policies that you aren’t interested in switching to renewable energy. We are still way under the price per barrel that we saw during the Bush era when you guys were buying Hummers and Escalades. How would it hurt our bank accounts?

7067 2018-06-13 13:05:40 Here we go again.  Maybe you should talk to the Koch brothers before you complain about high oil prices.  They love it and they support your party.
7068 2018-06-13 13:05:39 OK. Add the oil economy to the mountain of data about which Our Ignoramus doesn't doesn't have a clue.
7069 2018-06-13 13:05:39 Finally nailed octopus: sous vide 5h @ 75C, drain (and save) liquid, brush with smoked oil, grill over very hot coals about 5 minutes. Tender but toothsome, with slight crunchy exterior.
7070 2018-06-13 13:05:31 You are responsible, not OPEC!  If we are the biggest Oil Producer, why can’t we provide Americans cheaper oil!
7071 2018-06-13 13:05:31 Yes, $TSLA essentially is an energy company and a competitor to oil. At this time, global energy demand is insatiable, so all energy providers are positively correlated. If Tesla ever grows quicker than global energy demand, then traditional energy sources will lose market share.
7072 2018-06-13 13:05:24 You have the audacity to talk about oil prices after your actions?
7073 2018-06-13 13:05:23 soooo i’m getting my oil changed and the guy I talked to was like a little rude and I jokingly texted my mom and said that, and SHE CALLED UO HERE WHILE IM LITERALLY STILL IN THE SAME ROOM WITH HIM AND CHEWED HIM OUT

7077 2018-06-13 13:05:08 Oil prices are high due to uncertainty in supply, in large part because of reimposing sanctions on Iran.  Surely you can't really be so stupid, right?  It's just an act?  Right?
7078 2018-06-13 13:04:52 Oh sweet Jesus ! Will you fucking well shut up. You just effectively re-sanctioned a major oil producer. It's not fucking rocket science, it's called cause an effect. No, not course and affect.........cause and effect. Got it ?
7079 2018-06-13 13:04:50 And I suppose Trump's supporters didn't notice that the huge jump in oil prices came right after Trump pulled us out of the Iran Peace Deal.
7080 2018-06-13 13:04:46 No shit... I wonder if taking Iran out of the oil market actually has something to do w this

7083 2018-06-13 13:04:40 No,it is not a good tendency for OPEC to decide the price
of oil arbitrarily.
7084 2018-06-13 13:04:40 Haven't sip no oil in a min shit got the best off me last night

7088 2018-06-13 13:04:20 I know the economy is good but something need to be done about oil prices

7104 2018-06-13 13:03:23 Oil prices are too low... gasoline prices are too high. If gas drops too low per mcf or oil drops too low per bbl, it will not be economical to produce.
7105 2018-06-13 13:03:17 No don't you dare blame OPEC. The reason oil is high is your cancellations of the Iranian deal making Iranian oil unusable by the largest economy on the planet making what supplies are available more expensive. Higher prices are your fault.
7106 2018-06-13 13:03:14 Wow. I'm just appalled. "Take-out" means what exactly. I protest strongly. These war hawks make me sick. What reasons do you give for these 7 wars? Are you insane. Are we freaking attacking for land, oil,  what.We must stop this kind of talk.

7113 2018-06-13 13:02:42 Fish oil was the recommendation, but I’m vegan so I refused.  I had to take a seaweed pill instead. Awful. BUT it kept me from ever having to take a cholesterol medicine for life.
7114 2018-06-13 13:02:35 From npr: "The market perceives that Saudi Arabia and Russia are having a strong  and fruitful collaboration to keep the price of oil high and rising,"  said Amy Myers Jaffe, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign  Relations. Your pal, Putin, has something to do with it.
7115 2018-06-13 13:02:33 The worries over new Iran sanctions lifting oil is all Trump fault. He's a moron.

7122 2018-06-13 13:02:12 Hey dumb dumb sit down before you hurt yourself. OPEC jacks up the price of oil anytime there is political unrest. Do you happen to know of any in particular scenarios right now in the world that are causing political unrest?

7129 2018-06-13 13:01:57 Agree with Pierre. Global energy demand is growing rapidly and quicker than forecasted. High oil prices are not OPEC's doing, but a result of years of underinvestment. Alternative energy generation will take a few years to develop sufficiently, and until then, we have a crisis.
7130 2018-06-13 13:01:57 All these NATO uprisings where complete and utter bull crap. Another way to expand the slave auctions, organ trafficking and heroin trade. Lets not forget about the oil. Weapons for heroin, so we can focus on revolutions in 1st world countries now. Its BS! ELITEs hate humanity.
7131 2018-06-13 13:01:51 Your withdrawing from JCPOA didn't help the price of oil, did it? When you make irresponsible decisions, you get some nasty consequences!

7137 2018-06-13 13:01:28 Sir, higher prices will drive down costlier US production! Any chance you can delete that tweet? It will also put a hurting on tar sands oil production in our sworn enemy -- Canada! There is a method to your madness, isn't there?

7149 2018-06-13 13:01:11 PLEASE... PLEASE.... Open Alaska for drilling and set us free of foreign oil
7150 2018-06-13 13:01:06 Agreed. If OPEC doesn't get their act together & other elements responsible for higher oil and gas prices, then we should release those alternative sources of energy known  & the secret free energy sources we have. They're entitled to a profit but not price gouging profiteering !
7151 2018-06-13 13:01:01 We get 40% of our oil from ....CANADA! jack
7152 2018-06-13 13:00:52 That's not a plan.  That's ignoring reality in order to support an ideology.  If we stop prodicing oil, maybe well use all renewables, who knows?  Willing to support that plan, too?
7153 2018-06-13 13:00:49 So I reduced mine from 200 overall to 170 in 3-6 months. CoQ10 with red yeast rice and niacin. Fish oil (or spirulina) and one other one. Let me find pic. The CoQ10 is the essential one. Upshot. It makes you feel warmer than normal.

7156 2018-06-13 13:00:44 Surely high oil prices are in the Saudi’s interest for the Aramco float!!!  There is little wonder it has been delayed while prices were lower.  I’m sure you know hat though!

7158 2018-06-13 13:00:31 Oil prices always go up in the summer.  That's how states get their taxes.  Duh...
7159 2018-06-13 13:00:24 Is Cadet Bone Spurs going to admit that oil prices went up the moment he pulled out of Iran deal? Gas prices are totally on his orange ass
7160 2018-06-13 13:00:22 Too stupid to realize that oil is a major export of the US? So high oil prices actually help his trade balance?
7161 2018-06-13 13:00:19 You purposefully started a trade war to hike up the oil prices so digging coal and creating more jobs idea would take off. Oil, before this, cost less than coal. Conniving,  narcissistic, freak.

7165 2018-06-13 13:00:12 Yes Sir, around $100 to fill my Chevy Silverado. That's 26 gallons and it's only good for about 350 miles. No good. Close to 2 bucks a gallon was nice years ago. I believe if crude is under $55 a barrel the oil guys don't make money.

7169 2018-06-13 12:59:53 Bit of a joke. Mexico 3rd time; USA 2nd time rather than a new bid from a proper football country. If only Morocco had lots of oil and slush money.

7172 2018-06-13 12:59:44 Do you realize we get 40% of our oil from Canada?  Your trade war is going to drive those prices up even more. You need to be working on a good deal with Canada.
7173 2018-06-13 12:59:44 I have like 70 things to do but I keep forgetting them and it’s like juggling slick bars of soap or glass balls that someone has coated in oil, possibly for sex reasons
7174 2018-06-13 12:59:43 Seems they always do that in the summer months.  We use more oil..  
7175 2018-06-13 12:59:43 You helped oil prices go up by pulling out of Iran deal.
7176 2018-06-13 12:59:31 Well then how can it be OPEC’s fault if oil prices are high in the US? Maybe because the oil companies can make more selling it internationally?
7177 2018-06-13 12:59:20 ひおきさんの熱意！
7178 2018-06-13 12:59:18 @WhiteHouse @PressSec 3) IMO #OPEC deciding to cut Oil supplies to lift barrel to $100 level is the real threat for all Consumers,Workers, Industry. 4) ATT+TW Monopoly & Comcast-NBC-Fox-SKY monopoly will destroy Web+Net Video+ISP new businesses for Youth entrepreneurs, shame !
7179 2018-06-13 12:59:17 We make enough #Oil to name the price why don't you personally send a team to take care of it or invoke the intimate domain rule or does that only apply to the little guy #gas pricing effects the cost of everything until hopefully @elonmusk starts to effect it
7180 2018-06-13 12:59:10 im not arguing about the oil prices going up, but im not sure if the US pulling out of the iran deal did do much in the region, the other nations seem to be keeping it intact even without the US

7191 2018-06-13 12:58:32 Yes that is why we need to produce more oil in United States  Sarah Palin was right drill baby drill
7192 2018-06-13 12:58:30 Putin needs oil prices to rise.  And Trump complied.  He's full of it.
7193 2018-06-13 12:58:29 It goes bang! The oil will cause the latex to disintegrate. It works best if you have a small balloon-sized inflated condom. It’s an effective visual demo of how the wrong type of lubricant will prevent a condom being an effective barrier! :)
7194 2018-06-13 12:58:11 aren't high oil prices good for his Putin  puppet master?
7195 2018-06-13 12:58:07 いっぱいちゅき
7196 2018-06-13 12:58:01 Where are you getting all this crude to open up your refineries? You get 60% of your oil from Canada and your president just pissed off the whole country of Canada. Trump successfully unified all five of Canada’s political parties against him.
7197 2018-06-13 12:57:54 According to Business Insider the US is set to become the worlder’s largest exporter of oil this year. More Trump lies

7200 2018-06-13 12:57:50 Just a reminder: Russia (even as not a member of OPEC) is one of the states which profit considerably from high oil prizes!
7201 2018-06-13 12:57:37 Trump admitted yesterday that he would find an excuse to cover up for something that he was wrong about and here is an example of that in real time. Oil prices are up due to his ill informed decision to pull out of the Iran deal.
7202 2018-06-13 12:57:34 Jesus you made sense! Talk to father Putin. Now that you’ve handed the PAC Rim to our enemies he might allow the oil to flow. Or you could stop treating Canada like shit and buy more of their oil.
7203 2018-06-13 12:57:34 No, i like waffles. I dont make pancakes. But ppl use it in the pan, never saw anyone use oil
7204 2018-06-13 12:57:19 뭐지 슬럼프 왔나..
7205 2018-06-13 12:57:19 But, if you want energy independence, high oil prices are good, because they will drive more drilling in the USA.
7206 2018-06-13 12:57:12 backing out of the Iran deal is what raised oil prices. #themoreyouknow
7207 2018-06-13 12:57:10 Oil is high because you make it high you control OPEC and make money with oil being high you are the worst somebody arrest Trump he is ruining America I want Hillary to be president!!!!!’  #impeach45 #resist #theresistance

7211 2018-06-13 12:56:49 Aren’t you the world’s greatest deal maker go negotiate a reduction in oil prices. What happened to the oil surpluses you inherited from the Obama era? Since you took office gas prices have gone up about $0.50 a gallon for regular.
7212 2018-06-13 12:56:39 It is not clear, I work in the plastics industry and you're making 0 sense like most of the population. If you're talking about cracking of crude oil and how you want it to stop - you'd better kiss your phone, your car, your house goodbye.

7214 2018-06-13 12:56:37 Car manufactures and oil companies conspiracy, car sales way down, tons of inventory sitting on dealer lots, raise price of gas/oil so it’s too expensive for the popular trucks and SUVs,  increase in car buying follows, it’s a put on.
7215 2018-06-13 12:56:35 When u are given an oil bloc?
7216 2018-06-13 12:56:29 After he scrap Iran deal oil prices went up never went down, the guy lies about everything, media needs to start doing their job
7217 2018-06-13 12:56:25 How would you.know? They have managed to funnel money to the anti fracking movement to further their oil exports.
7218 2018-06-13 12:56:25 Not to worry.  High oil/gas prices will incentivized US domestic oil/gas producers to drill baby, drill, and bring forth more supply which will ease prices.
7219 2018-06-13 12:56:23 Time for you to refine some of the beautiful oil here in #Oregon #oil #refine
7220 2018-06-13 12:56:23 No, it’s your rich oil friends!
7221 2018-06-13 12:56:20 because you no longer have access to the 500,000 barrels of oil from Iran after pulling out of the deal. Its economics not OPEC.
7222 2018-06-13 12:56:13 Trump abandons the Iran deal and Putin picks up incremental oil business. Trump makes a terrible deal with Kim which strengthens China.

Bye bye Britain.
7224 2018-06-13 12:56:02 Oil prices are high because you backed out of the Iranian deal. This is your fault. You own this whether you like it or not.
7225 2018-06-13 12:56:01 Dear President, many many American need a good oil price in order to support their family!  I live in Russell Kansas, and when oil here is in the tank, so is the local economy, which is normal for oil communities!  Leave the oil alone!
7226 2018-06-13 12:55:50 All the same these oil rich muslim country's we have only spent 3.6 trillion dollers  on the war in iraq and Afghanistan they these cheeky bastards then charge us the earth for oil  and yet we didnt take one barrle or oil from Iraq its obama madness from mark

7228 2018-06-13 12:55:38 gas oil prices fools ila make you
7229 2018-06-13 12:55:33 Of course oil prices are high, it's summer. The time where families are going on road trips, you have to take advantage of them somehow. We also aren't trying to use Saudi Arabia to destroy a socialist country with oil as their main export right now.
7230 2018-06-13 12:55:29 JUST IN: The President of the United States assert that "oil prices are too high," evidently concerned that market forces will result in not enough carbon being added to the earth's atmosphere.
7231 2018-06-13 12:55:28 Interesting alliances emerging here. Israel, Russia, China, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Philippines. All led by authoritarians/dictators/corrupt are praising Chump. Why?  What's the end game/goal for the balance of power in the world? Oligarchs and dictators? 
Human rights or oil rights?
7232 2018-06-13 12:55:25 "Oil prices are too high, OPEC is at it again. Not good!" President Trump says in a morning poem.
7233 2018-06-13 12:55:25 Don’t you think sanctions on Iranian oil has anything to do with that? You are the dumbest businessman on the planet.
7234 2018-06-13 12:55:21 Yeah @JoeBudden Will out here looking sharp on the gram.... all smoke not good smoke!! Hate for you to get your oil change by the fresh Prince

7236 2018-06-13 12:55:19 Wow, now it's OPEC! Perhaps you should just import lots of oil and just not pay for it. Just say it is of substandard quality - I'm sure you'll think of something.  After all, you are the man, the one who single handedly solves the world's problems. Go get em Donald!

7238 2018-06-13 12:55:10 Put bio oil on it, I have a scar on my arm from that happening to me years ago 
7239 2018-06-13 12:55:09 Higher oil prices will actually help American companies and workers stay in business. On the other hand, lower oil prices will help emerging economies get cranking & steal American jobs & power.
7240 2018-06-13 12:55:09 realDonaldTrump tweeted - Oil prices are too high, OPEC is at it again. Not good!
7241 2018-06-13 12:54:56 OPEC? You shut down half a million barrels of production from Iran. Yet again, Russia wins via their oil exports.
Yes MAGAts, your $1/wk gain from the #TaxScam is eaten up by 1 gallon of gas and it's all on Trump.

7248 2018-06-13 12:54:23 Not that much of our oil (<10%) comes from OPEC anymore; price spike has more to do with increasing demand from less lethargic economy, start of summer travel season, and other, non-production factors.
7249 2018-06-13 12:54:16 Peter fine, Adrian is off his head and needs therapy.
7250 2018-06-13 12:54:05 You’re too smart to not realize that Iran deal ending is a rounding error to oil market. Stick with the facts
7251 2018-06-13 12:54:04 Oil prices being high was always Obama’s fault. Now they’re OPEC’s? I get it.
7252 2018-06-13 12:54:02 Man!
If only we had some sort of, I dunno...alternative energy we could use so we wouldn’t be so dependent on oil.

7273 2018-06-13 12:52:45 Thank you, @BarakObama. The $5+ we saved when we filled up each time at the pump allowed us to invest in our country's recovering economy.

Now its back to the Republicans, w/ their price gouging & lies abt the need for coastal oil drilling. Except, of course, at Mar-A-Lago.
7274 2018-06-13 12:52:44 This is the man  (trump) that attacked Canada's tariffs. He doesn't know what he's talking about, ignorant. Our lumber, dairy , oil,electricity on and on we trade with Canada. Canada trade with us at their loss $332, billion, we make $342,billion.  It will cost the middle class.
7275 2018-06-13 12:52:41 Wonder how high the price of gas is going to get? Wonder if the Canadians will slap new "tariffs" (just negotiating tool) on their oil?
7276 2018-06-13 12:52:36 interesting for sure.
7277 2018-06-13 12:52:34 I actually read opecs website. They update information on whats affecting oil prices, but im just a dumb trucker.
7278 2018-06-13 12:52:34 Oil prices went down because we had a deal with Iran, but you screwed that up pretty good.

7280 2018-06-13 12:52:08 Well, you get a large chunk of your oil from us here in Canada but @realDonaldTrump seems to not like us any more. I’m sure we won’t gleefully slow the flow and watch the price go up since we’re so “meek” and “weak” and all.

7283 2018-06-13 12:52:03 What you're saying here is that you don't understand what OPEC does and how global oil prices work,mister 'Not Good'.
7284 2018-06-13 12:51:57 Then do something about it.  Shit, I forgot that you aren't allowed to take action against price gouging, like with prescription, oil, steel, you know, things you personally profit from.
7285 2018-06-13 12:51:55 Don't forget the oil workers who support you.

7288 2018-06-13 12:51:39 OPEC = your friends in Saudi Arabia and UAE who colluded with you in election and convinced you to back out of Iran deal. Oil prices are up because you are their puppet when you're not busy being Putin's puppet.
7289 2018-06-13 12:51:37 Heid that's rather pathetic of them isn't it!
7290 2018-06-13 12:51:37 The law of supply and demand has nothing to do with it, right? Russia is the second largest oil producer in the world....

7296 2018-06-13 12:51:15 You did this with the Saudi whom you visit in your first days as president.   Your Excutive Order to let US oil export go to world prices.    Stop US exports of oil and our prices will go down
7297 2018-06-13 12:51:11 Wild theory. @realDonaldTrump to pull as many trade deals and impose max tariffs as possible to eventually render $ worthless. All in line with Russia & China cahoots on gold backed oil contracts. $BTC to absorb the USD hyper inflation. 250k will not be 250k as we know it.

7300 2018-06-13 12:51:03 Agree. Defense stocks took a dive yesterday. She is most likely to air & least likely to be fired. (My issue w/ Maddow was her research & special to prove Iraq about oil. PNAC documents made public 1998-2000 stated that.)
7301 2018-06-13 12:51:03 were Neville Chamberlain a snake oil salesman...
7302 2018-06-13 12:51:00 You never know where you'll be when a good idea hits. (like getting an oil change or the frozen food section )
7303 2018-06-13 12:50:46 Small hands, so how? RT @realDonaldTrump: Oil prices are too high, OPEC is at it again. Not good!
7304 2018-06-13 12:50:45 Oil prices went up because Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear agreement. He's the direct cause of higher oil prices. Don't let him fool you.
7305 2018-06-13 12:50:43 Still going for that $500 billion dollar oil mine in Russia huh, you guys probably are secretly already doing it and you're a viel piece of shit @realDonaldTrump for doing it. Nobody enjoys you by there side. You will be alone, you treasonous traitor. #FUCKTRUMP #MAGA
7306 2018-06-13 12:50:42 Oil prices too high! BLAME TRUMP not OPEC.
7307 2018-06-13 12:50:41 As I figured, the guys running the shop says he does this every time he comes in. Argues and makes them prove what type of oil and how much his car gets lol.
7308 2018-06-13 12:50:38 I would be more comfortable with oil being around $70. Just saying
7309 2018-06-13 12:50:38 @realDonaldTrump One solution is finally getting rid of the Maduro regime in Venezuela — country with the highest oil reserves in the world but an underwhelming oil output. Used to be #1 supplier of oil to the US, now nowhere near, partly b/c of failed past US foreign policies.
7310 2018-06-13 12:50:32 Crude oil $70 per Barrel; pump price should be $2.00 per gal. Not $3 or $4.  President Obama would tell oil industries to adjust pump prices accordingly, or be fined, and they would! Can you get the prices lower than Obama? @CNN
7311 2018-06-13 12:50:31 Baby oil/olive oil
7312 2018-06-13 12:50:31 i think it was fuel oil because there was a lot of it and low demand whereas there was a high demand for petrol but not much of it so the fuel oil can be cracked into petrol to fulfill the demand :)
7313 2018-06-13 12:50:27 This guy dey br3 oo. 
Masa go search some goat  then oil then take go.
7314 2018-06-13 12:50:19 stop the oil export,
why should sell our oil to China ?

7316 2018-06-13 12:50:13 Because it said what do you do the cracking TO. You do cracking to get petrol but you have to use fuel oil
7317 2018-06-13 12:50:04 Bet he doesn’t use phrases like that on OPEC individuals and how they CONTROL oil prices!
7318 2018-06-13 12:49:55 U smell like pussy Stank RT @realDonaldTrump: Oil prices are too high, OPEC is at it again. Not good!

7324 2018-06-13 12:49:38 not exactly 

Germany extended herself. did not agree her objectives...did they want to capture Moscow for pride? or the oil fields in the Urals to literally kill of the Soviet Union.

Hitler overruled his Geberals and went for pride
7325 2018-06-13 12:49:36 No. They aren’t. I’m sure you’re unaware but this is a good thing for domestic oil producers.
7326 2018-06-13 12:49:36 If Obama can force the CEO of Ford to resign, why can't you tell the oil companies to lower the prices?

7330 2018-06-13 12:49:16 George W. Bush had an ax to grind regarding Saddam Hussein & the invasion of Iran which may have been needed to occur someday perhaps, should not have been in retaliation to 911. They were Saudi, and not Iraqi. Saudi's are too wealthy {Oil} & powerful to have a War with though
7331 2018-06-13 12:49:16 How about quit selling our oil overseas and keep it here? US reserves larger than Saudi.
7332 2018-06-13 12:49:10 So Iranian sanctions limit their ability to sell oil. Plus Venezuela is in chaos. US now has more oil than ever. And OPEC actually said they would increase production. So....maybe it’s a supply / demand dynamic that you didn’t help with tearing up the Iran deal. Economics R hard

7334 2018-06-13 12:49:09 Your fault for backing out of Iran deal. That took over 500,000 barrels off market. You did to help Russian oil prices increase.
7335 2018-06-13 12:49:08 True that fossil fuels enjoy the most money of any industry on earth, but you know what grows from roots like that.  "Nearly 90 percent of oil and gas contributions in 2016 went to Republicans. For the coal industry, those numbers are closer to nearly 100 percent"

7344 2018-06-13 12:48:42 It definitely is. Here is my prediction, in the very near future @realDonaldTrump is going to use rising oil prices to justify the removal of sanctions against Russia to allow Russian controlled oil and natural gas  to flow freely to the west.

7360 2018-06-13 12:47:53 The amount of oil the US gets from Iran is negligible, 40% of US supply comes from Canada with 69% of our supply coming from our top 5 suppliers, none of which are Iran

7371 2018-06-13 12:46:31 You are right, Mr. President! OPEC has been purposely colluding to withhold available supplies of oil from the global market and several of those countries are members of the WTO! Who pays? Hard-working U.S. consumers.

In 2000 under similar data we entered a recession blamed on Greenspan hikes. Solution was to lower. From here, we have to raise to be able to lower!
7377 2018-06-13 12:46:20 Getting an oil change and this man's bill is like $38. He is mad because he didn't think His oil change and a bulb change should cost $38. Adding the charge for labor as if you aren't always charged for labor and that's your bill lol.

7398 2018-06-13 12:45:07 No, just facts! Oil prices are high because your President bailed us out of the Iran Nuclear deal which essentially means 500,000 barrels a day of Iranian production is off the global market.  Trump needs to take Economics 101!

It's entirely up to them how much oil they extract (which is what drives prices.) 

Additionally. Iran is an oil producing nation and you President just slapped sanctions on them!
7416 2018-06-13 12:44:07 They have a combined worth of $1.16 billion. Hardly impoverished. That's exactly it. Oil magnates & the like should also have to answer for it.

7433 2018-06-13 12:42:38 Oil prices are up because demand is up.  There have been tankers anchored in the Caribbean for 2 years just waiting for demand & prices to increase before they would come to port.
7434 2018-06-13 12:42:38 That's nice, double support to markets Kim ease off & oil comment will make support to our market .. #SouthEastern
7435 2018-06-13 12:42:37 Mr. President we need to generate more of our own energy in order to #MAGA. We need coal, oil, nuclear, hydroelectric, geothermal, solar, and everything else our great scientists can come up with.
7436 2018-06-13 12:42:36 Furnace broke and everything smells like oil...waiting on repair guys 
7437 2018-06-13 12:42:22 Nothing says welcome back from vacation than your car needing an oil change and jury duty after an hour and a half delay back to Wisconsin #CrushedByTheRealWorld
7438 2018-06-13 12:42:19 And saudi arabia should export lot of oil that to down the prices. Not bad but itsn't the best way
7439 2018-06-13 12:42:18 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.
7440 2018-06-13 12:42:18 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
7441 2018-06-13 12:42:14 Why are we still playing the OPEC games. Where is the oil from the completed pipeline and from Anwar. #ENERGYINDEPENDENTUSA
7442 2018-06-13 12:42:13 The Cabels are responsible for high oil price especially those exploiting  & Stealing Biafran resources, Buhari, Fulani & his Master Britain
7443 2018-06-13 12:42:10 Tell that to the boys in Houston. You’re an oil exporter now and I would think you would want the most for your product. You and your Iran deal caused this. Russian oil benefits because of you. You’re fucking brilliant.
7444 2018-06-13 12:42:06 นี่ขออนุญาตนับวันรอเป็นเพื่อนน้องออยค่า
7445 2018-06-13 12:42:01 Can't drill at any lower oil price. 

7446 2018-06-13 12:41:56 . It’s your policies that are causing instability that cause high prices thick shit. When you leave the Middle East then oil will be $10 a barrel you ugly barrel.
7447 2018-06-13 12:41:56 Just like Saudi Arabia who want to start flexing their oil money via sports events, like we’ve joked about on M101 when the WWE and now Formula E came to town. Match made in heaven.
7448 2018-06-13 12:41:55 How close are we to energy independence? Do we really just buy foriegn oil just to prop up other countries?
7449 2018-06-13 12:41:47 Watching a news channel while getting my oil changed.   Depressing!  #Confirms why I typically don’t watch ANY news!  #controlwhaticancontrol
7450 2018-06-13 12:41:44 Wale please clean your mouth, oil is there.
7451 2018-06-13 12:41:44 How much of this spare capacity is due to the collapse of Venezuelan oil production?
7452 2018-06-13 12:41:38 So I found out recently that the peanut butter we use at my job (smoothies) has palm oil in it, and since we mass produce said peanut butter, that's horrible for the environment. So, I emailed our CEO to make some changes. Fingers crossed he replies 
7453 2018-06-13 12:41:35 matutuloy yan, dami pa kong oil pastel at paint dito
7454 2018-06-13 12:41:33 in America we have our own oil and Energy sir 
7455 2018-06-13 12:41:33 Oil price is fine.
7456 2018-06-13 12:41:27 Maybe starting another massacre as Gaza will lower oil prices. It's worth a try, right?
7457 2018-06-13 12:41:25 Release some reserves T, that’ll teach them. Put some oil rigs right off LA’s beaches .
7458 2018-06-13 12:41:20 Trump’s reckless decision to pull out of the Iran deal has led to higher oil prices! These higher oil prices are translating directly to soaring gas prices, that disproportionately hurts middle-and lower-income people, since a larger chunk of their disposable income goes for gas.
7459 2018-06-13 12:41:17 *Bill changes moisturizer to olive oil.....
7460 2018-06-13 12:41:15 Trump moaning about oil ... PPI jumps on oil
7461 2018-06-13 12:41:10 Yea, oil prices are too high. Even in Africa. OPEC is finishing Africa's money and we'll remain poor until Jesus returns.
7462 2018-06-13 12:41:06 No kidding about oil prices. Coincidentally they started rising as soon as the stable genius pulled out of the Iran deal. TRump doesn't even understand basic macro economics.
7463 2018-06-13 12:41:04 You can do nothing. It isn't only oil prices that are high. Everything in the US is climbing, from food to healthcare...people are going bankrupt...all thanks to you Trump. As long as your tax scam keeps filling your bank account is your only concern.
#VoteBlue #LIEGATETRUMP
7464 2018-06-13 12:41:04 Squeaky wheel gets the oil! 
7465 2018-06-13 12:41:03 Oil prices are too high because of your stupidity. Don't blame it on OPEC. Off course they always wanted higher prices for their oi. But other real presidents/ Mr Obama kept it low.
7466 2018-06-13 12:40:54 Agreed!!! you give us a tax break and then take it away with high oil prices!
7467 2018-06-13 12:40:39 ヒプマイオンリー
7468 2018-06-13 12:40:37 #StableGenius Returning sanctions to Iran took oil off the market. Lower supply means higher prices.
7469 2018-06-13 12:40:32 There is so much Joy in Nigeria when oil prices are high, it brings Joy.
7470 2018-06-13 12:40:28 Natural gas, wind, solar ... better options we could use, exploit.... and technologies to export ... but need to get "off" the fossil coal and oil titties
7471 2018-06-13 12:40:27 あ、猫…！と、遠回りしようぜ？
7472 2018-06-13 12:40:24 Mix castor oil with vitamin e oil and coconut oil and apply it with a spoolie every night!! I had the same issue when i took mine out and they grew back longer then before within like 2 weeks!
7473 2018-06-13 12:40:22 he just has to cancel Obama's 2016 oil export bill
7474 2018-06-13 12:40:21 Sounds like good stuff, Lisa! I had similar problems with natural deodorants.  I add a drop of citrus essential oil like bergamot or tangerine...good to go:)
7475 2018-06-13 12:40:21 So it must be just a coincidence that oil prices went up as soon as the Iran Nuclear Deal was renigged on?
7476 2018-06-13 12:40:19 independent research states that once DonaldTrump opens his mouth, his staff wants to become politician
7477 2018-06-13 12:40:18 Please sir santa Blessing we the people not Make Oil very expensive sir. We Love you president Trump 
7478 2018-06-13 12:40:14 @realDonaldTrump Since you mentioned the Oil Prices itself, QUIT SELLING OUR OIL to other countries.  Stock it up on USA Territory, this way we will not be dependent on Saudi Arabia.  Wake up, you know we are getting stupid of selling our oil out.  Why, why, why???
7479 2018-06-13 12:40:14 人に会うたびに膨らんだって言われるけど、明日氷河期が来たら生き残るのは僕だよ。
7480 2018-06-13 12:40:09 Opec (was) suppressing production. Saudi's have started ramping up. Oil is priced globally. You are right about refinerys. They are way cleaner and more efficient but we still need new building.

7482 2018-06-13 12:40:07 They're doing it because they are desperately trying to make weak minded people believe that your economic policies are to blame. I remember when I originally realized their game was when George W. left office & oil prices suddenly fell drastically.

7485 2018-06-13 12:40:04 We buy very little from them. Why does our oil prices follow their lead
7486 2018-06-13 12:40:03 Trudeau decimated our oil industry.  Trudeau walked away from TPP in Japan, humiliating Abe. Trudeau virtue signals on climate change when it’s obvious Canada has little effect.  And we are to believe Trump is the cause?

7495 2018-06-13 12:39:34 The USA , Mexico and Canada have more oil within their boarders than the Saudi Arabians and other middle eastern countries. We also have the advanced technology to extract more from less productive areas . We as the North Americans should form an  treaty based only on oil .
7496 2018-06-13 12:39:10 It's their oil. It's up to them. That's how the world works.
7497 2018-06-13 12:39:04 It cleanses bacteria from your body, it puts you in a calm meditation state of mind. The vinegar an oil makes your skin so soft
7498 2018-06-13 12:39:04 Get the ND oilfields running again.  Open will drive the price of oil down because of the competition.

7503 2018-06-13 12:38:49 But keep that to yourself and spare yourself humiliation by going around saying water and oil mix to people.
7504 2018-06-13 12:38:37 Very True Mr President. OPEC is hurting small businesses (like mine) all across America. We are not free as long as foreign entities control our oil and therefore our profitability.
7505 2018-06-13 12:38:31 How is it OPEC fault that you pulled out of the Iran deal that cut off Iranian oil?
7506 2018-06-13 12:38:27 Literally only slept through the night a handful of times between 1988 and 2007.
7507 2018-06-13 12:38:26   Really your talking about oil price , But most of people saying you're  people who decide oil price.
7508 2018-06-13 12:38:26 The US reneging on the Iran deal is a big part of the increase in the oil price. Are your buddies in OPEC telling you the prices will be dropped so you can take credit? You are the puppet.
7509 2018-06-13 12:38:23 You’re right!!! And it’s all your fault!! Remember Iran deal?  You blew that off!!! Now oil prices climbing because of that!! All your fault!!  We need to vote BLUE!!
7510 2018-06-13 12:38:23 :( RT @realDonaldTrump: Oil prices are too high, OPEC is at it again. Not good!
7511 2018-06-13 12:38:20 "And also at current prices US oil producers are still losing money. Adding to their $500bil of losses since 2007."

If not for cheap credit, the "shale phenomenon" would have been a distant memory by now.
7512 2018-06-13 12:38:17 Right. Threats of trade wars, tariffs, destabilizing the world, Middle East unrest, pushing allies away — yeah those things don’t shift oil prices and production. But hey, it’s capitalism!
7513 2018-06-13 12:38:15 Getting this oil diffuser was such a fire move.
7514 2018-06-13 12:38:13 Oga Rauf @raufaregbesola are you saying that without federal allocation coming from crude oil in the South you despise so much you cannot generate revenue to pay your workers? If the workers are not generating revenue for the state then what are they working for if I may ask?
7515 2018-06-13 12:38:06 No you are responsible because of the Iran deal repeal. That was our link to oil we are again at the mercy of the Saudis

7525 2018-06-13 12:37:34 @realDonaldTrump Oil is way too high being there is so much available. Another game being played at America’s expense. Next item that needs to be addressed please.

7527 2018-06-13 12:37:31 I agree. I'm hoping we can end this "short supply" scam. this has gone on long enough.  When I was in college the professors said we would be out of oil by now. Its a lie, and the govt should finally step in.
7528 2018-06-13 12:37:15 Oil prices have literally traded sideways for a week now.

#LiarInChief
@WhiteHouse @PressSec
7529 2018-06-13 12:37:14 Guess you did not realize that taking Iran Oil off the market would increase prices.

Let me say if for you:

"Who knew how complicated the world oil market is?"

You are not #MAGA
7530 2018-06-13 12:37:10 What are you doing about that?  Are you allowing alternative energy sources to grow to compete and pry America away from depency on foreign oil?

No?  

What is your solution?  Bomb OPEC?
7531 2018-06-13 12:37:09 Halliburton Oil will be hosting a job fair for several positions from  entry level to more advanced at the Doubletree Hotel in Fort Smith (700  Rogers Avenue) on Wednesday, June 13 from 9:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m.
7532 2018-06-13 12:37:07 I get called a blasphemer when I start to reveal the truth about the KJV. The cabal priests have convinced people not to bother reading the Old Testament where the TRUTH about the Holy oil is. It is the healing gift from God and the true baptismal.
7533 2018-06-13 12:37:04 Issue an executive order to fix the price of oil at $35 per barrel.
7534 2018-06-13 12:37:04 This is one thing I disagree with. LA TX NM need these oil prices
7535 2018-06-13 12:37:03 Not true. Why blame OPEC when oil prices are because of your shortsighted “policies.”  Dumb and dumber.
7536 2018-06-13 12:37:01 Fuel oil testers are identifying problems with bunker oil ships get at US Gulf ports and now say that it's also a problem with bunker fuel taken on in Panama.
7537 2018-06-13 12:36:57 Oil prices went up when you started trashing the Iran deal and jumped significantly when you pulled out of the Iran deal. 
That's on you Mr President.
7538 2018-06-13 12:36:57 Why aren't the oil fields in ND fired up like they were 5 years ago so we can grow independent from OPEC?  They were shut down because OPEC drove the prices so low.
7539 2018-06-13 12:36:50 It'll be a cracking event! Enjoy it tonight. I think the whole of central belt is way more liberal with it, up north there really is an overarching mindset of being an oil engineer and making money. I'd love to come to any student talks or workshops!
7540 2018-06-13 12:36:49 Add in kill coal, American steel, and kill oil.
Add in do nothing for trade. And North Korea will have nukes.
7541 2018-06-13 12:36:44 Don’t u dare talk about oil prices..
7542 2018-06-13 12:36:43 your right in a way but under you that person says the president does not control oil prices or fuel prices and that's the right answer it is truly supply and demand and gas always goes up in the summer
7543 2018-06-13 12:36:38 Criticizing OPEC makes oil prices fall. Manipulating the stock market again. Guess who gains? Russian Oil!
7544 2018-06-13 12:36:35 I’m sure your innocuous tweet about it will make oil prices come tumbling down in record time.
7545 2018-06-13 12:36:25 It's time to learn to live without oil, Donnie. America consumes too much oil.
7546 2018-06-13 12:36:19 Oil prices are high because of you!
7547 2018-06-13 12:36:17 As far as oil companies..Chevron has been restructuring for about 2 years..layoff have been happing..Halliburton also restructure and many people were force to retire..the largest carrot company her has close a plant and are adding robots to replace the 300 hundred employees
7548 2018-06-13 12:36:10 Producer prices, inflation continuing to firm. Tight labor market, fiscal stimulus, higher oil prices, tariffs, restricting immigrant labor. Be interesting to see the Fed's reaction today. Inflation may be structurally restrained in long term, but we are in cyclical upswing now
7549 2018-06-13 12:36:01 Did you see that on Faux news because CNBC June 13- Oil prices fell on Wednesday, hit by rising  supplies in the United States and expectations that producer cartel OPEC  could relax voluntary output cuts. OIL RICES DROP!!!
7550 2018-06-13 12:35:58 A snake oil salesman flew all the way to Singapore to peddle his wares. He came home with twice as much snake oil. "Success!" he exclaimed. "Success!"
7551 2018-06-13 12:35:55 Didn't he said US is exporting oil so it should be good.
7552 2018-06-13 12:35:54 Ｃ型砲にやっぱり改修値ついてた٩(๑`^´๑)۶
7553 2018-06-13 12:35:54 I have to agree with this on a personal level.

I've been tired since 2005.
7554 2018-06-13 12:35:48 Once again you are passing on fake information. Oil prices are going up because this country is being ran by a snake oil salesperson and con artist. You cancelled the treaty with Iran and now they will hold America by the balls.
7555 2018-06-13 12:35:40 maksudnya ku nanya ada yg mau jual kleveru rosehip oil ga:( -s
7556 2018-06-13 12:35:36 Do we really need oil from Opec? Mexico has oil and they owe us for taking care of their citizens who come here illegally. Also they owe us for the wall. Time to stop dealing with Saudi Arabia, they sponsor terrorism.
7557 2018-06-13 12:35:35 My friend and my president Donald Thrump it is not your falt or anybody' s of the increase in the oil World wide is that our Lord and God is coming soon and all what is happening and shall be happening in the future is written in the Holy Bible
7558 2018-06-13 12:35:34 Should'a been fix by other administrations years ago - you should not have had to deal with this - but it's OK you'll fix it Mr Pres! U the Donald - the Real One - Likely Oil prices too high due to Obama era rules, Crooked Hillary emails to oil nations (mysteriously deleted!)
7559 2018-06-13 12:35:34 Well that was a helpful tweet.  Too bad the #MoronInChief doesn't understand there is more to oil pricing than just OPEC.
7560 2018-06-13 12:35:32 How much oil is being exported by US companies?   It should be zero if America comes first...
7561 2018-06-13 12:35:23 Yes but a last minute amendment by Grassley would make things like CBD oil not part of the bill now in Congress and make it a class one drug
7562 2018-06-13 12:35:22 Part of the oil price hike is YOU. YES YOU allowed and encouraged the sale of US oil abroad. So there’s less oil domestically so more expensive oil must be imported. Thanks!
7563 2018-06-13 12:35:12 Saudi was Islamic state who raided North Africa and enslaved Blacks and some 12 Tribes. Technically Saudi is on 12 Tribe land hence the reason USA befriended them to get oil and Slaves in trade. #SWaGodKing
7564 2018-06-13 12:35:09 Oil prices are high?  Thanks President Trump
7565 2018-06-13 12:35:04 I once watched a 20 minutes monologue in which Maddow started with talking about an accident at a refinery in Louisiana and ended with Rex Tillerson was going to seize all American oil company’s and make them all state owned. I never thought watched her show since. She’s stupid.
7566 2018-06-13 12:35:02 Have you ever fried meat while wearing just your underwear, and hot oil spills directly on your dick cap????
7567 2018-06-13 12:35:00 Oil prices are going up because of your policies, you just don’t get it you’re an absolute moron and you were offended every other nation in the world in their retaliating against us.
7568 2018-06-13 12:34:58 @FoxNews @LouDobbs @seanhannity If we have such abundance in oil and oil reserves then STOP EXPORTING oil and use it here to keep prices lower in America! 
7569 2018-06-13 12:34:40 Oil prices weren't too high before you pulled out of the Iran agreement and put sanctions back in place that prevents them from selling oil. This falls on you and no one else.
7570 2018-06-13 12:34:38 Car industry will never let full electric cars flourish because of the lack of profitability. Without gas you don’t need oil. Without oil you don’t need wars. Without wars you don’t get money.
7571 2018-06-13 12:34:35 vape oil. Please I must see
7572 2018-06-13 12:34:22 Your reckless actions are causing oil prices to skyrocket, I’m sure it’s someone else’s fault though.
7573 2018-06-13 12:34:19 You transparent fraud. High oil prices keep your Russian puppet masters hyper-wealthy. You have no interest in lowering them.
7574 2018-06-13 12:34:14 Go after your oil buddies.
7575 2018-06-13 12:34:11 It’s because Obama stop a lot of oil drilling in America and Trump is bringing it back it takes time
7576 2018-06-13 12:34:11 So Trump what are you going to do about it beside blaming OPEC. How about one of your 25% tariffs on foreign oil to protect America oil?  How about prohibiting export of oil pumped and/ or refined in the US? Why don’t you help American consumers by releasing some oil reserves?
7577 2018-06-13 12:34:06 ....too bad you guys over there are driving cars with low tech V8 engines developed in the 80s and fancy marketing names to make people believe they are buying state of the art technology. Frack your land, find that oil n burn all that shit!
7578 2018-06-13 12:33:59 Because ISIS isn’t selling crude oil no more. They flood the market with cheap oil. Now ISIS is on the outs. Oil companies are gouging us again.
7579 2018-06-13 12:33:57 You know we import more oil from Canada then Saudi Arabia.

7584 2018-06-13 12:33:30 I guess they are just applying...I thought this was them getting oil license...might be nothing news
7585 2018-06-13 12:33:19 He may be weak and sneaky, but the trade imbalance with our allies is predominately with the EU, not Canada. Good article by Dick Morris on that and our reliance on Can oil to stave off price hikes from Iran. This is the wrong battle.
7586 2018-06-13 12:33:15 Oil prices rose right after you became president.  That’s not a coincidence.
7587 2018-06-13 12:33:04 WHEN ITS GONE BE A STOP OF THIS KILLING. ITS ONLY CITIZENS HOW DYING. BUT THEY THINK THEY GONE FORCE ASSAD TOO HIVE THEM LAND FORE A PIPELINE OF GAS OIL TOO EU FROM SAUDI AND CO. AND THEN THEY CANE STOP MR PUTINS GAS/ OIL TOO EU. NEVER GONE HAPPEN
7588 2018-06-13 12:32:59 The higher oil prices are primarily due to the political instability you caused by blowing up the Iran deal.
7589 2018-06-13 12:32:54 So why not make it cheaper for US Oil. It cost more to pump our own oil than to import. That is rediclous!
7590 2018-06-13 12:32:53 Ready oil pump hnd blade..
7591 2018-06-13 12:32:52 But YOU complained about Obama’s Oil prices???!!! And your such a GREAT NEGOTIATOR & GENIUS?! YOU said it was Obama’s fault!!! Now it’s YOUR FAULT you DUMBAZZ!!! GET OUT “NOW”!!!

7594 2018-06-13 12:32:34 Thanks for this donnie. Under President Obama we had oil prices that were lower than we are at now. Who do we blame for this little feckless wonder?
7595 2018-06-13 12:32:32 I use CBD oil to manage my stress and anxiety. Before I started using it, I was having a very hard time and nothing else would work. I swear by it.

7603 2018-06-13 12:31:52 As oil prices go up, "Big American Oil" gets excited, goes looking for more expensive oil which creates good paying jobs. What's wrong with Trump?

7609 2018-06-13 12:31:35 Seriously. NEVER use oil on burns. It makes it much worse. What really helps is putting yoghurt on it or aloe vera. And pleaaaase use a mineral sunscreen. Your face is way too precious to be burned like that.
7610 2018-06-13 12:31:25 Trump decided to start public transport and shut down planes to improve oil price by reducing demand ;)
7611 2018-06-13 12:31:15 We that are among the poor love what you are doing to help the citizens of USA. But I must say I wandered if you would ever notice how much we are being hurt with these outrageous gas prices. Yes O.P.E.C. is at it again, we are also an oil producing country. PLEASE DO SOMETHING!!
7612 2018-06-13 12:31:08 don't you know, the less than 10% of our oil that comes from OPEC, which has almost no power now that we have cheaper sources, is totes in charge of oil prices. [The only way this could be true is if OPEC has kompromat on Trump for price fixing]
7613 2018-06-13 12:31:08 OPEC can keep its oil, if we have enough to export then we have enough to be self sub staining.  Like you say — America First!
7614 2018-06-13 12:31:07 Gas and oil prices skyrocketed the minute you pulled out of the Iran deal (which unlike your “deal” with KJU had a timetable and monitoring visits). The US imports most of its gas and oil from Canada, but your Russian pals (Tillerson’s Exxon Deal) are the ones benefiting
7615 2018-06-13 12:31:04 Ako na ang magaling magluto.  antagal ko ng iniisip yung lasa nung talong na niluyo sa olive oil, garlic at chili. Yun pala chili garlic paste lang ang katapat 
7616 2018-06-13 12:30:57 Trump again says oil prices too high
7617 2018-06-13 12:30:52 It’s ok folks. John Bolton, a Dubya Republican will use high oil prices as a pretext for yet another @GOP driven war...
7618 2018-06-13 12:30:52 With expectations of increased supply, oil prices see a drop today
7619 2018-06-13 12:30:50 Forget OPEC. The US had a surplus of oil and gas with all the drilling here, so why are gas prices so high? Manipulation.

7624 2018-06-13 12:30:28 Well, ask American oil producers, drillers, and support companies and they will tell you it's at a sweet spot, and allows new rigs to be built. This leads to less dependance on the Middle East. #OilPrices #POTUS #Oil #OPEC

7626 2018-06-13 12:30:21 We’re the largest consumer of oil if they don’t sell to us who are they going to sell it too?
7627 2018-06-13 12:30:17 I was responding to his question about prior recessions. I was saying there is much more capex intensity or energy now vs the past... which is why falling oil = slowing economy. You are saying the same thing.

7635 2018-06-13 12:29:58 We are one of the biggest oil producers in the world, and yet the citizens of other oil-producing countries pay dimes per gallon for their gas.  The American people still getting ripped off six ways to Sunday.
7636 2018-06-13 12:29:54 I know. Pero maraming dapat tingnan ehh. Like yung policies ni Trump sa trade, bumababa dollar reserve natin kasi kaunti lang pumapasok na dollar sa bansa, and oil price can somehow affect the value of dollar ehh. Pero ito ung times na masaya magpapalit ng dollar. Hehehe
7637 2018-06-13 12:29:53 Oh here we go....now it all makes sense. Russian oil, N. Korea to S. Korea pipeline, drilling in the Gulf of Mexico & Everglades,  etc. Who needs OPEC?

7644 2018-06-13 12:29:20 I thought we no longer depended on OPEC oil?
7645 2018-06-13 12:29:19 While we have plenty of oil, since it doesn’t come flying out of the ground as it does in Saudi Arabia, there is a price point for oil at which it makes sense for us to produce our own.  Until it gets to that point, we’d have to make a conscious decision to pay more for it.
7646 2018-06-13 12:29:16 D oil town. Haha
7647 2018-06-13 12:29:14 That's on you. I guess you will be pushing for America's reliance on Russian oil. Putin's agenda, you got to get it done on the backs of the public, right? #PutinBootlicker
7648 2018-06-13 12:29:05 We don't need the well wishes of a snake oil salesman like you. Stay away from our celebration. You'll just ruin it with your underhanded tactics and hidden agenda like you did our nation!!!

7650 2018-06-13 12:28:55 No don you tore up the Iran deal. Putting sanctions on their oil limiting supply. While maintaining demand. It’s called supply side economics. Why when the USA is a net exporter of oil. Is the price going up. Moron don fails basic economics easily.
7651 2018-06-13 12:28:53 stop buying their crappy high priced oil...America doesn't need it

7658 2018-06-13 12:28:35 For years the left and their collaborators in the mainstream media painted Republicans and neocons as warmongers; blood for oil, wag the dog, etc. Today those same “peaceniks” are attempting to discredit the most substantial negotiations for world peace since the Cold War.

7667 2018-06-13 12:28:10 Oil prices are high because you've screwed up the economy.
7668 2018-06-13 12:28:10 But you know that Obongo laid the ground work and is the reason President Trump got it done. Just like NK, jobs, economy and even the oil pipeline.
7669 2018-06-13 12:28:09 It's funny oil prices were very low when Obama was in office. But you are the oil and gas puppet and now oil prices are through the roof. I don't think we can blame OPEC for this one
7670 2018-06-13 12:28:02 Luckily the US is self sufficient in oil, and all those patriotic US Oil Company CEOs will be willing to sell their product at a loss on the world market to ease domestic prices. Win / Win! Or, ask Putin for some of their oil... He's a BFF of America.
#IdiotInChief #ignorant
7671 2018-06-13 12:28:01 Oil prices were fine before you took office.
7672 2018-06-13 12:27:56 Oil is only $62 a barrell. The issue is fuel prices, not oil itself. Last time pump prices were as they are now, oil was well in excess of $100 a barrell.
7673 2018-06-13 12:27:50 We are in sun and we used oil that call burn compose) oil was for hell jupiter to stay under ground and keep erase the negative effects to burn in hight densities so oil or petrol or gas not appropriate to green that why we hurricanes today if u put oil in sun it burn smoke

7677 2018-06-13 12:27:23 We have enough oil between us and Canada put a tariff on oil from Middle East about $500 a barrel should do it till they’re ready to bring the price down to $30 a barrel
7678 2018-06-13 12:27:20 Republicans gave oil biz massive tax cuts (they are rewarding shareholders) & ignorantly meddled w the Iran Deal. Trump doesn't get to act surprised when he caused gas prices to increase 21%+ the past yr. Americans are expected to pay an extra $38B in 2018 thanks to him. #MAGA
7679 2018-06-13 12:27:11 Help us get rid of the castrocommunist regime and you’ll have access to the world’s largest oil reserves right in your backyard
7680 2018-06-13 12:27:08 Gas prices have nothing to do with the tariffs.  Its directly related to oil price and refinery out put.  Open up the us refineries and gas prices will drop.
7681 2018-06-13 12:27:07 Maybe blowing up that Iran deal wasn't such a good idea. If we are really lucky oil should be at $5 to $7 dollars a gallon right around the 1st of November.
7682 2018-06-13 12:27:06 Maybe you should institute "Backyard Oil Wells", so we can get on top of it?

7686 2018-06-13 12:26:39 It’s didn’t help oil prices when you tore up the nuclear agreement with Iran . Thanks Donald !
7687 2018-06-13 12:26:37 Fair oil price should be 30$ and not more.When oil price is very high its bad impact US economy.But some forces, people or Opec artificially raise the price.
7688 2018-06-13 12:26:32 Don't worry. The word "MODI " is a brand now and a " USP". Unity is a simple word with complex formation . Can you mix water with oil? If not forget about Khichadi. NDA will remain intact and new smaller parties would join .
7689 2018-06-13 12:26:26 Part of the reason that oil prices are getting higher is directly because of increasing instability in the region because of YOUR actions dotard!!!!!! 
7690 2018-06-13 12:26:24 The pump cost absolutely needs to come down. This is just silly... thought we found a bunch of our own oil. We shouldn't need anyone for oil.

7700 2018-06-13 12:26:04 Once again the grifter speaks, a couple of photo ops, shocks S Koreans with an end to War games, promises a dictator the sun moon and stars and cons his people that he is the best, please America wake up and smell the snake oil!!!
7701 2018-06-13 12:26:03 Oil prices to high, OPEC at it again. Not good, we are going to lose so many votes at upcoming election.
7702 2018-06-13 12:25:32 Are you a preacher? A motivational.speaker, perhaps? No. You are a lying piece of sh*t who is a wanna be dictator. You've conned & sold snake oil to millions. It is not MAGA, it's #MANA: Make America Nazis Again.
7703 2018-06-13 12:25:28 Kinda funny when Trump asked OPEC to slow oil output. Thus causing high prices. Slap on his pulling out of The Iran deal. Yep this is solely on this idiots watch!!
7704 2018-06-13 12:25:22 You don't get oil jobs and low oil prices, pick one.
7705 2018-06-13 12:25:22 I feel some of it has to do with oil prices an the other has to do with summer travel on vacations
7706 2018-06-13 12:25:09 Don't neglect the hair under your beard - use beard oil to keep it hydrated, as well as conditioning the hair. #malegrooming #fathersday #wednesdaywisdom
7707 2018-06-13 12:25:09 Carter is an anomaly. Look to the years right before his presidency. Unlike any in history. He actually was ahead of his time in many ways, but was not the right timing. He put solar panels on WH, and Reagan tore them off because he loved big oil....
7708 2018-06-13 12:25:09 Ya your right lower black and Hispanic unemployment. Chinese tariffs lowered. Lower regulation on our businesses. More permits to drill for oil. Holding countries accountable to pay their share for nato. It goes on and on Bishop. Your still on the Democratic plantation!
7709 2018-06-13 12:25:02 Most of our foreign oil (40%) comes from Canada...you have not done anything to piss them off, have you?
In addition, currently less than 20% of the oil we use in the USA comes from outside the USA....so, it would seem domestic choices, not OPEC, is to blame....It is not 1973.
7710 2018-06-13 12:24:53 Result of pulling out of Iran deal. Putting sanctions on Iran restricts their ability to sell oil. Without Iranian oil, global supply decreases. When supply decreases, prices increase.
This simple lesson in economics brought to you by me
7711 2018-06-13 12:24:52 Every time oil prices increase you blame OPEC.  US oil companies, of coarse, have nothing to do with rising prices nor does your administrations policy agenda of suppressing cheaper renewable energy alternatives. #getaclue #stopblamingeveryoneelse #renewableenergy
7712 2018-06-13 12:24:41 Turkey is just 70% bone and 10% oil. 

Smh
7713 2018-06-13 12:24:37 I dont know....not sure the author made any pts that counter widely held notions that a sunset clause would reduce investment by biz. Trade agreements this large are meant to be stablizing. AND NAFTA has a mechanism for changes Chapt 13 and WTO. Oil sands are a red herring
7714 2018-06-13 12:24:34 Lol u r kidding right? oil prices have been doing this long b4 he ever even mentioned the word trade u know I know u guys love blaming everything on Trump but get a grip every pres I know has yelled bout oil prices
7715 2018-06-13 12:24:31 Carajo!!! Que buena reflexión. @Radiolibertaria @zamoralibre @urquiafm Esto tiene que hacer eco en toda la Patria!! Nuestros ancestros son cuna de civilización y asi se reconoce en la CBRV @AmalCandanguera
7716 2018-06-13 12:24:30 I love the oil sets!
7717 2018-06-13 12:24:29 i baked it lol i will with monster he is so i use cooking oil
7718 2018-06-13 12:24:29 Gee. I wonder what action caused more unrest in the middle east and causing the rise in oil prices....seems right after you backed out of the Iran deal....a better deal than your NK deal....the prices started going up. So much for your "great"tax cuts.
7719 2018-06-13 12:24:28 Captain leader legend steps up!  #Espana
7720 2018-06-13 12:24:22 @realDonaldTrump Good job. Pls help Nigeria ban sale of Crude oil & other major resources for cash except for resources too like Technology
7721 2018-06-13 12:24:06 When you say things like that, you sound just as foolish as the vegans.  Kale, brussel sprouts, cauliflower sauteed in bacon grease or coconut oil is delicious and people eat them because they taste great not because they are anti-meat.  Carnivores need to be open minded too.

7723 2018-06-13 12:23:52 It's not OPEC! It's your rich friends in the American oil businesses! Tell your friends to knock it off! They are spoiling what ever good you did with taxes!  Yes, we have more in our paychecks but spend more at the pumps! Do something!
7724 2018-06-13 12:23:44 Unless they undermine a complex deal that had major supplier Iran in the mix. Now they are out, so there’s your high oil prices. Thanks Trump.
7725 2018-06-13 12:23:42 Dear "#MAGA" - this is another @POTUS lie. Oil prices too high and rising because Moron in Chief exited the Iran deal.
7726 2018-06-13 12:23:37 Thought you were all for capitalism? How about investing in renewables so we can lesson our oil dependence ?
7727 2018-06-13 12:23:35 Maybe they'll put tariffs on U.S. oil?
7728 2018-06-13 12:23:33 Crude oil futures for July contract lower again. $WTI_Crude -0.54% at $66.00, $NBZ_F -0.48% at $75.73, $USO -0.37% at $13.35 for Wednesday 06/13/18.
7729 2018-06-13 12:23:31 So you're saying your reckless decision to violate the Iran deal is not what should be discussed (clearly that impacted oil prices). Tossing out an OPEC shiny object? Your simple tweets don't make issues simple- just shows that you are shallow.
7730 2018-06-13 12:23:31 I'd try it...if I wouldn't have the biggest distaste for the smell of tea tree oil 
7731 2018-06-13 12:23:23 Huh. Maybe we should have kept our word with Iran, considering they have access to oil. But I'm only one of your constituents, and you work for me, not the other way around. Fuck me, right?
7732 2018-06-13 12:23:22 OPEC sets the prices for barrel of oil cost.

If it wasn't for America drilling for oil on private land, we would be paying $6 to $10 per gallon. What Obama wanted.
7733 2018-06-13 12:23:18 Where is our home oil production? We Americans have to be the Masters of Our Own Destiny especially when it come to oil! Can be subjected to CARTELS Like OPEC! Expressionist!
7734 2018-06-13 12:23:16 Remember the time you withdrew from the Iran deal and oil prices shot up (and haven’t come down)?
7735 2018-06-13 12:23:12 หรือจะไปดีนะ
7736 2018-06-13 12:23:09 You know who has lots of oil? Canada. Be nice.
7737 2018-06-13 12:23:06 Have you read the Executive Order's yet? I know it's a major number of readings but actually it looks like Trump is going to return the Dollar into a gold/silver backed currency, instead of oil. There are many indications (the whole economic boom and raise of $-power) for that
7738 2018-06-13 12:23:05 Oil prices are too high because of your idiotic foreign policies, you fucking moron.
7739 2018-06-13 12:22:58 @GISH Hey, My friend, @juliepergrem recruited me for Team Oil Rig Angels this year, but we had some trouble with the app. Will she still be eligible for the big prize?! ;)
7740 2018-06-13 12:22:54 And who benefits from rising oil prices?

OPEC and....  wait for it....Russia.
7741 2018-06-13 12:22:36 Aren't we the #1 producer of oil in the world?
7742 2018-06-13 12:22:29 Uh, the oil prices are up because you withdrew from the Iran deal. You did that so the prices would go up and Russia would be happy. The Iran deal was working, verified! N. Korean “deal” is nothing but words.
7743 2018-06-13 12:22:27 Hii ni pesa ya oil.
7744 2018-06-13 12:22:24 Why are we tying oil to global pricing??  We have our own.
7745 2018-06-13 12:22:20 อยากได้แล้ว
7746 2018-06-13 12:22:19 You cancelled the Iran deal. Now oil prices are high. What aren’t you getting moron?
7747 2018-06-13 12:22:19 Since we import most of our oil from CANADA...maybe insulting Trudeau wasn’t the greatest idea? 
7748 2018-06-13 12:22:19 李書文は来たけど沖タは来なかった
7749 2018-06-13 12:22:18 That's because Putin and Russia have aligned with OPEC to raise the world's oil prices. Looks like Putin is sticking it to us again.
7750 2018-06-13 12:22:14 I’m still not sure which is the worst of the two. The last thing I’d ever want to do is defend Donald pig, but he still hasn’t sent 100,000 troops to war based on a lie. Would he? No doubt he would, if oil were his game.
7751 2018-06-13 12:21:58 To bad our biggest oil trading partner is CANADA!!!!
7752 2018-06-13 12:21:56 ** I Know ** You need to get oil from ** Vladimir Loves You **
7753 2018-06-13 12:21:54 Because of you, oil prices are up, Joker.

7756 2018-06-13 12:21:36 Awwww...I have an oil blend for that. Hope you're better BFF!
7757 2018-06-13 12:21:36 I wonder if it’s hell’s gaping mouth? It’s terrible that the fire continues. No doubt, the best fire fighters from Houston have tried...oil fire experts may help.
7758 2018-06-13 12:21:31 Yeah, cancelling the Iran Deal destabilized the region.  Consequently oil prices have gone up.
7759 2018-06-13 12:21:26 Why do they sell us oil overseas?
7760 2018-06-13 12:21:15 Prices dropped and rose under obama too, thats what oil does.
7761 2018-06-13 12:21:15 #WorldCup2018 forecast for 14 June: #RUSKSA, aka "Gas land with steppes" #RUS vs. "Oil land with sand" #KSA: 1-0 for the hosts, with a lot of generosity. 

As for people in jail for acts that are not actual crimes and for the Yemenis...yeah, let's say it's not looking good.
7762 2018-06-13 12:21:10 The US needs to do two things, first reduce the use of home heating oil, a tax credit would be helpful for this.
Second, expand energy infrastructure. This includes but is not limited to pipe lines, tank farms, and renewable storage systems. I.e. Telsa Home Battery

7766 2018-06-13 12:21:07 oh that's right #dotard you have to import oil from countries you shit on and then complain about their unfair trading practices.  maybe should have thought this through a little bit first eh?  #fakepresident #highiqmyass
7767 2018-06-13 12:21:01 If @realDonaldTrump can get oil to $48 a barrel by August the #RedWave in November will be “yuge”
7768 2018-06-13 12:21:00 The biggest Thieve in the World is USA follow by Tory. Every war USA has embarked on is a scavenger hunt of pillaging Countries for Gold, Oil or Drugs. They weren't any Suicide Bombing in Iraq until Bush/Blair went there. #SWaGodKing
7769 2018-06-13 12:20:57 Wearing oil was not big and it definitely wasn’t clever  like a lobster

7773 2018-06-13 12:20:42 Well Donald I thought you would be so happy about this!  If we ever could see your tax returns, most likely we would see you stock holdings and I would bet you have a lot to gain in oil pricing.  It would be great if you stop testing us on our opinions and find some real advisors
7774 2018-06-13 12:20:35 Trump is the guy who buys the Rolls but never gets an oil change.  He enjoys the purchase, but hates the maintenance.
7775 2018-06-13 12:20:31 @jwolfetoyota took me more than 20 minutes to get checked in for my service today!  At 7am no less, with no one waiting in the lobby...  awesome. And then told at least an hour for an oil change.
7776 2018-06-13 12:20:27 Tea tree oil is the truth.
7777 2018-06-13 12:20:17 Why not go outside of OPEC to get oil?
7778 2018-06-13 12:20:14 Neither Obama or trump can control oil prices. Stupid comment.
7779 2018-06-13 12:20:06 Mr. President. I usually disagree with u about everything but OPEC and North Korea, i'm with u 100%. PEACE and Low Oil PRICES. Do it and may even vote for u.
7780 2018-06-13 12:20:02 sana oil
7781 2018-06-13 12:19:54 I'm always amazed depth of your tweets! "Not good"
You have NO CLUE how OPEC operates &complexities of domestic oil market. Bc if you did, you wouldn't be messing around w/ FERC &CAFE standards screwing the consumers at the pump by cost at the pump & vehicles burning more gas!
7782 2018-06-13 12:19:49 The increase in oil prices is a direct result of our growing economy. More people are on the road today than ever before, they're traveling they're working and they're taking more trips. Demand is high. Supply and demand.
7783 2018-06-13 12:19:42 Hit them with a tariff or limit how much they import Don!..many of these OPEC members do not even use oil $$ to improve their country’s wealth!
OPEC = Greed + Liars + Funding DEMS to resist Trump
7784 2018-06-13 12:19:38 That and bye-bye to 'there must be more oil flasks around here..' made my week 
7785 2018-06-13 12:19:33 Why so high in the US?  I thought we were a huge leader in oil these days?
7786 2018-06-13 12:19:30 I think Dems are colluding with our enemies to raise oil prices which causes all prices to go up which becomes inflation that they can blame on Trump to gain political advantage.  They need to counter Trump's economic successes, and inflation is their weapon.

#SpiritualLeader_SaintRampalji
7789 2018-06-13 12:19:20 He's right but the relatively high price of oil is increasingly less relevent and less of a weapon OPEC can wield against us because of our own growing reserves
7790 2018-06-13 12:19:12 Fund..coal to gasoline plants. Creates even more jobs.
Executive order...all gas.. Cannot be sold for more than 25 cents a gallon..Including tax..
Make the dollar strong again..
Gasoline is a by. Product of oil. It is not the only thing produced with oil.

 Big big Joke...Trump is short of Oil, i gues!!!
7794 2018-06-13 12:19:03 You caused it by going after Iran's. Either you have oil deals or making money out of it! The Mueller investigation should look into it!

7796 2018-06-13 12:18:55 We are told to be ready to evac in case the protesters reach our factory. Last time this happened is when the chinese put up their oil rig in VN waters. Panggulo talaga ang mga intsik na ito.
7797 2018-06-13 12:18:53 The real reasons for the price rise are the collapse of the Venezuelan economy and your decision to renege on the Iran nuclear deal which jolted global oil markets. #GasPrices
7798 2018-06-13 12:18:48 Sir,
Time for the USA to intervene on the issue. Such high oil prices will derail the global growth which is bad for all nations including oil exporters.
Time for multi pronged action from USA including increasing oil output in the USA & intervention with OPEC.
7799 2018-06-13 12:18:46 You dweeb. Once again you prove you don't understand anything about the world economy. YOUR policies are causing oil prices to go up.
7800 2018-06-13 12:18:46 Stop using oil.

7806 2018-06-13 12:18:26 Hey dumbass. I was hoping you would move to NK. You took credit (like a Dumbass) when oil prices were low. You can’t control them and you don’t know how they work.
7807 2018-06-13 12:18:24 You Dope Iran oil now not on market reducing supply
7808 2018-06-13 12:18:20 Let the cntry know fuel prices from 2004 to 2014 nd from 2014 May to till now nd the challenge whether ur govt was providing subsidy to oil companies nd this govt is providing or not. Nd also tell d entry how oil prices r not controlled by govt.
7809 2018-06-13 12:18:14 You think they're high now well guess what idiot , 60 % of your oil comes from Canada .....you know your "enemy" from the north .
7810 2018-06-13 12:18:08 Please do something about the price of oil
7811 2018-06-13 12:18:07 There is more oil in Venezuela than any other place on Earth. Why not free these people from the narco communist dictatorship that they find themselves in today, make deal for the oil, and have a new allie in our southern hemisphere? They are begging us for an intervention.
7812 2018-06-13 12:18:05 This is fanaticism. May have been practical back i "dark ages " but sticking to same concepts, virtues and laws in 21st century is absurd. 
I wonder what would those countries be like had they not found oil.
7813 2018-06-13 12:17:59 FFS!
With every fucking tweet your stupidity becomes more obvious!
You destabilize the whole ME with moving the embassy to Jerusalem and wonder how the oil price could rise?
Stupidity should cause physical pain!
7814 2018-06-13 12:17:55 Iraq, Iran, saudi started it in 1960 to control the market. Oops Donnie didn't consider that but his oil buddies and Russia will applaud him for it. BTW Russia not a member of opec 
7815 2018-06-13 12:17:46 No threat of war now with Kim Jong-Un.. Oil prices should come down.
7816 2018-06-13 12:17:44 Here's real enviro's that don't use oil.
7817 2018-06-13 12:17:42 Gas is too high, your oil buddies must be loving it. Rent is too damn high, your welfare queen slum lords must be raking in the cash. Wages are  Benefits are  We lost our healthcare. WHERE IS TRUMPCARE? You said anyone who wants it will have good affordable healthcare.
7818 2018-06-13 12:17:42 Donald J Trump gave us high oil prices. But Donald J Trump is such a great deal maker, I’m sure he can deal down for much lower prices, right??
7819 2018-06-13 12:17:32 TRUMP:

MARKETS ALSO TOO HIGH??
7820 2018-06-13 12:17:28 Nothing like starting a Wednesday mornin gn off getting 4 new tires, an oil change, and alignment. Goodbye 1100 bucks. Why do I have to have the premium wheels and tires on the car????
7821 2018-06-13 12:17:27 Invest in renewables then, coal amd oil old school
7822 2018-06-13 12:17:27 @realDonaldTrump Mr President please do something about oil prices corporate industry is using 80 percent of the oil why do America citizens who only use 20 percent of the oil pay for corporate greed this is the problem with fake captilisim here is to the haves and the have more

7825 2018-06-13 12:17:20 No it’s not OPEC it’s you, you’re influencing the price of oil going up by taking all the Iranian oil off the market to prop up gains for RUSSIA! Impeachment coming!
7826 2018-06-13 12:17:20 The highest gas prices have been during the controlling republican party since 1980. 

Why do you think big oil companies are always investing in their elections?

The higher the prices go, the more profit they make. 

It's not hard to figure out.
7827 2018-06-13 12:17:15 Oil price is not equivalent to US military& technology products. So plz  quite.

7837 2018-06-13 12:16:34 Umm....here in reality oil, groceries, rent etc are ALL high priced and going higher. Either lower the COL or raise wages with a hard stay on prices. As usual, you'll do nothing.
7838 2018-06-13 12:16:32 And also at current prices US oil producers are still losing money. Adding to their $500bil of losses since 2007... so if all production growth is unprofitable what makes oil prices high?? Maybe they are actually way too low...
7839 2018-06-13 12:16:30 screw OPEC... we need our oil lines!
7840 2018-06-13 12:16:24 Can we use boiling oil instead of water?
7841 2018-06-13 12:16:22 Oil prices are because of you. You haven’t a clue how to negotiate. Twitter isn’t negotiating tool. It’s what a weak leader uses.

7843 2018-06-13 12:16:16 Oil barrons rape the land, promise unpaid fortunes and run off with all the cash. Then they raise gas prices every summer because greed knows no bound. Not AGAIN it never stopped. #lucifer

7849 2018-06-13 12:15:51 America needs to become oil independent . And we have the resources to do it .
7850 2018-06-13 12:15:51 America first right dumbass. Well tell the American oil companies to stop exporting oil. OPEC is not driving up the price of AMERICAN OIL. American oil companies are. And you are doing nothing about it. In fact you just noticed! Not on Fox News?
7851 2018-06-13 12:15:50 Haha the guy is pure bantz but hes just secured bloody denuclearization in n. Korea... But he cant lower sum oil prices for his fellow 'muricans. Bloody cheapskate haha

7854 2018-06-13 12:15:35 No! I am in oil & gas and please think about the people employed in the industry! We need $65 to $70/barrel minimum for sustainable employment & lively-hood!!  @POTUS
7855 2018-06-13 12:15:31 Time for another summit. This one can be called the Oil Summit. During this summit you could merely state that OPEC will not change oil production to gouge Americans! This has got to end!
7856 2018-06-13 12:15:31 Oil prices are down since
7857 2018-06-13 12:15:29 Chill the f out. Oil prices are just fine. Leave it alone. Houston and surrounding areas are finally bouncing back from the local recession we experienced after historically low oil prices killed our economy. So many layoffs.
7858 2018-06-13 12:15:29 Feels a bit 2006 this. Oil funded side just dominated the league. United uninspiring season before and in transfer market (so far). Hopefully the season to follow is something like 06/7!

7860 2018-06-13 12:15:20 Policies have nothing to do with price of oil, its OPEC manipulating the price as they always have using fear tactics as justification for raising the price of a barrel, therefore raising the pump price.
7861 2018-06-13 12:15:12 Castor oil does wonders for my hair! 
7862 2018-06-13 12:15:01 Good morning sunshine:) Glad you could join us. This one will be fun to watch. You, trying to navigate oil prices, and a decades long manipulation of global markets by billionaires. Anyway to loop Canada in on the blame here? Maybe if you just say gas prices are lower... #comrade

7864 2018-06-13 12:14:49 Because the economy was weak. OPEC always raises the price of oil when the economy is strong.
7865 2018-06-13 12:14:41 What's the plan Sir?? Release from the Strategic Oil Reserve??
7866 2018-06-13 12:14:29 That was a STUPID comment! WTH does Iran have to do with oil?
7867 2018-06-13 12:14:29 It's very rare that any president, Republican or Democrat, is to blame for rising oil prices. @realDonaldTrump is the odd exception to the rule. And this is only the beginning….

7878 2018-06-13 12:13:53 I worked the Alaskan oil fields for years. As a nation we produce enough oil for our own good. Back in the 90s, it cost "Big Oil" $2 bucks to get a barrel topside another deuce to get it to a refinery when oil was $24-bucks so a $20-buck profit. Why? Oil prices are global!

7885 2018-06-13 12:13:28 Mr. President, we appreciate your support to expel the corrupt regime in Venezuela. Outside the dictatorship the oil of Venezuela contributes to the fall of the price.
7886 2018-06-13 12:13:24 Come on Mr President, the prices are fair. The industry can't be working for free plus even the renewable energy industry depends on these "medium" oil prices to stay competitive.

7896 2018-06-13 12:13:07 How can we bring the price of oil back to the free market pitting Oil Companies both here and abroad against themselves creating a "free market" benefiting the people?  Oil is one of those "controls over the people" that effects our everyday life.
7897 2018-06-13 12:13:07 Needs fixed ASAP! I thought the US is producing enough oil that we shouldn’t be affected by OPEC!
7898 2018-06-13 12:13:05 Natural gas, coal and oil are examples of what type of fuel? #trivia
7899 2018-06-13 12:12:59 Trump is the ultimate spin master. Oil prices have gone up because of him. Watch you wallets American People this man is going to cost you. Hope you catch on before it is to late.
7900 2018-06-13 12:12:52 Use less oil, invest in green now
7901 2018-06-13 12:12:50 Wow. Blaming OPEC for rising gas prices from your trade wars. OPEC’s influence on oil prices is quite limited primarily because individual countries have different incentives
7902 2018-06-13 12:12:48 All this will end soon when substitute to Oil is found as an energy source. Intense R&D is going on.

7906 2018-06-13 12:12:35 You're an idiot. Iran has nothing to do with oil prices. OPEC always raises the cost of oil when the economy is strong.
7907 2018-06-13 12:12:32 The terms "liberal" and "economist" simply do not go together. Oil/Water.

7913 2018-06-13 12:12:23 Mr. President by Executive order that what ever number of barrels of oil taken from federal lands of the Bakken Formation, needed to fill U.S. transportation needs is carved out and not counted in the international market. Set the price at $1.00 a gallon
7914 2018-06-13 12:12:22 It's Summer.  They always jack up oil prices when everyone is traveling.
7915 2018-06-13 12:12:18 Only this snake oil salesman @realDonaldTrump will determine that there is no longer a threat when the North Korea has done nothing yet to make a change.  We do not even know what agreement if any has been reached.

7921 2018-06-13 12:12:03 Whining about oil prices on Twitter will really bring down the prices. Apparently the new version of The Art of the Deal is to give up everything, get nothing and then claim victory.

7948 2018-06-13 12:10:31 The pricing  of crude oil has been been a gold mind for the US,for it knows,that like a standard of gold in the market creates a depression!
7949 2018-06-13 12:10:31 WTF? You are having a crazy morning. Putin likes high oil prices, so you are pissing him off. Obama enjoyed super stable low oil prices.
7950 2018-06-13 12:10:29 Careful, Putin is counting on those high prices because their entire economy is oil based. You don't want to piss off the guy with so much compromising material on you.

7958 2018-06-13 12:10:14 I partially agree.

Lived in both China and Vietnam, both very concerned about cryptocurrencies. 

But all we need to see is a oil rich country start selling in say Bitcoin and it would be a key target of the US.

Nothing, apparently, is allowed to compete with the almighty USD..

7961 2018-06-13 12:10:14 Dipshit you said we don't need their oil we got plenty so don't try blaming opec.. it's because of your threatened tariffs and World reaction
7962 2018-06-13 12:10:12 So far I deep condition with palmers coconut and almond oil deep conditioner .. then shampoo with Shea moisture and condition it... then use the black castor & coconut oil... nothing too complicated
7963 2018-06-13 12:10:06 Nice try. We all know high oil prices help your best friend Vlad.
7964 2018-06-13 12:10:03 So let me guess, you’re going to “demand” that they lower prices, or you’ll increase tariffs on them ?
Thought you said we were pumping out Hugh amounts of oil in US?  How can. OPEC be the only cause?
Maybe oil companies jacking up rates ?
7965 2018-06-13 12:09:51 The OPEC cartel is long overdue to be shut down. It has hurt America many times for over 40 years!  Tax the oil and other imports from OPEC countries and restrict military sales to them.

7967 2018-06-13 12:09:38 Mr. President, I'm in the water utility business. It is a fixed rate by the PUC. I always said oil should be fixed. It's non renewable resource. Public water is fixed at <1¢ a gallon, some cases unlimited. BUT, bottled water is $2 ea. Not right. Call me for the oppressive scoop.
7968 2018-06-13 12:09:33 Wrong! Forget Muthama. His duty will be to oil Wavinya’s campaign to frog out Mutua.
7969 2018-06-13 12:09:29 You helped Putin by walking from the Iran deal and shaking up the oil market.  Your boss is happy.
7970 2018-06-13 12:09:28 Oil and Gas prices are High right now because You had a tantrum and got US out of the Iran Peace deal, which they had been adhering to consistently!! You are a Fraud. Worst President ever!
7971 2018-06-13 12:09:28 Perhaps your latest actions on Iran, which will tamp down their ability to bring oil to world markets, have something to do with it.  Perhaps.
7972 2018-06-13 12:09:25 OPEC is obsolete, the USA under POTUS produces more oil that makes us independent of OPEC. #dumpopec and reduce oil prices.
7973 2018-06-13 12:09:25 Now oil prices are OPEC’s fault? When Obama was in office it was on him! Preemptive passing the buck here, but glad you’re acknowledging gas prices are rising. I’m sure this will be a Dem focus leading up to November.

7978 2018-06-13 12:08:53 You pulled out of the Iran deal when Iran was complying with inspections and dismantling capabilities, oil prices went up sharply. You then create a vague deal with NK that gives away everything and gets nothing. Wake up people he's #DonTheCon
7979 2018-06-13 12:08:53 You just figured that out did you.  You should have been worried more about the Middle east where the oil is than N Korea that has nothing but beaches you want to develop.
7980 2018-06-13 12:08:53 @adsteel says there’s a “conspiracy theory out there” about Trump scrapping the #Iran deal at the behest of Saudis in return for lower oil prices. 

1) A Bloomberg guest last month commented as if this was a known fact

2) Where’s the evidence OPEC is about to alter stance?
7981 2018-06-13 12:08:27 Prices are similar to 80s and price per gal is up  also, what do you want when oil is the only resource the countries we get it from has to survive.
7982 2018-06-13 12:08:24 You won't be missing the oil revenue then?
7983 2018-06-13 12:08:22 Maybe you should put some tariffs on oil.
7984 2018-06-13 12:08:20 That's the collapse of the Iran deal you torpedoed in service to Russia.

The price went up which was good for Putin because his oil draws a higher price.

Now what, you arrange for us to start buying Russian oil instead of OPEC?
7985 2018-06-13 12:08:20 When oil prices went up under Obama you blamed it on the President. So now that you are President it’s no longer the President’s fault.  At least you didn’t blame it on President Obama this time. Go back to bed and dream about your little love movie you made for Rocket man
7986 2018-06-13 12:08:17 He does realise that oil price is down - right?
7987 2018-06-13 12:08:14 You IDIOT!

They own the #oil, THEY set the price! 

That should be to your liking, it's what YOU'VE DONE, selling us out o Russia, for money, & a Trump Tower in Moscow!
7988 2018-06-13 12:08:09 What are you going to do about it TRUMP? Why don't you release some of the oil reserves?
7989 2018-06-13 12:07:57 I did a scrub with brown sugar and olive oil and my scalp feels so good now *^*
7990 2018-06-13 12:07:54 oil producers dont vote en masse, the electorate does.
7991 2018-06-13 12:07:53 これほんとに神ってた( 笑 )(*´ω｀*)
7992 2018-06-13 12:07:52 Finally, something meaningful. Yes, oil prices are high and have been for quite some time. Do something!
7993 2018-06-13 12:07:49 Let’s use our own oil for a while and stop buying from them
7994 2018-06-13 12:07:48 S&C/Performance Crowd : who has worked with essential oil diffusers in the locker room? We need to talk. I want your experiences
7995 2018-06-13 12:07:44 Adulting 101: Before a long trip, check your Oil, Tire Pressure,  Washer Fluid & Wipers, and (duh) Fuel.

7996 2018-06-13 12:07:36 Red oil and Aligator pepper no dey finish for my hand na
7997 2018-06-13 12:07:35 tariffs on oil?
7998 2018-06-13 12:07:34 I thought that what you wanted to get your oil companies on their feet again!!
7999 2018-06-13 12:07:32 Success?  He was over his head then multiple bankruptcies. He’s a narcissist, snake oil salesman who claims to have this great cure all.  Difference is I’m not chasing the wagon buying his bullshit.
8000 2018-06-13 12:07:28 You cut off an OPEC supplier, Iran. Prices are going up due to loss of Iran oil in the market.
8001 2018-06-13 12:07:22 No....high gas prices means strong economy. OPEC always raises oil prices when the economy is strong.
8002 2018-06-13 12:07:17 みよ…レンタルせなないかな…
8003 2018-06-13 12:07:15 Interesting to watch the PR arms of big tech companies starting to act like those of oil/tobacco/pharmacy companies of old. Adversarial, misleading, contemptuous of journalists that write anything but stenography.
8004 2018-06-13 12:07:12 Oil prices are just fine.  

What you mean is the gas prices are high because of inflation & oil prices.

You can't artificially change everything in the economy to fit your little agenda.

It will eventually all come crashing down and you are the blame.
8005 2018-06-13 12:07:10 Good for us, Oil is our biggest burden

He's hurting our exports though
Good for companies in long term
They are complacent focusing on US alone

Now they can explore other 190 countries for business
8006 2018-06-13 12:07:09 Race Bank is the first offshore wind farm inaugurated as @OrstedUK but the 10th by the company. This underlines shift from DONG and oil and gas to being a pure play renewable co: Matthew Wright
8007 2018-06-13 12:07:07 The President has changed the topic to oil prices. You know what to do, red hats.
8008 2018-06-13 12:07:04 東北大学は岩手大学。なるほど。つまり東北は岩手。
8009 2018-06-13 12:07:02 So the oil companies to sell domestic oil at a lower price in our domestic market. America First right? Oh that’s right, oils a globally traded commodity & oil companies want max $
8010 2018-06-13 12:06:59 We produce the most oil... Now let's build refineries of our own as well.
8011 2018-06-13 12:06:59 Mo palit najud kog oil control film kay gaaad akung face oily kaayo 
8012 2018-06-13 12:06:53 Whosoever Recognize Hebrew Biafra controls oil prices.
8013 2018-06-13 12:06:49 Well Mr. president a first grader could enlighten you here , if prices go up it will be far more easier for you suck out enough cash from oil rich countries through threats and lies, also good news for your son in law
8014 2018-06-13 12:06:41 Actually, I’m rather fond of high oil prices.
8015 2018-06-13 12:06:40 I wouldn't be surprised . . . Light our houses with whale oil too! 
8016 2018-06-13 12:06:39 Trump don’t forget where we get most of our energy from it is a neighbor called Canada. As we speak they are building a pipeline to their west coast & China has stated they will buy every drop of oil Canada produces. Why Trump would you make enemies of our great friend & Ally
8017 2018-06-13 12:06:37 be sure to alienate them too !!!!

because we can get oil anywhere !!!
8018 2018-06-13 12:06:34 People pray for cake but when the almighty gives them egg, butter, oil, batter, a pan & an oven they get frustrated & leave the kitchen
8019 2018-06-13 12:06:34 @realDonaldTrump @USHouseofReps @USSenate then please push some renewable energy incentives through Congress and reduce our oil dependency, it’ll create more jobs, stimulate the economy and we won’t be as reliant on OPEC #notrocketscience
8020 2018-06-13 12:06:29 Which country dictated the price of oil for almost 100 years?
8021 2018-06-13 12:06:26 Spoiler alert. Not sexy even if she was working the oil fracking towns.

8023 2018-06-13 12:06:20 @FerroTV, great push back against @tomkeene & Gartman on jawboning oil suppliers. #StayStrong
8024 2018-06-13 12:06:20 STFU. You did this by stirring up trouble in the Mid-East - breaking Iran Nuclear deal, moving the US Embassy in Israel, etc. Uncertainty leads to higher oil prices. Great for your rich cronies. Terrible for everyday Americans.
8025 2018-06-13 12:06:11 Yeah if only the threat of Iranian oil being sanctioned can be eliminated .. oh wait! Moron!
8026 2018-06-13 12:06:03 USA actually formed a Syndicate with Saudi to get Oil and one with Israel to help take revenge on their pass enemies. USA Paid Mercenaries to over throw Saddam, Gaddafi for Oil and Gold. Most Terrorists are from Saudi and Israel #SWaGodKing
8027 2018-06-13 12:05:58 Thank you, Mr. President! I cannot think of a single time when @BarackObama stood up even one time against the cartel when the oil price was over $110 p/b @CNN @riyasharma266 @Trunthepaige @CNBC @andrewrsorkin @JoeSquawk @FoxNews
8028 2018-06-13 12:05:56 Trump trade policies are sending prices of oil, gas, food, utilities SKY HIGH.
8029 2018-06-13 12:05:54 Oil went up as soon as you pulled out of the Iran deal and caused instability in the region. YOU are the reason everyone is now paying more for gas.
8030 2018-06-13 12:05:50 There’s your next challenge Mr. President! Show them how to correctly negotiate oil prices. I strongly believe this is a small challenge for you but I also believe you will take care of it!
8031 2018-06-13 12:05:48 Sir ... but you told our President @MBuhari that you are not interested in our oil why concern yourself with the high oil price again ... please all what my President want is high oil price so that our reserve can increase ...
8032 2018-06-13 12:05:42 Yes they are glad u noticed oil companies are sticking it to the American people for sure taking advantage of use
8033 2018-06-13 12:05:42 Oil prices are too high, OPEC is back. Not good!
8034 2018-06-13 12:05:32 Time to put tariffs on oil exports. Encourage oil co to increase gas production.

8037 2018-06-13 12:05:16 a Trump tweet is worth a thousand words...or is that spawns a thousand words. #MuchAdo #oil 
Does he have inside info on forthcoming #inventory data @EIAgov ?
8038 2018-06-13 12:05:13 LUMBER IS TOO HIGH TOO< you can actually do something about that by removing lumber tariffs! 
AND: 
The two primary factors that impact the price of oil are:
supply and demand
market sentiment

目の前で負傷してたからwwww
8040 2018-06-13 12:05:04 Wait till Canada gets through with you....you haven't begun to see high oil prices...
8041 2018-06-13 12:05:03 @realDonaldTrump are YOU nuts with that #oil Tweet?? U.S. producers barely make a profit at $65 oil and you want Saudi's/Iran/Russia to pump more so prices go down more?? 2014?

hey @HaroldHamm would you please talk to ur friend!

$xop $uso @WhiteHouse @PressSec @KellyannePolls
8042 2018-06-13 12:04:55 Amazing how oil goes up when summer comes along. As if they have no Refined gas in storage. # Rigged Game.
8043 2018-06-13 12:04:51 @realDonaldTrump '"Dream on your Snake Oil salesman''  Did Kim also sell you the Brooklyn Bridge?
8044 2018-06-13 12:04:51 Doesn't the US produce its own oil?? How much is that selling at?
8045 2018-06-13 12:04:49 I'm not a politician and nor am I in trade or finance, but here is what I feel..we have oil and gas, charge the #Americans for it, we have hydro that feeds their eastern seaboard, make them pay market price for it, or shut it down #HydroOne #OPG @cafreeland @JustinTrudeau
8046 2018-06-13 12:04:45 Nice bike dude! Get the oil changed in those marzocchi forks though - they'll go forever if you treat them right. Easy to do on them if you Google it.
8047 2018-06-13 12:04:42 RT realDonaldTrump: Oil prices are too high, OPEC is at it again. Not good!
8048 2018-06-13 12:04:39 This oil vouchers get ahead of themselves 
Most of times pure thievery
8049 2018-06-13 12:04:33 ...you do realize that oil prices started rising when YOU pulled out of the Iran deal? Yep, you did that
8050 2018-06-13 12:04:32 Too much to ask for you to incarcerate an oil executive for price gouging, I take it?
8051 2018-06-13 12:04:31 惚れましたお(*^^*)ケミかるさん企画もいつも面白くてしかも上手いなんて、せこい！w

8053 2018-06-13 12:04:19 Oil prices are just fine you fracking twat
8054 2018-06-13 12:04:18 You drove up oil prices when you quit the Iran deal. Not good!
8055 2018-06-13 12:04:14 Threatening sanctions (or worse) on a major oil producer, like Iran, can have that effect.
8056 2018-06-13 12:04:10 Oil prices also increased in pakistan

8058 2018-06-13 12:03:59 @realDonaldTrump that is because the American oil producers are not allowed to freely sell their product in America to American suppliers #MAGA
8059 2018-06-13 12:03:51 Dear mr. Trump I guess you don't like our oil RR water or Hydro I'm at a loss for words with you
8060 2018-06-13 12:03:46 Over the last 12 mths the demand for oil has grown by over 1.2 mill bbls/day. Supply has grown by only 0.5 mill bbls/day. We now have an undersupply gap of 0.6 mmbbls/day. Storage is now below the 5-yr avg. The economy is booming. We’re back in balance. Ain’t OPEC!
8061 2018-06-13 12:03:45 150 is good and there is nothing you can do .
Your taxing oil for the Americans 
Cut the tax on oil and gas !!!!!
8062 2018-06-13 12:03:39 Oil prices are growing in terms of supply and demand, or the military threat to the world (Sample: military threat to Russia at last time (now) grow).
8063 2018-06-13 12:03:38 @realDonaldTrump yes get those oil prices down I'm cold

だけかんがえてたら1日解けた
8066 2018-06-13 12:03:29 And local oil and gas companies are taking advantage to raise their prices!
8067 2018-06-13 12:03:27 Why would an American, unless you owned an oil Company complain about our president saying oil prices are too high? Grow Up!

8070 2018-06-13 12:03:20 The rules of market is built upon supply and demand. The gradual rise of oil prices represents the economy is on the rise as well.
8071 2018-06-13 12:03:13 With natural gas prices so low smaller domestic producers need a higher oil price to stay solvent or it will only be opec and large producers supplying.
8072 2018-06-13 12:03:12 oil prices are the low Don, Gas Prices are high, that's primarily why the US Dollar isn't worth anything... ;)
8073 2018-06-13 12:03:12 Your policies have pushed up prices and what do you understand about the economics of supply and demand in the Oil industry? About as much as you understand your role as president... so nothing.
8074 2018-06-13 12:03:10 無理はしてはだめだよ。休んでくれぃ
8075 2018-06-13 12:03:09 I'm at a very happy stage of my life where I have both average olive oil and really good olive oil!
8076 2018-06-13 12:03:07 Thanks to you. 
Where is all our domestic oil going?
8077 2018-06-13 12:03:06 Speak to the British.. Brent price controls price.. wait long enough and oil price would not be significant in EV world.. that's the future.. no question..
8078 2018-06-13 12:03:04 I can't oil paint, but I'm okay with watercolors. All the furniture and the hair are the same color for me
8079 2018-06-13 12:02:59 Donny, the only way to move toward lowering the burden of oil for energy is to cut its throat. This is why most forward-looking countries are moving toward alternate sustainable energy and electric vehicles. While you return to the coal and oil of the past.
8080 2018-06-13 12:02:55 Champignons! Oh yes, definitely aubergines remind of them when fried like this.
I adore almost all kinds of pasta haha But most of all pasta in butter or olive oil.
8081 2018-06-13 12:02:54 Oil prices are up because you killed the Iran deal.  #FlipTheHouse #IndictTrump
8082 2018-06-13 12:02:51 Slow your roll. Love, Texas RT @realDonaldTrump: Oil prices are too high, OPEC is at it again. Not good!
8083 2018-06-13 12:02:48 Seeing how u have oil people on your staff u could fix this problem!! How much do u make ? I'm sure u have stock in it !! Do something to change it ..prices are going up !
8084 2018-06-13 12:02:46 Trump do you just make up shit or are you this incompetent? Oil prices are down the past few week from almost $80 a barrel to $75.78 today. The chat is still that OPEC will do something at its June meeting in reaction to the looming prospect of a fall in crude prod. #TrumpIsALiar
8085 2018-06-13 12:02:44 How about a Federal capex initiative Manhatten Project size, to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and a Cyber protection initiative to protect all local, state, fed govts?  It doesn't have to be just for oil sake.
8086 2018-06-13 12:02:41 Anyone know much about, or fuck with CBD oil? Asking for a frie... Ok, it's for me.
8087 2018-06-13 12:02:36 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other.
8088 2018-06-13 12:02:36 Yes my president my friend I'm afraid these oil prices under the guise of them will try to stall our economic success I wish there was something that you could do but North American oil producers is the best remedy and I support you when hundred percent that we can X export more
8089 2018-06-13 12:02:34 You buy most of your oil from Canada, don't sweat it....oops.
8090 2018-06-13 12:02:34 Yes sir!  I am in the transportation industry and I can tell you that higher oil prices along with the new ELD mandate is unfairly burdening American businesses with MUCH higher freight costs.  It is HURTING American companies and consumers.  Something needs to be done! Ask me.
8091 2018-06-13 12:02:33 Gas and oil are too high. #ThanksTrump
8092 2018-06-13 12:02:32 We should be able to force sovereign countries to produce more oil like we force domestic cake makers to produce gay wedding cakes!  
8093 2018-06-13 12:02:32 Even if I had Saudi Arabian Oil Prince money I ain't buying headphones at the airport
8094 2018-06-13 12:02:22 As much oil we have here why do we need OPAC?
8095 2018-06-13 12:02:19 Remember when you said #Obama should be fired because of the oil prices? What’s your comment?
8096 2018-06-13 12:02:17 Yeah. If only some asshole hadn't walked away from the Iran nuclear deal, the price of oil might have remained stable.
8097 2018-06-13 12:02:14 not our business Let them strangulate EU China India etc.. we have oil for next 200 years Don't forget petrol has 90% petrochemicals & less than 10% energy that can be manufactured from palm oil like Total is doing
8098 2018-06-13 12:02:12 Oil prices are too high, OPEC is at it again. Not good!
8099 2018-06-13 12:02:12 メテノとネンドールの比較をしたことがある人間、存在するのか
8100 2018-06-13 12:02:06 We're feeling it at the pumps.  Is it too soon for U.S. oil production to be felt here at home?
8101 2018-06-13 12:02:05 Maybe if you hadn't thrown a little tantrum and backtracked on the US deal with Iran, the oil prices would have been more stable in that region. You are directly responsible for increased oil prices, and you alone. That's  new for a US "president."
8102 2018-06-13 12:02:05 @DrJenGunter 600 gullible people with $650 in LA isn't a stretch.   There should be a law suit available for "it doesn't work as promised" .   Her investors are likely the companies whose snake oil she shills.
8103 2018-06-13 12:02:04 planning my meals and trying to restrict for real has made me realise how things add up that i think mean nothing eg. marinades and oil and vinegar on salad
8104 2018-06-13 12:02:01 It should not be controversial to suggest that if oil made from hemp can dramatically improve a child's quality of life, maybe it shouldn't be illegal.
8105 2018-06-13 12:01:59 RT @realDonaldTrump: Oil prices are too high, OPEC is at it again. Not good!
8106 2018-06-13 12:01:59 The US is a net oil exporter. Why do OPEC prices concern you?
8107 2018-06-13 12:01:54 There's a 100% chance that 9 minutes ago, Fox and Friends blamed OPEC for high oil prices.
8108 2018-06-13 12:01:52 Your fault don't you remember the Iran shit you started.  Gas went up right after that.   Your oil buddies should do just fine that is the point right?
8109 2018-06-13 12:01:49 Hayley is a Blacker Hall Farm Shop in Wakefield today, come and have a taste of our amazing Cold Pressed Rapeseed Oil!
8110 2018-06-13 12:01:44 Thanks to you and backing out of an agreement.    Sanctions coming back so OIL is going to go up.
8111 2018-06-13 12:01:44 Trump accuses OPEC of raising oil prices
8112 2018-06-13 12:01:37 At what again? Some members said recently they would put more oil on the market after speaking to you, didn't they?
8113 2018-06-13 12:01:37 We need more control over crude oil costs high fuel prices hurt all Americans
8114 2018-06-13 12:01:36 Yes! Very high oil prices!
8115 2018-06-13 12:01:34 Yes but Putin wants high oil prices and also the president of Israel.
8116 2018-06-13 12:01:32 Dude just blow something up at home, blame it on a country with oil as a natural resource and brown people as it’s indigenous, invade said shithole, barrel up the oil throw up a sweet new pipe, hey presto cheaper gas for our kick ass V8’s   
8117 2018-06-13 12:01:32 Oil prices are high partly because you teared up the Iranian deal, therefore raising the tensions in the region. But it's always someone else's fault, right?
8118 2018-06-13 12:01:31 damn right u are! They shouldnt have this kinda control and why cant OIL be with fixed price? EU 1 liter costs 1.4-1.6euros..and it wont go down just up..not like you need to worry about EU but im just sayin..Take em down!
8119 2018-06-13 12:01:19 The market...You know... Economic growth leads to higher consumption of oil and higher prices ... But maybe it´is to difficult to understand.
- Oh I have got an idea! How about bombing Iran?

8121 2018-06-13 12:01:12 Mr. President,  please make the oil prices lower. We beg you.
8122 2018-06-13 12:01:10 I get it. You havnt looked up "pettyfogging" yet so you dont realise why your point on "contracts" is assine.

Look it up.

And who exactly do you think receives Libya's oil related taxes? Which faction?
8123 2018-06-13 12:01:08 On the contrary. It’s very good. Why should US get cheap oil from overseas?
8124 2018-06-13 12:01:08 Oil prices are too high, OPEC is at it again. Not good!
8125 2018-06-13 12:01:07 How can oil prices be too high for the USA?  You recently declared your great achievement of making the USA a net exporter of energy so high world prices should be a good thing for the USA.

Or was that just another of your many lies?
8126 2018-06-13 12:01:06 why gas keeps going up is because majority of the house own stock in it and the other point is most of your companies that produce oil are owned by liberals and the Liberals are trying to make it's so bad that you will vote Democrat just another sneaky ploy to get votes
8127 2018-06-13 12:00:58 Might be time to reduce your carbon emissions, higher oil price might do just that for you.
8128 2018-06-13 12:00:57 Trump's vehemently against high oil prices, the lifeline of our economy. But I have some simpletons in Nigeria who, for reasons best known to themselves, consider him worthy of admiration. This is, of course, aside from his anti-immigration stance which doesn't favour us.
8129 2018-06-13 12:00:56 You’re at it again. Oil prices are down over 10% in the last 6 weeks. You have no clue what you’re talking about, as usual. Just a new vector to disrupt our country and distract from the criminal chaos in your administration. #comradecriminal
8130 2018-06-13 12:00:55 Oil prices under Obama were G R E A T.  Thanks for f’ing that up too!!
8131 2018-06-13 12:00:47 Maybe if you didn’t charge the Saudis and the Qataris such stiff prices for the  buildings and appartments they buy from your family and you, they wouldn’t need to keep oil prices so high?
8132 2018-06-13 12:00:46 Whip together 4 1/2 tbsps daily bread with 8 oz bread. Blend with Olive Oil. Drain through cheesecloth Serve the next morning for breakfast.
8133 2018-06-13 12:00:44 Apparently there’s some tool that our mechanic uses to stick those on. I always end up waiting until an oil change because my nurse OCD with my postpartum OCD ...
8134 2018-06-13 12:00:43 Your sanctions on Iran drove the prices of oil up. Prices were much cheaper under Obama
8135 2018-06-13 12:00:41 War games, #WorldCup, #OPEC and oil prices. @realDonaldTrump very busy this morning
8136 2018-06-13 12:00:39 Open up the drilling and take the cuffs off American oil producers and watch the prices fall.
8137 2018-06-13 12:00:38 OPEC blows .. agreed, But actions have consequences, breaking the Iran deal  and Embassy move to Jerusalem were great for your base, but not great for oil prices.. Go to Amazon and get International Economics for Dummies, it will help.
8138 2018-06-13 12:00:37 13:28 Now learn a parable unto us, and the anointing oil, and pour out my spirit was refreshed by you into the great waters were a great anger.

8142 2018-06-13 12:00:18 Dear Diary, Oil prices are too high, OPEC is at it again. Not good!
8143 2018-06-13 12:00:14 Oil prices are too high, because I am a Moron and OPEC and Putin (very good friend) know it!  Not good!
8144 2018-06-13 12:00:13 We need more infrastructure for oil transportation along with increased tax credits for those that shift away from home heating oil
8145 2018-06-13 12:00:12 Stay out of it before you destroy that too. You don't have the intelligence to comment on oil prices as its complicated, above your head!!!!
8146 2018-06-13 12:00:08 Let’s give an economics lesson: When you reverse legislation aimed at making cars more efficient (and reducing emissions), oil demand goes down, prices go down. When car companies can throw efficiency to the wind, oil futures go up (that means demand will go up), prices go up
8147 2018-06-13 12:00:07 Oil prices are too high, OPEC is at it again. Not good!

8151 2018-06-13 11:59:54 Oil prices are too high because we have a fucking idiot in the White Hiuse

8154 2018-06-13 11:59:45 No dumb dumb this is bc of you pulling out of the Iran deal. I thought the US was producing oil at record heights.
8155 2018-06-13 11:59:44 Hi. I don’t have olive oil i have brazilian hair oil will it still work?
8156 2018-06-13 11:59:41 @RoKhanna the USA should not be in the middle east AT ALL! Work needs to happen here in the USA! Start with the fake war on drugs, those resources can be used on more education along with affordable rehab! War on drugs JOKE, MIDDLE EAST OCCUPATION, oil joke!
8157 2018-06-13 11:59:33 A jury in Anchorage, Alaska, blames recklessness by Exxon and Captain Joseph Hazelwood for the Exxon Valdez disaster, allowing victims of the oil spill to seek $15 billion in damages.1994
8158 2018-06-13 11:59:29 He loves dictators because he wants to be one. Remember Congress, they are just a necessary nuisance to him. Probably just a preamble to “fire and fury”, then he can say, “I tried”. Then the richest Republicans can make oodles of oil and military money. Smoke and mirrors. U hot!

With you being stupidly happy with it!

Suck it up!
Dotard Trump!
8162 2018-06-13 11:59:14 Which is why we should invest in alternative energy sources like solar and wind to reduce reliance on oil.
8163 2018-06-13 11:59:14 Never thought I would say this, but Erin Burnett is now considered scum in my opinion. CNN has ruined a solid, likable female anchor. So long ago are the fun CNBC days. Now a CNN Fake News puppet. @CNBCnow @cnbc @carlquintanilla @JoeSquawk
8164 2018-06-13 11:59:12 Isn't is time to have a DRAWDOWN & SALE of some DOE, Strategic Petroleum Reserve OIL RESERVES to show OPEC we can be totally oil INDEPENDENT without their extortion? Oil Prices will stabilize immediately!
8165 2018-06-13 11:59:10 HOY NAA OY! E CHANGE OIL GD NANG ULO NIMO 
8166 2018-06-13 11:59:03 It’s your fault.  Fucking with Iran and created a target for future military action to distract from your treason = increased oil prices.
8167 2018-06-13 11:58:53 They have the oil. You want the oil. They set the prices. Gosh, there's that "free hand of the market" at work. Hurts, don't it.

8171 2018-06-13 11:58:45 Oil prices are too high, because your illegitimate, stolen presidency s*cks bigly!
8172 2018-06-13 11:58:41 This is in direct response to you backing out of the Iran deal, and imposing sanctions on them.  Now they have all of their money back, and don't have to agree to inspections, AND are raising the prices of oil. 

This. Is. Your. Doing.  

This. Is. Your. Fault!
8173 2018-06-13 11:58:39 You do realize that several states in your own country rely on oil for their economies, the higher the price the better the economy is doing, the more people are working.  Think before you speak
8174 2018-06-13 11:58:34 realDonaldTrump:

8175 2018-06-13 11:58:31 What about oil, water, pot, gas even the spoon to turn it?
8176 2018-06-13 11:58:30 If you really care maybe you shouldn't have:

- killed Obama's fuel emission standards

- killed the Iran deal

- killed clean energy development/investment

but hey, as long as big oil, big donors, the Saudis and the Russians make some cash it's all good, right?
8177 2018-06-13 11:58:30 Crude oil prices up, too many things are made out of plastics, causes demand from oil that takes away from oil for fuel. Reduce virgin plastic, use Glass, Aluminum or Tin etc. Lower the fuel tax rate in every state.

8185 2018-06-13 11:58:20 The oil price increases are a direct results of your actions. The withdrawal from the Iran deal, and the relocation of the US embassy to Jerusalem. Both destabilizing actions in the Middle East.
8186 2018-06-13 11:58:16 World peace and oil prices in the one week, gaun yersel donald
8187 2018-06-13 11:58:15 We in India agree with you. It's a big issue here as we have to import all our oil and gas from OPEC.
8188 2018-06-13 11:58:13 Then let's switch to domestic oil until they lower the prices. We need to stop relying on OPEC to control our oil Market.
8189 2018-06-13 11:58:13 Sir, talk about Oil prices..
8190 2018-06-13 11:58:09 No problem, just sign another EXECUTIVE ORDER to reduce oil prices! But wait, US is largest producer of oil.... You need more sleep. Still in jet lag!?

8200 2018-06-13 11:57:50 Does Trump lose his touch? oil prices are not reacting to his tweets
8201 2018-06-13 11:57:49 Reminder that the Trump admin has completely paved the way for oil companies to do whatever the fuck they want with barely any regulations. Who thought they would want more money?

8204 2018-06-13 11:57:38 No sir, BEE is a good a idea, problem is failure to implement it correctly and it’s been hijacked by the hyenas. 

The UAE and Qatar both have a form of BEE ( Emeratization and Qatarization), it works perfectly and empowers locals who were left behind by the oil wealth boom.
8205 2018-06-13 11:57:37 one of my aunts said that biore pore strips or a blackhead mask gel will remove the poison ivy oil completely....but she's like the only person I know who would have extras of those things. I guess they absorb the oil so you can toss it out

8207 2018-06-13 11:57:31 America needs to keep its oil here. Why do we export oil and then import it? Only export what we don't need. We don't need OPEC.
8208 2018-06-13 11:57:30 It will be cheaper if the United States increases oil production.

8244 2018-06-13 11:56:33 Just bomb them and take the oil
8245 2018-06-13 11:56:31 I know, why don't you try a tariff on Cruse oil.  If that doesn't work, you can try insulting the Saudi and Iraqi leaders.  If they give you lip, go negotiate with Venezuela.

8281 2018-06-13 11:55:49 No actually it's our government not you president Donald Trump but the background government and you know what I'm talking about that's who raised the prices because we got enough oil the last for 300 years as we stand right now
8282 2018-06-13 11:55:48 But we still have Russian oil...

8284 2018-06-13 11:55:43 Oil is to high. This should not be. Do whatever it is that you do to make it come way down. Would love to see gas prices come down a dollar a gallon again.
8285 2018-06-13 11:55:43 Umm, dafuq does OPEC have to do with US oil prices anymore?  Are you stuck in the 70s?  Oil prices are high in the US because of your rich buddies are raping us.
8286 2018-06-13 11:55:42 yeah. no shit genius...

but OPEC doesn't supply the majority of our oil... we do.
8287 2018-06-13 11:55:39 Ummm check the USA surplus, maybe get crazy and release that. Maybe investigate why USA oil companies keep reporting record earnings while oil prices keep climbing. Oh never mind you only want to HELP them make more money and take from US citizens

8429 2018-06-13 11:48:46 The #exploitation of #oil and #coal, and now #naturalgas, is only exceeded by #war as a maker of #financial #fortunes. There is no way that these people intend to allow a little thing like #roasting the #planet to #interfere with their god-like #status. Never, ever. Uh uh.
8430 2018-06-13 11:48:37 Ermmm. Ok. Now apply same logic to every ICE car made, every HGV made to transport fuel to forecourts, every oil refinery DAILY useage of CO2 (eye watering!), and average extra CO2 produced accross world daily by each ICE vehicle. Of course EVs are ultra low @FullyChargedDan
8431 2018-06-13 11:48:11 Why does rosehip oil smell like fish oil???
8432 2018-06-13 11:47:50 What we should be concerned with is whether the full quantity (500,000 ) liters was supplied and was the price inflated. Otherwise in whatever circumstances, NYS would still have purchased fuel either directly from an oil company or a trader.

8488 2018-06-13 11:39:18 If we nationalized big oil, we’d be doing them a favor. Once legit carbon taxes are implemented they’re going to go bankrupt. Or, even if we fail to implement carbon taxes, within 15 years renewables will be killing them off. Nationalization would be bad.
8489 2018-06-13 11:39:16 Qatar has a shitload of money to spend (oil money), it is basically countrie's propaganda. That bid is still controversial. You can look up John Oliver's episodes on FIFA to catch a glimpse on how difficult could be for a country to held a WC.

8498 2018-06-13 11:37:49 I’d bet cars would be expensive regardless of regulations.

They forget that safety regulations were developed because consumers were getting injured, and it became a public health concern. Fuel efficiency standards were developed largely because of the oil embargo in the 1970’s.

8570 2018-06-13 11:22:25 @realDonaldTrump My Dad once said on name calling - if you do, there's no difference between the two of you. Know when to ignore and when to walk away. The squeaky wheel does not always get the oil and will stay squeaky.
8571 2018-06-13 11:22:23 The Fractional Distillation question? I said that fuel oil (I think) was the one that should be cracked. (It was the one with the largest white bar)
8572 2018-06-13 11:22:23 Venezuela esta así porque solo se dedicó a una base en su economía, y esa es la del Petróleo. Nuestra economía esta encaminada también al OIL AND GAS y la crisis de hace unos años dejo muy mal parado al país. Ya estamos avisados y lo que queremos es cambiar.
8573 2018-06-13 11:22:22 @RealMediaCrooks : $35 billion is non-oil trade between India & UAE , India is the second largest direct investor in the UAE at the end of 2016 with $6.6 billion. Time to stop our dependency on OIL and start moving towards electronic vehicles.

8703 2018-06-13 10:59:17 Does my sassiness upset you?
Why are you beset with gloom?
’Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
Pumping in my living room.

You may write me down in history
With your bitter, twisted lies,
You may trod me in the very dirt
But still, like dust, I'll rise.

8783 2018-06-13 10:45:19 Best way to avoid recession is for oil prices to tank and for inflation and rates to remain low. I didn't think for one second that US will go into recession in 2016. Also we were going to elect a more pro-business president than Obama. Hard to see the recession case then.

Geopolitics is only fear & money.

8853 2018-06-13 10:32:56 Side note - I worked for an employer installing solar at one point. And yep, the dude who was my boss there was a toxic asshole too. Left within a week of starting that job (was after I'd done my dash with oil & gas / mining)
8854 2018-06-13 10:32:42 . When I say Oil change I mean JUST OIL CHANGE. You people be giving chest pains everyday.

8880 2018-06-13 10:27:02 10k is to put it lightly so it doesn't look like I'm exaggerating. What do I do on my phone that I'll spend more than 10k in a month? Do I use it for work? Nooo, do I watch videos on YouTube? Nooo it's not worth it. I'm not an oil worker neither am I the daughter of a politician
8881 2018-06-13 10:26:45 Yeah.. mixed it up

8883 2018-06-13 10:26:33 Don’t get me wrong. I’m actually an advocate of the technology. It’s just that other than the base use-cases, everything else has been snake oil or scams. Is it possible to be a skeptical advocate? :)

8888 2018-06-13 10:25:50 I have trouble believing them and it is so beguiling but sustainable tends to be greenwash speak. I suspect some of the NGO's out there are funded by palm oil companies hence the odd reaction to Iceland stores announcement.
8889 2018-06-13 10:25:39 NOBODY IS TELLING THE TRUTH ABOUT OUR HEALTH

OIL IS FOR SQEAKY WHEELS, LIGHTING LAMPS AN TOPICALS

DO NOT EAT OIL OF ANY KIND IT IS KILLING YOU

a 110 marathon runner puts oil on their salad..a 300lb person eats fried chicken

BOTH GET CANCER OR HEART ATTACKS

It is not GENETIC
8890 2018-06-13 10:25:29 2. Nigeria is in no way comparable to KSA. KSA wholly controls and owns its oil resources through Aramco. Nigeria's oil resources are controlled by western companies such as Shell.
8891 2018-06-13 10:25:19 Compare crude oil price
8892 2018-06-13 10:25:12 
8893 2018-06-13 10:25:07 I mean it's clearly a society wide issue, though I'd probably be willing to take the wager that while Green Energy is probably as bad as most sectors of society, Oil & Gas is far worse for it than society on a whole. My experience of the industry was toxic masculinity run wild...
8894 2018-06-13 10:24:59 It's down to the dollar exchange rate, oil prices and tax. Mostly tax.

8909 2018-06-13 10:20:57 ପୂରା ଠିକ। Local mustard oil has actually less fat but it was propagated as if it has more fat and not good for health. And then slowly everyone from city to village started using refined oil. 
Marketing techniques.

8917 2018-06-13 10:19:27 I know that's on a different front than the misogyny and racism problems in the oil and gas boys game (yeh, I worked in it for a while too and apparently I was too progressive for most of those blokes).... Both are good reasons for women to avoid the industry.
8918 2018-06-13 10:19:13 India"s May oil demand hs been moderated to 3.4%YOY on d bk of high base effect of 6.9% May17'. Subdued diesel demand of 0.3% led a decline in oil demand (8.2%YOY in May17'). Gasoline demand was 2% as against 15.7% May17'. India's oil demand growth is expected to stabilize at 5%.
8919 2018-06-13 10:19:12 “Wealth generation” has largely been based on the ownership of natural resources such as oil, gas, gold, diamonds, platinum... Soon, it will be water.

8965 2018-06-13 10:08:59 they have million faults but using oil to their advantage is definitely not one of them. rather seeing conditions of Iran Nigeria and Venezuela, wouldn't be wrong to say they use oil very prudently
8966 2018-06-13 10:08:49 There’s a whole lot of lobbyists swinging in the wind now that National are opposition.

Transitioning away from fossil fuels going to take 30 years (until current oil & gas permits expire), so net zero emissions targets reflect that reality.

8976 2018-06-13 10:07:07 Vlad the Ay-rab has to raise the oil prices to grease the palms of his oligarchs and stick his beak in deep enough to take half the profits. So life on earth ends— so what? He’ll be dead, too. Russia, is this the best you can do? A gangster and thug?

8979 2018-06-13 10:04:23 I have just seen liquified petroleum gas (LPG) being described as 'low carbon heating'.

But its only 12% lower than heating oil according to the industry's own literature.

It is absolutely not 'low carbon'.

9003 2018-06-13 09:59:03 Article in FT today highlights that the country that would be benefit most from oil rising to $100 a barrel is Russia. Geopolitical unrest = higher oil prices. Go figure.

9008 2018-06-13 09:56:54 Uhhh...W was also a business man and CEO of an oil company.  The Rangers were a $250 million organization when he ran them.  He was also governor of a state that, by itself, is the world's 14th largest economy.

Not a big Bush fan myself, but get your facts straight.

9015 2018-06-13 09:56:03 You don't need contracts to extract oil. You need licences which the government grants.

9018 2018-06-13 09:55:25 Bernstein the latest aboard $100 oil bandwagon. Says with inventories now at a 3-year low and expectations for further declines, $100/bbl oil "doesn’t feel that crazy now."

#OOTT
9019 2018-06-13 09:55:24 DO NOT EAT OIL

It is a HIGH concentrate & always intoxicates the body

Oil is NOT a soluble & traps other toxins, sugars, salt..

WATER & OIL DO NOT MIX

Oil in the blood thickens & cause the heart to work harder & enlarge

The trap items in the blood scratch & tear the arteries

9047 2018-06-13 09:49:54 I think it is undoubted that the future roles of oil & gas must change, but a "decline" in numbers used for this & that, need not represent a decline in usefulness & profitability of a fundamental commodity in a whole variety of contexts. Decline is in the eye of the beholder :-)

9050 2018-06-13 09:49:26 Yes, hydrocarbons recycled as energy (to run the plant in effect) which buys us more time to develop renewable energy.

Realistically this is better than burying it and digging up & transporting more oil (which is terrifically polluting in of itself) which we then burn anyway...

9120 2018-06-13 09:37:15 Under the SNP it will never happen.... up to you how you interpret that, devomax, eu, lead not leave, oil drying up..... cmon why are u avoiding it?? Are you shitting it or are u one of the peeeeol who blindly follow...
9121 2018-06-13 09:36:43 I may be missing something here, but is this not just doing to increase CO2 emissions? You're surely liberating even more carbon from the oil sink into the atmosphere.

9123 2018-06-13 09:36:33 Messiah translates into “anointed one.”

Only priests (and kings like David) were literally anointed by placing drop of oil on their head.

9125 2018-06-13 09:35:59 Hope the EU will do!!! The regions after Palm oil are deserts....the companies and traders are rich and the farmers remain poor but now have to live in an enviromental desaster...yes EU ban this as fast as possible #EU #PalmOil #ban
9126 2018-06-13 09:35:59 Oil change today
9127 2018-06-13 09:35:31 Actually this can become an exportable product, eventually Oil’s supply will drop, demand will go up, price as well. And all the countries relying on fossil fuels will import electricity. Now if we are ahead of all other nations, then we gain profit.

9149 2018-06-13 09:31:27 No need to burn it as it can be converted into oil and diesel (google oil from plastic waste) without the toxic fumes you’d get from burning.
I seem to remember someone flying a plane  across (part of) Australia on fuel from this.
I think it’s pretty new though.

9182 2018-06-13 09:26:43 You guys are lucky nobody makes you admit that when you say "clean energy" you actually mean carbon capture utilization and storage.

9221 2018-06-13 09:17:22 LOL. You obviously do not know how much oil is pumped a day in the world and how little 1.55M is. You belief that because oil goes up that people will buy a new car instead of driving less or eating the difference. Yet how this has anything to do with Tesla.
9222 2018-06-13 09:16:58 Its the same issue, take into consideration less prices of oil and more then double circular debt.

9258 2018-06-13 09:12:40 Long-term sustainable? As in, in 200 million years time given favourable conditions, nature will make more oil. Yes, in that way I suppose it is sustainable.
9259 2018-06-13 09:12:22 Do I really need to explain that? Higher Oil prices=higher request for EV=higher request for EVs=higher $TSLA share price
9260 2018-06-13 09:12:17 This is for 2 mobile contracts. PAC or OIL Code I simply want to pay the bills...get the codes & leave your dreadful company yet I'm being blocked from doing so. WHY
9261 2018-06-13 09:12:11 If we just burnt plastic waste as fuel instead of spending money on convoluted recycling schemes, then we would simply be completing the oil fuel cycle, but will have extracted extra utility from it first...

9270 2018-06-13 09:11:27 The point is if getting oil to the western/asian markets was so important for Alberta then why did an Alberta PM not get it built? He spent years and years trying to get Keystone built. Putting more eggs into one basket. He didn't do enough and now its all Trudeau's fault? Nope.

9682 2018-06-13 07:53:56 I was told today by a psychiatrist that the reason why I’ve been depressed, suicidal, anxiety filled and have had joint issues for the last 10 years of my life was because I’m vegan (for the last 3/4 years of my life) and don’t take fish oil :-) 
Lol ok  that adds up.

Question marks over global economic growth, and resulting oil demand, as well as over US producers’ capacity to pump oil at an ever faster pace!
9742 2018-06-13 07:40:14 While US & UK support the evil cruelty of starvation and bombing of Yemen, Twitter endlessly promotes video war games. Just to glorify and normalize killing and warfare. Hey, if it means acquiring money, power, land, oil, anything goes. Spite and greed rule.

9748 2018-06-13 07:37:38 For me sugar is not that big problem. Dates and raisins are 60% sugar on its own, where consumed for thousands of years and one can survive for years eating just dates. What is evil is snacks with both added oil and sugar or those that mix raisins and nuts.

9790 2018-06-13 07:30:32 3.) Use coconut oil. Due to the lauric, caprylic and capric acid found in coconut oil, it makes an excellent cream to help diminish acne scars. Coconut oil also helps to prevent new acne scars from forming. To fade acne scars, massage coconut oil into the affected area.

9816 2018-06-13 07:23:54 The Home Office saying CBD oil is a banned substance? If it simply contains CBD from cannabis it is not illegal. Under current law if it also contains THC then it is not legal. They (and/or @guardian) show their ignorance by omitting the detail.

9866 2018-06-13 07:14:39 Until the grant of special status to Lagos, this in principle, would be helpful to Lagos seeing that a good chunk of CIT comes from Lagos but that will leave states without oil, high level of formal commercial activities and population even poorer if their IGR doesn’t improve.
9867 2018-06-13 07:14:26 Clueless folk on here claiming to know about oil production.   30-40% of 28,000 barrels of frac water needs cleared before hydrocarbons will show.

My view on this is that the Government really wants fracking, nuclear and North Sea oil but also wants to 'be seen' to be with the gang on renewables, thus its content to deploy some renewables while firmly stamping down on others and restraining them generally

9935 2018-06-13 06:58:24 Bureaucracy gone mad!  Child's #Epilepsy medication removed abruptly, putting him in a life threatening condition because it is #cannabis oil. #BBC1 just now.
9936 2018-06-13 06:58:18 needs to happen...rising oil priced only help the russians
9937 2018-06-13 06:58:10 we did discuss whether to include interconnectors but oil is still used to generate leccy is some parts of world and fusion is getting $$$ at ITER and a "hope" for 21C. DSR covered by EE? Plus we only had 16 choices due to WC format, Plus it's just a bit of fun :-)
9938 2018-06-13 06:58:00 Being proud of one's origin is one thing, we all feel a little nationalism at times, such as the olympics. However, chauvinism is the repulsive (to me) believe that your country and its people are the absolute best. That's just stupid.
9939 2018-06-13 06:57:59 I can confirm that olive oil is awful, if it stains your clothes it's going to stay there FOREVER unless you use the right metod to clean it right away T__T
9940 2018-06-13 06:57:11 After the grand success of use and throw pens, tata motors have adopted this technique with their cars tata zest only after 1L kms is ready to be thrown, claiming to be strong and tough diesel engine it will stop pumping oil in its cylinder after 1L km with no reason @TataMotors
9941 2018-06-13 06:57:06 That line, while attractive, holds only if cutting that production implies a commensurate reduction in the world's oil use for fuel. (It almost certainly doesn't.) Better to look at more cost-effective ways of achieving reductions.
9942 2018-06-13 06:56:53 Those were some good days. We killed so many grams of oil

9949 2018-06-13 06:55:09 @NickHurdUK sort out this appalling mess regarding Billy Caldwell’s cannabis oil! Unless you are removing morphine etc from the meds menu, it is nonsensical and illogical! This child needs your help NOW! The public do not seem to support your stance! @theresa_may where are you?
9950 2018-06-13 06:54:45 iya itu juga lah susah betul apalagi sehari2 masak lauk ya mesti goreng tahu tempe telur dll :)) pake olive oil biar ngga merasa bersalah -_- HPL ku kata dokter 11 okt ni. Jangan2 emang deketan 
9951 2018-06-13 06:54:37 Now that my hair is long again, I've gone to the natural oil treatment once again. 3 days without shampoo to 1 day with, plus conditioner. I have to say. I hate washing my hair now. It looks so much better when I dont.
9952 2018-06-13 06:54:33 i mean hash oil, hash browns, same shit
9953 2018-06-13 06:54:18 1/ The democratically elected leader in 53 was overthrown, due to US and UK not liking him nationalising oil for Iran’s own benefit. The US should stop interfering in the ME there is always terrible blowback. No one objective seriously believes that the US or Israel bombing Iran
9954 2018-06-13 06:54:15 A pea-sized amount of baby oil can act as a shine hair serum before dashing out the door.
9955 2018-06-13 06:53:50 For me, its the taste. I think you're right. The butter/oil adds to the usual egg taste and it lacks that
9956 2018-06-13 06:53:36 Complex, messy, tangled human interaction is the new oil
9957 2018-06-13 06:53:16 Just now i have purchased sugar 1 kg, wheat 1 kg, T.dhall 1kg, p.oil 1 kg, r.rice 5 kg & b.rice 10 kg from fair price shop to my smart ration card in my village.
9958 2018-06-13 06:53:01 Don’t make your child ask,“What was oil?”. Conserve today!

9959 2018-06-13 06:52:58 The decision by Hurd to stop Billy Caldwell's anti-epileptic medication is disgraceful. He is not a dr, nor, it seems, a compassionate individual. This child wad prescribed the cannabis oil by a neurological expert. Does he know better? The man should hang his head in shame
9960 2018-06-13 06:52:49 Neutrogena best. Jangan pakai baby oil kalau taknak pores tersumbat 
9961 2018-06-13 06:52:49 Texas subsidizes its universities etc by selling oil on state land

9965 2018-06-13 06:51:48 Norway (some, not vast) Sweden, nope, Denmark, nope, Finland, nope. USA has oil, it subsidises you, no? Or in that different? Still waiting on examples...

9967 2018-06-13 06:51:31 Yes I grow olives & produce cold pressed xtra v oil. Not enough to sell unfortunately. We bring home oil to Ed every Dec & I will add you to our 'gift' list, hoping  for good harvest 
9968 2018-06-13 06:51:21 @WHAS11  senator grassley is trying to add an amendment to the fed. farm bill that would end Extract Wellness and others ability to produce and sell cbd hemp oil. he's trying for a vote today. please cover this to alert kyanna to call their senators to protect their access.
9969 2018-06-13 06:51:19 Interesting that cannabis oil cannot be patented by
Big Pharma and so remains an illegal substance.
9970 2018-06-13 06:51:17 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪
9971 2018-06-13 06:50:45 You advocate this yet fail to look at the bigger picture that products using palm oil provide starving communities with jobs and failing restaurants to be profitable.
9972 2018-06-13 06:50:23 You're a homeopath. You sell people water as medical intervention. Please, feel free to criticise the medical profession when you've stopped acting like a snake oil salesman.
9973 2018-06-13 06:49:59 1c/In 2014 pharmaceutical companies and their lobbying groups spent over $229 million influencing politicians and lawmakers. This industries lobbyists out spend defense contractors and the oil and gas industry.
9974 2018-06-13 06:49:46 At the moment for you to be my was my complete focus. during time the ticks told me it has a potion.  Shared a love and hate relationship with the back and forth motion. There was I leaking out my feelings like a oil spill.. the color of the water was her emotions.

9981 2018-06-13 06:48:30 35,000 in ‘division 3’ ( look it up ), full stadium! Funnily enough Man City supporters are some of the most loyal in the country! As you’ll clearly mention shortly, we don’t always have a full stadium as the oil money didn’t bring Irish and other nationalities into our fan base
9982 2018-06-13 06:48:25 We can also reduce edible oil import bill.
9983 2018-06-13 06:48:02 Have you an EY link ? What’s the growth figure including oil related activity?
9984 2018-06-13 06:47:51 In Gujarat, mostly in Kathiyawad, we prepare kobi no sambharo: coarsely cut cabbage is temepred in oil, hing, mustard seeds, a small pinch of turmeric and salt. Chopped green chillies are also added. It is semi cooked to maintain crunchiness and chewability. Eaten as side dish.

The #2019loancharge & it's retrospective nature will hit #NHS ,  oil rig, fishermen, engineers, IT etc. With many facing bankruptcy. We need @theSNP support.
9991 2018-06-13 06:47:18 Just be careful as not all #Lindt is palm oil free unfortunately. #saynotopalmoil
9992 2018-06-13 06:47:02 It’s just that he likes fucking with people—he had this running gag with baby oil all week and built up to peanut butter as a punchline
9993 2018-06-13 06:46:41 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
9994 2018-06-13 06:46:16 Nordic countries own & sell vast oil reserves which, as the middle east subsidizes their lives. Look it up

9996 2018-06-13 06:45:43 Thank you dear, I just worry the voices in my head don't normally do impressions. It could be me burning the midnight oil trying to get this book finished though.

9999 2018-06-13 06:44:40 @BBCBreaking please be clear in you "cannabis" coverage. Cannabis oil IS NOT banned in the UK. 
CBD is legal, it's THC that's illegal.

10001 2018-06-13 06:44:09 That wasn't just oil, was it? Because ordinary oil shouldn't be acidic - at least not enough to burn your skin enough to leave wholes
