Who lied about Stormy Daniels; separated kids from their parents and put them in cages; denigrated our allies and supported Russia; gave tax cuts to the rich; developed cheap insurance plans that cover nothing; drove commodities up with trade wars; etc! YOU did!
3 2018-08-28 23:35:54 When supplies are tight or in wartime they can ration commodities. This is all paid by us as socialism. But we never use that word cause it’s evil and stupid. But it works on a limited basis, under strict controls. And never, ever call it that. It’s capitalism, always.

40 2018-08-28 21:52:05 "When will people just mind their own fucking business and let me sell my neighbors into indentured servitude like the commodities they are for fucks sake?"
41 2018-08-28 21:39:37 They're people, not commodities.
42 2018-08-28 21:28:55 Others call it a proper league with proper supporters who aren't treated like commodities.
43 2018-08-28 21:28:27 First notice day selling on #grains. Fundamentals positive on #wheat and #corn with #soybeans being negative. Large supply selling in #livestock. #China #Mexico #Trump
44 2018-08-28 21:15:02 It’s all a balance. You draft well and build organizational depth so you can plunk money into known commodities.
45 2018-08-28 21:14:35 Poorer now than before current regime... income has been stagnant but prices of almost all commodities have gone up by at least 10%; fat worse is the FACT THAT ONLY THE RICH ARE GETTING RICHER BECAUSE OF THE GOP TAXCUT LAW WHICH HAS INCREASED THEIR  NET INCOME BY SO MUCH MORE???
46 2018-08-28 20:53:29 These people know they won’t have commodities or staples provided by U.K. This will be same all over EU it’s gonna be rough for these countries But they just ignore facts to their peril
47 2018-08-28 20:46:32 Commodities: Rubber -2.58%
Top commodity losers are Rubber (-2.58%) and Orange Juice (-2.37%). Gains are led by Lumber (1.81%), Palm Oil (1.06%) and Rice (0.76%).
48 2018-08-28 20:39:40 Isn't all value subjective and aren't all commodities a form of tender? I understand that gold IS money but, until electronic circuitry, what was the inherent value? Was it just representative of work and fairly rare?
49 2018-08-28 20:33:06 Eso, como dijo Adrián, te explica el fiscal. El comercial es mitad flotación mitad precios de commodities. Pero la cuestión es que el dólar flotaba y nadie se moría.
50 2018-08-28 20:26:08 It's a vampire economy -- everything you have goes to bankers and investors, rather than to the purchase of commodities you need, which would stimulate demand. It's Keynsian econ 101, which the current crop of politicos and econ academy has forgotten.
51 2018-08-28 20:22:45 Hard goods currently and mainly FMCG for the others 15 year. manufacturing in electronics and other categories. Spent a number of years also arbitraging volumes of consumer computer commodities. Across almost  every border. Why?
52 2018-08-28 20:13:14 thing is crypto is not a traditional market there are no closes like equities, commodities, FX.gaps in crypto aren't respected if anything at all. US futures volume is absurdly low no one respectable trades off those charts.BTC gaps being filled is just correlation, not causation
53 2018-08-28 20:12:07 Lo que deben identificar son las estrategias para que el País sea el beneficiario por los commodities que éstos representan. Es un asalto al País, debemos de cambiar y pensar más en Intro.

55 2018-08-28 20:08:16 I wonder if Maher owns any stocks or commodities? Perhaps he should forfeit all earned during the last 18-20 months. Or at the very least, he should donate these proceeds or his salary to a charity of his choice. Sound familiar, Maher? MAGA

60 2018-08-28 19:40:40 There's nothing revolutionary about doing drugs, they make you addicted to capitalist commodities.
61 2018-08-28 19:39:25 Supply management creates a stable agriculture industry for 5 commodities without any government subsidies! It supports family farms, a stable living (eg. look @ the AB pork industry), local production and efficient use of resources. Retailers set the price in stores, not farmers

63 2018-08-28 19:38:04 when commodities came out of a cyclical low in 2003 and I started to hear them referred to as investments I was incredulous.
64 2018-08-28 19:37:03 Soybeans have meet a objective of 835 a bushel and filled.  Dec. corn is approaching the 353 level to be filled. Oct. Live hogs a weak and trying to test lows.

65 2018-08-28 19:35:37 No hay políticas diferenciales.  Los instrumentos están disponibles para todos.  Son los productores los que tienen que manejarse con los precios internacionales y los costos internos, ese es su trabajo.  Con commodities volando hasta Bascou se llenaba de plata.
66 2018-08-28 19:34:43 Theory: When you increasingly only view players as commodities and assets, its easier to go in and tear them down to save $750K.

92 2018-08-28 18:07:29 Compared to other agricultural commodities such as corn and soybeans, the amount of beef imported a lot higher. I think beef exported only outweighed imported by $1.6bil in 2017. Corn on the other hand was 37000mmt exported compared to 1000mmt imported just for an example.

Local prices on new crop Soy is under $7.50/bu.

To break even at these prices, you will need to average a near record breaking crop, which will further drop prices.

106 2018-08-28 17:05:41 I'm not quite sure people are understanding completely. Known vs unknown commodities is a no brainer. It's adding that fact to the fact that you're also going to be paying him 20-22M a year. For most teams, this would be a huge decision.
107 2018-08-28 17:04:55 The biggest commodities in the near future are going to be information and water. The decisions we make now about how to handle those will determine what kind of a society we live in.

109 2018-08-28 17:01:44 The logic isn't ONLY about known vs known commodities though. If this was trading for Mack two years ago, absolute no brainer. It's not, though. It's trading for him now where not only do you have to give up a ton, but you also have to cough up 20-22M per year for him.

116 2018-08-28 16:27:47 It's up 357% in the commodities market right now....
117 2018-08-28 16:22:30 No that just means your definition is idiotic. Capitalism is private ownership of productive capital with laborers who work for a wage to produce commodities sold on the market
118 2018-08-28 16:21:59 Eventually you see that when you produce exceptional work, you never have to oversell the benefits. 

This applies to commodities as well as yourself. When you're dope, you never have to oversell yourself. People just know. 

That which is not natural must always be exaggerated.
119 2018-08-28 16:21:59 He has a point , if Oil as a commodity has a use case , being traded on the commodities market , wont it be simple for Oil companies to purchase Crude from Venezuela by using the token , which will be a lubricant in cutting down  cost and reducing friction @BankXRP @C3_Nik
120 2018-08-28 16:00:02 "Capital is money, capital is commodities. … By virtue of it being value, it has acquired the occult ability to add value to itself. It brings forth living offspring, or, at the least, lays golden eggs." - Karl Marx

126 2018-08-28 15:30:47 1) Our analysis focused on impacts given the world as its structured

157 2018-08-28 14:00:53 US core inflation is entirely driven by its core services sectors, of which rent and OER are the - by far - key drivers. Core commodities have deflated for years and are still flat. So, any accurately grounded higher inflation expectations must reflect either (a) material...

184 2018-08-28 12:03:07 No. It's not 'one way of looking at it'. I'm not interested in 'exchange rates' or looking at people as if they are exchangable commodities as opposed to human beings. I don't even know why you're going down this route. You're on really thin ice now.

187 2018-08-28 11:39:15 Exporting commodities = Exporting jobs - NOI
188 2018-08-28 11:27:25 It depends on the types of goods.  Simple commodities such as raw foodstuffs tend to have minimal regulation and are very price sensitive, so tariffs can make or break a business. For high value added, highly regulated goods - say patented medicines or medical devices -
189 2018-08-28 11:26:10 Holidays would be spoilt by purchasing these products. Travel firms should put out a warning of the danger of drinking/eating these commodities.
190 2018-08-28 11:19:08 Risk management first, saving money second. But as technology progresses you get both. Mining companies love to tell you they purchase commodities like diesel and electricity at “spot” until oil hits $130/barrel and electricity $130/MWh. Then suddenly it’s a national crisis.

198 2018-08-28 10:33:34 The fundamentals of economics drives the price of commodities. As supply dips, demand increases and prices rise.
199 2018-08-28 10:28:50 The tentative trade deal between the #US & #Mexico has boosted oil prices in the last day. Ongoing talks with #Canada will probably be tense, however, meaning that price volatility will remain a risk over the next week.

208 2018-08-28 09:35:51 This is exactly the cause of the problem. The reduction in state houses, the reliance on private landlords means tenants are seen as disposable commodities rather than people deserving of a decent home.
