Why?
Trump & GOP Congress coasted for over a year on the solidly well designed  #Obama recovery & economy & gave wealthy a tax break instead of creating policies for this stage of our economy.

4 2018-12-17 23:57:51 It’s ok thanks anyway. I don’t have internet where I live just my phone and this thing doesn’t work that well. I have to drive into town to trade stocks. I was home when I saw it so I just asked to see if someone had information I wasn’t trying to get fed lol. Thanks any ways

6 2018-12-17 23:57:46 Government officials should not be allowed to own stocks or personal businesses.

Thank you for coming to my Ted talk

Market makers during OPEX week may also need stocks higher
8 2018-12-17 23:57:21 For Christmas, I'm thinking about only gifting things that will grow in value: stocks, bonds, etc.

10 2018-12-17 23:54:27 Careful Wall Street..sending a mixed message on an economy that’s on the rebound, could hurt stocks. Either its thriving, or it isn’t.

13 2018-12-17 23:53:21 Look what you've done..

Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 are on pace for their worst December performance since 1931, when stocks were battered during the Great Depression. The Dow and S&P 500 are down 7.8 percent and 7.6 percent this month, respectively.
14 2018-12-17 23:52:33 No. The issue here was whether I could explain to you why your comparison is as off as equating stocks and flow. A: No.  So let's move on the important issues, international comparison and reducing NYC costs.
15 2018-12-17 23:52:32 They do that with stocks. The reason why twitter has a character limit is so people’s ideas are condense to a few words and it’s easy for data to be processed and sold to companies

17 2018-12-17 23:51:20 Bob, read the whole thing. This is no time to panic. Hold what you have and shift to value stocks and /or some bonds. Tariffs have something to do with it,  but not everything.
18 2018-12-17 23:49:29 Stocks are one policy mistake away from a debacle. The Fed better not deliver a hawkish hike this Wednesday.

39 2018-12-17 23:49:16 If you're interested in the majority of Americans...the majority of us don't own any stocks. Just sayin'...
40 2018-12-17 23:48:15 Stocks down and talk of a recession....explain to me how our economy is stronger...
41 2018-12-17 23:47:45 Hi Jessica, thanks for reaching out about our new Plant-Based Loaf! We're glad you're as excited as we are! This will be ranged in over 800 of our stores as of the 17th of December and is available while stocks last. Thanks.
42 2018-12-17 23:46:35 Another fun fact, worst December for stocks since 1931
43 2018-12-17 23:46:15 You did this mistake.  Our stocks are trash and the money you claimed responsibility for is gone.  How is your bank account.  There goes my vote.  Just like my 401k.
44 2018-12-17 23:46:07 Many many new ponytails in stocks!!
45 2018-12-17 23:45:54 Today, stocks dropped over 500 points. This is the worst December for US stocks since 1931, during the Great Depression. No, our economy is NOT stronger than ever.
46 2018-12-17 23:45:46 i feel you....i maining inkling and lucina atm...i played against my friend 5 stocks...i didnt 5-0 him with inkling or lucina...but with peach...guess i am a peach main now ._.
47 2018-12-17 23:45:44 Winning dumb tweet of the year is a guy plying his trade in the UK with 11 potential employers all looking at him now and erasing his elite prospects page from their internet history well done your stocks just took a dive worse than subprime mortgages 
48 2018-12-17 23:45:04 I stopped reading at "The stock market is now within a stone's throw of all-time highs and unemployment is less than 5 percent" considering it was from 2017 and stocks are at their lowest since 2008.
49 2018-12-17 23:44:22 give them to your bffl  & invest in stocks so u can buy another closet 
50 2018-12-17 23:44:16 actually its not. America only offers the right to earn a living of one's choice. Nothing more. 

But many on the left are freaking out about her statement on making money of stocks
51 2018-12-17 23:43:32 It ain't really a gameplan for penny stocks honestly lol. You just gotta find one with a lot of buzz on the stock message boards
52 2018-12-17 23:43:04 Stocks go up and then they go down. They go up again and then down again. Over and over and over. Thats how the markets work. #ItsReallyThatSimple
53 2018-12-17 23:42:55 Insiders continued to buy at some of the E&Ps through last Friday. The buyers had bought a few weeks earlier and were doubling down. Sizzle. That sends a strong signal. They're willing to dive in again. #oil #stocks
54 2018-12-17 23:42:36 Maybe you should invest in other stocks
55 2018-12-17 23:42:33 Way to Pres Trump— you boasted earlier this year that we should thank you for the Stock Market rallying. Well, now we can thank you for killing our stocks and 401k. Maybe you should just leave us alone as we don’t need your help!
56 2018-12-17 23:42:33 Wall Street going down is all the Fed TheWorldBank Soros &Globalist R mad Trump bragged about the Stocks going up&they could not stand itThey had2actThe slimmy 1%  is absolutely hurting America&themselves InPocketbook2hurtTrump I wantU2know1%URgoing againstGod&the American people
57 2018-12-17 23:42:12 It's hardly #stocks that define a depression - especially since at least now, most all Americans won't be making a living from them for decades, if ever.
It's a dire lack of good-wage jobs.
43% of past five years college grads now underemployed ("Fortune" August).
58 2018-12-17 23:42:05 Tomorrow Fed will raise rates. Stocks have lost all 2018 gains. Trade wars have no end in sight. You’ve created this trade war with horrible diplomacy and it’s hurting Americans, not you and your billionaire friends. 
Deal with our deficit!!!
59 2018-12-17 23:41:43 tumblr doesn't have stocks as it's not a company, and yahoo doesn't own them anymore either.
60 2018-12-17 23:40:22 I gotta stop having a conscience and invest in some pharmaceutical stocks. Y’all gon pop legal beans all day regardless why not get rich off your poor decision making skills
61 2018-12-17 23:40:14 Exactly.Why does @smartertrader lie ? He says he’s not tweeting about policy , politics or anything besides stocks @smartertrader entire twtr is abt other stuff. You know why? @smartertrader diverts it from his horrible option trades he gave. That’s why. Mr. Conman @smartertrader
62 2018-12-17 23:39:22 Stocks are shit right now. Thanks.
63 2018-12-17 23:39:07 And the Stocks FALLING!!!! @realDonaldTrump has to go!!! December has not been this low since Depression !!
64 2018-12-17 23:39:00 Only two stocks on the #ASX200 increased more than 100% in value over the last 12 months – $BVS Bravura and $APT Afterpay.
65 2018-12-17 23:38:37 Stocks will recover as soon as we stop the FED from raising rates!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
66 2018-12-17 23:38:17 The stock market is eventually going to collapse if stocks keep sliding. Oh wait, no worries everything is alright.
67 2018-12-17 23:37:45 Know which cro-MAGAs we haven't heard from recently? The "tRump's such a smart businessman" set has gone quiet.

71 2018-12-17 23:36:05 So the $1 trillion from tax cuts went to help our needy. Gotchu. I also heard that corporations are hiring more people/expanding instead of buying back stocks.
72 2018-12-17 23:35:41 @CNBC has moved further and further from covering the markets and closer to cheering for them. I always thought they let you on to give their coverage some balance, I guess they want imbalance these days.  #gold #stocks
73 2018-12-17 23:35:38 if powell hikes stocks fall
more. 
i hope Trump will fire him.

Times are too serious for
just mediocre action.
Give us a new powell .
Trump is right on this. i watched him on "Tuesday

he is smart financial analyst.

75 2018-12-17 23:34:33 I’ve seen a lot of people talking about buying more from ASOS etc! That’s not going to save these companies, that’s not how stocks work I’m afraid! Yes sales were down, that triggers uncertainty from shareholders & they sell there shares to use the money gained or lost to

77 2018-12-17 23:34:05 wasn't it the case that around 10% of people hold 85% of the stocks, I may have picked on some propaganda, but if this is correct, stk mkt swings either way would leave people.. just about the same
78 2018-12-17 23:33:57 Of course. And that same person probably has to do stocks AND sales. They be dogging their employees lol
79 2018-12-17 23:33:51 How many "bump stocks" do you believe are owned by Denverites? I'm not representative of the biggest "gun nuts" (a term I use lovingly because I may be in that club to some degree.) I've never seen a bump stock nor known anyone who owns one. They're stupid devices.
80 2018-12-17 23:33:35 o no my stocks
81 2018-12-17 23:33:20 Also, stock buybacks are not bad for a business. So I’m not sure how this explains anything you are trying to push. No one is forced to give back their stocks unless they believed they were getting a good deal. People can get their money back and reinvest when they have stock BBs

84 2018-12-17 23:32:04 They're all corrupt.  Comey, congress, senate, all of them.  Corrupt.  I'm thinking this is more of a shakedown than anything.
That's what they've been doing, why Zuckerberg and Sindal sold their stocks before their testimonies.
I wonder how much stock Comey's sold?

88 2018-12-17 23:31:03 @TheFive @TheJuanWilliams the reason you didn't learn about buying stocks and PE Ratios is because you didn't take economics or financial management and it shows! Those are REAL classes not stuff you should have learned to function in life. It won't be covered in adulting either.
89 2018-12-17 23:30:53 can you run a screen anytime p/c ratio over 1.3 equity p/c over 0.9 and stocks down over 10% in last 3 months ?
90 2018-12-17 23:30:37 Raise cash where possible. It's still not too late to sell. Bear markets wreak havocs on accounts and staying fully invested makes it impossible to buy fundamentally strong stocks when the dust finally settles.

94 2018-12-17 23:28:51 3 of the 4 assets with the lowest DSIs are the #Nasdaq (10), S&P (8), and Oil (7). Someone you should tell Trump that you cannot have low oil prices and high stocks at the same time... High yield debt sees to that. #SPX
95 2018-12-17 23:28:27 I totally agree with that. Look at Tom Price. When he bought stocks in a medical device company and then sponsored and voted for approval of the bill that supported that medical  company. It's total bullshit that they do stuff and very often get away with it.

106 2018-12-17 23:24:14 Among secondary indicators today, we saw the highest equity put-call ratio since October 2016 (good) but a new high in the number of stocks hitting new lows on both the NYSE and Nasdaq (bad intermediate-term, though could be a washout reading short-term).
107 2018-12-17 23:24:12 The selling in #microcap stocks continues to wear down even hardened investors - myself included. I have had more than my share of "head shaking" this past month. But, if there is a light at the end of the tunnel, it is that #taxloss selling wraps up next week. #TSX #TSXV #CSE
108 2018-12-17 23:23:54 Stocks down another 500 today. Pigeons coming home to roost. The idiot in the WH owns it.
109 2018-12-17 23:23:50 Seem like maybe certain stocks is better than sector specific?
110 2018-12-17 23:22:28 Could not have said it better. His money in stocks would take hit along with all stock holders if CBS did not deny. I would be more interested in knowing what CBS likely knew before hand and when they knew it..

112 2018-12-17 23:22:16 Market stumbled soundly, following $AMZN, $PLD and $TWTR. 119 major stocks tanked significantly. 142 fluctuated, with 137 went down. 226 traded below 90-day low. Dragged by Real Estate and Utilities sectors
113 2018-12-17 23:22:11 I'd rather have stock buy backs vs dividends.  Use excess cash and buy back the stocks (after you invest in better products, marketing, etc).  Gives the shareholder more stock over time and much more value.

124 2018-12-17 23:17:50 Look, with an inverted economy popping its head that usually brings a recession. Even chief financial officers are expecting one to strike next year.

We Are Now In Line With: 1931 Great Depression! All On Trump, His: RAISING TARRIFFS & RAISING INTEREST RATES, JOBS?!
128 2018-12-17 23:16:22 Pretty good timing considering a lot of people just watched u use roller to close out a lot of stocks
129 2018-12-17 23:15:28 Alors ce sont des petits stocks, là il me reste 15 Yetta je crois ! Honnêtement je ne peux pas te dire combien il m’en restera :/. Je t’envoie un dm attends !
130 2018-12-17 23:15:22 Cute, they said before election, that economy and stocks would nose dive. Keep listening though.
131 2018-12-17 23:13:48 @RunningMan99 also good stocks with sound fundies don’t go to zero. They go on fire sale.
132 2018-12-17 23:13:44 Or they can become either a developer or  UX\UI designer in 12-16 weeks and then get a job paying no less than $70k.  

Tech is the new real estate & stocks wealth builder.
133 2018-12-17 23:13:41 stocks rise by 1%.
134 2018-12-17 23:13:22 Are you proposing a policy? I see 3 options:
1) Allow gifts like gift cards and board
2) Prohibit congresspeople from owning individual stocks (index funds are OK)
3) Pay congresspeople more

1 seems bad, 2 is good, 3 is probably good too but would come across as self-serving.
135 2018-12-17 23:13:18 Blind Trusts or at the very least broadly based vanilla mutual funds. No Congressperson should be allowed to trade stocks in companies whose fate can be affected by the legislation they vote on.
136 2018-12-17 23:13:12 Don't be too concerned about how stocks took a big dip today. This is not 1929; this is a twist and turn market.  Just be ready to dance to the beat of a higher-divine-order. 
137 2018-12-17 23:13:06 Why does @jimcramer hate making money??  Weed stocks headed higher so ez
138 2018-12-17 23:12:48 What is your “trick” in regards to 696 days?  Why not earlier when Trump crushed the increase before he was even in office?  Stocks reflect confidence not sales.  Lets go GDP beotch?  Dont make us look up your weird fact.  What about all those empty strip malls from Obama era?
139 2018-12-17 23:12:41 D'ici janvier à ton avis il t'en restera ou ce sont des petits stocks ? 
140 2018-12-17 23:12:36 All 30 #DowJones stocks were down for the day, with a overall drop of 507 points. #Dresner interviews @YossiGestetner on KM 114.

142 2018-12-17 23:12:19 It's just not useful for SSBU's gamespeed, games go by so fast and disadvantage is so hard to get out of that only playing with 2 stocks can make games super one sided once you are in a disadvantage
143 2018-12-17 23:12:04 What would you suggest to do with the stocks he was given?
144 2018-12-17 23:11:47 "All the best stocks"
145 2018-12-17 23:11:35 Ce sont des limitées ! Enfin jusqu’à épuisement des stocks ^^.
146 2018-12-17 23:11:32 No Sam. I have very little at play ATM. I am long Russian stocks for past 2 yrs. long options - China, Telstra, & EU Financials (getting killed). And short S&P  now performing very well.

In OZ only hold 4 stocks.

Holding 70% cash across my total portfolio
147 2018-12-17 23:11:27 If you took tRump’s advice to buy stocks during his 2018 SOTU address, you are now down 11%

151 2018-12-17 23:09:56 Today's Market = Dying Love Fern

Markets faded red today as growth fears caught hold around the globe. Tech stocks sold off as economic growth indicators withered a bit last week. Potted plants need love.

S&P 500: 2,545.94

12/17/18
152 2018-12-17 23:09:44 Stocks have been in bear market territory for weeks though the $IWM $RTY  declined over 20% from the October high today.
153 2018-12-17 23:09:17 With so many cases we do not know how juries think and what might be  awarded . Just my opinion thousands of other stocks to invest in.
154 2018-12-17 23:08:46 Also congratulations and Merry Xmas to all those holding stocks that were bought back by Corporate Tax Breaks given this year by your Government! As for me, I can barely afford to wipe my own ass much less buy stocks on the market or invest in any capital goods! Thanks Santa!
155 2018-12-17 23:08:12 Stocks tanking today got me thinking...

Every “personal brand” built on social media has been built in good — if not, great — economic conditions.

Interesting to see what comes of this space when the next downtown in economic conditions hits.
156 2018-12-17 23:07:19 It can’t just be the specific congressmembers for this to work. Has to be their entire household, and there has to be a law against willing stocks to a congressmember too. Also, you have to outlaw having a friend “hold it for them” while they’re a member to give back after.
157 2018-12-17 23:06:18 Les ruptures répétitives des stocks est un vrai problème de vaccination dans ce pays.
158 2018-12-17 23:05:59 How did stocks do today?!
159 2018-12-17 23:05:56 Now let's hope things change for the better.  More advertising,  more products,  more sales.  Stocks will go up.  Let's go!
160 2018-12-17 23:05:51 HyperX Stocks
161 2018-12-17 23:05:08 I own stocks so I can relate to the searing pain.
162 2018-12-17 23:04:35 Stocks are not cheap at the moment... Stocks were cheap a lots of years ago.
163 2018-12-17 23:04:17 Reform: no member of Congress should be allowed own individual stocks or bonds.  They should be strictly limited by law to broad-market stock funds/etfs and broad-market bond funds/etfs.
164 2018-12-17 23:03:46 Obamacare was the biggest insurance fraud scam perpetrated on Americans ever! Do you notice all the insurance company stocks are going down. When ACA passed, insurance stocks skyrocketed from 30% to 300%. Huge scam. The insurance companies made all the money, now they are not!
165 2018-12-17 23:03:42 Of course they are going to place crazy targets on the stocks ($CURA & $ACRG) they increased the size of the deals without lowering the price.  The stocks are down almost 40% from their IPO prices.

170 2018-12-17 23:00:00 Sell stocks, buy guns and ammo.
171 2018-12-17 22:59:52 Is there any possibility that the stocks trump owns are doing well? Could this be driven by the me myself & I train for his profit?
172 2018-12-17 22:59:33 @jaketapper Trump likes to point to the stock market as a sign of his success as president. Stocks are on track to deliver their worst December since the Great Depression in 1931. MAGA?
173 2018-12-17 22:59:31 Hey Melissa, you're complicit in giving time to Brian Kelly. When the hell will CNBC stop harming it's viewers? It's not just crypto, it's stocks too. Watch the exodus to @FoxBusiness
174 2018-12-17 22:59:26 I am still up big on my crypto holdings.  Stocks worse than crypto for me!
175 2018-12-17 22:59:21 Here's my hunch of Fed meeting outcome. Script: Should he raise rates (bad for stocks in MT/LT), the market will rally immediately on too much pessimism priced in. Should he balk (in theory good for stocks), the mkt will drop as a shoe on perceived fear of recession (augmented)
176 2018-12-17 22:59:08 How else can formerly incarcerated brown & black people take advantage of the Cannabis wave...stocks, etc?
177 2018-12-17 22:58:05 Terrible cucked out game....horrendous. When is EA actually gonna make a good game again ? Sales are terrible, stocks crashing and you morons still won’t listen to the people who actually buy the games. Idiotic commercial with Noah Trevor, my GOD....
178 2018-12-17 22:58:04 Agree and almost all stocks are a bargain for 401k's now.
179 2018-12-17 22:58:03 I disagree, our first correction was in January then October... a bear market is defined by a price fall and widespread pessimism causing the stock market's downward spiral to be self-sustaining. Hence most stocks on the ASX
180 2018-12-17 22:56:31 Time to cash out btc and buy weed stocks then
181 2018-12-17 22:56:23 The #DeepState Fed is driving down the Stock Market, but will have plenty of time to recover before 2020. 
What to do now?
Buy Cheap Stocks.
182 2018-12-17 22:55:24 No good reason to buy stocks... Risk is not worth it
183 2018-12-17 22:55:20 Weed stocks he’s making his own company for weed.
184 2018-12-17 22:55:05 'they' did not 'jack up' stock prices.......it is possible the tax cut was responsible for some of the recent increases, but that's unclear.   stocks are basically worth what someone is willing to pay for them
185 2018-12-17 22:54:47 Have you tried buying stocks that go up?
186 2018-12-17 22:54:28 It’s  my opinion that we are still in the speculative era for stocks that we entered in the late 90’s. I expect it to end in a whimper not a bang. Recent action is consistent with the beginning of the end IMO. Still haven’t broken the back of the bull yet.
187 2018-12-17 22:54:14 My stocks are in the tank, but I know there’s a price to pay for uprighting the ship too...
188 2018-12-17 22:53:59 I didn't realize how deep my pockets were, my stocks are crashing, 401k's dropping and you're  begging for money to build your wall and bailout farmers, you're failing me Donnie
189 2018-12-17 22:53:27 Everything is back in stocks ladies

191 2018-12-17 22:53:19 The stocks. 
192 2018-12-17 22:52:45 I own very few stocks and even I know that this statement is A COMPLETE LIE!!

Market Facilitation Payments = entitlements!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
193 2018-12-17 22:52:43 With stock buybacks, and a market in decline. Who benefited if stocks have lost value? Explain.
194 2018-12-17 22:52:43 BREAKING: STOCKS PLUNGE AGAIN.

When Trump told #MAGA voters to buy stocks, the smart money started selling.

DJIA:

Jan 30: 26,439

Dec 17: 23,593

If you took Trump's advice to buy stocks during his 2018 #SOTU address, you are now down 11%, even as inflation continues to rise.
195 2018-12-17 22:52:41 Trump when the stocks were up u wanted to take all the credit... well take the fall since there down but u won’t admit to that will u scum bag
196 2018-12-17 22:52:29 That's a pretty nice gift! Also, it reminds me that I still need to find a place that stocks Kirin. I haven't seen it around here in a couple years.
197 2018-12-17 22:52:17 This from a Trump supporter “ you have to look at the whole picture”I said what picture he’s destroying America. He said just look at the economy. I said the deficit is out of control, stocks are falling and the economy is going to tank. His response , you just hate Trump. Yup!
198 2018-12-17 22:52:03 I think broad indexes and not individual stocks would be a good rule.
199 2018-12-17 22:52:00 Kinda like pretending you’re a bunch of wheat stocks waving in the wind???
200 2018-12-17 22:51:03 So I played 3 Matches today, each of them came down to the last stock.

I lost all 3 but it’s still progress! I’m taking more stocks.

I would love it if anyone has any Fox guides or tips??
201 2018-12-17 22:50:50 Not letting them buy or sell individual stocks. I don’t, for basically the same reasons of conflict of interest.
202 2018-12-17 22:50:49 This: U.S. stocks closed sharply lower Monday, deepening *annual* losses, amid continued worries about the impact a trade war with China may have on the U.S. economy. [1/3]
203 2018-12-17 22:50:40 Actually, all three are good short-sale candidates. I've already made some decent money shorting $MU I'd like to hear Tracey's seminar on how $KBH is a defensive stock. Or maybe how $goos and $wsm are value stocks.
204 2018-12-17 22:50:19 Thought Mark Urban soft style of interview there, rather effective.  Matt Hancock even more unconvincing on medical stocks, than usual. #Newsnight
205 2018-12-17 22:48:50 "Deal or no deal" would be an excellent euphemism for 'Price Discovery'.

206 2018-12-17 22:48:39 Thinking back to late 2000 and into 2001, stocks were rolling over and breaking down almost ubiquitously.  As I recall initial downturns were smoother than now. Not sure why. Now is not a copy of then. $spy Feel free to disagree. I don't have any pictures; maybe you do.
207 2018-12-17 22:48:36 @GrooveCubeMusic and @BolideOfficial sometimes   on huggies stocks .   
208 2018-12-17 22:48:30 What is better? No #recession while home prices stay unaffordable? Or A recession and #stocks and #401k goes to nothing and you can afford a #house ? Not ignoring the fact of how people would get hurt from a recession..... #WallSt #Economy
209 2018-12-17 22:48:18 Yesterday - Industry: #FOOD, BEVERAGE & TOBACCO was 12% Positive, with #DIVERSIFIED FINANCIALS 5% Positive. Stocks: $AUZ was 20% Positive, with $SPX 4% Positive. #ASX
210 2018-12-17 22:48:17 Hope he has a fully funded 401k and it's all in stocks.
211 2018-12-17 22:48:04 If you were to look at their stocks they have traded over the last 6 months, they're up 82% on their share value from June. So it’s going to have to slide a huge amount for it to affect them. Fingers crossed though
212 2018-12-17 22:46:57 it's legit, your stocks on the other hand....
213 2018-12-17 22:46:29 So let me get this straight, @POTUS gifts a tax cut to corporations. They buy back $1 trillion in stocks instead of paying employees more. And the stock market is down for the year. At this rate, if I get any more tired of "winning," I'll never be able to afford to retire.
214 2018-12-17 22:46:25 When wasast time Trump took credit for the stock market?

"If the stock market is going to have a Santa Claus rally this year, it must peel Santa off the pavement first.Stocks had a bad one today, and this month is on pace to be the second-worst December ever for the S&P 500."
215 2018-12-17 22:46:23 The #crudeoil market failed to stabilize after a weekly loss, with prices suffering additional pressure from data that reportedly revealed a jump in crude stocks of 630,000 barrels last week @ the Cushing, OK, U.S. trading hub #MarketWatch
216 2018-12-17 22:46:16 On average how many stocks are you watching during the day? 10 to 20?
217 2018-12-17 22:45:53 my uncle sold a music-related product to Dunlop. he invested the money into blue-chip stocks for the long term, like my grandfather taught him.

219 2018-12-17 22:43:43 You guys are the most anti-crypto and technology people around... why didn’t you take @APompliano million dollar bet stocks/bitcoin?!?!
220 2018-12-17 22:43:26 Let’s just think about this for a minute. The Sec of State for Health is telling the nation live on TV right now he has become the world’s biggest buyer of fridges as the NHS stocks up for the no deal disaster. If that happens will our Parliament be forgiven? #Newsnight
221 2018-12-17 22:42:26 @MysteryTrader99 Gundlach talked a lot of sense today. Your charts for the stock market are saying the same thing. A bear market and another big leg down. 80% of stocks have recently had a bearish death cross.

224 2018-12-17 22:41:46 So are they a good choice or not? Lots of people in the pf twitter space will say no, 100% stocks or gtfo, but personally I'm a fan of balance and understanding that I'm not smart enough to know everything and put all my eggs into one asset class
225 2018-12-17 22:41:42 #Tumblr #TumblrLogOff #tumblrpurge Guys, stop checking your tumblrs. Don't even go to the website. Radio silence is was we need and site traffic is still site traffic, logged in or not. The stocks are going up again.
226 2018-12-17 22:41:22 Reads “Market facilitation payments” asks, do you socialism much? Asks then, why does a free market need propped up w handouts?  You are such a fraud of epic nightmare proportions it’s historic like stocks tanking again. Worst Dec since G.Depression!
227 2018-12-17 22:41:12 @rinsana only trades a virtual portfolio of stocks. So if he loses it's not real money, thus he won't care and it won't affect his livelihood
228 2018-12-17 22:41:09 No offense...but capitulation from long standing bulls is classic bottoming action.  And saying you can always get back in higher is as well.  With that being said, I fully understand why you did it...stocks could easily go down further...would u buy back in 30% lower is ?
229 2018-12-17 22:41:00 Had to pull some of my stocks so I can pay bills

234 2018-12-17 22:37:56 overlooking several things-
Obama deliberately supressed the rates to drive money OUT of bonds and INTO stocks-
had that not been going on- he would have had a full blown depression-
now- the market is facing a Democrat Cabal and assuming they must prepare for more Democrat theft
235 2018-12-17 22:37:15 How many of you know you have the best stocks in your portfolio yet watch all the shit companies multibag on nothing but hype by shyster CEO's whilst yours fo nowhere fast on progressive newsflow from top management? 
236 2018-12-17 22:36:53 Stay long, and add onto SPXS as it broke out above $30. Budget shutdown should add to the fire. Thanks to Trump-no Santa-Clause rally this year. Also stay short Feb. Cattle as they are in the profit. #Agriculture #Cattle #Stocks #SPXS #Commodities
237 2018-12-17 22:36:49 Tech stocks were driven down on FUD during the dot com only to boom, and now the forerunner of that bull run Amazon could trigger a similar bull run with a Ripple announcement. How cheeky would that be
238 2018-12-17 22:36:47 Now it comes down to monitoring the macro data to determine when it’s safe to sell the CD’s and get back into stocks
239 2018-12-17 22:36:43 Just be careful: if you ever quit/go back,  don't buy any stocks beforehand. You don't want to be accused of insider trading.
240 2018-12-17 22:36:05 @Nasdaq why do we leave the markets in the hands of those 3-4 animals who speculate on stocks by destroying them? 2008 didn’t teach anything to anyone?

247 2018-12-17 22:34:53  yes those communists proposed Tariffs, broke EVERY trade deal we ever had, and then they blew up the health care stocks by saying ACA is unconstitutional.

249 2018-12-17 22:34:06 I'm just saying her straightforward point: that members of congress than author legislation that helps specific stocks/companies they own is both a) an inducement for corruption and b) perfectly legal. STOCK is good and adds a layer of transparency, but that's not her point

@LukeKalsi1 @Ben21James
256 2018-12-17 22:32:58 Lol ok. stocks are a indicator of future earnings and performance.  stocks are negative in 2018, which his second year and a true reflection of his presidency and disastrous policies.
257 2018-12-17 22:32:48 I propose that Trump Supporters should Crowdfund the Border Wall.

I have bricks for sale @ $250 per brick for canny GOP Investors.  Hurry while stocks last!

258 2018-12-17 22:32:39 Stocks are on sale right now. Liking veeva systems, salesforce and Microsoft.
259 2018-12-17 22:32:36 Wouldn’t oil in the 20s be wildly deflationary?  Stocks would probably be off quite a bit.  What would be the impetus to raise rates in that scenario?
260 2018-12-17 22:32:25 You can already guess what the headlines will say: ‘Stocks down, all hedgefunds turning to bitcoin’ I won’t be surprised at all if we do hit the 10k mark
261 2018-12-17 22:31:44 Ma mère faisait des stocks de 5 boîtes l'an dernier à chaque fois quand je rentrais XD
262 2018-12-17 22:31:14 $SPY scary hours #stocks
263 2018-12-17 22:30:32 He loses the bet no matter what. Running backs stocks are taking a dive.  He just lost 14mil.
264 2018-12-17 22:30:25 Man. During the #tumblrpurge - it's rather interesting watching the Verizon Stocks throughout the day. Gonna get me some popcorn for this.
265 2018-12-17 22:30:15 #GiveBlood #NHSlongtermplan #bloodappeal blood stocks run low over Christmas! Please retweet, it takes 2 seconds and it could prompt one person to donate! Do your bit and share!!! #donate #Donations #DonateLife #DonateBlood #hereditaryspherocytosis
266 2018-12-17 22:29:52 The billions we've lost from our economy, our slide down the world & G7 rankings, the masses of companies leaving the UK, the £120bn lost overnight from UK stocks, the £3bn plus that had to be injected all because of the referendum. You stick your head in the sand if you want.
267 2018-12-17 22:29:10 Can't be more happy today that I started learning options! @optionsanimal will teach you how to make money when stocks go down and when they go up. Loving the Bear Call and Bull Put the last few weeks. As volatility rises, so can your account balance!
268 2018-12-17 22:29:06 Not to minimize things here but I think most tech stocks look like this right now - I just checked the company I work for and it's similar.
269 2018-12-17 22:28:44 Tip - This correction looks like a 15%’r all the way. If so, it will recover. If you are smart and many here are, you placed a 10% stop loss, and will put your money to use buying discounted stocks. Will you sit out another two years of a Bull Market? Not me, it can have returns.
270 2018-12-17 22:28:40 I understand, but please persist. Their stocks are rising again because people are checking in. You can do it.
271 2018-12-17 22:28:26 It’s all about valuations, SP500 closed today around 20PE it’s historic median is around 14PE in past bear markets it has sold off to 10PE or stocks could loose 50% of their value from this level. In 2009 at the bottom SP500 was 5 PE so that’s a drop of 75% from here . Be careful
272 2018-12-17 22:28:20 @realDonaldTrump #GOP Stocks close at the lowest level since October 2017. Thanks @realDonaldTrump
273 2018-12-17 22:28:08 Market Close: MBS +17bps; DOW -507.53; NASDAQ -156.93; S&P 500 -54.01; 10yr Treasury 2.86%; Stocks take a nosedive ahead of FOMC and upcoming (expected) Rate Hike.
274 2018-12-17 22:28:03 But if Companies are buying stocks with the money they got from the tax cuts that would make the market go higher not lower
275 2018-12-17 22:27:23 Red flag meaning a rally for stocks since bonds did nothing?
276 2018-12-17 22:26:50 Definitely a time to sit on cash and watch which #Uranium stocks to top up when the market turns....two things for sure 1) It will turn 2) U stocks will out perform in 2019.
277 2018-12-17 22:26:28 Stocks are going to continue to drift down while Fed continues to unwind QE. Unwind QE is key to battle progressive/tech overlords who are using RE/tech bubble money to dominate rest of us. Take away their funny money, and they become mortal.
278 2018-12-17 22:25:40 US stocks YTD (total returns):

Large -3.1%
Mid -7.6%
Small -7.7%

279 2018-12-17 22:24:54 I really wouldn't know about this "stronger than ever" economy when I look at the way my stocks have tanked.
280 2018-12-17 22:24:29 The financial markets have been a bloodbath today. Stocks are taking a big plunge.
281 2018-12-17 22:23:34 What does this all mean i would like to be informed... stocks seem interesting
282 2018-12-17 22:23:27 South Shields service was an absolute disgrace. Lying to your face about stocks. When I come to get an upgrade next year I’ll be staying well clear!
283 2018-12-17 22:23:16 Bruh

I literally made 112k the previous yr

When it hit, i fucking made 17k the whole year. 

Had nothing in stocks
401k went to shit
Used my savings to stay afloat
Wife got laid off
I got furloughed
Gas was $4 a gallon
Groceries high
Even the price of diapers spiked
284 2018-12-17 22:22:47 Stocks for you ...very unpuritan of you
285 2018-12-17 22:22:35 Do you trade stock options? If so, how has that been going? #finance #optionstrading #stocks #wallstreet
286 2018-12-17 22:22:16 In a bear market stocks can remain oversold and still continue lower for an extended period. Careful
287 2018-12-17 22:21:44 Stay there, while stocks of gluhwein last, at least until 30th of March.... 
288 2018-12-17 22:21:16 True penny stocks are terrifying,  done it once or twice when the obvious pattern is there, but I hate it. Nothing wrong with having standards.
289 2018-12-17 22:20:45 How can you equate people investing in stocks and people accepting gifts. Like I get what you’re going for but yikes that is such a reach.

291 2018-12-17 22:20:26 Stocks are on pace for their worst December since the Great Depression in 1931, but I'm sure that's all Obama's fault, right Trump and supporters?
292 2018-12-17 22:20:07 The last time the S&P and Dow fell this much in December was 1980 - when Jimmy Carter was president (and had just lost his re-election bid to Ronald Reagan). If stocks fall a bit further, then Herbert Hoover and 1931 will have to be mentioned  (@MarketWatch)
293 2018-12-17 22:19:29 I am sweating the underperformance of international stocks.
294 2018-12-17 22:19:28 Slightly more than half of Americans have some stake in the stock market, but for those that do, it's typically a negligible amount. The top 10% of people own 84% of all stocks.
295 2018-12-17 22:19:11 Write down the following instructions carefully. Sell all your tech stocks in 1999.
296 2018-12-17 22:19:04 More completions in Nov while stocks prices and oil prices had cratered demonstrates the E&P mind set.

I would not expect a quick production drop. Even if they cut back huge, drop will be seen in Jan. As of now EIA is expecting growth based on completions.
297 2018-12-17 22:18:49 This is a business news emergency broadcast. The Politics Advocates are pushing legislation that could impact the future shares of  AAPL stocks. Thank you for tuning into  CNN.
298 2018-12-17 22:18:42 Stocks are up and down, wages down,  1000 s of lost jobs due to closing stores.  CA is literally burning to the ground.  Climate change disaster
299 2018-12-17 22:18:32 Not many stocks give you high risk and a get out of jail card in the same program. Personally not seen this situation before ever. #BOIL anyone remember #CEB valued at 10m with hot hair and lies. #Boil is a wet dream to Whitby
300 2018-12-17 22:18:27 Learn to invest in stocks or real estate and let your money make money. It’s the best thing ever.
301 2018-12-17 22:18:20 @lloydblankfein Lloyd. I'm Making A Brand New Type Of Stocks Shares. I Named Them. Common Abilities Shares. They Are Exactly Like.
302 2018-12-17 22:18:08 US stocks drop to a 14-month low as tech, health care drop
303 2018-12-17 22:17:47 Peter Navarro was laughable in @CNBC when he said the Fed was the biggest risk to US economic growth. No, stocks got slammed today and the biggest risk is having tRump attempting to dictate economic policy which he knows nothing about.
304 2018-12-17 22:17:46 December 2018. My Stocks  My Weight . Ugh
305 2018-12-17 22:16:58 Not currently! We offer stocks and funds traded on major US exchanges, but not penny stocks.
306 2018-12-17 22:16:40 not into stocks but the bitcoin bubble finally popped
307 2018-12-17 22:15:06 Please continue screwing up the economy. Want to rebuy stocks at prices >50% lower than now
308 2018-12-17 22:14:14 good thing none of you have enough money to own stocks 

or you wouldn't have enough left to bet
309 2018-12-17 22:13:50 Stocks closing with big losses ... Dow -537 points.
310 2018-12-17 22:13:46 Bond king Jeff Gundlach says, "I'm pretty sure this is a bear market." Stocks fell further after the headlines hit a few hours ago.
311 2018-12-17 22:13:42 The Russell 2000 just crossed into bear market territory (down 20% off its highs). Some interesting stats: Only 635 stocks (31%) are showing positive gains ytd... 275 (14%) of those names are down more than 50%... And 28% of the index is trading below 12x forward earnings.
312 2018-12-17 22:13:18 My minimal stocks have plummeted. I’m now the atom of Wall Street. I was a fruit fly.
313 2018-12-17 22:13:13 Listen up online Smash players. If you don't have 3 stocks and at least 6 minutes as your preferred rules, not only am I going to play lame, if I win I'm not giving you the rematch. ESPECIALLY if you have shitty internet as well. Y'all getting the classic one and done. ;)
314 2018-12-17 22:12:49 I met someone who did three stocks in 3 minutes so I choked super hard.

Last stock, I was fresh on a new one and the dude would’ve died with one back air but he timed me the fuck out and won I was livid
315 2018-12-17 22:12:17 I need to invest in stocks
316 2018-12-17 22:12:13 That’s because stocks WERE ON THE RISE when Trump took over due to OBAMA, since then he ARTIFICIALLY INFLATED the Market with the TAX CUTS because of Corporate Buy Backs of their OWN STOCK. Remember that was the BIG MONEY that was supposed to go to Employees but didn’t!  Now ...

Stocks close at lowest level since October 2017/Yahoo Finance
318 2018-12-17 22:11:31 Holding stocks long isn't the question.The real question is: "When is the TradeWar ending?"

As soon as the Trade issue ends is the time to go long, imo

Until then,expect scalping and testing support lines until 'enough time has passed by.' 

Or apple bears rally onAppleWatch 4
319 2018-12-17 22:11:23 because internet. that's why. everyone thinks they are right and knows more. i dont know jack anything about stocks.
320 2018-12-17 22:11:05 Which stocks are you still holding?
321 2018-12-17 22:10:39 lol stocks dive again today..  I am convinced you are mentally ill and unfit for anything.
322 2018-12-17 22:10:32 Impact of the stock market decline won't be felt by working people who don't invest in stocks, but higher prices from rising interest rates, inflation, trade tariffs, lack of raises, and upcoming job losses from multiple factors will. Trump's great economy is starting to teeter.
323 2018-12-17 22:10:29 He can start by banning bump stocks.
324 2018-12-17 22:10:24 Promise made, Promise Failed: 
“S&P 500 drops more than 2% to new low for 2018, Dow dives 500 points.”

“Dow falls 508 points, Nasdaq turns negative for d year.”

“Stocks Slide on Global Growth Concerns”

“Trump Is Now Bad for the Stock Market.”

TRUMP IS A FELON, LIAR & CRIMINAL
325 2018-12-17 22:10:18 My stocks drop every day, they where doing much better with Obama, before you started messing with tariffs, and the economy. You call this winning?
326 2018-12-17 22:09:49 Sometimes some people get lucky for some amount of time. But irrational prices don’t last forever. Hodling through 85% down ... is a missed opportunity? Just like holding stocks after 9 years of recovery...except those include real assets & real profitable companies w employees
327 2018-12-17 22:09:29 To Me 
Being a TI 
was being in the public square in stocks , naked with shit on your face
328 2018-12-17 22:09:28 Impact of the stock market decline won't be felt by working people who don't invest in stocks, but higher prices from rising interest rates, inflation, trade tariffs, lack of raises, and upcoming job losses from multiple factors will. Trump's great economy is starting to teeter.
329 2018-12-17 22:09:15 Impact of the stock market decline won't be felt by working people who don't invest in stocks, but higher prices from rising interest rates, inflation, trade tariffs, lack of raises, and upcoming job losses from multiple factors will.

330 2018-12-17 22:09:10 Stronger than ever while the stocks are in the toilet and you cut the second round of welfare checks to save the people your bad understanding of economics are ruining...

Nobody is this stupid by accident, you've got to be trying at it.
331 2018-12-17 22:09:06 How much more can these stocks go down?  Most are down by more than 40% from ATH........If this is not a bottom, what is?

$NVDA
$ZUO
$PVTL
$AMD
$AMZN
$VIPS
$BABA
$JD
.....
And the list goes on and on.......If $NVDA goes down more, it should be sub $100 in no time

336 2018-12-17 22:07:44 Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 are on pace for their worst December performance since 1931, when stocks were battered during the Great Depression. The Dow and S&P 500 are down 7.8 percent and 7.6 percent this month, respectively.

338 2018-12-17 22:07:17 That's a unique case, there are many stocks, private equity, VC, reits, commodities, art pieces that lack liquidity.
339 2018-12-17 22:06:59 In other news, people buy stocks in hopes they will appreciate in value.
340 2018-12-17 22:06:23 don't follow TRIP but yes on TSLA. Had perfect 20sma bounce on that BS rally midday and then gave it all up. And our beloved Enterprise software stocks same thing
341 2018-12-17 22:06:00 I'm glad I don't own any stocks
342 2018-12-17 22:05:48 Stock goes up and down
Funny thing....
When stocks go up, liberals give obama credit.

343 2018-12-17 22:05:44 And thank you for your help in stock market plunging again. How about helping my 401K. Is it possible you are getting ready to buy up a bunch of stocks cheap as people unload? No you are to honest to do such a thing
344 2018-12-17 22:05:41 Crashing on a friend's couch isn't corrupting. Trading stocks on insider knowledge & actions were permissible until only recently. Guarding against ticky-tack corruption is bs while the barn door is to real thief wide open.

349 2018-12-17 22:04:22 so let me get this straight, if the Fed doesn't hike rates because the economy sucks, that's good for stocks?
350 2018-12-17 22:04:19 Setting foot on the Harborough bowling green without wearing the correct "whites" is punishable by a week in the stocks.

358 2018-12-17 22:01:58 Not worried about the levels just short or long.. let everyone else be concerned about correction territory.. markets traded okay at 666 lows same thing don't own paper stocks
359 2018-12-17 22:01:56 Trumpster logic:
Stocks do well = trump is the best president ever
Stocks tumble = it's a correction because the market was overinflated

367 2018-12-17 21:59:55 "Business doesn't want to invest in something that isn't going to make them a profit".  That's some keen journalism, you #dipshits.

Here's another for later: Investors don't want to buy stocks in companies that lose money.
368 2018-12-17 21:58:38 Seems like the stocks are down today. That can't be good.
369 2018-12-17 21:58:13 Great. Lewis just gave this knucklehead an idea. Or did people read it and just start selling stocks early.
370 2018-12-17 21:58:11 @realDonaldTrump @VP @GOP Stocks Close at 14-Month Low in Broad Sell-Off: 
you "bought" when crowed as it was going up, you OWN it now.. where are the tweets now that it's worst in 14 months...
371 2018-12-17 21:57:24 Why the need to defend farmers?  Climate change is real.   People CAN use everything grown somewhere in the world.  
Our economy is tanking!  Stocks down again today.   The emperor has no clothes!!
372 2018-12-17 21:57:20 He was one guy that popped because of crazy stocks% but I haven't gotten around to watching him and as you said, he needs that shooting regression to reverse itself to really generate interest.

374 2018-12-17 21:55:39 If his little peened ass did not care he would never have mentioned bump stocks. #ULD
375 2018-12-17 21:55:24 The R2K stocks were not supposed to be impacted as much by Tariff Man's efforts also.
376 2018-12-17 21:55:22 I follow the large NDX stocks. They seem to be in a trading range.
377 2018-12-17 21:55:05 Stocks are down over 2500 points the last three market days. If it keeps going it is going to rival 2008. A lot of heads rolled after that.
378 2018-12-17 21:54:41 how funky fibonacci is involved with stocks - i just like watching stocks plummet to the depths, i'm a peasant, i ain't got a horse in the race ha ha
379 2018-12-17 21:53:57 5 days ago it was "Wall Street Climbs 1 pct on trade optimism!"

Today it's " Wall Street drops 1 pct amid ...uhh, Health Stocks, yeah, it was Health Stocks, that's the ticket!"

Wall Street Reporters are so full of shit.
380 2018-12-17 21:53:43 Well at least stocks are on sale at nice discounts on Wall Street.
381 2018-12-17 21:53:09 “The stock market isn’t the economy” crowd should stop crowing “tax cuts for the wealthy don’t help” when stocks fall

And is Stephen Miller’s hair REALLY the thing to ridicule him for?

It’d be nice to know someone is right on substance before they’re allowed to dunk on people
382 2018-12-17 21:52:50 The top five stocks that closed lower today were $XRX, $WRK, $PKG, $ADS, and $TWTR.
383 2018-12-17 21:52:20 The top five stocks that closed higher today were $AOS, $SWKS, $HIG, $RE, and $HUM.
384 2018-12-17 21:51:38 Stocks way down.. Huge deficit.. Shutting down the government because you're a child. You're going down with Russian collusion buddy. Proof today that Russia got you elected. Whata joke
385 2018-12-17 21:51:38 The top five most active stocks today were $GE, $AMD, $BAC, $MSFT, and $F.
386 2018-12-17 21:51:22 It will go on like this until the owners start feeling the pinch. Profit is all they care about. Football went out the window with the departure of David Gill and Sir Alex. In Ed they have a loyal servant who cares only about stocks.
387 2018-12-17 21:51:04 Weed stocks man
388 2018-12-17 21:51:02 c incroyable jfais même pas partie des 50% les + stocks
389 2018-12-17 21:50:48 Especially people like the poster. As someone that is a trader one party makes more people money in finance than the other by a country mile. I remember buying medical stocks before Obamacare passed. I was literally printing money.
390 2018-12-17 21:50:32 It's about time...  But stocks took another shot - let's see... who will you blame for that, Tariff King?  The Fed chairman?  Mueller?  Comey?  Hillary?
391 2018-12-17 21:50:30 Keith is an aani who trades stocks -- but only at night.
392 2018-12-17 21:50:28 How can it be happening on a large scale when supposedly the big plus of buying US Mj right now is because these institutions don’t have access to these stocks? Which one is it  do they have access and shorting instead of buying already, or they don’t have access
393 2018-12-17 21:49:56 Meanwhile stock market plummeted today, your father is threatening to shut down the government friday! Is this how you all bring "merry" back to Christmas? #TrumpCrimeFamily #LockThemAllUp #stocks #StockMarket #Collusion
394 2018-12-17 21:49:51 Choice is to fight for proper funding, perhaps licence Danish trawlers who are angry at the thought of losing fishing grounds, or face the EU decimating fishing stocks with the dutch electric fishing method
395 2018-12-17 21:49:37 We missed the "great" together ..... my stocks ship is sinking.
396 2018-12-17 21:47:20 100% bro. Desperation act to keep the stocks afloat
397 2018-12-17 21:47:20 Why? You buy back stocks with tax cuts they go up, you cash in at their peak, they slump... called pendulum
398 2018-12-17 21:46:02 Handpicked stocks...reason being the stocks would be having a better stand off from the beginning of next year compared to mutual funds and savings bond
399 2018-12-17 21:45:54 Note to self, don’t read ft article on stocks sliding and then check stock portfolio . But on the plus point Severn toll is now gone so.....
400 2018-12-17 21:45:51 Stocks, at least it's not crypto!
401 2018-12-17 21:45:37 If I owned stocks I'd probably be really mad
402 2018-12-17 21:45:37 Few could dispute this statements simplicity that less fishing will rebuild overfished stocks. The question that confounds us is how to move from State A to B, esp. in fisheries where fishers have few if any alternatives, govts don't invest in mgmt & RBM solutions are complicated
403 2018-12-17 21:45:19 I'm just trying to do basic shit as Mk and Issy and I'd lose stocks or games because it
404 2018-12-17 21:45:16 I put it more on the sellers of stocks but the absence of buyers should not be ignored
405 2018-12-17 21:45:15 Exactly. When a controlling party abuses their power, n makes laws that allows them to collect lobby favors, inside info on stocks, ability to buy land, get free stuff, make money on assets & business'. These are still gifts, just by another name. It's unethical/wrong/immoral.
406 2018-12-17 21:44:16 Just looked at the stock market today. Thought it would probably be up a few hundred or down 300+ points. 

It was down... Really down. 

If this stays the same (even with a few "up" days) we'll have the worst December for stocks since the great depression (1931)

407 2018-12-17 21:44:09 Trumpster logic:
Stocks do well = trump is the best president ever
Stocks tumble = it's a correction because the market was overinflated
408 2018-12-17 21:43:29 They also buy the losing stocks and gain more ownership of companies, consolidating their grip on the market.
409 2018-12-17 21:43:21 why are stocks going down?

because people are selling

why are they selling?

because stocks are going down
410 2018-12-17 21:43:04 Stocks go up...I get nothing...stocks go down...I get laid off...
411 2018-12-17 21:42:51 Big drop in stocks today but market is 33% above where Obama left off.  #MAGA 
412 2018-12-17 21:42:26 Because of Trumps tariffs stocks closed at a negative 502. Great
 Businessman right?
413 2018-12-17 21:42:04 Vote to close the loophole of allowing Congress to trade stocks which they are voting on.  It is legalized insider trading.  You, congress should not be allowed to do that.
414 2018-12-17 21:41:54 In all this, it be the boy ein stocks the rise.
415 2018-12-17 21:41:43 Robinhood customers are given 100% of the dividends generated by the stocks they've purchased. We don't keep any!
416 2018-12-17 21:41:40 Rich democrats manipulated the stocks today.
 Their going to get caught and it will cost them
417 2018-12-17 21:41:15 Anyone else out there who is tired of all this WINNING while watching our stocks plummet day after day?
418 2018-12-17 21:40:54 We split our extra this year between paying down mortgage and buying stocks.  The mortgage half definitely had a better return on the year!
419 2018-12-17 21:40:31 You can tell the uranium stocks that any kind of fund might have owned today. Margin calls and sell programs kicked in hard. This is one of the scenarios we knew could come. My saving grace is that all of my regular market money is in cash and four times the size of my spec.
420 2018-12-17 21:40:27 I hate all that "Buy now while stocks last!"
"You must see this movie!" "Stop on a red light!" 
I'll make my own mind up, thanks.
421 2018-12-17 21:39:57 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
422 2018-12-17 21:39:53 I hear you... Are there any statistics that show how many stocks actually go down to the phase 1 level? % wise? This is really interesting..
423 2018-12-17 21:39:43 Stocks go up an down but  the robust Trump market will continue on because of the lower corporate tax and job growth.
424 2018-12-17 21:38:41 Stocks to New York primary win £1000!
425 2018-12-17 21:37:50 Did he define “collapse in stocks”?
426 2018-12-17 21:37:40 This is the perfect FOMO in & stocks can bounce after FED meeting with the interests rates increase... or not.
427 2018-12-17 21:37:32 I think you mean stocks “dive” not “dove”. The word dove will come into play Wednesday during Powell’s decision on interest rates.
428 2018-12-17 21:36:59 Nn on les stocks... 
429 2018-12-17 21:36:53 463 stocks in the S&P 500 were down today.... $SPY $SPX
430 2018-12-17 21:36:50 Forgetting about intraday nonsense, this is a straight line down all month in US stocks, down 9%. Recent high 3Dec 240 S&P points ago.
431 2018-12-17 21:36:48 I work at a private company and I am not allowed to own stocks.  Only ETFs or mutual funds. That’s how Congress should work.
432 2018-12-17 21:36:36 Agreed! So many stocks down > 20-30%. Next move, buy value stocks when this political mess is over.
433 2018-12-17 21:36:28 The proposal to ban holding/trading individual stocks doesn't go far enough. A legislator could still use insider knowledge and/or influence policy decisions to make a large sum of money trading sector-based ETFs. Defense and pharmaceutical sector-based ETFs are prime examples.
434 2018-12-17 21:36:16 Je vais venir te voir pour te raconter ma nuit dans les stocks
435 2018-12-17 21:36:07 Tengo que volver a meterle duro a los stocks 
436 2018-12-17 21:35:51 Does "take the victory" mean "sell all of your stocks now?" Because that's the interpretation the market has. Good job, @realDonaldTrump !
437 2018-12-17 21:35:41 Looking at financials, oil, and gun stocks. First two for short term trades, gun stocks as a longer term play.
438 2018-12-17 21:35:22 The 10-period ADX turned UP from 28 to 31 with today's close in the Dow..has been a good indicator at predicting short-term bottom closing prices. Time to bid for a few Dow stocks here. (that's why the futs popped after the close as all the bots figured it out) $DIA $SPX $Nasdaq
439 2018-12-17 21:35:05 @yoni Look for Larry Kudow to start a PR tour to try & save #stocks. There is no place to hide X-cash or short. $AAPL, $NFLX $FB $GS $JNJ $PPG Blue chips getting slaughtered. Im up ~ 16% shorting every day. Ive survived a #bearmarket. Have you ?
440 2018-12-17 21:34:59 Wages aren't the problem. Wages are earned, income from stocks and investments are where the corrupting influences come in. If a member of Congress owns stock in Industry A, they will always have a self-interest when governing/regulating that industry.
441 2018-12-17 21:34:50 Thanks Obama! Dow Industrials Fall 508 Points as Investors Fret Over Growth
U.S. stocks slumped as investors looked ahead to this week’s Federal Reserve meeting amid mounting signs of slowing economic growth around the world.
442 2018-12-17 21:34:43 It took investors who bought #stocks in August 1929, 25 years to break even on their purchases, not counting the #dividends. 
We are now in a #bear market.  Do not buy dips!
#DowJones #StockMarket #stocks #Futures #OptionsTrading
443 2018-12-17 21:34:29 Not to mention, it’s the Dow.  The Dow is a handful of stocks and is constantly adjusted. 

I’ll stick with GDP, employment data, etc to judge the economic conditions
444 2018-12-17 21:34:23 Tech stocks that have defied the market rout got hit pretty hard today.

MDB -8.5%

445 2018-12-17 21:34:15 Cheers Thom. Got a lot of help from some great guys... @RonStoeferle @LukeGromen @Lee_Adler @CurrencyWar1 among others. Just put the pieces of the puzzle together. "#Liquidity is all the matters to stocks." = the key!
446 2018-12-17 21:34:03 Justement. 
Il faut écouler les stocks, maintenant que ça se sait...
447 2018-12-17 21:34:02 Health Insurance stocks tank when ACA is perceived at risk like today, and soar when ACA is legislated and enforced. Makes me think Obama and Dems wrote ACA to benefit health insurance profits. Not to offer healthcare.
448 2018-12-17 21:33:59 It took investors who bought #stocks in August 1929, 25 years to break even on their purchases, not counting the #dividends.

450 2018-12-17 21:33:26 I remember Trump stating  that "when Stocks drop dramatically its totally the fault of the POTUS"  he wil change his tune now
451 2018-12-17 21:32:54 It is so fulfilling to see $btc and and the rest of crypto in green 
Whilst stocks plunge .... 

Crypto does get the bad end of the stick .. 
Not rightly so .. There are legit projects still working hard and building ..
452 2018-12-17 21:32:54 How are your stocks doing Donald?
453 2018-12-17 21:32:52 I see your 2008 mining stocks and raise you 2008 solar stocks.
454 2018-12-17 21:32:40 The only "stocks" congressmen/women should be allowed to invest in is an SP500 index fund. Then their interests will align with the overall health of our economy.
455 2018-12-17 21:32:40 This just means stocks are as cheap as they were a year ago on average
456 2018-12-17 21:32:26 Together they amassed more than $11 trillion of additional stocks, bonds  and other financial assets. Repeat $ 11 T bought by Central Banks in the Greatest

457 2018-12-17 21:31:56 They've most all taken larger hits during past weeks - prior to ruling. 

Point here being, Michael, had healthcare stocks taken tumbles becasue of anything Obama had done, without any question in the world, you'd be out celebrtating and cheering it on.

Pretty cheap journalism.
458 2018-12-17 21:31:37 If you know enough about individual stocks, and as a reporter, holding individual stocks in companies I may cover is very dicey. So, mutual funds for me, for those reasons and more.
459 2018-12-17 21:31:30 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @DanScavino Those Selling Off On FEELINGS & Fears Stocks: Let Them! Lowering Costs Of Investments for MANY to BUY LOW & SELL HIGH! U don’t let feelings Rule Investments. Much Unrest Because FAKE NEWS Believed & Done Purposely To Try Ruin @POTUS 2020 Run!
460 2018-12-17 21:31:18 Do you mean the stocks that got hit today are the ones that were not previously hit?
461 2018-12-17 21:30:44 UST IN: Dow Jones tumbles more than 500 points, as health insurers and hospitals reel from a judge's ruling that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional. Retailers and technology stocks are also sinking.
462 2018-12-17 21:30:39 $14 billion to bail out farmers?! General Motors closing plants?!investing in dying industries, stocks market tanking. declared BK SIX TIMES! Huge trade deficits. Huger debt. Any gain on gdp are temporary until bills come due on the debt he signed us up for. Hello?

464 2018-12-17 21:30:12 Meanwhile stocks dropped another 500+ today.  Your setting records for the most and highest daily drops on the Dow by a President ever.  Way to go Mr. ineptitude! You own it now just as Obama owned it a short time ago when it was peaking!
465 2018-12-17 21:30:02 Win or lose, everybody gets what they want out of the market. #forex #stocks
466 2018-12-17 21:29:48 Will a buyback bottom work this time around? Doubtful. Companies have spent $700 billion on buybacks this year and stocks have essentially fallen steadily since February!
467 2018-12-17 21:29:46 This bizarre double standard on a site heavily populated by, for example, the afore mentioned bears, led to a strike in the hope that there would be a short sharp shock to their stocks or shares or whatever rich people huff their cocaine through these days. 6/?
468 2018-12-17 21:29:43 $spy gez... I remember da days when I checked stocks which were going down and I said hedge fund x or market wizard z is buying it... to myself: what an idiot lol
469 2018-12-17 21:29:18 these 2 stocks, Buffett bought in 2016 and 2017.. SyF and STOR.. one is still at the top & other came back down to original purchase price.. Stor was fundamentally very strong compared to SYF at the time of purchase. STOR is holding b/c of REIT.
470 2018-12-17 21:29:05 *checks portfolio* 4% loss YTD... let's see that turn to 24%. Jackal wants him some cheap stocks!

473 2018-12-17 21:28:37 Great time to buy. US Stock market always rebounds. Emulate success such as Buffett. Go index funds and not single stocks. Opportunity always awaits those who weather market.

476 2018-12-17 21:28:03 Liars. All of em. I'm glad Verizon stocks are tanking because of this.
477 2018-12-17 21:27:52 Another day another down market worldwide. Fear is driving the market beyond what is reasonable given any reasonable worst case. If market continues down another 2-4%, odds are buying quality stocks will payoff. For the more cautious, money market funds are a good deal at 2+%.

481 2018-12-17 21:26:44 I am happy that Texas MLS teams will not be laughing-stocks of the league anymore because of awful mid-week first round attendance figures.  I don't like that the Dynamo are less likely to ever see home playoff matches in the new have/have not MLS world.
482 2018-12-17 21:26:31 He's selling his stocks.
483 2018-12-17 21:26:15 Way to go Trumpykins! Worst stock market year since 2008 at the moment. Why do you flap your oversized trap when stocks are up but conveniently tweet about stupid/Trump stuff when stocks get crushed?
484 2018-12-17 21:26:10 Take a look at stocks - my 401K now droping like a stone - he is USELESS!!!
485 2018-12-17 21:26:00 How many of these established FURU's conspire to buy large blokes of low float penny stocks amongst themselves B4 running up the scanners premarket then dumping on their subs? How else can these pops happen on no news?
486 2018-12-17 21:25:50 I can see it now from #DishonestDon:  "Just in time for your late IRA contribution, I've arranged for stocks to be on sale.  During my administration, we've never had prices this low!"
487 2018-12-17 21:25:31 It was 25 PE very recently and of course in 2009 it hit 5 PE at the bottom so there’s no reason to believe it can’t do so again and thus stocks loose 75% even from these levels
488 2018-12-17 21:24:46 LOL- No Sir,u are too busy staring at Trump's APPENDIX to realize he's a liar & a Crook. How's ur Stocks today? Hey I guess u have healthcare huh?  Wanna bet u don't do CRAP to the Saudis?  Hey how many kids did u pay to have killed in Yemen today?  Sir- ur Hypocrisy is Stunning
489 2018-12-17 21:24:41 Who gives a fuck about fundamentals, stocks must grow. No further discussions needed.
490 2018-12-17 21:24:13 What about the DOW? All the money I made, is slipping away in the stocks...what about that?
491 2018-12-17 21:24:09 Wasn't that when the Obama admin blocked the transfer of precision guided weapons? Could have been a downtick to preserve stocks until the new admin took over.
492 2018-12-17 21:24:09 He already doesn't have an economy to tout. He just lies about how it's doing so great, even though ANYONE with stocks know that they've lost all gains for the whole year. You're better off putting your cash in a mattress than in the stock market right now.
493 2018-12-17 21:23:57 How much of a threat are investors to a company if that company's CEO decides to simply not play along with the current social justice theories? If he instead just listens to the market and bases his actions on that? I mean he'd make more money right? Better stocks that way?

497 2018-12-17 21:23:03 My stocks don't look stronger than ever today, aren't you still taking credit for everything ya big dummy?
498 2018-12-17 21:22:56 IMO, when elected to federal office, your assets should be entrusted to a federal corporation set up by Congress. You can sell stocks before entering office, but once in office, your assets are off limits for manipulation.
499 2018-12-17 21:22:26 The stocks are dropping and you say our economy is stronger then ever. We are dealing with a huge deficit. Where is the money coming from for the farmers, how is that winning? You won an award BTW, the Golden Idiot Award, take a bow
500 2018-12-17 21:22:20 Economy stronger than ever! Hear that, #MAGAts? Go on out & buy stocks! The fact that the Dow is down almost 5% for ALL of 2018 means nothing! Obama's people are rigging the indexes! Stocks are really good! Your 401Ks are great! President Trump says so! You're all gonna be rich!!
501 2018-12-17 21:22:15 Tim, I hope your right. Anything is better than OBAMA, but, please AMERICA STOP SELLING YOUR STOCKS, BUY, there’s no bad news out there.

504 2018-12-17 21:21:29 I still don’t understand why everybody looking for possible recession to get bearish stocks.  Stocks peaked March 2000; recession didn’t come until March 2001.   Stocks peaked Oct. 2007; recession didn’t come until Oct. 2008.  You are too late if you wait for recession.
505 2018-12-17 21:21:14 You must own zero stocks. or a bot.
506 2018-12-17 21:21:05 I like how presidant T is working hard to make stocks affordable for regular folks!!#maga
507 2018-12-17 21:20:54 yeah be very skeptical of stocks and banks in 2019
508 2018-12-17 21:20:28 Seriously guys, log off! I'm seeing Verizon's stocks slowly rising. We have to show that we don't approve of this dumb ban. #TumblrLogOff #tumblrprotest
509 2018-12-17 21:20:04 Them bamboo and sugarcane stocks
510 2018-12-17 21:20:02 Wait. Where is my subsidy?  I’m retired, on a fixed income, my stocks are tanking, every time social security gets a tiny raise, my Medicare payment goes up. And now my taxes have gone up. Nice job Tariff Man.
511 2018-12-17 21:20:01 Oh really?? Stocks, having to pay our farmers because of his foolishness. Deficit higher then ever before and climbing and lying all@day long to everyone? You find that good? Then you are in trouble,
512 2018-12-17 21:20:01 "S&P Slump Trump" strikes again...stocks take a nosedive once more.. Thanks @realDonaldTrump
513 2018-12-17 21:18:26 As you can see by the chart I just posted SP500 is about 20PE right now and it can overshoot on the downside to 10PE thus stocks loosing 50% of value next year
514 2018-12-17 21:18:24 Stocks
S(T)ink !
515 2018-12-17 21:18:24 "Stocks slumped again on Monday, sending the S&P 500 stock index to its lowest level of the year, as investors looked to a Federal Reserve decision later this week and limped toward the close of a challenging year"
516 2018-12-17 21:18:01 Very interesting that #Bitcoin had a positive correlation to #Gold today as capital flowed out of #stocks and the market plummeted 
517 2018-12-17 21:18:01 There are times to own stocks, when inflation and growth are accelerating, its notnrocket science but people put more effort into drawing lines on a chart rather than macro analysis.
518 2018-12-17 21:17:57 Severe pain because the retail investor will be sucked in by violent bounces of 500 Dow points, only to get stuck when it erases it en route to new lows. #China deal will spike it and @federalreserve will spike it when they admit they r buying stocks $QQQ $SPX $QQQ
519 2018-12-17 21:17:52 Too many stocks at their 52 week lowest right now to not partake! Happy Cyber Monday!
520 2018-12-17 21:17:45 I chose a bad year to buy stocks
521 2018-12-17 21:17:40 I wanna get back into trading stocks but the markets been red af the last few months 
522 2018-12-17 21:17:31 lol, precisely not true. I study stocks and invest. Where did you get this b.s. falsity? 1-trillion, yes TRILLION dollars of stock buy backs happened with his tax giveaway to the rich.
523 2018-12-17 21:17:28 Sticks.... stocks I will only have sticks the way things are going 
524 2018-12-17 21:17:21 Should’ve parlayed some of that into some stocks n bonds 
525 2018-12-17 21:17:16 This isn't close to being over. I'm staying short consumer stocks.
526 2018-12-17 21:17:04 Smoke it if ya got it.  A friend with weed is a friend indeed.  Don't bogart that joint, my friend, pass it over to me....Hey man I thought the CEO said $TLRY was defensive stock and a hedge against booze and tobacco stocks...WTF?
527 2018-12-17 21:16:49 Surely that’s a legit possibility?  Stocks wo ++ cash and no earnings can get hammered if ppl think a bear market coming.
528 2018-12-17 21:16:31 Guess we can stop talking about a  rally for #stocks this year.
529 2018-12-17 21:16:27 Maybe they should have to get rid of certain type of stocks, before they take office.
530 2018-12-17 21:16:11 This is a sad day. But good news, Verizon Stocks lost yet another dollar (they're the ones who own Dumblr now, and since the annoncement of the porn ban, they lost between 4 or 5 dollars of value per stock. From 60 to 56.)
531 2018-12-17 21:16:00 Almost never watch CNBC. But had late lunch on this down day&tuned in for grins. Hosts noted EVERY sector was down. When highlighting stocks outperforming -LULU mentioned-down, but not much. Meanwhile, I'm sitting with all my longs UP. They refuse to utter 4-letter "G" (gold)word
532 2018-12-17 21:15:56 #Jarvis is a new exchange that allows fiat, crypto, stocks, Forex and CFDs trading.  The assets can be utilized as a medium of exchange or of payment, as collateral for a loan or for contributing to a liquidity pool. @Jarvis_Edge
533 2018-12-17 21:15:30 A recent KIPPRA survey shows that Kwale topped the 47 counties with a satisfactory rate of 90 percent attributed to improved stocks of medical equipment & expanded medical facilities and personnel. The number of health facilities rose 35 percent to 147 by 2017, from 99 in 2013
534 2018-12-17 21:15:20 @foxandfriends @foxnewsalert @FoxBusiness talking about the Dow and stocks DROPPING...The biggest reason we are seeing this drop is because the market knows the democrats are going to take over the House! The market is not stupid! We will see even larger drops after january!
535 2018-12-17 21:15:11 Just got off the phone with my financial planner going to buy some great stocks at low prices
536 2018-12-17 21:15:01 Stocks got so tired of winning they're now losing over the last 14 month period.
537 2018-12-17 21:14:52 That is correct. And those mutual funds are comprised of company stocks and bonds. You can diversify through different bucket funds of these type of investments.

539 2018-12-17 21:14:39 True. Excellent buying opportunity for some amazing dividend paying stocks.
540 2018-12-17 21:14:34 Stocks only bottom on days without a "Y".
541 2018-12-17 21:14:31 How much did Amazon drop? Amazon wasn't a top 2%? If most of the bank stocks didn't drop even 70%,why did bitcoin drop 84%? Trying to make you realize, you are selecting data that favors your positioning. The soonet you realizes this the less $$$ you will lose.
542 2018-12-17 21:14:21 2018 Christmas gift for myself: Purchased 7 stocks listed on the Jamaica Stock Exchange.
543 2018-12-17 21:14:18 Stocks close slightly slower, trimming earlier losses
544 2018-12-17 21:14:16 It's not even a complicated fix.  I work for a company that interacts with hundreds of clients.  We're allowed to invest, but only in mutual funds or other stocks where there's no direct control of the portfolio.  The end.
545 2018-12-17 21:14:09 Congratulations 
546 2018-12-17 21:14:08 Best part of following stocks is trying to make sense of our markets. Gold goes up and all gold stock sell off go figure. $1251.00 US up almost to $10.00 an ounce majority of gold stocks sells off up-to 10% Wow, embarrassing.  
547 2018-12-17 21:13:57 Actually, as bad as this selloff seems, it is setting up an amazing buying opportunity for stocks that were pretty top heavy before this correction.

That's why they call it a correction.  It corrects an overbought situation.
548 2018-12-17 21:13:48 The Dow Jones is sliding again today. Worst month for stocks in 3 years.
549 2018-12-17 21:13:41 The stocks are going down like crazy DOW is down by over 500 points looks like that Trump economy isn't working out too well.

555 2018-12-17 21:12:32 Stocks - Dow Downed as Investors Flee Risk on Fed Fears
556 2018-12-17 21:12:26 #stocks Dow and S&P500 have given up an entire year of gains as of this morning.  It's got nothing to do with the administrations policies though!
557 2018-12-17 21:12:03 Kind of like what James Inhofe, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, did when he purchased Raytheon stocks after advocating for a defense budget increase. Our gov't is so corrupt-It's a big $ grab for them. It's not about working on behalf of us-it's abt enriching themselves
558 2018-12-17 21:12:02 They should just seize all their money, assets and stocks permanently and then pay a really high salary like $750,000 with benefits and pension
559 2018-12-17 21:11:54 Just this year bro, I’m not long stocks when my macroeconomic analysis and leading indicators show growth is slowing and Fed is willing to hike right into it, just like 2015-2016......and unlike 2016-2017.
560 2018-12-17 21:11:31 You pot heads gotta start smoking some more. My stocks aren’t doing to hot
561 2018-12-17 21:11:29 I love this pic of you!!! You look gorgeous and you’re having fun!  Plus literally every person should have a picture of themselves in stocks!
562 2018-12-17 21:11:28 Congratulations!!! :)
563 2018-12-17 21:11:25 Stocks tumble bigly

565 2018-12-17 21:10:54 I haven't turned on the news today but judging from the stock market dt didn't die yet, right? I believe when he finally goes, hopefully in tremendous pain as befits a traitor, the stocks will sky rocket and the World will breath a collective sigh of relief! Don't think so? WAIT!
566 2018-12-17 21:10:28 Stocks suffer a ghastly session as more investors throw in the towel on the 9-yr-old bull mkt. Dow ends -507, -2.1% to 23,592.

Nasdaq -2.3%. S&P -2.1% to new 52-wk low.

Losers swamp winners 26/4 on NYSE.

Does the Fed dare raise rates this week with this mkt backdrop?
567 2018-12-17 21:10:24 "55% of S&P 500 stocks are down over 20% from their 52-week highs." 
- @bespokeinvest
568 2018-12-17 21:10:19 Pretty dreary Mon afternoon for stocks, specially after last wk. Dow -507 pts/-2.1% at 23,592; S&P -2.1%; Nasdaq -2.3%; Russell -2.4%. WTI -.3.9%/$49.24; 10-yr 2.860%. VIX 25.42. #markets #federalreserve #economy @anthonymace
569 2018-12-17 21:09:44 Hopefully people who didn’t vote for him are smart enough not to liquidate their 401Ks during a downturn. I am about 70% cash and haven’t bought any stocks since February. Yes I lost all my gains for the year, but I’ll gladly take the pain bc market is only thing propping him up
570 2018-12-17 21:09:40 "Worry is growing on Wall Street as stocks get slammed ahead of a big Fed decision.".......The soap droppers at Yahoo didn't bother mentioning WHEN the Fed decision will be announced. What idiots
571 2018-12-17 21:09:32 Remember in Feb 2016 when everyone ABSOLUTELY adamant oil going to $10 ( press /SKY/Bloomberg etc)....when oil was dicing with death at $29/28/27/25....???...  went on biggest bull run in 10yrs.....just saying

572 2018-12-17 21:09:28 Stocks go down, $BTC goes
573 2018-12-17 21:09:00 Stocks up hard off the bottom, and that’s the level from February.  2532.00. It’s a big one.  Does it hold?  Maybe today.  But we got a lot of work today to make any case for stocks to rally.  Dec hike odds moved, but not a crazy amount today given what other markets did.
574 2018-12-17 21:08:58 It hasn’t. I “implied” that the French stopped fishing to allow stocks to increase, the British ignored that.

It makes it easier to spot new out of stocks and chase items where stock is available in different pack.

582 2018-12-17 21:06:01 Most lithium stocks have been smashed over the last 6mths and even more so in the last 3 mths.
I believe the big players are creating havoc and buying up all the cheap shares!!
583 2018-12-17 21:05:59 I have to agree. This is mostly a trend at the moment. It's just a small dip and doesn't reflect a proper sample of the stocks value 'yet'.

586 2018-12-17 21:05:32 Stocks on edge? Ocare ruled unconstitutional and healthcare industries lose across the board. Anybody else out there see the thread here?
587 2018-12-17 21:05:30 The S&P 500 Index fell though February’s low, led by the technology, health-care and consumer sectors. Insurance stocks plunged after a Friday court ruling jeopardized Obamacare, while Johnson & Johnson sank on fresh worries its asbestos scandal will intensify.
588 2018-12-17 21:05:30 More than half of S&P 500 stocks are now in a bear  market
589 2018-12-17 21:05:26 Stocks continue to dive. The Dow closed at 23,592.98, down 507.53 (-2.11%) Nasdaq -2.27%. S&P -2.08%.
590 2018-12-17 21:04:58 Statistically there is a 100% chance of a TurnAround Tuesday. Just a tiny bit under 100%, but we can round up because, pfft, there's no way stocks could go lower again so pretty much guaranteed a huge rally tomorrow (not financial advice).

592 2018-12-17 21:04:37 Wright brothers up, up, and away.  Stocks not so much!  My IRA just keeps dissolving.  Of course next day it is up 500 points you will pound your drum.  Not a word again today as it slides back to previous years levels.  Shh everyone can you hear him sweating!
593 2018-12-17 21:04:31 lollll the news just said if stocks keep going the way they are this is gonna b the worst december since the great depression
594 2018-12-17 21:04:28 Robinhood is OK.  The liquidity sucks for anything other than mainstream stocks.  Currently lookin around for a better broker.
595 2018-12-17 21:04:26 I spent most of the day appeasing five cats and cleaning litters, so not bad day!

Looking at the stocks, and the fact that I can't actually see the iTunes page, it's had a very loud effect - whether or not staff agrees to it, I suppose :Tc.
596 2018-12-17 21:04:20 I said top 2% only Zoltan.  Please see that I have noted that in the infographics.  I saw that during the dotcom crashed as well.  Companies like Apple and Cisco only dropped 85% and then it stopped.  Most of the top bank stocks did not drop even 70% during the 2008 crash.
597 2018-12-17 21:04:19 Have a plan and stick to it. Just be sure you know the level of risk you’re taking and theexpected risk/return of your portfolio.  E.g. if you’re close to retirement and are 100% invested in stocks using a buy & hold strategy, that’s probably too much risk.
598 2018-12-17 21:04:18 Still up 35% since he got elected. Meanwhile when it was up EVEN MORE you'd be saying, "Only rich white people have stocks anyway." Disingenuous shitlord.

601 2018-12-17 21:04:06 The tax "cuts" to the businesses resulted in 1 trillion dollars of buybacks for stocks. Not exactly diversion into the economy as @realDonaldTrump had thought or pretended. Middle class and retirement accounts are crumbling.

608 2018-12-17 21:03:24 BREAKING: STOCKS PLUNGE AGAIN.

When Trump told #MAGA voters to buy stocks, the smart money started selling.

DJIA:

Jan 30: 26,439

Dec 17: 23,593

If you took Trump's advice to buy stocks during his 2018 #SOTU address, you are now down 11%, even as inflation continues to rise.
609 2018-12-17 21:03:09 Stocks drop ahead—MAGA recession coming
610 2018-12-17 21:02:56 Should I sell off all my stocks? This is getting ridiculous.
611 2018-12-17 21:02:38 June 2018: Too bad only half of Americans own stocks
December 2018: Good thing only half of Americans own stocks
612 2018-12-17 21:02:19 Stocks have reached what looks like a permanently low plateau.

632 2018-12-17 20:57:45 Even though #stocks having been dropping a lot  the last number of days I’m not buying until there is a full blown recession
633 2018-12-17 20:57:11 The best tell to buy the piss out of stocks will be when this joker @michaelsantoli starts to get concerned. He has been complacent the whole way down, only reason to watch CNBC is the counter trade of the furus (yup f'ing gurus).
634 2018-12-17 20:56:58 FED's agenda is - like many (all?) Central Banks - to be recognised as ontop of "things". Right now it's unclear what constitutes "things" because FF futures and stocks reflect opposing sentiment. The FED will have to show it's hand...very interesting meeting coming up
635 2018-12-17 20:56:57 @realDonaldTrump hey excuse me, Mr greatest president sir? Will you please sign the farm bill so my pot stocks make me rich? After that you can cancel it if you want  thank you! #4moreyears
636 2018-12-17 20:56:10 Still got big bucks riding on one of the hottest stocks in the hottest sectors. My early investor 12x gains have weight.

638 2018-12-17 20:55:55 #Stocks trading near the lows of the day. Must be Trumps fault... #CNBC #Bloomberg #FakeNews
639 2018-12-17 20:55:52 55% of S&P 500 stocks are down over 20% from their 52-week highs while 44% are down 25%.
640 2018-12-17 20:55:45 Nibbling some stocks near the close here...



 ...should be okay.
            
641 2018-12-17 20:55:36 Did I mention these cute fragrance gift sets to you? You pick any of our fragrances & either an Epic mascara or a Lucractive lip gloss & you get a big discount plus a free bag! Nice hey??  They are only offer until December 31st while stocks last 
642 2018-12-17 20:55:27 Sold nearly all my stocks in August. Got it right for once!
643 2018-12-17 20:55:06 Sellabration specials starting today until Thursday 20/12/18 or while stocks last!!
644 2018-12-17 20:55:04 what a day stocks are falling @Nasdaq and crypto is raising!! Looking forward to these days in future!!
645 2018-12-17 20:54:42 Yes, all the lovely hmv stores have it while stocks last 
646 2018-12-17 20:54:36 "Terrible market"? Yes, if you're on the long side. No, if you're short. All shorts in my portfolio are doing great. Thanks to @TurboTradingbiz for alerting stocks and leading trades.

648 2018-12-17 20:54:21 This is a sick market, and probably the easiest way for stocks to sustain a rally is when all the big players are gone (next week).  But when they come back after New Year's, it's probably going to be more selling.
649 2018-12-17 20:54:11 Stocks falling bigtime at market close!
650 2018-12-17 20:53:57 Dude, your BS is messing with my stocks!!!!!!
651 2018-12-17 20:53:47 I bet Trump will blame someone for manipulating stocks in the upcoming weeks.

Just not sure who will be blamed, Soros, the House Democrats who obstruct or maybe the FED
652 2018-12-17 20:53:22 I could turn up the sound and listen to Charlie Gasperino but I already know he is saying he is a friend of President Trump and then he is talking badly about him and talking down the stocks.
653 2018-12-17 20:52:55 #SP500 hits a new 52-week low today #stocks #StockMarket #markets #investments #investing #WallStreet #Finance #economics #economy
654 2018-12-17 20:52:49 US stocks drop to a 14-month low and Trump wants to shutdown the Government AND have a Trade war. So much Winning from the #MAGA gang.
655 2018-12-17 20:52:45 A true picture of the economy is the bond market which is freezing up. No big deals in the past 10 years. But the trump base believes a person who has had at least 6 Bankruptcies because of reckless behavior. Last year stocks averaged 20%. This year is Flat because of trump.
656 2018-12-17 20:52:39 Weak stocks bounce and strong stocks sell off! It’s all pretty gross action!
657 2018-12-17 20:52:29 $SPX #stock $DRI set to report #earnings Tuesday before market open; other names reporting before tomorrow's open include #midcap #stocks $FDS $NAV and $WOR #trading

661 2018-12-17 20:51:40 @ASavageNation Look at how far the Dow has fallen, Look at bank stocks how far they have sold off, look at China exchange down 26% this year!  The dow is headed to 5500
662 2018-12-17 20:51:31 Acceleration down into the close.  Outlier day.  Study it, don't make a final determination from it.  

In difficult markets, stocks tend to move from weak hands to strong hands, their rightful owners.  In midst of this, weak hands often grab for the wrong replacement.
663 2018-12-17 20:51:29 You invest that shit into cannabis stocks and watch that bitch riiiiiissseee

665 2018-12-17 20:51:15 Situations that can greatly impact RB situation in 2019. If Saints let Mark Ingram leave and if Falcons cut Devonta Freeman. Both Alvin Kamara and Tevin Coleman stocks will soar if so. #FantasyFootball #FantasyFootballAdvice

668 2018-12-17 20:50:17 Actually a lot of stocks are like that in Canada.  Wonder who is responsible?  Couldn't be!  Yes, you guessed it.
669 2018-12-17 20:50:05 Stocks are diving again. Gold is steady as it should be. #wealthpreservation
670 2018-12-17 20:49:36 Fun fact: the last time the Fed went ahead anyway and raised rates with stocks this weak was 1994.
671 2018-12-17 20:49:25 my stocks are melting ahhhhhhh do something @realDonaldTrump hurry the f up
672 2018-12-17 20:49:04 Eurozone stocks RIP tomorrow
673 2018-12-17 20:48:14 Since Bitcoin is up today while stocks are down clearly money is flowing into crypto as a hedge for the upcoming apocalypse
674 2018-12-17 20:48:13 @SaraEisen @WilfredFrost You know what that means guys when everybody sentiment is the world is ending and we’re off 16% S&P highs. That’s when you buy good quality stocks with growth and value.
675 2018-12-17 20:48:08 Cool, all my favorite stocks are on sale!
676 2018-12-17 20:48:08 Why pick only BTC? You have plenty of other digital assets, dotcom tech stocks to prove your point wrong. Cherry picking what suits your position is no objective way to invest/trade.
677 2018-12-17 20:47:58 Hey @realDonaldTrump why are my #stocks #crashing?
678 2018-12-17 20:47:56 Crypto guys be like:  man thank God I'm not in stocks
679 2018-12-17 20:47:54 Stocks are down 15% just since October, are now down for the entire year, and are at their lowest point in 13 months. That seems bad, is that bad? #DJIA
680 2018-12-17 20:47:37 Stocks are down today :)
681 2018-12-17 20:47:32 This is why call premium and dividend stocks are essential. Does anyone really go to cash in time?
682 2018-12-17 20:47:23 Buy the fear. Selling ootm naked puts for stocks I don’t might being assigned like $AMZN and buying calls since it can rally big into Wednesday.
683 2018-12-17 20:47:10 He’s not going to take that bet given his views on stocks.  Gold versus BTC would be an interesting bet though
684 2018-12-17 20:47:08 Crude in whack-a-mole mode. Luckily, $TSLA is here to save the day. I wrote some 380 calls last w, and plan to progressively keep rolling them until the stocks respond mkt conditions...
685 2018-12-17 20:46:47 Sold half of my leveraged long $btc position here.  Stocks in free fall.   I can’t see crypto holding this gain.
686 2018-12-17 20:46:28 bloody well time. (bloody for them, I don't have any material exposure to stocks)
687 2018-12-17 20:46:18 USD weakness has been the theme for the last 24 hours with stocks slipping and Oil back below $50 adding to negative sentiment as EUR has now retraced back to the 200 HMA at 1.1357. The NZD & AUD have had subdued sessions with CAD weakening on the Oil price.
688 2018-12-17 20:46:15 Stocks are overvalued interest rates are increasing so people are  selling risky stocks and buying into interest gaining investments like  bonds
689 2018-12-17 20:46:01 Boy you lost all three stocks to my shadow slash
690 2018-12-17 20:45:54 Stocks are never gonna rally again in our lifetime.

692 2018-12-17 20:45:38 The problem is...their greed! The tax cuts your daddy @realDonaldTrump gave to them, they used to inflate the cost of their own stocks. So give me a break that they give a shit about the average worker. #ivankasemails #TrumpCrimeFamily #TrumpRussiaCollusion
693 2018-12-17 20:45:25 They should NOT be separating families for months. Period.  donald is a disgrace a failure and an embarrassment. The deficit is higher than ever and I’m personally pissed that my stocks are decreasing value daily.
694 2018-12-17 20:45:25 I'm curious to find out what, if any, stocks are held by tRUmp and his family. He doesn't strike me as the sort who would put his money into the stock market to begin with.

708 2018-12-17 20:42:12 ? For Rev? How can we evaluate stocks when PE is not accurate. It requires an audit to determine value due to R&D, intrinsic value, creditability issues, etc. What is due diligence. There is always inherent risk. JNJ for example!
709 2018-12-17 20:42:05 You think stocks will outperform crypto over the next decade, Peter?
710 2018-12-17 20:41:38 I can press a button! Its why I trade stocks too haha.  Nice to know about Amazon but I never keep receipts and just troll companies instead when they let me down LOL. The twitter way.

716 2018-12-17 20:40:02 it seems like we're on this cliff in a mix of geopolitical fighting, longtime mainstays continuing to tank (retail), and people (finally!) realizing that some tech stocks are crap that's making everyone jumpy (and probably rightfully so?).
717 2018-12-17 20:39:51 stocks are killing me rn. at least crypto is back on the rise

723 2018-12-17 20:39:17 almost all stocks are doing bad and i dont know why D:
724 2018-12-17 20:39:03 Not many people who voted for El G own stocks.  El G will just blame it on the Fed, say their deep state and talk about how he will fix it if give, oh, about 4 more years.
725 2018-12-17 20:39:02 Buy stocks back then lay off employees, little to no severance, no pay raises, etc.
726 2018-12-17 20:38:34 I think only the fed can save stocks at this point.  Then hope no shutdown or temporary one. 
727 2018-12-17 20:38:21 #trade 3 Top Dividend Stocks With Yields Over 4%

These three stocks offer big yields but trade at low valuations.

729 2018-12-17 20:38:10 Tatiana this afternoon DC tweets and this weekend tweets affected stocks markets. In US and worldwide. Nothing to do with gov shutdown and trade. (Many are trying to give explanations.) I am explaining.
730 2018-12-17 20:37:54 Since I am primarily an equity guy and I was referring to money coming out of stocks and into crypto, usually a flight to quality would be to Treasuries.
731 2018-12-17 20:37:51 I wish sometimes that the $SPY $SPX big boards had trolls/ cults like sub penny cults (like $NHPI ,  for example)

Imagine being called a "paid basher" and an "idiot who does no due diligence" (etc.) when making successful bearish calls on big board stocks. 

That would be fun
732 2018-12-17 20:37:17 Since 1950:

734 2018-12-17 20:36:46 In US now, loyalty is punished, free agency rewarded. And none are more loyal that retirement accounts whose incumbency is leaned on like a stop order. Cell phones, Stocks, cable. Incentive to be disloyal. Public is sap. (Disjointed rant over)4/2
735 2018-12-17 20:36:36 I’m just getting alerts of stocks setting new lows every minute lmao this shit is brazy
736 2018-12-17 20:36:30 "In bull markets, stocks tend to open weak and close strong. In bear markets, they tend to open strong and close weak". Not quite a bear market yet, but the price action these last 5 days are a eerie testament to that quote. Bloodbath everywhere. hide yo kids hide yo wives $SPY

738 2018-12-17 20:35:47 So stocks are down again. The dems will not vote for funding the country, they will not vote for immigration reform that works, they refuse to vote for a legitimate health insurance or let ppl buy their own. Surprise, no. Stocks should be down with all this shit happening.
739 2018-12-17 20:35:30 Noah is a furie who trades stocks as a hobby.
740 2018-12-17 20:34:59 Knife catching is risky because stocks could erase the whole gain from 2016.
741 2018-12-17 20:34:59 $NYMO -71ish... that's starting to get it done now.  ;))  Stocks like $ZUO (and many others), starting to set up
742 2018-12-17 20:34:46 Banning adjustable stocks on rifles "because it makes shooting easier" is kinda like banning adjustable car seats because they make racing easier.

No, you're not wrong, but you are being a tad ridiculous.

Imaging driving your car with a "one size works for most" seat.
743 2018-12-17 20:34:46 Many MUNI CEF's acting more like stocks and dropping rather than like Treasuries which are rising as yields fall. Most of these bad boys are leveraged and had already been pricing higher financing, year-end effects at play.
744 2018-12-17 20:34:06 Uh, the economy? Or do you only take credit for the stocks when it’s your first week in office after 8 years of an upward swing under Obama...
745 2018-12-17 20:33:33 though I've always been told to keep investing even as it drops, since you'll be buying stocks at cheaper prices, benefiting you ~40 years in the future. though that might depend on financial goals/the specific account.
746 2018-12-17 20:33:24 Stocks tumbling again today. Are we winning yet?
747 2018-12-17 20:32:25 Not many stocks are green right now. In retail $TGT and $LB are down almost 5%. Best Buy $BBY really having a day down 7% after downgrade. #Retail #Business
748 2018-12-17 20:32:14 I know; he can learn something from COPS or border patrol.  Probably he has stocks on the construction company that is going to build the wall.
749 2018-12-17 20:31:46 If your plan is "Lean how to short after all my stocks fall 20%" you need a new plan.
750 2018-12-17 20:31:40 Is money flowing out of stocks into crypto today ??
751 2018-12-17 20:31:28 According to Steve Grosso retail stock buyers only think stocks go up. Is this true?
752 2018-12-17 20:31:23 I think everyone has talked themselves into a bear market 
It’s also so easy for people to sell stocks now it is happening fast
753 2018-12-17 20:31:16 Seems to me that crypto currencies are going up and tech stocks are going lower.
I wonder why that is .
754 2018-12-17 20:30:57 It’s counter intuitive to be bullish single stocks while bearish on the overall market. The general tide brings everything down.
755 2018-12-17 20:30:55 Meantime stocks are dropping through floor
756 2018-12-17 20:30:50 Stocks plunging in 5...4...3...2...
757 2018-12-17 20:30:19 Obamacare showed the it was the Dems who were really in bed with the big insurance companies. Now Obamacare delclaired illegal and their stocks plummet.
758 2018-12-17 20:30:17 Ooooh imagine a #FED hold this week. I doubt that would support #stocks though. If anything make things appear worse. @realDonaldTrump’s fiscal nitro boost has literally delivered too early - now for the PAIN. #dow to settle down 20% off highs?
759 2018-12-17 20:29:55 S&P 500 2018 low was 2,532.69 set on 2/9/18.  We’re about 0.25% from that level now (~2,540).  $VIX at 25, not massive panic selling to this point. #stocks
760 2018-12-17 20:29:19 3 stocks is better



2 stocks sucks


761 2018-12-17 20:29:14 I’ve added to my position in my top 5 stocks, bringing my average down in this current negative climate, if I’m right I will make some good gains coming up?, if I’m wrong some of these will get even cheaper and I’m locked in for who knows how long, it’s a “gamble” every day!
762 2018-12-17 20:29:08 DOW vs. S&P twitter is my fave. Dow: price-weighted (so weird), 30 stocks vs. S&P: value-weighted, 500 stocks. Historical correlation: massive. Why? Diversification! Jam 30 stocks into a portfolio, idiosyncratic risk magically disappears. DOW vs. S&P is a great example of this.
763 2018-12-17 20:28:56 Marc, all I know stocks or not, you are a man with big integrity and true to your words, win or lose.. I'm sure that @unemon1 recognize that by now.. 
I was very humbled and honored when I first met you and Max!! Rock on my friend GLTFA we will prevail
764 2018-12-17 20:28:25 also smart investors for long term growth go for funds, not individual stocks. and were seeing fine returns over our lifetimes.
765 2018-12-17 20:28:16 If I can get good luck and have my stocks jump 100% I’ll be happy
766 2018-12-17 20:28:15 Yep...good point 

Point being that AIM index down as these crazy 50+ PE stocks have finally been found out    feel free to add others 

BOO FDEV PLUS

All had huge market caps in Q2 2018
767 2018-12-17 20:27:45 I try to invest in stocks that are so wonderful that an idiot can run them.

In the case of $INTC, it was hit by multiple 10nm delays, Meltdown & Spectre bug, and CEO scandal. All these happened in 2018, yet its profits never stop growing!
768 2018-12-17 20:27:26 This year has been bad. Recession coming soon stocks are always first to show signs.
769 2018-12-17 20:26:40 All my stocks are down by 20-30% but I’m still up by 90.   I good at this investing shit.

Did stocks just ring the bell?
774 2018-12-17 20:25:44 Gold stocks are up 10-15% already in a month
775 2018-12-17 20:25:15 Seems that some have taken advantage of the quick fall of the stocks and extracted blood from the public. 

This really looks like the way that the Chinese communist regime manipulated the Chinese stock market with the purpose of benefiting the family of Chinese senior officials’

783 2018-12-17 20:24:09 So after 8 years of Obama a company finally has enough money to buy there stocks back that were sold cheap. I would say that’s a good sign, but the interest rates will be raised by the federal reserve to stifle the economy once again

824 2018-12-17 20:11:58 my advice for crypto twitter: learn to trade stocks (low risk + regulated market) and maybe even options (high risk + regulated market) before you try to trade crypto (high risk + unregulated market)
825 2018-12-17 20:11:49 Libs will push the economy is heading down bc of the Dow. Let me explain whats going on. Stocks sell off so investors buy treasury bonds which increases the treasury bond price in return lowers interest rates. This’s just an attempt to keep the feds from increasing interest rates

828 2018-12-17 20:10:23 buying stocks that are making new 52 week lows is not a deal
829 2018-12-17 20:10:20 2 stocks is not suitable for a game as fast as ultimate. With the gamespeed being this high, once you lost one stock early either to a combo or by accident, trying to get a comeback can be incredibly frustrating (esp with rage), while 3 stocks gives you more of a chance.
830 2018-12-17 20:09:38 I sold my stocks this morning and reinvested it into fox news for now I will move it around later this week
831 2018-12-17 20:09:12 I just went back below where I was at the beginning of this year in net worth of my stocks. I had hopes gaining a little ground this year but that hope is dwindling quickly.
832 2018-12-17 20:09:10 Stocks are getting cheaper. I LOVE this! The further this falls the better cash is to buy in at great value. Only fearful if you NEED to sell.

836 2018-12-17 20:06:59 Basically accumulating any time in that period and holding until December 2021 wouldn’t have matter. The key was accumulating. Just like stocks. Just make sure you are putting in....do you think I check each month when my 401k goes though? No.

We accumulate this year until 2021

838 2018-12-17 20:06:42 And the market sell-off continues. So I guess we can say that @realDonaldTrump was not good for stocks in 2018.

851 2018-12-17 20:04:17 Debt. Followed by things backed by lots of debt. Followed by collateral. So I'd put it in rough order of Bonds -> Property -> Derivatives -> Stocks. Adjustments then have to be made for the relative sizes of the current bubbles, but that would be my base case.

853 2018-12-17 20:03:42 The Gundlach interview on #CNBC was great other than it put the market down. Gundlach has been very right about things in general... We don't like to disagree with him. Tax loss selling also hitting stocks. Just very bearish out there.
854 2018-12-17 20:03:41 Some people are saying stocks are cheapest since 2012. I got news for ya - PE's, Price/Book, div yield, all that fundamental stuff doesn't matter one bit w/ forced liquidations or if we enter a bear market. Cheap get cheaper - and it can get way cheaper than you imagine $SPY

880 2018-12-17 19:55:24 During times like these, the only thing I buy are shares of dividend ETFs. Boring but safer and free commission for multiple adds since stocks usually keep falling.
881 2018-12-17 19:55:10 Not speculating on bottom. Just curious with recent debates, that transfer of funds from stocks to btc. could happen when btc bottom is reached and stocks has peaked. There could be a possibility that it could happen simultaneously. Not 100% that we haven’t reached bottom either.

902 2018-12-17 19:49:28 SSBU has fast enough game speed to warrant 3 stocks. Also, accidentally using a stock or losing a stock fast in a 2 stock game makes comebacks very frustrating, especially with rage being a thing as well. 3 stocks is the way to go with a game as fast as Ultimate.

906 2018-12-17 19:48:40 Since @pmarca's observation that internet companies, after starting in a bubble, were ultimately successful, I find myself wondering of every other bubble whether the same is true. Marijuana stocks seem to fit this. Bitcoin could go either way. What about the 2007 housing bubble?

910 2018-12-17 19:47:32 For example in New Zealand, you regularly see Chinese ships fishing in our exclusive economic zone without permission, they don’t give a shit if they destroy our fish stocks, they’ll just move on, but the people in NZ sure do

912 2018-12-17 19:46:45 I believe you are correct. As @DividendMaster says, “Rich people don’t sell stocks.” Income tax will migrate to a wealth tax. Which is double taxation, but bills aren’t being paid.

957 2018-12-17 19:34:07 yeah i know between the passive and central banks but even they cant stop the market when everyone wants out, it'll be real ugly

twice as bad because all these "passive" people arent completely passive: they're overexposed and levered to stocks - too much risk.... <cont>

968 2018-12-17 19:32:13 the yield curve was telling us

maybe we buy some time but i bet that would mean the market goes back to hammering long bonds higher in rates like we started to do before stocks topped

i think a couple more months and we get the same effect from much higher rates in long bonds

I asked one such deal why they are listing, I got 'cause people want to sell'

1012 2018-12-17 19:18:59 Or, it knew some cynical analyst might point out the stupidity of leaving U.S. export demand at 1.9 bb for the sole purpose of keeping ending stocks below 1 bb before it drops production in January, so it made up a bs rationale. 
Not that I know any cynical analysts, of course.

1039 2018-12-17 19:09:49 If crypto bottomed out and stocks are topped out (big what if). Then we could see that people from the stock market, tansfers wealth over to crypto for the hedge. At least i wouldn’t count the possibility out. I would guess there are similar historical examples with other assets.
1040 2018-12-17 19:09:41 Totally Agree.....

He should get a lifetime ban but first both Forest and Derby should set up a set of stocks outside each ground and he is put  in them on matchday.

He may then learn a lesson....
1041 2018-12-17 19:09:34 I need another guy my age who's also a cultural marxist but also knows which defense stocks are the best to buy in a bear market
1042 2018-12-17 19:09:16 Ask someone today if they had $1 million USD and had to hold for 20 years. No access to trading. Pick one holding and stay with that. How many would hold Cash or deposits in a bank or money markets. VS Stocks, Real Estate, Gold ( few would pick #bitcoin, I would). Cash devalues
1043 2018-12-17 19:09:06 Healthcare stocks being pummeled today after ruling against ACA. Ag and comsumer goods impacted by crazy trade policy, tourism, hotels, and ag by immigration, tax bill hit service industries... so much winning
1044 2018-12-17 19:08:05 Haha yup!! Stocks r just another form of gambling for us moron men. (I’m one of them) 
1045 2018-12-17 19:08:00 not a secret anymore...but few people are aware that #Apple has been regularly buying back their own stocks. this is how a corporation pimps up their market cap etc. one $ trillion...?
1046 2018-12-17 19:07:42 The GOP have had two years of total control, their legacy is massive deficit spending. So huge stocks are tanking again like 2008.
1047 2018-12-17 19:07:31 So essentially, stocks are worth a hell of a lot less than we thought, and in essence so is the USA

1075 2018-12-17 18:58:33 Really? Then why has govt enacted a stop on Wall Street when stocks drop by a certain amount? Why is government in control of interest rates? I disagree. We now have required medical insurance at triple the cost. Afraid to say...we are moving toward Socialism. 1/2
1076 2018-12-17 18:58:10 $MDB - Was my true favorite! One of the strongest growth stocks out there. Today it breaks down! Not a good sign.
1077 2018-12-17 18:58:03 S&P 500 made new low for year today. Messy politics regarding FED# decision on Wednesday. Trump#Administration does not want rate hike. I hope FED does not hike and clearly states recent economic issues warrant this decision. Do not buy stocks ahead of FED meeting.

1079 2018-12-17 18:57:52 The day after the referendum result I bought stocks in maize.

1086 2018-12-17 18:56:01 You think a yield curve inversion is a cause of- or a symptom of- economic stress? Debt markets drying up: junk bonds can't catch a bid. How much corp. debt is tied to stock buybacks? Stocks getting crushed, there could be forced selling by corporates to meet debt service. Agree?
1087 2018-12-17 18:55:57 as btc decouples from stocks and is moving inversely today with traditional markets. I am with you in theory but im staying flexible and monitoring the situation as it unfolds.
1088 2018-12-17 18:55:35 Stocks could be down 8% to 10% *on the month" by Wednesday ... I simply can't see how the Fed can raise rates against that backdrop.

Calling it now: No December Hike.

The stocks are up in the US due to buybacks. The 1% are far better off, the rest of America now has an increasing deficit just so they could give these rich pricks more wealth.
1101 2018-12-17 18:52:25 Health-care and technology stocks pushed #US equity indexes lower as #investors considered the impact of the Federal Reserve on growth in an economy already jittery over trade, political tensions and a possible government shutdown!

1103 2018-12-17 18:52:13 #stocks Where have all the bears gone?  Considering the behavior of key stock groups since January, it is well-nigh amazing that key sentiment indicators show not much more bearishness than "normal."

1115 2018-12-17 18:48:02 Most absurd tweet of the day! I am losing money when stocks drop! Plus consumer prices & inflation rising. Neither are good for me (or you). Trump needs to stop this trade war or we will all be in another recession. We tweet because we want him to STOP. Got it?
1116 2018-12-17 18:47:20 How is the crypto-stocks correlation narrative treating you today?

Bitcoin+10%
ETH +12%
Tech stocks -1.5%

You don't see this in positively correlated markets.
1117 2018-12-17 18:47:16 Twitter stocks are down 5% I bet you anything we'll blame that on Trump.
1118 2018-12-17 18:46:12 Are you kidding? Under Obama, we GOT OUT of the recession. Stocks rose from under 7,000 to almost 20,000. Unemployment from over 10% to 4.7%. Under Trump, the trend continued with unemployment to 3.7%. Now do math, which is bigger number 5.3% or 1%. What are you hoping for?
1119 2018-12-17 18:45:50 2 stocks is not a good format for a game as fast as SSBU. Not only that, but 2 stocks also limits your options and can be really frustrating when you lose a stock by accident, it already puts you in a position where you're ready to lose, while three stocks allows better comebacks

1151 2018-12-17 18:35:43 Today I’ve seen 15% gains on an $1800 crypto$ investment.. 

Cryptocurrencies are a volatile set of stocks, and people serve themselves best by waiting for prices to bottom/stabilize, buying, selling once you’ve gained 15-20%, and re-involving once prices inexorably dip again

1157 2018-12-17 18:33:38 crush has been record for 12 months in a row....so no.    It's a zero sum game.  That is creating an oversupply in those other origins since our import demand has waned.   And the overall global stocks for beans has been steadily climbing.

1169 2018-12-17 18:30:11 Can the Fed do anything to save stocks and should they anyways?

1174 2018-12-17 18:28:27 Ok 2 these 2 things will mark a sharp reversal of stocks.  1. #Fed will raise but also issue a dovish statement.  2. U.S China will cut a trade deal.  I think yr end rally in in the cards.  Position to buy  #NFLX #TSLA #AMZN #BABA and other strong tech names.

1177 2018-12-17 18:27:52 Trump economy.  Stocks On track for Worst December since 1980!  Check your 401k people and then thank your stupid GOP neighbors for electing TARIFF MAN!  Ruining economies where he can!!!  I wonder if dense red state voters have a 401k?  I’m guessing not.  They hate though!!
1178 2018-12-17 18:27:28 Blood in the streets. Canadian mid/junior energy stocks. Way to play this is 
1 - diversify over 10 or so names.
2 - buy 20% position in each, then only buy more every 10% step UP - 4 more lots at 20% allocation each then hold for a double or more.

Never seen it this bad.

This would need to include a new tax on income from stocks. 

Fair?

In real life, aforementioned corporations just buy back their stocks on wall street so they drive up stock prices making themselves rich

1189 2018-12-17 18:23:37 the problem with Pot stocks right now is they had a big run, people are selling into the new year for tax reasons, but 2019 IMO should be a big year...almost all states legalized, shops open, crops growing. The size of this is unrealized yet.. should be a big bounce year

1290 2018-12-17 17:51:04 @CorvetteFund he still a powerful man. When a filling comes that he added it moves stocks up. Whether that move will last is a TBD.
1291 2018-12-17 17:51:03 The person that sits in front of me trades stocks, the person behind me is  a developer. Such a confusing seating arrangement at work lol
1292 2018-12-17 17:51:01 It's not a good amount of stocks for a fast game like SSBU and even outside of gamespeed, 2 stocks just limits comeback possibilities and can be very frustrating to deal with. Mess up once and you're already ready to lose

1294 2018-12-17 17:50:41 Considering where the US dollar index is right now, gold is acting very well. When the USD rolls over at some point, I think there's excellent risk/reward here for gold and gold stocks to really take off on a big run. Doing well today.
1295 2018-12-17 17:50:03 #stocks Is gold starting to warm up? Too early to say, but if currencies are sinking, and if dollar follows..
1296 2018-12-17 17:49:53 I could have bought #DGAZ stocks for $45, but I can't because I need to update my CA License info for @allybank .... The stock is almost at $100 now. I saw it coming. I'm getting good at this figuring how the market will turn #business

1297 2018-12-17 17:49:00 The surge in economy is contributed to the lrg co. buying back their stocks with the tax breaks they were given, which in turn decreases fed revenue. Then the rest of the 99% struggles to survive by increasing their debt.
1298 2018-12-17 17:48:24 Stocks are doing better than I expected after last Friday's sell-off.. interesting #investing #StockMarketNews

1300 2018-12-17 17:48:09 Furthermore, the box for the top 10% is also getting bigger, and that box represents people who make about $160k or more. Hardly multi-millionaires, considering most of them put wealth into stocks and tend to live according to their means.
1301 2018-12-17 17:47:22 Gundlach: “Think we’re in bear market, stocks going lower.” 5 min later: “Let me show you my new equity fund’
1302 2018-12-17 17:46:46 Now the Bear Gundlach launches a mutual fund. So put $ into your new mutual fund when you think stocks are gonna go down! Genius!
1303 2018-12-17 17:46:24 Put her in the stocks! And I think I’ve mentioned before that we have a ducking stool, here in Canterbury..........!
1304 2018-12-17 17:46:22 Personally, stocks, ETF’s or even an online course. It is only 1000$ after all. 10k would be something else
1305 2018-12-17 17:45:21 Austrian econ rule #1 is the Fed artificially pumps liquidity into the market and distorts credit markets (creating booms and malinvestment). & once they tighten - everything deflates.

Thus since early Oct2018 global Central Banks began net-tightening. 

Stocks collapse since
1306 2018-12-17 17:44:15 @realDonaldTrump ‘health care stocks plunge’ ... Dow falling again today Crooked Donald, yet again you’ve managed to stuff up another industry, congratulations, by the time you’ve finished your term America will be like a third world country!
1307 2018-12-17 17:44:11 How did they make money on buybacks when they were buying back during all time highs in the stock market? They bought those stocks back for much more than they sold them for. And are now taking all of the risks if the economy tanks again. I would be more worried when they sell
1308 2018-12-17 17:43:50 Or I could be like you and every other American and continue to work to pay back the $2 trillion in tax cuts for the ultra rich who have yet to create new, high paying jobs. You know the ones whose CEOs got HUGE bonus and used the savings to buy back their own stocks.
1309 2018-12-17 17:43:49 I don't really think its your fault. you had a bad start in life and were taught by your parents to emulate their own bad behaviour. You know other people don't all have stocks and shares and bonds and investments don't you? #teachreesmogg

1313 2018-12-17 17:43:13 The genius of Jeff Gundlach's prediction:

1) Predict surge in rates. 
2) Predict collapse in stocks. 
3) Know both won't happen. 
4) Know media will only remember the one you were right about.

1315 2018-12-17 17:42:38 stocks keep dropping and the POS want to raise % rates ---while Phag Kenyan got ZERO%
1316 2018-12-17 17:42:16 Doesn’t that show confidence in the economy? I mean if they own all the stocks, won’t they take all the losses if things tank?
1317 2018-12-17 17:41:34 Short selling is not available when investing in stocks and ETFs on Trading 212. That option is at your disposal when trading CFD instruments only.
1318 2018-12-17 17:41:24 But they're all telling me to buy stocks and sell bitcoin? Surely they want me to make money, right?
1319 2018-12-17 17:41:01 Bet the Lanzarote jet ski man would like to put u in those stocks.
1320 2018-12-17 17:40:55 Probably because stocks are close to crashing? 2008 style or worse? You heard it here first.

1323 2018-12-17 17:39:11 GUNDLACH: I THINK THIS IS LONG-TERM BEAR MARKET FOR STOCKS
1324 2018-12-17 17:39:08 The numbers they show are not a direct representation of how much your stock would be worth. Your value would increase based on the companies market value rather than just price. Stocks often “split” which decreases what 1 stock maybe be worth but the company value stays the same

1329 2018-12-17 17:35:51 That's my dream, the ministers against no deal resign en masse. But I don't believe a word of it, they're not going to resign we'd have to drag them out in irons and straight into the stocks

There's no telling what the NRA gave McConnell for not letting a bill get presented.
1333 2018-12-17 17:33:11 So U.S. Corporations are on a record $1 TRILLION binge buying back stocks*, something designed to push UP the stock price 
and yet the market continues to FALL
in DECEMBER (usually a boom time) 

*fueled by the giant tax break that would supposedly help work workers/raise wages
1334 2018-12-17 17:33:10 As our stocks continue to fall and retirements continue to diminish.  And corporations keep laying off.  Who are you trying to fool???

1416 2018-12-17 17:09:51 I should probably buy stocks of VPN companies once Article 11 and 13 go live. Everyone's going to rush in and get a VPN, probably could made a fortune.

1425 2018-12-17 17:05:08 I found a guy online today that picked 2 stocks, 5 minutes and random stages (standard stages, not omega/battlefield), and he also kept spamming the same moves over and over without even thinking about what he was doing
1426 2018-12-17 17:04:50 He doesn’t get paid a wage. His stocks make money. Not his salary. He has no salary. You don’t understand investments based on your ignorant comments.
1427 2018-12-17 17:04:44 Stocks are trading in Mixed Territory this morning, as they continue to watch the Fed Rate Hikes/Slowing Global Economy/US & China Trade Relations.  MBS is up 8bps and Yields have slid down to 2.87%.  Watch for Today's Market Report for more details.

1429 2018-12-17 17:04:13 A lot of talk about "no recession on the horizon", so stay long. I agree, as the 8 worst US stock drawdowns have occured in tandem with a recession...but...stocks have gone down as much as 35% with no recession present. Reminder to be mentally prepared for anything in this game.

Yes the top 25% have a wealth of 54 trillion
But most of that is in stocks, investments, land, equipment, etc, very little is liquid.
If the gov tries to tax all of that like you seem to want, the owners will have to sell everything.

My Stocks are tanking!
Already checked, no tax breaks for me!
Now you’re shutting down the govt over a border wall that no one wants?
Where’s all that WINNING??? You cannot be tired of something that hasn’t yet happened!

1548 2018-12-17 16:19:41 Traders buying with both hands because the Fed will save them.  (I bought too full disclosure).  But if stocks rally into the meeting does the incentive for Powell to reverse course change?  Raccoons take advantage of these news void periods to make runs like this.  Always.

1580 2018-12-17 16:08:11 @dutweets when are you getting eSim stocks!?
1581 2018-12-17 16:07:44 I see a reason why high-flying technology stocks came down but I am flabbergasted why would telecom stocks would come down so much.  These are already trading at 1 or 2 X EBITDA (CBB and CNSL).  Amazing to see that there are not enough buyers on these stocks at all.
1582 2018-12-17 16:07:26 we have entered into stretch of tough market trading conditions. Stocks becoming non obvious. "Patterns" are not working w/hi frequency as before.

1584 2018-12-17 16:05:57 You really are clueless. Powell got nothing to do with this. Interest rates are still at historic lows. Stocks should never have went this high x 10yrs. It’s all fake printed money. Biggest bubble in history. Do you understand that?
1585 2018-12-17 16:05:55 No idea the exact stocks. Just was invested in varies funds.
1586 2018-12-17 16:05:53 Look at stocks today. Tanking. Tax cuts are unsustainable. You are paying for them with higher consumer prices due to inflation. Plus GOP wants to cut SS & Medicare. OPEC cutting production so gas prices will go up soon. Low unemployment may change too. Layoffs, plants closing.
1587 2018-12-17 16:05:36 Some interesting recent market observations:

1) Tech and FAANG generally falling *less* than the market on down days;
2) In particular, $AAPL and $FB showing some relative strength;
3) Selling in the bank #stocks may be exhausting itself? Just look at $BAC

1592 2018-12-17 16:04:30 Yes, I understood that. The global economy affects the US and vice versa — just look at how quickly stocks plummet around the world when bad news is announced. And world population affects the US in many ways especially with anchor babies.

1595 2018-12-17 16:03:50 On the flip side. Imagine shorting stocks or stocks with low volume and huge spreads. They don't allow this because you can manipulate market prices from a direct access accounts. That's why they limit the "tradeable" stocks.

1598 2018-12-17 16:03:22 And all of them still have poverty, homeless and some times large bits of unemployment.  So when you look at social insurance you have to honest about its limits and its drivers. And places with healthy stocks of benefits have healthy economies with a lot of capito to tax.

I'm thinking that this quarter, between $AAPL, bank stocks, and $BRK.B itself, is the moment WEB has been waiting for. There will be shock and CNBC specials about the amount he's deployed.

1621 2018-12-17 15:56:03 That's not required. If you're buying stocks showing positive price action and volume signature of accumulation then the chances of gap down against you are very rare.

And if u follow position sizing principles then you won't have to worry about occasional gap downs.

1626 2018-12-17 15:54:06 Just told @Fatima_bn that today'd dip in stocks is a buying opportunity as Fed is expected to turn dovish in its statement on Wednesday after it raises rates as expected.
1627 2018-12-17 15:54:06 Very sad that the market is complaining about 2% rates. What is strange here is that both Stocks and Bonds are going down at the same time.

1634 2018-12-17 15:52:40 it’s kind of like stock manipulation,they stress stock owners to sell their stocks during this to lower the price to the point where if someone buys it now they can end up making a nice profit(10-30%)when their numbers are proven wrong(because they’re supposed to be wrong).
1635 2018-12-17 15:52:07 The thing about stocks is you don't watch it by the second, that's bad. Watch it by the hour, or even day if you plan to invest. So if you're concerned verizon's stocks go green for 10 minutes, don't be. #tumblrpurge #logoff2018

1652 2018-12-17 15:45:11 Santa’s failure to deliver typically doesn’t bode well for stocks heading into the new year. The last six times the rally didn’t materialize were followed by three flat years in 1994, 2004 and 2015, two bear markets in 2000 and 2008 and a downturn that ended in February 2016.

1655 2018-12-17 15:43:46 Kidding. I am too poor to put. Option is more of gambling and relies more on luck. Wrong buy/put = I lose all. Stocks, I can just hold etc $fdx
1656 2018-12-17 15:43:33 I remember when President George W.Bush on 2009 left Oval Office the Dow Jones stock market were below 9000when Batak Obama left office stocks were above 23000 the great idiot Danny Trump came stocks went up to above 26000 but it was the efforts of Obama not this jerk now watch

1661 2018-12-17 15:41:49 A Santa Claus rally typically works like this: The first half of December is usually weaker as tax-loss selling dominates trading, as investors focus on selling stocks that have declined in value so the loss can be used in that tax year to offset gains on other securities. ..

1663 2018-12-17 15:40:29 Blow me. I hadn't noticed the correlation. But now you mention it, Odey made £200m (for his clients, of course).

1667 2018-12-17 15:39:22 Thanks, Mike. I did read that article and was pleased to see you note the positives. I don’t mean to be harsh but I’ve read you for a long time and it seems to me you tend to take a negative spin all the time. I know we have issues and I’m objective for a living managing stocks
1668 2018-12-17 15:39:13 @michaelsantoli  can  you suggest a show that discusses stock  info- details-i.e.  stocks drop after a "lock-up" period , the  importance of  institutional holdings as price support, I guess a teaching segment is what I am requesting.

1725 2018-12-17 15:17:31 3/ during times of rampant speculation. It works--I believe--because ultimately the rules of the "dismal science" will out. You would challenge this only if you thought that a "new era" had dawned where stocks that are priced to the moon without a long history of profitability
1726 2018-12-17 15:17:18 App idea: allow people to "invest" imaginary sums in real stocks, & then track balances/prices, to help folks learn about investing in the market.
1727 2018-12-17 15:16:55 ya, just funny, when his book is down, it is some conspiracy.  Jesus dude, stocks go up and down.  not down for many years, but the do go down.
1728 2018-12-17 15:16:48 Oliver can you explain to me why human capital increasing doesn't help the economy (which i assume would help the government stocks too)?
1729 2018-12-17 15:16:38 Well, let's lookup ahead on the road. 

Data is rear view and stocks are priced on discounted future cash flows. 

And right now the future looks rough.
1730 2018-12-17 15:16:25 Yeah, long term macro is simple. Problem is, nasy recession is looming. Many stocks priced-in for FY 2020 revenue/profit expansion. So, I would say near-term macro (i.e. 2-3 years) will actually be quite difficult for investors. Those who pick winners LT are golden.

1737 2018-12-17 15:14:23 They should have regulated the derivatives market in 2008, or at least made it illegal for banks to invest in it. I fear we'll soon regret this failure in a big way. #wallstreet #finance #market #economy #stocks #politics #uspoli #crash

1782 2018-12-17 15:03:47 Then why are stocks tanking? Your tarries are hurting the country

1787 2018-12-17 15:02:09 Cuando el precio de la soja cayó a la mitad, la arquitecta egipcia encaró por cinco minutos la “sintonía fina”, pero como no quería pagar el costo político se detuvo y comenzó a devorarse las reservas y a vaciar los stocks:
1788 2018-12-17 15:01:20 Unemployment is continuing a 5yr trend, states are committed to clean energy not trump policy, inflation is higher than wage increase, deficit will double before2020, stocks are correcting itself, and what has tariffs done to the CPI? Those are facts you said just not all of ‘em
1789 2018-12-17 15:01:11 I am not a promoter of stocks but it looks like a lot of people are getting a deal on healthcare. #HealthCare mandates are unconstitutional.  #NYSE #health #economy #nutrition #401k #MAGA #AmericaFirst

1791 2018-12-17 15:01:02 10:00am 919 stocks are down from the open vs 2,106 that are up from the open. DOW -213
1792 2018-12-17 15:00:16 Lots of interest and inquiry on US stock options as well as ETFs on how to buy PUTs & leverage ETFs or SHORT stocks to benefit fr the "bear market" ..

1794 2018-12-17 14:59:59 I am officially depressed, there is no hint of green left in my bio stocks.
1795 2018-12-17 14:59:56 Then why do we need an increase on interest rates. You’re showing again you don’t know what you’re talking about. How is that a victory lap? Deficit out of control, stocks are down. If you took a victory lap you’d collapse from a heart attack.

1803 2018-12-17 14:58:16 The unpatriotic Federal Reserve refusing to join the Pro-U.S. agenda. With economic signs showing the need for downward interest rates, they are acting like NO OTHER FED in U.S. history, keeping upward sentiment... See what happens next to stocks if they again raise rates.

1805 2018-12-17 14:57:58 The S&P is slowly breaking the support level from the correction back in February 2018. Not too good of a sign on a technical basis, and this could signal more red to come. #stockmarket #tradingstocks #strivesmart #stocks
1806 2018-12-17 14:57:53 The analog to 1994 remains the best one for stocks but the market is quickly approaching that line in the sand for it to reasonably hold. The Dec '94 bottom was attached to Orange County CA bankruptcy. Is there an event lurking out there now?

1808 2018-12-17 14:57:27 Who are you trying to convince that everything is OK with our economy? Stocks continue to fall. Many indications we are heading toward another downturn or even recession. Mostly due to YOUR tariff war.
1809 2018-12-17 14:57:18 Weed still a strong buy. Not the stocks, just weed.
1810 2018-12-17 14:57:18 On the other hand. They have held up quite well in comparison to broader market selloff lately. I would think these would be the first to be hit hardest. If overall markets bounce, pot stocks could bounce hard.

1841 2018-12-17 14:48:16 Any rally is a short on high beta stocks, IMHO. Macro is the underlying drag right now. Rates go lower also, which drag financials down with them. That being said, the counter rallies can be sharp and quick, best to stay out the way.

1913 2018-12-17 14:23:23 For which stocks is the Irish quota in Irish waters higher than the MSY? Your info is so jaundiced you should be ashamed to publish it.
1914 2018-12-17 14:22:26 Nonsensical.  UK and Ireland top list because the stocks in their waters are overfished by 3rd parties under the CFP.  Like blaming a farmer in Indonesia for global warming when he first uses a generator to provide light to his family, claiming his emissions have skyrocketed.

1928 2018-12-17 14:16:52 We should bar federal judges in Texas and other states from owning individual stocks or accepting gifts or payments that could potentially influence the outcome of their rulings.
1929 2018-12-17 14:16:15 Housing wasn’t too high; interest rates increased by 1% & dropped all markets incl entry level. Middle class tax cuts? Drugs are bad for you. Stocks are not up 40%! It’d be 28K+ from Dec 2016 if that were true.

1949 2018-12-17 14:06:57 How sad is too that a regular segment on broadcast news, along with things like sports and stocks, is just reviewing Trumps most recent tweets and commenting. Like a world we live in
1950 2018-12-17 14:06:32 #SP500 is down more than 5% for the month #Dow #DowJones #DJIA and #NASDAQ also all down more than 5% since start of December #stocks #StockMarket #markets #investing #investments #WallStreet #Finance #economics #economy
1951 2018-12-17 14:06:27 Housing has been on rise for 10 years and prices got too high, of course it will pull back. Middle class just got significant tax cuts, minimum wage isn't meant to live off of(entry level job), stocks are up 40% in the last 2 years,pull backs always happen and are healthy.
1952 2018-12-17 14:05:32 Genuine comment from me here. I’d love to know more about it. Also the fishing quotas are for the protection of fish stocks.

1954 2018-12-17 14:04:50 Actually just think markets are over-reacting as usual.  Even the professionals there don't seem to look at the fundamentals of the economy or of particular stocks but instead react daily to headlines.  Very undisciplined.
1955 2018-12-17 14:04:36 This market looks heavy: I’m not sure year-to-year asset managers have much incentive to start hoovering up stocks like heroes right now.
1956 2018-12-17 14:03:50 Interesting about $SBUX strategy is the double digit growth in consumption they see in China & Asia Pacific. Furthermore, despite BZ’s outlier record yr of 60M bag production, the tight global stocks/use ratio for #COFFEE didn’t budge, confirming strong global outlook.

1974 2018-12-17 13:55:59 Santa´s Rally failure doesn’t bode well for stocks heading into the new year. The last 6 times the rally didn’t materialize were followed by 3 flat years in 1994, 2004 and 2015, two bear markets in 2000 and 2007...via Stock Trader’s Almanac
1975 2018-12-17 13:55:55 Merits of diversified stocks over bonds in the long run is clear, avoiding both duration and reinvestment risk as bonds would mature. Also the risk that investment goals wouldn’t be met by bonds alone, however, always pays to allocate some money to bonds for downturns.

2016 2018-12-17 13:33:19 I'm not arguing against stocks going down. If I have a stock at 100 and I think it's worth less, I auction it, someone comes and offer 95. We agree and the price drops, that's ok. But someone who has nothing to do, borrows the stock and decides for me what the fair price is?

2031 2018-12-17 13:15:45 Exactly. This will all boil down to who stocks the @GOP campaign coffers who’s been taking that money. (Russia  via the @NRA) Look at how hard @LindseyGrahamSC changed his tune. Many of them might not even have known about the $ until @senatemajldr & @SpeakerRyan reminded them.
2032 2018-12-17 13:15:13 $ABX.TO, $FNV.TO, $AEM.TO, & $WPM all large cap precious metal stocks that have broken out and are holding so far.  See how it goes, but this seems like this is what happened back in late 2015/early 2016.  Big cap stocks leading commodity? We'll know soon enough.
2033 2018-12-17 13:14:34 Bro there was like 4 minutes left. I wasn’t tryna play that shit, but stocks 1 and 2 were fine so I was tryna wait the lag out smh
2034 2018-12-17 13:14:18 I hate to sound like a broken record but there will be tremendous opportunities when this correction is over. Stocks that will explode to the upside. You just have to be disciplined, show some patience, and wait for the wind of the market to be at your back.

2037 2018-12-17 13:13:39 Is there a point to that? I can tell you I failed to become wealthy because I did not have the stomach for holding stocks.  That's not happening this time.
2038 2018-12-17 13:13:17 Indian equities ended higher today, extending gains for the fifth straight session, tracking positive cues from Asian peers.  On the sectoral front, metal and oil and gas stocks outperformed the benchmark index, rising as much as 2.0% and 1.3% respectively.
2039 2018-12-17 13:13:16 I've decided that most things that happen to the economy are people saying it will. Everyone says, "oh no everyone is about to sell their stocks and prices will drop." And people freak out and sell their stocks and prices drop.

2042 2018-12-17 13:12:42 @business #DaybreakAmericas : Tell #LizYoung that as far as investing in US Stocks are concerned, I say it's a safe bet because The Fed monetary policy normalization is not working and markets will rebound. Treasury yields IMO must break at least 350bp to sustain a correction!!
2043 2018-12-17 13:12:41 Gun control is not the same as gun abolishment. But, crazy GOP frenzied people don't want you to realize that. Nor does the over-powered NRA. Most gun owners aren't interested in war type extended magazines, nor bump stocks like they'd like you to think.

2046 2018-12-17 13:11:54 The tax cut allowed businesses to purchase their own stocks and raise output to shareholders. It made millionaires more wealthy and lower-income folks able to go to McDonalds once a week. Good health care WOULD be nice. Let's set priorities that make sense.

2053 2018-12-17 13:08:19 Kinda sucks when a bunch of stocks propped up by government handouts crumble leaving only those businesses that were economically viable around. 

The headline should be: Major bubble burst avoided as overvalued companies deflate after government backing evaporates.

Stay strong out there.
2067 2018-12-17 13:00:56 I retired at 50 not because of Trump. And you portfolio is in part Trump but mostly Obama. Look it up. Stop thinking Trump did anything. Stocks this year zero gain. If you have any real world experience. You know things are starting to go south.
2068 2018-12-17 13:00:27 Bonds not getting much out this new push lower in stocks. Just hanging out at or near the highs. Might be a signal that near term stock weakness could retrace early today. FDAX pressing lower, Bund dropping. NQ new low for the early NY time, ZN turned 15 bid but nothing more.
2069 2018-12-17 13:00:01 Political turmoil in Westminster tipped UK-exposed stocks into a bear market last week as investors rushed to grab protection from Government debt default amid mounting no-deal Brexit worries.

One thing you're right about is the team of people behind it all, especially the doctors. They obviously know how to do it.
The TUE's and stocks of triamcinolone and erroneous delivery of testosterone are clues.

2096 2018-12-17 12:44:05 Bund is acting odd in the face of FDAX losses in the last hour or so. ZN might be held back by that for the immediate period. If US stocks go lower with some force, that pressure from the Bund might give a buying opp early today.

2117 2018-12-17 12:26:34 Stocks are balanced on a knife edge. Will they break higher or lower? Currencies, bonds, and commodities have all weakened rather dramatically in the last few months, which bespeaks a lack of liquidity. Lower equity prices would be consistent with that.

2172 2018-12-17 11:33:36 When Obama pushed the healthcare bill years ago I heard that a lot of dems bought stocks in medical companies so that they could make some money when the bill passed. Hope I'm wrong about that. Sure wouldn't be very ethical for the dems if I was right. Would it?
2173 2018-12-17 11:32:12 All you talk about on twitt  is the Mueller hoax, no collusion etc. what about your voters who may not buy stocks during yourtrade war but have 491k’s that are down and out wherever they live. Now a shutdown for a wall. What about their S.S. Checks, unemployment checks etc.
2174 2018-12-17 11:31:41 Never said it was, I was just implying that estimations are quite useless. We don't even know what kind of weather it's going to be next week, or how the stocks will look in a year, I'd be careful predicting something 40 years ahead lmao

2195 2018-12-17 11:16:38 Just bc tumblrs new adult content policy doesnt affect u doesnt mean its fine, they wanna limit the speach on their site and its gonna affect artists, models, cosplayers, etc So, tumblr, rethink your policy, your stocks are already low.
2196 2018-12-17 11:15:03 Trump threatened to shut down the U.S. government next week in a discussion with Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi yesterday. What does it mean for stocks if this happens? The good news is the S &P has gained during each of the previous five shutdowns going back 23 years.
2197 2018-12-17 11:13:12 It means our stocks and indices which were still holding a good standing international have lost it so companies won't even be able to get credit etc from outside as s&p is a rating agency aswell. In short we're f*cked so bad

2201 2018-12-17 11:09:24 Sure, but accountability is paramount too. What if info presented as truth is outright wrong? I’m no legal expert, but would you reach a line where it becomes defamation? Wasn’t long ago that a false “news” statement was made(ABC), causing stocks to nosedive. Who pays for losses?

2207 2018-12-17 11:05:39 I’d say it was more a commodity rather then a currency. Kind of like stocks of a company. They can go up, down, there’s a limited amount, and can be redeemed for cash.

2508 2018-12-17 05:19:07 Mhm. Which will hurt their bottom line ( and stocks ) - it is a good thing in so far as they should be punished and allowed to burn for such an idiotic decision as to alienate a massive portion of their user base so callously.

2510 2018-12-17 05:14:16 I have, so far, never seen an "insider" correctly picking the moment for investment in any stock. I always hold that stocks reflect strength of its operator rather than its intrinsic strength on fundamentals
2511 2018-12-17 05:13:53 Ok I stand corrected. I'm not worried about brown babies or their parents. I'm worried about white men who have been taught to hate anything and anybody different from them and who have easy access to semi auto rifles, bump stocks & 30 shot clips.

THE FANG STOCKS HAVE BEEN SO INCONSISTENT... EUROPE IS GOING TO TAKE A TUMBLE... TAX WRITE OFF MAJOR COMPANIES HITTING A NEW LOW... BANKS ARE QUESTIONABLE.... TONE ANTONE
2513 2018-12-17 05:12:48 It is exactly what happens in Europe. Left stocks tensions within any society.
2514 2018-12-17 05:11:00 Luke, penny stocks or similar assets never go to zero, especially if they are traded on unregulated exchanges where price manipulation is common. #bitcoin will never go to full zero, instead the price will be so volatile no one will touch it.

2520 2018-12-17 05:06:10 'Traditional conservative values' suggests god botherers in frock coats, top hats and crinoline skirts who believed putting people in stocks in public is appropriate punishment and who also lack forward thinking. Oh,  that's #Hobart.
2521 2018-12-17 05:06:06 They were never going to. It was a corporate decision by the moron bigwigs @verizon and @oath - as self destructive as it is, they THINK it is a good idea. Their stocks say otherwise.
2522 2018-12-17 05:05:50 Certain people have to suffer in order to learn! Remember those Nigeria scams? Many victims never even admitted to their family. Same applies to Trumpeters. And watch stocks market tumbled in past month, it hurts their wallet deep and some have become angry, quietly. Tariff-man!

2536 2018-12-17 04:50:38 Yes, and crypto market cap is a dwarf compared to stocks, so no worries about that.
Just keep in mind that after this IV and V, we basically are gonna see a recession worst than 1929, maybe for decades. If you get rich, buy useful things.
2537 2018-12-17 04:49:25 There will be inflows over time. But what was needed in the US was entities that would provide the same structure as to what stocks and bonds have. If you don’t need that then you don’t have to use it.

2573 2018-12-17 04:15:31 Why can’t the Fed increase rates by .10 or .125...? Stocks used to be traded in fractions. Why not int. rates? It’d be less stressful and not as tumultuous.

2745 2018-12-17 01:31:09 401ks has always been a scam to enrich those who handle the stocks. It sure doesn't help the poor put food on the table does it #msnbc
2746 2018-12-17 01:30:09 @adam_ballinger
2747 2018-12-17 01:29:22 Yep we have junk bond yields up almost 50% this year, comods getting smoked. Either this really is the start of a long bear market in stocks or one of the crazier fakeouts in stock market history
2748 2018-12-17 01:26:51 Sure, there are examples of non-recovered stocks: northern cod (but not most cod stocks), some sardines/anchovy/herring
The entire west coast groundfish of the US is mixed, was severely curtailed with loss of fishing, now almost all are recovered and catches going back up
2749 2018-12-17 01:26:32 Did you buy Epic stocks, you fucking snitch?
2750 2018-12-17 01:26:28 Narrowing my universe of stocks I’m watching to: ATTU, AYX, BILI, CIEN, CYBR, DATA, DXCM, EVTC, FNSR, GKOS, NTEC, PLAB, PRQR, QNST, TSLA, TWTR, UBNT, UXIN, VCEL. If market turns up next tml in there
2751 2018-12-17 01:26:27 Does anyone trade stocks and shares? If so do they use apps? #investment
2752 2018-12-17 01:26:20 Poor performance of all stocks bought 5 years back did not check. Missed many cycles of stock performance in it 
2753 2018-12-17 01:25:45 Invest some of it in stocks and bonds , the rest will be used as start up capital for my cocktail business
2754 2018-12-17 01:25:25 Good, No tax burden on you .. stay in cash ..
invest when "Global Recession" comes back and stocks hit rock-bottom
2755 2018-12-17 01:23:04 Ok Isis has not been defeated. Obviously you haven't not been in the middle east lately. And that has nothing to do with blacks. Tax cuts I haven't seen a difference. My family and friends worked before this administration and still have jobs. I recently lost money in stocks...
2756 2018-12-17 01:23:02 Basically means get completely out of stocks for a long time.
2757 2018-12-17 01:22:57  You can play whatever Smash game you want 
 You can play whatever character you want 
 You can use whatever move you want 
 BUT 
 if your dumb ass picks 2 stocks and 5 minutes on QP in Ultimate you're not allowed to play video games
2758 2018-12-17 01:22:25 Hask Express Blow Dry Spray and this spray I use for ingrown hair  going online now to try find somewhere that stocks them
2759 2018-12-17 01:20:14 because of bump-stocks? because those are not made for AR-15s alone.
2760 2018-12-17 01:15:07 Due to its low risk profile, the return is generally less than other investments such as stocks, bonds, or mutual funds.Less stress and more probability of losing due to the changes of business owners and market changes.Organization changes. New technology, medical care, so forth
2761 2018-12-17 01:12:58 Stocks plunged as Tyson Foods, Inc. unveiled a caustic bottle of sunscreen today.
2762 2018-12-17 01:12:05 Shut up I just fought against a Snake who used down B more than any other option and he picked 2 stocks 5 min as the ruleset
2763 2018-12-17 01:07:31 He’s being sarcastic in case you can’t figure it out and sell all your stocks tomorrow.
2764 2018-12-17 01:07:11 It’s my first year being a cashier and all I gotta say is fuck you. What makes it okay for you to cuss me out for prices, out of stocks(mind you, it’s the holidays, and people are buying 27 of one thing) and treat me like I’m a robot?
2765 2018-12-17 01:07:01 if you pick stocks you’d be warren buffett 
2766 2018-12-17 01:06:16 He really made the rich richer. He did it with an interest rate of zero and pouring massive amounts of federal $ into the economy. They had to do it to prop up a weak economy. Stocks holders loved it.
2767 2018-12-17 01:02:57 I feel real confident being 85% in the market, but my stocks will only go up because the tide won’t take them down. Haha
2768 2018-12-17 01:01:02 merci quand même. Je pense qu'il faut que je trouve un magasin qui l'a dans ces stocks car indispo à la commande visiblement.
2769 2018-12-17 01:00:27 I just don’t understand why people don’t get how much product is made from oil and gas stocks.  Get some education people.
2770 2018-12-17 00:59:18 I high portion of stock gains are related to inflation but you aren't actually making money during cycles when the value of your investment drops
Its smarter protect your investment at it value at the market high and then reinvest in stocks when it bottoms out
2771 2018-12-17 00:59:11 It was a cold winter so everyone assumes oranges will be rare and more $$$. D.A & E.M. KNOW the winter has had no effect on the crops. So they sell their stocks at a high price and once everyone finds out OJ is in plentiful supply the guys buy them back and corner the market
2772 2018-12-17 00:58:50 switch it to 2 stocks hooooly shit
2773 2018-12-17 00:58:44 Sino bang member hahahaha parang medyo paubos na stocks nya saka pina sabay ko lang sa friend ko na umorder hahaha
2774 2018-12-17 00:58:20 Chase crappy stocks loose money been there
2775 2018-12-17 00:57:45 it is, and i keep losing stocks to it, whether it be buffered DI, airdodges, techs or get ups. Im tired of constantly dieing to shotty inputs
2776 2018-12-17 00:57:25 Well..Lets not go that far, people do value their assets way to much. If your asset doesn’t show value to make the majors then why hold on to them? Trade them when the stocks are high to plug in the holes at the major league level. Doesn’t work all the time, but give it a shot.
2777 2018-12-17 00:56:57 Word of Wisdom : Most people get interested in stocks when everyone else is. The time to get interested is when no one else is. You can’t buy what is popular and do well. - Warren Buffett
2778 2018-12-17 00:55:29 fell asleep. woke with a dream NBC, ABC, and CBS implicated in sex scandals. Their news networks vilified and shuttered. Corp stocks tank. Doom for NBC Universal, CBS, and ABC. Soros suicide? #2019 #predictions #premonitions #noFACTS

A source of iron!
2780 2018-12-17 00:53:07 If ya need stocks to go up, BATS declare self help. If ya need futures to go up, CME just has connectivity issues. Simple.
2781 2018-12-17 00:51:54 sure do! We have a Spider-Verse Promotional Cup available while stocks last! :)
2782 2018-12-17 00:51:13 Its a lost cause not just due to climate change or pollution but the earths human infestation stripping its food sources. It will not stop till we have depleted wild salmon stocks and other marine sealife  to extinction. All life in the worlds ocean is under threat of the humans
2783 2018-12-17 00:50:27 Stocks >>>
2784 2018-12-17 00:45:30 stocks had two 10% corrections in 12 months and most stocks are down 20% recently. The bear already came and needs to go hibernate. Trade war results and Fed are going to determine next move, not sentiment indicators.
2785 2018-12-17 00:44:09 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo
2786 2018-12-17 00:42:21 People who set their online preference to 1 or 2 stocks are the true crayon eaters
2787 2018-12-17 00:40:00 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
2788 2018-12-17 00:39:38 The Bushes and their cronies own stocks in pharmaceutical companies that were involved in MKULTRA which involved children. Today's vaccines kill and disable more children than three decades ago.

The Bushes were architects of the fusion centres too.

2790 2018-12-17 00:38:40 I could give two fucks about Hillary or Trump. This is about a group taking my membership fees claiming to defend my rights but then simultaneously call for more gun control and banning of bump stocks.
2791 2018-12-17 00:38:22 Whenever I read the word “stocks”, anything else following that makes no sense
2792 2018-12-17 00:36:33 @latelateshow Merry Christmas James... Love your show. Would you please give a shout out to the DONFRONSHOW on YouTube! Great guy helping people to learn how to trade stocks all for FREE
2793 2018-12-17 00:36:10 Excuse me while I buy stocks.
2794 2018-12-17 00:35:20 Now imagine when trump is found quilty, of charges and is paraded around the country in stocks, 

On a flat bed truck

Sun or rain
2795 2018-12-17 00:33:00 I might get kicked off Facebook. But who cares. I don’t. Their stocks have tanked. Too much censorship. Let’s hope Twitter isn’t that way. I like Twitter.
2796 2018-12-17 00:32:31 I can just ask my mom if you could have some of ours! She works for a warehouse for all of those things so she stocks up our house just in case we have parties!
2797 2018-12-17 00:30:20 Follow money.  Trump U was a fraud. His casino stocks maneuvers were legal but unethical, in The least. He stiffs contractors, stiffs wives.  When he marries does he take vows. If yes, then he's a liar. He lied about Daniels and MacDougal. lied about foreign affairs meetings.
2798 2018-12-17 00:29:35 After a rate hike on Wednesday, this yield curve will invert soon, causing stocks to crash in Q1 of 2019. Cryptos will follow. Bakkt is likely waiting for this to play out and for the Fed to change monetary policy before they launch and allow fresh money to push us up.
2799 2018-12-17 00:29:06 The stocks that were loved at higher prices were just put on sale. Cold comfort, since you've already bought and paid for them....
2800 2018-12-17 00:28:47 Stocks already with the suppliers. We will push through if we gather enough people. Please let us help you

2802 2018-12-17 00:26:58 I think it’s more of a comment on how well all the healtcare companies stocks have done since the ACA. Normally, a thriving  economic sector is good but in this case it is a lightening rod

2804 2018-12-17 00:26:02 Adam blocked me for this tweet. You can’t bash a company and then refuse to comment on seemingly positive full phase 2 data and expect to be considered a serious stock columnist. Especially when you turn around after bashing stocks like Amarin once they pop like you never bashed.
2805 2018-12-17 00:23:04 That time also left me ill prepared for a bear market like we are experiencing now.  Even to this day I feel I'm a one trick pony just trading WEED expecting it to keep climbing...it doesn't have too.  These stocks could go either way so diversity helps mask the risk.
2806 2018-12-17 00:22:57 If true, healthcare stocks are on sale right now.
2807 2018-12-17 00:22:04 Think I will. FB will probably take it down. Kinda like their stocks are now...
2808 2018-12-17 00:20:04 Can't agree more.  I am not invested in any stocks falling under this category. Don't need returns from these stocks / sectors. As simple as that ..!!
2809 2018-12-17 00:19:16 Senator Claire Mccaskill's husband raked in 131 million from federal grant money for his businesses. All while she was a US Senator. But yeah, stocks...
2810 2018-12-17 00:18:42 The faux Medieval Bud Lite ads that put non-beer drinkers in the “wine cellar” dungeon, the torture chamber “tour” and the stocks are endorsements of arbitrary violence & oppression. Budweiser must cease them immediately and apologize for their blatantly offensive nature.
2811 2018-12-17 00:16:18 Dumping money in stocks right now would be dumb, maybe the money market
The stock market will likely fall by 60-70% of its high by the end of 2019

2813 2018-12-17 00:15:11 If somebody could tell me whether trading stocks while between songs for a benefit concert makes me cool I would appreciate that
2814 2018-12-17 00:15:07 Mcdonald’s stocks are going to drop now that Taylor and I are not in Poland anymore. DUMP YOUR SHARES
2815 2018-12-17 00:13:53 Damm , In my panic to order *popcorn* for next weeks panto performances, I forgot to check my "bullshit repellent" stockpile, its dangerously low hope, stocks won't run out.
2816 2018-12-17 00:11:39 That would depend on who's given what instructions to their brokers now, wouldn't it?

Because let's be honest here, the Leave leaders almost certainly all have shorted stocks for the inevitable crash
2817 2018-12-17 00:09:25 And how do i call stock predictors in stocks? Analysts 
2818 2018-12-17 00:08:05 Or pick better stocks and define their time frame.

Plenty of stocks performing well $etsy $twlo $okta
2819 2018-12-17 00:07:55 I can’t remember the name but it’s one from kiko!! I always get a few kiko mascaras when I’m in a city that stocks it cos they’re so nice!!
2820 2018-12-17 00:06:51 Avacado stocks going down after two weeks of Bad Brady
2821 2018-12-17 00:05:52 If you're making "prediction", I assume you're hell of biased. How do you call price predictors in stocks? Guru?
2822 2018-12-17 00:05:28 I wasn't intending to anyway as I expect to have died either by the plague , lack of antibiotics or malnutrition due to the swarms of locusts and rats which would have devoured all our food stocks.
2823 2018-12-17 00:04:24 This is a finger in the dike move. It will fail when cash mkt opens & individual stocks sell.
2824 2018-12-17 00:03:26 Keep up the good work President Trump, the American people are behind you 100%!  Lower taxes, higher GDP, Stocks are going higher and higher!  Still need the Wall, better immigration, and get rid of Obama care (Highest cost ever).
2825 2018-12-17 00:03:18 How is @SmartContracter  biased if he trades the chart? You know what trading means @btcWhaleclub and how it's done or did you "learn" that this year? I honestly am amazed the negativity in this space. No such behaviour in stocks.
2826 2018-12-17 00:03:15 3 stocks allows for actual comebacks, in 4 if you're down a stock you essentially lose if you can't take their first stock before 40%
2827 2018-12-17 00:03:00 If buying stocks and like options, and spending money on legalized gambling is also included in the lottery option, then the answer is a resounding yes. Basic lottery tickets isn't a significant trade-off for "rich" people. It's like buying penny stocks.
2828 2018-12-17 00:02:16 Keep up the good work President Trump, the American people are behind you 100%!  Lower taxes, higher GDP, Stocks are going higher and higher!  Still need the Wall, better immigration, and get rid of Obama care (Highest cost ever).
2829 2018-12-17 00:01:53 I was laughing at home when you were taking stocks with nikita. Its great.
2830 2018-12-17 00:01:05 This Cycle is so much worse than previous Cycles. 

In the past, it was clear which aspects of the System were most egregious: whether S&L loans, DotCom stocks or Subprime CDOs, the obscenity was obvious. 

This Cycle is much more pernicious.
