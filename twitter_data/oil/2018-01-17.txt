17 2018-01-17 23:57:30 yeah they do, it takes quite long though but castor oil helps and you can get it from superdrug for quite cheap. my sister recommended it to me when mine kept falling out from individuals and it helps speed up the process:)

38 2018-01-17 23:57:12 Robbie's been working on that pipeline thing. He has to get that done or those big oil companies won't be giving him any more money. And you know our Senator Robbie he won't do a damn thing if he's not going to get paid.
39 2018-01-17 23:57:10 Who's my president? I haven't seen MY president yet. My president doesn't bang hoes in the oil office or porn stars while his wife is pregnant my president doesn't pull a fucking Benghazi or increase drone strikes and quietly kill more civilians than "anti Christ" bush.

45 2018-01-17 23:55:46 Yal, cooking with butter has been my go to. Butter is amazing, leaned away from oil. Oils has only been for protein for me
46 2018-01-17 23:55:36 a clean room, some fresh sheets, a hot shower, coconut oil, and some scented candles
47 2018-01-17 23:55:29 Converting a bottle of dry oil hair treatment to a misting bottle for paints has been one of the smartest things I have done today. One of the dumbest would have to be forgetting to get all the oil out of it before using.
48 2018-01-17 23:55:26 When he put the club up for sale he said he wanted rid of it by Christmas, I wondered why they didn't jump straight in. Now we are getting snippets of who the backers might have been and they aren't the oil rich Sheikhs we were led to believe.

53 2018-01-17 23:54:54 So no butter or olive oil for those  
54 2018-01-17 23:54:47 Awh damn that sucks, doesn’t realize surprise me though. But regular castor oil should do the job.
55 2018-01-17 23:54:21 Fuck all that, I’m going back to $5 lol IF any tip ;( sometimes I just have enough for the $80 oil change ya feel
56 2018-01-17 23:54:15 Once upon a time oil could only be sold for USD. That's not true anymore. So far that's all that's changed. Maybe that will have huge consequences for USD. Maybe not. Either way imma look into it
57 2018-01-17 23:54:12 This one time putting coconut oil in my hair caused a chick to pull out her titties for the entire group of people I was standing with. The lesson of the story being, always put coconut oil in your hair, if not for the health benefits...do it for the titties.

59 2018-01-17 23:53:52 Indeed, makes me think of a swimmer who has 3 oil tankers converging on him, all running at full speed  I suppose the goal is to not make any sudden movements so they know how to plan their trajectories , and you need to place a lot of trust in their eyesight

61 2018-01-17 23:53:43 I fully agree the practises are horrible but combustion car materials are not coming from great places either,you must remember that oil is one the reasons why some places are going through wars we see today,not saying EVs are better butwe must consider both sides of the argument

63 2018-01-17 23:53:28 To Continue.

The Price of Oil (POO):
= 69 $ / B
= 434 $ / m^3
= 434 x 10^9 $ / km^3
= 434 Billion Dollars per Cubic Kilometre Oil

And, The World Consumes:
5.75 Cubic Kilometres Oil per Year

Therefore,
The World Annual Oil Bill, is:
2.5 Trillion Dollars per Year

BIG ENOUGH

78 2018-01-17 23:51:11 Scholars of museums however should be careful not to render the oil sponsorship debate black and white. We should also be wary not to generalize the experience of curators--incl. Indigenous curators in communities deeply entrenched in extractive industry (e.g. Sudbury)
79 2018-01-17 23:50:45 Sometimes me wah bun him up wid cooking oil other times I want to sit and adore him idk
80 2018-01-17 23:50:43 Actually, YOU will cause many economic problems with your proposed policies. Who will be responsible for oil spill clean ups when they occur now that companies will no longer be held responsible?
81 2018-01-17 23:49:28 I hate coconut also. But tbh you don't really taste it once you start to swish it around. Just tastes like oil in your mouth. I say try it. If you don't like it, take coconut pills instead.

88 2018-01-17 23:48:40 We are evangelizing a Christian people who have lost the joy of their salvation. But the 7 torches of the oil of joy will consume all their bitter religion.

92 2018-01-17 23:48:00 There is NO guarantee whatsoever that Gold,Oil or USD will retain value. Bitcoin mining isn't "solving" anything. Understand how it works and maybe it will make more sense to you.

97 2018-01-17 23:47:04 Same!!underweight vegan don’t wanna just eat oil or shitty processed food, I know the right answer is coconuts/avocados/ just more calorie dense food in general but it’s so hard for me to have an appetite
98 2018-01-17 23:47:03 Not a product per se, but only washing my face at night and using apple cider vinegar diluted with water as a toner in the morning has drastically decreased my skin's oil production! (I still use spot treatment/moisturizer after doing both.)

1 Cubic Metre (m^3) = 6.2898 Barrels (B)

115 2018-01-17 23:44:11 MAYBE? Maybe, you don’t know! Maybe the reason is high paying, oil industry, jobs!  Maybe, it’s an incredibly small country with beautiful terrain and ocean ports and ocean views! Maybe, it’s the rich history, Maybe, it’s a return to heritage. NOTE: you have to pass their 2tests.

118 2018-01-17 23:43:48 .@ScottPruittOK You already favor Big Oil with corporate welfare. I know this as an investor. You are already disfavoring renewables. We could be energy independent by 12/2018 if you'd treat all energy the same.
119 2018-01-17 23:43:33 I’m sure you understand suppliers lobby to convince public there is no climate change, and lobby government not to impose carbon tax to offset environmental externalities of oil. Or maybe you don’t want to understand this of admit it?

139 2018-01-17 23:40:47 This weather got me so damn ashy, I had to buy baby oil lmfaoo.
140 2018-01-17 23:40:44 Back to shorting #oil
141 2018-01-17 23:40:34 yeah the highlight and the coconut oil were the ones I had really wanted to get.

145 2018-01-17 23:40:14 You don't need China. However, the Americans use the dollar dominance of oil, foreign exchange contracts & international payments for geopolitical control. That's why those who are controlled by US hegemony, are looking for alternatives to the petrodollar & SWIFT.
146 2018-01-17 23:40:11 知ってる？スーパーってタダで牛脂くれるんだよ。
147 2018-01-17 23:40:07 I’d be in a lot better shape if I didn’t treat my entire existence like a 6 year old who just went to the dentist.

Got my oil changed? Who deserves a  GD ice cream cone and a gold star?! Me. I do. 
148 2018-01-17 23:40:04 I am capitalism and the Arab Revolutions are dangerous because the region is now in a position to export both oil and revolution.
149 2018-01-17 23:39:57 The action is being taken against OIL companies and also note NYC is not closing down airports, freeways or cab companies in protest!
150 2018-01-17 23:39:30 Norway is one of the richest countries in the world, per capita because of their huge investment in oil and the revenue from that oil.  Pres Trump is making our country rich again.  So, more wealth and benefits will come to America if Dems just get out of the way.

154 2018-01-17 23:38:48 We talk about Norway, and the sovereign wealth fund they pay for with their national oil revenues.
155 2018-01-17 23:38:44 I guess the oil industry has a god given right to play with our climate and lead us into uncharted territory, but environmentalists are required to lay out a specific plan for returning to sanity? Burning 100 million years of accumulated carbon in 200 years has consequences.
156 2018-01-17 23:38:42 NYErs who don’t drive in SUVs are glad the city is suing big oil. The denial is decades long and will come at our expense
157 2018-01-17 23:38:41 Sounds like Mike Locksley who is already on staff. Meh hire imo. Snake oil Freeze may get a spot as well. He’s shady but his qb’s can usually sling it around.
158 2018-01-17 23:38:28 i bought an essential oil air freshener, placed it in my backpack, and forgot about it. it has apparently spilled all over my backpack, my pencil case, and my laptop now i smell like a grandma
159 2018-01-17 23:38:13 Listen, lemme tell you a little secret. 

I used to get bronchitis/walking pneumonia every winter. I would have to take antibiotics and steroids and an inhaler. Every. Single. Winter. for a DECADE.

NOT ANYMORE :)

Why? 

Oregano Oil.

Do some research on this amazing oil.…

161 2018-01-17 23:37:56 it’s been a week since we got back and I’m just getting round to unpacking my own suitcase after doing Callum’s straight away....and the tanning oil has leaked all over my suede shoes 
162 2018-01-17 23:37:52 That wild growth hair oil will have your head itching like shit, but it works so well .

165 2018-01-17 23:37:38 Don't forget the zinc additive for the oil if you are not using oil specifically for diesels
166 2018-01-17 23:37:29 Today’s mood: long haired man with glasses in the co-op who eyed me accusingly before scuffling off with his brand new essential oil diffuser
167 2018-01-17 23:37:22 my hair is getting so healthy since I’ve chopped it off and have been taking vitamins and oil treatments :)))
168 2018-01-17 23:36:53 I use their retinol and the squalane and think both are great.  I pat the oil on before my moisturizer, and have been using it on my lips too
169 2018-01-17 23:36:48 Then if anything grows while you pose
I'll oil you up and rub you down 
And that's just one small fraction of the main attraction
You need a friendly hand and I need action

180 2018-01-17 23:35:32 Why?  Why would you put yourself and family through this insanity unless it was for your loyalties. The oil industry.
181 2018-01-17 23:35:28 Honestly all the products I bought were great. The cream highlighter and coconut oil was worth the money. The beauty balm was great too but there’s like so many cheaper alternatives that does the same thing
182 2018-01-17 23:35:24 فكر ف الجنه تصغر الدنيا ف عنيك..
183 2018-01-17 23:35:03 يقول ابن مسعود"قسماً بالله ماظَنّ أحدٌ بالله ظنَّا إلا أعطاه الله مايظنّ وذلك لأنّ الفضل كله بيد الله" حَقّق أمنياتك . بحُسن الظنّ بربك
184 2018-01-17 23:34:57 Yes, David Dein was important to Wenger. I feel sorry for Wenger he helps the club through a difficult period 2005-2013 & comes out if it facing oil money & fair play in taters.  He deserves a chance to spend big but we're not doing that imo.

194 2018-01-17 23:33:44 You would have to be an uneducated idiot trying to get votes to think bio fuel from palm oil was a good thing.
195 2018-01-17 23:33:40 Exactly: and Louisiana is already far closer to the Venezuela model of oil economy.
196 2018-01-17 23:33:33 I’ve reached the I cant wait to add some peppermint oil to my diffuser when I get home stage of adulthood.
197 2018-01-17 23:33:32 Oil? What's oil got to do with being calm? Or did you just misspell "alcohol"?
198 2018-01-17 23:33:23 دائماً هناگ لحظات قصيرة تبقى في القلب ولاتُمسح من الذاگرة .. !
199 2018-01-17 23:33:04 I’ve been using a breathe/respiratory care essential oil in a diffuser and that’s actually been helping great! But unfortunately I can’t always have my essential oil diffuser on me lol

201 2018-01-17 23:32:37 @subaru_usa my dealer keeps telling me to call Subaru and Subaru keeps telling me that can't do anything about it - consumption tests come back negative but it's always low on oil sometimes 1.5 quarts low
202 2018-01-17 23:32:29 I'm so hungry and tired after work so when I got home I tried putting oil in the pan. Turns out it was pinesol. Is it fate.
203 2018-01-17 23:32:09 Which we the American people will foot the bill for. Do his supporters taste that snake oil yet or naw?

206 2018-01-17 23:31:21 Since its introduction in 1911, Crisco has revolutionized the way food is prepared and the way it tastes. From being the first shortening product made of plant based oils and oil seeds to creating the first cooking oil that was promoted for its light taste ...
207 2018-01-17 23:31:09 I need to go to walmart to get my cocount oil and  Vitamins.Guess I'll do it tomorrow then!!
208 2018-01-17 23:30:58 @bandholz hey man! Just got some tree ranger utility balm and old money oil. I received a sample of the temple smoke oil and instantly fell in love. When will the temple smoke utility balm be back on the site? I NEED some of that for sure. Thanks for the awesome products!

211 2018-01-17 23:30:43 Poor lad. Search the net for "Rick Simpson CBD oil" to give you another area to look into. Good luck.
212 2018-01-17 23:30:16 @subaru_usa so I just dropped off my Crosstrek for the 11th time because the oil light came on again - awesome
213 2018-01-17 23:30:11 Sometimes I think the whole country would be so different if Bush 2 hadn't stolen the election in 2000 ... we would all be driving electric cars and Putin's oil find in the Artic would mean zero ...
214 2018-01-17 23:30:07 Ah ok. I got confused bc Hugo Chavez &his oil hijinks/ selling the country to Exxon didn't seem a parallel.
215 2018-01-17 23:30:05 Did you know that 10% of the world's oceans are contaminated with oil from the cast of Jersey Shore's hair?
216 2018-01-17 23:30:03 This old lady is trying to challenge a mechanic on the efficiancy of her oil change. 

Talking about I wanted to see it before you replaced it  

Does she mean the oil or did she want to see the dipstick?
217 2018-01-17 23:29:57 Can you confirm the reason behind leaving green hill, chemical plant and oil ocean out of the OST?
218 2018-01-17 23:29:56 I bought chicken hot dogs at TJ's bc they were out of the beef franks, then I forgot to bring ketchup when I packed my lunch, so I topped them avacado, olive oil, and sea salt from our toast station at work, and I've suddenly become much more LA than I ever intended.
219 2018-01-17 23:29:50 Potato /corn etc., .. should have been deep fried but I do it this way to use less oil
220 2018-01-17 23:29:44 @plantbasedvibes spinach stuffed sweet potato. olive oil, salt and pepper your potato, sauté spinach with chili and orange juice. stuff and eat the whole thing. skin and all.
221 2018-01-17 23:29:43 I forgot how bad JP-8 stinks,not as bad as gear oil,but close.
222 2018-01-17 23:29:38 ça ne tiendrait pas à langue d'oc vs langue d'oïl alors ?
223 2018-01-17 23:29:34 まざい( 'ω')
224 2018-01-17 23:29:26 Nice reply from the tolerant left, this is how Norway pays for free education and social programs, revenue from North Sea oil.  You didn’t know this?  You sound very smart
225 2018-01-17 23:29:19 dr. morci was a great dude as president, but the gasoline company is beinf stiffle!! I wonderif the oil plant is moving faster about on the fake cruse market, did youk now anything about!
226 2018-01-17 23:29:11 Just caught myself in the automotive section simply to look at oil for the fun of it

I'm ancient I swear
227 2018-01-17 23:29:11 I wanna use oil pastels next

233 2018-01-17 23:28:15 #JerryBrown #DEMOCRAT gov of California expanded off shore drilling by 17% and added 238 new oil wells. I thought #trump was bad. Listen to @loudclearradio to learn more.

236 2018-01-17 23:27:54 Ngl I lost like all my lashes when I had my individuals! I could of cried my eyes looked so bald! I used caster oil on my lashes and within 2 weeks I had my natural lashes back!
237 2018-01-17 23:27:51 They have North Sea oil $ dude. That's the reason they can afford everything. That's why you said the same thing about dipshit Venezuela until oil tanked.
238 2018-01-17 23:27:44 Norway's the one with all the oil as well, bastards. I'd argue we're close to socialist but not quite there. The exact tag is not as important as the fact that the system really does seem to make everyone in it quite happy, contrasting the US somewhat. Can't be all bad then.
239 2018-01-17 23:27:35 Norway is also a Petroleum based welfare state . Without the revenues form the North Sea oil rigs , Norway would be a just a fishing village .
240 2018-01-17 23:27:12 Why would you want to fry air? Steaming it is healthier and there isn’t any oil slick on the floor when you’re done.

244 2018-01-17 23:26:31 Feel like Google Keep should be followed by Google Moat, Google Boiling Oil and Google Trebuchet
245 2018-01-17 23:26:24 In related news a McDonald’s second shift french fry dipper in Cadillac Michigan has announced his formal resignation from the assistant manager training internship over the company’s position on free- trade canola oil.
246 2018-01-17 23:26:04 The biggest shills are from the oil companies. They are the ones sponsoring bills  that are "skeptical" to client change. 
Which is bizzare because people claim the opposite, that the majority of scientists supporting the theory of climate change are the shills.
247 2018-01-17 23:25:57 How's that "all of the above energy strategy" and allowing oil exports working for us? Now, we have oil exports, so oil companies are ramping up production and thrashing the environment.

#ThanksObama
248 2018-01-17 23:25:51 And, just maybe, my kitchen floor after I knocked over a bottle of olive oil earlier. 
249 2018-01-17 23:25:47 Warm oil sounds so comforting.
250 2018-01-17 23:25:42 My favorite part of that is the oversized oil painting of James Brolin.
251 2018-01-17 23:25:32 Do you cook them because I know some countries cook them into a paste with the onions on top and olive oil Greek cuisine is the bees knees nick
252 2018-01-17 23:25:32 bruhhh coconut oil could probably cure cancer

262 2018-01-17 23:24:24 Far cry from when we were helpless victims of the middle east oil leaders.
263 2018-01-17 23:24:23 What about The Model for The Cause of Climate Change:

What about starting to do Your Maths,

264 2018-01-17 23:24:21 If you want to dwell on the past, it all started when they traded Ryan Smyth and the Oil dropped 19 of the last 20 games of the season. Never recovered

281 2018-01-17 23:21:18 no! Only benefits oil profits. America needs to expand on growing use of renewable energy for real independence.
282 2018-01-17 23:21:10 gas be high as hell when you can legit see the oil rigs off the coast.
283 2018-01-17 23:21:05 True! Trump installed a guy who has sued the EPA to run EPA, He chose an oil Exec.,another unqualified to run Educ. Dept. Judges who never tried a single case to lifetime positions..and on he goes.
284 2018-01-17 23:21:04 @ManCity deal is only worth £10m I suppose....did the Sheikhs run out of oil money?
285 2018-01-17 23:20:57 I think I said we should not replace our addiction to oil with other finite resources.
286 2018-01-17 23:20:52 Mitchell!  Gotta love a guy who keeps both a six-pack AND a bottle of baby oil on his bedside table.
287 2018-01-17 23:20:42 Use rosehip oil! It should lighten them and prevent them from stretching even more

289 2018-01-17 23:20:08 2nd wave: think Irina Dunn’s “a woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle.”  They focused on equal pay, strength, and independence. 3rd wave feminists, however, seem to need men to blame everything on since they refuse to accept responsibility for themselves. 
290 2018-01-17 23:20:07 I am wondering if I require a prescription to buy the CBT products. I also would like to know if the oil could be adapted to give my dog. Thanks
291 2018-01-17 23:20:03 SO-Called Evangelicals HAVE BEEN snake oil con artists for over 2000 years.  They prey upon the weak, the poor, and use misery to make MILLIONS for themselves, they ARE THE lowest scum on the planet...

306 2018-01-17 23:18:06 Yes! You don’t have to use them as often but when you give your face enough hydration and moisture it tends to stop producing so much of its own oil! It doesn’t feel the need to over compensate ya kno?
307 2018-01-17 23:17:55 My coworker gave me some Peppermint oil omg I'm breathing so much better 
308 2018-01-17 23:17:50 You are of course forgetting to boycott every brand of shampoo… and every other product in the same isle of the supermarket. That would be a No by the way.
Not using palm oil for biofuels is a nice break from the usual greenwashing the EU is so good at.
309 2018-01-17 23:17:40 .@VCFD_PIO said fire crews finished extinguishing 43 smoldering natural oil seeps in the Upper Ojai Valley during the weekend of Jan. 12. The crew at Station 20 in Upper Ojai is now charged with monitoring the situation. (1/2)
310 2018-01-17 23:17:40 I hear nothing makes Obama more proud in his retirement than looking up at the night sky and knowing he spent US tax dollars to preserve that one bright-ish yellow ball, which is full of oil.

313 2018-01-17 23:17:26 puhleeze.... you are either a bot or cult member.  Trump is raping America (as well as others) for his own gain. it is a so obvious. read about Russian oil deals on the deep web. it's worth billions.
314 2018-01-17 23:17:25 oil ain't nothing but ancient sunlight. have a think on that, nerds!

316 2018-01-17 23:16:59 KSA, ISRAEL,USA..Zionist blood brothers only after one thing..control of oil. It's old fashioned imperialism in the 21st century, except now we instantly know about it. Kinda makes one wonder about the atrocities carried out by British in unreported places..staggering

348 2018-01-17 23:11:11 Cuando agarraron el gobierno lo primero que hicieron fue matarnos a impuestos y subir la porqueria de gas oil que nos venden a  precios increíbles. Hipocresía a escala nunca vista.

352 2018-01-17 23:10:54 Meticulously moisturize my skin from head to toe. I use kukui oil and its like giving myself a massage.

354 2018-01-17 23:10:32 Means they don't have the votes, they only get on the lawn and have the penis measuring when they have finished screwing the people further. They need to oil and grease more people so they can vote against their constituents.

356 2018-01-17 23:10:26 Love the smell of peanut oil while cookin
357 2018-01-17 23:10:24 You either buy oil or you sell it. Everyone uses, whether you like it or not. So why not be self-sufficient and sell. Let's face it, getting oil from the middle east hasn't worked out that well for the rest of world. No control over pricing and numerous wars started over it.
358 2018-01-17 23:10:20 In 2015-16, Bend tied for fastest growth in the country with Lake Charles, Louisiana, a town experiencing an oil boom. A lot of GDP growth #inBend is tied to the housing market.

359 2018-01-17 23:10:18 I mean, I was mad yesterday because the guy at the tire store had Faux news on while I waited for an oil change, but this is a thousand times worse. I'm so sorry.

363 2018-01-17 23:09:13 How is highest tax increase in Albertans history, killing our oil now attacking our farmers, out of control spending out of control debt good for us, the PC under Redford had to go but the UPC is not taking our vote for granted, all NDP over tax and kill business vote them out!
364 2018-01-17 23:09:11  at least ours will have blood, palm oil
365 2018-01-17 23:08:39 That would not make an effective gun oil. Salt water is corrosive and has a very low viscosity.

375 2018-01-17 23:07:15 It’s a Superdrug one and it’s orange. I’ve only started using it recently and it’s been so good for breakouts but it’s drying my face out so bad so that’s why I’m mixing it with coconut oil which is working well so far
376 2018-01-17 23:07:13 Speaker Paul Ryan condemning Democrats for tying DACA to the spending bill in that they are "unrelated" topics.  Now isn't that interesting.  What did sneaking through drilling for oil in protected lands in Alaska have to do with a Budgetary Bill?  Nothing.  Weak. Sad.  Pathetic
377 2018-01-17 23:07:12 What do we do when our electric usage outweighs current output (Nuclear Hydro)? Or too many cloudy skies....Oil spills are cleanable over time.......Fukishima and other Radiation leaks last for millions of years ........How dumb r we?

387 2018-01-17 23:05:32 The US is like 2nd or 3rd in untapped reserves. The problem with mass producing oil is it could destabilize (further destabilize in Russia’s case) other economies causing more global tension. I always thought we didn’t do this because it was something to hold over Russia’s head

416 2018-01-17 23:03:14 You need to be using a coconut oil that’s extra virgin, raw, cold pressed and organic to reap the benefits, and all the natural goodness. I will say that coconut oil is overrated and it’s not a miracle oil but it’s good. I got my 750ml jar for £9.99 on Amazon. Smells good too.

418 2018-01-17 23:02:50 Putin wants a conflict, preferably in the middle east. This will spark fears in the oil markets and a fake supply shortage. That in turn gives his puppet cover to push for removing the sanctions on the oil deal. At that point Putin will be flowing a lot more oil at higher price

423 2018-01-17 23:02:29 @RepWalterJones the offshore drilling off the coast of NC is wrong. The history that lies beneath the ocean should not be spoiled by oil rigs.  This is the Graveyard of the Atlantic. We depend on tourism.  NC should be as exempt as FL

428 2018-01-17 23:01:44 Sounds shady and stinks of dead fish. Big Oil wants to drill in or pipe through Nat'l Parks. Dept of Int. Board gives 'yah' or 'nay'.

430 2018-01-17 23:01:14 We infowarriors miss you, Lee Ann. I thought of a song that has the word 'gravy' in it.  Iron Maiden's "Two Minutes to Midnight" when it is said, "As the reasons for the carnage cut their meat and lick the gravy,
We oil the jaws of the war machine and feed it with our babies."LOL

437 2018-01-17 23:00:32 Yep that’s fine, superb! However those regular kids who do go to uni do not have easy £ passage.  Make it even more financially tough - you push them into the arms of Corbyn the snake oil salesman.  At 18 they get to vote...Corbyn wants to make it 17...you’re helping him

449 2018-01-17 22:58:36 I’ve met many like this, seeking a quick fix and thinking another treatment program is the panacea. I think this indicative of a certain type of pattern of behaviour...it’s complicated and sad. Like those with terminal illnesses willing to believe that snake oil will cure them.

461 2018-01-17 22:57:42 Basically I think we aren't evolving superior solar distributed systems because it threatens to strand huge chunks of infrastructure and assets built in age of oil.
462 2018-01-17 22:57:32 I don't know, YouTube undercuts better than Standard Oil.
463 2018-01-17 22:57:12 Post a video of draining sump oil, then cut to someone drinking a cup of caramel or chocolate sauce, pretending it's oil.

Would people be dumb enough to take it seriously and copy it? Probably.

I wouldn't even feel bad. It'd just be cleaning the gene pool.

472 2018-01-17 22:55:08 Fossil fuel reliance is past. We continue to subsidize big oil w/massive tax cuts & corporate welfare. Clean energy is the future & created more new jobs than coal. At same time Trump rolls back environmental protection for coal country & they’re losing healthcare there.

498 2018-01-17 22:51:14 Right?  

Cory decided early on that it’s easier to get fewer large dollar donors (like Oil and Gas and the @NRA) than it is to represent constituents concerns for many small donations 

So his positions are: harvest the planet and who cares if your kids get shot?
499 2018-01-17 22:51:11 AGREE 100%. All thru the BP Oil Spill I was watching Louisiana locals' youtube reports & getting the REAL news about what happened. It was shocking & is STILL covered up.

501 2018-01-17 22:50:55 I think we hit peak UK in 1996. Scotland is better of on its todd and we can focus on making culture for a living - video games and movies. Stuff oil and gas.

523 2018-01-17 22:48:08 Yep, you’re right, Rob. non-nuke Iran poses zero threat to America. The U.S. has them surrounded on all sides with military bases. And those who say they’re a threat are simply power thirsty corporatists, looking to cash-in on military contracts and natural resources (oil).

528 2018-01-17 22:47:29 Selling “big oil” has more to do with supply and demand and profit than pious greenness. Might as well get some free virtue signaling as well.
529 2018-01-17 22:46:36 War for profits! That is the real meaning of all war, profit, money, military contracts, oil, resources, control.
530 2018-01-17 22:46:35 This ball has all the elements you look for. Got a feeling I’ll resort to this a lot on fresh oil shots with some friction
531 2018-01-17 22:46:32 It's. A. Joke. Y'all.
It's, like, her dog turned into a hipster. Y'know, one of those people who would turn all grave and warn people about things like essential oil diffusers around their pets.

535 2018-01-17 22:46:16 Depends largely how the alternatives are produced. From a carbon standpoint cutting down peat swamp rainforests in Borneo, draining the swamp, burning the peat, and planting palm oil trees is pretty hard to beat.

570 2018-01-17 22:38:56 The point is, there's a law requiring people to buy biodiesel, and they otherwise would not buy it.  Thus artificially increasing demand for soy oil and soybeans. That's not the case with industrial lubricants.

572 2018-01-17 22:38:30 Tag it what u like,but there's nothing far from the truth,go get a chair sit n think...

574 2018-01-17 22:38:16 Females don’t never check their oil , they just put gas in their car and drive 
575 2018-01-17 22:38:09 I have a lot of fat friends and none of them are trying to take away my healthcare and allow predatory colleges to exploit young people and create the conditions for dangerous oil spills and sell off our parklands and...
576 2018-01-17 22:38:05 I like to think the Chelsea team are all huddled together, with a mad-eyed Conte in the middle belting out the Filippo Berio olive oil tune.
577 2018-01-17 22:37:48 We are doomed unless we get off oil. We should all have 10kw Solar at home and drive Tesla's or at least covert to nat gas.
578 2018-01-17 22:37:42 Churchill said a country that does`nt stand up for itself deserves to be crushed,,he was wrong,but westminster still have that mindset.They will fight like dogs to keep scots resources,Yoons dont get if we gave oil up we`d be indy by friday

Now i know your Problem.
I won’t be a part of your Little Stupidity Charade.

586 2018-01-17 22:37:03 Is hash oil essential?
587 2018-01-17 22:37:01 Wasn’t Gene the ref who used the “F” word over the mic at Lucas Oil a few years ago? Or was that Tony Corrente?  Either way that was classic!
588 2018-01-17 22:37:01 #Zuckerberg sucks.
589 2018-01-17 22:36:57 Gabriel just put some "blessed oil" on his pointer finger, and said, "Come here mama and let me bless you!"

I looked at him and said, "You better bless yourself!"

I allowed him to bless me by putting a little cross on my forehead! 

He done laid hands on Michael and prayed! 
590 2018-01-17 22:36:52 Your car comes out of the carwash: tattooed, purple (no matter what color it was before the wash) wearing slutty make-up, dressed like a whore and obsessed with videotaping it's oil changes.

593 2018-01-17 22:36:13 I’m sure warm oil swallowing will be the next fad. Like butter coffee.
594 2018-01-17 22:36:03 You good bruh, just dap a little more coconut oil in it next time
595 2018-01-17 22:35:56 That's not a characterization of you, @Superman4Bernie, but of Clay and company peddling their snake oil and denying what actually happens in the real world.
596 2018-01-17 22:35:53 Lucas Oil stadium?  Lol
597 2018-01-17 22:35:53 Praying that this lemon tea and essential oil combination keeps fighting off this virus that Definitely Isn’t the flu.
598 2018-01-17 22:34:55 Making a less desireable activity more costly through adding a tax, is an exceptionally effective way to adjust human behaviour.  The CEO of an oil company will always say there are better options, but that is not true.
599 2018-01-17 22:34:52 I Just Need My Oil Changed 
600 2018-01-17 22:34:39 a la the 2015 energy reform that opened up de-nationalize Mexico's oil and gas industries.
601 2018-01-17 22:34:37 If i need your Opinion on how to do things, i’ll ask. But for now, keep them to yourself. Thank you.
602 2018-01-17 22:34:31 The oil from Morata's hair spilled to the ground, that was why he slipped. He didnt dive.
603 2018-01-17 22:34:07 i told my mom that i had trouble with the fish oil pills we've been taking

"ok, so first, take a gulp of water."
"ok"
"then, pick up the bottle"
"...mom"
"then, OPEN the bottle"
"omgob mom"
"PICK THE SHINIEST ONES (ALREADY LAUGHING)"
"OMGOB MOM"
"IS THIS HELPFUL"
604 2018-01-17 22:34:07 Oil changed, grocery shopped, good wednesday 
605 2018-01-17 22:34:04 Make your unbelievably shiny tresses? Hair oil!
606 2018-01-17 22:33:56 Cut you off. No more oil for the east coast.
607 2018-01-17 22:33:55 Magnesium, multi v high in b, fish oil, a ton of herbs (consult an herbalist), phytoestrogen.
608 2018-01-17 22:33:47 Canola oil doesn't equal Camilla Cabello 
609 2018-01-17 22:33:41 Palm oil to be phased out by 2021, and biofuel mandate to remain at 7% until 2030. It's an interesting move, and steps away from previous sentiments.
610 2018-01-17 22:33:35 Without oil what do you think it will do to the value of sterling ? Junk currency ?
611 2018-01-17 22:33:31 Or maybe because unlike most Clinton he’s not totally about enriching himself through the office of president unlike Bush he’s not in bed with the oil companies and unlike Obama he doesn’t hate America and actually has a set of balls:)-
612 2018-01-17 22:33:27 Agreed!  Using vertical space in a classroom is key! Heaters are perfect for this (as are oil changing pans from Walmart!).
613 2018-01-17 22:33:26 i think i just ate popcorn that was covered in coconut oil (rather than olive oil or some butter-flavored margarine substance)....... not sure i'm a fan
614 2018-01-17 22:33:05  it does sound repulsive. You swish coconut oil between your teeth I think. I don’t see how it would work but I’m willing to try it if it actually works! Thanks for the advice! I will try the baking soda and peroxide :)
615 2018-01-17 22:32:55 Things I learned watching King Kong Escapes: The UN has its own submarine fleet that looks for oil. Nobody tell Alex Jones.
616 2018-01-17 22:31:59 If not with her consent, so not cool,plus her hair out,n privacy breached.
617 2018-01-17 22:31:50 Oh boy! See oil  for Morata head.
618 2018-01-17 22:31:41 Bref, on a de la chance ! Le gas oil est moins cher en !! C'est pour notre bien la hausse des taxes sur le carburant . Vite sortons de ce merdier ! @UPR_Officiel celui qui est boycotté par @BFMTV c'est @UPR_Asselineau
619 2018-01-17 22:31:32 Do you put coconut oil on your face like you would with a moisturizer?
620 2018-01-17 22:31:22 Do they just drain all of the oil out?
621 2018-01-17 22:31:22 Soooo... I think CBD oil may be a godsend?
622 2018-01-17 22:31:08 About damn time. I remember doing an LCA on palm oil for biofuels from Borneo back in 2007 that showed its GHG impacts were up to ~7-12x worse than conventional diesel.
623 2018-01-17 22:30:57 Like what if they changed my oil and whoops, I don’t have my wallet.
624 2018-01-17 22:30:46 Stir together 2 cups bluefish with 1 pound dairy. Blend with Olive Oil. Boil. Serve on salad
625 2018-01-17 22:30:41 Just face wash and coconut oil before bed! 
626 2018-01-17 22:30:40 About 70% of olive oil being sold is not actually pure olive oil.
627 2018-01-17 22:30:33 I have oil
628 2018-01-17 22:30:32 I gotta get a oil change tomorrow .
629 2018-01-17 22:30:20 Wait, what? You are in the Carla oil business
630 2018-01-17 22:30:16 @Graham_LRR, @ihorner, @James_LRR and any other @loadingreadyrun beards, is there any scent that you prefer for your beard balm and oil. I'm planning on sending a package and just thought I'd ask
631 2018-01-17 22:29:57  LUBRICATION : the action of applying a substance such as oil or grease to an engine or component so as to minimize friction and allow smooth movement.

"instruments with moving parts may require lubrication"

the action of making a process run smoothly. 
632 2018-01-17 22:29:52 You would think that oil change places would have you pay first before them performing the work.
633 2018-01-17 22:29:45 I'm still convinced Tillerson was chosen and ordered by Putin. Trump is very hands off with him alone despite Tillersons open condescention and we are booming in oil stakes. YUK
634 2018-01-17 22:29:42 It’s weird bc in italy some items have different names like tea tree oil esma aqua de luna
635 2018-01-17 22:29:39 Awww im sorry to hear that poor Papi, wish I was there. Id give you a 90min soothing deep tissue back massage with warm oil.
636 2018-01-17 22:29:22 @3AW693 tony, you should've asked Kyrgios brother what brand of orange suntan oil he uses. #whatishispurpose
637 2018-01-17 22:29:12 Reserves up as a result of selling debt, not because fiscal deficit brought under control. But I agree that oil at $70 a barrel changes lots.
638 2018-01-17 22:29:03 why are using a cartoon pic of kellyanne conway to make some kind of statement? #confused
639 2018-01-17 22:28:44 @realDonaldTrump since they're all #shithole countries tell your greedy ass friends to stop taking gold, diamonds, oil, natural resources from those countries.... stop building hotels, etc on their land.. raping underage kids
640 2018-01-17 22:28:42 Discovering that my hair loves olive oil
641 2018-01-17 22:28:39 So my mate just poured alcohol instead of vegetable oil on fire. And this boy just spoilt my only chance of proper home made meal this night
642 2018-01-17 22:28:31 oil? who said some bout oil, bitch you cookin?
643 2018-01-17 22:28:10 I’ll just say that oil is useful, bullshit isn’t.
644 2018-01-17 22:28:00 nah, I’ve disliked anything with a HINT of coconut since I was wee… cheap chocolate chips, I KNEW that aroma of palm oil. Hawaiian tropic on the beach, I have to move upwind.
645 2018-01-17 22:27:52 Who going to take our penalty kicks?? #FACup #CFC
646 2018-01-17 22:27:46 I wish people would stop putting this snake oil salesman in my feed.
647 2018-01-17 22:27:45 Gotta do that oil change by duded
648 2018-01-17 22:27:41 Okay, so let's say the surplus oil goes into industrial lubricants. Couldn't you then say those lubricants would promote deforestation since they'd contribute to soybean value? Just seems like cutting out biodiesel wouldn't actually change the equation there.
649 2018-01-17 22:27:34 DYK that Los Angeles is an oil production area. LA's government had regulatory oversight and allowed oil production for decades  (a possible complicity issue).  Royalties to LA for production is another barrier to a lawsuit.

651 2018-01-17 22:27:01 I was most distressed when I heard that an oil man....Rex Tillerson...... was going to be Secretary of State...........
652 2018-01-17 22:26:50 WTF Pedro  key penalty red card minutes to go #Shambles #CFC
653 2018-01-17 22:26:43 New cars are all fun & games until it’s time for maintenance. Long gone are the days of free oil changes  $120 oil changes are not what’s up
654 2018-01-17 22:26:36 I'm sure Donald Trump would love it if the whole park service closed so he could drill for oil and blow some mountain tops off for coal the just sell off our national parks. He's doing this stuff right in front of us while distracting us with absurdities.
655 2018-01-17 22:26:08 @dominos every time we order a Roma pizza we never get the rocket or chilli oil. Why is this?
656 2018-01-17 22:25:56 Who will be your shout for penalty takers then Jake ? #CHENOR
657 2018-01-17 22:25:47 The dude wouldn't abide Salons bullshit
658 2018-01-17 22:25:45 You know dang well ..... if the Middle East did not have oil .......... nobody on this planet would give two flips about the ME or the people that live there.... Without oil..........elites would be like........eww.....
659 2018-01-17 22:25:32 اقول حاسب نفسك بس قبل لا تحاسب العالم !
ان شاء الله كلمة العمال تبين منو اللي حسم الصناديق تاريخ ٣٠/١
660 2018-01-17 22:25:25 When you bite into a hot, expertly folded cheese slice and a jet of warm oil shoots directly into your gaping coat sleeve
661 2018-01-17 22:25:20 Ok show off. Sorry I can't sell oil to buy players like you
662 2018-01-17 22:25:15 No sah somebody oil & powder Morata???
663 2018-01-17 22:25:09 Chuck Woolery - snake oil salesman.
664 2018-01-17 22:25:07 I gotta go get some more coconut oil for my face
665 2018-01-17 22:24:29 Smiting oil rich countries like a virile God!
666 2018-01-17 22:24:28 They  will underfund and deny affordable access and then when parks are broke, they will buy them up cheap and drill for oil, after cutting down all the trees and hunting all the animals!
667 2018-01-17 22:24:27 But you know we had similar growth in 2011 before the 2012 elections and those were purely because of oil but these one are a little different
668 2018-01-17 22:24:21 Not really. Kinda stressed for my final oil pastel piece for art as my teacher said it looked like it did it in two hours rather than two weeks. I don't want to give it in tomorrow. But i hope youre feeling awesome
669 2018-01-17 22:24:16 How about some stock tips. Are you riding the $vix, are you short or long on oil? Hahahah JK. You have no idea about anyone those things.
670 2018-01-17 22:24:16 I dey chop olive oil moi moi
671 2018-01-17 22:24:02 So why are you in oil’s pocket? That is NOT the future and we are not leading. Renewables.
672 2018-01-17 22:23:55 Industry insider could just have easily gone to Zinke who is doing all he can to help the coal, oil, and gas industries.
673 2018-01-17 22:23:48 I’m getting an oil change and I wanted to be like, “and I know there’s other shit wrong with my car don’t bring it up” 
674 2018-01-17 22:23:38 oh @jaltucher I wish your marketing geniuses would lay off the snake oil approach. I mean, video players without a scrubber? Weak sauce, sir. I believe in you but you’re hiding behind traditionally shady scam mktg tactics.
675 2018-01-17 22:23:33 This Cocoshea Honey Body Oil smells delicious yo
676 2018-01-17 22:23:31 Make sure before you apply the nailpolish your nails are clean and don’t have any oil/lotion on it. It creates a barrier.
677 2018-01-17 22:23:27 Sick asf and my internet is out, and we ran out of oil last night #greattimingpaisley #dying 
678 2018-01-17 22:23:23 Anyone want to come and hang out while I change the oil in my plane in Hayward, around 5?
679 2018-01-17 22:23:20 oh great...an oil magnate spewing war strategies...whatever could go wrong?
680 2018-01-17 22:23:11 it just took me 15 mins to put bio oil on all my stretch marks and scars
681 2018-01-17 22:23:11 @Vape_Auctions Evening all, I’m looking for a vape pen that works well for CBD oil and herbs. Any suggestions would be welcome!
682 2018-01-17 22:22:47 I bought an e.l.f. Brown Sugar lip exfoliator today and I'm super excited to use it! It has shea butter, Vitamin E and jojoba oil. Lord knows with this freeze warning my lips need more tlc!
683 2018-01-17 22:22:40 It’s simple, I wanna know if there’s any olive oil in this mayo or not
684 2018-01-17 22:22:36 This is going to penalties I fear ! #CHENOR
685 2018-01-17 22:22:28 just shaved my legs with coconut oil for the first time and let me tell u. magical experience.
686 2018-01-17 22:22:25 @atexanstravels It's easy, you just mix coconut oil with honey and cinnamon, toss it together w oats, and toast in the oven. Ever tried it?
687 2018-01-17 22:22:20 Speaking I'm sure for women throughout the country, I would rather be boiled in oil!  Ugh!
688 2018-01-17 22:22:03 I sympathize with the PUV drivers na affected ng oil price hike due to TRAIN law kaya sila nanghihingi ng fare increase.

PERO oh am gee itong UV drivers, gusto talaga doble ang itaas?? Mga jeep nga 2 to 4 pesos lang ang gusto. Ano kayo?????
689 2018-01-17 22:22:02 need a oil change :(
690 2018-01-17 22:21:51 I’m sorry I’m for any food item that comes with it’s own insta flavor pack just add water steakummm needs salt pepper oil water onion salad bread wine candlelight condoms bed a date etc etc 
691 2018-01-17 22:21:47 Sabes que luego probé con LemonGrass essential oil y me alivió mejor.
692 2018-01-17 22:21:44 those are the same dudes who pose at the pool with baby oil on
693 2018-01-17 22:21:37 That would make one heck of a renaissance oil painting!
694 2018-01-17 22:21:24 Oil ffc
695 2018-01-17 22:21:18 Kneipp do a herbal bath sampler collection.  My all-time favourite is Kneipp's Sweet Dreams valerian and hops bath foam (the oil version is nicer than the bath salts version).  It's not very foamy, which I've been told is because it doesn't contain detergent.
696 2018-01-17 22:21:14 I drive soooo muchhhh. I’ve put 21k miles on my car in 8 months. That’s 1.5x the average miles per month. I just took my car for it’s oil change and my guy was like “where the fuck have you been going?!”
697 2018-01-17 22:21:04 I am a responsible woman who once had a lovely family in the Uk. I am personal assistant and i worked for my late father company, he had an oil investment company based in the UK. I'm from London. what about you ?
698 2018-01-17 22:21:00 @GaryLineker glad to see VAR is fixing football 
699 2018-01-17 22:20:44 Endorsing snake oil products now eh?
700 2018-01-17 22:19:59 Shambles just like you predicted  #VAR #Joke
701 2018-01-17 22:19:54 I gotta start putting this coconut oil & cocoa butter to good use
702 2018-01-17 22:19:45 You and Pruitt are an embarrassment to Oklahoma. Blind loyalty to big oil companies is short sighted.
703 2018-01-17 22:19:43 Thank you. I mentioned Total (tot). French oil giant
704 2018-01-17 22:19:39 Too many dark skinned folk there for Trump's America to care about. What they really need is oil reserves and influential white bankers living there.
705 2018-01-17 22:19:32 We're there to protect Putin's oil interests.
706 2018-01-17 22:19:32 The self reliant libertarian in me likes the carbon tax as it helps us off world oil cartel dependency. When the Saudis blink we go into recession. #Ctax is funding diversification and consumer savings in energy use. Green infrastructure
707 2018-01-17 22:19:14 <みなさんにとっての"オイル"とは何ですか⁇
708 2018-01-17 22:19:11 شكلهم حمولتن طيبه ودونا عندهم وانسونا  @shlil4
709 2018-01-17 22:19:03 At the moment Big Oil is tearing our country's public services apart. The common denominator to all the PFI's are Transocean, Haliburton, PwC and KPMG. Directors and chairman are of or formerly of KPMG or PwC, who in turn are chosen as official receivers of said PFI. #corruption
710 2018-01-17 22:18:56 I hope my future boyfriend looks at my tweet and says his the water and oil that mixed
711 2018-01-17 22:18:50 Yay I’m getting my oil changed and it always makes me nervous so I put it off for too long but I did it and now I’m happy
712 2018-01-17 22:18:34 Games gone. VAR and dirty Arabian oil money everywhere
713 2018-01-17 22:18:30 祖母談だけど、それまで普通だった家族親戚でも、100万円の預貯金や50万円の香典しか無いのに骨肉の争いに発展してしまう家族もあるらしい( ・д・)固定資産だけじゃないのよぉ～有価証券、ビットコイン、ゴルフ会員権etc...まともなサラリーマン家庭なら保険くらいかけてるしね
714 2018-01-17 22:18:29 Elbow is super dry and I'm out of moisturizer so I just put olive oil on it
715 2018-01-17 22:18:22 Almost time for the Camaro’s first oil change
716 2018-01-17 22:18:18 MINI charges $138 for a fucking oil change I am deceased like I love y’all but FUCK THAT
717 2018-01-17 22:17:55 I've been adding Coconut Oil to ma Coffee Lately
718 2018-01-17 22:17:54 Ha ha ha ha idiots making up figures it goes up every time I go on twitter. Because he hasn't chose city he's choosing money. Coming from the club built on oil money. He may have just decided to sign for the bigger club. Your tweet is desperate
719 2018-01-17 22:17:45 WHERE TF IS MY COCONUT OIL?
720 2018-01-17 22:17:39 Not so bearish on oil but curious whats ur target
721 2018-01-17 22:17:30 I take Cod Liver oil because when I don’t take it, i see a noticeable decrease in the quality of the skin around my nails. I also take Zinc and Magnesium but fairly sure they do fuck all
722 2018-01-17 22:17:06 My sure cure for sinus crap: Boil water in large pot.  Once come to boil, remove & set on table w/ hot pad. Add 2-3 drops tea tree oil. Shove head over steam/fumes with towel over head. Breathe in thru nose.
723 2018-01-17 22:17:05 I do weekly oil treatments (sometimes twice a week) and that has helped my hair grow like crazy. Maybe that can make your wait a bit shorter 
724 2018-01-17 22:16:52 Well and the oil standard
725 2018-01-17 22:16:49 AIT says Washington is thanking Taiwan for imposing sanctions on a Taiwan national for alleged involvement in selling oil to North Korea.
726 2018-01-17 22:16:45 well i wanted a quick win but seems i was wrong. turning back to my equity indexes. thnks for explanations. any books you can recommend for someone who wants to get into oil fundamentals?

728 2018-01-17 22:16:33 Doctors didn't delve deep enough into his mental state, but that day may come..... Yet, from his past we should have learned that he has always been a liar, hustler, snake oil salesman! He won't change!
729 2018-01-17 22:16:19 Now my car is leaking oil 
730 2018-01-17 22:16:11 On Saturday, Bulldogs will play in the MFA Oil Shootout at Mizzou Arena vs #2 Mid Buchanan at 1:35. If you plan to attend, please buy your tix at one of the 4 Harrisburg locations (HS Office, C&S, Comm Trust, HTown). Tix are $8 each (under 3 free), good for all 6 games that day.
731 2018-01-17 22:16:10 Its all Sunshine  and till you realise all of this was as a result of increase in oil production because hey prices have beefed up and oh the mining sector too...and oh all of those are mainly run by outsiders not the government....
732 2018-01-17 22:16:06 Coconut oil + Aloe Vera gel combo 
733 2018-01-17 22:16:02 宝具レベル上がってくれないかなー

735 2018-01-17 22:15:34 Tonight at 7:00 pm @AssemblyNWT a Ledge Talk with Da Hubert. Countries rich in oil, gas and minerals often fail to secure a fair  share of their natural resource wealth including #NWT
736 2018-01-17 22:15:34 Indeed, next to the green beans was my attempt.

I do have tapioca flour prawns, oil, and a steamer
 I'll let you guess what tasty treats that "should" turn into in the future.
737 2018-01-17 22:15:33 Greggs ought to do fruit pasties.
738 2018-01-17 22:15:25 Picking the wrong priorities. Already oil drilling off fl coast off the list. Don’t u read the news?
739 2018-01-17 22:15:09 Senascipus oil glands, coal like us (colitis) .. gasp... gas a gain. Ad journey ... gotta run
740 2018-01-17 22:15:06 Ang tocino little oil lang coz baboy yun magmamantika pa sya on its own tas sabay yung taba sauce yun.kelangan mo iikot paulit ulit ng 3-5 mins each side pag may konting itim na pwede na yun
741 2018-01-17 22:15:05 Very kool! Old school! Brakes ? Haha!
742 2018-01-17 22:15:05 By the GRACE OF GOD I can also get my car insurance and oil changed this weekend by the strength I was given as a hustler! I don’t work for nobody but my clients!!!
743 2018-01-17 22:15:05 (Has no clue what that means- not old lady speak)  Who used up my Oil of Olay???
744 2018-01-17 22:14:55 Shades of the black oil from X Files.....
745 2018-01-17 22:14:51 Magnesium+calcium+zinc, ginko biloba, evening primrose oil, Chondroitin, vitamin d, ashwagandha, rholdiola rosea. 
It’s taken years of trial & error to get the balance right, but if I run out of any it’s noticeable. 
Hope this helps! 
746 2018-01-17 22:14:44 Sorry, went for an oil bath. Both RX and I are droids, I'm just better at hiding it.
747 2018-01-17 22:14:35 A pea-sized amount of baby oil can act as a shine hair serum before dashing out the door.
748 2018-01-17 22:14:28 If it’s olive oil, sure!
749 2018-01-17 22:14:26 so nobody wants to fill cushing to the point where we get another total crash?  thus we won't get it. so what is a good price for oil then? another issue is that high oil will limit world growth at some point. i fear 70 is already a bit hot.
750 2018-01-17 22:14:25 Coconut oil too. I’m a fellow panty and bra boycotter 
751 2018-01-17 22:13:32 Nice , but image chrome orange with white . Now that’s sick !
752 2018-01-17 22:13:32 Je pense que j'ai rarement autant joué de games de Tavern Brawl. Oil rogue, Freeze mage et Patron warrior c'étais vraiment trop bien.

756 2018-01-17 22:13:04 I hate when people post snaps of them driving & theor car dash says "oil change" or the oil change light on.
757 2018-01-17 22:12:39 There had better be a very good reason that the pesto is submerged in so much oil.
758 2018-01-17 22:12:31 Never heard of this but I know coconut oil is great for hair so def looking into this  thank you!!!
759 2018-01-17 22:12:20 fresh ginger + essential oil sprays to keep the air refreshed from germs + and high citrus diet helps too mama 
760 2018-01-17 22:11:51 Go to YouTube and key search reversing plaque..Dr sears...40 days of fish oil ..he claims wipes out the hidden plaque
761 2018-01-17 22:11:39 I need a beard oil to combat split ends
762 2018-01-17 22:11:32 And for him to pick more unqualified workers to run the national park to drill for oil and other resources
763 2018-01-17 22:11:23 Read more than one article until you really get the picture.  I'll bet most people have not thought of Shell Oil or GE as welfare queens
764 2018-01-17 22:11:21 Thanks.  Trump's lying when he says global warming is a Chinese plot.  Solar is cheaper than gas or oil now and there's no pollution.  A solar panel is good for 30 years.  Great for consumers and working people, bad for rich people who own oil and gas stocks.
765 2018-01-17 22:11:00 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
766 2018-01-17 22:10:56 One place to look is oil fields. How are they being managed now? What deals might be made? Also, there are small pockets of gov forces in SDF areas.
767 2018-01-17 22:10:35 When i tell you this fucking coconut oil and Shea butter is HITTTINGGG
768 2018-01-17 22:10:32 え…エルザとは…別に…な…(ﾀﾞｯ

770 2018-01-17 22:10:20 Trying tea tree oil for the first time ever.
771 2018-01-17 22:10:16 人に会うたびに膨らんだって言われるけど、明日氷河期が来たら生き残るのは僕だよ。
772 2018-01-17 22:10:13 i think it goes the other way: oil up significantly > inflation > real rate down > Tips & gold
773 2018-01-17 22:10:05 They want the money (& rich white people) from Orinda, Lafayette, San Ramon, Danville, along with the ship-to-shore-&-rail oil transfer & processing plants of Richmond & Martinez.
They’re not dumb.
774 2018-01-17 22:09:38 You don't want to run out of heating oil in Estonia this time of year.
775 2018-01-17 22:09:38 You do realise all these s shit your throwing about Sanchez is going to bite you on the arse in the summer when you oil barrens buy anyone??
776 2018-01-17 22:09:19 Ha check the nick of that prick to the bird should wait to he’s sleeping and pour boiling cooking oil over his balls if yer want to go out shagging daft be single simple boys a tosser 
777 2018-01-17 22:09:11 Your kitty doesn't get sick from the hair product? I get scared of that every time due to my olive oil lotion and braid spray.
778 2018-01-17 22:09:10 It was an oil leak or something
779 2018-01-17 22:09:07 I hate waiting for oil changes
780 2018-01-17 22:08:57 As I said earlier today, if Gold drops, Oil must drop too. China has a line in the sand at 20 barrels per oz of Gold imho.
781 2018-01-17 22:08:56 Deceleration began in early 2015 with annual growth peaking early in 2015 and sliding all through 2016. More than oil: housing slowed, consumption saw some choppiness, non-oil business investment softened. Recession risks rose.
782 2018-01-17 22:08:48 #Africa is the richest continent on earth home to everything from oil and gas to precious stones, valuable minerals and unparalleled naturescapes. The continent has 3 of the 5 fastest growing economies in the world. Take that-#ShitHoleLeadership @okayafrica #Immigrants #racism
783 2018-01-17 22:08:48 IF people stop going to parks, then they can justify selling/leasing the land to their oil friends
784 2018-01-17 22:08:30 KSA position is and always was @Zxcote to throw money into the problem 
Sometimes they win/gain(Egypt, Sudan), most of the time they loose( Qatar, Lebanon) 
Rarely draw( Yemen)
It’s an excellent strategy if oil is at 100+ $
Failing now, thus new Crown prince reforms
785 2018-01-17 22:08:25 Just made a spreadsheet for all of my essential oil purchases and I feel like @mscharissamoore would be so proud.
786 2018-01-17 22:08:14 Just telling everyone that if you can, get some bananas covered in coconut oil, roll them in some cinnamon sugar, and then grill them
787 2018-01-17 22:08:04 They will find some company that will say they are “keeping the savings” and that’s all we will hear for a week
788 2018-01-17 22:07:58 brought my car key with me so now my dad can't charge my battery or go get me an oil change while I'm not even in town and not busy 
789 2018-01-17 22:07:55 Everyone forgets our Secretary of State is an unqualified oil executive installed by Putin.
790 2018-01-17 22:07:47 OIL DIFF: 5.44 -> 5.49
791 2018-01-17 22:07:44 I got a body oil called "zen" and it did quite the opposite for me this morning
792 2018-01-17 22:07:33 Don't forget the baby oil
793 2018-01-17 22:07:26 Getting an oil change right quick..
794 2018-01-17 22:07:17 Someone set up an oil diffuser in my office
795 2018-01-17 22:07:14 Good: Voted for A.B Original, Midnight Oil and Paul Kelly for #ac100.

797 2018-01-17 22:06:59 SF NY and soon L.A. to join in lawsuit to sue oil companies over global warming. cookoo left wingers, hahahaha
798 2018-01-17 22:06:44 The lawsuit against big oil will help pay for the subway
799 2018-01-17 22:06:43 Why do you want to be dependent on foreign oil?
800 2018-01-17 22:06:42 I'm not saying we should directly control prices. I'm saying it is up to US how much we tax corps. Natural resources belong to US: oil corps use that oil at our leisure, we will tax them what we want and allow them what profit we want. (1/)
801 2018-01-17 22:06:40 When an oil change turns into you need this and that and end up spending $100 
802 2018-01-17 22:06:36 What if the citizens of these western counties so worried about Islam growth told its own governments and corps to pull out of the Middle East completely. (Let’s assume we unfucked our dependence on oil) do you think that would have any affect on the spread of Islam?
803 2018-01-17 22:06:35 this nigga just asked me why I be so oily , because I use coconut oil 
804 2018-01-17 22:06:33 Every Starbucks employee ever: “Would u like to try our new coffee beans freshly grown from the southern plain of Guatemala with elephant tusk dust and beads of jasmine aargan Moroccan oil?”

Me: ...

SB employee: “..it’s stronger”

Me: “o yea sound”
805 2018-01-17 22:06:32 when you’ve had a stressful day, is there any other way to deal with it than a hot oil hair treatment and watching Fievel, an American Tail?
806 2018-01-17 22:06:17 Ok so if you’re just real cool with all this - let’s start fracking in YOUR backyard - & YES - you can see the oil drills off the gulf coastline - doesn’t matter whether the drills are from USA - when they break the oil washes up in our shores - hurts our environment & wildlife
807 2018-01-17 22:06:09 I want to start using coconut oil on my skin but I’m nervous lbs
808 2018-01-17 22:05:56 I  don’t even know what this person is trying to say. 
809 2018-01-17 22:05:55 Miceller water or coconut oil
810 2018-01-17 22:05:44 VAR. What a fucking waste of money.  The biggest gimmick since kallakers.  Pure snake oil.
811 2018-01-17 22:05:40 Need to change the oil soon.... Or not
812 2018-01-17 22:05:39 They have taken a good look at Sturgeon and the oil price and thought no thanks!
813 2018-01-17 22:05:36 For over 5,000 years, frankincense has had many vital uses that go well beyond just being an anointing oil. It was used to support the immune system, fight infection and cures disease, even as a potential natural treatment for cancer.
814 2018-01-17 22:05:35 New ballot proposals seek to protect owners of Colorado oil and gas rights
815 2018-01-17 22:05:03 I apologized to the oil
816 2018-01-17 22:04:59 Confession: doesn’t bother me a bit.
817 2018-01-17 22:04:57 That  spoonfuls of oil twitter post, has spurred you on
818 2018-01-17 22:04:48 So the place where I work has a garlic sauce that comes with every pizza
The first ingredient is soybean oil.
Straight up
Soybean. Oil.
And I ate that shit yesterday. 
I ate an entire thing. 
Of 70% soybean oil.

And nothing happened. 
What the FUCK?!
819 2018-01-17 22:04:46 2pm feeding time baby. And I still have a half a bag of chips. That's  that shit that keeps the fire burning :)... I don't often have half bags  left, lets see how well the avocado oil crisp held up to the air
820 2018-01-17 22:04:26 Why, what new information will their be available for folk to make their minds up, currency, oil, growth, education or will there just be a picture of a bridge?

826 2018-01-17 22:03:48 Lbh bagus si mufe. Oil controlnya lbh oke drpd benefit. Big pore masalahnya kalau km kepanasan pori2 km membuka. Benefit jg kurang long last dipakai (pengalaman sendiri) kalau di outdoor

832 2018-01-17 22:02:53 you think 70 brent isn't enough for shale production to kick in and export but loads of tankers ? i'm no oil pro but i know at this level they can get funded. lots of PE/high yield money available to them if needed at this level
833 2018-01-17 22:02:43 At what cost?? Polluted shorelines, reduced National Parks, filthy air and streams, oil slicks killing marine life, dirty water. Do you truly believe this massive destruction of our country will be worth it?? I do not. You Republicans are driven by one thing....money.

It's just a desperate scam by the criminal regime to pocket  foreign currency

843 2018-01-17 22:01:23 Yeah I have acne mainly over my cheeks and it’s a combinations between dry and oily but I use some prescripted medication and I wash my face with tea tree oil facial wash and moisturise but I’ve tried everything and nothing clears it it just gets worse
844 2018-01-17 22:01:15 I put the tortilla down and made sure I got a lil oil on both sides then on half the tortilla I added cheese then the veggies then more cheese and folded the tortilla on itself. Let it brown then flipped it over and allowed the other side to brown and the I cut it up

I cut up and sautéed the veggies in olive oil and seasoned them then on a skillet I put some olive oil down

865 2018-01-17 21:59:38 The oil price is still too low based on historic trends. Huge draw during a week of builds. s overlooking fundamentals & betting v. history

867 2018-01-17 21:59:33 here's an idea! If you are so concerned about subsidies ... the oil and gas subsidies world wide DWARF the subsidies given to EV companies to the tune of 6 TRILLION ... and they are polluting our planet in the process, why aren't you whining about THAT?
868 2018-01-17 21:59:15 what do you currently use & what are your specific skin issues (acne, oil, dry skin, etc)?
869 2018-01-17 21:59:15 @raddestgirlever Hello! Do you remember your recipe for "DO!" roller oil (or as I like to think of it, Felix Felicis) - or is the recipe a secret?
870 2018-01-17 21:59:06 And while the rest of the world eats our lunch in alternative energy-an industry that is creating thousands of jobs-the idiot in the WH is promoting coal mining & oil drilling. But he’s like the smartest guy & the greatest bizman. Sure you are Donnie boy. Sure you are.

Other Ingredients like palm oil, maggi,salt, etc are at home.
That's what a pot of Medium soup costs.
872 2018-01-17 21:58:57 Earlier on, my earpiece soaked in a bowl of palm oil 
873 2018-01-17 21:58:46 I have to use a special cream.. but maybe I could see the oil you were using that could help because it’s so ugly.. :(
874 2018-01-17 21:58:37 Oh man, I hardly see oil paintings online. I just love the texture of it. ^_^ I really like the way you did the lighting and detail on the hair.
875 2018-01-17 21:58:35 Christopher Assad believes that Turkey's hand in Syria is not that strong. According to the political observer, Washington is highly  interested in its Kurdish allies on the ground since they could help the  US "carve out a strategic corridor for oil and gas pipelines."

877 2018-01-17 21:58:16 Nope, just Philadelphia's scenic oil refineries during mid-January
878 2018-01-17 21:58:08 The oil companies will be big donors to the L N P! They are owned by the corporations!
879 2018-01-17 21:57:58 But he does it in 2 and 2! Lol! Selling blue Emu rub. Hello snake oil to pay for the retirement home!
880 2018-01-17 21:57:58 what did the snake oil smell like? 
881 2018-01-17 21:57:57 Soaking in a hot bath, then showering off & moisturizing your entire body head to toe with coconut oil is so satisfying 
882 2018-01-17 21:57:51 VAR ???? @BBCMOTD #penalty
883 2018-01-17 21:57:37 Have supplied myself with rose water and sandalwood oil because I need the essence of Armand Gamache nearby.
884 2018-01-17 21:57:21 COME ON CHELSEA!!
885 2018-01-17 21:57:17 About 80% of the CO2 generation from a barrel of oil is when the final product is burned in an engine. So fuel efficiency should be of the utmost importance to green advocates. Flying to climate change conferences all over the world is not a good use of fuel. Neither are yachts.
886 2018-01-17 21:57:04 No, not at all. Biodiesel prices are much higher than petroleum-based diesel. The environmental/land clearing effect of biodiesel demand is more complicated, because oil is only one component of demand for soy. But it contributes its part.
887 2018-01-17 21:57:00 Irony: Higher Crude Oil prices (up 40% to $65 since mid-2017) makes:
1. existing fossilfuel investments more profitable (fewer stranded assets)
2. new Clean energy invstmts more attractive since lower oil prices were slowing their adoption
888 2018-01-17 21:56:54 It’s alright you know, got that oil regime on lock 
889 2018-01-17 21:56:42 Close could tell it was too late
Ohh baby candles and oil surrounding the bed
890 2018-01-17 21:56:36 Yes! They are. My favorite way to cook them is coconut oil and balsamic vinegar, with a little salt and pepper. Seriously one of the most under-appreciated vegetables 
891 2018-01-17 21:56:35 until like last week i used to think that my skin was so oily but like ,,, did i see the dry flakes on my face from trying to get rid of oil when i didn't have any ,,, what was i doing ,,,
892 2018-01-17 21:56:33 Coconut Oil is 
893 2018-01-17 21:56:31 Psalm 23: 5. You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. 6. Surely your goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
894 2018-01-17 21:56:18 Wonder what it is in cold oil?
895 2018-01-17 21:56:17 Try argan oil. Moriya akane love it
896 2018-01-17 21:56:17 So for you personally, do you come to the point where you have to re-evaluate your life before or after you decided to rub your hair on the bathroom floor to catch escaping drops of coconut oil?
897 2018-01-17 21:56:10 Wise words we often forget
898 2018-01-17 21:56:05 I am not gentle, nor am I a man. 
But I'd strongly recommend soap or whatever with tea tree oil in it. Rocky Mtn Soap has a Minty Tea Tree bar and its real good.
899 2018-01-17 21:55:47 All I’m seeing is xenophobe.
900 2018-01-17 21:55:42 "Data is neither oil nor steal. You want to use an analogy use steel, because data is what you build an enterprise with" - @BillRMcDermott #IP2018 @adexchanger
901 2018-01-17 21:55:17 I get super motion sick. Even if I’m in the car for an hour. I use sea bands, Bonine or Dramamine, and peppermint essential oil
902 2018-01-17 21:55:01 I need coconut oil and aloe
903 2018-01-17 21:54:54 I need to order some more of these hairbrushes from Japan with tsubaki (camelia) oil in them. They make detangling long hair so much easier, Daiso makes them (I think they are like a 100 Yen / Japanese dollar store).
904 2018-01-17 21:54:45 Fish oil pills, biotin pills, iron pills ; or coconut oil treatments at home !

906 2018-01-17 21:54:29 Hi. Solar panel and mirrors use the sunbeam to heat oil is different. @NeedforSpeed
907 2018-01-17 21:54:20 though cocoa butter can make your face break out /: but u can get cocoa butter for your lips and ponds is good for face at least overnight because it’s super moisturizing and hypoallergenic so it shouldn’t irritate if u have sensitive skin & tea tree oil for any really dry spots!
908 2018-01-17 21:54:01 You only need look at Ligue 1's recent attacking exports to the Premier league for your answer
909 2018-01-17 21:53:56 And do what with the oil? You need money to develop it, people to work to extract it and then a customer to deliver it to. kurds have none of that.
910 2018-01-17 21:53:53 Update: put CBD oil on my aching tooth. It works
911 2018-01-17 21:53:41 If a restaurant puts olive oil on the table, it's almost always a good olive oil and almost always a good restaurant
912 2018-01-17 21:53:27 Wire hair.
Add some Dax, Palmer's coconut oil, or Pink!
913 2018-01-17 21:53:24 I bet Delia Smith's chair looks like someone just dumped a bucket of olive oil all over it

917 2018-01-17 21:53:09 Well done Jake 
918 2018-01-17 21:52:58 I also use a lightweight facial oil if I'm really dry. I use Josie Maran argan oil light.
919 2018-01-17 21:52:57 There's oil on your head!
920 2018-01-17 21:52:45 Who needs National Parks? We have enough nature videos to allow a lifetime of watching from the comfort of our couches! We don’t need unspoiled nature and wilderness lands for future generations to see. There is beauty in open pit mines, deforestation and oil sheens on the water
921 2018-01-17 21:52:41 subir el dólar a $36, implica en la práctica subir la carne y otros productos básicos más de 30%, bajar el gas oil a $26 que las naftas lo subsidien subiendo a más de $60... En definitiva, que ganen mucho más los frigoríficos, los exportadores, los estancieros y lo pague el resto
922 2018-01-17 21:52:12 Well, since 2011 we've felt earthquakes in south central Kansas, but that's because of oil fracking in Oklahoma. Could be that.
923 2018-01-17 21:52:01 Something something whale oil, wires, something?
924 2018-01-17 21:52:00 @SecretaryZinke: Our children deserve better than their health and safety being sold out to oil and gas lobbyists- the #cutmethane methane rule protects kids, but instead Zinke turned back the clock on progress.
925 2018-01-17 21:51:30 I want an oil diffuser. I love the smell of jasmine and eucalyptus
926 2018-01-17 21:51:28 Time to oil dong meh hair again 
927 2018-01-17 21:51:27 Even my peanut butter has palm oil in it. I am disappoint. Sorry @DrBirute
928 2018-01-17 21:51:25 Not even close to true. Time will prove you wrong and the voters will remember. Big oil and gas will get richer thanks to trump and GOP and the public will see no savings.
929 2018-01-17 21:51:25 Talking about oil-
Mechanic: I had to drop it... 
other mechanic: why’d you have to drop it?
Boss: because it was hot... (starts singing snoop doggs part) 
I died

933 2018-01-17 21:51:16 Coconut oil is essential
934 2018-01-17 21:51:03 Those tanks and jets use lots of petroleum.  Follow the oil.
935 2018-01-17 21:51:02 If you ask a surgeon, you know the answer. I would start with the least invasive procedure. Please check out hemp seed oil.

939 2018-01-17 21:50:07 at the same house.  Matt Damon is SICK.  He and Ben Affleck and Jen Garner were going house to house sometimes with Jewish Brad Pitt, securing deals of secrecy with all the neighboring Jews and Damon was torturing my kids and boiling their faces in oil to try to force them to say

945 2018-01-17 21:49:20 I started doing the stuff my dad's family did to survive. I forage for food and eat less or no processed foods. I travel with others .. and use as little oil as possible..
946 2018-01-17 21:49:15 WHAT AN ARTWORK - I LOVE OIL PAINTINGS
947 2018-01-17 21:49:11 But future will not look like the past. #Water scarcity could prompt actual war, but even more likely new wars like #cyberwarfare may change the definition itself. Are min # of battle deaths or declarations of war required? And what about proxy wars over oil or food?
948 2018-01-17 21:49:08 If we sold tomatoes with salt and oil in a Mason jar...would you buy them?

955 2018-01-17 21:47:23 In soviet russia people were manipulated to think they're living in communism; But in reality it was authoratian socialism they're living in and under. We are manipulated to think we're living in democracy; but in reality it's a Money, oil based Totalitarian regime.

959 2018-01-17 21:46:54 I need a oil change and all these places closed 
960 2018-01-17 21:46:30 A great deal of the inflation crisis in VZ is actually a foreign debt crisis; that debt crisis results from the reliance on food imports, suddenly cut off when oil prices changed; those imports exist because the country can't feed its own population at current agri output.

965 2018-01-17 21:45:54 Bath oil beads used to be everywhere ten years ago, now they're not.
Sure I could just pour oil into my bath but it's just not the same. And I need something to help with dry skin.
966 2018-01-17 21:45:53 Absolutely right we have plenty of wind and Sun here to make us the leading energy producer. Oh wait I got my money from the oil companies. Drill baby drill
967 2018-01-17 21:45:50 Bombardier no relationship to C02 there either,  pipelines a non-starter , we would rather burn down our towns with rail cars filled with oil.
968 2018-01-17 21:45:50 The national touristic fraud, applied on a bigger scale, would admit another celestial orb reference.
A simple travel to the Antarctic continent, presented as a powerful rocket trip. A journey designed to only expend more oil.
969 2018-01-17 21:45:44 Lard butter or oil should help get you unstuck
970 2018-01-17 21:45:42 Worked out tho cos I got a cheaper oil change cos high mileage cost more to change. Praying it won't mess my car up 
971 2018-01-17 21:45:24 Zero sympathy for anyone who voted for this hot mess.  They should have paid attention and made an educated vote, instead of voting for a snake oil salesmen.
972 2018-01-17 21:45:16 I told my grandma I'd get get CBD oil for her anxiety and she lost her shit 
973 2018-01-17 21:45:13 Essential oils are extracted directly from the bark, flower, fruit, leaf, seed or root of a plant or tree, just one drop can have powerful health benefits.Created through the process of distillation, which separates the oil and water-based compounds of a plant by steaming.

983 2018-01-17 21:44:15 we can spend however we like. we're spending decades of hard-earned money that's been generated through our global fan-base and club success. we don't have a billionaire Arab sugar-daddy giving us oil money.

989 2018-01-17 21:43:53 @RyanZinke Your utter destruction of the environment and sellout to the oil/gas companies makes me absolutely ASHAMED to be former Navy.  You should NEVER acknowledge your service for the shame you bring to those of us who served with honor. #AmericanDisgrace

999 2018-01-17 21:42:38 I got excited today because I finally got my wiper blades changed, got a new headlight, tires rotated, tire alignment and oil change. Serious #Adulting here! Haha. The only part that hurt was the cost 
1000 2018-01-17 21:42:37 I’m so sorry  
Right - I know this is easy to say but: you’ve got this - you’ve handled so much worse. You know your subject and either the pressure you may find some gems you didn’t have before. Get the kettle on and burn that oil babe. Once more - you’ve got this!! X
1001 2018-01-17 21:42:29 i ordered this new hair oil and i'm so excited to get it in the mail, it gives me butterflies

1003 2018-01-17 21:42:15 Will the social equality/economic nightmare - that is now America - ever correct itself. I'm counting on the kids -- if they don't all get killed in someone's stupid, "for money/oil war."
1004 2018-01-17 21:42:12 Good work Jack, may the oil of ease never dry up for you.

1147 2018-01-17 21:24:21 the guys at Auto Zone gave me a stool to make it “easier” to put oil in my truck & when I look behind me, they’re all staring through the window. smooth.

1151 2018-01-17 21:23:26 Which seems more likely? Bill de Blasio sincerely cares about climate change and does all he thinks he can politically get away with given the politics of the city. Or, Bill de Blasio really doesn't care about climate change at all; he just hates oil companies?

1276 2018-01-17 21:10:00 The US needs to lead in renewable energy, not oil
1277 2018-01-17 21:09:36 The statistics your referring to are skewed. Government spending and government jobs equal bloated deficit.  Private sector jobs oil, gas, forestry and agriculture increase wealth.  Simple and it works. Take investment away it dissolves.
1278 2018-01-17 21:09:03 Oil? What oil? It's an oil crisis man. It feels so bad realizing that the Turkana County government will only get 5% of the output while the Oil is in their native land and they been starving to death with their livestock for decades. It'd be at least 30%
1279 2018-01-17 21:09:00 I think it's outrage fatigue - nothing happens, no one is held to account - if this was happening in a country with oil the US would be lining up to invade to restore democracy.
1280 2018-01-17 21:08:58 Real estate is a piece of land plus any artificial improvement that are attached or have been added.

1285 2018-01-17 21:08:40 Politically cornered, but the US is the primary influence in the region due to horizontal drilling technology. Now that oil is around $70/bbl watch what happens. Gives enough breathing room for new Li-Ion battery improvement.
1286 2018-01-17 21:08:40 Coconut oil got my curls rightttt
1287 2018-01-17 21:08:35 i made a batch of rose water w vitamin e, bio oil and clinique toner and i just put a lil on my arm and its so fucking soft it feels like i just put body butter on my skin
1288 2018-01-17 21:08:24 Clove oil's good too. I've not thought abt oil pulling w/ a dash of clove oil. Might be the magic bullet. Feel better :)

1292 2018-01-17 21:08:07 For the record, if you’re reading this, do not go and trade oil. The industry is replete with smoke and mirrors.
1293 2018-01-17 21:07:51 Yesss organic turmeric ! Make it into a mask w a lil honey or olive oil (wear a shirt you don’t care about then put it on for 30 mins. Wash it off and use a face wash to get any remaining turmeric off ya face)
1294 2018-01-17 21:07:46 Thanks!  They’re SO easy!  Just trim your oyster mushrooms to lie relatively flat, toss them in a little olive oil and salt, then bake at 400 for about 20-30 minutes.
1295 2018-01-17 21:07:44 Exactly why the English sided with them when Iraq threatened to sell Oil Thru the Euro rather than the Dollar .

1301 2018-01-17 21:06:52 Pro tip for all you strimmahs interested in good eats:  When looking to toast a hero or roll, add olive oil with salt and pepper

1321 2018-01-17 21:04:15 Deceleration began in late 2015, partly because of falling oil prices; growth that year was 2.9 pct.

1323 2018-01-17 21:03:48 @seungminkim Oh sure. And for all you suckers that believe that, I have some Cure-All Snake oil I would like to sell you.
1324 2018-01-17 21:03:30 Just like all of you and your paymasters who brought Nigeria to the precipice will face the judgement of the Almighty God for looting the resources that should have been applied to stabilise the nation in the lean times of reduced income from crude oil.
1325 2018-01-17 21:03:21 HFI, what are your thoughts on the increasing decline rate - now at one oil sands mine/mo. in the permian?  With this increasing the treadmill is turning up to 11.

1339 2018-01-17 21:01:09 If your air filter is dirty, it creates a 'rich' mixture, causing you to lose mpg....and can eventually damage your engine.  Check and change it at your next oil change.
1340 2018-01-17 21:00:52 I think so. Usually if it’s just peanuts or just peanuts and oil it can go stale or rancid. So doesn’t hurt being in the fridge if you’re not going to use it all up soon

1344 2018-01-17 21:00:28 I just witnessed the Presidents limousine on tv, looks like it needs a oil change and tune up.

1352 2018-01-17 20:59:28 There you have it. I live in Alaska. We have enough oil for generations to come and enough guns to defend freedom of speech for that long as well!
1353 2018-01-17 20:59:26 got home to find my parents had bought a shit ton of oil pastels and sketchbooks of all sizes this afternoon for my bday 
1354 2018-01-17 20:59:14 Opi nail envy is amazing. Also, lots of really good quality cuticle oil every night
1355 2018-01-17 20:58:58 ATTENTION: MINERAL OIL - Check your Cosmetics especially Lotions or other products absorbed on your skin daily. Mineral Oil blocks the absorption of the very Important Fat-Soluble Vitamins A, D, E and K.
1356 2018-01-17 20:58:52 You do use gas don't you? Environmental regulations are often purposefully put in place to cause economic harm. Progressives aren't against oil drilling. We're against oil spills and pollution.

1362 2018-01-17 20:58:15 you mean like...........Oil Spills???
1363 2018-01-17 20:58:09 Since you did away with the oil spill cleanup fund, sure hope you are ready to tell your constituents why you have to use their state money to clean up the mess you created.
1364 2018-01-17 20:57:51 Missed your tweet on being sick! Glad you are feeling better. Sidenote: Oil of Oregano. I stand by that product, at the 1st hint of a cold!!

1374 2018-01-17 20:56:31 To Horatio: I understand that you're chill as an ice cube even though you're surrounded by a family that's as hot as boiling oil. But remember what happens when you drop an ice cube INTO a vat of boiling oil. #nobueno @hamletljcds
1375 2018-01-17 20:56:28 It's true. That's why people are sceptical, so many shit owners in our past. Even well meaning ones. I wouldn't trust power a far as I can throw him. My opinion is he's a snake oil salesmen.

This has the potential to be spectacular, and spectacularly bad. Who the hell can tell.
1376 2018-01-17 20:56:17 i quite agreee as some pals may not know about palm oil
1377 2018-01-17 20:55:56 I’ve been using Wild Growth oil for my hair and it made my eyelashes longer. 2 birds, one stone

1389 2018-01-17 20:54:20 @ChaseIronEyes Hey are you aware of the #BillS1948 a bill introduced by Senator @clairecmc (Who sat silent while we were attacked oil police) which aims to take away tribal sovereignty. Seems as of late we have to fight more and more to protect our rights. #MniWiconi
1390 2018-01-17 20:54:09 Crayon is good. Oil paint is better but suffers from the potential to fail at first contact with the enemy
1391 2018-01-17 20:54:00 Well come, lemme find out u be using coconut oil lol
1392 2018-01-17 20:53:55 No you have set the country back 50 years! Coal and oil are not the energy sources of the future!
1393 2018-01-17 20:53:38 Wait until all that new oil drilling starts up...hope you're ready for that  mess! $3.8 billion clean up cost to Exxon will be peanuts compared to what's coming.
1394 2018-01-17 20:53:30 I've once filled urine and palm oil together  in my neighbor's generator b4...
1395 2018-01-17 20:53:30 Again largest expansion of offshore oil drilling and exiting Paris agreement, please tell me how that's progressive?
1396 2018-01-17 20:53:29 i bought primrose & milk thistle supplements and new/better rosehip seed oil. since this is my review twitter now I'll let u know how it goes
1397 2018-01-17 20:53:22 @alexbellotti Hi Alex are u still writing for Ham& High? I cant place you anymore and sent you an invite to the Olive Oil Gala Dinner on 23 Jan at Osteria Dell'Angolo Westminster, if you can come? thank u, Luisa
1398 2018-01-17 20:53:19 We apologize for the frustrations. It is normal over time, if not used on a regular basis that some oil can settle and separate causing it to leak out. Unless the mixer has lost a fairly large amount of oil (¼ cup or more) this is most likely not a concern.
1399 2018-01-17 20:53:16 For shiny hair, mix one egg with a olive oil and apply to your hair. Leave it on for 20-30 minutes then shower.
1400 2018-01-17 20:53:14 I'm not even talking about the sowing seed in the pastors life.  I'm talking about total expenses.  if I put out the amount these soo called professional will claim I'm frying dodo with engine oil.
1401 2018-01-17 20:53:11 Spiders hate peppermint oil. Put some in a squirt bottle + water and spray your garage and all door frames.
1402 2018-01-17 20:53:02 I honestly don’t track it that thoroughly. I’m doing abt 1500 calories a day, I have lots of eggs, chicken, beef, fish with TONS of vegetables like lettuce, mushrooms, peppers, cauliflower rice, use olive oil or grape seed oil. I sometimes have some low carb nuts, and that’s it
1403 2018-01-17 20:53:01 #AskPTA other then inherent vice and oil! Any other books you’ve considered adapting/stealing from for a film?
1404 2018-01-17 20:52:50 so it turns out what ive always considered to be oily skin might actually be severely dehydrated skin over producing oil as a cry for Help
1405 2018-01-17 20:52:30 Why do I always have anxiety when I have to get my oil changed??
1406 2018-01-17 20:52:28 Dende oil is explosive in its own gastric ways
1407 2018-01-17 20:52:27 You know oil and coal aren't the future don't you? If not you're in denial or you're lying to the public. Knowing you, you're lying.
1408 2018-01-17 20:52:24 Not in favor of electric cars trying to be facetious. There are bigger problems mining minerals for batteries than their are with oil
1409 2018-01-17 20:52:13 The Dems and Libs only become concerned about bullying women who are either Dem or liberal in ideology. Bookers' comments and theatrics were uncalled for and illustrate the low levels a politician will stoop, to sell their Snake Oil.
1410 2018-01-17 20:52:11 YAY! Glad to hear your doing better! Please relax and take it easy and let the magic meds do their thing.
Glad they didnt have to do that roter-rooter thing and blast it to bits and the meds are gonna do it! Phew!
1411 2018-01-17 20:51:54 Stuff is definitely hit and miss! But these two I like for under makeup to control my oil (also helps bc i’m acne prone). I also LOVE their Himalayan charcoal mask ... she’s that girl. It’s the best honestly
1412 2018-01-17 20:51:52 Man, i oil my shit before i go to sleep and when i wake up 
1413 2018-01-17 20:51:51 Ahhh the memories. Trips to U pull junk yard, find rear suspension from station wagons that can fit you car. The busted knuckles, transmission oil in your hair and gear oil down your back. Then learn how to drive your car again cause of the understeer. Yea I'll do it again 
1414 2018-01-17 20:51:50 I texted my mom to ask if vegetable oil and crisco oil were the same and 15 text messages later I still don’t now...
1415 2018-01-17 20:51:50 We all know oil prices aren't their fault, however their actions during the crash is the problem. The ndp distance themselves from oil prices when it crashed but take credit when the economy slightly picks up thanks largely to higher oil prices. You can't have it both ways
1416 2018-01-17 20:51:28 You mean grow cynical....so much so they buy the lies of a snake oil salesman and a bunch of right wing tories....I don't think so.
1417 2018-01-17 20:51:12 i really need some australian @doterra peeps so i can get manuka oil!
1418 2018-01-17 20:51:06 Pretty sure that's what happened to my mom. She got a thing that shoots some peppermint oil in the air every 30 min "for health reasons."
1419 2018-01-17 20:50:57 the option interest over 32k the projected market maker mover +- .59
technically looks like she will rip thru 20
the anticipation is good earnings with oil over 60 plus tax reform should allow them to guide up  Just depends on how the call goes
1420 2018-01-17 20:50:56 She is a NIMBY. Wants oil exploration away from the US, to put other countries' citizens in harms way.
1421 2018-01-17 20:50:54 Wisdom teeth are woeful and then they pack the cavity with gauze doped in clove oil and no matter what you eat the next few days tastes of cloves
1422 2018-01-17 20:50:43 Not only has Trump opened up offshore drilling, but protections put into place to prevent another Deepwater Horizon disaster have been scaled back, and the tax per barrel of oil that was being collected to clean up future spills has been eliminated. What could go wrong?
1423 2018-01-17 20:50:42 Coconut oil is rich in antioxidants and has antiviral, antifungal, and antibacterial properties. When used on human hair, it improves the scalp health, fights various infections and fungus, and supports general hair growth, all while adding a beautiful shine.
1424 2018-01-17 20:50:40 Right. Why would Pruitt want a job where he could suppress the vote when he's elbows deep in destroying the environment and kissing big oil?
1425 2018-01-17 20:50:25 Hey T, remember when you said oil prices would bounce back in 6 months?  That was 2015.  Now y'all is quittin' with your buddy in the White House?  Seems like what ya don't know could fill a bitcoin farm.
1426 2018-01-17 20:50:19 compared to Trump, just about anyone would be acceptable. I was no fan of Bush, and always thought him kind of an amiable doofus controlled by Cheney and the oil industry. Unlike Trump, I never thought he was a traitor.
1427 2018-01-17 20:49:49 Her daughter and every human being deserves to live in a planet that isn’t in danger because of fracking and oil pipelines- which @JBPritzker profits from.

1429 2018-01-17 20:49:40 We’ll buy a couple of oil drums tomorrow and bleed the system *fingers crossed

I’ve my electric blanket on already so ‘im all right’ lol stuff the other two x

1431 2018-01-17 20:49:27 Wouldn't it be great to render Middle East oil inconsequential to our nation's security. Think of the peace dividend.
1432 2018-01-17 20:49:26 insight: When oil bulls are crashing (Astenbeck, Bp capital), shareholders angry at millitant managements, & even large caps can't borrow anymore to pay div - 
investing in oil could become very lucrative...
1433 2018-01-17 20:49:10 if you have some jalapen~os to put in your soup, that's good too. Or you can add cayenne pepper or regular pepper. If you really want to cut down on inflammation, take some turmeric with your peppered soup. Or if you're feeling crazy, roast some garlic with oil and eat it.

1435 2018-01-17 20:49:05 $100 for an oil change because I didn’t want to do it myself in sub zero temps. Teaches me.

1438 2018-01-17 20:48:49 I was on an oil platform offshore, the platform was rocking for a long time. We were on 700' stilts and the place was swinging wildly. Very scary.  Never heard anything about a possible tsunami.
1439 2018-01-17 20:48:44 I mean I guess some petro’s sound like a fitting reward? Or like, maybe you’d prefer a barrel of oil instead? Either way, it’s clear you’ve got a crystal ball.
1440 2018-01-17 20:48:23 Taxpayers paying top dollar for the services of Merlin! Who cares if you or your children become injured workers without these judges time? Need more pills paying higher bills making illusions of higher wages? Seal up another pyramid & enjoy the CEOs burn that midnight oil.
1441 2018-01-17 20:48:14 If u can get to a derm metrogel really helped my rosacea if not I’d try The Ordinary’s niancidimide! If I’m super dry I sleep w sweet almond oil over my moisturizer! Or Weleda skin food is super thick and amazing overnight.
1442 2018-01-17 20:48:09 I am sure this has nothing to do with oil.
1443 2018-01-17 20:48:08 Yet again trying to get across to the spawn that some things are /just/ mommy's even if they get left in the stroller. Said stroller and kid currently doused in Clarins lip oil. 
Sigh
Mid-day bath it is
1444 2018-01-17 20:47:59 your ignorance to actual progressive issues is deafening.   Maybe the largest expansion of offshore oil drilling and appointing oil industry lobbyists to EPA and etc.
1445 2018-01-17 20:47:57 A gov enforced monopoly where your taxed once for what you don't want, then if you have enough left you can then purchase what you do want.

1447 2018-01-17 20:47:46 You weren’t heard from when the country told you that we didn’t want the trump taxscam, and you voted for it. Now you want everyone to know you are interested in these rinky dink committees. Just who do you speak to, your oil co. friends?

Internet Service Providers

The administration has acted in a way that goes against the best interests of the citizens of this country. Why?

For the last 2yrs my dads been giving him cartridges w cannabis oil, he hasn’t taken a pill since & his back isn’t hurting
1465 2018-01-17 20:45:21 The Dems and Libs only become concerned about bullying women who are either Dem or liberal in ideology. Bookers' comments and theatrics were uncalled for and illustrate the low levels a politician will stoop, to sell their Snake Oil.
1466 2018-01-17 20:45:21 Is it not ironic that a moron conned by a snake oil salesman feels qualified to be correcting the sentence construction of others? Without punctation.
1467 2018-01-17 20:45:19 It's been awhile since I've done that.  I used diluted clove oil once to help the pain, and that was a good temporary solution.

1469 2018-01-17 20:45:12 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1470 2018-01-17 20:45:10 Thank you. I'll try it and does it work for you? Someone told me about coconut oil today but eeeek I have oily skin.
1471 2018-01-17 20:45:08 Pizza is a lot nicer than warm oil.
1472 2018-01-17 20:44:53 Why such concern about oil & gas workers? Didn't see ANY concern for pressmen, bank tellers, telephone operators, postal workers...
1473 2018-01-17 20:44:44 Rock up to Jiffylube for a $29.99 oil change & bankrupt the company
1474 2018-01-17 20:44:30 Amazing. They think oil materialises straight from the North Sea right into a bank account.

1478 2018-01-17 20:44:14 Also, you eat steal cut oats with oil and cheese?!!?!
1479 2018-01-17 20:44:11 Whoa! At least maybe it isn't dipped in cold pressed coconut oil
1480 2018-01-17 20:44:09 Just got quite an education on the oil business...and learned my math is a little rusty.
1481 2018-01-17 20:44:03 Sometimes they're pretty cryptic, like I'd get comments just saying "Lamp oil" on Morshu-related videos
1482 2018-01-17 20:44:00 Yes, the self clean will burn off the protective layer of oil.  Bare cast iron will quickly oxidize.
1483 2018-01-17 20:43:53 Maybe on an oil soaked beach somewhere, Gulf Coast? I hear Prince William Sound still has oil 2 inches under the surface, just the top is clean.

1488 2018-01-17 20:43:42 So I added an extra product to my hair after washing it this morning. Issa yes! After diffusing this morning my curls a pop pop popping!!! I still need peppermint oil on my scalp though...
1489 2018-01-17 20:43:38 Organize some oil for Ricky as well, he is going bald.
1490 2018-01-17 20:43:33 So clarification is necessary. Do you think all deregulation is bad, or just on oil companies?
1491 2018-01-17 20:43:23 Why has every biscuit now got Palm oil in the ingredients
1492 2018-01-17 20:43:13 The Desk and Derick club is a wonderful association of women supporting our Texas oil fields. I Just finished my luncheon keynote in WICHITA Falls for them.  Smart ladies.

1521 2018-01-17 20:40:03 I didn't say that & I know that we often don't meet goals for reasons outside our control. What I said what that the talk about fiscal discipline and living out of cash flow cannot be reconciled with 1,881 more tight oil DUCs in 2017 than 2016.

1546 2018-01-17 20:36:37 Only if you want to be a billionaire. If not, you can just support the oil sands and the CEO's for those companies. I'm not saying you specifically will do anything worth while in the energy sector. I'm just saying some capitalist will.

1552 2018-01-17 20:35:53 The Trump Administration is working to open up the most pristine aspects of our environment to big oil, gas and other industries. The only thing of interest to them is the acquisition of more money for the 1%. This is a greed driven disaster for our country.
1553 2018-01-17 20:35:50 1. shaved brussel sprouts marinating in lemon, garlic, a bit of bacon oil, salt pepper and i will bake/roast with bacon.
2, marinated chicken in honey mustard with garlic, apple cider vinegar, salt and pepper which will be coated in grounded honey mustard gf pretzels.
1554 2018-01-17 20:35:42 That's a sound reasoning which the article failed 2 bring out. It's also a fact that Turkana, on acct of high poverty index & previous marginalisation, gets larger allocations from NG & equalization fund. These will go down when oil revenues flow in. Expected boom may never come.
1555 2018-01-17 20:35:05 keep going on about City and oil money and where they would be without it?  where would Utd be with James Gibson??
1556 2018-01-17 20:34:48 We were talking about lightbulbs and how they used to use whale oil for lamp oil and he said that they were telling people to use lightbulbs and save whales
1557 2018-01-17 20:34:31 Hi  it was just whole grain mustard, honey, lemon juice, fresh dill, salt, pepper & olive oil...enjoy! 
1558 2018-01-17 20:34:18 Yes it does! I used it faithfully for 6 months and had great results. SN: I have naturally full brows that were damaged by a bad wax job. The castor oil helped it get back to its natural state. Idk if it'll grow hair that was never there.
1559 2018-01-17 20:34:17 Big Oil keeps CT warm, Sgt Toys for Tots. But how would you know -- you're the senator from Puerto Rico now.
1560 2018-01-17 20:34:15 @AMummyToo Hi Emily not sure if you received my email invite to Olive Oil Gala Dinner 23 jan at Osteria Dell'Angolo Westminster. Would you be ableto come?Looking forward to hearing from you, many thanks Luisa
1561 2018-01-17 20:34:11 KJVA Bible. Psalms 55:20-21
[20]He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he hath broken his covenant.
[21]The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords.
1562 2018-01-17 20:33:36 Okay the oil bath bomb things are so cool 10/10 would recommend
1563 2018-01-17 20:33:06 Why is it yellow? Queso is white? And why isn't it thicker? It's runny and seems full of oil
1564 2018-01-17 20:33:05 #Graze's fries are made from fresh cut Kennebec potatoes, twice-fried Belgian-style in Non-GMO rice bran oil and seasoned with kosher salt. #Tucson
1565 2018-01-17 20:33:00 Thanks I was thinking the same. I've not used oil paints for many years.
1566 2018-01-17 20:32:51 Tofu!!!!! Also protein! Tahini! Pumpkin seeds! Rapeseed oil! Hummus!
1567 2018-01-17 20:32:38 I’m a bit disappointed that most meat substitutes seem to contain palm oil.....
1568 2018-01-17 20:32:32 Melting up to DOW 27,000.  
As long as oil is in $60 to $70 bbl sweet spot and dollar remains weak, then global economy will continue to perform well despite the EU.
1569 2018-01-17 20:32:29 Pour moi tout allait bien j'avais plus mal et tout mais le cheloide est apparu au bout de 6mois.. J'ai du mettre du tea tree oil, c parti mais ça revenait et quand j'ai changé le bijou j'ai plus rien eu
1570 2018-01-17 20:32:26 It's when the lesbian and the gay have an oil spill I think
1571 2018-01-17 20:32:20 The Trumpian part is he says he’ll do this and also reduce taxes, all based on conspiracy theories he’s peddled for years about Mexico’s “real” and “hidden” oil revenue. He’s also anti-gay, anti-choice, and openly pandering to Evangelical Christians. Seriously.
1572 2018-01-17 20:32:15 #TrustMeImADoctor  sponsored by coconut oil
1573 2018-01-17 20:32:10 Oh it not matter how u cook in marriage.. here's how it be going down, u try cook something once, spill a little oil on stove, then be banned from kitchen for "almost setting house on fire" while wife complain about how much she hate cooking...
1574 2018-01-17 20:32:05 Hilarious that you show oil field workers while claiming that POS @BarackObama gets credit for current economy. FYI, that POS fought against O&G every step of the way, putting roadblocks up at every turn with BS unlawful rules.
1575 2018-01-17 20:31:58 "Environmentally friendly" is probably mostly a PR term. However, nuclear has a relatively small material footprint due to its density. For transportation, I would leave oil and natural gas for a long time and use nuclear to replace as much coal generation as possible.
1576 2018-01-17 20:31:41 A way for al gore and others to profit massively off taxes, while they pollute me than any of us combined. Al gets a check from occidental oil each year too, let then drill exclusively etc. Then use they bad data in models. It's called weather. Lol
1577 2018-01-17 20:31:39 There are multiple ways that you can use coconut oil in your daily skincare routine. Some prefer to use it as a moisturizer, while others apply it as a natural makeup remover.
1578 2018-01-17 20:31:30 There’s not going to be any demon in this house. My Grandma and I are getting the oil and sage out tomorrow and casting them out..that demon can go work somewhere else
1579 2018-01-17 20:31:26 To those who say Iraq War was a ‘mistake’ - We... got rid of a non-compliant state; created chaos, enabling big oil to get in, & causing terror backlash, giving our security services something to do; gained military presence & influence in region; created profits for war industry
1580 2018-01-17 20:31:26 When people think mayonnaise is a dairy<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< it’s a fat.... it’s literally eggs and oil........
1581 2018-01-17 20:31:24 Doing some reading on Kuwaiti oil and bloody hell they were swimming in oil in 1958.
1582 2018-01-17 20:31:10 my olay moisturizer & tee tree oil has really been doin justice to my skin 
1583 2018-01-17 20:31:05 It's the sugar,flour,corn and canola oil that is causing a obesity epidemic
1584 2018-01-17 20:30:48 bitch... oil changes are so expensive .........
1585 2018-01-17 20:30:46 Stir together 4 1/2 tbsps caviar with 1 pound elderberry. Mix in Olive Oil. Chill.  Serve for brunch

1587 2018-01-17 20:30:34 nah the worst thing is when someone on my course left oil in my hair (from an oil treatment) so I had to walk around college all day with greasy hair
1588 2018-01-17 20:30:27 It’s like everybody in Lagos is using perfume oil
1589 2018-01-17 20:30:20 New Battery New Headlight Bulb Oil Change New Beep Beep Ting
1590 2018-01-17 20:30:14 I out eucalyptus oil in the diffuser and Emily said and I quote "I feel like a koala" bc apparently they eat a lot of it but then she got upset bc when they eat too much of it it messes up their teeth and they can die.  #lifewithemily
1591 2018-01-17 20:30:12 hot oil treatments do well also.
1592 2018-01-17 20:30:02 That's a fair point about his captaincy, the Oil could use more leaders outside of Looch.
1593 2018-01-17 20:29:58 You can’t beat a delicious organic carrot - roasted in some olive oil and sprinkled with a bit of salt and rosemary from the garden mmm...
1594 2018-01-17 20:29:56 does motor oil make good lube.
1595 2018-01-17 20:29:48 Dude real talk, I had my first public speaking class in the attic of our library in ‘08, and there was just this giant oil painting of some past president of the university from like 1915 just chilling in the front. Light barely worked. I had loved to be in the gym boiler room.
1596 2018-01-17 20:29:40 Oh and I just got a sample of @TooFaced  Perfect I really hope this does a fantastic job at controlling my oil! So excited to try!
1597 2018-01-17 20:29:18 They simply hike the rate per instructions they rec eive from big brother. Good economy and job creation etc are just noise. Our mining, oil and forest industries are under stress, what good evonomy?
1598 2018-01-17 20:29:12 "The Lundin Oil Company, where Carl Bildt was a board member 2000-2006, operated mining exploitation in South Africa in spite the UN boycott against the apartheid regime"
1599 2018-01-17 20:29:03 Not everyone is a natural born killer & there are other ways to gain that That sh*t dont cut no ice where the "pirates" live & work 
Oil rigs, Road crews, Ship Wrights Coal Miners Construction crews and any other place guys with big arms swing big tools :-)
1600 2018-01-17 20:29:03 Like how to cook rice in a microwave, how to bake things in oven, not to use metal spoon for non-stick pan, how to use dishwasher (we don't have this back home), to always wash wooden spoon & dry it immediately so it won't be rotten, to swap the excess oil with paper towels, etc
1601 2018-01-17 20:29:00 Prevent black spot and mildew on your #roses by applying a weekly #organic fungicidal spray. You can add 2 teaspoons of bicarbonate of soda, one drop of biodegradable dishwashing liquid, plus half a teaspoon of horticultural oil to 2 litres of #water and wet all the foliage
1602 2018-01-17 20:28:59 And then once you get it down, the fish oil repeats on you! Can't do it anymore - the brain cells and joints will have to look after themselves. Good luck!
1603 2018-01-17 20:28:58 For those 50 years the places majority of Blacks live run by Democrats. Many still in denial of ANY correlation in conditions/ leadership
1604 2018-01-17 20:28:42 Also, local health food shop in my little town sells CBD oil at the counter.  It's a blessing for people with autoimmune diseases.  Thanks Victoria for leading the way in these neanderthal times.
1605 2018-01-17 20:28:38 Within 3 generations there'll be 10 billion people on a planet that can sustain 2. Peak oil will throttle energy, jungles will be depleted, seas will be empty & most animal species will be extinct. And people on social media will still be complaining about fucking clothing labels
1606 2018-01-17 20:28:38 @anamariecox @NPR They will B filled by oil executives
1607 2018-01-17 20:28:35 I guess this jackass won’t be satisfied until there are oil spills throughout the entire country
1608 2018-01-17 20:28:26 Seriously...what good does the oil do if there are no fish to fish....
1609 2018-01-17 20:28:17 The we can't afford to stop oil we have to use it while their so sick and can't see it BC they use Jesus and this ruling excuse it's to force Jesus to rule
1610 2018-01-17 20:28:17 Healthy? Chemicals in low cal oil spray, low fat custard, etc are NOT healthy! Stop sending out bad health messages
1611 2018-01-17 20:28:14 Yes inspecting the shelves are important and this one is defective!  yes we’re ok and we are warm as mums heating isn’t working(she’s getting new heating but it will be a few months before it’s installed ) but Mum keeps me warm with the oil radiator and electric blankets x
1612 2018-01-17 20:28:11 I’ve had a protein shake, Epsom salt bath and covered myself in magnesium oil after that intense spin class.. if I ache tomorrow I’ll be fuming!
1613 2018-01-17 20:28:07 try putting some clove oil on the affected tooth
1614 2018-01-17 20:27:49 Cocoa broke out. Gold & silver turning on strong divergence. Sugar coming back to my buy zone and euro turning with dollar bouncin whilst oil behaving as mentioned. So far my analysis is playing out exactly as planned. Love it when hard work plays out. Now lets make some moneyy $
1615 2018-01-17 20:27:40 Yep oil is what they treat forms with. Good call.
1616 2018-01-17 20:27:35 #NP Neil And Adam @neiladammusic - Oil Fire on @Ultimate365R
1617 2018-01-17 20:27:24 I might give it a look. I read a few books that discussed the region prior to any US entrance into it prior to my deployment. The region wasn’t exactly a great place prior to US companies finding oil there.
1618 2018-01-17 20:27:20 He's an oil exec, he has a lot of practice ignoring local sentiment outside of America
1619 2018-01-17 20:27:10 I use Buffet 2x a day, hyaluronic in the morning and retinoid and argan oil in the evening. I almost never have to supplement with lotion.
1620 2018-01-17 20:27:03 He says he's not a servant, he feels he owns the countries oil just a few things that show that it's not about people wanting him to serve, but him staying in power
1621 2018-01-17 20:26:49 Really cheap but surprisingly good: Radox destress (eucalyptus and rosemary I think). Although I do then add a squirt of baby oil once the bubbles have formed
1622 2018-01-17 20:26:42 People recommending crypto to their friends and family are snake oil salesmen
1623 2018-01-17 20:26:42 Ocean currents people ocean currents oil is less dense than seawater middle school science folks
1624 2018-01-17 20:26:41 Psst @teroterotero - Oil up, bitcoin down. Just sayin...
1625 2018-01-17 20:26:40 Loads of people "liking" but where is the evidence or do they just believe it cos it's "said". How bizaree? By the way, I ain't a Tory. But it's a bit like saying "We have oil therefore we are rich".
1626 2018-01-17 20:26:23 No oil til Saturday fml
1627 2018-01-17 20:26:10 first painting class omg oil paintin tiring

1630 2018-01-17 20:25:53 along the same lines as the DRC, Congo, Zimbabwe and Uganda.  South Africa was almost 100% self reliant when I lived there they only needed oil.  Now look.
1631 2018-01-17 20:25:47 Please give them their caliphate and give Biafra Jews and Christians their REFERENDUM. Oil and water can never be ONE. Common sense@real Donald Trump.

1639 2018-01-17 20:25:01 ... unless you have the right for delivery ... but probably not in this case. If you can't get your oil or urea delivered to your house then it's not backed by anything. Just backed by promises.
1640 2018-01-17 20:24:30 I also love them roast with garlic and a little Olive oil.
1641 2018-01-17 20:24:29 I hope to one day return to earth as a highly overrated oil exec

1645 2018-01-17 20:23:58 Little do people know I did investment research for commodities (write reports on news and gas/oil/shale). Literally every single stock on Hotcopper forums had the same cycle. The problem is that people think it's a unique thing. It's speculative commodity period.

The New York post has a fake news list and Dutchsinse is on it for calling out the USGS hiding and down grading earthquakes for oil companies and also the volcanos that are going off on the West Coast.

1661 2018-01-17 20:22:15 Basically meaningless at this point as per reasoning for award. Just a formality given becse they gave a shiny bauble to the Pope.

1663 2018-01-17 20:22:12 Is this a 1st step before inevitable cooperation between US and Russia after dust settles? A deal for Gazprom to build nuclear power plants using the ilmenite they've been hording? Perhaps a Syrian, ExxonMobil & Rosneft oil deal, a precursor deal leading to a revived Arctic deal?
1664 2018-01-17 20:22:01 Diets rich in vegetables, nuts, olive oil, berries, fish, and whole grains (such as the Mediterranean diet or the MIND diet) have been shown to improve working memory and lower the risk of Alzheimer’s.

1674 2018-01-17 20:20:10 Soak your fingertips in some sweet almond oil, on a regular basis, and the oil will moisturize both your nails and your cuticles. If you don’t have sweet almond oil, you can use olive oil or coconut oil instead #beautytips
1675 2018-01-17 20:19:47 But you're not against oil drilling, you're only against oil drilling in the states. All for it as long as it is outsourced and doesn't help the GDP.
1676 2018-01-17 20:19:44 There's been due diligence here from others. Just sucks having to cite that snake oil salesman. He'll be bragging about this until 2019. Gotta cite first reporter though unfortunately.

Take a bow DOI for NOT SERVING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
1682 2018-01-17 20:18:51 The frightening part of this act of stupidity is that one or more of these rocket scientist find themselves in a position of authority beyond deciding to put the French fries or tater tots in the oil first.
1683 2018-01-17 20:18:48 People who leave oil blotting sheets places are disgusting. No one wants to touch your oil
1684 2018-01-17 20:18:26 Actually, all joking aside, 10 mins in the microwave to soften the middle a bit then rub butter/oil in the skin and crisp it up in a hot oven for 20
1685 2018-01-17 20:18:19 Can I ask you about Jojoba oil? I want to make Beeswax papers for covering food and the Pinterest source suggests Jojoba oil. I would personally prefer just beeswax.

1718 2018-01-17 20:12:24 I understand your country is investing billions in to renewable energy....  Is this the end of oil?
1719 2018-01-17 20:12:15 Idk how to do it  I know you stick a thing in the oil container and it’s supposed to fill up but idk much else
1720 2018-01-17 20:12:09 Yes it is many adjustments that our crown prince MBS  is taking proceed apac to create different ways of money income rather than oil which become cheap nawadays and most of the countries try to use diffeent source of energy now we have plays concerts and cinema soon

1725 2018-01-17 20:11:43 Try crush a little bit of it into any oil you're using maybe? Or sprinkle some extra on mid cook? (I am not a very good cook myself, so take this with several pinches of garlic salt.).
1726 2018-01-17 20:11:43 Basically the American oil companies blackmailed PET into dropping his National resource plan. Big American oil wanted our resources at cheap prices and the shut down the oilfield until they got it. Pete Canada was the only real result. Which the Cons sold as soon as they could

1735 2018-01-17 20:10:41 @Audi_Online #audi  My A4 2011 consumes 1lt of oil every 350km. It is a manufacturing problem of the 2.0TFSI engine between 2011/2013. They have taken over the repairs around the world. In @AudiArg with all the tests done, they analyzed it more than two months ago. Any solution??

1749 2018-01-17 20:09:26 That's recycled cooking oil for you 
1750 2018-01-17 20:09:24 Yeah, and yet somehow the theme is utterly irrelevant to how creepy they are. Houston has space and oil themed ones, I don't even remember what the Dallas ones are. (Is brown and sad a theme?) I just keep my head down and get out as fast as possible.
1751 2018-01-17 20:09:20 So I'm sitting at Jiffy Lube, getting my truck's oil changed, and the dude came up to me and was like, "you are out of oil and coolant completely, and honestly I'm not sure how you even get it here." All I could do was ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

1759 2018-01-17 20:08:28 In the past 85% of our state funding came from oil revenues. Today, it's less than 30%... 57% of state funding, is from our savings accounts.

1774 2018-01-17 20:06:24 Think of your product like an organism—growing, shifting, decaying—not an oil painting; a "finished" masterpiece.

1786 2018-01-17 20:03:52 That's right. Biodiesel from vegetable oil isn't an excellent choice. But remember that the 50 % reduction EV's are expected to deliver isn't even in line with current EU sustainability requirements on biofuels.
1787 2018-01-17 20:03:50 You just demonstrated your clear lack of knowledge. 

The US has unrefined oil sitting in cargo trains all over the Eastern Seaboard from fraking.

We are now exporting oil at low prices as demand drops.  This is negatively impacting countries that derive their income from oil.

1791 2018-01-17 20:02:56 With you in this. Gld Feb puts at 122. Oil still has one more bump up into 65.70~ but that's the end of that as well I think
1792 2018-01-17 20:02:55 Each country that wants crypto "security" has a national hedge fund (oil wealth? idk) that plays the dumb lottery, so local elites can still cash out if BTC price fluctuates wildly during transport, the sovereign fund just takes the hit.

1821 2018-01-17 19:59:18 i ordered pizza just a few min ago...i am going to eat all that oil
1822 2018-01-17 19:59:08 First rule of family. Take care of your own first. If we’re going to make the world a safer place we must stop funding terrorists by buying ME oil. Offshore production can help.
1823 2018-01-17 19:59:07 @ThanePrince Hi Thane, not sure if you saw my email invite to Olive Oil gala dinner on 23 Jan at Osteria Dell'Angolo Westminster - have not heard from you. would be great to see you.Shall I resent?thank you, Luisa

1825 2018-01-17 19:58:46 hack: lavender oil is great for healing tattoos!!! Heals v fast, soothes pains and itching, keeps it moiserised and makes the shedding a lot easier
1826 2018-01-17 19:58:38 Wait, I thought we wanted national parks and monuments to close? You know, so we can sell their minerals and oil.
1827 2018-01-17 19:58:32 You guys, @EcocoBeauty commented on one of my ig pics and I’m SHOOK. I literally use their olive oil gel everyday of my life 
1828 2018-01-17 19:58:26 I buy them raw ( not grown them as yet  ) - brilliant cooked slow in sea salt, butter & olive oil  & thyme finished last 10-15 minutes with drizzle of Balsamic into the cooking juices - a much underrated vegetable
1829 2018-01-17 19:58:25 After getting an oil change in my car now I’m on my way to get my eyebrows done

1833 2018-01-17 19:57:48 Steam (2 times a day) with 1 small spoon eucalyptus oil in water (this is for mucous build up), warm water with honey & grated ginger (this has to be force fed :( ), and honey to sooth scratchy throat late at night, given right before bed (this helps my 5 yo sleep better).
1834 2018-01-17 19:57:48 People blowing on about United spending our own money but don't hear a word when City or Chelsea spend 100's of millions of oil money  #MUFC #BecauseWeCan

1836 2018-01-17 19:57:45 I was frying eggs..  Simple eggs .. 
And now my hair smells like cooking oil .. Like how 
1837 2018-01-17 19:57:44 I make hair oil for the girls that have used every method known to man to increase Hair growth and still don’t see progress. Sometimes hair vitamins and Jamaican black castor oil is just not enough! The oil I use is life changing.
1838 2018-01-17 19:57:43 I worked for 2 international oil companies, and both communicated to staff that they they targeted market median comp for staff. Both stated top quartile comp for execs, and one openly stated they wanted the CEO to be highest in Canada. Not motivating
1839 2018-01-17 19:57:41 Waff road, opposite Forte Oil.
1840 2018-01-17 19:57:38 a much better developed country than the rest of Africa apart from Nigeria which has oil
1841 2018-01-17 19:57:16 @SecretaryZinke Are you going to turn our parks into oil rigs, fracking fields and garbage sites so you can follow Trump's agenda which is to rape our lands for profit. These are the people's land and we don't like it when people want to ruin it.We will fight you and corruptness!
1842 2018-01-17 19:57:13 Oil up and flaunt it big boss style *Rick Ross grunt*
1843 2018-01-17 19:57:11 For those who've found all essential oil blends ineffective in their diffusers and switched to sanctified water, we do pray. #sacraments #diffusing @UnvirtuousAbbey
1844 2018-01-17 19:57:04 The United States also produces other liquids that are used in the crude oil refining process, other liquids that are added to refined petroleum products, and other liquids that are used by the petrochemical industry and other consumers.
1845 2018-01-17 19:57:00 Before you litter them with oil drills and mining equipment?

1847 2018-01-17 19:56:49 It's so important not to put harsh chemicals on your skin you guys , when I was in high school I had the worst acne from products like proactive , it literally made my skin worse / treat yourself & care for your skin with natural oils like coconut oil & tea tree , you'll see 
1848 2018-01-17 19:56:45 I need TP for my bunghole.
1849 2018-01-17 19:56:39 My face is so dry but once i put makeup on (matte foundation) it gets SO oily. I walked to my first class and looked at my face on my phone and it’s like an oil slick 
1850 2018-01-17 19:56:25 Here is fun Fact about Rex Tillerson you see Fracking is not new tech, as a matter of fact, it's pretty old 1950 ish so all that oil all that gas has always been there and always been available so why did we pay five bucks a gallon?
1851 2018-01-17 19:56:22 We wouldn't have WM voting to allow removal of devolved powers as they did last night. We wouldn't host Trident, or become involved in illegal wars for oil and wealth. That would be a good place to start for me.
1852 2018-01-17 19:56:01 In a 500 ml water bottle;
1- Add 100 ml water and add food color of your choice. U can also add glitters 
2- Add around 350 ml vegetable oil. Actually the more oil the better
3- let them both settle and introduce as much eno as u can from the top. 
NOW U HAVE A LAVA LAMP.
1853 2018-01-17 19:55:53 5 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies:
Thou hast anointed my head with oil;
My cup runneth over.
6 Surely goodness and lovingkindness shall follow me all the days of my life;
And I shall dwell in the house of Jehovah for ever
1854 2018-01-17 19:55:17 Good grief. It terrifies me that so many people use EOs on their kids when they're unsafe. A friend's pediatrician said she prefers no usage, but gave the okay for diluted peppermint oil, diffuser only/no direct application, and only for 6+ aged kids.
1855 2018-01-17 19:55:16 Go with oil. You only live once. Make it fun. Even if...shorter.
1856 2018-01-17 19:55:01 @AzizSapphire Please see the GASPE Conventional Light Oil play , low cost production with the SAYABEC at 20% Porosity at over 150 Meters thick
1857 2018-01-17 19:54:58 I like olive oil, but not olive oil cake.  It just doesn’t taste right.
1858 2018-01-17 19:54:55 everyone comes to me with all their coconut oil questions  I love it coconut

1859 2018-01-17 19:54:53 Didn’t we just find out last month Russia was providing oil to NK?
1860 2018-01-17 19:54:51 im gonna put some hair oil treatment from lush in my hair then clean while it sits them wash me hair and retwist it yeehaw gonna be a long ass day already
1861 2018-01-17 19:54:50 Me: “my hair smells like rosemary and olive oil because of my shampoo!”
Boone: “so you smell like a damn Italian salad?!?”
1862 2018-01-17 19:54:49 I could see her going the other way--being a big hippie organizer in college, then realizing there isn't any money in it, then marrying a rich oil exec
1863 2018-01-17 19:54:39 @LondONtheinside Hello Jules. How are you! Wondering if you received my email invite to Olive Oil Gala Dinner on 23 Jan at Osteria Dell'Angolo Westminster - would be great to see you.look forward to hearing from you. Luisa
1864 2018-01-17 19:54:37 @realDonaldTrump I don't know what your dr will say of this but my mother in law could not take crestor cuz of muscle ache side effect so she tried flaxseed oil but doubled the dose and it worked! (she's allergic to seafood so she could not use fish oil) It might be worth a try.
1865 2018-01-17 19:54:34 U r great

1867 2018-01-17 19:54:22 That's not due to skilled labor. They are rolling in oil and natural gas... They are wealthy because of natural resources not because they invent or even work hard. They sell oil.
1868 2018-01-17 19:54:22 lost my favourite oil for my hair back in december 2017 and hav just found it. 2018 is blessed xx
1869 2018-01-17 19:53:49 i mean uhhh bep bep i drink oil
1870 2018-01-17 19:53:47 “In the 20th century, the United States endured two world wars... the Depression; a dozen or so recessions and financial panics; oil shocks; a flu epidemic; and the resignation of a disgraced president. Yet the Dow rose from 66 to 11,497.” - Warren Buffett
1871 2018-01-17 19:53:28 I threw my coconut oil at my bf today when he was getting on my nerves.
The coconut oil is fine.
1872 2018-01-17 19:53:23 Proves oil money can be smart money instead of just f u money
1873 2018-01-17 19:53:23 Again maybe if he didn't need to clean up the housing crisis republicans or the BP Oil issue also republicans or the opiate issue also republicans in the middle east protecting big pharma with america patriots lives and let's not forget freddie Mac due to republican lobbyist.

In the constitution it says they can sell what belongs to them.

1890 2018-01-17 19:51:05 Basically, big oil and their sycophants love talking about the 'renewable future', but they make their inveatment decisions in the full knowledge that it will never arrive.

1893 2018-01-17 19:50:07 Concentrated THC that's an oil, can be shatter or a full oil piece, used with a rig that has to be heated up to melt it down. It's some high level smoking shit.

1896 2018-01-17 19:50:00 I’m not a massive fan of Trump, although I appreciate and understand the fact that at last there is someone in the White House prepared to stand up for the big guy - to protect the un-persecuted minorities like oil barons and billionaires.
1897 2018-01-17 19:49:52 Shout outs to not being willing to pay the royalties to get green hill zone chemical plant zone and oil ocean zone music but having already done that twice for the generations remixes and the sonic 1 & 2 album.

1905 2018-01-17 19:48:46 NO Government Shut Down. Being a Disabled American Veteran I truly could use my pay to get food and heating oil next month. How about the Government work for "WE THE PEOPLE" instead of ILLEGALS ?
1906 2018-01-17 19:48:26 @felicityfood Hi Felicity how are you?Not sure if you got my email invite to the Olive Oil gala dinner on 23 Jan at Osteria Dell'Angolo Westminster,would be great to see you, plenty of veg food. Look forward to hearing from you. @luisawelch

1909 2018-01-17 19:47:48 I am glad to say that I made a deal with @RocketPapaKim and North Korea to supply them with extra oil. We look forward to seeing their economy grow
1910 2018-01-17 19:47:45 Initially I started this website because I wanted to sell the Hair oil I use to keep my hair healthy and long but now I’m adding shampoos and conditioners for your specific hair styles as well! Curly, straight, and braids/twist styles  
1911 2018-01-17 19:47:39 Oil preventing primers are (arguably) more bullshit than a moisturising one. You can’t stop your skin producing oil (you can delay it with powder but you can’t ultimately stop it) but you can easily add more moisture through your skincare.
1912 2018-01-17 19:47:36 No just just sending oil tankers
1913 2018-01-17 19:47:30 Koch brothers father was best friend with Stalin and started the families wealth on Russian oil. RYAN answers to the Kochs
1914 2018-01-17 19:47:29 Russia has two interests in US politics. One is they want to sell oil sanction free and two is that an the NATO treaty stands in the way of territorial aggrandizement in Eastern Europe. WRT NATO both Wikileaks and Trump are both good wedges to drive into that alliance network.
1915 2018-01-17 19:47:26 ALL pizza tastes good the next day. Some pasta, like stuff with a lot of oil in it, won't taste as good once it's settled. 

But what do I know? I eat food straight out of the refrigerator, I have no control.
1916 2018-01-17 19:47:22 I can remember the scenarios in the white paper, they most definitely were not facts.
Oil price scenarios and "remain constant" ringing any bells?
1917 2018-01-17 19:47:18 The recent fire and sinking of an Iranian oil tanker in East Asia may be a sign and an omen for the Islamic Republic of Mullahs and this ship may just be the vessel to do the real job!
1918 2018-01-17 19:47:04 The answer is simple. People are stupid and they got conned by two snake oil salesmen. On the other hand, it is very difficult to deal with honesty. Reality is not a fun thing. And, yes, Haiti and many African nations are shitholes. Nothing against those poor people but it's true
1919 2018-01-17 19:47:03 Anyone know where I can get some cbd oil? Dm me please
1920 2018-01-17 19:46:53 You seem to belittle oil spills, deforestation, coal ash spills l, mountain top removal, smog, respiratory issues, etc

I've said they do have impacts but they are smaller and when improving something you need a point of comparison.

Why keep the worse system?
1921 2018-01-17 19:46:48 “Teatree oil is good for allergies and skin irritations”... 
now my face is well oiled up, looking like freshly fried puff puff.
1922 2018-01-17 19:46:42 Jeff and I smoked an entire gram of oil yesterday, ate a bunch of snacks, and then took a nap
1923 2018-01-17 19:46:41 Finals ain't good for health. All those nights spent burning midnight oil, unhealthy meals and the amount of stress.
1924 2018-01-17 19:46:37 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
1925 2018-01-17 19:46:16 I got an email from a Seattle-based beauty company asking us to mention their article about naturally sourced coconut oil on WOHM and I blame @ayocovi for this.

There's no other explanation.
1926 2018-01-17 19:45:52 Never thought the engine would malfunction... maybe I shouldn’t have put in that olive oil.
1927 2018-01-17 19:45:50 I also use it and it really does get oily. Need a dewy foundation now so maybe that's why I don't mind the oil look
1928 2018-01-17 19:45:43 What's the best oil to coat myself in so I can slide down the aisles?
1929 2018-01-17 19:45:37 like oil & water those 2
1930 2018-01-17 19:45:31 Face masks and oil wraps in your hair .. are my kind of vibes

1932 2018-01-17 19:45:27 Oil and water ! Democrats vs Republicans ! This country deserves better from our elected representatives. Please note: I'm blaming all politicians that disparage each other not just "old news" Nancy ! @EricTrump @FoxNews

1934 2018-01-17 19:44:49 I finally mixed coconut oil and olive oil together and have been using that on hands and lips
1935 2018-01-17 19:44:48 You could try adding a bit of a face oil like farsali to it or whatever similar face oil there is. Also honestly a hydrating or moisturising primer underneath will make a lot of difference despite people that say primers are bullshit.
1936 2018-01-17 19:44:46 We all know it will solve no problem, Eny3 de3 ehia nie. Before Lithium, there was gold, diamond, bauxite, oil and many more........
1937 2018-01-17 19:44:39 Oh good to know! I’ll have to get one of those for comparison’s sake. The main difference here seems to be sunflower oil vs aloe oil. Who would have thought sunflower was better? 
1938 2018-01-17 19:44:32 Why do people get upset when oil gets spilled in the ocean? Those fish are rich af now
1939 2018-01-17 19:44:23 Moisturizing my eyebrows daily in Jamaican castor oil. They stopped growing when i stopped using it a year ago.

1947 2018-01-17 19:43:09 "sure, the dented chickpeas, sour groundnut oil and stale paprika are best before last May, but they'll make a surprisingly palatable end-times hummus when the shops stop opening"
1948 2018-01-17 19:43:00 @RepAlGreen  Please protect sea turtles,  other marine wildlife and America’s coast by publicly opposing the expansion of offshore oil and gas drilling!
1949 2018-01-17 19:42:44 Getting paid to get an oil change. This what’s up
1950 2018-01-17 19:42:39 It's a big Texas oil tycoon!
1951 2018-01-17 19:42:34 And off shore coastal oil reserve drilling

1953 2018-01-17 19:42:24 @pureliving4life Look into a Fumoto valve to replace oil drain plugs with.  It’s life changing.
1954 2018-01-17 19:42:23 I agree, and oil is their national priority. And the decision to sell nuclear weapons stocks still says something about them.
1955 2018-01-17 19:42:23 You earn 100k and below a month. You sef you know the money isn’t enough to take care of your own needs. Babe said she can’t date cause she doesn’t want to be a burden.

You are now upset. 

Bolts in your head need engine oil.
1956 2018-01-17 19:42:17 if you can do oils on your face, Josie maran argan oil is the bomb. Doesn’t take a lot and you will be glistening!
1957 2018-01-17 19:42:09 Drilling isn't going to effect the price of gas. We have an oil glut now from fraking
1958 2018-01-17 19:42:08 oh, i hear you. in that case, oil rubbed bronze then, for sure.
1959 2018-01-17 19:41:55 Bitcoin can do a better job at the filling the commodity money / investment diversification role occupied by gold / oil / base metals, and should take portfolio space from them.
1960 2018-01-17 19:41:36 I really don’t understand why oil changes take so long at a dealership y’all sell only a few brands at each location at most. Technology gets better and better but y’all get slower and slower
1961 2018-01-17 19:41:35 あーなんて表現しようと考えてたんですけどその感じですね…！
非現実的というかゲームちっくというか
1962 2018-01-17 19:41:18 . Losers, both
1963 2018-01-17 19:41:17 I should just start a project to paint more horrible pictures of celebrities in oil on canvas and make an exhibition of them that no one will attend
1964 2018-01-17 19:41:15 Sounds lovely. Will the risotto also come with the option of ‘His’ oil? 
1965 2018-01-17 19:41:09 It may be something to do with it being called Socialist Islamic state of Iran. They also have oil, like his mates in The Socialist Republic of Venezuela.
Maybe he just like backhanders and bungs
1966 2018-01-17 19:41:05 The other oil producing countries jumped in and filled the gap...they made lots of money off the circumstances.
1967 2018-01-17 19:40:44 @SebGorka As ever, a great performance on #SkyNews #MichaelWolff - “Snake Oil Merchant”  it!
1968 2018-01-17 19:40:41 Buying a ford truck is literally the worst investment a human can make no joke changing the oil is an absolute chore.
1969 2018-01-17 19:40:34  @JoannaBlythman. Much palm oil produced in Malaysia, clearing the rainforest, destroying the habitat of such wonderful animals as orang utans. The discontinuities caused by random forest clearance leaves "islands" too small to sustain viable populations. DON'T BUY PALM OIL!
1970 2018-01-17 19:40:34 Not being funny but there's literally NO excuse for dandruff in 2018 while olive oil exists
1971 2018-01-17 19:40:33 Where can I get my oil changed for like $20
1972 2018-01-17 19:40:28 I think there would be a rapid realignment of professions, and our food-harvesting labor issues would ease.

My bet for limiting factors would be whether we could convert all energy consumption to renewables and nuclear before the oil and coal ran out.
1973 2018-01-17 19:40:22 リーダーなーに怒ってるんスかー？(｀∀´)σ=σ (その後殴られる
1974 2018-01-17 19:40:14 You stole my lamp oil AND my rupees!
Bombs is all i have!
1975 2018-01-17 19:40:10 Oil pulling.
1976 2018-01-17 19:40:09 エクストラバージンオイルってなんか卑猥だよね。
1977 2018-01-17 19:40:08 Would LIKE to say we are surprised to see something like this happen. A city that size wanting money from the oil companies....... seen it all now.
1978 2018-01-17 19:39:48 Hard to write blatantly anti Man Utd articles using only accurate information. 
The attempt to make big spending Utd the 'bad guys' in relation to dodgy Thai now ME oil baron billionaire owned City is a farce.
1979 2018-01-17 19:39:22 Subway is calling my name.. a nice cold sandwich wit some oil and vinegar and mayonaise 
1980 2018-01-17 19:39:15 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
1981 2018-01-17 19:38:49 Another serious question who’s money is Man Utd spending?? That’s right the money they generate in revenue as the biggest supported club in the world. City & PSG spend oil States money & nothing is ever questioned regarding wages & agents fees. Typical biased views
1982 2018-01-17 19:38:37 ULTIMAX KEY OILってなんか強そう。
1983 2018-01-17 19:38:34 Magnolia oil from pep..
1984 2018-01-17 19:38:32 do you put any oil on before you try off from the shower?
1985 2018-01-17 19:38:30 Magnolia Tissue oil from pep (R20) does the things
1986 2018-01-17 19:38:15 @binnyjs Hi Binny I wondered if you received my email invite to the Olive Oil gala dinner on 23 Jan at Osteria Dell'angolo Westminster. glad I found you on twitter, wold be great to hear from you. @luisawelch
1987 2018-01-17 19:38:12 OIL DIFF: 5.48 -> 5.58
1988 2018-01-17 19:38:10 Got my uncle friend to buy my extensions, shampoo and conditioner....
Then I walk out and bloody remember I needed coconut oil *sighs*
1989 2018-01-17 19:37:51 On the humble if you enjoy giving hot oil treatments see me. This might just be your year
1990 2018-01-17 19:37:43 the West uses and abuses takes the riches oil, diamonds raw materials  of the third world . this is a fact .
1991 2018-01-17 19:37:31 It can work. U gotta double wrap ur hair, a tiny drop of oil for ur edges so the sweat doesn’t dry them out, and u have to leave the main scarf on til it and ur hair r 100% dry

1993 2018-01-17 19:37:23 Witch hazel and coconut oil have really been blessing my skin lately
1994 2018-01-17 19:37:18 Under traditional procurement - would it? The point I make is that *all* the costs under PFI are ultimately coming from the public sector. These aren't the natural profit making sectors you often find project finance in, such as oil and gas. The money comes from govt.
1995 2018-01-17 19:37:18 Climate Change opponents crack me up when they say scientists like Bill Nye, etc. are "paid off" to spread climate change information... I guess they just ignore the $700 million spent every single year by oil and coal companies to spread anti climate change myths and propaganda
1996 2018-01-17 19:37:06 I got the cleansing oil & the enzyme rice powder! I have the watercream sample too but I have a hydrating primer that I like better so I didn’t get the big size! 
1997 2018-01-17 19:37:00 Man someone should clean that sludge up in the water ......and while their at it maybe they should clean up that oil in the water also!!!
1998 2018-01-17 19:36:50 We hail the govt. That good.more grease and oil to their elbow  Election fever is catching.  This govt will have to deliver between now and election. I think they are pushing for it.  EFFC shine your eagle  eye.  Value for money. Nigeria we hail thee
1999 2018-01-17 19:36:45 #trading biggest ever % of large speculators are long EURUSD, gold, copper & oil. (CFTC & Bloomberg reports). So what? So, expect a big drop in prices shortly.....
2000 2018-01-17 19:36:23 I love my oil pen today at lunch that was depressing idk how I lose everything
2001 2018-01-17 19:36:18 Buddy next to me in class asked if I smoke kush. I said yea and he gave me some of this raw ass kush oil to drop in my mouth and now I’m fried so
2002 2018-01-17 19:35:59 Yes! We know. But are McCain ot any other GOP members calling for this President’s Impeachment? The answer is NO! Spineless puppets of the Big Pharma and Big Oil lobbyists. #TaxScam #TaxHeist
2003 2018-01-17 19:35:55 ですなぁ！！ほんと、喜ばしいことですw
2004 2018-01-17 19:35:54 I got my tart cherry juice & my oil of oregano, and I'm attacking this illness! Thank you @Jenn_Mattern
2005 2018-01-17 19:35:48 Reached the word “oil” in reviewing the index for my book. Wow. That’s a lot of entries. #SaudiInc #oil #OOTT

2007 2018-01-17 19:35:43 Olive oil as lube. Works well.
2008 2018-01-17 19:35:36 @hollowlegs Hello Lizzie,I was wondering if you received my email invite to the Olive Oil Gala Dinner 23 Jan at Osteria dlel'Angolo Westminster. Would be great to see  you, looking forward to hearing from you. @luisawelch

Anyone know anything stronger than bio oil, happy event and palmer's?
#GirlTalkZA
2010 2018-01-17 19:35:28 I've switched to using coconut oil as moisturizer and it has changed my life

2012 2018-01-17 19:35:20 apparently haven't had my oil changed since AUGUST what the hell i swear it'd only been 4 months..
2013 2018-01-17 19:35:20 Will #NYC b happy when no oil gets delivered to their city and people freeze??
2014 2018-01-17 19:35:11 mine too. i vitamix an entire lemon and 1/4 cup olive oil and drink that shit
2015 2018-01-17 19:35:07 2018 oil and gas game on my mind
2016 2018-01-17 19:35:06 Strategic Positions:

The North West/East have the military/security. 

The Niger Delta has the crude oil/militants. 

The South East has trade/defunct IPOB militants?

The South West has finance/defunct OPC militants?

The North Central has disparate militias.
2017 2018-01-17 19:35:05 Do you mean that socialist:
"...one of Alberta's most popular premiers, Progressive Conservative Peter Lougheed. He was the premier who, among other things, started a government-run oil company, bought an airline, created a human rights commission and spent lavishly on the arts"
2018 2018-01-17 19:35:05 Oil
2019 2018-01-17 19:35:03 Let's not talk about Qatar's oil 
2020 2018-01-17 19:35:02 Tea Tree Oil for MRSA? I don't think so.
2021 2018-01-17 19:34:57 No I got a empty spray bottle from Walmart and added peppermint oil. I spray my hair Morning and night and massage it into my scalp. YouTube Aloe Vera for relaxed hair but find out hair prosperity first. That helps by finding the right hair products for your hair growth.

2024 2018-01-17 19:34:51 I'm not saying these band's shouldn't support the oil and gas industry,  I'm just saying it's odd they would oppse a green project.
2025 2018-01-17 19:34:51 And purchasing oil in rubles, crashing demand for US dollars plummeting their value! America First? America will be last (and at that point, pretty much over). This was Russia's final "hail mary" to save their oil-based economy and Trump and GOP gave it to them.
2026 2018-01-17 19:34:32 Hmm, can’t see a foaming bath but I think I squirted hand & bodywash into bath & it was LOVELY. Also is bath essence but that is an oil
2027 2018-01-17 19:34:14 If you haven't used Oil of Oregano yet, you are doing your disease ALL wrong!!!!
2028 2018-01-17 19:34:09 I need one of my black owned business to make a poppin face scrub, body scrub and organic tea tree oil. Thanks in advance!
2029 2018-01-17 19:34:08 Trader Joe’s also carries a tea tree oil cleanser that’s all natural for less than $5!
2030 2018-01-17 19:34:06 if youve been wanting to try the IT cosmetics cc cream and their pathetic shade range doesnt cater to your skin tone, coverfx natural finish foundation has a similar texture w better coverage and wear time. only diff is coverfx doesnt have spf and its oil free where IT cc has oil
2031 2018-01-17 19:33:55 Aren’t they just amazing??? Do you have a humidifier too?? I put eucalyptus oil in it too.
2032 2018-01-17 19:33:54 posturing self-serving publicity seeking little snake oil pedlar abuses memorial to those who gave all fighting petty nationalism he pushes
2033 2018-01-17 19:33:51 We use a olive oil which we get from @TheBodyShopUK  Tiny little bit on the ends before bed works a treat 
2034 2018-01-17 19:33:44 I started using CBD oil to help with my anxiety and let me tell y’all 
2035 2018-01-17 19:33:43 Play snake oil! (Or you and Aaron could do it on the podcast even)
2036 2018-01-17 19:33:43 You do oil and foam cleanse? Even if you don’t wear makeup?
2037 2018-01-17 19:33:41 The Lord prepares the table before me in front of my enemies; He anoints my head with oil!
2038 2018-01-17 19:33:39 inject coconut oil into your heart. fucking. jam it in there. fuck. fucking. bathe in it. stick your face in it. fucking. coconut oil RAW
2039 2018-01-17 19:33:30 When they add the whip cream and shit you just add thc oil into it as well may come out a tiny green but it would work
2040 2018-01-17 19:33:24 It's perfectly acceptable to trump and republicans who are eliminating regulations and fines for the oil and gas industry.
2041 2018-01-17 19:33:18 Is it really that difficult for you to decipher? It means we could have a relationship with Russia to help with NK but we do not, so what China Takes back (oil, goods) Russia gives back. #Clueless #FakeNewsAwards
2042 2018-01-17 19:33:18 Put coconut oil on his fur ; it’ll help neutralize.
2043 2018-01-17 19:33:17 Lot 66: Idles Rough, Engine Oil Leaks Noted, Mast Hydraulic Cylinder Leak, Coolant Reservoir Contamination
2044 2018-01-17 19:33:09 Lot 64: 43 Foot Length, Body Damage Throughout, Left Front Hub Oil Leak,
2045 2018-01-17 19:33:08 Help @KitchenAidUSA! My mixer started leaking oil last night after I used it to make cookies... this can’t be normal. 
2046 2018-01-17 19:32:49 Oh! He doesn't want to drill for oil, it's to get himself lower than anyone else, the best low, believe me...
2047 2018-01-17 19:32:42 My oil change today cost me almost half of what I paid in the DC area for my previous one.
2048 2018-01-17 19:32:33 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.
2049 2018-01-17 19:32:19 That’s the name of the oil in your hand mate try again
2050 2018-01-17 19:32:10 So your plan as governor of Florida is to convince the president of the United States that the hoax of climate change is real, get him to admit everything (whatever that means) and stop drilling for oil everywhere.   You been to California and smoked ganja with Gov Moonbeam?
2051 2018-01-17 19:31:50 If I had to break it down to 5 steps, though, it would be the oil cleanse, foam cleanse, toner, eye cream, face cream.
2052 2018-01-17 19:31:33 U.S. crude #oil futures settle at $63.97/bbl. $0.24. +0.38%. #CME #NYMEX $CL_G7 #OOTT #OPEX

volume: ~397k (rest of vol. on march)
2053 2018-01-17 19:31:31 Not if the right-wing (Cotton, Miller, Purdue) are poring molten oil in his ear daily and feeding his racist prejudices. The only way to force him to deal is to get him to see that if the govt. is shut down, he and the GOP will be blamed. Dems have leverage.
2054 2018-01-17 19:31:22 @XantheClay hi Xante not sure you received my EMAIL invite to Olive Oil Gala Dinner on 23 Jan at Osteria Dell'Angolo Westminster, hence this tweet. Shall I resend/ would be great to see you,thank you  @luisawelch
2055 2018-01-17 19:31:15 Wasn't the deep horizon oil spill bad enough? And 11 men died.
2056 2018-01-17 19:31:13 Meanwhile theses two bands have benifit agreements with the oil and gas industry.  They support fracing.
2057 2018-01-17 19:31:08 Lead them from Temptation, make them royalty, all the things we facing, make us question it, lead us to salvation, pour that oil please, thats how we become Kings and Queen 
2058 2018-01-17 19:31:01 Man has olivio oil in his fucking hand
2059 2018-01-17 19:30:58 CNN and the truth... that is fucking trying to mix oil and water
2060 2018-01-17 19:30:51 Jack if you voted for the Tax Bill maybe Trump might listen to you about your oil issue? Your technique vote no and name call the Pres is questionable. Who got the bonuses, pay raises and jobs for RI. Wait till the reduced w holding hits next month. Think
2061 2018-01-17 19:30:41 I like wax, especially sugar wax, as it is easy to infuse into oil or butter for cooking, and it is also nice in a vape or atop a bowl.
2062 2018-01-17 19:30:41 I don't get why Republicans and President Trump are so big on coal and oil when clearly renewable energies are what we'll be doing.  Why drill when Ford and Volkswagen committed billions to electric cars?
2063 2018-01-17 19:30:25 Damn I laughed but a women giving hot oil treatments and teaching you skin care routines is top 2 and it’s not 2
2064 2018-01-17 19:30:17 Oil Change, haircut, Chipotle, office, flag football game, Tallahassee. I'm already tired.
2065 2018-01-17 19:30:14 Heating oil pipe can be shot inside to break the valve and fill water or detergent to block heating of sieged object.
2066 2018-01-17 19:30:12 too much oil and fat
2067 2018-01-17 19:30:11 “There’s a lot of sass in this room right now and I think it’s because of those essential oil candles.” @KyleErwin

2070 2018-01-17 19:29:29 Hey! The cream and the oil are my favorites and truly work in my opinion
2071 2018-01-17 19:29:13 Are you serious??? Did you lived in YU? Bread reduction, oil reduction, wheat reduction, electricity reduction, one bankrupt etc. All in YU. Check your facts.
2072 2018-01-17 19:28:59 Canada & CBD Oil is what is gonna move the needle here, also helps to have management locking down a majority of commons.
2073 2018-01-17 19:28:57 Pero thank you Lord makakatulog na rin after a busy day. Busy day pa rin mamaya pero sige lang. 
2074 2018-01-17 19:28:54 Tell me what the bonus and rentals are. Renewing a lease is generally much cheaper than drilling a well. That's my experience after 40 years in the oil business. Maybe yours is different.
2075 2018-01-17 19:28:43 @youngandfoodish Hi Daniel, @luisawelch here. Hope you received the invite to th Olive Oil gala dinner on 23 Jan at Osteria dell'Angolo - no pizza on the menu but lots of gorgeous olive oil. Looking forward to hearing fromyou?
2076 2018-01-17 19:28:43 You go for a oil change they try to get you to buy a new car damn near lmao
2077 2018-01-17 19:28:38 Cluckabee Flanders is not a press secretary. She is a carnival  expecting us to BUY her toxic snake oil product of fake benefits and miracles. She's a fraud,like her boss,and I hope her Echo buys her matching eyeballs this time.
2078 2018-01-17 19:28:24 Haaay hectic.
2079 2018-01-17 19:28:23 Fatih Birol should stop sitting on two chairs. He reminds me of the tortured souls described by Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides. His WEO quotes on RE always sing with optimism and then he talks about global oil demand surging thru mid-century. Is he ok? #divestinvest #getREAL
2080 2018-01-17 19:28:20 Robot sharks are a sensible fear. I, on the other hand, am scared of oil rigs and the hidden bits of boats.
2081 2018-01-17 19:28:11 Trying to figure out why my house smells like old fryer oil? 
2082 2018-01-17 19:28:11 @iamsmade coming out with Beard Oil, now that’s something we can all support. #BlackEnterpreneurs #SupportYourOwn #BeardGangThing
2083 2018-01-17 19:28:08 Organic for combined is laughably thread-bare. 4 alkanes, crude oil, fractional distn, cracking, combustion done. I did 20 minutes on geopolitics today to pad it out.
2084 2018-01-17 19:28:02 A tip for if you’re doing #Veganuary, add coconut oil to every dish, makes it easier to slide off your plate into the bin x
2085 2018-01-17 19:28:00 @Loztastique I am having a terrible time with my Nordic Ware honeycomb pan, no matter how much I oil/butter/flour my pan the cake always sticks. Any pro tips? Otherwise gonna have to find it a new home as it drives me nuts lol
Thanks in advance 
2086 2018-01-17 19:27:59 Despite Oilers 2 wins, rough week for fans cheering against other western conference teams. Should now take ~98-99 pts to make playoffs. Leaves Oil with 55 pts needed in 36 games. Best approx for OT losses for the rest of the way is still 5, so they need 25 wins in 36 games...
2087 2018-01-17 19:27:56 I think I'm going to try watercolor instead of oil paint... I CAN LEARN
2088 2018-01-17 19:27:46 They learned VERY well f/ Kennedy and Kerry, who together DECIMATED the centuries old New England fishing industry..and still to this day foreign factory ships lay off our waters STEALING OUR FISH (Our oil & gas as well) The Japanese say thank you very much to both of them 
2089 2018-01-17 19:27:39 Isn't grauding the world about natural gas and oil evil to make money? Isn't treating me like I don't have a voice BC I'm not god evil?

2091 2018-01-17 19:27:28 Uses for used soybean (cooking) oil... Some say it can be poured outside since it's a vegetable, non-solidifying oil and they use it for compost, some say it's not healthy for the environment. What say you?
2092 2018-01-17 19:27:27 what was i doing with my life before i discovered coconut oil
2093 2018-01-17 19:27:24 Efficascent oil is my bestie nowadays
2094 2018-01-17 19:27:15 Isn't that explanation cool? I couldn't stop laughing. Because she's right. She also went on about how I have fireball. She has web + flammable oil. I said, "I'm for whatever works." She laughed and said, "Sorcerer."

2097 2018-01-17 19:27:08 That was such a massive environmental disaster I am so concerned about the huge quantities of dispersant and oil in the Gulf. I am worried about the loss of life, the dead zones, the disease permutations...it is horrible
2098 2018-01-17 19:27:08 
2099 2018-01-17 19:26:57 the renaissance will be fantastic and is sure to provide grate new opportunities for suppliers of oil paints and horse hair
2100 2018-01-17 19:26:47 Grey: Mechanicus Standard Grey, Dawnstone Highlights
Blue: Possibly Kantor Blue and Hoeth Blue, or maybe the Russ Grey shades
Yellow: Averland Sunset (I'd use Ushabti Bone or Flayed One Flesh for highlights)

Recess shade the grey and blue with Drakenhof Nightshade or Nuln Oil
2101 2018-01-17 19:26:41 A face mask and a hot oil treatment 
2102 2018-01-17 19:26:30 Very similar, but with more spice. Sarah is allergic to peanuts, so she can't eat Thai since it's all cooked in peanut oil. It's good stuff though.
2103 2018-01-17 19:26:30 Liar. You are attempting to cripple the future of energy by refusing to admit oil is dine
2104 2018-01-17 19:26:26 The Chinese start trading oil futures in Yuan tomorrow (for them).  I doubt they will be buying oil.  LOL  #OOTT
2105 2018-01-17 19:26:23 I know basic cravings like fries or chocolate but do you ever crave things like steamed broccoli with olive oil and chilli because I do
2106 2018-01-17 19:26:11 Gets new tires, gets expensive ass oil change, windshield wiper fluid, new air filter, alignment, one week later windshield wiper breaks in half. Why is my reality so damn complicated 
2107 2018-01-17 19:26:09 Awe Gets some peppermint oil or Vick’s vapour rub under your nose to help you wake up.  Good luck today. Hugs
2108 2018-01-17 19:26:03 I can't believe Nyc is suing oil companies over global warming theory.I wonder who is paying for that
2109 2018-01-17 19:26:02 So glad that Mania OST has finally come out.
A little confused as to no Green Hill, Chemical Plant or Oil Ocean though. I'd imagine conflicts with Nakamura, but Generations OST is on iTunes so...
2110 2018-01-17 19:25:56 You ever going to do that Saudi oil vs oilsands report? Or just these talking points that get ridiculously low traffic..
2111 2018-01-17 19:25:41 Oh, just about the heating oil and not presidential elections?
2112 2018-01-17 19:25:39 ツイートで確認してました！
戦艦や空母たちを差し置いて龍田さんだけをレベル99にしたまま放置してるはずなので諸々落ち着いたら久々に会ってきます！！！
2113 2018-01-17 19:25:32 I like so much oil and vinegar on my sub that it drips down my arms when I take a bite
2114 2018-01-17 19:25:27 but wouldn’t the added oil break it up even more? bc i have super oily skin and i think it’s what’s separating it and caking it up. i’m gonna try my dense buffing brush though, i’ve been trying it with a stippling brush and maybe it’s not dense enough. ty!
2115 2018-01-17 19:25:19 Never tried that interesting
2116 2018-01-17 19:25:14 当たり前なんだろうけど、こんな時間でも撮影か………
2117 2018-01-17 19:24:49 It is sad that you are frauding about oil using excuse you think anyone who speaks up to royalty or trump is evil.isn't murder
2118 2018-01-17 19:24:35 Their tactic is to befriend you, bring in other friends until your life is full with activities and shared hobbies, if you are a knitter, they will  you in the group! 
Wanted to learn oil painting? There are classes and day trips to the museums & scenery YOU ! #calculated!
2119 2018-01-17 19:24:33 The Niger Delta region holds a strategic edge over other regions in the country. They have crude oil that can be exchanged for weapons and food. They are naturally trained in marine warfare. If they mean it, we can all have a national conversation.
2120 2018-01-17 19:24:33 it's basically just wash with soapy water, dry out, reheat, rub with vegetable oil
2121 2018-01-17 19:24:28 I've been seized by this notion that putting coconut oil in my ear will take down the swelling I am probably wrong
2122 2018-01-17 19:24:27 So I got the Thayers witch hazel in cucumber cause I couldn’t find the lavender one and I already started seeing improvement. Tea tree oil for my dark spots (that stuff tingles) Aztec healing clay mask, African black soap and deep sea mud mask and African Shea butter
2123 2018-01-17 19:24:18 Go to my room and get some magic oil 
2124 2018-01-17 19:24:18 according to their website:  "Lodge seasons all of its cookware with soy vegetable oil and nothing else."
2125 2018-01-17 19:24:15 @KitchenBee Hi Bee was wondering if you got my invite to the Olive Oil gala Dinner on 23 Jan at Osteria Dell'Angolo Westminster! Sent about 2 weeks ago Would be great to see yo.Lookign forward to hearing from you. @luisawelch
2126 2018-01-17 19:24:10 And bio oil! But be consistent (bc im not and got mad scars)
2127 2018-01-17 19:23:57 OMG, I didn't even know you could do that! I'm losing weight and my stretch marks have their own zip code so I may start using it on them! The oil is a miracle worker for sure!
2128 2018-01-17 19:23:01 Local rapeseed oil or beef lard for me.
2129 2018-01-17 19:22:51 I smoked from a pen this weekend with that oil shit and let me tell y’all how good that high was. I usually don’t smoke cause it’s not my thing and the feeling is wack. But this shit was fireeeee!

2131 2018-01-17 19:22:47 Saving the wildlife is #1, by using #rayelectricoutboard you will help by not putting more gas and oil in the water.
2132 2018-01-17 19:22:43 Getting my oil changed and #FoxNews is on in the waiting room. I might spontaneously combust. 
2133 2018-01-17 19:22:38 Okay it's a hell of a list.
Etude House Real Art Moisture oil cleanser
Cerave foaming facial cleanser

Back alley skies, the wind in our clothes

In blanket forts with oil pastels
Run it back, back to the start of our song"

2135 2018-01-17 19:22:26 @indiasturgis Hi India, I was wondering if you received my invite to the Olive Oil Gala Dinner on 23 jan at Osteria Dell'Angolo Westminster? Would be great to see you,looking forward to hearing from you. Luisa @luisawelch
2136 2018-01-17 19:22:05 U don't have common sense fuel prices are being charged at crude oil prices in int market on a daily basis what was the price previously
2137 2018-01-17 19:22:04 เหมือนจะไปยากกก5555
2138 2018-01-17 19:21:59 And you really think rUK will stop buying our oil, whisky, water, electricity, salmon etc etc when they will still want to sell us their goods? UK increased trade with Ireland after it became independent and they intend to keep trading after Brexit.
2139 2018-01-17 19:21:57 “Samosa” means a dish made from meat in minced form, covered in thin pastry, cooked in hot oil and whose shape shall only be a triangle;
“Vendor” means anyone who sells Samosa for profit
2140 2018-01-17 19:21:40 Reason #9182737465 We need to rethink oil. It's killing out environment! They spill more than they transport at this point.

2142 2018-01-17 19:21:11 Why Oil Is About to Hit Troubled Waters
2143 2018-01-17 19:21:05 Some people swear by using a menthol or peppermint oil on your temples and back of your neck
2144 2018-01-17 19:20:35 And what type of warm oil? My money is on crude.
2145 2018-01-17 19:20:35 Having a bit of #balm making fun with #stjohnswort oil
2146 2018-01-17 19:20:35 I am a taxpayer. I am a voter. I want the carbon levy- it is going directly to diversifying our economy. I'm sick of our economy being a pawn in the global oil market. You should be too. Unless you prefer the economic rollercoaster we've been riding.
2147 2018-01-17 19:20:35 I got an oil change done on my car and now I’m last minute getting new tires... I hate adulting.
2148 2018-01-17 19:20:26 490k a week! Surely not! Remember when City ruined football with oil money 
2149 2018-01-17 19:20:22 Potentially going back to the promise land #Oil
2150 2018-01-17 19:20:13 Beard oil and my wallet 
2151 2018-01-17 19:20:01 I want to thank all of you for following me!This is the year We fight back! Yesterday went good & set's up the Wave that's coming! We must Unite bc the Russian propaganda pretending to be Dems! We must vote together all of us! That sends the message.We The People Not Big Oil!
2152 2018-01-17 19:19:59 Looks like motor oil.
2153 2018-01-17 19:19:54 Fellas, dab of olive oil (extra virgin) and a bit sugar to exfoliate. Rinse with cold water
2154 2018-01-17 19:19:31 it's super easy too, you just have to dump the steaks in a plate of flour and then in a frying pan with the wine and oil.
2155 2018-01-17 19:19:29 2 oil barrels, one wrong step... er, spell.
Kaboom.
No more party, enemies all alive in wtf mode.

2161 2018-01-17 19:18:54 stress level: my car’s dashboard switching between saying there’s 5 miles left of gas and saying i have 2% oil remaining
2162 2018-01-17 19:18:52 making roast potatoes & onions in tinfoil with a tiny splash of olive oil, salt and lots of pepper (less fat than oil soaked roasted) & a big salad... cooking for winter is cozy. It's a snow day so vino. I'm working from home I promise. I'm also the only one cleaning this house
2163 2018-01-17 19:18:47 Idk man, no matter how far technology progresses nothing is ever gonna have more functions than coconut oil
2164 2018-01-17 19:18:41 And ever since Bea got her oil done, she been on that bs 
2165 2018-01-17 19:18:24 Hey @StepUpOklahoma what is your tax plan for Agriculture?  You tax oil and gas but what about Ag?
2166 2018-01-17 19:18:14 & if tories didnt mismanage our oil funds then we wouldnt have any money issues..we lose billions a year &we cant do jack shit cos we R in a great union.. that cash could go on  heaps of gr8 things instead we dont see a penny why wldnt they let us have a oil fund??ask URself that
2167 2018-01-17 19:18:00 Snake oil has never not been a thing
2168 2018-01-17 19:17:57 With the price of oil at a high the price of gas at the pump has been consistently increasing during January. Do Rs realize that whatever increase there is in take home pay will be more than wiped out by paying more for gasoline
2169 2018-01-17 19:17:54 But is ok to drill in the middle east and pretty much everywhere else in the worl right? But our supply of crude oil cant be used? Silly goose
2170 2018-01-17 19:17:51 ALL energy sources have advantages & disadvantages. The main advantage of coal in many places is that it is cheap.
Oil and natural gas are excellent energy sources.
Nuclear & hydro (if you have the resources) are excellent for electricity generation.
The value of RE is dubious.
2171 2018-01-17 19:17:48 No, Russia is helping North Korea.  That's why their oil tankers keep visiting them.  China could care less either way.
2172 2018-01-17 19:17:42 Great media event for the MFA Oil Company Break Time Shootout today! Can’t wait until Saturday !

2177 2018-01-17 19:16:59 i soaked my hands in oil but they’re still red why
2178 2018-01-17 19:16:55 Sitting in English staring at the  charcuterie someone brought for the class. We got Brie we got fig spread and we got toasted baguette slices with olive oil. Wtf is Cleveland
2179 2018-01-17 19:16:49 Why won’t Europe outlaw the use of heavy oil used in fuel for Transatlantic ships. It takes only 16 ships to create more pollution than every car on the planet?

2182 2018-01-17 19:16:13 Actually Canada needs to stop exporting raw resources. Instead turn them into finished products, build factories and oil refineries. Big money and create lots of high paying jobs.
2183 2018-01-17 19:16:11 Foreign oil companies like Shell and Eni run Nigeria not Buhari. Even if Buhari goes another puppet will take his place
2184 2018-01-17 19:16:01 If you ever have this problem again, olive or fish oil can help with constipation, it's overall great for the cat and has tons of nutrients
2185 2018-01-17 19:15:45 Ive managed to slice my finger open with a knife and burn my thumb on hot oil all within 10 mins happy Wednesday 
2186 2018-01-17 19:15:37 Reminds me of taking a car in for an oil change. Go in for the oil change, leave being told your hoses & water pump need replacement.
2187 2018-01-17 19:15:37 【add oil】

[慣用句](香港やその他中華英語圏)
1.頑張れ

同じ意味を持つ中国語の慣用句「加油(jia you)」からの借用語。直訳ですね。「油を加える」→「頑張れ」。

例 Add oil lor. I'll support you. 頑張れ。応援するよ。
2188 2018-01-17 19:15:36 real thought i just had: what if i put chocolate milk in my oil diffuser
2189 2018-01-17 19:15:30 I’m the only fag I know who can change a tire + oil!! My dad taught me to be MASC!!
2190 2018-01-17 19:15:29 @sad_farm got me essential oil mixes as a gift. I am now earthy hoe
2191 2018-01-17 19:15:28 So I just got this new coconut oil face scrub and I'm excited every day to go home and clean my face because it makes my skin SO PERFECT I LOVE COCONUT OIL SO MUCH
2192 2018-01-17 19:15:16 DYK that you get roughly 220 litres of canola oil from a patch of canola the size of a hockey rink?  The kids on @aitcmb Amazing Ag Race @MBAgDays now know that!   #ageducation #agdays2018
2193 2018-01-17 19:15:05 We’re not talking about blunt wraps though, we’re talking about Tobacco leaves. Big diff. Backwoods only adds like a taste oil or something. So at most, 2 chemicals compared to smoking rat poison and 4,000 other thangs
2194 2018-01-17 19:15:03 #ketodiet tip: I find that water can get boring after a while, I add a drop or two of spearmint oil. It gives it a refreshing flavor and the oil is really good for digestion and inflammation!! Dont add too much, though, a little goes a long way! 1-2 drops per 12 oz is perfect.
2195 2018-01-17 19:14:22 Ummm this is pretty much a "DUH" moment. I love when @realDonaldTrump just speaks the truth. Ever figure he has access to things we don't. People act like its such a surprise that #Russia & #China are supplying #NorthKorea with oil and food. It would be news they weren't.
2196 2018-01-17 19:14:16 In your hypocritic use of modern technology despite your hatred of resource acquisition, I'm  sure you are as cavalier with your trendy opposition to mining for lithium, copper, and other resources that are far more ecologically damaging than oil production.
2197 2018-01-17 19:14:10 Maybe the case but Shorting needs an overwhelming majority to work, if you try it like a lone ranger it burns like hot oil
2198 2018-01-17 19:14:06 One time was at a @LandOLakesKtchn MBA presentation. Had a new product. Olive oil and butter frozen together. Toss it in the pan. I was like ‘is this really so hard?’ But fuck, I bet it sells. People like easy.
2199 2018-01-17 19:14:04 trump was chosen by majority. all white people like him. he is working for them. he is just doing openly and with insult, what others were doing quietly.

2207 2018-01-17 19:12:41 Trump wants to open up the ocean to off shore drilling. How long before this, oil spills, happens in our oceans and off the coast of our beaches?
2208 2018-01-17 19:12:34 that looks like fun! Me and my old roomate did choclate syrup in one of those. Oil must of been easier to clean up.

2212 2018-01-17 19:11:57 @RanaForoohar 80% of wealth sits within 10% of firms in US with most firms in Calif. The network effects enables them to consume more power..PII is the oil of these firms. Regulators need to address outdated anti-trust regulations.Big tech CEOs are not responding to critics.#IG2
2213 2018-01-17 19:11:40 I am baffled why some people r ok with OTHER COUNTRIES destroying their environments so Americans can have oil & gas, but are so concerned a/b destroying their own environment. Like advocating for tortured animals, but are ok w/killing BABIES! Hard to understand the differences!
2214 2018-01-17 19:11:36 Hopefully you'll be able to get some good CBD oil for your knuckles at that point...
2215 2018-01-17 19:11:30 Coconut oil (refined if you don't want the coconut scent). I store it in the fridge in summer so it isn't liquid. Shea Butter is also amazing

IE brexit/Trump.

2218 2018-01-17 19:11:13 Feel like swallowing 6 spoons of warm oil with ham and pineapple.
2219 2018-01-17 19:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza for lunch today will be: chewy crust with stale coconut oil and Italian sausage.
2220 2018-01-17 19:11:02 CBD oil is what you need.  I have scleroderma and discovered it's about the only thing that takes away the nerve pain.
2221 2018-01-17 19:11:01 Oil money Vs. Our own money
2222 2018-01-17 19:11:00 I swear these folks don't understand that I got to do what I got to do when I got to do it. my truck only gets 8 to 10. I don't think they have a clue just cuz it is to me, don't mean it's new and s***, need a oil pump an a clutch kit. Father God forgive me for this dirt. S***
2223 2018-01-17 19:10:58 Wouldn't they be likely to use veg oil because it's cheaper? (I understand wanting to know and not assume tho.)
2224 2018-01-17 19:10:56 We thought my wife would only find some temp work (she's a PT) which turned into a 5 year contract!
Put out feelers. There's work up here. Oil up north and things like working on the ferry boats and in the tourist shops during the summer.
Make it happen!
I followed you.

2227 2018-01-17 19:10:37 マテウス、あのおねーさんよくね？
2228 2018-01-17 19:10:30 Carlo in talks coming back in the summer! #AgentTalk #TransferNews
2229 2018-01-17 19:10:19 全ての油という油に感謝しているよ。
2230 2018-01-17 19:10:01 For those following the thrilling tale of my heating system, the oil has arrived, you can all stand down.
2231 2018-01-17 19:09:28 Presently she poured oil on and the comb and ask her teeth with spite; then you must tie a forest sprang up, such an awfully
2232 2018-01-17 19:09:23 Naturalistas, good everyday oil/moisturizer for the hair...? Ready, set, go! #naturalhair #naturalista #NaturalHairTwitter #kinks #coils
2233 2018-01-17 19:09:05  I don't even need the oil!
2234 2018-01-17 19:09:05 امين يارب العالمين
تسلم وتفرح بحبايبك يارب
2235 2018-01-17 19:08:55 Our data is oil, our data is the most valuable commodity we have #iq2debate @RanaForoohar
2236 2018-01-17 19:08:50 @ChelseaFC @CesarAzpi Great to see your Captain tonight should be permanent! ComeOnChelsea #Cesar4Captain #CFCFamily #KTBFFH
2237 2018-01-17 19:08:45 Here comes the oversight function of the Senate Public account Committee . now we know the principle of government entities in the oil sector incurred expenditures without the approval of the legislature
2238 2018-01-17 19:08:45 Rana Forhoohar: "The way society thinks about antitrust is totally outdated today. We're living in a digital world now, where data is as valuable as oil. But regulators haven't taken on this issue" #iq2debate
2239 2018-01-17 19:08:41 Finally copped that eco olive oil alcohol free gel for my baby hairs 
2240 2018-01-17 19:08:34 Doing my oil change now
2241 2018-01-17 19:08:29 OIL DIFF: 5.53 -> 5.53
2242 2018-01-17 19:07:55 Having been to a dozen African countries, postcolonialism hasn't been too kind to those lands. Enter the oil and diamond companies, who've managed to pollute and loot, while stirring up wars enabled by greedy warlords. However, the monsters in charge are of European extraction.
2243 2018-01-17 19:07:51 I think it may have been when Hiller was trying to come back from vertigo a couple of yrs back.
2244 2018-01-17 19:07:39 OIL DIFF: 5.49 -> 5.56
2245 2018-01-17 19:07:25 Itzel is talking shit about oil diffusers on my timeline and I won’t stand for that slander on my feed just because she has no taste when it comes to aromatherapy
2246 2018-01-17 19:07:14 Bill Clinton did not send troops to Iraq based on lies. I am sure that the failings of "Right Wing" administrations are blamed on the left even when the left did not send the troops. And lets not forget the "Rights" Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib abuses. No oil in Nth Korea or Rwanda.
2247 2018-01-17 19:07:00 EPIC grape juice olive oil victorias secret perfume i die uhnf he make me a stuffed animals.
2248 2018-01-17 19:06:59 ultra repair cream by first aid beauty or one of my fav things to do is dilute jojoba oil with a lil water and put a shit ton on my hands with gloves before i go to sleep
2249 2018-01-17 19:06:57 Damn this beautiful! Like oil on canvas 
2250 2018-01-17 19:06:48 Did you know #oliveoil has a higher smoke point than the average cooking temperature? That means you can cook with your favorite Pompeian #EVOO without losing any of the olive oil's healthy benefits! #CookingTip
2251 2018-01-17 19:06:32 @bittenwritten hi Zeren hope you are well was wondering if you got my invite to the Olive Oil gala dinner on 23 Jan at Osteria Dell'Angolo Westminster  would be great to see you, looking forward to your reply, thank you, Luisa Welch
2252 2018-01-17 19:06:31 that and jojoba oil
2253 2018-01-17 19:06:19 I want a wax pen or an oil pen so bad. I feel like that would help me in so many situations.
2254 2018-01-17 19:06:16 @realDonaldTrump Well Done Sir North Korea  would not be talking to South Korea  in such good well if it was not for your strong stance#WorldPeace
2255 2018-01-17 19:06:13 I’ve been listening rumors of oil tankers since August, but unfortunately, so far...
2256 2018-01-17 19:06:10 スロ茶々は最高だぞ
2257 2018-01-17 19:06:07 I gave you links proving otherwise. Why do you deny them. All the oil is usable although some aren't as versatile as others.
2258 2018-01-17 19:06:00 Castor oil mixed with coconut oil.....the best
2259 2018-01-17 19:05:58 This one is advertising beard oil to me. It's like eye is paining her. She can't see that my beard don connect already or what
2260 2018-01-17 19:05:42 @ChannonRose Use coconut oil for your lips. In my experience, ANY kind of chapstick makes lips drier.
2261 2018-01-17 19:05:38 Yep. They’ve sold their soul to oil and Russian money I’ve heard. What a worthless club.
2262 2018-01-17 19:05:36 My first car, a 1978 metallic blue. Used more oil than fuel.
2263 2018-01-17 19:05:08 Show me a victim & oil show you a Liberal
2264 2018-01-17 19:05:07 Finally outside of the house. Ordered my coffee from Starbucks and now I’m sitting at BaleChevrolet having an oil change accomplished.
2265 2018-01-17 19:05:04 If the warm oil tastes like pizza, I'm probably up for that too!
2266 2018-01-17 19:05:01 Trump to libs is exactly what Sanders would be to conservatives. Imagine 10% increase in income taxes. No border. Amnesty for all. Mass immigration. Shutting down oil fields. Single payer healthcare. Free college. No guns. Yep. That’s what we will have in 2021. Wake up, folks!
2267 2018-01-17 19:04:59 *hands you the oil*
2268 2018-01-17 19:04:49 <<doting Minnesota mom voice>> “Oh, hogwash!”  

In any case, it’s better to be a snake oil salesman than a snake oil consumer haha
2269 2018-01-17 19:04:43 @JamesSteen100 Hi James, hope you are well. I have a gala dinner coming up for a EU promotion of extra virgin olive oil on 23 Jan and was wondering if you and Louise might like to come along Osteria Dell'Angolo Westminster. Just in case you are free..... many thanks Luisa
2270 2018-01-17 19:04:31 Take a moment and check out the new POLO Waxy Oil Gen...
2271 2018-01-17 19:04:28 Going by the details from the link, it shows a lot is wrong and several fraud has been Perpetrated in the oil sector which Nigerians are paying hardly for this fraud.

It's wholesomely believe that the Senate under your watch will not hesitate to put proper legislation in place.
2272 2018-01-17 19:04:08 Baked potato with cheese and beans!
2273 2018-01-17 19:04:06 Oil And ooze!
2274 2018-01-17 19:03:56 Leadbelcher base. Layer Ironbreaker. Wash with Nuln oil. Edge highlight with Stormhost Silver. I havent done any highlights in this pic though. This is my min tabletop standard to use the minis in a game.
2275 2018-01-17 19:03:41 It’s not any less fattening. Olive oil just has healthy fat in it, but it’s calorie dense nonetheless. Sad but tru

2277 2018-01-17 19:03:20 ... #LiberalLogic when people ?ed Hillary’s health CNN called people to task for talking bout it. Its like the don’t even try hide their #LiberalHypocrisy anymore. Facts & ethics are like oil n water to Dems. #LiberalLunacy at its best.
2278 2018-01-17 19:03:16 Was at My Mother's stand getting Cocoa butter Lotion rubbed on My Back AND then I Seen some Olive Oil Lotion... Pressing the container... press press #ThisSmellGood 

Bless YOU #Jesus
2279 2018-01-17 19:03:01 I didn’t wanna put too much on his plate so soon, so I asked him to just show me how to change my oil so I don’t have to bother him to do it.
2280 2018-01-17 19:02:58 lol I do this with tortilla chips. I just stopped eating fritos, and when I had a handful again it was like WOAH HEY HI, OIL AND SALT. You gotta keep up with intense stuff or I lose the taste for it

2285 2018-01-17 19:02:39 Setswana: #bata is bath tub and again, to beat as in betsa. 

I forgot the third meaning which is taking porridge and dip it on some oil or relish so that relish doesn't get finished fast!
2286 2018-01-17 19:02:19 That's just what big oil wants you to think.
2287 2018-01-17 19:02:18 @sulineats HI Su-Lin, not sure if you received my invite to the Olive Oil gala dinner on 23 Jan at Osteria dell'Angolo Westminster  emailed a couple of weeks agto? would be lovely to see you. Please let me know if I need to resend. Many thanks. Luisa Welch
2288 2018-01-17 19:01:54 Just think - if people like Stelmach didn't sell us out, we might not have had to start from scratch. At least we know now that oil won't direct us moving forward.
2289 2018-01-17 19:01:49 Legal weed..medical marijuana...two different things?  Jeff Sessions is trying to insert government rules on medical marijuana. Dravets Syndrome is just one condition which is curbed by cannibus oil.  It is a lifesaving medicine.
2290 2018-01-17 19:01:46 I only use eco styler on wet hair, otherwise it gets nasty. sealing it with a good oil after/once it dries helps to remove the crunch. I would try deva curl supercream too. great hold without a crunch. I also do my hair at night & diffuse it or let it air dry like on a sunday
2291 2018-01-17 19:01:41 I love seeing black excellence down my TL due rags, fros, curls, melanin, cocoanut oil and all that!!
2292 2018-01-17 19:01:30 Coconut oil can help cure yeast infection easily.
Coconut oil forms a non-irritating protective layer on the affected skin area.
2293 2018-01-17 19:01:28 I ran out of Coco nut oil!!!! I’m INCOMPLETE. 
2294 2018-01-17 19:01:19 i love coconut oil so much like its so good for hair, skin and its one of the best methods to detox your body
2295 2018-01-17 19:01:16 Well shit
What if its got cannabis oil
2296 2018-01-17 19:01:15 Petrol at Rs. 71/ litre pinches! 
Global crude oil prices notwithstanding.
2297 2018-01-17 19:01:08 more Iran sanctions would push oil over 100USD , KSA retarded policy, ANnunakis, the krakken ....
2298 2018-01-17 19:01:07 #ICEcountry, just a heads up that the ICE Gear Store at Western Financial Place will be closed from 8:30 a.m. to 12 p.m. on Friday, January 19.

It will reopen at 1 p.m. that day ahead of our game against the Edmonton Oil Kings.
2299 2018-01-17 19:01:06 Ah a literalist...  a scenario just for you. You need to carry dangerous gear, and you need snake oil for your arthritis. Tada.
2300 2018-01-17 19:01:05 Someone talk to me while my oil is getting changed
2301 2018-01-17 19:01:02 If we start covering seals in a little bit of oil now we might be able to help them evolve and adapt to it before we really start to fuck things up in like 2 yearswhen the ocean is 85% fossil fuel
2302 2018-01-17 19:00:57 Our go to’s are greek yogurt for Mayo or applesauce for butter or oil! #ProgressNotPerfection
2303 2018-01-17 19:00:47 shaved my legs today. it only took 40 mins. fuck coconut oil.
2304 2018-01-17 19:00:45 In class talking about money and the oil fields get brought up and the teacher asks if any of us know people in the fields  I raise my hand and said my boyfriend and a few good guy friends are currently...never have I gotten a dirtier look from a random girl#SorryNotSorry
2305 2018-01-17 19:00:44 @BillNye I like Science but I find it sad how #science has been the root of so many problems.  #pod #Oil etc

2309 2018-01-17 19:00:16 Because Zinke is busy opening up special territories to mining and oil industries. Short sighted, shameful.
2310 2018-01-17 19:00:16 It's killing me oil was 40 6 months ago
2311 2018-01-17 19:00:16 @jellymalin hi Angelica not sure if you got my invite to the Olive Oil Gala Dinner  on 23 Jan at Osteria Dell'Angolo, Westminster, did not get a reply, & it would be lovely to see you.Looking forward to hearing from you. can resend invite if you didn't get it. Luisa Welch
2312 2018-01-17 19:00:06 Did you know that some castor oils have been washed with hexane? Not St. Francis Castor Oil. It's organic & comes in a dark glass bottle.
2313 2018-01-17 19:00:04 okay my mum just brought this numbing oil for my tooth and i put it on my gum and then read it and it said avoid putting on gums! we love pain

2315 2018-01-17 18:59:53 @BBCScotlandNews You spend 20 seconds mentioning @ScottishEPA withholding the removal of 3 oil rigs (destined for foreign scrapyards) from Scottish waters as part of diligent environmental controls then 2 minutes on a swimming hedgehog  Informed/ balanced reporting?
2316 2018-01-17 18:59:48 City fans actually talking about #mufc & money is hilarious! Without 1.3billion in oil  you wouldn't even been relevant!! 
2317 2018-01-17 18:59:30 My oil infusion machine came in from @LEVOoil! I'm so excited!

2322 2018-01-17 18:58:35 Why are we not hearing about the big oil spills anymore.  Does any one know if they stopped it. Off coast of China.
2323 2018-01-17 18:58:33 Trump is a thief and a grifter, there's always another scam just around the corner. Once they've stopped the traffic to the parks with outrageous fees, he'll sell the national park land to his Russian & Saudi oil & mineral investors, for a hefty percentage of the profits.
2324 2018-01-17 18:58:32 All the facts known Global Countries Government's,  every scientific research database in hands of various departments of every Government departments offices, the oil, gas , electricity,  fossils,  Chemical Industrial Complexes, Development under them.
They acts or civilians?
2325 2018-01-17 18:58:28 The left also quote other countries as better but ignore differences in population, economies and geography. Norway less people than London, oil, high taxes cannot compare with UK
2326 2018-01-17 18:58:27 @maya_orr Dear Maya, how are you? Miss  you very much. Would you be able to join us at the Olive Oil Gala Dinner on 23 Jan at Osteria Dell'angolo Westminster, lovely event, would love to reciprocate your ever wonderful hospitality. thank you Luisa Welch
2327 2018-01-17 18:58:24 I'm dying this from the oil Barons
2328 2018-01-17 18:58:23 I never expected oil to run up this much in winter looks like it going to 70 if not 75
2329 2018-01-17 18:58:14 Hello Hydration shampoo. Then I use ORS Monoi oil leave in
2330 2018-01-17 18:58:05 God forbid we delay something that rich oil companies want done. But when it comes to something that Ohio voter want done you ignore us. Why don't you comment about Trump's racism? Why don't you comment about Trump paying off pornstars? You are the biggest mistake Ohio ever made.
2331 2018-01-17 18:58:02 Hi Diane,Rough Cut An Onion,Place Small piles For Each Burger,In a Cast Iron Pan,Pour A little Olive Oil On the Onions,Place Burger on Top 8 mins low flame
2332 2018-01-17 18:57:57 Tea tree face oil from body shop is so good for that 
2333 2018-01-17 18:57:54 You have to wait 15 years on dear, when the oil is depleted then they are done. Honestly I have given up on any surprises, these guys are bold, have no morals or shame and they are not retreating as long as they have power. Only death can surprise them,sorry to say!
2334 2018-01-17 18:57:44 @pvtimes Water Rights , This Sounds Like " Chinatown " Taking Water From Mono Lake In Calif. , Worth More Than Oil. This Stinks !!!
2335 2018-01-17 18:57:38 Hmm, reminds me a lot of Architect Matti Suuronen’s Venturo (and Futuro) modular structures/houses, also made of GRP at that era. Oil Crisis killed the business though: the material costs sky rocketed.
2336 2018-01-17 18:57:30 One of the things I miss about my childhood is seeing all seven of my grandmother's cats flopped around the oil furnace in the dining room. Melty happy cats are so good.
2337 2018-01-17 18:57:11 something i recommend if u cant get a prescription 1) cvs psoriasis oil if they still have it or any oil- leave it on for a few hours or overnight w a shower cap. 2) leave tgel on for 45min before shower. do these several times a week. also heard vit D & omega3 helps
2338 2018-01-17 18:57:00 You are right. Many thought it will be impossible to move #Warri from her over dependence on oil to anything else, let alone tech. But today we're seeing that the people of Warri are gradually embracing tech.

2341 2018-01-17 18:56:43 a coworker made me an essential oil diffuser bracelet. she thought it was something I would appreciate so she sat down & MADE me a freaking adorable bracelet. it's the little things y'all :'-)

2345 2018-01-17 18:56:27 Sharp rebound in oil...up nearly 1% (60 cents) on the lows earlier in the day. Heard one analyst today say average for 2018 sub $60 for Brent. Doesn't seem right. You can quote me at above $70 for average this year...
2346 2018-01-17 18:56:13 I wish Micciche was as concerned about the oil tax credits and deductions as he is about the increasing costs of private healthcare. #akleg
2347 2018-01-17 18:56:10 I'm making lunch with coconut oil and I can feel skin improving already
2348 2018-01-17 18:56:03 thank you...the inspiration for these sketches comes comes two wonderful and enchanting woodland places Savernake Forest and Leith Hill sadly the latter under threat from a total inappropriate oil drilling development.
2349 2018-01-17 18:55:57 Yo, pass the warm oil with mushroom please
2350 2018-01-17 18:55:44 The NSA should be dismantled! If we (republicans and democrats) really want to END the threat of terrorism we should END OIL, that'll quiet the middle east right down! Spend the Intel budget on tech for energy... but Americans drink to much!!!
2351 2018-01-17 18:55:44 My shorty asked what I need from the store. Grab some baby oil so I can rub that shit in

2354 2018-01-17 18:55:28 Next they will be adding McT oil and calling it a weight loss aid
2355 2018-01-17 18:55:28 Man-sh!tty complaining about #Sanchez going to #MUFC for money just shows that even with oil money you'll never be significant! You think players go to #mcfc because of your 2 measly titles and the emptyhad??! Only thing going for you was money, and United STILL beat you at that!
2356 2018-01-17 18:55:19 Same. Luckily this wasn't actual food, just a LOT of oil and grease.  But easy to clean off, thankfully.

Okay this is so stupid and embarrassing, but I'm going to share my experience with you all so you don't make the same mistake. A couple years ago I got really into using essential oils. I love the way they smell, I love dif…
2358 2018-01-17 18:55:13 Eish I use Tresemme Shampoo to wash it, Condition it with a drop of coconut oil, leave it to soak into the hair for 30minutes, wash it out and let it hair dry, use a heat protector and flat iron it then apply a Pantene serum, brush it in and then ready to wear!

2375 2018-01-17 18:52:29 She’s so cute  

also I’m assuming that the white collar is a flea collar but in my experience those aren’t effective try Cedarwood oil it’s a natural repellent against ticks/fleas and it’s like $5 for a bottle and you only need a few drops.
2376 2018-01-17 18:52:12 Thank you My Girl Paulette for delivering lunch to some very special customers at Heathwood Oil.  You just can't go wrong with a great burger!  @brgrkitchen

2382 2018-01-17 18:51:22 Trade sanctions against the country cause a lot of harm for one. They leaned hard on oil revenues and when the price fell, so did everything else - the same happened in Alberta which was run by right-wing governments for 50 years. We just have th ability to borrow

2387 2018-01-17 18:51:05 Did you guys know you could make cake with a can of soda instead of adding eggs and vegetable oil!
2388 2018-01-17 18:51:03 ダイエットしていたって、時にはオイルも必要だろう?
2389 2018-01-17 18:50:51 ive been rewatching the two scenes where jin thought he accidently put fish oil in his dish & when hoseok almost put corn syrup in his and its just.. so funny their faces KILL Me
2390 2018-01-17 18:50:45 who even cooks broccoli with oil
2391 2018-01-17 18:50:29 I have difficulty calling a cooked mixture of fat/oil and flour a roux if it hasn't been browned at all. Sadly, there's no term more interesting in lieu (lieux?) of 'white roux.' We may as well say we're making our sandwich on 'unbrowned toast.'
2392 2018-01-17 18:50:28 Big money in oil and gas. Not a bit surprised.
2393 2018-01-17 18:50:24 @MelogranoDeli Hello not sure if you received my invite as it was sent to Piccola deli re Olive Oil gala dinner on 23 Jan at Osteria Dell'Angolo Westminster. would you be able to join us? thank you. Luisa Welch

2395 2018-01-17 18:50:20 Olive oil takes weeks  go to the Dr and ask them to syringe it, as long as your ear drum is visible (so as long as it's not infected/bulging and it's just wax build up) they will do it. You can pay to have it done privately, it's about £60 I think.

2398 2018-01-17 18:50:07 in class today my teacher was talking about what can be made from crude oil “gasoline, kerosine...” strike a match, ignite the scene?
2399 2018-01-17 18:50:01 Getting My baby a oil change remind you I haven’t had one in hella long
2400 2018-01-17 18:50:01 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
2401 2018-01-17 18:49:48 $15 an hour can get you a house in Ca, Ny & Ill? Cut gov by elimination of useless agencies & put the dollar on gold, silver, oil & other commodities. Then cut taxes & repeal the fed & state income tax & property tax. 
Radical yes yet better than socialism
2402 2018-01-17 18:49:46 Confused. She wants to protect our oil? To be used later or just know it’s there? Contrary statement. 
There are big health risks.
We need new technology.
It’s not right that we ask other countries to risk on our behalf. We just need safer ways.

Use our own oil, coal and gas!
2403 2018-01-17 18:49:44 apparently you don't believe that national parks pristine land should be preserved for generations to come ....you would rather live in a land where an oil derrick is outside your window

2405 2018-01-17 18:49:33 Mix castor oil in your conditioner & shampoo I stick to shea moisture it has done wonders to my hair
2406 2018-01-17 18:49:31 That stuff is pretty amazing but you can use olive oil or mayo if you don’t want to pick up a bottle. Olive oil works quickly and mayo takes a soak but works better than oo.
2407 2018-01-17 18:49:13 Sorry you don’t like reality. Who blows up hospitals and closed hospital beds because oil market falls flat? Oh right, Conservative Govt’s. This is written in Ab history books now. Nothing will change that, not even idiots like you.
2408 2018-01-17 18:49:12 I am not saying marijuana is the same as heroin; what I am saying is that there are unscrupulous snake oil salesman selling it as the end all cure all w/ zero consequences as was case w early 20th century elixirs. Border security will help curve heroin availability.

2413 2018-01-17 18:48:29 You don’t get it, do you. This is now. Those are later. You have basically five months to come up with five billion dollars. You can’t wait for multi-year oil or mining projects.
2414 2018-01-17 18:48:24 So tempted to try castor oil if baby girl doesn’t come by her due date as long as my OB says it’s okay
2415 2018-01-17 18:48:15 Scary. Retail investors more confused than ever. Snake oil salesmen reinventing their pitches. I say hold the faith, SA inc will come back. What’s the most appropriate BMK for a general equity fund KEITH? Capped SWIX?
2416 2018-01-17 18:47:54 The black pits oil field. Cast a fireball at one of the monsters forgetting there was oil everywhere. Killed everyone though including all of my team.
2417 2018-01-17 18:47:52 Local chip shop fries in palm oil, I recently discovered. That's them boycotted.
2418 2018-01-17 18:47:43 I need a q of oil to the dome
2419 2018-01-17 18:47:33 good idea. I do have eucalyptus oil at home.
2420 2018-01-17 18:47:32 That’s better option than AndyCarroll
2421 2018-01-17 18:47:20 Atleast this proffers an head way to the problems in our oil sector, the inability of the @NNPCgroup to meet the needs of Nigerians is still alarming.
2422 2018-01-17 18:47:17 Put Hydrogen Peroxide on a tissue and drip it in your ear then take a warm shower and let the water go inside your ear canal. If all else fail drip some Olive oil into you ear canal to soften the wax then repeat the warm water shower.
2423 2018-01-17 18:47:14 Laughing because NCR would still be blue. Imma guess the bright boy who drew this knowns nothing about CA or they are drawing it for military and farmland reasons and not political, though you’d want LA for the oil...  I love how this came outta nowhere.
2424 2018-01-17 18:47:08 LOL. @kevinmgriffith drives a car and puts gas from oil companies (who may want to drill offshore Florida) into that car. His opposition to oil drilling can’t be trusted! (See how silly that is?).
2425 2018-01-17 18:46:56 Limited Slip Gear Oil in a paint shaker makes a terrific milkshake.
2426 2018-01-17 18:46:55 If you are dehydrating anyway, thin slice the potatoes and dehydrate them as well.  No frying in oil and potato chips are tasty and healthy.  Half the trays for jalapen~os and half for potatoes.
2427 2018-01-17 18:46:54 $PBR hit $12, as predicted. I'm not selling the mother-in-law or mortgaging everything I have, like the $BTC folks, but accumulating with a pt of $15.The $USO uptrend has helped oil stocks. weak $UUP has helped $EEM stocks.

2430 2018-01-17 18:46:45 Don't know about kashrut but lodge comes preseasoned now. If you have to re season it isn't hard. Veg oil, low oven 200, turn upside down on rack with tray below for couple hours.
2431 2018-01-17 18:46:31 It does, especially when we hear they’re going to open up to oil drilling. Hopefully when Muller investigation complete, they will all be gone
2432 2018-01-17 18:46:27 Changed my diet. Drank more water. Coconut oil. Natural face masks. Natural soap. 
2433 2018-01-17 18:46:19 3hrs for an oil change and and one tire and nobody in here but me...........
2434 2018-01-17 18:46:10 Yeah you would need to find out what oil was used. If it was something none kosher it would require libbun.
2435 2018-01-17 18:46:10 To your point on the oil. None. I should have phrased that better. Apologies. It's not the oil itself, but rather the international petrodollar system that we were going after to protect. We switched Iraq back over to $4Oil the moment we invaded.

2439 2018-01-17 18:45:35 Who said anything about oil having the potential for expansion? Potential does NOT make it a guarantee... Again more hypothetical.....
2440 2018-01-17 18:45:34 Do these people not realize that Olive oil is good for you and your skin? SMH.
2441 2018-01-17 18:45:24 The American Oligarchs want to treat the entire nation like the oil companies treated Louisiana's wetlands during the 1920s.
2442 2018-01-17 18:45:10 Very True! Plus the good part about renewables is they can expand for a long time, infinitely more jobs to be had when solar and wind are taking off while oil and gas are losing out. #ClimateChangeIsReal
2443 2018-01-17 18:45:07 Venezuelan oil production is at 1989 levels
2444 2018-01-17 18:45:05 You know you’re adulting when you schedule your own oil change and tire rotation to correspond with your off days
2445 2018-01-17 18:45:00 I have very close family & many friends in the oil & gas industry. The global aspect of the industry is vital & that is why international travel should be geared to Scotland's needs not Tory xenophobia!

2447 2018-01-17 18:44:47 I liked the oil drop
2448 2018-01-17 18:44:40 Zinke doesn’t have a reason to meet with them since his goal is to destroy the national parks so the rich corporations can dig for oil and minerals to enrich themselves.
2449 2018-01-17 18:44:35 Post should discuss welfare to corporate welfare queens is trillions of dollars a year - more than is spent on Military, Social Security each year.  Queens - banks, oil, coal, cable, prescription drugs, electricity, etc.  2002 Post Peter Arno Paying Twice for the Same Drugs

2451 2018-01-17 18:44:31 Apparently it's to squeeze warm water in to your ear at some stage . Might use it to oil the bike chain
2452 2018-01-17 18:44:22 We might have but don't remember
2453 2018-01-17 18:44:11 I use cinnamon now, gonna have to try the honey n coconut oil.
2454 2018-01-17 18:44:01 The only people who benefit from this are the oil companies who obtain the extraction rights, and the refineries. WE don't get it for any cheaper.
2455 2018-01-17 18:43:29 I just wanna say shoutout to Jamaican black castor oil!!!!!

2459 2018-01-17 18:43:07 In my opinion the best way to handle the racial term oil is to be as unapologetically black as possible
2460 2018-01-17 18:43:02 That is some serious multigrade oil

2465 2018-01-17 18:42:41 We have no heating. My mistake was checking the level of the oil tank.
2466 2018-01-17 18:42:40 I think I’ll make a vid about it because I was completely bald but biotin & my oil regimen has grown my hair really fast
2467 2018-01-17 18:42:38 Remember "peak oil", the superpower rush to secure for themselves the last remaining crude and tarsands reserves? Iran, Venezuela, Syria, and natural gas and pipeline routes in Ukraine (+ pipeline routes through Afghanistan). Current events are a bit more clear through this lens
2468 2018-01-17 18:42:37 For silky hair, mix 3 parts olive oil and 1 part honey. Put in microwave 30 sec. Apply to damp hair 20 mins with shower cap on. Rinse well!

2471 2018-01-17 18:41:51 Oh boy, took my car in for an oil change and a tire patch, and it turns out it needs hundreds of dollars of other work too. Nice. Good stuff.
2472 2018-01-17 18:41:50 We buy oil on the GLOBAL market, denominated in US Dollars. The price is based on global supply and demand. Did someone tell you that you and I somehow pay LESS for oil that was extracted from our own lands? If they did they are hoodwinking you.
2473 2018-01-17 18:41:49 leí que quieren el dólar entre 45 y 50 y el gas oil a 31...creen en papa noel,en los reyes magos y en el ratón Perez...

2476 2018-01-17 18:41:33 Be very clear this could have happened without the massive tax break to the wealthy, and Obama’s corporate 28 and manufacturing 25 rate (without the 1% theft) was dismantled because Republicans fought taking away the oil giveaway.
2477 2018-01-17 18:41:21 @The_Upcoming Hi there, had no reply to my invite to the Olive Oil Gala Dinner on 23 Jan and was wondering if one of  the people in the team might be coming? Looking forward to hearing from you. Luisa Welch
2478 2018-01-17 18:41:17 Keep the mosquitos away with a few drops of Eucalyptus Oil on your ankles &amp; wrists.
2479 2018-01-17 18:41:06 1. That’s what I asked YOU. Answer my question please.
2. Balls!! Please link me to reports of the bloody battle to gain control of the Omar oil fields from #ISIS and the carnage in the #Khubar valley towns.
#ISISDF
2480 2018-01-17 18:40:58 The GOP doesn't want us to have jobs, they want a malleable and large pool of poor people who want the coal and oil jobs to come back so they can keep their donors and cronies rich a little longer.
2481 2018-01-17 18:40:49 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
2482 2018-01-17 18:40:22 リーダータバコは体に良くないッスよー？
2483 2018-01-17 18:40:20 The governments continue to subsidize the oil industry.
2484 2018-01-17 18:40:18 My cars oil change is so damn expensive whyyyyyyyyy
2485 2018-01-17 18:40:11 Without the Bureau of Land Management's #cutmethane waste rule, oil & gas companies will continue wasting $330 million dollars of taxpayer-owned gas each year. Taxpayers and hard-working families deserve better.
2486 2018-01-17 18:40:10 Yes! Baked chicken parm instead of cooked in oil is so much healthier #ProgressNotPerfection

2497 2018-01-17 18:39:06 I’d check with Lodge on what they use to season. I’ve aleays seasoned my own with vegetable oil.
2498 2018-01-17 18:38:57 They have reduced glycerin and dont contain palm oil as their Base so you don't get so much of the squeaky clean feeling from them. Needless to say I have tried samples of these and not totally convinced IMO. Liquid format smells stronger and longer a longer.

2501 2018-01-17 18:38:40 Politicians in Ghana who are voted for as Members of Parliament (MPs) feels occupying such position is as a result of their hard work for 'a party'. They fraudulently work with party leaders buying them rice and oil etc to the detriment of their constituents.
2502 2018-01-17 18:38:39 Long oil trade starting to look over crowded, but the trend is your friend till it bends at the end

2508 2018-01-17 18:37:53 As in eh.. From pot hole to oil well
2509 2018-01-17 18:37:36 I’ve only read the first page, running for the Holy Oil from the Divine Mercy Shrine, to do the first prayer, but will be having a good look at it later. What do you think of it so far?
2510 2018-01-17 18:37:34 Ok apparently it’s baby oil and I’m allergic to baby oil ? Good to know

Klaus breathed in deeply, searching for her smell...and eventually his werewolf senses got her scent. She wasn't in the house anymore.

2525 2018-01-17 18:35:54 Oil fields? Yemen has larger reserves, even Ecuador has more than twice the total of known reserves as Syria. In terms of production, Cuba produced more. Stop spreading nonsense.
2526 2018-01-17 18:35:51 I respectfully disagree, and note the abundant evidence. Congestion pricing works to reduce oil use. So does infill, transit-oriented development and investment in walkable/bikeable cities. As proof, I offer all the cities that have done this.
2527 2018-01-17 18:35:37 Gupta is a "doctor" the same way Bill Nye is a "scientist."  Snake oil salesmen. Charlatans.

Bernie does not start from a position of compromise.
"What suffering"?  Are you serious?

2534 2018-01-17 18:35:03 It's a pet thing, they just want to think they're looking after the Scots, that only works if the place is broken, otherwise they don't feel needed?

Nah.
It's the oil.
2535 2018-01-17 18:35:00 My olive oil level is pouring olive oil directly from the bottle except the bottle was actually already refilled 10 times with costco’s olive oil jug

2545 2018-01-17 18:33:55 Tip Tuesday!!
It’s flu season, folks. Please take care of yourselves. Wash your hands, and avoid people who are coughing and sneezing. If you happen to fall ill, and you need a holistic remedy for congestion, look no further than rosemary oil.

2549 2018-01-17 18:33:29 Venezuela leaders started off in the 1990s not by saying “we want to be Venezuela” but by saying we are starting a new brand of socialism - taking from the rich oil companies to begin with... Sounds a lot like Bernie... Venezuela has ended up as shithole Venezuela. So no 2 bernie
2550 2018-01-17 18:33:29 Coconut oil  is a life saver 
2551 2018-01-17 18:33:24 Ok, I'm going to do a little thread of my favourite things to have:

1. Stir fry - I love noodles! Get a load of mixed veggies and fry them off with a bit of soy, garlic, ginger, chilli and sesame oil. I use straight to wok rice noodles or the ones that take 2mins in hot water
2552 2018-01-17 18:33:04 one time i left a bottle of olive oil at maria's house so i went back to get it and i found her gently caressing the olive oil while crying
2553 2018-01-17 18:32:55 And a war could give cover to remove sanctions on the Russian oil deal and make them all a lot of money
2554 2018-01-17 18:32:52 I need to wash and get my oil changed  oh & i have a broken nail
2555 2018-01-17 18:32:50 #oil is on the way out as Car Companies push for 50% of products to be #hybrid or all #ElectricVehicles by 2025 #OPEC sees the writing on the wall trying to curb production. But US is producing more oil than ever before!
2556 2018-01-17 18:32:43 I adulted and ordered an olive oil bottle instead of pouring it directly from the actual bottle.
2557 2018-01-17 18:32:32 Take a page from the Joe Don Baker book: Lots and lots of baby oil.
2558 2018-01-17 18:32:29 I use Baby lotion, baby oil gel , my fav bath && body works lotion and a rub on Oil... a spritz of perfume on my pressure points and I'm out  Nothing like smelling good Asf !! I'm undefeated with this

2563 2018-01-17 18:32:14 The ecological impact of crytocurrency is unconscionable. Fuck the faux-progressive, silicon valley turd nuggets who are willing to contribute to the problem because they're getting rich. Just as bad as oil barrens ignore tanker leaks.
2564 2018-01-17 18:32:05 Come on man...don't speak ill of the man who transformed a team that had apparently had nothing but bad contracts and underperforming players on it when he took it over ;). People who won't admit it either can't or simply won't.
2565 2018-01-17 18:32:02 Made the rosemary oil on Monday. Smells good. Going to make tarragon oil and dill and lemon oil.

Also you “1. We are commanded to be good stewards”
Finally - got a reference for oil wells. That’s interesting.
2567 2018-01-17 18:31:50 you're against the oil and gas but you support the largest environmental polluters in the world that use oil and gas, one is ok but the other isn't, hmm
2568 2018-01-17 18:31:27 i just remembered this boy in my class who spent his entire school life telling people he wears this gold necklace bc he swallowed oil when he was a kid ???? fat bitch liar
2569 2018-01-17 18:31:26 my face has been so dry and flaky and i put some coconut oil on and my face is so soft now:)
2570 2018-01-17 18:31:25 Yeah Ive tried all my go to tricks but its bad this time.  I had a refill on an antibiotic so I started taking it yesterday along with ibuprofen 800mgs, the clove oil & oragel and I cant get any relief Its just constant throbbing up my jaw into behind my eye. Ughhh
2571 2018-01-17 18:31:16 And isn’t that a reason good enough to put our elders on a daily cannabis oil dose while they are still not there?
2572 2018-01-17 18:31:00 Tomato, red onion, cucumber, olive oil (Villa Cappelli of course),feta cheese, salt and pepper... As a side salad for dinner.  Thanks so much!
2573 2018-01-17 18:30:42 #WellnessWednesday Sleep better! Put a bit of lavender oil on your pillow. Studies show that the essential oil can improve your sleep quality.
2574 2018-01-17 18:30:40 Banks are always super-quick to raise rates, but very slow to lower them. Just like the oil companies with their gasoline pricing! Hmmmmm

How are you doing today?
2579 2018-01-17 18:29:53 @lussorian for Jamie O'Sullivan, was wondering if you received my invite and if we can expect you to the Olive Oil Gala Dinner on 23 Jan, looking forward to hearing from you. thank  you. Luis  (ps I can resend invite if you didn't receive it first time round)

2583 2018-01-17 18:29:18 Yes. because it mean focus on EU production and phase out of palm oil. this means certified sustainabiliy and focus on sustainability criteria.
2584 2018-01-17 18:29:15 Hmm, they basically just have to stick a pipe in the sand & out comes oil & yet, they are investing in renewable alternatives. I wonder why?

2590 2018-01-17 18:28:23 ไปนอนนนนน
2591 2018-01-17 18:28:07 I like the taste of synthetic 10W60 more than a traditional “high mileage” oil. Even though it costs more.
2592 2018-01-17 18:28:03 @CaptainMarcinRX I have on question, when you have completed a new oil tanker? or you not making it?

2596 2018-01-17 18:27:38 They need to research lavender essential oil as they readily took the Tide Pod challenge. They don't research, period!
2597 2018-01-17 18:27:37 There was an Intercept article recently on indigenous Peruvians occupying horrifically destructive oil infrastructure. Change is coming all over the place.
2598 2018-01-17 18:27:37 I’m a little sad Green Hill, Chemical Plant and Oil Ocean’s act themes aren’t on here but I’m still excited to see the soundtrack finally available for purchase!

2602 2018-01-17 18:26:59 Yeaaa lotion make that shit worst honestly gotta use baby oil or gel .. I miss summer too
2603 2018-01-17 18:26:41 The very same reason when oil goes down the price of gas doesn't, but raise oil and wham.  It called government protected greed.
2604 2018-01-17 18:26:38 castor oil!!!!
2605 2018-01-17 18:26:24 You laugh but they will rationalize it, by saying we're more susceptible to meteorite strikes due to a thinner atmosphere from C02 emissions and other airborne pollution.
2606 2018-01-17 18:26:20 Now we know who to blame for the state of it then. Sell off your nations assets to foreigners - destroy the unions by closing down your industry, waste North Sea oil on mass unemployment, create housing shortage by selling council houses, create skill shortage that needs migrants
2607 2018-01-17 18:26:14 Literally no vegans promote quinoa. I have been vegan for two years and never eaten quinoa. And as an omni you also eat soja, palm oil etc etc. Stop reaching
2608 2018-01-17 18:25:54 Idk man. What's worse is that people here seem to actually like this "food" i think one roll had foie gras, mango puree, truffle oil, and parmesan cheese
2609 2018-01-17 18:25:47 @Lon_Unattached Hi Fiona, hope you are well.I know you are away, are you able to send anyone to the Olive Oil gala dinner on 23 Jan at Osteria Dell'angolo? Many thanks, hope you are having fun!
2610 2018-01-17 18:25:38 I'm sure you know this, as a fellow witch but clove oil. Just avoid the tongue.
2611 2018-01-17 18:25:34 Do you think we are idiots?
Look at international oil price. It's at 3 year high too.
2612 2018-01-17 18:25:07 Also, invest in pure tea tree oil. I dabbed a little on one of those pimples that hurts, but has no head? Y’all know what I’m talking about. The ones that turn into monsters in your face.
2613 2018-01-17 18:25:05 I’m confused as to how the oil being warm makes a difference
2614 2018-01-17 18:25:02 Yeah, oil was not exactly ideal for the coffee table in my living room. The whole house smelled so bad last night, I had to put the painting I started out on the balcony. 
2615 2018-01-17 18:24:46 I need more coconut oil 
2616 2018-01-17 18:24:45 The obsession w/Trump's weight while we're bombing 7 countries, spying on citizens w/o warrants, repealed net neutrality, piping dirty oil & gas through our drinking water reserves,poisoning kids w/lead & ignoring the rigging of the fking Dem primary, is rage inducing.

2620 2018-01-17 18:23:49 The old ladies at my job are so dramatic lol they’re “stressed” so they have their essential oil diffusers on everywhere and have on all their magnetic jewelry on to help circulation AND the fuckin calming music they have on!! I have to pee every 2 minutes bc of it

I did some oil in HS, and liked it, but yeah, I can see it being a real mess to work with. Probably why they all end up with studio's out back :)
But nice first pic!

2640 2018-01-17 18:21:12 Why do so many English Unionists want to keep on subsidising Scotland. We’re going to cost you a fortune. We’ll all go on the dole and you’ll need to keep us in comfort.

Why don’t you just ditch us?

What do you mean “what about the oil”

2642 2018-01-17 18:20:59 Adını sıklıkla duyduğumuz Rockefeller ailesi bilindiği üzere Standard Oil adlı petrol şirketinin sahibiydi. Bu şirket zaman içinde bir monopol haline gelerek petrol sektörünü kontrol eder hale gelmişti. Ancak 1800'lerin sonuna doğru monopoller ABD'de büyük bir mesele haline geldi
2643 2018-01-17 18:20:54 Once the ability to hedge commodity prices in CNY takes off (see oil contract, iron ore, copper, nickel, etc) more will move to CNY as trade currency. The speed of change is already accelerating. No country wants to be held ransom by the USD
2644 2018-01-17 18:20:52 wow my mom put gas and took my car to get an oil change :(
2645 2018-01-17 18:20:46 Something vintage. Like a 70's Jeep or old school BMW but would use like vegetable oil instead of gas. Probably a car that's been passed down in family or friends

2647 2018-01-17 18:20:43 Yep. The Chinese oil companies have a heavy presence in Africa, along with heavy civil eng/infrastructure construction firms.
2648 2018-01-17 18:20:37 I just love when I get an oil change and then the next day all of the oil leaks out of my car 
2649 2018-01-17 18:20:32 Get the Olbas oil out as well mate 
2650 2018-01-17 18:20:31 I want the Tom Ford shimmering body oil 
2651 2018-01-17 18:20:00 No, but they don't seem to be as actively doing the olive oil thing, at least as far as we know.
2652 2018-01-17 18:19:59 Oh my, well, it involves barrels and oil, then a fire arrow fired my me, instead of hitting one of the magisters during my escape off of fort joy, it hit an oil barrel and boom, you can guess what happened next, the fire spread and death was happy that day, whoops lol

2664 2018-01-17 18:19:10 I got this coconut oil mixed with hemp seed oil and its pretty lit. Very light so I like using it in my hair and in my bath water mostly or as an after bath oil. But the hemp oil smells amazing
2665 2018-01-17 18:18:55 Up until recently, I thought Broiling was Deep Frying. Boiling in Oil. Not sure where the R came from in my crazy logic though

2667 2018-01-17 18:18:46 They got rid of a non-compliant state (who they once supported). They created chaos, enabling big oil to get in & causing backlash of terrorism to give our security state something to do. They added bases in the region. & arms industry no doubt made a ton. No entirely a fuck up.

2674 2018-01-17 18:18:06 @worstall Nordic states, Norway enjoys being the 5th or 6th largest exporter of oil in the world.  It is also good being it's neighbors.  Good piece, local social welfare begets tax tolerance.
2675 2018-01-17 18:18:04 Oil companies made money for 150 years without the "if only" explanations for the lack of positive cash flow by tight oil. I have lots of studies showing tight oil areas that break even at < $50 but corporate returns never reflect this. DUCs and NPV are part of the reasons.
2676 2018-01-17 18:17:57 Need to get my hands on some CBD oil.
2677 2018-01-17 18:17:55 Still writing novels I see. Your not from the land of entitlement. These facts you speak of??. Having troubles ingesting? Olive oil should help. (there I go again, always helping)
2678 2018-01-17 18:17:50 I for once in my life just want to go to jiffy lube and get only an oil change.... not all the other extra crap they talk you in to

2681 2018-01-17 18:17:35 More lies. You have put us on out dated coal and destroying our environment with oil drilling. Renewable energy should be our future.

2697 2018-01-17 18:15:48 Hmm. Like India.. Like China.. Oil tanker in East China Sea.. And this here..
2698 2018-01-17 18:15:42 Good clip from this series. I’d also add ghee as a appropriate oil for the pan fry. Some may prefer its flavor as well.
2699 2018-01-17 18:15:41 Yes, but chartering the oil tanker to take all the contributions could be a problem?

2701 2018-01-17 18:15:35 So, a China submarine fired the missile and USA brought the missile down.
I don't know if this is true, but China is trying to get rid of the Petro Dollar to pay for Oil, sort of like Quadafi wanted to do before he was murdered.
2702 2018-01-17 18:15:29 It always finds buyers and here we go again back in 64s. Wonder if Oil will ever see 55s this year

2706 2018-01-17 18:15:11 You're going to have to find a vet that does oil changes.

2734 2018-01-17 18:12:13 His goal is to undermine the parks and reduce attendance so they can sell to big oil, gas, mining, and lumber.
2735 2018-01-17 18:12:10 Congress should take the tax breaks for big oil & use that  for infrastructure!

2763 2018-01-17 18:08:56 The carbon intensity of global power production is decreasing every year. Makes no sense to continue burning oil in cars and pollute the air while waiting for it to be all renewable. Besides, even with 100% coal power EVs are lower carbon than gasoline/oil.

2771 2018-01-17 18:08:05 Poor Venezuela. Sitting on the world's largest oil reserves yet suffering from 2000%+ inflation and people rummaging through garbage for food. Gov't killing guys trying to surrender. But that's what socialism combined with an autocratic regime will do.
2772 2018-01-17 18:07:51 Yeah that chicken looks way to dark. Either the oil is to hot or something is off with the seasoning blend. Chicken should be golden brown not dark
2773 2018-01-17 18:07:41 なんか熱ぶり返してきた……一昨日に熱がほぼ治まったと思ったのに、一気に悪化
2774 2018-01-17 18:07:37 Glen's ST225 in for a blockmod, Alternator, oil filter housing and lambda sensor....
2775 2018-01-17 18:07:25 Just spilled about 100 bucks worth of face oil on my shirt. FML
2776 2018-01-17 18:07:07 Jacob Rothschild and David Rockefeller Where my doe at. you own every central bank, media company, the one world government, all oil spots, funded every war since Napoleon. @davidrockefell @jacobrothschild get at me lol.
2777 2018-01-17 18:07:01 หลังจากนี้ต้องสู้กว่านี้ แค่นี้ท้อไม่ได้เพราะความเป็นจริงในอนาคตกำลังรอทดสอบเราอยู่
2778 2018-01-17 18:06:58 一部小学生内で豹柄のグッズが流行る……(ヒョウガラさんに渡すと見逃してくれるなる説話が生まれたため)
2779 2018-01-17 18:06:55 Any stable oil company in need an experienced petroleum engineer
2780 2018-01-17 18:06:43 Not just here. 
The weather in Russia is worse cold ever recorded. Some parts is -76 degrees. 
They are going to pay in ways they haven't even imagined. He wants ALL the oil/black gold? It's going to cost him more than he could ever imagine.
#ShitholeTrump brand is over!
2781 2018-01-17 18:06:40 Just tried that hemp oil stuff for the first time. Not real sure how I feel about it..
2782 2018-01-17 18:06:35 Mannnn Fuck Brady and his no olive oil eatin ass
2783 2018-01-17 18:06:35 After President Trump annonces his "fake news awards" he should move to "fake medical advice/diagnosis" by doctors on media. This is such an opportunity to expose the snake oil that is peddled everyday.
2784 2018-01-17 18:06:32 Wooo! Today is going to be a hell of a day. Started my day with a dentist appointment, now I'm at the shop getting my oil changed (in my car, I SEE YOU) and then going to the doctor. Oh and I'll make some good shit for y'all later! >:)
2785 2018-01-17 18:06:17 @djpaulyd & ur calves & ur ankles & rub your feet & kiss ur feet & kiss & suck softly on ur balls w/ warm minty breath & jacking u off sloppy w/ massage oil & sit on ur fat dick right before u cum so u can squirt ur semen deep inside my pussy while ur tongue is in my throat 
2786 2018-01-17 18:06:12 Me and Sicily both have some sort of stomach virus. I'm definitely about to try this Apple cider vinegar, peppermint oil, lemon ,ginger,  concoction to fix this shit.
2787 2018-01-17 18:05:59 Lucas Oil probably tastes GR8
2788 2018-01-17 18:05:53 Tambien lo hizo aranguren cuando se autocompro barcos de fuel oil, bullrich con maldonado, nahuel, la represion de la reforma prev, caputo cuando se autocompro bonos, y muchos etc
2789 2018-01-17 18:05:45 One little tip that we did is pick up a bottle of olive oil and balsamic vinegar to carry with us, and grab meat, cheese, tomatoes and bread at the outdoor markets each place we went for an occasional alternative to restaurant dining
2790 2018-01-17 18:05:45 Oil now just shy of $70.  Expect significantly greater oil revenues for 2017/18.
2791 2018-01-17 18:05:43 Lal & I have took Baby Gracie essential oil baths, moisturized her, and gave her foot massages every single day since she was born bc 
2792 2018-01-17 18:05:37 CBN 2 support farmers in productn of tomato, cocoa, oil palm in 2018, says CBN Gov. Godwin Emefiele @ a meeting w/ Agric Minister Audu Ogbeh
2793 2018-01-17 18:05:28 RIP Green Hill, Chemical Plant, Oil Ocean
2794 2018-01-17 18:05:26 เป็นอีกวันที่ผ่านไปแบบแค่ผ่านไป...
2795 2018-01-17 18:05:24 Republicans hold up funding healthcare endangering Americans while treasonously BACKSTABBING military used to secure poppy for big pharma pain pill profits and oil that enriches evil from elsewhere presentl stealing homes futures from locals thanks to #StateDeptTreasons
2796 2018-01-17 18:05:22 雨生龍之介、隠密系のくせに身に付けてるアイテムがあまりにも特徴的過ぎるんだよぉ……！！
2797 2018-01-17 18:05:19 Marijuana is going down same road as snake oil elixirs of the early 20th century. You sound like a logical person but unfortunately many people are not; many are unscrupulous; in my opinion they are creating the problem & urgency for gov to get involved.
2798 2018-01-17 18:05:09 小学生に多大なトラウマを!
2799 2018-01-17 18:05:08 Again, this didn't happen within a year.  I'm pretty sure everything oil went way up under the socialist, US-hating Kenyan, and master persuader Obama.
2800 2018-01-17 18:04:51 They should be able to see where it hit if it caused an earthquake.
2801 2018-01-17 18:04:45 Just had deer sausage w/NY Italian seasoning. Cooked in olive oil w/ onions & garlic. Delicious!
2802 2018-01-17 18:04:44 You're last article about tethers wasn't enough? Youre step by step instructions on high to buy xrp, and xlm at an ath wasn't enough? You had to give credit to a known snake oil salesmen huh? You're research is pathetic and it shines a light on non-crypto related news, ur awful
2803 2018-01-17 18:04:32 なんやかんやで2009年ぐらいに映画化されるやつだ……(テケテケ)
2804 2018-01-17 18:04:29 On another note I went to whole foods after renewing my passport this morning to get more essential oils for my diffuser and my room smells STRONGLY of tea tree oil now and I’m LIviNG!!!
2805 2018-01-17 18:04:26 That was pre oil tanker days. XR 600, so only like a small cargo ship... 
2806 2018-01-17 18:04:23 Omegagentics Mega 10 Fish Oil now in stock

2808 2018-01-17 18:04:01 Girl okay tart! The clay foundation. The sea one isn't for oily skin . I have the Fenty and I like it but I don't love it like I love the tart clay one !!! I have really oil skin too.
2809 2018-01-17 18:03:52 Not until Sanchez and oil leaves arsenal and you replace them with Fabio pistu, John mudingayi and sukuta Paso from France second division
2810 2018-01-17 18:03:46 When the Spirit of God came upon the upper room remnant it was in laughing tongues of fire! The anointing of the Holy Spirit has ALWAYS been the oil of joy!
2811 2018-01-17 18:03:22 How do guys pack n travel with kentaste (coconut oil) without it melting ? Sigh !
2812 2018-01-17 18:03:15 Those poor small business oil companies? You need someone to check what you put on twitter
2813 2018-01-17 18:03:11 Oil free eye makeup remover, the entire Miracle set, lash intensity mascara, satin hands and lips, True Dimensions lipstick, the list goes on and on!! #ilovemymk

2817 2018-01-17 18:02:45 I've been drinking green tea 2 times a day for the past few days. I was reading all the great health benefits it has. Gunna stick with it. Taking vitamins & fish oil pills too. Making a mental checklist of habits I want to change.
2818 2018-01-17 18:02:41 get the redken extreme shampoo & conditioner in the dark blue bottles also: put a lil coconut oil on your ends every night (not to much or they’ll get oily) and do coconut oil masks!! with a mask since itll be super greasy afterwards you might wanna shampoo it twice afterward

2822 2018-01-17 18:02:10 Used to drill the oil but let it age beautifully cuz u deserve a solar energy
2823 2018-01-17 18:02:09 On the side of petrol/oil companies without the religion mask this time. War will still be here
2824 2018-01-17 18:02:06 No actually the physical environmental impact is greater too with ff what with the oil spills, coal ash spills, mountains being removed, increased mining, acid rain etc
2825 2018-01-17 18:01:47 I went to the grocery store to buy vegetable oil.... got everything else but
2826 2018-01-17 18:01:45 i ate too much
now i have headaches and efficascent oil as a perfume
2827 2018-01-17 18:01:34 No where near similar! Reagan didn’t insist on tax cuts for the 1%, he demanded tax cuts for the overtaxed businesses and oil companies.
2828 2018-01-17 18:01:33 Norway Desperately Needs Large Oil Discoveries
2829 2018-01-17 18:01:33 Why is there a coconut oil crisis in supermarkets? 
2830 2018-01-17 18:01:28 Yeah, I just made that mistake by replying to someone who is drowning in the snake oil.
2831 2018-01-17 18:01:20 オレンジさん……その方向なら豹柄さんとかもありえますかね……(混乱)
2832 2018-01-17 18:01:14 Mercado nacional de combustibles lidera YPF, con una participación en torno al 55% del total; Shell, con el 21%; Axion, con el 12%; Pampa (ex Petrobras), en proceso de venta a Trafigura, con el 6%; Oil, 4%, y el resto se reparte entre compañías menores.
2833 2018-01-17 18:01:13 It would have nothing  to do with opec cutting oil production in 2016 specifically to bring up the price . Trump would be the cause?
2834 2018-01-17 18:01:10 Instead, the media, but don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
2835 2018-01-17 18:00:49 Coconut oil is the shit !
2836 2018-01-17 18:00:49 هههههههههه
2837 2018-01-17 18:00:39 Murphy's oil will have your wood furniture looking nice and clean and your house will smell amazing
2838 2018-01-17 18:00:38 What a novel idea to run a business with no concern for net present value! No wonder the tight oil companies have been perpetually cash-flow negative. But wait, it will be different some day, right?
2839 2018-01-17 18:00:25 What kind of oil tho?
2840 2018-01-17 18:00:24 2. Oil! by Upton Sinclair
3. Preliminary Report on the Bituminous Sands of Northern Alberta by Sidney C. Ells #95books
2841 2018-01-17 18:00:17 "Loves"? You mean "forced to use wasteful SUV's bought for purpose by city, likely under lobbying pressure by automakers"? I thought so. #climatechange is very real, and very much created by our irresponsible use of fossil fuels. Ad buyers(oil co's) knew this in 1950's.
2842 2018-01-17 18:00:00 Estaciones de servicio ya venden las naftas 6% más caras. Se trata del primer ajuste del año. Ya aumentaron sus combustibles las petroleras Shell y Oil, mientras que el mercado espera las decisiones de YPF y Axion
2843 2018-01-17 17:59:53 I was appealing to his sensibilities, I don't necessarily care he said it. A lot of those countries are like that because of colonialism and interventionism, in some cases worsened because of the US trying to be philanthropic and ousting tyrants as a front for getting oil.
2844 2018-01-17 17:59:44 It's a shame Green Hill, Chemical Plant and Oil Ocean are missing. 
But I guess I can kinda understand why.
2845 2018-01-17 17:59:42 And the nations targeted don’t even include the nations most commonly known to harbor terrorists (Pakistan, Afganhistan, Saudi Arabia) 
Why’d they pick the 8 nations,
Because they owe the US oil money or they don’t have any oil
2846 2018-01-17 17:59:41 Sittin between two old ppl and one smells like cheese and the other smells like motor oil 
2847 2018-01-17 17:59:39 Пол Гетти, баснословно богатый основатель компании Getty Oil, назвал три секрета своего успеха: «Вставать рано, работать допоздна, найти нефтяное месторождение» (c) 
2848 2018-01-17 17:59:32 @LisaRaitt   Someone please remind Lac Megantic screw up Raitt who destroyed the Slberyan economy in the@era of the oil boom. REFORM CONS THEY WERE THE OIL PIMPS
2849 2018-01-17 17:59:25 「夜の街に現れて、酒場で一人で飲み始める若い男」「男は奇妙な魅力に溢れていて、彼の姿を見た女はつい声をかけてしまう」「男は話しても魅力的な人物で、女はたちまちまいってしまう」「だが男に着いていくと殺される」

2850 2018-01-17 17:59:09 Who wants to go with me to get an oil change on my car? I’m not tryin to walk around alone

2852 2018-01-17 17:58:57 Now that our poor financial state in the absence of significant oil revenue has been exposed.  We no longer hear the SNP using Scotland’s oil wealth or the country’s financial state to justify Scottish independence. 

When was the last time you heard Sturgeon calling for FFA?
2853 2018-01-17 17:58:44 Sensationalizing -67 deg C. Just like the media does during an oil spill with absurd units of measurement.
2854 2018-01-17 17:58:42 "Car friendly." Good example of an oxymoron. When killing for oil ends...when asthma from car exhaust is cured in kids...when #VisionZero's reached...when we have decent alternatives for nondrivers...when plundering countries for cobalt stops...maybe then cars will seem friendly.
2855 2018-01-17 17:58:15 Me and wife uses them, they work good for us, also the deep releaf oil is good for sore muscles, use it on regular basis, I think the lavender helps with sleep, wife uses it most nights.

2857 2018-01-17 17:58:13 Ogx keratin oil.. they’re in a pink bottle orrr Pantene repair and protect. Both great & affordable
2858 2018-01-17 17:58:05 Stayed home sick from work today. I don’t have a doctors note, so I’m hoping the picture I sent of me using my shirt to stem the steady flow from my nose will suffice. 

Help me, essential oil diffuser, you’re my only hope.
2859 2018-01-17 17:57:58 Did suggest pulling engine and do clutch and oil cooler at same time and do a deal on labour cost. But he declined, shame as makes life a LOT easier out in the floor. Was a crossed finger moment!!
2860 2018-01-17 17:57:54 i just got my CBD oil for my vape pen in the mail, it seems really good

can't wait to begin my transformation into That Obnoxious Fat Cloudchaser Guy You Know
2861 2018-01-17 17:57:34 i mean even i had to duck out after "i will fry your clit in mustard oil"
2862 2018-01-17 17:57:23 And they are being taxed to death to support the neo-lib government when CA has enough oil to more than fund their bs. It's a ponzi scheme
2863 2018-01-17 17:57:18 Depends on how much oil and where is on the lane, the ball and spinning style to be sure but yes it does happen in bowling some times.
2864 2018-01-17 17:57:18 You espouse so many contradictions and lies. Your buddies in big oil don't have our environmental concerns at heart ... yet I've seen you brag many times about how much you love our lakes and rivers. Which is it? #GOPcrooksandliars
2865 2018-01-17 17:57:06 I use a Razortip wood burner pen set. Once the design is finished, I sand it smooth, wash it with soap and water and rub vegetable oil in it.
2866 2018-01-17 17:57:01 Oil be back

2874 2018-01-17 17:56:09 How about some peer reviewed medical studies? This is just snake oil.  Taking advantage of the vulnerable.

I was playing $1,000 a hand at that point on house money Walked with $22,000.
2877 2018-01-17 17:55:36 extremely correct opinion there marben. A mate spent all night cooking 4 diff types of meat then sided it with plain pasta, it was a crying shame. Olive oil and herbs at least, guy
2878 2018-01-17 17:55:35 Well I just bought some african black soap and vitamin e oil. Hopefully it’s not too drying.
2879 2018-01-17 17:55:33 Imagine where we’d be if 41 and 43 had even mildly leveraged their knowledge/connections in the energy sector to have migrated away from fossil fuels — i.e., promote the national interest/energy independence (environmental sanity) above the interests of their oil and gas cronies.
2880 2018-01-17 17:55:28 Yall notice how David was annointed with a horn full of oil and Saul with a Flask???  lol im reading too much to it neh? Yeah Lol
2881 2018-01-17 17:55:23 isn't oil cheap??  good thing spills like this aren't reflected in prices at the pump or anything
2882 2018-01-17 17:55:21 We gaze upon Yosemite or Yellowstone, and see majestic divine beauty. He looks beyond the superficial, and sees barrels of oil and gas with his Exxon-ray vision.
2883 2018-01-17 17:55:09 TECH IS THE NEW OIL. #wataw18
2884 2018-01-17 17:55:09 And did you offer your thoughts and prayers? Maybe if the oil companies could find a way to profit off the crisis you might do something.
2885 2018-01-17 17:54:54 Ukraine will return to buying gas from Russia in 2018, ending a more than 2-year hiatus, as a result of a ruling by a Swedish arbitration court on its gas dispute w/ Moscow, the head of Ukrainian state-run energy firm Naftogaz said #Oil #Ukraine #Russia

2891 2018-01-17 17:54:22 Venezuela is a social democracy that was successful when it was based on oil. When the oil market crashed things started to go awry. You employ and extremely shallow analysis of socialism and don't even bother quoting anyone. I suggest you actually talk to a socialist or socdem.
2892 2018-01-17 17:54:19 UPDATE: Made an appointment for my roots! Decided an oil change and registration sticker can wait 
2893 2018-01-17 17:54:07 Ms. Pelosi you & Dems. MUST NOT give in to snake oil sales man paul ryan & the 90% of traitor's {(GOP's) to this country!! hold your ground! grow a spine DO NOT GIVE IN!! fight for CHIP,DACA & OB care!! enough is enough
2894 2018-01-17 17:53:58 Yes, interest of KSA in Yemen is obvious. KSA will run out of oil eventually, so they must encroach upon Yemen to steal it and subjugate its people.
2895 2018-01-17 17:53:46 New Deal style program to incentivize radical adoption of insulation, renewables on homes, businesses. Could employ out-of-work tradespeople, homeless, ex-cons... eliminate serfdom to Big Oil...
2896 2018-01-17 17:53:44 Odometer rolled over 4,000,000!?!  Time for an oil change?
2897 2018-01-17 17:53:41 my anthro class is in west commons & i can already tell I’m gonna be distracted because Olive Oil is right below us and it smells so fucking good

2946 2018-01-17 17:48:38 Shame on him laughing at King James English!

The word I still can't say is 'oil'.  It comes out aw-wul and people stare.  I learned to say 'Check under the hood, please.'
2947 2018-01-17 17:48:25 Oil is drilled far deeper than the stuff (fake dinosaur's ) that's supposed to create it is! So question is what us oil?

2951 2018-01-17 17:48:10 Everyone should complain about off shore drilling. It never works, we always have disasters and they never get cleaned up. Fish don’t like oil.

2987 2018-01-17 17:43:17 i blame the oil..
2988 2018-01-17 17:43:15 U.S. Oil Producers have a monopoly and have now set a cap on production to increase profits, This is unacceptable for the working class and price controls need to be re instated,
2989 2018-01-17 17:43:02 Yes may, it has the potential. Oil doesn't have this potential for expansion.
2990 2018-01-17 17:42:58 I thought these operations were the coolest, as a giant wake forms between the underway ships. We once had an emergency breakaway as the fuel oil transfer line failed. Now that was something.
2991 2018-01-17 17:42:55 @cfburch4 Yes! That one's always good. Well, if you're ever looking to try some infused olive oil and vinegar -- we're here for you!
2992 2018-01-17 17:42:49 Costco (in the US) has those, but with EVOO. Packs of maybe 10 or 12?  Also has anchovies in packs of 6.  No idea whether the olive oil is adulterated or not.

3039 2018-01-17 17:37:09 MSM is a f'cked up situation.
I called C4 News in the past stating words of Gen Wes Clark, Evidence of ISIS oil in Europe, Ex French Foreign Minister witness to UK deployment of "rebels" into Syria. C4 News reply was "nutter" talking & thanks 4 call. A put down of the facts & me.
3040 2018-01-17 17:36:59 When GE got the big idea to get in the Oil business, you should have run.  NYC suits and Rig Floor jumpsuits don't mix.  EVER.
3041 2018-01-17 17:36:59 You said they were virtually irreplaceable plus the process for coal could be sped up. plus you made it sound if oil is on the verge of being depleted & harder to get.

3048 2018-01-17 17:35:53 No, it's cause they hacked into Hillary and dnd private accounts and released info to the world. Cause Putin imprisons and poisons people. Cause he has people beaten to death in prison. Cause he wants to destroy Arctic w filthy oil. Got it?

Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. 6. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me (2/3)
3055 2018-01-17 17:34:51 You are not for the common people. Exploring for oil when you should be looking at alternative fuels, giving tax breaks to the rich while taking away from the poor. You should be ashamed.
3056 2018-01-17 17:34:47 My instructor asked me if I thought about why people conflates wars with freedom. I told her “wars have always been a propagation of a small group or persons interest. More often than not it has been about capitalism. Millions of people died so America could mine oil”

3064 2018-01-17 17:33:45 Undoubtedly, #MustardOil is a natural, highly efficient massage oil formulated by Mother Nature herself! It soothes, it moistens, it relaxes, it rejuvenates and it detoxifies. What more could anyone ask for?
3065 2018-01-17 17:33:39 I am taller than KAI... I guess that peaches helps you grow better than curry and chili oil...
3066 2018-01-17 17:33:38 China is grandstanding with the yuan oil contract. They have little if any leverage on US. Fed acquired 200% China's US debt in six years. Could easily soak up ALL of China's holdings if the latter liquidated.

3073 2018-01-17 17:33:19 I was pretty flakey for a while following a routine like that. Now I just was my face with clean and clear morning/night washes. And I use Cetaphil oil control moisturizer for acne skin with spf 30 OR Lubiderm daily moisturizer for dry skin. I put on metronidazole gel at night.

3085 2018-01-17 17:32:28 Kristen do you ride a bicycle everywhere you go? No. Then shut up. The world will not end and the beaches will not die and the fish will survive. There are more fish wasted everyday by fish eating humans than ever have been killed by oil.
3086 2018-01-17 17:32:27 Would it be super-cruel if I suggested I've got a great real estate deal in central Florida I'd love to talk to these guys about?? Yes, I guess it would. But it does beg the question of emotional intelligence: How did SO MANY people buy this snake oil??

3112 2018-01-17 17:29:53 If I deep clean my phone screen and give it a wipe with a dryer sheet it repels dog hair and whatnot, but its over as soon as I touch the screen and get even a little bit of oil on it. Its lame.
3113 2018-01-17 17:29:49 Ever since I saw my dad oil painting (he's been a painter for ~40yrs)! Really clicked with me, did traditional artwork until I could buy a tablet, so digital past ~5yrs, traditional all before that :)

3116 2018-01-17 17:29:26 That is complete tosh! How can tailoring immigration to a nation's needs be problematic. Your ignorance of how the oil & gas sector actually works is very scary & extremely unhelpful!
3117 2018-01-17 17:29:23 For this is what the Lord , the God of Israel, says: ‘The jar of flour will not be used up and the jug of oil will not run dry until the day the Lord sends rain on the land.’ ”
3118 2018-01-17 17:29:13 Dean. As a sensible question to you can you advise where the billions of barrels of oil are ? I know you haven't said directly there are billions but the company and a fat Austrailian has said so time and time again . An answer if you please
3119 2018-01-17 17:29:13 IF you could, you'd see the snake oil salesman for what he is.

I do hope you get that sorted. Cheers.

3123 2018-01-17 17:28:23 By reducing the amount of energy used in the AC then less energy has to be produced by power plants, and in the long run reducing how much fuel, whether that be wood, oil, gas, etc., they consume. All of which creates emissions.

3130 2018-01-17 17:27:05 I have combo dry/oily skin and use CosRX Soothing Aloe sun cream. A bit pricey but my T zone doesn't turn into an oil slick, and if I wear foundation it doesn't pill at all. If you're hella dry, try La Roche Posay's Anthelios XL. Not sure what to use if you're oily, though.
3131 2018-01-17 17:26:59 Poloz reiterated that it is data dependent and that is brining strength to CAD. I see it appreciate it further. Oil and natural resources are all at their highs. All is positive for CAD. #poloz #boc #usdcad

3149 2018-01-17 17:24:34 Oil is probably the most important wartime commodity. USG doesn't put tariffs on oil imports from Saudi Arabia, correct? By same logic, shouldn't that be a huge national security concern?
3150 2018-01-17 17:24:31 Every day over 9 million gallons of Amazon crude are extracted from oil wells in the western Amazon rainforest, shipped to refineries in the U.S., and processed into fuel that ends up in vehicle fleets across the country.
3151 2018-01-17 17:24:25 Let’s lead with green energy and do away with fossil fuels. Let coal die. Let oil die. The oil and coal companies that realize they’re dying are starting to look to green energy. They know they need to move on.
3152 2018-01-17 17:24:00 ATTENTION: OUR WORLD  IS CHANGING!!! WE HAVE RECORD LOW TEMPERATURES EVERYWHERE. We need to switch to #RenewableEnergy ASAP #ClimateChange is due to humans for fossil fuels & oil. #GlobalWarming has altered our Climate & temperatures, plus & minus average! #Solar #Wind etc.

3158 2018-01-17 17:23:24 With respect you are starting from the wrong point IMHO. We bring a diverse culture, people, resources, industries. But we are much more expensive to service due to geography and demography-as such we are far too reliant on oil to retain decent public services in Indy.

3162 2018-01-17 17:22:50 All the cunts (City Arsenal and Chelsea fans) saying it’s about the money. Truth is Sanchez chose United because it’s the biggest fucking club in England. Chelsea and City would be irrelevant without Russian mafia and Arab oil money. 
At least we spend what we earn.

3172 2018-01-17 17:21:22 I’ve been covering myself in coconut oil every day after I shower and let me just tell you how much my body appreciates me rn so soft omg
3173 2018-01-17 17:21:22 Who uses avocado oil for moisturizing?
3174 2018-01-17 17:21:13 My favorite thing is when editors request request latex garments and as for “oil.” It’s just lube. Silicone lube.
3175 2018-01-17 17:21:02 Me too. Been using their oil for years. It’s fantastic.
3176 2018-01-17 17:20:59 Can imagine Saudi Arabia telling Congo to make a production cut in cobalt and not oil.
3177 2018-01-17 17:20:55 It's such a death sentence, it heightens the barrier of entrance and pours boiling oil on those already climbing. This will lead to stagnation and inevitably, death.

3183 2018-01-17 17:20:20 What happened to your oil job?
3184 2018-01-17 17:20:15 So many. Blow out with Fekkai blow out spray. Then iron (alternate sections using the deep waver and the curling iron) and sometimes a little rodin oil if it's dry on the ends and sometimes oribe dry texturing spray if it's too clean.
3185 2018-01-17 17:20:06 @brianmilonas I got a diffuser oil at Disney springs that smells like the contemporary!
3186 2018-01-17 17:20:00 My tank is 1200 litres an has about 600 litres of oil currently sat in it. Unfortunately the regs in the UK won't allow anything other than a certified product to be used. It's gonna have to be a new tank fitted by an Ofted registered fitter.

3188 2018-01-17 17:19:32 Indeed, the only reason US & UK cosy up to the appalling Saudi Barbaria is because of oil and the revenue it brings.
3189 2018-01-17 17:19:26 It's treating symptoms, menthol oil for example can be very soothing but it won't do shit to cure you.

3236 2018-01-17 17:14:12 Dry meat cooked in fat (oil) is the recipe stolen from heaven's kitchen.

the life that, here, awaits.
I don't belong to anyone.
My heart is heavy as an oil drum.
I don't want to be alone.
3242 2018-01-17 17:13:23 Ezra, you should visit Texas. Texas gets a bad rap as a red state, but when you drive to Marfa from ATX on I10, you will see rows and rows of windmill farms right next to oil pumps. There are many solar farms near Marfa as well
3243 2018-01-17 17:13:18 It's hilarious how a club spending its own football-generated revenue angers people so much, yet clubs spending Russian & Arab government/oil money are cool. It's as if people are acting stupidly on purpose based on some bias or agenda.

3316 2018-01-17 17:04:49 He cares only that he & his family are making money! The ‘economy’ he’s talking about is for big Corps, banks, oil/gas/coal corps, & oligarchs. Not the economy of the everyday hard working ppl trying to pay their rent, their healthcare, their everyday living expenses.
3317 2018-01-17 17:04:46 Starting to have major issues with woofuckery, especially in support groups for Celiac disease. Why do any of them bother with a dr? "Oil of Oregano, I put yhat on everything!" That's because you are a meatball, Janet.
3318 2018-01-17 17:04:44 ever mixed a hot oil treatment with your conditioner to create a deep conditioning treatment?

3334 2018-01-17 17:02:40 When you're waiting a million hours to get your oil changed and tires  rotated but can't really complain because you get it free 
3335 2018-01-17 17:02:39 Except those folks have wisely included Santa Clara and Contra Costa Counties in "New California".  That's Silicon Valley and at least four oil refineries. There's a huge chunk of their tax base. They don't need our taxes.
3336 2018-01-17 17:02:33 I'm guessing that you aren't actually stating oil or gold are anywhere near as volatile as Bitcoin, because that's empirically false.
3337 2018-01-17 17:02:27 It's going to look like annoying little inconveniences, like banning plastic shopping bags. But our addiction to oil must end; it's killing the planet, our democracy, and us with it.

3339 2018-01-17 17:02:11 When Scottish oil started flowing in the 1970s it was a bit like us winning the lottery and allowing our next door neighbours to cash the ticket and spend it on whatever they chose as long as they dropped us a shilling or two once in a while.
3340 2018-01-17 17:02:08 As though player's signed for city to play for the club, if the club didn't had oil daddy how many of the current lot would have signed, ITS JUST PURE HATE WHEN ANY PLAYER SIGNS FOR MAN UTD, GGMU

3345 2018-01-17 17:01:53 Oil bouncing. 65.20, 69 soon!
3346 2018-01-17 17:01:46 BoC's Poloz doesn't want people thinking about Canada and US economies as in sync. "We are behind them, to some degree," because of momentum lost to oil collapse, Poloz said. US kept growing during that period.
3347 2018-01-17 17:01:46 No thank you. I won’t trust ANYTHING that comes from #Maduro ‘s mouth. They already sold the future oil.
3348 2018-01-17 17:01:37 Your doctor will always encourage preventative health. So will a mechanic! Don't underestimate the importance of a regular oil change
3349 2018-01-17 17:01:33 In my humble opinion, everybody who were doubting KSA's optimism on an oil deal last year were later stunned when the deal actually happened. Views of @anasalhajji may provide the required guidance here because his hands seem on the pulse of global oil trade.
3350 2018-01-17 17:01:28 If that oil tastes like pizza then absolutely!
3351 2018-01-17 17:01:22 PSA if you're looking for bargain deals on things like coconut oil, coconut sugar, chia seeds, plant protein, and such check out home goods!!!! they have a mini whole foods section all discounted
3352 2018-01-17 17:01:21 So is maple syrup really some kind of lubricating oil?
3353 2018-01-17 17:01:18 How? By filling his admin with Goldman bankers and the military? Saudi arms deal? Selling off public land to corporations and US coastlines to oil companies? He’s just like all the other presidents before him, in it for the money and to pretend otherwise is a joke

3359 2018-01-17 17:00:12 Beyond the environmental issues described in that article, consider all plastic as a political risk because it's made of oil. This attack on US by Russia? Because of lost fossil fuel revenues amounting to nearly a trillion $.

3377 2018-01-17 16:57:52 It is now. With the robber oil barons running the country, clean air and clean water are no longer a concern of the Republican party. Only money. Only greed. They do not care about the environment.

3385 2018-01-17 16:56:53 of all things Trump has done this far, this one ranks way below colluding with the Russians, obstructing justice, making racist statements, tearing families apart through deportations, enacting racist immigration policies, and exposing our environment to oil drillers.

Haven't met with Natuonal Parks board...ever.Pathetic emphasis on drilling of oil/gas, mining on federal lands/waters.Rolling back policies to protect our lands. @EricTrump said all DJT cares about is green/money.

3406 2018-01-17 16:53:50 And shout out to my bio oil literally used it for two days straight twice a day like recommended and the appearance of my stretch marks are already less noticeable 
3407 2018-01-17 16:53:50 Exports of oil to us - that's their biggest money spinner.
3408 2018-01-17 16:53:46 My days, the salt is strong on this post..  Turn it in you set of manufactured, Arab oil bastards. You'd be nothing without corrupt money, you have no room to talk. £14m works out at around £269-£270k. Where the fuck are people getting £500k from? 
3409 2018-01-17 16:53:44 I know it sounds kinda gross but I rub a little olive oil on to my lips a couple times a day and they healed super fast and are really soft!

3417 2018-01-17 16:53:03 Ordered peppermint oil.  Hopefully it helps with the ants.  If not, at least my house will smell delicious.
3418 2018-01-17 16:52:59 Except the @FFAW_Unifor is really using that as an argument to gain access to those areas, not to shut out oil exploration.
3419 2018-01-17 16:52:56 La mia faccia continua indisturbatatamente a spellarsi. Mi sta sorgendo il dubbio che la colpa sia dell’oil wash. Ma ALLORA DYO ME LO SPIEGHI TU COME MI DEVO LAVARE QUESTA FACCIA CHE NON L’HO MICA CAPITO?!?!

It's quite funny that they were willing to pay everything for Mbappe and Sanchez in the summer and now can't even break 20m for the player. Wonder is FFP has finally struck fear into the oil money.

3455 2018-01-17 16:49:05 Sometimes skin can be over producing oil because it is dry which is true but not always the case. If your skin type is oily then you would want to use drying products. That will help reduce the size of your pores which would also stop the over production of oil. To prevent over

3466 2018-01-17 16:48:07 CBD oil has many angles to it. It IS hyped up. And yet my rectal cancer experience w/20% CBD post-5wk radio/chemo, then 10% after my lower ant. resection, proved beneficial *to me* (e.g appetite, relaxant, meditation). As a compliment to the lifesaving SNHS treatment, I add!

3480 2018-01-17 16:46:41 This is not about being afraid Scotland is part of UK and thankfully will remain so. All the rhetoric that they can survive on oil revenue is a myth. Waters round all of UK are determined by Continental shelf act=oil is a UK commodity
3481 2018-01-17 16:46:36 The only adequate way of punishing this pos is to be very slowly lowered feet first into a vat of boiling oil in a public display
3482 2018-01-17 16:46:33 Yeah, "labour shortage" is my favourite whining. Had that in the oil-sands here with $100/bbl oil and record profits ... "no labour" but of course can't raise wages and "have" to import "temporary foreign workers" instead

3489 2018-01-17 16:45:58 WHAT is 'all ours'? Not the price of oil. Only the tex revenue on PROFITS - of which there aren't much at present, with costs to offset. You think we'd get all of the price?

3505 2018-01-17 16:44:11 I've theory as to why USSR collapsed. I don't believe oil prices played major role as broadly known. I think it was strong free education, that is most powerful weapon, that forced arch rivals to set sort of ultimatum: Restrain "weapon" or war.

3558 2018-01-17 16:38:18 Mustard oil is one of the effective natural earwax removal remedies. Just pour a few drops of warm mustard oil in the affected ear. Keep it for 5 minutes. Repeat the same process with the other ear to soften the wax. Later, clean with a cotton ball.

3606 2018-01-17 16:33:25 Oil is oily?
3607 2018-01-17 16:33:24 Norway's economy is very different to the UK's... Small population; relatively high taxation; and abundant natural resources in oil and forestry. 
Not especially something the UK can emulate.
3608 2018-01-17 16:33:23 one last dip on the dollar, rally in gold, eurusd & oil and there would be complete divergence at bang on key levels.... Lets see if we get the last puffs on these moves before BIG REVERSALS

3610 2018-01-17 16:33:10 Do you mean, they are BRIBING YEMEN TO KEEP QUIET? Obama flew thousands of drone strikes into Yemen for Saudi Arabia, under the direction of  their business buddy, Bush. 
We have LITERALLY been killing Bush/Bin Laden oil business competition in the Middle East. (See Iraq)

3619 2018-01-17 16:31:43 Holi is coming and we all get trouble to remove colours. You can apply mustard oil on your face, neck, ears, hands and legs a day before Holi. The colour can be easily removed from your skin by doing this.

3620 2018-01-17 16:31:39 Considering the immensely destructive impact the palm oil industry has on biodiversity, banning it in the EU should be the next logical step. It's unbelievable how it's found nearly everything from toothpaste to cereals, surely there are better, more sustainable alternatives?
3621 2018-01-17 16:31:18 Alaskans own 700 shares of LAREDO PETROLEUM INC, worth $10,220. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in UNITED STATES.

3641 2018-01-17 16:28:28 Use Mustard Oil at night for massaging. Massage it into your skin every night for 10 minutes and then wash it off with a mild face wash. In a few days you’ll notice your skin not only getting lighter but also much softer.

The Norwegian Shelf will be a busy workplace over coming years if the oil companies seize the opportunity and utilize the many licenses they have just been awarded. Statoil and Aker BP were the big winners

3661 2018-01-17 16:26:30 Only P2.50 in the oil hike is due to TRAIN Law. The rest comes from world oil price hike.
3662 2018-01-17 16:26:28 I mean, olive oil is supposed to be good for us, right? And our parent drank castor oil for health, so I'm totally fine with this. Enjoy!

3685 2018-01-17 16:23:56 Peak meant a peak, irreversible decline combined with price increases was an integral part of peak oil. 

The concept of a plateau was contrary, "peak" oil is being reinterpreted as max oil production. 

The whole thing was based on a symmetric bell-shaped supply curve.
3686 2018-01-17 16:23:48 But the fund was set up specifically because the oil proceeds were (and are) way too big to ever be spent domestically. We could give it away, but suspect that would be politically unpopular.

3694 2018-01-17 16:22:53 Speaking as someone who burned the midnight oil for one for six solid years, I can't agree with this more. Getting to know people on the ground in my community via writing has created a far more rewarding postscript than churning out 1000-word clickbait hot takes.

3702 2018-01-17 16:21:54 true.  but not convinced that there would be a global equilibrium is all the petro-states used their oil just to build up financial assets.  oil importers would all be massively in debt to the oil exporting economies -and there would be a global demand problem.  just saying ...

3705 2018-01-17 16:21:46 $2 billion have been deposited in Central Bank of Yemen. Good news. But we still have a huge challenge: Govt being outside Yemen & inefficient management of Central Bank. For me, why don't we also talk abut resuming oil & gas investments that have been shut down since mid 2015?

3720 2018-01-17 16:20:28 Benefits should be based on what you’ve paid in. I was unemployed recently here in the US due to the oil industry downturn. My UB was based on what I paid in and when it ran out, there was no more. Glad to say, I’m back to work fairly quickly.

3732 2018-01-17 16:18:23 Terrible article. The wealth of a nation comes from tax payers, for the most part. Oil proceeds can not fund a legit gov’t on its own. To cast Norwegians as lazy rather than more proficiently industrious than the US is unfounded. Read up on the Nordic Model.

Fat isn't.
3738 2018-01-17 16:17:20 Lately, I've decided that for nothing to affect me, my bathroom has to be with liters of oil, so that everything slips. It is the best decision!
3739 2018-01-17 16:17:19 We made it today, so we are open and waiting for you to get here. The inspector isn't here yet so we will only be doing oil changes for now.
3740 2018-01-17 16:17:10 TBF, they are sitting on a pile of oil.  But they also just make choices that Americans don't make--it's VERY expensive to eat out, they have great public tran, they figure that letting people care for their families helps business in  long run...& they are very child-centered.
3741 2018-01-17 16:17:09 Let's get back on the oil rollercoaster! Yeehaaw!

3743 2018-01-17 16:16:58 I just heard about caramelized onion hummus. Scratch the bean dip idea, I need onions, chickpeas, lemon, garlic, olive oil, salt, a blender, and a stove. (Maybe cilantro still)
3744 2018-01-17 16:16:56 Great question. The oil boom required people with a very wide range of skills and this is why the benefits in terms of income gained were so widespread. As the boom fades will those at the low end of income distribution be able to hang on to these gains in purchasing power?
3745 2018-01-17 16:16:52 Influence how, exactly?   Reducing production just drives the cost of oil up (see OPEC) and spurs exploration.  What is it you think oil companies can do to reduce consumption?

A bit like a buttery turnip I guess? Very neutral, a bit sweet. I suppose like a wetter white potato in ways?

3785 2018-01-17 16:13:25 None. Even Venezuela, touted by some as "a socialist success" in the past, before the oil prices plummeted and showed the truth of the matter, was a mixed economic system with additional anti-business and pro-social programs and policies enforced by the government.
3786 2018-01-17 16:13:20 Some were predicting that, others weren't. There was never a single view, or a single statement of what "peak oil" meant. And that was a problem.

3890 2018-01-17 16:00:03 Mojo sauce, a garlic, Spanish paprika, red pepper, cumin seed, olive oil, wine vinegar, salt and bread miga to thicken it
3891 2018-01-17 15:59:48 I just thought to myself "Ooh, something smells good," and realized that what I was smelling was vaporizing oil, which is to say I smelled something frying. Made me feel simultaneously culinarily intelligent and fuckin low-class.

Him: BU-
Me: Just go down the aisle

3902 2018-01-17 15:58:47 It's never the exit I worry about. It's re-entry. Standing under falling knives is a bit like working on an oil rig platform: 6 tons of moving equipment 100 feet over your head is not where I want to be standing. #HODL
3903 2018-01-17 15:58:41 It sounds like they are creating the bull market in the price of crude oil.

3906 2018-01-17 15:58:15 Flake decided he is righteous. That he alone has holy visions of truth. That he is the prophet and anointed with oil. He is exactly who Americans should not trust or blindly follow. The people should always question institutional power, as PresTrump is doing.
3907 2018-01-17 15:57:59 I contacted y’all and they sent me a beard balm - I was told all the oils have rosemary but none of the balms do. I prefer the oil, but I am enjoying the balm.
3908 2018-01-17 15:57:56 It's true that Venezuela has more oil than Saudi Arabia.  But it's also true it has 2,600,000 hectares of arable land, according to the World Bank.  It has 47,713,000 hectares of rich forest.  Gold.  Diamonds.  Caribbean beaches.  In brief, it has EVERYTHING. #NoExcuses
3909 2018-01-17 15:57:53 You realize that this mandate would likely end up replacing oil with coal? Where do you think the massive amounts of electricity would come from?

3929 2018-01-17 15:55:08 Citi is just crushing the technical analysis game! First they try to fundamentally justify a technical breakout in oil and now they're trying to fundamentally justify a breakdown of a typical bubble pattern in bitcoin...

3950 2018-01-17 15:51:52 Substitute the word "supply" for "demand" in that statement, and you have a canonical statement of "peak oil" circa 2007. (But it's OK for Dale to say "demand"...it was not OK for him to say "supply"..even though it's the same thing.)
3951 2018-01-17 15:51:44 &2000.00 isn’t two mortgage payments. $2000 isn’t enough fuel oil to heat a New England home for the winter months. Especially when a full tank can cost up to $500.00

3960 2018-01-17 15:50:21 It's structurally a non-starter. However, if China were to list a forward oil contract in (say) HK & commit two or three million bpd to periodic auctions, then things would get interesting since this would expose the two-tier ICE false market in Brent/BFOE

3996 2018-01-17 15:47:51 There is no justice for Native people in ND...maybe anywhere. Red Fawn is being used as an example...North Dakota’s way of scaring Native people to inaction...the oil industry rules this state, and this is what happens when you stand against it.

4013 2018-01-17 15:46:12 The fact that they are trying to classify CBD oil as the same level drug as heroin is complete and udder bullshit. Its not even psychoactive

4016 2018-01-17 15:45:45 If the sale price is low then it is clearly due to the corruption that lies between KRG and Turkey as the only oil export outlet. Turkey can easily apply heavy surcharges as it knows KRG is exporting clandestinely ! They have them by the "short and curlies" !!
4017 2018-01-17 15:45:27 You're partly right, due to the fact that countries that have large oil industries are often where democracy has the most difficulty to flourish

No other industry is more damaging to democracies
In some countries, including Canada, they represent the true "deep state"

4031 2018-01-17 15:44:09 Not really. The overall growth of palm oil production is so much, that  this decision will not lower the palm oil demand. It will temper the  growth, and hence temper deforestation and displacement of communities. That's pretty good news for indigenous peoples.
4032 2018-01-17 15:43:33 Could only be a matter of time before fuel or oil gets into the stream

4044 2018-01-17 15:42:31 the hate united gets is incredible. they're spending the money they earned not oil money from a rich benefactor. the same cannot be said of city. where was the outrage when pep spent a hundred million on fullbacks? but i forgot everybody loves pep and he can do no wrong. #mufc
4045 2018-01-17 15:42:17 Like, warm areas have different freaking hydrants than cold areas. Central heating isn't required. Insulation isn't as important. Cars don't have same antifreeze, oil, windshield washer fluid, windshield wipers, tires...it's a freaking nightmare to have this suddenly.
4046 2018-01-17 15:42:06 Did you know that you can bring down a fever with Lemon ! I used diluted Lemon essential oil with coconut oil and applied to the spine & bottoms of feet. My 2 year olds fever was under control right away. #younglivingessentialoils #feverreducer

4066 2018-01-17 15:39:48 I always try going to get an oil change and my dad always tells me no not yet. But now that’s I need one I’m getting bitched at. LIKE WTH
4067 2018-01-17 15:39:44 #TaxScamBill aside, something you need to address:
National Parks are being opened up for oil/gas/minerals for private corporations. At the same time National Park Fee's are set to double...and a proposed .25 per gallon tax on gas is on the table. You are from Cortez, how are 1/
4068 2018-01-17 15:39:31 The lip protectant is the best lip balm I’ve had. It’s a classic. I recently tried Cowshed bath oil too, that’s decent too and you can use it for massage

4073 2018-01-17 15:38:37 The vested interests in the #fracking, oil & gas interests amongst MPs (incl #DavidCameron & several of his then Cabinet) does not bear 5 minutes of scrutiny. Including links to banks, Treasury, rellies, friends.
4074 2018-01-17 15:38:23 I want a boo  a manly man, someone who will split the dinner bill someone who will come over and help oil and twist my hair .... someone I can talk to 24\7 w/o wanting to cut his throat open

4079 2018-01-17 15:38:10 Mate you brought up the “oil money” line I was merely trying to provide you with context.. it’s clear though that this subject makes you emotional & you don’t want to hear any real facts.. like the fact that Qatar & Abu Dhabi are two different places.
4080 2018-01-17 15:38:09 Sure, oil and gas are important. But they're not so important or so irreplaceable that we should sacrifice everything else everywhere for maximum drilling in the short term.
4081 2018-01-17 15:38:09 OIL DIFF: 5.57 -> 5.64

4097 2018-01-17 15:35:45 Don’t know the new guy, but his prior was as quick as a whip to blame an oil spill on a fictional Iranian tanker back in August when in fact it originated from his shoreline. I wouldn’t trust him to tell me the time, Erik.

4111 2018-01-17 15:34:39 If I had the time and money  (and access to a proper butcher that isn't just my supermarket) I would absolutely put in the effort to switch my petd to mainly raw. But for now I just settle for raw eggs a few times per week, some occasional raw bacon, and salmon oil.
4112 2018-01-17 15:34:26 Grangemouth ref. in Scotland started op. in 1924, shutdown between 1939-1946 by WWII, & recommenced in 1946 after major revamp. Since then, a number of upgrades have been done to accommodate North Sea oil. Therefore, it’s not about age, but a case of poor management & corruption!
4113 2018-01-17 15:34:21 coconut oil helps with everything
4114 2018-01-17 15:34:10 Aww no if you were looking for more than one product I would suggest the seaweed range for oil control and if your dry skin is super dry the hemp face protector and then also multi mask once or twice a week
4115 2018-01-17 15:34:03 We have enough for us.  You are now allowing oil and gas companies to risk our environment so they can produce more for their own export profits, nothing more. You only care about quick profits and not our environment and future generations.
4116 2018-01-17 15:34:02 You're going to tell me it makes sense RBOB Gasoline is firmly higher by +1% right now, & Heating Oil in the green... Also note: Natural Gas is best performer of the day +2.36%! ...And #Crude #Oil $CL_F is down -.03 -0.05% @ 63.70?! *C'mon enough with the manipulation already...

4129 2018-01-17 15:33:14 @whsource on Sigma Nutrition #200 you mentioned EVOO being the most well researched and safest oil to use. I have concerns about cooking with EVOO because of its relatively low smoke point. Do you agree?
4130 2018-01-17 15:32:58 No your just confused about the truth.  We want oil and etc.  we have the money now they just stopped the lights

4146 2018-01-17 15:31:27 I have to try garlic bread with goat butter. We usually use olive oil with seasonings on ours. You could probably get 100 people using the same recipe, but the tastes in the end, may all differ. At least, if you know when you're going, you don't want to wear a favorite shirt.

4214 2018-01-17 15:23:01 But the strategy is not simply to give fee money to billionaires. It’s to bring visitor numbers down so they can say no one uses parks. Then annex public lands for private use for oil, mineral, timber, grazing, etc. Its foxes guarding the henhouse.

4233 2018-01-17 15:21:03 It is interesting to see when civilised pressure is applied then politicians will fall back into acceptable modes of behaviour. First time since 2003 do we see publication of KRG oil production and exports. Now show us the money trail associated with these exports if you dare !

If you're like me you have an slightly used jar of Virgin Coconut oil you have tried to love, but just can't stand the aftertaste. You can use it in a pinch if you run out of carrier oil. Very long shelf life.

Higher oil prices benefit Canada less than elsewhere (due to price spreads).

Near-term inflation to fluctuate due to temporary factors.

4427 2018-01-17 14:59:45 MCT oil is burned by the liver. Basically, it's a fat that won't be deposited as fat that your body can use for fuel. The BHB is an exogenous ketone. It helps you get into/maintain ketosis, which is the basis of the keto diet.

4448 2018-01-17 14:58:15 Chavezuro turned a successful fossil fuel goldmine into a famine stricken dictatorship via a decade long unprecedented boom in oil prices. Pretty remarkable.
4449 2018-01-17 14:58:14 Seriously! All this does is make me want to eat pizza and chocolate and feel better not having eaten plain oil and sugar. Clearly I can be a nutritionist now
4450 2018-01-17 14:58:05 Chevron has the largest wind farm in the USA in west Texas , I want more clean nuclear plants ! Which allows for KWH growth for more factory consumption !  Less oil ! Less coal ! The issue is not energy type, it's total KWH consumption in heavy populations areas

2.Price of oil goes up today... gas goes up tomorrow.  Price of oil goes down tomorrow... gas goes down in a week.
4480 2018-01-17 14:54:39 Wrong 45% of US elect comes from coal!  Natural gas is only 25% and morons in NY and other states have banned fracking so that’s a bust now too. We have more gas and oil than anywhere but won’t get it because wack jobs blocking it.

4580 2018-01-17 14:43:41 Lmao oil city , it’s expected to be expensive; but a place with no actual growth can’t be expensive , businesses will just go bankrupt
4581 2018-01-17 14:43:41 Sometimes moisturizing makes your skin think "okay, we're very wet now and it is not great. let's get really dry and see if that's better."

Like my face is super oily, and it gets worse if I try to dry it. I'm supposed to use more oil to dry it?

Skin is a paradox.
4582 2018-01-17 14:43:35 best diet ever., eat broccoli for your vitamin c.  sautee with olive oil, salt, pepper = MONEY!
4583 2018-01-17 14:43:09 Hahaha no. Just a general observation. Oil changes are a breeze, literally under ten minutes, they charge for exact liters so you have no leftover bottles, and they take card too. Wish everywhere was this convenient lol.
4584 2018-01-17 14:43:09 @Lindakx947 @ToffKX947 All I can say is " Oil of Oregano" I am sure that is the basis for Buckly's mixture, because it tastes awefule..but it works! Out a few drops on the back of your throat and your caugh is GONE!!!

4587 2018-01-17 14:42:54 Does that count as sensible diversification when the entire region runs on oil money?
4588 2018-01-17 14:42:53 imo.. maybe a selloff on oil stocks.. hasn't been this high in over a year.. was climbing $65+ a barrel
4589 2018-01-17 14:42:47 We'll be number one when the Middle East oil fields dry up within the next 30 years

4601 2018-01-17 14:42:02 Dumb as a rock. Repubs in charge this state would have most beaches developed, half the state parks, oil platforms off the coast, much more sprawl vs smart planning, more crime and a hell of a lot more pollution, because GOP too chicken to make companies do the right thing
4602 2018-01-17 14:42:00 I don't give the Dems that much credit.. there was a selloff in tech yesterday. and price of oil dropped yesterday too.. Russian/China are merging in some kind of oil deal.. will flood the supply

4615 2018-01-17 14:40:31 Thanks! Just the first part of the question then. Oil prices impacting the budget and where do you think the focus would be. Fiscal discipline/boosting private investment.
4616 2018-01-17 14:40:27 for positions for the oil drilling you support @AsmPatODonnell ?
4617 2018-01-17 14:40:21 Trying to decrease the amount of oil I cook with so I bought a stove top grill from @Groupon & I’m sooo excited!!

4624 2018-01-17 14:40:03 Reformulation of gasoline solved the problem by the oil/gas industry. EPA had little to do with it other than onerous expensive to consumer regulations.

4644 2018-01-17 14:37:20 It’s nobody’s business how many kids people are blessed with. Those nut-heads don’t understand it’s a blessing. If they discovered they sit on a oil field, their politics would quickly change.
4645 2018-01-17 14:37:13 #ADNOC’s six-fold increase in the utilization of CO2, will see about 5 million metric tons of the greenhouse gas collected every year, and will help achieve up to 70% ultimate oil recovery rate from oil fields
4646 2018-01-17 14:37:08 What's happening now? Oil at $70?
4647 2018-01-17 14:37:06 Endless repetitive dishonest propaganda

It's so disingenuous to consistently characterize opponents as part of some "group"
Most of us are individuals who simply believe in science over big oil propaganda
The most expensive oil to produce will be first squeezed out of the market
4648 2018-01-17 14:37:04 @GMA @RobinRoberts, I believe the   that u gave while tasting that oregano oil will probably b a gif...classic
4649 2018-01-17 14:37:01 Beautiful! Just hope it wasn't due to an oil spill. That beauty might be sick.
4650 2018-01-17 14:37:00 Why not focus more on foreign oil that comes into Canada. Using less of it will lower world greenhouse emissions

But i did not speak up because i am not a banker. Then they came for the telecoms. And i couldn’t speak up because they jacked up my cell phone bill.
4657 2018-01-17 14:36:20 You don’t get the oil until there has been a crushing.

4660 2018-01-17 14:35:21 Ladies. Put down the sodas and drink water. Stop smoking blacks and cigarettes and smoke good. Take care of your real nails under your fake nails. Eat a balanced diet. Stay active. Use coconut oil for an everyday moisturizer for EVERYTHING (hair, lips/face, and body)

4676 2018-01-17 14:32:13 2/2 ...then it's treasonous 2 financially underwrite them. 
But we can stop that without breaking apart. 
B/c I now believe breaking up CA is just Putin laying groundwork - if even by conversation - 4 AKIP succeeding. 
Then, he bleeds Arctic of its oil. 
Then, our planet is gone.
4677 2018-01-17 14:31:52 Remember when science suggested we eat our bread with oil instead of butter. Its healthier and you feel full faster. Now I know that pizza is oil and bread. So, yay!
4678 2018-01-17 14:31:11 So I want to remind everyone what we are fighting for –, and don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
4679 2018-01-17 14:30:49 @KingSalman You don't need big oil prices. Saudi Arabia together with Russia needs low oil prices, weak currencies, developed, diversified economies.
4680 2018-01-17 14:30:42 With oil looking to be stable and around the $70 for the rest of the year, how do you see that impacting the budget and consequently where can one find value in the equity markets?

4693 2018-01-17 14:28:32 So you should begin a crusade to ween the country of all imported oil and relegate Saudi Arabia to the same strategic value as Kazakhstan. Then your "but Obama did it" argument would make sense.

4697 2018-01-17 14:27:52 Over regulation made us lose thousands of jobs. Obama's war on coal and oil for example.

4854 2018-01-17 14:07:40 IMO nothing will replace the USD.  IMO it's clear the USD is losing its 45-74 yr old global oil & commodity pricing monopoly.  As it does, this means US deficits "matter" for the 1st time in 45-70 yrs.  This has extremely negative consequences for the relative value of the USD.

100k for a guy below 26/27 is not poor at all. Considering the salary would only increase later on.

Not everyone will work in Oil company and banks.
4880 2018-01-17 14:04:50 I had one the other day and it was aaaaaamazing. All the oil made me feel yucky tho, and my friend has had issues with them always accidentally giving him meat patties, but besides that they’re tasty as fuck
4881 2018-01-17 14:04:30 It is truly outrageous that all of our national landmarks will now be sold off to the Koch brothers for oil drilling, plutocratic hunting parties, and other forms of land-rape.
4882 2018-01-17 14:04:21 The rest of the world is passing us by. They're all working together under the Paris agreement, and exploring alternatives, developing ways to reduce environmental impacts. Meanwhile here in the US we are digging and drilling for coal and oil, pulling back environmental safety.
4883 2018-01-17 14:04:07 As long as we focus on old fashioned energy methods, we will never be the dominant energy producer. Coal and oil are limited supplies, and the jobs are being taken away by corporate greed and new technology, not regulations. It's time to focus on renewable energy.
4884 2018-01-17 14:03:58 Stop the lobster madness. It’s not humane to boil them alive. Let’s boil humans in 400 degree peanut oil and then compare notes. Now who wants a piece of me on animal cruelty?

4990 2018-01-17 13:50:48 I thought they were relying on a thriving oil business? Oh yeah another lie that was historically recorded by their Independence White Paper.

5039 2018-01-17 13:44:02 Sir, I can tolerate, but can we use the same vessel used to boil say sesame oil and let's say ground nut oil?  You may call it to divide, but scientifically do we not use different vessels to cook and boil milk?  It for us to find which is milk and which is oil, isn't it?
5040 2018-01-17 13:43:53 Not surprised. Given this admins track record in climate change, big oil, coal etc why would we think that saving, enhancing or enlarging our national parks would be a priority?
5041 2018-01-17 13:43:49 Saudi Arabia just transferred $2 billion to Yemen to prop up their economy...don't care how much oil wealth they have, they'll run out fast with that kind of spending.

5126 2018-01-17 13:29:53 i would use the rose hip seed oil in the evening, it’s a little too greasy for day time imo! you apply them by adding a few drops to your fingers and then u press/pat the products into your skin, no rubbing like u maybe would with a heavy moisturizer!
5127 2018-01-17 13:29:35 If you find your suitcase needs a refresher, pour 20 drops of essential oil into a @Kleenex and toss it into your suitcase. It’ll smell so great the next time you use it! #aromatherapy #essentialoils #travel #oiltips #oilsoilsoils #essentialoils #wellness #naturalsolutions
5128 2018-01-17 13:29:19 nothing has been achieved regarding american foreign policy goals on north korea.  they still get oil from russia and china.  they are still developing nukes, chem weapons, bio weapons, and icbms.  all this does is further split s korea from america.  not good.

5136 2018-01-17 13:27:41 No they haven't.  They have said it wdnt be a problem.  Why would it be?  We r fully aligned, to the EU.  They would like to have 28 members again, rather than 27.  Our oceans of oil reserves wld mean we would be welcomed with open arms.  Our huge reserves of fish, whisky etc...

5208 2018-01-17 13:18:36 This is how the Trump Administration separates federal assets from their rightful owners - We the people. Now there is one less barrier to letting oil/gas/mining interests take the wheel - even in our treasured National Parks! #stolenland

5269 2018-01-17 13:09:02 Tea tree oil?? Acne patch?
5270 2018-01-17 13:08:50 It should have oil inside and a wick from the centre well (if there is one) or the lip, if memory serves. I know other old lamps better than this type, though, so don't trust me on where the wick is.
5271 2018-01-17 13:08:50 I just started using coconut oil as moisturizer at night and it’s amazing.
5272 2018-01-17 13:08:03 So Exciting

5274 2018-01-17 13:07:53 Socialism doesn't work bro..... The only reason it's working there temporarily is because it's sustained by huge oil supplies... when they dry up Norway will look like Haiti with snow
5275 2018-01-17 13:07:52 Get a handle on over priced oil . This will slow the US economy. $50-$60 is the sweet spot and our producers make money at these prices
5276 2018-01-17 13:07:06 Zinke was put there to undermine and sell off our National Parks to big oil, gas, mining, and timber. Looks like he is succeeding.
5277 2018-01-17 13:06:48 I met a man in the pub on Friday. A labourer on oil rigs. He had managed to turn 7k to 50k in 6 weeks.  I did think after that that now probably wasn’t a good time to take a punt.

5284 2018-01-17 13:05:09 Added! I can’t believe they are doing something so horrible by fiat, and then admitting the horribleness saying only Florida gets a pass.

5345 2018-01-17 12:58:32 CRUDE OIL

The current CONSUMPTION supply/demand price of Crude Oil is between $20-30 USD per barrel.

However, GAMBLING supply/demand price is right now $64 WTI.

Gambling Price can even go to $120, but when (not if) it drops, it goes to as low as $5-10, to bounce up again.
5346 2018-01-17 12:58:14 If someone offered my £10k for mine (it's alleged value) I would snap their hand off and deliver it in person....leaving it to cool down to mask the burnt oil smell first.

How does it taste?
I want to assume you dont need stew since you have added oil? Is this the case.
5396 2018-01-17 12:49:27 Ok, so why on a private road? You don't clean them or have responsibility for clearing the drains on them, so you should not be using them.

Can you also provide evidence that the water that was deposited contained no contaminants eg oil or fuel?

5402 2018-01-17 12:48:45 Honestly, it is THE BEST. Recipe is basically a red onion chopped, a handful of sundried tomatoes chopped both fried in olive oil, glug of balsamic vinegar (very important!) and basil and feta on top. It's so good, try it! x

5405 2018-01-17 12:48:04  It’s not my understanding that’s the problem.They were not oil! They were UK colonies.
The fact you can’t discern the difference is worrying,

5698 2018-01-17 11:57:09 If governments around world seriously decide to cut plastic use then this will hit oil demand... as oil use declines for energy, oil producers had hoped for increased demand from plastic manufacturing.

5705 2018-01-17 11:55:25 FYI your skin is greasy because you’re not moisturising - your skin is dry and overcompensating by producing too much oil. If you use a moisturiser it’ll stop being so greasy
5706 2018-01-17 11:55:17 8:00pm? Burning the midnight oil, eh Joel?
5707 2018-01-17 11:55:07 I just had some laying around, goes on easy as it’s an oil which they loved rather than a thick cream. Good luck.

5728 2018-01-17 11:51:16 I do indeed straighten it. Usually I just apply a heat protective spray of argon oil before using a flat iron, and then apply a little more by hand to the ends after and it's never been a problem.

5751 2018-01-17 11:48:46 Ugh. Readymade salad dressing is full of rubbish! All you need is good olive (or other) oil and vinegar, sometimes balsamic, and some nice fresh herbs and/or spices, and you're set. Easy-peasy.
5752 2018-01-17 11:48:39 8% is what scots are left with after Westminster takes 92%.The divided the oil and gas revenue by population so scots get 8% of their own resource.
Do you think England would ever accept a crap deal like that for itself?

5754 2018-01-17 11:48:30 The Middle East has some of the driest grounds, but under them they have one of the world’s greatest oil reserve. Don’t worry if you are going through dry times. God has put reserves in you that will make you greater than your present condition
5755 2018-01-17 11:48:17 Hiding out but got caught. Lots of cash in that area. No one likes banks who works in oil
5756 2018-01-17 11:48:08 The biggest businesses on the planet are Arms, Oil/Gas & Drugs, plus the banking/Finance that profits from the whole show. As a result, it’s no accident that Opium production in Afghanistan, a route for pipelines & destination for arms, has been at record levels nearly every year

5759 2018-01-17 11:47:55 De acuerdo. Aunque ha necesitado estirar un montón las variables claves (euro y oil) y aun así hoy en día necesita aun más, como tu bien dices la ruptura del 70 en Brent. Ambos escenarios posibles al final. Posiciones acá en cualquier dirección deben usar stops cerca.

5765 2018-01-17 11:47:05 I just hate every argument that is against the #kingsford campaign. There was no mention of green belt issues when they expanded Westhill, built Prime 4, built the park and ride, even all those new oil offices that were being constructed and now have been abandoned #Aurora
5766 2018-01-17 11:47:04 That’s just mean, yo. Now I crave their bread AND a giant saucer of oil.
5767 2018-01-17 11:47:04 @NalleliCobo "Turning Seawater into Electricity" by CBC News-New Brunswick, Canada, January 8, 2018 is about Joi Scientific that can compete against oil, coal and natural gas to produce zero pollution energy 24/7 or on demand. This is a major breakthrough that will impact us all.
5768 2018-01-17 11:46:55 What's the point? 200LR is still fuel guzzler and oil prices are headed North.
5769 2018-01-17 11:46:03 @WolfBearPig69 I don’t know but I feel oil will retrace and we should switch short... just saying

5776 2018-01-17 11:44:39 It's diesel, right? This will hurt other refiners. It won't necessarily weigh on oil prices.

5784 2018-01-17 11:42:59 Is the phone you tweet from made from wood & stone? Wondering how someone so opposed to oil is using Twitter when communication technology requires HUGE amounts of fossil fuels. I guess it's just ok to destroy other parts of the world for your tech? It has to come from somewhere

5801 2018-01-17 11:38:43 I did once own a Magna that had its own personal smokescreen from having shot piston rings. And a pretty awesome oil leak. And the brake booster was temperamental so somtimes the brake pedal was basically just a footrest. 

Box ticked.
5802 2018-01-17 11:38:35 Grab a few toilet seat covers to cut up into 2-inch squares. These are great for soaking up excess oil on your face.

I'm sick of hearing how skint Scotland is from people who take 92% of our wealth.

5810 2018-01-17 11:36:53 The implications should be immediate in functionality.  Rest of the old resources in Energy production should be stopped.

5817 2018-01-17 11:35:07 They stop it by getting into power. Starmer was a human rights lawyer he advised Helen Steel/David Morris in the McLibel case for free. He's a good man. Fox flies over to America to meet with (ALEC) Oil/Tobacco/NRA and they discuss how they can influence UK politics. Scary stuff.

5820 2018-01-17 11:34:40 oil. The same applies to the US. Russia certainly supported Trump, but it actually never expected or even wanted him to win. The Russian assumption was that Trump would lose, would not accept the result and cause no end of problems to the new US administration. Some of the best

5824 2018-01-17 11:34:01 Those who crack exams by burning mid-night oil are simply getting nothing except a few pennies.

5852 2018-01-17 11:27:05 Certainly no one has spilled the beans. The GOP is a rigidly hierarchical and conformist organization. They discipline apostasy. Big oil is behind the Tillerson choice and Tillerson is about Russo/American oil extraction in the Arctic. There is an “ergo” at work.

6114 2018-01-17 10:40:11 Rather my point. Countries do agree to trade ‘for free’ as you put it (look it up). If they cannot agree (or until they have agreed) a trade deal, there is the WTO. We would prefer a trade deal (rather than WTO terms) so we have agreed a one-off payment of £40m to oil the wheels.
6115 2018-01-17 10:40:10 A vast majority of paraffinic base oil producers have announced price increases, ranging 10-22 cents per gallon, with implementation dates between Jan. 5 and Jan. 31. The initiatives were said to be driven by high crude oil costs and balanced-to-tight supply. No increases on GIII

6130 2018-01-17 10:38:19 The gold back yuan being used to pay for oil is taking over from the petrodollar backed by thin air. All the US can offer in  return is sanctions and the threat of war. Russia doubled oil exports to China to 600,000 a day. More on the way. Sanctions not working out!

Maybe when theyre stripping away healthcare? Harassing homeless people? Locking up PoC? Invading countries for oil? Jacking up house prices? Militarising cops? Bombing abortion clinics?
Just because they use the state doesnt mean its not violence

6381 2018-01-17 09:56:47 agree with that. also needs a very solid story & BOD behind any investment.  certainly no oil drills spuds etc.
6382 2018-01-17 09:56:35 would in the US or EU price manipulation of basic necessities like crude oil by a known Kartel be accepted? no there are stiff jail sentences for a crime like this.
6383 2018-01-17 09:56:29 Ironic indeed as facts on the ground clearly show its UK that engineered the war in the first place or rather its oil firms did
6384 2018-01-17 09:56:26 Brilliant work @Adrianwfire .. top post. Q. Why start any construction work if there's no oil? As you say, it's coming for sure. This will be a production well this time next year. #ukog #BroadfordBridge @ContrarianShare @Anton13579 @WealdOilers #oil

6389 2018-01-17 09:55:29 mike,  you must research;  dont peddle this poison.   do you know how much oil is used to dig these ''rare earth metals'' these non renewable s out of earth?  are you obtuse or an oil co. shill?

However a chunk of this growth is oil driven which means less jobs. Is the Dutch disease setting in? #MornigStarr #AskNana

6432 2018-01-17 09:46:40 Probably, larger 2018 budget, yes. Since oil price is up. But they may be overestimating, since oil production is falling... Also , domestic revenue collection has been systematically overestimated for years.
6433 2018-01-17 09:46:33 Dead skin cells of the body can be removed by applying mixture of olive oil and salt. Replacing salt with granulated sugar can work too.

6543 2018-01-17 09:26:50 Rose Garr, policy director at Mighty Earth. “RFS was intended to clean up our transportation sector, but instead it’s subsidizing fuels that are even dirtier than oil." “This appears to be a case where the left-hand claims to be clean while the right is in it up to its elbow”
6544 2018-01-17 09:26:17 ofc a lot has changed in this field. Combat proven APS (Trophy), ultimate man operated ATGM(Spike NLOS, French MMP) and fire&forget Javelin, sensor fusion etc had emerged in the West, while Russia still shine at old generation systems like Kornet, RPGs, snake oil Shtora
6545 2018-01-17 09:26:07 That's because the best dressing is just a vinegar and a good olive oil. + salt and pepper.

Putin never diversified the economy so Russia is a global leader in nothing.

6576 2018-01-17 09:19:40 Right, but our hubris, condescension & greed played their part: We let them away with the lies & fake narratives bc in our hearts we always "knew" we were "superior." We could afford to humour them. And, we had given them sovereignty over the largest oil fields on the planet.

6666 2018-01-17 08:54:56 I don’t know if it’s a coincidence but lavender oil on my pillow and breathing that in all night. Has given me the best nights sleep in so long.
6667 2018-01-17 08:54:53 I just went through this in November! Get some clove oil if you can in the meantime! It’s the only thing that works from experience!
6668 2018-01-17 08:54:06 Norway's modern manufacturing and welfare system relies on financial reserves produced by exploitation of natural resourcesparticularly North Sea oil. It has a rare GDP per capita above US$70,000!

6670 2018-01-17 08:53:12 Then If you live in a colder state and burn electric heat when it cold out keep your butt warm .You can use that mining rig as a heater .which in turn offsets your power costs than running plain old electric heaters or oil or some places fire wood where the price per cord is nuts

6672 2018-01-17 08:52:40 Interesting results from @DrMichaelMosley.  Coconut oil does ‘seem’ to be a healthy fat (qualifications apply) and it doesn’t matter when you eat carbs as long as you don’t od on added sugar.   @BBCTrustMe

6686 2018-01-17 08:48:19 Oil hovering around $70 a barrel. The highest level for 3 years means @hmtreasury is enjoying increased VAT revenue on rocketing pump prices including the VAT on the highest fuel duty in the world. Where is this windfall money going? Not back into roads & potholes! @HowardCCox
6687 2018-01-17 08:48:17 Plus pasta is just flour and maybe egg. Bread has salt and often oil in, potatoes with no oil or salt are nonsense. Pasta with oil or butter and salt is good. So no you’re completely wrong

7237 2018-01-17 06:48:26 To say all the time that people here are paid is nonsense. I can say that about you too. The boycott movement is costing billions of dollars and is financed by a Muslim lobby rich in oil. But there are people who defend the truth from its distortion

7239 2018-01-17 06:47:48 Has anyone here tried high quality butter oil & cod liver oil? I know the taste can't be pleasant but the benefits from them are what's drawing me in, Any opinions?
7240 2018-01-17 06:47:45 There was a big reason behind that brother.
If we would have voted in favour of them, then other oil nation could have been against us.

7266 2018-01-17 06:41:46 The only good intentions were that they stole all the resources from Iraq and Libya. Two countries that contain huge amount of oil... and other political reasons. Such as the strong army that Iraq had. Which threatened Israel (mother of US) and other gulf countries.

7394 2018-01-17 06:19:39 should probably be more concerned with the carbs than than oil tbh
7395 2018-01-17 06:19:34 Decreased prices of fuel will create more problems for our country.
1.decreased price increases consumption increasing air pollution.
2.increased consumption increases import creating economic crisis.
3.increased dependence on oil exporting countries compromising foreign policy.

7408 2018-01-17 06:18:33 Gotta feel good while using a natural oil hair mask remedy.  Put my hair in a cute bun to look good, so it don't look too oily aha 
7409 2018-01-17 06:18:30 Yeah! That was some good news this Sunday!.. fantastic news. So sad about the environmental disaster in the South China Sea Leo. Oil tanker on fire & spilling gallons of oil into the ocean. What do you think the long term environmental impact will be like? It’s hard to say.
7410 2018-01-17 06:18:30 Trust me, they won't. What's going to happen is that, just as with our so-called ex-militants in our oil rich south who made a living thru hostage-taking, gov is going to pay them off regularly NOT to re-offend. And the 'deradicalized' will use that as a means to extort gov.

7416 2018-01-17 06:17:39 Obviously you're never giving up on that whole assumption thing I pointed out. I already know abt this, & it could still be used as a model for how *not* to run a program. How familiar are you w oil subsidies & what little accountability there is?

7479 2018-01-17 06:06:34 What sort of connection is it between Norway & Netherlands? I'd imagine that is gas, or oil, from Norway. Gas/oil pipes are not inefficient, but France doesn't have cheap gas or oil to send to Ireland.

We mostly meddle in the Middle East and South America. We usually don't care much about Africa, except Libya and Egypt.

7516 2018-01-17 05:59:10 I think it’s a sign from Earth’s energy for me to not be petty even tho I was about to be when tea tree oil dropped into my eyes
7517 2018-01-17 05:58:51 The KRG now has a chance at a post-oil future, and some KRG leaders are actually relieved that this is the case. They know that oil wealth generally does not make accountable governments, or jobs, or stable economies.

7519 2018-01-17 05:58:25 2594 oil blow out update. Drained oil and had one gallon left. My mechanic wants me to bring it in. Hoping we can get through planting then maybe do an overhaul on it. Has 6000 hours.

7531 2018-01-17 05:56:09 I think for a lot of people, it's easier to accept a flashy lie - that billions of dollars went missing - than to accept the far tougher truth: that the billions did not exist, and that KRG was hand-to-mouth, desperately fighting 4 current account balance even with Kirkuk oil.
7532 2018-01-17 05:55:56 But why were you rubbing lavender oil on your feet in the beginning tho

7561 2018-01-17 05:49:47 shower oil!!! seriously though, getting a nice oil & applying all over in the shower can really help you retain moisture. i do this right before i get out and my towel soaks up any excess. i get a light oil so i can do my face too.

7580 2018-01-17 05:46:27 Imports are expected to make up more than 70 percent of China's crude oil supply in 2018, meaning China overtook the United States to…
7581 2018-01-17 05:46:25 Okay, but what if the oil is cold? What if the oil is pressed from the virgin spleens of free range gummi bears? What if we just eat the damn pizza because it's delicious and we aren't controlled by a paralyzing fear of faaaat?

7584 2018-01-17 05:45:57 I hope this new oil helps with my stretch marks. And I got them from my lovely health issue okay? They make me feel like a zebra.
7585 2018-01-17 05:45:36 Best way to do it is the simplest way...cut in half, toss with olive oil, salt, pepper and a little garlic powder.  Put oven on 375 and bake for about 30 min,with the flat side of the Brussels down.  They’re good when nice and crispy.  They may look burnt a bit but that’s good!
7586 2018-01-17 05:45:29 Seems like he is trying to convert rural voters and then count on a big democrat turnout in the larger cities. He’ll face a tougher campaign if people feel the benefit of tax reform and see that Beto would work against the oil industry.

7594 2018-01-17 05:44:19 Tea tree oil!!! It's a keloid. Buy some tea tree oil, put a lil on a qtip, and dab it straight onto the bump twice a day and it'll go away within a week or so. The tea tree oil dries it out and shrinks it! Try not to put makeup on it until it's gone.
7595 2018-01-17 05:44:07 My life has changed ever since I started shaving with coconut oil

7627 2018-01-17 05:38:26 I made a pretty decent mug cake with almond flour and coconut oil. Since I had string cheese and sugar free pudding for dinner, this should get me through the night.
7628 2018-01-17 05:38:24 I mixed my raw shea butter with coconut oil and added a drop of lavender. It’s almost bearable. ALMOST but my skin would be white and cracked without it. 
7629 2018-01-17 05:38:18 Lavender and frankincense for relaxation. Eucalyptus, peppermint, tea tree oil will open up your breathing and just smell good.

7666 2018-01-17 05:33:49 Day 16: I went food shopping and got an oil change in under an hour today. That’s gotta be a record of some sort.
7667 2018-01-17 05:33:32 yet loves them enough to let them distract you from school  they have oil if they don’t make it but if you fail it’s game over for you lmfaooo 
7668 2018-01-17 05:33:27 The flour was on the counter beside the toaster. I know bread is basically flour, but the toaster is for baked flour, not unbaked flour, silly.

I ended up browning garlic in oil and butter, added onions, added flour, Then added cream. And put that layering w/ scalloped potatoes!
7669 2018-01-17 05:33:24 Can someone recommend me some good oils for an oil diffuser? Thanks in advance
7670 2018-01-17 05:33:23 At minimum the answer is "I dabbed a miniscule bit of the oil off so I can eat it now."
7671 2018-01-17 05:33:18 #RelianceIndustries has declared a 30 percent increase in the installed capacity of its export-focused oil refinery.
7672 2018-01-17 05:32:45 Honestly CBD oil has changed my life dramatically. My anxiety is so much more manageable without taking any kind of benzo medication.
7673 2018-01-17 05:32:36 How to get blocked by a MLA: Point out the fact that diversified economies include Resource Industries. Facts shattered MLA Kevin O’Reilly’s dreams of an anti-development “Sorry not mining or oil and gas” economy so he blocked me. #nwtpoli @james_oconnor @kevinframelake

7677 2018-01-17 05:32:06 I do understand your point about needing ME allies, but honestly we shouldn't be as close with any of the Gulf states as we are until their human rights records improve. If it wasn't for oil and Iran, our presidents wouldn't have been bowing to Saudi dictators for decades.
7678 2018-01-17 05:32:05 The “Pie-in-the-sky” comment was just the politicians way of obfuscating the healthcare issue and confusing the electorate. Villaraigosa you should be ashamed of yourself. Your just selling snake oil and hot air.

7682 2018-01-17 05:31:29 If I knew it was this easy to scam y’all I would’ve been bought some coconut oil mixed it with some water & sold it in a 2 oz bottle for $50 & claimed it cleared my genetically pimple free skin too. 
7683 2018-01-17 05:31:29 He is a snake oil salesman.  A paper tiger of a leader.  All politicians have a certain amount of BS but this turd just oozes it 24/7.  Sadly, it disturbs me that his approval % is as high as it is.  Come on my fellow Canadians, be better!
7684 2018-01-17 05:31:22 A couple of years ago, maybe a little longer or a little less time ago, there were LDS ads all over YouTube. I don't want any religious ads on my content. I don't want any Monsanto ads or oil company ads or any of that kind of crap. I should have a say. And it wasn't that long

7697 2018-01-17 05:29:42 Car companies did that. LA has horrible public transit because of oil (and the refining of oil and plastics into graded rubber and plastic products)
7698 2018-01-17 05:29:32 They cannot last long without stealing our tax dollars.  Also, since they won’t drill their own oil, let’s see how long they can last!

7805 2018-01-17 05:11:26 On my complex it is those elderly who walk around trying to find fault like wrong parking, smell of cooking oil during cooking. There is no resting with these old guards. They seem like that’s all they do to excite their lives
7806 2018-01-17 05:11:23 Love falling asleep to the smell of Thieves oil... :) #bliss #YoungLiving #thieves

7819 2018-01-17 05:09:56 Drinking the oil actually sounds pretty good too.
7820 2018-01-17 05:09:35 Stop pumping oil & encouraging car use? It's not that hard!
7821 2018-01-17 05:09:35 Oil prices edge up on tighter supplies, healthy demand.
7822 2018-01-17 05:09:32 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.

7824 2018-01-17 05:09:08 Ahhh you’re probably right. I often forget “hot pan/cold oil”
7825 2018-01-17 05:09:08 Mr. President, solving the problem of Palestinian refugees is by persuading Australia, Canada and Europe to absorb them in batches and with funding from the Arab oil countries and not to deprive the poor of aid.
7826 2018-01-17 05:09:06 Got out the shower, drenched myself in coconut oil lotion & massaged my legs and ASS. I FEEL GOOD
7827 2018-01-17 05:08:49 Running out of easily extracted oil -- fracking for more will increase price and impact environment.  If we burn all the oil we can extract, we'll have a climate catastrophe.  Moral-- go for more renewable energy.
7828 2018-01-17 05:08:47 IF they provide cheap necessities without producing greater harms. Cost/benefit concerns should be accounted in. Making oil barons richer isn’t justification enough.
7829 2018-01-17 05:08:29 Mineral oil....when spilled a tad on your hands, can make the extra large economy bottle slick to hold onto. Sounds like a wise investment to make.
7830 2018-01-17 05:08:22 I need to stop accidentally spilling so much vitamin e oil
7831 2018-01-17 05:08:19 Hint: it’s not drilling for oil off our coasts.

7838 2018-01-17 05:07:50 Kerrygold butter + coconut oil and a splash of heavy whipping cream in morning coffee is a zero carb keto beverage made in heaven. Good luck brother.
7839 2018-01-17 05:07:36 Texas doesn't charge taxes, because the state makes a fortune off of oil revenues. Any military troop who has been stationed in Texas can tell you that. While in the military even after I left Texas,  I still used Texas as my home state for years to avoid paying state income tax.
7840 2018-01-17 05:07:29 Yes mustard oil is best. Will try aataa and daal!

7853 2018-01-17 05:04:28 Uh. They’ve included Midnight Oil and Yothu Yindi. I have questions.
7854 2018-01-17 05:04:16 Rosemary oil is very great for your hair
7855 2018-01-17 05:04:10 Sitting at the bar by my lonestar self listening to these investment advisors and mutual fund managers talk about how bullish they are on oil. LOL. Maybe. But if not, I’m going to ram z/z down your throats so fucking hard.

7859 2018-01-17 05:03:21 My proudest moment of 2018 so far is talking a (white) girl out of buying some expensive coconut oil in Sephora. Told her to go to Costco instead.
7860 2018-01-17 05:03:19 The U.S. was required to reveal all the revenue it received from oil, gas and mining companies, and required those companies to publicly disclose the payments they make to the U.S. and other governments. But tRump has just ended this. What payments is he trying to hide?
7861 2018-01-17 05:03:10 But don't you know? Anyone or anything who does not follow the Green Gods fanatical hate for humans ,are all working for Big Oil!
7862 2018-01-17 05:03:03 Shipping billions of liters of oil up the st Lawrence sea way only makes sense if your virtue signaling to the tune of 100 000s of Alberta jobs while you enjoy a free child care etc.

7876 2018-01-17 05:01:05 Question. If olive oil is made out of olives, what baby oil made of?...
7877 2018-01-17 05:00:52 It is day one of school and I’m already so exhausted that I just put hair oil on my face

7879 2018-01-17 05:00:43 Oh, absolutely. We sort of developed a taste for the alternatives (coconut oil instead of butter for cooking, almond milk, etc), just because we knew we’d have to do SOMETHING since cold turkey wasn’t an option.
7880 2018-01-17 05:00:40 Just did a natural aloe hydration mask from aloe leaves I purchased today followed by apple cider vinegar and tea tree oil as a toner to restores the PH of your skin. My face feels like a baby's bum. 
7881 2018-01-17 05:00:28 Like a vampire, he drinks oil out of robots.

7895 2018-01-17 04:59:13 Sam have you been able to find Lipidol recently? Apparently they’re rethinking their formula/brand etc and all stocks are off the shelves. I miss their shower oil...
7896 2018-01-17 04:59:12 ok but what is it really?? oil or something? water? who puts water in pancakes? i’m distraught
7897 2018-01-17 04:59:11 My @BahiCosmetics  sunflower sweets oil just did a 360 spin off the stop shelf of my cabinet bounced off the sink and landed on the floor. And I screamed like a 5 year old because I just knew it was going to shatter into a gazillion pieces. We good tho.

7902 2018-01-17 04:57:43 How do you guys feel about coconut oil for skin care?? I'm fairly new at using it and I'm not sure how I feel about it yet.
7903 2018-01-17 04:57:40 Bothers me when i see people using essential oils and diffusers that they buy from amazon or other random stores. Do you know what is in them?? Only 5% of the product has to be the pure essential oil to be considered one, the rest WHATEVER they want..... C-H-E-M-I-C-A-L-S!!!!!!
7904 2018-01-17 04:57:31 I’ve been using vitamin E oil for my dark circles and it’s been helping a lot!

7914 2018-01-17 04:56:13 Everyone knows you don't form a new state or country on land. You find a defunct oil rig out on the ocean and claim it. International waters, yo.
7915 2018-01-17 04:56:13 I thought this was just common knowledge....

Does no one else stick a straw in their pizza and drink it like an oil flavored milkshake?
7916 2018-01-17 04:56:07 That’s been going on for a whole long time. For the last 40 years in fact. Fact is: they had oil. We needed oil. Any questions?

7920 2018-01-17 04:55:46 Hi! My dad has Parkinson's and his neurologist recommends (among other things) that he ingest 6 tablespoons of coconut oil a day. Your factoid is food shaming, fat shaming, and not helpful for most people.

7942 2018-01-17 04:51:10 All because coconut oil is highly fatty and absorbing all that is like super moisturiser to your charred and dry skin. EXCELLENT.
7943 2018-01-17 04:51:09 the puppy acne? yeah. that’s the “skin condition” the last vet “diagnosed”. she has a metal water and food dish cleaned regularly. wash toys too. and wash face daily/treat w/coconut oil or espree tea tree/aloe spray. she just has my skin. lol

7947 2018-01-17 04:50:36 Does it smell like pine oil cause I heard the gas smells like it
7948 2018-01-17 04:50:32 I don’t know what to believe anymore. I went to Sephora and entertained one of the employees there who recommended this hair oil. She had long hair but it was neither kinky nor coily.
7949 2018-01-17 04:50:24 The idea is to collect revenue from the aam aadmi for everything that was never taxed before ! The govt's plan to exploit the poor to pay for their profligacy and incompetence ! The lakhs of crores saved on account of low oil prices was neither passed on to the consumer or saved!
7950 2018-01-17 04:50:22 Irrelevant. Try real News like drilling down on #FusionGPS. Your ratings depend on it. Snake oil sales lose in the long run. I’d like to say your better than this but....I can’t.
7951 2018-01-17 04:50:04 That extra virgin coconut oil a foo man, best shit ever
7952 2018-01-17 04:49:55 Cold compress/submerge burn in cold water until the skin cools, then layer that shit on like you're greasing up to slide down a hill. Cooking coconut oil works a treat, and is way cheaper.

7959 2018-01-17 04:48:59 No it was. I was just seeing the chart setup. But I know it's up on oil news. With that said it it hit 37cents tomorrow I wouldn't cry about it.
7960 2018-01-17 04:48:53 Blessed are those who kindly inform their partners that olive oil is not a moisturizer, but that the moisturizer must be water based then sealed with an oil.
7961 2018-01-17 04:48:49 “Eating pizza is like eating a spoonful of oil!” Well strap the fuck in because we’re about to be Exxon Valdez in this bitch.

7963 2018-01-17 04:48:31 I could go for some warm oil.

7966 2018-01-17 04:48:02 Well I've been using Lipidol (created by the same people that do Bio) and it's incredible my results. I only use it at night (they have a night oil). Doesn't using it in the day make your skin oily?
7967 2018-01-17 04:47:59 With all this opposition to being near new oil wells do you ever wonder why people pay top dollar to live in Signal Hill? I do.
7968 2018-01-17 04:47:59 Both countries were invaded by the u.s. for their resources, oil & gold.  Also wars generate more money for the world's largest industry: arms & armaments.  It's never about spreading democracy. It's about $$$ & control. We failed in both,  just like in Vietnam.
7969 2018-01-17 04:47:58 Trump and his cronies don't see beauty in our national parks...they only see big dollar signs for Big Oil and Big Coal.

7973 2018-01-17 04:46:59 Also, 2L of oil every 3000km. I didn't realise they were still making the RX8 in 2013
7974 2018-01-17 04:46:56 Sounds like the people consuming the products and services made possible by oil have some explaining to do....

7984 2018-01-17 04:45:27 Definitely RT @_leighaaaa: I feel like part of adulting is finding a good deal on an oil change. Idk. That's just me
7985 2018-01-17 04:45:26 Pizza sounds much more enjoyable than just drinking the oil
7986 2018-01-17 04:45:21 Why is CNN promoting a building built from oil money? Being a Muslim nation now gets you a pass from CNN’s Climate Change crusade. It’s amazing to see the lack of consistency in MSM but maybe the consistency is being inconsistent. #MAGA

7988 2018-01-17 04:45:05 I want pizza even more now to get the imagined taste of three spoons of oil out of my mouth.

7997 2018-01-17 04:44:10 Leadership? Please. This is excessive overacting for political gain. You can’t be so out of touch that you’re sold his snake oil emotion.
7998 2018-01-17 04:43:40 Honestly, I do oil changes (and not synthetic or high mileage, just regular oil) every 7,500 miles (rarely less, sometimes I wait as long as 10,000 miles) never flush fluids and change your air filter annually. That’s it. Followed those with all three and it works like a charm.

8001 2018-01-17 04:43:31 I'm a novice but as the election approaches, tensions will run high and probably rhetorical will be thrown around that can affect the market. The budget, oil prices, micro and macro economic indices and the 2nd half (maybe 3rd quarter) of the year will see a swing in the narkey
8002 2018-01-17 04:43:30 Yet demand for oil continues to increase.  Do you think the issue is the supplier or the consumer?
8003 2018-01-17 04:43:28 My undereyes were very dry so I put oil on it & now I can’t see hey Twitter

8014 2018-01-17 04:41:58 so dam good start with oil n fresh mince garlic then add tomatoes n spices & sautéed mushroom n simmer for a while then basil n sausage. absolutely scrumptious.

8064 2018-01-17 04:34:51 What I don’t get is why it’s warm oil, specifically. How is it not also three spoons of cold oil?

8099 2018-01-17 04:29:12 I wouldn't be happy with that. They just gave big oil a 20 billion dollar handout to develop another tarsand project. So much for commitment to Paris Accord.

8102 2018-01-17 04:29:01 I mostly don’t eat grains but I do love kale! I’ll usually steam it lightly or marinate it in salads to soften it up. I do a lot of spinach salads & green smoothies (spinach, banana, protein powder, coconut oil is one example)

8126 2018-01-17 04:25:51 well how many spoons of oil does it take to fill me up? probably a lot more than three. if i'm going to eat one of those things, i'd rather eat the pizza.

8292 2018-01-17 04:01:31 That scene where buddy drinks a quart of oil before arm wrestling is cinema gold
8293 2018-01-17 04:01:22 LRT: unfortunately any of the Nakamura tracks (Green Hill, Chemical Plant, Oil Ocean) aren’t on this album :(
8294 2018-01-17 04:01:03 I think everyone should sleep with an oil diffuser on 
8295 2018-01-17 04:00:47 Oil of cloves is reliably known to reduce the pain of toothache. Dab it on directly and it will numb it for a bit. Good luck!
8296 2018-01-17 04:00:41 Im doing dope math with my daily cannabis oil tolerance of 3 grams vs. the average recreational cannabis edible of 10 mg per serving. 

My daily disease, pain and suffering is equal to 300 people. 

300 healthy non dying people x 10mg cannabis oil = 3 grams of pain free me:) 
8297 2018-01-17 04:00:36 You, have Iran coming into the market Now !! Russia pouring oil into the market too ... Other countries are pushing there oil too ..

An essential oil diffuser shows up. I know this may actually benefit more so I don’t mind. I’m a chemist last night creating perfect “sleep easy and make my throat feel better” mist.

End of war is the end of tax.
8324 2018-01-17 03:57:34 This is oil paint and I’m using a mixture of gamblin & galkyd which makes the paint run smooth
8325 2018-01-17 03:57:30 Don't let that good oil go to waste...I mean, what do you think crusts are for?
8326 2018-01-17 03:57:11 All employees were required to bring their own water and a oil lantern to work to save on hydro

8330 2018-01-17 03:56:30 Do I need to find some links about what sleep deprivation does to your brain ?
You are are good kid, but 6-7 hours is minimum for most of us. Less, and we start thinking slow and making mistakes. Oil, butter and most real fats are good for the brain, but sleep essential.
8331 2018-01-17 03:56:13 If it’s really good pizza, we wipe up some of the oil with a napkin first.
8332 2018-01-17 03:56:07 Law is confusing.. I’ve been helping Chloe with her homework all night. I’m burning the midnight oil right now. I feel old/stupid. Ugh.

8334 2018-01-17 03:55:53 The Paris Climate Accord mean ANYTHING to you? Opening up National parks & wildlife refuge areas to drill for oil and level thousands of acres for timber money! Trying to get rid of the EPA! His endorsement for hunting exotic & endangered animals! That enough for ya?
8335 2018-01-17 03:55:30 Holy shit.

8350 2018-01-17 03:53:27 Are the spoons of oil garlic and pepperoni flavored? I think fucking not.

8351 2018-01-17 03:53:19 Meanwhile. Anyone seen the oil price?  #shouldawouldacoulda

8378 2018-01-17 03:48:40 Wakili, the billing was reworked during the 8hour long black out...that extra is now pushed by ERC in the oil sector
8379 2018-01-17 03:48:27 Oil. SA dominates. USA influences. Oil pipelines are what many wars as skirmishes start over. Think “keystone” pipeline. Maybe the Keystone is oil (OPEC/SA)?

8389 2018-01-17 03:46:47 You know you’re an anxious and stressed mess when your boyfriend buys you an essential oil diffuser and your work wife buys you a Himalayan pink salt lamp. Lmao
8390 2018-01-17 03:46:38 also on another note my mother attempted to microwave coconut oil so i opened it just now to smell burnt plastic and a black smear
8391 2018-01-17 03:46:22 Yup and coconut oil, and salt so yeah maybe a couple bags of this a week if your counting.
8392 2018-01-17 03:46:12 When you are a good natural today and you wash, detangle, oil and twist up your hair :)

8397 2018-01-17 03:45:28 You can also, just use a blotting paper, to absorb the oil. I SOMETIMES just use a Kleenex. Works, helps to keep makeup in place, if use  a base or foundation.
8398 2018-01-17 03:45:27 Besides all the religious/exercise-so-you-get-tired remedies, you can also try getting lavendar oil and like rub it in your palms and just breathe it in, apparently it helps with calming the mind hence falling asleep 
8399 2018-01-17 03:45:21 Yep you would think, probably want us to pay for all the TSN channels lol
8400 2018-01-17 03:45:13 Yes because warm oil doesn't come in pepperoni flavor.

Over my dead body.
8408 2018-01-17 03:44:02 He did many things. Kept black unemployment high by not letting the economy rebound quickly, and increased racial tensions, just to name two. Wherever there was tension between black lives and blue lives, Obama made sure to pour oil over the flames of antagonism.
8409 2018-01-17 03:44:00 Doesn't sound bad 3spoons of oil. Compare to Garri, that puts you to sleep when done.
8410 2018-01-17 03:43:54 Yeah but TSN has always made a Canadian headliner their priority...really is bizarre.
8411 2018-01-17 03:43:50 Sustainable city commissioner highlights that many who have spoken in favor of plan have also donated money to council members, including oil companies.
8412 2018-01-17 03:43:47 Fish oil!!!
8413 2018-01-17 03:43:45 ... that and about 40 years ... a very poor comparison ... I must say ...

8423 2018-01-17 03:42:07 Flight can be solved with #Algae which can be made into crude oil and then Jet Fuel. Leave the fossils for the next civilization to find. #LFTR would be best however for everything else.

8428 2018-01-17 03:40:39 I wonder how many of them consume coconut oil, too. Or if they think about how much oil/fat is in avocados.

8440 2018-01-17 03:38:33 @benshapiro Trumps policies offer tens of thousands of forgotten inner city youth good jobs, revitalize urban cities, make the petroleum of the war-torn Persian Gulf irrelevant to an oil rich USA.. But Democrats would rather flush all that because.... their candidate didn’t win.
8441 2018-01-17 03:38:23 Only oil I get in the last 3 months is the Lil bit I squeeze out the fish cakes
8442 2018-01-17 03:38:19 People think only black guys appreciate a big butt.... it's not true at all lol your non black faves would love to pour warm oil and wax all over this

8451 2018-01-17 03:36:14 I've been using tea tree oil cleanser for two weeks, but my skin worsen. Especially at T-zone. Whitehead & acne everywhere

8456 2018-01-17 03:35:44 I take ours in. We found a place that does a full car wash, inside and out for free if you buy an oil change. It’s like $35 total so it’s worth t to me. I don’t have the supplies or space to do it myself
8457 2018-01-17 03:35:37 ine really wan lighten, i'll try it but pass on the lemon... baking soda and coconut oil mask pretty hype too
8458 2018-01-17 03:35:35 NYC Douchebros and their "culture" entered SV (and to a slightly lesser extent, SF) immediately after Bear Stearns collapsed.

Cushy jobs with 7 digit bonuses left NY, and the pricks who only smell money left with them.  I wish they'd gone to the North Dakota oil fields, though.
8459 2018-01-17 03:35:22 When black panther come out I wanna be in a movie theater that smell like oil sheen and Newport’s.....I want people yelling at the screen and somebody bootlegging it wit a DSLR. I want the blackest experience possible. Imma bring my Snacks in a Hermès Bag
8460 2018-01-17 03:35:22 When I was a kid my dream 
was to live on a big blue oil rig.
8461 2018-01-17 03:35:03 Hell yes, especially seeing as the white man doesn’t seem to be able to keep their words when it comes to treaties. When we like them sure they are great but hey man you have oil and well, we want it so We’re taking it.
8462 2018-01-17 03:34:49 @GameSenseSports has revolutionized #PitchRecognition with their software. Unlike anything out there, and backed by scientific research. Lots of snake oil salesmen out there, but this this #legit. Don’t get fooled, get GameSenseSports.
8463 2018-01-17 03:34:36 I’d die for buddy & leave a caretaker in my will to wipe that good boy with lavender oil.

8470 2018-01-17 03:34:02 Nothing like a hot steam shower and some coconut oil on your skin
8471 2018-01-17 03:34:02 Welcome to the Political Hillbillies. 
Starring Trump and the Tater Tots.
Co-starring Kellyanne Conway as Granny. 
This sh*t show was brought to you by oil baby, Texas Tea, Black Gold!
8472 2018-01-17 03:33:47 His name is buddy. He has anxiety and has to be rubbed with lavender oil twice a day but he’s the most loyal sweet boy ever 
8473 2018-01-17 03:33:43 Bruh, my new beard trimmer and beard products (comb, balm, & oil) came in and my beard is hella soft now and smells really good.

8476 2018-01-17 03:33:40 Yelpers are raving about our sustainably farmed nutmeg kale with spicy tuna oil!
8477 2018-01-17 03:33:40 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. New York City sleeps.
8478 2018-01-17 03:33:40 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
8479 2018-01-17 03:33:27 Have seen the debate US President Trump wants immigration from countries like Norway.

8487 2018-01-17 03:32:38 People of native heritage largely against the oil/restoration deal, business interests in favor. No surprises there.
8488 2018-01-17 03:32:11 i love my essential oil diffuser

8493 2018-01-17 03:31:47 I think thick sliced roasted red cabbage with chili oil is my new favorite food.
8494 2018-01-17 03:31:46 Norway was a poor country post WW2. Oil was discovered off shore; they drilled for it--didn't ban off-shore drilling. This brought wealth. They invested prudently & it benefited the whole economy. The small population makes it hard to compare to the US.(abt. the pop. of Oregon).

8507 2018-01-17 03:28:47 that one expert must be getting a big check from the oil industries.
8508 2018-01-17 03:28:38 @LakersTalkESPN Allen think of it like a car.The most important parts are working brakes, oil & steering etc... The best part of the car is the engine(subjectively). MJ was the best player on those bulls, Scottie was most important.
8509 2018-01-17 03:28:34 To be fair the basic education was the funding rhetoric from Aunty Hekia... 'We will find reading writing and maths.' Basic art - crayons or Clay, chalk pastels or oil.
8510 2018-01-17 03:28:25 . . . Which means less profits for gas and oil companies and layoffs of workers from these companies. Perhaps you should do some research on the economy and how little influence a president has on it.

8516 2018-01-17 03:27:34 Haha! Thanks. Hey does anyone here use CBD Oil? It's pot without the getting high part but is good for pain. I know, I know....why am I bothering to not use the real stuff in Oregon?
8517 2018-01-17 03:27:18 How is “using truffle oil” and “aerator fail” not on this list?
8518 2018-01-17 03:27:03 I want a candle the scent of an old cedar cigar box and linseed oil.

8521 2018-01-17 03:26:54 This economy is fueled by oil. Ordering pizza is the patriotic thing to do.
8522 2018-01-17 03:26:53 My response to Liz Cheney complaining about the "burdensome regulations on coal and oil": This is a very short-sighted, narrow-minded and unenlightened view.  I hope you wake up to realize there can still be a free market,while honoring and assisting the Whole.
8523 2018-01-17 03:26:51 Gee, I just read something that said a slice of pizza is like having three tablespoons of warm oil.
8524 2018-01-17 03:26:32 Do you happen to know any people who work in a coal mine, an oil refinery, or a waste waste treatment facility? I can assure you that these and many other such dirty and dangerous jobs are performed primarily by men.

She was not a Nazi and no one in her family had been--they made up a lot of lies to

8558 2018-01-17 03:22:03 You're welcome!  it also helps to put oil on your ends after washing your hair. As for supplements: Biotin is a common used vitamin and the herb Horsetail  
8559 2018-01-17 03:21:57 I honestly wonder where they get this info. Sure, some are greasy or oily, but it’s not 3 cups or whatever of oil
8560 2018-01-17 03:21:54 I think that renewables wedge is awesome.  Complaining about nuclear demise are misplaced-- you should complain about the lack of R&D in safer N designs- oil companies are awash in cash flow yet they spend it on politicians and lawyers, not energy innovation; you know it's true.

We have oil. 

We win. #SorryNotSorry

8572 2018-01-17 03:20:46 Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has asked the government for inclusion of oil and natural gas in the new (GST) regime.
8573 2018-01-17 03:20:42 I got an idea, why don't you just quit buying oil based products???
8574 2018-01-17 03:20:18 New California has the farmland, oil, pristine coasts, mineral wealth,  all the weed, all the nature, and all the waterways. Old CA has hollywood, tourism and software. Making a new state would be great, peace out silicon valley and hollywood elitists, enjoy the coming tax hike!
8575 2018-01-17 03:20:18 Haha! I love roasted fennel with salt and pepper and olive oil. But then again, I love everything except cilantro. Cilantro is Of The Devil.
8576 2018-01-17 03:20:07 //Btw if any of you guys are under stress, get a bottle of neroli oil. It comes from the blossoms of bitter orange trees and it helps aid in relaxation.

8579 2018-01-17 03:19:44 Pfft. Truffle oil is missing.
8580 2018-01-17 03:19:43 I've written about this annual report many times for various media and never for a Canadian publication.  Meanwhile the oil sands gets daily coverage. Weird.
8581 2018-01-17 03:19:43 That was ridiculous #Shapovalov #AusOpen
8582 2018-01-17 03:19:40 If i thought for a minute that you could service your own vehicle with oil or anything else I may have doubts...but in these deficits you shine in history & politics. So in this regard, I salute you!

8592 2018-01-17 03:18:23 Imagine an immaculate Haiti, free from tropical diseases, with lush forests, beautiful homes, sprawling coffee, sugar and vanilla plantations, gold and oil exports. 

This would all be possible with a little antebellum style white supremacy.
8593 2018-01-17 03:18:14 Dude, just finding out about this now. I hope y'all get through this soon! I've never had to deal with this (knock on wood), but know others who have and they say it's bad, bad, bad. Hope you get the good drugs soon, too.

8613 2018-01-17 03:15:12 All this amazing @Amberjade_uk screen time on @BabestationTV  tonight and STILL there's no baby oil... THIS IS TORTURE!!
8614 2018-01-17 03:15:07 Our dependency on foreign oil is real.
8615 2018-01-17 03:15:05 All I can recall off the top of my head about that episode is "Black oil, and Gillian Anderson's daughter's name." Shows how invested I am in the mytharc... :p
8616 2018-01-17 03:14:55 Lol that baby oil ass chicken. I’ll pass.
8617 2018-01-17 03:14:52 The rapid expansion of debt and money was a byproduct of the oil boom.  As net energy expands rapidly, gold becomes a drag as the monetary base can't keep up.

New energy requires new money.

Because money IS energy.  Every dollar has a BTU content.
8618 2018-01-17 03:14:50 These horrors love oil and gas to much to allow their brains to comprehend the impact of scientific reasoning around climate change and the effects of it on our planet and it’s peoples.

But they are really good though. So simple yet satisfying.
8622 2018-01-17 03:13:55 Feel better! I been dodging bronchitis so far this yr. It hangs on for a cple mos & is so exhausting.  If you can, get some Peppermint oil, Eucalyptus oil & Spearmint oil online, add to pot of hot boiling h2o, tent your head w towel over pot, breath steam. Also good to sip on.

8660 2018-01-17 03:07:30 Eh... You know how 2 is the first prime number and not 1 because to be  prime the number has to be only divisible by itself and 1? Oil is like  1.  

But you could still smother it in queso if you really want...

8831 2018-01-17 02:38:48 It fits a narrative. The longer term moves in the dollar and inflation aren't always correlation, neither are crude oil or 10Y and inflation.

Inflation rose in 1999 during massive dollar bull.

Not saying can't happen

8889 2018-01-17 02:29:26 almond oil is awesome! just don’t use too much; you run the risk of clogging pores & if you use it too often your skin will stop producing its own oil bc it senses it has plenty! as a beauty pro, i recommend alternating oil and lotion in diff days and only moisturize before bed!
8890 2018-01-17 02:29:06 Amen! The Primary Christian Faith claims the right to use cannabis buds in the making of the Holy anointing oil of Christ. Let's use this miracle to heal mankind.
8891 2018-01-17 02:28:49 On my third oil unit. I’d say the high from these is pretty mellow. It feels incomplete, whereas buds tend to have a more complex mindfeel. I’m guessing you get higher variation in non-THC/CBD  cannibinoids through by blazing than using a pen with oil.

8904 2018-01-17 02:27:14 thanks I think the discourse needs to improve too, Texas is creating a lot of jobs and cheap housing do to lax regulation and that combined with oil and the nice climate makes lots of people move there including high skill workers it also has no state income tax

8937 2018-01-17 02:23:26 Actually, no.   Venezuela has huge oil revenue, 30 million people and is a basket case.

Norway has high taxes, redistributive welfare policies and invests oil $ in a state investment fund.  Republicans would call that socialism if Trump didn't just turn on the love light.
8938 2018-01-17 02:23:21 I wonder if this has more to do with potential benefit agreements continueing with the oil and gas industry and not so much with hunting and fishing? It seems a little odd that these two bands have benifit agreements with oil and gas, but oppose this.

8967 2018-01-17 02:19:48 Do you have one that fixes itself and its failed oil system so it will not blow itself up with 79k miles then BMW not care at all?  Never will I own one again.
8968 2018-01-17 02:19:21 No OIL, No LIFE!!!
8969 2018-01-17 02:19:16 CSRC Vice Chairman: Shanghai RMB Crude Oil futures impossible to launch on Jan.18 at this stage. Lots of preparation works are yet to accomplish... including settlement of USD/RMB from foreign participants. 
So, when will it launch?
8970 2018-01-17 02:19:15 Yeah, the book American Dynasty did a great job of listing most of the Bush Walker involvement as well as pointing out the oil companies as the CIA launch point internationally

8972 2018-01-17 02:19:00 Does Castor Oil help hair grow tho ? Cus my lining could use an oil change 
8973 2018-01-17 02:18:57 Thankful for my handsome man helping me put oil in my car, especially in this cold ass weather !
8974 2018-01-17 02:18:44 Also try putting on the Dry shampoo before you actually need it, like the night before!! Helps absorb the oil.
8975 2018-01-17 02:18:41 I’m sorry. Maddow ripped apart President Obama over the speech he gave after the BP oil spill off the coast of FL. She pretended to be POTUS & gave the speech she thought he should have given. #Hubris
8976 2018-01-17 02:18:28 Steve Simmons and Facts are like Oil and Water. LOL. Fuck him.
8977 2018-01-17 02:18:16 When I accidentally said "VIRGIN OIL" instead of "Virgin coconut oil" in class... fine..
8978 2018-01-17 02:18:13 I had to get an oil change last week
8979 2018-01-17 02:17:53 why is every one pretending all these news anchors are with Mr. elect president trump I know u call it shit hole now because your people made it that way long ago sucked those countries dry depleted all the gold oil minerals everything then dropped off vaccines that still kill
8980 2018-01-17 02:17:41 Maybe thats why i shouldn't have asked, I wanted it to be something wilder, like a spray bottle of baby oil or like an obnoxiously large magnifying glass, some percy shit lol...
8981 2018-01-17 02:17:08 Importantly, why not cold oil?
8982 2018-01-17 02:16:56 I want to know who Zinke is selling our oil leases to. It concerns me that the Uranium mining rights are also being sold too cheaply and to the New American Oligarchs. #Resist #BearsEars #ProtectOurCoast
8983 2018-01-17 02:16:55 No. The closest Marvel has come to affirming Deadpool's bi/pansexuality is a two panel joke where Cable telepathically inserts himself into Deadpool's mind while he's dreaming, and the dream he's having is of rubbing suntan oil on Cable's back while they are both apparently naked
8984 2018-01-17 02:16:53 I’ll bring my thieves oil tomorrow!

8989 2018-01-17 02:16:21 If you can’t call your doctors after hours lines or don’t have insurance try a cup of hot coffee sit in the shower hot one for 30 mins take 1 of any allergy pill you have and put peppermint oil on your temples
8990 2018-01-17 02:16:19 My car has a flat, needs an oil change and my left tail light is out. Plus it hasn’t seen a car wash in a hot ass minute... sigh  am I still gon out to eat tmmrw? Yes
8991 2018-01-17 02:16:19 Could have warner me so I could have gotten one more oil change
8992 2018-01-17 02:16:13 What oil/cream you using to massage?
8993 2018-01-17 02:16:11 Girl same but coconut oil has helped me a lot!!
8994 2018-01-17 02:16:09 That’s a good one, plus Cornholio should be his new name
8995 2018-01-17 02:15:59 *googles natural chapped lip remedies

Okay, I was wrong.  Coconut oil it is.
8996 2018-01-17 02:15:49 Oil
8997 2018-01-17 02:15:43 Same. I tried sublingual oil and it wasn’t super helpful. I’m moving to a legal state soon so I’m hoping to try high CBD flower and see if that works better.
8998 2018-01-17 02:15:39 He hates those oil cans. Great flick!
8999 2018-01-17 02:15:24 Damn right olive oil is "blasphemous".
9000 2018-01-17 02:15:19 u know ur black when your tv remotes, phone, & doorknobs are constantly covered in coconut oil
9001 2018-01-17 02:15:14 By the way, it's a good thing that the world is no longer under the thumb of OPEC and their desires and needs regarding world oil prices.   That they are losing their ability to artificially influence the oil market is a good thing in the long run.
9002 2018-01-17 02:15:12 “ I wake up every morning to a head scarf and the smell of coconut oil, I have myself a black queen”
9003 2018-01-17 02:14:41 Would like to see the chart hold for sure or a catalyst would be nice, oil is a sector that could maybe get heated up some, so still watching the chart, riding some free here to see what happens.
9004 2018-01-17 02:14:25 If it's Olive oil I would.
9005 2018-01-17 02:14:21 Make sure you get the roots from like 6-8 inches away and let it sit for a couple minutes so it can absorb the oil! Then brush through, (I never recommend Pantene) but they have a good dry shampoo too
9006 2018-01-17 02:14:17 Needs an oil diffuser and electric wine opener...
9007 2018-01-17 02:13:34 Would you like me to send peppermint oil so you can have a good night sleep?

9010 2018-01-17 02:13:10 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for probiotic vodka, and put some hibiscus essential oil in my diffuser.
9011 2018-01-17 02:13:02 To that point I'll reference the mayor's state of the city address a few years ago (again) where he said he wanted to cut the city's dependence on oil. But tonight the council will vote to approve an EIR for more oil.

9014 2018-01-17 02:12:18 Enchinacea, golden seal, tumeric, honey. I don't think I caught it incoming fast enough. I'll try oil of oregano. I'm also using pineapple for the cough, which helps.
9015 2018-01-17 02:11:53 Toss meat or pretty much anything you would normally fry. It fries it without oil. My wings come out pretty good.
9016 2018-01-17 02:11:48 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.
9017 2018-01-17 02:11:43 When you have control over your money, you feel as if you have control over more things in your life. Money isn’t everything, but it’s the oil for the machine.

9020 2018-01-17 02:11:14 Try to avoid washing your hair everyday. Constant shampooing leaves hair and skin dry and will increase oil production to overcompensate.

9023 2018-01-17 02:10:45 No problem, age has given me experience lol. Like I said, it doesn't stop it, but it helps. Try a loose translucent to start and then the compact I carry is the primed and pore less by too Faced because it doesn't cake up or leave anything extra in my nose. And keeps oil at bay.

9028 2018-01-17 02:10:14 You mean oil fell 1%? And +.25% AH.... Yes
9029 2018-01-17 02:10:08 You see no contradiction in talking about lower greenhouse emissions while admitting your revenue comes from oil. Think about that.
9030 2018-01-17 02:10:08 We shot ourselves in the foot imposing a tariff on Argentine soybean oil. zit's practically an agricultural byproduct there.
9031 2018-01-17 02:10:04 Sure. But when compared to the potential oil yields of algae, soybeans are to expensive as a feedstock for biofuels.
9032 2018-01-17 02:10:01 Infuriating! While Zinke flies around in a taxpayer-funded needed-for-fighting-wildfires helicopter to meet with oil/gas cronies with payola to buy our wildands away.
9033 2018-01-17 02:10:00 It is sad times that we live in!  Keep the oil in your lamps!

9060 2018-01-17 02:05:52 So the reason why we're about to see a few hours of public comment is because the people are upset that the city is trading a wetlands facelift for more oil drilling.

9115 2018-01-17 01:56:49 If you carefully obey my commands I am giving you today, to love the LORD your God and worship him with all your heart and all your soul,
I will provide in the proper time, and you will harvest your grain, new wine, and fresh oil.
You will eat and be satisfied.

9117 2018-01-17 01:56:49 Same exact risk for drilling water wells. Pipeline looters & tanker hijackings equate oil spills? Your desperation grows while you still have yet to to prove CC model results that not even NOAA, IPCC, Sierra Club, NASA, Etc. can't. Shameful..
9118 2018-01-17 01:56:27 Texas leads in solar power in the country. Let’s build on that instead of allowing big oil/natural gas to be shot callers.
9119 2018-01-17 01:56:16 え？じゃあ戦闘システム...
9120 2018-01-17 01:56:10 No National Park System Advisory Board anymore? 

They want it that way so the Trump boys can shoot the endangered animals in peace and the Trump friends can drill for oil in the parks.
9121 2018-01-17 01:55:30 He: "If you fine folks need any extra oil, I know a sweet little money-laundering LLC you can wash some bucks through so I can sell you some primo black gold."
She: "Hmm. I think I'd rather buy some bad confiscated medicinal pot from Beau Sessions."
He: "Gosh. Look at the time!"
9122 2018-01-17 01:55:03 They also get cheap oil from Iran as sanctions make trade difficult for Iran
9123 2018-01-17 01:55:03 went to walmart for some things and i had .02 of a tank, a low tire, need an oil change, and my windows' motors are frozen and will not work.
i really need you to come through with that cancellation email Laura

9127 2018-01-17 01:54:48 You don’t know pain until you get tea tree oil in your eye
9128 2018-01-17 01:54:47 Hey, #socalledPOTUS #Trump, do #Canada a #yuge favor & build one on your northern border too! #CANADAwillNOTpay4TheWall!!! Don't forget about #Alaskan borders! You'll have to stop using pipeline & arrange for tankers to ship oil back to the mainland. Use only international waters

9131 2018-01-17 01:54:26 Recommendations for face oil/moisturizer for sensitive oily/dry skin? Currently use maracuja oil but it's so expensive 
9132 2018-01-17 01:54:14 My self care amazon package containing a happy light, oil defuser, and proactive facewash just showed up. BLESSED.
9133 2018-01-17 01:54:02 But I'm a good eater.. I can eat all foods if it have sesame oil ㅋㅋㅋ
9134 2018-01-17 01:53:55 No overtime for me this week! Gonna watch that oil painted Van Gough film instead!
9135 2018-01-17 01:53:52 Hooray! My engine wasn't a $6k repair like I feared. But, because I made the mistake of trusting @jiffylube to change my oil, my engine *was* pretty damaged. ugh.
9136 2018-01-17 01:53:46 A Sec of State that worked his entire career for an oil company. He just appointed a 24 yr old campaign aide with absolutely no experience to handle the opioid crisis!

9138 2018-01-17 01:53:38 Also, animals die everyday because of companies that harvest oil for people to be able to drive cars around, also take into consideration that whatever city you're from had to destroy habitats. Everyone is involved in some sort of way.
9139 2018-01-17 01:53:04 y’all I‘m sitting in the driveway checking out CBD oil on my phone & immediately a commercial comes on for the exact store I was looking at
9140 2018-01-17 01:52:47 You mean, jobs such as Oil Spill Cleanup Worker?
9141 2018-01-17 01:52:46 You’ll regret it when the Scions have to oil and handle Hunberct Longhaft’s lever to stop the Qiqirn from summoning their primal
9142 2018-01-17 01:52:45 People will stop visiting due to cost, @gop will say no one’s interested anymore, then sell off the land to private parties and big oil. It’s an intentional move to further fatten the pockets of the very rich.

9144 2018-01-17 01:52:39 I use eucalyptus lotion and candles, and a peppermint & lavender essential oil roller on my temples, forehead, and back of the neck. This helps with my worst migraines!
9145 2018-01-17 01:52:37 Really? What good things has he done for Native Americans, the Red Man? And ordering a pipeline, made with Russian steel, that leaked oil into their water isn't helpful. Name something?
9146 2018-01-17 01:52:25 I think that should've been "I happen to agree". I do think deforestation is a huge problem and I want all nations to protect their forests. I also think the amt of C they can sequester is tiny compared to what 200+ yrs of burning coal and oil has let loose (400M yrs worth).
9147 2018-01-17 01:51:52 Olive oil and roasted garlic (a lot) base, spinach, mozzarella, salt and pepper.  Next time I’ll add an egg.
9148 2018-01-17 01:51:44 I have been on great insurance, so-so, absolute crap short term and when our business tanked when the oil and gas industry pulled back, medicaid for a short period of time. And for almost 2 years not so long ago, none. And when I got blood poisoning from a cat bite, 1/2

9151 2018-01-17 01:51:33 The Don is sucking up to Norway for one reason, Putin needs to drill for oil in the Arctic the shelf they want to drill goes into Norway’s territory, thus they need sanctions lifted and joint commitments.
9152 2018-01-17 01:51:29 living alone is great but i still haven’t managed to open that jar of coconut oil and it’s been FIVE days. I also just laughed at myself when this realisation came about for five solid minutes

9157 2018-01-17 01:50:57 hill up to their house to remind me of what they did there.  They also said they were going to make "bagels out of us" and fried us in hot oil until we had huge boils like bagel bubbles, and that was with Meghan Markels, Mary and Katie
9158 2018-01-17 01:50:52 He’s great. My wife and I met him at an Oil Kings game when his son was here with Swift Current. Awesome guy
9159 2018-01-17 01:50:40 Aren’t they supposed to send up oil drillers to blow it up or something? Or at least warn us about it?? #meteor

9172 2018-01-17 01:49:03 Right about now the US shale producers are turning their valves to fully open. In a world with Trump and his big button talk, the mid-east on bust, Russia sending bombers over Europe oil is not hitting the roof. OPEC is no longer in charge, NG keeps the lid on high oil long term.
9173 2018-01-17 01:49:02 After the blue fire in OOT and the water in MM, maybe we'll find out that we can clip through doors with lantern oil in TP Kappa
9174 2018-01-17 01:48:32 Don't send them back here, I heard California wants them. They can all ride their bikes back. Without tires of course, as tires require oil for production.
9175 2018-01-17 01:48:16 Abramovich so broke now people forget his money is oil money as well 
9176 2018-01-17 01:47:38 #Cuomo is a grandstanding moron. They’re not going to drill off the “coast” of New York. They tried in the ‘70’s and 80’s. There’s no oil...
9177 2018-01-17 01:47:16 I've passed some small ones and it is bad. I hope I never get a big one like it sounds like you are dealing with. Godspeed.

9199 2018-01-17 01:45:02 Unfortunately it will have no effect.

National Parks are something Zinke really has no interest in except as a source of Oil and Minerals.

It actually may make implementation of his agenda easier.
9200 2018-01-17 01:45:00 I made Vincent a grilled gouda cheese sandwich with coconut oil & he loved it 
9201 2018-01-17 01:44:58 Are all the men in DC back slapping good ole boys? Trump is a snake oil salesman and it amazes me how many smart people fall for his BS

I think he schmoozed the good doctor
9202 2018-01-17 01:44:56 If i die cover me in Coconut oil and burn me.
Its what the Ancestors would have wanted.
9203 2018-01-17 01:44:51 Anytime lol! If you’re looking for an oil for your face, I highly recommend almond oil (now brand is the one I use). It’s changed my oily combination skin for life.

9212 2018-01-17 01:43:15 Trump probably weighs more, but you should know muscle is more sense than fat.  That's why oil floats on water.

9214 2018-01-17 01:42:59 Sir, what are the alternate solutions for fossil energy especially oil prices are going up. We have to do much R&D for other source of energy that can be make india number 1.
9215 2018-01-17 01:42:58 First question is whether Canada is willing to play a role in countering smuggling oil by ship to NK...and has US asked Canada to play a role? #cdnpoli
9216 2018-01-17 01:42:53 He doesn't even realize that our national parks attract thousands of visitors every year. They generate revenue. Not coming to see oil wells

9225 2018-01-17 01:41:18 They Finished Most of tye Subsidies, They Imposed Maximum Taxes, They Got the Huge Benifits of Crude Oil slump....Still They Destroyed GDP
9226 2018-01-17 01:41:14 That’s what I’m doing. I think what happened is I didn’t leave enough oil for the base coat. It didn’t adhere to the pot. The center spot was dark brown after the first pass, it stuck.
9227 2018-01-17 01:41:08 Well, they could cancel the carbon tax, repeal their tax increases, repeal some of their recent labour legislation, and actually have policy which encourages development in oil/gas & pipelines. Every move this government makes stymies growth & development.
9228 2018-01-17 01:41:07 i'm not buying ponds, but i'll get grapeseed oil so I can cook with it too.
9229 2018-01-17 01:41:00 US has far more oil than Norway. We have chosen to privatize the profits. Reserves per capita are much higher in Norway though so agree impact of a SWF would be smaller in the US.
9230 2018-01-17 01:40:47 Can we do a crowd fund to put an oil rig next to MaraLago?
9231 2018-01-17 01:40:27 Tea tree oil has helped me a lot

9237 2018-01-17 01:40:06 Hope they turned out. You've inspired me to make them later this week. I like to use drippings from a roast, although I've used lard and canola oil before. 

I'm betting yours turned out well.

9241 2018-01-17 01:39:25 Fried in peanut oil, literally best tasting chicken ever.
9242 2018-01-17 01:39:12 Wonder if that has to do with 1) sovereign fund that gives every citizen a cut of the oil revenues 2) oil/gas + commerical seafood industry providing high salaries. Of course cost of living is also pretty high

9256 2018-01-17 01:37:41 You are aware that the US is experiencing an oil boom, right now, right? Why are we in the position we're in? Yes, businesses including my own, are happy to take on more sales than we've had since 2015.
9257 2018-01-17 01:37:35 Been taking fish oil pills for a week, but tonight, I tasted so much fish oil that I nearly barfed...yuck...
9258 2018-01-17 01:37:35 I’m thinking Epsom salts and lavender oil.  Trying to pick which tea I want to make.  I have too many teas.
9259 2018-01-17 01:37:18 Oil mixed with cheese, tomato sauce, pepperoni, and a crusty bread sounds lovely. So, yes, now I want pizza.
9260 2018-01-17 01:37:07 Old trick. It was also played years ago during the Iranian Oil Embargo using Aruba and its large tank farm and excellent loading facilities. No StS transfer in those days, it was ship-to-shore-to-ship.
9261 2018-01-17 01:37:07 You're welcome. I love that  too. I thought it was cute. I'm happy that you have some heat. We have a mini space heater. I followed up so we should have emergency heating oil hopefully soon. Praying things work out for you sooner too.

9273 2018-01-17 01:35:13 Also commercial fishing is almost restricted to the point to where you can't fish any of these fish anyway.  Who needs oil when you have a magic carpet to get around on.

9285 2018-01-17 01:33:23 Both. A nephew of mine is in Norway working on the oil platforms. When Obama was elected most of Europe didn’t think that it was near the big deal that we did about electing first black president. They always saw America as melting pot. Now they think that we are idiots & racists
9286 2018-01-17 01:33:21 Was this insane idea to drill off our coast done to prop up @GOP candidates, like rick Scott running for Office in coastal states? While every other country is expanding renewable energy, we get rid of safety regs, & defund emergency clean up fund for oil spill catastrophes??
9287 2018-01-17 01:33:18 But stocks in baby oil lol

9294 2018-01-17 01:31:43 Actually, that is a very fair point - and I agree if a business is almost carbon neutral (farming I imagine is close) then there shouldn't be a tax. But I am all for taxing the hell out of the oil companies and people who drive 2 blocks.

9304 2018-01-17 01:29:36 Well they hate 'not for profit' trees.
The issues for wildlife losing their homes to palm oil plantations is heartbreaking as well.
It's like a race to end Earths' time as a livable planet.
Just business as usual.

9307 2018-01-17 01:29:29 Longer working in their fields and no longer making the money they made. Oil field had massive lay offs. Everything has to do with business climate and nothing to do with race, or where you are from.

9316 2018-01-17 01:28:21 I just swallowed 10 spoons of warm oil for dinner... 
9317 2018-01-17 01:28:19 Man why do oil changes have to be so much…
9318 2018-01-17 01:28:08 So my old art teacher from undergrad has asked me to model for multiple paintings and drawings in exchange a few lessons on oil painting and I agreed.

9330 2018-01-17 01:26:17 These people don't understand that the set up of a government via constitution is what set up a system for success. Took a little more than that too. Labor laws.  I know people that used to work and we're very prosperous in oil field jobs that are American born and breed. No
9331 2018-01-17 01:26:16 OK brillliant.  what is his next chess move. Putin as vp, dump pence.  Open more uranium mines, oh already done when no one want uranium. More oil, ever see the rest of the world, wind mills. We r behind the curve thanks to our toddler president.

9345 2018-01-17 01:24:38 I truthfully have only tried it once but I was not impressed. Was it the location? Idk bc only one time but it had no flavor, no spices, just oil and breaded chicken. I should give it another try one day and see.

9355 2018-01-17 01:23:06 Oh sorry to hear! Maybe try a little less under the arms and allow to dry first before putting your shirt on. It can stain though as it’s oil based. Did you find that it worked though?

9413 2018-01-17 01:15:41 Yesterday I was more stressed than I've been in a long time, so I only got three hours of sleep. I accidentally fell asleep and now my dad is yelling at me because I didn't schedule an oil change.

9422 2018-01-17 01:14:33 A guy goes in for an oil change and leaves spending close to a $1000 on repairs. The guy is me and the joke is ON me 
9423 2018-01-17 01:14:32 Can we talk about how bay was expected to get her oil changed 246 miles ago but she’s still going strong and hasn’t beeped that she needs her oil changed yet like  you go girl

9445 2018-01-17 01:11:55 I'm glad it works for you.  Everything has the possibility of side-effects, even natural things.  Gabapentin and lyrica have changed MANY lives for the better, but like I said anything can have bad side-effects. I hope cbd oil continues to work for you.
9446 2018-01-17 01:11:55 Already did the tide pod challenge& now I accept cbd oil to the balls challenge

9448 2018-01-17 01:11:35 who's job is it to oil up Jinder tonight #SDLive
9449 2018-01-17 01:11:34 No.I’m sharing news of immense savings from EVs so more Canadians have more monthly income to buy a house instead handing money to big oil.
9450 2018-01-17 01:11:26 しょうがないにゃぁ。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。。
9451 2018-01-17 01:11:24 most likely to accidentally pour vodka into their essential oil diffuser instead of water
9452 2018-01-17 01:11:21 Coal can cause black lung. How often do oil spills happen? I know what fracking can cause. Earthquakes can cause the same so can erosion, so can old landfills.
9453 2018-01-17 01:11:15 Did jinder swim in the baby oil GESH #SDLive
9454 2018-01-17 01:11:11 I think very little debt is putting it mildly. World's largest Sovereign wealth fund of almost $ 1 trillion (they aren't making more North Sea Oil & not quite all petrostates are run by fools).

9463 2018-01-17 01:10:37 Today's essential oil blend is peppermint, lemongrass and rosemary.  It smells like focus and success! ;)
9464 2018-01-17 01:10:37 I thought Jinder had a lot of baby oil on, and Twitter just confirmed it for me. #SDLive
9465 2018-01-17 01:10:28 夏とかTシャツに油のシミできるよねえ。あれ透けるからほぼ全裸みたいになるよ僕。
9466 2018-01-17 01:10:27 Maybe it does, but that oil will have texture, spices and its cheesy, yum.
9467 2018-01-17 01:10:21 He checks your oil?
9468 2018-01-17 01:10:11 A booming oil industry = destruction of our planet and health. But Calvert has a long history of denying climate change, as he puts profit before people. @TeamCalvert
9469 2018-01-17 01:10:09 They have baby oil in India?

9485 2018-01-17 01:08:11 Bless his heart. He looks like the cap of the baby oil bottle fell off as he was piling himself.

9516 2018-01-17 01:04:59 I went in to get my oil changed (3000 miles past due oops ) and the guy was asking me all these questions about my car and I probably looked like a 6 year old who just got asked to do trigonometry.

9576 2018-01-17 00:57:54 The shit I am getting because we’re not willing to spend our oil money is unbelievable mate.
9577 2018-01-17 00:57:50 Are they referring to the soybean oil?
9578 2018-01-17 00:57:01 Plus we only get $37 for a barrel of oil because our politics here are broken and have handcuffed us to be at the mercy of the states.
9579 2018-01-17 00:56:56 じょん
9580 2018-01-17 00:56:48 Well that seems dumb.  So now he can populate it with oil & gas and mining dudes?
9581 2018-01-17 00:56:44 Can do sewage, waste oil and refuse
9582 2018-01-17 00:56:16 This oil change is taking tooo damn long.
9583 2018-01-17 00:56:08 I bet the oil companies had no trouble getting a meeting.

9585 2018-01-17 00:55:55 I need to oil my scalp
9586 2018-01-17 00:55:37 Okay I took a like, 45 min bath with herbs and coconut oil and lilac/sage oil (a surprisingly pleasing scent combo) and my favorite rocks and now I'm ready to try again on today's group reading 
9587 2018-01-17 00:55:34 Then I come and said "Boy, I am a Petroleum Engineer.I can drill to make your grave deep down to 500 ft and make the oil come out" 
9588 2018-01-17 00:55:21 Worm oil.

9590 2018-01-17 00:55:06 you... didn't like freaky blinders? every frame is like an oil painting.
9591 2018-01-17 00:54:56 Would you rather give the money to countries that hate us for their oil when we have more in this country than they do. Educate yourself your beginning to sound stupid now
9592 2018-01-17 00:54:44 I use coconut oil. Works well, even for excessively oily skin.
9593 2018-01-17 00:54:41 逆に考えるどころか普通に考えてる思考ですよね。
謎理論で勧誘するのやめちくり〜〜
9594 2018-01-17 00:54:33 Been following Zinke all year last year.  All he's done is cater to Big Oil and mining interests.  Every move he's made is in preparation for Big Oil and mining companies to come in on federal land leases and make $$$.  And Scott Pruitt at EPA is paving the way for him to do it.
9595 2018-01-17 00:54:24 Wow Argon Oil is so nice on beards 
9596 2018-01-17 00:53:57 Yup, foresee a weaker crude oil price soon...

China and technical.
9597 2018-01-17 00:53:49 逆に考えるんだ。2次元が出来ているのでx軸とy軸が既に頭の中にある。あと1本軸を足したところでなんてことはないと。

9598 2018-01-17 00:53:47 Smells like burning oil...man that brought back memories.  Shizu was always fiddling with her mecha spiders...wonder if she'd made more of them?

9606 2018-01-17 00:52:53 ok ok coconut oil by @lizzo is an amazing album to play while getting ready for a night out
9607 2018-01-17 00:52:45 Also, "homeopathy is bullshit" isn't a "choice" it's reality.

Waste your money on it, fine.

But don't think for a second that it's anything other than legal snake oil.
9608 2018-01-17 00:52:43 I did mention in the summer that it was time to buy oil stocks.  Crude steadily higher after OPEC agreed to extend production curbs.  Sold all of my Exxon in Jan 2018.  Huge gain plus dividends.  Bought NTDOY a week ago.  ADR for Nintendo Corp.  Solid 50 to 75% potential in 2018.

9611 2018-01-17 00:51:57 Warm extra virgin olive oil is heart-healthy and rich in antioxidants, you putz.
9612 2018-01-17 00:51:54 It’s too bad as part of #TheResistance Oregon’s leaders have no influence at all with the President on key issues like offshore oil drilling and legal marijuana. God forbid we need federal help in an earthquake or tsunami.
9613 2018-01-17 00:51:46 If there is no oil then no drilling
9614 2018-01-17 00:51:39 for some reason ioannis insists on keeping a giant bottle of valve oil in the bathroom

9623 2018-01-17 00:50:29 my response was totally just “oh so eating pizza is basically oil pulling? i think that’s supposed to be good for you”
9624 2018-01-17 00:50:21 My head hurts, how is being "Over oil" unrealistic if we will eventually run out of it?! Hello?

9627 2018-01-17 00:49:44 This is just the beginning of oil price running up, MMS did a good job when the oil prices where at 120 dollars/barrel let us see how #NaMo handles the situation
9628 2018-01-17 00:49:40 The mrt lrt episodes start today. I gave up with the traffic and the oil price 
9629 2018-01-17 00:49:35 Yup. Im in cold status. I have caught the bug. Ah well. Time tea tree oil for sinuses and dayquil for work.
9630 2018-01-17 00:49:32 Check oil?  Clean air filter?  Pfft.  With 360 tanks you don't have to bother with those mundane tasks....
9631 2018-01-17 00:49:13 Those whose mental health should be questioned are the people who bought your ineffective blood sugar lowering snake oil supplements.
9632 2018-01-17 00:49:06 僕を酸化させたらダメだよ。オイルにとって酸化は命取り。…僕を見守っててね⁇
9633 2018-01-17 00:49:00 And always remember: oils are sealants, not moisturizers. If you put oil on a dry scalp, it will seal in the dryness
9634 2018-01-17 00:48:49 Remember kids, don't mess up with oil
9635 2018-01-17 00:48:32 昨日死ぬ気でやったわ

9638 2018-01-17 00:48:13 1.  Public bank. @GovMurphy is taking the initiative on this. 
2.  Taxing any oil spillage in NY waters at $100 a barrel. (TaxScam scrapped federal tax of paltry 1 cent per barrel.)

9640 2018-01-17 00:47:55 Try applying coconut oil (or any dandruff preventing oil) to your hair and scalp for 30 minutes before shampooing. I used to get itchy, dry scalp all the time, then I started doing this and it works well for me
9641 2018-01-17 00:47:54 Yes oooo. God will give you more wisdom. And I belief if this year budget is implemented well with d rise of crude oil in d market Nigeria will laugh in year 2018.
9642 2018-01-17 00:47:53 I almost used my bottle of body oil instead of lens solution the other day when I went to put my contacts in. That could’ve been disastrous 
9643 2018-01-17 00:47:53 Here’s a story for ya funny bone. my bro locked me in the bathroom when we were kids to get him back I put the dogs crap from the garden into a small bucket of oil from my dads garage. And while he sun bathing in the garden under my bedroom window I tipped it on him. He was angry
9644 2018-01-17 00:47:34 @KraftBrand hey, I’m having a tough time find Oil and Vinegar dressing lately. Are you cutting the line? It’s my favourite and really hope it stays!

9647 2018-01-17 00:47:17 At the risk of sounding like RollSafe: "if you don't have an oil pipeline running there you can't have an oil leak there"
9648 2018-01-17 00:47:09 @Tesla With so many cities and towns throughout the US helplessly dependent on dirty energy (coal, oil and gas) as well as failed industry, have you considered setting up shop in such places that would benefit from your company's presence and change the unsustainable status quo?
9649 2018-01-17 00:47:01 What about if you eat the pizza cold for breakfast? It’s nothing like warm oil then!
9650 2018-01-17 00:46:41 If this "off shore oil drilling" invitation by Trump doesn't get shot down, I will be more angry than I was before, and that's pretty angry.
9651 2018-01-17 00:46:31 As a socialist Brexiteer, I used to play Left Brexit Bingo. If I saw anyone that wasn't UKIP or Tory, I'd give myself a boiled sweet. Don't blame the exit door for creaking. Blame who forgot to oil it!
9652 2018-01-17 00:46:27 Almost drank my sesame oil because I'm the least attentive person on the planet. It doesn't even look like the seltzer I was drinking.
9653 2018-01-17 00:46:14 There's no oil drilling in Flint.

9658 2018-01-17 00:45:39 @Walmart I will never go to the Automotive dept for service in Ashland, WI ever again! The absolute worst service EVER! Took 2 hours for an oil change and another 2 hours for a battery replacement because they claim it wasn't on the original work order.
9659 2018-01-17 00:45:21 Indeed my friend; he’s a bot. If he were a real person, I would have told him: No we didn’t elect him, Russia did. BUT, most of all #TheResistance didn’t vote for a traitor, a charlatan, a snake oil salesman, a 5x draft dodger, a grabber & a Russian mole in the White House.

9662 2018-01-17 00:45:05 Me at the oil change place when they give me a list of things I should fix: “I’ll have to ask my dad”
9663 2018-01-17 00:44:56 How big are the spoonfuls? What kind of oil is it? I dunno that pizza looks like it might be from the freezer. Good drizzle of basil infused olive oil might give it actual flavor.
9664 2018-01-17 00:44:51 You should include the price of oil on that chart as well as the left has repeatedly used its recent dip in price as THE reason for the failing nation... not socialism
9665 2018-01-17 00:44:21 Sorry at this point you are responding to things that happened almost 20 minutes ago. I'm already to the oil argument 

This is clearly not productive, you have a great night with your kool-aid. #DrinkUp

9669 2018-01-17 00:43:48 The Scandinavians tired of warfare centuries ago. With the discovery of oil relatively late in the game, NOR applied lessons learned fm elsewhere and reinvested in their Country - it's people.
9670 2018-01-17 00:43:46 Rare trashfood indulgence tonight. Ramen hot seared in a cast iron wok with sesame oil and red chiles.

It's not great for you. It's not expensive. It's super tasty, though.
9671 2018-01-17 00:43:43 Does anyone know where I can get a decently price alternator. 

Sometimes I wish I never had a car to start cause no matter who you get one from it will always have some issues. I should be able to go 3 years with a car only having to worry about gas and a oil change 1/2

9715 2018-01-17 00:39:09 If the US OIL industry is running out of workers, you might want to look for it in Alberta. Trudeau is not helping them to prosper. Many highly qualified people there

9721 2018-01-17 00:38:36 Considering that the only thing that he would have hit was last summer and he changed your oil a couple months later, I’m pretty sure whatever “slow leak” you have would’ve been seen. Your problem must be self inflicted

9734 2018-01-17 00:36:42 It's like the GOP goes to I companies and asks them if they could please rape our lands while giving as little to the state as possible. They do the same crap in Oklahoma with oil and natural gas.
9735 2018-01-17 00:36:32 Tea tree oil?

9738 2018-01-17 00:36:02 Man usually I’d be feeling pretty good about the 600 check from shoveling a roof but I got to fill my oil tank when I move in so there goes that 600 bucks
9739 2018-01-17 00:36:02 Heads up the Marathon Oil Refinery is doing  routine burnoff there is no need for concern at this time, the large flame is normal

9825 2018-01-17 00:24:30 and then both oil exporters and China were shedding reserves in 14/15

9889 2018-01-17 00:16:17 In cold weather it is of the utmost importance to keep your crux properly lubricated.
Make sure to grease your crux regularly at all designated chassis points and don't forget to change your crux's oil every 3 months or 3,000 cruxflops, whichever comes first.

9892 2018-01-17 00:15:48 Agreed; unfortunately as @NicoleInPain has stated, it does NOT work, even for those who HAVE tried it.
In addition, it is NOT available to all CPPs in ALL states.
Those two facts combine to make CBD Oil a non-viable option for adjunct therapeutic relief for many CPPs.

9901 2018-01-17 00:14:44 We didn’t, we had a much smaller effect of the 2007 financial crisis than the US, because of our federal pension fund and sensible politics. The only “crisis” we had with lower oil price was a small temporary increase in unemployment.

9903 2018-01-17 00:14:06 Correct. And any blockchain that claims decentralization and trustlessness as well as scalability is selling snake oil at the moment.

9938 2018-01-17 00:09:14 You can get it anywhere . Coconut oil is at Walmart . I got the beeswax from sprouts. & Unfortunately I wouldn't be able to tell you where to get the shea because I got it at a convention . But possibly beauty supply stores could carry
9939 2018-01-17 00:09:13 yes although I'd reccomend coconut oil more
9940 2018-01-17 00:09:09 You won’t believe but John D. Rockefeller himself thought the US was running out of oil at the beginning of the 20th century.
9941 2018-01-17 00:09:08 How about olive oil & garlic instead?
9942 2018-01-17 00:09:08 Sometimes I put a few drops of an essential oil, usually sage or lavender OR patchouli, on a cotton pad and either just smell it or rub it on my bod somewhere! Scents can really bring a soothing, calm but distracting energy

9946 2018-01-17 00:08:38 I ask because I was under the impression that peppermint oil is usually applied topically when it’s used for pain relief, which...might explain that
9947 2018-01-17 00:08:35 That's alarming. We need protection for pur national and national parks. Trump wants to drill for oil in them
