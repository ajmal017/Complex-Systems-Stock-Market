3 2018-07-22 23:59:16 To say they never were is false. To say they were able to hide it better. USA has been dependent on their oil so we play nice. Now we are becoming the world oil producer. Enabling us to pressure places like China to look else where. Remember how Isis was funded by selling oil?

35 2018-07-22 23:56:00 The olive oil industry was better when the oil literally poisoned us but no those sjws had to make it non poisonus

39 2018-07-22 23:55:03 Drinking oil doesn't seem natural to me. Non starchy veg and protein is a good way to satisfy and reach goals. I typically have one high fat meal a day and one high carb low fat. The other meal is leanish protein and lowgi)

46 2018-07-22 23:54:10 Super easy recipe! 

Using the spiralizer... 

Green onion + radishes + spring turnips + fresh garlic zucchini + s&p

So summery, full of crunch & simple flavours. 

Will eat this over orzo with a pesto made with garlic scapes & a drizzle of olive oil.

49 2018-07-22 23:53:37 Awwwwwww....nothing like the smell of rain water and coconut oil in my locs to end my day  #LOVE #CollectingRainWater
50 2018-07-22 23:53:03 Shout out to everyone burning the midnight oil, I see you . This will pay off one day, God bless your grind. Now let's continue to work

52 2018-07-22 23:52:41 Let's sell the strategic oil reserve to Ivanka. Either that, or put it on eBay
53 2018-07-22 23:52:24 Oil Baron visiting the refinery: what do you mean I can't use this to make French fries
54 2018-07-22 23:52:18 Doh! Of course. I have sesame oil.
55 2018-07-22 23:51:47 When I have my eucalyptus oil in my diffuser I’m in relaxation heaven 
56 2018-07-22 23:51:41 HAHA thanks miss oil, rescue missions are a tradition by this point
57 2018-07-22 23:51:29 Yeah but I meant like a convention only about art and all things art related! So all panels are art related and about artists on social media and they have separate rooms full of easels and canvases for oil/acrylic workshops and such! Then have artists alley on top of that too!
58 2018-07-22 23:51:27 I wash my face twice a day. At night I use jojoba oil to remove my makeup then cleanse w/ a cleanser, exfoliate, then I tone with rose water, then seal with an oil, add serums, eye cream, then moisturizer. Try out the ordinary’s hyaluronic acid for your dry skin.
59 2018-07-22 23:51:05 I now smell like marshmallows and beard oil.
60 2018-07-22 23:51:02 I am still waiting for the headcount. Hillary pushed Obama into a joint effort with Sarkozy to erase Moammar Gadhafi (MG) off the planet. Libya, ex colony of France, was launching it's own currancy. Completely GOLD back. This would destroy Frances central bank. (Oil trade).
61 2018-07-22 23:50:37 Wow. He’s more snakey about his snake oil hustle than I thought.
62 2018-07-22 23:50:29 There is nothing inherently wrong with avocado toast. There is nothing inherently wrong with truffle oil, there is nothing inherently wrong with McDonalds food. Get off your high horse, and let people enjoy things, like all things, in moderation.
63 2018-07-22 23:50:25 Tingim ....Floating the kina decreased our buying power...now we have to sell our resources (been gold oil gas) to get foreign  strong Kina means we can afford to goods overseas cheaper, so no need to sell our resources.  #debt cycle

70 2018-07-22 23:49:53 Olive and sesame oil then
71 2018-07-22 23:49:41 If oil prices falls by another 2-3 per barrel expect OMC and Airline stocks to move up. Watch crude oil and then one can take position in BPCL and Spice Jet.
72 2018-07-22 23:49:40 baby oil works for me!
73 2018-07-22 23:49:25 Just guarantee a British pension payment plus a top up of a Scot oil dividend of a further 20%. From license money and other region tanker revenue.  Turn 75% pensioners against to 60% in favour overnight.

78 2018-07-22 23:48:59 Dad is a  type 2 diabetic and was taking 2 long acting shots a day and I’ve been able to cut him back to one with the CBD oil. He’s got dementia coming on and pains and he’s been really doing better.
79 2018-07-22 23:48:50 I bought oil from Charlotte's Web but the prices aren't sustainable for me long term so I just bought the isolate (powder) in bulk form which is more but cost effective over time, and can be made into an oil from there .
80 2018-07-22 23:48:39 I would not be surprised if Putin had both parties set to devour themselves regardless.
Hillary wins, a disarming of the people through fear!
Trump wins, oil barons unite!
The #duopoly can be played.
Time to become resilient to financial manipulation. 
#endcorporatecontrolnow!
81 2018-07-22 23:48:32 Actions?  That makes no sense!  Trump put the most sanctions on Putin. He told Germany not to buy oil from Russia. Your losing it. It was the words that upset everyone. Do you charge Trump rent to live in your head?
82 2018-07-22 23:48:24 .@BurntLemonTC We screamed and shouted, now time for a not-very-punk steam with eucalyptus oil, can't wait to do it all again next Saturday! #halfmoonshania
83 2018-07-22 23:48:12 Continue the Brazilian theme. White rice (Google the Brazilian style using garlic and oil) and black beans. Collard greens and farofa as topping. Nothing better with picanha, trust me.
84 2018-07-22 23:48:10 JULY 21st Wear Red, find a new Majick wand, anoint it with altar oil
85 2018-07-22 23:48:05 Olive oil/butter. I guess that is what bacon grease is for. Plus sugar for the kids' tea.
86 2018-07-22 23:47:52 Bruh...it was wild but its fine now, my oil just overflowed
87 2018-07-22 23:47:31 China & South Korea are playing the US re North Korea & @realDonaldTrump went along hoping for the best, but that isn't happening. US is going to have to enforce sanctions by sinking vessels delivering NK oil products & interdicting other vessels going to & from NK @DeptofDefense
88 2018-07-22 23:47:21 I also have some snake oil you can buy, had I known you were in the market I would gotten it for you

91 2018-07-22 23:47:11 Went to my local @lushcosmetics recently looking for a new shampoo to help my out of control hair. One of the employees recommended the ‘Jason and the Argan Oil’ shampoo bar & it has given my hair LIFE. My hair is dry AF towards the ends & greasy at the top & this balanced it out
92 2018-07-22 23:47:02 if crude oil falls to below $65 per barrel then expect rupee to appreciate to 66.RBI may then hold int rates. It all depends on Iran if it decides to re work on nuclear deal and US too makes some concessions.Oil mkt will see big correction and it may fall to $60
93 2018-07-22 23:46:52 Venezuela should be cautionary tale, one of most oil rich nations nationalized oil and other industries and frittered away not just wealth but even food and water are hard to come by now
94 2018-07-22 23:46:51 Chef Louis cut up some Pikmin, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was veal, along with hot sauce.

96 2018-07-22 23:46:39 Drug Emporium seems to not be carrying CBD oil anymore. That’s how you know some products really work. 
97 2018-07-22 23:46:39 Thanks so much for the reply. Where do you get those? I have the CBD vape oil for mild attacks and it definitely helps. I’ve never seen the edibles.

99 2018-07-22 23:46:17 If you were being objective, you would know that it is impossible to stop Iran oil exports 100%, but you don't need to stop it 100%. 50% is achievable and it will hurt the Iranian people badly, the regime will go on raping the country while the ordinary people suffer even more.
100 2018-07-22 23:46:14 There’s a lot of voodoo-science in engine oil marketing that play into individual confirmation biases.

103 2018-07-22 23:45:50 Now, what did I do with that bottle of Extra Virgin Olive Oil...
104 2018-07-22 23:45:46 "I do creak from time to time... But even at this age this body doesn't quit! Still fully functional, /especially/ the hips...!"

It seems both had the mental image of the other oiled up. Though his excitement was more... visible.

"Well, if y'wanna oil me up still, be my guest!"

109 2018-07-22 23:45:15 But few admit to being communist so where do you draw the line? If someone supports redistribution of resources does that make them a communist? How about eliminating inheritance? Are state run industries (oil, timber) communist? Is China communist? Sweden?
110 2018-07-22 23:45:10 Also I put olive oil and castor oil on his skin after the baths so his skin isn't itchy. I think he has a beef/wheat allergy though.

121 2018-07-22 23:43:42 Shuts down all oil from the Middle East...expect higher gasoline prices if they carry out that threat..
122 2018-07-22 23:43:34 The U.S GDP data for the 2nd quarter will be released on 27th. Economists predict GDP expanded at a 4.2% annualised rate, compared with a 2% at the start of the year. Global markets trends & crude oil prices movement will also dictate the trend on the stock market next week
123 2018-07-22 23:43:32 It’s also to keep their dealerships from going out of business.

Imagine no oil changes. No transmission repairs/oil changes. No timing belt changes. Brake jobs once every 5 years.
124 2018-07-22 23:43:21 Coconut oil treatments will lower the risk of damage, just sleep with it in your hair, bleach your hair with it still in your hair in the morning and then wash it out with the purple shampoo and repeat as long as you need to

127 2018-07-22 23:42:59 Suppose 100 people pour 100 mL of water into 100 mL of cooking oil, and all 100 people observe that the oil sits above the water. Based only on this knowledge alone and no previous information, what will you expect to see when you do the same experiment?

152 2018-07-22 23:39:34 For year after year it gives its fruit which is the olive from which olive oil is obtained. they are living beings with a lot of vitality
153 2018-07-22 23:39:29 I adore you. You have the spirit of someone so youthful and frolicsome. You are a fireball.  I am about 6 years younger than you and my arthritis makes me look like I'm 90. I need the Tin Man's oil can.
154 2018-07-22 23:39:23 What the fuck aisle is coconut oil on at @cvs !
155 2018-07-22 23:39:22 Yes they plan to take Yemen and wanted Syria ...(due to massive Oil and Gas reserves in the Golan heights) Thank God Putin stepped in to stop the robbery ...remember many Jews are NOT happy with this ....
156 2018-07-22 23:39:11 All qualities of money are spectra, not black & white.

Bitcoin is moderately fungible – moreso than oil, also a commodity.
157 2018-07-22 23:39:00 ..did suck (actually everyone did suck, some more (Kroos, Khedira, Gomez, Özil) some less) but the whole team&staff itself is the problem and that shows right now how they still put oil in the fire. I'm disgustes by the DFB even more than before.
158 2018-07-22 23:38:58 oil painting? more like
oil pain 
159 2018-07-22 23:38:44 Dewayne...why you put that baby oil on before getting in the pool looking like a baby seal.
160 2018-07-22 23:38:41 I really dig that Christopher Hitchens style of burning the midnight oil talking at length to flesh out ideas. Hitch was well known for it, and I'm a glutton in the same way.

162 2018-07-22 23:37:47 Having no job, drinking and going out loads is some laugh, probably won’t be fun when all of my Arabic oil money dries up
163 2018-07-22 23:36:50 I moved out when I was 19.  Got into some debt problems.  I can assure you it was clothes and partying...not tampons.
164 2018-07-22 23:36:26 You know, you are the first person I hear has been blocked by him. You must be entirely too dangerous for him—way knowledgeable about his own field plus being able to take him on with the snake oil literary references. I’ve never gotten any reaction out of him. None at all.
165 2018-07-22 23:36:15 Loathsome Harper and those who followed will love this just as Trudeau and Freeland do. Just like Ukraine has good Nazis according to our government- Terrorists are ok as long as they support our goal of getting oil thru Syria into Europe.
166 2018-07-22 23:35:50  try tea tree oil or tiger balm if you can find it. I got over 20 bites when I was in Cancun, it was the worst so I feel you
167 2018-07-22 23:35:47 How about if we stop supporting the oil industry.
168 2018-07-22 23:35:18 Brown beef, remove. Then cook onions and peppers in fat, with a little olive oil and garlic. Add can of tomatoes and beef back. Also cook pasta. Add it all together with some Parmesan and basil

177 2018-07-22 23:34:28 One question, Sebastian: Is it possible to find out if all the oil that is imported by the US, from Canada, is used in the US? Thanks.
178 2018-07-22 23:34:28 ぽはよーー！！
179 2018-07-22 23:34:20 Fuuuuck no, my car smells like strippers and motor oil
180 2018-07-22 23:34:18 It's was democrats who sold uranium , oil ,steel ,aluminum and skolkovo to Russians . Trump closed two embassies ,limited visas , killed Russian mercenaries ,weapons to Ukraine ,troops to Poland , increased NATO spending ,sanctions of Russian individuals .
181 2018-07-22 23:34:10 ねて
182 2018-07-22 23:34:09 Is really having a pot of oil that hard? Kappa
183 2018-07-22 23:34:09 Yesssssss so good I can eat them all day long but the amount of oil always kills it for me
184 2018-07-22 23:33:52 So the line is we know UK is rooted but trust us Scotland on its own with all oil and food and whisky revenues would be far worse off by trading with the show of Europe.

186 2018-07-22 23:33:42 I know that Venezuela is in deep shit but it’s because they lost their oil reserves
187 2018-07-22 23:33:34 About time I do a damn oil change
188 2018-07-22 23:33:26 Too bad I didn’t get Tyler and Mike when I went for an oil change last year.  Good story.

190 2018-07-22 23:33:08 This that without the bottle waste you just add olive oil
191 2018-07-22 23:32:54 Girl, I've tried this and everything under the damn sun. I'm thinking I just didn't try the different food long enough to see a difference, but I'll be adding the coconut oil to it as well.
192 2018-07-22 23:32:53 Absolutely.

The 4th of July meeting proves the GOP are still intending to divide billions from Russian oil

Beyond that, Russia has tendrils everywhere that they can use to promise/pay Bribes

Still, glad they caught the New Russia Alliance

200 2018-07-22 23:31:18 It's not oil. I was going to try stripper but it'll just run off the spindles.  I guess sanding is the only solution. If it works, I'm going clear.
201 2018-07-22 23:31:08 Venezuela ranks number 1 in oil reserves. Yet they are starving due to their socialism. BTW Exactly the government DEMS want for America
202 2018-07-22 23:31:00 It not only about RUS Sanctions being lifted, it is Puppet Trump giving Putin liberty of invasion of Ukraine Crimea. Next Putin & Trump will interfere trying to Stop IRAN free Democratic will of Exporting Oil! Mark my word, IRAN will Fight militarily Against Trump=WW3

210 2018-07-22 23:29:49 "do these things have oil? I don't eat oil..."

212 2018-07-22 23:29:45 Next they will mandate that Baby Oil can only be made from real babies. 
213 2018-07-22 23:29:36 I like returning the favor. OIL is very civil and I always agree to their extensions. Have not had a situation yet where I would have had to oppose, and it's only civil to agree
214 2018-07-22 23:29:34 He did not even mention $26b Oil contract scam.....ask Baru!

223 2018-07-22 23:28:03 I’m getting an oil change all by myself. WOW LOOK AT ME ADULTING
224 2018-07-22 23:27:52 てか片付けたり落ちた棚を落ちない場所に付け直して衣装ケースとか置き直したり散らばってるもの集めたりしたはずなのに部屋が片付いてる景色になってないからこれは長期戦なんだろうけど長期にすると散らかって少し戻って、、三歩歩いて二歩下がる的な現象になりそう。努力が必要也
225 2018-07-22 23:27:38 Anyone who thinks we need to outspend the next five countries combined on defense to be strong doesn't have a lot of faith in America and its soldiers, Most of that money is just a scam to pay off defense contractors and big oil for lining GOP pockets.
226 2018-07-22 23:27:33 Are there many black folks in the oil and gas sector?
227 2018-07-22 23:27:30 Much better than that oil painting you colourised
228 2018-07-22 23:27:14 Did they forget tonput air in it? The Walmart in my town has changed oil and forgot to put oil back in it.
229 2018-07-22 23:27:02 Sea Salt. Give me a break! At TV was a documentary about this. In MA a truck for liquids was filled with water from a harbor with boats (their engines use gas and oil) and went to the factory for preparation. Compare sea salt with that (millions years old) from mines all over US.
230 2018-07-22 23:26:31 N
Yes, and they talked about the price of Caviar, Israel, PLO, what a dick Chris Wallace is, fake news, hotels in Russia,  WMD,  oil prices,  and come to the WH.  Grow up America!! Donald and Vladimir can get along.  Get over it!!

233 2018-07-22 23:26:03 Maybe a tiny bit of oil exactly on the connected area can help? ;;
234 2018-07-22 23:25:35 All of those tourists covered with oil.
235 2018-07-22 23:25:31 Your body gon shine if you rub oil on it.

237 2018-07-22 23:25:22 A Large bath is always appreciated,Especially with an amount of lavender oil for good measure.

239 2018-07-22 23:25:02 ground crew in jumpsuits swarming around me while their chief yells to get some oil, that knee is clicking again
240 2018-07-22 23:24:49 Olive oil is good too.
241 2018-07-22 23:24:29 Some of you will rub oil all over your body and start shouting “glooowwww”
242 2018-07-22 23:24:19 Try using oil

245 2018-07-22 23:23:43 何してもなんか似合わないのは体型のせいだとずっと思ってて シルエットは顔より人を綺麗に見せるのでは、と思う瞬間が多かったから。垢抜けたいという気持ちと共に良いシルエットになる目標は忘れないで生きたい、とてもわかりやすいから。
246 2018-07-22 23:23:42 Baby oil
247 2018-07-22 23:23:39 Spray some wd-40 or pb-blaster on it and let it soak over night. Good as new or just a drop where it is siezed up (center pivot point). You could probably use any oil you have (veg oil would be fine).
248 2018-07-22 23:23:25 but after all is said and done tesla still aint got the car I aint got money the world could have ended the fossil or oil like ten years ago already its he test on salt flat half state from his school
249 2018-07-22 23:23:06 I don’t think it is money, I think it is land, water, oil, solar, batteries- once ‘they’ own everything, and run the world like a ‘business’, they can then reduce the Human Resources, eliminate the ‘workers’ draining the system.
250 2018-07-22 23:22:52 @cheekywipes do awesome face wipes. Eco friendly, cruelty free, different fabrics. Use them with coconut oil.

ACV + coconut oil always.
255 2018-07-22 23:21:35 How many of those Universal income experiments have been successful?  Besides the ones that are supported by oil sales.
256 2018-07-22 23:21:33 THW ban all new and existing offshore oil drilling.
257 2018-07-22 23:21:33 It's actually dangerous to use the oils in their full strength. That's why they are diluted with a filler oil like coconut.
258 2018-07-22 23:21:31 @GuyFieri Hey Guy....I've never seen oil rig chefs compete. They've got awesome cooks on those rigs. If they're not...they swim home. Just an idea for GGG!
259 2018-07-22 23:21:28 Everything Trump is doing is for Russia. Ending the Iran deal to prop up Russia with higher oil prices (bad for the US). Slow playing the sanctions to help Russia. Bowing to Putin and North Korea as they both laugh in our faces. Destroying NATO. Trade war w Canada=trade deficit.
260 2018-07-22 23:21:24 Untunglah company goyang kaki..aku kerja oil & gas dulu, dia punya data pecah otak..tak sama format macam company lain..sebab berkaitan seller overseas..account data dia menimbun macam-macam negara..kau silap kira & sent habislah dahlah ada timing kerja data ni..
261 2018-07-22 23:21:11 Make pseudo-pesto with it, just oil and basil. Then freeze it in ice cube trays. Great for improving jarred spaghetti sauce.

270 2018-07-22 23:19:30 You, very wise, stepping over corpses in front of your house, i'm not spendig 2 extra dollars for you! you should've pursued preventative holistic medicine.

Also you: shelling out thousands for wars for oil, and GE tax breaks

this is the behavior of a self absorbed narcissist.
271 2018-07-22 23:19:25 @GothamSteel we purchased one of your copper fry pans recently and have struggled to cook anything without it sticking or burning even adding oil to the pan does not help  very disappointed as not what was sold to me in the commercials

I dunno why i'm tellin you this. I just had a rough day
274 2018-07-22 23:19:02 I'm terrible at recipes - grated zucc + onion squeezed of its water, an egg or two, some salt, garlic and herbs, maybe 1/4 cup chickpea flour per cup of veg, enough to make a very scant batter, stir it up and fry in oil.

282 2018-07-22 23:17:57 Why did my mom spend $50 on oils to make a “super oil hair product” as she puts it?? I got coconut oil from freshco for $3.49 and my hair has never felt better
283 2018-07-22 23:17:15 Friend of mine tried to deep fat fry one of those and it disappeared. Just nothing there but oil and a couple bone chips

Now, if they had found oil...
288 2018-07-22 23:16:40 I finally realized that I just am not one of those girlies that can moisturize my hair once and be set for 3 or 4 days. I need to refresh with some light water and leave in/oil on a daily basis. My hair is so happy I let that type 3 mentality go WHEW

292 2018-07-22 23:16:07 We'd use our tax money for the common good. Not millions wasted on incentives for corps like big oil or huge tax cuts for wealthy political donors.

Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said that no country in the region will export oil if Iran’s exports are stopped. The same threat was earlier voiced by President Hassan Rouhani.

381 2018-07-22 22:59:54 Why don’t you check your facts?  Canadian oil is the most well regulated environmentally friendly oil in the world.  By making our nation’s oil less competitive, it is displaced by other oil from places like Russia which spills 90,000 to 360,000 barrels of oil per DAY.
382 2018-07-22 22:59:00 Life tip: When living with an Italian-American, don’t touch the olive oil. If you have to, put it back where you found it.

On a high shelf.
Behind the rice.
And not tell your short Italian-American wife.

432 2018-07-22 22:50:31 do you have spices and stuff?? and herbs or soy sauce and olive oil
433 2018-07-22 22:50:28 Awesome to see a big movie star not embarrassed to say he went to Wal Mart. We take all of our vehicles there for oil changes, etc. They do a great job!  #respect
434 2018-07-22 22:49:55 What kind of oil do they use to fry chips where you are? McDonald’s had the franchise on tasty chips because they used edible beef fat...so yummy and SO bad for you. 
435 2018-07-22 22:49:50 That's the rest of Within The Oil laid out. I hope people like the special one as much as the rest.

440 2018-07-22 22:48:19 Is that sweat or oil? This is different.
441 2018-07-22 22:48:11 Hardly any of mine were oil and gas. Just taking the format and going with shares I like  Actually, I think the only oil and gas play on my list was #upl. Sorry for taking the thread off topic...

443 2018-07-22 22:47:50 Is was Natural Gas, not oil he was talking about. 
And his sanctions are really not that different from the ones in 2014-2016. And that ignores efforts to remove sanctions upon taking office.
And the missile system replaced w/ different solution which went live in 2016
444 2018-07-22 22:47:45 Visit urgent care; they can clear them out. You can soften wax with hydrogen peroxide or olive oil in the interim.
445 2018-07-22 22:47:44 Well I found a regimen that worked for me. Weekly washes (shut took all day, had to wash in sections cause my hair is hella thick), swapped between deep conditioning and protein treatments. Used oil & leave in conditioner daily. Lots of buns & wash n go’s.
446 2018-07-22 22:47:38 Have everything prepped to make homemade chicken tenders and then realized I have no oil

461 2018-07-22 22:44:48 Drinking water? Oil by rail is 5x times as likely to spill/pollute 100's of rivers/lakes as rail cars pass by daily. Pipelines r far safer.
462 2018-07-22 22:44:45 Can you imagine how little the pound will be worth without the backing of exports of whisky and north sea oil?
463 2018-07-22 22:44:36 So energy companies drill for oil and thus pay into the fund, correct?
1) Are oil drillers not taxpayers?
2) The cost to the company is passed on to the consumer. Thus anyone who buys energy from one of these companies pays for it. Likely a vast majority of American taxpayers.

469 2018-07-22 22:43:28 I had that happen once, but I had to have a pro do it, because I could change my oil, change a tire, and keep up with basic engine maintenance, but I was terrified of fucking up brakes/rotors.

488 2018-07-22 22:40:52 I’m an environmentalist but also a realist. Oil is used for more than just fuel. The pipeline is the most economical and environmentally sensible way to move the oil. It is essentially a twining of an existing pipeline. Much safer than by rail.

500 2018-07-22 22:38:43 Doesn't bother me at all. We have always had stocks of crude oil and products squirrelled away. Other commodities too, probably. I'd expect no less. Oh, and the EU sponsors the Intervention Board which stores grain etc, but that's OK of course.
501 2018-07-22 22:38:40 A mí lo que me funcionó fueron las anticonceptivas y dejar los lácteos, pero no sé qué efectos tendría en ti. Y me pongo protector solar 50 de eucerin oil control, que me deja la piel suave y protegida.

506 2018-07-22 22:38:10 There’s nothing wrong with old people Jay.  I used an oil lamp to light the fairways back in the late teens when I was playing with Francis Ouimet and Harry Vardon. And when I triple bogied I lit up my hickory shaft and used it as a tiki torch. It worked pretty darn well

526 2018-07-22 22:33:56 My theory goes more like: PoW == gravity and BTC is like oil, since the whole crypto economy runs on it. It's rather hard to get your hands on practically any altcoin without going through BTC first. I'm not complaining about either, just trying to state a conclusion I've drawn.

553 2018-07-22 22:28:32 I disagree about that, scientific journals I have read seem to present overwhelming evidence.  I've only seen crankish science (often paid for by oil companies) disputing it.  Regardless, you didn't comment on the other delights capitalism brought the world....

578 2018-07-22 22:24:22 Getting yourself wet over the thought of all that oil huh? (which is part of the current problems) Military intervention, by who? The U.S.? That worked out so well in the 70's & 80's with setting up all of the fascist dictatorships. Tell me how much you love Pinochet.

580 2018-07-22 22:23:59 Today's westerners are in many cases in fear day to day. They take what they can get and struggle by. The newspaper industry has been in rapid decline for maybe 10 years now. High oil prices and the internet ran many papers out of money. Fear of change is sometimes parallelizing.

584 2018-07-22 22:23:38 Utter nonsense. You not know what you’re talking about. Just the point of North Sea oil, we didn’t have as much in our waters for 55million people as Norway for 4million. Norway hardly used any as has hydroelectric power.That’s a totally vacuous point. Unions destroyed industry.
585 2018-07-22 22:23:35 Remember when they taught us in school that oil came from the dead dinosaurs

589 2018-07-22 22:22:57 This doesn’t make sense.  If there were not enough paying customers to keep the service going, why is it governments job to step in.  The market for this type of service clearly isn’t there. Why not try to get oil flowing instead.

600 2018-07-22 22:20:53 It’s a essential oil that you can sniff if you feel stressed or needs something relaxing. Jackson used it before.

616 2018-07-22 22:17:03 That’s the quintessential oil trader. It’s a case of converting one physical commodity for another one at state expense.  I’m just confused about the conversion rate and scale - deal size, tenor , setttlement dates etc. Nigeria don suffer.

712 2018-07-22 22:01:41 Texas caviar: corn, black beans, minced tomato, chopped green onions, chopped cilantro, salt, olive oil and lime juice.  Very pretty when served in Belgian endive “canoes.”
713 2018-07-22 22:01:38 @Jacob_Rees_Mogg I wouldn’t be so complacent if I were you.  In 2000 a small and short-lived picket of oil depots caused major and rapid disruption to supplies of food and fuel.  Doubtless you’re stocked up but few have your resources #WestminsterHour
714 2018-07-22 22:01:25 I accuse Colonel Chili oil of committing the crime in the in the tavern with the rope!
715 2018-07-22 22:01:16 You're welcome my dear. 

We're suffering from the media black out about what is happening #Yemen?!

Saudi-UAE are paying a lot of money and oil to hide the facts.!

Many ppl in the world think Saudi-UAE evils are helping us, but in the reality we're being slaughtered by them.!
716 2018-07-22 22:01:03 I’ve done that too - jalapeño oil in my eye

718 2018-07-22 22:00:56 Just wait until it's had the final tweaks and a coat of oil. It will be officially unveiled at Picnic in the Park on the 4th August.
719 2018-07-22 22:00:53 @CNN @FoxNews @MSNBC @BBCWorld @Reuters @youngturksrec You smeared @DrJillStein when she warned about vaccines. Turns out she was right about everything huh.

725 2018-07-22 22:00:19 Essential Oil Tip: If you make your own blends, store your oils in amber-glass bottles. Amber-colored bottles protect the oils from damaging ultraviolet light & the glass is strong enough for certain oils and blends like citrus oils that may dissolve plastic. #essentialoils
726 2018-07-22 22:00:18 I only get my oil changed ~once a year. I don’t drive enough anymore to change it more frequently.
727 2018-07-22 22:00:17 Guy, they beat a soldier.
728 2018-07-22 22:00:11 Last time I went to the oil change place, they refused to give me my car back unless I bought a new battery. Except the problem was actually the cables & connections, and the installation made it WORSE until I found a real mechanic
729 2018-07-22 22:00:10 Its underway,these crooks are gonna Rob the Gulf Nations,mark my words,its in the infancy stages.

734 2018-07-22 21:58:54 "For one thing, had George W. Bush told Saddam to either share his oil wealth with ExxonMobil or face invasion, Saddam would have certainly complied."

Oh, you mean like when he complied to leave Kuwait?  What 22 year old wrote this article?
735 2018-07-22 21:58:44 I'm already familiar with how well @Honda builds products. Our daughter is still driving a 2008 Fit Sport she got new and in 15 months aside from gas and insurance I've spent $45 on 2017 Civic for oil change and tire rotation
736 2018-07-22 21:58:38 Stangle nooooooo! You fell for the "free oil change" ploy! 

You might have needed new tires anyway, but the free oil change is such a ruse. 

Did they say they can't let you leave with the tires in such bad shape?
737 2018-07-22 21:58:36 do i want to change my oil today? no
should i? yes
will i? maybe...
738 2018-07-22 21:58:29 Grated zucchini, egg, bread crumbs, shredded parmesan, finely chopped garlic, fresh snipped herbs of your choice (I like chives and basil). Mix together, fry as patties/pancakes in olive oil (making sure they are cooked through). Sprinkle with a little more parmesan. Yum.

756 2018-07-22 21:56:18 Unfortunately it doesn’t seems like it. France looks like is taking some of the oil money behind the doors, Algeria has never been fully decolonized I’m afraid.

758 2018-07-22 21:55:51 I don't do oil. Not with my skin it completely clogs up my chromataphores.
759 2018-07-22 21:55:36 Has anyone tried @milanicosmetics Moisture Lock Lip Oil Treatment? Do you like it — what are the benefits you’ve seen with using it?
760 2018-07-22 21:55:35 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
761 2018-07-22 21:55:29 Hope we both feel better tomorrow, it'll be a new day with new opportunities. I have been out of cbd oil for weeks and I sure can tell a difference without it. Sending love and hugs Jackie. Also to you all.
762 2018-07-22 21:55:26 Exactly! I think my skin is in the best condition it’s ever been, through pure fear of stretch marks  I’ve used the tummy rub oil, tummy rub butter and pregnancy boob tube, the bath oil is amazing too

Went back to the kitchen about 15 minutes later, thinking the oil will be plenty hot -- and thinking it's weird I can't smell the hot oil.

Yeah, it wasn't plugged in. gah
772 2018-07-22 21:54:08 They should and I base my opinion of them on that. People of character wouldn’t work for a snake oil salesman.

774 2018-07-22 21:53:50 Yeah Marilyn, Iran's bark is worse than it's bite. But they can still cause trouble.
The question is, will China help Iran as they get much of their oil from them.
China AND the Deep State, often working together, are the 'Wild Cards' in this scenario.
Both can attack inside US
775 2018-07-22 21:53:24 Here you go:

* 1 can San marzano tomatoes
* 4 to 8 gloves grated fresh garlic
* 3 tbps olive oil
* Crushed red pepper
* Salt 
* Herbs

Saute grated garlic in oil. Add tomatoes and salt. Cook 10 minutes, puree, add herbs. Key is to finely grate garlic. Cook to desired thickness.

781 2018-07-22 21:52:45 You're right.. here's another one. An prominent reason why Haiti is in its current status is due to the United States' fear of the power it truly has. An island country with gold ($2.1 billion to be exact), silver, and even oil assets, the United States seized control for a min..
782 2018-07-22 21:52:05 Of course its a creature just like you n I ,it doesn't fit some criteria to be referred to as a full fledge baby biologically,so whichever way u want it analyzed is embedded in here fr u.Thank you

784 2018-07-22 21:51:25 I seem to remeber reading some where that sand eel oil was used for power stations in Denmark is this correct?
785 2018-07-22 21:50:55 Well I'll be real with you.  If government doesn't do anything, industry, will develop the technology and sell it.  China almost bought a major player in the oil and nuclear sector.  I'm glad Trudeau didn't allow it - I didn't want to work for China.
786 2018-07-22 21:50:48   Hey Comey, don't  yourself. Socialists OWN the Democrat party! Look at what @BarackObama did to medical care. Review what @RepMaxineWaters said she wanted to do with the oil industry. Look at @BernieSanders. I think you've lost your mind!

820 2018-07-22 21:45:19 Shiny rocks, scraps of paper and puddles of oil have no intrinsic value.  Our ability to comprehend and develop processes that create purpose and improve lives epitomize real wealth.  If allowed, our collective intellect can solve any problem.

851 2018-07-22 21:41:16 Where is the equally intense discussion and INVESTMENT in Renewable Energy.... Talk of the phase-back of Oil and Coal, and proportionate Phase-in of Renewables: Solar,Wind?   Phase-out of Animal Agriculture for Plant-based Agriculture ?
852 2018-07-22 21:41:06 Thank you! I used to be SUPER self conscious until I got my oil under control.
853 2018-07-22 21:40:38 Yes same happened to me. I finally found out olive oil was the only thing that stopped the burning

858 2018-07-22 21:39:32 Don’t hold your breath. The oil lobbies are hard at work.

862 2018-07-22 21:38:44 Correct
863 2018-07-22 21:38:30 Much like Air Force One
864 2018-07-22 21:38:28 Which “socialism” are we talking about: an oil company making $50 billion and not paying any tax, a farmer getting incentive payments to not plant crops, a member of Congress taking away healthcare from people while enjoying government healthcare?!?
865 2018-07-22 21:37:56 Olive Oil and Balsamic tips:

Cooking with and Finishing with are different.  Budget wisely
866 2018-07-22 21:37:53 Iran is threatening to block the strait of Hormuz. 18m barrels of oil pass there a day. That's about a third of all seaborne oil transport.

The closure, or even conflict in that region will make oil PRICES skyrocket.

I can see Nigerian politicians smiling already.
867 2018-07-22 21:37:39 Not to mention with the amount of money that, goes into sources like. Oil and. Gas and the coal industry(smaller than JCPenny btw.. fuckin JCPenny) it wouldn't take long to transition America into green energy
868 2018-07-22 21:37:34 I dress like I religiously smoke misty cigarettes like to oil paint and live by the beach and I don’t give a single fuck

Spoon out the mixture into the hot oil and fry until cooked and crispy
Wished I could send

882 2018-07-22 21:35:51 Cooking oil my dude! Got it off pretty quick
883 2018-07-22 21:35:42 At a Women of the ELCA conference the keynote speaker claimed that there was a rivalry between the church of Mary M and the church of Peter so they started the rumor of Mary M being the same Mary of the oil. Patriarchy.
884 2018-07-22 21:35:26 We can grow upscale product, but we cannot afford the $50,000 machines to make oil. Oil is pushing out the bud.
885 2018-07-22 21:35:22 I added a new aromatherapy oil to my rotation: sweet orange/jojoba oil. It's a scent linked hard to memories of writing my first fanfic and reading books I loved.

890 2018-07-22 21:34:53 Have said all along that Trump is a snake oil salesmen.  It is time to run him out-of-Town.

893 2018-07-22 21:34:30 It's so much easier to get images out on that page compared to words. I bought myself oil pastels and black paper hehe. I'm not feeling much so I'm ready to try to not not approve.
894 2018-07-22 21:34:23 How to cook in our house: 
1) heat skillet of olive oil to 700 degrees 
2) erect stepladder
3) summit to 12 feet with plate of still-damp zucchini slices
4) execute flying elbow onto stove
895 2018-07-22 21:34:17 Climate change is yesterday's news. Fake data, used to intimidate oil companies to pony up cash to support globalism.
More liberal nonsense.
896 2018-07-22 21:34:12 It’s the same machine as yours... I pretty much copied everything you have. . Same filter, same everything. I split my 5 grams pulverized C60 up into a few different oils but  am focusing on the Konecki Olive oil’s first.
897 2018-07-22 21:34:10 Yup....in a perfect world, employees would work for free like MLM reps.  McDonalds could make their staff pay for the utilities and cooking oil used to make fries.
898 2018-07-22 21:34:09 My new jam/obsession is M&S anchovy fillets in chilli oil 
899 2018-07-22 21:33:46 Too much oil in the skillet + flipped the chicken too recklessly
900 2018-07-22 21:33:40 I had a creaky octalink BB on my alu Allez, but no crank extractor. I just took the bottle cage bolt out, put some oil in to seep down into the BB shell, and job done!
901 2018-07-22 21:33:37 you (may it be the distant day!) and dout the light whereby you read
in the Sacred Book for the oil too has run low, and so with a tranquil
heart to bed, to rest. He knows and will call in His own good time.
902 2018-07-22 21:33:28 No! 

Never get oil changed at a dealer!!   They rip you off "bigly"
903 2018-07-22 21:32:59 And loud. By the way, do you know where all the oil went?
904 2018-07-22 21:32:55 You absolutely should always replace both together. Otherwise you’re leaving a lot of the old oil behind. Also, those prices are outrageous IMHO.
905 2018-07-22 21:32:55 I need to change my oil but it’s too  hottt
906 2018-07-22 21:32:28 PS: Do not even consider synthetic oil until you pass 100K. ie; well passed... 

And even then you probably dont need it unless you know you are burning a lot of oil. I only went 'synthetic' on my last vehicle at 175K.
907 2018-07-22 21:32:21 Look like he dipped his head in some petroleum oil
908 2018-07-22 21:32:17 Any dirty oil used in making that sign? Hypocrite.
909 2018-07-22 21:32:11 Oil and a bit of sugar as an abrasive.
910 2018-07-22 21:31:51 Basically, Venezuela is anti-Israel and has lot she of oil so the NWO have tried to wipe out socialism there but the people elected their own guy they love. Globalist corporatists have worked against them, starving them and forcing violence to take the country.
911 2018-07-22 21:31:31 A bunch of us have said from the beginning Tillerson / Exxon was about freeing up Russia’s oil that Putin is desperate for (aka lift sanctions) & Exxon has the patents needed for Russia drilling  @RepMaxineWaters #TrumpPutin #TrumpKnew #12Russians #1MillionVeteransMarch

931 2018-07-22 21:27:24 Do you add supplements into your keto diet? As I understand it is mostly based on fats and proteins, how do you ensure you receive proper nutrients you would otherwise obtain from grains and vegetables? Also, have you heard of MCT oil & if so do you use it?

934 2018-07-22 21:26:33 Exports will continue as normal if devaluation mitigates tariffs-imports however like oil will become more expensive - I think RMB slide is more to do with US growth and interest rates but Beijing may be happy to let it slide a little further to prove a point to Washington.

946 2018-07-22 21:25:14 Any essential oil gurus out there? Diffusing lemongrass in the kitchen to eradicate the smell of the salmon I cooked for lunch. Not so much touching it. What else works??
947 2018-07-22 21:25:14 Those prices are nuts. Should be about $50 for oil and filter.  

And yeah - no way do you change oil w/o changing the filter.
948 2018-07-22 21:25:12 I bet Shoygu is not happy with Vova & Peskov starting what may come close to war. When Trump facts hit he'll be removed by Congress Then they will seek revenge. I see full export controls like #DPRK or Cuba. Then CIA starts Buryat Liberation Front guerilla army. Grab oil.

953 2018-07-22 21:24:04 I’m vegan so that helps. Haha!

But I grate it and add it to spaghetti and chilli. Grilled zukes with a little oil and pepper are

955 2018-07-22 21:23:17 My boss who i worked with in the 70's said to me all wars are to do with is oil and gas we can add centralised bank to that. He also said the west would be waisting it's time taking on the Syrians you can't beat them, wise words.
956 2018-07-22 21:23:06 It was great for Putin. You sold the soul of the United States to Putin you opportunistic bloated snake oil salesman.
957 2018-07-22 21:23:05 Not a oil guy. So don’t take much for granted. So the rig productivity falloff could is indeterminate. Could be same or worse than UAE, Kuwait. Iraq looks strong though.

959 2018-07-22 21:22:50 What exactly do you mean by a holistic approach? I ask because I see that term frequently used with alternative medical treatments have have no peer reviewed science behind them, and are basically snake oil.
960 2018-07-22 21:22:39 Going to try and make it to Woodlands for the book signing.  I have a home in the North Cypress (Greater Houston) area but currently working in Odessa Texas (Oil and gas).  Hey - maybe you should come to Odessa,.  I can who you all the Sand Hills here

963 2018-07-22 21:22:24 peed off rn cuz my fav almond butter brand started using palm oil
964 2018-07-22 21:22:22 Your inference is quite wrong ma'am. At least, that's what your prayer looks like. Assuming that the problem is coming from females isn't quite cool. As far as I know, it's not been proven to be an X-linked disorder.
965 2018-07-22 21:22:16 So what is the effect of the vitamin supplement industry harvesting krill for krill oil? Is this creating additional pressure on whales and other sea life? Should we be getting our supplements from algae? What is the least harmful source of Omega 3s for vegans and vegetarians?
966 2018-07-22 21:22:14 I dunno why my mom always reaches out to me when her car does something weird but I’m seriously considering a career in mechanics after I just successfully changed her oil

970 2018-07-22 21:21:15 News flash.  Governments dont only legislate on campaign promises.  NDP said they'd explore their options, meet with industry, decided on carbon tax, which oil and gas sector had been pushing for for years.
971 2018-07-22 21:21:11 N700m? That should be Okey Wali I guess. Only oil money can come correct like that.
972 2018-07-22 21:21:10 If you don't mind, .... I won't hold my breath.

What do you suppose the oil industry paid or will pay Trump to put in a crook like Scott Pruitt?
His salary is noise in that equation.

980 2018-07-22 21:19:28 Is the first one using conventional oil and the bottom one using synthetic? I don't know why the main one wouldn't include a filter, but I can see the price difference between conventional and synthetic. Our Subaru dealer bumped synthetic changes to 80 or 90 bucks. :(

“The old story of keeping your enemies close” referring to Putin.
We don’t need Iran for oil, Trump is gonna get it from Texas.
990 2018-07-22 21:18:05 My sisters kids came over and all I smell is her ex husband. My brother is always over and I know his smell. I have a hard time with a foreign smell in my house. I’m like yew turn on my oil burners and spray my house with fragrance.
991 2018-07-22 21:17:56 i was just mixing in vitamin e oil for a bit! but it has a weird smell so i also mix in bio oil bc it smells rosy and i already had it lol  but you could probably mix in like any essential oil that you like. there’s probably ones that could help w skin too!
992 2018-07-22 21:17:20 Living on the Ogun axis & seeing as its the peak of rainy season, we sometimes pump what looks like fine sea sand. I'm just here wondering what some Lagosians & the down south south peeps in deep oil zones pump as clean water.
993 2018-07-22 21:17:15 The secret to happiness is to see all the marvels of the world, and never to forget the drops of oil on the spoon.
994 2018-07-22 21:17:15 Know the feeling- I had an op a few years ago and my weight just dropped too much during recovery, try snacking on pistachios, putting olive oil on as much as you can, spinach and ( if you can stomach them) dates
995 2018-07-22 21:17:13 This them Davido family is like they have one kind oyel in their long head. Pls Where can I find the palm tree the oil pours from abeg?
996 2018-07-22 21:17:03 We have socialism for the Rich, Corporations & Wall St, just table scraps for the middle class & poor, I get you. Trickle up economics is what we have & you guys love that socialism, Tax breaks other people have to pay for, subsidies, (welfare) for Oil companies that don't need
997 2018-07-22 21:16:53 Surprised to see this happening again this night because 2 days ago,  We lost a Kwaran to those faceless killers along that same route.. 

This guy was killed after writing his final papers by unknown gun men

1001 2018-07-22 21:16:09 It would be in your best interest to learn how to at least check the oil and add oil if needed and what kind is needed. Also, learn to look for spots on your driveway or yard indicating leaks.

There will be a YouTube video probably for your exact make and model on how to do so.
1002 2018-07-22 21:15:54 Yes, please remain centrist, pro-war, pro-CIA torture and Russia-gate propaganda,  pro-Wall Street, pro-Big Oil, pro-Big Pharma, pro-student debt, pro-predatory lending, against single payer healthcare, etc..so we can soon get rid of you and the GOP altogether.
1003 2018-07-22 21:15:51 If I know absolutely nothing about cars, should I attempt to learn to change my own oil from YouTube videos or should I just go to a mechanic
1004 2018-07-22 21:15:44 I also noticed I don’t get oily. And when I gave myself 1 week break of using it, my face begins to produce oil. I’m always make up free tho
1005 2018-07-22 21:15:42 In 2014, $1 = circa N185. Today, $1 = circa N360. Could you please convert the Nairs value to $. When you sell crude oil in $ and spend in N, the diff is clear.
1006 2018-07-22 21:15:30 Hear hear.. I grew up on Cold Press Coconut oil.. it did not harm me!!

1013 2018-07-22 21:14:51 Explain again, I did not get it. 
What I meant is that he supports Erdogan. 
Erdogan is killing Kurds and Turkey is far away from being a democracy and imprisoned journalists. He supports ISIL / Daesh by buying oil from them. What is not racist about that?
1014 2018-07-22 21:14:46 I didn't even played that I was another time i get castor oil for worldbuilding omg yeah i need a juicy burger from a lot
1015 2018-07-22 21:14:29 Steamed carrots with tarragon, steamed turnip mashed with chives and carmeluzed garlic and a little butter, sautéed zucchini with the garlic, pepper and sea salt and just a little grape seed oil that was leftover from cooking the garlic.
1016 2018-07-22 21:14:24 Yeah, I’ve used the baby Aveeno and it’s not bad. The best thing I’ve found is a stupidly expensive bath oil, which is not convenient!
1017 2018-07-22 21:14:15 wonder 8 oil is still out here kicking
1018 2018-07-22 21:13:53 The money was invested wisely but only a fool would believe that any clubs top assets cannot be bought by oil money !! PSG 220m for neymar !! What’s salah worth or Kane ???

1024 2018-07-22 21:12:53 I merely speak of blocking the strait. How is the oil business?
1025 2018-07-22 21:12:48 It was half of revelations bath oil with half of twilight (i think that was the name..) bath bomb. ♡♡♡ smells super good.
1026 2018-07-22 21:12:42 Besides that, trying to link The NRA with Russian Socialism is like trying to mix oil with water.
1027 2018-07-22 21:12:26 Besides, We Know Where Many Of Your Facilities Are! You Guys Upset Because We Don’t Need Your Oil Anymore? 
Well, This Gives You An Answer , Why We Don’t Want It.

We Are Now Producing More Than Enough Oil, So We Can Take Some Of Your Business!!

1029 2018-07-22 21:11:58 That’s satisfying feeling when you have changed the wheel bearing on your car with your dad then changed your own oil... saving yourself $500. So glad he taught me how to do those things and to have your own garage to do it in... feels good.
1030 2018-07-22 21:11:52 if I go to the supermarket and buy the 50p value brand peanut butter I have to stir that after like a day or two because the oil has separated out of it, does that count

1045 2018-07-22 21:09:59 It was fun trying to get the oil off the textured slate floor but happily it doesn’t look too much the worse for its experience. A lucky escape all round.
1046 2018-07-22 21:09:53 We know he's doesn't control OPEC prices but doesn't he oversee economic policies which have influence on fluctuation of the Rands which makes it expensive to import oil.

If  we achieve rapid economic growth (5%GDP) for example, he will take credit.

1051 2018-07-22 21:08:41 i put bio oil on my scar on my knee ever night and i have for a few weeks and it literally STILL keeps opening up

1069 2018-07-22 21:05:21 I wonder when free oil money from gulf region( including Iran) dries up, how would these morons survive?
welfare? crime? both?
1070 2018-07-22 21:05:18 DPR is the lead regulator of the oil and gas sector in Nigeria. Not a partner doing business with oil companies as implied here.
1071 2018-07-22 21:05:10 We all know now why Trump doesn't promote clean energy. Because Russia's prime exports are oil and gas. It's so obvious.
1072 2018-07-22 21:05:02 I don't speak dead of the ill, but I do speak ill of the dead.  Billy Graham was a snake oil salesman who got obscenely rich and passed the snake oil business on to @franklin_graham.
1073 2018-07-22 21:04:59 When my parents sent me a package of Essential Oils, I don’t think they thought I would use peppermint oil to soak my cigarettes and make Homemade Menthols
1074 2018-07-22 21:04:52 I am ashamed to say I am an utter girl when it comes to cars.  I don’t even know how to change oil or put water in. That’s bad isn’t it???? I just smile at someone at the garage and they do it for me 
1075 2018-07-22 21:04:27 is all about oil and selling arms with the USA, without selling arms USA wouldn't be rich. it has to be war so all arms manufacturers can survive.

1078 2018-07-22 21:03:52 This is Nothing more then propaganda to push up the oil price. US applies sanctions to stop other countries buy oil from Iran, and then Iran propaganda says They will close straight of HormuZ, then oil price goes up. Everyone happy once again.
1079 2018-07-22 21:03:48 Stratecic crypto money is a dream, people who do not create jobs.
gold, silver or oil is the current investment.
1080 2018-07-22 21:03:14 On the contrary, nothing in the dossier has been disproven yet. Many of the claims have been verified. Page met with Russian oil Co., Rosneft, to discuss sanctions, Kremlin targeted swing state voters, Trump has ties to Russian businessman, Agalarov. All proven true.
1081 2018-07-22 21:03:06 As opposed to say, Cuba, which gets subsidised oil from Venezuela & also has heavy dependency on road?

Those damned Castros, eh? Vicious capitalists. 

The former USSR ran on magic beans & Stalin’s personal methane emissions, I’ll admit though
1082 2018-07-22 21:03:05 Not at home they are not but there is more to US policy than just domestic affairs. Additionally, the left-right spectrum isn't entirely about social questions. It is primarily about economics.

ISIS isn't trying to steal oil, destroy unions and empower the wealthy.
1083 2018-07-22 21:03:00 1. Make sure they are completely dry when taking them down 
2. Make sure you’re twisting in the same direction
3. Coat fingers with oil to eliminate frizz.
1084 2018-07-22 21:02:51 So Scotland can dismantle all infrastructure in England paidnwith Scottish oil when they leave U.K. ??
1085 2018-07-22 21:02:49 It's time to seriously consider hemp production. Plastics can be made from hemp just as they are from oil. The difference is hemp plastic biodegrade. I know their intentions are good but if you're really going to fix the problem go to the cause
1086 2018-07-22 21:02:32 yes but they're loosely based on historical ones (or generic if you're playing an offbeat country like Brazil) - the slow production for no oil is an abstraction, i'm not actually building sailing ships
1087 2018-07-22 21:02:24 Wouldn't trying to make everyone the same be awful? Still, there are inequalities that hurt people and that no amount of meritorious behavior explains. This matters to me. Getty said "Rise Early, Work Late and Strike Oil." Most people work hard like that. Time doesn't heal that.
1088 2018-07-22 21:01:44 What about this car you don't  like my little Chevy a little bit bigger weight 2,280 pounds easy to park cheap maintenance great on gas I use Red Line Synthetic Oil 36 city 52 hwy. These tiny cars take up not a lot of space

1101 2018-07-22 21:00:03 Vegetable oil or sunflower oil.  Avoid oil with flavour like olive or nut oil.  You could substitute with butter or avocado, but that complicates things...  stick with oil 
1102 2018-07-22 20:59:58 You know, except the activists who’ve spent their entire careers building up this party only to have a snake oil salesman from VT try and take it from them
1103 2018-07-22 20:59:51 seems rather that the US uses the Israelis to assert dominance and keep th globalists in control of the oil spigot
1104 2018-07-22 20:59:40 Oil did the right thing. Germany should be grateful for him choosing them over Turkey. They even got the best version of him
1105 2018-07-22 20:59:28 You get to do a cooling system flush.  You'll need to flush it with Seafoam or another oil detergent.   Even if you didn't run it, the difference in specific gravity will mean it will likely mix
1106 2018-07-22 20:59:24 Tesla is noted for its electric cars but the most significant development may be in energy storage.  This will impact electric energy producers, oil producers and coal producers. Storing renewable energy has been the missing link.

1118 2018-07-22 20:55:50 Unfortunately our hands are tied in the usa. We live under the thumb of king trump. He has sold the suckers the snake oil and they love it.
1119 2018-07-22 20:55:35 Same reason he will destroy oil and gas along with the auto sector ...... read the PARIS ACCORD
1120 2018-07-22 20:55:32 This doesn’t include those oligarchs who fell out of favor and escaped. Putin simply declared them enemies and than steals their money and companies. That’s why he wants oil sanctions lifted so bad and that’s just 1 of many companies/ people he stole billions from
1121 2018-07-22 20:55:31 I was a fry cook at a dive bar in South Seattle. Dude wanted raw chicken gizzards. He sent back two orders. I dropped the third order in the oil for under ten seconds and he said they were perfect.

A good example is TY Danjuma. Imagine having to give up his oil wells in the Niger Delta because the farce Nigeria no longer exists.

1137 2018-07-22 20:51:37 Believe me, I thought about that, but someone is probably on a no carb diet.  So, it’s chicken scallopini, roasted red potatoes w/olive oil & rosemary, and tossed salad. And, more importantly: Sauvignon Blanc, Cab. Sauvignon , and beer (pale, amber & wheat ales & Belgium tripels)

1151 2018-07-22 20:47:40 I was feeling so bad about my skin and falling off my routine wagon that I ordered 200ml of tea tree oil and wow I literally have enough to last me until the world ends.
1152 2018-07-22 20:47:17 It's now also dawned on me that Trump's uproar about Germany's oil & gas deal with Russia could also be tied to this somehow. 
1153 2018-07-22 20:47:16 That said, it would be quite a lark to see Marina colorize a black-and-white oil painting.

1157 2018-07-22 20:46:52 The Al-Yamamah trade deal of arms for oil signed in 1985 is one such deal. Still a trade deal, still negotiated for Britain, not by the EU. By any distinction it is a trade deal.
1158 2018-07-22 20:46:41 That is just so daft.  You'd rather be constrained by oil companies that want to squeeze the life out of the planet;  yet I'm quite certain you're happy to use the science that has granted you your cell phone, your GPS, and the Twitter account you posted this on.
1159 2018-07-22 20:46:34 All of Wayne Thibaud’s paintings look so lifelike they make me wanna cut the desserts right out of the composition and eat oil paint like Van Gogh

1161 2018-07-22 20:46:11 My car looks like nobody loves it. My baby needs a wash. Paint job. New shoes. A new mirror. A oil change and a full tank of gas. Allaaattttt shit.
1162 2018-07-22 20:45:58 I made the last of my skinny noodle stuff because I had enough basil to make a pesto for it. Probably used too much oil to be considered “low calorie” but whatever. Maybe I won’t eat that banana to make up for it.
1163 2018-07-22 20:45:40 Hi Kassie - We have responded to your Facebook comment. Your friend need not be alarmed. It's a mixture of oil and crumbs that can sometimes form during packaging.
1164 2018-07-22 20:45:38 Russia is sitting on massive amounts of oil w/o means to drill it. Anyone who helps (hence Rex Til) via lifting sanctions providing equipment or funding stands to make massive $$$$. It's always about the oil.
1165 2018-07-22 20:45:38 I use a small ceramic coated pan, spray with oil, add water and heat, add the eggs and splash hot water on top if needed.  Love eggs Benedict.  I’m not a fan of a larger pot of water with vinegar added, method to poach.
1166 2018-07-22 20:45:35  just add some lotion or Vaseline lol maybe some oil
1167 2018-07-22 20:45:31 Oil demand will hit 100 million barrels/day in 2019 based on assumed demand growth of 1.4 million barrels/day. What about the natural decline rates of 3-5% the industry sees every year?
1168 2018-07-22 20:45:30 So you can sell Arizona's beautiful national parks to your gas and oil company friends/donors!

1186 2018-07-22 20:41:49 I read that oregano oil should be absorbed by your gums and sides of your mouth.  One to three drops on my toothbrush every morning seems to do the trick.
1187 2018-07-22 20:41:36 At home, I'm all over anything I can put on it, plus olive oil and apple cider vinegar. Out and about? No salads for me. I don't trust restaurant salads. *been in the biz and no thanks*
1188 2018-07-22 20:41:07 Your vocabulary suggests you’re educated which makes me wonder... are you so embarrassed you bought the snake oil that you have to continue supporting @realDonaldTrump to try to cover your mistake? Or do you truly believe that oil will cure all that ails you?

1200 2018-07-22 20:39:56 Not because of lack of demand. 
Because of the hosile atmosphere in Canada generated by foreign funded ENGO'S and are inability to get our oil and gas to tidewater.

1204 2018-07-22 20:39:25 .I know this is tough, but it is called the RFS and has more than ethanol, let alone corn ethanol. It is also not a mandate. And since ethanol is $.65/gal less than gasoline, how does it harm anyone other than your oil supporters?
1205 2018-07-22 20:39:15 Not sure why I said oil in this post as I had been searching watercolors all day before making this post, but I'm still more interested in finding out if it's a legit Antonio Pietro Martino. Altho I doubt I find many answers without paying someone for their trouble. Thanks Chris
1206 2018-07-22 20:39:13 Not all German are racist, but because oil took picture with a president which he might have be rude if he turn him down for photograph, and DFB make a meal out of it.. I know DFB could have done better

"Senator, what's our stance going to be on legalizing weed products."
"Are they going to put it in sex oil?"
"Sir?"
"Let's look into sex oil."
"We were talking about marijuana, sir."
"Right. Marijuana sex oil."
"Yes sir."

1290 2018-07-22 20:26:52 On a rainy day like today, I recommend an afternoon of home cheffing. Break out your apron, mix some olive oil with salt and garlic and just soak up the day.

Then turn on #LFCBVB and ENJOY some preseason.  I think we are four weeks from start of #PremierLeague!

It was a good column that reflected the journey many of us have been on over the past year.The trolling simply proves your point.

1303 2018-07-22 20:25:06 I live in Alberta and people are always freaking out about our oil sands and they want to shut them down.

1310 2018-07-22 20:24:29 Hopefully he didn't give Putin the oil fields in N. Syria! Those fields should be used to pay for reconstruction of the #SDF controlled areas and to bargain with Assad for a long term solution where we keep the SDF as allies and free from Assad & Hezbollah.
1311 2018-07-22 20:24:18 It seems like the oil industry is very happy with current prices. I bet they let prices drift up over time to allow some compensation for inflation.

1336 2018-07-22 20:21:15 Let's not kid ourselves, tax cuts = public service cuts, which have already absorbed some pretty vicious austerity cuts. More cuts = something pretty fundamental. Is this what Brexiters envisaged? Cos you can be damn sure it's what the snake oil salesmen who sold it to you did!
1337 2018-07-22 20:21:06 Thank you sir for your candid assessment. I applaud you and Steve Schmidt for exposing this fraud snake oil salesman.

1358 2018-07-22 20:18:42 Question on this, when it says oil, what kind are we talking? As I said, I don't bake much 
1359 2018-07-22 20:18:35 Every nonprofit is a nonprofit corporation, so technically it’s a corporation. 

But “corporate donor” implies a for-profit corporation or alternatively a donor group for corporate interests, like a group of bankers, insurers or oil companies. 

And yeah, they all need scrutiny.

1373 2018-07-22 20:15:33 Perhaps fish oil supplementing should be coupled with methods of reducing oxidative stress for best outcomes (lower N6 could be part of that).

1398 2018-07-22 20:13:01 The report played a blinder! It gave the shit show of all old arguments used last time & answered them! It even factored in tory austerity & NO oil.  Now unionists are dancing up & down in anger! This isnt a blueprint for indy. Its a discussion papers & assemblies being held.
1399 2018-07-22 20:12:54 they gotta look like the mcdonald's fry cook after a double shift and a week of no showering. more oil than human.

1403 2018-07-22 20:11:36 I use the Aveeno Brightening daily scrub before or after my regular cleanser (usually before) and then I use a toner and rosehip oil before moisturizer

1406 2018-07-22 20:11:05 car payment of 380 monthly, insurance 110, gas 180 monthly, oil change 70 every 3 months and 80 a month with street parking

Without owning a car I am saving 750 on a typical month

Thats 9460.0 a year

In conclusion I will not be purchasing another vehicle  
1407 2018-07-22 20:11:04 Not sure about that....
A little olive oil on that dome. Stand in the sun just right.....
Probably pretty bright.
1408 2018-07-22 20:11:03 Add fresh snipped chives.  Eat with fresh sliced tomatoes. Even better add fresh basil, parsley, minced onion & garlic, olive oil, salt & pepper to tomatoes. Small, curd, low fat, the best.
1409 2018-07-22 20:10:57 POTUS Trump has imposed the harshest sanctions on Russia than Obama or Bush, and in fact the harshest sanctions since the end of the cold war.  AND he tried to undermine Russia's oil sales to Germany during his last visit to NATO!  So what  is he to account for again? Dems Nuts.

1414 2018-07-22 20:10:08 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
1415 2018-07-22 20:10:07 The only difference between motorcycles and humans is the type of oil they use
1416 2018-07-22 20:10:05 バターとかマーガリンとか知らないけど多分吸ったぜ。
1417 2018-07-22 20:09:31 a simple solution my uncle told me, and i was so amazed that it works, is to apply olive oil to the burned area after some basic cleaning with water, if it's only a simple red marks and pain, leave the oil on the region for some time and the pain will be gone.

1420 2018-07-22 20:09:03 Yep I had an aunt that looked like a real leather. She also used oil and at times with iodine in it.
1421 2018-07-22 20:08:54 @bp22 with a baby on the way with a heart defect the oil patch life just can't be a thing anymore.  Pretty lost on a direction though
1422 2018-07-22 20:08:33 Y i k e s @ the hives
The only time I use coconut oil in my hair is when I’m twisting it bc it’s already wet. If I just do coconut oil though it definitely dries me out
1423 2018-07-22 20:08:25 the jouvert is separated by those who play in paint and those in oil,but in the midst we usually combine and have fun

1427 2018-07-22 20:07:57 So they are promising oil wells, ah ah ah, is it the ones in thier father's backyard or those in the Niger Delta. Thunder fire them a million times

1429 2018-07-22 20:07:57 It's easy, Real Madrid will not compete on the same terms as the oil clubs and do not have the same resources , Neymar is not worth 37 million euros / salary and a cost of 220 million euros , never.

1434 2018-07-22 20:07:34 Why we have oil to supply US for 100+ years. Shouldn't effect us at all. Oh wait that's wrong.

1437 2018-07-22 20:06:59 This is so simple. I wonder what stopped them announcing the verdict till 11 pm. I guess they were waiting for the denials from the companies OR they wanted to create history by burning midnight oil.
1438 2018-07-22 20:06:42 Pot is better than alcohol.
I don't smoke pot or drink alcohol.
I do take CBD oil that replaced 27 pills 3-4 times a day.
CBD is not psychotropic but even the THC in small quantities is medically beneficial. Cannabis pills Nabilone and Marinol were given to my 4 years old child.
1439 2018-07-22 20:06:35 well u gotta find out ur hair type first and then based on that u can find how to maintain that specific type other than that i'd say get non sulfate champoo/conditioner and some type of oil like argan for example depends on the cream it's also gucci

1442 2018-07-22 20:05:36 The problem with that.. take Alberta for example... low if any taxes... when oil tanked... things got bad... no diversification, nothing to fall back on... good when it's good... but it can't be sunny every day
1443 2018-07-22 20:05:33 I’m so happy in the winter when I get a fever. That means my oil bill will go down. You can’t fix stupid

1450 2018-07-22 20:04:24 I'm worried I used too much olive oil with my foccacia. I got a little crazy when Paul Hollywood told me I couldn't use too much because "foccacia is olive oil," but I may have proved him wrong. #UncleJoeyBakes

1453 2018-07-22 20:04:08 Instead of burning the midnight oil, these young boys and girls are burning classrooms and dormitories. What the hell is going on? But again, what do you expect when our 'leaders' are the likes of Murkomen.
1454 2018-07-22 20:03:54 3. Now, because of that, we have a situation where whatever man wants he just goes out and gets it. Anything stood in his way is swept aside. He has never had barriers to stop him and all are vulnerable in his wake. With his greed for oil, precious goods and technology

1457 2018-07-22 20:03:38 I like the kind of CBD oil that says full spectrum.
1458 2018-07-22 20:03:29 Russia selling their US bonds does not mean they do not trust the US to pay back its debt. It has got more to do with wanting to accumulate more gold and them not needing dollars(for oil for example) as much as they used to.
1459 2018-07-22 20:03:22 Your courgette as centrepiece of eating up the fridge.... had some little plum tomatoes & half a tub of ricotta left - roast tomatoes with garlic, salt, pepper & olive oil, slice & sauté courgette, toss all together with pasta, add ricotta & basil, serve.... and yum.
1460 2018-07-22 20:03:21 Nope! I feel that it brings out all your hard muscle work like natural oil. Oh hell, ya look good either way.

1463 2018-07-22 20:03:06 I get to spend $700-800 to fix my car, and that's not even including fixing whatever part is leaking oil, which could potentially cost biiiigg bucks

1467 2018-07-22 20:02:46 Ya never know. Ten years from now though, we'll probably be wondering why we thought it was a good idea to put coconut oil in everything.
1468 2018-07-22 20:02:44 Putting coconut oil in my ends does actually help after a few hours of looking greasy? I don’t know how many times I should do it though

1472 2018-07-22 20:01:53 I’ve been taking CBD oil made from Hemp. It has No THC in it to get you high and has extremely reduced my pain from a broken back & diabetic neuropathy. I know at least 50 people taking it and have reduced their meds or totally cut them out.
1473 2018-07-22 20:01:42 The principle commodity is the oil. The price of oil has escalated from $26 a barrel to $80 a barrel. It is this cost that effects price of food and not the value of the £ against the € which incidentally was hugely overinflated anyway.

1481 2018-07-22 20:00:52 Then will you look at it from a business perspective? Oil monopolies have their dirty fingers in the government’s butthole, and could very easily pressure Tesla into non-existence. He needs to stay on govt’s good side in order to keep pushing toward a sustainable future.
1482 2018-07-22 20:00:41 I have this REALLY INTENSE feed , solid OMG and then I get a complaint about a cup of coconut oil  . Which, maybe that will be the thing that kills us!

1499 2018-07-22 19:57:03 ...and curry powder (and more oil if needed to make a paste)
- add chopped mushrooms and fry down
- add a tin of chopped tomatoes, tomato purée, frozen peas, fresh spinach & cardamom pods
- and creamed coconut to thicken & salt to taste
- leave in the pan while you cook the rice

1511 2018-07-22 19:56:03 Pretty simple basic ingredients but it’s all about the spices with this one.
- warm coriander & caraway seeds in a pan, then bash them in pestle & mortar;
- chopped onion & fresh ginger in the pan with oil;
- add the coriander/caraway with garam masala, turmeric, chilli flakes...
1512 2018-07-22 19:56:02 I'm quite sure, he would allow to digging for oil in the Arlington cemetery if someone told him this... because the only thing that he loves more than himself is money.
1513 2018-07-22 19:56:02 No it's common knowledge  oil fucks up pool filters. They provide them with approved sun screen.

1516 2018-07-22 19:55:43 They’ve got different uses. Like I will swear by coconut oil for my lips & skin, but jojoba has definitely done wonders for my hair & I use a jojoba based “butter” for stretching my ears

1520 2018-07-22 19:55:13 The slump in sukuk issuances in 1H18 is largely reflective of the economic slump in the GCC (and wider MENA)- corporates not growing, rising US rates, market volatility, oil prices and the geopolitical environment
1521 2018-07-22 19:55:02 CBD Oil has now become so popular now that there are those who are attempting to regulate it. I recall Mitch McConnell speaking out against such regulations some time ago.
1522 2018-07-22 19:54:50 Buhari will never be a party to promise you or anyone else oil well. Never!!.
1523 2018-07-22 19:54:45 We're not sure either; inherited from my father. Possibly part of a small oil burner to go under a hotplate for keeping food warm.
1524 2018-07-22 19:54:30 Oil change was $110
1525 2018-07-22 19:54:28 the oil is for those who partake in playing "jab jab"
1526 2018-07-22 19:54:22 Ohhhhhhhhh nooooo! Why didn't this happen sooner?!? I could have used sex toy marijuana oil with #StormyDaniels and #KarenMcDougal!!
1527 2018-07-22 19:54:21 Ha ha, you don’t think Finns mine & aren’t dependent on oil? You clearly haven’t lived there.
1528 2018-07-22 19:54:20 Oh good idea. and I’ll try my oil cleanser afterwards
1529 2018-07-22 19:54:08 I posted a photo of me doing an oil change on my car and already I’m getting mobil1 ads on my insta feed. This isn’t an algorithm, this is Jeff from the CIA stalking my shit!

1532 2018-07-22 19:53:53 If someone had told Lady Macbeth to use coconut oil and a little bit of salt that play would've ended at act IV.
1533 2018-07-22 19:53:50 Cook your own! Use thin slices of different veges, spray

lightly with light cooking oil and dust with spices and

or herbs. Oven cook.
1534 2018-07-22 19:53:49 Everyone has a right to refuse treatment, if they understand what that means. 

But the snake oil salesmen who prey on the hopes (and bank balances) of the sick and vulnerable are beyond the pale. 

A reminder of how the worst amongst us prosper.
1535 2018-07-22 19:53:41 If he wanted to raise oil prices for Russia he wouldn’t have opened up ANWR, offshore drilling or fracking on federal lands... it was a bad deal.
1536 2018-07-22 19:53:30 People swear coconut oil is it but really jojoba oil is the best

1538 2018-07-22 19:53:10 Health care costs are on Obama and the debacle he created. Talk to OPEC and Russia about rising crude oil prices when they colluded to cut production to artificially raise them.
The tariff war is temporary, they will cave before we do. Wages flat?
How about historical employment?
1539 2018-07-22 19:53:04 We avoid brexit with independence, negotiate a membership with the EU that protects our fishing, oil, etc - & allows us access to the SM, FM, ECJ & CU.
We would then hoover up all those businesses that were deserting the rUK and allow them to remain in the SM.
Simple really.
1540 2018-07-22 19:52:57 scared oil heater makes you soused
1541 2018-07-22 19:52:56 Chicken. I pound out 3 chicken breasts & sprinkle a season salt with orange & lemon rind on both sides & sautee them in olive oil for 6 minutes a side, let them cool & chop then into small chunks.
1542 2018-07-22 19:52:42 Actually you’re right we never colonised you, but we did occupy the south whilst the Soviet took the north so we could use your oil for our war effort. As for suck a dick, your profile pic looks like you’ve had more practice than me. Raiders 
1543 2018-07-22 19:52:30 Sesame oil is <3
1544 2018-07-22 19:52:24 Is that why they were told not to go in the pool? Because of the oil?
1545 2018-07-22 19:52:22 Hey @Marriott , First night, discover TV doesn't work or connect right, second night I've got roaches in my shower, the following morning my room service takes over an hour and shows up undercooked and drowning in oil. What gives?
1546 2018-07-22 19:51:46 Eventually I would like to see us move off oil completely but in order for that to happen first we must control the market.

1549 2018-07-22 19:51:11 Sex workers' bodies aren't quite equivalent to cotton gins or oil drills... They are humans that suffer and labor and so forth. I think it's a misreading of Marx's theory of the commodity and of the distinction between capitalists and workers to equate the two.
1550 2018-07-22 19:51:02 Ooh you right I didn’t think about jojoba oil
As far as the coconut oil & shea butter, it’s just a tiny bit, but you’re right jojoba would be better for her
1551 2018-07-22 19:51:00 You know the bread you dip in olive oil that you get before the main course at Italian restaurants...? That’s what you’re gonna get on Friday! #thedinnercomessoon #album

1553 2018-07-22 19:50:54 Thrown in your face, I’d wager, by people who are far less informed than you. Gusanos are enraged that Chavez spent the country’s oil surplus on programs that lifted millions out of dire poverty, and are now able to participate in electoral politics where they solidly back Maduro
1554 2018-07-22 19:50:39 We only went cos it was a cheap as chips holiday and ultimately total shit. Remember one waiter having a panic because we ordered fish and he said “it comes in oil and lots of garlic and has bones”. No shit Sherlock were in Spain by the sea and ordered fish.

1558 2018-07-22 19:49:31 Singapore.

I guess you could say that modern shipping depends on oil for fuel, but that’s a bit of a stretch.

Also: South Korea, Japan, Israel, Iceland, Finland, Sweden... probably a ton of others

1564 2018-07-22 19:49:00 I really wish we El on musk weren't so disappointing not because I was ever a particular fan, but because I want an all-electric car and I want to destroy oil companies
1565 2018-07-22 19:48:55 If there’s one thing that annoys me so much is when people who know I don’t smoke hmu saying “I got oil lmk if u need that” or “bud on deck hmu” Like STOP IM NOT BUYING I DONT SMOKE.

1573 2018-07-22 19:48:05 I think it's, with respect, a misreading of Marx's theory of the commodity to refer to SWers' bodies as the means of production as though they were equivalent to cotton gins or oil drills
1574 2018-07-22 19:48:01 Armagh: M1 west-bound near Craigavon and M12 south-bound are affected by an oil spill.  Drivers should approach with caution.

1576 2018-07-22 19:47:37 A year? I’ve been at it since 2002! I lived in Qatar for 2 years and watched Al Jazeera while there! Saw a bunch of anti Canadian documentaries produced by the Trudeau brothers! Gulf countries, Saudi, Israel, Jordan (not sure about Turkey)are all in cahouts in Syria for the oil!
1577 2018-07-22 19:47:20 I’ve had to spray neme(?) oil on Halen’s tail and mane to stop flies from getting them and making him itchy and boy is that stuff stinky #equinehour

1592 2018-07-22 19:45:15 I'm really disappointed you're letting China take the lead on green energy. Pollution from oil coal and gas is going to force us to switch to alternatives. You're letting them rule the future. Please change your policies and make America #1 in this area.

And

4- How much USA won  true selling misiles ?
5- USA wants to return to cold war time ?
1598 2018-07-22 19:44:56 I’m that person who chats with the grocery store clerk about people watching and the difference between olive oil/butter/sesame oil-people while you’re impatiently shoving your margarine down the conveyor belt and giving her the stink eye.
1599 2018-07-22 19:44:52 Gram (chick pea flour) is better. Make chapatis with water and a spot of oil.  No oven required, just a pan.
1600 2018-07-22 19:44:51 "This outlook is anchored in higher oil prices and production, as well as stronger agricultural performance. Oil prices rebounded to an average of $52 per barrel (Brent crude) in 2017 and are projected to reach $54 in 2018, up from $43 per barrel in 2016."

1602 2018-07-22 19:44:33 Who is of so much political value there to be promised oil well? Is Frank who has never won his booth? As a member of any party, Frank will not attract attention, that's y he joined a group
1603 2018-07-22 19:44:15 She has like 3 strands of hair and no curl pattern though. If baby oil slicks down her hair like eco styler, coconut oil & shea butter mixed will be too heavy. Especially on her scalp. She needs something light like jojoba oil or grapeseed oil tbh

1614 2018-07-22 19:42:04 The thing that I don't understand is why these people think separating from Canada would make it easier to get oil through the rest of Canada and not substantially harder.
1615 2018-07-22 19:42:02 Hey Al, pay your taxes then I’ll give a damn about you. Just an over paid snake oil salesmen that stirs lies and hate to remain relevant and get paid. Your only concern is your pockets.
1616 2018-07-22 19:41:54 Historically, the Iran deal will go down as a very good one and also historically, reneging on the deal will go down as being extremely stupid. Everything that Trump says or does seems to have an ulterior motive so, what was it? Raise oil prices for Russia? What was the reason?
1617 2018-07-22 19:41:45 Lol some people don’t care about the truth. They only care about what directly benefits them. They will sell you snake oil for $1000 & then get angry at people who call them out for being a scam artist.
1618 2018-07-22 19:41:33 To keep the value and for a proper check every two years, it’s worth letting Porsche see it. Do an annual oil change for peace of mind or anything else yourself if you like.

1648 2018-07-22 19:37:33 Truck it or send it by rail. Economically, pipelines are that safest way to transport oil. Not environmentally. None of the options are without problems, but far less spills occur by truck or rail and the spills are small, easier to contain.
1649 2018-07-22 19:37:05 More proof how the young are ill informed. Be an individual! Do research! Stop following liars!

1666 2018-07-22 19:34:34 No you can’t. Or at least, not accurately - you can obviously lie or delude yourself if you want...

(Hint: most oil is produced by OPEC. It’s a cartel of mostly state-owned oil companies, including those famous capitalists in Venezuela)

1696 2018-07-22 19:30:02 Yeah like Israel should absorb thousands of Syrians. They have a country but like every Arab country they are run by dictators & oil sheiks.
1697 2018-07-22 19:29:52 My favorite Market correlation is the SnP 500 to crude oil.     Mostly because people talk about it as if they are really correlated
1698 2018-07-22 19:29:38 Funny--didn't know this. Back in the 80s we were duped by lousy science into thinking butter was bad, so someone invented hydrogenated vegetable oil which we now know is nasty stuff. Those butter cookies on the right are made with real butter and are quite delicious.

Plastic, unless it's from Dr. George Washington Carver's soybean source, is made from non-regrowable, finite, dead-dino crude oil.

Just a thought.

1736 2018-07-22 19:23:07 Yup that's tight. Maybe a light oil spray. Looks pretty!
1737 2018-07-22 19:23:04 Expect this to only get worse if/when crude oil keeps rising as it does in the summer. Mangudya to his credit was honest when he said brace for more fuel price hikes, government needs to further reduce it’s levy on fuel but they likely won’t.
1738 2018-07-22 19:22:55 I think Felixtowe and Southampton for instance are primarily long distance containerised?

1749 2018-07-22 19:20:59 We pay 38.5c/l on petrol, which makes our fuel expensive. It used to be 45c before the reduction earlier in the year, but the issue is that commodities have risen world wide and crude oil is now above $65.

1808 2018-07-22 19:13:17 Sports and politics mix like oil and water.
1809 2018-07-22 19:13:13 Today Flaco signs up for a candle/oil making class .... Let’s see how this turns out #yerrrrrrrrrrrrrr
1810 2018-07-22 19:12:53 what’s a good place for a oil change
1811 2018-07-22 19:12:50 to think an oil spill could've prevented the Aquaman movie
1812 2018-07-22 19:12:43 Let's sell the strategic oil reserve to Rudy. We won't even miss it!
1813 2018-07-22 19:12:25 The tatcha camellia cleansing oil!!!
1814 2018-07-22 19:12:20 today i was putting on tanning oil and my girl looks at me and says “damn girl u lookin like a carmelized onion” and i think that’s the new cinnamon apple
1815 2018-07-22 19:11:44 "How did our oil get under their soil?"
1816 2018-07-22 19:11:32 We barely survived sugar that was contaminated with mercury, then came contaminated fertilizer, before we could even start contemplating the mystery, contaminated maize popped in, and now we have contaminated oil. I'm sorry to say but Kenya seems to be contaminated with scandals.
1817 2018-07-22 19:11:29 I hate to say it, but I think this kid's set for life. He'll parlay this fame into internships and scholarships, and then some media gig, maybe even on camera. I think it's all part of his motivation.
1818 2018-07-22 19:11:24 Try CBD oil, its non psychoactive and it makes me not want to drink, and I can put down a whole bottle if not more when I drink which was every day.
1819 2018-07-22 19:11:20 Boy I stay using Kais baby oil shit so smooth!
1820 2018-07-22 19:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza today will be: soggy crust with damp motor oil and mushroom.
1821 2018-07-22 19:11:03 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
1822 2018-07-22 19:10:57 Putting tea-tree oil on my brand new cold sore because I read it helps them go away. it works
1823 2018-07-22 19:10:56 She can certainly afford it, but I suspect a fundraising effort here rather than just buying them tickets.  
Her position has changed from advocating for a strong prosperous Russia and calling them an ally just a few years ago.

1826 2018-07-22 19:10:40 I accidentally ate something with coconut oil yesterday and today.

1830 2018-07-22 19:10:15 1). Steele dossier - facts 

Verified: Former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page met with representatives of Russian state-owned oil giant Rosneft.

Verified: The Kremlin targeted educated youth and swing state voters during its cyber attacks in the 2016 campaign.

1833 2018-07-22 19:09:55 Wow, that’s a lot of sweet potatoes for one person! Coincidentally, I’m serving those evil white potatoes roasted at my dinner party tonight. Will you forgive me, please? What if I told you they will be sprinkled with olive oil and rosemary? ?
1834 2018-07-22 19:09:53 Got a scrub, a mask and an oil - making it super soft and the mask has collagen in it to help firm it up for a bit when I cba squatting hahah

1836 2018-07-22 19:09:33 Plan:
Turkey baste the oil off the top
Drain reservoir by unplugging it
Using radiator flush
Refill with antifreeze
1837 2018-07-22 19:08:49 Oil money! Trump playing with oil money?

Ok.
1838 2018-07-22 19:08:38 If only you realized that Venezuelan businesses are 70% privately owned, shortages aste caused by wealthy hoarders and suffering is because of US sanctions and artificial fixing of oil prices to damage their biggest export
1839 2018-07-22 19:08:24 PM sir I deeply appreciate your steps towards doubling farmer income and it will yield definite result in future. But sir my humble query why you have impose  restriction on export of only mustard oil. Please remove it as of other edible oils. It will help farmers and msme also
1840 2018-07-22 19:08:18 The Vietnamese have a method of roasting beans in a butter oil. It’s worth a trip to Vietnam.
1841 2018-07-22 19:08:13 Sis if u have timing and d snake oil meen mind 
1842 2018-07-22 19:08:09 Created a DIY growth oil today!
1843 2018-07-22 19:08:00 Baby wipes, baby oil or olive oil iirc
1844 2018-07-22 19:07:49 I used it too when I was around 16 and it worked!!!! Try also aloe Vera gel rose water and almond oil. I use them regularly and I have a healthy and good skin
1845 2018-07-22 19:07:39 The fisa calls out Page long relationship with russian Rosneft oil president Sechin. Page was in Moscow on Dec. 7, 2016. That was the day Putin sold a bunch of oil to Qatar and pocketed $5 billion. The deal couldn't go through unless usa waived Obama sanctions.
1846 2018-07-22 19:07:31 Holy cow. Oil rigs?

One time  while in jail, my celly was a Jamaican, a underwater welder, working/repairing on cargo ships in the Caribbean, his welding stories are epic. 

You've come along way from being a plumber. Congrats.
1847 2018-07-22 19:07:31 That's what they do for palm oil trees to.
1848 2018-07-22 19:07:24 Took my car in for a free oil change and now I’m having to buy 4 new tires because life is a neverending slog through the fiery pits of hell
1849 2018-07-22 19:07:18 I wanted a foreign car so bad now I’m paying $80 for oil change Sheeeesh
1850 2018-07-22 19:07:14 I have no problems with having my tac dollars spent on libraries.  I have a huge problem with them being paid to oil companies that record record profits as subsidies.
1851 2018-07-22 19:07:06 More oil! 
1852 2018-07-22 19:07:00 Has there been any Arab country that flourished without oil? Are there any Arab democracies? Do arabs allow Jews to live in their countries? How much land did the arabs steal from the Jews?
1853 2018-07-22 19:06:56 They are also stopping enforcement of the International Migratory Bird Act, which has successfully reduced deaths among those birds in waste water ponds at oil companies. Fines were used for maintenance of national parks and trails. There is no evil they won't sink to.
1854 2018-07-22 19:06:53 My midwife told me that coconut oil that you cook with can get rid of thrush, I hope there's a complaint against this doctor. X
1855 2018-07-22 19:06:46 Do you know what palm oil is?
1856 2018-07-22 19:06:36 Also, you know that thing called "democracy" that The United States of America likes to export to the rest of the world in exchange for oil? Yup! You guessed it! Boston Legal Sn 4 Ep 13 talks about it! Gotta love freedom of speech.
1857 2018-07-22 19:06:32 Still NO, for me.

I would donate to a nonprofit org. that is *actively* developing, or supporting dev't of, tech for planetary defense projects. But selling the effort as "asteroid insurance" strikes me as it being a "snake oil salesman" pitch.
1858 2018-07-22 19:06:27 New Rusiian order already happened with the last admin. Russia reset!Obama & Clinton handed Russia control in the middle east,our uranium and the oil pathway into Europe wqs given to Russia under Obama. Where was the outrage/news stories?Think Russia had something on them?
1859 2018-07-22 19:06:21 PM sir I deeply appreciate your steps towards doubling farmer income and it will yield definite result in future. But sir my humble query why you have impose  restriction on export only on mustard oil. Please remove it as of other edible oils. It will help farmers and msme also.
1860 2018-07-22 19:06:07 Would bake and then combine when all ingredients ready and use olive oil s&p, a little lemon juice/zest for seasoning
1861 2018-07-22 19:06:05 Simply having the oil means nothing when you don’t have the infrastructure to refine it, for example. And that has been the problem across Africa for decades. Lack of capital to develop a domestic economy.
1862 2018-07-22 19:05:52 But Israel needs it's own oil and gas resources after turkey falling out with them , so golan heights is stolen with resources needed , 
1863 2018-07-22 19:05:47 The King of Kings and Lord of Lords pours fresh golden love oil on every head in every nation everyday. That’s what make him Emperor of everyone.
1864 2018-07-22 19:05:43 No offense 2 ur company & bosses...but they r all a conflict of interest when
they r corporations 4 profit
U r paid by big Pharma, big Oil, big Food...and those r ur big accounts
So u can't show any in-depth reporting on these industries
It's sad & it's really a smokescreen
1865 2018-07-22 19:05:33 well cbd oil works
1866 2018-07-22 19:05:29 If you want to see what snake oil looks like, read the vert.x website though. It's like talking to a used car salesman.
1867 2018-07-22 19:05:23 Late Shri Balasaheb earned his bread and butter for him n family on the strength of PEN PENCIL & Hard Working boiling oil till midnight..He remainwd honest throughout his carrier...Next generation forgot him n his teaching..
1868 2018-07-22 19:05:22 You’ll get to ‘22 easily, I believe. 
We’ll trade you oil for water!
1869 2018-07-22 19:05:21 If you have vinegar, mix it with water and some amount of oil and spray it on the floor and see the magic.
1870 2018-07-22 19:05:19 Faith is the culmiation of hope. Hoping for salvation will leave you knocking on the bridegrooms door, tardy for the wedding feast. We want an extra supply of oil for our lamps. Or extra batteries for our flashlights.
1871 2018-07-22 19:04:26 MCT oil is very beneficial for type1 diabetics the ketones produced protects them if they have a Hypoglycaemic episode
1872 2018-07-22 19:04:12 2 back of the wild card entering today. Lose today and then lose the Cubs series and things could get ugly fast. Hazen should've added a bullpen piece coming out of the break. These last two games were more than winnable but the bullpen is leaking oil badly right now
1873 2018-07-22 19:04:09 Vitamin E oil  Magical.
1874 2018-07-22 19:04:05 Most especially Athiefku & Obj. That oil well, TSA they pepper them! Buhari will hand over to youth President not old looters that destroyed our nation
1875 2018-07-22 19:04:05 Cut them in halves, rub up some salt, pepper, your oil of choice, and some garlic powder on them, and roast them. That's the only way I've come to eat them.
1876 2018-07-22 19:04:00 I think he was specifically targetting the bulletproof coffee people which usually includes both.  The poor quality of modern day soil (and its ingestion by livestock/plants) probably contributes more to nutrient deficiencies than a tablespoon or 2 of MCT oil a day.
1877 2018-07-22 19:03:53 Holy shit. Number 3 looks like a damn oil painting! 
1878 2018-07-22 19:03:50 I don’t think I’ve ever paid full price for an oil change. There’s always a big coupon search before
1879 2018-07-22 19:03:34 BWHAHAHAHA - the POTUS that imposed the worst and most harshest sanctions on Russia since the end of the cold war, and even tried to undermine Russian oil sales to Europe, is a "Russian Asset?" BWHAHAHAHA -Do Dems expect sane people to believe such obvious cons and fraud?
1880 2018-07-22 19:03:33 1. Coconut oil can be a replacement as gloss and can have benefits

2.apply vasaline or carmex underneath your lip gloss to give it a plumped up look

3.add some eyeshadow to your gloss to add color to your lips
1881 2018-07-22 19:03:21 Ya'll are all rockstars I'm going through responses now...I went and bought turkey baster, funnels, radiator flush, and an oil pan....gonna figure this out before I touch it.
1882 2018-07-22 19:03:19 PM sir I deeply appreciate your steps towards doubling farmer income and it will yield definite result in future. But sir my humble query why you have impose  restriction on export only on mustard oil. Please remove it as of other edible oils. It will help farmers and msme also.
1883 2018-07-22 19:03:02 When The USA came to Middle East they said they were going to bring the democracy to it but they brought the territorism to it and stole the oil and all of our resources.. Saddam Hussain was the first  defender against that.
1884 2018-07-22 19:03:02 I like a little oil and a teaspoon of sugar. Better crust in my opinion, but I guess that's a matter of personal taste. What's more important is the level of hydration, mixing, and how you let it rise.
1885 2018-07-22 19:03:00 Lol. This is great. Thank you. 
So it has many uses, like tea tree oil does.

Thank you.
1886 2018-07-22 19:02:44 Marina, despite your sub-par effort in colorizing this *OIL ON CANVAS*, please keep working at your craft. With a little more practice, I'm sure you can get those garish hues under control! 
1887 2018-07-22 19:02:41 Could you ease yourself into drinking coffee? My friend drinks bulletproof coffee, which has butter AND coconut oil in it.
1888 2018-07-22 19:02:35 Opaque would be the team and yea prob 3 in 1 oil!!!
1889 2018-07-22 19:02:32 I have to agree with you on this "Oil Tot" but then again I always knew you were intelligent. My time on Facebook has overtime decreased dramatically in favor of #Twitter because the social media as a whole is more useful then Facebook not to mention I don't have much hate here
1890 2018-07-22 19:02:26 You're eating the wrong stotties - it's not a bread roll.  Soft crust, holey open texture (cos I think it's only proved once rather than twice) and flat on both top and bottom.  Like a soft crusted ciabatta without the olive oil added to the dough.
1891 2018-07-22 19:02:19 Estaba viendo un tutorial de maquillaje jajajajajajjajaja y la mina dice 'ahora me voy a poner "Unicorn Oil" (que es supuestamente aceite de unicornio jeje)' no existen los unicornios Jaquelineeeeee jsjsjajsjjsjsjajaja ay jajajajjwjajajjaj osijeno jajajajajajja
1892 2018-07-22 19:02:12 That’s Alberta, my in-laws are in Calgary & ex husband in McMurray (thank god). The province is all about oil, every business, family, all of their livelihoods are dependant on Oil.
Someday it will change, but not in my lifetime. #Trudeau doesn’t like Kinder Morgan....but stuck!

1896 2018-07-22 19:01:21 Ok. Here’s a thing. What happens to oil imports if there’s #NoDealBrexit? Serious question.
1897 2018-07-22 19:01:15 Roasted chickpeas rolled in a bit of oil, salt and if it’s not to pretentious balsamic vinegar delicious!!
1898 2018-07-22 19:01:12 I don’t use oil
1899 2018-07-22 19:01:07 You really want to go there?

Does the government really need to subsidize -

Big Ag 
Big Oil 
Ethanol
Religion (not a subsidy per se but what about lost revenue because of unnecessary tax exempt status)

and you want to go after libraries?!
1900 2018-07-22 19:00:59 Vaseline contains also contains harmful Mineral Oil, Parrafins, and microcrystalline waxes.
1901 2018-07-22 19:00:54 I was a plumber for about 10 years. Then I got into more industrial systems. And then I re trained as a welder. So now I fit and weld huge industrial pipes and do maintenance on oil rigs and in hydroelectric power stations. Good fun!
1902 2018-07-22 19:00:46 CBD oil might help.

1911 2018-07-22 19:00:11 It only takes about 30-40 minutes in the oven. Rub bird all over with olive oil or butter (not margarine), salt and pepper, slice a lemon in half, put it in the cavity with a sprig of rosemary. Delicious and easy!
1912 2018-07-22 19:00:04 Yeah, later in the evening, Shane and I will use it to vape flower, but those oil pen cartridges work for it.
1913 2018-07-22 18:59:48 R-APC has just come out to say Buhari is promising their leaders oil wells, automatic tickets etc.

History for them started on the day they were born.
1918 2018-07-22 18:58:57 Ordered with postmates and they gave me ranch instead of sub sauce.
For reference, sub sauce is oil, vinegar, and spices. 
Lmao wot
1919 2018-07-22 18:58:49 The West freed the inhabitants of many countries from dictators and control over oil fields, they got freedom and democracy, and oil tycoons their share of the pie.
1920 2018-07-22 18:58:48 It would probably be better to stockpile the ingredients for hummus. Chickpeas, tahini, olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper.
1921 2018-07-22 18:58:44 "Canada is responsible for just 1.5% of worldwide GHG, including the oilsands. Even if we shut in all our oil, other countries would pick up our market share, meaning we can impoverish ourselves, but the same amount of oil will still be burned." -Gunter

But, Butts will have won.

No Putin to WH -Spineless GOP -Wake up!
1924 2018-07-22 18:58:33 Nikki - we want concrete action, we all know the impotence of the U.N.  Arm the Iranian dissidents, cut off Iran's oil with a naval embargo. Bring the blood & mayhem to their backyard so they don't have resources to do it in others.  Enough talk !
1925 2018-07-22 18:58:14 Bro aweak ooo... after 3 seasons then en oil all finish

1927 2018-07-22 18:57:33 All that matters is your reaction in your hearts and minds to the King’s oil. Are your lamps full?

1933 2018-07-22 18:56:31 that looks like a super wet dough. Are you making something special?
I've found a bit of oil rubbed in to my hands can help with stickier kneads.

1940 2018-07-22 18:55:13 If we don’t protect our forests we will end up becoming a desert like Qatar but with no oil or a desert like Namibia but with no diamonds! This Mau forest stand-off is just unfortunate. @SophiaWanuna @KTNKenya #CheckPoint
1941 2018-07-22 18:55:06 Claire is right. One calorie of sugar and one calorie of coconut oil don’t contain the same amount of calories. #Pioppi
1942 2018-07-22 18:54:51 How much oil? Not laughing ....
1943 2018-07-22 18:54:43 That’s putting it politely

1947 2018-07-22 18:53:48 Derek Fildebrandt is tapping into the Alberta Martyrdom Syndrome. Sadly, many are infected. They sneer at the rest of Canada when oil prices are high and then feel slighted - unrequited - when oil prices are low.
1948 2018-07-22 18:53:36 And hard to say that the past - NASDAQ crash, East West liquidity crisis, fall of the Berlin Wall, oil price shock etc - was a walk across an open field.
1949 2018-07-22 18:53:35 Popping corn: popped in oil+butter mixture, with garlic powder, salt, black pepper. Serve hot with a film :-)
1950 2018-07-22 18:53:26 What President Trump is doing to let our American oil production loose will help keep the cost of gas down AND help us be the Sovereign Nation that we are meant to be.
I love my President!!!
1951 2018-07-22 18:53:25 When people ask me why my #Tesla Model 3 doesn’t need an oil change... #Magic
1952 2018-07-22 18:53:16 Peppermint oil also works wonders with migraines and headaches too!
1953 2018-07-22 18:52:53 not to defend el*n m*sk but tesla isn’t trying to be toyota it’s trying to be the Standard Oil monopoly for electric cars

Scared of drug testing?

Hit me up if you want any hemp oil that is 94% more absorbent than others, 0.0% THC, and is completely LEGAL

My DMs are not the black market.
I promise.
1956 2018-07-22 18:52:34 just you drink tis here oil of the snake
1957 2018-07-22 18:52:30 The highest level of stomach infrastructure. However if rAPC wants to sacrifice the security & prosperity of Nigeria on oil wells, they should go ahead.
1958 2018-07-22 18:52:05 Now that’s simple. Could use that for engine oil on genset
1959 2018-07-22 18:52:02 Thank you for sharing your #FakeNews enemy propaganda with us. I guess I better go get an oil change, if I'm a bot. It's been awhile. #WalkAway is an authentic, American movement & there are hundreds of videos on YouTube. It's amazing to watch, Colleen.
1960 2018-07-22 18:51:59 On same note, complexity of pt 30 days post allo #BMT is not same as the same patient 2 yrs later; issue here is how to account for time spent/complexity. Bad example - but anyways - same labor cost for oil change vs. overhauling your car's engine? 
1961 2018-07-22 18:51:58 each year they put more and more oil on their players
1962 2018-07-22 18:51:48 I mind when Dixon at dens tapped the ball 2 yards infront of him and chased it like he was towing an oil rig...absolute horror show!
1963 2018-07-22 18:51:47 Enough studying for the night i guess...... \\\ y am i always burning the midnight oil////
1964 2018-07-22 18:51:39 Nigeria is at an advantage because Nigeria has had heavy oil extracting infrastructure for decades, so without much sweat equity, they can get a nice cut of Chinese drilling in Nigeria.
1965 2018-07-22 18:51:28 Both of y’all bitches go EAT one. And George go change sum oil
1966 2018-07-22 18:51:22 Agreed,  if we just shut the taps off our country would starve & die.   But global demand for coal & oil is increasing as developing nations are building coal powered plants & buying more vehicles.  Fossil fuels will still be around for a long time.
1967 2018-07-22 18:51:19 before de men did lil better but now oil does be on de thing like vergie gravy
1968 2018-07-22 18:51:17 Oh no! The horror! Should we ban coconut oil too?! Seriously though, in Colorado this is already a normal thing.
1969 2018-07-22 18:51:12 業界よくしていきたいなーと思ってソボソボ動いてる人間だけど、一応こういう本とかも読んで勉強したりしてます

1970 2018-07-22 18:51:02 Putin helps Trump get elected. In return Trump lifts sanctions. Putin can proceed with The Big Oil deal.Trump gets to be President, gets a cut of The Big Oil deal AND gets to build in RU after office. What a sweet deal for them. It is all about the money. We suffer for it though.
1971 2018-07-22 18:50:56 And there was me thinking you were talking about some stroker microcar.  

It would've been more reliable if you actually fuelled it more frequently, petrol breaks down very quickly and 2t oil mix is even worse
1972 2018-07-22 18:50:54 So @frankiemuniz lives in Scottsdale and sells olive oil now.
1973 2018-07-22 18:50:47 Made new bottles of Hair Growth Oil & Scalp Cleanser 
1974 2018-07-22 18:50:41 I’ve reached the point in summer where I am using hairspray as tanning oil because I am not playing around now.
1975 2018-07-22 18:50:40 sometimes yes but sometimes no.  in the times of standard oil, there was no regulation on them.  then comes price fixing.  what separates is from the anarchists is having just barely enough government to protect competition, no?
1976 2018-07-22 18:50:35 Is these old people we have in power.
They're backward politics is indeed hindering our development.
"We" the young people have to change this. Especially in this sector.
And I would be happy to do intensive (& extensive) study on oil and natural gas and how we can benefit.
1977 2018-07-22 18:50:35 Ya dade bai gudu ba kuwa
1978 2018-07-22 18:50:28 Started using tea tree oil for acne. Smells horrible! Let’s see whether it works well for me or not.
1979 2018-07-22 18:50:24 HR a wee bit of advice don’t listen to the British media or the BBC as its twisted the facts. Scottish oil keeps and has kept the UK afloat. England needs electricity, fuel and food, it does not have enough. It gets 40% of its gas from Scotland, petrol, aviation fuel etc.
1980 2018-07-22 18:50:18 Most Germans were shitleans from Hitler's butt , why y'all gotta disrespect Mesut Oil like that yo?

1983 2018-07-22 18:49:56 Like chastising Hermany for buying oil from Russia or denuclearizing N Korea.  Making NATO stronger by encouraging them to spend on defense.
1984 2018-07-22 18:49:45 He can't read, it said "Oil on canvas" in your description of the painting. Is the world really that bad?
1985 2018-07-22 18:49:30 Hey Saskatchewan, you still love oil?
1986 2018-07-22 18:49:29 MPL hair oil babe.
1987 2018-07-22 18:49:19 While going to school I worked part time at an oil company and then waited tables at Pappadeaux's 5-6 days a week.
1988 2018-07-22 18:49:12 Does that include the 2014 white paper launched by @thesnp that promised me and others like me that Scotland could afford the promises without the oil? @AndrewWilson then gave the game away and admitted the promises were based on oil money. Still waiting on my apology.
1989 2018-07-22 18:49:10 ああオイル、どうして君はオイルなんだ…
1990 2018-07-22 18:49:02 “We can see oil field burning from where we are. During the day the unit beside us shot artillery toward the border. During the night it’s pretty quiet but we usually hear the shock waves from the bomb’s hitting the ground from the B-52”- The Camel in Saudi
1991 2018-07-22 18:48:58 I use most of my coconut oil for skin or scalp.
1992 2018-07-22 18:48:55 Don't blame the governors much, the so called Abuja, if not proceed from crude oil, they ll owe salaries too cause no  manufacturing sector. Failed govt
1993 2018-07-22 18:48:48 Nah...looks more like Lucas Oil Stadium in Indy.
1994 2018-07-22 18:48:37 So do you use rosehip oil directly on your skin? Is it good?
1995 2018-07-22 18:48:28 Did they? And why was obama on his knees to them? Why did he prevent the U.S. from drilling new wells while increasing our dependence on Saudi oil?
1996 2018-07-22 18:48:18 Was 7 Benghazi hearings worth our tax $? Or Trumps weekly golf outings? Or his son's business trips? Or the tax cuts for the wealthy? Or the farm & oil subsidies? Or an even larger military than the largest already in the world?
1997 2018-07-22 18:48:16 high priced oil predictions in today’s world are not prudent. don’t waste your money with those who hope, pray and finger cross. #oott
1998 2018-07-22 18:48:10 Love this oil... start my day with the protein shake then water the rest of the day with the slim n sassy!
1999 2018-07-22 18:47:41 my dad said “you need a 5w-30 oil & a filter. and your engine is a V6 if they ask.” LMAO I THINK I KNOW THIS. DAD.
2000 2018-07-22 18:47:37 I'm fine with letting the Iranian people what happens inside their borders. Meanwhile, I can watch the Revolutionary Guards get blasted on battle fields across the Middle East while even Russia & China decide to buy their oil elsewhere.
2001 2018-07-22 18:47:22 Finally did the oil change on the Z
2002 2018-07-22 18:47:11  Nurp oil changed , rims removal 
2003 2018-07-22 18:47:00 They will do what they did to the Irish if we let them.
They better respect the Scottish people and just accept it and get on,
But they wont,they will see indy as a treachery and make enemies of scots to keep oil and gas.
We cant let that happen

2015 2018-07-22 18:45:10 Start out with the wash and oil set. The wash stimulates the follicles and the oil nourishes to help with growth.
2016 2018-07-22 18:44:41 last night i was receiving a calf massage from one friend while another friend gave me a shoulder rub, Joan Armitrading was playing, and we were diffusing eucalyptus oil. I’ve never felt more like I was starring in the beginning of a lesbian porno
2017 2018-07-22 18:44:21 I personally have not seen or heard educated debates on saving Guyana from Dutch disease; mainly because we don’t see it as a current threat. We’ve been talking a lot about oil but not specifically negative economic consequences
2018 2018-07-22 18:44:21 I always put too much peppermint oil on my hot oil hair treatment. Literally my eye wont stop watering 
2019 2018-07-22 18:44:19 It’s astounding to me that Arizona isn’t investing more into solar energy. If we were sitting on large oil fields, we’d be drilling that shit out ASAP.
2020 2018-07-22 18:44:18 The big lad in clover? Or an extra virgin Italian oil at least!

2023 2018-07-22 18:44:05 The alternative is ti ingest cannabis oil, it will cure any disease and it's not addictive
2024 2018-07-22 18:44:02 The price of oil plummeted everywhere... why didn’t Saskatchewan experience as much divestment? Or the US? You either have no clue what your talking about or you live in a sheltered bubble and can’t see what’s happening outside Alberta.

2028 2018-07-22 18:43:40 Did YOU know the waters you look out on from Carnoustie are "English waters", as UKGov altered the English border in 1999 to seize Scots oil wells?
2029 2018-07-22 18:43:31 He got NATO to agree to $40 billion more now and more in the future. Asked Germany to get their oil from us instead of Russia.

Why arn't you interested in finding out if Hillary got $400 million from a Russian for her campaign. We want to know if that is true or not.
2030 2018-07-22 18:43:26 Check out our Soak and Float shampoo bar! It's made with cade oil, which is derived from juniper and has long been used to treat psoriasis, dandruff, and eczema. Rose and marigold petals also help calm things down and soothe redness. 
2031 2018-07-22 18:42:58 Venezulia has largest dirty oil reserves in world, but it's wealth only worked with $150/barrel oil. With wealth it stop being productive capitalisum country & supplied everything to people. When oil price fell, so did economy of Venuzulia & it's ability compete in world.
2032 2018-07-22 18:42:49 ..And it worked. Also killing the The Magnitsky Act signed by Obama was another top priority for the Russians. It's also most likely why Rex Tillerson, someone with tons Russian oil industry experience and no diplomat 
experience was chosen to be the Sec. of State
2033 2018-07-22 18:42:42 Breaking news: Politicians meet publicly to discuss policy beneficial to both (buying oil from RU to reduce our dangerous dependence on OPEC, who were manipulating mkt price, bc they could)

Trump groveling to Putin as intel confirms beyond a doubt that he attacked our election
2034 2018-07-22 18:42:24 Goes out and buys more beard oil.
2035 2018-07-22 18:42:21 Pretty simple. Russia was desperate to have sanctions lifted for a HUGE oil deal by Rosneft, the biggest Russian oil company. That wasn't gonna happen with Hillary. So they used people like Bud McFarlane,Carter,Manafort,etc with Russian oil lobbying experience to reach the GOP..

Also, unless we have cold Spring demand is decreasing in April /2

2064 2018-07-22 18:39:23 That drop in oil prices had nothing to do with the US flooding the market with cheap oil right? It’s not like they have a history of undermining socialist economies by taking a loss on their own resources. It’s a win win, work with the Saudis and choke out Venezuela and Iran.
2065 2018-07-22 18:39:19 You're not cooking in the coconut oil. You're just using coconut oil as an extra layer of fat in the pan to prevent it from sticking. You don't need much coconut oil for that (maybe 1/4 teaspoon, if even that, for a medium size pan). Compare that w/2 tablespoons of butter.
2066 2018-07-22 18:39:02 My little girl calls pizza peeppa... I dont know what she will to ibiza. You wonder what im thinking.. Theres a correlation.. Like oil goes up, dollar is down, pound =down gold= down..

2076 2018-07-22 18:37:38 My mom sent me an article last year that some plastics have fish oil in it or something so that could be another reason why he likes it?
2077 2018-07-22 18:37:35 I prefer to wait, it looks Oil will go down big.
2078 2018-07-22 18:37:25 While US continues to threaten countries with CAATSA on trading with Russia & Iran,keeps criticising China & Russia for leakages in sanctions, China extends oil life to North Korea. _medium=tw_repost #oilprice
2079 2018-07-22 18:37:22 Very real concerns about such things, Assad is just 1 of the guilty parties. We (via our own Gov in the national interest) are no less guilty. Oil, Death & Profit go hand in hand the Middle East. The destruction suits our purpose so we fan the flames & join in with the slaughter
2080 2018-07-22 18:37:19 Jamaican Black castor oil
2081 2018-07-22 18:37:16 I am assuming that refineries have several weeks of supplies already piped in or at anchor offshore. Will have also have been future traded. Still a lot of oil from North Sea as well.

2082 2018-07-22 18:36:42 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!
2083 2018-07-22 18:36:39 Once I had to take the handle off my bathroom door to oil up the springs, cause they kept creaking. Having done that, I grabbed a can of WD40, walked in, and shut the door behind me with the handle still outside. Felt awkward explaining that to the locksmith...
2084 2018-07-22 18:36:13 Who else once had white rice with cooking oil for supper?
2085 2018-07-22 18:35:55 Any oil in the cooling system is a bad thing.
2086 2018-07-22 18:35:46 Of course, only if you oil mines as well . 
2087 2018-07-22 18:35:38 Gas and oil changes are the most inconvenient expense.
2088 2018-07-22 18:34:22 No. You need to get an oil change. 
2089 2018-07-22 18:34:01 So, my vocal cords are a little strained. I looked up how to heal my voice faster and this is what I got...

Ginger root
2 tsps. of honey
Eucalyptus oil

Tf is ginger root and eucalyptus oil?
2090 2018-07-22 18:34:00 I should have invested in Veyron oil.
2091 2018-07-22 18:33:57 The survival of both is intrinsically  dependent on Russia and its oligarchs and US and it's energy barons to  expand production of oil, natgas. And flaunt accepted global climate goals.This involves destabilizing the western alliance.
2092 2018-07-22 18:33:54 Many years ago I climbed to the top of Signal Hill in Long Beach, wasn't much up there, aside from a few oil wells.
2093 2018-07-22 18:33:51 Events re baits. Trading oil is so much more than fun
2094 2018-07-22 18:33:42 Everyone needed the rationed Kerosene Oil because there was no power in villages, and rarely so in cities. There was a massive black market for Kerosene, FFS.

2095 2018-07-22 18:33:41 It’s 2018, can they make a car that doesn’t require regular maintenance? I’m sick of paying for gas, oil changes, tires, etc. the fuck
2096 2018-07-22 18:33:40 Ive been taking the cbd oil but don’t really feel any change/difference. Maybe up my frequency?
2097 2018-07-22 18:33:36 Packets of crisps with no salt bags.  Oil of Olay (Ulay).
2098 2018-07-22 18:33:36 My brother, corruption is when a man  gives birth to 10 children and all he does is to sell Suya at Mararaba junction. We condone this babaric behavior now See wht boko haram is costing us today, can u quantify lives with any amount of money? Oil money that we did no work 4
2099 2018-07-22 18:33:34 KAI always cooks really spicy curry with a lot of chili oil to it... It BURNS!;;
2100 2018-07-22 18:33:25 Granted.
But there are no facts about Guyana. He wrote an article from "comments" made by other people.
And again, he failed to identify how the oil will negatively impact Guyana, and he did not suggest any possible solution, or how we can prevent the Dutch Disease.

So BULLSHIT!
2101 2018-07-22 18:33:01 Coal, oil, WVU, Charleston, Jerry West, Morgantown, Mountain Mama, Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River, and Country Roads, John Denver
2102 2018-07-22 18:32:50 I would have sent it back, he asked for some olive oil and put up with it.
2103 2018-07-22 18:32:48 I am old enough to remember the Socialist Paradise I grew up in during my formative years. Kerosene Oil was a rationed commodity - my folks would get up really early and stand in line to get some.

2104 2018-07-22 18:32:40 U need keep promise and legalise maryjane for pain and kids with siezures oil work on so dnt siezure.from research but ya bk it buddy!!!
2105 2018-07-22 18:32:39 No different than the tobacco companies knowing cigarettes cause cancer but not disclosing it until they were forced to. Big oil is no different.
2106 2018-07-22 18:31:54 Olive oil and liqueur
2107 2018-07-22 18:31:47 Almond milk is gr8 but it takes a lot of water to produce (as do all milk alts) and most of the world’s almonds are grown in California and we have no water lol plus shipping it everywhere takes oil so if you can try to find locally produced milk alts!
2108 2018-07-22 18:31:44 Meditation and lavender oil help me before bed 
2109 2018-07-22 18:31:14 Man or woman. If you cant change a tire and/or the oil, you shouldnt be driving. You shouldnt even get a license without knowing how to change a tire. Should be part of the test!
2110 2018-07-22 18:31:13 I used to live in Malden, life in MA is expensive glad I moved before heating oil prices went up, that alone would have sunk us.
2111 2018-07-22 18:31:00 Avocado oil too I think works good as well!
2112 2018-07-22 18:30:55 Obama’s executive orders 
sanctions on:
-individuals  responsible for violating the Ukraine
-Russian defense companies &individuals in Putin’s inner circle 
-six of Russian  banks, four energy companies
Obama  limited oil exploration near Russia.
TRUMP LIFTED THESE SANCTIONS
2113 2018-07-22 18:30:43 How are you going to say you know more about cars than me but you don’t even know what kind of oil your car takes?
2114 2018-07-22 18:30:33 This recipe called for eggs, coconut oil and baking powder. Maybe it needs heavy cream.  oh and I baked 350.

2117 2018-07-22 18:30:16 I miss when my dad would take my car to get an oil change.... being an adult is hard 
2118 2018-07-22 18:30:13 Busted out the waffle maker for the first time in ages today. Subbed sauce for oil and almond milk for cow's milk. Added lots of cinnamon. Theo approved 
2119 2018-07-22 18:30:09 Freddy King - Just Pickin' - Texas Oil
2120 2018-07-22 18:30:04 Yeah see you got real white folks hair. You can’t use a lot. Just a little right after shampooing. Especially if you’re going to use other products that most likely have coconut oil in it.
2121 2018-07-22 18:30:00 Mix flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt in a microwave-safe mug; stir in milk, canola oil, water, and vanilla extract.
Cook in microwave until cake is done in the middle, about 1 minute 45 seconds.
2122 2018-07-22 18:29:59 You have absolutely no inclination to take on board what officers are saying!! Your puppet masters have been destroying policing for years!! Keep your platitudes to yourself!! Snake oil salesman!!
2123 2018-07-22 18:29:45 Modern day slavery by an oil rich country. At which point does money corrupt you so much  that you lose your soul?
2124 2018-07-22 18:29:40 Beard oil, styling balm, and maybe try out some other @beardbrand products like the sea salt spray and mustache wax for the beard and hair. You will love the way it gives you control without being overly heavy in your beard.
2125 2018-07-22 18:29:34 What if you have a drought and an oil glut in the same year? It's only smart to diversify your economy
2126 2018-07-22 18:29:14 Onions, fresh pepper, palm oil, otazi leaf, native spice....

2128 2018-07-22 18:28:53 Sure. A major recession in 2021 instead of the GS outlook. Anyone can make stuff up. Goldman does not have a very good record in this. Still waiting for $200/barrel oil!!
2129 2018-07-22 18:28:43 I got it from the a local beauty supply .But you can get online search queen helene coconut oil 100%
2130 2018-07-22 18:28:37 Think that novel's done? Think again! Try drizzling a little truffle oil on the first page. Voila!
2131 2018-07-22 18:28:31 You must grow to a place where your mind stays open in love to all undeserving flesh so you can release fresh oil on them.
2132 2018-07-22 18:28:30 Big funders like WWF, CI, Sierra Club and influential green political parties are all pro wind energy. Funding research that could possibly halt the development is a devilish issue for them. Maybe whale's best friend will become funds from big oil, that would be ironical.
2133 2018-07-22 18:27:52 Nope. Not acceptable.  They need to be allowed to leave. Why are we being embarrassed with this begging and twisted story of oil bloc offer. This was AVOIDABLE!!!
2134 2018-07-22 18:27:46 @SarahJo04587544 from what I'm seeing you should not have any problems at all Sarah in Denton ,Texas. Unless of course you living in the middle of an oil field without a car.
2135 2018-07-22 18:27:44 I made my own chilli infused oil and it's so spicy I am now crying into my salad
2136 2018-07-22 18:27:37 The world has more clean energy in ocean salt water(mainly the water) than mankind will ever use up in 1 million years. Fuck crude oil cuz it's dirty and toxic!
2137 2018-07-22 18:26:52 @maddow Is it me or does it seem that every time republicans take office chaos ensues in the world and then democrats bay cleanup while the republicans donors quietly take in the money? Rumsfeld Cheney, Bush, the usual mobile oil Saudi and Russia connections?
2138 2018-07-22 18:26:46 Dept chair in grad school told a group of grad students (incl me) asking for formal training in our program, "If you need statistics, you aren't doing important science". When the dinosaurs won't get out of the way, run them over. They are now coal and oil.

2142 2018-07-22 18:26:01 Fresh pepper, palm oil, salt, onions
2143 2018-07-22 18:25:38 If he is going to attack Maggie, wouldn't mentioning the stolen sovereignty of some Scottish North Sea oil be better?
2144 2018-07-22 18:25:15 I start putting peppermint oil in my deep conditioners and bitch this shit feels amazing
2145 2018-07-22 18:24:55 Oil, gas, guns and Russian money.  What could go wrong?
2146 2018-07-22 18:24:54 There’s an art to perfectly poached eggs and then there’s the buttered or Olive Oil toast. Mm.
2147 2018-07-22 18:24:39 Cars clean, changed the oil now getting food successful Sunday
2148 2018-07-22 18:24:37 my dad is supposed to change my oil today so i can’t go anywhere far i’m really considering going to walgreens to pass some time
2149 2018-07-22 18:24:31 Make sure it doesn’t contain palm oil! Toxic for dogs
2150 2018-07-22 18:24:30 Its not the Glue its the oil on ur nails
2151 2018-07-22 18:24:23 Boil sliced garlic, lemon wedges with skin on and a bit of cayenne pepper. Sweeten if you want. Drink about 3 cups. I add a drop of ginger t-tree or peppermint oil and if i have a cough drop that has menthol. I also apply eucalyptus and other supportive oils under my feet.
2152 2018-07-22 18:24:05 まだ昼の3:00だぞ？1日が始まって半分しか経ってないぞ？
2153 2018-07-22 18:24:00 Weird, are you sure there isn't history or story behind that . . . . Like an Oil tanker going down in the area! Or it oil leak from a natural oil well nearby! I bet you stand on it, touch it and still you hardly believe it!
2154 2018-07-22 18:23:58 plZzzzzzzz stop buying palm oil products people!!!!!
2155 2018-07-22 18:23:49 I think cocoa butter and coconut oil smell different on black women

2164 2018-07-22 18:22:06 An oil tanker overturned on highway near Dhrangadhara on saturday, Oil spilled creating poor braking conditions, More than 40 accidents in last 24hr cz of negligence by Highway authorities @CMO_Gujarat @CMOGuj @GujaratTourism @MORTHIndia @MORTHRoadSafety @nitin_gadkari @PMOIndia

2166 2018-07-22 18:21:12 Decided not to wear makeup and stick to my grape seed oil , mascara and lip gloss
2167 2018-07-22 18:21:06 What evidence? That Carter Page went to Russia as a part of an oil conference and talked to Russians who worked for the Govt that owns the oil companies?

Hillary's campaign talked to Ukrainians so I demand a FISA warrant. Hillary even hired a former Ukrainian govt worker.
2168 2018-07-22 18:21:04 
2169 2018-07-22 18:20:59 Where did you put the oil? In the radiator, or the white plastic recovery tank? If it's in the recovery tank, you can remove the tank and empty it. If it's in the radiator, there should be a drain valve somewhere near the bottom.
2170 2018-07-22 18:20:41 yes that's rather a big badge he's wearing!
2171 2018-07-22 18:20:37 ill oil him up using my tongue hahah *kidding
2172 2018-07-22 18:20:37 BBC propaganda machine has started. Am making a fish pie, wondered will we see marketing on rape seed versus olive oil. Was testing my internet & checking the TV was working. A TV show "Inside the factory" is running a coffee show mentioning freeze dried a lot. Happy Brexit
2173 2018-07-22 18:20:29 We hate hearing your oil change took so long. Were you able to speak with a member of management? If not, please contact us at (800)-walmart (800-925-6278).
2174 2018-07-22 18:20:26 Not one shred of proof -DJT has blasted Germany for buying Russian oil -that's not exactly siding with Russia
2175 2018-07-22 18:20:21 イギリス人はジャガイモ人の顔面に投げつけて遊ぶのか………
2176 2018-07-22 18:20:18 This isn't a just tech thing alas. When I was doing oil field services investing a few years back I saw the exact same thing.
2177 2018-07-22 18:20:17 Before breakfast, Mitch McConnell accidentally convinces President Trump that Russian oil executives are spies. Glenn Beck endorses Trump.

2180 2018-07-22 18:19:56 Tried coconut oil. Nothing
2181 2018-07-22 18:19:55 if you have synthetic oil like my car does it lasts a long time, like it turned out I was getting oil changes too early for awhile
2182 2018-07-22 18:19:43 Don’t cheat keep waiting till she’s comfortable.  in the meantime you better invest in a sex doll and a lot of baby oil 
2183 2018-07-22 18:19:40 There are many high paying jobs in texas. Finance, medical, oil and gas, and engineering.  And lots of those jobs are going to California refugees.
2184 2018-07-22 18:19:34 If you think gearbox oil is lifetime you are a idiot
2185 2018-07-22 18:19:31 Someone: try this CBD oil

Me: cock and ball dorture?
2186 2018-07-22 18:19:26 Once a pore becomes clogged, it traps skin oil inside. Bacteria grows in this oil and can cause an inflammatory response in the skin.
2187 2018-07-22 18:19:16 Trump's game plan seems to be tariffs and sky high oil prices (his assault on Iran). China still has massive usd cash reserves though, and a lot of the debt is in renminbi, which allows for leeway in a communist economy, just look at how long Japan has managed it's debt pile
2188 2018-07-22 18:19:10 Coconut oil? Well, any oil really.
2189 2018-07-22 18:19:09 Thats sad   to here that happened well thats the job you could die driveing a car or running equipment or oil and gas you never know when but in saying that sad to be shot but what bothers me the most as canada opp should be rcmp trained not us ideas USA tactics in a canadian sys
2190 2018-07-22 18:19:06 You don't want oil going through your water pump and engine. Best to disconnect lower radiator hose and drain into a bucket. Keep away from animals as well. Good luck.

nothing else
2193 2018-07-22 18:18:42 Nope. Not acceptable.  They need to be allowed to leave. Why are we being embarrassed with this begging and twisted story of oil bloc offer. This was AVOIDABLE!!! RUBBISH
2194 2018-07-22 18:18:38 Brake job. 
Oil change 
Fix supper 
Tired 
2195 2018-07-22 18:18:37 There are a bunch that keep trotting out "Hydrogen is the future for electric vehicles" reports who are funded by oil companies who currently produce hydrogen as a messy byproduct of oil production...  They don't just appear on BBC but also do school/uni talks...
2196 2018-07-22 18:18:36 As long as the price of oil held up, yes. You would need to diversify your economy to get thru any oil gluts
2197 2018-07-22 18:18:31 WOOD OVEN ROASTED CHICKEN WINGS-V Pizza

Marinated with Fresh lemon, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Rosemary, Salt & Pepper, Fresh Garlic, and Caramelized onions.
2198 2018-07-22 18:18:22 I’m assuming you put the oil into the plastic over flow tank and not the radiator itself?
2199 2018-07-22 18:18:10 This Wild Growth oil is really something  new staple
2200 2018-07-22 18:18:06 Only thing I hate about the coconut oil is it makes my hair sooo oily
2201 2018-07-22 18:18:00 I think I'm gonna get some more jamaican black castor oil.
2202 2018-07-22 18:17:49 of course they can.  standard oil and us steel historically.  nowadays we're seeing telecom try to consolidate.  many niche markets have monopolies and it's highly anti competitive.
2203 2018-07-22 18:17:45 it depends on your face. I actually found it better to massage my face with oil at night and wash with soap/cleanser LESS
2204 2018-07-22 18:17:42 Someone invents motor oil chapstick and we kiss the robots. But only if the robots want to.
2205 2018-07-22 18:17:41 Hello I don't know the situation but pure CBD oil can replace insulin. You can get it a lot cheaper and more of it. Like I said I don't know the whole story but check it out
2206 2018-07-22 18:17:39 Running out of oil...
can't live off all that you have saved...

2209 2018-07-22 18:17:36 It is a must that i get a oil change and car wash & vacuum this week.

2211 2018-07-22 18:17:02 Maybelline, gak bikin kering dan hasilnya glossy. Kusuka. YSL yang tint oil juga bagus banget.
2212 2018-07-22 18:16:52 I lived there then. It was liberal but the shah's regime had brutal elements. It's complicated. Bottom line, imo, democracy flourishes in country's that tax their citizens. Oil rich nations don't tax so people don't demand as much.
2213 2018-07-22 18:16:46 If it was replaced by a restorative nation building process then sure, however that didn’t happen & the reality is that it’s mess with ongoing violence and chaos.  That’s what happens when you replace a dictator with no plan or care for the nation, except a goal to extract oil.
2214 2018-07-22 18:16:36 I restarted bot-only world because there was no oil that I don't do anything and feel bad about not doing anything
2215 2018-07-22 18:16:09 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, however illegal overstays.
2216 2018-07-22 18:16:06 Journalism isn’t important work though
2217 2018-07-22 18:15:58 I needa stop getting oil in my hair at work
2218 2018-07-22 18:15:42 Use sand paper and brillo pads, chilli oil mustard and a couple of tubes of deep heat, scrub hard and apply liberally. It won't cure your sun  burn, but the pain might remind you to use sun screen or stay indoors.

Global Cooling
Peak Oil
Global Warming

Boy, its sure hard to figure out why people might be skeptical of dire warnings by failed prophets.
2221 2018-07-22 18:15:28 Oil companies want it because it increases their hard costs, which in a world of time and material plus profit, that increases their profits.

2223 2018-07-22 18:15:15 Your sex has nothing to do with anythkng. Your brother and his snake oil selling chums have not only duped the electorate, but have gone on to take advantage of what this utter fiasco will to the rest of us less wealthy and secure than your mob.
2224 2018-07-22 18:15:06 Consumption methods of cannabis include: 
1. FLOWER - dried cannabis flowers inhaled as smoke or vapor
2. EXTRACTS - cannabis concentrates like hash oil, wax & shatter
3. TOPICALS - cannabis-infused creams, lotions & balms  
4. EDIBLES - any food or beverage infused with cannabis

2230 2018-07-22 18:14:27 Exactly!!!!!  PRE-EC ..... we managed very well then, esp with The commonwealth, which isn't talked about during these Brexit arguments!  Seems to me, it's really all about money, greed, ownership, controll, oil & gas, ownership, with much corruption, deals and back-handers ...
2231 2018-07-22 18:14:13 Trump is after the oil!!! That why Tillerson was picked by Russia
2232 2018-07-22 18:14:07 Sir,  I see this as antics to divert funds for 2019. In this eleventh hour, we will see more of misplaced priorities. Can this govt. report on how much have been spent exploring for oil in the North East?
2233 2018-07-22 18:14:05 I just started getting vertigo with migraines in the last few years. I don’t get them on every one but it sucky when it does happen. I found putting cotton in my ears helps a little and peppermint oil where it is sore helps!
2234 2018-07-22 18:14:03 I don't think it will do any immediate damage. But, the oil will not transfer heat from the engine efficiently like antifreeze does. Drain the contaminated antifreeze and refill. It'll be ok.
2235 2018-07-22 18:14:02 Let's see, tires= rubber, oil based product.  Handlebar grips =rubber/plastic, oil based product. Reflectors in wheels = plastic, oil based product. Helmet = foam and plastic, oil based product.  Sneaker soles = rubber, oil based product. Never mind the smelting for the frame.

2238 2018-07-22 18:13:45 Explain how Clinton hit 400 million from Russia or Podesta  received 100k shares of a Russian oil company   Massive pay for play.   How does Susan Rice  go in poor like Obama and bone out with net worth of 50 million ? The comrades are doing well and fascists
2239 2018-07-22 18:13:19 Coconut oil makes everything taste like coconut though.
2240 2018-07-22 18:13:10 My mom just made this zucchini noodle olive oil and butter sauce dish with shrimp and it’s so good I might cry
2241 2018-07-22 18:13:09 Did he send them pallets of cash?

How is telling Germany to limit its gas and oil purchases from Russia in Putin's interest? How are the sanctions in his interest?

Wait... somebody did say that we should pursue policies which benefit both countries... now, who was that again?
2242 2018-07-22 18:12:57 A self-congratulatory bunch. In unison "We are AWESOME!!! We taught you everything!!"
2243 2018-07-22 18:12:56 texas should outlaw any texas oil going to california! cut off their supply. that will cure climate change problem....................

Well done, Cheds Team
2251 2018-07-22 18:12:28 Turning to other issues, it is difficult to expect governments to do something real against climate change, there are many interests created around oil and maizean governments, this has to come from citizen groups, NGOs
2252 2018-07-22 18:12:27 ha. the far left has already won. you referred to "free college" and "medicare for all" as "talk about the economy". evidently, we have progressed beyond Clinton already. now we need to progress further. put big oil out of business to unleash our economic potential.
2253 2018-07-22 18:12:20 If we want sustainable national progress, appointment as GMD of NNPC should stop being political. The oil helmsman should be hired like any other company CEO. The post should be internationally advertised and competitively filled. #naijamattersarising
2254 2018-07-22 18:12:06 I forgot i still have free oil change with Nissan, I’ll leave after i get that done tomorrow
2255 2018-07-22 18:12:02 Put on some coconut oil!!!
2256 2018-07-22 18:11:59 You'll probably end up with a Mercedes-Benz...

...that will piss oil on your things.
2257 2018-07-22 18:11:57 True. Olive oil is often a surrogate for more soybean oil in people's diets regardless of what the label reads.
2258 2018-07-22 18:11:40 davines oi oil shampoo, conditioner, and hair oil!! I have frizzy hair and it even gives me silky waves, it’s the best!!

2262 2018-07-22 18:11:21 They shutdown coal,oil,natural gas,to cut down our carbon footprint which Canada already neutralizes many times with boreal forests and crops, then they add on a carbon tax just to make sure that Canada is a downward spiraling economy that no one is due about investing in
2263 2018-07-22 18:11:02 think most olive oil is cut with soy oil anyway....right?
2264 2018-07-22 18:10:58 - What do I do with giant mandibles? 
- Bin 'em.
- Tiger cage, barometers, oil portraits?
- Bin. Remember how she asked everyone to stay over? It's all their junk.
- Samovars? Tackle?
- Bin
- And this silver mirror?
- Oh this one we keep. That's how she'll get back.
2265 2018-07-22 18:10:56 The rest of the world understand?? Ohh yeah our dear European “allies” who only concern about this so called deal was to get cheap oil from Iran. Wake up blind sheep!!
2266 2018-07-22 18:10:47 God I remember when I bought that @NiallOfficial ticket! I only had $60 in my bank account and I needed to buy oil paint for class, but I spent $42.50 buying tickets for this boy.
As I look at it now, I don't regret it! I made an A in the class and Niall was a blast!
2267 2018-07-22 18:10:39 Dry clean with suede eraser and brush & if looking OK, dye if needed
If they're clack there are products like mink oil you can spray straight on which bring back the original colour without need for dyeing
I use fiebings or angelus suede dyes - basically all the same stuff
2268 2018-07-22 18:10:35 Great idea, will save some messing with old oil.

2272 2018-07-22 18:10:14 BTW all opinions are “biased”. People can probe/think/figure out which accord with facts. I’m a medical consumer signed up with many LPs and there’s lots of products available. @TweedMainStreet has 25 strains of flower and 17 oil/softgel available today. From CBD heavy to THC.
2273 2018-07-22 18:10:05 Got 2 orders gone this weekend but vintage machines are ∗not∗ designed to work in this heat. Poor old thing is starting to weap oil from some odd places. Full check up on all of them this week.
2274 2018-07-22 18:10:05 He also recommended drinking a cup of corn oil each day, which paved the way for Ancel Keys to shill the Mediterranean diet (with a patriotic American oil--corn or soybean--displacing the olive oil forever pictured in the center of the propaganda photos).

2276 2018-07-22 18:09:59 Okay so I only use coconut oil and I shampoo my hair with either Silicon hydrating shampoo, the conditioner, && sometimes I use some shea moisture shit

2280 2018-07-22 18:09:45 who got the oil?
2281 2018-07-22 18:09:27 Expecting most Canadian O&G companies with heavy oil and natgas exposure to struggle with earnings. Those with mostly light oil and liquids should see a strong quarter. A bit of Jekyll and Hyde for the Canadian O&G sector. #OOTT

2299 2018-07-22 18:06:19 Not a keto freak myself. But I've tried BP coffee and the important thing is to use unsalted butter. Alternately a tablespoon of coconut oil is good too and great flavor. The blender is important or the fat flavor dominates as the fat floating on top is the first thing you taste
2300 2018-07-22 18:06:11 The 1st and only thing you felt the need to defend was your position on Climate Change. Deniers are clearly the lowest of the low, or owned by corp interests. Every respectible scientist agrees, the only ones who dont are being paid by gas and oil corp's to find those conclusions
2301 2018-07-22 18:06:08 The government never should have broken up Standard Oil. They were providing cheap gas for everyone!
2302 2018-07-22 18:06:00 Not just him and his snake oil, his “church” is exempt. What??? The donations from those 30,000 congregants aren’t taxed either.

2331 2018-07-22 18:01:35 I use stainless steel and then layer it w/coconut oil when I use it. That doesn't include the fat I'm cooking in.

2343 2018-07-22 18:00:13 I have tried the brownies and I love those too! The eyescream are great as well. My sister has a bunch of beautybakerie and she loves it all. The face oil and the mascara and the lipwhips and all that. We have yet to try the concealer and foundation tho.
2344 2018-07-22 17:59:57 Been getting a lot of requests for info on CBD Oil and the Keto Energy drink.   Want to meet up and talk one on one!  I have a few with me of each!  More coming next week.
2345 2018-07-22 17:59:36 CALLING ALL CAR PEOPLES:

What happens if I accidentally put oil in where the antifreeze is supposed to go?
2346 2018-07-22 17:59:29 My face is probably the most confused. I apply oil during the day and non greasy at night. Like ??
2347 2018-07-22 17:59:20 Uh oh. They will have to do more to get investors. The government needs to provide some seed money. Nigeria is oil rich. 

It frustrates me to see Africa not reaching where it could be, especially with all those great natural resoures. It also upsets me to see people suffer.
2348 2018-07-22 17:59:17 If you have access to eucalyptus oil, try rubbing some on your temples and your forehead. I’ve used it before for migraines. It helps to open constricted blood vessels.
2349 2018-07-22 17:59:16 Currently doing an egg + conditioner + olive oil protein treatment... I hadn’t done one of these since maybe 2011

2352 2018-07-22 17:58:59 Lol I completely understand! I’ve limited my carb intake for sure and I’ve been making sure I have veggies, protein, and fat (ie olive oil to cook the chicken in) for each meal. In the morning I’ve been making smoothies (protein powder, frozen fruit, and almond milk)
2353 2018-07-22 17:58:58 Ran a mile, changed the oil on the truck and went by to wash moms car. Now time for some beer and fear about that 106 degrees tomorrow 
2354 2018-07-22 17:58:56 Verified: Former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page met with representatives of Russian state-owned oil giant Rosneft.
2355 2018-07-22 17:58:55 Oil 
2356 2018-07-22 17:58:46 I wish I had one closer to my house.  I do the sub in a tub, but loaded with extra mayo, vinegar, oil and pepper relish.
2357 2018-07-22 17:58:45 Pepper,tomato,palm oil and salt for taste.

2358 2018-07-22 17:58:43 Put some oil in my hair, that means don’t ask me to go anywhere today. Scary movies and ice cream. #rainyday #therapy
2359 2018-07-22 17:58:35 Convergence of two trends seasoned w/a hell of a lot of money:
1. demographics. We will be a plurality w/in a decade. GOP is a party of white people scared of losing power.
2. Energy is moving from oligarch-controlled oil to renewables. GOP trying to save oil/coal from collapse.
2360 2018-07-22 17:58:33  try putting oil on your scalp it should help loosen it
2361 2018-07-22 17:58:29 It’s about that time to get an oil changed so here I am
2362 2018-07-22 17:58:24 “get your horny ass away from this house.” — kookie, 2018, oil on canvas.
2363 2018-07-22 17:58:23 I put tea tree oil on my butthole for no reason, now it feels nice and fresh.
#FeelingGood #feelingfresh #Impulse #random
2364 2018-07-22 17:58:18 Hatay & Golan in the past
Now most of Syria's oil will be lost to US supported kurds
Idlib, Afrin & N-Aleppo r lost 2 Turkey
There r even rumors about Nubbul/Al-Zahraa & even Aleppo city being handed over to Turkey not 2 mention Russia & Iran
Syria'll never be the same again
2365 2018-07-22 17:58:04 Well I do if you think they left because of some other reason than the price of oil plummeted.... cause they were leaving before Notley was elected....
2366 2018-07-22 17:58:04 maybe the bloke in red ,with the fat tummy, was having his 40th Birthday there ??!
2367 2018-07-22 17:57:55 MCT oil, depending on the chain length, should encourage production of ketones in the brain. Thus is great for anyone with neurological problems. Dr Mary Newport has a good lecture availible on YouTube worth watching. Easier to just use coconut oil to cook in though imo
2368 2018-07-22 17:57:49 Honestly same. There are very few things I love in life more than CBD oil & products.
2369 2018-07-22 17:57:46 No more blood for oil, we got our own battles to fight on our own soil
No more psychological warfare, to trick us to thinking that we ain't loyal
If we don't serve our own country, we're patronizing a hero
2370 2018-07-22 17:57:46 What the fuck do you know about science?! You don't even refine oil!!
2371 2018-07-22 17:57:40 ガウェインは強いからね！
2372 2018-07-22 17:57:35 Besides oil change and air filters lol
2373 2018-07-22 17:57:31 Can we please STOP it now!
2374 2018-07-22 17:57:17 I’ll deep fry the sausage in oil with my bare hands! 

Will the shoot be Baguio-based? I’m just here for the oiling. 
2375 2018-07-22 17:57:15 I’m pretty sure it’s his own BO that he’s smelling 
2376 2018-07-22 17:57:01 ما تجيبي ال tea tree oil وريحي دماغك
2377 2018-07-22 17:56:51 I am a Syrian who followed every detail of the conflict. ISIS was helped to infiltrate rebel areas & control the oil fields. At that point, Assad was about to fall with nearly 80% in rebel hands. Rebels soon confronted ISIS & managed to expell them from Aleppo .. 1/2
2378 2018-07-22 17:56:41 A doctor once cured cancer with canabis oil and won it at court. They killed him after. True or False?
2379 2018-07-22 17:56:38 Lol! Seriously, if you really want it to approximate anything fit for human consumption you HAVE use a blender. And coconut oil.
2380 2018-07-22 17:56:25 it’s all i love in this world i swear it.

i ran out of my oil yesterday 
2381 2018-07-22 17:56:11 I am one of those ppl who applaud you. Maybe the picture with Erdogan was a mistake- that can be debated.But by no means it can be the sole reason for bad performance!that's just hilarious link!When news see a spark, they just love to put oil in it.That's their dirty way
2382 2018-07-22 17:56:07 why does safeway have to super fry their chicken or wings to the point where they are dry? Had these awesome salt pepper vinegar and oil wings, but the inside was almost nasty over done.
2383 2018-07-22 17:55:59 And Trump opposing the Nordstream 2 pipeline that could boost Russia's profits in oil and natural gas, while also asking the Saudis to boost production so the sanctions against Iran don't drive oil prices up and increase Russian profits? It's a complicated mess.
2384 2018-07-22 17:55:57 Nice, Man. But Castrol Edge with Titanium Technology basically has all that stuff in 1 oil. It protects for 15,000 miles. My engine never knocked once.
2385 2018-07-22 17:55:57 I’d love this hemp oil is so healing, healed the ulcers on my ankles and fingers from neuropathic pain
2386 2018-07-22 17:55:56 You can cure anything with a banana, water, or coconut oil.
2387 2018-07-22 17:55:54 Coming close to internalizing Orwellian doublethink, the complete lack of cognitive dissonance. R’s have been demoralized, are in process of destabilizing & trying to normalize, not Trump, their oil alignment with Putin. At their meeting Putin came right out w price of oil.
2388 2018-07-22 17:55:35 アーサーって素のatk値が高いから素殴りが一番かなって……
2389 2018-07-22 17:55:33 Trey could use an oil change.

2395 2018-07-22 17:54:56 Sliced baguette with olive oil cooked on the grill with burrata is my favorite appetizer.
2396 2018-07-22 17:54:49 Olive oil? Ok
2397 2018-07-22 17:54:43 Can you tell me the brand of the fish oil you got in the mail and were talking about a few videos ago! I really want to get some to try for depression/anxiety
2398 2018-07-22 17:54:40 月の湯治だ！
2399 2018-07-22 17:54:38 Enjoying my Sunday today doing nothing on purpose!!! Getting my oil changed, hit this gym and back home. Not wasting gas since they’re both blocks away from the house #chillinlikeavillan for real
2400 2018-07-22 17:54:34 They do it right in the Mediterranean, Fresh vegetables, Seafood, olive oil and enjoy each meals like it's a special occasion. Better then me trying to scarf down my food in five minutes at break cause lunch is the only time I have available to get these gains.

2410 2018-07-22 17:53:14 Thinking back to the days being an edgy 8th grader vaping peppermint oil out of this essential oils defuser thing. that shit burned so fucking bad never did that again
2411 2018-07-22 17:53:11 I'll let the oil drip for you man with my hands full of force

2416 2018-07-22 17:52:41 It seems like it may be about these big two carving up the oil in the Arctic?  Trump ain't gonna get a seat at ExxonMobil but he may have other fantasies ahead of 2020.
2417 2018-07-22 17:52:30 covered in baby oil been even better
2418 2018-07-22 17:52:27 Use tea tree oil. That should help
2419 2018-07-22 17:52:22 Demand supply.. no one wants to watch oil merchants buying trophy.. Tough luck..
2420 2018-07-22 17:52:16 Accountable for what and how? 
As you should know, IF there is something, and so far nothing, the Congress has the power to hold him accountable.  SCOTUS cannot change that.
2421 2018-07-22 17:51:48 Try adding or spreading butter/oil on the pan before you put it in

2429 2018-07-22 17:50:19 I recommend the vagisil wash with the light blue lid or the purple lid, also you can dilute tea tree oil in a spray bottle with water and mist yourself to reduce odor and kill bacteria

2433 2018-07-22 17:49:52 How will this impact companies like exxon and shell? Their fixed costs haven't changed so they should make more profit if oil goes up, right?
2434 2018-07-22 17:49:50 This nigga Dre from Power slicker tyan a can of oil...i slick don’t want him to die no more 
2435 2018-07-22 17:49:48 Kudos to you and the leadership of Senate on the good works the 8th Assembly has being able to do......

2441 2018-07-22 17:49:08 You should try putting olive oil (organic) on your hair ends and let it sit for a few hours once a week before washing it (or overnight). It does wonders, especially for dry summer weather 
2442 2018-07-22 17:48:44 RT "RT itsoliviashosco: Gidi_Traffic NewsBytesNow And the name of the oil company will still not be mentioned #ThisisNigeria"

2444 2018-07-22 17:48:18 Corey Lewandowski involved with Russian energy. Rex Tillerson was involved with Russian energy. They all want that Russian oil!

2446 2018-07-22 17:47:44 Russia wants high oil prices. We want low oil prices. The Middle East is the battleground. There is no common goal in Syria.
2447 2018-07-22 17:47:43 Coal oil and gas will be around long after solar is gone to dust the same with wind they're unreliable intermittent in have to be supported

 Solar on average only works less than half day,that's if the Sun is shining, 
 Any cloud cover further reduces your production
2448 2018-07-22 17:47:35 A pea-sized amount of baby oil can act as a shine hair serum before dashing out the door.
2449 2018-07-22 17:47:26 Not just that war but all of American muscular foreign policy, and the propensity to lie about justification. Iraq was all about oil.

2455 2018-07-22 17:46:23 That's how I sent myself to fry fish and oil was splattering on my hand from every angle 
Came to the conclusion that culinary work is not my calling
2456 2018-07-22 17:46:17 No matter what party gets in, there will always be people who hate them. Albertas industry is oil, and always will be. Alberta's population won't stand for carbon taxing, they want they're social programs and infrastructure paid for by increased exports, not tax increases.

2458 2018-07-22 17:45:57 Man it seem like I be needing a brillo pad to get the oil/grease off my hands when I get off
2459 2018-07-22 17:45:54 One of my favorite vehicles was an 81 Audi 5000S Diesel. Went 318,000 miles without anything but oil changes. I once burned soybean oil in it, and until the day it was murdered on I95 in a snowstorm near Falmouth by a PLUMBING truck, it got 41 mpg
2460 2018-07-22 17:45:42 Aswear, oil dey yar head.
2461 2018-07-22 17:45:24 Same :) the most nerve racking part is when they are like let’s rest the oil thingy and they are like turn you key so far and press the gas this many times..and I always end up pumping the breaks 
2462 2018-07-22 17:45:05 ready to start experimenting with this hemp infused beard oil
2463 2018-07-22 17:45:04 I wouldn't be proud of giving the oil and gas industry a boost.
2464 2018-07-22 17:45:02 Enjoy Bozeman — my home town. Sadly overrun by Republicans, developers, Koch, and oil/gas hogs, et. al. Breaks my heart to see it today.
2465 2018-07-22 17:45:01 There is plenty of evidence though that opiates are killing people every single day. For me personally, I think exercise and a regular routine of stretching, then if nothing else works as far as conventional medicine, it wouldnt hurt you to try. That said.. oil over smoke anyday!
2466 2018-07-22 17:44:57 have u ever seen someone drop a regular taco on th floor and spew oil and natural gas into the kelp forests
2467 2018-07-22 17:44:50 Serious question, if I take CBD oil for anxiety relief is that breaking edge? A friend of mine gave me some to try I’m kinda conflicted on that
2468 2018-07-22 17:44:36 Many vegans avoid environmentally damaging products like palm oil. If your convince me I shouldn't have almond milk (I don't have any), I won't have it. That's how veganism works for the most part. We avoid single use plastics too.
2469 2018-07-22 17:44:13 It's a republican talking point to justify big oil that seeps into the minds of the feeble.
2470 2018-07-22 17:43:57 Mueller's indictments of Manafort, Podesta, Gates and even the raiding of Attorney Cohen office(s) have Ukraine all over them. 
Obama cabal helped overthrow the Ukraine gov. Kerry (friend)/Biden (son) moved in to "manage" Ukraines biggest oil/gas company. More to be uncovered.

I’m looking for someone with HR expertise and / or CV resume expertise (maybe more specifically in oil + gas).

Got any leads? 
2475 2018-07-22 17:43:19 Ya girl just got a free oil change #HOLLAAA
2476 2018-07-22 17:43:19 Due to a whole variety of factors not least the price of oil on the commodities market which has absolnothing to do with Brexit.
2477 2018-07-22 17:42:56 Why are we paying $1.29/liter when oil is at $68 or so? $0.065 is #carbontax and another 5% is GST!  How are Albertans affording this?  Oh right! They’re not!!!
2478 2018-07-22 17:42:51 Try weekly hair masks. The more natural the ingredients, the better. Something with avocado oil, Argan oil, or coconut oil. 
2479 2018-07-22 17:42:50 Havin a face mask, hair mask, coconut oil, soft ass feet, moisturized skin, fruit & water typa day 
2480 2018-07-22 17:42:42 tea tree oil is my savior i use it every night mixed in with my moisturizer and ever since i started doing that my acne has minimized so much
2481 2018-07-22 17:42:40 @realDonaldTrump All sanctions will be well implemented, and on November 4, 2018, Iran's oil exports will reach zero, with no exemptions. Crippling sanctions and embezzlement have broken the back of this regime and soon this criminal regime and plunder will collapse.
2482 2018-07-22 17:42:37 To invoke a true double negative (vs. a Trumpian one), There have never NOT been geological problems with U.S. tight oil. It's a source rock, not a reservoir rock!
2483 2018-07-22 17:42:28 It’s been a year since my@car has had an oil change  but hey better late than never
2484 2018-07-22 17:42:07 I need an oil that's not gonna make my hair feel brittle.
2485 2018-07-22 17:41:58 How'd Tillerson escape relatively unscathed? Maybe the oil makes him extra slippery...
2486 2018-07-22 17:41:56 Meat engine needs meat oil
2487 2018-07-22 17:41:53 *rubs poppers onto myself like essential oil*
2488 2018-07-22 17:41:51 For example:  Think about what we have seen on the news @NBCNews @CNN @ABC ...whoever the last 30yrs
Do u ever c any stories on our food system, or how our health care works, or how big the oil/gas companies r...or any hard hitting journalism?
No...because they get paid by them
2489 2018-07-22 17:41:39 Is it just me or does your tooth look like a bottle of oil?
2490 2018-07-22 17:41:31 probably drinking waterout of plasticbottles, made of oil!
2491 2018-07-22 17:41:23 #IslamicRegimeMustGo because of these crimes which we must hold accountable the ayatollahs for,kidnapping,fraud,money laundering,drug trafficking,drug selling,alcohol smuggling,oil smuggling and so on
2492 2018-07-22 17:41:22 It has it's moments. I spent 18 years on the ambulances before specialising in offshore/remote sites around the world. Due to the downturn in the oil n gas industry, I had to come back home and now work as an advisor on the phones. EMD is a nails-hard job not 4 the faint hearted.
2493 2018-07-22 17:41:17 Why do good skin twitter post pics looking drenched in baby oil? Is that the sign of good skin or something
2494 2018-07-22 17:41:13 the biggest lie is bio oil will get rid of your scars and stretch marks

2497 2018-07-22 17:40:40 He and others supported doing a study of the possibility of expansion but the oil spill is what changes the minds of the leaders of the commonwealth. So they decided to think of Virginia safety and environment instead of big money. I call that smart not weak @timkaine

The USA is trying hard to ignite war in the region. They do not care who win the war. They want to to make money from selling weapons, and to increase the oil price.

2559 2018-07-22 17:32:18 yes regime buys friends and popularty with Iranianpeoople oil revenue, with out spending money you won't have a friend. as for Russia they laughing as we pay for the cost of proxy war in syria as we as buying their arms.
2560 2018-07-22 17:32:18 I’ve tried buttered coffee. It was OK, but I’d rather have cream or milk or just black. Now, one place I go does coconut oil in coffee. That was not too bad because of the hint of coconut, but it’s also not gonna be for everyone. And then there a places that do PB mochas. /1
2561 2018-07-22 17:32:14 I took my Fish oil, plus Mega red, and a CQ10. They are great for your heart and joints. Thanks. I am well rested, thanks for your concern.

2567 2018-07-22 17:31:30 You can do it. Nigeria has oil and natural resources (minerals, mines). Nigeria Air can become a reality. Jamaica is way smaller and with less money than Nigeria and we had Air Jamaica. It became Caribbean Airlines. So, Nigeria can do it.

2582 2018-07-22 17:29:26 I’m struggling with the term “real mayonnaise”. What’s real about a product whose first ingredient is processed vegetable oil.

2585 2018-07-22 17:29:10 Disagree. Pivetta is leaking oil for a while now. Too soon to pull him but they don’t have to ride out the season. He’s not a proven commodity. #phillies
2586 2018-07-22 17:28:49 The only thing squirting out of that manatee is cooking oil.
2587 2018-07-22 17:28:38 I prevented my husband from needing gall bladder removal by getting him to fast for 3 days drinking just applejuice and olive oil. 4 significantly large stones broke down to many small insignificant ones and sludge so they cancelled at my insitance of a second look first.

2591 2018-07-22 17:28:19 I like being able to take my firearms apart easily to clean, or work on them.
If you loc-tite the screws on an oil hardened frame then have to use heat
( a torch) to remove them, you can damage and/or destroy the colorful oil
hardening finish.
2592 2018-07-22 17:28:10 Oil is a bonus. Scotland has a varied and thriving economy and is the only country within the UK that runs a trade surplus rather than a deficit
2593 2018-07-22 17:28:10 I feel so good! Did a hot oil treatment for my hair and took a sparkly bath. I smell good and am shimmery. Oh man, this is so nice. I even feel the Hallelujah chorus.

Quite literally. I sang a few hallelujahs.
2594 2018-07-22 17:28:07 ‘‘The White Helmets are courageous volunteers and first responders who risk their lives to help their fellow Syrians who have been targeted by senseless violence." @cafreeland   Senseless violence for oil.

2596 2018-07-22 17:27:47 So thankful we have true leadership in Canada, imagine having that coward, Trump as your leader, wow, what a mess. I take Trudeau over Trump all day every day and I live and work in the Alberta oil patch.

2599 2018-07-22 17:27:05 That’s your opinion and none of us actually know that. The SNP have never come up with the answers to the crucial economic and financial questions so to say it’s not the case is nothing more than a punt. Given the reliance on the Oil figures in 2014 our economy would have bombed.

2619 2018-07-22 17:23:53 We shall see. I think we will see things play out a bit faster than that , the way the Venezuelan economy and oil industry has collapsed. Would say that China and Russia have offered lifelines to Venezuela. Without those lifelines , Venezuela would have already imploded.
2620 2018-07-22 17:23:11 I don't drink coffee (I know, I'm weird.), but I assumed coconut oil would make things more, um, slippery? (AKA massive shits) Kind of like how White Castle burgers are called "sliders." - The grease helps them slide right back out. 
2621 2018-07-22 17:22:57 You squeeze the pit of the olive. All oil comes from seeds.

2623 2018-07-22 17:22:47 Proving that you and other Remainers are economically illiterate. The oil price has absolutely nothing to do with Brexit or the EU. The reduction in currency value which a number of financial institutions said was over-valued before the referendum has enabled exporters to benefit

2630 2018-07-22 17:21:30 You also find them inside Ubeji by Deeper Road in their vehicle on broad day light watching oil bunkers as they buy and sell illegal diesel. They even put the lives of passersby in danger as their trucks block the road completely.

2634 2018-07-22 17:20:51 Is this the reason that the Government of Canada has purchased a pipeline which it will be expanding to increase oil production from the tar sands?

2636 2018-07-22 17:20:32 @TomBossert45 Today talking with @GStephanopoulos you mention Russia’s landmass?
We’ve never been attacked by a “landmass”
Their 145m+ pop. We have 325m+
They have oil, so do we!
So what they did is ok? We should be afraid of them
@realDonaldTrump is afraid &...

2641 2018-07-22 17:19:07 Argan oil!! If u want a very simple one lol, but it’s good for all skin types! I have combination oily skin and I think it helps w having too much oil production. And if u have dry skin it’s great for that too!

2644 2018-07-22 17:18:30 You mean like dissuading Germany from using Russian oil, which would enrich Russia? How about selling arms to Ukraine so that they can defend themselves against Russia—a move the Obama Adm opposed? Sanctions? Much tougher under Trump than Obama.

2647 2018-07-22 17:18:01 I applied at a gas station in s. texas once, home of the oil & gas industry. I had lost my job after becoming ill & was having a hard time finding work. I was offered $6.50/hr & it wasn't full time. You wouldn't get hired if you had another job.
2648 2018-07-22 17:18:00 โอเชค่า ขอบคุณนะคะ
2649 2018-07-22 17:17:59 Ill buy d oil. Pay for my fare and all just to do this and im just in baguio. ;)
2650 2018-07-22 17:17:55 Mix half cup (liquid-microwave if needed) virgin coconut oil and half c cocoa powder. Pour in mini muffins cups on cookie tray and freeze. Can also add almond butter to the middle for a more Reese’s like treat.

2652 2018-07-22 17:17:44 Carter Page is a trader of Russian Oil/Commobities. Big deal. He has done not 1 damned thing wrong.
2653 2018-07-22 17:17:40 And the name of the oil company will still not be mentioned #ThisisNigeria
2654 2018-07-22 17:17:34 @ORIGINBJJ @echocharles @jockowillink  if you could only take 1, which would it be? Super Krill oil or Joint Warfare
2655 2018-07-22 17:17:32 Yeah. I started using it when I quit smoking because I started feeling really stupid. Won’t get you as hype as caffeine. Also if you put it in a carrier oil (jojoba, almond, vitamin E) it can help thicken your edges
2656 2018-07-22 17:17:31 It started long before Obama! You seem to forget the constant hunting of Bill and Hillary, afterall Bill defeated the king of big oil.... Daddy Bush!
2657 2018-07-22 17:17:16 You mean saudi sells oil* its literally their m.o

2664 2018-07-22 17:16:16 @RealJayWilliams I’m watching Best Shot and its amazing but I have a question about what CBD oil you use on your knee?
2665 2018-07-22 17:16:14 Coconut oil, you can get at Holland and barratt or a supermarket as it's a cooking ingredient too. 

Make sure it's pure. So avoid buying it from a hair shop lol
2666 2018-07-22 17:16:10 Alright all this should “fix” my car.

• new battery 
• oil change 
• mass air flow sensor
• ignition wires
• distributor cap

I’ll update y’all on how this goes.
2667 2018-07-22 17:16:08 In order for the (anointing) oil to flow, you have to respect the "Pot" it comes from! #TheFlow
2668 2018-07-22 17:16:02 I now challenge you (Obasanjo) to search your soul, very deeply, and swear to this nation that you never awarded oil blocks in return for sexual gratification.I do not make accusations lightly and I despise snide insinuations.I believe you know me well enough.And I am no prude...
2669 2018-07-22 17:15:48 A great meeting with Putin would be Crimea back in the Ukraine, Bashar Assad out, an admission that Russia interfered in our elections, a commitment to stop ship-to-ship transfers of oil to North Korea, or the end of Russian cooperation with OPEC or just one of the above.

2671 2018-07-22 17:15:42 Sometimes I just rub the entirety of my body in coconut oil until I love myself again
2672 2018-07-22 17:15:40 Neal’s Yard Remedies is probs the best place, but it can be expensive depending which one you’re looking to get. Holland & Barrett should sell them too. Look for places that sell 100% coconut, almond, jojoba oil, etc.

-Spicy Garlic Parm, saute butter/garlic in a pan, add hot sauce and some Parm cheese.
-Or Salt and Vinegar wings.
-Double frying is key. When wings float, remove from oil and let sit for few mins, then re-fry for a few more mins. Perfect crisp.

2679 2018-07-22 17:14:20 Hey, it's Olive Oil. I've been pondering if after all these jiffies you'd like to be original.

2681 2018-07-22 17:14:04 Try a scrambled egg sometime.  Scramble an egg really well. Pour coffee over.  Fat without the oil.  Better than it sounds.  Sugar can help too.
2682 2018-07-22 17:14:03 Depends, on what you are talking about in science.
Nobody disputes that nuclear radiation, or a large oil spill, is bad for the environment.
Some corn, have been genetically altered, to kill insects, when they eat the corn.

2688 2018-07-22 17:13:21 Really? I haven't seen or heard of this. CBD oil I do use for BP, and give my dog for seizures. So what. That works. Sex toys could be good. How would that work? Would that be guaranteed orgasms? Who wouldn't want that? Big deal...
2689 2018-07-22 17:13:20 Brittany is a  health specialties teacher that likes Sesame oil on their feta pizza with orange juice
2690 2018-07-22 17:13:20 Serve there political needs and to line their pockets. It amazes me that in a communist country that Putin has become the richest man in the world. Taking all the oil profits and putting none of it back into the people and they support him. Not My understanding of communism
2691 2018-07-22 17:13:16 The money Nigeria makes yearly from crude oil is more than the aid given to Africa.

2693 2018-07-22 17:13:07 Birthday presents are so much less fun when you get older. My mom keeps asking what I want and all I can think of is an oil change and a 6month supply of contacts
2694 2018-07-22 17:13:06 This is more like those failed students getting support from system to get passed & the student who burnt the midnight oil not getting the credit

2695 2018-07-22 17:13:05 They should; but I doubt the US government have any interest in the persecution of innocent people in Burma. They would be interested in Burma's gas and oil deposits, but that could bring them into potential conflict with China

2701 2018-07-22 17:11:59 I understand the feeling of urgency with the trade battle going on. I am pleased to see The President and  his team working on easing the burden on the farmers. I just wish Obama had done the same thing for all of us oil workers that lost their jobs in 2015.
2702 2018-07-22 17:11:58 I have a testimony of the anointing oil service I was watching online...I connected with my bottle of oil&after that I applied it on my ankle that's been troubling me for a month.... The pain disappeared instantly! Papa @UebertAngel your God is too much! I thank GOD!

2725 2018-07-22 17:08:49 Jacob Rees-Mogg is an intellectual lightweight who gets away with this sort of nonsense because he speaks with a posh accent. He's a snake oil oil salesman folks. Don't buy this rubbish.
2726 2018-07-22 17:08:44 ...and medicines, and oil, and gas, and (I’m guessing) the wine cellar at the Palace of Westminster dining club.

2729 2018-07-22 17:08:32 Are you kidding me?  A Jewish Harvard graduate supporting neo-Nazi!!  Very sad what oil $ is doing to the American intellect.  By same token, we ask whether Qatar and MB reimburse YOU pro bono or per tweet? where do you get off on false assumptions?  Shame on you Nathan Lean.
2730 2018-07-22 17:08:30 My moms car is completely fucked bc the mechanic forgot to put the oil in holllly shit
2731 2018-07-22 17:08:29 Car gettin a oil change so i went and grabbed my other thing 
2732 2018-07-22 17:08:27 Schiff, you are SO wrong. If Russia was compromising POTUS, why would he care about Germany’s oil buy, why would he insist that NATO move forward re: cyber security & terrorism. There wasn’t any Russian Collusion. Get over it. The Dem report was a sham
2733 2018-07-22 17:08:21 Just when I’m starting to feel grown and ready to take on life i noticed I’m 1000 miles over on getting my oil changed. Not ready

2742 2018-07-22 17:07:41 The docs release yesterday shows he had a part ownership in a Russians oil company and his former foreign advisor appear to have “informal convo and meeting” with Russian government besides the normal communication.  so much to read tbh.
2743 2018-07-22 17:07:38 I myself have dry skin so im not so familiar with oily skin. Use gel based cleansers and no matter what use oil free moisturizer and Dont over-dry your skin.

2745 2018-07-22 17:07:25 You’re an oil club that has a predisposition for cringeworthy behaviour - I appreciate that’s a tricky concept.
2746 2018-07-22 17:07:19 I had a babe like that,I love her so much ,she's suffering from asthma ,each time there's an attack ,when it subside,her mum calls me to comfort her.
2747 2018-07-22 17:07:18 Amount is = to current sum of tariffs - sanctions / golf trips + fed and oil tweets. Translated in #POTUS terms as...not enough.
2748 2018-07-22 17:07:16 Why do people always assume when they check engine light pops on they need an oil change lol That’s not how it works 
2749 2018-07-22 17:07:12 Rosemary. Ive used the oil for aromatherapy and it’s great. Or if you can find supplement to work internally, that’s good too

2752 2018-07-22 17:06:52 Pal, there is only so much oil in the ground. Takes thousands of years to produce new oil naturally. Don’t you think it is wiser to let THEM run out of oil many many yesrs before us?
2753 2018-07-22 17:06:49 0bama's #PenPhoneRegulations on oil was #collusion with #russia ! There's nothing (besides letting Putin have The Crimea, not protecting EastEurope & sweethearting Iran that Putin would like more!  #0bamaRussiaCollusion

2755 2018-07-22 17:06:43 WHY DID I GO TO PCC NATURAL MARKET. NOW ALL I WANT IS TO COVER MYSELF IN BERRY SEED OIL AND RAW HONEY SO I CAN TRANSFORM INTO A LITERAL FRUIT SALAD WITH THIS HOLISTIC WITCHCRAFT

2757 2018-07-22 17:06:39 Government Regulations and the continued fall off or evening when oil process feel to the floor. I was laid off that time for 10 months. I finally got another good how 9 months ago which was 10 months into Trump's Presidency. I was homeless for years due to Dems policies.
2758 2018-07-22 17:06:33 Disagree.
No matter how frantically this concoction is blended, butter, coconut oil MIXED into coffee tastes abominable. Triggers gag reflex instantly. 

I was fortunate to stand next to a sink the first and only time I tried a sip. You like this stuff? KEEP IT and away from me.
2759 2018-07-22 17:06:32 Why am I getting anxiety while I’m getting an oil change? Like I’ve never done this before. My anxiety is out for blood!! 
2760 2018-07-22 17:06:28 Going in a relationship is kinda like a use car.
If the oil don't smell good, something is wrong and need to change it.
Essence, if having a negative feeling about the person best you Dont waste your time going into something that you can't tolerate and not healthy for you.

2776 2018-07-22 17:04:50 I've got passable French. But first time I visited the Arcachon region, the old d'oc vs d'oil reared its head! They insist they can't understand French people from Paris! You've no chance with grammar school French!
2777 2018-07-22 17:04:48 Took Chanel to the groomers, got an oil change, and got a car washed today. Feeling very productive 
2778 2018-07-22 17:04:46 My hair is really growing s/o to wild growth oil treatment
2779 2018-07-22 17:04:27 Still amazed at at how bad the country got in the 8 years Dems were in control. I was literally unemployed for 5 of those years working mostly minimum wage jobs with the exception of being Chef Manager on a Oil Platform in the Gulf. Which I was laid off twice sure to.....
2780 2018-07-22 17:04:23 Also a "fair" amt of success with Avon's Skin So Soft Bath Oil - but could be a problem with the body paint!!! Lately what we have been using is Avon's  Bug Guard-and that seems to work-just not on the ones that follow us-get in the house & bite later. ACV is great for itching :)
2781 2018-07-22 17:04:01 An S&P 500 index portfolio with a 10% Crude Oil mix ↑ return 1.2% & ↓ risk 86.6% over past 6 Wks
2782 2018-07-22 17:03:57 Ke tswa ko Solly a re his waiting for the oil what what then after that the car will be fine
2783 2018-07-22 17:03:41 Lmao funny enough , I actually TRIED to be careful . I had half a plate of basmati rice with 2 pcs of turkey fried in olive oil and a small sized bottle of coke 
2784 2018-07-22 17:03:30 This is what Trump wants is a big ugly war. The kind where military soldiers come back home in body bags. America is very dependent on oil this could get really bad really fast.
2785 2018-07-22 17:03:21 Inilah Essential Oil favourite saya dan suami. 100% pure lavender oil. Tiap2 malam sebelum tidur wajib diffuse ni, confirm lena dan dpt manfaat deep sleep. Bangun pagi tiada lg lesu dan malas bangun. Rasa nyenyak dan cukup jer tidur, rasa lebih semangat nk bekerja.

2788 2018-07-22 17:02:56 12 wk. bubble chart S&P 500 vs. Crude Oil ... what can a -0.487 correlation do for you?
2789 2018-07-22 17:02:50 i feel like castor oil will make my hair greasy
2790 2018-07-22 17:02:48 I bought 3 Wes Anderson movies yesterday. When do I get my lifetime supply of moustache oil, hipster barber haircuts, and craft IPA's?
2791 2018-07-22 17:02:40 The Dems are too smart to buy this snake oil...they have talked to their constituents and know that the “tax cuts” only benefitted the rich and NOT ANYBODY ELSE!
I guess when you support a lying moron, you become a liar yourself
SHAMEFUL!!
2792 2018-07-22 17:02:39 All out on oil, saddest of times! Next time I change strings I'm gonna buy some at the same time!
2793 2018-07-22 17:02:39 i don't even know where to begin. colonizers destabilized the middle-east region then swooped in under the guise of being its saviors when the real reason was (very transparently, Brzezinski basically wrote a book that read like a manual outlining what they would do) securing oil
2794 2018-07-22 17:02:20 #China anti-#Democracy #regime props up #Venezuela #Dictator Maduro so #Beijing can exploit #Caracas #Oil #industry. #Chinese company given valuable hydrocarbon concessions from properties expropriated from #ExxonMobil.

2798 2018-07-22 17:01:25 ขออนุญาติสอบถามค่ะ แบบแกะกับไม่แกะเท่าไหร่บ้างคะ
2799 2018-07-22 17:01:03 You don't and never have,,the opposite is the case
40 years of taking 92% of scots oil revenues which have propped up England for 40 years Eli.
The choice is not Englands either its scotlands,and scots have had enough of propping up tories we don't vote for,and idiots like you
2800 2018-07-22 17:01:00 Little bit of lemon oil and she'll be as pretty as she was new
2801 2018-07-22 17:00:49 People wrongly assume that #oil is becoming a thing of the past.
2802 2018-07-22 17:00:47 @SouthernRailUK you seriously need to oil the seat back trays on your trains! they make an awful racket!!!!!
2803 2018-07-22 17:00:43 And finally live with whatever oil you ve got

Do these things and trust me
Muslims would leave your country on their own
2804 2018-07-22 17:00:37 “Art of the Steal” tRump forgot to tell Americans that he literally plays to lose. He’s “lost” on many business ventures and now he’s selling out our country for a cut of Putin’s oil. He is a TRAITOR. TRAITOR TRUMP.
2805 2018-07-22 17:00:32 Yes let's look at that:
Sanctions
Sold Arms to Ukraine
Told Germany to end oil deal
Expelled Russian diplomats 
Closed 3 Russian sites 

You fail to realize that Russia has been meddling for decades and the DNC is at fault for not properly securing servers. But what did we learn?

2812 2018-07-22 17:00:15 Maybe I’m late, but last night I unintentionally discovered that if you lather your entire body in coconut oil, mosquitoes won’t bite you 
2813 2018-07-22 17:00:14 coconut oil helps w everything
2814 2018-07-22 17:00:10 No one comes out of this looking good, unless xander wins and second is an 8 car pile up and oil fire

2816 2018-07-22 17:00:00 I can't wait for this shift to finish, so I can go home, put coconut oil on my hair, exfoliate with @frank_bod, do my nails, put a face mask on, & watch a film... & then slowly slip into a much needed sleep 
2817 2018-07-22 16:59:47 Pretty soon Germany will offer to pay for oil with condoms
2818 2018-07-22 16:59:38 Its true but for a government who inherited 3new oil fields with its integrated gas supply, infrastructures only talks about debts.
2819 2018-07-22 16:59:38 I guess it depends on what kind of toast and what you have on it. 

Hand-made noodle soup with shrimp, cumin, soy and sesame oil is hard to top.
2820 2018-07-22 16:59:22 Cetaphil. Done wonders for my face.

For something natural, I know some people use coconut oil, but make sure your skin is damp when applying as it need moisture to retain.
2821 2018-07-22 16:59:04 Yup I fried them in a little oil for a few minutes first. For the sauce I just used tomato puree, garlic and onion powder, mixed herbs, smoked paprika, Himalayan salt and pepper and some sriracha and a squirt of agave and thinned it with a little water 
2822 2018-07-22 16:59:01 If only these guys that are changing the oil in my car would quit staring at me through the window, my car would get done faster 
2823 2018-07-22 16:58:58 This is luxury food!
There is a simpler, less elaborate version of SHARMOOLA (tomatoes + green hot peppers + salt + olive oil). That would be the quick & dirty male version that construction workers can whip up quickly on their lunch break.
2824 2018-07-22 16:58:36 I feel your …. itch Kalani!!  In the past - had "fairly" good results with "Buzz Away" insect repellent -has essential oils like "Geranium" or just Geranium on it's own with a carrier like coconut oil.  But I have heard ANYTHING with scent  has estrogenic effects in the body.
2825 2018-07-22 16:58:28 GOOD MORNING!

I dunno why but I keep having super mundane dreams. Like last night I dreamt about mowing the lawn, and getting the oil changed in my car. Now I actually have to do those things.
It's like I have to do all my chores twice, not fair.
2826 2018-07-22 16:58:27 God gave my a sign this morning to stop eating by burning my finger with boiling ass bacon oil
2827 2018-07-22 16:58:24 I use both the oil and a salve to help my Trigeminal Neuralgia.  I do use it in conjunction with medication.
2828 2018-07-22 16:58:17 Everything he does is to drive us into an energy deficit, from his handling of pipelines, dependence on foreign oil, his insistence of energy sources with a poor EROI, down to attempting to tax the combustion reaction and the use of energy itself.
2829 2018-07-22 16:58:12 Did they find OIL their? Some other $$$ Resource the US wants?
Why say civil war when it is regime change for resources the US wants?

2832 2018-07-22 16:57:58 Choose to love.

Not oil prices,
Royal babies,
Conniving jurists,
Enhanced performers,

2835 2018-07-22 16:57:52 The amount of truffles and olive oil I got on this trip could probably last me the next 2 years.
2836 2018-07-22 16:57:49 Ion like grapeseed oil in my hair. I feel like after 2 days, there's this sticky residue.
2837 2018-07-22 16:57:44 i really like the garden fairy oil! it makes my skin feel so moisturized and smells amazing.
2838 2018-07-22 16:57:37 I love  anything that makes America More Energy Independent & Reduces The World’s Dependence On OPEC!!
It Is Time To  Tell The Arabs, Keep Your Oil. We Don’t Want Your Oil Or  Your Conflicts!!

2840 2018-07-22 16:57:22 You mean planting maize on a 1,000 hectare farm and drawing water 500m away? Last time I checked, one needs a big John Deere or Massey Fergasson tractor, drums of oil, drums of diesel, salary for the driver/s, fertilizer and various implements. Money........
2841 2018-07-22 16:57:13 Shame on you Krauss for such piss poor journalism.

 You've painted Guyana as a poor country that looks to oil for saving... You've failed to highlight one positive thing about this country. 

I suppose the country is as poor as your dying career.
2842 2018-07-22 16:57:12 Blending the coffee and (butter, coconut oil, cream, even milk) creates tiny luscious clouds of creaminess around droplets of coffee. Same thing happens blending strong, deep chai tea and milk. Heavenly.
2843 2018-07-22 16:57:09 You talm bout a foot massage with a lil warm oil till them foot kisses start
2844 2018-07-22 16:57:02 Does this, along with productivity drop from ‘16 indicate we are seeing geological problems in US tight oil?
2845 2018-07-22 16:56:51 Mixing the oil into organic peanut butter is one of the quickest ways to understand the hardships the pioneers endured.
2846 2018-07-22 16:56:50 Lavender oil!!! It helps haha
2847 2018-07-22 16:56:47 Thanks Chef, FYI nothing for sale. But seriously why do they put cannabinoids in a MCT like coconut oil. #hemp seed-oil should / will be the carrier oil of the Cannabis industry
2848 2018-07-22 16:56:42 giiiiiirl I wish I still had some CBD oil so all of this organizing I’m doing gets done right and quick!!
2849 2018-07-22 16:56:41 I must admit- the majority of my “episodes” have gone exactly like this! Most of the time I can preemt it (when I remember) and take high strength Evening primrose oil starting a week before.. It’s an absolute godsend- even helps with bloating/ sore boobs etc. 
2850 2018-07-22 16:56:34 I also put smoked paprika on the side that goes on the skillet first, then added some to the other side before flipping, the paprika helps it brown and get a crispy finish, i also used olive oil with balsamic vinegar which also helps get it crispy and good.

They're desperate to believe POTUS is in Putin's pocket.

2864 2018-07-22 16:53:59 Getting oil changes for old/high mileage vehicles is not cheap. 
2865 2018-07-22 16:53:35 Israel wants that oil in the Syrian mountains and was trying to get through Assad to get it. The company that wanted to drill that oil is involved with someone who works very closely with Jared Kushner.

2876 2018-07-22 16:51:55 This whole thing has been a huge game.. the white helmets were put in place to try to get the us into a war in Syria. The goal was to get rid of Bashar Assad so that Israel could get oil that was recently discovered in the Syrian mountains.

2911 2018-07-22 16:47:55 Yeah, really gaining momentum. Just over 17 Million more signatures needed to get beyond 17.4 Million Leave number. What a bunch of snake oil shysters you lot are. You, umunna, soubry et al purposely patronizing decent folk who did their civic duty to cast vote which you resent

2915 2018-07-22 16:47:48 Coconut oil! I damaged my hair so bad last winter that half my hair snapped off. I've been trying to get it healthy again. I always soak my hair in coconut oil for at least 30 minutes before washing and it makes it amazingly soft and smooth.

2919 2018-07-22 16:47:16 So what is your education? Have you test drive a Tesla, do you understand the technology as compared to oil?  Do you know the efficiencies of the motors compared to a gasoline engine?  I do!  I worked in an oil refinery for 30 years and I research!
2920 2018-07-22 16:47:08 Then this area right here called to me. I'll go and explore properly later. *Raising to my knees I motion for you to turn onto your front and continue massaging the oil into your skin* I honestly can't thank you enough for bringing us here baby. You've surpassed any >>

2922 2018-07-22 16:47:00 Sterling’s overvaluation came when we became an oil exporter and that killed UK manufacturing.

UK exports have done very well since sterling lost some of its ridiculous high value.

2928 2018-07-22 16:46:09 Oil is the black snake the grandmothers warn us about - we need to kill black snake and leave oil in earth and use renewable energy by sun and wind

2930 2018-07-22 16:45:52 Which means theyd cut off ALL OIL EXPORTS! 

That would Fuck the @WhiteHouse & USA in a nano second for yrs to come

@ReutersIran 

Even if the DS over took Iran theyd blow up their own oil refineries if it was a last stand. But believe it. Currently IRAN has Big power. BNFL...

2936 2018-07-22 16:45:04 Nigeria is an islamist and jihadist enclave. It serves crude oil purpose of Britain who put it together and handed it over to a bunch of vicious islamist terrorists like Buhari for supervision. Did you know, Ghana took a few days to rid her soil of the terrorist fulani herdsmen?

2940 2018-07-22 16:44:43 Did they also ban natural gas and oil as well?
2941 2018-07-22 16:44:38 It’s said that Malaysia? Got palm oil seedlings from NGR some years ago & today has overtaken NGR in palm oil production. NGR will get overtaken in any or all productive activities until it weans itself of dependence from imports & starts being productive
2942 2018-07-22 16:44:38 In part I agree with the idea of the carbon tax at least on paper. But it's just a way for the Federal Liberals to fund the purchase of the Kenden Morgan pipeline so the Turdea Liberals can continue to sell out oil to the Americans so they can sell it. What a F@# joke.
2943 2018-07-22 16:44:27 新地開拓するかぁ
2944 2018-07-22 16:44:18 Not at all. UN is against israel as israel has done a lot of bad since partition from breaching intl law, illegal ownership and testing of nukes, bullying Iran for oil..... the whole 9 yards.

2951 2018-07-22 16:43:27 Good plan. Chives, spring onion greens, garlic-infused olive oil, potatoes and rice will get you through. With bread, remember you don't have to cut it out totally. You can have 2 slices of sourdough - lots of people think you have to cut out gluten but you don't. Good luck!

2956 2018-07-22 16:43:00 I'll actually keep this grey. I only use black and white paint, and mix as I go. Since this is oil, I'll mix it more on canvas, than I will on the pallet.

Thank you so much, sweetie! I really love what I do, and I appreciate it so much! If you ever need art anything, DM 
2957 2018-07-22 16:42:53 I'd like to see Democrats use more arguments Republicans can get behind. E.g., depending on oil is not just bad because of climate change. It is bad for national security. Iran and Russia are oil states. Why give money to people who hate us? Renewables make our enemies poor.
2958 2018-07-22 16:42:48 @RobertAlai how do you feel about this amazing #kenyanAvengers of police, NEMA & ERC busting crude oil smugglers? is it a case of good cooks?
2959 2018-07-22 16:42:45 good, don't want to fink about the risks of hot oil for either of you. make sure all oil cleaned up
2960 2018-07-22 16:42:17 On oil and gas you dumbtard. The Russian govt owns the oil companies so you have to advise them. 
The State Dept knows that, which is why the State Dept approved the travel.
2961 2018-07-22 16:41:58 Oh don't forget about limiting airplanes that uses fossil fuels (oil) as well and going with fully solar/electric planes

3045 2018-07-22 16:30:21 Tiger is leaking oil now.
3046 2018-07-22 16:30:18 power move actually, like i normally spend $62 on an oil change and i ended up spending $132 on like 3 extra things because they Highly Recommended it. if they wont talk me into extra stuff im already there
3047 2018-07-22 16:30:12 Oil is renewable energy. What have you been smoking.
3048 2018-07-22 16:30:02 Rosins, hydrocarbons, guar, acrylic, plantago, PAM … even soybean oil; these are just some of the options that are available when selecting a tackifier.
3049 2018-07-22 16:29:48 Castor oil isn’t skin bleach lol idk what you talking about ma’am
3050 2018-07-22 16:29:42 I worked in oil, gas & chemical industry my whole career. The last 25 yrs, everyone was pee tested/breathalyzed randomly. I saw numerous good employees become unemployed. Even if drugs are legalized, some jobs will still be off limits for the non-sober. Choices have consequences.
3051 2018-07-22 16:29:40 Oil is gone now he’s losing the wheels
3052 2018-07-22 16:29:32 very good but what about price hike of oil and GDP,FDI ETCCCCCCCCC
3053 2018-07-22 16:29:28 Leaking oil. Dang.
3054 2018-07-22 16:29:25 Mama mia
3055 2018-07-22 16:29:21 I think I will grill some drumstick tonight. I am thinking a spice rub using olive oil and curry powder.
3056 2018-07-22 16:29:15 Maybe he meant to say he was worried that NOT legalizing weed would lead to Sex toys WITHOUT weed oil
3057 2018-07-22 16:29:00 Couple of thoughts on ingest-ables. THC + liver metabolism = different high some love it. infusion method = taste, IMO if you can’t taste it (ripple) why bother. the LPs make oil and they’ll all make single serve confections. a $10 lollipop has $9.50 margin.
3058 2018-07-22 16:28:52 The people telling me to add coconut oil...I’m like, um more fat is not going to improve the taste! it will slow down my gut

"They want to do to Libya what they did to Iraq and what they are itching to do to Iran. They want to take the oil." - Gaddafi, 1942 - 2011.
3063 2018-07-22 16:27:49 Can someone find me thc oil for kids that have muscle spasms
3064 2018-07-22 16:27:31 So need oil is an aphrodisiac now!!??
3065 2018-07-22 16:27:31 Access to oil is the issue!
3066 2018-07-22 16:27:21 I think he means the one that resulted from America’s last regime change in Iran, on behalf of BP.

This time we’ll do better. Honest.

We learned so much in Iraq, Libya. Syria. Yemen.

Surely.

If we go it will be for the oil, not the people. It will not go well for them.

3069 2018-07-22 16:26:10 A ver, in poquito de por favor, estos años de atrás nos han subido la gasolina y el gas oil el doble de lo que lo va a subir ahora el gobierno y nadie a protestado, y ahora que se quieren subir 10 ctms al gasoil nos ponemos histéricos? o como lo subía el pp dolía menos?
3070 2018-07-22 16:26:09 "I now challenge you(Obasanjo) to search your soul,very deeply, and swear to this nation that you never awarded oil blocks in return for sexual gratification. I do not make accusations lightly and I despise snide insinuations.I believe you know me well enough. And I am no prude,"
3071 2018-07-22 16:26:05 So seriously, it was the year I was told I’d be alive when the oil ran out!! Those exact words. I’ve literally spent a lifetime questioning what that meant!!
No space dust though. Sadly
3072 2018-07-22 16:26:05 She needs new shocks all the way around, new rear brakes, new tires and I believe the timing chain casing has a small crack that's dripping oil slowly. So she's running on borrowed time unfortunately. 6 going on 7 years and she was used when I got her.
3073 2018-07-22 16:25:42 USA and poodles trying to control natural resources, oil in Iran and Syria, minerals in Afghanistan. Control the resources you control Russia and China.

3077 2018-07-22 16:24:09 True that! Another common oncology patient family folklore: questions like "What other natural supplements/vitamins can you add? My beloved one (pt) is only on flax seeds, fish oil, ginger, green tea, selenium, turmeric powder, and vit A-Z at the moment"
3078 2018-07-22 16:24:01 The world’s five biggest meat and dairy producers emit more combined greenhouse gases than ExxonMobil, Shell, or BP, the top three oil production companies, according to a new report by GRAIN and the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy (IATP).

3080 2018-07-22 16:23:48 There are all kinds of reasons they aren’t cost effective, some because of technological advancement, some because they don’t want them to be. As a for instance, bp just got more money to build an off shore oil station than renewables received in last decade. That’s 1 station.
3081 2018-07-22 16:23:48 Tea tree oil pho? :/ w si pakenya Cetaphil sama Himalaya (St. Ives juga enak!! tapi kalo dompet ndut) tapi sebelumnya pake perasan buah lemon  dulu ji, perih sih tapi bikin seger muka gitu, dibilas, trus baru cuci muka.

3085 2018-07-22 16:23:23 I think it's time for the Iranians to say bye bye to say, an oil refinery. Or their busiest port. Or maybe the Quds leadership.
3086 2018-07-22 16:23:14 That is Great to hear. I wish NYC was Clean and had Laws with all the taxes we pay. I plan to take a trip to canada want to see how beautiful I hear it is. Yes that is surprise with the oil canada has your prices are so high.

anyone who supports the #Barbaric #Zionist #Imperialist wars and blood for oil program is complicit in #CrimesAgainstHumanity
3089 2018-07-22 16:23:03 And on top of that even the oil rich Islamic Gulf States are utterly backward on social policy and cultural attitudes
3090 2018-07-22 16:23:02 We now know Putin killed the Mitt Romney Sec of State role, but who DID they want?  Tillerson, the oil man with ZERO political experience.

3094 2018-07-22 16:22:47 Yes myths like you need milk to get calcium. It's a con, the dairy industry has more money than the oil industry and they have everyone fooled. This isn't just vegan propaganda btw. You don't need milk for calcium. Its science!
3095 2018-07-22 16:22:14 Tigers leaking oil but still has a shot

3099 2018-07-22 16:21:39 @TomBossert45 @TomBossert said, “The reality is, we don’t like Putin’s tactics but Russia is the largest land mass with 145+ million people and a lot of oil reserves... if he (@realDonaldTrump) keeps acting tough, we’ll forgive some of his comments”.

3105 2018-07-22 16:20:28 During the Bush administration I was so upset at the direction the country was going, especially with regard to oil economy. My family decided to control what we could. We decided to live as low impact on the planet as possible. We continue to do what we can in small ways.....
3106 2018-07-22 16:20:17 As part of a scheme, Lamar Smith decides not to tell Kellyanne Conway that oil executives are disciples of Cthulhu. The butler abandons ship.
3107 2018-07-22 16:20:16 She's a life coach  only in her mind because  I no for a fact her putting peppermint oil around the eyes for headaches is a no no I use essential  oils all the time I know how to use them have for years and I'm 60 yr old.
3108 2018-07-22 16:20:10 Sounds gorgeous  - mine is bacon wrapped roast chicken with fresh roasted veg and mushrooms in oil garlic and balsamic to be oven roasted - cheated with shop bought roast spuds in duck fat and a ready made stuffing -fingers crossed
3109 2018-07-22 16:20:10 I just don't know why after 44 yrs of Conservative Gov't, anyone would want that back.  Just telling you now that the Carbon Tax will not go away (just like the GST has never gone away).  Maybe a name change to PST.  When oil was $130 a barrel - what happened to all that revenue.

3111 2018-07-22 16:19:51 Distribution of Algorithm and Swing Trading Reports scheduled to start after futures open (to allow for chart data to reset). Order: OIL, GOLD, SPY, SWING, CRYPTO, SILVER, VOLATILITY, DXY. Reporting duration: 3 overnight sessions (Sun, Mon, Tues).
3112 2018-07-22 16:19:50 A lot of the 'Yes' vote was based on the lies of the Salmond campaign, promises of walking into EU; pensions; fiscal settlement; oil and a myriad of other things both in and outside of the 'white paper'. Criminal charges should have been brought against him.
3113 2018-07-22 16:19:42 If corn oil comes from corn, where does baby oil come from?

3116 2018-07-22 16:19:24 I dislike them considerably. Wiggling against you, I smirk as you settle back, your hands stroking up my thighs as my own hands slowly rub oil over your chest and shoulders, then down your arms* What's the deal with El Capitan? Does he stay here all night too or does he go >>
3117 2018-07-22 16:19:14 Florida Governor Scott made a deal with Rump to help him win Sen seat. Scott met with President Rump’s adm & struck a deal to remove Fla from a list of states for more offshore oil drilling. He has yuge ties to big oil & loves fracking so this is for show to steal seat from Dem
3118 2018-07-22 16:19:10 Key terms in the Trump-Russia quid pro quo:

* sanctions relief
* Russian oil/LNG
* kompromat
* Trump Tower Moscow
* "collusion in plain sight"
* secret backchannels
* Russian active measures
* aiding/abetting
* the "Mayflower Speech"
* Trump's bizarre "NatSec advisory committee"
3119 2018-07-22 16:19:01 Lol ye scousers have been talking shit for years about utd spending and we generate our own money, no oil money needed so why all the hate all those years? But hey now it's cool right cause ye are doing it! Hypocrisy must run high in liverpool
3120 2018-07-22 16:19:00 ダイエットしていたって、時にはオイルも必要だろう?
3121 2018-07-22 16:18:56 I think I’m prob combo more on the dry side. Foaming cleansers sometimes make my skin feel tight but cream cleansers feel like they do nothing. I do like so double cleanse with oil to take off makeup tho.
3122 2018-07-22 16:18:55 It's a good thing they got out.
With tRump ceding US controlled territory to the Russians(think oil) the place is about to turn into a tornado of a shitstorm.
3123 2018-07-22 16:18:45 my sister used my thc infused coconut oil on her face and hair and BIIIITCH that shit was expensive im so mad
3124 2018-07-22 16:18:44 But Corn Oil and Sunflower Oil are the cheapest ones and relatively easy to find. They’re both great oils and will help make her shiny too. You feed about 1 cup/day but build her gradually over a week or so. Start with 1/4 cup, then 1/2 then a whole cup.
3125 2018-07-22 16:18:30 I really think Cold Chisel are victims of a certain kind of musical snobbery in this country... they are nowhere near as highly regarded by musicians as they should be. One of Australia's greatest rock groups, on a par with Midnight Oil at their peak
3126 2018-07-22 16:18:29 A nice bath, lavender oil flowing and 
3127 2018-07-22 16:18:28 Getting my oil changed tmw. Y’all pray I don’t get no extra news along w it

3129 2018-07-22 16:18:16 I don’t even put oil, I just put it in a pan for a couple minutes til it’s crispy haha
3130 2018-07-22 16:18:06 Q falso suenas. Muy elocuente ahora pero mudo sobre los negociados de PPK con Hunt Oil y Odebrecht. Mudo sobre las coimas a Villaran, Humala y Nadine. Mudo sobre la coima de USD 30 millones de Toledo. Mudo sobre los S/. 1,000 millones pagados a los medios EC, RPP, Latina, ATV, LR
3131 2018-07-22 16:18:04 We are about 20‰smaller than Engerland. We however have the oil in considerably larger maritime area

3133 2018-07-22 16:17:56 Tough to look back on this time when they're fighting for survival after peak oil or living in climate refugee camps. Maybe they can share the ancient talking artifact.. if they can figure out how to charge it.
3134 2018-07-22 16:17:52 The men go to majalisi a lot,some have classes after isha in mosque,and some weekends.
3135 2018-07-22 16:17:51 I always thought that the oil from your cooking had to go in the bin, but if it solidifies it can be put into a birdhouse as bird food, one mans junk is another's dinner #KeepitClear
3136 2018-07-22 16:17:45 You're the reason I tossed my krill oil supplement out in January...didn't even bother finishing the container
3137 2018-07-22 16:17:32 These types of tweets sure do bring out the hate inside of pro-pipeline folks.  Amusing to see people wishing harm upon those with opposing views. Are we so entrenched in an oil economy that we’re willing to fill our hearts with hate towards our neighbors for the sake of oil?
3138 2018-07-22 16:17:31 He is leaking oil
3139 2018-07-22 16:17:31 Sitting in IHOP just now eating breakfast and what do I hear but Midnight Oil, “Beds are Burning”. It took me back to 1988 so hard that I immediately called my mom and insisted she take me shopping for a tux for prom.
3140 2018-07-22 16:17:30 It’s a long process but in the end Rice Bran with an oil top dressing. (Flaxseed oil is the best IMO, it’s high in Omega 3 fatty acids- anti-inflammatory and balanced enough in Omega 6 fatty acids- pro-inflammatory that is doesn’t cause issues in older horses with arthritis.)
3141 2018-07-22 16:17:17 I always remember Biden's son signing a deal in Ukraine oil/gas the day after the earlier pro USA government went into power.
3142 2018-07-22 16:17:15 The importance of eating saturated fat without the guilt needs to be evangelised more and more! I am giving my best to contribute to this mission. Imagine, a Greek who claims that butter and especially Goat butter is a better choice than just using Olive oil every day ;)
3143 2018-07-22 16:17:03 Just look at the subcommittees the Senators who went to visit Russia during July 4th week are on...Energy, Commerce, Rural land development, mining (land and seabed), commodities, gas/oil pipelines, etc.
3144 2018-07-22 16:16:59 The solutions to any problem

Is maintenance.
Simple

Change ur oil or change ur motor later
Change your brakes or crash someday

Live well(healthy choices) or be diseased

3146 2018-07-22 16:16:46 1/2 A cautionary tail folks! After serving the roasties for lunch, HB managed to drop the dish of sizzling hot oil in the middle of our small kitchen. Luckily, I’m not allowed out there when things are being carried.
3147 2018-07-22 16:16:34 Never knew KoBra's in Oil Milling, but they surely were in raising hell for mullahs, Hindu social reform,  Hindusthani freedom struggle, taking Indian flag beyond Attock,in Peshawar ,fighting Afghan Jihadis to keep India safe   kinds of business. Do not forget to say Thanks.
3148 2018-07-22 16:16:33

3150 2018-07-22 16:16:25 The Rev is a snake oil salesman. You don’t have a love for country, @MichaelCohen212 .  You’re now selling your soul to wolves in sheep’s clothing. The Rev as you call him and @MichaelAvenatti are just two such wolves.
3151 2018-07-22 16:16:23 If they had spent that money to convert the Burnaby oil terminal back into refinery instead, at least that would have provided long term jobs, made any spills easier to clean up, and solved YVR's fuel supply issues. But why do that when a stupid decision is easier to make
3152 2018-07-22 16:16:22 Lol..project lie and hope...what about the 350 million, brexit dividen, akl food from the EU will cost more and as the £ collapse anything that has travel has  cost more as oil is paid for in dolls. Food is 15% more expensive today an vefore brexit.t
3153 2018-07-22 16:16:11 Who doesn't love horses and dogs? I'm such a fan of the wild west, I adore these horse oil paintings by Lindsey Bittner Graham :)
3154 2018-07-22 16:15:59 LOL,,,it works like this
scotland is very resource rich
EU want access to Europes largest oil and gas fields
They have already said scots can keep UK`s seat at the table
we will have own currency when we decide to.
EU want scots in

3156 2018-07-22 16:15:57 The family business of Vice President Mike Pence, Kiel Bros Oil Co, went under in 2004. Almost a decade and a half later, the cost of cleaning up after their contaminated waste has exceeded $22 million and counting. @EcoWatch

3158 2018-07-22 16:15:26 @Flipkart 
Do you have a habit of making fool of your customers.
Ordered indulekha oil and got something different in original packet.
Very cleverly done. I think you have a habit of that...
3159 2018-07-22 16:15:14 My car is getting fixed today woo then I’m taking it to get an oil change and tires rotated
3160 2018-07-22 16:14:58 Coconut oil is a good natural saturated fat and if you use organic, unsalted butter you’re getting Omega 3’s plus vitamins by using just a smidge of it. You can also use MCT oil in place of coconut oil which is also very beneficial. If made correctly it’s not oily whatsoever.
3161 2018-07-22 16:14:44 lay yo head down on me baby, coconut oil on my grey tee, but its coo, you kno, cus its yoouu

3164 2018-07-22 16:14:23 Just a little rough spot in the road that ripped off the oil pan...
3165 2018-07-22 16:14:14 Old people have impaired memory, as well... I would rather not die from cancer, from using CBD oil, than the alternative.
3166 2018-07-22 16:14:14 Lmao my mama really say earl instead of oil
3167 2018-07-22 16:14:10 strange that we PRODUCE so much oil and gas here in Canada, but our price is so high.  :(  We do have free health care, but it all comes out of our taxes in one way or the other.  As far as being clean, yes, for such a huge city Toronto is very clean.  :)
3168 2018-07-22 16:13:59 Soz but I can't stand them! Olive oil yes , olives no 
3169 2018-07-22 16:13:54 Gasoline meet OIL

3171 2018-07-22 16:13:45 I learned it in first and second grade, but I was living in a small oil town in the Utah desert.
3172 2018-07-22 16:13:22 im sure the valvoline workers love it when i come by myself to get my oil changed because they know they can get me to buy anything if they tell me i need it, because i have no fucking clue what they’re talking about

3174 2018-07-22 16:12:58 Our government must represent Main Street not Wall Street. Must Big Pharma determine healthcare policy? Big Oil, energy policy? There are rational solutions. Our choices are not between corporate serfdom and Trump style authoritarianism. New Deal politics can win the day.
3175 2018-07-22 16:12:49 Looks amazing. Coconut oil I found is really good.

3181 2018-07-22 16:12:10 Interested to see how the #oil price performs in the next week or two after the volatility of the last few weeks. Would like to see sustained $80+ in the hope that financial approval for capital projects picks up. Lots of factors - #Trump, #Iran, #tariffs etc...
3182 2018-07-22 16:12:07 currency really,,,we will use whatever currency the world wants to buy our oil gas water leccy renewables etc etc in.
How will England pay its 2 trillion debt without 92% of scots oil and gas revenues?
The EU have stated scots can take UK seat at the table Eli,,they want scots in
3183 2018-07-22 16:11:58 All you brilliant “Let the free market decide!” folks fail to realize we subsidize the oil and gas industry FAR more than any environmental subsidies. If we “let the market decide” the Tar Sands would be abandoned.
3184 2018-07-22 16:11:37 Thank you I tried Vitamin E oil I feel like it doesn't work for me or the coconut oil..

3224 2018-07-22 16:07:42 Except for Bush/Cheney & the oil group...most Democratic Politicians don’t want Wars either & would work diplomatically to deescalate. US is not at brink of War with NK, Russia nor China...this is manufactured by Trump to drum up the idea that he has fixed something.
3225 2018-07-22 16:07:32 @brianstelter Thanks for not agreeing to distraction/suggestion to invite guests (like Kudlow) to discuss  economic trend$, unless such administration officials are also willing to address global economy, including Russia's past efforts to gain control of Alaskan oil sea$.

3233 2018-07-22 16:07:08 Coconut oil just doesn't work for me. I know some people love it, but it's not my lube. We use butchers block oil on our rope and I'm just not putting that directly on our bits :-)
3234 2018-07-22 16:07:06 Oil has been consistently selling for prices that are above the budget benchmark, why is the excess crude account not reflecting this fact?

3245 2018-07-22 16:05:46 So no pills are taken right. Strictly food?! Wait what are some of the healthy oils, olive oil?
3246 2018-07-22 16:05:31 You really don't understand hacking attacks do you? It's not just about emails, it's also about electricity, water supply, oil, infrastructure.
3247 2018-07-22 16:05:29 Federal sys of granting contracts, tax subsidies, corporate bailouts, privatization - i.e., your tax monies subsidize rich oil companies, farmers, defense manufacturers, etc.  Over last decade, alone, 0% interest rates enabled corps to profit without investing their own equity.
3248 2018-07-22 16:05:21 Monthly skin/makeup boxes are not only ways for me to have an unnecessarily large makeup collection but they are also convincing me to add 5 more steps to my daily skincare routine. 

And it’s fucking working. Drown me in rose oil and vitamin C moisturizers.

3255 2018-07-22 16:04:32 On my face I have tens of chemical burns from my acne cream; long gashes from my nails from when I sleep; deep red, irritated acne; and skin so dry it looks like I have layer of canola oil on my face NO MATTER WHAT I DO. I've tried EVERYTHING. I AM ASHAMED OF MY FACE.
3256 2018-07-22 16:04:27 It's a special funnel someone homemade for draining oil out of the front axle of tractors. It's usually a messy job because it's hard to get in the tight space to put something in there to catch the oil.
3257 2018-07-22 16:04:23 - the first day at the beach I got o sun burnt I could barely move (but I’m getting a nice tan )

3259 2018-07-22 16:03:57 I blanch them and dry them. Toss them in oil. Generously. Then switch on both heaters at high temperatures (200C). Few mins near top then few mins near bottom. Done :) key is to eat them immediately when they're hot and crisp :D
3260 2018-07-22 16:03:54 Rice Bran my friend. You don’t feed more than 2lbs/day so it lasts. Oils as a top dressing. Corn or Sunflower oil (NEVER Vegetable oil) can be bought at Walmart for $7/gallon. 

If ulcers are a possibility add some Aloe Vera juice and Alfalfa to the diet.

3267 2018-07-22 16:03:11 I'm applying tea tree oil on mosquito bites for relief and thought "what does that smell remind me of" I guess I got bit and used so much tea tree oil in naples last year that those things are going to be linked forever
3268 2018-07-22 16:03:07 Tea tree oil
3269 2018-07-22 16:03:06 Nerve pain is flaring up thanks to the weather...so what do I do first thing after getting home from work? Soaking my swollen, achy feet in warm water/epsom salts/rose oil. When did I turn 80 years old?! 
3270 2018-07-22 16:03:03 5 million harleys, environmental disaster... if you consider that each bike holds about 40 ounces of oil in it's primary, and will most likely lose all of it on the ride. That's a little over 1.5million gallons of oil left on American streets.
3271 2018-07-22 16:03:02 Lool oily skin is not even like that. Some people purposely put oil on their skin
3272 2018-07-22 16:02:33 Is there a difference among Bush, Obama, and Trump? All three use “Democracy” for regime change and all consistently cause disruption in countries where there’s oil or where countries seek to nationalize their oil.
3273 2018-07-22 16:02:23 But coconut oil is soooo good! I like jojoba too.
3274 2018-07-22 16:02:15 How many of you sneezing and have runny nose and are anywhere near rape seed oil fields. Bright yellow may look lovely but add the heat, pollution if you're in the M25 corridor =  #sneezing
3275 2018-07-22 16:02:07 Still gotta wash the car and change the oil lol
3276 2018-07-22 16:02:05 But tbh even if my bae is nice and gentle, he shouted really loudly one time when he was frying chicken bc the oil popped and hit him and I got so scared.. I almost dropped the chicken fillet I was coating jusko. My heart.
3277 2018-07-22 16:01:58 Yeah, but he's leaking oil, as we speak.
3278 2018-07-22 16:01:56 I don’t get it. Why does the baby need all that on their hair. I can understand a little oil so it’s not dry, but all that extra is ridiculous
3279 2018-07-22 16:01:35 If you feel like you chugged a galon of burning hot gravel mixed with motor oil and cocaine?
3280 2018-07-22 16:01:31 Yup, they never filled lots of senior positions cause Spanky wants to keep his thumb on the State Dept, they are NOT working for America anymore, they’re working to enrich DT AT ANY COST,Russian oil $$$ is calling to dirty Donnie #ImpeachKingOfEmoluments #ImpeachKingOfCorruption
3281 2018-07-22 16:01:29 And that is the short list. Ramp up on energy independence is huge without massive ramp up of oil production as well. These people rely on low information bubble dwellers to eat their lies up but forget that we voted for Trump despite their lies.
3282 2018-07-22 16:01:28 You do realize Americans work in the oil and gas industry ? Thenlist is huge with direct and indirect jobs associated There is definitely a benefit . Please educate yourself
3283 2018-07-22 16:01:27 Don’t stir it, mix it in a small blender, use coconut oil and kerrygold butter. If you halfassed of course it tasted like crap.
3284 2018-07-22 16:01:26 I love all the superstition involved in weddings

- Having something blue

- Groom not allowed to see the bride

- The most distinguished guest at the wedding is anointed in a thick oil and slid from table to table as a show of good faith

- Rings

3301 2018-07-22 15:59:04 Tiger has been leaking oil since the moment he took the lead. Let's see if he can settle himself.
3302 2018-07-22 15:59:03 I did, contacted my local BMW dealer directly, and they told me that they can't help me because I changed the oil myself, without checking my car in their facilty and leting them change it themselves.

They told me to come back next time to change the oil and reset the oil alarm.

3306 2018-07-22 15:58:07 My partner does the coconut oil/ butter in the coffee thing and I just can't  I'm all about the strong black coffee (or, occasionally, strong with a tiny, tiny, itty-bitty splash of a suggestion of heavy cream)
3307 2018-07-22 15:58:01 Baking soda and lemon juice/essential oil
3308 2018-07-22 15:57:54 Yes. The one I saw that nauseated me was on the back. You know how we have glands that secrete oil or sebum?  This one got blocked and created the back-up
3309 2018-07-22 15:57:46 I bought some oil today I think I might have won today's battle. 
3310 2018-07-22 15:57:38 oil hike increases due to unexplainable reason
3311 2018-07-22 15:57:36 I have a fucking 4 cylinder coupe and my car takes synthetic oil. Appreciate it if ur oil changes aren’t $70!!!!
3312 2018-07-22 15:57:33 Definitely leaking a little oil the last few holes. Bogey save is a must
3313 2018-07-22 15:57:30 Hey @amjoyshow Maxine Waters has it EXACTLY right. It’s all about the #sanctions & always has been. Big   $. Big oil. Big leverage. The stolen election IS what Putin has on Trump. It’s payback time & that is lifting the sanctions. It’s his #legitimacy, his biggest fear. #AMJoy
3314 2018-07-22 15:57:22 This baby is in so much pain. It's skin is so hard and it hurts to move or do anything. It's a skin condition called harlequin ichthyrosis

3323 2018-07-22 15:56:05 Not only did they attack our democracy, They also set out to dismantle American Renewable Energy While increasing interest in Coal and Oil. looking at graphs will show you the corruption in our own Stock market...Follow the money
3324 2018-07-22 15:56:03 We now expect to see an ever growing pile of lawsuits against oil companies. #ActOnClimate
3325 2018-07-22 15:55:59 Then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth deals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil.

KJV. Numbers 15:9
3326 2018-07-22 15:55:47 I always thought that oddly peculiar. First thing he does is hide something. And that was a harbinger of his regime, wasn’t it? Slight of hand. Sneaky under the table deals from the smug narcissistic snake oil salesman.
3327 2018-07-22 15:55:43 Things I Googled today: best laptop bags; why fish oil?; green smoothie; green smoothie joe rogan; why joe rogan?
3328 2018-07-22 15:55:35 He was a victim of his delusions of grandeur. He wanted to be called king of kings of Africa. He wanted to do a lot for africans while imprisoning and killing them on his soil. Weird no? What does Libya export or produce? Nothing. Why? Bc that idiot used oil to buys his people.

He seems extremely professional, discreet and really nice. >>

3333 2018-07-22 15:55:11 Fair comment. How do we generate the investment as independent nations?  I genuinely don’t know. They talk about North Sea oil in Scotland, but turned out to be incorrect.

3337 2018-07-22 15:54:45 Thorium needs to get on deck for a very clean energy source. And fast. We are crawling out of hydrocarbon and just need a little tap to get clear. That will cause a global shift geopolitical. No more oil wars for generations..

3347 2018-07-21 23:59:08 I'm livid. My car is 2,000 miles from its next oil change and every fluid is below the minimum or, in the case of the oil and coolant, completely empty.

3354 2018-07-21 23:57:36 Agreed when it comes to the controlled breathing, also a few months ago i found CBD oil to be helpful if i knew i was going to be in a stressful environment, it brought the edge off of my anxiety without making me feel weird or out of it mentally
3355 2018-07-21 23:57:29 Ya and what so ironic is. Most BC guys go work in Alberta or over seas or where every they can find a job then come back to bc for a week or so. BC doesn’t want any of their land disturbed. To dump to know other prov s reclaim their oil lands to beautiful parks
3356 2018-07-21 23:57:26 Finished selling out pristine Alaskan lands to oil companies and the Alaskan people to poverty and sickness?
3357 2018-07-21 23:57:17 Tell that to Elon Musk he’s basically bankrupt, trying to build electric vehicles. The ICE is way more efficient then what they used to be . Oil still drives the Canadian economy.
3358 2018-07-21 23:57:04 trump wants to build hotel and golf courses and get to the oil in Russia. No other country will let him borrow money. So he willing to do whatever, he won't disclose his taxes because he is broke and now We the American people have to suffer.
3359 2018-07-21 23:56:57 I dug into multiple oil spill spots today. The smell is horrendous & it messed with me all day.

3382 2018-07-21 23:55:26 Right -- DECADES ago.  Ergo, the defunct status of the Trusteeship Council.  And how horrible that we *buy* their oil from them, gasp!!  Africa faced challenges no doubt, but once they move beyond voting in strongman/despot type leaders they'll come around.
3383 2018-07-21 23:55:02 When communist entities were sold off to what became oligarchs at millicents on the dollar. Mines, aircraft companies, oil, gas, the works
3384 2018-07-21 23:54:37 Oil free make up wipes!
3385 2018-07-21 23:54:33 Another problem is that the oil crisis was external. People had no choice but to grin and bear it. A carbon tax is government applied, and people can change that with their vote. We have to convince people to vote against their immediate self-interest.
3386 2018-07-21 23:54:25 Clinique's products are good - especially the Beyond Perfecting Foundation which absorbs excess oil.
3387 2018-07-21 23:54:13 They be having the oil capsules where you go? Or you know where to get them?
3388 2018-07-21 23:54:04 I love coconut oil hair masks so bloody much
3389 2018-07-21 23:53:57 A bilateral trade deal maybe? So it’s gonna be cheap Wodka and ... ahhhmm ... oil, gas? naa - no need, so ... cheap Wodka then - and of course - a new TrumPutin tower in Moscow

3405 2018-07-21 23:50:08 If Apple made a car, they'd probably make the engine sealed, so when you need an oil change, you have to buy a new car.

3417 2018-07-21 23:48:23 It also explains, as the political party which represents the American fossil fuel industry, why Republicans protect Trump's treasonous relationship with Putin--the oil industry they represent shares Putin's economic need to maintain fossil fuel energy dependancy.
3418 2018-07-21 23:48:20 At what point did my family go from being science based (but religious) to quacky snake oil don’t-trust-science BS? Are they anti vaccine now too? Do I want to ask them? 
3419 2018-07-21 23:48:19 I agree, I’m an aboriginal guy myself but I identify myself first and foremost as a Canadian. I’m an Oil Patch brat and I’m extremely proud of what Alberta has accomplished and I’m old enough to remember growing up in a Have Not Alberta.
3420 2018-07-21 23:47:57 It's so easy to replace the bad oils! I replaced canola oil with avocado oil (high heat), vegetable oil with olive oil, and I still use sesame oil in Asian cuisine. They are my new "regulars."

3427 2018-07-21 23:47:16 Thank you, internet, for telling me that I can tell my olive oil is warm enough on the stove by clicking some water on it, but NOT telling me that if I do that, it will spray boiling oil all over me. 
3428 2018-07-21 23:47:09 But why does your new house have so many spiders??????  And oh!  I dunno if you'd be open to trying it but peppermint essential oil really helps deter bugs from my room usually.

3433 2018-07-21 23:46:04 Where I live, the economy is very dependent on oil and gas. The key is to begin diversifying now so there can be an economically viable transition to alternative energy. It is irresponsible for anyone to bury their head in the sand and fight this transition.
3434 2018-07-21 23:45:54 Today’s lunch/dinner I’ve replaced Olive oil with Henny.
3435 2018-07-21 23:45:54 @TiresPlus One of your technicians didn’t replace my oil cap yesterday. This is a HUGE problem. Oil all over my engine. Untold damage.
3436 2018-07-21 23:45:16 CBD is Hemp (cannabis) oil (the good one not to be confused with THC, the stuff that gets you high) 
According US law I can't say CBD will fix it, but it will help your body go for a complete mental balance
3437 2018-07-21 23:45:01 They back out, their loss. The consequence of doing so: the fall of Assad; cracking down on Hezbollah's international drug dealing; shutting down Iran's oil exports 100%.
3438 2018-07-21 23:44:56 It seems like everything involving Trump,  NRA , GOP or the right-wing evangelicals has been corrupted. If not by Russia then by the oligarchs like the Mercers and Koch bros. or big oil and gas industry.

3445 2018-07-21 23:43:38 Yep!! Massage some of your favorite oil in your scalp after you got them down and let the steam (not the water) hit your scalp while you’re in the shower. Braid the braids into a loose, low jumbo braids and wrap a scarf around your edges.
3446 2018-07-21 23:43:36 "Spotcheck Billy down on his hands and knees, says hey mama hey, let me check your oil alright? She say 'no, no honey not tonight"
3447 2018-07-21 23:43:14 the oil to prevent reflection..
3448 2018-07-21 23:43:10 TIMES when you wish for a squirt bottle FULL OF CASTOR OIL!  
3449 2018-07-21 23:43:01 Feed my ducks with oil? Are you stupid?? #koulzbot
3450 2018-07-21 23:42:54 When my skin is dry I use rosehip or vitamin e oil. Then this moisturizer from Pacifica. And retinols occasionally but I haven’t noticed them making a huge difference. I really just need to find a great cleanser.
3451 2018-07-21 23:42:45 This is fake. It gots to be CG. Who moves fast like that and who survives at a boiling heated oil? Once a worm touches a boiling oil it’s dead within a second unless this Popeye chicken are selling 2 weeks old chicken!

3453 2018-07-21 23:42:27 The US will be far less beautiful when Trump's done with it. The big mining, oil & gas industries will be far,far richer. And the American people will be far poorer. Trump's ego,his malignant narcissistic ego, is the ruin of our country-- if we give up. #DoNotEverGiveUp
3454 2018-07-21 23:41:59 I picked up 3 super cheap garage sale oil paintings and I am going to add (paint in) a #dnd monster in to each. The question I put to you all is which monsters in which paintings? #pathfinder #pnprpg #rpg #help please share, like, tell a friend and help me pick!
3455 2018-07-21 23:41:39 What treason?  He's selling arms to Ukraine, taking out Russian assets in Syria, imposing sanctions, asking Germany to stop buying Russian oil and gas etc.  Stop spreading anti American propaganda.
3456 2018-07-21 23:41:35 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
3457 2018-07-21 23:41:27 Maybe your article presents a comprehensive analysis of the developing oil industry in my country, but it is fraught with negative exaggerations and distortions that have only made your piece distasteful. This narrative you are peddling is an ugly, first world stereotype.
3458 2018-07-21 23:41:12 Ohh I recently started using Thayer’s too! And I have those problems also. I think glycolic toner helps with some of the hyperpigmentation and redness but idk for sure. I use caudalie vino perfect serum every night which has made a huge difference. Tea tree oil since I’m oily rn
3459 2018-07-21 23:40:25 And baby oil
3460 2018-07-21 23:40:17 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
3461 2018-07-21 23:40:07 I been on this oil lately. Is like ion know me lately
3462 2018-07-21 23:39:53 They’re called facts Whitney. It’s science. And birth control is not, say, chemotherapy. Which is poison, but also necessary to beat cancer. Should we essential oil ourselves to health instead?
3463 2018-07-21 23:39:48 The bad news is that this isn’t the story.  FBI did not leak it, the trump team did. Privileged info; client-attorney privilege. Plan is to use it as evidence of “deep state” effort to unseat djt.  The REAL story is major economic shifts occurring that involve Russia/oil.
3464 2018-07-21 23:39:42 Spain will be the most important nation all over the world cause we have a treasure! Our Spanish pure olive oil, and you eating horrible hamburger meanwhile, that nasty butter oil that becomes you fat and more fat,so think it over and low the taxes for Spanish oil or all fat !
3465 2018-07-21 23:39:33 Hair products are fake news! Just discovered that 15-W30 motor oil has superior stay and shine.
3466 2018-07-21 23:39:16 Coconut oil be doing my hair justice.
3467 2018-07-21 23:39:12 Roger that. The SCS is a hot spot contested by several nations due to likely oil and gas deposits. And the Chinese are fortifying the islands with a TON of military infrastructure.
3468 2018-07-21 23:38:51 So that's all you are in Somalia your a small location and nation that will provide services to the muslim brotherhood around the red sea so they can use the transportation link of saudi oil through threats and Turkey has a base now in mogadishu to ensure it's weapons can dock
3469 2018-07-21 23:38:40 Oh fuck I just poured a container of veg oil down the drain I thought it was jello that'd been sitting for a long time
3470 2018-07-21 23:38:07 “It’s really interesting how flavors can be added— Oh, but the coolest part is how flavors taste differently with everything they touch! Strawberry soda is really unique from strawberry lemonade.”
3471 2018-07-21 23:38:04 I really like "fat bombs"--it's a keto thing (which I don't do) with real value. My favorite is 1/4 c of almond butter or peanut butter + 1/4 c cocount oil + 2T cocoa powder. I like it as is, but you could add a liquid sweetener. Pour it in silicon molds (candy or cupcake), chill

3473 2018-07-21 23:37:30 Look at all the money oil companies are taking from your families. A carbon tax is trivial next to oil industry highway robbery!
3474 2018-07-21 23:37:29 Right, I know this one, I did this with leftover chips by the campfire: half a bulb of garlic chopped, mix with juice of half a lemon, salt, pepper, marg spread and a bit of oil. Into a frying pan along with said chips. Done.

3476 2018-07-21 23:37:08 Ocasio -Cortez wants YOU MILLENIALS AND YOUR KIDS to pay for free college/trade school,healthcare. Think retirees can pay? Let’s get Iraw and Kuwait to pay in oil- reparations for cost of pulling their bacon out of the fire!  We spent blood and 6 trillion in cash- where is the UN
3477 2018-07-21 23:36:23 I don't watch any sport where players protest anymore. #NBA College High School Little league, whatever. Protest/politics and sports are like oil and water, they just don't mix.
3478 2018-07-21 23:36:21 The oil and gas magnates have them whipped up about going along wi whatever, so the rich allow them to
believe they are going to get to a world w-o brown persons, and help them acheive it!
3479 2018-07-21 23:35:52 Must be some “sweet” oil.

3481 2018-07-21 23:35:22 The people of the south are the ones who freed mosul and are feeding it through their oil and you guys show no gratitude.
3482 2018-07-21 23:35:22 If anyone thinks I’m going anywhere in this heat you’re smoking vegetable oil lol
3483 2018-07-21 23:34:47 It’s called strategic thinking we sacrificed many life’s to protect the oil. The same oil Japan attacked up for in ww2. Controlling the world resources is what great powers do.  So let’s Waite for China to be on our door steps like Mexico or Canada to do something read a book plz
3484 2018-07-21 23:34:46 throughout the day if your skin gets too oily you can dab it with rice paper (from Sally’s) or even a toilet seat cover from a gas station and it will absorb the oil from your skin
3485 2018-07-21 23:34:46 Today I Learned: diesel engines can fail in a way that leaves them burning engine oil and accelerating. Fuel cutoff/ignition doesn't stop it. Need to pop it into neutral to stop it overpowering brakes.

3488 2018-07-21 23:34:08 I vividly remember the shift to economy vehicles after the 70s oil crisis. What would be the equivalent tax amount then? 2% seems like a low result, though it may take 5 years to get a 50% shift to a 30% more efficient vehicle, so 3% per year?
3489 2018-07-21 23:34:05 Without rechecking, that is literally just the suit he was wearing at the time the explosion went off to result in the burns happening. Unlike the comics, he isn't doused by acid on his hands and face. His entire left side catches on fire from having been doused in oil previously
3490 2018-07-21 23:34:04 That's how it went. I was very hungry. Fish oil is good for the depression. That's how I justify eating a huge plate of it

3494 2018-07-21 23:33:33 There is no benefit for the US.  There is for Trump and some of his billionaire friends.  Oil is a big reason.  But there's much more

3498 2018-07-21 23:32:37 Don't bother with creams, they're basically snake oil. Coconut oil and vitamin E oil will be your best friend! Let the vitamin E soak in, then coconut oil. 
3499 2018-07-21 23:32:33 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.

3501 2018-07-21 23:32:08 I replied to a tweet with a link about green sector jobs employing more people than oil. I know a lot of people who work in AB and are constantly out of work. We need safe, permanent jobs.

3504 2018-07-21 23:31:29 Hard boiled? Not after that dame was through with him. It was one of those nights that rained motor oil, hot and dark. The kind of night best spent with an old friend like whiskey or rum, not some two-bit broad from Fifth Street. But there she was. He knew it wouldnt end well.
3505 2018-07-21 23:31:21 This is funny. The steel tariffs went into effect Jun 1st and the month of June saw the highest ever production of US oil & NG with the strongest demand for the products seen since 2007. Yet the experts can't see the link between the two and instead call for ending the tariff. 
3506 2018-07-21 23:31:16 No regrets voting for @OntarioGreens this past election. I'm excited to see @MikeSchreiner lead by example, and spark a Green wave no oil lobby can stop.
3507 2018-07-21 23:30:56 It’s like scheduling/paying for an oil change for ur car & showing up only for them to say “I know u booked but we gave ur oil to someone else who didn’t plan ahead & since we already have ur money u can either try again or take a loss” (having already lost your time)

3517 2018-07-21 23:29:46 *so* easy - tail-on shrimp, tossed in a big bowl with some olive oil and whatever seasoning you want. Tonight was bbq, sometimes we use fajita seasoning, could be lemon pepper. Grill and you're good.
3518 2018-07-21 23:29:44 His boss Putin ordered him to give ANOTHER $200M in military aid to Ukraine to hide the fact Trump  works for him. Next, as in the past, we’ll sink Russia through Gas, Oil, and Sanctions, all ordered by Putin. Great to have a masochist as a boss! #MAGA
3519 2018-07-21 23:29:41 I'll rub a  large potato with olive oil, minced garlic and chopped Rosemary.  cover in Al foil and bake.  makes a really yummy baked potato... but I do love rosemary and some people don't
3520 2018-07-21 23:29:34 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
3521 2018-07-21 23:29:33 Coconut oil will high key make your hair magical AF. Just so you know.
3522 2018-07-21 23:29:21 You’ve never been quite. You have Trump bashed from the start. People don’t give a damn what you think or say. Not  even a squeaky wheel no oil for you.

3555 2018-07-21 23:22:58 Obama left a ton of unused leverage on the table to extract concessions. He could've threatened to help oust Assad, for example. Or unilaterally imposed sanctions on Iran's  oil exports (as Trump is doing now).

Pretty soon, no sanctions whatsoever and Putin will have 1/3 of America soil as well.  Perhaps Guam or Marshall Islands

3591 2018-07-21 23:18:54 My bad - going at dinner time & expecting that maybe the most popular item would be fully stocked.  So I went to @GardenFoodsMkt bought chicken fillets drenched them in oil and seasoning and grilled them.   Did I mention I hate Zehrs? So much disappointment...

3594 2018-07-21 23:18:46 Apparently @jiffylubecares doesn’t care. They changed oil on @melodyguy1 van, a single mother and working musician, and forgot to put new oil in it and it ruined her motor. #jiffylube won’t fix it!  Horrible people. #ripoff #musician #workingmom #chevy #ford #vanlife #dodge
3595 2018-07-21 23:18:43 All she needed was some WATER and some natural oil! and her hair would have been set
3596 2018-07-21 23:18:09 And this is the rub of it. We knew for decades this was coming but we let oil companies continue to rape the land and leave behind billions of dollars worth of cleanup on well sites, instead of mandating tech development when we should have.

3602 2018-07-21 23:17:03 Ahhhhhh again deflections. I already answered that question. Again you only care to look good until I present you how veganism is not really "100% cruelty free". I don't care if you're vegan, I care that youre attempting to sell me snake oil as the cure for everything. 
3603 2018-07-21 23:16:55 You guys are adorable!
3604 2018-07-21 23:16:47 Sigh. Plastics come from petroleum sources.  Aka oil and gas. While in the future car may run on electricity,  we will still need petroleum products for plastics.  Not for grocery bags but for anything else that is plastic.
3605 2018-07-21 23:16:46 For true democracy we need a system that makes corporations accountable to the people. Doesn't matter if it's BP oil, or Disney. CEOs only care about shareholders, we need a better system. #PowerToThePeople

3639 2018-07-21 23:11:48 Sunday Riley's UFO oil (the green shit, smells like oregano or something). Wicked expensive, but you can legit just stop by Sephora for a sample every month. Or that milky piggy bubble mask #holygrail
3640 2018-07-21 23:11:45 Roasted Brussels sprouts are phenomenal!  Wash,  cut it half,  rub with oil of your choice,  sprinlle with sea salt, (and/or spices of your choice) and bake until they are brown.  The leaves become crunchy,  salty deliciousness!

3644 2018-07-21 23:11:04 There are olives grown here. Lots of them, but because of our population, I might look like nothing on this scale. There are several olive oil making companies here, some very close to me. And they have lots of trees. I’ve seen some.

3666 2018-07-21 23:06:31 Do all these indictments go back to Ukraine?
Sure seems that way. A TON of illegal crap went down (overthrowing the gov and taking over big gas/oil) under Obama/Biden/Clinton and Kerry. 
Podesta group, manafort, gates, page are all involved (accused) too.
3667 2018-07-21 23:06:29 Bottom line is he met with Putin in private, invited him to visit the WH. He is also strangling Russia with oil and gas US production. We need Russia as an ally, but we have to be able to offer something. It’s called leverage.

3739 2018-07-21 22:52:51 Kim was trying to figure out how she could possibly prepare in time for a Gatwood Oil or Mesa Verde meeting & still manage to eat and sleep. Then it dawns on her that this same mentality is what got her in a car wreck just days ago. That’s it.
3740 2018-07-21 22:52:47 Connecting with nature & Frankincense essential oil. (I recently did a podcast about how Frank helps ease anxiety) But also like - trees and fresh air are so helpful 
3741 2018-07-21 22:52:20 I wish I never put coconut oil on my face. I found that out a lil too late
3742 2018-07-21 22:52:07 Recipe : 6-8 Red/Yellow Habaneros like Level 10 (Mexico) u can buy it in every wholesale but u need to dry it for 7-10 days in Dry Room without humidity. Then u purée that with rape oil and heat them up in Microwave or oven (not in a pot or Pan) when done Cool down in fridge 20 h

3746 2018-07-21 22:51:37 This comes as no surprise. Trudeau's government has been ever so stupid to allow significant investment in a number of Canadian companies (oil& gas, IT, security developers ....) China is working towards controlling us through these firms.

They're charlatans, modern day snake oil salesman, selling pre-packaged bigotry and hate.

3762 2018-07-21 22:47:36 That’s basically exactly what I do the ‘I won’t get changed, I’ll be careful’ thing. Then get paint/beach/oil all over whatever it is I’m wearing. I’ve even ruined my pyjamas.
3763 2018-07-21 22:47:27 Thus far he is agreeing to leave alone international investment in Pemex oil fields through PMI, but we shall see. If memory serves, the little Venezuelan did the same thing before sequestering all assets.
3764 2018-07-21 22:47:23 Real talk? I just wanna be able to afford a doctor. And get comfortable habitats for my animal pals. And decorate my modest 1BR apartment. And keep the fridge decently stocked. And get my car's oil changed on time. I don't need fancy, I just want to survive.

3767 2018-07-21 22:47:07 This is a policy management case, meaning that the court just doesn’t want this “loophole” against IPR’s to exist. So, just like Oil States, precedent, logic, etc will just be wrapped around whatever result the court wants.
3768 2018-07-21 22:47:05 Thanks so much for the tip! I’m constantly buying those little blue oil sheets! Love your tips!

3770 2018-07-21 22:47:02 No perhaps about it. People aren't perfect, so anyone selling a perfect way to live is selling snake oil. What makes one person's life joyous is going to be someone else's vision of hell.

Extremes of any system, whether libertarian or communist, have tended to be mostly dreadful
3771 2018-07-21 22:46:29 Well stop using palm oil and put creme eggs back to the old recipe would be nice as well. As for sugar why not use Stevia, a natural plant and tastes no different to sugar and can be used in baking etc and far better for you than chemical sweeteners as well.
3772 2018-07-21 22:46:13 And not before time. Oil is enough of a stranglehold on the world, without the dollar as well.

3778 2018-07-21 22:45:39 Ive seen it at the grocery store next to regular coconut oil. Never buy it tho. Have to question what they add to it to make it stay liquid.
3779 2018-07-21 22:45:38 Check your Engine oil this afternoon.
3780 2018-07-21 22:45:37 For the past 3-yrs, banks have been holding back calling the loans/lines of credit form numerous smaller oil companies - realizing the value is greater waiting out the storm than taking possession. Banks are now forcing action. More bloodshed to follow..
3781 2018-07-21 22:45:30 So, is Donald Trump intentionally working to inflate oil prices in order to enrich all of his little friends? Is that how these little games work? #RESIST #TrumpIsNotAmerica #TrumpIsATraitor

3785 2018-07-21 22:45:04 ...for the same reasons why @ToyotaMotorCorp @Honda & @Hyundai don’t offer on-board electrolyzers or home refuelers: big oil and the the govts that protect them would have to get uglier then they already are. The petro dollar is driving the demise of the sheep!! Wake up!
3786 2018-07-21 22:44:28 I completely melted a Lush serum bar that was inside my bag outside today. My coconut oil completely turned to liquid too so I think it was toasty out. Whoopsie!!
3787 2018-07-21 22:44:25 So True! Money buys us lawyers and oil changers and plumbers. we do not all have the same number of hands to use in our 24 hours.

3789 2018-07-21 22:43:41 We should be imposing a loss of revenue tax on the oil and gas B.C. consumes and taxing all B.C. products until we have full access to export markets.  We could be using $5-10 million a day of that $100 million revenue lost to make our energy transport safer and more efficient

3803 2018-07-21 22:40:58 @michellevisage I was wondering how is you dad? I found that avocado seed’s oil is really good for arthritis! Actually it worked with my grandad, he uses the oil as if it were a cream and his pain knees decreased!
3804 2018-07-21 22:40:58 I used to be a smoker, but stopped 4 years ago. Now I am using orange oil and kombucha to detox. There aparently was tar in my brain which is now being cleaned. Smoking is grosser than gross.
3805 2018-07-21 22:40:52 Yum this sounds very tasty.  I may have to add some capers and maybe black garlic instead of regular garlic, maybe a touch of truffle oil.
3806 2018-07-21 22:40:49 So? What do you want to imply. Do you still want that 20% from the production sales regardless of how much profit oil producer can make? Or you actually frustrated that definition of royalty from Mahathir is incorrect?

3816 2018-07-21 22:38:53 Big oil.
3817 2018-07-21 22:38:52 Oil is also steam, But oil conversion is by no means a guaranteed success, The cog  railway ruined an historical steam engine trying the conversion. It is  an expense and difficult process. And no, in stage two, steam should not  be suspended,

3826 2018-07-21 22:36:48 Jimmy Carter was president during oil shortages he tried to warn everyone back then about dependence on oil. Actually had solar water installed in white house till Reagan came in and took down went back to old wasteful habits. If we had only listened then.

3846 2018-07-21 22:33:37 “Eventually” can take a long time if you leave nature to do it on its own. But put China and Russia on top with jackhammers and “eventually” will happen a lot sooner. They’ve already passed the point of no return. The USD is being actively replaced in trade & oil.
3847 2018-07-21 22:33:05 CIA killed Kennedy.....George Bush (41) was a CIA operative in Texas at the time....Zapata Oil.  Later becomes CIA director.  Deep State on both sides of the aisle...Dems and Republicans
3848 2018-07-21 22:33:01 Yeah  Gaddafi tried that when my dad was running desert oil bases All the foreign workers exited and he got stupid and "died". So that's not a good model I'd duplicate. Total fail.
3849 2018-07-21 22:32:36 There is a technique (I think maybe for gyoza specifically?) where you put both water and oil in with your dumplings and keep the dumplings moving. The water evaporates off and you're left with the oil, which fries the dumplings. I'll see if I can find it when I'm home
3850 2018-07-21 22:32:36 Not exactly correct, they’ve rolled back numerous environmental regulations on clean air and water, opened national parks and shores to oil exploration, made it easier to hide campaign contributions, several ACA rollbacks raising uninsured rate...,.

3856 2018-07-21 22:31:08 I’m talking about how big pharma hid the medicinal benefits of cannabis oil & smoking or ingesting pot. BTW cannabis oil is superior to petroleum oil when used in plastics. ALL hidden to protect big pharma & big oil interests.

Quite the business plan; pollute with impunity, go bankrupt because clean up is big $, leave it for taxpayers to pay for.
3878 2018-07-21 22:26:39 @Nestle are you using 100% sustainable palm oil yet? I'm tired of boycotting I just want Nutella but what I want more is to give endangered orangutans their homes back.

3881 2018-07-21 22:26:09 This is a dumb metric for me. Capacity is increasing, because costs are coming down. Comparing to fossils is weird too, because the oil mobs are all investing so much in exploration at the moment.
3882 2018-07-21 22:25:47 Like some people are asking, are we already Russian?  Republicans might finally get upset when Putin invades Alaska and takes the oil.  I doubt Canada will want to come to our defense then.

3886 2018-07-21 22:25:30 Dólar Today is an agent for drugs and oil! Marijuana is its main business!
3887 2018-07-21 22:25:29 beard oil brands are for those toxic broflakes who use the phrase "like a sir" and drink craft beer exclusively, 
miss me with that classist bullshit
3888 2018-07-21 22:25:26 Hi Monarch, do you mean that you can’t eat gluten because you have celiac? That’s everyone with celiac. Also, it’s not the oil that we’re talking about. The French fry ingredients themselves contain gluten - the beef flavor.
3889 2018-07-21 22:25:21 Young Living’s Mirah Lustrous Hair Oil sure is amazing! *

* Results not possible, this stuff is good, but not this good. It does make my hair feel incredible! 
3890 2018-07-21 22:25:09 i love coconut oil, helps grow my lashes too
3891 2018-07-21 22:24:49 Sort of reminds me of the X-Files, much of which was shot in Vancouver BC though they were clearly "FBI." Would anyone have watched if Mulder and Scully were, like, RCMP officers? Maybe the black oil would have been maple syrup.
3892 2018-07-21 22:24:43 They do have an Empress or Lady grey i think, but I don't like it much, too weak.. I'm a bit addicted to their precise level of whatsit oil. YOu know what I mean.
3893 2018-07-21 22:24:37 castor oil does it work?
3894 2018-07-21 22:24:28 I so want to rub coconut oil alllllllllll over your body 
3895 2018-07-21 22:24:27 Twelve Mile Limit, Cement Mixer, Bloody Brain, French 75, Pineapple Upside Down Cake,Irish Car Bomb, Motor Oil
borde räcka, för kvällen med drinktips nu  ;-)
3896 2018-07-21 22:24:07 Cut up some home-grown cherry tomatoes with S/P and olive oil with your pesto. Oh my!
3897 2018-07-21 22:24:02 What are the odds NYT's Board of Directors include oil lobby reps?
3898 2018-07-21 22:24:02 I’ve given up on fancy expensive skincare too. My rosehip oil is excellent serum/ moisturiser and a £20 bottle lasts for months. Also, a bar of lovely L’Occitane soap is gorgeous with a shower puff thing and lasts forever.
3899 2018-07-21 22:23:57 Sorry, yes, like having to sign a paper to inherit the biggest bank or oil industry must be very difficult
3900 2018-07-21 22:23:53 Lol I had a killer salad the other day. Cut up some left over steak, spinach leaf, carrots, cucumber, tomatoes, red onion, garlic, added chia seeds, hemp seeds and olive oil then topped it with some sautéed mushrooms and mozzarella cheese. Sorta like philly cheese steak 
3901 2018-07-21 22:23:51 Yeah I received some vitamin E oil,Amazon is replacing it but told me I don't have to return this one. I don't feel comfortable using items without a seal. Many of my essential oils come with the safety twist off cap....I'm good if it's safety cap no seal..but it has to be one
3902 2018-07-21 22:23:42 Thinly sliced aubergine with drizzle of olive oil, vinegar and salt....oh, and bottle of white
3903 2018-07-21 22:23:31 I think I have a ceramic pan and it’s great but I still use oil on it 
3904 2018-07-21 22:23:29 You missed Zinke- opening our coast to oil and gas leases, giving Bear’s Ears touranium mining, and gutting the Endangered Species Act as his current move, all while enriching himself with Halliburton.  Swamp creature.
3905 2018-07-21 22:23:25 Most nights I wake up screaming “Oil Change!”
3906 2018-07-21 22:23:01 Monosodium Glutamate, Maltodextrin, modified GMO corn starch, potato flakes, GMO corn syrup, Sodium Diacetate, Disodium Inosinate, artificial color, GMO soy lecithin, Dextrose, Mono - and Diglycerides, Disodium Guanylate, GMO hydrogenated soybean oil, Sodium Caseinate
3907 2018-07-21 22:22:51 oh the pan is fine, the problem was the skins went gluey before I had much in the way of oil in there
3908 2018-07-21 22:22:43 Picked up a few
3909 2018-07-21 22:22:34 Face mask.
Shaving cream.
Lotion.
Bath salt.
Massage oil. 
Grey’s.
Drink.

Just need to wait for the kids to fall asleep and it’s ‘’me” time.
3910 2018-07-21 22:22:31 I take that back. I just looked it up and though I purchased CBD oil from a pharmacy, I cannot carry it across state lines and definitely can’t bring it internationally. There’s a lot of legal grey areas. And apparently it’s a Class 2 drug in Canada!?
3911 2018-07-21 22:22:30 Dry fry? Does it not burn? I use a lot of spices and herbs but with things like soy mince, oil adds flavour to it.
3912 2018-07-21 22:22:26 The Serious Eats Classic Banana Bread uses coconut oil!
3913 2018-07-21 22:22:21 Sure does. I will not say she didn't serve, just not in the military.
3914 2018-07-21 22:21:59 yes you are .
3915 2018-07-21 22:21:42 keep going, also research Howard Wilson's mine closures, and the oil crisis of '73. Like I said, there were a number of factors - but of course "you were there"
3916 2018-07-21 22:21:35 I personally refuse to use anything without a safety seal. I bought some lavender oil without one...took it right back
3917 2018-07-21 22:21:33 Oil
3918 2018-07-21 22:21:16 Well he needs to before the drilling for oil disfigures our national treasure. Uh thanks Zinke
3919 2018-07-21 22:20:50 Omg oil changes for newer cars is crazy

3921 2018-07-21 22:20:33 Going to Walmart with my brother: yes car oil that’s all we’re here for
Leaving Walmart: $80 worth of grocery, ice cream, 4 bags of chips, 4 different types of fruit...forgets car oil

3923 2018-07-21 22:20:20 Hey Nadine, please follow me to make it 10,001 !!
3924 2018-07-21 22:20:02 WHEN I WASHED MY STEPS WITH BUTTER, AND THE ROCK POURED ME OUT RIVERS OF OIL;
3925 2018-07-21 22:20:01 Oregano, thyme, sesame seeds, sumac, salt, pepper, olive oil.
3926 2018-07-21 22:19:51 Tbh I just want to get an oil change in this car and bounce out for a few days..
3927 2018-07-21 22:19:43 Imagine how he would've reacted if any ex-PM (especially a liberal) would have done the same thing during his time as PM. I mean, they lost their shit anytime any Canadian or foreign celeb spoke out against the oil sands or TTP. Interfering with Canadian interests etc
3928 2018-07-21 22:19:18 According to every health YouTuber you must bathe in coconut oil, eat 15 organic avocados daily, and shove a lemon up your ass to truly be thriving and cleansed
3929 2018-07-21 22:19:01 僕を酸化させたらダメだよ。オイルにとって酸化は命取り。…僕を見守っててね⁇
3930 2018-07-21 22:18:46 I received some vitamin E oil without a safety seal, is this common?
3931 2018-07-21 22:18:40 Awesome!! 
3932 2018-07-21 22:18:36 It reminds me of the oil burning trick when FIA allowed Ferrari to do it but they went to another level including a second tank (Canada 2017) and then FIA clamped it down.
Maybe they have gone over the limit even with this second and current trick.
3933 2018-07-21 22:18:21 Snake oil
3934 2018-07-21 22:18:15 I was watching an old western the other day and there was a snake oil salesman in it. I honestly thought of this bunch right away. "It's going to fix all your problems.  Don't ask me how - it's just going to."
3935 2018-07-21 22:18:10 CHS Class of 2021 CAR WASH.                Tomorrow 7/22 
@ Central Oil 10am- 2pm.                           Rain or Shine 
3936 2018-07-21 22:18:05 Congratulations, Nadine, you passed 10,000!  Great job!  
3937 2018-07-21 22:18:02 しかし、いいシナリオだった。シリウスライトの使用をアナスタシアが止めた理由もわかったしね。
3938 2018-07-21 22:18:00 I’m all for stopping horrific narcissistic parents from turning children against good loving nonpedophile parents. Counsel the children and restore the relationship. Just don’t try to sell me on that snake oil PAS or its inventor Gardner.
3939 2018-07-21 22:17:49 The ESA is incredibly successful. There is no way to justify their actions. They're doing this solely to benefit big oil companies so they can drill and build more pipelines. #Trump #MAGA #GreatestPresidentEver
3940 2018-07-21 22:17:44 pro tip for my ladies out there: if you use oil-based makeup remover, try baby oil instead. It’s half the price and doesn’t have a bunch of chemicals. also works much better. xo
3941 2018-07-21 22:17:39 & the fact thir still cuttin aboot in motors, despite it bein mega years later, & oil refineries wid stop processin petrol! lol

& how dae the heavy folk stay heavy for like 8 years!

Its less & less aboot Zombies/Survival.

Its much better whn thir on the move/exploring!
3942 2018-07-21 22:17:36 If your boyfriend can’t do your oil change hmu 
3943 2018-07-21 22:17:19 How do you cook without oil? I’m genuinely curious, I read about that but I’m always confused how people fry things?? It enhances flavour of so many things for me, am I doing cooking completely wrong 
3944 2018-07-21 22:17:15 Im SHOOK at how expensive an oil change is for Gabe’s car
3945 2018-07-21 22:17:09 Is it because Trump is pulling funding and protections for them and allowing coal and oil industries to stripmine and frack them?
3946 2018-07-21 22:16:49 Kaylas mom sent us to the smoke shop so I could buy cbd oil and gummies
3947 2018-07-21 22:16:48 I hope he finishes in the next two years cuz there won't be any national parks when Trump's finished they will all be oil fields

3949 2018-07-21 22:16:13 Use oil then go sit in the sun
3950 2018-07-21 22:15:47 What I learned today: the benefits of taking krill oil.
3951 2018-07-21 22:15:45 Healthy, organic, whatever peanut butter is gross. Like that layer of oil? Nah. I’ll pass. Gimme the fake stuff please. 
3952 2018-07-21 22:15:44 This is the one i've used recently, I add an additional teaspoon of olive oil and fresh grated parmesan. Don't forget to keep stirring while cooking, enjoy!
3953 2018-07-21 22:15:34 My mom sent me and vic to get her CBD oil
3954 2018-07-21 22:15:34 I stil got burnt even though I didn’t put tanning oil and i had sun protection on
3955 2018-07-21 22:15:29 Warm water and Murphy’s oil soap, make sure you mix them before putting it on your shoes. Then put them through the wash and air dry! Don’t use bleach, it’ll turn your shoes yellow
3956 2018-07-21 22:15:22 that oil just give you a reason to tell ya brothers you love em without looking sweet 
3957 2018-07-21 22:15:05 Happy Saturday! We have ahi tuna for our “catch of the day” . For our pasta we have a baked 3 cheese rigatoni with a 3 cheese mornay and truffle oil.
3958 2018-07-21 22:14:29 This is why we need to dump more oil into the ocean
3959 2018-07-21 22:14:27 What oil?
3960 2018-07-21 22:14:17 If your skin is already oily it doesn’t make sense to put MORE oil on it.
3961 2018-07-21 22:13:56  u know so little about Texas. Bought the pill thing bair, hook, and sinker. The Texas u describe fits a marx view of the world, one of the 19 century. Texas is far more than oil. As a country Texas economy is comparable to France. Houston alone would be the 22 richest country.
3962 2018-07-21 22:13:45 excess oil bangs a foam
3963 2018-07-21 22:13:05 The newest trend in skincare: river mud-infused hair oil
3964 2018-07-21 22:12:54 D: I think Pickles needs some oil for that squeak!!!
3965 2018-07-21 22:12:43 I don’t want oil spilled from any pipeline into any watershed. Don’t want it spilled from a train either. I think we should sit the wile thing down because we’ll destroy ourselves before we ever ease off of it.
3966 2018-07-21 22:12:31 Indigenous women have the highest rate of trafficking and assault. Mostly because the oil towns in Montana and North Dakota bring a ton of men from out of state.
3967 2018-07-21 22:12:27 Well oil me up then!
3968 2018-07-21 22:12:25 Where do you want the price of oil today Donnie? You have no idea if it should be up or down. Up and everybody in the US pays more; down and your precious oil industry  heads south. Being in charge is a bitch eh Donnie? #FakePresident #MoronsAreGoverningAmerica #MorallyUnfit
3969 2018-07-21 22:12:24 A moderate Democrat is just a lying Democrat.  
Republicans have found this to be true in posers on the right campaigning on border walls, Obamacare repeal and fiscal responsibility then not following through.
Dont fall for it.
3970 2018-07-21 22:12:19 Let me tell y’all how to take your naan to the next level. Take some extra virgin olive oil and mix some freshly pressed garlic (or garlic powder) into it. Brush that on your naan and you’re set!
3971 2018-07-21 22:12:15 i’ve been using coconut oil instead of my regular moisturizer n my skin has been so soft n clear
3972 2018-07-21 22:12:14 how many days in a row can i ignore my oil change required message in my car
3973 2018-07-21 22:12:01 If you've got a Cuisinart or food processor you can ditch the may and  just do oil and egg at the start drizzling in the oil as it goes for an  aioli base. Or, that's how it was made at every Italian joint I worked  at in my 20's. Otherwise about the same, but you need anchovy
3974 2018-07-21 22:12:01 our flat got loads of it in freshers last year and if memory serves me correctly some of it ended up being used as cooking oil
3975 2018-07-21 22:11:48 @Donjazzy does your hair smell like hot oil
3976 2018-07-21 22:11:43 Back in the day, it was a mandatory to grow hemp for the gov if you had a farm. Sails were also made of hemp. 

Henry Ford was making a hemp car that ran on a hemp fuel. Those invested in cotton, forest & oil industries didn't want to lose money to hemp/cannabis.
3977 2018-07-21 22:11:41 Isn't oil of cloves the internal use cure?
3978 2018-07-21 22:11:41 Im out of vaseline wanna masturbate can i use Olive oil ??

3980 2018-07-21 22:11:34 resurrected. had cod liver oil, coffee, and sizurp so basically right now i feel like i can lift a house. i'm going to lie down tho in case i'm still just delirious.
3981 2018-07-21 22:11:29 Radical transparency brought to the oil market by @TankerTrackers combination of @planetlabs micro satellites & ship tracking is simply awesome in its democratisation of oil markets. Combines cosmic OPEC bullshit detection with awesome global regulatory reach #OOTT
3982 2018-07-21 22:11:23 Would love to see the INDI and others launching a dispel the myth campaign on the social media promotion of such tripe. I'm sick of seeing that honey, ginger and lemon and recently  oil and cumin can cure cancer. Thankfully my mum has more sense
3983 2018-07-21 22:11:08 In VLC now, beautiful city for IGARSS 18. Thanks @IEEE_GRSS. I’m presenting my research on detecting vegetation response to Oil Pollution using hyperspectral indices in Room 3G on Wednesday, Jul 25 at 4:50 pm. Kindly join us.

3985 2018-07-21 22:10:41 Bio oil is better than any £20 face serum, vosene is better than t gel and sudocreme is better than any £8 foot cream you are very welcome
3986 2018-07-21 22:10:36 Sadly the Titleist didn’t do what you wanted it to (and cost a hell of a lot of money) maybe you should switch to a top-flight
3987 2018-07-21 22:10:31 Viv (age 3) excitedly giving her grandparents the chocolate chip cookies we baked while they took a nap: “Here, try it! It has a little bit of coconut oil in it!” 

top chef junior better watch out
3988 2018-07-21 22:10:20 Where is Hugo Chavez?1000% inflation,the social experiment has indeed become a nightmare.Yet Venezuela is rich with minerals including oil.

3992 2018-07-21 22:10:03 Wow. There is a whole lotta oil products in that pic!!
3993 2018-07-21 22:10:03 Missed me 

Followed
3994 2018-07-21 22:10:01 BABY OIL CAN GET COMPLICATED,I DID THE MATH AND I CAN TELL YOU THIS IS 100% VALID
3995 2018-07-21 22:09:50 I was wondering why no one I know buys/uses CBD oil to relieve stress and realized it's because a 1-month supply COSTS $70-80!!!!!!!! agh
3996 2018-07-21 22:09:48 Wine cheering God and man ..means the purpose of wine is to cheer as much as the purpose of oil is to honour
3997 2018-07-21 22:09:47 Argan oil is magical!
3998 2018-07-21 22:09:35 how do i casually ask whose cbd oil is on the dining room table
3999 2018-07-21 22:09:15 Before the fight they tie up the bull, rub petroleum jelly in his eyes or oil...they put cotton in his ears. Rub acid in bwtn his hind legs and pierce his genitals
4000 2018-07-21 22:09:05 Thank you for including me 
4001 2018-07-21 22:09:04 I use to hate it when my mom or nani put coconut oil in my hair but now I’m like yaaaassss nani pour it on my scalp and get my hair THIIIICKKK again
4002 2018-07-21 22:09:03 i wanna be on an island with a cute guy putting some tanning oil on me bringing me pina coladas and fresh fruit
4003 2018-07-21 22:08:38 Maybe his oil is just the tears of the voices crying out in head
4004 2018-07-21 22:08:36 Found out I can use oil on my sandwich toaster, cause using butter is gonna cost me a fortune (£1 a tub), so I'll have to use the bottle of veggie oil in the cupboard. Making some fried egg toasties tonight. Will eat better at some point. Saving to improve my pc & move house.
4005 2018-07-21 22:08:35 But the intrigue concerns Russian energy, petro-dollar, an Exxon Secty O' State, pro oil Cabinet which contains also commodity masseurs & tariff terror. We've seen already market fiddling via releases from Trick's incessant mouth. All this is on boil with opposing global warming.
4006 2018-07-21 22:08:09 Getting a little practice in for the @5hourenergy knoxville nationals? 
4007 2018-07-21 22:07:49 @GregHancock45 very shocked with your mechanic tonight out in the car park at Cardiff draining the oil from your bikes mate. Especially were he put this oil as well. Thought you had better standards than this in your team.
4008 2018-07-21 22:07:33 How about having the companies that produce the carbon pay a carbon tax? Prices for what they’re producing goes up and people will look elsewhere for alternative cleaner products. We still drive gas cars b/c government keep subsidizing oil production &suppressing clean energy
4009 2018-07-21 22:07:26 I was supposed to change my oil today but I slept instead.
4010 2018-07-21 22:07:25 every now and then my parents save up and get a steak, some fancy bread to dip in olive oil, and sparkling apple cider, and we all eat together at the table with our best dishes and stuff and pretend we’re in a fancy restaurant and it’s just rly nice and pure
4011 2018-07-21 22:07:19 @matthwatson @elirymagee you guys ever gonna try that steak dinner with nerds ? cause weve been waiting
4012 2018-07-21 22:07:12 Make sure you don't accidently drink castor oil. Then you will be sitting.

4014 2018-07-21 22:06:41 Hey...*cough cough*...oil and gas pipelines are practically really really REALLY big straws..... #BanStraws
4015 2018-07-21 22:06:34 lady in my area. So it starts with small steps to get your local McDonalds to get rid of there god awful fry oil and switch it to a more healthier oil. 
Simplot here in Idaho sends all the Mcdonalds fries out frozen. Straight from the ground to everyone in America.
4016 2018-07-21 22:06:29 我々はあと何度罪もないただ生きることに一生懸命な人類を滅ぼせばいいのか…。

4022 2018-07-21 22:05:33 Yeah if China changes their oil contracts from Iran to Saudi that can be called bad
4023 2018-07-21 22:05:31 I’m confused .. I have to change the oil? #gasmonkeygarage #FASTandLOUD
4024 2018-07-21 22:05:19 Oil is a sunset industry, divest before you get left with a useless investment.

Like prestigious universities all over the world are currently doing, to protect their endowment funds & pensions.
4025 2018-07-21 22:05:13 Happy Birthday I’m following all.

4027 2018-07-21 22:04:36 Tanning with olive oil >>>>
4028 2018-07-21 22:04:10 I’m never using baby oil again to go tanning, coconut oil is the way to go!!!  when I tan with baby oil my skin gets burnt & red & it hurts. I tanned with coconut oil while I was on vacation & it did the same except my skin didn’t hurt.
4029 2018-07-21 22:04:07 You really gotta be out there lol I recommend olive oil for tanning for next time!
4030 2018-07-21 22:03:42 Here's a scenario: Say there's a Liberal government in place and there's a technology out there that allows people to use less oil. But the Libs say we're not going to bring that technology to BC 'cos it will depress wages in that industry. You'd be howling from from the rooftops
4031 2018-07-21 22:03:41 Not olive oil
4032 2018-07-21 22:03:36 Grabe bes...ako oil change lang ng tsikot ang ni postpone ko, ikaw online exam...pordalab talaga

4033 2018-07-21 22:03:26 Into the Athabasca River, or the North Saskatchewan? Is pollution in the Arctic better than pollution in Hudson Bay? (I've had a glass or two of wine so...) But, truthfully, I don't see that oil pollution is good anywhere.
4034 2018-07-21 22:03:19 I’m sure Chiarelli had something to do with that shot 
4035 2018-07-21 22:03:12 I need help,  if a bottle of CBD oil is 500mg for 10ml can it be so concentrated to be the equivalent of 1500mg, probably a stupid question
4036 2018-07-21 22:03:02 have you steamed your head with Eucalyptus/olbas oil? Works for me but is not pleasant
4037 2018-07-21 22:02:54 Mmmm. That almost looks like Broccoli Rabe. I love making that in Olive oil with Garlic and Onions.
4038 2018-07-21 22:02:20 I love the smell of Italian Bergamot Oil in the evening...
4039 2018-07-21 22:02:10 Please, please please try rubbing extra Virgin Olive Oil with a high polyphenol count on his skin. You might be surprised! God know what healing he needs!  Will pray for Jaiden to receive His grace.
4040 2018-07-21 22:01:41 Thanks Aloha!! Followed and RT'd, please follow back!
4041 2018-07-21 22:01:30 The same logic can apply to oil consumption as well.
4042 2018-07-21 22:01:27 birthday presents needed:
-toyota crayola
-a woodlouse
-tea tree oil flavored gum
-a egg

4044 2018-07-21 22:00:48 Coconut oil clogs the fuck outta your pores.
4045 2018-07-21 22:00:39 I know it’s gross, but try eggs. Just some good old raw eggs and beat them up then massage into your scalp. Also coconut or olive oil. Leave the eggs in for like half an hour and the oil leave in overnight.
4046 2018-07-21 22:00:28 Tea Tree Oil cure everything
4047 2018-07-21 22:00:26 おーっす！はよー！今日も頑張ろーぜ！
4048 2018-07-21 22:00:26 for real! that's the poisons that come out of any gas operated vehicles!  Carbon Monoxide! God lets Satan be the 'god' of this world, along with $$$$, so that's what it's always all about, and why barely anything righteous gets done. The Oil Companies control, and all they do is
4049 2018-07-21 22:00:13 Thank you @AlohaHa59067534 
Followed/Rt'd 
4050 2018-07-21 22:00:03 Still till this day I’ve never changed oil 
4051 2018-07-21 22:00:03 I spray it every day with this rose water, vitamin E oil, and tea tree oil mix & I've been using taliah waajid tight hold for my retwists
4052 2018-07-21 22:00:01 Iran is a banana republic other than oil they only things they can export are carpets and maybe antiques. With the water crisis they won't be able to sell watermelons or dates.
4053 2018-07-21 21:59:58 High heat, low time. :) oil o the steak not the pan. No longer eat meat but when I did
4054 2018-07-21 21:59:37 I’m really mad she put baby oil
4055 2018-07-21 21:59:35 Hey Bud, get out and tough it like us Oil-Field-Trash do.
4056 2018-07-21 21:59:26 I got you!
4057 2018-07-21 21:59:24 I’ll holla u if I need a oil change on one tho g 
4058 2018-07-21 21:59:20 Did the world end? Or did we manage through it just like our nation always has in a crisis? We took steps to lessen our dependence on foreign oil. I’m fairly sure Germany could figure out an energy crisis too. And Russia would be committing economic suicide with an embargo.

4060 2018-07-21 21:58:59 As for salmond can you provide samples of lying, remember that him giving a forecast of oil price cant be a lie.
4061 2018-07-21 21:58:50 The stupidity of the behaviour in the Middle East Israel and Northern Africa is mind boggling. IF it weren't for the oil the West would dump this crowd and leave them in their own cesspit.
4062 2018-07-21 21:58:48 I know, I've seen it at dispensaries here in Oregon.   I think it's funny that a republican is pushing fear of "sex toy oil"  as reason to stop legalization.
4063 2018-07-21 21:58:35 Trump’s FAKE summit was just an excuse to talk about Deutsche Bank, laundering money and sanctions, Russian continuation of election meddling in Europe and Canada, Alaska oil etc
4064 2018-07-21 21:58:30 You’ll see western companies jumping it soon... like they jus discovered charcoal turmeric ... Argan oil.. castor oil for hair.. it’s good for scars btw...theives
4065 2018-07-21 21:58:25 The cooking oil is what puts wheat on the fries. I always ask what oils the restaurant uses. My local restaurants know about the code red diet here in the valley. They opted out of the awful cooking oil that made the fries to become gluten. So they offered the people in my area
4066 2018-07-21 21:58:20 He was using a 1:4 THC:CBD ratio oil and taking like, 0.2ml. His tolerance is nil.
4067 2018-07-21 21:58:18 Mom had part of her brain removed. Lost part of memory, still has seizures. Taking the max amount of pills too. We are now ordering Charlotte's Web CBD oil with fingers crossed that it helps. Take care of yourself. 
4068 2018-07-21 21:58:09 Embrace your curls babe they cute (oil replacements), no? Keratin treatment oh I gut u when it comes to hair ama send u the list, still? Ok hibernate at home then. I still wuv u doe :3
4069 2018-07-21 21:58:09 You need to come back east I would like to see you race here in New York
4070 2018-07-21 21:58:05 ECA is collected by taking the Excess over the oil price in the Budget. It’s taken before the Consolidated Revenue is credited to the Federation Account for sharing. Therefore it has not been subjected to the 13% derivation. From ECA, it’s transferred to the FedAcct the 13% 1st.
4071 2018-07-21 21:57:52 Audi cars are crap. They burn more oil than gas. Their customer service sucks. If you are looking for a high line car with good quality and great customer service. This isn’t the company. My A4 has less than 100k miles and we are having to add a quart of oil every 500 miles.
4072 2018-07-21 21:57:48 @babsjohnson mattmfm There is no principled anything about this hideous man. An odious snake oil salesman.
4073 2018-07-21 21:57:34 Popcorn. We have one of those hot air things so no oil. Shed load of salt....bingo.  You’re welcome
4074 2018-07-21 21:57:28 Bathed him, then did his coat with coconut oil. He even smells ok tonight. He usually stinks
4075 2018-07-21 21:57:28 Hulu has Loving Vincent (a movie about Vincent van Gogh’s life and death) and the whole movie is told through his oil paintings!! 65,000 paintings were created for this movie 
4076 2018-07-21 21:57:25 Do anybody use beard oil?
4077 2018-07-21 21:57:22 Last last sha those proposed buses as a palliative measure during the subsidy removal ish ended up as a scam.. Monies released and has been embezzled by some-one/people just like that... No trace, no questions asked... We move! After all we got oil money.. Let's spend it... Sigh.
4078 2018-07-21 21:57:14 The Iranian deal isn't only Profitable for the USA but for the global market as well. Canceling that deal have made Saudi Arabia the only reliable producer, instability in Iraq, Venezuela and the cancellation of the Iranian deal have shut down major oil producers
4079 2018-07-21 21:57:04 my mom has like three different opened jars of virgin coconut oil but no sugar how do you LIVE

4081 2018-07-21 21:56:42 It saved the UK. The UK had to ask the IMF for two loans in the seventies because the UK was just about bankrupt. Fortunately Scotland's Oil came on stream around that time & saved their bacon. They also badly mismanaged our oil & sold off fields to foreign investors for peanuts.
4082 2018-07-21 21:56:33 Oh it’s just blended Smurf in organic coconut oil
4083 2018-07-21 21:56:05 Same your source if you want to get technical. Most of these sources are pumped up by either big oil, or a scientist community that needs human made climate change to be real in order to get funding from government or donations
4084 2018-07-21 21:55:57 Oh! Or if I can get v good tomatoes, tomatoes & olive oil with a bit of salt on toast. Best eaten in the sunshine

4086 2018-07-21 21:55:22 Had to drive my car over the service well once when I was getting an oil change because none of the dudes there could drive a stick. 
4087 2018-07-21 21:55:21 (BTW, it's an especially complicated recipe for dough, olive oil, pizza sauce, asparagus and mozzarella cheese. I don't really think asparagus pizza requires 2 pages...
4088 2018-07-21 21:55:08 Thank the maker! This oil bath is going to feel so good
4089 2018-07-21 21:54:58 あ、クリアしました（ゲルダかわいいつらい）
4090 2018-07-21 21:54:57 Using #Science, explain how the barren North Slope of Alaska has such a huge supply of oil. Discuss the #Climate necessary to create such a huge quantity of a product that requires dead plants and animals for its creation. You ARE #ProScience, right? Or is that just a gimmick?
4091 2018-07-21 21:54:45 Oh no. Let me come up with some ideas! There are a lot of good cakes that use oil instead of butter.
4092 2018-07-21 21:54:42 Khamenei backs threat to stop Gulf exports if oil sales halted @AJENews. Hoping the old man follows on his threat of blocking regional oil exports. Please don't renege.
4093 2018-07-21 21:54:36 The quote part that triggered me is the "Despite his efforts..".  SH was so pro oil that he's the one that made us look intransigent.   But the article is actually pretty decent.
4094 2018-07-21 21:54:33 Time to move to New Jersey!! Gotta get me some SEX TOY OIL!!
4095 2018-07-21 21:54:20 Are you seriously this naive??? Did you see who the author of this piece is??? He’s a former executive from the OIL INDUSTRY!!! Yeah, that’s a real unbiased source right there!!! 

Wow, dude. 
4096 2018-07-21 21:54:18 You're officially crazy
4097 2018-07-21 21:54:16 Please...no one did it like Mercedes and you know it, Ferrari as far i remember tried to use an auxiliary tank @ Canada (2017) but the FIA found out and banned it.

This season the oil consumption is heavily monitored and look what happens...
4098 2018-07-21 21:54:12 Squeaky wheel gets the oil.
4099 2018-07-21 21:53:52 No way!  You had me completely fooled PogChamp It's amazing how textured and natural it looks  That is awesome! I mostly do digital these days too, but I really miss traditional media from time to time.  Especially oil.  Haven't done an oil painting in a while 
4100 2018-07-21 21:53:48 Pretty much every country is behind. Conservatives have had environment minister position since 2006. Kinda why we are so far behind.   @JustinTrudeau implemented at tax on provinces that have not come up with a system. Way more than Harper who was bought and paid for by oil.
4101 2018-07-21 21:53:42 Try adding vegetables and a beer broth for a pot roast. And good olive oil and salt for an oven roast. Just go low and slow.
4102 2018-07-21 21:53:41 Not to mention the oil fields putin will be able to get at because of rump. It will give putin $500 billion in oil

4104 2018-07-21 21:53:23 Nigeria as a country could make huge money from tourism but our attention can never be shifted to that. Eastern African countries are making cool money from it.

Our leaders are not innovative enough to see beyond crude oil.
4105 2018-07-21 21:53:16 Ppl still put coconut oil on their face? Yikes
4106 2018-07-21 21:53:08 Organic coconut oil is one of the best natural moisturizers for the skin. If you can't eat it, you shouldn't be putting it on your skin! :)

4108 2018-07-21 21:52:45 You’ve got to laugh at keyboard warrior ‘nutrition experts’ or you’ll probably cry. Did you know people who don’t cook with oil are probably lacking vitamins because most are fat soluble? Because you can’t get fat from any other source duh 
4109 2018-07-21 21:52:39 Tbh block report and ignore ppl want attention these days and it's best to not give them anyway don't add oil to the flame...and it's a very small flame
4110 2018-07-21 21:52:13 Great now I’ve got someone who thinks he’s a hypnotist following me. Don’t you even dare suggest hypnotism will help me, it’s all bollocks. If the doctors, psychiatrists & medication barely help how do you think your fake snake oil methods will? Off you fuck pal, off you fuck.
4111 2018-07-21 21:51:55 fresh oil change

4114 2018-07-21 21:51:30 Oil has to get to an end, even in those countries.
4115 2018-07-21 21:51:22 The Iranian Oil Production is essential for the stabilization of the global market, The Barrel has gone from  $45/barrel to $75/barrel since the cancellation of the Iranian deal.
4116 2018-07-21 21:51:21 Where do you think he loves Putin. He's put more sanctions than other prezs. Pushed Germany to cut off oil imports from Russia. Not sure how this ties into your claim he filed bankruptcy earlier. Seemed that was your item if concern. If loves Putin he has a funny way of showing.
4117 2018-07-21 21:51:16 ahahaha…..I lived thru the summer of 1988 here in Pittsburgh. 30 days of over 90 and a week of close to 100. And I was working at a full service gas station. walking across that lot and checking oil was a killer.
4118 2018-07-21 21:51:02 Before he went into the oil biz in Dallas
4119 2018-07-21 21:50:56 @TiresPlus how can put next oil change 30,000 miles later? Also why would you let employee put grease handprints on customers cars and leave it? Not say I will talk to them no get a damn rag and wipe it off. Not going back there!
4120 2018-07-21 21:50:55 Ferrari were also burning oil. Stop it.
4121 2018-07-21 21:50:42 It was buried.
Most folks didn't know it existed.
Social media wasn't invented yet, so people only had the MSM to rely on for info/news. I think we all know how corrupt that was (still is).
Oil revenue was used to prop up a badly run economy. Successive UK Gov's squandered it.
4122 2018-07-21 21:50:33 I just keep drinking CBD oil & napping.
4123 2018-07-21 21:50:21 Don't mind him pal.
Probably a plastic who support City since the Oil Money.

4129 2018-07-21 21:49:24 He’s nothing like Teddy Roosevelt! TR was a conservationist;we have our National Parks because of him! Trump is allowing land for oil. TR refused requests of corporate America;they don’t have to ask Trump, look at tax cut! TR VOLUNTEERED to fight in war, not hide behind a bunion!

4133 2018-07-21 21:48:54 I sure noticed yesterday when Pompeo a Nikki Haley talked about China and Russia had been caught sending some oil and coal to North Korea the media only caught one place Russia they didn’t even hear the word China
4134 2018-07-21 21:48:45 Stuck between needing to change my oil and not wanting to change my oil
4135 2018-07-21 21:48:34 Like everything, its Cost Benefit Analysis.  What's the increase in reliability of double, triple, etc redundancy to actually increasing the number/complexity of faults.
As you can imagine its bread and butter in aviation, chemical, oil etc.
4136 2018-07-21 21:48:19 Got a lil angery with the oil filter on the bike because it wouldn't break loose so i stabbed a screwdriver through it AND my oil cooler on accident. Tight.

4143 2018-07-21 21:47:07 @DrGundry Is the #Plantparadox a good plan for people with high cholesterol? I get confused about things like coconut oil which is high in saturated fat. Thanks!
4144 2018-07-21 21:47:06 90% of the girls that say they like cars probably can't even change a tire or their oil
4145 2018-07-21 21:46:54 Uhh mi amigo los estragos que hizo standar oil en mi pais condujo a una guerra de dos naciones
4146 2018-07-21 21:46:52 It doesn't take much to pull up the news articles showing what Clinton and Albright gave the NorKs in the mid 1990s. Fuel oil. Reactors. Other aid.

Hell, Albright was uncomfortable calling them a rogue state.

But, you can remain ignorant if you like.
4147 2018-07-21 21:46:29 “Give me oil in my lamp keep me burning” and somebody always adding “of kings” when it shouldn’t there!
4148 2018-07-21 21:46:26 Honestly could never eat a baked sweet potato, but pan fried with a little bit of olive oil and they’re amazing

4152 2018-07-21 21:46:05 The trouble with the 'carbon tax' idea is it doesn't touch corporate profits but it will increase the cost of everything from public transit to the food we eat. This negatively impacts working folks while big oil continues laughing all the way to the bank.
4153 2018-07-21 21:45:54 New potatoes thinly sliced, sprayed with oil and microwaved (can’t remember how long for!) then sprinkled with salt - yummy!
4154 2018-07-21 21:45:51 No all crude oil is equal. All depends where it comes from. I’ll talk about all that later. Probably tonight.
4155 2018-07-21 21:45:41 Oh my, love! While you'll be sure to love the fresh plum juice and Sicilian mandarin oil of Plum Rain, tell us what you loved so much about Flying Fox. We'll be sure to pass it along! 
4156 2018-07-21 21:45:31 I know,but rem a house is a landed property, project the proceeds from it in d long term,a car is nothing but a liability, from d house u can buy a car.
4157 2018-07-21 21:45:27 This is the same FIA, that found it incredibly difficult to stop the teams burning oil, which was clearly against the regulations. Instead of just punishing the teams for doing it they had to force their hand slowly.
4158 2018-07-21 21:45:22 Some investments track geography, such as oil wells being drilled where there's oil, diamond mines being dug where there are diamonds. This law creates tax-cut mines. Money will flow to those areas. It will be a geographical win. Now, who wins... different story.

4160 2018-07-21 21:44:59 Oh man xD Well they’re a bit of cooking work but for special occasions I mix a vegan egg yolk recipe with a mooncake recipe and make them :) the two big ingredient swaps are animal fat to coconut oil and the egg swap hehe. I’ll send you some recipes I’ve tried!
4161 2018-07-21 21:44:56 Once the oil was found there, we probably would have taken it from Mexico regardless.
4162 2018-07-21 21:44:50 I don't know how anybody can
stay around the oil business.
My best friend came that close
to losing 100s of 1000s and only
avoided a severe loss by reading
Steve's blog posts & crafting
an exit strategy.
That used to be a great safe 
moneymaker, oil. Now everyone
here wants out.
4163 2018-07-21 21:44:50 In the refining industry, crude oil is called sweet (low sulfur) if its sulfur level is less than a threshold value 0.5 wt% 5,000 ppmw and sour (high sulfur)
4164 2018-07-21 21:44:46 Everything is possible, like Mercedes burning oil for four years while the FIA said it was illegal.
4165 2018-07-21 21:44:40 Cause Oil dollars talk?
4166 2018-07-21 21:44:22 bread with oil and balsamic vinegar is the kind of stuff I dream about
4167 2018-07-21 21:44:18 Salt and Pepper mixed with some water to make a paste and put that on the area/tooth. Or Clove Oil
4168 2018-07-21 21:44:00 Fresh bread, fresh mozz, good olive oil, Delaware tomatoes....
4169 2018-07-21 21:43:49 Castor oil.
4170 2018-07-21 21:43:28 At the time Gulf Oil was a refiner for others oil companies. They eventually grew to have their own gasoline stations, and a large research center in nearby Harmarville.
4171 2018-07-21 21:43:28 The 13% to ND states is calculated base on the quantity and sales of oil from each state in a particular month. These  are deductible before sharing . And the excess is added to ECA
4172 2018-07-21 21:43:19 So you're saying those soldiers from Lag think fighting BH is like beating ppl here in Lagos fr overtaking their ogas convoy or following from behind?
4173 2018-07-21 21:43:08 Amazon is a leftist scheme to concentrate all the free world's consumer supply & production chain in the hands of one person and his leftist friends. Were JD Rockefeller still with us he would reconstitute Standard Oil and tell government "Make My Day Punks"
4174 2018-07-21 21:43:08 Got tea tree oil in my eye. Start planning my funeral
4175 2018-07-21 21:42:53 my sister dmed me to ask which essential oil diffuser she should get
4176 2018-07-21 21:42:33 Gettin the ear wax sucked out ma ears in 3 weeks for the fourth time in my life so the nights of puttin olive oil in ma ears start again. Bliss x :)
4177 2018-07-21 21:42:26 The IS20 to IS38 turbo swap process has begun... So far the oil and coolant has been drained, down-pipe/intake/battery tray has been removed...

Next steps are to disconnect all associated coolant lines and remove coils and solenoids as well as charge pipe and hard lines
4178 2018-07-21 21:42:13 I’ve never had that problem. It’s a light oil though so I use it more often and make sure you get the organic or all natural kind
4179 2018-07-21 21:42:10 Faysel and Kaitlyn are not spiritually compatable. Fexxy is toxic and abusive. Kaitlyn has dependent personality issues. Both are spiritually polar opposite in their belief systems, oil and water.
4180 2018-07-21 21:42:00 I'm so dark. I menstruate oil.
4181 2018-07-21 21:41:57 Here's a tip: Use argan oil instead. It has no odour at all. I've been using it and find it is excellent. Just at night though.
4182 2018-07-21 21:41:57 After having an oil change on my car yesterday at Elk Grove Toyota, the steering wheel jumps violently to the left or right almost pulling me off the road!  What did the service tech do to make my car unsafe to drive? Never again do I trust this business! @elkgrovetoyota
4183 2018-07-21 21:41:23 When you’re loyal to your auto shop and have so many points accumulated over the years of repairs, you get free oil changes. Win, Win, WIN!
4184 2018-07-21 21:41:15 Right now my daughter wants me to go fry chicken wings cause she likes fried wings and garlic bread but I hate doing it cause the hot oil bounces out the pan and burns me every time 
4185 2018-07-21 21:41:14 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.
4186 2018-07-21 21:41:13 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
4187 2018-07-21 21:41:09 Trump Putin want that oil deal with Exxon put back on the table that was the plan w R Tillerson being SOS, To kill the sanctions Obama and Hillary put in place . Why attack Merkel and USSR oil deal #500BillionReasonsWhy @realDonaldTrump

4189 2018-07-21 21:40:53 avocado sunflower seed coconut oil salad sent me to another place
4190 2018-07-21 21:40:49 is it not detrimental for engines?
4191 2018-07-21 21:40:42 Just got a thought that the hashtags you put there can be treated as a material and paint used for other art, like “oil on canvas”.

“CSS on canvas”, “SVG on canvas” etc. :D
4192 2018-07-21 21:40:34 How's that oil short going?
4193 2018-07-21 21:40:29 …むにゃ…ぐぅ(エルザちゃんに寄りかかる
4194 2018-07-21 21:40:28 Oil and stuff gets rid of them. I had some on my thighs cuz at some point I wouldn’t stop eating but when I lost weight it faded and oil helps
4195 2018-07-21 21:40:12 これ？ドレッシングっていうか廃油。
4196 2018-07-21 21:39:59 i went to the mall and found so much good stuff on sale and then got $20 off my oil change does this mean my life is getting better
4197 2018-07-21 21:39:56 bio oil is my holy grail, cost $8-12 depending on the size & it last for the longest time! :)
4198 2018-07-21 21:39:42 I did it tonight but I added crispy chilli oil.  I loved it. I thought the egg would be weird but the soy helps  and cuttlefish balls.
4199 2018-07-21 21:39:42 Jesus! The tinfoil bunnet wearing part of this country have really got their collective dander up tonight. Did someone ask about the secret oil fields again?
4200 2018-07-21 21:39:40 God of Palestine
4201 2018-07-21 21:39:34 And always use colola oil for Chinese cooking
4202 2018-07-21 21:39:08 for real: when Mr. Drumpf tweets, a sad wolf prays for help #resist
4203 2018-07-21 21:38:56 Lol ,stop looking at short term effects,project always ...
What is car?
4204 2018-07-21 21:38:55 I love my dad. He’s a car technician (not a mechanic, there’s a difference). I needed all new tires, front struts, rear brakes, a new battery, and an oil change. That would have been, what, close to $1600/1700?... He only charged $300. Thanks daddy!!!! 
4205 2018-07-21 21:38:55 Use any hair oil like olive oil or coconut oil on damp hair. Applying oil or product on damp hair absorbs better.
4206 2018-07-21 21:38:53 What I have discovered is when POTUS tweets and the haters come. Reply with them (as a reminder) that God willing and we get a super majority in the midterms, there will be a price to be paid. I remind them of AT&T and Standard oil. WINTER IS COMING FOR THEM...
4207 2018-07-21 21:38:38 How might we support Oil & Energy to experiment more kindly? #cloudcomputing
4208 2018-07-21 21:38:36 Wtf shes no oil painting
4209 2018-07-21 21:38:34 

Well if this is what’s going on, I need a vibrating cock ring that has grape flavored CBD oil on it
4210 2018-07-21 21:38:02 The best feeling is taking your car to get an oil change & tire rotation and leaving with just that, nothing extra needing to be done.  #AdultingHappy
4211 2018-07-21 21:38:01 i nev believe 9ja was so hard until i saw a girl eating bread wit anointing oil.......:-
4212 2018-07-21 21:37:50 As for Iran, it’s your country and you call it terrorist regime. So you should be a terrorist. We buy oil, we do trade which we have to in order to diversify our energy resources.
4213 2018-07-21 21:37:49 WELLLLL rstar, what if I told you it was neither wet nor dry? ;) its digital. But im a big traditional art person. Thank you so much sweetheart.  <3 I love oil pastels colored pencil!
4214 2018-07-21 21:37:42 No. Magic words don't get you out of the hole of your own making. 
Tell me why the environmental effects of onshore shale fracked oil/gas extraction is intrinsically worse than Wytch Farm.
And of course you can't. Because essentially there isn't any difference. Is there?
4215 2018-07-21 21:37:36 Sounds mental but coconut oil removes literally everything
4216 2018-07-21 21:37:26 By natural resources I mean oil/gas. Aluminum/glass really only things that actually get recycled. China not accepting contaminated recycled so most goes to landfill now because no ones buying. 

In the end I think having more independents is answer. 2 parties not representative
4217 2018-07-21 21:37:07 Smfh RT @KILAHstaysBASED: okay so what happens when you take too long to get an oil change? cause I was highkey supposed to get one almost 2k miles ago X__X
4218 2018-07-21 21:37:06 I'm thinking grilled. With a splash of olive oil

4222 2018-07-21 21:36:20 Thanks.  We have to give credit where it is due.  The @MBuhari Administration have done well in #LocalContent development in the Oil and Gas sector through the @wabote_simbi led #NCDMB. Let's just hope it's extended to other sectors so we won't have repeats of things like this.

US oil drillers pay no carbon tax. Alberta drillers will.
4231 2018-07-21 21:35:33 Good luck kid.
4232 2018-07-21 21:35:29 face mask (cont.)
mix aloe, honey and capsule in a small bowl to create a gummy like face mask. add in a few drops of coconut oil and massage on your face and other burnt areas for two-three minutes. let sit for 15 minutes and wash off with cold water. apply toner
4233 2018-07-21 21:35:27 The guy at the oil place said he would do it for half off if I gave him my number...

So naturally, I decided to pay the full price instead lmao

4235 2018-07-21 21:35:10 Only last year started cannabis oil treatment with positive results. I don't know about preventing cancer but imagine if it can cure it can prevent. Lacks more scientific studies about this. So sorry for your lost @WhatBitcoinDid
4236 2018-07-21 21:35:08 almond oil just treats your skin different. that’s my new shit.
4237 2018-07-21 21:35:07 The Oil & Gas industry must love this. Profits for few. Climate change for all...
4238 2018-07-21 21:35:04 RT @LivingSafely: General Mills #Bugles this July? Its top four ingredients are corn meal, coconut oil, sugar and salt.
4239 2018-07-21 21:35:02 Yup, we don’t say “free defense contracts” or “free oil subsidies”
4240 2018-07-21 21:34:44 The Al-Yammah arms deal with Saudi Arabia for oil is one such deal. That won’t end. It is less than in the EU. Yet it isn’t nothing. They won’t suddenly end when we leave. Renegotiation isn’t the same as not having an ongoing responsibility to an existing deal.
4241 2018-07-21 21:34:22 Is it  yoga and coconut oil ?????
4242 2018-07-21 21:34:12 Can of chickpeas mixed in a bowl with some oil, salt, pepper, smoked paprika, roll onto a baking sheet and oven until crunchy (high temp, not sure on the time I just keep checking them).
4243 2018-07-21 21:34:11 When my brother was diagnosed with cancer the first think my parents did was asses how much was in the the savings, then they check the lifetime cap on the insurance.

Even with top insurance (major oil company) they paid a decent mount in deductibles and out of pocket costs.
4244 2018-07-21 21:34:06 Bugnaw nga halang ning tea tree oil oy! Haha
4245 2018-07-21 21:33:57 All of you that is going last day last week last year. One day you do find what you are looking for. Me never go. Drinking holy olive oil every month.
4246 2018-07-21 21:33:54 Interesting. Good luck finding "extra virgin" olive oil. Many, if not most, olive oils are not fresh and contain seed oil -- AKA vegetable oil. Seed oil is voodoo bad for your health and longevity. The best thing you can do to preserve your brain is avoid statins like the plague.
4247 2018-07-21 21:33:17 Lol nida nakeda budurwa back then at Samaru mai awara,da yayi zafi ya soyu Zata kirani nayi booking
4248 2018-07-21 21:33:13 Could’ve been off now if it wasn’t for this shop not doing the oil change 
4249 2018-07-21 21:33:12 I had three leftover tortillas that needed eating.  Sliced them into triangles and popped them in a hot oven with a spritz of oil and lashings of salt and pepper until browned.

They went very well with my veggie chilli this eve!  Baked tortilla chips!  Will do again...

4251 2018-07-21 21:33:08 Caprese is mozzarella, tomato, fresh basil, salt/pepper and olive oil. Sometimes balsamic vinegar I believe.
4252 2018-07-21 21:32:43 Hope you sleep better tonight, CBD oil is definitely worth a try, when my insomnia was really bad I would go 48hrs without sleep, ended up on Mirtazipine as a last resort x
4253 2018-07-21 21:32:31 Looks like Carpinteria beach area with the oil platform in the background

4255 2018-07-21 21:32:11 finally washed conditioned and hot oil treated my hair 
4256 2018-07-21 21:32:09 @ProfOsinbajo sir pls sir let there be a mechanism that will consistently and constantly maintain a flow of traffic & also stop trucks & oil tankers parked on the road side in satellite town and apapa axis. It is one thing to make an order and its another to maintain such order.
4257 2018-07-21 21:32:02 Well, the entire company switched to hydrogenated vegetable oil in 2006. So they certainly don't cook in fish oil. For one, it would be an extremely expensive addition to their oil.

4260 2018-07-21 21:31:49 The argument you just used "they changed the name from global warming to climate change" was a talking point developed by oil funded think tanks. It is also a lie. And here you are faithfully repeating the same lie. So who has been suckered? How did it get in your brain?
4261 2018-07-21 21:31:49 any oil will soften it and take it right off. let it sit for like 2 minutes so it’ll be easy!<3

4264 2018-07-21 21:31:32 Marching for 5 minutes and snapping a selfie gives them an activist exemption to use as much oil as they want without being hypocrites....
4265 2018-07-21 21:31:31 Then how is my nephew making six figures a year creating CBD oil‘s and starting a company called happy farms??? I use the CBD oil he produces. FDA just approved CBD oil now his company will skyrocket
4266 2018-07-21 21:31:17 I got a 1999 Camry I’ll sell you for 600 dollars. It needs new tires the windows don’t work, and it needs an oil change and transmission fluid and badly in need of a bath.
4267 2018-07-21 21:31:09 If he has $ in Russian oil stocks why would he want to increase US production? He hasn't ended any sanctions, in fact he has increased them. Plus increased $ to NATO etc. Fact is, the Trump/Russia collusion conspiracy theory is ludicrous to any thinking person.
4268 2018-07-21 21:31:08 I was CURLER QUEEN when I was in grade school—I had curly, out of control frizzy hair, & liked the smooth curl. Ever since high school, I like my natural curl. Hint: Argon Oil shampoo, conditioner, & treatments, tame the frizz. Get Costco’s Orlando Pita shampoo & conditioner.

4275 2018-07-21 21:30:05 You need to stop jacking off the oil industry. Why not focus on moving away from oil? Granted oil is expected to shorten in 50 years. Unless you believe in end times prophecy the world will keep on spinning for millions of years more. Oil wont last 100 more years.
4276 2018-07-21 21:29:57 I had to use progesterone all month long with no breaks at first. Ideally you’d only use it second half of your cycle, post ovulation till period, but if you’re very sick, use as needed. Progestelle is a good potent one to try, dissolved in coconut oil. Progest e is in vit e oil.

4280 2018-07-21 21:29:17 Hey man that's good, I've been whole food plant based - no oil - no animal products for about a year now. Not strict, still eat a burger or hotdog once every few months and eat lots of baked goods. I need to do my bloodwork too.

4282 2018-07-21 21:29:06 and as I said if they did that I'd know and never eat there again. I am very allergic to fish and it is an instant trigger. I can't walk when it's in my system because it makes me so ill. I found that out the hard way when I was given medicine with fish oil in it, when a doctor
4283 2018-07-21 21:28:56 In future I'll drink a cup of sunflower oil and stay at home where I can at least experiment with self medication and have access to lying down.

4290 2018-07-21 21:27:49 Of course not all. And I’m sure they don’t believe what they say sometimes. Hopefully we can agree that republicans have a longer history with support from oil/gas industry. Quick example  President Carter put solar panels on White House, Reagan took them off

4300 2018-07-21 21:26:23 You seriously have to ask that?Most of the law makers have their pockets loaded with Coal&Oil money! Solar cuts into their pockets! Same reason Trump is trying to revitalize the coal industry & put major tariffs on solar panels from China cuz they’re the leaders of that industry!
4301 2018-07-21 21:25:57 Chris Speier and Ron Guidry for this southpaw. Forty years later, I still have them along with the @neatsfoot oil.
4302 2018-07-21 21:25:46 and then there's me hallucinating on CBD oil. . .
4303 2018-07-21 21:25:44 I believe Obama needs to be sued for every crooked and honest dime he earned. Especially extortion of BP for oil spill.. Don't forget BP oil spill and his talk privately with BP chief exec.
4304 2018-07-21 21:25:40 By oil you mean for topical use? Or like the vape oils? It would just vary on the strength. I’d say for ingestion tinctures would probably be best because they get absorbed much quicker whereas with edibles you have to wait 30-60 min + to get relief
4305 2018-07-21 21:25:34 Coconut oil with a cotton pad, works wonders
4306 2018-07-21 21:25:34 Day 21.
Country flatteneds quikly after Rockies in Alberta. Cowboys and oil.
4307 2018-07-21 21:25:30 Sometimes I have to make my own beignets with, biscuit dough rolled flat, and cut into small triangles.  Then I dip them into hot oil,  turn quickly until brown and, puffy. Then I  take them out and dump into a bag of confectioners sugar..
Good in a cravings pinch!
4308 2018-07-21 21:25:14 Friend made an #eclipse oil, anointed herselft - it felt so bad she feared she may die, and had tons of lizards start chasing her. She stored it in salt. Vowed to never do eclipse magic again. Hilarious, as these things go, but still... #eclipsemagicstories

4313 2018-07-21 21:24:27 Oil producing states have a special status because they bear a large cost for the country to earn revenue.
If Lagos also seeks a special status, because it is right now bearing a huge cost (trailer-blocked roads) for the nation’s economy to thrive, it makes complete sense.

4316 2018-07-21 21:23:45 okay so what happens when you take too long to get an oil change? cause I was highkey supposed to get one almost 2k miles ago X__X
4317 2018-07-21 21:23:34 Get condemned engine oil and pure as many as you can get into your septic tank. Look out for any place water settle around and pure oil too. Thank me later.
4318 2018-07-21 21:23:22 I said that to say its the 21st and you know you have to be obedient. Sow if you can't do $21 do what he said do $2.18. I mean for now that's all some got but its our process lets go thru the pain of the sowing to get the oil! The oil is coming!
4319 2018-07-21 21:23:11 Thought we established last year that it was Bill Clinton. Looks nothing like Trump, but a whole lot like Billy

4321 2018-07-21 21:22:43 for cbd, which do you feel has a better effect, oil or edibles?
4322 2018-07-21 21:22:40 Very unhappy it took all day for an oil change and a new air filter @NorthtownAuto with a 9:30 appointment. And on top of that I need to go back next week to have my mirror put on the car

4325 2018-07-21 21:22:29 Home between shows. Home is currently a corporate apartment with great light and laundry machines in my closet. Dinner was the arugula avocado red bell pepper shredded cheese olive oil and fresh lemon dressing. No egg. And now I will make a rich cup of decaf coffee. 
4326 2018-07-21 21:22:17 This lawmaker sounds like he needs therapy.  Sex toys?  Lipstick?  all kinds of things people can get he says, with oil.  Sigh.
4327 2018-07-21 21:22:14 Chickpeas fried in a little oil and some ground cumin seeds are delicious! They’re a bar snack in Israel and when I was there I get through two or three bowls over one pint! Really delicious, though, and you can make ahead as they store well.
4328 2018-07-21 21:22:09 not every fastfood place cooks their fish in the same oil, or I'd never be able to eat there. I get violantly ill when I consume any fish or fish oil.
4329 2018-07-21 21:21:43 afternoon. still shatterday! come save 5 dollars on all oil products above $25
4330 2018-07-21 21:21:21 We dont have to justify our spending on players to anybody, we dont have billionaire oil barons who can just by players on a whim.. We've had to consistently sell our best players, up revenue streams, to be in the position we are now..
4331 2018-07-21 21:21:08 It's possible they just cook their fries in the same oil as the fish. Which is the case at every fast food restaurant. They use vegetable oil, though.
4332 2018-07-21 21:21:08 I am. It's just...feels like the Tin Man before Dorothy finds the oil can.
4333 2018-07-21 21:21:08 I went to get the oil changed and then to Target while apparently with my zipper down.  Am I embarrassed? A little.  But when I think that my crotch enjoyed air conditioning for two hours I don't feel so embarrassed anymore.
4334 2018-07-21 21:20:33 Without a doubt the two single most anxious places to be in this world is the dentist office and getting my oil changed. I'm about to go get my oil changed and am gonna have a full blown panic attack while doing so but it's been like 10,000 over because I freak out every time. 
4335 2018-07-21 21:20:33 pop some popcorn in olive oil with a little sea salt - it’s affordable and more satisfying than chips!

4337 2018-07-21 21:19:42 I don't have psoriasis, but eczema (atopic+dishydrodic) and I need to be completely grain and seed (incl. legumes) free to be completely symptom free. Thursday I had a tiny bit of sesame oil, and had a blister on my hand a few hours later.
4338 2018-07-21 21:19:35 Congrats !!!
4339 2018-07-21 21:19:35 What is this printing you keep talking about? You print trade tickets not oil demand growth (which won’t be negative)
4340 2018-07-21 21:19:28 Terribly trendy, but Kale crisps are great. Ten minutes in an oven, bit of oil and soy sauce....slurp. I also like mixed seeds dry fried with soy, too...
4341 2018-07-21 21:19:25 Coconut oil is good for everything! But yes lol

4346 2018-07-21 21:19:06 Not to rain on your parade but it's not like they won't be somebody else lining up to buy their oil. The only way to hurt your oil profits is to sanction anybody who buys it. Oh and don't mention that this probably has to do with Trump convincing China not to support terrorism.
4347 2018-07-21 21:19:05 Cut up sheets of lasagne pasta, coated with Fry Light cooking oil (and salt or paprika or something for flavouring) and baked in the oven until crispy. An ex colleague of mine used to make them regularly for us at work. They were delish!

4350 2018-07-21 21:18:55 At least you have a countrywide network of trains...delayed is better than no trains and zero political will to build the service because so many @GOP politicians are in thrall to the oil companies.
4351 2018-07-21 21:18:54 Okay, people knowledgeable about, Canna pills need info. Got sick gallbladder, could the coconut oil be too fatty for my gallbladder, input please
4352 2018-07-21 21:18:50 lampstand is light and this was the spiritual purpose for Israel. Israel ­was chosen to be a “light to the world,” to represent God’s love for man. God required the priests to refuel the seven lamps daily with pure olive oil so the seven lights on
4353 2018-07-21 21:18:40 I feel like someone should have warned me that tea tree oil stinks. 
4354 2018-07-21 21:18:32 Awwww
4355 2018-07-21 21:18:28 It looks great!  You have a very unique style ^^

And I like your balance of values and contrast.  Was this a mixture of wet and dry media?  It looks like a mix of oil and either pastels or colored pencil.  Either way, you produced some really good strokes ^^ Really good job 
4356 2018-07-21 21:18:25 With the current brilliant weather we decided to have a Mediterranean starter Tonight, ciabatta with raw tuna, olives,anchovies, capers,tomatoes, chilli, parsley, lemon zest and juice and olive oil. Delicious, we'll certainly have it again
4357 2018-07-21 21:17:52 So if sunflower oil is made out of sunflowers and olive oil made out of olives.... then... is baby oil made out of babies!
4358 2018-07-21 21:17:41 A good oil cleanser won’t dry your skin out. If you have drier skin, try Dermalogica’s Precleanse Balm. It’s for a dry skin type!
4359 2018-07-21 21:17:20 The thin, frayed ends of his hair brushed along his jaw and neck. He swayed a moment against Connor. He was heavy and quite dense. In that moment Connor thought, irresistibly, of the texture of Hank's hair against his hand. The fine layers of oil that gradated from the scalp.
4360 2018-07-21 21:17:15 Looks like bill clinton to me lol
4361 2018-07-21 21:16:51 3) that’s like turning your head while your neighbor dumped oil into the creek that runs behind his house and through the neighborhood because it was on his property.  Just saying...
4362 2018-07-21 21:16:48 Not the biggest fan of kale, but show it to some old fryer oil?! On. Trend.

4366 2018-07-21 21:16:08 Home made crisps with some of your chicken stock/soup find sprinkled over them after the oil before they go in the oven?  Still crisps but you’re in control of the quantity (I could easily eat 6 bags back to back also)
4367 2018-07-21 21:16:02 Yes!  Especially when you see where and how some of these tv pastors live- their parishioners can barely hold it together but donate to these fraudsters who reassure them that they’re on the path to heaven with their donations.  Snake oil salesmen, just like Trump.
4368 2018-07-21 21:15:53 Nobody has any use for the worthless, opportunistic bastards on either side.  Hang 'em.  Boil 'em in oil. Grind 'em up into donkey food.  Real Republicans don't care. We're content to see 'em leave.

4388 2018-07-21 21:12:29 I told you I am doing the gym to get and keep my shit in shape! Now I am getting my good in check! Straight stir fry and olive oil and no Bread!
4389 2018-07-21 21:12:16 Companies pay money to advertise and therefore get to decide what platforms they advertise on.  Do you disagree?  If an oil company doesn't want their advertisements shown in a magazine that is anti-OPEC it is no different.  Because it implicitly endorses that message.
4390 2018-07-21 21:12:10 And the problem is????? 

Do they know they just made everyone google  cannabis oil & sex? 


4391 2018-07-21 21:12:09 And real grass fed rare red meat Cooked in real Cold Press Coconut Oil ( that is also bad for people too... Pfftt). Come watch the raw beef blood trickle down my cheeks.. yumm.. love avocado, real butter.. hmm I’m still gym slim though!!! Why??
4392 2018-07-21 21:12:09 I’m thinking about becoming a vape god to eliminate my bad dipping habit. Should I use CBD oil or nicotine? Could there be both?

No cages

And we spray people down with fish oil 

Because it's really about exercise

4397 2018-07-21 21:10:45 I just feel like if all I want is an oil change that takes 10 minutes, I shouldn’t have an hour wait!!  Do my car first so I can go head out to way 
4398 2018-07-21 21:10:43 Don't let this be you. Change your oil at regular maintenance intervals.

4407 2018-07-21 21:09:54 Go to get an oil change today by my cousin. Small talk for a few. Hands me a box of baseball cards to have cause he knows I’m a baseball guy. I say dope, thanks. Get home. Look trough the roughly 200 cards. And pow. Rookie Ken Griffey Jr card. Biggest erection ever. #thekid
4408 2018-07-21 21:09:25 That's just pure nonsense. Israel has helped the US immensely in the war on terror for decades. And have themselves made bad decisions at the behest of the US. The US stopped them from completely decimating the Arab armies in 1973 and keeping the Sinai and it's oil for example.

4411 2018-07-21 21:08:55 ...but that doesn’t mean that the U.K. is supplying credit the same way that SA supplies oil.
4412 2018-07-21 21:08:49 I use tea tree oil for spots and it helps reduce them never tried it on my pores 
4413 2018-07-21 21:08:39 I do t agree with this assesment. Oil and gas receive standard tax benefits that all industries receive. “Renewables” are subsidized at unsustainable levels. Also There has to be a realization that “clean energy” is often produces more pollution than traditional methods.
4414 2018-07-21 21:08:33 This person part of the Nashville Songwriters community all of us have long mailing and large social media numbers. Do you really want the entire nation to learn you did not put the oil in?
4415 2018-07-21 21:08:27 No, my Dad worked in the steel and oil industries.

4429 2018-07-21 21:06:58 His nose wrinkled. His pupils were sleep-dilated, & he looked at Connor as if in confusion. Connor wondered what the mucus to oil content of the discharge would prove to be if he should pick it from Hank's eye and analyze.

"Connor," he prompted. "The android sent by CyberLife."
4430 2018-07-21 21:06:58 Hahaha, I’ll just have to cover you and your bed sheets in the oil then haha
4431 2018-07-21 21:06:48 A few months ago my eyelash curler broke some of my eyelashes in half and after putting castor oil on RELIGIOUSLY they’re finally all nice and full again so I don’t feel the need to put on an eye weave anymore, I’m so happy :’)
4432 2018-07-21 21:06:24 A person recounting something that they believe happened them is magic? I think you've been smoking too much snake oil.
4433 2018-07-21 21:06:20 They have more regulation than USA - and Venezuela is a good lesson on why you shouldn't sell out to the oil industry or attempt to "control the mean of productions"
4434 2018-07-21 21:06:16 We tap Alaska as well as the off shore, we will have no need for foreign oil at all. We will also be able to create a surplus to where prices can be back below a dollar a gallon, reducing cost of products giving a better way of life to all. A real solution
4435 2018-07-21 21:05:57 Exactly, we can charge the English a fortune for the water and oil. And we will have all the benefits of the EU and the trade agreements they have rather than all the ones the UK is about to lose.
4436 2018-07-21 21:05:53 That oil should finish already,let's see what happens next,if there will be a little hope for circulation of money when other industries are given a chance to grow the economy.
4437 2018-07-21 21:05:31 Too fucking bad!!! If a companies business plan can't make money then they should close their doors!! I didn't see any government money passed on to all the small businesses when oil shit the bed. Stop bailing out bad businesses!! #bullshit
4438 2018-07-21 21:05:19 After childbirth my edges thinned out and I had a few bald spots. Thank God for olive and castor oil and good genes!
4439 2018-07-21 21:05:11 curious if $TPGE to $MGY has this whole group in M&A mode especially with big players moving in and with money in their pockets since dumping Canadian oil operations over the last year or two.....?
4440 2018-07-21 21:05:07 Et pourquoi changer son nom ? Ça faisait trop arabe ? Oil a fallu le franciser ..et on nous traite de RACISTES , et il est de quel côté pour ce changement de nom ?
4441 2018-07-21 21:05:03 Feb. 1962, #FBIEP Agents apprehended, James L. Pope, wanted for extortion.  Pope had sent a letter to a prominent West Texas rancher and oil man threatening his children if he did not pay the sum of $50,000.  #FBIEP
4442 2018-07-21 21:04:48 Take my car to the shop for an oil change and get a long list of what else is wrong with my car lmao every time
4443 2018-07-21 21:04:39 It's a distraction by the snake oil salesman that you can ignore. It's not even pre-season.
4444 2018-07-21 21:04:31 @grovecollab I just received my package yesterday and my coconut oil was leaking :/
4445 2018-07-21 21:04:20 Makeup lovers: What's a melanin-friendly foundation that stays on all day? Would like it to at least be buildable to medium coverage, and hopefully it won't break down when the oil comes through. (Normal/combo skin here!)
4446 2018-07-21 21:04:13 i can’t wait to use my Shea butter soap/oil tonight... my skin is so dry lately 
4447 2018-07-21 21:04:13 Please please take the canola oil out of your products! My family likes your products alot! ...but canola causes so many health issues and we, like many others have an adverse reaction to it! We buy tons of the sausages because they don't have canola!
4448 2018-07-21 21:04:11 Texas is where it's at! Bring on the oil baby 
4449 2018-07-21 21:04:09 I tweet for people who remember when olay was ‘oil of olay’.
4450 2018-07-21 21:03:39 It was a busy day yesterday with the Lucas Oil Off Road Racing Series at Wild West Motorsports Park in Reno, Nevada.
4451 2018-07-21 21:03:21 the world will never run out of oil as we will always have my pores
4452 2018-07-21 21:03:18 i washed ny hair for the second time and put some argon oil in it and its so soft
4453 2018-07-21 21:03:05 Crude oil prices on the rise again and just can't imagine economy will look this good and inflation will be contained if that happens.
4454 2018-07-21 21:02:47 Can’t watch #GameOfThrones seriously anymore after listening to @AthleticoMince - Jaime Lannister and his brass hand oil
4455 2018-07-21 21:02:42 Nothing makes me more anxious than going to get an oil change
4456 2018-07-21 21:02:32 One day off...all I desire is a soft tissue massage with warm oil  and my bed.
4457 2018-07-21 21:02:15 oil painting portrait perfect.
4458 2018-07-21 21:02:13 Oh ok it's a port, maybe to sell the oil? Or possibly Navy base for that region?
4459 2018-07-21 21:02:02 Ava: why are you naked and covered in baby oil?
Sara: you know how you say I never glisten?
Ava: listen. you never listen.
Sara: oh.
4460 2018-07-21 21:01:53 Idea: Aquaman speaks to the genetically enhanced sharks from Deep Blue Sea, end environmental destruction by having them destroy oil liners :D
4461 2018-07-21 21:01:47 At least we’re not purchasing 70% of our oil from Russia, that’s our Ally who takes our money to defend against aggressors like Russia and turns around and boosts their economy.
4462 2018-07-21 21:01:25 I don’t use milk but I do know salt makes them tough.. I use a hot pan and half Olive oil and half butter just enough to coat the pan and scrap them back and forth. Very fluffy and tender. You can salt at tge last second it you like.
4463 2018-07-21 21:01:20 I'm a Marvel Magic Mystery Oil man myself.
4464 2018-07-21 21:00:58 Ash making scene out of it. same pons said they are very talented but they are not worried about. They feel insecure on seeing audience claps. Danny using them to get focus. Danny not trying to solve issue he is pouring more oil.
4465 2018-07-21 21:00:47 when in fact they are the puppets to the government and when they come back with a leg blown off they get no support or money. The answer- do not support the wars, the wars made by government and supported by underhand arms deals and oil.
4466 2018-07-21 21:00:46 And drank a lot of oil
4467 2018-07-21 21:00:40 To be fair that was what I was envisioning was the human equivalent of being deep fried levels of oil covered.
4468 2018-07-21 21:00:39 Snake oil!!!!!!!! Just shy, grip shoes, latchkey kids, cherry lemon, & I’ll finish this book later
4469 2018-07-21 21:00:35 @NNPCgroup has finally blackmailed @HMKemiAdeosun with the nysc certificate issues and other means to accepting less than what Nigeria should get from oil sales. @channelstv @ShehuSani
4470 2018-07-21 21:00:28 Pls when u become president

Help us and overthrow this wicked regime called federal government of Nigeria
We the poor masses have suffered a lot despite how rich we are with our oil and other natural resources.
Our politicians are the wicked set of people in d world
4471 2018-07-21 21:00:24 A little rose oil on occasion.
4472 2018-07-21 21:00:21 RT @LivingSafely: General Mills #Bugles this July? Its top four ingredients are corn meal, coconut oil, sugar and salt.
4473 2018-07-21 21:00:21 last night my mom and sister massaged my whole body with coconut oil it was so nice
4474 2018-07-21 21:00:03 July 21, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
4475 2018-07-21 20:59:55 Companies pay money to advertise and therefore get to decide what platforms they advertise on.  Do you disagree?  If an oil company doesn't want their advertisements shown in a magazine that is anti-OPEC it is no different.  Because it implicitly endorses that message.
4476 2018-07-21 20:59:53 Following all and thank you for your follow-back! #Trump2020 
4477 2018-07-21 20:59:48 Shoutout to the coworker that dropped hot vat oil on my arm and leg, appreciate ya
4478 2018-07-21 20:59:41 I put way too much chili oil in my lo mein, woooops 
4479 2018-07-21 20:59:33 She passed away at 47. I am glad to have some of her work related things. When the work shifted to air traffic control, she was programming out at an airfield test site. I have pics of her in a field trailer in oil cloth mil jumpsuit and another in her lady office attire.
4480 2018-07-21 20:59:32 Very bad pollution in city effecting public health. .remove this busses from city. ..no maintenance at all from RTC very bad conditions bus not clean bus setting like oil and grease. ..
4481 2018-07-21 20:59:30 @jiffylube your franchise in Sherwood OR, just wrecked a friend of mine's engine by not putting any oil in it. She's a working musician, 1000 miles from home. They've admitted fault, but aren't helping fix her van. She's stuck. What can we do?
4482 2018-07-21 20:59:20 ridiculous thing is...this guy was college age. To him this is most likely a summer job. He's a smooth talker and he looks the part. Clean cut, could-be-a-grandkid to most people in this neighborhood. Snake oil salesman.
4483 2018-07-21 20:59:16 I am jealous. I have followed more people than ever this week and have an extra bad followback ratio. It is like this is Smellatweet and I have BO.
4484 2018-07-21 20:59:12 Hot oil treatment and face mask 
4485 2018-07-21 20:58:42 No fr , mfs felt like hard ass rocks. I bought some sage oil and it went down quick
4486 2018-07-21 20:58:42 In early 2014, the prices of crude oil were somewhere around 105USD/bbl. In the next few months that fell sharply and continued to fall until @ end of 2015 it was 30USD/bbl. So this automatically means that it has a huge bearing on the macrobalances. Not like this govt did get.
4487 2018-07-21 20:58:25 Turning on "tropical rain sounds" with lavender oil burning while my friends take a nap. They'll thank me once they wake up from a VERY vivid dream . #NeverFails
4488 2018-07-21 20:58:14 You need to read up on the facts of those cases. So tell me what the medical facts of Charlie Gard and Alfie Evans were. Not Fox News facts but real facts. I'll wait. Answer that and answer if you like the military. Venezuela is the victim of US interference...large oil reserves
4489 2018-07-21 20:58:07 I have created over a thousand oil.

4490 2018-07-21 20:58:06 Caralhow
4491 2018-07-21 20:57:30 Gave myself a deep condition and a hot oil treament my hair feel so soft and silky
4492 2018-07-21 20:57:07 I’ve heard about this today. I’m curious?! I’ve got baby oil but not gel
4493 2018-07-21 20:56:58 Demoing VR pro-tip: I put a tiny drop of lavender essential oil on the border of the headset.
4494 2018-07-21 20:56:47 Guess who’s about to clean their room and pour coconut oil on their entire life..?
4495 2018-07-21 20:56:15 It is! 
4496 2018-07-21 20:56:13 yes the US subsidizes big farm, oil, era etc. that's socialism too. Or welfare if you like
4497 2018-07-21 20:56:01 Four lamb chops - two each - marinated in olive oil - and given a couple of mins on each side on the sizzling hot BBQ. Served pink with the chimichurri 
4498 2018-07-21 20:56:00 If you have oily skin, look for products that contain silica. This ingredient helps to absorb oil. It can hold a large amount of oil and keep it locked away from the skin's surface, preventing blocked pores. #protip
4499 2018-07-21 20:55:55 And about time. They can infiltrate our cyber security. Been tw Congress no avail. They make the parts for our antiquated electrical grids. They hack or shut down and we are in anarchy no gas,food, oil, heat, or internet. And no American Co makes??
4500 2018-07-21 20:55:30 Hey God, why does Germany buy Oil from Russia? And at the same time wants US to pick up the tab for its security?
4501 2018-07-21 20:55:30 Olive oil and cancelled plans: a memoir
4502 2018-07-21 20:55:28 Asked my mom to oil my door hinges and she told me to leave it creaky so she can hear when I’m coming and going 
4503 2018-07-21 20:55:23 • I come back to my first post to grow eyelashes apply coconut oil, argan, castor oils on your eyelashes for ease of growth before going to bed.
• Exfoliate your lips and moisturize them every day 
• Go to bed early, I would say that 10 p.m is perfect. 
4504 2018-07-21 20:55:19 Get the carrot oil out
4505 2018-07-21 20:55:02 I have a sinus infection plugging my ear up since Friday. Resting and getting better. Doing the usual rinsing my sinus etc. Taking oil of oregano 
4506 2018-07-21 20:54:59 Alright. 

Please provide us with your mobile number and expect a feedback from us by resumption of business on Monday.

Thank you.

4510 2018-07-21 20:54:32 I know one thing for sure with CBD oil, it makes my finger nails shinier
4511 2018-07-21 20:54:27 The face oil
4512 2018-07-21 20:54:16 waited 3hrs at toyota for an oil change 
4513 2018-07-21 20:54:07 You might be able to get it at Wal-Mart, just make sure you’re getting 100% oils! Otherwise, a health food store or oil pedaler 
4514 2018-07-21 20:54:06 Getting that oil changed @meinekecarcare
4515 2018-07-21 20:54:02 Pepper soup and somebody decided to pour vegetable oil and palm oil in the pot. 
4516 2018-07-21 20:53:46 I am the bone of my oil.
―――体は油で出来ている
4517 2018-07-21 20:53:44 I hope they do too!! That cbd oil or whatever is legal in Missouri and I think I’m gonna try it.  I’ve had a few people tell me it chills them out and I need that! Lol
4518 2018-07-21 20:53:20 Unlimited Oil Works
4519 2018-07-21 20:53:00 A third of Norwegian workers are employed by the govt. The state operates a gigantic sovereign wealth fund funded by nationalized oil, and its financial assets total 331 percent of its GDP.  state-owned enterprises are worth 87 percent of GDP. the govt owns 59 percent of wealth
4520 2018-07-21 20:52:55 With DT as President the  GDP is about to hit 4%!
3 million jobs created!
300,000 in manufacturing!
Unemployment among black & Hispanic Americans at all time low! 
Tax cuts!
America #1 in oil production!
Military spending highest in many years!
VA reform!
Veterans choice!
4521 2018-07-21 20:52:51 You down for some modelos while we change you’re oil lol
4522 2018-07-21 20:52:49 When America takes 1 million lives in
Iraq for oil - Not terrorism
When Serbs rape muslim women in
Kosovo/Bosnia - Not terrorism
When Russians kill 200,000 chechens
in bombing - not terrorism
When Jews kick out Palestinians and
take their land - Not terrorism
4523 2018-07-21 20:52:39 Does anyone else get a weird satisfaction when they change their oil
4524 2018-07-21 20:52:16 Fucksake man neety oil his throat tae get that down, fuckin sahara special
4525 2018-07-21 20:52:15 Oil pipelines create jobs. People pay taxes. Taxes pay for social programs #simple
4526 2018-07-21 20:52:02 You seen the exchange rate??
I lucky enough to get away alot. 
The sterling against the euro and dollar has crashed this decade.
Why would england impose high taxs when we supply them with oil ,food ,drinking water?.
4527 2018-07-21 20:51:38 Lmao my shits woulda been bald by the next oil change
4528 2018-07-21 20:51:32 The planet faces three unsurmountable challenges: Peak water, peak oil and massive climate change. Civilization is about to begin an inexorable decline due to those three issues anyway.
4529 2018-07-21 20:51:07 Avon skin-so-soft spray-on body oil works wonders for keeping many bugs off one's backside.
4530 2018-07-21 20:51:02 last time I was at a wedding a small child lit his own head on fire with a flaming glob of tiki torch oil, hope this one goes a little better
4531 2018-07-21 20:50:57 U.S. And E.U. Sanctions For Russian Annexation Of Crimea Bankrupted American Oil Industry And Created A Mass Exodus Of Immigrants  From South American Continental Particularly Oil Producing Countries Venezuela
4532 2018-07-21 20:50:14 Baby Oil Gel 
4533 2018-07-21 20:50:00 Does China even produce much oil. Bonus points here are they just made a deal for oil with Saudi Arabia and dropped their contracts with Iran.
4534 2018-07-21 20:49:23 Oil changed, tires rotated. 
4535 2018-07-21 20:49:21 Great idea:  full body oil massage while they play stolen valor vids.
4536 2018-07-21 20:49:18 They all focus on oil at the detriment of other industries that will spread the wealth. Politicians and most civil servants in Nigeria are evil. They now pay few poor people to support their evil deeds on & offline.
4537 2018-07-21 20:49:11 オイルbotって何⁇とよく聞かれますが、…オイルはオイルですYO
4538 2018-07-21 20:49:09 she looks good tho!
4539 2018-07-21 20:49:09 Yes the whole band wears those coveralls, look like mechanics or Oil field workers. It's a cheap version of Elvis?
4540 2018-07-21 20:48:59 He & his party still think they are talking to our grand and great grandparents, politically uninterested easy marks for the red snake oil salesmen of their time. Its they who are uneducated now. This is not the Scotland they counted weighed & boxed away until the next easy pitch
4541 2018-07-21 20:48:55 
4542 2018-07-21 20:48:50 Is your coconut oil cold pressed? How much is it?
4543 2018-07-21 20:48:23 EnerCom, Inc.  @EnerComInc
EnerCom is a consulting firm providing branding, marketing & valuation solutions to oil and gas Companies. One of the Top Management Consulting Firms by Forbes.
4544 2018-07-21 20:48:17 @SecretaryZinke @Potus and the @GOP do not care about the environment, they are in the Big Oil business.
4545 2018-07-21 20:48:16 In case you’ve not noticed it’s us the people of Scotland who are marching and our marches are getting bigger. We are disgusted by you lot,your policies are disgusting. What have you lot done with the oil revenue for over 40 yrs.  hang your heads in shame
4546 2018-07-21 20:48:01 you literally cannot mention the word kathri around my grandma withou ther turing on the stove and getting the oil out
4547 2018-07-21 20:47:58 You hit the nail on the head. Russia’s oil and gas reserves are insufficient to keep them solvent for more than maybe 10 yrs. They need access to our capital markets which will not happen unless they change. We have a straight flush and they are bluffing  with an Ace high.
4548 2018-07-21 20:47:58 I completely agree that that’s a great reason on its own to be a vegan. But I think when it comes to debating non-vegans and making the case for it, almost every argument except animal rights is open to “whataboutisms”: “What we should really do is focus on the oil companies” etc
4549 2018-07-21 20:47:49 Battery is probably a dual battery which has been tested by the FIA and is legal and I doubt there is any oil burning but whatever
4550 2018-07-21 20:47:26 Ka gane kenan.. Amma kaima ai oga na ne.. You no dey crave those things.. Sai irin su chicken kakeyi

4556 2018-07-21 20:46:32 YK worlds largest supplier? Why the fuss about using cannabis oil etc? Using medical marijuana legal in Canada with Dr prescription but costly and can't travel with it.  All sorts of stupid politics around it.
4557 2018-07-21 20:46:13 She's a silly model. I will show you a real navy woman who writes books, is kind, creative, actress, would do anything to help ppl, animals. A friend, have to ask her if ok to post her name.
4558 2018-07-21 20:46:10 Sorta like how full body oil massage is a great way to relax and treat yourself. Paying a sex worker though...

4561 2018-07-21 20:45:43 Battery and oil burning are two I can remember...
4562 2018-07-21 20:45:42 Fucking fuck Hendrix just licked this plant based oil that Collin sprayed on the door hinges and now I’m freaking out 
4563 2018-07-21 20:45:40 Trump didn't accomplish very much with Kim Jung Un did he. Now Trump is being played by Putin while Russia sells oil to North Korea and tells Trump otherwise.

4569 2018-07-21 20:44:17 May we know the branch you visited to make the purchase?
We'll like to confirm this information and get back to you as soon as possible.

We await your response via DM. Thank you.
4570 2018-07-21 20:43:59 Russia had never been top world trader except oil. By cutting American interests from Europe & Asia, Mr Putin has market share that can grow exponentially. We just lose jobs & costs go up for what we no longer manufacture. #PutinsPuppet returned a pile of Rubles with trade war
4571 2018-07-21 20:43:28 Does it count if I was 6 when he was sold and bawled my eyes out when it happened and became a Kings fan until he was traded to St.L then came back to Oil fandom?
4572 2018-07-21 20:43:25 Cook with animal fats, butter, ghee, natural coconut oil and palm oil. Avoid vegetable and cooking oils which are extremely processed #tips
4573 2018-07-21 20:43:25 My mom covered me in Vick’s & rubbing alcohol. She also rubbed St. Anthony holy oil on my forehead! I could go on...
4574 2018-07-21 20:43:13 Bad news: my 3 month old lawn tractor has an oil leak in transaxle. Good news: it is under warr & my daughter's beau is mowing for me.
4575 2018-07-21 20:43:03 It's been the same for me tbh, but apparently monsoon season here can trigger it?? I dunno but I have a good way to deal with it with using an essential oil called Valor, people keep using it at work because stress and anxiety and now I'm almost out of it :(
4576 2018-07-21 20:43:03 Vacation started with burning my hand with 350 degree fryer oil.

4578 2018-07-21 20:42:52 Came to get my tires rotated after my oil change and dude gonna ask why I want em rotated and that they’re fine. Rotate my tires you fuckin con artist.
4579 2018-07-21 20:42:42 Life in Florida, beating the rain to do an oil change #mechanic #gotitdone #tooeasy
4580 2018-07-21 20:42:36 Thank you dear Susan! 
4581 2018-07-21 20:42:33 I literally have to oil my hair everyday!!!! 
4582 2018-07-21 20:42:25 It was extremely bad for our exports. Even when oil prices went super low, our exports didn’t increase. I understand that internationally prices went down for all exports but most of the countries made gains.
4583 2018-07-21 20:42:12 The only good things about coming for oil changes at the agency is the DIY channels lmao.
4584 2018-07-21 20:42:10 I bet long term remissions of mood disorders will be reported going forward. Probably all that’s needed for many is to make a hard stop on man made food. The usual suspects Veg Oil,Sugar, grains top the list.
4585 2018-07-21 20:42:00 catch that boiling oil from the sweaty tent still making its way on my face !
4586 2018-07-21 20:41:49 Depending on the meal, but generally oil,m, salt and pepper, and as many cloves of garlic as I can get away with - everything else is changeable
4587 2018-07-21 20:41:44 They will have to lift some sanctions to really benefit from Russian oil. Though Congress passed sanctions related to election interference that Trump couldn’t veto, the WH still hasn’t put most of those into action. The Crimea/Ukraine and original election ones are.
4588 2018-07-21 20:41:40 Oil tastes like magic
4589 2018-07-21 20:41:40 Them fish oil pills got you geeking fam

4592 2018-07-21 20:41:10 I’m not much of a gamer these days (I’m more of a social gamer and love the soundtracks), so I bought this purely to add to my collection XD! Although I will give it a go, and hopefully get past Oil Ocean Act 2’s boss this time.

4594 2018-07-21 20:40:37 @Oggis Is it possible to order plain whole wheat pasta without any butter/oil/sauce? Any other dishes besides salads that are vegan and oil-free? Many thanks.
4595 2018-07-21 20:40:33 There are no friends in a firestone while getting my oil changed how strange has your day been.
4596 2018-07-21 20:40:29 見回り行ってきまーす！

4600 2018-07-21 20:40:01 sksks shows how much i know, lol. i usually use matrix biolage, but i did a little switch since the coconut oil one was on sale and everyone seems to love it.
4601 2018-07-21 20:39:55 Don't let your hair get into your face while you sleep. The oil from your hair can cause acne.
4602 2018-07-21 20:39:53 DIY body butter:
Note: same amounts of each ingredient 
-coconut oil
-cocoa butter
-olive oil 
-shea butter

-wisk until they are mixed together and at desired texture
4603 2018-07-21 20:39:45 They were like oil and water.  Brought  out the worst in each other fought, definafely. Even his security had to pull her off of him, she threw things at him, grabbed him. But he did not harm that women. They never should have married.  But he did not abuse her
4604 2018-07-21 20:39:45 Ehhbody keep talkin bout only 50k....man niggas get shot over 3.5 of kush and some wookie js. For 50,000 I'll put your ass in an oil barrel in the desert. 
4605 2018-07-21 20:39:36 Congratulations Susan!!

Wishing everyone a MAGA weekend
4606 2018-07-21 20:39:33 Rapeseed oil I have less of a problem with because I know we can digest it. I don't know about high extraction or how to recognise it on a label, so I'll def look that up, thank you.
4607 2018-07-21 20:39:26 Whoever encouraged me to shoot my shot needs to be fried in hot oil absolute tragedy
4608 2018-07-21 20:39:18 うー、原画枚数もうちっと抑えたかった(;´-｀)
4609 2018-07-21 20:39:16 Really need my oil change but my housing complex won’t let me do it in the street and don’t wanna pay someone $60 for it 
4610 2018-07-21 20:39:03 and another...
4611 2018-07-21 20:38:53 Congrats.  I just hit 5000 about 1 min ago.
4612 2018-07-21 20:38:52 & my car fucking up like I didn’t just get an oil change yesterday
4613 2018-07-21 20:38:46 @jheil Trump ups US oil production. Boosts US military spending. Forces NATO to boost spending. Sells lethal arms to Ukraine. Sells missile defense to Poland. Keeps Russian sanctions. Which is good for Putin/Russia? NONE. Talks to Putin. As opposed to, what, launching a war?
4614 2018-07-21 20:38:33 So true. FDR banned gays from the military, did nothing about segregation or Jim Crow laws, or women's equality. FDR got the U.S. permanently involved militarily in the Middle East, and dependent on foreign oil. Plus, he started the Nuclear Age.
4615 2018-07-21 20:38:28 i’ve been using rose hip oil while on accutane and it’s the only thing keeping me from looking gross
4616 2018-07-21 20:38:27 Exfoliation and Monet’s super secret oil.
4617 2018-07-21 20:38:26 Yeah, oil fields are powering their equipment with solar, come to Texas all their equipment on solar. Why? They believe oil & has good right? Bull

4619 2018-07-21 20:37:47 A lady that had a booth at the farmers market saw buzz, & I told her how he was teething. & she says “poor chicken, I have CBD oil to put on his inflamed tooth!” It worked w/in minutes & she gave me a free bottle  good hearted ppl still existing makes my cynical heart melt
4620 2018-07-21 20:37:43 dropping cbd oil under my tongue & hoping for the best
4621 2018-07-21 20:37:42 oil can burn easily, so maybe
4622 2018-07-21 20:37:34 I was picturing hot cheese and bread, but your version is much more daring. I wonder which cocktail pairs best with hot oil?
4623 2018-07-21 20:37:22 Coat your eyelashes and eyebrows with castor oil every night if you want them to grow faster
4624 2018-07-21 20:37:08 DIY lip scrub:
-Honey
-sugar 
-olive oil
-add any flavour that you like for example vanilla or leave it how it is
4625 2018-07-21 20:37:03 Good for them!! It's too bad a country like Canada is going to be so far behind in technology development because of the oil industry. We are losing our status fast!
4626 2018-07-21 20:36:42 i got some oil blotting paper and my conclusions were right i’m: greasy as fuck
4627 2018-07-21 20:36:34 Y’all ready for this shit? A thread:
Ok so I pull up to Honda today for an oil change and I have my mom in my passenger seat. I put the car in park and start to get out when I see this guy I used to hook up with. He approaches my car and I go “hey how you been” (we’re cool).
4628 2018-07-21 20:36:31 Had most Daniel, followed the rest except for @PamelaW76716808 she doesn't seem like a Trump supporter to me.
4629 2018-07-21 20:36:18 DIY hair mask:
-avocado oil
-coconut oil

-nourishing mask that rejuvenates damaged hair!!
4630 2018-07-21 20:35:49 the person that gave me that advice was a professional piercer, i have keloids on my ears but i haven’t tried the tea tree oil yet.
4631 2018-07-21 20:35:48 I’m feeling like such an adult today. I got brand new tires and an oil change. 
4632 2018-07-21 20:35:47 I go to the local international market, they have 100 brands. Soursop is also called graviola, paw paw or guanabana. I get the leaves and grind them into a powder for my smoothie. Or you can put them in your tea. Any black seed oil you get should be organic and cold pressed.
4633 2018-07-21 20:35:39 Russia + China blocked a US proposal to halt all oil shipments to DPRK while we address sanctions violations - citing the need for more proof ( we have pics). Unsurprising. But it is Notable that @USUN @StateDept supportive of such a proposal despite ongoing talks
4634 2018-07-21 20:35:36 you have to leave miley and stand
with tay, hey man you gotta be a stan 
and miley is bringing the oil of tan 
to tay this chick miley is a fan
Tay tay taking the crown
4635 2018-07-21 20:35:30 It was! Microwave a glass jar of honey, add chilli flakes and salt to taste, add a generous spoon of lemon curd, stir and pour over freshly popcorn corn! At uni I would cook popcorn in chilli oil and add salt, that's a great mix!
4636 2018-07-21 20:35:13 You can almost glaze them like oil paints.

4638 2018-07-21 20:35:07 Is climate change the most pressing issue in our time? I thought that was the arguement? And now you argue " to deny underdeveloped nations from exploiting fossil fuels"? So we need to shut down our oil industry to avoid millions of deaths from climate change, but China, India?
4639 2018-07-21 20:34:42 No we still praying
4640 2018-07-21 20:34:38 The baby oil threw me all the way off

4643 2018-07-21 20:33:27 Assuming oil combustion causes climate change, the defendants should be the people and companies who turned the oil into CO2
4644 2018-07-21 20:33:21 I spoke on one of the disadvantages of palm oil and now my babes isn’t talking to me 
4645 2018-07-21 20:33:01 A thought the oil was gon to catch fire I was scared
4646 2018-07-21 20:32:38 Well whatchu you doing, take me already
4647 2018-07-21 20:32:23 I hate the way tea tree oil smells so muc
4648 2018-07-21 20:32:11 Aviation, tourism, mining, agriculture, manufacturing, sport, entertainment are few industries that can help spread wealth among Nigerians & pull people out of poverty. Unfortunately, the few greedy ones among us sat on oil at the detriment of others industries to impoverish US!
4649 2018-07-21 20:31:55 DID YOU KNOW: 

canola oil is only called that because people decided a portmanteau of 'Canada' and 'ola' (for 'oil') is way more appealing than the actual ingredient, 'rapeseed'
4650 2018-07-21 20:31:42 I am just in the mood to eat roasted yam & oil with pepper and ugba .
4651 2018-07-21 20:31:31 how to get healthy//whiter teeth
-eat strawberries
-brush your teeth with baking soda
-try oil pulling*whitens*
-swish a little bit of apple cider vinegar in your mouth *it kills bacteria*
4652 2018-07-21 20:30:51 And the more we find the poorer we get, oil really is a curse !
4653 2018-07-21 20:30:42 I think it was just my oil pump and crankshaft that was bad
4654 2018-07-21 20:30:35 #Shell’s share of total production in #Nigeria was 266,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day last year compared with 258,000 barrels in 2016,“Security issues, sabotage and crude oil theft in the Niger Delta continued to be significant challenges in 2017,” it said in the report.
4655 2018-07-21 20:30:31 I’d make you take the shirt off... but not because of the oil stain...
4656 2018-07-21 20:30:07 Mall chair massage w/CB oil
4657 2018-07-21 20:29:46 Why you gon be like that 
4658 2018-07-21 20:29:38 Go in for a oil change and considering “Black on Black”

4660 2018-07-21 20:29:14 Taking a poll, who has not yet tried CBD Oil?
4661 2018-07-21 20:29:13 Trump is doing everything he can...even releasing US reserves to get the price of gasoline down before midterm elections...cutting off Iran oil has the whole world scrambling.
4662 2018-07-21 20:29:03 Ah, yes! The killer fondue. Introduce hot oil to your dinner party. It's a crowd pleaser! 
4663 2018-07-21 20:28:58 For the balm I just rub it softly over my face and eyes, with the oil I take a cotton pad and place oil on it and put it on my eye for 30 seconds ish and use a q-tip to remove the rest( takes long but it better for your lashes
4664 2018-07-21 20:28:58 It's not like I don't want us to a get a decent winger  - I do! But it'd be like buying luxury oil on a Nissan Micra. We need to sort the back four and work our way forwards.
4665 2018-07-21 20:28:50 I am thinking about using the remaining oil paint to draw something
4666 2018-07-21 20:28:46 I’ll bring the oil haha
4667 2018-07-21 20:28:30 It's a dangerous thing for God to pure oil on an empty head. You become a better minister when there are good informations in your head. Go gain more knowledge. Study books, know something about everything and then study & meditate on the word of God. #DontBeEmpty

4670 2018-07-21 20:28:09 As I understand it the cheapest oil is actually high extraction rape seed, palm oil is used for viscosity and its unusual stability at high temperatures, which must be used in granulating the bouillon. My problem with palm oil is simply rainforest, but I am happy with RSPO
4671 2018-07-21 20:27:54 Oil King brought some really nice stuff to the Menat matchup and had clearly done some prep.

4673 2018-07-21 20:27:36 I gave my mother in law an oil diffuser like mine and she sends me a video of Crixus and Nati (Crixus Cousin)  PASSED OUT 
4674 2018-07-21 20:27:29 #LiesPeopleTellThemselves The (invasion) war in Iraq had absolutely nothing to do with their supply of fossil fuels. I just spent 6 months in the Persian Gulf protecting an oil platform on the taxpayers dime for our freedom. #DropTheMIC
4675 2018-07-21 20:27:29 Le Peak Oil arrivera bien un jour, mais rien que la surface existante de toits en France permettra largement de fournir l'énergie nécessaire grâce aux panneaux photovoltaïques.
4676 2018-07-21 20:27:20 @jiffylube So I pulled into Jiffy Lube to get my oil changed and I’m told that they are out of oil filters so they can’t change my oil.   There is an auto parts store about a quarter-mile away but did they go get an oil filter? No, they sent me to grease monkey OK.
4677 2018-07-21 20:27:14 Says the twat that supports a club run by oil barons and can’t fail to win the PL Everyone can win the league with that money you mug!!!
4678 2018-07-21 20:27:12 True true but its only because the fries are covered in oil, which is high in fat, not because of the potatoes themselves..
4679 2018-07-21 20:27:08 Go coconut oil, its medium chain fatty acids are less likely to be stored as fat by the body.
4680 2018-07-21 20:27:06 Surely food only makes you fat *if* it is digested so it can then be absorbed and ultimately deposited in adipose?  Undigested oil goes straight through you, cf. Castor oil, liquid paraffin.
4681 2018-07-21 20:26:57 abe sutiya, why will pAAP party harm its own self??? It is your DUTY to destroy them, but as i keep saying BJP is a GANDU party, can only complain and do nothing.

on social media, report what you have done, do not cry like a spineless looser.
4682 2018-07-21 20:26:32 This the type of people to ask me where the olive oil is when they on the oil aisle
4683 2018-07-21 20:26:27 Okay, new plug installed.  Old oil drained & replaced with 15 ounces of the fresh, per online specs.  Pretty sure engine's now flooded from being tipped on side, but in an hour or two...  :crossing fingers:
4684 2018-07-21 20:26:05 I use a makeup remover balm - Clinique or a makeup remover that is oil based!!!
4685 2018-07-21 20:25:55 Was sat on the beach today and a group of girls with perf figures next to me were sat putting baby oil on and eating fruit and I'm sat there with my bloated tummy,factor 50 layered on &stuffing my face with a chocolate crêpe  (: fab x
4686 2018-07-21 20:25:38 That’s the way Bill.  Mrs G will be carrying oil similar duties this week whilst I check the caravan out. I spend too much in Savers to be allowed to go myself.
4687 2018-07-21 20:25:37 Has any of my #CRPS or #chronicpain friends tried cannabis oil for pain and who hates taking pain pills as much as I do? I would love to hear feedback on what your experience is/was. Thank you! 
4688 2018-07-21 20:25:28 I still haven’t. But I imagine it’s similar to truffle oil

4696 2018-07-21 20:24:56 A chaque fois qu'on nous a prédit un '"peak oil" ou une quelconque pénurie de matières ça c'est révélé foireux. La réel c'est de comprendre qu'on améliore sans cesse les procédés pour produire le même truc avec moins de ressources (grâce à l'indicateur du prix) ou on trouve autre
4697 2018-07-21 20:24:56 Won't disagree with that. Suspect had the Balkans and Rwanda had oil, our American friends would have been over there in a shot. That we did too little until too late is a lesson we should have learned.
Sadly, Yemen and Syria prove we didn't.
4698 2018-07-21 20:24:54 Hmm tu eres mitgouet ia València está molt condemnat
Pero mira, ara mateix tenim un govern que al menys busca defendrel.

4703 2018-07-21 20:24:33 Dip stick socialists don't quite reach the oil. They can't figure it out, nothing is free. I can not imagine properly educated Americans falling for this cr@p. Problem is, the Federal deep state operates education. Communism assures the STATE gets all the money, not the people.

4720 2018-07-21 20:21:34 So they can squeeze every last drop of oil & natural gas out of every last ocean, rock & grain of sand.
4721 2018-07-21 20:21:12 Cocoa butter is the best or baby oil and never scratch
4722 2018-07-21 20:21:09 It’s going to be a three hour wait until they get to my car for an oil change. 
4723 2018-07-21 20:20:56 he should’ve put brake fluid instead of oil for her. hate customers like that
4724 2018-07-21 20:20:45 fasting, yoga, organic coconut-castor oil hair mask & a gallon of alkaline water.

4725 2018-07-21 20:20:43 Didn’t get tickets but I was so ready to sneak into curl fest today. Was gonna do my hair and look cute and all. Here I am in my bed by 4pm wondering if castor oil will make my eyebrows grow
4726 2018-07-21 20:20:12 هل يوجد فندق 5ستار في البوسنه والهرسك؟
4727 2018-07-21 20:20:11 WOW...I remember when 9/11 happened...it was like that here I ran out of gas multiple times waiting in line. IRAN should NEVER have this problem when they export oil. WHO do the people of Iran want to lead them?
4728 2018-07-21 20:20:09 Beard oil is an essential especially for @DaggerMcTimbers

4732 2018-07-21 20:19:20 If you really think that any policy is better than no policy, I suggest you take a look at some of the notable failures of climate policy, like the original Euro fuel quality directive, which encouraged massive tropical deforestation through support of palm oil biodiesel.
4733 2018-07-21 20:19:18 Castor oil straight up for constipation

4736 2018-07-21 20:18:35 I left my hood 13 yrs ago in an old Honda. Too broke to get the oil changed. Times change.
4737 2018-07-21 20:18:27 Just like the story IT if we look back at the Presidents every 27 years we have Johnson (who some say killed JFK) then we have George W. Bush who took us to war so he could make more money in oil. And now Trump. You’re a wise man @StephenKing Pennywise has taken the form of Trump
4738 2018-07-21 20:18:19 Came to metro Honda to do my oil change and let me just say I rather drive all the way to rock Honda 
4739 2018-07-21 20:18:19 If that man asked me to boil my head in oil I would.  My Hero !
4740 2018-07-21 20:18:03 Is that the one with the gallon of baby oil, and the  .......  never mind
4741 2018-07-21 20:17:56 #Shell has continued to face opposition in the region, with some reports suggesting local people even blocked the company from accessing some parts of the delta for years. This has left Shell with undeveloped oil and gas reserves
4742 2018-07-21 20:17:42 صحيح 
4743 2018-07-21 20:17:41 THIS is awesome.

4746 2018-07-21 20:17:24 I just smothered an entire package of silken tofu fresh out of its tetra pack in sesame oil, soy sauce, sriracha, fresh cut ginger and scallions and now I feel like a fucking queen.

4748 2018-07-21 20:16:54 So they have! That’s naughty and possibly fraudulent! Please PHB take the palm oil free claim down from your website until you can honestly say that you are 100% palm oil free.
4749 2018-07-21 20:16:48 Allah ya taimaka,mun samu qani kuwa ko kanwa?
4750 2018-07-21 20:16:43 He's spending money the club have generated. We're debt free and don't have oil money. There's a difference.
4751 2018-07-21 20:16:36 That would only happen if I had money on Smith, but I don't so that means shogun is fucked.
4752 2018-07-21 20:16:31 Pine oil! I’ll send u to pine oil heaven
4753 2018-07-21 20:16:30 The mushy peas with basil vice mint were well received. The fries, I heated them for 3 minutes at 320 then took them out to hear at a higher temp, had to fry 3 times. Wife loved them but I wish I had the oil temp right the 2nd time. Fish was cooked. Breading kinda flimsy though.

4758 2018-07-21 20:15:48 I put some biofreeze on and took some CBD oil. If it doesn't settle down, I'll throw some ibuprofen at it.
4759 2018-07-21 20:15:39 When asked for what kind of oil I wanted I fucking said oil oh my god lmfaoooooo I should honestly just stay home
4760 2018-07-21 20:15:38 oh, also, if you ARE going to eat them right away, it's good to sprinkle grated cheddar on top of each potato before you put them back in the oven. also ALSO, if you want to get really fancy, you can mix a seasoning salt with some olive oil and paint each potato skin with it.
4761 2018-07-21 20:15:33 Is this one completely oil only?
4762 2018-07-21 20:15:21 Ayyargh what of Amarya?

4766 2018-07-21 20:14:52 Economically Russia is weak. They have oil, arms, and hookers. 

Not sure we need any of that?

4768 2018-07-21 20:14:28 Paid $600 for a maintenance plan at @SubaruCustCare @subaru_usa in Schaumburg, IL that only covers oil changes. Aka ‘over priced oil change only plan that you’re paying 2.9 percent interest on until the car loan is paid off’ PS:cheaper to buy oil changes individually #ComeOnMan

4775 2018-07-21 20:12:45 I went olive oil taste testing and the lady deadass made me eat olive oil with a spoon and no bread......
4776 2018-07-21 20:12:41 My '14 Civic had an oil leak at the breather cover with 45K miles. Tech tried to tell me oil leaks aren't covered under warranty. I showed him a screen shot of the actual warranty showing it was. They covered it and for some reason he doesn't work there anymore.
4777 2018-07-21 20:12:30 Lol over sure dey worry me na

4781 2018-07-21 20:12:06 All the media's hysteria isn't helping. Russia is doing on-seas oil transfers to NK against sanctions. A better relationship between @realDonaldTrump & Putin might allow Trump to pressure Putin into stopping, which helps paralyze North Korea. You twits don't think past your nose.
4782 2018-07-21 20:11:59 Watoh da kaji kiran sallah saika ajiye mike ka basu sallah, I get it.

4784 2018-07-21 20:11:18 Did I mention I’m working today...and have written up 20+ oil changes exactly how my scenario suggested?!?
4785 2018-07-21 20:11:18 At the ARB workshop last week, experts noted that movement in this space is going faster than expected. We’ll see a lot of attacks from oil and gas interests on electric vehicles and proponents. Can’t get distracted by the noise. #LaserFocus
4786 2018-07-21 20:11:04 Leaving for vacation tomorrow. About to co-officiate a wedding, still need to pack, make kids pack, get oil changed etc. Half done with tomorrow’s sermon. Sat down at my desk and searched, “What is the most underrated Judas Priest song?”
4787 2018-07-21 20:11:03 nice one.
4788 2018-07-21 20:11:02 Everytime I get an oil change I be wanting to just get on somebody highway and floor my shit

4796 2018-07-21 20:09:58 -Rose oil is great for inflammation so I can imagine tea would be great. Hope it helps!
4797 2018-07-21 20:09:49 Lucky you.  I’ve never had the pleasure, but I know of others that have had weird experiences too.

I’d be making friends with somebody at a nearby church and have them come over to pray or put holy oil on my doorways or something.

That stuff freaks me out.
4798 2018-07-21 20:09:48 That's  why he has eliminated all the environmental  protections  Obama put in place.  Literally he's taking us back 50 yrs. Now lead in our water, oil spills in the ocean, asbestos poisonig, coal ash in lakes, is okay because EPA records and test results are being destroyed.
4799 2018-07-21 20:09:43 Lol this one doesn't know life ooo just imagine d stupidity in the tweet,well I can't relate for now,I'll know when I get married.

4802 2018-07-21 20:09:34 I hate mother effers that wait until the last minute to get an oil change...on a Saturday...no appointment...expect itnin 30 minutes with wash and vacuum....and have a coupon for $19.95 that expired in 2016. IJS. Broke asses. Or sometimes, we call them students. 
4803 2018-07-21 20:09:24 Nexxus shampoo/conditioner has been doing it for me..

4808 2018-07-21 20:08:21 An hour wait for an oil change at Walmart in wford.
4809 2018-07-21 20:08:21 I'd turn it around & say Texans would support Marx's idea of community self-rule, dissolution of the state, an end to exploitative capitalism & community control of resources, direct democracy etc. Unfortunately,oil made it a hot-spot for vile capitalists to exploit Texan workers
4810 2018-07-21 20:08:10 @ROHL_Official Do NOT recommend!!! So disappointed in my "top of the line" faucet with a "living" oil rubbed finish.  It is dead!  Just rubbed off.  Terrible.   Not a great faucet. 
4811 2018-07-21 20:08:07 There should be a word for the products in your medicine cabinet that you can’t bring yourself to throw out and you can’t wait to finish. Mine often involve tea tree oil.
4812 2018-07-21 20:07:30 all the best. May you succeed with the speed of light and force of force of pralaya.
4813 2018-07-21 20:07:28 I’ve been saying for a long time that Republican’s live by the mantra, “I’ve got mine, F you!”.  I find agreement in your opinion about not believing in obvious science such a climate change.  But besides that, the coal (“I love coal”) and oil industries stand influences many.
4814 2018-07-21 20:07:18 He armed Ukraine so they wouldn’t cooperate with the Mueller investigation.  The original sanctions were Obama’s, Trump waited 6 months to implement the latest sanctions, the Russians mercenaries attacked one of the 11 oil refineries US military are guarding in Syria.
4815 2018-07-21 20:07:13 It’s a fact that women cannot play competitive games at any skill rating. Women don’t have the brain cells to work well with men. It’s like oil and water. Stick to Maple Story and Animal Crossing. Competitive is for us men, sweetie. They made Arcade mode to cater people like you.
4816 2018-07-21 20:07:10 How about a small number Phyrexian Agents appearing on planes they shouldn’t be on, perhaps via limited use portal tech. Maybe perfecting the portals before the Praetors come through. Or adapting the glistening oil to the magic of a new plane. Our heroes discover/thwart them.

4820 2018-07-21 20:06:16 just walked into an auto shop to get an oil change for my van in my hometown and the mechanic just said “oh you’re ‘cold beaches hot bitches’ right?”
4821 2018-07-21 20:06:07 Oga not everyone is like u oooo...
4822 2018-07-21 20:06:06 It actually didn’t. The Ackroyd case you cited did not do that and is being appealed anyway. There are others in the pipeline. Trust me, it is hihgly complex and fluid. PS I won’t claim to understand oil importing or lecture you about it. Deal?
4823 2018-07-21 20:05:51 I’ve just been an emotional mess lately. My fault for forgetting to take me evening primrose oil :(

4827 2018-07-21 20:05:23 Had no idea Curl Fest was today...  City bout to be lathered in Coconut Oil....  im here for it
4828 2018-07-21 20:05:22 Yes!! Definitely tried. Some of it is SO powerful! I sampled a few drops of a hemp CBD oil at a vitamin shop and felt it heavily. Really interesting. I just recently bought CBD flower that I'm really enjoying.

4833 2018-07-21 20:04:36 So I had acne scars on my cheeks and I use witch hazel, then tea tree oil and then sometimes at night before bed I put bio oil and that’s used for scars and stretch marks and they lightened so much, even the witch hazel and tea tree oil works bomb I feel like
4834 2018-07-21 20:04:27 The guys that benefited from the fraudulent $25b oil contract are looking for where to invest their corrupt money. Very soon you will hear that they have raised the money.
4835 2018-07-21 20:04:26 Coconut oil is the best idc what anyone says
4836 2018-07-21 20:04:24 Ingenuity, where oil based machines and monopolies thrive off doing the same thing by making cheap products you have to buy over and over. Ingenuity at its finest.
4837 2018-07-21 20:04:15 My night time routine is quite... tiring actually lolz.

3) toner
4) essence
5) serum
6) moisturiser
7) body cream/oil

4838 2018-07-21 20:04:10 Bro what’s wrong with Monday
4839 2018-07-21 20:04:09 I was all “organic” this am... blue toothed meditations to my record player, sat back in a softly lit room, drank green tea w/coconut oil, & contemplated detoxing all day...
Ended up eating CapNCrunchberries & a PBNJ. Welp.
4840 2018-07-21 20:04:03 I use it + coconut oil+ honey + olive oil for hot oil treatment. Treatmenr makes hair grow and  more manageable. I also apply on my hairline daily.
4841 2018-07-21 20:04:03 So insufferable. I once went to my car dealer for free oil chanfe they offered when I bought it in Jan. How about a sales manager came out to give me a sales pitch despite owning that car for only a few months. Uh? Why would I need another auto loan. why would I trade?
4842 2018-07-21 20:04:00 What's inconceivable is that a president in 2018 would want to destroy our environment with orders for deregulating the oil and gas industry, seizure of public lands & oil drilling off pristine coasts. I don't care who you sleep with, but I do care about the air we breathe.
4843 2018-07-21 20:03:58 Poor girl! Sweet almond oil may be an option.
4844 2018-07-21 20:03:54 mayo is okay but i prefer the vegan hellman’s kind or just using hummus on sandwiches instead. in coleslaw-terms i prefer oil & vinegar
4845 2018-07-21 20:03:29 This white bitch making a scene cause the guy charged her $30 for a oil change instead of $22

4858 2018-07-21 20:01:08 that's so true, climate change denial has absolutely nothing to do with the share price of Oil companies

4860 2018-07-21 20:01:04 Fun fact: My high school communication class teacher had a bit part in this movie and he told me that guy actually drank that can of motor oil (not gas). You can see him in another scene later drinking some alka seltzer in the background.

4862 2018-07-21 20:00:40 yea I have combo skin as well but I found that when I’m super dry I can use a matte primer but add a TINY amount of an essential oil to my face (I like rose hip oil) before applying the primer. Foundation shades are tricky at first so just try as many as u can until u find tha #1

4866 2018-07-21 20:00:20 #Shell discovered #oil in the Niger Delta in the 1950s and became among the biggest producers in the West African nation. Tensions between the company and the local people broke out over the years regarding pollution and Shell’s contribution to civil society

4869 2018-07-21 20:00:06 Interesting morning at the car dealer while waiting for my oil change.   definitely made me smile by the time i left, then some random gentleman paid for my lunch. I appreciate the random acts of kindness today.

4873 2018-07-21 19:58:31 The CEO of Chick-fil-A, his arm clad in the purest shimmering peanut oil, held aloft a nugget from the bag of paper, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry a lifetime all-you-can-eat pass. THAT is why I am your king.
4874 2018-07-21 19:57:46 So how much do you charge for brakes, pads and oil for my car?

4878 2018-07-21 19:57:19 Is that even possible? Can they even provide all the oil China needs? Please...
4879 2018-07-21 19:57:12 Is it just me or does every white family ask their child if they’ve been checking the oil in their car
4880 2018-07-21 19:57:12 Well 3 more hours changing the oil in Satan’s fucking gooch and I’ll be home
4881 2018-07-21 19:56:53 You’re almost correct, @realDonaldTrump , my favorite President,  BARACK OBAMA, has done nothing wrong! You, on the other hand, have done nothing right. You old  snake oil salesman! Move to Russia where you belong! And take Melania and your children with you!
4882 2018-07-21 19:56:41 well yeah, they should, Yet being protected by zukernerd though, huh you lead tainted snake oil salesman? #1a #tcot #tlot
4883 2018-07-21 19:56:33 No doubt. I drink it every day, with MCT oil & cacao butter added.
4884 2018-07-21 19:56:33 What’s the difference between paste and oil in regards to potency and the way it is used and what it is used for ?
4885 2018-07-21 19:56:21 Miles! Nothing he said or did was treasonous, my friend...look up ‘treason.’ He has been tough on Russia, expelled diplomats for spying, closed an embassy, increased our gas & oil shipments to Europe invading THEIR territory... shall we talk?
4886 2018-07-21 19:56:15 you gotta get the cracked pepper and olive oil ones
4887 2018-07-21 19:55:49 Didn't think shale was associated with Permian oil.
4888 2018-07-21 19:55:37 Turmeric lemon juice and olive oil. Make into and oily paste let sit for a good 10-12 minutes do it 2-3 times a week should be gone 2nd week
4889 2018-07-21 19:55:31 It's time for an oil change again... -.-
4890 2018-07-21 19:55:29 The only people not supporting this have an interest in oil and gas
4891 2018-07-21 19:55:05 Obasanjo is a corrupt leader, Danjuma is try to protect his oil block , Youths are lazy and there are not ready to work, Northern leaders are shedding crocodile tears ! Then, who will support Buhari to win 2nd term bid ? Can Buhari get votes from North like 1st term ?
4892 2018-07-21 19:54:58 • I recommend going to a dermatologist to actually find out what is going on with your skin. 
• DO NOT use lemon on your face, it is not good for your skin and it can cause irritation 
• Apply Vitamin E oil or Vitamin C serum after washing your face.
4893 2018-07-21 19:54:48 Olive Oil for hair... Love it...

Hair feels much soft...

Cold press...
4894 2018-07-21 19:54:47 Related to large oil/gas trucks, near a refinery maybe?

4897 2018-07-21 19:54:12 My moms having one of those days so everyone in the family is taking shelter. I ran out and got an oil change and my dads been hiding in the bathroom for the past hour
4898 2018-07-21 19:54:11 Nearly 85% of Canadian corporations are American owned. All the oil companies and refineries. As a major example of ex Canadian companies Tim Hortons. Oh yeah, French's ketchup too. WTF is Trump complaining about. The USA is sucking our teet dry while we have dire poverty. Awaken
4899 2018-07-21 19:53:56 Nope, it's actually because of the discovery of crude oil deposits underneath Lake Malawi. The oil has the potential of 100+ years of supply at above 100, 000 barrels per year..according to 2016 report.
4900 2018-07-21 19:53:55 Yes it does have monoi oil.  The scent is really yummy especially for coffee lovers.  It is not too sweet nor heavy for the senses.
So proud (if I may say so) of what we achieved with this .
Such a hit in Dubai
4901 2018-07-21 19:53:47 I miss my vw, she was low maintenance af. Real rider. This boujie bih got me out here being taxed on tires, oil change and acts up when I skip a car wash.
4902 2018-07-21 19:53:36 Yes, you mix them in one container. I don't really measure but make sure the glycerine is more than the spirit and tissue oil. It's better when it's a thick paste.
4903 2018-07-21 19:53:28 I've only tried Starbucks Coffee once and I'm pretty sure that the girl who gave it to me just saved the old oil from her last car change and slipped that to me for $5 >XP you'd think at that price she would have at least put in the cream and sugar herself.
4904 2018-07-21 19:53:24 face oil, sayang. boleh, kok.
4905 2018-07-21 19:53:22 Sliced bread, some olive oil on it, garlic (can be powdered) and thyme and bbq those for a bit == heaven or === heaven (in javascript).

4910 2018-07-21 19:52:35 Hard ugly fact that these countries were beginning to emerge from third world status.Begining to provide a better life for their children.Politics of power,oil and control prompted regime change as it continues today!NATO bombings have prolonged the suffering

4918 2018-07-21 19:51:38 Reported yesterday, a barrel of oil is below 70 dollars a barrel and gas is 2 cents less this weekend. Has anyone seen a real price decrease since the high of 74 dollars a barrel?
4919 2018-07-21 19:51:24 Ye unfortunately enough Norway cant get rights from the arabians. We have to much oil, and they only want gold

4921 2018-07-21 19:51:08 I spilt oil in front of my oven and now I’m craving juice. This is classical conditioning at its finest. Today it’s juice, tomorrow it’s world destruction.
4922 2018-07-21 19:50:49 Whether we have to deal with Duplicitous Don another 2 weeks,  2 yrs or 6 yrs, there will be an end to him. What will linger, is the mass amounts of people in the United States, who have sold out to a snake oil salesman.

4924 2018-07-21 19:50:35 When my bones creak I just take a shot of JD to oil them up  as long as we're still enjoying what we do we'll be fine

4929 2018-07-21 19:50:01 Why even Mr trump telling other countries not to buy iran'oil that is not right  he is the one who walk away from the agreements, listening to corrupted nethynyaho, not the iraninas,or maybe he wants a war to save himself&GOP dead as usual,but war with iran may lead to 3rdww.
4930 2018-07-21 19:49:59 Yes Butter, real wholesome butter, none of these spready things made from Olive oil or sun flower oil, real butter. made out the same stuff as Cream 
4931 2018-07-21 19:49:54 I got an oil change for free today too. Today’s been good so far 
4932 2018-07-21 19:49:49 try CBD oil, if you haven’t already. It helps with the pain without the intense high from the THC. Check it out!
4933 2018-07-21 19:49:37 Ok wait- the Spotify event yesterday looks so pretty and there was AN ESSENTIAL OIL STATION
4934 2018-07-21 19:49:25 Sure to the extent he did. 
Trump wants out of Syria. 
It can not be done without Russian collaboration.
Trump wants elimination of ISIS
He needs Russian collaboration. 
Trump wants International oil price agreement with Russia
He needs Russian collaboration. 
North Korea etc.
4935 2018-07-21 19:49:18 Why can’t all the Arabs leave , and move to Arabia : we have oil , camels , dates , milk , honey , oasis , deserts, the most beautiful culture ever , best food , most beautiful women ( don’t let em drive please ).They can have their country and live their own lives !

4938 2018-07-21 19:49:08 Duncan Hines brownie mixes (and most of their other mixes and frostings) are dairy free. I highly recommend using coconut oil in place of vegetable oil and then add some sea salt. They come out amazing.
4939 2018-07-21 19:49:02 It’s oil change time. The CLA also got a new air filter today.
4940 2018-07-21 19:48:56 Human nature allows these snake oil salesmen to prosper.  Hope, desperation, and the counterintuitive nature of probabilistic thinking are factors
4941 2018-07-21 19:48:51 The notion comes from the top down. Putting environmentally responsible regs costs $$ for many segments of big business, for which they lobby congress to stymie. Oil, coal, know that leaving a smaller footprint with alternative energy sources will affect their pocketbooks.
4942 2018-07-21 19:48:49 Oil on board?
4943 2018-07-21 19:48:48 Oil change , 4 new tires , car wash ...who am I!!!

4948 2018-07-21 19:48:30 “But it might help. Additional options might help them feel better. And the placebo effect! And they’re still getting the real treatment!” It’s just a way of peddling snake oil to people who wouldn’t go to an alternative treatment center, but might go to a joint treatment center.
4949 2018-07-21 19:48:08 My mascara is made w cannabis oil and bitch might just get some in her eye 
4950 2018-07-21 19:47:57 Finished getting an oil change rn and even my mechanic asked me "where's paco at?", I really do take him with me everywhere
4951 2018-07-21 19:47:45 But yet Americans are paying the most for oil products one might start to wonder why
4952 2018-07-21 19:47:42 A shoebox oot in the sticks, to be built by a loon from Alford  (if his company gets past the JR and if he can squeeze £50M out of the DNA gullabillies / uber supporters ). If your jibe about moving here for the oil is aimed at me laddie, your way off target.

4954 2018-07-21 19:47:10 Sigmas looking for kitty milk while we outchea looking for Omega oil...
4955 2018-07-21 19:46:54 Well, no. It’s not mysogyny/ propoganda. Substitute Bill or Obama if you like.  The focus is mechanism: spending fueledd by increased economic growth while not standing up to the major institutions eg. Wall street/ oil/ military which perpetuate inequality/ provide revenue.
4956 2018-07-21 19:46:40 It's oil, it's wheat, it's soil, it's meat, it's beef!
4957 2018-07-21 19:46:38 Yep. Source said lots of people rent out places and are rarely even there. Oil $, Middle Eastern tycoons, etc
4958 2018-07-21 19:46:06 Plus he has no risk of it being turned against him, what with living off shilling snake oil + alimony from his far more successful ex wife
4959 2018-07-21 19:46:03 Me declaro fanatica de lo dulce 
4960 2018-07-21 19:45:53 Some secrets to share on that... Must spread olive oil evenly on the entire pan...
4961 2018-07-21 19:45:48 I get it now. We had to invade Iraq to get the oil to make the gasoline to justify the expense of the gas stations we’re building in Afghanistan. Now if only anyone in Afghanistan could afford a car...
4962 2018-07-21 19:45:40 Yes! You’ll want to spray your plants with a Neem oil solution every 10 days! 1 1/2 tbsp of 100% Neem oil + 1/2 tbsp of castile soap mixed in 8 quarts of water. Spray your plants aggressively in the evening.
4963 2018-07-21 19:45:29 Holy crap. Bobby Santos, who won the Eastern Propane & Oil 100, sounds almost exactly like @celebrityhottub.
4964 2018-07-21 19:45:28 I'm just not sure being covered in oil is actually very attractive in most cases.
4965 2018-07-21 19:45:22 Drawn it in oil and put it on a pizza before the oven.
4966 2018-07-21 19:45:15 Topslice...but hold some.
4967 2018-07-21 19:45:13 I guess that plastic, nylon, makeup, propane, natural gas and all of those other things that have only been around since the oil refining don't come from fossil fuels either?
4968 2018-07-21 19:45:09 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
4969 2018-07-21 19:45:03 No oil wells in Tel Aviv, can't help you.

4987 2018-07-21 19:40:56 my issue with palm oil is I understand it's difficult for us to digest, leading to obesity. Also, I know it's the cheapest fat possible, I'm annoyed manufacturers are cutting costs but not passing them on to us, so I feel swindled when something contains palm oil.
4988 2018-07-21 19:40:53 oil
4989 2018-07-21 19:40:48 No. Doesn’t mean jokes can’t be made. I mean there’s jokes about oil spills, assault, murder, and the holocaust...

4993 2018-07-21 19:40:37 like the variables that determine the price of oil - it's never one thing entirely.

4996 2018-07-21 19:40:31 LOL. Don't you know anything about human nature? Between the end yrs of oil & good ol' partying, we should have no problem with energy alternatives in fairly short order.
4997 2018-07-21 19:40:30 Britain is far and away IRE biggest trading partner, accounting for 50 per cent of exports, Rep IRE is virtually entirely dependent upon its larger neighbour for energy, importing 90 per cent of its oil and more than 90 per cent of its gas from the UK
4998 2018-07-21 19:40:26 Next time I'm doing this, idk why I thought I'd be fine with just the oil lmao

5011 2018-07-21 19:39:00 Just like the AWPR lots of twats complaining and delaying what needs to be done but it is going ahead, there should be a greater good council of Aberdonians who decide what is best for Aberdeen not Twats from England who moved up for the oil
5012 2018-07-21 19:38:57 My look dry but it be nice and oily. Brown hair look dry anyway how much oil you put in your hair.
5013 2018-07-21 19:38:55 I just found a dollar on the ground and I reacted like I’d struck oil #blessed
5014 2018-07-21 19:38:47 Confirm especially this oil perfume
5015 2018-07-21 19:38:44 Too much bonging and banging and not enough binging I think
5016 2018-07-21 19:38:37 Let me know if it works :-) you could also try a little olive oil that shouldn’t hurt you or coconut oil
5017 2018-07-21 19:38:30 I could set an American flag on fire every day, toss it off the overpass into traffic, where it gets run over by a 100 cars that leak oil, EVERY GODDAMN DAY I could do this, and I would not be disrespecting this country as much as Trump and his flunkies are doing right now.
5018 2018-07-21 19:38:27 Thanks. I'm not a fan of head highs & the long lasting oil "relief" made me high for hours, I hated it lol. 

I'm discovering the vape, though harsh, is the right amount of helpful.  I'm happy for you, as well. :)
5019 2018-07-21 19:38:26 $10 might be a low price to feed a family, but if they are on a low wage for whatever reason, proportionally, then the price will be an issue. Also, I've tried some of the $10 promo recipes, and they assume you already have a bottle of olive oil (expensive) for example.
5020 2018-07-21 19:38:20 Difference is we do not need the Oil sands. And as you may have noticed in 2014-15, Qc and On didn't suffer at all. Diversifying your economy is key. I'd prefer Alberta would invest in value added industries. But hey, not my business. You do as you please.
5021 2018-07-21 19:38:19 Transmission oil 
5022 2018-07-21 19:37:56 Olive oil, coconut oil, shea butter stuff like that natural products
5023 2018-07-21 19:37:52 The guy is a snake oil salesman, not the next savior, so please stop your defense. He’s a big boy can defend himself 
5024 2018-07-21 19:37:48 Coconut oil , Keemi oil & Nivea lotion for extra moisture in my hair.
5025 2018-07-21 19:37:41 I just cut one, sprinkled with salt & cracked pepper and put on bread w/olive oil! Yum!
5026 2018-07-21 19:37:33 Stingy girl,u decided to go alone ,and left me
5027 2018-07-21 19:37:29 Argan oil and instead of using shampoo do apple cider vinegar rinse (YouTube a tutorial)
5028 2018-07-21 19:37:05 That’s right. Little bottles with very pale olive oil from Boots. We drank cod liver oil! Euuugghh
5029 2018-07-21 19:36:56 If my car didn’t need an oil change hellaz bad I was going to :/
5030 2018-07-21 19:36:56 the great thing abt baby courgette is the texture. Lightly fried in olive oil then mixed w/whatever is for suppe it makes a wonderful light and crunchy substitute for carbs
5031 2018-07-21 19:36:52 teu apal bu hajjah, sugan qatar..da asa loba org indo di oil company ditu.

5032 2018-07-21 19:36:44 Look at fracking. Good for the US economy, better than oil for climate change & cheaper nat gas for consumers. But Energy Co’s are dishonest about effects on where they frack. Is the only way to do something in aggregate good that harms *anyone* to mislead?
5033 2018-07-21 19:36:39 And Russian mobsters who are called Oligarchs now. The key is  which translates into #Oil so you have to factor in melting the Arctic & the ME
5034 2018-07-21 19:36:32 I don’t see it as any different in principle to oil in Scotland. The government can’t charge for the oil, they probably issue licenses for the extraction and tax on the amount extracted?
5035 2018-07-21 19:36:26 i need an oil change. Don’t feel like waiting tho 
5036 2018-07-21 19:36:25 dear B&BW, bring back true blue spa monoi oil pwease

5040 2018-07-21 19:36:01 name equal keep oil differ provide d2c9
5041 2018-07-21 19:36:00 Made with  corn syrup solids and hydrogenated vegetable oil?
I'll stick with actual cream from an actual cow. No chemicals for me.
5042 2018-07-21 19:35:55 I drown my hair in coconut oil until it feels wet.
5043 2018-07-21 19:35:42 I'm sorry this will sound wrong too you, but Oil Sands aren't anything to be proud of. I prefer we import cleaner oil from Algeria and the UK than contributing to mess an important part of our country. Besides, pipelines leak and can cause environmental disasters.
5044 2018-07-21 19:35:34 Yeahhh for some people it's fine but bc it's such a heavy oil and the skin on the face is rly delicate it makes a lot of people break out so it's generally not recommended. Your skin always looks really good tho!!
5045 2018-07-21 19:35:06 Man really said 13 minutes like he was digging for oil. Poor girl
5046 2018-07-21 19:34:46 Your aware that Russia has it's own oil. Aren't you? In fact they have quite a bit being exported. They don't need us for any of that. Don't forget they already have 20% of our uranium deposits. Thanks to the Dems. That's your real collusion!
5047 2018-07-21 19:34:34 You guys know WD-40 is just olive oil and windex
5048 2018-07-21 19:34:31 Glass bottle containing milky white anointing oil.
5049 2018-07-21 19:34:22 vape oil. Please I must see
5050 2018-07-21 19:33:48 Have you tried CBD oil? They make some with zero thc (doesn’t get you high) I’ve heard great things about it for anxiety
5051 2018-07-21 19:33:27 I wouldn't be surprised if someone actually tries to drink motor oil
5052 2018-07-21 19:33:07 Rather stick my penis in boiling oil than meet that cry baby 
5053 2018-07-21 19:32:54 My favorite president didn’t do anything wrong. OBAMA.  You are a snake oil salesman. RESIGN.
5054 2018-07-21 19:32:45 That’s a subjective metric. If judged on his actions along with promises made & kept...Obummer was a snake oil salesman. The funniest thing out there right now is Mr Obama claiming to be scandal-free..while allowing HEZBOLLAH to peddle drugs, among other ‘lies’.
5055 2018-07-21 19:32:42 Not only I was going to other stores looking for non farm raised salmon, which I finally did at Whole Foods. I couldn't find Oil of Olay moisturizer that is fragrance free that I regularly use. I think the company sent the stores the wrong stuff bc the box doesn't say FF. Grr
5056 2018-07-21 19:32:40 We use synthetic blend because real oil is good for old seals
5057 2018-07-21 19:32:36 Oil Prices
Higher pump prices are especially painful if you drive more and earn less than average, which is more common in RED states.The average red-state driver bought almost a fifth more gas than the average Blue-state driver in 2017, paying for it out of disposable income
5058 2018-07-21 19:32:35 Herbal oil.
5059 2018-07-21 19:32:19 Nikki. Read Julian Simon - the preeminent economist who has debunked this.

Oil wasn't a resource till we found a use for it and created the technology to drill it and refine it. It's our thinking which turns dirt in the Earth to resources.

It's reason that's the resource.
5060 2018-07-21 19:31:56 i swear by the Acure Radically Rejuvenating cleansing cream!! also not skin care or makeup but Acure’s argan oil and pumpkin shampoo/conditioner smells amazing
5061 2018-07-21 19:31:45 With a name like bongers what do you think???? ;)
5062 2018-07-21 19:31:26 I am weeping laughing in the middle of a car service place waiting to get my oil changed and they’re all looking at me funny but this is so true I cannot locate a fuck
5063 2018-07-21 19:31:25 That's awesome!! ^_^ For haircare, what's your hair type? And budget? Personally, I use shampoo and conditioner from Giovanni, leave in conditioner from Eva NYC, dry shampoo from Amika and a scalp oil treatment from Activist skincare.
5064 2018-07-21 19:31:25 How incredibly smarmy.  Were I within 5 feet of them, I wouldn't have to oil the chain of my bike.
5065 2018-07-21 19:31:21 Bill 1 in this session of the Legislature was literally the Energy Diversification Act. They’re spending billions to build out the downstream (value-added) portion of the oil&gas sector. And they’re using carbon tax money to support diversification outside oil and gas. Be patient
5066 2018-07-21 19:31:15 President Nïcholas maduro has messed up Venezuela good. Inflation ïs crippling the economy. Migrants, all internal lake marakabo are polluted by oïl the crisis is at brink point Pray for venezuela its collapsing @UNCTADKituyi

5068 2018-07-21 19:30:05 Oh, wouldn’t it be nice to try oil paints one day? Primed canvas, tubes of aluminum and decals!
5069 2018-07-21 19:29:57 Highlight to them that the period when most orders for the A330-900neo coincided with the period of the lowest oil prices when a barel reached in the $30s (Clue: the A330-800neo ordered by Uganda is the more fuel efficient now that oil is at  $67 a barrel)
5070 2018-07-21 19:29:47 Hands down, Accord and Farmers Oil have the prettiest trucks driving down the road.
5071 2018-07-21 19:29:47 CBD oil is my only best purchase
5072 2018-07-21 19:29:43 The government, and big oil have a vested interest in $Tesla failing. @elonmusk has absolutely no chance at pumping money into the corrupt government the way big oil is. It's a landslide. So Tesla literally has to win the hearts and minds of its customers. It has to be superior.
5073 2018-07-21 19:29:41 No into tinting mate. Brown. Light brown and grey . Braw beard do some great smelling oils. If u don’t use them the beard is dry. Special shampoo is good but need butter or oil.  It’s a Tranent company.

5077 2018-07-21 19:29:06 Aren't we paying the nations like Saudi Arabia who harbored terrorists and Al Queda camps and ISIS and most of the 911 pilots came from billions of dollars for oil or did you lose your oil tykes globe again, like when you left them off the travel ban.....

5080 2018-07-21 19:28:29 I laughed so hard reading that article about the oil market that it made me cry, my contact lens fell off, and my dog almost ate it.
5081 2018-07-21 19:28:09 it seems that the environmentalists have settled on the alberta oil sands as a prime target they just keep on interfering too many  groups have to get a piece of the pie example tides paid a indian chief to protest in Ottawa how did 5 fires start at the same time around fort mac?
5082 2018-07-21 19:28:01 I think more important than strain is your timing.  You should fall to sleep when you are coming down.  So I would find an indica oil your heart can tolerate and take it about 4hrs prior to when you want to sleep. Note I'm not a doctor, just saying what works for me.
5083 2018-07-21 19:27:57 Yes I agree tanks don’t run on propaganda they need oil... Army group North should’ve held while the armor pushed south.

5086 2018-07-21 19:27:21 I can now say I’ve fried plantain in bra & pant like the memes & the hot oil has not spluttered onto my skin.
5087 2018-07-21 19:27:18 mored about @Disney firing James Gunn for a comment he made a decade ago. This overreaction to social justice wombat campaigns to ruin people's lives has reached the level of insanity. What next, banning canola oil for promoting rape(seed)? #fukdisney

5092 2018-07-21 19:26:18 I bought a big pile of little baby yellow summer squash at the farmer's market, now I have to figure out something to do that's NOT grilling or sauteeing in olive oil.

5094 2018-07-21 19:26:08 gr8 my mom used one of the old jar thingies i used to make slimes in MONTHS ago to put porridge and now im suffering with this laundry detergent essential oil taste
5095 2018-07-21 19:26:01 tonys chattanooga really good pasta John, but the fresh baked bread with the roasted garlic in the crust with the fresh virgin olive oil dip is the star of the table. Rhonda and I stop every time we are in Chatt. It is up high on the point so a beautiful dusk view of the river.

5104 2018-07-21 19:24:53 Ford and Moe plan to fight the tax in court. They will lose, but this is beyond the control of the federal gov't. The tax will reduce emissions, and development of tar sands has been curtailed by low oil prices. That's not projected to change.
5105 2018-07-21 19:24:39 Millions of people eat . Ever heard of a chicken shortage? Forestry firms manage their plots v well.

Is there more coal,oil, tin etc today with 7 billion people than there was with 3 billion? Yes. Why?

Cos the only resource that creates others is our mind and it's scarce.
5106 2018-07-21 19:24:30 Bought jojoba (which is apparently pronounced ho-ho-ba???) oil for my hair and ended up making a DIY face scrub eith brown sugar and lavender essential oil. It's so great. Loving this natural shit
5107 2018-07-21 19:24:18 I got an oil change, a hair cut and I bought Fenty liquid liner so I think this Saturday is very productive and fulfilling so far

5109 2018-07-21 19:23:32 I double cleanse at night only and I have dry/dehydrated skin. My first cleanse is always an oil cleanser and my second is always a gentle gel cleanser. Nothing striping or harsh! I also do not cleanse my skin in the AM. I just wipe down with a micellar water in the AM.
5110 2018-07-21 19:23:27 Bought the jamaican castor oil...now i can stop applying because it smells so good. 2. Im trying to see something with them edges Zitakua zimemea by tomorrow?

5116 2018-07-21 19:22:52 Danny becoming worst. He knows how to put oil in burning issues.
5117 2018-07-21 19:22:51 Really want some oil down.
5118 2018-07-21 19:22:49 An oil change only should take like 30 minutes. Maybe be there an hour tops
5119 2018-07-21 19:22:36  same thing happened with my catahoula 2 week’s ago. she started limping and I immediately stopped the walk and went home with her, but it was too late :( her back paws were burnt like hell, I cried and rubbed coconut oil all over her lol she’s recovering well from it though.
5120 2018-07-21 19:22:26 Ready made flour, you just add Eggs and oil. Mix and put in microwave for 30min max,  done.

5122 2018-07-21 19:22:19 Does cbd oil really help with depression and anxiety?
5123 2018-07-21 19:21:59 I have an opinion. Grow up and deal with it. We didn’t get cannabis legal so they can sell some shitty oil as medicine. Plenty of real CBD oil you can purchase from dispensary.
5124 2018-07-21 19:21:54 I’ll do my best. Been practicing my “hello ladies “ and have a towel and baby oil in the car.
5125 2018-07-21 19:21:52 I never "chop" since, if u change oil, make me do wheel balancing na....

5131 2018-07-21 19:21:13 Heavy reliance on oil based products as evidenced by the amount of plastic shown in this photo.  A bit hypocritical.

5133 2018-07-21 19:20:58 Not certain the price or how the market works but if opec can for all intent and purpose control oil prices why cant the American farmer with our grains?   Bushel of wheat for a barrel of oil sounds about right.   We have our own oil.  Grains wont grow well in the desert
5134 2018-07-21 19:20:54 It's true, in your emotional state, just don't want to accept it. Also President Trump armed Ukraine, attacked Russia's economy by selling oil in Europe, sanctioned Russia;s oligarchs, had Mattis destroy Russian mercenaries in Syria & rebuked Merkle for buying energy from Russia.

5136 2018-07-21 19:20:34 Yep, it's powdered. You simmer it with a bit of oil & add broth if desired.

This is on a whole other plane than the Doñia María ones. (Better by far even than Café Poca Cosa.)

It's made locally in Tucson, we found it at that great bakery/store at the north end of 4th Ave. :)

5139 2018-07-21 19:19:59 THE BAD: I wore an oil stained t-shirt to a consultation with a potential new client by accident. 

THE GOOD: the oil stains are from coconut oil so I can use that to prove that I’m really about my shit.

5193 2018-07-21 19:12:23 I asked my dad was the ‘extra virgin’ in olive oil meant. he said it meant that the olives never get pollinated. 
5194 2018-07-21 19:12:22 My point is that saying they get the water for free simply not true. And they’re not depleting our water table so describing it as extractive is not accurate either. It’s not coal or oil.
5195 2018-07-21 19:12:14 Nothing is naturally buttery, these kids just have a bunch of oil cause they use too much conditioner

The Cooked meals today also had it so no sleep. Hopefully tomorrow it wont be the same. #Adams
5207 2018-07-21 19:10:58 That's really cool. I had another haunt in a hotel in Paris. Dad got to travel and he took us sometimes to Europe on Oil business. But that suit in a hotel was haunted. I felt a shake under my bed on my butt and it did it over and over and then in the closet there was scratching.
5208 2018-07-21 19:10:44 Alberta has been supporting provinces like Quebec for decades with the profits of Oil. Time for Alberta to stop equalization payments to these welfare provinces . If they have to they will work out a deal with USA and screw the rest of Canada and I wouldn’t blame them 1bit.

5217 2018-07-21 19:10:14 let us sale coal extraction  plant into oil refinery . we supply coal they get all the fuel they need at lower cost than RUSSIA. i will build it and america can supply it with all the coal they need. that is a win - win for both of our countries.
5218 2018-07-21 19:10:09 Your right! They and China want to have their currency as the only currency in the world to buy oil. They both cannot be trusted. And Russia and China conduct military training together.

5231 2018-07-21 19:08:54 I definitely think Trump could have had a tougher stance when he was at that press conference w/Putin. But I look at the whole picture.

5235 2018-07-21 19:08:24 We manage our oil n gas as it belongs to Sabah!
5236 2018-07-21 19:08:17 I disagree. @RachelNotley may not have given a speech about it yet but her government is taking many of the steps necessary to prepare us for peak demand (diversification, training, infrastructure spending, incentives to decarbonize our oil so we can retain access to markets etc)

5239 2018-07-21 19:07:23 Interesting, I was under the impression the oil helped all types of epilepsy. That's what happens when I don't thoroughly research a topic. I guess it is true in my case, a little knowledge is dangerous. Have to get the book, sure a real eye opener. Be well.

5263 2018-07-21 19:03:53 That's a stupid rule. In a modern engine properly maintained of course 100 k is nothing. Uber being discriminatory.

5275 2018-07-21 19:02:21 .Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!
5276 2018-07-21 19:02:09 Oil and Gas kini kó Steel business is highly underrated Indians and Lebanese know more than we do. They are the gurus in this sector
5277 2018-07-21 19:02:08 Independence would be spectacularly bad for Scotland, but I know many Scots may not see it that way. The EU would absolutely insist on the oil and fishing rights just to consider Scotland joining
5278 2018-07-21 19:01:38 love me some body oil 
5279 2018-07-21 19:01:30 I put coconut oil on my body tho hips down...it breaks my back, chest & face out.
5280 2018-07-21 19:01:29 I just pushed out a gram of hash oil out of my pipe, and suddenly I have a reason to live...
5281 2018-07-21 19:01:25 Secrecy of aliens has almost nothing to do with ET's, &everything to do w/ fact that we no longer need oil w/ what they're hiding
5282 2018-07-21 19:01:21 The woman last night took a really long time to prepare my burger so I am assuming she had to change over the oil. My hands mostly smelled like onion and a little bit like the actual burger haha

5285 2018-07-21 19:00:46 Stir together 3 pints cookies with 4 tsps Italian bread. Add generous amounts of Olive Oil. Chill.  Serve on a bed of pasta
5286 2018-07-21 19:00:36 The problem is he’s a snake oil salesman, just like you.
5287 2018-07-21 19:00:32 Scaffie is well used but never geggie to my recollection, first time I heard it I was in my mid 20's on an oil rig
5288 2018-07-21 19:00:32 Sounded like he blew up and teammate Bryan Dauzat spun in the oil.
5289 2018-07-21 19:00:30 @sterlinghelp Hello,do you still have the electronic saving box? (Kolo) some of your marketers brought to my office some weeks ago
5290 2018-07-21 19:00:29 I swear by tea tree oil. Coconut oil didn’t work for me but some ppl can use it and I heard it works
5291 2018-07-21 19:00:25 I use coconut oil on skin and hair. Cucumber slices on eyes for short naps, hydrate.

Of course, I’m not an extremely handsome dude (@thecadencelux can co-sign this)

But there they go
5292 2018-07-21 19:00:21 50 years! What a snake oil salesman

5294 2018-07-21 19:00:18 Thank God Trump is a strong president with a solid sense of fairness! Thank God he has applied the appropriate leverage to get NATO countries to contribute more! Thank God he has the guts to call out Germany’s oil deal (blackmail)w Russia & corrupt corporate cronyism!

5301 2018-07-21 18:59:35 You have to be just plain stupid to complain about foreign intervention in elections and advocate for letting foreign nationals vote at the same time.
5302 2018-07-21 18:59:11 Finally getting an oil change.
5303 2018-07-21 18:59:11 It’s the effect of last-ditch lobbying by the oil industry.

‘Make buses suck’ is their tagline, to force people back into cars & buy expensive, polluting petrol, to stop the ‘sunset industry’ share dive as divestment kicks in.

Or something.

5316 2018-07-21 18:57:40 You know its warm when your coconut oil is a liquidy mess !!

@thebodycoach

5317 2018-07-21 18:57:36 Why no oil? Lots of oils are vegan
5318 2018-07-21 18:57:31 Favourite beauty tips would probably be: proper sleep, hydration, and coconut oil for both hair and body use

5327 2018-07-21 18:56:10 I’m your age and that was when unions got most workers livable wages, the 1% paid more of a fair share of taxes and under democratic administrations home ownership rose. Under every republican admin., wages dropped, ownership dropped, oil soared, unions dropped, tuition soared.
5328 2018-07-21 18:56:04 it's ok Warren, I enjoy hearing about CBD oil and how it help people.
5329 2018-07-21 18:55:58 I remember smoking joints dipped in THC oil...I was high for like 3 days straight

5337 2018-07-21 18:54:03 How illegal? If you mean the oil spec, it reduced the scheduked power. The 2 CE are for Ferrari.
5338 2018-07-21 18:53:55 Just wait until you meet my alter-ego and heir to an opulent European oil fortune, Chromeo Mazzerati.
5339 2018-07-21 18:53:54 No question that demand for oil will decrease, and some even think within 7 years. However, Notley has not presented any real, executable ideas, nor has @SMandel_AB or Kenney. But then politicians are not really known for long term planning, but dealing with current issues.
5340 2018-07-21 18:53:48 Where are they based
5341 2018-07-21 18:53:34 The A330-900neo has had better fortunes because airlines lost interest in better fuel economy technology when oil prices plummeted to about  $30 a barel a few years ago
5342 2018-07-21 18:53:24 @jasonnash @DavidDobrik The Koch Brothers don’t own Coca Cola   They own Koch industries which deals in oil refinery
5343 2018-07-21 18:53:12 I had that happen to a cat I had many years ago, & was told to use two drops of food grade Castor oil, three times a day.  It worked, better than the ointment RX.  Check the internet for verification.  The best to you.
5344 2018-07-21 18:53:01 Well first of all, why would the writing on the pump all be in english? Only top officials are allowed the luxury of owning cars, its an impoverished dictatorship and third gasoline and oil are under heavy sanctions there they don't have gas stations like western countries
5345 2018-07-21 18:52:36 Replacing one addiction for another. Won’t be long before your knitting. Just messing with you, I applaud the effort. It’s not easy. Anyways research CBD oil. It definitely would help you.
5346 2018-07-21 18:52:23 Replace belt. It doesn’t have to stretch much to skid. Belts R cheap.
Get a lil flashlight, a skewer & chopstick, a bottle of machine oil (zoom or gun oil, not WD40 or 3-in-1). Unscrew upper housing. Pick out ALL fluff & goo on main shaft. (Wipe on paper towels).
5347 2018-07-21 18:52:17 Face oil is the best highlighter.

5352 2018-07-21 18:51:52 PSA: tea tree essential oil should never be applied directly to anything on your body! Even to treat bug bites, put a few drops into a carrier oil (like coconut, olive, avocado).
5353 2018-07-21 18:50:55 Nigeria is cursed with bad leaders,they r not interested because it doesn't affect how oil money is shared so don't expect it,since 2012 the port harcourt airport which is by far cheaper to construct has been left in ruins,then imagine if anybody would touch the ports

5371 2018-07-21 18:48:24 <15% is when that tiny gut begins to go away and the stomach starts to flatten. Getting cut, being ripped, and sustaining that is the hard part IMO.

<15% can be achieved by eliminating the trash (no vegetable oil, limiting sugar). Then, things get hard.
5372 2018-07-21 18:48:22 What matters this time is peace not oil and money. See what the population demands.

5381 2018-07-21 18:47:40 Interesting development focusing on a cleaner environment where oil production work is in operation.Despite the potency inherent in this agency, it is sufficient to note that the shady practices by IOCs that damage our environs not the lack of NOSDRA but compromises by gov agents

5383 2018-07-21 18:47:32 It annoys me that in the Two Towers movie that Rohan didn't have a single ballista, trebuchet, fire pot, or even a catapult at Helms Deep. Not even burning oil. For a place meant to withstand siege they were really dumb.

5394 2018-07-21 18:46:04 And remember, before Tillerson got fired (because he wouldn’t join in the Russian sanction lifting for oil, like trump thought an Exxon man would) Congress allotted tons of money for counter action. Not. One. Penny. Spent.

5433 2018-07-21 18:41:19 Well, if they constantly change why suggest that there is fault to blame?
You may be unaware that our State budget is based almost solely on oil revenues and we have labored mightily as a result of years of dropping prices.
5434 2018-07-21 18:41:18 I forgot I was wearing any oil until I got in the car and everyone was looking at me and said I smell really good
5435 2018-07-21 18:41:10 Which yeye UBA? That debited me #3000 for maintenance,as if it a car that changes engine oil every month...
5436 2018-07-21 18:41:09 
5437 2018-07-21 18:41:08 It's clearly missing the point, they seem to miss that their development for 50 years was subsidized by the federal govt and funded by Quebec and Ontario. Alberta got subsidies to develop oil for decades. And when in 10-20 years the oil really crashes, we'll still be there.

5449 2018-07-21 18:40:07 So reminded by seeing coconut oil in the shop, I can confirm a coconut is not a nut but a drupe. 

Also thought of another nut that isn't a nut - a ginger nut.

5501 2018-07-21 18:34:52 The Right's solution to every fiscal spending equation is to make more poor people and let them fend for themselves while we spend trillions of dollars on weapons and wars over oil.

5506 2018-07-21 18:33:55 I agree. Unfortunately, something as simple as a sales tax would be political suicide in Alberta. This province will get off the oil tit kicking and screaming.

5518 2018-07-21 18:32:26 I am disgusted but not surprised. The earth is on fire and the @GOP cannot wait to get their hands on that sweet, sweet oil. Soulless ghouls.
5519 2018-07-21 18:32:07 Bear in mind, it is a vanity project just like the obscenely priced SGR and "first heated oil pipeline in the world" people stroke the old chap's ego for their enrichment. He'll agree to anything as long as one kisses his ass, however foolhardy. Tiring

5530 2018-07-21 18:28:52 Onne port in rivers state is for oil and gas cargoes,if an importer of let's say toothpick,imports from there,he shall be charged the same price oil and gas cargoes are charged which is very high,hence the cheaper option is lagos
5531 2018-07-21 18:28:50 The A330-900neo has a 30-seat advantage over the A330-800neo ordered by Uganda.  Fuel-efficient technology has been around for some time but Airlines lost interest in favour of more seats & cargo space when the price of oil plummeted. Fortunes of the models explained

5539 2018-07-21 18:27:28 So let me get this straight:

Trump armed Ukraine, attacked Russias economy by selling oil/LNG in Europe, sanctioned Putin Oligarchs, had Mattis “annihilate” Russian mercenaries in Syria & rebuked Merkle for buying 35% of Germanys energy from Putin.

But Trump is a pawn of Putin?

5555 2018-07-21 18:25:03 We squeeze as much as we can from the existing industry. Which is why we’re building TMX. And we make ourselves better positioned than other heavy oil producers to sell into markets like China with increasing emissions standards. That’s why the NDP introduced the CCIR (google it)

5559 2018-07-21 18:24:36 Yes, but not all coconut oil is equal. Virgin coconut oil is better than refined coconut oil, because the process of refinement turns some of the fatty acids into unhealthy trans fatty acids.

5563 2018-07-21 18:23:59 I remember one of IMF's conditions was to restrict our country from funding the invention and/or distribution of alternative energy sources that directly competes with oil products. Why that guy who invented that device that makes cars run on water never saw the light of day.
5564 2018-07-21 18:23:41 Oil is a world-wide commodity, no matter if the US is restricting purchases from Russia or not.
5565 2018-07-21 18:23:34 Trump is an up in your face down & dirty character, a person who campaigned as an outsider, a non politician, a businessman! I say Donald Trump is nothing more than a snake oil demagogue! He doesn’t make deals he makes sales & cheats the buyer!

5568 2018-07-21 18:23:17 One thing I dread the most and push off is going to get an oil change. I don’t know what it is about it that I just hate.  at least I’m going to get it done today
5569 2018-07-21 18:22:56 I have to keep correcting this. The oil is just another drug that works very well on a particular form of epilepsy. But for the vast majority of forms, it does little. So yes, if you have that form, use the oil, prescribed by a neurologist. But it is not a miracle cure.
5570 2018-07-21 18:22:31 I changed my brake pads, rotors, and oil today. How you been?
5571 2018-07-21 18:22:27 الولد الجاى ان شاء الله
5572 2018-07-21 18:22:27 Red oil kills red stew. Red oil is meant strictly for traditional stews like Okra. Da ya shiga jan miya ya kasheta.

5574 2018-07-21 18:22:25 Yes it did. It gave he wealthy massive tax cuts & created more poverty level jobs without healthcare for the middle-class. How the economy is doing depends on where you lay the measuing rod. The middle class tax cuts are going to oil companies as artificially inflated gas prices.
5575 2018-07-21 18:22:22 I hate coming to get an oil change

5578 2018-07-21 18:21:46 Gas won't be $4/gallon if the market is flooded with Russian oil.
5579 2018-07-21 18:21:32 He's wrong about soybean oil though. It tastes horrible in pie crusts...
5580 2018-07-21 18:21:29 @Asamoh_ So Nigerians were screwed by their own Black leaders?Nigerian Wealth Oil & Gas etc is benefiting foreigners as usual.
5581 2018-07-21 18:21:09 Water woes started a long time ago. Oil naturally migrated 100’s km. to near surface some 50 million years ago; then was naturally biodegraded by near surface bacteria at <80deg C reducing it to low visc oil only to be eroded by today’s rivers. You should be begging for clean-up!
5582 2018-07-21 18:21:08 Gargle with warm water and salt. Add to a cup of hot water mix apple cider vinegar, cinnamon, and lemon and drink as a tea. If you have an essential oil diffuser put 5-7 drops of peppermint or tea tree oil to help with any decongestant.
5583 2018-07-21 18:21:07 Oh, okay. That's interesting. Another way to see things.

Ultimately we need something that works on lesser power to fit in well with green/renewable energy. Can't run on coal and crude oil forever now can we? We can save the latter for the armed forces instead.
5584 2018-07-21 18:21:00 McFaul is naive.  Ask Donnie to get Vlad to start pumping more oil to lower prices while you are at it.
5585 2018-07-21 18:20:52 I want to see if marijuana oil would help my insomnia any.  I can't smoke it - the only time I smoked it, I had my first asthma attack.
5586 2018-07-21 18:20:49 and you my dear xx
5587 2018-07-21 18:20:39 That’s oil so her nails don’t be ashy
5588 2018-07-21 18:20:21 Sort of reminds me of the days of the snake oil salesman who would pull up his wagon, drop down a background, and con people out of their money.
5589 2018-07-21 18:20:18 Bellisima! Have a lovely evening
5590 2018-07-21 18:20:10 I would say the worst part of adulting is waiting around while your oil gets changed..just my opinion

5592 2018-07-21 18:19:39 Unintended consequences. It's always important to know the full story. Like buying synthetic fur being made of oil that has it's own issues instead of fur. #ItsComplicated #SciComm
5593 2018-07-21 18:19:21 Today, don't forget to buy engine oil.
5594 2018-07-21 18:19:13 Stop wearing braids that are too tight.
I recommend cutting your hair.
Apply castor oil before you sleep  (mix it le hairfood to avoid the smell)

5596 2018-07-21 18:18:53 Im concerned about the outcome of rice cooked to the directions provided by meal services like blue Apron. Tip: add only enough water to skim the top of rice, when it boils add a tbsp of olive oil & mix before covering & reducing to low heat. Otherwise its gotta just be mush????
5597 2018-07-21 18:18:50 Thanks! My dog has seizures (terrible) and is on 3 different meds. Seeing a new Vet next week who recommends CBD oil. Pretty excited that I may be able to get him off from these horrible meds!
5598 2018-07-21 18:18:47 Capitalistic greed hoarding oil wealth is and has been the problem in Venezuela. Not social democracy. There’s a long history of capitalistic greed destroying democracy in the Americas from before the banana wars to present.

5600 2018-07-21 18:18:23 So why is CBD oil extracted from hemp classified as a controlled schedule 1 drug when it doesn't have THC in it? Is that to prevent business from selling product containing THC Free CBD oils so that big pharma can consume that product? There aren't drugs in it?
5601 2018-07-21 18:18:18 Somebody please explain how to cook hash browns with no oil or butter.  How do they “brown” without it?
I’ve been reading a vegan website and it’s depressing me.

5605 2018-07-21 18:17:06 What's that about Putin and North Korea and oil not backing up Trump on Wednesday at the United Nations?
5606 2018-07-21 18:17:05 Oh no Rachel! You don’t happen to have a pipe tobacco smoker anywhere near? My husband can cure a wasp sting with pipe oil. It works every time.
5607 2018-07-21 18:17:00 Unintended consequences follow from almost everything humans do. #Windturbines, a great idea in theory, are in practice, unsightly, kill #birds & #bats, create annoying (maybe harmful) low frequency noise, leak oil, catch fire, & topple over. Cure is worse than the disease.

5626 2018-07-21 18:14:23 Cherry picking McPresident. The US oil companies are extracting Canadian oil and paying around $8 a barrel. Only one of many ways Canada is exploited by America. We are keeping the USA rich and fat.
5627 2018-07-21 18:14:14 I can't relate. i have father but we like water and oil. 

Maaf aku iri :(
5628 2018-07-21 18:14:03 The best way to finally put an end to ocerseas dependency upon its oil is for us to simply break away & become an independent oil producing nation. 

Guess what folks! That's the direction we're heading toward now, and it's already evolving. 

Screw the OPEC!
5629 2018-07-21 18:13:53 The cool thing about getting your oil changed @PenskeToyotaWC is that you can binge watch the whole original Star Wars trilogy, the prequel trilogy, all seasons of The Clone Wars, Rebels, The Force Awakens, AND The Last Jedi as you wait.
5630 2018-07-21 18:13:50 Because Putin wants a stronger US military. The US as the number 1 oil producer, a US GDP growth of almost 5 , a stronger US economy, an isolated Iran all things Putin wants ? Nope. Obama gave him the opposite " flexibility " open mic , sold uranium to him , propped Iran .

I never said it didn't.
So let's see if I get your point. It is, Screw you, Alaska and your people for letting the oil companies in.
Trust me, we've been paying penance for decades.
5638 2018-07-21 18:12:26 nope disagree.....i think...in my opinion....decent oil flows overall...2p
5639 2018-07-21 18:12:18 a lot of it will depend on what state u r in. I personally dont use it, but my daughter has used it for seizures, it works better w/out side affects of the pharmaceutical drugs the neurologist wanted her 2 take. U can type in CBD oil and see what's available in ur state or online
5640 2018-07-21 18:12:01 I just told you.  The massive tax breaks for oil and gas for 70 years as an example
5641 2018-07-21 18:11:24 Safety rules which actually work in the oil patch sponsored by Democrats.  That will be the day.  Another hot air blast of BS.

5653 2018-07-21 18:10:06 Soda water or tonic water have both helped me. Soda water is good because there's no taste. I've also used peppermint oil capsules, but obviously if it clashes with any meds you're on, give it a miss. Good luck. Hope you find a solution.

5691 2018-07-21 18:03:34 Oh yes, you bought your olive oil from Boots or Timothy Whites. I’m maybe wrong, but I don’t think it existed in Tesco or Sainsbury’s.
5692 2018-07-21 18:03:33 It's pushed from the top down. Oil companies, who support conservatives, are some of the most valuable in the world, and most of their value is in the development rights to new sources, which will become worthless if we address climate change.
5693 2018-07-21 18:03:10 No, you can’t be serious. Putin & Assad are friends & has always propped him up b4 Obama. US has always been in proxy wars w/Russia. Trump gave Putin a heads up before bombing. Putin wants sanctions lifted so he can drill 4 oil, Trump’s his man. Trump may get a kickback out of it

5696 2018-07-21 18:02:30 Yes it would- and the fact that the US has been taking the steps to undermine Russia's oil, coal, and LPG production is a very big deal. In the US obviously we don't do the whole state fuel companies thing so the gov't role is (de)regulation with private entities building ports.

5707 2018-07-21 18:00:15 RT @LivingSafely: Brominated vegetable oil ("BVO") in your sodas this July? This flame retardant can be used to prevent separation.

5712 2018-07-21 17:59:16 Watoh shi Mustafa came with his sallaya and kept it close to d podium,you're really angry @angry_ustaaz 
5713 2018-07-21 17:59:13 Olive oil went in your ears not your mouth in my childhood. What a waste!
5714 2018-07-21 17:58:46 Friends don’t let friends use truffle oil.
5715 2018-07-21 17:58:46 Perhaps a garlicky tomato concasse, deseed skinned toms, chop small, pop in a pan with a gently crushed clove of garlic  and 1 bay leaf, cover with good olive oil, bring to heat until the first blup, remove from heat and let sit until cool, remove garlic and bay, spoon over and
5716 2018-07-21 17:58:45 So I mix sugar with almond oil? Haha thanks
5717 2018-07-21 17:58:42 Soursop is used for preventing and fighting cancer. You can use the pills, powder, leaves, or find the actual fruit. And both soursop and black seed oil help with digestion, inflammation, allergies, joint pains, hair, nails, skin and much more.
5718 2018-07-21 17:58:33 Not for oil but other stuff.
5719 2018-07-21 17:58:32 But my favorite moisturizers are by philosophy and joise maran - that argan oil is the truth 
5720 2018-07-21 17:58:24 Long $HAL, $FCX & $COG into earnings next week.  Both $HAL & $COG should have done well in Q2 with rise in oil and nat gas.  Nat gas has been weak of late.  $FCX is value play; as #copper is very weak and #gold chart horrible this year.
5721 2018-07-21 17:58:02 Jalantah oil moal?
5722 2018-07-21 17:57:55 Louie why do you believe the gorilla cum essential oil peddler on good faith...

5727 2018-07-21 17:57:08 This Argain Oil making my hair look short af more and more everyday 
5728 2018-07-21 17:56:49 But we've been reassured that Trump's middle eastern friends will produce more oil to lower the price of gasoline, just because they like him so.

5730 2018-07-21 17:56:21 Help, my wife has inexplicably taken an interest in coconut oil, which makes the house stink to high heaven when she cooks with it (and which I also hear is pretty unhealthy)
5731 2018-07-21 17:55:54 So, yeah, I think that CBD oil helped!  I was so dizzy last night at bedtime, and used some drops.  Right when I woke up this morning I was fine, went and got mani/pedi.  No dizziness.  Hmm....
5732 2018-07-21 17:55:44 Loool. 
Mk we see pishur na
5733 2018-07-21 17:55:40 เวทีลุกเป็นไฟ
5734 2018-07-21 17:55:37 I’m all for enhancing your beauty in whatever way you want. Mix whatever oil with whatever seeds. The moment you decide to make a profit off it, your shit needs standardization.
5735 2018-07-21 17:55:27 CBD oil will do you just fine, it just has to be strong enough bby. tincture works too.
5736 2018-07-21 17:55:22 It's a bizarre thing to say.... especially in the context it doesn't make sense - is the "kool-aid" meant to be oil..? In which case that doesn't bode well for anybody....
5737 2018-07-21 17:55:10 wish i could have an iv of lavender oil
5738 2018-07-21 17:55:05 Q re TrumPutin:  How does a snake oil salesman get so easily suckered by a snake?

#WhosUrVladdy
5739 2018-07-21 17:54:44 Not afraid. In bed with. Trump Tower Moscow, oil deals, Ivanka's business, whatever assorted deals we don't know about. It's always about money with Trump.
5740 2018-07-21 17:54:38 Paani: "tip tip"
Me, afraid with tears in my eyes : "Don't say that. Milk is nothing compared to you. You da state of matter with no shape but a definite volume."
Paani: "tip tip"
Me: "Oil can be a bitch sometimes."
Paani: "tip tip"
Me:"ugh,There's no arguing with you."

Olive oilさん 優しかったあー 
5742 2018-07-21 17:54:31 Better use oil or cream.....thats more soothing. 
5743 2018-07-21 17:54:20 OMG. Guess who has cradle cap!  I was super anxious after you brought it up, so I did some research, and put Coconut Oil on it.  Now it looks like a scaley mess all over her head!  It WAS just her hairline!
5744 2018-07-21 17:54:20 Trader Joe’s and Costco both have good dairy-free chocolate chips, and TJ’s brownie mix is dairy free if you swap canola or coconut oil for the butter.
5745 2018-07-21 17:54:17 once the curtain is raised and the oil sludge settles. I only see nightmares these days.  who can sleep it’s time to wake up. The orange shit for brains is operating totally outside the govt.- as he has no need for it
5746 2018-07-21 17:54:06 Tea tree oil is the mf key to clear skin your welcome ;)
5747 2018-07-21 17:54:05 don't you break even on the interval though? my Honda wants an oil change every 7500 miles. also: i accidentally topped it off with two quarts of 0W20 synthetic because my co-worker was all like "i don't need this, here" and i didn't look at the jug at all until it was empty

5754 2018-07-21 17:52:54 恋ですね………恋なんだよ………
5755 2018-07-21 17:52:48 Actions like arming Ukraine, expanding sanctions, closing the Russian consulate in Seattle, expelling 60 Russian intelligence operatives, encouraging Germany to stop buying Russian oil and gas and stationing 3000 U.S. Marines in Finland, and killing 300+ Russians in Syria?
5756 2018-07-21 17:52:44 Young Living makes a massage oil called Ortho sport Massage oil. If I were you I would choose thing since it has a lot of the essential oils for pain already in it!
5757 2018-07-21 17:52:35 Oh massively. We used to have lettuce, tomato, cucumber and beetroot with salad cream.
We couldn’t dress a salad if our lives depended on it. 
I didn’t taste olive oil until about 1989 
5758 2018-07-21 17:52:24 I have never made a roux before...this one has turned out to be a mess of clumpy lumpiness rather than an actual sauce of any kind. I think I failed to properly heat the oil before trying to add in the flour
5759 2018-07-21 17:52:09 How does it feel to know your doing your part in making America no longer dependent on foreign oil...?

Keep pumping!
5760 2018-07-21 17:51:53 Im at Walmart getting an oil change and the guy waiting to get one after me is complaining how about they’re faster at firestone. uhm then go to firestone idiot

5782 2018-07-21 17:50:11 China has already submitted an offer, the chief negotiator said, “no way, we want more farm and oil & gas products purchased, and we demand protection of intellectual property”; we can always go to India.

5789 2018-07-21 17:48:35 I've been eyeing this gouache set for the past couple of months but like...I've barely touched my acrylics and I have yet to use my oil set

why am I like this
5790 2018-07-21 17:48:32 With the technology we have now it seems to me we could create a way to travel that didn't involve oil in anyway. We're killing our planet.
5791 2018-07-21 17:48:22 My skin will never look as good as it did when i used to put pure raspberry oil on it everyday and use cleanser made from pearls...who has that kind of money these days
5792 2018-07-21 17:48:19 Man who wears trousers in a relationship, can't wash trousers.  You see that evidenced by the overalls worn by the chap on the far left of the line up photo at Horse Hill the other day.
5793 2018-07-21 17:48:16 My humidifier/air filter/essential oil diffuser just got here and I’m so excited I want to go to bed right now.
5794 2018-07-21 17:48:01 Changed my oil and now my baby runnin strong again 
5795 2018-07-21 17:47:59 if what you are saying was true than they shouldn't have supported the attacks in Aleppo, Daraa and Deir Ezzor, Russia will not leave the oil fields and in the end the SDF will collapse, it is just a matter of time and US will withdraw leaving them to face the consequences
5796 2018-07-21 17:47:55 Right! Russia needs to sell more oil.
5797 2018-07-21 17:47:54 That man is a shameless snake oil salesman. Absolutely shameless. Thank you @krishgm for being one of the very few to hold truth to power.
5798 2018-07-21 17:47:53 Please don’t joke with me.... A whole you, all the oil money

5802 2018-07-21 17:47:35 Energy is complicated. Russia is the 2nd largest oil producer in the world. Already we have allies asking the US for waivers on Iranian oil because they are such a large producer for Asia. That said, it would be a good way for the EU + Trump to punish Russia for interference..
5803 2018-07-21 17:47:29 but the oil companies make more with this new efed up kind of system
5804 2018-07-21 17:47:14 Mint, oil, tomato purée, garlic, cumin, coriander, cardamom, salt, pepper, lemon, ras el hanout, all spice and leave it marinate overnight.

5807 2018-07-21 17:46:52 This man came up to me while I was switching oil out in this car talking about  “Don’t get your pretty hands dirty.” Knowing my ass I had to make a smart ass riposte and say “Look here you ugly ass mf, my ass wouldn’t be working here if I didn’t want shit all over my hands” Smfh
5808 2018-07-21 17:46:52 Chef McElroy cut up some acne, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a fine cut of beef, along with hot sauce.

5810 2018-07-21 17:46:45 why is this oil meme going around

5813 2018-07-21 17:46:14 Silly article.  This is what happens when academics write about subjects driven by personal beliefs.  KSA cannot produce oil at less than $9/bbl and it just shows how little this person knows about the fully loaded cost structure of crude prod.

5824 2018-07-21 17:45:00 This is a super swanky place. Lots of oil executives have penthouses there and are rarely there, know that much. I know the person is currently employed as someone currently with admin, slight chance Trump org, but not Trump hotels. Most certain it is admin.
5825 2018-07-21 17:44:49 Good thing my car that gets 30 MPG some times but 40 other times. So who does this help his oil stock and everyone else that have it. NOT HELPING THE MIDDLE CLASS the ones who drive to work & pay for it.  A lot of unkept promises but who see it. His base thinks he walks on water

5827 2018-07-21 17:44:43 This tweet is full of misstatements. NATO is funded by all member countries as you no doubt know. That the US contributes more $$ related to its ability to. That the EU imports Russian oil does not violate sanctions. I would like if they import less but energy is complicated...
5828 2018-07-21 17:44:43 I feel obligated to come bc I’m under warranty but they give me more problems each time. One time I got in my car and all the lights on my dash were on and they were trying to tell me I had a bad battery, but yet nothing was wrong until they gave me an oil change

5845 2018-07-21 17:42:01 The pipeline was for perfectly social reasons, you know that. That's a nimby problem. And he was right. Same with the drilling off Alaska... There's an environmental problem with oil a really bad one. In 2010 it was a delay following the BP disaster, etc...

5881 2018-07-21 17:38:15 How about this conspiracy theory? The GOP are deliberately upping reliance on fossil fuels, and expensive steel is a part of that plan: Companies will move from steel to plastics ASAP. The oil industry is lobbying to ease Russian sanctions on oil already.  It's a pattern.

5887 2018-07-21 17:37:33 It's hardly a moot point. If Russia is a threat to national security, it doesn't make good sense to be dependent on its oil, LPG, or uranium. Same with Iran- it doesn't make good sense to be funding our enemies. Constant devaluation of wages is not sustainable.
5888 2018-07-21 17:37:30 Does anyone know good places to get a Mercedes oil change?

5891 2018-07-21 17:37:20 Wizard oil? Okay, you're just making these up, now.
5892 2018-07-21 17:37:13 To create the materials used in virtually everything else, the crude oil must be run through a refinery...
Take it from a guy in petrochem. I mean if ya wanna waste 70 percent of the crude extracted, I'm sure we could... But it still has to be extracted to make plastic, meds, etc

Ají de Huacatay

1 rocoto pepper
1 hot chile pepper (Peruvian aji amarillo is commonly used)
1 cup of huacatay leaves
light olive oil or another relatively neutral oil (corn, sunflower...)

5917 2018-07-21 17:34:15 Forgot I needed to get my oil changed before my trip so I ran out the door at 10 this morning. Turns out I also need a new tire and it’s going to be over $100. Finally go to pay for it an almost 2 hours later and I don’t have my debit card. 
5918 2018-07-21 17:33:59 Why are the oil companies f****** the American people raising our prices , why are they f****** America, and the American people, quit buying oil any kind of fuel, for one weekend and see what they think about that
5919 2018-07-21 17:33:55 Trump should have thought about that before sanctioning China.  Most children could make that connection, but apparently not the man-child in the Oval Office.  Why hasn’t Trump added more sanctions on Putin for supplying oil to North Korea contrary to UN sanctions?
5920 2018-07-21 17:33:30 Kalo MW ya kek air. Kalo CO ya oil. Seingetku, CO tuh bisa lebih ngangkat make up sama nantinya ngga kering gitu. Kalo MW ada yg bikin kering.

5943 2018-07-21 17:30:26 Well... The north depends on the south for some foods too. (Depending on how you cut the map) Eg. Palm oil.
5944 2018-07-21 17:30:23 Maybe, but I've heard that food-grade peppermint oil on the tongue works for a lot of people. It's a shame they won't give you CBD

5951 2018-07-21 17:29:45 i think breaking up big banks would do a lot of good. and it is bipartisan, because without big banks, the small ones would get all the business. but the main benefit is that it would get people used to the idea of breaking up corporations, so we could more easily crush big oil.

95% of government subsidies are to industries like oil and pharmaceuticals that don’t need it

5973 2018-07-21 17:26:21 Wrestling is a very old and manly sport. It goes back as least as far as Ancient Greece. Where they rubbed themselves down with olive oil and wrestled naked.

5990 2018-07-21 17:25:02 Eucalyptus/Menthol/any breathe easy blend essential oil, bb!!! I find it most effective when used with an aromatherapy diffuser heh
5991 2018-07-21 17:24:43 Tel lene gaya 
What a translation  gone to get oil
5992 2018-07-21 17:24:40 Came to Walmart for an oil change, and I left with shit I didn’t even need 
5993 2018-07-21 17:24:35 I definitely agree I remember when plastic became the big thing we kind of thought that that was Recycling and helping but it turned out to be a mistake like you said and we need to solve that problem cuz our oceans are getting destroyed not only by plastic but my oil spills
5994 2018-07-21 17:24:34 The decomposition point of Olive Oil is 220 degrees Celsius
5995 2018-07-21 17:24:23 Rasulullah  said: Season (your food) with olive oil and anoint yourselves with it, for it comes from a blessed tree.” | Sunan Ibn Majah Vol. 4 Book 29 Hadith 3319

5996 2018-07-21 17:24:16 acne prone skin:
- half a spoon of turmeric powder
- 2-3 drops of tea tree oil
- 1 spoon of honey

leave it on for 15-20 minutes
5997 2018-07-21 17:24:15 Calm insomnia and pains, regulates the cycle
Saffron should be used sparingly and carefully: little on fatty foods to make them more digestible and with a pinch of stigmas, mixed with a carrier oil, you get an inflammation, painkiller ointment
5998 2018-07-21 17:24:04 Got tired of Vaseline, switched to baby oil, then Olive oil.

It never felt so good, got used to the right hand, then got familiar with the left, so now I use both...
5999 2018-07-21 17:24:00 What is because of oil? The legal and philosophical framework that sprang up in England and Holland in the 17th century that undergirds the entire system?

6001 2018-07-21 17:23:35 As the judge pointed out, oil started the industrial revolution, and we have all benefited from it.   All the oil companies did is respond to our demand.  This is not me, reactionary, speaking but a certified Bay Area judge.  We have met the oil companies, and it is us.

6015 2018-07-21 17:20:41 Of course I take my car in for a simple oil change and they find more stuff I have to do and pay for 
6016 2018-07-21 17:20:37 Spent the morning washing doors and windows with ammonia. Next I will dress them with protection oil. Magic is never done. It is always ongoing!

6019 2018-07-21 17:19:46 All following the script for the day of course. You're a bad sitcom at best. How much do you sucker the general public daily with your snake oil sales?
6020 2018-07-21 17:19:27 Have you considered an air fryer? We put no oil at all in ours, and they're done in about twelve minutes. And you can use ordinary frozen chips (crinkle cut work better for some reason) or home-sliced spuds.

6025 2018-07-21 17:18:55 The oil companies do not like you!
6026 2018-07-21 17:18:51 Frozen chips suck- chop spuds, nuke for 3 mins in microwave, toss in oil and whatever spice you like, stick in oven at about 200 for 25 mins. Yummy every time 
6027 2018-07-21 17:18:51 I've reached my final peak Italian stage: just bought someone olive oil as a birthday gift
6028 2018-07-21 17:18:48 I’ve got tampons covered in Olbas oil shoved in my nostrils 
6029 2018-07-21 17:18:34 Dude frat houses should start changing peoples oil, cause it’s basically what oil places are like anyways

6031 2018-07-21 17:18:12 Don't let your hair get into your face while you sleep. The oil from your hair can cause acne.

6038 2018-07-21 17:17:14 One is here laughing 
6039 2018-07-21 17:16:16 Secretary Zinke, stop putting the interests of private ranchers and oil before OUR wild mustangs and wildlife. Protect the Harvest is a sham and you are under investigation for your connections with big oil.
6040 2018-07-21 17:16:14 Kelvin pega a bola e só joga pra trás, não é jogador objetivo, tem muito que aprender e melhorar essa postura.
6041 2018-07-21 17:16:05 Shocking negligence by the oil companies to begin with.  Obviously many other complications at play but seems very fixable compared to other challenges in the region
6042 2018-07-21 17:16:04 Yussss ofc go HAM, also ignore coconut leaves and cherry typos, I mean coconut oil and 0 cherries involved lol

6046 2018-07-21 17:15:30 I mean, that’s the Land/Negarestani abstract horror vision of capital, perhaps — Reza wrote of oil as that which has been lying dormant in the earth’s crust, ready to enslave us. The theory-fictional way of conceiving capital’s atemporal grasp on civilisation.
6047 2018-07-21 17:15:30 Getting my oil changed and I'm learning so much from the fishing channel. For example: give your lure a haircut, it turns your fish on.

6058 2018-07-21 17:14:00 Need a oil change
6059 2018-07-21 17:13:56 Tar sands are a climate disaster! The oil from tar sands is twice as carbon intensive as most crude oil, doing twice as much damage to our climate #StopPipelines @Barclays

6062 2018-07-21 17:13:44 Seeing ocean oil rigs just a mile off the coast of Santa Barbara could easily be the scariest thing I've ever seen
6063 2018-07-21 17:13:41 My suggestion is we build the pipeline  economy relies on it, scrap the carbon tax because that’s bullshit and go and clean up the plastic island floating in the ocean . Then use some of the profits of oil to build a more environmentally friendly cities.
6064 2018-07-21 17:13:28 Me: There’s a weeping Mary in New Mexico. They can’t explain it. She’s crying. It’s an olive oil type substance. Weird.

6068 2018-07-21 17:12:17 Stupid Article assumed need for Carbon Tax - which is ridiculous - if Government cared about the environment they would stop buying foreign oil and shipping it across oceans
6069 2018-07-21 17:12:16 The only way it's going to be stopped is by reducing our dependence on fossil fuel oil and by coming up with alternative energy sources

6106 2018-07-21 17:07:03 Ya know when you like get a thing of fries at In n Out and theres a few at the bottom that are like all crispy and saturated with oil? Id assume like that
6107 2018-07-21 17:06:54 It's true. So all the shouting about "Faith","Patriotism" and "Homeland Security"  was actually just political voterbaiting to secure votes and control.

6134 2018-07-21 17:03:39 Inconceivable that u r still President & bring this up instead of being concerned about all the children that still haven't been or may never be reunited with their parents.  Leave the Endangered Species Act alone, don't drill in the Gulf especially after the horrible oil spill.
6135 2018-07-21 17:03:33 Damascus and Qamishli have signed many deals on oil fields, one of the latest on al-Omar field.
France (or any other nations) will must side w/ both of them.
6136 2018-07-21 17:03:24 Been said it was orchestrated smh just for some damn oil
6137 2018-07-21 17:03:17 It's a multi-functional display. Among other things, it can display the tire pressure, oil life, miles I have left and the AWD status.
6138 2018-07-21 17:03:17 I couldn’t deal with the concept of FISH (I have a very strong aversion), so have substituted flaxseed oil supplements. Noticeable improvements in creaking knees
6139 2018-07-21 17:03:07 Mayor of NYC tried to sue oil companies. This buffoon has flown over 70 times around country for nonsense. He thinks he'll be President. Ha
6140 2018-07-21 17:03:05 Just finished watching 'In the Heart of the Sea'. Whaling is a forgotten part of British history, but it was whale oil that helped fuel the start of the industrial revolution. There are whales swimming out in the ocean who still bare the scars from harpoons that failed.
6141 2018-07-21 17:03:01 I hope you’re suggesting we should boycott @mercola. He’s a pseudo intellectual snake oil salesman who uses a thin veneer of actual science to mask a dangerous self-serving empire of anti-medicine bullshit.
6142 2018-07-21 17:02:56 When will everyone wake up to the whole Eu Federalisation border control - Iraq/afghan war - Saudi (losing oil funded economy) funded African Muslim migration is not a set of coincidences it is world war being fought through millennium tactics.. And we seriously need to Brexit..

6145 2018-07-21 17:02:45 In my experience - you know when you do a good lasagne you get puddles of red oil/fat? That’s on everything. Even veg.
6146 2018-07-21 17:02:45 I am 34 weeks 3 days pregnant.  And I'm probably going to buy so be caster oil today.

6149 2018-07-21 17:02:19 Stress causes inflammation in our bodies. 

Try to include more anti-inflammatory foods in your diet like bananas, pineapples, carrots, and eating fish (or taking a good fish oil supplement) to reduce inflammation.
6150 2018-07-21 17:02:15 Tea tree oil works miracles. I have oily skin so I would google how to use it for sensitive skin but I swear it’s heaven sent

6154 2018-07-21 17:01:37 This article is garbage.
You people are ignorant.
And even if these things should be considered, you've failed to show how the oil will impact Guyana negatively. Further, you've failed to identify any possible solution to the "crisis"
6155 2018-07-21 17:01:35 Matt Kuchar is a hack.  Shame on me for betting on someone who would be better suited to selling clothing in a golf shop than playing.  The world is under par today and this hack has lost any chance for the Jug.  Clown.  Put a big smile on Matt and say, "oh shucks"  @TheOpen

6160 2018-07-21 17:01:05 If you don’t have oil skin it MIGHT work for you. It photographs well in the lighting I have but you’re just going to have to set it and then set with setting spray because if not this stuff will not set on it’s own

6168 2018-07-21 17:00:34 Chicken breast, salt, pepper,  put it in a pan with a tiny bit of oil and a little water if you don’t mind it a tiny bit dry. The water helps it from soaking the oil. Throw some broccoli in there and if you have a rice maker, some brown rice and chicken broth in there.
6169 2018-07-21 17:00:30 We have a Legislature for a reason, even if most care more for those that finance their campaigns (defense contractors or oil producers), they still should not be dismantled for the Citizen Premiere to off his enemies w/o clear state sponsored aggression from target country.

6183 2018-07-21 16:58:17 I am at the dealer getting my oil changed.  Saw the dealer who sold the car to me and talked for a bit.  Shook hands and he said “take care” and I said “good”..........like wtf!? lol
6184 2018-07-21 16:58:12 State is state, owner of even your land lawfully allotted if they find oil on your  small plot they will take it back. But then there is a deep state too.
6185 2018-07-21 16:58:07 Need my oil changed but don’t feel like sitting for hours up there 
6186 2018-07-21 16:58:00 Perhaps CBD oil would be a place to start? I don't know much about it but I've heard it's good for pain and anxiety and doesn't have hallucinogenic properties. Though I think you'd have to do your research to make sure you're actually getting what you pay for.

6190 2018-07-21 16:57:31 @lillianusher99 made her friends popcorn last night, the old fashion way... on the stove in a pan with oil. She said they were amazed and had no idea that it could be done like that. I love when young people learn valuable life skills.

6197 2018-07-21 16:56:17 I remember reading Halliburton used horizontal drilling to steal Iraqi oil from a site in Kuwait. - Fracking is money-losing, but it's funded anyway to wipe out competitors. Halli chief Cheney now in Golan w/other devils illegally drilling oil, but Golan also supplies much water.

6209 2018-07-21 16:54:53 I'll concede palm oil (although I don't know how much of its use can be traced back to vegetarians/vegans) and people being unable to omit meat for health reasons.
But soy in particular is - afaik - overwhelmingly used for meat production, with only a small % for direct human...

6219 2018-07-21 16:52:26 Stick to a skin routine. Exfoliate at least 3x a week, use a face wash that’s good for your skin type. Use a toner afterwards, and use something to moisturize. Tbh I moisturize with Aloe Vera because it doesn’t cause any grease or extra oil and absorbs fast. And obviously hydrate

6232 2018-07-21 16:50:11 All they have are “feelings”. No logical, realistic arguments. Without cliches, lies and disingenuous statements they are lost.
6233 2018-07-21 16:50:00 Iraq's oil is privatized, essentially. Exxon or BP extract $200m per day at one oil site. Oil rich Iraqis have intermittent electricity. All infrastructure, except pipelines, was destroyed at invasion. So, yes, it was also about oil.

6237 2018-07-21 16:49:41 I’m currently getting my oil changed. I wish I could see the guys when they take out my cabin air filter. I just replaced it so it’s pristine. They are going to be so sad.

6249 2018-07-21 16:48:33 Perhaps you should throw your support behind efforts to slow climate change. Because this is climate change, regardless of how much money the oil industry gives you to pretend otherwise.

6262 2018-07-21 16:46:18 It's the strangling grip that traders on supply from farm to fork. Each crop in season, prices crash on arrival and go up once farmers sell. Edible oil in early '90s is a classic case of determined govt breaking this monopoly. This model could be used even today by a willing govt

6273 2018-07-21 16:44:42 Weather like this is leading me into paying someone to do my oil change.
6274 2018-07-21 16:44:39 Nah it’s Lifestyle Food Odourless coconut oil 
6275 2018-07-21 16:44:21 Not sure abt first point. However it is safer to buy a fuel efficient one. In a turbulent world it dazt take long for oil prices to shoot up again and airlines will rush to order for it. Hence increasing chances of residual value. As for point 3, a contract is a contract.
6276 2018-07-21 16:44:07 I mix my coffee with MCT oil and protein powder in a blender. Easy 600-700 calories.

6286 2018-07-21 16:42:36 I spray or drop a wee bit of oil on them. -Plus you need to keep giving them a shuggle n shake.  x
6287 2018-07-21 16:42:36 So much oil
6288 2018-07-21 16:42:35 Not when their being bought by the Russians, NRA, oil/coal, pharmaceutical lobbyists etc. skim the scum out of congress. Rid DC of lobbyists and gifts given to government employees of any type
6289 2018-07-21 16:42:28 Is not even noon yet and I already worked out, did my eyebrows, and got an oil change. Feel so productive! 
6290 2018-07-21 16:42:15 Add MCT oil.
6291 2018-07-21 16:41:59 Introducing snake oil! The oil sold by snakes!
6292 2018-07-21 16:41:57 @Oseni_Babatunde i'd love to see the Oil and Gas coys as well as the DPR, NNPC and NAPIMS do the same. Oma badt gan
6293 2018-07-21 16:41:47 1. COCONUT OIL: take some coconut oil and melt it make sure you massage it into the roots and down to the ends leave in for a couple hours or all day then rise out and shampoo and condition as normal, this also helps your hair look shiney and stay healthy.
6294 2018-07-21 16:41:46 You anoint my head with oil. Tomorrow morning at 9 & 11 st Refuge Church #refugechurch209

6302 2018-07-21 16:40:42 The guy doing my oil change is surprised of be coming to do my oil change and I wash my own car. I have to...no one else does it.  Who else is going to do it?

6304 2018-07-21 16:40:24 So the oil change guy just asked if my car was a Hyundai so we're off to a rolicking start
6305 2018-07-21 16:40:17 Health Tips: find out the oxidation index of the oil you cook with, and choose the lowest number combined with the highest smoke point.
6306 2018-07-21 16:40:10 So why are we bothered with climate change, it's not going to effect us for more than 50 years, so why bother. Same with oil. It's just our grandkids. We'll be forever known as the generation that fucked it up!
6307 2018-07-21 16:40:10 That is so awesome! My mom got into them a few yrs ago & now I use the skin care, tooth paste, shampoo/conditioner, I even have the hand soap & the cleaning products for my house we are a big oil family lol they are so good for you my mom cooks w them all the dang time too

... CBD oil?
... Essential oils?
... Incense?
6311 2018-07-21 16:40:05 Oh... Body oil...
6312 2018-07-21 16:40:03 They’d say we were living on an oil reserve and invade that shit
6313 2018-07-21 16:39:45 Sadly, even without a colon you still poop all the time

6315 2018-07-21 16:39:12 I caved in at one of those booths at the mall and purchased  a $60 bottle of custom scented oil
6316 2018-07-21 16:39:09 And right across from that filling station are the CPR tracks, where many rail cars , loaded with oil stand waiting to continue their journey to the coast. Why not protest right across from where you live?
6317 2018-07-21 16:39:04 @Brands_Hatch nice day watching the bikes, shadowed only by some dodgy catering of “light fluffy fries” that weren’t light, fluffy or fries. A “cold, over cooked in old oil, greasy not fries” description would have been more honest!
6318 2018-07-21 16:39:03 Yasss..kasi ang nuts may parang oil ata yan na nagcacause ng pimples..haha
6319 2018-07-21 16:39:03 i kinda always viewed ETH as a crypto commodity. Hell it's only use case is as 'gas', so i always looked at it as like, crude oil.
6320 2018-07-21 16:39:01 No border wall, yet. Illegal border crossings at an all-time (200% more in May), no meaningful immigration legislation passed, trade deficit with China is still very high, oil prices too high, some companies moving back overseas.
6321 2018-07-21 16:38:51 And if you’re just after an American passport.. guess what I’ll b able to gain American citizenship through working with this oil company due to the fact that I’ll b considered a “vital service” and gain my naturalization.  America needs gas 
6322 2018-07-21 16:38:48 Here they favour Give me oil in my lamp, Lord of the dance, and One more step along the world I go. Amazing Grace would be most welcome!
6323 2018-07-21 16:38:37 Why should taxpayers subsidize carbon output?  Why should we subsidize oil and gas?  I am so sick of welfare to industries that don’t need it.

6327 2018-07-21 16:37:42 ang oil ng face ko
6328 2018-07-21 16:37:02 Are you completely deluded or just pretending that you don't know that the dodgy dossier was produced, not because of 911, not because saddam was a dictator, but because of oil.  Just like Libya, Syria, Iran etc
6329 2018-07-21 16:37:00 People went into that in the replies but tldr, soy and palm oil are huge pollutants, much food production is human exploitation, and many people simply cannot omit meat from their diet without getting very sick or dying.
6330 2018-07-21 16:36:53 Thank goodness for Photoshop's "oil paint" filter. Really helping me out because I accidentally used way too textured a brush for part of a piece. Duplicate layer, run the filter, set to 50% opacity and it's back to the semi-smooth painterly texture I intended to use.
6331 2018-07-21 16:36:50 Whoo Hoo! This needs retweeting a billion times. 

Your disdain for climate change denying greed pigs who are playing the oil cabal's FU game of making others pay for their economic control, is justified.
6332 2018-07-21 16:36:45 All natural products
- Caster oil, olive oil or petroleum jelly (apply on lash line before end)
- olive oil - castor oil mixture
- Green tea leaves. (Add green tea leaves in warm water then apply to lashes )
- lemon peels soaked in caster or caster oil for a few days
- argon oil
6333 2018-07-21 16:36:37 I love doing natural services. Hot oil treatments, henna color or protein treatments, mixing up conditioners on the spot b/c their hair needs something extra
6334 2018-07-21 16:36:23 I’m scared security won’t let me through with my exorbitant amount of coconut oil
6335 2018-07-21 16:36:22 Just got a massage , I really don’t like getting massages with clothes on because it’s painful.. I like the feeling of lotion or oil on my skin with a massage.

6338 2018-07-21 16:35:30 If seb had broken rules by pushing the car (after team told to stop) even worse knowing there was oil leaking from said car onto the track Hamilton would be screaming for him to be banned.
6339 2018-07-21 16:35:30 Me getting an oil change:
“No thanks”
“No im good”
“I’ll keep that in mind thanks”
“No thank you”
“I drive a Kia I don’t need $100 oil thank you”

Have a great day!

6342 2018-07-21 16:35:10 Can't understand enthusiasm for recyclable plastic. What about GLASS? Rejuvenate our greatly reduced glass industry, open new factories, provide jobs. Levy deposit on bottles. Soft drinks, ketchup, mayonnaise, oil, etc., in glass. No environmental damage, completely recyclable.
6343 2018-07-21 16:35:09 Baru juga beli bio oil sama pelembab. INI TONER ABIS:( yaampun ribet bgt jadi cewek
6344 2018-07-21 16:35:02 There’s an essential oil called deep blue that I recommend, I’ve used it for back pain and my knees. Just put some of the oil on the effected area and rub it in. But otherwise depending on where specifically the back pain is there might be another oil
6345 2018-07-21 16:34:58 Pahahaha!!
Did you have to use oil burners when they went on into the eve?! xxx
6346 2018-07-21 16:34:48 Jamaican castor oil and sheer butter also helps
6347 2018-07-21 16:34:40 Lmfaoooooooooo my cousin hit my grandma wax pen thinking it was just CBD oil in it and he like damn why I feel blowed? CAUSE YOU AREEEE 
6348 2018-07-21 16:34:29 The oil goes through the straight of Hormuz, not through Iran, and almost every Arab country exports their oil through this straight. The sanctions are against their nuclear weapons programme and involvement in terrorism. They also support Iranian peoples wish for regime change
6349 2018-07-21 16:34:15 Giving my client a lovely hot oil treatment with avocado and castor oil. Added some rosemary and eucalyptus essential oils to show some love to her curls and show off
6350 2018-07-21 16:34:03 50 000 YOUNG MEN NO DOUBT! THIS PM IS GETTING OIL MONEY FROM SOMEONE AND WE NEED TO FIND OUT EXACTLY AND EXPOSE THIS! THERE IS A REASON FOR ALL THIS MISMANAGEMENT.
6351 2018-07-21 16:33:59 And it beats the stupid BetterOffNow bs the GOP rolled out. Who is better off now? The billionaires, the corporate goons, their cronies raping the environment for coal and oil. Them, mostly. Emptying the treasury. MS-13 hahaha! Faux News much?
6352 2018-07-21 16:33:39 I think Musk is an exception. He's still human with flaws, but his goal genuinely is to create and inspire, not collect wealth and destroy (other than old oil/auto companies). Negative press about him is largely due to the billion dollar bets against Tesla.
6353 2018-07-21 16:33:32 Lmaoooo speaking of i need a car wash n oil change 
6354 2018-07-21 16:33:29 Who is buying Russian oil? Whose weapons is Russia sold to? It is a good idea to join forces with Russia to better attack our business partners.
6355 2018-07-21 16:33:20 Omg thank you so much! It’s the best compliment because I have very sensitive skin and have been working to keep it super healthy lately! I stopped using lotions and body wash with scents and stuff in it and using vitamin e oil 
6356 2018-07-21 16:32:23 Same.  Been Keto for 18 months and have never tasted MCT oil. My ketones are made in my body lab

6361 2018-07-21 16:31:54 Carried on after his team told him to stop, pushed the car up the track which he knew was against the rules and to make that worse he admitted seeing oil leaking from the car as he was pushing it up the track, had it been seb Ham would be calling for a ban.
6362 2018-07-21 16:31:47 PTI - but @tim_beloat I got an email from a guy named Vlad-Mikhaiil Morooshnikov.   He’s got some Nigerian oil investment deals & said if you go to PSP today and use ze code “EH3Rules” you’ll get a BOGO on the Mex ‘za
6363 2018-07-21 16:31:45 That was the plan all along. The oil there will make Putin a trillionaire.
6364 2018-07-21 16:31:30 Thought I would do some battered courgette with our fish pie......

Didn't concentrate and ended up getting splashed with a bit of oil on my bare foot. Ouch! 
6365 2018-07-21 16:31:19 Nope.  But I have done the cover floor with lots and lots of newspapers then pour oil over the innards!

6370 2018-07-21 16:30:42 Are you trying to say that Scotland got absolutely no investment from the UK oil wealth? We live in the UK and that means sharing resources among 4 countries. Why is it Scots think they are hard done by? Do you have a collective inferiority complex? Your moaning is hard to take.

6374 2018-07-21 16:30:28 It’s for its colouring it has some fish oil in it
6375 2018-07-21 16:30:27 “Adds the olive oil drip by drip…”
6376 2018-07-21 16:30:25 The straight of Hormuz impacts 20% of all oil production so if they close it then Iran would most likely fall in quick succession. The sanctions are against their nuclear weapons program and in support of the Iranian people who want regime change in Iran
6377 2018-07-21 16:30:19 Turkana residents now back to walking over 20km to get water since Tullow closed down operations following a standoff on oil revenues.

When politicians loot resources and sustain underdevelopment, the community remains ignorant and that is why oil rarely benefits Africa.
6378 2018-07-21 16:30:17 Dear @PresidentKE you need to have massive civil education done at the oil exploration centre. The people there don't understand. Have them educated ASAP.
6379 2018-07-21 16:30:11 Need to mix my beard oil, been using baby oil for the past few days
6380 2018-07-21 16:29:54 But are you sure you told me just coconut oil will cure my life
6381 2018-07-21 16:29:32 so today at work i got sprayed in the head/face with motor oil and had to wash my hair in a sink... how's everyone else's day going:)
6382 2018-07-21 16:29:19 Good.
The US bully countries and then expect to ship non Iranian oil through Iran, while they impose harsh sanctions on a country who's done nothing??
#Trump should of thought about that before he started willy waving. Prick.
6383 2018-07-21 16:29:09 It's quite a coincidence that Trump's campaign for countries to cut their purchases of oil from Iran means Russia and Saudi Arabia have been able to add roughly 500,000 barrels per day to the market in recent weeks.  #ImpeachTrump
6384 2018-07-21 16:29:00 oo ok the coconut oil came in clutch tho
6385 2018-07-21 16:28:54 I'm so confused on what brand to buy and now this article suggest many products are mislabeled. Do you use CBD oil and can you recommend a product?
6386 2018-07-21 16:28:42 Tullow oil management will do the wish of the locals whether they lile or not of which if they can't then somebody to remind them of the biafra war or delta war against the Nigerian government due to oil!
6387 2018-07-21 16:28:40 What brexiters don't realise, amongst other things, is that the UK is over reliant on foreign owned manufacturers based here, the city and formerly Oil. The first two are going to be badly mauled by Brexit.

6405 2018-07-21 16:26:07 Agree FR a good business, no unshakeable moat exists in civil aviation though IMHO.   Constant CapEx, Oil price fluctuation and new entrants attack all airlines.........
6406 2018-07-21 16:26:04 So not only is using oil a possible tool, it's one Putin has employed on the battlefield to annex crimea

6416 2018-07-21 16:25:03 Trump lied so much to American people. Some we're unfortunately not smart and believed this treasonous bastard. He's selling our Country out to Putin under our eyes and in return he's gonna get UKRAINE oil $$.  Putting PUTIN higher w/ WORLD order. Trump's scared shitless.#Impeach

6418 2018-07-21 16:24:37 Really he has the power of the entire u.s. government, some of the worlds most respected economic advisers. You think he just made up that the previous German chancellor has a 51% stake in a Russian state owned oil company
6419 2018-07-21 16:24:26 it'll be horrible because I'll smell like oil after working but i'll get money so i guess i have to go through it

6458 2018-07-21 16:18:40 And btw, not just Muslims are shooting people for insane reasons. That’s interesting, cause we’re plagued by Islamic fundamentalism but we fail to acknowledge that Boko Haram e.g. is spreading through nations where people are living 9/11 every day, where our oil companies make $.

6553 2018-07-21 16:06:21 I like both. Not much into hard liquor, but I do enjoy beer or wine in moderation. And I love using CBD oil with melatonin for sleep and anxiety.
6554 2018-07-21 16:06:17 Just lathered my body and hair in coconut oil and had the nicest bubble bath & now settling down for the evening to watch a Netflix series on the world toughest and most dangerous prisons. What a contrast 
6555 2018-07-21 16:06:09 i love those days where i have to smother my face in tea tree oil and apple cider vinegar and not leave my house!
6556 2018-07-21 16:05:55 You don't need any more unsolicited advice from a stranger on the internet but I live in the south and bugs (especially mosquitos) are a war. I've found that tea tree gel (not oil) immediately relieves itching and reduces the redness and bump by like 80% in a couple hours. 
6557 2018-07-21 16:05:54 A pet peeve of mine is when somebody puts their finger into my Vaseline, coconut oil, or body butters. Use your knuckle please. It makes me feel better.
6558 2018-07-21 16:05:44 I can’t eat kfc anymore dem need to change dem oil 
6559 2018-07-21 16:05:36 Mmmm ok. But I need to go to a nice beach covered in oil before the summer comes to a close. Thanks
6560 2018-07-21 16:05:19 My sister kept a pan full of oil on the stove and forgot. It caught a big fire 
6561 2018-07-21 16:05:15 Is it bad that....I really feel a strong kinship with Big Boss? Like, political fuckery aside, I too think about smoking cigars, wearing eyepatches, creating mercenary armies with no homeland, partying with my gay ass friends on a giant oil rig, making David Bowie references, goi

6564 2018-07-21 16:05:02 Currently sweating like crazy cause I sautéed savoy cabbage in chili oil, and even the rice cuisine/coconut aminos/liquid smoke sauce can't curb the heat... Very tasty tho.

6566 2018-07-21 16:04:35 I feel like the big oil/car company want him to fail so bad so they can keep the monopoly on us. Also he’s getting $1B from Chicago to make his tunnel system
6567 2018-07-21 16:04:32 I knew Tiger Woods would play well. He tends to leak oil in the last few holes though.
6568 2018-07-21 16:04:26 Steak tartare is made with olive oil.
6569 2018-07-21 16:04:07 MAY GOD HELP ALL AMERICANS ---IF GOP. crook Kevin McCarthy becomes Speaker of House.
Then every OIL well & every SCAR on this earth of the USA will be COAL mined, DEFACED, and more OIL PIPELINES will dominate the U.S. private properties.

6574 2018-07-21 16:03:27 Do a makeup wipe, oil cleanser and foam cleanser. I swear my triple cleanings. If you don’t use th makeup wipe you’re emulsifying the makeup, grime and sweat. Foam leaves it smooth post oil cleanser
6575 2018-07-21 16:03:25 Best feeling ever tau lepas mandi, siap oiling, put on skin serum, on diffuser dengan favourite oil fuhhhh nyaman
6576 2018-07-21 16:03:25 This beard oil that smells like Christmas is basically my favorite thing not made of bacon or tits.
6577 2018-07-21 16:03:23 We put veg oil in their food now and one is on anti/inflammatory meds. Made a huge difference. Lovely old rob.
6578 2018-07-21 16:03:11 2 things; Norway had the good sense to create a Sovereign Wealth Fund from its oil revenues & its 5.5m people enjoy a very high standard of living/social benefits.  As opposed to selling it off to highest bidder. 
Many Norwegians feel now that it would be better to be IN the EU!
6579 2018-07-21 16:03:07 back to work oil changed on car, never was in question. label already gave me a $50,000 advance

6592 2018-07-21 16:00:52 Oh dip, it's been a while since I've really used truffle oil! I used to put it in my mac and cheese ALL THE TIME, and it can be good on strong flavored ramen as well, like tonkatsu, or beef based broths. Also good on white pizza, and other non-tomato based pasta dishes!

6604 2018-07-21 15:59:59 Russia ahead of the curve. Putin trying to establish a foundation to make a Russian-U.S. alliance in Syria more palpable to people by showing its outreach to humanitarian efforts, Trump will try to (at Putin's direction & for Genie Energy interests) get Golan Heights oil in deal.

6611 2018-07-21 15:59:26 Free pass? Absolutely not! #Turkey have enabled western backed 'rebels' to cross it's border into #Syria, & arms, chemical weapons etc. They've stolen oil, & industrial machinery from #Aleppo. They've allowed the training of jihadists inside it's borders b4 crossing to Syria.

2) which one goes first: hair oil or serum?

thank you

6619 2018-07-21 15:58:06 I think Putin is offering Trump a cut in their oil revenues if sanctions are lifted. The big deal Tillerson made for Exon got squashed due to Sanctions
6620 2018-07-21 15:58:03 Gotta keep him clean and he need a oil change
6621 2018-07-21 15:57:54 What does my cute, funny, sometimes semi-put together ass have to do to find an oil tycoon?
6622 2018-07-21 15:57:44 A sharp increase in oil prices – Pakistan imports about 80 percent of oil needs – has contributed to a current account deficit that widened 43 percent to $18 billion in the fiscal year that ended June 30.

I'll share some points on how to knock the doors of Shell and Petronas. Based on my own experiences working with them. 

Not now. Tomorrow

6629 2018-07-21 15:56:40 Looks like a rat in oil
6630 2018-07-21 15:56:40 not with olive oil... you don't put any oil or butter or maybe a little sunflower oil with butter, but olive ?? I'm not Italian
6631 2018-07-21 15:56:38 just learned that when you go to get an oil change at a mechanic shop they fill all ya other fluids too. 
6632 2018-07-21 15:56:28 We know we have to diversify our energy by using more renewables along with oil and gas yet we continue to go back to the 1970s mentality. This is a global economy and Trump doesn’t understand his theory and reality are 2 different things.

If US does nothing when Persian Gulf is closed I’m quiet sure that US will not put any effort to interrupt People Republic oil transport route from Persian gulf.
And People Republic is Iran biggest customer so Iran won’t sunk their VLCC.

6639 2018-07-21 15:55:01 I have completed given up buying my daily necessaries MADE BY MULTI NATIONAL COMPANIES Instead I started using Patanjali Herbal Products like tooth paste , detergent powder, bathing soap, detergent soap, mustard oil, sunflower oil , Mug dal etc. from market and totally satisfied
6640 2018-07-21 15:54:32 The petrodollar keeps the U.S war machine and its black unaccountable budget in tact.
OPEC was promised american protection at its conception as long as it sold oil in dollars. Dollars go into the bank of America and R invested making vast profits, like all banks operate.
6641 2018-07-21 15:54:26 I disagree. In lieu of peak oil, the ability of future generations to deal with the problems associated with accidents and disposal is nigh impossible. Look at Fukishima, they're considering destroying all the world's oceans because they don't to deal with the waste water
6642 2018-07-21 15:54:17 Pasta, oil, butter, garlic, salt, pepper.
6643 2018-07-21 15:54:06 Just one example....You eat raw fucking meat with olive oil. EOD.
6644 2018-07-21 15:54:00 I go all the way out to my favorite auto shop for an oil change (they looked out when I was pushing the bucket) and them ninjas have the nerve to be closed with hours posted saying otherwise.  
6645 2018-07-21 15:53:57 So oil,fake butter,salt and garlic aren't healthy...... it dominoes, people aren't eating it cause it's even remotely not just a pile of fat. 675 calories per tub, get a straw fatties.
6646 2018-07-21 15:53:54 but they are wrong. The number employed by oil and gas is 230,000.  Suncor alone employs 13,500 and thats more than half the clean energy jobs which that clean energy report states is 23,000.
6647 2018-07-21 15:53:46 Use the Holy oil and the Tincture and you will lose interest in alcohol. 2 chronic alcoholics used just tincture on their skin & it reduced their intake by about 30%. Add Holy oil and people can quit. What else don't we know about cannabis?
6648 2018-07-21 15:53:43 With the increase in oil cars, I doubt the change in rail miles travelled is that noticeable
6649 2018-07-21 15:53:43 I also have full sized ingrown hair oil and bath salts w/ rose petals ready
6650 2018-07-21 15:53:39 Bruh this oil change cost too fucking much 
6651 2018-07-21 15:53:31 lol i know what CBD is for. I'm looking for a good vaporizer for my oil :)
6652 2018-07-21 15:53:28 1. The tearing apart of the EU, NATO and western democracy.
2. The restoration of the Soviet Union by cyber & military aggression.
3. Disruption of our political system by sowing discord.
4. Ensuring a "pro-oil" U.S. leader since oil and gas are Russia's primary export.
6653 2018-07-21 15:53:21 your booty is perfection! mmm especially with oil on it or just wet at all!

6655 2018-07-21 15:52:33 "top scientists" is an opinion, not a fact. Take Michael Mann for example, calls his "hockey-stick" graph "iconic" at least 5 times in 15 minutes when it is actually a proven fraud. Snake oil salesmen always claim they are geniuses.

6661 2018-07-21 15:52:17 I know when that happened to me an oil change place in town fixed it for me for free, money wise you might not get the same luck but find one and they should be able to fix it.

6670 2018-07-21 15:50:45 A few thousand diaspora being used by west as pawns to guarantee control of middle east  for oil does not constitute grass roots revolution. History- West will discard you like napkins later. Build grassroots support in Iran, open backdoor channels with regime- think long term.

6674 2018-07-21 15:50:30 Drip a couple drops of garlic oil in your ear before going to a doctor! A year ago this month both my ears were infected,  and they were draining down my throat and my throat swelled shut. 3 weeks of antibiotics nothing by now I'm down 30lbs. 2 days of garlic oil and I was fine.
6675 2018-07-21 15:50:19 Says the globalist who loves Saudi oil money 
6676 2018-07-20 23:59:59 Sounds like when my wife attempts to womansplain in a belittling manner that our car isn’t running well because it has no oil yet she can’t locate the oil dipstick. Yes, she thinks the oil life monitor shows oil level. I get belittling womansplained daily. It’s cute!
6677 2018-07-20 23:59:49 Boiling crab is disgusting. They sauce taste like oil.
6678 2018-07-20 23:59:45 You mean when he asked NATO to pay more. And stop getting oil and gas from Russia. The answer it doesn't benefit Russia at all

6681 2018-07-20 23:59:23 Last point b4 I call it a night.
Norway is sitting on a $Trillion fund.
A fraction of that cash could achieve great things if others get involved.
Norway already has a big stake in renewable stuff here in Scotland. We could tie up NS oil over the whole north of Europe between us.
6682 2018-07-20 23:59:19 In the 1970's, Henry Kissinger devised a strategy of factionalisation to keep the Arab world from posing a threat to US corporate & geopolitical interests (oil, anti-communism).

It never stopped. For fifty years, the US has fucked that region over, arming & enabling extremists.
6683 2018-07-20 23:59:05 It depends. Honestly been doing alot of arugula salads with olive oil, balsamic, dried oregano and basil, pepper and cherry tomatoes.
6684 2018-07-20 23:58:53 My mama think coconut oil the cure for ever damn thing

Norway is sitting on a $Trillion fund.
A fraction of that cash could achieve great things if others get involved.
Norway already has a big stake in renewable stuff here in Scotland. We could tie up NS oil over the whole north of Europe between us.
6702 2018-07-20 23:59:19 In the 1970's, Henry Kissinger devised a strategy of factionalisation to keep the Arab world from posing a threat to US corporate & geopolitical interests (oil, anti-communism).

It never stopped. For fifty years, the US has fucked that region over, arming & enabling extremists.

6721 2018-07-20 23:55:49 If oil prices went through the roof and electricity costs were somehow unaffected, I could see an advantage to EVs... But as it is, I see no reason for the non-fan average person to buy an EV. Too expensive and impractical.

6734 2018-07-20 23:52:34 Fuck black olives. A whole goddamn salad ruined by putting those little sliced up turds in there and changing the flavor of EVERYTHING! They have zero place in food. Olives are for oil and Martini's I guess, if you're into that, but that's about all.

6749 2018-07-20 23:50:38 I Need highlighters, more pens, a backpack, a lunchbag, crayons, coloring book, and bumblebee tuna. I also need my hair oil spray, shampoo and conditioner, and leave in conditioner. And then I'll be good 
6750 2018-07-20 23:50:35 Both parties are shit and bend over for oil and gas. Neither has a problem with using tax dollars to support industry
6751 2018-07-20 23:50:25 It wasn’t in Social Studies. Definitely in science though. I know we had stuff from oil companies as like...activity books and stuff.

6766 2018-07-20 23:48:16 l hear you... I just adopted a cat and my old allergies are flaring up as well! Try eucalyptus essential oil. Put a few drops on a tissue and inhale... Or sniff it right out of the bottle. It's good for clearing up the sinuses and it has helped me tremendously...

6768 2018-07-20 23:47:48 Always tweezers!  Especially my "car tweezers". I swear when I take my car in for an oil change they take them!  I'm not alone on the car tweezers..right?
6769 2018-07-20 23:47:45 His claim is message is valid. His problem is with the messenger and she's just not skilled enough yet at serving up the BS.
6770 2018-07-20 23:47:42 Honestly, if it's anything like an oil economy (everything focuses on one or two "endowed" exports, there's no real middle class, technology and business development falter), then maybe we could have been more prosperous.

6773 2018-07-20 23:47:15 Love this judge. Any town or state that has the stupidity to sue an energy supplier should have that source of energy shut off. This doesn’t mean if there is an oil spill the company must pat to clean it up.

6777 2018-07-20 23:46:44 Just curious when this was? Because my school curriculum in the late 80s mirrors a lot of what the suggested curriculum has in terms of time frame and context.

I wasn't taught to be a proud Albertan or anything about oil in K-4. Lots of Cree and Blackfoot stuff though!

6781 2018-07-20 23:46:08 I had a car that did that and it ended up going into the oil which gave me an oil leak after awhile and then the whole engine had to be replaced. Good luck  I hope you find the source quick!

6795 2018-07-20 23:45:13 This discount has been in place for a couple of years and won’t close until the regulatory and tax environment improves and pipeline investment begins again. We have adopted policies that shut in our oil. This was one of the points of my blog post.

6804 2018-07-20 23:43:26 It's also worth mentioning, we will analyse our options for EU membership.
We won't just jump into full membership - we will negotiate an arrangement that suits our needs - probably along the lines of Norway, retaining control of our fishing, oil, etc, with FM, SM, ECJ, CU, etc.
6805 2018-07-20 23:43:19 This sounds incredibly like an oil state.

6807 2018-07-20 23:43:00 It’s all about the combinations that work best for you. There should be a type of oil, moisturizer, leave-in conditioner, natural shampoo, and a cowash. Most of the time there’s products that are oil+moisturizer.

6828 2018-07-20 23:39:56 I agree it was the worst chapter. But at least he's fighting the Koch brothers and big oil.
6829 2018-07-20 23:39:48 If it looks like motor oil...I ain’t drinking it.

6831 2018-07-20 23:39:39 I am still really sick from CBD oil. I have horrible chest tightness, headache, chills, nausea, vomiting, burning itchy throat and eyes. I guess this why I can’t have nice things @taylorswift13 @taylornation13. #reptourMetlife #reptourEastRutherford isn’t meant to be after all.
6832 2018-07-20 23:39:28 These words could have been written for me right now...
'I need a station
I need a break
I need an oil change
I need something to help me along on my way
Need something to keep me awake'

6834 2018-07-20 23:39:05 Do you think the economics could look something an an oil endowment? A cotton "endowment"?
6835 2018-07-20 23:38:04 How much did you make on that Russian oil Company Putin gave you a percentage of again?

6838 2018-07-20 23:37:23 Looking for a job in the oil and gas field, any suggestions
6839 2018-07-20 23:37:21 Truth indeed rather alleviates than hurts, and will always bear up against falsehood, as oil does above water. -Miguel de Cervantes #quote #motivation
6840 2018-07-20 23:37:12 Hard problem, but it gets simpler if we 1) stop subsidizing practices that hurt the planet -- stop subsidizing oil, gas, and carbon in general; 2) charge companies for externalized costs such as pollution; 3) realize the market does not need to rule over human values
6841 2018-07-20 23:37:09 No Black Man Bush Sr. Was cocaine King. He owned Zapta Oil and he was from 1976 head of CIA, they run shit. The President usually don’t know shit other than what they tell him.
6842 2018-07-20 23:37:09 Baldrick if you take 100pc of oil tax revenues and apply 100pc of those oil tax revenues you get a gigantic £13bn a year deficit 

Next stupid assumption ...?

6848 2018-07-20 23:36:32 When you're so tired that nothing matters anymore
6849 2018-07-20 23:36:14 そういう感じ。
エロとして描いたというより、いつもの何気ない日常の一部として描いた感じ。あの時代ならこんな感じかな？っていう。たまたま0721の日だったからそうなっただけである。

6850 2018-07-20 23:35:53 Agreed..again, having timely access to a patient medical record by a TREATING CLINICIAN is a no-brainer and will improve care and decrease risk. Let’s stick with that..insurance companies, politicians and snake oil sellers...STAY AWAY..
6851 2018-07-20 23:35:25 If you've never lathered yourself in coconut oil on your weekly "spa day" you're not living.
6852 2018-07-20 23:35:12 Cleaned my car inside and out! Got a  oil change, and popped open black ice air freshener. My car smells like a bomb ass man with a thick beard 
6853 2018-07-20 23:34:43 If you have any vegan sour cream thatd help but water and some oil if not.

6859 2018-07-20 23:33:57 Haven't tried them yet. Forgot to when they were free in the app. They're made with olive oil, correct?
6860 2018-07-20 23:33:49 This is true. What is not so often mentioned is that that same oil wealth has also been stolen from the UK, if you happen to believe, as unionists do, that it is UK oil. I rather think that ought to be emphasised occasionally
6861 2018-07-20 23:33:41 But so the Americans could gain access to his oil. Anyone who thinks that is defendable behaviour, is wrong.
Also there is no equivalence with war crimes, pol pot can't be described as less evil for killing less than Hitler. A war crime, is a war crime
6862 2018-07-20 23:33:31 ぽはやー
6863 2018-07-20 23:33:30 Pure coconut oil and argan oil in your hair overnight once a week! Shampoo to get it out, leave conditioner in for 15 mins.
6864 2018-07-20 23:33:12 @DividendEarner They make money even when the oil was around $25. Greasy oil companies :)

6870 2018-07-20 23:32:30 The Russian government vetoed the choice of @MittRomney for Sec. of State. They picked Rex Tillerson, and oil prices went up 40% in one year. Russia’s economy is oil driven. We are paying a 40% #TrumpPutin tax, every time we get gas. @realDonaldTrump #lockhimup
6871 2018-07-20 23:32:18 Bro, twitter, yall ever feel just so outta place its not even funny? I know like 7 animes. Im out here blending like oil and water.
6872 2018-07-20 23:32:16 Turmeric. Assloads of turmeric. Make sure it is organic. And combined with the curcumin in black pepper it can boost and fight cancer cells. Also idk what your beliefs are, or if you live in a legal state cannabis oil can do wonders. God bless ya man. Hope y'all are better soon.
6873 2018-07-20 23:31:37 I had an olive oil one you put on your tongue & , couldnt tell effect wise. But okay let me know!

6878 2018-07-20 23:30:53 They are all heavily invested in RUSSIAN OIL.
6879 2018-07-20 23:30:40 I am sure you mean to say your State of Origin government is struggling to pay salary. Where were you when @GEJonathan was borrowing to pay salary with the huge revenue his administration got from oil? I know @MBuhari is your major problem but you will be OK after 2023.
6880 2018-07-20 23:30:39 They used to believe that oil was a fossil fuel, so that term still gets thrown around.
6881 2018-07-20 23:29:13 6) Buy only the leanest cuts of meat possible and then add fat back with cooking oil because the "science isn't settled" on animal fat. 

7) Refuse to use olive oil because you are worried about "oil fraud"

8) Carry a mini blender on trips to make your bulletproof coffee
6882 2018-07-20 23:29:11 しお。
ん？それはどういう意味かな？
6883 2018-07-20 23:29:11 I love the argument that “City wouldn’t be where they are if it weren’t for oil” as if I’m supposed to feel bad that we have an owner who bought us that values winning trophies over net spend and is investing massive sums of £ into the game making the PL more exciting as a whole.
6884 2018-07-20 23:29:07 haha. you have the best GIFs, Nicky!!!! That sounds great to me. 

Yesterday, i did a hot oil whole body massage. it felt so good!!!! i still cannot believe how cheap it's. We are going to do massages everyday before we leave Thailand. At least, that's the plan. :)
6885 2018-07-20 23:29:03 Putin is bating him with money. Regardless of the narrative that trump is wealthy he’s not half as wealthy as people believe. He’s had major $ probs and he’ll do anything for $. A la Russian oil deal anyone?
6886 2018-07-20 23:28:54 Trump-pardoned arsonists were flown home by Forrest Lucas, who owns Lucas Stadium where Pence did his staged walkout against kneeling, on US taxpayer$. After $50B from Russia, Lucas Oil (Iraq) is all better now. #PenceKnew all the Russian collusion by DT, Manafort, Flynn, Prince.

6891 2018-07-20 23:28:13 All we know is that any US tech anti-trust policy will look different than what was handed down to Standard Oil or AT&T, since the new tech giants don’t have a traditional monopoly that imposes high costs to consumers.
6892 2018-07-20 23:28:06 Convert mining/ind. equip to gas.  #LNG is unlikely to  wean developing nations from oil (why would they trade dependency on oil for dependency on gas) Why not use our gas here to power our own industry? Being in non-emitting part of planet is like being in nonpeeing part of pool
6893 2018-07-20 23:28:05 I’ve been using Jamaican black castor oil and it’s working but I’m going to take a break on the wax for now
6894 2018-07-20 23:28:05 Indy Scotland will keep all tax revenues from oil and gas, services, fishing quotas, exports, will have laws to grow economy rather than a tax raise....all things we do t currently have control over...the deficit is UK made and does not show economic outcome of indy

6898 2018-07-20 23:27:14 Trump is killing the Russian economy. All they have to sell is oil and vodka. No thanks to the idiot Obama's climate hysteria. Now trump is threatening Putin's energy customers by teaching Europe how to frack for themselves.  Undermining Putin.

6915 2018-07-20 23:25:02 No the rise comes from how much profit now turn over without "oil money" look at our income and compare it to Liverpool's. Our owners have got it spot on, on and of the pitch. of course we spent a lot of money initially because we were playing catch up. But the fact is 1/2
6916 2018-07-20 23:24:47 Use with growth hair oil on it
6917 2018-07-20 23:24:45 i know it is an odd question for me to ask, but what is the best beard oil out there that also nourishes the skin really well to keep things from being itchy?
6918 2018-07-20 23:24:42 @TysonBrand I have a question regarding ingredients. My wife is severely allergic to canola oil. What type of vegetable is used to set the breading of your nuggets, strips,and patties?

6933 2018-07-20 23:22:05 Reason why I don't trade oil. I leave that up to people like you 
6934 2018-07-20 23:21:57 Majority of that rise comes from the chunks of oil money investments. Which brings back to my original point. You spend lots without selling. Without money injection your club aren’t sustainable enough to afford big players.

6963 2018-07-20 23:18:37 It's a little bit of an inside joke. I was getting my hair cut a few weeks back, and my stylist (who of course knows what I do for a living) said, "hey, did you hear Conoco found a s***-ton of oil?"

6970 2018-07-20 23:17:15 What are we saying @RAN what can we do? @Nestle @NestleUSA Nestle why don’t you just stop using palm oil! What cost profit! Your children yes you CEO of @Nestle might never see a Orangutan because you chose profit! It’s a corporation your a human! #palmoil -pp 
6971 2018-07-20 23:17:08 And yet Ms. McKenna speaks in favour of the pipeline and exports of the products from the oil sands.
6972 2018-07-20 23:17:02 Clinton wanted to go to  war with Syria! Obama had CIA training camps for Al Quaeda/Al Nusra in Jordan to wage war on Syria for what? For oil! So do you think Snowden and Manning are not heros?
6973 2018-07-20 23:16:38 Idk  I’ma make this strand balm w/ Shea butter & rosemary oil (supposed to promote hair growth) and Braids?????
6974 2018-07-20 23:16:29 Correct. One of the factors keeping oil prices low is the transition to renewable energy. Global investments over $1 trillion are replacing fossil fuel generation with solar & wind generation. It will accelerate, & by 2050 50% of electricity generation will come from renewables.

6982 2018-07-20 23:16:05 2) due to supply crisis (,Iran etc) and higher demand in OIL the oil price spiked up and hence CAD increases which again indirects puts pressure on rupee.2/2
6983 2018-07-20 23:16:04 No heat. Leave in conditioner 3 times a week (wrap it overnight) BIOSILK oil when it’s still damp. Only brush damp hair with a wide tooth comb. Hair vitamins. Give it 6 months and you’ll be a luscious glowing goddess

Mason jar, mineral oil and a small glass jar inverted inside. The slight horizontal shadow on the right side of the mason jar (about half way up) is the bottom of the small jar.

6986 2018-07-20 23:15:53 Salary again.VS Under Adeosun even when oil price fell to $27 she still paid salaries. VERDICT: Adeosun did better for managing the economy during recession, building our foreign reserves back and curtailing corruption in agencies through implementation of TSA.

6989 2018-07-20 23:15:38 Hope it is the case and @bankofcanada keep raising. However underlying thing is different.  Oil up more in last yr and they are unable to match #FED raising frequency. It's all boiling down to #housing

6994 2018-07-20 23:15:02 Why would anybody buy a truck from Perkins motors when they have the worst service in Colorado Springs. I had my ram truck in for service today for an oil change and a recall. Unbelievably poor service and extremely poor communication. #perkinsmotors #worstserviceever #neveragain

6997 2018-07-20 23:14:41 used in the cooking process somewhere along the line. either fried rice or put in the water boiling. or on top after it’s cooked. (not always just oil...some kind of fat ).

I'm utterly convinced you're going to write the sequel to Khubla Khan tonight.
7000 2018-07-20 23:14:03 Took my damn car to the neighboring town for an oil change and it's been like 3 hours so yeah, sup guys I'm a fuckin nomadic hobo now fuck.

7004 2018-07-20 23:13:40 Going to a mechanic in the worst. You go in for a simple oil change, they look at your engine talking bout “sir your engine is on fire and it’s gonna explode you’re lucky you made it in, i can fix it for $800 right now”
7005 2018-07-20 23:13:22 This needs to be an oil painting.
7006 2018-07-20 23:13:22 To get stuck in a rule wherein one time I just beat cuphead on a joke which completely encapsulates an oil change for not
7007 2018-07-20 23:13:15 Nothing better than going to get your oil changed and two days later you find out they didn’t put any oil back in! (I won’t name names but it was valvoline)
7008 2018-07-20 23:12:50 Speaking to many European refiners, they all say they are maxed out on light crude oil. Anymore in the blend and they have to cut throughput and reduce cracker and Coker utilizations. Refiners not prepared to do that. Running less throughput worse than a reduced margin.
7009 2018-07-20 23:12:40 1) Complain loudly about the evils of sugar. 
2) Refuse to eat anything at restaurant but salad with olive oil because "chefs secretly add sugar and flour to everything, even steak. 
3) Carry a gallon jug of water everywhere
3a) Carry Real Salt to add to the jug.

7014 2018-07-20 23:11:36 I swear @GardenaNissan will make you hate getting your car serviced. 8+ hours for an oil change and to get engine mounts replaced.
7015 2018-07-20 23:11:31 Fake news and fabricated fallacy, why only in oil and gas sectors? is other sectors not functional? cursed party.
7016 2018-07-20 23:11:24 anyone know where i can buy tea tree oil

うわぁ…ゴキブリと場所を分けて、でもゴキブリ並にいるって感じですか…うへぇｗ
7021 2018-07-20 23:09:21 Those burnt square things are the gnocchi? This looks like something scooped out of the bin near the prep tables at Crossroads Kitchen, and then someone threw some shaved parm and ham in and drizzled with olive oil like fucking Jamie Oliver. Stunningly awful.
7022 2018-07-20 23:09:09 Peppermint oil and binaural beats on YouTube with headphones. With painkillers. Only things that help me!
7023 2018-07-20 23:08:56 I think that's not what is being questioned, but it's how much longer can modern life live on oil and natural gas, before there isn't any left?
7024 2018-07-20 23:08:46 Hey @kimbones_GTS 1. we were the dickheads dancing and screaming along in the front at the gig tonight and it was GR8 2. You shouldn't put coconut oil on your face!! Some types of oil are ok for faces but coconut can cause breakouts!
7025 2018-07-20 23:08:42 I was meant to be going but I am now currently in a B&B in Dyce about to get a helicopter to an oil rig tomorrow morning :(
7026 2018-07-20 23:08:04 "Capitalist impulses" like nationalizing all privately held means of oil production.  Totally.  "Capitalism" now apparently means centrally planning an economy. Good times
7027 2018-07-20 23:07:45 I love my new oil diffuser 
7028 2018-07-20 23:07:41 And finally... a dragon is going to get another pimple for the third time this week. Stop smearing butter and oil on your face, it clogs your pores. #ThirdEye
7029 2018-07-20 23:07:38 Lavender oil for your pillow 
7030 2018-07-20 23:07:26 I do not remember anyone saying you were to tough on anyone since you've been president. Snake oil salesmen aren't tough
7031 2018-07-20 23:07:24 Smells like cedar, beard oil and butt sex
7032 2018-07-20 23:07:23 What I learnt today? PT1
The site is very clean, tidy and structured. We are doing all the Portland tests, then moving on to the kimmeridge. That oil has dissolved gasses like Lemonaide, or Champers. That expand and help lift it to the surface.  #UKOG
7033 2018-07-20 23:06:47 Surprised she's not investing in Arctic oil/ LNG... Maybe she is??
7034 2018-07-20 23:06:45 I applied at an oil change company to change oil not to put air in tires lol
7035 2018-07-20 23:06:31 I do not eat breakfast anymore, I make Keto coffee, basically coffee + heavy cream + coconut oil + butter + Keto-friendly sweetener all blended up, tastes like a creamy milkshake. BUT if you must have breakfast, eggs, spinach, lots of butter or bacon + bacon fat
7036 2018-07-20 23:06:15 Experts..We have had enough of experts..We need more Snake oil salesmen..
7037 2018-07-20 23:05:57 I need oil for my pen 
7038 2018-07-20 23:05:39 Dad did an oil change on the Blazemobile for next weeks run...suffice tae  say, @WiiShiite is maukit noo...
7039 2018-07-20 23:05:34 Time to get back up off my ass and continue. Here I go...I'm going...<sound of knees creaking like hinges that need oil....>.
7040 2018-07-20 23:05:05  my grandma say she want her coconut oil with yo ashy ass
7041 2018-07-20 23:04:59 Motive was oil then?  Yes?
7042 2018-07-20 23:04:40 But if it cleans oil off ducks it should work on your dishes.
7043 2018-07-20 23:04:34 Zinke has no ethics. He is repugnant and a joke. Zinke is destroying wildlife n America. One oil dike or one strip mine at a time. The rest of the time he shoots endangered species or changes the laws to allow shooting of endangered species. Get rid of this greedy clown.
7044 2018-07-20 23:04:13 i just gave myself another oil burn making pancakes like dude i don’t even LIKE pancakes that much
7045 2018-07-20 23:03:59 Even he knows you can't dispute a recording! They're going to be burning the midnight oil trying to debunk this one. Good luck guy, LOL
7046 2018-07-20 23:03:52 He’s a real Oil Can Harry
7047 2018-07-20 23:03:34 Off what? Coal that will surely kill y’all prematurely. Gas or oil extraction that’s harmful to the environment? Chemical products manufacturing? Capital in exchange for quality of life sure sounds great.
7048 2018-07-20 23:03:27 Statistics Canada latest inflation number received a boost from higher energy prices, especially gasoline, fuel oil and other fuels. It followed a 2.2 per cent reading for May. So would a carbon tax lower or raise inflation? If I am broke due to taxes or inflation I’ll burn wood.
7049 2018-07-20 23:03:22 Just received my first order from @beardbrand got myself a pocket comb and mustache wax w/ some oil samples. Let the epic facial hair journey begin!
7050 2018-07-20 23:03:21 Oil dads lol
7051 2018-07-20 23:03:09 If only we had new pipelines to get our oil to market to cash in on rising oil prices 
7052 2018-07-20 23:03:00 Oh nice!! I went on an anti viral for two months and it didn’t help sadly. I haven’t tried the coconut oil capsules yet so that’s next!
7053 2018-07-20 23:02:37 Check your use of water and oil. Lifestyle changes. New economy but oil is an element of the economy. Also use sciences in extraction mining

7056 2018-07-20 23:02:13 Nick and the truth about zanu are like oil and water.
7057 2018-07-20 23:01:53 That must be why his regime massacred 900 of them in Lebanon. Or that the Christian founder of the Baath Party was sentenced to death. Do you believe the Romanian Revolution was an American plot to steal Romania's oil [where do you think Hitler's tank fule came from]?
7058 2018-07-20 23:01:49 First it’s not your bill, you forgot to mention Sens Warner , King and Alexander...and you forgot to mention that the money you would fund this with comes from oil and drilling projects that will further destroy our environment. Stupid news reader at 19 should be more informed!
7059 2018-07-20 23:01:30 Does the food include oil residue from the oil pipe line?
7060 2018-07-20 23:01:28 Is it working? Simular issues. Y can't they just legalise cannabis oil.

7063 2018-07-20 23:00:47 USA oil production was already growing under Obama. 45 just whines about NATO funding, again this 2% thing was started under Obama, and even Bush. Selling guns is good for the NRA and USA business, and the Soviet union is defunct. (The attack on Russians was a mistake)
7064 2018-07-20 23:00:46 Who has tried cbd oil? What has it done for you? :)
7065 2018-07-20 23:00:31 Pennsylvania is the only state in the United States that doesn't receive an excise tax from oil companies fracking. That certainly wouldn't be corrected if we elected someone who got $200,000 to say BODY HEAT!

Arabs enjoy to exploit the problem of Palestine in an attempt to cover their tyrannies that still run on "I sell you oil and then construct a few modern cities where escorts from anywhere can be enjoyed by my princes while nations remain hopeless" formula.
7069 2018-07-20 22:59:53 Who got an oil pan I can barrow
7070 2018-07-20 22:59:52 Yes, and I agree, to a point. When he continually attacks the small, independent oil producer in the never ceasing pursuit of lower gas prices, he's costing:
industry related jobs
Restaurant  jobs
Small independent retailers
Consultants
Independent contractors
C - store jobs...
7071 2018-07-20 22:59:43 Okay so if y’all want your face to be super soft after exfoliating mix olive oil and sugar together and exfoliate your face with it!!! It works sooooo good you can thank me later

7089 2018-07-20 22:55:53 been practicing oil painting & i need an easel asap, i’m getting paint everywhere!! 
7090 2018-07-20 22:55:39 if you have dry hair, you’re likely to need a conditioner with natural oils. or after showering you can dry your hair and simply add a little bit of hair oil (morrocan/coconut/almond) or your preference.
7091 2018-07-20 22:55:29 Understand the system is designed to fail so as to enrich certain ppl.all the money borrowed and generated by past regimes what development do we have to show for it? Even during crude oil crisis we didn't feel a thing & we believe it was good economy?bro truth wasn't told then
7092 2018-07-20 22:55:23 That has everything to do with oil. 

Hot oil: good. 

Hot air: bad.
7093 2018-07-20 22:55:21 Followed! And Happy early Birthday!! Have a great one!
7094 2018-07-20 22:55:20 And all our UK oil wealth went to the same rich fuckers, by way of tax cuts, to the very same rich fuckers who are bankrolling brexit now.
Do you start to see a connection?
7095 2018-07-20 22:55:15 Alan just told me I better not put coconut oil In my hair tonight bc he doesn’t want to get oily when we sleep 
7096 2018-07-20 22:55:10 I hit a new level of angry today. Engine blew on car because auto shop screwed up my oil change last week, and wrecker driver told me he’s charging me almost double because “I don’t like you” after I told him I refuse to let him move my car w/ @GEICO dispatched wrecker en route.
7097 2018-07-20 22:54:39 Clearly has no idea what pipelines are used for. No pipelines, no gas stations. Period. How does she think oil gets from the ground to processing plants to refineries? Finally for transport to her?
7098 2018-07-20 22:53:50 They're only dry until you use them to pick up deep fried stuff from the oil.
7099 2018-07-20 22:53:16 Thing is chappy, sterling is now valued about right for the economy. It was ways far stronger than it should have been because it was a petro-currency. We were actually a large exporter of oil for a long time. Now that's come to a natural end there is far less demand for £.
7100 2018-07-20 22:52:57 All I know is I'm fully stocked up on coconut oil so do you want to come over or nah?
7101 2018-07-20 22:52:52 Trump is killing the Russian economy. All they have to sell is oil and vodka. No thanks to the idiot Obama's climate hysteria. Now trump is threatening Putin's energy customers by teaching Europe how to frack for themselves.  Undermining Putin.
7102 2018-07-20 22:52:36 If I see myself as the vessel I’m ok but the moment I see myself as the oil I’m in trouble

7106 2018-07-20 22:51:50 How does it help this country or attract genius types to want to live here if the whole purpose of our economy is to build weapons and hand over our public lands to oil companies to tear up and pollute? Why aren’t WE investing in technology of the future? @realDonaldTrump
7107 2018-07-20 22:51:23 Team Wildlands?! Seems like these boys need some @Alpha_Shaving #TheWildlands Beard Oil!

7109 2018-07-20 22:50:45 The world no longer needs @coinbase in the way we no longer need oil!
7110 2018-07-20 22:50:33 Did you use olive oil?
7111 2018-07-20 22:50:33 Palm oil free all the way!
7112 2018-07-20 22:50:25 Special oil addictions
7113 2018-07-20 22:50:02 I go get a oil change and they trying to tell me all this other shit I needa get like I came here for 1 thing I already gotta pay 60 for this
7114 2018-07-20 22:49:53 YouTube wild. I just watched a 3 min video of this girl telling us how she grows her eyebrows. She made the video like she was bout to tell us something complicated, whole time she just used coconut oil.
7115 2018-07-20 22:49:32 Okawesome 
Now did they test for other chemicals that are used in oil production?
7116 2018-07-20 22:49:23 we were producing more oil than Saudi some years in the 80s. I worked indirectly in the business (offshore). we gave up a lot of our energy security in the last two decades, it seems to me we in europe (not an EU issue) shouldn't be so reliant on russian gas.
7117 2018-07-20 22:49:00 Are you Insiuating Liverpool would survive as a football club without any form of backing? Because.if City can't, Liverpool certainly can't. You say "oil money" as of its a bad thing. Your sponsors have a history of funding terrorism.
7118 2018-07-20 22:49:00 @CadburyUK  Before 2009 you were able to make chocolate without palm oil, and it tasted great.  Why can't you do it again? I'd pay more for palm oil free Cadbury's chocolate, and would feel loads less guilty. #PalmOil #environment #PalmOilFree
7119 2018-07-20 22:48:56 "Let the just man strike me; that is kindness; let him reprove me; it is oil for the head, Which my head shall not refuse, but I will still pray under these afflictions."
7120 2018-07-20 22:48:43 People getting triggered at Liverpool because “they are buying the league”. LFC was about to go into administration 8 years ago. There were no Sheiks or oil tycoons involved. It was all grinding and making the team profitable again. So, fuck y’all
7121 2018-07-20 22:48:39 get on that Born Again Olive Oil tip, it’s been redeemed yo, for extra flavor that will live forever in yo mouth #repentandfrynomore
7122 2018-07-20 22:48:14 That oil is the TRUTH
7123 2018-07-20 22:48:13 通勤車の"減速直後の加速時に断続的な振動が複数回続き、スムーズに加速しない"現象は、車検前は、高速域80-90km/hで発生していたが、車検後は、低速域30-40km/hでも発生するようになり、状態悪化。その後、呉工業"OIL SYSTEM MOTOR REV 多走行車用"をエンジンオイル添加後は、低速域での振動は軽減。
7124 2018-07-20 22:47:48 What kind of oil?
7125 2018-07-20 22:47:45 Where did i say that I'm an Economist?
However, you know that probably we also bought isis oil. In 2015 it was not difficult to smuggle oil through the Tal Abyad border. (And through some tunnels even to Syria) what do you expect?
7126 2018-07-20 22:47:41 One thing you won't see. Masked protesters beating the crap out of ppl, burning flags and spitting on ppl. One striking diff btwn right and left.
7127 2018-07-20 22:47:23 Also.  Its all about the fries done in peanut oil that set up the burger at 5 guys. You gotta do the whole thing!
7128 2018-07-20 22:47:18 I believe that the eggs did not have oil, @RosalynSphinx it is correct??
7129 2018-07-20 22:47:14 The black chick was by far the best then Sporty, the rest seemed a little conceited.
7130 2018-07-20 22:47:04 An owner of an oil and petroleum company has started following me. I think this is because my back garden in Kingstanding is juicy for energy.  I look forward to hearing from you,  oil and petroleum person.
7131 2018-07-20 22:47:00 Often find myself using an analogy discussing a concept with someone...and wildly flailing for terms in the analogy space to continue the discussion. 

I compared something to an “oil well” today and five minutes later was talking of “dilithium crystals” and “warp cores”.
7132 2018-07-20 22:46:58 I see no point in a highlight this summer cause the way my pores produce oil and sweat you can see me from the the 50 yard line. #makeup #oily #summerglow
7133 2018-07-20 22:46:47 Chef Skinner cut up some acne, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was some  human flesh, along with gravy.
7134 2018-07-20 22:46:44 They said rain or shine but I highly doubt they meant thunderstorms.
7135 2018-07-20 22:46:40 No doubt the study will find that The harmful noice is caused by Oil Tankers making deliveries in in Eastern Canada ports!
7136 2018-07-20 22:46:23 Can my promised land be flowing with maple syrup and extra virgin olive oil instead of milk and honey, please?
7137 2018-07-20 22:46:21 In a book titled “Olives; the Noble Fruit”, the author points out that Spain supplies Italy with olive oil or Italy couldn’t export.
7138 2018-07-20 22:45:57 I'm currently in the middle-east. The GCC is a big collaborative block here. I'm in Qatar. They will not admit as much, but Qatar is suffering badly, due to the current embargo. Qatar can pump wealth out of the ground, yet still, they are suffering. We gave up our oil wealth.
7139 2018-07-20 22:45:43 Olive oil and balsamic vinegar for the dressing?
7140 2018-07-20 22:45:02 Just like various persons were accused of being paid by Saddam (Food for Oil program). Of course they had the 'intelligence' that ppl like you printed. Except it was complete crap. They thought no one would turn up to talk back. Galloway did.
7141 2018-07-20 22:45:00 For dry skin ;

7142 2018-07-20 22:44:59 This guy at the tire shop is a dick, he’s harassing the woman behind the counter cause he doesn’t believe them when they said they’ll put the oil he requested... my dude... this is their job. Fuck off
7143 2018-07-20 22:44:57 @YogaMoonGoddess now i gotta spend rest of day looking for sexy yoga music that goes with oil ....
7144 2018-07-20 22:44:54 Have you been to C&M Auto Service Inc. Glenview, IL...they picked up my car, from the Chamber office for my oil change!! What service!! And a lovely facility!!
7145 2018-07-20 22:44:54 Somehow I managed to spill a closed, still full bottle of lavender essential oil onto a peach, in the egg cup of my refrigerator door. For days the peach has been transforming into potpourri gel. The egg cup is dry. I cannot explain anything.
7146 2018-07-20 22:44:46 Guys what can I use ukukhipha inyongo?. Please don't tell me about castor oil
7147 2018-07-20 22:44:35 t’as testé la bi oil ?
7148 2018-07-20 22:44:35 What are those six countries? I'm assuming Luxembourg is one. Oil and Gas are out!! We eat a lot of Scottish fish in England, but I've heard that Dutch fish is quite good. Perhaps we should get better links with that Country.
7149 2018-07-20 22:44:32 is there sportball tonight???
7150 2018-07-20 22:44:24 Like I told @caitiedelaney , I can't say, plus the entire recipe. Forgot to mention I used coconut oil on the pan though and added a TINY  bit of veg oil to the batter
7151 2018-07-20 22:44:18 If you like a lot of mustard oil on your pastel de nata, join our club!
7152 2018-07-20 22:44:16 Been in ur shoes and what people are saying it's TRUE don't use heat for awhile I waited 2 months stop using things with sulfa.try olive oil warming up and leave it in ur hair for 20 minutes then shower .and just let time pass it will heal ,but not overnight
7153 2018-07-20 22:44:07 Paid 150 dollars for an oil change yesterday, now today my car is leaking oil 
7154 2018-07-20 22:44:01 i’m at the oil change place and the guy walked to the front of my car thinking I had my  license plate in the front  oops 
7155 2018-07-20 22:43:56 Well technically there’s palm oil money from the guy who owns the other 50% of Salford... Does that count?
7156 2018-07-20 22:43:56 Remember that one time Kisa replaced Onodera's coffee with motor oil.

Yeah him too.
7157 2018-07-20 22:43:55 Lol it should ! Keep up with deep conditions and use oils too. Black Castor oil
7158 2018-07-20 22:43:50 Hubs is roasting coconut and making coconut oil caramel. My house smells like HEAVEN!!
7159 2018-07-20 22:43:35 Strange, strange are the dynamics of oil and the ways of oilmen #ThomasPynchon
7160 2018-07-20 22:43:17 Andrew is a  hairstylist that likes Chili oil on their tomatoe pizza with cognac
7161 2018-07-20 22:43:13 Cameroon doesn’t have as much oil as Libya and the difference is. Gaddafi had a vision for Africa & refused his country resources to be exploited. Paul Biya on the other hand doesn’t care.
7162 2018-07-20 22:42:46 This game pisses me tf off LOL. I'm in a waiting room (getting oil changed) and I'm trying not to rage in front of these people
7163 2018-07-20 22:42:43 the poppy once meant respect. For all of us. Your participation in murdering innocents has left it blood stained. Shame on you and your bloodthirsty oil dollar.

7167 2018-07-20 22:41:38 Are you for real ?? The man who killed millions in the Middle East for oil  ? George Bush 's yes man . Israel yes man , a man who will sell his soul to the highest bidder. He should be in The Hague
7168 2018-07-20 22:41:20 This includes olive oil brownies, right?
7169 2018-07-20 22:41:17 Cranked up boost, popped oil hose, glowing turbo =  melted gearbox case made a hole in the tarmac best bit, the insurers may have paid twice 
7170 2018-07-20 22:41:11 Why doesn’t car insurance work like health insurance where oil changes and other basic maintenance are covered
7171 2018-07-20 22:40:58 @spann @jpdice_Fox6 @JerryWVTM13 I’m going to go ahead and thank you and your staffs for burning the midnight oil tonight. Thanks for keeping us informed and hopefully safe.

7177 2018-07-20 22:40:42 Oil based or waterbase?
7178 2018-07-20 22:40:39 However, a well deserved shout out to @MarineTraffic which also provides amazing data about oil tankers!
7179 2018-07-20 22:40:38 I mean, we work? and keep the country fed and running? 

But it's extremely funny since the same nationalities that run these restaurants are the ones who work in the oil companies that gave them their wealth, and actually every other single sector in country.
7180 2018-07-20 22:40:07 New Echo Electuary product drop including 4 different Honey tinctures! We also got a huge oil re supply of NWK and Botanical Labratories
7181 2018-07-20 22:39:59 I fried onion, hot pepper, mushrooms, garlic, basil, oregano, and thyme (just a touch!) in a shit ton of olive oil then added mashed tomatoes that I cooked down yesterday and a handful of olives.
7182 2018-07-20 22:39:54 This was how I had glistening skin at the club in college before shimmer oil was a thing
7183 2018-07-20 22:39:50 So if your net spend for the past seasons are 500m. You didnt make money from selling. You are still paying 200k a week to players. and you still want to tell me without oil money your club would survive from sponsorship, merchandises and tickets?
7184 2018-07-20 22:39:50 Everytime I get a oil change they want to add on other shit 
7185 2018-07-20 22:39:48 What do ya think of CBD oil? Started it yesterday for the first time. Been the best day of my life for years. Slept like a baby and anxiety free all day.
7186 2018-07-20 22:39:47 Thou anoints my head with oil; my cup runneth over 
7187 2018-07-20 22:39:45 They call me oil field trash. That’s alright with me
7188 2018-07-20 22:39:44 There is an anointing for victory I will be praying for everyone join me live in 5 minutes share this post move quickly. There is a fresh oil flowing. #PGM
7189 2018-07-20 22:39:15 Commercials have taught me which type of dish soap I can rely on if I want to wash oil off of baby ducks.

But, which one is best for, you know, washing my dishes? 
7190 2018-07-20 22:38:59 Actually, majority of victims of ISIS are ordinary Syrians. I hope you know ISIS collaborated with Assad, supplied him with oil & always had safe passage through regime's lines.
7191 2018-07-20 22:38:51 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
7192 2018-07-20 22:38:33 Marinated in olive oil, garlic & rosemary then grill yum
7193 2018-07-20 22:38:26 I work 16 jobs. Believe that & I have some offshore oil rights in N. Dakota to sell you. Ms. Warren is about as sane as Ms. Goldberg. Next up....Chuck S-who will up the ante to 8, or 16, or 24 jobs. Like the old song, "We all be working in a coalmine."
7194 2018-07-20 22:38:22 Please, someone has got to be seriously burning the midnight oil out there to stay afield of the "competitors" including the rogue AI elements themselves. Ok, just my two cents.
7195 2018-07-20 22:38:21 pakai baby oil bisa ya? mau beli cleansing oil mahal banget seharga buku latihan un :(((
7196 2018-07-20 22:38:21 Agreed on money--would be nice to have good campaign finance law for county. Right now only players on the board resisting Big Ag, Big Oil, and Big Hospitality is Labor and @MontereyCoDems and yes, we have our own challenges.  How about looking at 460s?
7197 2018-07-20 22:38:18 Mom had to make an emergency beard oil run for me
7198 2018-07-20 22:37:44 I only did 2 trades. One going short oil. The other going long $amzn. Both worked out quickly at open. I don’t stay for hours these days.
7199 2018-07-20 22:37:35 Well the kickbacks from oil and gas corps make up any difference from gubbament pay
7200 2018-07-20 22:37:33 you know that @NatResources @RepRobBishop is looking to push his natural gas and other oil interests to take over the @AEEONLINE, right?
7201 2018-07-20 22:37:28 just go to dellwood tire in lockport next time!! my boyfriend works there and I promise you him and the other guy do not want to find extra work to do LOL they’ll do your oil change and send you on the way
7202 2018-07-20 22:37:13 Is that what kid do instead of swapping blood, rub oil on each other?
7203 2018-07-20 22:37:05 Well played indeed! “Black blood of the earth”,  “you mean oil?” “No! Black blood of the earth!”
7204 2018-07-20 22:37:04 Dave Rubin is a snake oil salesman
7205 2018-07-20 22:36:57 who in and around blockchain isn't :) Good HR is so rare and terms like dev are equal to gold or oil now.
7206 2018-07-20 22:36:18 How the fuck they going to have us at work with no fans, and not get us water, and still having to deal with the heat from under the car and that hot as oil knowing it was 106 outside like bruh nahhh.
7207 2018-07-20 22:35:54 The one where they're on the oil rig with the ringing phone
7208 2018-07-20 22:35:46 [Paid Ad]

Tired of your son talking back? Does that little rat just not know when to shut his trap? Try Omega focus 3 with fish oil. Good luck suckers.
7209 2018-07-20 22:35:42 so the stupid people  do not start wind and solar power to run desalination plants to water the city and farm land but rather rely on big oil big auto and big Trump that there is no problem.  They will all die
7210 2018-07-20 22:35:26 @adamcarolla I'm starting the NSNC diet. How do you eat on this diet. And what oil do you talk abiut?
7211 2018-07-20 22:35:05 Fried bananas with olive oil, cinnamon and honey
7212 2018-07-20 22:34:51 It’s true that everyone wants something different from Putin. Trump wants peace. Un wants oil. China wants a pact. Iran wants nukes. Hillary wants more cash. Schumer?  I think he wants a date.
7213 2018-07-20 22:34:47 I love love love essential oils

I also love hearing people’s fave ways to use the oils  what’s your fave oil or way to use them. Tell me all the things. 

Special points for travel must haves.

Post below  and THANKS
7214 2018-07-20 22:34:32 Oh yes any garlic or olive oil based product!
7215 2018-07-20 22:34:32 Seeing their username, I have a feeling of which group is going to be "offended"by this movie
7216 2018-07-20 22:34:24 Yeah right. BP when will you clean up the oil spillage in Nigeria. Its bn over ten years and the communities you destroyed are still waiting for you clean up their water supply. So when?
7217 2018-07-20 22:34:21 while simultaneously rubbing my taint with infused coconut oil
7218 2018-07-20 22:34:11 A strong £ goes against exporters.

Food costs are high because of EU tariffs.

Oil price has been a lot higher in previous years and price is dependent on global politics.

Jobs: employment at record highs. Lots of inward investment.
7219 2018-07-20 22:34:08 Yes, it's the balance of oils. I want the lauric acid in coconut oil, because I find it soothes my gut but also plenty of the highly energizing MCTs as well. It's madness.
7220 2018-07-20 22:34:08 It's not only oil companies it your helicopter rides! Your jet, jets in general. You can't fool all the people!
7221 2018-07-20 22:34:03 Absolutely. In fact it was Ali al Naomi’s Vision that Aramco should be more than just a developer of Saudi oil that has brought such prosperity. I write about this in my book, #SaudiInc
But still, this is a cautionary tale for an authoritarian gov for what NOT to do
7222 2018-07-20 22:34:00 The shame of BHO GDP being 1 in itself is bad enough but add the fact what kept it in the black was the fracking of oil which he fought staunchly against. If it weren't for the fracking, our GDP probably would be in the red.
7223 2018-07-20 22:33:56 * Bomb Syria killing 200 Russians
* Deliver weapons to the Ukraine
* Tell Germany to reconsider buying Russian oil
* Holding large military Maneuvers In Poland and Lithuania

Looks like Trump is in Putin's pocket alright.
Do you get all your copy from CNN?
7224 2018-07-20 22:33:48 This was my main glove till senior year.  I’ll never forget the model number “Dale Murphy” RBG36.  The thing weighed 10 pounds from all the glove oil. But I could field with that thing for some reason.
7225 2018-07-20 22:33:47 *goes to arts & crafts fair in bayong smelling like weed and lavender oil
7226 2018-07-20 22:33:36 *oil 
7227 2018-07-20 22:33:30 i dont have perfect skin but i use anthropology's purity cleanser every night n do sheet masks like once or twice a week, i also put 5 drops of rosehip oil on my face after i wash it before bed

7229 2018-07-20 22:33:12 just found out mcnuggets aren't vegetarian because they use beef stock in the oil to fry them. what the fuck
7230 2018-07-20 22:33:11 If it helps, I did Maui Thai for many years with 2 British champions, my injuries I healed with Thai oil ( mainly my shins but on occasion my ankles) what took me a week to recover, I did in 2 days with apple cider vinegar, into a sock. I was shocked, especially 15 years later.
7231 2018-07-20 22:33:07 oil don’t be moisturizing shit!!
7232 2018-07-20 22:32:56 It had to do with power and oil
7233 2018-07-20 22:32:22 Lmao I’d roast your DE but you’re vq fam. At least you don’t consume hella oil like a rev up 
7234 2018-07-20 22:32:13 I just want to say. If I say anything that hurts or offends anyone. I truly don’t mean it. Working for the oil field life for 7 years really gives you a different sense of humor. We just BS each other all fuckin day until it’s time to be serious. I love y’all.
7235 2018-07-20 22:32:10 Now wondering if Computer Models are showing a correlation with Dinosaur Extinction and Big Oil? (Just something been on my mind awhile)
7236 2018-07-20 22:31:56 For he’s with me
He’s rod and staff
They comfort me
They prepare a table before me
In the presence of my enemies 
They anointed my head with oil
My cup over flows
Surely, his goodness and mercy shall follow me
All the days of my life
7237 2018-07-20 22:31:42 You need to bring your own oil these days, I think
7238 2018-07-20 22:31:26 Climate Scientists haven’t lost their jobs and, at least in Canada, oil production is higher and increasing. Yes your correct, climate change is setttled science, some millionaires are spreading fake science and distorting facts to benefits themselves at the expense of others.
7239 2018-07-20 22:31:18 @DeltaOilAndGas Our architectural firm would like to send invitations to the seminar in Algeria that will take place at the end of September to the managers of Delta Oil to whom we would also like to submit our innovative project to build a school for autistic children.

7240 2018-07-20 22:31:14 Irving, do you realize that while The benchmark WTI oil price closed today at US$66, the Canadian benchmark WCS closed at US$44pb. The discount largely reflects inability to move Cdn oil because of regulatory stalling of pipeline investment.
7241 2018-07-20 22:30:46 Real Manuka honey (nature's antibiotic).  Great in hot tea.  Great right from a spoon. That and oregano oil (natural anti viral) soft gels kept me from having to take antibiotics.

7243 2018-07-20 22:30:09 Followers of justice for these girls a glimmer of hope FBI HAS NOT received all my evidence yet, sent it to DOJ instead...now we are cooking with oil
7244 2018-07-20 22:30:07 If being young and naive means smart enough to not vote for positions who are paid off by the oil and gas industry, then call me young and naive. #climatechange #resistmarinereast #RiseTogether #youngandnaive
7245 2018-07-20 22:29:43 HEADLINE: More people sickened by parasite in outbreak linked to McDonald's salads

That's why I only eat their fries - that hot oil works wonders on parasites
7246 2018-07-20 22:29:35 Personal attack is all you have. For a snake oil salesman whom has to pad his credential with fake degrees from a fake college, this is pretty delusional. Arguments based on solid science is not libel, but you probably don't know that either.
7247 2018-07-20 22:29:32 I make my food with motor oil
7248 2018-07-20 22:29:19 Where do you think the majority of revenue for that fund comes from? Answer: oil and gas from AB and SK.
7249 2018-07-20 22:29:19 As opposed to Büsh/Cheney who got a war out of a lie for oil?  Ironic, what you get incensed about, Bill.
7250 2018-07-20 22:29:17 @marketcall what oil and gas stocks is your guest short?
7251 2018-07-20 22:29:16 @annie_vams hi.   Can I have a list of the oil you have?
7252 2018-07-20 22:29:14 You might also like an oil cleanser if Aesop makes that! Also now that face oil is on my must try list.
7253 2018-07-20 22:29:12 Peppermint oil!
7254 2018-07-20 22:29:09 I’m such a big girl now I took my car for it’s first oil change

7256 2018-07-20 22:28:29 Fri. NYT xword sports reclue: "Getty oil, e.g." can be "Philip in 'Moneyball.'"  Three letters.  Go.
7257 2018-07-20 22:28:15 I know I’m late to the party but I finally purchased an oil diffuser. If any of you have favorite scent combos you’d care to share I’d appreciate it. TIA 
7258 2018-07-20 22:28:07 Kades oil temp hits 220.... *pushes programmer out of viewing site
7259 2018-07-20 22:28:03 Warner has been 'bout to pee his pants since the Russia farce started.
7260 2018-07-20 22:27:40 Oh, Mr. Kenney is still like a broken record when it comes to the supposed Liberal/NDP killing of the oil industry. Global prices are irrelevant ;-).
7261 2018-07-20 22:27:30 Evening primrose oil capsules!! I only took 2 of them after buying them and I went into labor naturally!
7262 2018-07-20 22:27:25 I will recomend forte oil
7263 2018-07-20 22:27:18 Nigga poured motor oil on her I’m cryingggg 
7264 2018-07-20 22:27:17 
7265 2018-07-20 22:27:10 I don't agree with your politics. But I also have colitis.
I tried C.B.D. oil.
No flare ups no symptoms in over six mos.
7266 2018-07-20 22:26:34 I'm screwed, love my CBD oil for gout pain, no other effective substitutes!
7267 2018-07-20 22:26:28 I agree oil doesn’t care about any of that stuff... curious though, what do you do to help your decisions in trading?
7268 2018-07-20 22:26:27 - brushing your teeth with olive oil 
- damp toothbrush in baking soda & brush
- rub & leave a mint leaf, orange peel, or coffee whitener on your teeth for 10 minutes & brush regularly
7269 2018-07-20 22:26:21 Andalusia, a Spanish región, produces 1/3 of the Worlds production. And just Jaén, one of Spain's 50 provinces, produces 1/6 of the World's output of olive oil!
7270 2018-07-20 22:26:18 Tillerson had ONE JOB & he failed.  That is why he was asked to leave.  Putin selected him to remove the sanctions on the oil fields that his old company owns.  WIN - WIN for both.  TILLERSON FAILED so Putin wanted him out
7271 2018-07-20 22:26:12 Getting oil changes with my mechanics is therapeutic and educational.

They were teaching me how to ride a skateboard. #mechanics
7272 2018-07-20 22:26:07 Lmao the guy in the bodega was like how women now a days can’t even fry an egg and was like “very good mami “ when I went to buy oil 
7273 2018-07-20 22:26:07 Really, the last I checked killings in Nigeria started years ago and both previous administrations including that of former ruling party that led this nation for 16 turbulent years with nothing to show when we had oil boom
7274 2018-07-20 22:25:42 I Use Coconut  Oil For Literally Everything 
7275 2018-07-20 22:25:34 if they’re really distressing you, bio oil works wonders for getting rid of stretch marks
7276 2018-07-20 22:25:29 The simple truth is this... Until renewable energy is 100% effective and cost efficient, oil and gas will be needed.
You can rail against it all you like, but reality sucks sometimes.

And pipelines are the safest way to move said products.
7277 2018-07-20 22:25:29 I don't think I like the smell of this new beard oil
7278 2018-07-20 22:25:23 Purchased my Faceshop rice water bright foam cleanser and oil cleanser! I got it as a sample months ago and it did wonders for my skin 
7279 2018-07-20 22:25:19 Wanted to invest in an oil company or any good network marketing. Any one available to help me?
7280 2018-07-20 22:25:18 Drama....give me a break. We are obligated to support NATO. If you are so concerned stop buying oil and gas from Russia.
7281 2018-07-20 22:25:14 I’ll embrace the horses, humidity, oil mines..... any other lazy racial stereotype I’ve missed??? 
BEEF?
7282 2018-07-20 22:24:59 i've been waiting for an oil change for 5 hours 
7283 2018-07-20 22:24:39 That’s that good baby oil gel he using
7284 2018-07-20 22:24:10 2: The #US never had a strategy for #Syria or the Middle East except to steal the oil if it could (or consumption, otherwise). Invasion of #Iraq = precursor to so-called Arab Spring and expansion of #Turkish Empire = US has failed entirely, it is basically a spectator.
7285 2018-07-20 22:24:06 Never off duty, pouring that oil on the troubled waters..you were made for it!
7286 2018-07-20 22:24:02 Yep.  Oil lamps and candles.  Dirt roads.  Small ferry barges because there will be no more bridges. Sadly though we will also lose rail travel because the tracks need to be replaced.
7287 2018-07-20 22:23:45 I’m so thankful my dad taught me little things about cars, like putting in coolant, oil changes, and changing tires. 
7288 2018-07-20 22:23:44 Oh no Wynne is no choice of mine and it's not just her it's all of them big oil plays all sides! My problem with Ford is his inability and refusal to answer even simple questions and lack of fiscal plan of any sort.
7289 2018-07-20 22:23:40 Olive oil yang bagus apee??? Dari wardah ke tuh? Yang kecik warne ijau ke tuh??? Nanti kite cubee ye kwkwkw
7290 2018-07-20 22:23:37 As I type this, I got butter, coconut oil, and MCT oil in my coffee. It's the perfect storm.
7291 2018-07-20 22:23:01 I will recommend coconut oil since his head is now hard
7292 2018-07-20 22:22:52 While a agree the socialist government of Venezuela did mismanage the economy by not diversiving from fuel the ironic this is that it's the capitalist idea of a boom and bust economy that lead to the collapse in oil prices which tanked the Venezuelan economy.
7293 2018-07-20 22:22:48 Por favor, eso es un himno m8!

7294 2018-07-20 22:22:35 You go, @rose_strauss ! If "young and naive" means we're figuring out that we need to start replacing our leaders who are bought out by Big Oil, then consider me #YoungAndNaive!
7295 2018-07-20 22:22:32 Give the man some oil
7296 2018-07-20 22:22:24 I have had a hellish day at work.  Since I am no longer drinking alcohol, I am going to have to hit the ole CBD oil and listen to some meditation tapes til bedtime.  I need a fresh start
7297 2018-07-20 22:21:55 If being “young and naive” means wanting politicians to protect clean drinking water rather than take bribes from coal, oil, and gas CEOs who pollute it, then call me #YoungAndNaive
7298 2018-07-20 22:21:42 I kinda wanna play w oil paints but idk hoW
7299 2018-07-20 22:21:37 he should oil wrestle with Mayweather 4 charity

7301 2018-07-20 22:20:10 Ahaa, so you're n artist? Oil on canvas 
7302 2018-07-20 22:19:45 Forreal? Can’t wait to see what happens when the oil money runs out 
7303 2018-07-20 22:19:33 #IndianFire 500 acres. Values at risk, 1 residence and 2 oil holding tanks. No Lead Aircraft available. @Matt_Kroschel #wildfire
7304 2018-07-20 22:19:19 I’m on board with the pipe idea, but it needs a clever name on the side that contrasts oh-so-slightly with your just-visible tattoo. Beard, of course, with beard oil on the desk in place of ink for your quill.
7305 2018-07-20 22:18:32 Need more oil for my pen
7306 2018-07-20 22:18:28 coconut oil is overrated tbh
7307 2018-07-20 22:18:23 Rinse your rice, 2:1 cup ratio for water to rice, add salt+olive oil always, season if desired, boil covered for half an hour exactly on medium high heat stirring occasionally, remove when done and place paper towel on top to remove excess moisture. Youll get it perfect I promise
7308 2018-07-20 22:18:06 Just throw some mousse or coconut oil in your wet hair, tie em up and sleep while the magic happens! I hope it works for you! I get so excited about lazy styles! 
7309 2018-07-20 22:18:03 Also realised that you could probably run an old school diesel engine on Nutella, as there's fuck loads of palm oil in it.

7312 2018-07-20 22:17:55 What made you start explaining?  Did she look confused? Did she say something that gave you that impression?  If I have to listen to 4 hours of what Alice told Sheril Bill did.....She can deal with 10 minutes on how an internal combustion engine works and why oil is important.
7313 2018-07-20 22:17:51 Tbh I just usually have tea tree oil on hand to dab on my piercings when they get irritated
7314 2018-07-20 22:17:44 haha, did the front hubs on our (FUCKING HORRIBLE VEHICLE) 06 grand prix gtp. Confirm the 10mm's. I used half a can of the penetrating oil stuff before i even tried, they came out pretty ez. The fucking rust everywhere though. on an at-the-time 7 year old car. ugh
7315 2018-07-20 22:17:22 If I pull up to your shop for an oil change, im here for an oil change. Nothing more, nothing less. I dont give af if my car is on fire. IM HERE FOR AN OIL CHANGE.
7316 2018-07-20 22:17:14 And the US have been ensuring oil is traded in dollars!
7317 2018-07-20 22:17:13 Hey someone bring me an oil cartridge to one of these shows
7318 2018-07-20 22:17:00 Fry corn tortillas in oil next time! Sooo much better than the prepackaged taco shells!
7319 2018-07-20 22:16:52 Well, last time OPEC increased supply (few weeks ago), oil price raised a lot.
7320 2018-07-20 22:16:41 So wynne for 15 years had her elections funded by big oil not green energy so she didn’t bother having govt buildings have solar power, is what you are saying and you are ok with that?
7321 2018-07-20 22:16:37 Yep - also good at getting oil marks off driveway  baking soda n vinegar shifts all the brown burnt bits off bottom of pans n a cup of white vinegar into the empty washing machine on a rinse cycle gets rid of all the scummy build up n makes it sparkly
7322 2018-07-20 22:16:24 I use olive oil too 
7323 2018-07-20 22:16:21 18 - old enough to be sent into the military and fight an oil war.
7324 2018-07-20 22:16:13 She acting like Chanyeol ripped off his shirt and poured oil all over his muscles. Like girl chill he was only flexing his arms!!
7325 2018-07-20 22:16:10 The east doesn’t like it now that steel ,aerospace,and auto are under threat but have been silent as their beloved sockboy crushed the oil industry in Alberta and Saskatchewan

7331 2018-07-20 22:14:56 I mean it’s different if im asking you for A roast compared to you just randomly going like “Your fursona looks like they only bathe once a month with skunk oil”
7332 2018-07-20 22:14:46 My hair only like it for hot oil treatments...
7333 2018-07-20 22:14:39 U have no proof just swallow whole the podesta story of Russia -why did DJT call out Merkel for buying russian oil if he's licking putins boots? Your in some kind of la la land
7334 2018-07-20 22:14:34 Some one go with me to get an oil change please
7335 2018-07-20 22:14:22 Alternate but tasty variations 
for banh mi fusion

Add Greek spices to bloom in warmed Pompeiian
olive oil along w/chickpea flour, parsley/lemon juice
Grated dried cucumber & plain yogurt blended

Feta cheese in middle of Turkey burgers
7336 2018-07-20 22:14:18 No Canadian really wants it..just want the $$$ to buy the AtV, Boat and Skidoo..Should of been a Teacher instead of a 3000 week oil pipeline dude walkin the woodz!
7337 2018-07-20 22:14:15 You sold America for a 19% stake of oil in Russia??? What did you give Putin in return?? You owe us answers #TraitorTrump Every Republican needs to be thrown out of the country!!
7338 2018-07-20 22:14:10 I’m annoyed that none of y’all draw with oil pastels so i don’t have anyone to talk about it with.
7339 2018-07-20 22:14:06 You eat sunflower oil?
7340 2018-07-20 22:14:06 I really hope the oil and gas industry doesn’t assassinate you over this tweet
7341 2018-07-20 22:13:51 Where can you get cbd oil for pain #cbd #pain
7342 2018-07-20 22:13:46 And might if Congress was not bribed by big oil not too..
.
7343 2018-07-20 22:13:42 The one I had it was probably 3 mins till cab glass blew out from heat. Got out to look and couldn't get back into cab before heat was too much. It goes pretty damn fast once fuel and oil lines get involved. I'm still amazed at how fast it all happened.
7344 2018-07-20 22:13:35 Yum! If you ever wanna try Arab style hummus you should try Cortas. They come in a can and I think HEB on Trenton has them (if not, the universal market on dove). Mix it with some olive oil and paprika and mmm!!

7347 2018-07-20 22:12:10 "Western" values like bombing for oil, meddling in foreign governments, overthrowing democratically elected governments...? You know, those things that all of these refugees are fleeing. Stop bombing & meddling- I'll bet these folks would love to stay in their own nations.
7348 2018-07-20 22:12:09 Needed items to apply to the area :

- vitamin E oil 
- rose hip seed oil 
- coconut oil
- argan oil
- aloe vera
- egg whites
- raw white sugar 
- almond oil + lemon juice
7349 2018-07-20 22:11:55 Like in the cooked rice? Or the rice toasted in oil before cooking?
7350 2018-07-20 22:11:53 I have champagne and mct oil in my hair good bye JGO
7351 2018-07-20 22:11:50 I feel like this is how it was discovered that you can drink cow's milk. 

An abundance of a liquid + solitude in the woods + free time = experimentation.

Maybe you can find a new use for peppermint oil?

7353 2018-07-20 22:11:16 Our future lies with renewables, tide, wind, geothermal or new wave fast breeder fusion reactors. Coal and probably gas and oil are dead,or looking pessimistically our planet and us may be!
7354 2018-07-20 22:11:03 And the price of gasoline and heating oil....!  Bring it down so people don't freeze and can get where they need to go. Winter is coming.
7355 2018-07-20 22:10:52 It's prob the butter flavored seasoning salt & oil they use. I worked at a theater and that's all mixed with the kernels

7358 2018-07-20 22:10:40 Went out and bought myself an essential oil diffuser and now my room smells of oranges with a hint of lemon. 
7359 2018-07-20 22:10:36 What would you prefer,David? #ableg NDP govt to say economy looking up but it's shite b/c folks still suffer job loss/low pay from 44 yrs+ of PC's making AB depend on oil prices? Govt says much more needs doing & tout good news,as you would do if you ever formed govt (unlikely)
7360 2018-07-20 22:10:31 I’m glad @subaru_usa has free oil changes for life

7363 2018-07-20 22:10:11 Great job, POTUS. You know how good your doing by how much they hate you. Russia is good for us on an oil level. These other punks just spew crap because they are full of shite.

1 We have the least Globally integrated economy 
2.We are energy independent 
3.We have 566 Billon Dollar deficit with the world
4. We portect oil routes in the persian gulf for free even though we dont need the oil anymore.
7367 2018-07-20 22:09:36 ok! so here's the easiest best salad you can make. buy: arugula, 1 lemon, pine nuts, 1 Roma tomato, olive oil (if you don't have that). Brown the pine nuts. chop the tomato, put it on the arugula, add toasted pine nuts, squeeze some lemon, drizzle oil, add a pinch of salt
7368 2018-07-20 22:09:33 Ok so here's what you do: get some puy lentils, mix in some feta cheese and fresh coriander (cilantro). Add some olive oil, like one glug. Karl, are you vegetarian?

7372 2018-07-20 22:09:07 If being young and naive means not wanting new oil pipelines that threaten land, water, health, safety, and our future, then call me #YoungAndNaive.
7373 2018-07-20 22:08:37 So that they don't have to side with him when it matters? I wonder at what cost. Huge oil import at a fixed price regardless of the market would be a good start.
7374 2018-07-20 22:08:35 I say again when big oil fills the election bank accounts and hires politicians after they leave public office not to mention the tax dollars and jobs it is hard to kick the habit! Now let me askyou what do wedo when those oil reserves run out andwe haven't invested in thesetechs
7375 2018-07-20 22:08:18 I'm sorry but this was a very poorly informed article, the sanctions will in fact be worse this time as oil exports are to be brought down to zero. The regime has very little support among the populace as proven by the recent protests, pressure will cause the regime to fall.
7376 2018-07-20 22:08:16 Create a leak in the line feeding oil to the turbine, so that oil will fall on the hot steam pipe and cause a fire.

7378 2018-07-20 22:06:49 Olive oil+honey+lemon juice+brown sugar. 2-3 times a week
7379 2018-07-20 22:06:40 @Chris_Tanaka Did you ask Rob where the money is supposed to come from? Did he tell you it was from guaranteed subsidization of future private energy (gas/oil) production in those parks & fed lands? Or, did you just toe the line & ask whatever his staff prompted? #BeAccountable
7380 2018-07-20 22:06:31 Nasty people for sure,  they forgot oil was a limited gift
7381 2018-07-20 22:06:30 Let me give you an example of wh yyour wrong if Iran and Saudi Arabia went to war in the persian gulf how would China and Japan get their oil? If russia stopped giving oil Eastern Europe in a war what would happen?
7382 2018-07-20 22:06:03 "Pour Your Oil" @thejoshuarogers . Praise Drive. KHVN/Heaven 97 | khvnam. com
7383 2018-07-20 22:05:57 Haters will hate, no oil money here... Move along nothing to see
7384 2018-07-20 22:05:55 Also... no one pays for this stance.  No elite industrialists from any sector are challenged financially by this.  So wall street, oil, drugs, are all happy to distract with this.
7385 2018-07-20 22:05:45 rinse with COLD water, coconut oil, dab lil deodorant =

7387 2018-07-20 22:05:42 It would have been a paper exercise to funnel sales of Scotland’s oil through
7388 2018-07-20 22:05:42 I blend Turkey w/a marinade of crushed Rosemary, cimmi churrie & Mojo seasoned olive oil to add the fat w/out losing cohesiveness for the turkey burger or chop stick skewered footballs a la Kofta. Been known to wrap par roasted bacon around par cooked ones & broil on both sides.
7389 2018-07-20 22:05:35 Gettin the car serviced for an oil change been here since 12:40pm STILL WAITING  its 3pm rn and I haven't had breakfast I'm HANGRY
7390 2018-07-20 22:05:04 Soybeans are know not cause cancer!  Soybean oil is bad for you.  You wrote this same twitter six months ago and I am responding the same. Americans don’t need hormone destroying foods!
7391 2018-07-20 22:04:37 I have a relative who says “earl” instead of oil. Turlit instead of toilet. One day after frying chicken cutlets she yelled out “Don’t flush the earl down the turlit”! Huh??? Hahahahaha
7392 2018-07-20 22:04:34 Cut my thumb at work and it won’t stop bleeding plus 190 degree oil splashed me in the face. Today was not a good day
7393 2018-07-20 22:04:33 I’m really ab to change my oil in my nice ass sweat pants bc I don’t have any pants at my dads 
7394 2018-07-20 22:04:32 @roxyell1995 Whens the oil pics happening
7395 2018-07-20 22:04:16 Baltimore is latest city to file climate lawsuit against major oil companies
7396 2018-07-20 22:04:11 Cbd oil?
7397 2018-07-20 22:03:52 "Oil Tot"! Your "Teddy Bear" likeness has a lot of sex appeal with your latest #selfie! I love it!
7398 2018-07-20 22:03:38 Oil changed today. Car is in great shape otherwise too. Love my #FordFocus
7399 2018-07-20 22:03:38 Annoying innit. Such a load of bollocks! My mum’s got lung cancer with secondaries in the brain. If I get one more quack contacting me about some crap snake oil... I will not be held responsible!  Also. I read your blog and cried a lot. Big love to you and your family xx
7400 2018-07-20 22:03:17 Take serious issue with this paper excerpt. It’s no coincidence institutional money moved out of real estate at the same time oil prices shot up. Who the hell else debt financed what ultimately became the supply glut of 2014-2016. I certainly was lending billions to Chesapeake
7401 2018-07-20 22:03:11 Dept. of Law: Ballot Measure 1 would likely impact the development of AK LNG and off-shore oil drilling in the Cook Inlet. #AKLeg #stand4alaska
7402 2018-07-20 22:03:09 More breathtaking hypocrisy from an increasingly irrelevant nationalist politician who yearns for a place on the world stage. We lead the world in climate change yet we need to continue oil extraction to balance the books. It would be funny if it wasn’t so god damned tragic.
7403 2018-07-20 22:03:09 CBD oil mate, or just get high init? Lol..
7404 2018-07-20 22:02:58 This morning 1ltr water, 20oz h20, Coffee 20oz w/ cacao oil
7405 2018-07-20 22:02:53 Most are definitely under NDA, but it’s too real estate investors, Disney, Marvel, top Blockchain organization, top commodity brokers for gold, oil, and diamonds. Things like that.
7406 2018-07-20 22:02:29 Or dipping that fresh  into that olive oil & vinegar 
7407 2018-07-20 22:02:15 yo its good as fuck its vegetables and like a oil tomato sauce idfk but its amazing
7408 2018-07-20 22:02:10 今年は未体験の暑さ。ヤバい。
7409 2018-07-20 22:01:48 And... stop buying oil from them.
7410 2018-07-20 22:01:26 Putin's puppet. Let's take a look. 
700 plus billion defense budget. 
Offensive weapons to Ukraine. 
44 billion increase to NATO.
Calling out Germany for a 55 billion euro deal with Russia for petroleum. 
Selling US oil and gas to Belarus. 
Missile defense back in Poland.
7411 2018-07-20 22:01:21 Just thinking back to Indyref about one of the most bizarre stories which was the discovery of huge oil reserves in SE England, Gatwick Airport area. As big as North Sea. I remember Sky news in particular, interviewing some expert, in detail. Still awaiting the first barrels...
7412 2018-07-20 22:01:05 Gets home from work still covered in oil and grease. Immediately starts working on cosplay. I'm waiting for paint to dry.
7413 2018-07-20 22:00:59 Jill Stein has a lot of her money in Russian oil futures apparently.
7414 2018-07-20 22:00:56 知世ちゃんと尾美としのりは素晴らしいのですがね…
7415 2018-07-20 22:00:49 Too bad they can't be fumigated with skunk oil before they're shipped to America.
7416 2018-07-20 22:00:29 Of the cbd oil??
7417 2018-07-20 22:00:26 Last year a MRI&Mammogram showed a growth starting in my right breast. I had other symptoms as well but after a year of strong cannabis oil my last scan showed no detectable spot on either scan
7418 2018-07-20 22:00:21 Their leader is as big a criminal, as Trump! It’s about power, greed and oil! There’s some very oil rich land they want to steal from Palestine!
7419 2018-07-20 22:00:18 My aunt has tried the gummies & she said they didn’t work. But she’s going to look into the oil & is very excited! I can keep you posted on it 
7420 2018-07-20 22:00:11 Fuck my life today  need new spark plugs in my car and top that off Walmart fucking jipped me last oil change telling me they changed my air filter when they never did and paid for it 
7421 2018-07-20 21:59:42 おしごとぉ
7422 2018-07-20 21:59:41 You don’t believe in the same God as those folks.  Take your snake oil and leave.
7423 2018-07-20 21:59:34 AK Dept. of Law: According to affidavits received by Law, if Ballot Measure 1 (fish habitat initiative) were in effect during the discovery of oil on the North Slope, Prudhoe Bay wouldn’t have been allowed to be developed. #akleg #stand4alaska
7424 2018-07-20 21:59:34 Trying a nicotine e cig cartridge is making me wonder about the magical cannabis oil pens I’ve heard about
7425 2018-07-20 21:59:28 £35 would buy a lot of castor oil and toilet paper.
7426 2018-07-20 21:59:23 Ma'am the thc oil for the knees!
7427 2018-07-20 21:59:08 Oil money gang
7428 2018-07-20 21:58:45 I know real humans that have used cannabis to stimulate their appetites after chemotherapy treatments.  They have used cannabis oil to shrink & dissolve tumors.  Look into cannabis & epilepsy. The plant has real medicinal properties.
7429 2018-07-20 21:58:36 @MattMoscona Didn't get an oil change for 3 years from 2008-2010, didn't know that was a thing... now I know  #F-150 #SomehowStillWorks
7430 2018-07-20 21:58:35 I was just in a situation where I had to  pick between saving my phone or my glass bottle of jojoba oil. I picked the jojoba oil.
7431 2018-07-20 21:58:32 CBD oil tincture tastes like bong water.  I'm not sure why I'm surprised. Hopefully it works better than it tastes!
7432 2018-07-20 21:58:29 I discovered dry oil. I’ll never be the same person again.
7433 2018-07-20 21:58:10 The shale gas thing came up because before we relied on the middle esst to bring us oil now we are energy independent and don't need the rest of the world for oil anymore. Also when your responding make sure you keep it in one thread.
7434 2018-07-20 21:57:39 so, you're saying that a famous scholar and some accountable press are lying. Reading your profile you are: an engineer, an economist, and a press agency... (maybe too much?) The deals I'm talking about is Assad Gov buying oil from IS. And it was well known and documented.
7435 2018-07-20 21:57:32 Wait, is that not how you loose weight?  it’s like “paleo fudge” that is 4,200 calories a bowl cause it’s basically coconut oil with flavor.
7436 2018-07-20 21:57:22 Show is like 3 mini Hannitys who couldn't carry his water, (and I hate Hannity but know he sells the snake oil well to Trumps base).
7437 2018-07-20 21:56:38 @Walmart   Miami Gardens FL, oil change for my car ,manager like Rocio or associates like Leonel that treat customer's time in such disrespecful way; The number of times they have during my 4 hours wait to make things right is INFINITE!  NO apologies ! at the time of check out.
7438 2018-07-20 21:56:32 If you need too spice things up in the bedroom put cinnamon oil in your partners butthole

7440 2018-07-20 21:56:17 -aaa
OK so why did I bring up 'Big Oil' when the cons and friends are talking about liberals and carbon taxes? 
If people pay more for polluting more, and driving and gas is a big part of that pollution, then they will find ways to pollute less
INCLUDING USING LESS GAS
7441 2018-07-20 21:56:05 If pouring half a bottle of olive oil over your pizza is wrong then I don't wanna be right baby
7442 2018-07-20 21:55:52 I wonder how much oil money Putin sends me this week
7443 2018-07-20 21:55:50 الله يسلمك حبيبي 
7444 2018-07-20 21:55:30 O Good God what brimstone fires have we brought upon ourselves & Mother Earth. If the artic is burning we’re gonna be blackened melting marshmallows Congress Senate Trump Charles Koch & all oil fossil fuels Glutton’s  need to legally sign a “snap out of it”  bill across isles
7445 2018-07-20 21:55:18 Even just oil based, drops?
7446 2018-07-20 21:55:09 I'm doing my Harley Quinn (squad) cosplay for the first time tonight, plus oil and glitter show. It's going to be nuts. 
7447 2018-07-20 21:54:13 Rachel have you seen the plan Putin and Trump have to transport Russian oil through Crimea “tax free” could that be the connection we’ve been looking for. Please look. I think there is some thing here.
7448 2018-07-20 21:54:06 I say that's worth an oil rig to the face

But HR works as well
7449 2018-07-20 21:53:59 How do you do this?  what do you do with the oil?  Is it topical?  do you drink it?  What is THC?   Thank you
7450 2018-07-20 21:53:38 how to dispose of old oil & gas infrastructure?

and how to "dispose of" wells?
7451 2018-07-20 21:53:37 the original tweet is basically exactly what I did! for measurements and stuff I would just say follow ur heart  I used olive oil to fry all of the vegetables, starting with the eggplant which I added water to and covered so it would steam. message me if u have more questions
7452 2018-07-20 21:53:37 Sorry oh!! Is it break oil or engine oil? Abi you are talking about red oil 
7453 2018-07-20 21:53:29 me: *showing a coworker pics of a restaurant w raw meat hanging behind a glass window*
coworker 2, who's vegan: that looks good to you?
me: yeah, just think about what it's going to look like
cw1: and how it's going to SMELL. oh yeah, just put some olive oil and garlic on that...
7454 2018-07-20 21:53:10 olive oil flower
7455 2018-07-20 21:53:08 An even better place would be that new microbrewery Halliburton-#Fracking-Oil is buying you & your wife in Whitefish. Oh! The conversations you could have about your latest favorite recreation: Pinning the Tail on the Taxpayer! #FireZinke #BootZinke #HinkyZinke
7456 2018-07-20 21:53:01 Oh man I can’t handle theese kinds of stories. So horrible and tragic.
7457 2018-07-20 21:52:59 Join us for revelry, shitlordery, chicanery, and the occasional debate on the Chaos120 streams. Tonight Scoobie331 hosts on his channel at 10pm eastern. Prepare for peak awesome. Or oil. Whatever we strike first. It should be fun regardless.
7458 2018-07-20 21:52:33 Exactly. Oil cannot be stopped. Will create a crisis.
7459 2018-07-20 21:52:26 This over reliance on Brent crude oil and hiding behind international prices is a decoy to pay for etolls. The #thumamina brigade has outfoxed the masses.all this is a well crafted strategy by these capitalists to get their etolls capital back.where is Sasol to help reduce prices
7460 2018-07-20 21:52:21 Aha. Both contain MCT oil.

Which the guy at disp2 said it might be...

Crossing fingers and toes...
7461 2018-07-20 21:52:20 That's better, but still ...

How about an abandoned oil platform, one over an exhausted field out to sea? There are a few thousand people on St. Helena, and they're of non-European descent, so I'm not so sure about sending them a wave of white supremacists.
7462 2018-07-20 21:52:16 3連はSRのみでした。もう一声って感じ
7463 2018-07-20 21:52:14 You will get all that precious fish oil back! You can finally say "thx for all the fish" and fly back into space!
7464 2018-07-20 21:52:07 sana oil
7465 2018-07-20 21:52:07 Evidence of a tight market. Also puts any worries about China tariffs on oil to rest. If China hits oil there will just be a juggling of supplies. @Orangeman1992
7466 2018-07-20 21:52:07 Chris the oil and there was none!! Idk what’s going on anymore
7467 2018-07-20 21:51:57 They have already ruined it with palm oil!!
7468 2018-07-20 21:51:37 @newyorklivetv @LaurenScala4NY #sullivanstreetbakery I love bread. I could live on it  These breads are awesome. Great menu items. Olive oil brownie? yum! @jacquereid @sara_gore
7469 2018-07-20 21:51:14 I can report that all coconut oil in this household has solidified again.
7470 2018-07-20 21:51:12 What are those good things? Tax cuts?  That won't last long with oil prices rising, interest rates rising etc. Immigration, foriegn policy, health care = disaster.  Oh wait there is the stock market and economy = Obama's coat tails and when it goes down it will be Obama's fault.
7471 2018-07-20 21:51:04 It may be in some aspects correct, by olive oil production in Alaska made me laugh. 
7472 2018-07-20 21:50:46 Water & Oil don't mix.
7473 2018-07-20 21:50:43 If we assume that you recognize that climate change is real and that action is required to reduce greenhouse emissions, what do you propose we as a nation should do to reduce emissions? Oh that's right...You are in bed with big oil. But even big oil knows that action is needed 
7474 2018-07-20 21:50:42 Yes ma’am put a little holy oil on the boxxx Jesus Christ will never do u wrong
7475 2018-07-20 21:50:36 Out of everything that my clumsy ass could do i spill coconut oil on my Calvin Klein bra 
7476 2018-07-20 21:50:28 I put on it a lot of oil Shatta
7477 2018-07-20 21:50:26 Because he has fun rubbing baby oil on himself
7478 2018-07-20 21:50:03 @Walmart   Miami Gardens FL, oil change for my car ,manager like Rocio or associates like Leonel that treat customer's time in such disrespecful way; The number of times they have during my 4 hours wait to make things right is INFINITE!

7481 2018-07-20 21:49:36 We have the Perten IM 9500.  But we bought it to do protein and oil on IP soys.  It is expensive, but he tech is state of the art.
7482 2018-07-20 21:49:15 Yeah smoking isn't legal yet (???) But vaping is. Didn't have this problem with vaping. But OMG I nearly coughed up a lung so yuck.

I inhaled years ago ahem. Just a little, but didn't have this problem. Oof.

Trying to find out what oil #1 uses...tbc 
7483 2018-07-20 21:49:13 A traffic cone, a stapler, a bar of soap, a bottle of olive oil, a mullet, a popsicle, a block of ice, an ATM, or maybe a nurse I could go all day
7484 2018-07-20 21:48:44 Sweaty LITHOGRAPHS are called that because they’re OIL PAINTINGS I don’t think that’d be a good idea
7485 2018-07-20 21:48:39 good art day today.. lotta oil, lotta lead, lotta pics
7486 2018-07-20 21:48:34 So far for my birthday, I’ve: gotten and oil change, got my nails done, ate lunch with my parents and now car wash for my baby. Productive and having a great ass day 
7487 2018-07-20 21:48:19 America arms and trains dictators and then when they try to trade oil in anything other than the petro dollar America destroys them
7488 2018-07-20 21:48:10 For developing economies that rely on exports having a weak currency is good otherwise US will not buy from you since u have become expensive. Though it should come to a lesser value with time. And btw if you use avg 30 ltr oil p.m 4-500 rs extra for a hard working PM. Bear it.
7489 2018-07-20 21:48:07 I hate watching the news in America. It's literally all just sensationalist bullshit. CANNABIS OIL IN MAKEUP. Okay? Why is that a story. You haven't even told us why this is a bad thing.
7490 2018-07-20 21:47:59 Cannabis oil
7491 2018-07-20 21:47:42 #どやミ の思い出に浸っている
7492 2018-07-20 21:47:36 Those oil heaters are good too, I would be worried leaving an electric heater on all night, it doesn’t worry you ?
7493 2018-07-20 21:47:17 Emissions are distributed across age groups of gas-and-oil- and coal-fired in rough proportion to operating capacity, like CO2 emissions. d panel shows the emissions, not the emission intensity.
7494 2018-07-20 21:47:03 Who’s your “oil” brother ??
7495 2018-07-20 21:47:03 And now we find sharks and whales washed up on beaches nearly everyday with stomachs packed with plastic waste? America wants to shoot bears while they hibernate and they want to eradicate wolves. Oil obsession will finally kill off ALL life in the seas and deserts are expanding!
7496 2018-07-20 21:46:48 Still, snake oil.
7497 2018-07-20 21:46:41 Lol sorry. There’s a solution tho. Use bio oil on wet skin and let it dry naturally before applying your daily body cream. Worked for me and I haven’t stopped using it till date. Keyword: wet skin.
7498 2018-07-20 21:46:34 Oil hands no deck
7499 2018-07-20 21:46:18 When an oil change wont keep it running
7500 2018-07-20 21:45:46 Blend 4 1/2 tbsps Black Beans with 9 tsps Squid . Mix into  Olive Oil. Freeze for 9 hours. Serve with salmon
7501 2018-07-20 21:45:46 Coconut oil in the sunlight will bake yo skin
7502 2018-07-20 21:45:45 Coco oil is mah homie too 
7503 2018-07-20 21:45:43 Check your Transmission oil this morning.
7504 2018-07-20 21:45:41 You are digging under a wrong tree. Putin never looted his country, but jailed many oligarchs. Your source is a la lying, bitter individual. Putin has a few friends, one of them was a late Total oil mogul, Christophe de Margerie. Putin never betrays friends. Assad asked 4 help.
7505 2018-07-20 21:45:24 That could mean a number of things but it’s not your oil. Probably need an alignment or your bearings are bad
7506 2018-07-20 21:45:20 Hella excited cuz i just got a new bottle of jojoba oil and this toner that has witch hazel infused with aloe vera and rose water 
7507 2018-07-20 21:45:11 Always nice to have tap water catch fire, so some jerk can get some crummy grade of oil.
7508 2018-07-20 21:45:07 Ahh, a quick google search reveals that it’s just that the European stuff is ‘sustainable palm oil’... taste is probably the same (orangutan tears don’t have much flavour?)
7509 2018-07-20 21:45:05 I don't think it's rude if I ask you to not have "half a bottle of oil" in your hair before your haircut. You wouldn't like it, if I asked you to see how much I've been sweating throughout the day at work would you? (!)  
7510 2018-07-20 21:44:58 They are in many countries just not in those where big oil is so profitable do a web search and actually read up on them instead of swallowing a company line I'll even admit they are not perfect or perfected yet but still better than the toxic mess we are headed for!
7511 2018-07-20 21:44:46 That’s what happens when you get hold of oil money man but you might wake up to news of Willian being a Barca player...
7512 2018-07-20 21:44:43 voa tratar eso a ver... tea tree oil hasn’t been cutting it lately. también i gotta get over the fact that i have big a$$ pores. tengo que aceptar mi realidad jajaja
7513 2018-07-20 21:44:36 すごくわかります。話し合いできるならこんなとこで吐き出してねえわって毎回思いますし、わざわざラインとかで長々 話し合うべきだよ！ って言って来るやつはうんこです。
7514 2018-07-20 21:44:17 You the machine bori would use tomorrow morning collect anointing oil
7515 2018-07-20 21:44:15 If the oil is clear, it does not need to be changed. The second place is definitely suspect. Did you tell them the work had just been done?

7517 2018-07-20 21:43:57 That evolution did not require the billions of dollars in subsidies that are now expected to keep your supposed green energy junk working, along with all this terrible oil(235 litres) to keep them from seizing up.

7519 2018-07-20 21:43:35 My dad said an oil change shouldn’t take any longer than 30 minutes  I took it in and now I’m stranded for an hour and a half 
7520 2018-07-20 21:43:34 Imagine that
 a radiant redheaded Finnish ESTJ oil heiress,
 waving long and lustrous hair off her face while pulling on a chocolate brown suede sweater,
 knowingly feeds a handful of buffalo weed to a
 visibly shaking Irish Sport Horse.
7521 2018-07-20 21:43:16 Remember how in wizard of oz the tin man kept rusting and they had to oil him constantly?

@CocaCola should do a parody ad where they just make him drink coke every time.

Think about guys
7522 2018-07-20 21:43:13 Good thing my mechanic just replaced my brakes and told me he won't see me again until I need an oil change.
7523 2018-07-20 21:43:09 The pallet of olive oil delivered to the farm turned out to be a pallet of pregnancy tests?? Who mixed these up??? Does someone out there think they are the same!??!
7524 2018-07-20 21:43:06 i just found a plant used in oil production with a very unfortunate name.... like this if you know
7525 2018-07-20 21:43:06 Seems to have issues with typos as well... Baaaaahaaaaahaaaa... pretty sure it’s supposed to read ‘treating yourself ‘... if not, you’re right... drunk
7526 2018-07-20 21:42:55 The premise hasn’t changed, unless you mean our economy is rock bottom & oil revenue zero?
7527 2018-07-20 21:42:46 I’m getting my oil changed so I’m waiting inside a lil waiting room with maybe 6 other people. I watched this video of a boy getting a dog and when he cried I started crying. I still have to sit here and wait with these people that looked over to see me casually crying.
7528 2018-07-20 21:42:40 I did actually read the whole thread and you seemed like a twat the whole way down. Batteries do not explode the way oil does. They smoke, pop, and catch fire. A battery explosion is containable and extremely preventable, and in no fucking way justifies not using them.
7529 2018-07-20 21:42:38 do u know how fucking stupid u look talking about banning plastic straws while holding a plastic drink????????? 

I don’t have time for this nonsense. Take on big oil or don’t talk to me Karen.

7533 2018-07-20 21:42:02 Thank you for sharing this story and all the work you do @LFFriedman! We agree — stomach-turning to watch. But @rose_strauss is made of stern stuff & she’s continuing the fight! Keep an eye on @sunrisemvmt as we turn up the  on those who take oil $ gas $$ this election season
7534 2018-07-20 21:41:53 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
7535 2018-07-20 21:41:52 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
7536 2018-07-20 21:41:50 @nailogical I made an oops when I ordered my vitamin e for my cuticle oil and instead of getting gel I got oil. Would it still work in the cuticle oil mixture or would it be way too runny?

We have taken over every piece of land and driven animals to the very fringes. We pollute the seas with oil spillages, pour all our sewage into it....
7540 2018-07-20 21:41:41 That's nice but... where's my olive oil?
7541 2018-07-20 21:40:47 Europe gets the palm oil free stuff I think, but they leave it in for NZ

7543 2018-07-20 21:40:35 I need my oil changed
7544 2018-07-20 21:40:22 It's the healing process, the skin is dry and tight, which causes itchiness. I suggest putting like vitamin e oil, almond oil or coconut oil on it nightly
7545 2018-07-20 21:40:13 @gmbutts Start charging tariffs on Saudi oil that's imported into Canada.... huge tariffs! Isn't that the same thing? You think Canadians don't see through your manipulations!
7546 2018-07-20 21:39:52 Fuds first.  Oil Change can wait, months if need be, going by my experience.

7549 2018-07-20 21:39:35 @BrooklynSpoke Big Oil must be held accountable for the oil that is in his limo to get him to the gym.  We have a mayor in my town who actually gave up his VIP parking slot because he rides his bike every day.  Yes, it's a small town but just sayin'.  And he's a tea partier.

LOL I'm not taking advice from a snake oil salesman. Thanks!
7551 2018-07-20 21:38:38 oil on my timeline; Let's keep up these looking:
7552 2018-07-20 21:38:37 Like I said, you're not really aware of what people are saying if your original statements stand on their own. You've conflated 2 issues & the fact no one expects oil to be instantly vaporized from society. Hence the term "evolve". 

Think horse & buggy to car transition style.
7553 2018-07-20 21:38:30 They never received huge amounts of aid from the US government like SK did. For most of the 20th century, VZ's oil wealth was looted by foreign corporations who got very rich, rather than the Venezuelan people or country.

The wiki page I posted earlier is well worth reading.
7554 2018-07-20 21:38:29 They are negating the risk. Pipelines are the safest way to transport oil. That's the whole point. You can move more oil at a lower cost and in the safest way. You need money to spend it. People will be buying oil anyway, why not ours
7555 2018-07-20 21:38:29 8-Follower, CON messaging Troll!
Harper left crumbling Infrastructure, lousy Oil dependant Economy & extra $160B on Nat Debt. As well as seriously underfunded programs frm which he clawed back $$ to pretend a Surplus- $1.1B frm Vets alone. THAT necessitates spending.
7556 2018-07-20 21:38:22 It's times like these when you realize that the Flinstones are dead and we're putting their bones in our cars for oil.
7557 2018-07-20 21:38:04 Start a smoothie with kefir. Throw in blueberries, beet greens and coconut cream. Add fish oil if it feels right. Blend.
7558 2018-07-20 21:38:04 2. CO2 emissions are distributed across age groups of gas-and-oil- and coal-fired in rough proportion to operating capacity because of a lack of deployed carbon capture and storage systems on operating fossil-fuel power plants in 2010.
7559 2018-07-20 21:38:01 Whenever I’m going over like 50/60mph then start to break my car shakes. Do I need oil or something?
7560 2018-07-20 21:38:01 It's an oil painting any idea where it's from

7563 2018-07-20 21:37:24 No it was actually the previous liberal government banking policies that saved us which Harper had voted before becoming pm to remove. And the only other reason is was oil so high and profitable for us. Harper did squat
7564 2018-07-20 21:37:23 Hahaha yesss ok cool. I washed all my sheets in peppermint oil too and sprayed the shit out of my room 
7565 2018-07-20 21:37:19 What’s the name of that place in LA where you can make your essential oil perfume? I can’t think of the name and can’t find it on google. Or did I just make something up? Lol
7566 2018-07-20 21:37:09 Trump will end up working well with Russia, but for now he will be tough on them.  Remember his stance at NATO against the Russian oil to Germany and the pipe line that is a real hit.
7567 2018-07-20 21:36:56 You may have a sinus infection. Get someone to go to Whole Foods and get Oil of Oregano capsules. Take 2 three times a day for one day, then 1 three times a day after that. It should clear up in 3 to 4 days. Also try homeopathic nasal spray. I hope you get better soon!
7568 2018-07-20 21:36:38 I stopped putting lotion on Bc of summer and started using coconut oil & it’s one of the best decisions I’ve made this year

7570 2018-07-20 21:36:17 So you would have a family on low income pay for medication.  Or make a choice , heat, feed or meds. What kind of society is that for a person to live in? Especially a wealthy oil rich country

7572 2018-07-20 21:36:05 The president's frequent extravagant medical trips is the drain on the counties resources. His oil subsidies that have suddenly increased due to the fraudulent increase in volume of fuel consumption from 35m litres to 65m litres is a another drain in the countries resources.
7573 2018-07-20 21:36:02 The best way to describe acid is the more you take the more the world looks like a moving oil painting.
7574 2018-07-20 21:35:59 Decided to pamper the luminati today and got the oil changed.. ended up getting asked by the girl working if i would take her for a spin in my “really nice car” WHUT

7577 2018-07-20 21:35:45 I'm all 4 my mum getting hyped about using coconut oil as a moisturiser like yes mamma let me feel ur soft forehead
7578 2018-07-20 21:35:32 I like them baked in the oven with olive oil, extra garlic , and salt. Maybe a sprinkle of parmesan cheese
7579 2018-07-20 21:35:30 Everybody and they’re mom will try to get an oil change tomorrow morning

We discovered a planet with an amaranth ocean.
When analysed the water was highly contaminated by some crude oil.
The world is mostly in ruins.
Some large structures still standing.
One of the elders said it was "the original Earth".

7582 2018-07-20 21:35:15 Well oil isn’t going to run out anytime soon, and is a renewable resource. Your solar and wind crap can’t make it on their own, so are really just a huge waste of feel good money.
7583 2018-07-20 21:35:12 Funnily enough, it’s now 3:30 and I only just got done replacing the wheel bearing and (hopefully) fixing the oil leak.

Part of what took so long is that I broke 2 (!) sockets and wasted a lot of time looking for (then giving up and having to buy) replacements.
7584 2018-07-20 21:35:12 RT @LivingSafely: Cheeze-It this July? Its top three ingredients are flour, soybean and palm oil with tert-Butylhydroquinone.

7586 2018-07-20 21:34:57 I worked at 6am, when I got off I got my oil changed, went to the bank and soeted some things out, came home and did my laundry. I’m feeling rather adulty today (:

7589 2018-07-20 21:34:15 If you're into meditation (that is, when you sit & close eyes thoughts don't flood the mind), try Frankincense essential oil 
But not too much or you'll find out why ;)

7591 2018-07-20 21:34:11 My husband came home from a LARP, telling me about his beard bonding with the other Vikings over what oil to use. 
He is very happy someone convinced him to try it.
7592 2018-07-20 21:34:00 the oil or the powder??? because both Suck but the powder is Big Death
7593 2018-07-20 21:33:54 I agree with your criticism of the very purist US conception of libertarianism that MR represents. The same surreal nonsense is often heard wrt perfectly functioning markets with no regulation. It's naive. One disagreement: the industrial revolution was the result of finding oil
7594 2018-07-20 21:33:45 Okay, do I go get my oil changed then go home and order pizza or do I stop and get take out then get the oil change done after breakfast with my sister? I have spoons left for one task this afternoon.
7595 2018-07-20 21:33:41 I don't actually *like* pizza, and flour makes me ill, but a party is a party.  A bloke has to suffer sometimes in the interests of celebration.  I used 150g strong white bread flour, 150g plain flour, a glug of olive oil, a knob of butter, half tsp salt and half tsp yeast

7598 2018-07-20 21:33:24 Let's face it, the world needs oil, I guess we just forgot to clean up after ourselves.
7599 2018-07-20 21:33:12 I can’t do a single oil change without looking for a filter wrench for 40 minutes every time.
7600 2018-07-20 21:33:04 If you’re patient, your oil change is free.
7601 2018-07-20 21:33:01 Oil free eye makeup remover is the BEST!

7604 2018-07-20 21:32:12 Unlike other types of vegetable oils, the extra virgin variety of olive oil does not undergo high-temperature processing that can create free radicals, dangerous chemicals that can attack cells and damage tissue. Instead, it is made by crushing olives between stone or steel.
7605 2018-07-20 21:32:06 @DanicaPatrick NFL, thee MLB, thee NHL, etc. I spelled out ‘thee’ 4 clarity. Of course, ‘the’ doesn’t change its spelling, only its pron. Rule prevents glottal stops & make spoken Eng. flow more smoothly. Say, ‘thuh oil spill in thuh ocean is polluting thuh air.’ Now say w/thee.

7607 2018-07-20 21:31:45 Did THE WORST tonight, decided to slice an Orange and put in in my Rooibos tea, thinking there'd be a burst of flavor. HUGE MISTAKE!
It tasted like I had drank Castor Oil , Black tea and had an Orange. 
NEVER AGAIN!!! 
I'll stick to lemon slices Thank You!
7608 2018-07-20 21:31:40 It makes my skin really tight as well. I use it in combination with an oil. I use bio oil because it helps with my acne scars and my dry skin.
7609 2018-07-20 21:31:35 Not exactly circle of life more like clumsy idiot but I pulled my very heavy cooker out to rescue a ladybird that went down the back, took it outside and dropped it straight into a can of old engine oil 
7610 2018-07-20 21:31:27 I’ve never tired the oil so my results could be very different but in general it’s helpful for me.
7611 2018-07-20 21:31:13 Just drenched my hair in coconut oil hoping it reverses about 4 years worth of damage

7624 2018-07-20 21:29:11 Adulting- spending a Friday afternoon taking care of an oil change, car inspection, and registration renewal.
7625 2018-07-20 21:29:08 I hate my life. The next few days will be rough for me.

7627 2018-07-20 21:28:59 So if nine members of Trumps administration vote to sell anther 20% of our uranium reserves or 20% of our strategic oil reserves to Putin then there's nothing Trump can do about it and we just have to accept it. That sounds crazy, but I guess thats how things work in Washington.

7636 2018-07-20 21:27:27 Nuclear power seems to be a partial answer for developed nations's energy needs, which will have to replace fossil fuels as they are depleted. However, poor nations will suffer first because they won't be able to afford $150 oil.

7641 2018-07-20 21:27:06 Speaking as a chronic pain patient, I'm all for a persons right to pain relief but smoking is their preference. They can still use edible or oil for pain relief.
7642 2018-07-20 21:26:47 I've done it. One experiment I did like was a balsamic vinegar/olive oil and herbs.
7643 2018-07-20 21:26:33 All vegetable oils and seed oils are toxic, ie grape seed oil, canola oil, vegetable oil. They we originally made to lubricate machines not humans.
7644 2018-07-20 21:26:23 Just make sure that you get it from authentic hipster beards; there's lots of knockoffs and sometimes they try to pass off beatnik or hippy beard oil as the real thing
7645 2018-07-20 21:26:20 Y’all got to stop putting Vaseline and babyoil in y’all kids hair. It doesn’t moisturize it, it literally just sits on top of the hair. Use jojoba oil, Castro oil,olive oil, or Moroccan oil
7646 2018-07-20 21:26:05 I got some extra snake oil to sell you if you’re interested.
7647 2018-07-20 21:25:58 Oh right, I'm like three months overdue for an oil change. Thanks for the reminder!
7648 2018-07-20 21:25:31 I HATE IT my mom put oil in my hair and that yellow powder thing all over my body oof
7649 2018-07-20 21:25:18 I just want this oil change so I can go get some food
7650 2018-07-20 21:25:18 WHATS THE MOVE IN CANADA
7651 2018-07-20 21:25:17 What does a oil change cost these days? I can’t remember ever paying for a oil & filter change. Imo part of having drivers license should be knowing how to change oil because it’s so easy a 10 year kid could do it.
7652 2018-07-20 21:25:00 I broke down and bought hipster beard oil and I have to say it's pretty nice
7653 2018-07-20 21:24:42 article) he would have talked about oil stained jeans, a confederate flag, and a NASCAR hat. His defense of it is patently ridiculous. I agree that the way you look and dress matters. It's the reason that I show up to work in slacks and button up shirts instead of my sweaty gym2/
7654 2018-07-20 21:24:37 If anyone is looking into new birth control and wants something they probably won't worry about I highly recommend Xulane cuz I spent 2 days straight jumping off a boat, swimming in a lake, having tanning oil slathered all over my arm, and the patch stayed on somehow lmao

7656 2018-07-20 21:24:21 It worked!  Fixed my noisy, revving power supply fan with a syringe, some wire insulation (hose), and sewing machine oil. Totally psyched that it worked. 
7657 2018-07-20 21:24:19 Snake oil worked on this guy.
7658 2018-07-20 21:24:18 I LITERALLY ASK FOR THAT IT FEELS SO GOOD  except the oil can .,, i just get a head massage. pls
7659 2018-07-20 21:23:57 i grabbed something out of the dryer before the cycle finished and the hot air billowing out just CAKED my face in oil. eugh
7660 2018-07-20 21:23:56 I like my girl just like olive oil: extra virgin.
7661 2018-07-20 21:23:47 I don’t really care about clean energy . You can use oil and gas at night .

7676 2018-07-20 21:21:44 Have you tried CBD oil?its not research they are using it a medication now
7677 2018-07-20 21:21:39 you haven’t rubbed oil in my hair thus far so YES amazing
7678 2018-07-20 21:21:36 ikr but it still works. olive oil works better too.
7679 2018-07-20 21:21:35 In that oil is lost caffeine, lost flavor.  Oils also prove beans to be stale.  Stale beans (more than 24 days past roast date) also release oil without being black. To be oily at 24 days would be rare, more like 60-90 or something. But it would not be fresh / smooth.
7680 2018-07-20 21:21:33 That’s the problem in this unequal Union, the bigger country thinks everyone else’s stuff is theirs by divine right, then bigger country tells the others they are subsidising them. For decades Scotland’s oil has kept the UK from going bankrupt & Welsh water keeps them afloat.
7681 2018-07-20 21:21:11 My fav thing about getting oil changes is that almost all the magazines are targeted to women- 
Family circle, Vogue, Elle

Bc the stereotype is only women get oil changes. But I’ve never seen another woman in here. It’s ALWAYS men, and most look blue collar af 
7682 2018-07-20 21:20:59 It’s only the fake believers that think that way.  If you truly believe the world has no use for oil, than get rid of whatever device you use to   post messages on.  Walk the walk, just don’t expect everyone else to walk it with you, cause, obviously, we are not as dumb.
7683 2018-07-20 21:20:56 I’m still having a very bad reaction to the cbd oil and not feeling well. I have to keep taking Benadryl until the reaction subsides. I’ll try to help everyone attending #reptourEastRutherford, but the medicine makes me very tired. Miss you so much @taylorswift13 @taylornation13

7690 2018-07-20 21:19:19 YUP. They had a large plastic bucket with a garbage bag on empty containers (which those were filled with hazardous stuff) but they said one on the bottom was leaking oil. It wasn’t. Literally dog shit and rain water. I’ve never smelled something so putrid
7691 2018-07-20 21:18:59 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
7692 2018-07-20 21:18:49 The moment u find ur twin, this is EPIC. And coconut oil??? I just can't....
7693 2018-07-20 21:18:40 Most American chocolate is fat, sugar, and a ton of vegetable oil.  It’s pretty gross.
7694 2018-07-20 21:18:37 Much like Venezuela which is rich in oil
7695 2018-07-20 21:18:35 oh no sweetie you really need to start using an OIL based face wash!!
7696 2018-07-20 21:18:29 That is what I do actually lol. I add coconut oil, cayenne pepper and turmeric and it’s barely drinkable. Looking to improve on that delightful concoction.
7697 2018-07-20 21:18:12 I agree, he was daddy's second and third term though really... Daddy wanted to get back at Saddam for blowing up his oil fields in Kuwait!
7698 2018-07-20 21:18:07 I honestly have been surprised by the size of the spread.  thought a commodity market would adjust a bit more easily (US selling oil seeds to europe, european oil seed supply moving to China, etc)

7701 2018-07-20 21:17:34 Like the pipeline proponents who only listen to oil co sales pitches? Or the ones who completely ignore the entire world speaking about the critical need to evolve from these energies now?

7703 2018-07-20 21:17:16 What can he say?  He's a snake oil salesmen!  He's bounced money around so long, they'll bury him under Moscow!
7704 2018-07-20 21:17:15 Aegean oil or moroccan oil is good at keeping your hair frizz free, I deep condition my hair before I straighten it so it’ll stay nice and silky

7709 2018-07-20 21:16:33 I hate when I go get my oil changed because when they come back telling me what all needs to be done with my car I never know wth they’re talking about 
7710 2018-07-20 21:16:31 I don`t know anyone who eats that stuff on its own. It`s always pimped, even if it`s just with salt, oil and garlic or something like that.
Yes, it`s tasteless.

7712 2018-07-20 21:16:23 The same reason you wear at least an apron while cooking. Just while there's the risk of hot oil or something popping onto you, ironing runs a small risk of getting steam burns.
7713 2018-07-20 21:16:13 So I slowly cut my dosage in half and started using cbd oil for the pain. Then hemptations gave me a sample of kratom. And now using both with zero side effects

7716 2018-07-20 21:15:56 why are artists out here arguing on which art form is harder? writing is very hard and complex. coming up with prompts and developing characters and plot is extremely difficult but so is doing an entire piece in oil paints or spending hours perfecting a digital piece
7717 2018-07-20 21:15:34 #RT @SexAdviceBot: For aftercare, try using a massage oil
7718 2018-07-20 21:15:28 I tried to treat myself to some oil paints, canvases & wood panels but I wasn’t at my usual art store I felt like I was cheating I couldn’t do it, plus they were rude. But I did buy a cute new sketchbook & pens so expect some cute shit coming soooon
7719 2018-07-20 21:15:10 Inte riktigt sant. ”This systematic review did find moderate evidence that ALA, found in plant oils (such as rapeseed or canola oil) and nuts (particularly walnuts) may be slightly protective of some diseases of the heart and circulation. However, the effect is very small”.
7720 2018-07-20 21:15:08 Mmm not when they’re sautéed in garlic and olive oil
7721 2018-07-20 21:15:07 Energy wise, 1 barrel of oil is roughly equivalent of 11 years of human labor: so now you can directly equate those 24 hours in terms of earnings to terms of energy.  The wealthy have access to eons of "days" while the poor may not even be able to afford more than their own labor
7722 2018-07-20 21:14:53 For aftercare, try using a massage oil

7727 2018-07-20 21:14:09 Lol my dad taught me how to do an oil change but didn't teach me how to change a tire. :))))

Oil changed.

Bendito sea Dios.
7729 2018-07-20 21:14:00 If you bought a new car, and start running it for 10 years without a single oil change, filter and other maintaince and ignoring warning signs. Then atlast it will stop moving and will be scrap. That's what pur politician did with our Pakistan.

Politician only made money.

7732 2018-07-20 21:13:37 I dk why my skin is so reactive lately. I had to swap out products that I've used for months bc they started to sting so bad. Maybe it's the tea tree oil I used or maybe my skin needs to make up her mind lol

7736 2018-07-20 21:13:13 Wow
7737 2018-07-20 21:12:45 Argan oil is actually a blessing 
7738 2018-07-20 21:12:23 No, we are discussing vegetable oil not vegetables.
7739 2018-07-20 21:12:09 Self sufficiency in oil/gas avoids dependency on others to sustain security and prosperity. If you are dependent upon others there is obligation to dance to their tune. Why does our Labour/NZF Govt want to undermine the secure and prosperous future of its own people. Globalists.
7740 2018-07-20 21:12:04 Boil water, pour it into a large mixing bowl. Add 4-5 drops of tea tree oil and 6-7 drops of eucalyptus oil. Steam your face with a towel over your head for about 10-15 minutes. Should relieve your symptoms in a few hours. Feel better!

7745 2018-07-20 21:11:35 Took the jeep in for an oil change and tire rotation because it’s hot af out and I don’t want to do it. Plus there’s a brewery right next to the shop
7746 2018-07-20 21:11:27 Awesome!  I’ve been fascinated by lightning storms my whole life.  Once climbed the Derrick on an oil rig during a lightning storm (I was young and dumb).
7747 2018-07-20 21:11:22 She needs us far more than we need her. She has to be desperate if she's buying oil from Russia.  Meanwhile, we are on pace to become the #1 oil producer in the world and our cost to produce it is decreasing at the same time. #Winning

7751 2018-07-20 21:11:10 Airlines aren't charities.  They're for-profit businesses.  Just like @ChickfilA.

And, just like @ChickfilA, when the cost of doing business goes up, prices will go up.  Fuel prices alone are driving increases right now.  Oil prices are up significantly over last year.
7752 2018-07-20 21:11:08 Actually import of luxuries is less than 2% the oil and gas cannot be immediately stopped. Main thing is to increase export and reduce corruption circular debt in energy, use claen energy such as dams and less reliance in hydrocarbons

7761 2018-07-20 21:09:00 Big oil just wants to continue with business as usual. As long as we allow politicians to accept monitary gifts from corporations, this will keep happening.

definitely spent several grand overall  on weed by this point tho no question
7771 2018-07-20 21:07:50 Would love to see a video going in-depth about facial oils and which ones are good for which skin type, I've been wanting to add that to my routine but I'm nervous about picking the wrong oil because my skin is *extremely* sensitive
7772 2018-07-20 21:07:49 So I noticed my hair was thinning (probs from when i had a poor diet and having to wear my hair in a ponytail for work every day) & started taking B12  & fish oil. I think it’s working. Maybe I’m too optimistic
7773 2018-07-20 21:07:40 Enjoy your oil. 
7774 2018-07-20 21:07:35 Guys... no matter how healthy it is, no matter how many benefits it has to your immune system, don't drink ANYTHING that has oil of oregano in it. I had a power shot 2 hrs ago and every time I burp I taste the grease trap from a 2-star bodega Italian restaurant.

7781 2018-07-20 21:07:12 Two personal investments you can learn from. Bottom of oil doesn’t mean the company won’t go bankrupt. Just because the bank gave them a billion dollars doesn’t mean they won’t file bankruptcy. All ceos paid in full, reorganized quickly back in business all stock and debt erased.
7782 2018-07-20 21:07:04 Ophir crazy value at 45p a share, with oil at 70$ ..standard life increases holding today...watch this space.

7785 2018-07-20 21:06:38 Lyle Rossiter, whose expert testimony is repeatedly tossed out of court cases? He’s selling snake oil and outdated thoughts about left brain/right brain psychology.     But, yes, some rumors are out there.  But much is confirmed by all branches of IC community.  We need answers
7786 2018-07-20 21:06:37 If i go and get the erroneous shipment, i can already tell you what will happen. if the products are in saleable condition i will want to pay you for them IF i can sell them, mannose and hemp oil guaranteed sales there, not sure about the rest, could be a bunch of one-offs.

7789 2018-07-20 21:06:22 Russia continues to supply oil ship-to-ship and China is moving supplies on a regular basis.  Nothing has changed since 1954, except N. Korea now has a nuclear arsenal.

For instance, most synthetic drugs come from the 1% of a barrel of oil that is worth way more than all the rest of it already 

Ie after the peak oil, we may have a reprieve, and still have a little oil left that was too hard to extract at first
7791 2018-07-20 21:06:16 Just made a mushroom chicken stir fry with zucchini onions and cabbage and made my own sauce with wasabi ginger and sesame oil. Topped with sesame seeds. My own creation of madness.

7794 2018-07-20 21:05:59 I honestly do not believe cars require oil. It's just another example of Big Automotive trying to nickel & dime us out of more money.

7806 2018-07-20 21:04:16 Ur absolutely right. Drastic measures needed to cut imports of luxuries, and excelerate export promotion policies. Complete stoppage of gas/furnace oil electricity production and switching to coal...plus lifeline from china, rather than going to the IMF
7807 2018-07-20 21:04:14 Paying bills, oil change and school shopping.. spending money is exhausting
7808 2018-07-20 21:04:08 Two theater veterans told me yesterday during my first experience as a movie *extra* that I have a look. The one who taught my comedy improv class offered this: "Yes, you do have A Look. It's kind of Oil of Olay." He doesn't know me well enough to know that I actually use that...
7809 2018-07-20 21:03:44 What was the price of crude oil in the  international market? It was over a $100 per barrel. Nigeria’s income then is incomparable to what we have now. Yet, Bihari has the highest spending on infrastructure in a single term than any president.
7810 2018-07-20 21:03:42 BRB, I’m changing the oil on my model 3.  Ok done.
7811 2018-07-20 21:03:38 Russia is still an empire in all but name today. The eastern 'federal republics' would be wealthy oil states today, but all the money goes to Moscow and St Petersburg.
7812 2018-07-20 21:03:31 Where is the data which says that didn't happen? £ is on the floor, austerity means no pay rises, food costs up, oil price up. Companies leaving, jobs going. It's happening.
7813 2018-07-20 21:03:16 Putin chose Tillerson, he was a great friend to Russia when he worked at Exxon during which tillerson drew up a plan to drill for oil in Siberia ice fields...Putin is interested in continuing that so he needs sanctions gone
7814 2018-07-20 21:03:00 I fucking love that my oil change only costs me $41
7815 2018-07-20 21:02:56 I just went to Walmart to get my oil changed in my car.

7843 2018-07-20 20:57:41 While resolutely and supremely flawed on many levels, including societal hypocrisy that astounds today, willful ignorance & lack of care for humanity by those purporting to be in command of erstwhile "mankind." 
they need their Einsteins and their oil magnates to get to payday
7844 2018-07-20 20:57:39 Coconut oil good for your health is a marketing argument of the coconut industry. In reality it's 90% of saturated fats and has a negative  impact on cholesterol. Use moderately.

7850 2018-07-20 20:57:01 A responsible government would diversify its revenue, invest in import substitution, put money in foreign companies that are doing very well. Look at Russia and Saudi Arabia, they both did very well in dealing with the oil crisis, and are now back to pretty good growth!

7855 2018-07-20 20:56:23 American dependence on imported oil made Saudi Arabia & Kuwait rich.  American preference for electronics made South Korea & China prosperous, Contrast with Russia our long term enemy, their economy is as disaster.

• Terror attacks on home soil increase 
• Blame *insert Arab nation w/ oil pipeline here* 
• Blast Corbyn for requesting evidence 
• Bomb said nation w/ consent

7897 2018-07-20 20:50:54 To add to this, the value of oil was around $30 per barrel in 2016, so Venezuela would have needed to spend $27.62 per barrel in extraction costs to make $2.38 profit.
7898 2018-07-20 20:50:48 They didn’t have a dynamic economy like the US has

Venezuela was only dependent on oil so when oil prices dropped their economy failed

7913 2018-07-20 20:49:29 @brandless needs to make an essentials oil for a burner or something with the lemon verbena scent they have in the soap, or a fabric spray to freshen up a room.
Still waiting on that soy or fair-trade candle, too.
7914 2018-07-20 20:49:20 Say they traveling through an oil field and that's why the bases are black ;D
7915 2018-07-20 20:49:14 All true. The example used is nearly double min wage. I doubt $20 a week will be life changing for her. Even $15 an hr will not afford a $70,000 lifestyle, the perception Bernie creates by promoting idea this will afford enough food, healthcare, housing......
7916 2018-07-20 20:49:08 US is 13 oil exports $21.8 billion 2.6% of world
You are including imports processed at refineries but not used by us

Laws that stopped export of oil or LPG removed We can supply Europe
RPipeline is natural gas. We are exporting LPG.

Rus cuts off energy to get what they want

7924 2018-07-20 20:48:10 Tame your headaches by rubbing peppermint oil like tiger balm to the temples.
7925 2018-07-20 20:48:07 I hate taking my car for an oil change. They always seem to find something else that needs to be fixed, and I don't know enough about cars to know if they're making stuff up.

"My transmission piston oil needs to be flushed? Hmm... haven't had that done in a few years..."

7930 2018-07-20 20:47:36 Take a tonic of fresh grated ginger root, honey, and hot water as a tea at least 3 times daily. 

Also, fill a sink with hot water and 3-5 drops of eucalyptus essential oil. Drape a towel over your head and breathe in the steam for about 5 minutes!!

7938 2018-07-20 20:45:46 @danmurtaugh, since when is shale oil #cleanenergy? 
It's cleaner than coal but not clean...
7939 2018-07-20 20:45:42 You don’t seem to get that’s why having Germany cut off the money for oil is a BAD thing for Russia.

7945 2018-07-20 20:44:57 What nonsense, wages aren't "charity". But Corp Welfare is!... like oil subsidies, farm subsidies, large corporations who pay no tax. Charity is when employers pay poverty wages and taxpayers subsidize their workforce who require gov assistance.

7951 2018-07-20 20:44:11 Yea it's great to frack oil and cause earthquakes and pollute the water tables. Trump and the Republicans are PROFIT OVER LIFE!
7952 2018-07-20 20:44:05 Our "Phony War" in Iraq based on the lie of "Weapons of Mass Destruction" would have been a great reason for IMPEACHMENT. It was a WAR FOR OIL by the GAS CORPORATIONS.

7957 2018-07-20 20:43:18 You mean like those ones that have rolled enough miles to need an oil change and tire rotation? May God have mercy on your stomach

7961 2018-07-20 20:42:32 What about Essar oil scam
7962 2018-07-20 20:42:31 Yeah but the economy was smaller, and there was less inflation. What else is the problem? Venezuela literally can’t even produce its own oil anymore because it costs more than it gets for it, so it’s literally importing oil!
7963 2018-07-20 20:42:25 Hot oil treatment yes please
7964 2018-07-20 20:42:24 5時40分で！！！

7966 2018-07-20 20:42:13 I pay more for an oil change at Sears just so I don’t have to get hit on at other mechanic shops. Shit makes me so uncomfy.
7967 2018-07-20 20:42:09 Thank you for not writing about Pompeo going to the UN today to complain about Russian and China breaking sanctions by selling oil to North Korea. That would make it look like Kim, Xi and Putin are playing me for a fool.
7968 2018-07-20 20:42:06 That was the best part about driving a $1600 Chevy. I didn’t change the oil for three years.
7969 2018-07-20 20:42:03 The truth is the money belongs to you and me . Not Buhari or Jonathan . It’s not their money . Jonathan started and Buhari completed it . It’s our common oil money . Govt. is continuity . The Politicians are only fooling the people.

7971 2018-07-20 20:41:50 US intel monitors tanker traffic  because it is a strategic resource so US knows , what happens is a tanker carrying oil turns off uts transponder, meets with another tanker , transfers the oil , moves on and truns on the transponder whicle the "dark tanker" delivers the oil

7973 2018-07-20 20:41:45 @realScottWagner you lying, misdirecting tool. When a young woman ask you a question about your corrupt ties to the oil industry you belittle her and refuse to answer the question. YOU ARE NOT A SCIENTIST, so maybe listen to one about climate change.
7974 2018-07-20 20:41:37 Yup. Walked to lunch today after I dropped my car off to get the oil change, and then back to work. I was soaked...

7979 2018-07-20 20:40:40 MSG, palm oil. :( 
I like Marigold bouillon, but that has palm oil too. Now I'll have to look for something else or just go without.
7980 2018-07-20 20:40:26 I put any cheap ass oil in my 912E, usually. It's a Volkswagen motor with 200K on it. It straight up DGAF what oil you use, it'll burn a quart in a thousand miles anyway.

7982 2018-07-20 20:40:19 (1) Trump is destroying the Russian economy by turning the U.S. into an oil and gas powerhouse; he's forcing European nations to increase NATO funding; he's arming Ukraine; and he's slaughtering Soviet mercenaries.

7989 2018-07-20 20:39:08 Lots of countries produce oil.
They don’t have people eating zoo animals though.
The main driver of Venezuela’s collapse are its socialist price controls leading to shortages and currency controls leading to inflation.
The oil dip just opened the wounds
7990 2018-07-20 20:39:04 ...look at. Same with checking the quality of your oil. Maybe do that at home before having someone else check it out. Somebody is being dishonest, in any case, and that is f'd up.

7993 2018-07-20 20:38:16 Look Trump isn’t wrong a 100%, but he isn’t right a 100%.  The reason is Oil and recent Truck and gas guzzler purchases and Sharia law bias in OPEC supply decisions regarding the US interest rate.  Arab countries are trying to control our money supply with oil price fluctuations

7995 2018-07-20 20:38:14 I'm equally baffled. Some say oil was the factor for Libya but Cameroon have oil in quantities to die for.
7996 2018-07-20 20:38:11 it's about the wash, the oil, the comb, and the boar hair brush. but you already know that.
7997 2018-07-20 20:38:11 Yes.. taking a deep breath is good advice.. the whole Left side of America is in a perpetual state of panic attack !  CHILL PEOPLE!!
it is Natural Gas not oil, but still..If Trump gets Germany to buy it from us instead of Russia...Yes that would be a good thing!
7998 2018-07-20 20:38:10 i use organic cocoa butter mixed with organic coconut oil. stretch marks are inevitable i guess. 
7999 2018-07-20 20:38:06 Why don’t you call out worse polluters like coal in the US which is 1000 times worse than oil sands? No attention paid there? And the US has an interest in further investing in it. When you look at the grand scheme of things, oil sands pollution is minimal.
8000 2018-07-20 20:37:37 The fixation on oil money. What is wrong with "oil money" when it was earned and provided voluntarily? Where and what is the immorality? Shall we discuss how govt acquires its "treasure"?

Under nafta we get screwed for a bunch of things, including oil and energy (at least if Canadians actually need it, and we are running out, so it goes to USA instead of CAN )

8026 2018-07-20 20:34:03 Why am I winning so much at the gas pump? Why is it when these Republicans get in we have to pay double to fill out gas tanks while the oil companies are rolling in the dough?
8027 2018-07-20 20:34:00 It’s oil based paint
8028 2018-07-20 20:33:32 Republicans believe it is wrong to support wind and solar because it gives them an unfair advantage over oil and coal. So they routinely vote to hand over the exact same amount of money to big polluters. (For fairness.)

Republicans are idiots.

8030 2018-07-20 20:33:00 I vaguely remember a friend telling me about buying an old 911 (when they were cheap) and deciding to do the first oil change himself. He puts his plastic pan down, opens the drain, then starts reading the manual and discovers 12 qt of oil is about to flood his garage floor.
8031 2018-07-20 20:32:59 Aye so I leave my Carmex in the car and it be melted but it’s like this nice ass chapstick oil

8039 2018-07-20 20:32:14 How much does a potato cost? How much does a deep fryer cost? How much does the oil cost in the deep fryer? How often do you have to change the oil? How much does that thing that cuts the potato’s into frys cost? How much do you value the labor of the person cutting and frying?
8040 2018-07-20 20:31:55 Also Soy oil is in the same category and is also high in Omega 6 and Inflammatory. Our Fat also stores Omega 6 so we want to flush it with Omega 3 foods like Soaked Chia seeds, whole olives, Avocado, Oil Fish and grass-fed animals when possible.

8059 2018-07-20 20:29:14 You get a lot of publicity ans some oil money with this kind of work. Again, astrophysical observations are going in the exact opposite direction : cooling.

8064 2018-07-20 20:28:54 The conspiracy theorists need to explain why Trump's administration has made *so* many policy decisions that hurt Russia's interests. Everything from NATO funding, to lower oil prices (50% of Russian tax revenues), to restoring US military funding.
8065 2018-07-20 20:28:45 That’s a lot of oil but I can understand it.

8069 2018-07-20 20:28:11 I spilt oil everywhere around my oven because I'm stupid and the only thing my last brain cell could think of was the "run in here and come get y'all juice" vine
8070 2018-07-20 20:28:06 Not "a refinery," it was the third largest oil-refining center in the world. The question "how did singapore fund its policies of subsidized housing and english-language schooling" is answered with "oil money"
8071 2018-07-20 20:27:46 I really hope I'm not allergic to this essential oil blend omg... my neck has been itchy lately.

8081 2018-07-20 20:26:21 Went to lunch with my co-workers to eat. Next thing you know we at 7 eleven buying a brew and someone pops out a oil pen .
8082 2018-07-20 20:26:04 Here in the states CBD Oil is the big thing. Get yourself some weed or the CBD oil and hopefully that can help ya.
8083 2018-07-20 20:25:39 for me it helps control oil, balances the moisture in my skin.
8084 2018-07-20 20:25:38 My favorite part of getting an oil change is walking next door to Lowes Foods for an 11% beer.

8086 2018-07-20 20:25:09 Furthermore, those high gas prices we are expiriencing? Caused by CAD devaluation because oil industry depressed because we cant get oil to foreign markets. Thanks BC and QC.

8092 2018-07-20 20:24:45 Maybe the same kind of chowderhead that buys oil in the Permian basin when there is not enough pipelines to get it out.
8093 2018-07-20 20:24:39 Use coconut oil instead of aloe gel on your sunburns and thank me later 
8094 2018-07-20 20:24:26 The item already exists, it doesn't need to be introduced. Since you're making so much fuss about the planet, I presume you are a vegan who doesn't buy products with palm oil, has a green energy supplier and uses tea bags which are fully biodegradable?

8097 2018-07-20 20:24:13 I'm not pretending that the 60s two stroke is in any way green, it ran a 20 to 1 oil mix! But I wasn't even trying to get good efficiency out of it.
8098 2018-07-20 20:23:31 I can’t find my mint oil 
8099 2018-07-20 20:23:29 Not as good as America 
Malaysia is dry and hard and doesn’t even look like weed it’s low grade stuff but gets the job done lol

And New Zealand you can get strains but it’s expensive $20 a gram and you aren’t even guaranteed a full gram :/

8105 2018-07-20 20:23:10 Venezuela was really wealthy but suffered from extreme dutch disease, singapore used their oil money to successfully diversify their economy which venezuela failed to do. Not difficult!

President Muhammadu Buhari diplomatic visit to the Netherlands this week has yielded an investor inflow of $5 billion to the oil sector ! Sai Baba!

And there are investments coming to support our Ranching initiatives. 
Another Sai Baba.

8112 2018-07-20 20:21:58 Had to pay $37 to get our own oil because @jiffylube ran out of the kind they needed for our truck...then they didn't reimburse us and also charged us an additional $20 for the oil change. What's the deal with that???

8115 2018-07-20 20:21:51 Hi Sean, We are sorry to hear about this. We would like to look into this for you. Could you DM us more details on your oil change?
8116 2018-07-20 20:21:47 A seed oil is a vegetable oil that is obtained from the seed (endosperm) of some plant, rather than the fruit (pericarp). Most vegetable oils are seed oils. Some common examples are sunflower oil, canola oil, and sesame oil. Some important vegetable oils are not seed oils.
8117 2018-07-20 20:21:46 Yes yes and we stole their oil too!  Good excuse for everything.  Or maybe Dudayev represented legitimate independence movement, and Ukraine was sick of well known horribly corrupt leader?  Yet Russia had to escalate to war.  Whatever man this goes nowhere.

8124 2018-07-20 20:20:42 If an oil refinery can create a wealthy country then Venezuela should be the wealthiest nation on the planet as it has the most proven oil-reserves on the planet. LOTS of refineries there
8125 2018-07-20 20:20:37 حاضر
8126 2018-07-20 20:20:33 I know. They're both major oil exporters sounds funny.

8130 2018-07-20 20:19:52 tRUmp is giving up defense of it...wondering about the sanctions on Russia,  will they be lifted?  Mega millions profit in oil there, remember Tillerson wanted a drilling deal with Russia, Flynn lying about talking  about lifting the sanctions,  it's all coming to clear view...
8131 2018-07-20 20:19:44 I see how Saudi Arabia, Iran, Norway, or whatever other country whose economy is mainly based on oil has been destroyed by "inflation". 
And do you like how humanely your dear Socialism is shooting at starving people who DARE to protest? I know, nothing compared to Evil-Trump.
8132 2018-07-20 20:19:26 Stuff going on behind the scenes that media is missing will be catastrophic - ie selling public lands to coal and oil companies.
8133 2018-07-20 20:19:20 I SUPPORT THE OIL N GAS INDUSTRY!!! THEY ROCK! Your a FOOL if you think you can live without it! Did you drive to work? Did you ride your bike? Did you Walk? Your Welcome all due to Natural n Oil!
8134 2018-07-20 20:19:09 Hahahaha $200. For that much dough I could buy a real set of ramps and change my (full synthetic) oil three times. 
8135 2018-07-20 20:19:07 The only economy I care for is the relationship between supply and demand related to real, tangible, necessary-to-live resources and the responsible management of those resources: if there are decreasing oil resources, allow cheaper production of non-oil-requiring industries.
8136 2018-07-20 20:18:48 Just to left is Liberty Mational Golf Coutkrse. Was CFO for the design, creation and sale - non core oil asset! Long story!
8137 2018-07-20 20:18:39 Oh FFS. An oil refinery created a diversified economy of 4.5 million population with a higher standard of living than Western Europe.
I’m done. Read a fucking book.
Not just the first google article you find.
8138 2018-07-20 20:18:36 After today I may have to order more CBD oil. All people with illnesses today.
8139 2018-07-20 20:18:27 The claim is Fed shifted inflation target.  I am just old enough to remember it happening. Long discussion about how monetary policy really couldn't influence oil prices, etc...
8140 2018-07-20 20:18:26 The Iran-Russia oil-for-goods deal sounds logistically impossible.
8141 2018-07-20 20:18:15 i see people who dilated and still take that’s castor oil and still didn’t go into labor  so im not about to risk that’s life

8143 2018-07-20 20:18:05 The goverment and taxpayers are paying for a service of reducing emissions and pollutions and funding R&D and startup cost of a new type of less polluting vehicles. This yields savings due to health spending being lower among other benefits like less oil dependence.

8150 2018-07-20 20:17:17 It would be great but it will be a long time before we can replace all the products that need oil in their production. There are over 6000 everyday products that use crude oil. Only around 17% of a barrel of oil used for fuel.

Nigeria that still sees oil as the way to wealth 
I feel Nigeria is a lost nation
8155 2018-07-20 20:16:23 Since when does, oil drilling & fracking apparatus equate to splendor & beauty?
Part time low paying jobs with no benefits shouldn't even count.
8156 2018-07-20 20:16:07 Oh please lay off the conspiracy theories and be honest.  The US did not steal anyone's oil.
8157 2018-07-20 20:16:04 He really didn't do much for his oil and gas friends.
8158 2018-07-20 20:16:02 Yeah, and it became wealthy because Shell started refining oil there

8184 2018-07-20 20:12:48 The Pro-terrorism crew buy oil from Saudi Arabia and back 75%of the world's dictators. The Pro-terrorism people support a country that commits human rights abuses.

8201 2018-07-20 20:10:14 I think he'll never bat anywhere but 4th.  He must have video on Gabe using the coconut oil
8202 2018-07-20 20:10:09 It has been known that corn oil is toxic industrial waste since the Rose Corn Oil Trial in 1965.

8205 2018-07-20 20:09:58 ohhh most definitely! Salt, water, Lavender or Peppermint oil, Spray around the walls and windows.
8206 2018-07-20 20:09:55 Now essential oil and cbd users are going to start dming us trying to sell products
8207 2018-07-20 20:09:46 My older sister once wanted to make pasta having seen mom put oil in the water she knew it was ok. Instead she poured vinager and then forgot she had it on the stove the house stunk for days!!#MyWeirdSibling
8208 2018-07-20 20:09:36 It’s not about using fossil fuels, it’s about knowing the causes of burning fossil fuels and activity paying shills to influence public opposition... for 50 years! The Cato or Heartland Institute were paid by big oil to do so. Influence the public and prevent public action.
8209 2018-07-20 20:09:33 Olive here, brushed with oil, none in the pan, surprisingly it was 3 minutes a side.

8211 2018-07-20 20:09:25 Hey guys I learned a new lesson today. DON'T PUT PEPPERMINT OIL ON YOUR BALLS\GOOCH.
8212 2018-07-20 20:09:20 100% correct. From North to South and East to West. Europe including Britain sold the land from under our feet for oil. 1973-1978
8213 2018-07-20 20:09:14 You can seek out more Federal Reserve notes to feed your gods, but your state will truly have to pay for the ecological death and destruction reaped by the Oil Companies on your, once pristine and beautiful, now poisoned and raped, land and water.

8229 2018-07-20 20:07:49 bring a meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of oil.
8230 2018-07-20 20:07:46 Castor oil is actually amazing, it’s proper helped my hair 
8231 2018-07-20 20:07:29 It's Goya oil
8232 2018-07-20 20:07:23 It’s unCanadian. Par for course. Harper was there to loot the place for his oil and gas cronies and friends from his church and his Reform Klan.
8233 2018-07-20 20:07:22 I am still squatting my way around this great province of Alberta.  From Calgary to Grande Prairie even Fairmont and Leduc/Edmonton the past 4+ weeks.

8235 2018-07-20 20:07:06 Companies should not even use palm oil!
8236 2018-07-20 20:07:05 It’s a toss up between the pot of Napolian truffles and the Croatian pumpkin oil.
8237 2018-07-20 20:07:04 Riiiight, buy expensive American oil but then complain when they can't meet make believe NATO debt payments.
8238 2018-07-20 20:06:56 I the mean time we should be sending oil to the east so they don’t have to import expensive foreign oil.
8239 2018-07-20 20:06:54 My boyfriend putting CBD oil in my vape is the best thing right now. 
#cbdoil #vape
8240 2018-07-20 20:06:52 I will never in my life pay over $40 for an oil change unless it comes with at least 3 other perks for my car or tires .
8241 2018-07-20 20:06:37 -e
Maybe Alberta can separate from Canada 
-the oil barons get to keep all the oil money (or whatever they are willing to share with other albertans )
-but no bailouts from the Canadian gov including subsidies
Also you can't join the USA 
We can partner to keep them from invading
8242 2018-07-20 20:06:22 Yes we want a carbon tax to bring in revenue for green initiatives and to effect consumers and corporations decisions to be more environmentally friendly and pushing for innovation and research to discover better alternatives, or increase efficiency’s of current ones, to oil.
8243 2018-07-20 20:05:57 So much oil habibi
Next drone on you
8244 2018-07-20 20:05:55 No line while I get an oil change on a Friday? Day starting out well already 
8245 2018-07-20 20:05:53 It's like drilling for oil then ?
8246 2018-07-20 20:05:41 What are those investors coming to do in the oil sector? New refinery or loading of crude out of Naija as usual or u just feel like lying since its in ur DNA?
8247 2018-07-20 20:05:03 First, you need a lesson in geography.  They taught that in the classes that you skipped or fell asleep in.  We have an ocean between us.  So that oil to EU would be expensive.  But you keep that thought.  Literally, keep that thought.  Have a nice day.
8248 2018-07-20 20:04:59 my boyfriends family is chinese - my favorite snack is basically just white rice and fried la jiao you (sichuan chili oil) also i don’t know if that’s how you spell the pinyin, but this is great late at night.

8250 2018-07-20 20:04:55 It’s your job to protect the environment not obsessively gut and pollute it for oil, and gas.
8251 2018-07-20 20:04:53 DIY oil change from hell 
8252 2018-07-20 20:04:52 Protecting his country by wars and killing innocent children and holding hostage of little children it's disgusting his doing more damage than he can imagine he stealing the oil from Arab countries it reeks foul
8253 2018-07-20 20:04:45 #Transmountain situation was better six weeks ago when it was a business risk for KM, not for taxpayers. Even so, no I won't make that phone call.
Instead I'll continue to make choices, share information & pressure politicians to cut demand for oil from ANY pipeline.
8254 2018-07-20 20:04:37 It's a natural gas pipeline, not oil...
8255 2018-07-20 20:04:36 i just wanna learn how to change my oil 
8256 2018-07-20 20:04:24 My Mother has dementia heart breaking CBD oil needs to be made available this would help my Mum
8257 2018-07-20 20:04:23 Anoint my head with oil.. bring out what were once just possibilities
8258 2018-07-20 20:04:02 Iran had democracy, until the west dismantled it for oil...
8259 2018-07-20 20:03:45 and USA could probably build a bridge from L.A. to hawaii,  

but why and what do we have after spending billions ?

BETTER: 
jfk should have said " by 1970, I want USA to be oil independent"
8260 2018-07-20 20:03:36 Cant you two just wrestle in baby oil?  ;)
8261 2018-07-20 20:03:34 OMG, Dollar trading at 130 in a open market today. Btw we're an import heavy states - import petroleum, medicine, edible oil, fertilizer, chemicals, electronic, automobile parts, cosmetics, infant milk etc.
8262 2018-07-20 20:03:30 Is it on Lucas Oil tv as well?
8263 2018-07-20 20:03:24 Getting my oil changed at this moment in time and the big box places are absolute scam artists
8264 2018-07-20 20:03:22 1) It is a natural gas pipeline not an oil pipeline.

2) The US only produces 1/3 of our annual oil consumption. We are not going to sell oil to Germany.

3) Facts matter, your bullshit does not.

Have a good day.
8265 2018-07-20 20:03:14 Yes so when oil prices are dropping the top things you do not do are a royalty review, a business tax hike and appointing pipeline protesters as your oil sands advisor. NDP did them all. No government can be blamed for oil prices dropping its your reaction to it that matters dear
8266 2018-07-20 20:03:13 Them peanut oil fries can literally slap
8267 2018-07-20 20:03:12 I take it the oil patch is from yours not that one...
8268 2018-07-20 20:02:22 and crony capitalism. EPA officials who fight environmental protections and take money from big oil and coal execs. Charter school anti public schooling education secretaries. This whole admin is just a case for corruption and nepotism, international corruption included.
8269 2018-07-20 20:02:18 The ammo on some is from reloads - I assumed for those it was just low quality grain  used (not my reloads). Most of them are better quality. The Colt .45 had new rounds, 230gr. I generally use Rem oil accross the board.
8270 2018-07-20 20:02:11 I'm leaving work everyday this week with my hands having cuts and filled with grease and oil so my bank account can look beautiful
8271 2018-07-20 20:02:01 Add on to that that the dollar is the global oil purchasing currency, and we come full circle. The US dollar will not collapse as long as it is lucrative for the DS. The DS can’t stop f***ing with international politics....the Fed won’t go away until it is dismantled...Qaundary

8275 2018-07-20 20:01:29 Wonder how happy they will be when Putin nationalizes their oil companies?
8276 2018-07-20 20:01:24 i put baby oil on my legs & it feel like I’m cooking fuck

8278 2018-07-20 20:01:05 Well said. They slaughtered hundreds of thousands of Iraqi children. Innocent kids. Depleted uranium poisoning. Destruction of their entire infrastructure. And for what - OIL and high value contracts for the reparations. I am sure @johnpilger could add more!
8279 2018-07-20 20:01:00 Doing an oil change all by my self . #ThanksDad
8280 2018-07-20 20:00:54 InfoChip is the only custom ID provider focused on providing heavy-duty tags for the oil & gas markets.
8281 2018-07-20 20:00:49 Getting an oil change is honestly so annoying all they wanna do is tell you every little thing to pay for like broooo change the oil so i can go 
8282 2018-07-20 20:00:43 @EssexLucasOil is I-80 on Lucas Oil tv?
8283 2018-07-20 20:00:40 ICE isn’t military. It’s absurd to say Dem’s are against natl security! Dem’s are against ICE kidnapping children & losing them! GOP & Trump side w/ Putin over US natl security. Your selling snake oil in the form of a massive disinformation campaign. 
Military is appalled by you!
8284 2018-07-20 20:00:24 We allow drilling for offshore oil on the east coast but not the west coast.  We import oil to the east coast but can't ship CDN oil out east. We ship oil to the USA then buy it back as refined fuel. This costs us $Billions/yr!!! Now we want a CO2 tax? Stupid, stupid Canada
8285 2018-07-20 20:00:16 @treyanastasio hey trey...how do we dance while the world is turning and how can we possibly sleep while our beds are burning??  A little midnight oil tonight?
8286 2018-07-20 20:00:03 *the oil in condom have reduce

8289 2018-07-20 19:59:07 A yuppie libtard was running in electric mode at the drive-thru, so I decided they should pay more for annual registration because they’re not bowing down hard enough to the oil barons. #OhWaitThatHappened #Wisconsin

8292 2018-07-20 19:58:53 Does Putin want Germany to stop using Russias oil? Because that’s what Trump told Merkel to do. He wants them to buy our oil. You can’t honestly think that Trump is in Putin’s pocket? That is a conspiracy theory. And like all conspiracy theories, it’s bullshit.
8293 2018-07-20 19:58:17 Never try to slick a cheating ass can of oil
8294 2018-07-20 19:58:13 I ran outta CBD oil yesterday and literally my anxiety comes straight back, it’s crazy. I have some more on the way though. Hopefully it arrives soon! #CBDoil
8295 2018-07-20 19:58:10 He is trying to threaten Europe with mock negotiations with its deadliest and closest enemy. He wants the EU to be scared into buying US oil, and into making disastrous free-trade agreements.
8296 2018-07-20 19:58:09 I envy your oil.
8297 2018-07-20 19:57:59 -c
The rest of us will deal with climate change and other global problems, including green energy, livable wages, sustainable jobs, and creating a model for the world where we can live well but lightly on this earth, and if you're desperate when oil is gone, you can try it too
8298 2018-07-20 19:57:57 Lol.. I was just thinking organic chemistry.. What if there's something in the oil that neutralizes the compound released by the pepper
8299 2018-07-20 19:57:51 Priming oil caught my attention fr I’m getting excited and haven’t even gone on the website yet
8300 2018-07-20 19:57:48 I ordered some new art of the root oils goddess of power and cleopatra oil and I’m watching the tracker like I didn’t just order it yesterday.   A mess.
8301 2018-07-20 19:57:44 A friend asked me how to use watercolor the other day so I’m sharing for others who need help. Watercolor is the opposite of oil or acrylic. You work from light to dark so you want to keep as much white of the paper as possible. Build up with light washes of colors do darks last.
8302 2018-07-20 19:57:43 I wiped off oil from My face and fried pakoras in that oil..
Such is the state of my oily face.
Plus I'm sweating like a pig and i just got out of the shower. 

Death is the only solution that i can think of right now for myself..
8303 2018-07-20 19:57:40 thanks! ill check for the oil, fasho! just ordered a couple of the balms for my dad & I.
8304 2018-07-20 19:57:25 why are you covered in oil
8305 2018-07-20 19:57:24 Okay same I recommend the sunflower serum then oil begets oil
8306 2018-07-20 19:57:10 I'm allergic to prawns and might as well be to coconut oil.
8307 2018-07-20 19:57:09 It’s an Elephant candle perfume holder bottle Egyptian oil container dust attracting cup.

8308 2018-07-20 19:57:01 Don’t get a Mini Cooper unless you want to spend $85 on an oil change 
8309 2018-07-20 19:56:55 Little bit of olive oil, salt & pepper - wrap in foil & roast - that skin just slides off easy  and don’t be freaked when you next go to the loo 
8310 2018-07-20 19:56:52 It's a BG-GAT. I use the sticky paper provided with it. Can I add other elements such as oil?
8311 2018-07-20 19:56:47 I need a damn oil change
8312 2018-07-20 19:56:38 Take ya ass out and come back off that oil to get splacked
8313 2018-07-20 19:56:37 I just love baby oil  I use it for everything. And the smell isn’t too strong lol
8314 2018-07-20 19:56:30 That may or may not be true. However if it is so why does this govt say nothing about Human Rights abusers, the Saudis? It is the sheer hypocrisy I cannot stand. Iraq was all about securing oil for US. Dick Cheney is on record saying that was reality of invading Iraq.
8315 2018-07-20 19:56:26 .@BernieSanders is the #TrumpCrusher+ best believe that! @DNC to hooked on the Oil and Arms funding smack to lift a eyelid. @AIPAC luvs some Dem sweat
8316 2018-07-20 19:56:11 Hi @theLowCVP What’s the palm oil mix! If palm oil in it has the impact of deforestation for palm oil production been taken into account?
8317 2018-07-20 19:56:05 Stopped reading it like 20 years ago when it predicted oil was going to skyrocket and the bottom dropped out. He’ll, anyone can do that.
8318 2018-07-20 19:56:02 Have you ever seen the documentary “Merchants of Doubt”? If not, please do and you’ll find out where the “red on the inside, green on the outside” thing came from. Don’t be fooled by oil industry shills.
8319 2018-07-20 19:55:44 @jonfavs @jonlovett I also hate cilantro, truffle oil, and IPAs. I wish I didn’t hate cilantro and IPAs, but truffle oil is garbage and I can most definitely live without it.
8320 2018-07-20 19:55:21 Not tried it, probably won't now.
Going to have a can of neck oil in a mo.
8321 2018-07-20 19:55:15 Lmfaoooooooo josh is making more oil soon 
8322 2018-07-20 19:55:14 Like Venezuela rich in oil resources, yet, as a failed socialist country the people are starving.
8323 2018-07-20 19:55:05 Why do you think that Germany buys its oil from Russia instead of the U.S. anyway?
The price of oil, if it came from the U.S. would double.
Why do you think companies around the country started buying from all countries instead of the U.S.? Same reason.
8324 2018-07-20 19:54:55 I believe @ctstiles is still in
8325 2018-07-20 19:54:39 -b
What if all the anti-climate survival folks and cons go to Alberta- you guys get to keep /sell the oil, you'll be at high elevation in case of global flooding, and you can pay no taxes and use oil money to pay for services  (until it's gone)

8328 2018-07-20 19:54:28 I don't think for one minute that Putin is calling any shots here. Trump has never been and never will be pushed around. He holds all the aces. Putin has more to lose than Trump. Remember the oil pipeline to Germany. Right before Helsinki?

8330 2018-07-20 19:54:06 @SlicksJohnny @NickKoumalatsos ordered my beard oil and Slick Spray on Wed. Got it today!
8331 2018-07-20 19:54:00 Im gonna try oil my hair 4 times a week and see if theres much of a difference when i take it out
8332 2018-07-20 19:53:52 You just reminded me about the Balm. I’m still experimenting with that. But I WILL be reformulating the Eczema Relief Oil because I found a blend I like better than the current one.
8333 2018-07-20 19:53:51 I’m Colombian so I’m definitely selling drugs, but I’m plant based now so I might just sprinkle some  oil in my juices to sell 
8334 2018-07-20 19:53:49 Plus side: free oil change. Minus side: ive been sitting here expecting that my oil was getting changed for ~2.5 hours and the car has not yet been touched...
8335 2018-07-20 19:53:43 After living in Louisiana for almost two years, I can honestly say that I will not miss (in no particular order):
1.) the humidity
2.) Baton Rouge traffic
3.) the crappy streets
4.) people who don't use their turn signals
5.) the foul-smelling air from oil refineries

8336 2018-07-20 19:53:32 I don't blame them. US is about to strike Iran. This is why Trump was meeting Putin and why Bolton Is going along with it. An attack on Iran also fits in with the larger strategy against China who buy almost all of Iran's oil.
8337 2018-07-20 19:53:28 <cringe> Oil and gas, my friend.
8338 2018-07-20 19:53:18 I be so happy when I get a oil change
8339 2018-07-20 19:53:15 RT The goring and greenwashing began late 60's - 70's global cooling, global warming, oil crises, wind turbines and 2 1/2 generations later, mission accomplished .. much reprogramming needed immediately! Nuclear needs to be reintroduced and hopefully common sense will follow!
8340 2018-07-20 19:53:12 カメラワークめちゃくちゃ上手いけどTVでやるレベルじゃない気が……単価気になる
8341 2018-07-20 19:52:57 just use coconut oil with EVERYTHING
8342 2018-07-20 19:52:55 Always hydrate! Use moisturizer. Hada labo, rosken (untuk sensitive skin tak de fragrance, paraben etc), avene (but a bit pricey). Sunscreen jangan lupa. Facial oil helps too but better dia kukuhkan basic skincare first. Goodluck!
8343 2018-07-20 19:52:53 natural coconut oil ! the one i used is pressed
8344 2018-07-20 19:52:43 White girls swear coconut oil fixes everything 
8345 2018-07-20 19:52:35 Watching ah boys snap chap gives me a fucken headache lmao shit got like oil in the camera man
8346 2018-07-20 19:52:04 Mess in implementation of GST by modi how many times changes the rate,he was Gujarat cm vehemently opposed GST which brought by MMS in which maximum 16% tax n includes oil too,now no GST for oil,only phony & claptrap otherwise hindu vs muslim vexed animosity tat only this govt do
8347 2018-07-20 19:51:52 Hmmm my mom has cbd oil. Maybeeeee I’ll try
8348 2018-07-20 19:51:37 —What Trump gets: lessons on how to be a vicious dictator and his name on a Russian tower.  —What Putin gets: US Military, oil/gas and nuclear manipulation, places to hide money, and his  agenda to take down the west.
8349 2018-07-20 19:51:36 I would do what I always do: put out glue traps. Catch Remy. Put trap & Remy in tupperware with paper towel for comfort/cleaning off. Douse Remy in olive oil so he can extract himself from glue. Walk 7 blocks away from house. Release Remy into world smelling like Italian prince.
8350 2018-07-20 19:51:34 Followed..

Here's the short version:

Trump&Team: You help me become president, forgive all our Russian-held debt.. I'll lift sanctions, open oil reserves, import Russian firearms.. we'll make billions..

Putin&Team: OK..

Simple

8351 2018-07-20 19:51:22 toxic you mean like water near coal plants he rolled back or the soil near new oil exploration field he allowed?
8352 2018-07-20 19:51:13 AMAZED at Sephora's dry shampoo. It leaves zero residue compared to Morrocan Argan sulphate and actually gets rid of ALL the oil?? Dude.
8353 2018-07-20 19:51:11 why does my face produce so much oil when i take naps
8354 2018-07-20 19:51:07 What do passenger planes and oil production have in common. The fuel used on those planes are a lie. They use mostly none. Oil production is a revolving door. Always replenishers it self. Never will run out. Enjoy those high fuel prices. Not.
8355 2018-07-20 19:51:02 In addition, at a 1M+ cost per windmill they rarely actually pay out in terms of the energy they are generating...any actual payout is due to the subsidies in place NOT actual energy generation, their capital cost is equivalent to a conventional oil well.
8356 2018-07-20 19:50:57 Dem messaging would bethe bees knees if:
-90% of the media were run by Dems.
-A rogue foriegn power engorged with money and influence from Oil and Kompromat were illegally helping Dems. 
-Dems could stop millions of GOP from voting every cycle.

But dat MAGA doe, amirite?
8357 2018-07-20 19:50:55 Democrats pushing the idea that ideology changes human nature. Capitalists and Nationalists are evil in nature. Socialists, Marxists, Globalists are pure of heart suddenly and are beyond reproach.  
Ignorant and simplistic.
8358 2018-07-20 19:50:47 Doesn't take long when its commodities like fish and oil.
8359 2018-07-20 19:50:33 Have you heard of our lord and savior,CBD oil?
8360 2018-07-20 19:50:30 
8361 2018-07-20 19:50:23 *sigh*
what happens if you get fined TWICE in 10 years for monopolistic behavior? Especially if BOTH sticks in court....

you're looking at a very, very, angry FTC with some very, very harsh anti monopoly laws. As Standard Oil found out about 100 years ago.
8362 2018-07-20 19:50:10 I get so nervous when I have to go get my oil changed because my dad always does it and what if they ask me questions... he knows everything 
8363 2018-07-20 19:50:09 I hate the stupid Enron Kinder Morgan pipeline ad on the radio. Building the pipeline isn't going to make our oil cleaner, allowing us to sell our #DirtyOil at full price. We will still have to sell our dirty oil at discount price
#Enron #KinderMorgan #RadioAd #bcpoli #cdnpoli
8364 2018-07-20 19:50:05 Instead of buying the pipeline, give that money to tax payers instead of foreign companies, let the oil industry pay.

8366 2018-07-20 19:49:44 Apply the oil now.. shouldn't it have thesame effect? 
8367 2018-07-20 19:49:31 “Perfume oil” 
8368 2018-07-20 19:49:11 When granite slabs or tiles are optimally sealed, cooking oil or salad dressing can simply be wiped off. A good seal will not allow fluids and other substances to penetrate the stone.
8369 2018-07-20 19:49:10 I don’t care what u say, I’m an American living the American dream, in a beautiful country- unless trump destroys it. Putin’s Russia is a gas can, exporting nothing but oil. It’s economy is smaller than most states. Go live there.
8370 2018-07-20 19:48:56 Yes, that is ridiculous. Vancouver had four refineries till the 1990's now only one. We ship oil to Washington State and buy it back as jet fuel, gas and diesel.  It's one reason why the new pipeline is needed. It's not just for oil export
8371 2018-07-20 19:48:52 I do my Boxster oil changes at home for just about $100. I sometimes wait to change it depending on the price of Mobil 1 that week.
8372 2018-07-20 19:48:40 I’d like to change your oil  haha jk jk 
8373 2018-07-20 19:48:28 Put that oil in a pipeline!!
8374 2018-07-20 19:48:28 Oh! That's great to hear!! I should clap for the current minister of Finance for achieving that, especially as also under her watch corruption is not ongoing even in the oil, gas nd petroleum industry.
8375 2018-07-20 19:48:17 i've had chronic migraines for yearsss & recently got told to try peppermint oil on my temples & it works wonders!
8376 2018-07-20 19:48:14 Oil puked all last week. Going on 4 consecutive oil up days now and $XOP has gone no where.Not sure why I'm surprised . $XOP goes no where or down when oil is up and down a fuck ton when oil is down. Been like this for a while. Basically a waste of time.
8377 2018-07-20 19:48:12 current situation, dude smells like motor oil
8378 2018-07-20 19:48:00 Fire Zinke. He is owned by the oil and cattle ranchers ' lobbies.
He serves them. @
He gets them free public land
8379 2018-07-20 19:47:52 That would be stupid!  It will cost 3x as much to ship the oil across the ocean, not to mention the risks involved.
8380 2018-07-20 19:47:52 Rose-hip oil helped me!!
8381 2018-07-20 19:47:50 Sitting here trying not to spew because my maw is cooking with coconut oil.

Vile shit.
8382 2018-07-20 19:47:45 I have a strong feeling it taste like a fucking oil change

8386 2018-07-20 19:47:21 I have oil in my car. According to our source familiar with the oil industry 
8387 2018-07-20 19:47:16 “The energy struggle is for people’s energy so we can have autonomy over our land, river, oil, and it’s a struggle for socialism in Brazil. Capitalism makes the people sick. Communities are the seeds of the movement.” -Alexania Rossato, MAB #GGJMemberAssembly #NowIsOurTime
8388 2018-07-20 19:47:12 I don’t think people in Midland/Odessa realize that if the war starts, we’re going to be one of the places they hit first because of the oil.
8389 2018-07-20 19:47:00 Railroad Barons or Oil Barons are the poor cousins of Big Tech. Jeff Bezos fortune estimated at over 150 billion. Eat your heart out, Rockefeller!
8390 2018-07-20 19:46:55 How cool is Mrs Oil she's on it big style xx
8391 2018-07-20 19:46:37 We get oil from Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran (or we did till Trump screwed it up), and we have problems in those countries, so what's the difference.
8392 2018-07-20 19:46:06 
8393 2018-07-20 19:45:55 Caster oil makes your hair grow
8394 2018-07-20 19:45:53 Forgot about that groundnut oil hack while cutting fresh pepper and now my hand is on fire, fml 
8395 2018-07-20 19:45:51 Your timeline is muddled dear. Oil was dumping before the NDP got elected. 

I agree 100% with you in the carbon tax being terrible. It’s one of the most ill-thought taxes that could have been imposed on us. 

The minimum wage hike was long overdue. Sorry.

8398 2018-07-20 19:45:42 Coconut oil gotta be the best smelling shit on this planet
8399 2018-07-20 19:45:39 I mean Europe doesn't have a huge supply of petrol. Within a few decades it's going to start disappearing, but Russia has a lot of oil. Making deals with Russia to benefit your country is alright, but being a d**k to your allies and choose to Ally with Russia over them isn't.
8400 2018-07-20 19:45:21 This girl said that if someone takes her to a haunted house she’s bringing her bible, holy water , anointing oil & pastor 
8401 2018-07-20 19:45:21 She would use Oil of Olay, but it sounds kinda foreign
8402 2018-07-20 19:45:20 foreign oil imports to canada:
Algeria (17,942 M3 per day), United Kingdom (15,370), Nigeria (11,835), Norway (11,483), Saudi Arabia (10,922), Iraq (6,376), Venezuela (4,218), 
Mexico (4,089), United States (1,857) and 30,000 M3 a day  purchased on the open market-   Mar 2017
8403 2018-07-20 19:45:16 Election fraud is real and widespread
8404 2018-07-20 19:45:10 Honey coconut oil isn't good for your face. I can't remember what they said was a good substitute. But coconut oil yona, it ain't it hle ngwana mme
8405 2018-07-20 19:45:07 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
8406 2018-07-20 19:45:07 Yes and that what is still exported should be refined first. One thing is that we sell oil to the US and they sell us the gas made from it at a much higher price.
8407 2018-07-20 19:44:58 Colts fans must have to search hard to find things to take solace in. This might make for a good banner in Lucas Oil Stadium.  I'm sure it look good next to a participation banner.
8408 2018-07-20 19:44:57 When @StevieWonder said it’s Hotter Than July, he had to see the future. It’s July. In Houston....it’s cast iron skillet with oil ready to fry chicken with no A/C in the house on hot!
8409 2018-07-20 19:44:56 Grains and oil sure cheaper for china
8410 2018-07-20 19:44:49 Fire Zinke. He is selling off our public lands and national parks to oil companies.
Including the Arctic Wildlife Refuge parcel 1002. It is where the  Most Endangered Polar Bears live. 
Endangered.
He pushed the law that ruins their land where they live to an oil corp.
8411 2018-07-20 19:44:47 My favorite thing about those dawn oil spill commercials is that they went out and poured sludge on a duckling and an otter just so they can film them cleaning them up.
8412 2018-07-20 19:44:45 I'd be more concerned about the oil drilling off of our shores that  kill marine life & the literal trash dumped into our ocean.
Love you Leo!
8413 2018-07-20 19:44:43 my lil cameron got new air filters and an oil change 
8414 2018-07-20 19:44:42 2. It Means Buhari Is Really Fighting For Our Future, corruption is not as usual...
51 oil licences expire.
Now OBJ & TY Danjuma's wailing will skyrocket as PMB won't sign their licences.
THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS THEY ARE USING U NOT TO RE-ELECT BUHARI.
8415 2018-07-20 19:44:37 Lmao only getting a oil change and light bulb change
8416 2018-07-20 19:44:37 Multiplicative bitch momentum theory is an infinite energy source that Big Oil wont let us investigate.

8421 2018-07-20 19:43:08 BOOM!
Oil Licence not renewable, No wonder the sudden hate from TY Danjuma, Obasanjo, etc.
Oil Bloc Licences no longer renewable
- BUHARI
One of his policy that made TY Danjuma and other corrupt Generals mad.
OBJ is crying
IBB is crying
TYD is crying
8422 2018-07-20 19:42:53 I’ve face masked, shaved, exfoliated, hair masked, bathed AND showered, moisturised, put Moroccan oil in my hair and I honestly don’t know if I’ll ever be this clean ever again
8423 2018-07-20 19:42:46 I asked my boyfriend if he had somethin to help take off makeup like coconut oil, lotion, or something and the first thing he finds for me? Gauze strips

8426 2018-07-20 19:42:32 You girls feel so proud to kneel before God in church but you kneel down 2 hours to receive doggy style.. my sister your deliverance demands 50 buckets of anointing oil..
8427 2018-07-20 19:42:26 what  I told him yesterday I want him so let’s get it.. oil on %100 pull up with that heavy slow shit 
8428 2018-07-20 19:42:26 I'm with you. I think, we should heavily tariff imported oil, build the Energy east pipe so eastern refineries have more CDN oil to use and sell much less to the USA.  We import One million Barrels/day of foreign oil almost all to the East Coast.
8429 2018-07-20 19:42:08 Trade deal ? What, just phone the Chinese and tell them that we are selling them oil from the Falklands ? Get real, wake up and smell the coffee. Lets not forget Gibraltar either eh.
8430 2018-07-20 19:41:53 If the typewriter industry had a lobby like big oil, computers would cost $20,000 and we'd still be purchasing "white out.”

8433 2018-07-20 19:41:25 The EPA, psycho-environmentalists and courts are maintaining the inability to process oil into gasoline - thereby perpetuating the "scarcity" mentality.  we need to build MORE refineries, not fewer.

8436 2018-07-20 19:41:08 Yeah, Fields isn’t great. I was told that by my dealer up in NY. They’re pretty much the only game in town though unless you go to Tampa. Thankfully I’ve only had an oil change there so far.
8437 2018-07-20 19:40:49 You just going through it ... better find some coupons for the breaks and oil changes
8438 2018-07-20 19:40:48 Aleve and cbd oil does this trick for me! It normally fixes it within 15 minutes or so!
8439 2018-07-20 19:40:42 I use to do this as a magic trick.  Hide a test tube in the mineral oil.  Show students a different test tube, smash it with a hammer.  Throw broken glass in beaker of oil, say magic phrase, and pull out hidden test tube.  It was a horrible mess to clean though.

But politicians need to stop forcing bikes to share roads with cars.  It's oil and water they won't ever mix

Financially- surviving off the pennies I find on the street. 

God help me.

3. Russian Diplomats evicted
4. Scolded Germany for buying Russia Gas and OIl

8467 2018-07-20 19:36:13 The Canadian-US free trade act was passed by Brian Mulroney. John turner and Ed Brodbent opposed it. Also yes I am in league with American, which is why I want to cut oil imports and place tariffs on America.
8468 2018-07-20 19:36:09 I know I made a curry properly when it sits in the fridge and the oil from the coconut cream did not separate on top.  Sadly, I need a better red curry paste, preferably with more fire.

We need to start using oil and non-renewable resources more intelligently, not 'as quickly as possible in order to make as much money as possible in the shortest time'
The economics of oil is working backwards to what we need
Alternatives is the only way we survive economicaly

8476 2018-07-20 19:35:17 AMEN; so we knew the 3rd party candidates helped election night for a reason, we knew dark money (big oil/NRA) was supported by Russia, we knew Trump was being put in place by corrupt GOP to lift sanctions & they would get a pay check and we knew about cowards who did not  vote?

8484 2018-07-20 19:33:57 And yet nulear power kills no one.
Despite that greenpeace promotes wind / solar,  which is a euphemism for gas/ coal/ oil power
8485 2018-07-20 19:33:54 It's like when we had unsubstantiated "proof" of yellow cakes prior to invading Iraq and giving trillions of $ to the military & contractors, to kill millions, destroy infrastructure, destroy govt. & setting the Iraqis back a century, to control their oil.

8489 2018-07-20 19:32:59 I haven't dealt with anything chronic, but peppermint essential oil is a life saver for headaches. Mix a drop with coconut oil on your temples for a quick fix

8492 2018-07-20 19:32:24 Want to stop exporting oil cheaply to US? Stand with me against NAFTA. Want to stop buying expensive foreign oil? Support tariffs andOppose kinder Morgan for exporting oil while consuming more expensive oil elsewhere. you made my point, oil is only taxed once it’s out of ground.
8493 2018-07-20 19:32:09 Kung tama pagkaka-alala ko hindi TRAINL yung may kasalanan kung bakit tumaas oil, kundi yung global price mismo
8494 2018-07-20 19:32:05 Ok brilliant, think its is called an oil cooler. You could possibly make something up is they don’t have it.
8495 2018-07-20 19:32:03 -2
Alternatives to oil like green energy will reduce dependence on oil for energy and reduce big oil's monopoly on energy, which keeps Canadians alive in the winter and makes the economy go.
Better extraction tech will dev for tar sands, but we'll still need oil for some things

All this is bad idea. Voting requires a combination of skills, reasoning,  perspective, life experience and historical knowledge 16 yr olds dont possess generally.
8497 2018-07-20 19:31:33 Canada and Mexico were undergoing economic hardships in 2014/2015 coincident with oil's fall, a reason for US export underperformance.

8503 2018-07-20 19:31:01 So sorry to see you’re in pain. You’d benefit from CBD oil. Do some research, it’s legal and obviously from cannabis but they’re finding it can alleviate lots of symptoms for many issues. Great anti inflammatory. Take care
8504 2018-07-20 19:30:45 Decided to get gas and get my oil changed instead of going home and immediately taking my clothes off. #adultish

8506 2018-07-20 19:30:24 Ah.... With all the oil money?
8507 2018-07-20 19:30:10 honestly it's an impressive flex to break up with someone and then put all of their weird shit on the TL like you're selling an oil painting that has maintence instructions

8517 2018-07-20 19:29:13 I eat meat everyday now, even contemplated going carnivore, but my skin and eyes get really dry, so now I'm upping the carbs. Underweight keto isn't a researched well, I don't have any idea what to do. I try to eat, eat, eat, especially protein and fat (butter, coconut oil, EVOO)
8518 2018-07-20 19:29:07 I got a tan so quick the sun is not playing with my ass and all my fucken oil I put on
8519 2018-07-20 19:28:58 Yes, because CLIMATE CHANGE IS and you and @realDonaldTrump are colluding with the oil companies to deny it betraying your own constituents of a better solution than flood insurance.
8520 2018-07-20 19:28:45 @plutoearth00 I tried making enchiladas like my favorite style with the green duck thingy and fuck that. The oil burns. 
8521 2018-07-20 19:28:38 When Cuba lost its subsidies when the price of oil dropped, it became vulnerable to Western intrusions because it really needed tourist cash. Now that the price of oil is lot higher, Russia has eased out of some of it's problems

8525 2018-07-20 19:27:36 TRUTH is SUPREME. Blessings of the MOST HIGH be upon you. Nigeria has expired. AMALGAMATED from 1914 to 2014 to steal oil and gas by British Govt.... Solution to all the killing is REFERENDUM, so all parties can decide on how to control their areas.

Are we really better off? I don’t think so. 
8530 2018-07-20 19:27:13 Remember you're in California, it was probably thc oil
8531 2018-07-20 19:27:07 Baby oil>
8532 2018-07-20 19:27:07 no, you're wrong. 3 million barrels of oil a day is sold to the USA and the CO2 tax will apply to process of getting that oil out of the ground, into pipes and across the border.  Meanwhile, oil imported will face no burden. The USA consumes our oil with no burden.

8535 2018-07-20 19:26:42 Yes, I understand that oil was a big reason for the war in Iraq . And it is what repubs  always focus on. The prices of oil seem to be not so important right now. The bigger problem is loosing our democracy and being sold to Russia.
8536 2018-07-20 19:26:38 i like to season the oil too.
8537 2018-07-20 19:26:33 Economies can become richer in numeric terms, but that doesn't magically create more abundance of finite resources such as oil, gas, precious metals, etc.

8542 2018-07-20 19:26:14 ok that is interesting but what is going on in Venezuela/Sudan/Somalia/Yemen are the Germans still paying Russia for that pipe line-is there any oil left in the North Sea thank u

8544 2018-07-20 19:25:50 Those concern about the state of the climate are not alarmist. Those whose pockets have been lined by big oil for years are the alarmist.

8551 2018-07-20 19:24:52 Oil under the ground isn’t being taxed, oil taken from the ground and used is being taxed. That’s why it’s called an carbon tax, not a oil tax. Plus if I pull oil out of the ground and sell it, doesn’t the buyer have to pay federal sales tax?

8558 2018-07-20 19:23:58 Trump is telling the EU, he will offer them a better

Trump wants to undercut Putin's lucrative , deal with the EU, by offering less expansive oil from the US.
Does that sound like Trump is emboldened to Putin?
8559 2018-07-20 19:23:57 Todays teens live largely off Daddy.

8560 2018-07-20 19:23:51 -coconut oil 
The use of putting coconut oil helps make your eyelashes appear longer.
Also with time you will see that fewer lashes are falling out since the coconut oil  helps them grow thicker and stonger
8561 2018-07-20 19:23:45 I love the fact that basically every culture that grows pulses has different terms for what you get when you mash them up with oil and spices, and we try to look sophisticated by using some other culture's word.
8562 2018-07-20 19:23:31 i used pure coconut oil as soon as i got in the shower, left it on a while THEN washed my hair with shampoo instead of using a conditioner and holy fuck. it's so soft and nice
8563 2018-07-20 19:23:30 Expelled numerous Russian diplomats, closed Russian embassy, bombed Syria (Russian ally) killed Russians in the process, exporting Oil and Gas to Europe (Putins main revenue source) , Trying to block pipeline from Russia to Germany, expanded sanctions, Yeah, Sounds like a stooge?

8591 2018-07-20 19:21:29 Their problem is not to do with public vs private ownership, it's due to an economy which lacked the necessary diversity to withstand a more than 50% reduction in the value of crude oil. 

Their economy has been this way for most of the past century.
8592 2018-07-20 19:21:18 @EssenceVegas bought an oil cartridge yesterday, leaking today  hadn’t used it.

8594 2018-07-20 19:21:07 มันโป๊ะตั้งแต่เริ่มไงมึง
8595 2018-07-20 19:21:01 Oil
8596 2018-07-20 19:21:00 Hard border for pseudoscience. Say no to attractively packaged snake oil.
8597 2018-07-20 19:20:52 Or an oleologist...which is apparently an olive oil expert/somelier
8598 2018-07-20 19:20:50 So you get the "natural" peanut butter? Where the oil is at the top and you have to stir it?
8599 2018-07-20 19:20:49 Basic 'buckets' in the future could be solar cells, oil, 3D printing materials, perhaps steel/carbon fiber for printers. In general there's no reason why imports from china should continue except as specialty/cottage industry stuff.
8600 2018-07-20 19:20:28 Amazing stuff. If it weren't for these men, Norway would not have had its oil fortune. Incredibly, the Norwegian government waited until 2014 until they accepted their responsibility and apologised (after they lost at the #ECHR).
8601 2018-07-20 19:20:26 Ang funny kasi sa kagustuhan kong amuyin yung libro, dinikit ko agad sa ilong ko yung book. Tapos nagmarka yung oil ko sa ilong hahahahahha the book has been marked!!! 
8602 2018-07-20 19:20:21 That fish oil get you right 
8603 2018-07-20 19:20:14 This is a pathetic attempt to shame women into downloading a useless program because SPOT REDUCTION IS A MYTH! Use a new marketing strategy. Making women hate their bodies to buy your snake oil is so last century.
8604 2018-07-20 19:20:11 Do you guys remember when we used to put pink oil in our hair ? 
8605 2018-07-20 19:20:10 Pack ample vials of squirrel oil in your traveling rucksack...
8606 2018-07-20 19:20:10 Because these protections for endangered species keeps some of Donnie's buddies from being able to drill for oil where they want.  Forget the monarch, follow the money.
8607 2018-07-20 19:19:52 Oil and powder cant stop us !!!!
8608 2018-07-20 19:19:51 I vote for @HeartTaylor - he's lazy so give him some freelance work to keep him from sleeping.

Oh, also talk to us about booking Well Oiled Machines because as long as you can afford to clean the oil outta the canvas, they're gold.
8609 2018-07-20 19:19:39 Oil change and back to work for a couple hours
8610 2018-07-20 19:19:38 You know I’m finna have hella idea this weekend off the oil
8611 2018-07-20 19:19:26 -use castor oil 
Every night apply Castor oil to you your eyelashes this will help speed up the growth process.
If you want you could add a bit of coconut oil or olive oil if you find castor oil too thick.
I personally love this method.
8612 2018-07-20 19:19:10 I wish they would stop calling what Trump had with these women an affair. An affair is a beautiful LOVE  relationship. What Trump had with these women I would call a customary... oil change.
8613 2018-07-20 19:19:09 Oil and gas prices are going up
Do people ever expect them to go down again?
It costs more to extract oil from the tar sands than we make- oil tycoons are orchestrating for there to be scarcity and demand to push oil prices up so they can make their bad investments back

8614 2018-07-20 19:19:06 You can do a lot of drugs as long as you remember to take your fish oil daily
8615 2018-07-20 19:19:01 U.S. Rig Count is down 8 rigs from last week to 1,046, with oil down 5 to 858, gas rigs down 2 to 187, and miscellaneous rigs down 1 to 1.
8616 2018-07-20 19:18:59 Of all Presidents Mr Pompeo. You work for America.  Did Mr Bolton make the reservation w Putin yet. I’m sure he’s getting his dirty oil business done as well.
8617 2018-07-20 19:18:38 Just when you think the day couldn't get any worse, you accidentally pour balsamic vinegar instead of olive oil into your dish.  Good night.
8618 2018-07-20 19:18:35 Because of oil... Your government killed thousands of people in Iraq... Your government declared war on entire country because of oil in the name of terrorism.... That is your government
8619 2018-07-20 19:18:28 Of course he did, that’s the only way to export the oil $$$$
8620 2018-07-20 19:18:28 I’m looking for a vitamin e oil with only 2 or 3 ingredients .... any recommendations ?
8621 2018-07-20 19:18:25 I use cuticle oil as I have dry skin and my cuticles especially get dry and nasty if I don't. I like changing my mani every week because my nails grow at a freakish rate and there is always a gap by next Thursday lol
8622 2018-07-20 19:18:10 @Oil_Futures hi there. Are we moving into a contango market for brent related grades
8623 2018-07-20 19:18:05 On one hand NKorea talks denuclearization, on the other end it engages in shady business (oil+coal shipments, drug peddling for hard $$ cash,, cyber attacks)) with China+a few "faux friends" as enablers circumventing sanctions. Keep the pressure on. US Big Brother is watching !
8624 2018-07-20 19:18:00 Our aluminum bifold doors are incredibly low maintenance, they’ll look good for years on end – simply wash them down and use a splash of oil to keep them looking smart. #homerenovation
8625 2018-07-20 19:17:57 Venezuela's economic collapse is due to their economy's over-dependence on the petro sector. Their economy was booming prior to the 2014 oil price crash.

Before you blame that on socialism, Venezuela has undergone two previous collapses in the past century, with capitalist govs.
8626 2018-07-20 19:17:50 canola oil keeps being brought into my tl....
8627 2018-07-20 19:17:48 That little box is a heat sink for the oil from your photos it’s all as it should be. There is no pump you just run and external pump. Send me some more photos as I do have a spare engine mount for the side I can send you.

8633 2018-07-20 19:17:06 Trump made Saudis increase oil supply, pointed out that Germany is paying billions for Russian oil while we continue to be funding source for UN to protect Europe from Russia, blocked China's flood of cheap supply Now he's pointing out Federal Reserve interest rate manipulation.
8634 2018-07-20 19:16:47 It really is a miracle that our species survived the era of Victorian healthcare. People were clamping their nuts, dosing their infants with heroin, and popping radioactive supplements like it was fish oil for over a century, and somehow we didn't sterilize ourselves.
8635 2018-07-20 19:16:41 Petrol price dropped? Yes dropped steeply in world mkt,now crude oil price in world mkt roughly 68$per barrel but in our country 80rs per litre,in UPA period crude oil price 120$ per barrel at tat time oil price was 68rs per litre in our country,is this Acche din?

8639 2018-07-20 19:16:14 Just finished @riversofoilmpr podcast. A good look into oil pipelines, the pros, cons, and the balance between our rampant use of oil in our everyday lives vs climate and environmental impacts brought on by oil, oil spills, burning fossil fuels, etc.
8640 2018-07-20 19:16:09 Jesus wept, you're a lost cause.

Most resources are finite. We can't produce more of these finite natural resources, we're limited to what can be extracted. See "peak oil" for example

This is distinct from things like grain and other foods, which we can produce more of.
8641 2018-07-20 19:16:08 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, yet powerful politicians.
8642 2018-07-20 19:16:01 We never gon' lose if we handle this business
8643 2018-07-20 19:15:54 There wouldn't be nearly as many homes in "rural America" without the stronger economy that oil and gas provides.
8644 2018-07-20 19:15:36 It's rough being a Megaman fan because I just zoned out for one (1) second while cooking and got sad thinking about Megaman then immediately sprayed myself with hot oil 
(I'm ok but emotionally, ow, and physically, also ow)
8645 2018-07-20 19:15:30 I'm coming up on @TDAmeritrade broadcast to talk #oil! #OOTT

8647 2018-07-20 19:15:20 I’m sure not young OR naive and I want an Answer to Rose questions. Is you attitude to pollution and climate change influenced by oil lobbyists? ANSWER the damn questions! Is that plain talk enough for you?

8656 2018-07-20 19:14:13 A master artist and true genius. He revolutionised the techniques of oil painting to an unparalleled level.
8657 2018-07-20 19:14:00 Whoever first thought of the idea of using peppermint essential oil for migraines, especially putting it in a roller ball, is a genius, and I love them. #ThankYou
8658 2018-07-20 19:13:56 It's not double standards.. the transfers are funded by player sales.  Not from oil money from the owners pockets
8659 2018-07-20 19:13:55 @fbncountdown we have to change our view; before when we weren't one of the major producers and deliverers of oil we could say oil was evil now we have to say "Oil is my friend"
8660 2018-07-20 19:13:40 Save those takes for Thursday, need the Mitt back from Yukon!!!
8661 2018-07-20 19:13:33 omg try a cbd oil pill.
8662 2018-07-20 19:13:32 A thug like Putin? He just won an election in a secular democracy that hosted the World Cup and Winter Olympics, raise oil production to save our economy, DEFEATED ISIS and (oh now I get why y'all hate him) BLOCKED ISRAELI NEOCON RAPE OF SYRIA!

8665 2018-07-20 19:12:34 Rather then look to Republicans, why don't you talk to the oil sector in Alberta and see what they say about a carbon tax.  Maybe start with Suncor.  #ableg #neverKenney #outoftouch
8666 2018-07-20 19:12:25 Varies from source and priest's or church's preference. I used to work for a v traditional bishop in the CofE. His was a fine olive oil base with frankincense and balsam and something else. You'd have to check, and of course a priest may not know.
8667 2018-07-20 19:12:19 The guy changing my oil told me I can go shop for the 30 minutes it takes... he doesn’t know me that’s a bad idea
8668 2018-07-20 19:12:13 I use a CBD/MCT oil mix in my coffee every morning! It’s lovely.
8669 2018-07-20 19:12:07 Y’all worried about other things when babies are getting milked for their oil 
8670 2018-07-20 19:12:04 Good lord.  When did oil changes become so expensive??  
8671 2018-07-20 19:12:00 jackie, what tanning oil do you use ((((;
8672 2018-07-20 19:11:58 HD oil pumps have always been dependable. Typically, failure of another component would cause oil pump failure. Early Twin Cam pumps were subject to cam chain tensioner debris. Also, they were released with poor quality cam bearings.
8673 2018-07-20 19:11:52 You sure that’s valve oil ??
8674 2018-07-20 19:11:47 Well 'Oil' be dammed! A new @TerraTechGame video is out! Likely the last upload now till late Sunday/Monday as this weekend is super busy for me sadly! Enjoy :D

8678 2018-07-20 19:11:33 I don't use cuticle oil but I don't have much trouble with my cuticles. I do my own nails and I use UV gel polish which lasts a long time and helps keep my nails from breaking and peeling. This time of year, I keep them very short becase I garden quite a bit.
8679 2018-07-20 19:11:26 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output

8688 2018-07-20 19:09:07 Texas is the only red state that is relevant & competitive. Thanks to the oil industry. Can you name other one? Most blue states are relevant & competitive. This is evidence that GOP policies are shit & people in these places vote against their own interests. Thanks to Fox News.
8689 2018-07-20 19:09:06 I need to take my baby to get a oil changed  I’ve been being so trifling
8690 2018-07-20 19:09:03 Want a free cab Tucson Lyft is giving promo code, for up 2 $50 bucks. Enter LR1 as Lyft code,. Skip Uber. Super coup. oil
8691 2018-07-20 19:09:00 also, buy some cheap red pepper flakes, pack them in tightly to a jar, then fill the jar with canola oil and a dash of sesame oil, then let it sit for like a month, spoon that out into dishes as you see fit to LIVE
8692 2018-07-20 19:09:00 “Days Off” now consist of adulting like getting oil changes, paying bills, talking budgets with booster club, inventory on lax container, laundry, cleaning the garage, getting a workout in, and not drinking till the sun goes down.  67% of this was done before Noon.
8693 2018-07-20 19:08:50 The 20 year old me also needed an oil change 1500 miles ago
8694 2018-07-20 19:08:47 I always get oil changes like 2 weeks after im supposed to
8695 2018-07-20 19:08:45 "The goal of foreign influence operations is to destabilize society and undermine confidence in democratic institutions, impacting political sentiment and public discourse to achieve strategic geopolitical objectives."
Sounds like Democrats and MSM.
8696 2018-07-20 19:08:36 I recall a very very similar beast’s remains were found in an excellent state of preservation in the oil sands in Alberta Canada.
8697 2018-07-20 19:08:18 i wonder if the people in beverly hills who so vehemently oppose extending a metro subway line thru the neighborhood cared when they installed an oil well at BH highschool
8698 2018-07-20 19:08:12 This person next to me is talking about CBD oil and different strains. And I’m like ok old lady I see you

8701 2018-07-20 19:07:49 @MrMPS2002 what were the songs u used for grease and oil
8702 2018-07-20 19:07:29 Just because we had a summit doesnt mean were going to drop sanctions . Since the summit NK has got illegal oil and work on nuke weapons . Sounds like we need to slap more sanctions and patrol the water ways to control oil shipments !
8703 2018-07-20 19:07:18 Mind you that the global prices of oil increased; the TRAIN didn't actually contribute to all of that.
8704 2018-07-20 19:07:14 Does the study include no THC CBD oil ?
8705 2018-07-20 19:07:13 Have you tried peppermint oil?
8706 2018-07-20 19:07:06 Tar sands are a climate disaster! The oil from tar sand is twice as carbon intensive as most crude oil, doing twice as much damage to our climate @Barclays #StopPipelines
8707 2018-07-20 19:07:03 I'm just warning you now that I'm planning to have taken up selling essential oil candle crystals before you get here. I'll get you a great deal. And if you get ten people....

If look at % of Registered GOP (25%)
Even has 60% of that
He’s upside down
Blood in water now
8710 2018-07-20 19:06:58 @StewHansenCDJR is telling me it is ok to add a quart or more of oil every 700 miles on a 2016 @Dodge Dart that has a already gotten one new engine 
8711 2018-07-20 19:06:44 I do blame Bush jr for escalated gas prices. The Republicans sell for going to war was gas prices would decline. Of course they didn’t the oil cartel wouldn’t have that. We manuf. enough oil in this country to sustain us, but the oil cartel is a hungry shark that just wants more.
8712 2018-07-20 19:06:19 Happy Birthday. We may have some oil, but in reality we have the greater asset of you to which Scotland owes a huge thank you.
8713 2018-07-20 19:06:15 I kinda went off on the mechanic at Goodyear for tryna put 0W-20 oil in my car instead of 5W-30 and I felt like the biggest mom lol

8716 2018-07-20 19:05:24 Vibwgar/water. But  "Dawn " will do a better job on oil and grease.
8717 2018-07-20 19:05:16 RT ocean champion @SenatorCantwell: Instead of throwing out common-sense safeguards, we should be working to incorporate more lessons learned from tragedies like #DeepwaterHorizon to improve safety, oil spill prevention, and response. #ProtectOurCoast
8718 2018-07-20 19:04:54 Oh this must be why every year for last five is the hottest ever recorded. Brainwashed by oil.
8719 2018-07-20 19:04:32 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
8720 2018-07-20 19:04:21 Same here 
May be they think we can buy one because we live in Saudi Arabia 
You know everyone here has oil well in the backyard 
8721 2018-07-20 19:04:21 My former Guild president Sarah K speak to Tullow Oil Plc to help fund for new MRI, ECHO and ECG scans for Kiruddu and Kawempe hospitals.  Poor Ugandans cannot afford the fees of the scans from Ugshs 500,000. Most companies in Europe collaborate and support communities.
8722 2018-07-20 19:03:47 Yes Avocado oil is good too
8723 2018-07-20 19:03:41 Came in for an oil change, walking out spending $160  This car is lucky I depend on it. 
8724 2018-07-20 19:03:39 Couldn’t have said it better myself!!! Coconut oil is unnecessarily overhyped
8725 2018-07-20 19:03:39 Is alcohol an essential oil?
8726 2018-07-20 19:03:39 I can’t believe people are still wondering why Trump wants to be friends with Putin.  Surely you don’t think Trump has America’s interest at heart...  do you???  It’s all about the  and the oil and the biz....  don’t be fooled!
8727 2018-07-20 19:03:34 If you damage the economy, and a carbon tax certainly will, folks and businesses will have less discretionary money available to convert from oil to natural gas.
8728 2018-07-20 19:03:32 if my mood  wasn’t bad enough  i just found out  my car has a really bad oil leak  my step dad is suggesting i get a new car  yes this is just what i needed-
8729 2018-07-20 19:03:26 Im actually kind of disappointed. I really liked @jiffylube until they decided to charge me differently because Im wearing a suit. I never imagined paying more than $50 for an oil change.

8731 2018-07-20 19:02:53 Go and watch Mamma Mia at the cinema, or boil my testicles in vegetable oil?

Tough decision 
8732 2018-07-20 19:02:42 The Manchild Company is the 33 degree Olive Tree of Life of the entire universe. Fresh oil consume all the world today from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
8733 2018-07-20 19:02:39 It smells like coco butter, coconut oil, lavender spray, bleach & chicken tacos in my house 
8734 2018-07-20 19:02:33 Nope they are only interested in taking down Republicans and covering up for any Dem crime but no political bias of course
8735 2018-07-20 19:02:24 Hydroplaning off the road and getting flung from my car, flying through the moon roof and cannonballing into the oil tycoon’s olympic pool across the town, his henchmen immediately pick up lead pipes to beat me and evict me, I put my hands up, this is all a big misunderstanding,
8736 2018-07-20 19:02:21 Actually they might have same type of engine but thing is Ferrari are eating more oil and they have a better software for Hybrid system. Overall I cannot beleive how Italians can beat Germans on clever engineering?
8737 2018-07-20 19:02:21 Would you go to get an oil change without your car? 

Exactly.

8741 2018-07-20 19:01:15 Ross sat and nodded along a couple of weeks ago when it was explained to him how devastating Brecit will be for oil industry supply chain in North East. Yet he is still pushing for a no deal Brexit that will hit Aberdeen unbelievably hard.

8761 2018-07-20 18:59:33 You could do it cheaply by saying "we're going to impose climate regulation, therefore all this oil infrastructure has no financial value other then as scrap"
8762 2018-07-20 18:59:27 4 new tires , an oil change and then to get this crack in this window fix  fxcccccxkkkkk
8763 2018-07-20 18:59:25 Pretty sure TX was great before you and will be long after you...so why sell our gas/oil/minerals to the highest foriegn bidder?  Do you still speak Chinese?

8783 2018-07-20 18:57:25 I miss those days when we ate oily puff puff and clean the oil on our head. That oil gives sense more than impartation oil people pay to receive these days. #BringBackThoseDays

8786 2018-07-20 18:57:02 run the squid through a little flour, then into beaten egg then into panko breadcrumbs. Then into hot oil for 1 min!

8798 2018-07-20 18:55:02 Government support for oil companies is negative.   CBC is a drain on taxpayers and the have a sickening pathetic bias.  Always have.
8799 2018-07-20 18:54:57 She will receive slap for wasting oil to fry this much egg if not careful

- half a spoon of honey

8801 2018-07-20 18:54:43 @StewHansenCDJR is telling me it is ok to add a quart or more of oil every 700 miles on a 2016 @Dodge Dart that has a gotten a new engine 
8802 2018-07-20 18:54:35 I would agree with those 2 basic guidelines with a couple of caveats...beef is not a great source of omega-3 (grass fed is better but, still). Avocado & olives have mostly unsaturated fat. Better plant sources are chia and flax seeds and walnut oil.

8807 2018-07-20 18:53:44 It shouldn't be long enough to go below the oil level. Let it soak up the oil, the metal cap will float on the oil and use it as fuel once you light it up. Enjoy squinting in the low light it gives you! :D
8808 2018-07-20 18:53:40 U.S. oil prices climb, but end the week lower
8809 2018-07-20 18:53:19 It means banning the extraction of fossil fuels around the world. Otherwise you're just leaving more oil in the ground for others to burn.
8810 2018-07-20 18:53:18 I'd like to get my hands on one. All I know about my diff is the oil is $50 a quart.

8814 2018-07-20 18:52:54 The people running the city are ingrates. There would be no Baltimore as its known without oil. They should just ban oil! Go without. Freeze their numb asses off. The Mayor is in the crack pot category.
8815 2018-07-20 18:52:41 It would take more than POTUS praise to make Russia stronger. They are about 1/8th the US economy, the only real money maker is oil and gas and those are under sanction, their military is tiny compared to ours and they use mercenaries who are not necessarily loyal to Russia.
8816 2018-07-20 18:52:40 How much to oil the wheels of the gravy train?

8821 2018-07-20 18:51:55 Putin is a hard core capitalist and the richest man on the planet. What matters to him is sanctions relief; most especially the $500+ billion Rosneft/Exxon Arctic Sea oil drilling deal which got scotched in 2014. That deal showers $$ on him, Trump and many others.
8822 2018-07-20 18:51:50 Rinse with hydrogen peroxide then brush with Cocanut oil (its antibacterial) both will help and calm the nerve until you can get to the dentist.
8823 2018-07-20 18:51:49 Oil changes really take up your whole day

8825 2018-07-20 18:51:21 They love to protect their borders nice but they have other people's borders like #Syria to steal oil
8826 2018-07-20 18:51:16 Here's a recipe for a home made lantern (if I can remember it correctly!) Take a mason jar, fill it with three quarters water, fill the rest with oil. Find a piece of cotton you can shred into a wick. Find a metal bottle cap, punch a hole in and thread the wick through.
8827 2018-07-20 18:51:10 i live in the uk, but quite often i'm up during canadian time (burning midnight oil) and i'll often see him post. is the suggestion that HLS doesn't actually believe what's posted on this account, or that an assistant is stealing the platform for their own views maybe?
8828 2018-07-20 18:51:08 I’m sure that had nothing to do with the price of oil being so high and the liberal financial policies left to him
8829 2018-07-20 18:51:07 add castor oil to them nightly to help growth!
8830 2018-07-20 18:50:56 Started on my CBD oil today, anyone out there want progress reports? If you are thinking of doing the same?

8832 2018-07-20 18:50:10 Strange bedfellows ?  How about Israeli Likud Jews aligning themselves with Saudi Sunni Arabs along with Donald Trump !
These people stole over 3 TRILLION Dollars from Iraqi oil to pure golds !
3  TRILLION Dollars attracts a variety of thieves. 
Trump wants some.
8833 2018-07-20 18:50:01 What would you use CBD oil for if you got it?

8834 2018-07-20 18:50:00 Old cars are fat asses when it comes to needing oil
8835 2018-07-20 18:49:58 Anyone know if they are still chopping down the Rainforests that eat up CO2? Never hear about that now, or Oil spills muc. This GW paranoia seems to  ignore many factors while old culprits and pollution are being ignored . I'm a skeptic in this altogether.
8836 2018-07-20 18:49:58 What if a midget stripper with one arm jumped out a birthday cake covered in baby oil and powdered sugar singing "YMCA" while pop locking and dropping it. Would that surprise you.
8837 2018-07-20 18:49:51 Why does an oil change take so fucking long
8838 2018-07-20 18:49:15 Egg wey be #40.

8839 2018-07-20 18:49:02 Probably some disgustingly rich oil baron.  Not a lib, to be sure.  I'll bet today's lunch money on both.   More power to him (or her)
8840 2018-07-20 18:48:53 If you want exposure to the Horse Hill oil discovery you have to go with the front runner/market leader. #ukog it's the same as any industry or technology. The front runner always leads the way. Forget alba or dor as they will fall further and further behind.

8844 2018-07-20 18:48:10 Cutting RAF and Fuel levies will lead to shortage elsewhere. Why are people so stupid to understand these things. The only thing that'll bring the petrol down is the stronger Rand and lower international Oil prices. Anything apart from this is pure mediocre
8845 2018-07-20 18:47:52 You've mentioned this before but it's hilarious how they think we're all Koch funded sons of oil wealth or something. I don't make a grosze never mind a penny from this.
8846 2018-07-20 18:47:52 Use olive oil as a conditioner by leaving it warmed up on your hair for 15 minutes before shampoo.
8847 2018-07-20 18:47:47 That song took me back to university summers working the oil fields - all you could get was country AM radio. 

My dad’s favourite was The Gambler by Kenny Rogers. You never count your money when you’re sitting at the table. Keep doing the right thing without looking for reward.
8848 2018-07-20 18:47:47 Lol. Girs scare shitless.
Ordinary celestial church red garment that I displayed with red oil and two boil eggs in a bowl to prank my two lesbian CDS babes during NYSC days spoiled my continuous threesome parole. Girls took it for real, spread rumours.

8850 2018-07-20 18:47:20 breaching oil sanctions without chewing?

8851 2018-07-20 18:47:11 What chaos?...most of that chaos is from your side. Merkel has a big deal with the Russians for oil. Is it any wonder she is saying they cannot count on America...she's deflecting. Nobody can count on her.
8852 2018-07-20 18:47:01 What outsanding art? all I see is pictures of farm mach.  Money well spent I would have thought when so many are in dire need but as long as it keeps wealthy Londoners/tourists amused.  I just hope no more of Scotland's Oil rev has been spent on this as is usually the case.
8853 2018-07-20 18:46:56 European power siphoned the Middle East of oil and over threw all the leaders but when terrorist walk in and pretend to run the place they’re nowhere to be found thanks for coming to my ted talk
8854 2018-07-20 18:46:49 I’m trying to get my car to 5,000 miles so I can get my free oil change before school and work starts
8855 2018-07-20 18:46:29 Obama did a LOT to cost Putin money.
One of the reasons he didnt fight fracking was natural gas use instead of oil lowered oil prices which tanked the Russian economy.
Oil prices are creeping up under Trump.
What a coincidence.

8860 2018-07-20 18:45:21 You know he is trying to negotiate with Germany to get to stop buying oil from Russia and start buying from us. Don’t you think that is a good thing for usA? Everyone please #takeadeepbreath
8861 2018-07-20 18:45:20 My coworkers are fake af for not telling me I had white around my nose piercing  for 3 hours since I used tea tree oil on it.

8866 2018-07-20 18:44:55 There's nothing the government can do. We don't have oil in SA. Stupid people, stop blaming Ramaphosa for fuel price increases. There've always been increases way before him.

Who's paying these 'eco warriors'
8870 2018-07-20 18:44:40 I just went to @jiffylube . $74 for a fucking honda accord...... Ive remember doing oil changes on BMW M3's for that much  America is an unaffordable oligarchy...
8871 2018-07-20 18:44:39 CBD oil... Have you ever tried it?
8872 2018-07-20 18:44:38 are this for oil selling..as america trying for sanction..best try
8873 2018-07-20 18:44:33 Another 20 years of Scottish oil flowing away from Scotland to London.
8874 2018-07-20 18:44:33 try 
wormwood & blackwalnut oil
+
Cloves
8875 2018-07-20 18:44:31 Why are low oil prices GOOD but low soybean prices are BAD? Eagerly await your response, you stable genius.
8876 2018-07-20 18:44:21 People are so stupid. What do you want the government to do? Let's say the government cuts RAF and Fuel Levies. The price will go down to around R10. Then the Rand weakens and Oil prices increase. There'll still be increases in the absence of fuel levies. See the bigger picture
8877 2018-07-20 18:43:42 Sept bonds are down more than a handle today, meaning yields are UP.  Dollar Index is DOWN.  Usually, higher U.S. rates means stronger Dollar.  Crude oil has calmed down and stock indices are flat.  So, we must watch to see if bonds decide to recover as they have done this week.
8878 2018-07-20 18:43:39 Yes that why NPA and loan defaulted grew humoungously in UPA era. Oil dues crossed thousands of crores and Chindambaram amassed 3lac crores in assets.. Indians know who is the real thief.. try preaching to brainless Pidis only who think CONgress may have any future !!
8879 2018-07-20 18:43:25 Made marinara: good shit but I had it on some frankfurters and me insides are runny

Overdid the Olive oil? Is my digestion just weak?
8880 2018-07-20 18:43:17 So was I. SA blocked oil supplies at the time.
8881 2018-07-20 18:43:00 I like when I was getting yelled at about the oil. 
He said what are you trying to do, ruin the motor???
I was like no...that’s exactly what I was trying NOT to do...duh, lol
8882 2018-07-20 18:42:58 เอ๊ะ...oil price rises >>> boost import นี่มันเพราะอะไรนะ...คิดไม่ออก...
8883 2018-07-20 18:42:57 Idk I work in the diesel industry and nobody tips me? If I’m getting my oil service done I ain’t tippin, nothing against you James but idk
8884 2018-07-20 18:42:54 Love this 4 carriage train going all the way from Victoria to Brighton, @SouthernRailUK, which departed at 1925. 4 carriages. Four! Cover us all in oil and call us sardines.
8885 2018-07-20 18:42:49 I was one of them , until I woke up to brexit Britain , colonial rule over Scotland , parasitism of North sea oil , then being called a parasite for getting 8% returned of what should have been 100%.

Even Tories are now thinking unionism is dead - and all you have is sectarians
8886 2018-07-20 18:42:40 Drive through Southeastern Louisiana and meet with all of the people still suffering from the BP oil spill, and look at all of the land we continue to lose from canals dug for the convenience of the oil industry and then talk about how great fossil fuels are for us.
8887 2018-07-20 18:42:32 انا الوحيد بالبيت الي متحمس وهذي اخر سنه ثانوي

8890 2018-07-20 18:42:20 Or...science works better than magical thinking and snake oil.
8891 2018-07-20 18:42:17 Well, until the whole “war for oil” thing. . .
8892 2018-07-20 18:42:15 I wonder if  our/US admin w/ putin  RU gas /oil investments will take a hint from other.. countries including some repressive regimes .. that ..  are actually working w/the Paris Agreement .. like China. ..  just idk.

8894 2018-07-20 18:42:03 I wasn't aware that oil had been discovered in Baltimore.......
8895 2018-07-20 18:42:02 #NowPlaying on RADIO COCCINELLE la radio OVNI  midnight oil - put down that weapon put down that weapon midnight oil midnight oil - put down that weapon midnight oil - put down that weapon midnight oil put down that weapon
8896 2018-07-20 18:41:49 The guy changing my oil just looked at me and said " damn I'm sweating like a whore in church out here"
8897 2018-07-20 18:41:43 I want an oil change for the free
8898 2018-07-20 18:41:40 Have you any oil field jobs....
8899 2018-07-20 18:41:36 Hey Channon; I used to work at chipotle, that salad dressing is 3/4 bran oil and then it’s just red wine vinegar, adobo and honey. So it’s not vegan or healthy. And the rice we pour tons of oil into it. Not healthy either, just thought I’d inform you. Not trying to upset you
8900 2018-07-20 18:41:35 Tasted like shit, too much oil in it. I had to eat eba when I got back to my place so I won't puke
8901 2018-07-20 18:41:24 Just chug olive oil fucking twinks. take the GOOOAD pill
8902 2018-07-20 18:41:24 Not surprised that rural reform is slow. But even the bare minimum you’d expect of them: military presence in zones with lots of oil/extractives? They didn’t even fill the vacuum there. The Caño Limón pipeline has been out of commission for most of the last 6 months for instance.
8903 2018-07-20 18:41:17 This is a fun game  been ages since we played it. We have a German copy and slowly translated the names of goods etc. My daughter nearly died laughing when one of the clothing goods unexpectedly turned out to be fish oil.
8904 2018-07-20 18:41:12 They are the party of the short attention span. A week ago Trump was criticized for opposing Russia’s oil/gas pipeline to Germany. This week he’s criticized for trying to negotiate peace with Russia. Next week?
8905 2018-07-20 18:40:53 VITAMIN C OIL!!!! MARSHALLS FIVE DOLLA
8906 2018-07-20 18:40:53 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.
8907 2018-07-20 18:40:52 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
8908 2018-07-20 18:40:48 slept with coconut oil in my hair, never again.
8909 2018-07-20 18:40:40 Preach. Driving to Hilton Head later. Got the gas tank full, oil changed and car cleaned.
8910 2018-07-20 18:40:21 @FrederickMotor @SubaruCustCare call Subaru dealer 3 has ago about my unsatisfactory service and no call back #disappointed about oil consumption problem #subarulies
8911 2018-07-20 18:40:16 okay I acted like my potatos were nbd but actually I fried garlic and green onions and thime and pepper in butter and a little olive oil and then added the potatoes to that before mashing and then hydrating with cream and seasoning with creole seasoning so... they actually rule
8912 2018-07-20 18:40:15 Fish and oil are natural resources where there's always a market.
8913 2018-07-20 18:40:09 Canada has the third largest oil reserves of any country in the world after Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.
8914 2018-07-20 18:39:52 Incident 20/07/2018 17:49 Oil leaking from tank sealed with paste #Corby
8915 2018-07-20 18:39:40 studies confirm that that once Trump abolishes a crucial regulation, a true #Christian assumes he is winning #tiredofwinning
8916 2018-07-20 18:39:37 Oil changes make me realize how impatient I really am
8917 2018-07-20 18:39:22 I usually use a pear instead of pineapple and less garlic.  Also, he adds MCT oil now.
8918 2018-07-20 18:39:13 Quarter of blow , hash oil , bud , LSD , a couple pressies,  paraphernalia , intent to sell , trafficking , I’ll look through my desk tonight and see if I can find the arresting papers lol. The mug shot is fucking legendary though 
8919 2018-07-20 18:39:11 W$BIOAQ @ .0685 is emerging #bankRuptcy, should be trading in dollars per share shortly. BK closed. #loadingZone #biotech $ELTZ #OIL
8920 2018-07-20 18:39:00 clearly know nothing about cars cause whole time my steering wheel been shaking and im thinking i need a oil change when its really the tire 
8921 2018-07-20 18:38:25 @FriedgeHNIC @DuckMillard 
Seriously tho Fellas ,Would you think he'd waive his no trade for Edmonton? He is always well liked here by Fans and stranger things in Hockey have happened before and I highly doubt the Rangers are gonna win a cup before he retires. Oil can take on 8.5
8922 2018-07-20 18:38:21 broken piston ring leads to oil burning and blow-by which is even more oil burning................oil pressure light comes on...........red lights are a distraction..........soooooooooooo, yeah!
that's why it's called an "Idiot Light"
8923 2018-07-20 18:38:14 Trump is taking away protections on endangered species. Guess he's trying to help his buddys be able to drill oil. How much of a kick-back will he get from this?
8924 2018-07-20 18:38:06 I have having a medical card I got a good gram of oil for $10.50 
8925 2018-07-20 18:38:01 I exfoliate with Tarte Knockout daily and I use HA then rosehip seed oil. I feel like that really soothes my skin. I love squalane, too! TO carries both oils. Also, in case your skin has an adverse reaction I would rinse it off right away with cool water. (2)
8926 2018-07-20 18:37:52 Boost body lotion with baby oil If you?re craving shiny legs that aren?t greasy.
8927 2018-07-20 18:37:50 Make salad dressing! Mix 3 parts sesame oil with 1 part rice vinegar and 1 part tomato paste. Add shallots and jaggery to taste.
8928 2018-07-20 18:37:35 and they have the largest proven oil reserves in the world, they should all be living like sheiks
8929 2018-07-20 18:37:30 Amazon Prime Day did it again, and now I have an essential oil diffuser and 120 assorted gel pens. 

My order says I’m an adult, but only kinda.
8930 2018-07-20 18:37:05 Recien cargué gas oil y el camionero me dijo lo mismo...
8931 2018-07-20 18:36:55 Poor Assad. America for oil, strategic depth, golan heights used the pretext of Sep 11 to train Sunni Jihadis with Saudi support to destroy secular Syria. Take a tour, Syria with some of world’s oldest christians was made unsafe by those Jihadis, christians there love Assad.
8932 2018-07-20 18:36:35 Alaskans own 16,272 shares of SHAWCOR LTD, worth $474,989. It's from the OIL SERVICES sector, based in CANADA.
8933 2018-07-20 18:36:23 First Oil Change 
8934 2018-07-20 18:36:14 I came home to get my car inspected. I ended up getting the car inspected, getting a oil change, getting new tires and buying my grandma a new phone
8935 2018-07-20 18:36:09 You’re welcome! I think HA is already in TO’s Lactic 5% but that also doesn’t mean you can’t use some more — HA is a great hydrator (usually). However, bc acids can disrupt your barrier, you might need some oil, too. (1)
8936 2018-07-20 18:36:04 Is that oil paint?
8937 2018-07-20 18:35:56 The messeges were sent before the summit my friend. A shit eating grin  is exactly what the left wanted to run with.

A snap of his fingers and putin loses an arms race, hands down, vs NATO. Didnt cost the US a dime

Exposed oil trade between germany and russia. He Could end it
8938 2018-07-20 18:35:56 Does tea tree oil really work on pimples?
8939 2018-07-20 18:35:55 When I was in school, we learned about the oil sands as an integral part of Alberta's economy, and we had resources sponsored by oil companies. 

I don't remember  people being so mad.
8940 2018-07-20 18:35:47 come on, u had enough oil guys ..
8941 2018-07-20 18:35:42 I feel so bad cheating on Honda for somewhere else for my oil
8942 2018-07-20 18:35:34 200で心折れた
8943 2018-07-20 18:35:26 Ramen noodles (cooked and drained), tossed with oyster sauce and sesame oil
8944 2018-07-20 18:35:25 Yup. Trudeau has adopted Harper's worst policies. Electoral reform, Saudi weapons deal, garbage CO2 emissions targets, oil pipelines, Israel, TPP, corporate tax cut, fighting First Nations kids over meds, increasing military spending.
8945 2018-07-20 18:35:23 I like argan oil! Also sometimes your scalp can overproduce oil if it's too dry 
8946 2018-07-20 18:35:23 @Motul. Ook in #Vierlingsbeek/@Mar_oil @MarcOudenhoven
8947 2018-07-20 18:34:55 Your Glaceon Boyfriend can be very sensitive to heat sometimes. Probably your favorite way this shows is when he is using a skillet to make bacon and he insists on wearing not only his apron, but also a pair of baking mitts. "The oil burns!" He protests when you tease him.
8948 2018-07-20 18:34:49 soak it with sea salt!!!! or if you have tea tree oil
8949 2018-07-20 18:34:46 All parties are taking the same uninformed stance re cannabis oil. No one holds a moral majority here.
8950 2018-07-20 18:34:43 Coz it's Tabayog :-)
8951 2018-07-20 18:34:33 Threshold > oil paint + half assed shading
8952 2018-07-20 18:34:23 また時計が早漏になっとる
8953 2018-07-20 18:34:19 They got the oil mate.....
8954 2018-07-20 18:34:11 Going to get your oil changed is the most terrifying thing as a clueless girl. They could bring me a piece of bologna they found in the trash and tell me it’s a part of my car that needs replacing and I’d still be like yeah sure, let’s do that, sounds great, take my money
8955 2018-07-20 18:34:09 Lavender oil
8956 2018-07-20 18:33:59 334
8957 2018-07-20 18:33:58 It would be nice that the Norwegian company @Equinor stop searching for oil un the nicaraguan pacific coast with #petronic , whose president Francisco López has been recently sanctioned by the US for corruption. No money for the regime. #SOSNICARAGUA #GritopoNicaragua
8958 2018-07-20 18:33:41 (Dry continued)
1 Tsp Allspice
1 Tsp ground ginger

In another bowl combine: (Wet)
2 medium courgettes grated (approx 2 Cups)
2 mashed ripe bananas
4 Tbsp Olive oil
5 Tbsp honey
3 Tbsp coconut sugar or dark/muscovado sugar
Zest of 1 lemon
1 Tbsp vanilla extract
Whisk in 3 eggs
8959 2018-07-20 18:33:38 Awful.. there is no evidence of cannabis oil causing harm. Unlike seizures. Why are people waiting for permission from people who are NOTHING to do with them? Do whatever's needed, morally.
8960 2018-07-20 18:33:24 I like oil better than lotion! 
I’m soft and slippery all day!
8961 2018-07-20 18:32:52 o-oh. What oil? I try to avoid that word since my hair gets oily normally
8962 2018-07-20 18:32:48 with due respect ma, Ethiopian airline made more money from EA than our oil revenue. So why the fuss about Nigeria Air? You have seen the business model. The FGN is not running a business so why are u so worked up. why can't be happy for the Govt.  $400m abj stadium built by OBJ
8963 2018-07-20 18:32:43 I don't want you loosing any sleep Doc worrying about how much Oil is those stock tanks on site! A little bird told me there is plenty . Have a nice weekend  :)
8964 2018-07-20 18:32:34 #IndiaTrustsModi, dollar at all time high, oil at all time high, growth at all time low, unemployment at all time low, sense of fear at all time high, democracy at all time low and many. But who cares we want someone who just talks..
8965 2018-07-20 18:32:19 The breath of life is breathing in the anointing oil, the atmosphere of the tree of life.
8966 2018-07-20 18:32:02 IF YOU IN THE DMV HIT ME UP FOR ANY CAR ISSUES BREAKS OIL CHANGES ANYTHINGG SKIP THE SHOP PRICES AND GET YOUR CAR FIXED FOR THE LOW A SIMPLE RETWEET CAN HELP ME FINISH STARTING MY BUSINESS !
8967 2018-07-20 18:32:02 Aloe Vera stimulates hair growth just like castor oil.
8968 2018-07-20 18:31:55 I couldn't eat it, oil was too much inside, I wanted to throw up.
It's like it's you that made the egg roll, how can you tell it was tasteless, turn on your location plis we need to talk.
8969 2018-07-20 18:31:48 I've alternated between cleansers & toners w/ tea tree oil & that's done wonders reducing breakouts (nearly eliminated!), but I'm still left some discoloration/ marks. Someone recommended rosehip seed oil over a gel moisturizer at night to help repair leftover damage, so 
8970 2018-07-20 18:31:40 Oil
8971 2018-07-20 18:31:37 Texas seems so much like Nigeria. The weather , the oil , the size. 

It’s like a developed version of Nigeria.
8972 2018-07-20 18:31:36 As are we.  Our whole family has seen change since Trump took office.  Three of us work in the Oil & Gas industry & went thru long layoffs under Obama. O&G production was cut & engineering jobs were nonexistent. 

My sons will really benefit from the childcare tax credit, too!
8973 2018-07-20 18:31:36 The truth is much worse. When the 20 years of subsidised fee for the German turbine runs out it's done. No more money sell4scrap get rid of chemical waste gear/hydroulic oil shred the blades (those are nasty toxic waste) and if possible don't remove the 6000m3 concrete fundament
8974 2018-07-20 18:31:34 Drink the olive oil first, be much easier to get rid of those burgers on the back end
8975 2018-07-20 18:31:32 And get an oil for your scalp aaaaa 
8976 2018-07-20 18:31:20 Really??? This helps out a lot for me, but I am trying to find another moisturizer though. I see a lot of stuff about vitamin E oil.
8977 2018-07-20 18:31:08 FREE TICKET WINNER! Dalin Crowley has won two FREE tickets to tonight’s NOW600 Lucas Oil National Micro event at RPM Speedway in Crandall, Texas.
8978 2018-07-20 18:31:02 Nope.  Same reason I dont smoke.  I said brake pads b/c just like oil and energy it has a purpose and sometimes the best option without outlawing everything.  Especially when you make a comment on energy while using a electronic device that needs charging
8979 2018-07-20 18:30:59 That's the same year, your dad was polluting the environment with oil and a few years b4 the taxpayers paid to clean it up! Thanks Mike!!!
8980 2018-07-20 18:30:53 @Barclays #StopPipelines Tar sands are a climate disaster! The oil from tar sands is twice as carbon intensive as most crude oil, doing twice as much damage to our climate.
8981 2018-07-20 18:30:52 I need to do my cars oil change today
8982 2018-07-20 18:30:38 I finally have Castor Oil
8983 2018-07-20 18:30:35 Venezuela and oil?
8984 2018-07-20 18:30:33 SHELL OIL = BOOBS
8985 2018-07-20 18:30:29 Social safety net? You mean like letting people invest their own S.S. money? You always point to the small Nordic countries as success stories but never mention the easily accessible geothermal energy they have. Oil is their ‘play’ money.
8986 2018-07-20 18:30:25 IMHO: there is no sexual misconduct that could unseat Trump. Only if his base starts suffering economically will they react. Possibilities: cutting Soc Sec, raising age for Medicare, higher food and oil prices. If his base cared about sexual morals, Trump wouldn't be POTUS.
8987 2018-07-20 18:30:21 Stir one cup of Russian caviar with Corn fritters and sprinkle Sesame oil  on top. Pair with a crisp Huangjin Gui. Bon appétit!

8990 2018-07-20 18:29:48 Hotel key deactivated for the third time! They said it happens a lot because of cell phones, credit cards, sunlight, money, breathing, oil on skin, soooo everything you need and use for life basically.
8991 2018-07-20 18:29:37 Send me a pic of the tire tread.. on all 4..  RT @StfuAndListenHo: So i guess it’s oil change and car wash tomorrow
8992 2018-07-20 18:29:05 They r aren't they. Seen a few all seem 2 hv a lovely easy stride. Loving the oil drums! @CheltenhamRaces take note! #Upcycling!
8993 2018-07-20 18:29:02 Was super hyped to watch a movie while I waited for my oil change to be completed but then the connection ended up being shitty. On top of that, I’m starving and have yet to eat today. 

Almost there....
8994 2018-07-20 18:28:53 So i guess it’s oil change and car wash tomorrow
8995 2018-07-20 18:28:53 Yes. Because many people were cackling and rubbing their hands together creepily in the shadows at the thought of Tesla failing. Seriously, other than rivals and oil companies who did you think was hoping for that?
8996 2018-07-20 18:28:49 Really not looking forward to driving all the way to Bakersfield for an oil change
8997 2018-07-20 18:28:46 I am more of a technical analyst then fundamental analyst based on price action oil could see some pullback to the 60s but ultimately can go and test $100 within the next 12months. Mark this to see if I'm right; more then happy to have u comeback and call me an idot.
8998 2018-07-20 18:28:33 Opposition doesn’t make it wrong. The carbon tax offsets oil and gas subsidies already. I’m sick of welfare for corporations.
8999 2018-07-20 18:28:21 What  if they had put oil proceeds in a sovereign wealth fund from the beginning? Then distributed or spent the dividends sensibly.
9000 2018-07-20 18:28:21 Pura feku tha
Chasma utaro phir dekho yaro kitni hakikat kitna fasana
Ye patra ko ongc director bana diya hai
Tum chasma utar k dekho or sach bolo waha kiska operation kerna hai
Koi oil &gas ka experience wala sansad ya minister hota tou theek hai
Per patra gawar hai ongc k liye
9001 2018-07-20 18:28:14 Her got my oil changed for me! Im happy now :)
9002 2018-07-20 18:28:11 Bitch this website really scammed me with a face oil I’m upset 
9003 2018-07-20 18:27:48 これはスケベ…
9004 2018-07-20 18:27:45 Es cierto lo que dices. De lo bueno que puedes aprovechar al venir del sector petrolero o el oil and gas, es que te vuelves metódico y meticuloso, lo malo es cuando precisamente como dices, se quiere sobreponer el método de trabajo de pemex, en otro tipo de situación.
9005 2018-07-20 18:27:41 EOS’s

9010 2018-07-20 18:27:03 No doubt about that...Russian exports approximately $250 billion in crude and refined oil...by far it's leading export...
9011 2018-07-20 18:26:52 Really wish companies would stop putting coconut oil in EVERYthing. Everybody can't use it & there are so many other oils that can be used that are WAY better.
9012 2018-07-20 18:26:47 Yeah.... new tires and now got that oil change that was needed.  Wonder if I should hit the road lol

9014 2018-07-20 18:26:01 Or just over 4 cups of olive oil. It’s easier than it sounds.
9015 2018-07-20 18:25:47 I miss Lo's palm oil and groundnut oil stew with Kpanla fish. Maagawd
9016 2018-07-20 18:25:43 It would be great if all meat were humanly raised, but it really is expensive to buy all the time. Some day, hopefully...Is the o3 supplement above a brand you've tried +trusted? I was buying Carlson's finest fish oil, but even natural added flavorings aren't tolerated anymore.
9017 2018-07-20 18:25:40 “Mortal?” She stared at the woman she sort of considered a friend.

“I don’t know how that could be done. Unless the cure they were using years ago would work on him.

“But handcuffs and massage oil, that we could do.”

Death seemed so lonely. Pepper wished she could help.
9018 2018-07-20 18:25:26 Juss did a oil change on my grandmas car 
9019 2018-07-20 18:25:22 Organic farmers use fish emulsion for fertilizer and neem oil as a safe pesticide. If you keep your crop healthy by testing pH soil, water regularly and fertilize appropriately then you may get lucky and not get diseases. Organic farming is not easy. It takes a lot of knowledge.
9020 2018-07-20 18:25:12 Not BS Martin, have you spoke to any marine mammals about seismic blasting and do you keep standing next to a cellphone tower until the headaches get too bad? Show me proof (non oil industry source) it is not harming them please.

9022 2018-07-20 18:25:09 I used the sketchbook series from Moleskine. Surface primed with GAC 100. And those are Oil paints :) cheers!
9023 2018-07-20 18:25:09 I’m a little bit ridiculous. Plus, I knew I wouldn’t think if it again until my next oil change if I didn’t lol
9024 2018-07-20 18:24:59 I'd love to see that happen but our traitor Prez likes hanging with the oil burning dictators
9025 2018-07-20 18:24:57 As far as I know, there’s no palm oil in Oatly drinks, but rather in products that need some form of saturated, non-animal derived fat. Oatly has said they are trying to replace it whenever possible. They also only use sustainable palm oil.
9026 2018-07-20 18:24:56 somebody get my oil changed

9036 2018-07-20 18:23:57 I really wish I had! Or oiled it with the oil we use on our wooden worktop. But instead I varnished the top and now it's orange 
9037 2018-07-20 18:23:53 This is going to create warcry or chest thumping, oil crisis, warhead supremacy, wars inevitable ? More geographical posturing ?
9038 2018-07-20 18:23:43 2 tires , but i may be good with 1 and oil change.
9039 2018-07-20 18:23:42 This oil touching my soul
9040 2018-07-20 18:23:38 #thingsmissedduringmynap  I have no idea, but considering the fact that I woke up surrounded by bottles of baby oil, broom handles, crazy straws, glitter, rope, and an alpaca, I'm probably glad I slept through it.
9041 2018-07-20 18:23:29 We wouldn’t be using the TMX oil. It would be getting shipped to Asia. It doesn’t change our dependence on other countries. The project would create a lot of short term construction jobs but only 50 direct permanent jobs.
9042 2018-07-20 18:23:26 China has said they won’t stop buying Iranian oil. What would happen if the US sanctioned the PBoC? NEW #EconoGraphic  How Chinese retaliation could hurt the US and global economy

9045 2018-07-20 18:23:07 Would it over moisturize add more oils to hair after using products that contain oil? #NaturalHairTwitter
9046 2018-07-20 18:22:51 Cannabis oil is a broad term, cannabinoid content is imperative. CBD has shown efficacy in reducing epileptic seizures in kids. Long term effects of adolescent cannabinoid exposure are not fully understood, but for kids suffering dozens of seizures/day immediacy is highly valued
9047 2018-07-20 18:22:39 oil spills? knock it off
9048 2018-07-20 18:22:28 Money is all they care about, they now use palm oil , killing the orangutans but they don’t care about that as long as they make a nice big profit.
9049 2018-07-20 18:22:24 What caused the breakdown? Hope it wasn't anything embarrassing like no oil in the engine?

9060 2018-07-20 18:21:07 You sell the mining rights, the oil rights. You love nothing but money. So glad Pruitt is gone so we can focus on you. Get ready - it will be a crazy ride!
9061 2018-07-20 18:20:39 Valuable, like in oil money? Do not deal with Putin he is the antithesis of our national values.  Note maybe it's not to Trump's greed. but to our values. Trump has turned out to be the Swamp Monster.
9062 2018-07-20 18:20:34 I have a PERFECT right to be critical of US bombs killing people for oil. If you like that kind of thing, Sadness.

9067 2018-07-20 18:20:18 I bought mini packs with buddies a long time ago. I'm going to try to go to more oil kings games this year. I'll go to an Oilers game if there's signs of improvement.
9068 2018-07-20 18:20:06 Beverly Hills High School receives around $300,000 per year from a cluster of oil wells on campus.

9071 2018-07-20 18:19:44 Oil had to get one of his uncles down from the roof because he kept screaming and now he’s brushing him
9072 2018-07-20 18:19:31 Randy Orton uses baby oil too
9073 2018-07-20 18:19:25 Time to short oil (Always fade Marketwatch).
9074 2018-07-20 18:18:56 That said, Section 92 of the Constitution Act gives the provinces the exclusive jurisdiction over property and civil rights within their provinces. Oil is provincial property.  I think the Federal Liberals are in tough and it's a good investment to push them over the edge
9075 2018-07-20 18:18:54 Facts about how much oil DoD uses or the number of civilians killed in our operations aren’t opinions, though. And it’s absolutely dishonest for you to say so.
9076 2018-07-20 18:18:52 Wow some idiots in a hardcore crew did something violent over something trivial because they are too big of whiney babies to use their words like big adults? Well cover me with muscle oil and call me swol I am SHOCKED
9077 2018-07-20 18:18:49 @PowerLunch @MelissaLeeCNBC @MCaruso_Cabrera @steveliesman This is going to frustrate the hell out of #Trump, taking the #USD/$USD down, also likely to push #wti/#oil up, perhaps #inflation up, leading to #Fed hiking #rates higher, etc  ...LoL
9078 2018-07-20 18:18:46 @Wendys  I love your food except the fries. I like mcdonald's fries better but i want their fries recipe they use russet burbank potatoes and fry thrm in vegetable oil and a little bit of beef fat.
9079 2018-07-20 18:18:46 Every time I take my car for service they always try to scam me into fixing something that aint even broken like just change the oil so I can leave smh
9080 2018-07-20 18:18:43 @TheSciBabe How come everyone who claims their microwave and WiFi are giving them cancer uses coconut oil as sunscreen?
9081 2018-07-20 18:18:39 Random fact; thyme oil is an ingredient in mouthwash.
So next time you use mouthwash like listerine... you've got a bit of Thyme in you. >:3
9082 2018-07-20 18:18:36 Compare to Venezuela. Is oil the foundation of Venezuela's economy? Yes. Does Venezuela have prosperity? No. Would Venezuela have more prosperity without oil? We can't know, but probably.

Is oil "the foundation of Venezuela's prosperity"? I say no.
9083 2018-07-20 18:18:26 I came here to get my oil changed and that’s it !
9084 2018-07-20 18:18:26 Shrink acne by placing a wrapped ice cube on it and leave it on the pimple for 3 minutes. Then cover it with a dab of lavender oil.
9085 2018-07-20 18:18:16 The FDA has issues and I'm sure there are reasonable reforms, but certain recent news about a certain SV firm should show people the snake oil salesman aren't dead. They just have a new scam.
9086 2018-07-20 18:18:02 Want to oil up and slide between those amazing tits!!
9087 2018-07-20 18:18:01 You spent using oil money, we spent our own money after years of relatively frugal spending
9088 2018-07-20 18:17:52 Why not carve out the inside of each. Bottle of gun oil in one and butt plug in the other
9089 2018-07-20 18:17:46 That’s a lot of oil changes

9091 2018-07-20 18:17:36 Remember when #NATO aircraft (Yep, German Luftwaffe again) slaughtered over 80 innocent civilians in #Afghanistan who were trying to get fuel off a stranded oil tanker? Even #Merkel was appalled and ordered an inquiry but no use... still at it.
9092 2018-07-20 18:17:34 An oil change takes forever and a day smh
9093 2018-07-20 18:17:20 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for locally produced juice, and put some benzene essential oil in my diffuser.
9094 2018-07-20 18:17:18 Let me get the baby oil again lol
9095 2018-07-20 18:17:03 My dad changes my oil lol
9096 2018-07-20 18:16:59 Doing adult stuff like getting an oil change and getting new tires makes you feel so relieved and rewarding once it’s taken care of. Like yay I’m doing this, I’m a big girl. I don’t need my mama.
9097 2018-07-20 18:16:56 Watch that hand. She's short and you are very close to a grab.
9098 2018-07-20 18:16:48 Glycolic acid, vitamin c, AHA/BHA, and marula oil coming atcha girl. The one thing I will probably stick to with Drunk Elephant is the babyface peel. It's so, so good, and it doesn't leave my face bright red and weird.
9099 2018-07-20 18:16:45 Well, you can wet your fingers and flick water into the pan. If it sizzles, it's hot enough. :) Same thing with oil! #oldschool #Imnotagreatcook

9106 2018-07-20 18:16:16 my car leaks oil like crazy so I constantly am checking it. and 9/10 times a guy walks over to me asking if I need help and it’s actually quite annoying.
9107 2018-07-20 18:16:11 No. Let’s vote for the party that gave us provincial autonomy. Then established 8 new universities with multiple campuses. Established KP Oil & Gas authority. Worked for industries. Strengthening PDMA. Royalties. Mega infrastructure projects. Without foreign aid.
9108 2018-07-20 18:16:10 I need handcuffs, rings, vibes, oil, maybe some strawberries and the whips.

9112 2018-07-20 18:15:58 I'm looking forward to the History Channel's new show, "Oil Patch Justice"
9113 2018-07-20 18:15:54 U r talking almost all of  Fox's + others talking points . Took Russia a long time to concede to deal + that was only when Oil + other negs to their benefit were withdrawn. Now US withdraw,  serves  both China+ Russia.  Politically, it destabilizes NATO. Economically it's evident
9114 2018-07-20 18:15:52 So I thought I was a badass not using a measuring spoon while making my bulletproof coffee & I think I put too much MCT oil now my tummy hurts 
9115 2018-07-20 18:15:48 Cool. I do oil painting too. Really fun.
9116 2018-07-20 18:15:44 Tried a penetrating oil? Though I guess that'd only be applicable if there's corrosion or something.
9117 2018-07-20 18:15:33 .. and Adrian has posted that SS says his big pump can bang out over 500bopd! 
Get ready for the earth to shake! #UKOG #HORSEHILL
9118 2018-07-20 18:15:31  I've never asked for it, so only guessing. Wouldn't know what to ask for? The bits floating in the oil?

9121 2018-07-20 18:15:18 Yes, I do have #AppsurdCats who are rescues. Sphynx cats love human companionship. Their breed is described as monkey, dog & child. Think about that. They need a bath every week because no fur to absorb oil. They need human, blanket, heating pad windowsill Cat TV is a bonus.
9122 2018-07-20 18:15:14 Vested interested that control and profit from OIL will not shrink away quietly. There power will be used to thwart innovation, research and support, slowing progress to expand alt energy. Koch Bros. for example.
9123 2018-07-20 18:15:04 Oil change, full tank off gas, haircut, new Juul pod life’s good
9124 2018-07-20 18:15:01 Trump last week: oil is too high

Trump this week: the dollar is too high

Can’t make this shit up. 

Perhaps I am incorrectly assuming the POTUS knows there is correlation.
9125 2018-07-20 18:14:49 We have oil. 
Still like a country that just suffered civil war. 
Is corruption and lawlessness not worst than civil war. It has raped Nigerians from what they enjoy.
9126 2018-07-20 18:14:34 Next time try to put some oil on them and in the oven, better
9127 2018-07-20 18:14:18 Back when I was a kid if you had anything wrong with you it was castor oil and a mustard plaster or Vick’s and a wool sock around your neck, that may be what will work best for you ...
9128 2018-07-20 18:14:16 Shocked to read about the changes #aptamil have made to their formula and just want to scream from the rooftops for families to try #kendamil.Made in the English Lake District and full of whole milk. There are no nasties such as palm oil and it's also under £10 for 900g.
9129 2018-07-20 18:14:08 We are expecting only 6 months of oil sanctions to be done properly, the regime's mercenaries will not be repaid, they will not crush people.
9130 2018-07-20 18:14:00 @cnbc $XOM MktCap $345B at $70 oil & $3 Nat Gas Company >>>Asset Value: $790B ....not even taking into account the Massive World Refinery Capacity of 4.9M Bbls/day from 22 refineries in 14 countries...Earnings should be a beat too...
9131 2018-07-20 18:13:32 Yea I live in Canada and there are a lot of oil sand jobs in Edmonton and they're really good paying.
9132 2018-07-20 18:13:27 @cancertutor you are cancer. Your snake oil will kill desperate people.
9133 2018-07-20 18:13:25 I wonder if dawn puts a duckling in a puddle of oil for the sake of filming their commercial....rude
9134 2018-07-20 18:13:22 I never believed Nigeria was hard until I saw my friend eating bread  and anointing oil
9135 2018-07-20 18:13:22 Is Twitter invited to the wedding?! At least let us savages at the reception!
9136 2018-07-20 18:13:14 "Could you make Wade mortal? If not maybe some massage oil and handcuffs." 

Awkward silence. Deadly almost.
9137 2018-07-20 18:13:11 Though the extent of such things is likely exaggerated (undercut wages, that is) remain sold nothing more than staying the same to people who have had such a bad decade that even an obviously snake oil "change" beat that.

We need a vision for better, not the same.
9138 2018-07-20 18:13:05 Will CO2 tax make ANY diff  to world GHG balances? No, it won't. Will it have ANY measurable impact on world climate? No, it won't. It's a feel-good, boy scout tax that injures $35 Billion in oil exports, lets oil imports off the hook + lets USA consume our oil with NO penalty.
9139 2018-07-20 18:13:03 sure does...  oil share bid this week for whatever reason.  Its just been flatlined all week while soybeans are $.40 off the lows
9140 2018-07-20 18:12:56 The Scottish economy isn't based on very much these days. Tourism followed by oil, and renting out land for wind farms.
9141 2018-07-20 18:12:53 My problem with these people isn't just that they pattern match instead of think things through via first principles, it's that they don't pattern match on pattern matching!

Drilling for oil will be fine, you worry too much! 
*BP oil spill happens.*
Oh who could have known?!
9142 2018-07-20 18:12:47 @realDonaldTrump Iran's oil should be zero by November Reach China believes that if it wants to circumvent the sanctions on oil, heavier tariffs will be imposed and his national interests will be severely damaged.
9143 2018-07-20 18:12:43 Now the difference from the products made here in the US, and those made in Europe, is that in Europe they don’t add all the extra bs that they add here. So no extra fillers, additives, or chemicals. Myroll is literally made up of olive oil (body breaks it down faster) and cbd
9144 2018-07-20 18:12:39 @ToyotaCanada we bought a 2011 corolla 7 years ago and went through inspection the 7th time in a row and didnt need any work other then breaks tires or oil over the years. That's quality!!!

9147 2018-07-20 18:12:06 Home teams are obligated to wear the lighter colour. City Oil were culprits for coming in dark colours i guess

'OPEC is selling oil for over $135.00 a barrel.
 OPEC nations buy U.S. grain at $7.00 a bushel.
Solution: Sell grain for $135.00 a bushel.
 Can't buy it...Tough...Eat your damn oil.'
9149 2018-07-20 18:11:54 WHY YOU NEVER TELL ME? I blame you for soggy fries and oil on my cabinets tryna get crispy chicken wings.
9150 2018-07-20 18:11:53 Snakeoil salesman preying on people at their most vulnerable. Disgusting. The only alternative treatment I'd give a try, in conjunction with conventional medicine, is cannabis oil once it gets the nod for medical use.
9151 2018-07-20 18:11:52 $ELTZ $BIOAQ time to load the trains, about to leave the station. Major run on the way #oil #biotech #invest #pennyStocks
9152 2018-07-20 18:11:50 Her hair is so fine, all I use is water and hair shine. The olive oil brand.
9153 2018-07-20 18:11:43 coconut oil is great for scars!!!
9154 2018-07-20 18:11:37 دخلت العيادة وموظفة الاستقبال اللي هي ممرضة كمان قالتلي "hold on for a minute “وأسمعها تتكلم بالتلفون تقول cookies the red box not the blue one and olive oil apple,,,,قاعدة تعمل لستة المقاضي !! نعم !! حتى الأمريكان 
9155 2018-07-20 18:11:31 Without lobbying vs renewable energy for last 2 decades from oil exporting countries (cf Saudi position on Kyoto & various COP) + sanctions stoping RE initiatives in Iran, region could have been leader already. But changes came fortunately recently, especially with support of UAE
9156 2018-07-20 18:11:28 And when oil price was $100/barrel what did they do? Looting spree
9157 2018-07-20 18:11:26 Can you fry chips in CBD Oil?  Asking for a friend.  
9158 2018-07-20 18:11:19 Going to my friends tonight
Monday - going to side walk Sunday school 
Tuesday- going vbs in diamond park 
Wednesday -wagon trails cfc
Thursday - Sunday oil city pa
9159 2018-07-20 18:11:19 Oh noes oil clouds!!
9160 2018-07-20 18:11:18 I mix sea salt, coconut oil and lime essential oil ('cause you put the lime in the coconut), and leave it on the kitchen sink. I use it anytime I've been chopping or roast chiles ('cause NM) or cook with things that stink up your hands. Use it like soap. Also, kitchen gloves.
9161 2018-07-20 18:11:12 That's the second job posting I've seen today that says candidates must be 'happy to burn the midnight oil'. So much for flexible working opportunities for the 92% of millennials who want them!
9162 2018-07-20 18:11:11 I’m sitting in the lobby of the car place waiting for an oil change. Two other people here, very thin and fit, are eating fast food. I packed a lunch, yogurt, apple, & a Kashi bar. They look much better than I do. #frustrating #notfair
9163 2018-07-20 18:11:07 Baker Hughes oil rigs 858, down 5 on the week
9164 2018-07-20 18:10:58 This oil change shit taking 1 hunnit years smh
9165 2018-07-20 18:10:48 Big difference between diversifying energy production vs oil industry phase out. I’m certain they also vary greatly on their definitions of ‘slowly’
9166 2018-07-20 18:10:38 Oil to break down the makeup + a wet wipe
9167 2018-07-20 18:10:33 Trumpino, you can't have both; low oil prices and weak USD...Thanks for the Euro short opportunity though;) US final stand,  #financialwarfare loading...
9168 2018-07-20 18:10:33 i think my goal in life is to be taken seriously in a crop top. specifically by the guy in a mechanic shop who tells me about the mandatory repairs i should pay for along with my oil change.
9169 2018-07-20 18:10:27 Gotta get my oil changed in the Morning
9170 2018-07-20 18:10:19 My tire pressure light came on.  I used my tire pressure gauge to check my tires and put air in them.  I also know how to check my oil and washer fluid.     I’m a triple threat- what can I say. 
9171 2018-07-20 18:09:51 Also China and Russia now trading oil in yuan and rubles. India in Rupees.

#PetroDollar no longer the global currency, so that has to effect valuation, yes?
9172 2018-07-20 18:09:33 ฝันดีจ้า G9
9173 2018-07-20 18:09:31 Bmw cut my blower motor cable when i took it in for a FREE oil change. They told me it broke and wanted to charge me. So I have no ac in TX
9174 2018-07-20 18:09:19 Shut the fuck up. You aren’t a “selling club” because your owners make billions a year in oil. And considering our team is better without Coutinho I can’t be arsed that we sold him
9175 2018-07-20 18:09:18 "It doesn’t seem very RPW." Well you're wrong! ;) The oil of exorcism was "The Apostolic Tradition" and was practiced by all the church prior to Hippolytus. #BringBackAnointingOilsToBaptisms
9176 2018-07-20 18:09:13 i also have a cbd oil spray that i use before bed just to chill out a little bit and it kinda helps to just slow things down but it doesn't necessarily make me super drowsy
9177 2018-07-20 18:09:05 Try Kendamil. My nephew switched to it and is absolutely thriving. It's full of creamy whole milk and there's no nasties like palm oil. He is 2 and a half now and has such a good appetite. We put it down to Kendamil giving him such a good start in life #kendamil
9178 2018-07-20 18:08:53 นอนๆ ฝันดีออย
9179 2018-07-20 18:08:43 Evidence backs this, altho I'm sure they are aware of their vulnerability. It would be reasonable to assume the lead oil countries are looking at how to diversify.
9180 2018-07-20 18:08:31 อยากได้แฟ้มมม อุตส่าห์เตรียมตังค์รอเลยย
9181 2018-07-20 18:08:28 Complete disagree- taking over traditionally private sector activity such as oil and gas for purposes of subsidizing the cost of living for citizens is not a capitalist impulse or activity. It is engaging in helicopter money behind a pure socialist agenda via  Petroleous.
9182 2018-07-20 18:08:27 i found tea tree oil works better than rosehip for acne / scarring but rosehip is lovely for moisture for sure
9183 2018-07-20 18:08:12 used a hair/body oil on dry skin (I should stress it's really nice) but the problem is I keep getting whiffs of coconut.  not quite blegh but not really pleasant.
9184 2018-07-20 18:08:12 กำลังจะปิดโหมดเครื่องบินละพี่ง่วง
9185 2018-07-20 18:08:11 Oh, Please. It's an oil rich country typical of the many countries the UK should not be giving aid to when we have poverty at home.
9186 2018-07-20 18:07:51 Loggers, oil industry, industrial agriculture.
9187 2018-07-20 18:07:44 Your anointing isn't measured by how much oil a vessel holds -but how much it pours on others.
9188 2018-07-20 18:07:43 "you take my favorite photos and you don't make me get naked and cover myself in coconut oil"

one of my favorite things I've heard from a model
9189 2018-07-20 18:07:29 I’m getting my car serviced/oil change and the guy sees my Kirby lanyard and video game & anime keychains, and he’s lk “aye an anime fan, huh?” I’m lk ...yeah haha :-)
9190 2018-07-20 18:07:29 Hi! I just signed The Kodiak Bear! Oil on stretched canvas.
#kodiakbearpainting #autograph
9191 2018-07-20 18:07:28 In 1975 I first moved to Greeley,
I was stunned to hear people refer to the city name as Greedy Colorado. As I look at the city now, 
The coming of Oil and Grass have turned the City into just that. Inflation with a large element of
Outright personal inflated greed.
9192 2018-07-20 18:07:18 A good steak is seasoned with salt and pepper and maybe some butter or olive oil and that’s ALL it needs tbh. Ranch on steak is just a new level of niggatry.
9193 2018-07-20 18:07:11 Have you heard of Kendamil? It's made in the UK and is under £10 for 900g. My nephew has had it since birth and he is absolutely thriving. There's no nasties like palm oil and it's so creamy, made with whole milk!
9194 2018-07-20 18:07:07 [cw food] ofc! i’m admittedly using a mix. 1 cup gluten free bisquick mix, 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, 1 cup water, 1/4 cup applesauce (not entirely low fodmap but it’s my least sensitive of the four categories and a small amount)
9195 2018-07-20 18:07:05 @cnbc does power lunch think it's patriotic to allow diabetes to be freely sold and consumed? Subsidizing giant corporate Farms making high fructose corn syrup and hydrogenated vegetable oil Brilliant!
9196 2018-07-20 18:06:59 bought an industrial sized tub of peanut butter that is free from palm oil. In retrospect, what nuts are not markedly improved when served lubricated with oil?
9197 2018-07-20 18:06:57 Eh I just use cvs or whatever mineral oil.  Or this Howard’s butcher block conditioner from Amazon that’s got food grade mineral oil, vitamin E, beeswax and carnauba wax. Jojoba is for rich people 
9198 2018-07-20 18:06:47 Nice spin with 'guy who made his fortune in Russian oil'

The company is Access Industries, an investment firm headquartered in NYC and founded by a Ukrainian immigrant, Len Blavatnik. He created the company while still in school at Harvard. Sounds like the American dream to me
9199 2018-07-20 18:06:40 Pm kp oil is playing with life of people of Nepal. If he really think that the Nepal medical sectors are good then why he go to another country for check up ? There should be band to go abroad check up for every politician .
9200 2018-07-20 18:06:37 Erm well small gene pool, palm oil plantations create mono cultures, and changes in abiotic factors impacts it ALOT

9202 2018-07-20 18:06:33 He’s one of the largest investors in oil, railroad, gas, coal, and industrial metals yet his democrat fan base think he’s an enviormentalist 
9203 2018-07-20 18:06:28 This beard oil, na scam or real?
9204 2018-07-20 18:06:18 130 Crores Indians have burnt midnight oil to see live #surgicalstrike carried out by PM @narendramodi Ji on the Opposition on the floor of LokSabha. PM further warned the OP don’t look to Right side in Parliament in 2019 they may try their luck in 2024. #ModiTrustVote
9205 2018-07-20 18:06:09 $fdx Under 200ema. 30ema crossing below 200ema. Higher oil prices. Amazon shipping packages-competition fierce. Lower prices coming.
9206 2018-07-20 18:06:08 and all kinds of pencil syempre yung makapal to manipis. all kinds of ballpen too like yung watercolor na ballpen at color pencil pinaka magandang color pencil ay prisma at ang 150 colors ang malapit na sa 5k pati oil pastel
9207 2018-07-20 18:05:52 Try Kendamil! It's full of whole milk and no palm oil. My nephew has it and he is absolutely thriving! Aptamil have a lot to answer!!!!
9208 2018-07-20 18:05:37 One of these guys commenting is pretty successful in the oil and gas industry; I think he's on the other side of the equation and so his interest does lie with the boss. But you see this so damn often from fans who aren't.
9209 2018-07-20 18:05:36 Currently getting my oil changed and I desperately want to be napping right now

9212 2018-07-20 18:05:21 Of course tRUmp has an agenda. His agenda includes removal of sanctions against Russia, allowing a referendum on Ukraine annexation, more oil Pipelines for Gazprom, chaos and disorder for NATO--all things coincidentally aligned with--surprise--Putin.
9213 2018-07-20 18:05:02 I need to get a oil change tomorrow..
9214 2018-07-20 18:04:54 that does sound fantastic. throw in some olive oil & that's how i saute mushrooms
9215 2018-07-20 18:04:45 Try Kendamil! I am shocked to read how many innocent babies are unwell due to this. Kendamil is made with no palm oil and whole milk. It's really good stuff!!! #kendamil
9216 2018-07-20 18:04:41 For sure! Their religion out plays actual scientific facts, bc they’re “in it for money”. When in actuality the scientists that work for the coal/oil companies are the scientists “in it for the money”.
They believe bs over actual scientific evidence.  It’s sad.
9217 2018-07-20 18:04:35 We found an ancient Egyptian granite sarcophagus in Alexandria with three skeletons and sewage water inside. 
A statue of the Virigin Mary is weeping Olive Oil and we can’t explain it. 

2018 is a year of eerie archeological and Art History finds my dudes.
9218 2018-07-20 18:04:13 WTF of the day: a clothes rack, like from a closet, stuck in a car’s oil pan.
9219 2018-07-20 18:03:51 Koch & friends are running this gov asap while DT serves Putin as well as he can?  DT agreed to serve Kochs & Putin as they prepare to serve oil increasing their fortunes to China?
9220 2018-07-20 18:03:50 A Hater be calling my French Vanilla creamer in my coffee “milkshakes”  but they just mad my coffee tastes better than that car engine motor oil they be making. 
9221 2018-07-20 18:03:43 improvise　vt, vi. （詩・音楽など）即興で作る・演奏する

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
9222 2018-07-20 18:03:41 I need a hot oil, hot rocks, deep tissue, FULL BODY MASSAGE!!! 
9223 2018-07-20 18:03:29 Chelsea and City are worth a shit without oil money - and oil isn't getting more. Just saying. United are a flop since Ferguson left. Happens when you depend on one person to carry you. Bayern would piss over PL and win it every year like City won it last season.
9224 2018-07-20 18:03:18 haha #oil > $120 pre 2019 dont listen to #goldmansachs so much ;)
#oott
9225 2018-07-20 18:03:16 No reason to kiss up. Russia is a tiny economy. It has nukes and oil. Not much else. We want a president to stand up publicly especially when there is growing evidence the GOP was compromised to some degree by Russian agents. -
Trying to be reasonable.
9226 2018-07-20 18:03:13 Take it back and buy some Kendamil from Amazon or direct from their website. There are no nasties like palm oil and it's made with whole milk!
9227 2018-07-20 18:03:12 んんん…良きだったε≡(*ﾉ`>ω<´)ﾉ
9228 2018-07-20 18:03:05 Stop the British and Americans from looting mineral (Oil,Gold,Uranium & Graphene) from other countries under the pretext of war on terror and implementation of democracy.

9231 2018-07-20 18:02:25 Tea tree oil is the best thing for pimples
9232 2018-07-20 18:02:21 I really hate that these men feel the need to say “imma truck driver” or “I’m in the oil field” like niggah that’s not my first thought when it comes to men
9233 2018-07-20 18:01:37 What they have done is disgusting? Do they not test their product? My nephew has Kendamil. A UK made formula which has no palm oil and it's made with whole milk. #aptamil deserves to be fined a hefty sum to stop them from ever letting this happen to innocent babies again!!!
9234 2018-07-20 18:01:31 I’m one of those people that put off oil changes until 1,000s of miles overdue – bij Jiffy Lube
9235 2018-07-20 18:01:30 At 2:00pm I got a correlation buy signal for the Crude Oil WTI Futures (CLU18) and USO on my software.
9236 2018-07-20 18:01:28 Because.. by doing this, he can drill for oil in places he normally wouldn't be able to. By changing the endangered lists, there's no need to keep their habitats "protected" and these assholes can move in. Thus more money in his shareholder pocket.
9237 2018-07-20 18:01:26 At this point both reasons are valid because I don’t see Libyan politicians are really thinking abt their country or people or else things wouldn’t have got this worse only Mr.Mustafa Sanalah is working to keep the oil flowing
9238 2018-07-20 18:01:23 Lol throw some canola oil on it and you’ll be okay
9239 2018-07-20 18:01:14 Setting up for night one of the @WorldofOutlaws @craftsman Sprint Car Series Champion Oil #SummerNationals at @WilliamsGrove.  It's round two of the #Outlaws vs the #Posse!
9240 2018-07-20 18:01:01 It has everything to do with @JustinTrudeau and his lack of leadership.  Energy East was bad, but Transmountain had gone through every step required and he let a bunch of enviro-Nazis derail the project. He also commented on shutting down the oil industry previously.
9241 2018-07-20 18:00:53 Sadly @WolfForPA is just as in bed with the oil and gas industry. Either way, Pennsylvanians will be losing this November when it comes to this topic.
9242 2018-07-20 18:00:41 What about olive oil My GOOD POTUS ? The only tree that grows in the Negev desert ,Simpson , ( I bet u don’t no where it is ) Sahara , ( khadafi is buried there ) and Lebanon ! Now in that part of the world , we have (no no , no pork )and 
9243 2018-07-20 18:00:35 I use mineral oil !  Much cheaper and gets the same job done. I order off amazon.
9244 2018-07-20 18:00:34 Amir Fakhravar is an insult to snake oil salesmen all over the world.
9245 2018-07-20 18:00:23 Did Patrick mention Iran sits on $45 Trillion in oil reserves?
As if America really cares about others freedoms.
9246 2018-07-20 18:00:09 My favorite part about getting my oil changed is when they ask me questions like “what kind of oil was last used in your car” or “what psi do you want your tires at” and I just stare at them blankly
9247 2018-07-20 18:00:05 Abi coconut oil
9248 2018-07-20 17:59:50 Try your baby on Kendamil. It's made with no palm oil and whole milk. It's so creamy and full of goodness. My nephew loves it! X
9249 2018-07-20 17:59:41 Retweeted Lawrence Moore (@TheRealRazielah):

@realDonaldTrump They are stealing the economic increase.... Oil price fixing and Bank lending scam...  Nothing left for the people...
9250 2018-07-20 17:59:40 Adulting is expensive and it's not fun. I mean, I spent $600+ on new tires and an oil change, and I can't even wear them.
9251 2018-07-20 17:59:36 They are stealing the economic increase.... Oil price fixing and Bank lending scam...  Nothing left for the people...
9252 2018-07-20 17:59:35 Always been suspicious of newscasters with body oil.
9253 2018-07-20 17:59:09 They also import the vast majority of their oil. None of the countries that supply them have carbon taxation and many have morally reprehensible regimes and customs. 

I’m sure the average Quebecer is well aware of this.
9254 2018-07-20 17:59:09 Congratulations to #california where your governer #jerry just passed a bill to make CBD oil FDA approved to use and through pharm only. Keep the stupidity flowing #plasticcalifornia #fakepeople #democratshateyou #commiecali #moonbeam #toostonedtonotice #cluelessinLA
9255 2018-07-20 17:58:55 If the time machine is reusable & programmable then that, obviously. Sitter' Mill, then buy all the oil fields, quick stop to build wells, then home for dinner.
9256 2018-07-20 17:58:52 I think this guy don't know what he is saying. So,  @RotimiAmaechi and Adams Osomale were @OfficialPDPNig members that took FG under @GEJonathan to court to share excel crude oil money and call it illegal. Most of @APCNigeria supporters are "mumu"
9257 2018-07-20 17:58:41 Have you tried Kendamil? It's sold on Amazon. It's made in the UK and most of the supermarkets are stockong it in some stores. It's about to take off! No palm oil and made with whole milk. My nephew loves it!
9258 2018-07-20 17:58:34 Do you tip when you get your oil changed

9262 2018-07-20 17:57:40 Could have fooled me, looks like just as bad a failure as all other socialist "experiments.".... Except the ones in oil rich countries...
9263 2018-07-20 17:57:37 Okay so I have the lip whip remover, now what color #lipwhip should I get? I love a good pinkie nude or red/burgundy but can’t decide @beautybakerie y’all killed that remover btw. Usually I use solid to oil type but your pads are amazingly hydrating
9264 2018-07-20 17:57:31 Please Mr Harper please tell us of your experience handling hostile negotiations with the US over NAFTA...oh that's right you never had to do anything about it.  In fact you did pitiful little about trade except pray that the price of oil stay high
9265 2018-07-20 17:57:28 Have you tried Kendamil? It's made in the UK and full of goodness. No palm oil and made with whole milk. My nephew Reuben loves it!
9266 2018-07-20 17:57:26 Spending our money too, not debt or stolen oil money or the sweat off human rights abuses.
9267 2018-07-20 17:57:24 Lol. Did you read this? There was a drop in oil prices, because of capitalism and it's inner workings, that has created the majority of their burdens. Why not point to Cuba where everyone is literate, unlike the is, has food and free healthcare? Those are the effects of socialism
9268 2018-07-20 17:57:19 A wash of colour suspended in a nourishing lip oil is our favourite way to keep our lips hydrayed when the temperature's rising. Try: Clarins Water Lip Stain from @ShopprsDrugMart  today! #yyc #wbm #everydayessentials

9271 2018-07-20 17:57:01 the refinery is 23,000 bpd, produces a lot of lube oil and diesel
9272 2018-07-20 17:56:58 @knfilters I've been using your filters my whole life. Just got my first Volkswagen diesel. I was disappointed to find out you guys don't make paper filters. What's the reason do not produce paper oil filters?
9273 2018-07-20 17:56:51 Spending money earned legitimately by player trading & reaching Champions league final, unlike City, unsustainably spending oil money not earned by the Club, cheating Financial Fair play.
9274 2018-07-20 17:56:42 You are trying to use the Scandinavian countries as a example but they are cutting back their social programs because they can't afford them and that's with massive oil reserves the fund over 40% of their social programs and not having to have a real defense budget.
9275 2018-07-20 17:56:38 I don't blame anyone who gets this wrong, but you know someone knows what they're talking about in oil/gas if they pronounce "Schlumberger" correctly.
9276 2018-07-20 17:56:34 Attempting. Whether or not I was actually funny is, I suppose, a matter for debate. My target for mockery was Hippolytus, not RSC. I don’t recall him teaching anything about oil of exorcism. It doesn’t seem very RPW.
9277 2018-07-20 17:56:34 "You know, Darren, if you had told me twenty-five years ago that some day I'd be standing here about to solve the world's energy problems, I would've said you were crazy. Now let's push this giant ball of oil out this window."
9278 2018-07-20 17:56:32 An Edible, THC vape oil and a pipe after work...I am really fucking high right now.
9279 2018-07-20 17:56:24 Have you tried Kendamil? My nephew is thriving from it. No palm oil and it's made with whole milk. It's really tasty and it's made in the English Lakes #kendamil
9280 2018-07-20 17:56:02 And a barrel of oil is $100 cheaper than the last time gas was in this range. Gas companies are going to have record profits yet again, and they'll have to raise the price to top this year.
9281 2018-07-20 17:55:45 "Lead them from temptation, make them royalty
All the things we're facin' makes us question it
Lead us to salvation, pour that oil please
That's how we become kings and queens".

9282 2018-07-20 17:55:35 I need that job where I wash off corporate oil from baby ducks with Dawn soap. Lmk @SCJohnson when there's an opening
9283 2018-07-20 17:55:32 And it gets mighty irritating having to clean bike oil or tire marks from clothing.
9284 2018-07-20 17:55:32 it’ll be back soon. I just have to get more lemon oil!
9285 2018-07-20 17:55:30 Waiting to get my oil changed is literally one of my least favorite things to do.
9286 2018-07-20 17:55:30 If you do work more than regular 9 hours, any extra hour should be double paid. In the oil field, we have a daily rate with a particular coefficient 
9287 2018-07-20 17:55:27 Have you tried Kendamil? It's made in the UK at under £10 for 900g. It's got no nasties - no palm oil and made with whole milk. My nephew has thrived on it! X
9288 2018-07-20 17:55:25 I need like 2 sativa blunts after work and a new oil lmao.
9289 2018-07-20 17:55:20 Anything instead of mayo will be gross. Trust me. Try a mayo made with olive oil if you’re trying to be healthy. Same good fats as avocados, use less of it and season the tuna with lemon, salt, pepper and my secret... old bay. It’s takes tuna to the next level!!!
9290 2018-07-20 17:55:19 Are you still selling that snake oil?  It didn’t work for me, but I have family members that will buy some. I know what they think. Thanks for the free sample.
9291 2018-07-20 17:55:18 Press it, cut into triangles of desired thickness then marinade in (jar) jerk seasoning with a little oil and soy, then bake or fry. Simple, quick, great with like brown rice and kale.
9292 2018-07-20 17:55:11 We roam ahead and turn out of where you see
I can’t hear the heart, this old oil stain
9293 2018-07-20 17:54:56 Got A $10 Discount On My Oil Change 
9294 2018-07-20 17:54:56 "I love your skin! What do you use to moisturize, oil of Olay?"
"Tongue of dog"
9295 2018-07-20 17:54:53 Just want my oil changed and they pressuring me to get all this extra shit done to my car while I’m here
9296 2018-07-20 17:54:47 Hey. I just got out of an oil change/tire rotation. Only free this was some burnt coffee and styrofoam cups
9297 2018-07-20 17:54:38 Whatever we do, we need to do better and there has never been a better time to do things better.What got us into this ecological disaster in the first place? an industrial revolution? the age of oil? oil, coal, gas are all too easy. Time to challenge ourselves #green_technology
9298 2018-07-20 17:54:24 Shocking.. I mean I'm no oil painting but against him I feel like brad Pitt lol
9299 2018-07-20 17:54:16 Just dont use baby oil, Ill allergic to that crap.  See u soon 
9300 2018-07-20 17:54:12 explaining they're working to find alternatives. Conversations were amicable +it appears they weren't aware of their palm oil use. I had hoped that misleading Palm Oil Free logos + other P.O Free advertising would be removed but at least they say they are now working on the issue
9301 2018-07-20 17:54:11 Have you ever heard of Kendamil? It's made in the UK and my nephew Reuben is thriving from it. There's no palm oil and it's made with whole milk. Couldn't recommend it more #kendamil #kendalnutricare #ditchaptamil
9302 2018-07-20 17:54:10 Perhaps I should post a photo of the oil sands? Or Fort McMurray fires? It’s nature. It’s tragic for many. Please...stand with us. While I am at no risk. This is 10 miles from my house

9304 2018-07-20 17:53:18 Bros. Listen to what they are telling because u are ignorant on this. @RotimiAmaechi and Adams Osomale of Edo State was those that fronted and took FG to court to call excel crude oil account illegal before FG Now shared the money.
9305 2018-07-20 17:53:18 I forgot I wanted to buy perfume oil from bookie, now I ve used money to buy kulikuli 
9306 2018-07-20 17:53:07 Maybe if you had been honest with Canadians it wouldn't have come to this. We all know the carbon tax would have to be prohibitively expensive in order to force people to use less. Instead maybe we can focus on technology to wean ourselves from oil.
9307 2018-07-20 17:53:05 Is there a better feeling than driving after filling your tank & changing your own engine oil and washer fluid?
9308 2018-07-20 17:52:44 People have quit stopping at stop signs again...the oil boom must be coming back
9309 2018-07-20 17:52:41 Completely different, City have spent £2,000,000,000 on players that they didn't earn legitimately. Oil Money
Liverpool sold their best player for £150,000,000 , had spent a total of 20,000,000 net in 4 previous years. Reached a Champions league final & are spending money earned
9310 2018-07-20 17:52:31 Of course Dems wouldn’t “outlaw” oil companies but we would and should regulate the shit out of them, which is often inconsistent with taking their campaign $. I agree this is overblown here, except Brown comes out looking like a hypocrite.
9311 2018-07-20 17:52:23 Big Oil Firms Just Notched Another Victory Against Cities Suing Over Their Role in Climate Change - Fortune
9312 2018-07-20 17:52:20 So is it appropriate for dude at the oil change place pulling my truck into the bay to Vape in it???
9313 2018-07-20 17:52:10 I would love nothing more than to be the largest provider of oil and natural gas to Europe and watch Russia’s economy crumble.
9314 2018-07-20 17:51:59 Baker Hughes Rig Count: U.S. -8 to 1,046 rigs U.S. Rig Count is down 8 rigs from last week to 1,046, with oil down 5 to 858, gas rigs down 2 to 187, and miscellaneous rigs down 1 to 1.
9315 2018-07-20 17:51:52 If you look at a $1 bill closely, you’ll see it’s covered in reptiles!  Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
9316 2018-07-20 17:51:41 Dependent on oil? You noticed Saudi arabia at all?
9317 2018-07-20 17:51:32 i lowkey picked the wrong day and wrong time to go to nashville for my oil change. 
9318 2018-07-20 17:51:26 Those 2 are like oil & water.....,They just don't mix,and at the slightest disagreement will be a spark that turns into a .
9319 2018-07-20 17:51:20 Literally was going to change the oil in the Abarth, but the drain plug was a little stripped and on too tight. Dad says I should go to a shop to have them do it. I'm trying to save money by working on my own car, not spend more money
9320 2018-07-20 17:51:05 Do you put coconut oil in coffee?
9321 2018-07-20 17:50:54 We'll, sure, because *someone* forgot to cook it in olive oil and a handful of red pepper flakes. Cook on low until it falls apart.
9322 2018-07-20 17:50:54 vitamin c & rose hip oil!
9323 2018-07-20 17:50:45 always coconut oil!
9324 2018-07-20 17:50:44 I blame everything on the oil companies and the zionist
9325 2018-07-20 17:50:36 The fight is on from some oil down 
9326 2018-07-20 17:50:29 I’m not from the USA but to anyone I’d speak to they’d know Iraq was all about oil. How can admin officials openly use this as a pretext to go to war and not expect to lose their voter base?
9327 2018-07-20 17:50:21 Less than 1 week away from our valley party! Time to start rolling out some of the door prizes to be given away! Free oil change and free tire change over at Master Auto here in Wasilla! Who is going to win these?!?! Could be you! See you there in Thursday!
9328 2018-07-20 17:50:20 I had to get new tires an oil change pay my bills and rent
9329 2018-07-20 17:50:17 Higher Oil prices
9330 2018-07-20 17:50:09 mau nanya dong, pas abis pake cleansing oil dibilas dulu baru pake facial wash atau ditimpa? -ns
9331 2018-07-20 17:49:53 Antalet aktiva olje- och gasriggar i USA minskade med 8 denna veckan till 1 046 (årsskiftet 929), enligt Baker Hughes #OOTT #oil

9334 2018-07-20 17:49:35 John Grant and Collared Doves. Apple Groves huge view of the estuary. Cranes and oil refineries on the other side. Suburban sprawl on this side. Sparrows. Puddles! Hasn’t rained for weeks... more gulls
9335 2018-07-20 17:49:32 Ice cream, baby oil & strawberries 
9336 2018-07-20 17:49:32 Coconut oil solves everything  
9337 2018-07-20 17:49:28 We've had oil Riggs off coast of California for years. 
They are excellent wild life habitats 

Did you know?
A typical four-leg structure provides two to three acres of habitat for hundreds of marine species.
9338 2018-07-20 17:49:21 Again, we don’t need diplomatic success. We just need to contain and deter them. We are also too soft on NOKO presently. China and Russia are both shipping oil to that tyrannical regime. A full military blockade should prevent this from continuing.
9339 2018-07-20 17:49:17 Hey class of 2020! Just a reminder that tomorrow, July 21, we are having our car wash fundraiser for our junior year! Please make it a point to stop by, get your car washed and maybe even help out. It’s at Central Oil, can’t wait to see you!!!
9340 2018-07-20 17:49:09 Overthrowing Mossadegh was probably one of the worst ideas we ever executed, and all for the Brits and their need for oil. We should have cultivated him and the new democratic movement there.
9341 2018-07-20 17:49:05 НЕФТЬ - буровые Baker Hughes
Baker Hughes oil rigs 858, down 5 on the week
9342 2018-07-20 17:49:05 extroverted olive oil
9343 2018-07-20 17:49:03 Believe it or not but Wind power has killed more wildlife than every oil spill in the history of this planet. Wind power must be the biggest green scam ever. It’s the most mature energy source on the planet. It’s impossible to improve without upscaling them to insane sizes.
9344 2018-07-20 17:49:00 What are you working on an offshore oil rig now?!
9345 2018-07-20 17:48:43 I live right near that Busch Gardens. Great spot, expensive beer
9346 2018-07-20 17:48:35 #UK  govt once again shown its face like the imperialist it is.@hbaldwin  pretended she went to CameroUn to resolve the war against our people in #Ambazonia  only to come back and announce the dictator Biya sold them our oil field. We dont need ur aid. Just Stop arming dictators
9347 2018-07-20 17:48:31 why do ppl get mad at white girls for tanning..? its not cultural appropriation if all she’s doing is chilling in the sun and slathering on some spf oil. it’s literally just skin doing a sciencey thing. everyone’s skin does it. i don’t think science culturally appropriates.
9348 2018-07-20 17:48:07 @realDonaldTrump will you please give some information on when free energy technologies will be released to the public? We're tired of coal and oil
9349 2018-07-20 17:48:02 Just like a monorail project in one oil state
9350 2018-07-20 17:47:59 Peak Oil.
9351 2018-07-20 17:47:36 I strongly believe in local food systems, not controlled by globalised companies. From factory farmed pigs, fake meat from GMO processes, palm oil from felled rainforest to gmo Brazilian soya used to feed factory chickens. All need to be removed. 1/2
9352 2018-07-20 17:47:28 j*rking off with coconut oil is not the tea
9353 2018-07-20 17:47:26 Farooq A, killer butcher killed Hindus,exodus as CM,today sneaked to Parliment for 1 yr existence,shd see from eyes & be clear to answer almighty for Killing minority of state & answer what was their fault,shameless butcher get ready to reply/face hot oil which has to fall on u

9355 2018-07-20 17:47:25 Fresh cut, washed my whip and got an oil change. Happy Friday ya’ll
9356 2018-07-20 17:47:25 this the corsa? it's obvs got some other severe issue if it's pissing / burning oil that quickly if it was fine the other week
9357 2018-07-20 17:47:23 Just helped myself to a free cold bottled water like some big money pimp. Best oil change/tire rotation ever.
9358 2018-07-20 17:47:18 Hi! The floor is made with a type of South African wood, which is then painted black.. the bad news is that any oil interacts with the paint and can sometimes make the floor very slippy! But the wood is the best flooring for the sound of the taps and for the stage mechanics etc!
9359 2018-07-20 17:47:02 baby oil for tanning is GOD TIER if you’re smart about it
9360 2018-07-20 17:46:56 Peppermint oil

9364 2018-07-20 17:46:15 Ich weiß nicht, wie ich das auf Deutsch sagen soll, aber...

He's a creepy snake oil salesman. Would rather have that news coming from Bayern.
9365 2018-07-20 17:46:13 The Messiah is a perfect brother to all nations, giving to everyone unlimited oil of favor and wine of wisdom.
9366 2018-07-20 17:46:09 i feel like whoever made this says oil like OYE
9367 2018-07-20 17:45:41 From what I've read a lot of autistic people claim cannabis oil helps both their autism and epilepsy.
9368 2018-07-20 17:45:40 Money managers decreased bullish ICE Brent crude oil bets by 94,556 net-long positions to 353,245, weekly ICE Futures Europe data on futures and options show

9369 2018-07-20 17:45:30 One of the others is #SaudiArabia . They still do beheadings and the oil money funds more than terrorists.
9370 2018-07-20 17:45:16 You should create a business (if sanity ever prevails). Huge demand, in every industry, especially the oil industry.
9371 2018-07-20 17:45:03 Or when we have a commodities-centric economy again, based primarily on oil, once he's finished having Russia annex us, too.

9373 2018-07-20 17:44:55 gas price fluctuations, oil changes, typical interior design, Highly uninspiring. Same applies to air travel. Tesla Model 3 is going to a super hit cause it allows normal people to experience on a daily basis a new way of travelling. Its not about acceleration or level 5 autonomy
9374 2018-07-20 17:44:53 It is President Trump! President Trump never lifted any sanctions. After the President was elected the Russians sponsored 2 Anti Trump Rallies. That's what Mueller reported. America is now in a Golden Age. Best in 60 years. America now is a exporter in oil and gas.
9375 2018-07-20 17:44:47 Wood mate, the allcoat made it fairly easy compared to what the previous coats would have taken with oil!!
9376 2018-07-20 17:44:35 Haven’t seen it.  Will take your word for it.

9380 2018-07-20 17:44:09 Ted got us the truck we needed, quickly, under duress, at a very decent price. And now I'm getting my tire fixed for $35 and an oil change to boot. Not bad!
9381 2018-07-20 17:43:56 I'd say it's oil prices and extreme mismanagement, saying its socialism is a shallow excuse too
9382 2018-07-20 17:43:52 I am not happy c either NAFTA or TPP but Harper is a snake who will make things much worse. He is owned by big oil and is nothing more than a puppet. I loathe him
9383 2018-07-20 17:43:52 Westminster,tories and labour have taken 92% of scots oil revenues for 40+ years,
and have managed to near bankrupt that oil rich UK.
Scots want out cos we have had enough of being told we cant by those who take that 92%
9384 2018-07-20 17:43:50 Farming will be the modern day companies and make-up institutions and oil/gas etc.. my dear, even trees might not survive 
9385 2018-07-20 17:43:48 Twitter is so hard... To get followers is more difficult than drilling for oil or mining gold.
9386 2018-07-20 17:43:47 Btw doesn’t anyone wonder why Putin hates HRC so much...well he actually feared her bc she was tough and knew the chances for sanctions being lifted were zero..thus the campaign to elect his asset..Russia is a gas station with no shop ..gas/oil and bad economy
9387 2018-07-20 17:43:38 my grandma spends a $100 on CBD oil for my anxiety, bless that women
9388 2018-07-20 17:43:33 Beef oil? Idk McDonalds used to use that. And I really think that would depend on a person's preference, yknow? People might ne iffy about that

9397 2018-07-20 17:42:07 Truth be known this goes back to the great depression when all the gold was stolen thats from mine & Tamala and our brothers ancesters also the oil in Texas Bush yea they stole that from our great ancestors look at  Hardley Davison we can go on were sick of it
9398 2018-07-20 17:41:59 You understand that not oil is the same? There are light, intermediate and heavy grades, each grade is needed for different reasons, we sell our oil to someone that need our oil grades and in return we buy grades we need. Also, when did I mention anything about a supply shortage?

9403 2018-07-20 17:41:07 Why do Democrats demonize essential industries that employ thousands and drive the economy? It's not like they plan to actually outlaw oil companies if they get elected so why the charade? Lip service to Luddites? Can they be more cynical?

9408 2018-07-20 17:40:50 I rode an oil well and my drunk buddies scored me 90 am I officially a Kansan now???
9409 2018-07-20 17:40:43 We now why some politicians have no faith in EVM. They cannot operate it. They belong to the ballot paper era, the same time when there used to be long queues for kerosine oil and suger.
9410 2018-07-20 17:40:28 Well the US will help access the markets by leveraging oil prices to make the EU co operate. IT may piss off alot of countries but as long as they depend on oil and dispise russia they will eventually give in.
9411 2018-07-20 17:40:18 Trumps rhetoric with Putin is an easy story for the media because it happens in one day, but nobody talks about him atrophying russia’s oil exports to Europe for the past year.
9412 2018-07-20 17:40:09 Somebody come take my car to get an oil change.... Cuz I just can't 
9413 2018-07-20 17:40:08 猫だな
9414 2018-07-20 17:40:05 It looks very much like a power grab and consolidating his hold after oil price manipulation failed. The Prince's meddling in Yemen from the very beginning was blundering and callous. Women are allowed to drive but still controlled and imprisoned by an all powerful monolith state
9415 2018-07-20 17:40:04 Any countries willing to trade for oil??
9416 2018-07-20 17:40:00 Tuna packed in olive oil >>>>>>>>

9426 2018-07-20 17:39:18 Talk to obama boys about snake oil sales like the Obamacare con aka AHA for starters
9427 2018-07-20 17:39:14 Nothing is going to happen to Whoopi because we as a society have zero expectations of her if she had red hair frecles and was a man she would not be employed
9428 2018-07-20 17:39:08 I so much admire oil on canvas painting, hyper realistic one.
9429 2018-07-20 17:38:58 i really wanna be tan & glow, but dude it’s hot laying outside with oil on 
9430 2018-07-20 17:38:44 Another delivery done for @dejokecarew perfume oil by @Acedeliveryltd. Thanks for choosing us one more time
9431 2018-07-20 17:38:37 Venezuela has the largest oil reserves and the largest gold deposits in the world and it's people are starving. Something's way wrong with the left and socialism. We could end up like them if the left wins and takes over the US, because next time they won't let go.
9432 2018-07-20 17:38:28 Sera que tiene miedo a que le abra proceso por los negociados con Hunt Oil y Odebrecht? Con todas la evidencias que hay, PPK debería estar procesado en el PJ.
9433 2018-07-20 17:38:24 Arguments by those who hate fanny packs are as stupid as those against cargo pants. I'll wear what I want, when I want, and how I want to wear it. I don't know why people think their opinion even matters.

9436 2018-07-20 17:38:09 needed that sweet sweet oil
9437 2018-07-20 17:38:05 Only my second day in so a bit soon to know.  I’ve vaped CBD oil for a while and that definitely did help.  Not too keen on vaping long term though so trying oral CBD oil.
9438 2018-07-20 17:38:00 Hit my cbd oil like a hundred times and I’m still having a panic attack so what’s the tea
9439 2018-07-20 17:37:53 Trump won!  So they can do much more than just make Hillary's life a misery.  The sanctions must go; you can't drill for Arctic oil with Russian technology, and that's the ultimate goal of Kochs/Mercers/Putin.  Then it's time to destroy EU, NATO, NAFTA, TPP. Midterm elections /2
9440 2018-07-20 17:37:53 You only need coconut oil to make yo face clear
9441 2018-07-20 17:37:40 Oil overdue 
9442 2018-07-20 17:37:32 Okay okay, so all I’m saying it’s not really a step up, it they started buying their oil from the US that would be good since at least the US will make money of it.
9443 2018-07-20 17:37:28 In SouthAfrica they want to mine the sea for eg oil and gas! #OperationPhakisa

9455 2018-07-20 17:36:21 When I was at my old school, my teacher told us about this urban legend about an art teacher who told her students to go buy a big tube of expensive purple oil paint. When they brought it to class, she told them to squeeze out the entire tube and throw it out.
9456 2018-07-20 17:36:14 @jimrome Stevie just separated from group like oil from water #Smackoff

9458 2018-07-20 17:35:43 I once thought my wife was being unnecessarily cautious when we walked into a NY pizza place and she asked about peanuts and the pizza. Good thing she asked. They used peanut oil in the pizza. Lesson learned: You always have to ask, and then check again.
9459 2018-07-20 17:35:42 *matt opens my car door* 

I knew I smelled some essential oil crap in here
9460 2018-07-20 17:35:19 That's literally what happened to me with my first car 3 years ago. Fuck that place. Been doing my oil changes myself ever since.
9461 2018-07-20 17:35:17 It's time for that show to GO!
9462 2018-07-20 17:35:14 I bet for people saying 'animals are delicious' never tried meat by itself. Nope, they used plant based seasonings to make it taste good. Plant based. Plant. Not meat. Go ahead and eat raw meat, no salt, no oil, nothing. Maybe boil it. But that's it. Like your meat now?
9463 2018-07-20 17:35:13 Si es asi es porque como vengo diciendo el gas oil no tiene un peso significativo en la estructura de costos de 19 mil empresas agropecuarias (la mitad del total)
9464 2018-07-20 17:34:57 @cafreeland I have a work problem with the oil company PEMEX and I asked for your help to intercede for me with the president despot,ignorant,pusillanimous of Mexico ENRIQUE PEÑA NIETO who has ignored me, for when he comes to Mexico and talks to him, he comments my situation,2of2
9465 2018-07-20 17:34:56 Would be really surprised if they did. They must surely believe there's more chance Brexit will be stopped or a second vote may occur.
If it is a no deal scenario they could end up with Scotland and Europe's largest oil reserves/ large seafood and renewables potential
9466 2018-07-20 17:34:54 Kathy is our essential oil in this current hornet's nest of a nation. Namas fucking te!

9470 2018-07-20 17:33:59 The best way to keep Russia in check is bolstering our support for NATO, placing B61 (mod 11 and 12) nuclear bombs in Poland and the Baltic’s, and continue producing as much oil and natural gas as possible.
9471 2018-07-20 17:33:37 Seen road accident dead but not in close enough contact or long enough to smell them, think it takes some time for the smell to begin. Only obvious smell was blood and oil.
9472 2018-07-20 17:33:13 I use the little ones and cut them in quarters with carrots and cauliflower in foil. Toss some oil and spices in, wrap it up and stick it on the grill till it’s tender. Soooo good!!!
9473 2018-07-20 17:33:13 Nope, recipe biase2 je

1 jar sos prego
2 cube pati daging
1 botol sos life(regular size)
1 plastic bag of minced beef
1 or 2 minced onion
3 tea spoons of olive oil

Sama je kan recipe?
9474 2018-07-20 17:33:10 Don't forget we can probably stumble across Enclave members who were stationed in bunkers close to where our vault is.

The oil rig wasn't the only "safe haven" for high ranking officials of the government.

Vault exploration could still be possible, hopefully.
9475 2018-07-20 17:33:07 AB has had a carbon tax since 2008 and the oil industry is pleased to lower emissions and capture carbon. #reformaCONlies

9478 2018-07-20 17:32:49 Can't wait to see your fight against oil wars, police shootings, death penalty, climate change, meat eating then. Or do you only care about bio ethics issues that allow you to control women?

9480 2018-07-20 17:32:21 3/3  so, Democrats must come out with a "This is Putin" or "Life in Russia" threatdown style of ad (think Willy Horton) to either remind or teach for the first time that Russia is not a buddy nation that we should just get along with while we manage the oil market to our benefits

It pays bank but this the first job where multiple shit could kill me if I’m not careful
9485 2018-07-20 17:31:18 The threshold should be inflation adjusted.   Who cares about a $750 gift? Or even a thousand.   In this day and age.    I am more concerned about 300 million loans and commissions on oil deals.
9486 2018-07-20 17:31:18 When you try to open the jelly jar and you struggle. Then start thinking of ways you would get it off like an oil wretch or some channel locks

9490 2018-07-20 17:30:50 Why oil changes be so damn much 
9491 2018-07-20 17:30:49 Since I’m WFH today I have slathered myself in jojoba oil in hopes that it makes my skin glow and my hair shine...like within a few hours 
9492 2018-07-20 17:30:47 Really wish @springsteen would rub oil all over his bare chest and wrestle our president in a steel cage.
9493 2018-07-20 17:30:46 Whip together 9 oz cayenne pepper with 1 pound curry. Add generous amounts of Olive Oil. Drain. Serve with chili
9494 2018-07-20 17:30:42 the oil light isn't supposed to tell you it's low, it tells you it's lost pressure, which means you've already done damage and it's been low for a while. check ur oil son

9502 2018-07-20 17:30:14 Coconut oil helps. Normally I put it on my hair and them I go to sleep, it works for me, I hope it also works for you 
9503 2018-07-20 17:30:14 So I’m sitting here at Walmart getting my oil changed and then Wind Beneath My Wings came on. My grandma is telling me she’s here with me because I’ve been sitting here by myself for over an hour. I miss her.
9504 2018-07-20 17:29:47 Lmao get that oil change

9506 2018-07-20 17:29:23 @Dischem  We walked in for an essential oil worth +-R19, 3 hours and R700 (my colleague R1900) later we walked out. Wow, I'm in disbelief, please share the details of your sangoma
9507 2018-07-20 17:29:14 I wish I could wear dewy but I would look like an oil slick my face is wayyyyy to greasy

9509 2018-07-20 17:29:11 Baby oil
9510 2018-07-20 17:29:02 water, coconut oil, water water water.
9511 2018-07-20 17:29:02 No, that brand is considered harmful. In north Palm oil is not sold by many shopkeepers. Restaurants and road-side vendors do use them as cheaper, 30%less than soy/seed oils. D. Ghee is 4.5-5x price of seed oils. New brands of palm oil has 0-2% trans now.

9515 2018-07-20 17:28:00 See, my skin usually dries out during the summer, so I have to constantly moisturize it. That’s why i use coconut oil. Other than that, i’ll look ashy lol
9516 2018-07-20 17:27:57 I sometimes suspect that a lot of historical trends are caused by what's essentially random chance.
Why is Wahhabi such a powerful ideology today even though it's objectively terrible? Because a Wahhabi warlord happened to find an ASTONISHING amount of oil under his land.
9517 2018-07-20 17:27:54 I’ve been saying I’m only like 300 miles over needing an oil change.. I just calculated it and im 3,388 over so if that tells you anything of how great of an adult I am 
9518 2018-07-20 17:27:53 Jealous of a bimbo that looks like this, Biko let me ask you how do you want to feed me when I work in a oil and gas quality control laboratory, Biko I don't need your runs money, hold it 
9519 2018-07-20 17:27:33 Aims to keep Saudi and UAE happy too, and raise oil prices.
9520 2018-07-20 17:27:32 You can try fake meat. Some of them taste really close to the real texture. P.s, it's the seasoning and plant based foods you like to taste with your meat  try eating it raw, or only boiled. No oil or salt, nothing.
9521 2018-07-20 17:27:29 The economic incentive behind toppling a tyrant was of oil cartels of Total & BP (British Petroleum) French & British conglomerates respectively, the totalitarian was penalised because he wasn't agreeing to some oil concessions & exploitation in his country, the aligned tyrants
9522 2018-07-20 17:27:25 And even the ash from the crematorium was washed away by rain into the ocean... We are now busy becoming oil of the future.. Settling pale chini.

9526 2018-07-20 17:26:39 Also noticed today a massive floor in @BhamCityCouncil poorly thoughtout cycle route between the dual track Selly oak and onwards. Built between trees. Leaves fall off trees and form oil like surface. Crash waiting to happen. #nohealthandsafetythoughtsthere
9527 2018-07-20 17:26:38 Oils and dripping are a lot better now and there is not much between them in frying temperatures or health factors. The biggest thing is your demographic, if you are up North most customers want dripping and South most customers prefer oil.

Hillary, Crimea, Ukraine, the 400lb guy, fake news, Hillary, oil, sanctions, banking, spanking, Hillary, Magnitsky, and the Ritz!

That's what I WOULD guess, WOULDN'T you?
9540 2018-07-20 17:25:27 I've obviously hit the spot there, what with claims of unicorns, snake oil 'n' all. All very logical.
9541 2018-07-20 17:25:27 Cooperation in trade has grown over centuries, so is not going to end. Wars have mainly been fought for territory when oil and resources (Middle East and Africa) give control of wealth. But today the real big money derives from social and intellectual capital, so war LESS likely.

9547 2018-07-20 17:24:30 “Yes I’m just gonna get the oil change for now”
9548 2018-07-20 17:24:24 I’m not sure what you are referring to with that message? Is that who imports oil from who? 

Also this wasn’t about Hitler, but an example to illustrate that one awful oppressive country buys oil from another oppressive country instead of a country just like it
9549 2018-07-20 17:24:22 I want more choices. I want 3rd, 4th, & 5th parties. I would love a solid Democratic candidate. I want progressive candidates too. I want fiscally conservative anti-war candidates. But our top business is war, weapons, oil, energy & gas. These people don't change easily...

9560 2018-07-20 17:22:54 At some point possibly - Just doing 12-14 hours days at the moment to finish an oil painting.
9561 2018-07-20 17:22:52 What impact does ,for example, oil based clothing have upon our environment and should those who produce / sell them not be stopped from doing so and anyone involved who allegedly cares for countryside exposed? Comments @CA_TimB
9562 2018-07-20 17:22:43 Yeah just NEVER play Vice Versa. You will have people breaking out the olive oil and getting prayed for immediately.

9572 2018-07-20 17:21:44 The speed of the steam in Multan, its oil is rising
The oil slip which is poured into the oil bus, the difference is a big difference
If there is a 100 liters drive, 90 liters will be played,but the slipper will be written 100
Maybe 5 liters of pumps and 5 liters of drivers maybe
9573 2018-07-20 17:21:38 It’s honestly ridiculous I have 250 for insurance, 100 for car payment, and then 200 for gas basically. That all doesn’t include if something breaks, oil changes, etc... 
9574 2018-07-20 17:21:29 Funtua in southern Katsina State is the largest collection center for primary agricultural products for the North West. Commodities like cotton, groundnuts, leather and grains are first collected there and evacuated by rail. It has the oldest cotton ginnery and oil mills.

9588 2018-07-20 17:19:10 The smoke point of light olive oil is about 470 degrees. A burger becomes safe to eat around 170 degrees internal temp. Next time you cook a burger on the stove top, lower the temp to just above medium and leave the burgers to cook (3-5 mins per side) while covered.

Any comment on this @CA_TimB ?
9592 2018-07-20 17:18:39 Why are there coffins? That’s right a bogus war based on bogus intel. Supporting people who send others to die for lies and ultimately oil is the height of unamerican behavior.

9612 2018-07-20 17:15:53 I'm not so sure about this.  I do think that cbd oil has cured many things and I am just now a believer.  I think this is why they have fought so hard to keep it off the market.

9639 2018-07-20 17:13:13 What did Putin win? Did Trump change any of his policies towards Putin?  Were sanctions taken off. Was arm sales stopped to Ukraine? Was our oil business stopped to help him?  Weird analysis of you guys?

9696 2018-07-20 17:05:58 True, but the #Russen can't drink oil and eat gas. They need commodities they can't produce themselves. The got raw materials and resources, and no consumer goods industries worth mentioning.
9697 2018-07-20 17:05:56 Now a real issue, bad tasting ketchup in Germany! As if being tied to Russian oil and gas was not bad enough! Definitely their culture is a disaster! Immigrants behind this maybe? Tariff war a factor? Maybe its Merkel's leadership, did not listen to DT, same mistake as May! WIU

9823 2018-07-20 16:55:25 I don't blame you. Lmao I been on some fuck it shit and just keep buying a cheap lil bottle of oil to make sure my levels don't get too low I'm over it. 
9824 2018-07-20 16:55:16 Marinate naked infant in oil of exorcism overnight. Fresh ground pepper optional. In the morning, sprinkle with 1 Tbsp water from flesh flowing source. Repeat as necessary for removal of sins.
9825 2018-07-20 16:55:15 We've got our own gas fields and so has Scotland, where's England's oil/gas fields. Anything you have has been plundered from your neighbours.
9826 2018-07-20 16:55:09 multitasking has taught me that:

1. i’m easily distracted

2. when i juggle too many things i miss out on the good stuff

3. my dog loves egg sandwiches on sourdough bread with heirloom tomatoes and truffle oil mustard

4. he’s an asshole
9827 2018-07-20 16:55:01 Not to mention OPEC is screwing the American people daily with oil prices!! Gas is ridiculous and we are so over taxed on every front!! Most Americans would realize how we are getting screwed when the sit down and figure out all the taxes they pay on everything!
9828 2018-07-20 16:55:00 I’ve been into the studio and set up the next painting which will be another oil from the Exmouth sketch book. This time it all be a view of Budleigh Salterton Beach. I’m looking forward to starting it.
9829 2018-07-20 16:54:59 Oh are we gonna play that old song again? Right, but ignore every Destiel positive thing he has said and done since then why don't you, like encouraging the fandom to write Destiel oil rig fanfiction or high fiving Misha when he was told 'Tombstone' was called 'Brokeback natural'
9830 2018-07-20 16:54:55 Dominic, I’ll use small words for ya buddy, 2003 Lukoil (Russian oil co.) opened a gas station in NY. Putin and Schumer attended in full view of press. Schumer tweeted the traitor he will gladly testify under oath about this meeting, asked traitor for same. 
9831 2018-07-20 16:54:54 粘土こねこね
9832 2018-07-20 16:54:48 A solution to plastic waste may be thinking of plastic as an intermediary step between raw oil extraction and oil as energy.
Instead of dig it up, process it, burn it - 
Dig it up, process it, drink out of it (plastic bottles,) burn it.
9833 2018-07-20 16:54:36 Spilt my Jamaican black castor oil accidentally into my pillow so I can’t do ANYTHING about it. Let’s all mourn with me #GirlBuyZA

9835 2018-07-20 16:54:01 The Green Party also supports Roe Vs Wade not just the Democrats. Plus they support universal healthcare, public education & labor rights at home while having a sane Middle East policy that supports Palestinian rights & is against interventionist wars for oil/profits.

9836 2018-07-20 16:53:50 He is a traitor and a snake oil salesman
9837 2018-07-20 16:53:40 That bullying began earlier by us/nato with buying influence into ukranian oil companys which rendered russian influence. Foreign policy is never just Black/white.
9838 2018-07-20 16:53:28 Good lord big oil is getting scared...
9839 2018-07-20 16:53:24 And they’re still trying to come back from the damage to their economy after Crimea and Obama’s request of the Saudi’s to glut the oil market - not a shot fired by us, but it really hurt them after Crimea.
9840 2018-07-20 16:53:14 Even with all this inflation, trade war, oil, deficit talk .... 10 year below 3% 
9841 2018-07-20 16:53:00 another sad trump lover story.
just one of the millions yet to see where trump's snake oil will lead them.
9842 2018-07-20 16:52:58 I remember last time’s release of oil reserve was made same time with Japan tsunami at 2011. Two years later WTI plummeted under 40 by the “tsunami” of then looming shell oil revolution.
9843 2018-07-20 16:52:46 These are some strange people. As with tobacco now oil and gas companies the government controls it,regulates it and taxes it at every level and then they cry foul when they need more cash. Idiots
9844 2018-07-20 16:52:32 @RickPhD_MPE Hey Rick, any idea where I can find some actual data on Rick Simpson Oil? There is a ton of anecdotal evidence that it helps with cancer but I haven't found a credible source to back that up.
9845 2018-07-20 16:52:03 Jojoba oil is the natural, health-conscious alternative to baby oil or Vaseline - both petroleum derivatives that should be avoided.
9846 2018-07-20 16:51:58 The plan is obvious - all parties hope more oil revenue comes out of somewhere to cover this, or the province faces large scale service & job cuts. No lender is going to fund electricity subsidies.
9847 2018-07-20 16:51:55 Wow some common sense. These oil companies should sue the  City for the legal fees.
9848 2018-07-20 16:51:55 My point was that it is in the economic interests of Canada to sell oil while oil still has high value. However, it might not be in the best interests of the Earth.
9849 2018-07-20 16:51:50 Toralmente de acuerdo.  Y te olvidaste de Kuntur Wasi y Hunt Oil/Camisea con su amigote del Solar Simpson.  Si quieres te doy info

9861 2018-07-20 16:50:30 Pasta should also work, though I've never tried it.  Could also replace sesame oil with olive oil, maybe.

For the heat, I wet a towel and wrap it around my neck.  It feels wasteful to turn on the A/C when the kids are at school and I'm at home by myself.  HTH.
9862 2018-07-20 16:50:23 thinking about listening to the audio track of heat on mono because one earbud got dipped into a jar of coconut oil
9863 2018-07-20 16:50:22 ok im fna go get my oil changed ima call u when im done
9864 2018-07-20 16:50:21 Yes it seems Rubio is again showing his true colors. Yet he wonders why he lost. Stupid statements won’t help him next time either.
9865 2018-07-20 16:50:15 It does me the same. I can't put much on my scalp thanks to psoriasis. I use a lil oil to make my locs shine. Dassit.
9866 2018-07-20 16:50:14 Come on UN, step up to the plate against NK oil import actions! T, keep working toward NK denuclearization! Keeping sanctions strong.
9867 2018-07-20 16:50:08 I hate the internet for popping the mystical origins of donuts. That's it fry dough in oil. My life is not the same as before.
9868 2018-07-20 16:50:06 Black seed oil >>>

9871 2018-07-20 16:50:01 Kansas City Southern: Record Q2 revenue as Auto up 17% with Chemicals/Oil up 14%. But challenging FX on intermodal out of Mexico. $KSU
9872 2018-07-20 16:49:55 How did u determine its olive oil?
9873 2018-07-20 16:49:54 くだらないシチュのバカっぽい絵の方が私らしいかもしれんな
9874 2018-07-20 16:49:53 I herd he was dq’d for checking the oil of his opponents. I could be wrong on that, better check it out.
9875 2018-07-20 16:49:50 I can’t believe it’s people out here that don’t know about Tea Tree Oil  shit saved my life 
9876 2018-07-20 16:49:43 1 can chickpeas, 1-2 lemons depending on your liking, start out with 2 spoon fulls of olive oil and then add depending on consistency, 1 garlic clove, Salt and Cumin to taste. That’s like the basic basic hummus we always make and it’s super good 
9877 2018-07-20 16:49:35 I cut my hair right before I went to New York & it has grown back already!!  I guess what they say is true, because I’ve had my hair in 2 braids since i got back & the only thing I’ve done to it is oil it lol
9878 2018-07-20 16:49:31 idk if you require greens for it to be ‘salad’ but this summer i am loving zucchini, tomato, avocado and feta w/ oil and vinegar, and this weekend i am going to make smashed cucumber salad bc it looks so so so good to me
9879 2018-07-20 16:49:26 And there are more people employed in Canada in the green energy sector than the oil industry.
9880 2018-07-20 16:49:24 Depending on length, oil and balm for best results! Check out our free sample offer, it is a great way to try out our products and to find a scent you like :)

9882 2018-07-20 16:49:05 infused olive oil is simply awesome! we also use other types of extracts ... tinctures ..butters ... sugars and now we're getting into water infused stuff :) TCH/CBD water
9883 2018-07-20 16:48:59 I did safety in the oil fields on North Dakota. Basically I was on my computer all day... trading lol. To be transparent, I hadn’t paid myself from any profits that I ever made. It was $ that I didn’t depend on in my life. So compound profits keep compounding....
9884 2018-07-20 16:48:46 I agree...and have said the same thing.  Damning rivers and pumping raw sewage into them impacts the environment too.  But BC and QC who are 2 of biggest culprits of this continue to ignore that argument and keep bashing oil producing provs.

9886 2018-07-20 16:48:36 Stop supporting shale oil pipelines in Canada #StopPipelines
9887 2018-07-20 16:48:36 1) weak dollar not going to happen
2) weak dollar will make your purchases more expensive, your cost of living will exceed the profit of it
3) saudis have the same problem, expensive oil increased their cost if imports more than their profit from oil
9888 2018-07-20 16:48:33 I cook egg noodles, drain, and add sesame oil.  I can leave that in the fridge for a bit.  If I feel fancy, I'll shred some leftover chicken, carrots, and cucumbers and mix it in with the noodles.  If I'm lazy, I add some ground pepper into the noodles.

9892 2018-07-20 16:48:07 I tried to give up bread this summer. That lasted about ten minutes!
So I compromise and instead of jam and butter, I slather my whole wheat toast with mashed avocado, lemon-olive-oil drizzle, sea salt and cracked black pepper.
That has me feeling comforted...for now.
9893 2018-07-20 16:48:03 garlic and oil
9894 2018-07-20 16:48:01 Mom: "what do you want me to bring you from Spain?"
Me: "olive oil!"
Mom: "but you told me to never check in luggage..."
Me: (damn it) "... you're right, that was a test"
9895 2018-07-20 16:47:52 CNN , bbc and the rest that frequents reported Boko haram and other Obama administration led campaign against his government were are they now reporting our issues with that same vigour. America stopped buying our oil during GEJ TIME , they refused to sell us arms
9896 2018-07-20 16:47:29 I didn’t do it.
The 1st shop did trying to start her.
My oil was filled with gas & my plugs were soaked with fuel as well.
From now on, Mazda will get my car.
It’s obvious they know the rotary engine & trying to save $ by avoiding the dealer...doesn’t work :)
9897 2018-07-20 16:47:26 Lol cuz all foods here r OIL not food
9898 2018-07-20 16:47:12 I predict they'll meet somewhere other than the WH...Mar-a-Lago maybe. It will be somewhere billionaires, Big Oil executives, NRA leadership and Putin's operatives can secretly come and go with no official record of their meetings.
9899 2018-07-20 16:47:05 WHY THE FUCK DO PEOPLE THINK THEY NEED TO BRING THEIR DOGS TO GET THEIR OIL CHANGED? 3 fuckin dogs in the waiting room atm. Such Bullshit.  Fkn non-service pets should be banned from places of employment that aren't in the pet industry.
9900 2018-07-20 16:46:54 Thereby proving you haven't bothered to read it. Yes there's an interesting link to 'Polymer Enhanced Oil Recovery' and some good stuff under 'Technology' tab
9901 2018-07-20 16:46:47 I finally got an oil change & my car feels like it’s normal self again! 
9902 2018-07-20 16:46:46 I still remember Master chief M E Sri Kolhapur who daringly trained us how to fight & tackle a open oil fire .INS Avinash, where we learned how to control flooding .Great !
9903 2018-07-20 16:46:46 What was the issue oil for food scam in UN? I have read in public domain that this was one thing which worked against you for Secretary General post at UN. Counter me if wrong.

9906 2018-07-20 16:46:16 I use oils and oil infused products for just about everything now!!
9907 2018-07-20 16:46:16 やはり休日出勤の言葉の重みが勝ってしまった。。。
9908 2018-07-20 16:45:56 This oil change is taking up so much of my day but at least they’re playing Finding Dory in here
9909 2018-07-20 16:45:52 Only 2Aers could draw this parallel... I'm convinced the fumes from the oil they use to polish their "compensators" kills braincells.
9910 2018-07-20 16:45:45 Oil and water.
9911 2018-07-20 16:45:40 And why are the share prices of most shale companies at record low, despite high oil? In my view, shale companies are just before a major collapse due to sky high depletion rates. They have been saved by the policy to push up oil, yet this will not last forever.
9912 2018-07-20 16:45:35 President Trump- just one thing friend... There are proto-type cars out there converted from factory unleaded gas which use 90% water & 10% used oil or crude oil,kerosene,gasoline, what ever is combustible. Time to wean America off of excessive use of Fossil fuel consumption. Sir
9913 2018-07-20 16:45:32 This 

(And I made a leave in conditioner spray out of conditioner, argan oil, and water. It’s the shit tbh)
9914 2018-07-20 16:45:09 For the amount of almond oil or coconut oil certain so-named products of big brands contain, might as well market them as Mineral Oil Infused with Almond/Coconut Oil.
9915 2018-07-20 16:45:07 That should lower gas prices in Hawaii but if you want lower gas prices anywhere on the continental US then you need to increase oil production.
9916 2018-07-20 16:45:01 my main assumptions in following 2-3 months:
- eurusd up,
- gold & silver up,
- oil down.

the nuclear bomb - chinese tariffs on us oil - is the name of the game. it will be huge when explodes.
9917 2018-07-20 16:44:59 Now , oil is also in religious taste

9919 2018-07-20 16:44:50 I like a rotation into real gold/silver,oil and buy faang on the dips and sell into strength 1% upside each downturn.Then on the FAANG Collapse Short Facebook ,Tesla,Netflix
9920 2018-07-20 16:44:45 Healy went to the IMF after Britain entered Europe-Also much of the world was suffering problems due to the huge rise in oil prices and the effect that had on multiple economies-This is rather superficial view of events (I'm a remainer by the way!)
9921 2018-07-20 16:44:42 So you cry about him being a nationalist, but call him a global traitor? He did kill Russian soldiers in Syria. How has he gained anything? Our "Ally" Germany buys their oil from Russia, but he's a traitor. Get off Twitter with your stupidity
9922 2018-07-20 16:44:30 I just watched a news segment about kids dying in hot cars and now I’m very emotional in this gas station waiting for my oil to get changed.
9923 2018-07-20 16:44:29 You had 1 title in 100 years until the oil money

9931 2018-07-20 16:43:46 Is it things that you would never need, or things that you do not need at the moment? My missus buys items in bulk when they are on special knowing that we would need them e.g. flour, oil, canned foods and toiletries.

9943 2018-07-20 16:42:03 And at the time I was surprised that I actually supported an Oil Man. Tillerson hit the nail on the head. I say instead of Putin coming here - we let Trump go to Moscow - ONE WAY! Putin can take care of the MORON. @GOP appeasers may go with him! 
9944 2018-07-20 16:42:00 There is no L. Can’t wait to slap you around like we did last year, oil money couldn’t save you then
9945 2018-07-20 16:41:54 What I love about Liverpool spending money is City fans coming out and trying to say they are ruining football. 

City literally operate purely on Oil money 

League 2 would beckon if they didn’t get that take over years back.

日曜日に出勤してる設定になるじゃんね！！！？死ゾ！？
9948 2018-07-20 16:41:40 I don’t think it’s nuanced at all. I think it’s politically and philosophically incoherent.  Its a post-2016 reaction to the Russia/Trump story, that’s all. It’s as shortsighted as an environmentalist rooting for an oil company just because the oil company is anti-Trump.
9949 2018-07-20 16:41:32 @elonmusk @Tesla Don't listen to all the naysayers. If you need an extra Tesla storage let me know. It would look amazing in Oklahoma where the oil and gas industry is not doing their part. State doesn't have school on fridays. #kidsarenotourfutureiguess

9953 2018-07-20 16:40:44 I literally can’t stand getting work done on my car, I’ve been at this place trying to get my oil changed and in five mins this man has tried to offer me 15 different things. Stressing me tf out 
9954 2018-07-20 16:40:40 I also recommend joining the Jeep wave club when you buy it bc then you get good deals on stuff & free oil changes, maintenance, etc.
9955 2018-07-20 16:40:40 Arab world certainly has a deep racism problem but it is different than  that in Dubai. Modern Dubai as it is was only built a few years back with most of the real owners being rich oil people. It is a city of expats/migrants. Less than 15% of the residents are from the UAE
9956 2018-07-20 16:40:34 if you don’t have makeup remover try  coconut oil sjjjjkkjsdd

9958 2018-07-20 16:40:06 I so remember the video of Trump saying he sent out a team of investigators to get the dirt on Obama's birth certificate saying they couldn't believe what they were finding...
And we never heard from Trump again about it...
He's such a con man
Grifter, snake oil salesman...
9959 2018-07-20 16:40:03 cant wait to make my own body lava by riri so i can use it when i go to the beach.

i literally just googled what kind of oil to use and im all gud
9960 2018-07-20 16:40:01 You did it through oil money what are you struggling to understand. Before that you where getting battered by Middlesbrough
9961 2018-07-20 16:39:59 @glutinofoods I adore the Lemon flavored GF Wafers, however because of the use of soy oil and soy lecithin I can no longer have them. I’d love to enjoy soy free gf wafers.

9965 2018-07-20 16:39:39 He is deluded -power sent Blair mad..The road to Hell is paved with good intentions.
When 911 came along the world woke up to the level of HATE that some Islamic sects had for the west. Funded by Gulf oil wealth.
Bush / Blair response -WAR.
years of War csussing power vacuums.

9967 2018-07-20 16:39:19 Bought any good snake oil lately?
9968 2018-07-20 16:39:17 I'm sure it's possible to find the right oil, but there isn't really much evidence on positive outcomes, and I can't imagine running that experiment myself. :)
9969 2018-07-20 16:39:14 Something tells me you piss crude oil
9970 2018-07-20 16:39:10 I tried Good Genes but couldn’t stomach the smell. Thanks for the oil cleanser rec. added it to my amazon list.
9971 2018-07-20 16:38:58 Me and females are like water and oil we just don’t mix

Again whom monitors the storage especially once the produce/product has left the producing / production line,producing / production facility gates > continuously? 

Again NOT whatsover limited to Olive Oil variants ?  ^5's
9975 2018-07-20 16:38:30 Would anyone like an oil commission? 
The painting i tweeted last night is my best example
9976 2018-07-20 16:38:29 Conozco policias y militares y coroneles que nunca mataron a nadie. Mi abuelo trabajó en la tropical oil company y tenía arma y nunca la usó.

9978 2018-07-20 16:38:12 .@Valvoline thank you for always having boss ass ladies working your oil change centers
9979 2018-07-20 16:38:04 Trying new experiments on how to dry oil
9980 2018-07-20 16:38:03 I need to go to Walmart, get my feet done, a oil change and a car wash.
9981 2018-07-20 16:38:03 I might be naive, but Scotland in my view has more resources than England. Their finance industry is predicated somewhat by oil producers. If I was #eu , I’d dump England and go with #Scotland, we have loads, easy competent parliament...
9982 2018-07-20 16:37:55 Ask me how to waste an oil paint.  Hahahhahahaha.
9983 2018-07-20 16:37:49 En Oil son 99% hombres... por no decir 100% y justo me conteste la unica mujer...
9984 2018-07-20 16:37:48 I'm just slicker than niggas like olive oil
9985 2018-07-20 16:37:43 Don't forget the victims of their non existing gun regulations. 
And: they never went  to war for humanitarian reasons. No gain no pain. No oil or other resources - no interest.
9986 2018-07-20 16:37:30 More oil, less you. The oil has no struggles, more surrendering to the anointing.
9987 2018-07-20 16:37:24 I spent the entire Bush admin being told I hated America and hated freedom just because I didn't want to see my generation sent to a senseless war for oil. Now those same people have no problem with their president working for a foreign enemy. #TRAITORS #TraitorInTheWhiteHouse
9988 2018-07-20 16:37:09 Could be worse, you could be dumb like me and forget to pull the vent plug on the drain pan when you dump oil on the generator at work. Used diesel oil everywhere...

9991 2018-07-20 16:36:46 We r also facing almost same dillema here in India at the hands of Pakistani n Bangladeshi lobby.

Today whole EU and west too is also effected by oil money lobby... My heartfelt best wishes for innocents...
9992 2018-07-20 16:36:43 Oil e hoor
9993 2018-07-20 16:36:33 Also it’s a really *thick* oil. The outside of the dropper is pretty thoroughly coated and needs to be wiped off into the bottle.
9994 2018-07-20 16:36:26 I enjoy painting but when it comes to washing oil paint from your brushes or from your skin........it’s a WHOLE headache
9995 2018-07-20 16:36:23 Was going to make curry chicken with white rice for dinner.  I forgot to pick up oil so I’ll just grab egg foo young and the chinese spot

9999 2018-07-20 16:35:54 Tea tree oil works wonders on your face.. but LISTEN TO ME , do not apply that shit before you leave the house .
10000 2018-07-20 16:35:45 Not sure if you NEED the oil?  Send me a PM and I will research for your issue for you.
10001 2018-07-20 16:35:45 You’re giving Cambridge Analytica too much credit - their “psychoanalysis” based on Like history is snake oil. Don’t forget they also worked with Ted Cruz, this whole scandal is making it look like their tech is actually useful 
10002 2018-07-20 16:35:42 Some talk of oil in the groove in three -- per the No. 48 radio #NASCAR
10003 2018-07-20 16:35:38 Nope. Don’t believe it. We were categorically told in 2014 that the oil was about to run out. Surely you don’t think they made a “mistake” now?
10004 2018-07-20 16:35:36 Apa beza cleansing oil dgn cleansing lotion?
10005 2018-07-20 16:35:07 and you rile

10006 2018-07-20 16:35:00 I must look very approachable because I’ve been trying to study since 10 while getting my oil changed and people keep talking to me 
10007 2018-07-20 16:34:59 So system way overcharged, to much oil, and a shit ton of air. Pulling the evap out to clean it. It’s giving us problems, a nut is stuck on the line. Guy had to run to his shop to get the big boy tools.
10008 2018-07-20 16:34:59 Oil no dey bring money again. Na travel sure pass, as everyone wan travel leave country
10009 2018-07-20 16:34:49 Birds are super sensitive, have very low body mass and delicate respiratory systems. You might be able to find a particular oil that is okay, but I'm not sure it's worth the risk. They don't give many signals about being adversely affected until it's too late.
10010 2018-07-20 16:34:31 Can't get enough of it lately. Frozen kale, with a little onion, garlic, oil, salt and pepper, delicious.
10011 2018-07-20 16:34:28 I think I started turning on capitalism when I read The Four Hour Work Week. The whole of business advice in it is 'Start a snake oil company and get people in India to do your customer support for you.'
10012 2018-07-20 16:34:23 Still a good question, and no, I wasn’t. Silly me. I thought an oil would stay blended. (Not a tincture, oil based. And not shaking it means god only knows what sort of dosing I’ve been getting and I basically have to reboot my knowledge of what any does does to me.) 
10013 2018-07-20 16:34:20 What comes out of Russia besides Fake News and Oil?

Nothing.
10014 2018-07-20 16:34:19 Well he may do that to his face his actions say otherwise we have kicked out diplomats and we have closed their diplomatic offices and we have messed with there oil prices.
10015 2018-07-20 16:34:17 Sounds like a busy weekend! Good luck with the oil tank!
