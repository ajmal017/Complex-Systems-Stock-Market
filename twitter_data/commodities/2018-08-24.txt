1 2018-08-26 23:52:05 Watch the commodities. That will give you a hint.
2 2018-08-26 23:44:00 Most artists think like commodities & not like visionaries or high-profile content creators. Changing the artistic mindset transforms any artist’s #ValueProposition perspective significantly...but there’s much work to do either way yet the latter pays huge dividends
3 2018-08-26 23:39:17 Congratulations, they have successfully transformed you from citizens into commodities.
4 2018-08-26 23:37:12 I personally think it’s a reasonable gamble given age/skill of SDA. I just felt Dubas was getting credit for doing something that most GMS do throughout the draft - take chances on unknown commodities.
5 2018-08-26 23:35:48 If all the fighters were average, everyone would stop watching. To compensate the commodities that attract the viewers, and revenue, they pay them more. See how this works?
6 2018-08-26 23:32:04 Competition is the weakest argument imo. Typical investors tend to understand commodities more than products, and cars are the latter. Wall Street has been saying android competition has caught up to iPhone since 2009. Even today they can’t explain why Apple is still crushing it.
7 2018-08-26 23:27:57 It’s 2018 and yes Wisdom and discretion are STILL more valuable commodities than gold and gemstones - Prov 3:15
8 2018-08-26 23:24:56 Good lord, that is so offensive. Farmers have benefitted enormously from export sales to China in a whole range of commodities.
9 2018-08-26 23:14:37 Drugs makes you addicted to commodities produced by capitalists and thus dependent on the continuance of capitalism.
10 2018-08-26 23:05:28 Countries need dollars to buy commodities like oil, which are all traded in USD. But no one is holding dollars as a support for their own currency to my knowledge. The world doesn't need $20 trillion in dollar assets, but right now, it's ok with it. For how long? I don't know.
11 2018-08-26 22:52:14 Vou trabalhar com exportação de commodities e ajudar a expandir a fronteira agrícola
12 2018-08-26 22:51:48 The lower prices of agricultural commodities are likely to be a market response to surplus production, and the availability of cheap alternatives. It's futile to look for sinister explanations.
13 2018-08-26 22:32:23 We see people as commodities not human beings.
14 2018-08-26 22:25:17 It’s more of a gamble to do nothing, watch your fiat become more worthless year after year, than to invest in solid commodities than generally go up in value over time. #BTC #DGB #GOLD #SILVER

30 2018-08-26 22:24:20 Excellent increase the price of commodities  to push people away from useing them. The problem is people will just pay the tax period. How about we put 100% of the tax money into funds to promote the development of alternative products then? Rather than into general revenue?
31 2018-08-26 22:20:50 This is a terrible market system for perishable commodities. For the perishable commodities a certain rate of return must sustain the gate price. If that means re-regulation then what are we waiting for? For essential commodities have never seen lack of #demand.

33 2018-08-26 21:46:34 Verdade. Mas o post eh de quinta... Requentaram... Mas vc acha q faz sentido essa relacao de commodities vs s&p? E se atualizar ateh agora, seria diferente? Vc conhece esse indice da Goldman e como se correlaciona com CRB? Abs!
34 2018-08-26 21:37:50 No. It wasn’t   All 3 r unproven commodities
35 2018-08-26 21:30:36 Good luck with ur #Trading this week #Stocks #Crypto #Cryptocurrency #Commodities #Currencies
36 2018-08-26 21:27:08 This is your inheritance left behind that led to increase the price of commodities and utility bills. You guys sucked all the resources of the country and now shamefully making noise of price hike. Do you consider people stupid?
37 2018-08-26 20:55:40 It was about 3 wks ago. Another day at work, another morning shift report, and night shift paired off with day shift for our assignments. I start learning about Patient A: multiple complications and commodities, including AIDs. Pronouns preferred: "she/her". (Part 1/?)
38 2018-08-26 20:54:29 But.. that stuff isn't free even in socialist countries. You are expected to work in exchange for commodities.
39 2018-08-26 20:31:17 Commodities were all rushing to front-run tariffs. Hence the huge jump in shipping data before tariffs take effect. 

Talk to anybody who works in this sector, everyone has been pushing stuff to get ahead of higher prices.
40 2018-08-26 20:16:23 By giving Kenyans the opportunity to afford basic commodities.
41 2018-08-26 20:00:02 In several parts of the world, many commodities are free. Even housing. They hunt their food, scavange for wood, clay and make bricks, build homes and tools, and even use rocks to filter water. You're right. We should do it all ourselves and fire everyone in production.
42 2018-08-26 19:31:34 Mhe. Stop bragging abt SGR its a total fail of the economy. You forcefully transport containers from KPA to Nrb and then back charging importers heftily raising costs of commodities. Transporters are losing millions leading to loss to the economy.
43 2018-08-26 19:29:05 Any other washed up WRs need to spend some one-on-one time with Dr. Belichick so they may come to terms with no longer being viable commodities? #EricDecker #Patriots #RetirementEnforcers
44 2018-08-26 19:25:33 This is where the education ministry comes in
We have to start putting value to this girls young..
Also we have to start teaching boys girls aren't commodities young 
Teaching a grown man about rape culture won't help coz his entire life it has been normalized
45 2018-08-26 19:15:40 Pero no estamos hablando de lana y mucjo menos de valor agregado,( de echo si le agregar valor en origen ni pagarían retenciones) estamos hablando de commodities. Corta vos crees que el que más gana no tiene que pagar más pq es todo mérito de el yo que hay que redistribuir.
46 2018-08-26 18:48:19 No es así de simple, el precio se tasa en los commodities de Nueva York, ante el abandono del gobierno mexicano (subsidios, mejora genética, precios etc) se ven obligados a venderlo a ese precio

47 2018-08-26 18:27:57 Na república, Lula foi o presidente com mais condições de fazer as reformas estruturais q o país necessitava

popularidade acima de 80%

superávit, boom de commodities e congresso amigo

mas se embriagou do poder e tomou o temporário como perene

se afundou e levou o país junto
48 2018-08-26 18:21:42 542...and diet only...no food included...#toobad...commodities getting higher.... No increment on wages... Not too good!!!
49 2018-08-26 18:16:34 Never take people's willingness for granted. Its one of most valuable commodities in the universe.
50 2018-08-26 18:12:52 Voor mij mag het ook...alleen..: in 1976 was het ook zo’n zomer. De zomer van 1977 was het ijskoud en heeft het heel de zomer geregend. Weer heeft geen garantielabel. Zou ook te saai worden op de commodities market ;-)
51 2018-08-26 18:07:47 @join angered  Solution is with our gov'rnt to reduce the prices of the common commodities & fight corruption
52 2018-08-26 18:05:54 Tax rebates for food commodities. Nationalise health, public transport, land, etc. CREATE jobs. But now that government made a deal with IMF to impose VAT on fuel products that will be hard given petroleum products are pervasive in all sectors of the economy ...
53 2018-08-26 18:05:43 I spent a short time in Hawaii. My understanding is the 14 days of personal prep supplies stems from just in time commodities- at any time the islands have 7-10 days of supplies on shelves (in blue skies)
54 2018-08-26 18:05:35 It's simple.Tighten the many loopholes where the government is losing revenue and do away with VAT on such basic commodities as food stuffs and fuel.Period @KIMANIICHUNGWAH #SundayLive
55 2018-08-26 17:41:32 There is a big problem in Kenya. The rate of inflation is ill motivated. Government should consider subsidising basic commodities and leverage policy framework for protection of the same. @KoinangeJeff @VickyRubadiri
#SundayLive
56 2018-08-26 17:36:21 Commodities are the opium of the people.
57 2018-08-26 17:32:30 Exactly. 

People think larger commodities like oil aren’t manipulated at all 
58 2018-08-26 17:27:58 Unless the dollar weakens there is no much hope for emerging mkts or commodities
59 2018-08-26 17:17:51 Like I said, the middle ground isn’t about making all commodities free. Your taking my argument to the extreme and then saying it won’t work.
60 2018-08-26 17:11:29 One of the negatives about live poker is having to deal with other humans at table.  Makes playing locally more dicey when some of the opponents are known commodities.

I failed miserably today in this respect and just couldn’t stand concept of being at that table all day.
61 2018-08-26 17:05:13 Yeah..? I do? And you know how much of a spike in taxes it will be to pay for food, education, water, and other commodities? It would be impossible for anyone in America to thrive, just as it has been in other socialist and communist countries.
62 2018-08-26 17:01:38 In the US military, like the rest of the English speaking world, if we call someone a “trader,” it’s because they buy & sell stocks, bonds, & commodities in their respective financial markets.

John McCain was a naval aviator, congressman, & senator, but he was no trader. 
63 2018-08-26 16:58:20 Income tax, sales tax, etc. is how the government gets most of its money, to get free water, food, healthcare, education and other little commodities, it would be an astronomical taxing of the ages that would absolutely send this country into shambles
64 2018-08-26 16:41:58 En sus periodos la soja y las retenciones estaban en su mejor momento, creciamos a tasas chinas y la industria tenia capacidad maxima, hoy los commodities estan en baja y las retenciones no representan mas del 7% del pbi, ojo!! Subirlas seria volver a perder area de maiz y trigo
65 2018-08-26 16:40:48 It's not just metals there is a War on commodities driven by HFT & an understanding that our "Weekend at Bernie's" economy can not tolerate a spike in commodities or interest rates. This is why their has been such a massive response to the Petro/Yuan threat to the Status Quo.
66 2018-08-26 16:39:28 My moms financial advisor looked at her crazy when she said she wanted to unload some stocks and buy commodities.

I should take his job but I wont.
67 2018-08-26 16:21:34 Does Times now show guts to speak on 1992 and 2002 riots. Debate on Petrol rise ,essential commodities price rise, unemployment, Ganga river cleaning scam, NPA accounts, beef export and value of ₹ against dollar etc?
68 2018-08-26 16:15:25 Not a commodities sales agent that only works for wiretaps, but a showgirl that works for everyone.
69 2018-08-26 16:15:22 Do have guts to speak against 1992 and 2002 riots. Your only agenda is target Rahul Gandhi. Why can’t speak about Petrol price rise, essential commodities price rise, Ganga clean, beef export etc.
70 2018-08-26 16:09:39 Mas já que insiste vamos lá:
1 - Todo país tem REPRESENTANTES internacionais;
TODO país quer se tornar o maior “player” senão o Brasil não teria nadado nas COMMODITIES da CHINA que LULA usou a rodo enganando o povo de que tinha “prosperado” a economia;
71 2018-08-26 16:01:57 A crise cambial em 98-99 tinha 2 componentes completamente distintos do quadro atual ..estávamos no coração da Crise Ásia 97, moratória Russa e quebra do fundo LTCM...E o Brasil tinha US $ 45-50 bi de reservas internacionais. .hoje 350 bi por conta da bolha de commodities 2004-10
72 2018-08-26 16:01:15 #NovaNatie is an established player in the Port of Antwerp! It operates 110.000 sqm warehouses located at 3 sites within the Port! Specialising in project cargoes, machinery, metals & steel, timber & plywood and soft commodities. Exhibiting at #AntwerpXL and don't miss them!
73 2018-08-26 15:58:32 Yo respeto lo que hicieron en 2002 Pero recuerden que está vez los commodities no están por las nubes, no creo que vayan a poder devaluar 200% y no estamos en default...
74 2018-08-26 15:51:56 Because the workers who maintain those commodities deserve no compensation for their labor.
75 2018-08-26 15:49:52 Nope, not weird at all. Many are still chasing that next shiny product to talk about and believe trends are only related to what the manufacturers are doing. It should be about the solutions, in partnership with the manufacturers and not the commodities specifically. #AVinTheAM
76 2018-08-26 15:38:07 No a la exportación de commodities, tenemos que agregar valor y ser eficientes en ello. Establecimiento San Miguel con su producción de cítricos le explica al país entero de qué se trata exportar mano de obra argentina. Fuerza MM, todo el apoyo para vos!
77 2018-08-26 15:35:23 Unrest near America is actually a warning for the US. A drone attack on madurao before few weeks and current #VenezuelaCrisis shows the unrest level in this country. A dictator is never good for the common man. #Inflation & scarcity for basic commodities is very high.
78 2018-08-26 15:34:20 But, you call animals commodities you pay to torture and murder for sensory pleasure?
79 2018-08-26 15:28:53 Of course they had to mention tampons, no they don't care about free commodities, they're just a Brainlet.
80 2018-08-26 15:14:07 Ok I’ll play your game for a second.i f the essence of capitalism is to turn nature into commodities, then as capitalism grows and people look to make more money, won’t they grow these commodities with them. Hence things like agriculture and farmed fish.
81 2018-08-26 15:02:55 Two hot commodities: N Walker & M Gonzalez. Switch hitters who can play all over the field.  Wouldn’t be surprised if both wind up on the Yankees.
82 2018-08-26 15:01:57 Galaxy, tweaking weapon and formed a reputation for commodities and homogenize itself in SGT. Lex is a hubbed extension of
83 2018-08-26 15:01:57 El giro racional. Convengamos que vino la crisis de las sub prime y bajaron las commodities.
84 2018-08-26 14:54:07 Yes, we should NOT have to praise basic human decency. But when campaigns of late have become ugly slaughter fests, & some use any opportunity to smear each other, with truth or with lies, McCain was generous, gentlemanly, honest. Sadly, right now, those are commodities we crave.
85 2018-08-26 14:49:57 Galat Soch 

Zero GST on essential commodities 

With proper tax planing, income upto 50 k per month no tax

Petrol prices are high so that energy consumption of our country can change 

Now Gas , solar  and nuclear energy to be given impetus 

Reduction in fossil consuption
86 2018-08-26 14:47:37 Deconstructing the Commodities of GIS: Interrogating Hospitality
87 2018-08-26 14:37:47 The divisions in society will continue to exist as long as people continue to profit from them 
That's the real issue with the society 
Capitalism warps people's minds to believe that everything has a price 
BASIC COMMODITIES SHOULD BE FREE
88 2018-08-26 14:34:24 The government needs to be very sensitive to the needs of its citizens. Let them review the cost of production of various commodities by lowering fuel prices not increasing it.
89 2018-08-26 14:27:32 Strange thing taste. Some desire animal poachers skin, whilst others prefer throwing money into less satisfying commodities.
90 2018-08-26 14:22:33 Chat w a commodities trader yesterday:
"No one is buying ANYthing" - tariffs have killed int'l buying

Under-reported story 
(Pathetic farmer pledging fealty to P0TUS despite losses doesn't cut it)
91 2018-08-26 14:18:17 Can't we just increase the mrp on all Commodities by ₹2-3 that will solely go for helping Kerala? We can easily raise thousands of crores by this. And it won't affect someone blatantly. @ShashiTharoor @RahulGandhi @narendramodi @PMOIndia @ArvindKejriwal
92 2018-08-26 14:14:32 En la primera etapa del gobierno anterior sobraban dólares luego del ajuste de 1998-2002 y la suba en los precios de commodities. En la última etapa, faltaban, y por ende se impuso el cepo. La economía, sin USD, se estancó a partir de 2011.
93 2018-08-26 14:11:11 #enacional en lugar de condonar la oligarquía que no lo necesita, porque no rebaja primeras necesidades de todos los demás como IVA al libro y medicamentos como tanto desestimó ministro?, porque seguir incentivando commodities como MAPA de ARAUCO castigando innovaciones como UBER
94 2018-08-26 14:08:40 Back when SM started others commodities had the chance but chose not to. Biggest thing with milk and eggs is daily management. You can’t store them and wait for a better price down the road.
95 2018-08-26 13:54:23 D for Dunce as in I can’t think for myself and I need the government to interfere in every aspect of my life and I want to stand in long lines for commodities handouts (like they do in Russia).
96 2018-08-26 13:48:41 The ever wise @mediajolt001 has rightly pointed out that it’s not a stock market I’m trying to emulate but a commodities market.
97 2018-08-26 13:45:27 You want to be informed about investor sentiment for #equities, #bonds, #fx and #commodities? Then follow @sentixsurvey and receive 3 sentiment highlights from Sunday to Tuesday #sentixtop3
98 2018-08-26 13:40:23 Supply and demand of commodities like bread and wheat are well balanced by the price mechanism. But they are way simpler than lots of other things that matter immensely.

100 2018-08-26 13:23:02 Agricultural Act of 1948 enacted price supports for commodities at 90% of parity.           Yes parity.
101 2018-08-26 13:18:38 Sasha Grey and How I Met Your Mother are the two most overrated commodities of all time
102 2018-08-26 13:16:25 As dollar is getting strengthen DOD, it is very negative for emerging markets and currencies are already collapsed as well as commodities.

So be careful in buying bcz it is globally everything falling except dollar.
103 2018-08-26 13:10:41 These ETFs never have to hold 1:1.  Even if they have to hold real $btc it will be just "fractional reserve".  SLV hold "real" silver but its 500+ paper oz for every real.  ETFs are how physical commodities are easily controlled.
104 2018-08-26 13:06:05 Absolutely right! To be fair, they also had Zach Miller, Russell Okung, Max Unger, Golden Tate, Brandon Mebane, Cliff Avril, Red Bryant etc. They were not bereft of known commodities. But that team was such a oddly put together team and surprised everyone.
105 2018-08-26 12:30:31 Thats not the point. $20M in cap space can get you known, proven commodities in the offseason without spending draft capital.

As much as I love Mack, its a huge price to pay - and one that doesn’t fit the NFL’s new cap-oriented model.
106 2018-08-26 12:27:22 It is. But a lot of money buys a lot of stuff. Trading it all away for free food and commodities for our entire population would expose us to a lot of risk & fundamentally change our way of life. You and I may disagree on how we feel about that, but that’s why we have elections
107 2018-08-26 12:20:17 With added international lilo commodities insider news!
108 2018-08-26 12:07:31 Mexico seemingly has most to lose. But if you consider they have plenty of wiggle room as the differential on wages allows them options that can be spread across all sectors. CDN oil, agriculture, minerals are commodities set by world prices. Our labour is higher than US Problem!
109 2018-08-26 11:58:42 INGOT Group provides through its entity INGOT Brokers, a wide variety of
products and services which includes ETFs, international shares and indices,
commodities, metals, energies, as well as currencies.
110 2018-08-26 11:44:42 That plus so much more Chris. The AI revolution that’s gradually gathering pace is going to create a massive opportunity to reinvent your total offering (product plus its promotion, delivery, support and value-adds) to appeal to those who aren’t turned on by commodities.
111 2018-08-26 11:34:14 i think we need to send donations in form of food medicines, clothing and essential commodities money can be misused by the babus and netas

113 2018-08-26 11:26:22 it's fucking bullshit that I have to expend currency to obtain commodities
114 2018-08-26 10:50:35 That is if Nigerians can survive another four years of hardship, herdsmen killing and high price of commodities in the market. How sure are we that he will hand over to an Igbo man come 2023? Anyway, @naij pls tell the igwe that He is speaking for himself and his family
115 2018-08-26 10:40:19 Então está ótimo, pois o Brasil não passa de uma colônia mequetrefe exportadora de commodities.

E que mesmo assim se recusa a estabelecer preço mínimo de frete para quem carrega seu produto do campo ao porto.
116 2018-08-26 10:11:36 Yeah, you see I don’t think so. I don’t think they are being overpaid because they are treated more or less like commodities. Most people with jobs can work till they are 60 or 70. 32 is considered the end for football player.
117 2018-08-26 10:02:41 "Two bloody years" wails puffy, but keeps wailing about the border, commodities which knows fuck all about, ps. on my cell phone oh great puffy in the sky.
118 2018-08-26 09:51:00 Simpleton I re-used your analogy & expanded upon it, in relation to any future commodities... do try & keep up!!
119 2018-08-26 09:49:30 This is great and all but just defining things as rights doesn’t make them appear. Things become more plentiful and affordable when they’re treated as commodities. Your basic necessities are not the rest of the nations responsibility. Socialism is a disease.
120 2018-08-26 09:39:16 Stop countries profiteering from the weapons trade.
Make the UN more effective .
Devise a world system for genuine food security and remove food from the commodities market.
Prosecute despots in an international court instead of invading their countries and killing their people.
121 2018-08-26 09:32:52 All of those aren't free because they really aren't free. Except for clean water found naturally, or food that grows in the wild (or such other example), things aren't conjured out of thin air without any cost. They cost. Which is why they are commodities by definition.
122 2018-08-26 09:28:09 Ugh! I'm so tired of this Sinophobia on the TL. CHINA IS NOT TRYNA COLONISE AFRICA!!! Do you people even know what colonisation means? China pays top dollar for everything it gets from Africa (and elsewhere) so much so that it actually skews the free market for commodities.
123 2018-08-26 09:06:22 It’s pretty much the same across all commodities
124 2018-08-26 09:06:19 #StreamPay is working on adding a trading module, to its platform.

125 2018-08-26 09:05:34 Drugs muddle up your self-understanding, you become a mushroom suckling on capitalist commodities.
126 2018-08-26 08:35:30 Neither I am nor anybody in my family and known are cadre of your corrupt party. Stop disrespecting Indians. We are human beings with feelings and emotions ,not some commodities that you can use for your benefits.
127 2018-08-26 08:10:15 @GoddessofGrain Hi Angie, can your recommend a good commodities podcast? Looking in iTunes but I don't see any that are highly rated. Thanks!!
128 2018-08-26 08:08:14 Research only simulates thoughts and social theories that are in the last instance just reflexes of #Marx's thoughts that are hidden under overloaded tinsel ornaments that appeal to the taste associated with commodities of the modern bazaar.

129 2018-08-26 08:08:05 Is there any shortage of buyers for NZ milk products?
Do NZ milk product fetch lower prices than other exported commodities?
I think we are doing just fine on the marketing.
If Glen wants to tear others down to pump up his pseudo science - all power to him.
130 2018-08-26 07:42:36 It's called speciesism. We treat some as friends and others as commodities. The lady in the video concludes with an honest statement: it's kind of conflicting.
131 2018-08-26 07:34:13 Commodities tend to zig, when the equity markets zag. � Jim Rogers
132 2018-08-26 07:03:01 surplus of resources and commodities that aren’t used therefore resulting in waste and extreme poverty rates and a classist society
133 2018-08-26 06:37:00 That's awful. It is what happens when people are seen as commodities.
134 2018-08-26 06:36:00 Well farmers are aware of their needs. They need #farmcredit, timely #Farminputs, Good #market for their products, and of course good price for the commodities
135 2018-08-26 06:34:04 Mr Trump, you are the only president who cares for his people, like Moshe. Other world leaders, sell their brothers and sisters into slavery, and instead of educating their brothers and sister; they sell all our commodities to these warmongers who come under the guise of peace.
136 2018-08-26 06:34:04 Kkkk if you believe at scaremongering I don’t know which Zimbabwe you live in. The are more bonds in circulation, gvt issued $60 million to pay PSMI and those bills were not backed by anything. lol at the rates and prices of basic commodities going up daily! New dawn 
137 2018-08-26 06:22:43 I’m definitely a huge macro nerd its just what flows in my blood. Curiosity of the world and the work that people put into it to churn the economy. Or global macroeconomy. FX Rates, cryptos, fiat currencies, commodities, natural resources, geopolitics. It’s a 24.7.365 sport.
138 2018-08-26 06:17:06 LIAR!!! You're just catering to oil and coal and don't give a damn about the environment. Once the air and water are foul you'll have two more priceless commodities to exploit; air and water which you'll sell at an extorsionate rate.
139 2018-08-26 06:10:33 we already get your labor to get these commodities. lol

the only difference is the money you get comes from the people through the gov instead of direct.

143 2018-08-26 05:14:53 Health Inspectors must do their work, stop bribery, check shops for fake commodities that society take care
144 2018-08-26 05:09:31 Risk-reward in options is skewed to make Option Writers and Option Buyers loose money. 

For ATM Option Writers, Risk:Reward is 10:1 intraday. For buyers 2:1 intraday. Black Swan favours hedged buyers & kills ATM sellers. Option Buying best in Commodities & Currency Derivatives.
145 2018-08-26 04:28:43 Its not easy for consumers especially in townships to identify fake audible commodities,the gvt must shut down all these Pakistan & Somali owned tuckshops,to make things worse they don't employ locals and they don't pay tax,,
146 2018-08-26 04:25:24 That’s because they are not employees- they are commodities.       #America
147 2018-08-26 03:59:35 Social media as a whole magnifies commodities and fetishism of all sorts that become way too material. A lot of people are better than this. It's easy to stare into the abyss and fall into it.
148 2018-08-26 03:48:24 It's so horrible and hostile esp where the US military has bases globally. Women in SE Asia are mere commodities to these pigs.
149 2018-08-26 03:31:37 Lol..If they’re aware of tariffs coming-as Trump has been talking about since the campaign days-they should be well-prepared to *not* produce so much. They’re only hurting their own bottomlines expending resources 2 collect commodities they won’t be able to sell. Their own fault.
150 2018-08-26 03:01:57 Great middlemen (commodities traders, investment bankers, art dealers, etc.) only take financial risk when they want to, and that is almost the opposite of WeWork's position.
151 2018-08-26 03:00:46 Quando se fala que o gov. Lula foi "bem" por causa do boom das commodities eh um absurdo. Agora ela fala que a crise foi por causa do preço do petróleo. Essa esquerda realmente é muito seletiva. Isso é fala de caráter.
152 2018-08-26 03:00:22 Are you shitting me? The only economic crisis in the last 50 years was 2008-2010? H I S T O R Y fucking books. Cyclical markets, stock, real estate, commodities...  Dot com bubble? Tulip bulbs? I wasn’t born for that one, but I sure learned from it. Fuck me 
153 2018-08-26 02:46:34 End your addiction to drugs by refusing to be a puppet, a social plant, a weed suckling on commodities that destroy your consciousness.

155 2018-08-26 02:38:50 Frustrating being an advisor and not being able to say which commodities ETFs will soon be rulers of the free world.

157 2018-08-26 02:30:05 While being venerated as a living symbol of freedom, life, liberty, and  the pursuit of happiness, he consistently and without guilt denied those precious commodities to others, notably Native Americans and innocent civilians in war-torn Arab countries.

So, fuck him.
158 2018-08-26 02:14:56 There are so many things to bother in this country - petrol diesel prices, increased rates of al essential commodities, no new jobs for youngsters etc. Bother on that rather than your cheap politics. Fed up
159 2018-08-26 01:56:29 Food should not be free.
Commodities should not be free.
Instead, labor with fair wages that sustains your commodity should be free.

Magtrabaho ka para mabuhay. That's the rule of labor.
160 2018-08-26 01:53:25 And that sex workers have no right to choose clients. They ofcause  have a right to choose who they work with.
They are not commodities, they are people doing a job, they can choose not to service some clients
161 2018-08-26 01:50:15 White girls on Facebook talking about how good prison inmates have it and are so entitled to basic commodities in reference to the prison strikes going on are so amazing to behold.
162 2018-08-26 01:48:40 It is indeed. For the last of commodities I needed I had to travel out from the center of The Bubble to Nogambe which is beside Deciat. I groaned inwardly, then checked how many jumps it was: 3!
163 2018-08-26 01:48:34 I am speaking of the Cubs trades. Fowler, Arrieta, and Hendricks were not known commodities. Quintana and Chapman were, and I think he overpaid on both deals. Murphy and Hamels were different situations and worth  taking a chance.
164 2018-08-26 01:38:20 Devers didn't have the value Moncada did at the time. Not close. And Theo didn't overpay for Beckett and Schilling, both known commodities. Murphy is a known commodity, Dexter Fowler was... probably a few I missed. When you make as many moves as he has, you'll miss a lot too
165 2018-08-26 01:34:17 The corporate definition of love is obsessed with commodities, property, and hoarding of things and experiences.
166 2018-08-26 01:18:35 Free market for all agri commodities,no interference whatsoever from govt,thats all needed by the Indian farmers...
167 2018-08-26 01:16:11 The macro playbook:

US import tariffs => foreign currencies weaken => dollar  => gold & commodities  in dollar terms

Fed rate hikes => dollar  => same result as above

QT (quantitative tightening) => dollar supply shrinks => dollar  => same result as above
168 2018-08-26 01:12:35 Drugs do not relax you, they turn you into a consumptive addict who relies on commodities to remain socially functional.
169 2018-08-26 00:59:23 Hahaha what hot commodities??  baler threw a spark n strong tail wind by time I got out was at back of tractor already...
170 2018-08-26 00:42:25 #ARV has all approvals in place, and is about to bolt on the gold plant ready process material. Cash on hand, drilling, multiple JORC resources close to the plant. When this commodities bull market swings, ARV will benefit tremendously IMO. #Copper #Zinc #Nickel #Cobalt #Gold
171 2018-08-26 00:42:00 Regulating Elf commodities is notoriously difficult.
172 2018-08-26 00:39:12 The entire commodities space has been retracing for many months now, when the tide turns they will all move higher together! Next bull market swing will be impressive, especially for lithium plays#AVZ #AGY #Lithium even #KDR is getting hammered. Huge upside to all!
173 2018-08-26 00:36:16 If this is backed by gold, with gold being one of the biggest commodities in the world, I can't see why $dig can't eventually hit $100 per coin
174 2018-08-26 00:28:26 I think all the necessary commodities can already be obtained freely. Water's kind of all over the place, there are many charities providing food, homeless shelters already exist. Most of the necessities are already free. I believe healthcare should be free to some extent (pt 1)
175 2018-08-26 00:15:49 If human rights were left to the market human beings would become commodities.

177 2018-08-25 23:40:23 We’re on the same boat but I stop arguing with him, my friend made me realised that I need to “sabay” or respect my father opinion coz I am still living with them. But now i feel he is not like before i bet he already feel hows our basic commodities prices rose up. :D
178 2018-08-25 23:15:37 Wait...how's that going to work? Are they just going to toss their commodities over the wall?
179 2018-08-25 23:13:10 Good day. 
Do you know the allocation to commodities markets, especially agricultural commodities? 
Best Regards.
180 2018-08-25 23:00:02 Gold and silver, like other commodities, have an intrinsic value, which is not arbitrary, but is dependent on their scarcity.
181 2018-08-25 22:53:53 Eu estive num evento sobre commodities e a percepção geral é que o preço de médio prazo para Oil é menor, por causa do crescimento de produção nos EUA. Qual o preço que viabilizou o terceiro equipamento?
182 2018-08-25 22:45:30 So you want a socialist state where you pay 90% taxes? Nothing’s free. Someone’s gotta get paid to give you such commodities.
183 2018-08-25 22:43:06 Socialist-market doesn't mean gov't owns means of production, however there are careful restrictions in terms of prices, monopolies, etc., on products that aren't commodities.
184 2018-08-25 22:37:27 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
185 2018-08-25 22:29:05 Lord Sugar, I have an idea for a new tv show, in a similar vein to the apprentice, with you as the "Figurehead", where around 12 participants are given £10,000 by your company to invest as they see fit. Some would trade on stocks/currencies/commodities on an online platform  (1)
186 2018-08-25 22:20:47 You think that socialism is going to save the earth but yet like most Americans you probably enjoy the commodities of target or shopping malls right? These ideas are so fucking far out it blows my mind that Americans come up with them sitting in $100+ outfits etc
187 2018-08-25 22:12:07 Security Clearances are valued commodities. Why else the uproar, if money (lots of) wasn’t involved? Plenty of proof is available, but your tirade was entertaining.
188 2018-08-25 22:11:43 SDR could even become a peg for commodities. Maybe. But that still doesn’t make it a replacement to the global USD function. Those functions will be broken up amongst different stake holders to help balance the monetary system.
189 2018-08-25 22:05:03 3252: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
190 2018-08-25 21:58:25 Oil Proof of work. Gold proof of work. Natural gas proof of work. All commodities proof of work. And combined they use more ENERGY than bitcoin. In the scheme of things bitcoin is tiny to energy consumption. I mean tiny. 1/2 of electricity globally is off grid

193 2018-08-25 21:44:31 Massive shortfall in supply will meet expanding demand for Uranium. I just love unloved commodities. It is always where the money is made and this time around it is going to be a blockbuster. Not going to miss this one.

Truth, and compassion Are extremely Rare commodities.

Worth enough to by Asheville.

I just Showed some compassion to a Friend, and Shared the truth.

213 2018-08-25 21:37:01 I can't imagine it takes 10% of global electricity to transport, store and secure Gold. Cuz if that's the case then we have so many other minerals and commodities we extract transport and secure so much more than Gold....
214 2018-08-25 21:21:37 #FixAProblemIn4Words Commodities should be free
215 2018-08-25 21:20:05 I was, then, collecting the betrayed pieces of my constitution

I got a job
and bought commodities and was adventuring myself
and looking at the world out there
while I was in here

and she was in there
and I painted my face
one side a star, the other, a raindrop
216 2018-08-25 21:05:41 I would go to work at wall street back in the 80s and invested heavily in the Colombian commodities market.
217 2018-08-25 21:03:25 Trades what?  Is he a trader?  I'm sure he own stocks and bonds. Maybe commodities.
218 2018-08-25 20:57:32 Do you think this is related  the drop in commodities prices over the last five months, or so? Or nah?
219 2018-08-25 20:50:29 Are you no ashemed to lie all that much?
There are more than 500 pages of proves of Lula's crimes.
And, again, Brazil only selled commodities to China. It is that makes our economy good for some time. Then PT stealed from people and now Brazil faces a recession.
220 2018-08-25 20:33:38 We will be accepting applications to our international cryptocurrency fund.

221 2018-08-25 20:33:16 Turn luxuries into commodities, and commodities into signaling goods. They’re easy to verify...
222 2018-08-25 20:23:36 The only representation lesbian women get in films/media is fetishised as sex objects or disparaged as “butch” because they aren’t valuable commodities for men’s sexual pleasure it’s so fucked and I’m so sick of it.
223 2018-08-25 20:10:40 has any leader ever imagined to remodel and better the value of kenya currency by even a smaller percentage as we compare   with other currencies? will we achieve this by  goon economists who rapidly shoot up prices of different commodities?
224 2018-08-25 20:05:39 De acuerdo q hay posibilidad de reducción de los costos en f(demanda,precios, etc) pero el margen de maniobra es reducido, por costos estructurales como de contratación de L, costos intl como commodities (ej trigo para pan). Bajada considerable de precios no sería sostenible Slds
225 2018-08-25 19:58:02 Buy here,commodities? No , sell here SPY !
226 2018-08-25 19:38:48 These are just to move commodities to ports to their country
227 2018-08-25 19:38:33 propongo che l'immigrato africano sia quotato in borsa fra le commodities.
la cosa è (semi)seria.
ma non troppo.
228 2018-08-25 19:29:42 This is hilarious!!! In all seriousness though make sure to reinvest any crypto profits wisely! There is speculation that housing is an overpriced market and things like commodities (metals, energy, agriculture) is underpriced! The markets are anyone's guess but diversify!
229 2018-08-25 19:24:12 And for the record, the very best Peanut Butter in existence is made by the USDA Commodities program.

230 2018-08-25 19:11:51 boa tarde

posso escrever um artigo do ponto de vista do produtor de cafes commodities e de cafes especiais.
Tem interesse?
231 2018-08-25 19:01:52 Clarito, lamentablemente muchísima gente no logra entender eso. Tampoco entienden que el crecimiento económico que tuvimos en esta última década se dió mayoritariamente gracias a que aumentaron tremendamente los precios de los commodities (soja especialmente) y gracias a China.
232 2018-08-25 19:00:33 So for commodities BEs do serve as a floor, although prices do fall below breakevens and corrections take time => thus the commodities boom & bust cycle.

For BTC BEs can serve as (temporary) floor as no miner wants to shut off. It's a matter of survival and emotional attachment.
233 2018-08-25 18:59:22 Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk (2016). Soldiers fresh off fighting in Iraq are treated as commodities at football game. Saw this on tv, so not as the director intended. As a movie this has strong flashes, but it gets actory and obvious too often. 6/10
234 2018-08-25 18:57:09 Commodities => Price drops below BE => miners shut production off => less supply => less inventory => price bounces (big a prolonged lag).

Bitcoin is different => Price drops below breakeven => miners shut production off => less hashing power => lower difficulty => same supply
235 2018-08-25 18:51:00 1) The stock, commodities and futures markets are manipulated by hedge funds, Wall Street, algos and even politicians.  

Crypto is largely for the people by the people.  Who you gonna trust?  The future of money is digital, transparent and de-centralized.  #bitcoin #altcoins
236 2018-08-25 18:49:01 She sees the millions this kind of cruelty has generated for Coulter and the like, and she's trying to get hers. Hatred, depravity, cruelty, racism and volatility are hot commodities that keep bank accounts well fed.
237 2018-08-25 18:42:00 Not entirely true for all commodities. As corn farmers and ethanol producers in the US demonstrated it’s an outright subsidy. So, yes it’s not a free market.
238 2018-08-25 18:41:48 ok ..I find 588 also a important level .., whats ur feeling about Monday.. I think that metal pack should rally again seeing the metal commodities rally late last evening/night yesterday
239 2018-08-25 18:23:25 Colonialism was a crime against humanity but of what use is Independence if your kin still enslaves and dehumanizes you? Not to talk of having much lesser to eat and zero commodities for living?

I swear to you that sex with a man is one of the cheapest commodities on the Ghanaian market,  in fact it's free.Ghanaian society has encouraged men to be promiscuous and promiscuous they most certainly are. Offering and asking for sex at every juncture.
241 2018-08-25 18:07:34 Me: can you believe this! The government has decided that prices of household commodities will once again increase

Patel: (shocked) vat?
242 2018-08-25 18:06:55 Sir if I may say hang sang charts would also be good indicators for commodities turnaround. As well way hindalco has held up despite copper falling looks something is cooking in commodities.
243 2018-08-25 18:01:19 Art is a byproduct of taste, which is not merely discrimination between art commodities (a la geek culture) but a mode of Being in the World.
244 2018-08-25 18:00:10 In Ian‘s mind women are commodities for the purpose of sex.
245 2018-08-25 17:58:20 No,simplemente es coincidencia.
El ciclo 2022,es el final decreciente emergente.
El q anticipé en 2011 que habia dado inicios el crash ciclico emergente, con una etapa primera de caída econ, rebote x estímulos, y 4 últimos años CRISIS FINANCIERA.Ese mismo ciclo es de commodities
246 2018-08-25 17:55:23 No need to worry. Médecins Sans Frontières will air-drop medicines & the Yanks do a Berlin airlift re-run. Refugees will seek refuge elsewhere, their traffickers smuggle commodities instead, & our Fishermen will have the time of their lives as the fishless EU looks enviously on.
247 2018-08-25 17:42:28 Where are they located? How many youths are employed and are well paid in these industries?? What commodities are these industries producing? What roads has he started completed?
248 2018-08-25 17:23:43 Ah, but the problem being bankers are running the world.
Boiling everything down to commodities, killing people’s souls, separating children from their familiars, makes robots of us all.
A reductionist mechanistic existence is a sterile one & no life at all.
249 2018-08-25 17:15:35 Duhalde: “en 2002 salimos de la crisis en 6 meses, no entiendo qué pasa ahora”. Hijo de puta! Devaluaste 200 % (1 a 3), se te duplicó el presupuesto por el boom de los commodities, congelaste el gasto, pesificaste, no tenias que pagar deuda ni AUH ni pensiones no contributivas!!!
250 2018-08-25 17:12:29 2 years back i used to get commodities and vegetables with lesser price now you are saying 5% please tell which commodities are available with lesser price than 5 years back or tell to common and middle class what you have achieved during last 4 years only publicity
251 2018-08-25 17:10:14 Sempre é pelo long. Na maioria dos períodos de porrada nas commodities, o S&P tbem sobe, só q muito menos, às vezes até gica de lado. Vi trecho a trecho dessa curva o q acontece.
252 2018-08-25 17:10:03 I get people saying I operate on loose definitions of a lot of Marx's terms.

I would ask people to simply consider the idea of more things as commodities. If you can see more abstract ideas as commodities, you should be able to see exactly what I'm doing.
253 2018-08-25 17:08:57 False, eg Au+Ag+Cu
..Currency is debt (w/monetary collateral backing it), a “contract standard” solving for liquidity & transaction costs of varying collateral behind it (gold, real estate, resource rents,PP&E..). Bearer money (tokens, metals)can be multiple competing commodities
254 2018-08-25 16:57:29 @UKenyatta kindly  save Kenyans from 16% fuel vat,The burden is alrdy too mch, commodities wil b hiked bt the wages remain the same.
255 2018-08-25 16:57:03 All you girls are COMMODITIES. You let these guys in just to find out they’re nothing more to y’all than an ACCESSORY.
256 2018-08-25 16:51:17 Making a profit out of poison in medicines, fertilizers, food.  We are the commodities in turbocapitalism.
257 2018-08-25 16:41:02 Safer by rail than pipeline?? Proven answer is NO!  Utilize pipelines for oil. Grain and other commodities need the rails.
258 2018-08-25 16:30:10 Más allá de los problemas de corrupción que afectan a la region, sería bueno entender la relación entre el crecimiento de china y amlat, considerando el impacto en el $ de los commodities que afecta mayoritariamente a chile y Peru

260 2018-08-25 16:05:50 You continue to misinform people. Real rulers are all post graduates by the time they reach the level of ruling; so called  highly qualified but stupid idiots, cheats, liars & saleable commodities like you.

262 2018-08-25 15:54:02 Soñé que me daba unos besos con el vicuña, tras mucha insistencia de su parte.
Total los sueños no son commodities....yet.
263 2018-08-25 15:47:42 List of rare commodities: diamonds, tritium, anti matter, key lime La Croix.
264 2018-08-25 15:45:37 I think the idea is that China is using this period to demonstrate to trading partners that the price of commodities in Yuan offers them a stable business environment? Business thrives on stability.
265 2018-08-25 15:34:26 @hbredda e a correlação entre commodities vs. Renda Variável no Brasil...
266 2018-08-25 15:33:36 Inflation is one of the causes of rising prices of basic goods and commodities...

Pero tumataba pa din ako.
267 2018-08-25 15:32:18 A big thank you to @visualcap for ongoing coverage of #copper, #gold, and other #commodities.
268 2018-08-25 15:24:02 Que puedan serlo a) no valida el resto de supuestos fantasmagóricos y absurdos
ni b) el modelo reconce que solo en ciertos bienes hay algo de homogeneidad (algo, porque cercanía y otros diferenciadores no desaparecen *ni* en commodities).
269 2018-08-25 15:19:08 Bienes pueden ser homogéneos. Productos agrícolas, commodities y hasta productos elaborados como chips dram por ejemplo. Perf conocimiento es más difícil, pero no es inhumano. Puede suceder, y seguro en algunos micro-ambientes de competencia, sucede.
270 2018-08-25 15:16:34 Right. This would imply the recent developments on steriods: Increasing scarcity of USD, all currencies devalued against it, a real EM crisis with commodities and EM currencies way down, ie a deflationary shock?
271 2018-08-25 15:02:45 Let me repeat this, there is no such thing as "fair trade". African farmers cannot compete against American & European farmers who grow the same commodities, but receive $100 billions in farm subsidies from their governments.
272 2018-08-25 15:01:16 Commodities are a great way to invest in China, India and global demand. Find your favourite commodity and buy some.
273 2018-08-25 14:58:59 Why shld we do that, the government is busy increasing prices on all basic commodities, at least they r cheaper
274 2018-08-25 14:55:52 He loses his job we’re totally fucked. Which is another screwed up element of our system. I could rant for days about this uniquely disgusting American problem where people are commodities. 

Hope your family member gets to come home soon.
275 2018-08-25 14:30:24 The Manufacturing sector have used Brexit as an excuse to push up prices of their Commodities. And Britain has not left the EU yet & is still a fully paid up member. @LBC #Brexit.
276 2018-08-25 14:29:19 2019 could be very problematic for ag commodities producers. Funny to me, that Dem controlled Congress may be tasked with bailing them out.
277 2018-08-25 14:23:51 I have a problem with people who discuss macroeconomic trends and outlook for a nation, without taking into consideration geopolitics,  strategic offshore interests, and the movement of commodities into consideration
278 2018-08-25 14:15:52 Our current monetary system actually uses securities, and commodities, rather the futures that these things will become more valuable in the future. Crypto, is based in both of these and has the distinct advantage of having human actionable value as a base.
279 2018-08-25 14:12:37 Crude coming rally coming our way sir is it ?? Commodities about to rally
280 2018-08-25 14:12:04 You cannot win the heart of peoples through austerity measures, unless the common man not benefited through;
Reduce the price of Electricity and Gas; Reduce the prices of petroleum products, reduce the price of daily commodities and strengthen Pak Rupees against Dollar.
281 2018-08-25 14:08:57 Fuel to India not possible. Oil and commodities will rise. Pharma and IT rip. 80% revenue of Indian companies is outside. Eur and gbp to parity first before nosedive. Gold 750. Then in my view $ will do a bungee. Will relook Sir as your views are always great
282 2018-08-25 14:07:23 It's never a bad idea to teach that people have a right to reject romantic advances without fear of physical assault. Maybe it will help men to see women as people and not commodities, with hopefully the byproduct of fewer women being attacked and/or killed.
283 2018-08-25 14:05:08 Not all plant milks are, though. Istm that nobody benefits from going head to head on these issues. Many of us are  trying to feel our way forward for a more earth friendly way of life and many farm animals are treated as commodities.
284 2018-08-25 14:05:04 3171: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
285 2018-08-25 13:48:32 I’ve dealt with all commodities for years.  They always pick up their contracts usually wait till the very very end of the contact date.
286 2018-08-25 13:43:15 Difficulty adjusts with hashing power - both up and down. Which results in no "hard BE floor". Bitcoin's break-even is more flexible than physical commodities break-evens.
287 2018-08-25 13:39:24 Reading news about crisis in Venezuela and im still dropping my jaw when i remember unreasoneable price of the commodities, such as
2.4kg chicken> 14.6 million Bolivar= only $2.2
1kg tomato> 5 million Bolivar= only $0.76
288 2018-08-25 13:29:23 In America people are commodities not humans- and they are sold propaganda not educated or informed- they are prescribed not healed - the goal is not to have a good and loving life but to make your nut and look down on everyone else.
289 2018-08-25 13:19:10 This is funny. Shouldn't be, but it is. Here too, where they all think they are farmers (with their 20 acres of grapes or almonds, no kitchen table food, just commodities for profit).
290 2018-08-25 13:18:30 i only remember bc its the topic i did the best in because i could talk about marx and commodities and a really interesting theory i read about as the cycle of commodification
291 2018-08-25 13:18:20 A game where you are worn down by bureaucracy, by people treating each other as commodities, by the futility of it all.
292 2018-08-25 13:17:13 Although the S&P's closed at a new high breakout it is obvious that commodities are taken for free on the bid and are soon to roar back up.
Anyone with binoculars can see flocks of black swans coming in to roost
293 2018-08-25 13:07:18 @SriSri Kerala is thankful for your 500 tonne Twitter transfer of all commodities. Congrats next time please do send across real stuff! Even Srisri don’t fear his god....
294 2018-08-25 12:55:21 No, they haven't resolved to become great. Talk like this doesn't push people to greatness. 

They have accepted that women will never love them for themselves. They are calmly accepting that women only see them as commodities and adjusting accordingly.. 
It's a problem.
295 2018-08-25 12:42:35 There is nothing new or unusual about the USDA buying farm commodities to redistribute. The USDA's National School Lunch Program has been a major recipient of USDA redistributed farm commodities for decades.
296 2018-08-25 12:42:18 Mis Sheri ur tenure from 2008 to 14 was the wrst of all tenures in terms of terrorism, bad econony, drone attacks and regular increase in the prices of petrol and all commodities of life.  What a shame for u
297 2018-08-25 12:35:23 The common mwananchi is suffering, what is this building and change are you bringing, isn't it for your own, the rich benefit, petrol prices and that of basic commodities is increasing by first, while your always singing change. May God grant you wisdom!
298 2018-08-25 12:17:00 La realidad es que robaron todo
La realidad es que cuando Argentina tuvo una oportunidad histórica con el precio de los commodities los demás paiese cuatriplicaron las reservas y acá terminamos con un cepo
Destruyeron la matriz energética y se perdieron 400.000 puestos de trabajo
299 2018-08-25 12:08:17 Not sure what is meant by an ‘Asimov psychohistorian’, I’ll hazard an educated guess: the success of ‘markets has always been dependent on two key factors (the transformation of raw materials &labour cost to produce commodities aside): compression of Time/Space+tech innovation ??
300 2018-08-25 12:01:16 Sure they can write it off whenever they want and run the same playbook again, but at what exchange rate? Going to be ever more expensive to procure commodities and hard currency if you go that route. Laws of economic gravity still matter and wasteful spending can’t be sustained
301 2018-08-25 11:47:41 “Opinions are the cheapest commodities on earth.” Don’t be easily influenced but the opinions of others.
302 2018-08-25 11:44:31 O brasileiro não entende de macro economia, esse VAGABUNDO @LulaOficial apenas surfou na onda das commodities! Golpe desagradável seria se esse pulha fosse solto! O desespero bate à porta e vcs estão aniquilados.. Mas democracia é isso, vc ainda poderá escrever tuas asneiras
303 2018-08-25 11:39:29 Yes, the establishment would have people believe the CO2 lie. Anyway, I became interested recently as I follow very closely the price of commodities.
304 2018-08-25 11:29:55 I have been imaging the lengths he will go. It's not a pretty picture. He was so comfortable putting babies in cages, I wonder what his interest was in Russian " adoptions". He has no concern for children, only Commodities.
305 2018-08-25 11:06:41 It is only the consequence of China's expansion.
China buys commodities from Brazil at rates never seen before.
306 2018-08-25 11:04:58 No, it isn't.
We just "surf" on China's expansion, sell commodities to them.
Lula uses his influence to personal gains and the justice track his corruption. It is 12 justice process until this moment.
307 2018-08-25 10:41:26 Kenya was the country to stay in during the 80s and 90s, the cost of living was lower and basic commodities affordable, the only snag was political assasinations which we still witness even today,
I miss president Moi
Kabarak
308 2018-08-25 10:39:22 OK. Hmmm. I hardly think anybody should spend time on/in single stocks unless it's a hobby. Global stocks and commodities index investing is best för most. Right now, however stocks are historically very high [something] and thus unusually risky. I don't own public stocks.
309 2018-08-25 10:36:36 Errata: buy commodities AND SHORT S&P
310 2018-08-25 10:34:29 Now is the time to learn to say grace before meals.Thank God for the food on your table and please don't waste rice & viand anymore.Lots of people are going to bed hungry.
Whether you like it or not,you have to adjust to the rising prices of commodities.That or you drown in debt.
311 2018-08-25 10:30:16 #Siddhgiri #KeralaFloodsRelief It’s a great job done by #Siddhgiri Math under the leadership of PP Adrushya Swamji providing medical, essential commodities and cloths at the interior districts affected people due to Kerala flood
312 2018-08-25 10:24:32 Madam, how hard you try you can’t hypnotise the Indian public against Modi, majority of Indians are with him Inspite of  demonetisation, and his failure to curb on  rising prices of commodities, he will be re elected again in 2019
313 2018-08-25 10:20:25 The LNP rabid, insular Racist vacuum,  where people are commodities or Pawns either way it’s wrong ,dead wrong.
314 2018-08-25 10:18:18 Prices of basic commodities and hoarding of daily consumables on the rise - - just few hours after announcement of concourt ruling - -
315 2018-08-25 10:12:14 YAAHUB will immediately process its application REGULATED authorites but there is as of no rule of any sort but a fair system that can work to exchange services and commodities at service of people in the real world. #Yaahub #ico #cryptocurrency #noorcoin
316 2018-08-25 10:00:06 All western nations are incorporated so it’s pretty much in all these nations. We are nothing but eating machines and using up their resouces but we sure do make a ton of $$ since the governments trade us on the stock market. We are commodities to the - Slaves.
317 2018-08-25 09:57:42 Look we have farm attacks on a daily bases. But it's because farmers and farm workers are easy targets. The issue is our government does not deem it necessary to protect one of our most precious commodities. Easy to speak from across the pond.
318 2018-08-25 09:56:57 Hear! Hear! Children aren't commodities to be traded in the market place. Surely it's time for central government to intervene in 'the market' & ensure principles of Children Act 1989 are placed before 'value for money' & we stop moving kids miles from home for economic reasons
319 2018-08-25 09:53:13 What is disturbing is that so many agree with his view and RT him. He is not just a twitter freak but your average product of an Patriarchal education system and society that treat women as commodities of honor and morality.
320 2018-08-25 09:53:11 "I don't like this movie because I've tied my identity to all the commodities in my life and this criticizes that" is always a strong argument against capitalism.
321 2018-08-25 09:52:57 Commodities are often referred to as the 5th Asset Class, after the conventional investment asset classes of cash, fixed interest securities, equities and property....keep reading more...
322 2018-08-25 09:37:27 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
323 2018-08-25 09:20:23 Farmers try something new today and make sure ALL your employees aren’t being cunts 

Every little helps your commodities live a shit life  slightly better

325 2018-08-25 08:59:15 Central Goverment should take a decision like Maharashtra Goverment for the denial for Sales of all commodities below Minimum Support Price, Otherwise looking at the current scenario, there will be an imbalance of trade in the nation.
@CMOGuj @PMOIndia @ChouhanShivraj
326 2018-08-25 08:41:16 Agreed, don't know why we're constantly treated like freaks or the butt of jokes, a lot of the most widely used commodities on Earth were made by autistic people.
327 2018-08-25 08:36:24 Bia Nwoke'm! Go & sit down! Why r the prices of commodities higher once u cross d naija bridge? Igbos & their greed! The moment u speak igbo to an igbo trader in d market in lagos... That's when they hike the price & give u nonsense! Brotherhood my foot!
328 2018-08-25 08:01:27 September is nearly open us . Commodities staging a rally last week . Plenty of news awaited on majority of holds I can see it being a very strong run up to Christmas . My oil and gas plays in Focus next week #RBD #CORO #CASP #INFA
329 2018-08-25 07:56:18 We are very good at budgeting, and also equally good at misappropriation of the budgeted funds. The Asian tigers grew their economy by focusing on the informal sector but not by taxing basic goods and commodities like CS ROTICH #amliventv @debarlinea @ntvkenya
330 2018-08-25 07:40:54 Shuwa we struggling to buy electricity and prices of basic commodities are sky rocketing and some bitch is busy making noise over trivia......
331 2018-08-25 07:35:10 Computers need to return to the time when buying one was a major financial decision for a few thousand dollars

People now treat them as disposable commodities thanks to Dell, HP, Toshiba, and Acer

Disgusting
332 2018-08-25 07:25:03 Gold - unlike other commodities - usually exists in contango, rather than backwardation [considered the natural state of commodities]- but because of readily available inventory; demand for gold and bitcoin can be sated immediately; disambiguating 'futures' pricing.
333 2018-08-25 07:07:07 Instead of behaving irresponsibly and irrationally by raising fuel and other essential commodities prices to increase revenue, Tobacco and alcoholic products should be taxed heavily. Kenya needs a responsive and responsible treasury and Parliament.

336 2018-08-25 06:38:41 Even the poorest of the poorest will be affected. Anytime fuel prices go up basic commodities will go up so its not just the 'middle class' who by the way they say may be just about 1million people. We are all going to be victims of these bad jubilee policies
337 2018-08-25 06:30:40 Bank charges have gone up to pay civil servants 
Basic commodities prices are going up and no money to buy 
Are we going to get from president  as presidential  scheme

344 2018-08-25 05:36:21 The more you consume, the less you live. Commodities are the opium of the people.
345 2018-08-25 05:14:09 They live in a make believe world. In a Faustian bargain they have sold their soul to the Satan. They r ensuring realization of Biblical prophesy of numbering every human beings & turning them into purchasble commodities with the Mark of the Beast.  #destroy UID/Aadhaar
346 2018-08-25 05:02:52 It’s just like any other industry predicated  on animal exploitation, they are mere  commodities.
347 2018-08-25 04:46:54 Yesterday I watched Slave Route on Aljezeera. Black Slaves documentary. What I saw left me sobbing. How many black people were relegated into commodities & slaves? stripped naked of thier humanity. Sold forcefully hackled with chains on wrists, kness and angles as slaves. Painful
348 2018-08-25 04:01:49 There was a day when if Chicago wanted to trade it was commodities and it was not a gamble.
349 2018-08-25 03:53:00 WallSt traders, living on price swings in commodities are are themselves becoming commodities. Human dealmakers are losing jobs, replaced by AI machines with computer algorithms that react & trade millions of times in a tearful blink. Keeping our eyes closed won't make it stop.
350 2018-08-25 03:52:23 Will commodities go up or the S&P go down, this is the real question. I’m betting on a breakthrough with Chinese trade talks, this will put a rocket up commodities and hopefully get some momentum happening! Come on Trumpy!

352 2018-08-25 03:35:05 Exactly. The current price perspective makes me feel like a simultaneous selloff will not be as deep in commodities as other sectors. To me, I see so little downside risk, even though it's still possible.

The ratio is ridiculous. It says leave emotion behind and buy.
353 2018-08-25 03:27:10 tava aqui pensando... se o Lula (mesmo preso) for eleito de novo, não vai conseguir nem metade doq fez no seu primeiro governo:
o dólar n vai cair de novo
nem as commodities vão subir
tb n vai ter aquela abundância de crédito

ele vai ter que enfrentar a crise que ele mesmo criou

356 2018-08-25 02:51:48 2) the majority's concerns, and the need it feels to perhaps stretch 6(b)(5) authority. The gap between securities and commodities market regulation - into which bitcoin particularly falls - leaves both sets of regulators with a real lack of information from their normal sources.
357 2018-08-25 02:45:31 Thanks for the follow Commodities London @commoditieslon
358 2018-08-25 02:34:00 They should not be speculative commodities for sale internationally to people who only want to store value. Check out China. That’s where we’re importing demand from. And they don’t allow foreigners to own except with strict regulation. Unlevel playing field. But you endorse it.

Today they FELL when most other commodities ROSE as the DXY fell. Speaks volumes imho.
363 2018-08-25 01:20:07 Just like how Jamaicans dont want foreigners selling coffee in Jamaica, why dont we all have that nationalist view on everything .... chicken, sugar, water, drinks and food. #NoManIsAnIsland #NoManStandsAlone we all need other countries and other commodities. #TeamJamaica
364 2018-08-25 01:19:48 Look, according to me the same rules apply to all commodities and hence I see (and saw) an asset bubble. You don’t agree, that’s fine. You spend your monies, and I’ll spend mine.

372 2018-08-25 00:15:00 I'm quite surprised .@realDonaldTrump has NOT learned that TREATING PEOPLE like COMMODITIES (to use, abuse, & discard) WILL COME BACK to haunt & damage .@POTUS !

373 2018-08-25 00:14:45 China likely isn't doing it for leverage. Commodities like soy, metals, dairy are all at Chinese scale, easier to get in the Pacific as opposed to US/Brazil/Argentina and transpacific shipping. I agree that China will squeeze Pacific neighbors. I'm just not sure this is how

410 2018-08-24 21:10:54 that's absurd, it's called investing, when the asset grows in value, you investors who bought in at a lower price make money - if what you said was true and it's 100% not, it would be the same as calling all stocks, bonds, derivatives, gold, all commodities, blah blah a ponzi too
411 2018-08-24 21:06:26 @NGRPresident the monopoly of commodities like cement is a monumental corruption and need to be checked
412 2018-08-24 20:31:11 I agree that it sets a solid precedent, but I also hate the idea that they cut costs by dealing low cost relievers with higher priced commodities and then pay out $1.25 million to those two. But yeah, I don't think it was intentional by Ned.
413 2018-08-24 20:19:50 Agree. They are called fundamentals for a reason & I think unless you're trading something where fundamentals can't be well understood (like forex / commodities) it's essential to kick the tires rather than rely solely on technical analysis as a buy / sell case
414 2018-08-24 20:16:43 As exchange rate yes. But I believe that actual increase in commodities prices and products / services did not change that much. Thx to the gov printed prices on most items there is a strong monitor in the market. Plus major companies cannot increase prices without gov approval.

416 2018-08-24 20:07:16 Every fund not 100% in SPY that has any diversification into EM, Bonds, Currencies or Commodities is very, very far from an all-time high.

428 2018-08-24 18:54:32 There was an immediate financial impact.  The pound going from $1.50 to $1.30 increased the price of many imported goods - particularly oil which is priced in dollars, as well as many commodities.

474 2018-08-24 16:39:39 How about you look it up, & as you’re reading the definition, read it from the perspective of a nation. Not a company, not a commodities trader, nor a bookish economist. Take a holistic Canadian view on the entire lifecycle of oil production, then do the math on opportunity cost.
475 2018-08-24 16:32:55 Eventually innovation ends in splitting hairs ever finer.

And many commodities are finite resources.

All systems in the universe are limited by some law or scarcity.

479 2018-08-24 16:12:27 It’s not a perfect solution. Literally nothing is when there’s scarcity (which is always). But taken as a whole, prices do gage need (or more accurately, willing demand)very well because typically there’s many people involved in bidding on the prices of many commodities

493 2018-08-24 15:33:02 WallSt traders, living on price swings in commodities are are themselves becoming commodities.

580 2018-08-24 09:21:17 How about agreeing that true & fair views are not commodities to be bid for?
581 2018-08-24 09:17:37 I'm not even really referring to the strategy. It's nuts compared with public finances anywhere, at any time. A surplus of close to 3% of GDP without a commodities boom is just crazy hard to find anywhere else.
582 2018-08-24 09:01:41 Speaking of oligarchs,don't they have a hand in the high prices of basic commodities and the rice shortage happening now?Everyday,price of rice goes up.Ang sikmurang kumakalam ay mas madali udyukan upang magsimula ng kaguluhan.
583 2018-08-24 09:01:20 True talk... They should first tell their parents that they are not commodities.... No bride price, then share wedding expenses 50/50.   
584 2018-08-24 08:57:30 Hate makes a man blind. He does not realize that local taxes can not be imposed on export commodities. Shd other countries impose local taxes on crude exported to India?

Also lower taxes on fossil fuel r bad for environment and benefit rich & middle class more than poor.
585 2018-08-24 08:53:35 Also you don’t think slavery, a process by which folks are *literally* treated as commodities, wouldn’t lead at all lead to the idea children are property to be controlled to avoid violence? Nothing exists in a vacuum...
586 2018-08-24 08:42:42 With the inflation rate going crazy,the rice shortage especially added to the fact that massive cheating has been exposed in the recount,what do we have?People who are complaining.With high prices of commodities, unrest is not impossible then armed conflict.

600 2018-08-24 06:42:10 Prices of basic commodities have shot up significantly over the past month as retailers responded to rising inflationary pressures, stemming from a depreciating local currency, foreign currency shortages and excess liquidity in the economy.#ZimIndependent
601 2018-08-24 06:38:28 The government cartels work to ensure cost of local production remains high making imported products cheaper. With more imports in almost all basic commodities, the local farmer has no agricultural ambition.Arable land now turned into real estates.
602 2018-08-24 06:26:56 U.S., China swap tariffs on billions in commodities. What is wrong if a country levies  higher import duties to protect domestic industry?

618 2018-08-24 04:42:01 I don't even understand the position. Americans have the right to healthcare as much as they have the right to other commodities.  

You just have to pay for it
619 2018-08-24 04:41:50 Actually it has to do with the dollar(currency) market.  Policies that are rare attractive (tariffs etc) push the dollar up and push commodities down.  Until the currency market perceives tariffs are priced in dollar (and commodities will fall) will continue to rise.

635 2018-08-24 03:02:51 Hinduism teaches that mothers are 1000 times more worthy of respect and worship than fathers.

642 2018-08-24 02:13:38 Small move in dollar = large move in commodities, but does it apply in both directions?
643 2018-08-24 02:11:46 Market Update - Down, down, prices are down. Another night where futures resemble a Coles marketing campaign for all commodities.  Luckily the red on the AUD should offset the small falls in wheat.

656 2018-08-24 00:32:10 Prices go up to stop people from over consuming in a time of need. It is a form of rationing. It should not be illegal to raise prices on commodities during a natural disaster. As it signals to those entrepreneurs to get the commodity delivered as quickly as is possible.
