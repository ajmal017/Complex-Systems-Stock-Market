7 2018-07-25 23:57:31 This kind of reckless greed is going to get America in the middle of another financial meltdown. All of these buybacks on stocks costing a lot of money that could've been used to help workers. Enough is enough. We need common sense wall st. regulation.

9 2018-07-25 23:56:16 It’s probably time to get out of stocks if Wilbur Ross has decided it’s time to sell and he can’t make more money from his insider trading. Also, this take is 100% right on.

41 2018-07-25 23:51:45 You’d think. But here’s the real kicker. There is no win.
In fact stockpiling might be the best bit.
Hurry while stocks last.
42 2018-07-25 23:51:06 Can you miss an already preannounced quarter... despite the fundermentals I will be very curious to watch the action in the charts in the coming days/next week if the stocks are higher regardless on a bad news bottom.

48 2018-07-25 23:46:38 Both stocks were up big, $FB up 40% since #DeleteFacebook. If Netflix didn’t beat expectations by 10% their stock would be down. Stock market is very very expensive right now.

74 2018-07-25 23:29:45 The US conversation is different as far as I understand. Quite a few middle aged Americans are fine with handguns but want stricter regulations to ban bump stocks / auto & semi-auto guns. Allowing you to have a handgun is not preventing you to exercise the right to bear arms

96 2018-07-25 23:23:52 Facebook is currently trading down 17%. This is why trading is so risky these days when the stock market is so high. Who is next in the FAANG stocks?

107 2018-07-25 23:18:12 (1/2) WRT the $FB meltdown, there's nothing new under the investing sun. The near-universal analyst acclaim for a handful of stocks, bubble-icious price gains for said stocks, obsessive media coverage, disregard for valuations, etc. is just like the late 90s "TMT" obsession.
108 2018-07-25 23:16:27 .. the $3 rise in price of the last month was apparently due to CCJ pressure but I saw no UxC notes on such buys.  So, I am disappointed and this explains why the stocks did little in the last few days.  I expect little action 2 morrow or negative action but who knows?

132 2018-07-25 23:00:23 Biggest Stocks dont crash 20 percent in a bull market and neither does the guidance go lower. Hmm Zucky was selling stock for a reason for the last 9 months. He knew
133 2018-07-25 23:00:18 Soon #facebook stocks will not be worth much like many in the past.
134 2018-07-25 23:00:11 conerns w many alts is high pricing and lack of revenue. $WABI at 0.00004xxx is worth about $0.33. Many companies are over-valued Penny Stocks *with zero revenue or customers* - just tech. Who's actually using it? *Not trading any alts during this $btc bull run, am selling alts!
135 2018-07-25 22:59:14 Facebook stock dump could hit ETF's hard tomorrow. $SPY and $QQQ heavily weighted in FAANG stocks
136 2018-07-25 22:58:16 Ebay: Our stocks drop just over 10% ...
FB: Hold my beer
137 2018-07-25 22:58:13 How about a chart outlining how many stocks at the bottom of the S&P 500 have the combined market cap that was lost by $FB?
138 2018-07-25 22:58:06 $fb bringing down the market = more opportunity to buy other stocks for CHEAPER $FB $TSLA $SNAP $NFLX $NVDA $AMZN $QQQ $GOOG $AAPL $MSFT
139 2018-07-25 22:58:01 With the sharp fall in Facebook's results after-hours - approx 20% or $125 billion reduction in the market value of the behemoth Technology company has sentiment changed for the record breaking Nasdaq and FANG stocks? Thursday is going to be a bloodbath for Nasdaq and FANGs.
140 2018-07-25 22:57:30 Stocks: Top 5 in Value all at All-Time Highs today. Apple at around $960 Billion, Amazon $900Bil, Alphabet $870 Bil, Microsoft $840Bil, & Facebook $620Bil.
141 2018-07-25 22:56:46 $FB got slaughtered today; sent shockwaves to all the big tech stocks during after hours trading...
142 2018-07-25 22:56:19 Are you guys buying this dip on $FB ? Feel free to reply with your reasoning!

143 2018-07-25 22:54:37 2018 in a nutshell: 

After hours:   Stocks are DOWN BIG
Pre open:       Stocks are DOWN
Open:              Stocks are Down Slightly
Mid Day:         Stocks are Unchanged
Close:              Stocks are  UP


144 2018-07-25 22:54:28 Stocks represent potential value, not actual value. Lets see him cash out the stock before facebook does a myspace. 
145 2018-07-25 22:53:54 Yeah we should all check to see if he has stocks in Diet Coke
146 2018-07-25 22:52:59 Weeakness in #technology most likely early. Statement by the WH & European's deal should overshadow early weakness. Banks are looking real strong & a lot of Facebook money will be looking for a home. Insurance companies should start to figure in soon. They are lagging . #stocks
147 2018-07-25 22:52:01 $FB highlights the inherent risk that always exists in stocks, especially when you hold into a key report.
148 2018-07-25 22:51:46 “Why didn’t you, Trump, ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?”

153 2018-07-25 22:49:12 All my co's are solid, and I'm short the CRISPR stocks which should take the biggest hit if valuation and risk concerns shake the sector.
154 2018-07-25 22:48:49 SAL.  CNBC JUST REPORTED 2 minutes ago TECH STOCKS SET TO CRATER THURSDAY WITH FACEBOOK LEADING THE PACK
155 2018-07-25 22:48:22 Think I'll also be analyzing Medical device stocks along with LNG stocks tonight.
156 2018-07-25 22:48:12 stocks of Facebook down 24% today alone, Twitter down and they scare me to invest in
157 2018-07-25 22:47:43 When Trump builds the wall, will all of the liberal fund managers dump the stocks that will profit from its construction?
158 2018-07-25 22:47:30 @LBellCFRA Great job with @cvpayne pointing to A LOT of funds all holding a handful of stocks like $FB that could impact far and wide when they explode. (you should be a regular on #MMWCP)  @FoxBusiness
159 2018-07-25 22:45:47 It's typical for other stocks in the same sector to go down as well, even if they are competitors who conceivably could benefit from ad revenue moving off FB.
160 2018-07-25 22:45:39 Can you clarify your point? Market cap based index funds don’t sell stocks when they fall in price. The price decline adjusts the weight for them.
161 2018-07-25 22:45:37 Why is finding stocks for manipulation so hardddddddddd >:(
162 2018-07-25 22:44:51 Also FYI you short/long stocks. You buy and sell calls and puts for commodities comrade
163 2018-07-25 22:44:42 This white house will be dragged through the streets in shame and put into the public stocks for the entire country to ridicule, throw rotten produce at and otherwise abuse them before they are off to jail.  They think we're a lot stupider than we are.
164 2018-07-25 22:44:28 I own stocks, which means I am in the minority. The stock market has been climbing since 2009. But I have a hard time getting past the serial lying, narcissistic, autocratic-leaning, Russia agenda pushing, cheat-to-win, adulterous issues before I get to his other "qualities".
165 2018-07-25 22:44:06 How is ford stocks going? Going bankrupt in two years. Tesla will eat your lunch.
166 2018-07-25 22:43:48 I don't really care about stocks and I try not to talk about them, but I just saw that $FB (Facebook) fell 20% in after-hours trading. I bet it has a pretty good dead-cat bounce this week. Could be the canary for FANG.
167 2018-07-25 22:43:44 @permabear_uk At least we know 1 company that's out of the race to 1T... #FB down 24% after hours :)
168 2018-07-25 22:43:44 From what I understand, the U.S. has large amounts of LNG. Think I'll go over LNG stocks
tonight. Maybe tanker stocks that ship LNG too.
169 2018-07-25 22:43:43 @realDonaldTrump is still coasting on foundations of the economy that @BarackObama built; all he did was add some nitro and take off the breaks...

And you represent investors; why is the market down since his tax cuts? And who's buying stocks aside from #buybacks?
170 2018-07-25 22:43:35 But ppl have been saying that about stocks for so many years now. Also important to note that the post-mkt dip bounced off the trendline
171 2018-07-25 22:43:05 $SQQQ Gonna be a nice tomorrow with $FB in the dumpster. #earnings #Facebook #stocks #daytrader #profit
172 2018-07-25 22:43:02 Yes heard this in the car on when I left work!! Stocks up!!!!
173 2018-07-25 22:42:08 Or made stocks?
174 2018-07-25 22:42:06 So are we just going to ANG stocks?
175 2018-07-25 22:41:41 YEAH main abilities for clothes are different on splatnet but the thing is that you gotta be constantly checking it so itll probably be a while until you find the gear with the ability you want on it but it stocks new items every 2 hours
176 2018-07-25 22:41:27 I think we can at least agree that if Jesus were alive today he'd say that that adultery commandment is overrated and that bump stocks are protected by the Second Amendment.
177 2018-07-25 22:41:25 My stocks up 3 points, it’s a good day
178 2018-07-25 22:40:47 $FB Down 41 pts! Geez! #earnings #facebook #stocks

180 2018-07-25 22:40:09 U.S. Stocks surges more than 150 points after Trump reportedly gets concessions from EU to avoid a trade war

The major indexes surged in the last hour of trading after Dow Jones reported that the EU has agreed to import more U.S. soybeans.
181 2018-07-25 22:39:35 Tech stocks are the devil!

190 2018-07-25 22:35:43 As long as we have adequate food stocks Brexit won't be that bad I suppose. Mustn't grumble.

Uranium stocks will do that so easy  quickly
192 2018-07-25 22:34:44 What do ya bet that after he badmouthed Amazon and others causing their stocks to tumble, he and his corrupt cronies bought up a bunch of the stock on the (relatively) cheap. #ConflictOfInterest
193 2018-07-25 22:34:24 At some point, it’s ‘not’ a good buying opportunity.  Is it this time?  Maybe, maybe not?  When stocks the size of FB drop 20%+ its time to step back and say do I know what ‘real’ risk is?  Vegas didn’t build all those hotels because the house lost.
194 2018-07-25 22:33:51 With #FB stock falling 20% after hours today, I’m sure hoping I do not own any within my 401K and other investments. This is why owning single stocks is risky and why I’ll only invest in mutual funds etc.
195 2018-07-25 22:33:50 Uptick largely benefits wealthy; why then is it praised?

Stocks market recovered value within 1.5-2 year after recession, adjusted for inflation. This uptick is NOT responsible for that. It only helps the rich which the Trump is fighting for.

Not to mention influence of HFT.
196 2018-07-25 22:33:19 $SPY It's a big gamble holding many stocks through earnings. So much easier (with less risk) to take advantage after. A good example is $WIX
197 2018-07-25 22:33:07 With stocks tanking  it looks like  the Bitcoin bankroll is fixing to get a lot Bigger.
198 2018-07-25 22:32:36 Commodities: US stocks, flat... For AT&T: they beat expectations in earnings, missed quarterly revenues with 1st report at 9 cents a share, 85 cents...Revenue: slightly short at $38.99... projected:$39.39... full year adjustments...

203 2018-07-25 22:31:24 Hopefully the tank in $FB will spread across more stocks in the tech sector... been getting bored with low vol this past month !
204 2018-07-25 22:31:14 Is this the moment we look back on few years down the road and wonder why the eff we did not short the snot out of the $FANG Stocks + $Tsla of course???? $fb $amzn $googl $nflx
205 2018-07-25 22:31:13 Man it’s going to be weird if this is how stocks finally roll over.
206 2018-07-25 22:31:09 It appears in the aftermarket that a new acronym has been created courtesy of $FB earnings: #FOF "Fear of #FANG" as there were substantial selloffs in those stocks simply because of guilt by association and valuation. $SPX $NDX $IWM
207 2018-07-25 22:30:36 Buy value stocks and sell growth, that's the play from here on out for the next few months 

#timestamp #savethistweet
208 2018-07-25 22:30:00 Don’t worry suckerburg will announce buy back FB stocks using the tax cuts from trump and FB will go up 50 points by close tommorow
209 2018-07-25 22:29:46 Between this and his support of James Gunn, I’d say his career is plummeting faster than FB stocks right now.
210 2018-07-25 22:29:46 Keep in mind.....the expense ratio is not the only revenue source. Lending out the underlying stocks being held also drives revenue. Nonetheless, overall revenue compression still occuring.
211 2018-07-25 22:29:24 I’m thinking bout buying stocks 
212 2018-07-25 22:29:19 By that logic stocks are an MLM scheme on top of USD. It's a pointless analogy you're trying to perpetuate for its negative connotation.

214 2018-07-25 22:29:03 What's going on with Facebook stocks?
215 2018-07-25 22:29:03 1) Your stocks went up WAY more between 2009-2017 than since 2017.

2) Lower taxes, I agree. My paycheck is bigger too. Those budget deficits tho.

3) Your perception of safety is subjective. If you live in the US, crime has been dropping for decades.
216 2018-07-25 22:27:52 Now I know what everyone keeps saying delete your facebook account. Stocks sold but market doesn't change. Thanks!

219 2018-07-25 22:26:04 Who's selling Facebook stocks.
220 2018-07-25 22:26:00 21 breakouts cont: $THC, $USNA (gap), $VICR (gap), $WSC, $YEXT. Good mix of stocks with few low priced guff - bullish.

224 2018-07-25 22:24:50 If anyone's looking for a second phase ball, remember that big falls in widely held stocks tend to lead to credit losses for retail brokerages who have done silly things with margin accounts.
225 2018-07-25 22:23:36 Nothing grand about showing how 1-5% of Holder’s of a specific asset are going to be millionaires. Same % is probably true with real estate, stocks etc.
226 2018-07-25 22:23:16 Fully liquid companies becoming self sufficient with AI, imagine it taking zero energy to run the Fang stocks?
227 2018-07-25 22:22:50 We haven’t managed on self sufficient food stocks for over 100 years. Still, there’ll be sovereignty to feast on.
228 2018-07-25 22:22:02 And here I thought you were going to talk about people who sell a stocks they don’t own, expecting the price of said stock to decline so they can buy the shares they had previously sold
229 2018-07-25 22:21:49 And everyone: $TSLA isn't even a viable company. SORRY. Its a freaking SAD car company. I wouldn't even buy it $150. That's right, Musk' s shenanigans certainly aren't helping. But you all gotta get real with some of these overblown stocks.

I don't know how the concept of "Sajaegi" intertwines nor does it make any sense. When they've never had a decrease in stocks while having sold out on all of them.
233 2018-07-25 22:20:40 #FollowTheMoney Who is buying and selling these stocks and futures? Trump creates crisis, stock price drops, it’s bought by Trump Org and cronies (?), Trump announces vague trade deal, stock price soars, stock is sold for profit. #MarketManipulation

236 2018-07-25 22:20:18 RCA in 1929, Polaroid in 1972, Nortel, Nokia etc in 2000. Stocks in manias typically have little predictive value for the subsequent decade+
237 2018-07-25 22:20:08 So, just the other day he said "Tariffs are great."  We are in the midst of a tariff war with China that has caused Trump to resort to "socialist" bail-out policies for US farmers. We're far from deal w/ EU (See NAFTA).  GM, Whirlpool, Harley stocks getting creamed. #Mercantilism
238 2018-07-25 22:20:08 Yeah what Tim said and this has nothing to do with what I was arguing in my thread, which I think most gun owners would agree with. BUT! Is the answer they’re both Ruger Mini-14s in different stocks and this is a trick question to own people?!
239 2018-07-25 22:19:23 Remarkably, stocks I watch, AAPL, AMZN, GOOG are also way down (in sympathy??) starting at about 5:20 ET after hours. Not as extreme as FB but it's an interesting "coincidence"
240 2018-07-25 22:18:46 So what? I've beat the crap out of $BRK over the last 10 years while avoiding sin stocks. lol

244 2018-07-25 22:17:26 @CNBCFastMoney @MelissaLeeCNBC @GuyAdami @petenajarian @timseymour @RiskReversal With the Facebook fiasco there was no final trade, which given the way the market will likely trade tomorrow probably should be the "final short". OK, what stocks would each of you short on Thursday?
245 2018-07-25 22:17:21 Can I be happy about my stocks kicking ass or does that make me a piece of shit?

255 2018-07-25 22:13:18 Time to boycott all their sponsors.  Stocks go down.  Block their sponsors ads.
256 2018-07-25 22:13:00 @DougKass  If AMZN is bad it could trigger an extinction event for the ETF market which will crash the entire market.   So many 50%  overvalued growth stocks depend on ETF buying of growth names.  In a liquidation event i think many names will have margin calls at prices 40% down

262 2018-07-25 22:11:56 Last I checked, the world doesn’t end tomorrow. Stocks go up and stocks go down. LONG TERM OVER THE NEXT DECADE, FACEBOOK WILL SUCCEED.
263 2018-07-25 22:11:45 Maybe for a quick bounce but my bet is money starts rolling into value stocks
264 2018-07-25 22:11:35 I’m feeling petty tonight. Trump’s Hollywood star got smashed, and Facebook stocks plunged 20 percent. And I’m smirking. Bigly. There’s much bigger stuff to care about, but one moment of annoyance for them makes me a tad vindictive.
265 2018-07-25 22:11:34 Now with two FAANG stocks broken, $NDX no longer super bullish for me
266 2018-07-25 22:11:08 #Facebook is dropping -20% and counting. Where are all the FUD articles from MSM saying it's a speculative bubble? Unlike #Bitcoin, stock markets are not 24/7. No way to dump your stocks now! What a scam!
267 2018-07-25 22:10:49 Anyone on here nasty in #Stocks ?
268 2018-07-25 22:10:38 We use to say a stocks value could turn on a dime. Now, it can turn on a pin point. 

It wouldn't surprise me if $FB has a good quarter & flashes up.
269 2018-07-25 22:10:33 Got long time ago was $50. But couldn't win a Ferrari. I can win the stocks only. Ha ha take forever.

279 2018-07-25 22:07:10 Agreed. The CPCE keeps me in check. Only using 10% of my capital in my trading account. Also long term IRA does not have the FANG stocks anymore

CNBC's Jim Cramer members of FANG, the "Mad Money" host's acronym for the stocks of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google, now Alphabet.
287 2018-07-25 22:05:25 I predicted this dump, as it is happening to all major tech corporations.
All of them are hitting ceilings and can't meet the unrealistic expectations of the bull market investors.
But I don't trade stocks.. 
Congratulations on your win.

290 2018-07-25 22:04:08 Hey Boris ( scarfman) your company stocks are taking a massive dump and your silence on Yunify and how it even became as well as the phoney looking videos and the pics in the empty field have yet to be explained to shareholders
291 2018-07-25 22:04:03 investing in stocks is like playing a risky game but i love it
292 2018-07-25 22:03:57 buy FANG- Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google
FANG does not have a stake in china  so immune to trade war. But Facebook and Netflix stocks get punished more than 19% after earning in after market trading. Google went up more than $50. Only Amazon earnings are in wait @jimcramer
293 2018-07-25 22:03:55 Facebook sinks after a low earnings report. Can’t blame a trade war on that. Look for Instagram to skyrocket especially with the addition of @instagram TV. We are in a video first world! #facebook #instagram #Entrepreneur #IGTV #marketing #ads #earnings #socialmedia #stocks
294 2018-07-25 22:03:43 This administration is out of control. Acting like the 3rd Reich. gop Congress inert so I am afraid our only choice is to tank the economy - sell stocks and do not make any major purchases
295 2018-07-25 22:02:27 The ordinary Americans who keep their savings in the form of stocks in those companies are definitely very happy that Donald Trump is doing his job so well - you only need to look at his approval rating
296 2018-07-25 22:01:56 And these stocks are what was holding the market up imo.....
297 2018-07-25 22:01:54 Totally agree. I’m in the same boat and need pain meds on hand for when I need them. I am treated like a criminal every time I get a scrip filled. Chronic pain patients need access to these meds and it’s getting increasingly difficult to even find a pharmacy that stocks them.
298 2018-07-25 22:01:38 How is it inexplicable?  The NRA snaps it's fingers the GOP dances in whatever direction demanded, just like what has happened with bump stocks and will happen soon with suppressors and silencers and who knows what other idiocy.
299 2018-07-25 22:01:12 @groditi Hey! If it isn't too much to ask, could you recommend a few books that would serve as great introudctions to financial markets?

301 2018-07-25 22:00:35 Facebook down around -24% after hours, tanking ALL Nasdaq tech stocks.  wow.  Sounds like a buying opportunity for a quick trade for the bounce tomorrow.  Earnings miss wasn't that bad.

305 2018-07-25 21:58:38 Well, of course you made money on crypto.  You were in 3 years ago.  There are plenty of stocks that have gotten people rich, but no longer have the same room for growth.  You were lucky.

313 2018-07-25 21:56:34 Really? He also said he was going to raise the age of purchasing guns and stop the selling of bump stocks. Didn’t happen. He lied. Again.

338 2018-07-25 21:47:41 I sold most my shares last year before the privacy scandal. Still hold some that I bought after IPO. I thought it has been over-valued. Most of the other tech stocks aren't doing any better despite beating earnings. It may recover quickly though.
339 2018-07-25 21:46:41 My sincere condolences to $FB $PYPL earnings traders. There were over 55 BUY ratings on these stocks going into today. Going ALL IN on $FB has been a consistently profitable strategy for many years and many people do go ALL IN.. damn.. $QQQ $SPY $SPX

389 2018-07-25 21:21:53 That's a nice long list, though job growth, job creation, and low unemployment are all the same thing, and all are characterized by lower wages. Tax cuts went to corporate leaders who then reinvested in stocks, not employees.
390 2018-07-25 21:21:28 If you have a string of losses, paper trading can help you get your groove back. I also found it’s helpful to watch Stocks you’re not in and analyze price action. It helps take the emotion out of the equation.

400 2018-07-25 21:16:31 @greggutfeld hey Greg ask Juan Williams how many millions of dollars he's made off of Donald Trump and the stocks he only bites the hand that feeds him
401 2018-07-25 21:16:21 Yes, but remember. They're reinvesting all of the time. Look at drops as buying opportunities, just like stocks. That's why I'm so adamant about rebalancing investments. That discipline keeps the allocation intact and systematically you're buying low and selling high.
402 2018-07-25 21:16:12 How much of their military and defense is the US bankrolling? Also, what happens to that socialist Utopia when their oil runs out? Their welfare state is funded by high taxes and oil profits. Nobody here is going to pay higher taxes so someone can get a handout.
403 2018-07-25 21:15:15 Today, GM stocks dropped drastically with news of trade. He is destroying America. Glad he’s not giving Obama credit for the economy he inherited bc in the end we will need several bailouts!

406 2018-07-25 21:13:18 Yes amazing how US stocks / indices continue their rampant march upwards compared to pretty much flat YTD for UK indices 
407 2018-07-25 21:13:06 And every employee at Amazon is PAYING their taxes out of those purposeful light pay checks. All for the stock holder, stocks that they will never own.

409 2018-07-25 21:11:42 US automakers just reduced projected earnings. Their stocks took hits. Increased cost of production from steel and other items impacted by tariffs.

This, along with farmers $, are the beginning signs of his economic policies in action.

413 2018-07-25 21:09:01 I don’t know the answer. Maybe style investing itself makes no sense and we should just all strive to own stocks priced cheap to their fundamentals, whether high or low growth.

420 2018-07-25 21:06:17 Why yes, yes it does. But that opens the argument to looking for a different definition of "growth" as stocks with high price-to-book ratios, no?
421 2018-07-25 21:06:13 $RETA is probably manipulated because they want to do an offering at market conditions. So they seem to keep it up until then. This is not how most high-priced stocks behave. Most of them are not that choppy. But I feel your frustration.

525 2018-07-25 20:24:26 If $FB accounts for 1/5 of #StockMarket & it drops 10%, the Nasdaq should be down 2% tomorrow. #stocks #CNBC #WallStreet #BigFatUglyBubble
526 2018-07-25 20:24:09 Also, sending stocks soaring? 172 points is less than 1%
527 2018-07-25 20:22:31 $FB & $AMD are 2 stocks I'm interested in to trade now since earnings are over. $SPOT & $MCD as well since they report before tomorrow's open.
So, let's see tomorrow if I can find anything interesting in those stocks tomorrow.

659 2018-07-25 19:36:52 My hair is almost 7 inches, my afro stocks out 1.5-2 depending on the place
660 2018-07-25 19:35:47 Do you know the Relative Strength Index?
RSI measures the momentum of price action. A stock with an RSI >70 may be overbought, <30 it may be oversold & due for an "oversold bounce."
A random batch of stocks with an RSI ~30:
$AVP
$DISH
$STON
$GIL
$GNC

667 2018-07-25 19:32:31 All being well, we’ll be selling these pretty funky, limited edition, Norfolk t-shirts at the beer festival this weekend.   Get yours for the bargain price of just £10 whilst stocks last. 

Many thanks to Gary Pooley of Steele Media for designing & supplying them
668 2018-07-25 19:32:05 Bro I’m sorry but your a lost cause. Stick to screwing over newbies in penny stocks 
And enjoy all the gains in your portfolio as Trump keeps building American infrastructure 

669 2018-07-25 19:32:03 Bonni blocked me a long time ago when I pointed out that attending a Tesla party on a private jet (which she tweeted about) somehow doesn’t match her profile claim: “Oil is for sissies.” Same for other Tesla bulls investing in oil stocks ( hello @GerberKawasaki ). Dual standards.

686 2018-07-25 19:20:22 My grandpa was a doctor in a small town his whole life. When he retired, he started investing in stocks. He made more in 10 years of sitting at his computer than he did in his entire doctor career. Why was he more entitled to that money than the employees of the companies? (1/3)
687 2018-07-25 19:20:17 People make money on penny stocks (or so I heard in the 70's).
688 2018-07-25 19:20:06 Grayson, Brynleigh, & unborn () will always be straight... National guard & College, going to flip some houses, invest in some good stocks .. and take care of my nieces and nephews. That’s a fact.
689 2018-07-25 19:19:47 I like the digit app! It's like a zero effort investment thing, so not full on stocks like what you might be looking for. I don't fully understand it but it's an easy way for me to set aside savings.

696 2018-07-25 19:16:16 Maybe some 'normal' stocks? Return is way less than crypto but IMO safer...

706 2018-07-25 19:11:03 This is a perfect example of why trickle down economics doesn’t work. Corporations who were already posting phenomenal profits quarterly, didn’t expand and create more jobs, they just bought back their stocks so their shareholders and executives get richer! Trump duped you-TRUTH!
707 2018-07-25 19:10:27 So you admit that you have been contacting other traders and bashing stocks.
708 2018-07-25 19:09:58 Im done scalping with penny stocks.  Going macro.
709 2018-07-25 19:09:43 Some nice reversals in #stocks I follow. But a lot of volatility and earnings ahead. Besides that I don't see any volume.

711 2018-07-25 19:08:38 You're delusional. The debt is going through the roof, the deficit has doubled this year and due to triple next year, tariffs r bringing US businesses to their knees, tax cuts went to the wealthy and corporate buybacks, stocks aren't benefitting the middle class & wages are down!
712 2018-07-25 19:08:11  you don’t know what I think. Tar and feathers come to mind. Put him in stocks in Lafayette Square.

719 2018-07-25 19:04:01 like 4 years ago when I was making a tiny marginal amount of money I could save I made the poor (but not that big because it wasn’t much money) I made the mistake of investing in a couple of stocks

Not mistake because I lost money - it was a wash - but bc I get investor emails
720 2018-07-25 19:03:27 maybe 10 more stocks?
721 2018-07-25 19:02:33 Sometimes they halt stocks for news pending after hours is what I meant

727 2018-07-25 19:00:05 1 in 3 millennials say cash is a good place to hold money for long term. I understand we are fresh off the last recession but cash returns less than 1% interest which means you're losing money over time. Poor way to build your wealth at your young age. Stocks + real estate FTW.

757 2018-07-25 18:48:04 The rich stay rich by using other people's money for as long as they possibly can. Debt is always high and cash on hand is always low. It all gets paid for when the life insurance money comes in and the stocks gets cashed in when they kick the bucket.

977 2018-07-25 17:01:15 Owning “value stocks” like Tata motors,Icici bank, ITC I guess gives some intellectual satisfaction but are we investing in stocks to make money or prove how smart “value “ investors one is?

985 2018-07-25 16:56:54 Well the current regulations are obviously not enough, since the shootings are still happening. Banning anything that people wouldn't logically have any reason to own would be a good place to start (AR-15, bump stocks, armor piercing bullets, etc.).

991 2018-07-25 16:55:07 Strong uptrends - stocks that continuously float higher, with the occasional "get me the F out" selloff.

Strong downtrends - stocks that continuously bleed lower, with the occasional "rip your face off" short squeeze.
992 2018-07-25 16:54:55 Not only that some of the worst stocks which many had shorted as a hedge shot up in value because of the sudden surge in demand to cover these shorts. So the best stocks went down and the worst up hitting the large institutions both ways.
993 2018-07-25 16:54:33 Retail stocks were due a break and that is what we are seeing on some like $FIVE $BURL $LULU and others
994 2018-07-25 16:54:17 Quit crypto. Most people can’t deal with the volatility, so it’s perfectly understandable if you can’t either. If you can’t handle 7 days, this asset class isn’t for you. Invest in stocks.

1001 2018-07-25 16:51:59 Maybe you can also explain why consumer price increases are the fastest in 6 years, why they are paying $.75/gallon more at the pump since the election, and why wages are flat as companies buy back their own stocks instead of re-investing in workers.
1002 2018-07-25 16:51:04 This I think I know - rates are going to rise. This will impact everything else. Inv are very slow to grasp or believe it. Most inv today came in after 2016.

1053 2018-07-25 16:29:02 The thing about stocks like $GM & $F is that they fool you with their seemingly value-like qualities, such as low P/E & high dividend yields.

In reality, they look cheapest when they are in fact at their most expensive.

1061 2018-07-25 16:26:38 I believe in the working class, as I was one of them. However, companies have the right to buy & sell stocks of their company at any time. Selling is borrowing money, buying is paying off debt & they can go private.

3. no, they're not being greedy by not giving you their money

After retirement, 4% withdrawals are suggested.

1364 2018-07-25 14:32:16 Warnings of a new tech bubble paint the market with too broad of a brush. Instead of selling & waiting for the crash, investors should focus on performing fundamental diligence & separating the story stocks from the companies w/cash flows to support their stock prices.

1484 2018-07-25 13:49:58 Investor vs Speculator. Who are you?

Investors: buy companies, understand the core business and treat the stock as his own business.

Speculator: buys stocks depending on price fluctuations and by predicting what the herd might do, effectively becoming part of the herd

1709 2018-07-25 11:32:59 Excess volatility (Shiller) is present in prices of stocks, bonds, real estate. Your approach puts that at the centre and makes it risk. In the long run it disappears because asset prices are excessively volatile compared to expected discounted earnings.

1719 2018-07-25 11:26:53 “What we observed was that while Nifty and Sensex have done much better than the small and midcap indices, even within the Nifty, the performance is really concentrated in top 10 stocks. These stocks have contributed to 218% of Nifty’s gains.” @neelkanthmishra #nifty
1720 2018-07-25 11:26:10 Finally, even Ross Gerber or whatever his name is, a $TSLA long, holds lot of energy stocks. It's so deeply retarded to think that having energy stocks or energy business motivates anyone to be short TSLA.

1728 2018-07-25 11:22:56 How indexes define value is indeed kind of stupid. Buffett however made money with different strategies. He started as an old school value guy, switched to growing consumer stocks and currently is buying mostly entire businesses with reinvestment opportunities.

1823 2018-07-25 10:08:21 Potentially .. Software stocks.. with CRM and MSFT as the big cap liquids and leaders like NTNX, TWLO and COUP as well as Cyber Security stocks with PANW being the big cap liquid and OKTA and SAIL
1824 2018-07-25 10:08:13 He scored a screamer against us at your gaff if I remember correctly?  15 assists  good engine on him?
1825 2018-07-25 10:07:26 He's certainly a serial entreprenuer. It's a hard call as a lot of companies fail for many reasons. Without exception, all successful business people have had failures. In fact mangement of some of my best performing stocks have lead failures.

1828 2018-07-25 10:06:52 Excellent player mate, gutted to see him go. He’s a set piece specialist and he chipped in with 15 assists from LWB last season.
1829 2018-07-25 10:06:04 You let your apoplectic feelings about the man, his mannerisms and his antics prevent you from seeing the good. E.g. lower taxes has improved corporate earnings and stocks and benefiting anyone who has a 401k retirement
1830 2018-07-25 10:05:01 “Ownership in a stock means that you own a slice of an actual business. This is important when viewing insider ‘clustered’ buying or selling. Such events can often be a precursor to moves in the share price, and are worth watching for closely.” #stocks @LVDTA

1832 2018-07-25 10:01:21 I concur Just looking at the facts:
Stocks failed to surpass their January highs. 
We have sky-high valuations for securities

Rising interest rates [Started Dec 2015], recession usually follows in 34 months from start of rate rise cycle. This October!
1833 2018-07-25 10:01:08 He called my boss because I was constantly attacking him personally and spreading fake news just to devaluate their stocks. That is just unfair, I have a right to ruin or bully somebody, haven't I?

1954 2018-07-25 07:52:40 Our supply chains assume rapid, smooth flow of goods. Minimum stocks are held. They cross many borders—maybe more than once—which is ok if borders are “frictionless”.

2) For stocks advancing above 70 degree, sell into strength at 1st sign of weakness

Either way, I like my odds much better.

2196 2018-07-25 04:31:36 The stock market isn't quite the same as a lottery ticket. The lottery is entirely random. Stocks rise and fall as the companies do better or worse is the public eye. You can tell when stocks will rise or fall if you track the company close enough.
2197 2018-07-25 04:31:27 @ahmedpatel ..Ahmedbhai...98percent stock prices have collapsed by half...but by manipulating nifty 3 stocks, nifty is making new high. This misguides investors and middle class. Big scam. Raise this one. Can share detail with Kamat Saheb

2202 2018-07-25 04:28:29 I have two working non-cannabis swing trades ( $BB and $KOSS ) a couple swings on cannabis stocks, and the rest of my 'big' positions are basically holding till the fall as position-trades. Think this gets worse before getting better. Still some cash if I get really sporty.

2214 2018-07-25 04:20:46 The top 10 S&P 500 stocks have contributed more than 100% of the index’s year-to-date gain. Meanwhile, the top 5 stocks have contributed over 90% of the S&P 500’s year-to-date gain. Can you guess these names?

If it was all about QE, should Japanese stocks not be outperforming the US?

2289 2018-07-25 03:09:40 Guilty of trying to reason the markets, eg, don't buy #gold #stocks if the gold price is weak, and don't buy retail stocks because consumers are mortgaged or rent-stressed. Over that now, so I just review favoured chart technicals,  $NBL.AX $AQG.AX $GMD.AX recent buys #XAO
2290 2018-07-25 03:09:26 European stocks rose on Tuesday, enjoying their best daily climb since late June amid well received results and improved manufacturing data. Peugeot soared 15% and Dutch recruiter Randstad climbed 3.9% as they reported strong earnings results.
2291 2018-07-25 03:09:10 Energy stocks made strong gains as Chevron climbed 2.1%, Exxon Mobil rose 2.0%, and ConocoPhillips and Occidental gained 1.2%.
2292 2018-07-25 03:09:00 I think some of the recent IPO movers could offer good opportunities as they form bases during market correction. Lots of them moved up pretty fast and then reversed. e.g. HUYA, IQ, SFIX  not necessarily SQ quality stocks though. GOOGL also looks interesting after the GAP.
2293 2018-07-25 03:08:22 US stocks mostly rose on Tuesday, powered by a number of positive earnings results.

2295 2018-07-25 03:06:10 Maybe the momentum trapezes between both ends of the broad  spectrum of stocks.  Perhaps its undoing the excessive swing twoards the so called hope stocks and the focus is back at the growth stocks once again. Meanwhile the rationality remains scarce.

2412 2018-07-25 01:55:35 It is a mistake for investors with long-term horizons –among them, pension funds, college endowments and savings-minded individuals –to measure their investment “risk” by their portfolio’s ratio of bonds to stocks. Often, high-grade bonds in an investment port. increase its risk.

2417 2018-07-25 01:50:29 Different businesses altogether.
Businesses in different sectors are usually not compared for valuations.

2423 2018-07-25 01:48:23 Hi Derek, a couple things to clarify. 

Bonds pay interest, not dividends, an important distinction for tax purposes (favouring income stocks in that regard). 

The decreasing value on rising interest rates reflects opportunity cost. The bond still pays the face value at maturity

2432 2018-07-25 01:42:16 Many novice real estate investors soon quit the profession and invest in a well-diversified portfolio of bonds. That's because, when you invest in real estate, you often see a side of humanity that stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and saving money shelter you from.
2433 2018-07-25 01:41:48 Massive wall street campaign over the last eleven months to trash the markets despite great earnings and forecasts for majority of U.S companies. Financials completely ignored, only a few darling insider stocks get spared while most others get slammed. Complete SCAM, remember '08

2435 2018-07-25 01:41:02 No context. Too lazy to get it. My criminal justice views are public hangings. Stocks in the public square and dipping in honey and being fed to rabid badgers.

2440 2018-07-25 01:38:05 Market can give irrationally high PE multiple to stocks that are expected to give sustainable good growth in Volume and profits.

2474 2018-07-25 01:11:42 Real Estate is much like stocks, it can and will go up and down. The economy is good right now.... but I can assure you it will be a wreck within the next 10 years. Which will certainly cause many ppl to be underwater(owing more than the property is worth) in their mortgage
2475 2018-07-25 01:07:12 Obama=Stocks rose from under 7,000 to almost 20,000. Unemployment from over 10% to almost 4%. Ended worst recession in decades. Created more jobs than Trump in same time period. Trump inherited a strong economy.

2485 2018-07-25 00:57:45 Ross has monetized his position -remember the stocks he sold?
2486 2018-07-25 00:57:43 Would suggest those stocks are going... higher?
2487 2018-07-25 00:56:48 They will make more money. Also the government will supplement any farmer that has a loss if any do. Majority will make more money.

2489 2018-07-25 00:55:40 Thanks to Trump and making sure the 1% got there's its gonna get worse. He thinks $30,000 wage lets you buy stocks and raise your family. Then most companies has no or poor benefits( no healthcare).
2490 2018-07-25 00:55:03 I will politely disagree. It doesn’t matter how much money someone makes, they don’t deserve to be verbally assaulted. I don’t see anyone tweeting @ CEO’s of companies bc the stocks are doing poorly. That’s just an excuse!
2491 2018-07-25 00:54:40 FACT: Worker pay in the second quarter dropped nearly one percent below its first-quarter level.

FACT: Wages fell 1.4 percent from 2017, effecting 80% of industries & 2/3 of metro areas affected.

FACT: Worker wages drop while companies spend $700 billion to boost stocks
2492 2018-07-25 00:54:07 @realDonaldTrump  Where is this $12 Billion dollars in farmer aid coming from? Medicare? Disability? The VA? Definitely not from top 1% who got TRILLIONS in tax cuts, then raised their dividends, bought back their stocks, & enriched themselves more.  With American taxpayer money!

2494 2018-07-25 00:53:47 Yeah, when that was written they had muskets. AR-15's were not a problem along with bump stocks. I'm not so sure this is a good thing.
2495 2018-07-25 00:51:55 Steven, where is this $12 Billion dollars coming from?  Medicare?  Disability?  The VA?

2498 2018-07-25 00:49:00 Btc is still quite small in the grand scheme of things.....you can't "fix" volatility....same as small cap stocks....i think we just disagree on the argument that you can take bitcoin's price over the years and average it- the asset and marketplace have evolved too much for that

2504 2018-07-25 00:46:27 I bet 100 dollars every single member who voted against eliminating ShotSpotter funding, has SSTI in their stock portfolio.  There's a reason those stocks grow so high with federal and provincial funding.  Gross.

2521 2018-07-25 00:32:49 High for 2014 on the board was in May, as expected at around $15... low for the year around harvest was around $9. 2017 never dropped below $9 on the board last year. The downward pressure now is a tariffs, prior price pressure due to ample supplies and ending stocks (2/2)

2537 2018-07-25 00:18:06 I think it applies to all *non-productive* stores of value. But yes, some of the value stored in BTC should be shifted to stocks when appropriate. There's probably a healthy ratio of non-productive vs. productive depending on the circumstances.
