64 2018-08-09 23:26:27 VERY GOOD anology LooL that’s why I grinch when I hear the word “investing” used to describe trading  stocks or options
65 2018-08-09 23:26:22 There should be a law that if you serve in Congress you can’t buy and sell stocks. Then only people who wanted to serve rather than enrich themselves at taxpayer expense would serve.

73 2018-08-09 23:22:42 No, I don't trade stocks and I wouldn't tweet on them if I did without disclosing ---- as you've been doing until I asked you. I think that's pretty crappy behavior. Why do you act like that?
74 2018-08-09 23:22:28 Too many ifs por them to be "viable". If you could charge one per stock it'd be pace-breaking to the point of boredom. Once per 3 stocks AND considerably weakened AND sorta balanced...maybe.
75 2018-08-09 23:21:43 Instead of reading to kids, Be a senator and debate you Opponent, Richard Painter? Sell your medical device stocks so your not rolling in the swamp? If you win the primary, Housley would use this as a battering ram against you. Painter is the candidate to best handle Housley!

77 2018-08-09 23:20:52 Her talk about #indyref2 was adrenaline fuelled and a political hammer blow, although she later had the insight to apportion this to bad timing. If/when enough blood is lost from #Brexit self-harm later on, that graph will rise like Bitcoin stocks.
78 2018-08-09 23:20:42 Your big short idea was announced on June 29 at 2.19 and has been higher than that a couple of days. Pot stocks falling in the summer time? It must be your shorting lol.

92 2018-08-09 23:11:15 That seems great. Ultimate should have more crew battles due to the new crew mode. FS with stage morphs and possibly rage(if there's a toggle), and stamina battles (since they now have stocks in stamina) would be such a thrill to see. This game has hella side event potential.

111 2018-08-09 22:57:50 While #Demecrats push for higher #tax rates to grow #government programs.  The result companies are using the tax breaks to buy back stocks instead of #wage increases, government spending is sky rocketing. all while taxes continue to wax and wane.
112 2018-08-09 22:57:45 True, but I doubt it’s as bad with stocks, and their returns have been far higher than gold in all but a few periods
113 2018-08-09 22:56:49 You have chosen not to sell your medical device stocks before the primary? Why do you continue to stay in the swamp? You simply can’t force yourself to climb out. Oh,I get that you personally will make millions on it but you are running for senate. It’s corrupt.
114 2018-08-09 22:56:35 After going through about 5000 charts, I think it's very clear that there are much better opportunities long in individual stocks than there are in Sector ETFs or Index funds. That's how I see things right now
115 2018-08-09 22:56:14 Not saying it was. That said, this was published  at the end of December 2008 and Mid Jan 2009. 

That 7 for 1 split was not certain at the time and the entire global financial system was on fire. 

It wasn't super easy to say "buy stocks" to your friends and family at the time.

125 2018-08-09 22:49:14 Am I the only one that wonders why the F word is necessary when tweeting about stocks or trades? All are free to write this way but if they understood why people use profanity in the first place they probably would avoid.
126 2018-08-09 22:49:07 If I shorted stocks when I first started trading I would have been hugely successful. Maybe an idea for all newbies 
127 2018-08-09 22:48:44 The only case for gold (IMO) is from a rebalancing bonus: with a small part of a portfolio otherwise invested in stocks/bonds and rebalanced. The problem is very few can keep buying more thru two+ decades of negative returns!
128 2018-08-09 22:47:35 Unless all these men have stocks and bonds and hidden money in the Cayman Islands. Or like illegal businesses.
129 2018-08-09 22:47:27 You need to tend to all those ETFs. The ones brimming with oil & gas stocks. That's some might impressive active management you got going there, chief.
130 2018-08-09 22:45:44 Out of interest - what’s vol, max drawdown and return of stocks and gold since 2000, and most importantly, of a 50:50 stock gold portfolio ?
131 2018-08-09 22:45:07 That’s true, but in the case of stocks, their recovery since 2008 (even after QE ended, rates rose, etc.) has been no different than bear market recoveries post 1932, 1937, 1974, and 2002; circumstances diff but stocks responded the same as economy fully recovered in every case
132 2018-08-09 22:45:06 They transfer around stocks but the bigger problem i think its how fast they build up...from the look of it on the clip 100% of dmg taken = 1 bar and thats without counting the dmg you do which also fills up the bar and then they also fill up over time as well
133 2018-08-09 22:44:26 Any good stocks you recommend?
134 2018-08-09 22:43:50 I can see that and some of that has also likely increased because of things Trump has done to affect certain stocks and even the market now. I don't think it is all because of Trump, but I think a lot of it is. Some also might be due to their mobile apps also.
135 2018-08-09 22:43:23 ha, it does. it does ! @aifreckle: Love that I got an email from Beatyard last week mentioning that stocks of Hollows and Fentimans ginger beer had run out entirely in Ireland (except for their own stash). The sun has us RUINED.
136 2018-08-09 22:43:05 If people actually use final smash meter then the game is at least 4 stocks
137 2018-08-09 22:42:59 Setting up a 401k and investing in stocks at this age is such a grest decision. If you can, you should too!
138 2018-08-09 22:42:38 Gold has been as/more volatile than stocks — volatility of 17.9 vs 13.6 for S&P 500 since 2004
139 2018-08-09 22:42:11 @SenBobCasey, please divest of your pharma stocks and any other things that give the appearance of an ethics issues, and urge your colleagues to do the same.
140 2018-08-09 22:41:56 Your right valuations don't matter anymore right. I'm a trader & i'm long but when the #market reverses I'm out here, while the buy & hope #investors stay & get crushed. #stocks

143 2018-08-09 22:40:45 They barely did, and bonds are 1/10 as volatile as gold, pay safe interest, and offer price stability in bear markets that you can sell instead of stocks. That’s gold’s issue: bond-like returns with stock-like risk; not a favorable combo
144 2018-08-09 22:40:22 From the 8 #stocks in technology sector that yesterday made all-time highs, picked these:

146 2018-08-09 22:39:10 But JC Parets says stocks are going a lot higher.  Noticed you follow him.
147 2018-08-09 22:37:04 Absolutely, as real #wages in the US is down & US capital investment has been declining for years margins would rise. But you know what happens if you stop reinvesting for growth the party eventually ends. #Stocks

152 2018-08-09 22:33:58 ...and they have been awarded growth multiples SUBSTANTIALLY above market value, even for large cap growth stocks. I know it's not a great comparison (it's hard to find a good one quite frankly), but I would call FRII's 30% growth pretty safe, at least until we enter recession.
153 2018-08-09 22:33:51 @CL_fTrader Well, I use TS 10 and It's quite different than 9. Execution is good. Charting is really good. I use Matrix (DOM), market depth and T&S. No problems. But again, I only trade stocks and options on that thing
154 2018-08-09 22:32:18 Fed hiking rates and reducing balance sheet.

Economy doing great. Stocks near all time highs.

Predictions of doom were 100% wrong.

156 2018-08-09 22:29:19 Someone needs to see if @NancyPelosi received insider tips when Mark Zuckerberg dumped stocks before the Cambridge Analytical scandal broke. Google her it shows that she owned many shares of Facebook.

So, expect prices rise.

That may mean the 2024 regression will come with hard hits on consumer spending.

164 2018-08-09 22:23:50  HOW TO TRANSLATE $HMNY BEAR TALK 101

A “Pumper” is someone that shares fact, information, & news that short-sellers don’t want people to know or like. 

 Bears never want anyone to share anything perspectively good with someone else that will keep sharing it with others!
165 2018-08-09 22:23:37 The problem is that the markets do not have adequate mechanisms in place to give stocks sufficient inertia to stop deliberate and accidental short term perturbations. So the big speculators run the show, a dangerous situation.
166 2018-08-09 22:23:22 I’ve heard some people suggest that Congress people being able to sit on boards (and maybe trade stocks at all) is setting up a corrupting situation. What are your thoughts about banning elected reps from holding outside positions?
167 2018-08-09 22:22:21 Bruce Willis is great exposure no matter how you look at it. Why do these Bears keep trying to twist everything into negative? Its to funny.
168 2018-08-09 22:22:03 A very bullish situation is being set up for winter 2018-2019. BUY natural gas stocks on any weakness periods.
169 2018-08-09 22:21:55 And bump stocks are banned btw...
170 2018-08-09 22:21:14 The only things that are close to sus is Critical Hit and Giga Bowser. But really it could just be critical hit because we didnt see Bowser's in a weakened state. Just increase the stocks to 4 or 5 and remove rage. It will all balance out.
171 2018-08-09 22:18:42 Learn how to pick stocks & do not use “index funds” which buy stocks blindly based on a definition of a basket of stocks. Also, cutting fees to zero is a good thing since managers make so much money each and every year.  When is the last time a mutual fund company lost money???
172 2018-08-09 22:16:32 Through the course of history, there have been 13 Fed hiking cycles of which 10 have ended with a recession, which is why investors need to remain nimble and cognisant in a rising rate environment (Jamieson Coote Bonds) #ausbiz #XJO #investing #bonds #equities #stocks

181 2018-08-09 22:11:17 Alot of people have asked me recently about the danger of options. They have heard that most option traders lose their money and they wanted to know is that true. It absolutely is true! If you can't produce consistent returns trading stocks or ETF'S, then don't trade options…
182 2018-08-09 22:11:04 1.Proclaim everything a success, go home. 
2.Ignore clear evidence to contrary.

184 2018-08-09 22:10:25 It takes too much time. I own a number of stocks that I don't have to pay attention to. This much time consumption is only worth it for a big payoff and I don't see that until/unless q3 comes out bad.
185 2018-08-09 22:10:20 Sorry if I sound ignorant. I trade Canadian stocks and I can’t buy anything before the market opens.

189 2018-08-09 22:09:06 I was stoked to hear that… .at first. But I recommend looking at the director’s other movies (with Bruce Willis) and tell me if you heard of any of them. :(

I do hope this movie hits big. I want MoviePass to win.

200 2018-08-09 22:02:48 It’s not excess. The Swiss bank is collecting an infinite rate on the collection of dividends. They print out of thin air and buy stocks. No one is questioning them. You try it.
201 2018-08-09 22:02:43 He can find a way that doesn't involve duping fans/prospective season ticket holders into thinking we'll be competitive when mgmt won't even try to be.

How would you like it if I sold you penny stocks that I knew would crash because the owners of my firm are long? Same thing.
202 2018-08-09 22:02:40 ya, I got it, was confused, my position was closed, but didn't know it, DOH, don't deal with stocks that often, but got it now, thanks
203 2018-08-09 22:02:15 Seems reasonable, but this would only affect things like employment, etc.

Best way to fight SM:

1. Stop all trade w/ KSA (ISIS) 

2. Sanction 2 take US Stocks, including social media. 

3. Prosecute OPEC members 4 antitrust 

4. Allow 9/11 lawsuits, awarding stock to victims

205 2018-08-09 22:01:18 I know, right?  32 yrs in this biz- even working with some epic pieces of dung penny stocks at times- I've never seen a circus like this one.   Flabbergasted.

209 2018-08-09 21:59:26 Well like, if stocks are traded at an equal pace i feel like it kinda works

Player 1 takes first stock and is at 60%, Player 2 comes back at 0 and can use CC to take that stock type of thing

220 2018-08-09 21:53:05 Is there a science to this? Possibly, assuming you could precisely estimate the edge between #55 and #50, but you can't. So we use heuristics of x% bounds where we roughly know that stocks 50 to 75 are Ybps less than 1 to 50, etc.
221 2018-08-09 21:53:00 In this case, Trump is brow-beating, threatening industry heads into compliance. He's used tweets to pummel or reward stocks. Very authoritarian approach which has escaped attention because we assume industrialists naturally support such a leader. It's more complicated than that

258 2018-08-09 21:30:11 Yea, and true - though this won't compare to Walmart share value... At all. I know of other stocks doing business with Walmart and big billion dollar corporations and they're still wee ole penny stocks, some not even moving bullishly at all even since announcing the partnership.

1. Let the CHF go to 0.5 against the Euro and ruin their economy?
2. Let the resultant EUR reserves sit at -0.40%?
3. Use them to buy $ and get 15%+/year on stocks?

Choose.
261 2018-08-09 21:28:29 Ya I’ve been following but would be hesitant to invest into trendy tech stocks. Most hardware focused tech companies have done poorly in the public markets as most business, therefore investors, are focused on the reoccurring subscription model.

267 2018-08-09 21:24:38 Depends what you are looking for. Quick wins are always risky, lots of money into it could flood things out and dilute the payback. Im more of a long term index stocks person, building my money over time and in property.

3 ) Banks were going nuts and giving loans to anyone 07 vs Banks are extremely careful 18
280 2018-08-09 21:13:01 If it were a copy/pawte of smash 4 rage, I get the competitive argument for its removal. We just don't know how it would affect this meta yet. Helk, even adding stocks alone mitigated potential affects of rage since 2 stocks makes rage so much more prevalent.

investors tend to not heed signals at market peaks because the belief is that stocks can only go up from here. 

At bottoms,
 investors fail to “buy” as the overriding belief is the market is heading towards zero.

327 2018-08-09 20:55:20 so we should only buy the stocks that go up?
328 2018-08-09 20:55:05 So, buying tokens is harder or easier than buying stocks? Because buying tokens is all it takes to topple the platform. It seems like a hostile takeover would be easier on tokens than on old school stocks.

378 2018-08-09 20:31:15 1). IMO I think @elonmusk is doing what is best for the future of #Tesla and his team. The short sellers will quickly find a new replacement when #Tesla is out of play. As for me, I'm selling off some stocks to buy in, hopefully many more will follow.
379 2018-08-09 20:31:03 Nah, too exciting for me. Stocks like $OSTK and $TSLA have an emotional following and everyone seems to have an opinion on them. Generally they make for tough trading vehicles. They're both on my "do not trade" list.

413 2018-08-09 20:17:06 My ideal rule set for ultimate:

Rage off
Final smash meter off(unless they make them weaker)
3 or 4 stocks(test the game out for a bit then decide)

Game 1 go to a random tourney legal stage(since stages come first you can make sure you dont play a bad char for the stage)
1/2
414 2018-08-09 20:16:30 it kind of is...? because like...? reporting has always included editorializing, exempting the outlining of current events, stocks, etc. If you want just numbers then you may want to stick with the play by play, pal
415 2018-08-09 20:16:01 Wages are not up except for corporations and they are buying their own stocks back, every other country hates our president, we have no healthcare we are polluting more than were were 2 years ago we now have a massive fed debt we can’t believe anything the president says and more
416 2018-08-09 20:14:45 World stocks mixed but little changed: Europe +.1%; YS -.1%. Trade tensions with China minimizing impact of solid earnings. Real question is will tariffs affect economic growth & S&P earnings?  Likely not until at least 4Q , if then. Still, expect volatility & some consolidation.

420 2018-08-09 20:13:03 The only time right wing cares about deficits is when they need to scare up votes (and I do mean scare). They LOVE debt. They get interest on bonds & T-bills and dividends on their bank stocks. Lending to government is a much better deal for the rich than paying taxes.

423 2018-08-09 20:12:19 We need to try 3 stocks, rage off, no items from jump then try everything else afterwards so we can compare the other rule sets to the “normal” competitive one.

426 2018-08-09 20:10:41 If it's just a flashier way to take stocks and any char can do it once per match, I don't see the problem honestly, stop rushing in ignorant conclusions is what you should do

428 2018-08-09 20:08:53 It's got to be the current average price for a goal scorer. His stocks up. Would we get a PL or championship goalscorer for anything less. Or do we pay £5-10k a week for someone who might grab 8 goals a season. Had we not got 10m for brooks then I might feel differently
429 2018-08-09 20:08:42 that and too many bargain buyers just buying cause its low (.06 and lower) and not supporting it on the way up to actually holding gains.

432 2018-08-09 20:06:22 I think it is surprising a) that he did it b) that it had such a small, temporary effect. I've been shooting my mouth off for a while that you short stocks that are going down, not up ...

439 2018-08-09 20:04:31 My opinion: Smash Meters ON(hopefully they will get just a bit nerfed, we really have to see for this one), three stocks, rage OFF. For the sake of stage bans, we could have a huge stage list, but with stage "categories" being what you ban instead.

454 2018-08-09 20:00:00 No Final Smash
No Items
Stocks greater than 2 but less than 5 with an appropriate timer
Use all current legal stages across the series but with hazards off (maybe drop DL for FoD to start, can add it/others back later)
Rage off if possible

how fucking hard is this to understand

457 2018-08-09 19:59:22 Chargable Final Smashes probably won't be used since they won't be balanced well (though I'd love to see it). Stocks will be 3 I'm guessing. Rage will be off for sure. 

Stages is where it gets complicated but obviously the BF/FD clones just count as BF and FD.

463 2018-08-09 19:56:11 The stock market goes up and down daily. Plus, you need to have stocks most middle and lower class Americans do not. Unemployment will start to rise. Even if you listen to just regular news, a lot of companies will closed due to the tariffs.
464 2018-08-09 19:55:05 if your'e lazy just watching the averages, you'd think the market has been consolidating since january. if you're looking at stocks, the strongest ones have continued higher and are the furthest thing from rangebound

485 2018-08-09 19:47:53 Honestly
Depending on how fast final smashes charge/ how they build up charge they might not be so terrible for the meta
Like if the game were 3-4 stocks and you got a charge once or twice a game itd be neat

499 2018-08-09 19:43:00 That's why I suggested broad based index funds.  Such a fund is designed to spread the investment over a wide range of stocks and/or bonds.  The idea is that the fund tracks the general economy rather than specific companies.  You can (if you wish) pick a fund that is small cap.

510 2018-08-09 19:39:04 The best investment in Russia are Gazprom stocks.
511 2018-08-09 19:38:58 That's the point of it being an index fund AND being broad based.  For example, there is a fund that is based on 5000 stocks.
512 2018-08-09 19:38:58 My Tesla stocks just raped the shit outta me what the fuck Elon
513 2018-08-09 19:37:51 Schoop has a little K-Rod in him.  Sorry couldn’t resist. I did appreciate the banter last night.
514 2018-08-09 19:37:41 Lol easyyyyyyy. You were right about him. He’s a bum
515 2018-08-09 19:37:31 Friendly reminder that if you think final smashes are too strong, you're not playing with enough stocks.
516 2018-08-09 19:37:25 100% agree you on the incompetence of ownership. But by no means am I sheep if I boo a BULLS player. And yes I was a Jabari fan.
517 2018-08-09 19:36:57 Y tu puedas ver los resultados. Animandote a seguir con dicha suscripción. Que opcion es mas apetecible para el cliente???
518 2018-08-09 19:36:15 3 stocks 8 minutes
7-9 neutral stages with the rest being possible counter picks. No FS, No customs, Rage off (if possible)
 Stage morph is a gentlemen clause only with first game being one and one and loser gets to pick the 2 stages in the morph
519 2018-08-09 19:35:58 100% de acuerdo en que la formación es lo mas importante. Pero yo planteo 2 opciones: pagar 1000 euros (por ejemplo), para empezar a realizar un curso que no sabes lo que te va a aportar.
O pagar una cuota mensual... En la que se compartan operativas y formacion y tu...

522 2018-08-09 19:35:15 @Market_Dove yur language indicates what kind of loser u r. See now i know what kind of upbringing u have got. Feel sorry for u
523 2018-08-09 19:35:13 Sounds good. I forgot you are a bulls fan
524 2018-08-09 19:34:38 Then again you thought DJ Wilson was the man.

528 2018-08-09 19:33:08 I might be down for rage toggle if it’s in the immediate settings menu (with stocks and timer) but if it’s some kind of special smash then I don’t think so

this said, I’m for rage especially if it’s been toned down
529 2018-08-09 19:32:57 Horrible confusión de stocks con flujos
530 2018-08-09 19:32:30 Honestly, though, I think it'll test out that having metered supers isn't a big deal, and just means you can fit 4+ stocks into a round. It's not as if confirmable supers weren't already a huge thing with traditional FGs. The main confirmation to make is punishability on whiff.
531 2018-08-09 19:32:27 @salesforce new co-CEO ascends at a time the stocks is surging and as the company pushes to reach $23 billion in annual revenue by 2022
532 2018-08-09 19:32:18 Rage is way less BS in a traditional fighter. If you introduce blast zones and stocks it will create stuff like ZSS/Bayo BS
533 2018-08-09 19:32:11 #manappuram stock performance indicates business fundamentals. Last many months this stock has been in a range. Somethng wrong wth biz
534 2018-08-09 19:31:52 The world needs an armchair tax. If people can make billions of dollars holding stocks and doing nothing else while they relax in armchairs, they should pay higher tax rates than people who work for their money.
535 2018-08-09 19:31:36 Things are definitely going my way.  You should learn how to trade, and even a shit stock like nvcn can make you money.  Are you against money?  I've day traded penny stocks since 1997, and have done well enough that it's worth doing.  Go ahead.
536 2018-08-09 19:31:26 Hey investors don’t sell any chip stocks because the bullshit company Morgan Stanley just put a caution not not to buy but to sell. The reason why they did that is because need to buy the chip stocks cheaper and put them in their own portfolio to make themselves richer
537 2018-08-09 19:31:12 @One_up ... and what I say is all relative your time frame. Fundamentally I would never go long on such stocks.
538 2018-08-09 19:31:08 Also fails to disclose how he himself is profiting from foreign governments through corporate stocks he owns.
539 2018-08-09 19:30:16 Tip - A warning to the wise  is sufficient. Yes, there are honest legal posters. Don’t believe any post! Research all stocks. You are a smart investor who believes no one but the facts. Learn to read the Quarterly 10Q reports. I did, you can too, at the SEC Website free.
540 2018-08-09 19:29:04 This is what I was saying to my friend yesterday. Like you said, go into ultimate with sm4sh's ruleset, except for 3 stocks if the game is too fast, replace Dreamland with fountain of dreams and replace Lula with hazardless pokemon stadium since we dont need those stages anymore.

545 2018-08-09 19:25:49 @RobinhoodApp can’t believe a company that offers trading for crypto and stocks doesn’t have contact number, doesn’t check their social media, doesn’t respond to tickets in a while business day. Time to test @etrade . You don’t deserve to be a real broker
546 2018-08-09 19:25:44 Mr @segalink, Good evening sir and hope you had a nice day. I'm currently serving in Abuja and I deal on perfumes. I just got new stocks and I want to give you one as a gift to appreciate you for all you're doing for the common people of Nigeria.
547 2018-08-09 19:25:38 Invest in fractional stocks from your phone.
548 2018-08-09 19:24:15 just bought 3 stocks for the #OGIB portfolio--including two #oil producers who are growing so fast...and paying out their well cost so quick...the Market isn't pricing any of it in...of course, it's not pricing much in #energyland - and my first OFS stock in a long time
549 2018-08-09 19:23:45 could argue folks fleeing EM and buying US stocks and bonds, but all this is happening on no volume.  last i read, algos are YUGE in fx now.  USD went to max short to start the year to max long now. CTA's, HF's momo algos..all the same thing to me
550 2018-08-09 19:23:24 I don’t trust anything anymore...if SNAP can rise 10% and fall 18% in 8 hours, all stocks are vulnerable.
551 2018-08-09 19:22:31 You are suggesting your own awards as reference ! I'd check stocks prices & get back to you.
552 2018-08-09 19:22:03 i think u mean capital flows - algos dont run rampant in fx like to they do in futures/stocks/etc
553 2018-08-09 19:21:56 As well, members of Congress can sit on such boards but are prohibited from drawing a salary.  And as his stocks were invested in the Aussie exchange he was not able to dump his shares like the others, whose investments were in the U.S. exchange. Mother Teresa he's not!

557 2018-08-09 19:21:00 Thats easy to say when stocks are in proper companies backed by products, services etc. Lot of us are in all the small cap projects which are just ideas and are now at 90%+ down and if we stay in bear market for much longer, they will never ever recover and only btc survises.
558 2018-08-09 19:20:39 No, nylon sheets, blankets and candlewick bedspreads will be obligatory. Apparently the Government are building up stocks by raiding charity shops.
559 2018-08-09 19:20:38 Does anyone remember two Fridays from tomorrow in $QQQ Tech stocks. Nasdaq is going to close higher for what the 7th straight day on abysmally low volume. Nothing to worry about right?
560 2018-08-09 19:20:37 So glad that when I go to Sainsbury's later they will have stocks of tinned mackerel precisely because of my demand for tinned mackerel as a buyer.
561 2018-08-09 19:19:59 You seem to be rationale to say you have #FBPE after your name. You mention pharma transport and planes not been able to fly. If there was a grain of truth in those Remain project fear stories the associated stocks of companies in those fields would have tanked. They haven’t???

568 2018-08-09 19:16:50 This is a real question: Can stocks even go down? I've been investing for 10 years and I'm now accustomed to 30% gains ever year. It's nice, but I thought this wasn't supposed to be so easy. Please advise. #CNBC
569 2018-08-09 19:15:35 Make it into four stocks and lower the time. It'll encourage aggressive play.

Also make them dodgeable and blockable.
570 2018-08-09 19:15:26 I don't play with shorts on specific stocks, but you seem to have nailed this one. Congrats!
571 2018-08-09 19:15:18 Charlie doesn’t determine the success of litecoin. He’s just a guy, litecoin will continue to exist and function regardless of what he does or says. People still think that crypto is stocks
572 2018-08-09 19:14:18 trade war escalates substantially from here, as Chinese stocks have learned the hard way: likelihood of trade wars has increased tension and the impact on equities has been marked, for example by early July the Shanghai Composite index had dropped some 22% from peak in January
573 2018-08-09 19:13:48 ‘M-my stocks are doing g-good at least h-haha’

575 2018-08-09 19:13:31 And if China is taken out of the picture, wheat ending stocks could be down 20% from last year.

591 2018-08-09 19:07:45 Unlike most stocks, the case for longs in tesla isn't really a financial one, of course they believe that tesla will become profitable, short term profit isn't nearly as much a part of the reason why longs hold the stock as longs of other stocks.

643 2018-08-09 18:37:08 If you want a shortcut to finding stocks that can move that day w/ very little effort... get @TradeIdeas1 and create a simple earnings scan. It won't be active every day; but when it's earnings season... serious potential. Should take 5-10 min's to setup if that.
644 2018-08-09 18:37:06 Has an evil twin called Stocks. Goatee. Manipulates the stick out of Sticks. Puts people in stocks to get bank details, hides the crimes at charity fundraising events where teachers get hit by wet sponges.
645 2018-08-09 18:36:41 Don’t rule yourself out 
646 2018-08-09 18:36:13 order now while stocks last!
647 2018-08-09 18:35:36 That you think Woodford or Michael Bigger or $NWBO executives would not know of such a “new” change just speaks to your credulity, or are these intentional efforts to deceive? In my opinion, the latter, since you post on many stocks, but only this one do you post this nonsense.
648 2018-08-09 18:35:35 I mean there are characters in other fighting games who have no neutral besides Super/Burst/Mode. 
Honestly I think that if any of the supers still guarantee an instant kill from zero and/or meter being maintained through stocks would determine it's legality.
649 2018-08-09 18:34:30 adding to $HTGM and $CWH  have to deploy some cash and these 2 cab really go... if the stocks not moving GET THE F&*(K OUT   NEXT
650 2018-08-09 18:34:08 stocks looking very bullish
651 2018-08-09 18:33:30 it‘s a market of stocks, not a stock market!
not sure which stock drops how much... therefore more a single stock question
652 2018-08-09 18:33:28 "Whenever the market starts to move down, many investors panic, and decide to change their allocations or even get out completely."

657 2018-08-09 18:31:14 Pretty rich considering Nancy Pelosi got rich through insider trading of Visa stocks.... she is a hypocrite and a crook!!
658 2018-08-09 18:31:05 You’re engaging in a false light campaign. Just want you to clearly understand that reality. All brokerages generally warm their retail investors about “penny stocks” with a similar warning. Perhaps there is a reason why your brokerage is not going to let YOU buy or sell...?
659 2018-08-09 18:30:56 $LCLP 0.0012 huge ask hits!
660 2018-08-09 18:30:23 You know it might be, generally stocks go down when the Founder\CEO steps down, but with Musk the market may think its a positive.

667 2018-08-09 18:29:20 I bought at $200... $300, $500, $1000, $5000, and then on the downswing at $8,000.

Been mining since '13...

I have a variety of coins, metals and stocks.

You're pretty presumptious to assume I bought at $20k and even more so to not understand at +10% move would be a good thing

679 2018-08-09 18:21:12 I'm definitely leaning hard towards no final smashes but it kinda depends how many stocks we play with, 4 stock final smashes feels a helluva lot more justifiable than 2 stock
680 2018-08-09 18:20:17 Made more in stocks, join the stock market if you want more money
681 2018-08-09 18:20:03 Follow the money. Always. GOP are corrupt, greedy, indecent, criminal traitors. They probably have stocks in related businesses. GOP & their unscrupulous corporate co-conspirators need to be held accountable for their crimes against our nation. Their wealth is mostly illegtimate.

689 2018-08-09 18:17:17 Very smart move. The mistake most people make is waiting until they are older to start. Put a small percentage of your work earnings into stocks all your life and you will be in great financial shape later.
690 2018-08-09 18:17:01 Ditto the dunking stool and stocks. Drawing and quartering and guillotine use should be keft to the states. Executions should be televised.
691 2018-08-09 18:16:46 “Although price changes for construction materials in July were mixed, contractors are likely to be hit with additional cost increases as new tariffs take hold and stocks of items purchased before the tariffs are used up,” says AGC of America’s chief economist, Ken Simonson.
692 2018-08-09 18:15:12 Enjoy prison, dude! Hey did the wife and son’s fiancé rat them out? DOJ said wife & fiancé dumped their stocks too, but didn’t say that they lied, like they did re: Congressman and his son.
693 2018-08-09 18:14:37 Good point - though I'd think it depends on the culture of the company, the leadership and stage they are in, as much as the size. I have had diff instances where employees held company stocks in their retirement portfolio; some panned out better than the others.
694 2018-08-09 18:13:43 I read “stocks” as “socks”

697 2018-08-09 18:12:08 We didn't have the ability to easily update product stocks with our previous website. Part of the reason we just launched a new website.
698 2018-08-09 18:12:01 you can also only look at stocks that are up less than 10% in the last 3months but yet are 15-25% from their 52week highs. --Many different ways.

703 2018-08-09 18:08:56 That's exactly what this is about. What Stocks do after Earnings are announced is totally unpredictable but after the initial reaction they tend to settle down into a quieter zone
704 2018-08-09 18:08:54 While Planned Gifts (I assume on death?) are good, I'm talking about spontaneous gifts from those who own stocks.
Seriously, when I saw online that @splcenter took stocks, I donated a whole lot more.
705 2018-08-09 18:07:46 Truth in what you said. VIX and Gold being no reaction (AS USUAL) and indexes firming. This is a WS that believes nothing (especially the CB) will harm equities move higher. CB live to save stocks from dying.
706 2018-08-09 18:07:46 None of them.  Not the Kochs, nor Sheldon A., nor Grover N.   They invest in GOP stock, because they need more, more, MORE.   And they got a big dividend.   Now we are watching for Putin’s stocks to split ...
707 2018-08-09 18:07:42 Short sellers are awful people, but this is just fine....

713 2018-08-09 18:05:39 Do you have a breakdown of which bracket gets taxed the most.... how does ur plan treat passive income.... CEOs/VCs are paid a low salary but their wealth comes in stocks.... so how do you tax the uber wealthy....

715 2018-08-09 18:04:44 How heavily traded was the Innate stock? For stocks with low trading volumes and no market makers, book price moves are common when volumes surge or fall.

775 2018-08-09 17:45:11 "Whether socks or stocks, I like buying quality merchandise when it is marked down." - Warren Buffet

You have to be paying attention to the prices of what you believe are quality products to enact this advice. Observation and delayed gratification!
776 2018-08-09 17:44:39 Market is definitely different now. Looking at the $DJUSNS, money didn't immedietaly flow back into the #FAANG stocks and looks to have topped at the end of July with a nasty candle.
777 2018-08-09 17:44:09 Long term investing is in vogue among newcomers. Even a lorry of sand appreciated double of any top pick in stock market. Get real get sensible. Many stocks which were top nifty stocks have gone down 90% over period of time. Buy and watch like an eagle rather than forgetting.

783 2018-08-09 17:40:00 Ah, no problem at all! I was waiting for your book to become available at Amazon US, once Amazon BR stocks are related to there. Then, I was going to buy here (BR), but the prices were doubled #shock

814 2018-08-09 17:28:48 My thoughts...3% stocks are the nurturing ground..We sense that they have lot of potential and hence are on the watch list for future upgrade..8-10% are stalwarts who may not give phenomenonal returns but have predictable earnings and protect huge volatility in portfolio
815 2018-08-09 17:28:44 $TROV has a very limited trading range over the last week. Would love to see $1.00 or high in the near future. Has had a few upswings recently of double digits percentage gain. I'm not usually one to gamble with penny stocks but I'm taking a risk here.

827 2018-08-09 17:23:14 Agreed, my thought was that trend on stocks seems like it should outperform but it doesn't because it only goes to beta of 1. This would allow the beta to gove above 1 when desired and should lead to outperformance (theoretically).
828 2018-08-09 17:22:48 @VOXmarkets are there any improvements planned to charting on the mobile app for stocks? The charts are not very user friendly.
829 2018-08-09 17:20:42 There's a lot of financial prep/budgeting courses available (Dave Ramsey, Michelle Singletary, etc) but do yall know of any investment prep courses? Classes that focus on stocks, CDs, retirement planning, etc?

834 2018-08-09 17:17:27 You should look at stocks below 10$.
They have much higher % gain and are Not less predictable like some like to advertise. Most likely its big money wanting us to trade the large cap , because they cant get filled in lower ones(mostly)
835 2018-08-09 17:17:21 Yo! Good observation. I missed that... well then I guess meter seems busted. It sounds like you could almost fill the meter at least once per stock. If it was once every 2 stocks that's understandable, but not every stock. That's OP! And it doesnt reset after a stock loss!

907 2018-08-09 16:47:08 A long term holding of real estate, stocks and cash savings I believe is necessary to build wealth. Savings alone will always be degraded by inflation unlike the other two wealth builders, the key is to hold both real estate and stocks for life, most lack the stomach to do.
908 2018-08-09 16:47:07 And their wealth has gone up. A lot. Think of it this way: a worker’s wealth is priced in the value of labor. A 1%er’s wealth is in homeS and stocks. Homes & stocks are priced in dollars. Print more $, and the value of homes & stocks rises. While globalization depresses wages.

1036 2018-08-09 15:52:15 A big factor is the US tax change - maybe 20pts or more - that was not priced in.  Another factor is re-rating, hard to forecast when many of these stocks are “expensive”.  What is difference in actual Pretax earnings versus consensus/market implement forecast  over the LTM?
1037 2018-08-09 15:52:02 were the other R's who owned those stocks at Collins information-did they also sell early?

1044 2018-08-09 15:49:04 Right, and I agree. But I'm trying to understand whether it's really fair to say that all dapp tokens are worthless, by first understanding if the same logic applies to stocks/shares, and if they're even fundamentally all that different.
1045 2018-08-09 15:48:33 Ye, new stages but not too many

No point holding them for the next 5-10 years, if the CAGR returns from 2008 is around that of the nifty!
1070 2018-08-09 15:39:45 @CNBCnow @CNBC it's IRONIC  that the more CNBC shows Dorsey on the Hannity show the HIGHER the TWTR stocks goes. Do you think every investor agrees with your liberal bias?

1074 2018-08-09 15:38:47 @samuelruss It's not a stock that I follow and quite frankly just too many other better setups/stocks to be in I think.
1075 2018-08-09 15:38:27 I don't get it; you bought your first position at the top? Why did you not scale in or do more due diligence? Biotech stocks often rise & fall, & some rise "even greater" on the way back up.  I would argue there is "even more greater potential now" over buying at 2014 lows. $ZIOP

1141 2018-08-09 15:11:37 Doesn’t the level of businesses being disrupted in this cycle mean that correlations should be lower? Old economy stocks suffering, disruptive companies benefitting.

At the same time, doesn’t the low correlation go against the argument that this is a passive flows driven rally?
1142 2018-08-09 15:10:48 Danger then is that people do then opt out or pushes businesses to the brink.

5% and low opt outs is a good step forward. 

Get to 8% and then see what's what once that's bedded in.
1143 2018-08-09 15:10:33 One of my favorite ways to play $HMNY is: When the #stockchart starts to turn bullish, I add many small limit buys under the Bid, then quickly add a few other small limit-buys between the Bid & Ask, slightly above the Bid.

1179 2018-08-09 14:57:51 All right a young client comes to D&M Investments. Tells us he already has some money tied up in index funds - he’s got 10k he wants to invest in individual stocks. He tells us he doesn’t care what companies as long they’re not pennies and we beat the market. What stocks we pick?

1300 2018-08-09 14:12:41 People, things, stocks the weather, etc. cannot upset you without your permission. It can only happen if you believe it can upset you. These "things" are just doing what they do; all you control is how you respond to them. If you want to be successful and happy., work on that!
1301 2018-08-09 14:12:35 Pay up or go to single screens. The business class has a firm grip on rule makers and can get their way. They hire the best legal brains to twist and torture the arguments in their favour.
1302 2018-08-09 14:12:23 The way this market has changed in the one year I've been doing this has been a crazy ride.
I also switched from small caps to mid / large caps and couldn't be happier.

But the stocks that moved last month aren't moving at all this month so I need to change for summer trading

1312 2018-08-09 14:09:13 You would think. But it's because of scums who invest in Procter & Gamble or Johnson & Johnson stocks who override the moral obligation especially when a product is clearing causing harm to people

1323 2018-08-09 14:04:54 Hi commie, shorting of stocks usually plays as important a role in the discovery of price as long positions. It is particularly good in correcting prices overvalued by a class of investors living inside group think.

But psychologically, i lack patience to hold my winners beyond 5x returns. So its not stock selection skills but sitting that makes u rich!

1444 2018-08-09 13:10:49 Not according to the last 100 years of history which the S&P has increased at much higher rate than inflation. Majority of Americans have nothing in stocks.  The rich do. That's why the rich keep getting richer. Game is rigged, be on rigged side (Own Stocks)

1543 2018-08-09 12:15:12 I agree but at 25 neither do we have skills to find such stocks nor huge amount to invest. yes, there are some who are extraordinarily talented or born with silver spoon and such rare species will earn money and fame in any field.
1544 2018-08-09 12:14:01 This is the most corrupt administration ever.  All congress members and administration officials should be required to put their investments in a blind trust and be prohibited from trading stocks.  Only then will we see congress working for us.
1545 2018-08-09 12:13:15 There’s no law that says senators or reps can’t hold stocks. Also are you labeling anyone who owns stock as corrupt? So you don’t see the difference btwn stock owning and insider trading? Can’t believe you’re lecturing after you ran Alito/Roberts conf who’ve voted for corruption
1546 2018-08-09 12:13:03 He is on the board and did not sell his own stock.  The crime was his telling his son the stocks were about to lose value before everyone else knew...and the son dumped his stock and told others who dumped. All very Martha Stewart.
1547 2018-08-09 12:12:51 You know everywhere I look, i can create a rational decision as to why I dislike the market/economy, but im still long stocks and long bonds - no matter what, if prices keep going up, you cant stay out (until the very end though).

It was irresponsible at best.

1560 2018-08-09 12:05:51 That is great! And who is running the VA? And how much did they make on insider trading while they were dictating contracts? Are you involved? Do you hold stocks in any of those companies? Oh! And your buddy Devin is on tape! Lordy! #shotacrossthebow
1561 2018-08-09 12:05:24 A year or so ago they tried partnering with Ola to dump all the Micras and that did not fly through. Now we will have to endure all their 'sports' and 'limited edition' releases till the stocks clear.
1562 2018-08-09 12:05:20 Owning stocks is risky in short term. 
Not owning stocks is risky in long term.
1563 2018-08-09 12:04:59 That's happening to some extent to Tesla but Musk is primarily robbing his investors - who will have nothing when this carnival collapses. Musk only owns 20% of Tesla stocks. He is an *employee* of the Tesla shareholders and they can fire him. That's what you seem to miss.

1566 2018-08-09 12:03:37 I’ve got a decent portfolio. Played it safe though. Spread across 4 Australian blue chip stocks. I’ve got a share trading account with ANZ. Everything is on DRP. Compounding nicely. By the time I retire it will be very handy. 

When I purchased I considered GW. Was too risky tho

1572 2018-08-09 11:59:38 Using margin is ok for short term day trades, you can leverage and be out fast.  Holding a lot of stocks on margin is just flat out stupid.  Margin fees are huge, plus things go wrong, you lose a ton of equity, very fast, especially on 3x margin.  Thats just dangerous and stupid.

1675 2018-08-09 10:49:26 @ByronBernstein I really loved the stocks talk/stream the other day. I have been reading a lot about it lately and I am looking to start investing soon. I would love to get into some DMs with you and hear some of your thoughts. Also love the new Byron stay positive my dude.

1687 2018-08-09 10:34:15 Why do you say so? QoQ and YoY, the numbers look good. Did it miss expectations?
1688 2018-08-09 10:33:51 Personally I think that this is a good thing. The only thing that I’m concerning about is the money. Tesla relies on stocks for money let’s be honest.
1689 2018-08-09 10:31:31 One last thought with so many new follows. I have FEW convictions on stocks. I have LT accts mainly in bios. Sell periodically there. I trade everything else. Trade. No LT conviction. I trade vol mainly too.  As purist, DCFs are best. But practical me admits PEs are shorthand.

1691 2018-08-09 10:29:35 Also Jen, the majority of the tax cut $$, almost 1 trillion dollars, went directly to stock buy backs to push stock prices up. Unless you're in the 1% sitting on stocks, those tax cuts weren't meant for you.

Sooner or later that will become evident.

1695 2018-08-09 10:26:33 Why do some stocks fall down even after very good results?

In the short term, the expectations built into the price of the stock are more important than the actual performance of the company.

1697 2018-08-09 10:23:30 The traders who prefer large & mid cap stocks often choose these plays because:
1:they have increased liquidity
2:adhere more frequently to support & resistance 
3:reliability of fundamentals
1698 2018-08-09 10:23:15 Last time I checked, the demand for these 2 nendos are so high the price spiked 5x the original price for the last remaining stocks 
1699 2018-08-09 10:23:13 Tesla would have to but all publically traded stocks to go back into o being private, lots of risks for Tesla to look at!

1704 2018-08-09 10:18:32 Low float means that there are simply less available shares for trading. In the case of small-micro cap stocks this translates in to dramatic price fluctuations-
1705 2018-08-09 10:17:46 On the contrary, so glad I sold out of $RAD many months ago. How can the board run the company after they tried to sell it but shareholders said no thanks! Thats crazy! #stocks

1713 2018-08-09 10:13:26 Why do some traders prefer low float? Some bigger? Why do some traders prefer mid and large cap stocks? It’s simple really. These setups fit there individual trading style and have been profitable or...unprofitable but familiar. That’s my take away

1720 2018-08-09 10:06:13 Mr Zorba; you invested in the fund last year, you started complaining loudly about 1-2 stocks, I wrote email to you with explanation & also a note to all investors, you didn’t listen. You redeemed in 6 months. See the performance after your redeemed in haste.

1722 2018-08-09 10:04:22 actually the small caps haven't picked up much after their rise from mid july lows, so he is getting restless, i believe he might come up with recos among the large/mid cap stocks.

1748 2018-08-09 09:41:17 Bonjour, les magasins gèrent eux-même leurs stocks et leurs commandes donc on ne peut te dire à leur place...
1749 2018-08-09 09:40:31 If you think I was serious advocating use of the stocks, you are ;-) But I don't think you really think that.
1750 2018-08-09 09:39:58 Shoulda gone with “the ones that look like stocks”
1751 2018-08-09 09:39:45 Besides a house, a car, stocks, and giving money to charity? A ticket to Ibiza Spain for me and a couple of friends
1752 2018-08-09 09:39:17 Easiest research ever . Water sales, canned goods,  oil (contractors for clean up), battery , duct tape. All those stocks rise. The wealthy know where to put their money for any scenario.  I'm a fuggin money magnet.  I'll find money. And my advice is free. 
1753 2018-08-09 09:38:10 Watch our webinar on how to use MarketSmith India to build watchlist of top stocks. We also look at couple of names that are setting up well.
1754 2018-08-09 09:38:08 So it's possible I'm taking this way too seriously, but those are the arguments I'd advance. Support for the stocks is likely a response to the proposed "softness" of probation-based community sentences. But that's based on quite a narrow view of what makes punishment "tough".
1755 2018-08-09 09:36:53 Another objection on retributive grounds is that the stocks would bump up our punishment of offenders who've committed offences of intermediate severity, but not the treatment of prisoners or of those at the lower end. It's not clear where the stocks would fit on the penal scale.

1757 2018-08-09 09:34:42 Compare that with something like unpaid work in the community -- which was hyper-visualised by New Labour in the way that stocks are hyper-visible to the public. There you're at least doing something to improve the community -- or at least you can.

1761 2018-08-09 09:33:16 So you can ask, "What is the stocks trying to do in addition to punishing?" V briefly (& I'm happy to expand if you want) there's little evidence of a deterrent effect, it does nothing to rehabilitate, & it doesn't ensure reparation to the victims in any way.

1763 2018-08-09 09:31:47 Stocks are so annoying to me now.
1764 2018-08-09 09:31:15 For a conservative I think there are 2 possible objections to the stocks. Lilico talks about proportionality, in retributive terms -- so let's go with that. The basic point of retributive proportionality is to fix the DISTRIBUTION of punishment, not necessarily the content...

1771 2018-08-09 09:24:41 Downside could be cushioned by dividends/buy backs. If crude rises, the stock will come under pressure, no doubt about that. If you’re looking purely for statistically cheap stocks, you should pass this one.

1789 2018-08-09 09:15:17 Last one year has shown both that stocks which are rallying can fall and stocks which are falling can also fall some more. So, it doesn’t matter when you buy stocks as stocks both going up and down can fall after you buy. Price anchoring bias is a big investing mistake.

2056 2018-08-09 05:39:28 That's interesting to know. But I hope @BigHitEnt doesn't do that tbh. Investors like those who'd buy their stocks are only interested in money and I don't want our boys to work even more just so investors get more money. And it would be a contradiction to their concept right?
2057 2018-08-09 05:39:17 Stocks are overvalued. Stay away from the market because it’s going to get very ugly very fast. May not be tomorrow, next week, or even next month. But it’ll be within the next 6 months and the market crash is going to be ugly!
2058 2018-08-09 05:37:52 Yes, agree with that. My pt was 1 single factor can never be d answer here. We have to see quality [business + mgnt], price, AND holding period. But yeah a randomly selected 10-20 largecap stocks held over a longg period, should do well enuf. Not applicable to small/midcap tho

2064 2018-08-09 05:33:54 And yes its time to invest in stock market because soon some stocks like Rcom , SBI etc are going to push market on all time high
2065 2018-08-09 05:33:23 Unlike in the past, its important to note that not all index individual stocks are at record high prices. Though there's no thumb rule that market will exactly follow past trends, its just a caution advice to hold positions with tight SL.

2080 2018-08-09 05:24:25 Due to QE-strategy moneyprinting central banksters like BOJ, FED, ECB, etc. are buying not only their own state-bonds but also stocks on stock markets.

2091 2018-08-09 05:14:40 At least being a Board member prevented him from selling his own stocks. But there are also rules around communicating with people who are not entitled to insider knowledge.

2094 2018-08-09 05:10:22 I mean Knebel deserved to be an All Star last year, but something def different this year as you’ve pointed out in your K-Rod references. I think Knebel is still a solid weapon in the ‘pen but I would be more at ease if JJ were to step into closer role here on out.

2142 2018-08-09 04:28:00 When did Knebel set an MLB record by striking out 8 in 2 2/3 innings? When did Knebel come into a one run game in the 5th or 6th inning? He is not as versatile or valuable as Jeffrey’s or Hader, and not as reliable right now in a close game.
2143 2018-08-09 04:27:59 The stock market teaches many lessons. But one overarching lesson is this:

Unless the mkt as a whole rises, most stocks won’t rise. 

In my view, that’s applying AA’s principle:

“Our *common welfare* should come first; per- sonal recovery depends upon A.A. unity.”

2148 2018-08-09 04:25:21 You are ripping Kolb for making an all-star game, yet Knebel has accomplished little more than Kolb did? That hurts your argument. Kolb & Knebel were in All-Star game only because each team has to be represented. Hader got in on merit.

2150 2018-08-09 04:24:15 Trump only fights for Trump. A booming economy? The stocks are inflated because companies gave the tax cuts to their stock holders. Wages are stagnant. Most people won't notice the crumb tax cut and the tariffs will cause everything to cost more and jobs will be lost.

2165 2018-08-09 04:15:35 Why are those corporations taking that money and using it to buyback their stocks? Trickle down economics was a fantasy with Reagan and Trump's recycled version has reaped the same results corporate America is only concerned about itself and making more money.

2171 2018-08-09 04:12:34 True. I like the idea of them owning a basket of stocks (something like S&P mutual fund), so that they do better if economy does better. Incentives it. But individual stocks can be scary. Picking winners and losers.
2172 2018-08-09 04:12:13 All star game big deal I guess. Knebel made the all star last season but let’s not count that and did it for a full 162. He’s on pace for a similar season.  Long ball has hurt him.

Let me know when Dan Kolb is put into Brewer HOF for making an All Star team!
2173 2018-08-09 04:11:22 I just counted a little of my washi stocks last night and saw how little stocks I have left of streetnfood washi. Been thinking if should I reprint it or not.

2181 2018-08-09 04:07:14 How does he find the time for #TalkingPointsTour? oh, by avoiding actual forums with the people who actually live in #IL16, we are called 'constituents'. He doesn't think he has to earn our votes, he's a grifter see his slush fund and conflict of interest defense stocks.
2182 2018-08-09 04:07:06 Nobody wants to get paid in random stocks, so being paid in BTC if you're not already heavily involved in the market would be infuriating.
2183 2018-08-09 04:05:32 Selective stocks are moving up but the risk for retail investors is eventually when market encounters with correction then the stocks already corrected will also have to go through the pain and take the beating, can't predict how long the rally continue and correction begins..
2184 2018-08-09 04:05:12 Okay. Maybe your new girlfriend stocks you
2185 2018-08-09 04:04:19 If @realDonaldTrump  tweets in the morning that he's moving to @Gab by Friday Twitters stocks tank 20% or more.

2186 2018-08-09 04:03:43 The staunching of financial bleeding has thankfully begun. Aided also by a profit of just slightly less than $200 on the Exchange today. I'm getting good at picking stocks!

2212 2018-08-09 03:41:18 Oh, I don’t know. Maybe because Hader was reliable for 100+ games and made the All-Star team while Knebel has struggled all season, dating back to blown save in season opener. He rarely pitches a clean inning.

2217 2018-08-09 03:39:47 I think the lack of liquidity is a big factor

There are some stocks that im not 100% convinced on the fundamentals but if it’s liquid and trading volume I will usually jump in for a punt anyway
2218 2018-08-09 03:38:58 He goes to Hannity and keeps Jones because the censoring is hurting their companies stocks, just like Facebook. When you are being attacked for censoring conservatives than you interview with them to show you’re not trying to be politically bias. Or it will feed the outrage.

2236 2018-08-09 03:29:50 There's a very real issue here.

I now understand why people turn bears. Some stocks just get delusional. Go private at $420 having never posted an annual profit. Laughable.

2239 2018-08-09 03:28:51 Well, it depends on the style of trading. 
For example, for a Momentum Trader, a breakout above 60 on RSI, (could be different for different stocks), is considered good buying entry point.

2244 2018-08-09 03:26:55 The truth is if you look at the institutional holdings.. almost none of them sold!! In fact many new institutional holding filings have continuously been made!

SMH  YOU ARE EITHER CLUELESS or A DUMB BEAR
2245 2018-08-09 03:26:28 “All hedge or institutions that manage over $100M are required by the SEC to file quarterly reports. Filings are required the following quarter from the reporting period, which means that by the time the filing is made (and we see them), the information could be five months old”
2246 2018-08-09 03:26:12 Not only fish/seafoods ang prob.  Since nag for gud na ko d2 sa Pinas, now ko lang nakita na paubos na rin ang bigas d2 sa province namin. Ilang gilingan na ang close dahil wala na silang stocks na bigas & even d1 & darak for our alagang hayop. If meron man double na ang price.
2247 2018-08-09 03:25:54 I would ONLY be okay with this if ALL final smashes kill at the same percent as a good hitbox uncharged smash attack.

also would need to be 3 or 4 stocks.

aka not till like 75%+
2248 2018-08-09 03:25:00 You should at least be able understand how to read these filings if you are posting them. Btw, I am long here, but all these institutional holders got wiped out unless they were holding preferred shares and the data in that filing is over a month old.
2249 2018-08-09 03:24:36 D) a good chunk of my and many peoples  pensions are tied up in insurance stocks. Teachers, public unions, manufacturing, not to mention 401Ks   so is there a plan to reimburse us when those stocks take a deep dive?
2250 2018-08-09 03:24:35 Nah. The explanation was a little weird, but basically it's group versus group. If you see the diagram they showed, each character is being used by a different player- they aren't stocks

2270 2018-08-09 03:12:13 Investors post about some stocks they were holding which grew like 100 times. Most of the times I have not even heard about the stock. Moreover even after the stock grew 100 times its hard to find the details. How do you pick such stock?? @porinju
2271 2018-08-09 03:11:43 Being with a company a long time shouldn’t net you anything but the pricing and service you agreed to have. If you care to have a return on your investment besides what you signed up for you should consider buying stocks.

2290 2018-08-09 03:00:52 2 stocks is one of the few unanimous decisions the community has made to NOT enforce. 

Given everything we've seen, it simply would not be practical to continue with 2 stock.

2295 2018-08-09 02:53:50 Also right now there aren't rules for smash ultimate, it's always done by local TO's. There's generally a baseline for a while.
No items
X amount of stocks
X amount of time
ONLY x amount of stages because they're the only "fair stages"
Some are starters, and other counterpicks.

2303 2018-08-09 02:51:06 Brother i use stocks as well, bur i put twists to them to make them somewhat original, like the Nitroh one i just did my manipulation, colored and added the shading. Alot of my work has stocks, but i find them myself i dont use packs.
2304 2018-08-09 02:48:20 In India index is giving the impression of roaring bull market,  making new high everyday but broader market almost in bear market and 08 highfliers at fraction of their highs.. reason I entirely agree with about concentrating stocks rather than index and when we were in sideways
2305 2018-08-09 02:47:21 We are always honest to market. Talk the market down? We are private company not working for govt. You can check the soymeal stocks carried by crushers in China. Crushers are carrying high stocks and they urge buyers who booked soymeal by basis contracts to deliver their goods.

2313 2018-08-09 02:44:18 This one really irks me.  Wilbur Ross allegedly stole over $120M from companies, and a variety of former partners.

He lied. He held onto several stocks, and even shorted one he said he thought he owned.
A lie.

I propose that holding office is a public servitude and stock buying or selling should be forbidden whatsoever while holding office.

2413 2018-08-09 01:53:00 They say ending stocks are relatively, large and the market has a tendency to quickly correct itself because wheat can grow on the moon.
2414 2018-08-09 01:52:23 Yes they are! They voted against a bill that would've prevented them from owning stocks that presented a clear conflict of interest. That tells you all you need to know right there. Same folks who forced us to have ObamaCare, but voted against it for themselves.

If you look at my past tweets, it’s clear to see I post these filings as they are published sometimes, multiple times a day.
2417 2018-08-09 01:51:24 No different in stocks.  You will hardly ever see gaps on lower timeframes unless the stock is just not liquid enough.

2421 2018-08-09 01:50:26 I hope some ARMYs living comfortably buy stocks so we have some control over how BigHit treats our boys, JUST IN CASE. Even if something goes wrong, we would be sure our boys would atleast have someone watch their back.

2432 2018-08-09 01:45:07 My stream videos tend to cover a broader range of topics, they may interest you. I've been a bit quiet on content recently due to other things in my life getting in the way, but I'd love to get some basic videos out about why I support different stocks and cryptos.
2433 2018-08-09 01:45:00 @Mick3y there are TONS of stocks that have increased 100%+ with 90%+ buy and strong buy analysts.
2434 2018-08-09 01:45:00 I'd rather them not.  So should investors.  Markets are information.  When people with no skin in the game start buying, they shrink the quality of the information.  Pundits and newspapers will say the buying will boost stocks.  Quite the opposite.
2435 2018-08-09 01:40:50 Sir is there any similar manual for Indian stocks ?
2436 2018-08-09 01:39:48 In stocks also? All time frames?
2437 2018-08-09 01:38:29 Excellent question! I actually wanted to get into stocks for years &never felt confident enough to do so. I got into crypto in 11/17 and thought I should learn TA. So I studied 24/7 and ended up being ok at it.
I will probably explore traditional finance stuff in the near future
2438 2018-08-09 01:36:10 All Work and No Vol Makes Jack a Dull Boy.

So much for new records. Yesterday's optimism is nowhere to be seen, with stocks trading close to where they were at Tuesday's close.
2439 2018-08-09 01:35:10 Quick question: why did you choose to apply TA to crypto rather than stocks, currencies or commodities?

2449 2018-08-09 01:27:47 1/2. Just an aside, I just went thru about 250 resource stock and commodity charts.  IMO (and I get it wrong now and then), resource stocks are about to turn / put in a solid bottom and have at least a fairly significant short covering rally, if not a trend change.
2450 2018-08-09 01:27:01 Seriously JC? Tom is making a simple divergence point. Are you seriously not grasping his point or are you pretending ignorance? Very few stocks making new high vs Jan means breadth is much thinner compared to Jan. That doesnt mean market falls tomorrow - just a concern...
2451 2018-08-09 01:24:43 we agree it is a felony and rightfully banned however that the weapons can be modified makes my point. If  Dems were in power the bump stocks would be included as illegal modifiers. BTW Jim can take care of himself and doesn't need my help.

2454 2018-08-09 01:22:23 Yes. Banning you won’t hurt them. Banning these people will trigger others to cancel their accounts. Which will impact their stocks. Their stock value is based on bullshit data anyways. Twitter has no value. Alex Jones gets banned thousands of his followers leave. So fuck twitter

2464 2018-08-09 01:16:55 Every marketplace including stocks and forex has pump and dump “manipulation”. Crypto has thinner order books making it easier. Let’s not pretend these problems are new or crypto specific. Let’s also not dismiss the entire field as made of crooks.
2465 2018-08-09 01:16:44 Imo for Smash Ultimate we should have 5 stocks, 10 minutes, items on, all stages allowed, banning goes 20/10/20/pick, and Final Smash meter on.
2466 2018-08-09 01:16:00 How on gods green earth does a NYS state representative earning approx $100-200K yr obtain foreign stocks worth MILLIONS OF DOLLARS in the first place???? We know the answer to this DC scourge against US taxpayers!!!!
2467 2018-08-09 01:15:59 There are companies making 100s of millions in profits, and barely any of that money returns to the economy. It’s saved, or used to buy back stocks, which has a minimal effect on the economy in comparison to a wage increase
2468 2018-08-09 01:15:37 夏休みじゃねぇ...
2469 2018-08-09 01:15:24 Totally agree with this.  Alts are tough as a equity replacement.  Better (in terms of ability to garner investor commitment) as a tool to "diversify your diversifiers" in the risk mitigation bucket or as an overlay that can be applied on top of, not as a replacement for, stocks

Nope. She doesn’t eat the food, not all of them.

2479 2018-08-09 01:01:33 No. Giving news and a target for buying stocks to go private isnt manipulation. If, a big if, Tesla stays public after this I think it could turn into something more. At least a short investigation.
2480 2018-08-09 01:01:03 So the people he wants to buy his product are whiners? Such great PR from that individual.
As MSM continues to cosy up to LNP their stocks continue to drop.
2481 2018-08-09 01:00:47 Except members trade individual stocks all the time, often related to their donors and committee assignments. It's hiding in plain sight.
2482 2018-08-09 01:00:45 They should look at all the Democrats starting with John Kerry who immediately bought health related stocks right after the passage of Obamacare that was probably insider trading to since they made the bill and then profited through the stock market.

2487 2018-08-09 00:58:53 Just because it takes about 10 min. to modify an AR-15 into an assault weapon. Perhaps you missed those stories about bump stocks and related gadgets. Also, fuck you and the treasonous NRA. And @swatter911 too.
2488 2018-08-09 00:57:13 Please make sure to point out he could not sell his shares since they are in the Australian Stock Market and all stocks in the company were frozen. I have only heard this once today and it needs pointed out after his claim in his press conference that he is not guilty.
2489 2018-08-09 00:57:07 You could get that kind of return in stocks, annuities and such
2490 2018-08-09 00:56:06 That's right! I was just remembering when I advised a community college fund to get the majority of their funds out of stocks. They didn't take my advice and lost about $20 million. Sorry. You're right.
2491 2018-08-09 00:55:35 Next step, spot market starts to run dry. Utility inventories drawn down. Fuel buyers uncertain what to do (in the US)....then panic. $200/lb by late 2020. See it coming a mile off. U stocks will not be undervalued for much longer.
2492 2018-08-09 00:55:04 But Mike!  People are predicting Gold is going to $10,000.00!!!!11  That is a helluva trend!!!!!!111   And hyperinflation and stocks will crash 90% and the only think worth anything will be precious metals and seeds from Alex Jones online store.

2496 2018-08-09 00:53:37 They did tell her to do something about the millions of medical device and pharma stocks she and her husband hold. This is not a good look and hope she heeds their advice. Many in the DFL establishment turn the other way on potential conflicts of interest but Painter did not.
2497 2018-08-09 00:53:24 im sayin do 4 stocks w/ meter, test the waters, then if its a bad idea go back to 3 stock no FS
2498 2018-08-09 00:53:21 Yeah then JD Fenix can be an echo fighter. The difference would be Sagat's shotgun ignores all stocks and eliminates the player with a good shot, JD does 83% per body

Anyone who understands anything about companies, stocks, heck...making,selling, AND delivering cars, knows TSLA will b a 0
2502 2018-08-09 00:49:58 ... and that shall suffice for today. Thursday does tend to favour the bears, so some degree of cooling is due. Most stocks are suggestive of a broader straight run into mid/late Sept', rather than a retrace to the sp'2760s.

2503 2018-08-09 00:49:56 So, because he wished that the MS drug had worked, and he did some "good things", ignore the fact that his family dumped the stocks?Does that about summarize his argument?
2504 2018-08-09 00:49:48 Really should have a bill banning congressmen  from having stocks.  Banning citizens united would help keep the taint of money out, too.
2505 2018-08-09 00:49:05 If Blumpkins aren’t getting prepped for the draft it’s probably safe to short the stocks of fantasy magazine publishers #whatyearisit

@Tony4WI
2507 2018-08-09 00:48:23 if you bump it up to 4 stocks id say add the meter as actual competitive for a bit just to see if it flows well. if not, move down to 3 stocks and remove the meter
2508 2018-08-09 00:46:22 Yeah exactly, Like 4 stocks and metre wud be interesting. I'm sure TOs will test it out
2509 2018-08-09 00:44:36 Y’all ever just look at the stocks and wonder what it all means
2510 2018-08-09 00:44:33 @Mark_Walker I don't give a fuck about your life haha but that's great man, what stocks are all about
2511 2018-08-09 00:43:56 This just confirms why people don’t trust congressman.

2513 2018-08-09 00:43:39 Well, there is a wake-up call for you NY. Do you really want this guy around?

2519 2018-08-09 00:41:48 Why is Congress allowed to trade stocks anyway? There should be a ban on all trading from these corrupt SOBs. They can't work for the people when they are more interested in personal profit.
2520 2018-08-09 00:41:25 stocks is Evil.

2522 2018-08-09 00:40:53 hey. nerd alert but in my personal finance class we have a stock simulation game (real stocks, fake money) and rn I’m in second place. First is our instructor. I can’t believe I’m the next wolf of Wall Street.
2523 2018-08-09 00:40:10 I know, we were talking about googl. I was asking Jack since he said certain stocks way too easy.
2524 2018-08-09 00:39:39 I’m curious how #FascistMouthpiece @seanhannity will spin the arrest of Chris Collins? Was it Deep State? Did Barack and Hillary sell Collins the stocks? Was it Squidward?
2525 2018-08-09 00:39:36 Why the seedy marketing Jim? I lose respect every time I get these:
“I Must Share Disturbing News”I couldn’t live with myself if I didn’t warn you...

Whether or not you hold any stocks, bonds, cryptos, or ETFs, you need to see this video now.

Ignore it at your own peril.

2527 2018-08-09 00:36:38 I pay a lot more than 12% & i am not rich, the rich are not paying their fair share, they pay alot but why should my effective rates be higher than theirs, also they make most of their money through stocks so they arent paying social security & medicare taxes like the rest of us
2528 2018-08-09 00:36:13 Thats true. They would need to fix Critical Hit, but also keep in mind there are much stronger grab combos that aren't banned in other smash games. Worst case its like a rest combo every two or three stocks.
2529 2018-08-09 00:35:44 Please explain why Collins didn’t/couldn’t sell his stocks.  He made a big deal of that tonight - he didn’t sell his stock
2530 2018-08-09 00:34:43 The POS and his little shitnugget son were trading in pumpNdump penny stocks and the like...

There is MORE than enough of proof already. Just toss him and his minions in prison for twenty years.
2531 2018-08-09 00:34:03 Thought so. Used to own BAC stocks then option calls, always profits but don’t own any right now. Shame on me.
2532 2018-08-09 00:34:03 Do you mean, increase stocks here to lower prices and squeeze the short treasuries trade? What do they gain from it?
2533 2018-08-09 00:33:53 Rep. Chris Collins is talking about his scam that he pulled. He denies selling stocks and says he is innocent. He said he wouldn't answer any questions and run 2018. What a liar! They have tapes of you telling your son about the failure of drug. This guy is full og BS!!
2534 2018-08-09 00:33:35 I wouldn't know, I don't short stocks.
2535 2018-08-09 00:33:30 @realDonaldTrump #POTUS #ABCWorldNews #CBSEveningNews #GMA #CNN #foxandfriends #FoxNews #BBCnews It is interesting if you can recall that in March 22, 2010 When DNC Speaker Nancy Pelosi basically did the same thing with Healthcare stocks and the FBI did nothing, strange indeed?
2536 2018-08-09 00:33:29 The old “I care so much about curing MS I had to dump my stocks in the company before word of the clinical drug trial failures become public knowledge” defense. Classic!
2537 2018-08-09 00:32:56 I can hear it now. "Monooooo, RJ has 4 stocks."

2539 2018-08-09 00:32:07 Right. Highly inadvisable for any member of Congress to actively trade stocks. Index funds, blind trust etc is way to go. But that's not the lesson of the Chris Collins story. That lesson of the Chris Collins story is don't flagrantly commit felonies by textbook insider trading.
2540 2018-08-09 00:29:09 Congressmen, Presidents, cabinet members should be required by law to divest themselves of stocks & business interests when they take office. Srsly.

2542 2018-08-09 00:27:48 I don't care if people own gold or not. Most obviously don't understand gold (in America). I just think those 2 charts are remarkable considering the lofty levels of stocks. Many people act as if gold has dropped 99% or something.

2546 2018-08-09 00:25:04 I smell a straw man purchase.  Since he couldn’t dump his stocks since he was on the board, he probably purchased shares for his family that he could manipulate at will. Not very nice!

2550 2018-08-09 00:23:29 Chris Collins is a total piece of shit. Investing in blue chip pharma stocks doesn't make him some crusader for HIV and MS. What makes rich people think that their gambling habits qualify as altruism?

The advantage is less pronounced trading stocks. Knowing what the trends are in tech could be one but it is not reliable.

2563 2018-08-09 00:17:02 Chris Collins touting himself as a philanthropic savior for those suffering from M.S. is rich.
Looks like he was "suffering" on the video of himself at the White House picnic trying to reach his son on the cellphone , frantic to quickly sell their stocks!!
2564 2018-08-09 00:16:59 Pick two and have Them both up the whole day. Only watch those two. Once you master than then move on up to 3, 4, etc. Otherwise your just wasting time giving a lot of stocks a little attention each and missing plays. Just my opinion.

2568 2018-08-09 00:15:20 Yyeess. . . . . we weren't discussing the difference between bonds (loans) and preferred stocks (ownership).  We were discussing how your owners feed you peanuts and laugh as you brag to others about it on twitter.

2574 2018-08-09 00:13:13 So, Collins decided to make his getting busted for insider trading into an infomercial for a drug company. What an asshole. His other work wasn't in question. Just the fact he was illegally tipping friends & family so they could dump stocks before stocks plummeted. Just resign.

2576 2018-08-09 00:12:50 2) When you read ALL the things you can get away in Congress (trading stocks on inside info was NOT disallowed until Obama Admin.), no wonder people spend so much $$ to get their foot in that golden goose door.
2577 2018-08-09 00:12:44 if we had more consistency and it was common to die at 80% we'd just have more stocks and it wouldn't be weird.

2581 2018-08-09 00:11:54 So, because you wished that the MS drug worked, it's OK to ignore the fact that you and your family dumped stocks? Is that basically your argument? Even if you did some "good things" in your life too...avg "Joes" are fed up with you rich guys thinking you can get away with it!
2582 2018-08-09 00:11:48 Matt, I really think you're not understanding how investing in mutual funds works. You only 'lose everything' if it was all invested in a company that went out of business. When you save for retirement you save with a collection of stocks rather than one
2583 2018-08-09 00:11:46 Hold strong stocks and tune out noise. Had great last three days so far. Can turn other way anytime that is why we have stops.
2584 2018-08-09 00:11:21 Church is a terrible investment. Why won’t folks look into trading stocks? At least there’s *some* chance of return there
2585 2018-08-09 00:10:32 Good grief. Is this Collins just an outright liar? Said he held onto his shares and didn’t sell them. I heard earlier that by the time he found out the drug trial failed, the company stocks he owned, which were appaprently mostly in Australia, were frozen. He couldn’t sell them.
2586 2018-08-09 00:10:14 TIP - U.S. small-cap stocks surged this year, + new highs June 2018. The benchmark S&P Small Cap 600 Index gained around 11% in 2018, out-performing the large cap S&P 500 by more than 5% during this period. 

History shows Small Caps rise rapidly in the fourth Bull Market leg.

2589 2018-08-09 00:10:10 Yeah. Color me skeptical but I’m not buying Chris Collins’ explanation that he was trading in penny stocks because he wanted to better the world.
2590 2018-08-09 00:08:47 They're paying him with 30 million stocks
2591 2018-08-09 00:07:43 Your calls to your son are recorded.  Your son and realtives dumped stocks. Is this how a modern day millionaire makes his money? Scumbag. How many other investors lost their shirts because of your actions?
2592 2018-08-09 00:07:22 @chrislhayes are those stocks sales null and void by the way or those people just ripped off by these insiders?

2594 2018-08-09 00:06:47 Hey TRUMP !!!   Did you sell those stocks Chris Collins told you about?
2595 2018-08-09 00:06:41 People want to use the forward when the narrative is stocks are cheap and the Schiller to say they are expensive......
2596 2018-08-09 00:06:17 So... Collins is just going to roll with he's not guilty of insider trading because he didn't sell his personal stocks... even though his son, son's gf, and multiple extended family members dumped something like 90% of total stock after Collins called his son. Good luck!
2597 2018-08-09 00:06:09 I am as well Brian, I think we need to tighten up the background checks, get rid of bump stocks, and high cap mags.  My mind is still open about military style weapons,  I know the purpose they were designed for, I see no use for them in a civilian world.
2598 2018-08-09 00:04:40 Fact check: Chris Collins said that he did not sell his stocks and lost millions.
Full truth: He couldn’t have sold his stocks if he wanted to. Australia, where his stocks were held, had put a halt on all transactions regarding the company’s stock.
#ChrisCollinsArrested
2599 2018-08-09 00:04:19 As someone who was dxd with  MS at 30, I agree with #ChrisCollins that MS is a devastating disease.

Which is why this press briefing is so infuriating, as he uses people with MS to excuse  his manipulation of stocks for an MS drug. Greed. Corruption.

Deplorable.
#CripTheVote
2600 2018-08-09 00:04:15 I'm confused, I thought we were told today by law enforcement that Collins sold his stocks but Collins just said he didn't and lost millions, now of course I believe  law enforcement but please tell me this guy didn't just lie to your faces.
2601 2018-08-09 00:04:03 Let's have some fun; shall we? Which stocks are you bag holding for the longest?
2602 2018-08-09 00:03:49 You are Dumb as Trump, when a company goes “public” all it means is that PRIVATE citizens can buy stocks. Still a PRIVATE COMPANY with rules and they can ban whoever they want. Twitter is another story, they still permit hate speech and ignorance to write here.
2603 2018-08-09 00:03:16 Wow. Just when I thought this Chris Collins was mostly a low-down, stockholder-robbing, weasel he goes lower. And so does my distain.
Stands there and touts his *accomplishments* so much like Trump.
Says he "held on to his stocks".
 The truth:
He WASN'T ALLOWED TO SELL THEM.
2604 2018-08-09 00:03:07 @msnbc #CryMeARiverChris, is explaining what a great guy he is, & even brought the wife.

2605 2018-08-09 00:02:52 Chris Collins inside trades pharma stocks but he really wants us to know his only concern is Multiple sclerosis
2606 2018-08-09 00:02:46 He forgot to mention that he called his son to dump the stocks. Ooopsies!
2607 2018-08-09 00:02:34 Did that with some oil stocks.
2608 2018-08-09 00:02:29 Collins did not once mention selling his stock or telling others to sell their stocks.
2609 2018-08-09 00:01:58 #hardball #inners At no point in @RepChrisCollins statement does he deny telling his son & family associates to sell stocks based on his insider knowledge.
2610 2018-08-09 00:00:35 GOP Rep Chris Collins is painting himself as a hero when after finding the drug he was highly invested in was proven faulty enough for him to be arrested today because he did inside trading by telling his family to divest of their stocks before the news was out that it failed.
