40 2018-07-22 23:35:01 Record stocks? Umm our 401k has lost more in the last six months than it did the entire 8 years of the Obama presidency. You are wrong.
41 2018-07-22 23:32:26 What would that be, MADAME IMBECILE!? BETTER ECONOMY, better job market for all, stocks up, enthusiasm up, taxes down, etc etc!  The wall is going up, MSM RATINGS GOING  DOWN!!  BE HAPPY! Keep your B/P Down!
42 2018-07-22 23:31:51  She's just jealous. Remember her big dumb red reset button? The most embarrassing thing I ever witnessed. She wanted to make friends with Russia so bad. Even gave them 20 percent of our Uranium stocks.  Sad
43 2018-07-22 23:31:39 With China stocks... 

It's literally a coin toss... either up 20% or down 20%. 

You get what you for in this arena!

45 2018-07-22 23:24:39 Hong Kong stocks could rise 20% from now until the end of the year. Volatility is a two edged sword.
46 2018-07-22 23:22:35 Its was one of the 4 stocks I put on the watchlist before everything went down if it can reach and hold 27 it's a good long if it rejects it will be a great short the other area is a dip buy only if it dropped to 25.13 and held there those r my key levels
47 2018-07-22 23:20:17 When companies have more money they invest more in new jobs. Plus when they make more profits then stocks and 401K’s rise which increases retirement income. Best way to grow wages is for job demand to be greater than worker supply (which it now is for first time in decades).

57 2018-07-22 23:01:20 Greg. This week is a big week for earnings. Tech stocks are reporting and GDP report out on 25th which could point to a high of 5%, which is prob the peak. If it’s a bullish reaction markets may not pullback. Thoughts?

62 2018-07-22 22:57:31 Ok...  I'd love to see them turn on Putin but, frankly, I'm not sure they would even if they wanted to.

Putin controls Russia's stocks of polonium and novichok.

He crosses his t's and dots his i's.

He'd kill em all and seize their fortunes.

74 2018-07-22 22:42:26 I used to work at an Amazon warehouse. They gave everyone free college after a year and company stocks worth like $5,000. The part that's crazy was how many people wouldn't take advantage (free classes) and just stayed in their entry level positions for years and years.

82 2018-07-22 22:38:43 Doesn't bother me at all. We have always had stocks of crude oil and products squirrelled away. Other commodities too, probably. I'd expect no less. Oh, and the EU sponsors the Intervention Board which stores grain etc, but that's OK of course.
83 2018-07-22 22:38:16 1.2% of all Pennsylvanians got a tax cut . Over 6 million didn’t. But you know who did? Corporations and the wealthy. And the corporations are buying back stocks instead of giving bonuses or raises.

111 2018-07-22 22:04:38 @VP is touting the very, very small percentage of American workers that got a pay raise (or worse, a one time bonus) from the #TaxScam . What he's leaving out is that every single Republican run company bought back stocks and only Dem/Independent companies gave a damn.
112 2018-07-22 22:02:10 I think there is actually a lot of truth to that and the interesting question is why is this demand not already satisfied by traditional penny stocks? A: because of heightened regulation since 2000 startups just stay private, which means public misses out on growth.

124 2018-07-22 21:45:32 Appreciate all have different catalysts interested in the sentiment on these stocks. If you want a quick gain buy the high percentage stocks if you are looking longer term them there appears to be some bottom fishing to be done.
125 2018-07-22 21:45:03 I still have not seen spartan stocks, or pony stock qualifications, so I apologize for not posting them. I will keep you up to date on the races though. Here we go folks, cars have been called to the ready chute.
126 2018-07-22 21:40:17 Out of interest which one of these stocks do you think will have the highest percentage gains in the next 6 months.

130 2018-07-22 21:33:07 Not really, bump stocks are a real thing.

But here's the kicker. Our military is trained in single fire (unless you are specifically trained wth LMG/HMG types).

Automatic fire, or even emulated automatic fire is so incredibly ineffective at killing people, we don't use it.

132 2018-07-22 21:29:58 I´m in no position at all but I will never get how some bullish alt charts can dump in seconds just because $BTC dumps. I hate that correlation that´s why I will move more to forex and stocks and stick to $BTC in crypto.
133 2018-07-22 21:29:49 What? No 401k, stocks, tax break?
I'm getting fed up with you, crybaby.
134 2018-07-22 21:27:37 This was literally the worst opinion piece I have ever read.   It sounded like something you would write if you were stoned off your gourd and owned stocks in Amazon.
135 2018-07-22 21:27:21 As reported on @KNX1070 someone is re-seeding abalone stocks off coastal #OrangeCountyCA ? Problem is the inshore #SoCal waters are too polluted for abalone to survive ... Anyone have any thoughts? #fisheries
136 2018-07-22 21:26:34 Good question. This chart represents the return of various investments over the past 20 years. Risky investments like Stocks and Real Estate at 7.7 to 9.7% per year and safe investments like bonds returned 5.3%. There is no guarantee around these investment returns in the future.

145 2018-07-22 21:16:59 So your saying Thames is the difference maker? Why can’t anyone in this market say it.....Braun is done and should be relegated to a PH role. Phillips is the better OF option over Broxton and Braun. No reason for Aguilar to be out. He sat all of April!
146 2018-07-22 21:15:19 Is that you libeling JRM David or it's just that you have no idea about stocks shares and trading in same?
147 2018-07-22 21:13:38 @joerogan "Mark Cuban: 'Huge, huge' losses for stocks if Trump wins" 2016. Think of all the people that this effected because he wanted Clinton to win, not based on any market analysis. Now @PeterSchiff is predicting a recession based on "we are over due". That's it?!
148 2018-07-22 21:13:29 That institutional approach to investing winning out next 3-5-10 years. No more QE, less correlation among #stocks . So many have piled into passive. How can something that everybody is doing turn out well?  That doesn't happen in investing. Perhaps over short term, but not long!

150 2018-07-22 21:07:45 investor can't predict direction of the stock market, but harder to predict direction of curreny market. Yet, currency market influences stocks (e.g. dollar up,gold and EM stocks down).Multi strategy investing is way to go in late innings. #stocks #gold #privatedebt #RE

172 2018-07-22 20:40:50 it's a sunday lineup..but yes..he needs to improve  certain spots. catcher and 2b for starters.

183 2018-07-22 20:24:07 @espnhomer if you’re guy is so smart.....why does he have 5 guys in the lineup under .710 in OPS? Oh and I didn’t include the P spot
184 2018-07-22 20:24:04 Hopefully all the worst in markets is behind us. Let’s have a better week in stocks from this week. This week should probably see oil dropping 6-8 dollars. Let’s hope for the best. #nifty50 #hdfcbank

188 2018-07-22 20:21:10 Impatient sellers (or forced sellers) in illiquid markets are sweet words in other markets too -- microcap stocks for me. Things change over time and the same assets have buyers.

190 2018-07-22 20:20:00 I bet you were fine with the tax cut they just gave billionaires and millionaires? They promised to put that towards jobs but most only ended up buying back their own stocks to artificially inflate the price. 

Just save the moral outrage for something believable.
191 2018-07-22 20:15:44 That's not exactly how it works. Already there are issues BEFORE we leave the EU. Stocks can only be ordered 5 working days in advance - I recently had to go to the sick kids hospital for supplies as they were delayed in transit. This is a common occurrence that will get WORSE.
192 2018-07-22 20:14:29 Curious to know if this will allow more corporate arm twisting by such activist groups as the NAACP, Mentioned in the article? @SundayFutures when political investments into corporations/stocks is a thing then you know the government controls too much.
193 2018-07-22 20:14:07 That's because banks weren't lending money. They were putting into stocks instead. The stock market has never been a good indicator of the overall economy in the era of the Federal Reserve.
194 2018-07-22 20:13:52 Good answer. That’s kind of how I view it. Just trying to think what would happen in the mean time. where would all the stocks live.

263 2018-07-22 19:08:49 Smallcaps and midcaps have turned into the state of unjustifiable pessimism as per my understanding ( very little experience ). Intelligent Investor buys from the pessimist. So if you feel stocks are available at cheap price , buy them instead of timing the market.

267 2018-07-22 19:03:34 I don't know who own those stocks or profits from them.

Medicine is my business partners sector.

I used to be really pro pure state NHS, then I saw what some other countries have, other systems can actually work better. Open to abuse though, regulators need to be top rate.

Not even counting the skim he’s making off tariffs, tax loopholes for companies and shorting stocks on companies he dislikes. Its a limitless flow of money into his and his friends pockets.

281 2018-07-22 18:55:27 Remember when Donald Trump lied about that and said he wasn't a part of approving the deal that gave the Russians control of 1/5 of our uranium stocks, but then his emails were leaked showing he did lie about it?

296 2018-07-22 18:36:53 Dow is up 1.4% YTD. Wonder where it would be without stock repurchases from corporate tax cuts in #TaxScamBill? Stocks rose after election in anticipation of tax cut: Trump has nothing more to offer. Be careful with your 401(k), if you have one.
297 2018-07-22 18:36:39 Small account size might be a problem.  Can't recall though I think if you do all electronic notifications there is no charge. FYI Vanguard is slashing commissions on virtually all ETFs to $0.  It'll still cost something to trade stocks though.

299 2018-07-22 18:35:38 What @RealAlexJones is trying to say is that none of these platforms (youtube/facebook/twitter etc) are accountable. Since their stocks are largely subsidized by a rigged stock market, they aren't even accountable to their shareholders.

309 2018-07-22 18:24:38 I think the "my properties are my pension" thing simply boils down to a leveraged bet on capital appreciation, e.g. put 10% down, the bank puts 90% down, benefit from 100% of future equity - unlike stocks which are not leveraged.  I still prefer the flexibility of stocks though!

313 2018-07-22 18:17:05 What's wrong with the word stocks?  Only in the past 20 years have people said equities more often.  You can have equity in real estate too so it's not as precise a word as stocks.

346 2018-07-22 17:50:49 Value holds up better than growth in earlier stages of a bear market. Although value won’t escape a severe bear market unscathed, it’s a historical fact that momentum stocks, which typically lead prior to market peaks, will be among the first & hardest hit when the music stops.
347 2018-07-22 17:49:02 Trucks are not meant to kill. Neither are airplanes (see, generally, 9/11). However, that is the primary purpose of guns. More automation, bump stocks, silencers, armor-piercing bullets, etc., are all primarily meant to make it easier to kill more people more efficiently.
348 2018-07-22 17:47:26 That seems to be what Trump is saying here. That we can “afford” to go down on Stocks a little in the service of this greater good. Because the stock numbers are higher than anticipated, supposedly.

400 2018-07-22 16:51:02 I think this book I’m reading is the longest book I’ve ever read and most of it is about old politicians arguing about stocks and bonds through letters and public accounts. Somehow I like it though
401 2018-07-22 16:50:22 @MPelletierCIO  Yup, and it has pretty much been like that for the last 10 years. Stocks have also been "overvalued" for 8 years. So many ppl missed out on the bull run.  Before FANG there were the Horseman. Mkt always has concentrated leaders.
402 2018-07-22 16:49:38 As a result of not needing spend $ on bands like ABBA, enough people invest in stocks that they can afford Greek Islands, or expensive sailboats. Hence, trying to figure out who your dad is at the wedding is the most important issue of this world...

1. You can’t trade blue chip stocks with small acct. just pennystocks

Time to wake up people.
406 2018-07-22 16:45:00 I talk to “populist” Trump supporters in my family. Literally belief their job would already be outsourced but for Trump and stocks now the populist way to track the economy.

Also 3% quarters and 200k job growth hadn’t occurred in a decade, would be 0 for both if Hillary won.
407 2018-07-22 16:44:02 In terms of % increase I think infa will be one of the best stocks over next 12 months. Easily justifies an mcap 3-4 x this for where they are now. When non dilutive finance is concluded maybe 10-20 x this imo

In my opinion, the 2Q report for these companies could be the big catalyst for the change in sentiment. When people realize the attractive value that these names are offering.
415 2018-07-22 16:34:53 @realDonaldTrump What if I don't own stocks? What if cost of health insurance has doubled? What if gas & groceries go up? YOU'RE PLAYING WITH MY MONEY.
416 2018-07-22 16:34:09 I don't  disagree. Yes average people have savings that are at risk.
My main point is Trump's Playing with bank money comment is more likely to wipe out the average person compared to wealthy who own bulk of stocks.
Rich might have to sell 2nd home, normals lose their only home.

419 2018-07-22 16:26:36 I wrote about b in a different strain of this tweet thread. For stocks to be less risky in the long run requires mean reversion in long-run equity returns. This is very hard to test and the evidence is, at best, mixed

Hard for some to realize that you can be wrong 50%+ of the time and still make a fortune. Majority of gains come from a minority of stocks.

Unequivocally yes they are worth it.
425 2018-07-22 16:21:41 Maybe we would win such a war.  But there was never any reason to incite one in the first place.  This is about manipulation of stocks and his friends making money

All stocks have plateaus. dives, and a limited cap that is created by the company's peak levels of performance.

Expansion can only go so far.

Who will buy a peaked stock anyways? Cant cash out

476 2018-07-22 15:28:53 Candlesticks patterns/analysis is more indicative in #crypto and #fx than stocks. In general, the bigger the time frame and higher the volume, the more indicative the candlestick would be. It is not a signal by itself though. Never take decisions based on candlesticks alone.

515 2018-07-22 14:53:59 Goldman said at end June that 100% of ytd S&P500 returns were due to 10 stocks many of those 10 stocks were tech names
516 2018-07-22 14:51:21 Who? Who has it helped? do you even understand the debt we are being left with..they have already admit the taxes cuts are nut generating the revenue needed bc companies are buying their stocks back that’s why the market is so high. But it doesn’t help us In the long run
517 2018-07-22 14:48:46 @JohnCornyn As my senator, I expect you to comment about this. It’s not “the bank’s” money, it’s my retirement investments. Should I be cashing my IRA stocks now before the market tanks again? 78240
518 2018-07-22 14:48:16 How about you put some pressure on our idiot president before he destroys our economy with his stupid trade war? 

Taking all my $ out of stocks for now. Too much chance they will tank as the Affect of the war is felt.

519 2018-07-22 14:47:21 My company doesn’t do individual stocks right now, but we’re getting back into commodities (oil especially). Hugely unloved sector, significantly cash-generative at current prices, and years of under-investment may well mean supply shortages and soaring prices in near future.

521 2018-07-22 14:44:08 The real travesty is that Bezos pays no federal income tax by writing off tax credits and stocks, and various other writeoffs, all through the provisions of the law.
522 2018-07-22 14:42:58 Haha, not rich by any means, but my dad got lucky with stocks and that really helped. It also helped that we were the first ones to build a house in the area, so we started the neighborhood. There are a few rich families around us though

526 2018-07-22 14:40:08 Hard for some to realize that you can be wrong 50%+ of the time and still make a fortune. Majority of gains come from a minority of stocks.
527 2018-07-22 14:39:26 Its good to know that because as a beginner its easy to be dissapointed when it is just 2-3 stocks that are doing great and the rest are slow or not moving at all but thats literally how a portfolio looks like most of the times?
528 2018-07-22 14:37:12 Bring back the stocks 
529 2018-07-22 14:35:49 It’s best to stick to your 401k and Roth’s especially after 55. Stocks - not for anyone who can’t stand to lose 25k, ever.
530 2018-07-22 14:35:23 Uh, I rent so I can “speculate” in stocks and was very short real estate.  The banks speculated in real estate, fraudulently in many cases. They got it wrong and got bailed out. That’s not capitalism. Banks are now bigger, the scenario/outcome creates a massive moral hazard.
531 2018-07-22 14:34:56 Except the market has been going up & DOWN reacting to his trade war. As  companies start to lose $, stocks will go down, jobs will be lost, retirement savings will go down. He is a giant empty skull occupying sholders wrapped in a cheap Chinese Trump tie.
532 2018-07-22 14:33:37 There is lots of money in uncertainty. Pushing for this will drop the value of stocks and if you have the money, you can win big. Hasn’t everyone watched Casino Royal where the guy tried to blow up an airplane. Brexit is that.

543 2018-07-22 14:20:50 Whatever the right mix of US/non-US stocks going forward, it will almost certainly be preferable to target smaller and more value-oriented stocks within those allocations, not simply default to a market cap weighted policy. That was my only point.
544 2018-07-22 14:20:35 Read my lips. The UK will adopt a fill-your-boots fishing policy with no fishing limits to protect fish-stocks enshrined in law. In a decade or so Britains fishing communities will have been destroyed by greedy uncontrolled overfishing.

586 2018-07-22 13:40:21 The only ones a recession helps are big business/corporations and those with LOTS of disposable income. 
1) Small businesses will fail, opening up more market share to take over.
2) Rich folks will buy stocks as they slump, further consolidating economic power.

592 2018-07-22 13:34:26 Amended investing is the answer.  I don’t see much else helping. 

ASM deals with induced volatility in illiquid stocks. It ain’t going away anywhere. 

A better approach is to pursue quality in very liquid stocks and invest there. Or, to avoid induced volatility in illiquid cos.

643 2018-07-22 12:36:35 I think both equally important. You will find most stocks with large selldowns tend to underperform materially in the 12 months there after.

646 2018-07-22 12:35:59 Market saw market cap erosion Rs. 17 lac crore since Jan 2018 but  headline indexes of NIFTY and SENSEX have not declined much.

652 2018-07-22 12:27:37 Or just become normal as more countries put regulation in place. Several now have regulation and even exchanges allowing ICOs next to real world stocks etc which is already starting to appear.

655 2018-07-22 12:25:30 Sir I really appreciate how you have been honest about your funds recent under performance and taking responsibility. Most of the so called experts don't do that. You stocks might have underperformed but respect for you has outperformed. Thank you

659 2018-07-22 12:20:57 It seems that Victoria's Secret stocks are down
1. You took away the clothes that were online anyway
2. You took away swimwear and coverups 
3. You only offer limited sizes in store
4. How many bras, panties, leggings can one person own
5. The rewards program sucks now

667 2018-07-22 12:06:41 How much of the flows into these passive funds holding the FAANG stocks are on systematic investment plans in 401k’s that will keep buying even during a downturn?  This will act as a buffer to any big drops hopefully!

Any thoughts on yours?
670 2018-07-22 12:04:48 The man who begins to speculate in stocks/crypto with the intention of making a fortune usually goes broke, whereas the man who trades with a view of getting good interest on his money sometimes gets rich.
671 2018-07-22 11:59:38 There is certainly euphoria in FAANGS and a correction is likely coming. However a few stocks explaining most mkt returns is not unprecedented. Check H. Bessembinder’s work for example.
672 2018-07-22 11:53:07 Most aim stocks don’t have fundamentals, it’s all about the story weather it’s BS or not doesn’t really matter as long as it holds up while your in. There are a few obvious frauds that appear and people saying negative comments is probably more useful than staying quiet
673 2018-07-22 11:48:15 You should not touch a stock that stops behaving it's expected to behave. Erratic behaviour stocks are the riskiest plays for traders. They can trap you by being nice (small rallies) and then can show their cruel intentions.
674 2018-07-22 11:47:40 check out @eri_shoppe.. she’s going back to HK to buy albums (she’s watching elyxion dot in macao) i’m not sure if the form’s still open but if it is, she can buy the albums for you if there are available stocks.. 
675 2018-07-22 11:47:35 Or, he’ll just short any stocks potentially affected by this, then buy again at the lows when he reverses policy. It’d be a great time to see his tax returns and a FinCEN analysis of his stock portfolio’s activity over the last 18 months.

678 2018-07-22 11:44:33 RT SJosephBurns "The 200 day SMA is one of the biggest signals in the market telling you which side to be on. Bull above, Bear below. Bad things happen to stocks and markets when this line is lost."
679 2018-07-22 11:41:16 When mi band 3 will launch in india? Or need to do more wait untill mi band 2 stocks get empty.
680 2018-07-22 11:41:00 The 200 day SMA is one of the biggest signals in the market telling you which side to be on. Bull above, Bear below. Bad things happen to stocks and markets when this line is lost.
681 2018-07-22 11:39:31 Too early for that besides trust level is low as of now so even if its included I'm certain only few will even think of buying their stocks and also the issues of certain requirements needed before being listed. The list going on.
682 2018-07-22 11:39:29 United Arab Emirates stocks mixed at close of trade; DFM General down 0.16%
683 2018-07-22 11:39:17 We aren't the 1% by very far, but we invest a little here and there in companies that pay good dividends and always reinvest them. Been doing that for 20 years now. It's not only for the rich, some good stocks are less than $10 a share. Just have to do some research.
684 2018-07-22 11:38:29 Agreed. But not sure US equities boom - higher $ will crush earnings, and the tech leaders (exposed to strong $) are driving this narrow market.

EM crisis would spill back to US stocks too. Ironically, this would do some of the tightening for Fed. 

Could extend US biz cycle?
685 2018-07-22 11:37:58 July has been a great month for tyre stocks.
686 2018-07-22 11:37:58 Lady it is true. Try Google.  He & his kids have admitted it on National Television. Do you follow the stocks/mutual funds etc ? It always go up &  down usually every 5-7 yrs.  
What is absurd is you following a Russian Traitor.  
Please do your research.
687 2018-07-22 11:37:49 There are many other better stocks in the sector.
688 2018-07-22 11:37:47 My dream of your middle class has no influence over production streams. You give me too much credit. A fifth wheel close to an eroding beach is my "middle class" income dream. No power for a teachers pension. I think stocks reach more folks than you think.

707 2018-07-22 11:04:53 Think of it this way. If I borrow $100,000 from my bank, the amount that I ow them does not depend on what I do with the money. Whether I invest in stocks, bonds, or whether I use it all to buy beanie-babies, is totally irrelevant. I still owe them $100k.

Every opportunity should be optimized by investing in sound businesses or multibagger #stocks rather than desisting your investments out of fear. However, one should not buy stocks of weak business which may look attractive.

755 2018-07-22 09:55:48 The market is a pendulum that forever swings between unsustainable
optimism (which makes stocks too expensive) and unjustified
pessimism (which makes them too cheap). The intelligent investor
is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists.

772 2018-07-22 09:28:00 Well, in every objective measurable sense blacks can do anything whites can do, buy property, start businesses, buy and trade, own stocks etc, they even have gotten preferential opportunities and treatment for the last 25 years
773 2018-07-22 09:27:26 Fear? Who mentioned fear? It's simple facts, eg adding customs & regulatory checks to imports & exports increases costs for business. Delays impact JIT meaning larger stocks of parts are needed, more costs. 

In general adding costs without benefits to business isn't ideal.

817 2018-07-22 08:23:53 I think you are wrong in calling them cheats. They promised delivery on or before 26th. There is a high possibility they would have got the stocks on 21st for the phone

821 2018-07-22 08:15:36 Inflation isn't a negative occurrence. Its the first trigger that the economy will grow better than average in last few years. Won't be surprised if GDP's keep rising along with it and stocks markets too!

904 2018-07-22 05:32:31 Is the Summation index or the other oscillators providing you any clues to near term direction?  Don’t have the sense things are overbought - except perhaps FANG stocks (not nflx anymore)....I have seen consolidation in $TWTR and other less favored names.  Biotech, maybe OK?
905 2018-07-22 05:31:49 well managed large cap stocks have consistently outperformed badly managed mid and small caps. hence this large cap = lower performance does not always hold true.

911 2018-07-22 05:24:50 Just took 12 stocks in a 15 stocks crew battle. 
912 2018-07-22 05:22:40 The trick is not to learn to trust your gut feelings, but rather to discipline yourself to ignore them. Stand by your stocks as long as the fundamental story of the company hasn’t changed.

916 2018-07-22 05:21:03 @med_theflow You've got competition when it comes to soloing entire crews with Roy. @CloudySSB just took 12 stocks (out of 15) from the Chile crew. And Chile isn't a weak region by any means, even when missing players.

Why is Roy so good in crews?

Some of the stocks could be in focus for corporate actions such as bonus announcements, stock splits and dividend, among others.

So, the likes of Titan, Thermax, Ramco Cem, Blue Star, Graphite, BASF & Britannia will all be in focus as they declare their dividend
932 2018-07-22 04:54:55 30 #Trading Rules

1. Buying a weak stock is like betting on a slow horse. It is retarded.
2. Stocks are only cheap if they are going higher after you buy them.
3. Never trust a person more than the market. People lie, the market does not.

950 2018-07-22 04:36:13 Slightly disagree ... IMO this fall or meltdown was waiting to happen since the words were turning.... can’t attribute this to ASM only... quality stocks in this category would rise back in due course with or without ASM change.

977 2018-07-22 03:55:00 Enjoyed the latest True Wealth.  I agree with you that we are seeing a similar situation like 1990 with investors piling into tech stocks.  Cautiously watching. 
Thanks for the great work
978 2018-07-22 03:54:38 Yes sir ur right, even if a stock is undervalued and everyone is behind it just because it is undervalued, rest assured it will be undervalued till weeks loose patience and sell the stake, that is the market, its a game of patience,
979 2018-07-22 03:54:30 Great article.

983 2018-07-22 03:49:45 ALDI is very weird, they advertise "Igloos! Limited stocks!" and you find yourself thinking "Why not, it seems cheap for an igloo."
984 2018-07-22 03:47:23 I am definitely learning a lot from these courses! I am taking a paid course next that teaches more in depth about investing in the OTC .00 & .000 stocks! I don't just want to be a day trader. I want to make investments with a strategy.
985 2018-07-22 03:44:59 Don’t think they r really “reaching” out to low income base. If they could clear all inventory at sticker prices each season, they would. But reality is they r stuck with excess stocks and need to discount them without being known as a “discounter” hence outlet stores

990 2018-07-22 03:36:21 Now suppose if we expect a price hike of say 6%, final product cost would be 106rs while customer was earlier paying 112rs, so benefit to customer is =6/112=5%, and if price is increased to 8%, which is more likely than benefit to customer 4/112=just 3.5%,

995 2018-07-22 03:32:57 With Ryan or his likely replacement nothing will happen to punish this sorry lot. One can only dream of the stocks, horsewhipping, or running them out of town on a rail. Oh, wait, that is now called the vote.

1001 2018-07-22 03:22:44 Again know what you are talking about or don’t talk. NRA has been behind the NFA, didn’t help stop the Hughes Amendment, helped write the 1994 “Assault Weapons” Ban and is supportive of regulations on Bump Stocks. NRA has been compromising since the beginning. No more compromise.

1003 2018-07-22 03:20:03 I was stunned when Grover didn't understand how buying back stocks increase share prices which increase the profits by major shareholders and top executives.  Thanks to 1993 Bill Clinton companies pay executives with stock options.  Buying back stocks increase their earnings.
1004 2018-07-22 03:18:41 Gst he has to pay 12-8.4=3.6, now in present scenario, oem has to pay 8.4rs, since he is not getting charging any o/p gst, so that cost increased on final product is 8.4-3.6=4.8, 4.8/70=6.8%, so we can expect 6-8% price hike,
1005 2018-07-22 03:18:17 They said in the DC V. Heller case that we have an individual right to bear arms with restrictions. I view banning bump stocks as an acceptable restriction.
1006 2018-07-22 03:16:09 I want businesses and stocks and investments and properties and land, shit to leave my kids so I know that they’re good when I’m gone.

1011 2018-07-22 03:11:03 Print , ie. demand data points. China has been importing less already. Some say they are drawing stocks, could be due to demand softening
1012 2018-07-22 03:10:58 Sir let me explain you with one example suppose final product cost is 70rs oem paid 8.4rs gst on raw material @12%, now if oem sells the product at 100rs adding 30% margin, he will charge 12rs gst @12%, now oem will get gst refund of 8.4rs, which he already paid,
1013 2018-07-22 03:10:07 Stop trying to tank Musk and Tesla. Pushing this negative line to tank their stocks so people that have been shorting their Tesla stock for years can be saved from massive losses by Tesla’s success is detrimental to innovation. The status quo needs to change.

1026 2018-07-22 02:52:47 Most of the national debt financed tax cut has poured into stock buybacks which has... kept stocks flat for the year. Buoying the market on a tax payer leverage is playing with, I think Paul Ryan might have once said, future generations' money.

1038 2018-07-22 02:37:10 MAJOR REASON to consider buying rentals is to make use of leveraged returns but if you are buying $30-50k dogshit houses that never go up in value, how can u capitalize on leverage?

YOU CAN'T!

So why bother? High risk zero reward! Stick to PASSIVE divy stocks/REITs instead!

1042 2018-07-22 02:23:20 So, when it is said that historically stocks return about 8-10% per year....which time frame are we talking about? And now we are starting with under a 3% dividend yield. Good luck going forward if you expect a good return on stocks!

So, essentially, the only Boomers who hold any significant amount of stocks are multi-millionaires.

1079 2018-07-22 01:39:49 Considering that $DJI drops underperforming stocks and picks up new ones, I always wondered how fair is it to compare the now with the then, or to $BTC as some do.
1080 2018-07-22 01:38:16 As general mass is behind these stocks means would not perform at least next 6 months ..
1081 2018-07-22 01:34:57 There are a lot of things people can do in Photoshop to make their designs 100% their own however a lot of people in the community use stocks including myself.
I have nothing against anyone doing it all by using Photoshop’s features or using Google/Adobe Stock for help
1082 2018-07-22 01:34:53 Can you tell me, On what basis did you classify the stocks as bullish Vs bearish ?
1083 2018-07-22 01:33:39 Impacts to asset values via economic impacts through equities (stocks) open the hatch of concern. It's not wages that produce the income inequality that exists, it's asset values. And asset values via stocks (and stock options) are at the center of the issue. Absent that, bupkis.
1084 2018-07-22 01:31:29 They bump-stocks.
1085 2018-07-22 01:30:23 nothing is impossible when your business “subscribers “ paid for the 200K car and then some. Just don’t sell dreams to hard working people that Penny stocks will get the lifestyle like you have, because it’s not the case. How much is did you earn from trading PS so far? 100K?
1086 2018-07-22 01:28:18 Wha wha what?  Does he not own stocks?

1088 2018-07-22 01:26:09 How are your stocks doing? Your 401K? Getting more in your paycheck? Oh, did you know this is the 1st year that NoKo is not having their hate USA parade? Oh, and Trump has women, blacks, and gays in high political positions. Wow! Jobs, jobs and more jobs! Everybody is working!
1089 2018-07-22 01:25:57 Stocks that kind of meat.”
1090 2018-07-22 01:23:56 Well damn, any of us who owned stocks lived through it and know first hand. It's absurd that Trump thinks he can spin that. Then again, I guess most of his base didn't and don't own stocks.
1091 2018-07-22 01:23:33 You could still shoot people from a 30 story building without bump stocks. Knife them? Yeah not so much.

1106 2018-07-22 01:08:44 @bullpennant I have to agree with you.  I’m retail as I took the IPO at 20c. After the stock split I’m still up 3/4 times. @stockswami appreciate you looking out for retail but look back at any stocks broker fees / ops after the stock has done well and it looks the same as here.
1107 2018-07-22 01:08:06 Yeah all the time. I don't really use Robinhood's graphs because it doesn't show a whole lot of info. So I use other apps and websites.

1119 2018-07-22 00:49:20 Nope, but watch it happen.  All of the bubbles will be bursted, and the world as we know it will end.  Debt, derivatives, housing, stocks/bonds, pension plans, retirement savings, monetary velocity.  Credit itself will no longer exist.  The world has never seen what is coming.

1124 2018-07-22 00:40:27 This sounds good, except recent reports show wages are going down, companies are buying back stocks instead of raising wages. So it would appear, the top 1% benefited, while majority did not. Income disparity is growing. You need the middle class to buy goods & services.

1169 2018-07-21 23:59:35 You are right.. this more applicable when the stock is trading at strike price say 240 or 370 etc but less applicable when stocks trade at 275, 375 etc..

1211 2018-07-21 22:55:48 The companies didn't hire more people or raise wages.

They mainly spend the tax cuts on buying back their stocks, upping the dividend to their owners and if anybody got a raise it was probably for the CEO.
1212 2018-07-21 22:54:27 On the other hand, if you’ve international investments as recommended by John Redwood and perhaps some in the FTSE as the £ drops the value of stocks can rise.

It all depends on luck, how your pension works etc, or rent out your UK home and rent something better in Spain.

1226 2018-07-21 22:36:43 Tip - A  key to an edge is tracking insiders activity. At times I look for stocks there, find one, then research why their buying. If I can get it at a lower price (chart it) than multiple insiders it’s good. If some Insiders buy big buys its also good. Websites tomorrow.

1242 2018-07-21 22:13:39 I want to diversify into assets that do well when the US economy tanks and drags down the rest of the world like us in Europe. After making 20% gains on US stocks and 15% loss on the euro/ dollar exchange rate I knew something was fishy and i never stopped researching ever since.

68% of Nasdaq 100 and 62% of S&P 500 stocks above the 200 dma. Flat.
1244 2018-07-21 22:12:28 My two cents, is the lack of real (inflation-adjusted) wage growth. People have jobs but aren’t getting much wealthier, and rich people who own stocks have become much better off, relatively. Labor as share of national income is at all-time low. This is a major problem.

1300 2018-07-21 20:41:27 #IPO: Five issues came public Thursday/Friday, all in the healthcare sector, four of the five in the biotech group, and all five scoring gains of near 50% or more in opening 1-2 days. This says something about the speculative sentiment #stocks
1301 2018-07-21 20:40:52 Btw, by crashing stock market w/ bailout funds going there, after margin calls & lost stocks/values the bailout recipients were able to ride up tax $s paid for stock market thereby gutting more American wealth & transferring>| Loans for "sm biz" were stalled/never materialized.

1314 2018-07-21 20:09:10 Since 1926, if the real return on bonds is positive, stocks have had a -13% correlation. If the real return on bonds is negative, stocks have had a 44% correlation. Over the whole period, the average correlation has been 10%.  Simple assumptions are dangerous.

1319 2018-07-21 20:04:48 If Gold falls, which it probably will, it will likely squeeze most people out before it takes off. That is the purpose of manupulation, just as we saw repeatedly in 2008. The deflationary drop on stocks will be the excuse. When most are squeezed out, up it goes imho.
1320 2018-07-21 20:03:58 "In that case, you thought wrong. Interestingly, there were 29 stocks within the S&P 500 that traded above ten times revenues at the peak of the dotcom mania (though that number did surge higher after prices had already peaked). Today, there are 28."

1323 2018-07-21 20:02:56 You think all of the sheep the climb the slope to the cliff edge in stocks and then fall to the rocks below expect QE immediately thereafter? I don't. Bullion Banks drove Gold down in 2008. Could do so again. Squeeze everyone out before the massive rally that follows.

There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.
私たちの株式投資への意欲をそぐような要因がかなりある。
1340 2018-07-21 19:40:51 Boomers could offset losses prior, because they were adding to retirement accounts and buying more shares low.  The next bear market when this large cohort is taking withdrawals and not contributing, will shift perspective re risk and allocation to stocks in retirement IMHO
1341 2018-07-21 19:39:31 Dollar strength will continue to put pressure on earnings and stocks with large international exposure. Maybe why Trump has brought it up recently, not to mention more trade worries
1342 2018-07-21 19:39:14 Yep, I go through the selection process for the stocks I put on watch every Sunday morning in the session.
1343 2018-07-21 19:38:57 There are stocks for this: they are called shitcoins
1344 2018-07-21 19:37:10 Big earnings week for me. $MA, $AMZN, $V, $BA. Had a good earnings week last week with $UNH and $CE. Hoping for another good week this week. #stocks #stockstowatch
1345 2018-07-21 19:37:08 Uh, no, most conservatives were totally fine with the idea of banning bump stocks. Have you ever even conversed with one in person, or do you just rely on the propaganda and Twitter?
1346 2018-07-21 19:36:43 How this for a pitch? "It's like Uber, but you pay someone who lives nearby to punch that dickhead in his preferred stocks."
1347 2018-07-21 19:36:04 Everything trump does he does to devalue either stocks or commodities so his sycophants can swoop in and take them over. Mnuchin was the worst for foreclosures and he’s been in trumps ear for a while. Remember Republicans didn’t want the auto industry bailed out...
1348 2018-07-21 19:35:29 If you are even slightly off in terms of the stock selection, markets have become quite unforgiving.
Metal stocks under pressure perpetually- due to the fear of extra debt coming in anytime (even with related acquisitions for scale-up)

@RichifyMeClub - your thoughts please?
1349 2018-07-21 19:35:12 Did you go for individual stocks or indexes?
1350 2018-07-21 19:34:02 Before trading crypto I used robinhood to trade stocks. I failed. It was hard to even make 20 bucks lol. I bought Litecoin yesterday and I'm already up 20$ with less than half my investment in stocks was last year.  Granted I've learned a few tricks since then, but still.
1351 2018-07-21 19:32:59 Already got investments in stocks now time to get in on some Realestate
1352 2018-07-21 19:29:23 Printing more money is a simple tool which makes salaries to devalue and stocks to grow increasing income inequality between shareholders and their slaves.
1353 2018-07-21 19:29:21 have a Question, understand you expecting a lower low in gold when stocks crash in the coming months.  but if the market is meant to take as much money from pplz as possible, would it allow pplz to load up gold at such low price when everyone knows Fed revert to QE at that time

1355 2018-07-21 19:27:06 #BearPrediction
When all stocks start falling down together, it means one is entering into bears, primary indication of bear market. The overall trend in market/sector does matters, remaining cautious and ego-less is always important in any kind of market. Ego and emotion hurts!!
1356 2018-07-21 19:26:14 How do you define “Best growth stocks”?
1357 2018-07-21 19:25:21 you're not confused.  Obama made stockmarkets money.  How many citizens do you know own stocks?  Because people work 9-5 does not mean they don't work hard.  That's an ignorant assumption.
1358 2018-07-21 19:25:03 Conservatives collectively lose their minds if you so much as suggest banning bump stocks, so I don't even need to overreach with "overturning the second amendment" to make my point.  You're just trying to push things in a direction that is easier for you to argue.
1359 2018-07-21 19:23:36 Makes me wish I had time to learn more about stocks and investing 
1360 2018-07-21 19:23:01 I wish Hold ratings were more common and positive. Holding a stock is usually good. I own a handful of stocks that I’m going to keep holding.
1361 2018-07-21 19:19:26 @RepTomReed another sock puppet took NRA cash.  We are going to need more barrels.  If I were into stocks, I'd recommend buying barrels stock. Lots and lots of barrels.
1362 2018-07-21 19:17:37 Yeah I can’t think of very many times where my best performing stocks ever seemed cheap. I credit @themotleyfool for education on long term holding best quality companies.
1363 2018-07-21 19:17:36 Both their stocks dropped nobody really wudda filled up the venue to see em,it's an ait battle but not like we were really anticipating it..shits like Shawn Michaels vs Undertaker,it'll be cool to watch but no one really wanna see it

1365 2018-07-21 19:12:10 Sounds like great advice. Except for the part where 401K assests are tied up in stocks and bonds themselves.

1367 2018-07-21 19:11:31 It's true the market began to climb out of the celler in 2008, but stocks took off like a rocket after Trump was elected (S&P up 31%!). In any case, the economy under Obama was far from perfect. GDP growth, for example, didn't average 2% during his tenure and wages were sluggish.

1370 2018-07-21 19:11:04 Yes, he did. He had the military de-escalate with Assad, even after he used chemical weapons on civilians again, negotiating with Russia to have the rest of the stocks dismantled (unsuccessfully). It was the most far left decision in the history of the American Presidency
1371 2018-07-21 19:08:13 It's been fantastic. I completely left Scottrade (Now TDAmeritrade) for it. Being able to trade without the fees is so much better. They also filter out a bunch of the scammy penny stocks but you can still buy smaller value stocks. Pretty good this far

1379 2018-07-21 18:52:18 Stocks paused this week but the intermediate term looks fine.  We may rally on GOOG, FB orAMZN earnings but there may be a "sell the news" trade shortly after said rally into month end rebalance and Quant tightening on 7/31.
1380 2018-07-21 18:47:25 Bring back the stocks....
1381 2018-07-21 18:46:21 Yes, and printing money for a few (like QE:s have done) also increases #inflation, only on assets they then buy such as #stocks, #bonds, #RealEstate in cities.
1382 2018-07-21 18:46:13 The establishment? So he stocks his cabinet with no experienced billionaires. I mean, who wouldn’t want a third rate shoe designer as a top advisor. Or a real estate salesman to “broker” peace in the Middle East or an education secretary who was never in a public school.

1387 2018-07-21 18:39:42 LMAO... Stock market lol. Trump's tax cuts for the 1% allows corporations to buy back stocks. The richest 10% of Americans own 84% of stocks. This means nothing to average working people. GDP was at 2 and is still at 2. Average wages down 1.4%, inflation up 6%. #BOTLIES

1403 2018-07-21 18:27:30 Disappointed with my online shop today with @Morrisons - so many out of stocks, hoping not many substitutes tomorrow when its delivered! Also, is there a reason @Morrisons certain in store bakery items (pastries, doughnuts) aren’t available online?
1404 2018-07-21 18:26:12 One thing to be wary of is that Robin Hood is a little funky in how it does trades. You probably know all this but if you don't look in to how they're executed, more volatile stocks scare me on it.
1405 2018-07-21 18:23:24 Samesies. I did get a RT yesterday saying that BL typically stocks their store earlyearlyearly in the AM.
1406 2018-07-21 18:18:08 It's simple. Don't buy stocks... buy companies.

1409 2018-07-21 18:11:09 Allegra made Batnick omit those middle 200 stocks.
1410 2018-07-21 18:11:06 Terrible idea. Don't invest in stocks. Invest in gold. 
Stocks are pretty hard to predict but gold's value is ever climbing, and it practically adjusts itself for inflation. You'll probably make money.

1412 2018-07-21 18:10:42 I do to... But I have lost about maybe a dollar or too. I agree that it is a great way to invest and not be too involved. I mean of course it's risky but it's also your own self taking care of your own money. What stocks do you have currently? I got my eye on @AMD right now.
1413 2018-07-21 18:09:14 You do know that shit happens in real life also.. In stocks?  Team coins are locked by the way.
1414 2018-07-21 18:09:07 There is truth in both things you’ve said. Distribution-wise BTC and other crypto look horrendous (Gini coefficient on any looks barbaric, but look at stocks). My main argument was liquidity expansion. There is a naivety out there that’s it’s nothing
1415 2018-07-21 18:07:28 He hasn’t donated for a while & has moved house so can’t find his old paperwork - he knows his blood type though & considering low stocks this should be enough surely?
1416 2018-07-21 18:06:28 Reading news about your stock will eventually trigger you make a mistake. Don't do it. You will never become the investor you deserve to be. You may buy all the right stocks, but when times get tough the news overtakes your judgement. Remember the research/reason you bought in.
1417 2018-07-21 18:06:27 LOL. Local M&S Food Store (in a small market town) stocks Magic Rock's Salty Kiss... there's some advantages to living darn sarf. 
1418 2018-07-21 18:06:22 She designed it for 35. And then later was rewarded stocks. But that also is a logo going on clothing to be sold. The community podcast isn’t selling anything other than you time.
1419 2018-07-21 18:06:20 Businesses are investing in their workers? Where? All I see is businesses buying up their own stocks, laying off workers and giving bonuses to their CEOs. Stop blowing smoke up our ass.
1420 2018-07-21 18:02:38 As a firearms owner, I have a serious problem with bump stocks, if you want a full-auto firearm, you should have to jump through a bunch of NFA hoops to do so, not run over to @DICKS and slap down $100 for a new stock.
1421 2018-07-21 18:02:17 what clothing company stocks women’s wear & goes yep size 12 is the biggest were gna go X you could lit get double the customers if you stocked 2-3 more sizes ???? don’t get it ???
1422 2018-07-21 18:01:18 Its such a tiny market, any move in the U price gives big gains to the stocks
1423 2018-07-21 18:00:59 Ah, but he's just a simple guy that knows struggle...remember he had to sell some of the stocks his dad gave him to pay off his student loans.
1424 2018-07-21 17:58:40 Why are those that do their homework and build a diversified portfolio of stocks viewed to be more confident than an indexer that doesn’t pay any attention to the markets and only expects stocks to go up? Which is overconfidence bias?
1425 2018-07-21 17:57:53 Look it up. Unemployment when obama took office and where the stocks were. You will see obama built a solid foundation with regulations in place that trump is destroying. And our environment. As well as immigration taking children away from parents
1426 2018-07-21 17:56:25 I'm not a member of AC but I follow their tweets and study their charts. Out of necessity, I currently trade CFDs and that "limits" me to larger cap stocks. I say limit, but I actually love it. I'm glad that I converted to large cap land. Still working on my consistency.
1427 2018-07-21 17:55:52 Me: So what does your bf do?

Me: Omg I KNEW it!

Friend: .....like at Wal-Mart. He stocks things. At night.
1428 2018-07-21 17:54:32 Sure. But stocks and houses aren’t really appropriate things to compare this way, because one of them is not a basic human need, and the other is.

1430 2018-07-21 17:52:45 Actually, in retrospect, I like “If dotcom stocks were a currency” more. 

Funny to think of the wild extremes of what BTC could end as, and of the delta between hopes/fears.

1433 2018-07-21 17:50:46 Tsla is one of those stocks that will react violently downward once perception changes. You're either short now or you will probably miss it...
1434 2018-07-21 17:49:15 Snarky: “Dotcom stocks but in coin form.”

Nicer: “Wealth without banks or borders.”
1435 2018-07-21 17:45:31 Just a reminder that we still don’t have a national ban on bump stocks and trigger cranks, all of this time after the Las Vegas massacre.

1436 2018-07-21 17:43:50 @SEBI_India @Wealth_Park what is the criteria to keep stocks like PC , vakrangee and suzlon on nifty midcaps 100. Throw them away from Index and derivatives. In par ASM kyun nahi lagate. @WeekendInvestng

1440 2018-07-21 17:38:09 It seems they decided to lower the risk profile & as part of a balanced portfolio introduce a small Gold element so as to attract a wider institutional investor. Needless to say when we see the #ViolentUpside all the stocks IMO will be 6-10x larger based on 2007 & 2011bull runs.
1441 2018-07-21 17:36:26 Hanging?

1442 2018-07-21 17:36:22 True but Disney is also a kids company THE kids company really. If they didnt do it and they faced backlash, negative press, the snowball effect on stocks... another company would've probably handled it differently.
1443 2018-07-21 17:36:00 I'm still keeping an eye on the website just in case but everyone's best bet is to go to your local BL *NOW*, if it's available in your area. Some got stock last night, some are getting stock on Monday. It all boils down to how your store stocks their new product.

1450 2018-07-21 17:27:53 We’ll definitely get the 2 hikes this year. Not sure why investors think otherwise & Central banker rhetoric is talking about pausing.  If they pause rate hikes/QT we will have another 2000 style bubble in stocks as the dollar craters.

1452 2018-07-21 17:23:31 Random question: idk abt stocks much so what's the diff between $TSLA and $TSLAQ? What does the q mean?
1453 2018-07-21 17:22:39 We generally need to be on the doorstep of recession to get sustainable downside in stocks and in the last two recessions, earnings revisions went negative before the recession began but as has been widely discussed, revisions are still rising.

1458 2018-07-21 17:16:49 93% of stocks are owned by 20% of Americans.
1459 2018-07-21 17:16:17 When obama went into office we were losing thousands of jobs record pace. And when I Nama left stocks up over 10000 points higher unemployment done over 5.5 percent. You need to ck your facts
1460 2018-07-21 17:14:27 You are wrong. Big companies are investing their own money in their stocks to inflate so the wealthy get wealthier.
1461 2018-07-21 17:13:52 Tax cuts r 4 rich not u. 10% of US households are shareholders of 84% stocks-that's big win 4 them, the companies, & their CEOs. Altho $436.6B of buybacks announced during 2nd 1/4 would've paid for $1,000 bonus checks to 6.8 million workers every single trading day in the quarter

1484 2018-07-21 16:46:24 Public humiliation is good. Oh I know! Since ppl move between black sites, before his next move he gets 8 hours in public stocks, cleaned up, then moved to next site (which are pure cages). That is his rotation.

1496 2018-07-21 16:37:35 Don't even need superior machines, Russia blows them out of the water w/a $60b budget. Pentagon "lost" $21t. Mostly privatised, no accountability.  They'll always have an excuse to loot US wealth.  Chem co's used Ag for their stocks after WW2. They do not care. They profit.
1497 2018-07-21 16:36:53 Hmmm sounds like chasing a play to me..I try to not buy stocks on a run, eventually it will correct and then I would enter
1498 2018-07-21 16:36:45 When to sell.....some just think ride it out but only with certain stocks
1499 2018-07-21 16:34:29 Trust me financing is available. Stock for equity deals can be done 2. It is clear domestic uranium will lead w far higher prices & reasonbly soon & we know the price spike is soon.  KAZ has said they will force $30 to $35 Spot for Q4 IPO. Stocks will rise 5X to ? So, attractive
1500 2018-07-21 16:33:25 At any point in the horizon of an _average_ investor, he's trying to put a finger on the idea of "risk". If he can't invest directly in stocks and sleep, why put money into an asset that can swing +/-50% before mid-yr? The risk profile of BTC [within crypto] is irrelevant to him.

1504 2018-07-21 16:32:27 Just finished the YouTube video. Great stuff as always. Two questions,  1) do you see stocks rising much higher from dramatic multiple increases or an actual increase in earnings driving fundamental growth. 2) would your theory be much different if Trump didn’t win the presidency
1505 2018-07-21 16:31:41 I wasn’t endorsing that specific solution but I disagree with the argument of ‘some people will disobey traffic lights so we should abolish traffic lights.’ Also, bringing up knife attacks is very relevant: imahine if they had easier access to AR15s + bump stocks. Scary thought.
1506 2018-07-21 16:31:33 This happens a lot. Shipping, telling them abt styles, their music, who to collaborate, who’s using them for clout, getting stocks, protecting them like babies etc. There’s a line bet concern & treating them like they’re brainless kids. They’re surviving in the dirtyof Kpop. ++
1507 2018-07-21 16:30:10 I *want* to think I'm smart. But ya know...

Seriously, though, I'll tell you the first trigger that made me think 'I should get back into gold': Summer 2015...I spoke on the phone with a guy I knew who was one of the biggest cheerleaders for gold and exploration stocks around...
1508 2018-07-21 16:29:33 Moats are nice and all, but I prefer stocks with private armies.  The best defense is a good offense.
1509 2018-07-21 16:29:19 How hard is it to see that #stocks - prices soaring while incomes near-flat and many incomes nil - is repeating the housing bubble pattern?

While in hindsight paying very very high PE in few cos would have earned decent returns, but most expensive stocks wouldn’t have. Survivorship bias is too high.

1519 2018-07-21 16:21:20 Copper stocks and base metals I think might lead the group. They may have more torque as they've dropped in line with copper / base metal prices recently.  FM HBM teckb RUS as examples. Especially On a usd reversal Gold silver miners vs gold silver price  still disjointed.
1520 2018-07-21 16:20:45 I don’t work in equities and I don’t recommend stocks to clients.  Your YTD nasdaq comparison is nice but I like to look forward instead of starring in the rear view mirror.

1525 2018-07-21 16:18:17 They should only invest in index funds not directly in stocks.
1526 2018-07-21 16:17:39 Okay. Quick question: should an "average" investor invest in stocks? What's your view?
1527 2018-07-21 16:16:38 So do you often recommend stocks to your clients that have fallen significantly YTD while the NASDAQ has provided a nearly 14% return over the same period?  Talk about being wrong all the time....  Anywho, twitter credentials are about as meaningful as projections from #ElonMusk

1530 2018-07-21 16:12:19 Stocks are generally more attractive when no one else wants to buy them, not when barbers are giving stock tips. It’s very tempting to look for validation—or people doing the same thing—but history has shown repeatedly that assets are cheap when everyone else is avoiding them
1531 2018-07-21 16:12:07 @SecretaryRoss Wilbur Ross He was on board of Bank of Cyprus, aka Russian money laundering bank. Also made massive $$ short selling his stocks thru insider info

Huh, sounds corrupt to me

1541 2018-07-21 16:05:39 Socialism is great, until other people’s money runs out. Taxes are based off income, not worth. So CEO’s lower their base salary to $1 , live off shares, stocks, etc.Then they move their corporations to countries that won’t tax the hell out of them.
1542 2018-07-21 16:05:15 Honestly, best stocks I own are square and Shopify. No one recommended them to me. I started using square and it was great to have consistent transactions. The first time I hung up with Shopify customer service I bought their stock. You kinda know a good thing when you see it.

1545 2018-07-21 16:04:34 That's a tough question.  Different books are more helpful at different stages in the process.  I got more out of Alexander Elder's step into my trading room at the beginning as it is more focused on Risk.  O'Neil -- is the MVP for picking and holding great stocks.
1546 2018-07-21 16:02:51 do u trade options? Or only penny stocks for your alerts?
1547 2018-07-21 16:02:47 80% of gains come in 20% of time. So an investor needs enormous patience and conviction to hold stocks for 10 or 20 years.
1548 2018-07-21 16:01:45 To be a winning trader, learn to think and act contray to our natural instincts.

1575 2018-07-21 15:32:30 It would be economic disaster. Most major ins companies are publicly traded. Stocks, indexes, 401k’s, IRA’s, and pensions would plummet. And 6m ppl work in ins. That’s an insane amount of ppl to force out of work. The stock market and economy would collapse on itself.

1610 2018-07-21 15:06:52 Small/value stocks have higher expected returns and risk than large cap stocks. However, most of that higher risk disappears in a diversified global portfolio:

1998-2018
100% Large Cap = +6.5%; worst decline = -53.1%
100% Small/Value Tilted Mix = +8.8%; worst decline = -56.7%
1611 2018-07-21 15:06:46 You're incorrect. Gold was 800 dollars in 1970, right now it is 1231. 800 dollars in 1970 is 2600 dollars today, stocks have been gone to new all time highs. I know this because I work in a gold shop and buy and sell numismatic coins.
1612 2018-07-21 15:06:08 "Can i hold this for 10 years" is the best filter for stocks i have learnt to use. Reduces the investable universe to a small set. Makes investing easier and less error prone

1620 2018-07-21 14:56:46 So, they are subject to inflation and recession like we see with coins as well as fluctuating valuations like we see with stocks. And that’s the best of both worlds I suppose.

1622 2018-07-21 14:55:54 Our money is fiat - backed by nothing, not even gold, but is storehouse of worth.  What's your point?  You'd rather own stocks than cash, b/c currency is fiat?  In budget there's consumption, and savings & investment, based on income.  Consumption might be 80%.  Cash has value.
1623 2018-07-21 14:55:18 It is outrageous for anything to trade at nearly 9 times book. But in the present conditions who seemed to care about valuations. They are buying the most expensive stocks nobody is looking for value anymore. Eventually everybody will be sucked in then we will tank.
1624 2018-07-21 14:53:52 Yes but gold stocks usually follow the business/credit/stock mkt cycle. S&P and gold stocks peaked at the same time in 07. But not this time. Gold is the only true bear market in the world. And it never lets up.

1627 2018-07-21 14:50:38 Nice artful dodge.

The tactic that Kramer is taking about works best when used on stocks that aren't liquid and don't have tons of loyal fans. I have a hard time believing that there's some conspiracy when Elon has been given unprecedented amounts of cheap capital to build Tesla
1628 2018-07-21 14:49:28 EVEN though the president of IHUB is serving a prison sentence and sold the company...it is apparent that his cronies ( or lackies) are still running the show...Why else would they spend time creating bad things to say except to manipulate stocks to their advantage.

1635 2018-07-21 14:44:21 But the market seemed to recover and ended only slightly down? Not exactly economic armageddon. It seems the reality is that the much-hyped trade war is likely to affect only a small handful of stocks as investors are betting on individual company performance.

1639 2018-07-21 14:41:55 @jimcramer I think many people who you work with are seasoned investors. What should a new investor with about 4K to put into the market buy? How often to check stocks and when do you buy more or sell? Thanks!
1640 2018-07-21 14:40:19 The point is that saying that pension funds last longer than people does NOT make stocks less risky. The only relevance of pension funds lasting longer is they are well situated to invest in illiquid assets that might offer higher returns precisely because they are illiquid.

1653 2018-07-21 14:26:05 Equity markets are a pendulum that forever swings between Unsustainable Optimism: Making the stocks scale dizzy valuations & Unjustifiable Pessimism: Making the quality stocks reasonably priced if not inexpensive.

The pendulum is now in our favour => target small-cap quality!!
1654 2018-07-21 14:25:31 Adams is a hyped product by Cashman as he has done w/several players b4. Similar to german - no command / location. Frazier on DL with another concussion - another hyped prospect. The trio should be used as trade bait but Cashman prefers to retain them until their stocks go south
1655 2018-07-21 14:24:47 A ‘roaring’ economy? And CTV even cites the Fraser Institute of all organizations and it gets refuted. Despite MASSIVE cuts and selling off of Government assets and stocks the economy was still in a depression when Trudeau was elected.

1657 2018-07-21 14:22:31 Just to be clear most of the increasing wealth disparity seems to be between those who have income and those who have wealth. Hence the reason why tackling rent seeking (e.g more wealth from land and stocks) will resolve increasing disparity.

1661 2018-07-21 14:18:19 It is a failure of capitalism. govts enable rent seeking (e.g. wealth from stocks or land) so we should tax more rent seeking activities as opposed to wealth creating activities. But that doesn't need communism, it just means fixing regulation to manage these lazy behaviours.

1695 2018-07-21 13:39:50 As stands, even if IR/VZ don't lose a single bbl/d, global crude s/d is in deficit. Assuming demand flatlines, stocks continue to dwindle, organically. If US prod +'s, even at best case projections, natural decline, combined with lack of new prod streams, consumes it.
1696 2018-07-21 13:37:34 Gold is the only currency that can’t be destroyed by man, it maintains its value for thousands of years and that makes it risk free. Find a similar stock for me. Lastly, Comparing stocks to gold is amateur hour.
1697 2018-07-21 13:36:21 True, although those "investments" only bring income in a few ways. For securities (stocks, bonds, commodities), it's by other people voluntarily trying to play the same game and losing. Dividends of course come from profits.

I'm unconcerned about the income source.
1698 2018-07-21 13:35:31 Maybe it's due to the thousands of criminals ,walking your streets, that the population knows would soon be in jail. By the way, almost all other stocks went up! People are investing in trumps America .

Stocks are artificially up b/c of buybacks, not production growth. Trumps tax cut overheated a strong economy, Fed raises rates to cool inflation.
1772 2018-07-21 12:26:56 Yes, for a layman seeing #IndusindBank at Rs.1902 and #HDFCBank at Rs.2189 , may not seem too far a difference, but when taken at FV Rs.10  #IndusIndBank is at Rs.1902 only, but #HDFCBank is at Rs.10,945. Huge difference.There are so many #largecap #stocks like this on #NSE #BSE

1780 2018-07-21 12:18:36 The chart does show that the secular bear (stock) market is still intact, as long as this ratio stays below its green trendline. Unfortunately, for gold bugs, there appears to be some room left for stocks to outperform gold in the near term (trendline sits at ~24oz).

1786 2018-07-21 12:12:59 Real threat to #stocks is that stocks now are obviously a bubble - same pattern housing went: soaring prices while incomes to pay them near flat and many incomes nil.

Nifty may be volatile, but the index leader and the respective stock leaders will have good trending move. Entry timing depends upon the swing low/high formation and confirmation. 15 or 20min

I asked them to change it from 10 down to 5, as I didn't need as much, and now I see this. I keep emergency stocks but I'm so cross with them & they are closed til Monday!

1913 2018-07-21 09:06:40 Presumably, stores have some sort of grace period in which to remove these products from their shelves? Or it is strictly a manufacturing ban and stores can continue to sell stocks of these microbead-containing products until they're depleted?

1929 2018-07-21 08:32:21 @stockfolioapp it is important to add a feature where the user can calculate the % growth from two periods of time he can select. An interaction similar to the iPhone Stocks Apps.

I would also add a free stock community service to discuss stocks and cryptos(if you want to 10x).

1936 2018-07-21 08:19:29 I dunno if you follow stocks at all, but basically some absolute bellends made a really dumbass gamble that Tesla would fail, and they’re paying for it now. Hence why “shorts” (dumbass bellends) are “freaking out” (Tesla doin’ good for itself.)

1957 2018-07-21 07:46:45 One from each of Robert Kiyosaki's "4 assets that make you rich" - stocks, real estate, business and commodities. That last one will be a huge challenge!!
1958 2018-07-21 07:44:35 Guys this is not the normal way of stock market working. Sooner or later, it will stablised. Pick good fundamentally strong and front line stocks for big gains. In my opinion midcaps and smallcaps has already corrected and it is the bottom for them.
1959 2018-07-21 07:40:18 The new ones are transferable between all companies but not all companies are using them yet. A lot have large stocks of the old ones to get rid of. I’d wait until next year.
1960 2018-07-21 07:40:03 Is it a good idea to rout for stocks to go up, just because, of stock ownership?  How many people would panic sell, if the market went south because they needed the cash, therefore losing money?  Over investment, not weathering a storm, can be a problem if pushed into pricey mkt.

1963 2018-07-21 07:30:46 Sir, don't sit in ac room, watching paid news channel and say everything is booming, come on the road ask farmer/shopkeeper/small business/salaried all are bleeding, and they have been bleeding for long now,

1965 2018-07-21 07:29:01 @contrarianEPS I need ur help with a question. Shall we buy stocks of companies going under insolvency like Lanco Infra? There are many more companies but many normal people aren't aware whether to buy such stocks or not, price/circuits not being a concern. Can u plz help/guide?
1966 2018-07-21 07:28:13 A quote from the UK Brexit contingency docs: "A food system which has an estimated three to five days of stocks cannot just walk away from the EU, which provides us with 31 per cent of our food.". This is the strongest negotiating card for EU.
1967 2018-07-21 07:28:02 I don’t have any extra stocks. I’m so sorry 
1968 2018-07-21 07:25:36 This American guys been talking to me about investing in stocks for two days and I’m done I can’t do this anymore
1969 2018-07-21 07:25:04 Exchanges formulating policies based on trailing earnings and taking a call on classification of stocks is the most absurd approach I can imagine. Our capital markets have been one the finest institutions globally. They will destroy its  stature. That is most tragic.
1970 2018-07-21 07:24:09 And if there are so many people who have no income how come demand is booming. Cars, consumer appliances, staples, food, services, restaurants...everywhere
1971 2018-07-21 07:22:22 If there is any manipulation it is by unscrupulous people to save on paying it. If anything the data understates the true figure. Nothing wrong in being unemployed but many unemployed people are gainfully employed. Drivers, servants, mechanics, contractors etc etc.

1974 2018-07-21 07:18:40 Phases of trading stocks:
1. Destined to lose 
2. Fear based trading
3. Search for the holy grail
4. Learning how not to lose
5. Consisent profits

1979 2018-07-21 07:02:52 i can't wait for @CynthiaNixon to send @NYGovCuomo to the stocks
1980 2018-07-21 07:01:14 Sir a unsalaried person is as good as unemployed, he is not contributing in GDP, what's wrong in that? Many a times we have seen sick units unable to pay later closed down, but see the manipulation level in epfo data its more than 90% most of the time,
1981 2018-07-21 07:00:53 During the first six months of 2018, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple accounted for 71% of the gain in the S&P 500. Those three, along with Mastercard and four other tech stocks, accounted for 105% of the index’s gain. The other 492 stocks were, collectively, down year to date.

1985 2018-07-21 06:55:01 i say put him in the stocks and allow the public to throw tomatoes at him for a period of 1 hour
1986 2018-07-21 06:53:24 The guns that the bump stocks are designed for were banned in 1988. It would basically be a useless door-stop in the UK.
1987 2018-07-21 06:53:22 Yes, Good Midcap stocks can be taken at anytime.  There is time period to do SIP in good companies

But I trade only in Nifth 50 stocks

1990 2018-07-21 06:47:09 Okay so with pot becoming legal in Canada and spreading across the United States, you’d think penny pot stocks would skyrocket in price -_- but so far we’ve lost some money on it. Note to others, don’t take financial advice from me.
1991 2018-07-21 06:45:50 "He should be thrown in the stocks, and have his balls whacked with a wet crumpet!" @ginayashere going full-on British on "the Tangerine WankMaggot". :D
1992 2018-07-21 06:45:15 I look at some of these stocks and I can only imagine what HODLERs are going through.
1993 2018-07-21 06:44:17 Okay im done with maltesers, combos naman. Say goodbye to your stocks tita HAHAHAHAHA
1994 2018-07-21 06:44:06 Then NF should be put in stocks from where he can broadcast his destructive ideas.
1995 2018-07-21 06:41:39 Agree and same is with downtrend. Between 2006-2008 pharma got that treatment followed by what an amazing rally for 7 years. Similarly downtrend in Tata Motors and uptrend in Britannia Nestle (some of the less popular top notch stocks)

1997 2018-07-21 06:37:25 I cant add any new followers as I have been identified as a stalker. No, just trying as hard as I can to create an interest. I have a portfolio of cannabis stocks, and those seldom speak, but when they move, they move bid. I am counting on that.

1999 2018-07-21 06:34:57 Im doing well. And unfortunately WALA. Got annoyed with the thought that it's always jam with so many people. Stocks are running out also. But I asked few friends to do my bidding. hahaha
2000 2018-07-21 06:34:26 These overvalued popular stocks may be rising even for years. But sanity will prevail one day and a value investor keeps his wallet ready for that day. Very few do that. Be the few :)
2001 2018-07-21 06:33:44 Thanks for sharing. With the state of uncertainty markets are in, I am tempted to jump to high dividend yield stocks from high growth stocks. And REC and PFC both make good contra bets. 

My list so far:

1. CPCL
2. Vedanta
3. PINCON
4. LEEL
5. HIND ZINC
5. REC
6. PNB Gilts

2003 2018-07-21 06:33:00 Cadence would giggle when she notices the stallion's look in his eyes before looking at the petitioners and other beings as usual, discussing about the agreements towards trade and arrangements for stocks.
2004 2018-07-21 06:31:28 The sabotage of Obamacare was perpetuated by the Republicans on purpose.   They dont want you to have health insurance at the same time they are intentionally poisoning you through the environment.  Look and see how many of them, and Russians are invested in health stocks.

2008 2018-07-21 06:27:42 You can’t compare risk assets (stocks) to a currency like gold,  which doesn’t pay interest or produce a cash flow stream. In the long-run stocks should always outperform gold because stocks are risk assets that must offer yield.

2016 2018-07-21 06:09:03 I can relate to what you are saying. The cheaply valued stocks which I bought recently continue to become more cheaper. Having a good understanding of the underlying business helps greatly in such situations.

2021 2018-07-21 05:58:34 Value investing is intellectually easy, but emotionally tough. It is easy to find the unloved, low priced stocks or avoid the over priced ones. The tough part is to look like fool 80% of the time by avoiding exactly what is popular

2030 2018-07-21 05:51:41 I know what Cernovich and Posebiec are about. Conspiracy and shit-stirring are their stocks-in-trade. They are agenda driven.

But I’m sitting here, reading the tweets out loud to my wife, and she’s like, “Alright, enough already. Gross.”

2039 2018-07-21 05:38:14 Incidentally all employees of Companies like Kingfisher who are sitting at home and not getting salaries are shown as employed as per the Labour Commission but do not appear in the EPF list.
2040 2018-07-21 05:35:16 Well, I sell notebooks @Nerosnotes , so I’m surrounded by stocks of empty notebooks, but I do use a LOT of pocket notebooks too
2041 2018-07-21 05:34:09 Yes you are biased. The trend is definately south for gold, I can't see any reversal in the short to medium term. Rising interest rates will keep prices subdued. Hate to say it but I am looking at exiting my gold stocks at a loss
2042 2018-07-21 05:33:35 When seasoned investors like you are showing signs of throwing the towels... imagine the trauma retail investors are going thru. This hide & seek behind 4-5 stocks won't last long. Cycle is broken. Only pains till the next cycle starts
2043 2018-07-21 05:32:40 Multibaggers happen by providence well beyond comprehension of investors.
When buying stocks buy businesses with good potential to grow at attractive valuations.
If they turn out to be multibaggers take it as a blessing rather than considering it as your business acumen.

2046 2018-07-21 05:25:32 The only thing good about Russia right now is Maria Sharapova. That's if you like tennis or play it.
Putin  was a cop. 
He doesn't realize communism doesn't work.
Just think what stocks would be like if ussr did the same thing as Berlin.

2050 2018-07-21 05:09:39 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
2051 2018-07-21 05:09:17 She also said wages are greatly increasing ......they are not.  Companies used their tax breaks just to buy back their stocks...not give their workers higher wages.  If they did that, Wall St would punish their stock prices.
2052 2018-07-21 05:08:52 My Co has never reported any data to the Labour Commission but we have to open PF accounts for all new employees and deposit real money in them. You chose- fact or fiction.
2053 2018-07-21 05:06:28 I'm not as ill informed as you think. I run a Company which hires 2000 people. I also know that jobs aren't created by Govt dictat or announcements or  but by good Economic conditions. Hiring more unproductive Govt employees may help in the short term but will come back to bite.
2054 2018-07-21 05:06:17 Think shud just allow optional black OR white shoes for the next year or 2. This allows parents to not have to spend to buy new pairs and also allow retailer/disti/manufacturers time for stocks to adjust

2070 2018-07-21 04:41:16 Soooo, yeah, this girl is getting to go to @Google for #blackhoodie18 and reverse engineer Android native code with @maddiestone! I feel like I should invest in stocks with all this luck capital I'm having this month
2071 2018-07-21 04:40:24 I've been trading stocks for a good while now and I still have no idea what I'm doing. But I'm making huge profits so I must be doing something right.
2072 2018-07-21 04:37:34 Love you coach!!! Pero turuan niyo muna ako mag trade ng stocks huhuhu

2075 2018-07-21 04:34:32 I had no clue the Flynn had traders in their family. Stocks? Bonds? Your knowledge about what is going on with General Flynn is right up there with your spelling. 
2076 2018-07-21 04:34:11 those property taxes tho

ill buy gold and stocks instead
2077 2018-07-21 04:33:46 Need to find a shop that stocks the new @BristolBears kit to see if it fits me. As an ex player I am not small and I prefer tops baggy. #HelpMeBristolBears as being  can be a nightmare. In the words of @starwars, "You are my only hope". Biggest size? 
2078 2018-07-21 04:33:29 Smartest thing for a black man or woman to do is invest in yourself and your future. If it’s stocks, your own business or property!
2079 2018-07-21 04:32:38 Govt is taking data from epfo just to manipulate emp data, what labour commission report is actual new employment generation,
2080 2018-07-21 04:31:20 can this guy in the break room shut the FUCK up about bitcoin and stocks and investments literally 0 people in this break room care
2081 2018-07-21 04:30:36 Sir, You look a case of ill informed, do you know when a factory has to report to epfo when it has >= 20 employees, suppose a factory has 18 employee and it hires 2 more and it report to epfo what epfo will report to govt generation of 20 new employment but actually it was only 2
2082 2018-07-21 04:29:24 Agree sir. But personally for me, that was the case of momentum investing went horribly wrong. Reminds me of your quote on when to leave the party of cyclical stocks or at least stay close to exit.
2083 2018-07-21 04:29:06 Hopefully now they can stop squeezing the cobolt futures down, sick of seeing cobolt stocks pummelled 
2084 2018-07-21 04:28:48 I don’t understand the point you are trying to make here, but I agree that some people have fast fingers, and think that provides a reason why we can agree that bump stocks aren’t a necessity. They don’t need to be available to the general public.
2085 2018-07-21 04:25:01 The officers at the SMC office said it was IT. Had to go there to cover open position in one of the stocks which had to be covered 4 days before expiry but wasn't successful. So now will see what happens on Monday
2086 2018-07-21 04:24:33 So many feels about that. I sometimes occasionally just click the add to bag button just to see if it stocks and the cache just hasn't caught up, not gonna lie...
2087 2018-07-21 04:23:39 "coz i'm a hooker selling stocks and my pimp is a label"

amazing. revolutionary.
2088 2018-07-21 04:21:04 So minalditahan ako nitong buyer na maglalabas siya ng pera para sa product ko, pero wala daw akong stocks. 

Sa’yo na yang pera mo, di ko kailangan ng attitudera sa team ko. ANG AGA HA! WAG AKO.
2089 2018-07-21 04:21:04 15% of Wal-Mart employees are on food stamps. Who has money to invest in stocks?
2090 2018-07-21 04:20:08 Okie okie! Sana may stocks pa nun
2091 2018-07-21 04:19:02 Tucker, You mentioned a Congressman being shot. Yes, horrible. Also horrible: #LasVegas shooting/#ParklandShooting, etc. Remember when @Potus said he'd ban bump-stocks last Feb/March? I don't see ANYTHING about it now, do you? 
 
I can say something besides "Russia": #TrumpLies!
2092 2018-07-21 04:18:43 Also, bump stocks aren’t necessary. Anyone can easily learn to fire any semiautomatic rifle at the same rate of fire as a bump stuck. Bump firing technique is easy to learn.
2093 2018-07-21 04:17:05 I track @porinju . Doesn't matter if the stocks have underperformed. We stand by him
2094 2018-07-21 04:16:31 Sige! Oct pa naman. I'll buy kaagad if ever makakadaan ako and may stocks lahat?

2097 2018-07-21 04:10:39 Who reports jobs to Labour Commissioner? EPFO is definitely more reliable as it represents jobs were amounts are being deposited in accounts. We dont want to see creation of more Govt/PSU jobs which are a drain on the nation.
2098 2018-07-21 04:09:21 Looking for an efficient broker ideally with business in Delhi to contact me. Should have an excellent dealer capable of completing orders. Don’t want recos. But may seek reports on off beat stocks. Not happy with one of my existing brokers
2099 2018-07-21 04:08:46 Ohhhhh. I’m not quite at the stage I want to do stocks but saving is good.
2100 2018-07-21 04:08:42 US STOCKS-Futures turn lower as Trump comments fan trade war fears
2101 2018-07-21 04:08:06 Upper middle class , have stocks and don’t have any debt
2102 2018-07-21 04:06:24 My brain is fried I’m over reading about annuities, cash value and stocks in insurance 
2103 2018-07-21 04:05:25 Yes! It was put to me as: “You buy your stocks every day.” Helps investors overcome/understand the sunk cost fallacy and the desire to “just get back to even” before selling a loser. Bonus: selling your losers at a loss in a taxable account generates a tax benefit!
2104 2018-07-21 04:02:56 I haven’t looked at $HAL in months. But I hate energy stocks so my opinion might suck. Looking at now
2105 2018-07-21 04:01:29 I own a general contractor business here in Vegas ? And invest in stocks. All about them Benjamins
2106 2018-07-21 03:58:34 I have no problem selling portions of my winning stocks to buy new stocks

Selling losers is way harder. This is my checklist:

1-if I wouldn't buy the stock today. Sell
2-if the story change for worse. Sell
3-if fundamentals turns bad. Sell

Remove the emotion from the decision
2107 2018-07-21 03:57:50 These small-cap sector ETFs I just posted are super illiquid-I wouldn't trade them. But they show that small, domestic companies are where the strength is at right now. Look @ the holdings and trade the strongest stocks within these ETFs not large caps $XLF $XLB $XLI $XLE my 0.02
2108 2018-07-21 03:55:23 From the previous experience... what i know is they usually have alot stocks only for famous members so 
2109 2018-07-21 03:54:11 Of course you would have to match a free product or Ether depending upon your choice.... I’m also putting myself at a disadvantage because you will have 3 stocks vs my one... but I’m ok with the stupid risk
2110 2018-07-21 03:52:27 This has no impact on SMLCAP FnO stocks Ryt?
2111 2018-07-21 03:51:26 If this is a con then it’s on the Dems. I’m doing great! Stocks are up, income is up, taxes are down. American Dream is a reality again. 
Care to explain how Obama made 200k salary a year and left office with over 40M$ in bank and 2 homes with over 15M$. Hmmmm?
2112 2018-07-21 03:49:40 Google bought YouTube for US$1.65 billion in stocks just 18 months after YouTube's creation.
2113 2018-07-21 03:48:25 you know when company does something wrong..we let them know to fix it. when an actor does wrong, depending on what it is the stations don't fire them but keeps them. But find out that NOT all agrees with them doing so stocks drop,viewers drop & it bits them in the rear.
2114 2018-07-21 03:48:08 The tax cuts for wealthy and corporations at cost of a trillion dollar deficit, plus un necessary tarriff's, over valued stocks, increasing personal dept, Stagnant wages, shrinking funding for Medicare, SS, increasing health care, not good for economy, can't blame federal reserve
2115 2018-07-21 03:47:34 They also run Legends in turns one and two. And they do also run Pro Stocks/Super Late Models as well as ACT Late Models and Mini Stocks at various points throughout the year.

2118 2018-07-21 03:44:24 Johnny, 19,000,000 gamblers?  When UUUU has 3.6?  URA already dropped their majority of UEC shares then UEC only went up since 4/2 or the start of their selling.  URA has not sold a URA share in a week so no dumping. URA only has 1.4 mil shares to go yet 12+ mil for other stocks.
2119 2018-07-21 03:43:31 Before, I used to prefer naked charts only but now to make analysis purely quantitative and objective, I think of using indicators only. Quantitative approach is capable of picking best stocks from the universe in a click which wouldn't be possible manually. #Learning #TA
2120 2018-07-21 03:40:23 Supply varies widely in crypto. half of crypto price is based off supply.  way different than penny stocks.  Bianca is correct, look at market cap not price, with crypto
2121 2018-07-21 03:39:45 You got my attention with “dumb trading.”
Then I was even more intrigued at the “stocks go up, down, sideways.”
You fucked me all up with the “delta neutral trade.”  What in the hell is that?
2122 2018-07-21 03:39:04 Nifty making new highs, midcap and smallcaps being beaten down. Great time to start cherry picking. Many good stocks available at mouth watering valuations. #dumbpicks
2123 2018-07-21 03:38:32 The movie plot thickens:pt 5

2139 2018-07-21 03:27:46 I guess Bernie don't have any stocks in McDonald's. Hey Bernie why not talk about all the billions of dollars the big companies that you have stock in and are using illegals in at minimum wages and no benefits or even pay taxes and of course no vacation pay or any days off at all
2140 2018-07-21 03:25:05 About employees getting first dibs at cheap price. Bang said this. I did NOT say boys r not getting stocks. I just WANT them to have them. Concerned they may get shafted. TMs is great 4 companies. Most do them. In this case, it could be a way to keep the boys. BH has leverage now

2153 2018-07-21 03:10:15 Okay. I’ll put myself in your shoes. But the thing is, how sure are you that the boys are or are not given the option to purchase the stocks? What makes you think they are being blatantly ‘deprived’ by the company of all these things? Do you have reliable information++
2154 2018-07-21 03:10:02 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
2155 2018-07-21 03:09:13 It’s nice that stocks are up for rich people who can afford that kind of savings. It means nothing to us poor folk.  I want to know why donald trump is allowed to discuss negotiations with putin with out the public knowing what it is about. This is OUR country.
2156 2018-07-21 03:09:08 You'll need at least that amount so that you don't have to take big risks in order to make money. The best traders/investors of all time have only compounded at like 20-40% per year, so I'd say save everything you can while watching stocks trade all that you can. It's a long game
2157 2018-07-21 03:08:58 The current list has reduced from 110 odd to 70 odd! 

The least they can do is tag which stocks fall under which all criteria & let investors decide if they think the reason is important enough! 

SEBI is being opaque!
2158 2018-07-21 03:08:57 It’s not a flaw. Cash / t-bills will underperform productive assets (ie. stocks) over the long run. Gold will under perform T-bills. Gold is bottom of the barrel except for when it has periodic spikes, and I admit they can be very powerful
2159 2018-07-21 03:08:23 Fiat currency may survive for another 50 years, by that time I would certainly be pushing daisies out of the ground. The masses have no clue so the game will continue and we have to play along. You can’t be anywhere other than the stocks right now, unless you buy physical gold.

2162 2018-07-21 03:01:48 Since boys are the ones who made the money for BH, it’s only fair to give/option to purchase stocks. Ownership is always better than getting good pay. Makes both parties accountable. In the end, if boys r happy, I am okay. I am very suspicious w SK comps bc I know corrupt it is

2172 2018-07-21 02:53:43 European and Japanese investors dumped euros and yen, driving those currencies lower and they bought U.S. dollars, driving the USD sharply higher.

2180 2018-07-21 02:51:16 Looks like exchanges are in some political pressure,  because people like adhia want investors to take out money from stock market and open pakora shop to generate employment,
2181 2018-07-21 02:50:24 If we really want to hurt trump we need to yank the stock market and sell all stocks ( c d and bond rates are decent and rising)  it’s his only fallback bragging right  everything else is tumbling down
2182 2018-07-21 02:46:24 If @twitter hadn't fixed its UI on June 15th, 2017, I would still be buying stocks and mutual funds chasing 30% annualized returns. Instead I'm nodding in agreement as Bitcoin Sign Guy tells @MartyBent to wage war against fiat infidels.

I just have one question for you do you think that Elon musk took what he said back because of a or move being that the real stocks went down when he called this guy a pedo just wondering? And by the way I am not going against him and I am not going with him.

2204 2018-07-21 02:19:00 True, but it doesn’t all have to be in  preferred stocks or any stocks in general. It can come from incorporating a revenue distribution back to help others and on top of that just placing a amazon building in some of these slower economic countries can get things moving.
2205 2018-07-21 02:17:33 1. In early 2017, banking regulators fined the bank $630 million for its negligence in stopping a Russia-based money laundering scheme, in which Russian clients engaged in illegal "mirror-trading."  (One client would purchase stocks in rubles through the Moscow branch,

And with current metallurgy, the barrel can be made slightly thinner and still perform well.

2232 2018-07-21 01:43:16 3% deposits would change the game, correct. One can only do what they can within the circumstance. My view - if I was under 45 with the appropriate risk tolerance, I’d invest down payment; in stocks specifically. $1 mil in JETCON at IPO is circa $6 now. Not them alone either.

2241 2018-07-21 01:30:35 Anyone with respectable knowledge of firearms knows that: 1. Bump stocks do not allow the weapon to shoot "full auto". 2. To accurately fire a bump stock modified weapon, one must have had expert training/experience. 3. Bump stocks and guns don't kill people- people kill people.

2277 2018-07-21 00:53:45 Of course they saw the light, that light was in the form of losing the value of their stocks, like that idiotic racist papa johns, UGH. I do hope those morons will give him a very big raise, and when the time comes, a worthy retirement.

2279 2018-07-21 00:48:58 You’re nuts man, if you had the ability to know what stocks to invest in, you could become a trillionaire way faster than it took Bezos. You’d be famous for that, and you wouldn’t need to work. You would easily be the richest man in the world.
2280 2018-07-21 00:45:59 I don’t waste any time saving others from stocks I don’t like. Anybody who has an opinion on a stock is either long, short, or has some other agenda. But no one is in the business of saving others.

2405 2018-07-20 22:39:36 @MadMoneyOnCNBC Does it make sense to encourage your friends to learn about stocks, or is it better to make friends with people who already understand them; that is if you must have friends.
2406 2018-07-20 22:37:48 & smokescreen for shorting resource stocks to advantage of international financiers in a global population boom. Treason in a time of conflict. People & cultures as bait. Hijrah.

2408 2018-07-20 22:37:01 Actually confused why $TSLA sold off today when the rest of the Spazdaq Nascrap stocks went up? 
2409 2018-07-20 22:35:21 These are the 7 stocks in finance sector that yesterday reached all-time highs:
$TSC, $CZNC, $EFC, $WRLD, $TRU, $RBCAA, $RLI
2410 2018-07-20 22:34:54 Remember when you sold all of your stocks the day after meeting with then-Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and Fed Chair Ben Bernanke . Do you work or tweet all day- Chicago is a war zone and you do nothing about it.
2411 2018-07-20 22:34:52 Does it make sense to encourage your friends to learn about stocks, or is it better to make friends with people who already understand them; that is if you must have friends.
2412 2018-07-20 22:34:47 coochie stocks have increased
2413 2018-07-20 22:29:19 The world we live in;
The Top 5 Stocks.... F.A.N.G +Microsoft = 5000 Billion Market Cap (is greater than the next 280 stocks). 100% of the gain in nasdaq came from these 5 stocks.

2414 2018-07-20 22:29:17 @marketcall what oil and gas stocks is your guest short?
2415 2018-07-20 22:26:54 Banker. made a lot off of shorting “trump stocks” $mdxg $nak old boys with trump were the dead give away. Anyway enjoy your slave wage and higher gas and food costs. Im hedge for war stocks on his relection tho. please vote for him.
2416 2018-07-20 22:24:14 Yes, we are doing well with our big boy stocks but truthfully, stay with the small caps. I have not been disappointed with them. These companies play an important role.
2417 2018-07-20 22:23:58 Talking stocks and trading is a million times better than talking politics on this POS social media platform
2418 2018-07-20 22:22:23 me when someone apologizes to me: don't be sorry! you didn't do anything wrong! you've NEVER done anything wrong in your whole life ever!!! i love you

$GDDY, $SSNC, $SQ, $SHOP, $INFY, $MSFT, $FB
2420 2018-07-20 22:19:27 I think that goes for all of us conservatives. Any tweet also that I don't comment on is invisible to others.
I have to send Tweets I want to share to my email and then copy and paste the URL to share. It's time we find a different social media site and Twitter stocks
2421 2018-07-20 22:17:24 sell your stocks around retirement or when you’re in a pinch for money. They can be a really useful for of income once you hit retirement. So quick summary, buy safe stocks, hold them, keep adding every year or month or week, and reap the benefits once you’re older.
2422 2018-07-20 22:17:15 List summarizes Russia-related lies. There are so many more:
- didn’t know Cohen paid Stormy.                                                  -  biggest electorate win ever.        - remains of US soldiers have been returned by Korea.                - no more bump stocks - gone!
2423 2018-07-20 22:15:38 D. Stocks are something you want to hold onto if you truly want to utilize the market, the key is hold onto them for years and years. People who buy low sell high, you can do it but it’s very risky. Hold onto stocks and just buildup a portfolio so when you’re older you can
2424 2018-07-20 22:15:25 Just think back 8 years when we had hapless Hodgson as manager and were one of the biggest laughing stocks of the Premier League. It's unreal how far we have come! Nobody is laughing anymore... Onwards and upwards! #LFC

2427 2018-07-20 22:12:16 Everything I’ve learned about stocks and been taught is- A. It isn’t a get rich quick tactic, you buy stocks and hold them and keep buying. B. Watch stocks you can afford, and check their prices over the past 8 months and recently to see if you are paying to high.
2428 2018-07-20 22:10:40 #stocks I'm looking for a solid investing/trading mentor. Can anyone direct me to a qualified individual or group that will help me master the art of trading? #stock #investing

2433 2018-07-20 22:04:45 2017

2436 2018-07-20 22:02:51 This doesn't come from the more rational, level-headed side of me that advocates for justice...but when Trump is arrested, can we temporarily resurrect the practice of sitting criminals in the stocks and pelting them with rotten vegetables?
2437 2018-07-20 21:59:23 Don’t forget to ask Paul what other stocks he likes !!
2438 2018-07-20 21:58:18 Hahahah this web of theories going since last night keeps getting bigger and bigger and I’m here for the drama! Except come on, some of these ideas are silly haha #BBLF #bb20
2439 2018-07-20 21:57:43 That's the best way to do it if you're going to stay with stocks. You can even choose different stocks so that you get a dividend each month of the year.
2440 2018-07-20 21:57:16 $GS was expecting same last quarter when $appl did well.. So I would ignore this. But thank you for proving me the information.
2441 2018-07-20 21:55:52 Yeah it just so happens that the day trump was elected stocks skyrocketed higher than ever before! Yep! You’ve got me convinced!
2442 2018-07-20 21:55:44 You have an agenda.  Follow it and continue to keep jobs coming, stocks up, jobs for US , and you’ll be appreciated from the majority!
2443 2018-07-20 21:54:26 This is true. I owned $nak on short squeeze and shorted it down to its pennies. Also shorted $mdxg as its a fraud. fundamental connection. Billed as “trump stocks” jajaja. Anyway you guys are screwed.
2444 2018-07-20 21:53:45 Ha ha ha ha ha really you don’t want to say “it’s because of Obama’s policies”? Economy and stocks went up with Trump and you said it. Health care went up 130% since ACC and you’re blaming Trump? Wow! You’re a fool or think people yourself talking to are
2445 2018-07-20 21:53:16 Hmmm. I wonder how times the smartest people in the room said that Amazon (1994) and Apple (1976) were "shit stocks".  #XRP #Ripple
2446 2018-07-20 21:52:31 I'll look at it... I hate risk too much. Our stocks are almost all based on dividend potential lol
2447 2018-07-20 21:52:20 FACT: Worker pay in the second quarter dropped nearly one percent below its first-quarter level.

FACT: Wages fell 1.4 percent from 2017, effecting 80% of industries & 2/3 of metro areas affected.

FACT: Worker wages drop while companies spend $700 billion to boost stocks
2448 2018-07-20 21:52:08 You know, one can make a lot of money capitalizing on #Leftist outrage - wait for some CEO to be fired, make the news, then stocks tank. Buy stocks, wait for public relations campaign, then sell once the stock rallies. I use the extra cash for weapons, ammo, night vision
2449 2018-07-20 21:52:00 And who the heck stocks Diet Sipple in the Grape Jitter slot?? I got ROBBED!
2450 2018-07-20 21:51:18 I believe you meant to say that the deficit will INCREASE by $1 Trillion. Try to keep up. BTW, stocks we're on a record streak of increases before Trump. Again, try to keep up.

2452 2018-07-20 21:47:46 Well he picked the same defensive options on both of those stocks, you capitalized on it and took both his stocks fairly quickly. Kudos
2453 2018-07-20 21:47:11 @DeutscheBank disgraceful that DB Portugal trading desk not working. Clients could not buy or sell stocks in US this afternoon. Will you compensate clients for losses/opportunitu cost ? Lawsuits coming . #incompetence @SomosABANCA

2455 2018-07-20 21:45:06 @catosletters is a pro at Canadian markets (and biz in general). What’s your take on private storefronts, and existing P/Es on pot stocks?
2456 2018-07-20 21:44:20 < who don't need the cuts because they have enough to live off of and with excess. Use the money saved to buyback their stocks or save it while pushing their agenda of a "trickle down economy" which doesn't work. Then there are those who say >
2457 2018-07-20 21:43:57 There is NO other ETF traded on US Exchanges that provides broad exposure to #uranium stocks as Global X Uranium ETF $URA provides.  You either buy the ETF or your own basket of U stocks.  For millions who want a one-trade in & out sector investment vehicle, there is no other.
2458 2018-07-20 21:43:41 When will it be back in stocks could you please allow more to be sold as people haven't been able to get them and really want them but weren't able to purchase.
2459 2018-07-20 21:42:51 You're on the dock? My condolences. I tried to get my stocks too but didn't make it. I hope you do, I don't envy you in that. Just try to remember that the job isn't worth your life.
2460 2018-07-20 21:41:37 Hi Drojc. In a nutshell Global X decided last fall at bottom of #uranium cycle to change from 100% #U3O8 stocks to a 70/30 mix of Uranium/Nuclear stocks. To do that they had to sell a large quantity of U stocks, which they've been doing for last 6 months, driving down U stocks.

2464 2018-07-20 21:38:03 It takes lots of imagination power to write a novel of the scifi fantasy genre. It may sound funny, but the page count made me to give this book a try. It indicates the author's rich word stocks and I love to learn new words. The secondary reason is d novel includes  time travel.
2465 2018-07-20 21:34:22 My hero, Peter - what I think he really was saying is buy stocks at a discount that you can hold out 3-5 years, or buy when others don’t, and sell when you think you need to.

A SELL-OFF in China's currency deepened after the central bank moved to free up capital for banks and as investors braced for the next round in an escalating trade dispute with the United States. Stocks headed for a two-year low, while bonds rose. The yuan slid  0.72%
2487 2018-07-20 21:17:02 Not for pot stocks, it’s an added risk.

2495 2018-07-20 21:09:50 What's fun to do is to pick out individual stocks in alpha architect's momentum ETF, QMOM, and look at the price charts. It's pretty mind blowing seeing frog-in-the pan momentum in the real world.
2496 2018-07-20 21:08:47 Great thread ty, some questions I hope you'll consider.

You say this is good strategy for btc and larger caps...

What about forex? Commodities? Stocks? Top 20 alts or less?
2497 2018-07-20 21:05:01 I’m feeling very optimistic about the stocks I’m in heading into the fall. I would like to start accumulating more $fat and $grat at least levels.  Waiting on a few picks too run and I will start to heavily purchase.

2522 2018-07-20 21:00:24 Price is always right, markets that are efficient reflect sentiment. We are/were in a bear market because of the incredible bull last year, especially the move over 10K. The only thing different with Bitcoin is that we know the supply, more like stocks than forex.

2526 2018-07-20 20:59:26 U.S. stocks inched lower Friday as bond yields jumped, a shift that helped banks but hurt companies that pay big dividends. The dollar fell after President Donald Trump said China is manipulating its currency.

2531 2018-07-20 20:56:29 This is year 9 of a 9 year expansion.  Stocks hitting new highs, etc.  How stifling & job-crushing could these regulations be?
2532 2018-07-20 20:54:36 Those would be the same bump stocks that @realDonaldTrump said he was going to ban the next day back after the Las Vegas mass shooting?

2535 2018-07-20 20:51:23 The Wall Street junkies and the politicians, make their money no matter what goes on, if the economy is bad the politician still make their money, if you buy stocks whether they are good or bad was it a customer makes money or not Wall Street makes their money, LOL

2539 2018-07-20 20:48:54 Regardless of what a store stocks, it's employees shouldn't mock people's preferences?

If that's really the issue, saying "our ya section is there, but we don't carry much. What ya books do you read? I could help you find a book in a similar genre" is just better salesmanship

2541 2018-07-20 20:46:35 You are using the typical Dem Projection.  We know exactly what the Dems are up to by what they accuse President Trump of doing.  It is comical to watch.  Seriously, the Democrats are laughing stocks.

Public: ‘Yes’ (just) 

2 years later... 

Government: ‘We are delivering the red scarf you wanted’. 

Public: ‘You didn’t ask us what colour we wanted.’ 

Everyone #Brexits stage right and stocks up on mini cheddars.

The End
2552 2018-07-20 20:34:39 Only the free market can decide the true value of anything. Charity is nice but there's no reason to expect it from employers. 
Smart responsible people invest in stocks for retirement, not envy.
2553 2018-07-20 20:32:10 Was having a good day, check all my stocks thinking I’m banking sike.. you owe money
2554 2018-07-20 20:31:57 Feels like the end of 2015 with the gold stocks.. then it just said poff in two-three months fucked those trades up so badly
2555 2018-07-20 20:31:46 My current employer stocks string cheese as part of their office snacks. I had forgotten how magical and delicious string cheese really is. Childhood me knew what was up
2556 2018-07-20 20:31:07 The more "good news" you post the worse the stocks acts....You do realize that don't you?
2557 2018-07-20 20:30:57 Why does my phone autocorrect to the word ‘sticks’ when I’m trying to type about ‘stocks’?! I don’t talk about sticks.
2558 2018-07-20 20:30:37 There are so many stocks out there but they are not all the same. There are so many real estate properties but they are not the same. #StartupChats

2562 2018-07-20 20:28:04 $TRXC it’s been a good week to be long. No mo posting. I’ll be chill til Monday. At least I’ll try, but I’m kinda hooked on stocks
2563 2018-07-20 20:27:18 Obviously you have no stocks, or a job or pay taxes or you would know without asking! I believe in proof, get some and we'll talk then!
2564 2018-07-20 20:25:32 Is that your favorite platform for individual stocks?
2565 2018-07-20 20:25:14 If you only have $100, investing in stocks is the very last financial decision you should make.
2566 2018-07-20 20:25:13 It is till my contention we are at the low of this cycle of trading on Gold and Silver.  I said the same thing a about 3 weeks ago . We are at very slight lower levels on some G & S stocks from that time.
2567 2018-07-20 20:24:00 #financialplanning and #retirementplanning is all about managing risk. Having a portfolio of just stocks will NOT cut it the next time the market crashes.

Most of my clients come to me with waaaaay more stocks than they should have.

When was the last time you checked?
2568 2018-07-20 20:23:39 It can literally trigger in a month. Economy isn't much of an indicator how the country is doing, just how the 1%, which owns almost all of the stocks are doing. But 2021 is my most conservative estimate.
2569 2018-07-20 20:23:35 Also I think you buy a lot of stocks from twtr peoples post. Which is extremely dangerous
2570 2018-07-20 20:23:04 Honestly, don’t take this the wrong way why are all your stocks so cheap? What’s ur strategy is it to find a diamond in the right cheap that’s a 5-10 bagger? Those are extremely rare FYI and 98% will lose u money. Think that’s why you’re losing money on these ones but that’s my2c

2580 2018-07-20 20:15:09 World stocks ex Asia slightly lower: US -.1%; Europe -.2%. Markets balancing Trump's increasingly strident Tariff warnings against solid 2Q earnings-growth. Short-term money should remain on the sidelines. Longer-term money can find a home with high-quality stocks. Some cash OK.

2585 2018-07-20 20:12:34 Lots happened. Real estate got shellacked. And Telecom Utilities MLPs too.
So market did OPPOSITE of what biased media concocted. Whereas you tweeted about pressure on Fed by Trump, stocks acted as if rates shall RISE.

2590 2018-07-20 20:10:07 I keep hearing lower and middle class Trumplings talking about all this extra money in their pay checks. Who... what... when...?!? My taxes went up last year. Everythang went up except my stocks. So... wtf?!?

2607 2018-07-20 19:56:52 @realDonaldTrump @larry_kudlow Treasuries extended losses and stocks fluctuated as concern about a an escalating trade war outweighed this week’s positive corporate earnings reports. NOT GOOD FOR MID-TERM VOTES!! Hold off Tariffs!
2608 2018-07-20 19:55:12 Low volumes portend danger ahead.  Especially with so few stocks (3) that have been juicing the S&P.  Insiders appear to be bailing out in record numbers.  At some point the boost supplied by repatriation and tax cutting will fade.  Perhaps that is what we're seeing now.

2615 2018-07-20 19:50:23 @AgriTalkATB #chipatb @ksetzergrains long term, are these low prices going to be a blessing in disguise by helping spur demand and grind through stocks? Couple that with possibly a short squeeze when trade deals worked out? Could be interesting. Just my thoughts from the big road
2616 2018-07-20 19:49:02 So you bought stocks?. Please explain
2617 2018-07-20 19:48:21 they aren't stocks
2618 2018-07-20 19:48:00 Its easy for you to say that. You do not do what we do.We see how the world works,and its not a nice place.Its dog eat dog so to speak.Also, managing fish stocks is fine, but there seems to be very lityle of that done these days.
2619 2018-07-20 19:46:04 Arguably all Companies should have some resilience. I don’t like the fact that the grocers also only have 36 hours of food stocks in their warehouses.

2628 2018-07-20 19:36:40 Bought multiple stuff to diversify and you start learning about it better when there is already money on the table. That works well with stocks but in crypto it seems to broaden your exposure to risks (hacks, scams, etc.) Slowly bringing most investments back to XRP, ADA, BTC.
2629 2018-07-20 19:36:31 You like to position trade, I day trade options in couple hours, two days span max, it's just like day trading stocks, I just don't have to pay margin borrowing cost

2636 2018-07-20 19:33:00 La diferencia entre tus datos (micro) y los los míos (macro) la explico, tal vez, por los stocks. Ahora están vendiendo stocks acumulados el 2017. Por eso quiero sentarme a charlar.
2637 2018-07-20 19:32:58 Here’s the thing - some of these things do describe me. I have stocks, still have a good job, and got a tax cut. But you what? I won’t sell out my country to keep those things. That’s the difference between a patriot and a traitor.
2638 2018-07-20 19:32:54 Institutional money announcement.

It will NOT enter in one lump sum from a single company portfolio. A portfolio is made up of 100s of stocks. IF a fund is 100 million, you can bet your ass only 10% is crypto. That's 10m. 100m will not enter from a single fund. #Crypto #bitcoin

2646 2018-07-20 19:30:34 $SPY I continue to mainly focus on individual stocks but think it worth being more cautious at these higher levels. Cash on the side is good
2647 2018-07-20 19:30:27 But what if I'm older than you and I'm a male?... Am I your third uncle from cousin George's roomate snake pet who shares stocks with Donald Trump? 
2648 2018-07-20 19:30:14 To anyone that knows stocks, which one would you make investments towards?
2649 2018-07-20 19:29:40 we need time to build up world biscuit stocks
2650 2018-07-20 19:29:14 So, I think the shorts probably learned of the URC details and may have to consider covering. This is just me. If their position trends up in the next 2 weeks I will know I was wrong. If UEC price trends up on oddly high volume consistently vs other stocks will infer I am right.
2651 2018-07-20 19:28:58 no more. I am not opening any new positions on biotech stocks. Now focus on $AXON and $FCSC, and other gene therapy biotech stocks.
2652 2018-07-20 19:28:20 Finally feel like I solved my issue with cutting losses and sticking to my plan to get out when it goes wrong. Now I have to work on not forcing what's not there and trading a ticker over and over and over again like an idiot. #stocks #trading #DayTrading
2653 2018-07-20 19:28:06 One thing I am noticing is Brazil stocks are up big.  Look at EWZ.  So, there's some movement to emerging markets.

2656 2018-07-20 19:25:35 A/ France only ever has 10. That is what is in their Government White Paper
B/ Of course Trident is a US design. Subject is the submarines themselves, though, not Trident.
C/ Size does matter for endurance/stocks/munitions. Rubis has no land attack, and less capable torpedoes.
2657 2018-07-20 19:25:11 Risk Management tools are options. Stocks are for those people, who need to have the "i'm a long term trader" in their back pocket for bad trades.

2671 2018-07-20 19:17:06 One way to think of it: social democracy wants to find ways that those who can’t participate in a capitalist economy can still benefit from it.
Not everyone can buy stocks or invest in VC funds. Social democrats want to expand the effect.

2780 2018-07-20 18:14:03 i get that but just google the term “pump and dump” in stocks itll make sense
2781 2018-07-20 18:13:49 I am amazed that tons of people still buy and sell stocks based on shapes they perceive in squiggly lines. In 2018. #wtf
2782 2018-07-20 18:13:37 Chapstick stocks just went thru the roof...does it get anymore Nazi than this...don’t answer that
2783 2018-07-20 18:13:31 Stocks close slightly slower, trimming earlier losses

2785 2018-07-20 18:13:19 I said how the economy is doing. 
No I didn't sell my stocks, nor was there expert consensus that I should.
And I answered about Reaganomics, as well.
2786 2018-07-20 18:12:50 Didn't want to hoover them all up knowing that you'd be all over them this summer. Limited stocks, high value items.
2787 2018-07-20 18:12:16 You see "stocks of Spam" haven't heard this scare story before, quite inventive, although the only spam here is your tweet

There is nothing for nurses. Nutrition stations stocked for patients have big signs that state: “PATIENTS ONLY”

2792 2018-07-20 18:10:12 3. Yes, compounding to get over 100K happened with a ton of different stocks over a period of time. And they were up trending when I traded them. Once you have a large account, it’s easier to day trade since you have leverage with the amount you can afford.
2793 2018-07-20 18:10:02 Just past midday, Mortgage Bond prices are lower. Stocks holding modest gains. 10-yr yield rises to 2.89%.

2796 2018-07-20 18:07:57 40 sounds better and knows most his base doesnt have money in stocks so they wont check. Go Big or Go Home when it comes to politcal lies. IE Obama is a muslim not born in America.
2797 2018-07-20 18:07:26 I think you seem to have convinced yourself that this was a good trade, selling a downtrending asset for another downtrending asset with zero utility to buy back the downtrending asset u already owned in the first place. Better to buy stocks or hold cash (off exchange).

2802 2018-07-20 18:04:13 Jobs ? Wages are stagnant. The rich are getting richer. The tax break, instead of giving wage increases, they re-invested in their company stocks. Ppl are under employed with low wages and no health insurance. Lincoln was hated for saving the Union from biggest like you..

2805 2018-07-20 18:01:28 I’ve a lot of time for his views on stocks. A focussed non-scattergun approach on quality mining growth stocks. Glad he’s putting blogs out now 
2806 2018-07-20 18:01:11 Can you imagine the Red Scare and McCarthy type hysteria which will occur in news coverage and political ads if #Putin comes to the US at #Trump’s request during a mid-term election? Now’s the time to invest in Bomb Shelter stocks!

2809 2018-07-20 17:59:54 1. Yes, most penny stocks are OTC, but so also trade on the larger exchanges. It depends on things like their market cap and the value of their shares. 

2. They buy 1 share because that is all they can afford. That’s a rookie move. If you look at Netflix today....
2810 2018-07-20 17:57:59 So far Tilray has lost about US$46 million in operations. The IPO would have been a big win for Privateer, though. They took the risk and they get the reward. 
It is an irony that #cannabis stocks can list in the U.S. as long as they don't have U.S. operations.

2825 2018-07-20 17:49:29 Hmm. It works for me. If pple just graduate high school, get a job, and refrain from having a child illegitimately, everyone stands a chance at being middle class. (A study from a left wing school even said that) and anyone can buy stocks. She’s BS ing. Or off her meds

2829 2018-07-20 17:46:17 I received a nice glossy(ish) pack inviting me to have my pensions reviewed through the post (despite being on the postal preference service).

2831 2018-07-20 17:44:09 Back in the day in stocks there used to be actual market makers, you could see the various brokerages in the order book. Now order books are anonymous, everyone is a market maker. I can't believe how long I spent trying to figure out what a mm was when I first started tho.

2841 2018-07-20 17:39:17 @Olywal I think u're being unfair with your expectations for NPFL transfers.

In Africa, sub 1m transfers are still the norm, El-Kaabi & co are just exceptions.

2860 2018-07-20 17:30:23 I bet if we could see his stock portfolio we would see he is selling high, then impose more tariffs and let the market tank and then he comes in buys stocks at its lowest. Also he is probably using money he borrowed from Russians.

2902 2018-07-20 17:05:57 #3. I’d stop 9/11 by stopping the flight school training. And I’d  invest in certain stocks. Probably be more into my education & maybe not so hung over for the SATs (altho I did fine, I just still remember the hangover!) And the men I dated would be from a different roster!!

2954 2018-07-20 16:37:43 Thank you for not being rude, like many are.

I simply can't go for bump stocks for "normal" use.  Especially with the risk they create.

Silencers, belonging to a range,  for use on the range, could make sense. I just see them as an unnecessary risk in the "outside" world.
2955 2018-07-20 16:37:21 They say "buy low sell high", but my strategy of buying stocks while I'm depressed and selling them after eating half a pan of magic brownies hasn't helped my financial situation.

3025 2018-07-20 16:06:19 As you grow your account you can start dabbling in larger cap stocks. Now before you do this, paper trade on this level. This is a whole other league. One of my favorites is $TSLA Tesla. It’s over $300 per share. And it can gain or lose $40 in a short time frame.

3029 2018-07-20 16:04:00 In mind. This is why it is 100% critical to practice by paper trading. And I recommend paper trading for 6 months. Doing this for 6 months will show you how stocks truly work and you will see price actions for various levels of stocks. If you don’t paper trade. I will f*** up!

3042 2018-07-20 15:55:18 FWIW stocks that breakout, pullback AND hold that prior level are my favorite setups. 

Obviously not the only way & not contradicting your methods by any means! Many ways to succeed. Look at @traderstewie with those falling wedge setups!
3043 2018-07-20 15:55:00 it is so important to know what the big trend is that you might be "trading"... if you are taking short-term stabs based on stocks without knowing whether they are rising or falling in the week to week and month to month action, you are missing important info

3045 2018-07-20 15:53:38 ETC has more free borrows on mid/largecap stocks, but will never have borrows on low float small caps. Vision has borrows on all the small cap stuff, but you'll also have to pay for locates on the higher priced stuff. So which clearing firm you choose depends on what ur trading.

3047 2018-07-20 15:52:50 They will be $6.95 per transaction with TDAmeritrade. So a buy is $6.95. & a sell is $6.95. So to start you will be able to use $244.05 for this strategy. As you buy ur shares just remember, you trade penny stocks in percentages, not dollars...

3062 2018-07-20 15:45:07 Ninth, now to start answering your question lol. Penny stocks is a good place to start if you are not trading with a large account. But only if you know what you’re doing. Because it’s unforgiving! 90% lose their money in the first few money, if they even last that long.
3063 2018-07-20 15:44:08 The top 4 stocks by market cap are $AAPL $AMZN $MSFT and $GOOG. The acronyms #MAGA and #GAMA work out nicely. Let’s make this a thing so Wall Street can stop trying to figure out how to fit more ticker symbols into #FANG.

3072 2018-07-20 15:39:05 20% of the stocks would create 80% of the wealth. And 80% of the wealth would be created in 20% of the time. So have a focused portfolio and be prepared for lumpy returns.

3073 2018-07-20 15:39:01 .... this paper trading is real-time data, meaning it’s the real price actions for the stocks you’re trading. Doing this will show you your level as a trader. ITS THE ONLY WAY TO BECOME SUCCESSFUL! Don’t believe the people who say earn while you earn. They are selling memberships
3074 2018-07-20 15:38:46 Implicit in your statement is that $1200 is a realistic price.

Unless you are a very old & experienced investor, a highly concentrated portfolio should have at least 10 stocks. 

Why? 

So that even if 1 stock goes to zero, your portfolio doesn't fall more than 10%, all other things being equal.

3424 2018-07-20 13:15:23 I feel from Nov 2018, we will start seeing a strong upside movement in mid cap stocks. Just my intuition, also additionally i feel as the picture for 2019 election becomes clearer the movement will be tremendous.
3425 2018-07-20 13:13:33 500 people in minutes is not a actual number just a saying to get your point across and bump stocks are easily accessible and the Vegas attack and pluse all had high numbers in minutes

3450 2018-07-20 12:57:42 You rightly pointed but what exchanges are doing they are allowing manipulation, just moving 5 stocks and Index will go up and down.   Why they are not allowing future trading in midcap index or broder index, just focusing Nifty

3464 2018-07-20 12:51:03 In my experience getting inpatient with stocks is when you lose money. Stay patient and you’ll see the rewards 
3465 2018-07-20 12:50:40 I see bottom stocks on 30 minutes chart are:

3466 2018-07-20 12:50:25 Want to hear a secret about penny stocks? 100% of them are complete garbage. No "good" company's stock price would be worth 6c lets be real, their only good for P&D's and & the only people getting rich are the guys promoting them. Literally transferable knowledge for 99% crypto
3467 2018-07-20 12:50:20 They’ll check ur profile to see what they recommend, either conservative or risky. Conservative goes into savings (asking them to remove that because interest) and currency holdings. Risky goes into more stocks

3470 2018-07-20 12:48:08 I'm not aware of any research strongly supporting that. I don't think it's accurate to say stocks or commodities "hedge" inflation, given how much more volatile they are.
3471 2018-07-20 12:47:50 If the $USD weakens, then stocks (priced in US dollars) could go much higher, right? In a hyper-inflationary scenario, dow could go to 100k, but bread and milk could go to $20?

3484 2018-07-20 12:40:00 Stocks and crypto are stark opposites. One is underlined by real assets, production, results and utility. The other is held up by a bunch of people hoping it works out so they sell/buy to each other hoping to get rich.

3487 2018-07-20 12:38:13 So disrespecting the country as a whole and hurting business stocks just to prove a retarded race point that could have been done in a much better less harmful and more respectful way?

3489 2018-07-20 12:36:16 Eliminate fear by taking a multi-decade investment view. The longer your time horizon, the less risky stocks become. If you need the cash in <5 years, that money shouldn't be in the market anyway
3490 2018-07-20 12:35:45 I agree plus I think metals over summer will have a rise. So plenty will be happening around mining stocks as well.

3491 2018-07-20 12:35:34 Sadly, he won't provide proof he's shorting these stocks as he can't. But he has no issue with telling others to throw their money away to provide himself an (unlikely) opportunity to call himself a genius
3492 2018-07-20 12:35:08 Browder hurt the ordinary Russian people by scamming them out of their ownership of stocks to make billions for his buddies. Read his book with opened eyes. Ask yourself, who does that and is proud of that? Just like Soros who screwed the Russian people with B Clinton's approval.
3493 2018-07-20 12:32:24 Timing is very important. I read Browder's book & came to my own conclusion that he was of poor character. He was way too proud scamming regular Russians out of their stocks and making billions for his pals. If you were the leader of Russia, you'd be mad too.
3494 2018-07-20 12:32:13 AMOC flat-lining could also have large impact on fish stocks, nutrient movement and carbon sink with less sequestration and changes in the thermocline.
3495 2018-07-20 12:32:04 I think it also depends on the size of your portfolio. Sometimes one large holding like BRK for example could offer a lot of inherent diversification. For me I like 10 to 15 stocks but can at times have my top 4 stocks take up 50% of the portfolio value.

3540 2018-07-20 12:07:54 Whilst I agree in general, in our post-brexit world, anything that protects our food crops will be needed. If there is no alternative to these pesticides then they must be used. Hate to say it, but green concerns will be secondary to food stocks.

3548 2018-07-20 12:01:20 @JoeSquawk @BeckyQuick sell tech and buy bonds and dividend stocks - that will make you money- if I had quit listening to that lie 5 years ago, I would have tripled my investments

3552 2018-07-20 11:58:35 @Willsncz @Nethilez @Puertorock77_ @almightynxtgen1 I find it interesting whenever Sony reveals information that gets their core gamers excited Xbox guys post everything non Xbox related. “Microsoft stocks are up 10%” I don’t give a fu@k myG where da games is at?
3553 2018-07-20 11:58:33 There are 4 stocks I am bullish on at current market price:
1. IBM [4.5% Dividend Yield, Underowned, and Turning around]
2. General Motors [Softbank Investment in Autonomous division, frees up cash for shareholders]
3. Kroger [Big Retail Turnaround]
4. MRO [High Oil Price Play]
3554 2018-07-20 11:57:23 Definitely 3. Why? Fun but also I could go back in time to invest in stocks that will make me $100 million. I could wait on the station platform to grab a seat next to my soul mate - or other feasible situation  - and win his heart. That way I also get what's behind 1 and 2.
3555 2018-07-20 11:56:39 What carries S&P 500 are very high-multiple stocks - none of which would be picked up by any quant strategy that had a smidge of quantitative value evaluation. But was that different in the past - there were always market darlings...
3556 2018-07-20 11:56:27 Look into the oil stocks Trump's in owns as well as the banks that will tell alot ....

3558 2018-07-20 11:54:57 Trump’s pick? Now is this a solid pick? Trump is never sure about what he said, did, didn’t do, or will do, not do. Sooooooo.......bump stocks turning AR-15’s into automatics, to spray children at school, are still available on-line.

3560 2018-07-20 11:54:27 Fine - I’m clearly not going to change your view so I’m done here - you win! I just write what I think about stocks and, in this case, I believe a valuation of £200m for a nascent loss-making graphene business is too high. Simples! Good luck with your holding.

3565 2018-07-20 11:51:47 Looking at market this morning NASD up strong with Microsoft earnings. The sp is slightly lower after having a whipping night of light trade. Watch the bank stocks today to key the market today. Sp should trade back to week high at some point as long as tech holds in.
3566 2018-07-20 11:51:04 And they don’t realize that as the markets change direction even great stocks will not move in the direction they expect.

"You should really buy a house. Renting is throwing away money."

"You shouldn't invest in stocks. Remember 2008?"

"You should buy a nicer car. You work hard."

I am of the Opinion that New Set of Stocks will lead this leg.

Old Stocks could be a 'Sell on Rise'
(Old Stock means, Stocks where Retail Investors are Invested.)

3643 2018-07-20 10:52:46 The drop in stocks is paring a bit. Are people realizing that when Trump says "ready to go" he means "ready" in the "I was born ready" sense?

Agreed that comparing IVs have no real value.
However, stocks with extremely high IVs(e.g. 200+ in case of PCJ) can tell us which stock has huge swing possibility or where a major event has happened or about to happen

3784 2018-07-20 08:46:54 Decline in stocks is not a surprising event. It recurs. If you live in cold climate, you expect freezing temperatures and when it drops below zero you don't think of this as the beginning of the next ice age. You know summer will be warm again. Stocks do the same. -Peter Lynch

Never again! I only trade long in a couple of individual stocks now.

Glad you got out OK dude. Could have been much worse.
3904 2018-07-20 06:53:56 It worked for many if u have seen on britannia which i am carryying from 5040 is also a good eg for it.
There are few more, back testing this strategy for portfolio movers works and a daily close also helps me to take call on stocks which i am holding

3907 2018-07-20 06:52:30 One reason was excess valuation of Midcap stocks.
Second being lots of stocks running up without any fundamental backing these stocks deserves a beating.
Holding on to quality Midcap with business visibility can be added systematically via SIP routes . Preferably through MFs
3908 2018-07-20 06:51:48 When I first started putting the list together I was surprised when I went past the 50 mark...then the 100 mark...then the 150 mark. For all the moaning we all do about film stocks being discontinued there's still an incredible amount of choice out there and it's still growing.

3924 2018-07-20 06:36:46 However, we are confident about the long term potential of these stocks, which is why we continue to hold them in our portfolio. The exit of BlackRock has no effect on the way we manage our funds as the processes will continue to remain the same as before. 2/3

3979 2018-07-20 05:39:28 While value stocks (penny stocks) carry high risk with them, this also leads to high rewards (positive relationship), and the inverse property holds true for growth stocks... high prices mean low risk which means low future returns per annum.

4036 2018-07-20 04:38:42 @Grailstartrader what moves first?  Do they individual stocks move the indices or do the indices move the individual stocks.  When futures move, how do they know which stocks move in harmony?
4037 2018-07-20 04:38:40 Completely agree 100%. That’s what I’m saying, change the laws to require someone that makes that much money off their employees to pay a living wage that is well above the poverty line. I just think it would be hard to take anything he already earned outside of stocks maybe

4150 2018-07-20 02:47:18 I usually don’t day trade lower cap stocks like $JCP. I get antsy waiting as long as I did to make the amount that I’d like. Day trading is a lot easier when you have leverage. But I grew my account short swinging penny stocks & low caps in their uptrends.
4151 2018-07-20 02:41:49 @8FigureTrading then again, many stocks I trade are under the radar.
4152 2018-07-20 02:41:06 This one time I thought my friends were having a serious grownup talk about how they bought stocks and needed to check on them....20 min or so later I find them checking their Neopet stocks. I shouldn’t have believed my friends are actual adults in the first place.

4156 2018-07-20 02:39:16 Fantastic. For shits & giggles! I first laid eyes on Trump in a tv interview@in ‘79. He was a smug flippant ass even then. I read The Art of the Deal in the 80s. Hubby & I stayed out of stocks per our broker. We survived the ‘87 crash just fine! Stupid then, stupid now.
4157 2018-07-20 02:39:13 4/17 and took 5 stocks in the crew battle. Nice weekly.

4167 2018-07-20 02:31:45 But then how did you pick this stock? Will you keep monitoring all the stocks during trade hours for buy sell signals ? Yours is decision point trading I presume
4168 2018-07-20 02:31:44 I noticed that looking at $BIDU weekly chart & $NVDA chart too. $NVDA was half way to  highs so it was kinda 50/50 it’d go up or down (chart favored upside). So I opened a 3 week bidu short position for $1.50. Incase $NVDA failed but I just saw a pic China stocks doing well 
4169 2018-07-20 02:30:29 Great job working to get something banned that’s completely useless & only used in less than 1% of all shootings. Last time I checked handguns are used in most shootings so banning bump stocks does nothing. After all your pointless ramblings you still know nothing about guns.

4189 2018-07-20 02:26:40 violating cost basis of your investment cost = chasing and undisciplined investing.  You buy on the way down and only buy stocks that lower your cost basis in that share and let stocks that go up ride rather than chasing.  It keeps you from buying into a crash. #discipline

4200 2018-07-20 02:18:31 Is that like when they pledged to pass on tax savings to employees but then they bought their own stocks instead?
4201 2018-07-20 02:17:51 In cycles past, the whole sector would have rolled over by now.  What is keeping most of the stocks from doing that at this stage?

4203 2018-07-20 02:16:31 $SPX monthly options expire on the open. So if any PLAYERS still in there with short puts, there will be a program to bring it back fast before the open. As long as the stocks themselves aren't hit, as it is settled by $SET not the $SPX actual open.

4207 2018-07-20 02:13:54 My exact point.People do not know how net worth works. Its not like they go to the bank and cash out all of that money. In order for him to get that money he'd have to sell all of his Amazon stocks which would in turn lower the actual price of Amazon which would lower their worth

4217 2018-07-20 02:04:46 It doesn't take much to realize 58 people were shot and killed by a man with bump stocks and an arsenal of weapons in Vegas. No private citizen needs that much firepower. It's ridiculous.
4218 2018-07-20 02:04:13 But the diet did cause a bit more dive bombing the momager the first couple days till we got used to it. & we just changed which nuts. Tbh momager had a freezer full of pecans to get rid of (she stocks up on our supplies during sales) so we got spoiled a bit.
4219 2018-07-20 02:03:19 As anyone who follows stocks knows, analysts talk down stocks all the time to serve their clients. Their analysis is self-serving. Not that there’s anything particularly wrong with that, but context and motivations are important factors to evaluate their comments.

4225 2018-07-20 01:57:25 Bad for stocks though. Stocks are used to combat and outpace the effects of inflation. Dollar supply and demand can't always drive price up forver and as society grows need more in circulation so they print more and more and devalue it.
4226 2018-07-20 01:56:26 All I ever hear on TV ads is how gold has made people $$.  I have seen so many people get absolutely destroyed in gold stocks. Thank God I was smart enough to avoid that hot mess.

4244 2018-07-20 01:46:27 Makes no sense to most of us. It's a "negative feedback loop". Global X sells large volumes of #uranium stocks it holds, pushing down share prices so investors see as signal to sell shares of $URA, which hastens selling by Global X, pushing down share prices, and on & on.

4270 2018-07-20 01:22:10 That’s what she wants you to think. She is too conflicted to help Americans get better healthcare, because she has 45 percent of her net worth tied up in Medical Device stocks. She also introduced a bill that will destroy Minnesota’s waterways and pollute our beautiful state.
4271 2018-07-20 01:21:34 One thing you should look into when buying stocks is how much debt the company is in. That plays a major role in its Quarterly earnings and revenue.
4272 2018-07-20 01:21:06 Oil, Gas, and Coal are all down this week BUT Energy stocks are being bought today and the Energy sector is at the top of the list of buying with Property, Healthcare, and Technology (all Defensive Sectors) - makes you think!
4273 2018-07-20 01:19:04 To be fair, CNN has had 3 people resign due to false facts about the President, ABC caused stocks to plummet with a false report on Flynn. You don't seem to cover all these facts that the #FakeNews media is actually a thing. I won't watch CNN anymore. Just garbo!
4274 2018-07-20 01:18:27 The core of investing business is 'the behavior' rest all is stocks allocations etc. Most focus more on the rest than the core.

4276 2018-07-20 01:16:44 There are no zero-bound events in a world that includes QE up to and including buying mortgages and (in Europe) corporate bonds, and (in Japan) frickin' stocks as well.
4277 2018-07-20 01:15:42 Words have little effect. How about a mock execution? Put him naked in stocks in the town square? Take all his perks away and have him live on Food Stamps and live in a Motel 6?
4278 2018-07-20 01:15:16 how are bump stocks not banned yet?
4279 2018-07-20 01:14:15 whelp..spoke too soon, already plenty of plans for 3D printed bump-stocks out there. Hoggy's attempt at a ban is about shit now.
4280 2018-07-20 01:13:48 We need them to pump these stocks up though.

4285 2018-07-20 01:12:11 you'll probably find the plans up on DD pretty soon anyways, that being said..dont even need a bumpstock so it's really a non-issue. banning bump stocks a total waste of time, i guess they need to feel like they are accomplishing something.

4288 2018-07-20 01:10:38 Hopefully this is the presidence that they need to block the bump stock ban. I believe this law had some wording about bump stocks in it as well.
4289 2018-07-20 01:10:18 Be strong Mr.President. When CNN finally sinks even below the cartoon channel and loses all stocks. Buy the network. Rename it to W.I.N News Network. May I also suggest you buy Twitter and call it Trumper. Twitter nasty practices won't last long.

4339 2018-07-20 00:16:50 Investing is the way to financial independence. Best thing you can do is buy a few stocks and see how it goes. I suggest getting index fund like SPY (tracks entire S&P 500) or VTI (Total Stock Market fund). I like playing the individual names, but as long as you put money in!

4348 2018-07-20 00:07:42 But comparisons with 2014 means there has been no growth in last 4 years. The economy has been growing so is the companies. If this comparison is true then stocks should never go up be it short term or long term
