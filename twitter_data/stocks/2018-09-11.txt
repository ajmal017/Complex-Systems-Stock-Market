11 2018-09-11 23:47:23 Well... I’m a thousandaire.. I’m currently up 20% over the last year. I missed a few big stocks that should’ve invested more in though
12 2018-09-11 23:47:07 They all want to get assets.  So they change products to maximize flows.  Once gold stocks return multiples of the spx you’ll see gold funds open.  Then you can sell and buy what’s contrarian or of value at that time.
13 2018-09-11 23:45:31 Although Bitcoin is volatile, I think it has a lower risk profile than any other asset out there.

Bonds? Inflation risk.
Real estate? Litigation risk/Price controls.
Stocks? Low ROI/Judgment vulnerable.

I could easily see bitcoin as the "risk free" asset of the future.
14 2018-09-11 23:45:06 Yes that is wrong.  They did it because it’s already under performed.   Classic mutual fund thought process.  Backward bias.  They did the same thing in 2000/01 before gold and related stocks ripped.  A contrarian bullish thing and temporary supply demand impact that’s done.
15 2018-09-11 23:43:43 apple stocks rise by 20%.
16 2018-09-11 23:43:31 Stocks are a long game and I’m sure investors were ready to buy when the price dropped. Nonetheless, they’ve forever tainted their brand for a number of people.
17 2018-09-11 23:42:41 I'm not sure they should either. It's the damage the other CB's are doing to the pension world. Look at Chicago.  They want to borrow what 10 B and pile into stocks. 
Where does that lead? 
It's the ECB that's totally out of line right now. 
I think they lose control, one day.

41 2018-09-11 23:38:54 More low wage jobs, How is it no ISIS when they recently attacked and killed some of our men, there are still wars around the world, stocks are not a measure how we are doing, only how the rich are doing. Trump has done nothing but attack our democracy and rule of law #msnbc

50 2018-09-11 23:33:38 Stocks are really hard, because the folks that tell everyone to invest have a lot of moolah to invest, and a lot of us are like “umm, I bought 2 shares” and then under breath “-oh gosh what have I done-”
51 2018-09-11 23:31:33 I try to encourage all my friends and family to invest in stocks. I tell them it's really the only way to amass real wealth for the average person.

58 2018-09-11 23:25:05 Nike seems to be doing pretty well right now, stocks and revenue. I don't understand how a person could be so against Nike's new ad, but at the same time support Trump who is on record demeaning women and veterans. Two things you seem to be very vocal about.
59 2018-09-11 23:24:23 I’ve never been into buy stocks but @AMD is really tempting to jump into.
60 2018-09-11 23:23:58 Total BS. He was on the crapper checking his stocks, and on twitter.

68 2018-09-11 23:20:32 European stocks were mixed on Tuesday as the trade dispute between Washington and Beijing weighed on the market and investors eyed China's demand for sanctions on the US from the World Trade Organisation.

Don't stop believing on those stocks
70 2018-09-11 23:19:19 energy stocks were boosted by a higher crude price as @Halliburton jumped 1.8%, @exxonmobil rose 1.4%, @Chevron and @ConocoPhillips gained 0.5%, and @Occidental firmed 0.3%.

72 2018-09-11 23:18:17 Technology stocks were notable gainers as @Apple jumped 2.5%, a day ahead of a highly anticipated event in which the company is expected to unveil new iPhone models and could also announce upgrades to other products
73 2018-09-11 23:18:14 We know how eager you are to get your hands on the OnePlus Bullets Wireless, Amar. However, we do not have any news to share at the moment. You may select "Notify Me" on the order page to receive an email once stocks are available. Thanks for your patience.
74 2018-09-11 23:17:58 US stocks shrugged off a subdued start to close higher on Tuesday, as Apple led a jump in technology stocks and a rise in oil prices lifted energy companies.
75 2018-09-11 23:16:00 I had my retirement stash invested in stocks. I lost a ton of money when Obama was running his show. I moved my money into cash reserves. Figured it would be better to make no money than to lose it.  I’m back in the stock market and making money. Thank you, Mr. Trump.

78 2018-09-11 23:09:13 @1simpletrader Hi, i just wanted to ask as a fellow Canadian, what is best/suitable platform to trade stocks/commodities. As per my knowledge OANDA is for forex only right? BTW love your charts. Keep coming those memes as well 
79 2018-09-11 23:08:14 US stocks rose as Apple led a jump in technology shares and a gain of more than 2 per cent in oil prices drove up energy shares. A recovery in European shares stalled as a trade dispute between Washington and Beijing weighed on the market. Hong Kong shares fell into bear market.

87 2018-09-11 23:01:30 Although, tbh I spent today being hit by wave after wave of dysphoria because no high street store stocks sizes small enough for me.
88 2018-09-11 23:01:16 I see some mmj stocks after legalization will sell off . But there is one in particular that should already  have a 100m market cap and hasent even started yet . Fun times coming . Could be a replay of 2017 but this time as myself hope I am a little smarter
89 2018-09-11 23:01:08 @Gktrader2000 sorry I didnt mean to be rude. Im just as frustrated as the next guy of good fundamental stocks dropping on lack of catalysts
90 2018-09-11 23:01:02 My stocks have doubled this year thanks to Trump and I owe less tax at the end of this year. These liberal owned newspapers are crumbling under the weight of their own corruption

93 2018-09-11 22:59:52 $FB $AMD Which of these two stocks will rise 30% first?
94 2018-09-11 22:59:48 US stocks have risen with Apple leading a jump in technology shares as a gain of more than two per cent in oil prices drove up energy shares. 

Apple rose 2.5 per cent on Tuesday, boosting the three major indexes, a day ahead of its expected unveiling of new iPhone models.
95 2018-09-11 22:58:47 Feds should put him in stocks and whip him until he tells the truth. Not Corporal, but Sargent Major punishment. Water boarding is too severe!

105 2018-09-11 22:52:57 Net worth, or how do my stocks do?
106 2018-09-11 22:52:39 Je ne comprendrais jamais ces chtarbès qui, en prévision d'une potentielle guerre nucléaire, investissent dans des bunkers avec d'impressionnat stocks de vivres alors qu'ils peuvent s'abonner gratuitement à la chaîne YouTube '' primitive technology ''.
107 2018-09-11 22:52:26 Do you offer any training on how you pick the stocks to trade?
108 2018-09-11 22:50:33 I flag dodgy companies to highlight to retail you best do your own due diligence & don't believe the sales pitch.
Same here.
Clients of insurance products need to do own DD, Caveat Emperor & all that.
It doesn't mean you don't invest in stocks or buy insurance.
Remain cynical
109 2018-09-11 22:50:05 Yea...nobody was laughing at UT's coaching search.  If anyone knows laughing stocks, it is UT!
110 2018-09-11 22:50:01 So you care and 5,369 other people really care that Egypt may start 4 RXs in 8 years from today?  I dont think so.  We know there will be builds but who will be holding U stocks from here in 8 years?  Not me. I care about demand from now until 24 months down the road....maybe.
111 2018-09-11 22:49:54 but go ahead in your money its stocks they also go up and will never go down
112 2018-09-11 22:49:41 My stocks doing gr8
113 2018-09-11 22:49:28 Jim what’s your % odds that human beings still price stocks in 2023?
114 2018-09-11 22:48:30 Best part is y’all are laughing stocks of college football. Nobody gives a damn. Please keep it up. It’s entertaining.
115 2018-09-11 22:47:03 That doesn't mean anything. After a huge drop in stock, of course people are going to buy. Only way to make money in stocks is to buy cheap and sell high. Don't forget they lost over 4 billion in stocks. If they only have 75% of that back that's still a significant hit.
116 2018-09-11 22:46:11 Sounds like it's worth a try. But why FX over stocks, commodities...?
117 2018-09-11 22:45:48 @WebullGlobal it's pretty discriminatory to prevent app user's from buying penny stocks from and open stock market.
118 2018-09-11 22:45:43 Haha, that's Yahoo Finance website. I haven't found an equivalent with free real-time update of my stocks.

126 2018-09-11 22:40:35 I'm still holding most of my HD position. Being in the middle of hurricane season, I figured it was a safe bet. I'm also holding some AAPL options, since the profits from what I sold today makes it a free trade. I like to use options that way when stocks run up before an event.
127 2018-09-11 22:40:28 Dude 1v1 me 4 stocks final destination no items
128 2018-09-11 22:39:51 AMD stocks went from 2 per share to 30 per share why didn't I bought AMD .....
129 2018-09-11 22:39:50 This could affevt share prices in aviation related stocks? Why doesn't UK HMG ask for an extension now...
130 2018-09-11 22:39:10 Hope all these F'ers and their families not accepting any of the new job openings, accepting any of the interest/money from stocks and not accepting any money from new tax bill (file the old way).
131 2018-09-11 22:36:07 Chinese stocks market plunge so many days.dead end.
132 2018-09-11 22:34:24 Why try and force a trade on $BTC or some $Alt that's been going down for 90% of the year when there are so many opportunities in other markets?

FX, Stocks, Commodities all have better platforms, defined trading time, more pairs and leverage the list goes on.

Educate yourself!

Michael Joblin has had an unhealthy obsession with stockswami ever since I have proved him wrong over so many stocks.
For Michael, I suggest he move on for his own health.
140 2018-09-11 22:30:19 You can't "protect your savings with 1% rates for decades longer.  99% of Americans can't retire cause you have to burn thru capital every month just to pay bills but stocks and most other assets are at all-time highs. Makes no sense to still have rates at "emergency levels"
141 2018-09-11 22:29:16 Unnamed sources tells me you’re delusional and part of the Socialists movement and want a national party

149 2018-09-11 22:24:19 About to really start investing more. Less investing into people more investing in stocks
150 2018-09-11 22:23:10 #GFRD results tomorrow. Forward Divvy 7.6% and Fwd p/e 6.8 - certainly not expensive although Housing / Construction stocks are lowly rated at moment.
151 2018-09-11 22:22:47 You Joe, You one stupid idiot. EVERY economic metric is up since the election: more employed, more take-home $, Investment $s, IRAs, Pensions, stocks and bonds, the dollar, consumer confidence and most importantly OPPORTUNITY!
152 2018-09-11 22:22:18 American tech stocks have been gold going on a decade.  Why on earth would anyone invest in Silver or care what it does?  

No response needed:)   

And thanks for the tweet!!  I have not checked the price of silver in a decade probably:)
153 2018-09-11 22:21:29 $INPX: Just like we alerted $ANY $XSPA $RHE-- $INPX should spike over $0.20+ on this penny mania . ..  possibly tomorrow during PM. $0.126 average and holding 100%.

156 2018-09-11 22:19:20 I need to learn so much more about investing in Stocks
157 2018-09-11 22:17:00 The idea is to slowly appropriate wealth from the very richest members of society through inheritance taxes, land appropriation, buying of stocks to slowly gain ownership of companies. That’s not a revolution, jackass.
158 2018-09-11 22:16:54 How are they able to avoid tax liability? You are required to pay taxes on all gains from your positions, just like stocks.
159 2018-09-11 22:16:51 @Tesla stocks plunged after @elonmusk smoked a joint on @joerogan’s podcast. What the hell do investors think people are going to be doing in their car, while its driving itself? It’s honestly the only reason to own a Tesla.
160 2018-09-11 22:16:46 In the big picture, I really don't care.  I assume they will ship pallets of cash to their lobbyists and play the pretend game and all will be fine.
On $NDX I have short strangles so just stay in range for the rest of the year is fine with me.  No position on individual stocks

171 2018-09-11 22:12:49 DEALINGS SHOULD BE IN THE ACTIVE STOCKS.
172 2018-09-11 22:11:36 Everything is debatable. Obama took office after stocks had already plunged, whereas Trump entered the White House when stocks were already at or near all-time highs.
173 2018-09-11 22:11:10 You’ve reminded me...I need to replenish my pastizzi stocks!

175 2018-09-11 22:09:52 J’ai pas d’info l’ami, mais j’imagine que ça approcherait les 150€ minimum, voire un peu plus. Toutefois, les stocks seront très probablement en rupture rapidement, ça va se vendre comme des petits pains.

181 2018-09-11 22:02:35 hey, @jimcramer whats your advice on @HIGH_TIMES_Mag going public?is print a dying art or could it be a diamond in the rough? #madmoney cannabis stocks have been soaring can high times capitalize on that surge?
182 2018-09-11 22:01:51 I did not gauge the Robotic Reinforcement of Trend that stocks have had. So I’m missing the upside. But if the downside has the same phenomenon then I’ll make a killing. We shouldn’t have a panic low that crushes specs but a punishing one that hurts investors.
183 2018-09-11 22:01:28 I'd really appreciate the token. It would really help in getting me new stocks and sorting a few other things out. Thank You.

189 2018-09-11 21:57:22 Where did you learn economy? on an infomercial on TV? If US Companies are using their cash to buy their own stocks, it is because they think they are cheap, so they expect that their future profit will increase much more thanks to an improving economy!
190 2018-09-11 21:57:12 I must confess it is terribly remiss of me to allow the marmite stocks to reach such a critically low level. You have my assurances that I will rectify the situation forthwith and ensure a spare jar is purchased to prevent re-occurrence.

200 2018-09-11 21:46:01 Oh dear. That seems to be a great contrarian indicator. Once the squeeze higher in stocks in the US ends, the deleveraging of China's debt binge following the GFC, will see deflationary forces return, and a turn in the above chart
201 2018-09-11 21:45:10 The Passive Bubble will end in 1 of 2 ways Fear (most likely) or Baby Boomers dying and their kids selling stocks to buy new "experiences" (also, most likely)
202 2018-09-11 21:44:27 Well, I mean people still had to go out and buy the Nike merch so that they could burn it live on Youtube. So, of course stocks are going to go up.

234 2018-09-11 21:29:54 You really don’t know your history do you. Power cuts were because of COAL stocks running low due to Miners industrial action! The 3 day week was to preserve coal stocks so that energy was available for critical services! Oil shock was in 73, power cuts were occurring from 1970!
235 2018-09-11 21:27:57 You can't beat the market, right?

Last month I put together a mock single stock portfolio with 10 stocks.

Over the last month it slightly outperformed the S&P 500 (2.76% vs 2.34%).

Think I'll keep going for a year or so, and if I win, I'll buy stocks.

Thoughts?

And maybe a small recession by 2020. 

Central banks will still do whatever it takes to prevent a deflation, based on recent comments (QE, buy stocks)

247 2018-09-11 21:22:25 Well done - these stocks scare the shit out of me - one day hopefully !!!
248 2018-09-11 21:22:19 The CAPM assumes companies are valued based on a LT (say 10 years) cash flow forecast discounted at an appropriate cost of capital. If we're in the 7th inning then why are stocks priced to perfection? Because corporate finance theory is horseshit in a Fed-backed market.
249 2018-09-11 21:22:11 He’s a bond guy that gets stocks right once in a blue moon. But always interesting to hear
250 2018-09-11 21:21:59 Dalio and Gundlach both take a leak on the bull market parade, stocks close higher.  Trade carefully!
251 2018-09-11 21:19:48 Yes only an idiot would start a miners strike in Spring with coal stocks reaching the sky. That is the sad truth, it was almost criminal.
252 2018-09-11 21:19:23 Only if they are not registered with SEC.  like this guy. He lied.  Doesn’t have much to do with an ICO.  They stocks man. Have to register.  IMHO.  When USDT blowing up?  Haaaa.

256 2018-09-11 21:17:39 Well now, the sale of arms is another area where we are not exactly doing our bit for world peace - god knows how many thousands have been killed in Yemen with British made weaponry sold to the Saudis. Not much to do with preserving fish stocks but its a pretty grim spectre
257 2018-09-11 21:17:23 You think like me, why hold when you can sell for profit & protect your investment, have stop losses in place, if it drops & you still like the stock then get back in at lower prices, it took some stocks several years to recover from that crash, who wants to hold a bag for years.
258 2018-09-11 21:16:10 There is an idea of a bear market, some kind of abstraction but there is no real selloff, only a dip, something illusory. And though it can hide the deteriorating breadth and you can BTFD the FANG stocks and still book profits, the bear is simply not there.
259 2018-09-11 21:15:45 No one but @TrueGeordieTG would that happen to

269 2018-09-11 21:11:30 I get it. You hate seeing people you don't like prospering or having a strong nation. You would prefer us to be some second world nation, weakened and irrelevant. You had your chance with Obama but all he did was kill Americans and hand out food stamps.

273 2018-09-11 21:08:09 3) We need to do deals that benefit us in addition to our partners. Not one sided ones. I got Canadian dairy farmers fighting tooth and nail not to redo NAFTA because they don't want to compete with our dairy farmers.

276 2018-09-11 21:07:07 2) Thinking they are owed $15/hr while continuing to mess up the simple concept of bun/meat/bun. Blue collar jobs are thin across the board in all trades. We became a service economy with a massive gap between skilled and unskilled labor.

281 2018-09-11 21:05:58 1) Clueless is thinking NAFTA benefited our country and workers when in reality it didn't. It basically propped up Mexico's Narco State. We lost a giant chunk of manufacturing. That's jobs lost. Towns gone. What do we have today? A bunch of unskilled burger flippers
282 2018-09-11 21:05:48 Being right or wrong is often just a matter of timing - especially with AIM stocks. There have been plenty where I haven’t liked the story but they’ve gained lots of momentum, only to ultimately be proven correct. We all get some badly wrong though

287 2018-09-11 21:04:23 Yes I did. Socialism is a theory. True socialism is impossible. Equal distribution only works if every member of society is willing 2 share everything equally regardless of education/income. Human nature/greed will never comply. Government then steps in 2 force the distribution.

As for how many stocks well that’s down to choice / research and for me the key is managing risk across a number of stocks

359 2018-09-11 20:35:22 So important for everything we care about. Long-term investments (& divestments From #FossilFuel) in #GreenEnergy, such as #SolarHydroWind, stocks/funds, are key strategies to helping mitigate the worsening effects of #ClimateChange—some of which we’re already experiencing.

Academic research has shown that stocks close to their 52 week highs tend to outperform. This is apparently because investors use the 52- week high as an "anchor" against which they value stocks, thus they tend to be reluctant to buy

363 2018-09-11 20:33:04 Nice one. Still, there is cause for concern about ETFs nosing into smallish stocks that can’t support the trading that might happen in the ETF, no? Not saying it’s a systemic risk but some investors might get burned

372 2018-09-11 20:29:45 Stocks are fun. AMD stocks is around $30, continuously growing. Intel around $45, flat lining for ages. And there is Nvidia around $270, a case on itself.
And I invested my time and money in my own company.
373 2018-09-11 20:29:33 That's great to hear!  Thanks for the heads-up when I start messing around with it.  It will save me some time.  Did you just trade FX or do you still trade common stocks as well?
374 2018-09-11 20:28:25 Thanks to Trump my wages have double, making more in my stocks and my wife and I are planning on a new home soon.
375 2018-09-11 20:27:28 Shia labeouf said ‘money never sleeps’ so with that fire wisdom in mind I went to the bank today to see if anyone wanted to trade stocks but for some reason couldnt get any takers lmao I had good AgroFresh stock I wanted to make liquid so sux for those losers who didnt trade
376 2018-09-11 20:27:10 The volume, you would see massive selling taking place and the bids not holding up this is where time and hours of watching stocks move come into play no one can teach you that but if you  take a trade off one of support levels and it fails cut losses quickly always have a plan

386 2018-09-11 20:24:41 I still do not trust today's rally... It is mostly NQ driven (Probably $NYFANG stocks).  Something again did not feel right but well we will wait & watch.  That being said, i will personally keep both bias in mind with slight weight to buyers considering today's rally.
387 2018-09-11 20:24:34 Had to cut off some of my i investor friends during the week because they would talk bout stocks and tell me the next boom listened and payed it the hard way. This is like a business and it's your paper on the line

395 2018-09-11 20:18:45 Business is booming for the corporations which used the tax breaks to buy back their own stocks and boost their earnings. Very little got down to small business or the working stiffs.  You believe your on PR, which is the mark of a putz.

401 2018-09-11 20:15:53 This is the counterpoint to “fico scores are broken”.  Fico works really well for credit delivery.  There is a big range on unsecured borrowing rates - from 5.5% up to 36%.  Borrowing against crypto will be priced like borrowing against stocks over time.
402 2018-09-11 20:15:50 Stocks end higher as tech shares rebound
403 2018-09-11 20:15:46 China’s stock market is down 10% year to date. But if you go from the 2018 recent highs, Chinese stocks are down OVER 24%... meaning they are in a full-fledged bear market.
404 2018-09-11 20:15:28 Yes and no... you can buy and sell the contracts like stocks but they function differently and represent the right to buy or sell 100 shares of a specific stock on a specific date.. being that they expire, time is a factor in the pricing and its way more volatile
405 2018-09-11 20:15:22 The Fed has burst the Everything Bubble. While US stocks have continued to move higher courtesy of capital flowing into the US as a result of the Fed’s policies, the rest of the world is entering a meltdown.

407 2018-09-11 20:14:49 What is wrong with investors?  I guarantee you the demographic the #BoycottNike company isn't buying their stocks so I'm guessing it's rich white people.  STOP!! They need to know it's not right. STAND FOR SOMETHING!

410 2018-09-11 20:12:24 Is it easy to find Kirby cucumbers outside of seasonal? As someone who lacto-ferments hers, I would absolutely try this. But my grocery store only stocks the basic cucumbers. Maybe I’ll do a vat when they show up at the farmer’s market next summer.

424 2018-09-11 20:07:56 Because it’s crypto not stocks and shares. Crypto is for the masses not just the middle and upper crust. It’s also world wide without boundaries or much control. Big difference.

427 2018-09-11 20:06:43 $1M advice here.  Apply the law of compounding interest to crypto, and you will be able to retire at 50.  Just buy a little Bitcoin with every paycheck like how that Coke lady buys $100 of Coke stocks a month for 20 years straight and had $10M when she retired.

438 2018-09-11 20:02:12 I stepped out of stocks in June. No use sitting on stocks over summer, especially this year with no value left.
439 2018-09-11 20:01:34 Stock is a cost. So both mainstream production lines, sub-stream production lines, buffers and resilient contingency stocks are all kept to a minimum. Amongst others, this means a firm will need to run routine and ad hoc stock replenishment in order to ensure output.

493 2018-09-11 19:40:46 I just came home from the clubs.. It was a long Friday.. I had maybe one brain cell left working... (Snorted the rest of them) And as every morning.. I watched business news and stocks.. I watched the entire event unfold live.. Living downtown SF..

495 2018-09-11 19:39:51 stocks will rotate with action   when say amzn , aapl run up then level off ... nvda had a $ 44 run  up back down to .618 fibo area retrace  .. has  been sideways  for last week 271-277 range,,, I call this marking time for a big move.... if  you have small account stay away
496 2018-09-11 19:39:46 What's wrong w/ NQ? Fruit and Jeff are up big, so is HouseOfCardsFlix, Mr. Softee, so why isn't NQ up more? They need to dump those pesky tiny cap tech stocks.
497 2018-09-11 19:39:38 I looked into many of the major stocks Trump and supporters have boycotted from the date they boycotted them until present. Up 495% or $1,460 in share prices. Nike will be fine.
498 2018-09-11 19:38:55 The guy who is building the 15,000 square-foot mansion who made the money in penny stocks in the 1980s and then laundered it through Bermuda to avoid full tax, he can lose his whole damn state I don’t give a fuck. He can live in a small house.
499 2018-09-11 19:38:35 Rinse and repeat??? Agree, but I've succeeded by sticking to two or three stocks and RR them. Trends the friend. Playing too many stocks stops one living a life off the comp screen. I'm living in Asia, Spend 1 hour a day trading my 3 stocks.
500 2018-09-11 19:38:05 forex or just stocks and bonds
501 2018-09-11 19:37:53 Why are NIKE stocks up?
502 2018-09-11 19:37:46 hard question to answer, all I'll say is if you trade stocks that are 2x more volatile than SPX and you're not generating 2x more return you're doing it wrong.
503 2018-09-11 19:37:26 If you haven’t yet, you better buy some nike stocks !!
504 2018-09-11 19:37:23 I've been trading more stocks lately than crypto, good shit

505 2018-09-11 19:37:11 Why was buying during that crash a bad idea? Presuming you selected quality stocks to buy and that you were able to buy them cheaper during the crash than before the crash.
506 2018-09-11 19:37:10 Behind fake pres' desk in oval sits what looks like starbucks single coffee thingies....yeah....he's promoting starbucks....check his stocks...

518 2018-09-11 19:32:27 To make matter worse for us staying, the stores had run out of water and other supplies on Sunday. SUNDAY. A few stores had stocks shipped in since then, but people have bought them all out. There is not a single place in my city to buy water or a generator. #HurricaneFlorence
519 2018-09-11 19:32:09 unless a worker has invested in stocks the past decade, there has been no lift out of the recession. i understand why dummy donald can't figure that out, but why are the economists who know these things so silent? america is great if you are a shareholder
520 2018-09-11 19:30:14 Hey! As long as stocks last. We are unlikely to re stock items from collections. Thanks 
521 2018-09-11 19:28:28 Heard a business reporter on the radio talking about the impact of an approaching hurricane on stocks. It’s sick that people are gambling on this storm to make a buck.

536 2018-09-11 19:17:20 I honestly don't want to take away your tax cut. I don't think millionaires and billionaires need them. I don't think we need to take lunches away from poor kids so the rich can buy back their own stocks.

573 2018-09-11 19:01:40 Really?!? All those big businesses are buying back stocks & not giving raises, but you keep believing it!!

574 2018-09-11 19:01:22 Lots of r people pumping crappy stocks saying “Money event. overflows (or has to turn) to smaller caps”, “XYZ has hit bottom, the only way from here is up!”, etc. That could be true but let it be known for newbies, “you will be entering into a deadly (liquidity) trap” #Potstocks

580 2018-09-11 18:58:45 From what I've seen most bears are jerks. Not people who short stocks. People who actually identify as bears.
581 2018-09-11 18:58:12 Me too, though stocks never last more than a week.
582 2018-09-11 18:56:58 It’s just for bragging rights. These guys have been going at it, getting personal so thought this would be a way to get it back to stocks. Whatever they both agreed to it and it’s happening.
583 2018-09-11 18:56:45 yes it is a very profitable day but the price action in stocks across the board does not give me a warm and fuzzy feeling about this mkt. will go heavy cash into the close
584 2018-09-11 18:56:08 You can thank Obama for bringing us out of Bush's recession and on the right path for jobs and economic recovery. Stocks are higher bc BIG BUSINESSES love a GOP prez who will give them free money via tax cuts. Tax cut isn't a GOOD thing. Wages are declining.

587 2018-09-11 18:54:54 Second, you always have to ask if an event fundamentally changes the economic outlook. The recovery after the financial crisis was fast and steady because of all the liquidity the Fed pumped in. From the 68 peak to the beg of new bull market in 82,  both stocks and bonds-AWFUL
588 2018-09-11 18:54:18 Nobody in this world can time the market.  The traders will get a few solid good trades, but they will get caught.  Just apply the Warren Buffet investing strategy to crypto and pick solid coins and hold long term. IMO, BTC will outperform the best stocks in the next 5 years.
589 2018-09-11 18:54:05 No dude. I’m just frustrated with guys who can’t pick up a simple concept. PBay and Joe agreed to this. They could pick any 3 stocks. They did. They allowed the others to pick them. So your opinion is practically irrelevant

592 2018-09-11 18:52:58 The first rule should be to run away from any Guru proposing new traders trade penny stocks. This game is tough enough then to dip your toes in such risk stocks. I dont care whether it is short or long, it is huge gamble IMHO
593 2018-09-11 18:52:40 Why not sell ur pf stocks when u see froth in the mkt & just purchase more of them with same money when the mkt eventually cools down.. mkt timing is an art in itself.
594 2018-09-11 18:51:41 $NLST 0.49 (-34%) everyone knew this was coming no!
595 2018-09-11 18:51:31 One should always get rid of things you do not think have an upside after the bottom. Too many people hold stocks that are x-growth because they do not to pay capital gains.  If you don’t have cash you won’t be able to buy at the bottom. Sell at bottom? Most people won’t.

599 2018-09-11 18:49:42 This got very little publicity - instead CNBC decided to focus on Ray Dalio saying we are in the 7th inning of an expansion (which really only started in 2016 IMO) and that investors need to be defensive with upside limited for stocks

601 2018-09-11 18:47:58 are you paid by the street and bankers? Nyse dumped all stocks to go crypto for $1800. Tell it to dumb people. Call me when 1800 i will get a large bag
602 2018-09-11 18:47:55 Stocks and sales are up.
603 2018-09-11 18:47:21 Well particularly as the market dismissed ALL of the other partnerships announced in the last 3-4 months (Xiaomi, inmobi, Gold's Gym, etc). It's one of the most undervalued upside stocks out there. That said, it'd be nice to see actual revenue growth show up on the balance sheet.
604 2018-09-11 18:46:17 When he ran for President, Mitt Romney told everyone he paid 14% in taxes. That should have been a scandal!!! That’s less than the middle class pay. The perfect tax plan is a 21% tax on everyone, on ALL income over $24,000, including income the rich roll back into their stocks.

607 2018-09-11 18:45:10 (1/2) The model I like to sort of simplify the notion of what goes o­n in a market for common stocks is the pari-mutuel system at the racetrack... a pari-mutuel system is a market. Everybody goes there and bets and the odds change based o­n what's bet.

609 2018-09-11 18:44:00 Hey @JohnCornyn...
1. Only 50% of US own stocks
2. The top 10% of wealth holders in the US own 85-90% of stocks
3. African Americans are less likely to invest than their white peers
4. CEOs, flush with stock options, are making out like bandits, with income up 72% since ‘09

619 2018-09-11 18:35:13 I think we have just scratched the surface on where these stocks go. After M&A & open regulators etc. I really think these stocks have triple digit gains ahead. The acceptance of using has become so mainstream it’s uncanny.

632 2018-09-11 18:29:27 wages for middle-class families are falling and more than 90 percent of stocks are owned by the richest 20 percent of households.

633 2018-09-11 18:29:05 Tech, energy stocks lift Wall Street: U.S. stocks powered higher on Tuesday, shaking off a subdued start, as Apple led a jump in technology stocks and a rise in oil prices lifted energy companies.
634 2018-09-11 18:28:41 It’s all good !! They will suffer slowly !! After they were scared out of their wits their supporters saved them by buying away but it won’t last forever. Their stocks bounced back but let’s revisit this a year or two down the road. Real Patriots won’t forget.

655 2018-09-11 18:19:56 Why give them a tax cut then? They don't need it.  The income divide becomes greater. Lower income people spend the tax break and stimulate the economy. The rich buy more stocks just like corporations buy back stock. Someday soon, there will be a reckoning.

683 2018-09-11 18:01:19 Literally no one said you shouldn't comment on the Nike stock. Stop.

Literally everyone pointed out you were an idiot for reacting like that in less than 24 hours. Also posting without any context (i.e. all sports apparel company's stocks - other than Under Armour - were down).
684 2018-09-11 18:00:54 Guess what, everyone? The real Kompromat is that Russia gave trump info (via Saudis) pre-9/11 that allowed him to buy/sell specific real estate/stocks. Rather than warn anyone about the terrorist plot, he used to info that make a fortune. #truth
685 2018-09-11 18:00:50 Again, this is just looking at the numbers. But even his most unflattering numbers suggest, with the limited batting stocks we have, Maxwell, not at his best, forced to chop and change where he's batting, is better than the batsmen we pick alongside him / to choose from now.
686 2018-09-11 18:00:46 No problem. Please advise relevant stocks and I will try my best

727 2018-09-11 17:44:32 All investments have a rate of return, which is *not* to be confused with an interest rate. One can invest in productive assets (stocks) or non-productive assets (gold, currencies). Fiat is an asset with negative rate of return over the long term, due to its inflationary nature.

731 2018-09-11 17:41:50 The larger picture is that of higher rates and increasing inflation. Stocks and property would fall. CB action will ensue, but how and when? I agree with Spec Thor in short run,but then? Gold is a cure against foolish management, and fools abound. I`v opted for Glint-pay shares.
732 2018-09-11 17:41:40 Difficile. Le prix (souvent le plus bas), la fiabilité de l'état des stocks et du délai de livraison (Goliath terrifiant de ce côté-là) et l'aisance abusive concernant les retours éventuels (étiquette à imprimer en deux clics, remboursement AVANT retour du produit).

736 2018-09-11 17:38:48 So for some stocks you can invest in fractional shares and you don’t have to shell out the full price. But tech stock is really good in the sense that having a “smart home” is super big right now. So like Apple, Microsoft, and Samsung (other lesser known too)

WHERE ARE THEY?
739 2018-09-11 17:37:29 I think this is mainly an ego thing. Luxury houses are sexy. It's like VC. Some folks think warehouses or net-net stocks are beneath them (or they don't have the skills to do it)

1028 2018-09-11 15:45:41 'JIT' is just a manufacturing decision to maximise the bottom line.

1160 2018-09-11 14:45:51 Thanks! As you know, prior to 2004, S&P weighted stocks by market value rather than float. In that regime, large passive inflows disproportionately benefited stocks with high weight/trading volume ratios. NTT in Japan in the 1980s, for instance!

1163 2018-09-11 14:44:40 With lower inventories, in 2018 a normal run fall should put US NGL stocks at dire levels. Most likely raise global prices due to lower exports. Inventories or exports something has to give. NGL golbal demand growth is a bigger story than crude.

1201 2018-09-11 14:31:39 No. For example, the coffee shop owner I frequent talks stocks with me and is sure that whenever his go down, its market manipulation by powerful interests rather than just how the market works. So he wants risk rewards without the risk downside.

- If u can't quantify the edge, u won't have the right bankroll management

It's not like this is catching them off guard.

1418 2018-09-11 13:16:07 Why don’t we lend money for less than the rate of inflation for thirty years to buy stocks? How about eliminating cap gains after a 2yr hold for stocks? Oh and plenty of other stim policy bens. like allowiing people to use there houses as hotels. and we wonder why!

1440 2018-09-11 13:02:28 No one should want to take credit for this. A booming economy? More jobs? Stocks on the rise? No one but the top is benefiting. More jobs = more part-time low paying jobs and people cannot pay rent or hold more than 2 PT jobs due to competing schedules. Stocks - 1% is buying back

1446 2018-09-11 13:00:44 Short sellers can never "force a stock down". The best they can do is present a thesis that convinces long investors to sell, but that rarely works unless it's done publicly. China stocks IMO are mostly down due to deleveraging campaign and fears of leadership vacuum.
1447 2018-09-11 13:00:31 When are you going to set that "Socialist" example? Sell your houses cars boats stocks out of Country investments..clean out your savings bank accounts..pool it all together & start distributing..put YOUR money where your mouth is..or you can just grow your sorryass up..

1463 2018-09-11 12:53:28 True. All I did  was to choose few funds, invested regularly via sip and addl via Lumpsum. Also chose some good stocks and invested for long term. My funds gave me better returns. Managed the asset allocation at all time based on index PE ratio.

I m financially independent now.
1464 2018-09-11 12:53:23 No, that's the problem with investing everything into just one asset. Same with stocks, same with housing. Cryptocurrency is more like a resource like Gold or a stock with all the same risks that come with those

This is why if you're investing money you want a diverse portfolio.
1465 2018-09-11 12:52:01 4) Finally, consider investing - but carefully, and for the v long term (10yr+). Don't dump into stocks without knowing what you're doing and being prepared to lose that money (which is why it's last on my list). But the sooner you have investments, the better. Compound returns
1466 2018-09-11 12:51:38 Yup no doubt but if I put the work in and do whatever it takes I know I'll be able to make a living buying & selling penny stocks

Two counter-points: (1) stocks and bonds can (and have) exhibit very positive correlations and, (2) expected end-of-period loss will be a function of expected return and volatility.

1520 2018-09-11 12:26:17 Do u make profit out of stocks
1521 2018-09-11 12:24:57 It seems that "stocks have kicked off September on the back foot, with the S&P 500 down 0.8% month-to-date and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lower by 2.3%. Trade tensions are in focus once again this morning following reports that Beijing will ask the World Trade"
1522 2018-09-11 12:23:52 The Hong Kong Hang Seng index fell into a bear market on Tuesday, closing 0.7% lower for the day to stand more than 20% below its recent peak in January. A bear market in stocks in mainland China, occurred as of late June.
1523 2018-09-11 12:22:25 I'm not sure this is going to do what you think it will. The addition of corporate bonds to the bond portfolio makes the bonds MORE correlated with the stocks in a drawdown, because credit risk and equity risk are so similar.

1560 2018-09-11 11:59:22 I think a majority of investors can do well if they invest regularly in index funds or any decent mutual fund on a consistent basis. If the investor has some level of interest in stocks, they can identify a few good companies and understand them well over time. - @rohitchauhan

1698 2018-09-11 10:31:59 so in conclusion, trading in FX or stocks doesn't exactly means you are doing that only, and because market across asset classes co relate to one another in one way or the other, you are simply trading the whole market indirectly; which means buying or selling of something

1720 2018-09-11 10:16:31 Yes mate!!! Love these. Looking 
1721 2018-09-11 10:15:58 I don’t short stocks and I haven’t looked at it, but I am 100% sure my portfolio has taken a sizeable hit today, and yet I find days like today more exciting than when markets simply move up 200 points. What a sadistic person I am turning into. Special place in hell reserved 
1722 2018-09-11 10:15:16 It's of course very difficult to know but in general Stocks with little or no Revenue and burning Cash tend to make poor Investments. I think #EVRH has a very interesting idea and good to see some Revenue appearing but long way from really making Money I suspect.

1738 2018-09-11 10:01:49 buddy not sure about that as I am no "expert" in that subject. But there were warning signs all along. If the top performing sectors and stocks trigger sell signal and end up making lower highs in smaller time frame, it is sort of time to get cautious
1739 2018-09-11 10:01:45 Hopes of a UK-EU deal over #Brexit kept the #British pound near five-week highs on Tuesday, helping lighten the mood in Europe even though the ongoing trade dispute between Washington and Beijing kept world stocks trading just off three-week lows.

1747 2018-09-11 09:55:45 More you invest in equities, higher the corpus you will retire with. Just betting on risky stocks won't help grow your corpus.
Instead a portfolio of good quality stocks gives courage to commit more money to equity.

11 September 2018
South African markets closed in the red yesterday, amid broad based losses in platinum and retail sector stocks. 66 stocks closed higher, 171 closed lower and 187 were unchanged.
What to watch today
1882 2018-09-11 07:32:21 Please tell us the managers will be in stocks and there'll be a healthy supply of rotten tomatoes.
1883 2018-09-11 07:29:54 Those who will purchase stocks with this ideology will not make money in stock market consistently
1884 2018-09-11 07:29:37 Going long when the FTSE 100 is very low is always a good strategy, stocks tend to go up and let's face it not many people have the courage to short the stock market #FTSE
1885 2018-09-11 07:26:56 Given the accounting problems at Freddie and Fannie, my belief is there is no virtually no limit to how low the index funds are going to go from an accounting perspective.  Also, I understand more and more stocks are traded off the market these days.  That fits in.  Cash flow!
1886 2018-09-11 07:26:43 You’re no better. Cherry picking stocks as opposed to using the Dow Jones prices.
1887 2018-09-11 07:26:26 I was wondering why theatre stocks peaked yesterday...

1893 2018-09-11 07:22:15 #EVRH I struggle to think of many AIM stocks which have been more oversold than this? sp is now way lower than at launch of the App & all the licensing deals + venue deals, etc! What has happened to the concepts of ‘investment’ & ‘patience’ or is AIM now overrun by short termism?
1894 2018-09-11 07:21:05 ++ the pic u twt is only for 2nd quarter hun.. lmao ofc the stocks are higher bc thats the time of bp's cb are u ok?

1903 2018-09-11 07:11:56 The regular guy could buy stocks before, just not as many shares. Certainly not enough volume for day trading.
That doesn't answer my question.

Higher stocks is also supporting USDJPY and some talk of M&A activity last night also adding to demand for JPY crosses.

1933 2018-09-11 06:42:02 Pretty much all the ones I've been tweeting about.  Except China stocks for now.  If they are above the 8ema on daily.  I usually like to see my stochastic 4hr and 1hr curling at the bottom.  Once it hits top of 4hr I'm out 75%.

1935 2018-09-11 06:39:43 They just bought up their own stocks thus higher prices.  Works good until there are no fundamentals to support the rise.  The Rich get to keep more millions of dollars they paid very little tax on in the first place.  China wins, push and they dump debt bonds and cripple us!
1936 2018-09-11 06:39:36 Key question is the percentage relating to family homes versus investment properties. Family home value is largely irrelevant unless you actually plan on selling it. A report on liquid assets such as cash, stocks, pensions etc would be far more informative.

The rise in stocks is aided by tax cuts and loaning money.

2040 2018-09-11 05:29:42 How about metrics by OECD etc like tax burden, public spending or public sector wealth versus household wealth. Here in Nordic countries, public sector institutions tend to own much of means of production including the stocks of publicly traded companies.

Markets can correct 30% anytime.

They could have corrected in 2013, 2014 , 2015, 2016 , 2017 and they can even correct now.

Don't Predict - Prepare for any correction.

2128 2018-09-11 04:13:38 Also home improvement/ home builder stocks generally push higher during hurricane season. Sort of a seasonal trade.
2129 2018-09-11 04:13:25 No not exactly!!! You are spinning his words. Donald thinks he fixed the economy when President Obama handed him the economy on a silver platter! Yes when you give billionaires tax breaks and corporations so they can buy more of their own stocks it will help until we can’t pay $$
2130 2018-09-11 04:12:14 Hi. In these volatile times as twin deficit climb to over 7%, should we wait for sober levels in favorite stocks?
2131 2018-09-11 04:11:46 #nifty time to buy your favourite midcaps stocks
2132 2018-09-11 04:10:52 Majority of Americans don't have enough disposable income remaining after housing costs, food prices, gas prices, everyday survival costs, medical insurance -- to buy stocks.

Lucky you.
2133 2018-09-11 04:10:24 Then again, I'd be okay with more public punishment like they had in the old days. 
Could you imagine putting a purse snatcher in the stocks for a couple of days in front of a court house!?
Regardless of who they are or where they're from. Equal punishment under the law.

2137 2018-09-11 04:07:36 Обычно mutual funds/stocks/ETFs settle in T+2, то есть у клиента деньги в банке будут в лучшем случае на третий день, а то и в конце третьего дня. А некоторым надо вот прямо сейчас, потому что все пропало, спасите-помогите. Вот мы для этого только margin accounts и делаем.
2138 2018-09-11 04:07:18 Markets are also like life - jab khuda meherbaan toh gadha bhi pehelwan. Sometimes it is just sheer luck that drives stocks and sometimes despite all the number crunching one goes wrong!!!!
2139 2018-09-11 04:06:44 Wait hold on there fellas! As a card carrying liberal who would like to see new leadership I’d be happy to explain why I think she needs to go. Nov 2011 60 minutes did a story about members of Congress including NP would trade stocks based on information they received in private

2143 2018-09-11 04:05:37 Listening to an audiobook of Reminiscences of a Stock Operator.

2154 2018-09-11 04:01:23 Ок, это хорошо. А то я насмотрелась, когда приходят к нам серьёзные инвесторы, которые сберегают на пенсию/обучение/коттедж, и начинается: купите мне биткоина и weed stocks. И полцарства туда сразу.  И мы: ну уж нет. Вот вам 5% портфолио максимум, сами buy.

2158 2018-09-11 03:57:44 I already invested in Nike and some other stocks
2159 2018-09-11 03:57:34 But you said those numbers were phony during your campaign and stocks were in a bubble. Were you bullshitting then or now?

2162 2018-09-11 03:57:12 Well, URA is not Uranium specific as it was.  It now includes Daewoo and similar stocks so why expect it to follow U as it once did?  But, its biggest holding is Cameco but it is closer to its 52 wk low vs high.  The sector is divergent vs U3O8 price so that is interesting 2.

2165 2018-09-11 03:55:18 What happened to the "numbers are phony" you kept saying during the campaign? You said stocks were in a bubble and they're 50% higher. Were you trying to trick voters then or are you lying now? Wtf dude?
2166 2018-09-11 03:50:33 true sir, but commodity stocks peak out before their earnings peak out, so also to be a bit careful
2167 2018-09-11 03:50:24 rise and fall .........short or medium term is ALWAYS happening across the whole spectrum of stocks.....
point is there is NO panic......especially in experienced investors or MFs

2174 2018-09-11 03:46:37 You should understand that this is not a stock advisory service. Nobody makes profit in the market for the long term just by following tweets. And he made his point clear about not naming stocks.

2177 2018-09-11 03:45:47 Hey I have question. Do you think that buying stocks for Uber is a good idea? I recently read that Uber might go go public in 2019. This means the public can buy stocks. If Uber does go public in 2018, would it be a good idea to invest? I just need some advice/ guidance. Thanks
2178 2018-09-11 03:43:30 No surprise the AUD turnaround occurred at the same time Chinese stocks and CNH did too. Tad quiet, obviously.

2181 2018-09-11 03:42:44 When were stocks not in Danger Zone.

Markets can correct 30% anytime.

They could have corrected in 2013, 2014 , 2015, 2016 , 2017 and they can even correct now.

Don't Predict - Prepare for any correction.

2185 2018-09-11 03:41:54 Thanks for posting these always good to hear someone elses perspective, to make sure you aren't just reflecting your own biases onto the stocks.
2186 2018-09-11 03:41:54 Trump lies that unemployment rate less than GDP growth in 100 yrs. It's done that +/- 50 times in 100 yrs. Fundamentals of economy are same as for past 5-6 yrs. Trump trade war is a major threat to that. Real rate wage growth is zero due to inflation rate. Stocks factor for 1%

2190 2018-09-11 03:34:51 Just keep giving your badass opinion on these stocks my friend. That sounds reasonable to me.
2191 2018-09-11 03:33:33 He owns the soccer team I like too. He’s a prick to us. Doesn’t do shit or invest his money. He bought out all the fans stocks and forced them to sell to him for less than they were worth.
2192 2018-09-11 03:33:21 As of 11:30 a.m., PSEi 7,500.03 down 96.12 points or 1.27 percent.  #PSEiupdate #PSEi #stocks
2193 2018-09-11 03:33:05 Let’s be truthful! You along with @SenateGOP @HouseGOP took @BarackObama steady stable economic growth then stole 1.5 Trillion from US Treasury gave it to wealthy & corps that bought back stocks to give us a false economy that when record deficit comes due we are screwed! Per CBO
2194 2018-09-11 03:32:52 Stock prices are all about reactions of the public and the share holders. The share holders got kinda hot under the collar so the stocks dropped. They have only been going back up sense.
2195 2018-09-11 03:31:28 So many good stocks to buy!  Need more money huhu
2196 2018-09-11 03:31:23 I held off saying anything about $litefox until tonight and then just after I did retweet the stocks exchange announcement it looks like the telegram was deleted and there was a huge sell off... DYOR... this one is not looking good.

2199 2018-09-11 03:30:05 It’s definitely possible but gold is facing headwinds including upcoming fed rate hikes (sept/dec) The dollar would need to weaken a bit. If gold stays weak into ‘19 it’s going to drag down mining stocks. Are you long in it?
2200 2018-09-11 03:27:17 Exactly my point - so we can’t use trading charts for fundamental assets to compare their action with crypto. The two are so very different. Anyway, I’m a precious metals dealer so I don’t compare silver or gold with stocks so I can’t compare or accept chart action with crypto 
2201 2018-09-11 03:26:39 Usually when a stocks hits 200-220 for the first time and corrects, the corrections ends near 123/113/97 ... I don't know why but Algo's could b in play there. 
Just try digging up as many charts as possible, you would realise.
If it's breaking 88 then it's difficult to move up
2202 2018-09-11 03:26:10 Funny, I just sold my Nike stocks xD. AMZN pretty weak atm but i want to get in on it soon

2204 2018-09-11 03:26:03 Question asked to me yesterday? 

I said end of correction in auto stocks. When will they move up. 

Remember, when correction ends, ,upmove also takes similar time (vehicle is taking U turn). So, good part is correction ended so accumulation can be the choice now
2205 2018-09-11 03:23:39 I don't advise shorting what might be a mega-trend. As odd as it sounds $TLRY is one of those stocks, with around 16M share float that could suddenly go parabolic on or before Mid October. For really no fundamental reason just soar to $500-$1000/share as it becomes a "Mania" .
2206 2018-09-11 03:21:55 it says like 20% on wiki but that’s bc it’s a public company anyway so still fuck him even if he didn’t own any stocks he would still be making all the music and artist decisions
2207 2018-09-11 03:21:41 You may find this shocking but Asian stocks are down once again tonight. Trump has bombed their markets. If trend remains this will make the 9th out of 12 negative months for where 50% of world GDP is for which it isn't even anywhere close to a recession. #Mania
2208 2018-09-11 03:18:50 Hey man I'm heavily invested in pot stocks and am still holding majority of my positions. Just a word of caution to not be lost in the sauce. Things dont go up forever in any market.

2212 2018-09-11 03:16:01 Again. What are you on about? I'm down on what??? I will "bash" whatever stocks I decide.  And those who resort to insults have lost the argument. Have a nice day.
2213 2018-09-11 03:15:34 Obama had well thought out policies, so he gets some of the credit! Trump did help the rich get richer, do he can claim that part! Stocks mean squat to those on Main Street!!

Most U.S. stocks hung onto gains to close higher even as FANG weakness and lingering concern over U.S. and China trade tensions weighed on investor optimism.
The yield on 10-year Treasuries held at 2.93 percent and the two-year yield clung to 2.71 percent.

2233 2018-09-11 02:59:41 I actually think it’s hilarious that Tesla’s stock prices went down so drastically after Elon Musk smoked weed

It really shows how ridiculously uptight investors in these companies are that they would sell their stocks so quickly after he harmlessly smoked a joint
2234 2018-09-11 02:59:09 i dont seem to notice tweets on strikes in midcaps and stocks of late - this is how patient disciplined investing will make a differnce . An asset class in a boom makes the asset manager feel like a creator .Like the geeta says samay balwan naki liquidity aur fund manager .

2239 2018-09-11 02:53:52 Trump wants you to believe that. But wage growth is as stagnant as it was. The tax cuts allowed companies to buy back stocks. A few have bonuses,  but the larger part went to the stockholders.

2246 2018-09-11 02:47:59 Good, except him into Supreme Court and invest in hangar stocks because they will be flying off the wracks.
2247 2018-09-11 02:47:00 Stocks in the news: Sun Pharma, JP Associates, Jai Corp, Essel Propack, Manali Petro, NMDC
Sun Pharma | JP Associates | Jai Corp | Essel Propack and Manali Petro are stocks, which are in news today.
2248 2018-09-11 02:46:42 Again it has nothing to do with the asset especially in a speculative market like cannabis stocks.

Crypto doesnt go up based on nothing it goes up on the same speculation that makes cannabis stocks go up. Buyers and sellers. Supply and demand.
2249 2018-09-11 02:46:29 We don't care. You and the harpertwits never balanced one in ten years. That fake you produced by selling GM stocks doesn't count. You are, were and always will be a joke and a failure.

2255 2018-09-11 02:41:00 @babarrackass @wegotthis9713 I agree. No recent license news so people sell and chase other shiny weed stocks that are pumping.
2256 2018-09-11 02:40:23 Tomorrow's watchlist:
$PNAT, $SOAN, $NLST, $RETC, and $PBYA
Pot stocks : $CVSI
2257 2018-09-11 02:40:05 I use Stash for hobby investing. It allows you to invest in clusters of stocks.

I’m invested in 2 different tech clusters. Both had twitter included and were stagnant or declining. Stash removed twitter and both clusters shot up.

Twitter’s loss outweighed all other gains.
2258 2018-09-11 02:39:00 $LCI and $TLRY completely different stocks ..$TLRY was an incredible run with the pot sector exploding. $LCI Oversold, panic selling pushing it to 4.60. plenty of room to run for this stock.
2259 2018-09-11 02:38:33 Also that helps the small accounts to grow because large stocks there will be so slow growth
2260 2018-09-11 02:37:49 It’s very helpful I appreciate your work. One of your videos you said don’t trade low float, it doesn’t have technical analysis, I agree with that as I learned a lot about technicals but there’s nothing to see in those POS stocks. But they move in a big %
2261 2018-09-11 02:37:45 Not to be morbid,  but since its a reality regardless..... Gas Stocks Up?
2262 2018-09-11 02:37:16 Tomando como ejemplo los últimos 12, se gastaron todos los stocks. Desahorro tremendo. Ahora hay q pagar el pato. El populismo argento ha sido así. Te gastas stock capital y q le explote al otro (reservas BCRA, energía, ahorro)
2263 2018-09-11 02:34:52 I know that I am a joke to a lot in the hood because the fact that I don't spend every dime on clothes. I'll let everyone know I love #bitcoin and stocks ,but I do have my #Luxury as well. What separates me from the rest is #education.

2270 2018-09-11 02:30:53 I watched his interview with @joerogan where he smoked with @elonmusk
I was a little surprised but as we've seen Musk is a big risk taker and with the social stigma on marijuana loosening in America I'd be surprised if stocks take a big hit solely based on this

2293 2018-09-11 02:18:30 stocks are bullshit, as soon as i sell all my stocks because they dropped so much, within a month it goes back up by 200%
2294 2018-09-11 02:18:00 You don’t think their little parade was over after the crash do you? No, no, no. They went around and bought stocks and foreclosed land and homes for cheap. They got over qualified people on the cheap in lesser rolls. On and on the rabbit whole goes.
2295 2018-09-11 02:17:14 They only attack for they are jealous and live hopeless lives
2296 2018-09-11 02:16:32 I like Trump because he does everything he says he's going to. My stocks have gone sky high, my health insurance started offering more for less payout. I go on people's actions not their words.

2304 2018-09-11 02:12:22 I think we all think there will be a dip..thinking stocks will start trading on fundamentals... but look at Tods statement with the size of the market world wide... they could keep trading higher on future expectations IE Germany starts showing real growth etc

2317 2018-09-11 02:02:23 @nikunj_mittal   Bro,  What do you think of indiabulls reas estate? While other group stocks are doing well, this is at bottom. What is your view?
2318 2018-09-11 02:02:13 Sounds very on brand for Btc but the reality is if a $BN market cap stock issues on a “$50mn” chain the 50mn chain would most likely increase in value. And 2 Settlement isn’t as time sensitive for stocks so waiting for more confirms is a non issue.
2319 2018-09-11 02:01:41 Seriously.  Do you do research or just short the rising cannibis stocks?  Doesn’t take much to reseach that.  Lacking credibility day by day!

2326 2018-09-11 01:57:26 China’s sinking stocks are on the verge of an unwelcome milestone. The Shanghai Composite Index fell 1.2 percent on Monday to within 15 points of where it bottomed out in 2016. If the measure drops further, it’ll be trading at the lowest since November 2014 - BBG.

2332 2018-09-11 01:53:03 Wow @SeekingAlpha really hates AMZN stocks. in last 2 yrs they have been predicting how the stock will tank anytime on a weekly basis. The stock has grown 3x since then.
2333 2018-09-11 01:50:49 I tried back testing of your squeeze BO strategy and it perfectly works out for the stocks you had mentioned in your videos. Thanks to you could understand the strategy that can be really useful

Not about the lives of those lost, but to actually stop trading stocks?
  is Trump’s first and foremost priority, whether it’s his or maybe his is what is #1.
His statement alone totally explains .

2340 2018-09-11 01:45:22 Is there any reason to be buying stocks right now instead of crypto? 

Like shares of ETF's / REITS on Robinhood vs just buying as much BTC as possible right now?
2341 2018-09-11 01:44:52 Untradable stocks on TEFS can only be traded in a  demo account.  There is no such thing as giving limit users access to tradable CFDs. The CFDs broker either allows it or doesn't.
2342 2018-09-11 01:44:26 Feels like $WEED $CGC isn’t leading the group anymore. $APH, $TRST.TO & $HEXO doing their own thing. But U.S. FOMO is still very influential, like we saw recently with $TRST. I’m watching for stocks that will get U.S. TV coverage or rumour/news of a NYSE/NASDAQ listing.

2371 2018-09-11 01:26:24 I think in severe market correction no guarantees on anything.  Liquidity event takes no prisoners.  Add after stocks show you the way.
2372 2018-09-11 01:25:11 It just hit me that Trump & his sons could be contacting all of their #Trumpicans to deliberately hurt #Nike by putting a #ban on them or sell their #stocks!So for every company they have a dispute with they will mess with their reputation & #Marketing!
2373 2018-09-11 01:24:21 I read today that marijuana stocks are on fire.  Where does that leave the smoldering Gro3 sub?  Please lay out what you have done, what commitments are in place and what revenues can be expected as a result.  Why don't we have ANY numbers?
2374 2018-09-11 01:24:06 @realDonaldTrump  NIKE sales UP by 31% NIKE stocks up by 2.2% as usual you get it wrong Donnie. Time for you to retire
2375 2018-09-11 01:23:20 @seanhannity I agree Sean that this midterm election is critical to insure @realDonaldTrump continues his #AmericaFirst #MAGA policies. 
If Dems take control this November, kiss your 401k good bye.  Stocks will drop deeply the next day.

2378 2018-09-11 01:21:09 I bet we'd raise millions if we put this cunt in the stocks and thew anything we could find at him. He's a stupid moronic smug slap head who someone should draw a line down his bald head and make it look like the arse he is!

2380 2018-09-11 01:19:01 last wasde had them at 19.5 mmt production & 14.2 exports leaving pipeline 0.31 mmt c/o. basically all major exporters except US are pushing super tight ending stocks (which is what drives projections for us exports in 2nd half of MY)
2381 2018-09-11 01:18:41 Yea bro. Stocks weren't moving for the longest. Now all of a sudden Kap and Serena makin noise
2382 2018-09-11 01:18:26 @InsideCityHall selling 5bn of fossil fuel related stocks back to the market will mean nothing. A couple days worth of trading or less depending what the names are and what banks get the trades..It’ll make some nice comm for the desks that get the trades though. @errollouis
2383 2018-09-11 01:16:56 Stocks in sticks! I’d invest in that!

2387 2018-09-11 01:15:23 I've had multiple people mistime their off stage punish game while attempting to gimp me as Ness, then eat a PK Thunder 2, and get stage spiked after missing the tech. While that's dumb, what was absolutely dumb was when I won a set and all 4 stocks were taken this way. 
2388 2018-09-11 01:15:21 The goal of these news outlets, be they conservative, or liberal, is to feed your biases for glutinous amount of time, so you can purchase the products of their advertisers. They need you to believe once the opening bell rings on those stocks.
2389 2018-09-11 01:14:58 Because that's what penny stocks do.
2390 2018-09-11 01:14:28 Jack Ma annouced his intention for retire next year; without any doubt, one of the most visionary entrepreneurs in the last years, an incredible Leadership example; stocks reacted on that;  but I’m sure his succession plan and transformative DNA will keep Alibaba on the top
2391 2018-09-11 01:14:16 Currencies, bonds and stocks marked time overnight as markets wait for the next trade shoe to drop. European shares and the British Pound made modest gains on positive Brexit commentary, but US markets lagged as pressure fell on blue chip stocks @MicMcCarthy_CMC
2392 2018-09-11 01:13:37 Short interest supports stocks.
2393 2018-09-11 01:12:32 mainstream media encourages negative sentiment on @Tesla stocks.    9m views for @joerogan and rising 152k views for @cnbc and falling.

2399 2018-09-11 01:09:03 So can bonds, stocks, derivatives, and other fully transparent, publicly traded investment vehicles with a fraction of the cost.
2400 2018-09-11 01:07:16 No, just expressing my opinion. But thanks for your concern. I'm actually doing a lot of celebrating. My President has our economy in high gear and my stocks are making me a lot of money this year. Hope your are too!
2401 2018-09-11 01:06:49 European stocks rose on Monday, underpinned by a surge in Italian equities as the populist government reassured markets that its 2019 budget would meet EU fiscal rules
2402 2018-09-11 01:06:09 Or the CEO of Nike U.S. is brilliant. I agree with you it’s awful but if your company is going to be hit with 200% tariffs from  U.S. how do you maintain inventory until the trade war is over? Make a huge political statement watch stocks fall and investors buy back save millions.
2403 2018-09-11 01:05:17 FED did buy stocks thru other Central Banks . It’s all one system now.
2404 2018-09-11 01:04:55 US stocks mostly rose on Monday, with the S&P 500 and NASDAQ indices posting their first rise in five days, although global trade tensions continued to weigh on broader market sentiment.
2405 2018-09-11 01:03:56 it’s a highly advanced statement that refers to the current downtrend of overall stock market conditions, referring to myself as someone who usually invests in stocks actively trending up, however due to said market conditions, it is hard to make a living.
2406 2018-09-11 01:03:38 I have a watchlist of about 100 stocks on them. I look for ones that are just breaking through the 20SMA to either the upside or downside or slightly above and below on the daily chart.

2413 2018-09-11 01:01:39 Last night was quiet on Wall St, stocks edged higher ending the 4day losing streak for the S&P. Eyes will be on the Chinese market open aftr heavy falls again yesterday. US 2yrs touched a new decade high (2.72%) last night. Today in markets NAB business survery is out at 11:30
2414 2018-09-11 01:00:17 I just made same statement. The DOW is inflated due to companies buying back their own stocks. This is what they're doing with their extra cash flow. They're not giving raises or benefits due to it cutting into their profits. Ray Charles could see this but not Trump's cult.
2415 2018-09-11 00:58:31 Oh im hype. I been waitin to see how they gon boost their stocks this year

2420 2018-09-11 00:56:14 My teams get treated like 2nd class. The cheapest/worst owners that do nothing but suck the life out of these franchise and fanbase. Talk to me when you have a Wilpon and Dolan as owner who make their franchise laughing stocks for the entire sports world to laugh at 24/7.

2424 2018-09-11 00:52:47 Anecdotally, my impression is that Robinhood users tend to buy "cheaper" stocks (often 1-share at a time). So converting with an average price of $50/shr may be pretty far off.
2425 2018-09-11 00:52:11 basically yea, I can trade stocks except penny stocks and options cuz they are risky. I opened an account, I did every step. I just tried to do an option trade today and it said error, so i called and thats what they said

2431 2018-09-11 00:47:58 How is it negative campaigning if it is the truth about how you voted?  You also voted to not ban bump stocks.  It is ironic you “mudsling” at the end of a press release criticizing Norm for mudslinging. Legislatures are Part Time, many legislators have full time jobs.
2432 2018-09-11 00:46:09 Because half of the nation is in poverty, property values and stocks are not good indicators for how the majority of the country is doing, and taxes and regulations being down is an awful thing.

It is impossible for us to turn into Venezuela.
2433 2018-09-11 00:44:02 Thinking about companies stocks going up or down as soon as tr-mp mentions them, and whether it's a good mention or bad. I wonder about that a lot..like do people or other companies pay him to do that? He seems to know if it will

2446 2018-09-11 00:31:09 If you have your money in a bank, they have an iOU on your money. If you invest in stocks, the broker has an iOU on your funds. You could lose your money with these 2 examples. BUT, Crypto, you own your money. No one else!

The real money is on her dramas, movies that got canceled or delayed and stocks . And if she did tax evasion, she might have to pay millions millions for penalty

2449 2018-09-11 00:30:08 lower high, followed by a lower low after a parabolic move upwards and major fomo by people that never traded stocks in their life
2450 2018-09-11 00:28:44 I'm pretty sure buying stocks during every recession in the last 100 years would have generated performance slightly better than buying/shorting based on Tweets published by hedge fund managers who tweet a lot.
2451 2018-09-11 00:25:17 So true. It was an amazing conversation with a creative successful man. Why do we tear each other down like this? The 24 hour news networks are the equivalent of the modern day stocks at midday.
2452 2018-09-11 00:24:41 when does a bank determine to split stocks? I am awaiting for the others to split stock unless there is a reason, and what could that be
2453 2018-09-11 00:24:37 Wow. Just went through all the hassle of signing up with interactive brokers. Wanted to fund a small cash account for options and penny stocks then they tell me that they are risky and you need to be over 21 to trade. It doesn’t say that anywhere on the website

2456 2018-09-11 00:23:26 Today I purchased some blue chip dived end stocks, bonds and a lottery ticket im trying to make it by any means necessary 
2457 2018-09-11 00:21:22 Didn’t make a single trade today. I had some stocks i were watching but never triggered. Looks like we might get some decent action tomorrow. Lots of movers AH
2458 2018-09-11 00:19:58 Smoking a blunt while bumping @NipseyHussle “hussle & and motivate” while I check my stocks. Nah, I’m not rich or paid like that... yet!

2460 2018-09-11 00:18:44 Ah, so either 50% of the world's #uranium producers suddenly create a massive surge in #U3O8 supply or share prices of uranium stocks surge higher. Which one is more likely?
2461 2018-09-11 00:17:46 1st if you read it it’s says that was made in 2016. Lots of things happened the past 2 years. (Racist trump) And even that is pure BS. You have a twitter scroll thru ur TL and you’ll see vids of black ppl being abused by cops and you said Nike sales. Nike stocks are up 2.24%.
2462 2018-09-11 00:16:58 What other platforms are offering the ability to tap trained professionals to make passive income using not only the crypto market but stocks and other asset classes? The potential is huge.

2470 2018-09-11 00:12:21 AR are no difference than a 223 hunting rifle. Bump stocks they can get rid of those. However, home checks if someone “breaks into” my home and “steals” my weapons first off they have committed a crime. So law biding citizen isn’t the issue and my locked home is proper storage
