5 2018-12-27 23:59:21 Can I justify £100 on a pair of shoes I already have because my current ones are covered in oil grease and tea stains?
It’ll be a week’s worth of tips

7 2018-12-27 23:58:58 I need a right tire rod, and a oil change  oh and some struts  riding on prayers hunny
8 2018-12-27 23:58:58 You know that the VAST MAJORITY of Rare Earth Metals don't get used in #Renewables ?
EG: Cerium - Used in catalytic converters in cars,.
Lanthanumare used in the process of refining crude oil.

Does that bother you too or are you, as I suspect, just VIRTUE SIGNALLING?
9 2018-12-27 23:58:57 Oh they did. I mean deep down we all knew they would. But they did. The list of oil cos has been released. Venezuela’s hilariously broken Chavez nationalized company is on the list. I wonder if the postal service still works there?
10 2018-12-27 23:58:55 I got a new tarot deck recently. I bought my old one when my life was very different; I just didn't feel as connected to it anymore. But when I found my new one and opened the sample/display box, it was an instant feeling of "STOP DRILLING, YOU'VE HIT OIL" (1/3)
11 2018-12-27 23:58:44 So what about the guy who killed his wife, and two daughters putting one in an oil drum, or the guy that killed his fiancée leaving behind two kids.  Do we need a wall for these crimes.

13 2018-12-27 23:57:58 Eat what you want! What you real life should try is Dr. bronners soap to wash your face , argan oil for moisture in the am, and rosehip oil for moisture at night. Also have African black soap on hand for when you are feeling a break out come on but not everyday use.

30 2018-12-27 23:57:48 There is no way 100,000 jobs were lost. Where did you find these fabricated figures? In fact the Canadian economy is doing well accept for a handful of disgruntled oil workers who are still working and want to separate from Canada. You love this!
31 2018-12-27 23:57:48 we got an OIL DIFFUSER, we got a SALT LAMP, we got FUZZY SOCKS, we got cozy BLANKETS, we got PIZZA ROLLS, we cannot GET any more cliché self care in this house!

How *the actual fUcK* do you successfully get out oil stains from clothes??? Is it even possible?
37 2018-12-27 23:57:20 Just in time for some New Years good news. My wife has been offered an incredible job that will allow her to work remotely full time. She has been working hard toward this for over 12 years and has finally struck oil in today's blisteringly difficult job market.

43 2018-12-27 23:56:49 It costs me $100+ for an oil change, $120 to change between winter and summer tires, not to mention storage. How does the savings of $2.00 per fill every week stack up vs. expenses of $500+ per year?
44 2018-12-27 23:56:47 Oil and water never mix.
45 2018-12-27 23:56:33 Nope it’s a repellent. Just rub that on your body and the mosquitoes will avoid you. The marks you will need black cumin oil which you can find at dischem for R90.
46 2018-12-27 23:56:27 Oil destroyed our lower added value industries because it pushed up the value of the pound. So exports dropped and imports rose. Nothing to do with the EU.
47 2018-12-27 23:56:26 i see! which one is your favorite? i really want to diffuse oils but i still haven't bought the diffuser :( right now i use tea tree oil on my acne spots and on foot soaks + rosehip seed oil on undereyes

79 2018-12-27 23:52:45 Of course not. I was commented on them getting any of their speculation monies back. NO RAW BITUMEN should ever be transported except to a refinery at its doorstep. And this, only while we phase out oil.
80 2018-12-27 23:52:44 Virgin olive oil. Hear it up a little and massage it onto your eyebrows.

88 2018-12-27 23:52:21 PC’s had a 40+ year dictatorship in Alberta and our oil only flows south because of it. You’re the reason we’re in this mess, not Notley and the NDP. If elected, how will you repair the damage your party created? You couldn’t get it done in the last 46yrs. Scumbags.

93 2018-12-27 23:52:06 I’m kinda glad this popped up on my TL...cus I be seeing ppl with the Exotic carts & i been iffy on it thinking it may be too artificial. More reason for me to start making my own oil, or get carts from ppl who I know for a fact make their own...
94 2018-12-27 23:52:05 I went to get an oil change and they told me mad stuff was leaking. The car started and it’s not smoking so I think it’s all good

101 2018-12-27 23:51:20 There is a very simple solution.  You can’t produce the oil (allow for flaring for a short test period) without conserving the gas too. Law in Alberta, Sask and BC.
102 2018-12-27 23:51:20 So the half a million in oil and gas donations not from executives were individual donations made by earnest gas company employees interested in a democratic candidate and definitely not bundled by the same oil and gas companies who stand to gain from beto, right?
103 2018-12-27 23:51:08 Slide in there reeves before the oil gets dry

107 2018-12-27 23:50:50 Gee .@joshtpm don't burst a blood vessel in your forehead or anything in desperate frenzy to protest too much "debunking" facts as recorded in OpenSecrets and confirmed by them -- I wonder why you're SO in love with #EmptySuit Beto? Big investment in oil & gas?

109 2018-12-27 23:50:29 The fact that you had to go back that far to find an argument why government shutdowns are bad shows that they aren’t bad, bro.
110 2018-12-27 23:50:22 It wouldn't surprise me if it was all #fakenews,but it also could be true that there was a pipeline or oil interestsand it just isn't the main reason for the war. One the other hand one would be called Islamic pipeline, so I guess it's all ludicrous.
111 2018-12-27 23:50:12 Yet again you havent answered any question . It's ok that you cant deny the facts ... let's not even bring up another fact of oil . Didnt Obama say we couldn't drill our way to energy independence.  Well we have done that also !
112 2018-12-27 23:50:08 Nope,
Why would the left vote for someone who takes oil money,
The left wants to save the planet not end life on it.

Sorry we are not into popular candidates, its all about policy.

124 2018-12-27 23:48:44 Who would have thought that. Much as I don't blame England for the power game they play, they have different rules for different countries, simply because Scotland has oil.
125 2018-12-27 23:48:39 Why would they want dirty, old oil or coal tech when we've got renewables that will do the same?

140 2018-12-27 23:47:25 A pretty good percentage of the promoted tweets I see are brands/industries trying to save face. Mostly astroturf pro oil/coal, but also lots of company accounts trying to rehabilitate—Nestle saying they don't steal water, Johnson&Johnson saying they didn't have asbestos in talc.

142 2018-12-27 23:47:18 Not forgetting military resources. That gets overlooked when the focus is on oil. Scotland is crucial for the Trident base, air bases and low flying territory, submarine exercise grounds, missile testing aerospace, etc..
143 2018-12-27 23:47:07 Feels like 2016.. fed hikes in dec 2015 as oil in free fall and credit melting down
144 2018-12-27 23:46:58 But growth fell to 2.5 percent in the third quarter, coinciding with a slide in oil prices, which have disproportionately driven investment growth under Trump, compared to his recent predecessors"
145 2018-12-27 23:46:48 Oil and gas are corporations, and well-established ones at that. Yes, they make a profit off me so I shouldn't be paying them twice. I'm not saying that Tesla should be getting subsidies, either. Nuclear has serious downsides. Renewables giving us energy is no less a good thing.
146 2018-12-27 23:46:47 How do you manage to break down a Toyota Corolla??? Like keep the oil changed and that shit will last long enough for your grandchildren.
147 2018-12-27 23:46:44 I didn’t know EVOO meant extra virgin olive oil until like a few months ago, I thought all these fitness people were talking about some sort of salad dressing lmaooo

149 2018-12-27 23:46:24 Half of the nation knows the feeling..  We felt the same when snake oil salesman, obama was elected by the ignorant, the fraudsters,  the illegals, the dead, the welfare crowd and the racists.
150 2018-12-27 23:46:15 David Cameron was keen to take ownership of "The Prime Minister's Dementia Challenge". So I assume the drugs for dementia and best social care in the world are in the pipeline? A bit like the Prime Minister's Brexit? A posh snake oil salesman.
151 2018-12-27 23:46:13 At most 12 years to runaway warming—a climate apocalypse that spells the breakdown of society & our food and power supply—NO 2nd CHANCE.

In 2020, it's all about TRUST.

As a corporate centrist from Texas, BetOil can NOT be trusted to take on big oil, remember that!

156 2018-12-27 23:46:05 I knew that 99.9% H2 is produced from oil fractions in refineries through steamforming, catforming etc. Same CO2 as all the other fossil fuels.
157 2018-12-27 23:45:58 I’ve been in the south for, like, 4 days but already my face has transformed from dehydrated to oil slick over ducking night...
158 2018-12-27 23:45:55 Absolutely. Especially with some gauze pads and 3 in 1 oil.

163 2018-12-27 23:45:44 We know profit is good 4 the business WE work 4 or WE own. Why not also 4 every business? Selfish profit is good 4 small salon and big oil.
164 2018-12-27 23:45:41 Everyone on the essential oil diffuser kick  shit I might get one lmao
165 2018-12-27 23:45:38 Not without oil. Everything you describe ultimately relies on global commodity chains fuelled by oil. We are privileged in that we can choose how we live. Most of the global population does not have that luxury. We can't tech our way out of this mess. And you forgot meat eating.
166 2018-12-27 23:45:34 @EmmaVigeland and to think you guys don't understand how the Democrats lost West Virginia, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, keep threatening to kill the Coal, Oil, and Gas industries and these states wont flip for a long time.
167 2018-12-27 23:45:33 They're bashing Beto for his duplicitous oil money... among other things
168 2018-12-27 23:45:30 I got a Wawa hoagie for dinner. Honey turkey, hot pepper cheese, bacon, onions, jalapeños, tomatoes, mayo, and oil. I think that this is probably the best combo I’ve ever ordered. I’m braggin.
169 2018-12-27 23:45:23 This idiot does realize that the jet stream moves west to east, right? Whistler would see more results from Fukushima than the Alberta oil sands. What a tool.
170 2018-12-27 23:45:11 How can they increase gas prices , when the price of oil is at 44.61 a barrel. Doesn't gas go up when oil goes up,? Gas shouldn't go up when oil goes down?  Just a Government corruption on price fixing.
171 2018-12-27 23:45:07 Don’t let me get mad off the oil i turn into a mighty morphing power ranger  I’m ending this shit NOW

175 2018-12-27 23:44:32 ....billions on tourism alone. Forget the oil! But in the end I feel no one really asks all the little people. I honestly thought the www way back when would bring world peace because we can all talk to each other. The villagers!

180 2018-12-27 23:43:58 I love @theouai oil it’s life changing
181 2018-12-27 23:43:53 Kiehl’s rare earth serisi harika günlük temizleyicisini toniğini ve maskesini kullanıyorum ve o kadar farkını gördüm ki kullandığım hiçbir ürün bu kadar etki etmemişti nemlendirici olarak da ultra facial oil free ürününü kullanıyorum kesinlikle tavsiye ederim efso
182 2018-12-27 23:43:47 Beto takes more money from the oil & gas industry (I don’t care the size) than all but one in Congress.

Beto votes against things like offshore drilling bans.

Fossil fuels are destroying our planet’s habitability.

Why is it crazy for Sirota to connect those dots?
183 2018-12-27 23:43:43 This is your daily reminder that the oil industry is cancer.

187 2018-12-27 23:43:09 You clearly don't know bugger all about the oil business. Or oil. But hey, as long as it doesn't affect your island lifestyle, what the heck.
188 2018-12-27 23:43:02 Venezuela was just a case of sabotage. I mean who doesn't want oil at this era when everyone depend on it. Capitalists have petitioned for Venezuela to be sanctioned and have paid dearly for it. Our prayers is that BRICS should help Venezuela and disappoint capitalists.

196 2018-12-27 23:42:46 Who plugged in with the oil cartridges
197 2018-12-27 23:42:46 Maybe worth looking in to but when “Kentucky” came to visit me and his dog stopped eating for his sitter he had the sitter put a very little bit of coconut oil on the food and the dog ate it right up.

199 2018-12-27 23:42:38 I can’t wait to buy one of those giant inflatable slides pour gallons of baby oil down it and go to work sliding around in there
200 2018-12-27 23:42:23 You were recently suggesting paying more for resources (oil) was somehow going to make us all better off, so this is straight out of your playbook, right?
201 2018-12-27 23:42:18    Satisfying: in low-calorie diets, the presence of olive oil is interesting because it relieves the feeling of hunger. In addition, its consumption has been associated with the production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that regulates moods. #AOVE #aceitedeoliva #EVOO #o
202 2018-12-27 23:42:18 The  oil and gas industry companies have made profits and keeping us warm and giving us fuel for transportation is a good thing... tesla on the other hand has yet to make a profit and it is expensive compared to fossil fuel’s We should be pushing nuclear

208 2018-12-27 23:41:56 I knew Bill Clinton was selling snake oil in early 1992 but I felt he could win. Paul Tsongas met my values... but winning matters. This time Dems should be all-in, but without the devisive litmus tests. Eyes on the prize.
209 2018-12-27 23:41:48 Use lavender oil
210 2018-12-27 23:41:47 y’all ever put oil on an itchy part of your scalp and experience a borderline orgasm? 
211 2018-12-27 23:41:35 I know if i was in a war zone the last thing i would bring with me from home is a bright red hat that who light me up like a Christmas tree so you carry selling the snake oil
212 2018-12-27 23:41:25 Loved my CB900 just a shame the engine internals were made of chocolate, blew it up with the other half on the back, realised something was going wrong when I got a dig in the ribs off her for the red hot engine oil spraying onto her leg #knackeredjeanandengine
213 2018-12-27 23:41:24 We talk to the pet store lady about pepper and she said she highly recommends giving her CBD oil because she has anger issues 
Looks like dogs do have the same traits as their owners 
214 2018-12-27 23:41:12 Oooh, a group of anonymous "scientists" funded by big oil, must be legit.
215 2018-12-27 23:41:06 Yup. Definitely not a Dictatorship. Most democratically elected government in the world. Elections just don't go the way Amerika like, despite CIA interference. Also, largest oil reserves in the world. Nuff said.

218 2018-12-27 23:40:27 This oil is making me feel good tho
219 2018-12-27 23:40:24 and tapping freshwater, a limited non renewable for oil drilling is a no no imo  retail of spring water (rough estimate) $38/barrel is ~same as light oil price.  using water to get at oil seems nonsensical @chigrl   reference for futures trading
220 2018-12-27 23:40:23 Fun fact, wire transfers originating from the US  and going to Mexico is Mexico's largest source of income, surpassing oil revenues recently. They come here to steal American's jobs, then send the money back home to Mexico.
221 2018-12-27 23:40:18 Ugggh

Lemme tell ya about getting jalapeno oil in your eye 

That is bad too

Be safe & get well soon!
222 2018-12-27 23:40:16 Ah bit unfair. I know since the oil money came in its changed the club, but before that they always seemed a decent club & bunch of fans. Depends where you’re from tho of course.
223 2018-12-27 23:40:12 え、君顎あるの？顎ってやっぱりどこかで買うの？僕顎持ってないんだけど。
224 2018-12-27 23:40:06 Good. We are talking about climate change after all. We have plenty of other resources that aren't oil and coal.
225 2018-12-27 23:40:05 I hope they come with neverending coffee, like Elijah's cruse of oil. If so, bomb diggity.

233 2018-12-27 23:39:07 Chose to go with tanning oil over sunscreen and it’s safe to say mistakes were made

237 2018-12-27 23:38:41 Cook them in boiling water for not more than 4 minutes. Then fry them in oil or butter with chopped garlic for 2 minutes, remove the sprouts from pan to dish, scatter grated parmesan over them and serve.
238 2018-12-27 23:38:23 In NYC, #6 oil is banned now. #4 oil ends in 2030 at the latest (we are trying to accelerate that). #2 oil must now be ultra-low sulfur diesel. NYC air is cleaner than in 50 years due to reduced PM2.5.
239 2018-12-27 23:38:23 Those are getting shut down soon. Trudeau is trying to phase oil out and coal is done in 2029. Outside of that we don't ship large scale to majority of the world outside of the USA
240 2018-12-27 23:38:13 @realDonaldTrump Syria, Turkey and Russia are no friends of Israel. Staggering, Don, that you are throwing Israel under the bus. Wonder if Rupert is worried about his oil investments in the Golan Heights?
241 2018-12-27 23:38:09 When you’re trying to live more zen so you now have an oil defuser 
242 2018-12-27 23:38:08 No harm but I’m 27 ans i never been to a MALE REVEIW where’s the baby oil
243 2018-12-27 23:38:06 I thought oil and water don't mix. 
So a water thought from an oil guru may not hold water...?
244 2018-12-27 23:38:01 But his choice was to fight a war to protect oil interests or attack a country based on faulty intelligence. Terrorism still exists. Our “interventions” have created ISIS recruits.
245 2018-12-27 23:37:58 Can a hair mask actually boost hair growth? Yes! Here’s how: Using a coconut oil hair mask moisturizes the scalp, & keeps hair soft & supple, so strands won’t become brittle & break. It also boosts circulation, removes sebum build up, & unclogs hair follicles.

247 2018-12-27 23:37:53 Obama wanted to reduce those breaks - I doubt if that got anywhere. Trump wants to take away subsidies on renewables, still arguably emerging technology, but not oil & gas ... that's not remotely a "free market"

252 2018-12-27 23:36:31 Tell us again how Trudeau killed oil? By letting the PC party screw up consultations? By buying the pipeline so that the company wouldn’t shelve it? By personally driving down the price of Alberta oil? By extending EI benefits for people impacted? We’d like to know.
253 2018-12-27 23:36:18 I respectfully disagree.  @BernieSanders has a vision and a clear agenda as well as a spine.  @TheDemocrats just take cash  from private prisons and oil companies while they whine about the border and climate change.  What do Dems stand FOR?  Not just #resist ?
254 2018-12-27 23:36:14 I learnt that ethical oil is responsible for 110% of our GDP.

261 2018-12-27 23:35:53 For sure. Dark Money & 1% are tied to rich oil esp like Rosneft. & in USA this is the 1% that is controlling so much of our govt, Citz United, & other financial means. Big convo of late how to reg Citz United cuz SCOTUS won't rescind esp w Kav.
262 2018-12-27 23:35:47 We produce more oil than the entire EU put together by a factor of 5. I understand that it's not so simple as that blah blah blah but I don't know why oil is so relevant since we have far better relations with the big producers than the EU, who are on an anti US and SA drive.

274 2018-12-27 23:34:21 We need it to raise oil price
275 2018-12-27 23:34:18 When the ice cream melts inside their freezers watch the rich, the unprepared and the city dwellers en masse, starve. When the oil stops, the food will stop, when the food deliveries break down only the poorest will know how to survive. The middle classes will perish quickly.

283 2018-12-27 23:33:21 Came to get an oil change and they said they’re about to close  so much for being responsible
284 2018-12-27 23:33:15 When I fried up those mozerella sticks, I reignited the hot oil of war.
285 2018-12-27 23:33:08 Blah blah blah. Anyone with cancer or a loved one with cancer: get vitamin B17, Apricot seeds, CBD oil, take milk thistle for your liver. ASAP
286 2018-12-27 23:33:04 I have my oil diffuser, wax warmer, and wallflower on rn is that too much?
287 2018-12-27 23:32:51 Just don’t use the flavor packet, hot sauce, garlic, onion, salt, olive oil, and parsley and u got urself a broke boi dinner
288 2018-12-27 23:32:45 Keep up!!!
We are now the #1 producer of oil on the planet. Don't need their oil.
289 2018-12-27 23:32:34 did anyone else’s grandma make them smell eucalyptus oil when they were sick or was it just me
290 2018-12-27 23:32:23 Energy East was a disaster waiting to happen, as it was going to go past the great lakes, where a spill would contaminate drinking water for thousands of people! I'll put some dirty oil in a glass of water Martha, see if you'll drink it, bet you'll run for the hills if I did!
291 2018-12-27 23:32:19 Firefighters just leaving the oil and gasoline to soak into the ground, said no reporter ever.
292 2018-12-27 23:31:50 Um, no.  Man has been warring for the last 10k years for power. WWI wasn’t started over oil, but a complex system of international treaties that committed countries to war based on certain circumstances being met. WWII was Ideological (like Korea and Vietnam).
293 2018-12-27 23:31:41 @myheatworks model 3.  Almost 100% efficient.

Or get geothermal DC furnace that does hot water at 500% efficiency and 0 emission heat and cooling for way less than oil or propane (slightly less than Nat gas depending on electricity $$$)

Both will require wiring.
294 2018-12-27 23:31:25 Nothing to do killing cap and trade. Low prices are because of the oil market. If our lower prices were a result of killing cap and trade then why is the price of gas lower all over North America too?
295 2018-12-27 23:31:22 Whew. After having the week off and a stack of unedited videos to deal with, I've been burning the midnight oil since Christmas to get caught up.

Good news! I'm about 96% up to date!
296 2018-12-27 23:31:20 LSU doesn’t have the pieces that Alabama does. LSU’s network typically resembles the oil business. Alabama’s is more consistent and stable.
297 2018-12-27 23:31:19 Collective damage to Islam have come via Saudi cult. It will take time, as soon as the Oil burn off.
Just a waiting game for now.
298 2018-12-27 23:31:17 I think it’s goats milk soap. My soap dish always has like goats milk soap or Shea butter soap or olive oil soap or…

(Spouse hates how bad soap dries hands so soft soap type stuff is also always on my sink)
299 2018-12-27 23:31:09 Back to lighting lamps with whale oil? No thanks. The whales also say no.
300 2018-12-27 23:31:05 Q-uestion.
Are we going to pay back to the fed/ Rothschild  22 trillion worthless fed oil dollars. Which they cannot switch into goldbacked real dollar currency? At a face value of 1 cent to the dollar?   or is 220 billion overvalued.!

305 2018-12-27 23:30:26 @tanyadomi Oil fields as they age begin producing more gas. Certain ME Countries wanted to build a nat gas ppl through Syria and Turkey into Europe. Assad refused.  Russia's economy is based on the sale of natural resources. Take away gas sales to Europe and it will collapse
306 2018-12-27 23:30:25 Shale oil is going up again. Good gains for the stock market.
307 2018-12-27 23:30:15 Lmao for anyone who wants to do about two hours of research on CBD oil. Seems to be placebo effect. But if it works for ya! That’s great

312 2018-12-27 23:29:36 Oil companies are the only ones taking Houston seriously so ur prediction is most likely true 
313 2018-12-27 23:29:34 According to you, let’s send billions to all the other terrorist countries that we get oil from. I mean, it’s “their” money, right?

Thankfully Trump does opposite & defunds terrorism, pulls out of unnecessary conflicts & gets countries to pay us instead

315 2018-12-27 23:29:13 Oil Brent crude dropped 4.2%, at $52.16 a barrel and Light sweet crude ended 3.5% lower at $44.61 a barrel on @nymexwticrude
316 2018-12-27 23:29:13 It wasn't a lack of demand, it was price wars between Caribbean Star and LIAT that drove other airlines out of business, then rising oil prices meant one of them had to fold. LIAT has a monopoly now basically because CARICOM wants it to recover losses from that era.
317 2018-12-27 23:29:03 Ah, I had missed the announcement about the remaining heavy fuel oil being converted. Good for NYC.

319 2018-12-27 23:28:56 Service Engine Light has been on forever. Windshield wipers work but when you turn them off they stay in the up position. Traction off light is stuck on too. My dashboard lights are out. And now I need an oil change

322 2018-12-27 23:28:41 In the last 24 hrs there were a total of 9 oil product tankers in the ports of Quebec City and Montreal. Yet according to Quebec Premier François Legault, there is no social acceptability for oil in Quebec.

324 2018-12-27 23:28:27 You got any oil
325 2018-12-27 23:28:16 no way. women pump their own oil all the time. I’m mostly remarking about industry I guess. men dominate the automotive industry, as well as many others. if entire industries were to shut down worldwide for a day, we’d be in trouble, both long-term and short-term.
326 2018-12-27 23:28:08 #Rig #counts   USD 1,080, Canada 131, International 991. Historic context.

327 2018-12-27 23:28:05 Dont get me wrong im fine with the axe oil or serai scent oil when im sick. But when im not sick tht oil just gave me diarrhoea.
328 2018-12-27 23:28:02 Try some CBD oil marijuana extract! They have some specially for cats and dogs it might help. See I know something LOL
329 2018-12-27 23:27:58 Yes cutting it coconut oil and hair vitamins ! That’s been my hair aid so far
330 2018-12-27 23:27:42 In 15-20 yrs., our economy will be far less dependent on oil than now. Oil, gas, & coal companies are taking the wealth underneath our feet & hoarding it for themselves everytime they drill or mine.  A #CarbonFeeAndDividend would be great for the stock market.
331 2018-12-27 23:27:40 It won’t necessarily prevent them, but peppermint oil helps! If you put it on your temples and the back of your neck it’ll usually knock ‘em out.
332 2018-12-27 23:27:33 These are pre 2019 warning sings. Certainly its till May June it will be passed. And no one knows what oil will be like then. It could be high or low. Its volatile.
333 2018-12-27 23:27:29 見飽きた@道民
334 2018-12-27 23:27:26 Are you implying government control over gas prices? That would be big news for the oil industry
335 2018-12-27 23:27:20 That's great but I think I'll stick with bio oil
336 2018-12-27 23:27:19 I worked in a state doc in 2009 and contracted with Wyoming to house inmates from there bc they only had one prison. The oil field work etc led a lot of people there. Crime came with it.
337 2018-12-27 23:26:53 Snake oil salesmanship.  Few honest brokers in media.  Sensationalism sells.
338 2018-12-27 23:26:53 No we can’t. We troll tsla bulls on the internet, paid by the Koch Bros, Big Oil, Big Auto.
339 2018-12-27 23:26:40 Leslie, want to follow me? I have an oil price prediction of $34.54/bbl I would like to officially register by direct message... which requires you follow me. Thx for considering it.
340 2018-12-27 23:26:25 Trump should have Oval Office address.

347 2018-12-27 23:25:19 We don't have "heavy fuel oil" in New York City. I worked hard, with others, to ban it years ago. In any case, heat pumps are a fine replacement for oil heat. Oil heat replacement is most of the geothermal heat pump business today. Gas comes next.
348 2018-12-27 23:24:56 Couldn’t have anything to do with plunging oil prices could it.
349 2018-12-27 23:24:51 Donny needs more oil for his hair

353 2018-12-27 23:24:35 I've tried CBD oil (drops) as a sleep aid but it gave me wicked hypnic jerks which bothered me immensely so I stopped. Know many ppl tho who sleep much better with it.
354 2018-12-27 23:24:34 Soo. Yest dinner at macD. When in the Restaurant. Someone using the serai scent oil. Makes my stomach churns. Everytime i bite my burger the urge to poo is strong every minute. So yah 2 trips to the toilet because of tht smell 
355 2018-12-27 23:24:31 I remember the first and second ones. Markers sucked and dried out too fast. Crayons and colored pencils didn’t color. You lose the the glue or paper clips. The oil paints dried out as well or you lose some of them as well.
356 2018-12-27 23:24:29 Oil embargo. 
We could only get gas every other week.
No vehicles were allowed on the roads except emergency  vehicles. 
This was in the dead of winter. At the time I was living in Germany.
357 2018-12-27 23:24:27 Playing a musician after 4:30 PM who said, "I kill my own food, I plant my own crops, I change my own oil, I plant my own trees, and I cut my own firewood."  Any ideas on who it is?

361 2018-12-27 23:23:56 Oil prices fell amid thin trading volumes due to holiday season after biggest one-day increase in two-years on yesterday and fall again today 
362 2018-12-27 23:23:48 Friday I start oil preserving les chaises. Mais first I make patterns pour ta trone. The planer is now in the other side of garage where the chips blow outside. I'm serious.
363 2018-12-27 23:23:42 Yeah. Norweigan show on Netflix. Russia and the EU team up to push Norway's government to continue oil production and stop the Norweigan Green Party's push for 100% renewables.

the Truth is that we've been in an Oil & War economy for over 100 years and those forces don't want to change anytime soon. tho I think Trump is flawed (like us all) I am aware of what he is up against

375 2018-12-27 23:22:17 “Near-bear markets, however, are more common around technology transitions or one-time disruptions.” - how about the death of the combustion and oil with electrification and hydrogen on the horizon? That’s a seismic change.
376 2018-12-27 23:22:17 They don’t want the pipeline for one, they want to move it by rail...that won’t work, we take our oil(one of our biggest money makers)down south to be refined by the Americans and then ship it back up here...how does that make sense?

390 2018-12-27 23:20:54 Uh... no, that means the people who are paying YOU are clearly winning, obviously.

Shouldn't you then be trying to urge people to stop burning oil, in that case, rather than saying "give up, everybody! Give up!"? If you aren't getting paid to post this stuff, that is?

394 2018-12-27 23:20:27 It was this low about two years ago ....price is mostly market driven. When oil prices low and glut on market, prices drop. Nothing to do with cutting cap and trade portion... only four cents tops cut by scrapping it.
395 2018-12-27 23:20:23 Heat pumps are unsuitable for replacing heavy fuel oil boilers.
396 2018-12-27 23:20:10 Great piece.. and exactly how I feel about a carbon tax strategy.  Climate change is a global issue that requires a global response. Why not take $1 out of every barrel of global oil and invest in an international energy fund that invests in alternative energies/technologies?
397 2018-12-27 23:20:09 Follow the  follow the big corporations that helped Trump

418 2018-12-27 23:17:57 Agreed! Its all about Money game. #DavosInDesert conference was all about to divert eco things from oil to different other sectors. Asking foreign investors to come and be a part of MBS' #Vision2030 plan. Tail Khatam 
419 2018-12-27 23:17:50 Remember when Michelle Obama went to visit where the oil spill was in the Gulf of Mexico & work a shirt that looked like someone had flung a bucket of oil over it?  LOL
420 2018-12-27 23:17:48 So the Russians are pulling their troops out of foreign parts too, are they. You think isolationism is the answer. Let the Soviets in to control the area, control the oil and other assets. Good thinking. Make Putin rich again.........sorry I mean your boss!

424 2018-12-27 23:17:26 Since everyone is sick, I’m going to share some things that are important to me:

Ear Infections: Peroxide Rinse, followed by a few drops of coconut oil in the ears. Make sure to put cotton balls inside after. (I’m the  infection queen)

UTI’s: D-Mannose supplements every 3 hrs
425 2018-12-27 23:17:25 The people in charge continue getting paid. The pleb government employees lose their income.

We should stop paying politicians during a government shutdown.

427 2018-12-27 23:17:22 If you stopped invading oil rich countries the rest of the world would need a lot less protection!!
428 2018-12-27 23:17:20 on a side note does anyone have experiences with oil diffusers and are there any recommendations !! i really want to get one but im not sure which would be a good one to get
429 2018-12-27 23:17:18 Why does the USA, Venezuela and countless other countries sell the exact same oil product for 70 dollars a barrel while alberta sells it for 15.....at the coast its value jumps magically? Strange
430 2018-12-27 23:17:16 Chef Gusteau cut up some acne, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a dictionary, along with Silly Putty.

437 2018-12-27 23:16:38 cocoa butter & bio oil every day!! it takes time but worked for me!
438 2018-12-27 23:16:27 When your hubby makes sure the oil is changed, your gas tank is full and your tires are good to go before your little road trip  Swear my man goes over and beyond for me and the kids. He’s staying behind to work so we can enjoy ourselves AND that boys and girls is a manz MAN 
439 2018-12-27 23:16:26 Strip mining Chile for lithium to make your electric car battery is awesome for the environment!  And please explain why pipelines need a gender equity review but its ok to buy oil from Saudi Arabia with its track record on women, gay and human rights.
440 2018-12-27 23:16:19 Price of oil going down, time to start looking for another job

442 2018-12-27 23:16:06 If only Bernie would take money from Wall Street, big oil, offense contractors & drug insurance companies and stop trying to tax the super rich establishment. Then he could finally stop getting smeared for things the people actually want.
443 2018-12-27 23:15:59 I didn’t come here for debate. I mentioned my@dad healing his cancer. Once again I don’t have to be credible because I just don’t give enough fucks about you trolls. My dad beat cancer. For those who are struggling with cancer look into B17 and CBD oil!! Apricot seeds!!

445 2018-12-27 23:15:46 Telling you !!!!! Even McDonald’s overseas taste better .. I always thought it’s their oil 
446 2018-12-27 23:15:46 I am not kidding at all. They asked for money from Venezuela, home of planet earth’s least profitable oil company.
447 2018-12-27 23:15:40 Don’t even use the word in large part. You have had nothing to do with falling world oil prices or the fact there is a surplus of oil. Quit lying.
448 2018-12-27 23:15:39 تعالو ياولاد احكيلكم عن حاجة لطيفة بعملها لو حد بيعاني من أرق او بياخد وقت عشان ينام زي حالاتي كده.. حاجة جبتها بالصدفة اصلاً لاستعمالات اخرى.. essential oil لافندر من نفرتاري بتحط منه نقطة حرفياً علي ايدك او علي المخدة وتستمع بنوم هادئ حالم

452 2018-12-27 23:15:03 Where is the funding for the pipeline coming from? Also, do you know we've already built several other pipelines in Canada while not holding oil companies accountable for the cost of cleanup? They've already caused billions of dollars in damage. Whose paying for that?
453 2018-12-27 23:15:01 You are such a liar, Mr. Scheer, and I believe the Canadian public is smart enough to see through those lies. Go sell your snake oil somewhere else.
454 2018-12-27 23:14:58 The Canadian oil glut IS Ottawa’s fault. #Clueless.  3 major projects on table 4 years ago.  ALL ... ALL have been roadblocked by government.  Really, if the fucking liberals get out of the way and stop tripping up projects we just might get one or two built
455 2018-12-27 23:14:57 I need an oil change  tired of this shit 
456 2018-12-27 23:14:57 Your government is a  captive of the oil and gas industry.  Pity.  Try to make due with levels of production already in place.  Find something else to promote so that Canada can deal with its emissions reduction obligations. #climatechange #cdnpoli
457 2018-12-27 23:14:38 Yes wish beautiful Merry Christmas as well!
458 2018-12-27 23:14:36 And what do you propose?
More TFWs for big OIL?
Easier legislation for TFWs to be permanent residents?
Not once did you (conservatives)try and build a pipeline. You’re all talk and no action, just another politician lining up at the public purse.
459 2018-12-27 23:14:31 My hope is that canada can get our oil to the global market...make money as a nation and take a % of that to diversify.  Oil isnt sustainable in my mind but right now it is all we have to lean on.

462 2018-12-27 23:14:07 Oil painting is extremely easier for me I can’t even remotely paint anything with Acrylic. Once u learn all the mediums u can mix into the oil paint it’s a lot easier. It’s just a lot of product knowledge at first. Oil painting is so fun!

482 2018-12-27 23:12:39 Yup to tyres. And oil. And changing tap washers. Would need a semi set re jumpstarting. I'd just Google it.
It's vital we can all do these things.

485 2018-12-27 23:12:03 We don’t run the Canadian government, which is why we sell our oil to the U.S for $12 a barrel, and buy Saudi Oil for $60+.  I don’t think there’s a Canadian alive who thinks that’s good business. Merica has a bigger say on our politics than we do. We’re literally in left field.
486 2018-12-27 23:11:59 How does it take a dealership 3 hours to do an oil change and tire rotation?
487 2018-12-27 23:11:52 That's an exact speed  I'm imagining oil burning as they went whizzing past the caller.

554 2018-12-27 23:03:27 Canada pours close to 4 billion dollars each year into subsidizing oil industry — though it’s destroying our planetary life support system @JustinTrudeau @liberal_party #economyandinfrastructure @CBCNews
555 2018-12-27 23:03:16 I need a oil change 
556 2018-12-27 23:03:11 The production and delivery of oil products, natural gas and electricity in Canada contributes about $170 billion to Canada’s $1.8 trillion gross domestic product (GDP), or just under 10%.  The largest contributions are conventional oil and gas production (4%), oil sands (2%).

562 2018-12-27 23:02:25 Tell me Minister, which refineries outside the USA are lined up to take Alberta Heavy oil from TMX in Vancouver?
563 2018-12-27 23:02:16 .@mrlube I’m back, yet again. At this point I want a refund and be on my way. A week on and my car still indicates I need an oil change... #makeitright #letsmoveon – bij Mr. Lube

570 2018-12-27 23:01:04 And at this very moment I'm eating leftover Brussels Sprouts from Xmas. My brother in law makes a big pot, mixed with bacon and oil - so green and delicious!
571 2018-12-27 23:00:54 I already changed the . Alternator and belt .. So of course I can do a oil change
572 2018-12-27 23:00:39 Is oil painting “easier”? I know painting isn’t easy but I did a portrait in acrylic and it was harder than I expected when I got to his face because things would dry before I was done. Especially my already mixed colors which was the most frustrating for me.

USA is oil self sufficient so the only thing they need to do in the Middle East is keep Israel armed to the teeth. That is @realDonaldTrump plan.
576 2018-12-27 22:59:49 Farrell Flournoy @FLOURNOYFarrell Saudis have been plotted a war with Iran for over 8 yrs. Why? Iran has more oil than the Saudis. IRAQ has a predominant SHIITE population. Saudi Arabia, also predominately Shiite wants Iran's untapped oil reserves.
577 2018-12-27 22:59:44 I want to move to Racine just so I can read The Times with my black coffee and CBD oil.
578 2018-12-27 22:59:39 Pretty much everyone in Norway is a millionaire.  They don't have much to spend it on and all they have in Norway is snow, oil and fish. Denmark is having a crisis while pretending not to have a crisis rapidly shutting down all social programs. Sweden is a no go zone.

580 2018-12-27 22:59:36 ME TOO it saves my life when my skin’s acting up. and my skin is relatively oily so it doesn’t break me out more or make me look like an oil slick.
581 2018-12-27 22:59:28 @fordnation Doug..... stop lying.  Crude oil prices are down!
582 2018-12-27 22:59:25 Baby Drove An Hour To Get My Oil Changed Like I Cant Even 
583 2018-12-27 22:59:20 Idiot oil is the main source and it limdmof went down
584 2018-12-27 22:59:10 @KGNissanSLC spent an hour in waiting room for an oil change. Still no one to work on it. So much for express service lane. #pathetic
585 2018-12-27 22:58:54 It’s true in law of attraction. Speak and say things and it becomes a reality. It becomes the truth if you say what you want. Today my dumb-ass held a bucket of chili oil and said “what if I drop this” and 4 seconds later I dropped it.  Have a good day y’all
586 2018-12-27 22:58:51 A 12 year old girl just walked up to me at Ulta and said “I have to tell you something,” then proceeded to show me that she stuck her entire hand in a wax pot and couldn’t get the wax off. I just spent 10 minutes scrubbing her hand with oil. How’s your day going

589 2018-12-27 22:58:31 Gas prices are low because the price of oil is low, no other reason
590 2018-12-27 22:58:26 My face wash is from @LaRochePosayUSA my essence is from @Kiehls My night oil is the rose squalane oil from @Biossance and my eye gel cream comes from them too. And then my moisturizer is from @skynICELAND
591 2018-12-27 22:58:11 Sadly we blew up their homes ‘protecting them’ and guarding our oil, which somehow found itself under their land
592 2018-12-27 22:57:47 Oil is carcinogenic.

598 2018-12-27 22:57:04 i would say Yes if u have super chapped lips bc the oil + scrubby textured applicator just Saved My Life in like 20 minutes BUT i would get the nontinted one bc now i have a little clown ring around my mouth
599 2018-12-27 22:56:59 the whole mystique relies on the idea that you were parked in front of 6 monitors, talking to oil traders on one phone and Long/Short guys on another phone, all simultaneously. Couch and leftovers shatters it.
600 2018-12-27 22:56:46 Its a balancing act for Saudi, and that approach turned out to be a massive fail for them as the independent USA shale producers (which is who Saudi were trying to crash out) can turn on and off relatively flexibly.   $100+ oil was bad news for the world & now history
601 2018-12-27 22:56:43 Did you find an engine in the oil pan?
602 2018-12-27 22:56:31 Prayer For Salvation:

603 2018-12-27 22:56:30 Things the Premier SHOULD know
 1) Ontario has never had a carbon tax
 2)  that prices right across North America are down due to the drop on oil prices 
3) that even his base can google this information 
4) that thanks to cancelling Cap & Trade we will have a Carbon Tax
604 2018-12-27 22:56:18 Remember that time you thought it was a good idea to pour scalding hot oil all over your micropenis?  Good times.
605 2018-12-27 22:56:15 Bet you can’t guess what contractors we had working in Kuwait drilling oil before Desert Storm?
606 2018-12-27 22:56:12 Here’s tea.
-witch hazel with rose water  
- a moisturing gel like hydrolonic acid or glycolic acid 
- moisturizing crème/ oil (i use shea butter)
- add anything else you would like 
- cleanser is very skin dependent

616 2018-12-27 22:55:12 Trump waxing it on pretty fantastic, troops have never had to deal with a snake oil salesman of the 21st century. Congress has the power to immediately remove Trump from office, but neither side can put their petty party antics aside long enough to do their fucken jobs.
617 2018-12-27 22:55:07 How tf I managed to mix up honey and olive oil?
618 2018-12-27 22:55:06 United States has been stealing Mexican's oil for decades and now by purchasing it through criminals and cartels. The government of Mexico is currently suing a couple of Texas oil companies for purchasing Mexican oil in the black market. Shame on them!!! #amlo #mexico

623 2018-12-27 22:54:45 the saviour of 2018 was the body shop's tea tree oil, thank you for making my skin almost flawless
624 2018-12-27 22:54:44 Eeek stop using plastic bags

Meanwhile, giant Oil Companies, burn off gas in oil fields.

With no regard for the health or safety of neighbouring communities. Contributing dramatically to Global Warming. 
625 2018-12-27 22:54:38 Just heard on global news cost of gas is due to slumping world oil prices and we should expect them to go back up this weekend.  Are you prepared to own the increase as well?
626 2018-12-27 22:54:35 Absolutely spot on.  It's terrible how there is such terrible truffle oil that is used everywhere now and people don't know the difference.
627 2018-12-27 22:54:30 lol if's and buts ! without oil money man city would probably be in league 2. yeah it could still wrong for us, but this BS  from other fans is pretty desperate.

633 2018-12-27 22:54:04 We already have people driving around without doing oil changes and tire replacements. Elon is your God but don't expect us to take everything he says as gospel. Patrick is emotional at times but one day he will grow up and become an adult. 
634 2018-12-27 22:54:03 I purchased some ylang ylang oil today.
635 2018-12-27 22:54:03 idk if i had a stroke while at work but i could’ve sworn this lady told me she drank essential oil and wanted a metal straw cause the oil damages plastic

637 2018-12-27 22:53:50 Just like I believe HW was a good guy. Cheney on the other hand! 
Desert Storm-Kuwait was slant drilling into Iraqi Oil. Saddam told Kuwait to knock it off. They didn’t and Saddam attacked.
That’s not how history tells it? Is it?

642 2018-12-27 22:53:05 If TR attacks he can pick up the scraps, which are the oil fields and most of the ypk/pkk held lands, for free without any agreement. If he makes an agreement on the other hand he'll get a very angry TR completly remotivated in removing him after basically accepting him to stay.
643 2018-12-27 22:52:58 The Federal government defended the pipeline for years, well before Trudeau came to office. Harper couldn’t do it and Trudeau can’t either. It’s the inferior oil that must be sold at a loss on a glutted market that will thankfully force Albertans to abandon the oilpatch.
644 2018-12-27 22:52:53 Ah, we are producing the MOST oil now...so, guess you folks are out of luck then.

657 2018-12-27 22:51:12 Except pledge Beto signed included not taking money from oil executives, which Beto did.  That's why he was removed from the pledge.  I'm sure John knows this but he's not an honest broker.

665 2018-12-27 22:50:39 Should ask the liar why Labour's Brian Wilson repeatedly lied to folk throughout the 80s & 90s by telling them the oil will "run out in 20-years time". As we all know, it hasn't and not only that but we are finding brand new supplies estimated to last at least 50-years.

669 2018-12-27 22:50:24 Yeah.
Turkey does cope a lot though, even their president does it.
They constantly threaten greece and send war planes "by mistake" over greece's land, they try to scare the oil rigs away. They basically have no territory on the Mediterranean, nor islands, so no oil either

685 2018-12-27 22:48:36 The same thing happened to my wife at an oil change place. We called management and sent them screenshots. That dude got fired real quick.
686 2018-12-27 22:48:34 Love ya dude but they were asking women this question. Plus, are you saying women can’t pump their own gas or change their own oil?

(add sm. amount of sea salt, garlic, olive oil, red onion, and crushed red pepper to taste)
692 2018-12-27 22:47:58 Let me assist!  I do them all the time.  Cut them in half.  Make sure they are coated in olive oil, garlic powder, salt/pepper, add some fresh garlic about the last two minutes (otherwise it burns). I have also had good success marinating them for a few hours in any marinade
693 2018-12-27 22:47:36 Do you not believe that us being landlocked for the majority does not result in us recieving a lower $ value?  Why are the Americans able to make huge profits from purchasing our oil?  Is it refineries that we need? Maybe the 4.5 billion should have been spent on that?
694 2018-12-27 22:47:31 Oh Donnie, more snake oil. Democrats want border security. They don't want your vanity wall project. To go even further, EVERYONE wants you to have the wall...as long as you keep YOUR promise that Mexico would pay for it (and not indirectly like you keep suggesting.)
695 2018-12-27 22:47:30 NFC’s AMMODOGS became only OIL team to go 0-13.
696 2018-12-27 22:47:27 Tea tree oil apparently makes your hair super luscious, if you want that.
697 2018-12-27 22:47:14 The "Hold My Beer: Florida Edition" is supported by the oil refineries, fireworks commission, and meth cookers everywhere.

715 2018-12-27 22:45:09 If anyone wants a job in Texas I have the hookup on a few oil related jobs!
716 2018-12-27 22:45:06 Sure, so distortions already exist and we (the US) can’t do away with all of them. We could at least start by ending fossil fuel subsidies and charge oil and gas for their negative externalities.
717 2018-12-27 22:44:57 Ion call it shining bitch i call it oil sheening 
718 2018-12-27 22:44:55 Make no mistake about it. We love our troops. They are our flesh and blood. What we hate is the cabal's continual wars and proxy wars for their oil, gas, uranium, and drug pay to play. End the pay to play plunder and that will end the wars by the cabal for power and profit.

721 2018-12-27 22:44:29 In Alberta they are called rig rockets as the drivers often work on the oil rigs and drive recklessly.
722 2018-12-27 22:44:27 Very funny. Maybe you should search to know were ikwerre L.G.A is located.. Maybeyou need know that the oil your state enjoy comes from there.. Maybe like you said all nigerians can't be touch
723 2018-12-27 22:44:17 For folk who claim they’re not the enemy of the American people, a whole lot of the American people seem to be their enemies.

725 2018-12-27 22:44:12 Oil companies are very powerful
726 2018-12-27 22:44:01 I had somehow started receiving emails from the trump teams. 5 or 6 times a day! Took me weeks to get rid of them. Plus, they also send your email to Snake oil sales people who take even longer to dump. I can only imagine what “their” people buy and give!
727 2018-12-27 22:44:01 Coconut oil is "pure poison," but coconut milk is great for cooking. OK!

737 2018-12-27 22:42:38 Whoever thought to batter chicken and fry it in oil should win the Nobel prize for chemistry.
738 2018-12-27 22:42:22 What, wait.... legacy media told us that is was "climate change", and that the only way to stop it was to pay more in taxes and not to use Canadian oil, only foreign under-regulated oil.
739 2018-12-27 22:42:20 Bruh I love my oil diffuser my room be smelling hella good lol

742 2018-12-27 22:41:44 We subsidize all your friends. Coal, pharma,oil, tech, farm. When I say farm lets be serious. Monsanto...
743 2018-12-27 22:41:06 Good boy...or girl....
744 2018-12-27 22:41:01 Ermm that would be called a 'competive market' for oil.... $40-60/bbl is not ridiculous... Having your bulging socialist state budget dependent on holding the rest of the world to ransom with $100+ crude is...
745 2018-12-27 22:40:53 "Merry belated Christmas! I got you a present.

It's chocolate, a bottle of oil, and my rock-hard cock!"

747 2018-12-27 22:40:37 I worked in product development for a well known pizza delivery chain - I would never touch one again as long as I live. All that dough and oil is disgusting. Basically its a loaf of fried bread with tomato concentrate and fake cheese. 
748 2018-12-27 22:40:37 Unionists for you.

754 2018-12-27 22:39:55 Tell farmers no more subsidies, add big oil, pharma and war mongering companies no more also... I too am a Corporation.
755 2018-12-27 22:39:52 Russia needs higher oil prices and will gladly work with Saudi Arabia to get them, things like the killing of Khashoggi won't bother Vladimir Putin,  whose agents have carried out killings for him also, Putin does not worry about ethics or decency
756 2018-12-27 22:39:46 Someone PLEASE POINT OUT that Trump is a multi-millionaire and HAS NO clue of what it’s like to worry about losing your home,starving, not being able buy heating oil in winter , and buy toys for your kids all because a RICH man wants to grandstand for the sake of his own ego!
757 2018-12-27 22:39:46 たのしみだ〜！
758 2018-12-27 22:39:38 An hour and forty minutes for an oil change seems to be a bit much.
759 2018-12-27 22:39:21 Hes a schill for the oil and gas industry, that's what hes doing now.
760 2018-12-27 22:39:12 How does a great artiste like @phynofino put in so much work to keep up His relevance in the industry dropping very lovely/popular songs (N.W.A, Fuwa, Oil, Onye-Oma, Isi Ego). Then one @JoeyAkan comes and undermines all of that work by fallaciously and disrespectfully stating...
761 2018-12-27 22:39:09 2 mill
762 2018-12-27 22:39:09 That's not true.  The market just went up today and Luke any other market it goes up and down.  Oil prices are way down.  As far as the the two children the 9ne little girl had not eaten in 7 days or had anything to drink.  We did try to take care of them but sadly it was toolate
763 2018-12-27 22:39:06 The new Titan XD, for sure is better than the Tundra becuz Cummins Turbo Diesel... 550 ft-lbs torque, 300 HP. But my Titan went 220k miles on ORIGINAL brakes. I had to drive the service guy to replace them. Nothing but oil changes and regular tune ups...

767 2018-12-27 22:38:37 Bro that’s 75% oil & the rest is cheese. It’s OD 
768 2018-12-27 22:38:35 I bet the Koch brothers put this together. Why would they want to stop progress? Change probably includes climate change meaning less oil profits and regulations. Pollution control means major change to product burn off. A tax or fee towards tons of carbon release.
769 2018-12-27 22:38:30 5-8 is always the default but the long 8/10 hour commission is random and only assigned a new one after you complete one for 1000 to 1200 oil.
770 2018-12-27 22:38:21 Houston.  Saw the Moody Blues, Neil Diamond, Kris Kristopherson n Rita Coolidge,  worked in oil & gas part time at Astrodome as a "Spacette"  then came disco followed by Mikey Gilley's Urban Cowboy.  (sigh) Saw Houston become so diversified - ppl from all over the world- awesome!
771 2018-12-27 22:38:20 not much harm done honestly we don’t even have a EPA anymore Trump has turned it into the Oil and gas protection agency

775 2018-12-27 22:37:56 As if Liverpool Football Club would loan an £45m asset to oil rich, financial doping billionaires in the first place. 

He was always going to be a slow burner and introduced gradually. Nothing that’s happened should surprise anyone. Unless your name is @mattspiro that is!

785 2018-12-27 22:36:49 I decided I was going to be healthier this year so I bought lemons, a water bottle, biotin, and fish oil pills . . . The total was $42.78 . . . Pizza and candy never did me dirty like that.
786 2018-12-27 22:36:36 if big oil wasn't behind #climate alarm they could push it aside, they haven't even tried? So your logic is missing a big chunk.
787 2018-12-27 22:36:35 Boutta say fuck electric cars and buy a 4 rotor rx7 and burn mad oil and gas
788 2018-12-27 22:36:34 Do you know how to live without twitter and baby oil ?
789 2018-12-27 22:36:33 And  this is on a Christmas week of heavy travel? Wow. Commodities and oil do not lie. Equities do. Data continues to shit out to the negative versus 2 days of hard buying. It'll settle sometime soon.
790 2018-12-27 22:36:27 U need anointing oil
791 2018-12-27 22:36:23 You protect the free world that has oil
792 2018-12-27 22:36:19 Chavez subsidized most commodities to win support of the masses, but that required oil tb be near $100. When oil prices fell no longer had money to subsidize but price controls (below cost of production) remained, so production ground to a halt
793 2018-12-27 22:36:17 Swear cause I never knew lol.. come with me tomorrow to get my oil changed lol
794 2018-12-27 22:36:06 Thank you Jeff! Maybe you could rub some oil on me to make me look even more muscular? Or would that give you a count country boner?

796 2018-12-27 22:35:58 I read it too and was disappointed it completely ignored the 07-08 run up in oil in expectation the FED would print and when they didnt oil collapsed
797 2018-12-27 22:35:53 When I see people eating snacks from certain companies Ize wanna be like “those people destroying orangutan habitats for palm oil & you complicit if you support them” but I also don’t wanna be that person  please as a consumer be aware of who you support
798 2018-12-27 22:35:51 Oil prices are not down because of the carbon tax. You look dumber than the people you're trying to fool.
Government for the "WEALTHY" People.
799 2018-12-27 22:35:47 Oil, tires, washer fluid, radiator fluid, tires, yup. Grandpa wanted to know his girl was fully capable of taking care of herself & wouldn’t be helpless to traditionally male tasks.
800 2018-12-27 22:35:43 @richardsyrett , what oil do you use when you get sick ... you talked about it on a podcast and I can’t find it ...

809 2018-12-27 22:34:26 Completely missing your point, I know, but CBD oil does nothing for me. I think it's the current snake oil.

816 2018-12-27 22:33:20 I get you don't mind the oil and gas compromise. I do. Dems do. You're good with Beto voting to deregulate banks? Is there any issue where you'd be really mad at a candidate having voted poorly on?
817 2018-12-27 22:33:17 Even if peanut oil were ever to be used in vaccines - it never will because it's not needed - but if it were, #vaccine manufacturers would employ highly-refined oil. Highly-refined peanut oil doesn't contain the proteins that trigger peanut allergy

819 2018-12-27 22:32:54 Give me one example of an oil subsidy.
820 2018-12-27 22:32:46 Last night a guy told me about all the different ways he has scammed his way through piss tests to work in the oil field. I told him about how sometimes I pee sitting down because my penis is feeling rambunctious.
821 2018-12-27 22:32:43 Phyno dropped fuwa sewa, best rap song this yr. dropper oil, n.w.a, once chance, iyilu Ife, and so many more. Just cos he didn’t do concert in lag equals a bad yr? U are joking come to cathedral and see ppl
822 2018-12-27 22:32:39 Pretty soon it won’t be a differential price problem it will be an oil price problem period.
823 2018-12-27 22:32:32 I put ylang ylang oil into my diffuser and i feel like i am one with the sky rn
824 2018-12-27 22:32:32 You won’t be invested to see it heid, too much trading you’ll get caught out in the end haha
825 2018-12-27 22:32:22 Myth! The world's awash with oil! Only the cheapest stuff to extract is gradually running out. The truth is that climate change means we will have to stop using fossil fuels while the Earth is still heaving with the stuff. "The stone age didn't end due to a lack of stone."

831 2018-12-27 22:31:52 Teach him the masculine arts:

1. Build a fire & cook over it. The meat must be fish he caught or game he killed.
2. Spend a day where he opens doors for ladies. Repeat until it's a habit.
3. Teach him how to change a tire & oil.
4. Take him clothes shopping.
5. Present man card.

How will my oil-lies be this time next year ?
836 2018-12-27 22:31:17 @MicheleDupey I'm not an oil patch person, only covered as an analyst. My understanding is you have nat gas and methane coming up with oil. If you have no pipeline/containment on site, you must flare it or it can explode.

838 2018-12-27 22:31:01 @mrbinnion So when will the Transmountain pipeline be under construction? The longer the delay means that Japan, Korea and China have zero interest in buying Canadian oil.

841 2018-12-27 22:30:25 oil of oregano! put a few drops in ur tea, it helps!
842 2018-12-27 22:30:19 OKAY! do you boil them a day in advance and let them dry out over night. Then you dust them in flour, 2 tablespoons so theres a light covering. Add any herbs or spices you want now.

THEN! put oil in a roasting pan, heat it up until it sizzles (400 should do it) then cook potatoe
843 2018-12-27 22:30:02 omg NOOOOOO go eat garlic rn and get some oregano oil
844 2018-12-27 22:29:58 Ok and your point. Who are the largest consumers of oil. I’m gonna need you to look beyond your little space.
845 2018-12-27 22:29:56 dont know if its still my vaseline on my lips or the oil from the food i just ate
846 2018-12-27 22:29:45 Hot tip: when you’re in grief and people say “if there’s anything I can do to help” take them up on it - need your oil changed? Have them do it. Been putting off your taxes? Doesn’t hurt to ask. Got a room in your house that needs organizing? Hey, they said anything.
847 2018-12-27 22:29:14 OPEN YOUR HEART TO THE SNAKE OIL PEDDLERS
848 2018-12-27 22:29:11 Neither the site with the RFKJr article or one refuting his pipeline narrative are sites I’ve ever seen so maybe I need to research it more. It wouldn’t surprise me if there were oil interests intersecting in the civil war but it seems ludicrous to assert that’s the root cause
849 2018-12-27 22:29:06 Does @TheBodyShopUK gentle eye make up remover have oil in it?
850 2018-12-27 22:29:02 Oil they your head
851 2018-12-27 22:28:58 wow so I’ve been wanting an oil pen for GOD knows how long. the other night, found one at the bar. next day, a girl i know messaged me asking if I did have it, could return it. saw the message this morning, replied & she said “bought a new one today, you can keep it”. I AM CRYING
852 2018-12-27 22:28:46 Respectfully disagree. Because he was quieter & a 4-year president, he’s often left out of discussions on “best” presidents, but he founded Depts of Energy & Education (& doubled Edu budget), tangibly worked to end US dependency on oil, & walked the walk as he talked the talk.
853 2018-12-27 22:28:37 Drives me crazy.  I’ve read some of the silliest “fulfillments” of biblical prophecy.  My favorite is the BP Gulf Oil spill, that it was somehow specifically prophetic..
854 2018-12-27 22:28:37 Where did Putin get his money to buy oil fields and an island near Venzuela. Hillary Clinton? Ha Ha
855 2018-12-27 22:28:33 Tweets saying big build. What were the numbers? Thought the oil glut would turn to a gasoline glut a while ago
856 2018-12-27 22:28:31 cont.

857 2018-12-27 22:28:23 Yves wiped the oil off her hands in the distance.

863 2018-12-27 22:28:04 Ha ha ha, can I "as a negibor of those countries" ask a question? Years ago, did we send USA  an invitation for coming here ? Or you sniff the oil and send troops?

You should have a brief conversation with George Bush old boy, they didn't told you the whole story man.
864 2018-12-27 22:27:36 I know you don’t really track oil related stocks but I would like to have your chart analysis and opinion on the ticker $CIM if possible. Would greatly appreciate it!
865 2018-12-27 22:27:35 Why do people that work at oil change stores always look at you like, “why are you here?”
866 2018-12-27 22:27:29 Cathleen, I have many friends from many walks of life. Some own their own businesses, some work in public services, a few in the gas/oil ind. All used to support labour, none do now & they all say JC is the reason. Has to change as he will cast #labour in to the wilderness.
867 2018-12-27 22:27:26 for spot treatments you can use,
apple cider vinegar
take a zinc supplement 
make a honey and cinnamon mask
tea tree oil
apply green tea
apply witch hazel
moisturize with aloe vera
868 2018-12-27 22:27:16 They have the damn nerve to say he's olive oil and Middle eastern (which is actually Northeast Africa, little do they know)

They're scared to say he's black.
869 2018-12-27 22:27:12 That nigga had no oil in his car at all.
870 2018-12-27 22:27:05  The hubby came from the store with several bottles of shea butter, coco butter, coconut oil, etc and says "you got to oil down like you did the last time you were pregnant to avoid the stretchmarks" and proceeds to oil me down to show me how I did last time. #icant
871 2018-12-27 22:27:03 Well...Twitter version...Saudi Arabia in conjunction with USA flooded the market with cheap oil, forcing the price down to ridiculous levels. Venezuela-oil rich- has lost billions in state budget due to the drop in price and so inflation has sky rocketed.
872 2018-12-27 22:26:57 Cantu deep conditioner, Cantu shampoo, pepper mint oil (scientifically proven to grow hair)
873 2018-12-27 22:26:55 Lol. Person when call himself engine oil? File fun!
874 2018-12-27 22:26:49 Spilled 350 degree fry oil all over my legs and got yelled at by customers all day so that’s how my days going
875 2018-12-27 22:26:49 Dear @BWWings last night I had a rather painful allergic reaction to your garlic parmigiana wings. Why do you need sesame oil in that. Its more Italian to use olive oil. Shame on you
876 2018-12-27 22:26:37 When it becomes federally legal with the next Dem Prez the price will drop. I live in FL where MM oil has been approved for me, encouraged even. I went online and looked at nearby shops. Pricey. I live on a budget.
877 2018-12-27 22:26:36 Ok so what you need to do at this point is rub coconut oil on it because that fixes everything, and then try turning it off and turning it on again using the manwell
878 2018-12-27 22:26:33 I’m sorry you lost your iPhone! That’s awful! Glad you made it home safely though and are benefiting from the fish oil. Have a great remainder of 2018!
879 2018-12-27 22:26:26 It’s America who always wants to go fight in other people country and regions because America don’t want a war fought on her soil and it comes with a price in money and manpower. Our greed for oil have us stuck in the Mideast unending wars n our support for apartheid Israel also
880 2018-12-27 22:26:20 It will come quick as fire spreading on oil!
881 2018-12-27 22:26:05 whoop dee do...he spent 1 hour conducting a campaign rally and lying to the troops about a raise..BFD...BTW how much snake oil did you buy?
882 2018-12-27 22:26:02 You think Miek be using coconut oil?
883 2018-12-27 22:25:52 Trump is the idiot, corrupt  front man for the corrupt masterminds behind this and past obstruction of climate, pollution regulations.Oil, chemical Corporations and their complicit financiers are the real criminals
884 2018-12-27 22:25:48 Dean on a Wisconsin WR is like Oil on Vinegar.
885 2018-12-27 22:25:28 oh totally lol, that’s why i never did them for myself!! they’re also lowkey high maintenance bc no oil or liquid eyeliner is allowed near them cuz they’ll fall out  it’ll be fun for a one time thing to feel all pretty but i don’t think i can afford to redo them constantly
886 2018-12-27 22:25:25 I entered my friend's(a boy) room this morning and right on his table I found blue band, mayonnaise, pears, Venus, baby oil, 150 naira bread(with a hole in the middle). I have been wondering what could be the cause of these combinations on his table.
887 2018-12-27 22:25:21 "The Financial Times excitedly proclaimed that “Mexico’s historic vote to open its oil and gas sector to private investment after 75 years yoked to the state is a political coup for Enrique Peña Nieto.”
888 2018-12-27 22:25:14 Bollocks of course its primeraly,a  pipeline war for gas and oil. However its geographical position could also be of particular existential/occult interest to those with interest in religous or other worldly "conspiracy theories" related to ancient extra terrestrial visitations
889 2018-12-27 22:25:11 lmfao!!!! dammit!!!!! contemplating going to get an oil change and gettin uber to nail salon
890 2018-12-27 22:25:10 Today, a FB friend of many years standing has now asked whether I've tried CBD oil...Why do folks not realise that if one has pain etc, you'll probably have googled a million things and tried most of them rather than live with pain? I know folks mean well & kindly but, really??
891 2018-12-27 22:24:57 William I see yr argument, that there isn't a viable alternative, yet China & CNY is exiting USD . I heard the Chinese acquired a port in Kenya (with which to do trade) + CNY oil futures contract. The RMS Titanic (of currencies aka USD ) alas is going down, & many will "Drown"
892 2018-12-27 22:24:54 Lavender and jojoba oil bath
893 2018-12-27 22:24:49 Literally same I have a carrot cake with hash oil in it
894 2018-12-27 22:24:43 Get well soon, ta may Chicken Oil na sa Inasal..
895 2018-12-27 22:24:43 I always drag my guy friends to get an oil change with me but I had to go by myself today 
896 2018-12-27 22:24:37 Oh yeah...the SA oil embargo where you sat for a long time to get 5 gallons of gas.
Good times.
897 2018-12-27 22:24:36 and of course, today, a FB friend of many years standing has now asked whether I've tried CBD oil...Why do folks not realise that if one has pain etc, you'll probably have googled a million things and tried most of them rather than live with pain?
898 2018-12-27 22:24:34 An empty pot won't have any food in it no matter how long it stays on fire. Or will it?
899 2018-12-27 22:24:31 peppermint oil on the temples always helped me, and a cold cloth on the back of your neck
900 2018-12-27 22:24:29 He would have been right about the second if we had voted for Independence in 79, or the Tory Government from that year hadn't stolen all our oil. #indyref2
901 2018-12-27 22:24:14 Cbd oil makes everything better, man.
902 2018-12-27 22:24:11 I might need an oil for this trip idk
903 2018-12-27 22:24:09 Not gonna happen... Oil conglomerates will stop it... They lobby the governments ... Money not oil runs the show
904 2018-12-27 22:24:04 I'm all for applying pressure to Saudi for its war crimes, but unless you're focussing on #Saudi #oil I don't really see the point of a #boycott. Oil is where they make 90% of their export earnings.
905 2018-12-27 22:23:59 There is a simple policy-based solution for this: Appropriate fee (per hr better than per kWh), penalty ($6 hr past 2-6 hrs or if charge complete) and/or fines (parking ticket if not plugged in). Do these & 90%+ PHEVs will move along. Remember: EV miles agnostically displace oil.
906 2018-12-27 22:23:52 Do you not think that has already begun. McDavid can only do so much.  Zero depth
907 2018-12-27 22:23:38 Hahahaha oil n gas ke hhaha

910 2018-12-27 22:23:04 ゴットフリートさん出ない
911 2018-12-27 22:23:03 He forgot that by putting tariffs on China before hand he lost negotiating power. Plus he threatened japan and South Korea with tariffs because they received oil from Iran and didn’t figure out an alternative fast enough after the US removed itself and decided to punish those
912 2018-12-27 22:23:01 Personal relationships and business don’t mix it’s like oil and water
913 2018-12-27 22:23:00 My white girl gifted me AirPods, Argon oil and a Tech Fleece... she tryna ostracize me from the nigga community
914 2018-12-27 22:22:57 Well one of the farmer is ex director Indian oil and also Aap member.
915 2018-12-27 22:22:55 Just 2 weeks ago scientist admitted to incorrect data, because testing was done wrong, and now here we are again. I know 2 things for certain, BC and Quebec still dump raw sewage in the ocean, and Quebec still buys Saudi oil.
916 2018-12-27 22:22:49 U need some OIL den some PRAYers before we take u down to ANI ebe aga emegi IWA ibewezie ka NWA egosi ISI EGO den u FUWAaaa....... All respect to @phynofino d Playmaker
917 2018-12-27 22:22:18 ありがとうございます。
まさかまさかでした。
918 2018-12-27 22:22:16 Every time I take my car in to get an oil change I always worry it will cost me $100. Yet it always ends up being $35 or so.
919 2018-12-27 22:22:14 No it bloodly doesn’t have anything to do with your politics. Do you even *get* the concept of the spot oil market or the failure of OPEC to restrict its own members from over supply? I don’t even think your mouth breathing supporters in central Etobicoke buy this crap. #Bullshit
920 2018-12-27 22:22:06 Can be used to light an oil lamp in a pinch though!
921 2018-12-27 22:21:59 Brand New makes olive oil?!?!
922 2018-12-27 22:21:54 ほられた（？？？
923 2018-12-27 22:21:42 But what if they can’t and the bad guys get all the oil Donny?
924 2018-12-27 22:21:37 For the uninformed - our new shale technology & other new petrochemical advances have scared hell out of the criminal Saudis & bastard OPEC - they are trying to stop our development by flooding world markets with cheap oil, so low it stops our domestic industry- that’s their plan
925 2018-12-27 22:21:30 But you don't let no-one tell you do you spence?
You're not some shallow oil/motor lobby dupe are you?
You don't fall for the car ads....!!
Your smart enough to decide eh! 

You absorb the information. You respond accordingly.
Well done you!

No really...
926 2018-12-27 22:21:26 Looks more like one in 17 to me.  Oil's been nearly only about sentiment for a while now anyway.
927 2018-12-27 22:21:14 オリーブ油で毎日を楽しく(*^_^*)
928 2018-12-27 22:20:54 I believe that's the article I used to pull my numbers lol.

They count animals that were hurt as well aka covered in oil

I had to look at a few other sources to get just the death toll numbers.
929 2018-12-27 22:20:45 my favourite is the clinique "take the day off cleanser" its a balm that is miraculous!!! but its a little expensive, i also like natural ones like coconut oil and i like drugstore micellar water from any brand (garnier, simple, etc) that are good for sensitive skin

931 2018-12-27 22:20:24 Silicone is the new Oil

933 2018-12-27 22:20:01 It says that 100% of all natural resources revenue counted in the formula EXCEPT Alberta oil. In 2007, it was raised to 50%. So you're complaining Alberta gets a sweet deal?
934 2018-12-27 22:20:00 I'm intrigued for you to educate us on the USAs anti-competitve practices against Venezuela on the global oil markets though...
935 2018-12-27 22:19:59 Bruh, 2019 is about having "the oil".
936 2018-12-27 22:19:58 LUA eye oil
937 2018-12-27 22:19:56 You only need your oil changed every 3000 miles jayla 
938 2018-12-27 22:19:56 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
939 2018-12-27 22:19:47 I don't want to dump wind power.

I simply want to not use it until they can make it better.

If they can't make it better then we can use solar off they can improve to be better than oil

I just want to use the best solution.
940 2018-12-27 22:19:47 Honda's Maintenance Minder computer actually measures amount of engine load, temperature, mileage, rpm, etc to calculate how much oil life is left. It also calculates things like tire rotation, time to tune up, and tells you what services need to be done.
941 2018-12-27 22:19:40 oil below $46. everyone beware.
942 2018-12-27 22:19:37 はい！思いっきり楽しみたいと思います！！

売れ数は気にしない方針で…ｗ
943 2018-12-27 22:19:33 Saudi Arabia controls the price of oil; elimination of the Carbon Tax had nothing to do with it. Low price of oil isn't good for Canadian oil.
944 2018-12-27 22:19:24 Of course I also remember him (fondly) for the time he mistakenly treated my cold symptoms with an eyedropper of cod liver oil (that our puppy was getting) instead of nose drops!
945 2018-12-27 22:19:22 جزاكم الله خيرا .
946 2018-12-27 22:19:19 @JNJNews  can y’all just bring back the Aloe and Vitamin E Creamy Baby Oil? We still have mosquitoes in Texas at the end of December and need some help.
947 2018-12-27 22:19:19 Ze lijken nu wel voor elkaar te krijgen dat er zoveel discussie is dat er niks meer gebeurd. @Shell @exxonmobil @We_Are_BP_Oil @TEXACO_OIL @Esso_NL @q8 en collega's zijn dan de winnaars van het verhaal!
948 2018-12-27 22:19:16 we dont want to be good for Israel let them fight for oil by themselves
949 2018-12-27 22:19:13 You know you’re yogi and zen AF when you tell your mom you need to bring your essential oil diffuser to New Hampshire for the weekend because you “can’t be in a room that doesn’t smell good.”

953 2018-12-27 22:18:56 The oil?
954 2018-12-27 22:18:55 Valid point, but I could see this going sideways really quickly
955 2018-12-27 22:18:46 Well no because the oil is rescinding and a big the is the Scottish gov would have to Join PCA which commits to the end cutting out greenhouse gases

Yes previous countries but under the Lisbon treaty you are required to. 

If they don't join euro what currency they gonna use
956 2018-12-27 22:18:41 If we ever extract and use all of the oil, we will be extinct.
957 2018-12-27 22:18:24 whats wrong with cbd oil companies?

963 2018-12-27 22:17:50 What about Prague, OK? I bet the oil industry is behind it. We can send in @SenWarren to connect with tribal leaders to find a Russian connection there.
964 2018-12-27 22:17:47 Maybe we're not drinking enough Bulletproof Coffee mixed with MCT oil and grass-fed butter.
965 2018-12-27 22:17:47 You're looking at the wrong thing. Oil production must decline and the price is effectively set by the lowest-cost producer, Saudi Arabia, to control oversupply. The future for the UK is high-tech, or just being a low-wage economy.
966 2018-12-27 22:17:38 Don't let the beads and Patchouli fool you CBD oil does work. But because legality just happened science hasn't yet had time to test for correct dosage. Have fun experimenting!

974 2018-12-27 22:16:52 Call me basic but I love my pasta soaked in olive oil, garlic, and pepper.
975 2018-12-27 22:16:47 I was. I'd tell them that the Vietnam war ended badly when people were evacuated from atop the S Vietnamese embassy, we had gas lines due to an Arab oil embargo, Nixon and Watergate was a terrible experience, Jimmy Carter tried but failed, inflation was close to 20%. What else?
976 2018-12-27 22:16:35 And me. But in general we got sympathy. (The bloke with the broom was pretty unfriendly I suppose). This poor woman is being shamed on here. Imagine what havoc I could have caused with an electricity supply and an oil tank.
977 2018-12-27 22:16:34 I like Banega just fine but the olive oil is seeping into Emery’s brain if he thinks that’s what’s going to make us tick.
978 2018-12-27 22:16:32 Oil change then tires
979 2018-12-27 22:16:28 Yeah saw it on the Union Jack Oil website a while back...
About 16% in the license area 
980 2018-12-27 22:16:26 After extensive research, I finally decided to try @herbivorebeauty. I used the Jasmine Green Tea Balancing Toner and the Lapis Facial Oil. My skin went from 100% pissed off to 100% soothed and no longer inflamed! I don’t know why I didn’t switch sooner

984 2018-12-27 22:16:13 i think edwin should cut his hair. the growth is evident, but he need to moisturize a little more with some coconut oil and olive oil creams
985 2018-12-27 22:16:08 I would have gladly loosened a bolt in the transmission oil to let just a bit squirt out, just a little Blackhawk love. It's fine. We are all fine.
986 2018-12-27 22:16:03 Tobacco set the template for big oil and the sugar industry. Frustrating that we haven’t learnt how to combat corporate interests which are bad for public health.
987 2018-12-27 22:15:57 Have him listen to ISE EGO, NWA, FUWA SUWA, OIL an many more other hit 4rm the hitmaker himself!! Or maybe he is be released from kirikiri recently!!! #FINOISAGOAL

990 2018-12-27 22:15:46 Also "as with oil, our reserves of sand will never run out" is a really odd take. We're burning through both of those far faster than they're being replenished, and doing it faster every year.

996 2018-12-27 22:14:49 Snake oil salesmen gonna snake. 

Except successful snake oil salesmen haul ass to the next town & find new marks. I'm certain there was a class on this at Trump University. 
997 2018-12-27 22:14:46 i need a fucking oil change bad
998 2018-12-27 22:14:43 They made one in early 2000's but the oil industry wouldn't let it go mainstream.
999 2018-12-27 22:14:40 One would think there would be a need for peanut oil in vaccines to cause an allergy, but there never was. It was tested many years back, but never used. You’ve listened to the voices of the echo chamber again. And they were wrong.
1000 2018-12-27 22:14:36 Welke agenda?
Van schone lucht?

Wat als je zelf gebruikt wordt om de agenda van big oil door te drukken? 
1001 2018-12-27 22:14:34 hedge fund of my barge olive oil bangs their clot lissom
1002 2018-12-27 22:14:13 If that’s how you feel about it, what would you do to take this stewed cabbage to another level ?!                                          One head cabbage

1003 2018-12-27 22:14:13 but then gets worse 
its high treason
in the old days to destroy our infrastructure you needed to send bombs
now you just buy it with carbon credits and shut it down
crude oil from algie still is oil burning forests is worse than burning coal
burning garbage is worse than b coal

1005 2018-12-27 22:13:59 tfw you have to roll but you just can't be arsed, but still it's the only way, they won't give/subsidise me oil or flower so fuck em, i'll be back later, enjoy the tune
1006 2018-12-27 22:13:58 Truffle oil is minging. How anyone can ruin their food with that shit wants their heads tested.
1007 2018-12-27 22:13:55 Yong basura nga nila sa luneta ndi nila madala, yan pa kaya 
1008 2018-12-27 22:13:54 This rosehip oil doesn’t smell dusty should I trust it
1009 2018-12-27 22:13:53 Hate waiting to get an oil change 
1010 2018-12-27 22:13:35 no Tom no no no no! The Liberals told us in the 70s that we were going to have world overpopulation, Famine, loss of natural resources, run out of oil, and a whole host of other things – don't you believe them? LOL Industrialization always lowest population growth @sullivanradio
1011 2018-12-27 22:13:28 Why have i been sitting here for a hour for just an oil change 
1012 2018-12-27 22:13:08 Crude oil prices have plunged 30% since early October.  Nothing to do with repeal of cap-and-trade. #onpoli
1013 2018-12-27 22:13:03 Deep conditioned my hair with palm oil, honey and coconut oil today. My hair is super soft 
1014 2018-12-27 22:12:31 Ahhh, yes, the dreaded oil, competition to all your ponsy scheme investments. And those politicians you share the spoils with to further fleece the tax payer... Very bad for you. Never mind, your house of cards is about to collapse...
1015 2018-12-27 22:12:23 My mom saw stains on the floor that looks like blood or red wine. She’s currently pouring anointing oil and praying on it
1016 2018-12-27 22:12:20 whale whale whale if it’s not the source from which I render blubber to get the oil for the lanterns I use outside your window as I spy.
1017 2018-12-27 22:12:18 It is TERRIBLE. He needs a hot oil treatment or something.
1018 2018-12-27 22:12:12 Absolutely true. All that oil stays in California. Half of our emissions are transport. And rising.
1019 2018-12-27 22:11:44 Fairly positive on CBD oil so far. Mild, relaxing. Read extremely positive reports in regards to stopping RLS so bought some today. Will see.
1020 2018-12-27 22:11:37 Of course the oil companies will fight tooth and nail against any meaningful progress. So fuck them. If we run the govt based on what will piss them off the least we won't get anywhere.
1021 2018-12-27 22:11:26 I’m getting a New Years bonus but I am going to be a responsible person and use it on new glasses and an oil change and ITS KILLING ME
1022 2018-12-27 22:11:18 those are going to be sharp when you clear/oil them!
1023 2018-12-27 22:11:14 That’s cool.  My hometown has stabilized at about the same size as Hillyard.  When I lived there there was an influx of workers because of price of oil made drilling in the Overthrust Belt profitable (have to drill through 2 layers of shale so usu not worth it, like now).
1024 2018-12-27 22:11:10 Not really I think most people know the political stance of the IEA but surely it is important to know who who funds research.Would you trust research paid for by tobacco or oil/coal companies anymore than that paid by renewable energy etc transparency is vital on left or right
1025 2018-12-27 22:11:08 We have some openings for service tomorrow. Come get 10%off oil changes tomorrow!!!
1026 2018-12-27 22:11:03 #UJO now owns reasonable percentage in dukes wood oil field
1027 2018-12-27 22:11:02 So then you know about the peanut oil.  Good... but that doesn't make you concerned about how the adjuvants ended up causing the peanut allergy for so many people? They may not get measles but they'll die of their neighbor's peanut butter sammie. Sad.
1028 2018-12-27 22:10:55 In totally unrelated news, the price per barrel of crude oil has slipped from ~$75USD the day @fordnation was elected to ~$53USD today! About a 30% drop, wow! Incredibly, the price of gasoline has also dropped by nearly 30% over the same time period. Probably coincidence.
1029 2018-12-27 22:10:47 労い、ありがとうございます。

その分、明日からのコミケは思いっきり楽しむことにしました！！

いえーい！！！
1030 2018-12-27 22:10:42 I mean, it might have a little to do with it. Oil has fallen further than that and gas has been over a buck.
1031 2018-12-27 22:10:21 While relevant today, this whole conversation will one day sound pretty strange. Like dial-tones on cellphones. Oil changes are things car owners shouldn’t ever have to worry about.
1032 2018-12-27 22:10:19 咎さんも猫苦手なのか…
1033 2018-12-27 22:10:14 Beware:  State Farm insurance is spying on their clients by buying your mileage information from oil change people and then using the information to raise your rates.
1034 2018-12-27 22:10:08 Damage they could easily fix by application of peppermint oil!
1035 2018-12-27 22:10:04 カルーアサラダ油とかあったら若い女性に大人気美味しさイナズマ級なのになあ。
1036 2018-12-27 22:09:59 Im at the dealership getting an oil change & one of the guys keeps trying to talk me into getting a new car. Lol PLEASE stop tempting me Bc ya girl makes awful decisions & that is an awful decision I would LOVE to make.
1037 2018-12-27 22:09:58 Crude oil is in oversupply actually and has slumped on the market
1038 2018-12-27 22:09:42 I couldn't agree more. However, the fact that American auto makers only represent a portion of the consumption problem I remain unconvinced that electric cars will/can unilaterally transform the energy sector. We haven't addressed the question of oil and cargo transportation.
1039 2018-12-27 22:09:42 Very unrealistic budget by the regime. There’s no way they’ll export that many barrels of oil especially after the waivers expire. They’ll be lucky to export 500,000 bpd.
1040 2018-12-27 22:09:37 There ain't much oil in Syria, either 
1041 2018-12-27 22:09:35 You are seriously are inept at reading, understanding and answering questions. 

How, exactly, does cannabis oil stop mitosis in tumours BUT NOT IN other non-tumourous cells?
1042 2018-12-27 22:09:22 Gotta get that DAMN fourth oil country
1043 2018-12-27 22:09:16 DJ let us know if the oil helps you with your anxiety. My daughter suffers from it pretty severely. She doesn't like taking meds she says it makes her feel drug out. Thanks for sharing. #SPNFamily
1044 2018-12-27 22:09:15 I'm waiting to get my oil changed at one of those quick lube places bc I'm disastrous at vehicle maintenance and i really should have brought dinner....
1045 2018-12-27 22:09:05 I'm hoping the essential oil diffuser that I ordered will solve all my problems.
1046 2018-12-27 22:08:53 なんて言うか、こんなことになるなら最初から労働基準法を盾にガンガン押せばよかったと思ってますわ…
今の派遣先に迷惑をかけたくないとか考えすぎました。

1047 2018-12-27 22:08:52 Any old shite will do as an excuse fur bricking it ,  Don't like Alex Salmond , Don't like Nicola Sturgeon ,  currency , Nicola Sturgeon's toaster , Nicola Sturgeon's shoes , oil , noo it's  the guy disny live here , a knocked on doors during indy and witnessed the fear firsthand
1048 2018-12-27 22:08:35 thank god i was raised w boys & know how to change my tire & oil.
1049 2018-12-27 22:08:35 The oil embargo, the energy crisis, and 11 months of daylight savings time. Oh and micro dot and blotter.
1050 2018-12-27 22:08:34 DID YOU GIVE SOME OF THAT OIL TO BIG DEX?????
1051 2018-12-27 22:08:27 Have we ever checked if they contain oil?
1052 2018-12-27 22:08:25 Into bed with you. But daddy needs to rub your chest with eucalyptus oil and pour you a snifter of Brandy.#gatheryouup,#chickensoup
1053 2018-12-27 22:08:16 Much less destruction than the yearly death toll for solar and wind.

Most of the animals in the oil spill could be wiped off. Less than 120k effected animals 1 time during the spill. 

The solar and turbine deaths are permanent. 300k+ every year.
1054 2018-12-27 22:08:09 really thinking of dropping acrylics & just doing oil painting for a lil bit.
1055 2018-12-27 22:08:04 Pure honey

1056 2018-12-27 22:07:54 It's TOS isn't it? Tabaco, Oil and Sugar

Well i think it is. I think your a bunch of TOS-ers :-) aren't you ?
1057 2018-12-27 22:07:50 As we prepare for 2019 watch Erdogan and Turkey. With Turkish local elections in the Spring and a pending economic crisis in Turkey Erdogan must play the Nationslist tune at once. USA withdrawal of support for Kurds in Syria and oil exploration around Cyprus may provoke Erdogan!!
1058 2018-12-27 22:07:49 The Day i See Phyno Shutting Down North and Not East, I will cal him a legend but for now, 2018 wasn't for him he needs fresh oil from Wizkid and Davido.

1059 2018-12-27 22:07:44 Does Trudeau exempting Saudi Arabian oil from carbon taxes this week mean that a big chunk of Canada pays more for gas on January 1 but Quebec won't?
1060 2018-12-27 22:07:43 Just realised that my creativity only resides when I’m making things for other people. Like if I want to learn oil/acrylic + anatomy more just so that I can paint portraits with the most extra compositions I can think of
1061 2018-12-27 22:07:38 @realDonaldTrump  obama is not the founder one of them  could have been poppy bush who when head of cia started sons abusto oil that funded your buddies the saudis who started alquida which then turned into isis too  so maybe get your history and facts straight fake news
1062 2018-12-27 22:07:32 The government in Alberta does not own the oil companies profits In Norway all profits go to government #Socialism
1063 2018-12-27 22:07:29 CBD oil?
1064 2018-12-27 22:07:29 If you don't have enough time for a full shower shaving session, just smooth baby oil onto your legs before you take the razor to them.
1065 2018-12-27 22:07:19 Something about oil?
1066 2018-12-27 22:07:10 Terrible. People who do this should be boiled in oil
1067 2018-12-27 22:06:59 I bet your oil paintings are shameful enough lol
1068 2018-12-27 22:06:59 Good glad you’re sorted! Get some engine oil cleaner 
1069 2018-12-27 22:06:57 Coconut oil or cocoa butter is a solid one too, I just didn't like the smell of coconut oil. Time is a deceptively good healer.
1070 2018-12-27 22:06:47 Oil money made your club. Without  the investing of large amounts of money in the club from the Arabs you wouldn’t be anywhere near league titles pal.
1071 2018-12-27 22:06:42 Hate paying $60 for an oil change like why yo I’m tired of adulting
1072 2018-12-27 22:06:39 Early postulatators thought presence of crude oil at the Tchad's part of the Lake Tchad could have motivated Idris Dheby to arm BH
1073 2018-12-27 22:06:28 I know this company, they hire ex military, their offices are in Stellenbosch. They also do jobs in the Niger delta protecting oil fields
1074 2018-12-27 22:06:12 It’s sorted went to Pete’s on way home was a jubilee clip that had come off oil all over engine though
1075 2018-12-27 22:06:09 @PaulasChoice under eye cream made with jojoba oil is great. Moisturizes and is not irritating.
1076 2018-12-27 22:06:05 Venezuela was doing absolutely fine until the US took issue with how they were selling oil and crashed their economy. The problems in Venezuela are to do with America not wanting fair competition and very little to do with socialism.
1077 2018-12-27 22:06:04 Beta O’Rourke voted with Republicans a majority of times in important decisions that made life miserable for the regular working American.  He also takes money from the Oil industry and is opposed to a Green New Deal and Medicare for All and Free college.  WTF folks?  He sucks
1078 2018-12-27 22:05:50 * get any of them with argan oil it take away the smell.
1079 2018-12-27 22:05:50 Alright kfb
1080 2018-12-27 22:05:44 & he getting the oil changed
1081 2018-12-27 22:05:44 I’m pretty sure I have Osterine in my blood stream. I drink more energy drinks a day than should be allowed. I also take supplements of names I can’t even pronounce. I also coat my bald head with some kind of oil from Ulta. I hope @TheTrueView1 doesn’t test me before Sunday. 
1082 2018-12-27 22:05:42 Iraq has nothing to do with keeping America safe. It was about getting their oil. Still is.
1083 2018-12-27 22:05:36 In case you need inspiration - I will tell you how I've cooked one of my fav veg this season:Brussels Sprouts>boiled to buggery then mashed with olive oil/chopped & roasted w garlic & shallots/brushed w miso+griddled/shredded in an omelette/+ many more
1084 2018-12-27 22:05:35 This is the 1 week of the year that gravy trumps coconut oil. Frostbite? Put some gravy on it. Didn’t get what you wanted for Xmas? Eat some gravy. Ice on the sidewalk out front? Throw gravy out there. Boyfriend didn’t propose? Pour gravy on his face while he’s sleeping. #yql
1085 2018-12-27 22:05:29 my boyfriend got me all new tires and an oil change for christmas best present everrrrrrrr
1086 2018-12-27 22:04:58 If your go/to position is that the loonie is always dragged down by oil commodities, why do you blindly support the whining eastern wannabe separatist pinheads and liberals that are destroying the oil industry in Canada. Ahhhhh right that who pays you to crank out your fake news
1087 2018-12-27 22:04:50 That is the least now, someone who bought Total, chevron, Samsung, LG, forte oil and shares in China economy, negotiations are online for the purchase of the Sun and moon  self.
1088 2018-12-27 22:04:49 It isn’t a matter of agreeing or disagreeing. It is a matter of empirical measurements. Yes Alberta is experiencing low prices for oil but consider our production levels are historic highs. We have never exported so much oil.  Pricing is not in our government’s power.
1089 2018-12-27 22:04:40 @trish_regan Why is Venezuela doing business with Russia? We mismanaged the pre -Chavez regime. Venezuela became an abused quasi US State. I did business there in the 70s & 80s. for oil and infrastructure. Want to know more? $Billions in graft.
1090 2018-12-27 22:04:28 This morning at a coffee shop in Vermont the barista asked if I wanted a shot of CBD oil in my cafe au lait #ilovevermont
1091 2018-12-27 22:04:27 I made ravioli and accidentally grabbed the fucking apple cider vinegar bottle instead of the garlic olive oil one because they look really similar, please kill me.
1092 2018-12-27 22:04:14 markets in fondue oil
1093 2018-12-27 22:04:07 I'm going to add some to coconut oil and give it a try for after shave! I struggle to find things that work for me due to awful allergies and super sensitive skin. Tea tree oil, witch hazel, and apple cider vinegar have recently become staples in my hair and skin care.
1094 2018-12-27 22:03:58 Hello from sydney, in short , I don’t want it for 2reasons
firstly Commercial whaling (which is mainly for oil & profit ) & cruelty 
my main reason it has a huge impact on the extinction of all whales species , plus the impact it will have on climate change & whale &marine life
1095 2018-12-27 22:03:53 Yes oil spills are bad.

However we have technology to avoid oil spills now.

BP shouldn't have happened if they followed the regulations that were on the books.

However even the terrible BP oil spill only killed less than 5k.

Even counting all effected wildlife it only was
1096 2018-12-27 22:03:49 Abacha oil money , use your brain
1097 2018-12-27 22:03:47 I just did a hot oil treatment and a deep condition on my hair. My hair feels amazing 
1098 2018-12-27 22:03:47 And the international currency for oil is the dollar, if only we had some of that! Oh wait we do except 95% is in Scottish waters. Just keep telling the daft jocks it's worthless, cause we don't tax the companies extracting it, it's running out and you're subsidised!
1099 2018-12-27 22:03:38 I got my free oil change and it was free lol no hidden cost
1100 2018-12-27 22:03:36 Pizza 1/2

For pizza dough:

Mix 7g of yeast with 1tsp of caster sugar, 1tbsp olive oil and 150ml of warm water. Sit for 10 minutes after stirring. Add 250g of bread flour and a pinch off salt, knead, oil and prove.
1101 2018-12-27 22:03:30 Lol i don’t think it’s  Victorian just woods, oil paintings and antiques 
1102 2018-12-27 22:03:25 When de dipped dem inside the bleaching oil their dick was used to suspend them...
1103 2018-12-27 22:03:18 You can forget the oil and gas, because they will be almost worthless when we take climate change seriously.
1104 2018-12-27 22:03:18 I got my oil changed and the guy said, "Your filter is pretty dirty. It's $19.99," and I said, "1999? How's that possible? My car is a 2006?" Fml I'm an idiot
1105 2018-12-27 22:03:16 not a bad idea... Peppermint is considered a “hot” oil 
1106 2018-12-27 22:03:10 Bear hugs and baby oil all day
1107 2018-12-27 22:03:03 But way out of date with all the new oil very recently discovered.

1110 2018-12-27 22:02:44 I like the elf eye cream. I like hyaluronic acid from the ordinary under the eye best though, then I use oil on top if very dry
1111 2018-12-27 22:02:30 Burn all the opiate fields move the troops to Iraq or leave Iraq as they don't want us there move them to Israel a not terrorist nation protect their oil and them
Move troops to the borders as they don't want to build a wall
1112 2018-12-27 22:02:22 How do you say "I wanna slurp you up like an oil spoil" in Swahili.
1113 2018-12-27 22:02:06 Gotta oil my rusty dusty book pussy before seeing family
1114 2018-12-27 22:01:56 I'm not really into porn but I also loved the oil wrestling scenes.
1115 2018-12-27 22:01:43 Drive thru oil changes breh
1116 2018-12-27 22:01:42 And I can change my own oil and check my own fluids.
1117 2018-12-27 22:01:42 Let's not kid ourselves, regardless of their upcoming successes and/or failures, the Oilers will be in this race for quite some time. This is what today's NHL is. Get hot for a couple of weeks and the playoffs become a real possibility. This league is mediocrity at its finest.
1118 2018-12-27 22:01:41 I want to understand what people mean by bad.. 
IWA, FUWA, NWA and then Oil, then Pray ft Teni.. 

Olamide had Kana, motigbana, poverty die.. And because Olamide had his Olic and Phyno didn't do Phyno fest. 
Phyno now had a bad year.. These people are funny 
1119 2018-12-27 22:01:40 Please try the RSO oil.  My 2 tumors in my left lung are 1/3 their size in 2 months.
1120 2018-12-27 22:01:26 Later is right. Equivocating masculinity & self-sufficiency on whether or not one changes the oil in their own vehicle? Weak, & limited in vision.
1121 2018-12-27 22:01:08 Marzipan
is a food emulsion that contains 4 phases: a solid phase of suspended particles including almonds and sugars, a suspended air pocket phase formed from incorporated air during mixing, a water phase, and a lipid phase from almond oil.
1122 2018-12-27 22:01:05 what about the end of oil and gas. coal is marginal.
1123 2018-12-27 22:01:00 In other totally unrelated news, the price per barrel of crude oil has slipped from ~$75USD the day @fordnation was elected to ~$53USD today! About a 30% drop, wow! Incredibly, the price of gasoline has also dropped by nearly 30% over the same time period. Probably coincidence.
1124 2018-12-27 22:00:59 Yea, I got that impression from the movie.  Seemed like he was running the show.  When preparing to invade Iraq, the maps of Iraq were oil location maps, Halliburton got zero bid contracts.  The whole 'unitary executive' thing and so on.
1125 2018-12-27 22:00:54 you really just need some salt, pepper, and olive oil for the avo. maybe a fried egg on top w hot sauce if ya feelin fancy ya know. idk half the stuff they put on avo toast in restaurants sometimes.

1130 2018-12-27 22:00:37 try cbd oil and cbd vape liquid. takes away the crfaving and has zero thc in it. its actually pretty awesome.
1131 2018-12-27 22:00:36 is oil bouncing up on that support for a bit or do you see it going lower to your other support lines?

1141 2018-12-27 22:00:00 why does it take so long to change oil bc ik for a fact that it doesn’t take as long as it’s taking!
1142 2018-12-27 21:59:51 For stuffed sinus we put a drop of peppermint oil to the roof the mouth and you can feel it just clear up
1143 2018-12-27 21:59:48 Well that'll be 10k for instructions on how to make the perfect palm oil flakes
1144 2018-12-27 21:59:38 So, no oil from Saudi Arabia but you have no problem typing that message out on your built in China iPhone.
1145 2018-12-27 21:59:32 Can you believe that dish soap markets itself as saving baby sea birds after human-induced oceanic oil spills? I am so mad at my blue dish soap bottle when I realize the emotional manipulation it concocts on my psyche.
1146 2018-12-27 21:59:31 Are you -ing serious @neilhimself ?? Paulo Cohelo books are as excellent as snake oil is effective...
1147 2018-12-27 21:59:24 Oil does do some damage to animals.

I simply haven't seen any evidence that it does nearly as much damage as solar and wind turbines.

If the regulations are followed of course.

The BP Oil spill killed 4,500 animals and that was huge.

Wind turbines kill 300k per year.
1148 2018-12-27 21:59:19 CBD oil is tight. I use a pain elixir for my back and hands often. (I hate taking pain pills)
1149 2018-12-27 21:59:01 Maybe just eat the head. Lol. Try the oil on a day off. Some people dream too much.
1150 2018-12-27 21:59:00 Have you listened to "oil"???? 
Please do then silently delete this trash u tweeted
1151 2018-12-27 21:58:59 1) Other than the one tweet that listed Beto as the no. 2 recipient of oil industry money (and his other tweets supporting it), Sirota's reporting has been extremely on point, especially his reporting on Beto's voting record.
1152 2018-12-27 21:58:58 How far apart did she drink the second one?  cause I just bought 3 bottles of orange juice and castor oil 
1153 2018-12-27 21:58:57 Not too far fetched.

I remember during the Atkin's Diet craze, ad execs convinced restaurant chain execs that,  despite the white flour, chicken skins, oil, sodium....that consumers would buy KFC...because it's "health food".

1156 2018-12-27 21:58:45 Trump supporters got played by a con man, a snake oil salesman, a buffoon of gigantic proportions whose act includes silly insults, endless blustering and telling his supporters that stupidity is a virtue and they're victims of the coastal elite. But hey, Mueller's coming for you
1157 2018-12-27 21:58:39 With any scarring, usually bio oil and moisturiser helps. Scars tend to fade with time though. Skin is clever stuff. Don't worry though, you always look great anyway

1160 2018-12-27 21:58:30 years ago I helped with a project at another school which put boarding up on the fence surrounding the oil tank, then getting an arts grant to engage a street artist to work with the kids to create a mural. It stood for 9 years without being tagged 
then the tank was removed

1164 2018-12-27 21:58:23 unless you're a bit dim, you'll notice that oil was discovered there, and there hasn't been peace since. Syria is a proxy war with the Russians, not a religious conflict. If you haven't spotted that, then you are rather dim.

1168 2018-12-27 21:58:00 Does wild growth oil really work?
1169 2018-12-27 21:57:59 That’s avg. in reality it should be around 70 cents / liter nationwide according to global drop in price per barrel of oil.
The oil companies in Canada  are allowed to set an unfair price at the pump in favour of their profit margin

Seriously????
1173 2018-12-27 21:57:26 Term structure of #oil seems too flat relative to the price level.. persistent sub-50 oil is likely to result in production cuts that would balance the market by end of next year.. 12 months spread in $CL is currentlt at 2.65.. but in early 2016 it got to 12 on supply fears
1174 2018-12-27 21:57:25 There’s about a hundred million people looking for their paychecks from the oil companies apparently
1175 2018-12-27 21:57:18 my understanding is that mint oil causes paralysis by relaxing joint, but i havn't looked into it.
1176 2018-12-27 21:57:17 Keller Ford just checked my lights, changed my oil, and cashed me out in 6 minutes 
1177 2018-12-27 21:57:13 I didn’t see that so I can’t comment on it specifically. Nonetheless I disagree with the assertion that oil/gas employees are as bad as oil/gas CEOs
1178 2018-12-27 21:56:53 Low oil prices really help the US consumer ... they also have record high employment.... recession is not imminent ... real rates are around zero
1179 2018-12-27 21:56:45 #1 cause of climate change is cycles of the sun. #2 volcanoes #3 cattle & their methanegas #4 forest fires #5 oil wells burning #6 ocean temperature rising because of volcanoes.

1180 2018-12-27 21:56:45 I really LOVED) the oil wrestling scenes between Kim & Bonnie. You're artwork is nothing short of amazing! They really look like they did on the show and they LOOKED like they were oil wrestling! However, I'm not into the ah...glory hole scene being that I like girls! lol

1186 2018-12-27 21:56:11 not specifically an eye cream but the Clinique 72 hour moisture surge hydrator is really pleasant, oil free and can be used under makeup as well
1187 2018-12-27 21:56:11 And the oil is locked up in a solid so chances are it's not like he's gonna swallow any, but still I bet the smell is enough to aggravate him
1188 2018-12-27 21:56:08 isn't there this little subject of OIL?
1189 2018-12-27 21:55:55 Crap. The Chavez “boom” was built on high oil prices and the sale of seized assets. The result - no-one would invest, agricultural estates ceased to function under incompetent Chavez cronies and the new “managers” of oil production had no idea how to manage.

1192 2018-12-27 21:55:19 Yes, I don't agree nuclear is that problematic either.

It definitely scares me but when to you speak to people in the I dustry you learn how wrong you can be by making assumptions.

The exact same goes with oil production.
1193 2018-12-27 21:55:04 Crude Oil Prices May Turn Lower as Market Mood Sours Anew
1194 2018-12-27 21:55:00 I know how to do both + change the oil 
1195 2018-12-27 21:54:56 True. But as @TheEconomist put it: "because sand is relatively cheap, it tends to be uneconomical to transport it across long distances". Indeed, millions of tonnes of sand are dumped to reclaim land when mud would be just as suitable. Sand is no more in short supply than oil.

1198 2018-12-27 21:54:22 Ah yes. That’s the long read on Venezuela. Key as you read - notice how a few bad decisions, plus good intentions leads to a death spiral. And in their case they have nationalized oil which should have been a golden goose to pay for everything.

1213 2018-12-27 21:52:14 Let’s try this for basic. You have a product that everyone in the world needs (oil). You can only get it to one customer and they know it so offer you next to nothing for it. Should you find other customers or go broke?

1224 2018-12-27 21:50:48 Hey #Alberta, according to @fordnation, he's taking credit for the collapse in oil prices and therefore the lower cost of gas. So, if you have a beef to pick with anyone, it's good ole Doug for ruining your economy. #AccordingToDoug #ONPoli

1230 2018-12-27 21:50:07 I dont understand what a woman would see in a man that is so evil that he killed his unborn child and his other daughters that loved him so much and broke their little legs so he could hide them in oil tanks. These women must be sick and evil too that would want this man
1231 2018-12-27 21:49:56 I notice that we shift topics often. Are there any points of mine you can acknowledge? Like, that oil also does damage to animals? or our health?
1232 2018-12-27 21:49:48 My fat ass really wanted a pretzel and now i have oil all over my pants
1233 2018-12-27 21:49:41 Too bad you, too, are not a reader. Allen's article clarifies just one tiny nuance but is otherwise supportive of my points about Beto."donations attributed to the oil and gas business include both a handful from executives and many others from lower-level employees"
1234 2018-12-27 21:49:32 i don’t do the mani thing bc i work with my hands. can’t be dropping change on my hands when tomorrow i’m gonna have engine oil and transmission fluid all over em lol

1240 2018-12-27 21:48:57 I couldn’t find this avocado oil sea salt chips I normally get so I got the wood smoked version, and idk what I was expecting but that Smokey taste always takes me out :(((
1241 2018-12-27 21:48:52 So, I added oil to my car earlier (0w-20 if you need to know) and I just ate a bagel. About halfway through I realized something doesn’t taste good and it hit me that there may still be oil under my nails from breaking the top of the oil quart. 

Hope I don’t die before 2019

1245 2018-12-27 21:48:29 "gasoline prices are at near-18-month lows because of global oil prices that have tumbled over the past two months on worries of an economic downturn, a U.S.-China trading tiff and concerns that members of the OPEC oil cartel won't live up to production cuts."
1246 2018-12-27 21:48:24 Note to self: Never ever argue about Arsenal with Shola again.

We will never agree - just like oil and water.
1247 2018-12-27 21:48:19 My god please tell me that all conservatives aren't as stupid (or gullible) as @NatKusendova and @fordnation  - news flash - oil is being traded at lower prices all over the planet.
1248 2018-12-27 21:48:18 I was just reminded of how I met my wife.  (True story) She pumped the gas in my car and checked my oil. Remember when people actually did that? Her father owned the local gas station. I wanted to meet her so I had her fill up my car.
(We've been married 37 years now  )
1249 2018-12-27 21:48:08 I beg to differ on this Bruh.
Phyno had a disappointing year?

Using the word "disappointing" to describe Phyno's year is utter bullocks.

Only those who don't listen to his songs can brand his year "disappointing"

Fuwa sewa, Iwa, N.W.A, Onyeoma, Oil. What do you want again?
1250 2018-12-27 21:48:05 The Conservatives are a one issue party; maintain and/or increase fossil fuel industry profits. @AndrewScheer will never side with Canadians; he works exclusively for the oil and gas industry. His singular focus will accelerate global extinction caused by climate change.
1251 2018-12-27 21:47:46 Catherine Murray is yet again hosting Raffi Tahmazian, who is ranting away about the Trudeau government being determined to kill the oil sector (which is clearly why it purchased the TMX project). Why not just record-and-encore Tahmazian and Brett Wilson? #cdnpoli @BNNBloomberg.
1252 2018-12-27 21:47:37 _Anything that carrys oil(anointing) cannot perish. Fighting a man with the oil it's suicidal._

_I decree by the Bazooka(anointing) on my head, Anyone that touches you by mistake, shall die by correction._
1253 2018-12-27 21:47:33 And I’m sure the giant oil companies that pay large amounts of money to political parties, will just sit on the sidelines and let that happen? I own a Solar company, and I’m all in for green energy. But oil products don’t stop at filling the tank, there needs to be balance.
1254 2018-12-27 21:47:14 Ready to wait 3 hours at WalMart to get my oil changed we love accessibility 
1255 2018-12-27 21:47:14 need to get an oil change but instead im contemplating gettin a pedicure
1256 2018-12-27 21:47:09 The oil slick is my fave
1257 2018-12-27 21:47:08 Y’all I just got an oil change n it took these ppl bout 7 mins. Did I just get played??? 
1258 2018-12-27 21:47:04 I'm out of pure fiji oil NOOOOO.
1259 2018-12-27 21:47:00 mfs that drink jenny don't value anything, not even themselves. it tastes like what motor oil smells like.
1260 2018-12-27 21:46:59 Ha! I was watching a video of Talence the other day and the French squad went off into the woods for lunch - Kevin took out his little salad lunchbox and the oil and vinegar...so very French!
1261 2018-12-27 21:46:55 You forgot to add...."oil" madt jam by phyno.
1262 2018-12-27 21:46:51 If this is real you better sue
1263 2018-12-27 21:46:50 Will there be a pit map up somewhere for guests to find their favorite driver, teams, vendors?
#TulsaShootOut
1264 2018-12-27 21:46:42 Eventually, most likely on the May long weekend, the oil industry will hike gas prices as they've always done What will Ford blame then?
1265 2018-12-27 21:46:41 nayutaさんの新譜ききたい。
1266 2018-12-27 21:46:41 Anytime bro
1267 2018-12-27 21:46:38 i do this at home but i only use a cheap face massage tool (it could be even a ceramic asian spoon!) and massage oil, it’s a common skin care method in asia and it really clears up your skin while keeping it tight and glowing i have never worn cover up or foundation in my life!
1268 2018-12-27 21:46:27 Oil dey my head and e dey overflow
1269 2018-12-27 21:46:22 #Prayer Almighty Father, that beautiful flame of Yours burning within me, pure fresh oil on it, so that it can begin to burn brighter again in Jesus Name.
1270 2018-12-27 21:46:19  that’s what I am talking about.. eat MCT or coconut oil that will increase ketones and replace sugar and will power you threw the day 
1271 2018-12-27 21:46:18 A drop of pure and natural extra virgin olive oil is an amazing moisturizer for your skin and won’t clog pores!
1272 2018-12-27 21:46:17 What the hell @BarstoolMizzou?!
1273 2018-12-27 21:46:12 What’s a better coconut oil to use, brand wise.. nutiva or garden of life?
1274 2018-12-27 21:45:55 The American people understand that we have an illegitimate president who hoodwinked people to believe he was a great negotiator and business man. Turns out he’s a snake oil salesman and that’s it.
1275 2018-12-27 21:45:55 "gasoline prices are at near-18-month lows because of global oil prices that have tumbled over the past two months on worries of an economic downturn, a U.S.-China trading tiff and concerns that members of the OPEC oil cartel won't live up to production cuts."
1276 2018-12-27 21:45:54 You'd be stupid not to check out Bitcoin and Blockchain tech for yourself. 

You'd also be stupid to believe every snake oil salesman trying to sell you on it. 

Curiosity + Critical Thinking FTW
1277 2018-12-27 21:45:50 Thank u bro
1278 2018-12-27 21:45:44 I woke up at 7 am today to take care of my kid and change the air filter, oil and fix the compression on my nitto tires. Ready for Irwindale at 4pm. Metal and drag racing goes hand in hand. 
1279 2018-12-27 21:45:42 Lol. I might have to try the olive oil soon.
1280 2018-12-27 21:45:16 My husband has created a treatment for skin infections that is all natural and has zero side effects. It's made from a base of coconut oil. We've treated fungal nail infections, athlete's foot, wounds, psoriasis, eczema very successfully. I'd be happy to get some to you to try.
1281 2018-12-27 21:45:14 And who starts some of these local neighborhood squabbles that you now expect the locals to handle?
How started? Weapons sales to anyone and everyone, pursuit of oil to feed US auto thirst, make someone in US richer, etc.?
Get real.
1282 2018-12-27 21:45:08 Love this, I didn’t believe it was $1,500 for his oil change, maybe he asked for a happy ending?
1283 2018-12-27 21:45:06 get some castor oil from whole foods and a clean mascara brush. you can use it on your brows too
1284 2018-12-27 21:45:02 y’all i just put some oil in my car with the help of youtube & i feel so independent
1285 2018-12-27 21:44:48 I don’t see the times as so perilous as simply people afraid of overall pretty good times while looking for things to fear.
1286 2018-12-27 21:44:48 Virgin olive oil is from awkward olives.
1287 2018-12-27 21:44:48 say what you will about italian stereotypes but my dads house does smell of olive oil
1288 2018-12-27 21:44:47 Oil change nothing else mf
1289 2018-12-27 21:44:46 "The phoniest and nastiest things in the world cannot be ingested or even pursued - they must be kissed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
1290 2018-12-27 21:44:37 you smell like adult oil
1291 2018-12-27 21:44:36 Give up the nonsense. We make up 1/3 of UK food & drink, Billions in oil, gas, renewable energy, water, whisky, gin , tourism etc etc Scotland will be fine. UK 2 TRILLION in debt and rising. Also about to crash out of EU, businesses leaving. How many trade deals do they have?? 
1292 2018-12-27 21:44:34 Why when you go to get a oil change they wanna bring up all this shit wrong with your car ? Do wtf I asked you to do and go on!
1293 2018-12-27 21:44:27 Let’s remove gender.

Parents should teach their children. And their children’s friends. Change tire, check oil, jump start, standard, pop it in gear, hand tools, laundry, lawn mower, basic cooking, how to make a bank deposit, basic sewing. #Lifeskills
1294 2018-12-27 21:44:14 me hoping this hot oil thing im trying to do without the proper tools works 
1295 2018-12-27 21:44:12 @ebonijoi  u smell like baby oil
1296 2018-12-27 21:44:12 Abandoning our allies like the Kurds on the word of a morally-bereft dictator, Erdogan, that he will finish off ISIS is insane. What will be accomplished is Erdogan’s goal of destroying Kurds & enriching his son who sells ISIS oil. No one has laid down their arms for plowshares.
1297 2018-12-27 21:44:09 They don't like to mention that Harper was a big buddy of Irving family/Irving Oil, the only company in Canada to import Saudi oil.
1298 2018-12-27 21:44:08 Do you use avocado oil???
1299 2018-12-27 21:44:08 Mixing gasoline and oil would cause an instantaneous explosion.
1300 2018-12-27 21:44:01 Bread and condom oil
1301 2018-12-27 21:43:38 I’m in love with oil diffusers
1302 2018-12-27 21:43:34 I would use an oil that’s safe to put on your face. Oil and that kind of glue don’t mix well so they should be off in no time
1303 2018-12-27 21:43:32 We put on long sleeves, rub a lot of coconut oil and carry lip gloss everywhere we go. Oh! We also wear socks because of dust. Thank you for your concern 
1304 2018-12-27 21:43:31 Nothing to see here...mall, airport, oil tanks..keep on driving.  I hear the Old Port is awesome!
1305 2018-12-27 21:43:31 Steadfastly declining all offers for additional prudent maintenance measures at the oil change spot. Power steering fluid? Get lost, pal. My power steering fluid will last forever.
1306 2018-12-27 21:43:30 We as the others don’t ask you except in 1940 which you said NO remember. You as the US manufactor reason to go to war so your arms & oil companies can make more money, fxxk the men & women you send. Ask the Vets you dump on the streets when your finished with them. 
1307 2018-12-27 21:43:18 @SOPHIEMSMSMSM SOPHIE - Oil of Every Pearl’s Un-Insides
1308 2018-12-27 21:43:11 "pure logic"

Except that the 'logic of unrestrained car use for any/every type of journey' =
massive increase in number of admissions for...
lung disease, heart disease, cancer, diabetes (+ amputations arising) etc etc etc 

Oil mafia logic = Sh*t. BIG TIME.
1309 2018-12-27 21:43:07 IMO, he’s going to Saudi to try to reneg oil prices befor the US has a real credit crisis on its hands.  This would also explain the Mnuchin inquiry on Sunday with the Big banks too.  These prices are killing shale.
1310 2018-12-27 21:43:07 If you think the funding of ‘research’ is irrelevant, I would guess that not much deep thinking went on at your ‘think-tank’. Or do you honestly think tobacco companies do the best research on lung cancer, and oil companies are the top experts on climate change?
1311 2018-12-27 21:43:01 Yeah, the effects of palm oil based diesel substitutes have been far worse than anything corn ethanol did. The two fuels only interact in a limited way, though. Different feedstocks, different markets, some agronomic competition/overlap (both compete against soy).
1312 2018-12-27 21:42:33 Too much supply, shale oil hydrofracturing technology!
1313 2018-12-27 21:42:29 Good decision
1314 2018-12-27 21:42:16 oil no, gasoline yes
1315 2018-12-27 21:42:02 It was in the mid-1970s that the British Pharmacopoeia, a publication of medical substance quality standards for the UK, released a licensed cannabis tincture which featured CBD in full-spectrum oil intended for therapeutic usage. #cbd #cbdoil #discusscannabis #cannabidiol
1316 2018-12-27 21:42:01 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
1317 2018-12-27 21:41:53 The floor clearly had oil on it
1318 2018-12-27 21:41:40 Changing oil is fun.
1319 2018-12-27 21:41:39 It was half over, but it was our bullets and bombs that kept England in the war. It was also our oil and food that benefited the cause even if our guys were not spilling blood yet. Their time came and they paid a steep price for a "johnny-come-lately"
1320 2018-12-27 21:41:23 Asians pride themselves in their chili oil
1321 2018-12-27 21:41:21 But if you like peanut butter, I’d add that to the shakes. Get the natural kind without the additives (ingredients should only say: peanuts & maybe salt depends on the brand) you’ll be able to tell cause the peanut oil rises to the top...peanuts are a “healthy” fat
1322 2018-12-27 21:41:12 It was a whirlwind decade. Watergate dominated the headlines. The Vietnam war finally ended, but not well. An Arab oil embargo forced us to rethinking the automotive industry, & caused a national speed limit of 55 mph. We celebrated our national bicentennial, & then came disco!
1323 2018-12-27 21:40:59 let's say that the last rally from low 42s was a bit awkward but oil is oil after all...
1324 2018-12-27 21:40:55 Trump is a nasty piece of work! He is the cause of oil prices going down in OPEC. @YlanreTVC @tvcnewsng
1325 2018-12-27 21:40:53 First there was NuSkin, then there was R+F, then LulaRoe and Plexus and Jamberry.
Now I must unfollow all the people “partnering” with CBD oil companies. 
Get your hustle on. Do you. But please leave me out of your MLM plans... 
1326 2018-12-27 21:40:53 Coconut oil!
1327 2018-12-27 21:40:48 قلبي وانا أكثر والله .
1328 2018-12-27 21:40:47 My pits smell fresh too! Thanks #TrishMachine for your grooming advice (but seriously, coconut oil can replace regular deodorant, at least for me and Trish)
1329 2018-12-27 21:40:46 you're reading the comments pages on essential oil sales, which is like the "gazing at the necronomicon" of online idiocy
1330 2018-12-27 21:40:45 Anyone else think that Trump pulled our troops out of Syria because of oil interests and/or because he was pushed by Russia or Saudi Arabia to do so?
1331 2018-12-27 21:40:38 Sending out an oil change reminder...
1332 2018-12-27 21:40:38 People should at least be warned that the oil rig is only the first of many
1333 2018-12-27 21:40:37 Get the oil Sykes 2007 sleeves
1334 2018-12-27 21:40:27 Why are they going back to this? Presumably they have enough oil? Do they eat whale?
1335 2018-12-27 21:40:27 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. New York City sleeps.
1336 2018-12-27 21:40:27 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1337 2018-12-27 21:40:26 Burt’s Bees lip oil 
1338 2018-12-27 21:40:26 What mg did you end up getting and did you get a flavored or non-flavored CBD oil?
1339 2018-12-27 21:40:24 Thanks, Gabe. We could use more holy oil . . . And I need to know why that didn’t work with Lucifer. And why the wards failed. Any idea?
1340 2018-12-27 21:40:16 Olive oil over chapstick that’s just my style when my lips are chapped 
1341 2018-12-27 21:40:07 This would be the same Woodside we helped to steal East Timor oil?
1342 2018-12-27 21:40:07 ああ、これ？スポーツブラ。油の貯蔵庫が垂れちゃうからね。
1343 2018-12-27 21:39:54 It was not only sardine oil oo
1344 2018-12-27 21:39:53 Not advertising. My daughter was only using NyQuil for a month, nothing worked. over night essential oil,...Boom!  she was ready for work the following day!!
1345 2018-12-27 21:39:44 @khenney_G @x_enesi @oil_shaeikh say something nice about Aisha and tag  two people that knew her (if possible)
1346 2018-12-27 21:39:39 everybody knows that when DonaldTrump issues alternative facts, a tibetan monch wants to become politician
1347 2018-12-27 21:39:38 Two drops of tea tree oil with a carrier oil (coconut oil, olive oil, grape seed oil, whatever you like)  tea tree is very antibacterial. Lavender is also good. It’s the Holy Oil of all oils 
1348 2018-12-27 21:39:30 But if I hurry I can paint  I just really wanna try the oil paint since I always use acrylics #MissFakePicasso

1352 2018-12-27 21:38:39 i’m getting leas oil changed and had the volume all the way up watching this 
1353 2018-12-27 21:38:30 My T-zone has so much oil I’m surprised America hasn’t tried waging war over it
1354 2018-12-27 21:38:20 Hi Benjamin, we’re sorry to hear this. Please contact our Instant Oil Customer Care team at 1-800-327-8242 or via email at customercare@valvoline.com. They can get more information and provide assistance.
1355 2018-12-27 21:38:16 President Bashar al-Assad, already in command of most of Syria with help from Iranian and Russian allies, has vowed to recover the SDF territory. The region, rich in oil,water and farmland, is seen as important to Syria's reconstruction. 

Adam, topraklarımı geri alacağım diyor
1356 2018-12-27 21:38:15 For soup, cook cubed shallots in oil, then simmer with chicken, oregano, beef broth and red peppers. Top with parmesan.
1357 2018-12-27 21:38:12 Wonderful.

US Imperialists will stay at home.

US Imperialists want to sell soy beans, oil and gas (hmmm, aren't these 3rd world items?).

US Imperialists are easily played by z-category dictators.

US Imperialists version 2018 are as stupid as @POTUS.


1358 2018-12-27 21:38:06 E plenty die!
Pressing iron scar.
Construction rod piercing in the leg.
Dog bite on my butt cheeks.
Forehead koko from falling face down.
Blisters from hot water and oil.
Etc 

Mehn, my childhood scarred me for life
1359 2018-12-27 21:38:03 Been waiting to get my oil change for OVER AN HOUR
1360 2018-12-27 21:37:53 Manny never used flaxseed oil, though...
1361 2018-12-27 21:37:45 "Invaded" because Saddam violated UN Security Council Resolution 687, which ended the first gulf war. 13 years of violations of no fly zones, shooting at coalition aircraft, stealing oil for food money, import/export violations, the list goes on. The Hussein regime brought it on.
1362 2018-12-27 21:37:44 I'm using less heating oil! 
1363 2018-12-27 21:37:43 It was a good day with you .. Thanks bro 
1364 2018-12-27 21:37:39 Going down the list of 101 natural ways to put yourself into labor without an induction and trying them all (except castor oil) and I’m sure one of them will have to work.
1365 2018-12-27 21:37:36 Latest, not our last! Won without blood/oil money too, for those who care about earning your achievements as opposed to having them gifted to you. 
1366 2018-12-27 21:37:35 @EpanouieSkin awww I really need the oil cleanser. I’ve tried ever product except that one. Smh I’ll wait until next restock. Thx for the glow though!!!
1367 2018-12-27 21:37:30 Corn flakes and palm oil
1368 2018-12-27 21:37:24 Butter? I'd suggest Maschine oil. :-D
1369 2018-12-27 21:37:21 @NeNeLeakes  Hi Nene! 

For Greg 2 things...
1. Colloidal Silver
2. Chlorophyll 
3. Black seed oil 

Not saying it’s a cure but definitely enough proof to aide in healing and fighting cancer cells.  Just suggesting since he’s on a homeopathic journey.

Yeah, we recommend a new engine...   
1373 2018-12-27 21:36:40 Agree. Who's going to be burning oil in 2040? EV is already compelling. Only held up by lack of supply and options in the short term. This is changing fast.
1374 2018-12-27 21:36:40 PAPERMINT ESSENTIAL OIL WORKS BEST!
1375 2018-12-27 21:36:23 Raw no good. Best sautéed in butter (although you could use coconut oil) with another large dab of butter on top. Good with spaghetti although I prefer shredded corgette.
1376 2018-12-27 21:36:22 when you go get cooking oil, what do you get? You get veggie oil, olive oil, corn oil, etc. No such thing as cooking/ frying oil. Idc Idc Idc lol
1377 2018-12-27 21:36:20 What if Spongebob actually took place in a giant vat of oil and the Goo Lagoon was actual water that was too dense for the oil to settle below

1381 2018-12-27 21:35:42 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
1382 2018-12-27 21:35:41 Haha that gif is awesome.  I actually do use tea tree oil often.  Mixing a couple drops with my lotion is a the only after shave that will prevent bumps on my wimpy skin. Not all essential oils are bunk.
1383 2018-12-27 21:35:20 So is the problem that AB has the rights? If we nationalized oil & gas would everyone want pipelines, because then it’s not about the environment & just about blocking 1 prov.

And, let’s National oil & gas. What else will we ne nationalizing, manufacturing, fisheries, forestry
1384 2018-12-27 21:35:02 We find oil miles below the oldest fossil records. How about we stop lying about energy.
1385 2018-12-27 21:35:01 Usually tea tree oil, coconut oil, or mark of a man oil
1386 2018-12-27 21:34:52 America is fighting all that you mentioned in your desire for money, oil and political influence to control the world, not for the sake of freedom and human rights
1387 2018-12-27 21:34:25 @ChrisFixed Is replacing an oil pressure sensor on a 2008 Trail Blazer an easy fix?
1388 2018-12-27 21:34:24 I see it more as a regulatory crisis. This industry has and will survive, always does eco 101, supply & demand. Prices change, govts change and until something viable comes along the world needs oil & gas.
1389 2018-12-27 21:34:16 @jiffylube loves to try up selling me on bullshit. been here for 2 hours on a “45 minute” oil change and my total has doubled and I’m going insane #FirstWorldProblems 
1390 2018-12-27 21:34:03 Y'all they just spreading FUD. Its what they do. Its a goal to tear down Elon and Tesla. No one cared abt EV until Tesla and big oil knows its gonna lose all that $$$

1396 2018-12-27 21:33:16 I was told this story by a client a couple of years ago who worked in the oil industry and lived a few miles from Eakring.

Sadly he died a month ago as I would have loved to share this with him.
1397 2018-12-27 21:33:16 *cough* red like roses
1398 2018-12-27 21:33:13 President Trump made a very bold decision to pull back our Troops who were risking their lives for a land that will always be at war and we don’t even need the oil they produce?
1399 2018-12-27 21:33:10 Actually, we had 13 years of reasons to go back. UN Security Council Resolution 687, which ceased hostilities for the first gulf way, were constantly violated by Saddam (no fly, import/export, food for oil, etc). Violation of 687 was all that was needed to go in and get Saddam.

So since I’ve done so good training my hair I avoid it 
1433 2018-12-27 21:29:59 There isn’t too much oil as global demand continues to go up, the only problem we have is not enough pipeline capacity that would allow us to get our oil to other markets.

1466 2018-12-27 21:24:49 the date is not binding.  people are in it because they want to be.  California government set that date becaise they wanted to.  The main people upset are the oil companies.

1487 2018-12-27 21:22:22 I got 100k miles apiece out of my two ‘90s Mondeos without so much as a service or oil change for either. Only one of them let me down once.

1490 2018-12-27 21:21:47 I see the UN compact as putting a date on when everyone must be off oil.

That forces oil companies to raise prices.

I live in California, the entire state must be off oil by 2040.

These things have consequences. It makes oil more expensive for everyone else.

1524 2018-12-27 21:18:43 Oil, like coal, is a fossil fuel, which does not renew itself, so we may be able to sustain ourselves for a few years by depending on old technology, while the world moves forward to find or create new energy sources.
1525 2018-12-27 21:18:43 Look, if you really want to support Beto, why not make the case for how he's actually a great environmentalist and will challenge the oil industry?
1526 2018-12-27 21:18:39 Just need oil to rip tomorrow to see this thing fly.

1528 2018-12-27 21:18:32 I would use it for an essential oil diffuser or something like that, but that’s just me. I have no idea what it’s actually meant for
1529 2018-12-27 21:18:19 Sorry for being absent for a couple days :-( I had my phone stolen and the holidays kept me busy! I’m back now so let’s take some CBD oil together!

1533 2018-12-27 21:17:58 CBD oil is a miracle. Seriously. You can also get a nice CBD/THC blend (higher on the CBD - no pun intended).

Big oil & gas people like Kochs & Exxon lie lie lie. They lied about Climate Change because of $. Not an iotta of tbought to people in danger
1538 2018-12-27 21:17:34 Oh and one more thing. Alberta has to pay a portion of all oil and gas revenue. Does Ontario have to pay a portion of all cars sold... Nope. Does Quebec pay one penny from their hydro revenue....nope. so ya. Alberta pays the most. Look it up
1539 2018-12-27 21:17:32 Your statement sounds great but your government is permitting drilling in the Atlantic and the Gulf of St. Lawrence even as the Gulf dies from a lack of oxygen. 
Please stop. 3/5 of all discovered oil must stay in the ground. #ClimateChangeIsReal
1540 2018-12-27 21:17:31 We need more from oil.
1541 2018-12-27 21:17:31 You read only what fits your narrative so ya, like that. Ford probably actually believes he’s responsible for lowering gas prices because he doesn’t understand how the international oil market works. He’s a high school drop out whose daddy gave him everything on a silver platter
1542 2018-12-27 21:17:23 Good plan because the effects of oil can last 12 hours.

1546 2018-12-27 21:16:55 Correct.  Oil companies know that FF is a very inelastic commodity.  Even if CO2 actually was causing any harm people need to heat/light their homes & drive to work & grocery store.  So they have no need to be seriously concerned about the CAGW scam - they will keep on making $$

1550 2018-12-27 21:16:39 Me too!!! A heating pad helps. Rub some cbd cream/ oil on you also. And of course....vape away.

We (Saskatchewan) are farming/mining to pay for their allowance; then they out vote us on the oil pipeline.

1564 2018-12-27 21:15:11 You have to vape the CBD oil while simultaneously doing Pilates, drinking seventeen gallons of water and then and ONLY then will you achieve the inner eye awakening that cures everything 
1565 2018-12-27 21:15:07 Taking care of your skin is a lot  you got to use a face wash , toner , and moisturizer &amp; oil . Coconut oil is good but it does clog pores and it made me a bit darker so I jumped to shea butter/vitamin E oil and mask every now and then .

I know I know Bush's family is into oil but that was run by others not him so don't at me. Trump is a business man.
1573 2018-12-27 21:14:12 I usually do mine on medium/low heat and use olive oil, and they’re nice and crispy
1574 2018-12-27 21:14:07 I just used my health savings account card at Charlotte's new CBD oil store. Hehe.
1575 2018-12-27 21:14:02 Pricefixing!!!!!!! Oil is at it’s lowest level in years!!!!!! Government fixing the prices so they can lie and say the economy is booming...!!!!!

1587 2018-12-27 21:13:16 @Elise_Jordan...hey, Elise...tell Sam there’s oil in Iraq, and nothing worth that’s worth any money in Afghanistan and Syria. Great job, by the way
1588 2018-12-27 21:13:13 Good point 

I'd love to create a game one day with that sort of look to it, try and develop a 'streaky' graphical style which actually looks like oil paint...
1589 2018-12-27 21:13:06 Every keto group I've joined swears you need special vitamins and ketone supplements. Hog wash, down 95lbs with nothing more than a daily vitamin I've taken for years and fish oil I've taken for years.
1590 2018-12-27 21:13:06 The whole point was/is to stop co-operative democratic oil states developing, to keep the chaos going, to stop any chance of organised pricing.

#CheapOil
1591 2018-12-27 21:13:01 Lie. World oil prices are way down. That is the only reason for the price reduction at the pumps. And they are still high due to gouging by the companies. At the price for oil and exchange rate, we should be around $0.70 retail/litre.

1598 2018-12-27 21:12:12 Reading the comments - in truth it does have something to do with his removal of the carbon tax but mostly because of the drop in oil prices.
1599 2018-12-27 21:12:05 It must be, because you’re still buying oil my dude.
1600 2018-12-27 21:12:04 do 3-6 drops of pure tea tree oil & warm water. gargle then spit, just try not to swallow any & don’t do it too much but tea tree oil works wonders!!! I hope you get to feeling better!
1601 2018-12-27 21:11:58 You are no oil painting Douglas
1602 2018-12-27 21:11:54 yeah i don’t heat my hair, and I only use coconut oil & leave in conditioner really.
1603 2018-12-27 21:11:40 I just bought some CBD oil to try out for anxiety. The guy was super nice but it seems a bit culty. While he was telling me about the oil, he looked like this  . Oh, Tennessee I will miss you.
1604 2018-12-27 21:11:38 He was a kid I bet he got that car from his parents before he merged with it.

The real question is... Does he need oil and trans mission fluid and all that? Where does it go?

Does he have blood or windshield washer flowing in his veins?
1605 2018-12-27 21:11:33 It was a political rally with MAGA hats.  He lied about military pay. You are both grifters, snake oil salesman.  Be Best gold digger.
1606 2018-12-27 21:11:30 Perhaps the focus for renewables should be more on the obvious gains like cleaner air, sustainability of resources, less dependence on middle east oil and fluctuating oil prices, then it's not a debate about whether people believe it
1607 2018-12-27 21:11:30 girl products: here’s a scrub, this is a moisturizer, you’ve got an exfoliator, a toner...

male products: this is a body wash, a shampoo, olive oil, toothpaste, motor oil, preworkout, chip dip, bleach, laundry detergent, shaving cream, and pancake syrup all in one
1608 2018-12-27 21:11:25 I don’t see it as simply an oil issue. The economics of gas, and oil, are such that it is not worth it to capture flared gas for productive use. This could be fixed with gas and oil producer responsibility policy, and could even tighten up on methane leakage.
1609 2018-12-27 21:11:24 Big Oil is not paying me but over $2.5 billion per year from the feds is putting bread on the table of a LOT of climate people many of whom damn well know they'll be out of work if they tell the truth that there is no climate problem. Oil has its foot in the door of R/E BTW
1610 2018-12-27 21:11:24 it isn't the best energy source for countries that don't have oil in the ground. which is exactly why the Gov of India is investing so much in renewables, because it makes financial sense, not because thy are being oppressed
1611 2018-12-27 21:11:22 Yeah climate discourse would've been better without me. I shouldn't have exposed Bush-era NASA climate muzzling & oil guy editing climate reports. I shouldn't have interviewed Jim Hansen ~90 times since '88. Guess I shouldn't have reported on Arctic warming so much- in 2003....
1612 2018-12-27 21:11:10 Dem no know wetin be Oil 
1613 2018-12-27 21:11:08 Something I am currently experimenting with left over paint. Oil on wood, 18cmx18cm. Get all three for R3500 or buy one for 1600. I am open to negotiations. Thank you have a blessed holiday
1614 2018-12-27 21:10:44 I only blow it out and flat iron it if it’s straight weave and  I do it on the day it’s done so it gets heat like once every two weeks. Daily, I put in oil and wrap it the night before when I sleep or after I style it so it last throughout the day. It it’s summer I get a curly
1615 2018-12-27 21:10:42 He was a good snake oil salesman.
1616 2018-12-27 21:10:41 Oil prices go down, Alberta cries to the Feds for help, and DoFo takes a jab at the Feds Climate Change policy.

So AB and ON prov govts are on the opposite end of oil prices (one wants to sell high, the other to buy low), but both use it to chip at the PM.

1627 2018-12-27 21:09:59 Idk how I ended up having to get a random oil change but whatever
1628 2018-12-27 21:09:58 huge...super huge disconnect...oil price ok...indx is a bloody mess
1629 2018-12-27 21:09:42 LMAO, smelling like potato salad all week!! 

Argan oil has been my go-to for deep conditioning and also the herbal/organic hair dyes.
1630 2018-12-27 21:09:31 we’re set to run out of coal in 110 years, with gas & oil going a lot sooner than that. unless Putin pulls a fast one, don’t think we’re gonna be gone by then!
1631 2018-12-27 21:09:30 Reminder: Leave lemon essential oil under your pillow and the NYE DogMom will cure one of your pets of heartworm.
1632 2018-12-27 21:09:29 Decided to spoil my car today. Oil change and car wash. Even though she’s getting a detail next week 
1633 2018-12-27 21:09:28 Yaga, bony of the bath in the girl was near, she poured oil on us."
1634 2018-12-27 21:09:28 Damn how long does it take to change ya oil, you must have a list of stuff do do afterwards
1635 2018-12-27 21:09:15 True there isn't. 
Reality is Nigeria is losing land to
1. Desertification
2. Coastal encroachment
3. Oil spillage
Also losing access to land because of tribal,religious & terrorist crisis
Add to this low soil fertility due to over grazing, chemical abuse etc
1636 2018-12-27 21:09:15 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
1637 2018-12-27 21:09:05 Yes. Daughter of a mechanic. He made sure I knew how to do these basic things (plus check fluids in the car too) before I started driving. I can change my own oil too.
1638 2018-12-27 21:08:52 i was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna
1639 2018-12-27 21:08:50 The fact of whether Zarif cares more about IRI or the country of Persia remains to be determined.  What is more obvious and more relevant is that Amrika cares only about itself, oil and Israel.
1640 2018-12-27 21:08:44 Andrew will always prioritize fossil fuel industry interests over Canadian interests. His main focus is on short term oil and gas profits regardless of the climate crisis we all face together. His party's policies are reckless and dangerous for all of us.
1641 2018-12-27 21:08:33 Humbly?! I love you Thom but you and humble are like oil and water. They don't mix. 
1642 2018-12-27 21:08:19 His role was to weaken & destabilize the gov. #GOP starved the gov & programs of funds, shifted wealth to 1%. Maintain oil dominance & global warming as war tactic.
1643 2018-12-27 21:08:05 Lower oil prices doesn’t reflect at the pump immediately,
1644 2018-12-27 21:08:01 This report is not going to help Alberta, high gas price lead to low demand lead to Alberta oil related job cut. Senior petroleum analyst = some guy.
1645 2018-12-27 21:08:01 At last !! Oil down and stocks up ! It took investors an awful long time to get the (negative) sign of the correlation right ! Has common sense come back ? Much lower oil prices will lead to huge savings in 2019, great news for consumers.
1646 2018-12-27 21:07:58 Have you look into the cannabis oil or medical marijuana? It may be an alternative
1647 2018-12-27 21:07:52 I think the US EIA needs to be better at defining these streams, and the oil industry needs to stop fudging with NGLs and those bullshit BOEs.
1648 2018-12-27 21:07:47 It was the same price to move oil out of Alberta in 2015 when the disparity was $10-$15 per barrel....try again
1649 2018-12-27 21:07:44 No chance someone got wind of the giant stock buy program about to hit and ran oil up 40 points from the days lows in the closing settlement period-naaaa coincidence(again)!  #OOTT
1650 2018-12-27 21:07:21 Minister Sohi asked the NEB to examine issues pertaining to oil production from the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin versus current pipeline takeaway capacity. NEB reports today that production exceeds capacity by 365,000bbl/d. /2 #cdnpoli #cdnpoli
1651 2018-12-27 21:07:18 This is about oil.
1652 2018-12-27 21:07:18 Instead of kandi this year we are doing essential oil bracelets 
1653 2018-12-27 21:07:14 No alternative to oil is needed if oil is the best energy source.

The best energy source considers cost, reliability, availability.

Capitalism would encourage entrepreneurial people to try to find better sources of energy naturally due to incentives being aligned.
1654 2018-12-27 21:07:05 Looks like Nylon, this jacket is the reason why the oil prices rise.

1656 2018-12-27 21:06:54 When HOF's Flaxseed Oil Wing opens, he's a unanimous choice.
1657 2018-12-27 21:06:44 no no.  Your point was that poorer countries should have access to oil.  thy do.  its expensive.  My point is renewables solve that problem which is why there is so much investment in renewables.  But you seem to see that as oppressing the poor?

1660 2018-12-27 21:06:30 Isn’t there any Neruoligist’s in the IE that will work with CBD Oil for children with Refactory Epilepsy ?! Instead of saying we Don’t recommend it for children / and want to give more Pharmaceuticals?!!! That do not work for some kids!! @FEpilepsy @epilepsysociety @EpilepsyFdn

1662 2018-12-27 21:06:11 I tried it the one time to deal with my wavy hair. Couldn't stand the smell afterwards, which is why I only did it the one time. Going poo free and finding the nirvana which is argan oil helped so much when I had long hair.

1664 2018-12-27 21:05:53 i landed and my skin automatically became so dry i've been using rose hip oil on it every hour and it just drinks it up and gets so dry again
1665 2018-12-27 21:05:49 Ocasio is us. We want schools & doctors for our $.  

$100-million a year Senators & Congressmen exist to manage laws, resources & our $. 70-yr old politician-hookers help multi-mills/multi-bills, purge voter rolls, cheat Native Americans, give $300B oil, $1B coal, $867B Big Ag.
1666 2018-12-27 21:05:46 is inhaling mint essential oil for prolonged periods of time dangerous? asking for a friend
1667 2018-12-27 21:05:38 If oil is too expensive for porer countries there should be alternatives which is what renewable energy is and it's why India is spending billions to make itself 76% renewable by 2022
1668 2018-12-27 21:05:19 what this heatmap shows is all the big resource producers have incomes that a third or half what they should be compared to the wealth of the country. 

Turkey same, so maybe its not oil that is the key, but dictator in charge that makes the difference...
1669 2018-12-27 21:05:10 I have no idea what the hell you are talking about mate ! Oil did you buy oil and get it in the post, no you buy real oil at the garage like the rest of us. EToro said to me I was buying CFD at the time... then later the asset. I don’t care really, as I am trading the price.
1670 2018-12-27 21:05:08 It’s not a real oil painting unless it has bits of fluffy stuck in it
1671 2018-12-27 21:04:58 International oil prices market might encounter many surprises in 2019.what is seen on the surface isprice movements, inventories and stock drawdown, supply, demand, exchange rates...However these changes might not match with what international oil market has experienced in the

1673 2018-12-27 21:04:52 I know how to do both, changed my oil once (but couldn’t remember how now if I tried ). Taught two ex boyfriends how to drive stick. One in my old 5 speed, one in my now 6. They’re useful skills I recommend everyone learn at some point.

1675 2018-12-27 21:04:46 On a whim, used the last of my ras el hanout spice mix on some fried halloumi with a little garlic oil and the combo is so so good. All little bits sweet, savoury, aromatic, peppery, garlicky and spicy at once. 
1676 2018-12-27 21:04:43 Harthill services on the M8 today: diesel westbound £1.37, e/bound £1.38. This shows the madness of Sturgeon's plan to base the Scottish economy on oil: a commodity so volatile that it's differently priced at the same services. Also it's going to run out in about 10 years.
1677 2018-12-27 21:04:42 I’m still wrapping my head around the oil royalty mess - albertans own the oil, royalty payments are our share of the oil profits. PCs dropped the rates from over 30% to ~5% - NDP haven’t changed them... but considering how much money has been collected, how are there poor here?
1678 2018-12-27 21:04:34 As much as I love a twitter debate with an oil painting (I refer to the anonymity you clearly enjoy on twitter)... I do believe we fundamentally agree in that the cuts to legal are not good for true justice. 
However, from my understanding of the bill the crime of which 1/2
1679 2018-12-27 21:04:19 “let’s see how long i can go without an oil change” is my fav extreme sport
1680 2018-12-27 21:04:17 Why, though? Lots of oil workers live in TX, so TX politicians will get oil workers' donations. Is there evidence that they are changing Beto's votes, or how he would act as POTUS? If I ran I'd take fossil fuel money, and I'd push hard for a carbon tax
1681 2018-12-27 21:04:10 We are lucky to be relatively rich, thanks to natural resources like gas, oil and hydro, but with stable governments, now a moderate conservative, we love the welfare. You are welcome! Americans have the same opportunity!
1682 2018-12-27 21:04:05 And who would change my oil, mow the lawn, pick up the dog poop, and hang things for me? I dont wanna do any of those things!
1683 2018-12-27 21:03:47 .... my car need a oil change bad
1684 2018-12-27 21:03:47 Why did he take it at all then? Wouldn't it have been just as easy for him to NOT have taken it?  And why did he so easily say all those nice things about fossil fuels if he's such a climate hawk? Why did he vote to open oil exploration offshore? Why he vote to allow oil exports?
1685 2018-12-27 21:03:41 I taught my daughter to do these things including checking the oil. Relying on mechanics or significant others to do them is no different than boys not learning how to cook and do laundry relying on women to do them.
1686 2018-12-27 21:03:40 Yes but this has a little something to do with the collapse in the price of oil due to global growth concerns so the reasons for it going down are not the best. But yes axing the carbon tax helped.
1687 2018-12-27 21:03:38 Your confession doesn't sound genuine @MoiGideon in this clip. Your and @WilliamsRuto are just like oil and water.  Nevertheless, you guys need to burry your hatchets and form a stronger,  formidable Kalenjin Community.
1688 2018-12-27 21:03:35 Well done. I’ve replaced my dogs playing poker oil print with ‘Dogs betting Soccer. Win/win.
1689 2018-12-27 21:03:34 Guy: I'm just saying maybe CBD oil will be the magic cure

Me: He's literally gone now.

Guy: You seem stressed, maybe you both should try CBD oil.
1690 2018-12-27 21:03:27 Maaaan what beauty supply got the wild growth oil. Maybe I’m missing it bc the ones on the east of Birmingham I don’t be seeing it

1693 2018-12-27 21:03:13 My stomach hurts so bad, super nauseous, ask my bf if he has cbd oil.. he said no but has cbd dog treats if I can get them down
1694 2018-12-27 21:03:06 Australia in general seems to take the cautious approach, i.e like CBD oil. However unlike CBD people can import melatonin for personal use. Perhaps better alternative for all these, including low dose codeine (perhaps with ID) would be via pharmacist review?
1695 2018-12-27 21:03:04 idk but rub that white sticker with oil

1701 2018-12-27 21:02:23 Yesss
1702 2018-12-27 21:02:08 About two spoons of palm oil does it for me
1703 2018-12-27 21:02:07 My dad lied to me about paying for my oil change. K. Tnx bro.
1704 2018-12-27 21:02:05 We know from the Guardian that "the casino industry donated £8,000 to the IEA after it published a report calling for more casinos." And that your donors are "known to include tobacco, oil, alcohol and gambling companies or associations" Nice friends.
1705 2018-12-27 21:02:01 So how do you fix it if you don't provide an alternative to oil?

1713 2018-12-27 21:01:44 I believe he said "pipelines"!   Not oil.   I think Quebec politicians believe oil is delivered via the Stork.
1714 2018-12-27 21:01:42 Huckster, shyster, snake oil salesman! Just spin!  Drugs don't come across the border with wandering immigrants. Immigrants aren't  limited by a wall -- rafts, tunnels, etc. Most, by far, are not criminals, you racist! Quit tilting at windmills, moron!
1715 2018-12-27 21:01:38 Kenney’s chart does, yours is fake news. Don’t worry, if you don’t work in the oil industry and you live in Alberta, the trickle down will hit you at some point. Think of the record fuel prices we will hit if we eliminate the oil industry by idiots like you chasing them out.
1716 2018-12-27 21:01:21 Definitely getting a cold. Who wants to sell me a fraudulent snake oil instant cure?

1719 2018-12-27 21:00:59 See if anybody has a strap wrench or a small oil filter wrench and use it on the inner white part of the lid. Also is there supposed to be a foil seal underneath? Maybe somebody got carried away with the adhesive for that and it's glued on now
1720 2018-12-27 21:00:54 Dr. Snake Oil.  Give me money and I will pretend to be in control of the climate.
1721 2018-12-27 21:00:49 Working from home is dope af. I did all my laundry, gave myself a hot oil a hair treatment, had a sheet masking session, and snuggled with my puppers, all while catching up on paperwork and emails. 
What a life 
1722 2018-12-27 21:00:40 Maybe if the Wilpons were more forthcoming, and transparent, the fans wouldn’t hate these snake oil salesmen.

1732 2018-12-27 20:59:49 @CadburyUK - PLEASE FIND AN ALTERNATIVE TO PALM OIL. Can you imagine the press and increased sales you would get from being palm oil free?? Surely more than the R&D costs. Do it before it is too late! YOU have the POWER to enact real CHANGE.

1740 2018-12-27 20:58:41 Another hole in your Nat Observer article is the price disparity for CDN WTI product. Since it isn’t processed like the oil sands, is the same product as Texas, why didn’t they explain the INCREASED disparity for our WTI product...their theory just doesn’t make any sense.
1741 2018-12-27 20:58:41 How about a streetcar plastered with "The Carbon Tax will save us from Saudi oil".

1746 2018-12-27 20:57:50 True, but what's sad is that Russell and Sekera wouldn't be much more than 4-5 D on any other team..  Chairelli had options this year once Sekera went down again to acquire a Top 4.. if the Oil are out of a spot before the deadline, he needs to be fired

The energy is step 1.

They are poor due to their government and economic system.

This leads to the inability to afford oil.

Both things need to be fixed to begin to thrive.

1762 2018-12-27 20:56:29 i typically dont hedge...u got to figure that out urself....I hold these positions until big waves are done...for example...been shorting oil since early part of 2018....my avg cost on wti oil is at $72...I still have not sold ....I will sell when wti goes below $26...

"they are NO LONGER driven by economic fundamentals like earnings or eps or commodity supply & demand" ... the REASON = MANIPULATION
1782 2018-12-27 20:53:54 Sure love searing my flesh with hot bacon oil. Nothing more relaxing than getting a chance to scream at the top of lungs.
1783 2018-12-27 20:53:54 Treating all oil industry workers like they’re all on the board of Halliburton is disingenuous at best
1784 2018-12-27 20:53:45 Because they are working for companies that are destroying the planet. This is not unreasonable. They're Oil executives. If you think they're donating max donations to him because they care in good faith about the environment, you're extremely gullible.
1785 2018-12-27 20:53:36 Is this meant to be a thing of pride that 50years after the discovery of Oil in Nigeria we still import Petrol. It is a thing of shame to all our leaders past and present.

1789 2018-12-27 20:52:57 I’m surprised our regulatory agencies are dead silent about the massive price moves after the Fed meeting. We all know it’s algo’s...  but with so many funds using this strategy we have zero diversification. Oil, tech, staples... Everything has been moving in the same direction.
1790 2018-12-27 20:52:52 12/27/2018 NOW'S THE TIME TO BUY LOW ON OIL STOCK AND WAIT FOR IT TO GO BACK UP AND CASH IN AT T.D. AMERITRADE LATER WHILE WATCHING
THE WALL STREET JOURNAL'S STOCK MARKET REPORT DAILY FOR MAJOR
INCREASE.
1791 2018-12-27 20:52:45 Other than the orig. indigenous tribes, Japan did not engage in whale hunting until just a couple of hundred years ago, & at the instruction & urging of America, who employed them to supply us with Whale Oil. The meat was only used as a staple after WWII, for obvious reasons.
1792 2018-12-27 20:52:42 Helps get smooth and oil free skin: Beat one egg-white until stiff w/ lemon juice. Apply on your skin for 20 mins. Rinse w/ lukewarm water.
1793 2018-12-27 20:52:32 At pts I do think it was a driver but agree, oil mostly appears to be a lagging/reacting asset of late. Technically driven moves can still affect fundamental outlook but that’s all this appears to be...for now
1794 2018-12-27 20:52:24 Life skills. Basic cooking, taxes, changing a flat tire, checking oil, budgeting, sewing, ect.
1795 2018-12-27 20:52:20 Lazy af to go buy oil for my car.
1796 2018-12-27 20:52:13 I used to take 2:1 CBD-THC oil for nerve pain when I had herniated discs, and it completely relaxed me, took the pain away and I slept like a baby. Pretty sure it was indica. Definitely worth a shot.
1797 2018-12-27 20:52:05 Take a look at the $AAV and $TCW charts.  I'm currently in a $HNU trade, lots of gaps to fill to the upside on that chart as well.  #oil #gas
1798 2018-12-27 20:52:02 Forte Oil Chairman is Femi Otedola. Femi Otedola owns Forte Oil. Oga what are you talking about na?
1799 2018-12-27 20:51:43 Talking to an elderly man while getting my oil changed:
Him: what are you studying?
Me: Political Science
Him: *shakes head vigorously* no no
Me: I love politics
Him: *still shaking* go into business. This country’s gone to hell. 
What’s your other one?
Me: CJ and Spanish —->
1800 2018-12-27 20:51:40 I hear what you’re saying and I appreciate your direct experience, however that’s not what I’m talking about. What I’m referring to is years and years of baseless litigation. Especially considering it is the best way to transport oil.
1801 2018-12-27 20:51:23 This nigga tryna be cute and got baby oil in my shirt 
1802 2018-12-27 20:51:18 stop flaunting deutschland, i've been farming for her for so long my boats are getting pissed and I'm contemplating invading the middle east for more oil
1803 2018-12-27 20:51:17 Yaradua left and unfortunately even with high oil revenue, GEJ didn't think it was necessary to pay or corruption made them not pay, but the money was there. So don't say it's ASUU playing politics but GEJ then playing politics with the lives Nigerian students.
1804 2018-12-27 20:51:10 In the short term , use Canadian oil and gas i.e build local refineries and plant more trees to sequester carbon. The oil from Saudi Arabia or Nigeria is not green despite they have green national flags.
1805 2018-12-27 20:51:03 Oil sell-off is deepest to follow an #OPEC output cut in a decade: Crude’s recent sell-off is a… @environmentguru

1808 2018-12-27 20:50:52 Are you kidding? Iraq was all about bringing turmoil to the ME, weakening it, remaking a "New ME map"4 the sake of the expansion of Israel, and so that they &Israel take hold of the oil, and use Arabs as slaves(Zionist project)!
1809 2018-12-27 20:50:48 Oil executives and Walmart greeters is by far the worst analogy I've ever heard in my entire life. You should get a trophy for that.

1813 2018-12-27 20:50:12 So they have 2 options, slow it down/enforce a international law, or let you come in close it up, and make everyone enforce a international law, destroy your homelands military, own you with oil and switch to electric and nuceluar, and you killed us with drugs, for who?  Mexico?
1814 2018-12-27 20:49:58 Try olive oil brand edge control sis. I swore by that shit in high school. Kept my hair snatched for dance.
1815 2018-12-27 20:49:44 One time this guy was being super friendly while I was getting an oil change and I thought I possibly met a new friend and then he hit me with some pyramid scheme shit after a week and I was mad af.
1816 2018-12-27 20:49:34 Pull your head out of the sand and realize that we’re selling all of our oil to the US at a massive discount, refining Saudi Oil on our east coast, and faceless troll accounts like you continue to advocate unicorn industries and protest pipelines. Ever hear of a silent majority?

1818 2018-12-27 20:49:29 Still can’t that that interview on Marr out of my head from a few years back - Mandelson cooing over his little protege as they launched Chukka’s risible leadership bid. The oil was dripping off all three of them.

1827 2018-12-27 20:48:29 He takes money from big oil after he said he wouldn't, he votes with Trump, he's not what he makes himself out to be, need I say more.
1828 2018-12-27 20:48:26 "So it is very true, this, master musician. So it is very true."

The smell of the oil is pungently floral, but oddly it does seem to help with Daugh's nausea. 

The diplomat bows. "Forgiveness for intruding I beg."
1829 2018-12-27 20:48:03 Hello Donald, friend. Maybe concentrate on not destroying economy. Low oil price is killing mother Russia.
1830 2018-12-27 20:48:00 My cuteness is like if it is fired in boiling oil and then was thrown in oven for 1 hour at full temp  
You don't want to see.

1838 2018-12-27 20:46:42 Recycling 1 plastic bottle not only reuses the oil it is made from, it saves enough energy to power a 60 watt light bulb for 3 hours! For best recycling, sort paper into one box; and put all containers (plastic bottles, cans, cartons, jars) into a second bb.
1839 2018-12-27 20:46:39 Nope , BC and Quebec don’t want pipeline there will be twice the trucks and trains transporting oil . Get ready for carnage when they wreck .

1842 2018-12-27 20:46:18 Haha oh hey! Try "Carbona" - you may have to blot it a few times to get it all out.
You can find it on the laundry aisle with the stain removers. They have formulas for different stains, so pick the one for oil.

1843 2018-12-27 20:46:17 There's NOW ground swell support 4 Alberta Oil.  Public finally demanding answers why #JustinTrudeau boots on the neck of Alberta's (auditable) while importing (blood) oil from Saudi & Algeria.  #Twofaced - no issue dealing with Kings that cut heads off of feminist for pleasure
1844 2018-12-27 20:46:14 You can use castor oil! Speeds up the process of growing back
1845 2018-12-27 20:45:58 Democrats must weed out "media assets" who are really "media asses". Too many neophyte media shills are damaging the brand, keeping Bad News Beto in the headlines at a time when his shadow is growing longer by the day. O'Rourke uncorked, Oil of Oy Vey. Broken pinata, no candy.
1846 2018-12-27 20:45:23 Will history repeat itself. Standard oil trust, Mom bell are reminding me of Google, Amazon, Face Book, Twitter all looking like Monopolies. It’s time to break up these companies to create open competition.
1847 2018-12-27 20:45:18 front breaks barely working, oil life is in the negatives, tire pressure won’t leave & i just don’t have time to fix the shit 
1848 2018-12-27 20:45:18 Oh, and world oil prices just hit an eighteen-month low. Is the Premier claiming responsibility for the drop?
1849 2018-12-27 20:45:17 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1850 2018-12-27 20:45:12 Fact you're where you are cause of oil money 3rd 
1851 2018-12-27 20:45:11 A clear & urgent reason for us to cut back on fossil fuel burning - esp. oil, petrol & coal. We can all:
• switch to greener / renewable energy providers @ecotricity @bulbenergy etc
• get rid of diesel engines
• walk, cycle, carpool
• fly less; offset flights @worldlandtrust

1856 2018-12-27 20:44:53 Venezuela also is giving up a lot of their oil to China. 
China is going to take down a large number of 3rd world nations esp any of those on the belt.
1857 2018-12-27 20:44:50 bones don’t turn to oil
1858 2018-12-27 20:44:32 Today's "Fingerprints of the Fed". DOW recovers over 500 points while Russell 2000 still down big as well as oil.
1859 2018-12-27 20:44:30 Oh my, it seems it was over-deleted and got all shriveled up. *sigh* What else is there to do. Some salt, and pepper, and olive oil, plip-plip-plop 
1860 2018-12-27 20:44:28 On top of that, did you miss how he saved those people on the oil rig or the bus? Didn’t look like flight or superspeed to me but I’m pretty damn positive that he would have been able to withstand a tornado the same way. Everyone there would have seen him do it. Super simple.
1861 2018-12-27 20:44:21 OIL ?!
1862 2018-12-27 20:44:09 I use Jergens with coconut oil it’s the one with the brown lid, or almond oil.
1863 2018-12-27 20:44:09 Believe that’s reason  @MichaelCohen212 was in Prague to finalize deal. Don’t forget Trump Tower Moscow was a separate deal. Drill baby drill!  It’s all about the oil. Putin needs sanctions lifted.
1864 2018-12-27 20:44:02 Gentleman
1865 2018-12-27 20:44:02 Sure. So America turns its back on the world and cedes the oil rich eastern half of Syria to Iran and his Russian friends.
1866 2018-12-27 20:43:58 ...country in the Middle East. There are rich elements such as oil, petrol and tourism areas in the territory, where are all benefits from these sources? I heard that citizens haven't received their retirement salary over 15 months.

1869 2018-12-27 20:43:39 The real reason why i take forever in the shower is because it takes me so long to decide whether or not i want to use gel, oil or foam to wash my body, and also which scent i feel like using that day

1872 2018-12-27 20:43:03 Doing more, quicker and with the same resources is usually a recipe for disaster. I’ve seen the results when I was working in the environmental department for a major oil/gas producer.
1873 2018-12-27 20:42:53 oil to follow? 
1874 2018-12-27 20:42:51 Marinade had Worcestershire Sauce, Parsley, Salt, Black Pepper, Garlic & Ginger paste, BBQ sauce, Seasoning, abiit of Oil and Boom...finesse indeed!
1875 2018-12-27 20:42:51 Interesting tidbit in there that the increased demand is partly because of a switch to grid electricity from diesel generators... By oil and gas producers.
1876 2018-12-27 20:42:50 No! No no no! Earlier, someone joked about adding anchovy oil to freshly squeezed orange juice and there just HAD to be a cousin to that recipe!

1879 2018-12-27 20:42:42 I could send you several examples of people downplaying Beto getting $200+ donations from individuals that work at oil companies, or his conservative voting record being excused as "he's in Texas!" Despite representing the bluest district in the state.
1880 2018-12-27 20:42:42 @UpNorthTheFilm_ what time will the film be priemier at @film_house_benin?
1881 2018-12-27 20:42:18 I find they almost never provide them unless you ask, but I gotta ask. Lo mein ain't the same without it. Def plastic over metal if you gotta fork tho, so I hear ya there. Just goes so well with the oil lol.
1882 2018-12-27 20:42:13 Squeaks need oil.
1883 2018-12-27 20:42:11 you can deep fry in olive oil (we do) -- just add a piece of carrot to the frying oil.  The carrot will turn black and the oil will stay clear and good.

1886 2018-12-27 20:41:49 Lol it’s actually hair oil but it’s name is literally “weed”
1887 2018-12-27 20:41:47 We don't drink oil.  We don't breathe smog.  Our houses aren't  burned. Solar isn't cheaper than gas, It takes energy to build roads, including asphalt a by product of oil production, Flint caused its own problems.
1888 2018-12-27 20:41:46 I'm at a liquor store next to an oil refinery my grandpa used to work at in rural Delaware and the dude behind the counter is wearing a Pickle Rick shirt. This feels like local gothic
1889 2018-12-27 20:41:45 Like oil and water
1890 2018-12-27 20:41:43 A lot actually. Access bank,  guiness, forte oil..are just a few ..... 
Pls use Google and stop making unfounded claims.
1891 2018-12-27 20:41:35 Oh and I know some female plumbers,  a firefighter and one woman that works on the oil rigs. And everyone has been told women don't do these jobs, can't do these jobs and shouldn't do these jobs. That's society for you.
1892 2018-12-27 20:41:26 Now coconut oil not for me hair. It works for some people hair though lpl
1893 2018-12-27 20:41:21 @7ElevenCanada why In the hell do you guys not have 5w20 oil in stock ever!!!???  I’ve beeen to numerous stores no oil funnels either!!!!  So dam Inconvenient!!!
1894 2018-12-27 20:41:10 Fake News, the gas prices are low because the price of oil has collapse on international markets.
1895 2018-12-27 20:41:09 EVERYTHING. Anything savory that you'd use butter or vegetable oil to do. Make cornmeal/wheat flour pancakes no sugar, bacon grease and minced bacon in the batter. Use it for spinach and cheddar scones instead of butter. Reserve it and use it for spaghetti carbonera. GO.
1896 2018-12-27 20:41:07 Thieves oil on feet. Cotton ball of alcohol taped over belly button.
1897 2018-12-27 20:41:06 Perhaps you are educating yourself to be sure. Issues of amnesty is different from 13% that is due to people from oil region. 13% goes to state govt to support their developmental phase ok. Amnesty is FD initiative to deal with the unrest among the militant. Seek knowledge ok
1898 2018-12-27 20:41:01 Got an oil change and getting my new tires next week my lil lady gonna be a new bitch 
1899 2018-12-27 20:40:51 I feel like MLPs are always the whipping boys of tax loss selling. I’d bet MLPs have a big Jan no matter what oil does
1900 2018-12-27 20:40:45 If it uses Synthetic oil then that’s why
1901 2018-12-27 20:40:41 If you lived on a deserted island would it be a great idea to take shipments of oil or to try to innovate in energy and spend 50 years in abject poverty?

I'd rather get oil first and create a sustainable economy then focus on renewable energy like America did...
1902 2018-12-27 20:40:34 @colstonsrepairs you do oil changes in Camaros?
1903 2018-12-27 20:40:11 It’s nothing to do with slogans - they’ve been social democrats since the 1930s. The significant economic difference between Norway and the other Scandinavian countries is oil.

1915 2018-12-27 20:39:06 EVs are a threat to the oil industry, end of story.
1916 2018-12-27 20:38:56 Does the tin man have a sheet metal cock I say  for another oil and glitter show
1917 2018-12-27 20:38:37 na, but my mom put kusum oil on my head before.
1918 2018-12-27 20:38:36 Model 3 for the win!  I know six months in I still smile every time I get to drive it.  My reasons for best car:

1. Safe for my family
2. Fun to drive
3. Good for the environment
4. Good for human health
5. No gas, no oil
6. Fuel and maint savings
7. Great design inside and out
1919 2018-12-27 20:38:34 I know this sounds dumb but I just changed the oil in my car by myself for the first time and I’m very proud of myself
1920 2018-12-27 20:38:25 Yes, people who are invested in these industries in Africa are told by white people that they should focus on renewable energy that they know is nowhere near as good as oil.

Africa has too much corruption and mismanagement.
1921 2018-12-27 20:38:23 there is no common sense and no mathematical logic to have a surplus in Q1 and Q2 of 2019, after the increase of world oil demand of 1.2M and a decrease of OPEC+ and Canada production. Even if we add 1 million of increased oil production, the math isn't right.
1922 2018-12-27 20:38:14 I’ve been in solitude praying about this upcoming year and what the Holy Spirit is guiding me through. If I can sum it all up, “Alignment”. If I am in alignment, the oil will flow in every area of my life.

1924 2018-12-27 20:37:33 Lol better remain silent else with the info at NY disposal , we can tender them as receipt in the court if TL
1925 2018-12-27 20:37:20 Totally agree.  A lot of bad choices made, mostly for Coporate reasons.  The UK govt. didn’t want the oil nationalized in Iran so the CIA helped stage the coup.  Hence, we overthrew a democratically elected Mosaddegh & installed the Shah.  So much for us being for democracy, huh?

So is Rosneft oil piece
Treason 

Four people spoke with McClatchy on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of information shared by their foreign intelligence connections. Each obtained their information independently from foreign intelligence connections.
1928 2018-12-27 20:37:09 There are many more important matters than a tax credit. Deficit, unemployment, billions of investment dollars leaving the country not to mention giving the U.N. control of our country, how about 12.00/bbl Canadian oil? Why import Saudi oil???
1929 2018-12-27 20:37:07 UN report found C price to meet Paris would need to be set between $135 & $5,500/t.  Av price among countries that have carbon tax now $8/t. 
So it’s efficient at sending a price signal. But no govt will make oil unaffordable as they risk being tossed by voters. So it’s a fail!
1930 2018-12-27 20:37:03 Yea i can agree with you on this about the prison system. As far as Saudi Arabia goes they have oil and they use that for there advantage. They have daily public beheading we don’t
1931 2018-12-27 20:37:02 To you maybe, but his record is obviously greater than the recent scrutiny into his oil & gas votes, & looking at his overall record, it’s not unfair to characterize him that way. It’s so backwards that you’re angry at people learning this & not the politician for voting this way
1932 2018-12-27 20:36:57 Lots of reasons but the main one I believe is what they personally gain from not doing the right thing. No plastic drastically reduced use of oil & profits for their friends.
1933 2018-12-27 20:36:50 We're going to need all the productive farm land we can get if we're going to survive #Brexit & peak oil.
1934 2018-12-27 20:36:46 Crude oil futures for February reverse & head even lower Thursday afternoon, $WTI_Crude -2.34% at $45.14 & $NBZ_F -3.23% at $52.71, $USO -3.38% at $9.58 on 12/27/2018.

1937 2018-12-27 20:36:28 Sending the Saudi crown prince to the Hague to stand trial, for murdering civilian journalists? West not demanding it? Why not? Oil and money perhaps? Capitalism...
1938 2018-12-27 20:36:21 It's almost like they're pandering to another group than the actual voters. You know, the ones with the money and the oil.
1939 2018-12-27 20:36:18 Wondering if maybe there will be an effort to support oil prices soon... generate a big short-cover move in oil/oil-service names soon.
1940 2018-12-27 20:36:11 My daughter once emptied a full 2 gallon cooking oil all over the kitchen floor. Then lay in it. 
1941 2018-12-27 20:36:07 Have y’all ever used neem oil before?? It’s the worst oil I’ve ever smelled
1942 2018-12-27 20:36:05 @UmActuallyShow You stated cast iron can not be washed with soap as it will remove the seasoning. This is a misconception as the seasoning was oil, and soap bonds with oil. In reality, seasoning is polymerized and soap won't bond with it. So you're safe to use soap on cast iron.
1943 2018-12-27 20:36:01 Bitches need they oil changed be having a new nigga every week

1948 2018-12-27 20:35:46 Since water is worth more than oil in Saudi why don't they clean out some of the OPEC oil ships and go to the South Pole get ice put it in the hold after breaking it up take it back to Saudi? Sell it off auction it off or California get funding for that since they are on fire
1949 2018-12-27 20:35:44 It’s not a matter of if oil comes back, it’s a matter of when $UWT $USO

1952 2018-12-27 20:35:10 Venezuela’s problem is not just oil.  Even when oil prices were high in 2013, Venezuela was already going bankrupt and people were starving.  Socialism has failed everywhere it is tried.  Capitalism has succeeded everywhere it is tried.  History proves this.

1964 2018-12-27 20:33:58 The US is the largest oil producer in the WORLD. We are the ONLY country on the planet that can be 100% self-sustaining. We export food and money to a ton of countries around the world, and now oil.

1972 2018-12-27 20:32:55 Well clearly he’s lying and you’re right lower gas price is not mainly because of carbon tax but slumping global oil prices

1977 2018-12-27 20:32:37 You are a hypocrite for fighting oil while using it and its products.
1978 2018-12-27 20:32:31 If anyone has peppermint oil you can sniff it. Helps me with regular headaches and nausea. 
Also for the future, Young Living "PanAway" seems to help at least one person I know who has migraines. It's a little pricey ($60-70) but might be worth investment.

1999 2018-12-27 20:29:40 Standard Oil -  Buy the land, drill for the oil, refine the oil in your facility, load it into your tankcars, deliver using your locomotive on the railways you own. Bankrupt competitors by not selling them tankcars or rail service. Effective business model.

2009 2018-12-27 20:27:57 Maybe. The meats are not the problem. And neither is white rice in moderation. Biggest improvement would be to stop using seed oils for cooking. Use EVOO, avocado oil, tallow, ghee.
2010 2018-12-27 20:27:50 When oil prices swing wildly, the Canadian/Albertan petro dollar goes with them. When oil goes down, Alberta does badly, but a lower Canadian dollar is good for the Canadian economy. When oil goes up, it's good for Alberta, but the dollar going up is bad for the Canadian economy.
2011 2018-12-27 20:27:48 I’m not all fancy with the meats. I just sauté my cabbage in a little olive oil.

2060 2018-12-27 20:22:56 Nah, being on twitter, instead of changing my oil filter on my truck, is a waste of time.  it’s a fun thing, check it while I’m watching tv in the evening, more than likely.
2061 2018-12-27 20:22:56 There’s nothing wrong with that baby hair. All he need is curling cream, a lil water and some oil. You can easily tell he has 3B 3C hair. You need patience and YouTube. Of course he gonna cry , he learning to get his hair done. 30min is nothing compared to most black hair.
2062 2018-12-27 20:22:55 KMI is way more tied to oil also has some crappy businesses like barges
WMB owns the most valuable pipeline in the country 
also WMB is cheaper
2063 2018-12-27 20:22:51 I agree but we shouldn’t just rush off men to their untimely death. Let’s get those who are well trained and ready for this to deal with the immediate issues while we pursue long term solution
2064 2018-12-27 20:22:41 Truffle oil is way too over used. Just a small sprinkling goes a loooong way.
2065 2018-12-27 20:22:32 This fake news is so absurd it rates up there with the fact that Hollywierd elites claim Canadian oil is world's dirtiest. I'm shocked that #CBC hasn't called one of their crack investigative reporters from happy hour to get on this
2066 2018-12-27 20:22:26 Would the car just prompt you to change oil after a given mileage though? What would the difference be- just less frequent?
2067 2018-12-27 20:22:25 I finally got my hair tested and apparently i need LESS coconut oil in my life because my hair is protein sensitive and gets dryer because coconut is too heavy. :( i've been doing it all wrong oop. But apparently avocado and almond oil could be my lifesavers.
2068 2018-12-27 20:22:24 LMFAOOOO why Ms.Sally at work spraying my braids with oil sheen
2069 2018-12-27 20:22:21 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
2070 2018-12-27 20:22:21 Do you honestly that the relationship between our countries is one sided?  Do you consider the amount of resources you need from Canada? Energy? Water? Most of your oil imports are from here as well. How much longer do you think you could be self sufficient with your population?
2071 2018-12-27 20:22:15 Ugh why does getting my oil changed take so long. #annoyed #itsbeen90min #canihavemywarrantyandgotoquickstop
2072 2018-12-27 20:22:11 to no alarm clock!

- non judgmental observation
- intermittent fasting
- carb/sugar/seed oil restriction (grt for dental hygiene too)
- regular workouts, even when i don’t like it
- less self-conscious
- listening w/o respond/react-ing quickly
2073 2018-12-27 20:22:07 It is in my line of work. That post may have been from 2010 but by 2001 you could have found 200 people already warning about ill fated agricultural policies. But nobdoy cared because oil would provide.
2074 2018-12-27 20:21:46 They are always created, because a discovery always requires a creative act and more often a technological breakthrough (see oil well technologies and refining or improvements in cargo shipping - container).
2075 2018-12-27 20:21:40 Ontario never had a carbon tax. Oil is at what, $40/barrel. Since you cancelled drive clean, how about putting that money back in my pocket because one way or another the taxpayers were funding the testing.
2076 2018-12-27 20:21:25 Our government has failed us on a provincial and federal level.  The ndp got in because people were tired of the cons and their failures.  All of canada has recieved huge benefits from "Alberta's oil".  I just dont understand why we bring in outside oil and landlock our own
2077 2018-12-27 20:21:21 CARICOM LES DIJO HASTA AQUI NOS TRAJO EL RIO..se acabo el Oil...se acabo la chequera  negritos del Caribe  con Guayana y ...rechazaron a Nicols..Se acabo el Amor ♡ de tanto usarlo.." el Amor y el Interes se fueron al campo un dia y mas pudo el interes q' el amor q' le tenia" !

2095 2018-12-27 20:19:56 Yes I know it’s legal and I know it’s not a secret.... it’s lobbying. And they do use that money personally so I’m asking you... are they taking money from oil to keep it alive and taking money from carbon tax to push it down?

No more bombings in Abuja. Boko Haram on the run. Recovering looted billions. Who is he blaming again?

2113 2018-12-27 20:18:41 Socialism! When you take over private enterprises and install friends to manage those public enterprises it goes to shit. The oil industry was producing at a good rate. So much so Venezuela was sending fuel oil for heating in the US free. Now his people are starving and leaving!

2119 2018-12-27 20:18:11 wind farms and solar, just a bit cleaner.  Plus can bankrupt Russia if we stop using as much oil.
2120 2018-12-27 20:18:07 Idk why I forget how my car works whenever I get an oil change. The guy says “turn on your blinker” and all of a sudden I forget what a blinker is and I turn on my windshield wipers
2121 2018-12-27 20:18:07 Listen I know for sure my tribe was included to piss off Nigeria and cut them off from fuel bc we had oil. They carved up Biafra strategically so they can maximize the resources needed for the war.

2182 2018-12-27 20:10:38 We should absolutely be diversifying.  We should be shipping our oil coast to coast and using a % of the profits to grow other, self sustaining industries.  The oil dies every 5-7 years typically, but until the other industries are running oil is what we have.
2183 2018-12-27 20:10:20 Brent crude oil fell by US$2.31 or 4.2% to US$52.16 a barrel and the US Nymex oil price fell by US$1.61 or 3.5% to US$44.61 a barrel.

2191 2018-12-27 20:09:13 False. If the same Canadian standards were applied to world oil production, ghg emissions would fall by 23% per barrel produced or about 100 million cars worth.

2193 2018-12-27 20:09:01 Did you lock in a rate? Call your heating oil company or call around. Back when I had home heating oil and it dropped this amount, they'd reduce my rate but only if I demanded it.
2194 2018-12-27 20:08:48 They were persuaded by the #Brexit snake oil salesmen and the likes of the Daily Hate that their misfortunes were the result of the EU and foreigners, and not Anglo-American neo-liberalism that has seen wealth ‘trickle up’ from the masses to the 1% over the last 40 years.
2195 2018-12-27 20:08:23 Only machines in the world that don’t require oil/lube in some form to operate 
2196 2018-12-27 20:08:17 seriously?  yes, Richie Frankel and Co for about 3 years in Denver during the 1980's in the height of the penny stock oil craze.  managed 350m in individual issues for 10 years in the 90's. started a pure tech fund in 1994..private and public companies. now i teach people.
2197 2018-12-27 20:08:09 Olive oil in the bathroom !
2198 2018-12-27 20:08:03 Someone teach me how to change oil this shit is expensive 
2199 2018-12-27 20:07:50 for pasta, most bought tomato/herb sauces are vgn. or use a plant milk/vgn cheese to make a creamy one. v cheap to just add chick peas /kidney beans for protein. if i'm being fancy, i love to blend fresh garlic and herbs with olive oil to make an amazing fresh garlicky sauce 
2200 2018-12-27 20:07:45 Beto’s record:
1. Voted w/Trump 30% to deregulate banks, no to protect POC against loan discrimination, yes to racist anti-immigration policy & yes to weaken ACA.
2.  2nd largest recipient gas & oil $
3. Stated “false choice” to choose between renewables & fossil fuels #NeverBeto
2201 2018-12-27 20:07:35 Oil is volatile?
2202 2018-12-27 20:07:28 Hey @AskTSA, any restrictions on valve oil for musical instruments? Its under 100ml and fits in my bag for 3-1-1, but I want to make sure its not separately restricted.
2203 2018-12-27 20:07:27 They're hypocrites. They support the armoured vehicle contract, but not the oil.  Why? Because they can attack Trudeau with the oil.
2204 2018-12-27 20:07:15 I thought the cannabis oil was best for chronic pain. I’m not sure if it actually makes you sleep. But I am totally not an expert on this.
2205 2018-12-27 20:07:14 Chubby nice
2206 2018-12-27 20:07:12 The entire notion of the rapture doesn't even appear in the bible.  It was invented in the 1800s by a literal snake oil salesman turned preacher.
2207 2018-12-27 20:07:12 My reindeer nose on my car keeps hitting the guy changing my oil on the head. I’m screaming
2208 2018-12-27 20:06:58 I'll try teem
2209 2018-12-27 20:06:58 Is he selling snake oil?
2210 2018-12-27 20:06:57 Bought my first vape pen and CBD oil today. I feel like this will really come in handy, it's a good day to try it out because my arthritis is killing me.
2211 2018-12-27 20:06:54 So true! Some of our customers were stunned when they first tasted our oil - people are not used to peppery, fruity, unrefined extra virgin olive oil!
2212 2018-12-27 20:06:50 Need oil change. Badly.
2213 2018-12-27 20:06:27 Yourself or your car??? I can help yourself to get your oil changed
2214 2018-12-27 20:06:09 CO2 als verdienmodel bestaat al meer dan 100 jaar.
- in frisdrank
- de aandeelhouders van Big Oil verdienen aan onbelaste uitstoot (zij pakken de baten, maar de wereld draait op voor de kosten)
2215 2018-12-27 20:06:00 Oil is "all" that matters right now
2216 2018-12-27 20:05:43 The unfortunate thing in our own war is we don't know the conveyor of the real truth.
We're just tossed in between narratives.
2217 2018-12-27 20:05:42 Gotta get my oil changed Frfr
2218 2018-12-27 20:05:17 They need to hurry up with my oil change. I’m hungry & getting aggravated ...
2219 2018-12-27 20:05:15 Oil changes and emission tests are a bitch too
2220 2018-12-27 20:05:04 About to get a CBD oil massage  so excited to treat myself
2221 2018-12-27 20:04:58 As I slowly assemble my 2019 macro missive I will try to reset a few widely accepted narratives that are flawed.
These relate to:
QE
Inflation
Vol
Cycle drivers
Tax Cuts

I'll also set the current/forward looking market narrative as it relates to:
GeoPol
USD
EM
OIL
Trade

2222 2018-12-27 20:04:55 When will you make one for Trump?

Non-french vanilla with bits of iron shavings and pebbles and a swirl of crude oil....call it: 'Tough as Nails' 

lololololol 
2223 2018-12-27 20:04:45 How are Bernie supporters being divisive?

If you consider being critical of someone's acceptance of oil/gas company donations and their Republican friendly voter record divisive, then you're part of the problem.
2224 2018-12-27 20:04:41 Guess im finna grab this baby oil
2225 2018-12-27 20:04:19 Tonight after missing isha'i prayer, we prayed behind a random guy, immediately he went fr ruku'u, his cloth revealed some amulets and waist shirk stuffs, I just cut out from d prayer.
Was it a right decision?
2226 2018-12-27 20:04:16 Clearly I don’t need to own a car because I don’t do anything but keep gas in it and get oil changes when the sticker tells me to.
2227 2018-12-27 20:04:09 i’m getting my oil changed and they’re taking long af so i was gonna go get some food but remembered i don’t have my truck :/
2228 2018-12-27 20:03:48 he dm’d me offering me some of his uncles cbd oil i asked for a cheeky reunion and got ‘ooo baby thats hot’ and details in return we love the iconic duo reuniting
2229 2018-12-27 20:03:36 Emery: 1 French League, 2 French Cups, 2 Europa Leagues

Wenger: 1 French League, 1 French Cup... 3 Premier Leagues, 7 FA Cups, 2 Doubles, an Invincible season, and came far closer to winning the Champions League on hardly any money than Emery did with oil money.
2230 2018-12-27 20:03:25 stay warm and to shorten ur period, coconut oil, it helps.
2231 2018-12-27 20:03:23 You are also allowing the oil sands to increase emissions to 100Mt in 2030 and you bought a pipeline to encourage them.
2232 2018-12-27 20:03:22 In 2008 we were not producing 12 million barrels of oil a day.  That makes a huge difference in the economy.
2233 2018-12-27 20:03:20 Also @MBuhari is the owner of Barclay's bank,  Arik Air,  major shareholder in Azman air, zenith bank,  he just bought diamond bank from access,  he has 25% shares of world bank, 7 oil wells, 2 refineries outside Nigeria, 150 cows just increased to 150mil cows, U will be alright
2234 2018-12-27 20:03:14 If you don’t have a oil diffuser you’re playing yourself
2235 2018-12-27 20:03:14 2.5hrs after starting my rear brakes and oil change appt and it’s finally done..what a waste of my life
2236 2018-12-27 20:03:14 War has many narratives but only one truth. War has many perspectives but only one realty.
2237 2018-12-27 20:03:04 Although, I certainly agree that it doesn't have to be the "camera brand" that defines the look. There are so many variables that can be authored and manipulated for desired results. That being said, it's easier to make an oil painting look like an oil painting... w oil paint.
2238 2018-12-27 20:03:00 Ooh. Wow! oil market correction will continue into New Year, four days from now. NBC loves drama.
2239 2018-12-27 20:03:00 I’d love to teach Pinker to cook bulgogi. Both him & Sam Harris. Imagine the conversations you could have with your hands drenched in soy sauce, sesame oil and beef blood. Then sitting at the table for hours, eating bancheon and arguing about the Lakers, LeBron, quantum physics.
2240 2018-12-27 20:02:58 Oh and/or an Epsom salt bath with some added lavender.  Just be sure your pores are closed before putting on the peppermint oil after a bath and if you've put it on before make sure to wash it off thoroughly.
2241 2018-12-27 20:02:49 Damn olive oil magnates and their "100 life hacks using olive oil". #BigOliveOil
2242 2018-12-27 20:02:40 Could have changed my own oil but .. I’m enjoying my off day
2243 2018-12-27 20:02:30 Truth is that the first oil well was drilled in 1858. Didn't take long to ruin this planet. Carry on defending it.
2244 2018-12-27 20:02:25 Pepper soup and Fura for the night 
2245 2018-12-27 20:02:09 In the art world there is so much focus on women as subjects. It's nice to see these oil paintings by David Tanner which feature men as subjects. What are your thoughts? :)
2246 2018-12-27 20:02:08 There is absolutely no rhyme or reason behind the very extreme fluctuations in gas prices which has been going on in Canada for at least 2 years. Seeing as most of our cost of gas is taxes, is it due to budgetary needs as well as availability of oil? One has to wonder.
2247 2018-12-27 20:02:06 How about if someone wants to use oil/gas/coal, they have to pay for the abatement of the pollution?
2248 2018-12-27 20:01:52 Went to bath and body works and they had the amber and Argan body mist  no oil tho  @Bathbodyworks17
2249 2018-12-27 20:01:50 yo ho ho and a bottle of olive oil!
2250 2018-12-27 20:01:46 Bruv are some oil tycoon in Kuwait or something?
2251 2018-12-27 20:01:37 checking my olive oil shares 
2252 2018-12-27 20:01:29 China gets Africa, Brazil,  Venezuela
Russia gets the 'stans,  Philippines.
Scandinavians, Germany, Netherlands try to straddle but get oil from Russia, products from China
UK and Canada will try neutral but will side with the US & get screwed
S Europe Fr. goes to Iran
Howd i do?
2253 2018-12-27 20:01:22 Indices have clawed their way back into 30m OR with exception of smalls (for now anyway). IMO oil is more important than smalls right now...just an opinion.
2254 2018-12-27 20:01:22 So, yet again the Olive Oil has mysteriously moved from the kitchen to the bathroom! Does anyone else have a teenage daughter who does this?
2255 2018-12-27 20:01:21 Come with my sister to get her oil change at 9:15(she had an appointment) and we’re still here waiting wtf @Nissan 
2256 2018-12-27 20:01:16 do i really need to get an oil change? like do i REALLY need it?
2257 2018-12-27 20:01:13 Just washed 5 separate vials of beard oil with all of my clothes. And yes they all opened.
2258 2018-12-27 20:01:11 I put an essential oil blend that would help me focus while I do my homework, but instead I feel tired
2259 2018-12-27 20:00:58 Only Man United, Chelsea, Arsenal, Everton, Tottenham & Liverpool have played every season of the Premier League. 

In other news, Man City were shit before Arab oil money!
2260 2018-12-27 20:00:58 Get teem toh or andrew liver salt , cos ur stomach go swell boom
2261 2018-12-27 20:00:50 When doing the things I said drink lots of water  too.  Getting an oil diffuser and loading it up with peppermint and lavender at night will help.  Put lavender behind your ears and a little down the center of your tummy. That will help relax.
2262 2018-12-27 20:00:37 the anti-horny task force, for especially heinous horny guy activities, brandon should feel lucky to have this dedicated group of individuals police him out of thirst traps and into the path of righteousness

2266 2018-12-27 20:00:09 I love how you categorize it, but everyone has an interest to his narrative.
2267 2018-12-27 20:00:08 This tweet, "RT WorldEnergyTrad: #FelizJueves Estos son los precios del mercado energético hoy #27dic #oil #price #business #gold #trading #marketing #…" hasn't been tweeted more than 1 times.
2268 2018-12-27 20:00:08 @RamTrucks it’s 2019 and you still haven’t figured out where to put an oil filter without making an unnecessary mess?
2269 2018-12-27 20:00:05 Art can be more than pictures of objects. Our students learned that from artist Jackson Pollock. They created their own drip paintings by combining water, oil, paint and sugar and dripping it onto their paper!
2270 2018-12-27 20:00:04 Nothing like letting Iran sell oil to multi-countries....  Guess who's sleeping in their bed......none other than Orange Head!!!  Lift a ban on Iran selling oil so it's dropped fuel prices..... But who really cares if we help Iran....or Russia....or North Korea....no pride left.

2274 2018-12-27 19:59:45 My favorite thing about the natural predators of Ultra posts is trying to figure which one got people, was it the tentacles, the oil crisis, Belial, the obscurity of Jackal, hell if I know, but y'all are eating it up
2275 2018-12-27 19:59:39 About half a pint and a decent pinch of salt. SMOKING hot oil in the baking tray as well.
2276 2018-12-27 19:59:38 Im waiting for the oil on my face to seep into the skin so I can sleep. Lol wait.  I'm rhyming...
2277 2018-12-27 19:59:37 Wall important to Trump for 2020 elections as he would look foolish to his voter base to whom he lied first, Mexico would pay for it now he blames it on Dems though he owned it publicly in front of Pelosi and Schumacher.
Trump just a oil conman!!!
2278 2018-12-27 19:59:35 Few drops of olive oil works wonders for a blocked ear.  I used to get them bad before
2279 2018-12-27 19:59:33 I needed and oil change about two months ago and still haven't gotten one
2280 2018-12-27 19:59:15 God bless your sense 
More oil to your head

I sure say no be only you sidown think this thing
2281 2018-12-27 19:59:03 Fossil fuels have been *running out*, since the start of using them. N Sea oil/gas could be extracted for 2 decades yet. 
Oil should stay in the ground as part of a climate strategy, whether Scotland is in UK or independent.
2282 2018-12-27 19:58:51 One of these days these action movie main characters won't give a shit about their ex wife and will happily leave her to die in her submarine/ oil tanker/ spaceship.
2283 2018-12-27 19:58:44 First day back from vacation.... the Tahoe is leaking oil and my car is completely dead!!! Does it ever end?
2284 2018-12-27 19:58:44 Indeed Trudeau is responsible - in your dreams. Did he single handedly cause the world price of oil to plummet? Did he make the Tar Sands oil not the most desirable product in the energy industry? He hasn't "hiked" taxes and anyone who opposes carbon tax is a criminal.

2287 2018-12-27 19:58:00 @hingst_jim hi mr. hingst.  great work!  read the page on linseed oil.  needs updating.  painters are using much better versions of the oil.  handmade or old school flaxseed oil instead of the toxic chemically cleaned and vacuum boiled linseed oil of the past.  Gamsol.etc.cheers

2290 2018-12-27 19:57:38 Starting today, my whole weekend is so busy. Working 2 shifts at the arena, 3 hours at day job, hair cut, pedicure, oil change, dog sitting, eyebrows, etc.
2291 2018-12-27 19:57:37 Glut of oil on market
2292 2018-12-27 19:57:34 Remains to be seen. Probably 3 sides to the story: ISWAP’s NA’s and the truth.
2293 2018-12-27 19:57:33 Are you kidding me. I go out to my car ready to get my hair cut, and it doesn’t turn on, and the engine & oil lights both come on too. Why is this all happening at once
2294 2018-12-27 19:57:28 I need some coconut oil
2295 2018-12-27 19:57:20 Your just pissed that someone stood up to you and told you NO! You're such a spoiled child, welcome to the real world where you don't get what you want, because "WE THE PEOPLE" won't back down, you were voted in and will be voted out!
2296 2018-12-27 19:57:07 @ImperialOil i recently received a job offer from this company via linkedin from a person named Whelan J. King Senior vice-president, upstream at Imperial Oil Canada says his profile. i was told to send my CV to mail id hr@imperialoilcanada.net .
2297 2018-12-27 19:57:04 I was going to fry some chicken tonight but i have no cookin oil  guess i will just make some more spaghetti or burgers
2298 2018-12-27 19:57:03 Oil price collapse crashed the market as in 2015 W double dip.
2299 2018-12-27 19:57:00 Stew’s gonna be on his death bed and I’m still gonna call him to take my car to get an oil change
2300 2018-12-27 19:56:44 getting car’s oil changed and the waiting room had @GottliebShow filling in on @TheHerd on. easily the worst hour of television i’ve ever seen, i looked forward to the commercials, would rather have my ears pierced than have to listen to that guy’s takes again #FS1
2301 2018-12-27 19:56:41 With the parboil and the shaky colander and the hot oil and such? I think I’ve finally cracked it myself too...!
2302 2018-12-27 19:56:38 can someone date me in 2019 I’m tired of being extra virgin olive oil
2303 2018-12-27 19:56:26 Thank you, I give at least some of the credit to going back to oil paint. That and all the effort...
2304 2018-12-27 19:56:22 Rotterdam effect is much more inward than outward.
I've read most outward is North Sea oil, refined in the Netherlands.
But the outward also just overstates the reliance on EU for trade.
2305 2018-12-27 19:55:53 Omg the first time I tried tofu it was scrambled in a butt tonne of oil, not pressed properly so it was super watery, and cooked with peppers and nothing else. There were situational things around this that made it v traumatizing but I haven’t had tofu since.
2306 2018-12-27 19:55:41 Lol they can buy you and add Jara , plus la'ada
2307 2018-12-27 19:55:26 Spend is accurate under Westminster regulations. Tax income is NOT. As Scotland has higher than population share of many of UKs most profitable exports (NOT OIL)these are vastly underestimated.
2308 2018-12-27 19:55:25 FWIW, while not a cure-all (nothing is), FECO (full extract cannabis oil) consumed orally has done wonders for some. Oral FECO is completely different than smoking it.
2309 2018-12-27 19:55:24 As a country we need to have an honest discussion regarding the mess that the oil industry in Alberta is in and how the industry is going to get out of it not tax payers. Also who is paying for the environmental damage done by the tailing ponds?
2310 2018-12-27 19:55:21 That should be coming soon.
2311 2018-12-27 19:55:06 No one told me that getting an essential oil diffuser would suddenly turn my bedroom into a 5 star spa resort ... I’m never leaving
2312 2018-12-27 19:54:58 With the china concentration camp situation its funny how the so called up right western world is not interested in invading, there is no oil, no benefit for them to masquerade behind the false pretenses they hide  behind. no ideology to fight? Not threatened bcuz islamz not ere?
2313 2018-12-27 19:54:52 @FieldRoast Hazel Nut Cranberry Roast, mashed potatoes made with melt, coconut milk, sprinkled with Himalayan pink salt and pepper, asparagus saluted in garlic olive oil, Flaky vegan rolls. For our dessert we had Daiya - Chocolate cheese cake.
2314 2018-12-27 19:54:49 I had them do an oil change too while they were at it, so that and the actual labor cost brought it up to $1091
2315 2018-12-27 19:54:40 I just dropped my oil painting down the stairs hows your day going
2316 2018-12-27 19:54:40 Now think about socialism as the mafia. You have to compete for the garbage to sift through to get your next meal. Meanwhile the socialist leaders divide up the oil and other resources among themselves.
2317 2018-12-27 19:54:35 No need of cooking oil even, yali nona kale
2318 2018-12-27 19:54:35 Hahahaha. YOU SHOULD TRY THE RECIPE TOO. AND THE OLIVE OIL THING
2319 2018-12-27 19:54:30 Then, accused us for being stubborn because we refused to join palm oil plantation.
2320 2018-12-27 19:54:30 Because against Cruz in Texas he's better. 

But honestly now that I know he took just a hair shy less than Ted Cruz from big oil we all dodged a bullet.
2321 2018-12-27 19:54:29 why don’t ya females put beard oil on your eyebrows, it’ll probably help it grow.
2322 2018-12-27 19:54:22 I mean, there's a constellation of think tanks funded by the oil cartels telling us that global warming is fake, but those two facts are completely irrelevant, and anyone seeking to connect them is clearly paranoid.
2323 2018-12-27 19:54:21 Nah, it was US foreign policy against socialist states. US destroyed the oil price on purpose. Always have that veto power on oil prices. Then outlawed trade with Cuba and Venezuela..You caused it..You are to blame. Shame on you US.. Your a mad, sick, nation...
2324 2018-12-27 19:54:19 Desperation is spraying magnesium oil on the soles of your feet after reading multiple sources about it improving sleep
2325 2018-12-27 19:54:17 Are there are house fires in your imaginary world? Any hurricanes with downed electrical poles and wires? Anyone use oil or gas or anything that needs to be mined or uses heavy machinery? Any roofs need repairing? Garbage removal that day? land mines being removed from war zones?
2326 2018-12-27 19:54:17 Maybe it's just me, but calling it money from "oil and gas industry" sounds like corporate PAC money, not individual donations.
2327 2018-12-27 19:54:10 Diesel, fuel filters, air filters, oil filters, oil and someone who can actually service it. If it’s a communal thing, no one will give a damn about it, just use it until it stops. What use is a trekker without implements.
2328 2018-12-27 19:54:09 I got a dent from somebody hitting me and my tire pressure light on. And I lowkey probably need to get my oil changed 
2329 2018-12-27 19:54:06 Okay but what about all the money that politicians take from oil and coal? Because that’s actually documented... both sides, left and right, are guilty of taking personal financial interests over the interests of the people.
2330 2018-12-27 19:54:06 Just a shout-out to all those traditional pieces I’ve binned over the years for being too textured, too waxy, too many pastel fibers, as I try to make this digital painting look as though it has bits of flecked off dust and chipped oil paint.
2331 2018-12-27 19:53:56 I’ve managed to go to work, go to my doctors appointment & drop off my car for an oil change all before 12! Who am I?!
2332 2018-12-27 19:53:48 What are you even talking about? Standard Oil did NOT increase prices, they kept lowering. Standard Oil was an efficient monopoly that did it right - was reliable and actually had good quality products at an affordable price. Around 1870, it had 4% market share
2333 2018-12-27 19:53:45 Oh no, the president who gloated about making the US the #1 oil producer during a climate crisis is getting criticized. It must be hate and cultism, which is definitely something that only motivate others and not me.
2334 2018-12-27 19:53:44 The squeaky wheel gets the most oil!
2335 2018-12-27 19:53:28 I'll wait till @HQNigerianArmy issue a statement
2336 2018-12-27 19:53:25 You are contradicting yourself again. QC has not refused western oil.
2337 2018-12-27 19:53:23 He is probably patting the mayor on the back for attacking the oil industry.
2338 2018-12-27 19:53:17 I think beard oil may contain toxins that damage the brain if it’s applied to beards that are too short because it gets soaked up through the chin into the skull or sutin
2339 2018-12-27 19:53:13 Crown Estate = Land stolen by ancestors.
The oil is running out, in around a 100years.
A small army, which is linked to humanitarian efforts is easily managed.
Your arguments are puerile and ill conceived.
2340 2018-12-27 19:53:12 To give them beauty for ashes, The oil of joy for mourning,
2341 2018-12-27 19:53:08 This morning I told a guy I used to date in Hawaii who is only on the east coast for like 24 hours that I have plans tonight so can’t go to a concert w him. 

My plans are to clean my fridge and watch Hulu with a diffuser of lavender oil and chamomile tea.
2342 2018-12-27 19:52:53 Oops sorry I misread.. thought said “baby oil”
2343 2018-12-27 19:52:48 @BettyCrocker want to make a cake mix calls for 1/2 cup oil can I substitute for butter and if so how much butter?
2344 2018-12-27 19:52:33 That beard butter is crazy and the beard oil is from art of shaving in the mall
2345 2018-12-27 19:52:31 And now why our Sarawakian natives fought for 'Pemakai Menoa' and 'Pulau Galau' NCR lands. Both are for sustainable environment purposes, yet, the state gov reluctantly recognised these lands and non-stop with palm oil business (which we hate)
2346 2018-12-27 19:52:24 There is no mercury in vaccines. There is no peanut oil in vaccines.
2347 2018-12-27 19:52:20 Beautycounter!! EWG approved too. The baby oil is amazing.
2348 2018-12-27 19:52:15 breaking a 1 gram full tank of oil be sad as hell
2349 2018-12-27 19:52:13 I’ve heard good things about the Jamaican black castor oil ! Hopefully i do good with being consistent  thank you so much
2350 2018-12-27 19:52:12 Beard oil is actually great, but you know what is less embarrassing? Just using conditioner on your beard regularly
2351 2018-12-27 19:52:08 The only primer ive ever liked is just rose oil bc it acts as an astringent too!! Its not for everyone but it keeps my makeup from getting cakey, helps it apply more smoothly and is good for ur skin  but again its not for everyone
2352 2018-12-27 19:52:06 
2353 2018-12-27 19:52:01 I went to get an oil change and these niggas TOOK OUT my air filter to show me I needed a new one, if this isn’t a violation of my Fourth Amendment
2354 2018-12-27 19:51:56 Aikin gama ya gama
2355 2018-12-27 19:51:51 Environmental issues like low carbon & the reasons you stated why oil companies were getting out of oil! Stick to the subject.
2356 2018-12-27 19:51:44 I dont have a lot of fears, but I do fear people who are financially unstable and also the people who dont change their oil every 6k miles.
2357 2018-12-27 19:51:30 รวมตัวคนไม่คาดหวังเเล้ว เพราะสิ้นหวังไปเเล้วจ้า
2358 2018-12-27 19:51:15 Jeez I have to get on oil change soon
2359 2018-12-27 19:51:13 anyone with a question: 
me: coconut oil
2360 2018-12-27 19:51:12 Well then, by all means. I wanted to try CBD oil for my depression and anxiety, but at $100 per bottle and no guarantee it will get to my home, I decided to stick with Lexapro.
2361 2018-12-27 19:51:11 Maybe your bro-in-law should spend some time on #OOTT. Need to compare size of oil market tos size of funds doing the "pushing around." Sure, a big fund make a difference for a moment but only a state can really move things & some even question that.
2362 2018-12-27 19:51:09 Maestros Beard Butter and shower scrub and my boy @NickFonseca77 just got me a nice beard oil but I don’t know the brand

2364 2018-12-27 19:50:42 Did you do the 1/2 tsp of oil? Mine recommends yhat for crispy fries
2365 2018-12-27 19:50:39 so my wife complains that my beard is too scratchy and I'm sitting here looking at a thing called "beard oil" which supposedly softens hair and I am earnestly willing to try this but there is not a single product in the entire category which would not make me die of embarrassment
2366 2018-12-27 19:50:29 depends how an oil and gas industry is "supported".  it would begin to wither if there were no subsidies...it's not a stand alone economy.
2367 2018-12-27 19:50:27 The old fashioned way of doing politics by same old politicians will never bring hope to Kenyans. These guys have stolen from Kenyans through all sectors...Oil,Gas,Electricity n Coffee is run by three families. #RailaOnCitizen
2368 2018-12-27 19:50:27 Winding down the day at work.

Scheduled an oil change + Maintenance on the car.

2369 2018-12-27 19:50:24 Hope you feel better if your belly is upset peppermint oil helps so much to settle it!
2370 2018-12-27 19:50:16 I’m not exactly sure! I’m not allergic to any oils so I didn’t read it, the bottle just said “anxiety relief essential oil”
2371 2018-12-27 19:50:13 Rice + beans
Rice + Sphags
Rice + Macroni
Rice + stew
Rice + Yam
Rice + "Mai da yaji" (pepper and groundnut oil)
2372 2018-12-27 19:49:56 “Tell you that they love you but ain’t loyal, they can keep that, they don’t want the soil, just the oil that’s beneath that”
2373 2018-12-27 19:49:48 More of that strange oil. It's probably nothing.
2374 2018-12-27 19:49:42 I forgot about that man oil up himself 
2375 2018-12-27 19:49:32 but it sucks because anything that has oil makes it worse :/
2376 2018-12-27 19:49:30 with most of Quebec shiting in the river I would think a little oil spill would add just a little diversity
2377 2018-12-27 19:49:29 Rangers can be Woodsmen, Military Scouts, or Cowboys (your companion is your horse!). Bards can be Musicians, Demagogues or Snake Oil Salesmen. Monks can be Martial Artists, Professional Wrestlers or Blood Bowl Players. The more abstract, the better!
2378 2018-12-27 19:49:26 if I go one more day without an oil change I'm gonna spray my load all over the fucking parking lot
2379 2018-12-27 19:49:16 sears didn’t even READ my tweet, plus my oil change was free soooo they ain’t getting my business today lmao
2380 2018-12-27 19:49:14 Genesis 2:6 is actually about oil, which is my manifest destiny for invading the western coast of Norway
2381 2018-12-27 19:49:14 I think the U.S. should pull out all their troops from the Midde East now that America is a net oil exporter. It can produce oil on its own. There is no reason for them to be there anymore.

Big Oil, Big Pharma, BIG Globalists & Deep State  caused the Venezuela crisis.
2385 2018-12-27 19:49:00 #JamesBarryDiary 27/12/1868 Very cold last night, but still calm. Cahill is away up the settlement this afternoon to see the girls. Olivia Gordon called here for kerosene oil to anoint little Hector Sutherland. Our servant girl went to the Saltsprings Church, for the looks of it.
2386 2018-12-27 19:49:00 Does wild growth oil help? I’ve seen it and seen amazing results
2387 2018-12-27 19:48:42 It wasn't, ship this much volume -> get X discount. It was, Rockefeller is the master so we tell him where competitors are shipping oil
2388 2018-12-27 19:48:38 When it’s cold the oil in your engine starts to thicken. If you let your car sit for a minute the oil heats and loosens up which is a better lube for your engine. That’s what the temp gauge is for on most older cars

2390 2018-12-27 19:48:28 My brother truer words have never been spoken. If we had the blessings of other countries? We have more than they do. What is it they have that we do not? Is it oil, iron, minerals, precious metals, water, forests, fertile land? We have it all what are we doing with it?
2391 2018-12-27 19:48:27 3 hours for a damn oil change. I’m tired of Chevrolet
2392 2018-12-27 19:48:20 Good !!! I welcome that hypothetical period we men will not have to lift anything , listen to you ( women ) , go get your tampons , go  shopping with you , change the oil in your car , pay the dinner bill , or listen to your gossip/BS
2393 2018-12-27 19:48:09 I suffer from anxiety as well. I’ve been taking CBD oil for a few weeks now ands it’s really made a difference. Give it a shot!
2394 2018-12-27 19:48:08 Meanwhile 
The New Zealand government will grant no new offshore oil exploration permits in a move that is being hailed by conservation and environmental groups as a historic victory in the battle against climate change
2395 2018-12-27 19:48:03 After chemist Roger Adams first extracted CBD in the 1940s, research continued well into the 1960s. That's when tests were completed on primates and researchers were able to produce the first CBD oil intended for therapeutic use. British Pharmacopoeia was the first to release it
2396 2018-12-27 19:47:59 Oil was running outin 2014 remember, but hey al of a sudden there seems to be enough for 50 years to come. And thats without the west coast fields.
2397 2018-12-27 19:47:55 @BillNye can you turn food waste into some kind of usable oil to maybe lessen the amount ?
2398 2018-12-27 19:47:42 Y’all should have gotten oil changes for Christmas, not AirPods.

2400 2018-12-27 19:47:40 Also, using some peppermint oil, not much will help too.  Sorry for the long post.  I also ran a chiropractic office for several years so digestion is my game. 
2401 2018-12-27 19:47:38 Don't pls
2402 2018-12-27 19:47:29 You girls will practically dip yourself in oil, spray yourself with glitter then post a pick saying “ natural glow”
2403 2018-12-27 19:47:14 Rally oil and we close green...leaders materials and energy
2404 2018-12-27 19:47:12 Chef Ramses cut up some worms, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a fine cut of beef, along with sushi.
2405 2018-12-27 19:47:01 My dad calls CBD oil CD oil...there’s 3 letters Greg come on.
2406 2018-12-27 19:46:56 I've used coconut oil before (when I was growing, shhhhhhh) and beezwax to make some goodies.  I like this cause it's sweet but doesn't fuck with my A1c - I can throw 2-3 tablespoons in OJ in the am and be good to go - no high - just balanced.  and it's #WHOLEPLANT - we need all
2407 2018-12-27 19:46:42 Get some coconut oil and make weed butter.
2408 2018-12-27 19:46:39 Apparently life is cheap in oil and gas country. Who cares if a dollar profit costs a few lives! As long a there are no consequences paid for their pollution, who cares?
2409 2018-12-27 19:46:34 เรื่องเอาตัวเองไปเปรียบกะคนอื่นปีนี้ลดลงไปได้เยอะเลย คาดหวังกับตัวเองก็เริ่มจะลดๆ ไปละ มีว้าวุ่นบ้างเเต่เเป๊บๆหาย สรุปปีหน้าคือไม่เหลือไรเลยเพราะลดหายโหม๊ดดด 55555555

2412 2018-12-27 19:46:06 Was discussed on a BBC programme where there were 5 participants from different walks of life.Why would they all hv agreed if it was not primary concern of Qatar at beginning of Syria conflict? Oil expert Daniel Yergin opined gas will become critical for Saudi's own expansion.
2413 2018-12-27 19:46:05 Take me on a shopping spree to the hair store and I’m grabbing ALL the JBCO, Wild Growth oil, Ebin edge control, and every deep conditioner I can find. Lmao. Fucking love the hair store 
2414 2018-12-27 19:45:58 Oil production is on a decline. 

Discuss.
2415 2018-12-27 19:45:49 i forget to oil cleanse ONCE and now my skin is v angry at me
2416 2018-12-27 19:45:46 At this point I could put oil on my tongue and I wouldn’t care that much
2417 2018-12-27 19:45:39 From the weird dream factory last night: I dreamt I was at comedian Dennis Miller's spartan apartment in San Francisco, like we were old friends. Then, I was paying for him to get an oil change. It got late and he had to get to Fox News for an appearance
2418 2018-12-27 19:45:36 And Canada Pavilion is running low on maple syrup. So I hope you like cod liver oil on your pancakes.
2419 2018-12-27 19:45:34 Maximized automation in labour and no further capital development is VERY cost effective for the oil barons.

All else is mere collateral damage.

2421 2018-12-27 19:45:29 the bio oil i only use at night.^
2422 2018-12-27 19:45:25 You are absolutely right. The corporations must stop using plastic its not about we pay money for bags. Stop immediately and start using, providing alternatives. Same with Palm oil.
2423 2018-12-27 19:45:24 sis i lelaki hihi tapi simple cleansing oil tu i ada beli gak, pakai then naik jerawat breaks out kt bahagian jawline, check ingredients tgok ada isopropyl palmitate which is tahap comedogenic is 4. Huhu my face oily+acne prone skin.

2425 2018-12-27 19:45:16 very little can be done about change of climate, and no single model is able to predict outcomes.

green industry however is no different to the oil industry - profit
2426 2018-12-27 19:45:05 I’m making my own CBD oil for a topical cream consisting of CBD and essential oils that I make for my rheumatoid arthritis.  I’ll try vegetable lecithin for my next batch.
2427 2018-12-27 19:44:56 Quenching in water or even oil has long been known to harden steels. Folding & forge welding an ingot of steel added toughness & the resilience to flex, the Damascus steal way to make a sword though many other places like Japan mastered it. Cryo forming does that without folding.
2428 2018-12-27 19:44:54 the best part of tincture is that its literally olive oil
2429 2018-12-27 19:44:52 You can get a salad at McDonalds. Chicken is not that expensive, don't fry it. Oil and vinegar is all you need on a salad. NOT CREAM. All you can eat does not mean eat it all.

your skin can lead to an excess of oil production to compensate the lack of hydration, this means you may end up with another breakout
2433 2018-12-27 19:44:28 Venezuela’s main natural resource, oil, is priced by competitors OPEC and the US. Then they made a mistake of pegging their currency to the Dollar. Not to mention good old fashioned corruption. Capitalism isn’t going to fix those problems for them.
2434 2018-12-27 19:44:28 Kaneh Bosm ... means Fragrant or Aromatic kaneh (hemp).... it was used in the Holy Annointing Oil made by Moses in Exodus 30:23 .... you need to read Hebrew in the original Torah

2442 2018-12-27 19:43:18 One of the things that keeps me pushing is the hope that I can one day live in a car free zone. How much nicer a world to not have to breath car exhaust or step in oil laden puddles!
2443 2018-12-27 19:43:04 U.S. oil books 3.5% loss as crude gives up chunk of Wednesday's risk-on rally
2444 2018-12-27 19:42:57 it's all about the Genie oil pipeline. see many dont realize that Israel's only exports are tech and defense training w/minimal pharma exports & all others are on BDS list cuz from Palestine so they found oil in sea off Gaza and started building pipeline & Syria is needed 4 sales
2445 2018-12-27 19:42:57 Macron tried to sell out the middleclass in France to pay for a tax cut for the wealthy. Beto is in the pocket of oil tycoons and bankers. Youth without integrity means nothing.
2446 2018-12-27 19:42:54 He's probably more pissed over the trillions a gallons of oil that has been leaking in his habitat for the last ten years, compared to that this is a mercy killing. That being said who has the desire to nibble off a live fish, the elite must be stopped.
2447 2018-12-27 19:42:51 About 23 billion less than we send to Canada, or a little more than $20K/family. Ah and the ol'oil subsidy trope...I did overestimate your intelligence, if you were more than just an NPC you'd know that there's no actual data to back that claim. It was made up arbitrarily.
2448 2018-12-27 19:42:38 Name a socialist country that works !  Eg Venezuela   ?   Check the inflation rate,   More oil than most yet the worlds current basket case !

2450 2018-12-27 19:42:06 MIG light rust effects. It’s oil based so it does need time to dry, overnight, but it’s light enough to let you have enough versatility for any application.
2451 2018-12-27 19:42:05 There already is no money or oil under socialism
2452 2018-12-27 19:41:59 And meanwhile Quebec politicians prefer to buy or oil from these people instead of the province that has given them $200 billion since 1961.
2453 2018-12-27 19:41:57 I have finished episode 9 but have to get an oil change before I can watch the finale. Needless to say, I was screaming. Someone hold me.
2454 2018-12-27 19:41:53 Who wanna pay for my oil change ?
2455 2018-12-27 19:41:46 Tried a “sushi bowl” today. It was okay but they put too much raw salmon in it for my taste it should’ve been more veggie laden than they had it. Plus they literally smothered the poor thing in some oil that really killed the taste of the salmon and other stuff.
2456 2018-12-27 19:41:43 Haha!Right!? There is a woman in Main that makes jewelry out of moose poop though!  I only know this because my Mom said she was going to get my sister and I moose crap jewelry for Christmas!!  Thankfully I got an oil defuser & a cast iron skillet instead! 
2457 2018-12-27 19:41:32 What a circus. City and PSG have destroyed the market with their oil and blood money.

use an alcohol free cleanser to remove sweat, dirt + excess oil that you generate daily on your skin, do it regularly but no more than twice a day as, otherwise, it might make your acne worse.

2464 2018-12-27 19:41:06 A bit of mineral oil in your food, maybe? Might help to soften you up a little. Hope you get your doo doo out soon.
2465 2018-12-27 19:41:04 Once again, stocks/oil moving in lockstep
2466 2018-12-27 19:41:01 I usually find a coupon lol pero why not just buy the oil myself and change it for the low 
2467 2018-12-27 19:40:42 53% is not enough. Not a single drop of unrefined oil should be consumed in this country that is not produced in this country. In fact as Canadians we should be trying to shut down the Saudi Arabia is and the Nigeria's rather than fighting ourselves
2468 2018-12-27 19:40:41 Baby oil is so fire.
2469 2018-12-27 19:40:36 Hmm sounds  to me like you only support unions. What about the oil patch,long haul truckers, snow plow drivers, clerks in store etc etc., I’ll bet they are getting buckets of money in Overtime nor big fat pensions #albertastrong #albertaproud #Albrexit #albertaseparation
2470 2018-12-27 19:40:33 Have yet to see solar or wind replace a single carbon source. Something else will come along but in the meantime oil is what we got. Want to help? Then I better see you walk EVERYWHERE, , NEVER EAT MEAT and that clothing on your back better be made of of the leaves you rake.
2471 2018-12-27 19:40:27 Oil market closed, 2401 likely to hold up today, $spx
2472 2018-12-27 19:40:25 This is too long. Many of us have already lost our minds.  All I can say is thank  god for Adam McKay. Everything you thought you knew about Cheney is true. Plame, selling oil fields in Iraq, Blaming Iraq for 9/11.  ISIS grew out of rubble of Iraq.  Go see @vicemovie.  Woo hoo
2473 2018-12-27 19:40:09 Funny how the US is buying around 1000000 bbl/ day of our bituminous oil
2474 2018-12-27 19:40:07 知ってる？スーパーってタダで牛脂くれるんだよ。
2475 2018-12-27 19:40:06 Nope-it is about market access and the Feds (Quebec)plundering Alberta’s resources-the hypocrisy is astounding-use the $80 mill lost per day to transition, pay down debt or else stop importing oil
2476 2018-12-27 19:40:04 I hate having to pay for oil changes and tires and alignments and all that extra shit
2477 2018-12-27 19:39:57 I’ve been using CBD oil for a couple months now with positive effects on my sleep.. just the suspension drops.. not sure about the capsules yet..
2478 2018-12-27 19:39:48 I don't expect anything. I was a mother of 3 small boys who stayed home while my husband hauled oil & chemicals for #oilandgas industry.  

I have also been a single mother & main breadwinner in a male dominated profession #peaceofficer.

2479 2018-12-27 19:39:46 Jojoba oil is *chefs kiss*
2480 2018-12-27 19:39:41 Autistic people do not blame vaccines for our autism. Nor should the parents. It keeps their kids from getting the right services when they look at bogus reasons. If you blame autism on vaccines your setting your kids up for abuse by snake oil
2481 2018-12-27 19:39:33 @JarrettGC  corn is rich in B12, corn oil increases blood flow, lowers cholesteroal absorption and regulates insulin
2482 2018-12-27 19:39:29 I'm sure he owns all the Crude oil in Nigeria 
2483 2018-12-27 19:39:28 Also great for your skin and fighting free radicals(carcinogens). I always eat organic cannabis butter and supplement with black seed oil!
2484 2018-12-27 19:39:27 Yeah you need it
2485 2018-12-27 19:39:25 I really loved seeing all that. Your presence on stage is so great, you really let loose and give it your all! It was also nice seeing the less exciting parts, like browsing for olive oil  thanks for sharing all that with us!
2486 2018-12-27 19:39:17 I want this tweet framed. The essential oil is grease 
2487 2018-12-27 19:39:05 Yes but paalak reduce in oil and methi seed and fry b4 introducing in moong,.. for moong just salt haldi chillie flakes and one tomato and garlic
2488 2018-12-27 19:38:49 Thank you! He finally stopped tossing and turning at around 4am and he's sleeping still. He's a trooper, poor puppy. I'm going to go to the vet and pick up more pain stuff for him and ordered a more robust CBD oil so hopefully that will help.
2489 2018-12-27 19:38:44 Get a humidifier or an oil diffuser!
2490 2018-12-27 19:38:43 Well no sleep just yet I have another recovery up by Sheep's Bridge be another long adventure. 
Going to do that tomorrow but there's things I have to get done on the truck before I go out again like getting oil change, the transmission service, replacing a shock
2491 2018-12-27 19:38:41 i like that injectable testosterone is suspended in what is essentially cooking oil. every time i do my shot i imagine making a tasty little gender stir fry
2492 2018-12-27 19:38:26 I’m getting an oil change & this is the first time I’ve seen more thab half of the mechanics being women.  @jiffylube
2493 2018-12-27 19:38:18 It’s healthier. There’s no need to add oil, except for a little on French Fries. Lol Also it’s keeps the oil/drippings off of fatty foods unlike baking them.
2494 2018-12-27 19:38:14 with over 800 billion dollars in direct tax breaks or subsides to Energy industry since 2000 FUK THAT maybe when the subsides End ! Link your Royalties to Jobs Automation is killing Oil patch Jobs TOO
2495 2018-12-27 19:38:06 I need to go get a oil change. Wow this is not a woman’s job Where’s my daddy
2496 2018-12-27 19:38:05 Does anyone have recommendations for reasonably priced CBD oil tinctures? online or in Portland
2497 2018-12-27 19:37:52 Bread + oil
2498 2018-12-27 19:37:50 grain than you'll know what to do with. Bread will be coming right out of your ears, ma'am. New roads. Agriculture. Employment, education. These are just a few of the things we can offer you, and I assure you ladies and gentlemen, that if we do find oil here, and I think there's
2499 2018-12-27 19:37:49 @Rosie   So glad you’re in your happy place.  I think Felicity is giving me her bronchitis.   I am guzzling Sambucal #elderberryextract. Will keep me well. That and black seed oil and Astrugalus.
2500 2018-12-27 19:37:41 It's not like PE/CAPE values have changed very much. But the stock market is trolling the FED and future growth estimates for sure. Only oil is a decent causality reason for increased/continued growth, and only if the FED cut rates.
2501 2018-12-27 19:37:36 Goodyear said they couldn’t conduct an oil change on my car cause I have a power steering leak man foh
2502 2018-12-27 19:37:32 when was the last time you cleaned/replaced your air filter and checked your oil?
2503 2018-12-27 19:37:21 Russia is just a Oil Nerd sidekick to China.

Russia never trusts China.

Now the battle is just between US and China, and Russia is just an valuable asset.

China wants to drag Russia into muck.

US wants Russia at best to stay as neutral.

Russia has its own plans.

2504 2018-12-27 19:37:18 cannabis oil has been around for years
2505 2018-12-27 19:37:13 En wie investeerd er eigenlijk. 

Big oil.

2507 2018-12-27 19:37:11 Bread + palm oil
2508 2018-12-27 19:37:08 sorry but when did oil changes become $86 didn’t they used to literally be $25 or is that just me
2509 2018-12-27 19:37:06 I wash my face with Cetaphil, use the soap & let it sit while I brush my teeth, rinse it off, witch hazel toner, bio oil, Cetaphil moisturizer then rose water spray. I got a whole damn routine, morning & night 
2510 2018-12-27 19:37:02 You know what doesn't get enough praise: olive oil
2511 2018-12-27 19:36:45 Yup, metal. But I needed to oil it first or this particular vegan batter is too flax-sticky because it broke apart when I tried to remove and flip.
2512 2018-12-27 19:36:34 then I re-seasoned with corn oil that I only use for seasoning, so it's about 2 years old and didn't look even.  Today, I scrubbed with steel wool for a do-over and used crisco which is in the fridge, so well see - lol
2513 2018-12-27 19:36:31 Thimerosal (ethylmercury, NOT elemental mercury) hasn't been in childhood vac for 20 years. There has NEVER been peanut oil. Someone 50 years ago TESTED it as A POTENTIAL ingredient. It was never included. If you work with kids you need to be more careful of your info sources.
2514 2018-12-27 19:36:28 Really?? I don’t use it as much anymore but I love it. But anything oil free should be a good cleanser
2515 2018-12-27 19:36:22 なんだか楽しくなってきたし足冷たいしで睡眠時間がもうめちゃくちゃ
2516 2018-12-27 19:36:20 Just got my oil changed and tires rotated all good to go

And damn Nick is cute

2518 2018-12-27 19:36:07 I do safflower oil for both my beard and my dreads
2519 2018-12-27 19:36:06 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
2520 2018-12-27 19:36:05 Oil change and new tires
2521 2018-12-27 19:35:55 Our God is amazing. If the daughter is married to a multi-billionaire and an oil mogul, everything is doable
2522 2018-12-27 19:35:54 Oh of course. The Leave in and Coconut oil are mine.. AND ima hide her bonnet
2523 2018-12-27 19:35:40 Who can justify the US spending trillions in the Mideast, an amount approaching the present value of its known reserves, when we have plenty of oil here?  China is building infrastructure and making oil deals in Ecuador while the US subsidizes global dependence on fossil fuels.
2524 2018-12-27 19:35:31 Damn my oil cartridge just ran out and I have to face reality again lol 
2525 2018-12-27 19:35:27 Dry patch where Alfie’s Rover P6 was parked but with tell tail oil patches from the car  ... love the accuracy  ...  #Eastenders
2526 2018-12-27 19:35:19 They said the accretion in FX reserve is due to higher oil prices and no effort of @MBuhari but they blame him for the recession caused by this same oil prices. They blame him for the increase in fuel prices and now they say he should remove subsidy (under-recovery). What is it?
2527 2018-12-27 19:35:07 Onc ed again you are too  old you are not keeping up with current news- fo you know how many millionaires were created in 2018 . Here's a hint 700000. Take your socialist snake oil and peddle it elsewhere.
2528 2018-12-27 19:35:04 Cooking tip: when you’re frying chicken cut a whole bulb of garlic in half and throw it in the oil with the chicken  #BoneAppleTea

2533 2018-12-27 19:34:26 Corporation is the cancer in our society. We need to cut it out before it spread even further. BOYCOTT them. Cancel Netflix, cancel facebook, boycott oil corporations, boycott healthcare that is causing homelessness, boycott legislations that hurt ppl but help the Corp.
2534 2018-12-27 19:34:22 Crazy that Oil is moving in 4%+ swings on a daily basis. $USO
2535 2018-12-27 19:34:16 Oil dey Una head aswear 
2536 2018-12-27 19:34:15 What type of soap do you use?  and does tea tree oil help just in case you get an infection?
2537 2018-12-27 19:34:12 What was surprising was gas was much more expensive right in the area where they were pumping OIL in the permean basin around the big bend.. Austin price is still 1.90 .. In the basin it was 2.45 !
2538 2018-12-27 19:34:07 So Saudi with a higher GDP-ppp, renowned for its opulence has had its oil stolen

Or sold at market rates and made them incredibly rich
2539 2018-12-27 19:34:00 cod lover oil

2542 2018-12-27 19:33:34 Oil is gonna have to get an upward trend and dollar needs to go down a bit. Plus wall street low vol this week.

2546 2018-12-27 19:33:26 Pep Boys be taking forever to do a damn oil change
2547 2018-12-27 19:33:08 24 years in the US Navy and I've come to realize my whole career has been based on destabilizing countries for oil and money. Has destabilizing the Middle East and Africa made my life better in the US? No. Somebody needs to start pointing the finger at the problem in the world.
2548 2018-12-27 19:33:07 At some point @TheJusticeDept needs to look at this company which behaves as badly as Standard Oil did. Consistent price increases, very nominal upgrades and CONSISTENT bugs. #FixThis #60amonthRipOff

2551 2018-12-27 19:32:36 Not only has Josh not shown Sirota's argument about oil company donations to beto to be dishonest, his premise is nonsensical. Dishonest statements do not undermine honest true ones, they just make them easier for people like him to try to wrongly undermine them, and he hasnt
2552 2018-12-27 19:32:33 Same bro, thorough warm ups and cod liver oil capsules
2553 2018-12-27 19:32:31 He’s right - Cowherd is a pompous, idiotic blowhard. Talk about lighting blue tips while skipping though a fracking oil well field.... if he made sense, no one would pay attention. He’s the Anne Coulter of sports talk
2554 2018-12-27 19:32:24 See the way Justin thinks is like Quebec. They claim a surplus in Quebec, others are running deficits. But Quebec gets 13 billion so it's all good. 
He uses Alberta money to basically own the vote in Quebec while wiping out the oil jobs and now he uses Alberta's money to buy them
2555 2018-12-27 19:32:24 He hums happily. Their table is located at a corne, and a waiter asks for their order.

“Trust me on this one”, he says 

He asked for gnocchi with carbonara (cream-based with pancetta) and a dish of margherita pasta (tomato and basil) with olive oil.

“You’ll love it”, he smiles
2556 2018-12-27 19:32:20 The oil we steal you really are delusional Saudi UAE yes we really steal You’re as mad as a box of frogs
2557 2018-12-27 19:32:09 Then get real and cut out the breaks and subsidies for oil and gas
2558 2018-12-27 19:32:05 Really, if mercury is poisonous per the EPA then why is it ok in vaccines? If using peanut oil in vaccines caused peanut allergies why is that okay?
2559 2018-12-27 19:31:37 Unemployment is at a 40 year low. Trudeau has given an opportunity to diversify away from oil dependence. While Scheer may promote oil at the fuel for the next 100 years it is not. Harper's attempt to make Canada grossly oil dependent has been a huge disaster.
2560 2018-12-27 19:31:34 I’d say your oil wasn’t pure.
2561 2018-12-27 19:31:29 My holiday meal included water chestnuts, red peppers cool and hot, garlic, onions,sesame oil, jasmine rice, low sodium soy sauce and chicken. I forget something. 2018 cooking as therapy.
2562 2018-12-27 19:31:22 Someone come do a hot oil treatment on my hair please I feel tired
2563 2018-12-27 19:30:56 Used this company for the first time today and we will definitely be customers. Tom delivered our fuel today and he was just great. 

Thank you Reitz Oil.
2564 2018-12-27 19:30:55 You should do a golden oldies thread. I for one am sick and tired of the whining about how PMJT is doing nothing for AB. I would love for someone to tell us what Harper did for AB other than punish the oil industry after attacking income trusts when they promised not to.
2565 2018-12-27 19:30:48 @twila_oil
2566 2018-12-27 19:30:47 So building new pipelines and investing in oil is the solution to those problems? 
2567 2018-12-27 19:30:46 Mix 11 lbs English muffins with 3 cups Cabbage. Mix into  Olive Oil. Cut with butter. Serve with chili
2568 2018-12-27 19:30:39 Is she still alive? We’re talking about oil carts btw
2569 2018-12-27 19:30:39 I pay more for some items, but you happened to be part of the government that was in power at the time. I blame you personally for why I pay more. I blame you for why Alberta Oil isn’t to a coastline. Take responsibility for what you did. Not pass the blame onto others.

2573 2018-12-27 19:29:51 Does it mean "cannabis oil" in Hebrew?
2574 2018-12-27 19:29:46 I generally just try to play the game I know (bank stocks), and don't trade oil, but up 10% yesterday, down 6% today in the worlds largest energy source is messed up.

Is that a healthy thing for market structure? Asking for a friend.
2575 2018-12-27 19:29:40 NO LIE! That's my mom's old school Dominican hair treatment!! Mayonnaise, mashed avocado (the big ones, not the ones they use in Guacamole) and olive oil. Mix all that up and put in your hair and sit under a hair dryer for 30 minutes, then a ROLOS set and TUBI hair wrap.
2576 2018-12-27 19:29:36 girl Ive been using it for years. it doesnt work for me & you buy it  leave me and my tea tree oil alone
2577 2018-12-27 19:29:34 Just a note: in the 1940’s, a tonka driver was overheard telling his horse,”Go forward, like Hitler.” India hoped the Germans’ colonial war in Europe would end England’s colonial rule in India. & it did. WWII was the Northern Hemisphere losing its tiny mind, ultimately, over oil.
2578 2018-12-27 19:29:34 وش القرار اللي خسر فلوسك ؟
2579 2018-12-27 19:29:24 oil en soporte, a ver si aguanta.
2580 2018-12-27 19:29:09 Oh, for crissake, individual contributions made through Act Blue from people who work in a state where oil is big business. Joe in IT & Marge in accounting can't contribute to the candidate of their choice?
2581 2018-12-27 19:29:05 I mean if you want a high volume one. Realistically you don’t even need one unless you’re running boost. 5.3’s don’t turn over enough RPM to worry about oil starvation. Maybe if you get a 6.0 block and put a 4.8 rotating assembly in and go N/A
2582 2018-12-27 19:28:57 Our civilisation is based on a resource which is definitely finite. Oil and petrochemicals lubricate the wheels of industry, and war, the most profitable business in the world.
2583 2018-12-27 19:28:54 My parents took my car to get a oil change and stuff so there’s really no need for me to move at all today
2584 2018-12-27 19:28:47 Jason Kenny blames him for Job Loses in the OIL patch WTF Let him take some credit for gains... Harper royally FUKD the pipelines with his changes energy board!
2585 2018-12-27 19:28:45 I got more coconut oil for Christmas I’m so thankful!! 
2586 2018-12-27 19:28:40 In the last 24 hrs there were a total of 8 oil product tankers in the ports of Quebec City and Montreal. Yet according to Quebec Premier François Legault, there is no social acceptability for oil in Quebec.

2587 2018-12-27 19:28:38 Win? What exactly have we won during OEF in the last 18 years besides oil, a steady supply of opium into the country and a way to keep money filling your pockets? I guess that is winning in your books. I don't think the families of 4,500+ lives lost feel like we won anything..
2588 2018-12-27 19:28:36 this is on you @RachelNotley for pushing fossil fuels and @JustinTrudeau and @SohiAmarjeet for investing 1.6 billion in oil and gas in Alberta. You are going to destroy us and this planet.
2589 2018-12-27 19:28:31 wilko has a nail polish brand that do nail oil and stuff for REAL CHEAP so if yr nails are feelin the punishment of peeling varnish off all the time give them a lil dab of nail/cuticle oil and rub it in maybe at night so it has time to absorb and they might feel a lil better x

2593 2018-12-27 19:27:53 I know, right? Modern society doesn't need whale oil anymore, and Japan has plenty of food. Hunting whales is completely pointless, AND a threat to endangered species.
2594 2018-12-27 19:27:42 Last time I got my oil changed the guy was like “so it looks like you’re gonna need a new cabin filter” that’ll be an additional $110. Naw bruh, keep it, I’ll handle that another day
2595 2018-12-27 19:27:42 For your face? I’ve been using Origins moisturize but when I when I ran out, o started using a face oil. Regular Almond oil or Ole Henriksen youth oil.
2596 2018-12-27 19:27:38 meh... interest rates and oil.

2597 2018-12-27 19:27:37 What about tar sands development and big oil, which is the biggest welfare recipients in the country?
2598 2018-12-27 19:27:31 Got my oil changed and my car is driving so much better
2599 2018-12-27 19:27:30 #ThursdayThoughts "Language hackers" are snake oil salesmen. My path for Russian includes @Michel_Thomas method, then @Pimsleur, plus 20 minutes a day on a flash card app like @language_drops, then getting to 100 hours+ of movies, magazines, conversation, etc #ThursdayMotivation
2600 2018-12-27 19:27:24 hi binch. the point is that beto does NOT have the same goals as progressives. Progressives want an end to an oil based economy and Beto takes a shitload of oil money. that’s the fuckballin point
2601 2018-12-27 19:27:24 cash register further in my office.... Chop Suey niggah wtf you doing over there, stop helping pewm press the green button on the fry grill, idc how many times he let the oil get cold by pressing the red button, get tf over here goddamn you.... Sheesh!!
2602 2018-12-27 19:27:22 FYI. It’s not always inevitable. A gf and her husband sold their oil supply co for just under 2 digit millions. They looked into offshore but made a conscious decision not to use it. They remember working hard for little for many years. Actually surprised me. 
2603 2018-12-27 19:27:16 wish somebody would drop my car off to get an oil change  ion feel like moving
2604 2018-12-27 19:27:15 Everybody wants a car, but y’all don’t know having a car comes with so much. 
~Gas 
~Tires 
~Oil changes 
~If something breaks/ Car accidents
~Car washes
2605 2018-12-27 19:27:08 You can use oregano oil as natural Antibiotica, but it has not the high potence as you get from a medication from your doctor. So i would take it after my medication ends. Then it worked for me very well and get quicker healthy then in the past.
2606 2018-12-27 19:27:03 The snake oil salesman on his incessant loop of lie after lie after lie.
2607 2018-12-27 19:26:48 Choosing to follow you may have been the best decision I made in 2018. What essential oil do you use to be able to be such an ass?
2608 2018-12-27 19:26:47 Yet he got rich without taking money and selling his votes to big oil big pharma and defense contractors (offensive) wars can you say that about @CoryBooker @SpeakerRyan @NancyPelosi
2609 2018-12-27 19:26:47 I believe these are the same folks who believe Justin Trudeau is destroying the oil and gas industry.
2610 2018-12-27 19:26:43 #oil #will #gap #lower #tonight #OOTT
2611 2018-12-27 19:26:42 Isn’t it always about selling weapons and oil?
2612 2018-12-27 19:26:40 Norway, for example, answered the "who will pay for it?" question by putting $1 trillion dollars of offshore oil drilling money into the account for social programs on top of high taxes. We need to look at the whole complex system when thinking of adopting parts of it.
2613 2018-12-27 19:26:39 We are looking into it for our elderly Lab.

It does not have THC so she won’t get stoned. It can help with anxiety and pain.

Pet stores should have CBD treats. Or you can get oil from a dispensary.

It’s very expensive though. $25 for a bag of treats or $70 an ounce for liquid
2614 2018-12-27 19:26:36 My December with @Levis_UK 

Order 1 : Arrives covered in oil.  Appreciate this is not their fault but the response is baffling.

2) Order 'lost in system' - still been charged and no refund.

3) No update since order, suspect it's lost again and I've been charged again.

Brill.
2615 2018-12-27 19:26:34 Now playing: SOPHIE - 'Ponyboy' from 'Oil of Every Pearl's Un-Insides'
2616 2018-12-27 19:26:29 Oh you want me to sell you snake oil?
2617 2018-12-27 19:26:28 Garri + Yaji (dried pepper) + ground nut oil
2618 2018-12-27 19:26:28 Unless you have a table of the *current* oil change intervals for all cars, it's the safe option. Don't want to have to pay for a customer's new timing chain.

That, and more income for them
2619 2018-12-27 19:26:17 Blackwater dumbass. And if you haven't noticed government just does what the corporations want. Like invade the middle East for oil.
2620 2018-12-27 19:26:14 Looking for recommendations for organic #CBD oil.... Anyone?
2621 2018-12-27 19:26:13 Candide in North Dakota oil boom country.
2622 2018-12-27 19:25:57 lol I believe that's the essential oil Co but others also thought it was the name 
2623 2018-12-27 19:25:54 in need of more body oil
2624 2018-12-27 19:25:43 Да заняты всем - кроме хоккея. 
2625 2018-12-27 19:25:39 Yup, definitely no sexy oil wrestling involved here. XD
2626 2018-12-27 19:25:21 Nope. @TurfEnto got it right. The American Oil Beetle - a blister Beetle.
2627 2018-12-27 19:25:10 Every day I'm disappointed with cross river people on how they gather to watch Donald Duke and his crew during bikers carnival. Man did nothing for them during oil boom.  Cross River is a mess.
2628 2018-12-27 19:25:05 If you decide to cook, make sure you use some spices you like (steak seasoning works on almost all meats) and use some olive oil.  These are small tidbits, but dry, unseasoned food is a huge deterrent to cooking for yourself.
2629 2018-12-27 19:25:01 US will never leave Iraq, silly.  Run out of oil and US will think about leaving.  Maybe.
2630 2018-12-27 19:24:56 Always beware of people who follow a leader as opposed to a platform. The biggest problem I have with Beto is that he takes oil money. I don't know if he would vote for the #GreenNewDeal. It's a valid concern for those that want the democratic socialist platform to succeed.
2631 2018-12-27 19:24:53 I have the Presto waffle bowl maker and it is everything you'd hope for.  No need to oil it, nothing sticks and the waffles turn out beautifully.  And it is inexpensive to boot.
2632 2018-12-27 19:24:52 When I was in culinary school one of my pastry teachers punished our class for being unruly by having a day where every recipe we made had durian in it. Custards, cakes, pies... The whole kitchen smelled like trash soaked in oil and left out in the sun 
2633 2018-12-27 19:24:45 if u ever wanna try rosehip oil don’t get theirs get the buff & butter one off eBay you get more for your money ! 100ml is a piss take. I’d recommend it
2634 2018-12-27 19:24:31 30+ oil execs donating $2,700 at a time is not at all the same as a cashier donating $5.
2635 2018-12-27 19:24:29 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
2636 2018-12-27 19:24:29 Pake grapeseed oil yang food grade terus cosrx low pH
2637 2018-12-27 19:24:24 Peppermint essential oil rubbed at the base of your skull.
2638 2018-12-27 19:24:17 I did think the original Sirota tweet about oil and gas money was missing some context (the money was from oil and gas employees and not PACs, that oil and gas are the largest employers in the state, and the overall amount was a very small percentage of his total amount raised)
2639 2018-12-27 19:24:10 EPIC grape juice olive oil victorias secret perfume i love live in bed?
2640 2018-12-27 19:24:05 I can never be great and just get my oil changed
2641 2018-12-27 19:24:03 Oil Of "The Essential 'Essences of Essential Oil' Essentialism"
2642 2018-12-27 19:24:02 Desi ppl ADD MORE oil to their salans sometimes for the look of the dish and if thats not one of the many reasons behind their health problems then idk what is
2643 2018-12-27 19:24:01 I figured it would be because it was so grainy. Maybe if I add oil to certain recipes to coat the grains? Idk
2644 2018-12-27 19:23:57 Actually, snake oil salesmen is pretty racist. I didn't  correlate the two for years, but snake oil was a traditional Chinese medicine. The meaning was buried.
2645 2018-12-27 19:23:35 Get yo oil change dawg
2646 2018-12-27 19:23:33  I see Miguel be hiting the g pipe I mean oil burners  from his job

2648 2018-12-27 19:23:25 Oil air pocket into the pit close
2649 2018-12-27 19:23:23 Also the criticisms of Beto weren’t limited to his donations from oil executives. It extended to his actual votes that aligned with the pockets of those executives at the expense of democratic coalitions and the environment
2650 2018-12-27 19:23:15 If Maise had even basic common sense she would be fretting for the future of her children in a Trumpian Shithole Nation of oil, plastics,toxic chemicals, concrete & beautiful coal.
2651 2018-12-27 19:23:14 We use a lot of hydropower in Norway yes, but oil and gas constitutes one of our main exports and electricity are bought and sold beteeen european countries independent of source... uncertain of where that leaves us... 
2652 2018-12-27 19:23:10 6 eggs, 2 cups of flour and sugar, 1.5 cups of oil, 2 tsps of baking powder

Sieve the all purpose flour+ baking powder together x3
Beat sugar + oil 
break in eggs one by one whilst beating on full
Add vanilla essence
add the flour and mix using a spatula
Bake.

FOOL PROOF RECIPE
2653 2018-12-27 19:23:10 and that oil pump and she set
2654 2018-12-27 19:22:36 it's funny how obsessed people are with the utility value of things like gold ... def a liability from a monetary quality perspective ... same could be said of oil
2655 2018-12-27 19:22:34 BITXH WHAT THE FUCK, HOW DI YOU EVEN MISTAKE AN OIL FOR A GEL- I
2656 2018-12-27 19:22:33 wtf - dude we are literally selling snake oil again
2657 2018-12-27 19:22:33 Shoud've done the 'ol oil change there Dex
2658 2018-12-27 19:22:04 #AAOG can’t believe paying 12/13p months back on the hope of oil.and hit oil in 2 layers and sat at 10p ????? the bent corrupt market of aim...what a load of bollocks, should be well into 15-20p region. not surprised people don’t want to invest into this corrupt aim shit anymore.
2659 2018-12-27 19:21:59 Shut your mouth. might have some credibility once you give up oil &gas products.  that’s not gonna happen anytime soon, you can’t live without them. Its OK to buy sorry oil from a country where it ok to beat your wife #albertaproud #albertastrong #albertaseparation #Albrexit
2660 2018-12-27 19:21:44 folks tolerate all types of destructive office behaviors but the moment you use some lacroix in your essential oil defuser everyone loses their shit
2661 2018-12-27 19:21:38 I have a coopland, but Bitzer has developed a valve to pull the oil to the compressor automatically. We're testing.
2662 2018-12-27 19:21:30 Tea tree oil
2663 2018-12-27 19:21:25 So war isn't merely oil and regime change.. add gold in bunkers & alien devices..
2664 2018-12-27 19:21:24 Got a new massage oil, can’t wait to use it 
2665 2018-12-27 19:21:14 Luckily, the lithium doesn't impact the environment nearly as much as digging for oil and gas. And new battery tech is being researched by Dyson for a solid state battery, that replaces lithium with ceramics and can potentially hold more charge. +
2666 2018-12-27 19:21:12 i want an essential oil diffuser
2667 2018-12-27 19:21:07 That's definitely some oil of ulay q10 shit right there.
2668 2018-12-27 19:21:07 That's odd??!
Given the way things are for oil prices and production globally it doesn't looks as the provincial government has anything to do with it though
2669 2018-12-27 19:21:01 Love my CBD oil, really helps with anxiety
2670 2018-12-27 19:20:58 I THOUGHT SHARJEEL MEMON WAS THE ONLY ONE ALLOWED SPIRITS WHICH TURN INTO HONEY AND OLIVE OIL
2671 2018-12-27 19:20:56 Yesss! I have some bottles and like roller pad things if you want a few to mix your own to keep in! Is there a store around here that sells oil
2672 2018-12-27 19:20:49 No he didn’t. He reported one data point - that Beto raised more from oil & gas cos than any other pol - w/o giving any context. That these were employees not Corp donations, that oil & has ranked 12th of all sectors, etc. that’s not journalisms but advocacy
2673 2018-12-27 19:20:44 The blood and the fat sweat and the smell of burnt mid night oil.
2674 2018-12-27 19:20:44 Ok I read somewhere that black seed oil is beneficial to you in general
2675 2018-12-27 19:20:39 Go rub some coconut oil on your lips, then exfoliate them with a pinch of granulated sugar.

Thank me later.
2676 2018-12-27 19:20:29 Mine is too bad finding dark spot solutions are hard cause they can break you out too but I can suggest Shea butter , after I started using that for a while my dark spots cleared and vitamin E oil (but it made me get some bumps) or if you wanna be fancy use @Clinique .
2677 2018-12-27 19:20:23 All the Scottish out in force. What will they do when the oil runs out ? Serious question?
2678 2018-12-27 19:20:19 Maybe we're on borrowed time, there's an impending oil crisis then we're off.
2679 2018-12-27 19:20:17 Or chunks of meat into hot oil. We did this as well.
2680 2018-12-27 19:20:15 So I had 0 oil in my car.. and now that my uncle put some it’s like so smoooth.. 
2681 2018-12-27 19:20:06 olive oil is the purest thing humans have made
2682 2018-12-27 19:19:57 Not change oil in cars
2683 2018-12-27 19:19:43 Sheikh ba oil well is that one Sheikh? Don’t you see the list of all the Bosses he mentioned, and you know better ai. Only me for all those love messages?
2684 2018-12-27 19:19:42 While the grander strategy is to secure Middle Eastern oil and related commerce. We already have a breathtaking number of bases in the region and could intervene as needed without delay. Let the contractors and CIA handle the covert stuff.
2685 2018-12-27 19:19:35 Olive oil is unsaturated and fruit oil , these are couple of the reasons for being one of the healthiest oil  and include powerful antioxidants that makes olive tree to live thousand  of years 
2686 2018-12-27 19:19:27 FUCK OIL PASTEL HONESTLY
2687 2018-12-27 19:19:25 I have contempt for liberals because in power they are the same as the cons. I have contempt for the NDP in AB because they are pushing for expansion of oil production even as the best science says we've got a decade to get off oil before it starts killing us off en mass.
2688 2018-12-27 19:19:24 every time I put syrup on my pancakes it always absorbs too quick ima just use motor oil next time
2689 2018-12-27 19:19:23 so you use the soap then the oil and the moisturizer last ?
2690 2018-12-27 19:19:17 Yes. The point is that as the price of crude fluctuates, either naturally or artificially, the market reallocates resources. It's not a free market on the other side either. Lobbies will push for subsidies to their industries in competition with oil.
2691 2018-12-27 19:19:07 $SPX was way oversold yesterday so it is understandable that $DJIA $DJI rocket up 
There is still a glut of $OIL and US is producing more $WTI than the saudis and russians. 
$SPN $CHK $RIG $AAPL $CAT $BHC
2692 2018-12-27 19:19:01 We hear you. This is a really important issue and we’ve been driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years.  We’re on track to meet our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.

2694 2018-12-27 19:18:54 if this government is so concerned about world pollution...why is it okay with exporting coal to countries with almost no regulations and  importing oil from countries with almost no regulations ? they also have no problems with dumping raw sewage into our waterways
2695 2018-12-27 19:18:54 “Turkish women are made of rose water, olive oil and honey.”
2696 2018-12-27 19:18:45 Amazing! Reminds me of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 oil zone stage
2697 2018-12-27 19:18:45 I used to talk to Tanya's father about her giving money to Hillary.. re: her being an oil heiress.. We would get in roundabout arguments to which I would say "Who is zooming who"? He would argue politicians preying on his daughter for $$ I would argue it was other way around.
2698 2018-12-27 19:18:29 Actually our federal plan is to have transitioned to renewables completely by 2040. Guess we see who doesn't know what they're talking about. Also, oil production hasn't slowed from the pipeline despite falling prices. Twinning it now would be economic suicide.
2699 2018-12-27 19:18:21 Alberta is selling Giant Tiger oil and hoping to charge Dolce & Gabbana prices.

2703 2018-12-27 19:17:58 I think most albertans are looking for anyone who talks about being pro oil...Trudeau hasn’t really done anything to help many people though
2704 2018-12-27 19:17:57 #Alberta is having a legitimately hard time right now. The world is moving past oil, yet they are screaming about how important it is to pipe more oil. Alberta is what #ontario was in the 80’s, what #NFLD deals with for decades. U never heard about separation from us. Snowflakes.
2705 2018-12-27 19:17:56 Oil change  new battery  now just have to clean and organize the house

2713 2018-12-27 19:17:22 why oil make niggas mad ?
2714 2018-12-27 19:17:17 I haven’t tried the oil but the CBD gummies can also work really well for sleeping/relaxation.
2715 2018-12-27 19:17:17 Gallup poll shows Obama most admired 11 yrs in a row!! Proof the country is filled with morons.

2716 2018-12-27 19:17:16 I guess inflation catch that one too....

2719 2018-12-27 19:17:02 Oil 101, allt om olja... typ
2720 2018-12-27 19:16:59 Getting a massage is a lot like mummification (lotion, oil, rubbing, peace, linen), but you have to be alive when it’s over
2721 2018-12-27 19:16:47 Unless Alberta can separate from the rest of the planet, their oil industry protection strategy can take a hike.
2722 2018-12-27 19:16:46 I left religion until I realized God Told Moses to use Cannabis (Cannabis) in the Holy Annointing Oil. Now I’m a big Fan.
2723 2018-12-27 19:16:43 I just eat 3 cloves with a spoonful of olive oil to neutralize the burn from the allicin, cycled with Methylsulfonylmethane. Really, we should be eating garlic daily either way.
2724 2018-12-27 19:16:35 That sounds more like Humanity “Naturally destroying itself.”  What would have been the natural outcome had that situation in Alberta been allowed to mature in, say, 15,000 years? Oil for the next iteration of mankind?
2725 2018-12-27 19:16:26 oh it definitely is... pee probably smell like motor oil and regret
2726 2018-12-27 19:16:10 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.
2727 2018-12-27 19:16:00 Yeah, I can work with garden tomatoes... if you have Parmesan cheese, parsley, olive oil, and breadcrumbs (not from the counter or floor)?
2728 2018-12-27 19:15:56 How you gon come at Phyno? Is there engine oil in your brain?

2730 2018-12-27 19:15:52 home is boring. at the point where i might fuck around and go get an oil change or something idk
2731 2018-12-27 19:15:49 So now we're down to the "real" argument, which is complaining about Québec. Whatever QC does has nothing to do with either AB's deficits (self-inflicted) or AB's access to oil markets, considering that QC refines some 53% of western oil, most of the rest from the US.
2732 2018-12-27 19:15:47 How can the ppt not ramp Oil above $45 into the close? Shameful
2733 2018-12-27 19:15:42 Put a couple suggestions there...  Plumbing, oil change, spider killing, and trash collection.  Now we play the waiting game.
2734 2018-12-27 19:15:36 Then when I go get the oil change I don’t be wanting nothing but the oil change. Don’t be tryna add shit else cuz it’s running fine to me.
2735 2018-12-27 19:15:23 COCONUT OIL (only some will understand the reference)
2736 2018-12-27 19:15:19 Oh I'm just talking about a guy on that course I did recently. He wanted to start a tarot card style business or something like that. He just oozed snake oil salesman vibes. He was creepy.
2737 2018-12-27 19:15:17 any thoughts on index fund re-balance/redemption given the price of crude oil?
2738 2018-12-27 19:15:10 I’ve been using tea tree oil and lemon juice on my face for my hyperpigmentation and BAAAYBEE. #lifehackalert lol
2739 2018-12-27 19:15:06 that's like getting a M5 and tanking it up with cooking oil
2740 2018-12-27 19:15:05 And oil changes fuck them both
2741 2018-12-27 19:14:59 A drop of peppermint essential oil in a shot of water. Voila!
2742 2018-12-27 19:14:56 “Dying industry” ... despite what #EnviroHeroes want to believe, fossil fuel and oil sands is a growing industry and will continue to be for a long time to come
2743 2018-12-27 19:14:48 why do babies need baby oil? whos oiling babies?
2744 2018-12-27 19:14:45 More oil papa
2745 2018-12-27 19:14:38 Koi CBD oil is incredible
2746 2018-12-27 19:14:28 I always thought Canada should refine its own oil, but things are bad in oil generally, and oil sands oil simply is not the most cost effective. Why not diversify? Why always rely on the one cash cow and pretend like everything will always be ok!
2747 2018-12-27 19:14:27 I have anxiety about getting my oil changed because of Uncle Ed's. I hate dealing with the upsellsmanship.
2748 2018-12-27 19:14:23 Revealing where the Seals were may have been the reason f oil r the trip.
2749 2018-12-27 19:14:14 I mean hey oil isn’t going to get me through the day like my music will
2750 2018-12-27 19:14:02 Put olive oil and finely chopped scallion on them. They are delicious. Maybe it’s a texture thing for you.
2751 2018-12-27 19:14:01 I'm thinking of trying some cannabis oil...CBD...for relaxation/sleep at night. I do not like THC and have no interest in getting high, so I think the little oil capsules would do the trick. Any thoughts?
2752 2018-12-27 19:13:58 Wish your oil was changed?
2753 2018-12-27 19:13:51 Depending on where the headache is I would use peppermint oil or eucalyptus
2754 2018-12-27 19:13:11 what if i filled a juul pod with cbd oil
2755 2018-12-27 19:13:11 Is invading countries for oil and resources and blame the arabs a personal choice?

2761 2018-12-27 19:12:46 The DNC Needs to Define “Grassroots Fundraising” and they walked back big oil money pledge
2762 2018-12-27 19:12:44 Are you giving Obasanjo credit for increasing the international price for crude oil? 

Plus, why are you not blaming jona for crashing the economy but you are blaming Buhari for complaining? 

Not saying buhari is great but there are better analogies than this.
2763 2018-12-27 19:12:36 take a tbsp of coconut oil daily
2764 2018-12-27 19:12:31 With 92% of scots oil and gas revenues for 50+ years,thats 500 BN of buckshee money!, how the fuck did they end up with 1.7 trillion debt?

2771 2018-12-27 19:12:00 Food-wise I have killed it this festive season, and not just because I allowed myself to use oil and butter for the first time in 9 months of being on Slimming World. *throws olive oil around with wild abandon whilst buttering a parsnip*
2772 2018-12-27 19:11:59 I am (most of the time) on a ketogenic diet, eating roughly 60% proteins, 35% fat, 5% fibers. That translates mostly into meat and dairy along with coconut/avocado oil and/or butter with some green vegetables and sometimes macadamia nuts.
2773 2018-12-27 19:11:55 Trudeau actually tried to help the West. He had been far from anti oil. He bought a pipeline project in fact, much to the consternation of his supporters.
2774 2018-12-27 19:11:47 Way more GHG required to turn that sludge into oil than OPEC products.
2775 2018-12-27 19:11:37 Yep. ;) 
A $50K lift kit enjoys $80B each year in fossil fuel supply line defense abroad to artificially prop up gas/oil prices with FREE water use, waste dumping, and emissions of climate driving greenhouse gases...all taxpayer funded and footed for  impacts/risk. #NCA4 #SR15 
2776 2018-12-27 19:11:30 You are showing your ignorance on this issue....the US is buying our oil BECAUSE of the discount. It is the entire reason for the push to tidewater. They don’t NEED our oil, they have become an export nation...they are buying because it’s a killer deal and they can re-sell...
2777 2018-12-27 19:11:30 Nooooo palm oil :-(
2778 2018-12-27 19:11:29 You'll never find your gold on a sandy beach
You'll never drill for oil on a city street

2779 2018-12-27 19:11:01 Gotta love it when some "oil&gas guy" tries to link a story about suicide increase in Alberta, to Notley's government. One problem, the study was done 3 months into her reign.

2782 2018-12-27 19:10:34 Oil changes? Psshh. What was that? I was awful. 
2783 2018-12-27 19:10:27 My grandpa took my car for an oil change & filled my tank this morning while I was still sleeping, I  really am so blessed
2784 2018-12-27 19:10:22 Are you giving Obansanjo for increasing international crude oil price?
2785 2018-12-27 19:10:21 Don't mind him. He's just frustrated and foolishly seeking for attention! 
EZEGE1, Oil dey your head nwanne.......
2786 2018-12-27 19:10:12 Given you just bought an essential oil diffuser, your only option should be poached egg on toast + avocado

2790 2018-12-27 19:10:00 The funny thing is many Liberals are pissed at Trudeau for investing so much in the oil industry and trying to help Alberta out, but people like you will never be satisfied. Your problems stem from flagging demand and geopolitics, nothing to do with Trudeau.
2791 2018-12-27 19:09:56 This will make me very unpopular #onhere, but it bears repeating:

Whether it effects them this week (or potentially in any potential upcoming weeks) is TBD but the Colts are a very different team when they are playing anywhere other than Lucas Oil Stadium.
2792 2018-12-27 19:09:50 Speaking of owned, Big Oil Beto.

Robbie Francis himself!
2793 2018-12-27 19:09:50 No one doubts that oil companies have excellent scientists in the field. They're concerned that negative findings aren't being released to the public.
2794 2018-12-27 19:09:44 Reflections on the state of tech at the end of 2018

1. Snake oil is being peddled harder and harder, Blockchain & AI will destroy the planet
2. The web is getting slower and ever more useless with every passing day
3. Social networks are anhedonic
2795 2018-12-27 19:09:32 Hahaha. Microwave the oil in a bowl. I thought that was understood. Hehehe
2796 2018-12-27 19:09:26 So a brutal dictatorship is overthrow and oil money used to rebuild Iraq and you say we stole it.

Maybe we should have let him carry on murdering over 100,000 of his own people each year. That would be better wouldn't it
2797 2018-12-27 19:09:04 New Mexico has netted over $13 million in December’s oil and gas lease sale. The State Land Office stated that it will use the majority of the proceeds will for public schools with the rest going to other state trust land beneficiaries.
2798 2018-12-27 19:08:58 You have no idea what I do or don’t have how dare you. Have you given up all your products that are made from oil and gas buddy? #albertaproud #albertastrong #Albreit #albertaseparation #LGBTQ2point0
2799 2018-12-27 19:08:41 they treat me like VIP when i get my oil changed at walmart because they’re so geeked to drive my car for 2 seconds 
2800 2018-12-27 19:08:20 Some places like Mercedes charge you above and beyond what is actually reasonable for oil change just because they can and the brand.

2805 2018-12-27 19:07:46 Hoarse speaks with the forked tongue of a snake oil salesman.
In Hoarse's world, the efforts of the working class are to be rewarded only by whatever the corporation deems necessary for minimal survivability, but reiterates that he believes in their right to be successful...1
2806 2018-12-27 19:07:40 You kinda hinted at it in oil money gang , and if you didn’t ghost write some tracks for him @RickRoss adopted and ran wit your flow , kinda like how Wayne ran wit gillie the kids flow
2807 2018-12-27 19:07:39 You should mention your close ties to big oil and that you don’t think smoking causes cancer bc of your ties to big tobacco- then everyone will see your tweets for what they are; ignorant, self-serving piles of .
2808 2018-12-27 19:07:39 Yes! Shea Moisture jamaican black castor oil strengthen & restore treatment masque and the 100% virgin coconut oil rehydration treatment masque. Scalp massages are great too. You can get oil packets like jojoba, castor, or coconut; heat them up and massage it into your scalp!
2809 2018-12-27 19:07:37 Not trusting much of any reporting from the Guardian, that's for sure. That paper really has been reduced 2 vegan propaganda. NGO's also aren't terribly reliable either, so I'll stick to the UN FAO. Soy is grown 4 its oil as well as meal. The oil goes almost exclusively to humans
2810 2018-12-27 19:07:36 Perhaps the answer is pull out of Syria and, oh yeah, Afghanistan too, sanctions.  What's in it for #FakePresident -probably money, maybe a larger piece of the oil company, a hotel, whatever. It doesn't matter to Putin. He will never have to deliver so he just promises anything.
2811 2018-12-27 19:07:28 Mom: I’ll take your car to get the oil changed at noon and then we can go to lunch after. 
Me: awe thanks but I have an appointment at noon. Can we do it later? 
Mom: YOUR CAR IS GOING TO EXPLODE IF WE DONT. Don’t call me when it happens. 

2812 2018-12-27 19:07:22 @coopukfood I will be checking very carefully from now on, to see whether your food items have palm oil in them. I found palm oil in your gravy granules. Very disappointed!

2814 2018-12-27 19:07:07 How bout a moat, maybe some hot oil and catapults.....
2815 2018-12-27 19:07:00 If I make enough money so that my wife doesn’t have to work then she’s  gotta fill my gas tank up every week and change my oil.
2816 2018-12-27 19:06:48 But you think it’s OK to buy or oil from Saudi Arabia we’re beating a woman and flogging her acceptable. Do your homework! Alberta, the most environmentally friendly regulated oil in the world.  Back up how you think it’s dirty buddy #albertaproud #albertastrong #Albrexit

2819 2018-12-27 19:06:22 Seattle Times never mentioned this, one toxic substance in orcas. A type of chemical called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs. They’re found in coal, oil – and in engine exhaust.  
In 6 months Orca Task Force misses this
Wake up please
2820 2018-12-27 19:06:21 Thank you lmao, I failed today so I just went out a brought him the same cup so now I’m going to take off the sticker before washing it and use baby oil lmao 
2821 2018-12-27 19:06:00 Tesla has offered that, but other car mfgs are reluctant to become dependent on Tesla. They still think third parties will provide recharging infrastructure like the oil companies did with gas stations.
2822 2018-12-27 19:05:55 I tell ya
2823 2018-12-27 19:05:51 so amoy nilagang baka yung spa na pinuntahan ko kanina. hassle kasi di ako kumakain ng proper dinner but at the same time di ko alam kung magugutom ako or what kasi nahalo yung amoy ng body oil 
2824 2018-12-27 19:05:50 Take a spoon and add a drop of olive oil. Warm it up on the stove, or just microwave it for a few seconds that it becomes luke warm. And then apply it on your eyes. Massage it for a bit. A friend told me to do it and I’m trying it. I hope it works
2825 2018-12-27 19:05:40 Do u president trump realize u r destroying Texas and other oil producing states.  U will come 2020.
2826 2018-12-27 19:05:33 He’s trying to unplug all the environmental work of the 70s, just like Ryan and the oil companies wanted from the GOP all along.  He literally enabled the swamp to entrench itself.

You just keep right on writing. This is great journalism.

2828 2018-12-27 19:05:10 Who is buying Alberta's oil....... It's the fn USA.   Why would they buy Alberta's when they have their own.... Alberta needs access to foreign markets. It would be as stupid as Canada buying Saudi oil and choking alberta oil, except the states still has access to foreign markets
2829 2018-12-27 19:04:58 i have this lil essential oil roll on perfume thingie n it’s lily of the valley and it makes me v happie
2830 2018-12-27 19:04:54 And the demand has been met, and supply has exceeded it. That's why it's so cheap now. Oil output remains the same. Just claiming you're smarter than people doesn't make it so. Just like laughing at your own jokes doesn't make you funny, just makes you look like a jackass.
2831 2018-12-27 19:04:54 Plan A is the pullout , Plan B is the pill , Plan C is motor oil in her Coca Cola , Plan D is an uppercut to the stomach and Plan E is a flight of stairs with the metal lip. If you make it to Plan F you’re fucked and F is for Father nigga
2832 2018-12-27 19:04:53 Normally, causal factors aren't so clear but yes, the 2H pivot in China's vehicle market--where total sales lurched downward as EV growth blew past even wildest forecasts--did shift 2019 demand growth expectations enough to hit oil. Should add, oil was pricey at top; vulnerable.

2840 2018-12-27 19:03:46 The lines you are referring to are lines that carry Canadian oil. Like line 3 or KXL. The inter US pipelines carrying US shale oil are not facing the same issues. Even DAP still got built and is now operating.

2847 2018-12-27 19:02:57 Some previous research of mine in 2015 showed the post 2010 oil price recovery greatly benefitted manufacturing activity in upper midwest where equipment orders surged. The already stressed OSX names will sprinkle losses into this region, already pressured from auto cycle.
2848 2018-12-27 19:02:52 I hope I'm wrong - but a likely scenario is that it ends up consisting mostly of symbolic victories against oil producers etc., handouts to small orgs run by the friends of politicians, and a few flagship state-run projects that don't amount to a drop in the bucket.

2852 2018-12-27 19:02:30 Know what I’m tired of? Decades of duopoly, where both [sic] parties—the GOP & Bill Clinton’s GOP 2.0—have turned our [sic] government into a subsidiary of Wall Street, solidified the illegal perpetual war policy, rolled over to Big Oil, quashed civil rights, & so on.
2853 2018-12-27 19:02:17 How do u figure?  I thought it was popeye and olive oil
2854 2018-12-27 19:02:10 Seems to me. Pain is up. But, I’m changing my on oil now, so what do I know?
2855 2018-12-27 19:01:52 The PTF act which Buhari once headed gave him so much powers considering the funds available to him. To me this was his first stinct as Nigeria's leader. Later head of state, president and oil minister. He should stop the blame game on the past leaders. He is one of them.
2856 2018-12-27 19:01:36 Yeah, it's fun to argue with those people as an Albertan 'cause if there's one thing I understand, it's a boom-bust oil-based economy. Especially one run by conservatives who cut revenues to buy votes and then are ASTONISHED when the oil prices go bust.

2862 2018-12-27 19:00:59 The oil industry gets a really sweet deal on carbon pricing. Most of their emissions are exempt and they get to deduct every dollars they pay in carbon tax from the royalties they owe. So they aren't paying their share at all. That's what the yellow vests in France were angry at
2863 2018-12-27 19:00:59 Hi there. I'm sorry I haven't been tweeting that much, but my name is Alehandro. That's my Jewish name. I don't think the Trump's like me that much. Shirley was my voice teachers name. I met an oil mogul and they're renting out a place in the Trump Tower.
2864 2018-12-27 19:00:35 Along with all the oil money....
2865 2018-12-27 19:00:29 Compare that with pharmaceuticals, automobiles, oil/gas, aircraft manufacturing, farming, grocery stores or just about any other business. Its small potatoes. Yes it slabor intensive and does create jobs which is why it expensive to make guns and the margins are small.

2867 2018-12-27 19:00:28 Made zucchini "spaghetti" for breakfast/brunch today. High heat, some olive oil, fresh garlic, Prego chunky garden variety, sea salt and Sriracha sauce. It worked for me, and was (al dente) yummy! My veggie spiral maker is tiny, though.
2868 2018-12-27 19:00:25 Anyone good oil tycoon investors!
Please give me money!

2871 2018-12-27 18:59:33 70 damn dollars for an oil change
2872 2018-12-27 18:59:32 Yes I've been an avid reader and purchased the oil fall series over the year. What I mean to ask is whether you think it is the primary reason for the recent fall or just one of many?
2873 2018-12-27 18:59:22 Whoa, oh mercy mercy me
Oh, things ain't what they used to be, no no
Where did all the blue skies go?
Poison is the wind that blows
From the north west and south and east
Oh mercy mercy me
Oh, things ain't what they used to be, no no
Oil wasted on the oceans and our seas
2874 2018-12-27 18:59:20 Despite record low oil????
2875 2018-12-27 18:59:14 Ima go get an oil change for real today
2876 2018-12-27 18:59:00 If anyone needs me, I'll be sitting in the sun, slathered in baby oil, double-fisting cheeseburgers.
2877 2018-12-27 18:58:31 I am in the Oval Cans & unjust gave oil of man a 115 member wank blow job for another blue balls squirrel of the Rag in Texas.

2878 2018-12-27 18:58:15 Take 5 Oil Change ad is "YOLO - Your Oil Lights On"
2879 2018-12-27 18:58:10 The Libyan Council for Oil and Gas has clarified that Sharara oilfield will need 60 days after its restart to recover its production level before closure.
2880 2018-12-27 18:58:06 Not entirely accurate. The change also loosens the regs on flaring on Reservations.  Guess what the article was about?  And there was a 75% surge in US oil production in the past 2 years and consequently so has the excess that is vented or flared.
2881 2018-12-27 18:58:01 Obviously we have to give him a chance in 2019, BUT he failed to do what he was brought here to do. 
If you're paid to put an alternator on a car & you just change the oil, you'll get fired! LOL!

2887 2018-12-27 18:57:07 Charlie, if you did your homework, you would know that the DS-CIA has ruined Venezuela because they refuse to hand over all of their oil. Pick a different example....

2889 2018-12-27 18:56:56 Did you receive/give an essential oil diffuser for Christmas? Comment below  if you received one and a  if you gave one away!
2890 2018-12-27 18:56:53 Yes you are right. Repair like reducing arsenal to 30 days, bringing back the debt of 1 lac cr on debt free oil companies, subsidy back to 80000 cr fm current 20000 cr, surrender to separatists, filing affidavit that Ram didnt exist, attempt to wipe out Ram Setu.
2891 2018-12-27 18:56:50 I love watching Oklahomans fight on local news channel Facebook comments about gas prices. On one side you have the “I’m glad prices are low” people, on the other, the “y’all don’t appreciate us Jesus-anointed oil workers making this state money ghat dammit we need gas to go up”
2892 2018-12-27 18:56:50 My sister in law high af right now bc I made her eggs in @sweetblues420 olive oil. She just made a bag of popcorn and it's just sitting in the microwave. It keeps beeping but she completely forgot about it.

AMAZING.
2896 2018-12-27 18:56:34 again oil is crucial for this market....oil down market down....simple as that
2897 2018-12-27 18:56:16 What an a.. hole! 17 God Dam Years in Afghanistan is long enough and we have spend enough money and blood in that country. Syria - who cares about that sh.t hole. Does it have oil - no. We are pulling out 2,000 soldiers - that is a far cry from some type of huge military action.

Bob, can't speak for HK, who has been the master prognosticator. 

But today everything seemed to be pointing down--gold, silver, VIX, oil, yen. Been watching VIX closely for past 3 months: yesterday/today first time I recall seeing such a positive divergence in TVIX vs. S&P.
2908 2018-12-27 18:54:26 Alright moms. My daughter had a horrible cough all night and after having enough at 3 am. I started a hot shower and put a few drops of tea tree oil and lavender in the tub. We just sat in the bathroom for the steam for about 30 min.
2909 2018-12-27 18:54:26 You said this since this morning sis, go get that oil changed
2910 2018-12-27 18:54:16 I'll tell you what, if 'America' is slang for wall street and oil companies, this is spot on.
2911 2018-12-27 18:54:06 what needs to end to save planet earth & ALL inhabitants?
1- end all wars and empires that want to rule the world 2- end all bombs missiles and nuclear weapons 3- end all prehistoric energy oil coal and fracking & gas 3- clean up all pollution 4- shutdown and ban nuclear power
2912 2018-12-27 18:54:02 The oil we steal from their countries will be enough to pay for all that

2915 2018-12-27 18:53:49 You know this snake oil will cure rheumatism...it says so right on the bottle!
2916 2018-12-27 18:53:38 No one is voting for gas and oil but to label candidates now is just silly. By 2020 they'll all be singing the praises of green energy. It always takes dems 2 years to catch up to their base.
2917 2018-12-27 18:53:38 The ppl did return the house to dimms, a lot of truth. Even the establishment dimms have gone far left dragging R's along. A Freedom Caucus on both sides might right the ship
2918 2018-12-27 18:53:16 Tea tree oil, cider vinegar, rose water, honey n oats mixed together to make a homemade mask, aloe Vera, green tea can all help!
2919 2018-12-27 18:53:16 And of course I couldn't make it through the financially draining holiday season without my car demanding a $70 oil change
2920 2018-12-27 18:53:14 The oil refinery will never look better!
2921 2018-12-27 18:53:05 Easy Mark, that’s my missus!
Lol!
2922 2018-12-27 18:53:05 My Charger been having an oil leak for like 2 months  somebody come fix this shit 
2923 2018-12-27 18:53:00 All those other engines that have broken down didn’t do so because of their oil.  It’s because of the legacy of Jiffy Lubism.
2924 2018-12-27 18:52:50 Yet Cuba imports most of its food, much like Venezuela sits on some of the richest oil fields in the world, and once was the richest country in South America, but socialism destroyed it all.
2925 2018-12-27 18:52:46 Ezege You dont suppose to reply all man, 

Ur jam oil, is the major hit used by mc's in wedding ceremony in my area till now
2926 2018-12-27 18:52:46 Agree. This is excellent news on all zones so far. Regarding vanji, it would be in the company's interests to drill that too, IF the Djeno looks commercial whilst drilling. The potential production from all zones to that point, would make financial sense to try the vanji also.
2927 2018-12-27 18:52:40 Currently. Not in the future. Hence why it's stupid to invest in. See how that works? There is no shortage of oil for the transition to renewables. Hence the price drop.
2928 2018-12-27 18:52:33 Yes!! I got adorable pins and an easel and oil paints! Bob Ross here I come!

2933 2018-12-27 18:52:12 Y no da para que baje el combustible?
A mi me esta doliendo el precio del gas oil...
2934 2018-12-27 18:52:08 “oil ball“ 
2935 2018-12-27 18:51:59 Oil seems fated now to give up the entire historic repricing that began in 2003, under conditions of surging demand and real constraints on supply growth. $45 oil today is not $45 oil in 2003, of course. More like $34 inflation adjusted. The 2003 breakout above $40 is poof. Gone.
2936 2018-12-27 18:51:55 Kenney has policies! They are as follows:
1) Hope the price of oil goes back up to $100/barrel or more.
2) ...?...
Okay, he has policy.

2939 2018-12-27 18:51:43 relatedly also encourages commodity deflation in the short term since low interest rates enables financing low-return marginal production (e.g. shale oil)
2940 2018-12-27 18:51:30 If successive Tory governments hadn't squandered Scottish oil for 5 decades there would be plenty of money to go round. 
Next year an independent Scotland will have it all to herself.
2941 2018-12-27 18:51:30 Hey Tom, the @NRA can't block anything. sure they can lobby just like big pharma, big oil, big whatever. if you dont like it, vote...  Quit taking it out on Dana. obviously she intimidates you and your boyish mentality. but seriously dude. give it up.

2944 2018-12-27 18:51:18 Beto is not a candidate. He has not announced. This attack is disproportionate in every way ... and it's tacky. Who cares if he accepted donations from people who work in gas or oil companies? They're employees! They're voters! And they're free to give.
2945 2018-12-27 18:51:11 Okay at least we can say you have the oil and we know this for a fact, what do countries like Switzerland,Denmark etc have that you don't? Yet they are richer than you ...
2946 2018-12-27 18:51:09 That, sugar, cheese............. would be a lot cheaper, maybe half if gov subsidies were removed. They voted with enthusiasm to give big sugar 5 billion

2948 2018-12-27 18:51:03 The aftermath was ugly & inhumane, yes. However your “democratically elected government” led you into the mess. The US of A is responsible for your salvation, not your inevitable destruction. Selling oil by the euro’s smh.. all you had to do was agree to the justified sanctions
2949 2018-12-27 18:51:02 You ain’t said nothing slick to a can of oil I’m just waiting on my blessing

2951 2018-12-27 18:50:56 But how high will it blow.
2952 2018-12-27 18:50:55 Your economy is oil and wheat based and both have been hit hard. Most of the issue is related to transport thru pipelines,  which are blocked by judge's rulings brought on by the Natives and environmentalists. Canada bought the project,  just to be blocked by the court as well.
2953 2018-12-27 18:50:47 Better than what I’m doing! Who wants to guzzle motor oil or eat a stick of glucose when they don’t have to? Hence why I got the wedding plans under control.
2954 2018-12-27 18:50:46 Snyder can’t ever be the owner of a winner be aue he doesn’t care about the team winning on the field. He just cares about the money that can be extracted from the fanbase like oil from shale. He’s the worst robber baron we’ve seen in a hundred years. May his investment fail.
2955 2018-12-27 18:50:45 See you're still stuck in cpg landia. I found indie makers of hemp lemon oil soaps from a ~2 million $ small biz I love. Never loved soap before in my life now look forward to showering. Internet let me find products and people I legit love.
2956 2018-12-27 18:50:43 Then refine the oil and send it East to provinces that need it. When will @RachelNotley realise that expecting BC to shoulder all the danger and disadvantage of a pipeline while gaining nothing is not a viable option.

2969 2018-12-27 18:49:06 90% of Venezuela’s exports are oil and gas. That is not the case for the United States. Cmon dude. Dumb and racist is no way to go through life.

2975 2018-12-27 18:48:37 Cory Booker won't do that. He'll never attack the oil, gas, or pharmaceutical industry. He'll never go after the millionaires or billionaires. Nor will Beto. We need someone who will fight. Actively fight. No super PACs, no corporate donors, someone who's not vulnerable.

2979 2018-12-27 18:48:21 Hey sorry I didn’t get back at ya... life got busy :) So, I found some stuff debunking the supposed oil and gas money he received. But even looking at his voting recorded myself there are rightly cause for progressive concerns. But...

2981 2018-12-27 18:48:14 So thankful God didn't give me coarse hair... I dont have patience for the "I've tried everything but my hair just won't lay down" shit. God knew all I could handle was water, oil, and this brush.
2982 2018-12-27 18:48:13 I turn my older jeans into my farm jeans. It's more than oil and yard stuff. Thinking someday when we replace our washer, we should make the old one just be the farm clothes washer ;-) Like the separate machine at the fire department for our turnout gear post fires.
2983 2018-12-27 18:48:12 Venezuela does not have a similar economy to the US or Europe, they have a single product they rely on and that is oil, the US and Europe have a much more diverse robust economy, they actually produce products, this s a bad comparison.

2990 2018-12-27 18:47:36 ~might~ wear leather pants for NYE

Step 1) find and purchase leather pants 

Step 2) slather myself in baby oil to get them on 

Step 3) don’t get sweaty 

Step 4) profit
2991 2018-12-27 18:47:36 In 1776, a crack team of colonies declared independence. Today, trying to justify their bloated military industrial complex, they survive as soldiers of fortune. If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you have the oil....maybe you can hire The USA-Team.
2992 2018-12-27 18:47:33 If youre available to come model it, let me know. I got plenty of baby oil.

3003 2018-12-27 18:46:54 Importing tens of millions of ppl poorer than the ppl that live there now will equalize things. 
Not by raising them up very much, but by redistribution of resources there. Closing the inequality gap this way is a whole lot easier thn raising everyone up.
3004 2018-12-27 18:46:45 Really?...I'm guessing oil got ignited and ruined it?
3005 2018-12-27 18:46:42 My favorite Heist of all time is Big Oil.
3006 2018-12-27 18:46:38 Nope. The low oil prices sabotaged the economy. With high prices there is less need for more pipeline capacity. When prices are low you need to ship more to make money. That is why we have pipeline capacity issues now.
3007 2018-12-27 18:46:37 @CenturyTire1 I really appreciated you fitting me in for a top notch oil change!

3010 2018-12-27 18:46:18 Are you prepared to support more than just TMX? Don't we need a bigger pipeline or two going to a Northern BC port capable of handling the largest, newest, safest oil tankers?

You know that TMX isn't enough, please just say so.

3025 2018-12-27 18:44:36 But big companies won’t cut down unless it is cheaper, as they have to answer to shareholders. A better way would be to incentivise the use of recycled plastics, e.g. a tax credit or similar to ensure that recycled is always cheaper regardless of fluctuations in the price of oil!

3050 2018-12-27 18:42:15 I actually went to a Honda dealer once for an oil change at 3K and they told me to come back when the maintenance reminder told me to change the oil. Now, I just do whatever the car tells me to do.
3051 2018-12-27 18:42:15 Remember when the left existed in Alberta? Good times. Now it’s just hard right oil and gas boosterism across the political spectrum- a hospitable climate for my grandkids be damned. Alberta sucks so hard.

3054 2018-12-27 18:41:58 Yes the hypocrisy of those that bash Oil & yet rely on it for their very survival is ridiculous.

3058 2018-12-27 18:41:18 we have to look at the bigger picture - the house of saud stands because A the brits thought it useful to carve the ottoman caliphate by taking away religious legitimacy from it. And now because trumpistan wants oil and arms contracts.

*Yes*, I did kill the oil barren! And I'd do it again, damn you!
3080 2018-12-27 18:39:01 I'm pretty sure he thinks that the fact that oil donations came from "individuals" means that it wasn't "oil money" and he counts that as "debunking."

3085 2018-12-27 18:38:36 Wrong approach.  Develop oil and gas, utilize massive revenue for R&D in sustainable energy (solar, wind, battery technology) and electric vehicle charging stations and infrastructure across Canada.  Get costs comparable or below petro vehicles and people will naturally migrate.

3105 2018-12-27 18:36:56 "and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine". This suggests that the black horse's famine is to drive up the price of grain but leave oil and wine supplies unaffected (though out of reach of the ordinary worker).

3110 2018-12-27 18:36:42 Bullshit agreements? You think that’s how the signatories viewed them? That’s not true at all, and I think you know that. Obligated means bonded or compelled...the US is just as likely to intervene over oil as it is based off of NATO.

Interesting. 
U.S. military is single largest consumer of oil on Earth.
Seems our foreign policy (and wars) center around OIL.
And most of us are disgusted by this.
3125 2018-12-27 18:35:14 It depends if a bunch of purity minded jerks take over and vote for Susan Sarandon because Beto took a donation from a secretary who works for Mobile Oil.
3126 2018-12-27 18:35:13 Great job on Der Spiegel. they have sufficient info to print on President Merkel & her relationship with Putin and Soros. Now Putin owns the Venezuelan oil fields and the Open Society is meddling in elections in 81 countries w State Dept funds.
3127 2018-12-27 18:35:10 Oil prices sabotaged Alberta's economy.
3128 2018-12-27 18:35:09 When research targets few facts in a way that runs against the full record, it misleads. For ex., the Am Energy Alliance scores oil drilling Repubs at 100% & Beto at 0-7%. Beto scores 95-100% from environmental groups. Americans for prosperity score Repubs @ 100% & Beto @ 0%.
3129 2018-12-27 18:35:02 If you would care to inform yourself, you would discover that Quebec is also the province where most electric vehicles are bought in Canada and also that Quebec imports 50% of its oil from the West via pipeline. Quebec bashing as usual.
3130 2018-12-27 18:34:54 I find this very laughable. Uganda can't stand a chance e if America wanted it's oil. Its just propaganda

What was on my heart and mind this morning is the extraction of the Olive oil from the Olive. 
This is a tedious process...kinda like us. 
First the Olive has to be removed from where it grew.
That relates to how we have to be separated from

3135 2018-12-27 18:34:36 Guyananese authorities scolded for foolishly allowing private oil companies to operate in territory rightfully belonging to Venezuela. Only socialist orientated oil companies are permitted in such areas.
3136 2018-12-27 18:34:34 Everyone is obsessed with Mercedes, Audi, and Lexus and they state how they’re “quality” but yet they charge you for above a 36k mile wty and make you pay extra for oil changes.

Meanwhile my Kia gets even more looks than a lot of cars in those brands, 100k wty, and free oil.

3141 2018-12-27 18:33:54 Change your own oil. It’s free. Lol. Trust me, it’s was#y easier than going to a place that’s trying to up-sell you.

3144 2018-12-27 18:33:38 NWO member. Your whole family is evil for causing all the unrest in the world. And for what? Money and oil that's what.
3145 2018-12-27 18:33:35 When they introduce an "equality of outcome" ethos they will implode anyway hopefully or will it get worse? Maybe worse. The Board needs shedding of Zuckerbergs, then a Standard Oil type split of the business, & then regulation. Lots and lots of smothering regulation with fines.
3146 2018-12-27 18:33:31 Good thing it wasn’t an oil tanker adrift.
3147 2018-12-27 18:33:29 i've used argan oil shampoo and conditioner but that's the extent of my hair care routine. oh! and a hair treatment on the days that it's not on fire.
3148 2018-12-27 18:33:26 My credible sources in the Oil patch have a bad feeling WTI will be in the 30’s for a few months. More optimistic for the second half of the year but not much more.

3152 2018-12-27 18:33:19 Been at this dealership for almost 2 hours just to get an oil change
3153 2018-12-27 18:33:18 Go get an oil analysis at those intervals, on the same car, same engine and let me know.  I guarantee you the level of metallic solids will increase and the protection of the oil will decrease.  It is all a scam, I change my own oil (full synthetic castrol) every 5k miles.
3154 2018-12-27 18:33:17 They made Mr. Game & Watch's Oil Panic laughably bad in Ultimate.
3155 2018-12-27 18:33:15 and it's not just the state media. There's a Russian company that's been happily selling Novichok cooking oil for months now. Russia is becoming a troll-based economy

anyways have Great Holiday!!

3160 2018-12-27 18:32:58 Do not be ridiculous, #Ocasio. Florida doesn’t produce one gram of coal and there is not a single producing oil well in Castor’s district. No fossil fuel company would even consider contributing to her candidacy.
3161 2018-12-27 18:32:57 I dont wanna change my oil rn 
3162 2018-12-27 18:32:57 ......
3163 2018-12-27 18:32:45 From what i read in media, the PM has directed power producers to stop using furnace oil and instead use coal plus LNG. That doesn't seem to be a welcome development, the use of coal, which is the dirtiest energy source. Imagine what'll happen to environment then?
3164 2018-12-27 18:32:43 I love EMU oil - the cream I have really helps. What people seem to forget is that not everything will work the same on everyone.
3165 2018-12-27 18:32:42 I need me some cbd oil, birthday ideas
3166 2018-12-27 18:32:30 The dollar is largely tied to the price of oil. There are domestic issues impacting Canadian oil but the global price has also dropped which has little to do with any Canadian government.
3167 2018-12-27 18:32:15 Put some peppermint oil on your temples and the back of your neck
3168 2018-12-27 18:32:10 I'm going to shamelessly ask you what brushes you used on Procreate because this is stunning and makes me want to paint flowers on my ipad too!! 
Did you use oil paintbrush? Acrylic? Or roundbrush? Your flowers are stunning!
3169 2018-12-27 18:32:08 pumasok sa mata ko yung castor oil potek#
3170 2018-12-27 18:32:06 have you ever tried argan oil? or even macadamia oil? i use both and they're both really good for your hair!
3171 2018-12-27 18:31:59 Wow. This disappoints me.

He voted to fast track TPP.
He deregulated financial banks
lifted ban on foreign exports (OIL/GAS)
Voted for offshore drilling
Weak consumer financial protection bureau
3172 2018-12-27 18:31:59 what i have learned this week: olive oil for chapped lips and weighted blankets are everything
3173 2018-12-27 18:31:53 i'm glad you quote tweeted this. reminded me that i needed to call the dealership for an oil change
3174 2018-12-27 18:31:45 Any geoscience/oil and gas jobs in California?
3175 2018-12-27 18:31:37 Old Moonbeam Brown is one of top environmentalists idiots in the world! They stop oil flow wherever they can! That kills, murders, and stops all populations of the world to survive life. All libs thinks this, crazy!
3176 2018-12-27 18:31:37 How much oil is there in #Syria or #Afghanistan?  Asking for a (patriot) friend...
3177 2018-12-27 18:31:35 Have you tried castor oil packs hun? Works wonders! Loads of info on the net and tutorials on YouTube
3178 2018-12-27 18:31:34 god, i read the story about the mother in law and the coconut oil again. i'm not sure why i did that to myself
3179 2018-12-27 18:31:33 Had to get my car checked before I leave. Just gotta get my oil changed and my tires rotated and aligned.
3180 2018-12-27 18:31:31 Those guys are on oil not steam.  Looking out for supplies from Qatar 
3181 2018-12-27 18:31:28 Oil change completed...

I am dirty and need shower!
3182 2018-12-27 18:31:27 Insurance companies are every bit as corrupt and predatory as the big banks, big oil, big tech, etc. If they can figure out ways to game that system and screw over the public they'll certainly use them.
3183 2018-12-27 18:31:24 #CurseOfTheDeputy You cannot twist history. Yes. Saitoti, Mudavadi, Awori and Kalonzo were Vice Presidents but never made it to Presidency. But no one wants to talk about Moi who was once a Vice President. #SiasaKalongolongo
3184 2018-12-27 18:31:23 Please look up the stats on the Canada Natural Resources website. You (probably intentionally) leave out several facts which would paint a more objective view of the Canadian oil crisis. Are you an environmentalist or a nimbyist?
3185 2018-12-27 18:31:12 Is CRUDE OIL at $45/bbl a buy?  
Negatives:
Supply
Problem within OPEC?
Declining world economies
Trend is negative
Positives:
Oversold
Russia and OPEC deal
Near long-term support
3186 2018-12-27 18:31:01 Tobacco industry is like the oil companies, modern day roaches. Waiting for another way to get in and destroy what’s good.
3187 2018-12-27 18:31:00 I have never bought one.  Just mixed olive oil, honey, and sugar lol. Ashy lips ain't happening round here!

3192 2018-12-27 18:30:43 Everything depends on perspective.  Take oil for example.  If someone likes the price at say $70 and it drops to $60.  I would think you would like it more at a cheaper price.  Timeframe and perspective should apply to any recommendation.
3193 2018-12-27 18:30:42 Oil > Grease
3194 2018-12-27 18:30:36 ...Again we paused, here we traded our oil for dictionaries.
3195 2018-12-27 18:30:29 Last night I had a dream about ordering my favorite #4 extra cucumber, extra oregano basil, light oil and vinegar, kicking ranch on the side. My obsession with @jimmyjohns  is out of control  also will I ever try a different sandwich?

3200 2018-12-27 18:30:13 Oh, yeah, I should mention to tamp them almost dry from sugar water on paper towels. Wet fries and deep oil are a bad combination. Even a small amount of fries can boil the oil right out of the pot, and if you use a gas range...

3205 2018-12-27 18:29:47 My bro-in-law (commodities trader) told me years ago that futures trading is not about supply & demand but about who has the most money to push around prices. Any trader of gold & silver has watched the US Treasury/Fed rig prices forever to protect USD. Cheap oil is the new ZIRP.
3206 2018-12-27 18:29:36 Cheers Roofer just watch out for @Heid_oil she has a bit of a thing for eyes on sites. Lol
3207 2018-12-27 18:29:28 Remember all that oil wealth Venezuela had?  Remember when the Venezuelan govt took over foreign oil companies and nationalized them in 2010?  I do.  We got the money?
3208 2018-12-27 18:29:07 Essential oils! 4 drops of Oregano oil in a shot glass of orange juice. Burns like heck but works. My 3 year old son has the flu. ER visit and 104 degree temp.  Made everyone around us take oregano oil, and no one else has the flu. It is our go to “miracle oil”.

3210 2018-12-27 18:29:04 I need to go get an oil change while I’m playing
3211 2018-12-27 18:29:04 You see I use aloe vera gel every night (I’ve been doing it for over 8 months now) and this still keeps happening to me omdkdkd I never heard about oil cleansing though!!!!!
3212 2018-12-27 18:28:59 Trudeau is not acting on oil, he’s just acting!!!!!!
3213 2018-12-27 18:28:56 I mean, when you hamper new and replacement refining capacity with no offset for low income folks other than a laughably bad public transit system ...
3214 2018-12-27 18:28:52 Most innovative thing I did in 2018: brought a essential oil diffuser last time my boys and I went to AC
3215 2018-12-27 18:28:48 Blair on clean living; Morneau on cleaning up..; Cardinal Carr on holy oil; Joly on how to tuck a hair bun..; Bennett on cui bono in Cree; and @PnPCBC on what the hell do we debate if CPC s win a majority? and when will  @VassyKapelos ' voice change?
3216 2018-12-27 18:28:32 Everybody don’t see it but they don’t have to. I know what type of oil I got. Imma be in the GEOAT list. And that’s that on that
3217 2018-12-27 18:28:25 CDD oil is a scam

3222 2018-12-27 18:27:35 Looking forward to hearing from you soon. Although I think I’ve found a good chocolate without Palm Oil, it’s Green and Blacks @greenandblacks. But I miss Galaxy chocolate so please make one without Palm Oil.
3223 2018-12-27 18:27:33 No Biden. Oil Can O’Rourke is a hard pass for me as well
3224 2018-12-27 18:27:31 make your own !!!! Coconut oil and brown sugar it does wonders.
3225 2018-12-27 18:27:28 The whole world is going to revolve around LNG and not oil in the near future. We know why - but do you?  Google Gail Tverberg's work on oil.
3226 2018-12-27 18:27:21 I once said that i find dressed men sexier than naked men and my dad was like ok but like an athlete covered in oil or sth is pretty hot and I was like woah dad turn down the gay you are outgaying me
3227 2018-12-27 18:27:05 This is the worst statement you’ve ever made. Name one receiver who’s as effective without their starting QB. Of course he’s not as effective. Cars without oil aren’t as effective either. Ben not being named team MVP speaks volume of his leadership in that locker room.
3228 2018-12-27 18:27:03 Tree oil tu mmg elok pun . Aku pakai cosmoderm dulu time breakout muka aku okay wey . Tea tree oil botol hijau kalau cosmoderm . Nais gak ah ramai yg aku suggest pakai tu muka jadi elok . Tp jerawat ni mcm mna pun mesti naik 
3229 2018-12-27 18:26:55 Man at coffee store has brought 3 books and a moleskine ....has opened up his macbook and has been shopping oil change deals for 45 minutes. I am him and he is I.
3230 2018-12-27 18:26:41 I’ve been at the dealership getting my oil changed for 2 hours. They’re finally done.
3231 2018-12-27 18:26:37 Where’s our oil fund?Look at how smaller independent countries do very well.We have great resources but are unable to make full use of them because we are held back by both Tory and labour at Westminster and people like you
3232 2018-12-27 18:26:34 Tyranny and Transparency are like oil and water...they can mix.
3233 2018-12-27 18:26:30 The manager at the place I'm getting my oil changed at just gave me $10 off because GM changed the requirements on the oil making it WAY more expensive. So I'll be paying the same price as my old stuff. 
3234 2018-12-27 18:26:26 I should b thankful, seeing as the green commies are targetting Canadian oil tankers. No one is cleaning up Fukushima, or the industrial dump in the Pacific. The hijacking of our gas taxes, is a massive fraudulent, organized criminal extortion.
Communism is stupidity in a bottle.
3235 2018-12-27 18:26:25 my cousin gave me an essential oil diffuser for christmas so i am proud to announce i have been cured of every disease known to man!!
3236 2018-12-27 18:26:24 Oil change done. -60$

3241 2018-12-27 18:26:14 They’re much better than 3 years ago, but the oilfield jobs haven’t come back - according to the oil companies they’re never coming back sadly. If we can get shovels in the ground for a pipeline that will help short term

3244 2018-12-27 18:25:43 Alberta's gas is lower and we have a Carbon Tax. Also, the price of oil is way down. I wonder if that has anything to do with it?

#cdnpoli

@TradersCom @MelissaLeeCNBC
3258 2018-12-27 18:24:05 I'm sure a bunch of Federal workers who can't buy food, heating oil, gas,medicine or pay their rent or mortgage are dancing in the streets in the middle of winter singing Trump's praises. If this act of pure evil doesn't move the needle,along with dead kids, I dont know what will
3259 2018-12-27 18:24:05 Essential oils are #FragrantOils extracted from plants chiefly through steam distillation (eucalyptus oil) or expression (grapefruit oil)
3260 2018-12-27 18:23:44 @diglloyd Am having my own CBD oil company want to add a content about the CBD oil in your website[CBD Oil Information].

How much i should pay for that?

3273 2018-12-27 18:22:30 When you take a job in the government, you have to understand that shutdowns are possible and budget accordingly to prepare for such. Just like if you work in a natural resource industry (coal, gas, oil) you have to budget your money with possible layoffs in mind.
3274 2018-12-27 18:22:23 Except we don’t control the profits of our oil companies so somehow it’s ethically worse!
3275 2018-12-27 18:22:20 And who is being used by foreign interests? Have we forgotten how @HEBobiwine was used and is being used by these interests on social media to denigrate Uganda so that they can bring down the govt and get Uganda oil? Why does @nbstv not ask him these questions?
3276 2018-12-27 18:22:11 Not for money. Not for oil!
3277 2018-12-27 18:22:11 3 out 5 women haven’t changed their oil, brakes or tires since they got the car they currently have.....
3278 2018-12-27 18:22:04 Lmfao nah I’ve owned 3 cars, too. I really be trying it with how long I go without changing the oil. I need to get one this weekend, actually. 
3279 2018-12-27 18:22:00 I use CBD oil too Metta. Been sleeping like a cat lately. Nap, eat, sleep, eat, nap and repeat
3280 2018-12-27 18:21:55 My family got it for me because I use aroma therapy to calm down sometimes. It’s called asakuki essential oil defuser and it’s like 28 usd.
3281 2018-12-27 18:21:49 WHAT! You’re telling me to internally “icey hot” my body? Everyone got these crazy hacks. I’m over here downing water, inhaling peppermint oil and letting it pass. Lolz

3283 2018-12-27 18:21:29 Yo. Whatever happened to baby oil gel? That shit was so clutch in the winter.
3284 2018-12-27 18:21:25 And what’s MENTAL is ppl who are easily brainwashed & conned. Don came in like snake oil salesman and took y’all like u are nothing. Half of his followers will lose w/him but they are BW. Too gone to see it. U can’t see his connection w/Vlad? Or don’t want too. Now that’s mental.
3285 2018-12-27 18:21:17 It's pretty miraculous. From a biblical perspective there's 189 versus that talk about oil in some form or another. It's kind of hard to narrow down an exact meaning because it's open to a lot of interpretations.
3286 2018-12-27 18:20:56 Try the aspirin paste, you just crush 2 aspirins and add a drop of water then leave it on for 30 minutes or overnight (you can also add a drop of tea tree oil to it)
3287 2018-12-27 18:20:55 What is necessary to protect a tropical rain forest?
The force of the oil palm farm development continues!
Development is first! Environmental protection is the second!
The force occurs from this old economic principle!
3288 2018-12-27 18:20:54 It’s crazy that anyone would even consider pipelines and oil tankers to China from Canada to speed up that climate change!

3289 2018-12-27 18:20:49 stop making up numbers.
I have showed how GEJ/PDP develop poverty in Nigeria to 112 million living bellow $1.
show when PMB has gone above that figure, with all the fat revenue and high Oil price. 
Poverty was 61% of Nigerinas
3290 2018-12-27 18:20:40 @thespiritwoman Am having my own CBD oil company want to add a content about the CBD oil in your website[CBD Oil Information].

What is the procedure? 

How much i should pay for that?
3291 2018-12-27 18:20:35 Is it still uhhh....oil? 
3292 2018-12-27 18:20:33 간만에 울 모까 보고싶네
3293 2018-12-27 18:20:33 My fat ass got oil all on my shirt 
3294 2018-12-27 18:20:31 Because car crashes, traffic congestion and pollution impose real costs on society that are not currently borne by the companies/industries (oil companies/auto industry) enabling/promoting the sources of those costs.
3295 2018-12-27 18:20:30 • Iran Regime MP: 1,800 religious scholars, preachers hold posts in oil ministry

Panama and Egypt decide to close Panama and Suez
China controls S. China sea
Iran shuts the Straight of Hormuz
OPEC jacks oil
ISIS etal have sanctuary throughout Mid East
Russia and China cut off African minerals
NOW WHAT?
3299 2018-12-27 18:19:48 Going to Canada.  Hearing they have free oil on CNBC.
3300 2018-12-27 18:19:47 You mean the outsider who brought peace to south and north Korea? Ot the non politician who created the greatest job growth in modern history? Or the man who gave up billions to get us out of the Saudis oil grip? Which guy again? Ps. Ct is a complete mess.... nice work.
3301 2018-12-27 18:19:41 CBD oil recommendations?? Asking for a friend (also myself)
3302 2018-12-27 18:19:41 Do you think mystical fairies will fly out of the shadows and pull the wheels, brakes, unit bearings, control arms, cv shafts, motor mounts then drain the oil and chain it up for you?
3303 2018-12-27 18:19:39 I work in the oil fields... STOP making me cry! 
3304 2018-12-27 18:19:38 $SPY I remember an article about Putin saying oil markets will be very volatile till the end of the year - who knows what that means but
3305 2018-12-27 18:19:26 Possession of THC oil is a 3rd degree felony and y’all still walk around with that shit lmao.
3306 2018-12-27 18:19:16 That black extreme sports kt tape ripped chunks of my skin off even after lacing it in oil before trying to remove it...
3307 2018-12-27 18:19:08 I know, I always try to avoid this shit, that's why I decided to move at this time. Still trapped.

3309 2018-12-27 18:18:58 Please and thank you  RT @devv1017: stop acting like y’all get high off these oil pens
3310 2018-12-27 18:18:57 No thanks. Keep it in the ground. That oil is dirty as hell and costs more to get to market than it makes. If you want to blame someone for the pipeline failing, talk to Stephen Harper who stacked the energy board with oil lobbyists that decided to skirt the consultation process.
3311 2018-12-27 18:18:55 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。

3315 2018-12-27 18:18:40 Damn you and your well read-ness and your nice looking shelf with the oil diffusing reeds.

3317 2018-12-27 18:18:21 .@CNBC  look at the $VIX.    What about Natgas.  It tends to go opposite of oil.  Possible polar vortex in Jan
3318 2018-12-27 18:18:15 Absolutely Noel. @broightergold is exceptional oil.
3319 2018-12-27 18:18:09 Twitter is not your forte.  Maybe you should stick to changing oil at Jiffy Lube.
By the way, you can totally watch videos on YouTube that will teach you the difference between your and you’re, and there, their, and they’re.  Then you’ll be an expert!
3320 2018-12-27 18:18:00 Welp, just got back from the local Car Shop and have bad news for our everyday use vehicle. Mechanics found too much metal in the oil. From what they said and my father said, it pretty much means the end for that vehicle. 2001 ford explorer 180k miles, buhbye "Big Red" #badcarday
3321 2018-12-27 18:17:50 Clove oil only helps toothache because you start to think about how god fucking awful it tastes and how you want to die rather than your tooth
3322 2018-12-27 18:17:42 Thicker oil and silicone(?) oil additives worked wonders last time, made the valve guides/piston rings let less oil through.
3323 2018-12-27 18:17:37 any fossil or plant to make oil  an made silver of it self god made coal of it self God did not need any help made these thing ! so put this way God no not your face nor name ! out of luck !
3324 2018-12-27 18:17:24 been there done that. it'll go down as a great memory over time. almost makes you forget about all that $$ down in the oil pan
3325 2018-12-27 18:17:23 I bought this aphrodisiac body oil the other day and honey... when I tell you. It is it.
3326 2018-12-27 18:17:16 Me and my friends are like oil and fire. When together we cause destruction but it’s beautiful.
3327 2018-12-27 18:17:14 How much money did these two make?????
Why close down brand new office buildings in Houston & move your offices too DUBAI? 
Could it be a head qurters for more human trafficing?
Did you make a lot off of all those children & people?
Just saying

3330 2018-12-27 18:16:58 Sorry, sir, I think you ignored politics and economics mixed in oil and gas sector. One field where the biz has Government backing when things don't work out...
3331 2018-12-27 18:16:52 ADAM's the ultimate score, kid. No more grifts. No more scams. A monopoly on ADAM makes Standard Oil look like the Piggly Wiggly.

3333 2018-12-27 18:16:41 i swear by tea tree oil and witch hazel.
3334 2018-12-27 18:16:33 Do you mean when Pakistan was protecting Bin Laden but we had to pretend he was still in Afghanistan? Or when ISIS was controlling swaths of Iraqi territory, and we were not knocking out their oil supply?
3335 2018-12-27 18:16:28 Jura !?
3336 2018-12-27 18:16:13 Hey, while Trump works on behalf of Russia, Putin announces hypersonic missiles. And while Trump works on behalf of oil and coal, CO2 emissions rise to the highest point in decades. Anyone concerned?
3337 2018-12-27 18:16:11 You mean like Norway which puts a substantial portion of profits from oil into a sovereign fund that will continue to benefit the populace for decades after their oil is depleted?
3338 2018-12-27 18:15:54 I hope for your sake that Mongolian Grill has some tea tree oil for her
3339 2018-12-27 18:15:51 on the whole, American shale oil companies never made any money... its a train-wreck! - billions have already been lost with many more billions going to be lost..
3340 2018-12-27 18:15:44 Blanket criticism of "taxes" is also pathetic.  Next time you have an issue re roads or policing, you could take up a neighborhood collection, Frank, and assign the work among the locals.  Or maybe ask why Imperial Oil pays income tax at a lower rate than you do.

3347 2018-12-27 18:14:55 Fake news AND fake science all in one mashable video. And I mean real 'fake news' not Trump fake news. So slow the anti-coconut roll. Canola (rapeseed) oil is an extremely bad one, and it's all over!

3355 2018-12-27 18:14:21 Literally (yes, literally) every single advertisement in Midland International Air & Space Port is directly related to drilling for oil, which really helps you guess the exactly one reason people would come here
3356 2018-12-27 18:14:14 Hey @fordnation it's called slumping global oil prices Don't say you aren't like Trump... Lies, doing whatever you want regardless of what "the people" say & taking credit for things you have nothing to do with. What a joke.

3359 2018-12-27 18:13:46 I hear that there are dogs who do not eat mass quantities of flour and oil and honey and whatever else they can reach, and also dogs who are willing to lie on floors. My dog is neither of these types of dog.

3361 2018-12-27 18:13:42 As an advocate for marijuana/THC use to treat symptoms of anxiety (SEVERE ANXIETY in my case) ... I suggest y’all try CBD OIL because it has actually really worked for me!!! I really doubted it for a loooooong time but have found so much relief from vaping oil.

3372 2018-12-27 18:12:55 2 hours for an oil change and still can’t get it done incredible service by @Honda
3373 2018-12-27 18:12:53 I was busy over the holiday, so I’m just catching up that people were upset over Beto’s oil record being publicized? That he’s not very progressive? Jesus, people. Politicians are not our friends.
3374 2018-12-27 18:12:47 Matter of fact they’re all scared to death. The beginning of next year looks terrible. Blame it on who ever but a bunch of companies left to BC to drill oil.
3375 2018-12-27 18:12:22 But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil.
3376 2018-12-27 18:12:19 You could create a sovereign wealth fund using an oil tax, and use that to fund a basic income. But might there be other ways to supplement  everyone with their daily needs ,allotments, food forests, solar panels & home generation to provide mostly energy independence.
3377 2018-12-27 18:12:11 Thank you, Rick. I am a Texan and an oil producer but the US LTO industry shot ITSELF in the foot, not OPEC. "Don't Mess With Texas" meant getting in debt to the hilt (Whoop!) and NOBODY has breakeven's below $50, not facing mountains of debt. Don't believe the shale oil dookie!
3378 2018-12-27 18:12:10 I would like films sex with you
3379 2018-12-27 18:12:03 Sadly, that applies to everyone. We’re all zombies, believing what we want, finding data that supports our predetermined concepts. Political, religious and scientific. We’re all listening to snake oil salesmen who are selling us what we want to buy.
3380 2018-12-27 18:11:53 I am not the actual target audience, but yes. If I am forced to have direct skin contact with garbage, dirty dishes or other things like grease or oil I'm getting the creeps. I manage to do it if I have a few minutes to get the right mindset, but it is still freaking me badly.
3381 2018-12-27 18:11:50 Decided not to get a oil change for some months and now I need a new engine 
3382 2018-12-27 18:11:42 So does that mean if the Government bought enough wine none of us would have to pay taxes? It could be like Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, but based on wine rather than oil

3386 2018-12-27 18:11:29 The idiot mayors of BC that sent letter are not representational of BC residents. The majority want pipelines and many BC families rely on the oil patch to support their families.

3392 2018-12-27 18:11:04 Yes & if they (big oil companies) can mitigate their damage by implementing things like new forests & carbon extraction processes they can get their bill down a bit. If they don’t the tax has to go towards similar programs.

3396 2018-12-27 18:10:52 The loss of stock exchanges had nothing to do with the discovery of oil; the LSE - a private co. owned by its members then - chose to centralise all of the UK's stock exchanges into London. For example, Wales had 2. There were 27 UK exchanges in total.

3407 2018-12-27 18:09:36 Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11.. there were no weapons of mass destruction. Our sons and daughters died for oil.
3408 2018-12-27 18:09:35 Mexico has oil, year round agriculture, protection of the US military, fabulous tourist sites.  And it was described as a "hellhole" by pro amnesty Sen. Graham.  Gotta be something cultural.
3409 2018-12-27 18:09:34 Castor oil pack  with a heating pad works wonders.
3410 2018-12-27 18:09:25 Edgerton's ace new book presents the story in its full complexity - oil crisis through to early 80s certainly a dark period. But most of what transformed UK in the 1980s had zero to do with the EU - abolition of exchange controls, Labour market changes, foreign policy choices.
3411 2018-12-27 18:09:24 High Yield Energy Debt- How many oil producing companies with go bankrupt? Some small ones have, more to come most likely before bottom.
3412 2018-12-27 18:09:16 Best oil to cook with! Healthiest! 
3413 2018-12-27 18:09:00 This isn't right.  Leaving aside that they've redefined "subsidy", why attribute these "subsidies" to the fossil fuel industry, rather than all the industries and final demand categories (ie: you and me) who USE fossil fuels?  Is it Big Oil's fault that we buy/use the stuff?
3414 2018-12-27 18:08:58 The S&P report did not give a rating for an iScot in 2014. It did say in 2017 Back in 2014, when the oil price was above $100, an independent Scotland could have received a rating between A and Baa, placing it within the investment grade bracket.
3415 2018-12-27 18:08:49 @elonmusk Marijuana is a medicinal herb that's woody and grows very quickly. After harvest buds the woody plant is tossed. 
That same wood could make Biocrude oil.

3416 2018-12-27 18:08:35 Again man, basic civics. The Constitution is not so easily amended, you should probably read up on the process.

No thanks, no fighting for bankers and oil for me. I'm an American, not Team America World Police, and that's not cowardice it's called critical thinking.
3417 2018-12-27 18:08:10 I TOTALLY get that, but unlike Snake Oil/But Wait There’s More/Funemployed it is not a universal idea (But Wait there’s more might fall into the same issue, but I have not met anyone that didnt know infomercial tropes). But once again, for fans of the grapps it is GREAT!
3418 2018-12-27 18:07:46 Yes they do! I was at La Saj last night & had to ask for a bottle of olive oil for the hummus.
3419 2018-12-27 18:07:37 Entirely agreed. Asia is not going to wean off FF any time soon. My belief is that ’s oil, LNG is a meaningful step we could/should make a concerted effort to supply if our intent is to really impact global emissions.
3420 2018-12-27 18:07:30 It is a shame you are tagging a very important person next to your juvenile tantrums. Woman, go hang a transformer. There are two choices in 2022 for Kenyan president. One is Dr Ruto and the other one is Dr Ruto. Guess what, you can do nothing about it!

3430 2018-12-27 18:06:25 Think of it as a sealant, glue and lubricant. An oil seal to prevent the bread getting soggy, a glue to stick the bread to the filling and a lubricant to help with chewing and gobbling it down.

3442 2018-12-27 18:04:43 The elephant in the room, concerning your article, is the economics of Saudi production vs the Permian.  Shale production at least 10 times more expensive.  Saudis have always produced through history no matter what the price, shale production always at risk from low oil prices.
3443 2018-12-27 18:04:42 Years from now we will look back on some VCs the same as we do snake oil salesmen.
3444 2018-12-27 18:04:39 We all subsidize oil and roads, and car manufacturers.
3445 2018-12-27 18:04:33 I'm still trying to figure out why "inflation" is "ex food and energy" when oil is $120 but "economists" include it when oil is $30

3456 2018-12-27 18:02:58 If stocks were valued at non-speculative valuations (which I realize is just a crazy dream) I doubt they would drop much if oil prices collapsed. Oil industry related stocks would get pounded, but would tech stocks, for example? Then again, bank stocks would suffer, so who knows.
3457 2018-12-27 18:02:50 RSO Fans:

3473 2018-12-27 18:00:45 Motor oil must protect against corrosion of engine components. Oxidation of the oil and contamination from condensation and combustion by-products cause acids to develop in the engine oil. Additives in the oil are designed to combat these acids.
3474 2018-12-27 18:00:40 The 2020 primaries won't be about "new" or "different," they will be about solving real problems. The biggest and most urgent problem is climate.

Beto has now learned that taking money from oil&gas interests makes him suspect to people who say we must address the climate crisis.

3477 2018-12-27 18:00:28 Norway and Alberta have totally different models.
Alberta uses royalties to avoid the high capital costs of investment and interest associated with long term large scale oil sands projects.
Norway has no royalties and takes an equity interest.

3483 2018-12-27 17:59:42 It may be worth a try in a different form. Im not sure of the exact mg or ounces, but I balanced my amount in a 1/3 ratio to vape liquid and usually after a few hits it calms me a good bit. A lot of CBD oil pharmacies may have flavors...the one that I went to did & it mixed well.
3484 2018-12-27 17:59:36 Maybe not if you try CBD oil
3485 2018-12-27 17:59:32 If Beto and Hickenloopoer continue to talk up oil and gas then they will not have my support. But if they change their tune I am still quite open to them.

3490 2018-12-27 17:58:41 There's a purpose for being there, it's because the US dollar is the only form of currency that OPEC will accept for payment for oil and we do whatever the oil barons tell us for that right. #PETRODOLLAR
3491 2018-12-27 17:58:40 In some areas, up to 12% of Underground Storage Tanks have leaked so much oil, it can be measured in feet deep across the top of water sources! This contamination is avoidable with regular inspection and proper care of UST’s, including removal of UST’s.

3506 2018-12-27 17:57:13 No they did not! 
Norway drilled lighter offshore oil with quick payouts and took an equity interest.
Because of high capital costs for the oil sands Alberta went the royalty route to avoid long pay outs and interest.

3540 2018-12-27 17:54:09 was finna clean my car out and get my oil changed but this weather gmfu

3543 2018-12-27 17:53:59 Ok Mr Q
3544 2018-12-27 17:53:37 They are only making more laws to justify they're jobs. They need to see the patients in the SNF, they have included the war on drugs to include medications. The 50/50 blend oil would be ideal. DC stopped the pain meds,but put nothing in place for pain. They need to learn. Xo
3545 2018-12-27 17:53:37 Anybody promoting something that can be done with inexpensive ingredients & then offering the expensive-easy fix- seems suspect, but these liver cleanses with salts & olive oil work well & r old medicine.

3548 2018-12-27 17:52:57 Literally, even my MOM has suggested CBD oil to me...
3549 2018-12-27 17:52:57 Are those the same fields that used to be owned by USA companies? When Maduro is gone there will be no money and no oil.

3551 2018-12-27 17:52:54 A half fiasco. The rulebook is a good thing but all countries must buy EPRs to switch off much coal, oil and gas soon. Wind and sun are not a baseload.
3552 2018-12-27 17:52:54 Life saving tip:
Never pour oil into a half cooked beans.
3553 2018-12-27 17:52:27 Yes, Marcus, Scots are so happy to fork over 92% of their own oil profits, 45% of their own taxes that UK Treasury keeps to subsidize a govt that asset-strips them
3554 2018-12-27 17:52:18 getting snow’s oil changed today.
3555 2018-12-27 17:52:07 Thanks, I grew my patience last couple years haha playing with mediums that require of you to grow your patience is the best way to fight unpatience, so try it sometime if you want to (gouache,watercolors, oil paints especially)! It's nervewracking but good for your growth.

3558 2018-12-27 17:51:45 A friend of mine in a third world country makes Palm oil and sells it so they can send their children to school.
3559 2018-12-27 17:51:05 A nice example of the production boundary; cleaning up a contaminated area counts as an investment. Which makes sense (even when the contamination itself wasn't counted as a negative). But clearing pristine forest for the production of palm oil also counts as an investment....
3560 2018-12-27 17:50:54 I work 16 hrs a day in the oil and gas industry. Trust me my life is mundane. You on the other hand seem to be in another line of work where I can see it being risky whether you’re on a cruise ship or not. People are crazy especially ones that think they are about to get laid.
3561 2018-12-27 17:50:49 That's what you think . England will need our oil and our electricity . Do you really think they will cut off their greedy noses to spite their faces . Think again  #DissolveTheUnion 
3562 2018-12-27 17:50:44 Because of gas we can afford heat. As soon as a renewable form of heating is readily available for a reasonable price, I'm all in. Until then, I, and most of the rest of us, have to take what we can get. Anyone who heats with oil, kerosene, or electricity knows I speak the truth.
3563 2018-12-27 17:50:40 Thanks, just tomato, avocado, and red onion with pink sea salt, cracked pepper, garlic powder, oregano, and parmesan. I drizzled it with some olive oil, and after I was done I cleaned the plate with a small 5 grain Italian roll. 

It.
Was.
Really.
Yummy.
3564 2018-12-27 17:50:39 True but we need to also realise that we are not even amongst the top 10 oil producers in the world to continue subsidising everything....I honestly think that the government needs to give those schools some level of autonomy.

This is where the very big truck rally for Alberta oil was held.
3566 2018-12-27 17:50:13 If you give me 10 dollars I’ll make you an oil painting for free
3567 2018-12-27 17:50:09 Dae trying to grow that hairline back...  I didn't know that G fuel had snake oil in it?
3568 2018-12-27 17:50:03 The capsules with natural enhancements was heavenly! My body was so calm! I didn’t feel so stressed! I could tell myself you will make it , hot bath with CBD soap! Is great for flare ups, oil never worked for me
3569 2018-12-27 17:49:59 CBD oil has helped with my concussion and sleep issues, my sister’s Lupus, my husband’s chronic sinus infection, my son’s anxiety and SPD and my dog’s paranoia :: we are with your older relatives! 
3570 2018-12-27 17:49:55 I believe that is what he calls himself! Unless it’s his followers that are parroting him, everyone else knows Trump is a  snake oil conman who has lost most of his inheritance, is in debt up to his ears to Russia and perhaps Saudi Arabia as well.
3571 2018-12-27 17:49:48 Jeet's point on this is that in the coming year Trump could turn to  Cheney & "say hold my beer." He is itching to invade Iran & Venezuela "for the oil" because armed robbery & protection racket is how he thinks.
3572 2018-12-27 17:49:44 My dad is cheap and he thought my car used synthetic oil which is liek 48 here
3573 2018-12-27 17:49:38 Went to the dealership for an oil change & leaving with a new car... thanks grandpa you the real MVP
3574 2018-12-27 17:49:37 So....if you got under the hood of a used car, dirtied yourself up, changed all the spark plugs, the oil, and all the filters...you wouldn’t brag to the men in your life of this accomplishment?
3575 2018-12-27 17:49:30 I was concerned abt the cfpb votes and the fin services votes. The oil votes seemed mainly tied to his state and immigration votes sounded like special pleading on Sirotas part. It was hard for me to evaluate since it was written in the same posture as the biggest ...
3576 2018-12-27 17:49:28 "United States, in concert with Saudi Arabia and Russia, oppose the Paris Agreement and deny humans are responsible.. These three countries represent the top three oil and gas producing countries in the world, accounting for over 40% of global hydrocarbon production."
3577 2018-12-27 17:49:21 not v calm, are they? vehicle sounds like it could have used some oil.. wonder where their fragmented psyches ended up? That desert sure has stories to tell and ghosts to bury..

3580 2018-12-27 17:49:03 The story behind Velikovsky's prediction of Venus surface temp, Venus/Jupiter radio emissions and the reaction of academic's to being schooled by a guy they all said was crazy should be used to shut down all false CO2/Global Warming myths, implicate both Green/Oil boys in scam.

3584 2018-12-27 17:48:45 Let forget for minute ur plan to do, all the works of course. A state with hefty oil allocation can implement a scheme today to solve most if not all the poverty. Why don't ur type implement a welfare scheme so that the citizen can have a piece of the oil wealth? Thank me later.

3591 2018-12-27 17:48:17 "As concern about climate change mounts, the economic potential of used cooking oil has never been greater" I know it's late in the year, but this is one of the leading non-sequiturs of 2018.  Just amazing.
3592 2018-12-27 17:47:53 Coconut oil really does wonderssss for skin
3593 2018-12-27 17:47:53 I am not surprised...you type loud than you can think. You cannot fathom a single coherent argument. Good luck on your next landing.
3594 2018-12-27 17:47:50 To much oil TankGod for u
3595 2018-12-27 17:47:44 Ship has sailed, amigo. The time for incremental “market-based” solutions was 20 yrs ago, and you didn’t wanna hear about it then. I’m sure your position had nothing to do with how much the oil lobby has contributed to your campaign.
3596 2018-12-27 17:47:38 If #Alberta had no immigration, didn’t pay all of its GST & a good portion of its federal income taxes to other provinces it too would have a trust fund the size of #Norway. In addition Norway’s oil is running out whereas Alberta’s isn’t as it has one of the largest oil reserves!
3597 2018-12-27 17:47:32 I need an oil change. Welp, i don’t NEED one yet, but I need to get one before I need one.
3598 2018-12-27 17:47:21 “Avocado oil? What the hell is going on in here”

3606 2018-12-27 17:46:29 The problem is Trudeau is hypocritical about oil. He needs to make a decision and move from there
3607 2018-12-27 17:46:26 Oil need changed and it’s on E

3609 2018-12-27 17:46:15 You don't care what the Constitution says? You are a traitor, undeserving of that uniform, and a disgrace to this country. I didn't serve, but I would gladly die to protect the Constitution and the US from enemies both foreign and domestic. No need to fight in oil wars first.
3610 2018-12-27 17:46:08 Lavender essential oil 100% pure,
A few drops in the palm of your hand rub on your chest, and tummy,  it is better than med you get from doctor

3612 2018-12-27 17:45:40 my mom just accidentally dropped some chili oil into a cup of jasmine tea and I think she might’ve done something .....
3613 2018-12-27 17:45:39 Our provincial government definitely did not help...but they cant control pipelines and canada bringing in oil from overseas.  We are landlocked and forced to sell to the Americans at a ridiculously low price which hurts all Canadians.  We need to work together.  East to west.
3614 2018-12-27 17:45:29 Manufacturing and maintaining wind turbines does create jobs. So what if we subsidize green energy? We've subsidized big oil for years, and it's effects are disastrous in terms of pollution, accidents, public health and worker safety.
3615 2018-12-27 17:45:28 Detailed proposal on currency arrangements(I did economics at uni), how we would convince Spain to let us into Eu(I don't believe they ever will),how the 'loads of oil money' is possible given our climate/carbon commitments-a plan-same info we critique the brexiters for not havin

3619 2018-12-27 17:45:00 Why are nuclear weapons safest in the USA, why does the USA rush give military aid in counties with oil reserves?

3627 2018-12-27 17:44:09 I wish the NATO forces could invade Myanmar for the sake of humanity and hunt down these filhty SOBs. 
Oops, no oil in Burma. 
Sorry, just "relief work" should do.

3629 2018-12-27 17:44:06 I have the same thing, pounding headache! 1.5 doses of daytime cold and flue relief + 500 mg. Extra tylenol, nettie pot 3 x's a day, thieves (essential oil mix) from health store (my mom)... and sleep! Usually this does it.
3630 2018-12-27 17:44:05 So far nothing in the dossier disproven, and several points are dead on, like this Prague meeting, 19% sale of Rosneft oil, etc.

3637 2018-12-27 17:43:06 I just paid to get my oil changed with a $100 bill and dramatically pulled it out and made a sound effect I really didn’t mean to
3638 2018-12-27 17:42:26 No specific numbers but BP, sHell, Chevron, Total etc have been selling off their North Sea (oil) assets and multinationals are also selling up in Nigeria, Gulf of Mexico (Exxon) , Tar Sands etc. Gas and renewables seem to be a safer investment for them.
3639 2018-12-27 17:42:15 *calls baby daddy to do my oil change cuz I hate doing it myself* 
3640 2018-12-27 17:42:12 That article blatantly broke their published ethics guidelines. 

If you read far enough the author contradicts themself and says the international differential for heavy oil is $8 in Asia. 

Let's go with the $40mm per day we are losing instead of $80mm. And then let's fix it
3641 2018-12-27 17:42:05 Oh god yeah! Perfect description. All advice greatly received, thank you, wheat bag a great shout. Find Olbas oil steam gives temporary but instant relief

3643 2018-12-27 17:41:53 Honestly I had a lot of canned tuna plus chopped cucumber with Trader Joe’s everything but the bagel seasoning. Steamed veg and pan fried meat with ghee or coconut oil. Lots of RX bars which are “not encouraged” but fuck that noise. Coconut milk was my favorite milk alternative
3644 2018-12-27 17:41:45 Ohhhhh so it’s an up and down cycle. She me the last time they were this significantly low and the last time we exported more than imported oil?
3645 2018-12-27 17:41:33 I recognize that, Permian Basin Grew up in Roswell, the biggest building in town was the 8 story Hinkle Building, built by small NM oil barons and full of offices of oil companies.
Most went bust after Permian got harder to pump.
Coming back a bit I hear, I moved away long ago.

The oil was warm by now, soaking it up from Alec's skin and Raphael shivered at the feel of it against his own. His fingers playing through Alec's hair -
3650 2018-12-27 17:40:58 Horrible service.  Don't return calls.  We have purchased 5 vehicles through this location and are going out of town on sixth.  Even with an appointment it takes hours for an oil
change and when vehicles are delivered have to call multiple times to schedule pickup
3651 2018-12-27 17:40:53 O.M.G. In our household, if we ever run out of olive oil or oregano it’s akin to being the end of the world.

3659 2018-12-27 17:40:16 America also subsidizes carbon fuels.    We fought a $3 trillion dollar war to keep oil costs down.  We subsidize coal by ignoring the problems it causes.  We subsidize cars and roads and then wonder where all the traffic comes from.

3668 2018-12-27 17:39:42 Simple! Arugula-small chunks of beets-some goat cheese and walnuts. Dress with your fav olive oil dressing. Done! Russian collusion happened in my kitchen! Oh and I watched Anna Karenina, Dr. Zhivago and War and Peace.
3669 2018-12-27 17:39:40 Why are we aiding Saudi aggression and helping them commit genocide? For access to oil? Our participation in the slaughter and starvation of Yemeni citizens is unforgivable. I’m horrified.
3670 2018-12-27 17:39:37 Well according to the chud blacksteel, they seem to not want cheaper and full heath coverage, not do they wanna go to college debt free. They love fracking and oil drilling, even though that hurts their neighbourhoods more disproportionately. 
I don't know how it's possible 
3671 2018-12-27 17:39:17 WALL STREET JOURNAL, BUSINESS & FINANCE POSTS "OIL'S GAIN FOR THE DAY IS BIGGEST IN 2 YEARS"! Good for the Stock Market bad for the Trump consumer base pundits. "Economy not as bad" says Market Analysis Phil Flynn, maybe Flynn like's paying high gasoline prices for excessive $

3673 2018-12-27 17:39:11 That’s one company out of many. There were other issues that led to the bankruptcy that you have no clue about. And I’m pretty sure they weren’t subsidized the way oil companies are. They were given a $535 million loan. Not the same as a true subsidy. Look it up lol
3674 2018-12-27 17:39:03 I couldn’t suggest the Tom Ford soleil blanc shimmering body oil enough if u wanna embrace the golden angel u are 
3675 2018-12-27 17:39:00 +3. For riverine areas deploy Coast guards for swift patrol. Build all weather towers like those we see in oil rigs or floating bases so that no infiltration takes from river side. For patrol can be equip with hovercrafts which are very reliable.
3676 2018-12-27 17:38:55 Anyone that serves in the oil and gas industry should be able to figure out that the world has released a tremendous amount of CO2 into the atmosphere since the first commercial oil well was drilled in 1859.
3677 2018-12-27 17:38:55 Imagine how healthy AB coffers would be, if they had reasonable provincial taxes through the oil boom...
3678 2018-12-27 17:38:51 Unfortunately, you are wallowing in your own wisdom. Your wisdom is beyond schooling. You are too rigid to think for once in your lifetime!
3679 2018-12-27 17:38:50 Cult of Beto (who sucks off the toes of the oil industry) is complaining about the Cult of Bernie pointing out that Beto sucks. 

America is a terrible country lmao
3680 2018-12-27 17:38:45 Clove oil isn’t even worth it I’d rather have toothache 
3681 2018-12-27 17:38:44 Latest DIY beauty product. Lip Balm: shea butter, olive oil, beeswax, raw honey and rose essential oil. DELIGHTFUL.
3682 2018-12-27 17:38:39 Stop importing oil from countries with lax environmental standards.
3683 2018-12-27 17:38:38 Note, Port Harcourt is a special city  you need to understand this because of the oil nature of the town, actually, not a super business environment, it is harsh. Compare cost of living to other cities and the options people will have in terms of standard of living
3684 2018-12-27 17:38:35 Well.. It's time to go buy CBD oil... ...
3685 2018-12-27 17:38:28 Here's  a thought. IS oil used as a heat sink by the earth ? The more oil that is drawn out of the earth the less heat sink available.  Any thoughts?
3686 2018-12-27 17:38:20 It’s simple really, high dollar, low oil, @realDonaldTrump tweets, slowing economy = a terrible stock market. Not to mention @realDonaldTrump polices killing market.
3687 2018-12-27 17:38:19 The main cause of climate change is greed + our politicians chronic bidding to the $ interests of Big Oil & Coal. Indeed, energy is the driving source but we wouldn't have this problem today had world govts started regulating back when scientists said this was coming.
3688 2018-12-27 17:38:18 The squeaky wheel gets the oil
3689 2018-12-27 17:38:09 I. Need. An. Oil. Change.
3690 2018-12-27 17:38:07 For the first time in years we’re exporting more oil than importing. Don’t you think the gas prices correspond to this?
3691 2018-12-27 17:38:05 Thunder fire you with KNOWLEDGE sir, the OIL in your brain will never run dry and your Generation will speak of the GREAT things you did!!!...You are highly blessed
3692 2018-12-27 17:38:02 Wonder what Big Oil Beto will choose
3693 2018-12-27 17:37:39 I'm not a fan of Trump's methods re: #syria and #afghanistan, I don't know what our "national interests" are there any more. In Syria, humanitarian reasons makes sense but that's not what we are doing. Why are we in the middle east? We certainly don't need the oil.
3694 2018-12-27 17:37:35 Remember when boy genius from Queens was saying how we should grab the oil? It shall forever be known that #MAGA #OrangeISIS @POTUS gave the best oil in Syria to ISIS and IRAN. Something for the @SenateGOP @HouseGOP to be proud of in 2020. We'll make sure they get credit. @WHNSC
3695 2018-12-27 17:37:32 I need you to rescue two hostages from an underwater oil field. Agent Sherry Birkin…and Jake Muller. He`s Albert Wesker`s son.
3696 2018-12-27 17:37:19 How is England funding Scotland? Billions of Scottish Oil has been squandered balancing the U.K. budget. While Scots continue to pay Taxes to Westminster with a minimal return. 
3697 2018-12-27 17:37:16 Oil gains most in two years on stock rally, Russian reassurance: Crude gained as U.S. equities… @environmentguru
3698 2018-12-27 17:37:16 MARKET WATCH: NYMEX, Brent oil prices rise after pre-holiday slide: Crude oil prices rebounded on… @environmentguru
3699 2018-12-27 17:37:16 Did he you fail to remember the gains under the first year and a half? Also, gas prices have never been so low, do you thank him for our lack of foreign oil dependency to these prices?
3700 2018-12-27 17:37:09 You could also look to his votes on banking deregulation, or his lack of corporate donors. Who’s better, Oil Beto?
3701 2018-12-27 17:37:07 $NUGT, $GDX, $JNUG, $SPX, $QQQ, what really amazes me about Precious Metals miners here is that not only do you have Gold and Silver moving higher, but you have Oil nearly cut in half at the same time and market hasn't priced any of this in at all yet.  Margins will be expanding.
3702 2018-12-27 17:36:58 sprinkled some lime juice, paprika, b.pepper and olive oil on chickpeas* and roasted. And kidogo garlic.

Elixir of Life ndio hii sasa. Right after celery juice and whisky. And a toddy. in no particular order :)
3703 2018-12-27 17:36:55 Russia only cares about suppressing its oil from being on the market and use of its ports for future naval fleet and airbases for its nuclear bombers... Venezuela debt is not a primary concern
3704 2018-12-27 17:36:55 All of your spending is with borrowed money. Look up "DEBT" in Wikipedia. 

Canada's economy is a slow moving train wreck. You've set it up to fail by decimating the oil industry. Your reckless spending will be paid for by our grandchildren.
3705 2018-12-27 17:36:53 Not only that but we’re running out of time on climate change. We can’t afford another oil money bought centrist.
3706 2018-12-27 17:36:52 So US is subsidizing Sweden and Finland's military budgets, and Sweden and Finland fund their welfare from oil wealth. Ok, sure.

3709 2018-12-27 17:36:12 It actually has a lot to do with Powell the fed chair being a dumbo, bc he keeps raising interest rates. Also bc strong dollar and weak oil. Less so of actual politics.
3710 2018-12-27 17:36:09 My windshield wipers and tire fixed on my car FINALLY... Now all I need is a oil change and my Baby ready for the WINTER 
3711 2018-12-27 17:35:56 Is that's why Goldman was advising clients to buy oil at $70?

3714 2018-12-27 17:35:39 road to last year final semester, future engineer + SHO certf  oil n gas confirmed
3715 2018-12-27 17:35:31 How do you restructure your debt when everything you have, except oil, is worth zero. That sounds like a very bad idea.
3716 2018-12-27 17:35:18 Stomach flu has hit my household, well all except myself.  Blackberry juice, elderberry syrup and thieves oil saves the day!
3717 2018-12-27 17:35:04 Nigeria is in trouble with these topsy-turvy oil prices in 2019!. Not good for forecasting economics! @YlanreTVC @tvcnewsng
3718 2018-12-27 17:35:01 Oil trading 3% lower a smidgen under $45 a barrel after yesterday’s 10% surge.
3719 2018-12-27 17:35:00 Baby oil works wonders lol
3720 2018-12-27 17:34:33 Albertans in the oil patch, like Ontarians in the auto industry thought that the gravy train would never end.  Kept buying bigger homes, bigger boats and bigger pickup trucks.  Now they are looking to blame someone for the reality of their debts. #cdnpoli
3721 2018-12-27 17:34:16 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
3722 2018-12-27 17:34:15 Best guess for this image, somebody had some kind of burning oil and they tried to put it out using the toilet.
3723 2018-12-27 17:34:03 At the moment, need a new tire, oil change & an alignment

Taken in front of the Pure Oil Station, now The Mountaineer. On the right is the First National Bank (corner of Depot & Main) that later became First Union.
3729 2018-12-27 17:33:03 Hahaha. Ducking hell James. You’re a right off bod. PSG are a grim club! ‘European Super Power’ are they fuck. Nothing before oil money. Shite. You’re one of these modern hipster tits. 

Have a great day.
3730 2018-12-27 17:33:01 They’re beneficiaries of and stalking horses for big pharma, big oil, payday loansharks, for-profit prison slavery,  wars of choice, etc. They’re two of the people most responsible for the right wing wave and Trump. Aside from that....
3731 2018-12-27 17:32:41 First I get hot oil in my face, then I cut the hell out of my finger, and then I get gas all over the open wound
3732 2018-12-27 17:32:27 Plus the bus at the stop was not in use, "oil change"! The next bus after a 40 minute wait was full. We walked today. #sad

3734 2018-12-27 17:32:17 I wonder what would happen if I used olive oil in diffuser before falling asleep

3736 2018-12-27 17:32:14 I sacrifice the beard oil and just brush it. I know I am doing a disservice to myself but boy does the cost of upkeep, GEEZUS.
3737 2018-12-27 17:32:11 If this doesn't work I'll give it ago. I'm a bit weirded out by it TBH. But I've also tried every other oil and they haven't helped.
3738 2018-12-27 17:32:05 one of the bakers on cake wars put mayo in their cake bc mayo has oil and eggs. They didnt even put actual oil or eggs into their cake just the mayo..
3739 2018-12-27 17:32:04 ...even the oil puddle....
3740 2018-12-27 17:32:00 Today after VA hospital then oil change. Its time to eat, do laundry and game. Black Ops 4 on deck with some Madden 06 on OG XBOX. Maybe Battlefield 5.
3741 2018-12-27 17:31:44 Yep, oil's still there. 
3742 2018-12-27 17:31:36 1/2 Ok Let's do a Ben Franklin as we head into year end.
Bear Case
1.Synchronized global slowdown (exacerbated by Trump/Trade)
2.Restrictive monetary policy in  G-7 (ex-BOJ)
3. Paucity of wage growth
4. Populism runs rampant
5. Wealth destruction weighs on sentiment/capex
6. Oil
3743 2018-12-27 17:31:14 The oil and gas industry have at least a 30 year wind-down. They're just not going to go away overnight, nor can it. That's simply reality. But not to worry, the market, which I usually complain about, will decide for them...the market will be on the side of renewables.
3744 2018-12-27 17:31:11 I’ve never understood why people cook ground beef in oil when it makes its own
3745 2018-12-27 17:31:11 O’Rourke is a corporate democrat who is riding a big wave of popularity. I really hope he doesn’t get the nomination, because he accepts all kinds of money from oil lobbyists, insurance companies, etc. he’s bought, like so many other politicians.
3746 2018-12-27 17:31:06 Out of curiosity, how does it compare with the oil & gas industry, in terms of receiving government subsidies?
3747 2018-12-27 17:31:00 2 different shampoos one conditioner a hair oil a beard oil a brush a pick a comb and a sponge when I’m feeling it. Bruh lol
3748 2018-12-27 17:30:46 Mix 9 oz corn with 8 oz cookies. Mix into  Olive Oil. Allow to harden Serve over kale.
3749 2018-12-27 17:30:33 Definitely not impressed with Pai Skincare and definitely not impressed with their Rose hip oil. Did not see any difference. 3 more weeks and then this goes in the trash. Waste of money!

3751 2018-12-27 17:30:20 Would be interesting to see that - manufacturing aluminium involves mining bauxite then high temperature processing BUT is almost infinitely recyclable. Cling film will have similar input externalities (extraction and processing of oil etc) but tends to be single use (1/n)
3752 2018-12-27 17:30:16 BREAKING: Your favorite Dem is in the pocket of Big Oil, which is why they've always been so eerily quiet about climate change.
3753 2018-12-27 17:30:12 Well, oil may have tanked, but thanks to bc we are saving the planet with our 1.40 plus gas price.
3754 2018-12-27 17:30:06 If you’re reading this get yourself some pure jojoba oil. Use it on your face! Your body in place of lotion! Your beard that fully connects! Your crotch to make it silky. EVERYWHERE 2019!

3756 2018-12-27 17:29:49 Frying up Indian "crunchies", as my American friends like to call them, for NYE & burned my thumb. Note-To-Self - don't touch the part of the frying spider that goes into & has been sitting in the oil. Stings like a MoFo.
3757 2018-12-27 17:29:48 Sorry I meant I am very bearish on gold and equities. I am a former deep value and contrarian fund manager. Only asset I like in 2019 and the next couple years is oil and gas. Thanks!!!
3758 2018-12-27 17:29:44 I just got an oil change what a scam

3761 2018-12-27 17:29:26 Yes....yes it is 
3762 2018-12-27 17:29:24 I've been using corium luxe oils rosehip and tamanu, boy have they made my skin more oil than it already was. 
3763 2018-12-27 17:29:22 On same basis and theories which promoted statins and demonized coconut oil and ghee?
3764 2018-12-27 17:29:20 #Regulatory_barriers are put in place to prevent #Enviromental_Catastrophes! Something that #Oil_can_Alberts don't understand, because they regard it as #Black_Gold$ when in reality it's #Dirty_Money! #Trudeau #Liberals are the best choice #in_2019!
3765 2018-12-27 17:29:18 I assume you feel similarly aggrieved over oil and gas industry subsidy as well? Please let the Conservatives know at the next meeting.....

3774 2018-12-27 17:28:38 But Edmonton is oil country. You have transportation costs with Toronto. Besides, Edmonton has Connor McDavid. That should count for something.

3777 2018-12-27 17:28:23 We do not count emissions when that oil is burned into the air. Finger pointing has to do with adverse climate change due to burning fossil fuels into the air, no matter where that happens.
Should we leave Colombia alone to deal with drug addiction in USA?
3778 2018-12-27 17:28:23 Probably the guy that will make their lives exponentially worse, seems to be the prevailing attitude at the moment. Market forces caused the problem, they’re also the only “quick” fix. Sadly oil companies are making excellent profits, and they’ve automated the jobs that are gone

3784 2018-12-27 17:28:13 The dude @ the oil change place gonna tell me I need synthetic oil .... bitch I have a 09 Civic. I am not dumb, don’t make me call my dad up here
3785 2018-12-27 17:28:12 Disclose your financing then. Then ask all the Koch brother, etc. groups financing you to disclose ties to Big Oil. Then provide communication history to show no collusion of funding through your dark money trail.

Else it is a Big Lie?
3786 2018-12-27 17:28:10 Hepatitis b Cure होता हैं क्या???  इसके लिये कोनसा Oil अच्छा है???
3787 2018-12-27 17:28:04 Exactly! We're all getting boned up the you know what...! Also saying we should be paying 0.80/liter is being quite generous,it should be more like 0.66/liter. Refiners have had multi year record profits by buying cheap oil and off of the backs of the consumer. #YellowVestCanada
3788 2018-12-27 17:28:03 Had a crazy migraine (the nauseating kind) but I think I fixed it with a couple drops of peppermint essential oil on my temples, tons of water, green tea and cannabis.
3789 2018-12-27 17:27:59 Used an oil combo in my diffuser to help relax me to sleep last night & keep me asleep... I had the weirdest freakin dreams I’ve ever had in my life  1 I can’t remember Bc it scared the crap out of me. 
3790 2018-12-27 17:27:57 That's the worst thing about these snake oil merchants, their con is insidious
3791 2018-12-27 17:27:57 Economies go up and down. Alberta's in a rough spot because of the questions around the oil industry. That's more on the provincial government to fix than Trudeau. Now I'll certainly say he could be doing much more for Alberta. Most politicians are all disconnected
3792 2018-12-27 17:27:46 Got Quinn's car an oil change, went grocery shopping, cleaned the whole apartment. Now just waiting for my laundry to come out of the dryer and gotta mail the rent. Yay for productivity
3793 2018-12-27 17:27:41 Miss that Olive oil smellin ass nigga!! 
3794 2018-12-27 17:27:40 The funniest thing about being the artist in the family is that they think you be working on easels, using oil paint, getting it all over you, when you really just be holed up sketching and hunched over a desk. I don’t even correct them, it’s so funny.
3795 2018-12-27 17:27:32 Yeah, found olbas oil gives temporary but instant relief, need to get some saline involved
3796 2018-12-27 17:27:10 Laneige perfect cleansing oil, cosrx low ph gel cleanser
3797 2018-12-27 17:27:08 Guys - essential oil diffusers are just alternative candles.
3798 2018-12-27 17:27:08 It looks like #oil traders fix the #OPEC problem, it will soon be lack of oil with the price they trading on for the time being. Oil price will skyrocket after that.
3799 2018-12-27 17:27:06 $YUMA need news for gas and oil play, Qatar buying up reserves now no longer part of6 OPEC

$WTI $CHK $MRO $USO $MOSY
3800 2018-12-27 17:27:03 They want $99 for an oil change only

Even though they have a sign that says $25

Hell no
3801 2018-12-27 17:26:58 We bought a gas Passat 5 years ago at 0%. Average 6k miles per year at 30 mpg. In that time we've spent $200 on oil changes, the first 3 years were free. Odds are we'll keep the car 15 years, with maintenance, etc., $1,800 per year. Why do I want an EV?
3802 2018-12-27 17:26:50 I'm not old enough to remember that, but I'm furious for my entire life that I've been failed on the issue of climate change. I had multiple opportunities to join the oil and gas field and turned them down for moral reasons. Candidates like Beto or Clinton have failed us. 1/2
3803 2018-12-27 17:26:48 Just like oil companies paying for think tanks to publish climate change reports? Or tobacco companies paying for doctors to comment on smoking? Sure, the truth eventually outs, yes. But more slowly.

It obviously isn’t irrelevant, or they’d publish it and be rid of the critique.
3804 2018-12-27 17:26:43 Neera Tanden smeared @davidsirota for raising the huge oil and gas donations to the O’Rourke campaign—2nd most to only Ted Cruz. CAP cyber-bullies piled on, then corporatist media concocted an imaginary “Get Beto” cabal to turn O’Rourke’s broken promises into an attack on Bernie.
3805 2018-12-27 17:26:33 Dear Facebook: We hear you’ve formed a partnership w/ The Atlantic Council, which is funded by Big Oil & those cuddly cute Koch Bros., to identify & eliminate “Fake News” from FB. At what point did Mr Zuckerberg decide that Right Wing Tyrant was the shirt that fit?
3806 2018-12-27 17:26:21 after a 40% drop my signal says to short oil. $USO 

*Shorts $USO while holding nose

3807 2018-12-27 17:26:03 Coconut oil will clog your pores. Try tea tree oil
3808 2018-12-27 17:26:03 Peak oil is expected to hit within the next few, very few, years. After which, demand will will precipitously decline. Read @politicalham in Energi News for well researched details
3809 2018-12-27 17:25:58 I'll oil it

3811 2018-12-27 17:25:53 Kusema ukweli, Nigerians hype jollof rice a lot but its just spiced mchele njeri...lots of oil and chilli plus stock cubes
3812 2018-12-27 17:25:53 Yes, but the feds are not really doing anything to push it through.

Another thing... They could have forced Energy East to happen and removed eastern Canada's reliance on Saudi oil.
3813 2018-12-27 17:25:38 About a nickel to quarter size of oil in the palms, work into the beard up to the skin. The balm is similar, but may provide structure for shaping. Get those knots out with the comb, though honestly I prefer a cheap plastic comb, does a better job for me.
3814 2018-12-27 17:25:31 Am aware of both dimwit but tar sands oil also & mainly came from Canada. Alberta Canada. All for export and not needed.
3815 2018-12-27 17:25:18 Cheers which oil do you recommend?
3816 2018-12-27 17:25:17 Especially not Europeans who are the second biggest consumers of oil in the world...and oh just so happen to import most of it...which comes largely from Russia and Gulf Arab states. Makes you think 
3817 2018-12-27 17:25:03 I’m gonna follow the trend of these other Tampa photographers and make a model slap oil on herself, put on some lingerie, and shoot in a random location
3818 2018-12-27 17:25:01 oil paints are definitely my favorite medium, but they need so many additional supplies, hence it will cost a lot of money 
3819 2018-12-27 17:24:58 five things I love that aren't people —

1) oil diffusers??
2) tv shows that you get lost in
3) my bed
4) hospitals 
5) ice and mint gum 

no. i wouldn’t like to elaborate
3820 2018-12-27 17:24:58 Nothing has changed China in trouble with drop in business, oil in trouble because USA getting its own oil from shale (which is a better quantity than middle East light oils) Trump my man gotta them all on the run including issi and the Mexican bandits
3821 2018-12-27 17:24:54 I need to change my oil.
3822 2018-12-27 17:24:48 all the folks talking up this market action as an image of 2008 could be right if $DB goes into receivership under the German govt. They'll get their 50% correction plus $20 oil. Same ones are forecasting $700 gold from Elliott Wave charts.
3823 2018-12-27 17:24:46 oooooo, i have coconut oil would that work? ik it’s heavy oil 
3824 2018-12-27 17:24:40 Totally agree with you. She really is an oil painting!
3825 2018-12-27 17:24:20 Good. I have great respect when people back up their talk with money. I am now long. The battle is on!!!! Haha. I think oil bottoms first half and then surprises on the upside after.
3826 2018-12-27 17:24:18 You need some little schooling. 'Good' is relative...it is in the eyes of the beholder, so to speak. What is good to you, is not necessarily good to someone else. Ability is different. Some people are able, others are unable. Unfortunately, you are unable to understand.
3827 2018-12-27 17:24:11 Go to the oil change place on Jamaica Ave near Hempstead Ave they give you a free car wash with the oil change
3828 2018-12-27 17:24:09 Obama takes credit for this oil boom. He can drop 26,171 bombs around the world kill innocent people around the world for oil and the serfs will still love him. Then they talk about Trump? This did not happen during Trump.
3829 2018-12-27 17:24:00 You gotta use an oil. Your face produces excess oil when it needs it. Combat oil with oil
3830 2018-12-27 17:23:58 Me: *In assembly in year 5*

3831 2018-12-27 17:23:32 Yeah but have y'all tried CBD oil?

3837 2018-12-27 17:23:05 Stocks have been pilling up cause furnace oil plants have been offline or operating at very low capacities. 

Imported FO has been banned for over a year. The ban was liffited for two months in May when two refineries went offline and there was FO shortage
3838 2018-12-27 17:22:55 Yeah, but the problem is the patchwork of government subsidies supporting - for example - the oil (and related industries) to the detriment of EV growth.  Needs govt buy-in to fuel the explosive growth that’s required.  Tesla is running uphill, sadly.
3839 2018-12-27 17:22:44 Meat and oil.
3840 2018-12-27 17:22:38 i always rub coconut oil on my lips and i have no idea why since i dont think ive ever seen anyone say you should do it nor do i know whether its good for my lips at all

3842 2018-12-27 17:22:25 No.  Its to implement every existing efficiency tech on mass scale.  The shift pays for itself.  Mandatory net zero buildings. Ban all pre-LED bulbs. Force a quicker shift to electric cars. Ban oil heat in new construction.
3843 2018-12-27 17:22:24 At start of winter there is.
+ Hydal Available 
+ Gas for Power available 
+ Low electricity demand
+ Almost no utilization of FO mainly used in electricity generation.
Refinrys refine crude oil to produce Petrol etc. FO is what remains unrefined and stocked in refinry tanks.

3845 2018-12-27 17:22:21 Uh, I think you should be asking Mahathir this, instead of me. He is the one making hundreds of millions of new debt, at a weak currency, weak economy, dropping oil and commodity prices... Is this a responsible Government's actions? DS Najib's policies was cleared by e.g. Moody's
3846 2018-12-27 17:22:08 It's only a matter of time. You all can continue the false propaganda as much as you want. Perhaps the goal of big oil/gas executives will be met which is to enrich themselves before they die, but eventually it will be a universally accepted known truth that climate change 2>

3848 2018-12-27 17:22:02 I really don’t know what to tell you at this point. Israel is literally stealing our oil yet you found that to be anti-Semitic, and you’re gonna be defending them regardless of what I tell you, because you overlooked one too many massacres.

3854 2018-12-27 17:21:45 I am aware of how the EQ system works. And personally I'm for it. But, Alberta has always had the judgemental eye of Canadians. We only want to ship our oil. We're in the sand box with everyone else but we're not allowed to build a castle. That's not right.

3856 2018-12-27 17:21:40 Brexit would be a victory for the climate change-denying environmental vandals: big oil, big sugar, big tobacco. EU rules protecting the environment and workers are exactly what they wish to remove. You must fight the battle on more than one front.
3857 2018-12-27 17:21:39 出た出た(*∩ω∩)
3858 2018-12-27 17:21:33 Because it takes a lot of time and energy to change the course of an oil tanker.

3864 2018-12-27 17:20:49 Probably because the producers in the oil business are a very influential government lobby group...
3865 2018-12-27 17:20:39 I had some of the edibles that worked great but when I bought a bottle of CBD oil it wasn't really effective and I paid 50.00 for it.

3869 2018-12-27 17:20:27 All governments in the Middle East would shit their pants if America decided to pull out completely. So would most of Europe, Russia. Good luck with oil supply & paying your own way fighting the radicals yourselves I'd tell them.
3870 2018-12-27 17:20:25 So i read Mr Otedola is selling his 75% stake in forte oil and he is looking to invest in oda petrol chemical product. I have two petrol chemical products that would b a very good investment with good financial rewards now dat cash will be available to invest
3871 2018-12-27 17:20:17 Orange juice just made the taste of castor oil not so bad.
3872 2018-12-27 17:20:14 For example @BarackObama dropped 26,171 bombs in 2016 alone, deported 3.2 million and prides himself as facilitating the biggest oil production. He also endorsed a war criminal like Hillary Clinton. Nobel Peace prize, welcoming, ecologist hypocrite.
3873 2018-12-27 17:19:58 Yes it's true "Oil Tot". I voted. Hehe. Love your polls so I couldn't resist.
3874 2018-12-27 17:19:57 Mind u we r importing wheat soya beans for cooking oil and maize . So much for a success
3875 2018-12-27 17:19:54 Orange juice don’t work without the castor oil. I did all of those things and AJ finally came. My cousin told me to do it. Sperm softens the cervix so Ken need to come buss it down 
3876 2018-12-27 17:19:50 You folks assuredly have shorted deferred oil futures contracts. With that kind of opinion one could ill afford to let this opportunity pass.

3880 2018-12-27 17:19:38 Same problem 50 years ago!! Must understand that results depend on LOCAL implementations, teachers, training, curriculum etc.
Common Core is English & math, not checking oil, insurance, cooking, bill paying.
Maybe you should report your concerns about grad needs to DeptEd.

3886 2018-12-27 17:18:54 When oil prices go up, it hits everybody now.

When house prices go up, it's delayed. It only hits a small number of people this year but the number grows every year - home buyers this year, next year and so on.

Another difference - Housing expenditures are much larger than oil.

3890 2018-12-27 17:18:35 And, no one wants oil and gas production “in their back yard.” Thus, everyone wants gasoline in their car but no one wants to have to see the production, transportation or refining processes.
3891 2018-12-27 17:18:29 Venezuela was destabilized to steal it's oil. Wake up.
3892 2018-12-27 17:18:27 Was after the revolution some dishonest people throughout libya had been stealing money before the LNA army came in was not just in Tripoli, now the army is making it very hard to steal by stopping n holding the oil.

3905 2018-12-27 17:16:49 Well that’s a population supply and demand problem. Controlling how humane those places are is an ongoing battle but we can’t all just take supplements until that’s fixed. May as well try to get a worldwide boycott on oil to make them allow new covered up energy methods

3907 2018-12-27 17:16:33 Standard oil (Prescott Bush) sold their oil to the Germans without which not a single German plane would have taken off. Digest that #Britain. IBM sold counting machines to Auschwitz. Henry Ford built the train tracks that led to Auschwitz, and sold tank parts to the Germans.
3908 2018-12-27 17:16:32 My view, all Canadian oil and gas projects were a train wreck by design.  If your investing in it,  bail out before it's too late.

3910 2018-12-27 17:16:15 Nigeria has one of the biggest oil reserves in the world but large oil companies are let into the country and exploit the lands for profit and the Nigerian people get nothing. 
3911 2018-12-27 17:16:13 Let's not pour oil on the fire of speculation though...
3912 2018-12-27 17:16:03 North Dakota has temporarily allowed flaring in the Bakken to facilitate oil production but they are imposing tighter limitations to end gas waste in due course. No one likes wasting gas but it’s done if there are overall economic incentives to produce oil now rather then wait
3913 2018-12-27 17:15:58 The habit of frying yam with olive oil in the absence of groundnut oil must end in 2018 ooo...
3914 2018-12-27 17:15:57 He has a great combination of fundamentals (mentioning oil and inflation) plus a decent human psychology read (difference between Powell [not touching QT] and Williams).

(If I can make one criticism, I don't think dollar strength has much to do with real interest rates.)
3915 2018-12-27 17:15:50 Those will be his constituents. If he sets policy by what they want he will vote against efforts to reduce oil usage. He needs to tell them he is going to find them new jobs and end our oil dependence. Sure it's a hard thing to do, to say it  and even harder to make it happen.

3935 2018-12-27 17:13:36 Maybe look into how much the oil patch pumps into our economy. Trucks from Ontario. Steel from Ontario. The taxes paid by the workers.

3942 2018-12-27 17:12:53 Henry Ford and Prescott Bush were among many war mongering profiteers who sold weapons and oil to both sides of the war in WW2 a crime for which both families escaped completely unscathed.
3943 2018-12-27 17:12:43 We cannot (or rather won’t) do that because the greatest use for US dollars is for the world to buy OIL. If theres no need to buy oil then our dollars become worthless. It’s quite a pickle we have got ourselves in. Like it or not, oil will run out, and renewables are the only way
3944 2018-12-27 17:12:42 I think it's all out of ignorance that you are attacking Phyno.. For real he dropped hits From onyeoma, ISI Ego, Fuwa sewa, One chance ft kranium, NWA ft wale, Iwa ft Tekno to oil and Iyulife all this year. 
Maybe you talking about controversies not music..
3945 2018-12-27 17:12:42 I can't wait to see #Trudeau's face when he learns that airplanes run on jet fuel derived from.......OIL!!
It might be another industry that needs to be "phased out".

3948 2018-12-27 17:12:18 Apologies..Youre absolutely right.. Oil prices more than halved and petrol prices hardly moved in the UK.
3949 2018-12-27 17:12:09 Solo para mantener el purismo liberal pregunto? Mantendrá el gobierno el subsidio de precio sobre gas y oil. Porque mucho me temo que a precios de hoy el shale aquí non va!!!

3953 2018-12-27 17:11:13 Giving it an acronym right out the gate is like having it show up in a labcoat while wearing a mortarboard under an astronaut helmet, and people STILL line up to buy the snake oil.
3954 2018-12-27 17:11:12 Yes. Yes. And Yes. And why Donny likes coal and oil.
3955 2018-12-27 17:11:02 I agree wholeheartedly with @elonmusk comment "Betting that science is wrong & oil companies are right is the dumbest experiment in history by far." But how do I afford to make the change to renewable energy cars when the only Tesla that would fit my family of 6 starts at $84,000
3956 2018-12-27 17:10:55 Funds from where? We are currently borrowing and servicing debt in an unsustainable manner. Even the budget is based on unrealistic figure and oil benchmark. You want FG to keep pumping money when funds previously given ASUU hasn't been accounted for..
3957 2018-12-27 17:10:55 It was garlic oil.
3958 2018-12-27 17:10:54 funny, cause university of southern California officials state he was with son at u s.c ,your nothing but a snake oil salesman
3959 2018-12-27 17:10:41 Wonder what will happen if the US gets up to 50% EV ownership. Will oil production and the stock market still have some correlation?
3960 2018-12-27 17:10:27 It is, but they don’t care. Just like “oil cleaner” and “injector cleaning”. Neither are needed but it’s a high profit up sell.
3961 2018-12-27 17:10:19 髪がさーサラサラしてるのちょっと気にしてんだよなー
3962 2018-12-27 17:10:18 Not true. The producers want to sell the gas also if they can. However, they are willing to forgo that value in oil-prone areas in order to produce oil, which has more value than the gas.

3964 2018-12-27 17:10:03 Scheer’s MO is to retail blatant lies and  issues criticism without alternatives.

But kudos. His one great idea is to complete the armoured vehicle sales (avoiding Harper’s ridiculous penalties) and exercise sanctions through reduced oil purchases. Worth careful consideration.

3967 2018-12-27 17:09:39 Strange to mash so many things into one pile and call it public debt. You're right about the oil sector, though. Alberta once saved the money, but then Klein just burned right through it. They also didn't invest in refineries and pipelines back when they would have been doable.
3968 2018-12-27 17:09:39 But it's not all oil and gas workers affected. The conversation is that the oil sands are hurting, which the conservatives claim in Trudeaus fault
3969 2018-12-27 17:09:31 I could anoint you with the Oil of Healing...but I’m not rubbing it on your chest. A blob on your forehead is usually enough!
3970 2018-12-27 17:09:22 I’m sorry, I only prep oil cleanses with essential oils. How about a lemon basil thyme prep?
3971 2018-12-27 17:09:03 I thought tea tree oil was supposed be the holy grail of every inflammation
3972 2018-12-27 17:09:01 Love the Fairway! Hope you got some primo olive oil in there!
3973 2018-12-27 17:08:58 Hopefully today is the beginning of a long climb to 0 for oil. It will happen eventually. You really want to be holding a useless resource that we can not afford to use?
3974 2018-12-27 17:08:57 Import ban will help utilizing local furnace oil from Pakistani refineries. If we don't, prepare for shortage of Petrol, Diesel, Jet fuel, etc. etc.

3978 2018-12-27 17:08:20 .. inability to suppress oil and gas production in fracking-enabled competitive environment pairs rather disastrously with unsupportable levels of spending on anything, including morally bankrupt adventures that generate returns countable mainly via body bags and maimings.
3979 2018-12-27 17:08:18 Jose do you get your CBD oil in NY, or you order it online? I have a herniated disc but there’s so many brands of CBD oil, I don’t know which one to get.

3983 2018-12-27 17:07:55 Personally never been able to achieve those levels. Not even combining MCT oil/Ketologic Exogenous ketones or a 3 day fast. Highest I have achieved is 1.7mmol And I stick to less than 30gr carb day

4067 2018-12-27 17:00:08 I'm big into oil. I own lots of it and I know what it smells like. It's rich smelling. The smell itself spawns property and mansions.
4068 2018-12-27 16:59:49 Thanks Vivina :) hmm yeah, would be hard to tell if it's the oil or just time doing its thing, wrt a scar healing over some six months. Been reading conflicting things but didn't know anyone who used it here. This helps.
4069 2018-12-27 16:59:45 If not for oil money, Nigeria for no dey anywhere. I have never seen economic players that lack creativity like in Nigeria.
4070 2018-12-27 16:59:42 Then if you take that into the context of global oil demand, it's like 0.4%.
4071 2018-12-27 16:59:31 Energy in depth lies for fossil fuel companies. The cost of the wars for oil (or even just the iraq war) could have gotten us free green energy for every home in America
4072 2018-12-27 16:59:23 yeah, ok.. 10x shifting a gear thru a city to get to the highway?  I don't drive in open land oil patch.
4073 2018-12-27 16:59:16 @anasalhajji can probably answer this with more precision, it's relatively inelastic, but it can add and subtract marginal barrels at low and high oil prices, respectively. 400k b/d swing both ways.

4080 2018-12-27 16:58:28 Since manufacturing already went into a recession with the last oil crash, we don't have that over investment like we did in 2015. We haven't even regained all the mining and extraction jobs when before the first oil crash

4092 2018-12-27 16:57:43 Simplistic. KM pipeline was enormously viable. Hypocritical opposition from outside Alberta - people who benefit from living in one of the richest countries: wealth driven significantly by Alberta oil - killed it while at the same preferring to insult, mock & disparage Albertans.

Same exact thing can be done with Bernie and bankers.

4111 2018-12-27 16:56:18 Good thread, two responses:
1. A carbon tax is definitely not sufficient, but one is definitively necessary, if only to address the “green paradox” (TM Hans-Werner Sinn)
2. A very good starting point is $1/t universal severance tax at point of extraction, oil, natural gas, coal.

Does vit. D still help if you don't get enough sun? (My blood was tested and I had vit. D deficiency)
Do those fish oil capsules do anything for your health (brain)?

Thanks!
4114 2018-12-27 16:55:46 Olive oil, avocado, meat,eggs, nuts and seeds instead of buttered coffee and no problem
4115 2018-12-27 16:55:39 It really depends on the oil you're using, not the car. Newer/higher end synthetic oils last a lot longer than traditional motor oil

It does seem that DS is playing the martyr.

4119 2018-12-27 16:55:24 My father used to always buy his gas from an "unmarked" station owned by a fellow named "Gus Heenan," around 57th and St. Louis. Nice guy. Claimed that his gas was from a "major company." Cleaned the windows, pumped the gas, checked the oil. All for $.29 a gallon. Pretty sweet!
4120 2018-12-27 16:55:24 Sorry I've just re-read this.

Are you actually suggesting that the oil revenue data has somehow been fudged by the ONS and a complicit Sc Gov in order to somehow make Scotland look worse?

I mean you know what happened to the oil price, yeah? Why would Nicola lie?

4128 2018-12-27 16:54:26 It's the results that clarify my stance , you can't defend the fact our kids can't even check their own oil , cook their food or pay their own bills . Of course half those bills were caused by socialists .like socialized corporate insurance. The nation's school system is a farce!
4129 2018-12-27 16:54:24 Palm oil?
4130 2018-12-27 16:54:14 The issue is that the carbon tax isn't going to reduce fuel use.   When fuel prices rose when oil prices were high, people cut back on OTHER things, like eating out (which is easier to adjust) rather than buying a smaller car.

4134 2018-12-27 16:53:55 Harper didn't save Canada in 2008 on his own. OPEC cut production in 2008 causing oil prices to rise and thus helping along most oil producing countries through the great recession.
4135 2018-12-27 16:53:46 "Mr. Shale" is actually the Texas Railroad Commission. The TRRC can legally, thru statutory laws, slow down shale oil growth by restricting the no. of LTO wells per acre and distance between wells. It would stabilize prices, employment, shale oil debt and conserve America's oil !

4144 2018-12-27 16:53:14 You’re hip shooting. Flaring is done in oil prone areas such as Bakken and Eagle Ford because they can’t produce oil without also producing gas, but there is no pipeline available for the gas. Oil can be trucked.

4150 2018-12-27 16:53:04 Ok read it. So you can put cash in the bank (good) or you can spend on services & infrastructure that attracts new industries which AB has done (also good). Norway’s gdp is still heavily weighted to oil and services, AB has gone the diversification route.
4151 2018-12-27 16:52:59 Papa Bush went to Afghanistan to smuggle opium to his CIA.

4162 2018-12-27 16:51:42 Nope. None of that. 

It’s Moslem countries voting as a bloc and others submitting (only!) because of oil. Nobody wants to pay more for a needed resource than they must so it’s always “please opec time” at the UN.

You need to do better than that...

4197 2018-12-27 16:48:06 Just announced: Gretchen Whitmer has picked @lieslclark to run MDEQ -- the new director has a background in clean energy... a change-up from some recent directors who worked in the oil industry.
4198 2018-12-27 16:48:04 He is only doing the “wall” to revamp his crazy voters. Europe is doing what needs to be done too. Increasing the oil prices is a necessity. Europe is cutting ties with the US waging war against the dollar. Unbothered by trumps coziness to Putin and Edrogan

4203 2018-12-27 16:47:57 Get oregano oil pills and take 1 every 4 hours + rest! It works wonders for me.
4204 2018-12-27 16:47:55 Use top grade oil and gas every time unless the car is in lease.
4205 2018-12-27 16:47:52 People are gonna be thinking I’m going nuts on tinder when your boys just tryna see some cars, glass, and oil

4209 2018-12-27 16:47:38 You're still doing that hypocrite stuff.
GERS was bullshit in 2014 but accurate now.
Explain why you think it miraculously became right just about the time that the oil price dropped.
Game,set and match.
4210 2018-12-27 16:47:32 If you really think pumping trillions of tons of carbon and pollutants into the atmosphere has no effect on the climate, you don’t deserve the right to comment on such matters.
4211 2018-12-27 16:47:13 Yo, I can be your oil sister too
4212 2018-12-27 16:47:07 It’s a numbers game. Non-brand places will gladly use lower grade lubricants, half the price of the dealer, but you would need to change twice as often as the oil degrades with use faster. Meanwhile, one is changing 2x for inferior product that costs the business less to stock.

4216 2018-12-27 16:46:31 Man, we will never run out of oil. More oil deposit r being discover everyday, why, better technology. My prediction is that as technology continue to be better more oil will be discovered and drill. Technology is the next biggest thing, debatable of course.

4220 2018-12-27 16:46:09 The #NASDAC representative of the growth high tech companies is back in the Bear Territories. Energy and Real Estate stocks are badly hit. Oil prices down as the market is oversupplied and the economic outlook is not encouraging.2
4221 2018-12-27 16:46:07 How about this for @EdmontonOilers fans? The Oil went from 4% chance of making the playoffs a year ago to this year to 47% chance which this is a very good number to be if your an Oilers fan because this is a great spot to be in which they are tied for the final wild card spot.

4223 2018-12-27 16:46:02 Agreed, oil needs to stabilize for this market to turn.

4226 2018-12-27 16:45:33 just remember some manufacturers include maintenance with vehicle purchase, recommending a larger interval saves them money. With cleaner fuels and better oil it does last longer than 3k miles, but the higher intervals like 10-15k seem to be pushing it
4227 2018-12-27 16:45:28 I need my car washed, the insides vacuumed, and a oil change. 
4228 2018-12-27 16:45:23 I find your analysis succinct and measured.

The Middle East is indeed a tragedy, further compounded by the discovery of oil me thinks.

4232 2018-12-27 16:44:51 Thoughts on Michael Pachter's own prediction on the next gen Xbox and PlayStation assumptions being 240 FPS? Sounds more like Snake Oil to spread hype. Most PS4 games aren't near 60 FPS and Xbox One games only become 60 FPS on Xbox One X by a developer decision not automatically.

4234 2018-12-27 16:44:32 @IanSt_John I have 2 questions for you,if you cant be honest then maybe your politics need a rethink.
1) Would scots be better off with 100% of oil revenues or the 8% we get?

2) Do you think scots are wrong to want to run their own country?
I look forward to yer replies.

4236 2018-12-27 16:44:27 Oh next your are going to tell us they aren't responsible for the price of oil, the US shale boom, and oil industry job losses in Alberta too. LULZ.
4237 2018-12-27 16:44:27 Exactly my view.  I don't understand the incentive of commenters, like @PragerU, to present the case as if technology stands still.  This is the same trap people fell into when they predicted peak oil.  No one took into account improved extraction tech.

Why do we have leaders that feel nothing for the people. Try to see the BBC Brit episode on Nigerians living in London and weep

4337 2018-12-27 16:34:14 Olive oil and that's about it for olives
4338 2018-12-27 16:34:06 I've thought about that too.  Israel is the key.  Something will happen that will change that and quickly. I couldn't believe when Trump got the US out of Syria.  The US and Saudis won't be involved. I believe the booty or hooks in Jaws are the oil and gas and perhaps technology

4340 2018-12-27 16:34:04 I think the problem with the ‘Its Alberta’s wealth’ idea is it’s in the ground - of the country.Albertans don’t make it.  Does it belong to Alberta? Canada? Indigenous? Regardless we need to move away from economy based on oil.  Imho.
4341 2018-12-27 16:33:59 The same Trump that is taking credit for the bust in oil prices and is responsible for increased costs in manufacturing?

4343 2018-12-27 16:33:34 Do you think the West extracts oil for fun? That car you drive and that plane you flew on and the thousands of products people use on the daily.... don’t throw stones when you live in a glass house. Look yourself in the mirror before you call an industry a planet killer.
4344 2018-12-27 16:33:30 If you read the promotional documentation, the oil change places seem inclined to argue that nearly everywhere should be operating using the "harsh weather" guidelines in the owner's manual. I have not checked for a manufacturer's take on this statement.
4345 2018-12-27 16:33:28 All this while sitting atop the largest proven oil reserves in the world.

4350 2018-12-27 16:32:30 Good, we both agree that at some point, we'll run out of oil right? In your opinion, what do you think will be one the next biggest commodity?

Oil needs to really understand their true value.
The time to end the Bush agenda has come.
4352 2018-12-27 16:32:24 It is not surprising at all. Since oil crisis in 1970s the UN is in the "fist" of the OPEC (mostly muslim countries) lobby. Energy is very good comodity for blackmailing countries that depend on it to vote for it's agendas.
4353 2018-12-27 16:32:19 I think we have male versions of the female instagram models. Men with rented luxury cars, hired whores and pics of stacks of doh. Peddling the Alfa lifestyle. These snake oil sales men are making money off insecure little boys in men's bodies.

4375 2018-12-27 16:30:12 There are environmental concerns with some variants of vegetarian food but that doesn’t mean that the entire premise of not eating meat is flawed. Meat eaters eat both red meat, which is detrimental to the environment, and palm oil products. It’s okay to just cut back on some.
4376 2018-12-27 16:29:55 My mama asked me what i wanted for Christmas. I said a oil change and new breaks..and guess what i woke up to?
4377 2018-12-27 16:29:44 I agree that the reliance on oil is not just an Alberta thing, but the decision to give tax cuts rather than save/invest is an Alberta thing.
4378 2018-12-27 16:29:41 I have a different view on a flag carrier. 

It serves as a private pipeline. Think of it as a dedicated oil pipeline. You may not need it today, but look what it did for an apartheid state. It helped them get supplies. You never know when you’ll need it next...#SAA295

There is oil prospecting going on on the lake Chad basin? Right?
How come the engineers are not being kidnapped?
I thought there is strong BH presence in that area?
Could it be that there is actually oil there? If so, I wonder what is going on
4382 2018-12-27 16:29:14 So if it were a choice between say Beto O'Rourke, and Bernie Sanders you'd vote for Beto simply because Bernie is not registered as a Dem? Even though Beto is funded by big oil, and would not bring the positive change this country needs?
4383 2018-12-27 16:28:59 Wow! Are you sure this would produce the same result for oil spill??
4384 2018-12-27 16:28:45 Need to adult and go get an oil change but I have my period and my couch is too comfy
4385 2018-12-27 16:28:45 and yet the ratio of taken and return has remained the same ever since , plus theres oil and stealth taxes in port subsidy in the South East of England by Scottish Exporters.
4386 2018-12-27 16:28:27 I need a hot oil treatment and a lil trim
4387 2018-12-27 16:28:21 The guy is a big oil darling and is a deregulator. The guy won’t become president.
4388 2018-12-27 16:28:01 Warm it up, strain it, keep it in a mug in the fridge. Next time you’re sautéing veggies: add some bacon fat. Pancakes need oil: bacon fat. Cooking rice? Start with a quick turn in bacon fat. Searing steaks? Bacon fat. Anywhere you’d usually use oil, think about substituion.

4392 2018-12-27 16:27:41 You have a fundamental misunderstanding of crude pricing. You might have a valid point, but your employment of "snake oil", as a premise in arguing this for point, is untenable, as it is entirely lacking in fact.
4393 2018-12-27 16:27:39 This is not a "Retreat" This is a war on our climate future by henchman paid by the corrupt oil and chemical conglomerates, waged relentlessly for years

4398 2018-12-27 16:27:09 I’m sure he knows he promised to put 100,000 middle class Albertans out of work, when the oil crash only cost 35,000 jobs...
4399 2018-12-27 16:27:09 Only if Canadians step up and finally decide to pay all-in costs of using natural resources (oil, metals, water, gas) will innovation happen, our carbon footprint get smaller, and our waters get cleaner.  That’s my wish for 2019 - basically that we stop being so selfish.
4400 2018-12-27 16:27:08 My car tells me when it wants an oil change. I just throw away the stickers from the oil change places.
4401 2018-12-27 16:27:05 Last night at work someone asked me if they could get the oil and “that black stuff” with their bread hahaha

4403 2018-12-27 16:26:46 It's why I choose my own oil and usually do a change every 8k-10k miles driven.

4406 2018-12-27 16:26:39 The fund was started before the NEP. The plan that ripped Alberta's ability to benefit form our oil. Now that the NEP is gone we are stuck with EQ. We don't want your sympathy. We want your hands out of our pockets. Could you imagine the Auto industry be treated this way?
4407 2018-12-27 16:26:31 Are you proud to have been played by the oil and gas industries? Are you getting paid for this stupidity or are you just that gullible?

4433 2018-12-27 16:23:20 No it doesn't. It means there's a lot more oil available now that the US is back in the game. It also means the Mid East knows it's got competition.

4438 2018-12-27 16:22:52 still chuckling to myself abt our family Christmas meal where several older relatives just discovered CBD oil and wanted everyone to know it heals cancer, tendonitis, seizures, “ANYTHING that ails the human body!”

“Our interests” = oil

4442 2018-12-27 16:22:32 Water and oil get it out pretty well
4443 2018-12-27 16:22:26 Any by the way, I agree re pipelines. If you are going to live in a world fueled by gas and oil (and that is increasingly becoming an if) then safe/properly permitted/well maintained pipelines are needed. You can't complain about flaring but then fight all pipelines.
4444 2018-12-27 16:22:19 Cryptocurrencies are a lot like sustainable energy. We have good technology, but their adoption is hindered by incumbents (e.g. big oil, central banks)

4448 2018-12-27 16:22:04 Whether you like it or not the government has always had huge influence on the auto sector. So I guess it is okay for the government to give $3.3 billion in subsidies to oil and gas though?
4449 2018-12-27 16:21:59 Norway needs the oil fund to last centuries so it only spends <4%pa.
The fund started in 1996 to pay for future pensions because it runs a non oil deficit of 7.9% (around half of ours) and took out nothing until 2016 when it took 3.8% out. It was 2.9% in 2017 and 2.7% this year.
4450 2018-12-27 16:21:54 Clearly not. Typical unrealistic comment. Should the Queen speak to the Nation from a bare room? Or maybe sell all the Treasures of which she is current guardian to a few oligarchs or oil rich fellas? Get a grip At 92 she is still hardworking

4466 2018-12-27 16:20:29 i think with oil as long as you keep it under the liquid count and in your carry on they probably won't say anything, not that any of us encourage you to break the rules of course, just what others have done ;) but of course i would not try international with this!
4467 2018-12-27 16:20:24 No. The oil has all the mind-altering stuff removed. It can be very helpful.
4468 2018-12-27 16:20:16 Valvoline told me to stay in the car during the oil change, proving how fast it is or whatever, and it is the most awkward thing. Also, it's been a half hour & at this point I'd rather be in a waiting room watching The View

4473 2018-12-27 16:19:46 I don't need any crude oil, but thank you for the offer.
4474 2018-12-27 16:19:43 apparently

oil pastels require THEIR OWN SPECIFIC PAPER... And it's expensive...
4475 2018-12-27 16:19:35 Kind of reminds you of what Venezuela and the oil. Looks easy when you’re looking from the peanut gallery
4476 2018-12-27 16:19:22 Oil is plentiful. Jobs are plentiful. And the media is talking about recession.
4477 2018-12-27 16:19:13 @CharlesTrippy @AllieWes Was wondering if you could tell me what CBD oil you give your dogs. I know you've mentioned it before but I forget. I have a dachshund with back problems and I think it would really help her. Please and thank you!!!
4478 2018-12-27 16:19:08 no McDonald’s is gross, if u do than think about all the three yr old oil you’re probably consuming as you’re eating it :)
4479 2018-12-27 16:19:07 Aku jg bingung sih. Aku sndri seringnya dibiarin dan jthnya srng kusam krn kotoran nmpel bgt. Kl lg luang cumuk pas siang tp langsung pk face oil/pelembab lg. Tp kalo lg ribet pk tisu ditap2 di T zone. Ada yg blng gpp pk face paper tp jgn smp kering cm susah krn lngsng nyerep :(
4480 2018-12-27 16:19:05 Car manufacturers recommend oil changes today at 5k, 8k, and 10k intervals. I don't think anyone recommends 3k anymore. Why then are oil change places it's telling people that the manufacturer still recommends 3k miles? The seems a lot like fraud...
4481 2018-12-27 16:19:01 It’s a two stroke... make sure you got that oil mixture just right.

4484 2018-12-27 16:18:48 For swords: oil and fine sandpaper do the trick. It's just a matter of knowing the correct grit to match the polish the blade had before.
4485 2018-12-27 16:18:40 I need a oil change 
4486 2018-12-27 16:18:36 This makes me want to oil up some otters and try to catch them.
4487 2018-12-27 16:18:35 Venezuela ranks number 1 in oil reserves. 

Yet they are starving due to their socialism.

4492 2018-12-27 16:18:00 Someone just made +27.10% on WCX: sell WTI Crude Oil 45.236 → 44.623 (20x leverage)  ~ WICKED $WTICO $USD
4493 2018-12-27 16:17:52 Suspicion against Muslims has always been there ever since we went over there and plundered their oil. It fits well with narrative. Prevent program is biased also. Been there and listened to them.
4494 2018-12-27 16:17:47 Lets see if #Oil behaves today to help calm the markets down  , need a close above $45 , $USO , $UWT , $DWT .
4495 2018-12-27 16:17:39 The market can’t go up without oil IMO.
4496 2018-12-27 16:17:36 In its own way, certainly.  I grew up on the southernmost reach of the Great Plains where they morph into the Texas Hill Country and I find myself constantly yearning for great wide open spaces: I’m working now in the oil fields of W Oklahoma and it’s far better than an office.
4497 2018-12-27 16:17:31 Don't forget the plethora of plastic based products, derived from the prospecting, extraction, transportation & refining of OIL.
4498 2018-12-27 16:17:25 @realDonaldTrump You keep repeating "alterative facts" to convince yourself of this, or do you hope to sell the "snake oil" to sell unsuspecting customers the "poisonous concoctions" to make a buck? Sell your "Snake Oils" to those unsuspecting will stop, so be "Truthful,honest"
4499 2018-12-27 16:17:23 Many of the finest books & most important documents were printed on paper matting composed of hemp pulp & bound with hemp fiber fabric.

4510 2018-12-27 16:16:29 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?
4511 2018-12-27 16:16:27 I saw some growth when I used it but I would def recommend aloe Vera juice & black castor oil as safer alternatives
4512 2018-12-27 16:16:21 I need an oil change baddd

4514 2018-12-27 16:16:12 any other country worth its salt, with the billions generated from oil sales, would have developed their own weaponry, planes, bombs, nukes, submarines, even basic technology like medial equipment. But oh no... lazy bastards are too bust in spending it on whores and drink.
4515 2018-12-27 16:16:01 @JRubinBlogger  So for the 100,000 employees that work in the coal and the oil patch you want them to give up their very good paying jobs  for min wage jobs building solar panel and wind mills and lose  a $1 trillion a year from the economy .How does that make a economy grow ?
4516 2018-12-27 16:15:42 Beautiful cotton fields, oil rigs, cattle, and ah yes the confederate flag waving proudly! I love Texas 
4517 2018-12-27 16:15:42 Nope literally a deep fryer where you put oil in instead
4518 2018-12-27 16:15:42 Go to get my oil changed and they come back and tell me and million things that needs to be fixed 
4519 2018-12-27 16:15:29 It's an entitlement. You're putting money in for a later return unlike EI you eventually see a return. EI is insurance in case you're laid off. I've paid both for 13 years at the same company unlike the oil and gas industry I don't get laid off.
4520 2018-12-27 16:15:28 Sana oil
4521 2018-12-27 16:15:18 Lol you don't pay attention to anything besides the RW tweeters, eh John?
1- Prices were down LAST winter too.  And the winter before and before and before.  This is called DEMAND.
2- Oil prices are down because there is an increasing lack of demand.
But you won't listen to this
4522 2018-12-27 16:15:16 I thought of @CharleyCasserly too. Would move no needle at all with fans. What a joke this franchise has become. Snake oil salesmen

4525 2018-12-27 16:15:05 Why an oil change cost me $70??
4526 2018-12-27 16:14:56 the 16yrs mess made us no.1 economy in Africa, opened more than 10 fed-uni, ideas like TSA, BVN, diversifying the economy from oil were all initiated by the PDP govt. 4yrs is enough time for this government to continue the gud work set before them. Buharists are jes delusional..

4531 2018-12-27 16:14:44 The supply and availability of food, water, forests, oil and metals is all up - and increasing - and has been literally every day of your life. Which resources are you talking about?
4532 2018-12-27 16:14:42 Don't you think the price of oil has something to do with   price of gas? I guess you don't watch the news unless is done by your staff.

4564 2018-12-27 16:11:26 I can understand that logic completely, watching oil and that cud make or break it. For me the short kinda felt right, am rubbish at explaining my trades, lets just see
4565 2018-12-27 16:11:22 Still better than the songs the Oil Kings used to play after getting scored on. I don’t even remember all the songs until I hear them on the radio & the bad memories come back. 
4566 2018-12-27 16:11:10 I swear. But what he doesn’t seem to understand is science has moved away from oil dependent alternatives. Not in oil producing states of course but in other countries they don’t like being dependent on our oil
The money he is talking about is being pumped into other alternatives
4567 2018-12-27 16:11:05 @agitpapa Ex-ISIS fighters also in SDF? Some fighters from Arab tribes near oil fields, i guess.
4568 2018-12-27 16:11:04 Unfortunately oil will be a thing until the old ways die out. I have come to terms with that....as for the pipeline. If it makes us less dependent from America and brings in more money while slow down isn’t that a good thing?

4578 2018-12-27 16:10:14 @JRubinBlogger  You people don't believe in due process of law .You want to convict a person just because  someone said the person did something with out  proof .That's like the Nazis . You want to give voting rights back to felons . You want to  ban oil , gas , coal .
4579 2018-12-27 16:10:12 Give this man some CBD oil 
4580 2018-12-27 16:10:06 Let us know when the GOP votes to invest in renewable energy, a modern electrical grid & demands a changeover to electric vehicles & maybe Beto will then be able to vote for something different that will keep his constituents, who depend on the oil industry, employed.
4581 2018-12-27 16:10:05 Deeply regret voting for Obama who ran on Anti War platform but spread wars across Middle East instead, approved oil drilling in Arctic, Atlantic coast, and gave billions to Iran, zero to poor black communities, but media is paid to praise them as saints.

4605 2018-12-27 16:07:55 The perceived slow down in Automotives will likely impact the entire supply chain including the paint companies. 

Oil correction helped them on the input front but do watch the demand side equation as well.

4613 2018-12-27 16:07:15 2 months back : Oil at 85. World will slow down.

Now : Oil at 50. World will slow down.



Avoid media noise. Focus on fundamentals of companies.
4614 2018-12-27 16:07:14 And unfortunately science is moving green energy and the like forward. What do you think will happen to Oil dependent countries when their major customers stop buying as much. It’s very real, so many countries have already signed the accord to go green. 2 decades is all they need

4622 2018-12-27 16:06:30 I'm enjoying the low gas prices. Read somewhere they say oil will go up to 60 to 80 a barrel. So the energy experts say. Only if China's economy continues to expand. Apple is going to make high end IPhone's in India now.
4623 2018-12-27 16:06:24 It's been 1,000 days since the BP oil spill and the Gulf of Mexico still has not been restored.

4633 2018-12-27 16:05:53 Consumption for oil is as big as its ever been and is not expected to decline for decades. Canadian energy has a political war waged against it, but energy is not in decline.

4645 2018-12-27 16:04:57 Sorry Canadian children. Your parents voted for climate denying/indifferent, oil lobbyists for too many years. Now we must vote for them again, lest we confront the appropriate urgency and action required of us.

4648 2018-12-27 16:04:41 Actually,  no one in eastern Canada can refine more than they are now, if they are already refining AB product.  It was all supposed to be shipped to the US but they don't need as much anymore due to increase in shale oil. Like TC said, the project is no longer economic.

4681 2018-12-27 16:02:01 You also got about $0.30 (fluxuates year to year, $0.12 to $0.50) that comes not from any state benefit, but from California's gas stations being more tightly in bed with oil refineries, who have higher control of prices. Not enough competition there, perhaps.

Regardless, hurts.

4684 2018-12-27 16:01:41 I don't either....  it just seems these days there are always sides when talking about Politics(USA), and Canadian Oil Industry.

I don't like the "Us v Them" attitude at all.  It's not what I ever though Canada would become :(
4685 2018-12-27 16:01:40 Does hemp oil help? I’m not certain what condition you are talking about but I’ve been hearing amazing stirs about oil.

4711 2018-12-27 15:58:19 We have had instances where the oil seed actually reacts with the belt material. The more common issue is the canola getting behind the belt and gumming up the transition points and rollers.
4712 2018-12-27 15:58:18 It's the aggregate of those donations that are suspicious. Big oil Texas just dumped millions of dollars into my state to defeat a carbon tax.  That's exactly why you are required to list WHO you work for. To expose concerted efforts.

4728 2018-12-27 15:57:01 Put it in a sealed jar in your fridge then use it on your cast iron. Mt grill grates and pan are cast and it is good for frying on the pan and seasoning the grate/pan after use and brushing while the grill is still warm. It runs everywhere, unlike veg oil.

4734 2018-12-27 15:56:41 1/ I get that you don’t like oil. Do you know how much Alberta has given to other provinces over the decades? It’s more than 12 billion. Also it isn’t up to just Alberta to diversify its up to Canada to diversify. Provinces are happy to take oil money when Alberta is booming but
4735 2018-12-27 15:56:38 Everyone using the misleading Sirota points about beto being in bed with big oil are bots? The Kamala is a cop folks? The Kirsten fired Franken folks? The DNC rigged the election folks? And now the Obama wa a bad president folks? Funny how all those bots support one person.
4736 2018-12-27 15:56:28 Yeah it’s seems like it’s a “logical” conclusion to believe a couple of high end republican congressmen and billionaire oil executives vs ... you know... actual scientists... smh
4737 2018-12-27 15:56:19 Minford taught at L'pool Univ. At that time in economics they were telling us that no Chancellor could survive unemployment above a million and that N Sea oil would turn Scotland into a European Gulf State. A man of great judgement.

4739 2018-12-27 15:56:16 How can weed have e.coli?

Couple things: e.coli is a bacteria. It requires moisture. Weed is dried.

Also, you smoke weed, you don’t eat it (unless you make it into an edible using butter or oil), and burning e.coli tends to kill it.
4740 2018-12-27 15:56:14 I invest for the long term heid, I certainly don’t jump in when #chris oil says so lol
4741 2018-12-27 15:56:00 Sounds like you're brainwashed by the oil companies. If it suits your lifestyle, an EV is much nicer to drive than a dino engine car and much cheaper to run with very little to service or to go wrong - and full of fuel every morning. No gears, oil, chains, exhaust, & brakes 200k+

4753 2018-12-27 15:55:06 It's been real long before we had oil in out cars. it could still get worse but, it's the man made argument that is made up. Watch the documentary, rely less on mainstream media.
4754 2018-12-27 15:55:06 That's a strong GOP ticket.  White, male, rural, protectionist, and oil friendly.

4757 2018-12-27 15:54:43 I disagree about the layman comment. But it seems you don’t get what I mean. And it’s true we should produce our best product more efficiently. But also improve our other sectors. We’re too dependent on oil. Diversifying doesn’t necessarily mean the oil sector will be forgotten.

4782 2018-12-27 15:51:56 That is the 2nd dumbest thing you said this week! You of all people, Premier Drug Fraud, should know that oil prices are low because there is a surplus. Where did you get your education? In a crack house?
4783 2018-12-27 15:51:55 A $10.00 tax per barrel of oil, open borders, drug legalization, gun bans and calling cops "the new Jim Crow" to a black audience sounds an awful lot like a progressive to me.

4801 2018-12-27 15:50:51 I was using this peppermint oil which helped me breathe better but I lost it. I’ve also heard lavender oil works too.
4802 2018-12-27 15:50:43 Fool can you explain historically why & how we became “suckers of the world “ before you became con artist of the world and we now literally face that title by election of a snake oil salesman

- use heat protectant on your hair before using heat!
- use Vaseline and castor oil on your lips

4811 2018-12-27 15:49:44 They went up locally here (Aurora, On) 5cents/litre a week ago. @fordnation if you have such complete control of oil/gas prices why did you not own up to the responsibility of that increase? #onpoli

4815 2018-12-27 15:49:29 The idea of diverting from oil is a layman argumen. Though am not totally sure wht u mean by that. Economically, why would u stop producing ur best product? We have a compative advantage on it over 100 or less countries. Wht u should say is that we should be more efficient at it.
4816 2018-12-27 15:49:27 Move if you can to help keep blood moving. A bit of Peppermint oil or tea helps. Stretching can help too or yoga positions like warrior 1 & 2

4825 2018-12-27 15:48:00 You dismiss the intelligence community's conclusion that Putin interfered in our election. That alone disqualifies you from having a valid opinion. Then you chide Tony Schwartz, whose book Trump promoted as true. Now you cannot fathom that Mark Burnett is a snake oil salesman.
4826 2018-12-27 15:47:58 People who follow the ups and downs of crude oil prices are accustomed to terms like Brent and WTI. 

Let's hold a discussion tonight fellas.

What is the difference between Brent and WTI? 

Let's learn something new before the year ends. Floor is yours.

4831 2018-12-27 15:47:44 Not to divert you guys from your main discussion...the move away from oil is engineered by the West. This is to reduce the east financial muscle(Russia , Syria,Iran, Iraq, etc). It's political more than scientific. Watch on YouTube doc - Global warming swindle.

4833 2018-12-27 15:47:38 Sadly, they're closing them prematurely and burning more coal, oil and gas to replace the electricity. But even with renewable and nuclear energy, trains should simply be electric. Many are already. No new tech needed.

4837 2018-12-27 15:47:20 The neoliberal ideal is a completely nomadic & rootless workforce, without ties to land or community, eternally chasing jobs with lower benefits from place to place, from call center jobs in Georgia to oil sector jobs in North Dakota. Hence the global rebellions of the rural poor

4844 2018-12-27 15:46:39 Partially hydrogenated vegetable oils is less often in foods due to health concerns. So #palmoil has been a preferred replacement oil for food manufacturers as unlike most vegetable oils, it is a solid at room temperature. This is due to the high degree of saturation of palm oil

4852 2018-12-27 15:46:12 You go add dry pepper put inside the palm oil?

4864 2018-12-27 15:44:54 How much is oil price in the markets today?  I guess the pipeline would turn out to be a bad idea as of today.
4865 2018-12-27 15:44:51 It would rain on the day I gotta go get an oil change

4867 2018-12-27 15:44:42 And yes Obama did increase American oil production, but that would reduce the price not increase it. Oil prices are still at a historically low price. That’s a good thing I’m not the biggest fan of fossil fuels.

4871 2018-12-27 15:44:08 Again there are theories that science and technology have a key, people have been forecasting oil will run out for decades, but due to new discoveries and more efficient use it has not. Not a long term solution but? Again we pollute less in many ways now.
4872 2018-12-27 15:44:04 I’m mad worried about scars I just ordered something someone else recommended, but do you use tea tree oil directly on your face or get it in a wash or something ?
4873 2018-12-27 15:44:04 They have a lot of natural gas. Which feeds %85 of europe. Not only oil.
4874 2018-12-27 15:43:59 When did "they" say we were going to die from cooling, and who are "they?"

More importantly, how is it possible that you think that climate scientists have more motivation to lie about climate change than fucking oil executives and the politicians they support?
4875 2018-12-27 15:43:58 I scheduled an oil change at 7:30 am tomorrow. I’m mad now lol
4876 2018-12-27 15:43:44 just another tea leaves reader selling snake oil to gullible "traders" (aka suckers).  he really knows very little about the fundamentals of Bitcoin. ex: he didn't know users have to maintain a full node online to use LN despite shilling it for months as the best thing ever

4879 2018-12-27 15:43:27 No Brexiteer is not keeping me busy. Most middlemsized firms, my clients, have no idea not wish to export outside the EU. The Redwood/Davies argument that non EU countries were growing faster was true until the oil price fell but 2x almost nothing is still almost nothing.
4880 2018-12-27 15:43:26 Someone’s idiosyncrasies of ignorance isn’t an excuse for another to also dabble into the ignorance. Two wrongs most definitely do not make a right!

4885 2018-12-27 15:43:05 The flaxseed oil was not for weight loss, but intellectual function.
4886 2018-12-27 15:43:03 Well this is the same guy who wanted to take their oil for spoils of war.
4887 2018-12-27 15:43:01 My face has been clearing up a lot lately. Dove soap & coconut oil, das it.
4888 2018-12-27 15:42:58 Ya . But we use patanjali Kesh kanti and coconut oil.
4889 2018-12-27 15:42:41 Well, firstly to give anyone credit for the oil boom is ridiculous. Obama and trump literally did nothing. Secondly I don’t like Terrance because he’s annoying (subjective yes).
4890 2018-12-27 15:42:41 Anyone who supports sharia law, like L Sarsour, should be shunned by Western society. They are NOT warriors for justice. They are hucksters, selling poisonous snake oil.

4896 2018-12-27 15:41:54 Canada has a diverse economy. We have been leading the g7 in most economic indicators despite years of low oil prices.
4897 2018-12-27 15:41:47 Alberta under 40 years of PC govts also failed to get tough with the oil companies as Norway did - it was all good times with high rolling PC cronies
4898 2018-12-27 15:41:45 Like Rockefeller's Standard Oil, FEDECAMARAS needs to broken up.  They have a monopoly that is too dangerous for the Venezuelan people.
4899 2018-12-27 15:41:45 Sure. Hit me up when you’re able to make oil that doesn’t make our planet warmer.

4905 2018-12-27 15:41:21 Tighten the sanctions noose by interdicting oil smuggling. Punish third country sanction violators. Do not remove nuke umbrella. Collapse Nork caves under SK soil.
4906 2018-12-27 15:41:20 You can’t eliminate oil/gas overnight. It will have to be gradual. Just like the cannabis issue. The people with the money who control the world need to figure out how they can benefit from it monetarily. THEN change will start happening exponentially.
4907 2018-12-27 15:41:18 I hate lotion period but that one has too much oil for me. I use jergens and mix it with water. Works for me.

4918 2018-12-27 15:40:21 This is not correct. In fact the oil royalties are in line with other producers. The difference is we get more based on the selling price of our oil. Since we only have 1 customer they dictate our price.

4926 2018-12-27 15:40:01 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

4928 2018-12-27 15:39:49 Everyone has a hot button. For some, it's the border situation. For others, it's shooting hibernating bears. For some, it's putting oil pipelines through sacred grounds. For others, it's mocking a child's belief in Santa Claus. There's more than enough to go around.

4931 2018-12-27 15:39:29 Your choices really mean shit. The president only has so much power and the people that own the oil/gas companies have all the resources they need to keep their trains moving.
I’m pretty sure Beto is all about regulating them a bit more and also vying for sustainable options.
4932 2018-12-27 15:39:28 I hate going to the mechanic. They stay trying to upsell women. I just came for an oil change dassit!!

Where the lifts are pulled by magic ponies & solar powered helicopter whisk you away for heli skiing
And at night you stay warm with locally chopped wood
4938 2018-12-27 15:38:48 The problem is that Alberta, and Canada as a whole, put all it's eggs in one basket with the Oil sands. So when oil was doing well, the economy was good. Alberta doesn't have a PST. 

Oil $/B will come back up. But the CPC would rather blame Trudeau.

4940 2018-12-27 15:38:45 Look, am a realist, the "world" has been saying it for over 50 years, can you really point to any tangible green thing u have or can afford. Economically, people like affordability, all I have to do is keep price of oil down and no one will think of green energy, it is game.

4950 2018-12-27 15:37:55 You may of dropped the Carbon Tax scam, but prices of gasoline is still high , Compared to the oil Prices.Years ago.Gas prices per litre was the same price as a barrel of oil. EI. 45.00 a barrel/45 cents a litre. Now 43 a barrel and some gas stations are still over a buck.Greed.

4959 2018-12-27 15:36:49 I love hearing people’s explanations for the market going down.  You almost never hear them about the market going up.  

Trump
China
The fed
Oil

You never hear human psychology, fear, noise.  People are sure of their explanations.  Our media continues to report this nonsense.

4966 2018-12-27 15:35:49 There is always room for improvement. Unfortunately, they see more money in oil, and ammo. The utopia that your looking for, will be made with robots. It will happen after, we are forced indoors to breathe. But by that time, the weather will be far more catastrophic.
4967 2018-12-27 15:35:48 Nom! Turkish salad.  Ingredients: olive oil, minced garlic, hot cooked rice, salt, slab bacon, salt, and thinly sliced onion.

4971 2018-12-27 15:35:30 If @realDonaldTrump ever starts a war it would be in defense of U.S. or an ally, not in defense of oil, drugs, or because a leader won’t fall in line of the global world order.
4972 2018-12-27 15:35:29 It’s one thing to sell $gliba when everything it rallying. It’s quite another to sell it again when everything is falling. Alaskans need Internet too! Yes, the move in oil hurts. But we deliver great service at a reasonable price. Plus tracker discounts!!!
4973 2018-12-27 15:35:23 David lied. It's sad that you can't see what he is doing. Beto took money from people who work in the Oil & Gas Industry, not from corporations. David knows this but he spun it to trick you & your bought his lies. It's TX. Where do you think Houston residents are employed?

4978 2018-12-27 15:34:22 I am seriously traumatized by this silly putty. Already I am having flashbacks. And it'll take days to wash out all the coconut oil from her hair, which goes past her bottom. Though her hair now does have that healthy shine to it.
4979 2018-12-27 15:34:18 Every hour, the Orangutan Project estimates, areas equal to 300 football fields are destroyed to make way for palm oil plantations in Southeast Asia. The trade-off for this growth is animals ― e.g. endangered orangutans, elephants & tigers ― rapidly losing their natural habitats

4986 2018-12-27 15:33:24 One attack on Beto focused on donors who work for the oil industry, and intimated that those donations came from oil & gas lobbyists. I noticed that one because a lot of Bernies donors work on Wall Street & the dark money assistance for Bernie comes from Russia.

5017 2018-12-27 15:30:41 Since the Oil/Gas Industry has Oil Depletion Allowance, 15% of Gross Income, how about regular wage earners (otherwise known as VOTERS) get a Depletion Allowance of 15% on Total Wages? After all, we get depleted every time we get used.

5021 2018-12-27 15:30:27 Now #oakvilleaudi tell me that basically an oil change is going to cost me $460.  It took 3 weeks!!! To get this appointment for my #audi Q5.
5022 2018-12-27 15:30:22 No worries. Yes, there is sin all over. The context and omissions in Sirota's reporting on the oil industry donations will still suck ass regardless. This is not about O'Rourke at all. It is simply about journalism.
5023 2018-12-27 15:30:18 Norway is a small population country with a lot of income from gas/oil. Iceland is a small population country with a great tourist industry and they produce all of their energy via hydroelectric and geothermal (except petrol).

5026 2018-12-27 15:29:49 Who do u want Jim Acosta who said they were a couple months away.?  I know and u want to keep our soldiers fighting to protect drug fields  and 32 oil fields of Haliburton.  Its not ur limbs, it’s not ur eyes, hearing or death.
5027 2018-12-27 15:29:47 That's because he's 'in-beto' with big oil companies and the financial services sector.

But then, in modern day football, at least they're doing it without oil money aka City and Chelski. As you mention, plenty of their funds now were from big player sales

- enormous forests of timber.
- fishing rights 2,000 km.
- 53 million people.

5036 2018-12-27 15:28:42 When? He was doing flax oil.  I know he had quality issues when he went to China, so maybe he changed there.  But we had a lady on the boards that just nose-clipped and ate one meal that way.  It is definitely independent of the type of oil.

5053 2018-12-27 15:27:10 Was just thinking that there are some "retail" oil traders wearing bathrobes and socks in their home offices who traded oil better than Sinopec's Unipec traders.  Kind of interesting. #OOTT

5059 2018-12-27 15:26:37 He's from Texas. Duh. He got contributions from people who work in oil & gas. Duh. 50% of the oil & gas jobs in the whole country are in Texas. My guess is if he runs nationally, he will not.
5060 2018-12-27 15:26:34 * Hair

5065 2018-12-27 15:26:19 Thank you Doug for scrapping that BS Liberal carbon tax - I hope the price per litre stays at a fair market price & that OPEC stops manipulating oil production & refinery that also controls the price per barrel. Happy New Year Doug!
5066 2018-12-27 15:26:18 Hirap naman niyan parang mas madali yung motor oil
5067 2018-12-27 15:26:16 You control the global price for a barrel of oil?  that's news to me.  This might be unknown to you, but when the value of oil drops so does the Canadian economy. If we had actual progressives in government we may one day move off of oil,  but today low gas prices is bad #onpoli

5083 2018-12-27 15:25:06 He was misleading from the beginning in how he presented the details of Beto's campaign contributions from the oil industry; that is why he got such a backlash to his "reporting" and why he has become such a deranged whiner
5084 2018-12-27 15:25:05 We need that walk and 2 billion is not enough.  U r most likely wealthyband can afford to pay more taxes for a welfare state.  Also we want our men back from guarding the haliburton 32 oil fields and drug fields.  Let them provide their own security.

How are they allowed to call this "news"? Isn't this exactly why we have an FCC?

5128 2018-12-27 15:20:55 Really? Lowest unemployment, best economy in over 15 yrs, the world's leader in oil exports, or more jobs than people looking doesn't figure into your hate?
5129 2018-12-27 15:20:54 When is the liberal left going to acknowledge that climate change is a natural event on this earth. The climate has never been stable and never will be. The reason they drill for oil in the arctic is that at one time it was a rain forest.

5145 2018-12-27 15:19:42 Cold smoked mine with pecan for about 3 hours then wrapped it & put in the fridge overnight. Did the sous-vide for 6 hours at 135°. Made a paste of olive oil, garlic, Rosemary, & thyme. Applied that then put in a 475° oven for 10 minutes to form the crust. Turned out great.
5146 2018-12-27 15:19:30 Employees of the oil industry (e.g. drivers, rig workers, secretaries) are quite different from PAC money from Exxon Mobil, and the tweet made it look like it was the latter. That's a smear. You choose to perpetuate it by defending the tactic that's your business.

5154 2018-12-27 15:18:14 The US policy as was for South Korea is to starve North Korea, they partially succedded in early 1990s when pupet Boris Yeltsin adhered to the dictat of Seoul and Washington to cut all economic and trade relations, food, oil, fertilizers, medicine, etc...
5155 2018-12-27 15:18:05 Like seriously, Whats up with this $CAD  rout? Just crazy given they have USMCA settled and BOC indicating inflation on track.. $OIL the only doubt but geee. I think we have some major corrections in place for early 2019. #forex #trading $USDcAd

That's why he's second to Ted Cruz on that list...it's fucking Texas.

5163 2018-12-27 15:17:04 How do u expect anyone to accept your voice of correction while being outrightly rude and belligerent? There are profiles on Twitter that serve as constant reminders of Islamic injunctions and teachings, n they do so in the most admirable, commendable way.
5164 2018-12-27 15:17:04 The stats for hours worked & wages earned include single women .It's unclear if those reporting on how much housework they do include singles as well. There's no mention of chores like mowing, unclogging the disposal, changing the car oil, changing air filters, fixing the toilet
5165 2018-12-27 15:17:04 Why would a Tesla require an oil change?
5166 2018-12-27 15:17:00 I would never vote in the next Scottish Parliment elections for Scottish Labour THE Lib-Dem's The Green' of or wee Ruth's numpty Tory party  a free and independant Scotland please oh and UK Gov you owe us 40 years of North Sea oil money that Thatcher the oil snatcher stole
5167 2018-12-27 15:16:50 He'll bring oil back up to $120/BBL don't ya know?!
5168 2018-12-27 15:16:49 Jokes on you. Oil Kings didn’t reform until 2007!
5169 2018-12-27 15:16:34 Am I okay...? I ate 2 eggs (fried in olive oil), 1 orange, salsa, a big 200 calorie tortilla :(, several sips of carbonated fruit punch, water, iced tea w/ lemon juice...am I fat for this...???
5170 2018-12-27 15:16:33 I would suggest to apply Beard Oil first then finishing your routine with any styling product such as Styling Balm or Sea Salt Spray. 
-Randa
5171 2018-12-27 15:16:32 These people have been changing my oil for 2 hours. These boys fucking up my car lmfao
5172 2018-12-27 15:16:25 A50 opened high but ended low today, with a surprise from Sinopec oil trading loss. Was it really a zero collar? No idea. Even if the sentiment was low, IV was landed at 22.7(-0.6 pct). Both A50 and its IV would drop moderately
5173 2018-12-27 15:16:25 Those numbers should have already been revised down. I believe trump admin is artificially trying to keep oil lower
5174 2018-12-27 15:16:22 Beto looks good, sounds good, but LOOK AT HIS VOTING RECORD! VOTED with Trump and Republicans 33% of the time. He supported drilling for oil & gas in national parks. He's NOT a progressive. Don't be fooled!
5175 2018-12-27 15:16:19 #StockMarket Selling into any pop. I think 2450 S&P is resistance at this point. Watching Oil , Dollar, Gold, Bonds. I will have only 10-20% stocks with hedges until I see a bottom.
5176 2018-12-27 15:16:17 Sana oil
5177 2018-12-27 15:16:11 Oil
5178 2018-12-27 15:16:04 Even olive oil on salads.
5179 2018-12-27 15:16:01 Essential Oil
A plant oil which is extracted through a very complex process that generally yields very little product, making it costly to buy true essential oils. It's a misconception to think of them as actually being oily because they rarely are.
5180 2018-12-27 15:15:49 whyyy does it feel like oil changes come back around so fast 
5181 2018-12-27 15:15:48 Palm oil

5187 2018-12-27 15:15:03 I need new tires a oil change and a car wash like today

5190 2018-12-27 15:14:40 I was actually gonna ask if you've been there cuz it says they cook their chicken in peanut oil, but I guess that wouldn't affect you?
5191 2018-12-27 15:14:29 I'm trying to follow this- I don't know if it matter or not, but any food can be used as a Shangri-La diet dose.  Nose-clip and eat chicken breast. Seth originally used sugar water. I went for walnut oil, eventually.

Me: bread and indomie 
5195 2018-12-27 15:14:17 I kinda remember during the first or second gulf war we were supposed to recoup our costs by taking the oil until it was paid for but I don’t believe we did that, did we?
5196 2018-12-27 15:14:08 Hemp oil supposed to do some good they extract all the bad stuff and a little boy was able to control his seizures that's about it but smoking that stinky crap make their brain numb but I never used any of it. I only used vitamins and supplement. I've seen too much I  stayed away
5197 2018-12-27 15:14:01 Sure I’ll grant you he is a centrist type and is trying to appeal to everyone w this. No doubt I would prefer a harder line but I think it’s not fair to say he is advocating for boosting oil and gas here
5198 2018-12-27 15:13:58 So endless foriegn wars for oil. Allow foriegners to kill citizens in the US. Orangemanbad!
5199 2018-12-27 15:13:50 They aren't making mistakes, look at their track record. It's terrible. They caused the great depression and great recession, they had a hand in all the oil crises. The fed is not helping, they're hurting us. Raising interest and printing money at higher rates has one outcome.

Worst than Cuba, Venezuela, etc, still all industrialized countries kneel down when facing them like puppets.

Oh, I forgot! They’re billionaires with oil! Power at its worst
5202 2018-12-27 15:13:17 Most economists are the modern day snake oil salesmen.
5203 2018-12-27 15:13:03 2 months back : Oil at 85. World will slow down.

5206 2018-12-27 15:12:43 I did not listen to his entire speech.  Senate who follow their lobbyists pushing the President into staying. Many of us Americans voted for Trump because we wanted him to pull out of Middle East. Bush Dynasty. Oil. Our border has no troops. Where is that respect?

5208 2018-12-27 15:12:42 As far as I know all brands of conveyors. Good question on the canola oil, @AGIHOPPY780 would be able to answer that one, he is a rep for AGI who owns Batco.

5211 2018-12-27 15:12:23 If oil is dead dinosaurs then our cars are powered by dinosaur juice!
5212 2018-12-27 15:12:12 Musk: We know we'll run out of dead dinosaurs to mine for fuel & have to use sustainable energy eventually so why not go renewable now&avoid increasing risk of climate catastrophe?Betting that science is wrong & oil companies are right is the dumbest experiment in history by far.
5213 2018-12-27 15:12:08 Use corn oil and canola oil 
Mostly plant based
"Mediterranean" which is now also plant based...
DASH
Keto requires supplements...
Don't limit foods (unless it's meat)

Well that was shit

5215 2018-12-27 15:11:57 I never thought his lies were believable! I spotted that snake oil salesman from hundreds of miles away, and many years ago! When someone brags so much about their wealth, I question if they are as wealthy as they claim, and obviously he is not! Now his lies do much more harm!

5219 2018-12-27 15:11:24 Israel had fun bombing Syria while thousands of Christians were trying to worship on Christmas Eve. I think Israel will be fine. As always it’s all about the oil.

5223 2018-12-27 15:10:58 @cvpayne Lov the Oil guys talking their book. Oil is going lower and they don't need 70 - 80 per barrel to make money. If they did they wouldn't be adding rigs, high 30's here we come
5224 2018-12-27 15:10:53 Me: I'm feeling down and stressed and I don't wanna get up to wash my face and skincare.

Also me: Bitch, you spent almost two grand on an oil cleanser alone.

Okay inner monologue, I'm going already!

5230 2018-12-27 15:09:49 @Varneyco oil went down to $33 under Obama
5231 2018-12-27 15:09:45 Considering the support he gets from big oil, it seems to be a pretty safe assumption, if David were to make it.
5232 2018-12-27 15:09:32 I came for an oil change at 7:45. Why am I still here? Toyota on that bs this morning
5233 2018-12-27 15:09:28 Baba Yaga was chasing her, but she heard all about it, but she poured oil on the towel.
5234 2018-12-27 15:09:21 Sugar, not oil.  Unless you're talking about deep frying in which case that goes hand in hand with high carb foods.

5236 2018-12-27 15:09:14 When the change from leaded to unleaded gas happened; the oil companies uped the price for NOT adding something.  Their costs went down and they raised the price - does that make any kind of sense to you?
5237 2018-12-27 15:09:14 The irony being that an oil baron started one of the big anti-nuclear groups
5238 2018-12-27 15:09:02 Horses helped build our nation, and we used to use whale oil to light our homes, and spears to protect ourselves, but we moved past those things when new technology became available. This is that moment in time for fossil fuels. Evolve.

5244 2018-12-27 15:08:08 Crude futures are holding up. IMO this would be very positive to see oil continue higher or at least base (stop falling like a rock)

5253 2018-12-27 15:06:55 Cautiously optimistic about this price action - weaker dollar, rates rallying, oil holding yesterday gains well. Weaker dollar key to less pain in equity markets imo.
5254 2018-12-27 15:06:44 While they are at the oil and coal, they should look at the Gore family close connections to the Love Canal Superfund pollution & connections to the Soviet Union through Occidental Petroleum & Armand Hammer, son of a founder of the Communist Party USA.
5255 2018-12-27 15:06:28 Under Lisa Rait's Conservative plan we can just convert the oil to hockey pucks and if spilled use our curling brooms to sweep it under the perma frost.
5256 2018-12-27 15:06:20 Likewise - they are positioned well with exposure to both drills and decent £1.3 mill cash post drills 

Not often you get a back to back drill opportunity like this 

Great to see #AAOG report oil shows too - the market needed that and let’s hope that’s the way to go for 2019

5271 2018-12-27 15:04:57 If you really don’t realize that the need for oil is dwindling nor the fact that US & China are working so much towards using less fossil fuels & reducing carbon footprint then I really don’t know what to say. There’s a reason why the oil market is so much more volatile right now
5272 2018-12-27 15:04:42 Mr. Lecce, do you really think the residents of Ontario are so simple that they believe that @fordnation controls the price of oil? This price is the result of a worldwide over supply of oil, something no Ontario Government controls, and you are aware of that already!
5273 2018-12-27 15:04:24 I do not think they can, it depends on too many factors. Yet pouring tons of CO2 into the atmosphere does not seem a very sensible long term policy and has some pretty likely outcome on the absorbed radiation... Does working near oil and gas wells produce cognitive dissonance?
5274 2018-12-27 15:04:22 Hope they don't get as evil as China gobbling up the world. Look what they're doing to Myanmar.  Destroying villages for oil prosperity
5275 2018-12-27 15:04:10 Bacon is a good call. However, if you use pancetta instead you’ll be amazed how much better it all tastes. Cut the pancetta into nice size pieces, then cook the pancetta, set it aside, & then use the oil to soften the Brussels sprouts. Then toss the pancetta back in to warm up.
5276 2018-12-27 15:04:08 That's the same kind of stupid thay wishes there was no oil.

Are we investing in #EVs or battery materials? Why not get @apaulgill on @DisruptorsBNN to discuss the future?

5280 2018-12-27 15:03:47 Far fewer parts to worry about in a Tesla. It’s a major reason why many in auto business (dealers & repairs) are throwing fits &constantly attacking Tesla. They’re upset they won’t get my money to replace sensors, belts, oil/gas, spark plugs, fuses, alternators, mufflers, etc.
5281 2018-12-27 15:03:47 Oil is below $50/bbl and we are about to start exporting LNG to the EU. These are nails in Russians economic coffin.
5282 2018-12-27 15:03:28 First off, I wonder if you knew about the word klepto before just recently. Secondly, what's your opinion on the government still charging petrol at the same price when oil prices have gone down. Isn't that stealing as well? Hypocrisy, or just plain stupidity?
5283 2018-12-27 15:03:19 How is population relevant here? By that logic contribution of population of oil producing nations becomes like Saudi and Norway becomes minimal.India on the other hand is a consumption based economy, only 25% of GDP is foreign trade.Out of this 60% is oil and electronics import.
5284 2018-12-27 15:03:13 Not quite right. We are joined together by list for the proceeds of oil, not fear. The pervasive unease is because we refuse the truth- unity in diversity, self determination, justice, equity and fairness, bedrocks of an egalitarian society!
We reject truth, and live a lie!
5285 2018-12-27 15:03:11 This is me but with canadian hemp oil capsules which have less than .0001% thc buy some today you wont be sorry grandpa

5287 2018-12-27 15:02:52 I changed my diet enough to become an outlier in the weight loss statistics world. I've tried using things like sweet potatoes- hunger ramps up over the course of days.  It be interesting if the coconut oil balances that by being an appetite suppressant.
5288 2018-12-27 15:02:45 Would have to see reversal in oil and European weakness. Dax continues to look frightening.

5290 2018-12-27 15:02:27 We will put Trump back in for 2020 by giving the Democrats the most awful choices possible, so we can smoke out the squeakiest wheels and not give them any oil. We will create a chorus of squeaks instead.
5291 2018-12-27 15:01:51 I’m waiting to get my oil changed and this baby girl was crying to her mother bc she wanted some candy. But her mother didn’t have anymore change on her. So, I kindly gave the little girl a coin. #KindGesture

5294 2018-12-27 15:01:24 These mf'ers PROMISED that peppermint oil would keep spiders away. Did that stop a herculean spider from pole dancing on a bottle of peppermint oil in my cabinet? Nope.

I had to scream in horror, grab the bottle, and smash the arthropod into oblivion before it could kill me.
5295 2018-12-27 15:01:23 This is 2018. Certainly there is better technology for border security than a wall. Are enforcement officials supposed to stand atop it An pour boiling oil down on illegals like in the Middle Ages?  Haven’t we progressed more than that as a people?
5296 2018-12-27 15:01:18 Oils! Any of the essential oils... coconut oil, shear butter oil, tea tree oil... etc

5301 2018-12-27 15:01:05 Black Tea with coconut oil. Cinnamon and vanilla are nice too. Stay away from alcohol if you can. Unfair that a tiny ounce of delicious soothing liquid has all of those bad calories.
5302 2018-12-27 15:00:46 When the meat is done, remove from pan, leaving the oil, juices, and any spices you may have added.

Throw in a generous portion of fresh of frozen veggies. Maybe add a little water if needed.
5303 2018-12-27 15:00:43 Yeah but subsidies with taxpayers money for oil and gas companies is not socialism?

5317 2018-12-27 14:59:51 Tips

-Depending on your skin type, serums can be helpful. Small amounts of tea tree oil help dry pimples and reduce their appearance.
-Exercising helps increase blood circulation which sends more oxygen to your skin cells & carries cell waste away + you get a hot bod.
5318 2018-12-27 14:59:50 I mean why do you think the whole country went into recession when oil prices crashed between 2015-2016 on the global market. If it’s isn’t because of the country’s over-dependence on crude oil, then I don’t know what caused it nor how we were able to come out of it so quickly.

You think Canada, 0.49% of the global population, is the straw that stirs the drink?  

We can commit economic suicide switching to renewables tomorrow and the other 99.51% of the world will continue consuming oil, displacing what we made with their own.

5332 2018-12-27 14:58:19 And of course speaking in wonder of the fact that his donations from those workers are second highest nationally is rube-like. O'Rourke led worker donations nationally in 40 fucking industries, but lost the title in oil to Cruz. Oh.
5333 2018-12-27 14:58:13 Simple technique that worked for me:

Start with a package of ramen noodles (don’t laugh).

Choose a protein that matches the ramen flavor: chicken, beef, shrimp, etc.

Pan fry the meat in a little olive oil, using a few pinches of the ramen seasoning for flavor.

5338 2018-12-27 14:57:40 Agree. Hopefully states (like CA just did) will start mandating that new homes have solar. 40% of our greenhouse gases come from homes & comm buildings. 50% of a barrel of oil goes toward making plastics, fertilizer, etc. There’s been little done to replace plastics.
5339 2018-12-27 14:57:35 Do u care to explain wht u mean by diminishing need for oil? From an economic perspective, there is no diminishing need for oil n will never be. US is a net crude exporter now,why?China need oil like they need blood. Not to mention manufacturing and the byproducts of oil.

5344 2018-12-27 14:57:01 Albertans know nothing about Ontario.  It's too complex.  OTOH, AB is a one-dimensional echo chamber.  Yammering about oil and government debt is the provincial hobby.  Emphasis on provincial.

5371 2018-12-27 14:53:28 That's true and it is because there isn't a good system in place. PDP folks destroyed naija so much. From National ID cards, crude oil funds, arms funds stealing to INTEGRITY problem. They should cover their faces. Pathetic!

Whilst you're at it fuck off out the UK too yeah
5376 2018-12-27 14:53:04 When the bosses and Chiefs import there is an allowance Chief and until we stop being ignorant then we will hear our Min of Industry saying it's time to protect our own no more importation of water yoghurt baked beans cooking oil and milk we know we are closer to home.
5377 2018-12-27 14:52:50 Sirota blatantly misrepresented the Oil & Gas donations. Energy workers are some of the highest paid blue collar workers in the country and there are a lot of them in Texas. However, arguing that donations from an industry’s workers means he is owned by that industry is decietful
5378 2018-12-27 14:52:43 It's incredible how few NHLers the Oil Kings have produced. Who owns them anyway?

5392 2018-12-27 14:51:10 "Mistake" need not be measured by stock prices. When Powell used dismissive language re: Bal sheet on "automatic pilot" 10-Yr Treas rallied 12-15 BPs and oil plummeted. Deflationary signals. Is that what the FOMC wanted? Sorry, it was a mistake

5416 2018-12-27 14:48:40 HAHAHAHAHAHAHA SANA OIL
5417 2018-12-27 14:48:38 This sort of rot can be like stopping an oil tanker. I’m not even sure if the captain is slowing down yet
5418 2018-12-27 14:48:11 Looks more natural and is better for you skin (not much coverage but I don’t think you need that). Get a cheap eyeshadowpallete from NYX or I (heart) makeup. BUT very important get good cleansing oil/water and face scrubs too. Keep your skin clean love
5419 2018-12-27 14:48:08 Yeah let's not innovate or try to get off of fossil fuels. Just burn coal,oil and Natural gas.

5424 2018-12-27 14:47:39 Very true.. Where to Put Oil..
5425 2018-12-27 14:47:27 No..the oil companies do...Look how China buying farmers lands in Myanmar then evicting them for oil production ..taking away fishing rights for oil tanker water routes...Oil Cos destroying lives, livihoods worldwide...
5426 2018-12-27 14:47:27 Baby oil pangblend ko sa oil paint hehe
5427 2018-12-27 14:47:26 Yes, banning is good, or charging/fining enough to make them uneconomic, but smaller fines will end up on the customers even if you levy them on oil companies.

The world relies on oil & will for a few more generations.  And it’s not Canada who is the planet killer.  Get your facts straight.  #ColdHearted

5450 2018-12-27 14:45:21 His point stands.  By holding LTC year after year, you’re missing the opportunity to hold Bitcoin - a better performing asset.

Your argument is akin to holding oil stocks over the past ten years when you could’ve held Amazon.  “Hey buddy, stocks are stocks!”
5451 2018-12-27 14:45:02 So glad they arrived safely. Ini paling baik ditaro di laci/lemari sebagai pengganti kamper. Wanginya beda2 sih tp at best mungkin 2-3 bulan. Nanti kl wanginya udh pudar bisa di-revive dengan Essential Oil ditetesin aja di permukaannya <3

5454 2018-12-27 14:44:54 Betos stance isn’t to boost oil/gas... ‘Enacting comprehensive energy reform that optimizes the uses of current energy sources while incentivizing the innovation of new and renewable sources of energy.’ From his 2018 campaign website.
5455 2018-12-27 14:44:46 Thanks Tony! What a list, I feel like an impostor!
5456 2018-12-27 14:44:42 It’s honestly pretty sad and fucked up that Bernie Sanders personally paid his supporters to force Beto to have a shitty voting record and take large sums of Oil money back when Beto was a nobody. What a long haul, but it’s paying off. So much for the tolerant left!!
5457 2018-12-27 14:44:25 Something to think about for 2019 > we could be driving electric cars if not for the oil companies. We could be living in zero energy houses if not for the utilities companies. Now Japan is disregarding a ban on whale hunting. Happy New Year.
5458 2018-12-27 14:44:19 Most of America: I can’t afford to change my oil

5459 2018-12-27 14:44:16 Me always when I go get an oil change. Offering me all sorts of nonsense.
5460 2018-12-27 14:44:13 Chinese food sounds oil .
5461 2018-12-27 14:43:57 sad that he's a liar? I agree. He wants to scare you from proven medicine to his snake oil.
5462 2018-12-27 14:43:41 @Wild4Games Hey, I just started oil painting and am using canvas pads as of now.  Any advice on how to store them so that I can monitor my progress without having them laying around everywhere?
5463 2018-12-27 14:43:39 Oil is going to surprise to the upside.
5464 2018-12-27 14:43:30 Should’ve put a little more effort into my appearance before I came to get my oil changed this morning 
5465 2018-12-27 14:43:28 Lol you aren’t crazy I heard that bc if you try to dry out your face it just makes more oil but I’m nervous to try that out lol, but you’re welcome, hope one of them works for you!!
5466 2018-12-27 14:43:12 no, you gotta eat all the salt and oil as well
5467 2018-12-27 14:43:08 ask them to stop oil trade, if they can! 

One can just laugh on such statements!
5468 2018-12-27 14:43:04 I wish we were this political conscious 10 years ago when oil was still $100 pb.

5471 2018-12-27 14:42:44 I want my Jetta back. I miss scraping on everything, ripping my front lip off on small bumps, nonexistent gas mileage, the smell of oil blow by burning up, and my check engine light glaring at me:(
5472 2018-12-27 14:42:34 The government should take some responsibilities as lack of investment for years did not help, of course during the first sanctions price of oil reached 100 dollars at some point now is almost is half like that.
5473 2018-12-27 14:42:10 What about oil
5474 2018-12-27 14:42:00 The latest Gers data for Scotland shows that for 2017-18 overall state spending hit £73.4bn compared to tax income of just under £60bn, including oil revenues. That left a deficit for the year of £13.4bn. That's a deficit equivalent to 7.9% of GDP. 
Face it, you need England.
5475 2018-12-27 14:41:57 Bread and red oil. 
5476 2018-12-27 14:41:55 The choice in 2019 between a climate change denier and a snake oil salesman that bought a pipeline is no choice at all. Is 2019 the year the @CanadianGreens makes serious inroads before it’s too late?
5477 2018-12-27 14:41:51 Thanks for the input Trevor, are you speaking to all brands of conveyors? Is it the canola that reacted with the belt or the canola oil after rollers crush it? We are trying to prove that our conveyor will not crush the seed therefore keeping belt and rollers clean and dry.
5478 2018-12-27 14:41:49 This is such good news aside from the whole palm oil thing I ate about 27 of them yesterday 
5479 2018-12-27 14:41:44 Yes, because opposing the prison-industrial complex, which has destroyed millions of lives for the sake of maintaining a force of cheap labor for corporate interests, is meaningless. Same with Big Oil and the MIC - neither of which pose any threat to the world at all.
5480 2018-12-27 14:41:42 Learned how to make Rick Simpson oil for medicinal reasons and passed the knowledge on to many others. As my Dr would prescribe it but this Government are a shambolic bunch of liars.
5481 2018-12-27 14:41:35 More stupidity from you. As Bill D said presidents have no control over gas prices. The only way they could is to take the strategic oil reserve and flood the market and that is only temporary.

5487 2018-12-27 14:40:56 Thanks!! The next like 8 days will use that logic, hopefully we only have to pack like salt/oil basics
5488 2018-12-27 14:40:49 add a small amout of oil - then rough mash it using a potato masher. If you cant get a firm consistency add a small amount of milk. Shape into balls the size of small tangerines then squish flat to give small "cakes". Fry in hot oil (or better lard of dripping!) until the crisp.
5489 2018-12-27 14:40:42 Yes. Pls come with anointing oil Brother Okacha Gave us last time.

I dont think "burn it all down" is meant to be the takeaway, but serious reform, away from the current status quo

5500 2018-12-27 14:39:58 It takes money to win and that's why we need those oil companies pumping it in and they deserve their money's worth!
5501 2018-12-27 14:39:53 1. O'Rourke signed a pledge not to take fossil fuel money specifically from individuals in the industry.
2. His campaign took half a million dollars from individuals in the industry, $80,000 maxed donations from oil executives.
3. His money was bundled & funneled through a pac.

5504 2018-12-27 14:39:47 @SenateGOP @DemWarRoom The Oil/Gas Industry has had fifty years to invest in Clean Energy Technology. If they are not ready to transition it is their failure. We should end Tax Breaks for Depletion in 2019.
5505 2018-12-27 14:39:45 I say that [genuflects] Obama just demanded to be thanked for all the oil he drilled. That’s pro-environment? Liberal Democrats like to think they have principles, but that’s just virtue signaling. They will surrender any principle, even for tactical reasons
5506 2018-12-27 14:39:39 Also,ISIS had unlimited resources with oil & Mesopotamian archeological relics which they sold in black market. In India, ISIS per se could never run interference coz of our geography and border security. So all ISIS can do is radicalized gullible people and send them on suicide.
5507 2018-12-27 14:39:35 l'huile / oil
5508 2018-12-27 14:39:31 Then perhaps we need to lessen our dependence on oil.  

And I’m sure you include aid to Israel as part of countries “solving their own problems.”  Because no country in the Middle East gets more aid than Israel ($3.2B) second only to Afghanistan.

5530 2018-12-27 14:36:41 @Thom_Hartmann Oil prices are doing what the FED used to. Instead of interest rates helping stimulate the economy & cool it, Big oil does that with oil prices, that way they make huge profits during the booming periods. Check out the historical data.
5531 2018-12-27 14:36:11 All true. The LibDems tried for years to be non political politicians. Once they were offered a turn, they happily bolstered the most right wing Tory government ever. There are no independent politicians. Those who say they are also sell snake oil.

5548 2018-12-27 14:34:35 Fry it in butter/olive oil until just not the point of browning. Add chicken/vegetable stock, add peeled, chopped up potatoes. Boil, then simmer for 30 minutes. Liquidise, add single cream.  Yer actual vichysoisse.

5552 2018-12-27 14:34:10 India has emerged as the world's sixth largest financial and global business partner in the report released by the United Nations despite crude oil prices and inflation. It is pride that GDP growth has been developed by various measures of the Modi-led central government.

5558 2018-12-27 14:33:39 I *hate* kitchen gadgets, and *love* our air fryer. We have good luck making chicken fillets and salmon, and it does pretty well with those breaded chicken cutlets.

I find tossing chicken in olive oil and coating with seasoning works pretty nicely.

5562 2018-12-27 14:33:31 This might be obvious to some people but was new to me. I am allergic to tree nuts and avoid food and cosmetics with walnut, pecan, and almond derivatives. Recently, I have learned (the hard way) that shea butter and argan oil also come from tree nuts.  #allergies

5571 2018-12-27 14:32:08 I’ve worked in northern Saskatchewan for years, downwind of the AB oil sands with the “huge” CO2 emissions, and wondered who was looking at the local temperature effects. Every climate scientist I asked about this CO2/temperature relationship would block me. Interesting.

5581 2018-12-27 14:30:50 Iran's 2019 budget has a benchmark of $54 as it prepares to reduce oil dependence. It has the least oil dependent budget among OPEC, has four times Nigeria's reserves and produces almost twice Nigeria's capacity without sanctions. @AsoRock oil benchmark of $60 is too ambitious.

5603 2018-12-27 14:27:25 Oil has plunged 40%. That says a lot about the global economy in 2019
5604 2018-12-27 14:27:20 Two observations where there are disconnects:  audusd and usdcnh dont seem to have the correlation they once had.  Usdmxn is no longer a risk trade, just a dollar trade and seems immune to oil price moves or equities.  Usdcad, however is still old school risk and oil.

5610 2018-12-27 14:26:58 It can be done. Look at Liverpool (if they don’t completely bottle things & win 0 yet again this season).Their investment in players isn’t from oil money, it’s from some shrewd investment of massive sale proceeds (not free transfer losses).

5679 2018-12-27 14:18:50 The gas tax@was 4 cents. Oil ppb + switch to winter gas makes up the price drop... unless Ontario can somehow affect the price drop in USA, as well.
5680 2018-12-27 14:18:47 I think people have realized you're a snake-oil salesman, and the wall is your snake oil.  You could build the wall from one coast to another, a hundred feet high, but it will need gateways through, it cannot stop the jets that go over, tunnels under, or boats that go around.

5687 2018-12-27 14:17:12 Woah, dump her. You don't need this negativity in your life. I don't want to imagine how she feels about olive oil!
5688 2018-12-27 14:16:57 Hmmm also, if Alberta oil field workers had two booms, why didn't they set some money aside to further their education? 

You know? Like a lot of other responsible adults do?
5689 2018-12-27 14:16:55 Funny, fuel was more expensive here in Alberta a year ago, too. Gee, do you think global oil prices have anything to do with that?

P.S. My box is non-partisan, Genius.

5707 2018-12-27 14:15:40 You’re right. I hate liars and as for his administration, who the hell are they? We’re down to 3rd string snake oil salesmen like Whitaker. His entire administration is as corrupt as he is.
5708 2018-12-27 14:15:37 Yay, jails & oil companies rule!
5709 2018-12-27 14:15:26 By this logic 27/28 red states are fairly worthless in terms of value brought. What’s the cash crop in LA again? Those oil companies are going to have a hell of a time doing pipeline business as well. I wonder how that energy grid will be reworked to play to domestic energy state
5710 2018-12-27 14:15:24 Lol
5711 2018-12-27 14:15:20 And we're still arguing over a carbon tax, which is essentially the least we can do as a stop gap measure! It's fucking nuts.

Oil has been such a destructive force in humanity, we should be jumping to get off it.

5716 2018-12-27 14:14:56 I think it was stick shock indigestion. Remeber the first time we hit $4 oil vs the 2nd time we did? Also, having been at 0 for so long, the shock of moving off becomes that much greater.
5717 2018-12-27 14:14:10 Are you saying that he is cutting Defense spending? I see no evidence of that. It is his prerogative to reallocate this spending to areas of greater need or return. Why should we defend the Middle East to protect China’s oil supply?
5718 2018-12-27 14:14:08 Psst, crazy Yvette: Russia and the US are net EXPORTERS of oil. This tired accusation of everything bad we do was for oil is not applicable.

But thanks for dragging out this golden oldie. Reminding us all why wing-nut leftists are not in the presidency anymore.

5858 2018-12-27 13:59:38 It's quite true, in Quebec we pay something like 30 cent/l more, however the main reason the price of gas is low today is due to cheap oil prices, today $46/barrel, and overproduction of gasoline. In any case taxpayers would pay at least 30 cent/l more with carbon tax in place!!!

5955 2018-12-27 13:48:36 So you want to credit Norway for putting money aside....criticize Alberta for not putting aside enough....all the while trying to stop the production and delivery of oil? Does Norway ban offshore drilling on one coast? Do they oppose pipelines and tanker traffic?

5967 2018-12-27 13:47:12 I've heard the Luna oil is good, did you like that too?
5968 2018-12-27 13:47:00 Well the Pentagon identified it as a threat to national security so it prob makes sense to discuss it with the guys tasked with handling the fall out of climate change, which is not a political issue. Tough to accept, I’m sure, for someone in your industry.

Here in Peru they've been talking for years about selling shares in state oil company Petroperu. Profit margin and ROE are in low single digits with mad political risk in the jungle regions where they drill.
6088 2018-12-27 13:34:16 All this talk about "pipelines", but nothing in this suggests how this will replace oil, which is basically what pipeline implies. You don't power cars on tidal, solar or wind

6094 2018-12-27 13:33:48 I have used CBD oil but not consistently so I can't give good testimony. In the process of weaning myself off pain meds since no doctor wants to prescribe opioids even to those who truly need it so I may need to be more consistent with it. I have a back injury that is inoperable.
6095 2018-12-27 13:33:37 But only after my first tea in the morning. It's the oil in my engine.
6096 2018-12-27 13:33:37 Impressive that you are able to control the global price of oil. Can you work your magic with the stock market? You grossly underestimate the intelligence of (non-Ford nation) Ontario. #Cdnpoli #fordnation #onpoli
6097 2018-12-27 13:33:33 Modi Govt got crude oil prices down for his entire Period... Instead of improving condition of economy ,he made economy hell...
6098 2018-12-27 13:33:24 Russia is totally starving to death.  They cannot maintain their military crap...and you say they are threatening us?  If France and Germany did not buy oil and gas from them, they fold.   And, THAT gas money never reaches Russia.
6099 2018-12-27 13:33:13 Try not to see me as some crazy old lady. We(hippies) did notice what was going on. The Oceans, oil company messes, extinction of species and political games. We were arrested and treated as if we were a social misfit.
6100 2018-12-27 13:33:11 I want to recommend they target ads to those on the carnivore diet.  But taking the marketing hat off I’d tell them to eat fruits and veggies. Supplement nutritional deficiencies but try to get most of your nutrients from Whole Foods. I don’t eat fish, so I take fish oil.
6101 2018-12-27 13:33:09 Yes, but with eucalyptus oil instead of  Vick’s. I absolutely hated it, but it did kind of work

6107 2018-12-27 13:32:22 Agree. Too often the term “Big Oil” favored by the press and environmental & consumer advocates does a favor to the biggest miscreants in the industry, like, in this case, @MarathonPetroCo, who hide behind the generic label and trade association affiliations.

6111 2018-12-27 13:31:58 When we don't pray we  become dry spiritually.
 Many what's to  be anointed,  but the annointing does not dwell in dry places. To become anointed you must have a life of prayer. How else can the fire keep burning without oil?

6118 2018-12-27 13:31:30 Denmark and Scandinavian countries have so much success in capitalism that they could afford a generous social net. Norway for example is sitting on Oil. But as all wealth has limits they are making immigration harder.

6127 2018-12-27 13:30:37 And then it stagnated when those actions showed diminishing returns. The economy is global. 2017 was a great economic year around the world. Even Japan boomed. But now those problems of 2015-16 are back - oil collapse, China/Europe weakness/instability, & now trade war.

6134 2018-12-27 13:29:52 Because that’s his name.

Beto is his cool nickname.

Both voted to deregualte Wall Street, allow offshore drilling and won’t endorse #M4A.

Both also take huge amounts of money from hedge funds, oil & gas and private healthcare.

6141 2018-12-27 13:29:18 He can do whatever he wants. And you can feel free not to vote for Beto...if he even bothers to run, which is why the week long freak-out about Beto's oil money, has seemed not genuine. YMMV, obvi

6146 2018-12-27 13:28:37 It's because of the different bubbles that Twitter and msm occupy. In Twitter every feed is unique and reality becomes subjective/individualized. But in msm it's purely partisan and bipartisan propaganda for the MIC, oil, pharma and wall street.
Hail Satan.

6148 2018-12-27 13:28:32 Even though the fact checkers don't know what there talking abou bringing up other provinces, then saying oil is down, well here's the news flash Alberta has always had cheaper fuel, and oil has been down for a decade now while the gas prices were soaring with the liberals
6149 2018-12-27 13:28:29 Could be wrong, but I don't think come this January Nancy Pelosi and the will be proposing legislation favorable to Wall Street, Oil&Gas, Pharma, or the NRA.
6150 2018-12-27 13:28:15 I agree-we all know there are millions of barrels there,and when they start releasing prelim figures,this will fly into the 20s ....
But he does need a kick start up the derriere lol
6151 2018-12-27 13:28:00 Because the PTB made ISIS and they bow and scrape to Saudi because of oil , the idea is destroy Saudi's enemies

6160 2018-12-27 13:26:23 None of these economy reports are accounting for the fact that I drink barrel after barrel of crude oil every day
6161 2018-12-27 13:26:21 And that would make it quite political.  

I'll hang on the strange point that most people whom I follow for this info are all against fracking...should they have no opinion if it was a right wing tale to encourage oil production? 

It's not following there at all.

6164 2018-12-27 13:26:06 Incinerating take: Since crude oil/petroleum is actually abiotic and not biotic, everything in this world is the direct result of unnecessary oil price manipulation.

Baleen was used in a number of consumer products, such as corsets.

6183 2018-12-27 13:23:24 Weak analysis with little basis.

Other than being ethnically Kurdish, YPG and the KRG have really quite little in common other than that.

One is a Marxist militia formed a few years ago, the other is a capitalist plutocracy with a  embassy, sitting on tons of oil.

Kidding aside, I do understand the urge to withdraw digital assets, which is why we're building the bridge. Wish people would have more patience during construction.

6194 2018-12-27 13:22:00 OMG, Jim Paulsen is more volatile than the stock market. So now he is up with the following thesis:
- Inflation will come back (oil and commodities rally)
- That weakens the economy to 1.9%
AND THEN the FED pauses the rate hikes because the economy is weakening.

6227 2018-12-27 13:18:30 It’s a natural sediment agent that’s helps particles coagulate in water and sediment. Oil potentially could work with this as it doesn’t mix well with water. It’s a matter of if the electrolytes in the filtering agent can coagulate and hold dense oil.

6242 2018-12-27 13:15:38 Lunch is less pretty today. Three eggs boiled last night, chopped roughly into a bowl with some already-hot marrowfat peas and sweetcorn. Add a dash of chili oil, and we have deliciousness!
6243 2018-12-27 13:15:30 Parut kita dekat tempat yang sama :') cuba guna bio oil hmmmm
6244 2018-12-27 13:15:28 Not if the powerful oil companies are exempt or can buy (from auction ) a way out.
6245 2018-12-27 13:15:12 Phillip urged them through a watertight hatch into a carpeted hallway hung with oil paintings and a sculpture that sparkled with moving light.
6246 2018-12-27 13:15:12 It is. In my view, long term contango is prima facie evidence of financialisation. As was divergence of $/MMbtu between oil & natural gas.

6249 2018-12-27 13:14:43 Oil Marketing Cos (HPCL IN & BPCL IN): HPCL  and BPCL have seen rollovers of 47% and 61% respectively on the D-1.  Akin to other PSU names, negative roll cost (HPCL & BPCL: -290bps  each) factors in dividend  in the Jan expiry.

6251 2018-12-27 13:14:23 u know what they dont get?

If Scotland is so fucked RIGHT NOW , under the cosh of a democratic deficit making the financial decisions for us , without a say in them, keeping 60% of our Tax and near 95% of our oil as the cost of failure, surely its time for new fucking management
6252 2018-12-27 13:14:22 CBD oil really helps.
I’ve had back pains since I was a kid. 
I have taken all sorts of pain medications from my doctor but only helps for a bit and takes a while to kick in. 
CBD oil is the best pain medication you can take IMO
6253 2018-12-27 13:14:15 I always try to avoid the snake oil salesmen. And when I see someone attempting to buy the oil it is my good nature that pushes me to interfere. Sometimes it bubbles up as hostility. People getting ripped off by Q upsets me.
6254 2018-12-27 13:14:11 Not only do they want it, there are forces in our government planning it, trying to make it happen. The #Khashoggi thing attempting to drive up oil prices, the arrest of the Huewai CFO to sabotage a deal with China, #FederalReserve raising rates again and again, etc etc...
6255 2018-12-27 13:14:04 thanks. theres a local medical supply store close to me that sells cbd oil and capsules, not sure what brand but id assume whatever they sell should be pretty decent since they work with the hospital its next to.
6256 2018-12-27 13:14:02 Didn’t exist. Plastic is a Bi-product of oil
6257 2018-12-27 13:13:59 The Oil Industry Spent $31 Million to Kill a Climate Change Measure.. This must STOP. Money in politics must be made illegal.

6267 2018-12-27 13:11:46 #Trump: the world's gotta a price for USA to fight in Iraq. Not earning enough from the Oil, then? #wato
6268 2018-12-27 13:11:42 We have been in the Mid East largely because of American oil interests.

Oil is something we definitely need to use far less of, so our commitment to that area should fade.

I’d prefer it to be orderly and make sense as we leave, not the chaotic mess left by Trump.

6299 2018-12-27 13:08:43 Why don't they ban plastic bags, because then there would be less things to tax. Plastic can be turned back into the oil from which it is made. We could, like the USA legalise the growing of hemp and make totally biodegradable bag from hemp........then tax them.
6300 2018-12-27 13:08:41 Had a moron in a lifted Ford with Alberta plates ask me to move my truck from in front of the diesel pump that I was actually using to fill my truck. He was pretty emphatic that he needed to use it.

6307 2018-12-27 13:08:15 So, what is needed is an analysis of what this actually means WRT internal family politics/factions/Sudeiri block v. the rest of the royals.

6325 2018-12-27 13:06:07 was recently debating trying this to see if it would help with some anxiety/drinking issues. the whole CBD thing seems to be marketed like snake oil curing everything so ive not really taken it seriously.

6336 2018-12-27 13:03:55 I think the big issue was they had oil/coolant get into the housing.  It was nasty when I first opened it up.
6337 2018-12-27 13:03:44 Entonces amigo Alolejos no estás acumulando $, estás rotando capital entre BTC y cortos de SPX y OIL, y para ellos hay que estar siempre haciendo largos en el USDVES, y cortos para reponer INVENTARIOS de Mercancía.
6338 2018-12-27 13:03:38 Scotland has never had any financial advantage from its vast oil resources which we're told have been running out since 1974. Remember? You have absolutely  no say in the debate over Scotlands future, so why the interest? I conclude you a troll. Enjoy your Brexit.  Bye.

6344 2018-12-27 13:01:55 It should also be added that the US has consistently been more invested in Iraq than Syria because of oil.

6346 2018-12-27 13:01:51 Every such act of savagery will only put oil to fire in the majority community and retaliatory action becomes unavoidable.

6348 2018-12-27 13:01:46 Rupee ended weaker against the US Dollar, as crude recovered some losses. Dollar purchases by importers to meet month-end payments weighed on the domestic currency. Trade volumes remained muted. The rupee opened down as crude oil prices rose nearly 8% on Wednesday.

the scent is close to that of body oil, sort of. that's best way i could describe it

Opiod capital, NDP socialists, anti Canadian
6354 2018-12-27 13:01:17 Earlier in the day, bonds had fallen because of a sharp overnight rise in US Treasury yields and oil prices. The yield on 10-year G-sec ended at 7.28% vs. previous close of 7.26%.

6356 2018-12-27 13:01:12 Government bond prices ended lower today, erasing all gains, as RBI sets lower-than-expected cut-off prices at today's INR 150 bn OMO bond purchase auction. Fall in crude oil prices supported bond prices.

6430 2018-12-27 12:52:21 Yes but that is all energy. Oil is about 30% of energy production.
6431 2018-12-27 12:52:02 Yeah, it's tough being in England (not English as Scouse, obvs), and having Corbyn/Labour as pretty much the sole hope, and trying to reconcile that with the continued theft of Scottish oil, to allow continued poor Westminster decisions. The empire must see its end.

I use it to brown rice before cooking. Use it in place of butter or oil to brown or sautee, for a different flavor.
When you pour it into the jar, pour it through a coffee filter to remove the cooked bits.

6513 2018-12-27 12:41:13 最近物性の理論に行こうかなと考えてきたんですが、今度スカイプで色々教えてもらえませんか？
6514 2018-12-27 12:41:12 Of course... that makes it hard, and viral by accident at scale is very visible... so BS about "off the shelf secret sauce" or solutions for scale are rampant... pure snake oil!

Recently gave a talk on social media, my first words were "there is no one size fits solution"
6515 2018-12-27 12:41:10 Tomorrow libarals and media will attack even this... "Due to use of oil lamps there is shortage of cooking oil in state.

Do we need oil lamps!"
6516 2018-12-27 12:41:09 Hey. Somewhere a Trump supporter very carefully dipped those in brown cooking oil.

6519 2018-12-27 12:40:56 We can treat each other with respect & discuss the issues. I was 1st Finance Minister in Ghana's Oil Era to experience steep drops in price in 2015 & 2016. I owe it a duty to fellow citizens to draw attention to trends, insults notwithstanding. Best of the Season of GOODWILL.

6523 2018-12-27 12:40:24 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
6524 2018-12-27 12:40:24 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

6545 2018-12-27 12:38:10 Look I prosecuted along the Texas southern border. I live close to the Mexican border. I am not in danger. We have a very low violent crime rate. The immigrants come here and work in the oil fields and are productive people.

6551 2018-12-27 12:36:50 That's true Kyle, but the President's stated reasons for withdrawing from #Syria can just as easily apply to #Iraq. What's the difference? Oil perhaps? He's stated before we should just take Iraq's oil...

6553 2018-12-27 12:36:37 Don’t buy those unbranded carts. If whoever’s trying to sell it to you can’t tell you who/where the oil is from. Seen a girl selling Supreme and O/W ones. Could be made in someone’s garage or a trap in Mexico. If you hit some fentanyl or something it’s a dub for your life.

6576 2018-12-27 12:33:30 But really if only all of these plutocrats (by hook or by crook) can just go into mass production ventures across the agriculture and oil and gas value chain, the positive effect this will have on real output, income and employment will be game changing
6577 2018-12-27 12:33:23 Oil contributes  less than 10% to Nigeria's GDP.
6578 2018-12-27 12:32:59 Put Coconut oil on your dry hair leave in for 30 minutes cover with a shower cap or a plastic bag then shampoo and condition your hair do it twice a week and it should grow it out twice as fast, You can add a few drops of coconut oil into your shampoo aswell just melt it first!
6579 2018-12-27 12:32:48 Didn't know they'd found oil near Gatwick. I thought it was drones!!!
6580 2018-12-27 12:32:39 Elon Musk: We know we'll run out of dead dinosaurs to mine for fuel & have to use sustainable energy eventually, so why not go renewable now & avoid increasing risk of climate catastrophe? Betting that science is wrong & oil companies are right is the dumbest experiment in histor
6581 2018-12-27 12:32:36 How much of the spending is the middle east, which isn't stable and which doesn't matter to our economy beyond oil flow from Saudi Arabia?

That we need so much spending to preserve our economy is debatable.

If China is the concern, Trump's budget is heavy on plane/ship spending

Todd sat on the bench, massaged baby oil into his biceps, swallowed a handful of Vicodin.

6800 2018-12-27 12:04:39 Funding for ISRU has always been sparse and waxes and wanes. It is particularly challenging to get investors even though timelines and funding levels are similar to earth mines and offshore oil development. A big difference is technology risk and customers.

6947 2018-12-27 11:40:26 I agree with that; don’t agree Beto is “pro oil”. 

He ran in Texas & accepted $$ from individuals in the oil biz, but not pac or corporate money.

Btw I’m not even a “Beto supporter” and Green/ AGW is my #1 thing; just think we should focus on bringing down Trump not fellow Ds.

6994 2018-12-27 11:32:48 So y'all realize Texas is an oil state which means a lot of people are employed by the oil industry which means a lot of Beto's donations come from ppl who work in the oil industry, but your conclusion is, based on that, he would not promote environmental saving policies? *sigh*

7001 2018-12-27 11:31:00 Alvarez et al (Science 361:186-188, 2018) show methane losses in the oil and natural gas supply chain as 325 MMt CO2e annually, more than the 245 MMt CO2-e/yr of methane attributed to  USA agriculture for 2015. This is largely the source of the CH4 increases in the last decade.

7073 2018-12-27 11:19:44 Exactly! And politicians, as they run out of options to explain how the world runs and what they can really do to improve the situation of the citizens... increasingly turn towards trying to sell the most attractive snake oil.

7092 2018-12-27 11:16:34 If EVs do not displace that much oil demand (or more) per day, do you think oil production can continue to grow out to 2040 at a rate that meets demand?

Sometimes, we have to pay attention to it;

7109 2018-12-27 11:14:12 It's because some natural remedies do have Scientific evidence proving them to be successful while others are just sold by good marketing.

7110 2018-12-27 11:14:06 Five Things You Need To Know Today (27/12):

7116 2018-12-27 11:12:20 One product removes it all. Great for heavy makeup. One less product to buy! Win 

 Removes dirt, oil, makeup and other pore-clogging impurities 
 Applies like an oil, so it doesn’t strip the skin
 Turns into a foam, so it’s easy to remove with water
7117 2018-12-27 11:12:16 A lunch idea... Saute green onions in olive oil and garlic until fragrant. Add chicken thigh and vodka sauce. Cook thoroughly. Serve with toasted white bread and a bit of diced kimchi.
7118 2018-12-27 11:12:10 How can Twitter influence me?i want to work in any international oil and gas,I want to utilise the experience have gathered in national owned oil and gas industry in international way,twitter do your things.
7119 2018-12-27 11:11:29 Z, I’d recommend trying some CBD oil it’s honestly a life saver. Me and my girlfriend use it on a daily basis. And if u take some before bed it helps u relax & u get a great nights sleep.

7132 2018-12-27 11:08:27 Much as one has to sympathize with Alberta for its present predicament, all this talk of separation seems misguided. Once out of Canada, with US demand for oil imports way down, how in the world would landlocked Alberta get any pipelines built to tidewater?

7135 2018-12-27 11:08:03 Diversifying the economy is the best way to improve economy and not rely on oil and that's what the government is doing.

7139 2018-12-27 11:07:06 Canada's CFIB Business Barometer fell to its lowest level in over 2yrs at 53.6. Concerns were brought on by low export prices for domestic oil and fears of what would mean throughout the supply chain $CAD
7140 2018-12-27 11:07:02 Green energy plans would create jobs if the republicans would stop taking money from the oil & coal lobbyists. Solar panels and wind turbines have to be built and someone needs to work in the running of the energy from them. Look new manufacturing jobs that we've lost to tariffs

England takes most of our oil wheat and live stock.
So not over 50% get it.

7162 2018-12-27 11:04:07 You all do make  important points.. the solution ultimately has to be nuanced. Prices can lower+more green investment. Countries highly dependent on oil employ similar tactics. e.g, Astana's AIFC made green investment central to the centres goal.
7163 2018-12-27 11:03:53 Anyone else traumatized the whole time we were invading all these random countries in the Middle East for oil? I didn’t consent to that. And then if you make taxes you gotta pay for that shit

7176 2018-12-27 11:01:21 Yes, because oil barrels grow on trees. 
Btw, most battery packs get a second life for energy storage or can be recycled.
7177 2018-12-27 11:01:14 What’s “purity police” & why is it bad? Because we should expect candidates beholden to oil companies, poverty wages, unaffordable healthcare? Centrist Dems have had their chance for decades.

7227 2018-12-27 10:51:22 Yes it also pollution free and can be remotely controlled by voice . Best part is international oil  prices does not affect the owner

7231 2018-12-27 10:50:28 I believe the inside is largely coconut oil (24 degrees melting point) and cocoa butter (34 degrees melting point - close to body temperature, hence why is such a loved ingredient as it “melts in your mouth”) so probably between the two?

7245 2018-12-27 10:47:34 Taxpayers have spent a thousandfold more dollars pushing the global warming lie than all of the oil companies combined. It isn't even close. And you still lost. Because sane people understand a trace gas doesn't run climate.

7270 2018-12-27 10:43:52 #Oil fell on Thursday after soaring 8% in the previous session as worries over a glut in crude supply and concerns over a faltering global economy pressured prices even as a stock market surge offered support. Brent crude oil futures LCOc1 were down 22 cents or 0.4% at $54.25/bb.

7307 2018-12-27 10:38:27 So occasionally a morsel of “good news” such as the “discovery” of oil at Muzarabani is occasionally thrown at us so we can forget our misery. It’s astonishing how that tactic seems to appease us even though we know our lives didn’t change from Chiadzwa diamonds & Lupane gas.

7314 2018-12-27 10:37:02 America won't buy oil because it empowers the Saudis.

We won't buy cars because we suck at designing a decent one.

#murica won't buy cocaine because marijuana has the momentum now.

America won't even buy carbon credits from the EU because Muslim French girls might get books
7315 2018-12-27 10:36:59 Make sure you're moisturing your hair so it doesn't overcompensate and produce more oil from lack of moisture, washing it everyday will only be worse in the long run
7316 2018-12-27 10:36:55 So I called my mom and told her that her peppermint theory made her Twitter famous...she accused me of making her sound like a snake oil merchant...

7317 2018-12-27 10:36:48 Countries are divided between tribes.

7323 2018-12-27 10:36:06 Well, if so, and to an adequate intensity of diversification, I’d agree with you. All the bellyaching sure suggests a continuing dependence on the oil market. But yes, your argument may have validity in principle. I still think normal taxation would have been the way to go.

7327 2018-12-27 10:35:32 Scotland is allocated a spend per head greater than the rest of the UK.

Less than half of that spend is spent in Scotland.

Meanwhile, Ireland, with no oil, little natural resource, and less people has a higher revenue.

7338 2018-12-27 10:33:46 Naphthalene is made from crude oil or coal tar. It is also produced when things burn, so it is found in cigarette smoke, car exhaust, and smoke from forest fires. It is used as an insecticide and repellent it was first registered as a pesticide in the United States in 1948.

7350 2018-12-27 10:31:33 There is an illogicality to it for sure; but without informing people of the consequences of their actions nothing will change. Are you something to do with the oil or airline industries?

Scotland is a UK net contributor. N. Ireland concern was that if Scotland got Indy their subsidies would have been slashed.

7354 2018-12-27 10:30:37 How does it matter bro. Get money and then buy oil with that money or get oil straight away.
Allthough I am not sure its this simple that's not how international trade works.

7385 2018-12-27 10:23:20 Hard to defend that based on titles won though. 

If you focus on the last 100 years, and ignore the dirty oil money titles, Sunderland have one win - 35/36, City have two - 36/37 & 67/68.

Sunderland have 2 FA cups - 37 & 73, City have 3 - 34, 56 & 69.

7408 2018-12-27 10:18:55 That's bollocks too. They DO NOT have vastly more oil. Their production costs are marginally lower. They have managed their oil much better than the UK, but then they are managing it FOR THEMSELVES. That makes a BIG difference.

7415 2018-12-27 10:17:58 Trump epitomises transactional politics, & in this instance the most cynical orientalism that can be imagined. The region is not seen in the context of its rich contributions to civilisation, & worthy of defending, but in terms of oil & dollars & a people to be exploited.

7417 2018-12-27 10:17:38 If that was what populism is, then fine. But that's not what people mean, is it? Populism offers simple solutions to complex problems; populism suggests that the problem is "them" and not "us"; Populism is what the snake oil salesmen offers to con you out of your money.

7469 2018-12-27 10:07:44 Cause it's cheaper. Solar and wind have higher per unit cost than oil and gas.
7470 2018-12-27 10:07:42 It's the lottery winner effect. If you have a sudden windfall of cabbage (oil dollars), and no experience managing a large sum of money, you are very likely to blow it on large purchases and get to where you were in the beginning.

7499 2018-12-27 10:02:04 Something’s very weird. Sen. Paul & fellow R’s openly aligning w Russia. Mueller watched Russian oil $ infect Brits, 45, Rel Right & R’s b4 2013.

7502 2018-12-27 10:01:42 Real snake oil was made from the fat of the Chinese water snake and was high in Omega 3s. Then some white charlatan came along and made fake snake oil from mineral water & turpentine, thus the name.

7584 2018-12-27 09:48:54 Mayonnaise. Butter or lard (ideally 50/50 with rapeseed oil) lend an interesting flavour and texture. Bacon lard is great for a subtly smoky mayo served with wedges or on a burger.

7615 2018-12-27 09:43:07 Except that's not the point. The point is that Alberta has been in boom times before when oil prices were high. Norway saved then. Alberta didn't. This has nothing to do with the present and everything to do with poor choices in the past.
7616 2018-12-27 09:42:54 We knew all these challenges before 2015, we knew about our revenue challenges and our dependence on oil, the question is: what has changed? Have we diversified? Has our revenue increased significantly? Is there a plan?

7659 2018-12-27 09:36:31 Excellent, looks like we're going to have another year of low oil prices thanks to President Trump.
7660 2018-12-27 09:36:25 Er no. The US is now a major Crude exporter for the first time in decades, virtually all Crude transactions are carried out in Dollars and Chavez single handedly destroyed the Venezuelan oil industry.

What was the reason for the 1983 coup d’etat that brought down Shagari’s govt?

7733 2018-12-27 09:24:05 It is axiomatic that oversupplying a commodity collapses prices. With oil, what’s at stake is consequential especially for African producers. Oil at $50 instead of, say, $80 per barrel represents a $1 trillion loss each year for producers. Think about jobs. @energy_african
7734 2018-12-27 09:23:48 That is absolutely nothing to do with Westminster. All our income, taxes

When America wanted to get serious with the war against ISIS, they first cut down their access to finances - which they largely got through oil sales! This forced ISIS to slash their salaries!

8064 2018-12-27 08:25:08 Hydration is key to clear skin. Dehydration causes breakouts, because the skin overcompensates and produces more oil than necessary when it’s dry, which in turn causes you to break out. Drink more water!

8118 2018-12-27 08:15:55 FG can however device a scheme on how it shares VAT.but that leads to the question whether we now want to pay VAT to states according to what's generated from the state.

8123 2018-12-27 08:15:21 You forget Richard, before the discovery of oil and the modern combustion engine, we rode in wagons using horses and mules. Fossil fuels is what brought us this modern world and what is keeping it.
8124 2018-12-27 08:15:04 This country must be restructured. There is no unity, justice, fairness, equity in all our national conversation. The only thing binding us together is oil money. We must not wait till the tap runs dry. And this is why we need a new leader to drive discussion on restructuring.

8200 2018-12-27 08:00:21 I can't really complain. The old man drove a Range Rover, the precursor to SUVs. In the 1970s. During and oil crises and carless days. Some aren't for change.
8201 2018-12-27 08:00:14 This study also shows that LA is dispensable for obesity. It makes the mistake of using coconut oil as SFA (instead of palm oil?). High LA, accompanied by insufficient n-3, causes more severe dysbiosis and subsequent systemic inflammation than the anti-inflammatory coconut oil.
8202 2018-12-27 08:00:09 Atiku has bribery a crime pending in US court. Rresurrected to bring good old practices of stealing funds meant for ordinary Nigerians. He was VP when oil sold for over $100. Now $50 if Atiku couldn't do much with MDGs then how can he deliver the new SDGswith oil now $50 less
8203 2018-12-27 08:00:07 For people more used to oil field units thats about 4.2 million barrels in Dukes Wood and 1.9 million barrels in Eakring. Great story :-)
8204 2018-12-27 07:59:53 They sold out & use that not cocoa butter stuff and changed  to palm oil ,people didn’t buy it because it’s NASTY .
8205 2018-12-27 07:59:52 The articles I post from years ago are on point about Obama's number from years ago. The article I posted about oil is from TODAY correcting this EXACT article

8208 2018-12-27 07:59:33 I felt very similar until the new CEO arrived. With today's new I believe we have a good little oil company with a reasonable possibility of being a medium oil company.

8217 2018-12-27 07:58:01 (7) China is not doing worst that the Europeans who brought war in our land to get their way. Kill our leaders to get our oil and minerals. They are simply getting into a partnership n  it’s up to our leaders to hold their end of the deal. If they do Africa will continue to grow.

8224 2018-12-27 07:56:45 That simply encourages a deep skin massage... with lots of oil ;)
8225 2018-12-27 07:56:29 Nothing suggests oil price will increase. In fact everything points to reduction but we are planning with a higher ppb.
8226 2018-12-27 07:55:59 Indirect taxes should not be high . It inverts the economy pyramid placing burden on common man . GST burden is high and hitting the common man . Particularly oil which is affecting other sectors . GST compliance is very heavy too .Govt May fall if no remedy.

8228 2018-12-27 07:55:34 How fucked up is Venezuela right now? Even the Cuban doctors that Maduro trades in exchange for oil are refusing to go anymore because it's too goddamned dangerous, and there's nothing for them to eat. Real world socialism in action!
8229 2018-12-27 07:55:07 I used to live in ND. I could breathe there. Hubby's work brought us to WV. Hated the stench of the mills! Went home to ND after 13 yrs during oil boom. O. M. G. ND was now as smelly (if not worse) than WV. I can't breathe in either state anymore. I'm heartbroken about ND.

8233 2018-12-27 07:54:07 They're taking oil from Scottish waters, processing it offshore and selling it off without it ever touching land.
In 2014 alone £37.3bn worth simply disappeared. It was allocated not to Scotland but to the "Unknown Region".
8234 2018-12-27 07:53:46  Diesel trucks, big Hollywood style gas guzzling SUVs, high-performance sports cars less than 10 MPG, leave them running of course when you go in the store.

8240 2018-12-27 07:53:19 I am a certified groomer and can tell you anything with tea tree oil in it is toxic to cats. I also wouldn't risk eucalyptus things. Over all essential oil dissfusers are not a good idea for pets. There are some that are also bad for dogs like cinnamon and peppermint.
8241 2018-12-27 07:53:14 The same foreign reserved your @GEJonathan met at $6 billion and depleted to $29billion despite the oil boom without a single project to show for it. @MBuhari has now taken it to $43 billion with little resources. Isn't that an achievement to you?

8258 2018-12-27 07:50:48 @sardesairajdeep Dear Rajdeep. Modi govt has repaid external borrowings and also did not borrow even for oil imports. Dont you think it is something new worthy to high light in your channel instead of highlighting 70 year old untouchability as if it still exists due to Modi.
8259 2018-12-27 07:50:41 Poverty is using the local dump as your grocery store. Poverty is living in a cardboard shack with no electricity and an oil can as your cook stove. Poverty is not having your own smart phone and using food stamps to buy food.

8272 2018-12-27 07:48:48 On a 3-day fast a person primarily loses water weight. All the sugar in the organs is used up. Then the body has to switch to burning fat. 

What you can do instead of eating solid food is to take tablespoons of oil. That will provide plenty of energy.
8273 2018-12-27 07:48:46 Wonder if they checked the natural gas & oil pipeline areas in North Dakota. It used to be one of the cleanest air states in the nation, but now when I travel through it, it stinks worse than WV, where the steel & tin mills, gas & nuclear plant areas are wretched. Lived in both.

8288 2018-12-27 07:45:36 Correct. I only bought companies with a solid dividend history going back 40+ years. But, oil & gas is too volatile. Sin stocks (tobacco, alcohol, gambling ) are out, too. As are high tech and big pharma. They're always chasing their tails searching for the next blockbuster.

8332 2018-12-27 07:38:40 The problem is that Guardia Nacional at #VenezuelaEnDictadura is just a repressive arm trained now by #Cuba esbirros to perpetuate tyranny. They don't know nothing about oil production, marketing & trading.  A popular saying at #Venezuela says: "que saben los burros d caramelos"
8333 2018-12-27 07:37:57 One 3-in-1 request..truffle infused oil plus some mushrooms plus one arugula 4 the color #kissair

8335 2018-12-27 07:37:39 This is the threshing floor season. The separation of the sheep and the goats are upon us. Many that claimed to see the Lord and do works in his name will be exposed. Guard your oil.
8336 2018-12-27 07:37:23 I love the look of oil paintings but i really don't have the patience to do them

8339 2018-12-27 07:37:05 Indoctrination much? Damn, US culture is sick to the core... Need fresh meat for the dirty oil wars to enrich the predatory kleptocrats I guess . Land of the Slaves.
8340 2018-12-27 07:36:57 Please don’t attempt to frame my position. Congresspersons and Senators are not the Democratic Party, Democratic voters are and I am yet to meet one that does not believe climate change requires a real and immediate response - not an expansion oil production.
8341 2018-12-27 07:36:54 The "oil industry" donations retweet. Tried to pull a fast one. People *employed by oil companies* (in Texas, can you imagine?) finessed to appear to be PAC money. Smeary enough for you?
8342 2018-12-27 07:36:48 I recently got an Oriflame lotion (they should pay me for this advert). It's been beautiful and fast working. But there are lots of others products that work. And I know that adding carrot oil to your regular lotion keeps the 'dry' away.
8343 2018-12-27 07:36:39 i feel sooo sick rn and my essential oil diffuser is saving me
8344 2018-12-27 07:36:18 Fish oil helps too, believe it or not.
8345 2018-12-27 07:36:08 You know what’s worse than getting shampoo in your eye ???

Getting tea tree oil shampoo in your fucking eye  the shit burn and feel cool at the same time

8347 2018-12-27 07:35:43 Those carrying false oil are being exposed in your life. Gaurd your oil because they are coming to kill your anointing and steal your voice. They will promise you the world just to milk you for your potential.

8350 2018-12-27 07:34:48 Karaage, tonkatsu, breaded shrimp, and tempura are all fried in oil, right? But they're not aburaage ("oil-fried")!?
8351 2018-12-27 07:34:36 I thought this was because they use palm oil.  I miss cheez-its.
8352 2018-12-27 07:34:21 Vitamins are often categorized based on their solubility.

8353 2018-12-27 07:34:18 I soak sand in the fat at a low-ish temperature. When the oil is all gone, I sift the sand to ensure that it does not congeal into a mass. Then I have waterproof sand with which to amaze onlookers. IT REMAINS DRY IN WATER! GASP!
8354 2018-12-27 07:34:12 Genocide to Palestinians by Israel. Slavery in Libya. There is no monetary value. No oil. No strategic importance. If it was a European country something would be done. If you know what I mean. What is the purpose of the UN? The UN is useless.

8363 2018-12-27 07:32:20 Hi Mr/Miss,
 I'm carrie from Boerxin Technology Limited China. Our company is a wholesaler , and main product covers CBD/THC oil cartridges and vape pens.Products are high quality and low price.Last, if you want to make a order,we can sent free samples to you.
8364 2018-12-27 07:32:18 Unless you are already a dark person, be aware that shea butter will make you even darker. Carrot oil is good when mixed in your lotion. Otherwise you can just get an Oriflame lotion for dry skin. It works.
8365 2018-12-27 07:32:02 Thanks dear!
We will add oil!
8366 2018-12-27 07:31:42 What amazing powers Mr. Trudeau must have...single handedly causing a world wide oil glut, slashing crude prices to $50 a barrel. Tremble in fear Albertans.

8396 2018-12-27 07:27:18 In case you hadn't noticed ; much of the world is currently at war, using weapons sole by us, supplying oil used by us.
8397 2018-12-27 07:27:16 Environmental rollbacks are always short sighted. Another catastrophic oil spill is on the horizon. Two, they are burning natural gas as though it is a by-product. Yet, trump campaigned on bring back coal. If natural gas is so cheap that we burn it, coal is not nearly as viable.
8398 2018-12-27 07:27:12 No, it was smears like the one about O'Rourke taking big oil money. Sirota is not stupid, he knew exactly what he was doing with his weasel words.

A canvas restricts your imagination the same way AR does. The question is: what do the artists want to tell? Not how… Art realized in oil is for the same imagination like in wood or AR. At the moment artists don’t register AR as an option.
8435 2018-12-27 07:19:56 What happened on Wednesday?
Oil prices have jumped 10%; stocks have made an exceptional leap; DJI has jumped 1086 points.
Until yesterday, the markets were submerged n a state of uncertainty indicating the end of the world!
Is it a solid rise? Is it the final rise before sinking?
8436 2018-12-27 07:19:51 You'll probably find they have board members who are also board members of oil companies.

8449 2018-12-27 07:16:48 Don’t call yourself a progressive if you’re gonna support Beto in 2020. He voted to weaken restrictions on Wall Street, effectively allowing banks to discriminate based on race. He voted in favor of Trump’s immigration policy, and in favor of the the oil industry.

8540 2018-12-27 06:57:23 Bernie doesn’t have to tell #Progressives to vet Beto’s record: #2 recipient of gas & oil w/20+donations from CEO’s & broke pledge he signed to reject fossil fuel $ 20+ times.

 Its called corruption. And Big Oil is incredibly corrupt.

8635 2018-12-27 06:40:34 Writing is like oil refining by fractional distillation. Sometimes you’re pumping out light fractions that flow better than water, sometimes it’s viscous sludge, and sometimes it is oozing tar. And of course all the time there’s flammable fart gases too. It’s been a tar year.
8636 2018-12-27 06:40:34 Also Indian fiscal situation is completely linked to crude oil.

8643 2018-12-27 06:39:32 @AmeeraDavid  miss David what did I say in 2015 oil prices need to be low for 5 years in order to heal the economies so we have 1 year left!

8645 2018-12-27 06:39:29 What good is a candidate who beats Trump but continues to expand fracking in the US and world. I don’t think you’re following what David’s tweets mean. Establishment and a majority of Rs share the same all of the above energy strategy that seeks to expand fracking ( oil and gas).

I'm sorry babe.  You're so cute and I just down right love you but I gotta go get oil for the tractor!!
8650 2018-12-27 06:38:30 Yes! There are lotions that are specifically for oily skin. They'll keep your skin hydrated (so your body won't think it needs to produce more oil) but won't have a greasy feeling. But I'm no expert so if you can seeing a pro is usually the best option.
8651 2018-12-27 06:38:16 そんなことはっ…！！

8667 2018-12-27 06:35:07 i have a question that is most likely going to go unnoticed but i thought i’d ask anyway. electricity is made in factories that use oil, yes? does that mean it’s really helping or just slowing down the inevitable? idk i’m probably missing something but thought i’d ask
8668 2018-12-27 06:35:02 はずかしっ…！！
8669 2018-12-27 06:34:50 With dwindling oil revenues,rising number of JAMB applicants,its obvious that the old method will no longer work so we must devise new ways of doing things.

It's only a foolish person who does same thing over and over again and expect different results.

8679 2018-12-27 06:33:38 That's not true, this visit was planned months ago and Trump tweeted about his visit about three weeks ago, the only concern is how 'selective'was he, (the war is over in Iraq these troops are guarding the oil shipments), hope he visits Troops in Afghanistan to bring them Home.
8680 2018-12-27 06:33:35 It boils down to corruption Chief. If UR produces oil how do I hoodwink you. It’s next to impossible. But if we are to import I get the import license (tender)via unscrupulous means and the landing price is high because I need to grease certain hands.
8681 2018-12-27 06:33:32 olive oil, chucked in some pepper and mixed italian herbs ... is good
8682 2018-12-27 06:33:29 Which essential oil is better for getting people to stop talking to me?

8691 2018-12-27 06:32:09 You are wrong. The US dollar is propped up by its connection to oil purchases. Bitcoin's appeal is that it is a fungible digital currency that does not lock people into a coercive banking/state system while being an accepted medium for instant border-less economic transactions.
8692 2018-12-27 06:32:03 Says who? This needs to be contested. Why should local communities be forced by the state to inhale toxic oil and gas emissions? Why should they be forced by the state to risk gas blowouts? And with #climatedisruption ramping up why are taxpayers even subsidizing fossil fuels?

8696 2018-12-27 06:31:24 The US Invention Secrecy Act is the piece of law that allows for world changing technology to be indefinitely suppressed if the invention poses a threat to the US economy.

8754 2018-12-27 06:24:31 Nope, India is that beautiful woman that makes America go weak knees. They need us more than we need them; not only for fair trade but an equal n most important ally to stand against Chinese Imperialism when their trade war is gong on. thats how we signed Oil for Rice with Iran.

8759 2018-12-27 06:23:48 I’m sorry I missed the one where you talked about @realDonaldTrump renegotiating the NAFTA Agreement not to mention the steel industry taking off again as well as coal and oil.  The economy is at an all time high thanks to deregulation and dismantling Obama’s legacy
8760 2018-12-27 06:23:12 That triple butter cocoa butter body wash I have gives me life every night  & finish it off with some oil , leaves my skin so smooth & soft .
8761 2018-12-27 06:23:03 He voted to allow oil exports after a long ban. He voted in favor of Gulf drilling. He voted to export natural gas. These are all destructive with regard to climate change. In my view, disqualifying.
8762 2018-12-27 06:23:03 Well GEJ paid a certain amount of the agreement.. 
And for your information the agreement started in 2009 before the spike in crude oil revenue
8763 2018-12-27 06:22:58 Oil isn't even the icing on the cake, it's just the cherry.
8764 2018-12-27 06:22:38 Pigs taste good to some. Love my bacon  but hate to see suckers. Interest rates will keep rising as oil roars back as well

8770 2018-12-27 06:21:56 There are most honest ways to critique him, but “oil money” isn’t one. Regardless, I am sorry for my harsh language. I will support the dem nominee whoever that is (hell I’d support a flaming piece of crap over a Trump) and I hope all sane Americans will do the same. /3

8772 2018-12-27 06:21:44 Yeah pepperoni is boring. I think that press you described sounds amazing! There's one I get in my town that is mozzarella, Alfredo sauce, chicken, Olive oil and basil. When you move beyond marinara the possibilities really open up
8773 2018-12-27 06:21:33 This is propaganda at its most subtle. They’re masking role of western powers in most of world conflicts in search of mineral wealth and oil to maintain their industries and lifestyle.

8782 2018-12-27 06:20:40 There is no political will to diversify. We are complacent with what we get from oil receipts.
Opportunities are abound in other sectors but our economic managers are not interested in maximizing the untapped potentials therein.

8785 2018-12-27 06:20:20 I don’t even like Beto all that much. But Sirota’s tweet about Beto taking “oil money” was misleading at best. Beto didn’t take money from PACs. The fact that a lot of people who work in Texas work for the oil industry isn’t news, and a lot of individuals donated to Beto. /2

8791 2018-12-27 06:19:54 Prime Minister Imran Khan has asked the authorities concerned to notify the ban on import of furnace oil and implement it with true spirit and instead generate the electricity from LNG and coal in future at the maximum.

8795 2018-12-27 06:19:26 I don’t think it’s about your youth, it’s about the concerns many have that “purity tests” are self destructive and often misleading.

I don’t think anyone thinks you are a Likkudist, but many think Beto’s “ties” to AIPAC and donations from oil workers (not corps) is analogous.

8814 2018-12-27 06:17:18 By banning oil, natural gas, gasoline, and coal they will be taking roughly $1.5 trillion yearly out of our economy. So are you saying you will replace $1.5 trillion with solar panels and windmill jobs? Get real .

8825 2018-12-27 06:16:15 For the same reasons you don't check the oil in your car every time you go somewhere. You're busy with other stuff and it still runs, so you put it off until later....and later again...and maybe next weekend you'll get to it.

8834 2018-12-27 06:14:47 It is not surprising at all. Since oil crisis in 1970s the UN is in the "fist" of the OPEC (mostly muslim countries) lobby. Energy is very good comodity for blackmailing countries that depend on it.

8887 2018-12-27 06:07:30 Not correct, there are numerous appropriate refineries in Gulf Coast, California, India and China that need heavy oil. Not to mention the petrochemical facilities using coal-to-liquids in China due to the shortage of heavy on the market. Coal-to-liquids have massive GHG emissions
8888 2018-12-27 06:06:59 My point: if they could increase oil benchmark in 2018 which resulted in inserting their projects and their allocation, then they should be patriotic enough in 2019 to reduce the benchmark and remove their projects and their allocation but leave out the capital projects.

But don't limit your hatred of hypocrisy  to me & the West, look at your own hypocrisy. Baha'i love peace, but you think Iran should hang them!
8905 2018-12-27 06:05:23 Once again, the whole reason the Trans Mountain approval was quashed was because there are concerns and gaps with shipping oil by oil tanker through Metro Vancouver and through Southern BC Coastal waters. Whether that’s from an expanded pipeline or right now.
8906 2018-12-27 06:05:17 Every country should stop purchasing oil and gas from Russia immediately. In fact, buy nothing from Russia until they leave Syria and Ukraine and give Crimea back. I’m sure there is a bunch of other stuff they should stop doing , but it’s a start.

8921 2018-12-27 06:03:06 Agreed. I blame Twitter for only allowing 4 choices. If you are into molecular gastronomy you can infuse some good oil w/ garlic and make a powder using tapioca maltodextrin.

8953 2018-12-27 05:57:31 Eric, for whatever reason, I can't hear you. Pretty sure it's all the spewing oil and burning, plus the subsequent loss of flora and fauna in the region that makes your signal difficult to follow.

8963 2018-12-27 05:55:53 Thx a lot. Do you think that a long term low in oil was struck in 2016 or will we go lower in 2019?

9024 2018-12-27 05:47:17 Musk: "We know we’ll run out of dead dinosaurs to mine for fuel & have to use sustainable energy eventually, ...go renewable now & avoid increasing risk of climate catastrophe? Betting that science is wrong & oil companies are right is the dumbest experiment in history by far."
9025 2018-12-27 05:47:09 No I didn't, but did  invent the oil? No. 
But  still uses it to pay buhari and osinbajo, to pay our 109 senators, to pay all the civil servants in .  uses it to run the goddamn country. Hustle in banking or hustle in d farm wot u will still risif is d oil .

9044 2018-12-27 05:44:49 Now it only makes sense that if Syria has oil Turkey has oil Iraq has oil Israel has oil that Palestine has oil also and if they could get along with anyone maybe Israel and others would not see them as a terrorism nation and help them get some oil independence at least and some

The US can send part of the bill to mexico and to other countries that have their people illegally entering the US. Nationalizing part of US oil can pay for it and the debt

Mix the egg white and lemon together and apply on the face. Let it dry then rinse off with warm water. Do this once every week. It reduces the oil in your skin, breakouts and acne scars become non existent.

In fact I can't think of any business in existence that doesn't have it's share of cheaters...insurance companies, auto repairs, of course lawyers; most politicians, many larger banks....cartels, diamonds are big time cheaters.

9123 2018-12-27 05:34:18 Alcohol kills brain cells, THC/CBD/CBN do not. If you come off of THC or CBN, take fish oil, and hydrate for a week, your cognitive functions return to you. Stoners on the other hand, people who stay high? They're dumber than a bag of bricks, but it is possible to recover.

9127 2018-12-27 05:33:41 All that oil underground wont be worth much once we transition to renewables. CC denial is just a stall so they can sell as much of it as possible before that happens.
9128 2018-12-27 05:33:40 79% of Republicans are racist, 16% of Americans lack a HS diploma and API claims 9.2 million are empoyed by oil and gas companies so no matter what he says or does there are those who will support him.
9129 2018-12-27 05:33:39 I'm sorry that was so easy for you. Beto raised 4x more than the next highest candidate in the whole country, but many of the funds came from outside Texas. Why would gas & oil interests outside Texas send money to Beto in the same proportion as other donors? You're a joke.

9179 2018-12-27 05:26:16 To be more accurate, there are grades of oil and as the grade increases it does increase in value. This is the case with many resources. The more substantial discounts currently are due to pipelines capacity, not grade.  You’re welcome.

9186 2018-12-27 05:25:25 It's easy. Esp fil food. Everything starts with sautéing onion and garlic in oil
9187 2018-12-27 05:25:17 So far it's nice! Pretty sure the scents I have are ok for pets, but to be safe I'm only putting a wee bit of oil in for a short amount of time in a room my animals stay out of

9197 2018-12-27 05:24:00 Not really. But the finger pointing at Alberta being the nation's big polluter is getting old. Oil will likely be around for another 100yrs at least. I think we deserve some credit for extracting this resource better & cleaner than the ones ding that finger pointing.

9203 2018-12-27 05:23:20 So... you think we can burn unlimited billions of tons of oil, without it having any effects on physical & chemical systems?

Yet you never sit in your running car in a closed garage.

Could it be you know it has  measurable effects on physical, chemical, & biological systems?

9207 2018-12-27 05:22:03 do u ever think like, how the profitability of oil companies relies on single use plastic, that is immediately discarded & replaced? And that oil companies actively fight improving municipal recycling efficency, so our need for plastic consumption, is met privately, not publicly?

9238 2018-12-27 05:16:48 The West has never supported the Azerbaijani people, and the West wants to get a share of the Azerbaijani oil with Aliyev. This is more important than democracy for them. They only have empty words.

9246 2018-12-27 05:15:39 There are numerous flaws in your article that betray your misunderstanding of how the crude markets operate. Heavy oil actually generates higher margins and less waste when refined in an appropriate refinery and is highly prized for petrochemical uses

9256 2018-12-27 05:13:59 I save it and use it in lieu of any other cooking oil.  Makes vegetables actually palatable.  But there's a secret use.  You have leftover fries (or, ahem, chips).  Throw them in the oven or in a pan with some bacon fat.  It revitalizes them.  Makes them savory as all get out.
9257 2018-12-27 05:13:39 The idea, of benchmarking the Budget against oil prices the Govt has no control over, is a major flaw in budget planning, and too ambitious.

9281 2018-12-27 05:11:14 OK, but we should probably have a plan in place for how a world without vehicles and 60% less electricity will operate. This is setting aside the oil in plastic and the coal in steel.

9439 2018-12-27 04:49:00 Can’t produce oil without producing gas, but there is no pipeline for the gas. They allow the gas to be flared so that oil can be produced, but expect the industry to get busy laying pipelines.

9442 2018-12-27 04:48:22 @BetoORourke please address the oil money thing. Is it real or fake? What were the circumstances and amounts if so?
9443 2018-12-27 04:47:54 Katanya kalo abis lepas krim dokter jgn pake apa2 dulu gitu, cuma pake fw sama first cleanser yg cocok. Gua kemaren abis lepas lgsg pake skincare apa aja malah makin ancur, skrg lg coba pake fw sama cleansing oil aja agak mendingan.
9444 2018-12-27 04:47:39 I think it’s like cooking them in a little butter or oil till they’re kind of limp but still moist, not dried out.
9445 2018-12-27 04:47:32 I am NOT ok when I found out about YL EO contain lead? For goodness sake, LEAD???! Oh god. Gonna ban you guys for selling birth defect-causing oil!
9446 2018-12-27 04:47:30 He helped vote down legislation to prevent drilling in the E Gulf of Mexico,  one of only a few Dems to vote to lift the 40-yr old oil export ban, he also has a spotty record on Wall Street regulation and healthcare
9447 2018-12-27 04:47:29 Gas transportation is a problem in areas like Bakken (ND) and Eagle Ford (TX) where unconventional oil development has outpaced gas pipeline infrastructure.
9448 2018-12-27 04:47:23 Trump likes Iraq because he believes we can take their oil...Afganistan and Syria has no natural resources he wants!
9449 2018-12-27 04:47:11 But make sure where ever you go you use a bicycle right? And power everything by the sun even during the winter time and oil is bad and if you don’t get your way have a temper tantrum and yell and scream good job Liz
9450 2018-12-27 04:47:07 Realised that we had left a wash in the washing machine for a week (?!), burnt my hand touching the boiling kettle and broke a bottle of chilly oil. Working-ish on this cursed week between Christmas and NYE is going splendidly.
9451 2018-12-27 04:46:58 Of course it's a deliberate destruction of the industry. How else do you explain putting a soldier that can barely read in charge of the biggest oil reserves on earth?

9454 2018-12-27 04:46:44 Climate change is not a great Twitter topic. UN-recommended $250/gallon gas tax would certainly make national debt worse. Reducing reliance on foreign oil is easy, develop alternatives & drill more @ home. Should reduce reliance on oil for the environment, if for no other reason.

9456 2018-12-27 04:46:35 The Fed's biggest concern is inflation. It's the reason they're raising rates. The price of oil - the biggest contributor to the inflation rate - has dropped significantly. If inflation is below 1.7%, the Fed Chair should resign, as he's unnecessarily caused market instability.

9473 2018-12-27 04:44:28 Beto pledged not to take $ from oil execs and then broke that pledge. Sirota and Kotch’s reporting exposed this and also laid out Beto’s actual voting record on issues of interest to oil companies. You just don’t like the facts coming to light.
9474 2018-12-27 04:44:24 You can usually find an olive loaf in one of the nice-ish grocery stores (albertsons and HEB usually have them, trader joe’s and Whole Foods almost definitely do -maaaybe target?). Then you can just warm it and dip it in some olive oil with herbs of your choice.
9475 2018-12-27 04:44:17 This is apples to apples.  You claimed Canadian oil companies don’t receive subsidies.  They in fact receive the highest amount of subsidies in the G7.

9513 2018-12-27 04:40:14 No sht! Now he’s messing with us 1-2kers. Remember Ma Bell, Standard oil, the 3 networks. These companies must either adhere to both antitrust and FCC rules or they need to be exposed to lawsuits for libel, discrimination, etc. because they control content. 
9514 2018-12-27 04:40:12 He probably gone wash it and take it for a oil change
9515 2018-12-27 04:40:08  Greasy/ oily Hair

- don’t overuse oil (use only 1 - 2 times a week) 
- conditions ONLY your ends 
- Try not using the straightener 
- use dry shampoo if needed 
- avoid heat.

9528 2018-12-27 04:38:53 Iya bisaaa itu. Cuma pake nya jadi sebelum fash wash atau sesudahnya(?) /bingung sendiri/

9533 2018-12-27 04:37:57 Problem is that Northern Alberta is being targeted by campaigns attempting to anger, scare and ‘nationalize’.  Oil’s low cost & cancelled pipeline have caused some real suffering.  Then Opportunists move in and offer up someone to blame, fear and hate.  Dangerous Conservatives.

9539 2018-12-27 04:37:23 Yes. That is what I heard also regarding alleged Big Oil donations to Beto. It's these multitudes of details that we are going to have to sort through for 20 or so candidates that make it so important that we start early.  We're on Trump removal time so we can't lose a moment!
9540 2018-12-27 04:37:03 And, remember, Texas is full of ppl who work in oil industry (CEOs, oil field, offshore, secretaries, project mgrs, engineers, accting, warehousing, sales…), so that he rec'd any amt from oil ind employees in his run for Sen, is not a surprise at all to anyone living in TX. 
9541 2018-12-27 04:37:01 Canola and conveyors don't mix. Two issues: the canola oil reacts with the the rubber in the belt and shrinks it, also the canola collects on the rollers. This is why mfr's void warranty w/canola. Brandt even has a decal on their conveyor saying this. @AGIHOPPY780

9561 2018-12-27 04:33:49 Hold on to your hats, the gov. may think of new ways of making up for the loss in oil revenue by taxing the people.
9562 2018-12-27 04:33:37 I used to think a great Us leader was one who engendered trust in the dollar and hope for world peace. That is no longer the case. Now we need a leader that will lead us to a future we can breathe in and oil isn’t going to pay for that
9563 2018-12-27 04:33:36 I took like half the recommended amt of CBD oil and I’m so fkn chilled out. Is this what not having anxiety is like?
9564 2018-12-27 04:33:36 I didn’t have a problem with her until she became the head of Snake Oil Inc. aka Goop.  Some of what she’s selling is downright dangerous.
9565 2018-12-27 04:33:15 Keystone pipeline, drilling for Aaron oil, doing our own fracking, lead in the world in oil, export, fair trade, balanced tariffs, deals with Canada deal is it Mexico wow the list goes on and on. Must be breaking your heart!

9567 2018-12-27 04:33:00  Dry Hair 

- coconut oil.
- Jojoba oil.
- don’t use too many products with chemical and especially alcohol or sulfate. 
- wash your hair 2 - 3 times a week 
- wash your hair with COLD water always. 
- Switch your hair brush to a natural bristled brush.
- Don’t use heat.
9568 2018-12-27 04:32:56 You are repeating Bernie supporters talking point. The "Big Oil" was from indv. pacs from employees inside the Company's, Individual donations.

9589 2018-12-27 04:29:11 The US abandoned them once before when they were fighting against Saddams invasion of Kuwait. Then the US gave Saddam chemical weapons and he used them on the Kurds and the US bailed so they could have Iraqs oil..

9598 2018-12-27 04:28:21 I usually do it the other way around. Fry onions etc and then add spices. Let me try this way too. Makes sense I guess, the oil should absorb the flavors from the spices better this way. Thanks!

9605 2018-12-27 04:27:02 I understand them. It's not my specialization, nor is it yours. 3) None of the pieces you listed pertain to the types of points raised by the article. 4) With oil prices low again and demand slowdown globally, even tighter sanctions scrutiny would be moronic.

9715 2018-12-27 04:13:03 That’s all fine and dandy Chuck, but when you have become one of the largest oil producers in the world, cheap oil can actually hurt the economy.

9725 2018-12-27 04:12:15 Not behind on times but in delivery it’s difficult. Every time I have to call & ask about ingredients. I feel it’s easier to make it at home. Things like they call fries, vegan or vegetarian when it’s fried in the same oil as seafood or meat, they don’t know if it matters.

9727 2018-12-27 04:11:58 And will change again next year. And year after. That’s an argument for insulating oneself against oil price volatility, which has been increasing. It’s wise not to make a purchase you’ll use for 10+ years based on today’s price. And yet SUV sales still soar when prices drop.
9728 2018-12-27 04:11:46 nah it's definitely just cbd oil, i got it at this woo woo ~*~*spiritual shop*~**~. it's probably just that i took so much and also drank a glass of wine!

9736 2018-12-27 04:10:28 Our local Colorado Springs News app goes off all day & night long w/ alerts about major car accidents. Here, they don't just smoke weed, they vape oil and wax which gets you way much higher because of the concentration. I was pro-cannabis legalization, but it destroyed Colorado

9743 2018-12-27 04:09:57 Can remember under the Cons when oil prices dropped jobs put on hold and most got the toe.
9744 2018-12-27 04:09:47 the question you raise is interesting. a parralell is at the infancy of the oil industry it was the drillers that made money.

but very quickly rockerfellar used distribution (shipping, barrelling, pipelines) to gain monopoly over the industry.

9746 2018-12-27 04:09:32 If you’re in the oil field or know someone who is let them know this tip. When you go wash your oily clothes add Coca Cola before adding your laundry detergent. Helps get rid of the oil.
9747 2018-12-27 04:09:23 Then, just dice the white onions, then cut the white mushrooms into strips. Again, this helps with texture and flavor diffusion.

I place the Mushrooms into the marinara, then sautee the garlic and onions in some olive oil with a touch of red wine.
9748 2018-12-27 04:09:20 To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it

9752 2018-12-27 04:09:02 Bullshit...the oil market has collapsed... that's the reason for low prices...liar
9753 2018-12-27 04:08:55 Yeah. We re so lucky not to have any oil reserves. Still,we re in the "not so comfy area" of the world according to the Rumsfeld-Cebrowsky doctrine. In the meantime,we count our blessings and pray for the best while bracing for the worst.
9754 2018-12-27 04:08:54 Just like how obama said he was responsible for the oil boom,and the ceo  or some big shot of Shell told him he was tslking bull shit.
9755 2018-12-27 04:08:35 Frank is the master oil, it heals a lot. Lavender would come a close second. Personally, I’d use copiaba oil for inflammation

9769 2018-12-27 04:07:10 Slave? Who said anything about being a slave. He gets paid for his work. From voting to Increase the area allowed to drill in the gulf, to voting to repeal the prohibition on oil exports.  Yes 75 Gees ain't much but he's a cheap date.
9770 2018-12-27 04:07:07 Canadian fossil fuel companies get billions in subsidies.
According to your own CBC News: Canadian taxpayers are on the hook for somewhere between $7.7 billion and $15 billion in recent initiatives to support for the oil and gas industry.
9771 2018-12-27 04:07:07 Each time I look at some people comments here I feel like crying within myself. In Nigeria ministers record so far PMB is the only person without an oil blocks allocated to himself when he was a petroleum minister. ATIKU worked once all government companies converted to his own.

9775 2018-12-27 04:06:51 He broke his pledge to not take fossil fuel money.  He was recently removed from the websites list of candidates who pledged not to take fossil fuel money.

9852 2018-12-27 03:58:57 Gasoline is a refined product...  Alaskan oil is shipped to refineries, then back.   If they had a local refinery it would vastly reduce the price. But, nimby rules.
9853 2018-12-27 03:58:50 Yest I sent a random man a lunch invitation by mistake. And like all patriotic Pakistanis he didn’t mind and was willing to come anyway.

9855 2018-12-27 03:58:36 I realize oil is one stock option, but you can still base the stock market off of that, it’s one of the closest things we have to base it off of. I read and listen to plenty, especially on both sides, so I’m not biased.

9860 2018-12-27 03:58:14 I'm sure you fill up your car with oil that we import from Saudi Arabia. If you want a majority government let's start supporting  Canada's  oil in our own country. It's going to take time to change our cars to electric so why make Canada suffer during that time.

9862 2018-12-27 03:58:07 Takes a lot more than money to operate heavy oil fields like those in Venz

9864 2018-12-27 03:58:02 I like it. After i use that i moisturize with tea tree oil and cocoa butter stick
9865 2018-12-27 03:57:59 The first oil embargo almost destroyed the US economy.
A second one probably would have.
That doesn't excuse us calling Israel "our greatest ally" tho.  They're more like the North Korea to our China.

9867 2018-12-27 03:57:51 I hope they are oil rich Saudis. Where is the UN hiding these guys? Will they be arriving by boat, plane,mule trains?
9868 2018-12-27 03:57:46 Perhaps the foreign country owned corporation is whatever that oil company is that Russia owns. The one that had some secret exchange happen?

9873 2018-12-27 03:57:14 Oreos are technically vegan, but since they use palm oil from a non environmental friendly (that's not the correct term, but can't remember the right one) supplier, some vegans would not consider Oreos as vegan.

9875 2018-12-27 03:56:57 The point is not be run exactly like Norway or that Norway is the best system. The point is Alberta is not an oil producing country. Therefore it makes no sence to compare Alberta to Norway or any other oil producing country. Canis the producer and is responsible for the mess
9876 2018-12-27 03:56:57 Being skeptical of Betos voting to expand oil production while raking in exec fossil fuel donations to combat the looming climate crisis is not about ideas. I have worms in my brain.

9877 2018-12-27 03:56:40 gotta pack tonight for deca, get my oil change, and close tomorrow. we love festivals
9878 2018-12-27 03:56:40 guys, my anecdotal insight (a partner from Grizzle is from Calgary) - it feels like the flat lining happened a couple years back with the last oil correction, I’m no where near close enough to understand fully. How long would a typical house stay on the mkt before selling?
9879 2018-12-27 03:56:39 @TopVelocity Why change it if it’s true?  You’ve got 50+ documented testimonials to prove it.  But you’ve claimed 1000’s have been through your program...do the math !!!!  Brent is a snake oil salesmen

After pressure from civil society Ecuador’s government agreed not to allow oil drilling in its "buffer zone" protected areas!

9884 2018-12-27 03:55:55 Who's being missleading here? Many of those"employees" happen to be Oil executives. Over 30 to be exact, and said executives donated the maximum allowed amount of  2,500. They don't give money away without expecting a return.
9885 2018-12-27 03:55:41 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.
9886 2018-12-27 03:55:40 Another fact is that,the govt is even negotiating on the agreements reached with the past @OfficialPDPNig govt and they're yet to claim this as part of their achievements 
They reached these agreements when we were selling oil at higher price and equally borrowed.
9887 2018-12-27 03:55:31 Can you still say this after 50 years when their oil reserves have dried??

9891 2018-12-27 03:55:04 I don’t think you realize what you’re actually talking about. I don’t see how I’m being ignorant here. I believe you’re the one that needs to look up stuff other then by the biased media. For the most part you can base off the stock market on the price of barrels of oil.

9895 2018-12-27 03:54:52 Hilarious  
Reminds me of a friend’s story. He was dating a girl who’s dad was CEO of a oil Corp and the dad had Cheney over for drinks before he was VP. My friend met him and told me he got the feel Cheney would stab his own grandma in the back for a dollar. A real creep.

9905 2018-12-27 03:53:35 What happened to all those money looted from us through high oil prices?? Or do one thing deduct 5rs from the 15 lacs while depositing in our bank account.
9906 2018-12-27 03:53:23 white rice is healthier. also, if you cook white rice with coconut oil and let it sit overnight its glycemic index goes down 13 points. 
so it'd be great if someone made non-wheat crackers with white rice, not brown rice.
9907 2018-12-27 03:53:11  Im done with Bush normalization, as if he’s a sweet pea, oil painting, candy dole-ing,  president during “normal times.” Bush set the precedent for Trump today: he lied to us about WMD’s, and Trump even quoted “enemy combatants,” during his SOTU and no one even noticed

9943 2018-12-27 03:48:27 Yeah keep those oil wells open so you can have more earthquakes and more pollution of water. Make sure you sell Alaska to the highest bidder just like this president. Don't leave any animals behind
9944 2018-12-27 03:47:42 5-year spreads are 1.57%- even 30 year spreads only 1.85%. That ain’t oil prices.

9966 2018-12-27 03:45:35 Sorry, Not sure what this means? My comment does not mention political parties. Just that we are always compared to oil producing countries but in fact Alberta is not.
