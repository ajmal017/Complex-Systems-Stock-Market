41 2018-12-20 22:36:38 I don’t think that is the solution.  I think the Fed will start printing money to pay debt.  It will cause inflation of the US dollar.  It will be critical that world markets continue to price oil and other commodities in dollars to help hedge the inflation.  Reason why everyone
42 2018-12-20 22:34:37 There is no inflation in commodities and wage growth is largely due to a labor shortage which we could fix some intelligent immigration reform. When you have record Corp profits there is plenty of room for wages to eat into Corp profits.

44 2018-12-20 22:30:03 #Hemp is legal because large AG corporations want it that way. Unless you own a couple hundred acres U probably won't get a contract to grow hemp for the open market. Speaking of' what market will American hemp be sold in? Will it be bought and sold by US commodities markets?
45 2018-12-20 22:26:45 Trade war and tariffs should be inflationary and good for commodities/gold/wages and bad for emerging markets and corporate gross margins imo. Could ultimately be good for the economy though if wages rise. Barring a real war/tax change I don’t think politics has much impact.

70 2018-12-20 20:17:30 No of course look what has happened tonight...But the USD index is weaker again and commodities like copper and gold are up, Was also short twice tonight got caught on the second but luckily only a small loss.this is the game and the enemy seems to have much more information ..
71 2018-12-20 20:15:08 Rarely in the history of financial markets since the 20th century, the central bankers have raised interest rates when the commodities index is down more than 15% from its top. US Fed chairman's recent guidance is the straw that has clearly broken the camel's back.

106 2018-12-20 18:29:23 Economy doesn’t turn around in 90 days.  Neither do commodities.  You need to be patient and give this more than a year at minimum.

115 2018-12-20 18:00:50 Undocumented immigrants pay about $11.6 billion a year in taxes. The money they pay for housing, food & other commodities adds billions more to the economy.  Reducing the undocumented labor force would also raise costs for their employers with those increases passed on to us.

118 2018-12-20 17:58:50 With a weak dollar you'd think commodities would trade better. They act like death!
119 2018-12-20 17:58:28 QE 4 is on the pipeline. Gold and commodities will enter bull market!
120 2018-12-20 17:50:44 Value in terms of access to real-world commodities that is — even a fiat-abstracted world
121 2018-12-20 17:42:21 sleep is one of the most underrated commodities one could have
122 2018-12-20 17:41:58 This is what we want from our Labour MPS Laura. Passionate, commodities sense people who are obviously caring and local to the constituencies they represent. The days of parachuted Oxbridge ‘moderates’ who have been favoured above well liked, popular socialist locals are over
123 2018-12-20 17:29:22 Farmers don't have rights to fix price for Thier commodities like industrialists .
Else we would have generated more than IT companion.
124 2018-12-20 17:26:43 CM Punjab Mr Usman Buzdar seems an inactive person .He should form commeties to check artificial hike in the commodities of daily use items which are used by a common man.Traders should be arrested who are responsible for prices hike under NS orders .
125 2018-12-20 17:25:40 Interesting..given what's happened to commodities, would you have expected long end to come in more?
126 2018-12-20 17:20:31 insecurities aren't securities: commodities to trade, exchanged, valued or devalued. why contemporary money is accepted as is, then, other than means to exchange value, but universal value itself. what happens when most people eventually realized that believing in money is stupid
127 2018-12-20 17:19:29 Egypt’s the General Authority for Supply Commodities (GASC), said it bought 120,000 tonnes of wheat in its latest tender, including 60,000 tonnes of Ukrainian wheat and 60,000 tonnes of Romanian wheat.
128 2018-12-20 17:12:55 In her article on Michael Bennett, Louisa Thomas refers to "a crop of young quarterbacks," thereby demonstrating Bennett's critique that football treats players as property. Passive commodities to be sown & sold.

131 2018-12-20 17:05:12 IPL auctions are brazenly crass & inhuman. Cricket players are treated like cattles & commodities. Auction system in sports are prevalent only in India&not in any other nations. That's why Indians are global laughing stock in sports.its like cattle trading. Draft system is best.
132 2018-12-20 17:04:12 "Stop making ‘art’ and start making your work. […] It’s so easy to make things that look like art, act like art, get sold like art, yet in the end aren’t really art, but are phantoms, mere commodities, or quantifiable digestible sound bites.”

133 2018-12-20 17:03:28 @FinMinIndia @ncdex in the present situation where government has procured huge quantity of of pulses and wheat, i think govt can procure more crops and distribute them through FCI. In this  govt should ban future trading in agri commodities. It is a casino.
134 2018-12-20 17:01:02 IWC has never been about preservation. The moratorium changed catch limits to 0, but never amended the treaty language about the "orderly development of the whaling industry." In the eyes of the law, they are commodities.
135 2018-12-20 16:59:59 So money will be leaving stocks and going into commodities when??
136 2018-12-20 16:58:53 Bears keep clawing away at the price of oil! Wednesday report from the EIA shows a larger than expected increase in both crude stockpiles and distillates, implying an ongoing oversupply. Will $40 be the next destination for WTI prices?

137 2018-12-20 16:58:18 Value of the commodities change to the Russian currency.. how will that effect the value of our dollar.. how will that then effect our stock market..I'm guessing your money is in Russia..since I suspect we are headed for a collapse..you are a traitor..you sold my country Demon!
138 2018-12-20 16:57:39 well, okay I was being defensive but you'd be surprised at the lenghts  stans get to bash on different opinions so I am very cautious, sorry there.
but then, what is there to discuss I wonder? BMC's point is "women are written as commodities in shonen and that's not acceptable
139 2018-12-20 16:50:08 just checked a few "real" numbers -- YTD real imports of capital and consumer goods are both up ~ 8.5%.   above IMF's estimate for real goods trade growth.  Growth in imports of industrial supplies (commodities, steel) is up only 1%.
140 2018-12-20 16:46:14 @IGGYAZALEA They love words of validation. Confidence is thy nuke. In confidence i acted like i was discontent and ripped apart. I call it altruist commadeer. Then so count the commodities. Aquaint to all acommadation. Know thy galore.
141 2018-12-20 16:45:00 A polycule so massive their fund for small household items massively disrupts the commodities markets. They're declared too big to fail.
142 2018-12-20 16:44:02 It’s a signature characteristic of industrialized capitalism that basically everyone on earth has to consume commodities produced by capitalism. I don’t think I’m more pure than anyone else, I just believe working to end capitalism is a necessity for humanity.
143 2018-12-20 16:42:16 Bloomberg now: ”What’s the outlook on Gold?”
- All the reasons to buy the Dollar are now off the table. Prec. metals+commodities could provide an attractive alternative - the interest in Gold has been very low lately, and an increase in that interest could provide strong pressure
144 2018-12-20 16:41:42 National teams are in the business of winning and they play their cards according to what is best at a particular time, not always what’s best for the players. IMO today’s players are treated as commodities to be exploited and benefited from.
145 2018-12-20 16:36:31 Cuando los precios de los commodities se ven afectados a la baja, no hay forma alguna en que la economía pueda desplegar mecanismos anticíclicos y, por lo tanto, difícilmente será posible sostener así una senda de crecimiento.
146 2018-12-20 16:29:09 Tell that to the Castro regime. Doctors, baseball players are commodities for the Castro family.
147 2018-12-20 16:22:33 We will have plenty of ex it sting rail infrastructure when they dont have to carry bulk commodities related to livestock.

162 2018-12-20 15:42:51 Food stamps don’t just help the poor. The program also ensures commodities market stability that helps farmers and, curiously, commodities futures brokers. Most of the margins associated with agriculture go to the brokers and others in the financial community.

165 2018-12-20 15:33:02 Then why you ask? If you don’t care then stick with what you’re given 
One thing is to be upset and another is to expect better, writing women as commodities and extras is not good writing mate, not anymore, so next time we say we don’t think these series are perfect, let us be
166 2018-12-20 15:33:00 How much was the price of commodities before PMB? All of u defending failure re paid to do so. I am a Nigerian I don't need to be paid cos I am feeling d effect of bad Economic policies
167 2018-12-20 15:32:25 Global CB’s stopped buying our debt 4 yrs ago, and began buying true “risk free” assets in light of the supply of USDs that must come w entitlement spending: Gold, commodities, & other real assets.

170 2018-12-20 15:28:00 Relations between #Israel and #central_Asia and #caucuses states are exaggerated by the Israeli media outlets. Information that commodities turnover between Israel and a number of these countries is being measured in billions is also untrue, in reality this figure is much lower.
171 2018-12-20 15:26:27 Wisdom   character ( integrity) and values ( self belief / contentment’s) are scarce commodities  in #Gambia
172 2018-12-20 15:25:51 Not better but Dabo thinks we are simply different, don't treat players as commodities, etc. It has worked in that we literally don't have any decommitments anymore. We are 100% committed to the players & expect the same in return. Means we have to pass on some good players too.
173 2018-12-20 15:25:11 "O dinheiro é uma mercadoria... não um token inútil só bom para a troca;... Difere de outras commodities em ser exigido principalmente como um meio de troca."

175 2018-12-20 15:15:53 We the lower middle class are unable to cope up with increased price of all essential commodities.

177 2018-12-20 15:14:15 As the rest of the world gets bigger, the US becomes a major exporter of commodities, as the marginal buyer will have shifted to Asia. Already happened in oil. US cultural artefacts become prized for their authenticity and story (happening with university degrees).

179 2018-12-20 15:03:54 They still are looting resources, undermining countries' ability to feed their own people, by forcing them to import bulk Ag commodities in return for oil. 
Shocking that Nigeria with vast arable land should be net importer of rice.
180 2018-12-20 15:01:36 IQueues I think Zimbabwe leads at the moment - fuel, money, basic commodities- all that - how much of our productive time we spend in queues? Lots
181 2018-12-20 14:56:04 Read Inikori’s Africans and the Industrial Revolution in England. Capitalism was founded on slavery and relied on it to produce cheap and often addictive commodities for the global marketplace.
182 2018-12-20 14:54:09 This idiot wants to use football as an argument against racism? Where a small group of wealthy owners trade athletes back and forth like commodities? Really? Really?
183 2018-12-20 14:48:08 It has.

The tax has scrapped businesses, destroyed families, etc.  In turn we can't afford gas, commodities, etc, which all produces co2.  Carbon Tax extremely effective!

My prediction: dollar weakens, commodities bottom, international markets improve & risk-on trade returns. USD slide will confirm.
193 2018-12-20 14:12:08 There has been major disconnect between govt economic data & reality/corp results for some time, but this is new levels of disparity.  All markets (stocks, bonds, commodities) moving opposite what the clueless spewing.  #markets #economy #Fed

195 2018-12-20 14:03:36 The curse of economies that depend on oil or other key commodities. The gulf states became wiser, they know what's coming and diversified their economies. Sudan is in for even worse times ahead. Angola, Nigeria, are you listening?
196 2018-12-20 14:02:13 Honest tax & EMI payers will get abused. Misuse center's grant/assistance funds. They will raise prices of essential commodities & fuel. Thr4 cause food inflation, inflation in real estate prices->rentals->goods n services->interest rates->loan EMIs.
Banks NPAs will arise again.

198 2018-12-20 13:54:20 Just before I left to work in Sydney I recall, amusingly, some young local men whinging about the cost of fuel & other commodities required to be transported from Sydney. I said, ‘Well if you don’t wish to pay the extra, move there’. Response, ‘What, live in that f’n rat race?’..
199 2018-12-20 13:51:00 stop online shopping & support your local stores, cheap commodities comes at someone else’s cost and it isn’t the capitalist, everyone wants equality but doesn’t understand they hold the power with how they spend their dollar.

I expect a fairly large  Dow/S&P500 rally to take hold soon, Oil will recover fairly well  along with that.
DXY seems to have put in a LT bottom probably, that will be a good tail wind for all commodities.
204 2018-12-20 13:18:57 1. No IT up to 10 lac. 2. Abolition of sec 370. 3. Arrange govt purchase of all commodities having MSP. 4. Take steps to reform education system.

206 2018-12-20 13:15:21 My early 2000 does not precisely mean year 2000. One, if not best of the ways to control commodities inflation/CPI is to have functional price control board which will guide against arbitrary price in the market.

210 2018-12-20 12:56:18 No end to ur lie. U r advocating for singal 18%GST for all goods & service. Where as Modiji sticking on 4 slab very sensibly even today.

I may be wrong, nobody around who can advise me ...
215 2018-12-20 12:33:52 Even if Economy was in shambles and the previous Governments were responsible for the current cash crunch, PTI must come with an out of box solution for increase in daily commodities as poor and middle class is unable to digest the reason (s)
216 2018-12-20 12:31:04 Dollar Index $DXY has topped out on a multi year basis IMO. Even if it bounces a bit for a week,  unlikely to cross 97.80 in any case.

217 2018-12-20 12:18:17 U can chk the inflation rates..it has been in control for 4 yrs..and the prices of basic commodity never went up..like rice,wheat,dal,pulses etc. Still I remember paying the same price in 2014 for all the basic commodities

220 2018-12-20 11:54:10 Assuming? I proposed a hypothetical... There are many examples of people profiting and earning money, by just having money.  It’s not always the case that they work for it.  Take for example speculators in commodities.
221 2018-12-20 11:48:17 Precisely - for me it’s always bigger picture first. All about going in with conviction when #AiM index & chosen commodities have at least stabilised (ideally uptrend).

222 2018-12-20 11:28:15 TSX Venture Exchange down over 41% since high of early this year. It's prices as if we may never need to explore for commodities or need risk capital again.

224 2018-12-20 11:14:16 In commodities, oil prices plunged, resuming declines seen earlier in the week amid worries about oversupply and the outlook for the global economy.

1) Blood and

234 2018-12-20 10:08:10 Unless your fetish is for commodities then GET OOT
235 2018-12-20 10:07:20 Like all valuable commodities, truth is often counterfeited.
236 2018-12-20 09:53:00 now a days all market products is listed as basic necessity and commodities in a house hold so profit becomes bouncy and flexible
237 2018-12-20 09:52:34 Modiji should apply the simple slab of "Pitchees" percent & rename GST to PPT i.e. Pappu Pitchees Tax. Will that suffice? Height of stupidity that he looks at 18% slab though Modiji has negated those level on several essential commodities & dinning out.  "Grand Stupid Thought"
238 2018-12-20 09:46:06 Thanks sir.
Very useful stuff.
My take away was the one between brand and commodities. Brands operate on emotional level while commodities operate on price / availability level

240 2018-12-20 09:40:09 USD  index weaker,probably good for ZAR , commodities  ,gold cpper oil up. #ALSI up
241 2018-12-20 09:30:55 The word capped is an add on. He wanted all commodities to have a GST of 18%
242 2018-12-20 09:26:08 Nonsense..

28% remain for few commodities. And shifting some commodities from 28 to 18 , how it's going to be simpler?  U were suggesting single percentage regime which is illogical in this country.  Before tweeting show Ur tweet to someone who understand it.
243 2018-12-20 09:11:17 It looks like every market function is broken now. Commodities are all down, oil crash, but US dollar down as well.
Risk-off in equity market but Aud/usd bounce and nzd gdp is huge misss, but doing welll
244 2018-12-20 09:09:12 If proper rate is give to our commodities we can repay our debits we don't need any cancellations of debits
245 2018-12-20 09:08:26 When you think of people as tradable commodities then you really get the jist of the Tory mindset

247 2018-12-20 08:53:53 Most of the products we use in our lives are commodities. It's ineffecient to have like six toothpaste Vendors, or three brands of toilet paper. I look to Kirkland Signature here which makes all sorts of stuff from steaks to shoes to batteries. I want brands to not matter
248 2018-12-20 08:48:24 Do u know what @RahulGandhi advocated ? He wanted only 1  tax @18%, not a rate capped @18% and no 28% tax. This means that essential commodities being taxed @5% and luxury cars and sin goods would be taxed at 18%. But then, psychophants rarely think and understand, they parrot.

250 2018-12-20 08:44:23 When Buhari increased the price for crude oil to 140. Subsidy was zero and we were basically paying market price at that time. 

Once we understand that government does not interfere in the price, we will accept it. We don't have subsidy expectations on other commodities
251 2018-12-20 08:42:00 So christmas is time for joy and celebrations but if some commodities are expensive then you don't have to spend all you have,remember blue January comes with debts.Spend Wisely
252 2018-12-20 08:26:41 Lool I keep asking are we still talking about human beings or commodities??!!
253 2018-12-20 08:24:14 Commodities: Gold gained 0.52pc to $1,255.20 while Brent added 0.72pc to $57.55
254 2018-12-20 08:20:10 Hehehe . Ever heard of a rich farmer (except amitabh) ? 
Whatever the govt gives free , it steals via dumb policies like MSP and essential commodities act etc
255 2018-12-20 08:11:33 पहले 97% सामानों पर GST 18 फीसदी या उससे कम था, अब 99% पे होगा। आपको यह भी बताना चाहिये की जो 2 % नये सामान जुड़े है उनमे से कितने सामान essential commodities मे आते थे।
256 2018-12-20 08:03:07 Completely agree. Markets weren't that right in 2015/2016 slowdown. Oil/commodities price action for instance, overshot greatly to the downside.

Druck also talked about how price action signals now are less reliable than they used to due to algos' role.

264 2018-12-20 07:21:38 We also have tariffs, collapsing industrial commodities, falling long interest rates & strong US$  further restricting domestic exports.  All deflationary.  QT is plenty, it was experimental and should be unwound with respect & definitely not simultaneously raising short rates
265 2018-12-20 07:20:14 It is highest time that plastics throw-away commodities get banned. I fully support this decision by the Commision.
266 2018-12-20 07:07:57 If salaries are increased, prices of commodities will increase and it won't make the money value have any meaning. Why can't government make prices of food go down extremely low? Other things might be luxury. Food is important
267 2018-12-20 07:04:26 I always remember a news letter saying don’t worry it’s only related to financials and that commodities and China would not be affected, then there was a bloodbath in resources...
268 2018-12-20 07:00:22 The Chinese now have solar driven ships for transport of commodities. They are working on producing steel production from renewables too. That includes not using coaking coal.
269 2018-12-20 06:56:44 Dear @MBuhari and @ProfOsinbajo ,are you aware a bag of rice now cost above 22k? How do expect the beneficial of @Trader_Moni to use this money judiciously with inflation of basic commodities? They'll simply use it to feed and go back to being poor. We need stable economy please.
270 2018-12-20 06:42:32 The reason is simple.. Because indian female actors have no shame... They are happy playing commodities in films... They are happy getting paid way below male actors... 
271 2018-12-20 06:42:08 Rice,dal, medicines & other essential commodities price are same. Still there is black money. Getting a cheaper internet is not acche din. People want Food to live not internet!
272 2018-12-20 06:39:50 I'd be buying if I had more cash available. Yes the market is going down eventually but not yet. This reminds me of late 2006 and commodities were still warming up
273 2018-12-20 06:37:07 Commodities
Brent Crude▼ -1.66% at 56.29Comex Gold▼ -0.71% at 1,243.20
Copper▼ -1.93% at 2.67Crude Oil▼ -2.26% at 47.08
274 2018-12-20 06:31:14 Not only the sudden surge is controlled but also the prices (inflation adjusted) of essential commodities are far below the pre 2014 levels.
275 2018-12-20 06:29:08 Robotic statement.  Phillips curve has been dead for decades he just doesn’t know it.  The last two times short rates were pushed above 5% inflation wasn’t the problem (00&06) Its not now either. Tariffs,tight monetary policy, collapsing industrial commodities looks like 1931
276 2018-12-20 06:18:13 Like I said we are in this together.... About commodities we are talking about it not because we can compare with an old price.

As for unemployment, a micro economy like ours is bound to suffer if our main stay can not sustain us.
277 2018-12-20 06:13:53 One of the most precious commodities you have is time.
Plan your time well, use it in the most productive and efficient way.

279 2018-12-20 06:03:38 You mean lower prices of commodities was enjoyed by only those who stole? Are you aware that unemployment figures have grown by 3 million this year?
280 2018-12-20 05:48:07 @narendramodi 
Dear Sir,
Say no to
Farm loan waiver
Don't make our economy defaulters economy. Let light headed politicians talk what they want. You keep up your good work of development.
MSP for commodities with distress price a better option for farmers

282 2018-12-20 05:30:25 So inflation is down over all, but for commodities such as meat it has increased? I think the headline needs a little clean up, it’s kinda confusing.
283 2018-12-20 05:07:54 Crude oil is falling once more after very brief recovery.  Short-lived bullish bounce strongly implies a lack of market volumes.

284 2018-12-20 05:00:01 Commodities: Copper -2.35%, Brent -1.87%
285 2018-12-20 04:58:56 While everyone says #crypto is dead -- "#Bitcoin is dead," wrote one -- the major stock market indeces and commodities markets are plunging. Call that "The Bonfire of the Equities."
286 2018-12-20 04:53:50 Although I agree with u that salaries need not be pegged against the US$ there needs to be economic justice. A re- evaluation of the salary structure needs to be undertaken. Coz right now people r taking home peanuts in comparison to basic commodities.
287 2018-12-20 04:48:51 An ass. The rate increase is more political than financial. Absolutely no reason for it considering commodities are in a deflationary cycle. Gold, sliver, etc all down. Serious oil glut, price down in then 30s from high in its 70s. Market 20% sell off. Powell is an amazing ass
288 2018-12-20 04:30:30 Zim retailers just wake up in the morning and start changing the Prices on their commodities. That behavior #MustBeLeftIn2018
289 2018-12-20 04:28:32 Supply & demand doesn't matter right now in gold as long as it is a digital price controlled by the HFT goons. That will break at some point but lots of criminal activity going on in at the CRIMEX. Repeal of Uptick Rule & Glass-Steagall opened the door. Commodities rigged by HFT.
290 2018-12-20 04:17:48 I'm just glad we're getting that conversation going again!! That is where xrp will be living, the commodities world.   Thank you it does feel great!!!!   :)
291 2018-12-20 04:11:37 It was PMLN and Mr.Dar who successfully exited IMF program. Tabdeeli will further increase end users products and commodities' price under the cover/ on the pretext of IMF.
292 2018-12-20 04:05:00 They are lending in USD (hedges their USD short) and then gain control of physical commodities/assets that they then re-price in CNY over time.  This is a winning strategy unless the US says “USD’s aren’t good in Eurasia” (aka ends USD reserve status.).
293 2018-12-20 04:03:48 The current predicament in insane surge price of basic commodities really requires us to make lifestyle changes and modify our spending habits.  Mga ganito na talaga pinoproblema ko noh. Haha Very tito.  
294 2018-12-20 04:03:26 Investors should ask themselves. Where is the money flowing/fleeing to? Answers: gold, cash & debt. Where will they flow next.... back into stocks and commodities once fear abates. When? Fed tone changes more dovish, when Trump is impeached/replaced and when wars fizzle.
295 2018-12-20 04:01:10 Theyre all just commodities to barking.
296 2018-12-20 03:58:34 I’ve never seen prices go down, except commodities and technology 
297 2018-12-20 03:40:53 Sure....nothing to see...just ignore worst global liquidity since ‘08, IG/HY spreads blowing out, collapsing inflation expectations and plummeting commodities, European demand , and China mess..But sure,
It’s “just about stocks going up”...
298 2018-12-20 03:40:43 Hwende We want development, availability of affordable commodities, cheap data, a lot of things to improve our everyday lives & that’s what you must be pushing. You like wasting time on things not beneficial to povo. You don’t recognize the executive so what’s your problem?
299 2018-12-20 03:38:19 It will also make Main Street more competitive and more in control to allow Free Markets to kick in and allow true price discovery on commodities, Hence cutting the Globalists out of price fixing and reduce their influence.
300 2018-12-20 03:37:24 Indeed!

Love the show btw :-)
301 2018-12-20 03:37:07 El próximo gobierno no va a tener un boom de commodities...
302 2018-12-20 03:29:52 Gap is filled and by morning someone will be saying China bought overnight lol, that is if the gap holds and we are higher in the morning. If you see that please tweet it out so I can see it. The other good one will be equities are pouring into commodities.
303 2018-12-20 03:26:47 From the day @MthuliNcube started wearing the scuff, all his reasoning has become questionable. I heard him saying the budget is pro poor yet ever since his appointment our situation has worsened, drugs transport and basic commodities are expensive beyond the reach of poor
304 2018-12-20 03:25:48 (C) to clarify the virtual currencies that  qualify as commodities for both existing currencies and ones that may be created in the future;    ripple needs to win pending lawsuit . so xrp  is still looked at as a commodity
305 2018-12-20 03:25:38 Sadly a 401(k) allocation doesn’t give you many options. Seriously, commodities! Oil right now. WTI is pegging mid $40 to $50 a full year out. I’m shorting Rubles.
306 2018-12-20 03:25:21 The rate of duty varies depending on the tariff classification of the commodity. Some commodities have 2%, 3%, 5% , 15%, 20%, 30% ,50% rate of duty.
307 2018-12-20 03:23:31 It's flabbergasting to watch the ivory tower Fed idiots ignoring basic economic data, from stock market drop, massive increase in VIX, collapse in commodities, all data that would have pointed to caution to any reasonable observer, instead continue to raise rates...  #FirePowell
308 2018-12-20 03:12:43 Yeah well we don’t have the time or luxury to hope some 5th round RB is ready to go. We need playmakers right now that are proven commodities on both sides of the ball. It’s time to be super aggressive before Rodgers is really done. And with the right new coach it’s all-in time
309 2018-12-20 03:10:04 right to the top
don't look back
turning to rags and giving the commodities a rain-check
310 2018-12-20 03:07:42 Should you do it when global economic growth is starting to role over? As Druck points out, all of the cyclicals are hurting, autos, housing, oil, commodities. Is this consistent with a strong economy? 
311 2018-12-20 02:47:48 @tzeroblockchain @OverstockCEO 200 mil worth of cobalt deposits on the blockchain... only the beginning. These commodities are generally illiquid. Literally creating markets here. It’s big.
312 2018-12-20 02:45:03 It's sad how close friends just vanish once they find someone better. We live in a throwaway society where even the people become discarded commodities. What a terrible place we've made.
313 2018-12-20 02:44:04 Right?! If he’s just gonna speak of known commodities. JP, CoC and AIC were excellent. I haven’t heard the Church yet.
314 2018-12-20 02:39:48 Personally, I’m more concerned that you’re still holding commodities 
315 2018-12-20 02:34:25 Well I also believe in diversification. I believe there is still room for gold and real estate will always have value. Commodities, etc. But for the future #Bitcoin or something like it is the only thing that makes sense. For the so, moe, uoa, etc.
316 2018-12-20 02:29:30 También puedes incluir monedas y commodities
317 2018-12-20 02:26:07 Added to the buy low and hold is that there are moments where market cycles do not favor ANY diverse mix of growth stocks which we saw in 2008. In prep for these times we assess if the risks are favorable more to growth or defensive bonds or commodities or cash, then allocate
318 2018-12-20 02:23:48 Honey, don't believe everything you hear. Women are not commodities,  like older model cars. We are living, breathing animal energies with extraordinary powers of attraction and vitality.  And don't you forget it.
319 2018-12-20 02:23:02 Cut drugs out of your life and you will no longer feel neurological attached to capitalist commodities.
320 2018-12-20 02:21:52 Well done, hope this continues for 5 years and wish you to achieve more. Also keep price scale same or lower for other commodities. Waiving off should not increase cost of other daily needs as well. All the best. Well done again.

331 2018-12-20 02:04:12 Oil prices pared gains following the FOMC rate hikes decision(s) as the U.S. dollar index trimmed losses. A stronger dollar makes greenback-denominated commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies.

Tem que ficar de olho com o aumento da aversão ao risco. No curto prazo, pode impactar o prêmio de risco na curva de juros.o que afeta varejistas e construtoras.
339 2018-12-20 01:15:53 Oil down, commodities down, import price from USA down... Inflation will be lower. It will be easier to Fed say, data depended, we will wait
340 2018-12-20 01:13:04 If you raise interest rates the price of housing must come down. The cost of commodities also will have to come down. It could be a good thing, since inflation only helps those who have. 
But the negative is;If you bought a house when the rates were low, you probably paid a lot.

342 2018-12-20 00:57:07 US $ rose & industrial commodities, shares lifted as markets responded to the Fed’s rosier economic outlook & its lowered assessment of the “neutral rate” (2.8%, down from 3%). @MicMcCarthy_CMC

345 2018-12-20 00:33:20 EM y commodities salvo oil operan bien en términos relativos. Ello le da sustento a la teoría de que la economía de usa desacelera pero sin entrar a recesión. Rango probable 2,3/7 de crecimiento. Con este número las E pueden crecer 6/7% y llegar a 170. A 2500 p/e de 14,7. LONG.
346 2018-12-20 00:30:27 Not from your perspective, maybe. What about the state itself? What if the Orwell realized an administrative bureaucracy could grow so out of control, it would become sentient and begin seeing people as commodities instead of individuals with dignity? 
347 2018-12-20 00:30:07 This whole @CBS Michael Weatherly bs & how Eliza Dushku was treated is an EXACT example of what I've been saying for a while: the entertainment industry treats "male leads" like they're rare commodities & women like, "there's always another beautiful woman, so... ". 
348 2018-12-20 00:25:08 me: oh my internet is acting wonky, lets play some p5d!
me: -plays  tanakas amazin commodities cause i wonder if i could finish it-
me, half way through the song: I regret this
349 2018-12-20 00:17:57 It has continued for 3 reasons:

1. As long as all commodities remain priced in USD.

2. As long as no nation wants to & has the army to price commodities in non-USD.

3.  As long as US interest expense was not >100% of tax receipts. 

#'s 1 & 2 are no longer true, #3 about to be
350 2018-12-20 00:16:56 Due to the sky falling down across the commodities space... I’ve picked up a few more #ARV at 10c... very good value at this level, assuming the DOW bases shortly! #gold #copper #cobalt
351 2018-12-20 00:16:33 esta noche yo miraría el yuan , que hace , se acerca a los 7 despidanse de los commodities
352 2018-12-20 00:16:05 If equities were to continue to fall and commodities were to rise in next 6 months. Would you still be bearish gold?
353 2018-12-20 00:15:20 @HenrikZeberg You definitely have a contrarian view on Gold as sentiment in Gold is still quite high. My view though is commodities have been in bear market since 2007. Gold not as long but at least from 2013. Surely commodities aren't far from find a bottom.
354 2018-12-20 00:12:57 This is exciting!
(C) to clarify the virtual currencies that qualify as commodities for both existing currencies and ones that may be created in the future;
355 2018-12-20 00:09:04 Yes goes to yard and commodities operators and broker, traders.
