4 2019-01-17 23:54:53 During the 10 years of the Fusion Super Bull Market, what have been usual worry questions? .. isn’t this a dead cat bounce? Isn’t it better to buy once good news appear? What will the Fed do? Why not buy only the leading SP 500 stocks?

I already tried tonight, but the lady who stocks the shelves apparently wasn't running ahead.

“Personal property.”

10 2019-01-17 23:50:50 The teachers didn't choose to play stocks. The hedge funders didn't choose a low income career. The hedge funders also didn't choose the teachers' wages. The government did.

In investing, i seem to do well with bottomed stocks than the trending ones..
