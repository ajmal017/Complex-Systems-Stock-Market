6 2018-08-30 23:59:24 @jiffylube just got an oil change and tire rotation. Not happy, I go out to leave and notice no rotation was even done. Sales person says it was complete. I then inform him that I have one tire different and it was in the rear and hadn’t moved. Recommend other places !!!

42 2018-08-30 23:57:38 @jec79 "cleanest, most ethical"… swing-for-the-fences is a good way to put it. But I think it goes deeper—right to the con job at the heart of "ethical oil", the reasonable point gone awry. Bear w/ me: If Scheer/Levant/etc. said Saudi Arabia was an awful, brutal dictatorship…
43 2018-08-30 23:57:32 them fish oil vitamins do justice
44 2018-08-30 23:57:26 how bc and Alberta will last  without  oil   
not very long , 
      those province will go down too
45 2018-08-30 23:57:22 this BJP govt is making India unliveable... oil prices are skyrocketing everyday... this pro capitalist, pro ambani adani govt is a threat to the livelihood of common men like me
46 2018-08-30 23:57:17 Our oil is the cleanest, most ethical and environmentally friendly in the world. There is not another country on earth that has nearly the same regulations that we have, and we can’t even get it to global markets.
47 2018-08-30 23:57:12 The world’s “dirtiest” oil is in Nigeria but only Alberta oil is targeted by activists to land lock  Alberta oil as funded by American interest groups via the Tar Sanda Campaign.
48 2018-08-30 23:57:02 she's lovely, but has straight hair and NO IDEA. "Twist in some coconut oil and pin it up and sit upright for at least four hours in cool air while praying for minimum humidity" may sound simple, but...
49 2018-08-30 23:56:58 I was betting on olive oil, damn it
50 2018-08-30 23:56:56 @estella_aiko ......so move to another state.....go to north dakota..they got alot of rich fellows there...who work in the oil industry.
51 2018-08-30 23:56:42 Women get a car and don’t check the oil, tire pressure, coolant, nothing. They just wake up & drive that mf 
52 2018-08-30 23:56:35 Buy hazelnut oil from their gift shop. You can thank me later. I love cooking with it! Also eat at the top of the needle, 100% worth
53 2018-08-30 23:56:33 Both from the mud so we know know that soil be. Don't slip but we know how slick that, that oil be

57 2018-08-30 23:56:18 He is a successful promoter. We don’t know anything about his business.. do you know anyone who has filed for bankruptcy 11 times?   I think he’s a snake oil salesman. I don’t believe he’s Christian, I do not believe he has conservative values. he’s a pathological liar
58 2018-08-30 23:56:15 So you would think that you would be in favour of pipelines then, or are you just one of those people that think we don't need oil.

61 2018-08-30 23:56:02 The plane ran out of gasoline again and this time Skip Rutherford Trump pumped oil into the fuselage to make sure it would end with a bang and yet this is probably not true and yet at the joint Andrews base in Maryland was the start of a new beginning for Cindy as the next U.S.
62 2018-08-30 23:55:54 ぽはや
63 2018-08-30 23:55:20 He prefers his oil already refined and ready for use at the gas station.   Probably the same stance as food comes from the grocery store. All the pesky stuff of how it is produced, transported and environmentally regulated is not of his concern.
64 2018-08-30 23:55:12 I made chocolate chip cookies with olive oil instead of vegetable oil and they came out flat like pancakes  still good tho
65 2018-08-30 23:55:08 We used this recipe for the sauce. Just the oil/butter, garlic, lime juice, honey, cayenne, salt. Roasted the minced garlic in oil & butter then added the rest. Tossed the roasted shrimp in it. Yum!
66 2018-08-30 23:55:07 Yeah you would. If you want to talk about “dirty” oil then look no father than outside of LA at the Placerita Oil Field which generates TWICE the level of emissions than Alberta’s bitumen sands.
67 2018-08-30 23:54:44 You do realize we have the cleanest, most efficient and most regulated oil in the world. Yet we can’t even get it to global markets, and we are importing Saudi oil that doesn’t have nearly the regulations we have. Not to mention the human rights violations going on there.
68 2018-08-30 23:54:41 Anything moisturizing is great! I used hemp lotion and coconut oil!
69 2018-08-30 23:54:39 子乗せ自転車が盛大に横転して、子供がギャン泣きしてるのを遠目に見かけて、心臓がバクバクして泣きそうになったマン。ヘルメットしてて良かった。長野市、意外にもヘルメットしてない子乗せ自転車多い。
70 2018-08-30 23:54:39 A car place to get oil and parts for your car!
71 2018-08-30 23:54:28 It’s time we change the equalization structure and eliminate oil and gas revenues from equalization, why should alberta pay out to Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Quebec when they all have hydraulic fracturing bans.  It’s time the west stop the heavy lifting
72 2018-08-30 23:54:01 Right. The Church also recognizes some marriages that happen outside of the Church as valid. 
Confirmation and Last Rites call for chrism oil, but if none is available another oil can be consecrated and used.
If substance > form for four sacraments...
73 2018-08-30 23:54:00 Yes, can Cdns be educated on what this future could look like, the benefits & impact for the majority of Cdns instead of a small few corp's earning billions at the expense of our air, water, land, jobs & health.  Cdns will have to make a choice, to see non oil options
74 2018-08-30 23:53:45 So if you want to find out if life existed on Mars, why not send a vehicle to look for oil deposits like here on earth. If there were seas teeming with life, there should be oil deposits. If there is oil, burn it to create a heavier Co2 atmosphere to grow stuff & trap heat.
75 2018-08-30 23:53:43 Thieves oil!
76 2018-08-30 23:53:39 Well Mr Scheer you just made one of the silliest statements  about oil.  Even those in the industry would not say it was the cleanest, environmentally friendly, etc. Just look at companies like Shell who talk about alternative clean energy solutions.
77 2018-08-30 23:53:39 Keep digging. Let HHSM know if you strike oil.
78 2018-08-30 23:53:30 And we can afford 4 billion in corporate welfare for oil companies?

82 2018-08-30 23:52:56 Oil it's not expensive

85 2018-08-30 23:52:29 Some bike lubricant oil I hear works
86 2018-08-30 23:52:23 What about trying to con people out of money for snake oil products is epic?
87 2018-08-30 23:52:22 Really I have never heard anything about this but I watch no mainstream media. 
Diane Lane did a good job in un faithfull. I will research it.
88 2018-08-30 23:52:18 Told my sister I had a headache and she came in looking for my peppermint oil to rub on my temples....  I guess I really am THAT family member lol but I put her on to that good good  #essentialoils
89 2018-08-30 23:52:05 Nah fr her bones need some oil she’s bare stiff
90 2018-08-30 23:51:59 Triggers 2:
- Drums/bass that I feel more than hear (hello panic attacks)
- People insisting on the laying on of hands or putting oil on my forehead
- When everyone is supposed to pray out loud all together (it also gets called Korean prayer, which is...unnecessary)
91 2018-08-30 23:51:57 Took her car to @Tirekingdom, car broke down, independent mechanic said no oil in car, now @Tirekingdom tells us it's not their fault?  #stayawayfromcrooks #wontadmiterror
92 2018-08-30 23:51:52 Religion and politics go together like oil and water. I don’t trust anyone whose politics are manipulated by a popular fantasy, whatever that fantasy is.  It allows them to believe in other fantasies without evidentiary basis. Like trickle down economics.
93 2018-08-30 23:51:39 Good luck to both @CarlosMunoz034 and the team!
94 2018-08-30 23:51:35 Well of course, they are going to have to do something way worse than bombing children to get off that gravey train.   Run out of oil is they only thing that comes to mind.
95 2018-08-30 23:51:35 Jaysus. Do they owe him money for heating oil or something??
96 2018-08-30 23:51:34 Man i love that old charlatan Al Gore. Took that snake oil called climate change and made millions. Bravo
97 2018-08-30 23:51:32 Try it for sure...no frying, oil, etc. use whatever mayo you want...
98 2018-08-30 23:51:24 It’s simple really.
More  fracking = more cheap oil = more reason to drive = less reason to bike or walk = less exercise + more opportunities to eat nasty drive through food in your car.

99 2018-08-30 23:50:47 I use normal model shop lubricant oil

102 2018-08-30 23:50:39 One option is to invest in solar and wind energy - the approval process is a heck of a lot easier and then you become self reliant rather than forever chained to fickle oil prices and face facts pipelines will never be easy to ram through, nor should they be.
103 2018-08-30 23:50:31 Do NOT use @Tirekingdom EVER!  Never had an issue with my daughter's car, then they messed up an oil change and blame us.  #theirfaultourissue #admityoumessedup
104 2018-08-30 23:50:18 #TransMountain #KinderMorgan #cdnpoli They think they're winning. After all, they aren't going to stop using oil. They aren't even sad that this means more inbound tankers. They think foreign oil is fine. They just hate Canadian oil.
105 2018-08-30 23:50:15 Sometimes I think about what will happen in the ME when the Arabs run out of oil.
106 2018-08-30 23:49:55 much and then Michelle Obama got her oil painting easels out and drew a beautiful picture of Barack kneeling over the body (of course he was draped people...people) and he did the fantango over the gasket which was parked near the Jersey state border and then Michelle spread out
107 2018-08-30 23:49:53 Yep!
Best fat for baking in order is lard, butter, crisco(hydrogenated veg oil)
for frying, I prefer Lard, beef tallow, clrified butter, crisco.
108 2018-08-30 23:49:44 Would it be possible to obtain the studies showing that Canadian oil is the most eco-friendly source of energy?
109 2018-08-30 23:49:42 I ALMOST SAW MY LIFE FLASH BEFORE MT EYES. I WAS USING THE FRIER TO MAKE CHICKEN AND THERE WAS A SPLASH THAT ALMOST HIT MY FACE. I MANAGED TO DODGE BUT I GOT SOME HOT OIL ON MY FOREHEAD
110 2018-08-30 23:49:33 Orange essential oil gets sticker residue off everything!
111 2018-08-30 23:49:30 Got to make so much oil tonight 
112 2018-08-30 23:49:27 As a Canadian, I'm now very disappointed. Instead of reassuring Canadians, and anyone who cares about the environment, you decide to side with the oil business and $$$. Be on the right side of history. There's still time.
113 2018-08-30 23:49:22 石油だってオリーブオイルだって変わらぬオイルだ。だからみんな、資源は大切に使おう。
114 2018-08-30 23:49:18 Industrial metals slumped, although oil prices continued to firm. A stronger US dollar may help in the Asia Pacific region today, ahead of important data from China @MicMcCarthy_CMC
115 2018-08-30 23:49:06 oil and mhog sitting at a table together as if he knows who she is
116 2018-08-30 23:48:58 Honestly it’s so insane that people are genuinely so conditioned into thinking that skinny is the only attractive size/shape to be. ALSO half of the idiots hurling abuse ain’t oil paintings themselves! I’ve had it it w these bigots!!
117 2018-08-30 23:48:41 People are always complimenting our sand oil.
118 2018-08-30 23:48:37 This was discussed well before recession. It is about maximizing money for oil while you can. It should have happened many years ago, but too many get stuck on personal/bipartisan agendas and country has never shown ability to work together. Disappointing.
119 2018-08-30 23:48:36 You've just demonstrated you haven't a clue what you're talking about. Oil is not, and never has been, an environmentally-friendly energy. What planet are you living on that you're so blind?
120 2018-08-30 23:48:30 use lavender oil it does wonders
121 2018-08-30 23:48:27 Coconut oil and leave in conditioners
122 2018-08-30 23:48:13 Mr. Sheer. Do you honestly believe what you tweeted. I know we currently need oil to keep everything running, but clean and ethical??
123 2018-08-30 23:48:11 นาบๆๆๆๆเอ้ย...นวดๆๆๆๆ
124 2018-08-30 23:47:56 Yet UKs racist snake oil salesman Nigel Farage is on his way to you to mobilize & wind up the RW, feed you BS about him being anti establishment. plant a seed of doubt about the neighbor youve known for 20 years then scuttle back to the hole he came from

Like I said snake oil
125 2018-08-30 23:47:47 HOT OIL JUST FLEW IN MY FUCKING EYE
126 2018-08-30 23:47:45 Trump's Arse! Your Economy is like an Oil tanker! It'll take some time for Him to turn Obama's Economy around and steer it into the Rocks!
127 2018-08-30 23:47:44 I didn’t know that I will do some research on this.
128 2018-08-30 23:47:43 Coconut oil dried a little patch of my baby hair 
129 2018-08-30 23:47:32 Conservatives would destroy our land, air, water & health all for quick $$$ from oil w/ltd job opps.  There r many nations w/ no oil who's economies r healthy.  Our politicians have no skill building a strong economy.  They all need to go, we can do better. STOP THE $4.5B deal
130 2018-08-30 23:47:29 I will check my choice! As I'm going for 3rd Party Options since both Mainstream Political Parties are now in cahoots with 1 another! Damn NeoLiberals and NeoCons got us in the Iraq War, further destabilized that region with also now the Yemen War due to Saudis oil interests!

132 2018-08-30 23:46:52 Oil supplies are vanishing.. From the Atlantic basin, from the northwest of Europe, the Mediterranean & even West Africa.

#backwardation is setting in.. where the price of a prompt dated contract rises above a long dated one.
133 2018-08-30 23:46:51 Mental Illness is real, I deal with a cousin everyday who I feed house and all around take care of because it’s the right thing to do. Also she cannot seem to take care of herself. It’s a burden but blood is blood and love is love.

134 2018-08-30 23:46:50 If you don’t cook with coconut oil, what is you doing???
135 2018-08-30 23:46:49 I hate when I come for an oil change and they tell me I need to do more shit to my car, like ughhhh no. My dad will take care of it 
136 2018-08-30 23:46:45 Restart energy east! It’s a better option anyway keep the oil in Canada  why do we always sell our natural resources to someone else then buy back what they produce from it?
137 2018-08-30 23:46:43 We found CBD massage oil that I use for my neck and back and it does wonders!
138 2018-08-30 23:46:42 First of all five guys uses peanut oil so suck it and way better than in n out
139 2018-08-30 23:46:29 #WhitfieldSitcom tonight: sweet wife was frying pork chops and one rebelled and kamikaze’d back into the grease and belly-flopped a ton of hot oil onto her foot, causing a gnarly burn. Had high hopes of attending the #BattleoftheBridge tonight...thanks a lot, pork chop...
140 2018-08-30 23:46:15 Chuck the snake oil salesman.
141 2018-08-30 23:46:08 The Dorn feeling all scentsy. Appreciate him sharing what Hugo Boss scent is about
I love earthy wood scents I love leather scented candles /oil. Some men prefer scent of pumpkin in a womans cologne. Maybe smells like pie?

145 2018-08-30 23:45:47 I go to hsv for a oil change and pay almost $60 every time.... I get one from TN and pay $45. Wow.
146 2018-08-30 23:45:45 甘えるな！
147 2018-08-30 23:45:37 I use neetfoots oil n’ let it sit for a little. I also use a cloth dremel tool with bees wax applied I run it over the wood, to seal it in. 
after that I buff with a dry cloth dremel bit, apply oil as needed to maintain it. My grandfather taught me about knives when I was younger
148 2018-08-30 23:45:32 Did you know the fashion industry is the second largest polluter in the world after the oil industry?
149 2018-08-30 23:45:31 Coconut oil, dish soap and vinegar
150 2018-08-30 23:45:28 I certainly dont care. Any policy that kill the oil sands faster, discouraging investment is great. The BC forests are on fire and AB is getting the smoke because the world is bringing too much fossil fuel.
151 2018-08-30 23:45:18 Recently learned that some peanut butter (most?) requires you to stir in the oil first? Growing up poor did not prepare me for what tf I just saw in that jar

154 2018-08-30 23:45:06 I’m just hoping for an oil rich football fanatic to drop 6billi on the club, all because of a dare.
155 2018-08-30 23:45:04 They’re fried in a better oil. I mean if you can’t get with it because it’s not dipped in a fat oil you’re missing out. Getting them crispy with some salt is amazing. I guess I’m just more into things that don’t require to be dipped in lard at times
156 2018-08-30 23:44:58 恐ろしくお金がないぞ

158 2018-08-30 23:44:35 Gee, maybe we shouldn't be so dependent on oil 

…then again, what do I know? 
159 2018-08-30 23:44:18 Harper and the Oil Lobby stacked the NEB. The NEB dropped a bogus report. The Liberals bought it and Rachel became the cheerleader. It backfired. Resignations will be accepted.
160 2018-08-30 23:44:06 ぽきた
161 2018-08-30 23:44:04 Olive oil & sea salt maybe??
162 2018-08-30 23:43:55 Coconut oil and cucumber peel
163 2018-08-30 23:43:50 Yes, lets keep selling our Oil to the US for half price only. They are such trust worthy trade partners right now...geez...WE HAVE TO GET OUR OIL TO WORLD MARKETS!!!
164 2018-08-30 23:43:40 Not an expert but it’s more complicated than that. Many times it’s more profitable for us to sell our oil and buy oil elsewhere. The pipeline was to sell our oil elsewhere, not domestic. Although I agree that this is too much. It’s a government mandate. It should be built.
165 2018-08-30 23:43:20 I left work early today but got a text from my boss. Her husband took his truck in for an oil change... and bought a new truck. 

I asked her if she needed an alibi. She laughed. 
I may just tell the police she was having dinner at my place anyway.
166 2018-08-30 23:43:17 True Story: Sat next to gentleman “Oklahoma Oil Worker in Managemt” on 4 hr plane ride.  We had great conversation about family spouses oils industry OPEC  Stock Oil reserves in Prudhoe Bay. Plane lands conversation ends with “you’re very intelligent and articulate.” 
167 2018-08-30 23:43:12 Investments in transit and clean energy (which I’m in favour of) can only get made when there are profits to tax. By shipping our oil to market elsewhere and not over paying for it from other countries we keep $$s here and raise our tax base rather than sending $$s overseas
168 2018-08-30 23:43:06 Dear @RachelNotley, Start massively expanding the green economy & guaranteeing retraining and jobs for life in eco-energy to anyone in the AB oil industry. It’s downright embarrassing that an NDP gov’t isn’t already on top of this.  #KeepItInTheGround
169 2018-08-30 23:42:55 raw sewage from Vancouver and Victoria okay, oil by rail okay, fuel pipeline from US okay, but a pipeline for Cdn oil...the whales. #LMFAO
170 2018-08-30 23:42:52 My dad paid for my oil change and for my tire to get fixed today and my class ended early so today is a good day and I need some food
171 2018-08-30 23:42:41 It's certainly good news for the oil companies.

175 2018-08-30 23:41:14 I've been dealing with a migraine for two days now and have tried SO many things to get rid of it, but as soon as I apply some lavender oil to my temples, I feel so much relief? What is this sorcery!?
176 2018-08-30 23:41:03 Do you understand how the economy works, Dean? Do you think Trump makes a decree on Monday and the economy is all better on Friday? FFS. It's like turning an oil tanker, and it's nothing to do with the orange babyman.
177 2018-08-30 23:40:56 How about obeying the court’s decision. Then start massively expanding the green economy & guaranteeing retraining and jobs for life in eco-energy to anyone in the oil industry. It’s downright embarrassing that an NDP gov’t isn’t already on top of this.

183 2018-08-30 23:40:23 Nah. It's more about central Asian oil, minerals, lithium, gemstones  worth trillions of dollars and of course geopolitics. They just want a route & a regime change in Iran will just do that.

185 2018-08-30 23:40:11 Wells are drying elsewhere except Africa. Brexit in shambles, TPP dead, NAFTA on the deathbed. Oil no longer significant as more and more countries pursue green energy. Africa’s population exploding as it dwindles in other countries. High population=high demand=large market.

188 2018-08-30 23:40:04 No thanks. I’m busy being a productive member of society and doing my best to responsibly & ethically drill oil wells so that trolls like you can use the products made from it which are delivered to places you can conveniently get to thanks to diesel powered logistics #Peace
189 2018-08-30 23:39:57 the oil doesn't "belong" to anyone except those the land belongs to -- the Cree, Assiniboine and Anishinaabe of Treaty 6, so too bad. also treason against a settler-colonial state is a good thing actually
190 2018-08-30 23:39:57 They are! I stopped using them many years ago. I went there one time they told me my oil was a certain color and should look different. The next time I went in they said the EXACT same thing. And they treat women customers bad. Tires Plus and Walmart are cool. Avoid Jiffy Lube.
191 2018-08-30 23:39:55 It’s dried up cause of Canadian policies.  Oil demand is going higher and it used to be Canada was politically safe country, but makes more sense to drill now in Venezuela.

199 2018-08-30 23:38:15 You're based in Calgary--oil just got hammered today via a really bad court decision and  US special interest groups but you still run this AP crap about global warming. Do you ever wonder why you're circling the drain as a paper?

206 2018-08-30 23:37:54 @JustinTrudeau invest in our trains. We are going to need the larger capacity infrastructure moving forward. Take the oil on the rails, unfortunately. Oil will be needed for many everyday items other than fuel, eventually.
207 2018-08-30 23:37:54 Ha! @tedcruz or @JohnCornyn stand up for their constituents? The only "constituents" they have are oil barons, the NRA and Russian oligarchs. They have zero interest in representing real Texans.

211 2018-08-30 23:37:13 The worst is auto repair. I visited my mother in Las Vegas a few years ago and she had just had her oil changed.  The business told her she needed new shocks and they wouldn't release the vehicle unless she replaced them for "safety" reasons. I got her car but what a pain.
212 2018-08-30 23:37:05 I’ve been putting cbd oil in my morning cholorphyl lemon water and I swear on my LIFE this combo puts you in the best mood all day. WE LUV PLANTS
213 2018-08-30 23:36:54 If anyone wants to bring me a full chef’s jacket that’d be rad. The rate at which I burn my arms w oil splatter while cooking is at an all time high.
214 2018-08-30 23:36:17 Really?...with that in mind Canada should by a broken oil pipeline for $4.5 billion.

C’mon @JustinTrudeau, we’re supposed to be better than this.

216 2018-08-30 23:36:05 sounds great - why don't you guys do that. it will have a two-fold effect: one, force the purchasers of your fuel to figure out alternate sources of energy, and two, ween your province off of the toxic lifeblood that is oil money. maybe then we can move forward, yeah?
217 2018-08-30 23:36:00 @JohnIbbitson Oil and gas is only 5% of the gdp of Canada, stop with the "what are we gonna make here"
218 2018-08-30 23:35:59 I wonder if he styles with Palm oil 
219 2018-08-30 23:35:48 Get a bunch of train cars. We still got oil to get to tidewater but now it’s gotta go in 40 foot sections on top of the earth & water & through the towns.
220 2018-08-30 23:35:36 You could invest billions into innovative green energy projects making Canada a world leader and provide jobs for decades. Instead you prop up dirty oil companies as our country burns in climate change fires. Give up the pipeline and be a real leader.

236 2018-08-30 23:33:44 You know how major car factories, steel plants, Kodak, etc, etc, shut down and it sucked hard but somehow humanity survived? The same will happen with the oil sands. I’m sorry for the (potential) job losses but life will go on.
237 2018-08-30 23:33:34 You all laughed and bragged about your heritage fund and huge salaries your oil patch workers were earning.   You pissed it away and now are whining even though Alberta’s economy is apparently doing just fine.  Cry me a river.
238 2018-08-30 23:33:26 In her mind: "Remember the oil, remember the oil...."
239 2018-08-30 23:33:25 Before they switched to canola oil it was Chick-fil-a. Post-peanut oil Chick-fil-a fries it would prob be perfectly cooked McDonald’s fries followed not too far behind by Shake Shack. I love me some crinkle cut fries. 

Five Guys is trash. Like worse than Arby’s curly fries trash
240 2018-08-30 23:33:25 Not long after that, Gabriel moaned again, and the room was filled with the sweet smell of candy as his oil glands oozed oil.
241 2018-08-30 23:33:20 Nothing is ethical or environmentally-friendly about the oil in California which is dirtier than the oil sands. Why are you not complaining about that?
242 2018-08-30 23:33:11 sad day for the majority of canadians, happy day for a few. Where will all the money come from now for the monthly welfare cheques? No pipeline, no way to get our oil to the foreign markets, less revenue for Canada, more people out of work, congratulations horgan and a few more
243 2018-08-30 23:33:06 Nevermind I needed an egg for a cake I’m baking but I just added extra oil lol
244 2018-08-30 23:32:59 It may be the cleanest oil however the process it was approved under is still not environmentally safe enough to win in court.Govt smart to purchase it so that they can find tune the environmental & consultation process to get it passed. KM would not have.
245 2018-08-30 23:32:56 Most, like Bush, own stocks in oil
246 2018-08-30 23:32:54 I was in the Philippines at Clark AFB when Mt. Pinatubo erupted and we had a 2 week evac on oil tankers, then was airlifted by chopper to Guam. They i came to the USA. We went through Cebu.. i sswam with dolphins and got to shoot a battleship cannon
 It was epic!
247 2018-08-30 23:32:45 I should, why don’t you let me know how yours went and then I will make a decision.
248 2018-08-30 23:32:37 Drop of tea tree oil in warm water should help keep it clean...Nice little paw soak

250 2018-08-30 23:32:29 Thinking I’m going to be balling in mex...then my car wanted to fuck around and need an oil change right before I drive it to TJ this weekend 
251 2018-08-30 23:32:24 Try drizzling them in olive oil and baking them. Taste just as good and healthier.
252 2018-08-30 23:32:11 I love my province and my country. But Alberta is hurting, and hurting badly. Getting our oil to foreign markets isn’t just a business issue - it affects every single one of us in Alberta. We need Canada to be here for us now, or the Canadian Federation will have failed.

254 2018-08-30 23:31:55 The only right way forward is to wind down fossil fuel use as fast as possible. If it was really about jobs you would be doing all you could to create opportunities in renewables for oil sector workers.
255 2018-08-30 23:31:53 Just keep giving your opinion. 
That’s why I follow you.

279 2018-08-30 23:28:58 To anyone in boulder county Colorado or anyone who wants to hear from a 3rd party candidate who has good ideas and is not bought and paid for by big oil and gas unlike the other 2 parties listen to kgnu in 30 min all 3 will be there #RealWave
280 2018-08-30 23:28:34 Any guesses as to why oil didn’t have a bigger reaction to Iran threatening to block oil shipments?
281 2018-08-30 23:28:31 It’s not leaky and has an excellent safety record from the past 65 years it has been in use! Much safer and ecologically sound than transporting oil by railcar which will continue in a much larger amounts now!
282 2018-08-30 23:28:27 Canada needs a green energy crown corporation to invest in the future of all Canadians. Its mandate must include reconciliation for the damage done to native peoples in the name of oil and other energy projects.
283 2018-08-30 23:28:26 My wife's car would still work if motor oil was labeled "essential."

286 2018-08-30 23:28:03 Actually I think Scheers tweet was idiotic too. I'm pro oil, conservative and reasonable.  The correct answer is nuclear energy
287 2018-08-30 23:27:47 Do we have a approval for an ethical oil pipeline, yet?

290 2018-08-30 23:27:11 Yeah. Big mistake there. Would’ve been fine had he said most ethical, etc OIL.
291 2018-08-30 23:27:07 All of those tourists covered with oil.
292 2018-08-30 23:27:02 Northwestern: They’re quietly building a winner I think they’re a team that can make trips to Lucas Oil for years to come. Pat has done a great job with this team.
293 2018-08-30 23:26:53 Wild growth oil & coconut oil is  for hair growth. You’re welcome.
294 2018-08-30 23:26:26 Or maybe it’s because the dems like yourself have tax them to death. Way to many people in Ct. are living paycheck to paycheck due to the high cost of living, gas, oil & Hussein Obama’s Obamacare which is anything but affordable. Mr. Murphy the spin dr. at it again. Doom & gloom.
295 2018-08-30 23:26:19 Uh a serious situation like the world being on fire in part due to knobs who still insist on pumping out the dirtiest oil on earth? 
296 2018-08-30 23:25:58 A whole bunch of juices and stuff but the main ingredient is castor oil!
297 2018-08-30 23:25:55 He's going to promote whale oil & whalebone corsets next isn't he?
298 2018-08-30 23:25:55 Things are looking up. A snake oil salesman told me I’m gonna make a million dollars.
299 2018-08-30 23:25:29 I don't understand why Notley didn't show our social license to the court? 
Notley has hammered the oil industry w/regulations, brought radicals onto advisory board & saddled Albertans with a carbon tax to expedite this 
It did NOTHING!
This is on Rachel Notley!

But like, I always want to take a nap sooo..

303 2018-08-30 23:24:59 I was born in Alberta. It should be sun country, not oil country. The sooner everyone embraces the change the better for the future prosperity of the province.
304 2018-08-30 23:24:37 Venezuela has 6 times more proved oil reserves than US (Per BP World Energy Report 2018). It's a shame that the country cannot capitalize on their natural assets to ease the current horrible hunger crisis.
305 2018-08-30 23:23:53 It’s not the Stig, it’s his Colombian cousin.
306 2018-08-30 23:23:49 Me too. I doing mine Asian style this time. Red Pepper, Black Pepper, Hot Mustard, Ginger Garlic for Rub..... Mixing a Sauce with Soy, Peanut sauce, Olive oil and Rice wine vinegar, for basting. Of course Sarachi on the side.

310 2018-08-30 23:23:10 I have realised already that its all about power, money , resources. They wanted power they split the Muslims into Saudia and Iran. Tjey wanted Oil, they went into Afghanistan and Iraq. Now they want money, so its an open trade war and sanctions.
311 2018-08-30 23:22:40 YES NAILED IT!!!! 

The entirety of western North America is literally burning because OF OIL AND PIPLINES AND THE DISGUSTING TAR SANDS, THANK JESUS IT IS, SO THE DENIERS WILL FONALLY LEARN SOMETHING!!!

CLIMATE FIRES NEVER EXISTED BEFORE 2 YEARS AGO!!!
312 2018-08-30 23:22:37 So I ask Braxton what the kids at school said today about his new truck and he said with his head hung down they liked it.  I said look at me.  He raised his head and I seen tears began to form I said Braxton what is wrong he said nothing it’s ok, oil said no I want to know....
313 2018-08-30 23:22:18 But oil from the Middle East is 
314 2018-08-30 23:22:03 I just turned 40 and never had one. I am certain I need one. Good luck

320 2018-08-30 23:21:11 Agreed. I have no issue with Albertans, just with the oil industry.
321 2018-08-30 23:21:06 Very happy that @theedpodcast decided that @Stephen_Hurley is legit, not some shyster selling cyber snake oil... at least, not through the week... and came on board with @voicEdcanada

329 2018-08-30 23:19:20 The way Alberta is treated is horrendous. The federal government & provinces block every opportunity for Alberta to expand the oil industry, strangle Alberta economically, & deny Albertans prosperity, yet are glad to take billions from Alberta in transfer payments. Despicable.
330 2018-08-30 23:19:19 All I can say is 10 liters of oil moe 
331 2018-08-30 23:19:12 This whole thing has become so laughable.

When Max hired Walsh I immediately thought "Uh oh, this will be oil and water with how the Habs like to keep EVERYTHING internal." Should have checked to see what the Vegas odds of conflict showing up were 
332 2018-08-30 23:18:51 Canada's new economy is not based on oil. Businesses internationally are investing heavily in Canada which is why economy is doing so well, including in Alberta. Market for #Tarsands oil is drying up because there's no future in it and it's incredibly expensive to produce.
333 2018-08-30 23:18:48 Ridiculous! Big win for atrocious human rights violating countries to keep having their oil imported.
334 2018-08-30 23:18:44 It means we keep importing oil.
335 2018-08-30 23:18:39 Did you replace the oil filter. It easy to forget to do that
336 2018-08-30 23:18:29 Someone convinced my mom to start my brother on medical Marijuana oil or cannabis oil as the bottle reads and dude is busy having munchies, making noises here.
I can't wait to be healthy again.
Dude is Err high.
337 2018-08-30 23:18:25 My nigga gone walk me through how to change my oil and next time around I’m gonna completely do it myself 
338 2018-08-30 23:18:15 Cool down, bread no dey back o it be fried egg. Nkosua ni oil 3ghc plus delivery 5ghc 
339 2018-08-30 23:18:10 My love and appreciation for coconut oil is unmatched.
340 2018-08-30 23:17:51 lol that is ridiculous.  a tailings pond is a settling pond.  oil sands producers take all kinds of strict precautions to protect groundwater and fresh water.
341 2018-08-30 23:17:46 Gavin Newsom is going to be the next governor.  You and I both know that.  It's either him (swarmy snake oil salesman) or the carpetbagger who moved to California because he couldn't get elected in his home state.
342 2018-08-30 23:17:45 Ha ha ha! The oil has run out & the parts are squeaking 
343 2018-08-30 23:17:43 @AngusforMaine @chelliepingree Heating oil is 70 cents a gallon more than it was last year at this time. That means 100 gallons will cost $70 more this year. Meanwhile, Texas Gulf Coast exports more oil than it imports for the first time this year Ain't America great again HELP
344 2018-08-30 23:17:42 I hate to break your heart, but (so far)Jim Harbaugh is a slightly better version of Butch Jones. Not as much snake oil salesman and somewhat better results...but it’s sadly similar. @SGSFOX @HeyGorman
345 2018-08-30 23:17:35 Hi-larious that #notley is being branded as having anything to do with the “left wing”. She’s been in the pocket of the Oil lobby since day 1 as premier. She will go down the way that all people tend to when they abandon their soul. #cdnpoli
346 2018-08-30 23:17:19 Come and rub oil or powder for me
347 2018-08-30 23:17:06 Explain how moving our oil on trunks and trains and not pipelines solves climate change (as Canada does contribute 2% of the world’s CO2)
348 2018-08-30 23:17:06 Awesome - thanks! I’ve heard of the evening primrose oil and black cohosh. I haven’t been having issues during the night but it sure gets annoying during the day at work.
349 2018-08-30 23:17:05 my mom is home til sunday and she brought me CBD oil from west virginia 
350 2018-08-30 23:17:04 but the world isn't at this point. Oil use is going up. Even if Canada goes down it won't impact the world much. It would have to a collective effort across the world. I agree other options need to be strongly considered as energy sources.
351 2018-08-30 23:16:49 Waaahhh "Hair Oil"
352 2018-08-30 23:16:45 How dumb does an entire government have to be to not think more oil to tidewater, meant more tanker traffic? This government crafted the entire outcome. They are scuttling the ship called Canada. Remember where his Sr. advisers came from.
353 2018-08-30 23:16:45 OMG that was so dumb. I used to think the Trudeau disaster in India and their pushing of 'progressive' trade policies to authoritarian regimes (Trump & China) was whacked, but the way Scheer just described the oil sands is just as out to lunch. Please guys, find some good staff.
354 2018-08-30 23:16:32 If @ChibuikeAmaechi break ur heart in @APCNigeria R/S Na oil spillage. @PetersideDakuku @kairos ur time was #then. #gubernatorial #candidate #favours #TDC @saharaenergy
355 2018-08-30 23:16:28 Daiel, patron of the candelabra and manbuns and angel of oil
356 2018-08-30 23:16:09 There is a very finite amount of oil, coal, and natural gas. Wind and solar energy are both driven by the sun. We need to plan for the long term and not continue on this dead end path
357 2018-08-30 23:16:05 Any educated man should know already that to change things, you should kill the demand and not the supply. Just idiot politics that's all.
When you manage to stop manufacturing gas powered vehicles, no one will need the oil anymore.
358 2018-08-30 23:16:03 That great “duncess” thinks that she will just snap her fingers and all use of hydrocarbons will disappear. Or maybe she thinks oil and gas will be phased out but is happy to encourage the industry until it no longer suits her purpose. She’s as hypocritical as it gets. #cdnpoli
359 2018-08-30 23:15:56 Check your Engine oil this morning.
360 2018-08-30 23:15:47 I used CBD oil once and don’t have any seizures!

363 2018-08-30 23:15:23 Steve, if we're going to nationalize any commodity let's start with the oil industry first. What's that I hear? Crickets?

370 2018-08-30 23:14:55 If we truly want to come up with alternative energy systems, we need cash for r&d. Sell the oil, brings revenue from oil sales, business investment and taxes; be world leaders in everything energy. Wind and solar are not it no matter how bad we want it, not in current form anyway
371 2018-08-30 23:14:14 Big thanks to the guys at @jiffylube store 2736 in Apex. They knocked out an oil change and state inspection even though they were about to close for the evening. They stayed late just to finish my car.  Thank you!

373 2018-08-30 23:14:08 Interesting water disappears  when you comment floods. Fires happen from lightning and people who set them and because the Liberal government cut funding for fire breaks and fire fighters. The world isn’t tuned perfect, things happen for reasons and it’s not because Oil
374 2018-08-30 23:14:08 おにいちゃんだいすきなじろ~ｸﾝにはたまたまｻﾏﾄｷｻﾏとおにいちゃんがｾｯｸｽしてるところに出会って絶望しろっておもってる
375 2018-08-30 23:13:57 I would imagine it’s not that bad, really. They use it to clean birds after oil spills, so it will remove all the makeup from the brushes, AND you won’t get those damn dish pan hands! Lol
376 2018-08-30 23:13:52 The only boycott I'm sticking to is Exxon. I was born in Alaska, and the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989 was disastrous to the wildlife and coastal environment. I don't hold many grudges, but this one still hurts.
377 2018-08-30 23:13:49 eso se sabia pura estafa de este bagazo de gobierno
378 2018-08-30 23:13:49 Got my oil changeddd , I feel so much betterrrr
379 2018-08-30 23:13:48 ７月１０日はオイルの日。 
雑学記
「７１０」を逆さにすると「ＯＩＬ」に見えるから。

OIL！
380 2018-08-30 23:13:39 I love clean tech, but it's not a clean comparison unless you're including storage / dispatchability.

Conversely, could also include health care costs of extracting the oil and due to air quality degradation of the petrol-powered vehicles.
381 2018-08-30 23:13:37 No kidding.  Trumpistan wants to eliminate regulations for pollution from oil companies and coal--eliminate regulations for clean water and clean air and wildlife ... But then where they want regulation is with free speech and internet marketing.  
Sounds like Communists to me.
382 2018-08-30 23:13:35 I have to give @WholeFoods credit. Every single store has the same smell of what I can only imagine is patchouli oil and black pepper
383 2018-08-30 23:13:26 SAME. I love olive oil but I’m pretty sure olives themselves are basically one of Trump’s horcruxes.
384 2018-08-30 23:13:16 We need to start keeping more of our money. Let the oil rich Arabs take care of their own for awhile.

386 2018-08-30 23:13:07 @Friendlys so you guys don’t put one of the allergens as peanuts on your special editon Oreo ice cream cake yet it contains highly refined peanut oil? many like myself with severe allergies would have a life threatening reaction. shame on your manufacturing practices!
387 2018-08-30 23:13:06 Huge victory.... more oil on trains now 
388 2018-08-30 23:12:39 Whatever they claim to believe, it’s all really about power, money and oil. If these people really believed in their professed religions they’d honour “thou shalt not kill” wouldnt they?
389 2018-08-30 23:12:33 Chief Stewart of BC Indians Union mentions his disapproval of Kinder Morgan, but fails to mention tankers of oil going up & down the coast, Stewart also mentions his concern for Orca’s but not a word of Vancouver & Victoria dumping billions of litres of raw sewage into the ocean
390 2018-08-30 23:12:32 I was coveted in acetone for a bit but I think oil is worse
391 2018-08-30 23:12:30 To replace oil?  There are huge technological capacity and production problems.  They tried this in Ontario and still had to keep a high power baseline production using nat gas Gen. so we got no benefit, ugly windmills and $800 month electricity bills.
392 2018-08-30 23:12:28 Oil is instead being transported by rail which is extremely unsafe, along with more being produced in Saudi Arabia that is consumed in Canada. How is this so hard to understand? Building the pipeline is the green thing to do.
393 2018-08-30 23:12:18 @GreaseMonkeyInt is winning the oil change war -one freshly baked chocolate chip cookie at a time. #checkmate #ThursdayThoughts #genius #Businessplan #corporate
394 2018-08-30 23:12:07 So I go to @pepboysauto to have my oil changed. As I leave, I realize I have low tire pressure. Semi-annoyed. So I go to the Shell station at lunch to fill up my tires and go back to work. I get to the parking garage and see I have a flat tire. Irony or bad karma?
395 2018-08-30 23:11:59 I have the dumbest bf on this planet. Sent him to take my car for an oil change $2,000 later he still at the shop tryna make sure there’s nothing wrong with the car. All it needed was a mf oil change.
396 2018-08-30 23:11:59 what they're doing to Syria is nothing less than murder. this isn't about finding terrorist this is about taking control of that territory and oil. It's murder and if you're participating in it your a murderer killing innocent kids women and men
397 2018-08-30 23:11:58 Y'all should've started boycotting In-N-Out the moment they dipped cardboard slices in hot sunflower oil and tried to convince us that they were fries. 
398 2018-08-30 23:11:54 Oh I need WAY more than an oil change. I need body work bad
399 2018-08-30 23:11:53 Don't most places buy our crappy crude at a lower price cuz it needs special refining? We then buy it back once processed. This expansion of an American pipeline will let us dump more in the market -so yes wider reach- but does our dirty oil even compete w higher grade oil?
400 2018-08-30 23:11:49 Taxation is theft?  Seriously?  So you don’t like roads, libraries, storm water management, police?  And you like subsidizing big oil?
401 2018-08-30 23:11:39 Bro I’m chillin watching space jam on YouTube vaping a lil oil

414 2018-08-30 23:10:19 Not entirely accurate, a pipeline already exists and is pumping oil, it's the expansion of it that seems pretty much dead in the water now. We didn't end up with nothing for that now obvious overpayment, but we definitely didn't get what was advertised for the money, either.
415 2018-08-30 23:10:16 知ってる？スーパーってタダで牛脂くれるんだよ。
416 2018-08-30 23:10:15 To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it
417 2018-08-30 23:10:01 Oh how wonderful that the Sierra Club & it’s American funding can take time out to celebrate while the rest of us work to pay for the foreign oil brought here by tanker trucks & passing through communities on rail. #losers #hypicrites #cndpoli #KinderMorgan

420 2018-08-30 23:09:42 Agreed. And I’ve always said: Big Oil killed the electric car. No more complex than that. No conspiracy theories needed. But EVs and Elon are prevailing.
421 2018-08-30 23:09:41 I don’t get it either. If it’s cold, you can wear more. If it’s hot, you could strip naked, and still be a miserable pile of sweat and oil.
422 2018-08-30 23:09:39 I don't know Sass...
You "imagination engine" is slinging a lot of oil this afternoon...
 

If the debate formats (formal & informal), with increased candidates
would just be a lot of noise & voters wouldn't get any useful INFO.
423 2018-08-30 23:08:55 My mom has cancer and never did marijuana in her life. A few years ago she tried the heavy duty marijuana oil delivered straight from Canada. It helped her while she was on it but she didn’t like the non-stop high, but her health did improve while being on it.
424 2018-08-30 23:08:53 I've suffering with chronic headaches since I was like 11 so I feel your pain. For stress try relaxing music stations,  take a bath, and the oil I told you about
425 2018-08-30 23:08:49 Did you make this? 
I effing love it.
426 2018-08-30 23:08:47 ありがとうございます
427 2018-08-30 23:08:47 Too fast to spill the oil 
428 2018-08-30 23:08:44 I have a question for you. Is the oil that comes into Canadian ports from other countries special oil? Does it not make a mess if one of those ships has a spill?? Does only ethically produced Canadian oil cause an environmental disaster if spilled?
429 2018-08-30 23:08:43 My point is Scheer’s statement is incorrect. It only makes sense if one substitutes ‘oil’ for ‘energy’. Using energy in the original tweet is a way of obscuring alternate possible sources of energy besides O&G.
430 2018-08-30 23:08:39 I just sloshed a wave of really hot oil over my wrist while cooking... do not recommend... >.<
431 2018-08-30 23:08:39 Hi Briar. Thanks very much for taking time to reply. Most Canadians are not aware that there is a sophisticated campaign to keep Canadian oil out of overseas markets. Would be great if CBC would cover this. Maybe at #AtIssue panel? @RosieBarton @acoyne @CBCTheNational
432 2018-08-30 23:08:38 I have bulged discs lower and upper back and neck pinching nerves- causing headaches, and didn't get any relief from the hemp oil  I take 3 Aleve a day and go to chiropractor as needed. The VA took my pain meds because I also take adderall for add...
433 2018-08-30 23:08:33 What’s your solution?  End fossil fuel consumption?  Wind and solar cannot replace oil.  Not even close.  You’re just putting oil on trucks and trains and helping the head chopping women hating Saudis
434 2018-08-30 23:08:33 TMX doesn't just ship bitumen, it ships refined products plus all types of crude oil to the lower mainland, including the gasoline Vancouver uses. Time to shut the supply it off? I vote yes.
435 2018-08-30 23:08:31 We share your environmental concerns and as such, have for many years been members of the Roundtable for #Sustainable #PalmOil.  We use only #RSPO-certified, sustainably sourced palm oil in our products.
436 2018-08-30 23:08:11 YT historian - seems neutral but right-leaning - showed vid of VN high-cost tar oil industry. Chavez did not nationalize PSVDA.
When >60-100/bbl, excess $ for socialism vs give to oligarchs. Makes sense?
Insuff time to dev domestic inputs (chem & equip)? (IP restrictions?)
437 2018-08-30 23:08:05 Remember it very well. My Dads panel truck was covered with oil from one of the explosions. Suck in the polluted air for about three days. Plus it was covered live by KTLA.
438 2018-08-30 23:08:01 Risk and stress aren't concrete resources to draw material wealth from. Stock is worth what other people decide it's worth. It's not gold, it's not oil. I know because I've reaped the benefits from stock investing. It's insane, and I'm extremely lucky to have "earned" it.
439 2018-08-30 23:08:01 can we just take a moment to appreciate god giving me a Taco Bell , a Dunkin’ Donuts AND a hemp store that sells CBD oil RIGHT NEXT TO MY INTERNSHIP
440 2018-08-30 23:08:00 Oil is over 70 again.
441 2018-08-30 23:07:42 When you return point out the oil tankers in the link that you provided so that you can explain how Blair's statistics are wrong.

443 2018-08-30 23:07:17 1 Tim 5:13 The LORD be darkness, and hath covered my head with oil for light, And the shekel of the tree of the land.
444 2018-08-30 23:07:15 Settle down. Oil will always find a way to market. Again maybe we should refine our own resources or ship east and refine here. Resource and financial independence
445 2018-08-30 23:06:59 Actually the reasons are the defense has been horrendous all the year. The offense has been offensive. And now the pitching is leaking serious oil
446 2018-08-30 23:06:56 This is forty too late.
447 2018-08-30 23:06:41 just as by geography vagaries you happen to live in a landlocked province, does not mean you can ride roughshot over the rights and concerns of those who live in a province adjacent to water.

remember exxon valdez?
448 2018-08-30 23:06:34 A reminder. The atmosphere and the laws of physics, chemistry, and biology don't much care if oil industry propagandists use the term 'ethical.' CO2 has the same effect no matter who emits it.

452 2018-08-30 23:05:36 Consultation doesn’t equal veto. And that’s what they want.   But stop the pipeline, put it on the trains and plug your ears when the facts come out about pipelines being the safest form of oil transportation.
453 2018-08-30 23:05:36 Under fossil-fuel fan Andrew Wheeler, Trump's EPA will "revisit" Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, or MATS, which cut air emissions + pollutants like mercury from coal + oil power plants.

What fuel source will future generations use if we burn all the coal and oil over the next 50 years?
478 2018-08-30 23:02:53 Could it be that the idea that Canada’s oil is ethical is about as useful to solving this problem as is the idea that carbon taxes buy social license?

It isn't my fault they chose to die on a pipeline hill instead of social democracy

541 2018-08-30 22:56:50 Once again, the oil and gas industry in Canada is an ideology more than anything else.

549 2018-08-30 22:56:28 Once again, Jason, you’ve missed the point. Rail, pipelines, whatever, it isn’t about the mode of transportation. The opponents want no oil moved. With your astuteness, you’ll really show everybody when and if you become Premier. Or not. #cdnpoli
550 2018-08-30 22:56:25 I put pure lavender essential oil on and it seems to work pretty well. And it smells good.
551 2018-08-30 22:56:23 @oil_saburo 

おめラジラです
552 2018-08-30 22:56:02 Paul, are you really so ignorant to the fact that oil is going Nowhere.  It is a part of  most things you use everyday. And how do you think Lithium is mined? By solar power? Lithium mining for electric vehicles etc. look as environmentally friendly  as strip mining for gold.
553 2018-08-30 22:55:57 大人の男にはfatty oil(脂肪油)が必要なんだ　シャイニング･ジャスティス　オレはロム
554 2018-08-30 22:55:46 Need more players to join European leagues, no chase oil money
555 2018-08-30 22:55:34 The oil is going to come out of the ground and move regardless. Lets do it as safely as possible and start some green initiatives to cushion the Alberta economy when oil is done as well. Baby steps.
556 2018-08-30 22:55:31 Marcus, I don't know if I sent this.
VN must buy oil inputs w Frgn Res (debt) (not Bolivar). Sell at >55/bbl.
Oil <55 for yrs.
VN diverted oil maint $ to socialist progs. Same as Alaska, but appry TOO MUCH after price drop.
Ergo, oil equip in poor shape & Frgn Res gone. (1 story)
557 2018-08-30 22:55:24 feta spinach olive oil flatbread (?)
558 2018-08-30 22:55:23 If I don’t get my oil changed soon my cars going to blow up
559 2018-08-30 22:55:20 Cleanest oil extraction yes.   I guess you think the Russian oil is cleaner
560 2018-08-30 22:55:15 Founded in 1881, Odessa is rich in history, oil and natural gas, Texas culture, the arts, and the dynamic Friday night lights of hometown football.
561 2018-08-30 22:55:13 Woooo I use too many. I love my Marc Jacobs shameless though. And I also love my cover fx natural finish. And the new it cosmetics oil free matte cc foundation
562 2018-08-30 22:55:13 Historical linguists in 2700 are going to really enjoy learning about “easy peasy lemon squeezy.”

Then they’ll go back to swimming in 5-Dimensional tanks of digital oil or whatever they do to have fun in the non-linear cloud.
563 2018-08-30 22:55:06 i just saw this woman put olive oil on her pizza hut and now im disturbed
564 2018-08-30 22:55:02 My dad still dreams of McDonalds fries cooked in peanut oil back in the day. Now he says he can’t stand they way they stink because of the vegetable oil.
565 2018-08-30 22:54:57 We’ve already established who is not a conservative. It’s you and your phony snake oil salesman on the WH. You dopes can’t even define conservatism which is both sad funny at the same time. Educate yourself or stay home.
566 2018-08-30 22:54:55 Is that money ear marked for sidewalks and bike paths around the oil rigs? And shouldn't some of it go to locate bear dens so you can shoot the mother bears and cubs while they're vulnerable? For conservation of course.
567 2018-08-30 22:54:49 Three bodies found in Colorado two in oil drums (kids 3-4 years old) and mother / wife murdered by white male.
So explain your lack of outrage on this. Keep on the agenda Trump is watching.
568 2018-08-30 22:54:41 Why do you suppose the foolish virgins don’t bring enough oil to last them until the Bridegroom comes? Had they brought more, they would have been wise virgins. I think their apostasy is a different cause than hypocrisy in the previous parable.
569 2018-08-30 22:54:32 Oil Can Harry's
570 2018-08-30 22:54:30 Weell the environmentally way was tried and failed so fuck ‘em. Get a bunch of train cars. We still got oil to get to tidewater but now it’s gotta go in 40 foot sections on top of the earth & water & through the towns.
571 2018-08-30 22:54:25 Since you tryna get into the beard gang, use castor oil on your face and make sure you massage it to stimulate the follicles to help it grow faster.
572 2018-08-30 22:54:19 Let’s help the railroads move more oil. Screw the enviro-nuts and FN. Use whatever means necessary to move our oil to market, especially if it means neither group can stop it. Hell, AB should buy tanker cars for CN and CP rail
573 2018-08-30 22:53:58 where can i get a good oil change from 
574 2018-08-30 22:53:30 I understand your statement. Are you telling me that Venezuela and Saudi oil have no climate impact? Are we holding those countries to the same ethical standards that we are holding Canada to?
575 2018-08-30 22:53:28 Does duty to consult imply squeaky wheel veto?  “Social licence?”   “Right wing nut”Obama allowed thousands of miles of US pipe line expansion.  But we can’t let it happen in Canada. Put the oil on the trans Canada, load up the trains, bring in more Saudi oil.  Much better?
576 2018-08-30 22:53:25 It’s time for anti oil to step up and leave all products  behind the need oil in some way shape or form. There would be a lot of hungry naked people living out side.
577 2018-08-30 22:53:18 Even Karen Oil wouldn’t be so brazen. 

Well, that’s not true.
578 2018-08-30 22:53:16 Some of the leading low emission tech is coming from the oil companies. Europeans will not let corporations destroy us all. World Wars did not neither will greedy oil barons
579 2018-08-30 22:52:54 If corn oil is made from corn and vegetable oil is made from vegetables. What is baby oil made from?
580 2018-08-30 22:52:47 I use the Honest Amish beard oil and it's also great. I can attest to all of the above
581 2018-08-30 22:52:47 Which shows your overall ignorance of the situation. Not insulting you here. It doesn't need to be gas or oil for the car. Its the manufacturing and production that give off way more than your little car....
582 2018-08-30 22:52:43 I need a full body massage with warm oil like uh yeaaaa
583 2018-08-30 22:52:42 @TriggLogan just said that my essential oil diffuser is basically like a vape...? 
584 2018-08-30 22:52:41 Ok well lemme help you out, get’chi some Jamaican black castor oil
585 2018-08-30 22:52:41 Btw potatoes fried in olive oil

588 2018-08-30 22:52:09 Coconut Oil solves everything
589 2018-08-30 22:52:07 I am FED UP with asserting rights. Plus if BC lived entirely off the land then I get it but we do not. How else do you propose oil gets transported!!! Glad you going to help put BC in a recession as the world is watching and being told DO NOT INVEST IN CANADA. Idiots.
590 2018-08-30 22:51:52 CBD oil still hasn't reached the stage of non-prescription in my red neck of the woods. 
591 2018-08-30 22:51:38 so it is true that a man changing your oil is attractive as fuck
592 2018-08-30 22:51:37 If people refuse to work for 13 bucks an hour, companies will automatically be forced to pay more. In North Dakota during the oil boom, McDonald workers were being paid 18 bucks and hour. Because everyone else was working the oil patch at that or even higher salaries.
593 2018-08-30 22:51:34 Also it was oil in one of those vape things. So maybe its different like that.
594 2018-08-30 22:51:27 Since traditional medicine has felt like an unhelpful waste of money for me lately I ordered a bottle of cbd oil and a handful of healing crystals...let’s get weird!
595 2018-08-30 22:51:26 Hmm..makes me wonder ...there were 3 areas that were potential to yoons...the oil..his place...the banks Lab Ian Ratbag Murry..and the Borders...head chief Tory...Mundell...we know all about the vote rigging...dark money and fucking pure affontery ...that these cunts got thru
596 2018-08-30 22:51:24 I still have a few $25.00 gift cards to get cbd oil or our new Blackseed oil Entourage and we have many other great things :)
597 2018-08-30 22:51:17 Ofcourse they think they are smart we go and buy their oil in cents and come and resell to them 100% higher nice one let them pray bottoms up
598 2018-08-30 22:51:13 there was never any leadership in the #transmountain fiasco, it was only ever the @liberal_party submitting to the oil industry demands, at any and all costs. let's hope they pay a dear price next election
599 2018-08-30 22:51:11 I do have a coffee mug of the mixed above ground veggies to balance everything.. Two palm size grass fed steak, 3 slices of hand made bacon n two softly boiled free range eggs.. veggies mildly stir fried with all the spices mentioned in poison coconut oil.
600 2018-08-30 22:51:09 For years to come, calling bitumen the "cleanest, most ethical, environmentally-friendly energy in the world" (sic), will define #ScheerLunacy. Even people who build pipelines and own oil fields will tell you it's not true, in the least.

You didn't even SKIM his blog.

Please point out the OIL TANKER in the link you provided.

"Blog post by OilCo propagandist."  Resorting to ad homs now.  Time to admit that you've surrendered the intellectual high ground.
604 2018-08-30 22:50:49 I’m craving TFC scotch egg. 

At 11:50pm. Abeg let me go and look for anointing oil to avoid stories that touch. 
605 2018-08-30 22:50:35 Marijuana made me hungry, lazy, horny, and paranoid. I wonder if Cannibus oil would be different and helpful for me. Going to see a new psychiatrist tomorrow and changing meds for the zillionth time. I’m so tired of it. Willing to try anything. I’m glad you found relief
606 2018-08-30 22:50:30 Japan itself is crazy for beef- however they eat it very differently -intestines, stomachs  lips, ears, NOTHING is wasted . Unfortunately they also got the bug for instant pot noodles  big time , ramen seed oil and additives  & vending machnes on all street corners.
607 2018-08-30 22:50:30 So states the man who tells more lies per minute than a snake oil salesman.
608 2018-08-30 22:50:18 Oil cant done!!! :)
609 2018-08-30 22:50:05 oh btw, that coconut cleaning oil I bought, I don't think it's working for me. No nothing literally. Can I donate my skincare?

613 2018-08-30 22:49:54 trudeau's incompetence by land locking our oil to appease radicals in Quebec and BC - I am hearing lots of people call for Alberta separation and join the US, paying Canada $200B has got us nothing but headaches @sunlornegunter @ABSeparatist @ABSeparation @LiciaCorbella #Alberta
614 2018-08-30 22:49:48 When Ovi plays long shifts on PP they say he’s selfish...... I say he scores goals. 

I’m with you.
615 2018-08-30 22:49:26 Actually it does mean oil.  If wind and solar could replace oil it would have.   And our grid would crash in a day if we switched to all electric cars
616 2018-08-30 22:49:11 Vulcanism does not create fossil fuels! Deposition, covering up with sediment, more pressure etc causes coal and oil to form. Our use of fossil fuels can be considered equal to planet wide vulcanism just from the sheer rate!

618 2018-08-30 22:49:08 Wee need healthcare that covers ALL Americans & ONLY Americans & we can add LEGAL tourists & Immigrants  (NOT illegals) MC Cain killed that dream. It would have cost NOTHIN as ANWR Oil is 70 BILLION a year in revenue. We could have covered ALL & LOWERED taxes

621 2018-08-30 22:48:48 Gary. There is nothing clean ethical or environmental about Saudi oil.
622 2018-08-30 22:48:45 Governments need to learn to pivot. With US shutting its doors, Canada should look at doing more with its resources than simply shipping them away.

Vancouver airport shouldn't buy US fuel made with Gateway oil. Take the money, build a refinery, flood market with finished product
623 2018-08-30 22:48:44 Just so we’re clear. I’m pro clean resources. I would rather the world be supplied with cleaner oil from here instead of somewhere like Saudi. Opposing a Canadian pipeline - which means more oil from other less responsible producers - is not only ironic, it’s irresponsible
624 2018-08-30 22:48:40 Human oil spill 
625 2018-08-30 22:48:25 magos no hay y sin dinero imposible y los contratos de reactivacion de pozos contienen tantos bericuetos que no habran insumos suficientes para realizar esos trabajos.
626 2018-08-30 22:48:20 Conservatives will literally bitch at Trudeau even when he does a Conservative thing like buy a Oil pipeline which I am not for even though it will bring in jobs and so forth but Trudeau I know it’s a political move for Election but your supposed to be a environmentalist #Trudeau
627 2018-08-30 22:48:17 The nigga I ditched at this wedding that I went to is at the oil change place  how awkward
628 2018-08-30 22:48:13 I’ve been vamping CBD oil on my stressful day/ to help me sleep and honestly it really is helping me. Also you can get it without nicotine like I do if your a non smoker
629 2018-08-30 22:48:08 Unfortunately it's more about weapons sales & keeping a proxy, warmongering state happy, than oil (which BTW is less & less of importance to the US as its energy dependence on imported oil diminishes year after year).

Also, US foreign policy NEVER had anything to do w/ HR. 
630 2018-08-30 22:48:04 Also curious what the stats are about the amount of full oil tanker cars that are sent West compared to fuel cars sent the other way. How many per day?
631 2018-08-30 22:47:57 Not to mention, you smell like cooking oil for hours after you leave!
632 2018-08-30 22:47:37 Using an oil as a makeup remover is life changing hollllllllyyyyyy
633 2018-08-30 22:47:34 Grape seed oil bad?? #askdolce @TheDolceDiet #confussed
634 2018-08-30 22:47:33 If conservatives want stuff to “be the way it was,” they better give up their alliance with the oil and coal industry because little is bringing radical change like global warming.
635 2018-08-30 22:47:27 There's zero comparison in this article and it isn't even linked to the study.  All it says is that the oil sands are in fact a source of pollution which nobody is arguing with. Still cleaner than Nigeria, Iraq, Iran, Saudi, Qatar, Abu Dhabi, Algeria, where there is zero regs.
636 2018-08-30 22:47:20 How do I get a poster for my oil room
637 2018-08-30 22:47:12 I’m not going to be a good father until I learn what to do after I dip that oil stick in the car and look at it.
638 2018-08-30 22:47:07 It's literally not POSSIBLE to divest from oil products as a consumer. We want to change that.
639 2018-08-30 22:47:02 Actually need to remember and put oil in my car in the morning 
640 2018-08-30 22:46:51 And the rail lines don’t want to move anything BUT oil.  So it’s hurting other industry. Not just energy at stake here.
641 2018-08-30 22:46:41 Try using the fabric safe oil. That’s what I did and never bought a presser foot. Or I use tissue paper. It’s super difficult though.
642 2018-08-30 22:46:31 Fact check: Cruz exploded the deficit and now federal workers in #Texas face a pay freeze while big oil profits skyrocket.
643 2018-08-30 22:46:19 @CLewandowski_ said last night on CNN Americans are better off today then 2 years ago. I am not better off today. My wages haven’t changed,  food ,gas,oil,heat more expensive.  I am NOT better off? You mean only rich ppl who can play the market are better off another Trump loser
644 2018-08-30 22:46:17 Frying a sausage in oil, looked down at it in the pan and said "what is this potato even doing"

645 2018-08-30 22:46:10 If being in the @BosPublicMarket for 10 mins makes my hair & clothes smell like cooking oil, I know I can’t buy things like yarn or gifts there, which is super disappointing. Really wish they could figure something out!
646 2018-08-30 22:46:07 U just need that castor oil hair growth serum and massage the hair follicles. u will be straight with the new mustache hair in 6 months

648 2018-08-30 22:45:34 we see every day from you, against pretty much everyone who isn't buying your snake oil.  Your efforts to divide get stronger, as more stories you just don't like...they're not fake, you're feelings are hurt by the truth.  Don't worry, we all know you're a criminal....
649 2018-08-30 22:45:29 Iraq was a threat to the entire Middle East which would have imperiled the world economy via oil.  Of course it was going to be dealt with.  Interesting that u would have so much sympathy for a guy like Saddam Hussein.
650 2018-08-30 22:45:11 I had 1 avocado and a tea spoon of the recently demonized coconut oil regularly for breakfast for a couple of months and it did wonders! I should've recorded the process.
651 2018-08-30 22:45:02 Stupidly sat in front of the a/c at the oil change place. But there are other people here and I'm too stubborn to admit I made a mistake and switch seats.

656 2018-08-30 22:44:29 But palm oil in every one- that’s why I stopped eating/buying them
657 2018-08-30 22:44:23 They want to stop the oil workers because they are terrorising the hippies with small car bombs and CHERUB are afraid they might do worse.

658 2018-08-30 22:44:22 US must stop blackmailing oil countries
659 2018-08-30 22:44:22 Not to mention, if we were consuming domestic oil in eastern Canada instead of importing it, that also would substantially strengthen the loonie. Reducing inflation and hence interest rates. At a time when the economy is struggling to grow.

662 2018-08-30 22:44:11 Funny, but I would have never guessed you were such a big Trump fan. Definitely a huge win for Trump's America who gets to continue buying Canadian oil at a steep discount and resell it to us.
663 2018-08-30 22:43:53 さまいち好きだな…
664 2018-08-30 22:43:24 Maybe Dr. Oz and Walter Willet of Harvard should stop recommending it... I'm guessing they are sponsored by corn oil makers.
665 2018-08-30 22:43:23 The only thing stopping pipelines does is increase rail traffic. Less safe and more energy intensive. A developed country shipping oil by rail...
666 2018-08-30 22:43:15 The problem was the hippies wanted to kill the oil rig owners. Cherub had to stop the hippies from blowing a oil rig company’s building up.

670 2018-08-30 22:42:15 And how happy are you that the #TransMountainPipeline oil will be trucked and trained thru #Canadian backyards across the country? I'm sure Lac-Mégantic residents would have something to say.
671 2018-08-30 22:42:09 I drink it and rub you down with oil. 
672 2018-08-30 22:42:07 Hey @Ocasio2018 @SenSanders this is what you want to bring here.  And look... they want to fix it by drilling for oil!!  @algore any comments for your comrades in the Democratic Party?

677 2018-08-30 22:41:16 I'm now using high potency CBD oil as unregulated marijuana is expensive and CBD oil has been recently legalised in the UK.
I only started using cannabis on the recommendation of a consultant doctor originally anyway.

680 2018-08-30 22:40:55 It is so damn obvious it drives me crazy no one is talking about this! Trade war pushing US growers out of global market, Russian grain prices go up with demand. Iran oil embargo by US, Russian oil is also in more demand. SO OBVIOUS IT"S CRIMINAL!!!

684 2018-08-30 22:40:45 The Conservatives are also to blame. They stacked the energy board with big oil people who wilfully failed to do their due diligence in the hopes of pushing through a bad project.
685 2018-08-30 22:40:31 Tooo Nissan 1 hour 43 mins and 40 sum secs fa a oil change 
686 2018-08-30 22:40:31 I suggest you sell everything you have and invest in sustainable energy. I also suggest that government subsidies be removed (from all including oil). Then I suggest you be prepared to be poor for many decades.

688 2018-08-30 22:40:13 I used vegetable oil once I learned that hair conditioner doesn't yield much glidiness
689 2018-08-30 22:40:13 Canadian oil extraction standards are world class. Wind (nobody includes the impact of building the turbines) and solar are not ready to replace fossil fuels.  If we leave our oil in the ground we will use dirtier Iran/Venezuela crude. Why did Obama build 1000s of km of pipeline?
690 2018-08-30 22:40:11 Memory lane - 1940's oil filter sign! #TBT
691 2018-08-30 22:40:11 Where did the money and oil go????
692 2018-08-30 22:40:07 これはおっぱいじゃなくて油の貯蔵庫だよ。最悪の事態の時はここから、ね。
693 2018-08-30 22:40:06 PUT SOME CASTOR OIL ON IT !! IT WILL GROW FASTER
694 2018-08-30 22:40:05 And bringing back manufacturing, increasing our oil, steel, and coal production, etc. etc.
But yeah, stripping assets...smh.
695 2018-08-30 22:40:04 To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it
696 2018-08-30 22:39:49 You want to trust our oil markets to the Americans?  The Ralph Wiggum of the developed world?

702 2018-08-30 22:39:11 Jojoba oil is literally the best thing ever
703 2018-08-30 22:39:02 As an aboriginal Canadian and Alberta Oil Patch Brat I say Flush It, and if you could do the same for Justin and the Liberal Party, That would be great.
704 2018-08-30 22:38:10 YA if you like. take away or add moisture in the same way too consistently your face will learn to over/underproduce oil i know that one
705 2018-08-30 22:38:01 Stop saying "we" and "us" when talking about Alberta's oil.     

There is no we or us when Alberta's tarsands is privatized.
706 2018-08-30 22:37:47 If Canadians don’t want or care about its oil and gas resources then we should exclude it from the calculations in the equalization formula.
707 2018-08-30 22:37:44 There is 2 places we can get the CBD Oil  near us
708 2018-08-30 22:37:42 Why is it great for the environment??
The oil will now be trained and trucked.
That is shitty for the environment.

Not having export terminals and tankers on the Strait is probably for the best, but that is a separate issue.
709 2018-08-30 22:37:36 Many on this thread conflating so called renewables with world oil market.  Wind & solar r unreliable and cannot power a grid and r an expensive dirty add on to reliable nuclear, hydro, natural gas or coal base power.  TMX is to sell our oil at world prices not to US at discount.
710 2018-08-30 22:37:10 Imma stop flaming @curaleaffl. Yeah I feel super jipped by the THC-Indica oil and THC-Indica pills. Then the only thing that worked was the plastic tasting vape. Yes I held the oil under my tongue. I put 15 dropper fulls in my mouth. Nothing no results.

713 2018-08-30 22:36:54 So guys let me tell y’all why I’m stressing. I am a full time student with a internship with a oil company and then I work at Pizza Hut in the afternoon. Someone give me a massage
714 2018-08-30 22:36:45 I hate plain mayo but the more words you put I front of it the better it seems. For example: avocado oil Chipotle Lime Mayo
715 2018-08-30 22:36:39 You did NOT make that qualification in your initial tweet - "Investing in Energy is as simple as ABC (Anywhere But Canada)" If you meant  "Investing in oil sands" you might have said that instead. Hyperbole at the least...
716 2018-08-30 22:36:36 Something is badly wrong with you sir.  We didn't hit into recession overnight,  your party laid the foundation,  after squandering oil proceed without saving a dime.  Nigerians knows better know,  stop playing to the gallery.
717 2018-08-30 22:36:24 What motor oil costs $12.50 per quart?
718 2018-08-30 22:35:54 U forgot palm oil
719 2018-08-30 22:35:53 Seems the white stuff follows the oil
720 2018-08-30 22:35:43 Perhaps we could build an independent “oil car” rail line,weld the cars together and pump the oil thru !
721 2018-08-30 22:35:41 God wants to anoint you with fresh oil from heaven, in Jesus' name.  Will you let Him begin that deep work in you?
Its time.
722 2018-08-30 22:35:40 Where’s all the oil $
723 2018-08-30 22:35:37 So, so beautiful!! Make sure you own your oil and gas rights so that you - not someone else - controls what happens on your property. Some folks in SWPA had some tough surprises bc they didn't own them.

727 2018-08-30 22:34:55 I’m finally getting an oil change on my vehicle. It’s been awhile... oops!
728 2018-08-30 22:34:54 If you don’t understand the benefits of getting our oil to market and building infrastructure that creates job, generates wealth in communities and helps eliminate our country’s reliance on foreign oil then you better stick to fruit leather and music
729 2018-08-30 22:34:51 It hit here hard 3/4 years ago. People making bank in the oil industry (and at Muskrat and other Labrador places!) with nothing else to do. And it beat the testing at Alberta work camps. Can't smoke a draw in case they test next week, but can go crazy on the gear.
730 2018-08-30 22:34:42 So are you and your band giving up oil and their products? Because if not Albertans and Canadians are tired of your stance. If the current Alberta gov doesn’t but an energy ban on BC the Next one will. Enjoy your winter
731 2018-08-30 22:34:32 Well as long as you don’t sent that price and currency controls have led to rampant shortages and inflation and nationalising the oil industry has crippled it, then fine.
732 2018-08-30 22:34:19 Havard is there to destroy humanity unless you follow them.. I used to read their online bulletin.. no more.. I’m enjoying my poison coconut oil..
733 2018-08-30 22:34:08 So since we are going to more renewable means, that means we shouldn't sell our oil to others. Sounds pretty dumb sir

735 2018-08-30 22:33:45 The price of oil fell. I have never said that Venezuela's oil reserves have been exhausted.

As far as I understand, the state paid the previous owners. 
@MikePrysner has pointed out that executives tried to halt oil production in order to obstruct the givernment's actions.

739 2018-08-30 22:33:30 Don't stop the court case - it's an important case. It's "Canada's oil" when they want to get it to market, it's Alberta's oil when it comes time to collect the woeful royalties oil companies pay.
740 2018-08-30 22:33:28 This whole tweet is disgusting and makes my skin crawl. Laughing at an overweight woman does not make you more superior than a Liberal.
741 2018-08-30 22:33:19 America didn’t make the Venezuelan govt implement price controls which led to massive shortages or currency controls that led to rampant inflation.
America didn’t make it nationalise it’s oil industry and run it into the ground
742 2018-08-30 22:33:17 Funny, I didn't say anything about banning the use or extraction of oil. I just said that the oil industry shouldn't get billions of dollars¹ of government support each year to prop up their profits.

746 2018-08-30 22:32:49 You CAN use olive oil to replace butter sometimes — NOT WHOLE OLIVES
747 2018-08-30 22:32:46 Yes!! It has sevillanas olives (the green salty ones) and it’s sooo tasty. We also have some really flavorful olive oil so I like to pour over a lil but after toasting it (and it’s really easy to find good produce and ingredients here)
748 2018-08-30 22:32:44 Oprah told me to wipe coconut oil on my bunions and by golly it works like a charm, I will listen to her whatever she tells me to do from now on
749 2018-08-30 22:32:37 As opposed to shipping oil by rail?!
750 2018-08-30 22:32:30 I see alot of people using carrot slices or turkish bread, but I put it on everything (hummous on hsp is god tier). Also off the shelf hummous is too dry which makes it taste bad, you gotta add olive oil and paprika

774 2018-08-30 22:29:44 You have proven you have the interests of oil producers. Now pls prove you are the environmentalist you claim to be. It will take some time to get a new study thru the courts, time you can spend on renewable energy developments. (Y)our future depends on it.
775 2018-08-30 22:29:41 The problem with fort harmony is that the hippies maybe helping help earth to blow up an oil factory and cherub job is to stop the people to blowing up the oil factory. Corban, Jak, kyle
776 2018-08-30 22:29:36 Gdp growth is misleading as we have had a 3 year stack of poor performance so its easy to have a good year when you are comparing this year to the previous 3. Having said that our recent growth is being driven by higher oil prices, certainly not by NDP policies.
777 2018-08-30 22:29:32 "Under Mr. Chavez, poverty was reduced by 50%."
Those gains have more than reversed now. Nothing sustainable was built. Productive capacity actually fell. Entire industries were nationalized and then destroyed. Venezuela is swimming in oil yet production kept falling.
778 2018-08-30 22:29:22 I was going to tweet about how I hate the tine it takes oil paint to dry (it’s still my favorite medium to work with). I realize, though, oil painting is teaching me the importance of planning and patience. Thankful
779 2018-08-30 22:29:21 Totally! That's what I love about how it looks, a "what if," if they did this in S6? A whole original story could be made behind the consists James pulled of the oil tankers and some deleted footage for James' song for that season vs others ... learning the importance of freight.
780 2018-08-30 22:29:18 Gary would rather keep Canadians filling their cars with Saudi, Venezuelan, or Iranian oil perhaps? Because theirs is so much cleaner, ethical, and environmentally friendly? His statement there is a sad joke.
781 2018-08-30 22:29:16 He looks like he is on the verge of a break down. I wouldn't be surprised if his family is heavily invested in oil sands.
782 2018-08-30 22:29:11 Peppermint oil is one of the greatest things ever
783 2018-08-30 22:29:09 However, some of AB's carbon-tax revenue is being used to make the oil sands more energy efficient, less GHG emissions, etc.
784 2018-08-30 22:28:56 My husband uses the oil for chronic pain, he gets the flavored oil without THC! You just squirt it under your tongue and swallow
785 2018-08-30 22:28:53 Oh yes baby oil, we glistening
786 2018-08-30 22:28:51 ネロちゃん可愛い……
787 2018-08-30 22:28:46 Or baby oil
788 2018-08-30 22:28:40 Personally I don't even rely on using those sauces, if you've got the right ingredients you can make a great sauce, that or you can just toss in a bit of butter or oil, some pepper, salt, garlic, maybe a bit of oregano if you've got any, and it makes for a nice meal as well!
789 2018-08-30 22:28:38 So he threatened the Saudis with destroying the worlds most stable electric car manufacturer, at the same time their government is contemplating the giant desert they have to farm sunlight from while their oil reserves deplete? He's being relatively too smart, which is stupid..
790 2018-08-30 22:28:31 Andy please don’t be so humble. I for one thank you for all your hard work. With this pipeline now behind us we focus on the environment and the economic benefits of other countries as we accept their tanker oil on the east coast and jet fuel on the west coast

793 2018-08-30 22:27:46 my goal is "i don't want a dumb ass leaky tube spreading il through everything it touches." if they want to transport oil, why not do it in a way that doesn't leak a significant portion into the local soil.
794 2018-08-30 22:27:46 I hate mechanics. They be like, your car is in great condition! We changed your oil like you asked, you just need new brakes and rotors an alignment something about steering an air filter and spark plugs.. your total is 1.3 million let us know when you want us to do the work.
795 2018-08-30 22:27:18 Seriously - does it taste bad?  The stuff with olive oil is good.
796 2018-08-30 22:27:06 Dan, the climate deniers are doing the bidding of the oil companies. Their mis information campaign has been successful. No politician will lift a finger against them. Switch to other fuels. Don’t use oil based products. It going to be a long haul.
797 2018-08-30 22:26:52 Whuuut? Full of meat? The Mediterranean? It's almost like homo-sapiens live there! LOL. It's not just whole wheat bread, white beans, spinach and olive oil? 

If you want to see what some has said about a thing on twitter just search thier "@" and the word. 
798 2018-08-30 22:26:41 do you know how to change your oil in your car?

805 2018-08-30 22:26:02 Yeah because if we don't ship oil to China that means we can't use it either...

807 2018-08-30 22:25:56 it's a project to build a pipeline through roughly one thousand kilometers of (mostly natively owned) mountain land to pump bituminous oil (basically crude oil extracted from tar sands) to sell to the US and other markets. the federal courts struck down expansion plans today.

810 2018-08-30 22:25:42 I find it amazing that people associate energy as just oil. All oil is in one way or another an environmental nightmare. But, using the word energy implies, solar, electric, steam... etc etc. So no, it’s not even in the same realm. I’m for the pipeline btw but oil is not clean.

813 2018-08-30 22:25:14 Cat Update 2: Vet laughed when I showed her the #CBD oil I’d been using to treat pain and said she’s seen it a lot lately and has basically accepted it as part of holistic animal care these days. Not a shining recommendation but she didn’t seem to have any issue with it.
814 2018-08-30 22:25:08 @PeteDominick @jeremyslevin One way of distilling what's been going on: 1) stock the moat (20 yrs of gun proliferation); 2) raise the drawbridge (make upward mobility next to impossible via unfair tax cuts); 3) pour boiling oil on any who'd breach the ramparts (pack the courts).
815 2018-08-30 22:25:04 Be sure the birds enjoy their Labor Day picnic!  Ace 20# wild bird blend is 3 for $12 and Ace 20# black oil sunflower seed is 2 for $16 when you show this post through 9.03.18 at Purcell Oswego & Yorkville Ace.
816 2018-08-30 22:24:59 The business case for shipping oil east doesn’t work at current pricing. Better business sense to buy oil from international markets and sell Alberta oil.
817 2018-08-30 22:24:55 want to stop oil mining are terroising them with mini car bombs. But CHERUB thinks they might do something worse so they are trying to locate the suspects and see if they might be doing anything dangerous.

818 2018-08-30 22:24:51 It's certainly different. Very subtle. Every time you're thinking 'shouldn't that bake a little longer?' Or 'is that still raw?' Or 'isn't that a gross anount of olive oil?'
819 2018-08-30 22:24:44 I need a oil change and a haircut my life in shambles right now

822 2018-08-30 22:24:39 The police wanted to put an oil rink there and destroy the environment so the hippies wanted to blow it up. CHERUB was involved because they want to bring peace.

823 2018-08-30 22:24:39 Hi @AmyJaffeenergy, about that panel in Sacramento you reference, that we were both on.  I don't recall any discussion of a "total phase out".  Even the most ambitious proposal is akin to a decline in oil production that matches California's plans to reduce oil demand.
824 2018-08-30 22:24:19 The problem with fort harmony was a group of hippies were going to blow the oil meating.

833 2018-08-30 22:23:04 If ur chart is to be believed then Y not just follow API lead.  They were more accurate than TT.  One can use API predictions to go long or short oil.
834 2018-08-30 22:22:52 This looks great! So nice to see this and in fairly good condition. I love the tankers with the faces on, but on one of those cool S6 oil tankers? Yes please. 
835 2018-08-30 22:22:50 Does it involve excessive extraction of resources - oil, gas, mineral & timber? Wholesale sell off of public lands? Will there be a comment period?

842 2018-08-30 22:21:50 It kind of smacks of the Donald's EPA guy who lifted all the regulations on Big Coal & Big Oil. Wonder how much they contributed to the Trump campaign?????
843 2018-08-30 22:21:49 Fort Harmony is a big sight were hundreds of hippies live. A while ago the police wanted to move them out but the hippies refused. Ever since then the police have been desperate to get them out. CHERUB was involved because oil workers were having a big meeting and a company who
844 2018-08-30 22:21:48 Are there any other sources of energy that can claim those 3 things considering worker safety, company accountability, cost efficiency, spills? Have you done the research on this? And do you want all the oil trained or trucked thru hundreds of Canadian backyards?

847 2018-08-30 22:21:36 Bro your FBI & CIA sucks, they don't just topple government's for oil and riches, they deliberately turn a real decent humans into terrorists, just to prove there false Intel, like those Iraq WMDs, which were never there. But the whole country got destroyed !
848 2018-08-30 22:21:27 We have a 35% off Labor Day sale going on right now for our CBD oil! You won't have too much luck purchasing from Amazon, as CBD oil is banned on their site, so it would be very risky. Let me know if you have any CBD oil questions! 
849 2018-08-30 22:21:15 @TourismTT I hope that with oil business coming to a slow down in Trinidad that you will focus more on Tourism and your airport. workers at your airport are very unfriendly and rude. maybe if they are trained properly to deal with Strangers it would help your economy with tourist
850 2018-08-30 22:21:03 Let's talk about the all the oil spills that happen in the U.S. that are harming our environment, yet we don't hear about them in the news.

853 2018-08-30 22:20:43 You should be glad that an independent Federal Court upheld constitutionally-mandated process. Decision has nothing to do with oil & oilsands. It’s about the failure to consult the First Nations. And it is your Tories under Harper who failed to do that, not Trudeu.
854 2018-08-30 22:20:06 No, they don't people get rare cancers because the pollutants of these pipelines enter their water and air it's tragic. But the thing is this oil sands is a temporary business model ... Alberta is ruined b/c of it & BC (where this pipeline is) won't let that happen ...
855 2018-08-30 22:20:02 The problem was that Help Earth campaigners wanted to blow up and kill the oil company owners. Cherub had to stop the terrorists from blowing up the biulding.   Wiremu
856 2018-08-30 22:20:02 At what time on planet earth has the climate not been changing? Your views are short sighted and punishing hard working Canadians is not the solution. If you're protesting oil your carbon footprint better be 0, otherwise you're just another hypocrite like Mike.
857 2018-08-30 22:19:53 Well maybe First Nations should run things let’s see where and how Alberta would pay out First Nation good people. It’s not fair to take away our income. OIL!!!!!!OIL

859 2018-08-30 22:19:47 What is clean, ethical or environmental about oil? This is not naive or ignorant, it is dangerously delusional #CANpoli
860 2018-08-30 22:19:18 The @Origins packaging for Zero Oil face wash is terrible. First it completely blocked the hole so I can't even dispense the product. I unblocked it last night and now it's leaking because I guess that thing that blocked it was needed. So there's my $$ down the drain :(
861 2018-08-30 22:19:10 The problem was that the hippies were trying to stop the oil people fro working there. They think there is going to be a bombing by the hippies on the oil people. Reef

863 2018-08-30 22:19:04 They were going to have a big meeting and big oil rig companies were meeting so they thought that there might trouble so they sent agents into town to see if any anusal people came into town. -Jack and Zack
864 2018-08-30 22:19:03 I think the idea was that we start winding our dependence on oil down not up. Most people are talking about a transition.

867 2018-08-30 22:18:48 the problem with fort harmony was that there were people there from help earth who were going to blow up the oil company cherub were involved to stop this from haping. Cameron
868 2018-08-30 22:18:48 They didn't run out of oil reserves. They lost the ability to get enough of the stuff out of the ground. The nationalizations of foreign oil company assets and starving PDVSA of capital to fund social programs has left them with a severly dimished production capacity.

884 2018-08-30 22:17:01 You could consult until your lips fall off. There is a concentrated effort to suppress oil and gas in this country. It’s mind boggling. While other countries ramp up we have full reversed and currently falling backward off a cliff.

886 2018-08-30 22:16:57 It just means more oil trains through the Fraser Canyon...
887 2018-08-30 22:16:30 - we have the 3rd largest reserves in the world and could fill our own needs, and others.

-  we could NOT economically supply eastern Canada with the products required, other than crude. 

- oil pays your bills, whether you like it or not !!!

890 2018-08-30 22:16:18 So I watched Loving Vincent. It’s an interesting film, certainly genius in its central gimmick - a film made visual by over a hundred artists painting 65000+ individual frames in oil paints, it’s gorgeous and brilliant and flowing in all the ways you’d expect from such a premise,
891 2018-08-30 22:16:08 A system dependent on exponential growth and infinite resources like how the global capitalist system is currently running is going to eventually implode when it runs out of countries to exploit and debt to expand with. Oil is a finite resource and so is water...
892 2018-08-30 22:16:04 man, I don't know if I should try to force myself to stick to one medium or not
I always seem to want to try something else

sculpting, digital art, oil painting, now I've been super interested in 3d art for, like, a year

should I make myself stick to just one type of art?

894 2018-08-30 22:15:48 Well, we went out in the woods and collected some mushrooms the other night. Sauteed them up in olive oil, garlic and white wine. Then added cream and basil over pasta. I stopped hallucinating around 2 a.m. (the first part of the story is true and the last sentence isn't. )

900 2018-08-30 22:15:06 Time to turn off the taps, Rachel.  It might be time to revisit the whole revenue-sharing thing, too, Justin.

907 2018-08-30 22:14:15 Agreed. Among with halting equalization payments if they oppose the oil.
908 2018-08-30 22:14:01 Yes because importing foreign oil from the US, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and others is a far better solution, and definitely more environmentally friendly.  Why use the oil in our own backyard, and benefit Canada, when we can continue to send money out of our country.  #transmountain

946 2018-08-30 22:08:29 I don’t heat my house with oil and I walk to work. 

It’s funny that you think these concepts are some sort of evil voodoo magic
947 2018-08-30 22:08:24 Well, this is where it gets interesting, isn't it? 

Because most of those goods are renewable (except ore).  When we export oil or ore, we are exporting Canadian soil.  We are literally selling Canada out from under our feet.

So big question is: should we be selling ?

951 2018-08-30 22:08:01 I suggest doing them one at a time which people can handle, Cos. will feel it and know where it's coming from. It's hard to change your whole lifestyle all at once. I think we should target 1 oil company too-Exxon? Not that others aren't bad but we can affect 1 bottom line.
952 2018-08-30 22:07:32 The same guy who has no problem buying Saudi oil but sabotaged our own efforts to establish a stronger oil industry? Of course we trust him. 

We trust Trudeau to be a Trudeau.

959 2018-08-30 22:06:10 I am all for renewables. Until such time as we have a permanent and reliable source, we should continue to responsibly use our oil. We should be developing green energy at the same time. I find Jagmet  Singhs suggestion of purchasing foreign oil insane.
960 2018-08-30 22:05:57 @badkaratemovie @corbydavidson 

Really enjoyed your segment on car evolution. I’m thinking it will be delayed a decade or two due to the government putting up roadblocks due to Middle East oil allies and domestic job loss (need those votes.)
961 2018-08-30 22:05:39 The world will use oil, just not ours. How wise is that?
962 2018-08-30 22:05:29 i'm ambivalent on prosciutto but chickpeas + olive oil sounds DIVINE, thank you!!
963 2018-08-30 22:05:19 Al thats bull shit. The world will still continue on oil for 100 years and more. The question is shall it be oil from immoral sources like Russia or Saudi Arabia or from Canada? More money in the hands of vile, corrupt nations without human rights or enlightened Canadians?
964 2018-08-30 22:05:18 Roxy is so spoiled she gets rubbed down with coconut oil after her bath

967 2018-08-30 22:05:03 what do u even do when u strike oil. call 911?
968 2018-08-30 22:04:42 @Tzeporah What is your carbon footprint? You do not use fossil fuels for anything at all? Or just the stuff from countries that treat women, LGBTQ and the environment poorly? You and I both know we need oil until renewables are ready.
969 2018-08-30 22:04:38 Ever heard of oil independence T?
970 2018-08-30 22:04:18 Should be announcing the termination of the carbon tax until at least #Transmountain start moving oil!

973 2018-08-30 22:04:07 I think I was supposed to get an oil change in June..... here it is almost September
974 2018-08-30 22:04:06 @OUKosher does not certify Iberia Extra Virgin Olive Oil With Balsamic Vinegar.  Some bottles were labeled with an unauthorized OU symbol.  Corrective actions are being implemented.

978 2018-08-30 22:03:46 Last time I was there they served me a glass of motor oil which I think is why Firestone Auto thought they had gone to far. It’s all kind of Venn-Diagrammy at this point.
979 2018-08-30 22:03:43 So where do ypu all think the money will come from for all your infastructure project now.ostvofvthe moneys The gove is goving to provinces is coming from the oil patch. Also if we completly shut down all our oil it wont change anything in the world as fas as climate change goes
980 2018-08-30 22:03:40 Nothing makes this country more great than our diversity, not oil or geography, but the uniqueness of our tribes and the differences in our customs and traditions. This in itself is divisive yet if looked upon closely, promotes unity!

982 2018-08-30 22:03:16 They're sitting on a gold mine in oil and are starving their people with their socialist ideas.   They need Capitalism as much as they need food.
983 2018-08-30 22:03:09 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, I need a job, dude. Oil and gas industry is all I know. Drilling and Completion. I have been laid off for 600 days. Filled out over 200 on line applications with 2 reply of "your over qualified. I really don't know why I tweet this to you,
984 2018-08-30 22:02:56 hey, I know for a fact that they never freeze their chicken, even in transport. I used to be a cook for them. I know how long they marinate their chicken, how they hand bread it, and how they even set the chicken on the try to drain off the excess oil after pressure frying.
985 2018-08-30 22:02:46 Al Gore is all fake News! He  made millions of $ & got a noble prize& awards  based on preaching about pollution even though he has polluted  personally for years the  air  flying daily on his own private jet & selling his own TV channel to the Qatar, Huge oil producers .
986 2018-08-30 22:02:35 Alright we have three here lets get @bbki2611 that's the team. 2 FX Traders, 1 Rates Trader and one Oil Trader. What more can you ask for ?? :)
987 2018-08-30 22:02:20 I guess you are basically saying that importing Saudi oil into NS and Que refineries, as well as rest of world, is cleaner, more ethical and env friendly. Is that what u r saying?
988 2018-08-30 22:02:14 Does anyone else guess the weather outside by checking how much their coconut oil has liquified or hardened?  lol

"a dash of olive oil" (pours in half the bottle)
"Beautiful! Look at that color!"
"Add in some thyme to give it a good flavor!" (There's always thyme)
"And thats how you make good green tea."
990 2018-08-30 22:01:55 My heart hurts bc there’s huge oil rigs right off the shore from where we’re staying not only is it ugly af but all those poor lil sea creatures cannot b happy either
991 2018-08-30 22:01:48 Hit Montana??  That is in the US.  Canada already has a bunch of pipes going there with very cheap crude oil! Going through the US means they want a BIG cut which means AB is back to square one.  Nothing can change the reality on the ground.
992 2018-08-30 22:01:47 Dawg it was 100 degrees in Arkansas. Baby oil was not the wave 
993 2018-08-30 22:01:44 So....   Solar energy... wind energy... hydro energy...are all somehow "not as clean as oil?"  

Really? You sure about that?

996 2018-08-30 22:01:29 When cooked we brush olive oil on the crust. We use fast active for consistancy. This pizza is a personal size. We have larger pizzas in our local restaurants. Like all restaurants located in airports we don't run the day to day operations. Come visit!

999 2018-08-30 22:01:26 In general, sure, but bitumen is inherently less environmentally friendly than conventional oil. In that sense a lot of our oil is “worse” than oil from some other nations.
1000 2018-08-30 22:01:12 Getting an oil change  I need a husband 
1001 2018-08-30 22:00:57 Shout out to my moms doctor for recommending CBD oil. It took him 5 mins when its taken me 5 years to convince her 
1002 2018-08-30 22:00:56 Republicans don’t think government works. They gerrymander so POC can’t vote, roll back safety, oil, gas,& clean water regs, immigration laws, give tax breaks to 1%, shutdown/change polling stations, believe healthcare is only 4 them and make racists comments & grift.
1003 2018-08-30 22:00:55 This must be garlic: 3 tablespoons of minced and sautéed in olive oil?
1004 2018-08-30 22:00:55 Out of curiosity  ...
Who has used CBD Oil & what was your experience using it?
1005 2018-08-30 22:00:42 Oh oh think we will all be riding bicycles in BC once #alberta shuts off the oil supply!
1006 2018-08-30 22:00:38 So it’s clearly not a soulless club built on oil money. The money improved us and you’d kill for the same investment.

1013 2018-08-30 22:00:02 Yes Dan, let’s stick to the facts. 

Canada doesn’t produce the world’s “dirtiest” oil. Also, of the top 10 oil exporters who’s the leader in clean tech? Renewables? Social progress? Equality? Freedom? Environmental innovation? Canada on all accounts.

“Whatever” though...
1014 2018-08-30 21:59:46 Had to buy 4 tires and get a oil change
1015 2018-08-30 21:59:44 You just described oil as the "cleanest, most ethical" and "environmentally-friendly" energy in the world.  Remind us, what the rate on your last HYDRO bill?
1016 2018-08-30 21:59:36 The argument is still that pipeline transportation would drastically increase oil sales.
1017 2018-08-30 21:59:35 now I was reminded of it, y'all, if you're boycotting chik-fil-a: the tricks are pickle juice & peanut oil. The spice blend can be replicated to taste by blending the following into the flour: powdered sugar, paprika, salt, pepper, garlic powder, celery salt, & optional cayenne.
1018 2018-08-30 21:59:31 And, I agree with you on SA. I've never understood why we consider such an atrocious hot bed of human and women's rights abuses an ally. It's all about the oil.
1019 2018-08-30 21:59:22 I’m like a little bit, I thought maybe she was going to ask if I could check her oil or something
1020 2018-08-30 21:59:05 Which countries are “completely divesting themselves of oil”? I would like you to back that up with DATA not just a comment. Then one can research how they are doing it, the yearly climate, the size of the country, etc. etc.
1021 2018-08-30 21:59:02 Perhaps he will regift Texas back to Mexico.. along with all that oil, since he thinks non~whites born in Texas are not citizens 
1022 2018-08-30 21:58:59 Venezuela is the country with the biggest oil reserves on earth... HRW as always friendly helper to bring the American companies into possession of the oil
1023 2018-08-30 21:58:58 Oil & gas elites struggling here.

1032 2018-08-30 21:58:09 I totally understand girl! I started my day after I got gas my car stalled. Had to miss work cause I was on the phone with dealership. Then I drove up there, slowly. Told to come back tomorrow. So i don't know if it's an oil issue or something worse. And bills are due!
1033 2018-08-30 21:58:08 @IndyCar needs to go to Lucas oil raceway in the near future if an renovation of the whole complex is approved and completed it can be epic and it would be a guaranteed sell out
1034 2018-08-30 21:58:06 Hahaha oil money
1035 2018-08-30 21:58:04 TRANSLATION:  Today I spoke with Premier @RachelNotley - and reassured her that the federal government stands by the wasted $4.5B of tax payer $ for a leaky old pipeline and ignore Saudi Arabia oil to the East, and pay lip service to avoid losing votes before Oct. 2019.
1036 2018-08-30 21:58:03 He is happier than a pig in shit that this has been turned down thats what he wanted in first place keep oil in the ground the phony hypocrite will do and say anything for a vote
1037 2018-08-30 21:58:00 Yeah I left involuntarily... otherwise would still be there. That’s the Oil business tho.
1038 2018-08-30 21:57:58 So, I guess we are not going to get oil of the rails to make room for grain any time soon. #oilinpipesgrainontrains

1041 2018-08-30 21:57:43 Here’s a fun exercise. Get a whole bunch of brown rice. Squeeze it and tell me when you have extracted a teaspoon of oil!
1042 2018-08-30 21:57:43 @petenajarian  Hi Dr. J, What is happening to SLCA?  We were high on this stock at $25 and now $21?  If oil stays at $65 or higher, fracking is going to increase and SLCA has 50% market share.  What am I missing?
1043 2018-08-30 21:57:43 Not at all....that would be akin to following  tactics of all the foreign funded opposition groups who cite junk science to bash the oil sands!
1044 2018-08-30 21:57:38 Get a bunch of train cars. We still got oil to get to tidewater but now it’s gotta go in 40 foot sections on top of the earth & water & through the towns.
1045 2018-08-30 21:57:33 You need to join so you can shell out £120 a year on the promise of podcasts that don’t appear, and for diet advice you could get for free from google. Don’t be taken in by gaunt, classic snake oil salesman. Fat bastard promoting a diet? Don’t think so
1046 2018-08-30 21:57:26 Get a bunch of train cars. We still got oil to get to tidewater but now it’s gotta go in 40 foot sections on top of the earth & water & through the towns.
1047 2018-08-30 21:57:22 Drier year, thinner canopy’s, strong winds last fall, kinda the perfect storm. Along with poorly maintained side roads/ditches, power poles, oil leases. It’s spreading like wildfire #kochia18
1048 2018-08-30 21:57:19 What wars for oil :/
1049 2018-08-30 21:57:19 Told someone today they should buy local to circulate the oil dollar they were like ....... what oil???
1050 2018-08-30 21:57:18 And for your info, crude oil price in 1999 hovered between $9-15 per barrel and the PDP government still turned things around e.g paid debt. Intangible sectors(entertainment, making up, comedy etc)  of the economy became tangible. There was expansion of the middle class
1051 2018-08-30 21:57:15 We talked my f.i.l. into putting cannabis is oil on his skin cancer. Just starting. He is having "luck" with immunotherapy infusions though. I do not trust big pharma!
1052 2018-08-30 21:57:09 So we take Saudi oil. ..over water. 
And that's ok...!!!
1053 2018-08-30 21:57:07 He's a fuckin idio, he was just now telling the female park ranger how to put oil in the gator....
1054 2018-08-30 21:57:03 منورة بيك ..الله يسلمك
1055 2018-08-30 21:56:58 I drink coconut oil in my tea or coffee almost everyday and I still don't have luscious locks or perfect skin or an indestructible immune system. What am I doing wrong? Arent I supposed to be cured?
1056 2018-08-30 21:56:56 What is ur solution to move Alberta oil to new markets!?!?  Oh, I hear silence. Ur no leader let alone a PM.  Attack ads, mistruths & misrepresetations R what the cdn voters will see from u Cons. No ideas, just blather. Ur no PM.
1057 2018-08-30 21:56:35 Watch out for those Saudi, Venezuelan & American oil tankers !!!
1058 2018-08-30 21:56:20 Valvoline just charged me 85.00 for an oil change because it’s “full synthetic” they are about to have a “full” foot up their asses
1059 2018-08-30 21:56:12 Win Nov canola up A$4.47/t & EU rape up A$3.24. Helped by currency moves but also US soyoil up & palm oil up. Canola strength despite US soybns falling to contract closing low.
1060 2018-08-30 21:56:12 You know the BS they pushed down on the American public called the Affordable Care Act? It wasn’t so “affordable”! The cost of my insurance more than tripled! Sell your snake oil some where else! I don’t need people like your sorry ass telling me what doctor I can or can’t see!
1061 2018-08-30 21:56:05 Who sells the weed oil for the pens 
1062 2018-08-30 21:56:03 I have set aside some time in fasting and prayer for your deliverance. Come see me this Sunday I want to anoint your head with oil
1063 2018-08-30 21:55:56 More loans for Venezuela? They are already in default! The oil boom delivered a trillion dollars to Chavez during his rule, they have less than nothing to show for it all.
1064 2018-08-30 21:55:49 Had a nightmare that the lead singer of Midnight Oil owned & opersted a torture factory.
1065 2018-08-30 21:55:49 get my oil changed
1066 2018-08-30 21:55:40 @IMPACTWRESTLING @Tess_Blanchard what's your favorite kind of paintings acrylic watercolor or oil #TessaIsForever
1067 2018-08-30 21:55:36 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
1068 2018-08-30 21:55:28 It's actually #painfulL! Am constantly shoving fingers in my ears. #hearingloss is imminent. @TTChelps, pls oil the rails/wheels or whatever causes that horrible noise. #subway
1069 2018-08-30 21:55:27 Looking forward to your column. Absolutely discouraged. My message to my kids - don’t plan to stay in Canada. Future is bleak.
*** But am hoping one might write an essay about ‘what if’ Canada had no oil (or stopped developing it). Suspect similar to George Bailey’s revelation.
1070 2018-08-30 21:55:19 Just musing here but a weakened fiscal outlook because Cdn oil will continue to be sold at a discount will embolden the Americans to extract more concessions from Cdn negotiators.
1071 2018-08-30 21:55:17 Try CBD oil !! It’s been helping me a lot with my anxiety
1072 2018-08-30 21:55:17 Hot AU idea: 
Connor working on field for an animal rescue, doing shit like going out and helping animals during oil spills and what not 
And Hank who works in the animal rehabilitation center
1073 2018-08-30 21:55:11 If you think heavy crude from the oil sands is lily white you show you ignorance  of the crude and your essential stupidity. In trying to make some political hay you've pitched some inedible 
1074 2018-08-30 21:55:05 Arabian oil perfumes pls, tag someone that sells！
1075 2018-08-30 21:54:58 Wake up "bonespur" you are a fake a fraud, a snake oil salesman who belongs in the center ring of a circus ,not the peoples house
1076 2018-08-30 21:54:54 I worked in the car biz for a bit so I change my own oil, have changed countless tires etc. lol but they could at least TRY to help!
1077 2018-08-30 21:54:53 There's like 5 million kinds of seed oil, so I can't keep track. I looked up mustard oil the other day and it seems fine, similar to olive oil.
1078 2018-08-30 21:54:41 You know you can change your oil yourself and not have to pay the dealer. Make him do it lol
1079 2018-08-30 21:54:34 one of my favorite things in the whole universe is seeing a naked woman lathered in oil
1080 2018-08-30 21:54:29 Weird day... I've had no email correspondence due to @EPB_Chattanooga network problems. If I had some oil to put in the lantern, and I could saddle up ol' Bessie, it would be like life in the 1800s.
1081 2018-08-30 21:54:25 Have you seen temp workers working as indentured labourers in Saudi Arabia? I don’t think so. Yes Canadian oil is most ethical.
1082 2018-08-30 21:54:13 Big oil and it’s “lackeys” we’re never the “little guy”
1083 2018-08-30 21:54:11 Iran's most senior general has threatened to shut down the world's busiest oil chokepoint if the U.S. manages to completely cut his country's oil and gas trade.. #HypocrisyOnTheHoof 
Major General Mohammad Hossein Bagheri, the head of the Iranian military's chief
1084 2018-08-30 21:54:06 every straight man on a baking show: this is a maple bacon coffee cake with a bacon bourbon motor oil buttercream
1085 2018-08-30 21:53:44 We wouldn’t want to risk polluting the plant. Much safer to let the Saudis ship the oil across 10,000 km of ocean. Wait...what?
1086 2018-08-30 21:53:43 I'm sure that's just basil and olive oil.

1088 2018-08-30 21:53:41 In today's society the dudes probably had no idea either. I'm always amazed at how many of even my male friends don't know how to change their brakes or their oil.
1089 2018-08-30 21:53:31 Nah. I have your flip flops, topical oil, and crystals in my lost and found cubby. The only think that's not yours is a zine about 1980's leather and bondage paraphernalia. So.. if you want to listen to Cher and look at the zine then I think we have a winner. #WITCHESofOAK
1090 2018-08-30 21:53:26 WTI Crude Oil +1.0% to 70.22 bbl  $USO
Gold -0.5% to 1204.90 oz  $GLD
Copper -0.7% to 2.69 lb  $CU
1091 2018-08-30 21:53:23 So people who have lost their homes to forest fires or lost their lives because of the extreme heat/cause they cannot afford AC because of climate change aren’t the “little guy”? Are the animals who’s habitats have been destroyed bc climate change/oil spills not the “little guy”
1092 2018-08-30 21:53:23 No you showed your true colors and that’s fine with me I know what I am. Personally I didn’t vote for either one of them! I just despise that all media is controlled by their advertisers Lockheed Martin big oil etc. who have their own agendas which makes most all MSM propaganda
1093 2018-08-30 21:53:19 But oil was 120$ and 90% of Vnzl economy os oil. With oil 30$...
1094 2018-08-30 21:53:00 Took my car to get an oil change and they called at 5:48 and said it was ready but I have to be there before 6....good luck to me
1095 2018-08-30 21:52:58 Why you think Saudi oil is more ethical?
1096 2018-08-30 21:52:58 your bike.......what kind of chain oil does it use? during its manufacturing do you think there might have been some oil used?
1097 2018-08-30 21:52:52 Let me guess, since there isn’t an abundant source of untapped oil there you don’t think SA needs some freedom?
1098 2018-08-30 21:52:52 Let us not forget- when the government broke up Standard Oil and forced them into several smaller companies it made John Rockefeller the richest man in history
1099 2018-08-30 21:52:51 The problem with NRM is they don't want anyone to challenge their grip on power.

And they'll guard "their oil" at all costs...
1100 2018-08-30 21:52:46 It's the ignorance of its citizens. Ignorance sometimes does not necessarily mean that you may not know anything ignorance also means that you can know the wrong the thing. Mr ignoramus, low oil price is not the reason why Buhari is not performing...
1101 2018-08-30 21:52:33 Never to touch oil paint again!
1102 2018-08-30 21:52:05 That global warming snake oil salesman has no moral standing to demand anything of President Trump.
1103 2018-08-30 21:52:04 You’ve literally shit all over the ocean and tried to blame Oil. How’s the salmon and orca doing? You guys should be embarrassed
1104 2018-08-30 21:52:03 That's fine, we would rather have clean marajuana revenue than dirty oil money.
1105 2018-08-30 21:51:47 Is there a way to get a candle based on your partner’s scent? @CrystalGiraldo can we look into this? An essential oil perhaps? #daydreamer
1106 2018-08-30 21:51:46 Actually it does the opposite, no?
The NEB approved the pipeline, properly, to Vancouver.
Exporting the oil, with tankers, would have required a brand new approval process. Blaming the NEB for not regulating marine traffic is ludicrous
1107 2018-08-30 21:51:30 Sure liquid hydrogen just like home heating oil- safe dependable
1108 2018-08-30 21:51:26 I bet theresa mays body creaks during sex she needs oil in dem joints
1109 2018-08-30 21:51:09 He didn't say that about oil in general, but Aberta oil.  What he said is true.
1110 2018-08-30 21:51:07 Hey now. Another use for Olive Oil. Lol
1111 2018-08-30 21:50:56 That was started by big donors like the Koch bros and others, they just don't want to pay taxes or have regulations big oil coal.  I have watched them for years.  We can lay this whole thing right back in their lap.  Greedy family and others.
1112 2018-08-30 21:50:32 @algore  what have you done about Occidental Petroleum you're Board member all North Atlantic Right Whales from Seismic Airgun Blasting Chile/Peru oil removal via sand dragging? California why haven't you challeged Gov @JerryBrownGov allowing fracking, cars never smog check @KQE
1113 2018-08-30 21:50:30 Why does an oil change cost so much???
1114 2018-08-30 21:50:03 Treating your family well, being a good person and oil. The three staples of an ethical person.
1115 2018-08-30 21:49:54 Whilst I agree with healthy, natural fats & advocate a good mix of different fats, we need to be aware that, like Big Food & Big Pharma, there is a considerable PR influence paid for by Big Olive Oil (yes I said it) and not buy into every bit of positive research re olive oil
1116 2018-08-30 21:49:48 But they can't win, they don't have the financial capability to wrestle the oil bloc powers
1117 2018-08-30 21:49:37 Current pipeline does not have the capacity to reach all markets. Expansion enables us to increase our presence in the global market. The world wants cleaner oil, but we we are not getting enough of ours out there, which means they rely on other producers for steady supply.
1118 2018-08-30 21:49:29 Pipelines don’t pollute, people do! And if oil is sold to China,then owness is on them but no pipeline, so what oil?
1119 2018-08-30 21:49:26 You endorsed the candidate that will lose. Drew Edmondson will be Oklahoma’s next governor. The future of our schools and healthcare are at stake. No more Republican misusing funds and in the oil companies pockets.
1120 2018-08-30 21:49:17 Non-accredited aren’t allowed to directly invest in securities such as oil wells, even with REG CF. We’ve made a lot of progress, but there’s still a lot to improve on and open up these asset classes.

1125 2018-08-30 21:48:58 Democratisation came in the 1970s _as a result of the decomposition of the Bloc_ after the British were defeated in Yemen, after the oil crisis & after the US was defeated Vietnam etc. Etc.
1126 2018-08-30 21:48:57 Nope. Canada is just closed to dinosaur projects that will increase climate change , bring few new percent oil, and export a raw resource to be processed elsewhere.
1127 2018-08-30 21:48:51 I'm interested in the oil for pets too.  I just can find anybody to give a good review on it
1128 2018-08-30 21:48:42 Nigga that’s baby oil stop it
1129 2018-08-30 21:48:38 So like, starting off soft with some Bank heists and then moving on to more difficult jobs like Meltdown, Big Oil, Hotline Miami etc.?
1130 2018-08-30 21:48:35 No revenue from oil sands means sinking economy with less money for govy employees and reservation money for first nations

1132 2018-08-30 21:48:19 thats me !!! real job and an oil change
1133 2018-08-30 21:48:03 @badkaratemovie Oil in America will be different for gas demand. But how do we get our electricity to create batteries? Natural gas. Demand more than expected to double and triple over next 30 years. Price drop not happening like people think.
1134 2018-08-30 21:47:49 If Canadians don’t want dirty oil from alberta they don’t need the money either, change equalization calculations and exclude oil and gas.   Fair
1135 2018-08-30 21:47:47 So I have been diagnosed with severe depression and generalized anxiety disorder. I haven’t been on medication in almost 5 years. I’ve been think about seeking treatment but I don’t have health insurance. Heard a lot about using CBD oil. Have any of you tried this? Thoughts?
1136 2018-08-30 21:47:46 Soak hands in warm olive oil once a week for strong nails and youthful looking hands.
1137 2018-08-30 21:47:43 Celebration? 

Really? 

What about the hundreds, maybe thousands of Indigenous students, in school studying for a job in the oil industry. 

What are they thinking tonight?

1146 2018-08-30 21:46:30 I believe Standard Oil was one of them.
1147 2018-08-30 21:46:25 Right,it Vanished, oil does that all the time.

1156 2018-08-30 21:45:26 Saudi oil imports and all imports have declined or remained flat.

But if you feel so strongly go protest the refiners that buy Saudi oil instead of Nfld oil.
1157 2018-08-30 21:45:24 Pour oil on the ledge.
1158 2018-08-30 21:45:15 Oil & Gas industry pundit argues that not being able to build a pipeline means that we can’t build anything in Canada.

Behold the self centred arrogance of the Oil & Gas, burn the planet sect.

1159 2018-08-30 21:45:07 I refuse to pop these pimples. 

I'll let the Eucalyptus & Argan oil talk.
1160 2018-08-30 21:45:06 @GMC your oil change email offers are a scam! Never received rebate or gas card promised. And I should buy from you again?
1161 2018-08-30 21:45:00 oops I actually didn't catch that the first read. You are correct, he used the word Energy instead of Oil and Gas. Anyhow, our Oil and Gas industry is second to none (well, close to the top anyway). Ethically and Environmentally speaking.
1162 2018-08-30 21:44:58 #StopKM #pipeline Oil could have been replaced by wind and solar 10 times over since we started talking about this pipeline. Canada #dithers while #Canada burns. One way to go and that's green. Stop stalling just to profit Big Oil.
1163 2018-08-30 21:44:53 Ooo. Sign me up. I know more people who believe in ghosts than don't so it drives me up a wall when not one person goes "well, crap. Anybody got some sage and some lilac oil?"
1164 2018-08-30 21:44:38 This CBD oil stuff has helped with my dogs seperation anxiety soooo much. I'm such a happy dog mom after seeing the results 
1165 2018-08-30 21:44:26 "cleanest, most ethical" means he's comparing it to other sources of oil
like, you know, the kind of oil we buy from people who blow up buses full of school children

1167 2018-08-30 21:44:10 I would say go to Michael's and get their artist loft art supplies! They're $5 and they have sketchbooks, oil paints, packs of pencils, ect. It's perfect for you to use to practice before you move on to more expensive things
1168 2018-08-30 21:43:55 I’m sure. As smooth as a pipeline to carry oil. Trudeau has broken this country and the he’s not done yet.
1169 2018-08-30 21:43:53 Iran  oil shipments are already declining at a faster-than-expected pace ahead of U.S Sanctions
1170 2018-08-30 21:43:48 Or how about the first thing we secured was the oil ministry, while we let the Iraq Museum, one of the most historically relevant museums in the world, get ransacked.
1171 2018-08-30 21:43:44 That's just one of the many reasons why it's notoriously difficult to estimate the oil prices.

Normally, OPEC would've cut oil production, which would've increased the oil prices.
1172 2018-08-30 21:43:42 And how much has your snake oil salesman of a chairman actually spent
1173 2018-08-30 21:43:20 It’s so annoying when Cooking oil turns to cooking fat! Has your experience been like mine and what’s next
1174 2018-08-30 21:43:18 What's most frustrating about this, for me, is in Canada we produce our oil extremely responsibly. You don't get that anywhere else in the world and nobody in Canada who blockades our own production protests the actual problem producers. Because they're paid not to.
1175 2018-08-30 21:43:10 And yet we welcome SA oil....
1176 2018-08-30 21:43:07 So oil price IS $37, today. When will you people start living in the present?
1177 2018-08-30 21:43:06 Rumour has it the @EdmontonOilers sent out an email to season ticket holders to pick the goal song?? If this is true, there is is only one correct answer: Lovin’ Every Minute of It by Loverboy. Make it happen Oil Country.
1178 2018-08-30 21:43:03 Did you know what they call oil traders is like Scotia Bank selling to Scotia Bank as an example?  it s  true   . It is what they don t want us to know.
1179 2018-08-30 21:42:48 If Canadians don’t want dirty oil then they should exclude oil from equalization calculations.  Let alberta get rich from there resources instead of the money going to other provinces that are against the oil and gas industry.  Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.
1180 2018-08-30 21:42:41 I have been a client of Cronos (PN) for 3 years. In that time there has been 1 recall and it was voluntary. They called me and asked me if I wanted to keep it or send it back. I kept it. I use their CBD oil everyday. I have trouble getting product, often sold out.

1184 2018-08-30 21:42:02 I had what seemed like a bad allergic reaction to a face exfoliator last week and my face was overly dry. Used  combination of Vitamin E oil, Argan oil, and Vaseline and it got significantly better.

1191 2018-08-30 21:41:41 Are you really that obtuse?  Why were we paying so much for gas under the Liberals when world oil prices were 25% lower than they are now?
1192 2018-08-30 21:41:37 What is wrong with fuel cell power. I believe that the patents for these were bought by oil company’s many years ago to stop their development, but they seem to me to be a far superior power source than electric, and capable of powering all vehicles
1193 2018-08-30 21:41:36 Note the use of the word “energy” as opposed to “oil”. #notbyaccident
1194 2018-08-30 21:41:35 As I said, OPEC uncharacteristically didn't cut oil production in response to an oversupply of markets hence price collapsed. They did that to try and bankrupt shale oil producers in USA to reclaim their market share. Salmond. OECD et al had no inside knowledge of OPEC's plans.
1195 2018-08-30 21:41:34 You sure you're not referring to California? Except substitute  #ICE for Canadian Oil and #Antifa for Jobless socialist "protesters".  
Otherwise we sound like twins...Kinda sucks being us doesn't it? 
Not kidding either sad to say...
1196 2018-08-30 21:41:31 They stop the oil, they will get invaded. Military industrial complex itching for a bigger war.
1197 2018-08-30 21:41:30 I saw a video titled “coconut oil is pure poison” 
1198 2018-08-30 21:41:28 Just realized that the blood Daniel Plainview draws from the head of Eli at the end of There Will Be Blood represents the gushing oil he had drawn from the land his whole life. Now that the ending of that movie makes more sense, I love it even more. Best post-2000s movie IMHO
1199 2018-08-30 21:41:13 no more new oil infrastructure. use the old, fix the old so it can serve while we transition, and move on to something else. No one should be thinking about still using oil in 30 years.

1207 2018-08-30 21:40:48 is this a joke? calling AB oil the "cleanest, most ethical, environmentally-friendly energy in the world"? are you high?
1208 2018-08-30 21:40:46 America has poked it's huge nose in the middle East because of oil. For all the attacks every regime democrat or republican are guilty for the unrest in the middle East and North Africa. That's why they killed Hussein and Gadaffi. Just to destroy their countries for USA benefit.

1216 2018-08-30 21:40:12 人に会うたびに膨らんだって言われるけど、明日氷河期が来たら生き残るのは僕だよ。
1217 2018-08-30 21:40:07 Tyranny of the minority  (10% generous)  #kindermorgan is just that 10% of people who like to whine abt pipelines would rather see the oil transported by rail which is 10X more dangerous as it will get to tide water one way or other #cdnpoli @pnpcbc @vassykapelos #factsmatter
1218 2018-08-30 21:40:03 Anything short of a total suspension of all oil related products and all power that is sent to BC along with any future transfer payments to be stopped immediately, if not please resign or call an election on your lack of response
1219 2018-08-30 21:39:55 Also, erdogan directly and indirectly supported #daesh - and his family profited from illegal trade as well. 

Remember when USSOF killed the #daesh 'oil minister' and took his wife and records? Those records show trade with assad, turkey, iraq, pesh.

Bunch of corrupt whores.
1220 2018-08-30 21:39:51 Doing a lot of stuff to my car new speakers, breaks, new oil would you guys want me to record that?  @RelayRetweets @Retweet_Lobby
1221 2018-08-30 21:39:50 Kit kats contain palm oil BOYCOTT!
1222 2018-08-30 21:39:45 Right...got my one-hitter in my hand right now!  They should lace his cheeseburgers with CBD oil maybe that'll calm him down bunch of morons!
1223 2018-08-30 21:39:40 Olive oil is better than Paula’s Choice. Oh, and an alkaline vegan diet.
1224 2018-08-30 21:39:35 If Oil is not important to Canadians we should exclude it from equalization calculations
1225 2018-08-30 21:39:32 shit & oil
1226 2018-08-30 21:39:31 Ooh, now I know the nice way to say “snake oil salesman.”
1227 2018-08-30 21:39:30 Can't live the dream here, unless lucky enough to get into high paying oil/gas industry. Houston is not diverse in job industry's. Healthcare is specialized. Need more industry's, like Dallas and Austin. Mayor has failed to attract other industry's.
1228 2018-08-30 21:39:20 Once I was in a class with a guy who said you could cure tooth problems with clove oil, I haven’t tried this, though. Eighty percent of the people I have on Facebook are trying to sell me shampoo, I think, but I haven’t tried that either.
1229 2018-08-30 21:39:17 can i use olbas oil thats 20 years out of date
1230 2018-08-30 21:39:15 I use CBD oil, but there are a variety of strains that help different things. Yes you are right with the cost of scripts it can get expensive. I shop around to find good deals.
1231 2018-08-30 21:39:07 A lot of the KLM negotiations took place in Calgary oil company board rooms. They wrote the legistlation, enviro impact etc. Rigged. BC Legislature stayed closed almost one year while they did govt biz in Calgary. Rigged. #pnpcbc
1232 2018-08-30 21:39:06 Why wouldn’t you shift Alberta to a hydrogen economy? Why wouldnt you use magnetic repulsion generators to aid in electrolysis and desalination? Why are you so committed to dirty oil? You have a chance to create, don’t miss this opportunity @JustinTrudeau
1233 2018-08-30 21:39:04 Time to get ahead of the liberals and say you’ll drop SM but in good faith there are concessions we need. Better oil export and softwood lumber. Let’s go Andrew. Win your base back #NAFTA

1235 2018-08-30 21:38:57 I honestly don’t believe a great number of the people that oppose oil production know this
1236 2018-08-30 21:38:56 Treasured Earth Magnesium Oil and products for health will be trading at Casuarina Square’s one day shopping festival this Saturday. 

Darwin Kids Market will be operating in the quarter and will be trading from 9am - 4pm
1237 2018-08-30 21:38:55 I def still use them country crock bowls for old oil tho 
1238 2018-08-30 21:38:49 Are they using placebo oil in the trials? Just curious.
1239 2018-08-30 21:38:48 try olive oil xoxo
1240 2018-08-30 21:38:41 I mean... I like oil
1241 2018-08-30 21:38:36 Kinder Morgan picked up and ran because they saw that they wouldn’t be able pawn off the real cost of carbon fuel on Canadian taxpayers.

The oil & gas industry wants to take a shit in the environment, and have taxpayers come running with bum wipe.

#cdnpoli #abpoli
1242 2018-08-30 21:38:30 We as Americans don't have any reason to be in Syria.
but  oil, gas, & weapons industries, do have interests.
That's why Obama 
Invaded Syria with ISIS, & Al Qaeda to remove Assad. Thanks to Russia the jihadists are almost gone
but The US is still helping Al Qaeda.
1243 2018-08-30 21:38:30 Only the snake oil salesman can SHOUT NONSENSE AT people that use the same model of car as me!
1244 2018-08-30 21:38:26 She’s so stiff.  Someone give her cod liver oil or something... someone do something 
1245 2018-08-30 21:37:59 Spending 60+ on a stupid oil change was not on my agenda for the day
1246 2018-08-30 21:37:36 Third season, they come work with me and all the ex cons on the oil rigs.
1247 2018-08-30 21:37:33 @realDonaldTrump America must work to secure Iraqi oil, and must spend on US forces in Iraq and Syria from oil money would be better than Iran's confiscation of Iraqi money
1248 2018-08-30 21:37:18 I would dip my hands in oil and offer to help.
1249 2018-08-30 21:37:14 Tell that to Germany where 27% of energy needs from renewables. You might get a few more years of oil as energy, but the prognosis is “terminal”!
1250 2018-08-30 21:37:11 @POTUS America must work to secure Iraqi oil, and must spend on US forces in Iraq and Syria from oil money would be better than Iran's confiscation of Iraqi money
1251 2018-08-30 21:37:11 You realize Canadian economy still needs oil for a while but this does not mean that we still can’t start going green. We are shipping our oil to the US at half the price - this does not help anyone but the US!
1252 2018-08-30 21:37:01 Well, invest in the oil and gas industry anyway. I’m sure  investments in other industries will continue.
1253 2018-08-30 21:36:55 That’s great news Tokes! Let me know if she’d be down to use some cannabis oil for additional treatment. It’s something I happen to know a lot about.
1254 2018-08-30 21:36:53 No matter how many times politicians say a pipeline is in the national Canadian interest, it doesn't make it true.

National interest is for ALL Canadians, not those select few in the oil industry.   #pnpcbc #cdnpoli #TransMountain #bcpoli #KinderMorgan
1255 2018-08-30 21:36:52 I just bought a cool new conch seashell!  No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
1256 2018-08-30 21:36:49 I'm laughing at this conservative idiot sheer calling oil clean and ethical
1257 2018-08-30 21:36:48 All the other parties are mad about this... Federal NDP don't want it build, Conservatives use it as a big bad stupid government "just not ready" callback, and the Greens well, don't need an explanation.

Only people for it are certain oil employees and the Alberta NDP.
1258 2018-08-30 21:36:47 PSA: E. coli has been linked to multiple deaths and illnesses in 2018. It is strongly recommended that consumers deep fry ALL produce before consuming. Submersion in near-boiling canola oil for at least 45 seconds is the only sure way to kill the bacteria.
1259 2018-08-30 21:36:45 @AmbJohnBolton America must work to secure Iraqi oil, and must spend on US forces in Iraq and Syria from oil money would be better than Iran's confiscation of Iraqi money
1260 2018-08-30 21:36:37 I finally found sesame oil at the grocery store ugh my mind
1261 2018-08-30 21:36:35 Did you know that many investments firm got burned with oil investments and lost mega thousands $$  and those firms do not invest in oil stocks anymore.  We should all learn from them .
1262 2018-08-30 21:36:31 @SecPompeo America must work to secure Iraqi oil, and must spend on US forces in Iraq and Syria from oil money would be better than Iran's confiscation of Iraqi money

1267 2018-08-30 21:35:53 Cornbread has buttermilk, cornmeal and oil.  Your Frankenstein abomination is not cornbread and has made my ancestors roll over in their respective graves.
1268 2018-08-30 21:35:44 #TheWorldWouldBeBetterIf borders weren't decided arbitrarily....by, you know, where the oil and or water is...
1269 2018-08-30 21:35:38 Oil isn’t going anywhere. The notion that we will turn Canada’s economy green overnight is not happening. Now we can make progress to diversify Alberta’s economy, it still provides 8% of our total GDP. Crashing it would scare off outside investment and crash other markets
1270 2018-08-30 21:35:24 Ah! I see! We don't have that on our cbd oil oral sprays, but I definately got the easy open asprin at home.
1271 2018-08-30 21:35:10 We should be following the Saudi game plan! Make as much money of oil as possible, then diversify and invest to into green energy but all of these "I am going to save the Planet idiots" would rather watch Canada's economy struggle.
1272 2018-08-30 21:35:09 Mayonnaise is FUCKING DISGUSTING!!!

The ingredients are literally eggs, oil and FRICTION.
1273 2018-08-30 21:35:09 Crude oil prices climbed to the highest levels in weeks rose 1.1% to $70.25 a barrel on the NY Mercantile Exchange
1274 2018-08-30 21:35:05 But you were fine letting George W Bush get us into two wars over oil that we are still fighting today.

Hmmmm.......follow the money.
1275 2018-08-30 21:34:56 Yup! Bottom line is Trudeau does not want any pipelines and would phase out oil and gas. He's said so at G20.
1276 2018-08-30 21:34:36 I was walking down the stairs and realised that there's a group of people out there that are rich enough to buy expensive olive oil
1277 2018-08-30 21:34:33 When juju dey find blood, if you give am palm oil, e no go take. @dorcasDugan
1278 2018-08-30 21:34:33 Er, the Waste Paper did get predictions of oil prices badly wrong. SNP has never recovered from that.
1279 2018-08-30 21:34:25 Too bad ppl associate a provincial govt to the completely flawed NEB process originally scoped in 2013, & the feds lack of proper indigenous consultation. Not unlike blaming NDP 4 global oil price & inheriting a recession. May justice always override interim elected officials! 
1280 2018-08-30 21:34:23 Oil isn't the most environmentally friendly form of energy, no matter where it comes from. 

Our oil may be better sourced than others, but that doesn't make Scheer's statement any less ridiculous.
1281 2018-08-30 21:34:21 I seriously cannot wait. I live the peptide4 night oil so much. Any hints what could be in tsv??
1282 2018-08-30 21:34:17 Anyone else not know that oil spill cleanups only effectively remove 10-20% of the oil from the environment!? #absurd #OilLeaksSpills #ClimateChangeIsReal 
1283 2018-08-30 21:34:14 Cheese on toast!
1284 2018-08-30 21:34:13 If oil is not important to Canadians we should exclude if the the equalization calculations.

Monsanto purchased like 700 strains of cannabis. They GMOed wheat and oats to give people cancer. They own Pfizer who sells cancer treatment drugs. 
Rick Simpson Oil is made from a lb of cannabis. It cures cancer. 
1/4
1286 2018-08-30 21:33:58 Kettle chips are delicious, for the record. Salt and Fresh Ground Pepper is the best. I don't care about the non GMO or the oil they cook them in. They just taste good.
1287 2018-08-30 21:33:52 You a whole different breed my killa,  I mean like how you have 12,000 plus miles and never had an oil change Fmao I was so mad with 2 flat tires on the opposite ends, but she was fine so I had too get a little dirty for her Fmao
1288 2018-08-30 21:33:49 I just capital C CLEANSED my make up brushes with olive oil and dish soap...catharsis
1289 2018-08-30 21:33:48 @NoraDehard so just out of curiosity I know oil can sometimes get a little pricey but was this pretty kitty for personal keepsake or request? It said amateur but some of this looks pretty professional. I missed a red tail p-51 picture at our local fair this year ;(
1290 2018-08-30 21:33:47 What is going to happen in 15 years when the tanks get rust and leak oil ?
1291 2018-08-30 21:33:23 It's a desperate attempt to bait investors. Investment is up overall in Canada, but is fleeing the sands - not because of lack of pipelines, but because of the low price of oil and the high cost of extraction in the sands.  Lots of pressure from lobbyists.  Political threats etc
1292 2018-08-30 21:33:11 Do you prefer oil from Saudi Arabia Gary?
1293 2018-08-30 21:33:08 Starting to see all them politicians who wash 1.2 billion us from Venezuela oil company are getting held and investigated  now the main thing to do is snipe the main man
1294 2018-08-30 21:33:06 Fentanyl,not fentanol; generally when something ends with an -ol it denotes an alcohol(which includes the oil soluble alcohol,tetrahydrocannabinol) alcohols are a large chemical family
1295 2018-08-30 21:33:06 The difficulty is that no pipelines doesn't mean oil won't be shipped. It will just continue to go by rail car, which has proven to be more dangerous. It's sort of a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation, but for the time being, oil with continue to travel.
1296 2018-08-30 21:32:58 I’ve really become that bitch that has an essential oil diffuser and takes vitamins
1297 2018-08-30 21:32:56 If oil is not that important to Canadians we should take it out of the equalization calculations.

1301 2018-08-30 21:32:20 I started at Healesville it was my first track to work on, back in the day when it was grass track and non tab. Oil drum as a fire lure on other side. It has come so far but due to heritage reasons the tree had to stay, every time we did the track it was rejected to get removed
1302 2018-08-30 21:32:15 I let my step mom borrow my car because hers is in the shop and she filled my tank and took my car for an oil change 
1303 2018-08-30 21:32:08 Are you implying crude from the oil sands is somehow worse for the environment than oil produced elsewhere? New production has the same average ghg emissions as US oil production...

1330 2018-08-30 21:30:13 As an oil nation it is important that we diversify, esp given the NAFTA mess going on this week. Happy for the indigenous people but also sad for the tremendous loss to our economy and jobs in the energy sector.

1334 2018-08-30 21:29:37 I’m glad that you and I wholeheartedly agree that pipelines are far superior to oil by rail. 

We should also agree that TMP operated flawlessly for over 50 yrs. The one leak it had was caused by a City of Burnaby backhoe. But as you say, humans fail.
1335 2018-08-30 21:29:32 This is just a meme. A manmade meme. A meme made by someone with a personal agenda. ALL the people I know who are employed in the oil and gas industry make much MUCH more money than anyone else I know. Regardless of their position.
1336 2018-08-30 21:29:27 Uber is the ultimate in Capitalism. Socialism is NOT “sharing resources”. It is government ownership of industries not individuals or Corporations.

1339 2018-08-30 21:29:15 Listen to this ... so we go in for a oil change and I fell asleep in the corner and woke up an hour later and realized THEY LEFT MY ASS. Because they “couldn’t find me”

1344 2018-08-30 21:28:55 It's bcuz Trump is on automatic pilot.  No one can stop him.  He's got a mental problem & he can't control his urges to touch women, lie, cheat, steal from others (just take the oil).
1345 2018-08-30 21:28:44 No, the Anti Christ is more than likely a computer, like the internet, which,  in a similar way to God, is “Worshipped” worldwide. Drumpf is just a two bit con man, almost out of snake oil, and whose customers are broke and terribly disillusioned. He’s of no consequence anymore.
1346 2018-08-30 21:28:41 Those friends are funded by special interests and won’t talk. They have an agenda. It’s disgusting Canada can’t get anything done. It’s unfathomable that folks agree with importing dictator oil over our own resources
1347 2018-08-30 21:28:25 Using own beats having to import it. Look around your home. Oil and its derivatives are everywhere but somehow our future will exclude them? I love riding horses but much slower and less comfortable than a car. Have to throw away your mobile. No more lattes.
1348 2018-08-30 21:28:21 No.  They have no intention of doing so.  Would love to know who the large and small donors to the Trudeau foundation are to find out how much middle east oil money is flowing in there...
1349 2018-08-30 21:28:19 U are comparing apples to oranges... Bankers are people employed to work in the bank, same with oil workers but for over a decade, developers worked in banks and oil companies

1353 2018-08-30 21:27:57 My daughter uses pot for PTSD and anxiety too her doctor told her to get hold of some pot and smoke it when an attack is just starting it works great for her.  Also we want to check out CBD oil heard it works great for pain and anxiety without getting that high feeling.
1354 2018-08-30 21:27:55 So while I feel like shit I made myself get an oil change, put gas in, and finally renew my tags. Can I just nap the rest of the day even tho I took already took a 4 hr nap?
1355 2018-08-30 21:27:47 It’s OTT to say the whole system is corrupt.

Oil accumulating in a turbocharger, and then catching fire. That’s not corruption. 

Engg setting 7 handbrakes while air brakes on. That’s not corruption.

What happened is tragic, but these were human errors.

1360 2018-08-30 21:27:17 no, mr. nenshi, the westcoast ecosystem is of more importance to canada than the pipeline.
there are other ways to ship our oil (i have lived in alberta for 41 years of my 75))

1363 2018-08-30 21:27:02 Just now learning that Tea Tree oil is, in fact, kind of bullshit, and in a lot of people it makes skin problems get *worse*, not better. Wish I'd known before I started using it, ugh.
1364 2018-08-30 21:26:54 If electric cars are more earth safe, explain to me what energy is used when we plug them in. Is that not more harmful in the long run than oil?

1366 2018-08-30 21:26:52 Here's one I recall that isn't obvious, but is probably important. The bonding requirements for oil and gas drillers was set in the Kennedy administration and ever updated. It's about $10,000 as I recall. Such a low # is a blatant subsidy that affects industry structure.

1381 2018-08-30 21:25:13 True pipelines were built but none to tidewater which is the key issue here. The pipelines under Harper just went to the US and were still subject to a lower oil price than the international price. So I think the article in the Herald does not address all the facts.

1393 2018-08-30 21:24:03 Fine, build the pipeline. It’ll be delayed long enough to coincide with an oil collapse. It’s still a really poor investment. @JustinTrudeau
1394 2018-08-30 21:23:49 Why not? The Spanish olive oil people ran an RCT that made it into NEJM! Yes, it then had methodological problems....

1401 2018-08-30 21:22:46 Good to hear. To date it's been the snake oil sales folk getting the press in NZ.
1402 2018-08-30 21:22:43 They are the 6th best team in the top league full of oil rich clubs in a country the size of a continent, they can't be that bad and we put them out with 9 men, you's would have 2 dvds and a commemorative Lego spaceship out about it by now
1403 2018-08-30 21:22:38 This is crazy  I’m still getting a oil change
1404 2018-08-30 21:22:37 Dropped off my car for a S.I. and oil change at @WestBroadHonda. Had a 7:30am appt. They finished at 5:30pm. So...don't leave your car here if you're in a rush. Something so simple takes 10 hours. #greatservice #lightningfast #tenmilesamillenia

1408 2018-08-30 21:22:26 Sorry Theo but you have no clue about this.  That Pipeline is an economical nightmare.

We should have built the energy east line.  That way our oil goes to our refineries to make gas for us.  Not to mention the thousands of jobs it would have created for Canadians!
1409 2018-08-30 21:22:20 Getting my oil changed for the first time in an embarrassingly long time and my mechanic is a lady. She didn't shame me for being way over on needing my oil changed and has been super helpful. More lady mechanics, please.
1410 2018-08-30 21:22:08 @PnPCBC maybe it is time for Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba to secede from Canada and find another route to get our oil to market .
1411 2018-08-30 21:21:59 This is great. I think that in the US they would drill in the middle of Arlington Cemetery if they thought they could get a few barrels of oil from it.

We have a PA-28 161 (1981) in our flightclub, and it is showing a slightly high oil pressure. It seems to be increasing. 
* slightly high (into yellow area) at runup
* later it's slightly into yellow area at 2350 rpm aswell.

How serious is this?
1436 2018-08-30 21:19:53 Plus oil from leaking engines, brake fluid, transmission fluid, paints, solvents and whatever liquid falls on the streets. If it were only organics, there'd be less of an issue.

1453 2018-08-30 21:18:15 Andrew, this is the dumbest thing you've ever said. How is oil the cleanest and most environmentally friendly energy? Why didn't the CPC push through this project over its 10 years in power? Are you trying to ensure people don't vote for you?

1457 2018-08-30 21:17:58 I have oily skin and I swear by using oils for everything. rosehip oil (especially @PaiSkincare) is an amazing moisturizer!! (and brand for other skin goodies)
1458 2018-08-30 21:17:58 Pipelines will never impact how much oil is shipped by rail. They're explicitly meant to expand capacity, not replace it.
1459 2018-08-30 21:17:58 Dude, we need to get out of the oil business.  Come spend a summer in BC to see what climate change looks like
1460 2018-08-30 21:17:23 It's amazing! It's like Sakura paper, I think it is, bills their paper as "Performance paper". I like when my design products sell to me like they would sell F1 Engine Oil

1480 2018-08-30 21:14:42 It would be a positive move if the Prime Minister/leaders of Alberta and BC worked on a joint plan to decrease and eliminate extracting oil in Alberta. Each are say they are supporters of doing so. Start from there and engineer a plan that activates rather than blow hot air.
1481 2018-08-30 21:14:38 Well, apparently massaging with flax seed oil and things like that can help promote breast growth via increasing blood flow to that part of the body. Just something I've heard, not sure how accurate it is.

1488 2018-08-30 21:14:08 Lol
1489 2018-08-30 21:13:46 Many of us still heat with oil. Not all have access to alternatives like natural gas. Coal-fired electricity is my other option.
1490 2018-08-30 21:13:45 Alberta’s resource development is in the hands of a Canadian Government that opposes Pipelines and Tanker traffic!  Prefers Saudi Oil to Alberta Oil!  Why would Alberta stay in Confederation? There is NO future in Canada !  #albertaseparation
1491 2018-08-30 21:13:27 How does the sale of dirty #tarsands oil become a National Security Interest?
Especially when the market for such a product is drying up?
Especially when the #UniversalRights of the marine life around the coast of BC is threatened by the potential transport of this product!
1492 2018-08-30 21:13:23 What about highlights of Man City before you got bought out by an oil baron?  Wouldn't be as long as the Brighton match highlights to be fair.
1493 2018-08-30 21:13:18 I accidentally bit into a fish oil capsule and instantly regret it
1494 2018-08-30 21:13:18 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
1495 2018-08-30 21:13:08 Coconut oil and exfoliate daily.
1496 2018-08-30 21:12:57 That'd be Lifeless Reloaded 
1497 2018-08-30 21:12:47 Like oil by We Will Worsip
1498 2018-08-30 21:12:46 @HarrisAuthor Do you remember when Harper lowered the Env. Assess's protocols to make it easier for #KinderMorgan to finish the oil pipe project?
1499 2018-08-30 21:12:40 I fear that if you are yet to embrace the joys of leather willow and linseed oil you may be lost to us forever 
1500 2018-08-30 21:12:36 So sick of scams in this world stopped at a place to get an oil change in my van they had a big sign out $19.95 did my oil change and charge me 40 bucks what the f*** total b*******
1501 2018-08-30 21:12:26 @seanhannity @SarahPalinUSA @soledadobrien @michellemalkin @LeslieMarshall @rosierifka a snake oil salesman will always be a snake oil salesman
1502 2018-08-30 21:12:24 I want some of what you’re smoking bahaha jk. Oil use will increase over the next few years. Green energy is FAR from viable yet.

1504 2018-08-30 21:11:51 I'm so sorry to hear that your babies are in pain What state are you in? Do you have legal medical marijuana yet? My husband suffers from degenerative disc disease and his doctor just prescribed thc oil. It's working for him. Nobody should live with pain.
1505 2018-08-30 21:11:44 Why you so salty about wisdom? If only your intolerance was an actual disease, the black seed oil would have cured that.
1506 2018-08-30 21:11:39 I shaved my legs with coconut oil and omg ??? Why have i not done this sooner? Why legs are so soft now
1507 2018-08-30 21:11:37 nah I fully have an addiction to olbas oil
1508 2018-08-30 21:11:28 No that's not enough. They need to do an audit of everything they own, clothing etc that is oil based, all the foods that were transported to them via oil products
1509 2018-08-30 21:11:27 6. They should have fronted the costs for training and a national environmental plan
7. The oil companies should have procured an Insurance plan endorsed to Guyanese corporation, covering environmental risk, scaled to the largest spill potential based on the industrial process!
1510 2018-08-30 21:11:22 Get a grip shell you are supposed to sell oil stop virtue signalling
1511 2018-08-30 21:11:21 If you are currently using or wearing ANY petroleum based product please CEASE immediately if you claim to be against oil and pipelines. HYPOCRITE

1514 2018-08-30 21:11:12 That bike was made with oil. They should buy a Jack Ass to ride.
1515 2018-08-30 21:11:12 Toujours un plaisir de donner des conseils de cuisine à un pote. Don't use oil when you brown ur mushrooms, gives it a nice nutty flavor, straight up gangsta.
1516 2018-08-30 21:11:11 @AmbJohnBolton America liberated Iraq and handed over Iraqi oil to Iran's proxies in Iraq. America must prevent Iran's agents from controlling Iraqi oil. Iran's nails should be trimmed in Iraq.
1517 2018-08-30 21:11:07 Got my fish oil tablets, I'm doing better. See the sun for about 20 minutes per day.
1518 2018-08-30 21:11:06 Whew chile, this heat got me sweating out my Jamaican black castor oil 
1519 2018-08-30 21:11:05 You need some oil in that machine because we hear it grinding ALL OVER THE WORLD every single damn day!! Think you could STFU for one day?? Asking for literally every human being!!
1520 2018-08-30 21:11:00 Big fish in a small pond , how would man city do without all the millions? You think your club with your tinpot fans would last on our budget? Not a chance you NEEDED that arab oil money to survive. The emptyhad is like a library worst fans we have had at celtic park 
1521 2018-08-30 21:10:53 Oil mutha fu*cker, oil
1522 2018-08-30 21:10:52 020.quantity「量」
in sufficient quantity「十分な分量の」
a large/small quantity of oil「大量/少量の油」
1523 2018-08-30 21:10:51 Sorry, but OPEC have been manipulating the oil price since Pontius was a pilot. You are obviously too young to remember. Any sensible politician, who wasn't trying to sell us a pup, would know that. Salmond was, and is, a Charlatan.
1524 2018-08-30 21:10:42 I’m pretty sure TMX is the trade-off for getting AB support for CTax. Without AB, there’d be no MB or SK support. If CPC wins next year, TMX will be the least of your concerns. Stopping TMX doesn’t stop a single person from burning oil.
1525 2018-08-30 21:10:32 That they are employed (people working "...in the oil and gas industry")- so who are we to judge their occupation?
1526 2018-08-30 21:10:29 Then registered to National Petroleum Corporation/Fund as its asset base with oil companies pay that corporation discrete fees
4. All explorations and initial pumping should be financed by oil companies
5. Oil companies should’ve fronted costs for domestic regulator
1527 2018-08-30 21:10:19 Sis this ain't it..... Clarence don't play & she said no toxic stuff now the oil prank yes but the other one no
1528 2018-08-30 21:10:19 Getting an oil change pray I don’t get ripped off pls n thnx
1529 2018-08-30 21:10:18 and a stream of enormous oil tankers
1530 2018-08-30 21:10:12 おはようございまーす！
パンさん名前変わりすぎぃ！(笑)
1531 2018-08-30 21:10:07 My guess is the fellas on the oil rig give you a fairly difficult time!
1532 2018-08-30 21:10:05 おっぱいって結局は脂肪だろ？少し胸についてるからって僕を巨乳キャラにするなよ。
1533 2018-08-30 21:09:48 @AmbJohnBolton America should work to raise Iraqi oil production to 10 million barrels and cover America's need for oil free of charge and in turn raise oil prices to prevent the Chinese economic rise
1534 2018-08-30 21:09:20 Yes, his CPC Gov. lowered the environmental protocols. This permitted the oil tycoon to bypass most of the required consultations with First Nations. Is he @jkenney going to deny this?
1535 2018-08-30 21:08:58 Was on the bench when oil won the cup in 90
1536 2018-08-30 21:08:55 Too many people ask how I keep my skin clear. Lmao I'm finna start charging to tell you mfs to wash ya face with water and lather in some type of oil (peppermint, jojoba, grapeseed). Let it set. Rinse. Hydrate. Twice a day.
1537 2018-08-30 21:08:53 Nuru style full body? Enjoy. And the perv in me can think of many volunteers who would offer u an oil or stone treatment free! Probably not close to as good as experts
1538 2018-08-30 21:08:52 Would those CBD oil pens help you?? They won’t get you high like regular weed but it definitely would calm you down
1539 2018-08-30 21:08:42 So basically oil was leaking & the engine shut off , there was a lot of smoke coming out . We pulled over but if we would’ve continued, the car would’ve caught on fire & blow up .
1540 2018-08-30 21:08:38 It means bigger than deluxe and smaller than leader. The word you're looking for might be "oil prices".
1541 2018-08-30 21:08:38 In clinic today, I recommended to two separate patients that they consider stopping fish oil, given lack of obvious benefit.  The response from both?  "Is there any harm from continuing it?  No?  I'll stay on it."  So much for evidence based medicine.
1542 2018-08-30 21:08:21 This is agonizing to watch. Can you imagine the incredulous reaction of players in the US oil sector?
1543 2018-08-30 21:08:20 @marlenebloom2  I take issue with something you said about Andrew Gillum.  I submit to  you that someone who rejects oil, pharma, and wallstreet money is MUCH  MORE of a dem than someone who gladly takes it.  Argue otherwise please.
1544 2018-08-30 21:08:14 Dear sweet Guyana has already made all the cardinal mistakes of failure: 1. It’s a bad contract!
2. Oil companies should’ve paid for independent assessments
3. Oil finds should’ve been indexed based on the actual amounts of oil which could be brought to market!

1546 2018-08-30 21:07:56 With Hydro power, plus one car is electric that commutes everyday, the other old gas car for the self employed working from home dad.  Nobody is saying going cold turkey on oil but we surely can ween off of it.  Rather breath in August than worry about jobs.
1547 2018-08-30 21:07:56 .. @JustinTrudeau so alberta tarsands has trouble getting good price for it's "oil", yet in Canada gasoline prices are ~$1.50+ a litre?  So why not refine at home, sell at home, for massive profits?  Oh yeah, that bastard Harper sold the tarsands to china... #CDNpoli
1548 2018-08-30 21:07:55 That depends. How expensive will it be to spread motor oil over the whole show but still be able to see it

1551 2018-08-30 21:07:29 Big Oil took all their tax breaks and cash taxpayer subsidies to demonize Jimmy Carter when he was President,  and stupid Americans let them get away with it.
1552 2018-08-30 21:07:25 That's because, like Salmond, they didn't know that OPEC was going to uncharacteristically not cut oil production in response to an over supply of markets hence the price collapsed.
1553 2018-08-30 21:07:22 Greasy gas stations are the best kind of gas stations. That means they're getting stuff done. If you have a clean gas station, there's not going to be any oil, grease, or gas in sight. I'll take my gas stations greasy, TYVM! #MAGA

1556 2018-08-30 21:07:03 While oil companies, federal & provincial governments & Canadians are looking for a way to overcome yet another hurdle in building a pipeline, political handlers of @Alberta_UCP are celebrating what they perceive to be an electoral win. How pathetic. Hope it’s noticed. #ABleg

1558 2018-08-30 21:06:47 Irving, Texas based ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) & NY based Hess (NYSE: HES) have made several finds of oil off Guyana's coast, and believe the reserves are real big. This tiny English speaking South American country is poised to become a top oil producer in a few years down the line.
1559 2018-08-30 21:06:44 Canada’s the ONLY top 10 oil exporter facing an increasing cost of carbon, yet pipeline opposition is the same as it’s always been. 

Is this social license?

1560 2018-08-30 21:06:41 You lost. Quit trying to be Stephen Harper, show some true leadership and invest in clean energy and a future we have some chance of surviving. Making oil sands deals while the country literally burns is as myopic as it gets.
1561 2018-08-30 21:06:39 For 45years I didn't know I had PTSD. That alone has caused irreversible damage. I continue to fight and I take CBD oil to ward off demons. Hang in there. If you want to know about CBD oil without THC,  DM me. 
1562 2018-08-30 21:06:34 She’s been Trudeau’s lapdog from the get go. His policies are her policies. They both hate oil.

1566 2018-08-30 21:06:02 Oil — “The cleanest, most ethical, environmentally-friendly energy in the world.”  Must be right up there with coal. 
1567 2018-08-30 21:06:00 @CortesSteve if Drumpf told you to say motor oil tasted like chocolate you’d be on tv arguing that point until your death. So if I said you suck a chimps dick then I guess that would be true as well. And you’re no match for @angela_rye, she eats u alive every time. #brokenrecord

1569 2018-08-30 21:05:57 I’m quite sure the aluminum that you speak of was produced right here, not over in Asia where this oil is heading.
1570 2018-08-30 21:05:41 Of course it won't. @POTUS is laughing all the way to the bank. He's getting our oil at pennies on the dollar, and this announcement just ensured he will keep buying on the cheap for maybe years.
1571 2018-08-30 21:05:37 Aww get you some fresh cloves and make it into an oil. If you just place them in your mouth it’ll instantly numb it.
1572 2018-08-30 21:05:34 Of the top ten oil exporters, Canada is the only country with emission guidelines, resource extraction caps, CO2 storage innovation and 700,000 barrels we import daily from often despotic regimes, have no such laws or guidelines. No?
1573 2018-08-30 21:05:30 include investments in industries such as oil, entertainment, coal, aluminum, petrochemicals and plastics, telecommunications, media, and real estate.[citation needed]

1576 2018-08-30 21:04:53 Good it also be a message to Saudi that 9/11 isn't over & America will be compensated & their American allies that helped them do it will be prosecuted I'm thinking public hangings starting with Bush jr. & lifetime of free oil from saudi? retweet if you agree
1577 2018-08-30 21:04:43 I am now boycotting all my groceries that contain PALM OIL. That includes Cadbury chocolates.
1578 2018-08-30 21:04:39 Is it correct that CBD oil from the stavia plant is for daytime use and indica is for night time use?

1584 2018-08-30 21:04:13 Who cares ? You more interested in texas oil companies or canadas coast ?
1585 2018-08-30 21:04:09 Did you guys see the price of oil. It's over $70. We need $MMEX to get moving and enjoy some of these high prices.

1590 2018-08-30 21:03:46 I am elated that KM has been derailed.  I am very sorry for the workers who will be thrown out of work through no fault of their own.  I am devastated that you have purchased the KM pipeline.  We cannot expand the oil sands and meet our emissions targets.  Please think again.
1591 2018-08-30 21:03:39 As I told you a long time ago already @Lotuslander1000 it’s about shipping oil to Asia.

1597 2018-08-30 21:02:38 Today, @BLMAlaska issued a final EIS for @COP_Alaska's GMT2 oil development. @BOEM_DOI also just released final EIS for Hilcorp's Liberty oil development in fed Arctic waters. That means 2 major oil developments in the Arctic could get final thumbs up as soon as October 1.
1598 2018-08-30 21:02:36 I've been rubbing tea tree oil all over my face chanting, "I banish thee from my face!"

1599 2018-08-30 21:02:34 Absolutely great news! Hopefully a message to END OIL!
1600 2018-08-30 21:02:27 Robyn. You’re picking at straws here. You know full well what Andrew meant “Canada’s oil in the most ethically produced oil in the world. “. Don’t be a typical CBC shrew!

Stop moving around oil that doesn't want to be moved.
1604 2018-08-30 21:02:10 Sorry did I hurt your feeling? Pretty sure we could still ship oil without it having to leave by water.
1605 2018-08-30 21:02:07 Yea but America uses proceeds from oil to make rich people richer. So who’s the winner? ;)

1609 2018-08-30 21:01:38 this is not flippant. how can you make that statement without reviewing (having made public) his writings and his past. to do so is nor more than following the heard..to paraphrase comrade pee pee pants..i like people who think for themselves, not those who drink the snake oil
1610 2018-08-30 21:01:31 6. They should have fronted the costs for training and a national environmental plan

1618 2018-08-30 21:00:20 So, you think oil from Venezuela and Saudi is better than Canadian oil??? Last time I looked Canada has environmental standards that are superior to these countries I’ve just mentioned. Take care of your own backyard before you go walking in mine.
1619 2018-08-30 21:00:14 Oh we talking!  DM us your zip code and we'll get you pricing and your closest location  Oil prices vary by region, but the most expensive a conventional oil change could be is $19.99 with a coupon!

1624 2018-08-30 21:00:05 In other news, just tried a drop of CBD oil and now my mouth tastes like fresh hay.
1625 2018-08-30 21:00:01 The Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries announced an embargo on oil exports to the United States on October 15, 1973.

1627 2018-08-30 20:59:44 Oil pipelines are bad. Period. Quit being horrible capitalist humans. If you're going to be money hungry assholes can you at least do it with clean renewable energy. THANKS
1628 2018-08-30 20:59:42 We are the only country in the world to lock in our oil and decimate the industry except maybe for Venezuela.
1629 2018-08-30 20:59:42 Iran’s oil exports are already dropping fast as refiners try to find alternatives ahead of a re-imposition of U.S. sanctions in early November,which in turn is draining a glut of unsold oil.
1630 2018-08-30 20:59:40 It's a torch. An oil soaked rag is wrapped around it.
1631 2018-08-30 20:59:11 1. The contract is poorly drawn
2. Guyana should have had the oil companies pay for independent assessment of the oil finds
3. The oil finds should have been indexed once verified, and based on the actual amounts of oil which could be brought to market.
1632 2018-08-30 20:58:49 PRE-LABOR DAY SALE: Members receive 40% off all vitamins and supplements, with 30% off bars and drinks. Stop by to re-up on your multi, fish oil, or protein!  Sale ends tomorrow, 8/31. Hurry in!
1633 2018-08-30 20:58:45 for those thinking of stock market . Most successfully investors avoid oil at all cost. Oil is the organized crime. High risk. God is secured. Banks gIves good dividends. Industrialize are good. Oil is to avoid  unless you want loose thousands$$$$.
1634 2018-08-30 20:58:40 Scientific studies are being censored and shut down because the findings are politically inconvenient. It happened before with oil and coal and climate change. Now it happens with human behavior. Right. Left. Right. Left. Hypocrites all.
1635 2018-08-30 20:58:12 Or move on because it’s still not going to happen. Time to refine in Alberta, increase jobs and use our own oil. That plus boost other industries.
1636 2018-08-30 20:57:53 Climate change is very real, and oil is shitty and dirty, and pipelines are the safest way to transport it.
1637 2018-08-30 20:57:47 I agree the pipeline purchase is a scandal, but don’t think you’re fooling us. 

We know you’re in bed with the oil and gas industry and would sacrifice us all to enrich it even more.
1638 2018-08-30 20:57:40 Stop making sense. It's bad for (oil companies') business.
1639 2018-08-30 20:57:28 Haha looks like natives 1. Texas oil company zero  oops i mean  harpers cons since they are who messed up the neb  to cause this
1640 2018-08-30 20:57:25 Pagamentos da subvenção ao óleo diesel: até o momento, foram aprovados pagamentos a 4 empresas: em 26/7, Dax Oil Refino S/A e Refinaria de Petróleo Riograndense S.A; em 17/8, Petro Energia Indústria e Comércio Ltda e Sul Plata Trading Brasil Ltda, referentes à primeira fase.
1641 2018-08-30 20:57:18 The research on the benefits of CBD oil is amazing. Just look at what Australia's doing
1642 2018-08-30 20:57:09 Americans are getting Canadian oil for WAAAAYYYY below WTI pricing!  A BARGAIN!
1643 2018-08-30 20:57:03 Yo pagué 34,25 el viernes pasado a 500km de capital la super, no quiero saber a cuánto va estar y el oil arriba de 70dolares.
1644 2018-08-30 20:57:01 Strip the leaf part off the stop & cut into strips ... then saute it in garlic & olive oil ... IDK about the stalk part ...
1645 2018-08-30 20:56:57 Yes it will! The deal’s all wrong. Guyana’s demonstrated its inexperience and naïveté. It’ll never see a dime of windfalls but is already talking about a Sovereign Fund. It controls not a single lever that gets the oil to market, or influences or sets pricing, yet it bears costs!
1646 2018-08-30 20:56:49 Because we & the world need it, and until a more cheaper & powerful solution is found (solar or something similar) the world will always need it. It’s better the oil is exported to other countries from us rather than the Middle East cause we still care for the environment.
1647 2018-08-30 20:56:36 Do u have to compare his career with a club? as a fan u here in 9ja u may not see any of dem d rest of ur life! None of dem visited Calabar when dose man utd fans died being electrocuted watching man u match.they don't knw u exist Common menh u 've got 2 put some oil in ur brain
1648 2018-08-30 20:56:21 What a bloody expensive mess-again. That oil should have been pulled 10 years ago;all the techy stuff this world can do, don't believe we can't build most sophisticated alarm & recover system 'if' pipe leaks? Trains & trailers kill people&environment annually. Oil rich, cash poor
1649 2018-08-30 20:56:18 The CBD oil I got is really working out for me. No panic attacks, no pains.
I feel great.

Why the fuck is weed still illegal again?
1650 2018-08-30 20:56:12 I’ve promised you authenticity, honesty and openness. Take this how you wish and I’ll spare you the step by step. Coconut oil is the world’s greatest lubricant. I can’t help where your mind goes with this. Once the ball leaves the bat, I can’t steer it.
1651 2018-08-30 20:55:53 Did you bump your head on something? How is oil any of that?
1652 2018-08-30 20:55:50 The doula even named the hospitals in the DC area that do the baby shampoo technique: UMC, Howard, and GW just switched to mineral oil.
1653 2018-08-30 20:55:36 He was also encouraged to borrow heavily when the price of oil was high, later debt repayments were crippling.
1654 2018-08-30 20:55:19 But I’ll be honest, my research is solely coming from what I’ve read online. I’ve not asked anyone in the oil or conservation. industry. Guess we’ll have to wait and see what the Government and courts decide.
1655 2018-08-30 20:54:49 Hassan slick as oil lmaoooo but nah I’m not goin
1656 2018-08-30 20:54:36 There's an oil I've been wanting to order for MONTHS, but the other stuff I need was cheaper so I have to wait another month :/ Hopefully I won't run out of my sample. #chronicpainstruggles

1659 2018-08-30 20:54:10 Maybe he thinks the pipeline carries olive oil?
1660 2018-08-30 20:54:06 Nothing like fear mongering and lies on a Wednesday, Teddy. I guess years of grovelling to the White House pervert and begging money from oil donors has left you very little to campaign on. #BetoForSenate #countryoverparty #ComplicitGOP

1662 2018-08-30 20:53:58 None of them, that’s the point. My friend Eduardo made $300,000 betting oil futures one summer and Eduardo won’t come close to getting in. The ability to make money doesn’t impress anybody around here.

1664 2018-08-30 20:53:50 When you go for an oil change and they tell you 10 other things wrong with your car 
1665 2018-08-30 20:53:50 Please defend by putting a lot more effort into moving Alberta into other industries. Refining in Alberta so we can use our own oil and stop importing would also be good.
1666 2018-08-30 20:53:46 Using a setting spray before primer if your oily. It helps keep the oil in.

1669 2018-08-30 20:53:36 Why would it?  Americans are getting Canadian oil for bottom barrel prices!!! Well under WTI!
1670 2018-08-30 20:53:33 How about sending petroleum East. Start shutting dow Saudi imports. 
There’s oil on every continent. Why fill the oceans?
1671 2018-08-30 20:53:14 I think the 700% stat being stated is fact. They know how more oil would be transported to the coast, and they know how much oil a tanker can carry.
1672 2018-08-30 20:53:14 Note it won't be any indigenous dollars going into this disaster. They don't pay taxes. Also stop their royalty cheques from the oil sands & other crude sources. No more on reserve gas stations for them either.
1673 2018-08-30 20:53:13 I agree the world is moving to clean energy but in the meantime we can other monetize our oil reserves responsibly or watch other irresponsible countries benefit while Canada punishes itself.
1674 2018-08-30 20:52:58 try peppermint essential oil along your hairline!!! it works like magic
1675 2018-08-30 20:52:56 @BlairKing_ca is a lobbyist for Big Oil and a troll.

Don’t take lessons!

1676 2018-08-30 20:52:49 I feel the same way about the term “offshore.” Are they on a boat? An oil rig?
1677 2018-08-30 20:52:46 Welp. 

- Took much longer to drive to MD than planned. Almost got hit twice.
- My car was misreading the oil % so I've been riding on 0% oil for idk how long.
- The ghastly potholes on 295/Balt-Wash Pkwy knocked my alignment out of whack.

1685 2018-08-30 20:51:58 Why did I leave my book at work and not bring it with me to read at the oil change place??? 
1686 2018-08-30 20:51:56 Will the CBD oil manufacturers be represented. Although CBD oil does not have the THC
1687 2018-08-30 20:51:50 We need the lights on so Saudi tankers can sail in to off load all that good oil.
1688 2018-08-30 20:51:45 Pele, someone with PhD in local politics. So you want us to forget about all the looting under PDP for 16 yrs when price of crude oil was high but expect PMB to turn the country into Eldorado in less than 4 yrs when the price is low? You are sick you just haven't admitted it yet
1689 2018-08-30 20:51:36 Yup @RachelNotley will apply a carbon tax they will advance BS wind and solar they will cap oil sands emissions they will outlaw coal.... and that will give us a pipeline #resign
1690 2018-08-30 20:51:25 I don’t think you understand. 

1) It was the railroad that was transporting the oil, not the oil company.

2) PIPELINES ARE SAFER THAN RAILROADS.
1691 2018-08-30 20:51:21 You mean Venezuela's oil reserves.

1698 2018-08-30 20:50:12 im so cold my house has no heating because i haven't bought oil yet..............but am I willing to fork over 100 hundo?? How else will I be able to buy Worthless Shit
1699 2018-08-30 20:50:03 I’m getting my oil changed at walmart, and they are cleaning my windshield. Thanks but my window was clean, I just need my oil changed. Now I know why it takes an hour and a half
1700 2018-08-30 20:49:57 Time to restrict oil exports to BC through the existing Kinder Morgan pipeline. You passed the legislation now use it
1701 2018-08-30 20:49:40 What are you smoking Theo? We are replacing oil with solar, wind, hydro-electric and other renewable sources. Plus, the investment in these alternative energy sources is leading to potentially new breakthroughs. Oil is on it's deathbed!
1702 2018-08-30 20:49:37 There is another (grade) level of OIL that is ready to leak......
But you parked at the wrong pump!!!!

Somebody will catch this!!!

1709 2018-08-30 20:48:52 I would suggest more to backwardation is moderaing, as mkt comes to grips with structural change in oil pricing, versus mere short-term (spot) pressures. Recent steep backwardation signalled lack of mkt commitment to spot $ reflecting systemic s/d shift. But just MO.
1710 2018-08-30 20:48:26 Not a stupid question. Yes. Hemp is a different variety that contains no THC and has no psychoactive effects. While cannabidiol (CBD) can be extracted from it, it's not the same CBD as from marijuana plants. This is the "legal" stuff you can order online. Basically snake oil.
1711 2018-08-30 20:48:22 avocado oil chips are the best shit tho!!!! belieeeeeeve & thank me later
1712 2018-08-30 20:48:20 well, i did my normal l.o.c. routine w/ castor oil. the flaking isn't too bad, but i'll probably try coconut next time.

1715 2018-08-30 20:47:43 are you seriously comparing those micro events to the billions the country would generate with global oil sales. LOL
1716 2018-08-30 20:47:43 ... the oil & regime change.
1717 2018-08-30 20:47:23 Every time a tv show portrays casual anal sex I'm just horrified like my dudessss you need some sort of fucking lubricant in there.... even olive oil, chapstick... something but not putting that in dry
1718 2018-08-30 20:47:21 #Oil is rigged higher to save the banks from their fracking loans.  #Silver is rigged lower, to hide the fact the monetary system is being destroyed by debasement.
1719 2018-08-30 20:47:17 Yessss you gotta get some! Just make sure you get the wake and bake oil to go with it!
1720 2018-08-30 20:47:10 This is an important matter that needs wide attention
The transport of oil from offshore platfroms in eastern Canada was not a component of environmental assessment though it is difficult to understand how it couldn't have been? - So obvious at the time.
1721 2018-08-30 20:46:43 That baby oil my friend.
1722 2018-08-30 20:46:27 He was right the oil belonged to the people but the oil industry needed investment . When no investment was put the oil stopped flowing. Then no money for the industry or the people.
1723 2018-08-30 20:46:25 So, admit that oil has advantage, but still believe ethanol can/should compete with oil?! How rich. You don’t think ethanol is a worldwide market?!
1724 2018-08-30 20:46:17 Looks like the Oil chart when it was at $74. Trendline had to be redrawn due to breakouts.
1725 2018-08-30 20:46:14 Olive Oil is a fruit juice.
1726 2018-08-30 20:46:14 Yes Howard and how about all the crap the big Cities dump into the waters those whales that everyone is so worried about live in. Those toxins are as bad if not worse than an Oil Spill which "might" happen.
1727 2018-08-30 20:46:08 Hello!! I’m very interested in this! And think I fit your brief. :3 I paint oil portraits of female characters from games.
1728 2018-08-30 20:46:06 Yes, but that is counteracted to some degree by technological progress. The peak oil folks downplay that issue, but it is critical for understanding future trends.
1729 2018-08-30 20:46:03 Wish my area had enough people that bowled for places to justify doing that! I'm bloody excited that the one local center oils the entire house every Sunday morning, otherwise local houses only oil for leagues and just let the weekends ride.
1730 2018-08-30 20:46:00 Madhur Jaffrey is a good bet! Basically you cook lentils until soft with nothing except water and turmeric (no salt while cooking as it makes pulses hard). Then once soft you make the tarka with finely sliced onion and chillies and spices fried in oil and tip the whole lot in

1733 2018-08-30 20:45:44 Do you mix an oil with it that helps sometimes
1734 2018-08-30 20:45:43 May your oil never dry sir.
1735 2018-08-30 20:45:24 we can make it by just dumping capsaicin sauce/oil on a Samyang 
1736 2018-08-30 20:45:19 How do you even get out of bed in the morning, better yet why?  Shipping oil is going to cause forest fires? What a reach!!! Have a great day
1737 2018-08-30 20:45:18 Getting it back in a couple of hours! Cracked oil pan, which led to a bunch of other damage before I broke down on Sepulveda at rush hour. It could have been worse.
1738 2018-08-30 20:44:53 I’m saddened that journalists are so lazy that this is their go-to source for self-fulfilling prophecies. This paid oil company shill isn’t even remotely accurate most of the time.
1739 2018-08-30 20:44:44 In addition to Tire Kingdom, Ponte Vedra Beach, FL blowing up my car engine due to a faulty Oil change, they also had a tow truck back into my Son's car over a year ago & cause several thousand $$ of damage. Once again, they took no responsibility/accountability. Be warned!!
1740 2018-08-30 20:44:42 Avenatti  is a snake oil salesman - anyone who cant see that is a sheep of the MSM.
1741 2018-08-30 20:44:38 He spilled his lard, but everything is oil right now.
1742 2018-08-30 20:44:26 This from a guy who sold his TV station to Qatar backed Al Jazeera one of the largest oil producers in the world, what a hypocrite. I wish his manision would fall into the Pacific.

1747 2018-08-30 20:44:03 I have been using Ylang oil from the tsv,a shop assistant told me that my skin looked gorgeous today (no make up). Absolutely thrilled. Thank you for fab products!
1748 2018-08-30 20:43:55 I had olive oil ice-cream once and it was *amazing*  sometimes weird flavours work!
1749 2018-08-30 20:43:36 As weather cools/dries I'll gradually transition to richer/more oil based stuff, in the current sale I got a small Fresh Lotus cream for night and their Seaberry skin nutrition booster which is an oil that can be added to anything
1750 2018-08-30 20:43:27 If you’re so much against oil and pipelines.   Move to the bush and live there. You’re a bully and only see one side of the bigger picture. So sad your a politician.
1751 2018-08-30 20:43:02 How will we ship refined product within Canada, when we don't have a pipeline to the east coast?  Regardless of the product we still need a pipeline.  The refineries in ON, QU and NB can refine AB oil.  Why build more refineries, we have enough.  What we need are pipelines!
1752 2018-08-30 20:42:43 SNP do all they can to avoid scrutiny. Look at the FOI scandal. Look at the PLO committee plant attempt. Look at releasing the oil bulletin with non existent oil tax revenues on the last day of Holyrood. No news release on NHS waiting times on Tuesday. Like your wish but  ....
1753 2018-08-30 20:42:39 i went to the kitchen to get olive oil and dish soap to clean my beauty blender and i got distracted and accidentally drank 2 cups of coffee and now i'm too shakey to finish my makeup

1757 2018-08-30 20:42:20 No but some fresh pasta and olive oil maybe!
1758 2018-08-30 20:42:06 Sounds like Pete is unclear on the idea: yes, workers are disrupted partly so that people understand and value the infrastructure, the labour, the lives impacted. The disruption of native lives when their land is threatened by oil production is far greater than a morning’s worth.
1759 2018-08-30 20:42:06 When you scowl a lot of bottle of oil, you feel full of comic book.
1760 2018-08-30 20:41:30 I had a feeling today to not get a chalupa box from @tacobell and I was right because my cinnamon twists just taste like old oil . Win some lose some

1766 2018-08-30 20:40:25 Because not *expanding* the tar sands, increasing climate change,  and destroying huge tracts of BC, equates to stopping oil production all over the world. Get a brain

1803 2018-08-30 20:35:22 You can use any kind of oil, WD-40, or even moisturizer (though it doesn't work as well but it does work in a pinch!). Just ask them for anything goopy--wait no no no dont do that oh god

1805 2018-08-30 20:35:10 As my car headlights are dim after 10 years, I decided to replace both assemblies. Quoted $800 for parts &labor. But, one mgr. advised to buy the parts and he would put them on for $200 total. That saved me $400. He gets my oil changes etc for life now 
1806 2018-08-30 20:35:04 Oops, I dropped oil from the tahini jar on my foot, said every vegan ever.
1807 2018-08-30 20:34:58 Agreed. The carbon tax was just an accuse to expand the oil sands. It was a ruse to make the rest of the country pay for the industry's ever increasing pollution.
1808 2018-08-30 20:34:54 even tho changing my oil literally does nothing to my car besides extending the life of my engine, I feel like the car runs better :3c

1809 2018-08-30 20:34:52 I wonder if scraping the pipeline idea is best for Canada. Maybe develop refineries and use the oil/gas within Canada? less dependence on other countries, more reliable supply, Canadian jobs!!!

1820 2018-08-30 20:33:34 Abdulla, I understand your view but that does not diminish the value of oil  in storage. Declining inventories means that there are buyers paying real money for the oil. Play valuations that I do suggest that there are large areas of the plays that break-even at < $60/barrel
1821 2018-08-30 20:33:32 Is there not planned increase of freighter traffic in Burrard inlet/Salish Sea that isn’t oil related.
1822 2018-08-30 20:33:25 Rockets are the best use for oil. And @elonmusk knows that...
1823 2018-08-30 20:33:18 You are correct! And that oil would be sold at an amount much higher than we are getting today. Imagine having more money for our social projects, wouldn't that be swell?

1838 2018-08-30 20:31:42 Canada’s inability to move oil out results in gluts at home and huge price differentials to WTI.  That means Canadians are effectively subsidizing other exporters.  Saudi Arabia, in particular.
1839 2018-08-30 20:31:41 Not an expert in oilfield in AB, but is it time to refine our oil, sell cheaply to Albertans, and market price to those provinces or states that want it? Cut off BC completely.

1872 2018-08-30 20:27:36 yes it was their choice which is my exact point, Norway's cost for oil transport is less because they don't need pipelines so the example is nonsensical in any respect. The fact is that a lot of the pipeline talk was when oil prices were high. Now it's a losing game tax or not.
1873 2018-08-30 20:27:31 You criticized the PC on northern gateway.  You hired anti oil people as advisers and you sat on you hands,  ooops you stopped wine imports for a week.  You and your NDP messed up.  And you continue to mess up.

1893 2018-08-30 20:24:51 #Graze's fries are made from fresh cut Kennebec potatoes, twice-fried Belgian-style in Non-GMO rice bran oil and seasoned with kosher salt.
1894 2018-08-30 20:24:25 Obviously you’re applying cuticle oil to your nails.
1895 2018-08-30 20:24:17 Adds coconut oil to shopping list haha

1897 2018-08-30 20:24:06 Chop seven ounces of olive oil then lower the temperature.
1898 2018-08-30 20:24:02 My goal this month is to have a full tank of oil #winteriscoming lol
1899 2018-08-30 20:24:01 To add the money for the Ekok Mamfe Bamenda highway and Mamfe Kumba highway came completely from the EU and Japan. Meanwhile dictator Biya wasted $150 million of #SouthernCameroons oil revenues for his private trips to Geneva.
1900 2018-08-30 20:23:52 The wonders of coconut oil
1901 2018-08-30 20:23:50 But wouldn’t it be great if we could reduce our dependency on oil and focus more attention on sustainable resources.
1902 2018-08-30 20:23:38 @chigrl What do you think about OIL? do you have a recent graph?
1903 2018-08-30 20:23:23 Idk where I’d be without Argan oil
1904 2018-08-30 20:23:22 : “Maestra, you always smell like.... like... like a strong baby odor”.

(It’s coconut oil lol )
1905 2018-08-30 20:22:59 男性向けみたいなエロ同人かくかも
なんにせよ起きてから
1906 2018-08-30 20:22:52 If we begin to end our dependency on oil, it will create a market for innovation to compensate. Also, we cannot wait for a gradual switchover, as oil is harming the environment NOW. If we wait much longer, it will be too late (2).
1907 2018-08-30 20:22:50 I never supported:  1) sending our troops into the Middle East to stabilized the region to help the oil companies; 2)sending US$ & help to SaudiArabia to blow up Yemen; 3) asking our men and women to die to create a third party in the Syrian civil war. I never cheated on my wife.
1908 2018-08-30 20:22:50 I’m not ballsy enough to try going without setting powder. My face would be an oil slick.
1909 2018-08-30 20:22:48 Will the hotel concierge have coconut oil? 
1910 2018-08-30 20:22:41 Andrew Shier is a liar. The oil sands pipeline is not in the national interest because not every Canadian wants it.
1911 2018-08-30 20:22:33 *Enjoying the sand, sea, sun and my sexy wife, her eyes glisten with the sparkle of the sun.  The coconut oil makes her skin glisten making her look good enough to eat.  She jumps into the water and swims around as I follow her wrapping my arms our lips dance in perfect harmony~
1912 2018-08-30 20:22:26 It requires oil. Don’t forget that part.
1913 2018-08-30 20:22:21 As far as only fuel cost is concerned, ur son and fawad both r right. However, to operate heli/aircraft and to calculate cost of per hour other factors like maintenance cost, staff salaries, other consumables/expandables, engine oil, hydraulics etc are also key 1/2
1914 2018-08-30 20:22:20 Where do I find pumpkin spice vape oil? 
1915 2018-08-30 20:22:14 You go in for an oil change for 24.99 you come out with a seven billion three hundred and sixty two katrillion dollar bill!!!! Almost made me want to drive home to my daddy lol!!!!
1916 2018-08-30 20:22:07 i.e., those suffering from anxiety can get Xanax but not CBD oil. Those with insomnia, Ambien but not CBD oil. Despite mountains of research on risks of former.
1917 2018-08-30 20:22:06 You’re wrong. Demand for global oil will collapse in 10-15 years. Even if it does sustain, the despots can have it. The rest of the world is going to move forward with clean tech.
1918 2018-08-30 20:22:01 I like Gun Oil. It keeps my dick slick.
1919 2018-08-30 20:21:57 Gambling money lol what is this a casino now we invested when we had to Liverpool were poor over long time now we had to invest and we have superbly and were coming for the title and city our transfers over the years has been dog shit city's is oil money every damn window
1920 2018-08-30 20:21:56 Time to send oil back north through Alaska?? What other hail Mary options do you have??  Oh right hide under a rock. Keep them tmx construction tweets and  photos coming....your sheeple might still vote to keep u as a real party
1921 2018-08-30 20:21:53 If oil sands are clean, go take a bath there.
1922 2018-08-30 20:21:46 That's the same way I do it. I probably do soak mine waaay too long, though. I might have to try a honey infusion or just do budder/coconut oil next time.
1923 2018-08-30 20:21:40 Oh not just learning oh,any sort of development whatsoever. I’ll keep on saying it , the oil boom was one of the worst things that happened to Nigeria.
1924 2018-08-30 20:21:40 I need my oil changed so I was gonna go get a filter and oil... but I’d rather spend my night with Logan and cook a good dinner so I think I’m gonna skip the oil and filter 
1925 2018-08-30 20:21:38 We don’t need your oil. 
We don’t need your vodka.
We don’t need your ASSet (Trump)!
Can we return him???
1926 2018-08-30 20:21:35 Thieves essential oil. Diffuse it.
1927 2018-08-30 20:21:29 Kicks NDP govt in the nuts. Kicks oil producers in the nuts. Damages AB & Canadian economy. Eagerly await some more snark #notremotely
1928 2018-08-30 20:21:17 Absolutely not. The 21 eligible medical conditions required for medical cannabis are far more severe than those suffered by many folks accessing CBD oil. This ruling now removes access for those in-between folks.
1929 2018-08-30 20:21:08 I can neither confirm nor deny the rumors.

Buy stock in coconut oil.
1930 2018-08-30 20:21:07 Ori and red oil 
1931 2018-08-30 20:20:55 If we continue to invest and expand oil production/reliance, what will be the motivation to invest in cleaner sources? In addition, what is to prevent the oil Corps. from wielding their economic power to surprise cleaner tech, as they have already done in the past? (1).
1932 2018-08-30 20:20:42 Hey BC, oil is used for so many things and its profits provide for many social programs. It has to get to market. Would you rather it was moved by rail? @CPC_HQ @liberal_party
1933 2018-08-30 20:20:42 Without pipelines more oil goes on trains which is more expensive = less profits and inherently more dangerous. Therefore a critical piece of infrastructure for Canada and our economy
1934 2018-08-30 20:20:28 Can somebody explain whybchillies get hotter everybday you reheat them? The piri piri oil that was quite mild three days ago just blew off my head when I used the same tray for the third day to roast potatoes.
1935 2018-08-30 20:20:19 Stop heckling Henderson 
1936 2018-08-30 20:20:19 Agreed. U.S. refineries are literally printing money.  Buying heavily discounted Canadian oil and selling gas at WTI pricesbv
1937 2018-08-30 20:20:17 Is Safaree dildo gonna come with some of that coconut oil he be selling ?
1938 2018-08-30 20:20:13 Como ves l oil?
1939 2018-08-30 20:20:09 Global oil demand will increase through 2040. Cdn oil is produced to the best standards in the world. Demand then filled by despots not Canada = planet loses. The pipeline would provide $2.4 $B/yr in gov't revenue which could be used for health care, education and innovation.
1940 2018-08-30 20:20:02 @MarkMaddenX Thank me later. Colloidal silver and black seed oil for gut health and IBS which u may have

1945 2018-08-30 20:19:37 Hey @superdrug, I always buy your #GoCrueltyFree own-brand products but just spotted Ascorbyl Palmitate in the ingredients. Is this sustainable palm oil? Please follow @IcelandFoods and ban palm oil from all your products. #SayNoToDirtyPalmOil

It's going to be an Anointing Service. Come with bottles of oil

Open Gate shall be your testimony!
1949 2018-08-30 20:19:11 Oil?
1950 2018-08-30 20:19:06 And where are these “cleaner oil” countries?
1951 2018-08-30 20:18:59 [拡散希望]調味料&食材botさん繋がりましょう。みんなを揚げたり絡めたり、ギトギトにしてあげます。
1952 2018-08-30 20:18:48 Funny how i can comment to newscientist but to nature its not letting me at moment....also even the mda(muscular destroy association)  is looking more at cbd oil for dmd...no synthetic needed if were smart
1953 2018-08-30 20:18:46 I once blocked someone for suggesting flax oil 
1954 2018-08-30 20:18:35 The gov led by Pt Medina has paid off 98% of its debt to Venezuela’s state-owned oil firm (Pdvsa), (which exceeded US$4bn), thanks to a debt renegotiation agreement. The deal comes as Venezuela’s chronic economic crisis continues to deepen due to the crash in international price
1955 2018-08-30 20:18:24 Exactly! I will begin to respect @Greenpeace when they protest oil production in Saudi Arabia. Waiting...
1956 2018-08-30 20:18:20 PSA: if you’re going on a road trip that you’ve had weeks to plan for, and you’re car needs an oil change,  DONT TAKE IT TO GET THE OIL CHANGED THE FUCKING DAY BEFORE YOU HAVE TO LEAVE IF YOU DONT ALREADY HAVE AN APPOINTMENT. YOURE NOT THE ONLY DUMBASS DOING THE SAME THING
1957 2018-08-30 20:18:05 I just got this oil mist for my hair that smells like heaven
1958 2018-08-30 20:17:58 CBD oil has seriously helped my anxiety, it’s crazy!
1959 2018-08-30 20:17:52 International laws do not allow such provocative and hatred activities, the world is standing on the throne of the war, the international crisis will work on oil It will use by terrorists the enemy of humanity, for their fascinating purposes.

1960 2018-08-30 20:17:51 Just remembered dis name “Hair Oil”
1961 2018-08-30 20:17:34 Energy east pipeline supplying maritime provinces with Cdn oil is what should have been built. Ridiculous they import Saudi oil. The debate over a new pipeline to west coast is the wrong debate regardless of what side of the debate you're on. Send Alberta oil east to Canadians.
1962 2018-08-30 20:17:31 ...they make these demands that he ‘PUT THA ANDS IN THA POCKETS’.  It’s quite bloody clear he does that already, and I find it kind of insulting when people do it.  Would they give the money if they owned it?  He’s rich compared to average bloke, but he’s no  oil baron.
1963 2018-08-30 20:17:30 Now Playing: Okapi - Oil & filters
1964 2018-08-30 20:17:22 State of this utter twat who thinks he’s won an argument from the White Paper in 2014. Christ almighty we are being dragged out of the EU and inevitable forced into wars and this utter wank thinks oil prices are important. Grow up you utter failure. @LiddlerPup
1965 2018-08-30 20:17:21 We're in a bit of a conundrum: use oil from bad countries or ruin our enviro with our own? 
Trudeau ran on the promise he would remove o&g subsidies + put to new tech. Hasn't happened. The liberals are environmentally disappointing (among other issues)
1966 2018-08-30 20:17:20 Oil for a car? Or...?
1967 2018-08-30 20:17:18 This guy left all as a statement of NO MORE. He told the world and France at the same time. Climate Change is Real. CO2 as the cause is FAKE. No CO@ = NO LIFE ON EARTH. 
       The VOC's from OIL/GAS & the TCE used to get it, being over toxic a a Billion parts of H20 to 1 TCE
1968 2018-08-30 20:17:08 You should also realize that one of the biggest shareholders in the shipping business for oil is Warren Buffett who has also contributed to environmental groups opposing the pipeline
1969 2018-08-30 20:16:56 Oh wow, , that is good,  the horse anatomy is perfect , as is the horseman's  what did you paint it on ?  Anymore to show ?  Did you use oil or acrylic . THANK YOU for sharing !
1970 2018-08-30 20:16:54 Nothing in my statement was about climate change. I’m talking leadership and how there is none in this country. We spent $4.5 billion of our hard earned money for climate change with no plan in place to replace oil with anything. We the Canadian people aren’t Trudeau’s ATM
1971 2018-08-30 20:16:40 US Closing prices: #DOW -0.53% #NASDAQ -0.23% #Ftse100 -0.62% #GBPUSD 1.3017 #EURGBP 0.8968 #EURUSD 1.1674 #Gold 0.10% #Oil -0.21%
1972 2018-08-30 20:16:39 The ruling on tanker traffic is also a huge concern.

Don't get me wrong, protecting the whale population is fairly important.  However, if an oil tanker for export is a risk, then a cargo ship to import clothing, electronics, autos, etc. are also risks.  

Strangled economy
1973 2018-08-30 20:16:36 I wish Newman's Own would offer a salad dressing that uses 100% olive oil in it as opposed to canola or soybean oil. I am sure people would be willing to pay a higher price for it. I know i love that olive oil & Vinegar dressing more if it had 100% olive oil.
1974 2018-08-30 20:16:33 OIL YOUR PM
1975 2018-08-30 20:16:31 Almond vs almond Oil.  Sesame seed vs sesame oil.  Flaxseed vs oil.  Fresh ground better. Avocado vs avocado oil.
1976 2018-08-30 20:16:29 There's refineries in BC. Add that into the few thousand building jobs, plus all the jobs the oil industry provides, that's a lot of jobs, especially for Alberta.
1977 2018-08-30 20:16:23 Mastodon and Dinosaur Jr tour cancelled. Fuck.  

(Last Labour Day weekend it was Midnight Oil that cancelled)

What the shit?
1978 2018-08-30 20:16:21 Just filled my oil on my own :3

If you know me personally you’d know this is a big deal lol
1979 2018-08-30 20:16:14 coconut oil is the real game changer holy fuck
1980 2018-08-30 20:16:13 In fact, IMHO, the oil industry went to some effort to create some of the opposition it now faces. There is a price to pay when people with legitimate concerns are referred to as eco-terrorists.
1981 2018-08-30 20:16:08 Where are the quotas for female front line infantry, coal miners, oil riggers, welders and construction workers?
1982 2018-08-30 20:16:03 Please don't sell off our land to oil interests.  You are a criminal and not an American.

You lied about your service to our country, that should be punishable by deportation. 

You are a disgrace to all service members and the United States.
1983 2018-08-30 20:15:55 Cant believe you won! Woohoo!! Super great page for essential oil education
1984 2018-08-30 20:15:54 I didn’t realise you were into oil painting.
1985 2018-08-30 20:15:49 even black seed oil does miracles
1986 2018-08-30 20:15:45 PLEASE read the ingredients listed on your items; purchase alternatives if palm oil is listed!
1987 2018-08-30 20:15:43 My dumb self tried to close the hood of my car after topping off the oil I just changed, and I forgot I left my phone there. I was wondering why it wouldn’t close all the way the first time.. but PTL my phone didn’t even get a scratch or crack 
1988 2018-08-30 20:15:36 We Will Worship- Mmuso, Like Oil, Ungezungezile. They bless my soul...
1989 2018-08-30 20:15:36 All natives are concerned about is how much money they can leach out of oil companies and tax payers. Their interest in environmental concerns was lost years ago, just look at their lands!

1991 2018-08-30 20:15:26 @MaximeBernier if you were PM would you end all trade, including oil imports, with Saudi Arabia and expel their ambassador?
1992 2018-08-30 20:15:22 There’s nothing like a oil type family bonding time
1993 2018-08-30 20:15:18 A good salad I just had in Spain was Mango, avocado, sweet corn, cherry tomatoes with some olive oil and pepper I think. Bomb!

Also love turkey tacos. Ground turkey, then lettuce, avocado, cheese, sweet chili sauce tomatoes, sour cream. Hard shell.
1994 2018-08-30 20:15:16 Will you be slathered in coconut oil?
1995 2018-08-30 20:15:15 Experts say gas prices could rise Labor Day Weekend but drop by mid-September. The oil executives should have their cars & homes paid off by then.
1996 2018-08-30 20:15:11 I'm gonna say 8. But all you need is a rage bug and pure poison.
1997 2018-08-30 20:15:11 Yeah, I guess I wish they had just given up on the oil/right wing vote and spent money elsewhere. Maybe even on green energy!
1998 2018-08-30 20:15:10 Do you prefer oil paint, acrylic paint or airbrush?
1999 2018-08-30 20:15:03 Oh my !!!!! Well that got my motor running !!! Never mind the engine oil spillage 
2000 2018-08-30 20:15:01 Quebec is legalizing it, I have alot of health issues and I have to take CBD oil for anxiety and it's been helping me gain my weight back.. I was very under weight until I started taking it.. so happy I did and I recommend it to anyone
2001 2018-08-30 20:15:01 This is the can of oil your talking to remember
2002 2018-08-30 20:14:54 Sir we have  co2 oil
2003 2018-08-30 20:14:23 i need CBD oil
2004 2018-08-30 20:14:09 The chemical that makes things spicy is an oil canned capsaicin. As we know, oil and water don't mix, so the water just spreads the spice around. But milk is just water with fat particles in it which can stick to the oil.
2005 2018-08-30 20:14:00 Punjab food Authority Faisalabad ki negligence ki waja sa powder milk sale hu raha hay jis sa insane ka kindey ko nuksan ponch sakta hay expire oil Gunndi bhussi food item khulayi ja rahi hain Punjab food authority paisa lay kar chur deti aur mulawat mafia phir sale start kar
2006 2018-08-30 20:13:57 I actually do not give a fuck if oil went to $5 a barrel. What relevance has it got? What’s your point caller? We don’t care. 

Now answer the question. Where does the tax go?
2007 2018-08-30 20:13:56 So can't get a pipeline built east and the one to the west is stalled, lovely. But hey let's keep in bringing oil in from the middle east and continue to dump raw sewage it rivers and oceans
2008 2018-08-30 20:13:55 Then let's increase oil by rail!
2009 2018-08-30 20:13:55 This all feels like old news don't you think Deirdre. UN finally acknowledges peak oil and externalities. Where has everybody need??
2010 2018-08-30 20:13:47 *fucks up the economy during a damn oil boom*
nothing personnel, kiddo
2011 2018-08-30 20:13:44 LOL THTS IT ARE U FINISHED OH YEAH IT STOPS THERE DOESNT IT 

WHERES ur champions league where's 18 league titles like my Liverpool where 5 champions leagues I can't see any visible  facts that will make my eyes pop that city have done  oil club ur getting there but oil club stil
2012 2018-08-30 20:13:24 Much better fried un olive  oil, not butter pleaseeeeeee
2013 2018-08-30 20:13:16 just watched the director of chinese association in venezuela on TV and they said they will comply with the recent economic measures of venezuelan government... this coming from chinese owners of shops and stores. But the real deal is oil between china and venezuela and debts..
2014 2018-08-30 20:13:13 You could say that about every project but then we will never decrease CO2 emissions! Remember the ocean is made up of drops of water. Short term greed by multinational oil companies leading to long term environmental harm.
2015 2018-08-30 20:13:05 I've been using toasted sesame oil in my cooking more recently as I really like the smell and taste of it. Got to find more things like it! I'm used to cooking oils that seem designed to change the taste of the food as little as possible, so this is pretty different to me X3
2016 2018-08-30 20:13:01 追いオリーブもいいけど、追いフォローもよろしくな。
2017 2018-08-30 20:12:59 Giglio just doesn’t like him because he doesn’t use coconut oil
2018 2018-08-30 20:12:46 a talking head said google & facebook should have civic responsibility. I never heard anyone say that re' big pharma, insurance, and oil. I agree, all companies doing business in the US should have civic responsibility. Nationalize drugs, insurance, and oil. it's the only way!
2019 2018-08-30 20:12:45 Try glitter with coconut oil
2020 2018-08-30 20:12:37 it's IGNORANT dumbass and BC doesn't have a refinery. We use Cherry Point Refinery which uses BP oil dummy. So your ignorance is showing.
2021 2018-08-30 20:12:30 They can build refineries and sell refined gasoline within Canada therefore reducing Canada's dependency of refined oil from overseas.
2022 2018-08-30 20:12:28 I used to use Kerrygold (grassfed butter) from SaveCo. Now I can’t seem to find it. I also got Brain Octane oil from Bulletproof coffee cos I had digestive issues with MCT Oil 
2023 2018-08-30 20:12:20 Yeah so now what? Stop oil all together? Pipeline are safe. And how about we use and produce our own instead of importing from Saudi and we have fucking work. Or get on it and have other energy business now! I need to work
2024 2018-08-30 20:12:15 kept tryna figure out why I smelled like the braid shop. using pink oil in a clutch cause you out of your regular shit.
2025 2018-08-30 20:12:14 Makes no difference if it’s long term or short term exposure to

2028 2018-08-30 20:11:48 focaccia or challah! omg or sourdough! it all depends on the mood and how I’m eating it. Focaccia is best for dipping in oil, challah best for grilled cheese/eating straight, and sourdough for sandwiches!
2029 2018-08-30 20:11:31 "If you ever eaten at McD's, you'd have eaten silicone (fluid) because that's what they use in their deep fryers, creates a layer on top of the oil, helps prevent oxidation so the oil lasts longer..." - @archerwolf126

And that's bulk silicone I use for my latex

2046 2018-08-30 20:09:30 I agree that it’s time to invest in other energy strategies, clean technologies, CO2 capture etc. But the truth is the world needs oil and will continue to need oil for generations to come.

2051 2018-08-30 20:09:12 We don't need Arabia's oil, are perverted religion. Why do we have to have any dealings with a country that puts such little value in women, are people that worship differently. I know they're supposed to be our friends, but do we really need this in our lives?

2061 2018-08-30 20:08:38 If human nature were the culprit - oil interest would have not needed to spend billions on skullduggery to influence voters and to buy media cooperation
2062 2018-08-30 20:08:34 Trudeau can recover here because of Donald J. Trump. Canada simply must have access to new markets for its oil (vs only USA). Not sure about Notley, but certainly not her fault. This is 100% the Feds (Harper Cons/Libs) & KM's cluster$*^@.
2063 2018-08-30 20:08:32 OMG no kidding it smells like a ripe butthole

Is yours an oil tincture? I typically make an alcohol tincture, but I think the alcohol might be affecting me badly right now. Or I got a weird strain (dumb illegal state)
2064 2018-08-30 20:08:20 I relate but honestly tea tree oil and clay masks clear that shit real quick

2066 2018-08-30 20:08:03 If you can define slowly phased out please do. Investment in the oil and gas industry around the world, minus Canada, has grown exponentially in the last few years. The demand for oil is increasing and is going to continue to increase for the next few hundred years.

2068 2018-08-30 20:07:55 (2)go read the Pulitzer Prize winning novel “Guns, Germs and Steel”. It takes generations for full implementation of new technology...we need a strong economy with excess capital to invest in clean tech, and fortunately for Canada,we have the means to do so through our oil wealth

2073 2018-08-30 20:07:04 News flash Eisenstein , without oil you’re nothing . Maybe someday things will be different but not in our lifetime .
2074 2018-08-30 20:07:04 Let’s ask you who controls oil prices. Who?
2075 2018-08-30 20:07:02 @UNCLE_AJALA Fisayo can you think from our lane&stop blowing unnecessary grammar.I might lack vitamin&mineral but I know politics than you do. Minority parties with saints from heaven can't win election in  coz they can't fund their candidates, do they have oil blocs? Think!

2078 2018-08-30 20:06:53 Rinse again, then I'll actually Biore strip my nose and chin
Then spray on some thermal water cos its obviously stripped dry at this point, or even do a quick mask (eg Fresh rose hydration)
Then serum, then the Nuxe, with a drop of beauty oil (argan/watermelon/etc.)

2080 2018-08-30 20:06:49 It wasn’t just vague capitalism. It was the oil industry, misinformation, and mostly the GOP. Putin and Trump’s climate hoax?
2081 2018-08-30 20:06:48 Fun fact, I oil pull for 20 minutes ever morning and before bed, so that’s 40 minutes of gargling/swishing every day. Skills that don’t pay the bills lol.
2082 2018-08-30 20:06:29 And there is 0 people who think carbon emmisions are decreasing. Not even oil companies. Where did you get this crock of shit lol.

2097 2018-08-30 20:05:18 If we don’t make oil someone else will , simple . Climate won’t get any better cause Canada is not producing . Only our contribution to pollution will be smaller and we’re gonna be buying oil from Middle East , cause why not right? Support their economy instead ours
2098 2018-08-30 20:05:16 I just refuse to shake hands cuz most times they’re dirty with oil paint and pastel at work anyways hahahaha
2099 2018-08-30 20:04:58 It seems neither of us can answer a question. You go first. 

Has oil been anywhere near $113 p/b since Indref?
2100 2018-08-30 20:04:56 Perhaps they should have approved Energy East. Who would invest in Canada's oil industry with such buffonery.
2101 2018-08-30 20:04:46 Oh jesus jesus is involved. What are you saving the oil for? A big salad? You oiliberals are all the same.
2102 2018-08-30 20:04:40 Couldn’t find any oil. Only Lard. That’s how Yorkshire my mum is.

2112 2018-08-30 20:03:27 Who cares about the oil price? Can you tell me what difference it makes? 

Where does the tax go?
2113 2018-08-30 20:03:11 The production & delivery of oil products, natural gas & electricity in Canada contributes $170 billion to Canada's gross domestic product (GDP) just under 10%. Ocean access can provide another $29 billion - spend that on green technology, or let the US decide how to spend it.
2114 2018-08-30 20:03:11 Guess you are really ignorance. Next time please Google the existing transmountain pipeline and read its content before you commenting. Most fuel in BC comes from the transmountain. Except the current BC government would prefer US oil than Alberta.

2120 2018-08-30 20:02:34 Cook 'em in olive oil, garlic and tomatoes. Put in a curry with ground almonds and tumeric. Make chutney. Or just boil and serve with butter and salt.
2121 2018-08-30 20:02:34 I do that! Plus Lysine and fish oil with D3 and I still feel like crap
2122 2018-08-30 20:02:18 Black seed oil actually took away this weird dry cough I’ve had for a month
2123 2018-08-30 20:02:11 What's gingelly oil? 
2124 2018-08-30 20:02:02 Or better yet: build it as many indigenous groups want it and it is far FAR safer than oil by rail. Surly if Asia doesn’t buy our oil they’ll buy elsewhere. How does that benefit Canadians ? Massive tax revenues and huge economic opportunities incl jobs jobs JOBS from #KMPipeline
2125 2018-08-30 20:02:01 RT THE ALMIGHTY "MIGHT".

He's good, but he's not that good.
2130 2018-08-30 20:01:27 I just want a oil change ... and they wanna name everything else under the sun I don’t care about
2131 2018-08-30 20:01:25 You seem to be confused.

I dont claim to know more than anyone. The White Paper said $113 p/b was a conservative estimate for oil. It doesn't take an SME to know that is wrong. Very wring.
2132 2018-08-30 20:01:20 Even ignoring your lavish praise of oil, Justin Trudeau is not part of the Judicial branch of government.
2133 2018-08-30 20:01:11 We have a 30 year window to transition to 100% renewable in order to stave off an irreversible #hothouse earth. This means no expansion or continued subsidizing the oil & gas industry>In fact, we should be ensuring they pay for damages because they knew for decades & spun delays.
2134 2018-08-30 20:01:05 Motor oil?
2135 2018-08-30 20:01:04 I also wonder if they are looking for opportunities to bring it down.  It's a cause that goes against oil and other auto markets... And short sellers.  It's not a the revenue generating behemoth the board and shareholders see it as.  It is a lifelong dream and a step toward....
2136 2018-08-30 20:00:58 Apparently cbd oil is very good for md
2137 2018-08-30 20:00:57 Take all the time you need. And then stop caving in to big oil and do what the Liberals campaigned to do: be better stewards of Canada’s lands and waters than Harper was. You’ve been all talk and actions in the wrong direction.

2144 2018-08-30 20:00:16 We can’t build pipelines in our own country, but we can buy oil from Saudi Arabia. The betrayal of Canadians by the political class and the corrupt system continues to worsen. Never before has a group of ‘leaders’ done so little with so much.
2145 2018-08-30 20:00:13 Suffering while waiting on an oil change.  I don’t watch tv and I’m stuck in room with a loud one.  Kelli Pickler has a talk show and she is so annoying!  Now I get to watch the local “news”.
2146 2018-08-30 20:00:10 Delay?  Come on Omar you know full well that Trudeau said he wanted oil sands to stay in the ground. This is all part of an elaborate sceme by liberals.  Perhaps if you hacks would actually do some investigative reporting instead of coddling him you would clue in.
2147 2018-08-30 20:00:03 Someone tell me how Canada is supposed to move it’s oil without pipelines, is it all supposed to be shipped in on trucks and tankers or does it just magically appear?
2148 2018-08-30 19:59:58 Omg no way!  that's like me with a frying pan! Idk why but I just hate seeing frying pans with oil in on the side 
2149 2018-08-30 19:59:39 @realDonaldTrump All sanctions are enforced, no entity, bank, or company has the right to deal with Iran and no currency will enter Iran. No country will be exempted from the oil embargo, and Iran's oil exports will be set to zero until November 4th. Zero, zero, zero
2150 2018-08-30 19:59:36 No, they make them from the market delivered petroleum byproducts from discounted and disadvantaged Canadian oil products we sell. We should not be naive about the unfair market advantage Canada is suffering under when selling the oil we produce. Strawman arguments change little
2151 2018-08-30 19:59:11 For the greater good, to hell with the oil industry.
2152 2018-08-30 19:58:58 Fossil fuels will not disappear, more will need to be bought from countries with dispicable human rights and the dirtiest oil.

Algenist Genius melting cleanser (this is a cream cleanser, goes on DRY, turns into an oil that very gently melts off the entire gross top layer of gunk, then you splash water and it emulsifies)

2164 2018-08-30 19:57:10 Capers do not belong in slaw. Now, crisp those puppies in some olive oil,  with a lethal dose of garlic and some anchovies...add to spaghetti...top with cheese...then we can talk
2165 2018-08-30 19:57:10 This was his plan from the beginning to keep us using foreign oil, esp from his Arab pals
2166 2018-08-30 19:56:50 You know what we need more than an oil #pipeline? A #PeoplePipeline - a safe, reliable, affordable TRANSPORTATION Network in each province & across #Canada to replace #Greyhound OCT 31 ~ $2B for rail/ improvements on #Coquihalla + $2B for new fleets, drivers, tech @JustinTrudeau
2167 2018-08-30 19:56:32 No see just continuing to scream “ethical oil” is all you need to do when consulting First Nations.
2168 2018-08-30 19:56:30 WTF ? There is no oil embargo on Venezuelan production. It’s still being imported into US. Problem is production is collapsing due to poor infrastructure & starving workers. Try another excuse Einstein.
2169 2018-08-30 19:56:29 Im against the pipeline for environmental reasons however its important for the economy that it gets built. Your just hoping it fails to make it an issue in the election. Not sure why your not defending the project given your party champions Albertan oil, hypocrisy at its finest.
2170 2018-08-30 19:56:22 Egg yolk, lemon juice, vinegar, canola oil, mustard. What's not to like?
2171 2018-08-30 19:56:13 Oil pan went from Louisiana to Georgia 
2172 2018-08-30 19:56:13 3 1/2
2173 2018-08-30 19:56:12 A new line of aluminum crush gaskets for automotive oil pan drain bolts will be announced #applenews
2174 2018-08-30 19:56:12 Yes! I’ve baked them or fried them quickly in olive oil. If you need low carb there’s also those shirataki noodles (by the refrigerated tofu in the grocery store). They need a good rinse but they absorb the flavor of the sauce and it’s more like pasta than zoodles.
2175 2018-08-30 19:55:54 Oh, no! A tip for using flea comb. Have a small dish or saucer with liquid dish detergent or vegetable oil at hand. Put fleas from comb in that and they can't escape.
2176 2018-08-30 19:55:36 WHY can't balsamic vinegar be next to olive oil at the grocery store. #whitegirlproblems
2177 2018-08-30 19:55:32 Astonishing fact: Norway produced 5% less Oil & Gas than Scotland between 1964 and 2016. 
Where is our money?
Where is our Norwegian living standard?
Where is our 2018 annual Sovereign Wealth fund declaring $131.5Bn profit?
Happy being ripped off in the union?
#DissolveTheUnion
2178 2018-08-30 19:55:27 Sorry Rueben, you can't have it both ways. Your people can't overtly benefit from forestry, mining, oil pipelines and other industry and then play the heritage card. The daily spew from fishing boats are & have been a bigger a risk to the ocean than this pipeline.
2179 2018-08-30 19:55:13 Thankful for coconut oilalways rubbing it on my belly/boobs to prevent stretch marks
2180 2018-08-30 19:55:09 Oil is gasping into September, but I've followed your discussion on AOI.  It is interesting.  Oil -> gold, XLE et al -> #PRM
2181 2018-08-30 19:55:05 I took my car to get an oil change and apparently my battery was bad they’re replacing it all covered under my warranty 
2182 2018-08-30 19:55:03 The far right and western governments need to be informed that tough financial penalties will be applied to all western oil by at the very least $50USD per barrel of crude if they don't behave. It is called reciprocity and it applies legally!
2183 2018-08-30 19:54:57 Tooooh
2184 2018-08-30 19:54:55 Come on. Of course they are different,  but the way the RFS mandates interfere with the market made VEETC redundant.

And no, oil companies shouldnt get subsidies either. Difference being that there is a worldwide market for oil, whereas ethanol is the boondoggle no one asked for
2185 2018-08-30 19:54:38 American coal vs. middle east oil, the power plants are also more  efficient.
2186 2018-08-30 19:54:33 But the snake oil salesman told me that was the safest place to leave my stuff!?!
2187 2018-08-30 19:54:29 Question is... Is it a synthetic oil change @SearsAuto
2188 2018-08-30 19:54:25 But I think he was being lazy cos I’ve been going to the same ppl for my oil change and they said they are supposed to rotate the tires each time so how come only my fronts are worn on one side lol. Cars are confusing
2189 2018-08-30 19:54:24 ROTFL - No rail is FAR safer! It is NOT oil - but Bitumen that the #TransMountain was going to carry. Bitumen is sticky - it is tar. By rail, they do not dilute it with toxic chemicals. It won't burn - even if you light it with fire and it wont spill from a rail car.
2190 2018-08-30 19:54:18 when you THOUGHT you needed an oil change but you still got 2000 miles ta go
2191 2018-08-30 19:54:17 mom and grandma used to make pasta with cauliflower or pasta w/broccoli 

basically just steamed/boil the veg, mix it with plain pasta and drizzle with olive oil

can't tell you how many times i had that for dinner
2192 2018-08-30 19:54:17 Loaded up on $AOI.to for now as it looks like oil will continue to perform. 200k shs.
2193 2018-08-30 19:54:16 No - just the oil & gas industry.
2194 2018-08-30 19:54:14 "Not only did ze US undt EU only sanction Fenezuela fery r-r-recently, but most sanctions affect only [...] r-r-regime members, mitt de few economic eins hafingkt nein real effect. If ze US visched to kause serious economic harm to Fenezuela it vould stop buyingkt its oil."
2195 2018-08-30 19:53:52 Brought my mom’s car to get an oil change and oh my goshhhh all these mechanics are arguing with one another 
2196 2018-08-30 19:53:36 No, I don't. There is always - always - some reasonable-sounding step that an oil & gas project proponent missed, and that nullifies the NEB's or govt's approval. We have a long and rigorous review process already. Let's get the courts out of it.
2197 2018-08-30 19:53:35 Ughhhhh I am stuck in car dealer waiting for oil change and it's been non stop McCain and how great he was on Fox.  Can't wait to leave!
2198 2018-08-30 19:53:24 Forgot my tanning oil in the house so now I’m depressed. :(
2199 2018-08-30 19:53:17 Need to oil Mother soon. Get all the hard-to-reach places.
2200 2018-08-30 19:53:12 Please tell me which oil una dey use for cooking?

2201 2018-08-30 19:53:11 slicker than niggas, like olive oil
2202 2018-08-30 19:53:07 Well you really ought to be getting some coin from the oil industry.  If you're going to be greasy at least drive a BMW.
2203 2018-08-30 19:52:48 The Aztecs history can be summarized like this:
Tech-less Americans, who are constantly on steroids and meth, and loves going to war as much as america likes to monopolize oil.
2204 2018-08-30 19:52:43 You won my heart with this @oil_shai
2205 2018-08-30 19:52:32 stop committing school shootings, just go into the military you can kill innocents for oil
2206 2018-08-30 19:52:19 Right, no more money, special tax breaks, under-valued leases and free externalities for the oil industry.
2207 2018-08-30 19:52:16 Just brought a vape and cbd oil in the hopes to maybe relieve some chronic pain!
2208 2018-08-30 19:52:06 Indeed but @bcndp @BCGreens and many others opposes oil pipelines or #LNG or even #SiteC ..

2213 2018-08-30 19:51:13 Oil club with no damn history
2214 2018-08-30 19:51:07 All the terpenes that get you stoned are found in other plants why make them synthetically just buy the food grade terpenes online. They are cheap. People dont do this yet but i will be the first website in the world to offer recipes. THC(the clear oil)+recipe+terpenes= DIY
2215 2018-08-30 19:51:04 Ok. But how much is just normal, cyclical rally?
Inflation will not be REAL, imo, until the CPI stays above 3% all the way through a recession. 
Until then it’s just coincident w GDP and oil prices.
2216 2018-08-30 19:51:01 Less than a barrel of oil has spilled out of that pipeline and most of that was inside. They are just twinning an existing pipeline for god sakes . You'd rather have a collapse of one of the largest sectors in Canada?
2217 2018-08-30 19:50:44  Glad to hear that  (the glass or two not the oil leak/itinerary ) 
2218 2018-08-30 19:50:41 I read the article and Venezuela wasn't even mentioned. By the way Venezuela is not a socialist country as most of their economy is in private hands and their economic trouble were more because of falling oil prices than any socialist policy.
2219 2018-08-30 19:50:41 Is it refined oil?  Until BC bans gas cars in 2025 or so, gas has to be shipped to the Island by tanker.  Refined oil floats and is not unrecoverable like the sludge you cretins want to ship.
2220 2018-08-30 19:50:28 Do @Finchleytories and the fantastic, meekly pro-#Brexit Mike Freer not agree that the Lesotho marmalade trade will more than pay for our independent space programme to mine shale oil from the asteroids and deport #Windrush folk to Venus?
2221 2018-08-30 19:50:24 Oh never knew they were palm oil free, great!
2222 2018-08-30 19:50:19 Idiots
2223 2018-08-30 19:50:08 It’s simple to me just cut off all oil to bc. I also don’t understand how a judge can stop this?
2224 2018-08-30 19:50:02 if you have muscle aches and want your pain relief to include being punched in the face by the essence of a hundred tubes of toothpaste i recommend woodlock oil
2225 2018-08-30 19:49:58 Remember Wall St funded Hitler. Standard Oil helped Luftwaffe fly. Bush family helped launder Nazi money. Swiss stored Nazi gold. Etc.
2226 2018-08-30 19:49:58 i do oil cleanse/exfoliation/essence/face mask/eye cream/moisturizer!!!!
2227 2018-08-30 19:49:55 Are you aware of why Nigeria does not have tariff free or reduced tariffs to the EU unlike other African countries? Part of the reason is that Nigeria is oil rich so does not qualify for EBA. The second reason is it hasn't signed the deal for reduced tariffs the EU offered.
2228 2018-08-30 19:49:24 It's because of CBD oil I'm alive today. Without it I would have taken my own life.
Around 2 weeks after I started on the oil, my depression was gone. It also helps on my ADHD, when I'm on the oil.
2229 2018-08-30 19:49:22 Finally, after 41 years, I understand what a "Protocol" droid was really designed for.  Fuck off C-3PO, and take your "oil bath" with you.  
2230 2018-08-30 19:49:17 石油だってオリーブオイルだって牛脂だって仲間さ、そうだろう?
2231 2018-08-30 19:49:15 No. The residents of Lac-Mégantic will tell you that routing this train of flammable oil through their town is just as stupid as hauling even more, 650 000 barrels of toxic, flammable sludge by oil tanker through one of North America’s most densely populated cities. #StopKM
2232 2018-08-30 19:49:06 oil needs changing but ion wana pay for it 
2233 2018-08-30 19:49:02 Want to make money (and save the planet) ?  Invest in renewable energy, instead of Big Oil Greed.
2234 2018-08-30 19:49:00 The far right and western governments need to be informed that tough financial penalties will be applied to all western oil by at the very least $50USD per barrel of crude if they don't behave. It is called reciprocity and it applies legally!
2235 2018-08-30 19:48:57 Et face a un ennemi determine on ne negocie pas, on ne collabore pas, ou alors avec la ferme intention d'organiser un sabotage.
L'industrialisation et la division a outrance des taches ne meneront qu' a l'irresponsabilite, le gregarisme et l'effondrement.
2236 2018-08-30 19:48:56 Stefano is currently sorting out a van oil leak and I’m typing up a travel itinerary on the laptop, how romantic!  But we’ve made a bit of time for a glass or two nonetheless!
2237 2018-08-30 19:48:49 No, not ethically-oily enough. That he hasn't championed CA oil in general. Fair point but not sure it would have changed the opposition. Just like Notley's social license idea, you just appease the enviro and indigenous groups.
2238 2018-08-30 19:48:40 Preston bought me a new vape today, my bio oil came in the mail, we might be moving in September. LIFE IS GOOD
2239 2018-08-30 19:48:39 Voting blue for 1st amendment freedom is like trying to breath oxygen through oil
2240 2018-08-30 19:48:29 Only mad people will keep supporting lifeless person, to be an animal is better than to be lifeless. If Trump did not called Buhari lifeless why Buhari him self claimed that because I refused to give American oil that is why he called him lifeless. ( vanguard newspaper) LIFELESS.
2241 2018-08-30 19:48:25 I work for a really small business whose source of income mostly comes from the oil and gas industry. It is a rollercoaster ride. There are good months and bad months. If the pipeline was to be built it would not only help the small business I work for but other small businesses.
2242 2018-08-30 19:48:22 They find oil first, then use guns and bombs.

2245 2018-08-30 19:47:45 The only pipeline that'll get built is the one that carries oil to the US.
2246 2018-08-30 19:47:27 Lots of people live without oil (see: Africa). You can too. What’s really happening is you want to appear virtuous by crusading against oil, while not depriving yourself of its benefits. That’s the definition of a hypocrite.
2247 2018-08-30 19:47:26 We need to refine our own oil then export more jobs and more money exporting crude to other countries to refine doesn't make sense then we buy back finished product
2248 2018-08-30 19:47:18 How can one man hold Canada’s oil patch ransom? This needs to be dealt with.
2249 2018-08-30 19:47:07 Why? Did Affleck ruin extra virgin olive oil too?

2253 2018-08-30 19:46:39 Hi Shooters! Actually, Medicare costs only 3% overhead. And the private sector spends money on advertising and marketing, dividends for stockholders, and profit for CEO's. Shooters, we even pay subsidies to the tobacco and oil industries.
2254 2018-08-30 19:46:38 the government could build a refinery to refine the oil to lower prices for Canadian's

2262 2018-08-30 19:46:19 So, Banana land Canada has yet again avoided dealing with harsh reality, and has given in totally to Donald Trump, who really doesn't want Canada to export oil, he wants it in America, and he will get our oil, cheaply too..part of "Making America Great Again" havn't you all heard
2263 2018-08-30 19:46:15 Trudeau and Harper are two sides of the same crooked coin. It's time for the Liberal party and the Conservatives to go away. They still operate like we're living in 1920. As for your claim about the tar sands oil being clean, are you on the crack?
2264 2018-08-30 19:46:06 Head and shoulders shampoo contains palm oil under various disguises please boycott proctor and gamble products
2265 2018-08-30 19:46:06 Why do you need a loan if you have so much cash.

In 2008 the oil price was 130 dollars. Please sir....stop talking shit. If you cannot, at 130 dollars pay off 5 times your debt you have a problem,irrespective if the Christians, the Colonists,  the Chinese or WB caused it.

2276 2018-08-30 19:45:20 Maybe he thinks it’s cooking oil being sent through the pipeline
2277 2018-08-30 19:45:18 Umm. No it didn’t. It simply stated that they failed to include tanker traffic in their assesment. Didn’t mention the environmental impact of oil extraction AT ALL. Stop making sh*t up!!
2278 2018-08-30 19:45:13 Don't let zephy get red and gold potatoes, yellow onion, cayenne chilis, pork chops, eggs, and olive oil.

2279 2018-08-30 19:45:12 Damaged on 9/11 and his business were not affected. Russia again profiting on oil prices skyrocketing and the US economy destabilizing. They blame us and the UK for the collapse. They wanted bre-exit!! They want to dominate again!! They will destroy us because of this...
2280 2018-08-30 19:45:12 Today's Trans Mountain ruling makes a good day for Canada because it's a bad day for the oil sands, and for Trudeau's strategy of keeping Harper's energy policy with new PR
2281 2018-08-30 19:45:06 I can do everything to a car,change a tyre,oil, jump start,push start, you name it. I saw it so many times from Mom and bro. 

But I just can't drive(properly). 


2282 2018-08-30 19:45:05 The GOP has privatized profit and socialized loss. Cut federal employee salaries? Taxpayer walls to protect Big Oil from climate change they deny exists? Cut healthcare, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security? #BetterOffNow is a slogan for the top 1%.
2283 2018-08-30 19:45:04 KM is the only oil pipline to tidewater from Canada,which now is working to full capacity,and as long as it is maintained will be profitable for a long time.maybre we should rebuild it with looping for the future,bypassing the new pipline connotation.
2284 2018-08-30 19:44:38 Texas is so big that i have to get an oil change about every month or so
2285 2018-08-30 19:44:35 Oil change time..gotta keep my baby running smooth
2286 2018-08-30 19:44:34 @ryanjespersen Oil is Cda's BIGGEST $ generator. Morneau claims Libs inherited the bungled pipeline from PC's. Libs lied 2 Cdns about their budgets-you think they would have treated the oil money generator with logic & common sense. Bottom line JT hates oil & disregards defecits
2287 2018-08-30 19:44:31 Sure, forest management will help. Selective cutting is great. Clear cutting, slash piles, and chocked out high density regrowth doesn't. How about addressing the cause... Climate Change? How about alternative energy instead of pipelines? Leave the oil/coal in the ground.
2288 2018-08-30 19:44:30 Damn I thought Sally’s would’ve had black castor oil. They don’t.

Engineers in Oil and Gas
Marketing 
IT  

But I mean, these people are ages between 22 and 28 and making 6 figures.
2293 2018-08-30 19:43:51 @ElizabethMay only wat Trudeau can turn this into a win is to build a refinery to use the oil to reduce prices for Canadian's
2294 2018-08-30 19:43:45 Do you honestly think if Canada were scrap oil completely that we would even have options to sustain our livelihood? Japan, China, Russia, the Middle East Countries, the USA will not stop producing oil leaving the Canadian economy so far back behind the other developed countries.
2295 2018-08-30 19:43:44 I made this for lunch.   cherry tomatoes cut in half, green peppers sliced up, onion sliced,  cooked in olive oil and some rosemarry.  it was yummy.  now waiting to take my blood sugar, won't be surprised if it spikes.  but no carbs or sugar.
2296 2018-08-30 19:43:43 I guess building pipe lines through Alaska or spilling oil into the gulf of Mexico is OK for the environment as well.... Its going to be wonderful when our Grandchildren have no natural resources because of greedy crack pots like you!
2297 2018-08-30 19:43:41 .@WorldOil and Gulf Energy Information recently announced the finalists in the 2018 World Oil Awards, with the winners to be named at a black-tie gala on Thursday, October 11 at The Houstonian Hotel in Houston.
2298 2018-08-30 19:43:36 They repossess the collateral: oil.
2299 2018-08-30 19:43:32 Bro just reminding you to get your oil changed
2300 2018-08-30 19:43:31 Advice to new employees.
DONT EAT OIL DOWN
When lunch time, you won't wanna work after lunch lol
2301 2018-08-30 19:43:23 Gun oil and wet platinum are my default silicone based lubes. Swiss navy and astroglide for my toys
2302 2018-08-30 19:43:19 If it cost another billion who cares. We need this for Canada. This is bigger than what party u belong too. We need this to get oil to the west coast (ESt coast as well). Plus this was started by Harper or hv u forgotten?
2303 2018-08-30 19:43:06 The Russians are responsible for 9/11 as well as the Saudis!! The world is afraid because they control the oil!! There is a video of the Russians, Saudis along with trump in 2000 talking about business...then 9/11 and Russia recovers!! Trump gets money allocated for business
2304 2018-08-30 19:42:57 what planet are you on? ethical oil....
#clown
2305 2018-08-30 19:42:55 Mix up about 1/4 cup of olive oil (vegetable oil will work too), and some seasonings. I usually use oregano, basil, red pepper flakes, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, and some creole seasoning. Rub the tenderloin down with it, let it sit for 30 mins or so...
2306 2018-08-30 19:42:46 Elon Musk = best bond villain ever. Billionaire industrialist? Check. Tunneling under California? Check. Building rockets to go into space? Check. Undermining global oil using disruptive tech (sympathetic characteristic)? Check. Flawed personality? Check.
2307 2018-08-30 19:42:40 In my newbie-gay days, it legit had a burning sensation when I tried to use it with condoms.

So thankful for the internet, because I graduated to Gun Oil H2O all the way back when I was in college. LOL
2308 2018-08-30 19:42:40 I recommend CBDBros purple paste, if you can save up. It's not hugely expensive, much more cost effective than the oil as a little goes a long way. I also use fiddlers elbow grease hemp balm which is good too.
2309 2018-08-30 19:42:35 Lol all the people at plants make fun of me because I’m weak and smole BUT who is the only one who can fit between equipment without getting dirty? Me. Have fun with that oil on your shirt dude. 
2310 2018-08-30 19:42:18 @EdKrassen you all they own all the gold and other commoditys they own all the petroleum industry refineries they own all the gas and oil they own all the banks in America and in European union  they own all the central banks in the world except for 3 country's russia Iran and
2311 2018-08-30 19:42:17 sure, but fact is Oil use in world is going up every day. Yes, AB should find other alternative, and they have started to, but that doesn't mean country shouldn't have this. It is ridiculous Canada buys $33B of oil outside our country because we don't transfer Oil from W to E.
2312 2018-08-30 19:41:59 ปวดมือออออ การบ้านยังไม่เสร็จ
2313 2018-08-30 19:41:53 The Truth, I voted for Palin... Reason: how she handed big oil $$ back to the People....
2314 2018-08-30 19:41:52 I just bought a cool new Alienware PC  Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
2315 2018-08-30 19:41:51 A well oiled machine needs oil.
2316 2018-08-30 19:41:48 Dude, I know you’re clearly high AF and creative writing is your stoner jam but no one is buying your bullshit “clean oil” rant. Simmer down
2317 2018-08-30 19:41:36 原油70ドル乗せたね
Oil extends August climb, with U.S. crude benchmark prices topping $70 a barrel/MarketWatch
2318 2018-08-30 19:41:26 Lets pursue energy east and not any ship oil to BC. BC thinks shipping by rail car is SO much safer
2319 2018-08-30 19:41:19 Not if we go blue and let Robert Frances be our senator they will regulate the oil industry out of business.
2320 2018-08-30 19:41:16 おつかれたま♡
2321 2018-08-30 19:41:02 I swear a lot. Worked construction and the Oil Patch. Got a 12th degree black belt and a PhD in profanity. My kids learned to swear before kindergarden. Is what it is. Pleasure to tweet you...
2322 2018-08-30 19:40:45 Riddle me this: why does the anticipation of a camel farting in the Middle East cause oil prices to go crazy, but a crazy POTUS threatening nuclear conflict doesn't make a ripple?
2323 2018-08-30 19:40:43 My son. Environmentalist. Won't eat meat, nothing with palm oil. Won't drink bottled water.
2324 2018-08-30 19:40:36 you're making yourself look bad, BC oil doesn't come from Alberta it comes from the Alaskan Slope and then is refined in Washington.
2325 2018-08-30 19:40:33 あの時のBBの言葉はスッゲー嬉しかったなー…
2326 2018-08-30 19:40:32 They don’t want Alberta oil , don’t give it to them this winter . Nothing goes west of Alberta !
2327 2018-08-30 19:40:26 Talk about destroying an economy! This puke is a braindead Marxist snake oil salesman and anyone, who falls for his thievery is a complete Braindead lemming!
2328 2018-08-30 19:40:26 Snake oil.
2329 2018-08-30 19:40:13 What ... you don't change the changeable parts.. like air filters, oil filters, and brakes every now and then ?.. My car runs smooth, the White House appears to be run as smoothly as it needs to be.
2330 2018-08-30 19:40:13 世界一サラダ油だと言ってくれ。
2331 2018-08-30 19:40:13 It's necessary to have an oil diffuser and salt lamp in every room yes.
2332 2018-08-30 19:40:08 I’m currently at a 10 minute oil change thing and you don’t even had to get out of your car during it this is peak luxury
2333 2018-08-30 19:40:05 Put wood in oil
2334 2018-08-30 19:40:04 Gurl use BIO OIL!
2335 2018-08-30 19:39:52 +++
2336 2018-08-30 19:39:26 I wish you would expose the Russians involvement with the Saudis on 9/11, so they could jack up the price of oil and become bigger after the USSR collapse!!
2337 2018-08-30 19:39:16 Wtf oil is not the cleanest most environmentally-friendly energy in the world. It's one of the dirtiest especially oil from the oil sands
2338 2018-08-30 19:39:08 @BMW_UK can you please advise me on who to have my BMW X5 automatic gearbox oil and filter changed with in the south Yorkshire area because @SytnerBMW in Sheffield told me they don’t do it which I was shocked at.
2339 2018-08-30 19:39:02 This Jamaican Black Castor oil smells so horrible .
2340 2018-08-30 19:38:28 Don’t know how a kid with no artistic skills like me is gonna pass this oil painting class 
2341 2018-08-30 19:38:08 Hey! So personal property is the things you own i.e. house, car, dog, clothes, phone.
Private property refers to the means of production, or capital i.e. factory, oil drill, windmill. 
Basically without pvt. prop. We are eliminating the means to exploit and oppress workers!
2342 2018-08-30 19:37:59 I miss the way the smell of oil and the woods mix
2343 2018-08-30 19:37:52 Upset stomach or headache? Peppermint oil.
2344 2018-08-30 19:37:51 Weakness in Dow and hansang futures on fresh fears gap down expected , currency may get weak so it sector may provide support . Oil (1/2)
2345 2018-08-30 19:37:51 Lena & Belas !!!!! So sorry I've been busy, but I most certainly DREAM of a Time We Could All Three Get Naked WITH LOTS O' BABY OIL !!!!!  Sweet, Sweet Ladies, Oil & All Our Cum would Go Together SO Beautifully !!!!!  I Want Your Hard Pretty Clitties and Every Drop of Your CREME
2346 2018-08-30 19:37:39 About time no amount of coulture can mask the devastating impact of the oil industry to the environment 
there are industies that focuses on a clean earth and the health of the people art carries everything most artists dont know how much power they have so does the world
2347 2018-08-30 19:37:37 Honestly THE best of the best 
Doesn’t contain too much oil as well
2348 2018-08-30 19:37:34 Canabis oil no se consigue en todos los países, es carísimo y con prescripción médica, conozco a alguien de 36 años con mentalidad de 4 años de tantas convulciones quebha sufrido, muy triste!!
2349 2018-08-30 19:37:28 Not sure I follow. Said I would stick to those with light oil. The WCS/WTI differential is at roughly $24.
2350 2018-08-30 19:37:20 Perhaps he can explain how getting more Liberian-registered tankers carrying Saudi crude into the Salish Sea and more oil-by-rail trains running alongside the salmon streams will protect the endangered orcas
2351 2018-08-30 19:37:00 The US is getting a $32 break per barrel for our oil. They don’t wanna pay full price and they won’t!! So we Canadian pushovers will continue to take it in the you know where. We need leaders in Edm and Ottawa, next May & Sept can’t come soon enough.
2352 2018-08-30 19:36:51 No squirrel oil references?
2353 2018-08-30 19:36:48 It's like striking oil w/ this guys channel
2354 2018-08-30 19:36:46 Statoil Norway is 70% govt owned with gov unions owning a chunk too.
Greens forced them to dump their Can. oil sands projects with a large loss. Statoil is huge in the windmill biz.  We in Ontario know how that works.
2355 2018-08-30 19:36:45 Y'all get on here advocating for Gun Oil and my experience with that lube has always been subpar. The bottle design is AWFUL. I HATE the little pump mechanism... It doesn't last as long. Bottle is smaller... Just a failure all around.
2356 2018-08-30 19:36:35 Je pense que malheureusement, sauf tout le respect que je dois a sa majeste Jancovici, Hulot a raison. C'est vraiment foutu et c'est vraiment tres grave. Depuis que je suis installé, je vois tout secher, tout crever. La fin de l'holocene c'est la fin de l'agriculture. Point barre
2357 2018-08-30 19:36:20 I have no political allegiance, however this situation is simply unforgivable. 

4.5 billion dollars of taxpayers money used to buy a pipeline that doesn't exist, can't be built and will never see a drop of oil.

The architects of this total cluster should be fired, all of them.
2358 2018-08-30 19:36:19 Yo so this magic oil company followed me and now healthy accounts are following me 
2359 2018-08-30 19:36:13  get you down beard oil! I heard it works!
2360 2018-08-30 19:36:10 The world is using 100,000,000 bbls of oil per day. So we should be the only country not benefiting.
2361 2018-08-30 19:36:04 Love how you called a top in oil some time back with these garbage trendlines of yours
2362 2018-08-30 19:35:48 WEST COAst 2019 relax is oil moNEY
2363 2018-08-30 19:35:47 So the new exposure heard its hella baby oil or sumn sumby fill me in
2364 2018-08-30 19:35:38 No new customers. 

FYI the VLCCS will be their preferred way to purchase oil because shipping costs are 1/4 as much for 4 times the oil. Smaller tankers are being replaced faster than anyone expected.
2365 2018-08-30 19:35:32 U.S. oil major ExxonMobil made its 9th discovery offshore Guyana at the Hammerhead-1 well today, just two months after the company made its 8th discovery.
2366 2018-08-30 19:35:21 Meanwhile the rest of the oil producing world gets rich and laughs at the Canadian idiots blabbing away about filthy green energy.
2367 2018-08-30 19:35:07 You don't get my POINT!  Even if Alberta separated it is still LANDLOCKED meaning the OIL still does not go WEST or EAST for that matter! DUH! PS: The word LANDLOCKED is ONE word when talking about a COUNTRY that you wish you had!
2368 2018-08-30 19:34:58 It isn’t dead, tho stakeholders are selling the shares. Oil isn’t dead yet idk what everyone so excited about today. Useless.
2369 2018-08-30 19:34:55 Capatritri had a class action suit a cpl yrs ago for selling blended oil as extra virgin olive oil.  I bet guys were wondering why shots of that weren't producing the desired effect lol.
2370 2018-08-30 19:34:48 Not really, we now own a functioning pipeline that we can’t expend and will have little opportunity to sell. Perhaps we can convert the oil sands to dairy farms and make back all the lost oil and gas revenues by selling Canadians over priced milk and cheese.
2371 2018-08-30 19:34:43 Is OK bebe I have this morning ritual that includes the albuterol/ventolin, claritin, nasal spray and a steam shower w eucalyptus oil! So usually it goes away after an hour or so. Got that air filter too. But also california is actually burning down and the air quality is horrid!
2372 2018-08-30 19:34:36 These people should be fucking rich man. You’re taking their oil
2373 2018-08-30 19:34:29 Oil, vinegar and lemon juice is the only salad dressing. All other “dressings” are disgusting.
2374 2018-08-30 19:34:21 vape oil. Please I must see
2375 2018-08-30 19:34:10 With WCS/WTI differential continuing to widen I will continue to hold on to the stronger Canadian names and focus on those with light oil exposure. Also with LNG Canada's disappointment today, not even remotely ready to touch any NatGas companies here, especially AECO dependent.
2376 2018-08-30 19:34:07 You have no honor, no integrity, no class or dignity. You are the epitome of a snake oil salesman. You are the worst this country has to offer. You make everything you touch worse. You are going to be remembered as the worst President we ever had. How’s that feel little man?
2377 2018-08-30 19:34:07 Like Ontario did. Oil isn't going away any time soon.
2378 2018-08-30 19:34:05 Who needs ket when you’ve got olbas oil
2379 2018-08-30 19:33:52 I know what you mean! I did a (draft of) a painting in oil last night and was frankly THRILLED to be able to scrape things with a fingernail or smudge things with my finger, use a Q-tip or anything that I felt like doing. It's just plain way more fun that way.

2381 2018-08-30 19:33:34 According to KGOU he took 83k in donations from oil and gas interests.  (Before the primary) ~500k taken in for the crowded GOP field. He donates a lot from his own wealth.  It can never be stressed enough that his business was considered by Business Insider as a top 15 shadiest.
2382 2018-08-30 19:33:31 In existing oil fields, yes. Sad thing is, new sites are opened (by my country for example) that expect to keep on pumping for 30, 40, 50 years more. The cruel irony is that the global warming caused by oil burning is heating the Arctic which allows yet more fields to be opened.
2383 2018-08-30 19:33:31 What oil cash?
The system that screwed up things was that when oil price was high and bourgeoning middle class on a high - WB and her corporatocracy Inc. entered Venezuela. Huge loans were dished out and when oil price plummeted Ven was in trouble.
Chávez and Socialism came after
2384 2018-08-30 19:33:19 The LA Times review compared it to The Joy of Painting, if the oil landscape paintings were the worried looks of onlookers and Bob Ross was just a man gently weeping while curled up on the floor for an hour.

Overall, 4 stars.
2385 2018-08-30 19:33:12 #Graze's fries are made from fresh cut Kennebec potatoes, twice-fried Belgian-style in Non-GMO rice bran oil and seasoned with kosher salt. #Tucson
2386 2018-08-30 19:33:02 They don’t make the medical devices at the oil sands plants.
2387 2018-08-30 19:32:57 Understand that, energy east should happen so the east coast doesn’t need to import oil
2388 2018-08-30 19:32:54 Ready oil pump hnd blade..
2389 2018-08-30 19:32:45 Commitment to Niger Delta my foot!  Am sure  you actually mean his commitment for oil exploration
2390 2018-08-30 19:32:44 Dude yeah no thanks! Poor Marina ate a sandwich someone gave her and it had weed oil in it and possibly something else so I don’t trust no one lol 
2391 2018-08-30 19:32:35 Man I am so psyched that I went to do an oil change and that's all I did! 
2392 2018-08-30 19:32:31 DENHAM COURT: Exercise care at the Brooks Rd on ramp to Hume Mwy due to an oil spill. Allow extra time.
2393 2018-08-30 19:32:28 Ethical arguments based on human life are generally pretty easy to make. Let's see.. ok, if oil was cut off from Canada today 2 months from now every Canadian would be dead. The major centers 3 days in would make the hunger games look tame. So, there you go. Oil is ethical.
2394 2018-08-30 19:32:14 In truth he bought an existing pipeline that is currently moving oil, profitably.
2395 2018-08-30 19:32:06 The oil rig episode is quite amazing. I have a weakness for loop episodes but it’s hard to do something new with them. This one is managing. #CloakAndDagger
2396 2018-08-30 19:32:04 How? By destroying our oil industry.
2397 2018-08-30 19:32:02 .@loas_la the conditions you outline are real, but the problem isn't the fate of the oil industry but political inaction. The people who are keeping you poor will love your comments because they understand the true source of inequality which about debt, tax and subsidies.
2398 2018-08-30 19:31:37 He need a oil change
2399 2018-08-30 19:31:33 Because of its location - I think it would be wise to verify if oil leakage has an effect on the red tide.
2400 2018-08-30 19:31:32 なんでいきてるの？
2401 2018-08-30 19:31:19 I hurt my back in a dirt bike accident last year does that oil really help ease pain been reading up on it thinking of trying it nothing to loose out on really lol
2402 2018-08-30 19:31:08 For this reason it is recommended to always cover the baking molds and for biscuits with baking paper and oil the hands or sprinkle them with flour to work the dough. When working with broken dough, it is best to roll the dough between two layers of baking paper.

2404 2018-08-30 19:31:03 Take care of continuous lingering crisis between the host community and oil coys. The presidency jettisoned the bill just because an aspect of it allows an agency under it to have more resources than earlier allocated. It can't always be a win-win at all times. Win some lose some
2405 2018-08-30 19:30:59 The U.S. has spent over $14 trillion fighting wars over the last 30 years, while 1 in 5 Children are food insecure, over 40 million people don’t have healthcare, and our roads and bridges are literally falling apart.

The government is essentially an oil company with a military
2406 2018-08-30 19:30:34 The only drugstore foundation that I’ve had any success with is the Maybelline Fit Me line. I use the “Matte and Poreless” line because I have oily/combo skin, but they also has a line that is for a more “natural” finish if you don’t have a problem with oil.
2407 2018-08-30 19:30:33 Will everyone walk to the voting place because if you take a car you will need that oil
2408 2018-08-30 19:30:31 Refresh my Memory Charles.....What drives oil company profits in the FANG Stock USA market where if there are 100K chips per every Man/Woman/Child NO ONES CONCERNED?? Look at volumes, even on better ADV/Dec days FANGS up $20...Other stocks .03-.10 cents?? @cvpayne

2412 2018-08-30 19:30:08 Is he smoking meth oil or something
2413 2018-08-30 19:30:01 Taking Moonwalker errr..PYT..errr..hell idk to get an oil change for the first time. Can't believe I've had this car for 3 months and ain't settled on a name for it yet 
2414 2018-08-30 19:29:58 umm so i got my oil changed and one of these niggas DEFINITELY stole my doobie that was in my cup holder. lowkey my fault for havin some gas but really?! lol
2415 2018-08-30 19:29:57 The oil and gas industries, lizard people, and the russian mob aren't out to get Apple and Amazon, like they are with the super genius Musk, tho!
2416 2018-08-30 19:29:56 Wrong, 1 existing pipeline carry refined fuel and crude to Burnaby. 2 environmental impact of exporting 1 barrel of oil from Canada to pacific rim is smaller than same oil travel from Middle East. If demand shrinks, then export will shrink as well.
2417 2018-08-30 19:29:55 $SSOF focuses on supplying the oil industry with custom drilling rigs, heavy-weight drill pipe, drill collars, pup joints, pony collars, handling tools, tubing, casing, blow-out preventers, engines, compressors and other select equipment to customers world-wide
2418 2018-08-30 19:29:53 Hahaha the dutchess would clip u about never mind a 16 year old...and listen to the kays catalogue model ffs ur no oil painting urself with or without the roids 
2419 2018-08-30 19:29:49 I hated beets as a kid b/c my dad only liked pickled beets, so that's all we got. Now I loved them. Roasted with olive oil, rosemary, salt & pepper or grated raw into a salad aren't faves.
2420 2018-08-30 19:29:48 Actually they are hurting it, how mu h energy will be used to move that oil by truck and trains?
2421 2018-08-30 19:29:09 How does putting the oil into trucks and trains verses a pipe help the environment?
2422 2018-08-30 19:29:08 Oil is cyclical so you need to be in for the long haul.
2423 2018-08-30 19:29:05 All I wanted to do today was wire wrap and nap but instead I’m stuck at my dad’s empty house waiting on my car to be finished getting an oil change.
2424 2018-08-30 19:28:45 The U.S. has spent over $14 trillion fighting wars over the last 30 years, while 1 in 5 Children are food insecure, over 40 million people don’t have healthcare, and our roads and bridges are literally falling apart.

The government is essentially an oil company with a military
2425 2018-08-30 19:28:39 I painted for the first time in months today and I feel happy. I also forgot how much I love oil pastels
2426 2018-08-30 19:28:10 While oil is a big part of our economy there are many other industries thriving in Texas. Local manufacturers, professional services firms, food and beverage distribution, medical, technology, just to name a few
2427 2018-08-30 19:28:07 No one is blocking a pipeline that’s already there.

It’s about blocking oil tankers loading up at the end of the pipe for the sole purpose of shipping oil to Asia.
2428 2018-08-30 19:27:55 Yes, making sure ethically produced palm oil is on product labels would help customers to choose wisely. It would be even better if companies only sourced palm oil that is ethically produced.
2429 2018-08-30 19:27:53 Oil down 
2430 2018-08-30 19:27:51 Kenya has oil now, I'm a worried man.
2431 2018-08-30 19:27:51 You can get it at most supermarkets, but we got this pack from @waitrose I just coated it in a tikka sauce and heated it through in a hot pan with a splash of vegetable oil x
2432 2018-08-30 19:27:40 at the club drinking greek olive oil from a tin can
2433 2018-08-30 19:27:39 I think she needs to talk with the Saudis again. Looks like her joints need some oil in them.
2434 2018-08-30 19:27:38 While we are at it, can we cut the “energy” BS? They use the word because it polls better than “oil”. Hydro, solar, wind are also energy.
2435 2018-08-30 19:27:33 Fam.. me too  but on the real , i hate that Olive Oil girl. I blocked her lol
2436 2018-08-30 19:27:25 @UmActuallyShow um actually vegetable oil can be solid at room temperature if it's hydrogenated
2437 2018-08-30 19:27:20 Gun Oil is just....hyped up. I've used it many times and it dries up faster than any lube I've used. Even faster than the water based one I like!
2438 2018-08-30 19:27:18 Want to diminish stretch marks? Use Vitamin E oil and Cocoa butter. You can find both at your local drug store. Use DAILY.
2439 2018-08-30 19:27:16 @AudiUK @jardinemotorsuk £252 for an oil change. Let's just say, I will never be using you again. Snotty customer service person, "nothing we can do about that". I assumed my car asking for "oil service and inspection" would reset the service computer. No, that was another £379!!
2440 2018-08-30 19:27:15 I hate when I go for an oil change and the shop takes it upon themselves to inspect the car and have the audacity to give me a ridiculous quote for things I didn’t even ask for. Change my oil and quote me for that. 
2441 2018-08-30 19:26:54 CBD oil for me
2442 2018-08-30 19:26:42 Imagine how far ahead we'd be if #Canada had been investing in #Sustainable Energy for the last 10-20 years .. We could have been #World #Leaders in clean renewable #Energy Instead we have gone down a hole BIG hole called #Tarsands #Dirtiest OIL on earth #cdnpoli #stopthemadness
2443 2018-08-30 19:26:42 Brushes for sure, there’s no way I’m letting coconut oil sit on my face 
2444 2018-08-30 19:26:38 That's the point of a runway. Enterprise sites are like oil tankers. They take an extremely long time to turn. GB is the equiv of not just turning 180, but engineering one to fly while in the middle of the ocean.
2445 2018-08-30 19:26:04 Who took their wealth? Diamond, oil, cobalt ... etc , of course the white monkey man.
2446 2018-08-30 19:26:00 Put someone in charge who can put their massive oil reserves to good use and improve life for everyone.
2447 2018-08-30 19:25:43 Burning the midnight oil early today
2448 2018-08-30 19:25:40 Y’all remember when Dwight said he was shunned from ages 4-6 cuz he didn’t save the excess oil from a can of tuna?  #TheOffice
2449 2018-08-30 19:25:33 Michigan's water being poison is a tale as old as time. Everything along the Kalamazoo River has been toxic since my mother was a child. A corporately denied oil spill 2 miles from my family's well was a large factor in my grandmother's death.

2451 2018-08-30 19:25:26 Idol not oil
2452 2018-08-30 19:25:26 Oh. One other thing. If you guys ever have kids, and one of them, when he's eight years old, accidentally spills a pot of Nuln Oil on the living room rug... go easy on him.
2453 2018-08-30 19:25:21 A lot of questions to be asked on the thread because the PIAB not PIGB is the section of the PIB that addressed allocation of oil blocks. I am curious on the details to NASS. It will give the full picture. @Dolarpo @abelakeni
2454 2018-08-30 19:25:13 Junior planned this one superbly. He is off the hook now from both sides. Remember oil sands should stay in the ground according to Trudeau. Now he gets his way.
2455 2018-08-30 19:25:09 Think I’m high on olbas oil rn

2460 2018-08-30 19:24:45 Good fries need to be blanched and frozen before a final fry - at least. Fresh cut, single-cooked fries are no good. Also, they cook their fries in veg oil, not beef #tallow as is proper. Tbf, most burger joints stopped using tallow in the 90s. Fries haven’t been as good since.
2461 2018-08-30 19:24:37 The choices were buy it and keep the project alive, or allow Kinder Morgan to walk away. KM walking would eliminate the best chance of getting AB oil to the coast. I take it you prefer that KM abandoned the project. OK. Got it now.

2464 2018-08-30 19:24:33 Dear @blmnv,
It's really a punk-ass move to a.) only give the public 15 days to comment on the EA for the largest oil and gas lease sale in NV's recent history (425,000 acres) when the standard is 30, & b.) time it so the 15 days include two weekends plus Labor Day. (1/)
2465 2018-08-30 19:24:31 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
2466 2018-08-30 19:24:28 You know what this will do? Take a kid who's about to graduate from college in engineering. They can work for NASA or for an oil company. They see headlines like this and wonder why they should work for the government. This will just take away talent from important industries.

2469 2018-08-30 19:24:11 Yes, but If you hit Montana and hang a hard right, the Pacific is still there. Confederation is seriously broken when importing Saudi oil is more acceptable than finding a way to use Canadian oil. Alberta needs to explore exiting this farce of confederation. @jkenney

Magnificence killed for greed and stupidity.
Heartbreaking.
2474 2018-08-30 19:23:05 You point is about neoliberalism, not tar sands pipelines. Clean energy will come from a move away from oil, equality requires a more active democracy and the redistribution of wealth.
2475 2018-08-30 19:23:01 The Canadian oil and gas Industry is the best in the world at “preserving the biosphere” and not all indigenous people agree with this decision
2476 2018-08-30 19:22:56 Stop. No one wants to be using oil in 2040. We want to be done with in by 2025. Get with the program.
2477 2018-08-30 19:22:42 Also, what kind of bogostats interpret people who want to transition away from oil to cleaner energy as NOT being anti-oil? Duh.

2480 2018-08-30 19:22:04 I assume the oil will continue to move by train and trucks, more cost, less risk???

2536 2018-08-30 19:16:44 Court brought up valid points.  Hope the Libs satisfy the requirements. I fully support new green energy but until that is fully viable, pipelines = safest transportation method.  Oil WILL reach it's markets, trains anyone?
2537 2018-08-30 19:16:39 So let's keep all the oil and water safe and in the ground. Glad First Nations cares so much about Canada. Canadians don't need jobs or a properly run an economy. We will all just live off the land and walk everywhere because cars consume oil. Oil bad!
2538 2018-08-30 19:16:32 Any nation that would send its children to Asia where opium is easy to find to police people who have yet to teach an elephant or a camel to swim is in need of leadership buy a man of integrity who doesn't owe the Oil Lords.
2539 2018-08-30 19:16:20 I love how all the supporters of the pipeline don’t live in the lower mainland Vancouver.   Next time let’s drill some holes in the middle of each Canadian city for oil.  . . See how everyone else likes it.
2540 2018-08-30 19:16:12 i need to stock up on some vitamin e oil, these spots gotta go
2541 2018-08-30 19:16:00 The bottom line is we need both teams mountain and energy east built. If this government can’t secure Canada energy future than hopefully the next government will. We don’t need to import oil from anywhere and should only export. Extract, refine, export. Pretty simple mandate
2542 2018-08-30 19:15:55 Almost time to short Oil for big gains! I think this is gonna come back quite a bit. Low to mid 60s next week or two. $UWT $OIL $USO $OLO

Note to self: use grassfeed butter. 


2545 2018-08-30 19:15:46 No. We should find more sustainable ways of creating jobs and careers. Oil and gas has crashed before and I’m sure it will again.

2547 2018-08-30 19:15:45 We aren't talking about cars. We are talking about Jack Flaherty. Cars don't perform better 5000 miles after an oil change. They perform worse over time.
2548 2018-08-30 19:15:42 What does one make caster oil from then?
2549 2018-08-30 19:15:14 Leathery skin dotted with large and prominent oil glands, which is lightly attached around the fruit, enabling it to be peeled very easily in comparison to other citrus fruits.

2550 2018-08-30 19:15:12 So I just got my oil changed and when I asked the guy about rotating my tires he said they couldn’t because the front outer edges were worn. But everything else is fine. Any car ppl know if this would be a problem like winter time? I have all wheel drive if that matters
2551 2018-08-30 19:14:54 Great example where ‘energy’ really means ‘oil’ because that’s how limited our political imaginary has become.
2552 2018-08-30 19:14:53 Well if there was an oil leak, I’m glad they fixed the aircraft. I don’t want to be on anyone’s news.
2553 2018-08-30 19:14:51 You've set the bar too high for me. I'm just going with frozen peas with a dash of olbas oil. It's all I've got in...
2554 2018-08-30 19:14:22 Someone who isn’t blocked by Oil Beak tell him he was wrong about the Trans Mountain pipeline and I was right!!
2555 2018-08-30 19:14:21 The number of Canadians cheering the #TransMountain decision shows just how weak and pathetic we have become as a country. This will not slow oil usage in Canada. It WILL cripple the best and most environmentally responsible oil industry in the world.

2560 2018-08-30 19:13:56 Really? My prayer is for you and all Muslims to pls allow Jesus Christ into your life. U can continue in ur faith but pls, accept Him while u are still alive. Forget all those teachings about Him that u were tot. He is the Truth, the Way and the Grace we are enjoying. Hallelujah
2561 2018-08-30 19:13:55 Beard oil is what I need to do to step my game up. There are some local companies I need to invest in
2562 2018-08-30 19:13:46 Do oil changes count as pooping?  I am sure he would need oil changes since he is an android.
2563 2018-08-30 19:13:38 So the pipeline is complete then, taps are flowing? Did I miss something? Or what oil flowing our the end where it is and were scooping up the goo and tankering it to sea? What?
2564 2018-08-30 19:13:38 Sad to hear the bad news about growing investments in oil & gas
2565 2018-08-30 19:13:18 Lies, it's not xenophobic related. Thus guys are selling fake goods which they manufactured themselves. Products like coca cola, cooking oil, etc. On top of that they selling expired products.
2566 2018-08-30 19:13:16 Oil?
Do they mean #Fracking
2567 2018-08-30 19:13:09 @iam_Davido does your hands smell like hot oil
2568 2018-08-30 19:12:57 You have the largest oil reserves in the world. 
You have had socialism for 20 years.

There is not a single historical problem your country can't fix economically with that amount of oil cash, unless your system is so weak it screws even all that oil up.
2569 2018-08-30 19:12:55 Yeah .. 50% oil workers ought to be female ? And 50% of nurses, kindergarten teachers or physios male ??
2570 2018-08-30 19:12:52 He's a songwriter yes. My peev was he's not a genius burning the midnight oil writing symphonies. He has a huge team of writers behind him. Hence a few of the plagiarism legal cases. Like I said cracking artist yes. But the modern great etc the media use. Na not for me.
2571 2018-08-30 19:12:52 Ayy shatt! Inlab na inlab bal ko! Hahaha!! Sana oil
2572 2018-08-30 19:12:51 We did Nation and Province first when instead of diversified energy we handed out checks. This bone headedness started waaay back when we ignored everything that was in front of us to reap in oil money.
2573 2018-08-30 19:12:46 メンズエステ勤務の皆さん、キッチンやお風呂の排水溝の掃除してますか？私たまった汚れが超ムリなので入店次第大掃除してしまいますが、皆さん平気なんですか？
2574 2018-08-30 19:12:43 Wonk wonk Shawnee.  We're now going to pay more for Canadian electricity and oil.  Good job blow hard!
2575 2018-08-30 19:12:39 Do you take pumpkin seed oil?
2576 2018-08-30 19:12:13 Will you have enough oil for your lamp when #Jesus returns?

Matthew 25:3 KJV
They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:
2577 2018-08-30 19:12:10 But you like our money. Well I hope Alberta will finally cut you off from out oil and power. Good luck with that ha ha
2578 2018-08-30 19:12:02 The guy changing my oil is asking me questions about my car and I answer everything like I’m Patrick Star ordering at the Krusty Krab #Uhhhhhhhhhh
2579 2018-08-30 19:11:59 Multinationals operating in Canada as branch-plant operations (i.e. oil & gas) are truncated operations deprived of R&D brains and production sinew of an integrated corporation and left only with the functions of production and sales (Steven Clarkson).
2580 2018-08-30 19:11:52 Oh I’d be a cooking NPC prob. Or an herbalist. Cooking, they’d need to find a bunch of ingredients to make “no wheat or wheat by product cookies” and herbal...I’d need seeds which would then be squeezed, to be used for a pesticide. (Like neem oil)
2581 2018-08-30 19:11:47 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2582 2018-08-30 19:11:04 Oil, salt then oven for approx 10mins. Only bearable way to eat it.
2583 2018-08-30 19:10:56 Black seed oil kuda.
2584 2018-08-30 19:10:54 Wow! I knew the Spectator was a left wing website but at least it was anothe perspective on local news. Unsubscribing after seeing this. I  oil sands, the world’s most ethical oil
2585 2018-08-30 19:10:36 I blend it and mix with coconut oil and lemon juice to apply on my face against pimples.
2586 2018-08-30 19:10:34 Them oxtails from Big Easy was oil 
2587 2018-08-30 19:10:20 By your logic.

White Paper said a conservative estimate of oil would be $113. Despite being warned this was nonsense.

White Paper used GERS as the basis of the economic case. Now Indy folks say GERS is a conspiracy.

Why were we lied to? Why did they force us to vote Yes?
2588 2018-08-30 19:10:09 Beverly Hills High School receives around $300,000 per year from a cluster of oil wells on campus.
2589 2018-08-30 19:10:08 No, what I am is realistic and in the majority of Canadians that support this pipeline. Not in the minority who have no knowledge of the oil industry and believe this is a step in the right direction. It’s not. Crude will still be railed and tankered from OPEC countries
2590 2018-08-30 19:10:05 エクストラバージンオイルってなんか卑猥だよね。
2591 2018-08-30 19:09:53 Wonder what would happen to our economy if oil prices quintupled? -
2592 2018-08-30 19:09:46 I wish I coulda been an old timey doctor that sold snake oil from a busted up covered wagon as a cure all... cept I'd sell weed because it really is a cure all.
2593 2018-08-30 19:09:42 Again with the lame get a horse logic, we will still use what oil is produced with reducing as required . You can go too work cleaning up orphan oil and gas wells! When your done that work clean up the tailings ponds klots of money in oil and gas still 
2594 2018-08-30 19:09:24 Toddler moments this evening: 
 a request for olive oil to be drizzled on soup
 screams when I halted him tidying farmyard animals
 a dinosaur mash-up of the popular '10 little ducks'
 having a sponge squeezed down my sweater sleeve
2595 2018-08-30 19:09:18 fuck the oil king! @JustinTrudeau #TransMountainPipeline
2596 2018-08-30 19:09:18 Does my sassiness upset you? Why are you beset with gloom? 'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells, Pumping in my living room.~M. Angelou
2597 2018-08-30 19:09:10 since my butt has exploded due to this country food , i have mad stretch marks and this expensive ass lil oil that i bought better work 
2598 2018-08-30 19:09:07 A win, isn't a win if the reality is that our energy dependency on low cost barrels is subsidizing the non-rule followers. The Oil price will be $150 in 18 months, not due to demand, nor supply, but replacement costs after the meltdown 3/3 #TransMountain
2599 2018-08-30 19:09:00 Agreed .
2600 2018-08-30 19:08:58 The powerful presence in the Canadian political system of multinationals viewpoint that is articulated by Canadian business (branch-plant, i.e. Imperial Oil) community, exert pressure on governments from embarking on a Canadian strategy.
2601 2018-08-30 19:08:55 自分事ですが去年限界を迎えて
今年から筋トレして少し健康になりました。
2602 2018-08-30 19:08:40 I use the hard round brush for sketching and blocking. The oil pastel brush from Loish's brushset, (You can find this from a simple google search) it's a really good textured brush.
And for blending, I use a brush I made myself (60% scattering, smoothing and 5% strength)
2603 2018-08-30 19:08:37 Yesterday I had trouble recalling his name—all I could think of was “something to do w/oil” and “Tillis,” but that’s name of our Senator from NC with the huge NRA donations and ties to Cambridge Analytica

2605 2018-08-30 19:08:27 Dr Pepper is castor oil and pee and soda mixed together
2606 2018-08-30 19:08:27 @StefNicole so I finally bought the basics to your pm routine lol I’ve been using an indie brand cleansing oil and that’s it.. should I be using a second cleanser? I bought the fresh soy cleanser (I know my skin likes it) juno, tarte knockout, aqua moist. 1/2
2607 2018-08-30 19:08:12 I somehow manage to get beard oil in my eyes everyday.
2608 2018-08-30 19:08:11 This guy reminds me of a used snake oil salesman...tells you what you want to hear just get that sale/vote. Intellectually challenged, no moral compass and just spews BS all day long. #BlahBlahBlah
2609 2018-08-30 19:08:11 in the last two days I’ve spent an hour and a half in total brushing out my hair, with two different types of oil. And I never fail to think of that scene in The Little Princess where she puts a curse on the mean gal’s hair and it all falls out while she’s counting brush strokes
2610 2018-08-30 19:08:09 I expected a much much much worse transition period, especially post the revolution. I expected the counter revolution like the one by hafter and I expected there would be issues with the oil supplies, and I expected all those things to destroy Libya alot more than it has done
2611 2018-08-30 19:08:01 Today I took the day off to:
- get everything set up for my side projects
- physical health routine check up 
- get my car checked out and an oil service 
- routine health check up for my dog 

... and get a pedicure. 

Have a personal maintenance day at least twice a year!
2612 2018-08-30 19:08:00 CBD oil, edibles w/low THC? Cuts my Opiods in half, boosts energy! Trump Admin evidently wants me DEAD, instead of real relief against AGONIZING NERVE PAIN! Nearly every thing's failed for: Fibro, RLS, Migraines, Neck, Lower back, Sciatica. CBD: Instant relief, also can sit up!
2613 2018-08-30 19:07:57 Bruh Somebody Really Put Car Engine Oil In K.Michelle Ass
2614 2018-08-30 19:07:42 @dissonance_pod yeah, but bacon shrimp truffle oil wood fired pizza is awesome
2615 2018-08-30 19:07:24 300m electric vehicles by 2030??? That's an oil crisis.
2616 2018-08-30 19:07:22 Sorry u misused the word check. So u mean the 700 retired guys that cost us $400m per annum to check oil $$ on our behalf.. lol trust me not only the dead will be deprived of been citizens...
2617 2018-08-30 19:07:02 I got a free headlight for my car today. Why?
Because I go to the same place to get my oil changed and they’ve been asking me to get it replaced for over a year now. 
They finally said fuck it...we will change it on the house.

PROCRASTINATION. WORKS. 
2618 2018-08-30 19:06:56 I just bought a cool new hat  No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
2619 2018-08-30 19:06:32 Hi watching Prime in bed with my candle and oil burner so trying to chill.  I need to sort my prescription and collect meds,, go forva walk and get the train to amilies at some point but trying to not stress stress does not help dieting, a chemical released. xxxx @garysnowpatrol
2620 2018-08-30 19:06:24 We know that oil & gas must be phased out in the coming years. Unfortunately Alberta & Canada are totally unprepared for the energy transition taking place, having delayed any significant transition planning. Today's ruling forces change on us now #cdnpoli #ableg #TransMountain
2621 2018-08-30 19:06:19 Но не факт))))
2622 2018-08-30 19:06:13 Slap some castor oil on it bro! Our family doesn’t do ugly!
2623 2018-08-30 19:06:10 My mom just bought me a salt lamp so now I’m really gonna feel like a hippie with that and my oil diffuser
2624 2018-08-30 19:06:09 He paid $4.5B for an existing line to remove it from the headlines. This order prevents the expansion. Oil will still flow as it has been 65 years. In the meantime the real winners are the USA and Saudi.
2625 2018-08-30 19:05:30 So far this week I lost my s.o and have to find a way to move, my apartment complex caught fire and I cracked the oil pan on my e30. Legit so sad and broke and fucked and idk how I’ll ever recover from any of this  as I depleted all I had getting here 6 months ago.

2630 2018-08-30 19:05:01 He’s a Snake Oil Salesman who has never experienced a cloudy day in his life. My President, a disgrace.
2631 2018-08-30 19:04:56 Seems some what to define racists as ONLY those who wear sheets and burn crosses. The reality is...far more racists sleep ON their bed linen and burn the midnight oil in Anytown, USA. This is why there is subtle & systemic racism. Good people notice & #resist the legacy of hate.
2632 2018-08-30 19:04:45 Women and accountability, is like water and oil
2633 2018-08-30 19:04:45 100% agree. There is a huge opportunity for the franchise and city..... if they do it right. The days of Used Car or Snake Oil sales pitches from Larry need to be over. You can be bold and unique while staying smart about every step. I gave up my tix years ago for a reason.
2634 2018-08-30 19:04:43 Spending the day with my daughter. #ThursdayFunDay
2635 2018-08-30 19:04:34 Well, and oil sands, specifically. That's a new one on me. I give the oil sands ppl credit for trying/managing to reduce energy intensity but this is a new line on me. Even Ezra only went so far as "ethical."
2636 2018-08-30 19:04:33 G: You ever heard of E, V, O
Me: You mean evo? 
G: No it means extra virgin olive oil, Have you not watched Rachel Ray?
Me: I used to, why?
G: I have her pot set, you know the one from Ross. 

Morning conversations with my manager 
2637 2018-08-30 19:04:24 I was going to wash my face in the shower with my body shop facial wash but accidentally grabbed my vitamin e oil instead and barely noticed when it wouldn’t lather on my face
2638 2018-08-30 19:03:57 tan with oil on face
2639 2018-08-30 19:03:55 We are out at the NHRA Chevrolet Performance U.S. Nationals at Lucas Oil Raceway in Indianapolis today!
2640 2018-08-30 19:03:36 Ok ship the oil by train see how many tankers won't spill over
2641 2018-08-30 19:03:35 Have you ever had chili oil? A spoon full will certainly wake you up...! Or knock you down.
2642 2018-08-30 19:03:19 So now the oil is going to be shipped by train?.... That is significantly more dangerous to the environment than a pipeline, is less efficient and will generate less revenue for First Nations people.
2643 2018-08-30 19:03:05 Sadly I am not surprised anymore.

If only these countries could find more oil then the west could save the Rhinos
2644 2018-08-30 19:03:03 What jobs? There weren't going to be many permanent jobs with the pipeline. A refinery would have been better. That way we can clean our oil & stop selling it at discount prices.

Alberta can also grow tons of hemp & cannabis with all those fields.

Fossil fuels isn't the way
2645 2018-08-30 19:03:02 I can’t wait to go home, light some candles, drink 4 glasses of wine, and listen to Al Green while taking a nice bath with a splash of lavender oil.

Whew lawd. I deserve.
2646 2018-08-30 19:02:49 Stunning.
The horse.
(not you  )
2647 2018-08-30 19:02:40 The amount of oil that my face produces in a day is not ok
2648 2018-08-30 19:02:37 Mr Sheer is lying. He criticizes Trudeau when all Stephen Harper did was cut the time for Environmental studies.  When he did that the Oil person being interviewed concluded "now we can build the pipelines". Translation: Environment be damn.
2649 2018-08-30 19:02:22 We shall cancel the new and existing pipeline altogether tomorrow and let you BC green loving people figure out how to get oil from Saudi or US. That certainly has no impact the environment right?
2650 2018-08-30 19:02:10 David, 

As an expert on Trump’s finances, will you let us know whether Trump has ever had any significant investments in oil.  Reading this article, I wondered how Russia might be connected with Trump’s Scottish properties and the only thing that popped out was oil.
2651 2018-08-30 19:02:10 I’m raising a little hippie. 

I start coughing and Harley runs into my room, grabs an essential oil, runs back to me and rubs it on my neck. 

She says “there, I fixed it all better”
2652 2018-08-30 19:01:50 If you know Butts background that oil would stay in ground forever. Canada can run on Unicorns and fairies
2653 2018-08-30 19:01:50 Made up a peppermint oil spray and been running about the house like a dafty spraying it in every corner, hopefully be no more monster spiders now! 
2654 2018-08-30 19:01:30 Modiji is a big nautanki baaj & patra is a big joker it's correctly said as a director of  ONGC he could mange to loose 41 oil blocks with Vedanta if jokers are there then only joker can be fit  ambani's show of Rafale deal, Adani's show of power/CNG, vedanta's show 41 OIL BLOCKS

2658 2018-08-30 19:00:58 Reading the Superman III novelization, I was struck with how many action beats are paralleled in MAN OF STEEL:

3. Fighting an evil version of himself
4. Fighting a round robot
5. Rescuing a child
6. Rescuing a dog

2660 2018-08-30 19:00:51 Since you brought up donors, let's take a look at who is giving to @tedcruz's campaign:

74,000 from Lockheed Martin
1.1 million from Oil Companies
1.1 million from securities and exchange (hmm, the people that crashed the economy in '08)
7 million from private companies...
2661 2018-08-30 19:00:51 natural oils from the scalp, making your scalp produce MORE OIL resulting in even oilier hair, but this doesn’t mean don’t wash your hair at all, just wash your hair regularly that fits for you
•brushing your hair and spread the oil from the root of the hair to the bottom
2662 2018-08-30 19:00:50 @boricua96ca - It's definitely safe to drive after adding the Gumout Multi-System Tune-Up to your oil. We recommend starting your engine immediately after pouring it in and let it run 5-10 minutes to mix completely. Let us know how it works! Best, Gumout
2663 2018-08-30 19:00:35 use your Google and type in "world oil consumption" dozens of reports on the increase of oil, gas, and fossil fuels in general  world wide

2667 2018-08-30 19:00:21 ずいぶん遅くまで起きてるなー　ふにゃ…俺は眠い…(つω´)。゜
2668 2018-08-30 19:00:12 Dems speak of socialism as if it’s the greatest thing since sliced bread, yet to confirm the ludicrousness of their comments all anyone has to do is take a look at Venezuela’s socialist platform which is akin to cancer eating away the nation. Venezuela’s oil rich yet destitute.
2669 2018-08-30 19:00:09 So this Purpul hair oil produce better results than Native child products?
2670 2018-08-30 19:00:01 That's what Alberta did to its own citizens & now you think you can do that to other provinces with impunity. 

Hey, you know who else thought this pipeline was a terrible idea? The Alberta Oil Workers Union.  Ya ever look up that much?
2671 2018-08-30 18:59:58 Sorry, no oil today.
2672 2018-08-30 18:59:51 And your adding me to a “liberal troll list” shows you toeing the Breitbart/ Alex Jones/ faux tolerance shtick. I  feel sorry for good folks taken in by Trump’s snake oil salesman routine. But folks like you, who use it to keep people down... it’s fun to watch it crash down.
2673 2018-08-30 18:59:45 Canadians are able to accept natural gas and oil and pump it on both coasts. We should be able to ship it safely too; the Court is wrong to slow down our economy. We need to inspect all ships and shipping operations before we sell our oil to any other ports offshore.
2674 2018-08-30 18:59:42 Let's keep buying the clean Saudi oil then. Great idea from you!
2675 2018-08-30 18:59:37 what about legalizing marijuana so vapers could use real marijuana oil in their vape devices instead of the synthetic killer stuff? The war on drugs just produces more casualties.

2678 2018-08-30 18:59:24 Lack of oil, for an entirely different set of reasons.
2679 2018-08-30 18:59:19 0 fucks today. Netflix, jammies, comfort food and dirty jokes. A coconut oil for the soul kinda day.
2680 2018-08-30 18:59:17 We never knew! We decided to return saudi's and go after Iraq instead. It wasn't until a democrat was voted in to take out Osama. Bush wouldn't because of his ties to Saudi money and oil. You want justice than where are the 500 parents to the children we have.
2681 2018-08-30 18:59:16 It’s not a bad group. It’s a group of people who are comfortable with the world the “bad group” built for them and are too afraid(?) or just sort of greedy to let that comfort go so that others may have a place at the table.  But if ya put enough soap in the oil...
2682 2018-08-30 18:59:03 Ammoniacal, the reddest trace contains oil on a toy to look awfully cute in my book as male hustlers look sculpted.
2683 2018-08-30 18:59:02 Every day the Trans Mountain pipeline is delayed is a day China adds more electric buses and cars, more solar and wind power is built. Those won't erode the market for ALL oil, but I'd be curious to see an economic forecast that takes those trends into account.

2685 2018-08-30 18:58:58 Every day I wake up and tell myself that TODAY is the day I start exercising and become vaguely attractive, and all I can say is that it’s 7.57 pm, I’ve eaten my own weight in pan-fried noodles with chilli oil, and I’m now in bed  with my teddy bear 
2686 2018-08-30 18:58:53 Only used olive and rapeseed oil for decades so unable to comment on effectiveness 
2687 2018-08-30 18:58:41 Find a place to pick your own cotton and weave your own clothes. Carve out wood shoes for your feet. If you're so against oil use a little imagination and and find some fortitude to stop your usage instead of virtue signalling.

2689 2018-08-30 18:58:40 No it is only @BJP4India that is saying this. BJP is running and hiding from any kind of questions about the current situation. They are creating diversions but it is boomerranging. The trollers are burning night oil abusing and justifying everything. Won't work!!!@BJPBengal
2690 2018-08-30 18:58:32 How is it that crude always manages to put on gains, although it is also priced in dollars as is Gold & Silver, on days where the dollar gets stronger? What an amazing phenomenon...U.S. oil futures finish above $70 a barrel. #FAKEMARKETS
2691 2018-08-30 18:58:27 I defy the man who created it. I'll die on this hill with a smile on my face. And yeah, I'm shit with dates, but give me 10 minutes to explain how the oil and steel embargos foretold the attacks weeks in advance.
2692 2018-08-30 18:58:25 How do we expose the hidden cost of “”oil” in open source?

2694 2018-08-30 18:58:15 I need black pepper oil dear friends...
2695 2018-08-30 18:58:15 I also use a natural chamomile toner because my skin gets a lil sensitive too, so it's the perfect mix. I don't have too much acne anyways so idk if this will work for you, hope it does  (you can use tea tree oil with your moisturizer too)
2696 2018-08-30 18:58:12 #Tarsands oil is the cleanest and environmentally friendly??    Literally no one believes that Andy.  Not even the ppl profiting on it
2697 2018-08-30 18:58:07 Of course humans can alter the climate. Have you not heard of the nuclear winter?  It is only mans arrogance to assume that we can control everything. We have been arming the world with every barrel of oil  burned , and now the earth is going to turn on us.
2698 2018-08-30 18:57:40 Там написано фильмы. Тетрадка — это от Нэтфликс имелось в виду
2699 2018-08-30 18:57:29 And when you’re done with that you could check out all river of used cooking oil frequently flowing down the alleyway behind the restaurants between 18th and Champlain in Adams Morgan.
2700 2018-08-30 18:57:28 The only thing that popped out at me is Oil, one of Russia’s main businesses, and not a commodity that fits in with Trump’s hundreds of other businesses.
2701 2018-08-30 18:57:28 So I don’t know if anyone has noticed me saying how broke I am well ya girl just picked up tips and I got 97$ BUT GUESS WHO NEEDS AN OIL CHANGE 
2702 2018-08-30 18:57:26 CBC is finally starting to cover his failures!!!!!  Finally !! Because there is no successes to report on...    Now we are dependent on Saudi oil... Wow what a sellout !!!
2703 2018-08-30 18:57:12 None of these vessels you describe are loaded down with 650 000 barrels of toxic, flammable sludge like Aframax Oil Tankers are.
2704 2018-08-30 18:57:12 This oil change is taking forever 
2705 2018-08-30 18:57:09 unlike curly hair where it takes longer for the oil to go down the hair follicle because of the curl pattern.
•only condition the ends of the hair more than the roots, you can clog up the pores which slows down hair growth
•rinse/wash your hair with cold water
2706 2018-08-30 18:57:03 Dating a Married Man is not the problem until you see your name saved as engine oil.
2707 2018-08-30 18:56:49 Switzerland grew fat on centuries of secret banking. Norway wisely invested it's oil revenues into a national wealth fund.

Nothing to do with EU membership or not. 

 UK just squandered everything.
2708 2018-08-30 18:56:46 I need to be reminded to get an oil change in the morning, before work at 8am, and an alarm will not suffice.

2710 2018-08-30 18:56:37 #WolfPAC we need to work to get money out of politics and take back our democracy. Only then can we effectively drag the capitalists destroying our planet with wars for oil and the meat industry’s deforestation of the Amazon.
2711 2018-08-30 18:56:33 One of my last classes in law school was Intro to Petroleum and Geoscience. There’s no oil pockets left, only globs trapped in certain kinds of rocks. Those will be depleted in 10 years.
2712 2018-08-30 18:56:19 green energy investment is fine but Where does Singh get the $$$ in the short term to pay for all his programs when he abandons oil industry
2713 2018-08-30 18:56:10 True. However, I am extremely concerned about Canada first and the Millions of Dollars pouring into Protester Groups to stop Canada's Oil Industry. Don't these people in Canada realize they are shooting themselves by doing this? Incomprehensible!
2714 2018-08-30 18:56:07 The court’s decision is a painful reminder that Harper’s legacy of incompetence continues to haunt Canadians. Despite having nine years in office, he did not build a single pipeline to the west coast freeing Alberta oil. Trudeau will be cleaning up Harper’s mess for years!!

2720 2018-08-30 18:55:17 •if you have straight hair you are more prone to having oilier hair than curly haired people 
•the reason for that is because as oil comes out of your scalp it reaches the root of the hair, if you have straight hair the oil can easily go down the hair follicle unlike curly hair
2721 2018-08-30 18:55:07 I pass out pretty much anytime I get blood drawn. It's anxiety more than anything. The one time I didn't think I was going to, the needle popped out..  my blood looked like motor oil  told her to be prepared and blacked out. When I came to she said she thought I was joking
2722 2018-08-30 18:54:59 >Trudy can't build his pipeline that he wants now that he bought off of the oil company the other month that wants to build it
>Trudy to no ones surprise wants to push a handgun ban

2728 2018-08-30 18:54:17 That goes to say how FLAWED the entire process was, eh?  So many warnings and yet PM did nothing (except buy the $4.5B projected that other oil companies didn't wanna touch).  We are in trouble here.
2729 2018-08-30 18:54:11 Your transition to cleaner energy using pipelines narrative doesn’t account for this $15B @JustinTrudeau says we’re missing out on by not loading it onto oil tankers at Westridge in Burnaby and sailing 650 000 barrels to toxic, flammable sludge through Metro Vancouver to Asia.

2755 2018-08-30 18:51:37 it used to be that oil & other commodities were a large part of the 'strong-dollar' system which propped up the US dollar artificially; now it is a small part; they have several schemes;  I wish the dollar floated freely (&down) so as to encourage the domestic US economy;

2766 2018-08-30 18:50:03 Some people hate oil so much maybe it’s time to take oil revenues out of the equalization formula like they do with Quebec hydro. Then people wouldn’t have to take dirty money
2767 2018-08-30 18:50:00 You could be right,but I can't understand that they can run pipelines all across Europe, through several countries, but we can't get our oil across a few provinces and help the country.
2768 2018-08-30 18:50:00 Change out transmission and differential oils. While not requiring frequent service, these fluids must be changed according to service intervals. Always use transmission fluid or gear oil of the recommended type and viscosity.
2769 2018-08-30 18:49:58 well done, very pleased for you.
2770 2018-08-30 18:49:52 Pablo, we are going this debate in Indianapolis. It's just simply not cost effective in the long run. Lucas Oil Stadium was built on the premise it kept the Colts in town and as such will likely keep Indy from getting their desired public funded soccer stadium.

2772 2018-08-30 18:49:44 If you do a little research you will find that us oil companies who stand to lose billions if Canadians start selling their oils oversee are on the list of donors to the tides Foundation. Us oil companies are paying off these groups to squash their competition.

2776 2018-08-30 18:49:16 Exactly my thoughts on it. Why should it be the shipowner who has to pay several millions for a tool to try to clean the lousy dirty product the rich oil majors have produced.
2777 2018-08-30 18:49:09 The issue with the pipelines is not much the stuff that spills, but rather what happens to the stuff that doesn’t spill. We need to eliminate the demand for the oil, or we’re all screwed.

All the good highly skilled people working right now in Oil and Gas - we need them - desperately - to build the economy of the future. Our government needs to buck up and let them do it.
2790 2018-08-30 18:47:41 Definition of irony...the @CPC_HQ tweeting that Trudeau isn’t pushing green energy solutions and got thumped in the court by indigenous people over pipelines. The oil company supporting PC party. #hypocrisy #canpoli

2793 2018-08-30 18:47:34 As a child I made a "love potion" with a friend in their garage using oil, paint and any other chemicals we could get our hands on. His scary mum went ballistic as we'd made bucketful of our toxic flammable potion. Wonder what she did with it all?
2794 2018-08-30 18:47:20 RFS is the same as a taxpayer-funded payment to fuel blenders?! Come on. I assume oil is not a viable product in your opinion since it is allowed its 100+ years of gov’t support?
2795 2018-08-30 18:47:16 @robbrecken Canada is suffering death by leftist advocacy...one issue at a time. You are wrong. Trudeau is playing a masterful hand. He won’t lose BC/Ont/QC seats, helps phase out oil, serves his globalist masters. Notley is disposable. She will be an activist again W/I 36 months
2796 2018-08-30 18:46:54 Canadian government just paid their American oil friends a 637% more than KM paid for pipeline in the first place. This is BS for Canadian taxpayers. Of course the shareholders approved. Who wouldn't for a 637% return on investment.

2805 2018-08-30 18:45:41 I'm not disputing where the oil is produced. I'm saying building pipeline capacity from Alberta through another country (i.e. the US) requires negotiation and agreement from that country. Alberta being independent of Canada does not change the fact that US cooperation is required
2806 2018-08-30 18:45:37 mfs prob think I'm sweating but it's really coconut oil on my face 
2807 2018-08-30 18:45:35 Disgusting and highly disturbing revelation. Govt should do more to alleviate the level of abject poverty and deprivation. Nigeria is the most prolific producer of crude oil in Africa.
2808 2018-08-30 18:45:27 They are essentially the same thing because NEB didn't really question CAPP. 

How many ways does the NEB need to demonstrate its bias in favour of big oil before you see them for the scam that they are?
2809 2018-08-30 18:45:26 Deal. What I’m thinking if @MLacrosse_UCF wins is not safe to share on Twitter. But it involves three gallons of baby oil, an alpaca and a crockpot of goulash.

 Not only do we need to stop oils sands mining immediately, We need to import more Saudi oil and start putting it back into the ground and replacing all the oil we have taken out if the oil sands over the last 50 years. Of course we would need more pipelines tho.
2814 2018-08-30 18:44:48 I cannot state strongly enough how dishonest you are. You are a fake, a fraud, a carnival barker, a snake oil salesmen and a scourge on our country. #FakePresident #FirstAmendment #FreePress
2815 2018-08-30 18:44:34 You guys choose "oil up the titties" or "how many fingers" show!!  lol...Just an FYI... don't ask me to "flex" anything, it won't be pretty!!  Omg!! Too funny!!
2816 2018-08-30 18:44:24 Ji itna oil..
2817 2018-08-30 18:44:19 @ddailyreport  The high rate of unemployment in Nigeria is proof of bad thinking.These industries need revamping like Coal in  Enugu, Tin Mines in Jos, the Ajaokuta Steel, the Steel rolling plants, the Textile Coys in Kaduna & Lagos. Producing only crude oil is an economic sin.
2818 2018-08-30 18:44:16 i think ima skip the gym & change my oil today
2819 2018-08-30 18:44:15 today I learned how to do an oil change and change the brakes to a car :,-)

2821 2018-08-30 18:44:07 Yah. I use coconut oil to hide most of my fat too lol it makes you look so in shape hahaha jk. But thank you. I work out occasionally too.
2822 2018-08-30 18:44:02 Where can you buy black seeds 
(Nigella Sativa) not in oil form.
2823 2018-08-30 18:43:52 PR's debt sprung mainly from schools and utilities, i.e. infrastructure. Prolonged 11 year recession due to end of gov't tax incentives and dependency on oil. 64,000 left in 2014. 2/3 of the avg. income of the mainlands. Poor country hit hard.
2824 2018-08-30 18:43:44 Indonesia menempati peringkat 1 dalam produk pertanian,

2825 2018-08-30 18:43:30 sooo many things will stop expansion. so many things:

1. future oil price collapse
2. bigger lawsuits, likely from youth
3. more extreme weather that politicians can't ignore
4. protest
5. better investment options
6. EU trade embargoes due to our shitty policies

it's over!
2826 2018-08-30 18:43:26 Finally getting an oil change 
2827 2018-08-30 18:43:16 Since living with @BenCaughers I’ve had to deal with his addiction to bananas..... it’s worse than not having milk, or oil, or air to breathe.......
2828 2018-08-30 18:43:09 jason state ham chews ovens and spits oil
2829 2018-08-30 18:43:08 my dad has my car for an oil change :(
2830 2018-08-30 18:43:03 Alaskans own 255,787 shares of ADVANTAGE OIL & GAS LTD, worth $1,683,957. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in CANADA.
2831 2018-08-30 18:43:01 All this talk of trade and tariffs is probably a good thing. Being at the mercy of the US for Oil Sales is not #TransMountain
2832 2018-08-30 18:42:57 oil cartridges on deck dm me ##  delivery available too
2833 2018-08-30 18:42:57 Man I'm excited for Michigan football this year.  Anxious to see what my man Harbaugh has built. Lots of changes this off season. Jimmy's been burning midnight oil.
2834 2018-08-30 18:42:51 I very much admire his achievements, however, one man is not going to bring to an end climate change, which is an natural cycle of events relative to the sun's activities and complex cosmic events every thousands of years. Neither will fishing, oil drilling etc be stopped.
2835 2018-08-30 18:42:44 Oil Change on a bissshh  
2836 2018-08-30 18:42:30 I can’t believe I forgot about black seed oil. My family used to drink that in the mornings and we never got sick.
2837 2018-08-30 18:42:29 Well Eamonn it was good to highlight it for the sake of others. Try St Johns Wort Herba and oil. This is the remedy for shingles other medication allowing.
2838 2018-08-30 18:42:24 Try to keep up with ma car and get its oil changed then I run over a median 
2839 2018-08-30 18:42:18 He is fixin' to blow his head gasket and exhaust system.  The oil will mix with water after it gets hot and cracks the block, damaging the piston and valves.  We need a new motor. #impeach45
2840 2018-08-30 18:42:05 Blown away! And still can't quite believe sanity may at last prevail. Live three blocks from ocean and having environmental nightmares at thought of 7-fold tanker increase and inevitable spill of oil. #KinderMorgan #Pipelines
2841 2018-08-30 18:41:31 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. New York City sleeps.
2842 2018-08-30 18:41:30 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
2843 2018-08-30 18:41:15 I use weed oil for my chronic illness that's all 
2844 2018-08-30 18:41:14 #Jobs in Alberta, and in B.C., and the prospect for #Domestic oil in Canada are gone, because a bunch of emotionally disturbed, environmental hippies would rather want Canada to be #SubjectandSubservient to #Foreign oil, like those imported from Saudi Arabia.
2845 2018-08-30 18:41:09 We getting ours done too. But we actually need the stuff they're saying this time lol. But still..... .....................just the oil change pls
2846 2018-08-30 18:41:02 Seen that b4, they inject their arms with synthol oil. Looks raw
2847 2018-08-30 18:40:52 It's internship. You would be surprised what she could learn. Try any major property developer. The big churches. Oil servicing firms. Don't underestimate what they do in these places.
2848 2018-08-30 18:40:46 Dont use oil while boiling pasta...
2849 2018-08-30 18:40:38 drank some coconut oil & i swear i been nauseous ever since,nasty ass shit.
2850 2018-08-30 18:40:37 No major income streams is a big problem for most AIM companies. Many oil or mineral exploration ventures will operate with 30-40% chance of success. They way I am viewing #EVRH is that the asset is the data signified by the deals, and that is what will be bought to market
2851 2018-08-30 18:40:31 Don’t worry oil prices are going to fall as no Federal worker can now afford gas if he has to pay extra for Walmart imports from China

2855 2018-08-30 18:40:05 Oil City
2856 2018-08-30 18:39:35 Russian economic might all tied to price of oil. Still low now, so not much they can do. Part of the idiocy of Trump is to push coal. Push natural gas, nuclear, solar, wind.
2857 2018-08-30 18:39:18 Oil is a lot more than just being a marine animal defector.

Just look at how shiny Arslan is!
2858 2018-08-30 18:38:58 How did they even have oil pressure?? XD
2859 2018-08-30 18:38:56 There’s about 7.5 billion reasons or more that oil truthers and opposers should both be livid with the feds right now. My hard earned tax dollars that they take more and more of every year just pissed away into oblivion. Good job team! #KinderMorgan #refundplease #TrudeauMustGo
2860 2018-08-30 18:38:50 LOL  The Snake Oil Salesman took their money and now they want their money back.  Hilarious.. here’s the thing, The Dems call him a crook then turn around and send him money.   God help them.
2861 2018-08-30 18:38:36 Yeah, we all know Canadian men working in the oil industry (or logging, or mining, etc) are nothing but rapists and druggies.
Are you not even slightly ashamed of yourself?
2862 2018-08-30 18:38:33 All these 2nd Generation biofuels go for the structure of plants, not the oil or fruit
2863 2018-08-30 18:38:23 The hardest pill I had to swallow this summer was the Fish oil pill. Y’all seen how big that thing is ?
2864 2018-08-30 18:38:11 Me: It not about the pipeline

Albertans: you green libtard idiot, a pipeline is the safest way to transport oil

Me: its not about the pipeline, its about the oil tankers

Albertans: a pipeline is way safer than rail you idiot!!!


#bcpoli #abpoli #TransMountainPipeline
2865 2018-08-30 18:38:05 "Cleanest... environmentally friendly?"

Did Scheer just come out in favor of Solar Panels?

Look, I want a pipeline to save Alberta's economy as much as anyone else, but let's not beat around the bush and pretend that oil is clean or environmentally friendly.
2866 2018-08-30 18:37:57 International laws do not allow such provocative and hatred activities, the world is standing on the throne of the war, the international crisis will work on oil It will use by terrorists the enemy of humanity, for their fascinating purposes.

2867 2018-08-30 18:37:57 It wasn’t @Jacob_Rees_Mogg @Nigel_Farage or @BorisJohnson these snake oil salesmen are your unicornists 
2868 2018-08-30 18:37:56 Why can you not obey God's law. OIL is NOT RENEWABLE or BIODEGRADABLE period justin#TransMountain
2869 2018-08-30 18:37:49 Poverty increased, from 1978-2003 per capita income fell by 40%.

Hugo Chavez was only democratically elected in 1998 and that’s when land reform started, new hydrocarbons law, royalty charges for foreign oil companies
So Venezuela problems started before land reform
2870 2018-08-30 18:37:44 99% of Canada's exported oil goes through the USA.  So WTF are you talking about when you say "How would a Republic of Alberta be more successful getting pipeline built through the US than Canada"
2871 2018-08-30 18:37:30 I'm gonna melt a lot of bottle of olive oil on this one.
2872 2018-08-30 18:37:28 How is he doing?  Any news?
2873 2018-08-30 18:37:27 Hot showers . Lavender essential oil. Aim for sleepy pull not pain pills 
2874 2018-08-30 18:37:24 Oil was taken off the tariff list last time around May come back if trump imposed more
2875 2018-08-30 18:37:19 I didn't know I needed truffle oil in my life.

Until now.
2876 2018-08-30 18:37:11 Cleaned my whip up & got her oil changed  her body is ready to ride up to center
2877 2018-08-30 18:36:51 They are appeasers who turn a blind eye for lower oil prices.
2878 2018-08-30 18:36:51 Just build a rail line to the coast.  Nobody seems to oppose that way to transport oil
2879 2018-08-30 18:36:48 Lol nawa
2880 2018-08-30 18:36:45 Reliable 
Oil change every 3k 
Fully loaded
2881 2018-08-30 18:36:43 oil already on tariff list. they say theyre going to slow down, but keep buying..
2882 2018-08-30 18:36:38 Justin doesn’t care.  Sadly, terribly, for the rest of Canada, he would prefer leaving the oil in the ground whilst he prays for magical fairies to supply $Billions for social programs
2883 2018-08-30 18:36:31 Forget it. Canada’s oil industry is going to be “phased out” Alberta and Saskatchewan should think about joining the United States. They would be the two richest states in the union...
2884 2018-08-30 18:36:23 Wow. You truly love your bubble. No contradiction. Stating truth. I'll make it simple for you. Increased population = increased demand for oil use/products. I'm saying that you'd rather support a corrupt country than your own. Pretty simple.
2885 2018-08-30 18:36:22 Time will tell how long it takes them to realize that most of the Woke don't have any money!
2886 2018-08-30 18:36:15 Why can’t the oil guys just mind their business and not tell me about the five things I need to have done to my car THANKS

2896 2018-08-30 18:35:18 Presumably they will issue a petro wallet to everyone in the country and simply pay the people their cut of the countries oil revenues, sent to each registered/wallet/citizen?
2897 2018-08-30 18:35:18 Albertans now face a hobbled energy industry,  a cap on jobs and growth from the oil sands, more expensive home heating and gasoline, strained national unity - and, for all that, still no new pipeline to tidewater. (1/5)
2898 2018-08-30 18:35:09 Ой бляяяя, я ж с тобой в реале общаюсь. Ну, всё это конец. Мы съебёмся друг от друга ибо я такой же долбаёб. А потом снова сойдёмся, ибо я если пристану, то фиг от меня избавишься. И тогда миру πздец.

2915 2018-08-30 18:34:02 You’ve contradicted yourself.  Do you not see your argument is cyclical?  Complaining we’re not shipping out oil & complaining we import oil

2919 2018-08-30 18:33:19 @RachelNotley You get to explain to your voters why they will be paying for Kinder Morgan pipeline that will never be built.  The courts have said NO.  Why didn't you wait for their decision?  Oh right, those oil boys.....
2920 2018-08-30 18:33:17 For energy, oil prices in usd- some costs go in ars (40% or so via ypf)- doesn’t it technically make roics better ex- political uncertainty? (Understanding political doesn’t go away, but just saying)
2921 2018-08-30 18:33:15 Alberta should shut the taps for a few years and when the rest of Canada and the world come begging for oil tell them that they have to build a pipeline first and the oil now costs $200/barrel. 
Problem solved. 
Next...
2922 2018-08-30 18:33:12 We know rex was fired. We know the American government has added more sanctions to russia. We know we expelled diplomats. We know president trump got NATO countries to increase defense spending. We know trump has pressured Germany to end their oil deal with russia.

2924 2018-08-30 18:32:58 "Well, I do love surprises...~"

Her back arched a little once the oil touched her back, feeling the warm liquid spread across her pristine skin as she released quiet little coo.
2925 2018-08-30 18:32:45 Walking in for an oil change and getting fucked over 120$ because they added an inspection and tire rotation just cause I’m a blonde girl with Starbucks in my hand. Jokes on you, I know my shit so thanks for the reimbursement  What a joke.
2926 2018-08-30 18:32:38 These idiots inject oil into their muscles. There are docs on them. It is mental!
2927 2018-08-30 18:32:27 Gerald Butts & Justin Trudeau thought they were so smart.  So long as they made a show of approving Trans Mountain, they thought they could get away with feigning deep support for oil & gas while sneakily sabotaging Energy East & arbitrarily cancelling Northern Gateway. #cdnpoli
2928 2018-08-30 18:32:22 My habenero pepper plant puts forth a fiery oil in its attempt to prevent me from eating it.
2929 2018-08-30 18:32:17 Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer speaking to reporters in Winnipeg rn on the Trans Mountain court ruling. Calls it "another gut punch" to oil workers and taxpayers
2930 2018-08-30 18:32:08 You can't make everyone happy, you are not coconut oil.
2931 2018-08-30 18:32:06 As Edina Monsoon wailed on her 40th birthday: "It's like I hit an oil patch at thirty-five and now I'm just skidding towards the grave!"
2932 2018-08-30 18:32:01 I have a $42k 06 Toyota Highlander Hybrid with 233k+ miles. $30k in gas and $12k in oil changes. It a $80k needibg a new ICE & battery.  The Model 3 same mileage @ $0.13/kWh will be a $50k car!  Only $9k in electricity and no oil changes.
2933 2018-08-30 18:32:00 Remember Stuart from the AmeriTrade commercials? I’m pretty sure he just changed my oil
2934 2018-08-30 18:31:55 I would guess 37
2935 2018-08-30 18:31:53 Canada again allows foreign oil interests to keep #TransMountain from happening while those same nations reap massive benefits from their own natural resources. Yeah what a great victory.
2936 2018-08-30 18:31:51 Hooray / your economy killing, job killing anti-progress ideology won!  Hooray!  Enjoy your absence of education, healthcare and welfare when the taps run dry and we can’t afford our quality of life.  Long live Saudi oil!  Moron. #cdnpoli
2937 2018-08-30 18:31:48 Again we (AB) should stop paying our equalization payment until the east stops importing oil. AB-SK-NFLD&L all have it ready for the taking but some provinces and the feds would rather support some foreign country low on human rights. #waytogojustin #cdngov

2940 2018-08-30 18:31:31 Went to get an oil change and ended up paying for 200$ worth of stuff, then got a flat tire right before I had to be to class 
2941 2018-08-30 18:31:10 Pour oil.
2942 2018-08-30 18:30:56 Those are d ones you know.

Look further & there are multitude of miscreants ready to assume 'leadership'
2943 2018-08-30 18:30:46 I think peanut butter that requires you to "stir-in" the oil should be outlawed.
2944 2018-08-30 18:30:41 Yeah, but he's going to break out the pink sneakers and then just you wait~
2945 2018-08-30 18:30:36 the oil barons have made sure I can't do that, haven't they? A corrupt, gouging industry that impedes alternatives.
2946 2018-08-30 18:30:35 I wish I can retweet up to 10times. This union gotta work
2947 2018-08-30 18:30:35 It’s all part of his off oil plan.  Most of his tenure has been dedicated to sabotaging all that’s good about Canada. Excuse me, but why the fuck would anybody vote for that?
2948 2018-08-30 18:30:31 고양이 얼굴이 안 보여
2949 2018-08-30 18:30:29 Have you seen saskatchewans oil!? Trans mountain would have saved room in our pipeline which is at max capacity. We are trucking oil 14 hours away.

2951 2018-08-30 18:30:27 I suppose you will be refusing that dirty oil tax money as well. Less money for he bands
2952 2018-08-30 18:30:21 ah but now she falls into a carefully crafted trap , Should Scotland be A) Independent , B) have Full Fiscal Autonomy , C) Remain a host to Westminster parasitism , oil theft and parking trident?

Am sure she will go for it.

Cue - Scotland has no need for a tertiary referendum.
2953 2018-08-30 18:30:08 @DeborahNBC5 Here is a great recipe 4 AVOCADOS:  serves 6

2954 2018-08-30 18:29:58 So says the fat man, stuffing himself with goodies created by the "Big Oil" companies.
2955 2018-08-30 18:29:54 리라님 울 길드 오시면 좋을텐데~~~~
2956 2018-08-30 18:29:49 Not many talking about how fucking easy City got with that draw.
How many fucking barrels of oil did that cost?
2957 2018-08-30 18:29:45 Team Indica here.. need a perfect 50/50 indica/cbd oil to vape and I’m chilling..
2958 2018-08-30 18:29:38 @narendramodi sir whats ur stake on rising crude/oil prices?? Is our government doing anything in that area since thats hurting the rupee as well.. please do something... Lots of love n respect..
2959 2018-08-30 18:29:37 Oh ok. So it's ok to buy foreign oil from countries that do not hold the same environmental standards as Canada does? Then ship that oil to Canada. "As long as it's not your backyard" right?
2960 2018-08-30 18:29:36 If the earth is flat ... how deep does one drill for oil?
2961 2018-08-30 18:29:28 This is a great thing for climate change and supporting cleaner oil countries.
2962 2018-08-30 18:29:23 Well when you recommend we shut down the oil industry, what would be our immediate alternative.
2963 2018-08-30 18:29:17 While my truck is at the shop getting an oil change, I can
1. catch a fish
2. Clean said fish
3. Cook said cleaned fish
4. Feed my family with said cleaned, cooked fish
5. Read tweets about how changing your oil makes you a man
2964 2018-08-30 18:29:11 how not to get burned by oil when frying (a thread)
2965 2018-08-30 18:29:09 Girl I had them for a week and still went 41 weeks!! I did everything even castor oil and Ashton wouldn't come. 

Try dancing though ! Or wall squats.
2966 2018-08-30 18:29:03 Once again Kindermorgan pipeline gets held up by people, I think that took a bunch more money from some US oil Barron so we’ll never get our oil to tidewater and have to keep selling it at a 15% discount
2967 2018-08-30 18:28:56 EQUITIES DOWN
VIX UP 
DXY UP
US 10Y DOWN
OIL UP
2968 2018-08-30 18:28:41 By 1930, Venezuela was world’s largest oil exporter and 1973 OPEC oil embargo quadrupled the country’s national budget.

The 1986 oil crash caused huge problems for Venezuela - IMF imposed harsh austerity measures in 1989 and pressured Caracas to support huge corpotocracy
2969 2018-08-30 18:28:41 hi from Hilary Duff and us oil!!
2970 2018-08-30 18:28:35 Should be provinces not on board with oil and gas industry will lose Alberta and Saskatchewan funding.
2971 2018-08-30 18:28:33 We care more about the environment and the future of this beautiful coastline over oil industry profits?
2972 2018-08-30 18:28:14 My parents are so proud of me for buying MY OWN CAR earlier this year, they paid for my car to be serviced this month. I got oil change, new brakes, tire rotation etc.
2973 2018-08-30 18:28:07 Congratulations to one of our former students, Mike Messer! Mike, who is a member of the Steamfitters Local 601 spent the last three years as a helper/fitter. Mike is now a journeyman welder for Intercon, Enbridge Oil Lines.

2975 2018-08-30 18:27:52 Please psg is not a oil merchant club so watch your fingers
2976 2018-08-30 18:27:24 Canada is fortunate to have large numbers of indigenous people who put protection of the environment and survival of the world ahead of oil company and finance industry profits. What truly matters in the long run? #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli
2977 2018-08-30 18:27:23 A bit of hot oil in the hole and a whole colony of termites crawl out.
2978 2018-08-30 18:27:21 I put on my salads with arugula & feta cheese maybe green onions - just with squeeze of lemon, olive oil, sea salt & pepper  & on pizzas & freeze whole for smoothies later
2979 2018-08-30 18:27:19 Isn't the Earth flat?  I trade oil, too. #OOTT
2980 2018-08-30 18:27:13 Nice work!  Did you treat them with oil?
2981 2018-08-30 18:27:07 Woke up today and told myself I was going to splurge & take myself shopping.. sitting at the shop getting my oil changed instead.  
2982 2018-08-30 18:27:00 Canola Oil???. In #LCHF we also avoid Seed/Vegetable Oils due to their high inflammatory O6 profile.
2983 2018-08-30 18:26:45 The deebees spray oil and explode a little why can’t Lambent spray imulsion blood and as they drop explode in a similar way?
2984 2018-08-30 18:26:39 The ruling today will delay the project but will also increase the cost to the CDN taxpayer, the only winners here is the USA and other foreign oil producing countries.
2985 2018-08-30 18:26:19 2日に一回は貧血で視界が白くなるって先輩に話したら、びっくりされた事がある

丈夫な体が欲しい
2986 2018-08-30 18:26:18 카섹스는 야외플인가 아닌가
2987 2018-08-30 18:25:53 Why would any Canadian support this decision. Canadas’ loss = win for non democratic oil production.
2988 2018-08-30 18:25:47 Don't support this disgusting practice.
2989 2018-08-30 18:25:24 If there were an oil spill at the Burnaby port it would be devastating. If Alberta decides to stop allowing oil from NE BC to flow to Burnaby thru existing pipeline BC would lose billions. If AB stops all shipment of oil to BC that would be devastating to BC.
2990 2018-08-30 18:25:20 It's beyond that. We've been a subjegated nation by psychopaths who threaten and carry out on said threats. Think BP oil and Fukushima. The shadow war, now that was terrifying. I think it's safe to say we're off that precipice.
2991 2018-08-30 18:25:17 How much do you think Iran, Russia, Saudi and Venezuela care about human rights, let alone the environment? 
Oh wait, they don't, and that's why we MUST be the world's #1 oil supplier, not the above listed nations.
2992 2018-08-30 18:25:12 Я тоже тебя )))
2993 2018-08-30 18:25:06 Yo slicker den some baby oil
2994 2018-08-30 18:24:59 Downeast Maine. Although I don't drink milk, it's about 4.50 a gallon. Fruit has tripled, veggies have doubled and meat prices have gone up a third. Not to mention gas and heating oil prices. Ugh! This fat, orange turd is pissing me off. 
2995 2018-08-30 18:24:52 @realDonaldTrump would appreciate if you can show some concern on rising oil prices... I have seen that ur one tweet can bring down the prices.. please do something about it... Lots of love n respect..
2996 2018-08-30 18:24:50 เฮียไม่นอนนุชก็ไม่นอน
2997 2018-08-30 18:24:47 AA says drivers are being 'ripped off' after petrol prices soar to a four-year high despite the cost of oil falling. The average price of unleaded is now 130.2ppl - the most expensive since August 2014 - meaning it now costs almost £72 to fill up the tank of a typical family car.
2998 2018-08-30 18:24:44 We love you Josh! The more minutes you have getting help the stronger you will become! Leave no rock unturned! Hugs for "Oil Tot"!
2999 2018-08-30 18:24:31 Scanner Traffic: Peoria HazMat now reporting 100 to 120 gallons of diesel fuel and hydraulic oil at accident at Clark and Darst Streets.
3000 2018-08-30 18:24:27 #Tonight PS is talking of adding value.. But how do we achieve this when we are exporting crude oil instead of refined oil to create jobs opportunities and increase income on imported goods?
3001 2018-08-30 18:24:17 Finally ordered some lavender essential oil
3002 2018-08-30 18:24:13 Oil filter on back of engine . Surely zx6r
3003 2018-08-30 18:24:10 Good deflection Jim! How’s our pipeline coming? Exports in oil are done cause of your government! Free trade with the states and Mexico not looking good cause of your government! Liberal incompetence at its finest!
3004 2018-08-30 18:24:07 Climate leaders buy oil from other countries! Keep fighting the good fight brother!
3005 2018-08-30 18:24:03 Pipelines are by far the safest way to transport oil. Period.

Trucks, trains and ships are dangerous, expensive and damage the environment.

Pipelines mean thousands of jobs, higher wages and more tax revenue.

Pipelines=and 

We must get pipelines built!

3008 2018-08-30 18:23:54 lmao dripping oil
3009 2018-08-30 18:23:53 Ok if so wealthy that they “pay”billions then why are they selling subsidized oil overseas and to US for cheaper then Canadians pay?
3010 2018-08-30 18:23:43 Even with conservatives, there’s a weird tendency towards statist autarky around oil you don’t get for any other sector. Makes no economic sense.
3011 2018-08-30 18:23:42 Dont need oil for that, US dollar going higher hurting EM.  Also, globally housing bubbles are bursting.  Global deflation has started
3012 2018-08-30 18:23:38 I’m now learning about this Chevron oil deal. Holy shit they made bank on us. Gave $20 mill to Saddam Hussein and got 78,000,000 barrels of oil. 

1 barrel = 42 gallons.

3014 2018-08-30 18:23:22 Interesting to note, two 6'3+ goalies with a late 2002 birthday are expected to enter the WHL this year. Sebastian Cossa (Edmonton Oil Kings) and Talyn Boyko (Tri-City Americans) can both fight for a starting spot.
3015 2018-08-30 18:23:21 คิดถึง
3016 2018-08-30 18:23:14 Lol so what's up
3017 2018-08-30 18:23:13 The fact we don’t want to build a processing plant should be an indication we don’t want it to be permanent.  We want to diversify economy so we aren’t dependent on oil so much.
3018 2018-08-30 18:23:08 @jkenney in a time when things are so volatile and uncertain with the USA oil is our only stability
3019 2018-08-30 18:23:06 thanks it's like playing hooky from school but iam going
3020 2018-08-30 18:23:04 It just proves that this wasn’t about a pipeline at all. It was about what comes after the pipeline, putting it in oil tankers and sailing it through Metro Vancouver 7X’s more than anytime before. All those other reasons we were lied to, for why it should be built still exist.
3021 2018-08-30 18:23:01 마이니치 이치오쿠워 즈츠오 카세구 코토요..!!!
3022 2018-08-30 18:22:50 I’ve seen tons of animated movies. 1 line in Cars 2 stands out to me though. It’s when Mater says “If there ain’t no oil under em, then there ain’t no oil in em”. Whatever U put inside will come out eventually. Words, thoughts, actions, are they representing Christ? @EEAnetwork
3023 2018-08-30 18:22:40 Juve n Valencia will qualify
3024 2018-08-30 18:22:31 Swedish mayo tastes like vegetable oil and mustard - I miss polish mayo, why'd our grocer stop stocking it 
3025 2018-08-30 18:22:27 There’s no reason to not be importing oil products just because we export oil products. That’s like saying we have huge forests, and so should be paper independent and not buy foreign paper products
3026 2018-08-30 18:22:13 So UNIPEC will stop buying US oil again then?
3027 2018-08-30 18:22:03 No oil, no butter, no crust
3028 2018-08-30 18:22:00 Secondly  when did Ann7 started boasting?
Where was themba that yr
All these witnesses are trying to mix water with oil thinking we are fools
3029 2018-08-30 18:21:53 @jkenney I think it is time for Alberta to withhold equalization payments. The rest of Canada does not want our oil so why should they get any benefit from it. What can the PM threaten us with.
3030 2018-08-30 18:21:44 Kinsley is running out of time  I’m finna castor oil her ass up outta there 
3031 2018-08-30 18:21:43 I love butter, it’s so rounded and adds tons of flavour - but there’s SO much complexity to olive oil and endless flavour combinations.
3032 2018-08-30 18:21:37 Does anyone have that comic that pillories the argument: ‘you can’t use oil and criticize it at the same time’? I believe it ends with the interjector proclaiming ‘I am a very smart person’.

I can’t seem to find it and I anticipate needing it a lot in the near future.
3033 2018-08-30 18:21:37 Rail would be public overnight oil would fail as would most large energy companies smaller local government orgs would fill the gap
3034 2018-08-30 18:21:35 نقابتنا بعد الرسايل اللي بعثوها اليوم يحتاجون مطوع يقرا عليهم وبعدها يتفل بوجههم يمكن يصحون #القطاع_النفطي
3035 2018-08-30 18:21:28 I just put coconut oil on my hair, is my life finally coming together?
3036 2018-08-30 18:21:27 Ummm ok. Get off your computer/electronic device as it's made with oil products. Shut off your heat and build a house with your sticks a mud then let's talk. #hypocrisy
3037 2018-08-30 18:21:22 So clearly @MichelleRempel hasn't even bothered to read the Supreme Court decision & couldn't care less about indigenous rights being disregarded, environmental concerns completely out of the #KM equation nor a completely flawed NEB process. Just oil. What a surprise. Not.
3038 2018-08-30 18:21:20 I refer to my oil pen as my magic wand 

It’s like a part of my hand
3039 2018-08-30 18:21:17 I’ve tried CBD oil but I don’t think it was strong enough. And the stronger you want, the more expensive it becomes
3040 2018-08-30 18:21:15 He should switch to cbd oil cart pens. Those nicotine vape pen won’t do him good
3041 2018-08-30 18:21:14 Castor oil is freaky because its sooo thick, but it absorbs into your skin...hence the word carrier :-)

It destroys FABRIC so be ready and don't wear your favorite anything messing around with it...DAMN will be uttered...
3042 2018-08-30 18:21:10 Gnarley old phil drops massive truth bombs about standard oil and windows 95 with ease
3043 2018-08-30 18:21:07 Can I encourage all that I have been on @lupus_cbd_oil oil for 3 months now and it has transformed my life. No I am not able to function as a normal human, but I do manage to get up and wash almost every day. It might be 4pm in the afternoon, & back in bed by 7 but this is fab
3044 2018-08-30 18:21:01 "Coaldan, Virginia"?  Just "Irving oil canada" rearranged... Skeptics: wrecked.
3045 2018-08-30 18:20:53 I need to learn to take care of my car better so tomorrow imma take her to a shop to get everything checked out   Cause i know i ain’t had a oil change since like April 
3046 2018-08-30 18:20:51 no one said get rid of oil tomorrow. But we need an exit strategy and better options.
3047 2018-08-30 18:20:46 I bought a final call and some tea tree oil from the dudes outside McDonald’s on pine and my mom was cheesing the whole time man it’s wild
3048 2018-08-30 18:20:41 못또..못또..츠요쿠낫떼..
3049 2018-08-30 18:20:38 the only reasons why Yeltsin didn't annex Crimea himself: the Chechnya war, low oil prices (no money), he blackmailed the US with that, he blackmailed Ukraine with that (to push the election of RU-friendly president Kuchma)
3050 2018-08-30 18:20:35 Why Is Everyone Buying CDD Oil?
3051 2018-08-30 18:20:31 Anyone who things oil is going to disappear in our life time need to give there head a shake. It is in almost everything we do. The phone in our hand made of plastic, that oil. The packaging anything you buy, that oil. Canada is just making itself and international joke!
3052 2018-08-30 18:20:27 You can try Peppermint essential oil on your temples.
3053 2018-08-30 18:20:17 Or we could build our own refineries and govern our own green laws rather than shipping our oil to countries with fewer environmental regulations.
3054 2018-08-30 18:20:10 Like… heating it up with oil?? I didn’t know you were supposed to!! 
3055 2018-08-30 18:20:09 아따시..아따시..츠요쿠나리따이...!!!
3056 2018-08-30 18:20:06 Congrats to everyone who worked so hard to fight the Trans Mountain Pipeline, after our government turned into an oil company, the Indigenous peoples and allies fought long and hard, risked arrest, risked injury, to protect our planet for future generations.I'm so happy for you.
3057 2018-08-30 18:19:58 Cheap beer can sometimes work - cheap olive oil... #NotSoMuch
3058 2018-08-30 18:19:57 @realDonaldTrump can you please focus on increasing oil prices instead of focusing on CNN n shitty things.. i know ur one tweet can bring down the oil prices down... Please do something.. please regarding that...
3059 2018-08-30 18:19:54 But will you commit paying for complete restoration and/or lifetime compensation for any damages inflicted on citizens of Canada by your oil transport? Freeloader!
3060 2018-08-30 18:19:52 International laws do not allow such provocative and hatred activities, the world is standing on the throne of the war, the international crisis will work on oil It will use by terrorists the enemy of humanity, for their fascinating purposes. @TahirulQadri #OurProphetOurHonour
3061 2018-08-30 18:19:38 — foolish speech, the God's gaze slide back towards him as smoothly as black oil on water. Perfect lips split into a remarkably deviant simper, and the Deity's hand rises to frame his jawline, regarding the little Elf a moment. 

Taking a knee, the Ancient —
3062 2018-08-30 18:19:35 Singh. You are completely ignorant on the subject of the oil industry and what Canadians want.
3063 2018-08-30 18:19:28 I would love to see you two oil wrestle and the winner gets their ideas voted in
3064 2018-08-30 18:19:13 NO SALAT FOR OIL!
(Aber umgekehrt: hmmm )
3065 2018-08-30 18:19:01 Try applying coconut oil or shea butter before applying your hair remover. I prefer to trim with scissors to make it neat cos I HATERS hair bumps 
3066 2018-08-30 18:18:59 太るから?だから僕を突き放すの?オイルが嫌いなの?オイルに罪は無いだろう…?
3067 2018-08-30 18:18:58 Et franchement mon empreinte carbone n'a rien à voir avec celle des céréaliers ou d'un armateur qui fait avancer son géant des mers au doux mélange gaz oil souffre. Si ?
3068 2018-08-30 18:18:47 "Where has a 100% healthy society existed without snake oil"
3069 2018-08-30 18:18:47 It’s weird that so many of the people telling addicts and homeless people to get a job, or service workers to get a better job, are in the oil and gas industry. How bout you get a better job, buddy?
3070 2018-08-30 18:18:44 自分の体弱すぎる…体調万全な時が少な過ぎる……体重少し増えてから少しは良くなったけどまだまだ足りなさすぎる

この体力の無さでも差がつくんだろうな…くそぅ…
3071 2018-08-30 18:18:42 Try giving him coconut oil or fish oil
3072 2018-08-30 18:18:27 it owns a pipeline that has oil flowing through it right now, the expansion is stalled...your government started this mess, but sure don't let facts get in the way 
3073 2018-08-30 18:18:27 Got to be #AAOG Oil any minute!
3074 2018-08-30 18:18:25 I had a short chat with a restaurant staff member who was questioning why I got fries when I’m gluten intolerant. Technically fries can have gluten depending on what type of oil they’re fried in. But this person actually thought potatoes had gluten in them.
3075 2018-08-30 18:18:16 วันนี้เพิ่งขายเกมให้พราวไปพอดีเลย
3076 2018-08-30 18:18:13 Feel better! I’m sure there’s some kind of magic essential oil you can use to help 
3077 2018-08-30 18:18:10 I can smell the oil getting hot when I close my eyes.
3078 2018-08-30 18:18:03 지랄이다 진짜
3079 2018-08-30 18:17:50 AB had better routes  Energy East made more sense Quebec squashed that Even Northern gateway was better then TM  All squashed
Assessments are done nationally AB does not do them  
AB is left shipping oil at a discount to the US What they wanted all along Check enviro funding
3080 2018-08-30 18:17:48 we need oil right now. We also need to start actively/genuinely figuring out how to replace it. The tide is slowly turning.
3081 2018-08-30 18:17:37 Eat more fish. Put aside the $you spent in fish oil capsules and enjoy fresh fish
3082 2018-08-30 18:17:35 Fucking hell drawn against more oil barrens. Pretty much a W for us then #LFC #CarabaoCup #Chavski #Oilmoney
3083 2018-08-30 18:17:27 Also when it’s built, it will help pay for infrastructure, schools etc. also pay down debt. Also save the environment due to getting safer, more ethical oil to the market, taking market share away from Saudi and others where environmental standards are weak or non existent
3084 2018-08-30 18:17:25 “Don’t forget to put the olive oil all over”
3085 2018-08-30 18:17:02 #BabyGirl loved helping on the truck and is excited to help me change the oil on the van Saturday. She can rattle off each step and show me where everything is to be done. This excited at 5? Do they make #Mechanic style childrens books?
3086 2018-08-30 18:16:56 why is it so hard to find vegan evening primrose oil, i'm sad :(
3087 2018-08-30 18:16:56 The #Trudeau government is about to buy a court-cancelled pipeline project for $4.5 billion — blind to the new reality of oil divestment and imminent catastrophic effects of accelerating climate change.  Oil infrastructure is a dying industry — 1950s business models won’t work.
3088 2018-08-30 18:16:29 You are holding a barrel of oil in your hand while you tweet this.
3089 2018-08-30 18:16:23 Also I’m on the very oily skin spectrum so ANYTHING mattifying/oil free/gel based is my boo.
3090 2018-08-30 18:16:19 GUILT FREE!!!
1 tbs olive oil or butter
1 tbs almond flour or regular flour
1/2 cup almond milk or regular milk
1/2 cup chicken broth
1 cup parmesean cheese
Salt, pepper, italian seasonings.
3091 2018-08-30 18:16:11 리라님..지구를 부탁합니다
3092 2018-08-30 18:15:58 if you are saying it's just the evil oil industry and it doesn't deserve federal money for flood protection, then I'd say you need to look at your own energy use.  Best of luck to you.
3093 2018-08-30 18:15:58 THE FUTURE WILL BRING A HUGE DECEPTION. IF YOU KNOW GOD'S PLAN, YOU KNOW WHAT THAT DECEPTION IS. FROM TV TO THE PULPITS, "satan" HAS "his" HANDS ON EVERYTHING. BUT "he" CANNOT STOP YOU FROM LEARNING GOD'S PLAN. FINAL ROUND,YOU EITHER HAVE ENOUGH CARDIO(OIL) OR YOU DON'T! GBY!
3094 2018-08-30 18:15:56 They're amazing. Tough as fucking nails. I really liked cooking them in olive oil and lots of garlic and then serving the whole thing on toasted bread
3095 2018-08-30 18:15:54 Just cancel the new one, pay the penalty and stop the existing one altogether. Send oil to BC by rail and let’s go back to the 1900s.
3096 2018-08-30 18:15:51 Hahahaha
3097 2018-08-30 18:15:50 Not that I didn’t know how to do it before but finally changed my oil all by myself and I’m feeling pretty good about 
3098 2018-08-30 18:15:49 The West wants our Tullow oil @husseinmohamedg and our market. Nothing special, not in our best interest #Tonight
3099 2018-08-30 18:15:46 Whip together 9 oz elderberry with 8 oz eggs. Mix into  Olive Oil. Roast. Serve a la mode
3100 2018-08-30 18:15:40 Ahhh, so what you're saying is we should cut all trade agreements with countries other than the US for oil transport?  closet #MAGA supporter? this just makes us 100% dependent on our cousins down south, and here's a secret... their leader hates us.
3101 2018-08-30 18:15:29 壊れそう
3102 2018-08-30 18:15:27 Oil fanatics refuse to see the forest for the choking smoking wildfires.

That's your problem, not ours. The entire of the rest of the world is moving from what is now being called a "sunset industry", for myriad reasons, & not one is limited to 'cold fusion'. Move on, Mr. J
3103 2018-08-30 18:15:27 Cage plays an Army ranger who is convinced to stage a home invasion and helps Louisiana recover from the BP oil spill. In the end, he sells the film rights to his story for a considerable sum. Maggie Gyllenhaal costars.
3104 2018-08-30 18:15:16 행성 파괴 하시고 싶으시나봄
3105 2018-08-30 18:15:14 I need a oil change  UGGGGH Lol I fucking hate going to Walmart
3106 2018-08-30 18:15:13 baking is low key overrated..: anyone can put something in the oven and wait but can everyone stand in front of a hot fire while oil attacks you? no
3107 2018-08-30 18:15:10 Fair. But Canada needs oil. We have oil. Something needs to change so we can be self sufficient in oil. And if BC doesn't want the impacts of oil, I presume they don't want the benefits either (ie transfer payments).
3108 2018-08-30 18:15:10 ... yes?
When oil companies spilled oil in the gulf, they had(&continue)to tout how much safer & cleaner their practices are now
When WF & Facebook were revealed to be abusing customers personal data, they launched ad campaigns claiming they'll do better
They all TALKED about it
3109 2018-08-30 18:15:07 The cleanest, most ethical, environmentally freindly energy in the world is not oil regardless the country it may come from.
3110 2018-08-30 18:15:06 Have you tried cbd oil or capsules from Holland and Barrett they are really quite good
3111 2018-08-30 18:15:01 You still need oil to manufacture your oh so precious solar panels doofus! Plus you wont think the sun is that cool once the liberal government starts taxing you to use it. Haha mindless people need to take a hike.
3112 2018-08-30 18:14:50 How about we stop the old pipeline altogether and send oil to BC by rail? Oh wait, u can also star supporting Trump by getting some oil down south.
3113 2018-08-30 18:14:30 Same with Palm Oil
3114 2018-08-30 18:14:27 fighting CC/GW def not "all-or-nothing". 1st benefactor of inaction re GW is Big Oil (oil, gas, coal). strange bc Big Oil knows oil/gas 50yrs left (BP annual rpt). reduce oil/gas burn extends biz life. Big Oil selling their soul 4 short term profit + they know it. Thats suicide
3115 2018-08-30 18:14:20 "The craziest and whitest things in the world cannot be pursued or even ingested - they must be kissed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
3116 2018-08-30 18:14:03 ههههه 
3117 2018-08-30 18:14:00 Here's the Canadian reality broken down: you work and pay taxes to pay for shit you can't use because you make too much money, while jobless socialist protesters accept American money to protest the Canadian oil industry that pays for the very benefits they claim as human rights
3118 2018-08-30 18:13:57 Now you see Group D, now you don't oil surplus vanishes ahead of Iran deadline
3119 2018-08-30 18:13:56 나도 성혀니의 이쁜이가 되고 싶다
3120 2018-08-30 18:13:46 また頭クラクラしてきた………前は原因紅茶だったけど、今回原因何だろうサプリ？
3121 2018-08-30 18:13:32 Issue is that it takes time and money. High risk requires better payback. If not, other countries to get oil. You know the countries that behead protestors.
3122 2018-08-30 18:13:30 You are not a nice person. Your suggestion we just live without incomes is small minded and self serving. Oil continues to reach tidewater by rail. And it will continue regardless of your protests. But thanks for resigning my province to fascists and fear mongers.
3123 2018-08-30 18:13:28 My boss just gave me a neck massage with prominent oil 
3124 2018-08-30 18:13:25 낫닝겐
3125 2018-08-30 18:13:19 Trying to wait for first oil change to prevent repetitive trips to dealer so I haven’t had it looked at. Just hoping there is a setting I’m missing.
3126 2018-08-30 18:12:51 well you should. because you are owned...

by Big Oil, Big Pharma, Russia, and Jesus (apparently)
3127 2018-08-30 18:12:50 After the oil discovery in Kenya the west is giving all attention.
I know oils come with alot of chaos and  in most cases those countries contribute  alot so that theyalways remain in control. Kenyans should be careful and wise enough rise above that.
3128 2018-08-30 18:12:49 Vitamin C micro-dermabrasion face wash and clay tea tree oil face mask from The Body Shop - I wouldn't recommend tea tree oil for dry skin though.
3129 2018-08-30 18:12:48 FYI...the other day I rubbed my knees down with peppermint essential oil with castor oil as the carrier.

The swelling went down in my right knee B4 my eyes. Now I may have just moved the fluid around,  but pain subsides also... $0.02
3130 2018-08-30 18:12:46 Oil first, corn second.
3131 2018-08-30 18:12:45 For perfect cakes, get the Betty crocker stuff but replace water with milk, add an extra egg and replace the oil with twice the amount in melted butter. Thank me later.
3132 2018-08-30 18:12:44 Except they're not the ones who are speaking.  They're simply providing the pipelines through which the information travels.  As is so often the case, the conservative position is abysmally stupid.  It's like saying an oil pipeline or a water pipeline has First Amendment rights.
3133 2018-08-30 18:12:42 Kinda like believing you can sell oil forever isn't it?
3134 2018-08-30 18:12:40 And in 3 years what changes have they spearheaded?  Let’s add gender diversity criteria to all project and identity requirements for EIA’s then have our environment minister spout out that women are in danger by oil workers.  Sounds crazy but it happened.
3135 2018-08-30 18:12:33 Oil and liquin!
3136 2018-08-30 18:12:28 When a rail car or semi truck full of oil crashes and creates more ecological damage than a pipeline would have, I don’t want to hear a peep from anyone who opposed #TransMountain. #justsayin
3137 2018-08-30 18:12:27 苦しくなってきた
3138 2018-08-30 18:12:20 Plus they found $12B to give farmers a bail out after the tariffs and trade war started by the ignorant snake oil salesman.
3139 2018-08-30 18:12:09 Are their traditional fishing grounds at risk, will their coast line be covered in oil if there is a oil spill etc. Will their $14 billion a year tourism industry be effected by a spill? The answer is no, but that will effect BC'ers. Good possibility since tmpl has had 86 spills.
3140 2018-08-30 18:12:01 are you just using oil by itself or are you using thinners?
3141 2018-08-30 18:11:55 وبعدين 
3142 2018-08-30 18:11:52 Attempting to make oil free chips...please crisp up! 
3143 2018-08-30 18:11:36 Lol you actually believe the oil companies aren’t subsidized? & spill clean up costs, do you actually believe the oil companies & not the taxpayers get stuck with those bills?  Not to mention Alberta’s tarsand’s immense toxic wastelands/ponds & abandoned well-heads. Wake up buddy
3144 2018-08-30 18:11:10 Fam someone need to oil these chairs cus this squeaking noise is annoying the hell outta me
3145 2018-08-30 18:11:10 I was annoyed that I already have to get an oil change but I called to make an appointment and I had totally forgotten I get free oil changes for 2 years BLESS UP
3146 2018-08-30 18:10:52 Support for RT is provided by The Farmer's Tan Fraternity, which strives to coerce big oil.
3147 2018-08-30 18:10:50 olive oil + sea salt
3148 2018-08-30 18:10:48 5 those people don’t understand real fishermen anyway
3149 2018-08-30 18:10:43 Is anyone into oil diffusers? I’m shopping around, any recc? 
3150 2018-08-30 18:10:31 Best bit about being with Jamie is getting free pizza at dough and oil 
3151 2018-08-30 18:10:27 Lol. Remember back when once a year everyone would all agree not buy gas for one day to really stick it to big oil? Y'all were dumb.
3152 2018-08-30 18:10:25 I agree it can be done. I also achieved a degree without taking out a loan. However, I don't think I'm better than those that have to and that the loan corporations are vultures selling snake oil to teenagers. No one's life should be determined by wanting higher education.
3153 2018-08-30 18:10:22 Waiting to get an oil change.. this guy says: “ya my van has lot of bugs in it, and that happened in 99. You know cars made in odd numbered years have bugs in it, you know that.”                              Sir from a Nissan 09’er to a 99’er, I think that may just be your van
3154 2018-08-30 18:10:20 It's a big defeat for investment in the oil industry. This ruling should signal more than ever that Canada must move forward with greener, more dynamic and productive industries. Time to stop digging holes in the ground.
3155 2018-08-30 18:10:11 Way too go Prime minster who tip toes threw life..must be nice Alberta SCREWED YET AGAIN?I am happy for the indigenous people to get their voice FINALLYbut now my children and grandchildren who have hung on for so long(oil workers)we were farmers we are used to being ignored 2
3156 2018-08-30 18:10:10 With apologies to decent Yankee carpet bagger snake oil salesmen the everywhere.
3157 2018-08-30 18:10:05 夏とかTシャツに油のシミできるよねえ。あれ透けるからほぼ全裸みたいになるよ僕。
3158 2018-08-30 18:10:03 I need coconut oil ASAP!!!

3162 2018-08-30 18:09:42 그 사람은 헤일로나 날개 심심하면 바꾸겠네
3163 2018-08-30 18:09:41 Chilling and all I miss is oil beans and plantain... #NaijaFoodIsTheBest who dey with me on this?
3164 2018-08-30 18:09:34 Extract oil in a cartridge
3165 2018-08-30 18:09:21 Lemme make myself a nice bowl of dirt. Sip on some oil, maybe some rocks.
3166 2018-08-30 18:09:15 1941 First Newscaster -- Lowell Thomas, for Sunoco Oil 
"News" is attached to paying for eyeballs. 
2018 NOTHING CHANGED except, the market WIDENED.
Media loses its stranglehold on YOUR eyeballs, so much to choose from. Capitalism wins, media loses, NEW TRANSITION...?  3/3
3167 2018-08-30 18:09:06 Bila tengok cleansing oil biore botol purple tu rasa nak tergelak pulak 

Aku dah pelik eh kenapa baru guna sikit tapi tinggal setengah botol, sapa yg guna? Aku syak abah sebab mama macam mustahil 

Tetiba tadi abah nak basuh keta, "dik, yg ni shampoo ka?" aduhaiiii 
3168 2018-08-30 18:08:56 Qualifications for the next pope that will bear the most fruit:

-soldier who carries a mighty sword
-will tear your city down
-poet whose weapon is his word
-will slay you with his tongue
-ruler whose brow is laid in thorn
-smeared with oil like David's boy
-o lei o lai o lord
3169 2018-08-30 18:08:50 Expect rupee appreciation & DXY weakness with oil range of 65-75 by Election !
3170 2018-08-30 18:08:45 Why the USA ignores its many neighbors to the south is always baffling to me. This one even has oil, so go figure!
3171 2018-08-30 18:08:37 랭킹 1위에 대한 집념인가
3172 2018-08-30 18:08:27 Wonder how long it's going to take fellow Southerners to see this low class Yankee carpet bagger for the snake oil salesman he is. Making fools of them and laughing behind their back. Time to invest in tar and feathers. It will be a rising market when this worm turns.
3173 2018-08-30 18:08:14 syabas dan tahniah petron...lepas ni buraq oil bolih apply sekali jadi prmbrkal...
3174 2018-08-30 18:08:07 Really?! Would you like videos from my town where very large trains run through with a minimum of 150 cars carrying crude oil? Tell me, what's the global impact of such a large train and it's possible derailment next to my town and every other town along the way?
3175 2018-08-30 18:08:06 @renoomokri seriously why are you wasting your ammunition in this situation. Even the blind can understands why oga has ported. I suspect anyone will do sane after soiling your cloths/mouth with oil and pepper
3176 2018-08-30 18:07:51 This oil taking long to reach!!!
3177 2018-08-30 18:07:49 He's still pushing that snake oil.
3178 2018-08-30 18:07:27 왜 누랩을 굳이 26만까지 올렸대
3179 2018-08-30 18:07:23 When Liberal's started there were 3 pipeline projects  to move oil east and west. All three are now dead. One by  government decree, 2 strangled by reg's, 3 by reg  mismanagement, according to the court. But taxpayers did  buy the decades old transmountain pipeline. Winning
3180 2018-08-30 18:07:22 Trudeau completely revamped the NEB delaying the pipeline even more! It should have never got to the point of the feds buying it from KM. I guess the upside is he used our tax dollars in house instead of sending it overseas...oh, wait, he’s still bringing in oil from SA
3181 2018-08-30 18:07:18 قلبي ياناس 
3182 2018-08-30 18:06:54 Which do you perfer CBD oil or Gummies?
3183 2018-08-30 18:06:45 우주가 넓고 지구는 미세먼지 만하다는 사실을 깨달은것 같은 기분이야
3184 2018-08-30 18:06:41 yo @FourthRayBeauty your gel cleanser smells amazing and i love it but the BFD cleansing oil smells SO BAD i cant even use it 
3185 2018-08-30 18:06:31 Coconut oil!
3186 2018-08-30 18:06:29 Rename the room perspective to Dita 101. You may nod-affirmative that the room perspective lends itself to personify the show of on-stage Burlesque. Your nod creates the proper reverb for your Domergue oil painting.
3187 2018-08-30 18:06:29 Essential lemon oil!! Literally works like a charm
3188 2018-08-30 18:06:17 Nah. These fast food spots use rancid soybean oil to fry foods. McDonalds meat is full of corn. Absolute destruction to the circulatory system
3189 2018-08-30 18:06:12 너무 상상 이상인데
3190 2018-08-30 18:06:11 Saving land, water & major BC economies is what the celebration is about. AB pissed away a major Heritage fund, quadrupling down on oil as a 'forever plan'. That's a terrible plan. Get your economy re-directed while oil is still a major energy. Become a leader in alternatives.
3191 2018-08-30 18:06:10 Tried to send my wife an email with a link to a cannabis oil story & it appears, since I'v tried to send it 4 times each from both my business & personal email accounts, that my email service is censoring my emails!
3192 2018-08-30 18:06:08 That’s assuming they get a steady amount of oil. Then you have to take taxes into consideration. Either way, Ohio won’t discontinue fossil fuels with people offering all this money for oil found on their land.
3193 2018-08-30 18:06:05 He is going to strip this country and we the people , for everything we have, just to give more money to his buddies. Pollute the waters, cut the trees, rape the soil for more oil and take our benefits, raises, savings just for ppl who have too much now
3194 2018-08-30 18:06:05 No more oil spills foo you trippennnnn lmaoooooo
3195 2018-08-30 18:06:03 Affects thousands of oil workers who don't have a good enough education to get a decent paying job. Doesn't affect Jewish people  who have never worked a day in their life ,because they were born into money.
3196 2018-08-30 18:06:01 I’d go with beard oil and beard balm. Haha
3197 2018-08-30 18:06:00 Lo Bhai youthion Lagta Hain Dawn b biq gya Haina?
Oil pay generation jab bilkul 0 kr do gay to yahi ho ga .
3198 2018-08-30 18:05:55 We still have the existing pipeline and the existing capacity. Production continues, oil flows.

The huffing & puffing from businesses is about wanting to *expand* production to make even more money, with companies making risky bet before securing a way to get product to market.
3199 2018-08-30 18:05:52 상상이 안 가는데
3200 2018-08-30 18:05:46 خلاص بقى احنا اسفين.. قولنا مخدناش بالنا إله ولو كنت خدت بالي مكنتش هعمل كده متهونش عليا اوجعك يا غالي 
3201 2018-08-30 18:05:43 Gross. Retraitorcans biggest supporters: oil, sugar, arms, beef, coal and whatever else doom organization you can think of.
3202 2018-08-30 18:05:43 @JustinTrudeau Govt NOT greatest champions of Canada's Oil. Major screw up like this in keeping with @JustinTrudeau's philosophy of getting rid of Canada's oil. He STILL hasn't realized Canada's economy is FULLY dependent on oil products! Economic Terrorists are still Terrorists!
3203 2018-08-30 18:05:38 누랩 26만이면 벌거 벗고 다니는거 아님?

3206 2018-08-30 18:05:11 @AlbemarleCorp we would like to present a new technology that recovers Lithium from produced water from oil wells. The cost for recovery is zero, because oil recovery pays for everything. Additionally, there is a brine reservoir with lithium in it in Wyoming state that is perfect
3207 2018-08-30 18:05:09 y ecopetrol hoy no es una ganga, pero NO es burbuja. Tampoco esta sobre valorada si las condiciones del oil se mantienen. Recordar esta es ciclica.
3208 2018-08-30 18:05:04 Definitely been on the oil again
3209 2018-08-30 18:05:02 If you really cared about clean water, you'd also care about protecting our BWCA and our wild rice from copper-nickel mining and crude oil pipelines.  

(Why do I think Tom only cares about this company because of the profit possibility & not because of the environment impact?)
3210 2018-08-30 18:05:00 Ok guys what gun oil do you use?
3211 2018-08-30 18:04:38 Oh gosh! I put DD’s promptness down to an evening primrose oil capsule up my hoo-ha 
3212 2018-08-30 18:04:33 Hey guys... can you get me in for an oil change?
3213 2018-08-30 18:04:25 I might not even put a shirt back on after I take a shower. I've moved more oil than I wanna see today.
3214 2018-08-30 18:04:20 4. Protein treatments at least twice a month e.g hair mayonnaise works wonders for me.
5. Stock up on some oils like Castor Oil/Peppermint oil and Shea butter. I still love Olive oil (liquid gold )
6. Moisture is your best friend whether with water, oil or leave-in conditioner.
3215 2018-08-30 18:04:13 Yes 2 wrongs don't make a right...let me know when you have no oil based products in your life...hemp isnt ready to take on the entire manufacturing side of oil
3216 2018-08-30 18:03:58 GenMaddow:We have developed IED that only MAGAs can set off. Filled with skunk oil,Bear scat and aged coyote urine. Doesn’t kill but makes them wish they were dead. Fragile stuff to work with. Haven’t found antidote.#secondcivilwarletters

3219 2018-08-30 18:03:50 White non-college educated evangelical women are immersed in a patriarchal culture, in which they are considered subservient to men. Throw in a leaning toward authoritarianism & voila...blind loyalty to an amoral, incompetent snake oil salesman.

3221 2018-08-30 18:03:47 Never ever heard of a Government hate to see its citizens prosper as much as this Liberal Government of Justin useless Trudeau. We have oil and gas in our land and we ship  our wealth to another country !

3228 2018-08-30 18:03:15 Yes, those who are being starved deliberately by Canadian policy. When Cda lives up to its obligations fully & honourably, then it may have a leg to stand on. Where was all this oil support & the real residuals owed to the FNs for the last 70 yrs?
3229 2018-08-30 18:03:11 I gotta check with Bannon but I wonder if I can sell the strategic oil reserve to Cuba. I'll get a good price!
3230 2018-08-30 18:03:09 Good story,  doesnt change our need for oil.
3231 2018-08-30 18:03:07 Most of us here want Florida back to its beautiful self. Which means fixing the eco systems being messed up by greed, and keeping Trump and his oil off of our coasts. Tourism is the biggest industry here and we wont have an economy with dead fish everywhere.

3245 2018-08-30 18:02:05 Remember when your car almost blew up because you didn't have any oil in it?
3246 2018-08-30 18:02:05 It does after you coat them in oil and bake for a much shorter period of time.

Think of it as pre-cooking

3252 2018-08-30 18:01:31 But the current government is buying oil from the middle East and fighting local oil.  How is that any different or better?  If anything it's worse, and again... hypocritical.

3255 2018-08-30 18:01:13 Our governments budgets were made with revenues from the #TMX considered. That’s not a good sign.

A country with the 3rd largest oil reserves on the planet should be 100% energy independent. We shouldn’t be importing energy products.

Any company operating like this w/b bankrupt
3256 2018-08-30 18:01:03 You don't get it.  Since the oil and gas workers no longer have their economy, the rest of us who have nothing to do with them and don't make their wages, now have to pay the billions they used to pay in equalization payments.

Nigerian need no President anymore, we want a leader. This is really shameful to a sovereign Nation. Think!!
3261 2018-08-30 18:00:45 That would be true except people are fighting the increase in tanker traffic and oil export as a result of a pipeline. Without the pipeline in place there will be less Canadian oil exported and there will be less tanker traffic.

3268 2018-08-30 18:00:18 It’s embarassing that Canada can’t even get one pipeline built in an efficient manner. Like it or not, oil is a major part of our economy and of our country’s prosperity. This is terrible for our competitiveness especially with Libyan + South Sudanese oil edging to full cap..

- the environment
- indigenous peoples
The CPC loves:
- oil industry
- oil revenues
- selling oil to the united states

The CPC would have done the exact same or worse regarding KM.

Sorry Andy, flaccid argument you've got, as always #cdnpoli

3298 2018-08-30 17:57:14 Thanks for the heads up on another oil play. Interesting to find out which one.
3299 2018-08-30 17:57:13 Personally edibles are yummier than the oil if you don’t pill it but it’s all about your body and working on the doses like any other medicine

3309 2018-08-30 17:56:06 Edibles! Or that Samson oil stuff bc you can pill it. When we harvest I’m going to make a bunch of edibles to dose myself like a medicine bc it really helps level me out (before they put me on the floor lmao I have to work on not eating too much)
3310 2018-08-30 17:55:52 They wouldn’t have had to spend anything if people like you and groups like green peace would have let kinder Morgan build the pipeline in the first place. But let’s keep killing Canadian jobs and buying our oil from foreign countries with no environmental policies. Brilliant!
3311 2018-08-30 17:55:39 Why do some think that no pipeline will stop the oil ? It will simply come by rail. The province and FN have absolutely no control of that. You don’t have to look hard to already see the miles of tankers at the dock with the un 1001-1300 dangerous good placards.
3312 2018-08-30 17:55:39 Well my short sighted friend the only alternative to move oil is by current means...use copius amounts of fossel fuel to move minimal amounts of oil.  With a much higher risk to the environment.  Higher costs.  And ...
3313 2018-08-30 17:55:38 The Middle East continues to supply the world oil while Canada can’t get its oil to market globally or within its own country. We all lose environmentally and Canada collapses economically. Not hard to figure out.

3330 2018-08-30 17:53:45 @donnabrazile The craven backroom reinstatement of accepting $ from oil corp donors is an example of why the Dems are just the "liberal wing of the Repub. Party".  You are dinosaurs and will be extinct soon if you continue to represent the corporations and not the people!
3331 2018-08-30 17:53:40 You’re in a Twitter argument with @FullyChargedDan of @FullyChargedShw, spouting oil industry memes and asking for a good source of facts on the issue. Very funny. No argument with you on reducing car (of any type) use though, that’s a given; if a little too idealistic for all.
3332 2018-08-30 17:53:38 That’s not a threat. That’s me telling you Albertans are not as nice or adaptable as NFLDers. Oil sands will continue to be shipped west by rail. CN and CP will double their rail lines. The oil will continue to flow. But the underlying resentment will too.

3353 2018-08-30 17:51:27 Wow loads of hot chilies eh be brave n blitz em with a touch of oil and bang em in a ice cube tray for future use. ( Goggles Required)
Or hang em and dry em.
3354 2018-08-30 17:51:20 The fact that I absolutely dread going to go get an oil change like a kid dreads going to the dentist is a problem fr fr! 
3355 2018-08-30 17:51:16 To me that is the greatest failure of government in the last 40 years.  The failure to invest in an economic future and instead offer kick backs and cash hand outs for political favour.  Keeping Alberta slave to the price of oil.
3356 2018-08-30 17:51:05 Have you tried CBD oil yet?
Do you have trouble sleeping or are you looking for a more restful sleep?
Do you feel anxious?
Do you suffer from bad headaches?
Are you in pain from arthritis or sore muscles?
If you have answered yes to these questions you need to try CBD oil!
PM me!
3357 2018-08-30 17:51:02 But those CEOs already got their new yacht orders in.  And they're planning Christmas-in-Paris vacations for their extended family.  Won't you think about the CEOs' welfare?  What's next?  You'll expect their families to serve in the military during the next war for oil?
3358 2018-08-30 17:50:58 The conservatives who will gloat about the pipeline decision today are the same albertans who will whine about the oil industry.
3359 2018-08-30 17:50:26 Foodies of #Bristol: Any idea where we can buy cassia oil??? #help #foodiequestion
3360 2018-08-30 17:50:17 An important stat that the heinous GOP *conveniently* ignores is that real wages are down. Dear leader's tariff bs, Iran bs, China bs, NAFTA bs, GOP Tax Scam bs, $1T+ in new Natl Debt bs have all lead to higher interest, oil prices and inflation. Y'all are a criminal org.RICO

3363 2018-08-30 17:49:45 It will be a best scene after comeback @Brazzers and Markus will fill oil and make u squirting till the end.
3364 2018-08-30 17:49:29 Needed an oil change. Went to a dealer w/"express oil change" on their website. Showed up in person since I called twice & they never answered their phone. Couldn't fit me in &  the guy was super annoyed I even existed. Trying to give you money here! Instead I went to @LOF_Xpress
3365 2018-08-30 17:49:27 He references Teddy Roosevelt breaking up Standard Oil.
Even then, the result was several smaller PRIVATE companies.
3366 2018-08-30 17:49:21 Nothing like taking the first drink of your first ever @Snapple Straight Up Tea, expecting sweet refreshment...and it smells like stale vegetable oil. And like a horror movie character, I didn’t run, nope...I tasted it..and it tasted exactly like it smelled. #lessonlearned
3367 2018-08-30 17:49:16 油を英訳すると、なんて言うか知ってるかい?
3368 2018-08-30 17:49:08 @donnabrazile The about-face on taking money from oil interests was craven and despicable.  This is an example of why life-long Dems like me are leaving to join a truly PROGRESSIVE movement.  Say "Hi" to the Whigs!  You are about to join them on the ash heap of history.
3369 2018-08-30 17:49:08 WHY THE FUCK DOES A OIL CHANGE TAKE TWO DAMN HOURS
3370 2018-08-30 17:49:06 when ur car runs out of oil on the outskirts of London, 60 miles from home 
3371 2018-08-30 17:48:59 Alberta has always suffered through boom and bust economies based on oil prices but unlike other oil rich areas, has refused to invest in areas that would make their economy stronger without oil or reduce their economic volatility to its price per barrel.
3372 2018-08-30 17:48:53 I would think this has to do with the safety of the transportation business. No employee would be allowed to use anything with THC in it, and what guarantee do any of us have that there is none in the cannabis oil? I understand your concern, but this needs understanding.
3373 2018-08-30 17:48:44 Saraki village dn get crude oil too?
3374 2018-08-30 17:48:39 I volunteer to drown it in oil before you burn it
3375 2018-08-30 17:48:36 if the question was preceded by 'Given that global warming will create an unliveable planet for your grandchildren, and oil sands expansion will contribute to this warming, please answer the following questions:'
3376 2018-08-30 17:48:34 I'm against every taxpayer subsidiy: oil, EV's, NFLD fish workers, etc. However, in looking at EVs, which I am keen to buy, the gov't subsidies vary widely from province to province and even model to model.  As a capitalist I wish to maximize my return
3377 2018-08-30 17:48:31 To all wall St technical analyst u see a u shape pattern in oil and natural gas get ready for a rally

3380 2018-08-30 17:48:26 Frank Field, the war-mongering xenophobe, has resigned because being nasty (or during missiles and dropping bombs) is only ok when it's to brown people with oil. Criticism of genocide not allowed. Too nasty.
3381 2018-08-30 17:48:13 I can taste the peanut oil and I'm not a fan of peanuts

3388 2018-08-30 17:47:44 The federal government will not quit Trudeau will come hard and heavy now. The government does not understand or care about First Nations if that caring gets in the way and oil is big business and that's all they care about

3392 2018-08-30 17:47:06 Yes NFLD has diversified. Yes they are not in the same position now with oil reserves found off the coast and new economic endeavours. The rest of Canada carried them until they recovered. They’ve adapted. We want that opportunity too. But we want to pay for it ourselves.
3393 2018-08-30 17:47:06 When hair is wet: 

- Use oil serums after washing your hair to strengthen and replenish moisture. (OGX makes a spray oil that I love!)

- Follow up with a detangler (I love the Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Serum)

- If possible let air dry, because heat is damaging.
3394 2018-08-30 17:47:05 I love coconut oil man! It has many benefits so y’all get into it!
3395 2018-08-30 17:47:02 With all this EM mess, don't you think global oil demand is going to suffer a big hit, which can translate to a lower inflation and a softer speech by the Fed? (Talking about the short-medium term)
3396 2018-08-30 17:46:55 Sound live, ise use lil bit oil when ine using eggs lmaooo I dont use milk in my shit either.
3397 2018-08-30 17:46:53 OIL 1D 70.30 is resistance, testing NOW. This is 5th wave up completing, correction pending by next week. WHALES will want to hold price above $70 a barrel, could EXTEND bullish.

3401 2018-08-30 17:46:29 Man sure we don't know is half of what's going on ,look at venuzuala,an oil rich country where the price collapsed now their economy is spiralling out of control
3402 2018-08-30 17:46:29 Atmosphere! Grease/oil/tar etc all will eventually block up optocouplers, laser readers & exposed LEDs (eg fire alarms, etc.
But cleaning, lubrication and checking for "play" (slack) are always the first causes in these cases.

It plays "something" points to working electronics.

3404 2018-08-30 17:46:23 Labour were 80+ years in power in Scotland, they hid our oil wealth, they made us the sick man of Europe, gave us the highest mortality rate of men in Europe, the highest child poverty rates & formed a company with the Tories to screw the scots over. 
Never trust labour .... ever
3405 2018-08-30 17:46:21 At least we’ve conquered Europe, have you? No, best you’ll conquer is Asia with ur oil money.
3406 2018-08-30 17:46:19 If you don’t like oil, then don’t use it.
3407 2018-08-30 17:46:17 You know it’s getting cold when your coconut oil solidifies .
3408 2018-08-30 17:46:16 @SmackStupid to keep things running smoothly you have to keep changing parts and keep fresh oil in the vehicle..the most important part.
3409 2018-08-30 17:46:14 ... because oil company executives need private islands, too!
3410 2018-08-30 17:46:06 Oh, this kind of idiocy lives on still?!

There once was a flash strike in one of the oil co. refineries. The holiday list mentioned 'Shivaji Jayanthi.'
The Union guys were incensed that it did not say, 'Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj ji ki Punya Jayanthi,' and struck work!
3411 2018-08-30 17:46:02 I know how much the oil sector drives the engine of the Alberta economy and how important it is.  But long term should be looked at over short term financial and political gains.  In 20 years how much oil infrastructure invested in now by tax payers will be abandoned?
3412 2018-08-30 17:46:00 Just treated myself to a posh olive oil
3413 2018-08-30 17:46:00 ran out of cooking oil so thought it was a brill idea to just cook stuff with rayu instead (it wasnt) 
3414 2018-08-30 17:45:57 Given that report of Farage generously making a present of an oil painting depicting his idol dressed as Napoleon, it’s very disappointing that Steve Bannon couldn’t have made a bid. 

I guess it proves that Farage is no oil painting.
3415 2018-08-30 17:45:48 Just got my oil changed. Feels like a fresh start. Hopefully the next 5000 miles will bring more adventure than just running to the grocery store.
3416 2018-08-30 17:45:43 Eat clean  no oil, most veggies and fruits.
3417 2018-08-30 17:45:43 To them...
That oil can even cure cancer

3419 2018-08-30 17:45:27 Stop chugging olive oil! We've been over this!
3420 2018-08-30 17:45:19 Nothing is completely safe. A pipeline is far safer than truck or rail. We are slowly decreasing our need for oil but until we don’t need it, we need a safe way to get it from A to B. You’re a hypocrite. Think about that the next time you drive or buy anything plastic.

3424 2018-08-30 17:44:53 The Harper loaded NEB process was bogus. Everyone knew it was bogus, yet, the Liberals used it anyway to fast track the project. Resignations are called for. Rachel Notley is not blameless. The Oil Deep State is not all powerful.

3428 2018-08-30 17:44:38 true, next war will be for the oil on our faces:p

3431 2018-08-30 17:44:27 @Kia Attn Greg Silvestri:  Thanks for your recent letter with your offer of a $9.95 oil change.  Unfortunately I won't be able to take advantage of this offer as I drive a Kia Soul EV (you know what EV stands for don't you?).
3432 2018-08-30 17:44:20 Cooking dinner for mum and dad and having a war with oil, bacon and a frying pan is not how I want to spend the begining of my Thursday evenings.

3435 2018-08-30 17:43:57 At a time when countries are completely divesting in oil how is doubling the pipeline a long term economic solution to Alberta, its oil workers and economy?   Exponential growth is not a reality in the sector and at a certain point you face diminishing returns.
3436 2018-08-30 17:43:56 There's a body oil slider. Not even joking.
3437 2018-08-30 17:43:54 I second The Ordinary’s squalane oil!
3438 2018-08-30 17:43:40 I just don’t understand how you go to get some baby oil & deodorant and come out spending $90 on bs .
3439 2018-08-30 17:43:32 Doesn't mean they have to.  should desist depleting the worlds oil reserves and stop being so full of avarice!  That might help alleviate the worlds problems!
3440 2018-08-30 17:43:20 Spencer’s beard oil is making my chin break out. I’m about to go on strike on kissing him until he changes his product. Making me all self-conscious and look like I’m going through puberty
3441 2018-08-30 17:42:39 Look at the bigger picture. US wants to pull out of Qatar. Qatar gives kushner a big chunk of money but Saudi doest like Qatar. US gives weapons to Saudi kills people in Yemen. Turkey wants to move in Qatar. We sanction Turkey. Qatar has no protection. Trump ask for oil. ??? 
3442 2018-08-30 17:42:37 oil changes be long for no reason
3443 2018-08-30 17:42:37 Oil is the cleanest energy in the world? That's either a typo, or you're as stupid as you think JT is.
3444 2018-08-30 17:42:32 What a disgrace these judges are. Oil is the lifeblood of Canada. Instead we allow Saudi oil to be imported. Where is the sense in all this?
3445 2018-08-30 17:42:31 Coconut oil/milk.  Before and after.
3446 2018-08-30 17:42:28 I accidentally poured la croix in my essential oil diffuser this morning... peak white millennial status achieved
3447 2018-08-30 17:42:25 A table spoon of coconut oil (you can put it in tea and drink it) but helps slow down your flow and and ends your period faster.
3448 2018-08-30 17:42:24 True black seed oil (kalonji oil) is amazing for everything I use it for my skin and hair and I just have a spoonful of the seeds it’s so good for you

3454 2018-08-30 17:41:18 I know right! Had the whole yard whacked in the time it normally takes me to start my gas/oil weed eater. I’m sure my neighbors are going to be bummed they don’t get to see me cuss out and throw the old one around weekly.

3457 2018-08-30 17:41:14 Perhaps with this incredible book value loss on the pipeline the federali's will cut funding to the department of Indian Affairs proportionally to  the loss of Oil Royalties and tax revenues? Whaddya think? Or does team fucktard just take it in the nether regions again? #cdnpoli
3458 2018-08-30 17:41:09 America didn't know they were voting a deal maker w/probably the lowest level of ethics to office, in the history of US. 

1st  - w/ Corporates for tax cuts 

2nd  - w/Insurance Companies 

3rd - w/Saudis & Co for Iran Sanctions - Higher oil prices 

Rest all , go figure

3464 2018-08-30 17:40:40 That’s 1 of about 40 odd cabinet members of PTI but yeah he totally needs the sack. Don’t know why he was selected. We are done with Rana Sanaullah types
3465 2018-08-30 17:40:37 when is a Federal Court of Appeal ruling on #TransMountain based on environmental issues versus big oil a shady deal?

3473 2018-08-30 17:40:09 Wowwww. That is some attention to detail. Can we get a giant oil derrick and chain ourselves to it for our SBTB moment?
3474 2018-08-30 17:40:08 No one said it can not be built. Do you feel that we should only sell our oil to the States? If no, we need a plan b and C

3480 2018-08-30 17:39:14 Fairly stable, actually. Down only 1,7% YTD towards USD. Oil dollars...
3481 2018-08-30 17:38:56 Thorium is different. There are several youtubes on it.Different design/great safety. In Canada we need a way to replace oil/gas quickly&something storm proof. I have solar.Doesn't do much in the winter/if cloudy. We need continous outputs of energy for society to be stable.
3482 2018-08-30 17:38:55 Arabs are basically donkeys it's just the oil that made them rich but class remains cattle class
3483 2018-08-30 17:38:55 Uncertainty for oil and gas, of course.  That is a global condition.  Certainty for sustainable projects and business and that’s what we want - right?
3484 2018-08-30 17:38:53 Itu bukannya eye make up remover?

Aku sih urutannya, mw > fw > toner. Kalau pakai maskara atau make-up yg waterproof, pertamanya hapus pake make-up remover oil based.

3486 2018-08-30 17:38:28 I swear every time I get my oil changed these guys find other things wrong with my vehicle or they just like talking to me.
3487 2018-08-30 17:38:26 Blaine Higgs est-il à la retraite? Is he retired from Irving Oil?
3488 2018-08-30 17:38:25 I think it tastes better in oil
3489 2018-08-30 17:38:12 He is simply an abhorrent individual that supports terrorists and acts like an oil snake salesman in his attempts to enter no10 with his ex lover Diane Abbot! Just imagine those two in the main bedroom of no 10  He has NO scruples ! NO moral compass ! Simply disgusting!
3490 2018-08-30 17:38:06 เห็นละจ้า ตอบไปแล้ว
3491 2018-08-30 17:37:57 You won to hurt Canada on the international stage for trade of our resources. You should walk down your street that the taxpayers built.. naked. Just about every product made has a connection to oil. And you might as well quit eating and start hunting. Food is transported by oil.
3492 2018-08-30 17:37:52 And today there was justice for all those who want clean air, land and water. We have enough oil we do not need this additional pipeline at huge expense and risk.
3493 2018-08-30 17:37:47 And this pipeline was to ship oil to Asia. It has nothing to so with Canada need and supply.
3494 2018-08-30 17:37:46 @CovinoandRich Idea for game, kinda based off a previous callers idea, over or under 1 of the three of you based on questions regarding how many of you have done a certain thing. Example question..."Between Rich, Steve, & Spot, over under of 1, checked oil dipstick in last year?
3495 2018-08-30 17:37:45 Pushing for war. Saves Trump's ass, good for oil. Good biz! 
Wisdom protect us. 
Divest now.

3500 2018-08-30 17:37:32 It's too salty and they soak it in that lemon oil
3501 2018-08-30 17:37:25 my sister and i basically drowned ourselves in citronella oil, and it did nothinggggg.
3502 2018-08-30 17:37:24 You have to believe in climate change to work for an oil company.
3503 2018-08-30 17:37:17 Glad I don’t live in Saskatchewan. @PremierScottMoe would have encouraged his idiot friend @AndrewScheer to do the exact same thing. This pipeline is in the best interest of all Canadian’s. But go ahead, cheer against it moving oil Moe. #kindermorgan #pipeline
3504 2018-08-30 17:37:16 This pipeline was to ship oil to Asia. It has nothing to so with Canada need and supply.
3505 2018-08-30 17:37:12 now you’ve said the magic word: OIL
3506 2018-08-30 17:37:11 I have dry skin under my beard...it’s annoying how do I moisturize  is that what beard oil is for?
3507 2018-08-30 17:37:09 4 yrs later and my oil is finally changed
3508 2018-08-30 17:37:00 That's what my oil looks like when I'm finished. & OMG add what ever flavor I wish coconut oil to cut makes it smooth. I truely prefer watermelon & winter green. I have a mix taste like rootbeer barrels
3509 2018-08-30 17:36:54  I pretty much have you pencilled into the Championship for next season. You’ll get to see your friends Wigan, Sheffield Wednesday and others it’ll be like going to summer school with all the bad ass kids who don’t have oil money to bolster their roster.
3510 2018-08-30 17:36:51 You're a business man, Bill - you can imagine the signal this #TransMountain decision sends to international investors - #Trudeau clearly stated ensuring approval was w/in his constitutional authority b/c of 'national interest'! deal with it! #oil #energy #Alberta
3511 2018-08-30 17:36:50 Manchester city got such an easy draw in the CL... That Arab oil money working its magic.
3512 2018-08-30 17:36:50 The cover also looks very adventurous, and it will be re-wild, finally a nice hardcore porno with oil. and yes I believe it without them having fun.
3513 2018-08-30 17:36:48 This pipeline was to ship oil to Asia. It has nothing to so with Canada need and supply.
3514 2018-08-30 17:36:42 When Harper was pm we had a thriving oil and gas industry, rob you don’t have a clue. I’m not a Harper fan but he is no Trudeau.
3515 2018-08-30 17:36:25 Don't recall the famous "OPEC stairwell" ever calling (their sources) evil, socialist or market manipulators. But said Stairwell could note history & occasionally also the dubious market management prowess, motives & ability of #oil producers to act in consumers' interests#OOTT
3516 2018-08-30 17:36:16 I cover my face when I go out because I don't want USA noticing I have THIS MUCH of oil reservoirs.
3517 2018-08-30 17:36:04 Load in day at Lucas Oil Raceway - the fun starts tomorrow with the #TurboPig in Indy. 
3518 2018-08-30 17:36:00 Damn tea tree oil dries out your zits hella fast
3519 2018-08-30 17:35:57 Oil would be less than $30 and filter would be less than $10. So you’d have to average 4.5 oil changes per year to reach $180 in parts.
3520 2018-08-30 17:35:54 Did he have an environmental oil leak on his head?
3521 2018-08-30 17:35:53 As long as leeches control the oil industry, nothing will change. Im with you on our "deal" with Saudi Arabia. There's little to no difference between them and Iran's theocratic regime.
We got tech that can bankrupt Saudi Arabia in mere weeks, but those shadow bosses want  
3522 2018-08-30 17:35:44 Well it has just become like human right organisation  protecting the wrong people ,t_____r is now controlled by so called oil Arabic money the champion of human rights and ladies rights
3523 2018-08-30 17:35:43 If you think it's madness what i'm saying tell me why would a 'Muslim' group want all Muslims dead for oil? they ain't Christians they ain't Muslims they are abuse defined of religion as a scapegoat, usa IS partnered with people who did 9/11, 15/19 attackers Saudi, IRAQS FAULT!

3526 2018-08-30 17:35:15 I'm not clear if you are against taxpayer subsidy of EVs, and if you are, why you are ok with massive taxpayer subsidy of oil industry?
3527 2018-08-30 17:35:07 Alexa find image of oil field trash
3528 2018-08-30 17:35:03 If it isn’t changing your oil, you should be able to check your own fluids and top them off if necessary.
3529 2018-08-30 17:35:00 A star performer in @MartinSmart2 trial this year. Even as untreated seed in a challenging season, InV1140 from @Hutchinsons_Ag  & @WynnstayGroup  looked fantastic from establishment to harvest, delivering 46% oil.

3534 2018-08-30 17:34:38 I know that it was never in a smoker's room but was in my Mum's kitchen so may have air born condensed fat or oil from the cooking.
3535 2018-08-30 17:34:33 You should respect each other and refrain from disputes you should not, like water and oil, repel each other, but should, like milk and water, mingle together
3536 2018-08-30 17:34:31 Tumis ayam first without oil. Api slow af bagi release minyak/lemak daripada ayam tu then baru masukkan rempah, bawang etc. Continue tumis and baru masuk air. Kalau masuk air dulu, sup akan berkeladak and flavour ayam tak keluar mcm yg first tadi. Goodluck!
3537 2018-08-30 17:34:21 There's wowie in #FriendlyFarms' live liquid cannabis vape oil strain Maui. A nasal-expanding blast of hot Chinese mustard.

3542 2018-08-30 17:33:43 I have a new found love for Coconut Oil 
3543 2018-08-30 17:33:43 Just so they can continue to get oil or natural gas from Russia. Russia and Germany are in big collusion to the detriment of NATO an America.
3544 2018-08-30 17:33:43 Current trends will change. Medium to long term, oil is out.  Soonest to go will be dirty tar sands oil. Have faith my friend. We humans can do better. Canada can do better.

Hands down the best pizza in Rockland!! Had the white and margarita, the crust had a great flavor and not dripping with oil like most pizza.
3546 2018-08-30 17:33:23 I cheaped out and got bad olive oil and now everything’s less beautiful.
3547 2018-08-30 17:33:22 How is constitution not violated if a state minister disrespects other reps of state, the judicary, that convicted Qadri, victim, a governor
3548 2018-08-30 17:33:13 Panas di aku. :( enakan baby oil.
3549 2018-08-30 17:32:34 You must be high.

#Harper set the NEB process up that was found at fault.

Oil is none of what you say it is.

Even other Conservatives are throwing shade at your loopy tweets....

3552 2018-08-30 17:32:09 Thank you for interest, pre op appointment Monday coming and oil removal op = on 13th. Sight in eye at the moment very poor, some vague colours/shapes only. Nothing good to say about loss of one eye sight, overwhelming and still not used to. Could be worse..
3553 2018-08-30 17:32:04 just stopped by to say that pure rosehip oil is a fantastic moisturizer and it helps fade scars!
3554 2018-08-30 17:32:02 I am tired of the radical environmentalists and their elite pals like soros ruining our country and holding us hostage over our own oil meanwhile they are perfectly ok with dumping raw sewage in the st Lawrence and the bc coast and with Islamic fascist oil #CO2islifenotpollution
3555 2018-08-30 17:31:53 Look at our UCL group. Lmao. Where’s that anointing oil sef?
3556 2018-08-30 17:31:52 “You ain’t gonna shoot no cop in the back, you know what the give you for that ? The gas chamber, you know that the gas chamber smells like? Pine oil, that’s where you headed boy, pine oil heaven” classic
3557 2018-08-30 17:31:44 เอาจริงแค่ 5000 มันกอยากได้แหละแต่แบบถ้าซื้อนี่ต้องห้ามใจตัวเองอ่ะไไม่ซื้ออย่างอื่นเพิ่ม
3558 2018-08-30 17:31:43 She did win. A victory for every oil producing country except hers.
3559 2018-08-30 17:31:39 If you chose the right feedstock, it's win win. 

Soy and corn lobbyist were strong in both helping and hurting.

Algae for oil is still in dev.

Main point, it's not burning dead buried dinosaurs and any feedstock pulls CO2 from the air. Closed loop is better than new waste co2.
3560 2018-08-30 17:31:32 The fact is, the Chamber will say or do literally anything to put more money in the coffers of its corporate donors, with zero regard for the democratic process, environmental safety, or the public good.

GTFOH with your oil company propaganda.
3561 2018-08-30 17:31:26 Just found out you can buy a 400 lb thing of lavender essential oil for ~$35,000. What a deal.
3562 2018-08-30 17:31:25 That is great. There is a lovely olive oil plantation (?) with a shop and restaurant near Service Dogs, Inc. in Dripping Springs.
3563 2018-08-30 17:31:19 There's plenty of benefits to it. It's a better pain killer than most perscription drugs, it's been shown in studies to have adverse effects on cancer, thc oil drops stop seizures in both humans and pets. And plenty more, but the only adverse side effects about it are theory.
3564 2018-08-30 17:31:08 Federal Court ruled today the pipeline will NOT be built! Maybe @JustinTrudeau tried to convince #USA that Canada would supply crude oil by spending $4.5 Billion & it was just a gable costing Canadians!

3567 2018-08-30 17:30:51 Holy shit, it's like a fascist laundry list of ways to abuse innocent children. Yes, we should know, you oil slick of a person.
3568 2018-08-30 17:30:49 They never said deeply flawed, but shipping oil by rail is a much better alternative anyways. Jackass!
3569 2018-08-30 17:30:37 핏이 구려
3570 2018-08-30 17:30:37 Oil or this pipeline is not our entire country's economy.
3571 2018-08-30 17:30:36 Oh, and the NEB ignored the concerns that there are no customers signed up to buy oil from the pipeline. There are a lot of reasons investors and banks didn't want to get into bed with KM on this deal. It never should have been approved, no matter how you slice it.
3572 2018-08-30 17:30:35 Get rid of that idiot PM. We need a Canada strong in our resources and proud to use them instead of Saudi oil and U.S. Vote to change in next election.

You make #Soros proud.
3577 2018-08-30 17:30:17 Oil prices sky rocketed.
3578 2018-08-30 17:30:16 I had about 5 or 6 mosquito bites on my legs just from last night. I put some oregano oil on them and by the time I woke up they were gone

3580 2018-08-30 17:30:07 In context of conversations about #Nafta talks and general Canada-US trade, Bill @Bill_Morneau notes that 99% of Canadian oil exports currently go to the US.
3581 2018-08-30 17:29:56 I wish I could smell it before buying just in case I didn't like it but it does look good. I do need to stock up on balm and oil again.
3582 2018-08-30 17:29:51 Can’t believe I just paid another nigga to change my oil and filters. I’m not waiting last minute to do shit I can myself ever again

3593 2018-08-30 17:29:17 For me the optimal pumpkin  usage spectrum ranges from: pumpkin pie on the ‘great usecase’ side to pumpkin beer on the ‘id rather drink Cod Liver Oil’ side.  Everything else falls somewhere in between.
3594 2018-08-30 17:29:12 That’s that oil money 
3595 2018-08-30 17:28:57 I love it when sausages are so greasy that grilling them nearly causes an oil fire, it's really fun!!!! 
3596 2018-08-30 17:28:56 If the nos of income tax payers increased than amount of income tax must have been increased.more money to the govt.than why not tax on oil is decreasing to easy the people of the country.
3597 2018-08-30 17:28:54 you need more oil to burnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn it with fire lol

3603 2018-08-30 17:28:36 That's all on #KinderMorgan from me. Just realize this. It's the vulnerable in Canada that lost today. The ones that depend on social programs we are so proud of. The winner is #TrumpisPumped - he gets to import cheap Canadian oil while exporting US oil.

3605 2018-08-30 17:28:10 Congressional intent from 2007 on RFS is very clear and confirmed in federal court.  It was designed to force biofuels using high RIN prices if necessary.   That is the law until it is changed.   The question is whether there is ANY common ground between ag and oil for compromise
3606 2018-08-30 17:28:09 Brent has risen by almost 10 per cent over the past two weeks on widespread perceptions that the global oil market is tightening and could run short in the next few months as U.S. sanctions restrict crude exports from Iran.
3607 2018-08-30 17:27:57 Ask your Bullish snake oil sales people why the the Fed raised its IOER by 20bps instead of 25bps?... & then ask if there is any connection to that decision & bank reserves.
3608 2018-08-30 17:27:53 I know. Why was he set on the TMX when our money should go into solar, wind, tidal energies? Oil is not the answer.
3609 2018-08-30 17:27:52 Oil: : WTI eases-off 3-week tops, stays above $ 69.50.

3612 2018-08-30 17:27:33 Your article didn't mention the other reason the court failed to approved the project. NEB failed to do an impact study on oil tankers. Way to stir up race relations. Irresponsible reporting
3613 2018-08-30 17:27:27 Brent has risen by almost 10 per cent over the past two weeks on widespread perceptions that the global oil market is tightening and could run short in the next few months as U.S. sanctions restrict crude exports from Iran.

3617 2018-08-30 17:27:03 Oil prices rose on Thursday, extending gains on growing evidence of disruptions to crude supply from Iran and Venezuela and after a fall in U.S. crude inventories.

3622 2018-08-30 17:26:45 Yeah, even when Teddy Roosevelt broke up Standard Oil, the result was still separate smaller PRIVATE companies.
3623 2018-08-30 17:26:36 How our Nation is going to face the inflation...Crude Oil is been literally Speculated on Trump's " Destroy Obama Era" This will ruin Our economy like anything ..US and China is just raising the surges as they wish..what are we Going to Do to protect us @sgurumurthy @PMOIndia
3624 2018-08-30 17:26:32 For Oil, Best ran Co’s, whether the market acknowledges or not are SGY and WCP. Might not pop as hard as others but incredible well ran internally. 

GXE and BTE also worth a hard look.
3625 2018-08-30 17:26:26 Trump continuing obscene levels of military spending, his allowing oil, gas, mining and chemical industries to tear up our beautiful country, and reducing federal government commitment to clean water = all reasons to oppose this administration. @realDonaldTrump
3626 2018-08-30 17:26:21 Yet they all use oil everyday in their lives.  Again, nimbyism at its best.  I'm not saying we shouldn't have proper consultation but we need to figure what's good for the country and not just for one segment of the populations interests.
3627 2018-08-30 17:26:16 Lavender or tea tree oil and certain supplements such as Dong Quai and Tribulus terrestris have also been associated with #gynecomastia.
3628 2018-08-30 17:26:14 JT likes to support Middle East oil.
3629 2018-08-30 17:26:12 I did the calculations on how much #Sudan will be getting a day for the transportation and refinery of our oil they’ll get between $80,000 to $100,000 a day times that by 7 then 52 you’ll see why they are mediating our peace “hidden agenda” is not so secretive #SouthSudan
3630 2018-08-30 17:26:08 Rosie: any thoughts on your boss Justin’s failure of the Canadian Oil
industry once again?
3631 2018-08-30 17:26:03 Definition of hypocrisy: several times per month, foreign flagged tankers carrying Vladimir Putin’s oil continue to sail through the waters of British Columbia on their way to refineries in the great Democratic led state of Washington.
3632 2018-08-30 17:26:03 I'm guessing rubbing the linen holding rosemary on one's teeth would smear oil from the bough on them.
3633 2018-08-30 17:26:03 I wonder why @timdunntexas and the Wilks brothers would want a ton of deregulation on oil and gas? hmmmm. I just don't know. If the state is so prosperous, why are we $100 Billion in debt? Why can't we fund programs that matter to average Texans who don't own oil businesses?
3634 2018-08-30 17:26:01 Urban people rarely ever change their own oil
3635 2018-08-30 17:25:49 Oh yeah, Ted's megadonors, big oil perceive they have a lot to lose. Cruz is their lobbyist!
3636 2018-08-30 17:25:48 อยากนอนให้หลับเดี๋ยวนี้ กลัวสายยย
3637 2018-08-30 17:25:43 Even better if we use Iraqi oil as compensation for our efforts however misguided they were. Trump was right about Iraq, and the concept of controlling their oil to defeat ISIS.
3638 2018-08-30 17:25:41 Stop all revenue from oil to First Nations
3639 2018-08-30 17:25:38 Hey man time is money. I go to an Auto-Spa. It sounds douchy but they change your oil, check your fluids, and car wash for $40 + tip in my neighborhood. I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO CHANGE OIL...

3642 2018-08-30 17:25:26 have pre cooked food in fridge to reheat. E.g.  Currently in fridge:(all cooked)salmon hamburger pork loin beef roast. Low starch veggies sautéed in coconut oil and butter. Broccoli sprouts homegrown. Selection of cheeses. Cucumbers. On counter tomatoes. Raw hamburger in fridge
3643 2018-08-30 17:25:23 Not British Columbia.  We have oil and gas as well. :)
3644 2018-08-30 17:25:17 I hate Ina Garten and her “GOOD olive oil” catchphrase syndrome but I stand by what I said. Most vanilla is too icey and doesn’t have a strong enough flavor for me! I’m a total purist when it comes to some things so put a fantastic vanilla in front of me and I’ll try it
3645 2018-08-30 17:25:16 Oh, the proof is there. Mueller is getting the i's dotted and the t's crossed. It's coming like a fucking Trump Freight Train at the entire fucking crime family!!! Russian Mob, GOP complicity, Money Laundering, influence peddling, selling US policy for a cut of the oil profits...
3646 2018-08-30 17:25:12 I was at the dealership way too long for an oil change now that I think about it
3647 2018-08-30 17:25:11 Trumps love for oil and coal bothers me deeply. He reduced the rebate for buying electric cars in 1/2.
3648 2018-08-30 17:25:10 Oh boy... Yes and no. Algae biodiesel is the holy grail. Eats CO2, turns it into to oil and feed or fertilizer. Palm oil and soy? Bad for orangutans, bad for soil. Hemp is better than rapeseed and soy, co-product rocks. WVO is waste to resource, burn it hot. Bio closes co2 loop
3649 2018-08-30 17:25:10 Sous Chef: Can you make the bechamel please

Agency Chef: Yeah sure

..goes about making it the traditional way..

Sous Chef: Oh no don’t do it like that. Just blitz the flour with oil, then add it to the boiling water and milk.

Agency Chef: ... Okay....
3650 2018-08-30 17:25:05 And we’ve oil and you don’t. What are you going to do about it? Absolutely NOTHING.
3651 2018-08-30 17:25:04 Better cut them all down to reduce their carbon footprint.
3652 2018-08-30 17:25:03 Imported cars oil the  engine of Zim economy since we don't have a reliable transport system. Money spent on them is not waste.
3653 2018-08-30 17:25:02 Oil is Canada's cash cow - without oil, taxes go up and services and payments go down - if the majority is willing to accept doing with less - so be it, but this will also include the Indigenous - Mexico is set to triple production in 2 years - no pipeline - oilsands are dead
3654 2018-08-30 17:24:52 Who?? Me?? U r funny oh, when anointing oil dey and backhand slap which have been a brain resetting mechanism from 18bc
3655 2018-08-30 17:24:51 What they mean is that if push comes to shove,the US can shut China out of Middle East oil and with no oil,Chinese economy and it's rapid industrialization will stall.but should China effectively control Western Africa Oil map,the way US owns the Middle East,...
3656 2018-08-30 17:24:47 What about coconut oil in cosmetic products? I see a lot of clean #beauty products that contain it.
3657 2018-08-30 17:24:43 So owning a pickup with a Viper V10 is all fine and well, except when they claim that because its a Viper the act of changing the oil some how cost more.

3661 2018-08-30 17:24:28 Yes! And it’s so sad when moms try to use castor oil at 37 weeks  I mean castor oil in general is AWFUL, but so early!! Your babies lungs aren’t fully developed at 37 weeks, every day in there counts  
3662 2018-08-30 17:24:26 Tea tree oil galing sa face shop ate. Medyo pricey pero literal na worth it. Makikita mo tlga ung result in just a few days.

3664 2018-08-30 17:24:21 This is truly worth a FFS.  Our PM with a newfound oil fetish has now burnt billions of taxpayer funds on a go nowhere project.
Ooops i guess thats why you leave risk to the private sector.

There will be no wailing about tax payer funds from the propipeline groups. Hypocritical.
3665 2018-08-30 17:24:20 I was talking to the oil fan
3666 2018-08-30 17:24:15 กรอก+โอนแล้วเรียบร้อย แล้วฝากจดหมายยังไงอ่ะคะ
3667 2018-08-30 17:24:13 It ain't what you oil, it's the way that you oil it...?
3668 2018-08-30 17:24:12 Setting powder ....I feel is OK . It absorbed more of the oil and makes the finished work sets better . Not really a fan of the spray.
3669 2018-08-30 17:24:10 Huge win for the USA interests now NAFTA will go ahead without any concessions from Quebec we Canadians are screwed by the oil companies from the USA
3670 2018-08-30 17:24:05 Why are people lubing their chain with motor oil...why... #bikelife #bikeshop #atx #bmx #ruff
3671 2018-08-30 17:24:02 ฉันก็งงว่าตรงข้ามมันโล่งโจ้งขนาดนั้นบ้านแกจะอยู่ตรงไหนวะ 5555555
3672 2018-08-30 17:24:02 Yea, the indigenous people have the "power" to use "settler" tax money, along with US oil money, to appeal projects using the "settler" judicial systems.
OK .....
3673 2018-08-30 17:23:57 The Loan Ban out of Cali is as of yesterday... These ain't talking points, and I don't work for any company involved in this debate. I'm a guy who just is realistic, and desperately want to see the oil sands shut down. Who wants the environment protected... Jeez.
3674 2018-08-30 17:23:46 The secret to happiness is to see all the marvels of the world, and never to forget the drops of oil on the spoon.
3675 2018-08-30 17:23:35 Thanks!

3678 2018-08-30 17:23:26 look how town man going and get south gyal easy now... no more oil money
3679 2018-08-30 17:23:24 @KevinRothWx told me I could totally trust the farmers almanac. Are you telling me I shouldn’t have invested it all in heating oil?
3680 2018-08-30 17:23:24 Are Oil Companies really to blame for the pollution, or is Edani using them as a scapegoat?
3681 2018-08-30 17:23:23 @PiyushGoyal @RailMinIndia I was wondering if you give #discounts or partial #refunds on #rail fare if you are unable to provide #hygienic bed sheets and pillow cover. PNR: 8309350269...My bedsheets are full of oil stains and smell...
3682 2018-08-30 17:23:18 This has everything to do with leftists not wanting to understand how safe pipelines really are compared to any other method of oil transport. Also those same people not realizing there are pipelines just like this in existence already, this is just one more line
3683 2018-08-30 17:23:16 Hate to be this person (sorry in advance!) but I’m allergic to nuts. If I leave them out, do I adjust the amount of oil/cheese/etc accordingly?

3685 2018-08-30 17:23:01 I need an oil change and I need to change my filters on my car ..  replace my other set of brakes and buy more tires .. soon.
3686 2018-08-30 17:22:51 And forcing Europe to kowtow to it.the US effectively owns Middle East oil map. This leaves Western Africa.China and India needs energy resources in large quantities. Thus, when it is written that China in Africa is a threat to the US security interests,...
3687 2018-08-30 17:22:45 Oh it says "crude oil" not "bitcoin"

3693 2018-08-30 17:22:06 I do oil changes and rotates on customer cars and get paid as much as someone who works at tbell like god damn I could kill someone not doing my job right like oops forgot to tighten your wheels down oops but I’d give a shit if I got paid what I should which is 19 an hour lol
3694 2018-08-30 17:22:02 Subsidy ended in 2011 (aka VEETC) and was paid to those that blended ethanol & gasoline. That was typically oil companies, rarely ethanol companies.
3695 2018-08-30 17:22:02 If it wasn’t for oil you’re team would still be in the Championship so pipe down mate
3696 2018-08-30 17:22:01 They had to bail out thier oil crony friends

3700 2018-08-30 17:21:45 Coconut oil is the answer to everything
3701 2018-08-30 17:21:43 Thank you Andrew - Tories have always been champions of the environment! You do know that pipelines carry oil? Is that the "cleanest, most ethical, environmentally friendly" energy about which you rhapsodize? You're delusional.
3702 2018-08-30 17:21:16 Well if we could just keep our oil in the country, refine it in the country, and sell it across the country...we wouldn’t need to send it across oceans to sell  - but you go ahead and support that Saudi and USA oil, not like they don’t treat us right 
3703 2018-08-30 17:21:14 They can cause 0 leaks, due to lack of oil. Pollutuon prevention.
3704 2018-08-30 17:21:08 Taking care of yourself feels good nehsat here and plaited my afro, coconut oil ereng... Ke nwa green tea, ke warm. 
3705 2018-08-30 17:20:50 The most environmentally-friendly  energy in the world is....oil? 

Jesus, at least Harper was smart.
3706 2018-08-30 17:20:38 Completely wrong. Tar sands oil is  the dirtiest oil in the world and pipelines have caused oil leaks hundreds of times. Google it.

3709 2018-08-30 17:20:12 You should read up this books "The Prize" and "the seven sisters"..Understand that there are Three major oil and gas maps in the world. Western Africa,Middle East, and Russia.This places are strategic interest of power relations.see how Russia is using it's own to evade sanctions
3710 2018-08-30 17:20:06 poor people exploited with those interest rates...dreadful.

3713 2018-08-30 17:19:34 Solar welders are a possible figured out so many ways to save gas or oil while using electric, from transportation to machinery, then you loose less resources while drilling for. Inter grade the tech and convert over slowly for those who don’t hop. Using gas to harvest fuel 
3714 2018-08-30 17:19:33 add oil
3715 2018-08-30 17:19:33 @CKNW: Meanwhile, benign foreign flagged tankers carrying Vladimir Putin’s oil continue to sail through the waters of British Columbia on their way to refineries in the great Democratic led state of Washington.
3716 2018-08-30 17:19:27 Trying to be productive with my day. Got my tabs for my impala, currently getting an oil change, and then get my eyebrows threaded before work.
3717 2018-08-30 17:19:27 Yes, I'm from Alberta but I don't work with anything to do with the oil industry, I pick grocery orders, but I'm still hit hard by this, everyone is.  I have a job, but without our main industry, the rest of us have to pay up to keep services running, taxes are up
3718 2018-08-30 17:19:26 Serves 'em right!
3719 2018-08-30 17:19:12 Anointing for correction:Psalm 141:5(AMP) Let the righteous man smite and correct me—it is a kindness. Oil so choice let not my head refuse or discourage; for even in their evils or calamities shall my prayer continue.

3723 2018-08-30 17:18:56 You’d rather the oil be transported via truck or rail? A pipeline is the safest and most efficient way. You use oil products every day. Don’t be a hypocrite.

3726 2018-08-30 17:18:38 Best to buy oil and gas companies that operate outside of Canada: Vermillon is Canadian but most holdings not in Canada! #Sad
3727 2018-08-30 17:18:02 Picking up on Women shooting their shot is really wild; could turn out really good or you could get swerved heavy pulling up to her crib in a trench coat with nothing else but baby oil and timbs on smh be safe out there
3728 2018-08-30 17:17:26 Well exactly. As I've said many times prior. If you are for, or against, both sides must agree that the length and cost of this process is unacceptable. 6 months would be nice. 1 year would be maximum. Until that's fixed, why would anyone invest here? (except oil by rail!)
3729 2018-08-30 17:17:13 "English" companies? Name an "English" oil company. Low price? No, Brent crude is at $77.47 right now. Running out? Huge new finds in the last year. 
Why lie? Oh you're a tory! That explains it.
3730 2018-08-30 17:17:05 so let's keep supporting S.A. oil? We can add a safe pipeline while making a smoother transition to renewables...pretty sure the planet won't be oil free in next 20 years.
3731 2018-08-30 17:16:49 Thorium Nuclear reactors to replace oil and gas.
3732 2018-08-30 17:16:47 Human rights,  What would Saudi Arabia know about human rights.  Just talking about starting democracy can get your head cut off.  All of the nations oil wealth is essentially owned by one family.  Have you never said sorry to someone, not because ....
3733 2018-08-30 17:16:39 I'm in agreement. I have for most of my life. However, we cannot just shut down the entire oil industry in Canada. Eg: California is trying to shut down the fast credit loan industry in their state. That's not going well....
3734 2018-08-30 17:16:30 Adulting is when getting an oil change counts as your birthday present
3735 2018-08-30 17:16:30 is anyone really surprised that Trudeau would find a way to kill trans mountain and ensure Canada's dependence on Saudi oil
3736 2018-08-30 17:16:18 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.

3741 2018-08-30 17:15:39 Now is the time to revisit our partnership with the us who bye the way is trying to destroy us and start refining our own oil and sell it on the market 10% less then the Us and Saudi Arabia

3746 2018-08-30 17:15:20 when i cook i put olive oil & pepper on near enough EVERYTHING lmao
3747 2018-08-30 17:15:18 Yeah, I wasted 14 attempts [rip oil lol] thinking I just had to try and close the game to get it to work. Finally gave up, and went upstairs to prepare for church day, and saw it on a grave. Did it, went down for another, it popped up on another grave.
3748 2018-08-30 17:15:14 Soak up the oil and flavor 
3749 2018-08-30 17:15:12 So if it was not done since 1963 when we've had several oil boom and it was done now when we earn less, don't u think the administration who did it deserves some accolades ?

3751 2018-08-30 17:14:54 One way high oil prices are good , it’s a deterrent for more vehicle growth, if we can ban cars and bikes for 5 years , it’s worth reducing oil prices , otherwise No

3757 2018-08-30 17:14:28 Kindly mix Charcoal and coconut oil together.... U will be more darker
3758 2018-08-30 17:14:22 @SsssamanthaaMUA mix water and a few drops of peppermint oil in a spray bottle amd spray that shit around your house like febreeze. it helps sooo much with getting rid of spiders and its safe for the doggies 
3759 2018-08-30 17:14:20 My car is a smooth running machine. You know what I change most often? The oil. Not the transmission, not the driveshaft or the engine. If major parts need changing then its obviously not smooth running...Maybe it’s time for a new mechanic.
3760 2018-08-30 17:14:13 I can help, I only charge $5.99 for each drop of oil I put in the oil compartment

3762 2018-08-30 17:14:02 Man, I love #take5 oil change.
Checked tires, got oil changed, fluids checked and topped, wipers cleaned.
 Got it all done in 15 min- plus I got a free drink! 
And it didn't hurt the friggin wallet.

3765 2018-08-30 17:13:45 Having pipelines actually reduces Canada’s emissions by about 6-7%. Sure let’s just move it by rail. April was a record month of oil by rail transport. That record will be broken month after month now. Farmers will have not get rail space now because of decisions like this.
3766 2018-08-30 17:13:43 Exactly 
Sorry was cooking an eating. Yeah i work a lot with oil when i cook and i do the same.
3767 2018-08-30 17:13:24 me: *boot stomps gas pedal, goes 70-90mph everywhere I go, ignores change oil warning and check engine light religiously*
also me: wow my car gets such bad gas mileage wtf
3768 2018-08-30 17:13:19 Top of the hour: OIL 1H follow through higher, volatility OFF. 
NATGAS 1H bearish momentum from EIA ends, support above 50MA firms up, bullish tomorrow.
USD 1H pauses higher, bullish pending.
GOLD 1H 200MA becomes pivot, well above 1D 20MA, holding bull reversal.
SPX holds bull.
3769 2018-08-30 17:13:17 Not only undermining  the WTO. The most imbecile US President ever in history,is also responsible for the spike in prices of Crude oil, due to sanctions imposed on Iran & the attendant sabre rattling. This, unwarranted spike is hurting d poor in third world. He is an evil sadist.
3770 2018-08-30 17:13:13 shaving with baby oil is all fun and games until it turns the shower into a slip and slide and i bust my ass not once but TWICE 
3771 2018-08-30 17:13:11 Realistically, we can't go cold turkey on oil now. Cutting off Alberta oil just hurts the Canadian economy. As it now stands, if the oil isn't coming from Alberta, it'll just be imported in from other countries instead.
3772 2018-08-30 17:13:05 People calling his products Snake Oil is MSM's fake news, Nascent Iodine, Selenium,Whey protein,Bone broth, Ect. made from the best ingredients that meet of exceed California standards. Almost everyone is low on Iodine unless you take a supplement.
3773 2018-08-30 17:13:03 Gas is directly tied to your attacking the MidEast throughout Obama's tenure. Intentionally killing the frack oil industry and the Saudis steady output while harming the Russian ruble tends to backfire with price increases.
3774 2018-08-30 17:12:48 Production could have at least gave him some oil instead of this lotion 
3775 2018-08-30 17:12:32 Maybe it was the penetration oil you were carrying 
3776 2018-08-30 17:12:31 ماكانت اهم من مكة المكرمة!!!!!!!
3777 2018-08-30 17:12:24 I actually love typical British holidays, using oil instead of cream to come back as dark as possible, all inclusive booze getting the arse kicked out it and buying crappy fakes down the strip. Paradise.
3778 2018-08-30 17:12:23 The oil industry is being killed off. Doomed.
3779 2018-08-30 17:12:19 Ones of those mini glow sticks for sounding and baby oil for lube. Also I think I used a courgette for a dildo.

3796 2018-08-30 17:10:05 CPG had a quadruple breakdown on the point and figure chart, which is rare and significant. Now it made a perfect good bye kiss to the former rock bottom resistance 6.5 to the downside, which is now resistance to the upside. If oil is down, CPG is down more.

3811 2018-08-30 17:08:52 Another possible strategy (spitballing here) would be to eat lean meats for your first meal of the day to maximize the amount of protein you can eat before reaching satiety, then butter/oil/fatty meats for the second meal to get your essential fatty acids/fuel.

3830 2018-08-30 17:07:00 No, there are not. Few at all, almost exclusively funded by big oil and they are far outnumbered by the opposing position. We won't have an economy to care about if we don't deal with climate change

3835 2018-08-30 17:06:31 So you are good with Canada and the world using more and more oil from the Middle East? Explain how the environmental is better? Canada has the most environmentally friendly oil in the world. Not only that pipelines are the safest means of transport.

3837 2018-08-30 17:06:14 Even getting his "discount" by kissing up to oil companies and eliminating everything "green" that has been established in the province... one thing he might not know is, by the time that "discount" comes in... it won't be any good for the consumer...
3838 2018-08-30 17:06:12 @WilliamShatner Isn’t it about time you changed your oil?
3839 2018-08-30 17:06:08 There's plenty of cleaner oil around the world to get us through a transition period... Believe me, I never asked JT for it either. Who did? (please, no ethical oil arguments - btdt)
3840 2018-08-30 17:06:06 We should focus on funding education in a sustainable way, not off the boom and bust cycles of oil and gas. The Uinta Basin knows the pains of theses cycles better than most. Energy resources won’t last, then what?
3841 2018-08-30 17:06:05 And lose even more billions by selling our oil at hugely discounted prices.
3842 2018-08-30 17:06:03 It’s time to prove that effort and commitment worth more than oil money.
3843 2018-08-30 17:05:56 You can get minced onions/garlic too. It’s just more expensive out here and minced usually means they come in a brine or oil solution in the jar
3844 2018-08-30 17:05:53 No dispenser for brass hand oil either!
3845 2018-08-30 17:05:48 If a car had as many major parts constantly being changed as your White House, no amount of oil keeps it from being considered a “lemon”.  No wonder the country has a sour taste in its mouth. #BrokenMachine #LockThemUp
3846 2018-08-30 17:05:47 You do realize that making carbon free infrastructure will involve creating a lot of jobs right?
Not to mention, the whole environmental warming thing.  And the whole no-more-oil-in-the-ground thing.
3847 2018-08-30 17:05:38 yeah its a strength thing too some brands are more concentrated. I use a CBD oil over the tinctures :)

3855 2018-08-30 17:05:08 I guess our courts must feel that buying oil from Saudi Arabia where women have few rights is better than supporting our own country?! And of course we all know that there is no environmental footprint shipping oil from Saudi Arabia to Eastern Canada. What a crock!

3859 2018-08-30 17:04:53 Thats ridiculous and BS! Extracting Tarsands oil is very bad for environment and the risk of a diluted bitumen spill on coastal waters is too great. Cost benefit analysis not infavour of expanding the pipeline!

3887 2018-08-30 17:02:20 .. and the product isn't depleted, price is determined by supply which is affected when Big Oil stops the pumps to drive up profits by creating scarcity. There's plenty of product and it's renewable. I'd like to continue but it past bedtime.

3889 2018-08-30 17:02:12 Same, I used olive oil warmed in the microwave
3890 2018-08-30 17:02:06 That way you could bring the basic supplies (olive oil & some coconut oil) and whatever EO you want. And we could make a batch each (I would supply the rest of the stuff). Then either you could take it home to cure or I could cure it for you
3891 2018-08-30 17:02:06 I still find it difficult to understand why some Nigerians pronounce OIL As OIYEL 
3892 2018-08-30 17:02:02 It was Trudeau that killed Energy East which could have fully replaced Saudi oil. Scheer wants to revive it.
Also, Saudi oil is not subject to a carbon tax, while Trudeau changed regs to make EE responsible for both upstream and downstream CO2. 
Just a couple of examples.

3894 2018-08-30 17:01:56 speaking of which...Now I remembered I have to take my car in for an oil change..

Thanks, Bob!
3895 2018-08-30 17:01:53 Literally if your oil change at upwards of $130 your vehicle is prior to 2015. Especially Chevys cuz they changed from 5 to 6 to 8 quarts. And standard $29.99 is 5 quarts. Hahaha
3896 2018-08-30 17:01:45 Never eat margarine....never eat vegetable oil....never eat factory made cereal.....simple food...
Home made fresh food is safest....ghee is best
3897 2018-08-30 17:01:44 I'm at Costco and I kid you not. Every single shopping cart that looks like a "healthy" plant based diet shopper also has half the cart fillied with toilet paper. LMAO.

3899 2018-08-30 17:01:34 We have started.  Change is coming. But in this particular case the hypocracy is blinding.  Oil is being moved by rail and trucks, far more damaging and risky to the environment. Your comparison was lazy.  Using fuel fuels is a requirement today, and will be for years.
3900 2018-08-30 17:01:34 U start. Phone ur ulility company to disconnect u from oil. Sell ur car. No soap. Grow ur own food cause u knw how it gets to ur store. Then grow a brain before tweeting

3902 2018-08-30 17:01:29 When I used to do henna and indigo I found that xanthan gum stopped all the leaks. Just a teaspoon or so in your powder before you mix it. It’s a completely safe food thickener (I use it to make thick salad dressing without oil).
3903 2018-08-30 17:01:29 Oil money c*nts
3904 2018-08-30 17:01:22 Bitumen Tar sands oil is in your words " is the cleanest, most ethical, environmentally friendly energy?" In fact, Mr Scheer, it is anything but what you claim. Panels over pipelines. If not now when?
3905 2018-08-30 17:01:22 I’m not opposed to clean energy, not sure how anyone could be.  Near term the world will still need oil. For that Kinder Morgan never asked the government for a dime
3906 2018-08-30 17:01:19 A  big refinery build would require at least 1 or more of the following: A. AB to have direct access to coastline; B. Massive, massive public subsidies; C. A dramatic decline in the cost of labour for skilled tradespeople; or D. A big shift in the global demand for oil #ableg

3910 2018-08-30 17:01:06 My primitive understanding of what went wrong in Venezuela is mismanagement of oil + natural resources (nepotistic hirings in gov agencies, etc.), while funding programs on bet that prices would keep rising exponentially. Am I missing something? Easier to just shout "SOCIALISM"?

3917 2018-08-30 17:00:47 Our government is such a joke like y’all are gonna charge the public with a carbon tax and cancel pipelines that would help make Canada self sustainable... Instead y’all rather block that and depend on the fucked up Middle East for oil... I AM CONFUSION

3924 2018-08-30 17:00:22 with a divided working class movement on this-and add on the oil companies protecting their assets and profit margins under the gaze of jobs - was predictable the government would choose waste and fighting over transition.

3931 2018-08-30 16:59:53 Talk about gouging!  I will not travel during holidays because this gouging goes on.  Oil is a mere $66.00 a barrel.  No reason for gas to be so high, except crass greed.

3936 2018-08-30 16:59:45 They have turned politics to family biz. Father is president. Son is VP. Wife family is the minister of petroleum.

3948 2018-08-30 16:58:54 Sad day for all Canadians. Today less money will be going into health care, education, infrastructure, & social programs.

We lose $43 million per day in unrealized revenue due the constraints on getting our oil to market. Think of what that money would do.

#TMX #TransMountain
3949 2018-08-30 16:58:50 Olive oil. I did not really use lotion or vasiline when I was 13 so I did not know of other alternatives 
3950 2018-08-30 16:58:47 I grasp why JGB's are not real. That's an easy one. But why is gold not a real market? Is not gold traded freely w/o manipulation? Or is it simply gold, unlike oil, has little usefulness?
3951 2018-08-30 16:58:47 Not really, the alternative to the pipeline is far riskier to the coast. By ignoring the alternatives you can come up with those fanciful claims but when all is included the foreign tankers and oil-by-rail put the Salish Sea at greater risk.
3952 2018-08-30 16:58:46 Time to cut off the gravey train and tie all native funding to oil and gas revenues.
3953 2018-08-30 16:58:45 Now we get to pay 4.5 billion dollars of our taxes to a Texas oil company! What's wrong with our governments! We pay our taxes to rich oil companies while our infrastructure suffers! Who is pulling the strings of the Libs and Cons?
3954 2018-08-30 16:58:44 Marine tankers already go through Canadian waters every day without any incident. 
Our oil transport regulations are STRICTER than what the @epa requires, not to mention those of other oil producers like Iran, Russia, and Venezuela...
3955 2018-08-30 16:58:39 It's a constant struggle. One of my friends told me just today about using real aloe vera, ginger and your fav oil (like almond etc) she blends it and put it on her hair. 
Imma do some research
3956 2018-08-30 16:58:34 I need middle eastern oil money at my club.
3957 2018-08-30 16:58:29 Yeah! More oil from the Middle East!
3958 2018-08-30 16:58:14 Poor poor Kenney and his oil buddies.  So sad, too bad.
3959 2018-08-30 16:58:12 But who buys fuel and plastic and everything else oil? You. It's not the corporations, you socialist hypocrites. It's you. And me, too. But I'm a "denier" so I don't care.
3960 2018-08-30 16:58:03 Another blow to Canadian #TarSands From Maine.

#IndigenousLeadership #cdnpoli
3961 2018-08-30 16:58:00 What a fcuking joke this country has become. But oh well let’s continue to import oil from countries that don’t give a flying fcuk about human rights or climate change. At least there’s buck a beer here in Ontario. Cheers 
3962 2018-08-30 16:58:00 That is what I do on a normal day. I don't have to use a foundation at all, and it's very, very light for my skin though I will get some oil shine, but that can be fixed with some powder throughout the day.
3963 2018-08-30 16:57:58 Hahaha or all those tree huggers ... they don’t even know that their canoes are made from oil. Or the food they eat contains oil. Yes, idiocy is on full display. Liberals continue to sing and dance and some people continue to watch this shit show and support it. Enough already!
3964 2018-08-30 16:57:48 Trudeau and the libtard party are out to destroy the oil industry in Canada,funded by foreign companies
3965 2018-08-30 16:57:43 The oil companies who employ tens of thousands of Canadians?
3966 2018-08-30 16:57:37 Step 1: find oil.
3967 2018-08-30 16:57:35 That's fine, but can we talk about people who need to buy a bottle of premixed olive oil and vinegar? "I love this flavor! I wish I knew the recipe!"

3969 2018-08-30 16:57:27 I was simply replying because it was more than oil in desert storm. They were trying to invade Kuwait. They were trying to wipe out tribes of their own people. That's called genocide. Desert storm was early 90s and Osama wasn't a huge threat then. Hell Clinton had his....
3970 2018-08-30 16:57:27 Then get some sriracha or smoked BBQ (1/3) + Honey (2/3) + teaspoon of rice vinegar + teaspoon of olive oil... Mix the solution and then dip the wings until they are dripping wet with the sauce... 

And then enjoy... 

Woolworths is obviously your ingredient plug...

3972 2018-08-30 16:57:14 If you think that oil are down and out before season has even started, on team with great talent, more depth, more health, more youth, coaching staff shake up, coming off a bizarre year entered into as a favorite...... I don''t even have the words.
3973 2018-08-30 16:57:00 Now cut any oil and gas use on these reserves.
3974 2018-08-30 16:56:59 Coconut oil 
3975 2018-08-30 16:56:50 Apparently one reason that Trans Mountain pipeline was stalled by the courts was NEB didn't take into account the marine risk of tanker travel. Really? Then we should see a fast track of Energy East to stop Saudi Arabia tankers & their conflict oil. #cdnpoli #skpoli #abpoli
3976 2018-08-30 16:56:47 I’m so glad we can now transport oil safe fully on the highways and via trains because that’s safer than pipelines.  Except it isn’t.
3977 2018-08-30 16:56:41 Harper struggled with the same thing,for me it is a failure on part of May not realizing that we need this revenue in order to go green. So now there will just be more trucks going through BC carrying oil. She could have worked with Indigenous and Trudeau instead of protesting.
3978 2018-08-30 16:56:39 The law is all messed up. Its legal to sell cigarettes that gives you cancer and its illegal to buy cannabis and cannabis oil that cures cancer and brain rumours. Starve yourself if you have a brain tumour or cancer and take cannabis oil and it cures you.
3979 2018-08-30 16:56:27 Ploughing fields for almonds then shipping them on slowboats burning dirty fuel oil is loads worse than taking milk from a cow that grazed on pasture one mile away.

3981 2018-08-30 16:56:20 Dude I got a synthetic oil change and it lasted half as long as a regular one and they told me it would last twice as long....... I almost broke my car driving around with no oil
3982 2018-08-30 16:56:17 How does one expect to reduce purchases of dirty conflict oil from countries like Venezuela and Saudi with terrible human rights records? Shipped across the oceans, two or three tankers or more  a day to Canada...
3983 2018-08-30 16:56:12 I think I needa get a oil change tomorrow too..
3984 2018-08-30 16:56:08 America has pipelines yet the gulf of mexico is just fine. 
They are SAFER than transporting oil by rail which is the alternative to pipelines (not to mention rail clogs traffic...)
3985 2018-08-30 16:56:05 Oil Can is slated to pitch an inning in relief. The  one week I'm out of town...
3986 2018-08-30 16:55:58 Well those of us who have done the extra work can assure you that the Canadian alternative was much safer than foreign-flagged tankers and oil-by-rail. Assuming the proponent includes the alternatives in their assessment they will come to the same conclusion 1/
3987 2018-08-30 16:55:56 Tbh group A would be nice
So much football culture and no oil money & plastic
3988 2018-08-30 16:55:52 delhi govt is providing cheap oil as compare to other state that means he is taking less then by other state
3989 2018-08-30 16:55:45 I do actual butter and a bit of coconut oil. I'm probably slowly killing myself I don't even know anymore, but it tastes great.
3990 2018-08-30 16:55:36 Trudeau and the libtard party have been hijacked by the green gangsters,funded by foreign companies whom are out to destroy the Canadian oil industries

3992 2018-08-30 16:55:20 Hear ya! #TeamNoSleep my son has a heart condition so keeping him safe from germs at daycare is so scary to me! I have been using an oil for immune on him (seems to be working) & for myself I have used Airborne (may want to check w dr 1st if u r breakfeeding)
3993 2018-08-30 16:55:17 Cooking videos make cooking with oil seem so easy breezy beautiful, when in reality it’s a lot of jumping away from the stove and 2nd degree burns.
3994 2018-08-30 16:55:14 It’s EVERYWHERE and pushed and pushed. I’d look like an oil slick. I can barely wear eyeshadow with any sparkliness.
3995 2018-08-30 16:55:12 Been sitting in this waiting room waiting for my oil change for 2 hours tf
3996 2018-08-30 16:55:02 Actually wind and solar are a lot more detrimental to the environment.
And he meant "OIL".
3997 2018-08-30 16:54:57 any nigga out there tryna sell you CBD oil to "get high" either ignorant about psychoactive cannabinoids or a fuckin con artist
3998 2018-08-30 16:54:48 And add to this the crumbling rupee, building pressure on modi against Iranian oil and Russian S400s..
3999 2018-08-30 16:54:34 Actually he is spending his time speaking with average Albertans. Most of who work for, or are directly/indirectly impacted by, the oil industry.  No shame here, we all enjoy a high standard of living as a result.  Your a lost cause Brad.
4000 2018-08-30 16:54:34 he's says wearing clothes and shoes made from oil products......
4001 2018-08-30 16:54:29 @72TraThomas @shandershow - you're draining all the flavor and nutrients out of the peanut butter when you pour off the oil. The bottom of the jar is going to be terrible. All you have to do is stir the damn peanut butter!
4002 2018-08-30 16:54:26 Oo hehehe. Boleh tak suggest produk himalaya utk kulit acne prone/oily skin? Btw, skrg saye pakai himalaya neem face wash dgn oil free gel cream. Memang superbb! Dah nak dekat setahun. Memang jatuh hati gila rasa sbb cuba skali, takde bad effect pun kat muka. Alhamdulillah.
4003 2018-08-30 16:54:23 Saw @GarciaDoherty in town before. Good to see him, but disappointed by his refusal to wear Patchouli oil and an ankle length RAF coat. @doughboy1967 have a word
4004 2018-08-30 16:54:20 If you contact The Fox Project they will tell you if you fall in their area. If you are going down that route it might me a good idea to start feeding it so it gets used to coming into your garden. You could give it garlic oil and 1 arnica tablet meantime.
4005 2018-08-30 16:54:10 It costs 21K$ to change the oil in a Bugatti Veyron 
4006 2018-08-30 16:54:02 Wigs , cornrows and Oil ! That’s my routine
4007 2018-08-30 16:53:59 Derail the Indian gravey train. Tie all future funding to oil revenue!.
4008 2018-08-30 16:53:44 tea tree oil really helps with that!! i put it on like once a week or so just as a precaution
4009 2018-08-30 16:53:42 How do you ship gasoline without pipelines, and do you think it's safer?
Also, heavy oil generates more product.
Do you really want tankers filled with gasoline sailing the seas?
4010 2018-08-30 16:53:38 Good to know. Ongoing research we’re conducting on connectedness in cross-rates and FX rate forecasting are exhibiting behavior that supports that claim. The rates adjust but seem to be sticky in oil price models for commodity currencies. The fundamentals are clearly awry
4011 2018-08-30 16:53:35 Oil exports represent only less than 20% of the Venezuelan GDP (contrary to widespread belief). Venezuela can win the challenge for productive diversification and compensate a part of that 20% with agriculture, industry, services, becoming less dependant on imports
4012 2018-08-30 16:53:33 I don’t want to work today. I still need to get an oil change, workout and take my comforter to the cleaners. Adulting is wild trash. It’s almost like you lose hours in the day post 25. Lol
4013 2018-08-30 16:53:26 I need some calming oil. Who has got time for "Configuration of Windows updates" please??????
4014 2018-08-30 16:53:03 top thing that freaks me out is, you never truely know someone. They could be your bestfriend or what have you but next thing ya know you’re in an oil barrel chopped into little pieces.

4020 2018-08-30 16:52:52 The US has no interest in Syria other than its oil, which US wants a 20% cut of. It's always about the oil.
4021 2018-08-30 16:52:52 GREED, here & abroad, is always the enemy of Democracy.  What hawks vaguely call “American interests” has typically meant American profits.  Seize the oil, or at least prop up despots who sell us the oil.  First on our “defense” checklist must be: defend the side of the people!

We are watching  witnesses trying  to mix oil with water
4024 2018-08-30 16:52:37 Oil fc buying the group draw for man city 
4025 2018-08-30 16:52:35 Oil from your hair will get onto your pillowcase as you sleep, so change your pillowcases weekly to avoid sleeping on oil all night long.
4026 2018-08-30 16:52:23 @shandershow you have to invert the jar so that when you flip it to open the jar it mixes the oil in #NaturalPB
4027 2018-08-30 16:52:14 oil is still flowing through that pipeline which means oil companies are still paying, expansion is stalled 
4028 2018-08-30 16:52:10 We need to move our oil, as safe as possible and this stopping it isn’t helping anyone in Canada...we need to get it to ports and it to different countries so our oil will be worth what it’s worth in the world market
4029 2018-08-30 16:52:01 I noticed sesame oil is in it, which can be a serious allergen. Is she allergic to sesame seeds maybe?
4030 2018-08-30 16:51:59 Is there an essential oil that cures type 1 diabetes?
4031 2018-08-30 16:51:48 Oil money
4032 2018-08-30 16:51:44 My eye doctor said its age. ; ) Consider taking one fish oil supplement daily. Took about a month to see results but now my eyes don't water at all.
4033 2018-08-30 16:51:41 City’s oil money coming through again
4034 2018-08-30 16:51:34 ...Norway same amount of oil but only 4 million people to spread it across. Just think what we could do if we had full revenue from what we already have, never mid what is on the west coast. Then use this money to grow economy in other areas ; support for new business, low rates
4035 2018-08-30 16:51:26 No I’d don’t remember Laura the librarian. I do remember W sending my friends and I to die for his oil interests, and Halliburton. Giving out 2 trillion dollar contracts to build dragon tanks. Watching the Clintons vote for the war and buy 10 million in Halliburton stock
4036 2018-08-30 16:51:15 I mean why dumping popcorn to an oil spill is something you do while taking care of, cant really read the article xd
Nothing wrong with the tweet itself, sorry if it seemed like it was >.<
4037 2018-08-30 16:51:09 PS. There is no such thing as environmentally friendly oil.  #wow #nspoli

4040 2018-08-30 16:50:54 Full spectrum hemp oil (which contains cbd) is totally legal in all 50 states.
4041 2018-08-30 16:50:48 I really can stop smokin weed & just smoke my oil pen
4042 2018-08-30 16:50:46 Trudeau championed ABs oil by giving it 100Mt of our carbon budget.
4043 2018-08-30 16:50:43 NO, we need pipelines in order to ensure market access for our oil instead of selling it to the Americans at a massive discount.
Even if we stop using oil tomorrow, the world won't, and we MUST be the world's #1 supplier instead of OPEC dictatorships and Russia.
4044 2018-08-30 16:50:41 I fear another Lac Megantic is inevitable now as even more oil will be transported by rail. Just hope it isn’t in your town or city, people.
4045 2018-08-30 16:50:39 Gerry has made it clear he want Canada's Oil industry out! Sad!
4046 2018-08-30 16:50:35 The pipeline was about exporting more oil around the world, further fueling climate change. Instead, we should put the corporate welfare the oil companies get into green energy and start exporting windmills, solar panels, and hydro tech. That's what the future looks like. #nspoli
4047 2018-08-30 16:50:32 Why not try it with olive oil or just plain butter ohh ohhh if you can get your hands on some smoked salmon and some Gouda 
4048 2018-08-30 16:50:29 dude walked past me smelled like straight coconut oil
4049 2018-08-30 16:50:20 Need to go get this oil change
4050 2018-08-30 16:50:13 Policy reforms are strengthening #Argentina’s oil and gas and mining sectors, and agriculture is recovering post-drought. But it’s not enough to make up for construction sector doldrums; @jpmorgan says budget cuts and high interest rates mean “the worst is not over” for builders.
4051 2018-08-30 16:50:11 Moist dulu, karena kayanya kalo face oil bisa nembus moist. Tapi moist gk bisa nembus face oil
4052 2018-08-30 16:50:10 Already exists. Google "SEO Consultant." You'll find many snake oil salesmen among a wide range of talented folks
4053 2018-08-30 16:50:10 I get my oil changed by my mechanic.  Never tries to sell me anything and checks the other fluids and a few other things at no extra cost.  I even had him check my brakes a couple of time and he told me they were good.
4054 2018-08-30 16:50:08 #TransMountain more consultation = more delays = more trains cars full of oil & more chances for another #LacMegantic disaster. Those #TreeHuggers in BC who applaud the court decision will pay through the pump and taxes. Rail never stops.
4055 2018-08-30 16:50:07 You just got off the phone with the oil companies who fund your campaign and assured them your constant whining about Trudeau and the NDP will eventually work, right?
4056 2018-08-30 16:50:07 When is this madness going to end. We need to get our oil to the coast in a safe manner.
4057 2018-08-30 16:50:03 Coconut oil w/ coconut milk.  Recipe: 2 T Each of coconut oil & vanilla with vanilla liquid stevia in a CAN of coconut milk, full not, not light.  Keep in fridge.  Yum.

4059 2018-08-30 16:49:44 add the power of oil companies from... far out, but with deep pockets too. Sad picture
4060 2018-08-30 16:49:44 No, we need to do as much consultation as is legally necessary and get this project back on track. 
We NEED market access in order to stop selling our oil at a massive discount to the Americans.
4061 2018-08-30 16:49:34 Step4: preheat vegetable oil in frying pan. Step5: once oil is hot; take out a bit of the shedded potatoes and put in the egg mixture. Step6: place the egged potato into the oil after dipping it into a bit of flour.

4064 2018-08-30 16:49:13 I have to disagree on that one, if one ship comes to Canada with oil in it to pump on our shores it’s a loss for Canada, families rely on this work, like my family. Are you going to hire me to work for you?
4065 2018-08-30 16:49:11 オイルはギトギトというイメージを拭い去ろうか。時にはサラサラし、時にはギトギト。オイルはいつだって君のそばにいるのさ。
4066 2018-08-30 16:48:50 Hippie oil and peanut butter never a good thing.
You'll be wanting pop tarts
4067 2018-08-30 16:48:36 Save some of that machine oil for the rest of us!
4068 2018-08-30 16:48:31 My baby goes crazy for oatmeal with lemon olive oil
4069 2018-08-30 16:48:30 Hopefully you all understand that Nat Gas ==> NGL ==> Oil 
in descending level of risk correct ?  If you don't believe me explain why gov engineering safety standards are lower the further to the right you go.
4070 2018-08-30 16:48:28 I want to stop eating oil but there is oil in like everything
4071 2018-08-30 16:48:24 2018 US imports 20% of oil consumed, we are net energy importers. 
US is borrowing against tomorrow for today's growth. 
How long can we keep the three card monty game going?
"Markets can stay irrational far longer than you can remain solvent?" Is that where we are at with this?
4072 2018-08-30 16:48:17 Oil sector reform deferred is not oil sector reform denied I believe. Not everyone has the nerve ... 
History will not forget.
4073 2018-08-30 16:48:17 Soy , sesame seeds and oil
4074 2018-08-30 16:48:14 So my car had a bit of an oil leak and I took it in to the dealer's garage this morning - they found the cause, replaced the sealant that was not doing the job properly, and did it for free because I only bought the car two weeks ago. I consider that a good result!
4075 2018-08-30 16:48:10 Extra virgin olive oil is king. Pricey but I use it on everything. Watch out for fakes if you can. Canola oil is an economical alternative.

4078 2018-08-30 16:48:03 This is just unbelievable!  What’s the point of even producing oil now??  This is crippling
4079 2018-08-30 16:47:50 Tea tree oil coba nder
4080 2018-08-30 16:47:48 Look if it aint bacon grease distilled into oil I am out.
4081 2018-08-30 16:47:41 4 new pieces, nice! Best I've been able to manage so far this year, at least as far as finished work is concerned, is one simple oil painting, haha.
4082 2018-08-30 16:47:37 Oil vs oil
4083 2018-08-30 16:47:24 He used to ask that in confession. Colgate bought out Murphy's Oil Soap and that's what transformed the campus. I think the cornerstone of St. Mary's reads: quam levatio sepit.
4084 2018-08-30 16:47:09 @rhettandlink you guys should try doing an episode of "can you palm it" where you try to palm stuff, or even to make it more difficult try palming stuff that are usually easy to pick up but you'll do them with oil or something slippery on your hands
4085 2018-08-30 16:46:59 So, baby oil or rubbing alcohol for the glue?
4086 2018-08-30 16:46:59 ฝันดีนะคะพี่สาว @iam_Oil
4087 2018-08-30 16:46:54 Harper gutted the NEB to tilt it toward the oil industry, and he stacked its board after he lost the 2015 election. The result: Both Northern Gateway and now TMX have been overturned for broadly similar reasons.

Maybe there’s a lesson somewhere here?
4088 2018-08-30 16:46:53 6 mos ago #Trudeau stated he had the constitutional authority to ensure #TransMountain was built b/c it was in the 'national interest' of #Canada so @JustinTrudeau it's time to step up to the plate! #energy #oil @BNNBloomberg
4089 2018-08-30 16:46:49 Hi Edna, unfortunately we discontinued that product but we recommend mixing honey and some cinnamon into our Country Crock with Sunflower Oil spread to top your cornbread :)
4090 2018-08-30 16:46:49 Maybe this was the desired outcome all along.  He's said more than once he wants to phase out oil and gas in Canada, here he gets to mothball a gooder.
4091 2018-08-30 16:46:48 how do you move oil from coast to coast???
4092 2018-08-30 16:46:46 One thing to worry about here and it's a real concern is we have zero EPA.  They're already not adhering to levels and think about what happens when oil tightens.  They'll probably lift whatever limitation is there.  Flaring is a terrible waste of a natural resource.
4093 2018-08-30 16:46:44 I'm full of oil
4094 2018-08-30 16:46:35 A small group of Eco terrorist are winning. It is time for Canada to stop importing oil. This way the rest of Canada will begin to understand the value of the oil sands and the economic benefits.
4095 2018-08-30 16:46:25 Covered in oil #Sweet
4096 2018-08-30 16:46:23 We have to send oil to markets end of story
4097 2018-08-30 16:46:15 เลือดอาจหมดตัวก่อนเขินค่ะ 55
4098 2018-08-30 16:45:59 And Solo have also kept a percentage of UKOG - so are still involved in the Weald Oil Play...
4099 2018-08-30 16:45:54 2/2 the tax rev given back this year was 1.8 bn. This is where Gers falls down for oil, only includes what is given back, not the total tax revenue generated in Scottish waters. Get all tax revenue, open up west coast oil by getting rid of trident and economy will boom.
4100 2018-08-30 16:45:52 please go work for an oil company
4101 2018-08-30 16:45:49 6
4102 2018-08-30 16:45:34 I smell so motherfucking good! I like oil better than perfume.
4103 2018-08-30 16:45:33 that CBD Oil ain't that good @Lets_Go_Champ calm down
4104 2018-08-30 16:45:33 One cannot hide from the fact that certain tech companies are behaving like the old standard oil company and eventually may require the same anti trust treatment
4105 2018-08-30 16:45:26 I’m baking plantain to avoid the oil. I wonder how it will turn out.
4106 2018-08-30 16:45:23 The guy behind me on the salad line just got....olive oil and pepper as his dressing. Sad life.
4107 2018-08-30 16:45:22 Imagine the billions we would save if we didn't sell oil at all! Riches beyond our wildest dreams await if only we embrace a paleolithic lifestyle.
4108 2018-08-30 16:45:17 It’s not about the pipeline, it’s about what was planned for this toxic, flammable sludge after it gets to the Westridge Marine Terminal. 
Oil tankers, tanker traffic, oil spills, oil fires and what that would mean to the livelihood of those that live from the sea, our coast.
4109 2018-08-30 16:44:57 The scarcity of oil / natural gas is going to kill a lot of people but on the bright side helium will become too rare and precious to allow these balloons to exist
4110 2018-08-30 16:44:51 The point is that we need to stop using oil, and other carbon fuels, if we have any hope of preventing the planet from burning. Invest in green energy not fossil fuels. Conservatives in Europe understand this, why not here? #simple #nspoli
4111 2018-08-30 16:44:45 Exactly, pro oil people DO care about the environment and is why we INSIST on developing our resources herre with the HIGHEST environmental standards in the world instead of the world meeting oil demand from OPEC dictatorships and Russia.
4112 2018-08-30 16:44:35 So if I fuck up and go to jail they will feed my normal organic vegan diet..will they also supply my cbd oil to treat my cancer?
4113 2018-08-30 16:44:19 If you need an oil change, bring me the stuff, buy me food and consider it done.

4115 2018-08-30 16:43:48 Cheesecake Factory with John the Bomb before my oil change! Get to write a 12 page paper right after 
4116 2018-08-30 16:43:36 so oil lights homes now does it? does oil also tuck you in at night? does oil gently caress your shoulders when you've had a long day too charlie? poor charlie
4117 2018-08-30 16:43:30 I’m not even married yet & I’m over here making Jordan’s oil change & doctors appointments already 
4118 2018-08-30 16:43:30 said it before, will say it again - not everyone in this country kneels down to the oil industry. Take the hint.
4119 2018-08-30 16:43:26 What do u support? You’d rather Canada import our oil from Saudi Arabia when we have one of the largest supplies on earth? You would rather the US continue to rip us off?  You would rather see our economy stall? Do you know how dependent on oil you personally are Matt?
4120 2018-08-30 16:43:18 Where can I get black seed oil in and around Kano/Kaduna/Lagos and Abuja? 

Urgent!
4121 2018-08-30 16:43:16 Liverpool go to group D please.
4122 2018-08-30 16:43:12 Except that you’re wrong... you’re drinking The Tyee and Natobserver Kool aid. The extraction of oil sands is transitioning to other forms of extraction (SAGD) as well as reducing their GHG foot print. Your either not listening or are ignoring the facts. 1/1
4123 2018-08-30 16:43:11 onions, fresh tomatoes, groundnut oil, Maggi, curry, thyme. Jesu! 
In order words "You smell like unwashed plate" 
4124 2018-08-30 16:43:10 Your skiff cuts swiftly across the water, and nearby, the dark hump of something large breaches the water's surface. Its scales flicker in the sunlight, catching like a rainbow in an oil slick. It breaks the waves, making the way smooth for you.
4125 2018-08-30 16:43:09 I started taking really good care more recently, shampoo, conditioner and beard oil.
4126 2018-08-30 16:43:08 that is what was given back to Scotland from Westminster. But Scotland only get 8.9% of the tax revenue from oil (pop share) however if independent, we would get around 85% (geographical share) that would be around 15.6bn, wipes out deficit. (if oil price stable) 1/2
4127 2018-08-30 16:43:06 Go buy a jar of 100% coco oil & use it ALL shit will die so fast.
4128 2018-08-30 16:42:57 Is the Canadian Government going for three for three, Alberta Oil Patch, Ontario Auto Industry and Quebec Dairy. You really can’t make it up.
4129 2018-08-30 16:42:57 Good great free oil change
4130 2018-08-30 16:42:50 Wow  didn’t know. How do you apply it, and during ur routine, since it’s an oil do you apply while moisturizing?
4131 2018-08-30 16:42:41 I should mention that I brought my own oil
4132 2018-08-30 16:42:41 maybe it is time for oil junkies to take the hint...
4133 2018-08-30 16:42:37 No, we don't. For starters only a few refineries can handle it and they don't want to buy it. Secondly the shipping costs of our oil are much higher than the competition because we can only handle smaller tankers on the coast.
4134 2018-08-30 16:42:34 And that's why I've been working in Oil and gas in Qatar for the last 12 years. Canada is closed for business
4135 2018-08-30 16:42:28 Let's see them when oil drop to $40/b
4136 2018-08-30 16:42:21 i use avocado oil to stop the itch.
4137 2018-08-30 16:42:20 say goodby to canadian  oil    under liberal  canada  policy
   we will get oil from Islam country that wants to kill us
for being nonbeliever
  less jobs and less opportunity too 
       vote liberal
4138 2018-08-30 16:42:14 God bless Samantha. She just texted me that she shipped eucalyptus oil to my place to help with my migraines. what a queen
4139 2018-08-30 16:41:41 Iran has warned that if it isn’t allowed use the Strait of Hormuz for oil exports, it will halt the movement of all oil out of the region.
4140 2018-08-30 16:41:41 @dawnlyen Please forgive me but I’m sitting here catching up on season three. I’m in tears. “...take your snake oil.. cause we’re not buying it.” #queensugar #OWN @Oprah
4141 2018-08-30 16:41:35 You already have oil. Nobody is stopping the oil that is flowing from flowing. It is the expansion and tripling of the project.
4142 2018-08-30 16:41:31 In the morning when I wash my face I then wipe it with witch hazel and a good tea tree oil moisturizer. Sometimes we don’t moisturize cuz we think oils will make us oily when really it helps our skin not produce as much oil
4143 2018-08-30 16:41:28 Pipelines boost the economy. Don’t albertans want to sell more oil?
4144 2018-08-30 16:41:27 Definitely ignore all that stuff you see about boiling in milk. Bleurgh. Very gentle poaching of thin slices in oil is meant to be good. But I totally understand why not everyone finds them palatable.
4145 2018-08-30 16:41:27 น้องกูบอกว่าเกลียดแฟนเก่า แฟนเก่าน่าขยะแขยง55555 เดี๋ยวๆๆมึงผู้ชายนะด่าผู้หญิงไม่ได้ แต่ก็นะ อีนั่นคงทำไว้เจ็บแสบ ม.5เองหนูน้อย ชีวิตต้องเจอคนอีกเยอะ

可愛い！
4147 2018-08-30 16:41:20 I would say the word oil.
4148 2018-08-30 16:41:17 Hemp seed oil
4149 2018-08-30 16:41:14 Turn there heat off. No makeup. No cars. They can walk live in the dark. All these things plus a whole bunch more are from oil and gas. If your not with us your against us.
4150 2018-08-30 16:41:03 No new yourself have caused this problem, you told us nuclear threat was over we could sleep at night. North Korea got what they wanted. We all knew this was going to happen. Now go after Russia for giving North Korea oil. Russia is helping North Korea survive
4151 2018-08-30 16:40:51 think of like instead of an oil change after 3000 miles,
it's a firing after 300 lies.

Gotta keep her maintained!
also *jobs jobs jobs!* remember?
4152 2018-08-30 16:40:49 What kind of "performance car" costs $400 a year in oil changes?
4153 2018-08-30 16:40:39 Canada does have the cleanest dummy. Have you ever worked in the oilfield? I have for many years and we by far lead the way. Or maybe you would like the dirty blood Saudi oil
4154 2018-08-30 16:40:38 Re-stock.. 

The hair cream and oil that does wonders to your hair and beards are available at wholesale prices #500 each.
4155 2018-08-30 16:40:35 Piffle, Snake oil pusher, piffle.
4156 2018-08-30 16:40:29 Or the strong-arming to outright blackmail of the oil industry.

4158 2018-08-30 16:40:23 "We believe the bull market in #crudeoil ... is set to dramatically accelerate to the upside.

4159 2018-08-30 16:40:21 Listen to Vivian Krause about US $ in anti oil movement in Canada. Turns out the real pipeline is cash from US to enviros and natives in Canada. Seems to be working.
4160 2018-08-30 16:40:14 i threw an empty bottle of whale oil at piero too many times and he got knocked unconscious. sorry
4161 2018-08-30 16:40:09 CBD is the same as fish oil caps. Can I take my Omega 3s and CBDs please?!
4162 2018-08-30 16:40:09 is today the day i finally get an oil change or do i drive 40 minutes to get myle pods because i don’t have time for both

4164 2018-08-30 16:40:06 True... we are greatly depleting our coal and oil reserves 
4165 2018-08-30 16:39:59 Oh that’s great yah let’s start with attacking the ceo that’s promoting green living and actually thinking about the future of this country. Don’t even bother with the oil companies, or the tobacco companies, or the logging companies
4166 2018-08-30 16:39:56 Jesus is source of real joy and hope. If elitist Yale wants to be on frontline of progress they ought to divest of oil+ Saudi money. I'm having nothing to do with neuroscientists stealing glory from JESUS! I'm NOT INTERESTED in neurospychobabology.Jesus heals hearts+minds+=source
4167 2018-08-30 16:39:48 @TeamCavuto oh yeah , neil , one other nickname i have for my 2002 OLDSMOBILE INTRIGUE : ' puff the magic dragon ' because of the clouds of oil smoke emanating from the tailpipe upon acceleration . also i call it SAINT NICK because of all the red & green lites on instrument panel
4168 2018-08-30 16:39:24 I would rather my taxes go to paying for a child's healthcare than a subsidy for an oil billionaire.

4171 2018-08-30 16:38:31 WTI oil at $69.94/barrel, +$0.42 on Iran sanctions, lower U.S. fuel inventories.
4172 2018-08-30 16:38:14 The problem was that you used the Wacom pen to apply the oils.

I told you to use brushes -- their fine hairs make oil painting way more fluid.


4173 2018-08-30 16:38:11 You can’t out slick a can of oil bruh
4174 2018-08-30 16:38:06 It's odd that basically every commodity in the world is crashing for months except the King Commodity. Oil. #OOTT
4175 2018-08-30 16:38:02 Is it only me or you'll find fried chicken's leftover oil as the world's tastiest thing?
4176 2018-08-30 16:38:01 Face oil
4177 2018-08-30 16:37:57 the oil deal is never going to happen just FYI
4178 2018-08-30 16:37:56 I think the ginger, or sesame oil are more likely to be the culprit.
4179 2018-08-30 16:37:42 Getting the corolla an oil change already paying for itself  putting the miles on that rather than my new cars.
4180 2018-08-30 16:37:39 I suspect @jkenney is on the phone now, crying, screaming and begging his corporate oil tycoon masters to please not pull their money from his campaign, assuring them his whining and carping about Trudeau will eventually have the effect they want.
4181 2018-08-30 16:37:35 Our oil won’t even get out to sea fast enough, or even get processed with the new big tankers being built. Watch, this will send Canada more into debt.
4182 2018-08-30 16:37:35 Hi Olly, we're committed to using only the most sustainable sources of palm oil in our products. We have removed it wherever possible and 100% of the palm oil used in M&S products is RSPO certified. Denise
4183 2018-08-30 16:37:30 This was all created years ago with a handpicked NEB in the back pocket of oil/gas which unjustly passed this project. It was clear as day...

4186 2018-08-30 16:37:11 So I gotta get a oil change , 2 new tires and pay for my registration by tomorrow . HOW DID I JUST GET PAID AND IM ALREADY BROKE
4187 2018-08-30 16:37:10 What about the 100’s of thousands of families that rely on oil to feed families? And countries that want our oil should get it from middle eastern countries?
4188 2018-08-30 16:37:05 Coba pake minyak zaitun yg extra virgin oil. Waktu itu ku ada jerawat, jerawatnya langsung kering dan yg bruntusan kecil2 ilang, muku mulus dan lembab. Tp kalo diaku buat bekas jerawatnya blm gt ngaruh, kalo di kulit temenku menyamarkan bekas jerawat
4189 2018-08-30 16:37:01 They're bribing our politicians. Oil produced here or alternatives produced here, either one gets us out. But they don't want out, they want cash.
4190 2018-08-30 16:36:58 In order words when he said if he ever ran for president. He’d run as a Republican because they are the dumbest. Or have you forgotten that? He knew he could run a con on you. Same as snake oil salesman did in old western movies it wasn’t true then either.
4191 2018-08-30 16:36:52 Every time I see #TransMountain trending, it takes me a second to remember that it's about an oil pipeline and not a mountain fortress controlled by trans folks.
4192 2018-08-30 16:36:34 Trans Mountain still delivers 300 000 barrels a day, stop acting like it doesn't exist. It's still something the Government owns to the benefit of the oil industry.
4193 2018-08-30 16:36:32 Truffle oil is really not that expensive, thanks to a scientific breakthrough a few years ago.
4194 2018-08-30 16:36:26 I highly recommend the hemp oil and hemp supplements! They truly make a difference.
4195 2018-08-30 16:36:18 The bodega on my block started selling me the weed oil for vapes and now I feel like a walking version of Yosemite all day. We lit!!
4196 2018-08-30 16:36:14 And Demonetisation Model- Other than changing goal posts on Demo  and giving hardship to Indians, destroying the economy- Nothing has been achieved. India lost a chance to grow with low oil prices, reduced CAD/ Trade Defict and World economy doing good . Modi messed it up.
4197 2018-08-30 16:36:05 Hmmm that was right about the time of a big oil boom. Hmmmm. Conservative comes in, companies make money.
4198 2018-08-30 16:36:04 face oil dulu

4201 2018-08-30 16:35:49 You are represented as an individual to the same extent as any other.
If the highlands start to vote differently to the lowlands would you advocate further division?
Maybe independence for Shetland?
They could take their oil with them!
4202 2018-08-30 16:35:23 Reliance industries stock has gone up from 100 to 1600 in last 4yrs....loot loot so much manipulation in crude oil and Bsnl...so on
4203 2018-08-30 16:35:20 As far as i know, fuel prices are controlled globally. 2014fuel prices were result of global rate fall in oil prices. VAT is still collected at same rate...
4204 2018-08-30 16:35:19 Lol the full of shit part. Go drink some more oil. Lap it up. Good boy
4205 2018-08-30 16:35:10 The Groups Ive Monitored For Over A Year and Chatted w For A While Regarding That Oil Said Its Great and Sung Nothing But Its Praises,The Edibles, Frankly Any Chronic Pain Person Needs To Be Able To Functionn and Exercise To Feel Alright Enough Sometimes Requires This Treatment
4206 2018-08-30 16:35:10 Una no dey employ data analyst? Nawaooo! I thought dey said data is the new oil.
4207 2018-08-30 16:35:06 だから太宰治は人間失格だよね
4208 2018-08-30 16:35:05 Add fats into your diet!  Avocados, natural peanut butter & olive oil are some of my favorites! Start your meal with a salad.  This absorbs sugar! Eat protein with every meal!  This keeps you fuller longer! #SugarCravings #HealthTips
4209 2018-08-30 16:35:03 "... compromise on the oil,but not on the city..." is so far the bst strategy, I've ever heard!  In this way we show thr world, what Kirkuk really means for Kurds!
4210 2018-08-30 16:35:00 WHY DID MY PROFESSOR JUS CALL A GIRL NAMED “OLIVIA” “OLIVE OIL” JDJFJJFFJJFJF
4211 2018-08-30 16:34:55 พรุ่งนี้อัพถึงฉากคัทแน่นอนน เราจะไม่ทอดทิ้งผู้ใดค่ะ! 555
4212 2018-08-30 16:34:32 We have more oil than they do, but we land lock it and depress our economy so we have to buy it from them. Burning their oil rather than ours will somehow stop climate change.
4213 2018-08-30 16:34:32 60
4214 2018-08-30 16:34:16 Yeah it will take time but I’m only 27 so barring major disaster I think I’ll be around to see us get there mate. It’s not just about oil money any more it’s the foundations we have built around the team aswel. Can’t blame us for being excited after so many years of being shite
4215 2018-08-30 16:34:00 B, I'll do you a deal, get Charlie to come back home ( the holy grail that is Loftus Rd ) and you'll never run out of that oil gear ever again...Xx Dt and the QPR famleee love the Austin's
4216 2018-08-30 16:33:59 @DrAseemMalhotra tbh I got much better in this department lowering heavily the carbs and upping animal fat and proteins. SENSIBLE difference. Point is: is the olive oil or natural occurring fats in general that help hormonal response?
4217 2018-08-30 16:33:56 When niggas gotta show the fancy shit they're wearing in their social media video meanwhile they car has no oil, coolant leaks and a broken taillight.

Fucken losers....
4218 2018-08-30 16:33:55 The love those horses have for each other is phenomenal .  They love the green grass and lupen  They NEED to stay THERE !! Ranchers , miners and oil cos. Need to back off .
4219 2018-08-30 16:33:54 They are paid protestors, funded by American Big Oil to keep our Oil landlocked. The USA counts all Canadian oil as part of “their” reserves.
4220 2018-08-30 16:33:49 They bring there own equipment to get the oil out of Africa for Chinese use. Just because China hasn't come with tanks, they still are about 21st century colonization. Africa is getting pimped....again.
4221 2018-08-30 16:33:37 NOTE TO SELF. Don't drink chili oil, ever again.
4222 2018-08-30 16:33:30 I’m going to say 8
4223 2018-08-30 16:33:26 JT got his way. He HATES the West & he hates OIL more. Worst PM ever. Canada Wake Up!
4224 2018-08-30 16:33:15 I cldn't buy it bcz of soybean oil 
4225 2018-08-30 16:33:13 New. If you get a older model and it break down the its going to cost you the same. Plus if its new the upkeep as far as oil changes and things are free depending on where you get it from
4226 2018-08-30 16:33:12 Оно слишком сосочное
4227 2018-08-30 16:33:09 Has there been an environmental review of the impact of oil tankers sailing up the St Lawrence delivering foreign oil to Quebec.
4228 2018-08-30 16:33:09 Bullshit. Trans Mountain expansion added ONE extra tanker per day. 
Time to cut off all Foreign Oil tankers into Quebec until #TransMountain is completed. #cdnpoli
4229 2018-08-30 16:32:55 Cleanest. Most ethical. Environmentally-friendly.. wow.... Andy, you couldn't pander to the oil biz any harder if you tried.
4230 2018-08-30 16:32:52 Na bro not enough time to let the oil drain lol
4231 2018-08-30 16:32:52 @bukolasaraki wants to become President of dz country?? 
NW, NE & most part of NC wld see u as a Yoruba man; Saraki presidency is like power to the SOUTH. 
SW see him as a hypocrite
SE wld rather go wt @atiku 
SS can't trust him wt their OIL money 
Why are u dreaming, Mr. man?
4232 2018-08-30 16:32:50 Oh look, the C$ is  falling in value today. Congrats to US Midwest followers. Thx to the Federal Court of Canada - u will continue 2 enjoy half price  oil that keeps your prices low. Cdns on the other hand have 2 pay for gas in US dollars, so they can expect higher prices
4233 2018-08-30 16:32:47 No he won’t. He wants this as much as you. For once u Westerns should stick together weigh all Canadians and not think the east is out to get u. WE all want this pipeline built to the Pacific as well as the Atlantic. We hv to sell our oil to the world not the USA at a loss.
4234 2018-08-30 16:32:34 I used to use Gun Oil (silicone) but now I use Swiss Navy (silicone). Eden is probably better but it’s not packaged very well. Boy Butter is good when you are taking a really huge penis as long as you are going raw; it’s excellent for side-nigga dick 
4235 2018-08-30 16:32:19 Of course he doesn’t. He never cared in the first place. He better make sure NAFTA is signed. But then again why should a few dairy farmers hold it up when Alberta gives the USA DISCOUNTED oil.
4236 2018-08-30 16:32:14 All the more reason to read the #oliveoildiet soon to be available in Spanish also #dietadelaceitedeoliva
4237 2018-08-30 16:32:12 Like oil and water I can’t be mix with them
4238 2018-08-30 16:32:05 LOL, what universe do you live in? BHO blamed Bush for everything for a full 8 years. Obama never admitted to anything negative as it was always Bush, but always took credit for the positive. He took credit for lower gas prices while trying to reduce oil drilling on fed land. LOL
4239 2018-08-30 16:31:52 All Religion is a Form of Madness! Makes me mad!  Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil! Santa Claus is just Jesus in a colorful costume!
4240 2018-08-30 16:31:33 After lightly using Commodity Velvet and wondering why do I smell like I doused myself in Hamdard Rogham Badam Shirin, I realized it has almond oil.
4241 2018-08-30 16:31:30 Guess who wins? Every oil producing country but Canada. We are a laughing stock. USA and other producers are privately funding the pipeline opposition and protests. And our federal court system is on the payroll. Believe it.
4242 2018-08-30 16:31:28 Jiffy lube: “Jeep recommends synthetic oil and changing your oil every 3K Miles”

Jeep Owner manual: “conventional oil is fine, change every 10K Miles”
4243 2018-08-30 16:31:26 
4244 2018-08-30 16:31:07 So now we want regulation??? But only against Free Speech, not coal's pollution, not asbestos, nor for clean water & air, nor for preserving public lands for future generations (gotta get oil! Gotta frack!). Only to preserve FOX speech, everyone else is Fake! Believe Me!
4245 2018-08-30 16:31:07 You might want to think about changing the oil in your machine
4246 2018-08-30 16:30:44 Oil for blood. #SaveSyria
4247 2018-08-30 16:30:35 So, why weren’t you in court to support the construction? You’ve been pushing for a way to get our oil to market!
4248 2018-08-30 16:30:34 China will not fire any bullet but tell Pakistan to turn towards east and Iran towards South. Can even ask Iran
Chinese:"Hey, you guys want recreation on east side of Tiger River"
Iran:"What about Madina guys"
Chinese:"Don't worry, I buy tons of Oil from them"
Iran:"Adventure"

4254 2018-08-30 16:30:14 /rlt/ ada yg pake kleveru oil disini? Review dong
4255 2018-08-30 16:30:12 Oil is used to make countless products.
4256 2018-08-30 16:29:57 I'm not an expert, FAR from it lol. I'm like you, I know what I like, what I think is good :) I would say it's abstract? I've seen stains on concrete that I thought were amazing, clouds who's shape make me jealous I make them, oil slicks on street puddles that swirl with colors!
4257 2018-08-30 16:29:52 Seriously, I would really be interested if you could find one.  Even the most expensive 'truffle oil' I've seen contains 'aroma' - same with truffle cheese btw.  Similarly any chefs out there are welcome to post pics!  real truffle smells utterly different..
4258 2018-08-30 16:29:42 Once your guys see the improvements that will come they will be hooked.....Oil Up!!!!
4259 2018-08-30 16:29:42 so full of shit. Israel is sheer evil. No Israel no middle East conflict. Wish Iran'd nuke them. Stealing oil & land.

4263 2018-08-30 16:29:18 what about people who think they're superior for not putting milk or sugar in their coffee. not everyone needs to start the day with a fresh cup of condensed motor oil

4267 2018-08-30 16:29:03 Nothing like spending your day off first taking your car in for an oil change and now waiting for your son’s car tires to get fix.

4268 2018-08-30 16:28:57 Why did you enlist? Did you know at the time that burning fossil fuels hyperdrives global warming? Did you consider the war illegal? Was it about oil?
4269 2018-08-30 16:28:49 No, the Family Dollar is worse! I go in for a can of tomato paste (don’t ask) & I walk out with motor oil, napkins & fans. All to the tune of $75 or more. It’s maddening 
4270 2018-08-30 16:28:47 And the threshing floors shall be full of grain, And the vats shall overflow with new wine and oil. And I will compensate you for the years That the swarming locust has eaten, The creeping locust, the stripping locust, and the gnawing locust, My great army which I sent among you.
4271 2018-08-30 16:28:39 but seriously i am having trouble breathing tonight ahahahahaha looks like i have to lay off the chili oil for a while
4272 2018-08-30 16:28:24 It’s funny how this graphic coopts the language of clean energy to apply it to Canada’s oil sector.  You would think a marketing company played a role in that!  Along with all the ads promoting this pipeline on Twitter and Facebook.
4273 2018-08-30 16:28:10 mix of roadbuilders, construction, engineering firms, state DOTs, trucking companies, big oil all with way more power than us smart growthers, pro-equity, enviros, transit orgs
4274 2018-08-30 16:28:10 And solo oil isn’t an “oil company” per se, but an investment company. But why let the facts stand in the way of your #fakenews and #bullshit #ukog #solo

4276 2018-08-30 16:27:52 Wonder if #EnergyEast pipeline and tanker project will be resuscitated now that #TransMountain is in limbo. Another flawed EA process ( even worse! ) which I declined to participate in as an Expert Witness on marine oil spill risks.
4277 2018-08-30 16:27:46 You'll see more now because the #TMEX ruling.  More Oil by Rail
4278 2018-08-30 16:27:44 Yes I have that humid frizzy ass shit I hate it but my hair texture wet or straighten wit some good straighten spraying oil! My hair be lovely
4279 2018-08-30 16:27:37 Ok, thanks. Was trying to get a guesstimate on costs, relative risk of a hypothetical shift to light oil rather than heavy oil.
4280 2018-08-30 16:27:21 Green Technology Industry is booming, pipelines are old tech, oil is being transported by railway, currently Republican Congress will not be able to ratify any trade deals before November election, Mexico deal is useless, Trump is going to be a Lame Duck or Impeached. #cdnpoli
4281 2018-08-30 16:27:19 It’s not saying a blanket no to oil, we use it. It’s saying no to *more* oil. Problem with this society is always wanting more, more, more. Why not be ok w what we have. Expansion cannot happen under Paris guidelines.
4282 2018-08-30 16:27:09 Let’s be fair mate even with all your oil money your going to have to go some to catch up up with Fergies Utd for winning trophies let alone the rest of Utds history of winning. 1 swallow doesn’t make a summer.
4283 2018-08-30 16:27:08 Compared to China, Japan, and the West, countries in the embrace of Islam have brought the world little of value. If it didn’t have oil money it would be entirely backward. 

I suspect this is because oppressive religions firstly oppress new ideas.
4284 2018-08-30 16:27:06 I do think some burger restaurants in the south should try frying their fries in sunflower oil.  I really liked that in California, lighter then the peanut and other oils used here

4286 2018-08-30 16:26:57 @ElizabethMay just said exactly what I and many others have been saying fir years. Let's stop shipping our oil out of country only to buy it back, once refined, at a ridiculous premium. Let's refine our own oil right here in Alberta. The Green Party just won my vote.
4287 2018-08-30 16:26:33 After a day at the beach and salty, curly, unbrushable hair, @lushcosmetics Jason and the Argan Oil Shampoo Bar and Big Solid Conditioner saved my hair. I should’ve done before and after pictures. Followed by massages with Wiccy Magic Muscles and Sleepy body lotion. 
4288 2018-08-30 16:26:18 @PetroleumMin Respected Sir,

4289 2018-08-30 16:26:17 Everyone was so wrong when they said coconut oil is the answer to everything. The real answer to everything is apple cider vinegar
4290 2018-08-30 16:26:12 Oil by rail: so much safer, greener and better, eh?
4291 2018-08-30 16:26:08 Analysis: Did Saudi Arabia's Prince Mohammed Bin Salman Con The West? 
YES ! The West swallowed his smarminess Hook Line & Sucker wash down with to promise of oil & oily investment hopes
4292 2018-08-30 16:25:59 The interest rates are unreasonably high, often countries repay debt in assets such as cobalt or oil.
4293 2018-08-30 16:25:56 Because everyone knows Israel is known for the oil,  gas and diamonds.   
4294 2018-08-30 16:25:53 I did use tweezers so that the oil from my fingers wouldn't compromise the stickers.

4300 2018-08-30 16:25:30 Itu bukan cleansing oil, tapi face oil. Pakenya sesudah serum sebelum moist, 2-4 tetes aja
4301 2018-08-30 16:25:25 Some of these indirect contractors of #UKOG are mentally unstable on twitter who promote oil tankers all day so blocked them its sad as bullish for #Horsehill flow test however shows me the ONLY way to invest is #SoloOil max leverage on #horsehill plus derisked in other assets
4302 2018-08-30 16:25:22 You start criticising #BjP and I criticise #UPA for not paying #200Billion to Iran  in their tenure but that wouldn’t bring down oil price. Start using Public Transport if the price punches you
4303 2018-08-30 16:25:16 @Kathiejmornings @chrisparente @everyday_show So what you’re telling me is you can do Yoga in the morning to lower your blood pressure then take olive oil at night to raISE it!

4307 2018-08-30 16:24:26 I’m not being one !
The government can and should control the oil price .
And yes it can control !
You can ask many economists as well as some officials of the finance ministry as well !
4308 2018-08-30 16:24:24 This is a good reminder to get my oil changed. It’s been that long.
4309 2018-08-30 16:24:21 Btw eggs made with avocado oil is so incredibly delicious. 
4310 2018-08-30 16:24:06 The windmills, hydro electric dams, solar panels, coal, oil, nat gas, & nuclear fission power will be going into moth balls.
4311 2018-08-30 16:24:05 Unfortunately there does seem to be a concerted effort against anyone that likes Tesla or appreciates Musk.

Is it just money, it it jealousy, big oil, other manufacturers? Probably a bit of all. I just try to correct the FUD as and when I see it and call-out trolls.
4312 2018-08-30 16:23:57 Do you prefer the balm or the oil cleanser?
4313 2018-08-30 16:23:57 Wrong. We invest plenty in Green Energy. We would all be better off in the long run investing 4.5 billion in that sector instead of pipelines to deliver some of the dirties oil on the planet to market..
4314 2018-08-30 16:23:55 えっえっお大事にしてください……保冷剤を電子レンジで温めるとホッカイロ代わりになるんでお腹暖めて安静にしてくだちい……
4315 2018-08-30 16:23:50 Trying to save time & money for your business in the #oil industry? #RFID is making traction in the oil industry for valve tracking.
4316 2018-08-30 16:23:37 RE #4 - Unfortunately your friends are not the majority. The number of people who are more easily swayed by sweet talking snake oil salesmen outnumber the people who are able to decipher between lip service vs actual executable ideas.
4317 2018-08-30 16:23:34 Social media has this habit of making people think the extremes are what is the most popular when it comes to climate, pipelines, oil etc...Canadians have always had a far more nuanced and situational view and I daresay the media often makes this mistake as well.
4318 2018-08-30 16:23:28 Why be jealous of him, when you can BE him?
Just pour salad oil all over yourself, pomade your hair with axle grease, and sweat profusely...Voila!

4320 2018-08-30 16:23:11 Thanks!  Will definitely tune in!  NHRA ROCKS!!!
4321 2018-08-30 16:23:04 also to everyone today celebrating the federal court of appeal's verdict on kinder morgan- know that because of this, in addition to any NAFTA fallouts, our economy will become less valuable resulting in inflated prices for anything made by or consumes oil
4322 2018-08-30 16:23:03 I never comment on politics but I work in the oil/gas sector for 18 years & have been laid off twice in the past 3 years due to client budgets reduced due to oil prices, now I work for far less wage & spend conservatively as I'm scared to loose my job again, not a good feeling!
4323 2018-08-30 16:22:56 Oil = fat = feeling full longer so... you're good.  #ImMakingShitUp #ButMaybeItsTrue 
4324 2018-08-30 16:22:49 The pipeline would have only created 90 permanent jobs. We should refine more oil in Alberta. That would create many many more permanent jobs and much lower prices at the pump. Plus we could then sell and ship the refined product for more than the raw.
4325 2018-08-30 16:22:40 Is that oil or water?
4326 2018-08-30 16:22:36 Norway has set money aside for decades in a special fund from oil and gas production. They are highly educated and are bilingual. They support salmon farming as well. Their country is prosperous. Ours a disaster.
4327 2018-08-30 16:22:33 What absolute nonsense you utter.  The "cleanest, most ethical, environmentally-friendly energy in the world" may be #hydro-#electric, #solar, #wind, #tidal #ElectricVehicles, but it certainly isn't diluted bitumen #tar sands #oil. @CTVNews #cdnecon #cdnpoli
4328 2018-08-30 16:22:23 Devastating day for the oil industry in Canada and Canadian overall.  No more transfer payments to Quebec!
4329 2018-08-30 16:22:22 Critically analysing snake oil pushed by charlatans is not “bashing”. Actual cryptographers and good software engineers have one thing in common: they welcome criticism, instead of trying to hide their software’s failings under the rug.
4330 2018-08-30 16:22:22 Take a look @myGridGB. We already get a lot of U.K. electricity from #solar #nuclear #gas. We don’t get any from oil and only around 6% from coal. That is how we will do it.

4332 2018-08-30 16:22:09 I agree with you in that they will find a way to get it done, too much money at stake but , HOLY , amateur hour... #trudeau. Lesson to be learned... when an american oil company sells you a pipeline at a discount, DON'T BUY IT!! #duped

4336 2018-08-30 16:21:30 This lady keeps calling her essential oil work Holy but she keeps saying it like so emphasized and it’s been 20 minutes and I’m SICK of her! We get it your work is HOLY
4337 2018-08-30 16:21:28 I'm happy with this decision, but I doubt the process has come to an end, & the Trudeau government & Oil Industry have a lot riding on this.  And flushing $3.4 billion down the drain isn't much of a victory.
4338 2018-08-30 16:21:26 How the hell do you figure that, with all the Eastern Countries shipping in their oil in their leaky vessels?  Are you that much uniformed?
4339 2018-08-30 16:21:23 My livelihood matters, but no more than inhabitants of Kiribati or the Marshall Islands who will soon not have homes because of sea level rise. Pipelines decrease the cost of producing oil, therefore working to increase production and consumption.  They exacerbate the problem.
4340 2018-08-30 16:21:21 ALERT ALERT ALERT. English Oil is RUNNING OUT!

4344 2018-08-30 16:21:03 Not near as much doubt as you fostered in the 70’s by dropping the speed limit to 55 MPH across the Nation and telling us that the world was soon to be out of oil. That was the biggest lie ever. Go hammer something.
4345 2018-08-30 16:20:41 What do you want me to do Nikki? Take the video down and do it again because I said "CBD" instead of "cannabis oil"?

4349 2018-08-30 16:20:24 Where do you buy MCT oil & what kind of benefits do you get from it?
4350 2018-08-30 16:20:19 Israel does this because the US promised to bail their sorry asses out if it goes pear shaped. We bailed their asses out in Yom Kippur War (which they were losing) and the 1973 Arab Oil Embargo resulted. Which crippled our economy and caused a massive recession.
4351 2018-08-30 16:20:00 97 is NOT a drilling ban. It provides for increased setbacks. Citizens had to do an initiative because #coleg couldn’t pass even modest reforms thanks to oil and gas interests.
4352 2018-08-30 16:19:55 Patra is a big liar and despite having zero knowledge about oil and gas he is in the board of ONGC ...looting public money
4353 2018-08-30 16:19:41 Oil transport by rail would stop if pipeline capacity existed because it costs more to rail it.

4359 2018-08-30 16:19:22 Clearly your chart makes another clear argument against increased extraction of oil.  With greater extraction comes greater corruption.  ;)
4360 2018-08-30 16:19:17 Advantix is a topical oil you can get to help with that. Simparica is prescription stuff that comes in a chewable form that's kills ticks also. Our dog has Simparica and I'll find a dead tick here and there, it's great.
4361 2018-08-30 16:19:17 Hunger especially with kids has to be addressed with MORE JOBs! But It dont make sense to do work requirements where some areas DONT HAVE GOOD JOBS available!

4401 2018-08-30 16:15:10 My fellow #Nigerians. Crude oil now about $76.00 per Barrell. Largely thanks to sanctions on Iran. E Dupe. 
Also, excess crude account has surged. Pay attention to cash flow in the coming months

4404 2018-08-30 16:14:58 Wow.... what a disastrous mess we are now saddled with in Canada!  Instead of safely shipping oil we will substitute transport by train and just jam up our rail traffic and jeopardize villages (like Lac Megantic) enroute.   The liberals have tried but they politicized this issue!

4409 2018-08-30 16:14:08 Josie Maran whipped argan oil, pure argan oil, or argan milk! Her products have changed my skin entirely (I suffer from extremely dry skin and eczema). I also recommend using a humidifier as it gets colder that’s helped me a lot too!
4410 2018-08-30 16:14:02 That oil honestly helped the next day my skin felt soo good. Ima def mix something up tonight and try to get the same effect!
4411 2018-08-30 16:14:02 Here is what I don't grasp. Just me, so please help. The US has tons of oil and 1000 years of supply of natural gas (or is it 2000?). Hence, we can take care of ourselves. We also have the best of everything else. Even good weaponry. So why is the petrodollar so important...now?
4412 2018-08-30 16:14:02 yes again Pak generals will be paid for an assault in afghanistan in the name of daesh and terror and paki soil will be used bad time coming oil/commodity prices are going up and generals are running their business freely
4413 2018-08-30 16:13:44 i would try canna oil to sleep!
4414 2018-08-30 16:13:28 @WoodfordCHNL One option would be to see if the states of Washington or Oregon would be interested in shipping the oil via their ocean ports.  If yes, the next step would be to see if Idaho and Montana would be interested in a pipeline through their state.
4415 2018-08-30 16:13:23 Right - but the federal govt refuses to regulate guns at a national level.  Carbon emissions, oil drilling - sure, they’ll push federal laws / acts for that, but now way will this congress / pres push for national gun regulation

4420 2018-08-30 16:12:46 Y’all I’ve been slacking on shaving my legs and I made the monumentally big mistake wearing shorts to go get my oil changed at the dealership :) I can feel my hairs blowing in the wind bahaha
4421 2018-08-30 16:12:45 It goes from AB to Vancouver and supplies most of our oil, no?
4422 2018-08-30 16:12:43 Chevron paid for an anti-socialist ad?  Wtf is big oil even allowed to be in politics in the first place? Politics was supposed to be for the people by the people. Not big busine$$ #resist #endcitizensunited
4423 2018-08-30 16:12:37 Great car! I have a 2006 Sport which has over 240,000 miles on it and has never needed a major repair. Only maintenance work like oil changes, tires and brakes. It’s such a great car I’m keeping it until it quits.

4433 2018-08-30 16:12:14 The price of adapting to climate change and mitigating its devastation will far outweigh any economic hardship to wean off oil.  But it will be paid by our descendants and by billions o& innocent people around the world.  So it’s easy to not value that.
4434 2018-08-30 16:12:02 A poorly considered decision, conflating issues. The pipeline to Vancouver and the possible oil exports are separate issues. We can have one without the other. Building export terminals for tankers requires a separate approval.

4445 2018-08-30 16:11:12 CIA agents demanded that the oil of the eastern region be released from the United States as a condition for withdrawal from Syria. They do not get the house into the people's countries. The refugees are dying every day. America and the West are very evil.

4450 2018-08-30 16:10:55 Plus, on CFAX the 7fold tanker increase was debunked.
This just wastes more money making lawyers rich.  Big Oil and govt make too much $ off oil to let this sink. 
Heaven forbid they spend $4.5B to get cars to 100mpg or running on water or magnetic motors. Politics!
4451 2018-08-30 16:10:33 Why do refiners need anything. How about we start with a list of what big oil and refiners already get in terms of “help”
4452 2018-08-30 16:10:31 I kind of feel like this was the goal all along: big payout to oil buddies, make it look proactive to the ‘BertuhStrong crowd, and it never actually gets built so the environmentalists are happy. Now it’s locked away and they can say, “Oh whelp, we tried.”

From a group of people who keep saying they are oppressed by the Canadian government, its funny how we now need to buy oil from saudi Arabia, one of the most oppressive states. The indigenous communities self-victimization is hurting canadians and Saudis alike.

4473 2018-08-30 16:08:15 Perhaps, at current rates of U.S. use. 

Topic is the loss of oil (and gas) worldwide, due to depletion, increased use (including U.S. plans for more exports) and geopolitical events, and how that would affect world economies. Oil is fungible. Supply changes affects all nations.
4474 2018-08-30 16:08:14 I'm sad to see the Russia has have an Economy based on oil and gas it is not the future I hope that Russia starts to move and transition to a sustainable energy economy but I'm very happy to see the American sanctions aren't working
4475 2018-08-30 16:08:05 If you want to stick it to the Kochs and their ilk while helping poor Canadians (and middle class Canadians' retirement accounts), supporting Canadian pipelines is one of the best ways.  Canada loses $2B per year as a country because it can't get the oil out of Alberta.

4485 2018-08-30 16:07:05 Carter inherited horrible stagflationary economy.  Hired Paul Volcker to do necessary but painful fix to stop it.  ‘79 oil crisis was due to Iran revolution.  Also began deregulation to solve many problems, finished by Reagan.  But yes, Carter was horrible communicator of it all!
4486 2018-08-30 16:06:50 Looks like a 70s oil tycoon
4487 2018-08-30 16:06:48 Ahhhh, just to what energy are you referring. Certainly not the oil sands. 
Oil is oil. It pollutes because we arent allowed to burn it efficiently. Not much profit if we get 100mpg.
4488 2018-08-30 16:06:38 Totally agree our oil is often far more ethical than overseas oil. Also totally agree that global warming is a global issue. But using WW2 analogy, Canada went and fought even tho we knew we weren't the tipping point (& even tho US didn't initially). It was our duty, we did it.
4489 2018-08-30 16:06:09 Might have been slightly premature with the tanning oil 
4490 2018-08-30 16:06:08 Of course, the oil price collapse and recession in Alberta had nothing to do with the results. Brad - learn to look at data and the whole picture. Ex ante and ex poste matter
4491 2018-08-30 16:06:01 most of the powers that can be used to grow economy are controlled by WM. In 50 years our greatest resource (oil) will be pretty much done. If wait 50 yrs, then WM will do the job for us, will drop Scotland as soon as the oil runs out
4492 2018-08-30 16:05:47 US is getting out of Arab world hence Indian Ocean sooner or latter cos US becoming self sufficient in oil for next 50 years because of shell oil and Canadian tar sand. Diogo Garcia will just be ornament to display. Indian Navy is all the rusted guns with no shells to fire.

4495 2018-08-30 16:05:36 Exactly. This is a monumental setback for Alberta and Canada. And we continue to receive and use Saudi Oil.
4496 2018-08-30 16:05:28 In the meantime the Fed has taken control of a major pipeline that Alberta uses to get our oil to market. Communism much...

4503 2018-08-30 16:04:53 The world still runs on Oil and will for the seeable future.  Canada should be part of that future. We have lots oil just waiting to be refined. We can work toward a world without oil in the mean time.

4521 2018-08-30 16:03:03 You live in a fairytale. Oil is still going to flow. Just like coal.  Coal is still being shipped in larger quantities to other countries. Oil will do the same just going by rail instead of pipe. Diesel pumping train.
4522 2018-08-30 16:02:58 Some countries are increasing oil/gas production.

Is cold fusion or another clean energy imminent?

4537 2018-08-30 16:01:35 That’s it, I’m moving to Canada. They also just did this: Canada’s Fed Court of Appeal on Thursday quashed the approval of the contentious Trans Mountain pipeline expansion that would nearly triple the flow of oil from the Alberta oil sands to the Pacific Coast.
4538 2018-08-30 16:01:26 The lawyers, greedy self-interest groups and foreign interests like Tides funding protestors have won. Saudi Arabian despots funding terrorism against Canadians with money we pay for their oil are the winners. Sad day for confederation.

4547 2018-08-30 16:00:21 I'm big into oil. I own lots of it and I know what it smells like. It's rich smelling. The smell itself spawns property and mansions.
4548 2018-08-30 16:00:21 Refine it in AB. Sell gas not cheap oil.
4549 2018-08-30 16:00:12 Oh do wake up. Project Fear is a load of bullshit. The city is going nowhere. “Your” oil however will run out.
4550 2018-08-30 16:00:09 Bureaucrats and common sense; oil and water. Same with the UK Windrush generation, people who came over by ship 40 years ago or more having problems because they didn't still have their landing cards (the Home Office having destroyed many themselves).
4551 2018-08-30 16:00:05 They could hv done better a colourful PH with beautiful girls could hv made sense wen it relates to d lyrics of d song. He rather was showcasing oil spillage and poverty

4557 2018-08-30 15:59:56 “Oil industry invests in railway infrastructure to increase shipments by rail”  Could be a headline soon!
4558 2018-08-30 15:59:55 As much as I complain, my department did a potluck w my favorite foods, gave me a new potted plant, and an oil diffuser for my birthday before I leave for a week long camping trip.
4559 2018-08-30 15:59:53 what’s bad is the vegetable oil that’s in all the processed junk. they were paid to lie so people would stop consuming coconut oil and continue eating all the shitty food. vegetable oil>too much omega6>inflammation.
4560 2018-08-30 15:59:48 DEREGULATION?  Allowing polluters free access to our precious waterways AND allowing fouling the air we breathe AND DRILLING FOR OIL ON PRISTINE PUBLIC LAND?
TAX CUTS?  Trump's Billionaire friends thank you very much and they told you to give lollipops to the general population.

USA know how to take care of their 'legal territories overseas' 

instead of bombing other countries

just because they don't have enough oil

to pay Nat Debt.

@BarackObama @realDonaldTrump your "hungry for war" media not helping your poor ppl at home
4562 2018-08-30 15:59:38 Our country is a joke. We are owned by special interests who are blocking ethical oil for their paymasters in dictatorships and the US. #transmountain #cdnpoli
4563 2018-08-30 15:59:35 Psalm 23.5 
You prepare a table before me
    in the presence of my enemies;
you anoint my head with oil;
    my cup overflows.
4564 2018-08-30 15:59:24 I took out almost all olive oil after you said it was a bit much
It has started, no pressing around, just leaving it there I assume?
4565 2018-08-30 15:59:20 Extra virgin olive oil.
4566 2018-08-30 15:59:17 Sprinkle on parboiled potatoes, toss in olive oil, & slow roast...yum 
4567 2018-08-30 15:59:12 I can't find it now - dang; but there was a piece I put up w/ pics that showed Chinese ships doing a sea transfer of OIL  !!
4568 2018-08-30 15:59:11 3rd largest oil/gas reserves in the world and may as well turn out the lights and go home. Investors are running away and every other producer in the world is laughing at us.
4569 2018-08-30 15:59:10 Chick-fil-a is overrated. Ion like that they cook the stuff in peanut oil.
4570 2018-08-30 15:59:08 I am addicted to frozen kroger simple truth quinoa with olive oil and salt
4571 2018-08-30 15:59:01 i HATE fish, but it healthy, so i get fish oil pills to get health, but 1 thing i learned today is they cause FISH BURPS WHICH LEADS TO FISH THROW UP #traumatized #scarred #donewithpills
4572 2018-08-30 15:58:52 We have oil. We’d like to sell oil.
We have people. They’d like to work......
But whatever....it’s fine.
4573 2018-08-30 15:58:51 Oh dear, I'm sorry. I once dated someone with a coconut/palm oil allergy - but not life threatening - and it really is in everything
4574 2018-08-30 15:58:39 So you would rather continue to buy oil and have Saudi Arabia which has terrible human rights policies and supporters of terrorism and no environmental controls continue to reap the benefits of the world continually needing more oil. Great stance. Our country is falling apart.
4575 2018-08-30 15:58:37 Men: “Olive” Oil the body well to be happy and maintain a firm resolve throughout life.

4578 2018-08-30 15:58:25 It is so embarrassing to have an ineloquent snake oil sales man as @realDonaldTrump as the President. His disrespect for the DOJ, intelligence and security agencies, the press, and anyone whom appears to be critical of his machinations undermines the very foundation of the USA.
4579 2018-08-30 15:58:24 So virtually the end of the road is here for Saraki and he thinks the best way to divert his looming impeachment is to declare for presidency what a shenanigan from an innuendo
4580 2018-08-30 15:58:16 So how long until the USA starts asking for even steeper discounts on oil as they are still our only customer?
4581 2018-08-30 15:58:08 I'm so angry that Canada must continue to import oil from a country where my daughter and son would be subject to, and I quote: "Fines, floggings, prison time up to life, death, whipping, and deportation. People convicted twice face execution" just for being who they are. #ableg
4582 2018-08-30 15:58:04 OPEC doesn't sell oil, it is an umbrella body that regulates Oil production. It's like saying the Leafs are not playing the Rangers, they are playing NHL. Saudi Arabia is jailing women. We have oil but we prefer to pour money into dictatorships!
4583 2018-08-30 15:57:57 We'll see how they act when they're oil wells start running dry.
4584 2018-08-30 15:57:47 Coconut oil is the ultimate catfish
4585 2018-08-30 15:57:41 Got my hair done now Callie getting an oil change, more maintenance, and now a wash.
4586 2018-08-30 15:57:30 coconut oil isn’t bad.

4593 2018-08-30 15:57:03 Meanwhile the trains loaded with oil continue to travel through the pristine Rockies to unload oil onto ships unabated.
4594 2018-08-30 15:56:57 Awesome, very proud! I’m super tempted by a pranamat but I sense it might be snake oil
4595 2018-08-30 15:56:56 Luckily I've got another way to test the heat, especially with fried rice, which needs oil (olive oil to fry, later on adding sesame oil for taste/fragrance).
When I think the oil in the pan is hot enough, I just throw in a little piece of the cut up onion. The sizzling tells me.
4596 2018-08-30 15:56:53 Did you ask him why he spent a ton of cash on numerous court losses when he could have simply used us (FN's) for free?. Does he still refuse to say how much tax payer's money that he has wasted on this? Any comment on the increasing oil imports coming into Burnaby by tanker?
4597 2018-08-30 15:56:45 15/19 attackers on 9/11 = wahhabi Muslims that the majority of Muslims do not support, it was a plan to take all the oil and route it through Aramco (the us is partnered now) and in the process create mass migration and hatred with the end goal of less freedom of the individual.
4598 2018-08-30 15:56:37 we don't need oil anymore lizzy.. all we need to do is just keep building condos and homes to be bought with illicit Chinese $.. it's been working for over a decade. Simple! What could possibly go wrong?

4601 2018-08-30 15:56:14 Can’t “like” this but it’s so true. How about a law that we only import oil from countries able to pass our environmental and legal standards?! Importing millions bbl/day from despotic regimes but can’t move our own product even across our country. Sad day for confederation.

4607 2018-08-30 15:55:49 In all honesty im so lucky for my man. I posted something the other day saying “what a girl gotta do to get flowers??

4608 2018-08-30 15:55:46 I didn't say CBD oil was illegal. I said cannabis was. and said they confiscated his CBD, which they did. His particular CBD has traces of THC in it.
4609 2018-08-30 15:55:34 There is something called attraction oil?

4621 2018-08-30 15:54:54 Not if people need its products/services, or don't even know how much they use them (e.g. oil).  Businesses are rarely held accountable for their actions (e.g. Wall Street during recession), and have the money to weasel out of accountability and influence public opinion.
4622 2018-08-30 15:54:51 They identify each other by those strange glowing rings.  Is that spy car making a knocking noise above 3000 rpms?  Need a discount on an oil change for that car?  Show them the ring.

4628 2018-08-30 15:53:59 Unbelievable. But speaks to not only the power & influence on government of the resource industry, but the feverish political belief that oil  is our only way to pay the big bills. Canada is stuck in the "hewers of wood" mentality. We need to level up our economy.
4629 2018-08-30 15:53:50 y’all i added rosehip oil to my skincare routine yesterday and. holy shit my skin today.
4630 2018-08-30 15:53:24 If anyone cares, the Federal Court of Appeal rejected submission by BC govt that Ottawa's go-ahead did not adequately assess oil spill risks. Decided for other reasons. #bcpoli #KinderMorgan
4631 2018-08-30 15:53:15 Oh rip, oil is a bitch sometimes lol, hope the rest turned out alright though
4632 2018-08-30 15:53:09 En 1919 Marco Fidel Suarez nacionalizó el petróleo y USA bajo amenaza con invasion militar hizo derogar el decreto y crearon concesion barco-mares, 
Cada congresista recibió un carro por parte de la Standar oil company y los hijos fueron llevados a estudiar becados en USA

4635 2018-08-30 15:53:00 The #TransMountain decision is a monumental win for the rights of Indigenous peoples and all of us who stand with them in firm opposition to a project that would massively increase climate pollution and put our coast at huge risk of oil spills.

4652 2018-08-30 15:51:31 Canada’s ability to build major projects is gone. We are subsidizing the USA’s corporations to ignore environmental issues with the profits our offshore oil exports would have provided to us to invest in Canadian environmental projects. What a mess!
4653 2018-08-30 15:51:30 The double-whammy decision against the #KinderMorgan pipeline validates the strong concerns of #Vancouver & many others that Indigenous peoples were not adequately consulted - and marine impacts of oil tankers were ignored - in the federal review & pipeline approval.
4654 2018-08-30 15:51:28 I've always pointed out how all the huge areas of growth in Minnesota are next to the North Dakota and South Dakota state lines, as the fracking oil and natural gas boom leaks over the borders. The Eastern part of Minnesota has little to no growth.

4684 2018-08-30 15:48:28 It’s crazy the loyalty women have for other women when it comes to men. I could be like Susan burned the house down in a rage and some random woman will be like well she was probably cooking for her man and when they were arguing she accidentally spilled oil on the fire.
4685 2018-08-30 15:48:24 I haven’t had an oil change since March, wtf is wrong with me
4686 2018-08-30 15:48:18 Been hanging with these robotfurs for weeks and they still haven't cottoned on that I'm wearing mostly buckets. 
I almost blew my cover by referring to Samurai Pizza Cats, but managed to seal the deal by drinking a pint of Motor Oil and eating a calculator.
4687 2018-08-30 15:48:16 Now what @JustinTrudeau ?  Another screwed up project by your gov't. Buy oil fr Saudi's fr now on instead of boosting the Cdn economy?
4688 2018-08-30 15:48:12 Great. I hope this also clarifies whether tanker to tanker dilbit transfers off the BC coast where planed. Something mentioned fleetingly in #cdnmedia.

wld double risk of dilbit spill, operational pollution re bilge, oil, noise & light. Whale strikes etc.

4690 2018-08-30 15:48:05 And exporting doesn't create jobs how?? We can't even ship our oil to other provinces in Canada let alone other nations.. so tell me smart guy, whats your plan to distribute the oil now that the pipeline has been voted against?

4707 2018-08-30 15:46:28 With our current government, the oil companies will get the money they seek. You can take that to the bank.
4708 2018-08-30 15:46:25 For financial data, I don’t know them by heart but it’s been said many times how Canada and it’s provinces are losing millions of dollars daily because we can’t export our oil. Money which could go for public transit infrastructures, alternative energy projects, education etc
4709 2018-08-30 15:46:25 @eNRgyTT Could only assume that they believed the oil prices would have been always high to cover their inefficiencies.
4710 2018-08-30 15:46:22 from Basra.According to observers and local officials in Basra- Baghdad, more than 40 armed factions and about 10 political parties in Iraq are feeding materially on oil smuggled from southern Iraq, as well as six Kurdish parties also funding themselves from Iraq's looted oil in

4713 2018-08-30 15:46:06 If one assumes the amount of oil being exported is the most CDA will export unless a company/gov't wants to spend years doing the process in a way that pleases the court ... what's next? Is there a gradual shift to declining energy exports and increased alternative focus @ home?

4715 2018-08-30 15:45:54 Why’s it taking so long to get my oil changed
4716 2018-08-30 15:45:52 The problem is nobody in Burnaby B.C & none of the indigenous people want that pipeline because of the history of oil spills and accidents with tankers (ie Exxon Valdez). After the largest wild fires this year the residents there would prefer solar panels over pipelines.
4717 2018-08-30 15:45:30 It took me four decades to realize that “essential oil” is not necessary oil, and instead oil with essence.  It dawned on me as I was explaining its meaning to someone else.
4718 2018-08-30 15:45:20 Who tryin change my oil ?
4719 2018-08-30 15:45:15 'Export' makes Canada's economy stronger, and improves lives for all! There is nothing wrong about exporting oil from this land! 
4720 2018-08-30 15:45:14 comrade drumpft is a snake oil salesman...you bought you drank now you worship at the alter of a false god...BTW read the constitution pee pee pants was elected for 1 term of 4 years NOT 8 years.
4721 2018-08-30 15:44:51 Run it for a while in the barnyard to warm up the gearbox, then pop the plug and see what comes out.   I would then fill it with oil and call it good.  If your worried, you could fill it with diesel fuel, run it for a couple min and drain, then flush it with oil
4722 2018-08-30 15:44:49 The political class is not doing anything about the menace of drug abuse because it is not about lifting oil..... Aisha Buhari
4723 2018-08-30 15:44:40 May God grant the wisdom today to reject the snake oil salesmen selling their false piety, and grant us blessed rest in the finished work of Christ.
4724 2018-08-30 15:44:37 Of course, to be pedantic, and it's why I mentioned "tailpipe emissions". I suppose I could also take it back to specific gravity of the oil refined to make the PVC cable housings to determine the true carbon contribution of each scooter, but that's almost infinite regress

4727 2018-08-30 15:44:18 I can see if you’re talking about independent media but the notion  that any mainstream outlet is a check and balance system is laughable. They are bought and paid for by Oil, WallStreet, weapons contractors and pharmaceuticals.
4728 2018-08-30 15:44:14 In fact a lot of states have this(46). In Texas they have the “Rainy Day Fund” that is from oil and has revenue. These are actually called Economic Stabilization Funds, we use it for shortfalls or emergencies.

4731 2018-08-30 15:44:01 I don’t think that is actually a choice we need to worry about. The federal government is going to put a price on carbon whether the provinces like it or not. Now we just don’t have to worry about a lot of oil spilling into nature.
4732 2018-08-30 15:43:55 Kak pija, cleansing oil sy beli dekat amazon jee hehe
4733 2018-08-30 15:43:53 What about having ethical Canadian oil, produced to the highest standards in the world to replace conflict oil and oil produced to lower environmental standards than us across the globe until we find adequate alternatives? Isn’t global warming a global issue?

4736 2018-08-30 15:43:29 I like ethical oil. I think we should ban all Saudi oil imports but then the east would be very cold.
4737 2018-08-30 15:43:26 Oil or cooking spray. But, the big thing with breakfast meats is cooking at a low temperature for a little longer usually yields the best results! Good luck, dude! We all gotta eat!

4741 2018-08-30 15:42:27 In-n-Out uses cotton seed oil to cook with.
With cotton being a chemically intense crop, sprayed before, during and after harvest, with pesticides, defoiliants, etc, imagine what process it takes to make a food grade oil?

Follow the lobby money.
4742 2018-08-30 15:42:21 The Santa Monica Oil Spill was the most destructive event in America's history.  

Not because it was all that bad, but because it crystalised the modern NIMBY movement.
4743 2018-08-30 15:42:19 Take all oil, tax revenue&GDP too? Can ship oil out via the Salish Sea with all the other US oil? We are being so dumb. However, thankfully, it does seem the court ruling is very light. The pipeline will be built but Canada is failing itself.

4753 2018-08-30 15:41:41 That was unsalted dry roastedpeanuts, salt, and a little peanut oil. 
I have used it as normal peanut butter before, but that batch was mixed with a little soy sauce, brown sugar, chichen broth, and ginger to make a peanut sauce.

I know I chose my bundles over my oil change yesterday
4764 2018-08-30 15:41:05 It turns out that all the shops near me only sell #vegan spreads that contain palm oil, and palm oil production is currently putting animals on the endangered list according to @WWF @wwf_uk so I guess if I want cookies I have to go back to regular goat or cow butter.
4765 2018-08-30 15:40:59 49 years and counting, chemo right now not doing well at all. It might change in long term and I believe that might happen after 1) Complete failure 2) We run out of oil 3) People wake up and work for a better Libya or 4) They are forced into unity and prosperity
4766 2018-08-30 15:40:41 No human being has a fundamental human right to own an oil field, a  forest, a vast area of land, a copper mine, a diamond mine, a gold mine etc. The planet’s resources should collectively belong to all of us — not just to the most vicious, vile and selfish people.
4767 2018-08-30 15:40:38 I hope all those opposed to the pipeline are totally green. I hope you don't use any petroleum products. You should only be buying locally produced food. It also means that you should not be driving any type of vehicle that runs on gas and uses oil.

4776 2018-08-30 15:39:27 And it’s nothing like a UBI. It is their because of the windfall from oil and other natural resources. UBI relies on stripping money(tax wise) from others to make everyone universally poor.

Would you consider CBD oil if the legislation changes? x
4782 2018-08-30 15:39:11 I looked at one of the guys chastising Oil fans for complaining to see if he was super young or a new fan. I found a recent tweet from him saying Garrison was solid and could have 3-4 years left. That wasn't the info I was looking for but it was enough to explain a lot.
4783 2018-08-30 15:39:07 It is on it’s own,  but try it with say roasted peppers, lots of mixed herbs and olive oil....yummy

4808 2018-08-30 15:36:48 they say oil chokes up your heart... so does love. 
but do we stop loving?
4809 2018-08-30 15:36:41 How can we feed a family of five when all we have is a monochrome Gameboy, a vintage polystyrene cup and fifteen bottles of olive oil?
4810 2018-08-30 15:36:38 Here's the irony. Part of the oil shipped via @TransMtn goes to refineries in WA state where it is turned into gasoline & trucked to Chevron stations on the Lower Mainland & Van Isle. Chevron gets the oil at a discount & then charges #YVR drivers the highest pump prices in Canada

4819 2018-08-30 15:35:55 Need to oil my joints again. I swear, sometimes I feel like the tin man from the wizard of oz =A=
4820 2018-08-30 15:35:39 but what about home heating oil? Not everyone lives in a city, what about them?
4821 2018-08-30 15:35:34 So you support oil by rail through mountain parks? The oil is still delivered bud, just less safely.
4822 2018-08-30 15:35:31 Thank goodness for a super strong USA economy and decent oil prices. Imagine if U were in Harper's shoes, with a US/world economic crisis 2008 and collapsed oil prices 2014. Libs may be incompetent but u R lucky!
4823 2018-08-30 15:35:20 And those are the bone heads who would vote for Cons to continue to pillage the earth. By using the funds from getting oil to tidewater more effectively, we can educate and provide comparable jobs to replace lucrative oil sector jobs.
4824 2018-08-30 15:35:13 Oh yeah this is democracy, sponsored by Russia and a greasy snake oil salesman called Aaron banks and half the right wing Conservative party

4836 2018-08-30 15:34:21 I realise it's a typo. Still.  Extreme Unction is the anointing with oil.  It is part of Last Rites, but those include other things, most importantly the viaticum (i.e.  giving the dying person communion).   A "good death" for a Catholic would be Penance, Anointing, Viaticum.
4837 2018-08-30 15:34:12 Really?  I’m not promoting oil industry but you have zero idea how many products you use every day rely on petroleum. Everything plastic, being able to travel, cosmetics etc etc etc. the list is a mile long and you would miss it. We would live like the 1930s without it

4840 2018-08-30 15:34:07 Baby oil be messy as a bitch
4841 2018-08-30 15:33:52 Ya, the mood in this sector just didn't feel right. Took the chance to sell high. Will reassess again over the next few months.  Believe oil is going lower from here.
4842 2018-08-30 15:33:51 Getting an oil change is always riveting. To be in the same arena as these car guys, aka men, with my little coupon in hand, I mean I don’t even stand a chance
4843 2018-08-30 15:33:50 That and it could very well have been that KM had already come to the conclusion that the Asian markets for the world's most expensive oil were not going to be there on a scale justifying the original business model. Feds were deus ex machina for KM.

4845 2018-08-30 15:33:43 Convinced 50% of my children that cabbage is delicious. Made Bubble & Squeak* like my Ouma used to make, as a side dish for dinner. Toffee gobbled it down.

*Sliced onion+cabbage fried in sunflower oil+garlic until soft. Add cubed parboiled potatoes+bacon, cook until golden.
4846 2018-08-30 15:33:43 Hahaha. A product that cannot be proven or disproven in this world. Great snake oil you have. Just be nice to people and get rid of all the pedophiles in your organization. That will help. Selling snake oils is useless.

4849 2018-08-30 15:33:11 He's very similar to Jordan Peterson. Both practice the "I didn't say that" when caught in paradoxes and change the subject. They're aspiring con artists cum cult leaders, very much akin to the snake oil Trump himself sells.

4852 2018-08-30 15:32:58 Question:  How many of you believe in the value of using CBD oil (legal in all states) for your pets and/or for yourself?  Would love to know....
4853 2018-08-30 15:32:57 Have you tried CBD oil for that? I’ve heard it’s excellent for nerve pain.
4854 2018-08-30 15:32:56 Stop using your own negative words for the oil sands.
4855 2018-08-30 15:32:55 BAM! We'll have to ship the oil by train, next derailment is on Greenpeace.
4856 2018-08-30 15:32:38 Ohhhh kita pakai body shop yang tea tree oil tu.
4857 2018-08-30 15:32:33 I hope so, but if you're living in EU, like here in UK, GM foods are not acceptable. Remember coconut oil (although not GM), Philippines and other countries producing them said they're good but US said they're bad for health. Sometimes studies are biased on business interests.
4858 2018-08-30 15:32:25 I’d forgotten about oiling the tortoise. When I was a child the only place you could buy olive oil was Boots the chemist. It came in tiny bottles and we’d rub it on her shell.
4859 2018-08-30 15:32:23 Moral hazard ... bailing out an oil company poised for years in litigation was just not a smart business move. To be sandwiched between two NDP governments but decide to go against BC when that's where Liberal voters are ... also horrible political calculation.
4860 2018-08-30 15:32:13 An Armada of French ships just tackled some of our fishing boats, even flared one of them n burnt it and i have to physically search to find anything on the subject. You know why? it's not in the status quo to promote it as it doesn't lead to escalation or tensions that give oil.

4870 2018-08-30 15:31:24 As someone who is invested in Oil, this could take a hit to my portfolio. On the otherhand Canada now owns the pipeline, so we are all screwed.
4871 2018-08-30 15:31:20 This is price we pay for our virtue. The @liberal_party climate plan is built around containing growth in the oil sands. Their support of #TMX was grudging & halfhearted.

4873 2018-08-30 15:31:16 Canada's Federal Court of Appeal on Thursday quashed the approval of the contentious Trans Mountain pipeline expansion that would nearly triple the flow of oil from the Alberta oil sands to the Pacific Coast.

4891 2018-08-30 15:30:08 Davis. They wouldn't care. Their only goal is to keep oil in the ground in Canada, and will say any lie to achieved that end.
4892 2018-08-30 15:30:04 Thanks for weighing in, Mike! Great point, but stopping Canada's supply chain does nothing to impact global demand. People will still use oil products, except now they'll get them from less regulated markets. I'm 100% onboard for a carbon tax since that changes consumer behaviour
4893 2018-08-30 15:30:04 Wrong. It wakes people up. And rail can't supply the same volume. The end of oil has to happen, and this will be where that starts.
Wouldn't you rather see Reserves get clean water? Or a renewable energy industry that will employ and enrich many more people? No brainer IMO
4894 2018-08-30 15:30:01 Where’d all that money   come from then? 

You’re all snake oil salesmen- only perverts as well.

4896 2018-08-30 15:29:50 You are right. Oil production without adherence to the relevant legal frameworks is worrying to say the least
4897 2018-08-30 15:29:50 Water and oil don't mix.
4898 2018-08-30 15:29:48 Norway has plenty of oil and gas. They also have a population smaller than that of the GTA. They would have to as stupid and corrupt as Canada not to be successful.
4899 2018-08-30 15:29:46 Go a week without engaging with an oil company in some way, and I'll vote for whoever you'd like for the rest of my life.  Any company you use uses the products and services of other companies. It's a web no consumer, no employee, no human, can untangle.

4902 2018-08-30 15:29:28 I sent emails to SKY, BBC, ITV and a couple of national press agencies. Maybe we have a fish on the hook for national coverage. Doubt if SWAMPIES are involved -their court result is next Monday. ( Management of Traffic Act 2004, will defeat them)

4910 2018-08-30 15:28:58 This probably pre-dates USA sabotage of Saddam Hussein trading oil in Euros as Russia supported unified Germany which Americans tried to prevent after collapse of USSR. Germany & Russia has been US biggest fear. Paid Hitler to break alliance with Stalin during WW2. Divide & conq.

4914 2018-08-30 15:28:33 When a Liberian tanker full of Saudi oil, without local pilots or escort tugs, founders in the San Juans we will be able to say wistfully that the resident orcas weren't killed by us. This decision means more less-regulated foreign tankers #bcpoli #cdnpoli @keithbaldrey @sjmuir
4915 2018-08-30 15:28:29 Another implication: what a remarkably epic failure of the Canadian system of regulation. All that time and effort by so many parties, and we’re essentially back to square one on dealing with the challenge of oil sands market access, and more generally the future of the oil sands
4916 2018-08-30 15:28:21 I'm constantly amazed that we haven't fought harder to push pipelines out to the Atlantic. Simply can't believe that Canada actually imports oil.

4919 2018-08-30 15:28:15 Canadians are eating their own!  Consultation with every indigenous person is impossible. All subsidies to indigenous initiatives should be tied to the difference in price that Canadian Oil is sold to the Us and what it could be sold to other countries.
4920 2018-08-30 15:27:56 Sold $BTE at open and sold $ARX as well. Will continue to scale out of my O&G holdings. Things are about to get much worse for the Canadian O&G sector. 4 more years of Trudeau is a guarantee with Bernier's actions. Not to mention a short term top has likely been made in oil.

4934 2018-08-30 15:26:29 Russian oil money funding match fixing again?
4935 2018-08-30 15:26:29 씨익씨익,,,, 전 유키나 못데려왔다구요!!!  흑흑
4936 2018-08-30 15:26:24 I suspect Kinney will help your cause next year, by limiting oil sales to BC.

Let us know how that works out.
4937 2018-08-30 15:26:23 Pass em this way!  I mostly use oil but I like sprays
4938 2018-08-30 15:26:22 Name?  Greg Wesson.  How do you spell that?  W E S S O N.  Oh, like the oil!  No, like the gun.
4939 2018-08-30 15:26:20 Fear not - Canada will be in position to access global oil markets 2 weeks prior to them no longer needing it.  Anyone wanting to start a business in Canada should just.......stop.

4944 2018-08-30 15:25:53 As a follow-up, when a Liberian tanker full of Saudi oil, with no local pilots or escort tugs, founders in the San Juans we will be able to say wistfully that the whales weren't killed by us. Less safe foreign tankers are the consequence of this decision #bcpoli #cdnpoli
4945 2018-08-30 15:25:46 I think your machine is down a couple of cans of oil
4946 2018-08-30 15:25:38 There are refineries and Alberta has a cheaper gas than BC, 20c cheaper per litre. But we as a nation spend a fortune each year on US and Saudi oil because we can’t transport our own.

4954 2018-08-30 15:25:01 The damage he has done will take far longer than another one term government as well. So discouraging to see our country continuously mess this up. Let’s keep letting everyone who doesn’t care about people at all bring all their oil to us at much higher prices. #TrudeauMustGo

4959 2018-08-30 15:23:55 Melatonin my dude. Take one like 30 mins to an hour before you wanna be asleep. It helps. Essential oil defusers help too.
4960 2018-08-30 15:23:49 so excited for my cbd oil to come 
4961 2018-08-30 15:23:44 The flower is way too much work for me. Grinding, rolling, keeping it dry etc. Just give me the oil and a pen and I'm good. The smell also doesn't linger w/ that method either.
4962 2018-08-30 15:23:39 We subsidize tax breaks, farmers, oil companies and a bunch of corporate socialists in this country so what’s wrong with helping hard working Americans? Wake up people!
4963 2018-08-30 15:23:39 Oil change  
Nails done  
Dads birthday plans made 
And it's before 10:30 go me 
4964 2018-08-30 15:23:18 Moroccan oil smells so good
4965 2018-08-30 15:22:59 So now we own the pipeline and the oil in it. What's the problem? Im cool with that. You  rather an American company own it??
4966 2018-08-30 15:22:46 How long before the Burnaby plant is closed? That 4.9 billion will still be on the books. Look at history, the Liberals buying into the oil patch never works out well for taxpayers.
4967 2018-08-30 15:22:46 WHY IS MY CBD OIL SO HARD TO OPEN YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE HELPING ME WITH MY ANXIETY NOT JUMP STARTING IT.
4968 2018-08-30 15:22:42 Lol I told my dad I was getting my oil changed today and he legit chased me out the door begging to do it for me and there is no better man on planet earth then him
4969 2018-08-30 15:22:37 Meaningful products that make sense is good. Blowing gas exhaust out your tail pipe stuck in rush hour or lineup at Timmy’s for a $2 coffee is NOT cool. We should all pay a gas tax premium to waste oil out our tailpipes where clearly we have much greener options.
4970 2018-08-30 15:22:33 They really getting my coins if I was not going out of town I wouldve walked out with my oil change only
4971 2018-08-30 15:22:23 @Heid_oil ....  Film at HH gate....I emailed each TV media last week, attaching the H H video of the three oil bottles plus details. Received an acknowledgement from SKY and BBC. Has one realised a TV scoop is possible?

4976 2018-08-30 15:21:58 @TomBales1 good morning Tom!   It is a good morning in our little province of BC. Our FederalGovts bailout of a Texas Oil co pipeline project was sadly, for Cdns, for not but our environment gets a reprieve. 
4977 2018-08-30 15:21:56 I wish the government would use the notwithstanding clause to overrule this judgement, if they could at least, we need more markets for our oil, especially in this current climate.

4991 2018-08-30 15:20:56 Cho Sangho; the Ministers of Transportation, or the Oil and Gas Commission since the Premier and her government to recognize that the 1/3
4992 2018-08-30 15:20:56 Oil will go higher....but refiners and marketers will give Americans a Labor day respite.  Eventually.....steadying in this range is politically correct.
Margins are fine right here.
4993 2018-08-30 15:20:55 Binghamton(both the town and university) was kinda loose and liberal in the late 80's...early 90's.  Too much dope and patchouli oil.
4994 2018-08-30 15:20:50 Koch money came from setting up RUSSIAN (USSR) oil industry,yet they are against COMMUNISM?
4995 2018-08-30 15:20:48 Yes and the right’s scaremongering about “globalism” is an attempt to derail that so that the dirty oil economy can continue.  But there are ALSO legitimate issues and fears underlying opposition to internationalism and immigration, it’s not easy to sort out.
4996 2018-08-30 15:20:36 If Trump wanted things done differently? He SHOULD have KEPT JCPOA. Requested FORMAL meeting 2 C IF? Other changes were possible? But,2BULLY Iran& BULLY others. To STOP oil export&doing business with Iran. indicate Israel has d LAST word in Trump administration. So,WHY negotiate?
4997 2018-08-30 15:20:34 Honestly when oil depletes this is going to be the best thing that has ever happened.The world would be so much cleaner.More companies should start investing into renewable energy.Also our increasing heatwaves would slowly plummet. Paris climate agreement was a wasted opportunity
4998 2018-08-30 15:20:13 Awesome  make sure you check the oil often once you’re driving it - zetec’s are good engines but they do tend to burn a bit of oil!
4999 2018-08-30 15:20:02 Harpers rigging the courts has paid off in spades with the CPC American friends retaining thier huge profits over western Canadian oil.WHY not lay that pipe from Mcmurray to CHurchill and ship our oil 10 months of the year.
5000 2018-08-30 15:20:02 I was in Venezuela in April 2008. Tourism held so much opportunity to diversify the economy away from oil, but Chavez insisted on pushing out the private sector and nationalising. Now poverty is the only equality they can brag about.
5001 2018-08-30 15:19:55 てらありー
5002 2018-08-30 15:19:49 I know the governments want to seem all supportive of Alberta and Saskatchewan and support the NDP government in Edmonton but time to say we tried, the oil industry's days are numbered, we no longer can support such projects.
5003 2018-08-30 15:19:31 ... with people jumping ship, left and right... not to mention those who’ve pleaded guilty or who have been indicted and/or convicted. Maybe you should apply a little more of your snake oil to that machine of yours... 
5004 2018-08-30 15:19:29 Have  you ever tried coconut oil and baking soda?
5005 2018-08-30 15:19:22 True because India is domestic driven country mostly not depend imports so the impact is less, he strategically not reducing the oil price,
5006 2018-08-30 15:19:16 Curbelo, you craven, political opportunist; sad you didn't have a formidable opponent in the Primaries. You know damn well that Rep. DeSantis meant NO racial animus. Voting for you, to keep the House Red, will be as repugnant as taking Castor Oil!
5007 2018-08-30 15:19:15 “Hippy oil” 
5008 2018-08-30 15:19:06 An excellent decision!  Will @JustinTrudeau now choose to put $4.5 billion into sustainable energy and move us along the appropriate 21st century path away from dependence on oil?
5009 2018-08-30 15:19:04 Oil and water DO NOT mix! 

In other words make sure the people you ALLOW in your business have the same hustle as you!

5019 2018-08-30 15:18:04 we dont believe modi,rahul or jailtley&amitshaw. but we strongly believe that  modi govt utterly failed. High oil prices, demonetization& Raffel deal corruption are true. Lacks of small scale industries&traders are routed. crores of farmers on roads. In total,Indians are looted.
5020 2018-08-30 15:18:03 "halt on project indefinitely"? You should add "so that we can buy more oil from Saudi Arabia" the country that beheads women! I'm very proud of you @ElizabethMay
5021 2018-08-30 15:18:02 OIL OIL OIL OIL OIL and US imperialism.
5022 2018-08-30 15:17:59 It's not even that big of a business but CAPP has been lying and bribing for years to convince Canadians that without oil Canada's economy would collapse meanwhile the royalties and taxes they pay shrink
5023 2018-08-30 15:17:51 Except... when your narcotics business, which became a necessity after your funding requirements overshot anything justifiable from federal budgets, gets so big you actually have more power and reason to control source countries, than even the oil / MIC-representing US Govt.
5024 2018-08-30 15:17:43 The interest rates are unrealistically high, often countries reimburse debt in assets such as cobalt or oil.
5025 2018-08-30 15:17:37 It’s not tho. I understand you’re rooting for TB and I am to. I wish He went to a team where he could come in and compete but he’s going to be good. Saints got them one they can keep in the shop, put brand new oil, paint it, tighten everything up until their reliable car breaks.
5026 2018-08-30 15:17:36 Feels weird to say this, but it looks like one of those hyperrealistic oil paintings to me.
5027 2018-08-30 15:17:21 This makes the NEB error pretty stark: "[Canada and Transmountain] submit that the Board reasonably concluded that the increase in marine shipping was not part of the designated project."  The project is/was literally about shipping more oil out of Canada, most of it by ship.
5028 2018-08-30 15:17:15 Look, when I move somewhere without Bolton Oil I’m gonna be so sad. It’s seriously the most convenient and easy oil change and inspection ever.
5029 2018-08-30 15:17:12 Gonna fly your oil out are ya?? Lol. You dont own the railroad, or the land it will travel on. Good luck with that. Im for the pipeline, all fed gov's have tried. Its the hypocrites that use oil and are protesting is your enemy...not Canada!
5030 2018-08-30 15:17:08 Dripped gear oil on my pants so now it’ll look like I pissed myself for all eternity.
5031 2018-08-30 15:17:02 I need someone to translate for me pls
5032 2018-08-30 15:16:51 The time to nationalize the oil industry was back in the 1930s, when it just so happened that the CCF recommended it. Now, all we have is Justin Trudeau giving away 4.5 billion for a #TransMountain #pipeline that can't be built because he forgot indigenous people matter.
5033 2018-08-30 15:16:51 Chicken Oil, Wings 'n' More, Double Dave's, Freebirds.
5034 2018-08-30 15:16:48 Energy East was never designed to do that. It was designed to export Canadian oil from an oversupplied North American market. Why would it be helpful to Canadian producers to continue to sell at a discount in that market?

5037 2018-08-30 15:16:34 Lots of people and countries, given most of the world's population still use energy they provide. Don't worry I'm sure we can buy enough Saudi oil to fill our energy needs.
5038 2018-08-30 15:16:31 They were after you, the last 40 years, just made you pay more and more taxes, more for energy, oil, drugs,  they robbed  you/ us blind.
5039 2018-08-30 15:16:25 I see the Harper,Kenney,CPC interference in Nafta and Kinder - morgan has paid off with The trans mountain squashed  and Albertans religated to providing huge profits to Harper and Kenneys American friends.Harpers hatred of Trudeau is to the detriment of alberta oil interests.
5040 2018-08-30 15:16:22 Could bring jobs to Canada. We need to start refining our own products..... Especially oil. What's the alternative? But it off the Saudis?

5042 2018-08-30 15:16:22 ...today and the main contentious issues bother on the high percentage of fees being demanded by the agencies managing the revenue collections on oil sales on behalf of the govt. When they blow the whistle tomorrow, pple like u will also say Buhari is collecting commission. FAKE.
5043 2018-08-30 15:16:12 I blame GW. Bush & Blair friend to killer global dictatorships. #WMD divvying up #Iraq oils fields into US, UK, Fr & Ger private oil companies, coupled to Al Saud funded Wahhabi sectarian killings, up to 2007 until Shia Govt replaced & oils fields handed over. You #Newsnight?
5044 2018-08-30 15:16:11 Pipeline adversaries keep saying the environment and indigenous groups are going to suffer at the expense of #TransMountain . Canada needs to challenge their way of thinking by showing the risk of shipping oil the same way, using intl markets, and how the energy sectors helps FNs
5045 2018-08-30 15:15:48 We are one of the biggest clubs in the world and yet we buy second or third tier players. We cannot compete with the oil rich club owners because we have the glazers bleeding the club dry year after year. They have never backed the club with their own money.
5046 2018-08-30 15:15:47 From what I've found, he was forced into attacking Poland, who were killing Germans in Kaliningrad [E Prussia at time] The British used it as an excuse to go to war! What resources was he short of?
Oil for his planes he bought from Standard oil.
Vehicles he bought from Ford.
5047 2018-08-30 15:15:46 Whip together 4 1/2 tbsps catfish with 3 cups chimichanga. Add generous amounts of Olive Oil. Boil. Serve for brunch
5048 2018-08-30 15:15:36 There are things going on under the table that I fear we will never know. The corruption surrounding oil and gas and our govt. is so profound.

5052 2018-08-30 15:15:26 gotta get a oil change and a brake light fixed today 
5053 2018-08-30 15:15:22 The BC climate warriors will all be celebration a victory over the scuppering of #TMX. Meanwhile, investment in our resource sector will atrophy but oil-by-rail will prosper. Tailpipe emissions in #YVR fuelled by gasoline from Anacortes WA will be unmoved. Gong show indeed, Gary.
5054 2018-08-30 15:15:20 Don’t mess w/karma. Walking into a garage to get my oil changed & lady almost pushed me to get in before me. She went to talk to the guy about what was wrong w/her car & he said they wouldn’t be able to help her until next week at the earliest even though she took time off work.
5055 2018-08-30 15:15:07 We are past NEEDING oil on such scales -- why can't we (humans) start proactively leaning towards cleaner energy?
I'm not naive, it won't happen over night, but goodness, it's so doable.
5056 2018-08-30 15:15:07 By doing what? Letting us pay less for the gas? Giving a source of income? China will get their oil anyway as they need it. You’re free to go there and protest, but you’ll end up in a concentration camp finding yourself building a pipeline or coal plant as a prisoner.
5057 2018-08-30 15:15:06 Oil change and car wash done
5058 2018-08-30 15:15:03 Just like Rick's first fantasy draft when he selected Beattie Feathers in the glow of an oil lantern.
5059 2018-08-30 15:14:58 Disgusting.  Had one at the OC fair.  And they served it with olive oil dip.  Oil on oil on oil.  Blech.
5060 2018-08-30 15:14:58 ugh i spilt a bunch of coconut oil on the floor yesterday and now the bathroom smells like old coconut (not good) and half of the floor is extremely slippery
5061 2018-08-30 15:14:54 This guy gave me a free oil change and taught me stuff about my car. I must be an adult because that made me SO happy.

5063 2018-08-30 15:14:52 you know sometimes when you go to do something and you stop right before you do and go "no, this plate should go in the dishwasher not the trash" or you put the olive oil in the fridge? cuz this morning i found the olive oil in the fridge
5064 2018-08-30 15:14:48 without any synthetic additives??? I've been to Piedmont, Tuscany and Umbria and have yet to see one... oil is a fairly useless way to preserve the aroma of truffles - I welcome photos of bottles including ingredient lists.

5066 2018-08-30 15:14:41 Its a guju/east african dish. It's basically steamed mogo then in another pan oil, cumin, salt, fresh green chilli/garlic/ginger in a creamed coconut sauce and  crushed skinless peanuts.

5068 2018-08-30 15:14:36 Olive Oil could have lost it all, shoveling in the deep.
5069 2018-08-30 15:14:27 I really wish we could get off of oil! It’s very bad for the environment but it’s BIG BUSINESS and we all know how that influences governments
5070 2018-08-30 15:14:15 Don’t know if you’re able to travel abroad but the oil and gas industry in the states needs hands like yesterday.

i feel like a damn wobbly mobile home lmao
5080 2018-08-30 15:13:11 @RachelNotley I'm a supporter but we need to cut BC off oil now. I am mad at the foolishness of the BC government.

5082 2018-08-30 15:12:52 Distributed from England? England getting revenue from Scots produce.
Over 40 years Westminster revenue from Scots oil.
Your ‘English taxes’ wouldn’t cover spending in England never mind spending in Scotland.
Why won’t UK elite let Scotland go if we’re such a burden?
5083 2018-08-30 15:12:52 Actually yeah I’m vaping till she’s better. I ingest cbd/thc oil but I’m also out of that at the moment.
5084 2018-08-30 15:12:44 Ooo, I have a treasure for you re. add oil!  So the word hilaros (which is where God loves a cheerful giver, it is the cheerful part).  I did a word study that led to a similar turn of phrase in the OT--it meant to cause to shine, to anoint with oil.  So you see the treasure??
5085 2018-08-30 15:12:43 On a given my hair only sees my Jamaican mango and lime locking gel and my homemade coconut oil
5086 2018-08-30 15:12:38 "Great" news for the environment and indigenous groups today! Now Canada can ship oil dangerously by rail, rely on unethical, less regulated markets, to fill intl. demand, and not provide jobs/$ to First Nations along the #TransMountain through Mutually-Beneficial Agreements.

5090 2018-08-30 15:12:25 That and imported oil, because that’s better for the country than buying locally apparently
5091 2018-08-30 15:12:20 I didn’t wanna get up early to get  my oil changed but I just found $5 on the ground so I guess it all worked out 
5092 2018-08-30 15:12:10 Also, instead of using our own resources, we will continue to bring in Saudi oil and sell ours for pennies on the dollar. Enlighten me on how that makes sense for Canada.
5093 2018-08-30 15:12:07 While you were buying bigger pickups with the oil money, we built hydro dams. Goodbye.
5094 2018-08-30 15:11:52 @HawaiianT_UK the dry spray oil is shite! Makes you feel greasy, if you can even get it to spray as it turns into a gel in the bottle - garbage

2) Add a tablespoon of olive oil and two pinches of salt
3) Add quinoa to pan and cook at slow simmer for twenty minutes
4) Throw away as good for nothing

5103 2018-08-30 15:11:06 Oh look, the Canadian economic numbers are being propped up by oil & gas exports, the very industry you’re actively destroying. #LiberalLogic

5107 2018-08-30 15:10:49 Lmao so my boss saw me on the forklift and came out to see if I lost the oil filter he said I though u where going get the old guy to take out there I said u forgot who my dad is huh ....he said u know what I'm go back inside
5108 2018-08-30 15:10:43 Drink oil..? that doesn't even make sense. Actually, I'm pretty tired of Alberta paying for Canada to survive and getting nothing but neglect back.
5109 2018-08-30 15:10:39 I want to treat myself to a fancy bath oil. Any suggestions? #bbloggers
5110 2018-08-30 15:10:35 But you agreed...it won’t get us off Oil. It would just divert to another source (OPEC). Your talking in circles now. Remember, The pipeline decision doesn’t stop Oil extraction it just makes them use an alternative transportation source (rail).

5126 2018-08-30 15:09:34 In twenty years we may look back at this judicial ruling and view it as the moment Canadians collectively decided respect for first nations and the environment was a priority. We may also see this ruling as a time when we accelerated our efforts to move away from oil.
5127 2018-08-30 15:09:20 I so glad the country is doing so great keep up the good job. Now can you do something to help us seniors as we don't get any raises vut our cost keep going up. Also what with th gas prices i though we were using our oil should that lower our prices.

This is why trump did his little sword dance and sold 110 Billion $$ worth of weapons to the Kingdom of Saud.

5146 2018-08-30 15:07:40 Should we stop all marine traffic on the west coast like ferries, oil product imports, cruise ships & cargo ships?

We must consider all marine traffic equally for potential environmental impact.

5157 2018-08-30 15:07:01 @RELEVANTpodcast you talked about hot boxing with essential oils, but the way Daswick talked about being “so relaxed” I have a feeling you had a “different” oil in there ;)

5159 2018-08-30 15:06:59 I've stopped buying biscuits containing palm oil; there are alternatives on offer in the supermarket if you look closely.
5160 2018-08-30 15:06:57 Apparently one reason that Trans Mountain pipeline was stalled by the courts was NEB didn't take into account the marine risk of tanker travel. Really? Then we should see a fast track of Energy East to stop Saudi Arabia tankers & their conflict oil. #cdnpoli #skpoli #abpoli
5161 2018-08-30 15:06:55 I have been making dubious noises about Solo Oil and their ability to pay their way in Ruvuma with Aminex. Am delighted for our partners if today’s news means they are sorted for the next drill and around for a big pay-day. They deserve it.
5162 2018-08-30 15:06:51 Iranian people should wish George bush was president , he allowed sale of oil for food and medicine, today neocon and trump attempt to close every loophole , to starve Iranian people, not understanding Irani people only rise against the corrupted regime when they have better life
5163 2018-08-30 15:06:48 He is a classic snake oil salesman. His non-wealthy supporters are viewed as targets to dupe into supporting the interests of his wealthy donors.
5164 2018-08-30 15:06:31 ? People talk about their lack of profits all the time. Their margins are thin. If oil spikes their whole business model could be at risk if it becomes cheaper to buy at a store than have every $15 package delivered to you in 2 days for free.
5165 2018-08-30 15:06:26 Every time I get my oil changed I sit and wait terrified they're gonna tell me something is horribly wrong with my car and it's not drivable and I'll probably die next time I get in it
5166 2018-08-30 15:06:26 (oh and olive oil obvs, and some cheese on at the end)
5167 2018-08-30 15:06:24 It sounds like you're taking this particular situation with building an oil pipeline in BC and generalizing the issue to all business projects in Canada.

Is that an appropriate generalization?
5168 2018-08-30 15:06:16 Doesn't matter anymore.  Crude by rail is the future.  It is a done deal.  There will NEVER be any more new investment in pipeline projects.  It doesn't matter anymore! It is OVER! Canada will keep selling it's oil to the USA at a deep discount. Stuck forever together!

5172 2018-08-30 15:06:09 Next up - oil to Saudi Arabia, maybe? Make a change from arms.
5173 2018-08-30 15:06:09 Pipeline blunder! Sure let's keep wasting billions on Saudi oil while a handful of misguided people on the west coast hold up the delivery of Canadian oil to market as they extort yet more $$ from tax payers. Sooo fed up with the "tail wagging the dog" mentality in CDN.
5174 2018-08-30 15:06:07 อยากฟังแล้วว
5175 2018-08-30 15:06:04 Ok, so now what? Oil will continue to be transported by rail? Lac megantic? Surely there r compromises here for both sides? Sufficient environmental protections & regs. It doesn’t guarantee a spill but neither does having it transported by rail or other means across the country.
5176 2018-08-30 15:06:04 I emailed each TV media last week attaching the three oil bottle video from Horse Hill. I received an acknowledgement. Has TV finall taken an interest in this potential massive oil discovery?

5181 2018-08-30 15:05:41 I came to this shop to get an oil change not for these people to try to find other stuff that could be wrong with my car
5182 2018-08-30 15:05:32 The reasons why are irrelevant.
If you can't recognize that the need to get off of oil as fast as possible is imperative to human survival ... well, I'll just leave it at that. I don't think I need to say anything else.
5183 2018-08-30 15:05:27 Who in their right mind would invest any monies in this country. We go out of our way to undermine our own regulatory process which causes extreme uncertainty. Not just an oil and gas problem...
5184 2018-08-30 15:05:23 No to vets, no to oil. A banner day for the courts.
5185 2018-08-30 15:05:18 Right...what you need to do is, wash it every other day for 2 weeks. Then try every 3 days for 3 weeks and if you can handle it every 4 days for 4 weeks. It’s just retraining your scalp to slow down the oil production. I can sometimes go 7-9 days without washing mine!!

5190 2018-08-30 15:04:49 #TransMountain I feel vindicated in my decision to reject 2 offers (1 from an FN & the other from an ENGO) to serve as an Expert Witness on the marine oil spill aspects of the project review. I found the EA process to be so flawed that I basically refused to have any part of it.

5195 2018-08-30 15:04:18 Modi knows it very well. The demand is high, so the price is hiking day by day of oil. I think that it will not be long time.
5196 2018-08-30 15:04:08 Can't all have questionably sourced oil money coming out of our noses, must be nice! You lot just need to build a fanbase to match your success now and you're all set!

5203 2018-08-30 15:03:13 “You better not tear up the deal Trump, or we won’t sell you oil anymore”.... actually no, says the courts, 24 hours from the deadline. Great. Lol.
5204 2018-08-30 15:03:13 Such a potent read. Exactly what is going on in so very many countries . A wise teacher told me years ago, stop thinking in terms of countries. It is cartels who r in turf wars. Oil & weapons cartels in a turf war is what I see.
5205 2018-08-30 15:03:01 Still trying to figure out what caused that. I very rarely deal with pimples that form like those did. I use tea tree oil on blemishes and it usually works wonders. I googled it and it seems others have had similar issues, but only on the forehead. Hm... 
5206 2018-08-30 15:02:53 Today's the perfect day to just reach out there and grab ahold of life, coincidently my hands have oil, melted butter, grease, sweat, basically anything that's a good lubricant. This makes sense. It's fine, I'm fine.

5213 2018-08-30 15:02:30 I keep neem oil on hand all the time.
5214 2018-08-30 15:02:30 Hannah how do you feel about exploiting other coasts for California needs? Where do you suggest we get our oil from? Here’s a suggestion. Let’s make electric cars cheaper with better tax incentives. Let’s give bigger tax breaks to electric car manufacturers.

5216 2018-08-30 15:02:23 "They are taught that westerners owe them everything." Per Qur'an (their man made "holy" book), they have believed, (for 1400 years--long before oil production) that ALL unbelievers owe them everything.
5217 2018-08-30 15:02:15 Not good news for indigenous women who choose to work in oil industry to escape the chains of poverty.
5218 2018-08-30 15:02:03 If you bothered to read or can read the oversight was a failure to include tanker traffic in their proposal. Nothing to do with the Oil Sands and their environmental impact. So your statement is not only stupid but it undermines your integrity on the issue. Try and keep up.
5219 2018-08-30 15:01:48 If it wasn't for these bought players, these "oil rich" and "talent deficit" countries would have been nowhere on the medal table
5220 2018-08-30 15:01:31 Oil should be cheaper then?

5222 2018-08-30 15:01:14 Went camping last weekend. Made a conscious effort to not touch my face w dirty hands. Did really well considering the crazy breakout that formed on the car ride down >_< my forehead was covered in huge oil bubbles deep under the skin. But I didn’t pick at em! Not even once!

5226 2018-08-30 15:00:45 So we going back to basics. Good. Next we need to start supplying the canteens with rice, sugar, flour, bulgar, butter oil and milk powder like it was in the 70's
5227 2018-08-30 15:00:44 No fun!! I’ll pray, and I’ll also share the Chinese phrase my mom says to me when I’m working through something miserable: “Jah yoh!” 

It literally means “add oil” but it’s used as a cheer, a “keep going! you can do it!” sentiment.

But if you can’t, that’s ok too.

5232 2018-08-30 15:00:33 I’m confident there are some helped by the oil. I find I just want to vote against it for the tactic that some are using shaming LDS members & the Faith  for having an opinion. It’s a crap show.

5239 2018-08-30 15:00:17 Exactly Andrea! I spent 12 years there and none of the problems arose from socialism; they arose from greed of a select few and mismanagement of oil resources... well, among other things. Vzla that I knew was NOT socialist.
5240 2018-08-30 15:00:09 There are many different types of house paint, but most fall into one of two categories: oil and water. They differ mostly in their drying processes, ease of cleanup, and finishes.

5253 2018-08-30 14:59:05 Its unreal. Courts always side with special interest groups funded by Anti oil groups from u.s.  Always want gov money but don't let gov make money. This country is going for shit fast....
5254 2018-08-30 14:59:04 Meanwhile 67 millions gallons of gas were saved . That’s about 1.5 millions barrels of oil worth 143 millions dollars . Money lost by oil cartels . 92.5 millions of barrels are extracted daily !!!

5262 2018-08-30 14:58:32 Gotta remember just how big these energy companies are, oil, gas, or otherwise. We’re talking 20,000 employee companies.

A large % of the employees aren’t “energy finance” or “energy IT” or “energy HR” professionals, the types of which would probably have strong political bias.

5268 2018-08-30 14:58:09 TY! Stock art background was flat, my oil painting was more three dimensional to start with. So, all that was necessary was a slight shadow effect for top layer (crow). I erased part of the claws to get it to align with the clock hands. Fast easy project overall (I was happy!).

5278 2018-08-30 14:57:16 Thank you so much, that's lovely to hear! Hmm it's a tough one as everyone's style differs, I tend to go very light and get the shape and definition right then really work the malleable oil pastel into the area, warming it up a little first can help if it's not the softest pastel
5279 2018-08-30 14:57:10 Hope you're OK now? How did they remove the oil?
5280 2018-08-30 14:57:05 Crude oil is going to $80. From $69 in January. Who would have thought? The govt is going to be so happy.
5281 2018-08-30 14:56:59 The small amount of palm oil used is part of another ingredient which is used to aid with crumb quality and the palm oil within this makes up less than 0.05% of the final product.

5294 2018-08-30 14:55:56 indigenous ppl have prevented huge oil spills and catastrophic damage to local ecosystems and protected their water and land and you can write THAT in the history books

5313 2018-08-30 14:53:59 Yeahhhh Oil pastels was always one of my favourite media at college!  I used to love copying Lucien Freud oil paintings in my sketchbook with the pastels.
5314 2018-08-30 14:53:59 Hell yeah. I’m getting the oil change, tune up, brakes & rotors & the damn tint. Especially when He doing deals like this!!
5315 2018-08-30 14:53:50 Stick a fork in it, Derek. #TMX is cooked. BC & TROC now a NO GO zone for resource extraction investors. CEOs of Suncor & Imperial Oil have recently been warning their investors that we are becoming increasingly hostile to their industry.
5316 2018-08-30 14:53:48 Oil accounts for under 10% of our GDP. This ruling isn't fantastic, but it holds the government to account and requires consultation, which IS a great thing. Indigenous nations need more say. #TransMountain #cdnpoli

5324 2018-08-30 14:53:24 It doesnt stay like that. It gets reclaimed. This is actually like an oil spill clean up. Take top layer off. Take sand sand wash and put back. Spread over burden and replant. Your perspective is like that of a religious fanatic. You are only looking at it from one side.
5325 2018-08-30 14:53:23 Hi, can you tell me how the oil or 'heavy fluid' is removed please?
5326 2018-08-30 14:53:20 Great! US oil companies can celebrate now. How much grants did they send to our “activists”?
5327 2018-08-30 14:53:18 What to use in Lieu of Pesticides? Neem Oil, Garlic & Clove Oil, Azatrol, StrawFlower Extract... the list goes on!
5328 2018-08-30 14:53:14 Good morning 

Needed the oil to speed process and get a nice tan
5329 2018-08-30 14:53:11 Oil changes on super cars like lamborghini’s run you about 400 dollars thats crazy  almost absurd
5330 2018-08-30 14:53:11 67 millions gallons of gas saved .thats about 143 million dollars taken away from oil industry .
5331 2018-08-30 14:53:09 I’m sure your hair will be beautiful. Of course I use a little bit of coconut oil, I would recommend a leave in conditioner with aloe, shea butter, and MY FAVORITE product for the curls themselves has been Aunt Jackie’s Curls & Coils
5332 2018-08-30 14:53:03 @RachelNotley sorry Rachel and @YourAlberta but the project was flawed from the start and would have never moved any oil. It’s not to late to transition to a green energy economy
5333 2018-08-30 14:52:59 Well there goes #Jobs in Alberta, and in B.C., and the prospect for #Domestic oil in Canada, because a bunch of emotionally disturbed, environmental hippies would rather want Canada to be #SubjectandSubservient to #Foreign oil, like those imported from Saudi Arabia.

5336 2018-08-30 14:52:32 ...and it’s a GOV subsidized fuel unlike Oil. It decreases fuel mileage cost more to process and pollutes more per gallon then does oil.
5337 2018-08-30 14:52:31 No you didn't! No one won, unless you want health care in the sewer, highways that r not fit to drive, reduced services in just about every department. $ from oil keep a lot of this going.  Wake Up!
5338 2018-08-30 14:52:29 if I were running an oil company, I'd invest in places like Nigeria, cozy up to Saudi Arabia, and try to push carbon tax to stifle supply in Canada, where I had no investments

5352 2018-08-30 14:51:08 I knew when I looked up at Faux News while I was getting my oil changed, and they were trashing Howard Zinn. I was all, WHAT THE Fin' F kinda shit is THAT? I'd never watched Fox news before, & I saw all that they were in the way they tried to denigrate him the day he DIED. Jesus.
5353 2018-08-30 14:51:04 disobey instruction for stand-by because of inspection or whatnot, but no captain will do that. As for Libyan SAR, most companies avidly avoid those waters under all circumstances. So you see only supply ships for oil rigs operating there.

5359 2018-08-30 14:50:14 Question for @Maersk What is critical is what will happen if the fuel oil is accidentally spilt – will it emulsify or will it evaporate? #Arctic #shipping

5361 2018-08-30 14:49:45 Actually socialism didn’t destroy Venezuela, oil dependency and lack of economic diversification destroyed The Venezuelan economy. It’s had nothing to do with socialism. If it was a major capitalistic economy the same thing would have happend.

5383 2018-08-30 14:46:44 I will contain my pipeline rant. But none of this is fought on actual fact. Science and fact are clear on this. Pipelines are ridiculously safe. The fight is about oil sands, let the market decide that.
5384 2018-08-30 14:46:40 no smarts there. CCleaners security track record is awful. Registry cleaners are generally considered snake oil and/or badware.
I certainly which @chocolateynuget would be more restrictive about what goes into the (community) repository.
5385 2018-08-30 14:46:35 If the sanctions are not properly implemented and exempted, then the Iranian regime will certainly achieve a nuclear weapon, and the world will witness a terrible nuclear terrorism. Oil and banking sanctions must be fully implemented

5390 2018-08-30 14:45:59 I’ve never taken a car to the dealership for an oil change before. They are also going to wash the car and check the alignment for free. I feel like the crown prince of Honda.
5391 2018-08-30 14:45:54 I can’t find any oils for my pen in Tampa this city so trash and I’m waiting on my sister girl with the delivery but I no longer can feel my brain I need the oil 
5392 2018-08-30 14:45:46 Blend 4 1/2 tbsps barley with 9 tsps bluefish. Mix into  Olive Oil. Mix until crumbly. Serve over basmati rice.
5393 2018-08-30 14:45:32 Not at all. It is the ability to spot the irrationality that makes you money. The market IS behaving irrationally right now. If this was ANY other commodity prices would already be rising dramatically...think taking shutting down ALL Saudi Oil production indefinitely.
5394 2018-08-30 14:45:31 I am not anti-pipeline.  I believe it is safer to transport oil by pipeline than by train and trucks.  I am anti-Kinder Morgan Pipeline.  We have been in hell trying to deal with them.  I wonder what happens now...

5412 2018-08-30 14:43:47 @elonmusk Just curious. How come there isn't more research into desalinization plants? We have massive droughts in Australia, Africa etc. Seems like if we are able to pump oil/natural gas thousands of miles that we should be able to do that with water. Just thought I'd ask.

5431 2018-08-30 14:42:04 In 1939-40 the USSR was selling Germany grain, oil, strategic minerals and receiving in exchange the blue prints for some of the Nazis' most sophisticated weapons. Funny way to prepare for a total and existential war.

5451 2018-08-30 14:39:50 The biggest barriers are politics and how much energy companies will pay for clean energy. 

Currently, solar electricity is the only one that generates a net profit because energy companies will only pay $0.22/kWh. It doesn't help that politicians favor coal and oil.

5487 2018-08-30 14:36:23 @ChubbyFoodTruck oil changed and ready for belvidere street today?
5488 2018-08-30 14:36:15 i was  checking the oil in my car (daddy taught). a man came over and said I'm not trying to hit on you but do you need some help. I appreciate chivalry, I kindly declined, but I also felt bad cuz this guy felt he had to say that to protect himself just to be a nice guy.
5489 2018-08-30 14:36:14 Please allow them be. They will end up the proverbial soon-to-roast one wallowing in oil and dancing near a glowing fire. A reversed xenophobia will put them where they rightly belong soon: the dustbin of history. #TeamTSTV

5493 2018-08-30 14:35:34 #MyKia story for my #KiaSoul.  Had to get my catalytic converter replaced twice with under 60K miles.  Told that my aif filter was dirty and caused the problem both times, even though I get it checked with each oil change and the "check engine" light was NOT on either time.
5494 2018-08-30 14:35:34 In the day trade, the rupee plunged to a record low of 70.90 to the dollar as firming oil prices fanned fears of widening current account deficit. #RupeeAt70 #rupee #rupee #rupeeatalltimelow #currency #currencyconverter #tourism
5495 2018-08-30 14:35:33 I have Naturya Organic Hemp Protein Powder, but I also get that everyone has a different taste so you may not like it. For example I can't stomach anything with coconut oil or stevia or coriander or dark chocolate

5497 2018-08-30 14:35:16 I just took two hits of my blue dream oil and I’m in another simulation.

5512 2018-08-30 14:33:37 @jiffylube is canceled $48 for an oil change is highway robbery
5513 2018-08-30 14:33:32 U might poop your pants... if u put a teaspoon of butter and a teaspoon of coconut oil in your coffee its now super extreme coffee
5514 2018-08-30 14:33:26 Aliens are part of that suppression.  How are they getting here?  They certainly aren't using gas, coal, or oil.

5517 2018-08-30 14:32:59 Thanks boo! I usually do a ACV & Indian Clay mask once a week. Ima try the turmeric, sub coconut oil for tea tree oil and use clay instead of flour.
5518 2018-08-30 14:32:38 no. like roaring 20's happy. like it will never crash happy. like the great depression is not possible. like i will not be eating from a tin can by an oil drum fire in 4 years happy.

5521 2018-08-30 14:32:28 In all fairness it will have to be pretty incredible news to get us anywhere near .88 days. Imo a lot of pi’s have lost faith and any raises they are bailing out
5522 2018-08-30 14:32:27 @CarBombBoom13 I'm a hockey mom of 2 boys in the burbs. 1 has already had a concussion. I believe there needs to be more research for TBI & CTE. I'm working w/Kannaway & hope that their research on CBD oil & the brain can help us all. Is this something you want to be involved in?
5523 2018-08-30 14:32:22 Imagine if our oil was sold at world prices and Irving Oil could access Alberta oil!!!!  We would be a much stronger country.

5525 2018-08-30 14:32:17 Wall Street can't short Bitcoin, Ethereum, Gold, Oil, USD all at the same time. The Dollar can rally. Gold can Rally. Bitcoin can Rally. The west is losing the ability to price gold to Shanghai. The East is losing ability to price Oil to USA. Fed will lose control of DXY price.
5526 2018-08-30 14:31:47 @viocoilchange just had an oil change in Mt Kisco, NY. They said my service information and details are shared with other companies. Really? Do your customers know this? Do you have permission to do this? I certainly didn’t give you permission. #PrivacyControl #poorservice #fail

5528 2018-08-30 14:31:30 I live in oil country , 51 parallel. Energy firms were stacked with conservatives, executive and middle management. Demographics are changing and the younger generation doesn't hide their liberal political leanings any more.
5529 2018-08-30 14:31:15 erroneous. being thin is not unhealthy. being anorexic or bulimic is unhealthy. those things are not synonymous.
in contrast, being overweight is ALWAYS unhealthy.
5530 2018-08-30 14:31:15 Coconut oil contains MCTs. Those go straight into your gut and are oxidized (used) pretty much immediately.
5531 2018-08-30 14:31:02 Whatever the decision on Trans Mountain remember asking an oil man whether you need to build it is like asking a Realtor should you buy a house. Never ask anyone for their opinion if the negative of the answer will affect their income. #TransMountain @CBCEyeopener
5532 2018-08-30 14:30:45 If u do a quick google search the internet says oil diffusers. This boujee lady I work with uses young living v expensive but she like glows

5537 2018-08-30 14:30:17 The government of Angola  is ready to sell SA cheap crude oil . The problem is failure by our government to build refineries that suits Angolan crude oil. Directionless Leadership
5538 2018-08-30 14:30:15 The original snake oil was Bank Nationalisation that was sold by your party 50 years back. It is also the biggest scam in the history of world. Just reminding you..
5539 2018-08-30 14:30:14 I tweaked mine a bit and used: Tumeric, 3-4 freshly squeezed lemons, coconut oil and flour. I make a small batch that I use for about 1.5 weeks then remake.
5540 2018-08-30 14:30:08 Bitch about working GY. Husband diffused peppermint oil  in our room... which wouldn’t be so bad IF he hadn’t had garlic fries last night at dinner  our room smells awful and I can’t get it aired out.

5543 2018-08-30 14:29:52 Las normas de la OIL dicen que las traducciones juradas deben acompañarse del original sellado y fechado en cada página (el original no debe firmarse). Así lo hacemos nosotros y suponemos que la traductora lo habrá hecho igual.

5545 2018-08-30 14:29:37 Projects needed & ramping.  Production at highs oil & gas.  Cos “mostly” self funding.  Coverage high for most.  Yields still very attractive.  If not now, when....
5546 2018-08-30 14:29:29 Brilliant !! That is what we want to hear..
5547 2018-08-30 14:29:17 Like let’s be very clear: oil is immensely useful. It’s worked it’s way into being a keystone of our economy and infrastructure. However, we are at a point where we know it is not sustainable and that we need to explore other options.
5548 2018-08-30 14:28:56 Geologist finds massive Alaskan oil well on a hunch
5549 2018-08-30 14:28:44 So I started bathing with this pomegranate dove soap and going over it with this coconut body scrub it’s great. With the dove I feel so clean and fresh but the scrub removes everything left over leaving my skin polished, and the coconut oil acts as a moisturizer.
5550 2018-08-30 14:28:43 look like swampys in their dungarees??

5567 2018-08-30 14:26:49 If athletes can change allegiance easily to the highest bidder, then the Olympics and international sports will become a farce, the richest (oil,gas) countries will just "buy" all the talent and end up taking the gold medals.
5568 2018-08-30 14:26:49 The special session is over Mississippi has a lottery and the BP Oil money has been split up.

5570 2018-08-30 14:26:35 so now Jason you dont believe what the oil companies are telling you? are you going to open a new alberta oil company and call it petrocon?
5571 2018-08-30 14:26:28 i better order some more then
5572 2018-08-30 14:26:25 The Petro is a scam and should be seen as such. But I believe the orinoco basin oil is the fracked kind so that the infrastructure is different from the standard rigging seen here. Also isn’t the concept less based on existing barrels than extractable ones?
5573 2018-08-30 14:26:23 The carnival barker has spoken.  Plenty of snake oil will be sold. And you don’t want to miss the elephant taking a huge dump in our living rooms. Set your TiVo now because we all know Trump loves our vets like he loves John McCain!
5574 2018-08-30 14:26:15 His destruction of the oil industry is another.  Failure on NAFTA.  Allowing that bitter and dour Freeland to negotiate anything is pure folly.

5588 2018-08-30 14:24:22 Couldn’t agree with you more. I foolishly believed that North American society in general was beyond the simplistic concept of ‘buying votes’ with dreams & snake oil. Guys like Ford & Trump are so fake it boggles the mind how a person can be duped by their lies.
5589 2018-08-30 14:24:17 Considering we are exporting more than importing, we should stop importing and use our own oil/gas which could drive costs of gas below $2 per gallon. Some might say this is impossible but it is very possible and likely to happen if we continue to put American's first.

5621 2018-08-30 14:21:11 He grew hemp; but if you look at the original 28 doctors interviewed by the government to ask about the safety of cannabis oil : 27 recommended it and prescribed it regularly. There was only one doctor who said it was harmful! Not exactly scientific reason!
5622 2018-08-30 14:21:07 @FaithMaina__ @PierraM  My Aunt bought cooking oil in Nairobi on arrival shagz only to realise that it was water #beatboxlive
5623 2018-08-30 14:21:04 Our M.L.A. for Prince George is anti-pipeline.
Previous governments: conservative and liberal cut fire fighting budgets. They advocate for big oil and stomp on clean air rights of British Columbians. Conservatives and Liberals act like climate change deniers. I don't blame N.D.P.

5628 2018-08-30 14:20:21 Let them put tariffs on. We stop sending them oil and water. In 2 years they'll all be dead or horribly mutated because of their polluted water.Then we can all have our own real live Mad Max movie.

5633 2018-08-30 14:19:58 Sir if IT collections have incr by over 60%, could you give us little respite by reducing tax on petrol & diesel! Everytime we ask 4 it, some spokesperson says on TV, that money is reqd for growth. Whether oil purchase price incr/decr, govt share remains constant! Thats not fair!
5634 2018-08-30 14:19:57 ありがとう！にしにしもおめでとう！
5635 2018-08-30 14:19:56 All of the above.  Depending on the week it may be because of events at the convention center or Lucas Oil.  I come up West Street from the Southside.  It is just crazy to think traffic in that one little area near Lucas Oil and Victory Field can impact such a small commute.
5636 2018-08-30 14:19:52 #oott  can oil demand hold up with EM crisis getting deeper ?
5637 2018-08-30 14:19:47 How you would love to see Maduro fall!Venezuelans, look at  Libya and Gaddaffi. They don’t care about you. They want your oil.

5639 2018-08-30 14:19:43 getting my oil changed and a guy pumping gas looked over at me so I was like "oh hey man, swapping fluids is more fun with company" and he got in his car and left

5641 2018-08-30 14:19:24 Well if it wasn’t the kratom it surely must have been the cannabidiol oil drops... these professionals are doing irreparable damage blaming plants over poison.

5648 2018-08-30 14:18:45 Rupee’s plight 
 
  Trade deficit- mostly because of India's unrelenting demand for oil- is a  major reason behind rupee's fall. A widening trade deficit is dragging  the rupee down as more imports require India to buy more foreign  currencies.
5649 2018-08-30 14:18:38 #crude Oil prices up after a U.S. government report showed that domestic crude supplies fell more than expected last week brent @77,49
5650 2018-08-30 14:18:38 It's such a safe job, too. My other uncle was legit (I don't think he works there anymore) making something like 240K a year working there, too...with NO DEGREE and health care covered, etc. Just as a technician. Thank goodness I have choices here. It's not "oil job or nothing".
5651 2018-08-30 14:18:37 Rupee’s plight 
The rupee has been on a  record-setting spree in terms of its fall. It touched its fresh record  low of 70.86 against the US dollar today. Higher crude oil prices and  sustained demand for the US dollar has been adding to rupee's fall.

5655 2018-08-30 14:17:57 Just pull up at a oil change place/tire place  and they will do it. That way u can keep it moving playa 
5656 2018-08-30 14:17:53 Who moved my Sensex

 Global brokerage firm Jefferies retained  underperform  rating on the oil-to-telecom behemoth. It expects RIL’s  refining  margins to ease from highs of the 2017-18 financial year as  refining  demand supply becomes less benign.

5664 2018-08-30 14:17:26 An overhang of homeless crude in the Atlantic Basin has halved in recent weeks, suggesting oil traders are bracing for a further supply loss from Iran due to U.S. sanctions and a new rally in prices.
5665 2018-08-30 14:17:24 The sheer quantity of snake oil salesman in Christian churches organizationally would seem to indicate that your point falls short of adequately recognizing the problem.
5666 2018-08-30 14:17:18 Use any hair oil like olive oil or coconut oil on damp hair. Applying oil or product on damp hair absorbs better.
5667 2018-08-30 14:17:17 and the present Governor won't even say the words climate change and thinks we should have oil rigs off our beaches, drain our springs and pollute our water. VOTE @AndrewGillum

5686 2018-08-30 14:15:31 Quote from contact inside crude oil supply chains:

"We know iraq has a lot of oil but even oil in surplus everywhere and oversupplied indefinitely"

5716 2018-08-30 14:12:01 Hmm - I think acne recording would be great! Hydration and oil tend to fluctuate a lot, so I think they'd be hard to track. One of the issues is that comedogenicity still depends a lot on the individual e.g. coconut oil is polarising - it's a little like allergies in that sense.

5743 2018-08-30 14:09:12 Domestic stock markets ended lower today, Profit-booking by funds and retail investors owing to August month derivatives expiry and weak global cues dampened investor sentiment. Weak Rupee and rising crude oil prices also fuelled the downtrend.

5761 2018-08-30 14:07:05 A major “threat group” to watch out for are the “Snake oil vendors”. Those that take advantage of orgs with not-so-matured processes/frameworks; selling them every shiny little box with no direct cost benefit realization for the org.
5762 2018-08-30 14:07:04 "Monkey up the election"???

5775 2018-08-30 14:05:30 You tell them jimma. The Donald should do it like you. Have Americans held hostage around the world, no oil, no gas, gas lines, no jobs, no money. Just a peanut farmer from GA at the wheel.

5777 2018-08-30 14:05:24 Lining up education would require the state to actually care about our educational system. I have not seen a lot of that recently. How can OK support big oil without qualified workers?
5778 2018-08-30 14:05:15 Like I said Russians always attempt interference. True. It alleges page met with an oil oligarch. Whom he never met. False. Cohen had a meeting in Prague. Content? True. Dnc server was hacked by Russia. False. So what’s true proves nothing.

5784 2018-08-30 14:04:42 You are both ignoring the role of a one-horse economy. Venezuela only produces oil when the price per barrel falls through the floor and you did budget projects at 150 per barrel. (they actually did that) you are going to get a ballooning debt it's impossible to pay back.

5835 2018-08-30 13:59:47 These knives are a high carbon steel. After using them they need to be washed off and treated with light, food safe oil. It will naturally patina over time regardless. The oil will prevent rusting and preserve the blade. Treated diligently, lasts forever!

5925 2018-08-30 13:50:16 Hemp oil can shrink cancer cells but my mum in anal U.K. won't get that treatment and may die. Look how many folk industrial pharma has killed with phentenol over prescription. It isn't fair. I hope she doesn't die before I can say goodbye and hug her and hold her.xox

HELLLLO!
5940 2018-08-30 13:48:28 M8 prices go up it’s called inflation and the fact that the rivers don’t flow with oil might help it’s not like one party is advocating for the destruction of oil world wide...

5952 2018-08-30 13:47:30 It’s extremely upsetting to see my patients be told by organizations, such as the TTC, that they cannot use cannabis oil at work for pain and must go back on opiates.

5957 2018-08-30 13:47:11 Going into the Labor Day weekend, the national average stands at $2.84/gal, just a penny higher than the summer low. It may rise over the weekend as oil closes in on $70 once again, but expect some relief (10-25c/gal) in the months ahead.

5959 2018-08-30 13:46:46 The last time the oil price dropped, it immediately affected everything.

5985 2018-08-30 13:44:56 weak opinion. Energy exports are key for Russian economy. With current rising prices on oil (from 45 to current 70 and up), and respective gas, it makes budgeting and development an easier task.

5994 2018-08-30 13:43:39 oil's latest run-up is probably running out of steam but hard to be bearish today if it can't even get below the VAH (~69.57)

6003 2018-08-30 13:42:48 Remember the EU lifted sanctions on oil exports after the terrorists took control of the oil fields
6004 2018-08-30 13:42:45 By country; China. By industry; big oil tops every list I could find in a quick search, by a decent margin. And another list mentioned a huge polluter that most people don't think of as such; the US military. Pretty sure I'm picking up what you're putting down Adam.
6005 2018-08-30 13:42:43 Were JD Rockefeller still with us, given what Amazon and these people are getting away with, he would reconstitute Standard Oil and tell government..."make my day punks"
6006 2018-08-30 13:42:41 Good. At least the regulators are pointing this out. Producers in North America cannot continue to increase oil production while at the same time wasting gas production like this. This is how we do things in Iraq and it's wrong.

6009 2018-08-30 13:42:22 4 - Canada needs environmental policies that manage ambitious climate leadership while recognizing the role of oil and gas production in our economy. It’s a unique challenge, but a transition to renewable energy is possible, and all provinces can win economically. END

6020 2018-08-30 13:40:36 It was over 0.3 in Q2, with some expectations of it rising through 2019, but because of the regulatory piece and basin oil price differentials, I'd be hard pressed to make my own guess what flaring would look like next year. A lot of moving parts.

6031 2018-08-30 13:39:33 Trade and regulatory risks remain pretty high for businesses of all sizes. Though pre-2015 oil boom is a pretty high bar for comparison
6032 2018-08-30 13:39:32 It was just a DUI and burglary. Which sounded more like criminal mischief. 

However, open borders while you restrict gun ownership, strangling Texas's oil economy are far worse.

6040 2018-08-30 13:38:50 This is the truth-I've seen it with my own eyes. Last time I was in MN I was shocked and frankly offended by the loud, obnoxious, rude, uncivilized, nasty behavior I encountered while shopping in a Walmart.
As far as integrating, that's exactly like mixing oil & water.
6041 2018-08-30 13:38:34 Car manufacturers, energy producers, oil refinery, train manufacturers, pharmaceuticals have all lost jobs to EU over the last 40yrs. So until we have a gov who stand up for British jobs and companies this trend will continue whether we are in or out of EU.

His name will be synonymous with corruption, cruelty. He fears exposure more than death; he is a coward among cowards.

6129 2018-08-30 13:27:19 GERS suggests Scottish oil is worth a half eaten sandwich yet with less oil Norway makes 20b this year.

6170 2018-08-30 13:23:45 I cannot believe that Americans are letting the 5th Wave get a stronger foothold. Do people not see what's going on in the rest of the world. Venezuela is top on the list. And oil producing Nation where people are starving figure that one out. Socialism bad

6211 2018-08-30 13:18:33 It's a joke. Like the conspiracy theory about the US pressuring KSA over the oil price, resulting in the drop, which both Russia & Vzla have pushed. And they miss how Vzla is bullying Guyana over the oil & gas about to be developed in territory Vzla claims is theirs.

6229 2018-08-30 13:16:35 The oil company has externalized costs and risks on taxpayers investors and communities. If people moved beyond environmental to economic conservation, the issue has far more traction. Same issue, just framed in dollars.

6232 2018-08-30 13:16:27 Fake news media. Get it right. How does he kiss Putin’s ass? By encouraging our allies to not get their oil in Russia? By killing 200 of their mercenaries, which Trump did. Or by asking Putin for more time because he will have better leverage after the election?  Which Obama did.

6247 2018-08-30 13:14:46 Red, you need to have a two-by-four that for years lay in a deep pool of oil before someone found it and dried it out. Then some nails were driven deeply in one end to give it added weight. It comes in handy in moments like this.
6248 2018-08-30 13:14:44 Kaktovik's located inside ANWR. I wonder if the opening of the wildlife refuge to oil development has anything to do with it. COINCIDENCE?

6253 2018-08-30 13:14:07 I used coconut oil on my little one.  Just massaged it in to the scalp and then left it to soak in, then used a soft babh brush to brush away the scales.  Took about a week but it cleared it right up.

6337 2018-08-30 13:04:30 oil is typically a blend of vegetable oils including soybean, corn, canola, safflower & sunflower. Hope this helps!
6338 2018-08-30 13:04:29 Thank you for your patience Melany! The rinds themselves have not added oils as they tend to have plenty of fat. When flavor is applied, they receive an oil mist to help the flavors to adhere that

6351 2018-08-30 13:04:05 This is what all of it is about - corruption through taking money from the public purse and distributing it amongst your school chums to hide in the Caribbean tax havens.

At least when the North Sea oil was flowing the extraction didn't do much harm to the economy as a whole...
6352 2018-08-30 13:04:05 Anyone remember how Nixon's economists invented the Petro-Dollar and had Saudi Arabia agree to only sell oil in US dollars to ease our transition off the gold standard?

6357 2018-08-30 13:03:13 Seems to me that to build an industrial railway the planners look for pristine land with a small population that won't put up much resistance.

6365 2018-08-30 13:02:37 I like the little throw away blurb about nearby oil wells. Keep the narrative going, eh CBC?
6366 2018-08-30 13:02:25 The headline and lead is incorrect. Oil Marketing Companies collectively will be setting up 52,000 retail outlets as well as LPG distributorships.

6432 2018-08-30 12:55:17 Nigeria's leaders don't really want to grow Nigeria's economy. They want to control it and demand rents, that's all.

They also haven't brought their minds out of the 1970s - they can't conceive of a Nigeria that's different from oil boom era Nigeria.
6433 2018-08-30 12:55:11 But refinery technology gets better and better so they can use every last drop of oil and produce less waste.

6444 2018-08-30 12:53:50 The oil price is high because of the slew of taxes that the government has put on the commodity - Partly because there are very few revenue sources left - these are intricacies of the economy which one must understand before making any political judgments.

6452 2018-08-30 12:53:15 I wonder..

If geologist study earth science so they can exploit the earth for oil.
So, an arborist study arboriculture so they can exploit the tree to know which one is best for logging?

How about saving the Planet or saving the Trees?

All those knowledge just for profit?

6455 2018-08-30 12:52:52 Fine with me. But when one reads articles that large cap mutual funds like AmCent, TRowePrice etc. have consistently outperformed hedge funds (and not for 1 year) but many- it makes the individual investor wonder that it's snake oil they're selling. Returns speak for themselves.

6508 2018-08-30 12:47:29 Oil palm in Nigeria. West Africa used to be the centre of the palm oil industry. The export of palm kernels began in 1832 and by 1911 “British” West Africa alone exported 157,000 tonnes of which about 75 percent came from Nigeria.
6509 2018-08-30 12:47:24 Those people are leaving their country because of the economic sanctions the US and Europe are applying to it.

Those bastards don't care about democracy, they want to take control of the oil, as they do in Saudi Arabia, you big knee-head.
6510 2018-08-30 12:47:19 Take OPEC as a classical example of manipulation of natural resource which is oil. They simple slows down production to rock up oil prices.
6511 2018-08-30 12:47:10 Palm Oil is from West Africa taken by the British to Asia and the Indonesians and Malaysians then mass produced it to their detriment. At least understand what youre talking about. Please research your commentary. Facts not opinion.

6536 2018-08-30 12:43:18 True that every human activity that now depends on fossil fuels have carbon footprint. You're looking at how are things manufactured, maintained and extracted today, not how can they be in a fossil fuel free society. Coal mining and oil spills also cause animal and habitat loss.

6541 2018-08-30 12:42:35 Two things, possibly related. Venezuela has the biggest oil/gas reserves in the world. The US has strangled Venezuela with sanctions.

6582 2018-08-30 12:38:38 #Mabuza Fuel prices continue to be a concern for government. Between July 2017 and July 2018, the fuel price has increased by 25.2%, leading in part to a 10% in the cost of transport. Fuel prices have been driven by a higher global oil price and a weak rand. #MabuzaQandA

6592 2018-08-30 12:37:17 Probably because he's ashamed he fell for the snake oil salesman's lies. Didn't know that his music would be used by a divider in chief

6658 2018-08-30 12:28:54 The price of Oil as also based on Supply and demand. Cut the Gas Tax and eliminate the ethenol that California has mandated exclusively for sale in our state. That alone should lower our gas prices to that of neighboring States. Maybe $1.50 per gallon less.
6659 2018-08-30 12:28:41 I accept you've a choice but for me NOT killing another sentient being takes precedence, always. PS. Palm oil is replete with many consequential issues -- e.g. habitat loss -- and I woudl avoid it at all cost.

6677 2018-08-30 12:26:34 Engines can be designed to be very clean, it’s the fuel you put in them and the exhaust that comes out that’s the problem. Also shipping mostly uses fuel oil which is a waste product of refining other fuels. From 2020 big regulation changes coming for fuel.

6724 2018-08-30 12:21:43 Yep. Colorado oil & gas industry is only concerned about jobs and the economy when it can use them as a punch line. They don't give two sh*ts about those jobs when they cut them in waves because they overdrilled enough to crash oil and gas prices.

6754 2018-08-30 12:18:33 Oil companies, remarkably enough, sell their product, which is a way of deciding whether Chapo house gets to have heat in the winter time. A good place to start with who decides about power is, oh, the emails sent by Enron fucks during the great Cali brownout of 2000.

6763 2018-08-30 12:17:26 If you have to constantly change parts on a machine you’ve got to question whether it’s running smoothly! More oil required to reduce the friction that’s wearing out the parts
6764 2018-08-30 12:17:01 Did you know? Argan oil can actually decrease sebum production! This is why it's great for oily skin, but shouldn't be used daily on your scalp when you are a "dry" hair type to begin with. #FactOfTheDay #learn #haircare

6798 2018-08-30 12:12:33 The higher oil goes the more value becomes extreme in conventional international micro-cap oil producers w exposure to Brent pricing.

6842 2018-08-30 12:06:32 All society needs resources to burn through. Doesn't matter if you're socialist, capitalist, or communist, and all of these systems will appear to fail the minute a resource runs dry. Just look at Venezuela. When oil became less profitable, their socialist system failed hard.

6850 2018-08-30 12:05:20 I'll say that your hope is extremly optimistic. What I think is far more likely is that they'll be narrowly-focused on getting their % of barrels from Kirkuk and currently-producing oil keeps flowing, arbitral suit notwithstanding.

6858 2018-08-30 12:04:03 Since the misguided decontrol of oil prices, it is not only the globally traded price of fuel but also the exchange rate that determines domestic oil prices . Govt should concentrate on correcting the economic fundamentals rather  indulge in soap operas in a run up to election.

6889 2018-08-30 11:59:34 Not at all, it's very strange decision considering very high prices on oil right now (russian budget have profit by end of 2018) - at the same time he seized from several millions people (at least 2) their money and forced them to search job in crisis falling russian economy.

6899 2018-08-30 11:58:16 X oil, I wouldn’t buy now. C/A matters at the moment; trade deficit widened further in July (weak exports). INR is correlated to price action of high yielders ZAR/BRL/RUB (not good). INR undervalued but respect price action and ST headwind. Also risk of outflows if NIFTY drops

6929 2018-08-30 11:54:28 Germany is doing it; maybe they're a better example. It will happen because oil is finite. Read the Forbes article I posted at the start of this thread. Oil for transportation uses will continue in use longer because renewables are not yet capable of much mobil energy.

6974 2018-08-30 11:48:05 When you accept that oil is finite, it's use is growing, and it's price is subject to geopolitical shocks, you'll realize that, at some point, it will become unaffordable for most.

6978 2018-08-30 11:47:40 It just took me three hours to read one script. I blame Blake Carrington for distracting me by wittering on in the background about how he is going to destroy evil ex-wife Alexis and take over her oil empire

7011 2018-08-30 11:41:57 According to AAA the price of gasoline will drop by an average of 14 cents per gallon to $2.70 this fall - Steady oil prices & the end of summer demand will drive the prices down - Also, refineries are expected to switch to winter-blend gasolines, which are cheaper to produce

7024 2018-08-30 11:40:15 Business taxes is 30% in Nigeria, so 30% of the profit made from oil goes to Nigeria anyways. Most of the money stays in Nigeria after all the taxes are added together. So no, you are wrong, Nigeria gets MOST of the oil money.

7059 2018-08-30 11:33:25 I should include that their entire economy was based off of oil, so when the price of oil went down massively their society collapsed, leading to the Venezuela you see today. This paired with the economic sanctions by the US have made Venezuela a horrible place to live.

7115 2018-08-30 11:22:09 @AndurandPierre was right indeed. Over the last six months China oil imports have shown ~twice more volatility than usual (last time they had same vol was in first half 2015 which ended up with massive CNY devalualtion similar to this time).
7116 2018-08-30 11:22:07 I love food too, hence why I can reel out the names. I don't agree with the best àádùn from òṣogbo o, yes I'm biased. Our àádùn is moist and tasty, the others I have tasted were usually dry. Evidence of having eaten àádùn is the oil stain on your khaki pocket

7257 2018-08-30 11:00:15 Crude may soon be largely primarily be used as feedstock for plastics, as LNG & renewables make oil a filthy luxury. Thus SA is scrambling to get a foothold in tech & other sectors. Too late: If if you’ve made trillions doing nothing at all, you cant invent a new economy.

7260 2018-08-30 10:59:38 .It begins. US will  need strict Northern Borders. Canada is really just a land grab by UK Royals & UK cannot maintain against Islam invaders. In the 1980's European Nations agreed w Saudi Arabia to allow massive Islamic Migration, Sharia, Mosques, in exchange for Cheap Oil.
7261 2018-08-30 10:59:25 How much are @theSNP pathetic climate proposals influenced by thinking after Brexit they'll get independence and lots of lovely years of oil & gas revenues? We could be so much better than this.

7265 2018-08-30 10:58:23 Oil prices climbed Wednesday to highest finish in August,after a U.S. EIA reported domestic crude supplies fell by 2.6M barrels,which was more than expected last week.
7266 2018-08-30 10:57:49 CWG certainly have got a nerve. Why not bend all London's railways to pass through Canary Wharf? Support the economies of the Gulf after oil.

7307 2018-08-30 10:50:37 Notice they have already started making it about racism so they dont have to address the political issues.  It will be smear campaigns that dont come near the issues for the midterms. I am not buying the snake oil they are selling.
7308 2018-08-30 10:50:29 Maybe a mixture of witchazel with alcohol, lavender oil and tea tree oil might help. Witchazel and tea tree products can be bought in boots too. I found getting the pure stuff and just mixing it myself was more effective. You look great regardless

7329 2018-08-30 10:47:32 You are right, the trade imbalance
is an issue. It has to do with the trend of prices: oil, gas and 
agricultural products are the main exports from Africa to Germany/EU. The prices of those products dropped in the past years. This is why the trade balance has become negative.
7330 2018-08-30 10:47:28 It’s ok with the right to bailout banks and Wall Street and farmers. Pass out subsidies to oil Co. Corp Jets. But god forbid we have healthcare for us the people aka the tax payers
7331 2018-08-30 10:47:26 During the oil embargo of the early ‘70’s, there were many ways to conserve, and one of them was to let your pets sleep w/ you to keep you warm in the winters. I had a cool cat that Loved to sleep on top of my head. Still miss ya, Pooh Bear.

Because Philip was onto your silly snake oil charade.

7529 2018-08-30 10:17:40 Discussing this in the office I have decided I'd like to use oil paints properly.

7535 2018-08-30 10:16:33 1. For those below poverty line, an LPG connection worth Rs 1400, would given at a cost of Rs 200. 
2. For those above poverty line connection wld be given on payment of Rs 1200 instead of Rs 1400. 
All oil companies have been given directions to give immediate connections (2/2)

7540 2018-08-30 10:15:52 Do you mean "barking up the wrong tree"?  Anyway, are there DTI offices in municipalities? Not in our municipality. DOST has a video on making bangus in oil. Are there DOST offices in municipalities? Not in our municipality. Anything about food should be under the DA's office.

7542 2018-08-30 10:15:33 Jas, remember we often discussed in TEA the possibilities of insurgency across the Oil Belt Lokichar to Lamu-deep-see?

There is great need to modulate this low-grade,  headless insurgency to avoid indemnifying it.  Every soldier that deploys in Boni is acutely aware of this.
7543 2018-08-30 10:15:19 Some of our leaders dont know this oil business is very oily, until they get soaked.

They've outspent Arsenal in the last 4 years while winning less trophies than us or is it an issue of an owner willing to invest more in his club?

7554 2018-08-30 10:13:30 I do not know where you get this "rigged" idea. Oil is all based on the law of supply and demand. Plus there is very little spare capacity so it is not like producers are not "producing" enough.

7576 2018-08-30 10:09:30 Don’t be afraid to splash a wee bit of water in there too if it seems too dry & hot. I use just the tiniest bit of oil. It’s almost like a fried/poached hybrid.

7579 2018-08-30 10:09:20 In the middle of the oil price crash, #CHAR directors halved their salaries and opted to be remunerated in shares so, they have plenty of skin in the game. The Total Board and Senior Management holdings equate to 8.2% of the company.

7597 2018-08-30 10:06:01 Hi Stephen, We only use RSPO certified sources of palm oil and only when it’s not possible to replace with other fats. Our food team is working to reduce our use of palm oil. We hope this helps to reassure you.

7601 2018-08-30 10:04:52 The nt makes clear that he was an ordinary man. At many instances people asked him directly if he was a god and instead of saying "YES" he hedges and gives them some silly parable - a hallmark of snake oil.

7603 2018-08-30 10:04:12 People all over the world may ask why Iranians are not able to Change their regime?

7604 2018-08-30 10:04:02 @wkyc the experiment has failed. Will and Tiffany are like water and oil. Not sure the thought process on pairing them up but it does not work  The intern of a producer needs to be replaced. And that weather commercial is the worst.
7605 2018-08-30 10:04:02 I've had good luck with a few drops of tea tree oil in coconut oil. It dries out your skin just a little (reducing the itchiness), and it's also antimicrobial (in case you can't help scratching the itchy lil bites). Topical antihistamine cream might help lots, too.

7635 2018-08-30 09:59:10 One tablespoon of butter contains 7 grams of saturated fat; 1 tablespoon coconut oil equals 14 grams; 1 tablespoon olive oil contains 1.9 grams; and 1 tablespoon canola oil gives you 1.1 grams saturated fat.

Is coconut oil poison? Of course not; nor is it heart healthy.
7636 2018-08-30 09:59:05 GEJ responding to Saraki's #FuelSubsidy concerns: "Senator Saraki. You know this oil business. Very oily."

To be sure, that was then and GEJ hardly hid his views about the ownership of all Nigeria's oil income, but listening to this, I hardly knew whether to laugh or cry.
7637 2018-08-30 09:58:55 Kageni found and is exploiting our warped thinking of risk, profit and irrational attachment to land. He is brilliant because he found a niche, but that makes him a snakes oil salesman exploiting our ignorance for super gains.
7638 2018-08-30 09:58:47 Nope, because there is one big difference. 
Alcohol is *stored* future energy (just like oil).
Bitcoin is *proof of used* energy.

7645 2018-08-30 09:56:05 10-20mg of CBD you mean, right? Because 10-20mg or oil does not touch on the cannabinoid amount, and considering every product or 'oil' has a different amount of cannabinoids inside then to say 10-20mg of oil is misleading
7646 2018-08-30 09:55:40 Happened in practice at 1962 German GP at Nurburgring. Camera came off de Beaufort’s Porsche, ripped sump off G Hill’s BRM which crashed into trees. Mags’ Cooper then spun on the oil into the trees..... Could have been much worse. Hill then won the race.....
7647 2018-08-30 09:55:30 #UKOG Like DL said, what's of great interest is SS's statement "UKOG, supported by its remaining three coventurers, can now steer the way towards permanent HH oil production in 2019" Now if that is not a tell tale sign Portland and/or Kimm will be commercial, what is ?

7666 2018-08-30 09:53:11 I'm interested. If a foreign military power were to impose an embargo on Australia restricting oil imports into Australia perhaps or blocking Australian exports - would we consider that bullying? Or unfair? Should we make laws against that in Australia?

7669 2018-08-30 09:52:38 Oil that china is giving to nk might be from that man-made island china built in a disputed sea region known for rich oil deposits.

7935 2018-08-30 09:02:00 Unless the government come up with a much better plan then independence will not happen!! They based there whole plan on oil! Now, as a british seafarer, i can tell you that they had no plan for seafarers tax deduction to continue.. how can we get oil with no seafarers?
7936 2018-08-30 09:01:50 Yes, the USA is busily weaponising medicines and food in its full on attempts to smash Venezuela due to wanting its oil reserves.
Shocking and disgraceful or to put it another way, the normal standard of American behaviour.

Christ loves His creation but he hates sin(iniquity). THE CHURCH TODAY SEEMS TO LOVE INIQUITY INSTEAD OF HATING IT. PROV.8:13
7951 2018-08-30 08:59:39 Hi, we too are concerned by the issues surrounding palm oil sourcing. Nestlé is opposed to deforestation & the destruction of peatlands around the world. It's one of the most serious issues we face and we're committed to tackling it through our responsible sourcing programme.

The answer to the essential question is missing: Why? 

"Excuse me, but I am not convinced."

Until somebody (preferrably the federal government) tells Germans why they should help Turkey, any such action is just going to add oil to the fire.

7955 2018-08-30 08:58:39 @5WrightStuff so energy drinks are the latest demon... how about looking into the influx of toxic rapeseed oil in 90% of our foods - many people are suffering from this hidden evil - from itchy skin to vomiting or severe acid refluxes. In fact it has many health implications :(

7970 2018-08-30 08:55:08 The old growth argument again without the massive contraction we had we wouldnt be seeing this kind of growth. Its a misleading stat that all dippers are clinging to. Compare the economy now to when oil was the same price previously for a fair comparison.

7981 2018-08-30 08:52:50 Contrary to popular belief, Venezuela isn't very socialist James. It's economy rests entirely on it's oil reserves, public ownership sits at around 30%, whereas a centrist country like France has public ownership at 38%. It's also being screwed by the US, who just want the oil.

He had to be born without the seed of a man to be a able to be the perfect sacrifice for the sins of the world.

8139 2018-08-30 08:24:03 Under OBama gasoline prices were under $2/gal.

Why? There is a surplus of oil. It isn't supply and demand. 

Who benefits from high energy prices? Wealthy investors and Putin.

8191 2018-08-30 08:13:29 British nationalists are foaming at the mouth because Yes supporters will donate money via crowd funding, rather than the traditional british approach of soliciting bribes, dark money, or concealing oil wealth.
8192 2018-08-30 08:13:11 In some churches, Pastors buy olive oil for about ¢5 and sell it for probably more.

Some Churches are also into hostels constructing hostels to house their visitors - @eastsportsman [ Head of Current affairs @Citi973/ @CitiTVGH ]
8193 2018-08-30 08:12:59 Also went out and got oil burners, diffusers and lovely scented candles cause I want a delicious smelling good vibes room
8194 2018-08-30 08:12:57 Ban Diwali crackers, ban lighting oil lamps in Indian temples. All smog from the entire world will disappear.  Oh and if you can also ban Holi, climate change will reverse for the good.
8195 2018-08-30 08:12:54 If I’m coming for an oil change stop stop fucking with other shit....
8196 2018-08-30 08:12:33 Oil prices inch up, extending solid gains from the previous session on a fall in U.S. crude inventories and expected disruptions to supply from Iran and Venezuela
8197 2018-08-30 08:12:22 Clearly you didn't read my last tweet and you do not want to accept facts. #Calexit would be bad for the US, and good for #California. Trump could ask ask #Russia for oil seeing as he likes to cozy up with Putin and oil oligarchs. #FuckTrump #TraitorTrump #TrumpRussia
8198 2018-08-30 08:11:41 Do you want to see pictures of me in G strings with oil robbed all over my body while eating Apple. Red apple 
8199 2018-08-30 08:11:38 Interesting elements there. 5% of NG and 6% of oil imports come in via pipelines that I'm sure are protected/backed by the army that the west is going to try and prosecute.

That's a sizeable concern for a China that has been flip-flopping in and out of an energy crisis

8201 2018-08-30 08:11:08 The Norway question is entirely true. The principle of the fund is from their oil industry and the fund doesn’t just magically make money appear, it takes t from workers all over the world.

8207 2018-08-30 08:09:43 @DannyWard2707 hello, my feeling I that olive oil is better than viagra for salad dressings. I’d swap for erectile dysfunction.
8208 2018-08-30 08:09:37 No actually you missed my point. With #California gone thd US would lose billions of dollars from trade, tech industry, and tax revenues. That would far more devestating than loss of oil from the #Mideast. @realDonaldTrump is supporting a terrorist state, #SaudiArabia. #Calexit

8221 2018-08-30 08:07:03 excellent point but may I offer a tiny correction - Truffle Oil is actually very cheap as it contains no truffles (or effectively none).  it is purely synthetic and a blot on the culinary landscape!!

8224 2018-08-30 08:05:57 Anti government enclave? . You mean terrorist filled enclave.  Did you forget al-quada and ISIS chopped people’s heads off and raped and killed women and children? Who do you work for? An Oil company or military industrial complex?
8225 2018-08-30 08:05:52 Nice one bro
8226 2018-08-30 08:05:44 From a Routes article on oil services: ‘"Cost inflation will come back ... The drilling industry working below breakeven is not sustainable." When costs are going up, all things equal, we know that oil prices are going up too!
8227 2018-08-30 08:05:33 ben évidemment !!! mais on voit bien encore une fois que pour ce gouvernement de fracassés,  tout est bon pour taxer/taxer, comme le coup du gaz oil et de l'essence ... on monte les taxes de GO ... et c'est toujours le peuple qui paye !!!

8240 2018-08-30 08:01:54 MALICIOUS DAMAGE TO TRANSFORMER 

The transformer appeared to have been maliciously damaged so that it would leak oil onto the fire. These facts are simply not consistent with a fire originating from an electrical fault. Eikenhof substation.

Funny coincidence... occurred just after came out of warranty. Faced with £7k bill. Inadequate delayed complaint response. Awful
8246 2018-08-30 08:01:09 DIA is a fake news organization like Iraq WMD and apparently Mattis is playing along like a good puppet. All they want is money, oil, fuel and resources.
8247 2018-08-30 08:01:03 First tweet ever!!! Haven’t gotten a full nights rest in over 2 years it feels like! One thing with the oil field is you’ve gotta take the good with the bad!

8252 2018-08-30 08:00:10 thats before we take into account increased rates rents and rampant property inflation when general inflation and interest rates were kept low oil prices dropped but petrol prices rose so did electricity prices and food basics while wages stagnated and fell behind cost of living
8253 2018-08-30 08:00:07 When u pour oil in a hole, snakes, rats, ants come out. This exactly happened in last 4 years. Modi govt's different initiatives specially Demonitisation burned the asses of so many libradus, thy had to come out openly.

8274 2018-08-30 07:54:43 I think you are overlooking the balance of payments issue. No more cars to export. Oil revenues. Deficit sky rockets. Pound plummets. Bankers unhappy. Oil is priced in USD; however low the £ falls, oil still has a value.

8319 2018-08-30 07:44:49 Falkan Islands? New Zealand? How about all of the British Islands in the Caribbean? Canada as well. Think of all of the Indigenous people massacred, & the rest who got put on reservations. Tribal lands are now in danger again fo to climate change & digging for oil & pipelines.
8320 2018-08-30 07:44:42 2. Under Obama we certainly did more (but not a lot more) to limit the humanitarian disaster, but the bottom line is that until the West breaks free from our need for MidEast oil, we are going to be involved in their various regional wars, under any president.

8331 2018-08-30 07:42:11 USA funded ISIS. Russia came in to eliminate them. 

This all happened because Syria refused to let USA create a pipeline from Iraq to Europe in effort to take down Russia's economy (50% of their income comes from oil sales). Their is equilibrium of power, and US doesn't like it.
8332 2018-08-30 07:42:06 You missed the entire point of my argument. If #Calexit happens, the US can (and will) stop paying for oil it doesn't need. If anything, Donald would be slamming giant tariffs on Saudi Arabia before re-negotiations can start.

8393 2018-08-30 07:28:22 If we continue to take sovereign loans and fail to put these funds in economically viable investments, time will come when the oil revenue will not meet interest payments on these loans.

8575 2018-08-30 06:53:59 I’ve used a lot of hair oils/serums and the best one I’ve found is the garnier coconut oil. Still searching for the best shampoo for my hair
8576 2018-08-30 06:53:58 Hey! We sprayed the pan with coconut oil spray and we cook it for the least amount of time on the package, checked it with a toothpick and if it wasn’t done we cooked it just 3-5 minutes more watching it closely.

8578 2018-08-30 06:53:22 Busy with preparation for asking questions on DeMo , steep inflation in prices of petrol/diesel vs how not to compromise with almost doubled tax revenue, why CAD , FD etc macros not as what these were when avg Oil cost was almost 50 % high and tax gain was 50 % low etc

8586 2018-08-30 06:52:20 Personally I would want to diversify and rely on government subsidies as little as possible... organic crops would definitely be a consideration and the potential $ from hemp (CBD oil) seems to good to ignore.
8587 2018-08-30 06:52:02 Boiling in oil.
8588 2018-08-30 06:51:50 Oil Price now $77.61 and our #populist leaders think we are an island and that our #racist rhetoric of hate is only making the very people they promise to speaking for poorer, #stupidisstupid
8589 2018-08-30 06:51:43 Cmng to ur first stmnt,purchase of crude oil was alwys thru LOC or by othr means like commodity trading & its a trade cycle which a sovereign in Internationl market follow, 

Jul'15 is whn USA reached deal with Iran (sanction was lifted) & thn India engaged freely trading w/ Iran
8590 2018-08-30 06:51:23 Is charring an option? Or soaking the points in old engine oil?

8593 2018-08-30 06:49:57 I tried TO niaciminide for about a year and didn't see any effect from it. But honestly everyone is different and everyone thinks it's great so! I personally saw more improvement with their Alpha Arbutin. Also I miss my rose hip oil so much =[
8594 2018-08-30 06:49:24 // @GalvanOchoa  Some words on crude oil refinaries in the U S A... That could be in the works for Mexico.  Think about it.
8595 2018-08-30 06:49:23 I’m trying to find the right one. Currently I’m using shampoo and conditioner free of paraphens, a Lush moisturizer and tea tree oil but it’s still dry

8598 2018-08-30 06:48:41 Aregbe, Fashiola and Oshio championed it, saying you can’t save for the rainy day when it’s already raining. Only for the same people to turn around and feed their sheepish followers the stupid propaganda that PDP failed to save during period of high oil prices. Mad men
8599 2018-08-30 06:48:23 Brent crude is the highest it has been since 2015.  It's not to do with oil.  Venezuela is now a fascist country, that's why it is failing.

8601 2018-08-30 06:48:01 It’s really interesting, India is not willing to cut Oil imports from Iran despite the US sanctions ….to my mind, it’s fine decision taken by the government…..Iran strategically matters a lot for India. @Ramananda @ShaidaAbdali @Iyervval @Iran @MEAIndia @PMOIndia @vinay1011

8606 2018-08-30 06:46:55 You are wrong about norways oil piggybank. It is currently being drained for welfares sake. But Finland is a good argument. Nevertheless welfare alone isnt socialism and the entirety of Scandinavia regularly falls pray to the whims of the market and metanational corporate
8607 2018-08-30 06:46:33 It's called US sanctions put into place by Obama and continued by Trump. If they can't sell their oil and can't import food, people starve. It's the US empire raping the most oil-rich country in the world because they didn't want to sell their oil to the US anymore.
8608 2018-08-30 06:46:27 What if we're all just cells inside a huge organism and all the countries that are at war over oil are oedema and all the famish is necrosis?
All the infrastructure is part of the cell and every death and destruction is by phagocytosis and it's all just natural?

8625 2018-08-30 06:43:40 Do you know how much Doller strengthened world wide & how much oil prices increased..?? Don't try to establish yourself FOOLISH. Behave like an Educated Person except Typical Old Fashioed Politician who tries to get Votes by Provocative methods.
8626 2018-08-30 06:43:32 Indeed, more olive oil, less red meat, less dairy and a more relaxed life style.
8627 2018-08-30 06:43:19 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
8628 2018-08-30 06:43:14 Really? That’s not the report coming out of Syria, which included USA conditioning its withdrawal from Syria on oil companies getting a percentage of oil coming out of Northern Syria. USA army works for oil companies not The people. That’s treason.

8630 2018-08-30 06:42:44 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
8631 2018-08-30 06:42:43 Instead of maligning others start with benign of the self, talk about your sincere effort for the people by the people & earn real respect not barrels of oil ...
8632 2018-08-30 06:42:38 WTF MY FRIEND IS A CEO AND OWNS AN OIL COMPANY SO HES RICH AND HAD A PERSONAL DRIVER PICK US UP AND TREAT US

8635 2018-08-30 06:41:41 I have doubts on the quality of the tar used... as is the case with all road repairs... May be the are using black oil in higher percentage than actual tar?? This explains why it gets washed out after rain...
8636 2018-08-30 06:41:35 第一文型:石油価格は変動する。
Oil prices change.
8637 2018-08-30 06:41:33 หิว
8638 2018-08-30 06:41:32 Not sure if this helps, but I went from washing every day to every 3 days or so. Using a dry shampoo spray that I brushed out on the third day seemed to help keep it looking clean while the scalp retaught itself how much oil to produce. It takes a bit to show progress

8646 2018-08-30 06:39:52 Air fryers can do literally anything: slice fine, toss in the tiniest glance of oil, and throw in the fryer, re-tossing every 3-5 minutes until crispy. Delicious chips!

8656 2018-08-30 06:37:44 For soup, cook minced shallots in oil, then simmer with chicken, cilantro, beef broth and asparagus. Top with scallions.
8657 2018-08-30 06:37:43 Their little backpacks had a damn @Shell gasoline logo on them. Dafuq? Reparations for an oil spill?
8658 2018-08-30 06:37:28 it is extremely difficult to see how oil company CEOs are not more responsible than the rest of us for the carbon released into the atmosphere by humanity over the last decades.
8659 2018-08-30 06:37:20 Is that the oil Brazilian people love injecting into themselves? I think I heard about this. Very sad.
8660 2018-08-30 06:37:12 Probably something in the line of we thank you for the oil money. We will continue to fuck up Sweden for you.. something like that
8661 2018-08-30 06:36:58 Why is gas $4 a gallon? Bruh! I need some stocks in the oil companies I’m Sleep! 
8662 2018-08-30 06:36:57 #UKOG WOW buys out #SOLO something very big could be brewing here why would UKOG do this ask yourself ... Oil on a flyer also at $78 expecting into the $80-$90 short term.
8663 2018-08-30 06:36:55 Hahaha! You can feel the positive effect of the oil diba? Tawa ako ng tawa nung mabasa ko to nahawa ka na sa kabaliwan ko sa oils!
8664 2018-08-30 06:36:54 More evidence of the reality of 'fake news'. The mainstream media is manipulated by its owners & editors to serve the government of the day on which it relies for briefings. In this case, Saudi Arabia was to be shielded from public criticism as we rely on it for oil & arms sales.

8667 2018-08-30 06:36:07 Whales survive centuries even when humans need their oil. Later they're saved by the discover of fossil oil. But human tracks on the sea disrupt the ocean circle. Their food will die before them.

8674 2018-08-30 06:33:05 US sanctions on Venezuela trying to strangle it into handing over oil wealth is not the fault of socialism. Try again.
8675 2018-08-30 06:32:49 Once in a while, take the longer scenic route. Walk rather than drive. Smell some flowers. Bring a smile to a stranger’s face. Buy something expensive. Have 1 more glass of wine than normal. Drop a little oil into your life’s machine occasionally. Occasionally o. Don’t lose focus
8676 2018-08-30 06:32:44 Where did this happen & when? Presumably s/he died while trying to escape a fire caused by people clearing land for palm oil?

8690 2018-08-30 06:28:06 We have been expanding our trade. If the new NAFTA doesn't give Canada everything we want we will be signing off it. And you are 100% right, China will jump in like a hawk. They have been waiting for NAFTA to fail. They are willing to pay world market price on our oil and lumber.

8701 2018-08-30 06:24:56 President Trump judges people by one standard only.

You get nice things in return. #trump

8705 2018-08-30 06:24:06 Nigeria's oil is sweeter, cheaper to refine than Alberta's dirty oil, & they have a very pliable third world gov't.

For he was controlling them
And then we fought the Taliban

8841 2018-08-30 05:58:24 Honestly don’t even know who “Clay Travis” is, but I figure by your grouping him with Cernovich and Posobiec that he’s probably some snake oil grifter who must’ve just determined you’re not in his target demo and blocked you accordingly. Can’t have a heckler calling out the ruse.

8843 2018-08-30 05:58:16 I think you’re right there. Oh I didn’t know he said that. Oh boy! 

I actually never liked him. He reminded me of a snake oil salesman.

8855 2018-08-30 05:55:42 il faut quand même expliquer a tous nos inventeurs de taxe que cela ne règle jamais un Pb c'est juste une taxe. exemple le gas oil ne pollue pas moin parce qu'il a 80% de taxes ! le sel sera toujours aussi mauvais taxé que non taxé et les fabricants paieront la taxe  sel restera

8862 2018-08-30 05:54:34 #Oil prices inched up on Thursday, extending solid gains from the previous session on a fall in U.S. crude inventories and expected disruptions to supply from #Iran and #Venezuela.
8863 2018-08-30 05:54:23 Go no subsidies & I’ll back #coal costs over renewable for at least another 50yrs! Why not ban Arabs from pumping crude oil ?? Only allow electric vehicles run by renewable energy if it’s already cheaper??? Hmm

8865 2018-08-30 05:53:54 I understand why people who own oil, gas and coal companies want to bury, and discredit this information. I don’t understand why consumers feel the need to protect industry giants destroying the planet we all have to live on.

Once Elon Musk wins the battle against Oil lobby, oil prices will fall and remain so.

This is the right time to disinvest such companies and put that money to build infrastructure for Electric vehicles.

8936 2018-08-30 05:39:03 When I fill up my car with gas at any franchise locations like Costco or Shell etc.. I've noticed their prices are much affordable than a local gas station. This is caused by the globalizaton of large oil companies decreasing their prices for mass sales. @geography_411

8995 2018-08-30 05:26:35 The Earth has always changed the climate -- it's a fake narrative to blame it on human life. 

It's like pretending the earth is flat, except it's a liberal gimmick to raise taxes on oil and gasoline -- it was the same as the bogus tobacco lawsuits.
8996 2018-08-30 05:26:26 Hehe, what about oil block s
8997 2018-08-30 05:26:24 That doesn't sound bad to me, my mom was close to that weight after her 3rd kid and I always thought she looked great

9023 2018-08-30 05:21:39 The uptrend in #oil prices over the last year has been putting pressure on the commercial #airline industry. For example, the American airline announced on 28/8 that flights between Chicago and Shanghai will be suspended in Oct due to “current fuel and competitive environment”

9030 2018-08-30 05:20:43 I've got similar skin to yours, and I'm a lush addict, so I recommend Ultrabland or 9 to 5 if you want more of a oil cleanser/makeup remover, Fresh Farmacy if you want a soap, and Herbalism if you want more of a Scrub that also cleanses.

9038 2018-08-30 05:19:38 It explains a lot. Frankly, local council staff lack the skills to monitor the oil and gas industry so the soft option is probably all they are capable of.

9051 2018-08-30 05:17:44 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.
9052 2018-08-30 05:17:33 it’s almost 1:30 which means it’s time to self administer my calming cbd oil and switch to my more boring book

9057 2018-08-30 05:16:03 The solution this one found was researching diet, consumables that were personal favourites, and finding low-fat/non-fat variants, plus substitutes. When baking chocolate cake, skim milk, non-fat egg whites and applesauce instead of oil. :)

9065 2018-08-30 05:13:58 ...That was a bit shaky in 2002 and it's just ridiculous now.

Why allege a conspiracy involving millions when it's already bad enough that the Bush administration blatantly took advantage of 9/11 to invade countries with oil?

9075 2018-08-30 05:11:44 People just don’t know you gotta massage the kale with olive oil or lemon. Too many restaurants don’t do this either. Can be really good in salads!

9092 2018-08-30 05:08:16 I'm just not sure there's any evidence that turning exxon in to a coop would have or will stop the use of oil on the world stage, which seems to be  where a lot of the anti Social Wealth Fund takes head to.

9168 2018-08-30 04:56:33 Could oil in #Libya actually be a unifying factor among the various constituents and formation of a unity government? Another critical component is to have the Central Banks be purged of corruption & mismanagement; and agree on a financial leader & deputy

-oil in vietnamese is almost identical to oil in cantonese

9267 2018-08-30 04:39:52 the kind i have is actually from a toothache relief kit, so it's diluted enough to be used on my gums! clove oil apparently is a miracle worker for tooth pain, but I can barely get over the smell/taste enough to let it work. It makes me gag.
9268 2018-08-30 04:39:51 I use coconut oil to take off my makeup, but then I use an actual face wash to wash my face

9276 2018-08-30 04:38:03 I'm sure teddy Roosevelt's critics said similar things when he was breaking up oil and steel monopolies, but it clearly wasn't the wrong thing to do. You've gotta open your mind.

9281 2018-08-30 04:37:30 cbd: pain relief, anxiety, inflammation, muscle relaxer, fights acne, restores brain neurotransmitters, etc.

9285 2018-08-30 04:37:01 Cloves are super strong & to be used sparingly. I have a recipe for pumpkin chocolate chip muffins that uses 1/4 tsp cloves. It's just enough to add depth to the spices but not overpower the other flavours. Clove oil is too intense to be applied to your skin, much less your gums!

9297 2018-08-30 04:35:12 There are better ways create jobs and help peopleof the earth than ruin the beauty of the two provinces.  Just because there is oil doesn’t mean it has to drilled. We have the opportunity to actually use energy as asource of fuel. I am shocked you don’t find this more thrilling
9298 2018-08-30 04:35:02 I just want my body rub down with some baby oil..... man that would be life
9299 2018-08-30 04:34:57 I know that the Sahara and Libya are supposed to have a lot of oil and gas, gemstones and precious metals between the two, and I did read that nobody is allowed to mine there. Is that really true?

9347 2018-08-30 04:26:17 Unfortunately the media  faces are not talking about these real issues. But I remember when Obama was president, they kept showing that busted pipeline  in Louisiana and asking how the leaking oil would affect his legacy. Anybody remember that?

9352 2018-08-30 04:25:34 U.S. stocks plowed to new records amid a broad rally in technology shares, as investors speculated the Trump administration will make progress this week on trade spats. Oil surged toward $70 a barrel.
The yield on 10-year Treasuries held at 2.88 percent.
9353 2018-08-30 04:25:11 If that doesn't work, we get bigger rocks and coat them in oil and light them on fire.

9355 2018-08-30 04:24:45 You use anything else with batteries in? Yep? Then your argumnent would apply to those things too. And it's not as if the oil industry is any cleaner or more ethical.

9357 2018-08-30 04:24:39 Leave them .. what else do we have as a solution .. 

1. Saudia bailing us out with roughly $8-10 Billion (Through IDB + Oil Rebate) but this comes with strings attached to side with Islamic Coalition (anti-Iran)
2. IMF with all strings attached to inflation.
9358 2018-08-30 04:24:33 seriously, how does ANYONE like anything with cloves? I just put clove oil on my sore tooth/gums and it took every ounce of willpower not to puke it back out. It. is. disgusting.

And you talk about price of diesel ??   Don't do that silly politics because now India knows what are the facts.
9368 2018-08-30 04:22:41 Blows my mind how much of European imperialism was about rum and spices. Say what you want about the American military, but oil at least seems important. Imagine if we invaded Iraq for fucking paprika.

9393 2018-08-30 04:18:15 It's up in a bun & covered most of the time so I don't need to brush it *too* often, but that also lets it get matted because I forget about it.

So I have a lot of oils and a steel-toothed pick to help me through through times. Argan oil is the shit, and smells GREAT.

9395 2018-08-30 04:17:51 People in America commute to work. If fuel prices go up, people have less money to spend. If you remember, gas went to $5 a gallon towards the end of Bush 43 and bingo a massive recession. Keeping Iran out of the oil market will do the same thing next year.

9397 2018-08-30 04:17:06 I know the Kochs and Trump are having a tiff.  But they share much more in common than any minor disagreement. Oil/gas for one.  Tax cuts. Deregulation. Gutting the EPA. You can believe that Koch money has no influence on NPR. I believe it does even if only subtle.

9400 2018-08-30 04:16:22 He don’t understand economics. He just needs oil prices at cheaper rate it doesn’t matter for him that government going under dept to give subsidy. It doesn’t matter for him even if congress government has left billions of dollars of debt to be paid to Iran.
9401 2018-08-30 04:16:18 In the US, you do that with fatty salad dressings/bacon bits/chicken that are 2x the calories of everything else, thereby undoing any nutritional virtue the salad may have had.

I think in the coming political moment you will realize how shallow  your statement is.. France is socialistic and democratic.  The lack of distinction between leadership and policy is  shallow.

9427 2018-08-30 04:12:48 I went to Target to buy some essential oils and when I opened the “stress relieving” oil I accidentally spilled the bottle on my carpet.

9430 2018-08-30 04:12:33 Other ideas: 1) watch the Serena Williams videos that have recently dropped. Let her magnificence be a balm. 2) Look at pictures of Cate Blanchett at the UN. 3) Eat something with a fuckton of garlic, ginger, and chili oil. 4)  Marijuana and Bob Ross on Netflix. 

Take care.

You can also make desert ones with red bean paste, although that’s more an acquired taste (I love red bean)
9472 2018-08-30 04:03:49 I was gonna be all, “Try a neti pot. Maybe tea tree oil?  Does coconut oil have antifungal properties?” but if I’m honest in my intention to send healing to you, then just get some single-malt scotch, preferably an Islay one (Lagavulin, Laphroiag, etc), and start drinking.

9491 2018-08-30 03:58:07 This seems possibly misleading. Models have shown that even with very optimistic EV growth rates, oil demand growth from vehicles will continue e.g. beyond 2035. Additionally, much of the demand will come from developing nations, which will not have EV infrastructure.

9552 2018-08-30 03:48:18 Demolition of the cafeteria extension at national oil opposite  Taj mall. Church behind(house of grace) also demolished! 
9553 2018-08-30 03:48:18 Ever try a similar cooking technique, but with rosemary\black pepper\olive oil\garlic (heavy on rosemary\pepper) some of the best venison I ever had was with that method.

9555 2018-08-30 03:47:40 命を燃やすか
9556 2018-08-30 03:47:32 Tighten up the bolts on the million $ jet that the pattsies who believe this B.S. paid for so these snake oil salesmen can travel around the world on the dimes of their desperate constituents?
9557 2018-08-30 03:47:09 Coconut oil or jojoba oil but coconut oil makes my skin a little more oily but it helps
9558 2018-08-30 03:47:04 U do constant oil changes and check spark plugs. For gap. Filter fuel for the burban.  I know had one the whole reason I sold it. It's a fucken hog on gas.
9559 2018-08-30 03:46:48 Good Morning @dpradhanbjp Are all contracts in Indian Oil Coordination according to CVC guidelines and prices based on the correct market value?

9561 2018-08-30 03:46:16 That's such a great saying... Oops. I forgot to oil my rifle tonight, and sharpen my bayonet... Darn it.
9562 2018-08-30 03:46:00 And put some Olive oil in that same water while you are at it. You will never eat pasta any other way once you've had it like this. :) #cooking #tips

9571 2018-08-30 03:45:08 Ideals our politicians follow are petty parody of greed for money & power. Nothing much, nothing less. Evident they are feeding on ignorance of uneducated & poor. Snake oil sellers don't last, but we've got lots. Nepal needs #education to rid of this pests & #soonWewill together
9572 2018-08-30 03:45:07 Baby oil, coconut oil or olive oil.
9573 2018-08-30 03:45:00 I don’t get it. They are going to need an oil change for the long drive back to Florida?

9579 2018-08-30 03:44:17 Very disgruntled about wasting a good big canvas by unwittingly mixing oil & acrylic paints. Unwilling to give up on it. But now I have to - I just put a sodding palette knife right through it, trying to clean the oil paint off. So peeved.
9580 2018-08-30 03:44:12 You gotta go for ugly niggas like me that’s gonna fix shit and change ur oil. A MAN
9581 2018-08-30 03:44:09 Jokes on you, CA consumes far more oil than the Persian Gulf states can produce. If anything, #Calexit would force CA to pay for Saudi proxy wars to keep the new nation from collapsing into an energy crisis long before CA can establish a viable green energy source.

9588 2018-08-30 03:43:24 Shocked that cameras were on sight!  Curious if everyone’s yoga mat is made from hemp or rubber.  Alberta oil & gas says you’re welcome if it’s rubber.
9589 2018-08-30 03:43:19 @guarnaschelli so..i tried the Ricotta w/saltnpepper and evoo...didn't like it w/the evoo so tried it w/sesame oil and it gave it a nice nutty flavor...to break up the richness, sprinkled some crystallized lime on it...yum!

9595 2018-08-30 03:42:36 @SadeABC @RyanFieldABC @billritter7 @LeeGoldbergABC7 Let’s face it The NY governor and the NYC mayor just do not get along. Two strong personalities they are like oil and water they do not  mix.
9596 2018-08-30 03:42:21 Love cucumber sautéed in rice vinegar and sesame oil with roasted and crushed sesame seeds with steamed short grain sushi grade rice...yum, must be the Asian in me.  Try it, you might like it.  Like most things, it’s all in how it’s prepared. 
9597 2018-08-30 03:41:59 Soak your hair in coconut oil for about an hour before you wash it. It takes a few washes to get it out, but it makes a HUGE difference
9598 2018-08-30 03:41:52 Believe the memes! Jet-fuel can’t melt steel beams!  Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!

9600 2018-08-30 03:41:42 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
9601 2018-08-30 03:41:41 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
9602 2018-08-30 03:41:34 Mueller’s 2011 “Golden Triangle” speech re: corporations (oil Petrostates) upending Govn’t. Him & Comey watched in 2014 as Giuliani, RonPaul, FGraham, Buchanan publicly endorsed Putin’s leadership. That being only the end result of 2012 Benghazi & 2013 Snowden in Moscow events.
9603 2018-08-30 03:41:30 @Marshall9News @KyleClark Unmentioned in discussion re the 2500 foot setback is how much land is ACTUALLY taken from oil production when long-distance directional drilling is used to site wells away from homes but the oil underneath is still accessible. Industry is fearmongering.

9606 2018-08-30 03:40:41 Iran had a violent fundamentalist revolution and then held 50 hostages for 1.5 years. That doesn't make it a strong country.

Its large population means there isn't that much oil per capita (though more than Egypt). It just hasn't been a strong country for centuries now.

9619 2018-08-30 03:39:16 In out of office email to team, used the Ernie Ladd quote about having to wring my brain out as reasoning behind taking next week off. Reality? Oil changes, car inspection, probably a trip to the zoo.

9633 2018-08-30 03:37:43 This cracks me up. It exposes Obama for what he was, a man with no clue on how to lead a Country, a fraud, a snake oil salesman.

9661 2018-08-30 03:33:45 First let them pull themselves out of economic crisis and then work towards a more sustainable economic model.

I imagine if the US blocks Iranian oil and Iran blocks oil through the Strait of Hormuz, Venezuelan oil looks promising.

9682 2018-08-30 03:30:41 @fordnation @GregRickford Does this removal of the cap&trade cost from natural gas also apply to home heating fuel oil. It should do so. Many rural Ontarians do not have natural gas available and depend on fuel oil for their home heating energy. Please clarify this.

9692 2018-08-30 03:28:24 That's true. They're good ideas (I think) but hey, I'd never, ever want to enter Parliament! I'd vote for a laterally-thinking Politician like a shot, though.
Squeakiest wheel frequently gets the wrong oil, it seems...

9696 2018-08-30 03:27:37 Papusha Rocket ICO - is the latest technology to destroy oil refineries residues around the world. Instead of destroying flora and fauna, refineries get gasoline and diesel fuel for selling. #Papusha #ICO #Crowdsale #Bitcoin #Blockchain #Token #ETH #Ethereum #TokenSale

9698 2018-08-30 03:27:29 Drump is winning so massively he doesn't have to think about any of that. Imagine a firehose running from one of the world's top oil producers, Russia, directly into your own accounts. Now tell me how does that feel..
9699 2018-08-30 03:27:03 This morning, I left California, a state that is literally, currently on fire, and came home to New Jersey, where the temps are twenty degrees *warmer.*

Goddamn you, climate change, oil industry, lobbyist groups, and Republicans.
9700 2018-08-30 03:26:46 HuffPo praising oil revenues? 
9701 2018-08-30 03:25:42 I've never had it, but it looks like generally the same things any GF pasta would be made from. I found one online made out of potato, eggs, and an oil
9702 2018-08-30 03:25:42 He did the same to Kaitlyn & Haleigh a while back. No biggie. No one wants lotion or oil all over their bra! Brett’s massages look like they feel AMAZING!
9703 2018-08-30 03:25:42 It's cool, just print more money. Snake oil and bullshit. Know what you're buying.
9704 2018-08-30 03:25:41 في اي منطقه في سويسرا الاوتيل اذا سمحتو؟؟؟؟؟
9705 2018-08-30 03:25:38 They concede nothing because oil and gas doesn’t understand science or peoples’ rights. Organized money will be beat by organized people!

9710 2018-08-30 03:25:02 The Sierra Club is a environmental activist group like Green Peace, Tides Foundation to stop oil & gas, coal industries. They are very left leaning.

9715 2018-08-30 03:23:53 I am going to harp on this until November! If u live in Colorado, vote NO on 97. It will effectively end all oil and as production in Colorado! Don’t take my word for it, do ur own research. 97 states an oil site cannot be with-in 2500 feet of a school or residential area.

Me: i love him. i love having a skeleton buddy. every group of friends should have one.
9717 2018-08-30 03:23:36 I think taxpayers might find the takings initiative more controversial given its potential to bankrupt local governments. And oil and gas corporations have those same millions to push it.
9718 2018-08-30 03:23:25 Biggest reason is low crude oil prices
9719 2018-08-30 03:23:23 I could probably get used to a lifestyle as an essential oil tycoon.
9720 2018-08-30 03:23:12 Coal is great, you wouldn't have electricity or many other things without coal OR oil. Caged kids was Obama's deal - nice try, but that's a full on lie. Why don't you libs do anything BUT complain? Oh, because Hillary lost. Pathetic. Oh BTW, #WINNING #MAGA

9728 2018-08-30 03:21:42 China in a corner, Russia being drained after trump convinced Europe to stop buying oil from Russia. You want to talk about deficit? Are you saying that the deficit would have gone down with someone else, say hc? Or another dem who wants socialism. Our Economy is thriving!

9731 2018-08-30 03:21:13 trump would only cure cancer so he could purposely withhold it from minorities or poor people who couldn’t afford it.  besides, any medicine trump said would cure something, doesn’t. He didn’t earn his reputation as a snake oil salesman for doing good things for humanity

9742 2018-08-30 03:19:38 Er, nope. I've never thought to put straight petroleum jelly in my hair. That kind of scares me after the honey and coconut oil mask I did a few months ago that took so long to wash out.

9747 2018-08-30 03:18:30 Not a chance. That's a horse. Eric looks nothing like a horse. He's basically a hairy cyst with an excess of gums and hair oil, in roughly humanoid form.
9748 2018-08-30 03:18:19 Remember Midnight Oil?
9749 2018-08-30 03:17:54 Meet a nice guy from Nigeria working for Bell Expressvu. Recent immigrant. His observations: 
why do we import oil from Saudi Arabia into East vs Alberta?
why can’t CANADA get a trade deal done with USA and Mexico can? 
why doesn’t @JustinTrudeau care about the West? @jkenney
9750 2018-08-30 03:17:51 It sure is! I must say as a general use oil the Haberdapple Runespice is especially succulent right now? What seems to ail you right now? Do you have Quartermans Knuckle? I have just the thing for that!

9757 2018-08-30 03:17:17 What does 2x “richer” mean?  Sugar and oil emulsion.  Not milk or cream.  Note to all coffee sellers, you can get half and half in room temperature pods just like coffee-mate.  Please do.
9758 2018-08-30 03:17:16 He voted against a lottery.

He voted against a tax increase.

He voted against a bill that doesn’t designate 100% of BP oil money to the coast.

I’d say he accomplished everything we wanted him to accomplish.
9759 2018-08-30 03:17:13 I know it’s a fad at the moment, but this seems like a prime scenario to try CBD oil

9785 2018-08-30 03:13:54 Not surprised by his demeanor but by normal standards he's still presiding over a failed state that continues to spiral. < 50% of the pre war population is under gov control.

U.S. stocks plowed to new records amid a broad rally in technology shares, as investors speculated the Trump administration will make progress this week on trade spats. Oil surged toward $70 a barrel.
The yield on 10-year Treasuries held at 2.88 percent.

9830 2018-08-30 03:06:32 Tobacco companies were sued by gov’s because they knew smoking was harmful. Big pharma is getting sued for its role in the opioid crisis. My guess is oil/ gas/ fossil fuel industry will see the same thing in the years to come. #ClimateAction

9837 2018-08-30 03:05:34 You’ve got to be kidding! More “wealthfare” to the top 1% pukes that already hauled away nearly 90% of the GOP TaxScam and for which the GOP put USA TRILLIONS & TRILLIONS of Dollars IN DEEP DEBT, likely robbing us all of our national future? Say No to filthy rich oil companies!

9841 2018-08-30 03:04:24 I'm going to assume you're relatively young. Allow me to present an analogy. You buy a new car. Around 3000 miles it's time to change the oil, but don't because why? It's running great after all. The car might be ok for a while because its still young enough.
9842 2018-08-30 03:04:22 After I posted, I noticed that on the bottle I am using it's says coconut oil. I didn't even know I was using it. I have been going to CBDplus, the California cures. It works for me.

9846 2018-08-30 03:02:58 It's not just socialism that destroyed Venezuela but massive budget deficits and importing goods instead of home production while relying on the sale of their oil to cover the cost of their loans. As soon as oil prices dropped they could not pay their debts. Sound familiar? #MAGA

9965 2018-08-30 02:44:34 Mr Racer

If you accept that oil is finite, it's use is growing, and it's price is subject to geopolitical shocks, you'll realize that, at some point, it will become unaffordable for most.

Ms Melendez's efforts to deny reality are not an option.

What do you suggest we do?
9966 2018-08-30 02:44:06 It takes time ! I’m not into buying expensive products and if I do lol please one at a timeee . But water and moisturize with oil. I been using wild growth for a min. Hair vitamins and conditioning. Also protective hairstyles helped me too braids wigs etc..

9974 2018-08-30 02:42:45 Summary... all these issues are nuanced and careful science is needed. What doesn't help is blind political sheep saying "climate has always changed", "It's a Chinese hoax" or "the science is settled except for deniers paid by Big Oil"
9975 2018-08-30 02:42:31 I dont know about others but all tea tree oil products mmg suitable for acne prone oily skin type :)

9978 2018-08-30 02:41:35 @PolisForCO How about taxing the the oil and gas companies a higher rate of tax & use that money to protect Colorado from fracking.
9979 2018-08-30 02:41:34 You do that. Keep believing what those snake oil salesmen are selling. ... Why does their color matter??? Racist, much???
9980 2018-08-30 02:41:32 vegans use olive oil as lube
9981 2018-08-30 02:40:58 One dip in the sriracha mayo sauce I make and you'd have a different opinion.

Also, I use really good olive oil in my mayo bases. If I really want to kick things up in the taste department, I add some chinese 5 spice.
9982 2018-08-30 02:40:57 I mixed a little bit of an amber essential oil in with my body coconut oil moisturizer and let me tell y’all 

I smell divine

9992 2018-08-30 02:40:00 People are making a big dead out of nothing these days. Arguing over sexual orientation, flags, race, and guns. When people should be worried about our future. The system has us so uptight that we are fighting each other instead of the ones who are  monopolizing our water and oil
9993 2018-08-30 02:39:58 Hm.  For someone who fell for a snake oil salesman who harms your family, you sure are handy at calling other people morons.

10006 2018-08-30 02:37:53 I went in for an oil change tonight and I left with a brand new car, so if that tells anyone how much of a sucker I am for a deal....
10007 2018-08-30 02:37:40 Lavender oil saves lives, but seriously anxiety is dangerous dude. It caused hives & it can cause heart palpitations so just be mindful and aware of yourself boo  I’m here if you ever feel even slightly overwhelmed!
10008 2018-08-30 02:37:39 CNRL and Suncor did jump on board with carbon taxing. Pretty sure they did so in hope that being climate friendly would help increase gov’t support. Waste of time. Trudeau’s gov’t is out to screw the oil industry at the cost of the economy.
10009 2018-08-30 02:37:34 kalo gue sih make cleansing oil sebelum mandi setelah pulang kerja.
10010 2018-08-30 02:37:32 You can use peppermint oil mixed with water and spray it around the house and will keep spiders away without harming your pets
10011 2018-08-30 02:36:51 Isn't it time for your spoon of cod liver oil and an evening episode of "Matlock"? That's what all the other doddering seniors are doing.

Don't worry, you can wake up at 1 am to tweet "No collusion" or "Covfefe" or whatever.
