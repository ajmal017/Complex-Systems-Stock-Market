12 2018-09-29 23:57:42 Eating Healthy:

Eating healthy foods is a big part of having clear skin. If you eat too much sugar or unhealthy foods, your skin will produce more oil and break out more. Eating a balanced portion of fruits, veggies, and protien will most likely help with having clear skin.
13 2018-09-29 23:57:28 also try castor oil and hot oil treatment plus if you blow dry your hair with the oil in it expedite the process

38 2018-09-29 23:55:53 Face Masks:

Face masks work most of the time, but be careful with the sensitivity of your skin. You might break out even more if the mask is too strong or harsh. 

Best Masks: 
•Baking soda + coconut oil mask
•Aloe Vera + Tomato Juice Mask
•Oat Meal + Coconut Oil Mask
39 2018-09-29 23:55:53 @realDonaldTrump ... A US bank buys $9 billion of Saudi oil. The bank merely adjusts its ledger to show $9B more in the Saudi bank account. It does not cost the bank anything to adjust its ledger. Saudi sees $9B (USD) more in its bank account and thus believes it was paid....

43 2018-09-29 23:55:39 Oil and car lobbyists are to blame
44 2018-09-29 23:55:28 That is crazy talk.  The issue at hand is one more double hulled tanker per day amongst the other 3000 per year that sail out of Vancouver.  The release of CO2 from oil has SAVED the planet and civilization. (record lows). That is how out of sinc the environuts are with reality.

46 2018-09-29 23:55:00 Truth?

Truth? You pretend to know truth? pretend care? rash falsity! You fooled a few not long. Not me. Not many. Truth and Avenatti are more irreconcilable, opposite than oil and water. You and truth cannot be uttered in the same breath. Your very name banishes truth, good, all

50 2018-09-29 23:53:15 1/A few industry executives? Suncor, Cenovus, and CNRL now control a large majority of oil sands production, which at 2.7MM b/d dwarfs conventional. Blithely dismissing CEOs Steve Williams, Murray Edwards, and Brian Ferguson seems like an odd strategy.

55 2018-09-29 23:52:36 Sure!  So why villify oil?  We need to preserve oil because of its limited supply.  But we don't tax for CO2.  That is crazy talk.  We need to find an alternative or our world as we know it won't be around and it is not because of climate change.

63 2018-09-29 23:51:06 If your engine leaks a little oil on the ground then it's probably old enough and it could usd a cleaning. Have someone do that knows what they are doing because there are electronics that should not get wet.

73 2018-09-29 23:49:03 This is why I have misgivings about the surge in vegan products made with coconut oil. I genuinely do not understand why non-dairy cheeses made with soy are being replaced with products made from coconut oil.
74 2018-09-29 23:48:50 Are you going to tell your base that on December 27, the Trump administration rolls back all oil regulations? Which means we may experience off of our shores another BP like oil spill? Why are interest rates climbing so fast? How are you going to upgrade Americas infrastructure?

85 2018-09-29 23:47:11 Now is the time I believe, to regulate the oil industry again here in the Philippines. Nagkakaroon ng pagsasamantala sa pagtataas at pagbaba ng mga presyo ng langig kada linggo. The endgame: The Filipino people suffer always.

94 2018-09-29 23:45:53 It’s almost as if someone was really, really interested in oil. But, surely, they wouldn’t overthrow a government, or invade a country for oil. Just some good ole US “ freedom and democracy” , “winning the hearts and minds”. You know....
95 2018-09-29 23:45:45 Mam kuch oil prices par bhi boliye????
96 2018-09-29 23:45:42 You'd think that, but a lot of incidents go unreported, suspects go unpunished, because no one forces the police or judge to act.  A law to protect them, like the one we already have on the books, helps with that.  It's not an extra law.  It's needed.  Unless you're an asshole.

118 2018-09-29 23:42:55 Firstly.. Get rid of the toxic chemical rubbish called RAMA.. Use butter, lard, or coconut oil or ghee.

147 2018-09-29 23:40:14 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
148 2018-09-29 23:40:09 Sounds like an enforcement problem, not a need another law problem
149 2018-09-29 23:40:03 The essential oil people?
150 2018-09-29 23:39:44 The stuffs crap, all of it! Doesn’t come anywhere near oil, all w/b have there issues!

152 2018-09-29 23:39:17 I'm referring more to energy sector investment. Our resources are being given away for free to the American despite WTI  being north of $70. The fact that large end users such as Shell, Stat Oil, ConocoPhillips have pulled out of the oilsands should say something.
153 2018-09-29 23:39:07 What’s your opinion on Lockheed Martin and Shell Oil
154 2018-09-29 23:38:57 W: He cut holes in my ugly sweatshirt I use for working on the cars. I'm NOT dressing to the 9s to change oil you prick

157 2018-09-29 23:38:25 This isn’t something to boast about. Oil is dirty and antiquated. We need clean/renewable energy.
158 2018-09-29 23:37:58 lmaooooooooooo. i'm crying  look at jesus like "sorry bro you know castor oil can only do so much"
159 2018-09-29 23:37:49 Do you need his NI number and proof of employment before you’ll accept this person worked in the oil industry? It must really yank your chain you can’t be condescending to somebody because they actually know more about a subject than you. Show some humility

162 2018-09-29 23:37:05 Big deal, paid actors again? You're a con man, a snake oil salesman......
163 2018-09-29 23:36:49 Are you sure it isn't motor oil?
164 2018-09-29 23:36:46 USA produces more oil now than anyone.. even Saudi Arabia. The US gets a pittance of oil from Iran and has for many years.. nothing to do with Trump. The USA is leading now due to new drilling techniques and fracking developed at Texas A&M and U. TX.  You're welcome.

178 2018-09-29 23:35:17 Father said no. It is cooked in oil and he uses white Karo syrup on it. He does not like maple syrup.
179 2018-09-29 23:34:54 Okay good. Oil that scalp!!
180 2018-09-29 23:34:54 Use any hair oil like olive oil or coconut oil on damp hair. Applying oil or product on damp hair absorbs better.
181 2018-09-29 23:34:50 It's so weird to live in State College, come home to Oil City for the weekend, and then watch a game that's being recorded three miles from where I live.
182 2018-09-29 23:34:46 Thanks! I loved it. Romaine and baby spinach tossed in olive oil and apple cider vinegar, with kalamata olives, sautéed mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, avocado, hard salami, pepperoni, grilled chicken, fresh mozzarella, and fried onions.
183 2018-09-29 23:34:31 If olive oil comes from olives where does baby oil come from
184 2018-09-29 23:34:24 1. Parent's did nothing to curb carbon emissions.
2. Parent's covered up climate change with geoengineering
3. Parent's denied true causes of the 9/11 building collapses.
4. Parent's implemented and escalated deadly organized stalking.
5. Parent's did nothing to get off of oil.

188 2018-09-29 23:33:50 No, vegetable oils replaced saturated fat. Saturated fat blocks hunger. Polyunsaturated fat (vegetable oil) doesn't. This caused an increase in carb consumption. + More fructose, + more processed carbs,.. all leads to obesity and T2D.

192 2018-09-29 23:33:20 Didn’t think you were buddy.  As you know, I’ve tried moving towards water based products and there are benefits, but much prefer the finish of oil based paints on exterior woodwork..
193 2018-09-29 23:33:15 Just cooked with avocado oil and ITS SO GOOD
194 2018-09-29 23:33:07 There is no oil here go away
195 2018-09-29 23:33:02 Turmeric face masks, papaya face mask and lemon face mask are good for dark spots. Oatmeal yogurt masks, tea tree oil and lemon are good for white heads. And there’s more just look it up. Avocado and coconut masks are good for the face period too!

207 2018-09-29 23:29:43 Sigh.... of course there's issues with the oil pan plug.

Also, seriously thinking it'd be fun to flavor this w/ cherry koolaid.
218 2018-09-29 23:28:10 Did you guys fix the oil burning in all your vehicles?...............................Have an 2011 Forester that is an oil sucker, bought a Legacy 2017 that looks like is going the same route.
219 2018-09-29 23:28:03 Once all the oil is added, add the potatoes and mix well. Some of the starch will mix in the dressing to thicken/stabilize it.

226 2018-09-29 23:27:02 So, usually the oil only lasts for 2-3 days, depending on the kind. Then you can just add a different one :-)

228 2018-09-29 23:26:33 We're so quick to be disgusted at parasites such as mosquitoes, but we are effectively parasites ourselves by slaughtering animals, harvesting vegetables, using oil and fossil fuels, et cetera. We are worse than mosquitoes, both statistically and ethically.
229 2018-09-29 23:26:32 Add the oil a couple drops at a time and whisk. Add more when the previous addition is fully mixed. It will incorporate slowly at first, but soon it will mix right in and larger amounts can be added at once (like making mayo).
230 2018-09-29 23:26:24 Where's my blessed oil
231 2018-09-29 23:26:21 The WORST Attorney General in NV history, spending NV money fighting healthcare coverage of those who need it. Pushing EVA’s to deplete NV Education. Pushing selling off our public lands to Oil and mining for fracking ( did you forget we live in a seismic state?)
232 2018-09-29 23:26:20 Oil is not a #fossilfuel that is made up baloney to appear limited. Heck, in Iowa we could be making fuel from natural grasses instead of nasty gmo corn...grasses only provide 5x as much fuel per unit put into its production. Sugar cane is 13x! How much is fuel in South America?

242 2018-09-29 23:24:04 When my Nonna makes Pesto, she makes a lot and seperates it into smaller servings. Once it's cool and before it's stored in the freezer, she tops it off w/ oil to help it keep better. Also easier to cook later.
Lots of different ways of using it so if yours works, run with it.

264 2018-09-29 23:20:30 dude that is not normal. who did your wax? that's not ok. you need to get oil on your face and lotion immedately. do not try and cover it up because makeup will irriate it more
265 2018-09-29 23:20:22 Um, no. You can't get a fair investigation when you wait 30+ years. Mrs. Ford will never get a fair investigation, because she cheated herself out of one. That's like claiming to buy a lemon when the car breaks down after 3 years, and never doing a single oil change.
266 2018-09-29 23:20:10 Its so busy at work but I'm calm and kool while theres pure chaos around me lol. It's probably the cbd oil but id like to think part of it is my suddenly reduced stress.
267 2018-09-29 23:19:54 Okay, here we go.

2 lb potatoes, diced (I prefer Yukon Gold)
2/3 c vinegar (cider vinegar is traditional)
3 shallots or 1 large onion
4-5 tablespoons mustard (I like to mix regular and stone ground)
Approx. 1/2 c oil (bacon fat is traditional, I like olive oil)

276 2018-09-29 23:17:46 Run out of cleaning oil so I washed makeup with cooking oil. It took makeup off but harder part was to get the oil out of my face. Next step. the cleaning foam took some off but there was still some residue.. Om hoping that at least all the makeup washed away

290 2018-09-29 23:16:09 Lol don’t use baby oil thinking it will protect your ashy skin
291 2018-09-29 23:15:41 Babe calm down its not that deep,we're just trying to make you understand love language of men.
292 2018-09-29 23:15:39 Am somebody
293 2018-09-29 23:15:22 Fark all!! Let them get their aid from the their USA masters that they helped commit genocide on Timor>>>for oil and gas<<<< and West Papua for >>>gold, oil and gas<<<<<
294 2018-09-29 23:14:59 Lmao this has happened to me sooo many times You need to moisturize like a bitch. I like cetaphil night cream or the cera ve and then add an oil. This just makes sure the burn isn’t aggravated also the makeup actually will go on better on the texture of the burn
295 2018-09-29 23:14:58 I can’t wait until this surly old SOB is GONE from the Senate. He’s totally corrupt and was behind a lot of the public land grab in Utah  of national monuments for big oil and mining interests. He’s also become just plain rude and nasty, although he kisses Trump’s ass.
296 2018-09-29 23:14:55 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
297 2018-09-29 23:14:44 Oil Man is an alternate universe version of  Skull Man and was never seen again!
298 2018-09-29 23:14:42 Not done properly it doesn’t.  So, coal is good, Russian & Qatari gas is good then but shale in the north with potentially as big a bonanza than North Sea oil for working people is bad cos Jeremy says so. Is that the English irony Jeremy is so keen on? 
299 2018-09-29 23:14:17 bio oil is multipurpose too so even if you don’t end up using it for that you’ll find another use for it
300 2018-09-29 23:14:17 Omg this pm is such a snake oil salesman  #insiders
301 2018-09-29 23:14:14 Been tryna make do with coconut oil
302 2018-09-29 23:14:13 Not a rush fan and don’t listen to jones.  Beto is far left and financed by Soros who destroys economies while earning billions for the destruction.  Look him up. We were in Brazil when he went down there with oil investments. Long story there.
303 2018-09-29 23:14:09 Ross said “once the bitch need a oil change, I go and buy a new one because I’m spoiled mane”
304 2018-09-29 23:13:58 Someone at the SEC is being paid by oil companies for this witch-hunt on Elon Musk and #Tesla.
305 2018-09-29 23:13:52 For someone, showing acts of kindness/service is showing you love her.. for others, it's words of affirmation.. actually having your partner hear it. Others spending quality time, etc
306 2018-09-29 23:13:44 Look up royalties paid by US oil companies to Canada. Was around $7 a barrel now it's about $8. World price $70 and may go to $100. 4 million barrels a day are stolen. Do the math. Around $250 million a day profit in the pocket of oil billionaires to pay for their gold toylets.
307 2018-09-29 23:13:37 We have the same issue with our guy.  We have completely cut chicken out of his diet and it helps.  However, a lot of dog food has chicken meal, even if it isn’t the primary protein.  We have also started giving him CBD oil made by Boss CBD.
308 2018-09-29 23:13:34 Gotta go back to the beach tomorrow and not only have I not packed, I still have to do laundry, wash my car, get my oil changed, see some family, finish 3 weeks of homework, study for 3 exams, AND make sure all my ducks are in a row to start class again. Love this for me.
309 2018-09-29 23:13:07 And once and for all last August had an independent trial of OTC fish oil from 15k patients and it did nothing. Enough said. I’ve been hearing this crap for 6 years.
310 2018-09-29 23:13:06 What’s an oil change
311 2018-09-29 23:12:52 Alberta has carried this country with transfer payments for the last 25 years. Where has BC been? Quebec? Both provinces screwing us over while Arab oil comes into Quebec 24/7 on tankers.  This is horseshit.
312 2018-09-29 23:12:39 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning, 1/4 c olive oil, 1/8 tsp salt and pepper, 4 TB softened butter, minced fresh garlic cloves: 2 large or 3 small. You can leave out the Italian seasoning if you are putting it in something else with other seasoning....
313 2018-09-29 23:12:16 I do have this feeling that all the while Hurricane Kavanaugh rolled into town, our hero Robert Mueller is burning the midnight oil on @realDonaldTrump. Donnie knows his days are numbered. I mean that press con, what was that? And China likes his 'big big brain'??? Losing it....
314 2018-09-29 23:12:03 Harm herself??... Feeling insecure about her body especially when it's not a health risk isn't harmful enough?. The situations differ but giving words of affirmation at the point is being supportive, not being deceptive. Mind you, everyone has individual love languages.
315 2018-09-29 23:12:00 Go back to hot oil on nuts for a few weeks
316 2018-09-29 23:11:36 Stuck olbas oil up my nose and it burns

322 2018-09-29 23:10:22 Where the oil ?
323 2018-09-29 23:10:21 Ingredients : Garden eggs , groundnut oil, pepper, salt, seasoning cubes. Crayfish or fish (optional). Slice the garden eggs , cook and mash it well.  Then prepare like pepper sauce but your garden egg goes in last

325 2018-09-29 23:10:05 Absolutely. Your only chore is watching the dodgers and using your oil magic to strengthen the bullpen. Now watch our boyfriends and if we win I’ll take you out for McDonalds.
326 2018-09-29 23:10:04 Maybe an oil rig, but I thought those were higher.
327 2018-09-29 23:10:04 Great! Oil of peppermint I have.
328 2018-09-29 23:09:24 5)Avo Oil also works as a natural sunscreen! YES! The oil will help to protect your skin from the harmful UVA and UVB rays and will repair damage caused to skin by spending too long in the sun!
329 2018-09-29 23:09:17 Seems to be working better than an imaginary red line an pallets of cash and giving oil and food someone tried those things Hmm didn’t work so well
330 2018-09-29 23:09:16 Gotta cook em for longer and on low heat so the water evaporates! Without oil at first then when they're mostly cooked put oil and then up da heat 
331 2018-09-29 23:09:09 4)Avocado oil works as an awesome makeup remover. Use it to remove that sticky mascara that just won’t wash away!
332 2018-09-29 23:09:08 Sickening
333 2018-09-29 23:08:55 3)It is an AMAZING hair moisturizer. What I do is a mix an avocado, some olive oil and an egg, then I apply it to my hair for 20 mins and FEEL THE MAGIC .
334 2018-09-29 23:08:50 You are discussing an extremely rare procedure that is managed between a distraught patient and specialist doctor. What other life issues do you feel this engaged with? Climate Change? Death Penalty? Meat eating? Oil wars?
335 2018-09-29 23:08:41 Dawg who tf gonna drink hot oil?
336 2018-09-29 23:08:36 How is it ? I’m a combination of dry to oil skin 
337 2018-09-29 23:08:31 upon waking
you, a fool: coffee
I, clever, inspired: chicken noodle soup with chopped kimchi and chili garlic oil
338 2018-09-29 23:08:17 Why are you being so negative? $5.5 can buy many things in developing countries like food, education, electricity, health, housing etc. $1.9 is the poverty line and not $5.5. So stop calling Nigeria poor country. Your country is oil rich but the politicians are corrupt.
339 2018-09-29 23:08:08 No way he is going to vote yes.
340 2018-09-29 23:08:00 What's the bet the "independent directors" are oil/banking cartel henchmen.
341 2018-09-29 23:07:57 But then again, it comes down to her motives... If it's driven by wanting to feel better about herself or being healthier..  as long as it's not born out of insecurity drawn from comparison. I'd support her on her journey, where ever it leads.
342 2018-09-29 23:07:48 I sat all day in the hospital for some shit that I could’ve just taken some tylenol and hit the oil pen for. They didn’t even send me home with nothin
343 2018-09-29 23:07:35 That is a humanitarian cause. How else would you be able to get gas for your car regularly at fair price even in #Ethiopia, if the oil routes weren't protected by the US to begin with?

Pirates? Rebels? Rogue rulers? Think about it.
344 2018-09-29 23:07:17  the spray &amp; oil rub now those , A1 
345 2018-09-29 23:07:17 @realDonaldTrump oil prices way too high before midterms, show us you care about American consumers and not fighting Iran!
346 2018-09-29 23:07:09 Children of the Living God it's time to burn the Midnight Oil it's time to seek God's face everybody pick an hour out of 24 and if you can play a half hour but God open the door now it's time for the children of God to show all God off is perfect life is a minefield people man
347 2018-09-29 23:06:54 Ah, since it is BK and the Repugs that refused to let the FBI investigate, oil t appears to everyone that it's the right that isn't about truth and justice. Just power...always power.
348 2018-09-29 23:06:44 Not likely since there seems to have been a statute of limitations in 82.
Further there is a reason why they have not. It would likely not be investigated and that fact would discredit the claim further.
349 2018-09-29 23:06:43 I’m a fan of olive oil in my hair & face. Only thing I’ve needed for decades!
350 2018-09-29 23:06:27 My mom said my sister’s headscarf stinks. My sister said it doesn’t because she uses black castor oil. My mom said well you need to switch to white. 
351 2018-09-29 23:06:10 #SEC lurking for any opportunity to take on #tesla and #elonmusk and help big oil and gas. Well done.
352 2018-09-29 23:06:08 Hope the commercial will be bob putz drinking crude oil from a barrel

Llevaste flota low oil o solo fuiste con lo mas rapido para llegar a su nodo?
359 2018-09-29 23:04:43 He led with an insult and attempts to discredit statistics with an obscure and irrelevant reference on oil trade allocation without explanation.

Length of experience does not make the statement any more credible.

363 2018-09-29 23:04:02 Recovering from a cold (on top of this disastrous week) with a commitment-free weekend. Been bingeing BBC's "The Repair Shop" and reality cleaning shows while drafting up #Inktober2018 illustrations.  Oh, and two baths! With bath oil!
364 2018-09-29 23:03:31 It’s so simple.........THE USA WANTS TO ACQUIRE THE BIGGEST OIL RESERVES ON THE PLANET! Simple orchestrated overthrow by any means. It’s what the CIA was made for.

368 2018-09-29 23:02:53 There were in 82. Sorry
369 2018-09-29 23:02:48 What I feel is this, if her complain is born out of insecurity and not primarily out of concern for her health, I opine telling her I love and appreciate her as she is isn't me claiming a form of ownership over her body but instead helping her reinforce confidence in herself.
370 2018-09-29 23:02:42 I bought a new carry on just for stroopwaffles and olive oil. 
371 2018-09-29 23:02:27 Interesting point on the schedule, Rob. I didn't realize it was so heavy up front.
372 2018-09-29 23:02:25 I liked Bouchard today. Not super noticeable, but he made himself available on a few plays. Something not a lot of the oil defense do. Looked very confident.
373 2018-09-29 23:02:18 That's why she has attorneys.
They are not out to discredit or exonerate either side.
They also won't be asking about the devils triangle, the meaning of boofed or validating calendar/yearbook. Sorry
374 2018-09-29 23:02:12 @JoelDTD hey, I remember a few months ago you were wondering about cbd oil. Actually I was wondering if you did tried it? Ive heard you can’t get high but does the mind thoughts changed? I have anxiety and depression and they wanna put me on meds but I don’t want to.
375 2018-09-29 23:01:30 Someone said 70% of new businesses don’t survive the first 2years or is it that these business models are the ones susceptible to post 2015 or am I not reading write? Was it not the same period oil companies downsized world over? Or is there a certain info I’m missing here?

402 2018-09-29 22:56:07 I don't smoke or vape at all, I use CBD oil for joint - no pun intended - pain.

I'm down for trying new edibles!
403 2018-09-29 22:55:58 Canada is a vassal state to the USA, they would be better off as an actual state.  Did you know under #NAFTA they are obliged to supply 75% of its oil and 50% of its natural gas to the USA. They have no say in many of the regulations but have to live with it.
404 2018-09-29 22:55:31 Got one for my wife. I was skeptical. But I bit the bullet and we got one. Traded in her car, got a lower payment$100/mo. No fuel$400/mo. No oil change$300/yr. ins, cheaper, no noticeable difference in our electric bill. Faster than Mustang. It’s a focus. Color me impressed
405 2018-09-29 22:55:29 Yes. You know, like the oil industry
406 2018-09-29 22:54:58 I guess you love high taxes 50% to start. Medicare for all. 10.00 tax on texas oil. No guns for hunting or protection. From a man who tried to flee an accident and lied about it.
407 2018-09-29 22:54:48 This me lol somebody have to come wash it for me , change the oil , look at my tire pressure EVERYTHING! lol
408 2018-09-29 22:54:47 Exactly! I always make it "plain" but with care and good ingredients: good olive oil, good lemons from the neighbor's tree, and homemade tahini, and it's already overwhelmingly flavorful
409 2018-09-29 22:54:44 Are you aware of any analysis on something like a declining cap on the permitted amount of oil a new pipeline could carry? As in, on opening day it can replace what’s moved by rail, then must transport less each year in lockstep with our international emissions obligations?
410 2018-09-29 22:54:42 That Ford has been rode hard and put up wet. Last legs. Time to retire.  Done. 300,000 mile oil change complete. Conclusion, blown head gasket.
411 2018-09-29 22:54:38 McKenzie, We are in the Dark Ages NOW, the Liberals have destroyed Canadian oil, shipping, and have gone into debt so far that your kids, and your grandchildren will carry the burden of paying it off.
412 2018-09-29 22:54:27 It is serious. For everyone. I didnt even say its not. I said its not that deep cause i was tryin to go lateral and say lets talk. Youre diggin where i wasnt even pointin at and sayin you struck hypocrite oil like come tf on 
413 2018-09-29 22:53:46 "bichamin, is made from fragmenting crude u separate it using boiling water,, it separates into its constitute parts, apoxy is translucent, the harderner is slitly above in the fragmentation, u basically destill it, like wine but that thick oil  from places like Afghanistan"
414 2018-09-29 22:53:30 You have to be willing to use more oil than you normally would, and certain dishes just don’t work in them. I did two different curries in my All-Clad pans tonight, with no sticking. It just takes some practice. For everyday nonstick, I use Mauviel carbon steel.

428 2018-09-29 22:51:47 Basically everything in Australia can kill you, and not just the scary looking stuff. Cuddly Kangaroo? Don't get kicked. Adorable koala? She'll slash your face open. That pretty shell on the beach? Lethal sting. Delicious mango tree? Oozes same oil as poison ivy in its sap.
429 2018-09-29 22:51:46 Gulf oil colors, but I’m in on those blue ones pictured
430 2018-09-29 22:51:33 When Earth's oil runs out, I guess I had no choice in the matter
431 2018-09-29 22:51:32 I’m glad that you were able to wade into this one, Kev.

Is that a pint once mixed, or just oil?

Baked brussel sprouts w/ olive oil, salt, & garlic?
433 2018-09-29 22:51:01 Una cosa no quita la otra. Pero tampoco olvidemos que el FMI presta a un tercio de lo que prestaba Venezuela, qué también ponía condiciones jodidas (cómprenme mi Fuel Oil a precios de oro líquido).
434 2018-09-29 22:50:53 Is me one willing to tek all the shit KFC employees throw my way for fear of at the very most a hot oil bath, or at the very least some extra herbs and spices courtesy of the servers...
435 2018-09-29 22:50:51 Sanctions aren't the only thing influencing crude oil prices. Donald seems to have an intimate relationship with Saudi Arabia.
436 2018-09-29 22:50:45 Yeah a car is great and all, until registration, insurance, oil change, and tires come into the picture. Fml. I need to save up to get new tires.
437 2018-09-29 22:50:17 Mammy water is using you to do spin the bottle. Better go and buy anointing oil.

439 2018-09-29 22:50:15 Breaking: 10 minutes ago, Curiosity detects presence of oil on the red planet. 5 minutes ago, U.S. declares war on Mars.
440 2018-09-29 22:49:56 I don’t understand?  Why do we need to buy outside oil from other countries?

442 2018-09-29 22:49:39 Troll? Logically it makes no sense to complain about oil sands not being reclaimed when a) they are b) Ag destroys more land and habitat then 1000 oil sands combined. You moved the goal post when you changed the argument oil sands reclamation to old well site reclamation.
443 2018-09-29 22:49:38 roasted Brussels sprouts with a lot of salt and olive oil are nature's movie theatre popcorn. I will not be silenced

450 2018-09-29 22:48:29 Saw a post on hair, self-hate, and colorism.  I want to be clear about why I flat iron my hair and don't wear the natural curl.  I have some sort of scalp eczema and any products make it worse.  I straighten it and have to wear a prescription oil.  Get my hair done once a week.

476 2018-09-29 22:44:01 Your oil and gas production is impressive! I guess where I am going is when the value associated with such a field is eroded and they are still put up for acquisition as an "asset".considering that the word "asset" is supposed to be valuable
477 2018-09-29 22:43:58 Like you give a shit about Tesla or have any idea about what they’re doing. Big Oil scored a huge victory via their puppet government today. Detractors like you are complicit.

488 2018-09-29 22:41:48 I was once accused of "peeping through the windows" of a house I had rented to a woman and her family, when in fact all I was doing was cleaning up the oil their vehicles had leaked onto my driveway.

The conversation with the police officer was interesting to say the least.
489 2018-09-29 22:41:42 Nah! I run on corn oil! I’m an efficient machine! And no poo for me, just the occasional leak when I can’t stop laughing. 
490 2018-09-29 22:41:41 I just be trying to figure out how mfs all the way in Chicago knoww I need a oil change, sending me emails and shit

492 2018-09-29 22:41:20 Maybe the usa wants to spread Russian defences in broader regions. The usa is on its knees with the petrodollar and the price of oil. Thus the world is beginning to see the usa as the terrorist it is. The usa is a warmonger i hope it does not draw the eu into it. Uk kises us ass.

503 2018-09-29 22:38:54 Is all the flak on @elonmusk warranted? Or is the threat of the #Tesla brand against the oil status-quo a lot bigger than the in-media representations he gives?
504 2018-09-29 22:38:52 The capitalists deceive us into believing that they have rights to land, oil and other concessions.

518 2018-09-29 22:36:25 Even if you deny climate change (or the effects of climate change) there are still a ton of political/societal/financial/moral reasons to heavily invest in renewables and get off big oil ASAP.
519 2018-09-29 22:36:03 Oh you think you'll get oil well in pH abi see you. You think you're smart
520 2018-09-29 22:35:57 Yessss fight oil with oil! It’s the only way to replenish your skin or you’ll just keep up the cycle of stripping your skin and then getting extra oily to over compensate

550 2018-09-29 22:31:50 The oil is the taste
551 2018-09-29 22:31:47 It was first created as an industrial oil
It smells rank growing in the fields
It tastes rank
When sold as canola oil it is partially hydrogenated
When you heat it up it cracks and gives off a terrible pong
It has a compound called erucic acid which is harmful to the heart
552 2018-09-29 22:31:31 Let them. All their manners of getting to us are unhealthy and noxious and this is really a gutter standard.
Thank god, the liberation has begun.

577 2018-09-29 22:25:40 The automakers are small potatoes. Think bigger. Think oil markets. Also think of the contractors that stand to lose trillions when oil wars dry up.

580 2018-09-29 22:24:56 Actually price w/o tax was Rs 62 three months ago and world oil price has increase since then so taxes are around 40% which is less than 52%

582 2018-09-29 22:24:48 Printing money came after the supply side collapse, feel free to read through their economic history, particularly 1997 through to 2005. 

Venezuela had multiple failures in policy, lack of diversification and reliance on oil prices no doubt, but also amassed huge foreign debts.
583 2018-09-29 22:24:46 Car was fine. Took it to Jiffy Lube for an oil change. They claim my brake pads are gone. "It's metal on metal. Haven't you noticed the grinding?'

Nope.

Refuse the outrageous price to replace them. Drive away. Horrendous grinding now.
584 2018-09-29 22:24:41 It's a Ford 6.0 engine. They're notorious for the poor oil cooler, failing injectors and failing head gaskets ... check two out of three on my truck. It's a huge job and I'm facing some big decisions and maybe an extended stay in the Twin Cities.

589 2018-09-29 22:24:13 1) I spent my summers reclaiming old wells in northern Alberta the cost to the oil company: $25 000 a day. Spare me the “research” lecture. If the rules on reclamation wheren’t so ridiculous, strict, and inefficient there would be 10x the wells reclaimed annually.

593 2018-09-29 22:23:00 I think what we need is a decentralised minimum wage. Let the parastatal, agencies, ministries and state govt agree on what is payable. Why should the minimum wage in Kebi, Adamawa, Gombe states be same with Lagos, and oil rich states? It's not sustainable.

630 2018-09-29 22:17:53 Canada has vast amounts of oil and NG reserves. It's imperative we capitalize on these resources by building infastructure to ship these products internationally while they are in demand.

Seems stakeholders more open now but we’re 10 yrs behind - maybe we were too oil focused to create what we needed to help us through rougher times. We didn’t get out ahead, so now the race is far harder.

For acids I'll use rice wine or balsamic vinegar, or lime juice. For sweeteners honey or sriracha.
660 2018-09-29 22:12:11 The insiders who work in the oil industry are respected engineers and technologists and are tied up with technical, operational and safety management.

714 2018-09-29 22:04:22 Elon. You did it. You accelerated the world to a sustainable transportation. Now it’s time to take that acceleration to full speed and kill big oil. Kill the ICE engine and make America the innovative blessing in all of this. I will be forever a loyal @tesla fan.

718 2018-09-29 22:04:13 Weird. Mood has gotten slightly better since stopping the fish oil because it was bothering my stomach. I should be suicidal given the amount of pain I am in but I am not. I still want to die but it isn't strong. I only took the fish oil v/c it was to help with mood. Odd

725 2018-09-29 22:02:41 And will lead the charge as we did with coal right up until we run out. Meanwhile the rest of the world will lead on renewables. We won’t be able to steal their wind and solar like we have with oil.
726 2018-09-29 22:02:20 And who are those special interests? Big Pharma, Big Oil, Big Everything. Rich people who can afford lobbyists and influence through donations, if not downright graft. 
I'd like to know how many rich folks give out of the goodness of their hearts rather than for tax deductions.

736 2018-09-29 22:00:34 The crudeness of the oil impacted on the brain of the rulers
737 2018-09-29 22:00:23 We can tell that by the oil slick on Trump’s skin.

740 2018-09-29 22:00:16 You know who else can pay lobbyists a lot of money?  The Auto Industry.   I also thought I read about how Alberta Oil & Gas is being vilified by special interest groups.

744 2018-09-29 21:59:49 First time i hear about that! Need to google how it works, bacause if the foundation is oil based, shouldnt it slip? And if the foundation is water based, wouldnt it dilute it?
745 2018-09-29 21:59:38 y’all literally only love/appreciate dark skin women when they’re either with a celebrity, thick af or in a picture with hella oil... FOH  it’s annoying
746 2018-09-29 21:59:35 OPEC controller the price of oil! Trump is trying to force them to lower the price.

750 2018-09-29 21:59:12 They were willing to grant no wrong dooing, for a pittance and musk gone. But if he stays what he did was wrong. They want him gone because his company with him at the wheel is too threatening to the auto and oil boys.
751 2018-09-29 21:59:12 Might be a bit like turning an oil tanker around but it needs to happen & happen sooner rather later. 
752 2018-09-29 21:59:11 Watching nappily ever after this man walks around with sweet almond oil just to kiss it into her skin...ok ma'am
753 2018-09-29 21:59:07 That sounds really nice. Better than the castor oil I was fed at boarding school!
754 2018-09-29 21:58:10 Jajajajajaja nooooooo.... te quiero con botas de goma y las manos embarradas con  2-cycles oil ... 
755 2018-09-29 21:57:36 Lucas oil field has the scanners outside as well. At least they did for the taylor swift concert a few weeks ago. There were like 50k people outside, but took my wife and daughter 5 min to get through the line and into the stadium. It was impressive.

757 2018-09-29 21:57:09 The counter would be "so what". What about every other interaction we have in crises or tricky situations around the hospital in the management suite, wherever. This is snake oil and I think it stinks of sanctimony.
758 2018-09-29 21:56:55 Where is my oil! It's a bunch on Harry Potter folk walking around with witche's spell sticks on Granby St. 

759 2018-09-29 21:56:44 Jesus stop by jiffy lube on your way home and get your oil changed.
760 2018-09-29 21:56:42 That’s the only shit they can run, your two bit traveling snake oil show.
761 2018-09-29 21:56:18 The misinformation that is told with half truths on electric cars is wrong. They still use hazardous chemicals to create them & are in the new stages. Electricity still uses oil in transformers. Solar panels are made with toxic chemicals. Naïve consumerism in the making...
762 2018-09-29 21:56:18 Agree with all that you say but not about education, as someone in this field, would not contribute to ‘British’ history. 
In talk other day pupil said oil running out, this comes from MSM, parents. If people believe msm lies, it’s hard to change thinking.

765 2018-09-29 21:56:08 I’m fed up of passing on messages. Somewhere there are really experienced gas plumbers who have done as many radiator extensions as they can cope with. You’re needed on gas pipelines and at the oil refineries.

769 2018-09-29 21:55:15 Norway (just to put an example) has a minimum wage of $20-$25. Do you wanna know what the middle class makes there? I think you’re the one that should do some research. But yeah keep aiming for shitty $7.50 + tips jobs. Let’s not even talk about their gas & oil reserves.
770 2018-09-29 21:54:28 Well I said that back in July and what has started to happen oil is going up.did not mean to call you baby..not my style...plus you like Trump and cubic zaconia and tassel so that says everything I need to know about you..lol

783 2018-09-29 21:52:34 Avoid using water to dilute an essential oil, and be skeptical of any seller suggesting it’s okay. Water actually increases an oil’s strength in most cases!

804 2018-09-29 21:50:08 Was it stalling before it gave up?  Any oil consumption problems?
805 2018-09-29 21:50:04 I do understand. But the great thing abt our bodies is that every cell regenerates every seven years. With the right nutrients to target a particular system, over time it can strengthen & actually repair but its not an overnight process. 

CBD oil can help repair it faster.

821 2018-09-29 21:47:35 I've looked at both. We must replace oil end of story. I'm sure we will find a much more environmental friendly way of storing electricity in the future. If you insist on cyclical arguments just move on.
822 2018-09-29 21:47:30 damn i lost my train of thought - i was either going to do something, doing something, or just finished doing something
also i got hot oil in my eye while frying burgers earlier and it still hurts
823 2018-09-29 21:47:17 Cannabombz is really good if you haven't tried them.  CBD oil is not all the same even at the same mg.
824 2018-09-29 21:47:10 Mr. DETECTFOOL followers does not translate to supporters. Can someone borrow this man a brain @oil_shaeikh. Done with you already. Next time don't make a claim you can't substantiate. You are a big fool.
825 2018-09-29 21:47:07 I hate peeling and mincing garlic as much as the next clown with a chef’s knife but I gotta say, if you use that pre-minced garbage that comes swimming in oil under a screw top lid, you really don’t deserve to use garlic at all bro.

866 2018-09-29 21:42:17 Our "ally" Saudi Arabia only supports global terrorism, abuses women, and commits genocide in Yemen. And BTW, Iran wouldn't even be under Ayatollahs if Our CIA hadn't overthrown a peaceful, democratic govt there so BP could get cheap oil.

869 2018-09-29 21:41:33 Nice! Do you have time to teach 2 six grade girls oil painting, once a week? We live in Loma Linda. Thanks, David 2132683616
870 2018-09-29 21:41:18 You truly only will listen to someone who agrees with you...what the fuk do you know about oil production that this person doesn’t know after 23 years working in the oil industry? Don’t be so arrogant man 
871 2018-09-29 21:41:16 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
872 2018-09-29 21:41:16 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Pittsburgh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

884 2018-09-29 21:39:41 Is it just me or does it feel like there's some kind of a shady agenda by western countries to shove the whole gay narrative down our throats here in Africa? If they have a problem with 'Gay Rights', then they can start with their middle-eastern oil buddies. Good place to start.
885 2018-09-29 21:39:29 In my opinion coconut oil is the best makeup remover

892 2018-09-29 21:38:38 I tried to make a pretty facial mask with pink Himalayan salt and pink scented rose water... but the green clay just made it mud colored & the vitamin e oil cancelled out the smell.  my failures are funny until I get fed up with my own bullshit.

897 2018-09-29 21:36:44 So what about the Russian Oligarchs and Putin where much of that finance is being subverted to- Remember Oil was the main driver but Russian industry and its political budgets are very deceptive especially since Putin can report anything it wants to on his state media system
898 2018-09-29 21:36:29 At present, banks lending less to private as GoK is borrowing locally BIGtime after cap law,; petrol stations mushrooming due finance bill afew years back giving each oil marketer target if 50 outlets within a set deadline..

909 2018-09-29 21:34:14 The state-owned Syrian Petroleum Corporation (SPC) lost 252 million barrels of oil in potential production since the start of the war. Prior to 2011, SPC entered into several production sharing agreements with international oil companies such as Shell, Total, Petro-Canada, etc.

913 2018-09-29 21:33:42 well this was mainly to the new vegan mother and her son, but I’ll go ahead anyway. look into the Whole Foods Plant Based diet for optimal health. refined grains, all oils (including olive oil), and processed food like sugar can be very damaging. eat beans!! lol

920 2018-09-29 21:33:21 I make the best aioli.

Egg yolks, saffron, garlic, lemon juice, mustard (not grain), and slowly add olive oil as it blends to keep it from curdling. If it curdles, teaspoon of cold water.

925 2018-09-29 21:32:59 Why would any American not be able to see that you’re just speaking for big oil companies?
926 2018-09-29 21:32:54 New favorite essential oil combo for a clear & peaceful mind? 9 drops #lavender, 1 drop #peppermint in the diffuser.
927 2018-09-29 21:32:43 Stop trying to force your essential oil cult crap on everyone. Sincerely, everyone who doesn’t want your essential oils cult crap. #thanks
928 2018-09-29 21:32:40 It was excellent! Never knew that whaling wad such an important industry before crude oil production/refinement. Also to learn that sperm whales strategically struck ships and that there are real, white colored Mocha/Moby dicks swimming in the oceans 
929 2018-09-29 21:32:25 Trump is president Trump appointed Scott Pruitt to the EPA the EPA was raped by Scott and Trump now Trump installs another oil tycoon as people are poison to buy a toxic water and Scott Pruitt is not in jail & Trump is not in jail only in America
930 2018-09-29 21:32:18 Also, if you don't, frequently massaging your scalp will help spread the oil around and loosen the dead skin that could be helping to hold the oil in your follicles.
931 2018-09-29 21:32:13 @OlaySkin do u sell Oil of Olay Complete Broad Spectrum Sunscreen 30, Sensitive Skin (it has a yellow top) in Italy? If yes, where (a list would b great). If no, is there an online authorized distributor? & does European version contain the same ingredients as USA version?
932 2018-09-29 21:31:51 CBD oil has been a huge help with my anxiety.
933 2018-09-29 21:31:36 Hemp oil is great
934 2018-09-29 21:31:35 When they ask me what oil do I want for my car...  Sir isn't your job to know 
935 2018-09-29 21:31:31 We have increased oil production, but the US economy has been less oil dependent, consuming and importing less than at our early-2000s peak even as the population skyrockets from mass immigration.
936 2018-09-29 21:31:25 Olbas Oil is my die hard go to every time 
937 2018-09-29 21:31:22 In all fairness, a power plant is a heck of a lot more efficient than 1,000s of small combustion engines dripping oil and smoking up the streets. Not saying $TSLA is the only answer, but EVs are the future for most applications without a doubt.
938 2018-09-29 21:31:01 You mean the oil that you stole from Iraq.
939 2018-09-29 21:30:49 The guy thats changing my oil  Ha'u angeeee 
940 2018-09-29 21:30:47 Yeah, you may need more frequent washing or less oil applications or even decrease the amount of oil per application. I do a deep wash maybe once a month but do a coach or light and quick lathering wash once a week...
941 2018-09-29 21:30:31 Какой ты у меня каламбурщик
942 2018-09-29 21:30:17 おはよう。二度寝したら追いオリーブだぞ。
943 2018-09-29 21:30:00 Drink some apple cider vinegar and just continue drinking water throughout the day, stay away from foods with oil and wash yuh face 
944 2018-09-29 21:29:55 Actually, we have an aerobic septic system; a woman works on/inspects it. We have a lady who maintains our porta potty at my husband's shop & one who works on our clothes dryer. I also help my husband wire electrical control boxes for an item he makes for the oil/gas industry .
945 2018-09-29 21:29:51 I’ve always had bad ears. Did you dry warming up some olive oil  on a cotton swab and drizzling it into your ear?
946 2018-09-29 21:29:32 Neoliberalism:

'90: Sure, rich states are responsible & should help poor with tech transfer, & focus on warming mitigation.

'00: We should focus on adaptation. Tech what now? Also, about these targets..

'10: What about China? We've got all this oil now..

'18: Fuck all of you.

948 2018-09-29 21:28:50 Also they are too dumb to know that Venezuela's economic problems were brought on my putting all their economic eggs in one basket, the OIL basket. And when prices tanked..
949 2018-09-29 21:28:33 If it is not immediately or a few hours or day after applying oil, then it is just that you have too much oil accumulated on the scalp and need to wash your scalp to let your follicles breathe.

It's 2018
We should be the largest producer of Solar, Wind, Hydro & other energies & should have started dropping oil & coal 25+ yrs ago.
Congrats on the achievements through passive aggressive  manipulation. Take a look at your atmospheres.
953 2018-09-29 21:27:53 In my case, the proportions were 2/3c vinegar, 3 shallots cut super thin, 5 Tbsp mustard (2 regular dijon, 2 stone ground dijon, 1 whole grain), and slowly whisked in 1/2 c olive oil (similar to making mayo).
954 2018-09-29 21:27:49 Who said anything about oil. Look at fuel cells before you talk to me about oil.
955 2018-09-29 21:27:47 CBD oil edge break
956 2018-09-29 21:27:30 Mr. DETECTFOOL all I am asking you to do is to substantiate your claim. Perhaps it was your fucking destitute families. Loool.
957 2018-09-29 21:27:19 It's a circle, it never ends.  You lost relatives who were killed,  they lost relatives too and probably revenged. 

Let the cycle of revenge continue and we'll all see if casualties don't pill up. 

An eye for an eye,  soon the whole world will be blind.
958 2018-09-29 21:27:04 I'll take lithium battery production over oil consumption 10 out of 10 times. I'm not I'll informed either. My father helped clean up the Exxon Valdez oil spill in March of 1989. You have no idea the real impact of oil until you have witnessed this type of tragedy.
959 2018-09-29 21:26:58 It took me too long to realize this but you can call #python async/await functions from a #django management command. Web scraping is smooth as tractor oil now!
960 2018-09-29 21:26:57 I really just got coconut oil on my dress  I hope it comes out
961 2018-09-29 21:26:39 I have folliculitus, so my scalp is sensitive. If I don't wash my hair enough or if my scalp is too oily or too dry, I will have pimples in my scalp and it will bleed. Too much oil makes me flake too and the excessive oil is irritating but is if I can't wash my hair after a month
962 2018-09-29 21:26:36 Fried in what???? Olive oil???  
963 2018-09-29 21:26:15 Oil is pollution, oil is plastic, plastic is pollution
964 2018-09-29 21:26:11 Awesome!  It really is better we in America produce our own oil.
965 2018-09-29 21:26:07 Coconut oil makes my skin happy
966 2018-09-29 21:26:04 Yes. We use ours a lot. Heavy oil and proper seasoning and you will not regret it.

969 2018-09-29 21:25:53 Y’all I’ve been vaping with CBD oil and if you suffer from any type of anxiety please look into it . It’s only been 3 days and I’m already seeing a difference.

980 2018-09-29 21:23:10 I have drunk an excessive amount of orange juice today. What’s vapo rub? I’m currently making my whole room smell like olbas oil...

982 2018-09-29 21:23:06 I see why the 500 women of the community came out to protest evacuating water from d pond.

991 2018-09-29 21:21:25 An emulsion of shallots soaked in cider vinegar, mustard, olive oil, and a bit of potato starch to stabilize it.
992 2018-09-29 21:21:22 I would suggest to you the documentary "Merchants of Doubt."

I would also suggest the Guardian article from a few days ago revealing the internal papers of the oil companies showing models due to their behavior that lead us directly to today.
993 2018-09-29 21:21:12 Yea but we're;

1001 2018-09-29 21:19:26 Bought groceries, fall decorations for my apartment, and gas all this week, and I still need an oil change.. I think I’m tapped out for a while lol
1002 2018-09-29 21:19:01 Sometimes the oil can make your scalp itch due to it being more than what your skin can absorb, it could be loosening the dead skin, it could be too heavy and need to be washed out after a few days to avoid it clogging your follicles
Lightly adding oil to just your hair may help
1003 2018-09-29 21:19:00 Rosemary essential oil is good for headaches

1007 2018-09-29 21:18:39 Han Han.  All these coconut oil,  Shea butter and cocoa butter kinikan works sha.
1008 2018-09-29 21:18:36 Um, why did no one tell me about lip oil before now? That shit's amazing.

1010 2018-09-29 21:17:49 It's not the CIA. It's the Patent Office. Any patent application that infringes on current gas/oil/coal powers is given a special designation that routes it down a hole where it is never seen from again.
1011 2018-09-29 21:17:45 ‘But I’m mainly trying to sell off our public lands to oil companies and poison the air, land and water with my fellow eco-criminals, Trump & Zinke’
1012 2018-09-29 21:17:32 Thanks, Irish beef, sweet big onions, Black garlic, a jar good quality beef fond, small tin tomato puree. Brown the meat in olive oil and salted butter, add all the rest, at last put the fond in. 3 hours in oven C 100, cut the Portobello in big chunks and put them in last 30 min
1013 2018-09-29 21:17:13 Insane..I guess it’s only Canadian oil and coal mines that effect the environment 
1014 2018-09-29 21:16:33 I am the oil, I fry
1015 2018-09-29 21:16:33 Cool so, turns out I’m allergic to magnesium oil. Tried using it to help w my awful hip pains lately. But now I’m covered in hives. And still aching. And now I’m gonna try n make like 600 for rent due Monday. :)
1016 2018-09-29 21:16:18 Does she realise that Syria has no significant oil reserves?
1017 2018-09-29 21:15:53 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
1018 2018-09-29 21:15:52 Note to self: stop wasting money on food and buy that set of oil paints that you’ve been eyeing for months.
1019 2018-09-29 21:15:40 I wouldn't stoop to your level & start calling you names like you did to me Mr. DETECTFOOL. U can only imagine it in your dreams to get my wears where I got them from. Face the fact, what makes you concluded that it was Biroms that was behind the missing general & not ur family?
1020 2018-09-29 21:15:40 Kavanaugh is also expected to rule FOR big oil in the fight against planet earth. Then Bu$h profit....
1021 2018-09-29 21:15:20 The 'modes of oil Oil comes from "me", I was animated Plato is a love letter with a reinvention of the War on a geopolitical
1022 2018-09-29 21:15:10 I love how people ask for a recommendation then immediately argue with your answer. yeah i’m sure whatever bullshit you read on facebook works much better with your essential oil diffuser so why are you wasting my time?
1023 2018-09-29 21:15:09 We would love to hear from anyone treating epilepsy with CBD oil? #CBDoil #epilepsy

1027 2018-09-29 21:14:39 i went to subway today and thought of u @elicrafra
1028 2018-09-29 21:14:35 Bro, talk with evidence and I don't believe the learned said that. Anyways, you and I believe the price of crude oil at the international market influences our petroleum products price. The fall of the cedi is not as high as the rise in crude oil price per barrel recently. Tnx!
1029 2018-09-29 21:14:20 Cannatol P450, Cannatol THC oil, and HH 15:1 oil.
1030 2018-09-29 21:14:17 At least the great grand kids of big oil will have more than enough inherited wealth to build enormous high-tech structures that will keep them safe during this scorched earth dystopia so that they can repopulate earth full of evil.

1032 2018-09-29 21:13:44 Fulani herdsmen are political herdsmen?  Means the Politicians are responsible for this General's death too,  since we all want to be silly
1033 2018-09-29 21:13:38 I’ve never had breathing problems/ throat pain until @airwickus started their essential oil line. My allergic reactions are insane.
1034 2018-09-29 21:13:30 Yeah at least drizzle some olive oil from a truck stop
1035 2018-09-29 21:13:30 In a world where or is it were? Whatever. The most powerful being in the universe was taken back at the site of TJ Kirk pouring hot oil on his naked hairy man titties. One Christian makes a tweet completely destroying him.
1036 2018-09-29 21:13:29 &neither democrats, nor republicans r weak... they r made from same oil/base.. only politics played create illusion of difference.. a democratic US government can do things like bombing Iraq or Japan with same ease as republicans.. without counting number of ppl getting killed..
1037 2018-09-29 21:13:18 Im eating the flyest form of jacket potato right now.... Baked sweet potato with diced raw red bell pepper and branston baked beans seasoned with a dashing of spices and walnut oil
1038 2018-09-29 21:13:13 Chilling with your friend yet you’re on Twitter replying to me 

But nah yeah I wish I were at my pc but I’m in the garage cleaning up a oil mess on a day off. Dunno how that’s not the real world.
1039 2018-09-29 21:12:57 And remember, a heart disease reversal diet needs to be more than eating whole foods that are plant based. It must also be low in all fats, 10% of calories or less. Extremely small amounts of high fat plant foods like avocado, olives and olive oil. In fact, no oil at all.
1040 2018-09-29 21:12:54 If you want to run, try persistence hunting runners. It is amusing to mog runners by following them for miles, lean, jacked, and shirtless, covered in oil.
1041 2018-09-29 21:12:51 fish oil 
1042 2018-09-29 21:12:46 I hope not!  Humanity already goes to war over land issues and mineral/oil/water rights...I would love for Mars to be "owner free"!!
1043 2018-09-29 21:12:34 Perish under capitalism if you cannot will yourself to look past what you think you know. Capitalism needed slavery. It still does. Low wages. We killed for oil and supplies. Capitalism in the US only improved US. We raped and pillaged and murderer everyone else to get this far.
1044 2018-09-29 21:12:29 Omg yes!! Let me know if you need ideas for mixtures! I also have a really good smelling oil I’ll give ya

1047 2018-09-29 21:12:03 Did you know you can use coconut oil for damn near everything?…
1048 2018-09-29 21:11:56 Hahahah.  Defending justice. Nah!  Remember when rep were the party of obstruction ?  You’re singing a diffeeent tune to the same saint. Except rep are the party of corruption, oil and war.  Oh and sexual assault.  Grab them by the pussy republicans.  The future is female!
1049 2018-09-29 21:11:52 But how many black Americans have been murdered? Do you know their names? While talking of violence against women, at home there's #BlackLivesMatter , or that's irrelevant since you can't sell your weapons and steal oil?
1050 2018-09-29 21:11:48 Hahaha it’s definitely an experience, make sure you pop some Tylenol prior to going, & next time take a shower the night before & exfoliate your bikini area w/ coconut oil. So it won’t be irritation when they wax the next day! #Enjoy
1051 2018-09-29 21:11:16 The CBD oil from Holland&Barrett is controlling my emphysema. It has helped me a lot & when they ran out I went into remission within days. I now have 4 mths stocked up to avoid running out again.
I like your idea re royalties from oil 4 alt energy IF they get as far as fracking.
1052 2018-09-29 21:11:10 In an era of growth for snake oil, guess fish oil was obvious... cgts !
1053 2018-09-29 21:11:08 Me to me: do NOT go blow your paycheck on alcohol. Do not do it. Get an oil change. DO NOT STOP and get your nails done. YOU CAN NOT WAIT FOR THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT.
1054 2018-09-29 21:11:05 Now this is where things get interesting,  back then both the cooking oil and dish soap they used came in the same opaque plastic bottle. Same shape and everything. I preface this with, my incredibly wonderful aunty that I love so much isn't the strongest reader so...
1055 2018-09-29 21:10:55 First, a massive supply chain (engineers, miners, railroad conductors, stevedores, processing plants, etc.), which second, transferred power to “the masses” who could disrupt that supply chain with labor action, sabotage, work slowdowns, etc. Highly vulnerable. Oil is not.
1056 2018-09-29 21:10:42 Today I cried because of an oil change. 

Apparently that’s the kind of person I am when I’ve worked 13 days in a row. 
1057 2018-09-29 21:10:38 There's nowt wrong with olive oil, I always say.
1058 2018-09-29 21:10:09 Crass behavior.  That's upsetting. Oil
I'd want to punch them.
1059 2018-09-29 21:10:05 عاجل / وزاة الداخلية: تعديل موعد إغلاق الطرق بمناسبة زيارة ولي العهد السعودي للبلاد حيث سيبدأ الإغلاق في الساعة 5.30 مساءً.
1060 2018-09-29 21:10:04 I am capitalism and the Arab Revolutions are dangerous because the region is now in a position to export both oil and revolution.
1061 2018-09-29 21:10:04 ああ、これはまずい。実にまずい。0.1トン超えたよ。
1062 2018-09-29 21:09:59 Mind yo business drinks lots of water and get an oil change today 
1063 2018-09-29 21:09:51 Wash the affected area, using African black soap if possible, then apply Colgate toothpaste and Vaseline (assuming you don’t have Tea tree oil), keep on for about 30mins then wash up, apply Vitamin E oil on it after if you have any.
1064 2018-09-29 21:09:34 Reptiles do not perspire, and do not have any oil glands
1065 2018-09-29 21:09:33 I go don fry am with palm oil teytey
1066 2018-09-29 21:09:25 Thanks for not going private. Gas, oil and car industry working to take you down.  Now SEC.  i support @elonmusk @Tesla !  Buying a Tesla. Already own the stock. Fight for zero emission continues thanks to you
1067 2018-09-29 21:09:17 but can you sell a car to oil?
1068 2018-09-29 21:08:49 Yes,political herdsmen ...
1069 2018-09-29 21:08:43 If i break your heart na oil spillage
I study this your love for freedom college 
1070 2018-09-29 21:08:22 In all seriousness, you can use any oily fat in the final step (a traditional German potato salad would use rendered bacon fat), but I use olive oil for various reasons (flavor and convenience).
1071 2018-09-29 21:08:20 YU see dis thing dey call Atagungun, and red oil, is like their champions league
1072 2018-09-29 21:08:16 Yes. Drive a Tesla powered by 93% renewable BC energy.
Yes. I support the end of oil and all its damage human life on this plant. Not to advocate for some BS energy east pipeline that AB wouldn't even care about if they got the other pipelines.
1073 2018-09-29 21:07:55 Made An Appointment For My Oil Change And THE PERSON IS ON VACATION.
If I Don’t Get My Oil Changed Today Ima Fucking Fight A Bitch.
1074 2018-09-29 21:07:34 That would be a problem right enough, but he’ll have an oil for that. And I think we agreed dry was better than clammy anyway?
1075 2018-09-29 21:07:30 Giants answer back and jump out in front of Kershaw & the Dodgers 3-2 in the B3. No way San Francisco plays dead and allows LA to roll them. Been a helluva series to this point.
1076 2018-09-29 21:07:28 Try those bean bags filled with wheat. You can pop them in the microwave for 1-2 mins and apply.  Nice and easy and you can add a couple of essential oil perfume.
I have heard some people had steroid injections into the area but this isn't guaranteed to work, or to last.
1077 2018-09-29 21:07:14 19.  Require citizenship documents to register to vote

20.  Cut welfare and food stamps

21.  More oil and gas drilling/build Keystone pipeline

22.  Expand fracking and burying nuclear waste

23.  No tax on carbon products/re-open coal mining
1078 2018-09-29 21:06:58 When do we stop using food to make fuel? We export oil, don’t need to use food to make ethanol anymore!
1079 2018-09-29 21:06:52 Oilsands aren’t fairly depicted. New extraction techniques will cut emissions 30% from present levels in the next 5 yrs. Coal is a far bigger problem & Vancouver is the largest exporter on the west coast. Ship oil and LNG to Asian markets instead and we’ll all be far better off.
1080 2018-09-29 21:06:50 Castor oil is good and I’ve also been taking biotin and that helps (even though I started taking it bc my hair is falling out, my lashes are longer )
1081 2018-09-29 21:06:47 I wish this would have been available when I was a kid! Great job!
1082 2018-09-29 21:06:41 Misleading to look just at reserves. Venezuela and Canada both have heavy oil and tar sands reserves which are expensive to produce and Saudi’s reserves have always been secretive.

Read with caution.
1083 2018-09-29 21:06:37 Avocado oil is in Thick Body Butter
1084 2018-09-29 21:06:15 And why is that? The oil is in Scottish waters owned by Scotland, not waters owned by Orkney or Shetland. Same with the fish you speak of. Scotland would do fine on its own with or without Shetland and Orkney.
1085 2018-09-29 21:06:12 "How hard is it to mess up eggs?" You might be wondering? Well let's loop back to the buying things in bulk.  She wanted to use sombre cooking oil ("why would you use cooking oil for eggs? is a question that still plagues me to this day")
1086 2018-09-29 21:06:02 Benue *
1087 2018-09-29 21:05:52 Having a car is cool and all but when you hada dish out $2500 on new tyres and oil change you start to tell yourself travelling not that bad enno loll
1088 2018-09-29 21:05:37 I get your point.  Trying to be optimistic.
1089 2018-09-29 21:05:36 Only jailing ALL the people profiting from the current snake oil system may lead to change. Be merciful; 130 years behind bars should do it. Oh, give them the current health"care" system.
1090 2018-09-29 21:05:33 Just like the Fulani herdsmen who kill people in their homes are murderers. 

Thanks for saying I'm stupid,  I hope you are this hurt when the plateau and Venue people are murdered in cold blood by herdsmen. 

They are victims too,  the government has failed to protect them.
1091 2018-09-29 21:05:31 We haven’t defined the relationship. It’s the helicopter presence. Unbelievable. Cheese Maya, cheese oil. Oh my god.
1092 2018-09-29 21:05:27 I should keep breaking in my scooter (it becomes safer to push the speed at 300 miles) but I feel too guilty about burning gasoline and oil. It's also cold and I don't have enough cold weather gear right now.
1093 2018-09-29 21:05:21 Oh wow, just because Superman has to decide he wants to be Superman instead of having it thrust on him, that means he's not Superman. Even before he puts on the costume he is saving people. He saved the kids on the bus, he saves the men on the oil rig.
1094 2018-09-29 21:05:15 NDP apologist defense: "Big Oil made us do it!" Must be depressing for New Democrats to finally gain power, only to have to sell out their values like this.
1095 2018-09-29 21:05:13 We currently spend more than £1500 per person per year more on public services than the rest of the UK. Yet we raise less per person in tax (incl all oil tax revenues).

How would you fill that gap? Service cuts or tax rises?

So yes, skint is appropriate.
1096 2018-09-29 21:05:08 Oh I really hope so...we deserve it. Never stopped believing.
1097 2018-09-29 21:05:05 I hope that's his mid season form. :)
1098 2018-09-29 21:04:58 Norway has a population of about 6 million and an oil fund. 
Switzerland has a land border, not a coastal border.
And they are both in Schengen. But yeah, apart from that, it’ll be exactly like those countries.
1099 2018-09-29 21:04:50 My mom and I hitting my oil pen in the bathroom bc my grandma can be overwhelming sometimes is a whole mood
1100 2018-09-29 21:04:28 (ﾃﾞﾃﾞﾝ!!)日本の夜明け…いや世界の、いや銀河系の夜明けぜよ！！！
1101 2018-09-29 21:04:23 reading an art book the size of a headstone that smells like an oil spill
1102 2018-09-29 21:04:19 So why is the price of oil so high?
1103 2018-09-29 21:04:04 Dont let the Kavanagh case distract you from the fact that the Trump administration has gone back on their stance on climate change and now say it's irreversible so they loosened restrictions on gas and oil companies allowing them to cause even more destruction to the environment
1104 2018-09-29 21:03:52 Then why are our prices the highest in years ? Because America second oil companies first. You let them export our oil and we but expensive OPEC oil.
1105 2018-09-29 21:03:50 Now it’s time to oil it up and see how it finishes! 

(I’ll stop now.)
1106 2018-09-29 21:03:48 I just tried the tea tree oil conditioner from Trader Joe’s and bitchhhhh. My scalp feels amazing
1107 2018-09-29 21:03:47 Oil is old school.
1108 2018-09-29 21:03:28 You need much of that to pump oil or mine copper, too! 

The point is, what if it's not *investment* that matters for the RC, but investment in *human capital* - i.e. in an educated, healthy, happy-ish populace?
1109 2018-09-29 21:03:24 So tell us again why we need to pipe in oil from Canada?
1110 2018-09-29 21:03:14 Cleansing my skin with castor/almond oil combined and using  grapeseed oil as a moisturizer has been the answer to my prayers. And I’m VERY oily.
1111 2018-09-29 21:02:45 Standard Oil and AT&T did not eat the souls of its consumers like Twitter and Facebook and most Social Media do.  So when you log in be aware you are in the matrix, a young one, bsrely learning the ropes, but getting better each day.
1112 2018-09-29 21:02:38 Anyday....anyday....my tax dollars can subsidize green tech over the hand and fist subsidies going to oil.
1113 2018-09-29 21:02:33 Damn how much you paying for an oil change?????
1114 2018-09-29 21:02:21 I feel more like I need a Turkish bath than a shower. The ladies douse you with hot water, soap you up, scrub you with loofah, rinse you with cold water, soothe you with oil and leave you to recover on a heated slab of marble...spotlessly clean and free of the cares of the world.
1115 2018-09-29 21:02:20 Oil or water (DRILLING)?
1116 2018-09-29 21:02:18 Like Pardew he’s a snake oil salesman who’s been found out.
1117 2018-09-29 21:02:12 No. This reeks of politics.
1118 2018-09-29 21:02:02 I do not miss the stress of oil heat and poverty
1119 2018-09-29 21:02:02 Okay.....that 's nice. Now declassify tech, so we can get our asses off oil. Thanks.
1120 2018-09-29 21:01:53 First, I cut onions or shallots super thin. Then, soak them in som vinegar (I used apple cider vinegar this time). Put in your other item (mustard this time, horseradish next time) and whisk. After it's whisked together, add olive oil and whisk it in.
1121 2018-09-29 21:01:52 The capitalists rob the planet, rip it open for oil and gold, and leave us with nothing but labor.
1122 2018-09-29 21:01:47 He also cleaned it and did an oil change and put new tires on my car. All for $90.  it’s nice having a mechanic in the family.
1123 2018-09-29 21:01:43 Should make next week interesting atb 
1124 2018-09-29 21:00:55 Reallllly need to take my baby to get oil change . I be forgetting ....
1125 2018-09-29 21:00:29 Anyone good oil tycoon investors!
Please give me money!
1126 2018-09-29 21:00:15 おやすみるく〜
1127 2018-09-29 21:00:06 September 29, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1128 2018-09-29 20:59:51 Vitamin E oil is great for your skin. It keeps it looking young and plump!
1129 2018-09-29 20:59:00 A lot of people have a degree for something they don't have the oil for, but i won't be petty...
1130 2018-09-29 20:58:47 How will anyone sleep tonight with all this excitement #ukog
1131 2018-09-29 20:57:35 #PalmOil is causing havoc to Indonesian forests & wildlife. @PepsiCo is fuelling this, through business partnership with one of the industry’s worst offenders @Indofood. RT to join me in calling on CEO @IndraNooyi to end Pepsi’s palm oil crimes
1132 2018-09-29 20:57:27  I m a Fresh Petroleum Engg grad. Trust me when i say thats all I hv bn doing 4 the last 4 yrs, hoping & praying it keeps climbing. 

Anyways, I ws talking abt Dar's period specifically, we took IMFs bailout + Oil prices tanked, hence the Macroeconomic stability for 3 years
1133 2018-09-29 20:57:18 Enhance Oil Recovery, Drilling Engineering.
1134 2018-09-29 20:56:57 Yes, somebody get that waxy, oil soaked, greasy face, lying SOB out of there! 
1135 2018-09-29 20:56:42 Hey Brian . . Fill ‘er up    with ethyl, and please check my oil too.
1136 2018-09-29 20:56:32 Wow, of course oil companies just started drilling oil several months ago when you took office. Way to take credit for something you had nothing to do with. Nothing new.
1137 2018-09-29 20:56:27 Industry guy here. This is a very big deal. There are two equally important commodities produced in Alberta. Oil and natgas. Both are landlocked and subject to a single customer. It’s not one or the other, it’s both. Oil at least is in demand in US. Natgas not so much. Be happy.
1138 2018-09-29 20:56:24 it took me 6 fucking months and all the castor oil i could find but my eyebrows are finally even. blessed fuckin be
1139 2018-09-29 20:56:13 Oil and Zionism IMO.
1140 2018-09-29 20:56:08 Precisely ... and those like DONALD TRUMP will DO ANYTHING and KILL ANYBODY to get that oil. He's already proven it.
1141 2018-09-29 20:56:04 Really!! This the same Basra that UK army fled in 2011-12 and handed over the city to Iraqi militia backed  by Iran!!  You Brits are master of leaving the job half done. Cut and run !! You sold Kirkuk to Iran as well! Only to have BP to take over oil contract!! We know well!
1142 2018-09-29 20:56:01 IM READY FOR OIL PAINTING
1143 2018-09-29 20:55:57 ぽや
1144 2018-09-29 20:55:44 "What are you mad about today?"

My car smells like an oil spill
1145 2018-09-29 20:55:31 Northeast (finance, biz, ag)
South (grits, bible, no abortion, Christianity)
Midwest (ag, bible, meat, god)
Southwest (oil, cowboys, independence)
Wear (recreation, pot, entertainment, kale)
Constitution but w regional interpretation
1146 2018-09-29 20:55:30 Finally got an oil change 
1147 2018-09-29 20:55:23 Not only does the USA have more crude oil but we also have A crude president!! Trump should take the lead and get aboard one of his Space Force's vehicles and get the hell off the planet Earth!!!!
1148 2018-09-29 20:55:18 This looks like northern manitoba lol. Probably not though. Not much oil up theee at all
1149 2018-09-29 20:55:05 I din't know the witches needed oil,
1150 2018-09-29 20:54:40 That is a combination of laziness and contempt and more than a little lack of intellect. The man is a snake oil seller. They have always walked amongst us.
1151 2018-09-29 20:54:34 Any state Governor aspirant apart the ones from Lagos and the other oil rich ones promising you heaven and earth, would not be able to deliver anything except financial and constitutional restructuring happens.
1152 2018-09-29 20:54:14 Who knows where the song “Aza” by DMW, Davido, Duncan Mighty & Peruzzi was shot at?
I am almost certain it’s in the Niger Delta, but not sure where precisely.
I like how it exposes so much of the disturbing oil spillage in that region, and a music video with Davido in it travels.
1153 2018-09-29 20:54:07 I've heard good things about CBD oil. It's worth a try. Just research the benefits of it and maybe that can be of some help to you. For good measure, I'll say a prayer for you.
1154 2018-09-29 20:54:05 Yeah some of us are not investing in Tesla to make money. It would be nice, yes, but the main focus of my investment is advancing our global dependence on oil and carbon fuels.  If you cant handle the heat there are much safer bets out there.
1155 2018-09-29 20:54:02 hair oil really be making my hair look like it’s actually healthy
1156 2018-09-29 20:53:56 Getting an oil change has me feeling like a responsible adult
1157 2018-09-29 20:53:53 That site is a creditable as a bag of used oil rags. Just a breitbart wannabe site
1158 2018-09-29 20:53:33 whaat I hated about the oil painting class was how long we took on the color chart, it was a week and a half, by that time people just want to do it and get rid of it. Then the real painting started 
1159 2018-09-29 20:53:26 It's all about OIL as usual. I saw today where Saudi Arabia is starting on a pipeline in Yemen. Same old same old. Iraq, Libya, Syria. Maybe the best thing would be to get out of the OIL business for good???
1160 2018-09-29 20:52:47 Aloe with lavender oil mixed in it and you'll be a happy camper, just make sure to avoid aloe that has alcohol in it.

Oil of Olaz

Neon Phoenix
1162 2018-09-29 20:52:09 Oil are dreaming of Sauerkraut and Beer, Drai and Reider have been pumping the currywurst tires for days!
1163 2018-09-29 20:52:06 So drop the oil prices please!
1164 2018-09-29 20:51:59 oil prices, has clawed back almost all those wage gains, as David Leonhardt documents at the New York Times.
1165 2018-09-29 20:51:59 The best thing about making tuna croquettes is that the recipe comes with a built-in kitty snack so he's distracted from the pan of hot oil on the stove.

The second best thing, naturally, is having tuna croquettes to eat.
1166 2018-09-29 20:51:44 You cannot even influence your own wife to change her mind! Who do you think you will influence against Ruto?
1167 2018-09-29 20:51:34 LMAO you're hung up on oil lanterns in a video game?!
1168 2018-09-29 20:51:33 GREAT NEWS NO MORE DEPENDING ON RUSSIA OR SAUDI ARABIA FOR OIL!! OVER CHARGING AMERICA FOR THERE OIL!!
1169 2018-09-29 20:50:52 I do feel some offense to that comment as I feel by supporting Alberta oil and being unsupportive of spending money on countries where it is used to cause situations creating 100s of thousands of refugees.
1170 2018-09-29 20:50:51 IMO, the endgame in Africa seems to be elites wanting to clear it out for themselves. Rem Gates vaccinated all. He believes in depopulation. Sending migrants to Europe, selling land to China, Africa's resources, gold, diamonds, oil, uranium, etc... even materials for smartphones!
1171 2018-09-29 20:50:36 I'd prefer to decrease the amount of oil we're using and CO2 we're releasing into the atmosphere
1172 2018-09-29 20:50:33 Uses of Chebe Powder and Kakar Oil.
Now available @ #1500 for a set.
1173 2018-09-29 20:50:30 that’s because u wash it every day! if you gradually stop washing it as much, the oil won’t build up and catch the dirt
1174 2018-09-29 20:50:15 The US is now the biggest oil producer in the world so maybe you need a tin foil hat. The US does not want Iran to sell oil to west at this time. The US is there to keep Assad from committing genocide and make sure Iran goes back home.
1175 2018-09-29 20:50:15 Beard oil can make or break a beard.
1176 2018-09-29 20:50:05 Scotland and Edinburgh have been taking advantage of Shetland, Orkney and the western isles for decades.

It's no your oil! It's wirs!
1177 2018-09-29 20:49:48 i have one a loose onesies, a fan and a citronella oil candle and i STILL got bit by a mosquito
FUCK MOSQUITO LIVES
1178 2018-09-29 20:49:22 The price paid for top oil producer is contaminated aquifers from fracking for oil. Furthermore fracking companies are losing money & have to be subsidized. IMO
1179 2018-09-29 20:49:20 I found a channel on Youtube that has the old episodes of "Oil Change" and oh my god the Oilers are so incredibly inept it's amazing.

1183 2018-09-29 20:48:23 You’d prefer to have to import all your oil and plastic products and give your money to the Arab countries in the Middle East?
1184 2018-09-29 20:48:21 Prices are only going to go higher. Oil has peaked.
1185 2018-09-29 20:48:09 They are victims too..  They are killed in their homes as well..  That's not an excuse for murder. 

At the end of the day,  they all are victims also trying to survive
1186 2018-09-29 20:48:07 The Minister of Internal Trade and Consumer Protection has ordered increased testing of samples of olive oil originating from Idlib province after rumours alleging tampering surfaced. The testing is to ensure compliance with Syrian health and safety standards.
1187 2018-09-29 20:48:00 Need an oil change, but never seem to have the time to book an appointment. Well your in luck, stop by Eichenberg Chrysler anytume for an oil change. No appointment necessary! #EichenbergChrysler #Chrysler #oilchange #servicedepartment #Tillsonburg #OxfordCounty

1195 2018-09-29 20:46:30 here comes the carnival snake oil salesman Donald @realDonaldTrump
1196 2018-09-29 20:45:50 That damn oil change young
1197 2018-09-29 20:45:47 My dad really had to call me to remind me to get an oil change. What would I do without this man
1198 2018-09-29 20:45:32 George Soros and the other rich atheist Leftists are funding AGW. Big oil knows AGW is BS and the Left is trying to destroy their industry with a lie.
1199 2018-09-29 20:45:24 #FakeChristians have run amok and and have no shame. @JerryFalwellJr is nothing more than a snake oil peddler of fake faith.
1200 2018-09-29 20:45:20 It’s important that you build up dosage, and leave a 2hr gap between the oil and other meds. The support group is great and you’ll find lots of helpful info and support there x
1201 2018-09-29 20:45:13 So, in other words, we'll be going back to the "Harper government's" I know better than you do and I'm good with anything that makes Alberta oil interests happy approach huh?
1202 2018-09-29 20:45:00 You already know the health benefits for CBD in humans, but what about for your pets? 

CBD oil for dogs works in much the same way that it does for humans. In fact, research shows that all vertebrates, including mammals, have what is known as an endocannabinoid system.
1203 2018-09-29 20:44:59 The politics of the right universally supports the oil industry. The right also opposes Canada's very own refugee laws. You are conflicted but have chosen oil over people.
1204 2018-09-29 20:44:53 what about oil price, still up not down
Show us what you can do to solve it

1207 2018-09-29 20:44:42 We have enough 4th line forwards to make a package.
1208 2018-09-29 20:44:13 Do you feel human rights are irrelevant in this situation? 
Perhaps other "oil fans" only "discovered" human rights but I have been concerned with this since I first started paying for fuel myself.
1209 2018-09-29 20:44:11 I think he saves time and effort and just uses his glove oil.
1210 2018-09-29 20:44:05 I agree. Need a REAL NHL D that can potentially move up and down the lineup. Cannot have a third liner playing second line minutes this season.
1211 2018-09-29 20:43:50 Usually do unsalted grassfed butter, cacao butter and XCT oil 
1212 2018-09-29 20:43:47 Been getting that gelato oil, lakeside  northwest Indiana
1213 2018-09-29 20:43:44 Yesterday I had a hair appt, and when I got home I showered and put some coconut oil in my hair. I let Bart stay with me, 10 min later, he was up, licking the oil out of my hair! I had to be up early today so I kicked him out.
1214 2018-09-29 20:43:42 I dont think we can ever view these agencies or gov in general like we used to ever again. The infiltration of leftist ideologues is worse than communist infiltration during cold war.
1215 2018-09-29 20:43:33 Need to get oil for my pen
1216 2018-09-29 20:43:28 Got the OJ, now to stop and get my alcohol when oil is done
1217 2018-09-29 20:43:19 Cook with animal fats, butter, ghee, natural coconut oil and palm oil. Avoid vegetable and cooking oils which are extremely processed #tips
1218 2018-09-29 20:43:10 Some actually drill for oil or mine for coal..... I wonder why they can't just notice when the btm is uncomfortable and stop pounding....... Guess they are just selfish.
1219 2018-09-29 20:43:05 So far the top contenders are: thc/weed, bourbon, lavender and motor oil
1220 2018-09-29 20:43:05 Why am I paying out the ass for gasoline? The oil companies are and have neen for quite so time making record profits, and still oil is up as well as gasoline. I under stand no one in Washington buys gas because tax payers foot the bill, but come on ! We need a break!
1221 2018-09-29 20:42:56 What were oil bond of Cong regime? .. deferred oil tax with interest... you enjoyed it then pay now for Cong deferred tax...
1222 2018-09-29 20:42:48 Not to mention getting less dependant on shit like Saudi oil money. The earlier we get rid of that the better.

1227 2018-09-29 20:41:58 I never said big oil. I said big rail. Warren Buffet would be a good example.
1228 2018-09-29 20:41:51 not that much is funny part, which assuages actually my earlier worry that the weed oil was insuffient in quality
1229 2018-09-29 20:41:38 Maybe it's because I'm not a native English speaker, but I think might and fitness are very close notions, near synonymous.

1240 2018-09-29 20:39:43 Not in the typical sense. People talk about oil dependency in the sense that we’re still reliant on buying and using it. This was an issue of production elsewhere out-pacing demand, and driving prices too low for US production to be profitable.
1241 2018-09-29 20:39:43 Have you considered commissioning an oil painting.
1242 2018-09-29 20:39:31 im not sure if it's legal where you're at but cbd oil has helped me a ton. it's helped me go from a full anxiety attack to being at a baseline average mood in just a few minutes
1243 2018-09-29 20:38:34 The sanctions of US have hit many many countries globally as it was not anticipated. India should've been sensible enough to have some percent (15%) of crude oil imports from a US adversary like Russia rather than depending totally on Iran.
1244 2018-09-29 20:38:24 Ok so to my A-Cup sisters out here. I wouldn't want to seem selfish so here you go.....

1250 2018-09-29 20:37:22 IIRC in Van Buren, the Enclave thought the Shi were the ones who destroyed the Oil Tanker, and nuked San Francisco.
Even though VB isn't canon, Obsidian still wanted to keep some of those details intact
1251 2018-09-29 20:37:02 You got me there though oil sands and even fracking, is a little out of control... its the basis of a huge part of our economy though so doubt this will change unless a replacement for oil as a primary energy source becomes available.

1254 2018-09-29 20:36:46 We don't need oil. We just need the strength of will to bore deep to endure winters.

1265 2018-09-29 20:35:09 Actually UK can do better deals than EU as UK only has 1 priority its own, EU has 27 countries squabbling to get their priorities to the top of the pile, also UK more nimble and quickers that the oil tanker EU and could do deals much faster. All positives.
1266 2018-09-29 20:35:08 Love that the Oil Industry fans have discovered human rights. Don't worry this virtue signalling will disappear as soon as it's inconvenient.
1267 2018-09-29 20:34:51 for anyone with anxiety, i recommend CBD oil - it works wonders for me (haven’t been able to find a good medication that helps)
1268 2018-09-29 20:34:37 FUEL RIP OFF
 Apart from rip off #CORRUPTION, can someone explain why diesel costs £1.36 p in town garage and yet is £1.26 p in ASDA ?
Both prices at self service pumps.
Town closer to oil depot than ASDA.
1269 2018-09-29 20:34:35 How about African Natiions stop being cowards, and raise up against the oppressors who are sitting on all of your wealth and take it back!!? Africa is the wealthiest continent on the planet! The diamonds, silver, gold, platinum, uranium and oil is yours! Take it back!!
1270 2018-09-29 20:33:53 Fair point. 
Do you prefer that more oil is bought from countries with many more human rights violations than Canada? Climate change is happening. Why should oil be bought from countries responsible for the greatest humanitarian crisis of the century?
1271 2018-09-29 20:33:38 DIFFERENT shades of Olive, meaning OLIVE OIL colors. None white ALL have different colors, different  variant  colors of olive oil
1272 2018-09-29 20:33:29 The correct amount of oil was added. The product was shipped to me as defective as I have now noticed the oil at the bottom of the box it came in. Not sure how this got past @TroyBilt quality assurance.
1273 2018-09-29 20:33:13 My English teacher noticed that i am a clown from the beginning when I said that we shouldn't use oil because we didn't want to die so soon and because i made jokes about tea
1274 2018-09-29 20:32:46 It clearly says that From the year 2010-11, under recoveries bill of Oil Companies are paid through Government exchequer. Presently, majority of the bills are paid within one year from the date of expenditure. 2/2
1275 2018-09-29 20:32:27 I had a regal once, changed the oil and forgot to put the oil plug back in.
1276 2018-09-29 20:32:17 .@RossChastain "Everything is good, have a little bit of oil temperature, 235" up to p13, going to stay out
1277 2018-09-29 20:32:02 It also means other, less responsible countries, get to produce more and That we continue to pay more for imported oil on the east coast.
1278 2018-09-29 20:31:48 No hazmat for us!! Tanker, but things like synthetic latex for paint, glue, an environmentally friendly form release coating to replace oil based to a few plywood Mills. I do run "the Highway through Hell" from the Discovery channel a few times a year still though 
1279 2018-09-29 20:31:47 Rutherford didn't mind sacrificing the regular JW's in the line of fire getting tarred and feathered or attacked, he was too busy changing the oil in his 12 cylinder  Cadillacs. The guy was a big drinker and abusive. Not a nice man to say the least...

1282 2018-09-29 20:31:23 Do you ever sit and list the assignments you have left for the semester and then realise that there’s a week where you’re going to be walking through fire after being dunked in oil? I do...
1283 2018-09-29 20:31:22 If you suffer from anxiety ans intrusive thoughts, I HIGHLY recommend CBD oil. Honestly it has changed my life even with the low dose one I've used. It even helps with sleep!
1284 2018-09-29 20:31:15 Blame for the rising petrol prices should be shared between the State & the Union govt equally. Firstly the Union govt is in a panic mode since the crude oil prices have risen due to the US sanctions & this was not forseen by them.
1285 2018-09-29 20:31:01 Lamp oil, rope, bombs? You want it? It's yours, my friend, as long as you have enough rubies.
1286 2018-09-29 20:31:01 Like for example Tator Tots are so much better prepared in the oven with herbs and olive oil
1287 2018-09-29 20:30:55 Yeah just found it Ben mate cheers. This is massive news
1288 2018-09-29 20:30:35 People who sell oils kill me.

Mix this oil, that oil, and this other oil together, rub it on your skin, put it in a diffuser, use it as a mouthwash, and mop your floors with it. It smells amazing.

No, it smells like a McKesson truck crashed into ABC Liquor store, but nice try.
1289 2018-09-29 20:30:03 BMW isn’t in this league when it comes to electric. The entire oil and auto supported media is against TSLA, yet they sold 500k cars site unseen. As the word gets out about the 3, which it is, profits will follow.
1290 2018-09-29 20:30:01 So what's your thoughts on Big Oil Execs and Lobbyists donating huge sums of money to politicians who then to get the laws rolled back on environmental protections?
1291 2018-09-29 20:30:00 Sugar, enriched flour, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.
1292 2018-09-29 20:29:51 Long overdue for an oil change, so figured I’d go to the @SearsAuto near me. I made an appointment, I was told online it would be an hour. They quoted me 90 minutes when I dropped it off. Came back, told me another 20ish minutes. #NotCool
1293 2018-09-29 20:29:49 Applying these standards to public employ generally would shrink government to the point of practical nonexistence.  Spring break prob out of question if you want a public job.

1311 2018-09-29 20:25:50 One of the best businesses that I have found to work for, message me for more information. Physicians and Nurses are signing up each week because they know how good our oil is.  Follow me to stay informed.
1312 2018-09-29 20:25:30 I'm not a fan of the public hearing with 5 min time limit. Closed door hearings are not limited in time and protect against witnesses knowing details. This is all for show, but I do support using same tactics in future for all dem nominees.
1313 2018-09-29 20:25:22 Oh buttercup, I’ve given proof from Hmrc,from oil and gas companies and even in colour! If u have a prob talk to them itstheirfigs sweetie!

1327 2018-09-29 20:22:48 Think of all those jobs in decommissioning Scotland’s dying oil industry. Some of them may come to Scotland if we can get the Eastern Europeans willing to do the work. More likely Scotland will be outbid.

1337 2018-09-29 20:21:42 Engine oil might keep me going but idk
1338 2018-09-29 20:21:36 about, like ending US aggression. Oil companies' profits aren't worth a single life, not theirs, not yours, not anybody's.
1339 2018-09-29 20:21:35 Really? We live in Iran so we know the situation much better than you.oil sanctions are great pressures on Mulla regime to stop supporting terrorism and suppressing Iranian citizens.
1340 2018-09-29 20:21:30 I’d love to see some palm oil free options too if possible! Looks wonderful! X
1341 2018-09-29 20:21:28 Filled my screenwash up today and I’ve never felt so empowered. My dad had to she my where it goes but I did it all myself  even checked my oil. Small steps in becoming an adult 
1342 2018-09-29 20:21:26 @OnyxandRoseCBD @katyhearnFit @HaydnSchneider how do I find the right dosage for the CBD oil for the weight of the person taking it?
1343 2018-09-29 20:21:23 So no active monitering ? What is wrong with those people . Don’t care about there own people , and all that oil wealth to use !!! Corruption !!
1344 2018-09-29 20:21:22 That's Awesome Beth that you are wanting to try CBD Oil! Do you have any questions about CBD Oil?
1345 2018-09-29 20:21:17 What you're describing is a fishing expedition to expose minor technical details having nothing to do with accusation and mostly subjective. Good thing hearing was public, they know how to respond.
1346 2018-09-29 20:21:14 Yup 
Mixed with coconut oil 
Twice daily
1347 2018-09-29 20:21:06 Yeah, I meant patients should have a choice (I'm a free market fan). Regarding the cost, home grow will cost €3 or (much) less per gram of flower. Say 15%CBD = €3 per 150mg = €20 per gram. Depending on preference, either vape directly or make oil. Yes more work, but...
1348 2018-09-29 20:21:00 Also I prefer to fill my car and use oil products that I have confidence knowing they did not directly contribute to the coffers of governments that have abhorrent human rights records.
1349 2018-09-29 20:20:58 Me too at University of Chicago for grad school. Classmates were prep school kids with oil money. They didn't understand why I needed a part time job or student loans.

1354 2018-09-29 20:20:28 OMG red potatoes perfectly roasted in olive oil with garlic and fresh rosemary...
1355 2018-09-29 20:20:15 Not entirely sure on the effects of vaping although have heard a few reports some good and some bad. I have experience with oil for lower back pain which has worked not only that it helps me sleep better. My sister takes it successfully for anxiety
1356 2018-09-29 20:20:11 It is! I haven't been to the movies in ages so I can't confirm that they still use coconut oil but they did when I was growing up. It's very fattening and very delicious!! I don't eat popcorn often but I do love it,too!
1357 2018-09-29 20:19:47 I lost my favourite denim jacket last night along with my keys, and then this morning I shattered a family size olive oil from COSCTO in my kitchen and then when I tried to clean it up I pulled a “COME GET YA’ll JUICE” and bodyslammed into the olive oil
1358 2018-09-29 20:19:43 I see. Well it might feel really dry because the water and oil in your skin would vaporize almost instantaneously
1359 2018-09-29 20:19:29 Rub castor oil morning and night for a few minutes
1360 2018-09-29 20:19:11 Ha fair enough. Current deal may still come good sooner rather than later, & if not I suspect they will have others very keen with the current oil price. Be interesting to see if anyone has other suggestions though, or any with lower market caps.
1361 2018-09-29 20:19:00 石油だってオリーブオイルだって牛脂だって仲間さ、そうだろう?
1362 2018-09-29 20:18:56 Who?

1368 2018-09-29 20:17:37 If you are a would-be snake oil salesman that isn't willing to submit to a bear hug from quackery, you may as well renounce quackery now.

1376 2018-09-29 20:16:39 That's like asking during the transition that began in 1908 for horses to the Model T which stables offer oil chances.....

1377 2018-09-29 20:16:34 I have an essential oil addiction & it’s bad 
1378 2018-09-29 20:16:34 I am truly enjoying the Oillers broadcast. One guys calls everything for the Oil and the other keeps pointing out #Flames logic while pissing the first guy off. This makes me happy
1379 2018-09-29 20:16:31 Make no mistake - big oil holds the cards now

1384 2018-09-29 20:15:55 Had a similar discussion a while back in which we agreed that Tinubu uses his wealth to oil his patronage network, which in turn increases his power/influence.
1385 2018-09-29 20:15:50 This is definitely a real thing by a real person. I also have some land to sell, pennies an acre and there's both oil AND gold there contact me for details.

1418 2018-09-29 20:10:53 thank u. FDC is a party that has Uganda at heart. we are not in politics for selfish gain but to make fundamental change for the nation. Uganda needs honest discussion of its political direction and FDC burns mid night oil over this. we in this however long it takes.
1419 2018-09-29 20:10:52 I just started the oil from CBDPure, for the same reason. For the last two days I have felt human again! It feels amazing to be relaxed.
1420 2018-09-29 20:10:50 You are just either confused or constitution illiterate...
What's the difference between water and oil,as resources?
1421 2018-09-29 20:10:45 That oil won’t benefit anyone.. that is if it is true..just like the diamonds  show me one  family or person who benefited anything except Zanu pf crooks .
1422 2018-09-29 20:10:21 たらこって美味いよな！
1423 2018-09-29 20:10:19 Oil is the second most abundant fluid on earth next to water, smarten up niggas it’s all business moves don’t get left behind.
1424 2018-09-29 20:10:17 Ok...how bout threading oil or vasiline.some goop to cool down the bit?!?!?!?
1425 2018-09-29 20:10:15 This is my life now. Nose tampons are a necessary accessory. Olbas Oil is the perfume of choice. I will construct monuments of snotty tissues to the memory of my former self. I am not being tragic, honest.

1427 2018-09-29 20:10:04 If you want to be rich in this country, sell something.

Services, product, oil, propaganda, lie, show, sex, drug, hope, miracle, knowledge, properties, idea, whatever, just sell something. 

Thank you for coming to my TED talk.
1428 2018-09-29 20:09:57 This lady tried selling essential oils to ileana and i yesterday and the first one she pulled out was called emotional oil to soothe any emotional disbalance........ i can say she had me hooked lmao
1429 2018-09-29 20:09:54 @SenFeinstein created s situation where this is an all in hand with the stakes being far beyond this one nomination. There can be no backing down. 
She's so dumb she never realized it.  
Republicans cannot lose here.
1430 2018-09-29 20:09:51 With no palm oil
1431 2018-09-29 20:09:47 Sreesanth has this HUGE ego about him. It’s like adding water to hot oil, people like this are toxic and hard to have relations with. Dipika needs to back off or he will take her down with him. #bb12 #biggboss12
1432 2018-09-29 20:09:46 No, I didn't think you were ignoring it. I have seen the sludge in the bottom of an oil crankcase, though. Yuck.
1433 2018-09-29 20:09:33 Lamp oil aka fish oil
1434 2018-09-29 20:09:27 And dont use too much butter/oil! The bread will absorb it
1435 2018-09-29 20:08:52 Also, I was recently reminded, US is almost top oil producer in the world. All profits for subsidized, offshored oil bastard monopolies.
1436 2018-09-29 20:08:52 Look at the map It’s in colour just to help u, follow the lines from where it comes ashore at st fergus bypassing Grangemouth which is doing fracking gas now not oil!
1437 2018-09-29 20:08:42 So that was the reason! Oil deposits!
1438 2018-09-29 20:08:33 Cbd water usually does the trick especially if I’m throwing up because it’s not oil based like the tincture but I do love my tincture.. I feel like it makes me sleepy though
1439 2018-09-29 20:08:18 We're  sorry to see this, Chris. Is there a chance too much oil was added before starting it? Products with manufacturers defects can be returned within 30 days of purchase.
1440 2018-09-29 20:08:10 I agree but do you know that nearly all soaps have palm oil? It's nearly impossible to find a bar without it.
1441 2018-09-29 20:08:06 Blood of Christ covers me, our saviour and healer 
Oil prices up and down, I know a few dealers
1442 2018-09-29 20:08:03 Baby powder, coconut oil and Vaseline are the best beauty products ever. If you disagree, please unfollow me.
1443 2018-09-29 20:07:57 140 characters limits me but I was not referring to burning oil in electricity generation. Its reliability in powering machines that have awhile before they can be effectively replaced, its importance in manufactured goods INC. The production of renewable electricity products
1444 2018-09-29 20:07:45 Matt you have a Golf R,and old oil burner of a beemer,and two kick ass bikes...throw that VR crap in the bin.
1445 2018-09-29 20:07:17 Energy companies know they can't keep drilling for oil forever. Rational action would be for them to embrace solar or wind power so that they could continue to function after a transition. But they're not doing it. Why? Profits now demanded by shareholders.
1446 2018-09-29 20:07:16 The guy doing my oil change looks like Seth Rogen and sounds like Rex from Toy Story

1449 2018-09-29 20:06:50 My job sucks. Anyone have any open positions for baby oil applicators at a school for wayward ladies interested in becoming sun tan models?

1452 2018-09-29 20:06:32 Coconut oil
1453 2018-09-29 20:06:11 I usually put peppers like that on the grill with a bunch of olive oil, but those look pretty good that way too.
1454 2018-09-29 20:06:06 فى كل انحاء العالم متوفر زيت الفول السوداني peanut oil او  ground nut oil  عدا هنا فى  السعودية حتى فى بريطانيا والولايات المتحده  لماذا لا يرغبون زيت الفول السوداني وليس متوفر في الاسواق هو  اشهر زيت صحى و ممتاز وبشهادة اشهر شركات العالم لماذا لا يتوفر هنا فى السعودية
1455 2018-09-29 20:06:03 So now we know why Venezuela is a mess, Western countries destroyed Venezuela because of oil, today if you are lucky don't claim to have oil otherwise you will end up the likes of Libya, Iraq Nigeria and Venezuela or under constant threat like Iran

1458 2018-09-29 20:05:52 Its possible, I wonder why a new road was approved to be constructed through that same route
1459 2018-09-29 20:05:47 Fun fact we will never run out of oil because oil replenishes itself and there’s no such thing as fossil fuel oil doesn’t come from bone.
1460 2018-09-29 20:05:28 The boys over at the @Valvoline oil change on Bosley in Owensboro KY just took care of me and my car.  Very happy

1462 2018-09-29 20:05:18 I drive at least 250 miles a week for work. More when I have to hoof it to Austin or Houston. I wasn't trying to ignore your comment, the oil was as clean as it's always been upon draining.
1463 2018-09-29 20:05:09 Because oil execs wanted her in, mercy, do some research!
1464 2018-09-29 20:05:07 @cbdbrothers does the cbd oil help with arthritis? Thank you
1465 2018-09-29 20:04:51 replace single use plastics with hemp - an annual crop that produces employment and cholesterol reducing cold pressed oil from the seed (plant sterols).  it would reduce the environmental footprint for paper making industries by over 83%
1466 2018-09-29 20:04:50 Here it comes.  I've been saying this forever.  Trump owes 500 million (or so) to Russian oil company, Blackwell. They have ties to biggest real estate company in USA ( anyone can Google this)
1467 2018-09-29 20:04:34 oil change x full tank of gas>>>>>>
1468 2018-09-29 20:04:31 And Rick Scott is all in on this. Big oil one of his largest contributors.

1470 2018-09-29 20:04:04 I did use a muscle relief essential oil blend on my upper back where I could reach it and that has helped a little.
1471 2018-09-29 20:03:55 Woman really be stopping me in public and ask what I’m wearing that smell so good.. 

It’s really this simple body oil?
1472 2018-09-29 20:03:20 500 tonnes oil per day  Anyone good at big sums?
1473 2018-09-29 20:02:44 I am thankful for the days of peace we have now, but I am buying oil for my lamps now with the other wise virgins. The times of testing and tribulation will happen suddenly like a thief in the night.
1474 2018-09-29 20:02:41 Aren't you aware of oil bonds which our existing government is repaying?
1475 2018-09-29 20:02:37 @realDonaldTrump Emergency Oil Supplies can be used to control high fuel prices. High fuel prices added to the raising of interest rates by Federal Reserve may cause inflation. From EU they are forecasting a global economic recession arround 2020 & blaming you for that
1476 2018-09-29 20:02:30 Ridiculous! And guess what we are still fighting against the religious right who, fortunately, are dwindling and very annoyed because they are losing the battle Ms Cousens you are no oil painting yourself or most of the Govt. What a joke!
1477 2018-09-29 20:02:21 Oil of every pearls uninsides?
1478 2018-09-29 20:02:21 Like extroversion olive oil? It’s for cooking I think
1479 2018-09-29 20:02:14 There is about 3,500 barrels in 500 tonnes of oil. At the current oil price that is £287,000 per day in revenue from 4 wells. £105 Million per year! #ukog

1482 2018-09-29 20:02:06 I agree, it is a strong critique of a presidential style system.  It seems that the US executive branch is showing similar trends, only from the extreme right.  TBF, in Venezuela economic issues exacerbate the problem, such as dependence on oil / lack of economic diversification.
1483 2018-09-29 20:02:04 I have no patience with people that say "this is a war for oil" or "the crisis was caused by falling of oil price". How do you cope with these superficial arguments? Venezuela has received the equivalent to 25 Marshall plan and the majority of that money is in offshore accounts.
1484 2018-09-29 20:01:42 Not many left to pick from on AIM now though mate.  The last oil price crash took most of them down.  

#WTI pushing to highs of four years ago and small caps not really responding.

1487 2018-09-29 20:01:14 See: arms trades with Saudi Arabia, oil pipelines over indigenous land
1488 2018-09-29 20:01:13 Now, as I watch the sunrise.
Ah, the smell of oil, the morning light.
There's but one shadow cast on the asphalt.

1493 2018-09-29 20:00:23 You ask for an FBI investigation to clear your name and show that you  (as you stated under oath). 1) never got so drunk that you blacked out, 2) you don't drink to excess now. 3) that all your school friends will tell the FBI that Devil's Triangle. Is a drinking game, 4)etc.
1494 2018-09-29 20:00:21 I have my diffuser on with rose essential oil, my modelo in hand, and my favorite soccer team on, now I just need a man (to suck me off)

Adrian: *runs and slides on the oil and breaks the oven* 

Carter: SHIT
1496 2018-09-29 20:00:05 Madam Petrol was cheaper at that  time, today the oil in the global market has become expensive
1497 2018-09-29 19:59:47 I’ll give it a shot because I find myself constantly dabbing oil off throughout the day and it’s constant
1498 2018-09-29 19:59:42 Honestly SAME. I think he’s just accepted his fate. BUT you can put lavender essential oil on your pillows so no one has to smell it but you!
1499 2018-09-29 19:59:38 I appreciate the marketing strategy but I get free oil changes

1503 2018-09-29 19:58:58 Dean do you know if the oil game is broadcast on Shaw today? Thanks !
1504 2018-09-29 19:58:56 #SaudiArabia has recently announced investment of 500 billion SR (133 billion $) on the next ten years. One reason for this is because #Venezuela does not invest in its own oil market.
1505 2018-09-29 19:58:43 This is nonsense on a tower! Anyone who knows Zim’s geology and hails from that part of Zim like Makandiwa knows it’s been established long back that there is oil in the Zambezi valley.

I'm onto you @Pantene. Your secrets won't be hidden forever.

1509 2018-09-29 19:58:28 Ok so now the taste and texture is ruined and I've just read it's packed with palm oil and pro badger cull, Cadburys is no longer a company I'm proud of as a Brit. Won't be buying it now.
1510 2018-09-29 19:58:25 You don't need a Tele photo lense with two of those Monster BKP Tankers looking down your throat I can assure you!
1511 2018-09-29 19:58:12 please take this statement back until you’ve tried deep river’s rosemary & olive oil kettle chips because I used to be blind like you but now I see
1512 2018-09-29 19:57:53 Pepsi has a palm oil problem & its CEO @IndraNooyi has one week left at the helm, it’s time for her to end @PepsiCo’s deals with scandal-mired #palmoil business partner @Indofood
1513 2018-09-29 19:57:52 Asked the guys at Xpresso to keep the coffee rinds for me so I can make a body scrub with that, brown sugar and olive oil
1514 2018-09-29 19:57:28 With a country so blessed with oil, you’d think the only thing we’d be interested in rigging is crude oil.
1515 2018-09-29 19:57:10 I just legit listened to the guys at the oil change place convince a girl she needed a $45 engine wash. Thank goodness my uncle raised me around cars to know better and not be taken advantage of. Y’all need to educate yourselves.
1516 2018-09-29 19:57:02 Is it true that BL designed the P76's trunk so that it could carry an oil drum? (Or possibly a keg?) Heard that a million years ago, but I've never been able to verify it.
1517 2018-09-29 19:57:00 Wild grow oil
1518 2018-09-29 19:56:46 Yes get out there and enjoy them before your bedfellow Drumpf destroys them and builds resorts, estates, and more useless casinos for his and your wealthy donars. You can sell the rest to NRA for gun ranges and let the Koch brothers drill for oil.
1519 2018-09-29 19:56:45 So I was getting an oil change and my dude went ahead and gave me a nice discount and went ahead and refilled all my other fluids and cleaned the inside of my car for free. Not gonna complain
1520 2018-09-29 19:56:44 If anyone on here could get me wax/oil I could use in a pen lmk. Just got dubbed by a dealer because he found a cat outside and wanted to save it.
1521 2018-09-29 19:56:43 I design subsea oil and gas systems
1522 2018-09-29 19:56:43 Saudis will make statements to push down oil price. No doubt about that but I am prepared and ready for that.
1523 2018-09-29 19:56:42 My camera was made for Tanker Videos! I'm not chucking it now!
1524 2018-09-29 19:56:38 Haven't had my oil changed since March 
1525 2018-09-29 19:56:36 Squeaky left wheels will always get the oil
1526 2018-09-29 19:56:29 Nah Chief this ain’t it, this mans injects synthol (oil) into his body for that pump. It’s all fake
1527 2018-09-29 19:56:29 President Donnie, as a good man once called him. has told King, I suggest you pump oil : #SAUDI KING SALMAN AND TRUMP REVIEWING EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN OIL SUPPLIES AND ENSURE STABILITY OF OIL MARKET: AL EKHBARIYA. #OOTT

1530 2018-09-29 19:56:12 Well, you're not a ram yourself. But beware of the sludge that small amount of oil may have left behind.
1531 2018-09-29 19:55:56 Red oil nd pepper
1532 2018-09-29 19:55:45  nah, I was just shaving with coconut oil
1533 2018-09-29 19:55:43 Not happy with oil prices 
1534 2018-09-29 19:55:34 Tweeps can't see no barrel of oil. They want to tar and  feather you for your statement. Not sure which group you have riled up--those who ritually proclaim USA is a Republic not a democracy or those that do that opposite.
1535 2018-09-29 19:55:33 what’s the best beard oil ?

1538 2018-09-29 19:55:14 Don't think in franchise history have the oil won a matinee

I can't forget Oil and Gas
1543 2018-09-29 19:55:03 On a national level they're making multi-billion-dollar arms deals with Saudi Arabia and laying hundreds of miles of oil pipelines over indigenous land
1544 2018-09-29 19:55:01 coco nut oil for every thang
1545 2018-09-29 19:54:51 If that mans tongue game ain’t never make your body lock up like a motor without oil in it he ain’t doing it right. 
1546 2018-09-29 19:54:50 in the past week i’ve jump started my car, changed the oil, and rotated the tires, so pretty much i’m feelin like an independent woman
1547 2018-09-29 19:54:49 The long term value of oil? 
1548 2018-09-29 19:54:44 None - but we do have the honour of paying for oil and gas subsidies as well as billions for a new pipeline.
1549 2018-09-29 19:54:40 I see, your assertion is that Oil & Gas CEOs are inherently unbiased and can be trusted to determine the rules they function under with no outside viewpoints, but an environmentalist can’t be fair and unbiased. And her appointment at industry request is an attack on industry?
1550 2018-09-29 19:54:26 Yes, lead by example - get a haircut, get a real job that's not beholden to DOT or Big Oil and call us from beachside Kanasas City in 35 years.

1556 2018-09-29 19:53:45 Haya tutafutie ya sukari na cooking oil then I'll be sorted.
1557 2018-09-29 19:53:45 It’s just a shame because this is a wonderfully shining idea (as long as it’s not 100% player driven.. no one wants to be an oil miner or DMV worker in a video game..) and a lack of communication on what’s wrong and causing delays is hurting the community
1558 2018-09-29 19:53:35 Inverness. Aberdeen is nice but it’s a bit more industrial due to the North Sea oil industry. Lots of history in and around Inverness, In my opinion
1559 2018-09-29 19:53:29 ...NNPC take a whole lot of the pay as if there are the ones drilling the oil. You may wish to note that the classroom teacher add more value to the economy than the above mention but alas she is owed just one year of salary.
1560 2018-09-29 19:53:25 I put some drops of tea tree oil in my mask and my face is tingling
1561 2018-09-29 19:53:23 Perhaps it correct to remind Sihle why Venezuela is facing current challenges. It remains a distortion of facts to make plethora of accusations on their policies as the cause. Western powers decided to tout some agents posing as leaders because of their interests on oil.
1562 2018-09-29 19:53:10 Just made $25 off essential oil bracelets. This is how I pay off my college debt
1563 2018-09-29 19:52:53 It didn't work.  You must use that "Oil of Delay" stuff or something.
Or maybe you're just not a used up, worn out pawn of the left.
1564 2018-09-29 19:52:37 Hello sir! How long as crude oil price increased? What's the highest price sold now and previous government? Be sincere! I'm not convincing you but common sense not common and it's the only tool you need to know.
1565 2018-09-29 19:52:34 Well honestly, I look forward to the day we can fully convert to green technologies as well; in order to do that we have to be pragmatic and responsible with energy. We can't say no to exporting oil and yes to importing it from elsewhere and pretend that addresses carbon issues.
1566 2018-09-29 19:52:28 I think @Adrianwfire best ask Father Christmas for a new posh Camera.
His gonna need it. 
1567 2018-09-29 19:52:10 He looks like someone rubbed baby oil all over him 
1568 2018-09-29 19:52:09 Caught a whiff of something that smelled exactly like valve oil and sent me right back to my instrument playing days.
1569 2018-09-29 19:51:56 Not sure where you are coming from here the 4 countries you note have projected GDP of between 1.9 and 4.1 with UK at 1.2, what economic output will Scotland have on its own to make it so attractive and prosperous, and don't say oil ! #sickofindependencetalks#sturgeonegotrip

1579 2018-09-29 19:49:53 To be fair I do tick the box that says “salary: £100k or more” on questionnaires so I get a better class of junk mail.
However, I don’t recall ever ticking a box that said “Occupation: Brutal Dictator Of Oil Rich Banana Republic”
1580 2018-09-29 19:49:38 Why have I been here since 11:15 waiting for an oil change
1581 2018-09-29 19:49:36 @tlcohee how are you a trump supporter and love wildlife and nature ?? he’s polluting it and turning it over to oil company’s ... are you a real person ?

1586 2018-09-29 19:48:54 Not gonna happen. Almost all heating in Cleveland is natural gas or fuel oil. Ohio has the sixth-largest crude oil-refining capacity in the nation. In 2017, coal fueled 58% of Ohio's net electricity generation, natural gas fueled 24%, and nuclear energy accounted for another 15%
1587 2018-09-29 19:48:51 Getting a hot oil treatment and a good wash is everything
1588 2018-09-29 19:48:49 OMG their lip color I have from them last ALL day!! Even when you eat that damn oil and vinaigrette dressing on your salad, (usually pulls my lip color off) worth going broke over  I love their line!
1589 2018-09-29 19:48:28 Not at all. Before the Socialist government of Chavez, the oil price was less than 10$ and Venezuela were one of the most richest countries in LatAm. 20 years of socialism and misery have stolen our resourses and our lifes
1590 2018-09-29 19:48:26 I'm a very bad RAM Dad. It holds 6 quarts of oil, way overdue for an oil change, I extract 2.75 quarts of oil just now when I changed the oil.

The HEMI is a very tough engine apparently, and at 215K miles. :P

1598 2018-09-29 19:47:01 @suzuki2wheelers This is in regards to awful service received from one of your dealers, Mark Suzuki in Kurla West. My new bike Gixxer has started leaking oil and they have done nothing even after the 1st servicing. The RPM meter gets stuck when it is adjusted to 2k RPM.
1599 2018-09-29 19:46:58 CBD oil helps a lot
1600 2018-09-29 19:46:55 Coffee beans that glisten with dark oil 
1601 2018-09-29 19:46:49 I made pork chops, done in the oven in wine, olive oil and oregano and jacket potato and salad. Nostalgia meal. Also making a cake.
1602 2018-09-29 19:46:44 Cyn is dumb as shit she’d probably pay a bill for an oil change too
1603 2018-09-29 19:46:38 Ah. I'm guessing that some other fluids may work better; very light oil?
1604 2018-09-29 19:46:35 It's almost 3 how long does an oil change take!!!

1606 2018-09-29 19:46:14 Translation: I found this graph from British Petroleum on the internet that seems to support my biased opinion. I have no corroborating data or evidence, but everyone should believe what the oil company said.
1607 2018-09-29 19:46:05 It's like asking whether is better aquarel, tempera or oil... Just different techniques, everyone has something on it's own. :)
1608 2018-09-29 19:45:57 Most vehicles that are serviced in a shop require an oil change and as many as 75% are having an oil change service performed. Shop owners who use a shop management system with advance scheduling capabilities to schedule those return visits will reap the rewards of future visits.
1609 2018-09-29 19:45:49 The raid wasn't the only reason Carter lost his election it didn't help the fact he did nothing for a year was his downfall what Iran did was an act of war he should have acted as an act of war plus he was afraid of OPEC who could have put an oil embargo on oil as they did in 73
1610 2018-09-29 19:45:47 Love u babe 
1611 2018-09-29 19:45:41 So no one with any link to the oil industry or environmental issues should have been on the panel?
1612 2018-09-29 19:45:37 I hate the feeling of facial oil, but its good for my skin  dangit
1613 2018-09-29 19:45:29 I just did lashes,eyeliner and brows today and I’m actually kinda feeling. I think I would still need to use a light powder for work just to keep the oil under control
1614 2018-09-29 19:45:17 Remember natural resources doesn't bring wealth, ask Venezuela, Brazil and Iran.they have more oil them S.A
1615 2018-09-29 19:45:13 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!

1621 2018-09-29 19:44:38 Nice photo of "Boletus edulis", aka "Porcini" #Mushrooms.  Europeans know that Autumn is the perfect time to go and collect them in the Forest, to prepare for cold Winters.  Mushrooms are delicious cooked on Butter or Oil, with Onions.
1622 2018-09-29 19:44:29 How about stop using palm oil instead?
1623 2018-09-29 19:44:19 There is only one political party on earth that refuses to “believe” in fossil fuel caused climate change. They are under the influence of Big Oil and should not be trusted with our fate. Vote them out! #BlueWave2018
1624 2018-09-29 19:44:17 does he plan on dieing withing the next 4 years... Nigeria doesnt need this type of leader...we need a 21 century President that understands that oil is going to be useless like coal as all automobile companies are switching to green energy come #2020
1625 2018-09-29 19:44:11 Do you feel that the Oil & gas industry representatives on the panel had an unbiased view?
1626 2018-09-29 19:44:06 Time to go and get my car back. Had oil change done, also needs cleaning. Lets see if we can manage that too. x

1631 2018-09-29 19:43:08 It's about time we sell the strategic oil reserve to Donald Jr.. Either that, or put it on eBay
1632 2018-09-29 19:42:59 I'm getting my oil changed and this man is very loudly listening to WWE wrestling in the lounge.
1633 2018-09-29 19:42:43 More than the reserves, it's the extraction cost which matters. What's the point if it costs more to extract then the internation oil prices.
1634 2018-09-29 19:42:37 I'm coming through with the massage oil just hold on.

1639 2018-09-29 19:42:14 They’ve improved so much since first coming to the market too. Like wow. If my taste buds had minds, they’d be blown 
1640 2018-09-29 19:42:11 Emissions indeed have reduced. That's good. It has nothing to do with your plan and has everything to do with increased investments in better Technologies, more efficient oil production and a cleaner vehicle Fleet. All that without your carbon tax. So why do we need CO2 tax?
1641 2018-09-29 19:42:10 Every northerner knows how notorious these people are for their continuous act of murder and other heinous act perpetuated to people plying that route, this is one out of millions, the killers are backed by the community, if you're not a victim ,one of yours is,enough is enough!!

1649 2018-09-29 19:40:53 went to go take my brother's car in to get its oil changed, just got a call from the mechanic saying they couldn't change the oil because there was a live squirrel that had made its nest in the engine compartment
1650 2018-09-29 19:40:40 Thankfully solar and wind energy coupled with utility scale batteries are cheaper than imported oil so it won't fly

1657 2018-09-29 19:39:58 You made it ! I got my oil change done just a while ago. Time to relax and game 000;
1658 2018-09-29 19:39:46 It's because the extraction cost for oil is much more than the present oil prices. Extraction cost is minimum in case of Saudi Arabia.
1659 2018-09-29 19:39:44 Massive postal votes? Then a massive drop of regostered voters a few months later? As well as the lies..that is a form of lying isn't it? The Oil running out?
1660 2018-09-29 19:39:28 I used to put something on it to make it easier to slide down the cat's throat.  Their tongues are a little rough, and the pill will stick to it, then they spit it out.  Use a little oil from tuna fish, or something like that.
1661 2018-09-29 19:39:11 It's important to use some perfume oil on yourself before you sleep.
1662 2018-09-29 19:38:28 @realDonaldTrump A US bank buys $9 billion USD of Saudi oil. The US bank merely adjusts its ledger to show $9 billion more USD in the Saudi account. It did not cost the US bank anything to adjust its ledger. Saudi sees the money in its account and thus believes it was paid....
1663 2018-09-29 19:38:11 I completely agree, I’m sure I asked the same question to your lovely @2tophats ages ago....beauty inside and out both of ya! I’ve tried olive oil many times, as I swear by oil of ulay and my nain (gran) used just soap and water, but my skin hates oil! #firstworldproblems
1664 2018-09-29 19:38:10 I always get naked, oil myself up, and wrestle a goat. Your method seems so sterile in comparison.

1667 2018-09-29 19:37:45 “Scent? You mean my beard oil?”
1668 2018-09-29 19:37:43 Last season, the oil price was below 60 dollars. Some said, people won't get profit if the price below 70 dollar.
1669 2018-09-29 19:37:31 Its not the heart of winter but its cold enough to use some heat. I shall be dusting off my oil heater for my room

1672 2018-09-29 19:36:49 The garage smelled faintly of tire rubber and motor oil. Just how she liked it; it was calming to her.

Creeeeaaaaak.~

Finally, the last bolt in place, nice and tight.  Phew. Tossing her wrench aside for now, she'd reach down and push herself from under the kart, boots 》
1673 2018-09-29 19:36:37 all of NEB is captured by big oil. it wouldn't matter if the panel was made up of an environmentalist, an indigenous leader and an actual orca -- the result would be the same.

1678 2018-09-29 19:35:54 The tipping point is extremely close where voting will not be enough. As indoctrination takes hold, numbers of useful idiots grows, the idiots become impatient. Calls to abandon electoral college, chipping away rule of law, efforts to speed up process.

1682 2018-09-29 19:35:31 --to be Indian--

To be Indian these days are a higher struggle
For we love water not oil and we protect the land 
As we suffer to live right but the machines are trouble
So it's gonna be a battle to give the next generation to make a stand
1683 2018-09-29 19:35:30 Looks like a mining road to an oil or mineral mine
1684 2018-09-29 19:34:58 don't think many people accuse Kenney of being shy 

"Yet they appointed Ms. Berman as co-chair of the panel advising the Alberta Government on our oil sands". Kenney leaves out the part about it being wrt its CLP. guess he feels critics of the oil sands should not have a voice
1685 2018-09-29 19:34:56 Big oil at work..

1692 2018-09-29 19:34:19 Back in the 50's we were being told we would run out of oil in 10 years time, but not to worry, as there was an ice coming before then, that would wipe out mankind. Could someone pass the salt please - yawn yawn.

1694 2018-09-29 19:34:12 My wife came home and she was clearly upset. I asked her why. She said the car repairs were going to cost $2000.00. I had a look, it was an Oil leak and it was covered under warranty. When I asked about the scam at the repair shop you never saw such a bunch of ‘Angles’.

1700 2018-09-29 19:33:13 My sister in law and niece were just at the store buying olive oil and my niece asked if it was vodka. My sister in law said no and asked how she knew about vodka. My niece responded... "from aunt diz". Ooops.
1701 2018-09-29 19:33:12 LOL, mine suck, even when I get new ones. I’m off to get oil change and car wash so it’s sure to happen. Feel bad for those cities though.  Parts of Tijuana could be leveled w a bad storm.

1703 2018-09-29 19:32:58 Mayo threw Bad meat all on the motor oil!!!!
1704 2018-09-29 19:32:37 true, I didn’t think about how it’s processed! just depends on who it’s manufactured by and how they process the oil. it’s basically the luck of the draw. I wouldn’t either if I were you lol

1722 2018-09-29 19:29:23 I keep telling myself it costs to be the boss, but I just spent $42 on an oil change for a synthetic blend and oh boy am I not feeling bossy.
1723 2018-09-29 19:29:16 So 1.5 hours into waiting for AN OIL CHANGE... I ask how much longer. Guy says 15-20 more mins. It’s been 30 mins since then. I get that it’s the busy day of the week.. but I called ahead of time. I should not be waiting 2 hours for an oil change 
1724 2018-09-29 19:29:15 I was happy out here in AB that we voted away from them but now the downturn in the oil patch carbon tax and high fuel prices as well no progressive movement away from oil and gas to renewable energy they may weasel back in. I don't understand it.

1733 2018-09-29 19:26:50 Oil is a tiny portion of electrical generation, right? Grid batteries are a thing now, and solves the continuity issue. Once EVs are prevalent their batteries can be utilized as a virtual power plant to add more redundancy.
1734 2018-09-29 19:26:39 Ayyy I got my chores all done including an oil change for my beloved Golf. Now it’s vey happy and so am I. Skrrr skrrr  what’s up dudez

1737 2018-09-29 19:26:25 Makandiwa is NO prophet. Unless you know nothing abt prophecy. What has God to do with prophesying abt oil. All the oil from the middle East where are the prophecies. Stop being gullible.

Not good enough!!!’
1743 2018-09-29 19:25:56 With WTI/BRENT at multi year highs would be interesting TK know what micro cap sub £10m producers or very near term produces folk are looking at. 

Any market. 

Name them and give a short bullet point or two on the drivers.  

Small oil stocks don’t seem to have caught the move!
1744 2018-09-29 19:25:53 I would instead prefer to no longer need oil and instead use electricity or hydroelectricity technologie, and each day we come closer and closer from been able tu use this renewable technology in car. So i prefer to protect the environment thank you very much

Are we still in that "can't sell in USA?
1749 2018-09-29 19:25:35 A compulsive behaviour will clean everything from top to bottom. Constantly washing their hands. A spot of dirt on their shirt is enough to drive them in distress, a spot of oil spill enough to scrub the ground.
1750 2018-09-29 19:25:32 They justify climate inaction by assuming that the rest of the world will also burn all of the oil.  The investors behind all of this are counting on the rest of us accepting that assumption or their pipelines become worthless before they break even.  Who will be holding the bag?
1751 2018-09-29 19:25:25 I think Apple is already working with Blackberry on Autonomous cars since they hired Bob Mansfield. They could form a JV. Similar to GE Baker Hughes for oil.

1756 2018-09-29 19:24:23 I'd surmise that you suck at cooking so I don't want your fries. You probably don't know how to heat the oil properly. Nothing personal but I do believe that you suck at making food.

1759 2018-09-29 19:23:50 Few years ago we saw news report of oil bubbling at surface near DIK & Karak.Apparently prev federal govt was not giving NOCs for refineries, why cant we make state owned refinerythere.Also there is natural gas under outskirts of Peshawar. Wouldnt harvesting these reduce imports?
1760 2018-09-29 19:23:42 I feel yer family pain. 44 yesrs ago, Frank Zappa warned us about the gnawing evil tendencies inherent in audio-visual media as is the case with anything Man has ever created. I hope you will find some way to get through to him. It sounds biological. Try Hemp Oil+Ground Cinnamon?

1763 2018-09-29 19:23:02 Surplus in an emerging competitive market, hence competitive advantage will naturally favour the unregulated or less regulated market than the regulated one. US Shale Oil Production and OPEC counties are the two cased  scenarios.

1767 2018-09-29 19:22:38 So you cant see the joke. "The Many" do care that major species are becoming extinct. Ethically, Iceland has risen to that challenge, but Labour has not (thats the ethical point). Labour supporters queuing for ethical Palm oil free products? I think not.

1769 2018-09-29 19:22:24 seriously... depending how much you believe about his covering Dulles' ass over Nazi financing and oil cartels post-war, overseeing US naturalization of Nazis in the 50s, his McCarthyism, on top of everything else, there's a valid case that Nixon was the most evil POTUS ever.
1770 2018-09-29 19:22:19 A goal for me is to learn how to change my own oil instead of paying $79.99 every time

1773 2018-09-29 19:21:46 Look Prof. You will never convince these zealots. They can't follow your argument. These minerals were discovered centuries ago. You don't need prophecy unless you are a fool. There is nothing spiritual abt diamond and oil deposits. You need no prophecy.
1774 2018-09-29 19:21:39 I’ve never been to prison but I would imagine it’s equivalent to waiting for your car to get an oil change
1775 2018-09-29 19:21:38 It's @PepsiCo CEO @IndraNooyi's final week, but she still hasn't fixed Pepsi's #palmoil problem. I want her to save the #orangutans and leave a legacy free from #rainforest #deforestation & #workerabuse - by dropping palm oil villain @Indofood now!
1776 2018-09-29 19:21:29 Thanks @Team_Penster ! Current PBPB has to be @WholeEarthFood - no palm oil and not too sweet. Would recommend!!
1777 2018-09-29 19:21:09 Role of oil and housing as @mbusigin and I discussed a few days ago.  2013 had high, but stable oil prices driving capex higher and deeply depressed housing that “couldn’t get worse”.
1778 2018-09-29 19:21:08 It might be too late, but try chalk.  The chalk will absorb the oil.  Good luck!
1779 2018-09-29 19:20:46 I’m already off the oil
1780 2018-09-29 19:20:45 If you don’t need to, be grateful your skin doesn’t require it. I say that as a person who wakes up every morning with a peeling face covered in oil and white heads lol 
1781 2018-09-29 19:20:32 No. The world's Oil Richest Nations are still very poor - #Oil is a curse to #Venezuela
Oil has never been a blessing to #Nigeria either.

We we're doing extremely better before discovery of Black Gold.
1782 2018-09-29 19:20:21 Your pointing to things that are not party specific and have 0 to do with any political ideology. So far, I see economic incentive as being the motivating factor in the egregious acts, common to humans in general
1783 2018-09-29 19:20:03 Well. well well ...what a find,
1784 2018-09-29 19:19:57 I love oil pastels

1789 2018-09-29 19:19:13 Sorry what I was meaning to say is yes the price of oil will help to strengthen the CAD ( Loonie ) against the USD but I can see 1.275 down the road. Not Monday no.
1790 2018-09-29 19:19:09 i hope they pour mayonnaise in your rice and cooking oil in your maize meal tonight.

1793 2018-09-29 19:19:02 I usually use olive oil with smoked sea salt on steaks and the block definitely gave a saltier taste! Not too much or over-bearing bit you could definitely taste it.

1796 2018-09-29 19:18:34 The Poll Tax Riots were really bad. Also the country was almost brought to its knees by reduced output from a single oil refinery about 20 years ago.

1800 2018-09-29 19:17:55 Good news -- my car only cost me $30 to get my oil changed today.
Bad news -- I have to find a junkyard tire rim and patch a hole in my tire or else I have to replace the whole thing. Off to do some Googling.

1805 2018-09-29 19:17:31 I know who the Koch brothers are. And their bullshit Libertarian agenda. I blame them for Trumps thinking that climate change is a hoax. Awful selfish of disgustingly rich men to want to keep polluting because their money comes from oil. Their nanny was a Nazi sympathizer.
1806 2018-09-29 19:17:10 Price of Oil is lesser comparably in Delhi, perhaps to put some cool solace upon desperate leaders, whose pol party are at cross point of endangered one. Thanks to the long time anti india activities in finance, soci-cultural bindings by the endangered Parties since independence.
1807 2018-09-29 19:17:07 So . . . only men are capable of disagreement without yelling, crying, and calling women they don't like the C word?

Yeah, she should have thought this one out.

1810 2018-09-29 19:16:54 The only reason that is allowed to carry on is because of oil 

One day that will not be enough 

The biggest threat to that cult is alternative energy

 They threaten the globalist as well

They do not control their destiny 

Word powers will come together and destroy them

1831 2018-09-29 19:14:46 one interesting thing happening to me while living in a socialist country (or whatever this is) is that it tunes and deepens my reading analytical tools especially reading political social and economic books and also about oil geopolitics... just to make sense of all here..
1832 2018-09-29 19:14:39 She's right tho.
1833 2018-09-29 19:14:31 So oder so. Tesla hat die kritische Phase überstanden...glaube aber nicht, dass die sec sich durchsetzen wird. Musk ist nicht dumm...er wird schon zu überzeugen wissen. Big oil wird verlieren.
1834 2018-09-29 19:14:01 I sunk an oil tanker

1836 2018-09-29 19:13:53 calming practices (yoga/meditation), cbd oil, writing/reading, aromatherapy, or i like to paint because i feel in control when everything in my life is out of control. 
1837 2018-09-29 19:13:26 Climate change goes beyond politics ,it affects both livestock and plant farming ,it affects exploration of huge coal deposit dat we have in Nigeria which is more cheap 4 electricity generation,its affect demand for our crude oil as advanced count are tilting to renewables.

1841 2018-09-29 19:12:29 An oil magnate.......
1842 2018-09-29 19:12:27 The quantity increase in supply will only benefit the oil cos ... it depends on how much margin of profits the oil companies/subs want to make , whether or not prices at the pump will go up ;that plus consumer/commercial demand, and taxes
1843 2018-09-29 19:12:26 I like putting coconut oil on at night and I’ve just had a bo@b of emotions and now I don’t know if I’m crying tears or coconut oil... 
1844 2018-09-29 19:12:22 it’s basically vegetable oil that’s taken from peanuts but still. someone who’s mildly allergic might be able to eat it but someone who’s highly allergic should probably stay away for their own sake lol

1849 2018-09-29 19:11:37 Seems like a good one. Really excited to watch the Oil Kings with 2019 prospects Robertson and Alistrov and 2020 eligible Jake Neighbours (my favourite from the WHL for 2020). Also a few other guys who could get picked in the next 2 drafts.

1853 2018-09-29 19:11:14 Thank you @AllyiahsFace for always being gracious enough to give me credit for my hacks because that got2b and oil sheen on the lace trick spread all over YouTube as soon as my thread went viral and nobody gave me credit lol I ain't mad but its always good to be acknowledged

1855 2018-09-29 19:10:45 Take 2 at trying to eat something...steamed broccoli, lemon juice, Mrs. Dash, salt, drizzle of olive oil.  Wont lie, the first whiff of the Mrs. Dash made me step back, but the first bite wasn't too bad.  I'm trying though.

Pray for me that it stays down please.
1856 2018-09-29 19:10:35 Leaders will always attract many jealous vengeful eyes, let them fuel you to grind even harder so that you can inspire the next generation of leaders to follow in your footsteps.

1860 2018-09-29 19:10:04 Oil price has consistently risen above the budget benchmark, for 3 months.

Could someone ask @ProfOsinbajo and  @MBuhari  why we are still borrowing from China; and, further deepening future economic problems for the next generation?
1861 2018-09-29 19:10:00 Total cost of ownership AND total joy of knowing you don’t have to do another emissions test or another oil change or touch another gas pump.  (Or replace:  “timing belt”, rusted out exhaust system, spark plugs, brakes & rotors). Total joy to wake up each day to a full charge.
1862 2018-09-29 19:09:55 Sir I complained to your helpline but not helping....I'm sure you can help for your telenor network not working in my area johi dadu in laudshading electicity...why. i think tawar  have no More oil..... You please repear this.... Thanks
1863 2018-09-29 19:09:48 Skillet-fried some leftover squash in coconut oil. A few carrots and a leftover leek top, too. Having that with hard-boiled eggs and a bit of mild cheddar. I fear to mention the kale I tossed in the skillet. It's bitter summer kale. Can't wait for sweet winter greens.
1864 2018-09-29 19:09:33 Ooooh the new oil isn’t so just
1865 2018-09-29 19:09:30 I've been hearing great things about masturbating with coconut oil. Ah fuck, wrong twitter account!
1866 2018-09-29 19:09:04 Yoruba people don’t joke with pepper and oil....
1867 2018-09-29 19:08:53 Why worry about Pluckers parking when you can get an oil change next door?
1868 2018-09-29 19:08:50 Interesting difference bt. 2000 and 2008 where the last one seems only to be a trailer of the first partly as a result of the low interest regime. I remember the late 60` downturn, today only the oil crisis of 74 is remembered. Artificially low interests sow the seeds of busts.
1869 2018-09-29 19:08:48 Last summer in Palm Springs iI had some hummus at a Greek restaurant that was mind blossoming. I suspect the olive oil was the secret, and can add all sorts of additional amazeballs.
1870 2018-09-29 19:08:38 I was at a conference last year where a guy was explaining why it was completely safe for someone allergic to peanuts to eat foods fried in the oil. I was like nah fam but I haven’t tried it yet (ima need that epi). Buuuut yeah the fries are fried in different oil so that’s g2g!
1871 2018-09-29 19:08:19 It's always genes. All we really need is olive oil & vaseline. Everything else is marketing to make us feel better if we use it & make a lot of money.
1872 2018-09-29 19:08:10 Recently I was followed by @JonProbyArt a brilliant intellect and the most talented oil painter I have encountered. Give the man a like and follow on here and Instagram. The art is excellent.
1873 2018-09-29 19:07:45 Whilst crude oil is still sold in US dollars, the US can pretty much run a deficit indefinitely with few consequences.
1874 2018-09-29 19:07:35 I mean, possibly

It's called "fry" because when it has the distinct quality of "bubbles" popping randomly, like oil in a frying pan, because you're not exerting enough muscular control for your voice to come out smoothly

It also used to be called "popcorning"
1875 2018-09-29 19:07:24 The whole of the U.S. is addicted, addicted to oil, addicted to burning fossil fuels, addicted to war, addicted to organized stalking.
1876 2018-09-29 19:07:18 I’ll remember to bring some baby oil.
1877 2018-09-29 19:07:12 Came close but only well after the bulk of the shock was in the rearviewmirror. 
In a lot of ways, 2015/16 recession or not is irrelevant. Risk sold off, much of economy hit the skids b/c capital-intensive sectors were exposed to oil and China/EM. Rest of economy weathered storm
1878 2018-09-29 19:06:56 My understanding was Chinese (post 2008) were bribed from doing this with low oil prices and filling of domestic SPR in order to stabilize global economy and US domestic economy.  Now being used against them
1879 2018-09-29 19:06:34 I have tried soap& water and kind man in restaurant in Harrogate have me lemons, not at home so cooking oil will have to wait! some might come off in the shower, TY X

1886 2018-09-29 19:06:06 If you read this, then you like the smell of dirty socks soaked in fish oil, covered in wet dog hair.
1887 2018-09-29 19:06:03 That was an interesting one to watch. I was more sad when Sarah Lynn died. Which I watched today while get an oil change lol.
1888 2018-09-29 19:05:33 Vladimir Alistrov, who went 2nd overall in the 2018 CHL Import Draft to the Edmonton Oil Kings, is going to be a player to watch this year.

The Belorussian forward is big at 6-foot-2, he hits a really impressive top gear in full flight and can make some nifty plays with the puck
1889 2018-09-29 19:05:22 Green olives, black olives, olive oil, olive juice, olive leaves, etc.
1890 2018-09-29 19:05:03 Bravo! Canning? Save some for dinner. A little olive oil and garlic with those and it smells like my childhood.
1891 2018-09-29 19:04:56 See if the #1 guy is free to change your oil.
1892 2018-09-29 19:04:36 You still employ that coconut oil woman?
1893 2018-09-29 19:04:29 Uncertainty around the edges, sure - will the warmer water cause more hurricanes or will strong westerlies prevent that? (for example)

We know it's happening and we know why it's happening. And so did the oil companies.
1894 2018-09-29 19:04:21 Gotta get a oil change and a alignment

1900 2018-09-29 19:03:19 Seeing an attack against a righteous man of God like Judge Kavanaugh is indeed disturbing.  “For the lips of an immoral woman are as sweet as honey and her mouth is  smoother than oil. But in the end she is as bitter as poison, as  dangerous as a double-edged sword.” - Proverbs 5
1901 2018-09-29 19:02:43 She can get a GoFundMe, perjure herself and change her story. Either one can.
But Ford's account of event and the denial of her friend cannot both be true no matter what her friend believes. It is illogical
1902 2018-09-29 19:02:21 I’m having an oil change for my car early today..and my Service Advisor for my car just texted me asking- if I need anything and just reply..I replied - “Breakfast-I’m only kidding”...

1910 2018-09-29 19:00:43 Travelers must comply w/ federal law on transporting marijuana & cannabis infused products, such as CBD oil, on board a flight. Our officers are required to notify law enforcement officers if they discover these products while screening.
1911 2018-09-29 19:00:28 everything is covered in truffle oil & some foamy shit
1912 2018-09-29 19:00:23  "Oil Tot"! It's so sexy to see that you enjoy being a "Quickie"! It beats my heart at a rate that makes me want to scream "Ok heart attack will you just start already so I can go back to playing Mario Kart". You were fast in your AHS! Cram a 3rd for your enjoyment!

1918 2018-09-29 18:59:33 East and West Germany had approximately the same natural resources, the Koreas have approximately the same resources. Venezuela is sitting on top of one of the biggest oil reserves in the world and Chile only has copper. The resource argument doesn’t hold
1919 2018-09-29 18:59:28 Coconut oil darling
1920 2018-09-29 18:59:19 I came for the oil change and oil change only. Save all them “I see that you also need....” statements.
1921 2018-09-29 18:59:17 “Data is the new oil” why can’t I personally make money off my data and my content? Why does Facebook get to?
1922 2018-09-29 18:58:53 I don’t use lube. I foreplay long enough  to get our genitals nice and wet before penetration. Also I like alternating between fucking and eating my bottom out and lube taste gross. Coconut oil is an amazing alternative !
1923 2018-09-29 18:58:52 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
1924 2018-09-29 18:58:44 @Scottymechanic I have a 2008 Toyota Solera SLE that just hit 40,000 miles. Oil changes performed every 5000 miles using synthetic at the dealer and all of the other fluids changed within the last two years, also by the dealer. My question is:

1931 2018-09-29 18:57:50 I listened to it on Thursday. Listening to @1MickyHazard & @GrahamRoberts4 was a complete eyeopener.
As I told Micky, with the way he described the New Spurs Stadium, he could sell oil to the Arabs. 
So many topics covered.

1941 2018-09-29 18:56:59 Oil drilling, transportation, refining, transportation, storing, pumping and losses already cost more energy than is needed for propelling EV for about the same distance as the fuel that's prepared with that energy! Talk about efficiency

1952 2018-09-29 18:55:53 BTW, I’m not stating oil sands emissions *should* increase, much less to the 100 MT cap.

I hope that as many countries as possible, including Canada, meet Paris commitments.

1969 2018-09-29 18:52:53 Carbon pricing will also make the most marginal production uneconomic. Where that marginal point is, of course, depends on the price of oil. Which, in turn, depends significantly on demand. A carbon price will cause some reduction in demand (greater over long run).

1970 2018-09-29 18:52:47 I don’t even understand your tweet but it sounds like befitting ‘abuse’ for an utterly, brainless nitwit
I remember the rubbish he was spouting “ndi Igbo for Buhari 2019, then Buhari for ndi Igbo 2023”... biggest scam ever
He was selling it like an insincere snake oil salesman
1971 2018-09-29 18:52:36 Wow…sunflower oil is incredibly bad stuff for people to be eating. Good job security though?
1972 2018-09-29 18:52:36 I prepared shimp 
I used a non stick frying pan
While it was still cold I added olive oil and chopped garlic
Heated the pan
When the garlic was half-cooked I added the shelled shrimp and covered the pan with a lid
I cooked at a medium heat for 15 minutes
Garnished with parsley
1973 2018-09-29 18:52:35 Hmm...is it, REAL olive oil? I get the Ines in the brine.
1974 2018-09-29 18:52:31 If u drink aquafina u might as well blend up some swisher sweet guts and some motor oil as a chaser since that’s how u choose to live.

1977 2018-09-29 18:52:17 It's clear you hold senators in high esteem. I think they are snake oil salesmen. I feel the same about judges, to be honest.
1978 2018-09-29 18:52:02 He doesn't remove them from twitter, asshat. Two different things. Twitter is denying me the ability to hear free speech. Can't wait until the same treatment used on Standard Oil is applied.
1979 2018-09-29 18:51:50 I'm getting sick of the trendiness of CBD oil. Yes it's natural, yes it looks promising, but please do not be touting it as some kind of medicine for uses it is not approved for. Be careful with your brain.
1980 2018-09-29 18:51:43 For all those planning to vote QS, I recommend staying home. U r wasting your vote on snake oil salesmen promising a false Utopia. Dont be fooled #quebec2018

1983 2018-09-29 18:50:51 IRAN HAS THE SAME AMOUNT OF OIL AS SAUDI ARABIA. THE DISTRIBUTION OPEN UP IN UNITED NATIONS THATS HOLDING IT AND GIVE CONTRACTS DISTRIBUTION TO MOST COUNTRIES. IRAN WILL BE GOOD TO THEIR PEOPLE ARABS.
1984 2018-09-29 18:50:29 But gas companies change prices twice or more a day, and by district and region. Oct. Nov. Dec. are the same reporting quarter, so there needn't be much if any reported profit hit. Oil people I know are not yuuuge Trump fans though.
1985 2018-09-29 18:50:24 have you ever wanted to deep fry basically anything and make it taste like hot dogs just use oil you fried smoked wings in
1986 2018-09-29 18:50:20 Great to see you smiling and that you’re making a good recovery,Amelia.
Bio oil is really useful for  scars. 
1987 2018-09-29 18:50:17 Oh, no. I did oil painting for a year and that take a crap ton of time.
1988 2018-09-29 18:50:16 Yes. It was the Argan oil one and they said I couldn't have it. I could only have the ones in the picture. I explained the terms and conditions and they said no.
1989 2018-09-29 18:50:14 You tell me how you refute something that never happened, if saying it didnt happen is not good enough. Provide video or documentation of a non event?

2011 2018-09-29 18:48:13 Too narrow of a window to have an impact on gaze prices (plus, all oil is sold ahead of time, there is always a lag between production output & prices)
2012 2018-09-29 18:48:02 I didn't not say that Heid ! Tiny did !
2013 2018-09-29 18:48:00 Essential oils (esp lavender oil) helps so much. I either put the oil near my nose or spray myself with a lavender spray. Scent is the most instant sense so it will give you instant relief. Also, try to avoid caffeine and too much sugar. Sprite, some teas, water, etc are good!
2014 2018-09-29 18:47:25 Is it damaging the auto industry which is 99% dependant on oil and contributes the same amount to total pollution load?
2015 2018-09-29 18:47:22 Yes - but there are Muskbros who manage the feat of admiring both- perhaps focused more on SpaceX/Iron Man fantasies.  I despise $TSLA especially because of this parallel and the cults around rotten personalities plus demagoguery/snake oil sales.  Plenty of $TSLAQ who disagree.
2016 2018-09-29 18:47:19 No, expectations of future supply play a huge roll in oil & gasoline prices. If medium-to-long-term supply is suddenly boosted, oil companies start to unload inventories. It's not just the extra oil that's pulled out of the ground that's sold at a cheaper. It's stockpiles, too.

2041 2018-09-29 18:43:46 It doesn’t matter who says it. The human and material cost of assured oil supply to ensure we continue to burn gasoline in our cars - already vastly subsidizes the ICE car industry. This has to end especially now that we have alternatives.
2042 2018-09-29 18:43:45 Which brand of black soap you use? I tried the African kind and it dryer my face out so bad, I thought it was burning off and also which coconut oil you use?
2043 2018-09-29 18:43:35 I'm not disapproving anything, political parties in the European Union buy votes for flour and sun-flower oil, you mean to tell me this stuff doesn't happen in Iran tenfold? I don't believe it, you can claim o/wise I don't believe it
2044 2018-09-29 18:43:25 @RitzCrackers is one of the brands that are still buying dirty palm oil from rainforest destroyers! The first step to stop deforestation is to stop working with companies like Wilmar. #DropDirtyPalmOi
2045 2018-09-29 18:43:22 #Midterms2018 is one issue  #Sanctions on #Iranian oil coming into effect on NOV. 4th is another. Saudi oil minister's recent messages suggest US and #Saudis don't agree on timing of increased production. This is entirely in #Pompeo's court...

2048 2018-09-29 18:43:00 I'm pretty sure oil futures will cause the adjustment to happen right away. As long as the Saudi promise to increase production is seen as credible by the markets (that I believe is a big if...).
2049 2018-09-29 18:42:47 They very clearly just put salt and caraway on an ordinary hamburger bun with a little (a lot of) oil to make it stick. #gross
2050 2018-09-29 18:42:41 But they sure "demarketed" that brand. It's assumed that a truck belonging to Forte oil. At least they collected a percentage from that company before they could register as part of their brand name.
2051 2018-09-29 18:42:34 I just spent $70 on a damn oil change I’m annoyed asf !

2059 2018-09-29 18:41:51 Russia wants to be able to tap into its vast reserve and needs Trump to lift sanctions in order to get to that oil.  Once again, it all boils down to how much $$ can be stuffed into personal pockets first.

2066 2018-09-29 18:41:19 Why are you so paranoid?

Growth in Aviation sector is an indication of the secular growth story of the economy. 

Crude oil prices are headed north and so prices will rise, demand will fall. 

Without growth in airport infrastructure, how can air traffic spike?

2084 2018-09-29 18:38:56 Of course the NMC in a one year deal is good for Oil as it limits waiver risk if they move him to AHL for a stretch, which he and agent agreed is something they'd consider.
2085 2018-09-29 18:38:38 have you tried soap and a fingernail brush? Next would be lemon juice. Finally vegetable oil and then back to soap and water.
2086 2018-09-29 18:38:37 Why did you say it was crap and you rubbished it 2015? 2015 you said it was crap, you never mentioned the 1950s. If he didn't know about the oil, definately he did prophecy baba. The truth is you forgot what you said, wawela nje ngokuzenza isazi, sakubamba

2095 2018-09-29 18:36:50 Car repair places are strange. Tires everywhere, the smell of oil, golf on the TV, yet @ArianaGrande kindly reminds us that God is a Woman from above.
2096 2018-09-29 18:36:48 The oil industry has to stop the politically correct game, they let these people in and handcuff themselves.
2097 2018-09-29 18:36:36 If the 1/4 mark comes (20 games) and this lineup isn't working, I think there will be bigger changes than just replacing a dman. This team really needs a strong start from day 1, which is part of the reason why using two young players on D would be so interesting.

2103 2018-09-29 18:36:17 Perhaps the 1979 oil price hike was the last gasp of the NIEO? However, I don't remember how the NIEO played out in the 70s. It could have been dead by then. I'll check what happened in Cancun.

2110 2018-09-29 18:35:27 UNO officers are more interested in oil deals with #PaulBiya at the expense of human lives.  @theresa_may government signed gas deal with dictator Biya while he kills young men on a daily basis in Southern Cameroons aka Ambazonia.
2111 2018-09-29 18:35:18 Just take Tesla private now!  The SEC probably has funding by big oil to try to stop the revolution you had started.  However they aren't taking Newton's 1st Law into consideration.  Inertia always wins!  BTW the Model S is an AMAZING car!
2112 2018-09-29 18:35:11 Wooooow how about alll latttt shit comes included I only go to Walmart too get my oil changed it’s $45 they check my fluids, check my tire pressure if it’s low they put air in it & vacuum my car that nigga so trifling for that..shit ridiculous
2113 2018-09-29 18:35:10 I wonder why an oil producing state like Delta with billions of IGR will be owing salaries. Politics aside, this is bad, condemnable & Deltans must speak in 2019 with their PVCs. Let's break the jinx & develop Delta. Warri, Sapele, Agbor, Oleh & even Kwale are all in ruins, haba!
2114 2018-09-29 18:35:06 Oh, I forgot to mention rosehip oil. If I had to choose only one beauty product, that would be it. It’s incredible.
2115 2018-09-29 18:34:50 Your preoccupation with Ms Berman’s appointment is bordering obsession. Her answer isn’t “protestations” it’s fact. She was appointed at the recommendation of oil & gas CEOs as a counterpoint. Let it go. #abpoli #cdnpoli
2116 2018-09-29 18:34:50 wher should i go to get an oil change at?
2117 2018-09-29 18:34:49 Batman buying from big oil and not going full electric just shows he’s a capitalistic fraud. #sad

2119 2018-09-29 18:34:46 @realDonaldTrump I do not need to repeat this issue every day, your government has promised, and Iran's oil exports will reach zero by November 4, and it will certainly reach.
2120 2018-09-29 18:34:35 The hoppers above the block of slums were the color of motor oil, desolate but uncaring.
2121 2018-09-29 18:34:26 Castor oil
2122 2018-09-29 18:34:26 That just goes to show that even CEOs in the oil industry feel the need to keep their critics close. I’m pretty sure there aren’t many of them that endorse Ms.B’s ultimate vision for the future of oil industry in Alberta.
2123 2018-09-29 18:34:21 @realDonaldTrump I have already talked about oil prices and a small fee that they can look at my tweets. Exempting oil sanctions is unacceptable and we will never accept such a thing.

2132 2018-09-29 18:33:20 My truck is leaking roughly a quart of oil every 300 miles which means it’s changing itself twice between each actual oil change

2137 2018-09-29 18:32:25 Thank you so much. This digital painting was based on my analog drawing with oil & acrylic paints and ball-point pens.
2138 2018-09-29 18:32:22 & where is the oil going 
2139 2018-09-29 18:32:19 Liberals believe that if we do away with oil, gas and coal we could all live our lives like the utopian TV show 'Little House on the Prairie.' Naive to say the least.

2143 2018-09-29 18:31:39 What happens to Hazard's goal on Wednesday.
2144 2018-09-29 18:31:35 Don't see the relevance. All three countries suffer from corruption, civil wars, and elderly infrastructure. Not to mention Venezuela, which has the world's largest oil reserves and is an economic/governance basket case.
2145 2018-09-29 18:31:26 Give over will ya!
2146 2018-09-29 18:31:25 Crude oil prices is just one component of what sets price at pump but a substantial one. My personal observation is that firms raise price much faster when crude rises and fall much slower with crude price falls. Not sure Trump’s an Econ genius on oil supply chain.

2151 2018-09-29 18:29:49 You are pretending to have a brain while proving you don't: if the oil deposits were known to be there a long time, as I pointed out today, then of course the prophet was lying when he purported to be making a new prophecy in 2015. Wake up!
2152 2018-09-29 18:29:25 Zimbabwe has oil deposits that's what is important
2153 2018-09-29 18:28:48 Thanks! Out of my comfort zone at the moment :( back to the fray tomorrow, refit the oil pump and see if we can get a start.

2156 2018-09-29 18:28:24 @larrywasslen likes the idea of "keeping it in the ground" and that pretty much says it all - literally communists and the US funded Sierra club working against our national interests to export oil but not foreign oil imports. Fin.

2171 2018-09-29 18:25:58 he just wants the liberal states to have more power. all liberals soften their means this way to gain support.

2173 2018-09-29 18:25:52 Those green energy items are anything but green.
Turbines are filled with at least 100 gallons of oil each that must be changed regularly. They catch fire, their bases are concrete leeching lime, solar panels contain mercury

2180 2018-09-29 18:24:57 There is no NoKo policy.  Removing the individual mandate cost everyone else more in premiums.  Keystone Pipeline isn't an accomplishment unless you own oil stock, gas prices are up.  Net neutrality is only good for large corporations and bad for small business.  Tax cuts are BS.

2228 2018-09-29 18:20:25 Oil accounts for about 87% of Saudi budget revenues, 90% of export earnings, and 42% of GDP. Tesla seems like an odd hedge.

2233 2018-09-29 18:19:32 Used to work with oil traders. Oil price shock now = little eff. gas prices for midterms. Refinery turnover is weeks, surplus thot temp partially arb’d via storage (some floating). +Midwest more exposed to WTI. Doesn’t mean they didn’t try, but $1.50 gad for midterms unlikely.
2234 2018-09-29 18:19:32 @UrbalActiv @BizNasty2point0 is the website going to restock? I need to purchase some oil!!

2238 2018-09-29 18:18:51 I've found that you can usually peel the label off of a noisy fan, somtimes there's a rubber washer under, then you put a bit of light oil in there, put it back together, it may run quietly for as long as 72 hours

2245 2018-09-29 18:18:08 my cars getting its first oil change, I’m not cryin
2246 2018-09-29 18:18:07 What proportion of domestic oil production actually receives WCS vs WTI?  Isn't the discount a boon for domestic crude buyers? The lack of pipeline capacity has the same effects as an export quota. No?
2247 2018-09-29 18:18:03 Don’t forget oil of some kind

2260 2018-09-29 18:15:47 Very well said. Bear is simply not good enough yet to play 82 games in a critical role on a team that MUST win now for people to keep their jobs. He is at best 1 year away.

2263 2018-09-29 18:15:15 WEEKEND SPECIAL: PENNE with BROCCOLI & SAUSAGE …Penne Pasta tossed with Garlic, Olive Oil, Broccoli Rapi & Sauce topped with Pecorino Cheese
2264 2018-09-29 18:14:48 Hm, why don’t I ever buy waterproof mascara? It’ll just come off with coconut oil. Then you miss your eyelashes and rememebr really quick 
2265 2018-09-29 18:14:47 As politely as possible - 

Both the Democrats and Republicans are big government parties. If the Republicans were for small government, they;d be for reduced military budget & oil subsidies, less interventionism, & wouldn't come within a mile of abortion, marriage, or religion.
2266 2018-09-29 18:14:44 It also assumes without basis that oil companies would actually pass on any savings to consumers.
2267 2018-09-29 18:14:42 For chrissakes dude, I'm saying burning oil for fuel is different from using it for plastic, that it's (currently) impossible to escape the use of hydrocarbons without isolating oneself, & doing so would do nothing to solve the problem. Not my fault if you can't figure that out.
2268 2018-09-29 18:14:40 My mom bought body soap infused with hemp oil, lol she don’t event know
2269 2018-09-29 18:14:30 Ladies and Gentlemen... the service department at the new Bruce Honda just completed its first oil change and over in sales we sold our first new!!! #brucehonda #thebigstore #adayoffirsts
2270 2018-09-29 18:14:28 I have medical oil and dry mainly used at night to put me to sleep the daytime is basically no THC. Just CBD. all terms I’m just learning
2271 2018-09-29 18:14:11 I fully agree US, UK and France trained Salafi Jihadis against secular stable Syria even though Syria had nothing to do with Sep 11- this was done to control oil, check Iran and for Golan heights. But Syria should also stop evil Iran Mullah regime stop its interference in Syria.
2272 2018-09-29 18:14:02 I dropped my car off at 10 am for an oil change and the man talking about he’s not gonna be finish until 6 .....sir I would’ve went some where else
2273 2018-09-29 18:13:50 On behalf of Christians, thank you for the support! We need to stop listening to these females. Proverbs 5:“For the lips of an immoral woman are as sweet as honey and her mouth is smoother than oil. But in the end she is as bitter as poison, as dangerous as a double-edged sword.”
2274 2018-09-29 18:13:43 Not to forget that there is no research on its psychological and physical aspects - because in most cases it also translates to immobility
2275 2018-09-29 18:13:28 The Oil will make the playoffs, IMO.  That being said, Wyshynski’s opinion doesn’t mean much to me.
2276 2018-09-29 18:13:23 Usually when oil price goes up gas prices surge instantly but when oil price goes down it takes months to see a drop in gas prices. Oil companies habitually gouge us. So this kind of conspiracy would require domestic gas companies to cooperate.
2277 2018-09-29 18:13:22 We've got the 3rd biggest spend out of all champions league clubs since Fergie. Only behind oil clubs

2281 2018-09-29 18:13:13 You always want to "make life better" for Britons, at the cost of the life of Biafrans, who Britain must murder in genocide because of OIL AND GAS. The curse upon the satanic Britain remains irreversible and irrevocable. Britain is doomed.

2284 2018-09-29 18:13:03 Also let’s for forget the struggle the water protectors are battling the oil industry with gains, OccupyICE, also #Rojava is the most revolutionary thing to happen since the EZLN; there’s over 3 million people living there since 2014.

2287 2018-09-29 18:12:09 Dear rahul sir you should talk to America to remove sanctions from iran and siriya so that international market price of oil can cool down
2288 2018-09-29 18:12:05 @CIA you guys owe Liberals a bonfire for MLK Jr. , if Kavanaugh found out..

2297 2018-09-29 18:11:08 We hit a moose in 2017 and apparently the dealership the insurance liked put on old parts and on top of that our brakes need replacing, need tires, alignment, oil change.. and pretty sure there's more but my bf hasn't said it all.
2298 2018-09-29 18:11:00 *huff* I've had the RAM up on ramps for a few hours to cool down for an oil change. The moment I set hoof outside to change the oil, it starts to rain. Thanks Mother Nature.

At last there is some good news. Here the petrol price has dropped by 2 pence per litre due to oil prices dropped on international markets.However Diesel price remains the same.Hope this happens there soon..

2304 2018-09-29 18:10:29 Gasoline prices r influenced by many factors other than global crude oil prices. 1 major factor is refinery capacity. 1 thing is certain though: high oil prices means more jobs in red state USA. Lower oil prices means job losses in USA. TX should be very angry at Trump right now.

2307 2018-09-29 18:10:17 It is the partnership of big gov and big biz that is so toxic.

Google or Standard Oil are perfect examples of why we also do not want limitless corporate hierarchies. 

A better educated and involved citizenry is needed.  And under leftist governments wr have the opposite.

2317 2018-09-29 18:09:03 Has anyone seen the extra virgin olive oil commercial by @AldiUSA? The one with the adult man in the toddler seat and his mother is wheeling him throughout the store. Stroking his hair. Seems a bit perverse to me. This pediphia thing has to stop. There’s nothing normal about it!

2326 2018-09-29 18:07:35 my social anxiety is probably the worst when i have to take my car in for maintenance. not only is mysogyny rampant but they expect an answer for every question in .2 seconds and jfc I'd rather just change my own oil if I don't have to put up with the goddamn attitude
2327 2018-09-29 18:07:31 CBD oil works amazingly well.
2328 2018-09-29 18:07:23 I would suggest you look for Canadian stats. Alberta forces producers to conserve and not vent. We are way ahead of the US. Again hypocritical of activists to protest Canadian oil and not other countries.
2329 2018-09-29 18:07:12 What was happening with equities around a quarter back is what happening with commodities and currencies right now, especially Crude Oil and INR. Those who are long, will get sorted out by the general equilibrium phenomena.

2353 2018-09-29 18:03:46 Trump cries of "wolf" to Salman will lose its efficacy sooner or later. But Saudis are likely to make statements to the press that oil supply is plentiful and that will bring the oil price down. US refinery run rates that will be down about 1 MBD buys time.

2370 2018-09-29 18:01:02 Keep in mind that exceptions can be made when it comes to #flavored oils, given that even the "purest" flavored oil can't technically be labeled "extra virgin" due to the #infusion of other #ingredients, but shopping with reputable companies is always the safest bet! #OliveOil
2371 2018-09-29 18:01:02 To truly take advantage of all the #healthbenefits that olive oil has to offer, it's important to choose a higher #quality of oil.

2373 2018-09-29 18:01:02 I studied art history in college (it was my minor).

2384 2018-09-29 18:00:16 The RAF used to do things like running flood relief operations in Somalia.  Now they're just oil mercenaries.  It's such a disgrace to my family history.
2385 2018-09-29 18:00:12 Thanks to the Previous PC government and not diversifying from oil and not contributing to the heritage trust fund, we are in this situation! So how will you return to balance with out neglecting on services? Where is your shadow budget?

Even someone who doesn't know much about cars has to take driving tests, maintain a license and should know to change the oil and fill it with gas. We give babies tablets, for pete's sake.

2421 2018-09-29 17:54:23 If anyone wonders what my fav porn is. Its oil

Girls pouring gallons of oil on their bodies. Guys shinning like gods. Fun. 

I like bi too. But only if guys fuck everyone. I'm talking dick in all the asses and pussies. 

I rarely watch porn. Reminds me of my work.

2426 2018-09-29 17:53:49 It's a football club who have spent the 3rd most in the world since Ferguson left and only behind oil clubs. 
It says a lot about our so called best manager in the world when the only way he can build a team is by buying 29 year olds and outspending everyone else
2427 2018-09-29 17:53:36 An oil change and a car wash will have you feeling like you’re driving a brand new car.
2428 2018-09-29 17:53:34 Pointless convo with anti-trans people earlier made me feel absolutely rubbish. Deactivated FB for a bit, have just taken child to the park and then checked the car oil and now I feel better. Time for some pro-queer plotting with a good friend. #UppaQueers
2429 2018-09-29 17:53:30 That’s a valid question why people care more about Israel than Saudi Arabia. I personally think it has to do with a lack of knowledge on the latter/more media focus on Israel’s human rights abuses. Not to be cynical, but Saudi Arabia’s oil also benefits US consumption habits...
2430 2018-09-29 17:53:10 Cause they don't use pure Spanish olive oil!
2431 2018-09-29 17:52:55 Like seriously?
What you have other than oil?
2432 2018-09-29 17:52:53 อยากได้ค่าา
2433 2018-09-29 17:52:25 Still have time to get that oil changed and car washed.

2445 2018-09-29 17:50:03 I believe all of the failed fish oil studies over the years is one of the reasons that Vascepa will be a blockbuster drug.  You can’t get this OTC and physicians know this when prescribing.
2446 2018-09-29 17:49:55 Oil changes are so expensive wtf
2447 2018-09-29 17:49:52 Clearly SEC is influenced by the oil companies

2451 2018-09-29 17:49:38 Also, 3000 dead in 9/11. How did the Osamas had the money to finance it? Oh right, we bought oil from them. And at least 10'000 killed in Yemen. How the Saudis pay for weapons? Oil. When we're using a system this bloodstained, little else should scare us.

2455 2018-09-29 17:49:25 You are welcome,let me know how it goes!...ohh and lastly,I use Environ nourishing oil from Sorbet daily,makes the vag feel like a baby’s bum.But don’t use when you know he’ll be eating you up,it doesn’t taste nice.
2456 2018-09-29 17:49:13 Exhaust the in-house options before going out and finding one that equals giving up an asset. If they’re in tight I bet there’s a move at the 1/4 mark. In the mean time, they’ve done well in camp, see what happens when the games really mean something
2457 2018-09-29 17:49:00 like if i was on set and they was like Thaddeus throw this on, i would politely be asked to be lathered in coconut oil 
2458 2018-09-29 17:48:59 I'll oil me bat.
2459 2018-09-29 17:48:48 Maybe something with calcium, phosphorus and magnesium will help? Walking maybe too. I use ginger oil with arnica montana gel on my legs when they get really tired/achey. The ginger is uplifting as well as anti inflammatory and compliments the arnica. 
2460 2018-09-29 17:48:45 @GG_RMC @EPhilippePM @EmmanuelMacron libre circulation des biens et des personnes avec un litre du gaz oil à 1.70€" qui peut circuler, les riches qui prennent l'avion pour acheter à l'étranger ! Les français ne se déplace même plus à 50km pour faire leur courses
2461 2018-09-29 17:48:32 But my point is not to bore you, just to suggest an opening where this debate is not foreclosed. I don’t have the answers
2462 2018-09-29 17:48:25 I came to get my oil changed and I see them airing my tires up , cleaning my windows and vacuuming my car..

2465 2018-09-29 17:47:25 Great article, Canadian governments must do whatever’s needed to break Canada’s oil transport bottlenecks.
2466 2018-09-29 17:47:21 tru but even then she is exercising agency and being vocal despite wearing a burqa. it complicates stereotypes of women being submissive but also puts the mullah apparatus in a woman's hands
2467 2018-09-29 17:47:14 of course but I'm also cognizant of the reality many ppl can relate not just to IK's politics but also Bushra's burqa - what do we have to give them in return? if we r to build a left populism - what will criticizing her burqa achieve?
2468 2018-09-29 17:46:54 You know what.... I’ve made it this far........ i think my cat doesn’t need oil it’s one of those
2469 2018-09-29 17:46:46 Let me stop fucking around and do this damn oil change in my Jeep...I bought the oil 2 weeks ago smh

2472 2018-09-29 17:46:37 2.55 in Texas, that is outrageous since we are not exporting oil
2473 2018-09-29 17:46:33 Sorry. I thought you meant one as the NHL 7D and sitting in the press box. Both need 20 minutes of ice time a game to develop. Cannot use nhl at 7 minutes to develop. Best option is to add one year to the draft age so that AHL is an option.
2474 2018-09-29 17:46:29 I jus be wanting somebody to sell me thc oil so i can smoke my pen all day long. It’s literally every blue moon anybody in Slidell has them. Unless I’m jus not in the know. Lol
2475 2018-09-29 17:45:53 I hate getting my oil changed. Idk wtf they talking about
2476 2018-09-29 17:45:29 Yeah, loads of coconut oil and keep them moving
2477 2018-09-29 17:45:08 Finally got that oil change I have been saying I need for the past month now 
2478 2018-09-29 17:44:52 I can get oil at the local smoke shop here but I usually get the vape-able kind online
2479 2018-09-29 17:44:45 I wonder if killing Northern Gateway and Energy East, along with the purchase of TMX (with no hope of it being built) were part of the govt’s Paris plan? Cooling development of the oil sands to meet unrealistic targets? Bill C-69 makes sense when looked at through that lens.

2481 2018-09-29 17:44:32 @Netflix not sure what i was expecting to watch as I sat waiting for an oil change, but #holdthedark surely made that time worth while #wow
2482 2018-09-29 17:44:31 Very well said.
2483 2018-09-29 17:44:25 I thot its oil painting
2484 2018-09-29 17:43:59 Long taxed Standard Oil ten dollars for each barrel they pumped in Louisiana and then gave them back 90% of it under the table #tor
2485 2018-09-29 17:43:47 prob too late for this now, but conditioner/water works as makeup remover & baby oil, too
2486 2018-09-29 17:43:31 Lol it really isn't greasy. It is cooked up fresh , with local ingredients. I'm sure they have to oil up a bit , but you can't tell. If it's greasy , I won't eat it. 
Especially the home fries potatoes.
2487 2018-09-29 17:43:30 Now if only we could approve projects getting our oil to global markets, we’d have some leverage at the table based on our discounted rates selling to the US
2488 2018-09-29 17:43:19 "I was going to buy beard oil, but I got distracted by a meme" is possibly the most hipster millennial thing I've said all year.
2489 2018-09-29 17:42:58 With butter, coconut oil, and heavy whipping cream 
2490 2018-09-29 17:42:34 “You’re needed an oil change 17000 miles ago...” yeah the lights been on since July mind your business
2491 2018-09-29 17:42:31 I thought it would be.  The oil does sit on top in eerily fashion but it taste great and it's good for you. I'm trying to change my diet and add MORE omega 3,6,9 to my diets. Apparently this does that. I was pleasantly surprised this morning. 
2492 2018-09-29 17:42:16 Best revenge against mansplainers is to leave two of them stuck together & deprive them of captive female audience they desperately claim.
2493 2018-09-29 17:42:05 Guys get so impressed when i say i work on my jeep or change my own oil. Like chillllll its not that a big a deal

2511 2018-09-29 17:39:40 Depending on the match they want you to remember EVERYTHING to build HHH vs Undertaker “for the last time” until HBK & Kane sell out their word for Oil Money.

2512 2018-09-29 17:39:33 Yup. The “ @Greenpeace express” if oil rail cars rolls through the middle of my town of 25,000+ people every day. I lived in QC when lac megantic happened. Now isn’t there funding for a rail bypass? Because energy east isn’t a better idea... #grainonthetrain

2531 2018-09-29 17:36:23 Aye ... with his fucked back ... I will probably have to oil the fucker up to get him in and out of the car 
2532 2018-09-29 17:36:22 The question is, the premium for shipping WCS oil by rail vs by pipeline is generally about $10-15 a barrel, so there has to be a lot more in that differential than transport, like refinery demand for heavy crude.
2533 2018-09-29 17:36:18 I am out getting a oil change- Do not tell me this freshman took a hit? I saw this shit comin... Dabo in trouble.
2534 2018-09-29 17:36:10 They bribe politicians to and push more oil pipelines through the poorest populated areas causing sky-high cancer rates, then bribe to fight Medicare for All. The Koch's are at constant war against the most vulnerable. Such oligarchs are the most evil monsters on the planet.

2539 2018-09-29 17:35:23 All cars have harmful effects on the environment. The removal of batteries and their toxic waste, generation of electricity, the creation of the cars, the oil, etc. It's the cost of fast and accessible transportation.

2552 2018-09-29 17:33:50 My experience with water stains has mostly been with leatherworking...

....and, yeah, most of them don't compare to oil stains or antiquing gels. Not sure with the wood stains, but with leather the water also seem to require a _lot_ more buffing to remove excess

2568 2018-09-29 17:32:11 Hmm but even truffle oil or a shard of two would lift this recipe to another level. In my opinion.
2569 2018-09-29 17:32:07 Hemp in buildings,same as straw,but is a lot more versatile but all take up valuable farm land,solar in fields is stupid,and the cbd oil by Holland and Barret is shite,you should boycott the government to divert royalties from oil from local council and into alternative energy

2598 2018-09-29 17:28:56 People use that term differently. I typically use it to refer to oil based vapes, and I think he was using it in that sense too. But you’re absolutely right - @180Smoke carries a number of cannabis flower vaporization devices legal for use today

2667 2018-09-29 17:22:12 Why does an oil change take 4 hours even with a scheduled appointment? #wastedweekend
2668 2018-09-29 17:22:00 6 Tablespoons locust beans (Iru) {please if I'm going to eat from it, kindly grind the iru as much as possible. I don't want to see them at all

1 1/2 cups palm oil

3 cubes of seasoning cubes ( I prefer knorr)

Salt to taste

2670 2018-09-29 17:21:59 Just the standard 50,000 mile check up. (oil, lube, tire pressure....) I'm a cancer survivor so they call me in to poke and prod every six months or so. (I really don't mind.... it's the most 'action' this old body gets these days.) I'll check out your tweet. Thanks.
2671 2018-09-29 17:21:56 Oil บำรุงผมค่าา
2672 2018-09-29 17:21:53 Try hand sanitizer. Lots of it. It will cool them down and desensitize the "hunan hand" (that's the most common term for it). You might also try soaking them in milk or rubbing them with oil.
2673 2018-09-29 17:21:50 Were happy to send out a free sample if you would like to try the oil.
2674 2018-09-29 17:21:37 I totally agree with you. After the Rohit Vemula & JNU episodes, this Ministry required someone who could pour oil on troubled waters. The mild mannered yet astute Mr. Javdekar has managed to do that. He will also bring in change, gradually, without causing undue controversy.
2675 2018-09-29 17:21:19 Totally. I told you 1-2 months ago that oil prices were going up.
2676 2018-09-29 17:20:59 IDGAF If My Car On Fire  Bihhh I Came For An Oil Change  THATS IT
2677 2018-09-29 17:20:55 The gas tax was a democrat thing. Why would Republicans tax the one thing that drives them? (Oil)

2679 2018-09-29 17:20:46 I know plenty about china and there corruption my friend! I'm not a fool! problem is we in bc have the chance to b on the front lines of change to green energy and economy but our federal and provincial govt r too much in the pocket of oil and gas industry #bcpoli #cdnpoli /1
2680 2018-09-29 17:20:39 I'm too far gone into hazy IPAs and motor oil stouts
2681 2018-09-29 17:20:26 You realize we own the pipeline right? And it’s CDN oil and CDN companies right. You need to do some reading bud!
2682 2018-09-29 17:20:22 I had one goal today.  Clips on my window well.  So far I have purchased the clips, fell down in an oil slick covered in kitty litter, poked myself in eye with  a stick and misplaced the clips.  #itsonlynoon
2683 2018-09-29 17:20:22 Tell me why I go to get a complimentary oil change at my local dealership (because I’m lazy) and the dude gets in my car and starts revving it lmao. Bro if you blow my engine up

2685 2018-09-29 17:19:39 The problem is that global demand rises every year. Then you add 1) depletion 2) Venezuela shrinking production 3) major underinvestment in 14-16 period 4) Iran sanctions 5) Non-Opec growth disappointing. Oil may have to go to a level where demand is rationed by price.
2686 2018-09-29 17:19:28 You are limiting your thinking to cannabis.
I am talking about HEMP. 
It is being made into building blocks (Hempcrete)
CBD oil which is selling out regularly at Holland & Barrett is made by a Dutch company called Jacob Hooy and they have no UK competition (yet).
Hemp fabrics etc
2687 2018-09-29 17:19:26 There are indeed some very very good soaps that are made using oils like coconut oil for example, but they usually up the cleansing agents to make them work as good as the original

2691 2018-09-29 17:19:11 Hydrators add water to the skin. Oils help seal in moisture. It's not uncommon for oily skin to react well to oil! By adding oil in your routine, your face won't feel the need to produce more
2692 2018-09-29 17:18:38 .
2693 2018-09-29 17:18:37 @LeVeonBell  come to Indianapolis. Lucas oil stadium is the best stadium in the NFL!!!
2694 2018-09-29 17:18:33 I wish all miners would cut production and focus on their balance sheets. Kind of like what oil producers did when price collapsed.
2695 2018-09-29 17:18:32 I was just driving to oil change and a homeless lady and man were fighting in the street the lady went to walk away and the guy ran up and knocked her out than grabbed her by the hair and was dragging her away.Everyone grabbed the guy and called police.
2696 2018-09-29 17:18:24 Came to the dealership for an oil change. Left $1000 lighter. What a great day 
2697 2018-09-29 17:18:10 เนี่ยเห็นมั้ยให้เราจะได้จบๆ 555555
2698 2018-09-29 17:18:03 I get the same kind of anxiety when the oil change guys show me the level on the dipstick as I do when a waiter shows me the outside of a bottle of wine.
2699 2018-09-29 17:17:48 Exfoliate with coconut oil and sugar and sleep with blistex or vasaline 
2700 2018-09-29 17:17:42 Your chili oil propaganda prompted this purchase. I like it just dont think to get it often
2701 2018-09-29 17:17:39 But it's different when you or I get groped. Because reasons.
2702 2018-09-29 17:17:37 I'm doing an argan? oil hair mask and I think the package includes a kids shower cap or I have a giant head because it won't fit properly. So I've got oil dripping down my neck. Textures and sensations freak me out. I don't know how long I'm gonna last but I want pretty hair
2703 2018-09-29 17:17:32 Chelsea 1 - Liverpool 0 
2704 2018-09-29 17:17:31 Quite the lovefest between the two, of course the leaders of the other oil producing nations love them too as they are keeping our oil from reaching the world market.
2705 2018-09-29 17:17:29 I can't wait until people start making "when the US finds out you have oil" jokes in Congress and stuff and we can watch on C-SPAN as these top government officials moan and cover their faces and say "It was ONE TIME"
2706 2018-09-29 17:17:06 Yes, let's just go ahead and speed up the destruction of our planet. Stupid argument. He's trying to keep us in the past by protecting oil companies instead of thinking to the future of eco-transportation. He and his cronies would lose profits so opt to keep us in the dark ages.
2707 2018-09-29 17:17:06 First Impression: Road rash, metal fatigue, a little bit of inflammation, lubricate with an oil can, take two aspirin and call me in the morning if your symptoms change, and we'll see what's up the tailpipe.
2708 2018-09-29 17:16:57 rub baby oil on it i imagine 
2709 2018-09-29 17:16:35 @realDonaldTrump has to prove he is a negotiator, but he is not at the table. This is not a card game called ,trump! Canada could shut off the oil heading south.
2710 2018-09-29 17:16:31 I thought they reduced oil prices to tell everyone else in OPEC to stick to their quotas instead of cheating and producing more and selling it on the side. That and to make it uneconomical for the US to Frak and stuff. (The rest of OPEC can't produce as cheap as Saudi).
2711 2018-09-29 17:16:29 The studies we need is how the state mil bus benefits from cutting out women from political and economic participation & the tools they use

2713 2018-09-29 17:16:16 You want the real scary ones, piss off the Essential Oil people. They’re like locusts descending on you. Locusts who are really pissed that you say they shouldn’t drip lavender on their cat’s bad knee.
2714 2018-09-29 17:16:08 There’s forces in this country that prevents economic mobility, don’t listen to those “self help” “get rich” books these snake oil merchants are trying to sell you, basically telling you, “you’re not trying hard enough”
2715 2018-09-29 17:15:57 kalo ga pigmentted aq ada saran coba sebelum dipake dibasahin dulu brush/tangannya. bisa juga pake castor oil
2716 2018-09-29 17:15:54 Oh yeah oil change dumb expensive. Gotta look for them deals. I go to pep boys..spend like 45.  High mileage oil change only tho since my Honda over 110,000

2721 2018-09-29 17:14:36 It’s possible as some French fry oil is made from beef fat, it may have been a very small soap manufacturer.
The company I worked for used about 1000 tons a week
2722 2018-09-29 17:14:31 if you have a headache that won’t go away putting vapor rub or peppermint oil on your temples, nostrils and back of the neck really helps out

2724 2018-09-29 17:14:13 The forest is gone now, but it was never the trees that lost people.

The secret paths through the parking lot. The oil stained refuge of cart pushers and shoplifters, haunted by lost shoppers looking for their cars
2725 2018-09-29 17:14:08 with all this oil theyre giving us, thats nothing unless you used them all on commissions >.>
2726 2018-09-29 17:14:06 Just think … without the Chicxulub asteroid, there would be NO oil :)
2727 2018-09-29 17:14:04 I'm of the belief that they're only after the (yet untapped) billions of barrels of crude oil sitting right under Al Aqsa and Tel Aviv. Once the Palestinians have their own state, they flood the UK with said oil...yeah. That's the ticket!  (sarcastic for those who're not clear)

2735 2018-09-29 17:13:10 Thanks to fracking America is now self sufficient in oil too. Although Greenpeace would rather we didn't frack anywhere, and move the oil around.
2736 2018-09-29 17:13:01 Russia was never invited by Syria. It was a soft invasion agreed upon by Obama and Putin. Americans had taken their share of losses in Iraq. It was Russia to take turn and occupy Syrian natural resources after US occupied oil from Iraq.

2747 2018-09-29 17:11:20 Oil sold in USD = profits for RU. I could have said bananas. The point being, despite their statement that they would stick with 100% compliance, profits are too enticing to stick to that agreement, thus we are seeing surging production.
2748 2018-09-29 17:11:19 Ahhhh if you make Tuna Fantastic (tuna capers cherry tomatoes basil olive oil) the spiral is de rigeur. Given the 50 jars of capers recently unearthed this may be dinner tonight.

2802 2018-09-29 17:04:10 Flour, yeast, a bit of salt and sugar and some warm water. When the dough has risen then we fry it in oil. It's usually eaten with polony and cheese
2803 2018-09-29 17:04:09 Olive oil has a low smoke point however all the antioxidants prevent it from oxidation so it is still fine to cook with.  I never cook anything high heat anyway, everything on low to medium besides grilling.
2804 2018-09-29 17:03:54 I had to explain to various people at my local Chevy dealership how electric cars work and why I don’t have to change oil. Hey @GM need a someone to educate your service technicians on EVs?
2805 2018-09-29 17:03:35 Was thinking about Trump's sudden focus on blaming fossil fuels for the weather. I don't buy it. I think it's possibly a scapegoat for oil trade issues. Possibly to distract from future oil shortages, or oil price hikes.

Otherwise I could send pictures of my truck with a rebuilt engine from you guys that leaks oil & has been in the shop 3 times to fix the leaks & it still leaks.

2937 2018-09-29 16:46:02 UK needs revenues (growth) fast. But where will it come from? They're already pumping more oil/gas.

2940 2018-09-29 16:45:52 Plz check the prices.
Crude oil in international marker 78.6 Dollar 
Electricity 480 billion depict 
Gas 186 billion depict & and the previous government took 1200  billion loan from the state bank.

2942 2018-09-29 16:45:46 Yes they will change things but that will not happen overnight. When did Asad Omar say oil price was high? Compare the intl oil price and dollar rate then and you will have the answer yourself. Oil is $85 a barrel compared to $30 not long ago while usd fell 25% recently.
2943 2018-09-29 16:45:39 I've been following info on this research for a while & I feel the same way...like it's a long way off. 

I hadn't heard abt the research on peanut allergies. That's great! Ik some are so sensative that just dust or oil residue can set of anaphylaxis.
2944 2018-09-29 16:45:38 nope we didn't sadly, just regular old neck oil
2945 2018-09-29 16:45:29 nice, yes coconut oil / ghee or beef dripping/lard are my go-to's too. I once filled up a deep fat fryer with beef dripping. Parsnips and sweet potatoes are incredible done that way 
2946 2018-09-29 16:45:09 i dROPPED MY EFFICASCENT OIL

2950 2018-09-29 16:44:21 OH MY  Sorry Guys, but a friend once "experimented with Oil of Clove" He sang Soprano for nearly a week.  
2951 2018-09-29 16:44:20 my parents are like oil and water still til this day
2952 2018-09-29 16:44:18 I was totally just fucking with Bizi about the volcano stuff. But I'm serious about the oil flowing forever.
2953 2018-09-29 16:44:09 It’s a leafy green vegetable that can be used in salads. It has a lot of iron in it and it’s really good for you. I really like it raw with lemon and olive oil or cooked in kale chips or in a good smoothie
2954 2018-09-29 16:43:38 Get real.  APS will raise rates regardless of how they create it.  With sanctions against Iran, the cost of oil and gas will go up and so will our bills.  Forcing them to go solar will take away the vagaries of the international players and situations.
2955 2018-09-29 16:43:20 Old Hondas don't need oil. Everything I thought I knew is a lie #RoachesToWrenches

2957 2018-09-29 16:43:16 Falwell is no Christian. He’s a charlatan. A snake oil salesman. A political hack.
2958 2018-09-29 16:43:06 It’s going to take a bath in oil until May
2959 2018-09-29 16:43:06 Again AP samjh nai ray point. Election sai pelay factz Bata detay why not do?
Simple, vote nai miltay. This is pure diplomassy. Why saying hum change ker day gay. Should say haqeeqat hum change ker dey gaybut will be take ages. Umar Asad say when in oposition that oil price high
2960 2018-09-29 16:42:53 Honestly, there is no end to the amount of oil. The Earth never stops making it. Not even on Christmas.
2961 2018-09-29 16:42:35 they’re ripping you off wholesale
2962 2018-09-29 16:42:34 Sitting in this waiting room, waiting for my oil to be changed. Walked into said waiting room and all three white people stopped all conversation and stared. But my hair is cute
2963 2018-09-29 16:42:26 Sadly, my lovely Audi died of overwork and was not at all eco-friendly. We use oil and gas products to protest against them. Superb irony.
2964 2018-09-29 16:42:23 Anthony “Tony” Mace, 66, of the United Kingdom, the former CEO of SBM Offshore, N.V.

2966 2018-09-29 16:42:17 ..life that defies humanity.. What does that mean? That Mbonye now pisses refined cooking oil and not urine?
2967 2018-09-29 16:42:10 Dangerous to automatically dismiss studies based on funding. If you do that, then we’ll have to throw out many studies supporting PUFA and low saturated fat that we’re supported by vegetable oil and sugar industry. Mechanisms not persuasive when don’t translate into outcomes.
2968 2018-09-29 16:42:06 Sana oil
2969 2018-09-29 16:41:52 Believe the memes! Jet-fuel can’t melt steel beams! Abraham Lincoln hid a bunch of knives in his hat! ILLUMINATI! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
2970 2018-09-29 16:41:52 My pleasure keep bring the great music
2971 2018-09-29 16:41:46 True. The first thing Venezuela did to start that path was socialize the oil industry which allowed Chavez to take the profit to buy off public support at the expense of future oil revenue. That's what happens when government has too much power, because there is no oversight
2972 2018-09-29 16:41:39 So why isn't the Iranian gov taking this tech further? 

Who's gonna use all the oil up?
2973 2018-09-29 16:41:37 gotdamn, they finished my front brakes already-just need to get to the rear 

I be outta here by 1, omw to the dealership for this oil change by 2
2974 2018-09-29 16:41:37 I’m starting to believe the workers at oil change spots don’t actually yell anything. They just say some gibberish
2975 2018-09-29 16:41:27 I’ve worked with unions where one or two will pull  it off after workshops realising there are multiple ways to think about it.

2978 2018-09-29 16:40:34 I lost my mum to the cold hands  today. She was at FMC Umuahia. Her breathing failed. She was put on Oxygen two days ago. She couldn't make it.  We were told to get crude oil to rub over her body to resuscitate her yesterday. We tried we couldn't get that substance 
2979 2018-09-29 16:40:34 Hi Mr. Lee you should look into buying and taking Blackseed Oil and Wheatgrass everyday it will heal and correct any ailments in the body also Dr. Sebi herbs because we need you to stay around forever..oh and if you are taking blood thinners then no wheatgrass ok. Peace and Love
2980 2018-09-29 16:40:20 I'v seen OIL if you know you know 
2981 2018-09-29 16:40:17 エクストラバージンオイルってなんか卑猥だよね。
2982 2018-09-29 16:40:02 Just a re-cap for ya. You think Buffett’s passing on an oil investment is a sign that he’s getting out of Fossil Fuels.....then BAM,
Invests heavily in Fossil Fuels in 2016....What is your saying again?? CHECKMATE . You’re your own worst enemy.
2983 2018-09-29 16:39:57 Also my demand is not quantifying choice force and all the gray areas. It’s the politics of the office and the military Mullah complex.
2984 2018-09-29 16:39:52 I agree they both need more time before they can say their in love obviously because on the show it’s water and oil
2985 2018-09-29 16:39:37 How many miles she got on her?  I got mine new battery, new tires, wipers, brakes and rotors, oil change etc in the past six weeks. Then made her take all four of us and my scooter, to Philly and back. She’s exhausted

2988 2018-09-29 16:39:06 All these things can be replaced nowadays. There is no excuse for monopolising markets with toxic oil products.
Why don't you invest in hemp for example?
2989 2018-09-29 16:39:03 Tea tree oil fixes everything 
2990 2018-09-29 16:39:02 These niggas doing my oil change fine as fuck
2991 2018-09-29 16:38:55 Try using like coconut oil or some type of oil with a cotton ball, that’s what works for me
2992 2018-09-29 16:38:32 Safi makeup remover tuh isi 200ml sekitar 70rban, yg 100ml di Mutiara 38rban

Kalo Garnier tuh 125ml 40rban deh yg oil jadi.... Bisa aja lebih murah Garnier tp efeknya di muka enakan Safi wkwkwkw
2993 2018-09-29 16:38:22 I’ve also met Hindu women who wore it to defend themselves during gang violence years in Karachi. Zia made it a pint to hand chadors.
2994 2018-09-29 16:38:16 Hopefully you're all having more fun than your lovely admin, who is getting her oil changed on a Saturday.
2995 2018-09-29 16:38:15 Zvaizikanwa kuti oil irimo muzim kare
2996 2018-09-29 16:38:11 I had a guy tell me I have the body of a 25 yr old. 

I'm unsure if it's a compliment or they finally unearthed the oil drums in my backyard.
2997 2018-09-29 16:38:03 boil 3 cups of water with salt and oil
put 2 cups rice in boiling water
bring heat down to the second to lowest temp. don’t touch the pot for 30 mins & then it should be done
if not stir rice & just mix it around & then cook for a little more
if more rice double it
2998 2018-09-29 16:38:01 peppermint oil! works wonders if you rub it on your temples
2999 2018-09-29 16:37:54 Aww poor baby. Peppermint essential oil might help him.
3000 2018-09-29 16:37:25 Pls what’s the name of your oil?
3001 2018-09-29 16:37:22 All these online vendors, who can help me get the Liverpool face cap
3002 2018-09-29 16:37:21 Well I disagree because the Pakistani state has deliberately injected this from high office and I’m schooled in what you’re saying here.
3003 2018-09-29 16:37:17 Lithium is not rare earth. And unlike oil, it stays in the car permanently and can be recycled.
3004 2018-09-29 16:37:09 There is some stuff at Canadian tire made buy Lucus oil that you can put in and try to fix the leak. Ive used it on my ranger before and it seemed to work.
3005 2018-09-29 16:37:08 Well I like nuts, seeds, some coconut and olive oil, tahini, soy, tofu, dark chocolate, edamame, tempeh...
3006 2018-09-29 16:37:04 I live within 1 km of a wind turbine, solar panels, and an oil well. The oil pump is the only one constantly producing/extracting. I would support the royalties from oil going to implement and improve energy storage technologies. I am sure you appreciate 24/7 electricity too
3007 2018-09-29 16:36:44 Everything has some impact on our environment. Wood needs trees to be cut down. Metal needs to be mined. Foam probably uses oil that needs to be extracted from our lands (wells everywhere). Concrete needs sand and other ingredients from the Earth (ie more mining).
3008 2018-09-29 16:36:12 I could wear the veil and do and my position as someone from the global south and brown does not emanate from a aversion to difference
3009 2018-09-29 16:36:06 @CoryBooker I’m sitting here in middle America, watching your speech on CSPAN.  Let me tell you what America’s think of you: You’re a shame, a fake.  You’re a snake oil salesman, nothing more!  Please run for @POTUS in 2020 so we can be expose you for the fraud you are!

3013 2018-09-29 16:35:54 Sounds like you should be in a bed, not getting your oil changed 
3014 2018-09-29 16:35:52 Meditation Day 5-Who did the advertising for the coconut oil? It’s everywhere #globalworld
3015 2018-09-29 16:35:52 When approx. 1% of oil's value is invested moving a car passenger, there might be silver lining rethinking material application in lieu of using steel dampened by tariffs.

3020 2018-09-29 16:35:21 Modi govt wants us to forget DeMo disaster, ignore worst performance by Rupee, forgive higest price of oil, also ignore derth of jobs AND vote it back to power jst because of surgical strikes, (which were done by earlier too, but previous govts were mature enuf to keep it secret)
3021 2018-09-29 16:35:20 Cashews aren’t creamy. In milk form. Add some cashew butter, and maybe some canola oil.
3022 2018-09-29 16:35:18 Hi Lunar! I definitely agree that the sugar content is high. I use this one every few days when they get groomed and clipped as it’s their favourite and contains Taurine. On a day to day basis they get 100% pure Alaskan salmon oil :)
3023 2018-09-29 16:35:01 Yeah you are right am bitter full...I dont have problem of admiting that Merc are better as they are in last 5 years...Ferrari is not Merc that complain to Fia like Merc. Did with battery, drs, oil burn, sidepodes...they use team orders on Bot to help Ham...
3024 2018-09-29 16:35:00 Mani/ pedi brows massage, oil change & car wash, laundry, and media practice today. Pretty productive day ahead 
3025 2018-09-29 16:34:58 Everyone knows that the only reason the entire planet isn't a volcano right now is because of Exxon. Crude oil makes volcanoes if you don't harvest it. It's simple math. #Logic
3026 2018-09-29 16:34:57 That moment when they come back after the mission at the oil rig. They covered their face because they are #Paskal  What a moment 
3027 2018-09-29 16:34:49 Chelsea signing the Gerrard song less than a minute in. Typical of a club whose only history is stock prices for oil.

3038 2018-09-29 16:33:02 not to mention many women who wear the veil operate as human beings + take agency in ways unrelated to their attire. centralizing any discussion of Bushra - or anyone else who veils - just on her attire objectifies her. we r reducing her to her garment of clothing.
3039 2018-09-29 16:33:00 They have coconut oil infused combs now

3043 2018-09-29 16:32:24 Do you consider yourself a scientist? Why would you discard an energy source hundreds of times more materials dense than solar/wind generation, millions of times more fuel dense than oil, and with the lowest carbon and deaths per unit of energy?

3051 2018-09-29 16:31:36 taking stance against veil simply demarcates feminists as opposing ppl who dress like that - aka women who r different from them. both theoretically + strategically, its a disaster

3057 2018-09-29 16:30:39 On this I want to agree with @ProfJNMoyo. This is a scientific matter. I remember watching the late Nathan Shumhuyarira on tv, a long time ago showing areas along the great dyke known to be rich with mineral deposits including oil. No prophecy here.
3058 2018-09-29 16:30:20 Is there anyone on here prepared to tell my why Karl Robinson should keep his job. Told you he was a snake oil salesman, told you he was a gobshite, told you he was confused and lost. FFS get this ludicrous self publicist clown out of my club now #OUFC

3061 2018-09-29 16:29:49 @BBCRadio4 Contrary to what was just stated, the children that I know who have severe peanut allergies had mothers who used breast cream with peanut oil in it so their children were exposed to this from birth. Some feel that this was the problem.
3062 2018-09-29 16:29:44 Personal rights and agency is neoliberal 'empowered' feminism bs however many women in Pakistan dress like that. quantifying whether its by force or choice shouldn't be the central q - rather its a cultural difference, and requires due engagement.
3063 2018-09-29 16:29:35 The regime policies have consistently driven down on social and economic inequality compared to pre revolution despite dependence on oil which is subject to hostile external factors, increasing population & increasing urbanization

3073 2018-09-29 16:27:05 It needs having lots of palm oil "cheese" to get that.
3074 2018-09-29 16:26:40 Unfortunately, synthetic versions of THC/CBD won't have the same result as a whole plant extract, which you can consume without combustion. For example, Rick Simpson oil. You also don't get terpenes like myrcene, which is found in mangos and is anti-inflammatory.

3078 2018-09-29 16:26:15 @CannabizCountry  Tip of the day.
  CBD OIL TOMATO VINAIGRETTE
CBD infused oil is the perfect base for a refreshing tomato vinaigrette.  It can be used on salads, meats, and as a delicious flavouring.

3086 2018-09-29 16:24:45 The Almond one from the Body shop is really good
My hands get so extremly dry that the skin acutally tears open. What really helps too is to lather them in a really thick body butter or oil, put on cotton gloves and let that sink in over night
3087 2018-09-29 16:24:33 I need a oil change and FOUR new tires...that’s crazy dawg. I might as well just trade the whole car in.
3088 2018-09-29 16:24:33 Let's get some pipelines built and direct revenue from them towards transitioning to a post-oil society! It will take long and coat lots so why not use oil to help fund it?
3089 2018-09-29 16:24:31 Yeah, I've had female friends get drunk and flash their chest or privates at me.  They did later thank me for looking away but it was still very uncomfortable.  But sure... it's only men who do bad things.

3113 2018-09-29 16:20:29 Truth be told the number one ingredient you want in any skin care, is green tea.... ive seen it cure so many different types of skin issues... along with vitamin E.  Tea tree oil also.
3114 2018-09-29 16:20:23 And CBD oil. 
3115 2018-09-29 16:20:19 IMO, the best thing for bouchard long term is to send him back to junior, no? But I actually trust that yawney will have good input looking at the progress of Montour and Manson in Anaheim.
3116 2018-09-29 16:20:17 It seems excessive to have two inexperienced players with similar skill sets at such a crucial position. If they roll with it, kudos for being aggressive and risk tolerant considering the consequences for a bad start.

3187 2018-09-29 16:11:20 Actually it helps if your getting consistent scoring from the blue line. Part of last year’s problem was that Edmonton’s PP had one of (if not the lowest) goal totals from blueline. There were a couple issues with the PP, and that was one of them.

3194 2018-09-29 16:10:43 When I saw they changed the parade route I was like nope we ain’t going cause I knew it was gon be some .  Went got an oil change and washed my car.  Might not even go on campus and just chill in my aunt front yard.
3195 2018-09-29 16:10:39 I disagree on the entire premise. Most goals are scored in tight on the PP and not a rocket from the point.
3196 2018-09-29 16:10:37 I think if Peter adds a player it is far more likely to be a more substantial piece, in a trade. PTO’s are already for the most part waiver-quality players. No disrespect meant.

3204 2018-09-29 16:09:08 Ya agree w Rob here. Anyone on waivers that’ll go through in the next week or so likely isn’t going to be able to run a PP. Chiarelli would have to look via trade, even then he’s gotta exhaust his in-house options before going that route; Bear, Benning, Bouchard, Klefbom, Nurse..

3221 2018-09-29 16:06:53 It just seems to me it's all perception of less oil usage,which employs thousands agree, but we also do other industries as well.This shows to me how less than 1% of the population can control economies around the world for personal gain. It appears to me,  2/3
3222 2018-09-29 16:06:50 Based on play 6-7 should be Bouchard and Bear. They can rotate if need be, but ideally want both those assets playing, so that 6-7 is very much open. Garrison looks better than Jerabek right now. It’ll be interesting which way they go, but get the feeling they’ll sign Garrison
3223 2018-09-29 16:06:48 Personne ne parle jamais de l'effet rebond avec l'isolation des logements. Hors remboursement de la dette pour le cout de travaux, l'isolation fait baisser mes frais de fonctionnement. Je récupère du budget dc je le dépense en achetant des babioles chinoises ou en prenant l'avion
3224 2018-09-29 16:06:41 Except when the oil filter doesn’t wanna come off
3225 2018-09-29 16:06:32 Seriously? @RandPaul wants to lift Russian sanctions, visits Moscow? What do they have on this traitor? Trump doing enough by cancelling Iran nuclear deal & reimposing sanctions, causing oil price to go to $100 a barrel soon, pouring money into Russia. GOP= Government of Putin

3227 2018-09-29 16:06:24 This deluxe spa pedicure is everything I needed. Iont even know what she doing but this oil smells divine and this mask thing smells minty fresh too. Much excite and relaxation. Cast off needed this lol

3229 2018-09-29 16:06:14 Can’t be proud of a president who gets rid of habeas corpus... expands oil drilling... adds 4 more wars were engaged in.... seriously @kathygriffin learn to think for yourself
3230 2018-09-29 16:06:12 Changing my car oil is therapeutic lol
3231 2018-09-29 16:06:04 そういや明智の子ども時代？は…年末までの楽しみなんですかね…
3232 2018-09-29 16:05:46 Maybe you need to add too picture of one liter Oil  .
3233 2018-09-29 16:05:38 Olive oil is a 1 fruit juice
3234 2018-09-29 16:05:37 In April 2016 I said $TNX 4% by 2019. I think I’m a year early. So I don’t see 6% by 2020. Oil heading from $70 to $90 by next year, however will put me back on track for 4%. Trade  Wars are the inflationary fuel to bid rates higher no doubt but $TNX moves at snails pace usually!
3235 2018-09-29 16:05:36 Sitting up here at Jiffy Lube trying to get much needed oil change done. #SaturdayMorning

3242 2018-09-29 16:04:04 Shaanti gai oil lainay 
3243 2018-09-29 16:04:03 Why not? Are personal rights and agency the only way to think about the veil? Is there a diff when we discuss those who represent the state?
3244 2018-09-29 16:03:57 Does anyone know of a vegan/cf version of carmex? My lips are so chapped and I’m in need of something intense (coconut oil doesn’t work)
3245 2018-09-29 16:03:56 oil money talks
3246 2018-09-29 16:03:55 :) it's about 500 yds from my mum's. I don't think they've changed the oil since the first ever batch.
3247 2018-09-29 16:03:52 Don’t tell me shit else wrong with my car, I don’t wanna get charged 70 for an oil change fuckkkkkk
3248 2018-09-29 16:03:41 Finally getting my baby a oil change 
3249 2018-09-29 16:03:17 Brunswick friends:  is there like a quick lube oil change place there off one of the 95 exits?
3250 2018-09-29 16:03:14 Somehow manage to get used motor oil in my Red Bull and boy was that an unwelcome surprise
3251 2018-09-29 16:02:54 High oil prices do not cause recessions, but rather reveal the fragilities of a failing Keynesian system. Same goes for normalizing interest rates, a 4.5% mortgage should not derail a real recovery. Fed may have to choose between high oil, or rate hikes. @nfergus @LukeGromen
3252 2018-09-29 16:02:50 Made an appointment at the dealership to get my oil changed... why is the wait still 3 hours?

3255 2018-09-29 16:02:21 Okay but listen if @Target had an auto care center that I could get an oil change at I WOULD NEVER FORGET TO CHANGE MY OIL
3256 2018-09-29 16:02:14 US President Mr.Trump is dictating terms over Iran final sanction and Indian PM is silent on the oil imported from Iran which is so vital & cheap as also the fate of Chabahar Project.
3257 2018-09-29 16:02:06 surely a complete halt on oil sands expansion would face even steeper political opposition than a carbon tax?
3258 2018-09-29 16:02:06 Good for you. Wood is my primary medium but I’ve been cutting, forming and fusing metal since I was eight. Grandpa used to oil as I cut 1/4” plate for wood stoves with a cheap jigsaw. Manipulating materials is pretty close to communion with God for me.
3259 2018-09-29 16:02:05 Bout to cop CBD oil from one of these booths.
3260 2018-09-29 16:02:03 After a new alternator, new tires, breaking down in terrahaute, breaking down on the way to my dads, a $200 engine coil replacement, breaking down on the way to Detroit, an oil change, and a full inspection later my car is still bogging down and stopping :,) time to die :)
3261 2018-09-29 16:02:01 After I got out the shower I just put tree mint oil all over my body... this shit got my dick tingling icy rn

3268 2018-09-29 16:01:20 They are against oil. 
This is lib playbook 101.

They did same with nuclear energy.
Claimed that an accident would make areas unlivable for 100 years.

Japan had accidents and 2 nuclear bombs droped on it.
Areas are flourishing plus longest avg life span in world. 
3269 2018-09-29 16:01:07 21 under 14 working upside-down without Oil & Energy.
3270 2018-09-29 16:01:03 Let me be the ignorant one here Neil, if we're not using oil because of recession,to keep prices up, cut production, except the Saudi's didn't.Flooded market with oil, Iran also was able to sell oil. Why are we so tied to oil futures, moving towards solar, wind, energy economy?

3274 2018-09-29 16:00:32 Cars nowadays run between 3-6 GUARTS of oil but nah semis use 10-15 GALLONS ....for some reason that blows me 
3275 2018-09-29 16:00:29 Just had someone ask me “so if I put windshield wiper fluid in where my oil goes do you think that’s bad?” Uh yeah probably not the best sir.
3276 2018-09-29 16:00:19 You do know Libya is technically in a civil war but it's currency is strong compared to Nigeria .... The reason why naira is weak is bcos we import more than we export ..the dollar that is gotten from the export of crude oil is used to sort payment for imported goods

3282 2018-09-29 15:59:53 Epic fail: got more oil burns at work

You have incorectlly information...
3285 2018-09-29 15:59:45 Yeah, this is the causal relationship between adopting a Contributer Covenant or Geek Feminism Wiki-based Code of Kafka.

You adopt it, your project devolves into petty mean-girls cliques and infighting.

Every. Single. Time.

It's what Codes of Kafka cause. They're snake oil.
3286 2018-09-29 15:59:41 Sir will avoiding Pakistan lead to increased straining in the relationship between India and Saudi, a known deobandi supporter leading to further increase in oil prices?

3293 2018-09-29 15:59:04 Well, US added 1 rig & a crude buildup on Wednesday, I can´t see the bullish case. With this irrational exuberant buying in #oil, $wti might hit around $78 & $brent around $88 but after that it will fall down HARD. #OOTT #Commodities #crudeoil #fintwit #CL_F
3294 2018-09-29 15:59:01 Y’all my gas light is on, my tire lights are on, and I need a oil change.. ya girl struggling

3296 2018-09-29 15:58:42 I am flexible. I was fully prepared to short oil at $70 - then turned fully around 9/19 + called for an #OilSpike. I was fully prepared to buy Gold into FOMC - then turned cautious, even bearish big picture. Chop next few months until currencies are ‘safe’ bets + then Gold isn’t.

3300 2018-09-29 15:58:14 UK Head of State Alexander - “My predecessor believed in Brexit, and we are looking to mend fences and oil the globe for progress.

3308 2018-09-29 15:57:24 Meanwhile he told the oil & gas industry the government should work for them, he said reducing Bears Ears & Grand Staircase Escalante wasn't for oil & gas but then sold leases for oil, gas, & mining,... Can't trust what he says!
3309 2018-09-29 15:57:17 You’re right. I was talking more about how some farmers don’t even get the basics right and then look for oil to fix problems that shouldn’t have been a problem
3310 2018-09-29 15:57:11 It all comes down to rattie being consistent,  the pp being successful, and player health. I see oil as wildcard spot if healthy.

3313 2018-09-29 15:56:52 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.

3365 2018-09-30 23:59:14 And then you are watching a documentary and you find out that there are people paid to spread oil all over AJ for a photo-shooting and you realise that you’ve made a lot of wrong choices in your life! I’m in the wrong job @anthonyfjoshua
3366 2018-09-30 23:58:58 I had to put my hair in these ugly ass twists bc that's apparently a "protective style" it took me fucking hours. I had so much breakage. I did a dumbass hot oil treatment before. That also took me fucking hours bc oil is stupid and so is 4c hair.
3367 2018-09-30 23:58:57 จะอะไรก็แล้วแต่อ่ะ อย่าเอาพี่กูไปเกี่ยวได้ป่ะ คืองงมาก อิหยังวะ5555555555555554
3368 2018-09-30 23:58:54 I cant believe oil is finite
3369 2018-09-30 23:58:42 Only if it's like some thc oil or an edible maybe? because just straight weed wouldn't do anything just like eating it without cooking it wouldn't. Its gotta be heated up to a certain temperature to have those canibinoids all activated and whatnot lol
3370 2018-09-30 23:58:33 I think so Stacey.
3371 2018-09-30 23:58:30 And, as I said, show me a quote where a white supremacist has mentioned Olive ... Other than Olive Oil, naturally, 
3372 2018-09-30 23:58:15 I was refilling my olive oil dispenser, I forced the spout down and a load of olive oil squirted up and hit me in the eye. So now I know what a girl who's dating an Italian guy feels like #MoneyShot
3373 2018-09-30 23:58:15 こっちは大丈夫でした
3374 2018-09-30 23:58:10 Oil as a moisturizer?
3375 2018-09-30 23:58:09 Oh yeah. I'm estimating 1/4 of fuel costs (at least) plus no oil changes or other fluids. Brakes last 4-5x as long (engine does most of the braking).

3379 2018-09-30 23:57:38 一日ぐらい仕事しなくてもなんとかなるやろ。
3380 2018-09-30 23:57:34 i'll probably try that when i want to farm a certain map, but for the time being my oil is screaming for help in hard mode
3381 2018-09-30 23:57:29 Try spraying a peppermint oil and water mixture around the edges of the room it might deter them also keep corners and ceiling corners clean.
3382 2018-09-30 23:57:27 Your new found love of the oil industry and pipelines is too little too late. See you at the polls in May

3387 2018-09-30 23:56:03 I’d recommend the Pixi Glow mist, it’s got Argan Oil in it, so use it like a setting spray at the end, super nice dewy look & little goes a long way
3388 2018-09-30 23:55:58 Uh they still need oil. If you can’t meet 100% of your demand without it they still have you by the short hairs. Maybe relax and enjoy life instead of being a miserable partisan.
3389 2018-09-30 23:55:56 Liberals want it because they haven’t gotten what they wanted in at least two years.

3397 2018-09-30 23:55:04 I really like lavender too, and that usually comes in the starter pack. There should be a cup or container within that you add the water and oil too, and then plug it in
3398 2018-09-30 23:54:52 ALSO APPLY OIL AT KEAST ONCE A MONTH BEFORE U SHOWER
3399 2018-09-30 23:54:48 You forget who you were before Parnassus. You are what he has made you and you’re glad.

Legend has it he fucked an oil well once.
3400 2018-09-30 23:54:47 FAITH WORKS. It stirs boldness, confidence, to dare the seemingly impossible. Notice Elisha’s bold faith when he ordered the widow to borrow vessels and pour oil. (2. Kings 4). Boldness and Leadership before us #Commanding! BE BOLD!
3401 2018-09-30 23:54:46 Yiff boi can fit a lot more than oil I’m sure, bet he’s got a lot of trunk space ;3

3403 2018-09-30 23:54:36 No more expensive oil bills with the geothermal heating.  Expensive to install but pay back is fairly quick. Hate paying those rich oil companies. Can't beat wood heat if you don't mind a little work in the bush cutting wood.

In his own list and in the original list, oil money is still down the list.

3429 2018-09-30 23:50:50 @Ritzcrackers are you using palm oil from sustainable sources?  I've stopped buying items listing palm oil...and when you start looking it's in so many things!  poor tribes and creatures living in rainforests, it's heartbreaking and just so wrong how habitat has been wiped out

3435 2018-09-30 23:50:08 Price of oil was higher?
3436 2018-09-30 23:49:59 im running ~50 oil per battle :') cause fletcher fleet can't clear the map

3438 2018-09-30 23:49:49 Like oil & water my bad attitude & short temper don’t mix
3439 2018-09-30 23:49:44 Gl, oil pumps aren’t too terrible of a fix
3440 2018-09-30 23:49:37 Well thank Brian Malroney for that one. It's part of NAFTA. We have to send 75% of our oil and 50% of our refined gas to the USA. Regardless of the needs of Canada.
3441 2018-09-30 23:49:36 Toasted bread, olive oil and rubbed tomato, Salt and pepper. Yum! (Any bread )

3450 2018-09-30 23:48:32 Baby Oil Sex Is So Different OMFG ya too young to understand
3451 2018-09-30 23:48:23 Yes very true. That’s why with olive oil you need to be careful

3458 2018-09-30 23:47:03 I am just learning about the oil/UK/Nigeria dynamic. Can u recommend any links?
Your last sentence does not make sense. Catholics are Christians, as much as Lutherans and Baptists are. I was raised RCC.
3459 2018-09-30 23:46:49 If you mix beer, wine, and peanut oil, you can make a drinkable pb&j
3460 2018-09-30 23:46:12 Oh, that is exactly how it works, I just don't think that is necessarily reflected in the graph.
Same with NGOs protesting Canadian pipelines, so some other supply can dominate the market while maintaining higher oil prices.
3461 2018-09-30 23:45:56 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
3462 2018-09-30 23:45:47 The pipelines are going to happen one way or the other. We are so dependent on oil most people don't even realize it. Look around. See all the plastic? How's that made? Your phone, PC, car. The pipelines will happen. We just need to make sure they are safe
3463 2018-09-30 23:45:14 Castor oil helps a lot!! Mix it with coconut or olive oil because it’s very thick

3469 2018-09-30 23:44:04 visitors dyed in red is destroying my oil supply
3470 2018-09-30 23:43:47 That is the dumbest logic I have heard in a while. So the oil drafted Yakapov because he was ranked number one but he turned out to be a bust and is in the KHL. With your logic, that wasn't a mistake.
3471 2018-09-30 23:43:33 $70 for the oil. $20 for the Oil filter. $18 for just checking fluids which he didn’t do. And, now I have 0 oil in my car and have to have it towed to the VW dealer tomorrow. We tracked down the oil in Target... big ol’ puddle in my parking place as well.
3472 2018-09-30 23:43:33 Might as well have dinner First.... Mark just found the coconut oil soooo about to be busy for a while

3477 2018-09-30 23:42:40 I peel if I'm noshing on them. Scrub if they're being cooked. Peeled carrots plus olive oil, salt, and pepper is awesome and they season better without peel.

3483 2018-09-30 23:41:59 There is hope... my 90 year old sweet Grandma learned about something called "CDB" oil on one of the religious channels she watches. I said "Grandma! Let's get you some CBD oil!" And we did. She is seeing improvement in her osteoarthritis. This is rural GA, the word is spreading.

3520 2018-09-30 23:37:43 I'm pumping the air full of peppermint oil. I'm fine with spiders that are smaller than the palm of my hand. Any bigger and I assume they want to eat me from the feet up.

3523 2018-09-30 23:37:11 What?  Big Oil doing what's right without the heavy hand of government?  Apparently the invisible hand of markets still gets things done.
3524 2018-09-30 23:37:08 @realDonaldTrump so after sucking up to OPEC, if oil prices drop in the U.S. will you writing a “bail out” check for those of us who depend on our small royalty checks??
3525 2018-09-30 23:36:56 I know, I was making fun of it.

3537 2018-09-30 23:35:17 Y'all have bastardized the sugar industry after the country became independent from the British. So much for the white man rule eh. Now the sugar industry is practically in receivership. Shame on you all. Hope you don't do the same to your oil and gas industry.
3538 2018-09-30 23:34:49 @DineshDSouza what do you think about this!?? I think this a load ofThe Bush family was deep pockets full of oil when sitting POTUS along with others that had “businesses” before becoming POTUS. Look into who this judge is. “Democrat” divisive I’m assuming!?
3539 2018-09-30 23:34:41 Fuck, the oil pen just hit
3540 2018-09-30 23:34:39 maybe you could be less biased against an electric car company to make it less obvious you have oil money pushing your agenda...

3541 2018-09-30 23:34:01 I think they do a better job of this when they take an oblique approach, like "Through Donald's Eyes," or, last night, Adam Driver's oil baron; half the jokes in the cold opens are just "I recognize this thing! This is the thing that we all watched happen earlier in the week!"
3542 2018-09-30 23:33:56 They were successful. Canada is not competing with Middle East oil anymore. Do You get it?
3543 2018-09-30 23:33:46 Yeah I am desperately trying to avoid surgery on my back at any cost, so I totally get it! I will look into this oil as well as the acupuncture. Thank you again for your help!

3552 2018-09-30 23:32:37 I need alternatives bc I can’t cook it in olive oil and I hate vegetable oil so h
3553 2018-09-30 23:32:27 Because they are here. What do you want, haven't you stolen enough oil already?
3554 2018-09-30 23:32:26 Actually, just the Oil sands to be precise. There are actually quite a few other areas in Alberta that will benefit from this LNG project #duvernayplay, but the protestors seem to focus only on the Oil sands.
3555 2018-09-30 23:32:22 Maybe I'm not wording this properly. This has less to do with oil, more to do with Alberta getting products to foreign markets. The KM pipeline was like a big we're open for business sign. The way it was halted turned that into a this is what could happen to you.
3556 2018-09-30 23:32:07 Just been out for a curry in Newport Maine on our holidays to be told by the Indian chef that they use vegetable oil to cook curry rather than the traditional ghee.
We had the grilled lamb instead US food needs close scrutiny.

3571 2018-09-30 23:30:22 Two other observations:

lower oil generally means lower BEI so this helps offset things a bit. 

Role of low rates (via shale HY market) is also overlooked in the cycle. Classic Austrian malinvestment which Hayek & others warned about.

3572 2018-09-30 23:30:18 Many good things to do with those old leaves: 1) Pickles, 2) Any oily sauce, 3) soak in olive oil, which then becomes basis for a good vinegar-and-oil salad dressing, 4) potpourri,5) marinades,6) curries.But the plant can be managed for more yield than Xopher seems to be getting
3573 2018-09-30 23:30:14 There’s a massage oil that I love by Young Living called Ortho Sport. It has a lot of great oils in it for soothing and relaxing muscles and can help with nerve pain.

3577 2018-09-30 23:29:32 They don’t have oil filled transformers, but the capacitor is. Running a microwave empty causes the magnetron to hyper heat, since there is nothing to absorb the energy, and it just reflects back as standing waves. Magnetron over heats, and burns up the transformer feeding it
3578 2018-09-30 23:29:22 Yea, I honestly never thought to do it myself despite burning myself several times with hot oil (Nothing with scars that are still there) I just saw them all do it and was like wait what

3594 2018-09-30 23:26:19 We print as much money as we can and put it in the rest of the world's hands. They in turn use it for trade and to buy oil. For us, exporting all that money keeps inflation low.
3595 2018-09-30 23:26:16 Probably not. I got distracted and the oil started smoking a bit much. Really I'd rather be doing it over a charcoal chimney, but one makes do...

3603 2018-09-30 23:24:06 You are given valid information on why Nigeria should move away from oil, citing wonderful examples and Nigerians are nitpicking whether Amazon or Apple is up to $1T. Is it okay for me to give up now? 
3604 2018-09-30 23:24:05 Weigh out eight pinches of olive oil and take off heat.
3605 2018-09-30 23:23:57 also rosehip oil is a miracle
3606 2018-09-30 23:23:46 All tied to OPEC. Production increase in Q4 2014 marks the end of $200B in US shale capex and global oil boom. Lower oil means less recycled revenue from petro states (selling financial assets, fewer treasury flows [KSA became a net borrower], and fewer dollars for RoW).

3620 2018-09-30 23:21:40 I think that gets back to your caterpillar point. Eurozone and Japan are still hubs for capex exports (correct me if I’m off, not near Haver atm) and were the ones to really take the China slowdown on the chin. US takes it on chin b/c of oil primarily
3621 2018-09-30 23:21:39 Update: it's back with a vengeance. I don't have clove oil or garlic. Painkillers aren't doing anything anymore. Tried swirling warm water and salt and currently have a bag of frozen veg wrapped in a towel on my face. This is AGONY

3655 2018-09-30 23:17:42 I would caution against using olive oil for any cooking. It oxidizes at very low temps. Much better off using ghee, lard, or tallow. It’s fine for a dressing.

This activity must cease, given the recorded spills are far greater than that of tankers!

3679 2018-09-30 23:14:46 I don’t why this girl trying to joke on this man. She looks like she uses canola oil as hairspray.
3680 2018-09-30 23:14:20 Petrol and Diesel is another thing. I have a feeling that you're just throwing out all arguments about Palm oil without a proper topic. Let me remind you, your topic was about biodiesel and diabetes/health. Stick to it. I don't have time to explain A-Z to you.
3681 2018-09-30 23:14:12 A2. A competition is always good -- they're running against each other for office, they're trying to win something, etc. If they're in diametrically opposed fields (he's an oil lobbyist, she works for Greenpeace), that's good, too.
3682 2018-09-30 23:13:55 oil is absolutely central to the global economy in 15 -- $50 a barrel move is a huge shock.  

relevant now too, given oil's recent rise.
3683 2018-09-30 23:13:39 In fairness it's also world mud pack day, international translators day, world pony express day (whatever the hell that means!) Extra virgin olive oil day! Presumably virgin olive oil gets another day and last but not least it's world mulled cider day! I'll drink to that!
3684 2018-09-30 23:13:36 Um...apply olive oil and wrestle? Your reading comprehension is pretty basic.

3689 2018-09-30 23:12:49 The olive oil wrestling sounds interesting.  Tell me more.
3690 2018-09-30 23:12:35 Yea he did. I just meant that I do think oil is pretty central to the story, even beyond USD, Fed, EM. EM/China demand definitely softened up oil prices but debt driven shale production and OPEC reaction f’n focusing on mkt share were critical forces.

3697 2018-09-30 23:11:35 Are there any seismic tests being done in the area? With all the fracking it maybe related. If the government of B.C. is going to finance this oil/gas industry we should be monitoring any affects on the area and this unstable dam foundation!

3703 2018-09-30 23:10:42 Well, you drop clear statements to pretend they are vague. You’re a lying asshat who thinks inviting people to kill someone is “freee speech,” and you refuse to explain how to “man up” on a social media platform. Do we fight? Whip it out? Press some benches? Olive oil wrestling?

3764 2018-09-30 23:01:42 @mercola has been full of crap for years. I first encountered his website as a young mother around 2002. He was telling me what I wanted to hear. However I quickly realized he was just pedaling his snake oil and moved on. Never trust a doctor trying to sell you products.

3811 2018-09-30 22:56:34 I say sustainable because Palm oil is abundant in SEA. It is suitable with our land and resources. It has given us something to work on and feed our families.
3812 2018-09-30 22:56:29 Have you heard of the concept "multiplier effect"? Since oil is our mainstay in the country, so many multinational companies are tied to that sector. The foregoing, is the major reason why all  commercial banks have their headquarters located in Lagos state. #think
3813 2018-09-30 22:56:22 Seriously? Glenn Beck wrote a book on an addiction to outrage? Oh the irony! He thrives on outrage! Epitome of conspiracy theorist, shit stirrer, snake oil salesmen & all around partisan asshole. No thanks.
3814 2018-09-30 22:56:18 Not really. I was curious if he had any studies showing saturated fats lower LDL, like they claimed. I'm not personally aware of any, unless you look at coconut oil, which seems to have somewhat neutral effects (typically).

3818 2018-09-30 22:55:56 Just as someone made a better example with Libya case, there's no state in Nigeria today as developed as Lagos with the minimum poverty rate even the oil producing states can't compete, all this bcoz of Tinubu effect so if U don't like him pls stay away 4rm our Lagos.

3819 2018-09-30 22:55:43 after the price of oil collapsed majority of the S&P was in correction. we had the August "15 minute crash".  First quarter of 2016 extreme volatility in the market. so not it wasn't "invisible".
3820 2018-09-30 22:55:43 Made a grocery list and still managed to forget something. Thank God my best friend is my neighbor lol. She’s about to hook me up with olive oil lol

3832 2018-09-30 22:53:41 The thing that the 2015-16 experience with oil and the dollar reminds us is that not every headwind is recessionary. In fact, overall employment growth peaked in the middle of this period.

3840 2018-09-30 22:52:48 "invisible" was the New York Time's framing I think ... 

the deterioration in the real trade balance was really invisible in a deep sense, as it wasn't reflected in the headline nominal trade balance. Oil going from $100 to under $50 has an impact, as US still imports oil on net

Unfortunately it has been gutted and needs to be fixed. Oil has to be subsidized because of point of use taxation.

3864 2018-09-30 22:50:02 2. Diabetes or other disease. Palm oil does not contribute to diabetes directly. I say directly because it's how you cook the food. If instead reusing the oil at a recommended repeatition of 1-3 times, you use it till the 10th time or so ...
3865 2018-09-30 22:50:00 @realDonaldTrump Saudi Arabia and Russia take off Iranian oil on November 4 and oil prices will fall, just a little patience is needed. The US government must be firm and never allow a country to be exempted from sanctions

3927 2018-09-30 22:41:07 I was referring to your retweet. Pumping more oil doesn't make him smart and doesn't necessarily generate additional cash because prices will drop. The economic policies of the gulf countries are highly debatable. I am personally pessimistic.

3958 2018-09-30 22:37:08 I LOVE garlic-inflused olive oil.  And diners, disproportionately run by Greeks, are among my fav go to places when I'm outnabout.  Oh wait, did I just identify a gap? The Diner Gap!  We need to equalize the % of Tibetans/Botswanans/Uzbeks who run diners w/Greeks!
3959 2018-09-30 22:36:56 @zara915 The “Queen Bee” phenomena is real. In groups women do turn on one another. That’s a good start. See, women are humans and humans can be bad. Sexism won’t fix that, sexist.
3960 2018-09-30 22:36:53 Klentak built a team that cannot hit or field. Aside from Nola, pitching is suspect or inconsistent. He hired Captain Coconut Oil to make baffling moves down the stretch. What do they see in Klentak?
3961 2018-09-30 22:36:44 I got the vanilla reed diffuser that primark sells and I’m OBSESSED. Probably the best one I’ve ever bought smell & quality wise! I also use an essential oil diffuser with lavender, frankincense and rose (which are super calming oils!) x

3965 2018-09-30 22:36:12 Mine is stealing new oil filters from a 3-foot shelf upstairs in the shop and chewing them up on the lawn. Vengeance is nigh.

3967 2018-09-30 22:35:48 That's an illusion bro. The IGR you're talking about are brought about by these oil companies and its associated firms located in Lagos. Let them relocate to their areas of operations and see Lagos state crumble financially.

3972 2018-09-30 22:34:42 commodities nice!!! how about some oil next!
3973 2018-09-30 22:34:38 It does! But I'd recommend CBD oil for anxiety 
3974 2018-09-30 22:34:37 Matt Damon is not fit to change the oil in BK’s car, but he can mock a good man on TV. I haven’t watched that show in years, I guess I am not missing anything.

3978 2018-09-30 22:33:56 @Direwolf20 I was wondering if you knew which mod was doing the oil pool worldgen in your modpack.  So far haven't located the settings in the config (if there is any).  Thx for reading.

3982 2018-09-30 22:33:46 Just heard independent Alan Caron interviewed on the MAINE Event on MAINE Public.  I agreed with nearly ALL his positions, and was very supportive of his ambitious plan to replace oil imports with solar and offshore wind in a 30 year strategy.  Strongest candidate now.
3983 2018-09-30 22:33:43 Of course I know that. Do you know WHY we import oil?

There’s no AC/DC, Cold Chisel, Midnight Oil equivalent other than bringing the old boys out themselves.

That said, Black Eyed Peas weren’t a great choice either. Not a great live act.

4003 2018-09-30 22:31:00 True story. When I was a teenager my dad hired this guy to do electrical work or something at our restaurant, I worked there alone with him.

4005 2018-09-30 22:30:54 In clinical practice it is not. In the workplace someone is making a living selling snake oil.  Should be able to opt out. Should not be sold as magic bullet. Bad managers use these techniques. IMHO.

4014 2018-09-30 22:29:42 it looks very healthy. When the stems get that big I use them to skewer chicken. Glaze with oil & spices then grill. Smother with peanut sauce .. delicious :)

4021 2018-09-30 22:28:14 What "subsidies"? You mean like Big Oil and the taxpayer bailout of GM, Chrysler, and Ford? Those "subsidies"?
4022 2018-09-30 22:28:04 The oil must flow!
4023 2018-09-30 22:27:55 True.  That's why corn syrup, corn sugar (dextrose), and soybean oil are in everything and why a hamburger doesn't cost $15.
4024 2018-09-30 22:27:54 “For this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: ‘The jar of flour will not be used up and the jug of oil will not run dry until the day the Lord sends rain on the land.’ ”
1 Kings 17:14 NIV
4025 2018-09-30 22:27:47 I'm on your side here. Just noting the fact that Canadian ban on tankers in the seas of northern BC apply to oil tankers, not LNG ones. FYI, if you really want to know stupid, oil tankers transit those same waters, just outside the exclusion zone, on their way from AK to WA.
4026 2018-09-30 22:27:45 I think it’s that lavender oil I bought
4027 2018-09-30 22:27:41 I used a lot of hot peppers in the chili and the oil from the seeds & ribs must have gotten under my nails when I was scraping it out of the bowl into the compost bucket. Now my fingertips are on fire & I can't wash it off.  #dangerouscooking

4054 2018-09-30 22:25:26 They were never going to war with NK and he knows it. China nor Russia would allow it otherwise it would have happens years ago. NK doesn't have gold or oil after all.

4056 2018-09-30 22:25:20 boscia makeup-breakup (or any) cleansing oil is usually really good for removing makeup, and after I use that I usually wash with a different cleanser too to make sure everything’s off
4057 2018-09-30 22:25:18 Gee. Then let’s build an oil pipeline up north too. At the same time as when we build the LNG pipeline. Side by side. Probably more efficient, easier approvals & save money that way. Jobs. Prosperity. Win-Win for all of Canada.

4067 2018-09-30 22:23:10 Americans have filled our streets with gas guzzling SUVs and Big Trucks. Today's market doesn't seem cognizant that there isn't an endless amount of oil in the ground.
Wonder how deliberate was this manipulation?  Wonder? Not so much. Think Zionist Israel +everything makes sense
4068 2018-09-30 22:22:57 It would be really cool to see you duct taped to a chair with a funnel shoved down your throat watching you guzzle motor oil
4069 2018-09-30 22:22:53 So the logical thing to do is to strenghthen the naira when the oil price is high and with that you wont need to be paying subsisdy. Salaries will also have more value. We have fools running the economy.
4070 2018-09-30 22:22:49 Political inclination is the mother of intellectual inclination,e.g northerners owns more oil well in south south than any region in Nigeria,they are more in d arm forces than other region,into politics more than other region,etc when politics is speaking intellectuality bows.

4073 2018-09-30 22:22:17 I don't like Harper, and I don't care about him. The current pipeline halt threw a wrench into our economy. That is the point. I'm not pro oil. I'm pro Alberta not being expected to depend on it.

4082 2018-09-30 22:20:06 4/ The global oil industry is subsidized to the tune of $5 trillion per year. Musk started Tesla with the goal to get us off fossil fuels, oil being the main one. If it takes a religion based on sustainability to help us get there, I don't get why you see it as such a bad thing?

4103 2018-09-30 22:16:35 Call me for your Cash crop farming,  lets start the plan now. 
Cocoa,  Cashew,  Oil palm,  Coffee and Plantain farming.
4104 2018-09-30 22:16:14 The Horgan & Weaver Government are nothing but a bunch of hypocrites. They just have a real hate on for Western Canadian Oil & Gas. Sickening
4105 2018-09-30 22:16:06 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
4106 2018-09-30 22:15:48 Try adding honey to the yeast mixture and when you prep the pizza for the oven brush olive oil around the perimeter for a golden crust.
4107 2018-09-30 22:15:39 Check the oil and give the tires on the Buick a kick @Fantone
4108 2018-09-30 22:15:38 Honestly a 9 year old Camry that you don’t give a shit about other than that it runs it pretty low maintenance... I fill up the gas tank every 2-3 months, get it inspected and oil change every 12...
4109 2018-09-30 22:15:18 ~ use coconut oil as a hair mask 
~ use light lipstick as a cream blush when you run out 
~ when you apply lipstick put a tissue over it then pat on setting powder over it to make it last longer 
~ use teabags/bath bombs in your bath
4110 2018-09-30 22:15:16 Lmao reminds me of the days when dad made us drink castor oil for a stomach ache.. no medicine allowed  @ala_inW0nderlnd
4111 2018-09-30 22:15:10 You’re right but oil prices was not as high to rake in that much revenues... plus dumsor it was tough. There were other discoveries thereby increasing the volumes plus higher prices we’re getting far more in revenues
4112 2018-09-30 22:15:02 i love aveda and moroccan oil products
4113 2018-09-30 22:14:51 Look maybe we just can't agree, you clearly have no reasonable perspective in which to find it acceptable for Canada to make money on oil. So please stop driving around in your car and don't complain when we get less transfer payments here in NB for healthcare and education.
4114 2018-09-30 22:14:48 The oil companies and therefore carbon lobby are taking responsibility... that means the Blogistanies are just stirring and making $$ from #clickbait
4115 2018-09-30 22:14:33 Really they suppose to be rotated with every oil changed but they don't do that  ima just go buy 4 new ones once my refund drop. 
4116 2018-09-30 22:14:31 The lure of electric is low maintenance- hate filling gas and oil changes etc - but still holding off a bit
4117 2018-09-30 22:14:30 See get out of here , you're sympathizing with evil. Say it with your chest.
4118 2018-09-30 22:14:19 Witch hazel, lemon juice, acv, turmeric paste (turmeric, warm water & tea tree oil)

4120 2018-09-30 22:14:09 Me acuerdo en el rodrigazo mi viejo le echava gas oil o kerosene y bolitas de naftalina, al viejo Plymount modelo 40, y se las bancaba...cada uno tenia una receta distinta para palear la crisis. hoy el kerosene y el gas oil valen todos casi igual, Ahhhhh era un gobierno PERONISTA
4121 2018-09-30 22:13:51 Bio oil podobno
4122 2018-09-30 22:13:44 fuck every single car I have is due for a oil change 
4123 2018-09-30 22:13:43 So where as ThatYellerFlash uses knives on comics, this guy breaks out baby oil snd vaseline.
4124 2018-09-30 22:13:38 Hell no. A lot of modern engines burn a little oil. Hell my Skyline does but the engine is very healthy (touch wood ). I was just stating that that's where the oil would come from if it was evident at the exhaust.
4125 2018-09-30 22:13:31 Do they treat that with strong antibiotics? Try anyway to add some drops with CBD oil! Cos it is marvelous in all Infections & even the horrible autoimune diseases it can do wonders cos it Fix some broken links in the body.!
4126 2018-09-30 22:13:26 Hey poor Nancy collects only a $193k+ salary?! For all her hard work and dedication, it should be much higher! With her skills, imagine how much she'd earn in the private sector selling snake oil or maybe vacuums door to door!
4127 2018-09-30 22:13:26 They're embroiled with Amina's Dubai trip ...
4128 2018-09-30 22:13:23 The good ship S.S. Crossing the Aisle set sail long ago and subsequently pulled a Costa Concordia as far as I'm concerned
4129 2018-09-30 22:13:17 The truth and @PressSec mix less well than oil and water.
4130 2018-09-30 22:13:16 Damn kids done got my coconut oil 
4131 2018-09-30 22:12:57 My lower division football club has won more games at Lucas Oil Stadium than the Colts
4132 2018-09-30 22:12:57 Also, more oil and gas means less coal.
4133 2018-09-30 22:12:54 I've been asleep like 70% of the day today lol
4134 2018-09-30 22:12:53 Just had motor oil and dirt splash in my mouth. Spicy
4135 2018-09-30 22:12:51 Yeah I’ve noticed everything I previously loved has either canola or soybean oil as well. It’s like we’re being collectively poisoned
4136 2018-09-30 22:12:51 A car oil kink
4137 2018-09-30 22:12:28 It is crap. Having oil inflated the strength of the £ killing UK post industrial manufacturing exports.

Oil accounts for less than 5% UK GDP.
4138 2018-09-30 22:12:22 Don't be overcomplicating something as simple as KSA/UAE supplying oil to China using the 1Road and China supplying world via Pak. Investments should be welcomed. Indian POV is opposite!
Simple, see?
4139 2018-09-30 22:12:15 i need to purchase more argan oil for my skin because i basically ran out
4140 2018-09-30 22:12:07 And that isn't even counting the oil / natural gas / steam.
4141 2018-09-30 22:12:07 If you’re looking for a relaxing time with a naughty ending get some massage oil kat will be over to ful fill your dreams 
Follow@katgainz 
She’ll be more than happy to serve your needs 

4142 2018-09-30 22:11:57 I agree nuts & oil, if included, be within a dietary pattern. Simply 'adding nuts & oil' would  calories & without substitution (cutting out something else) can contribute to XS wt gain. I do not believe they provide satiety in their own merit to overall calories.
4143 2018-09-30 22:11:54 And I didn’t get the text because i was in the barn. Then Katie didn’t answer when I called bc she’s probably napping or drinking and it’s ok bc now I’m getting olive oil to spray on my horse for his photo shoot. Our friendship is entirely functional.
4144 2018-09-30 22:11:38 Boy, he's really sharpened up his snake oil sales pitch. Hits all the DEM anchor words and fallacies.
4145 2018-09-30 22:11:29 I feel like massaging someone’s daughter. If you have baby oil just link me 
4146 2018-09-30 22:11:25 My mom used to clean houses and always washed the wood floors with Murphy's oil soap. Her customers would comment on how their wood floors had such a warm glow to them. It has a nice scent too.
4147 2018-09-30 22:11:24 Exactly my thoughts. It couldn't simply be a coincidence. Someone, somewhere is bent on ensuring that attention shifts to the politically motivated unrest and the latest findings about the General forgotten.
4148 2018-09-30 22:11:22 No one here is “blaming marginalized groups for their marginalization”. There mightvjust literally not be a lot of female oil mining board directors. Not every imbalance is due to sexism

4150 2018-09-30 22:11:11 Gabe ran out of coconut oil in August
4151 2018-09-30 22:11:10 @iammrssamuels tried a @NotForLazyMoms recommendation for an essential oil to help a cough subside for my babies. It worked within a matter of minutes. The hubs even commented on how quickly it worked. I am now a believer!  Thank you. #NFLM

Outside of crude oil and gas, we have what it takes %97 to build the land of BIAFRA @radiobiafralive.

4157 2018-09-30 22:09:05 I think its time for your oil change!
4158 2018-09-30 22:09:03 I guess but isn't this just basic stuff out of the GMing 101 handbook? If he can go out and find an actual defenceman that fits their needs, some time over the next month or so, I'll give him all the credit in the world.

4162 2018-09-30 22:08:16 You are obviously a shill and defender of US thieving oil companies lying and dumbing down or numbing Canadians. . Canada does NOT have it's own oil company. The Premier of Alberta said on air that we were getting less than $40 a barrel allot less. Why would the Premier lie?
4163 2018-09-30 22:08:14 No one is telling you one bad fact about olive oil: it's very hard for our body to digest it.
4164 2018-09-30 22:08:00 Damn woman, 
Leave sum for the ol imagination. Lil Andy needs to focus and your babblin all that crazy talk again. Why dont'cha come on inside and rub sum that squirrel oil my back?

4165 2018-09-30 22:07:44 Sundays are for being productive and taking care of yourself. 
Oil- changed 
Nails- done
Margarita & chips and salsa- consumed
4166 2018-09-30 22:07:43 Sorry to hear this, Richard. Thoughts are with you.
4167 2018-09-30 22:07:34 ~ apply tea tree oil to your cleansers to help with acne 
~ don’t wear your hair in a ponytail for too long ( or use scrunchies ( they are not as hard on your hair))
~ shave with coconut oil 
~ use honey  , lemon , and sugar to make a lip/body scrub
4168 2018-09-30 22:07:21 I love How to Eat! It was exciting different and I use it now for go-to favourites. I also love Snake Oil. Brilliant, honest, challenging and compassionate. You both look very happy, and that is with you forever xxx
4169 2018-09-30 22:07:19 The fatty acid profile of canola/rapeseed and peanut oils is very similar to that of olive oil in terms of SFA/MUFA/PUFA. Olive oil often contains slightly more Ω-6 than canola or peanut, so why are all seed oils bad?
4170 2018-09-30 22:07:15 グワーッ！！
4171 2018-09-30 22:07:13 #49ers cant tackle for shit! Do they rub lube and baby oil on there arms before the game?
4172 2018-09-30 22:07:13 That peppermint oil do my roots so nice 
4173 2018-09-30 22:07:05 i saw a doctor & had to take medication for a bit and I’m still using an antibiotic gel - apart from that I wash my face with a tea tree cleanser + Kate Somerville cleanser every night & use an oil free moisturiser before bed. I also don’t wear foundation unless I really have to!
4174 2018-09-30 22:07:04 มาว~~
4175 2018-09-30 22:07:04 Yet, here you are, using a barrel of oil to tell everyone else to stop using oil. 

In reality, you are saying that you have enough oil for yourself and no one else deserves any. Just imaging the number of people this gas can save from death in places they don't have electricity.
4176 2018-09-30 22:06:51 I should oil my motorcycle... #MinkBot
4177 2018-09-30 22:06:35 whenever im watching a skincare routine video and they bring out a jar of coconut oil i press back so fast i can feel my pores getting clogged just from watching that
4178 2018-09-30 22:06:33 The oil is heavier than gas I guess
4179 2018-09-30 22:06:12 Dear Mr President, I hope that you will soon put the pressure on the oil scheich of the Saudis,Please destroy these primitive people,  it is your oil and the fortune is yours
4180 2018-09-30 22:06:11 Nobody knows if the man is dead or who killed him. His life is just as precious as the lives of the 15 people murdered in that community in cold blood by "unknown gunmen". The women were wailing cos they know their community will bear the brunt of blind violence

4184 2018-09-30 22:05:36 I think we have 2 very different opinions on d definition of “standard” & “quality”. Iran has the largest oil&gas resources in the World. Yes, in the World. Life quality should have been way better than what is now. Estimations show every Iranian annual salary could be $ 80,000.
4185 2018-09-30 22:05:09 The positive my friend, the Canucks should be in the running for the 1st overall pick at the 2019 Draft.

4187 2018-09-30 22:04:59 It was indeed. Smart.
4188 2018-09-30 22:04:52 Our oil production can't keep up because there is insufficient infrastructure available due to regulations but that's all changing and there is now a construction frenzy to catch up to independently supply our own energy needs, then prices drop because supply n demand

4192 2018-09-30 22:04:39 He wasn’t a PTO.
4193 2018-09-30 22:04:33 Ireland sold off her oil fields for ....nothing...zero...beat that
4194 2018-09-30 22:04:29 YES hot oil merecik di mukaku 
4195 2018-09-30 22:04:22 Charge them, trade defense for cash or oil. Leave if they do not supply our needs.
4196 2018-09-30 22:04:14 They hire one anyway to meet the law, otherwise they face penalty. When I was graduating high school, a large oil company came to me and offered a scholarship, or a job. The reason? I'm part Aboriginal, and they wanted to meet unspoken "quotas" of hires with aboriginal ancestry.

4199 2018-09-30 22:04:03 It’s all about competing now. But the Colts are at best a year away. Can’t get comfortable with losing—and I doubt Luck is— but perspective: Colts have a GM and coach taking it the right direction. Luck looked physically better today. Things at Lucas Oil looking up.

4203 2018-09-30 22:03:46 Time to re-read 'Crash of '79' .  If you will recall, in a mid east nuclear exchange, no one understands why the Israeli's jacketed their device with strontium, dropped on the Arabian oil fields. My how times change. #PaulErdman.

4212 2018-09-30 22:02:29 The Carr needs a oil change
4213 2018-09-30 22:02:28 The source for the NewsMax article, Oil World offers a number of different views on this subject.  None of the articles reach the substantive conclusion that the article attributes to Oil World.  

If it happens, then, I will believe.  Until then....

4217 2018-09-30 22:01:54 For one celeb-selfie with refugees, @BarackObama should remember all his lies + propagandas with globalist media & Hollywood scums terrorists huggers regime change bullshit for oil to trade legally,

4218 2018-09-30 22:01:49 I’m so obsessed with lime essential oil. It changed my life and I can’t drink anything now without putting a drop of lime in it.
4219 2018-09-30 22:01:42 Welp, Timmy and I just caught up on the #SNLPremiere. We both give it about a 3 out of 5. Surprisingly strong cold open (was maybe just a TAD too long, though), good pre-tapes, Driver’s oil baron, uh...boobs. Only the BK Joe/lazy rewrite and Kanye failed do much for us.
4220 2018-09-30 22:01:41 And all three major oil pipeline companies have either sold or want to sell their CDN assets.

4225 2018-09-30 22:01:09 He's mentally ill. We're being "led," represented, by a man who is mentally ill, and the oligarchs (oil men, bankers, Wall St) & their tools do not care one bit.
4226 2018-09-30 22:01:08 Sshhhh. Don’t jinx it. NAFTA not done yet. And Weaver already said the Greens won’t support the LNG legislation. So he might call non-confidence vote and election. Or at the very least, we can expect protesters, court cases and endless delays, just like the oil pipeline debacle.
4227 2018-09-30 22:01:06 No. He hasn’t a clue. And neither does anyone who tweets in support of his nonsense.

4230 2018-09-30 22:00:49 He did change his oil.....
4231 2018-09-30 22:00:31 Because we use olive oil and not butter. Literally that's the only reason. Using one fat over another doesn't mean the other is bad, it just means different regions have different culinary habits.

4241 2018-09-30 22:00:04 I love the feeling of soothing chap sticks with coconut oil, beeswax and essential oils in them.
4242 2018-09-30 21:59:54 Only applies to oil
4243 2018-09-30 21:59:41 The really toxic Oil Sands crude Oil from Canada is largely exported out of the United States. All pipelines leak, its a matter of 'when'. 1,000 gallons of Oil Sands crude oil leaked into the Ogallala Aquifer = $1 Trillion in Clean Up Costs.
4244 2018-09-30 21:59:40 They are American in name only. They don’t want what’s best for America, why the hell would I want anything to do with that or them. They have made known that they hate me and my kind, so right back at’em

4252 2018-09-30 21:59:08 Not everyone is blessed with oil luke plus the UAE has significantly contributed to the widespread famine by bombing and blockading Yemen.

4254 2018-09-30 21:59:02 We have that here too. Manna Bakery has fancy olive oil.
4255 2018-09-30 21:58:51 Here's a simple delicious recipe for tomato and cucumber salad. A little lemon juice, olive oil, salt and pepper and add in some diced pickled jalapeño and cilantro. If you didn't pickle your own jalapeños like me, store bought is fine

4258 2018-09-30 21:57:49 I finally bought an essential oil diffuser, my room smells great and I feel super relaxed.
4259 2018-09-30 21:57:49 Public is the key word..
Its sad, how little public outrage there is over Trudeau using tax $ to build infrastructure for oil companies, instead of the public. Not to mention his “Infrastructure Bank” gravy train corporate welfare program bs
4260 2018-09-30 21:57:37 someone recommended bio oil x
4261 2018-09-30 21:57:33 Its 2018 and we still use oil ? Why ? When we can use other materials for the same purposes .
4262 2018-09-30 21:57:27 As Stauffer had hinted at for some time now, the deal all but certainly had an out clause that allowed the player to go to Europe instead of the AHL. My guess, it was a stipulation both sides wanted. Just my two cents.

4264 2018-09-30 21:56:59 not dry ass scalp. Where’s the oil

4267 2018-09-30 21:56:45 So signing a PTO, which literally every GM signs numerous of every single offseason. Lets give Chiarelli credit for coloring inside the lines
4268 2018-09-30 21:56:42 God you’re good...I’d prefer to listen to the billionaire investor who’s warning that if Scotland becomes independent and takes our oil revenue with us the UK will fold financially. Get someone else to feed yer ego bud

4270 2018-09-30 21:56:28 They are not fighting Boko Haram so there will be peace in Nigeria.Who cares about peace in Nigeria, they want to sell weapons and make money. What will gladden their heart more is the whole country at war. They are never at war in a country without oil or trade value.
4271 2018-09-30 21:55:57 Respectfully disagree here. When the jar of oil was brought to Jesus the apostles wanted to sell it and give the money to the poor, but Jesus allowed the woman to anoint him with it. Beauty in the liturgy is just one way we can anoint Jesus when he is present in the Eucharist.
4272 2018-09-30 21:55:51 Seems a pipe dream at this point 
4273 2018-09-30 21:55:46 All modern news articles ARE a SNL skit.
4274 2018-09-30 21:55:32 Yeah.  I hope they will find a replacement for Matt Damon playing Marc Rich in "The King of Oil."  Sadly, though, the left almost requires actors to slam all things Trump while they alienate more than half of the population.
4275 2018-09-30 21:55:26 It's like when you saw your teacher out grocery shopping in grade school, it's so EFFING CRAZY
4276 2018-09-30 21:55:16 Black kills of the penalty. Back to full strength.
4277 2018-09-30 21:54:53 There seems to be a communication problem with AB. Yesterday, someone - who said was living in Calgary - was contesting that AB's oil (bitumen) is extracted from tar sands (or oil sands). People had to explain & come up with sources about AB's oil industry.
4278 2018-09-30 21:54:53 Just flipped through People while waiting for an oil change today
4279 2018-09-30 21:54:40 He gaves that money back, everyone knows that case in Brazil. 

You live in a CNN (or Globo) box... 

The other party stole trillions of our oil state company, used our enterprise bank to send money to dicactorships and made agreements with FARC (biggest continent droug dealer)

4284 2018-09-30 21:53:34 We had better ask all the Polynesians and South Pacificers who consume much coconut oil why they’re still alive? And thriving?
4285 2018-09-30 21:53:32 Agree.They come for the safety net. Free health care homes and benefits.why would they work.they create nothing in their own countries. If Arabs had no oil the middle East would be like africa.when did you ever buy the arab invented anything? Think about it. Nothing at all ever !

4287 2018-09-30 21:52:59 Rob, I agree that it is hard to “stop on a dime” and “ease up”, but I hope you’re not saying it in this particular circumstance. Between Wilson’s history and the obvious intent to destroy his man on this play, it’s garbage like this that needs to be fixed.
4288 2018-09-30 21:52:59 Nope. Fuck the left. Every last filthy one of them.

4292 2018-09-30 21:52:26 My favorite veggies to roast are root veggies! Potato, beets, and carrots mixed together is very with good olive oil and salt. Also, carrots roasted alone with a little bit of brown sugar and cinnamon is delicious.

4296 2018-09-30 21:52:08 @mollywood @kairyssdal re: comment in episode 82 about Tesla’s lasting legacy being the spurring of EV competition; yes, that was the stated reason for Musk supposedly open-sourcing his parents in 2014. The idea being that he alone couldn’t produce enough E-cars to kill oil.
4297 2018-09-30 21:52:04 I remember when I was bald, I couldn’t wait for my hair to grow back! I used to massage my scalp w/Jamaica Black castor oil 2x/week. Now I strongly dislike doing my hair.

4302 2018-09-30 21:51:35 Love love love!!!!! I might pick up another oil when I'm down there in a couple weeks. I miss being able to drive and come get a coffee cake muffin and a cold brew whenever I wanted. Now it's a treat!!!

4304 2018-09-30 21:51:01 It's marketing disguised as news...from a broadcast company that employed Matt Lauer. Remember him? He was the guy who would ensnare unwitting women in his office by using a secret door lock installed in his desk. #NBC #MoralSuperiors

4314 2018-09-30 21:49:55 Since the poverty rate in WV has gotten worse under you are you paying people more there to attend the Snake Oil Show.
4315 2018-09-30 21:49:51 Oh dear. Someone doesn’t understand oil and whisky revenues. Or how U.K. prime ministers have used every trick in the book to stop independence....

4321 2018-09-30 21:49:16 Is it steam powered as once the zombies arrive there will be no one to refine oil so supplies will be limited to military and important services.

4332 2018-09-30 21:48:25 I was beaten to it! Lol I was gonna suggest tripling or quadrupling whatever you charged for the oil because you know the magpie like fellas who like their shinies will pay for it.

4360 2018-09-30 21:45:07 Unless you know Venezuelans who set policy that means very little to this discussion. Oil is not their only industry that is true, but how much of their revenue came from oil? That same revenue funded the subsidies from the government and when the money vanished led to collapse

4372 2018-09-30 21:44:14 I’m done with this thread. Keep thinking creating batteries and using our electrical grid is better for the environment than using oil and gas. It isn’t, and you can find great information regarding this. Or, just believe the mainstream media. Learn to learn.

4385 2018-09-30 21:41:31 With the proposed acquisition of $MEG by $HSE, this should give a boost to some of the other smaller names in the heavy oil sector. Nice premium, but investors will lose the leverage to the upside. Should be good for names like $PXX & $PGF, and even $GXE, $ATH, $BTE.
4386 2018-09-30 21:41:30 To be perfectly honest, I've studied engineering with a dream that I'll work in #Oil industry such as #Schlumberger #BakerHughes, alas, things went wrong in a country like #Yemen thus, we ended up in #humanitarian #relief and #disaster #recovery it becomes our life now.
4387 2018-09-30 21:41:27 So I’m at jiffy lube just tryna get my oil change right. The dude keeps coming in and out pretending like my cars done to joke around. It’s not even funny no more...if he don’t just go in there and finish already....

4403 2018-09-30 21:39:37 Your standard of living is probably ok. You're retired, had a good job, and enjoyed the oil boom years.
You're also probably much older than the average voter and standards of living vary accordingly.

4406 2018-09-30 21:39:30 Dude the thing happened in the news and then--brace yourself now--the SNL people did a SKIT about that thing. And--hold on before you fall down--they really didn't hold back.

4409 2018-09-30 21:39:01 My favorite thing about going in for an oil change is the upsale at the end... Like, thank you for the $800+ estimate you gave for the work "needed" on my car, but did you add the coupon I had to make this $30 transaction cheaper? Please be sure you do, thanks! #pepboys #carcare

4413 2018-09-30 21:38:29 You are such a positive voice in debunking myths and calling out the snake oil claims of jade eggs and winter vaginas. I hope you can also speak out against the quackery and snake oil claims of circumcision. Genital cutting of a healthy infant is unethical. #i2

4421 2018-09-30 21:37:59 Don't disagree with you but it is at the point where the league needs to decide what they want to do with hitting. Far too many think it is easy to just stop on a dime and ease up on a guy and it's not but as you said, the damage being done from these hits is obvious.
4422 2018-09-30 21:37:35 Yes, but look at firms in other highly profitable industries, such as oil and gas. They lobby for subsidies and privileges but don't espouse that particular, hard-left ideology. That can't be the complete explanation.

4444 2018-09-30 21:34:37 Natural from Holland and Barrett CBD oil. Put under tongue in drops before bed. Rescue remedy is also good. Again drops. Also Lavender oil, few drops on pillow. Very calming x
4445 2018-09-30 21:34:10 So much nonsense and ignorance in the replies. I live in Midland, Texas and we have been working up to this for 10 years. It didn’t just happen under Trump. I expect prices to decrease soon. We are not and have not ever been close to running out of oil. 100 yr supply.
4446 2018-09-30 21:34:02 I bought brand new tan Nikes yesterday and the server at brunch spilt red soup and oil all over them and my jeans, then the lady took my food before I finished  needless to say I cried in the middle of brunch today
4447 2018-09-30 21:33:44 They have all the oil in the world let them use it to buy arms and equipment and pay for our protection. There is no other way.

4457 2018-09-30 21:32:43 They live in a world filled with fear, hence their desperate need to believe in a "savior" like Trump. Their decisions are the result of being constantly afraid, to the point they'll believe whatever snake oil they're being sold. It is actually quite sad.

4477 2018-09-30 21:30:29 Completely agree with Julie.  CBD oil didn't work for me either but definitely worth a try.  I first tried the Holland and Barrett version but that was really weak so I would avoid that.

4490 2018-09-30 21:28:29 Scotland get 60% of what it raises back through Barnett formula the U.K. treasury keep rest - scotland has no borrowing powers since 1707 - scotland by law has to balance it books every year - scotland has a £436 m underspend last year - labour has squandered years of oil money
4491 2018-09-30 21:28:12 I get that. I think this is a bad idea, just because they aren’t many female ______ (oil miners? Idk) doesn’t necessarily mean there is sexism occurring.

4499 2018-09-30 21:26:51 Look at the bright side, you can buy oil from Russia. However, I don't believe they would trust you to keep your end of the bargain. So, embargo Iranian oil, and wonder why the price is going up.
4500 2018-09-30 21:26:41 Had a '16 2.7 EB.  Had the cylinder heads replaced at 1200 miles per the TSB. Plenty of power to pull the camper but way too light. Have an '18 F250 now. Best decision ever. The 2.7 would either burn a quart of oil or none at all. Weird.

4503 2018-09-30 21:26:15 Stupid tweet . What you are saying is if Kenya decides to sell its oil even before the oil market come as close as possible to being influenced by the forces of supply and demand as implying to lower oil prices, that Kenya should not be paid for that oil sold.

verse, but I've read it in this month's readings. Perhaps the

CofE think anointing with oil should be kept for the extreme

situations. However, it is also used in the Welcome service

at our church!

4525 2018-09-30 21:23:30 Are you joking? Animal fat? Palm oil? No thanks
4526 2018-09-30 21:23:16 Agreed but the fan in me doesn't want to see that, lol. Gotta say, this afternoon has been awfully disappointing but all but guarantee us those two Game 163's #FingersCrossed

this judge is corrupt.
someone paid off his ~200K debt in 2017. he says Trump cant be summoned or questioned !!! he is the puppet of rich people.
4547 2018-09-30 21:20:34 This evenings story is about breaking the laws of physics , when oil can both contract and expand due to political intent, you have just entered the aye right zone.

4549 2018-09-30 21:19:58 And it’s the perfect season to pair those gorgeous beans with cubes of pumpkin squash sautéed in olive oil, garlic, parsley and basil:-)

4563 2018-09-30 21:18:00 Credit for what exactly Kurt? The Jerabek signing was worth trying and if it didn't work no biggie. That said I still maintain taking Aberg instead of a late-round pick was a poor decision. Not sure to what you are referring to.
4564 2018-09-30 21:17:52 It is not weird for any objective assessors, just ask the major oil producing companies in Nigeria what was the situation before him and the situation today with their JV cashcall situations. It is like magic, they are far better situation today.
4565 2018-09-30 21:17:43 E45! Strong and simple. And any kind of oil (coconut is nice) after shower. (Both normally sold at airport!)
4566 2018-09-30 21:17:42 I forget not everyone lives in the North Bay like me and that fire pits are not always a great idea....even if it involves tenderly based with coconut oil for crispy skin pork.

4574 2018-09-30 21:16:41 I gently clean out your ears with extra virgin olive oil. My ear surgeon recommended this on my last visit . I am due to see him again. Trouble with your ears wear ear plugs when flying. Try not to put anything in your ears as it is the worse thing if you have a ear problem.

4579 2018-09-30 21:15:53 I have no clue what happened. The entire field just went... straight, lol. I'm honestly wondering if there was some oil residue on track right there from Stenhouse or another damaged vehicle.

4592 2018-09-30 21:14:31 Ocean access is to get you out, not your oil. We can still stop tankers from plying our waters.

4617 2018-09-30 21:12:25 It’s not quite that simple, for one thing, I cover renewables as well as the electric grid with its various sources, utility companies, regulators and policy issues.

The only main commodity (Oil) which US buys from Nigeria is now massively produced by the same US. Not a single sale of our oil to them in recent yrs

4632 2018-09-30 21:10:30 The Made in Canada oil price was clearly a mistake, as was the idea that the federal government could tax AB’s oil. But, Canada’s largest integrated oil company (Suncor/Petro-Can) is a direct and good result.
4633 2018-09-30 21:10:30 Yeah, I think most people just don't know to try it, that it tastes way better.  Mayo is made of oil, that's why it works.

4674 2018-09-30 21:06:45 Israel controls Arab nations. More over, banks protect Israeli interests and therefore all others must follow suit. It's more about money & power than religion. Israel & West must fabricate a villian for them to gain oil/land/resources in Middle East.

4677 2018-09-30 21:06:28 China is moving in the right direction. We are moving in the wrong direction. Get it? China can admit that green is the only way forward. Usa hasnt. Get it? A radical?  Lol. You want to dictate oil, coal, and nuclear...which gives all power to oligarchs.
4678 2018-09-30 21:06:20 Hope mine last this long! Only added an oil catch can for peace of mind. Had to replace the brake master cylinder, but engine has been bullet proof and always pulls strong.
4679 2018-09-30 21:06:17 When I have a salad I drizzle it with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Job done and delicious!
4680 2018-09-30 21:06:17 @keselowski can drive on oil. Take it to them @MonsterMile #NASCARPlayoffs #CheckersOrWreckers
4681 2018-09-30 21:06:01 Oil supply has been used to drive up price for along time now, causing
market to go up and down like a roller coaster. It is all driven by greedy shareholders and the exec.'s whose positions of power is controlled by the shareholders.
4682 2018-09-30 21:06:00 Vivement l'arrivée de Oil

4684 2018-09-30 21:05:54 This documentary #Killercurves on @BET_Intl is crazy. People really putting car oil and poly filler in their bums? We are living in sad times. Ladies love yourself 
4685 2018-09-30 21:05:51 Consumers read labels,palm oil don't buy
4686 2018-09-30 21:05:10 Baba they were special forces fa very tall with mask, rumors had it that BH were in school, they chased us from classes
4687 2018-09-30 21:05:06 Just wondering if there was oil on the track, stenhouse had just spun there and crashed
4688 2018-09-30 21:05:05 Nobody has time for #headaches & #migraines. Using #magnesium oil can reduce the frequency of migraines! #sunday #weekend #naturalpainrelief #holistichealth
4689 2018-09-30 21:05:04 Hunters Dry is castor oil that tastes better
4690 2018-09-30 21:05:00 Someone’s saying oil????
4691 2018-09-30 21:04:49 I think it's pretty fair to think as we want to dial down oil usage that funding of a replacement green energy industry would be smart. Sure we have some of the best med schools in the country, and other world best industies. The engery sector is still huge.
4692 2018-09-30 21:04:42 Probably from the 17 or 51, nascar probably didn't clean up high where the 51 was and may have left some oil on the track
4693 2018-09-30 21:04:36 I was thinking oil or something  but idk
4694 2018-09-30 21:04:36 never had one with oil :O
4695 2018-09-30 21:04:32 I remember seeing someone on here who made essential oil rollers with flowers/crystals in them? If anyone knows who I'm talking about, let me know  (I probably shouldn't spend the money but look @ me trying to spend the money)
4696 2018-09-30 21:04:21 We haven’t won in Lucas Oil since….*draws blank*
4697 2018-09-30 21:04:20 I use mac fix plus after using powder and it makes skin super dewy. You can also use a drop of oil in your foundation if your skin isnt too oily
4698 2018-09-30 21:04:16 Man fuck Synthetic oil  paying more to drive 2k more miles 
4699 2018-09-30 21:04:10 Put some Oil on that bitch it will open
4700 2018-09-30 21:03:57 This unrest in Jos is just a way of deviating and dividing the attention of the security forces from dealing with those blood sucking monsters who have refused peace.
Pls @HQNigerianArmy deal with them ruthlessly !!!
4701 2018-09-30 21:03:47 Aren't lactating mothers supposed to avoid peanuts and tree nuts (and products thereof)? I seem to recall the theory that one theory re the increase in peanut allergies was that a lot of women used peanut oil to prevent nipple cracking.
4702 2018-09-30 21:03:31 Don't think maybe stenhouse spilled oil on that last caution?
4703 2018-09-30 21:03:30 Is ondo state and lagos on the same level my stubborn head 
The reason ondo has not develop with all the cocoa and oil money is the social nobody can control us

If you really love your state you will seek development and progress

4714 2018-09-30 21:02:32 I think there had to have been oil
4715 2018-09-30 21:02:22 NASCAR is getting slick. First we had traction compound to help the racing now we have artificials oil downs to shake things up.
4716 2018-09-30 21:02:14 @LOSdotOrg Apparently maybe some oil done by time Blaney got to that area.
4717 2018-09-30 21:02:09 I cannot believe what I just witnessed in Lucas Oil Stadium
4718 2018-09-30 21:02:07 @NASCAR so the #ROVAL can be an elimination race but talladega can’t?? Smh
4719 2018-09-30 21:02:07 MIRACLE IN THE OIL LANDS!!!! 
4720 2018-09-30 21:02:05 Had to be oil
4721 2018-09-30 21:02:01 I've always been bothered by the amount of oil she uses especially coupled with how flimsy the dishes she uses to deliver the food.
4722 2018-09-30 21:01:56 That skit where he played the oil baron dad slayed me.
4723 2018-09-30 21:01:55 My little sisters came over my house thinking they were getting their hair touched up.  NOPE! Here’s the coconut oil, now grease my scalp boo.

4727 2018-09-30 21:01:40 You're right, we have tackle the issue of oil by rail.  It's been ignored for way too long.  #StopKM #stopline3 #tarsands
4728 2018-09-30 21:01:35 I’m starting to make my own salad dressing too. My fridge looks like a condiment store so many sauces and premade crap.  I have oil and a whole munch of vinegars and almost every spice or herb you can imagine so why not  things are so much better made from scratch
4729 2018-09-30 21:01:35 @Headshoulders hi can you please stop using palm oil in your products your the only shampoo that works for my dandruff but I’ll stop if the palm oil continues
4730 2018-09-30 21:01:34 I couldnt get past the taste and felt sick every time i tried it. So then looked at other products. Vape oil, capsules, even gummy bears. Ive tried different products, different strengths, different suppliers and I’m still no further forward but a lot poorer.
4731 2018-09-30 21:01:33 There is not one country who is moved away from oil and maybe one day that will happen but that is a long way off. Other economies are getting bigger but none touch our country even China’s and they have five times our population.
4732 2018-09-30 21:01:30 Tuned in to @NASCAR for the last 10 laps, just to see how the #ROVAL was going to work out in the closing laps. @woodbrothers21 gets into oil on the restart and sucked into the tire wall.

4733 2018-09-30 21:01:28 I really love your artwork it's so inspiring. How do you get your digital work to look like a traditional oil paiting? I feel like I can smell that paint.
4734 2018-09-30 21:01:24 Natural gas not oil
4735 2018-09-30 21:01:24 Turmoil. It’s fun to plan together and take turns drilling for oil or running the wagons to get it sold.
4736 2018-09-30 21:01:22 I still laugh at the phrase “Snoke Oil Salesmen”.
4737 2018-09-30 21:01:21 The Romans tried to make them a lot more str8 than they were when in reality they all had the big gay

In fact, did u know that the reason olive oil thrived so much in Greece is literally because it was a fantastic lube back during that time for 
4738 2018-09-30 21:01:17 I need some pineapple oil. That shit at the nail salon smelled amazing and I didn’t feel greasy like I do with normal oils

4742 2018-09-30 21:01:09 He got away with his bad behavior, but he didn’t last long—Arizona and SF like oil and water. In the end I think it was an alpha male competition thing that did him in, not his clueless misogyny.
4743 2018-09-30 21:01:07 I guess they could always bid for the 2030 games if oil prices pick up more or the TV rights get richer.
4744 2018-09-30 21:01:00 England's national descent under a Westminster government. Europeans know who the real architects of the UK's madness are. Racists and Little Englanders with more toes than IQ being spoon fed propaganda by snake oil salesmen. Not my country.

4748 2018-09-30 21:00:38 The oil market hasn't had a real bear market since 2000. Just before 2014 could be considered real, it started to jump up.
4749 2018-09-30 21:00:33 @mmschocolate hi can you stop using palm oil in your products ? Pls
4750 2018-09-30 21:00:28 We won't stop at ending drilling for unusable new supplies. We won't stop at empowering millions of families with solar and wind. We will only stop when we give up the routine combustion of oil and gas, and commit to survival instead of convenience. That's #MakingOilHistory

4762 2018-09-30 20:59:13 Congrat’s Eric. Looks like those 3k miles caused your carburetor, battery and oil pressure to be in need of service. Make sure your seatbelt gets checked as that shows an issue also.  Miss ya buddy!
4763 2018-09-30 20:59:09 If am correct, Prophet Muhammad was so patriotic that Saudi would still be rich without oil, by his condition for every Muslim to visit mecca, y the fellow muslim fail accepting good things,
4764 2018-09-30 20:59:01 What is happening at Lucas Oil? Come on man! #Colts
4765 2018-09-30 20:58:57 (You seriously don’t want your capitalist little hands on all that oil and gas that’s just been discovered to the west of Shetland?)
4766 2018-09-30 20:58:57 going to not be able to sleep thinking my shitty improvised front wheel stand collapsed and my motorcycle is currently losing oil on the floor of the garage
4767 2018-09-30 20:58:51 in short, the oil is buried in mother earth. the question is whether we let these capitalist fucks destroy the earth & terrorize populations in order to get it. theyve already destroyed the earth’s climate after a century of extraction & exploitation #LaNeta
4768 2018-09-30 20:58:49 Macron looks like is is just about to go crazy with a bottle of baby oil! 
4769 2018-09-30 20:58:40 Hi Kate, i had heard lots of good reports and decided to give CBD a try. I have to say its quite a minefield. Without wanting to discredit anyone every company obviously want to sell their own products. If you can manage to put up with the taste of the oil then thats def best.
4770 2018-09-30 20:58:38 Holding onto Goya oil and monetary seeds more than his promises, is playing games with God.Stop the greed and serve God in truth and spirit.
4771 2018-09-30 20:58:31 I'm happy I can be a beacon of positivity and knowledge in your life! Thanks for putting up on oil pulling. I'm starting my first round tonight.

blaiir: idk the regular kind
4774 2018-09-30 20:57:37 The message I would hear if I were a progressive corporation is “you should find a free-er market to make a public offering if you don’t want roadblocks from legacy oil money. “
4775 2018-09-30 20:57:17 Fam... what is the best oil to put on your beard. SOMEBODY!!!!!

4779 2018-09-30 20:56:13 Missing and straying from the point: Oil gets subsidies and makes money. I support sustainable subsidies. The point is even WITH them TSLA loses tons.

4781 2018-09-30 20:55:14 Ever since I can remember watching the news I have always heard “diversification of the economy “. Several meetings and conferences have been held, since time immemorial, to reduce our over dependence on oil. Agriculture is always termed the ultimate solution. Still nothing...
4782 2018-09-30 20:55:13 Ehh a Tie is better than the usual loss in Lucas Oil Stadium
4783 2018-09-30 20:55:04 Idiots need to be led. Susceptible to the snake oil sale.
4784 2018-09-30 20:54:34 We had once seen how they crumbled the countries account 16 years ago, sharing the resources & oil wells here and there, the lower classess of people nigeria believe in Buhari, They knew he's not a thief...
4785 2018-09-30 20:54:33 In Lucas Oil and that dude is looking average at best.
4786 2018-09-30 20:54:30 Yes. Some jobs are dangerous. Like working on oil rigs, or on construction sites, or in the army. Still doesn't make it your choice to tell someone they cannot do their job. Do you hear yourself?
4787 2018-09-30 20:54:28 I think this was the first oil rig to be floated off at Methil...I was working in Fife at the time I guess, Linwood Hall!

Bless this day, for I am going hard on my relaxing game.
4791 2018-09-30 20:53:36 .@elonmusk I love you. You gave me hope for a planet that is being overrun by selfish oil giants who would bleed Earth dry if it fuels their private jets. If someone from Halliburton fills your chairman seat then you let me down, brother.
4792 2018-09-30 20:53:35 Put away the anointing oil. Ok? He’s good. But let’s not get crazy.

so, he will suffer in 2019.
4796 2018-09-30 20:53:15 @benandjerrys Could you please sell your peanut butter cups separately? I am addicted to them. I buy the pints of peanut fudge core mostly just to get to the peanut butter cups WITHOUT palm oil. Stopped TJ's because they have palm oil. Your does not. DELICIOUS. Please sell them!
4797 2018-09-30 20:53:14 @NutsAndBoltsSP, 1:54 left for @CaptAndrewLuck and his band of Colts.  His sidearm is pure and the squirrel oil has been applied. Let's go!!!

4798 2018-09-30 20:53:09 Lies... Just admit to us that mama knight has been putting oil in your head hence that extra glow and shine 
4799 2018-09-30 20:53:06 Pollutants are bad for our plants included along with all other life forms here, the EPA should be doing all it can to stop it.
Big oil has been knowingly killing us for years & never once thought of an alternative to fix it, exept killing better ideas.
4800 2018-09-30 20:53:00 Didn’t say it was but nuclear is Saudi Arabia’s best bet for power generation that isn’t oil or natgas. Good solid base load, plenty of space to put nuclear powerplant away from  cities, frees up oil for export esp in summer
4801 2018-09-30 20:52:59 They really playing John Cenas theme song at Lucas Oil Stadium?? lol
4802 2018-09-30 20:52:53 Believing in alternative "medicine" is harming the populace. Yes having a healthy diet and living right is key, but some herbal tea will not cure cancer! Essential oil will not cure depression! Any one who shares this garbage is killing the people who trust them!
4803 2018-09-30 20:52:51 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!
4804 2018-09-30 20:52:49 I lived in Norway until end of 2016. The government cut health and education spending during the oil crash.

In the UK our funding increased and yet the SNP still managed to move funds away from our SNHS for their nationalist agrandissement projects.
4805 2018-09-30 20:52:49 Show us the charts, as we look into your comments and find they more often are incorrect or misleading 

FYI middle class wages were reported flat by your own team, and our cost are rising 

Did you see oil $40 higher under your watch, got to pay for those weapons you sell
4806 2018-09-30 20:52:34 The way Twitter Cashivist, Opportunivist ,Ethnicivist ,Herdsivist and overlord became deaf and dumb at the wake of these Pond discovery is Amusing ,plus the media went num on this, what if it was the other way round?
4807 2018-09-30 20:52:21 Mine is a P11 opposed a later model with high level pipes. The purist would have a field day but I am a ride-ist, there are many cosmetic inaccuracies but the engine, gearbox, frame and wheels are original. So is the oil leak. 
I like the new machines.

4816 2018-09-30 20:50:22 The Syrian oil company estimated losses of 55 billion Syrian pounds since 2011.
4817 2018-09-30 20:50:13 You know that Iran cannot sell its oil, right?
4818 2018-09-30 20:50:11 I want somebody to just come rub through my braids & oil them for me it’s gone feel so good omg 
4819 2018-09-30 20:49:45 Yeah that's pretty much where I am as well.  I'll always remember this as the oil baron show and I doubt I'll remember anything else from it.  The rest was kind of the same usual stuff they do in every episode these days.
4820 2018-09-30 20:49:27 An oil rig well done
4821 2018-09-30 20:49:26 Ai that man is a bastard
4822 2018-09-30 20:49:16 aka a green light for personal corruption for the powerful, tax relief for billionaires, helping oil and gas interest live another day, drumming up racism, sexism and xenophobia while they take away health care and social security...
4823 2018-09-30 20:49:09 oh!イル
4824 2018-09-30 20:48:44 Am speechless ... As a Governor look at the way Jang  react .... Allah hoinu
4825 2018-09-30 20:48:34 when people don’t understand that mental illnesses are chemical imbalances in the brain, i usually ask them if they have ever baked a cake and left out the oil.
4826 2018-09-30 20:48:33 Thank god my heating is oil and tank filled start of summer
4827 2018-09-30 20:48:12 چطوری بگم
4828 2018-09-30 20:48:05 I thought it wasn’t the strongest premiere. Oddly enough, I felt they used Driver better his first time than his second. The oil baron sketch was far and away the highlight and showed what kind of show we could have had with more polished writing
4829 2018-09-30 20:48:03 Ask the babysitter if oil executives hide the water powered car tech from us all too. It’s always been one of my faves.

4831 2018-09-30 20:48:00 Obama was gearing up for fossil fuel maximum production for 8 years.  The Clintons paid to have people tricked into demonizing fossil fuels so we would be destroyed economically.  Did you know more oil is lost at sea every year than Canada has ever split on land?
4832 2018-09-30 20:48:00 It's a day for listening to Hole while eating my husband's ginger turmeric chicken soup with chili garlic oil.

4835 2018-09-30 20:47:47 @jkenney gives an example of how divisive a public leader he really is Why not seek out the best of our province/nation to combat climate change while finding ways for oil industry to work in harmony, we need the oil pipelines & environment working together #respect @RachelNotley
4836 2018-09-30 20:47:31 Because we have 40,000 + people illegally crossing PER MONTH. The 40,000 are just the ones caught. That's why
4837 2018-09-30 20:47:27 @ChefEneSoulfood please come and see this eguis, is the red oil not too much? I want to say my mind but I will wait for a professional like you to tell me first

4839 2018-09-30 20:47:25 Iran is sanctioned though it complied with an international agreement on its nuclear program and new sanctions were piled on top of the old sanctions. And in about five weeks the US will be sanctioning ANYONE who buys oil from Iran with no exceptions allowed. -Philip Giraldi

4843 2018-09-30 20:47:01 Carson Wentz has been sacked 9 times in 2 games since coming back.  Offensive Line can't let him get hit that much. And that's before you get to defensive problems... Just a bad loss, up 17-3 & your D continues to leak oil giving up three 4th down conversions on way to loss..
4844 2018-09-30 20:46:57 Oil is rising because we are operating on historically low levels of spare capacity into 2019.
Aside Saudi there is no spare capacity anywhere. And we still have to find 4-5mbd new supply annually just to offset natural decline rates....
 $100 oil and way higher is possible
4845 2018-09-30 20:46:49 Got an essential oil defuser for my car, upgrading my life

4852 2018-09-30 20:46:19 Cut a yam into tiny squares, sauté with onions, brown sugar, and an oil of your choice until the yams are slightly soft, add a can of chickpeas (with juice), cook for 5 more minutes on the stove, sprinkle more brown sugar to taste over top, put in the oven at 350 for 10 minutes
4853 2018-09-30 20:46:16 Awesomeness!!
4854 2018-09-30 20:46:16 Not being funny but shes no oil painting now and unlikely to have been back then.......Could it have been fight back for rejection on her part!!!!!....just saying!!!
4855 2018-09-30 20:46:11 I like how things are going in the oil rich Venezuela.
I like what it has done in Cuba.
I like the 100,000,000 murdered in China.
I like ... in every case, every case.
4856 2018-09-30 20:46:09 Whaaaat?! That's ridiculous and gross. I do have legit questions about lavender/tea tree oil effects on gynocomastia but only bc I finally got top surgery and I don't want to deal with that again. But legit sources of information on this are scarce

4863 2018-09-30 20:45:08 You are right.  Our children in Batti grow their own in Gardening Club.  We planted 210 assorted fruit trees, some cashew trees and the school has a Garden.  We provide rice and oil for Free School Dinners. #childrenmatter no #malnutrition in Batti.

4870 2018-09-30 20:44:30 Hello, did you know that if Alberta was separated from Canada we would be landlocked.  According to international law and NATO, we would only be charged "Actual Expence" on oil to the USA.  In confederation we are an Ocean access country, meaning the USA can impose costs...
4871 2018-09-30 20:44:19 The NFL without Sudden Death Overtime is like Oreos without hydrogenated oil. It's not American!
4872 2018-09-30 20:44:10 What look are the girls that are carving parts of their face off going for?! I’m no oil painting but Christ it looks bad! Few years there’s going to be some really damaged girls #TOWIE
4873 2018-09-30 20:44:08 Don't rent from @foxrentcar - they gave us a dirty bottom-of-the-line minivan 6000+ miles overdue for an oil change, then they charged $8 a gallon for a full tank of gas when it was returned full. Don't forget rude counter service at the SJC location! We'll pay more elsewhere.

4876 2018-09-30 20:43:52 It's reason why Netanyahu had a count in farsi, he learnt the subtility of the language. But it seems this count disapeared, I can't find it now the arab coaliton leads the war against Iran, may be that could explain the attack in the region the most rich of oil in old Arabistan
4877 2018-09-30 20:43:43 Well done. I salute you
4878 2018-09-30 20:43:25 Yes! Hair brushing/hair cutting/oil treatments
4879 2018-09-30 20:43:17 Do you know how many women who have groped men?  I learned a lot when I got my first summer job at Shell Oil Co. I could not believe at the parties what the women were doing with the married men.  I was shocked going into the real world.
4880 2018-09-30 20:43:14 chutiyapa band karo modi ji.
4881 2018-09-30 20:42:54 Oil companies buy and sell oil. We Canadians and the Canadian government are not involved in either of these transactions.
4882 2018-09-30 20:42:52 I almost just put black currant squash into a frying pan instead of oil so my pain meds are certainly doing something
4883 2018-09-30 20:42:49 Demand they be returned to their families in South America as quickly as possible

4885 2018-09-30 20:42:43 @waitrose why do you have palm oil in your food to go wraps? I was devastated when I had just bought my Chana Masala wrap to find out this. I'm a lover of your food to go but why do you have to hurt the rain forest in the meantime?
4886 2018-09-30 20:42:32 why is @BJP4India sitting and watching????

bjp is GANDU party.
4887 2018-09-30 20:42:30 You're a snake oil salesman of the worst. Your license, if you have one, should be revoked permanently.
4888 2018-09-30 20:42:24 what’s a bigger fear for you: losing all your friends or running out of oil to grease your joints? 
4889 2018-09-30 20:42:21 Come on Lucas Oil we need the 12th man rn bc we know our defense isn't good enough to play this on their own leggggooooo Colts
4890 2018-09-30 20:42:15 Hi Brad, did you know that if Alberta was separated from Canada we would be landlocked.

4891 2018-09-30 20:42:12 I look so white tho lmaoooo

Toning cream with alive oil.  Skin smooth!!
4892 2018-09-30 20:41:53 Because when your oil level is two quarts low being called a doctor sounds cool and gives you status.
4893 2018-09-30 20:41:53 Switching to oil paint is giving a whole other level of anxiety.
4894 2018-09-30 20:41:51 Je t’ai sur insta, on s’est peut être parlé 2 fois et alors ? Nptq

4897 2018-09-30 20:41:17 Got my funnel cake and now I feel super-gross from all that powdered sugar and oil!
4898 2018-09-30 20:41:06 Lucas Oil sounds deafening
4899 2018-09-30 20:41:05 Ridged potato chips.  No funky flavors, just high quality brands using potatoes, oil and salt.
4900 2018-09-30 20:41:02 Could be true coz am only seeing the Rafa brand of cooking oil. Zvakaoma.
4901 2018-09-30 20:40:55 yerrrr. so my oil pen, how can i get through into universal w it ?
4902 2018-09-30 20:40:52 Our oil and whisky pays your taxes now piss of and make a brew.
4903 2018-09-30 20:40:41 No but I would like to because motor oil aside he is a good looking guy.

4907 2018-09-30 20:40:08 it is FAILURE of @BJP4India and @narendramodi that such insects are still roaming free and spewing filth all around.

4908 2018-09-30 20:39:48 Oil deaths 
4909 2018-09-30 20:39:46 Lol I hv a competition in sight
4910 2018-09-30 20:39:45 I haven't seen a Kramer bungle something like that since the oil tanker bladder test
4911 2018-09-30 20:39:44 Reason is there is a message circulating saying Zambians, Mozambicans are hoarding cooking oil, cereals, Pepsi etc from Harare wholesalers for resale back home using 2tonne trucks. So people are being warned of shortages & the panic buying is largely coz of that
4912 2018-09-30 20:39:41 I keep wondering why Melania wants to go to South Africa... perhaps because it's part of the globalist oil and gas route plans...
4913 2018-09-30 20:39:38 Hello, did you know that if Alberta was separated from Canada we would be landlocked.  According to international law and NATO, we would only be charged "Actual Expence" on oil to the USA.  In confederation we are an Ocean access country, meaning the USA can impose costs...
4914 2018-09-30 20:39:23 Lucas oil stadium has played wipe me down like 5-6 times today
4915 2018-09-30 20:39:21 Lucas oil still playing wipe me down every kickoff <
4916 2018-09-30 20:38:58 Is that what he's doing then?
Fighting against the intensification of oil extraction?

Why is his cause supported by the Rockefeller Foundation then?

Are you convincing yourself that your slogans are true, or did you simply never bother to consider the facts?
4917 2018-09-30 20:38:53 A very hilly course today in Reading and not one that favours me. Just outside the money in 6th place. I'll need some serious Magnesium Oil treatment tonight. Next week I hope to be back in the money for Children on the Edge. @BetterYou_Ltd @cote_uk
4918 2018-09-30 20:38:53 A pea-sized amount of baby oil can act as a shine hair serum before dashing out the door.
4919 2018-09-30 20:38:53 What?... That's too much cardio 
4920 2018-09-30 20:38:38 We both agree consumption of our own oil is important. We can't ignore macroeconomics to balance our national interests for export though. If we can't export, we actually increase the amount and cost of importing oil. It's a double whammy.
4921 2018-09-30 20:38:35 I’m glad I’m passed the point in my fitness phase where I was scared of olive oil. 
A little olive oil makes such a difference. We welcoming jooocy chicken and tasty potatoes
4922 2018-09-30 20:38:18 Yes, but at what cost? The debt increase is so severe that the US will have to do a HUGE step back in wealth and spending. Especially as the world moves away from the oil $ and other economies are getting bigger.
4923 2018-09-30 20:38:15 “Try to blow my nose but blew my mind it’s mind blowing  and gold diggers dig until they find oil “

4925 2018-09-30 20:37:34 Got an oil change, feeling better from the past couple of days, looking forward to the new coworker tomorrow! #positive
4926 2018-09-30 20:37:13 today's biggest tragedy is not having enough cooking oil to make myself some alphabet funkkcig soup 
4927 2018-09-30 20:37:07 Oil has little to do with profit, marm.
4928 2018-09-30 20:37:02 They sure didn't hurt it. Hiring a paid resource assassin to stand on a committee vital to Alberta's economy speaks volumes to Notley's commitment to oil and gas.
4929 2018-09-30 20:37:02 The market is tight based on fundamentals. For over a year, the Wall Street gang said oil would be $45-55 etc. The problem is the producing nations can’t balance their budgets at that the price. Shale oil can’t turn a profit at that level as well.
4930 2018-09-30 20:36:58 Climate change deniers have been fooled by the oil industry and your paid off politicians. 95% of climate scientists agree, 5% are either paid off or freaks.
4931 2018-09-30 20:36:49 There is a spectrum of oil consumption, which means striking a balance between what we must import (light sweet crude) and that's high we can export (heavy), so we must export some but are doing it at a substantial loss and with no foreign environmental accountability.
4932 2018-09-30 20:36:46  This isn’t cooked, but the noodles soak up the oil/vinegar stuff and get softer. Like I said, it’s best if it steeps awhile.
4933 2018-09-30 20:36:36 Tohfa as e dey hot
4934 2018-09-30 20:36:26 Well actually under article 605 of NAFTA we are required to sell oil to the us
4935 2018-09-30 20:36:18 Olive oil, my first love
4936 2018-09-30 20:36:15 They dip that ball in oil?
4937 2018-09-30 20:36:12 Like oil and water
4938 2018-09-30 20:36:05 What the hell is that brown stain on the playing field at Lucas Oil stadium? #Browns #BrownsRaiders #Oakland

4941 2018-09-30 20:35:47 Hazelnut Oil is high in essential fatty acids & is soothing to dry skin. Add 2 drops to your body scrub
4942 2018-09-30 20:35:43 Can you please tell me what you think about sunflower oil? Apparently it's @whole30 approved and I'm just trying to weed through that :-)
4943 2018-09-30 20:35:30 @RigstarTelecom  No one is answering from you Calgary office! We have an entire 24-7 oil plant without internet connection or phones!
4944 2018-09-30 20:35:20 uhhh i think it's those indian fries that look like pasta but when you drop them into oil they turn into crisps
4945 2018-09-30 20:35:08 That's in a developed country, oil and fossil fuels will still be needed for a long time to come. At least we will be refining what we use instead of importing.
4946 2018-09-30 20:35:00 Trouble goes mental if I get the grooming mit out. He loves it!  Doesn’t at all mind being washed with @animology shampoo. He is very shiny. Sardines every other day and cod liver and evening primrose oil every day.
4947 2018-09-30 20:34:47 I've got a mate who has a phobia about the barnacles on Buoys, chains, and floating things at sea..can't do with the big metal oil rigs at sea either.
4948 2018-09-30 20:34:45 And regarding subsidies: oil gets billions as does coal. Free land, rights of ways, redistributed medical costs, which is 100’s of billions. For a couple billion in EV subsidies we get national defense, billions in exports and cleaner air & better cars
4949 2018-09-30 20:34:36 Democrats and morals are like oil and vinegar
4950 2018-09-30 20:34:26 Baker Mayfield show pretty entertaining. #DraftDay
4951 2018-09-30 20:34:18 Has anyone seen Crawford without the motor oil on his hair? Anyone?
4952 2018-09-30 20:34:17 I was finally able to get it off this morning with oil based makeup remover. 
4953 2018-09-30 20:33:51 Milly too rock oil and flour.
4954 2018-09-30 20:33:47 *basically* but it’s not set in stone, 3 eggs, approx 350-450 milk, 1 cup-ish flour and salt.  Mix and rest in fridge. Heat a tiny bit of oil in tins, add mix, cook on 400 ish til brown..
4955 2018-09-30 20:33:44 Are African's especially Nigerians tapping into the revolutionary phase of making oil a none business venture come 12 years or even less than?  The SMEs will change the world's energy on the impact of ICT and idealist innovations.
4956 2018-09-30 20:33:36 true.

@BJP4India is a GANDU party, and therefore they will pay thru nose in 2019.

4958 2018-09-30 20:33:23 You might like to release the price we are currently paying for crude oil to places like the @TheAMShowNZ etc. They seem to think the Govt is totally to blame for ALL rises in petrol prices. 
They seem totally incapable of researching anything themselves so need yr guidance.

4979 2018-09-30 20:30:30 Not using our oil and using another countries makes no sense at all. Why aren't you protesting for more R&D in green tech, protesting against oil importation, protesting US sales of oil to China and India while the US simultaneously buys our oil at a discount?

4994 2018-09-30 20:28:59 You want to sell a vision? Fine. But the vision should be an articulation of sensible policy. Belittling unsexy things that work (e.g. job retraining) and promising the return of “manly” jobs in the coal mines and factory floors isn’t “vision”; it’s selling snake oil.

5013 2018-09-30 20:27:10 Why are we allowing ourselves to only having one customer for our oil?This pipeline would open new markets. What would you think if we were only able to export alternative energy products to one country?

5018 2018-09-30 20:26:36 The economics of oil price, oil subsidy, naira valuations and debt is more complicated than that. The ability, intelligence and willingness to balance all these effectively is our problem. Hence the need for credible intelligent economic minds to steer that ship.
5019 2018-09-30 20:26:34 I agree. Looting gold & diamond, big contracts but deficient output or dumping poor prdcts. Why can't they establish companies to process our agric products or manufacturing basic food products like cooking oil. So that we won't continue importing frm S.A!  WHY?
5020 2018-09-30 20:26:17 Crude oil prices have risen dramatically too ... something the @TheAMShowNZ doesn't like to mention because when it comes to talking about the Govt, they don't like to tell the truth.

El "discurso" sobre el peak oil obtiene relevancia tras la crisis del 2008 y su coincidencia con el alza de los precios del petróleo.
El proceso de abandono de energía fósil se debe a su cénit, no a que perjudica la salud.

5051 2018-09-30 20:22:22 Well we both know oil, edibles,vaping etc will not be able to be policed-impossible to detect. Smoking cannabis obviously can be. People will have to find alternatives- which there is no shortage of.  Until the stigma is gone it’s going to be a battle.

5073 2018-09-30 20:20:23 No, to make sure that we have jobs & revenue to support public services, to ensure we get a fair price for our oil, to stop importing US & other foreign oil. Why do you think it is better to consume oil from other countries and not our own? Do you think they are more responsible?

5084 2018-09-30 20:18:35 I normally agree with u but single payer can be done-severely raise taxes on the top 1-10%, & corps. Cut subsidies on oil, gas, etc. redirect the waste in current healthcare to paying for it. Yes, tax increases are probably inevitable but you can’t spend $100 if u only make $50.

5088 2018-09-30 20:16:56 Our country has invested too much in oil.  Oil that is dirty and hard to get at.  Tar sands oil is some of the hardest to mine.  Diversity is key to a good economy.  Self reliance.  Oil as energy is becoming more obselete every day.  We need to stop investing!

5095 2018-09-30 20:16:29 why cant BJP fix kejdibaal??? break his and Sunita's aand-gaand nicely.

5096 2018-09-30 20:16:23 A back massage... With oil and I mean hit every knot and tender spot in my spine

5101 2018-09-30 20:15:26 Except that in the Netherlands it was genuinely about traffic safety. Despite the oil crisis and car-free Sundays in 1973-74, there was no real gas shortage because of oil supplied from Europe, Venezuela, etc.
5102 2018-09-30 20:15:19 Neils Yard do a great Women’s balance oil blend.
5103 2018-09-30 20:15:17 The Cafe Mac Pizza this Spring Sampler will be: no crust with sweet coconut oil and meat lovers.
5104 2018-09-30 20:15:16 We are geeking out on these Greek tacos from @cleaneatsandsometreats !
.

@sietefoods almond flour tacos, @hopefoods original hummus with a little avocado oil and paprika, then a mix of Greek olives, red bell pepper, cucumber, boiled baby potatoes, feta and chopped parsley
5105 2018-09-30 20:15:16 We would love to hear from anyone treating crohn's disease with CBD oil? #CBDoil #crohns #ibs #colitis
5106 2018-09-30 20:15:08 bottles of oil mean business; trash bags mean business; therefore trash bags are bottles of oil
5107 2018-09-30 20:14:59 The Flash on his own. Very underrated hero. If he moves at light speed, everything would look to him like an oil painting. He could rearrange both of their molecular structures in less than a microsecond. Game over.
5108 2018-09-30 20:14:44 Ended up in Dunfermiline Tesco tonight.. oil light came on M90.. stressed oot ma nut. Home now.. fed and watered. #allgood

5110 2018-09-30 20:14:35 I still smile at people in passing. Weird to me that that is weird to others 
5111 2018-09-30 20:14:17 @Oil_Drop I wanted to see Scherzer in a key game, too, but I understand why the Nats decided to go another way. Imagine an injury to a $150-million player in a game that meant nothing to his team.
5112 2018-09-30 20:14:11 Ah bless i just hope the judges will enjoy my singing, scary the thought of singing in front of them
5113 2018-09-30 20:13:57 Kindness is the oil that takes the friction out of life.. Sunday thoughts from me to you
5114 2018-09-30 20:13:53 Everything she said but butter instead of oil.
5115 2018-09-30 20:13:44 And after the rain, it will take three days for the wire to dry up....
5116 2018-09-30 20:13:37 I need tea tree oil so I can get rid of pimples again
5117 2018-09-30 20:13:35 Next stop oil rigs @omarbuen98 @maximo_galvan 
5118 2018-09-30 20:13:22 Supply chain being stressed to the west - not to mention the use of land for the cattle, bet there’s a palm oil in some of the things they serve. Sorry, but if you looked at the world from space and you saw some people overly stuffing their faces while others starved - not good
5119 2018-09-30 20:13:12 I work land based oil and gas
5120 2018-09-30 20:13:09 Years ago I had someone from New York stop and ask me why I said *hello* when I didn't know him. I laughed because that was how we did it when passing someone on the street 
5121 2018-09-30 20:13:08 @jodywallace The Mercedes 240D and 300D -- the legendary "million mile" cars. They've got almost no parts susceptible to an EMP blast and can run on waist oil. We sold ours at 33 years and 270K in daily driver condition.
5122 2018-09-30 20:13:06 Had to stop and get a damn oil change I was on the roll man
5123 2018-09-30 20:12:59 The composition of olive oil varies with the cultivar, altitude, time of harvest and extraction process. It consists mainly of oleic acid (up to 83%), with smaller amounts of other fatty acids including linoleic acid (up to 21%) and palmitic acid (up to 20%).
5124 2018-09-30 20:12:41 Holding Facilities have been around alot longer than 8 years! It has esclated in this current administration. Obama, Clinton none helped. As far as nonpartisan, well cattleman & oil barons R now calling the shots & profit on horse flesh is the reason. BLM did sell 2 kill buyers
5125 2018-09-30 20:12:30 Why is your face covered in oil?
5126 2018-09-30 20:12:11 whne will anybody go to JAIL?????

congress can even send you to heaven, but you cant even send any small babu/goon/congressi to jail. 

SHUT UPPPPP!!!!
5127 2018-09-30 20:12:01 Getting my hair twisted with this coconut oil 
5128 2018-09-30 20:11:52 Sjkskehusksjsbah HOW COULD YOU STEAL FROM OIL BIRD HE DOESNT DESERVE SUCH ILL TREATMENT
5129 2018-09-30 20:11:45 Whoever finds out who snipped my oil lines at juanas last night i will give you 1000 dollars cash money .
5130 2018-09-30 20:11:44 Its not just all oil and gass mate;) the whole maritime industry aswell
5131 2018-09-30 20:11:30 @DennisPerkins5 The #SNL oil baron sketch raised the episode a whole grade for me. There was one memorably sharp joke in the frat film, too. When Beck is nude on the diving board, the caption says he denied doing this to a grand jury. And EVERYONE at the party backed him up.
5132 2018-09-30 20:11:29 Erkenntnis dieser #AnNÄHerungSüd  Always check your oil before you leave.
5133 2018-09-30 20:11:18 I support the idea of dealing with them ruthlessly.
5134 2018-09-30 20:11:12 Oh man. The Ukrainian oil exploration loan I'm trying to sell has been such a absolute dickfest. So brutal.
5135 2018-09-30 20:11:08 don‘t need to go to the auto shop to change my oil when i can just call up aizawa
5136 2018-09-30 20:11:04 Indeed, that isn't true. Even pollsters independently paid agreed Putin popularity is strengthening as oil prices hikes again. I wonder how Putin popularity could affect world affairs as Trump mishandling of trade with partners worsen every US denizen struggling every single day.
5137 2018-09-30 20:10:58 my hands are gonna be worse during the winter, especially since i wash the dishes for most of my shifts at work LMAO

last year they were peeling, and i had to rub baby oil before putting lotion on to add extra moisture
5138 2018-09-30 20:10:49 The Connolly Hot Oil Act sounds so much sexier a piece of legislation than it actually was.
5139 2018-09-30 20:10:25 If you have ever thought about trying a CBD oil to help combat anxiety, let us know. We’d love to help you!
5140 2018-09-30 20:10:23 I bet he is wearing cotton grown by some MAGAfolk, eating beef, using oil pumped by those good ol' rednecks who may be wearing MAGA hats.  I am sure everything comes labeled to ensure he can be politically correct and show his wokeness.
5141 2018-09-30 20:10:20 咎さんも猫苦手なのか…
5142 2018-09-30 20:10:19 LOL, Exactly! only a newbie like @lamboJohnny would think otherwise. Cannot wait for the epic fail. For the 2nd time! LOL! Years, and i mean YEARS of court rulings! Oil and Gas in Quebec, just sounds funny! #dumbmoney
5143 2018-09-30 20:10:04 バターとかマーガリンとか知らないけど多分吸ったぜ。
5144 2018-09-30 20:10:03 The cold open was amazing, but I'm pretty sure I'll be quoting the oil baron sketch for the rest of my life. #snl #fuckkanyetho
5145 2018-09-30 20:10:00 Most of Tech still depend on energy from oil to function. 

The point is that oil still remains a very profitable sector and will remain so for the predictable future.
5146 2018-09-30 20:09:35 argon oil thingy
5147 2018-09-30 20:09:26 I guess you prefer the "war for oil establishment " America is famously hated for,  guess you're anti unemployment,  guess you support funding rebels and civil war in foreign nations,  guess you support a proxy war with Russia and Korean civil war...  Wake up
5148 2018-09-30 20:09:12 A hot essential oil bubble bath with a good playlist, a big cup of tea, incense, and a good book is exactly what I need right now 
5149 2018-09-30 20:09:11 My brain is working all the time thinking about this also for oil and gas!
5150 2018-09-30 20:09:03 LEO We'll use Saudi oil rig.
5151 2018-09-30 20:08:39 Please refrain from accessing any and all EMS since most life saving intervention tools are made from oil and gas directly or indirectly.
5152 2018-09-30 20:08:36 I agree. That’s why many easily fall for psuedomedicine and snake oil. 

That’s why we have a process known as the scientific process in medicine to help us differentiate real treatments from fake. And why this same process helps us understand the nature of diseases. 1/2
5153 2018-09-30 20:08:33 Get you some CBD oil
5154 2018-09-30 20:08:07 Ferdinand Ostertag

Oil and plywood
5155 2018-09-30 20:07:39 Incorrect. Those fighting for a pipeline that intends to intensify oil extraction is not thinking of future generations. They are thinking about there own self interests. Their fears supersede the very existence of humanity. That is not logical nor moral.
5156 2018-09-30 20:07:27 Don’t like the taste of #deforestation and #humanrights abuse in your Pepsi? Join me and RT to tell @PepsiCo CEO @IndraNooyi to cut ties with deplorable palm oil business partner @Indofood in her final week as CEO
5157 2018-09-30 20:07:24 Coconut oil >
5158 2018-09-30 20:07:22 I was under the impression that she and her colleagues wanted the probe.
5159 2018-09-30 20:07:11 Idk my mom uses argon oil a lot for silky smooth hair lol. And for skin don’t forget like some wrinkle stuff!! 
5160 2018-09-30 20:07:11 This was the plan all along. They knew ahead of time they've got nothing.
5161 2018-09-30 20:07:11 Just like oil and water don't mix a rapist like Brett Kavanaugh does not mix well with the Supreme Court
5162 2018-09-30 20:07:00 thank you... I've desperately been trying to figure out these thoughts, my therapist suggested cannabis oil for my panic attacks, I worry I can't afford those, so at least I have jobs that will help
5163 2018-09-30 20:06:51 Castor oil baby , every night before u sleep
5164 2018-09-30 20:06:46 Whether It was known or he prophesied it the most important thing is there is oil in Zim honestly I don't understand the rage
5165 2018-09-30 20:06:46 Bloody el Michelle that was fantastic! It's a yes from me too 
5166 2018-09-30 20:06:22 If she’s interested in trying a cbd oil that is non-psychoactive and without THC, we would love to help you! 
5167 2018-09-30 20:06:20 And change the f’ing oil while you’re down there.
5168 2018-09-30 20:06:03 Get the grilled chicken and cheddar witch hot peppers and oil 
5169 2018-09-30 20:05:30 Forget, he’s the richest, forget all those conspiracy theories. Wealth is not grown by magic
Even dictators in oil rich African countries that have stayed 30yrs in office are still not worth $30b
5170 2018-09-30 20:05:16 No brainier. Like asking if you want a spoonful of honey or a spoonful of castor oil!!
5171 2018-09-30 20:05:04 kkkkkk የpropaganda machinaቸው oil አበቀበት መሰል?
5172 2018-09-30 20:04:45 strange thing how when they find oil in your garden it is the country's property but when they find weed it is yours
5173 2018-09-30 20:04:42 You use palm oil.
Not buying.
5174 2018-09-30 20:04:16 Haven't they got women's heads to be cutting off and poncing around with the Human Rights Council!?

Fucking oil clowns need to piss off and look in the mirror before demanding ANYTHING FROM ANYONE ELSE!! 
5175 2018-09-30 20:03:57 Does anyone have an essential oil diffiuser? What oils/oil combos do you recommend?
5176 2018-09-30 20:03:54 Someone threw a bottle of Omega3 pills at me.  Luckily, my injuries were only super fish oil.  ;-)
5177 2018-09-30 20:03:53 "And gold diggers dig until they, find oil"

No offense, but the irony is just too much for me not to.
5178 2018-09-30 20:03:44 should’ve realized the olive oil I bought last night wasn’t actually on sale lmao
5179 2018-09-30 20:03:19 @KathrynAnn04, what essential oil did you rub on milas skin? My dog has very bad itchy skin and looking to help him as much as I can! Thank you  p.s love your videos and wish you were back on YouTube! Especially for vlogmas 
5180 2018-09-30 20:03:18 Justin David Gustafson hosts oil painting classes at LACA each Sunday from1-4 p.m.

5185 2018-09-30 20:02:42 Aren't they cooked in old engine oil?

5186 2018-09-30 20:02:32 My idea of risky business is waiting too long to get an oil change for my car

Alex Cora's idea of risky business is this damn bullpen
5187 2018-09-30 20:02:28 I have some snake oil to sell you.
5188 2018-09-30 20:02:26 People be like “oh the birds!!!” As if oil and gas hasn’t destroyed homes, families, infected areas water supplies, and destroyed the environment already lol
5189 2018-09-30 20:02:24 The price of crude oil has about doubled to $90 a barrel in the past 3  or 4 years
5190 2018-09-30 20:02:13 Because most Texans don't want a wall. Dumb waste of money. Border enforcement is a needed expense, but lots of better ways to do that enforcement.  A wall is BS snake oil talk. Only the gullible buy it and most Texans aren't goobers.
5191 2018-09-30 20:02:13 Hiding in plain sight. Though I'm surprised that, in 42 days, someone buying soda hasn't thought, "Oh , hey, I almost forgot I need cooking oil. Thanks, Walmart."
5192 2018-09-30 20:02:10 My Grand would chase me down everyday with Castor oil. Gives me nightmares. Carters????

5195 2018-09-30 20:01:53 Even the oil companies want cap & trade or a carbon tax, they know it helps reduce the effects of climate change. They base their decision by their own scientist that have studied it. Even with the heatwaves we had this year, how many bad air day alert did they have to issue?
5196 2018-09-30 20:01:52 A name change and the man @kanyewest is selling snake  oil. I mean really, this Artist disagrees w/ yo yo ye.
5197 2018-09-30 20:01:49 @FirestoneAuto just walked in to firestone at 83&indian school rd. Asked if it’s possible to get oil change. Mgr st fromt desk stated b several hrs or bring back tomorrow. Cant brng bak or leave. But was not polite in any way totally rude
5198 2018-09-30 20:01:46 cooking eggs with oil is disgusting <<<<
5199 2018-09-30 20:01:27 Plastic bottle and what kind of oil was it?

Looks sore, do you have any lavender essential oil? Works a treat on burns.
5203 2018-09-30 20:00:56 so i got the ecostyler with the cannabis sativa oil in it ...
5204 2018-09-30 20:00:53 Sinful. So much damage done from A-Z. Air, water, ocean pollution. Animal's being wiped out, rain forest's decimated, oil spills, what a total cock up man has caused. Disgraceful.
5205 2018-09-30 20:00:52 The patient I saw had a HCT of 53, & NADIR levels Total T 849, calculated free T 21.3ng/dL ( 4-15) and bioavailable T 499 ng/dL ( 50-190) !

5208 2018-09-30 20:00:08 Basically nothing there except reauthorizations. Solve water crises like Flint? Nothing.  Build bridges, roads, public transportation? Nothing. Oil and gas? Very few jobs. Many more in renewable energy. Fight climate change? Nothing.
5209 2018-09-30 19:59:52 If you don't have enough time for a full shower shaving session, just smooth baby oil onto your legs before you take the razor to them.
5210 2018-09-30 19:59:45 Q raised from me on government’s response to wide scale deforestation in Borneo for mass production of palm oil. A: sadly not in gov’s priority to curb atm & aim is still for economic development. Justif. was 48% forest still retained with 600k jobs provided.[1/2] @chedetofficial
5211 2018-09-30 19:59:39 I can’t find this oil 
5212 2018-09-30 19:59:34 Actual Landlocked Alberta.
1)Oil discount occurs because we apparently have "Tide Water" access.
2)Internation Law and the NATO group agrees Landlocked nations have "Secured Right to Ocean Access" at cost only.
3)We get all border tide water Provinces and Teritories access.
5213 2018-09-30 19:59:24 Quickly third and seven for #Texans at their 27. Lucas Oil Stadium, once silent, is believing again. #Colts
5214 2018-09-30 19:59:19 Can’t tell if the siren at Lucas Oil is coming from the speakers or is it just @ShowtimeT_95??
5215 2018-09-30 19:58:58 They drained my oil but didn’t replace it! My oil light came on today and I just had it changed earlier this month. My dad check it and it was NOTHING in there. My damn engine could’ve fucked up because they dumbasses ain’t do they job
5216 2018-09-30 19:58:50 Expecting gap up opening without holding ground and testing mid 72 before US openning on #crudeoil #usoil #oil #hampetrol #oott

5218 2018-09-30 19:58:32 I will come and oil and grease it when I come.
5219 2018-09-30 19:58:20 Sounds funky but when my skin is dry I use coconut oil! Also does a great job of taking off mascara!
5220 2018-09-30 19:57:59 @paulwaugh - so with all the crap going on these days and all the lies Mogg spouts the best you can come up with Mr Waugh is how refreshing it is to hear a fluent speaker.  Lord save us - it's snake oil salesmanship and you should be challenging it - it's a disgrace you're not.
5221 2018-09-30 19:57:38 Well maybe the president can also follow New Zealand's lead and ban new offshore oil exploration and join them in #MakeOilHistory to help protect the world from #climatechange but he's a republican so they don't believe in that such a shame to America
5222 2018-09-30 19:57:31 The only good sketch of the night was the oil baron, There Will Be Blood, career day rendition.
5223 2018-09-30 19:57:22 Rather proud of my Mum for divesting from a major oil company to focus on expanding her renewable energy portfolio instead #Divestment #Renewables #ClimateWeekNYC
5224 2018-09-30 19:57:20 I used your lovely rapeseed oil in yesterday’s demo ... brought some home with me too
5225 2018-09-30 19:57:11 Tried that Epsom salt & lavender oil thing & nearly fell asleep in the bath after 15 mins
5226 2018-09-30 19:56:41 how tf you get rid of cooking oil? I know I'm not supposed to just pour it into the soil outside so........
5227 2018-09-30 19:56:34 Fuccck I thought coconut oil was the go to lmao I just bought some instead of this 
5228 2018-09-30 19:56:19 i'm probably gonna do inktober daily for my art class (which is where i got the prompt list) but i wish it was oil pastel-tober instead.
5229 2018-09-30 19:56:11 If I run out of time in the morning, I'll just oil and brush my beard on the 07:15!
5230 2018-09-30 19:56:06 If there is no plastic or palm oil????
5231 2018-09-30 19:55:39 The biggest oil companies will NEVER want an electric car.

5232 2018-09-30 19:55:35 just been informed that goose knocked down the sunflower oil from the top of the fridge, bit into the bottle and spilled it all over the floor :'+(
5233 2018-09-30 19:55:19 Girl I'm obsessed with the royal oil!!
5234 2018-09-30 19:55:06 US is hungry for oil, politics doesn’t stop that. Your claim was that the US gives Venezuela $1billion a month which it doesn’t, according to your link they pay for oil. That’s not giving. Also your link is out of date, Venezuela has stopped accepting US$ cash payments now.
5235 2018-09-30 19:55:03 Open roof Lucas Oil Stadium on a sunny day has to be the most obnoxious place to broadcast a football game.
5236 2018-09-30 19:54:28 He was NOT a fan of the bath either. I just didn’t want him licking the oil off himself
5237 2018-09-30 19:54:28 once i get my car i get a free oil change and a free detail from the dealer 
5238 2018-09-30 19:54:27 Try cbd oil???
5239 2018-09-30 19:54:21 Mate love Roy, but look all the fights he's having with Ireland.  Him and Pogba would be oil and water.  No way would i want him.
5240 2018-09-30 19:54:20 Is about time to see the oil prices shift.
5241 2018-09-30 19:54:15 E chi ci ha mai creduto? D. Rockefeller fondò la Trilaterale proprio per lo sgarro che fecero gli Stati Uniti al nonno...quando smembrarono la Standard Oil perché era diventata troppo potente e rappresentava una minaccia. Secondo me da allora questi hanno avuto un chiodo fisso...
5242 2018-09-30 19:54:05 Someone teach me how to oil paint
5243 2018-09-30 19:53:35 When the roads are so poor for bicycles, they are good for the car industry, they are good for pharmaceutical industry, they are good for the oil industry.  Well, lets get real man. What is the problem? Can we not suck and blow at the same time?
5244 2018-09-30 19:53:22 There is no difference in the “drug” cannabis and the “medicine” cannabis. Smoking cannabis, drinking an oil or eating a brownie all comes from the same plant. The only death from this plant is caused by it being illegal, I.e. gangs and dealers.
5245 2018-09-30 19:53:10 I usually mix the milk, vegetable oil, and eggs together and pour the mixture over the already stirred together flour, salt, sugar, and baking powder and then let it sit a minute before combining.
5246 2018-09-30 19:53:10 This wasn’t meant to imply that they will come close to $30b in sales, that’s just the market opportunity. Why say “for fish oil”, when they just released results demonstrating that their product blows away OTC fish oil and provides a huge CV risk benefit?

This tweet sounds wrong.
5251 2018-09-30 19:52:29 So you go searching out loads of articles all based on one opinion. Fail. I go by empirical evidence. Where has fracking occured. USA. Where has energy got cheaper? Which country is now an exporter rather than importer? Are they more or less likely to start wars over oil?
5252 2018-09-30 19:52:28 I bloody love him! What an absolute beaut! He can be as round as he likes as far as I’m concerned
My ginger boy looked quite round too. We realised a lot of it was fluff when we had to give him a bath after he got covered in car oil. He looked so scrawny with wet fur
5253 2018-09-30 19:52:24 You keep massaging that castor oil on your jawline boo
5254 2018-09-30 19:52:17 But the counter argument for that would be: Wasn't that that for which the Alberta Heritage Savings Trust was for?

As unpopular as it will be, it is perhaps time for the AB govt to consider at least imposing a PST during oil cycle bust times and removing it during boom times.
5255 2018-09-30 19:52:16 Hair serum or oil can help a lot.

5259 2018-09-30 19:51:53 I'd love to learn how to use oil painting... or at least have the time and patience to learn to paint in general, be it digitally or with acrilycs or something like that.

The government you praise so much doesn't allow nuclear plants, a cleaner source of energy than oil, to be constructed anymore.
5265 2018-09-30 19:51:15 why do oil changes take forever

5267 2018-09-30 19:51:00 Well back when it was illegal I could get it at a medical farmers market. But now im sure you can ask around at different 21+ stores for lotion. The one I used was coconut oil based

5272 2018-09-30 19:50:33 My husband went in for an oil change today and they wrecked his car. I asked him what the guy said after he wrecked it. He said the guy said “ooops”

5274 2018-09-30 19:50:01 - reconstruction of local infrastructure would generate big for the US.
- biggest proven oil reserves to be exploited again by US.
- Venezuela would undoubtedly become a most important ally for the US in the region.
- it would be a blow for the Cubans and marxism regionally.

5282 2018-09-30 19:48:36 The you are for solar.  It has cost parity with oil and with battery storage advancements will become cheaper going forward.  AZ’s most valuable resource is the nearly 365 days of sun we get; only someone stupid or has big bucks on the line would not exploit it.
5283 2018-09-30 19:48:30 loved the macho man story by hulk hogan... "no baby oil".....#legend
5284 2018-09-30 19:48:07 I mean to be fair they were at least heavy duty toe nail scissors? Loool.

Oooh yeah and then their hair gets all gummy.  Flashbacks, bad memories.  We have coconut oil and olaplex now, times are better.
5285 2018-09-30 19:48:04 They have debts of $132 bn to US and China they can’t pay. US may buy crude but a debt write off would really save the economy. Plus they refine with expensive oil then sell to Russia/EU. It keeps big oil but not the ppl.
5286 2018-09-30 19:47:55 They‘re economy is heavily based around oil and gas & the government literally owns the major oil & gas company. They use that money to distribute benefits to the population. That’s socialism almost by definition.
5287 2018-09-30 19:47:52 No more pushing me around from now on I'll be dumping my used oil down the sewer drain!

5302 2018-09-30 19:45:55 Little leak from the rocker cover I think, it was like it on cylinders 1-4, doesn’t seem to use any oil so I think it was just a little dribble over time.

5308 2018-09-30 19:45:14 No, cold turkey is impossible. That should be self evident. What I would like to see, is pressure put on industry to innovate rather then continually going after the low hanging fruit of resources. It would serve the whole country well for us to progress, rather then cling to oil

5335 2018-09-30 19:42:00 That sucks Red. It's illegal here, but I don't care. I'm not going to suffer and I'll be damned if I'm going to depend on opioids for relief, plus it helps some of my other medical issues as well. You might try THC free CBD oil. I know a few people that swear by it.
5336 2018-09-30 19:41:52 Imagine how bad the stuff is they are hiding!!!!
Someone needs to propose oil refinery, drilling or some eyesore near Marlago. I know nothing about resource beds. Too bad humans society or other can't take dead fish and animals to place on Marlagos shore & beaches.
5337 2018-09-30 19:41:48 They should tell Turdeau to get lost & refuse to sell oil to Canada. Then maybe, just maybe that dipsh*t Turdeau would get some pipelines built.

5339 2018-09-30 19:41:07 Okay, so, in our day and age coconut oil and apple cider vinegar are the be all/fix all/ ingredient. If you had a say in the next trendy fix it- what would it be?
5340 2018-09-30 19:40:57 I use witch hazel after I wash my face in the morning and at night. It gets off any left behind dirt and oil.

5357 2018-09-30 19:38:00 For years, Finance ministry portfolios were given to lawyers and they have been failing to deliver as they always go by facts rather intuition. BTW Trump, oil prices can never be controlled by any individual Indian. Modi foolishly once said he would equalise value of USD to INR.
5358 2018-09-30 19:37:50 Keep quiet? Not quite. Yesterday a Trump's  official  said that US is ready to impose naval blockade on Russia over oil supplies. My first reaction was that a new top meeting is under preparation.
5359 2018-09-30 19:37:38 Remind me, why is there an EPA again? The only thing they are protecting is big oil.
5360 2018-09-30 19:37:36 The feeling of oil running down your scalp >>
5361 2018-09-30 19:37:31 He could have. 

Nonetheless his meaning is clear.  Canada isn't asserting it's strategic interests by discounting our oil to a monopolistic customer. I agree with him.
5362 2018-09-30 19:37:29 None. Bought them on your recommendation but SO Much oil

5366 2018-09-30 19:36:52 with my new job I come home smelling like toilet cleaner but even that is an upgrade from feeling like I dunked my head in a vat of oil the food industry really has no parallel in sucking
5367 2018-09-30 19:36:47 Why did I read this as old baby oil 
5368 2018-09-30 19:36:37 Even CBD oil? By law, it must contain a very small amt of THC, the psychoactive property in cannabis. Most CBD oil is derived from hemp & hemp naturally has very low THC. Unfortunately, many states are still unclear on whether or not CBD oil is legal.
5369 2018-09-30 19:36:20 @elonmusk and ‘his’ @Tesla has triggered an avalanche which would set free many economies from oil trade, end of oil cartels, end of war for oil and more. Evidence is how all leading car makers are jumping on to the electric car bandwagon. @elonmusk is not in the pockets of SEC.

5372 2018-09-30 19:35:37 The oil vid is one of her best. You have alot of catching up to do!
5373 2018-09-30 19:35:31 Could be a great success. Oil has been produced from one of the largest oilfields in Europe beneath Poole Harbour for decades. Safely and with no damage to the environment. Most people were not even aware it was there until told!
5374 2018-09-30 19:35:26 "Its not about how tired you are, its about how tired you're making everyone else.."

*me explaining bed time to my kids*
5375 2018-09-30 19:35:25 I used 1/2 cup granulated sugar + 2-3 tbsp raw sugar + some oatmeal and oat milk, 2 tbsp coconut oil and a little olive oil (I thought I had more so I had to mix them) and then I added a little sprinkle of ginger and about 1/4 cup German hot chocolate mix.
5376 2018-09-30 19:35:17 And when moms comes in with the oil and the Bible let her know this was your doing ?
5377 2018-09-30 19:34:52 You are obviously strong in your opinion, and I hope leading by example through a personal divestiture of oil and related products. This is the case, correct?
5378 2018-09-30 19:34:48 Today I bought body butter, raw coconut oil, a coconut oil blend (it stays liquid), & a argan shea body scrub.....smh
5379 2018-09-30 19:34:16 My formula for success? Rise early, work late, strike oil.

5380 2018-09-30 19:34:08 I’ve been lagging to fix my rotors, break pads and change my oil. Today is finally the day I’m not lazy enough to change them 
5381 2018-09-30 19:34:07 Put a small amount of toothpaste on your tooth brush and gently brush your lips in a circular motion with warm water.. Do this until most of the dead skin is off. Then apply EOS chapstick, or Vaseline. If it’s really bad you can use Olive oil for a few days. Apply with a Qtip.
5382 2018-09-30 19:34:04 The deaths were caused by the fact that the west wanted control of Iraqi oil and to open up more markets. You have no idea what Iraq was really about.

"Lets see...After coming back from the mall, I used the jasmine oil that I bought for a good smell...."
5384 2018-09-30 19:33:59 Took my car to get an oil change and now they done found 76 other problems. Let me call my daddy 
5385 2018-09-30 19:33:50 Are you aware on Ambode's press conference today? Please search it online? He hung himself...Like someone who was about to be roasted, and aided the process by rubbing palm oil all over his body.
5386 2018-09-30 19:33:48 Ah jaysis I'm six hours late to this tweet! I hope you had a nice roast! Recipe is chop into florets, throw in a bag with crushed garlic and a splash of oil. Roast in the oven for 10-15 mins and then grate over Parmesan and season 
5387 2018-09-30 19:33:41 Your liberals will never meet the Paris targets either because you are both puppets to big oil.

1. You have what you say you have
2. Nobody doubts what you have
3. You never have to use it

If you are using it, you are losing it.

5402 2018-09-30 19:31:11 The sentiment matters, I heartily agree. But the particular statement of "I want oil to be worthless" is out of touch with reality.
5403 2018-09-30 19:31:06 Sharon, if you ever need/want some help from someone whom has 25 years experience in production of oil n gas and can show you the details and hidden facts, call me.

5409 2018-09-30 19:30:39 but if you tryna just fry it, it's the same process of oil in the pan but then just crack the egg directly in the hot pan and season it there. then once the egg white becomes white, you can flip it or just leave it as is.

5414 2018-09-30 19:29:57 DANG, this thing, I guess woman needs 2 sit down & have her morning grits, maybe a walk N the Apple Orchard, maybe a dose of Caster Oil will calm her, maybe a new man or woman of her dreams might be needed, whatever it is, I hope it comes soon, otherwise she'll lose her britches.
5415 2018-09-30 19:29:56 You may also be interested to know, that even today, if you travel to Alaska and dig down on the beaches, there is oil a few inches down. It devastated the local economy and resulted in the deaths of countless marine animals. To suggest that the devastation is worth it, is crazy.
5416 2018-09-30 19:29:26 Wow she reallg just said fuck it and tea tree oil all on her face
5417 2018-09-30 19:29:25 Everyone ain’t built for this oil field stuff
5418 2018-09-30 19:29:17 @cafreeland Don’t buckle to Navarro, no one likes him especially the Chinese, and put the $30 tax on oil shipments to the US as our producers are not getting a fair price for our oil resources!  That’s $105 Million a day.
5419 2018-09-30 19:28:22 start by putting a bit of oil in a pan and put it over a med-high heat. prep your eggs how you want (scrambled is just the easiest), let the ancestors guide your hands in how much seasoning you put in, and (this step is totes optional) add a splash of milk.
5420 2018-09-30 19:28:07 When we moved back to Phx after 16 years in rural NC, we couldn't even get a neighbor to wave. Very different.
5421 2018-09-30 19:28:01 Ughhhh PLEASE NO. I’ve considered peppermint oil, but it can give cats pneumonia and mine keep sniffing the cabinet that the mice are hanging in so I can’t do that. Thanks for the advice though!!
5422 2018-09-30 19:27:54 Ooooooh hands & feet at same time just a little baby oil 4 out with the bags & the jobs a good yin Pamela 
5423 2018-09-30 19:27:48 Please comment on potential for oil to be valued in other than USD and the impact it would have.
5424 2018-09-30 19:27:36 Now I can’t stop thinking about the shrinking south and how it’s like the valley in LA, which no one wants to say they live in, so it just gets pushed further back every year. 

Eventually the south will just be Mitch McConnell on an oil platform in the gulf.
5425 2018-09-30 19:27:31 It's terrific in quiche, too, dear.
Make my own salad dressings & I use soy sauce in the dressing with stuff like snow peas and snap peas in a salad. Soy goes well with sesame oil, too.
A little soy & a little sesame oil on white rice....toasted sesame seeds.
I buy stuff in bulk.
5426 2018-09-30 19:27:29 Thank god is rite! Some suggestions you may wanna try for stomach irritation if ur interested is cooking with pine nut oil, broccoli helps, garlic supplements and green tea with Manuka honey. Not sure if you can have those things but I heard they help quite a lot
5427 2018-09-30 19:27:13 Ever heard of an electric 747? We need liquid fuels & this works. It's also a potential source of plastic which is an oil byproduct.

5433 2018-09-30 19:26:32 Can this affect oil prices?
5434 2018-09-30 19:26:01 OIL HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH PROFIT, *MARM*
5435 2018-09-30 19:25:52 lol -- I'm old enough to remember rubbing linament oil on my legs for winter footy matches ------ if it touched your bollocks 
5436 2018-09-30 19:25:51 Try evening primrose oil and spicy foods (says the woman with no chillun). Dem say secks too 
5437 2018-09-30 19:25:49 It must do, and it's shocking that the one you went to Nicky didn't have a sign up. My local one has a huge sign advertising that they use 100% peanut oil. This is such a sad story

5440 2018-09-30 19:25:26 I recall one of those DNC emails where Neera Tanden suggested taking oil from Libya after the NATO removal of Gaddafi as a way of funding social programs like Head Start. It was....not dissimilar to Trump's "take the oil" rhetoric.
5441 2018-09-30 19:25:26 I'm an athlete ... I need to keep fit
5442 2018-09-30 19:25:19 But no change in twelve years now.  If it all melts the Rusduans can rescue the oil and gas that's down there.
5443 2018-09-30 19:25:14 I have an obsession with olive oil
5444 2018-09-30 19:25:10 Had KFC than dipped his hands in motor oil B4 kickoff
5445 2018-09-30 19:25:05 ‘We will be erased without the Redskins!’ Ya, people sure forgot all about bullets when they became the Wizards and don’t get me started with how we don’t even have Oil in our lives anymore.  #gah
5446 2018-09-30 19:25:01 These tire places be trying it!! Dude tried to charge me $93 for a damn oil change.  Talking about it’s the DELUXE! Deluxe my ass, I can change my own damn oil; but just don’t want too.
5447 2018-09-30 19:25:00 Both countries are oil producing state. 

Thanks to Qatar anyways.

5449 2018-09-30 19:24:47 My CBD oil post is a hit lol Chronik Fusions should sponsor me
5450 2018-09-30 19:24:38 I can just imagine-
“I need these filed under O, as in Oil Shale.”
5451 2018-09-30 19:24:28 an oil change and tires is a couple hundred just by itself
5452 2018-09-30 19:24:10 What are you jogging for? 
5453 2018-09-30 19:23:59 The harvesting of aquatic thermal vents, combined with wind and solar efforts, could offset the need to extract oil from under the oceans.
5454 2018-09-30 19:23:49 Oil production has decreased ‘ the quality has dropped. If Venezuela is a mega rich country getting huge payments from US imports why are they in a state? The country is out of control by bad management by a socialist dictator.

5460 2018-09-30 19:23:12 Have you tried CBD oil? It can be purchased directly across from Sainsbury's entrance, on a little stall. Read up on it beforehand, give it a try for a few weeks! I use it myself for severe rheumatoid arthritis and it does help.
5461 2018-09-30 19:23:07 Mine is yam and palm oil
5462 2018-09-30 19:23:03 Tossed in olive oil and slow roasted
5463 2018-09-30 19:22:48 Excellent combo - the olive oil helps you absorb more of the tumeric, as does the black pepper.
5464 2018-09-30 19:22:46 I watched one of those debunk the myths shows once and they said none of these tricks work but I boil eggs regularly and I still swear by pouring a tiny bit of olive oil in the water because I think it makes the peeling easier once the eggs are cooled in the fridge. 
5465 2018-09-30 19:22:44 Meaning Eustice will insist imports all produced to UK standards? Dream on, Eustice is selling snake oil
5466 2018-09-30 19:22:11 Peppermint oil supposedly works but I haven't tried it
5467 2018-09-30 19:22:03 scam
5468 2018-09-30 19:21:50 Oil extraction from under the ocean floor, should be stopped until it has been proven that such extractions do not increase the thermal transfer rates or volume from the planet surface into the waters.
5469 2018-09-30 19:21:50 Wars aren’t fought over wanting someone dead tho, they’re fought over resources (like how we’ve gotten centralized opium from Afghanistan and pursued oil deals trough other foreign intervention in the region).
5470 2018-09-30 19:21:38 New quarter. Last quarter was the worst I've had since 2015.

Upbeat though. Oil is strong.

I can stay solvent longer than the market can stay irrational.

I'm looking to add mid cap stock until New Year. Enough AIM for a bit. 0.5% for a tight spread & volume seems fair enough.

5475 2018-09-30 19:20:41 Did Amazon change the muzak at Whole Foods? Pre-acquisition, I distinctly recall Wilco. Now it’s Toto’s Rosanna on perpetual loop. Could this explain why I’m lost in the Cod Liver Oil aisle?
5476 2018-09-30 19:20:25 Check these facts out - Crude oil dominates U.S. imports from Venezuela, which is one of the top five suppliers of foreign oil to the United States.

5479 2018-09-30 19:20:08 Workouts are best varied . One day full on the next chill and stretch plenty dont make every work out painful. If you find a sport you like it can help.
5480 2018-09-30 19:19:56 It’s a keloid girl  it happens cause there’s too much movement between your skin and the ring, that’s why I never switch my stud out anymore. Use tea tree oil! It should help it go down 
5481 2018-09-30 19:19:49 I don't wish to be rude - and I'm no oil painting myself - but yes, you most certainly can tell a lot of the time.  Its not just clothes, hairstyle and make up, its the way someone walks, talks, acts, just everything.  You just can.
5482 2018-09-30 19:19:29 Ha, not at all. I know a bit about Venezuela through associates. I can’t be exact on figures hence I check . Fact is Maduro can’t manage his country besides being an oil rich state.
5483 2018-09-30 19:19:19 Can't wait for the time that they will find alternative to oil.

5489 2018-09-30 19:18:33 Venezuela also has 2nd largest proven oil reserves that it won't allow US pillage of.
5490 2018-09-30 19:18:32 I put Egyptian Goddess oil on my bosum everyday. Does that mean I have Nefirtitties?
5491 2018-09-30 19:18:21 Oil and gas company say it will cost Colorado millions if it passes. That’s because they’re going to sue Coloradans if it passes. They don’t give a damn about your family or mine. Vote yes.
5492 2018-09-30 19:18:20 Crude oil dominates U.S. imports from Venezuela, which is one of the top five suppliers of foreign oil to the United States.

Ooo ooo ooo
5493 2018-09-30 19:18:13 Iran inviting India to invest in Chahbahar, doesn’t serve their mercenary interests? How does a Saudi oil refinery in Gwadar catering to China encircle Iran? Can we think here please, and not succumb to knee jerk responses?
5494 2018-09-30 19:17:47 Facts are Facts! Wages are not rising, prices are rising. Now we will have to deal with the higher oil prices trying to stay warm this winter on top of the higher prices for everything. Companies are closing. The GOP is the party it's ok if you are a sexual abuser.
5495 2018-09-30 19:16:58 There’s something to be said for having a strong person oil you up and steamroll your calves and thighs.
5496 2018-09-30 19:16:51 Try a church. When they open a new church they bless the alter with oil. See if a new church is opening.

Some of the people in the gym are so fit. This man next to me was sprinting for ages on the running machine...I was plodding along..but I will speed up.
5504 2018-09-30 19:15:42 If 10% of new mexico were covered in solar panels, it would power america. Thats not the exact way to go but it proves my point. I would rather farm under a windmill than on top of an underground oil pipeline!
5505 2018-09-30 19:15:27 What were you expecting the FBI to burn the midnight oil? It's all about optics. The GOP is trying to save face now. They still want their way. They'll still vote Kavanaugh in. How is kinda narrowing for them but they can't allow themselves to believe in failure.

5508 2018-09-30 19:14:44 Check the vitamins you’re using. Some of them could have a lot of biotin in them and will over produce oil in your face.

5519 2018-09-30 19:13:23 The US created terrorism in Iraq, Why are you being such a hypocrite? Is it because india is a puppet of the US? The US told India to stop buying Russian Military items and India stopped , and now the US is telling india to stop buying iranian oil which most likely they will do
5520 2018-09-30 19:13:11 Today the oil pocket that was first drilled in 1859 is still producing oil.. Yea it's not a lot because they totally drained the pocket but the planet is still forming it slowly and it's slowly refilling the pocket, or it would if the stopped pumping for a couple millennia...
5521 2018-09-30 19:13:10 I'm confused. Am I to cook with extra virgin olive oil. I thought it burnt at a lower temp? Been using standard olive oil for cooking.
5522 2018-09-30 19:13:04 Both memang kita pakai! Best but after aloe vera tu kita pakai moisturiser. Cetaphil tu AM routine je sbb dia tak remove oil residue sngt

5525 2018-09-30 19:12:52 @RitzCrackers is one of the brands that are still buying dirty palm oil from rainforest destroyers! The first step to stop deforestation is to stop working with companies like Wilmar. #DropDirtyPalmOi
5526 2018-09-30 19:12:46 I didn’t even ask for bread!
And olive oil and balsamic n that. 
5527 2018-09-30 19:12:41 finally replaced the oil in my fryer so things finally taste like anything other than burnt okra
5528 2018-09-30 19:12:37 I can't help but feel that Guyana is going to F up this whole oil and gas thing.
5529 2018-09-30 19:12:33 2. Tinubu was a subject of conceptual acrimony back in those days, but in the milieu of this, he never rubbished the Civil Servants. He said and I quote; "Lagos State civil service is the oil that lubricates the entire State, therefore it's the best, by any degree of estimation"
5530 2018-09-30 19:12:30 Probably built off site and toed into position like a oil rig. Not the level of permanent of the current lighthouse anyway.
5531 2018-09-30 19:12:28 Oil will still be used whether it's produced locally or not. Oil companies are also NOT SUBSIDISED! A tax break is not a subsidy for your information. A subsidy would be a company that receives state funding. There's one area of energy production that is subsidised: RENEWABLES!
5532 2018-09-30 19:12:24 Translation:
IF you are going to use someting to cook, go for olive or avoacod oil
Instead of oils eat the real foods 
IF you are going to eat dairy, but go crazy with butter, eat cheese and whey 
Fine? you want to bake and need butter, use butter.
Othewise eat real food.

5547 2018-09-30 19:10:33 I believe there is a footage where Zangane-Energy/oil minister-spills out that number and then he says only a couple billion made to Iran & the rest no one knows where is it. If I find his interview which was aired on state media, I will send it over to you.
5548 2018-09-30 19:10:25 yes..he said I will struggle for two days...back Thursday though.
So what was your training today ?
5549 2018-09-30 19:10:25 "eat real food" translates into less butter and more olive oil?  Less cheese and more they?  Afraid I don't understand.

5551 2018-09-30 19:10:14 Oil becoming worthless?? Not going to happen anytime soon.

Aside from it being in heavy use by the maritime and airline industries, it's used to make plastics. (Also used in microbeads found in facial washes produced by some in the cosmetics industry.)

5553 2018-09-30 19:09:59 Oil 101 was surprisingly good for the oil industry. It was designed to be the textbook for oil that every industry should have. As if industries were also college classes.

5555 2018-09-30 19:09:41 I was putting some oil in my head but I squeezed to hard. The cap don popped off and now there’s  a whole bottle of oil dripping down my back..... great

5557 2018-09-30 19:09:10 By the way, this is the smallest Colts crowd ever at Lucas Oil Stadium. Announced crowd is 57,716. That's just 86.1 percent of capacity. Can you blame anybody?
5558 2018-09-30 19:08:51 Great results. Gonna try frying my eggs in coconut oil from today.
5559 2018-09-30 19:08:49 I wonder if @L8ShowColbert knows what an unthinking, mean-spirited tool he has become? I'm ashamed I ever liked him.

So classic. Such vintage.
5565 2018-09-30 19:08:24 US wants to block #Russia energy exports. Why?

"We can do that because the United States is the largest producer of #oil and #gas" - Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke

Hubris is the downfall. Energy makes up over a quarter of Russian exports. President Trump is overplaying his hand.

5568 2018-09-30 19:08:15 Hes hurt them badly on steel and aluminum, also trying to hurt them on energy but the EU is all aboit getting oil and has from russia, therefore theyre mad at us for calling them out

5579 2018-09-30 19:06:45 Thank God for the USA! Making sure that poor people's natural resources go to the right hands - the hands of the wealthy! Why should Brazilians profit from the cocoa they grow when Nestlé make so much money from it? Or Congo from their Coltan, or Nigerians from their oil etc etc.
5580 2018-09-30 19:06:20 Gut wrenching that because of this idiot these frauds get to add ‘as seen in forbes’ to marketing their snake oil
5581 2018-09-30 19:06:17 I hate the Fast & Furious films. They're supposed to be car obsessed, yet never mention cars. Do you ever see any of them covered in oil? Ponces.
5582 2018-09-30 19:06:03 then the one where you sit and have to push your legs open and shut..36 of those...then he swopped me to another piece of equipment...36 going the other way. Oh god it hurt ...it makes the upper leg muscles strong. was very funny. 
He was a nice man though.

5590 2018-09-30 19:04:44 We are so lucky. We go to a tiny village in Southern Crete and an  elderly man gives us his own olive oil, which he fills up in old water bottles. There's nothing like it 
5591 2018-09-30 19:04:39 THEY want men to be watered down lackeys. If men are removed from society,game over. Sorry ladies,but true. Look at construction sites,sewage treatment, oil rigs,stockyards,etc. One CAN find women in these fields but not enough to keep the world going. Few could lift 100lb allday
5592 2018-09-30 19:04:32 It’s VERY SAD when I see a breast cancer patient come back six months after diagnosis, thinking their tumor shrunk but it hasn’t, it’s just retracted the skin and by now there’s more cancerous masses she can’t feel. Makes me so angry at the snake oil salespersons!

5597 2018-09-30 19:03:48 Yes, we went inside & saw the man making peanut oil. You can climb up to the balcony to see the lay of the land better.  I think we signed up at the IAmsterdam store, the same place you show your voucher & pick up your City Pass.

5601 2018-09-30 19:03:29 It's not difficult. I made my first forge with a weed burner and soft fire bricks. Worked with some easy steels like 5160, 80CRV2, and O1, got some fast quench oil and did some 1075 and 1095, and now have moved on to stainless.

5636 2018-09-30 18:58:27 ...Notley for listening to the advice of industry heads and allowing what THEY started to remain intact? Not a fucking chance. In fact, it also proves Notley is not out to “destroy” our oil patch, she’s been working with them and now even getting shit for that. KENNEY LIES! 2/2
5637 2018-09-30 18:58:18 I’m going to the gym in my oil hair treatment that way I can just wash my hair when I get home , people gonna think I got greasy ass hair smh
5638 2018-09-30 18:58:10 Dash of olive oil too if you are using bbq, on the plancha oil it first.
5639 2018-09-30 18:58:09 Your screens are gonna turn off, sudden accelerations, autonomous driving turned off, doors will open by them selves every 5.25 minutes, it's gonna have a gasoline engine, you will blow a head gasket, your oil will spill, and probably more things.
5640 2018-09-30 18:58:06 only if you use oil
5641 2018-09-30 18:58:05 Grate it, add salt, lime juice, a little sesame oil.
5642 2018-09-30 18:58:01 Hope you use oil from Dabur — Tel laga ke dabur ka ... naam mita do babur ka
5643 2018-09-30 18:57:57 Try some sort of shampoo and oil for the hair on your head ONLY. Pills and gummies grow EVERY hair on your body and fast too. Much easier to just go with a hair product like shampoo or something
5644 2018-09-30 18:57:43 I did very well and it was hard. I had a trainer keep check on me. The leg press and another one were the hardest. I told the man I felt like I was going to give birth ..it was ever so funny. Twice a week and I will gradually be challenged.
5645 2018-09-30 18:57:15 thanks to @GasBuddyDan for the look-ahead at fuel prices come Nov 6 when U.S. embargo on Iran kicks in and Canada's oil/gas prices kick up. Pipelines, anyone?

5647 2018-09-30 18:56:51 Songs about me: #Eagles Desperado. And @LZZYHALE @Halestorm #Vicious. Health problems in my 30's? T-bone accident w/an oil tanker? What doesn't kill me makes me VICIOUS. You hearing this @KimberlyAggio ? Thanks Lzzy. Great show @MoheganSun . Lived to see it. Ain't done yet.
5648 2018-09-30 18:56:40 I think u will see a nice  long oil run once Iran is off the grid
5649 2018-09-30 18:56:24 I agree with you. Just excellent CVs but the current Governor was a top guy in National Oil. Professional expertise can be overated till you are certain.
5650 2018-09-30 18:56:05 @Ritzcrackers  Every 25 seconds a football pitch of forest is lost in Indonesia  - and Indigenous People, orangutans and the climate are losing out. A  lot of this is because huge areas of forest are cleared to plant the  palm trees that produce palm oil. DROP WILMAR
5651 2018-09-30 18:55:58 効率的なOil蒸留の流れ
1.Oilを5段型の蒸留塔にかける

5652 2018-09-30 18:55:58 add tea tree oil but not too much
5653 2018-09-30 18:55:40 10/10 would not recommend walking up the stairs at Lucas Oil Stadium at 9 months pregnant
5654 2018-09-30 18:55:39 Their oil fields are drying up.
5655 2018-09-30 18:55:29 I think finger coils is how I wanna start.  What type of oil do you use?
5656 2018-09-30 18:55:28 I think if we refine our oil products we shall create jobs for the youth and grow our economy. But the government is neglecting us. So sad
5657 2018-09-30 18:55:22 Same. Like I said, they’d exhaust all internal options before going after someone in market via trade.
5658 2018-09-30 18:55:21 But what about the Sunnah Olive oil???
5659 2018-09-30 18:55:18 I was at a potluck today and I bit into a sandwich and it had mayo and then I had to spit it out because I remembered that "mayo with avocado oil" is a thing now and I guess I don't do potlucks anymore. Boo.
5660 2018-09-30 18:55:00 get in their pal get those oil rigs working 
5661 2018-09-30 18:54:37 I’ve also noticed that fat content from vegetable oil tends to do better than butter.
5662 2018-09-30 18:54:36 Until the product on the field improves, this is what Lucas Oil will look like. Games are expensive, and fans wont spend the money to be bored and pissed off.
5663 2018-09-30 18:54:34 Some Oil down would be perfect right about now
5664 2018-09-30 18:54:23 Womanda... the country that can't change its oil or open a jar.
5665 2018-09-30 18:54:21 Great stuff !! Sunday workouts commitment there young Jedi. I was also training today.
.
5666 2018-09-30 18:54:11 They be covered in oil girls really like that shit and them niggas don’t speak a lick of English
5667 2018-09-30 18:54:02 Yeah now that you mention it I remember in middle school they talked about natural resources and that oil would eventually run out ....
5668 2018-09-30 18:53:54 You know what gets old? Short sellers misleading in social media and media in general - Good stories turned negative, etc.  Literally betting against the one man with the balls to stand up to the whole oil/auto industry and the physics background to do it
5669 2018-09-30 18:53:49 They must think we're daft! It's bad enough on here getting Twitter follows from 'single widowed with daughter, kind heart, decent bloke' and sometimes a Military shot in background or an Oil Rig.....
5670 2018-09-30 18:53:47 y’all really out her with no eyebrows or edges...  castor oil sis, tired of seeing the foolishness
5671 2018-09-30 18:53:41 กูว่าหุบปากเหอะว่ะ
5672 2018-09-30 18:53:41 I just made the best sandwich of my life:

Bison steak cut into strips with carmelized onions cooked with garlic in oil, apple cider vinegar, and honey. Served on Italian bread from the west side market with garlic aioli and blue cheese. My friends mac n cheese on the side.
5673 2018-09-30 18:53:39 Then again, there probably would’ve been no American blood spilled by middle-East actors were it not for oil; and America wouldn’t have killed hundreds of thousands & incurred probably 100,000 dead & wounded over oil. The benefits of replacing fossil fuels are enormous.
5674 2018-09-30 18:53:23 Sim sim, e lembre se hidratar a pele! É muito importante mantê-la hidratada, se tu não tiver nenhum creme que seja oil free vc pode usar soro fisiológico
5675 2018-09-30 18:53:22 @VCscanner there is an oil well fire just south of Santa Paula ... not sure how serious
5676 2018-09-30 18:53:21 Gentlemen. You appears to be a highly educated man. You should know which mechanisms decide oil price. It is needless to say that you know everything. Ha....Ha.......
5677 2018-09-30 18:53:21 Yeah, just some of the marinade which is oil based. A medium to high heat. Difficult to give you a time, will depend on whether chicken is fridge cold or room temp when you start and how big. But always cut into thickest part and check if you're unsure.
5678 2018-09-30 18:53:05 Tu m’aimes trop c’est pour ça 
5679 2018-09-30 18:52:52 Finger coils is how I started mine. I moisturize with oil and water and try to leave them as much as possible so they don’t thin
5680 2018-09-30 18:52:44 I could use a back massage oil and everything
5681 2018-09-30 18:52:39 May God help us ooooooooo. One advice for the guys, Buy anointing oil and pray on it.  Rub it on your private before stepping out of the house.
5682 2018-09-30 18:52:36 ( I went to the gym )
5683 2018-09-30 18:52:15 NB: Yam and palm oil isn't allowed here.
5684 2018-09-30 18:52:09 Abit of skin oil does the trick....off you're nose 
5685 2018-09-30 18:52:02 Winds of hatred going on now a days which started from cheap politicians and dear sir you are contributing ( oil on fire ) also.
5686 2018-09-30 18:51:57 Naaaa I’ve been careful with the oil hahahah
5687 2018-09-30 18:51:51 When I’ve tidied the flat extensively I never end up finding my go-to things. So I’m trying out A’kin’s organic rosehip oil on my face tonight. Will report back if out magic happens.
5688 2018-09-30 18:51:45 Oilの蒸留過程がめっちゃめんどくさいんだよね
これだけで小さい工場一つ作れるレベルだと思う
5689 2018-09-30 18:51:39 
5690 2018-09-30 18:51:32 This government has technocrats who are worse than the mafia. Any sensible person could just come up with a method of using the crude oil to offset our oil import bill. We need to know where the crude is going. Over to Auditor General.
5691 2018-09-30 18:51:17 Just burnt my whole arm putting potato's in hot oil omfggg
5692 2018-09-30 18:51:07 Fluorite body oil infused with sweet pea, amethyst, and overwhelmed feelings for inner growth and sexual compatibility.
5693 2018-09-30 18:51:02 Gosto que no artigo o autor chama tudo de nome fantasia, posto "Oil" e  o escambau, mas lá no meio solta um "Ipiranga" HAHAHAHHAAH
5694 2018-09-30 18:50:52 Creepy leftwing activist accounts: if I note you following me I will report you for harassment. So, get off my TL right now. If you do not I will contact the local authorities. Not Strzok &Olive Oil Page but my local sheriff. You don’t want to meet him. Trust me.
5695 2018-09-30 18:50:44 My mom hinted at wanting to try CBD oil for her arthritis but she “doesn’t want to be high” even though she’s been taking hydrocodone for it for a decade 
5696 2018-09-30 18:50:43 Oil price drop is over though. Everywhere but Canada, land of confused public policy leaders.
5697 2018-09-30 18:50:39 tea tree oil is just amazing.

George Ezra? Brill
5701 2018-09-30 18:50:02 Because we have regulated it that way.  If we did not have oil, we could not make solar panels or wind turbines, thus they simply are not sustainable.
5702 2018-09-30 18:49:44 Biafra existed and was created by God, positioned them in their own land of inheritance, how did the evil beast British government came to thwart and kill the indigenous people of Biafrans for oil wealth, Theresa and Obama allow us to be free, referendum now
5703 2018-09-30 18:49:43 Gold diggers dig until they find oil
5704 2018-09-30 18:49:35 @JimSterling Did not know you were moonlighting as a Robin Hood, especially taking from the snake oil salesman himself lol
5705 2018-09-30 18:49:34 Peak oil....hahaha Hahahahaha very good...Earth makes oil. Ok humans are burning it faster than it can renew but ...was going to end in 1978
5706 2018-09-30 18:49:28 I do - and yes, he did.  Liberals and economics is like oil and water - doesn’t mix.  His ideas lead to people out of workforce and on government dependence - that is all shifting away from that now
5707 2018-09-30 18:49:13 Who would be interested in coming to a Young Living Essential Oil class in Waynesboro or Collinwood to learn more about the oils?
5708 2018-09-30 18:49:10 Washed & deep conditioned my hair, exfoliated & shaved my legs, moisturized & let coconut oil do its thing. Someone come rub my smooth legs.
5709 2018-09-30 18:49:06 石油だってオリーブオイルだって牛脂だって仲間さ、そうだろう?
5710 2018-09-30 18:48:58 Tremendous step forwards in Oil forward depth cost Aberg the role.  Simple as that.  All positive.  Positive showings by Chia/Brod.  Jesse/Yam/Rat.  Cag stepping up after being ill.  Kass's PK, though he is on edge himself. Even McL & Benson on the way.
5711 2018-09-30 18:48:54 @Bebbrell Hey, for the new Nando’s chicken recipe, how long did you fry the chicken for, what sort of heat, and did you just use a little bit of oil and the marinade to cook it in? Just want to make sure it’s properly cooked when I do it.

5713 2018-09-30 18:48:15 I think it's all every bit about Israel and Hamas.  I am glad America is no longer dependant on foreign oil.
5714 2018-09-30 18:48:14 lots and lots of baby oil?
5715 2018-09-30 18:48:10 How much did @RepJasonLewis get from the oil and fossil fuel industry? Is that why he denies science?
5716 2018-09-30 18:48:09 Electrification is good for both homes and cars. Single points of control for emissions and reduction of leaks. Just look at a parking lot with all the oil drips that get washed into our waterways poisoning them with toxic, carcinogenic chemicals.
5717 2018-09-30 18:48:07 I was trying to figure out why Mr. Bubby Lubby (aka Romeo) was being crabby to his tiny sister?!? I forgot to give them CBD oil yesterday!  
Don’t miss a dose!
5718 2018-09-30 18:47:52 The total value of intellectual properties generated by the people of this country: authors, music, movies, craftsmen, developers, inventors, artist, literary prowess, etc is far beyond the total asset value we have in our oil industry, if only it can be organized and protected.
5719 2018-09-30 18:47:41 Their blue wave is a puddle of water with some leaked motor oil in it that shines all the colors of the rainbow (including that liberal shade of blue)when you look at it in the sunlight.

The wonderful "Flexseed oil" is the top remedy for Osteo's.This is available in North America, Europe,Asia , Australia in soft gel capsules.I prescribed this in Osteo's patients.

5722 2018-09-30 18:47:26 It's so stupid how ESPN and the media try to make it seem like they've lost any oil on their motors ridiculous
5723 2018-09-30 18:47:00 By her will? That’s so unbelievable as that you can roast the oil. It was the plan from the beginning. The “Feinstein Gambit” couldn’t exists without that move. Feinstein gave the order and all the infamy will stay with her ‘till the end of the days. God have mercy of her soul!
5724 2018-09-30 18:46:53 Rico I love crunchy cucumber and tomato salad, drizzled with olive oil, sprinkled with salt and black pepper with my fried egg!
5725 2018-09-30 18:46:50 Tins of Spam will be bigger than the oil and gold markets combined within a year.
5726 2018-09-30 18:46:44 Thank you, Jeff. The responses to your tweet shows the hypocrisy and depravity of liberals.
5727 2018-09-30 18:46:42 Well, I’ve been eating a lot this week... like up to 4 a day and just had 2 this morning haha  think I’m done for today. My stomach must be sensitive to the oil in it or something  such a shame because they’re so yummy! 
5728 2018-09-30 18:46:29 I like this bachelor pad feeling. Mom come back!! I don't know how much oil I should put to make soyrizo!! Ama!!!!

5734 2018-09-30 18:46:00 Google search single suppliers and farming cooperatives for extra virgin olive oil. Small scale suppliers could not survive accusations of corrupted and or low grade produce as big companies can so its far more poky you'll get decent evoo.

5736 2018-09-30 18:45:40 I keep a spray bottle filled with water, lavender oil and eucalyptus oil, and spray it throughout my bathroom and bedroom area. I soak in a bath of epsom salts with a drop of same two oils, and listen to the quiet of the day.
I’m out, wrapped in a towel and eventually doze off.

5753 2018-09-30 18:42:23 price in California for gasoline is higher. We have more gas tax plus the federal government tax and oil companies charge California more for gasoline then any other state. LA has more cars than the rest of states west of the Mississippi. We’re charged for oil companies profit

2. SCOTUS doesn’t try POTUS in an impeachment scenario.

3. 1 and 2 undercut your argument.

If you’re reading sources that say otherwise, it’s snake oil.

5809 2018-09-30 18:36:17 The real question- how many politicians did you pay off to keep solar panels at such a high cost, if it does not use oil make the price extreme. The planet is dying from fossil fuel. ( OIL IS KILLING  EARTH ) Sun light is free.

5915 2018-09-30 18:24:22 Oil hurt us but the single biggest threat is Trumps Tax changes.  The International Corporate Taxation rules bleed Canada of Investment.  Trudeau and Morneau are unwilling to change because they are internationals.

like at its core its egg, oil, and lemon  juice which are all things youd put in a cake
5918 2018-09-30 18:24:00 My wife has become slightly addicted to it. I've been experimenting with a garlic rub before it goes in the oven...loads of salt/pepper/oil too. Thyme today (not done before). Lush!

5921 2018-09-30 18:23:54 What the world doesn't realise that United States has more oil then Saudi Arabia and Venezuela combined. There is vast amount of oil stored underground size of Florida state
5922 2018-09-30 18:23:30 Oil spray.  Works great.

Earwigs are harder.  Roll up anything and put at base of plants.  Earwigs hide within it.  If you're kind hearted, put in freezer.

5936 2018-09-30 18:21:56 Oil prices have risen steadily. Petrol prices not all down to new Tax. Secondly Rents began to rise substantially from 2012. This in direct correlation to the Housing bubble.  Residential Real Estate market  has steadied in 2018. Your Govt was in charge while rents spiralled.
5937 2018-09-30 18:21:55 I'm really glad the rest of the world is catching on to how great coconut tastes and is putting it in everything. But coconut oil will forever be the stuff my granny puts in her hair, you won't see it in my pots anytime soon.
5938 2018-09-30 18:21:54 Texans love their oil. Oilmen love them Republicans. 
They have no conscience; they vote for their party over their country.
5939 2018-09-30 18:21:52 Jake’s Soul Food then gave me a thigh and leg (it said wings on the menu) soaked in car oil, worcestershire sauce, and sugar. Weak ass Mac n cheese and cornbread.
5940 2018-09-30 18:21:47 Yeah true that's a possibility but what r the other cheaper options for oil supplies; Russia already under sanctions North America n Mexico too far, Venezuela already reeling under suffocating US sanctions; with other Gulf countries problem of terror/conversion funding remains

5944 2018-09-30 18:21:12 Use baby powder to get baby oil off your skin. I'm sure it helps to get it off the floor as well. Idk if itll help with stains or not though.
5945 2018-09-30 18:21:00 It takes a while to find your routine. Eggs, bacon, asparagus, cheese, burger, olive oil, salmon. Deli meat and cheese in a pinch for lunch. I lost 20lbs in a month.
5946 2018-09-30 18:20:52 No you use the oil from the various plants mixed with Sodium Hydroxide, butter and water! They probably can find these stuff in the school tbhh

5968 2018-09-30 18:18:21 My mom asked me why we were almost out of cooking oil 
5969 2018-09-30 18:18:19 So, yeah please do send a pipeline to Saint John (EnergyEast). That way we can reduce cost and risk of rail traffic, improve our economy, and use Canadian oil instead of oil from other nations. Then we can focus on using all that money to research and develop greener technology.

5972 2018-09-30 18:17:55 It seems to be a uniqely Canadian attitude to believe we have to sell oil.  Saudis do not have to sell oil. Norway does not either.  But us Canadians, we need to keep selling the U.S. oil.  Or so we are led to believe.

6049 2018-09-30 18:07:06 They do, and we also export and import oil to accomplish this. What I desire is to have more than just a US market for exports (TransMountain) and to reduce import from nonCanadian sources (EnergyEast).

6058 2018-09-30 18:06:07 Lavender oil is really heaven sent 
6059 2018-09-30 18:06:07 Kicking diplomats means nothing. It's just a show. First sanctions were passed by Congress. Trump had no choice. What's important is the oil prices again went up. Russia is back making a lot of money. Thanks Trump.

6061 2018-09-30 18:05:58 Have an issue with oily hair? Pay close attention to the products you use! (Ex. Styling gels) Make sure they say "greaseless" or "oil free"
6062 2018-09-30 18:05:58 You’ve got to try it Michelle.  Delicious. The Olivio sounds like one for the shopping list. I grate garlic into oil and leave it in a ramekin for a few days, but like you say, any longer isn’t good. It can poison you if left too long I think.  Xx
6063 2018-09-30 18:05:53 I've arrived at more than a few airports where mechanics pulled a ladder up to the engine…when asked, a common response was "engine data reported a need to add oil."

Amazing tech.
6064 2018-09-30 18:05:52 @gorillaphent I think you might be able to hook him up with a beard oil supplier.

6067 2018-09-30 18:05:39 ALready on the brink fucking with Syria. Russias ally. "We are fighting terrorists." Bullshit it's all about oil always has been.
6068 2018-09-30 18:05:32 'Kay, listen here bud, you get mad at me for you yelling at me. I get mad at you, you get mad at me, it always happens. Water and oil don't mix.

6071 2018-09-30 18:05:19 I toss potatoes, turnip, carrots with a bit of olive oil and whatever seasoning I'm in the mood for then cook on 400 until tender. 
6072 2018-09-30 18:05:10 #healthtip I love essential oils, peppermint oil is beneficial for oral care, so I sprinkle a bit on my toothbrush with my coconut oil toothpaste 
6073 2018-09-30 18:05:07 He did. I think that people who analyze economics and oil and all the various factors get really into how to quantify the carbon factor. We all have to pay for it, somehow. We, the consumers, demand the carbon. So, we, the consumers, should pay for at least some of that demand.
6074 2018-09-30 18:05:02 For real. What does an oil baron do? He crushes his opponent without mercy!
6075 2018-09-30 18:04:53 Lies this big, Donnie must have a hand in it. Sun light FREE oil not free.
6076 2018-09-30 18:04:47 May your spirit be refreshed and may the heavens open upon you. I release a fresh oil on every aspect of your mininstry. No more spiritual, physical and financial dryness. #7SN #SupernaturalOpenings @MatAshimolowo
6077 2018-09-30 18:04:37 The obvious soloution is to hold stock in the oil companies. I do and I can tell you the margins are remarkably thin. Prov and Fed taxes are most of the cost at the pump.  Cap & Trade was next to nothing and paid for services that most will need at some point in life.
6078 2018-09-30 18:04:37 Basel-iii guidelines have categorized equity assets as high risk, banks are not interested in equity assets, Govt of India with rising oil prices wants to keep inflation in chk, tightening liquidity to avoid food inflation in election year, ext factor:increase in US interest rate
6079 2018-09-30 18:04:32 Why are they called "oil beetles"?

6082 2018-09-30 18:04:16 Govt can also decrease the import duty or excise duty on crude oil to give certain relief to comman citizen.
6083 2018-09-30 18:04:13 The malvinas already cost us too much in human life, and in money. 2000 penguin worriers cant dictate the political direction of 60 million.
Give the rock back to Chile, Argentina or the penguins. 

We wont be forced to subsidise you so big oil can destroy the environment.

6087 2018-09-30 18:03:42 When Trump goes down @VP  and more than half of the @SenateGOP is going with him. Trump is the main head of this thing this two-headed serpent. We only need to remove one and the others will  return to the bottomless swamp. His snake oil has  corroded the moral fibers of Amerca!

6092 2018-09-30 18:02:46 I don't see a Rutta-type as someone they'll go after, at least I hope not. Don't see him being an upgrade on what they already have. Really hope Benning gets a serious look on the PP this year.

6098 2018-09-30 18:01:58 I appreciate this truth. Now ask prominent @coloradodems why they are hedging? Why has democrat @matthewogray #HD33 taken money from Anadarko? Why is his opponent Eric Rutherford of Superior the only man principled enough to stand up to oil & gas?

6100 2018-09-30 18:01:27 Reilly has to be hurt as he can't make the throws with any accuracy right now. This is a coaching test for Maas right now which is to amp up his team but keep them confident and not panicked. McLellan failed doing that last yr as I believe the Oil lost their confidence & panicked
6101 2018-09-30 18:01:23 Fair  point Paulina Suspect we could safely add in tree nuts like walnuts pecans and almonds along with olive oil
6102 2018-09-30 18:01:21 Our oil age will not end through lack of it, but by fighting over what’s left.

So choose your luck‐factor and take that thought where you will,

 Many reasons are given for starting wars, but ultimately there is only one: the pursuit of (energy) resources.
6103 2018-09-30 18:01:19 2000 islanders and penguin worriers that cost us a fortune can't seriously be considered as a factor in how we rin this country.
The malvinas just aren't that important. Sorry. 

I dont care if big oil has found a way to make money. They already cost us too much in human life.

6110 2018-09-30 18:00:38 Even before watching it, I completely agree with the hypothesis of this tweet. Why? The civil wars in places like Angola and Mozambique went on for decades, but the oil extraction went on unperturbed, you'd think it's North Dakota.
6111 2018-09-30 18:00:30 oh yeah, those poor poor oil companies.  God forbid they develop long term strategies for expanding into other energy sources so they are not hurt badly by the inevitable movement away from oil.

6120 2018-09-30 17:59:10 I've heard about the glue/finish sensitivity but I guess unfinished pine would emit oil.  Did they test for other coniferous trees?  (spruce, fir, etc)
6121 2018-09-30 17:59:04 Can't do it. Outrage account is overdrawn. 
Maybe next month if I can budget it.

6125 2018-09-30 17:58:26 @JoeSilverman7 southern granny who was child during Depression. Spent quality time pressing everything in the house, dusting mahogany dining room sets w/ lemon oil and q-tips in woodwork. 
own house? no iron anything, Ikea windex smooth.
6126 2018-09-30 17:58:19 That second photo could be a beautiful oil portrait
6127 2018-09-30 17:58:02 It doesn't make sense.... Big oil backers always bashing ethanol or Biodiesel.  They get to retail it and set the prices.   it's not like we can buy it direct from the plants.  
6128 2018-09-30 17:58:01 If we are now number one oil producer how is that reflected in our gas prices. I drive 45 min to and from work. If net neutrality prevented better service why is it that services that already existed cost more. Shouldn’t internet be cheaper while getting faster.

6134 2018-09-30 17:57:08 Yeah, definetly looks like oil, around where the oil goes into the prop I reckon. Don't know if Cirrus have fire bottles, I don't think there are many SEP's with fire systems. Good effort on that landing, though, a decent A check it'll be ready to go.

6140 2018-09-30 17:56:37 I live in CA not 30 minutes from a Chevron refinery.  Gas is higher here than just about anywhere else, on average.  Has always been this way.  Oil companies sell it for what people will pay... Unfortunate but true.

6143 2018-09-30 17:56:31 Here we go. Buhari caused the recession by crashing oil prices and poured the savings of the GEJ admin who sold oil for $100/barrel in the excess crude oil account into the Atlantic ocean.
6144 2018-09-30 17:56:13 I think tea tree oil won the game 
6145 2018-09-30 17:56:08 They have a liquid version(brand is dr teals) that i just pour around the bath before a shower and the hot water makes the  smell fills up the bathroom, its p nice.

Also when in doubt get a bunch of essential oil rollers for inflammation
6146 2018-09-30 17:56:07 Lmao! Mayo, mustard, oil, and vinegar

6152 2018-09-30 17:55:23 Trump talks abt bringing jobs & industries back... so why doesn’t he invest in sustainable American energy instead of spending billions a day overseas on oil ????
6153 2018-09-30 17:55:22 If u take handful (or spoon full of food), it has salt, grains, ghee/oil, sour taste, sweet taste, spicy,bitter, etc, but all these make the food ! Isn’t it? So,you no rule the difference & make only one taste ,like wise a society! Only difference is the way we think or made to!
6154 2018-09-30 17:55:20 Doesn’t matter what u think brother, it’s fact. These companies r looking 20, 40, 50 years out. The writing is in the wall. They r all looking to diversify hence they r now “energy companies”, not “oil companies”.  Makes sense to learn from ur detractors, Sun Tzu thought so.
6155 2018-09-30 17:55:12 You guys should be using anointing oil before leaving the house

6157 2018-09-30 17:54:47 @KingSalman @realDonaldTrump  The U.S.A keeps claiming we are the oil exporter, and that we are oil rich. Lets have the Trumps prove the oil rich. GWB "proved it" in 2005 and 2006. @HHSHEIKHMAJID @HHSheikhMohamm1
6158 2018-09-30 17:54:36 Coconut oil always maximizes my waxes and shaves. It’s the best thing for smoothness in the genital area. I can vouch.

6165 2018-09-30 17:53:50 B12 is just one of many. Grains, sugar, veg oil (all plant foods) contribute to chronic disease, not good meat. Indians have very low meat consumption, but high rates of CVD, diabetes.

6169 2018-09-30 17:53:03 It is simply the lies, the pattern of lies, the habit of lies that extends throughout his GOP career. Will a few good men get this? Ketchup is not a vegetable, trees do not cause global warming, oil does not form in, 5000 years, Putin’s soul cannot be seen in his eyes. And Brett?

6171 2018-09-30 17:52:52 Please name one “fish oil” trial that had a positive CV outcomes effect.  In fact there have been multiple trials on OTC fish oils and they have ALL failed.  The data is clear. $AMRN
6172 2018-09-30 17:52:49 Then @realDonaldTrump should yell at himself for high oil prices.
6173 2018-09-30 17:52:49 I can't get used to humidity.  I like it because it is good for my skin and my furniture (lived in Vegas & had to oil wood furniture a lot).  I HATE to sweat!
6174 2018-09-30 17:52:42 The oil baron made me laugh too hard because he committed to it so intensely. I annoyed @realAmandaWard.

6192 2018-09-30 17:50:10 houthis represents 50-100k in a country of 26m. they have no right whatsoever in taking over the country, letting al qaeda run riot, sending 199 rockets to saudi, and bombing oil shipping routes in the red sea.
6193 2018-09-30 17:50:05 Do you know how much it would cost for Medicaire for all? And that includes all border crosser's that would flood into our country with open borders. It would bankrupt us into real Socialism like oil rich Venezuela which doesn't even have toilet paper for all.
6194 2018-09-30 17:49:58 For the last 5 years, Cruz's only value to me was as the embodiment of a politician you could never trust, support, vote for, much less stand to listen. He was the snake oil grifter who made it to the show.

6196 2018-09-30 17:49:48 @RitzCrackers is one of the brands that are still buying dirty palm oil from rainforest destroyers! The first step to stop deforestation is to stop working with companies like Wilmar. #DropDirtyPalmOi
6197 2018-09-30 17:49:45 Midnight Oil, I love you.......... 
6198 2018-09-30 17:49:37 Check out badagry express way. There are deep gullies there, not potholes. Btwn barracks and okokomaiko, 3 trailers fell today alone. One oil empty tanker that fell days ago at iyana oba, is still there.
Thank God that tanker was empty.
6199 2018-09-30 17:49:27 I’d explain it as matter-of-factly as it is: our oil industry isn’t in demand because of its heavy product/hard to refine. 

I’d also let them know that I had my wage cut/friends lost their jobs when we worked as public servants for $12/hr. Some of us found new careers. #hint
6200 2018-09-30 17:49:25 Yes we have this great pizza place that has 18” pizza and homemade bread rolls and they serve garlic oil with spices as a dipping sauce. Oh my gosh! You would not believe how good it taste.
6201 2018-09-30 17:49:23 อ้าว
6202 2018-09-30 17:49:14 It’s not making it worse. Do you realize this war is all over oil? Yemen is right next to Saudi Arabia, Iraq is next to Saudi Arabia. Do you get the pattern here?

6204 2018-09-30 17:49:04 P.S. Calling people soyboy is kind of soyboyish, along with twitter.Long days working two weeks on and two weeks off in the Arctic oil field
6205 2018-09-30 17:49:01 Extreme knitting ;) I abused a plastic knitting needle in the process of fettling the MZ. It was the perfect size for the oil line :)
6206 2018-09-30 17:49:01 @NDP still grappling with the Saudi blood oil import question.  The NDP is all for women rights but still accepting oil from a nation that crops the heads off female dissidents.  Of where can Canada get the oil?  #fkgclowns
6207 2018-09-30 17:48:50 What a wonderful sendoff last night. I'm lucky to have terrific friends in my life. I will miss you all. Thank you @labuzamovies for being a great host/master chef. Thank you @_sad_dad for taking us to disco night at Oil Can Harry's. The perfect end to my 24+ yr stint in So Cal.

6219 2018-09-30 17:47:21 Laws across several EU countries governing the use of cannabis oil for medicinal purposes are archaic and idiotic. Grandmother, 80yrs, could face up to 6yrs in jail in BG if I mail-order oil from Amsterdam to help reduce her trembling and allow her to feed herself.
6220 2018-09-30 17:47:04 Another bullish sign for oil!
6221 2018-09-30 17:47:04 We need to stop taking oil out of the ground a long time before it runs out to avoid climate catastrophy.

Their oil is also state owned.

6233 2018-09-30 17:45:38 No! They sell auto parts (which could include oil). The brake pad division was a new endeavor hoping to be successful enough to save the company. They were the future of Callahan Auto Parts, which is why he needed to go out and sell the hell out of them.

6235 2018-09-30 17:45:26 For aftercare, try using a massage oil
6236 2018-09-30 17:45:26 Quite a few come to mind... @DrJenGunter fights the good fight against the snake oil salesmen of the world. @JanelleMonae is just amazing and awesome in everything she does. @GailSimone is always worth reading, especially on comic books.
6237 2018-09-30 17:45:04 Lmao saw a post on Snapchat that said “Ionoo who daughter need to hear this but get a oil change” and i just thought of @bvtch_imdvpe 
6238 2018-09-30 17:44:59 Meaning?
6239 2018-09-30 17:44:57 Yeah honestly I went through a “trying alternative healthier fats” phase but most of them are just not for me. All I ever use is EVOO or sesame oil for stir fry.
6240 2018-09-30 17:44:51 It works tho. I go use the coconut oil
6241 2018-09-30 17:44:45 Beard update #2 finally trimmed up so I don’t go full neck beard. Not as itchy anymore but I’ve got some fancy oil things on their way to make it not itchy and grow more full. #gettingthere
6242 2018-09-30 17:44:42 Ugh I know I used everything cocoa butter, stretch mark lotion, bio oil.. everything
6243 2018-09-30 17:44:40 I’m sat in a Chinese restaurant smelling of massage oil.... that’s me, not it.
6244 2018-09-30 17:44:39 @theinkeylist hi there ! I'm keen on buying your retinol and your rose hip oil but I wanted to reach out for some advice . Would you advise applying retinol first then the oil or vice versa ? Thanks in advance 
6245 2018-09-30 17:44:38 I’m an idiot. Definitely thought this was a perfume oil

6254 2018-09-30 17:43:40 I guess palm oil is in my favorite creamer and butter  I’ve been trying to cut it
6255 2018-09-30 17:43:37 I don't really trust the major  palm oil certification so effectively trying to stop buying any products with it

6258 2018-09-30 17:43:06 I don't know why it works but mix mint oil with a carrier oil, apply to feet, put on socks, let kid sleep and fever leaves.
6259 2018-09-30 17:42:57 All of my dream vacations involve fresh seafood, and caprese, and red peppers, and olive oil, and vinegar.

6261 2018-09-30 17:42:39 Wonder how many babies were born to teenage girls 9 months after the summer party season.  How many abortions during summer/early fall?  Back then, teenage pregnancy was kept under wraps. Huge embarrassment to family. Girls often sent away to private boarding school, babyadopt
6262 2018-09-30 17:42:33 - Vat increase funded free tertiary education
- tax increase bolstered govt spending
- fuel levy was when oil was at lowest in 5 years further improving govt cash flow
- SARS issues a culmination of moyane and gordhan feud.

Give @mgigaba a break.
6263 2018-09-30 17:42:20 Ali Kardar, the managing director of the National Oil Company, announced that he would negotiate a contract with a Russian company for the signing of the IPC Agreement, under which Iran currently has access to all its oil money / ISNA #OOTT
6264 2018-09-30 17:42:17 after the phenomenal hike in oil prices, but it was bigger than undivided Punjab. It had enough resources to give a fair deal to its six million inhabitants.
6265 2018-09-30 17:42:09 How’s it going to do with a oil fire?
6266 2018-09-30 17:42:02 @MatPatGT deficiency. An above ground aquaculture enclosure allows them to grow food to help feed them but they need the fish oil more than anything to treat the Ricketts that's hitting their population. D is very hard to get in the human diet NORMALLY. But underground its worse.

6276 2018-09-30 17:41:08 i use peppermint oil on my temples and neck, drinking enough water before the period starts isnso important. also monk‘s pepper regulates hormones naturally, it helped me A LOT (my gynaecologist recommended it), all pms and menstrual symptons got so much better also with yoga.
6277 2018-09-30 17:41:01 Wow. Is this what our opposition is concerned about? You have passion about incarceration and punishment but you would put your children’s future at risk supporting expanding oil and other GHG emitting resources? You should be in jail!
6278 2018-09-30 17:41:01 Have you met my oily skin? Give me 10m in the Florida sun & I’ll make you some oil.
6279 2018-09-30 17:40:52 Thinking about starting to do yoga again. (This CBD oil is really fucking with my brain. In a good way.)
6280 2018-09-30 17:40:52 Been there, done that, horrible at it. Born in the country, live in the city, miss the country. I know plenty of farmers, ranchers, and oil field workers. They do jobs I can't do. Them doing their jobs, enable the cities to exist. Try again, or better yet, don't.
6281 2018-09-30 17:40:49 Did some dumb shit and drove to Texas on 50% oil life a month and a half ago like fuck it! Took it to the shop for a service the other day and that mf said fuck me ! I was upset but then my wallet said fugggg it and saved my life

6283 2018-09-30 17:40:26 That is not an example that works here. Prof Blasey Ford does not have the character of a snake oil salesman as you imply which is exactly what's wrong with your argument. You are, even after her highly credible testimony inferring that she is not telling the truth. Ithink she is

6291 2018-09-30 17:39:08 Well you have schools where I live that are tiny (Tilden Tx) but have huge funds from oil and gas money that are sitting on huge surplus. One possibility is making it state run not local, but that’s another thing I’m not as keen on. Like I said real difficult decision.
6292 2018-09-30 17:38:52 Exfoliate your face, neck and hands with a mixture of baking soda and olive oil. It is very gentle, and keeps skin very soft and smooth.
6293 2018-09-30 17:38:48 The engine data I have seen would not have baro press and volts. N1/EPR, ITT, oil press/temp, bleed valve position, bleed press…that sort of thing.

6296 2018-09-30 17:38:43 That is so wonderful! Yes, tasty liquids like tuna water can get my cats to eat. I've heard beef broth or goat milk can be good for Hydrating animals too. I sometimes add Avocado oil, or beef or pork fat to their food to up calories. Thinking of you 
6297 2018-09-30 17:38:35 I have a question for her brother instead of arguing with Nithya why can’t you settle your sisters life and get her a kilavan with olive oil business and buffalo farm

6313 2018-09-30 17:36:14 I have a theory - Lewis engine is oozing abit of oil, he reported engine misses - they reversed the order for maximum points today as a possible grid penalty in Japan coming and that’s what they were going to explain to BOT?

6339 2018-09-30 17:33:17 They even forgot strategic importance of Bangladesh: after oil is exhausted, it can supply natural gas to meet indian requirement of 200 years. China connecting via bullet train.
6340 2018-09-30 17:33:07 おやすみなさい～！！
6341 2018-09-30 17:33:02 tomorrow i’m going to the bush for a month and i want to pack small thing that make me feel good. so far, i’ve got a beeswax candle, frankincense essential oil, and my moccasins. any suggestions of things i should also take?
6342 2018-09-30 17:33:01 I was considering trying quark instead of cream cheese for carrot cake topping next time. Thanks for trying it for me and saving me the bother. 
I once used large eggs instead of medium and thought I could therefore reduce the oil content. Mistake - very rubbery.
6343 2018-09-30 17:32:48 Just enjoyed a full English, sans bread, beans and owt potatoey - obvs, but adulterated with broccoli. Broccoli sautéed in beef dripping, mushrooms in Kerrygold and eggs fried in olive oil. So a good range of nutrient-rich natural fats. Success! #hflc #lowcarb
6344 2018-09-30 17:32:34 I fucking love the smell of olive oil
6345 2018-09-30 17:32:16 Definitely tea tree oil like recommended above but also drinking green tea consistently gets rid of that sweet blood smell!!
6346 2018-09-30 17:32:10 I can include some Riley’s Recipe vouchers. Aloe Flaxseed Gel and an Original Oil Mix.
6347 2018-09-30 17:31:53 Is John Cena's entrance theme (a dozen years old?) the most current music the Colts' play at Lucas Oil Stadium?
6348 2018-09-30 17:31:53 Then you're being intellectually dishonest. It's not my belief system, it's logic. If a snake oil salesman convinces you his product cures Lupis, does that make him credible?
6349 2018-09-30 17:31:35 There will always be "useful idiots".

The one that pain me pass is allowing parasitic north to be benefiting from our oil wealth, due to our church mind and they have the effrontery to question how money was used by GEJ.

6358 2018-09-30 17:30:05 Just put them in. I'm winging it tonight - NO MEASURING. All I know is you wang them into HOT oil and usually everything's ok.
6359 2018-09-30 17:30:02 I got my 2009 C63 for $26k out the door about 2.5yrs ago.  It had 103k on the clock.  I just did the dreaded head bolts, lifters, and one camshaft.  It’s taken an alternator (bought from you) as well.  People freak at 9L of oil, but it’s once a year!  Pricing brakes and other...

6375 2018-09-30 17:27:42 At first glance I thought it said “old baby oil” 
6376 2018-09-30 17:27:33 1) Truck-carrying-Containers 2) Good Refineries 
3) Focus more on other economic sector not only oil
4)Good Governace #WehailNigeria #Nigeriaat58
6377 2018-09-30 17:27:30 Yes we would. We were discussing this with an Alberta PM who had a majority.

Mind you, if the oil were already near a port... But it isn't. So no point speculating.
6378 2018-09-30 17:27:24 มาค่ะ พร้อม
6379 2018-09-30 17:27:09 Imagine a country full of cars that can no longer be driven because the oil has never been changed.

6386 2018-09-30 17:26:30 wow using paper towels from the communal bathroom to wipe the oil off of your face makes u feel like a new person
6387 2018-09-30 17:26:10 Decent number of oil names may be turning around.  Select names that are either setting up or have recently broken out of constructive bases: $CLR $OAS $GTLS $CVI $HFC $WPX $ETP $PVAC $WLL $WHD $DNOW $PBF
6388 2018-09-30 17:26:07 Whats the method of fish... Would you rather use oil or a open fire.. the fish swims in water & fire burns... I like open range fires

6391 2018-09-30 17:25:53 Drop in world oil prices is always good chance for companies to sell-off assets for consolidation.  Other factors at work too.
6392 2018-09-30 17:25:51 The snake oil salesman has tainted the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh
6393 2018-09-30 17:25:49 That feeling when you just scrubbed your whole ass body and apply your body lotion/cream/oil. That hydration nation 
6394 2018-09-30 17:25:46 Hmm, what works for me is a cleanser with tea tree oil! I'm not really sure if it's recommended for sensitive skin though, but I've heard seaweed extract is good for sensitive skin! 

Also I've been into exfoliating masks lately and it helped with my blackheads a lot!
6395 2018-09-30 17:25:46 Yeeha!  Come on Texas and other oil producing States. Get those rigs moving. @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz @GregAbbott_TX

6397 2018-09-30 17:25:44 Intermittent oil pressure light on in the Toyota. Any ideas? Rick Hamer
6398 2018-09-30 17:25:41 Rising oil prices are prompting forecasts of a return to $100 a barrel for the first time since 2014, creating both winners and losers in the world economy. Exporters would enjoy bumper returns but consuming nations would bear the cost at the pump, potentially fanning inflation.

6400 2018-09-30 17:25:35 The rate at which Man utd are going down ehnnnnnn ,They would soon discover Crude Oil!!!
6401 2018-09-30 17:25:03 Ok, the theft of the oil was a fringe benefit.  I believe your basic premise is correct.  I remember the U.S. military training both Iraqi and Iranian bomb-dropping pilots here in the U.S. to pit them against each other, thereby weakening them before coming in for the kill.
6402 2018-09-30 17:24:51 Wild Growth Hair Oil works...its at Sally Beauty Supply && I believe its $8 or $9

6407 2018-09-30 17:24:15 Awesome.... and keep in mind Henry Ford raised the wage of his factory workers so they could AFFORD TO BUY the cars they were building. also, the very first car he made was _electric_. then oil was discovered, and gasoline refining began. #FAIL since then
6408 2018-09-30 17:24:12 Prices are actually regulated by the gasoline companies based on supply and demand. My assertion was that with us being the largest oil producer (for now), we would have more control over supply; thereby lowering prices because we could fill our reserves and relive demand.

6491 2018-09-30 17:14:52 To plump up lips, apply peppermint oil.
6492 2018-09-30 17:14:50 Shouldn't be surprised at Lucas Oil Stadium... but Colts just scored TD! Probably 0-7... #HOUvsIND
6493 2018-09-30 17:14:46 I love castor oil so much..... it really  helped my eyelashes and now I don't need to use mascara anymore 
6494 2018-09-30 17:14:42 寝てもいいんだけど寝たら負けな気がする 何に負けるかはわからない
6495 2018-09-30 17:14:42 I had eczema all over my face too! The it cosmetics cc cream works ok for me.. also putting on an oil before your makeup! & Manuka Honey!!! 
6496 2018-09-30 17:14:33 tonight i’m listening to oil of everypearl’s un-insides and turn off the light
6497 2018-09-30 17:14:29 American Oil Beetle also called Meloe
6498 2018-09-30 17:14:25 Oooo I’ve never used castor oil before, I’ll have to try that! 
6499 2018-09-30 17:14:24 You must be on some powerful shit he doesn't love football this was merely something to do. His father is an oil millionaire are you serious?  #gtfoh
6500 2018-09-30 17:14:23 I'm torn. I've listened to Asian pop from the 90's on, so in my neighborhood it was Christina Aguilar (NOT Aguilera), Tata Young and Lift & Oil that caught our attention. Asking who opened the door is a matter of opinion. #BTS just happened to bust down & destroy that open door

6504 2018-09-30 17:14:06 Almost all of my jeans that i wore around mike has oil stains on them from the bike and the vehicles  and i can for sure tell you what stain is from what.. haha
6505 2018-09-30 17:13:44 งื้ออ 777 หนูบินไปแย้ววว
6506 2018-09-30 17:13:43 i like argan oil or rosehip. i know theres some at tjmaxx
6507 2018-09-30 17:13:39 I believe they actually specialize in break pads not oil.
6508 2018-09-30 17:13:34 I actually kind of liked I love it when it came out but it was done poorly on SNL. Water bottles were stupid and too on the nose, both rappers rapped poorly, baseline stolen from David morales, also Teyana would have done better alone. Oil dad skit was funny tho.
6509 2018-09-30 17:13:28 Good. Now, the next time American media lash out at Saudi Arabia for anything related to oil, they should look in the mirror first.
6510 2018-09-30 17:13:26 ไว้คราวหน้าน๊าาา
6511 2018-09-30 17:13:23 Have you by chance tried mixing it with coconut oil instead of water when you want a paste? I mix almond and coconut together frequently. So I'm thinking that this mix could be quite good! And it gets you the fat you crave. I may need to seek out this jar.
6512 2018-09-30 17:13:10 Selfies are such a boring way to show off how good you look. I much prefer to turn people into oil paintings of myself instead.

6515 2018-09-30 17:13:03 This is a black oil beetle!
6516 2018-09-30 17:12:58 Will buy some calming oil
6517 2018-09-30 17:12:55 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
6518 2018-09-30 17:12:49 Do they have surfskis at @VillaCappelli or is Paul the olive oil source?
6519 2018-09-30 17:12:46 With all billions he is getting from taxpayers and the public capital markets he should be remaking Nicola Tesla’s electric car not ripping off the name and playing patty cake with big oil by keeping gas cars viable a few more years
6520 2018-09-30 17:12:43 Agreed! Maybe the first step is for people to understand what the different grades of Ooil are & what the terminology means. And, that it is specific to the olive oil sector. Outside of that sector terms EVirgin,Virgin,cold pressed have no standardised, regulated meaning.
6521 2018-09-30 17:12:30 Trump did 9/11. And the BP oil spill. And Sandy Hook. And the Boston marathon. And Waco, Texas. And the Malaysia flight. And Hurricane Katrina. #im
6522 2018-09-30 17:12:26 One of the reasons why my mom is into oil diffusers is that she claims “everyone needs to calm down”. lmao 
6523 2018-09-30 17:12:14 Salads are great but the dressings can be VERY high in calories & fat. Choose olive oil & lemon.
6524 2018-09-30 17:11:47 Engine oil
6525 2018-09-30 17:11:34 *After a gap of six years, China is all set to resume import of oil meal from India, a move that could double India’s exports of rapeseed meal, popular cattle and poultry feed. As the trade war with the US has forced it to cut imports from the world’s largest economy.
6526 2018-09-30 17:11:20 I would say myself no. Especially when you literally have the exact same guy in Ryan Strome. And the Oil King Memorial Cup experience has proven to not workout in the big times!
6527 2018-09-30 17:11:19 We can’t trust anything he says at all anyway. What he says changes from moment to moment depending on how he wants to be seen to the audience he’s in front of. This is the very definition of a snake oil salesman or a ConMan. This is who Trump is.
6528 2018-09-30 17:11:12 ลองเทสเตอร์นังอินนิสsoybean energy oilคือดีอะ ชอบtextureมันแฮะ ออยแต่ซึมเข้าผิวเร็วชะมัดที่งงคือดึ๋งๆที่หน้าแต่มันไม่ได้มันอะงง55555555555555 ชอบอะต้องซื้อมาใช้แล้วมั้ยอะไรยังไง

6530 2018-09-30 17:10:45 Lol,   Like this fake ad isn't being paid for by Pinnacle West (APS) and their oil and gas magnate friends.
6531 2018-09-30 17:10:35 Even olive oil?
6532 2018-09-30 17:10:24 Gym, changed my oil & now football all day.

6534 2018-09-30 17:10:15 Deduction and other things, the oil is all of those people. The 9/11 Commission said that? Americans like 21 year old Sarah Root.
6535 2018-09-30 17:10:12 In 1947, The Government pays the U.S. $4,085,327.45 as final installment on a $29,137,700.84 settlement for expropriated American oil property.

6544 2018-09-30 17:09:27 Not really, I changed to acne scarred oil. It just changed the texture of skin to be really soft. (rosehip oil)
6545 2018-09-30 17:09:16 This client is off the gas grid.  They have gas for cooking,  open fires and Oil central heating (rarely used)  and extremely low energy appliances.

They have one EV and do an average of 15 miles on a trip, 3/4 times a week.

This client has a reserve of energy for powercuts.

6550 2018-09-30 17:08:53 There was no signs of explosives found here.  It was planes.  Planes!  No wait...it was...uhmm....an oil fire...yeah...and office furniture...yeah, that's it.
6551 2018-09-30 17:08:52 We'll bring fish lol, and oil, gas, renewables.....and a better attitude
6552 2018-09-30 17:08:49 Boiling oil/fat + naked skin is not a good combination ... hope that heals soon!
6553 2018-09-30 17:08:45 Scratching just spreads it, but I always end up scratching the shit out of myself in the shower. 

Just plain coconut oil?
6554 2018-09-30 17:08:43 I agree. It's more likely than not that the Saudis don't want oil prices down.
6555 2018-09-30 17:08:40 Plus oil and grease builds up on the roads if that road doesn't get regular rain to wash it away. So when you do get a downpour, it's like a skating rink. The same thing happens on Sydney roads.

6564 2018-09-30 17:07:52 I’ve never liked the awkward shadow lines on the field at Lucas oil with the roof open
6565 2018-09-30 17:07:50 I’m going back to Lucas Oil next weekend and PCD from #reptourindy is real.... and I just... I...

6567 2018-09-30 17:07:33 They have a type. Its the same people who gave our fish, oil, gas away.turned their back to our brothers in 6 counties when they were butchered. Took on german bank dept on our behalf. Secretly agreed with the church to not chase it for compensation and waited for victims to die.

6582 2018-09-30 17:06:00 @yasmeenrashid11 Madam, please try to place Ayesha Mumtaz in Punjab Food Authority. She did outstanding performance in that department. Health can not be improved without ensuring the quality of food available for public. adulteration in milk, oil and medicines is at top.
6583 2018-09-30 17:05:59 Naivete? The same CEOs that spent months and months meeting with Berman to discuss climate policy and oil sands development? Wow, you have a very low opinion of those CEOs.

6586 2018-09-30 17:05:16 Deepest sympathy Richard.
6587 2018-09-30 17:05:14 Big flaw in his plan.  Norway have built up a massive sovereign wealth fund from its energy reserves.  And they are as good as 100% self sufficient in renewables via large scale hydro.

Whereas we, burnt or sold it all our oil and gas off......

6592 2018-09-30 17:04:48 How long should oil change? I keep having bad experiences with dealerships taking forever to do my oil change. Time for someone to automate that process. It's not fast enough. #oilchange #carservice @CrownHondaSP

6610 2018-09-30 17:03:28 And I heard of voice in the midst of the beasts, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.
6611 2018-09-30 17:03:23 Yo are absolutely not self-sufficient, at current life-style. If you believe that, you are living in a fantasy world. I don't say this to insult you, or the US, I say it because it is absolute fact. You import millions of barrels of oil, every day, more than you can ever produce.
6612 2018-09-30 17:03:21 Well yea diesel lives on with 50 years of oil reserves left in the world...now is when industry will spike cost at the pump

6640 2018-09-30 17:00:34 It was inconsistent and Kanye was hot garbage, but the oil baron sketch was such a rare gem that it elevated the whole show.

6645 2018-09-30 17:00:08 J'aime une vidéo @YouTube : "[Shocking Science Experiment] Your Arteries With & Without Olive Oil" à l'adresse
6646 2018-09-30 17:00:03 I should see the wait time for Walmart’s autocenter. I need an oil change.
6647 2018-09-30 16:59:57 Or, sometimes I see something and twitter jumps and I can't find it again... so to whomever said something like "I hope this essential calming oil' helps... I wanted to ask... Are you bathing in it, cause life's a little wonky these days and normal dose may not work. :)

6650 2018-09-30 16:59:52 And Western Canada select is not the same oil as crude oil. It’s water down diluted Bitumen
6651 2018-09-30 16:59:49 Yeah I’m never getting box braids again. My edges are stressing me out. I need to get some Jamaican castor oil ASAP.

6653 2018-09-30 16:59:47 If oil goes up to $100 a barrel even more so..

2014 was the worst point in history to hold an Independence Ref..

2015 oil fell to $45

6657 2018-09-30 16:59:16 1 tbsp coconut oil (instead of butter), pineapple juice (or fresh pineapple), almonds or macadamia nuts, some shredded coconut, and brown sugar.

Pinch of ground star anise (just a pinch, it’s super strong) and some vanilla bean.

Brown sugar, vanilla extract, splash of Bourbon.

6660 2018-09-30 16:58:33 Oil output/OPEC?
6661 2018-09-30 16:58:26 Not holding out much hope; @JeffFlake wants to protect any lobbying jobs lined up, @SenatorCollins is pathetic - she will express "concern" but vote party line, and @lisamurkowski can be bought by opening up more oil drilling in Alaska
6662 2018-09-30 16:58:20 1-Ahmed's been making the point that US interventionism & imperialism in the region in order to counter Russian presence, spurr Israël's interests & promote US big Oil corp is essentialy the reason behind the islamist terrorism we've withnessed over the last few decades He also
6663 2018-09-30 16:58:18 wya ill try cus i gotta get a oil change nshit too & barry leaves at 6
6664 2018-09-30 16:58:18 US not exactly their robots, because they are in a sense joined at the hip because the US has oil interests which *coincide* with Zionist interests for land and water.
6665 2018-09-30 16:57:58 No #Italian would use a #refined #oliveoil. Be aware of #supermarket oil. And its not only supermarket but its also health stores sometimes.
6666 2018-09-30 16:57:53 Maybe terry Pegula should spend more money on creating bionic players who don’t get hurt. drill another oil well what a bad owner

6672 2018-09-30 16:57:16 Colts honoring the late Edwin Jackson and his family today at Lucas Oil Stadium
6673 2018-09-30 16:57:10 WOW. The world is abandoning future generations for greedy mindless and grossly irresponsible humans insatiable appetite of money. Stupid people incapable of anything creative relying on Mother Nature to rape. It’s clear that big oil is so powerful they can convince you to kill
6674 2018-09-30 16:57:09 Wonderful moment here at Lucas Oil pregame as the #Colts honor their former linebacker Edwin Jackson, who was killed earlier this year
6675 2018-09-30 16:57:09 I took a couple of low dose aspirin tablets and that has helped my kidneys release a little fluid so that's good. I scrambled three eggs with cheese and red habanero sauce and of course fried them in toasted sesame seed oil. I am now out of eggs but my cholesterol is high anyway

6678 2018-09-30 16:56:36 Ouch. Maybe that's why the quotes are sometimes $150. But the Ford ranger was easier than an oil change.
6679 2018-09-30 16:56:35 @realDonaldTrump dear pres.  I had faith that you are bringing down oil price, the dems on mid term, and tell the the U.S. iron companies not to take advantage of your tariff and charge us 100% more on building material, we use to pay for an cast iron elbow $6 china $12.5 US
6680 2018-09-30 16:56:34 I need to try this Black seed oil, but I'm scared lol
6681 2018-09-30 16:56:31 Donald Trump's outlandish approach towards Iran and Venezuela have created problem for all Crude/Gas importing countries, it's time for all oil buying countries to unite and force OPEC to increase production, else crude will make a new record in coming days.

6684 2018-09-28 23:59:40 I watched this interview, did not explain that we are paying more now than when oil was about $150.00 a barrel, at the moment oil is approx $38.00 a barrel ?? Are OPEC countries creating a deliberate shortage thus increasing the cost. 'Please explain' 
6685 2018-09-28 23:59:38 I can finally start oil paintings 
6686 2018-09-28 23:59:26 I watch too many crime shows.. I got an oil change and when I got home I thoroughly checked my car for a tracking device... smh

6689 2018-09-28 23:59:05 Oh I know. 

I just learned a local guy whom became intimate with a woman he rescued, from abusive relationship. She had a side boyfriend when he would leave town to work in Oil fields. One for the money, another for sex. 

Women are trouble and they give men a bad name.
6690 2018-09-28 23:59:02 Gotta change my oil tomorrow
6691 2018-09-28 23:58:58 Forget the oil, I’ve seen rats, I have no hot water, I was locked out of my room for 3 hours the other day, these tramps don’t clean up after themselves

6726 2018-09-28 23:55:50 I imagine right about now, Donald Trump is telling anyone who will listen this is great news, because it'll be a lot easier to drill for oil in national parks when all the vegetation has died and the wildlife has been displaced.
6727 2018-09-28 23:55:45 Debbie - it's hard to get us thinking outside the box.  Missing from all this is the US doesn't need the oil... If Iran gives up nukes we'd probably let Turkey, Iran & Saudi Arabia settle it....

6740 2018-09-28 23:53:52 I get oil change once a year. I don’t drive a lot.
6741 2018-09-28 23:53:46 I think the point of the oil is to give you the ability to raise the cook temp above a point where just plain butter would burn so they can be crispier or something
6742 2018-09-28 23:53:44 I remember drinking castor oil to help me go in labor. I was two weeks over due and a bitch was tired.

6745 2018-09-28 23:53:32 Dreams do come true.
6746 2018-09-28 23:53:14 Venezuela collapsed because their entire economy was a house of cards built on oil, and a drop in global oil prices made the whole country implode. Chavez set up a corrupt klepto-state that could only last as long as the oil money was rolling in
6747 2018-09-28 23:53:05 Yes agreed. And who knows, maybe they’ll uncover a Polaroid of him fingerbanging a passed out co-Ed and I’ll be eating crow. In the meantime get your ass over to Astoria Saturday. They have a huge kid area setup. Street chalk, hoola hoop, etc.
6748 2018-09-28 23:52:46 What did Paul Polman say about the mercury pollution in Kodaikalan they left and the decimation of the rain forest for their palm oil. Looks more like they are protecting their profits than the environment.

6770 2018-09-28 23:48:21 We Americans obviously set the bar to high when it comes to breathable air. I frequently self-waterboard using a little bit if coal oil, just to balance things out.
6771 2018-09-28 23:48:11 May I suggest 21. And then (please god) having messed around on NI there will be a soft border & then Scotland will be off too; removing oil revenues that systain the overcooked city fortunes & govt debt levels incurred by Cameron/Osborne - completing the fuster cluck of brexit
6772 2018-09-28 23:48:04 The idea isn't bad, but countries that value power over people will fight it or try to influence, those who create wars unrest to gain control of oil are responsible for major atrocities & wont agree with this. Important not to pick & choose the atrocities to be outraged about.

6778 2018-09-28 23:47:25 Dude, they were using palm oil in the 1800s. Chicken or egg is irrelevant given the relative size of each industry (last figures I saw had PK accounting for 5%of profit)
6779 2018-09-28 23:47:19 Oil, Telecoms, Gas, Franchises, Property... the list goes on. Deluded is you think the current money men behind Utd, Dippers, City etc are any different.  Is it the fact that the money is from that region that bugs u?  Utd..Saudi Telecom..Dippers..Fenway..
6780 2018-09-28 23:46:43 This recipe's pretty functional, it's Julia Child's basic "use medium high heat and equal parts oil and butter and you won't need much else" and she's right
6781 2018-09-28 23:46:34 People do not care about their oil consumption now a days its pretty bad
6782 2018-09-28 23:46:33 MCT oil mix with coffee no breakfast needed cuts down on carbs, gives you sustained energy until lunch, and burns fat. Works really well
6783 2018-09-28 23:46:30 I am so lucky. I am sitting outside with my dad and my fiance, while my fiance changes the oil on my momma and grams cars, listening to them talk about cars. Love that they get along

6788 2018-09-28 23:45:12 That my friends was how hard it was for us to speak up in the 1990s - our mothers wanted us married and our friends thought we were sluts.
6789 2018-09-28 23:45:11 Why stop at America? Oil oligarchy is transnational.
6790 2018-09-28 23:44:29 @Costco Sprained wrist trying to stir oil into my new peanut butter. Pls strong arm your supplier to package in shallow tubs. #shallowtubs
6791 2018-09-28 23:44:18 I told one class fellow in the summer of 91 before sophomore year and I remember that she too could not get past it somehow being my shame
6792 2018-09-28 23:44:11 The laws were put in place to affect black people, but have caused a ripple effect making more poor white people along with it, so they didn’t seem so racist...  but honestly, it’s corporate America/big banks/oil companies that are ruining America. 
6793 2018-09-28 23:44:04 "Big-picture Technical Outlook: EUR/USD, S&P 500, Gold & Oil Prices"
6794 2018-09-28 23:43:41 That sounds awful. Very sorry to hear this. Must be very hard to come. If the person is still in US, see if there can be prosecution against him?
6795 2018-09-28 23:43:38 عندي صورة بوريك اياها بحسابك ، صدفة مدري كيف جاية
6796 2018-09-28 23:43:21 Made that dough by hand, veggies out the garden, lots of olive oil. I'm in the ville, you can drop by anytime for some if you want it
6797 2018-09-28 23:43:18 ไปค่ะ เราเดมไปแล้วน้า
6798 2018-09-28 23:43:05 Maybe like some little chapter notes so you know where you’re tuning in.
6799 2018-09-28 23:42:56 I was in a fairly decent mood today until I came to get my oil changed, now I’m mad at the world. Oil changes DONT NEED TO BE SO FUCKING EXPENSIVE. I’m big mad yo.
6800 2018-09-28 23:42:38 Oil for one,  one for oil.
6801 2018-09-28 23:42:36 ไปด้วยกันมั๊ยคะ เราขาด 2 ที่
6802 2018-09-28 23:42:35 And the interesting part is that all of you who know me and are reading my tweets r too  self absorbed to retweet.
6803 2018-09-28 23:42:31 You can get face wipes that have tee tree oil infused in them (in the UK). That’s legit ALL I use on my face, other than showering everyday 
6804 2018-09-28 23:42:01 That makes sense. The pigments will add weight or if they're not well distributed will just filter out. Be like that oil, water, vinegar, dish soap, etc density experiment for kids. :D
6805 2018-09-28 23:41:55 Your website is perfectly clear and I would change nothing.
6806 2018-09-28 23:41:53 This Lime Kush oil smell amazing
6807 2018-09-28 23:41:51 Just deep fried my credit card in peanut oil instead of canola oil, hoping it might slim-down the monthly payment.
6808 2018-09-28 23:41:37 It does. But no large country can be as rich as Qatar with oil.  That was my point
6809 2018-09-28 23:41:13 my peppermint oil is almost gone SOS

6816 2018-09-28 23:40:11 I’m in love with gritty he’s like the anti mascot and it seems pretty flyers -esk . Not too sure about the oil can idea though 
6817 2018-09-28 23:40:05 I agree. However,  bc the field has a number of competing technologies and oil has been entrenched for 100y, it is not just the tech but it involves oil monopoly allowing their sites to be used. All about profits. 
Why would oil make way to H2 if they can stop it.

6819 2018-09-28 23:40:00 Thinking about tearing up #yeg tonight. Anyone want to meet at Oil City, Globe, or Iron Horse?! Drinks on meeeeeeee 
6820 2018-09-28 23:39:55 These charges have zero to do with stock prices. This is about trying to stop Tesla from changing the way our economy works. Half the top companies in the world are based on oil & cars. Electric cars hurt oil sales and cost a tenth of ICE to maintain. It will cost them billions.

6827 2018-09-28 23:39:01 *Put more oil on the kart* Heh HEH heh #Dingobot
6828 2018-09-28 23:38:55 Yeah. It's usually vegetable or canola oil that's butter flavored.

6831 2018-09-28 23:38:11 You beat those guys by talking over them and hinting you’re even more connected/higher up on the bloody ladder of their existence
6832 2018-09-28 23:37:47 Zinke is a joke, just like Trump. They only want to shrink the public lands so they can allow big oil and coal more land to drill. They should stop acting like all the American people are unintelligent and uniformed. We know who their lobbyists are.
6833 2018-09-28 23:37:46 Olive oil ayieee HAHAHAHA
6834 2018-09-28 23:37:39 good olive oil is absolutely life changing.
signed, someone who just had a life change from good olive oil.

6838 2018-09-28 23:37:12 I’m asking Kato Kaelin to dunk my head in an oil drum of vodka sauce.
6839 2018-09-28 23:37:02 Consort Express Lines' recent decision to cease shipping rice to #Bougainville is a result of #PNG's failure to pay what is owed to the #ABG. Economic downturn in #Bougainville has led to low freight volumes, which, combined with high fuel oil prices, has forced #Consort's hand.
6840 2018-09-28 23:36:57 I’ve never liked the analogy of data as oil. Oil is a precious, expendable resource. Data is not. Everyone *has* data but there is a vast gulf between the haves and have nots in terms of the ability to put that data to effective use.

6842 2018-09-28 23:36:34 Of course it’s amazing lmao it’s seasoned oil. The key to delicious food 
6843 2018-09-28 23:36:10 A bus driver helped me in my desperation, but a Pakistani man I knew since age 4 assaulted me. Pls don’t ignore my story but I know u will
6844 2018-09-28 23:35:56 It’s because he had lard all over the lens and camera. Should have used canola oil... even better lol
6845 2018-09-28 23:35:51 Baby oil gel that smells like baby oil >>>
6846 2018-09-28 23:35:51 Somebody send the FBI a few oil drums full of speed. #allnighter
6847 2018-09-28 23:35:45 Depends on the resin density. You would have to meadure the specific gravity or densoty carefully. typically Glucose and fructose are the only things more dense than resin that aren't toxic. Corn syrup is great for that, cheap, and not going to add oil to the waste.
6848 2018-09-28 23:35:45 Full disclosure: I still don't have an assigned VIN, but they are saying that since I have a delivery date, I am a priority.  I am thinking that the greasy wheels get the oil, so people who are pushing the process along may be first in line for actual deliveries. Update me @rws23

6852 2018-09-28 23:35:27 Only I can work 10 hour days, get dinner and be day drunk by 4:34 p.m.

6853 2018-09-28 23:35:23 Every time I buy fancy peanut butter with the oil on top I think: "Why'd you do that? Keep it simple stupid."
6854 2018-09-28 23:35:20 It's officially solidified coconut oil season in the Midwest! 

Brought to you by a desperate attempt to find news that doesn't focus on the fact that our elected officials have abandoned all signs of humanity.
6855 2018-09-28 23:35:19 Hell’va dozer man on a strip job I go get oil from. But damn I didn’t know the ole boy was this famous!! #D11

6857 2018-09-28 23:34:42 mmm tasty emulsions of pump oil and amino acids :9

you could sell it to health nuts as a youthful skin supplement. it was good enough for our earliest common ancestors, so..
6858 2018-09-28 23:34:42 @FrackFreeFour Your plight is serious miscarriage of justice from a judge who has a family interest in the oil industry. The sentence was completely out of proportion with other more lenient sentences given for grave offenses. There's massive groundswell of support for you guys.

6867 2018-09-28 23:33:30 I've also heard of people using oil to fill the bottom of tanks before. Not tried it myself cos I haven't needed to, but seems to work from what I've read
6868 2018-09-28 23:33:15 @skunkoilband review is up
6869 2018-09-28 23:33:13 In just 1 year + 1 day govt Temer organized 6 oil auctions. It removed PT rules and set a red carpet for Big Oil, aiming to raise investments and reduce Petrobras’ dominance. All blocks were sold today. “Brazil is now bigger than Petrobras”, Energy sec. Marcio Felix said

6873 2018-09-28 23:32:43 "BP, bringing oil to US shores."
6874 2018-09-28 23:32:01 That is not scientifally true. NASA just showed this. The global methane spike is 70% due to oil and gas. Animal Ag is important but no where near oil and gas and #fracking.
6875 2018-09-28 23:31:56 Someone just told be groundnut oil, cos red oil ain’t processed
6876 2018-09-28 23:31:42 Greyhound driver told me it’s Dec you can’t spend the night at the station, paid for my hotel. What sexual assault does to u but run u must.

6884 2018-09-28 23:29:49 If you are whining about giving Money to the North for Infrastructure, then please take $ 0.00 in oil and gas development and land sales in the North. That also includes ALL MONEY that will be generated with LNG. Then we can see how many bridges, tunnels will be built in the LML
6885 2018-09-28 23:29:47 After assualting me at Vassar this fucking Pakistani asshole transferred to Dartmouth where I was a student and perpetuated my trauma.
6886 2018-09-28 23:29:43 Thank you!
6887 2018-09-28 23:29:31 Remember to not get mixed up with drugs, gangs, or oil executives
6888 2018-09-28 23:29:31 Like cities unnaturally built in the wrong places, the wealth is in the wrong hands. 

Dubai and some of the gulf states are superficial places that should have never existed they way they are today, and like all unnatural things it will be vanish and deserted once oil is dry
6889 2018-09-28 23:29:27 Its....the oil they use to fry any sperm that is released so u won't get pregnant... Lmao

6898 2018-09-28 23:27:19 A bunch of friends were visiting him in Vassar. Omar Asghar Salam told us proudly he barged on women bathing in co Ed bathrooms.
6899 2018-09-28 23:27:17 Some dude robbed another guy’s wallet and used the stolen credit card to change his oil. The location of the oil change took his name and license plate. I guess people don’t rob cause they’re smart. 
6900 2018-09-28 23:27:17 It does make a lot of noise. Did you get the CBD oil yet?
6901 2018-09-28 23:27:14 British oil. Not Scottish.
You can't attribute all the oil funds to Scotland only.
6902 2018-09-28 23:27:10 Lol I got blocked too. She probably figured out we weren't going to buy her Holy Pot Oil that she grows in her backyard
6903 2018-09-28 23:27:01 Than why in the blue hell are you speaking on uniting with maga hats if you don't know any? That's the most illogical thing I've heard.Expand your horizons first, it makes you look silly when you want to unite with people you have never met.  Maga and kaepernick=oil and water.
6904 2018-09-28 23:26:55 Yess alam ko na pano gumising ng walang oil

6911 2018-09-28 23:26:12 Um, they are called Oil Sands.
6912 2018-09-28 23:26:10 I was supposed to give myself a hot oil treatment but I'll wait until tomorrow
6913 2018-09-28 23:26:04 Don't forget to keep up to date with the maintenance on your vehicle. Timely oil changes help prevent problems in the long run!
6914 2018-09-28 23:25:36 Plus their own set of degeneracy roots from pure desperation. Bert and Annie are like water and oil after all.
6915 2018-09-28 23:25:31 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund, until recently it had the publisher of the National Enquirer on its board, it has a mandate to support the oil companies and is working to introduce American style conservatism to Canada. It is propaganda, not news.

6917 2018-09-28 23:25:20 Trader Joe's olive oil popcorn is probably the healthiest snack that is a decent substitute for potato chips. It's rough though. I have been able to swap out French fries for oven roasted potatoes.
6918 2018-09-28 23:25:10 I'm tryna get a big enough essential oil steamer to hot box my room
6919 2018-09-28 23:25:05 @AldiUSA @AldiUK Your new Olive oil commercial airing in the USA is extremely creepy and off putting.
6920 2018-09-28 23:25:00 “Anxiety Recumbent - Oil on Canvas”
6921 2018-09-28 23:25:00 Yes... but probably not if they too were a big oil producing nation. It sucks but is a fact of life, for now anyway...
6922 2018-09-28 23:24:57 it seems you may be struggling with the great imponderable - did the chicken or egg come first 

make no mistake palm oil industry would be much smaller (&rainforests larger) if not for demand for animal feed 
6923 2018-09-28 23:24:20 I'm as big a Puljujarvi guy as you'll find and have been from the moment the Oilers drafted him but to call the kid a guy who will drive a line is more than a tad premature. Realistic expectations people, why is this so difficult?

6926 2018-09-28 23:23:18 I’ve just done a full body cleanse, exfoliate, and moisturise, sheet mask on my face and argan oil in my hair and let me tell you I feel like a brand new woman
6927 2018-09-28 23:22:48 This will help your son but I know it will not hurt him.  Regularly have hot soaks for 1/2 an hour in a bath as hot as possible with 2 cups of Epsom salt and 1 cup baking soda don't towel off but let the water dry. My guess a bit of eucalyptus essential oil may help also sea salt

6955 2018-09-28 23:19:31 Why do you think that PK is available and what do you think would happen to it if it were not fed to livestock.

My 2c is a good first step would be to make it mandatory for pruducers to put palm oil on the ingredient list if they use it like in the EU.

6967 2018-09-28 23:17:45 I overdid it with the tea tree oil today ... this shit dripping down my face

6971 2018-09-28 23:17:19 I’m not convinced a Hawaiian pizza with an olive oil base wouldn’t be better in my eyes
6972 2018-09-28 23:17:07 I was so traumatised after the experience I left in a daze - a girl out of Karachi alone in America. I took the bus out and headed to NH
6973 2018-09-28 23:17:02 It’s 00:15 on Friday night/Saturday morning and I’ve just bought a pill box, fish oil, probiotics, and a silk pillowcase online. Don’t tell me I don’t know how to live.
6974 2018-09-28 23:16:46 Yeah honestly most sweeter toppings work better with an olive oil base. Especially if they are sweet and acidic, the tomato makes it redundant
6975 2018-09-28 23:16:41 Even Russia isn’t like Qatar and it has more oil. How can nigeria be like that with so many people
6976 2018-09-28 23:16:33 I replaced ball joints, tie rods, control arms, sway bars, track bars, pitman arms etc.. on her Jeep about a year ago, and received nothing so far. I'd assume an oil change might warrant a smile.
6977 2018-09-28 23:16:26 America is such a shit show.... All lived in Hollywood land in the "American dream" u vote a business man tyrant into presidency and wonder why he only out for himself, u start wars u can't finish over oil, insist the fact that guns r legal has nothing to do with gun crime...

6988 2018-09-28 23:14:42 But like so many left-wing dupes the world over, the Venezuelan government did not view the oil industry as a business to be managed, but as a piggy bank to be raided. The results were 100% completely predictable.

7001 2018-09-28 23:11:59 Punch line: Venezuela and her citizens would be far better off, indeed among the wealthiest in the world, if the government had just let private industry run the oil industry.  The profit motive would have driven investors to modernize and increase production.

7005 2018-09-28 23:11:23 I'm buzzed for more tattoos soon but honestly I think I just do it for an excuse to lather myself in coconut oil 24/7
7006 2018-09-28 23:11:20 why risk it ? - what is the downside - 20 more years in the stone age ?
Its all political - there is need for support - big oil controls 45-50% Senate - without support, it too risky - just my take
7007 2018-09-28 23:11:15 How about bicycles? We need options. Potatoes are good but the Irish Depended on potatoes, and this is why they had a famine. If we run out of gasoline (oil crisis) we will be done,

7018 2018-09-28 23:09:43 Think about how much air that holds, all for some bouncy house. Could be paying kids orphanage bills or filling poor peoples cars with oil.
7019 2018-09-28 23:09:43 Everyone knows that #Venezuela nationalized their oil industry and in the process chased away private investment. Production predictably fell precipitously. Inflation is totally out of control and the currency is virtually worthless. See next tweet for punch line.

7068 2018-09-28 23:01:56 Nope... oil... extracted by foreign workers and terrorism ... that is the sum total of Saudi Arabia’s exports to the world... Germany needs Saudi oil... Canada does not.

7077 2018-09-28 23:00:37 Not only was the #UN #GeneralAssembly laughing at Trumpian bs, there was individual pockets of silent laughter aka Germany when #Trump tried to tell everyone the sky would fall in because of their oil contract with Trump's boss, #Putin.
7078 2018-09-28 23:00:34 Remittances from USA is Mexico's Top income source, over and above their crude oil production.

7079 2018-09-28 23:00:32 Your film-making contains the answer when you documented the Banking System & then The Military Industrial Complex via Cheney. But nobody is bigger than Big Oil/Energy. And they *own* the media lock stock and barrel. We're all supposed to politely ignore our impending doom here.

7088 2018-09-28 22:58:39 I haven't oil painted in like 2 years now. I'm much better with water colors and ink
7089 2018-09-28 22:58:29 It would make way more sense if everyone on the board had the exact same opinion on the oil sands.  The board would be far more credible that way.

7091 2018-09-28 22:57:40 lol idiots. If any of these people have eaten breakfast at a diner their eggs were likely cooked on the same flat top grill right where the bacon was cooked... You think they gunna spend money to oil that grill when the perfectly fine bacon fat is ALREADY there!?

7094 2018-09-28 22:57:11 Hmmm.... What does George have to hide. It may have something to do with oil... Or maybe torture? Or maybe it has to do with war, or doxing a CIA agent, or dealings with Enron...
7095 2018-09-28 22:56:56 So few vehicles failed, it was mostly a waste of time.  Listen, most lawnmowers and snow blowers that burn a gas oil mix are far worse than vehicles.
7096 2018-09-28 22:56:41 you posted that snap lol “oil change myself don’t need a man” like week or 2 ago

7102 2018-09-28 22:55:20 There will be huge lawsuits soon holding oil companies and oil governments responsible for the damage from climate change. BC should be suing Alberta now for the loss of the Interior Forests and all the jobs they supported.

7104 2018-09-28 22:55:13 Finally changed the oil in my car today 

Happy Friday (:
7105 2018-09-28 22:55:02 And I add that maybe someday Jeff will face what Judge Kavanaugh has, then maybe he'll see just how stupid he was today.
7106 2018-09-28 22:54:51 I can barely breathe this water thanks to YOUR oil spill.  Humans are heartless.
7107 2018-09-28 22:54:28 I'm amused. The denizens of the internet never fail to entertain. 

If you follow the technology and the intricacies of the oil, auto, and launch markets (including supply chains), the potential and its fragility is readily apparent. The choice is between 2 paradigms: new or old.
7108 2018-09-28 22:54:11 Imagine claiming to love your car but never checking your oil before the change.. couldn’t  be me
7109 2018-09-28 22:54:10 Ooh, I’m from Latin America and we always wash it too but we put salt and a little bit of oil when we cook it

7118 2018-09-28 22:53:16 I would use a tiny bit of either olive oil or coconut oil, sometimes even carmex
7119 2018-09-28 22:53:12 And upon all the wives be bereaved of my youth. And the sword to fall any more, till I make known to be baptized with the oil languisheth.
7120 2018-09-28 22:52:42 I thought I got a text and was really excited but it was just a reminder for me to take fish oil. Still cruisin.
7121 2018-09-28 22:52:22 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund, until recently it had the publisher of the National Enquirer on its board, it has a mandate to support the oil companies and is working to introduce American style conservatism to Canada. It is propaganda, not news.
7122 2018-09-28 22:52:20 What! THE DOUBLE SECRET COMMITTEE HOLDS NO POWER HERE! I demand justice!

The Adamandra will never be sea-worthy! He likes dogs! I like cats! We are water and oil!
7123 2018-09-28 22:52:10 Stop all shipping to and from Vancouver and area.  If you are going to stop oil being shipped in a small number of oil tankers, then do it to all ferries, cruise ships and all other sort of sailing vessels.
7124 2018-09-28 22:51:50 Oh look a Zinke oil pump jack. Doesn't it look grand along with the pipeline.  Of course it's not there. But it's coming just Google the new proposal For endangered species. Nothing to do with the better treatment of animals.
7125 2018-09-28 22:51:40 @JeffFlake How do you sleep at night? You vote for Kavanaugh but ask for an investigation. You look moral but your party gets their way. Didn't you used to sell snake oil to the sick?? #VoteThemAllOut #CowardFlake #GodHelpUs

7133 2018-09-28 22:50:58 I’d hardly call sticking up for ones self extreme tempermant. It’s also at bare minimum unfair to call someone a serial rapist based on 36 year old foggy allegations that none of your eye witnesses will corroborate. But that’s just me.
7134 2018-09-28 22:50:34 I do my own oil changes, so you better believe I always have latex gloves in the garage.

7137 2018-09-28 22:49:42 18:42 - @FIRECorbyG attended report of a car fire on High Street, Colsterworth. This was a false alarm caused by fumes from oil leaking onto the cars hot exhaust.
7138 2018-09-28 22:49:42 For the actual tweet she tweeted I doubt washing it two days in a row one time will hurt it butttt I wash my hair everyday and it’s fine  i feel like it catches too much dirt/sweat/oil if I don’t wash it every morning
7139 2018-09-28 22:49:42 I finally felt good enough to take my car in for an oil change. I know that doesn't seem like much, but I'm saying "Whoo-hoo!".
7140 2018-09-28 22:49:41 Fenty Pro Filtr is the most versatile foundation I’ve ever owned.

For a dewy look just add your favourite oil or moisturizer 

& for a more matte look, a SMALL amount of loose mattifying powder added makes it extremely full coverage (when on properly exfoliates & hydrated skin)
7141 2018-09-28 22:49:23 And always remember folks, don’t mess with oil companies profits
7142 2018-09-28 22:49:21 Is it necessary for them to adjust your seat and music when you get an oil change?
7143 2018-09-28 22:49:09 あん?俺を怒らせたなカチカチゴチゴチ黒焦げに揚げて欲しいのか⁈ いつものサラサラな俺じゃねえぞ
7144 2018-09-28 22:48:57 Add a little oil and chipotle sea salt. You can thank me later.
7145 2018-09-28 22:48:50 It's been tough for me. Cedarvale put new lanes in before PWBA event in August and they are still dialing in the league shot. Wednesday we finally had a little oil and shot 700.
7146 2018-09-28 22:48:39 I want to know what Flake got in return for selling sacred Native American Indian lands in Arizona real cheap to his oil and gas buddies.
7147 2018-09-28 22:48:36 Y’all a cop was behind me and I thought he was going to pull me over because I need to change my oil.....
7148 2018-09-28 22:48:33 Applied axe oil to head to ease the headache
Rubbed eyes afterwards

7160 2018-09-28 22:46:57 Why are oil changes so expensive 
7161 2018-09-28 22:46:56 
7162 2018-09-28 22:46:54 You know nothing of me. I make a living climbing abd cutting trees I use oil products every day. I just ask for true transparency. The resource extraction industry is subsidise the most. Of not I don't know cuz no transparency. Point me at the data. Don't just make claims.
7163 2018-09-28 22:46:44 Duped by Flake? LOL you got duped by the Republican Party who sold you snake oil when they told you they had resolve. Their arguments are cheap, and will be defeated by the true majority of the American People.
7164 2018-09-28 22:46:42 Are you aware exactly how much of the total budgetary expenditure the ABC and SBS take up? In comparison to other areas of expenditure? It's less than 1/10th of 1%, heard of the expression "chew gum and walk at the same time"? Subsidies to coal/oil industries, let's cut there 1st

7181 2018-09-28 22:43:19 But have you ever had truffle oil and parm cheese on your popcorn
7182 2018-09-28 22:43:19 BS. The nutrition lit is notoriously unable to control for multiple complex variables. So all you can really say is that there is anecdote regarding diet and inflammation. It will take decades to prove. 
Shame on an august university to pander to cranks and snake oil salesmen.
7183 2018-09-28 22:43:00 Man, I grew up hearing about the oil running out and the food running out and the teeming hoardes of breeders, never about Borlaug's triumph or the natural ubiquity of logistic curves.
7184 2018-09-28 22:42:54 estoy de acuerdo con Eva en que Maduro NO tiene que reunirse con el psicopata Trump que no es más que un mandadero de Corporaciones de Armas, Big Oil y Big Pharma
7185 2018-09-28 22:42:35 And I feel like the day went by so fast. It’s almost 6 and all we did was go to the doctor, chick fil a, and get an oil change wtf
7186 2018-09-28 22:42:13 When da weed man give u deal on oil 2 halfs for 25 yesss
7187 2018-09-28 22:42:05 I don’t watch network T.V. cuz of the agendas and the bias they push. The MSM has invaded every part of television. I always try to get an alternative form of news. I could use a few suggestions!!!!
7188 2018-09-28 22:42:01 Oil change and a bath for a car. It hasn’t taken a bath since 2017....I’m a bad car mommy lol
7189 2018-09-28 22:41:50 Grab a few toilet seat covers to cut up into 2-inch squares. These are great for soaking up excess oil on your face.
7190 2018-09-28 22:41:14 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
7191 2018-09-28 22:41:10 The big difference: Soros despises the USA
7192 2018-09-28 22:40:50 If you have tortillas and oil you can make them
7193 2018-09-28 22:40:49 IMO That won’t happen for a very long time as 1) the oil companies / insurance / maintenance industries won’t just roll over and let their income streams dissapear. If anything that’s one of the reasons what Electric cars are not mainstream enough yet.
7194 2018-09-28 22:40:35 Just cooked in coconut oil for the first time. Not bad!

Apply at night! Smells a little strong, I love it but the husband is not a fan of the scent
7223 2018-09-28 22:36:24 Oil/butter in coffee just wigs me out too much. :( But I know people love it.
7224 2018-09-28 22:36:20 It doesn't paint a pretty picture for oil IMO.
7225 2018-09-28 22:36:20 We use a transfat-free soybean oil.
7226 2018-09-28 22:36:09 I love when a get an oil change cause my car drives soooo smoooth
7227 2018-09-28 22:36:09 "data is the new oil" is just a myth big oil wants you to believe as they harvest your data in order to sell you more petroleum products
7228 2018-09-28 22:35:59 Yup
7229 2018-09-28 22:35:46 Rippin through old music to really feel something again is like getting an oil change for your car. It’s good for the soul

7233 2018-09-28 22:35:32 I feel like the one thing that would drastically improve my life is CBD oil but of course I have become so incredibly hypersensitive to everything that I can’t take it. 
7234 2018-09-28 22:35:32 peak liberalism is asking the consumer class to ‘go green’, recycle, and turn off their lights for an hour each year to save the planet instead of telling the agricultural/oil industry and multi-billion corporations to cut out 99% of the shit they’re pulling every single hour of

7241 2018-09-28 22:33:33 I need an oil change, my brakes fixed, AND I need my entire windshield replaced. I’m tired.
7242 2018-09-28 22:33:27 i just whipped up diy vapo-rub for my allergies with coconut oil and some essential oils i had on hand and why didn't i think of that sooner in these last hellish two weeks
7243 2018-09-28 22:33:05 how to grow longer hair

-coconut oil! it also works for eyelashes and eyebrows! 

-include lots of protein in your diet! (chicken, eggs, and greek yogurt are perfect !)

-potatoes!  using raw honey, egg yolk, and potato you can create a hair mask! 
7244 2018-09-28 22:32:54 Spent the whole afternoon looking for some coconut oil (to no avail) & buying Alice treats (because she didn't feel good last night), cleaning, & looking for some paint I bought a while ago so I can do art (didn't find that either)... & now I have no motivation to make dinner...
7245 2018-09-28 22:32:53 Target. I'm working on a rap right now about going that financial death trap for one thing and leaving with 27. I'm having writer's block though. What rhymes with essential oil diffuser?

7248 2018-09-28 22:32:37 Rising interest rates and oil prices could provide incentive for Trump to negotiate. Particularly, as Trump eyes 2020 re-election campaign: Economy will be of paramount importance.
7249 2018-09-28 22:32:18 I think my friends in Alberta would livery much like access to tide water so they can seek whichever market gives the best price. The Canadian east coast oil is lifted offshore and is sold at Brent price.

7267 2018-09-28 22:29:19 I'm still optimistic but it's like cruising 50mph cross the ocean and seeing the iridescence of oil on the crest of waves
7268 2018-09-28 22:29:14 Oil be blowed!!!!! Every day is a school day!!
Keep your  peeled on the small screen in the next few days for more info on this.
7269 2018-09-28 22:29:12 let’s hope my mom lets me take her car tomorrow bc my truck needs its oil filled and I can’t be bothered rn
7270 2018-09-28 22:29:11 Lmfao nah I’m just saying cause like those places are known for doing shitty oil changed and fucking up people’s shit, it only costs 30$ to do a simple oil change on a car with good oil that you know isn’t gonna fuck it up
7271 2018-09-28 22:29:10 Took my wife’s Toyota RAV 4 for  an oil change etc. for a 95,000  mile checkup and they tell me that there’s something wrong with the rotors & the other mechanic must have done a “Pad Slap” This is the 2nd time they have falsely said this. Said out tires were choppy. NOT! 
7272 2018-09-28 22:28:47 You dare to ask the question I've asked. Alas, there's no oil riches in Germany and no need for Fort Oil Interests there, so one human tragedy became another for generations and millions. But not for the psychopaths who find a cover for all their actions. They're doing fine.

7275 2018-09-28 22:28:28 shdjfnf i paid $25 for it so it better do its job and make my oily skin think it’s finally getting enough oil so it stops making oil (u know how confusing that is...hate skincare science dhdhdh)

7278 2018-09-28 22:28:21 I’m cool with it. We help those in need with gas and oil for the winter instead of buying crap we don’t need.

7286 2018-09-28 22:26:23 Washington reinforced its threats to impose a total embargo on Iran’s vital oil trade and cut Tehran off from the US-dominated international banking system. One could consider this to be an act of economic warfare pushing Iran towards further confrontation. -Finian Cunningham

7288 2018-09-28 22:26:16 Agreed I will not defend such silliness but I do know many people who cured cancer with THC and CBD oil
7289 2018-09-28 22:26:02 Reduce the size of government, cut back on spending might be starting points.  They could also work on getting Alberta natural resources to market - perhaps an alternate route to tidewater for oil ie. Churchill.
7290 2018-09-28 22:26:00 Ayyy $25 for a new tire and an oil change it’s lit shoutout the plug 
7291 2018-09-28 22:25:49 The reduction in capital expenditure in Canada has much to do with the mid-2014 decline in oil prices. OPEC says $1T in capex was lost globally. It has nothing to do with "Liberal policies" but with supply and demand. What will your argument be if Kitimat LNG is a go?

7293 2018-09-28 22:25:30 @elonmusk I have lived on a boat for many years and watched oil and fuel leaking in the marina daily from gas engines. Please sell Tesla  engines separate,so we can install them with a powerwall system/panels on boats. This would change the boating world and save the oceans.

7304 2018-09-28 22:24:04 ... and cod liver oil to know the difference.
7305 2018-09-28 22:23:54 Lmao so you didn't know? This was a common news. Give them 100million, ask them to return 70 and no records to trace it back to him. Oil was selling at 100+ per barrel, so the meagre 30% was used for salaries. No projects, no humab developments, nothing! Ko kwalbati!

7309 2018-09-28 22:23:09 Yes, and now there is little oil income times have certainly changed. You want a big change? To have your standard plummet? That’s what nationalists are working for. To impoverish us. God knows why, but it’s what they are doing.
7310 2018-09-28 22:23:09 Hedley? Don't get it. Probably the point.

How much money do you have riding on the oil industry?
7311 2018-09-28 22:23:08 Climate change? What’s that?  Said every greedy POS whose money is in the oil industry. 
7312 2018-09-28 22:22:53 Not only "big oil". I can imagine quite a number of different players that would be interested in controlling Tesla.
7313 2018-09-28 22:22:37 As someone who lives on the Gulf Coast & volunteered to patrol the shore for oil after DEH, this makes me furious!! Nearly ruined our environment, the seafood & tourist industry!!

Stop issuing oil drilling permits in Alaska until Kavanaugh is approved.
7385 2018-09-28 22:10:49 He still gets my vote. We have to pay taxes, what makes oil any different. Oil is bad for emissions.

7387 2018-09-28 22:10:37 Has oil and it's location is strategic, keep in mind Israel!3-there's a terrorist regime in Iran that want to extend it's ideaology and terrorist activities beyond the country borders as seen in Lebanon and Syria so there definitely should be two approaches in here

7395 2018-09-28 22:09:56 They don't care about truth. They have the same ethics as Greenpeace. (See Resolute Forest suit). Tides, @350 and Leadnow are the same. Their goal is not oil resources. It's to landlock Canadian oil period. They don't give a  about whales, coastlines or oceans. It's all about $
7396 2018-09-28 22:09:45 Lol.  Tar?  Tar is a organic substance derived from porus rock such as shale or limestone.  They aren't mining it in the oil sands region. 

Not sure what you are talking about.
7397 2018-09-28 22:09:43 Heard that
7398 2018-09-28 22:09:34 Agree. It's an absurd take.
7399 2018-09-28 22:09:16 My weekend not THAT exciting but I AM finally getting a haircut and the oil changed in my car 
7400 2018-09-28 22:08:50 They told me to keep at it over a period of weeks and not to let the stock oil dry. Set an alarm on your phone so that you don't leave it longer than an hour, less if the house is quote warm.

7405 2018-09-28 22:08:12 So my brother in law wanted to work on a project with me, and we accorded that for 10/20 years, I will be doing an oil painting a year, and the theme is roman mythology. So today I went to a book store and bought 3 books on mythology and roman legends! I'm super excited!!
7406 2018-09-28 22:08:08 Not really. Colonial past, followed by civil wars & dictatorships. Relgious & tribal feuds. Despite being a huge oil producer, majority lives in abject poverty, under a chronically corrupt leadership.

7424 2018-09-28 22:05:45 Interesting given the fact right after he met with them and sold them military equipment, prices started rising.

This is just another smoke screen by Trump

American oil companies need prices above $80 per barrel to make fracking profitable 

Don’t be fooled by this narrative

7434 2018-09-28 22:04:19 Extremely wrong as usual from you, read the work of Professor Ervand Abrahamian of CUNY, its an uncontroversial fact that the overthrow was at the behest of and in cooperation with British intelligence. You'll recall who had actual oil interests in Iran at the time.
7435 2018-09-28 22:04:12 I need to give most of them away. Have already made a hot sauce and a chili oil. Use them the flavor beans and other recipes.
7436 2018-09-28 22:04:08 And yes, palm oil is a much more healthier alternative to groundnut oil
7437 2018-09-28 22:04:01 Yes the oil..amazing healing powers....human nature to want to stay alive..only some of us will do all it takes to save our loved ones amd ourselves...laws ment to protect not kill

7440 2018-09-28 22:02:42 Plantlife = fundamental to ALL life on earth.  CO2 from vegetation and marine life becomes oil, natural gas and limestone, trapping it and eliminating it's CO2 from the life sustaining tropospheric cycle.  We dig it up and burn it... releasing it back to the life giving cycle.

7464 2018-09-28 21:59:04 Cool. That has nothing to do with oil and gas subsidy. 

Was the point of your original tweet to imply that without subsidies in the OandG industry it would fail? Or are you saying it shouldn’t be subsidized because of its GHG emissions?
7465 2018-09-28 21:58:58 Thanks man. Probably turmeric or Pau d’arco. Also big fan of black seed oil and oregano oil. Lemon water with ginger is a big one.

7488 2018-09-28 21:55:28 Oil price hit $82 per barrel. Very soon it would reach $100, and then we would see the magic @ProfOsinbajo would perform before May next year..

7492 2018-09-28 21:54:53 If you don’t put oil and salt on the outside of your baked potatoes before baking them.... you really ain’t doin it
7493 2018-09-28 21:54:48 Smfh that was because oil SPILLED and josh told me not to worry about it
7494 2018-09-28 21:54:48 Cool. I looked it up and proven reserves of u235 (76,000 tonnes) works out roughly as the energy equivalent of approximately 1.02 quadrillion barrels of oil. That's 11 thousand years of current oil consumption.
7495 2018-09-28 21:54:38 Oil is a finite commodity and with diminished amount of investment in exploration of new oil fields there will be tough times ahead for finding new oil
7496 2018-09-28 21:54:16 going to get my oil changed because of that tweet. u know what one i’m talking about.
7497 2018-09-28 21:53:38 Actually, I bet Food Networks dubs over a lot of commentary in post-production.

“It takes like dirt” becomes “earthy”
“It tastes like motor oil” becomes “unctuous”
7498 2018-09-28 21:53:23 The problem isnt giving the guy a chance. The problem is this contract restricts movement. Last year when brossoit sucked Oil put him on waivers to the ahl. Koskinen has more rights than that now and can simply if he chooses say no to the ahl and just make his money on the bench
7499 2018-09-28 21:53:16 There are so very many reasons not to go to Wawa, like soybean oil in their "lemonade". If you like their food, don't read the labels. The stuff is terrifying.
7500 2018-09-28 21:53:15 Yo no entiendo nada de fútbol pero fui a cargar gas oil y hay un cartel que dice que si vas con la camiseta de boca te siguen cargando
7501 2018-09-28 21:52:57 I forgot how good this oil smell
7502 2018-09-28 21:52:55 Plane crash kuma? 
7503 2018-09-28 21:52:47 We can't even process our own diamonds
I crude oil sizayi yenzani
China will milk us dry
7504 2018-09-28 21:52:16 About due for an oil change.
7505 2018-09-28 21:52:15 Olive oil mayonnaise 
7506 2018-09-28 21:52:03 Acá en Moreno una q era oil es puma ahora
7507 2018-09-28 21:51:52 Me too :). Thank you! 
PS Someone who had migraines said she tried "CBD" oil from hemp. To avoid drugs I found one with zero traces of THC ( Kats Naturals) and ordered a sample... but my bank put a stop on it until cleared with me :).  Will make note to let you know if it helps!!
7508 2018-09-28 21:51:21 Ok hold up hold my phone.... TRUFFLE OIL IS SO FIRE WHY DID I JUST NOW DISCOVER IT
7509 2018-09-28 21:51:08 Indeed oil in Iran has them gone crazy again. #BelieveChristine #AvnetReachFurther
7510 2018-09-28 21:51:02 Gold diggers digging till they find oil
7511 2018-09-28 21:50:47 Oh no, you got it all wrong, they'll play fair this time since we compromised
7512 2018-09-28 21:50:41 Echo chamber
7513 2018-09-28 21:50:23 Also page 7 on your link explicitly says the commodities in question are gold and oil and that bitcoin is NOT classified as a commodity as part of this case. This was not a crypto issue. It’s a decent size leap to take that this can lead to problems with other exchanges
7514 2018-09-28 21:49:47 Peak Oil is live until 4pm PST playing only the finest sounds on Tipping Point.  Lots of ambient, electronic, and overall sonic goodness coming your way...
7515 2018-09-28 21:49:47 Oil price up $82.77 per barrel. Naira still 310-345 to d dollar. Oil just <$30 off peak 'oil Boom era'.  Fuel still N145 per liter as against N87 per liter. I am not an economist but these were d numbers this admin used as their excuse for poor performance. It makes no comonsense
7516 2018-09-28 21:49:41 Just did my eyebrows, an aloe hair mask, a tea tree oil and honey face mask and i feel like a new person
7517 2018-09-28 21:49:40 Jilly has had her "bath" and is enjoying a beef bone her Daddy sent. I'm going to start using coconut oil on her skin and in her food, and the cats' food. #dogs #cats #coconutoil
7518 2018-09-28 21:49:23 Does anyone else think @lithiamotors service center needs some adjustment. Paid for lifetime oil changes and new heated seats. Won’t return my calls to get anything done on my truck.
7519 2018-09-28 21:49:23 Let the weekend begin!!! I'm hydrating and then I have to put away my groceries. I also took my pork shoulder chuncks out of the freezer to bake tomorrow. I'm gonna use my hickory/dijon/olive oil sauce mix and see how it goes.
7520 2018-09-28 21:49:14 I interpreted the tweet about sbsdzing oil and gas to mean that without it the oil and gas industry would sink. This of course isn’t true. What is true is that if green industry wasn’t subsidized it wouldn’t exist at all. Did I misinterpret the original tweet?
7521 2018-09-28 21:49:12 石油だってオリーブオイルだって牛脂だって仲間さ、そうだろう?
7522 2018-09-28 21:49:05 You Ain’t Said Nothing Slick 
To A Can Of Oil
7523 2018-09-28 21:48:44 Tech + oil drillers/service too.
7524 2018-09-28 21:48:35 Where was your outrage with Clinton’s rape cases, Hillary screaming “at this point what difference does it make?!”, your colleague lying about his Vietnam service, Keith Ellison’s abuse case. You are pathetic and a hypocrite...sell your snake oil to someone else
7525 2018-09-28 21:48:32 Can confirm
7526 2018-09-28 21:48:24 Nigerian food not allowed in santorini before you people mistakenly stain the walls with oil.
7527 2018-09-28 21:48:24 I can it for $1000 oil on 24x24 canvas
7528 2018-09-28 21:48:21 Bio oil is a godsend everyone should own some
7529 2018-09-28 21:48:15 And literally in almost every penny oil wise lol
7530 2018-09-28 21:48:00 Yea in Trumps head. Stop the greedy after their oil from a genocide. #BlockKavanaugh
7531 2018-09-28 21:47:51 Every time I see that.... person, I feel my right hand inching toward my pistol.
7532 2018-09-28 21:47:41 The Bush family always knew everything, RFK was after LBJ for Big Time GRAFT from Billy Sol Estes & Others. He was being pressured.

TEXAS BIG OIL George Bush, Murchison, & Hunt were threatened about special tax breaks on oil. Kennedy pressuring Bush...tax scam!
LBJ GOV Contracts
7533 2018-09-28 21:47:36 My wife’s cousin and her husband (from Alberta, Land-o-Oil) recently visited, and he’s angry about this climate change thing because if we believe and act on it we could wreck the lives of his kids and grandkids. Because they couldn’t work in extraction industries, I guess.
7534 2018-09-28 21:47:25 Lemme go oil my scalp and my hair then tie them up
7535 2018-09-28 21:46:55 He is trying to appease those baying  for blood with palm oil.
7536 2018-09-28 21:46:40 the stench of motor oil will not go away
7537 2018-09-28 21:46:28 I willingly got new tires AND an oil change today look at me world I’m fucking adulting
7538 2018-09-28 21:46:21 Damn right. At least you are smart enough to notice I dont give a f*ck. Elons burying the oil companies regardless if you like it or not. One day we will have clean air in the cities again. I'll be grateful when it happens even of I lose every dime I invested in said cause.
7539 2018-09-28 21:46:19 Try some: Passion Flower, Magnesium & CBD oil
7540 2018-09-28 21:46:18 @freewillforme where in Canada? I've been thinking about it also. United States is in term oil, our President is crazy
7541 2018-09-28 21:46:08 Coconut oil does not replace butter in baking. I don’t care what anyone says. I’ve tried it at least 10 times. The final product is always shitty.
7542 2018-09-28 21:45:57 *hands over baby oil
7543 2018-09-28 21:45:54 An oozing bottle of oil would make a better president than @realDonaldTrump
7544 2018-09-28 21:45:53 Would be great collectible...just sayin!!!
7545 2018-09-28 21:45:41 Does anyone know how to change oil ? Cause I’m pretty sure my car just shut off 
7546 2018-09-28 21:45:35 CBD pods exist. Not sure if you can just refill a juul with any CBD oil tho
7547 2018-09-28 21:45:33 Jesus...1000 horses at Modoc.They haven't rounded up that many at one time in years.They must really want this land for some reason. Cattle? Oil?Mining?

7549 2018-09-28 21:45:16 You don't need to copy their IP to make similar formulations.  Pure oil has only so many variants and if "safety" or potential for abuse is only consideration, then CBD w/THC <.01 is going to satisfy the requirement regardless if identical to epidiolex or merely similar.
7550 2018-09-28 21:45:15 I’m not that bullish on oil because of the marginal supplies that can come online - unless opec keeps cutting though.

I hope Uranium finally shines - I’m working on a big Uranium report & the data is very compelling. Finally the capitulation here since there are huge supply cuts
7551 2018-09-28 21:45:11 They have large supplies of midnight oil. Time to burn that!
7552 2018-09-28 21:45:05 Try Tea Tree Oil if you want to banish those blemishes!  It contains strong antibacterial properties known to reduce skin inflammation. It will dry out any whiteheads and pimples and disinfects your pores too! Say goodbye to your face demons and say hello to clear skin 
7553 2018-09-28 21:45:02 We gonna work on that bald spot TOGETHER! Get him a nice jumbo bottle of castor oil, fish oil tablets, and the Costco jar of biotin 
7554 2018-09-28 21:45:01 Drugs to treat an *addiction to drugs* are NOTHING MORE THAN SNAKE OIL. Period.
7555 2018-09-28 21:44:59 Listen...now's not the time to think. It's the time to do. Besides just drown your hair in almond oil. You'll be fine
7556 2018-09-28 21:44:16 Oil prices closed out on a high this week, with U.S. sanctions on Iran and fears of global supply shortages creating talk about the chance of $100 Brent

7557 2018-09-28 21:44:05 Since you had work done, it wouldn't hurt to check the oil level.  Otherwise, if the car is running & driving normally,  it should be safe to drive and get the codes read.
7558 2018-09-28 21:43:58 Hate getting oil changes 
7559 2018-09-28 21:43:58 France keeps more than 50% of @237online GDP, UK via NewAge sign gas oil deal, China donate billions of CFA as humanitarian aid for the #SouthernCameroon, US donate military equipment to fight Boko Haram in the far north which is now use to fight unarmed civilian in #Ambzonia

7564 2018-09-28 21:43:00 You have opinions; we all have them. However, the EU has said it will welcome Scotland. That's no suprise; given that Scotland is the largest oil producer in Europe.

7566 2018-09-28 21:42:29 Lucas oil is a half mile paved or dirt track? I know the drag track is there for the US nationals in NHRA..

7574 2018-09-28 21:41:33 Never date a girl who can't cook or a dude who can't change his own oil.

(Or, really, a dude who can't cook or a girl who can't at least change a flat tire)
7575 2018-09-28 21:41:20 You may write me down in history
With your bitter, twisted lies,
You may trod me in the very dirt
But still, like dust, I'll rise. 

Does my sassiness upset you?
Why are you beset with gloom?
’Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
Pumping in my living room.

7589 2018-09-28 21:39:49 The Indy roadcourse or Lucas oil raceway would be great for that normal Indy weekend
7590 2018-09-28 21:39:49 As a "greenie" I don't know what hypocrisy you're trying to blame on me, really.
It doesn't make sense to explore for more oil. There's a great documentary called #DoTheMath that explains why. Basically if we burn known reserves, our civilization dies, so what's the point of more
7591 2018-09-28 21:39:45 Welcome to the RED side
7592 2018-09-28 21:39:41 Not for me! My flu record is zero since the Hong Kong flu in the 60s. My strategy is vitamins and good food! Oregano oil is a also a great source!
7593 2018-09-28 21:39:34 I want an oil diffuser so bad
7594 2018-09-28 21:39:32 I am not a fan of groundnut or vegetable oil. Palm oil all the way.
7595 2018-09-28 21:39:16 How many times will republican party keep cowering down to the liberal crybabies?  I mean its always the squeaky wheel that gets the oil but this is ridiculous!

7599 2018-09-28 21:39:09 i know that feel :( oil is good!! but u should still listen to the dosage instructions since misusing it can actually prevent ur lil nose from healing or slow it down :< do u have a neti pot or something

"Hoy, somebody else got swallowed," a bearded man says, and you turn to see three ragged figures around a table, atop which rests a deck of cards and an oil lamp.

"Oh, good," another says. "Now we can play proper rummy."

7607 2018-09-28 21:38:23 All travelers must comply with federal law on transporting marijuana and cannabis infused products, such as CBD oil, on board a flight. Our officers are required to notify law enforcement if they discover these products during screening.
7608 2018-09-28 21:38:04 Why not present such a question to the governments and the oil companies which are investing billions of dollars in this technology? I can never get a straight answer from solar power doubters of whether China and Israel and @BP and @exxonmobil and @Shell are wise to invest so.
7609 2018-09-28 21:37:49 No. And since how many beers one has is now a valid issue to be looked at. We need to look into your history and that drunk driving thing, you know the one I'm talking about.

7613 2018-09-28 21:37:14 Wish he tried CBD oil. I have a colleague who had dx with cancer, began taking the oil liberally, and within short time, was pronounced cancer free! This likely but only one of several cures for cancer. I'm so upset with powers that be that are holding these truths from us.
7614 2018-09-28 21:37:12 In Lagos,we dont do the same thing the northern Hausa's do gaskiya.
7615 2018-09-28 21:37:04 There would be very little money for drilling oil and therefore little oil. As gold is essentially a finite resource the price needed to buy the method of exchange would have lead to the above and a crippling depression. Communists never did understand economics.

7634 2018-09-28 21:34:14 Our Liberal PM is trampling on indigenous constitutional rights to make sure we blow past our emission targets and sell more filthy oil

Oh and 40% of the pop is ruled by Rob ford's meaner brother
7635 2018-09-28 21:34:13 Empires crumble when their lifeblood is no longer viable. Oil is blood for the corrupt. Your veins are sick and your mind is ill. Trump's face will be imprinted into your brain and the rest of your days should be spent healing your rotting soul.
7636 2018-09-28 21:34:02 We have used it in our hair therapy oil.  I believe it can be used for the skin including face but I personally find it peppery.
7637 2018-09-28 21:33:59 ぐらぶるやってるひとオイラのぐらぶる垢ともつながってほしい
7638 2018-09-28 21:33:23 And someone that's challenging big oil, seeing record sales and has preorders for an all electric truck that would also destroy big oil and the diesel industry. Hence Ford's concept electric truck releasing. Too obvious.

7642 2018-09-28 21:33:13 Negative. Oil change is the "maintenance required" light.

7644 2018-09-28 21:33:07 Why do you love the oil and gas industry?
7645 2018-09-28 21:33:04 kanada, emptied of its minerals and dirty oil. emptied of its trees and water. a crippled thing, drowning in a puddle, covered in ants. the ocean doesn’t give a shit because it knows it’s dying too.
7646 2018-09-28 21:32:59 @sassielassie62 would LOVE your brand new Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil collection too! 
7647 2018-09-28 21:32:55 شكلي الوحيده اللي ما ناسبها الـ argan oil 
7648 2018-09-28 21:32:36 No. Oil change is the maintence needed light. Check engine light is a short in something, something loose, or a more serious issue.
7649 2018-09-28 21:32:31 No; you have assumptions. You have "feelings" and "suspicions," takes of oil wealth that somehow equals a nuclear program. If you cannot substantiate your feelings and suspicions with fact, then that is all you have.
You mistake a notorious liar's public statements with truth.
7650 2018-09-28 21:32:31 Tesla isn’t doing anything for the environment. Our grid is still highly carbonized and your solar panels are barely scratching the surface. Go nuclear, you snake oil salesman. Also, you are solely propped up by the government in case you forgot.
7651 2018-09-28 21:32:28 plain ol italian, little bit o oil
7652 2018-09-28 21:32:18 ﾊﾟだ！！！！！！！！
7653 2018-09-28 21:32:10 No doubt those in the oil delivery business are hoping you are right.

7657 2018-09-28 21:31:41 Apart from financial services whisky & a wee bit of crude oil, what do we have that the world wants?  Tories sold every feckin thing other than nhs & royal mint & they’re up for grabs to highest bidder now. C’mon Pete we need BMW’s & Audi’s more than they need cheddar cheese
7658 2018-09-28 21:31:34 Honestly speaking I met with lots of dudes their questions be like how can I date a Hausa Girls they gotta big nyash. My silly reply be like all u got to do is learn how to speak Hausa, and become a Muslim or else used your money to attract the fuck girls amongst them.
7659 2018-09-28 21:31:14 It is Coconut Oil
7660 2018-09-28 21:31:07  stop using the cooking oil. Get the factor 50 on.

7669 2018-09-28 21:30:02 Your crisis of conscience is...touching. Where was your conscience when Mr. Obama took 2 wars and turned them into 7? Where was it when Americans protecting their own water and land from big oil were treated like foreign combatants. Too little, too late, too convenient.
7670 2018-09-28 21:29:54 OPEC is ripping the world, and there is nothg you can do about it, it's time to take action and prove that America can do somethg abt them. The prices are at all time high and nobody seem to be interested in the talk of Donald trump to reduce the prices of oil. It's high tim

7682 2018-09-28 21:28:43 12th Finance Commission has recommended that the State of AP should get it's royalty for the oil refinery in KG basin.The BJP govt is not implementing this recommendation  #APDharmaporatam #CBNDharmaporatam #NRTDPUSA @timesofindia @TimesNow @republic @aajtak @BJP4India @GVLNRAO

7684 2018-09-28 21:28:35 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
7685 2018-09-28 21:28:14 It seems strange that the SEC would move against @elonmusk in this way, given that the Administration's mantra otherwise appears to be "deregulate at all costs".  I'm pretty sure I just heard Big Oil shouting, "sweep the leg!" from the sidelines.
7686 2018-09-28 21:28:11 Seems to be some double standards on that topic in the highest places of leadership these days.... we still dgaf. We want electric cars and we want the oil industry to fail. :shrugs:
7687 2018-09-28 21:28:03 So I lost my green silky,my blue brush,my new comb , my coconut oil and my headphones GREAT
7688 2018-09-28 21:27:43 Yep. We believe in it and the science. Also, our restaurant in Toronto is keto-friendly. Not fully keto, but easily keto, and we don't use inflammatory canola oil in our fryer.

7690 2018-09-28 21:27:38 It’s interesting that oil can get through but not germs. I’ll need to research this, I’m really intrigued.
7691 2018-09-28 21:27:31 My pic is timed and dated. No bull shit from me.
7692 2018-09-28 21:27:26 @RyanTheTwit Loved the newest #Galacticraft episode, and since you guys are still having power problems and need oil for your rockets, you should invest in farming canola to make oil.  Should keep you powered well until you can make nuclear generators

7702 2018-09-28 21:26:33 Why you got a pic of it leaving?

7710 2018-09-28 21:25:14 Totally. Oil sector investments routinely earn 25-40% returns, compensating for the huge commodity price risk they're taking. In regulated utilities (and to some extent in competitive markets), customers take the commodity price risk.

7715 2018-09-28 21:24:28 Love you Elon. The SEC is obviously being lobbied by big oil to take you down.
7716 2018-09-28 21:24:27 The key words are "limited in scope". A week is not enough time for the @FBI to do an intensive investigation which is what is needed to clear all parties. This is a sham and a snake oil saleman's deal!
7717 2018-09-28 21:24:24 Starting to think Maybe Chia has a no movement clause. I am not nearly as critical as a lot of Oil Twitter.. but that is an absurd contract, even for a year!
7718 2018-09-28 21:24:10 Yeah when I start working buckeye and making oil money
7719 2018-09-28 21:24:09 I met a Chinese PhD student working in a 35 million dollar lab in Edmonton (he took me there) and you know what he was working on? Oil sands reclamation, specifically water treatment. This was 9 years ago. The oil sands will be reclaimed, so relax a little, enjoy your life.
7720 2018-09-28 21:23:52 I can’t wait to see their reasoning on how increased tanker traffic carrying oil is bad and yet tanker traffic carrying LNG is somehow ok.
7721 2018-09-28 21:23:47 THC is oil though. Right?!?!
7722 2018-09-28 21:23:12 That is horrific arrogance in the face of little knowledge. "There's a lot of peat out there". That is like something Trump would say about coal or oil.
7723 2018-09-28 21:23:00 Haven't these sorts of claims about fish oil been debunked before?

7726 2018-09-28 21:22:37 Wait. Oil is the opposite of water. I'm a moron.
7727 2018-09-28 21:22:17 Craig, you keep posting stuff like this. How many times do I have to remind you? We were told in 2014 that was no oil and what was there was worthless. Surely there couldn’t be a mistake?

Enough time to build up the necessary infrastructure.
Instead,the upper class has just filled its pockets while the people are starving.
Stupid,depending on the export of raw materials+ still unable to promote+refine oil products.

7744 2018-09-28 21:19:45 Probably cause it wasn’t cooked well ? Best stew in the house and this is after all the bland normal oil stew the chef’s been making for years

7747 2018-09-28 21:19:21 Oil majors routinely commit billions of capex on the basis of highly volatile commodity prices. Sometimes that doesn't pay off, as is the case of most unconventional oil development pre 2014. But their shareholders bear all the risk.

7750 2018-09-28 21:18:32 I don’t like palm oil stew
7751 2018-09-28 21:18:01 Because most yorubas use it to make stew that would serve both purposes of soup nd stew..we just allow the palm oil to fry well nd almost turn to groundnut oil.
7752 2018-09-28 21:17:50 Sucks we broke the oil pump and damage the car a little. Hate starting so far back but we'll get 'em on Sunday! @allianceparts #BofAROVAL #NASCARPlayoffs #GoingFor2

7767 2018-09-28 21:15:49 I used to work in oil and gas reg; by law all oil and gas projects must be reclaimed. If you actually cared about the environment and habitat loss (you don’t) you’d protest farming, which has 1000x the impact on habitat loss AND not required to reclaim. Who’d grow your soy tho?
7768 2018-09-28 21:15:28 Thanks Blair. You know these paid activists don't really give a damn about orcas. They are just another tool to stop TMX along with fallacies about dilbit spills, "Dirty Oil", GHG Emissions, Energy Supply & Consumption, Water Protection, and anything else they can dream up.

Their oil has snake fat, allright, and won't kill those who drink it.  But will it cure acne and phthysis, as the travelling peddlers say?  We are still waiting to see..
7776 2018-09-28 21:13:54 If your skin is feeling extra dry use a body oil instead of a lotion.
7777 2018-09-28 21:13:44 Brought some Tea Tree Oil for my face, let’s hope it does wonders
7778 2018-09-28 21:13:23 No body is broke, depending on the position you are seeing it from. We all have a jar of oil like the widow( there must be something we have that God can use to bless us all)
7779 2018-09-28 21:13:19 The first part of your tweet would make a mighty fine oil painting
7780 2018-09-28 21:13:15 Not sure what remedy was for researcher but fermented seaweed tea with a little extra molybdenum not bad for foliar spray to get healthy bitter high oleocanthal oil that catches the throat.Maybe modern American lemon bred to taste too sweet....not healthy enough.
7781 2018-09-28 21:13:14 If we all agree that #lithiumIStheNEWoil, that #lithiumMINES and #cobaltMINES will supply the demand to make #EVbatteries and #POWERstorage, then the Great ones will skyrocket just like the big oil companies did historically.  History repeats itself.
7782 2018-09-28 21:12:58 Are you supposed to tip for car services like getting your oil changed
7783 2018-09-28 21:12:52 OMG girl! Slow down on the olive oil!
7784 2018-09-28 21:12:51 Why’s there always gotta be recommendations to be done when you go to an oil change spot? 
7785 2018-09-28 21:12:47 Because the taste is better . By the way, soya oil is healthier too but palm oil yum !
7786 2018-09-28 21:12:44 I must have missed that olive oil class
7787 2018-09-28 21:12:27 This oil my cousin made me is everything.. it define my curls so good 
7788 2018-09-28 21:12:09 Simply grilled, with lemon and a dash of olive oil.  Unfortunately, last week I was served grilled salmon on a bed of corn ... brrr ..., experience not to be repeated ...

7791 2018-09-28 21:11:55 Palm oil is best
7792 2018-09-28 21:11:46 Have you tried peppermint oil or applying salt to the wound?

P.S. bring fruit to the next stream, I think we're getting scurvy.
7793 2018-09-28 21:11:41 How did Obama do it? O poured on regulations, did war on coal and oil, forced health insurance on business, raised taxes, more dept. Obama's policies had 8 years of stagnation. Trump deregulated, opened up oil and coal, did tax cuts. In 2 yrs best economy ever. Conservatism works
7794 2018-09-28 21:11:36 Palm oil is healthier.

You're all welcome to join me, I'm happy to share. 

The fact that I'll be taking a giant rip right next to Trump Tower is just gravy.

7801 2018-09-28 21:11:03 @realDonaldTrump From November 4, the global financial system will be cut off on this regime, and Iran's oil exports will go down to zero, which means it can not export a barrel of oil. US secondary sanctions with all Power will be implemented

7814 2018-09-28 21:09:35 I'm not buying that example by the looks of it, as good as it sounds - evident oil leak, needs a new rear exhaust box and rear pads wearing thin.
7815 2018-09-28 21:09:31 Need oil or something or just habitual of things like today's sorts
7816 2018-09-28 21:09:21 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
7817 2018-09-28 21:09:13 食パンさんおはようございます！
7818 2018-09-28 21:08:59 Yeah, but the OIL'igarchs need their Saudi mammon, and Americans are blithely happy to turn a blind eye to such horror by filling up at the gas pump. 
7819 2018-09-28 21:08:53 Awww bless you. 

I made your chocolate olive oil cake today to help us raise a few hundred quid for McMillan Cancer btw.....don't forget what cooks can do beyond just a nice bite.
7820 2018-09-28 21:08:40 If a country is an oil exporter and oil is expensive the current account and the currency is strong. Therefore interest can stay low and consumers benefit. As Turkey is a net importer of oil, the currency collapsed, interests are sky high and the economy collapses.
7821 2018-09-28 21:08:25 Man I would love to oil that weapon 
7822 2018-09-28 21:08:22 Perfect time to short as more analysts coming out calling for $100 oil again
7823 2018-09-28 21:08:22 Sounds like the government of California.  colluding with the oil companies to increase profit for themselves.  no concern for climate change. personal profits are the only goals.

7832 2018-09-28 21:06:31 Fact! It is mainly used to further in the processed food market. That’s why you don’t see directly on the shelf. Please do your homework before you blindly follow smooth talking snake oil salesman.
7833 2018-09-28 21:06:30 Excellent Prof. Ashok Jhunjhunwala.What Prof says has to implemented by India on war footing. Each year India is made to pay 6-7 lakh cr for oil. Total tax collection is around 12 lakh cr only. It makes huge economic sense.Elect. can be from local thorium.India needs to shrug off

7849 2018-09-28 21:04:16 Electrolyte drinks are bullshit sugar water peddled  by modern day snake oil salesman.  I can get the same benefits from drinking water and eating healthy. Or in pinch drinking some pickle juice, with the added benefit of not being sugartastic.

7851 2018-09-28 21:04:08 Every single one of my residents want fried chicken, but management didn’t bring me oil or butter so I guess I’ll have to deal with behaviors and threats because they’re not getting fried chicken.

7866 2018-09-28 21:00:33 Whoa. You definitely wanna put 1-2 drops max of tea tree oil with a carrier oil like grapeseed, coconut, oil or jojoba. Tea tree oil alone strips the skin because it’s SO strong.

7876 2018-09-28 20:59:22 Well, that's why they are 'conservatives'. Changing anything threatens their privileged lives. They know they are old and calcified otherwise the oil industry would have invested in renewable energy instead of buying them out. Sclerosis of the brain.

And Mossadegh was not a socialist he was a feudal aristocrat who's grandfather's grandfather was the Shah. Nationalizing the oil meant keeping it in his hands not the khalq's.

7906 2018-09-28 20:54:58 There might be a better way. There arguably IS a better way. But the rules clearly say X, and the speedway is enforcing X. The fact the fanbase is breaking out the oil and pitchforks over the /speedway enforcing clearly stated rules/ is both sad and not surprising.

7964 2018-09-28 20:47:49 I don’t want any governor who blames price hikes on a man that has nothing to do with price hikes. 

Trade wars, oil manipulation by the GOP and president, and the disruption the GOP is costing in Americans is to blame, not Gavin Newsom.

So basically my determination to drive 4.5 hours each way Sunday to meet @trutriciahelfer saved my turn signal.

1) Take your vinyl of choice off the vertical stack located next to a radiator to preserve warmth. Extra points for obscure favs like DAMN
2) Take the record out, holding it by the playing surfaces. This massages oil into the grooves, creating more warmth
8014 2018-09-28 20:41:03 You still in on this?  I am but skeptical.  Figured with oil where it is we’d at least have ended green.

8076 2018-09-28 20:32:20 if you want it in a salad big tip is to put it in the bowl with the oil /dressing and literally massage it for 3 mins. Breaks the fibres / absorbs the flavours. Same effect as letting it cook for a long time
8077 2018-09-28 20:32:16 Lmao just bought a bag of those CBD oil lollipops they sell out of that weed truck. It’s been that kind of week. Will report back.
8078 2018-09-28 20:32:04 The point about WW2 that gets missed among the glory & stoicism is the fact that it was fucking awful, and for years after it ended. My dad was a child in the 40s and had to eat chips fried in whale oil. My mum experienced rationing in the 50s. Their early lives were shit.
8079 2018-09-28 20:31:57 FBI better be burning the midnight oil - starting NOW.
8080 2018-09-28 20:31:49 And on top of all the DEBT, DERIVATIVES and MONEY PRINTING is the soon popping of the Great U.S. Shale Oil Ponzi Scheme.  Once the world realizes U.S. Energy Independence was a pipe dream, then the Dollars will start to come home roost.

Now if only I stuck to that routine...

8101 2018-09-28 20:29:44 Are Oil based economies already going bankrupt?
I'm shocked to see #AsiaCup2018 runner ups Bangladesh getting a mere $50k and Winners India getting a paltry $100k as prize money. Surely they know there will be more than a 20-way distribution of this amount! Less Than $5k/man

8110 2018-09-28 20:29:04 Everybody looks at data differently, I'm thinking the left side is the truth and the right side is slicker than oil.

8119 2018-09-28 20:28:07 Which resources? If you're thinking of oil, eventually alternatives will become more cost effective and appealing. Well... so long as protectionist policies don't continue to block progress in that regard. But those will break one way or another if supply can't meet demand.

8125 2018-09-28 20:26:50 Adulting is hard. My battery died. Got it replaced. Got my oil changed. Took 3 hours from Walmart. I went on a quest to find a replacement nut to a part to keep my battery in place. Went to work and aired up my tires. Thank God for Brooke or else I would have lost my mind

8148 2018-09-28 20:23:20 The ME3 are not desperate enough to bargain fairly...yet. There’s no long term economic future in oil and the region is otherwise a sandpit wasteland run by plutocrats. Wind the clock and wait for fair terms. Never settle for anything less. #fairskies. #wearealpa @WeAreALPA

I gather you realize the propping up the U.S. economy since 2008, with Tens of Trillions of Debt and money printing was done so on the back of 5.5 mbd of Shale Oil Production.  Do you understand what happens when Shale goes down the toilet??  You aren't that naive?

8157 2018-09-28 20:22:01 Oil is a global market. Even if we become net exporters, the US will still pay the world price +/- freight & quality differences. Main benefit of energy independence thus not what we pay at the pump but the net impact on the economy of changes in the price of oil.

8165 2018-09-28 20:20:15 It’s an investment 

Not many can afford to invest in such things 

Also more importantly 
They need to turn oil money into something real ie not just a number on an account
That way in the future they can sell it for the new currency of the day
8166 2018-09-28 20:20:14 You can’t tell me not to juul in Whole Foods when they have those essential oil diffusers running in the bodycare section

8181 2018-09-28 20:18:57 I’m pretty sure the guy that pulled my car up after they were done with my oil change farted in my car...smelled like ass when I got in 
8182 2018-09-28 20:18:44 Oil change complete
8183 2018-09-28 20:18:40 Should only contain Bacitracin Zinc 400 units, 3.5 mg of Neomycin, Polymyxin B Sulfate 10,000 (5,000 units Polymyxin also works) in a base of white petrolatum and Mineral Oil. I saved the eyes of several cats w/very badly encrusted, infected eyes. They'd be blind today untreated

8186 2018-09-28 20:17:59 I smell so edible 

Imagine using this oil to take a bath 
Dessert is served 
8187 2018-09-28 20:17:56 My folks grew up in Guyana. My mom told us stories of the government mobilizing workers to spray pools with oil to counter a malaria epidemic when they were children. Hopefully the predators will get fat on them.
8188 2018-09-28 20:17:45 the oil feels like im rubbing cooking oil on my face nO joke????
8189 2018-09-28 20:17:45 Finally got my oil changed it was only 32 dollars
8190 2018-09-28 20:17:30 Not to mention.. I had to refill my oil every 1,000 so it was constantly running low.. BUT.. it taught me a valuable lesson in changing my oil in the future  in time and checking it regularly 
8191 2018-09-28 20:17:25 It’s coffee with fats in it! So coffee, MCT oil, real butter, heavy whipping cream, and I put Starbucks sugar free French vanilla flavoring in it! SO GOOD DUDE!!!!!

8193 2018-09-28 20:17:10 Talking from Spain: for my grandparents pasta was a modern thing (70's), and corn was just for feeding chickens. Bread & pulses were staples (post war diet), no cereal box for breakfast (bread or cookies with butter/oil instead). Lamb was the meat for any celebration.

8206 2018-09-28 20:15:18 If you’re as obsessed with cauliflower tots as I am, you need to get yourself an air fryer. Cuts the cooking time in half for a crunchy finish, no oil needed!
8207 2018-09-28 20:15:18 You should know you were hired because of your extensive knowledge of olive oil.
8208 2018-09-28 20:15:13 This vanilla oil @SandraGee gifted me is making me smell like cake I fucking love it! Thank you dear 

Y’all should patronize her for essential oils and other skincare products

8213 2018-09-28 20:15:05 The squeaky wheel gets the oil
8214 2018-09-28 20:15:03 Answer is yes on gas, but drilled down - repair, tires, gear, oil changes, accessories, insurance, will be more costly.  Getting tires changed (no repair but replacement if have a flat), regular maintenance way more costly.  Still there is nothing like riding a motorcycle.
8215 2018-09-28 20:15:00 I don't put creamer in oil.
8216 2018-09-28 20:14:41 Getting my oil changed so I can drive to @baltimorecomics on Sunday to meet Tricia Helfer. This Caprica Six/Lucifer fan is really excited. #BattlestarGalactica #LuciferOnNetflix @LuciferonFOX #SciFiFri #baltimorecomiccon
8217 2018-09-28 20:14:37 You must have read Madam Ngozi's book on fighting corruption is dangerous, she noted that recession is inevitable with the way GEJ squandered all we had despite the high price of oil during his tenure also his govt enriched people like you not the masses.
8218 2018-09-28 20:14:31 Get the generic -name brands contain other ingred. like Cocoa Butter, Cottonseed Oil, Olive Oil, Sodium Pyruvate-read the package ingredients
8219 2018-09-28 20:14:27 education, olive oil, easy mistake
8220 2018-09-28 20:14:17 While we agree on the lousy EIA Forecasts of just about everything, the critical factor in future solar power manufacture, hence, solar generation, is based on the burning of PHAT amount of fossil fuels.  When the U.S. Shale Oil Ponzi Pops, it's game over for U.S. Solar.
8221 2018-09-28 20:14:03 Oh shit! Not more oil.. Do you think the cost of our fuel will go down?

8226 2018-09-28 20:12:32 How about our cheap oil we are shipping you? Is that a bad deal too?
8227 2018-09-28 20:12:26 What is outrageous is that you repeatedly fail to acknowledge what is universally known; that Berman was included at the INSISTENCE of the oil producers involved, in an effort to show that they believe that even the most vocal dissenting opinion might have valid points to make.

8230 2018-09-28 20:12:14 The reviews are super mixed. A lot of people didn’t realize the oil/moisturizer was an important step so they did a normal routine lol. Some people have done second tries after the brand owner released an application video
8231 2018-09-28 20:12:00 Unlike the European leaders who embrace the Moolas for their cheap oil, you are telling the truth. Thank you Mr. Secretary.
8232 2018-09-28 20:11:56 There's no oil without squeezing the olives. No wine without pressing the grapes. No fragrance without crushing the flower. So when you are pressed, God us bringing out the best.

#ALDUBNationWalangIwanan
8233 2018-09-28 20:11:49 By filling your tank with E30 you are reducing American dependence on foreign oil. The corn used to produce the #ethanol in E30 is grown by #localfarmers right here in northwest Missouri.
8234 2018-09-28 20:11:43 Love when I get my paycheck and it instantly goes all away bc of smog checks and oil changes and tuition and parking tickets 
8235 2018-09-28 20:11:07 Venezuela’s interests were too tied up in oil and their current president ousted their actually socialist previous president. The Nordic states may also have private industry, but that doesn’t mean their social programs don’t greatly increase quality of life
8236 2018-09-28 20:11:03 Cut out all the animal products.
We don't need them, and they contribute heavily towards obesity

I make, curry, chilli, lasagna, shepherds pie etc, all plant based, no cooking oil. Great tasting food.
8237 2018-09-28 20:10:42 The craving is getting worse I.... want a well marinated chicken legs, fried with vegetables oil, crispy from out side tender and supple from the inside, french fries, ketchup and sour cream on the side...

8243 2018-09-28 20:10:05 In 1988, I was accused of Rape by my X-wife. It turned out I was working night shift at a oil refinery at the time of the alleged attack. Needless to say I was traumatized by this attack. Therefor I believe investigation is needed of Supreme Court nominee !!
8244 2018-09-28 20:10:05 Man, I’m so irresponsible about my car. Literally THE ONLY thing I do on time is oil changes. Literally.

8249 2018-09-28 20:09:28 So no industry should be regulated by people outside the industry? That includes oil and gas and coal? Arguing that only restaurant owners should get a say is not how any regulation works or has ever worked. And PLEASE stop calling those of us who voted YES "stupid" or "tricked"

8264 2018-09-28 20:07:31 What does that mean to “love” a state? One loves the demographical borders? One loves the fauna and flora? The ethnic, soicial, and political diversity? The history of having been snatched from the Mexico? The oil refineries?  Is it better than other states? What does this mean?

8267 2018-09-28 20:07:06 Ahhh. That makes sense, probably should have paid more attention to your video

Thanks Kae you’re a c60 knowledge treasure.

I wonder if putting it in a jar & evaporating off the ethanol would also settle out most of the c60, so I can drain off the flax oil. Off to experiment.

8286 2018-09-28 20:04:21 I’m feeling like $77 is the magic number - high enough to spur on more LNG investment and keep Permian drilling going ... but not so high that people are squawking about $100 oil.
8287 2018-09-28 20:04:00 You just made my Friday big guy, have a great weekend!  I am with you we are getting close but still not ruling out the possibility of seeing 3.25% in 10s.  My concern is oil.

8290 2018-09-28 20:03:43 2 hours for an oil change and tire rotation is a bit extreme

8300 2018-09-28 20:02:25 That is ur view. We have NOTHING to plunder in Kashmir. Thr is no OIL, no GOLD, no MINERALS in Kashmir. India puts in more money into Kashmir by many times over than it ever gets in return. Look into ur history n how u captured the independent state of Kalat (Balochistan).
8301 2018-09-28 20:02:25 You’ve read more history than me, but I think you may be attributing violence to the wrong side. Their rise to power, by means of violence, was a backlash against gentle requests to do the right thing. Remove them from power by disbanding the oil companies that sponsored them.
8302 2018-09-28 20:02:15 Increase cell turnover, increase production of collagen and it helps with your skin texture overall. You’ll feel soft and smooth afterwards.

8332 2018-09-28 19:57:57 My problem with better help is that they're selling help to people that actually really need it then reject them it's basically snake oil

8341 2018-09-28 19:56:55 Well they just moved CBD oil with less than 0.1 of THC to schedule 5 drug list which means it can be prescribed by an MD so that a pharmaceutical company can sell it's new seizure medication for intractable seizures.

8360 2018-09-28 19:55:06 @cbarghout Hi Caroline. Just wondering how railway reconstruction to Churchill is going. I think it's got super potential. Why not ship oil through there? Thanks  from a fellow journalist that just happens to be interested in Churchill.
8361 2018-09-28 19:55:04 You mean that document written by dead white European slaveholding cishet shitlords? That thing is so 18th century! /sarcasm
8362 2018-09-28 19:55:01 At the dealership for regular car maintenance — oil change & tire rotation — and advisor told me someone had cross-threaded a lug nut & broken a stud on one of my tires. This has to be a metaphor for something. 
8363 2018-09-28 19:54:51 Maybe they know better. They already have enough oil in their engines. Don’t need any more
8364 2018-09-28 19:54:32 Jesus... why not just take cbd oil at that point...

8368 2018-09-28 19:54:13 Other than this communications from Middle East, US, Canada and UK were being monitored. I witnessed a meekly ‘Spice Board of India’ office frequented by a Saudi cooking oil factory workers, all from Karachi. Spice board was a RAW den and moved when exposed.

8401 2018-09-28 19:50:08 ya but banning more tankers won't hurt? will it ? false premise on your "oil paid for salary" keith - we all know you're partially paid by the oil industry and you're HQs are in Alberta - pffft fake newser
8402 2018-09-28 19:50:01 I won't give up. I still reach out. They seem to view me as the devil incarnate. I see them as ppl who have struggled then been hoodwinked by snake oil salesmen. It's like they're in a cult.
8403 2018-09-28 19:50:01 Even Dad thought what he told me was weird. And, he overcharged me of an oil change. I've never paid over $100 at the dealer. So, I learned a lesson. 1. go with my gut always. 2. don't listen to Dad.

8429 2018-09-28 19:45:20 The only thing i disagree with is the term, mob". implies, IMO, large group. These people resisting aren't large, just loud. its the squeaky wheel - gets oil. Republicans need to replace these broken wheels.

8434 2018-09-28 19:44:46 Managers of oil companies attracted criminal structures to solve financial problems. Together they worked out a number of schemes when profit from oil selling was placed into personal bank accounts of companies' management.

8440 2018-09-28 19:43:53 Since the beginning of the 90s, political and financial structures started struggling for oil fields in the Tyumen region with the intention to gain control over the oil industry in the region. Most oil companies did not have resources to buy new equipment or to pay wages.
8441 2018-09-28 19:43:43 BTW the argument was that the middle class are running - Toronto average wage is 66 000 which means that mortgage payment is their entire pay.  You might want to worry about Alberta and not Toronto - Oil Sands are dead

8487 2018-09-28 19:37:20 As a matter of fact, I do — but more importantly, engineers for dozens of countries and hundreds of companies (including many of the big oil companies) know this, and are investing heavily in solar. But please, explain to @BP_plc and @exxonmobil and @Shell that they’re mistaken.
8488 2018-09-28 19:37:08 @JeffFlake Thank you Senator. It took courage to do what you knew was right when so many of your "friends" are pressuring you.  History will judge your act today kindly when those look up at your oil painting.  A week investigation is the fair thing to do
8489 2018-09-28 19:36:56 You’re a snake oil salesman trading in faux Christian rhetoric & praying on peoples fears. We see you’
8490 2018-09-28 19:36:54 Having just read this I can confirm... nothing in it is evidence that we invaded Iraq for oil. It does describe how oil is important for stability. This is part of a strategic consideration. If we are to invade Iraq we want it to be stable.
8491 2018-09-28 19:36:47 We are children of the light so when a thief comes at night to those in the dark, we won’t be caught off guard, because we are watching the signs/seasons.
Mollie’s pastor is teaching what is in the Bible. We need to have oil in our lamps and be ready for the wedding feast
8492 2018-09-28 19:36:31 Scheduling an oil change for my car ‘okay we have you scheduled for an oil change on the Lexus today @ 1.’ First off, my name is Lexis not my car. Second off, it’s Friday I get it 
8493 2018-09-28 19:36:19 Money managers have cut their bullish Nymex WTI crude oil bets by 965 net-long positions to 332,143, weekly CFTC data on futures and options show.

8494 2018-09-28 19:36:10 Damn I gotta do an oil change, car wash, and bumper replacement. And I just paid $200 insurance. Rip my fucking wallet.
8495 2018-09-28 19:36:08 Kuna tafiti zitasema oil na grease ndio salama zaidi
8496 2018-09-28 19:35:55 Ah damn. Even if by some chance it dry me out I use stuff under it like farsali 24k oil or something  I don’t know many other brands that get the shades right and is radiant
8497 2018-09-28 19:35:53 Had to get a oil change and a wheel alignment and got the bill  tf did yal do?
8498 2018-09-28 19:35:44 She doesn't have OIL EITHER!
8499 2018-09-28 19:35:34 Haha it's like 14 years old. That's just.. never happened before, and certainly not this far within the last oil change's mileage, which makes me worry.
8500 2018-09-28 19:35:25 tea tree oil diluted if u sensitive.
8501 2018-09-28 19:34:32 That's what you should be grateful about. Pr. Trump only cares about Americans. But, at the same time his foreign policy is in benefit of humanity. Of course he does not care about us and he should not be. The oil thing is a joke and you know it.
8502 2018-09-28 19:34:32 Crostini....with rapeseed cold pressed oil and some cured meats yuuuum
8503 2018-09-28 19:34:25 Its called giving them something and getting nothing.  Republicans are good at that
8504 2018-09-28 19:34:24 They don't have OIL, DUH...
8505 2018-09-28 19:34:15 Medical cannabis oil should be available to everyone

8508 2018-09-28 19:33:39 Went to get an oil change, need new tires and now my car won’t start  wow wow wow
8509 2018-09-28 19:33:37 You don't sacrifice human dignity for some palm oil or animals. You just don't. I am a animal lover & I want all animals to live nicely & comfortably & I don't want to destroy the rain forests, but I am not about to starve humans to save the rain forest. Should be commonsense.
8510 2018-09-28 19:33:35 When are y’all gonna quit lying about coconut oil
8511 2018-09-28 19:33:29 Happy birthday Daddy. God used you to change our lives and bless this generation. May your oil never run dry and May God’s anointing  on you continue to increase.
8512 2018-09-28 19:33:18 Indulgences from the pizza gods can be bought with enough quality pork products, good olive oil, and if needed a Mozzarella di Buffala bribe
8513 2018-09-28 19:33:10 check out 2007-2008, oil can as easily go to 140 as to 25. or both in one year.
8514 2018-09-28 19:33:06 When you add it to the oil, use a wide mouth jar/beaker and let it evaporate off overnight (cover it with cheesecloth if necessary).  Once the smell of alcohol goes away, then stir.

As for bad batch - if the oil went rancid, throw it away.  No way to recover.
8515 2018-09-28 19:33:03 Lol krill oil. No bro.
8516 2018-09-28 19:32:58 I’m not saying no one’s tracking gold flows, or even few.  I agree many are.  IMO few are considering the gold flows in context of global sov debt bubble, Multi currency oil, trade war, etc
8517 2018-09-28 19:32:44 I hope they have you wear your tights.. and Oil up before the wedding
8518 2018-09-28 19:32:37 P.S. Imagine the outrage from democrats if a GOP Governor in Utah was bragging that by the end of the year the Utah Dept of Natural Resources will have sold two oil and gas sales within the Dixie National Forest and Fishlake National Forest. #KeepItPublic #MTPol #MTNews #MTMedia
8519 2018-09-28 19:32:35 I should be a responsible adult and go get the oil in my car changed. If only being idle for the rest of today didn't seem like the more appealing option.
8520 2018-09-28 19:32:35 I HATE getting my oil changed. I know nothing about cars and despite telling myself every time that I won’t be upsold... I always get upsold.
8521 2018-09-28 19:32:23 Driven to the airport with a lifetime supply of coconut oil
8522 2018-09-28 19:32:09 Just checking in to say last night my car dash blinked the oil canister at me and the manual was like "yeah stop driving right now." I put more oil in it and the light's gone but I wasn't due for an oil change for another 1k miles so uhhhhhh
8523 2018-09-28 19:32:02 Fish oil is so 2012. Krill oil all the way, baby.
8524 2018-09-28 19:31:53 Have fun at the range, ladies. Me and the boys will pick up some marshmallows, pretzels and beer. We'll keep the fire going for when y'all get back.
8525 2018-09-28 19:31:50 #koeksusters are so named because the cake is fried and the oil makes a hissing sound”sus”. Nothing to do with sisters. @BritishBakeOff
8526 2018-09-28 19:31:18 Umm. No.

The mid-East had oil. Not coal or gas. 

But now US has those in abundance too due to fracking. 

And the mid-East influence is waning away as their ability to blackmail folks dies out.
8527 2018-09-28 19:31:01 @RedlerAllAccess $XLE still fine to sit in, looks like oil going nuts?
8528 2018-09-28 19:30:55 Now that I can breathe for a few days, I really am going to mostly disconnect. I'm going to drive through 2 National Monuments and a National Park in my stunningly beautiful state before they're turned into oil rigs and strip mines. I'll be back with pictures.
8529 2018-09-28 19:30:51 I be having to put oil on my edges DAILY
8530 2018-09-28 19:30:47 Maroon was brought in to be used in the exact role he was used in. Rattie was AHL depth, two completely different animals.
8531 2018-09-28 19:30:34 Let us all trust a judge who cant keep his composure to run the highest court in the land. Makes as much sense as an oil guy running energy dept. Ass backwards
8532 2018-09-28 19:30:33 On reflection, our leaders have proved once more that they are not good for us. Oil was at nearly $140/barrel in 2007/8 or there about and we were told economies would be made resilient  #oilandgas #oilprice #Government
8533 2018-09-28 19:30:33 My hair eats grease/oil right up
8534 2018-09-28 19:30:20 sama teh, skrg nambahin minyak zaitun sbg face oil cuci muka. Jd lembutan euy 
8535 2018-09-28 19:30:09 Oil
8536 2018-09-28 19:30:05 Why single out "junk food"? On Masterchef they regularly tip half a bottle of oil and a gigantic knob of butter into a sauce, which adds thousands of empty calories... surely this is worse than eating a 500kcal cheeseburger, yet nobody vilifies Michelin star cooking.
8537 2018-09-28 19:29:29 .@PopeyesChicken y’all hiring petroleum engineers? I know y’all use oil to fry that chicken
8538 2018-09-28 19:29:11 Good thing I only drink motor oil
8539 2018-09-28 19:29:09 Eto ang hindi sinasabi ng Dilawan. May automatic oil suspension ang TRAIN Law at $80 pero sinisiraan pa din nila
8540 2018-09-28 19:28:56 Could I ask what MLMs are and if (CBD) cannabis oil is okay? I've got some from when my grandad had cancer and I've used it a few times.
8541 2018-09-28 19:28:50 He then got my breaks,oil change and brand new tires,Come over to cut my grass and take my trash out 
8542 2018-09-28 19:28:45 Both. It has argan oil in it but I use coconut oil in his hair
8543 2018-09-28 19:28:42 firm tofu, black salt, black pepper, spinach or kale, shallot, tomatoes, almond milk, nutritional yeast, paprika, green onion, vegan butter or oil.
8544 2018-09-28 19:28:34 88% of gas is exported while oil and gas uses the front range for an unhinged industry to destroy our way of life. Who’s listening now? Interesting how we weren’t heard for years and years and now all of the sudden we are being blamed. #shameonoilandgas
8545 2018-09-28 19:28:33 If oil and water don’t mix, being messy and anointed won’t either.
8546 2018-09-28 19:27:39 PC gets full props for Maroon acquisition but not for Rattie,alright then, not sure if there’s a big difference...
8547 2018-09-28 19:27:11 We aren't addicted to #oil, but our #cars are. - James Woolsey
8548 2018-09-28 19:27:03 Oil rises as U.S. sanctions on Iran tighten supply: Oil prices rose on Friday as U.S. sanctions on Tehran squeezed Iranian crude exports, tightening supply even as other key exporters increased production.
8549 2018-09-28 19:26:45 Anyone else notice Senator Flake calling for the delay....then BOOM, Grassley pulls the two-hour "we're adjourned" rule ?

Does anyone else find that a bit shady? I sure did. Immediately. 
They're slick about it. 
As slick as a tanker oil spill. I don't buy it. 
8550 2018-09-28 19:26:42 For the record, flax seed oil is not a good oil for C60.
8551 2018-09-28 19:26:24 I joined a number of years ago but hated it for many reasons, not the least of which was why should I make that little snot even richer. When FB censored my links to the Deepwater Horizon oil well disaster in the Gulf, that was it for me. Deleted my account & never went back.
8552 2018-09-28 19:26:07 So Kukes probably dealt with Mikhail Fridman, German Khan, Alexei Kuzmichov, Alexander Kushev and other Alfa Group partners. AG has stakes in TNK-BP, formed in 2003 following merger of BP's RU oil/gas assets & oil/gas assets of Alfa Group, Access Industries and Renova Group.
8553 2018-09-28 19:26:07 @FordService So I have a question about tires you purchase from Hankook Tire manufacturing in Clarksville. Nobody there is I.S.O. certified in temperature, scales, or oil & vibration analysis. How do you certify I.S.O. standards?
8554 2018-09-28 19:25:57 Venzuela is one of the richest nations in the world.

It has oil, gold, abundant nature and a number of other resources.

When well managed it could be one of the wealthiest nations of the world.

8563 2018-09-28 19:24:25 You should be doing it at about 5000 miles or when you get your oil changed to prolong the life of your tires aha
8564 2018-09-28 19:24:10 If you think Trump cares about Iranians, you are sadly mistaken. Rethugs want Iran’s oil and could careless about human rights!

8572 2018-09-28 19:22:06 Good Lord. I wondered why on #crackyourbible's episode about drug use, I've recently been spammed with comments about cannabis oil benefits. I had no idea that the legions of #MLM crazies are now on YouTube comments. 

FYI, MLMs are not kingdom jobs, they're a secular cult, fam!

8576 2018-09-28 19:21:31 Lol and that negates him being the first person in history to stand up to big oil? Dude is more scrutinized by the media and held to a higher standard than anyone on the planet right now. Because powerful people are heavily invested in fossil fuel and badly need him to fail.
8577 2018-09-28 19:21:27 I just did my oil change not more than 2 months ago and I gotta do it again already 
8578 2018-09-28 19:21:07 Then stop using companies that use palm oil. And stop putting plastic micro beads in toothpaste it's polluting our oceans!
8579 2018-09-28 19:20:44 Eating avocados and coconut oil all day? Probably not the best nutrition wise

8583 2018-09-28 19:20:23 When half of your committee requests the appointment, you don’t tell them to take a hike. Well, we know Kenney would but Notley’s working with the oil industry; not against them. #abpoli #ableg

8585 2018-09-28 19:20:14 Yeah because all the dirty oil burnings shit boxes of the 90s were gone and we built better running cars. Cars have been getting cleaner every year. Old polluters get scrapped. Thats what caused the reduction

8595 2018-09-28 19:18:38 Delaying my oil change until Congress can confirm that I really need High Milage 10w-30 - should take about a week. Trying not to flake out.
8596 2018-09-28 19:18:34 I got the right chap for the job - @LtHarryStocracy. Oil & Canvas maestro. You should check him out, Dan. (Being serious I am).
8597 2018-09-28 19:18:26 Is that some kind of an oil? 
8598 2018-09-28 19:18:22 When they say fat&oil, they mean pork meat.

Oh wait there's no Tesla without Elon. Didn't make it through adversity.
That's what auto and oil want to achieve I believe
8600 2018-09-28 19:18:12 I still have my Yamaha. The horn I got in college ^^

Used it on a track or two including “oil on my lips” by my band Look Left.
8601 2018-09-28 19:18:03 Ah yes? I find her sausages very greasy and non tasty. Cooking beans in stock is a good idea - might try black eye or butter bean, It's common in Greece, with olive oil and herbs; I had it in Crete many times.
8602 2018-09-28 19:18:02 I’ve had bad breakouts for the past 6 months or so and literally had perfect skin before, and idk your skin type or what you’ve tried but I’ve started trying more natural things, so I moisturise my face with jojoba oil (I have really try skin tho) and then I put tea tree oil -
8603 2018-09-28 19:17:55 He’s a wimp.  A big wimp who thinks he is “healing” the nation.  This is no profile in courage.  He’s a wimp who is pouring oil over a slippery slope
8604 2018-09-28 19:17:41 Then you can look it up today but the  People of Iraq own the oil fields.
8605 2018-09-28 19:17:40 Pretty bang on. Not as hyped on CAR as you, could see NJD in that spot. The Oil better grab at least that last spot!
8606 2018-09-28 19:17:25 No, while many would love the idea politically to break from the other side the bigger picture when considering industry, resources, economics makes it impossible. One side risks losing tech and financial industry. The other oil, agriculture, access to the gulf etc etc.
8607 2018-09-28 19:17:24 Chef Louis cut up some carrots, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was chicken, along with gravy.
8608 2018-09-28 19:17:10 Get herbs & roots like pine oil& turmeric& use them instead or better yet arsenic (sarcasm).
8609 2018-09-28 19:17:10 Who is defending those oil execs? Maybe they were naive, but the NDP knew exactly what Berman stood for since they are fellow travellers. And it was the govt that signed the appointment order. Govt ultimately responsible.
8610 2018-09-28 19:17:07 Oil change, new license plate sticker, new transmission, new tires, and fixing my cracked windshield. Not to mention I’m paying my carnote n rent today. That’s like s stack outta my pocket, I’m feeling some type of way now

I wish I could mind-control the banks, and focus the margin calls on funds trading equities.  :) 

The squeeze can show up any of the risk assets. SPX looks like a easier target today, than crude oil, for example.

8626 2018-09-28 19:15:03 Oil from vitamin E capsules is good
8627 2018-09-28 19:14:59 The burden of proof is on you.  You're making an accusation we went in for oil but there is literally no evidence of that. You're just repeating talking points and propaganda.
8628 2018-09-28 19:14:50 Did an oil change today, puttin on new brakes tomorrow.... Road trip to Florida next week!!!!!
8629 2018-09-28 19:14:35 Sure but let's start with clawing back all the wealth collected by billionaires  owners  of oil and gas and coal companies. And more importantly bring down the American empire which is needs the petrodollar to sustain the empire.

8632 2018-09-28 19:14:08 when will my stomach not be so sensitive like a bitch cant even digest grease/oil why my body hate me
8633 2018-09-28 19:14:07 Because the oil industry invited her. Because the Alberta oil industry is trying to work with environmental considerations not against them.
8634 2018-09-28 19:13:50 My friend said i might be able to vape cannabis oil and not have an asthma attack, and tbh that would be really nice because maybe a hit or two would help with my constant anxiety because the escitalopram isn't as much.
8635 2018-09-28 19:13:44 Dude it's just fish oil
8636 2018-09-28 19:13:44 Ya bitch just changed the oil on Arics bike haaaaaa
8637 2018-09-28 19:13:43 We don’t mind going back to that time, either. Maybe we weren’t money wealthy, but we were and we remain wealthy in dignity,culture,and unity. Things you can’t comprehend. Oil changed nothing, we maintain traditions and remained humble albeit our stray cats eat better than you.

8645 2018-09-28 19:12:52 You know oil industry execs began meeting with Berman and other NGOs back in 2014. You could probably blame that on Notley too if you think it will help but it’s actually because the Alberta oil industry is trying to work with environmental considerations not against them.
8646 2018-09-28 19:12:52 Agreed. Gordon Ramsay is gonna fight her for wasting good olive oil.
8647 2018-09-28 19:12:49 Scotland will have it if it is independent but at the moment it's UK oil.
8648 2018-09-28 19:12:43 Yes for reals! The irony is, I was literally coming home from town, where my car had just been washed, vacuumed and had an oil change.
8649 2018-09-28 19:12:31 When I got to the point where d idiot said she has an aunt in Abuja, who works with an oil company, but can't remember the name of the company. Gbam! I knew lightning had struck. 45k... I. D. I.  O.  T. A!!!!!

8655 2018-09-28 19:11:40 Well newborns. I don't remember when I started the oil. Probably 2 bcz I remember in Europe I saw a dermatologist for my eldest daughter.
8656 2018-09-28 19:11:16 Not to mention the fact that the oil tankers will be towed in and out by tugboat and tbe restricted to very low speeds. A rowboat could easily get out of the way.
8657 2018-09-28 19:11:13 I told Kenyans severally for safety of your vehicle, always fuel at government controlled petrol stations- National oil corporation. Shifted many years now at peace.
8658 2018-09-28 19:11:10 Ooooooh will check. I use a lot of argon oil in my hair.
8659 2018-09-28 19:11:09 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
8660 2018-09-28 19:11:06 Also you can get digize - an essential oil mix or peppermint oil to rub on your stomach. Probiotics can also help rebalance your digestive system to kinda help too!! I hope you feel some relief soon 
8661 2018-09-28 19:11:02 Not for me. They use palm oil in their products that contribute to the destruction of rain forests and habitats of endangered species. Pass.

8665 2018-09-28 19:10:37 I bought an oil diffuser to help combat my allergies and headache and let me tell you this thing is already working better than any medicine I have tried thus far 
8666 2018-09-28 19:10:34 Idk how much sun you get but if it’s not a lot, I highly reccomend baby oil gel, and argan oil. A little goes a loooooong way after a shower. Sadly I have zero reccomendations for people who actually step outside in the daytime

8670 2018-09-28 19:10:16 You have no evidence we invaded Iraq for oil. Just because Illegal chemical weapons were not found does not mean we went to Iraq for oil. 

We are America. We don't need to invade countries for oil.
8671 2018-09-28 19:10:15 I’d recommend making my sugar cookies instead, since liquid oil and butter don’t behave like coconut oil.

8678 2018-09-28 19:09:33 I'm sure your heart is in the right place cuz you just don't know what beto says is garbage. 

I'm Texan,  I know exactly what happened when oil prices dropped to $20 bbl. 

I do support Texas 100% and I know bs when I see it, especially in the oil market.  You're being played
8679 2018-09-28 19:09:25 Yes, we invaded Iraq. But not for oil. That is a complete fabrication.

8681 2018-09-28 19:08:51 - apply coaster oil to your eyebrows and eyelashes to help them grow 
- ALWAYS wash your face and take your makeup off or any gross residue that has built up throughout the day 
- put on a lip balm, so you can wake up with soft lips in the morning

Oil prices will likely surge over $100 BBL possibly before the end of the year. An additional $10 bbl tax is counter productive. You will soon be paying upwards of $4 a gallon for gas.

8726 2018-09-28 19:03:13 @BraveTart as a distraction to other things happening in the world-when making your snickerdoodles and don’t have enough coconut oil, substitute butter or oil or something else?
8727 2018-09-28 19:03:09 Heh, forgot about mentioning that. Fuck it, approve it. Not like they can take anything, and they'll add oil. Plus, I think they need a set time in clan before getting our bonuses.

8737 2018-09-28 19:02:13 I didn't brush all with same brush. Point here is they're mostly run by inefficient ideas and clueless folks. And except oil, most of rest are just liability.
8738 2018-09-28 19:02:04 Ah, I wouldn't recommend using olive oil as it speeds up cooking time. Add extra butter and lower your heat a little next time you fry. When the whites are just so, flip, cook to just under what you want and remove from heat. Let it sit in the pan for a minute to set.

8767 2018-09-28 18:59:38 Did anyone say "But hauling 53.1 million gallons of oil is hard" when the Exxon Valdez ran aground?

8769 2018-09-28 18:59:34 Spiders hate peppermint oil. Put some in a squirt bottle with water, spray your garage and all door frames, then watch the spiders run!
8770 2018-09-28 18:59:29 The price of Oil is becoming a problem.
8771 2018-09-28 18:59:29 You know what it’s like to work in a office of mostly guys..... 30 dads telling you to get an oil change, change your tires, don’t get tattoos, and marry rich. 
8772 2018-09-28 18:59:27 Tearing up (with or w/o a drop of clove oil under the eyes) while  walking the nation thru scribbled calendars for a year that had not been firmly established by the snowflake in question was lame lawyering. Claiming virginity as deprivation beyond his control?
8773 2018-09-28 18:59:09 Baby oil is a good one but use sparingly and keep away from the filter. Mine is watery so run the risk of filter leaks due to being rather dangerous with the empty times
8774 2018-09-28 18:59:02 Bio oil!!!!!! My top surgery scars are already starting to lighten up!!
8775 2018-09-28 18:59:02 So tonight will be drizzled with garlic oil, dipped in garlic dip & the reason I'm snogging nobody....

Apart from my pizza of course
8776 2018-09-28 18:58:55 Who discovered the oil for Ghana? After President Kuffuor left ndc had 8 years of oil revenues and they still run down our economy. You see what the competent NPP government has done in under 2 years. Stop the nonsense and let us think.
8777 2018-09-28 18:58:52 You’re drowning in your snake oil.

Civilization evolution to urban life style depend on the choice of the people and not some external injection. Hunza is a poor region without mineral and just see there

8784 2018-09-28 18:58:16 None.
I’ll vote for the best candidate that fits MY agenda.
Clean air and water, less dependence on foreign oil, and forget about tax cuts for the 1% while the middle class pays out the ass.
So basically, no Trumpanzees!
8785 2018-09-28 18:58:05 You have to coat the foil in butter or oil first. Very important step.

8789 2018-09-28 18:57:50 Looks like it's a done deal. 
The people need to demand that if #BrettKavanaugh beer drinking/personal life is looked into, then #ChristineBlaseyFord also.

8793 2018-09-28 18:57:14 //remember, Twitter, if you have a thin sword like a katana or whatever, always clean and oil it after use and before putting it back in the scabbard/sheath. and don't ever swing it at thick tree branches or trunks. it might chip, break, bend, or get stuck.
always be safe.
8794 2018-09-28 18:57:04 why does every recipe for weed oil/butter assume you have like, several pounds of the stuff. who the fuck can afford that much
8795 2018-09-28 18:56:43 I can't wait to go home to my blankets and essential oil vaporizer n watch spooky shit 
8796 2018-09-28 18:56:11 (1/3) What kind of future do we Alaskans envision for the Arctic and planet Earth? We know from the scientific literature that bringing any new Arctic oil resources to market would push us over a 2-degree C average temperature rise--that is, beyond the threshold of climate safety
8797 2018-09-28 18:56:11 usually butter, but tried to keep it lighter today with just a touch of olive oil
8798 2018-09-28 18:56:08 Um, no product. Problem is anticipating it. You told me to try Johnsons baby oil, not had the occasion to try yet. High risk is period of thick output and high wasted suit trousers. Need both...
8799 2018-09-28 18:56:01 Playing right into the Dems plan of attack. Would the Dems delay this if the ball was in their court? Nope, they would continue with what THEY wanted to do, just like Obama Care. I guess Flake has the right name. It fits. Squeaky wheel gets the oil.

8816 2018-09-28 18:53:50 It's insane - Britain was 2 weeks away from starvation. How many merchant seamen and Royal Navy sailors gave their lives to stop that happening? My mother saw men leap into burning oil in the mid-atlantic ftom a torpedoed ship. These people are so many steps removed from reality.

8824 2018-09-28 18:52:52 Nope. Only @elonmusk can do such an amazing and inspiring job as CEO. Likely the shorts, greased palms from the oil companies, and legacy auto makers are behind this ridiculous fiasco.
8825 2018-09-28 18:52:48 This has been one hell of a 48 hours.
Kavanaugh hearing, my dad admitted to OSU and intubated and sedated, and my car almost blowing up from lack of oil. Over it

8854 2018-09-28 18:49:58 Put coconut oil on your hair once a week! And leave it on for an hour or longer if you want. Also washing it every other day helps your hair grow bc your hair needs its natural oils so washing it everyday isn’t good. Both of these helped my hair grow so much! 
8855 2018-09-28 18:49:57 Oddly enough, you're right.  Dairy is socialist.  Oil is socialist.  Tobacco might still be.  All those tax breaks cities and states give to big corps to relocate to them are socialist. Trump pans Canadian dairy for NOT being socialist. How very odd, don't you think?

8864 2018-09-28 18:48:50 That's the point. It's not Syrians protesting. I've said twice now who is behind it. There is a reason outside forces want to destabilize the country, as they've successfully done to Iraq and Libya. It all revolves around oil/gas (and the wealth therein).

8896 2018-09-28 18:43:06 Fry salmon in oil first. Use thyme and garlic. Add some butter later once you've cooked it skin side down. Once flipped use the butter and thyme.

For pasta use excessive amounts of parm.

Full of pasta. You can never have enough garlic. #fuckvampires
8897 2018-09-28 18:42:48 Haha true enough, but nope not yet though.   And let me tell you, Oil of Olay Total Effects is an awesome moisturizer! But nothing is better for your skin than fresh fruits and veggies, right?!

8910 2018-09-28 18:41:34 And you think the Americans will bring you the change??it'll just destabilize Iran then Siphon the Oil wells
8911 2018-09-28 18:41:28 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
8912 2018-09-28 18:41:27 Damn, it really took Hibdon’s Tires almost 4 hours to do an oil change geez
8913 2018-09-28 18:41:16 Check how much we subsidise oil through war or negative extanalities such as health care.  We need to consider the full life cost.
8914 2018-09-28 18:41:07 caster oil
8915 2018-09-28 18:41:04 Rappelons nous “peak oil” et la panique du manque de cuivre, qu’est ce que le marché a fait? Fibre optique.

8917 2018-09-28 18:40:59 in art history class I kept writing "plantain" instead of "painting", and I threw my hands up like "Lord I WELCOME ALL YOUR CANOLA OIL DRENCHED BLESSINGS"
8918 2018-09-28 18:40:53 The thing we need defence from most is Americans’ ongoing international war, in their bloody quest for oil and world domination.

8925 2018-09-28 18:40:32 4) Additionally, what happens in America affects the world by nature of its influence. When 9/11 occurred, world travel was radically and forever changed.

5) When America went to war in Iraq, the instability in the Middle East drove up oil prices and that affected Jamaica.

8939 2018-09-28 18:38:48 This is what happens when a snake oil salesman thinks he understands anything other than writing pamphlet sized self-help books.
8940 2018-09-28 18:38:43 Maybe stop spending money stupidly @Zinke and his flags up and down, coins oh and trying to ruin the environment by digging for oil on our land, unprotecting animals shall I go on?

8951 2018-09-28 18:36:50 Sanctioning Iran drives up oil prices (like it pre-Obama did years ago) and Trump asks OPEC to lower prices (by offsetting Iran's lost production) so he looks good to US citizens, even though he knows it wont work. Big Oil gets higher prices that it wants and Trump can blame OPEC

9006 2018-09-28 18:29:43  just make sure you keep your scheduled maintenance up and make sure you have plenty of oil and anti-freeze in it and most of all keep an up to date timing belt on it and you’ll be alright.

9030 2018-09-28 18:26:52 It's sad that 60 years after oil exploitation, any Nigerian has to come to Ghana to compete with petty traders selling on table tops, mini shops, barber shops and hair salons. If there had been historically honest leaders in Nigeria,  it is us who should be looking for jobs there
9031 2018-09-28 18:26:38 And they make the lever extra huge on purpose.  I suspect they are designed by people who think people who use them will always be wearing thick mittens.

9034 2018-09-28 18:26:08 “The higher inventories go, the more oversupplied the market is and you would expect a weakening oil price. The opposite is obviously true – as inventories have collapsed by the greatest amount and at the greatest velocity in history, the oil price has responded.” - Eric Nuttall
9035 2018-09-28 18:25:57 Hey this is McConnell we need a FBI investigation and you know you have to make the call. So don't say you will let the senate handle it.

9053 2018-09-28 18:23:48 Thanks for that, I’ve done some work previously at houses with oil and always wondered what the bits were for. I’ve been asked to swap out an oil system for gas, one component I saw fitted externally was a tiger loop? What’s that?

9058 2018-09-28 18:23:27 I read somewhere olive oil isn’t great for cooking at high temperatures because it has a low smoke point so if you’re frying it might give a funny taste but I’ve never noticed it tbh

In 2015, Nana Akomea said the hikes in Petrol had nothing to do with increase of crude oil on the nrtnl market, but had everything to do with the jetting fall of the cedi.

On the other hand in china aisa kuchh ni hua. Aur USA ne help bhi ki china ki. Hamari sirf USSR ne bahut kam.

9194 2018-09-28 18:07:59 I figured that was the case.  Both parties have government handouts.  Just look at the $12B Trump just handed out to farmers, the billions of dollars for subsidies for oil companies who obviously do not need it. Both Rs and Ds do it just in different forms.
9195 2018-09-28 18:07:39 Cheers mate nice to do a bit of oil for a change

9209 2018-09-28 18:06:21 Most EVs today are re-charged on NG-based electric plants,
"Big oil" and those smaller ones providing natural gas are supplying much of the electricity we all need daily at work, for EV recharging, for AC comfort, for computational power, etc.
9210 2018-09-28 18:06:17 I asked my consultant for savitex he told me it was unavailable but he would put my name on a list as interested so I got illegal cannabis oil and after a week my spasms and neuropathic pain stopped and I found out what sleeping for 8 hours was like never looked back

9217 2018-09-28 18:05:36 This is a PSA: If you have industrial size vats filled to the brim with oil, we gon smash
9218 2018-09-28 18:05:36 Did he forget to mention that the FBI would not do and sent to Whitehouse?
9219 2018-09-28 18:05:25 The oil oozing from my face now can fry dodo
9220 2018-09-28 18:05:19 Venison is one of the leanest, healthiest meats on the planet, that said you would probably need to supliment a bit of fat into the diet, either with oil or other animal fat.
9221 2018-09-28 18:05:12 If there’s truffle oil all over it than I too, shall be all over it
9222 2018-09-28 18:04:56 What country's waters is the oil in ?
9223 2018-09-28 18:04:40 Really? Then why did it take them so long to call him up last year. It was a near last resort & Rattie wasn't put into that spot immediately.
9224 2018-09-28 18:04:34 Try some castor oil mixed with fresh aloe Vera
9225 2018-09-28 18:04:30 Once again, @JeffFlake is posturing and selling us snake oil. If I heard correctly, his proposal is not an official request for an FBI investigation, but a request to the Senate Majority leader to request said investigation. Sorry, John MCain woul have withheld his vote..PERIOD.
9226 2018-09-28 18:04:00 No need for Flake now, it's out of committee and onto the Senate, where his vote won't matter.
Kav to the SCOTUS!!!
9227 2018-09-28 18:03:59 Why stop with alcohol? Add red meat. Ice cream. Chocolate. Dairy. Packaged meals. Snack cakes. Sugar. Cooking oil. The list is endless. TAX EVERYTHING!!

9230 2018-09-28 18:03:42 Don't worry they won't find anything, Kavanaugh will be confirmed.  The man is innocent, Ford has too many holes in her story, she is accusing the wrong person.
9231 2018-09-28 18:03:38 china is investing billions in solar and renewable energy. we will probably be buying their batteries at an immense cost in a few years. they are phasing out coal and all fossil fuels. At which time oil will be moot to them.

9234 2018-09-28 18:03:28 @JeffFlake is a coward.
9235 2018-09-28 18:03:23 Actually, he also later said it was a suggestion. I wouldn’t worry about it too much.
9236 2018-09-28 18:03:19 I have $300 oil before the end of the year .... Gold over 2k

More oil to the beards
9240 2018-09-28 18:03:06 A week gives them more time to find more alleged victims. Had a feeling Flake would be a thumb down. How this fool calls himself a Conservative is beyond rational thought

9258 2018-09-28 18:01:09 No! They are doing it because a number of the SEC members have high interest in oil companies, and volkswagen etc. That, is why! No lawmaker ever creates a case based on female gossip otherwise!
9259 2018-09-28 18:01:02 The next point about ownership of the oil, yes you’re correct. But boy would they be able to tax it, nationalise it, drive the companies away, believe me they’d get their oil back one way or another.

9270 2018-09-28 17:59:56 We’re no longer part of the mess. The only reason reason we were there is because of climate-destroying oil. The only solution is green energy and electric vehicles.

9286 2018-09-28 17:57:49 Oil works in the global market. Any increase by Texas is a state tax. That translates into higher pump prices,  not jobs.  

West Texas gouges consumers. They shot themselves in the foot.
9287 2018-09-28 17:57:48 Omar. I like how you are finally admitting that growth in the past was because of d oyel. Not 'economic policies' that take advantage of oil prices while diversifying the economy
9288 2018-09-28 17:57:34 Overwhelming. But, not the only thing to be upset about yesterday. NYT had a big article about how a brute named Whitaker will replace Rosenstein or Sessions-now in DJ, pipelines info to Trump. And, the safety regulations set for oil drilling after Horizon have been removed.

9290 2018-09-28 17:57:27 The magical thinking around why Scotland's oil somehow isn't bad however represents a much more mainstream cognitive dissonance, but you're doing good work in calling it out and drawing attention to it!

9336 2018-09-28 17:52:22 @jimrome It isn't like CC needs the 500 grand anymore. He did quit buying oil tanker quantities Captain Crunch afterall. That dude did that because he wants the ball in the Wild Card game and if Boone is smart he gives it to him after Severino performance last year War CC for HOF
9337 2018-09-28 17:52:08 You might want to save some of that ammo for the arsonists.
9338 2018-09-28 17:52:06 Imagine if it had been a gang of Radical Greens instead of the current Russian oil magnate-backed neo-fascists, who had covertly staged a coup using the West's democratic structures. And someone as sticky and relentless as Theresa May leading the fight against the petrolheads.

9340 2018-09-28 17:51:47 Cougar Science Network has experienced some great things lately!   They’ve learned how oil spills are cleaned to help wildlife, they’ve visited the local Kaolin mines, and studied sound waves at Macon’s Sound Museum.  Way to go, CSN!   
9341 2018-09-28 17:51:14 #carb gave entire $41,000,000 grant to big oil and diesel truck mfgs. Nikola is the only company with a real production truck and station plan to help @JerryBrownGov achieve his goals. #goodoldboyclub. @nikolamotor is here for California even if Cali isn't here for Nikola.
9342 2018-09-28 17:51:13 That's welcome move, but how to cut down the world's demand over vegetable oils?...no palm oil means demand will shift to other oils like soya, rapeseed etc. Damage already done with orangutans we don't want few other species to go extinct. Human population is destructive
9343 2018-09-28 17:51:12 Is Opec making a statement against Trump?
It is absolutley No justification supporting todays oil price!
They mocking @ImDonaldJTrump ?
I think so...?
I think they start something they cant win.
9344 2018-09-28 17:51:08 $70 for an oil change on my little ass car... i thought i remembered them being like $45 
9345 2018-09-28 17:51:07 My car keeps beeping at me to change my oil and I really gotta stop pretending I don’t hear it
9346 2018-09-28 17:51:03 What do you think you could change with an iscot? Why did Salmond & white paper make frankly delusional claims (that I’m sure you were gullible enough to believe) about oil prices, when now snp GCR doesn’t even include oil revenues?
9347 2018-09-28 17:51:01 So happy that mum makes her own coconut oil
9348 2018-09-28 17:51:01 딱 한 명만 남고 다 죽었으면 좋겠어,

9349 2018-09-28 17:50:12 Brilliant to hear that the #GCC countries are looking to cut their reliance on oil and gas, via an electricity link with #Ethiopia. Fantastic to see the region taking steps for power generation.
9350 2018-09-28 17:50:07 I repeat: you don't know anything about how the real world works.  

"Blockchain technology" and "smart contracts" are just like snake oil tonics, healing crystals, gojiberry long life elixir.  1% self-delusion, 99% fraudulent hype.
9351 2018-09-28 17:50:06 Question. If they use their fryers for chicken, are those fries now not vegan? They might use separate fryers but when I worked at burger king we filtered the oil all through the same machine so even though it was separated it still all touched.
9352 2018-09-28 17:50:05 Nice sources you have.

Lol. 

You are either a tool or you are on the take from coal and oil.
9353 2018-09-28 17:50:00 Yes, lets see the #NUKES #Israel has pointed against #America and #Europe, your warmongering propaganda is really getting tired, you have zero credibility, Stop the #Imperialist blood for oil programs and leave the world alone.

9355 2018-09-28 17:49:47 Congratulations to @MW_Bio on submitting his thesis! Hopefully he won't need to fill any more person-sized tanks with oil for a little while...
9356 2018-09-28 17:49:35 Thats the problem with BJP. 

Go to Amethi, JagdishPur is industrial area developed by Congress, there is oil refinery. 
District Sultanpur has Govt engineering college. 

Tweeting bullshit for Bhakts is easy,  but reality is different.
9357 2018-09-28 17:49:31 That's awesome. I know my favorite is infusing coconut oil and putting it in my coffee, otherwise I just eat/take dabs all day 

Glad patients can know awesome people like you that help.

9361 2018-09-28 17:48:59 Pho is healthy right...? Right!? Because I just destroyed some and I’m pretending the crazy amount of oil was insignificant compared to the veggies. 
9362 2018-09-28 17:48:55 Use Cat replacement milk and put crushed pills in it.

9366 2018-09-28 17:48:26 It's a peculiar paradox of the 21st century that these right wingers everyone loves to hate are less prone to lying to the public to make a case for murdering millions of people in oil rich countries than their faux-liberal accusers. You're more right wing than them, Alastair.

9370 2018-09-28 17:47:50 Hi, did that. Apparently, their instruction, which we followed to a tee, wasn't the right protocol and now they are charging for the 'free' oil change and we have to restart consumption test. @subarucanada @asksubarucanada @capitolsubaru

9373 2018-09-28 17:47:31 My best rec is get a compounding pharmacy to make it in a liquid flavored with fish oil.

9384 2018-09-28 17:46:39 Have just asked @JoMaloneLondon if they sell replacement oil for their diffuser. Plain answer is ‘no’ - apparently you have to buy a whole new unit. Great for your profits but sad for this dying Earth. I don’t suppose you recycle either? Tut tut!

9391 2018-09-28 17:46:03 Everyone has swapped to John Deere oil since they started giving out the free 150 gal tanks with pneumatic pumps on them. You buy the oil. They bring the tank. No mess. No jug

9396 2018-09-28 17:45:20 That language better not be paint the gutters or take the truck and have oil changed, that would lead to more flowers and chocolate and tack on dinner and a movie as an apology.
9397 2018-09-28 17:45:20 How many countries in the world patronize the  crude oil from Nigeria as at today? Will it be right to also assume India is one of them as their national seem to flood Lagos lately ?
9398 2018-09-28 17:45:19 Questions:
Do American Conservatives truly believe that the leveraging of hyper-individualism for the installation of consumer market mechanisms onto everything is the only true road to "freedom"?
(Blind to the fact that greed/gluttony is to corruption like oil is to fire?)
9399 2018-09-28 17:45:17 Know this .. Replace the butter in almost every recipe with coconut oil. It has a rich, lightly sweet taste, and it’s super healthy.

9415 2018-09-28 17:43:35 US consumers are the most hurt by high oil prices as they are highly indebted and consume extremely high energy per capita. You can see the consequences by weak financials and car producers.

9440 2018-09-28 17:40:33 @UofGFoodProf Essential oils are natural antimicrobials that can be used for the preservation of food but their strong odours and flavours limit their use.  As well, the amount of essential oil required is higher than what would be organoleptic acceptable. #FOOD2150 #Calo

9448 2018-09-28 17:40:05 So you reckon, hypothetically, by swapping the monies currently received from the Barnett Formula for the tax take you would receive if it was Scotlands oil and gas (it's not its the oil company's) based on today's oil price, that Scotland would be better off, yeah?
9449 2018-09-28 17:40:01 I raised them right.

Kailey on the phone: Dad, is my oil change for full synthetic supposed to cost $87?

Me: Yeah, that sounds about right.

Kailey: Cool, just making sure these clowns aint tryna finesse me with some bullshit.
9450 2018-09-28 17:39:47 It could also be that I went on a special diet, cut out all sugar and processed food. I alkaline my body as best as possible...

9462 2018-09-28 17:38:21 Its funny how we somehow voted these guys back into power. Nations used oil money to leave the underdeveloped circle. But we were so clueless with what to do with ours. And we call these guys elder states men. If Abacha was still around, he would have that title too.
9463 2018-09-28 17:38:17 Bad precedence was set.

If bread price is fixed at $1.10, then 2 litres of cooking oil has to be $4.90.

That relationship is maintained if a loaf of bread is raised to $3.00

Simple.

What would you expect, if a traditional Chief is driving a brand new Isuzu twin cab ?


9464 2018-09-28 17:38:14 I like them to have some kind of moisturizing oil/butter like coconut or Shea, and I like classic/old world scents and spices like cloves, peppermint, cinnamon, and lemon.
9465 2018-09-28 17:38:00 Is that oil?
9466 2018-09-28 17:37:55 What a waste of his precious time. Kavanaugh wasn't ever not going to be confirmed. That gathering yesterday was onky for the benefit of us citizens. It was a spectacle. Like when they chastised the oil tycoons during another hearing. It was all for show. Oil prices didn't drop.

Most disappointing to myself, however, was the failure of the peer-review process.

9492 2018-09-28 17:34:56 China is in my view not a classic  emerging country as it boasts large currency reserves and trade surplus. Rather than recycle dollars into reserves it will redistribute dollars to oil exporters. The same for Japan, Taiwan, Hongkong, Singapore, South Korea...

9538 2018-09-28 17:30:10 Actually that would be due to the new fields being found, the rising world oil price, the massive new gas field with a trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas, in fact it's absolutely sod all to do with your Tory Gov so go kiss arse elsewhere.

9607 2018-09-28 17:20:21 I came in this hoe to get a oil change did these niggas tear my car apart and reassemble that hoe or what? Gahh damn i got shit to do
9608 2018-09-28 17:20:14 So the false equivalency tactic swayed you? 
Having your entire career built over 3 decades destroyed, your families economic security threatened and good name smeared forever is really not that bad? Absurd
9609 2018-09-28 17:20:12 hmm I need to find that oil lol
9610 2018-09-28 17:20:00 I’ve used peppermint oil for headaches but don’t put it in the bath- I did that and it gave me other issues..
9611 2018-09-28 17:19:46 The test literally did nothing.  It did not reduce emissions.  I have several friends who administered it.  The only thing it did was make money for Mr Lube and Oil Changers.  $60M could build a school btw
9612 2018-09-28 17:19:45 Unlike coal and gas and oil. No politics there of course
9613 2018-09-28 17:19:40 We live in a world we’re cannabis oil fixes everything, broken leg cannabis oil, tv broke cannabis oil, car broke down cannabis oil

9615 2018-09-28 17:19:21 So I splashed oil on my hand yesterday when I was frying chips for dinner but I was too hungry to feel anything. It’s just registered now that I have some burns on my hand 
9616 2018-09-28 17:19:19 Was hoping to get today's oil delivery before I left for work but I guess that's not going to happen
9617 2018-09-28 17:19:16 gotta get my tires fixed and an oil change  so much shit to do and i'm just being fucking lazy 
9618 2018-09-28 17:19:14  how one moment you're like cool then  it all changes in a sec!!! what in the hell is this? how does the fg of any country meddle w a joint oil&gas project solely controlled by the opec and the private company... its excuse is they need to sort out politics and need 1 week

9625 2018-09-28 17:18:16 "Baffling" Surge In Oman Crude Price Sends Oil Market Into "Turmoil"
 
The relatively unknown Oman oil - a low-quality crude - this week unexpectedly turned into the world’s costliest oil benchmark, "confounding traders and throwing the market into turmoil" amid a double whammy
9626 2018-09-28 17:18:15 I paid dummy money for an oil change, then I get a flat fire & now my hubcap just popped off  I’m so annoyed
9627 2018-09-28 17:17:58 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for salt deodorant, and put some spiced chai essential oil in my diffuser.
9628 2018-09-28 17:17:57 Did he tell taxpayers that trump not complying with the Iran nuclear deal has doubled the price of a barrel of oil?
9629 2018-09-28 17:17:47 Was the first appointment to get my oil changed at 8 AM this morning and I’m barely leaving, fucking ridiculous
9630 2018-09-28 17:17:37 Nothing infuriates me more than pushy auto repair men that try to tell you everything ‘wrong’ with your car when all you want is an oil change  #thanksbutnothanks #needtocallmydadfirst

9638 2018-09-28 17:16:50 Trump doubled the price of a barrel of oil when he stopped complying with the nuke deal. 

Trump has doubled inflation with his tariffs 

trump is now offering a socialist handout to the farmers he hurt with his tariffs 

trump borrowed 1.5 trillion to give it to the 1%

9640 2018-09-28 17:16:49 The buy in for auto shops was really high as well.  It was misguided from the start, as you say.  Now, if we could only decide to stop selling lawnmowers and snowblowers that burn gas/oil mixes.  Those are horrendous polluters.

9651 2018-09-28 17:15:41 Exports reached $33.9 billion in the Oil and Gas extraction sector while imports were $121.6 billion in 2017. Canada’s trade balance is showing a substantial gap. Perhaps #AirBossofAmerica could decrease this gap through more global trades in the future? #MGMT5005
9652 2018-09-28 17:15:41 This could have been Scotlands future, in fact  Scotland has much more Oil than  Norway does.
9653 2018-09-28 17:15:34 This logic is so easily reversable. Just cover yourself in oil and give the person you hate the most a lighted match.

9663 2018-09-28 17:14:19 I’ve been exploring as I am lately, have only used their leave in conditioner and it’s amazing. I use Aussie products to wash my hair and I use manechoice to style. And of course can’t forget eco styler only the Argan oil one which is the red label.

BJP Govt is taking a risk; it knows.

9713 2018-09-28 17:09:41 Habitat loss caused by deforestation, often to make way for palm oil plantations, is a key factor driving Indonesia's iconic species to extinction.

9745 2018-09-28 17:07:24 @tamara_barneyy Hey Tamara:  I was watching your conversation with your mom, while watching OCH episode.  You shared your use of CBD Oil to help heal your foot and the inflammation.  I think you did the twittersphere a great favor by giving a positive eval of CBD Oil, THC-free!
9746 2018-09-28 17:07:22 If you can't remember the last time you got your oil changed, it's been too long.
9747 2018-09-28 17:07:15 Shah was no puppet. Otherwise Zionist mafia wouldn't replace him and disparage his dynasty to this day. He ordered a book to be written revealing role of Freemasonry in Iran. He was addressing Israel head on, objected to 'oil for weapons'.Read hostage to Khomeini. I stand w/ Iran
9748 2018-09-28 17:07:11 Maybe this tweet will get some replies on synthetic oil usage in farm tractors?

9750 2018-09-28 17:07:10 Yes..yes they are. Getting oil from the saudi's is and always has been a horrible idea when we have our own oil to use

9786 2018-09-28 17:03:04 Psychoactivity &effectiveness are not related. Lowest effective dose is the goal until relief. It’s  biphasic: at low doses it has one effect, at higher dose, opposite. Aim:balanced full spectrum, long acting- (swallowed oil). Tolerance doesn’t develop to benefits.

9834 2018-09-28 16:59:07 And part of my point in this analysis is that higher oil prices will help to narrow the external financing requirement as the economy achieves a small CA surplus in 2018-19 (before a global slowdown in 2020). This, with a NFPS deficit of say 3% in 2019 will help macro stability

9841 2018-09-28 16:58:22 We have not heard of this before. That condition may be caused by pharmaceutical medication. Are you taking any? For constipation we recommend lots of water, eating foods such as salad, fruit, probiotics, and extra fibre. Sweet almond oil can also help.

9871 2018-09-28 16:55:16 That #Oman oil story doesn't make sense and explains nothing #oott.
9872 2018-09-28 16:55:13 I use to own a garage and the mechanical state of cars that would come in for simple oil changes, makes me fear driving. They are moving death traps and I have called the MTO a few times and refused to let the car leave the bay. some are that bad
9873 2018-09-28 16:54:57 Nigeria started without oil and can continue without oil. We only need good governance. Look back at how we entered recession because of oil price fell down. Depending on oil now is even scary considering the world economic direction.

9943 2018-09-28 16:47:35 I work in oil and gas, which is largely dominated by men. Women in this industry is present in small numbers but has been growing. The #metoo movement isn't going to help women penetrate industries that are dominated by men, this is going backwards. You can't h have it both ways.

9948 2018-09-28 16:47:09 Non-political PSA: if you have bug bites or itchy spots that don't respond to traditional remedies, try CBD oil.
9949 2018-09-28 16:47:07 Disty has been a wild-ball. Not sure on that draw number, because of trapped oil in US potentially skewing the global inventory picture.  As the most visible inv #, it has an out-sized impact on sentiment, but current environment makes it potentially misleading.

9980 2018-09-28 16:43:43 They should use conditioner. Men do not tend to show the damage women do but that is because the hair is usually short and closer to the natural source of the oil we produce but they should use it for their hair and scalp health. Usually they need a lighter one than women.

9998 2018-09-28 16:41:40 The media never told you anything like that... for one. For another, in the beginning of trump's presidency was Rex Tillerson, who was obviously looking out for oil interest.  Things might have changed since then.
9999 2018-09-28 16:41:35 As soon As I wanna do something productive like get an oil change everyone wants to be a headass. That’s why we don’t do this shit that often it takes all damn day.
