If you're competing against others with a lower marginal cost, you're going to get priced out, because the sales price will dip below -your- marginal cost.
1 2018-09-08 23:40:40 I looked at it years ago, to find that the diamond market was based on artificially driving up the price by literally hoarding the supply. They were master-hoarders. It should be criminal. Many commodities are treated as such. It is outright thievery.

11 2018-09-08 22:20:30 Yes, it would work. But Canada and the US have traditionally refused to tie in specific commodities and other issues to influence trade negotiations. It is kind of a “thing” in international relations ... Until Trump, that is. Using auto tariffs to coerce us on NAFTA or dairy?
12 2018-09-08 22:15:20 That's the same way he got around the NAFTA rules in placing a tariff on steel and aluminum from Canada. NAFTA states clearly you can't tariff these commodities unless it's a national security problem. So he lied!

39 2018-09-08 21:45:20 Mary, This EO outlines how the Fed would assure the even distribution of food, energy, machinery, water, and other commodities needed by all citizens after a major catastrophe or war were to happen in the US. It assures areas wouldn't hoard goods needed by other areas.
40 2018-09-08 21:40:08 Wot are talking about here? Lol. Airing games aren't cheap!!!! Football is one of the most expensive commodities in the market. @YaayiBayam, u wouldn't want us invest more than 250,000euro of tax payers money into a single game. It's so expensive!!!
41 2018-09-08 21:33:33 Fidget spinners & Beanie Babies were hot commodities at one time too.
42 2018-09-08 21:20:24 And trying to use slaves as commodities to gain money. I see where you were trying to go with it but it didn't work.
43 2018-09-08 21:13:41 What are the effects of everyone benefitting? Most American’s paychecks are consumed with health care costs, insurance, & higher-prices commodities, many of those affected by the president’s policies.
Wages haven’t risen on par with increased costs of living.
44 2018-09-08 21:08:41 MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.considerable aid, including money, fuel, fertilizer and various other commodities. The U!
45 2018-09-08 21:07:09 Holy shit. The commodities markets must be boring right now if Peter's eyeing shitcoins like this.
46 2018-09-08 20:48:12 He is realizing what the rest of us already knew. Li-Ion batteries are comprised of mostly commodities. The cost of commodity materials does not decrease with volume. Battery cost decreases and performance increases have to come though new tech, not a giant factory using old tech
47 2018-09-08 20:40:28 Yes. Producers of products and commodities compete with each other to produce said product/commodity more efficiently, thereby winning market share and increasing their profits.  It is a never-ending race.
48 2018-09-08 20:33:09 I love when we refer to things as “commodities” and “services” which dogwhistles to those who just don’t want to pay taxes.
49 2018-09-08 20:25:23 Over 70% of farm animals in the UK are raised in factory farms,  "real farms" as you put it, only provide a fraction of meat In this country. It's this shocking abuse and neglect that needs to stop. That's what happens when animals are treated as commodities.
50 2018-09-08 20:11:37 & of all commodities, masaya pa kayo na same price lang ang cigarettes?  

Gasoline prices are so high right now.  Full tank from 2k to 3k for our van.  So thanks Du30!
51 2018-09-08 20:08:00 also make selling and advertising gold and precious metals as investments follow the same rules as other investments like mutual funds and individual stocks, bonds, financial commodities, etc (or at least more strict/ more oversight than currently).
52 2018-09-08 20:02:09 ..and there’s the fourth type.
4. Dds through & through but pretending to be anti admin out of sheer frustration & anger, triggered by the high prices of basic commodities.

BS look at our country & economy now, in complete mess, its because of this 16M dimwits.
53 2018-09-08 20:00:01 #Gold and #silver, like other #commodities, have an intrinsic value, which is not arbitrary, but is dependent on their scarcity.
54 2018-09-08 19:55:16 Actually, unwinding trade relationships that took decades to build, alienating our allies, and creating openings in the international marketplace for commodities that we once filled but will now be filled by others weakens our position and the western alliance this helping Russia
55 2018-09-08 19:53:33 My free speech is the same as Donald Trump's.  Why should I get a cot while he sleeps on silk in a penthouse, if housing is a right?  We're all supposed to be equal in rights, remember?  So if commodities are rights, everyone should get the best shit.

IF they're rights, that is.
56 2018-09-08 19:46:51 I believe some tend look at it that way, however I don't agree. Corporations are private entities who commodities are people who they employ.
57 2018-09-08 19:46:20 10/10 Middlemen/aggregators, transporters, retailers also struggle to receive fair prices on some commodities which shows a huge gap on dissemination of information on agricultural value chains @agrarianac @FarmersAfric @GordiosFarms @ThandolwethuNya @ZRBFZIM @rodgers_kirwa

-Attention 
-Commitment 
-Praise 
-Love
-Time 

Work on yourself to the point these things become commodities in the lives of those around you.
62 2018-09-08 19:21:12 Commodities are becoming only available in hostile areas. 
Regional manufacturing will still require intermediate inputs from other countries. The US does not manufacture some specialized steel. Supply chains will still be long & risk of tariffs & export duties.
63 2018-09-08 19:10:34 Plans of VAT on fuel has geared up a high increase of commodities
64 2018-09-08 19:02:21 products and commodities are SCARCE. Not by arbitrary 'choice' of producers but because that's how the universe works.
65 2018-09-08 18:59:54 No, you just haven't thought this through. There is ALWAYS pressure to reduce the cost of products and commodities _in general_. Block space isn't special.  It doesn't mean that every company fails and that the price of everything falls to zero.

The free market works.
66 2018-09-08 18:53:47 why do "centrists" not challenging the Corbyn project on privatization: I personally think that the service minded UK can't so easily renationalize all commodities so easily,for example the NHS supply chains, I have no idea how that should work. 5/

69 2018-09-08 18:39:36 We’ll discuss this #DallasCowboys receiving corps on @FOX4 News late tonight, but I think @friscojosh would agree with me there are many unproven commodities.
70 2018-09-08 18:27:31 I know nothing, so don't listen to me, but think all commodities have risk here. My strategy has been to trim/cut some of the speculative positions & hold or even add to what I believe is strong. Long term, the prices here are a steal, but would keep some dry powder just in case.

72 2018-09-08 18:25:35 World Bank is publishing their pink data sheet again (whew!) and it looks like whatever revisions they were making didn’t affect their reporting of the prices of commodities (double whew!).
73 2018-09-08 18:23:39 ABC does not act like they care about their audience, especially for successful long-running series.  These series are just commodities to attract eyeballs for the commercials.  My loyalty to ABC is the same as their loyalty to me = zero.
74 2018-09-08 18:15:16 Holidays were kinda cool until social media created this culture that fetishizes and turns them into commodities.

76 2018-09-08 18:10:24 prohibiting commodities doesn’t work
criminalizing consumers doesn’t work
regulating the marketplaces works
why?  Because business is a metric that allows us to measure human cooperation/behavior
Market places exist no matter what “laws” are in place
77 2018-09-08 18:08:34 And what was the price of crude in 2013   ?
Stop fooling the people, the huge tail winds Modi dispensation had in 2014, with respect to low commodities prices,  has been been frittered away.
78 2018-09-08 18:05:10 It’s clear to us where we want to bring our business.  With the economy in the upswing then, we were doing well.  Now, not so.  What used to be spent on buying our products now makes up for the difference in the prices then vs now of basic commodities such as rice
79 2018-09-08 18:04:45 Called out by who? Trad con fuck wits who think women are commodities and can barely tie their shoelaces? People like you who talk cryptically and whine when called out for it?

81 2018-09-08 18:01:36 Right. I understand many are pro forced-birth & view women as commodities & are not pro-life. Just wasn't sure of any direct material connection (as in financial) between the 2
82 2018-09-08 18:00:12 The same can say in reverse, if you start to consider rights as commodities, certain things will follow. We just draw the line differently.

84 2018-09-08 17:53:02 It is not just apples, Donald.  And any increase in food and other commodities may not affect your billionaire friends but it does affect everybody else who is trying make ends meet.
85 2018-09-08 17:50:38 If you dont allow the government to impose tax on some commodities and criticise the government when it borrows how do you want the government to operate.
86 2018-09-08 17:46:43 Well even if he did diddle Stormy Daniels it is probably more real than Obama’s birth certificate or Hillary Clinton’s ability to earn money in the commodities and futures market. Just hope he didn’t catch the clap.
87 2018-09-08 17:46:24 Love the fact that you are standing up for what is ours but I believe it would be smart to have factories in place before the tarrifs. I sell commodities and the tarrifs are hurting more than helping at this point. American made materials aren’t available yet!

90 2018-09-08 17:32:49 How about, making ALL parts & components for autos, computers, smart-phones, appliances & electronics in USA & exporting em to global consumers from here? Not just produce goods & Ag commodities for DOMESTIC consumption here, but produce goods/products to supply INDO-PACIFIC, etc
91 2018-09-08 17:31:20 Yeah God forbid the shareholders and those who buy commodities for survival couldn't be any of their help for spending

94 2018-09-08 17:16:17 Inflation and commodities price rising in #Somaliland is getting on the nerve of the population! Still the government is unable to regulate foreign exchange.
95 2018-09-08 17:15:43 Say a customer wants a free car, but the dealership wants $30k for it. Who decides what the commodity is worth: the customer or the dealer? If it was up to the customer, do you think anybody would still be making cars? All commodities (even virtual ones) cost money to make.
96 2018-09-08 17:10:08 The only reason people can afford an iPhone is because it's made in China. With cheap commodities, cheap (slave by western standards)  labour and hideous working conditions. Too long we have turned a blind eye to where our cheap products come from.
97 2018-09-08 17:03:58 How about all those rate hikes the @federalreserve will do to suppress already out of control inflation while at the same time commodities get hammered into obvlivion

99 2018-09-08 16:54:06 China is very cleverly investing in African infrastructure with unconditional loans and grants. They’re emulating the American government, in paying for access to goods, materials and commodities. They know what they’re doing.

101 2018-09-08 16:39:02 Even if the economy grows at 3% the question is at what cost. The deficit is rising, inflation and commodities are up, so any tax benefit for the middle class and poor are gone. Health care and education costs are through the roof.
102 2018-09-08 16:37:27 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
103 2018-09-08 16:34:27 How does that got to do with opening our borders for every dick, Tom and Harry to bring in duty free essential commodities. He is very clueless
104 2018-09-08 16:31:51 I think a big part also is that equities tend to lead. Think it's also possible that investors see the price coming lower in the near future, even if it's temporary, not to mention that the equities I believe are getting dragged lower with all commodities at the moment.
105 2018-09-08 16:28:02 Interesting, applies to all kinds of markets. Securities, Commodities and Crypto.
106 2018-09-08 16:25:58 Ethereum could be following suit as second crypto to be traded on regulated futures exhange by the end of 2018 if US based  Commodities Futures Trading Commission gives the go ahead.
107 2018-09-08 16:22:06 You’re missing that China increasingly no longer needs to hold USD for any reason.  They announced this 5 yrs ago.  China still receives USD of course, but instead of holding those USDs in USTs, now they hold them in commodities, oil refineries, ghost cities, OBOR, gold.
108 2018-09-08 16:12:00 How? By making essential commodities unreachable.What a good progress?
109 2018-09-08 16:05:49 Bitcoin esta subvalorado a largo plazo, es estacional como los commodities y siempre presenta inviernos feroces, siempre el mejor momento para comprar ha sido cuando nadie habla mucho de el o lo den por muerto.

113 2018-09-08 15:54:20 Itumbi you are naive about regional trade. How can our commodities be competitive when the cost of production is sky rocketing ? #16% VAT.
114 2018-09-08 15:50:23 Moreover overall prices of essential commodities are in control rather than increasing trend like petrol and diesel..So it should be looked in totality

119 2018-09-08 15:33:40 There are hundreds of Metals and oil traders out here presenting them as pros but can't make any money. I think @chigrl is a legit follow if you are trading oil. There are also good some bloomberg guys on commodities like @JavierBlas
120 2018-09-08 15:29:40 IMO commodities except gold, silver and oil are untradable without a Bloomberg Terminal or something like that. There is no way of getting the news/data flow freely.
121 2018-09-08 15:24:43 True - my relatives with small herds would probabaly feed their cattle before they fed themselves. Unfortunately large scale industrial farmers do tend to see their cattle as commodities.
122 2018-09-08 15:15:44 The way Raman Malik is defending price hike of petrol and diese on TimesNowl, it appears the entire Government development schemes are dependent on fuel taxes.  If that is the case stop collecting taxes on other commodities.
123 2018-09-08 15:03:01 I think every president deserves time but context is important. Trump was handed a growing economy and the trajectory hasn’t changed much at all. Jobs are slightly lower than Obama’s last 18 months, inflation iand commodities are up. The deficit is also rising.
124 2018-09-08 14:57:59 Lou is that rarest of commodities - a journalist who gets it!
125 2018-09-08 14:55:52 These boasts need to stop. You are a broken record. The wages of those in the bottom 50% of income are stagnant, and while you and your stupid tariffs make commodities more expensive for us, our quality of life is decreasing. That means getting worse sir.
126 2018-09-08 14:53:41 These routes form a firm supply chain to feed commodities into China as the primary focus, but secondary and as importantly their military expansion is huge compared to where they were located 20 years ago.
127 2018-09-08 14:43:55 IMO “how” just isn’t that relevant now because there’s just so many different ways to do things at a high quality. Ideas and “figure-it-out-ness” are the hot commodities. That said, tips and tricks are great to show.. like “I had problem x and I found this work around”
128 2018-09-08 14:37:46 The corporate definition of love is obsessed with commodities, property, and hoarding of things and experiences.

130 2018-09-08 14:10:13 O PT equivocou-se na política econômica do país com inserções erradas que levou a economia a patamares baixos quando as commodities deixaram de ser a grande oportunidade de crescimento.Medidas não deram certo como tentar reverter o quadro  com estímulo ao consumismo interno.

133 2018-09-08 14:03:53 Thinking of doing. Y honours the following year. Need to bootstrap & work on growing my portfolio, I'm even thinking of pulling from some crypto positions & go back to betting on the dollar, yen & commodities 
134 2018-09-08 13:51:26 Some are, sure. I personally know several people in tech who sell commodities through Amazon on the side and double their income. So I’m hesitant to say “most” unless you’ve got data on it. And I feel like I’m delaying my retirement by not doing that kind of side hustle.
135 2018-09-08 13:50:19 Regarding GST it is based on simple maths with max GST rate of 28%...but remember prices of commodities depend on international price also.
136 2018-09-08 13:47:18 Memes são commodities. É preciso cautela ao gerir e mensurar o desempenho.
137 2018-09-08 13:46:27 Nearly all commodities if not all. But different hoops to jump through. Also pork, dairy, beef. This tariff has HURT all Ag commodities.
138 2018-09-08 13:43:20 Government is in denial mode to solve people problems ie rising prices of petrol diesel cooking gas and other essential commodities,falling of indian rupee . overall Government is in election mode

140 2018-09-08 13:37:07 Ma'am think of poor farmers and man on Street before making such nonsense comments. Essential commodities are on brink due to burning fuel price and you are obsessed with surpassing Britain.
141 2018-09-08 13:32:10 Sipag lang daw katapat nito! I get the point but they are not maximizing the sipag they are worth for because u couldnt buy much with the hard earned money because of rising prices of basic commodities.
142 2018-09-08 13:29:28 As the son of a commodities trader and as someone who spent a summer working on the floor I can tell you, with zero uncertainty, that this is false! Some of the traders are from NJ! The rest is true...
143 2018-09-08 13:26:53 Yeah...well seeing as the stock market has nothing to do with the commodities floor, you might want to take a second look at those stocks. #TheMoreYouKnow

147 2018-09-08 12:53:31 records of the east india company should give some info on economic importance of different commodities.
148 2018-09-08 12:31:43 That’s literally what fantasy football is. It’s not called ‘fantasy be a supportive friend to a player.’ They literally are commodities and assets.
149 2018-09-08 12:28:40 Anyone who thinks Nicki had beef with Stormi is dumb af. Do you guys really lack basic comprehension? The POINT was that since Kylie & her baby are such “hot commodities” in the community, telling people to buy tickets so you can see them on tour was extremely influencial.
150 2018-09-08 12:28:14 Honestly not trying to be too critical but, why play JHay or Jordy unless necessary the rest of the year. Both are not future Pirates, both are known commodities.

152 2018-09-08 11:57:11 who needs sex when we are fucked everyday by capitalism, rising prices of commodities, and the president?
153 2018-09-08 11:56:33 Yes, but under your administration it's beginning to be a disaster. Prices of common commodities like rice, fish snd vegetables have gone sky high. These are common fare for the common people and they are beyond their reach now.
154 2018-09-08 11:35:11 Always remember money is a commodity you use to buy other commodities. It's not everything!
155 2018-09-08 11:06:05 Cállate corrupto, vendido. Dos un desastre de político, nunca llegaste  a nada y vivís de chupar medias. La Sra.

156 2018-09-08 11:02:12 @ProfSteveKeen the tailwinds from commodities will slow. Rate cuts and lower dollar will help at the margins but increase in tax under Labour will swamp this.
157 2018-09-08 11:01:55 Earlier fuel prices shoot up, it used to have cascading effect on other commodities. Now the fuel prices are at all time high, but still the necessary commodities and vegetables prices are lower than 2014 level. Why and how.! If you can dwell on it you understand economy better.
158 2018-09-08 10:57:17 PriCES of commodities aren't going down too
159 2018-09-08 10:54:04 Those who clamped Pakistan into huge loans of its history and left nothing to pay back installments are objecting to the price increase of commodities.

169 2018-09-08 10:03:48 At BJP's national executive meet, West Bengal BJP Chief @DilipGhoshBJP tells me, 

"everyone knows fuel price has increased. But this hasn't disturbed the life of citizens. Price of essential commodities hasn't increased. There's peace. Terrorism & Communal violence have stopped"
170 2018-09-08 10:01:38 Duh. Local commodities whose prices have soared were not affected by US tariffs against Chinese goods entering the US. Ang layooooo! But it's fun to see you Digong na nangangapa! You just showed the world you have NO CLUE what's happening to our economy & how to solve it!!!

172 2018-09-08 09:50:09 True. I've recently left a central London teaching trust, where staff were treated like disposable commodities.A bit of support & care would help make the constant slog a little more bearable & is cheap to implement.
173 2018-09-08 09:47:59 Talk about the rise in food commodities n fuel we don't want stories
174 2018-09-08 09:39:48 Peter - I’m in New Zealand where we don’t have the history of hard core professionalism in sports but I get that players are basically commodities for big league franchises. But this kind of thing makes me sad.
175 2018-09-08 09:38:17 Yes, hike in fuel affect all as it involved in essential commodities.
176 2018-09-08 09:37:57 Hi Fabiana, yes we are! Although with a different question - a very interesting one. Look out for an announcement in October.
177 2018-09-08 09:37:19 Gyasiwaa say everybody want dii am rydee,hot commodities don’t stay in stores for long mmom
178 2018-09-08 09:37:10 opportunity cost...with commodities it is difficult to hold for long as you do not know where is the bottom..see your pf risk reward and book loss based on it. If it is small holding keep it on hold for now.
179 2018-09-08 09:29:55 Are you going to do this again?
180 2018-09-08 09:28:08 In 1998, BJP lost power in Delhi because of high prices of onions. That's the power of people against high prices of commodities.
181 2018-09-08 09:26:08 Under capitalism ppl are conditioned to see artists as commodities for their consumption thus dehumanising them but then an artist will die and some ppl will remember their humanity
182 2018-09-08 09:26:01 Global      Human beings are one of the biggest selling commodities unfortunately~  Evil
183 2018-09-08 09:25:07 Pls look at the price of essential commodities which are on gire due yo same. Bread price increased by 5 rupess. It will not hurt rich peeople like u but means a lot for middle & lower class
184 2018-09-08 09:23:32 The US & other allies, yes. The principal culprits belong to the Saudi government. Never forget geography and the control of the Hormuz Straits. To block chinese access to oil and gas and other commodities in Africa. The clowns at the United Nations can't stop this massacre.
185 2018-09-08 09:22:32 keep dreaming. prices of commodities are still low as compared to UPA, No corruption, no terrorist attacks, some big shots made to run to court. We are happy with him

193 2018-09-08 08:36:23 Total lie. What is "economy doing very well"? When the basic commodities prices are hiking like rockets and the basic amenities are in horrible conditions?

The prices of commodities increased drastically in recent days.
The inflation shocked me.
I think our country is in dire straits which needs to be called to attention and come up with a solution.

202 2018-09-08 07:47:55 Only vocal visions,better seriously UR Govt think of daily steep increases in petrol/diesel prices highly attributed to the escalation of essential commodities definately controlable if conscious extra punches of hidden clouds are brought out pl
203 2018-09-08 07:38:37 Difference is that football is now firstly a business not sport, players are the main commodities so are paid accordingly. Track racing is corrupt and a money maker for the big teams and organisers. Road racing however, is a sport run on passion..and some make a good living.
204 2018-09-08 07:35:50 @narendramodi  With the continuous rise in prices of commodities, provisions like petrol, vegetables it is getting difficult to make a living. It seemsthat  Govt policies to uplift the lower classes are boomeranging by bringing the middle classes into the bracket of lower classes
205 2018-09-08 07:28:40 Senator Baboy, prices of commodities will go down on its own but we will make sure Trillanes will rot in jail...
206 2018-09-08 07:28:06 As the price of the commodities increases, the real income decreases (holding other factors constant).

In simple terms, putangina si Duterte.

#Inflation
207 2018-09-08 07:20:30 Seems @BJP4India has conceded defeat in 2019 elections and that is why they are not at all bothered to control prices of commodities that common man consumes, shoulders have dropped and law and order situation is worsening day by day. Can't say what @narendramodi is thinking?

211 2018-09-08 07:06:37 Not to be a joyless libertarian, but hey, those are also libertarian values.

Who on earth would actually throw away human rights in favor of profit? Authoritarians, the same ones who support starting wars to gain commodities.
212 2018-09-08 07:00:00 The DTI has added more items in its suggested retail price (SRP) list for manufactured basic necessities and prime commodities.
213 2018-09-08 06:52:20 Sir.. Two issues I would request your highness to immediately address.. Most important is reducing the inflation-all essential commodities including reducing Petrol and diesel prices...And on humanitarian grounds increase central Relief fund for Kerala floods to the maximum..
214 2018-09-08 06:45:20 The commodities are so going to be stripped. Look what China did to Tibet
215 2018-09-08 06:40:47 Modi is physically fit but i think he should also become mentally stable to control the rising prices of commodities
216 2018-09-08 06:37:31 Due to increase in fuel prices rate of basic commodities will increase. At least give ppl something to cheer abt by reducing taxes on fuel. 2019 is election year. I wonder why bjp don't learn from their past mistakes.
217 2018-09-08 06:36:22 Apart from food,  I really don't think I need to buy or be gifted anything ever again. Unless time and space are commodities.
218 2018-09-08 06:30:06 Price control is a major part of governance. Diesel price increase has escalating effects on retail price of vegetables, and other commodities which get transported from producers to retailers.
219 2018-09-08 06:23:33 I can see league games being played in far flung corners of the globe to generate greater sales and tickets. Footballers are already commodities but now they'll be transported thousands of miles to entertain global fans
220 2018-09-08 06:20:44 Sila yung unang unang apektado ng price hike ng basic commodities.  Basic services like health centres medical program. PUV fares. 

Ay ang sad talaga!
221 2018-09-08 05:48:55 India also should stop subsidies to growing poor class who do not deserve it or change the rates of subsidized articles  which were fixed a decade ago & not comparable with present economics viz- Commodities (Rice & Wheat) at  Rs.2/- Rs.3/- a Kg .

I @WoodstockFarm; Jenny's story is inspiring!
237 2018-09-08 04:35:57 So technically oil price is rising but another phenomena is inflation in India is stable around 4%.So even when oil prices are rising , price  for other commodities are quite stable. Remember those days when oil prises rose by a couple of rupees that increased vegetable prices?

243 2018-09-08 03:50:33 "In the future token economy, a trade protocol will be essential to access commodities and utilities around the globe. Having this protocol means multiple dApps can bolt together to provide modular service sets that work together to create fluid forms of trade."
244 2018-09-08 03:30:46 They are extremely long time frame and few are investing on those time frames. I think they are useful for physically delivered commodities, but have to include sound technical analysis. COT intones what to do, but technical tells when.
245 2018-09-08 03:20:24 Los commodities, cuando son bien especulados, tienen el más alto ROI de todos los activos con un mínimo de estrés psicológico que aborde al analista.

Cuando especiales un commodity asegúrate de saber exactamente en qué época del año te encuentras y cómo está su producción.
246 2018-09-08 03:14:12 @PMOIndia pl take necessary steps to control petrol, $, & other commodities pricing coz people of India thinks more on these rathar than development etc. Last time they dropped #Atalji govt for onion price beware for 2019 to avoid same for @narendramodi govt.@BJP4India

249 2018-09-08 02:42:23 Commodities are not the entire market but your distrust is well placed.  The whole place is rigged against you since deregulation and the advent of high frequency trading.  I do know one person, a charts savant that makes money.  It's not for regular folks anymore.
250 2018-09-08 02:38:32 Even with little increase in #fuel #prices, there is much greater increase in the prices of general #commodities.This is a big problem in India. For most common Indians this appears to be unbearable.#GovtofIndia shd think over this.
251 2018-09-08 02:34:05 I believe it'll be a gradual push to higher value,  the mix will change and low grade commodities with lesser 'natural' appeal,  will be replaced with cheaper alternatives...the work will be in positioning the value products

Siendo el 1 el que más influye y el 5 el que menos influye.

255 2018-09-08 02:16:58 No VAT on Fuel,  Agriculture inputs and Basic commodities.
256 2018-09-08 02:08:50 I'm attempting to show you that, if you treat commodities as rights, if you have universal healthcare, then from that, certain things necessarily follow.  They're not all good things either.  You continue to argue from consequence, not principle.

258 2018-09-08 02:03:07 All of this is certainly interesting, and maybe we'll all learn once and for all that there really are no commodities from an end-user point of view #local #quality #nutrition

315 2018-09-09 22:23:51 like what ?

I see almost all commodities are cheaper than in Congress time.

with reduction of GST on certain items consumer durables are cheaper too.

Also if Middle class uses 30 ltrs of Petrol per month. 5 Rs hike in Petrol means 150 Rs 

150 is a hole in pocket ?
316 2018-09-09 22:23:01 Coppock on commodity? 
I thought it was most effective on stocks, not commodities?
I don't use it so I have no opinion, just surprised to see it here.
317 2018-09-09 22:21:57 Commercials are holding the opposite positions as the Speculators (including managed and leverage funds)

Commercial are the producers and users of the futures commodities who are the Hedgers and doing the hedges for their produced goods like Oil, Gold, Silvers. Not for profit.

I've done it in commodities, only when I was 90% sure the underlying would move BIG.

337 2018-09-09 20:57:18 Prices of common commodities hasn't gone up steeply, in many cases come down infact, which is more important considering upliftment of financially poor section.  Scope in tax deduction will somewhere neutralize other scheme fund . So this bandh is mere political stunt.
338 2018-09-09 20:46:06 It's not easy to just bring these industries. Many widely consumed devices are commodities feeding global supply chains. It's not simple to move a fab without disrupting thousands of businesses.

Which entirely lacks backing. He also ignores the importance of association
349 2018-09-09 19:24:39 This is true. What we are aiming for with this new administration is a complete reversal of this trend that results in a shrinking economy. It'll take some doing because people need to be educated to appreciate their own locally produced commodities and to add value to exports.

364 2018-09-09 18:23:48 I was a youngster who queued for and enjoyed GMB's 'essential commodities' sold during his short reign as military Head of state in 1984. Rationed rice, milk, sugar etc didn't mean much to rich families way back then, but it meant everything to the rest of us
365 2018-09-09 18:23:02 Very accurate Forex signals on YouTube every day with explanations and predictions. Currencies, Metals, Commodities, Cryptocurrency. #FX #CurrencyTips #Forex
366 2018-09-09 18:18:31 No, I mean affluence in a broader sense. I don't mean like 'having lots of commodities', but comfort/leisure and most of all free time. That Orwell line is hilarious tho. ;-)
367 2018-09-09 18:16:21 tá, mas e o pequeno produtor? aonde fica? e os índios aonde ficam? E o pequeno agricultor orgânico como vai sobreviver com uma política completamente voltada para as commodities? Com uma política que o ignora e o faz refém de um sistema explorador?
368 2018-09-09 18:14:18 You can pay as you like but what about common people who don't have purchasing power. The abnormal price rise of petrol and diesel is extra burden who are already facing 
abnormal price rise of essential commodities.
369 2018-09-09 18:13:09 Sunday night calls. Corn mixed up 1 cent, soybeans  up 1 , wheat steady.
Nothing new on trade talks, crop report Wednesday . Expect lower corn yields and higher soybean yields. Basis too wide for farmers to sell. #report#trump#yield#trade
370 2018-09-09 18:04:56 Jusko maam @iamkarendavila, mababaw ka na rin tulad nila. “ I am sorry to say that not arresting Trillanes will not bring down the prices of basic commodities either!” Kasi hindi po sila related or dependent to each other, gets?  Di bale ng mataas ang presyo, makulong lng sya!
371 2018-09-09 18:02:10 Peace, security and freedom are not finite commodities like land, oil or Gold, which one state can acquire at another's expense.
372 2018-09-09 17:44:11 Researching commodities is showing some fascinating information.

-Falling inventories 
-Secured long term supply falling
-Early stage exploration investment being more selective

Perfect timing for well run, cost conscious, invester aware businesses to strike out.
373 2018-09-09 17:43:17 #COMMODITIES usually sold in $. Labour costs usually in local currency increasing economic positivity
374 2018-09-09 17:42:53 County officials to enforce these payments electronically to avoid corruption and harassment. At the end we will have better food safety and tracking of commodities sold by vendors in Msa. Defaulters risk loosing their stall business or even arrest. There is potential mashinani
375 2018-09-09 17:37:02 Recession, not kinetic war.

If it is the only way for interior America to see how intertwined it is with the global community and trade/commodities/markets... then I fear it is inevitable.
376 2018-09-09 17:36:18 Karti Bhai didnt understand that high data BUT comman man understand only Lower prices of commodities 
And I wonder how despite higher diesel prices commodities prices are not sky high . HOW 
377 2018-09-09 17:35:47 On behalf of DCC (r) appeal to all citizen to extend their support to the Bharat Bhandh call on tomorrow from 5am to 5pm in protest against unprecedented rising of price of petrol ,,diesel, LpG and other essential commodities :
378 2018-09-09 17:28:07 The problem wasnt the fees majorly. The problem was Mr Bamwine saying that ugandans should take care of them. Them as Mps, so she was angry and wondering who takes care of is Ugandans. When taxes are hiked or imposed, schools also hike fees, commodities and services get higher.
379 2018-09-09 17:23:57 La mayoría de los alimentos tienen insumos en dólares o precios commodities .
380 2018-09-09 17:23:44 Nonsense. Almost consider the prices of bread and other commodities. Venezuela is basket economy despite having oil. All due to stupid communism and socialism and the bloodthirsty Communist.
381 2018-09-09 17:21:58 Reduce d fuel prices so tht common man can have commodities for everyday for his family. Such a liar govt, we voted for ache din, but sabse bure din we r seeing. #BharathBandh
#BJP_भगाओ_देश_बचाओ
382 2018-09-09 17:19:35 #FakeHeavyMetalFacts  heavy metal bands are traded on the commodities market
383 2018-09-09 17:19:16 Kenyan MPs are bribed to shut up on fuel hike..Rotich should know that, the economy of a Nation can't be enhanced thro increasing commodities price.If GoK wanna promote the economy of this Nation,thy should invest in innovation,Research & technology @Fchurii #Kiririmbi
384 2018-09-09 17:18:20 I voted BJP but I Support the #BharathBandh as
the common people are
suffuring due to
extreme hike of fuel
price, commodities and
fall of rupees against
dollar
385 2018-09-09 16:48:12 Yes there is growing evidence of such an inequality. This is how conferences in part become commodities

387 2018-09-09 16:44:41 2. Were people choose to dwell on trivial matters ignoring more sinister issues, epidemic outbreaks(typhoid), rise of basic commodities, impending shortages in various sectors, loss of LIFE (Aug 1), financial accountability among other issues and instead we exhibit hate & malice
388 2018-09-09 16:44:36 #BharatBandh will be for raising issues of petrol,diesel prices hike which has tumbled d people's way of living, even now small small itmes prices have raised, people who earn 50rs per day how they will get their daily commodities , need to think.
#BharatBandh
389 2018-09-09 16:32:03 El precio de los commodities fue hasta 2008, Uruguay siguió creciendo después de eso, a pesar del estancamiento argentino y brasilero.
Los commodities explicame pequeña parte del crecimiento.
390 2018-09-09 16:30:07 Hike in the price of petrolium ,no doubt,increases the burden of ordinary people. This may create a price hike in all goods.The price hike is not comparable with the hike of other commodities.
391 2018-09-09 16:25:35 Old enough to remember government commodities in the days before food stamps
392 2018-09-09 16:24:10 Gonna say this: 

Several players whom are currently college stars will find NFL doesnt think their game translates & won't be hot commodities. 

Also, several players whom not even die-hard college fans know, will be NFL career players due to NFL traits they have. 

Every year.
393 2018-09-09 16:16:50 So @KeTreasury and @HKRotich implement #16%VAT on petroleum products hoping to raise KES40Bn for budget support.

If the increase in price leads to collapsed consumption of the commodities, we might end up with a higher cost of living, and an even worse budget deficit position.
394 2018-09-09 16:13:09 Respecto a la politica economica llevada previa al 2001, es la misma que se llevo adelante luego del 2004, solo que con un contexto internacional mejor dado el precio de los commodities, que le permitio al FA gastar en lo que se le antojo. O sea que en este caso acerto.
395 2018-09-09 16:13:04 Prices of gas and petrol and diseal r at all time high resulting in soaring prices so high intobthe sky , essential commodities r becoming out of the reach of common man day by day
396 2018-09-09 15:57:37 Commodities are good short term. Like when Russia invaded Crimea and weat prices rose. Easy money.
397 2018-09-09 15:46:59 Out of all the things that could get affected by inflation, why choose the basic commodities?
398 2018-09-09 15:44:48 These people are today living on petrol/diesel. When vegetable prices and other commodities again touches high as during UPA then only think to eat others.
399 2018-09-09 15:40:34 The Union Government wants to sell the people of our nation as all the essential commodities prices are going to high to each and every day.
400 2018-09-09 15:39:40 Tho hindi naman ako mwe, pero hirap na ako mamili ng mga basic commodities.  Paano na lang yung mga sumasahod nang mababa pa sa minimum wage? Pota naman!
401 2018-09-09 15:35:01 Agree. C○stco was a madhouse yesterday. We made a couple stops this morning. Water and toilet paper appear to be the hot commodities.
402 2018-09-09 15:33:37 A questão é governabilidade. Também não gosto da miss motoserra de vice, mas até termos um projeto que possa mudar nossa dependência das commodities dependemos do agronegócio. Tão importante quanto a presidência é o voto em Dep. Federal e senador.
403 2018-09-09 15:30:20 Please crosscheck the price of food commodities in respect to unpaid salaries online in osun state
404 2018-09-09 15:22:56 Defense across the board is the best it’s ever been in MLB. Shifts, equipment, technique. Best it’s ever been. Pitching too. Really makes a hitter with great offensive prowess one of the most important commodities in the game, no??
405 2018-09-09 15:11:23 For all power, the church, and Proudhon. Each discovery, each thing a sociable animals, seeds, tools, money, commodities,
406 2018-09-09 15:08:52 No tiene nada que ver la natalidad con los precios. Los precios son altos porque estamos fajados a impuestos aranceles y tarifas. Se van más de los que vienen. El poder de compra subió por los precios de los commodities altos. Y obvio qué hay más empresas, A PESAR del FA.
407 2018-09-09 15:06:11 So petrol rs 82/l, diesel 78/ L, LPG cylinder rs 800, unemployment on peak, price of all essential commodities touching to sky. 
IS IT ALL FOR WELFARE OF JANTA ????
408 2018-09-09 15:05:41 Imaginate gobernando un tipo que ayer dijo 2 burradas: que Hugo Moyano es el mejor dirigente de la historia argentina y que nosotros tenemos que ponerle el precio a los cereales (son commodities, animallllllll!!!). Se nos vienen las 7 plagas de Egipto todas juntas!!
409 2018-09-09 15:03:52 I absolutely believe in taking care of children but not giving the parents a “card” which they abuse. Reinstate commodities. All of these benefits come out of the agricultural budget. It costs each taxpayer $20 a yr   So the answer is yes I care.
410 2018-09-09 15:00:22 No, but dairy, cotton and many other commodities get theirs....$12 Billion is the total
411 2018-09-09 14:56:09 First up all you know, essancial commodities? Perishable item not under GST. EB bills ask Lawalin looter Pranai Vijayan. Its under on his state govt. How much tax collected by state govt Petrolium products,
412 2018-09-09 14:56:02 PRICES OF COMMODITIES ARE SHOOTING UP DAY BY DAY.  MAIN REASON REASON HERE IS THE GST, WHICH IS TO BE BROUGHT TO LOWEST LEVEL, SAY TO 12 PER CENT.
413 2018-09-09 14:55:59 It's because the elitism of institutions filled with technocrats have generated a view that ppl are commodities and have a lower ROI than capital
414 2018-09-09 14:43:06 What commodity high rate? 
Don't blindly allaged? 
List here which essentially commodities higher price?
415 2018-09-09 14:35:47 Basic commodities aren't basic to some households now.

417 2018-09-09 14:27:46 Opinions are the cheapest  commodities on earth. Everyone has a flock of opinion ready to be wished upon anyone who will accept them.
418 2018-09-09 14:22:37 Stopping the smuggled and fake cigarettes will not only help in generating millions in taxes but also help the tobacco industry. Why make commodities expensive for common people?
419 2018-09-09 14:21:27 @BJP4India  common man do not bother about corruption and cast and religion politics. All he wants is low prices of fuel and commodities. Unlike vajpai if Modi wants to see a second term BJP should stop dreaming without reducing fuel prices. Common man is angry.please realize.
420 2018-09-09 14:15:55 Unforgivable offenses to all of us.  How can this be happening that the prices of basic commodities, water and utilities have skyrocketed? We have not learned anything from the Marcos dictatorship.  People get blinded by false hope and yet Dutards continue to show arrogance.
421 2018-09-09 13:58:13 i think IK must also give option to psahtunes to donate in form of commodities like chars & cocaine in case they don't have cash.
422 2018-09-09 13:57:40 i think IK must also give option to psahtunes to donate in form of commodities like chars & cocaine in case they don't have cash.
423 2018-09-09 13:56:55 i think IK must also give option to psahtunes to donate in form of commodities like chars & cocaine in case they don't have cash.
424 2018-09-09 13:55:00 i think IK must give option to psahtunes that they can also donate in form of commodities like chars & cocaine if they don't have cash.
425 2018-09-09 13:54:25 i think think IK must give option to psahtunes that they can also donate in form of commodities like chars & cocaine if they don't have cash.
426 2018-09-09 13:46:27 They will pay when we start taxing cash going Western Union etc. Out of the Country on Friday. They also mail commodities bought on food stamps Not to mention the welfare costs of illegals for their anchor babies who are American cutizens
427 2018-09-09 13:40:08 Empower yourself by fighting your addiction to the capitalist commodities known as drugs.
428 2018-09-09 13:38:50 Brother, I have all the right to question what is wrong. If govt. Controlled the prices of commodities- it did it's job.  If the govt. Is not controlling the price of petrol or falling of Rupee value, it's not doing its job.
429 2018-09-09 13:33:43 Pl talk About the high price of essential commodities and petroleum product. Pl talk about your corruption. Pl talk about Rafel. Pl talk about ur scam of demonisation. Except your leaders, Andhbhakto, and sold and corrupt media are praising you. Otherwise now citizen knows u well
430 2018-09-09 13:29:07 How can BJP expect to people vote for BJP in 2019? Does BJP thinks people will forget their pain they suffered due to demonetisation, GST and suffering due to petrol, diesel, cooking gas, kerosene, commodities price hikes? People are still suffering in BJP's rule.
431 2018-09-09 13:27:01 Finally, tag along with a fighting CMDR and you can collect up Thargoid materials from destroyed scouts and interceptors. They are not corrosive unlike dropped Thargoid commodities, but scouts do leave behind a plume of caustic gas for about 20 seconds or so after popping.

434 2018-09-09 13:21:33 Heard an interesting comment yesterday on Bloomberg Surveillance that the EM slow down could just as likely be due to Chinese tightening (commodities and FDI)...
435 2018-09-09 13:19:51 not everyone is good in every,like economics, international trade, commodities.better to stick to ones area on social media
436 2018-09-09 13:13:41 With the prices of essential commodities sky rocketing following ever rising LPG and Petroleum products Modi Government celebrating hailing  its  growth story
437 2018-09-09 13:08:26 We gained lot petrol hike , commodities hike many more 
438 2018-09-09 13:01:54 The affect of fuel price hike is not limited on our own vehicle but commercial transport is also affected which forces them to hike their fair which in turn increases the price of essential commodities. So indeed it's gonna affect common people.
439 2018-09-09 12:57:23 This is easily researched. It impacted oil prices, commodities, credit spreads, bond yields, interest rates. Feel free to point out who was immune to all of that. And Lehman Brothers were in the City long before Gordon Brown was chancellor.
440 2018-09-09 12:56:03 The cost of living gets higher and higher....health insurance is not available to all....gas is high.....daily commodities are high....
441 2018-09-09 12:52:31 With prices of Diesel and Petrol going through the roof,prices of farm commodities plummeting and the all pervasive apathetic attitude of the Government. It becomes imperative for each one of us to express our sense of anguish and fully support the call for Bharat Bandh tomorrow
442 2018-09-09 12:51:19 Hope people will remember Majherhat bridge collapse and how same impacted their day to day life right from commuting to work to paying high price for commodities. You will get a chance to punish @mamataofficial in 2019 for all her deeds. 
#GirtaBengal
443 2018-09-09 12:49:45 Apparently his team is also leading on increasing the burden on the already burdened public with additional taxes and increasing prices of commodities. Seeing the direction of only increasing the burden while not providing adequate relief, as a PTI supporter I am fast losing hope
444 2018-09-09 12:48:26 Sana naman huwag nating awayin yung mga jeepney drivers dahil sa fare hike dahil biktima rin sila rito, kailangan nila ng dagdag kita para makabili ng basic commodities at mabuhay ang kanilang pamilya.
445 2018-09-09 12:48:06 Animals are not products
life doesn’t have a price
please consider going vegan 
Animals need our protection 
They are not commodities
They are sentient beings who deserve respect love and protection from harm
446 2018-09-09 12:38:36 And we don't understand the difference between price and value of commodities. I learnt how to deal with these people.
447 2018-09-09 12:37:27 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
448 2018-09-09 12:25:52 I mentioned before and warned you that;
Peso getting weak✓
Hoarding✓
Lacking of rice✓
Flock of Chinese products✓
Increases of basic commodities✓
.
.
.
And now,
Watch out...
.
.
The debt-trap  is just in the corner

449 2018-09-09 12:19:13 Even more prevalent in equity investing. In ‘90s we made fun of old timers buying commodities, which worked in 70s. I still default to tech stocks when bullish before stopping myself
450 2018-09-09 11:59:08 but why this bandh in the first place considering how UPA completely bankrupted 3 navratnas Indian Oil HPCL BPCL by 2014 beside prices of all essential commodities r 2day much lesser than August 2013 the Congress party is shameless
451 2018-09-09 11:43:08 The banker who trades in commodities is a murderer.
452 2018-09-09 11:32:05 Two key points worth noting, people use fiat to hold assets like real estates, art or commodities.  Fiat is a transaction media, cant be volatile, sharply gaining medium.  Also, not to forget, people earn 1000x what they were in same fiat 317 y ago.
453 2018-09-09 11:29:45 Nakakasawa na bickerings ng mga politicos. Bakit di na lang pagtuunan ng pansin paano malulunasan ang tuloy2 na pagtaas ng prime commodities. Medyo nahihirapan na ang masa lalu na ang mga ordinaryong Pilipino. Warningan ang mga nananamantala sa pagtaas ng mga presyo ng bilihin!
454 2018-09-09 11:25:50 U will not about transaction of 196 lakh tonnes of farm commodities of worth 49210.52k Cr under eNAM. 

U will not talk about distribution of 12.5 Cr soil health card

Because ur only agenda is: Modi Roko
455 2018-09-09 11:18:35 Wild dogs are the people who have medieval and bigoted beliefs like.

Earth is flat
Kafirs need to be converted
Peacefuls need to rule earth
Peaceful brotherhood
Support pedophilia
Support and practice polygamy
Treat ladies as commodities.
456 2018-09-09 11:18:10 Another reason why the inflationary pressures economists are predicting in this post QE cycle may not come for a while despite 2.9% wage growth in August data.  If gold can’t catch a bid with other commodities like copper and oil it’s very bullish for equities.
457 2018-09-09 11:16:58 They definitely had help from a commodities boom. Not that the UK didn't, with North Sea oil...
458 2018-09-09 11:14:54 I hate how we used to just use "in this economy" as some sort of tag line for a bad decision but considering the prices of basic commodities now, it feels like every decision we make is followed with IN THIS ECONOMY ????
459 2018-09-09 11:11:53 As commodities become more expensive, the price of someone's life become more cheap. And it's frustrating that most people choose not to see and hear the evil around us.
460 2018-09-09 11:05:01 For the sake of the citizens of Ph remove the economic manager of DU30 and put some1 can understand the citizens of the Ph. Mostly of them di ramdam ang ginagawa nila para sa bayan, wag nila hintayin ang magalit ang bayan sa sobra taas ng bbasic commodities.
461 2018-09-09 11:01:54 Two thoughts:
1)Interest rates were extremely low for multiple years. Speculation goes rampant during that period.
2)The only market that had massive upside potential was crypto when you compare to equity, commodities, fixed income.
462 2018-09-09 11:01:10 I think you're right, but this deserves more exploration.
- Why have commodities had neg real return in past? - Is this likely to persist in future? - Economic commodities vs gold? - What vehicles for owning commodities (futures funds vs physical storage)? etc.
463 2018-09-09 10:54:58 Poverty is systemic violence under capitalism. It is violence organized by the state so illiteracy, unemployment, famine and deaths will feed higher demand and higher prices to basic commodities for corporations, ensuring their superprofit.
464 2018-09-09 10:43:26 I growth and low inflation will lift people out of poverty. And at the point,  people will never line up for basic commodities.
465 2018-09-09 10:41:25 You know our country is relying some goods source from other country, for example a sustained rise in the price of crude oil or other imported commodities, foodstuffs and beverages and inflation not only experienced in the Phil. but also in other country.
466 2018-09-09 10:40:13 @narendramodi 
For any government petrol n Diesel are kamadhenu cows.since maximum states are run by BJP it's time to change policies to make value based rather percentage based.Keep fixed amount as tax for both these commodities.
467 2018-09-09 10:40:08 Thinking if i should give a letter to my boss asking for an increase since prices of commodities went up hahaha
468 2018-09-09 10:34:28 Where do you get the commodities@ cheaper prices ?Patanjali supply? Baba has also increased the price. I visited the baba shop just yesterday. Don't come to make the ppl fool!
469 2018-09-09 10:24:57 @UsmanAKBuzdar well done sir keep it up .... sir also activate price control commitees to check commodities prices and control unneccessry hype in prices .thanks
470 2018-09-09 10:19:50 Just thinking of how now we're living in a society were everyone has been reduced to entities, units, items, commodities and those that can afford can easily do without or willing let you go for what's new

#justthinking
471 2018-09-09 09:55:47 Be prepared to to shell out more in. everyday commodities and groceries... Diesel touches 80 mark and #RupeeTurns72
472 2018-09-09 09:50:35 Van a bajar las tasas de interés.

Antes que el año culmine las van a llevar a 2.25%.

¿Y qué pasa con el Mercado cuando las tasas bajan?

Dólar sube.

¿Y qué pasa cuando el dólar sube?

Divisas y Commodities bajan.

Ah.

Y el $BTC va camino a los 5K
473 2018-09-09 09:49:31 GDP is the value of All completed/processed/produced commodities in country. If fuel price hikes and the time for completing and producing will reduce or slowed down. So, GDP will decline. GDP is not based on purchasing capacity of people or revenue of Govt.

474 2018-09-09 09:48:00 @Commodities London thanks for the follow!
475 2018-09-09 09:37:28 Fabulous!
476 2018-09-09 09:32:49 Sir, what u say is true, but other commodities are not being affected. The crude oil stabilised but dollar hasn’t. I am no economist, but what I read n know, it will ease out soon.
477 2018-09-09 09:30:10 Fuel prices affects other commodities as well Karan. Worst thing is illogical hike....crude prices stabilised 8-10 days back at approx 68USD. Ppl can afford it yes...but bulk are those who feel the pinch. Chalo...its their call.
478 2018-09-09 09:27:58 You better stop thinking about your crush, and resist the government for not doing anything on the rising prices of basic commodities.
479 2018-09-09 09:25:26 @BJP4India Kaash inhone "Congress mukt Bharat" ki jagah,"Mehngai mukt Bharat" ka slogan diya hota to aaj petrol aur basic commodities itni costly na hoti @INCIndia @RahulGandhi
480 2018-09-09 09:24:00 4 years ago we were paying tax on commodities etc 31% now max 18% barring very few in 28% bracket essentials like Atta rice milk dahi etc tax is 0% still we ask for better days keep Modiji for another 10 yrs things wud be more brighter including fuel
481 2018-09-09 09:23:35 It’s a situation which is alarming but fuel price hike doesn’t really affect too many n the Govt knows that. Most of the people making noise about fuel hike can actually afford that extra bid without issues. It’s the prices of other commodities that matter.
482 2018-09-09 09:20:37 #Petrol at 87.8 ----->>> 100 Coming Soon

Ye Kaun se Din hai ??
Higher Transportation Cost will Drive #inflation of many Commodities..!!
Bad days for Consumers ahead
483 2018-09-09 09:13:05 After a long time, for the right purpose, right people have declared Bharat bandh. A right concerned shown for indians. Against the price hike in every commodities, which simply government is pocketing the money of Indians, showing no results. Only Jumla!
484 2018-09-09 09:11:50 These people don't spare even goats. What to talk of women in hizab. It is no protection from predators from their own community. Females are reduced to just commodities or even worse, animals in burqa. Unless these people learn to behave decently nothing else will help.

486 2018-09-09 08:36:19 The more you consume, the less you live. Commodities are the opium of the people.
487 2018-09-09 08:35:54 Imported commodities like fuel or medicines, or products that depend on imported inputs for their manufacturing, becoming expensive. And Shri @arunjaitley ji you saying nothing to panic ? In what sense you saying not to panic?#RupeeTurns72 @PMOIndia
488 2018-09-09 08:35:12 problem is @BMTC_BENGALURU is also planning to raise fares by 18% because of this fuel price hike!! That is one concern. Secondly, when diesel prices go up, transport costs go up and prices of essential commodities also go up. And car users rarely are stopped by high fuel prices.
489 2018-09-09 08:32:07 So tell us Kiko, bakit ngaw ng ngaw pa rin kayo ng ngaw ngaw if that is the case. Pede po ba tama na ang pulitika, it is high time to tackle the soaring prices of basic commodities.
490 2018-09-09 08:28:44 @republic and their stooges should know - Hate never succeeds. Never. 

What matters to the common man is employment and prices of essential commodities. For e.g., fuel. 

Propaganda will not succeed.
491 2018-09-09 08:23:14 NB in UK economy services play major part so less significant because core elements of 'gravity effect' relate to transport and other such costs concentrated in heavy industry, commodities etc but diminish in consumer and perishable goods, and are almost non-existent in services
492 2018-09-09 08:07:44 Why some idiots shouting so much on petrol prices?

Is that the only liquid they drink?

No one praises govt when prices of essential commodities drop. #Hypocrites
493 2018-09-09 08:00:51 What's is difference between prices of petrol 2013 and 2018 ?

What about other commodities price 
494 2018-09-09 07:43:17 Wrong again brother, because fuel prices have a direct link to the price of essential commodities as it is involved in transporting of goods.This would lead to increase in travel fares too.Fuel is integral to the logistics of all business.
495 2018-09-09 07:41:31 thats right, the river ports were also key, shutting down supplies coming in, and the export of commodities going out, cotton! That was what hurt Vicksburg the most, they were starving us out, union raids taking beef, pork, garden vegs, it got down to eating horse meat, rats,,,
496 2018-09-09 07:19:31 The price of petrol remained the same as it was in 2013. 
—
The prices of essential commodities reduced drastically. Still you are cribbing means what? Look at unbiasedly and objectively
497 2018-09-09 07:13:05 It’s a reflection of mysoginist UK and the view of women as objects or even commodities.
498 2018-09-09 07:02:01 But the one thing is a commodity fetishism. identifying your own worth through commodities around you and putting commodities in a meaningful relation to each other that seems to exist absantly from yourself.
499 2018-09-09 07:00:14 Both oil economies not a fair comparison. #commodities 
500 2018-09-09 06:58:09 Coincidentally, the 2nd World war gave agitators a reason to fight for Independence in Nigeria.Policies such as COLA, Pullen rationing,Tax on commodities etc were catalytic. History will never forget Ransome Kuti,Pelewura/Imoudu/Ijemo people in Abeokuta,Opobo women.

502 2018-09-09 06:51:06 Economy economy,  gas double the price, groceries doubled its price,  health care is on the high side, an average American cannot afford it. Prices of commodities have gone so high, for the past one year, Rent is untouchable.  Give me a break with this economy propaganda,
503 2018-09-09 06:50:04 @narendramodi @AmitShah @aajtak We Strongly need Price Control Authority with only qualified people having no political/judicial background for GST, Petroleum Products, Commodities, Farm Produce, etc. as in current scenario Petroleum companies & mandi authorizes have failed.

507 2018-09-09 06:09:43 Why is no political party highlighting the continuous increase in prices of petroleum , diesel  , LPG , and other essential commodities . The way the rupee is falling against dollar is so alarming . Our national debt would also increase to foreign parties .. where are we heading
508 2018-09-09 05:59:59 Presuming pricing in USD, a NZ exporter will earn more NZD because the NZD value has dropped and the USD is worth more. But that often only adjusts for lower prices being received for dairy commodities.
509 2018-09-09 05:52:46  things stabilising when a tin of beans is $3 there is no fuel. Basic commodities are on shortage. What is stabilising really. What is ?
510 2018-09-09 05:50:40 Also, It is well known when prices of petroleum are increased everyone raise prices of commodities but it never reduces when prices of petroleum are reduced. So govt should act on time rather when situation is out of control. @BJP4India @narendramodi @PetroleumMin
511 2018-09-09 05:44:57 It is heartbreaking to learn these loyal horses - many of whom might have already been sold from family homes when they were too old to be useful - are treated like commodities by the camp owners too mean to pay for them to be euthanased on site. You do great work
512 2018-09-09 05:40:14 People who are doing "WidowCry over petroleum price must have look at other commodities price too. But they won't, We talk for nation too much but won't hesitate to repeat mistake of 2004 type just because Petroleum price has gone 3/litre for time being.

513 2018-09-09 05:08:31 ur sooooo fucking right omg lesbian and bisexual women are not fetishized or treated as commodities by men WHATSOEVER and even if they were EVEN IF THEY FUCKING WERE (unrealistic) u know what would be worse? Making. Fun. Of. Necrophilia. Fanfiction. On. The. Internet. Fujo. Scum.
514 2018-09-09 05:07:57 a little more short term weakness, then I would expect this pair to also turn / its all about EEM/Commodities
515 2018-09-09 05:07:26 Trump Did not inherit a strong economy ..that is total fake news ... donyou work in finance , do you sit on the commodities exchange ?
516 2018-09-09 05:03:29 @CIA World Factbook notes: "Zambia’s lack of economic diversification & dependency on copper as its sole major export makes it vulnerable to fluctuations in the world commodities market & prices turned downward in 2015 due to declining demand from China." China!
517 2018-09-09 05:01:29 I wish our Honorable Prime Minister, and BJP heads to go and fill fuel for their vehicles themselves. Petrol and Diesel are essential commodities. Keeping silent and doing nothing to control the sky-rocketing fuel prices will kill the working class. Please wake up. Do something!
518 2018-09-09 04:54:17 Looks like traditional hedges are not working for the currency markets. Must have run out of Japanese housewives to sell NZD to. :-0 This also suggests that commodities are not the safe bet they once were (presumably because of contraction of demand when surpluses are large).
519 2018-09-09 04:50:09 My question remains what has GMB done in the area of reform that we can say yes.. In 10 years time this reform will bear fruit. From security to power, education and health care.. NHIS instituted under Obj is pretty much dead. No direction on how to move from oil or commodities
520 2018-09-09 04:47:11 First time in Delhi oil prices have gone up,Petrol is now selling @Rs.80.38/liter and Diesel @ Rs.72.51/liter.To Control These skyrocketing prices Government must reduce the excise duty on oils to give relief to the public & have a check on price rise of daily use commodities.
521 2018-09-09 04:46:33 Umm... is like to point out that although the inflation rate is a big factor on the price of commodities, there a ton of the things that affect prices. Among them are prices at the world market, politics, exchange rates, and supply v. demand.
522 2018-09-09 04:40:46 What are our requirements in terms of forex for essential commodities against those exports and please do show us the evidenCe or source which shows exports have increased to that number
523 2018-09-09 04:30:07 Nayabag na, fake news nga mahal na kayng mga commodities karon? Sa bagay, wa man kas Pilipinas nagpuyo for more than a decade. Hilas sad ka da
524 2018-09-09 04:22:57 The hike in prices of different commodities including petrol and diesel after the value of Indian rupee declined has created a lot of problems in day to day lives of common man. @BJP4India does not care about poor people

525 2018-09-09 04:16:37 High Inflation equals higher prices of goods and commodities, wag na tayo maglukohan, kahit 24 hours ka magtrabaho ( tamad lang daw ang nagrereklamo) ang presyo ng bigas tumataas kapag tumaas ang inflation rate, wag maging tanga yan dapat ang bawal:)
526 2018-09-09 04:12:11 I agree!

For one I feel that wealth should be spread more equitably, via a universal basic income perhaps. Externalities, e.g. the negative effects on the environment, need to be priced into our commodities. The government should accelerate our transition to clean energy.
527 2018-09-09 04:00:35 We are living in mature democracy where government work for public welfare by getting taxes from commodities, government services, income, sales, oil and natural gas.
If the prices of oil are consistently increasing in market and still government is silent!!! * dal me kala he

529 2018-09-09 03:57:52 Ironically,the world over it's the political establishment that usually bear's the ire of the people .Here,rising price of essential commodities,falling price of farm produce,lawlessness, intolerance and a dumb and arrogant Govt has unleashed it's ire on a hapless people.
530 2018-09-09 03:55:33 Very high hopes of future when their last manifesto hopes/commitments are not achieved & again no hopes of compliance as petrol/diesel prices shooting every day impacting steep increase in prices of essential commodities,no strategy for  squaring back to regain vote bank please.
531 2018-09-09 03:49:21 High prices of essential 
 commodities is common issue in election as far i know since 1989 but common ppl know its a bogus issue. Now essential commodities are not so precioul. Self identity crisis is dangerous than cosmetic demand.
532 2018-09-09 03:48:04 She must use the same commodities broker that HRC had. One that specializes in cattle futures. Or... she just may be so corrupt that McStain's future is her's as well - she just hasn't picked the "end" date yet or planned her funeral.
533 2018-09-09 03:47:13 The only way mfg of commodities can afford to mfg in US is if US workers were payed $1 an hour or they went to full automation.

534 2018-09-09 03:46:17 @TimesNow  prices of so many commodities have reduced. Opposition and media hyping marginal  petrol diesel price increase to defame @narendramodi ji. Our vote is with Modiji.
535 2018-09-09 03:45:16 É msm... Se ganhasse agora iria dividir o que? Visto que não há mais commodities para distribuir a ermo...

turning to rags and giving the commodities a rain-check
540 2018-09-09 03:02:28 Your dispute is a plain fallacy. Whataboutism. You did not even touch on the fact that prices of commodities are soaring. So again, come up with a better counter argument. It's either a reflection of pure ignorance or a manipulative mind who can't stand the truth about this admin
541 2018-09-09 02:56:20 If you notice the fanatics doubling down with their “what inflation? Hindi mataas ang presyo!” talk points, don’t be surprised. If they’re paid based on output, aba’y kailangan doble effort to afford basic commodities sa panahon ngayon ;-)

545 2018-09-09 02:02:24 So, if a dictator can somehow deliver “affordable & accessible basic commodities & services” then EJKs, political persecution, corruption, the sustained assault on the rule of law, judicial independence, and due process will drift towards irrelevance. Right.
546 2018-09-09 01:56:08 Petrol is act of god. Other two have to be strategised. Among all commodities media overhyped focus on petrol, has practically no major impact on majority of voters, as astute politician @AmitShah has his priorities. Petrol#onion or potatoes.

550 2018-09-09 01:35:28 The same goes for other commodities, such as time. The government says that I need to work from January to May or June to pay for this Utopia. Effectively deciding my time for me.
551 2018-09-09 01:22:20 Precisa muito mais pra mudar esse país do que vender commodities na época  em que a China, nosso principal cliente crescia a 10% a.a .. onde 30% das exportações iam para lá. A partir que o cliente parou de comprar, a realidade voltou. O pobre teve que devolver o carro financiado.
552 2018-09-09 01:05:32 I just got back from a Whole Paycheck in Dallas, and there was much tofu on display. As for silicon and hair-dye, it is entirely possible that we exceed CA demand for those two commodities.
553 2018-09-09 00:55:42 Inflation is a natural phenomenon aggravated by rising prices of commodities in other countries. Its not Sen Sonny Angara's fault
554 2018-09-09 00:16:14 That's a select few fields. There's much more to an economy than heavy industrial products, basic commodities and rockets.

591 2018-09-07 22:26:41 The Senior Director of Commodities says there will be long term indications because of the tariffs. Says that it took 20 years to get the markets back to normal after the last trade wars, and farmers will be relying heavily on the government for a long time.

592 2018-09-07 22:24:37 Was the assertion that Train will have very minimal effect on prices of basic commodities that the DOF issued at the start of the implementation of TRAIN 1 and parroted by Miss Baduy , misinformation or disinformation ?

594 2018-09-07 22:20:43 Never those scumbags! Love you Jim! Really need to know if your club membership is worth it? I traded commodities on the NY commodities exchange for 20yrs! That was in 4 World Trade Center-911 ended that!
595 2018-09-07 22:05:45 Chapter in Capital on commodities are extremely relevant, even more so now than at time of writing, as we now exist in a super saturated consumer-based relation with society/others. That's the first relevance which has actually come more into focus in the last 60 years or so.
596 2018-09-07 21:59:52 I won’t argue with that, but I would also start charting of commodities vs equities starting in 1971, when the dollar became true fiat.
597 2018-09-07 21:48:33 CBI Governor Hemmati: #Iran, #Russia & #Turkey held talks on oil trade, purchase of basic commodities, expansion of banking relations, ditching #USD by using national currencies. Hemmati will later travel to Moscow to finalize agreements.

599 2018-09-07 21:14:13 Agreed with @CaitlinLong_ but to that end, segregated custodial accounts are necessary for digital currencies. Today there is a lot of commingling in both the securities/commodities/banking space for security, price-efficiency and convenience reasons. there are tradeoffs.
600 2018-09-07 21:12:30 "American farm subsidies are egregiously expensive, harvesting $20 billion a year from taxpayers' pockets. Most of the money goes to big, rich farmers producing staple commodities such as corn and soyabeans in states such as Iowa.Feb 12, 2015"
601 2018-09-07 21:09:43 Tough week this week. Started up 4-5% running trades, moving stops to breakeven and reducing risk. Kept me in the game. -0.5% R for the week #trading #forex #fx #commodities
602 2018-09-07 21:06:46 So many Duterte apologists on my social media feed blaming the poor for not being able to put up with the rising cost of commodities. You privileged idiot, don’t you know how many poor Filipinos practically kill themselves just to feed themselves (and their families)?
603 2018-09-07 21:04:49 El viento de cola terminó en 2009. Desde allí hasta hoy hubo un descenso de los precios de commodities. En realidad sabes de lo que hablas?
604 2018-09-07 21:03:49 The reason for our high inflation rate is TRAIN. Higher taxes triggered the increase in the price of vegetables, fruits, fish, meat, rice, fuel, clothing and other commodities. The trade war between U.S. and China is an empty off-tangent excuse.
605 2018-09-07 20:58:33 Desde 2016. Entré en torno a 13, a la vez que otras commodities que fui vendiendo (ANTO, GTE..). Buena compañía, bien gestionada, buenos activos, sin deuda. Ayuda a diversificar, pero alegrías pocas por ahora. No soy muy de commodities, too hard. Ya veremos.
606 2018-09-07 20:52:06 There are no borders when it comes to commodities, they are goods that have no value beyond quality. I would accept an argument about value added goods but the origin of hogs, corn, steel, or cotton is meaningless unless the suits decide to place artificial barriers like tariffs
607 2018-09-07 20:51:47 What can the people do as one to lower cost of commodities?
608 2018-09-07 20:51:11 This is nothing like it will be when the GCR hits. Many of the 50+ folks plan to retire and jobs will be so plentiful for those who want to work. Not to speak of all the buying of houses, cars, and other commodities! Let it happen!
609 2018-09-07 20:48:18 We must listen to Obdna speak...it’s soothing, reassuring and smart. Commodities that are now s distant WH memory 
610 2018-09-07 20:33:06 Real Niggas are Hunted Commodities...
611 2018-09-07 20:27:36 when i handle money stuff i have to remind myself that i literally came up from poverty like, no indoor plumbing and electricity. commodities. so i’m not sorry for fucking up with money all the time. i’m still learning how usury functions in this society.
612 2018-09-07 20:21:56 No es lo mismo un inmueble destinado a circular (commodities de 2 ambientes a estrenar) que la tierra. En Mayo compré un terreno para construir. Nos apuramos en un grupo, porque porque quedaban pocos en ese barrio. Los proyectos que empezaron en Agosto pagaron 20% más en USD..
613 2018-09-07 20:20:00 There is no difference, US made steel has just risen to the tariff level price. Steel is steel, prices are set by quality, not origin and that rule is consistent across all commodities
614 2018-09-07 20:14:52 Thanks you.... perfectly stated, " the degradation of the human spirit"  people are reduced to capitalistic commodities...... not humans....
615 2018-09-07 20:05:32 $VNQ down with rates spiking today on jobs #s. IMO just a spike in down trend. Caveat: Oil/Commodities remain tame (below 70 preferably).
616 2018-09-07 20:03:16 Commodities go up and down.  Just looking for an inflection point.  May be may be not.  I just keep watching.  Long term there is good growth cycle.  Just try to catch the next time it starts to move.  The equities will signal a reversal if there's to be one.
617 2018-09-07 19:59:10 I love your newsletter. I am wondering if you can name anyone who is doing the same thing on soft commodities investing? Thanks
618 2018-09-07 19:56:30 Lastly, inflation is a result of price rises, sure but it is often not the primary reason for rising prices, except when it comes to food commodities. #ProperTaxation may cause some price increases but those are offset by benefits to individuals & society at large. See #Sweden
619 2018-09-07 19:55:43 But isn't that how boycotting commodities works? If they're burning their OLD shoes with the threat of withholding money for future purchases then that's logical even if they're idiots otherwise.
620 2018-09-07 19:54:01 "Scotiabank commodities economist Rory Johnston believes 'that rail is the most bets (sic) way to travel'. This is a drastic change of opinion for Johnston who has highlighted the need for additional pipeline capacity instead a reliance on oil by rail" #OOTT

624 2018-09-07 19:36:25 Lack of strategic training has real world consequences, right?  Just ask the pig-head Nazis.  Two world wars over commodities that could have been acquired more cheaply by trade.  And yet they went to war without sufficient necessary resources. Strategic imbeciles.
625 2018-09-07 19:27:28 Yes, sexism is due to ideology. But such ideology requires immediacy caused by reification; we think human relationships have inherent attributes, like commodities; real change seems incomprehensible and any attempt to move beyond immediacy is seen as pc or unrealistic...

629 2018-09-07 18:59:09 Academics are market-oriented intellectuals whose goal is to turn all human potential into capitalist commodities.
630 2018-09-07 18:55:23 TP, if you really want to debunk inflation scare tactics ng mga dilaw then focus on the formula of how inflation is calculated.  Big chunk of that is due to the tax on sugared drinks.  Most basic commodities are flat or within range of our inflation forecast
631 2018-09-07 18:51:44 Babe, her opponents are already letting her do that. If anything, it means Samson here can put some more attention to the REAL hot commodities.
632 2018-09-07 18:51:38 In both cases the government controls all property, commodities and the means of production.  Both put the society above the individual. Both seem to be dictatorial. One is racist and one will oppress you regardless of your race.

We have fundamental & qualitative analyses for that. Trading ≠ investment.

642 2018-09-07 18:13:31 Important n Notable in the Chart is

Isnt it a result of Good governance?

"Commodity" - a basic good used in commerce that is interchangeable with other commodities of the same type. Commodities are most often used as inputs in the production of other goods or services.

744 2018-09-07 12:59:00 What are the numbers for the non Sm commodities like beef and pork? Alberta in the late 80s had 2400 pork producers. Now probably less than 50. I think beef would be similar but not so small.
745 2018-09-07 12:58:23 Because of volume brought by petrol is far more than alcohol. Anything done with alcohol will cause more problems for some states more than others. eg TN will be far worse off than UP. 
Hence it can be done on commodities regulated at centre and pan India.

747 2018-09-07 12:54:40 Increase the tax on alcohol, increase it on products and commodities that upper middle class and upper class use.  Why shove it on throat of middle class and lower middle class people?
748 2018-09-07 12:54:12 Yes, exactly. I think there may have been artisans who were voluntarily mobile, but I suspect the greater portion of “itinerant” artisans were slaves. In a future article I’m planning to argue that skilled workers themselves were considered valuable “commodities” as it were.

813 2018-09-07 08:16:46 It's more than that. It's a willful disinterest. The had never been a time in this government where an appointment reflected an actual skillset or interest or experience. These are worthless commodities in current politics.

823 2018-09-07 07:21:40 What about food commodities ???
824 2018-09-07 07:18:11 What about the developing world?

China pulled the world out of 2008 recession ramping up debt

What about the commodities producers? 
What about oil?
Who is the biggest oil producer?
825 2018-09-07 07:15:59 He failed to be elected nine times. He was elected as an MEP but failed to attend and misspent his expenses leading to fines. He wasn’t a very good commodities trader either.
826 2018-09-07 07:13:40 It's true  that the prices of essential commodities which are chief needs of commons are available at lower prices than that of previous gov. It's irony of nation , the issues of commons , are being taken by hon modiji gov. seriously are not debated& raised by the opposition.
827 2018-09-07 07:13:34 What about the price of petrol that has nearly doubled and yet we're still paying subsidy?
How about the price of commodities that have more than doubled?
Naira that has lost half its value and yet minimum wage has not been increased?
828 2018-09-07 07:12:12 @BascoPaints Good morning basco paint , please reply to   inboxes but am all-time pleased with your commodities
829 2018-09-07 06:56:48 Absolutely right. It's not religion; it's us vs them in the conflict for commodities. It's otherism. Just like the troubles in Ireland, religious affiliation is just a convenient way to call out the different groups in a conflict that had nothing to do with religious beliefs.
830 2018-09-07 06:54:05 @MiriamLeitaoCom Dizimado deve ter sido seu cérebro, pois a Petrobras sofreu com a queda das commodities como TODAS as petroleiras do mundo, fala sério que 2,5 bis iriam atingir uma empresa desse porte, só pagando a fundos abutres ( sem julgamento ) foram 10 bi.

838 2018-09-07 06:14:38 If Chamisa does press ups, he is inciting violence! If prices of basic commodities goes up or shortages, Chamisa is responsible. If soldiers shoot people, it's Chamisa.

839 2018-09-07 06:11:50 One day, you'd wake up and realize that the law of supply and demand begins to take an inhumane form when supplies for basic commodities like rice and fish go down and thus their prices go higher -- all while wages stay the same, workers remain unpaid and contractual.
840 2018-09-07 06:07:01 True!!! In the period he's been out of the country this socalled president  and his special alalay and spox has never commented anything to assure the public regarding the rising prices of commodities, the high inflation rate, the rice problem....
841 2018-09-07 05:47:15 I’m interested to know how you came up with that number Adam. I think as buyers and sellers farmers need to get a lot better at valuing commodities on a comparative feed value basis.  Protein/ME etc.
842 2018-09-07 05:45:56 you can't say the economy is doing well and therefore we shouldn't worry about inflation.

inflation erodes the ability of millions of Filipinos to afford the most basic commodities needed to survive.

let's check our privilege and ask: para kanino ba gumagana ang ekonomiya?
843 2018-09-07 05:36:03 [COMMODITIES UPDATE] Gold is trading at 1 201-dollars and platinum at 789-dollars per ounce.

844 2018-09-07 05:33:19 Commodities tend to zig, when the equity markets zag.
845 2018-09-07 05:32:59 Hey Zubair. I think it's more the global risk off play. New tariffs kick in, S&P futures sell off and commodities get smacked. Which ties in with your point of a stronger $, so commodities therefore get double whacked. And yes, JSE sells off.
846 2018-09-07 05:26:44 We are only commodities to the machines, they are a heartless greedy evil that will destroy humanity. You're not powerful or smart tech giants!!, you're the composers of the symphony of destruction!
847 2018-09-07 05:22:06 What was the price before?? Is it a local good or imported ..? You can't say it's inflation because you have seen two or three commodities with unbelievably high prices... Zim inflation rate is lower than SA inflation rate... Only that we have more fools in Zim than SA
848 2018-09-07 05:16:53 Its not money, but TIME and ENERGY are the most important commodities that we have because they are NON-RENEWABLE RESOURCE. 

Time spent developing & building healthy relationships is time never wasted. Choose your priorities wisely.
849 2018-09-07 05:16:10 In different countries, the prices of commodities differ and the same is the case with petrol as well. In some countries, the prices keep rising, but in some countries, petrol is cheaper than water.
850 2018-09-07 05:06:39 So are you saying the price issue and shortage of commodities its all fubricated???? If its that so then all cool but then l hope the queues for fuel are also fake
851 2018-09-07 05:06:23 Is this a sign or what...in 2008 there was shortage of bread..petrol and other commodities..pple from budiriro and glenview were also victims of cholera

853 2018-09-07 05:01:59 Its not just EV materials. The threatened imposed tariffs from the US is threatening the growth, which in turn decreases the demand for raw commodities. With China being a major trade partner of Australia, anything that affects China, affects Australia.

856 2018-09-07 04:52:10 Commodities; oil was down for the second straight day, predominantly due to India cutting imports from Iran (in accordance with US sanctions) to zero by November. Copper, gold and iron ore were all up.
857 2018-09-07 04:25:35 Apparently, for the current administration, locking Trillanes in jail is more important than addressing the inflation. Trillanes is more alarming than the rising cost of commodities.

859 2018-09-07 04:14:52 I am not denying the increased prices I feel it too. My simplistic point of reference is the price of a yum burger meal in year 2000.

The government can only mitigate inflation. Even when crude oil prices dipped to historic low, prices of commodities did not go down..
860 2018-09-07 04:13:31 Whenever I feel dumb, I'll just look at my friend's FB posts defending the high-rise of basic commodities.
861 2018-09-07 04:12:54 ang tanong kasi, ano bang maganda n nangyari since your pwesident sat? crimes are committed by your very own police? prices of commodities sky-rocketed? makes their own interpretations of the law? travel galore with shitloads of alalays? asking us to eat bug infested rice? yon b?
862 2018-09-07 04:07:14 Mukhang inflation-proof ang DDS. Dapat yung present prices of commodities ay applicable lang sa 16M na tanga-tangahan pa rin.The rest ng mga Pinoy na nadamay e 2015-2016 prices lang ang i-charge.They should shoulder the burden since they voted for an incompetent lunatic!
863 2018-09-07 03:57:35 I think, even the inflation rate goes down, the price of essential commodities will be never be the same as before. 1 kilo of rice will always be 50 plus.

868 2018-09-07 03:34:59 Inflation in Pinas ... more than 6% ... coz local commodities have price control ... let the law of supply and demand free-flow the price of goods.  Let the market dictate ... not the government setting the price.
869 2018-09-07 03:30:17 change is coming talaga, tumataas ang cases ng patayan sa bansa at ang lahat ng presyo ng mga basic commodities!
870 2018-09-07 03:29:23 Yes, it's possible that the inflation and sudden price increase of basic commodities is not the government's fault. Maybe the global economy is really bad right now. But you know what makes me, or most of us mad?
871 2018-09-07 03:27:50 Exactly! What's worse, the 6.4% inflation rate is just the national average and is felt differently across different areas and commodities. It goes as high as 9% in Bicol and 8.1% in ARMM! Meanwhile, vegetable inflation rate in Cagayan Valley is 35.6%!

902 2018-09-07 01:38:30 Silencing the political opposition such as that of Senator Antonio Trillanes, IV would not solve the rising inflation in basic commodities, the issue of unemployment and underemployment, social concerns, foreign relations issues like the Spratlys problem and the national security
903 2018-09-07 01:32:37 The only thing driving Au & Ag is the USD.

906 2018-09-07 01:19:51 Paid off real estate, gold, silver, other commodities are the only "safe" places to be IMO. Ahead of all of that have a few weeks food tucked away. You can't eat dirt or metal.
907 2018-09-07 01:19:41 Hi, Debra - you think this commodities rally will include oil - or just metals?
908 2018-09-07 01:17:56 No, they’re usually far beyond what’s really needed. But Google, Twitter, and Facebook have been leveraging people as commodities for their own benefit, and they’ve become biased with their Algorithms. It’s dangerous to leave them with no oversight.
909 2018-09-07 01:08:12 ...like putting tremendous tax on instants? Coffees, juices, and the like? Its the only commodities that the poor can buy with their little wages.
910 2018-09-07 01:07:41 You know investments don’t always go good. If one person’s making money on stocks or commodities someone else is losing it. If you live 40 years you’re guaranteed to quadruple the amount. Only way you beat that is if you find the new apple at a couple bucks a share.
911 2018-09-07 01:07:26 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
912 2018-09-07 01:04:02 Drugs muddle up your self-understanding, you become a mushroom suckling on capitalist commodities.
913 2018-09-07 00:56:31 The main argument against tokenized assets like real estate, commodities, etc. is that it still relies on the legal system for enforcement. 

Agree too early for this still, but I believe eventually our legal system will evolve and recognize this new form of ownership.

914 2018-09-07 00:55:11 I am no economist, but  gold and diamonds have held value as commodities throughout recorded history.  Rubies, emeralds & sapphire also have a  history of value over centuries.  Other stones are based more on current market demand making them hard to judge over the long term.

918 2018-09-07 00:29:56 If you earn 6 digits monthly base salary, you don't actually feel it. Take the side from a minimum wage earner, same salary no tax (even before), will make a big impact to their monthly budget. Even I have felt it- the rising prices of commodities and the decrease buying power.
919 2018-09-07 00:23:56 Awful argument if you are aware that: We live in a moment where commodities and crypto are manipulated downward to draw people into the biggest fiat Ponzi scheme in the history of the world.
