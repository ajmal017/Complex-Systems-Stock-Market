7 2018-11-26 23:52:50 I'm no tax expert, but why not tie each company's tax rates to the # of jobs it creates? If the justification for big corporate tax cuts is to "spur" job growth, then those cuts should ONLY go to companies that create jobs, not those that'll use the tax cuts to buy back stocks!
8 2018-11-26 23:52:31 I don't think they should be allowed to buyback stocks at all.  It's stock manipulation.

37 2018-11-26 23:41:49 They keep dropping small stocks. Not sure why
38 2018-11-26 23:39:40 Interesting thought but much of Trump base doesn’t own stocks.  Sinking employment rate might hurt but Trump will blame someone else
39 2018-11-26 23:38:29 I have survived all of the dips in pot stocks since 2016 without my portfolio being too much shaken up, but holy shit this current market is tough on nerves. Have we reached peak fear yet?
40 2018-11-26 23:38:16 I traded stocks and options for 20 years. Last dec 7th right before the US allowed shorting of btc i said i was out of all cryptos. 
Today i see big money truly manipulating the little guy.
41 2018-11-26 23:37:43 GM slashes production and shuts down plants, stocks skyrockets. If this doesnt show you how disconnected the DOW is from real economic conditions, I don't know what will
42 2018-11-26 23:37:37 Well, not too sure, what if OPEC declares a new shale-war by flooding global markets - like in 2013-14? Also they could want to build global stocks now to get ready for IMO 2020...?
43 2018-11-26 23:36:57 @kroyrunner89 Hi Tim. I’m based in New Zealand, and the brokers I have been dealing with have gone into external management. I was wondering if you could steer me in the right direction to find a new broker with a decent platform in which I can trade penny stocks from NZ?
44 2018-11-26 23:36:44 @JuvelaGF are you still making the flakes with red berries breakfast cereal as I can't find a supermarket in Ireland that still stocks them?  :-(
45 2018-11-26 23:36:05 He wants to work for prison reform, fine.  Comparing jail to the plantation?  Were you whipped?  Did they have stocks?  Did you have food or did you it the grub leftover from the master? Were you even part of a chain gang?   Reform would happen if it DID resemble the plantation!!
46 2018-11-26 23:35:25 man I had to sell tesla stocks to pay my rent but I made a small humbling profit cuz I bought it during that joe rogan dip lol ayy @elonmusk can you post a video of you trippin bro so can buy some stocks again 
47 2018-11-26 23:34:57 Thanks to Trump's tax cuts for the 1%, GM bought back stocks at the expense of workers. Fewer jobs, greater profits for stockholders. If you voted for Trump you're a sucker. His buddies stole your livelihoods.
48 2018-11-26 23:33:53 Are those stocks being made artificially high or low?
49 2018-11-26 23:33:35 What % of your net worth is in just these 10. Stocks @rhomboid1?
50 2018-11-26 23:32:48 Well then you had to sell stocks as well in the begin of 2012 and begin of 2016 to avoid the cisises that happened thereafter...
51 2018-11-26 23:32:43 Does anyone know any good apps to view stocks on an apple watch?
52 2018-11-26 23:31:15 Travis, how do we know it is not GM’s greed that is causing the layoffs.  They just got a huge tax break they used to buy back stocks.  Had they tried to expand it may have created more jobs.  But they have cover due to the tariffs.
53 2018-11-26 23:31:12 I’m going to do that with the property we discussed. But completely agree about cash flow. It’s why I’m so serious about getting my first real estate rental under my belt. I have cash flow coming in through stocks, but not nearly enough to where I feel comfortable
54 2018-11-26 23:28:04 GM cuts 15,000 jobs today and their stocks go up 1.72 units ..... they get exactly what they wanted and it’s sickening that all they care about is making more and more money even though they are turning out record profits quarter after quarter .... it’s a slap in the face

59 2018-11-26 23:23:48 Donny is so off base about the economy! It’s starting to slow down. Stocks are way down. Lay-off are coming to industrial giants! Tariffs also bring down the economy. Federal rate is going up. Donny is looking through rose colored glasses then it’s dark!
60 2018-11-26 23:23:21 #TheTrumpEffect 

Buy back stocks, then cut jobs!

 @realDonaldTrump RT @NBCNews: The cuts aren’t limited to the factory floor. GM previously announced it would be using buyouts to eliminate up to 7,000 white-collar jobs. Monday's news confirmed "involuntary separations"
61 2018-11-26 23:23:01 No major corporations should be allowed to buyback stocks. Fixed that for you.
62 2018-11-26 23:22:57 The problem is the number of "good stocks"  is narrow here.  I find it really hard to be bullish on the consumer with the macro environment in place.
63 2018-11-26 23:22:35 Apple Stocks: EXHIBIT A
64 2018-11-26 23:21:52 @jerome_corsi if you’re that good @ connecting the dots and figuring things out please tell us why you’re not picking stocks or winners at the races?  My bet is Mueller pulled your deal - karmic payback is a bitch. Jail awaits you!
65 2018-11-26 23:21:39 That’s it. Must be up to $7 a box  now as cereal prices are like buying stocks from a broker.
66 2018-11-26 23:20:52 No company should be allowed to buyback stocks at all, just like pre 1982 law change would dictate.
67 2018-11-26 23:20:28 im a trained oil analyst and am commended by regulators for exposing AIM fraud, #FRR shares are down 99% since IPO - what qualifications do you have to comment on stocks mr moron?
68 2018-11-26 23:19:51 Canadian, Ont. and U.S. govt bailed out GM in 2008. @stephenharper govt. sells remaining GM stocks to Goldman Sachs at $3Billiion loss to help with budget to get re-elected.Dias stated that this was shortsighted and it gave us no bargaining power with GM. Not saying GM stays but!
69 2018-11-26 23:18:26 i understand the caution but i’m thinking long-term. 

i have a 6% match & i’m 100% vested.  80% is allocated to stocks that i have a feeling will completely dismantle soon. seems like i could hedge by lowering my exposure & transferring to crypto once it hits roc bottom

71 2018-11-26 23:16:50 Haven’t found a single thing to buy on Black Friday or Cyber Monday except for some oil stocks that were 40% off.
72 2018-11-26 23:16:30 There's a history with any stocks.
73 2018-11-26 23:16:03 I appreciate that. There is always room for you! And the good thing is we actually play FAANG stocks/options.
74 2018-11-26 23:15:29 Lol why are you comparing stocks to crypto ?
75 2018-11-26 23:15:10 Remind trump of that the next time stocks plummet.
76 2018-11-26 23:14:51 Bob on the other hand can sell $240-300k of just the stocks that went down, owe no taxes in early years, accumulate loss carry-on forwards, and either enjoy more net income or keep more tax-deferred gains compounding in the account.
77 2018-11-26 23:14:45 Very possible. Apple can be traded on S&P 500, DJIA, NASDAQ. There are other stocks to trade on for profits too; or you mean Apple(fruits)?

80 2018-11-26 23:12:03 G.M. stocks rise to help pull the market out of an abysmal two weeks...on the backs of almost 15,000 employees dismissed and five factory closings. If you think this is Making America Great Again...fuck you.

83 2018-11-26 23:11:41 OD round start and get full stocks and then hit some D specials 

Mash 2CC and feed off of their tilt when you whiff 2C but 2CC auto corrects

Do hammer on wakeup when they get scared of your DP being D special cancellable
84 2018-11-26 23:11:23 This is great news for the stock to plummet around 10-12% tomorrow.... remember people the cannabis stocks are the bizarro world where everything is the complete opposite
85 2018-11-26 23:10:56 Under international law (UN Law of the Sea), we will still have to negotiate with our neighbours on managing fish stocks, agreeing limits and quotas. That won't change if we leave and it shouldn't as it's the only sustainable way to do things.
86 2018-11-26 23:10:55 #HankPaulson, bailed out his former conrade GoldmanSachs out of a $20B hole and kept it secret. Paulson and Obama then had the audacity of giving US taxpayers fake GoldmanSachs Stocks instead of real ones? Can anyone trust him/them? Trust WallSt? Sure. @realDonaldTrump
87 2018-11-26 23:10:53 It is another data point showing stocks go down when worker pay goes up.  That is all it is.
88 2018-11-26 23:09:45 Super-dependent on assumptions, but here goes one: assume two single retirees, Al and Bob, each have US$5M cash in a taxable account. Al buys $5M of $SPY or $RSP, Bob buys the 500 stocks in $SPY directly, average $10k in each.
89 2018-11-26 23:09:38 Does anybody think cannabis stocks will ever recover to their highs? #PotStocks $acb $huge $hip $weed $cgc
90 2018-11-26 23:08:45 Me as well. I’m interested in your algorithms and how you find these stocks. Keep up the great work and thanks for the great content.
91 2018-11-26 23:08:40 Baseline strategy will be long/short, macro, quant or anything you’ll find in a textbook. But that’s just the underlying asset. It goes deeper than buying and just selling stocks.
92 2018-11-26 23:07:23 Gold fell and the Japanese Yen weakened sharply, signalling investors are shifting away from safe-haven assets. In the meantime, tech sectors lead the rally in US shares, while the rise in European stocks may have been driven by optimism as Italy struck a more co-operative stance
93 2018-11-26 23:06:17 it's a shame super-efficient factory trawling has hoovered up fish stocks, and a shame tories sold off so many UK fishing rights #newsnight

96 2018-11-26 23:05:38 @vladstocks I’m having a sell off. Restructuring my whole game plan. I’m only going to invest in stocks with high dividends.....
97 2018-11-26 23:05:19 Yeh mate, because one thing’s for sure, 40 years has done wonders to fishing stocks around the world #takebackcontrol #newsnight
98 2018-11-26 23:05:15 Fishing's been declining for more than 100 years. It's down to overfishing and reducing stocks. #newsnight
99 2018-11-26 23:04:01 That would not work. CEOs are working for profits for share holders. Stock holders. The stocks in your 401k. So you get less in your 401k because the stock isn't making profit margin. So to make margin up price of product to to retain profit. Tax is actually paid by ppl buying.
100 2018-11-26 23:03:00 yeah but cryptos are not stocks though .
101 2018-11-26 23:02:55 Can't speak for $BE, but the rest on that list are silly pump and dump scam stocks
102 2018-11-26 23:02:39 50% of the stocks are owned by fewer than 1% of the population.
103 2018-11-26 23:02:32 Sucks. We all lost out. But if you’re an investor this isn’t the first time this has happened to you. A crash is never a reason to give up, if you’re serious about making money. Houses bubble, stocks bubble, even toy prices bubble. Yet they always come back.
104 2018-11-26 23:01:49 It’s coming! Every single asset class is down, from RE & stocks to crypto.
105 2018-11-26 23:01:49 I heard something pretty massive yesterday. My old mans Banking investment manager told him to pull his stocks and bonds and invest in crypto, gold and silver! He said banks will brake and the shift is coming very soon
106 2018-11-26 23:01:48 buy some stocks
107 2018-11-26 23:01:43 Everything from stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies. Some are even treading on PE territory
108 2018-11-26 23:01:13 @POTUS @stevenmnuchin1 @SecretaryRoss U guys are such idiots. Yes let’s add tariffs on products sent to the US adding a tax on consumers which slows growth and earnings which tanks stocks and confidence.But u get ur extra tax revs on lower sales and thank god don’t get RE-elected
109 2018-11-26 23:00:21 GM just laid of thousands, stocks are down but yeah the economy is thriving
110 2018-11-26 23:00:18 No worries - vets surgeries will probably have larger stocks. Most pet medicines are out of date human ones repacked
111 2018-11-26 22:59:09 I believe it very evil to own an automatic rifle with bump stocks which are of no good use other than KILLING & MURDER.  Keep your pistols at home locked in a gun safe.  The guys at Sandyhook took the weapons right out grand paws showcase gun stash.  Knowing that boy was mental.
112 2018-11-26 22:58:52 Stocks fell already
113 2018-11-26 22:57:44 The online shop stocks replicas, I’m sure they’d give you a nice discount on one.
114 2018-11-26 22:53:15 Already investing in my retirement and starting to invest in stocks. We’re still young but it’s never early enough to be thinking about your financial future friends.
115 2018-11-26 22:52:39 US stocks gained o/n helped by retailers on the back of expectations of blockbuster sales on the largest online shopping day of the year, & tech shares rose after taking a beating last week. Local SPI futures are 46 points higher at 5,724. #ausshares #stockmarket
116 2018-11-26 22:52:08 Kass is a narcissist. He needs constant attention. He really doesn't trade stocks. He just plays on twitter and real money pro all day. when you say to short the S&P nearly every week since late 2009, you dont trade stocks anymore. You're broke
117 2018-11-26 22:51:31 That's why GM stocks went UP today.
118 2018-11-26 22:51:28 well i’d lose far more than half during the inevitable global economic crisis 

i’m currently 80% aggressive growth stocks, large caps, emerging markets, etc
119 2018-11-26 22:51:21 More lies. Under international law, we will still have to negotiate with our neighbours on managing fish stocks, agreeing limits and quotas. If we try to avoid that, other EU countries have said they will reduce their take of our exports (we export most of the fish we catch).
120 2018-11-26 22:49:15 US #stocks have gained, helped by shares of retailers on the back of expectations of blockbuster sales on the largest online shopping day of the year, and as technology #shares rose after taking a beating last week.

127 2018-11-26 22:44:16 $Crypto bubble is officially burst. Some of those $BTC companies like Bitmain, might not even be able to go IPO. 
Next bubble to burst, weed stocks? Weed stocks rallied up huge on prospect of legalization. They are being valued as if there is first mover advantage.
128 2018-11-26 22:43:35 yeah...the same tax cuts that allowed GM to buy back a lot of their stocks so they could what...lay off employees and restructure? So much for supporting American workers for made in American products.
129 2018-11-26 22:43:29 Correct, CK.  Stocks move higher in the long run.  Unless you're a trader, trying to generate cash flow from the vol, tune out the noise.  Maybe 3 or 4 times a strategic move is in order.  My advice to the young right now is to wait for the blood to put money to work.
130 2018-11-26 22:42:41 Holiday layoffs can help company stocks in the next quarter by lowering capital outflows and thus generate investor confidence in the coming year. Look at GM stocks, which increased immediately after announcing plant closing and layoffs.

132 2018-11-26 22:42:28 A little over a hundred years ago California’s government paid bounties  for Indigenous lives. Government-backed militiamen bashed babies’ heads in with their rifle stocks. 

We can be outraged about tear-gassing asylum seekers without being dishonest about our past.

136 2018-11-26 22:39:39 $DJI closed up 354 points today, a very strong start to the week. It is crucial for the markets to continue their growth. If we close negative tomorrow, I foresee that being the nail in the coffin for some, if not most, investors. #investing #stocks #Selloff

145 2018-11-26 22:34:35 Talking bout we buying up the stocks

147 2018-11-26 22:33:43 Well it will be to do with a need of specific fish that aren't in the Indian Ocean and not over fishing in one area so the stocks don't go to low i'd guess

149 2018-11-26 22:31:18 Yeah it was the Tariffs that is causing this

GM and Ford have been happy to blame things on President Trump and look forward to more bailouts from Democrats while they fuck shareholders over again

180 2018-11-26 22:16:07 We should hit them where it hurts and sell off their stock. Ask any funds, especially tech funds to drop Twitter. They bow to the vocal groups who are less likely buy stocks and funds. Like those under 18, college students and those newly into the job market.

186 2018-11-26 22:13:43 While I agree the current valuation of the cryptocurrency market is very low, you can’t compare stocks (that represent ownership) with tokens (which represent a “utility” - in many cases a future one).

But it’s almost certain that increasing the amount of time you hold increases value. (Unless it goes to $0)

3) BS deaths accounted for less than .01% of all gun homicides that year.

246 2018-11-26 21:38:51 Everything you witnessed today was smoke and mirrors. Real test is if todays lows hold. Holding stocks not a good idea anymore. Be liquid
247 2018-11-26 21:37:51 CNBC this morning was like, this rally was lead by tech stocks. Tomorrow, the plunge was lead by tech stocks.
248 2018-11-26 21:37:35 @realDonaldTrump Adam Shiff(sp?) appears to believe that YOU benefit DIRECTLY from sales of military hardware to Saudi.  Time to disabuse him of this idea.  Your off time is real estate, not stocks/bonds
249 2018-11-26 21:35:51 Stocks are equity in firms. They can go up or down for a variety of reasons. Interest rates/bond prices, tax rates, regulations, and individual companies and sectors move in one direction on their own daily.

The stock market is very different than the economy.
250 2018-11-26 21:35:21 #SP500 ends the day up 1.55% YTD return is -0.01% #Dow #DowJones #DJIA ends the day up 1.46% YTD return is -0.32% #stocks #StockMarket #investments #investing #WallStreet #Finance #economics #economy
251 2018-11-26 21:35:15 Bingo. The stocks are doing well and unemployment is low, but if you look at the actual numbers - 50% of ALL wage earners in this country earn $30k/yr or less. This is not an economy that is working for the majority of Americans. Wages stagnant, inflation high, cost of livin high
252 2018-11-26 21:34:50 Depends on how the game goes. Seen lots of actually good 1v1 matches only go like 3 minutes long (3 stocks ofc), I doubt it will be a time issue for PS1. So I'd test it.
253 2018-11-26 21:34:37 Like I said I'd keep a floating total of 5% of my portfolio the rest I'd liquidate and buy funds and solid dividend low volatility stocks to compound my holdings
254 2018-11-26 21:33:31 What planet are you on?  Are you folks so far removed from humanity that you cannot see how we live?  GM gone, Stocks down, President waging war on innocents, people being laid off.
255 2018-11-26 21:33:22 Il y a 4 limites écologiques a la croissance économique :
- L'épuisement des stocks de ressources non renouvelables
- La mauvaise gestion des stocks de ressources naturelles par la surexploitation et la brutale modification des écosystèmes.
- La production de déchets
256 2018-11-26 21:33:18 Trading in GM stocks currently suspended after they announce 5 plant closures and plans to lay off 15% of salaried staff.

@GOP might want to delete their Fox survey tweet earlier today, falsely bragging about how well the economy is doing
257 2018-11-26 21:32:24 There are also more stock indexes now than actual stocks. #CrazyButTrue
258 2018-11-26 21:31:55 So more threats by those who say they are our friends,and he is going to use force in our waters so french fishermen and plunder out fishing stocks,i would soon tell him where he can go,time to send in the Royal navy and protect our fishermen..Let's just leave,sort it out later..
259 2018-11-26 21:30:10 And even worse, Obama forced the transfer of stocks from stockholders to the unions.
260 2018-11-26 21:28:22 Well, even though the risk adjusted return is worse on Bitcoin then for (I‘m guessing here) all major stocks, don‘t higher risk assets perform better on a longer period of time, statistically speaking? (Considering them having been through atleast one full cycle)

262 2018-11-26 21:27:37 Crazy. I'd taken my chances with hands. The death toll would be a lot lower. Ban AR-15s, bump stocks.  I'm not saying ban ALL guns. Let's be sensible. I am not violent, nor are the majority of people. There is no reason to keep giving people a tool that is used for killing ONLY.
263 2018-11-26 21:27:26 Once again, I reiterate, for mom and pop investors, there's no need to own Chinese stocks. Most investors will be heavily weighted in US names and then can own a basic international ETF for other exposure.
264 2018-11-26 21:27:08 How are those stocks goin
265 2018-11-26 21:27:04 Right time to buy some more #AAPL stocks.
266 2018-11-26 21:27:03 Ghanaian stocks did poor this year. That does not mean they'll do well next year, which is the assumption we usually make.
267 2018-11-26 21:26:46 The good thing about #TrumpTarrifs  for Cannabis Investors is that it can be grown locally and never needs  to be traded with Europe or China. Stocks may fall on the news but fundamentally... nothing really changes for us.  

$MMEN $MMNFF $IAN $ITHUF $MPX $MPXEF $TGIF $TGIFF
268 2018-11-26 21:26:16 And? The point is? 20% will be in Chinese stocks. It's a "global" fund so its mandate is to be global. Makes sense. Largest holdings are still US tech giants. Also makes sense as those are the gold standard.
269 2018-11-26 21:25:52 American steel stocks at or near new 52-week lows today:  US Steel $X -3.4% Olympic Steel $ZEUS -2.6% Steel Dynamics $STLD -1.2% ... vs S&P 500 +1.4%.  Remember when Trump boasted his tariffs would save the steel industry?  NO ONE WANTS TO PAY HIGH PRICES!
270 2018-11-26 21:25:21 $AAPL seems like another fake news to me. If proved so, I will blacklist WSJ #stocks
271 2018-11-26 21:25:09 Y'a déjà pénurie de pot dans les succursales, ou pensez vous qu'ils prennent leurs stocks ?
272 2018-11-26 21:25:03 American steel stocks at or near new 52-week lows today:  US Steel $X -3.4% Olympic Steel $ZEUS -2.6% Steel Dynamics $STLD -1.2% ... vs S&P 500 +1.4%.  Remember when Trump boasted his tariffs would save the steel industry?  NO ONE WANTS TO BUY AT HIGH PRICES!
273 2018-11-26 21:24:38 $GM $SHOP $TDD $SEDG $EEFT $BILI $SGH Seeing more and more stocks closing above their 50 day moving average recently. These are just a few.
274 2018-11-26 21:22:15 Hey Thomas Kaine On Stocks... thanks for the follow!
275 2018-11-26 21:21:01 Pot stocks and BitCoin seem to move together .... must be held by the same people? I guess it makes sense, an anti-authority thing maybe.
276 2018-11-26 21:19:39 Yes. Matches themselves are no longer a factor. We assumed it was stocks taken until now.
277 2018-11-26 21:19:26 Rattner rigged the system for the @UAW, gave them stocks in exchange for the VEBA debt, which the UAW sold at a handsome profit. Oddly, though, a mere two years before that transpired, the UAW bragged the VEBA was funded for 80 years. 
278 2018-11-26 21:18:18 Lets see what all we Trump supporters believe
Mexico will pay 4 wall
I won't have time to play golf
I never knew Stormy
I'm a stable genius
I know more than the generals
No collusion
I never knew Matt Whitaker
I love Nancy Pelosi
I will ban bump stocks
Climate change is a hoax.

If you guys go on my shop and see that an item is OUT OF STOCK, don't hesitate to CONTACT ME on my social media accounts or by email! I don't always put all the stocks at once so it's likely I still have the item and can add some stocks on my website! 
281 2018-11-26 21:16:48 World stocks roared back: US +1.6%; Europe +1.2%. Bargain hunters feasted on oversold market as greed overcame fear at least for one day. A day does not a trend make, so investors should be cautious. Fundamentals are still positive even if 2019 earnings grow only in single-digits

Ross went down for shorting a stock he was investigating and Zinke is out soon for something similar. Nevermind Tom Price trading in stocks during his house comm investigation
291 2018-11-26 21:12:11 If prices are down...seems like a good time to buy stocks.
292 2018-11-26 21:12:08 Time to buy GE stocks, mho.

298 2018-11-26 21:09:46 We're very excited to finally have it in! Because the product is new there may still be sporadic out of stocks, but we'll do our best to keep it on the shelf!
299 2018-11-26 21:09:36 Nope, bc the @federalreserve and govt can just buy stocks and whatever else they want when they want to prop it up irrespective of the so-called debt bubble;they NEVER have to REDUCE their holdings. Rather, they merely have to replace them w rhetoric + addl debt sold by govt
300 2018-11-26 21:08:29 Trump is a stock boy. History for him is, how the stocks were in the morning. Therefore his brain can not think further in the future ir present day, and see possible outcome of any situation or risks it holds.
301 2018-11-26 21:08:25 One more observation. P/E ratio is going to be deceiving because all the quantitative easing. If you look at that, it doesn't look like stocks are overvalued, like they were in previous crashes. Probably are, but all relative. There's been no where else to put your money.

305 2018-11-26 21:07:16 @Ocado

Looking at your Cyber Monday deals tonight .. and wish there was some sort of filter to not show: vibrating rabbit, vibrating magic wand, flower vibrator etc etc.

Why not just give surplus stocks to your frustrated marketing team instead?
306 2018-11-26 21:06:27 Lots of efforts to prop the stocks higher...
307 2018-11-26 21:06:27 Great answer. Except it was up 100% in 12 months before it dumped 20%. Guess u forgot that part. Either way mega cap stocks only move like this when thete is a bubble
308 2018-11-26 21:06:00 GM: Guess they're not expecting more auto sales in China with a "win" in trade war.

Nucor down 10% for the year
US steel down 33%
ALCOA down 45%
Chinese stocks down 

Obviously Trump is winning. But who else?
309 2018-11-26 21:05:43 Funny as hell when a dude who owns no stocks points to the stock market as an indicator of health of the economy.
310 2018-11-26 21:04:17 #MarketWrap Major indexes close strong to start new week. DOW +1.46%, NASDAQ +2.06%, S&P 500 +1.55%.

$GM pops 4.79% after announcing plans to cut production
311 2018-11-26 21:04:07 @ReformedBroker you should stop going on Halftime as shows moderator so Negative and makes a mound out of a mole hill, nothing good to say. Some great stocks out they’re on the fundamental basis and he says nothing about them. He’s a downer Man.
312 2018-11-26 21:03:50 All my stocks on website mate!
313 2018-11-26 21:01:31 Tech stocks down 20-49%. Farmers receiving extra supplements due to lack of selling. (None for family farms). Interests rates up over 50%. Housing sales - slowing. 85% of stock profits to rich. Tax savings- to the rich and corps. Highest levels of racial animosity in years.
314 2018-11-26 21:01:23 US stocks bounce back in the Monday session, with the Dow up more than 300 points, and the Nasdaq rising 2%. Tech, retail and $GM shares lead the gains. More on #moneyon1 @NY1.
315 2018-11-26 21:00:34 Où est la cohérence quand vous souhaitez la destitution de notre président pour le bombardement de la Syrie non autorisé par le Conseil de sécurité de l'ONU car la Russie protège la Syrie (bombardement visant à détruire les stocks d'armes chimiques meurtrières)
316 2018-11-26 21:00:05 Oh goody GM stocks are up on the news that 15,000 people are losing their jobs. Merry Christmas
317 2018-11-26 20:59:01 What are the performance dates? And is it a rehearsed reading or full show? X
318 2018-11-26 20:58:56 Can we try some cans please Phil?
319 2018-11-26 20:58:42 @GaelleGD quand est-ce que tu reapprovisionne tes stocks pour que je puisse me faire des yeux de grosse bitch???  Je voulais enfin passer ma commande ! 
320 2018-11-26 20:58:28 Totally out of canadian pot stocks now with the exception of a small position in $wayl. I believe in $acb and $apha long term but gonna wait until the market agrees before reentering. Now 95 percent invested in US plays. Let's get that farm bill passed!
321 2018-11-26 20:58:27 I think oil capitulates for a third time before any sort of real rally. Need to see energy stocks show strength on a day oil sells off before going long
322 2018-11-26 20:57:57 The trend of the spec money has been very well in place for 7 months, going to be hard to change that trend with a billion bushels + or - carry-over stocks...
323 2018-11-26 20:57:53 Bitcoin -15% as stocks make new highs
324 2018-11-26 20:57:42 Thanks! Gotta be nimble. Every time I get wrapped up trying to make a big score this market reverses. Stops are a pain in the butt with options because they are so volatile. I prefer stocks and short ETFs for that reason.
325 2018-11-26 20:57:36 @BitcoinTG For great educational content from 3 amazing traders, @TraderScarface @technical_anal and @Tradermayne , constant analysys of BTC alts FX gold silver and some stocks and some signals here and there aswell. Top quality.

24,621.20
+335.25 (+1.38%)As of 3:53PM EST. 

I think this is a good day for most, but don’t count out the other -5% possible correction move. It’s healthy and provides opportunity on stocks that shouldn’t have dropped due to solid earnings.
327 2018-11-26 20:54:47 It looks like most stocks broke down around October 3,4
328 2018-11-26 20:54:22 Nasty day for MJ stocks $ACB $APHA $WEED $CRON $TGOD $EMH $TRST... where is the inverse Horizon ETF when we needed to short MJ stocks?
329 2018-11-26 20:53:17 These kids always need something out of no where. The amount stocks up
330 2018-11-26 20:53:01 Paying attention to these stocks
331 2018-11-26 20:52:23 Yep Pump and Dump. Get the money in at low cost, make more money in the stocks, cause havoc, and pull it. Watch it crash and burn so the government can take it over and monitor everyone. That was the plan all along
332 2018-11-26 20:51:45 Les 3/4 du prix a la pompe sont des taxes ( TICPE/TVA). Donc une baisse de 20 cts du brut c est 4 ou 5 cts de baisse. Voir moins suivant le niveau des stocks et les augmentations des couts de distribution et de transport. Les prix a la pompe suivent les cours a 2 ou 3 jours.
333 2018-11-26 20:51:45 No, because the #MSM would still be reporting whatever Trump decided to distract them with. For example, right now:
Real wages are down
Trade deficit is blowing up
Stocks are dead
#tariffs are killing jobs
Interest rates are up
Home sales are down
but no one talks about it..why?
334 2018-11-26 20:51:03 Stocks came out to play today
335 2018-11-26 20:48:26 lol anxiety teally had me not checking my stocks for like a month smh fumbleton
336 2018-11-26 20:47:30 buying crypto I think would lose you money. I've seen stocks that depreciate into irrelevance and I see the same thing happening here.
337 2018-11-26 20:47:19 @ComfortExeter do you still need stocks for your comfort packs as I have a collection going on!
338 2018-11-26 20:46:52 Looks like this will be the lowest equity volume for a full session in the month of November. 

Low volume remains the only canvas that stocks can rally on, so it's good that bulls didn't waste the gift.
339 2018-11-26 20:46:34 así a voz de pronto me he dado cuenta de que en España son 3 contados los que hacen intradía con stocks, la mayoría 99% índices.
340 2018-11-26 20:46:33 I sold out of all stocks on 11/13.  I’m convinced we are going below 19,000
341 2018-11-26 20:46:29 Learning how to trade stocks and currencies is giving me a headache 
342 2018-11-26 20:46:16 Not that this is worth the time, but if you go back to when he starts pumping stocks. It is during the dump phase. So he can’t even be successful in pumping or front loading like he claims. He had the opportunity to drop a screenshot and shut me up. But he wouldn’t/couldn’t! Lol
343 2018-11-26 20:46:07 The article said they were doing it so they would not have to sell stocks.
344 2018-11-26 20:45:44 Looks like its going to continue to consolidate, then move lower. I cannot see how these insanely priced weed stocks are going to maintain their valuations once the market drops and people get squeezed. This is going to $40
345 2018-11-26 20:45:34 $SPY BLOCK TRADE [15:45:28] @ $263.37, 502,345 shares. $ES_F $SPX $SPXL $SPXS $SPXU $UPRO #stocks #investing #trading
346 2018-11-26 20:45:34 I really like #Apple products. Stable, reliable, durable. Nevertheless, the fall of the #stocks was predictable and is warranted. Not just because of the price policy. Oversaturating the market has become more important than perfecting their products. That's not "the Jobs way".
347 2018-11-26 20:45:23 Stocks up again, mark
348 2018-11-26 20:44:58 Killing the oil industry doesn't help. Canada is now a bad place to invest. I have been warning everyone to get out of Canadian stocks for a year now and I was right. If you can, see what is happening you are blind

351 2018-11-26 20:44:27 My Stocks Wayyyyy Up, I Cant Just Fck Anybody.

$AAPL
$BABA
$BIDU
$BA
$AND
$SPY
So this week should be nice
353 2018-11-26 20:42:09 Given we’re repeating 2013-16 term so far (GDP in 2013-14 same as 2017-18 - 2.8% with YoY both at 3.1% at this point), next 2 years probably repeat with rising wages but slowing GDP.

He will just switch from stocks (2017) to GDP (2018) to wage growth (2019 probably) to tout.
354 2018-11-26 20:41:46 Yeah, this great economy and about-to-be record setting Christmas season is gonna be sooooo bad for stocks...
355 2018-11-26 20:41:15 There is no excuse for our people to be at the bottom. I am trying to get a 2nd job so I can invest in stocks and bonds. You gotta start somewhere before I can think about real estate. Generational wealth is why the Kardashians and Trump clan are winning
356 2018-11-26 20:40:28 Trading of GM stock on the NY Stock Exchange has been halted. Probably saw that it is plummeting and wanted to avoid a wave across the entire auto industry stocks. #StockMarket
357 2018-11-26 20:39:30 Stocks bounce back as tech, retail and banks jump
358 2018-11-26 20:38:14 While others party at Mello  I’m still counting how many reds I’ve got today . Well it’s a poor start to the week down 0.5% MCL TOT AIEA and BILN the main culprits. CAU CSSG and HYDG the only  stocks. Results at SYS stated confidence in meeting FY forecasts. No trades today
359 2018-11-26 20:38:06 man, we need some good news, Cdn pot stocks all getting hit hard again today
360 2018-11-26 20:37:55 Stocks fine today...it’s okay...no body knows wtf is going on in these markets one day from the next...
361 2018-11-26 20:37:32 Sometimes, contrary to all those silly conspiracy theories, its not the Fed or the Govt, but the Free Market acting in anticipation of a recession, pulling credit, moving money from stocks to bonds & T-bills, that hastens the recession.  QED.
362 2018-11-26 20:37:21 within the next year i want to be able to learn how to code, get a basic handle of statistics and get started with investing in stocks. ain’t nothing better than learning new things 
363 2018-11-26 20:37:15 World stocks rise on politics and holiday retail hopes
364 2018-11-26 20:36:39 With teens fleeing #facebook, in the future the only companies that will market on their page are #bigpharma cause only #babyboomers who just discovered social media will be left...(tgj) #cdc #hippa #bearmarket #healthcare #hospital #doctor #nurse #stocks
365 2018-11-26 20:36:23 Overall, it’s a smart strategy to own both stocks and real estate, if possible. Attribution of the gap only to home ownership is as nearsighted as saying no investment in the stock market is part of the gap either. Both entail ownership, which is the reason for the gap in wealth.
366 2018-11-26 20:35:35 What do you think would happen without regulation and quotas? Stocks would be gone in a few years and then no jobs at all...

376 2018-11-26 20:33:19 Stocks are falling after a decade of economic growth, economists are worried about rising monopolization, war tremors in Europe (Ukraine imposing martial law), this is not like the early 1930s AT ALL.

449 2018-11-26 19:56:43 $MNGA is a CRAZY volatile stock. Reminds me of small cap pot stocks in January. Difference is I'd argue that it's overextended to the downside (it was a $6 stock a year ago), rather than the upside.

502 2018-11-26 19:32:54 Why cuz it's bad publicity to see GM stocks soar while thousands lose their jobs? Amazing indictment of the current state of capitalism.
503 2018-11-26 19:32:40 The calculation of margin is not taking in account of the stocks holdings this is the ticket 2330006 all the account pictures are attached
504 2018-11-26 19:31:44 Viewers would rather watch May, Corbyn and Rees-Mogg put in the stocks and be pelted with rotten fruit.
505 2018-11-26 19:30:44 Wow, if only the same effort would be put into declining salmon stocks and relocating salmon farms away from natural water bodies.

509 2018-11-26 19:30:31 I own stocks in many companies but I'll be damned if the corporations I "own" and make money off of my investment in them is going to earn the privilege of telling me what to say, think and do with my beliefs.  How is this different?

512 2018-11-26 19:29:09 But this is a natural outcome of fractional banking and fiat currency.  When banks started taking deposits and lending out the money, leaving only a fraction of the money, they invented fractional banking, and paper wealth creation.  Stocks and bonds, same thing.  ->
513 2018-11-26 19:27:21 It happened to me twice under Bush. I moved everything I had in stocks out. The gains are too short lived if you can't control it day-to-day. 45 cares about no one's money but his and the Saudi's.

Blah  Blah
Trump is pushing us into a major recession 
Too much spending on tax cuts for billionaires 
GM is laying 15 % of their workers closing 5 plants 
A reckoning is coming
Stocks are starting
To  tank.

(Je ne rigole que très peu comme toujours)
523 2018-11-26 19:20:43 And now a serious question: given there's a world of excellent non-US stocks in your kind of style that the US investor won't have easy access to and would really benefit from purchasing via a US listed vehicle, why don't you do an international version of CWS?
524 2018-11-26 19:20:14 Same but I would buy a massive chunk of their stocks and haul it home raining cheeseburgers
525 2018-11-26 19:19:34 There will be a run on bad eggs and rotten tomatoes everywhere. It would be rather ironic if they were unwanted food bank stocks.
526 2018-11-26 19:18:51 @Tom_Stocks It was amazing to Meet you on saturday
527 2018-11-26 19:18:44 Eddy, I'm sure no one ever asked you this: given you rebalance once a year, there are few known positions and they're all liquid US stocks, why should a client buy CWS?
528 2018-11-26 19:17:23 stronger dollar + 200bn in treasuries issuance = negative for stocks it is going to be interesting to see what happens tomorrow.
529 2018-11-26 19:16:59 Kinda hard to do though. They can afford to get around everything.

Only thing that seems to work is shaming them on social media causing their stocks to drop.

531 2018-11-26 19:15:17 Born in Youngstown. Sad that many companies took their big tax cut, bought back stocks, didn't pass it on to employees in wages and then cut jobs. Not just manufacturers- Wells Fargo announced up to 10% work force reduction the end of September.

534 2018-11-26 19:13:26 I've noticed that my asda in Kilmarnock only sells 3 or 4 . I go in every morning and have to hunt everywhere between the rows of #sun newspapers for a copy. Surely fair sales should mean equal stocks?
535 2018-11-26 19:11:55 Basically, there are two forms of financing a business: Through Equity and Liabilities. The former is like stocks, ownership, how economies have worked forever. Liabilities are basically borrowing money on interest and buying above your current equity. This has a lot of effects.
536 2018-11-26 19:11:23 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
537 2018-11-26 19:11:01 In the 1920's, the Stock Market became less regulated, people were able to buy stocks on margin (borrowing money), the market grew three fold, 80% of Americans bought everything on credit & few had any money in savings, inventories grew, then came 1929. Sound familiar? #MAGA
538 2018-11-26 19:09:43 Destroy the value of a company, buy the stocks cheap,take control and reinstate. 
That's how you own it!
539 2018-11-26 19:09:36 During the festival season, there is the looming threat of yakisoba sets reaching low stocks.
540 2018-11-26 19:09:25 if i remeber correctly i once read that there was a similar situation regarding trusts and stocks in 1929
541 2018-11-26 19:09:24 Well the #trump bubble is over.  My stocks are all back to where they were before he came into office....Now the downward spiral...
542 2018-11-26 19:07:59 $Vix and $Yen confirming, bonds not.
I guess sooner or later bonds and stocks will move up together, might even be now. So i would say the coast is clear for the rally to continue
543 2018-11-26 19:07:40 @realDonaldTrump @marcorubio @RandPaul great tax cuts for American Corps. GM cuts 15 thousand jobs and closing 4 plants in USA.    trickle don economlcs always works. Stocks go up.
544 2018-11-26 19:06:38 Are razor-wire stocks and tear-gas stocks up ?
545 2018-11-26 19:06:06 Not until the charade is impossible to deny. Maybe we're getting close with bitcoin, but have a long way to go for stocks.
546 2018-11-26 19:04:21 Lost 3$ in stocks today. It's true what they say...you could lose it all at any moment.

548 2018-11-26 19:03:34 I think they should bring back the stocks... and put May in them while all us citizens of nowhere tell her where to stuff her deal. Bet she wishes she’d been a bit nicer to us now...

556 2018-11-26 18:59:29 Amen, Brother! Think long term, not short sighted. Setup goals and objectives. You MUST have a strategy as a seasoned investor. Hope is something that hasn’t happened but you wish would, and you can’t make it happen by any means legally. If all your stocks made money it’s reality
557 2018-11-26 18:59:08 I’ve been a shareholder of MoviePass and let me tell you that Ted Farnworth and Mitch Lowe doesn’t give a crap about their company.  The stocks is at a all time low and it’s about to be delisted.  How that for this pathetic company.
558 2018-11-26 18:59:00 both stocks and crypto rallying today is an interesting correlation.
559 2018-11-26 18:58:42 After consideration, I’ve decided to dump my #aurora #cannabis stocks.  Too volatile.

566 2018-11-26 18:54:24 There is much debate currently in the UK about the Common Fisheries policy. As an expert on marine fish population dynamics what is your view on the best means of managing fish stocks that move across national marine boundaries during their lifecycle?
567 2018-11-26 18:53:57 The rich buying stocks doesn’t trickledown to more jobs unless they are buying stock in IPO’s or Startups. If you buy stock in an existing company you are trading cash for stock another rich guy owns. No job is created. You have suckered by the GOP scam again.
568 2018-11-26 18:53:34 That’s why stocks are for institutions, not humans. Every human long stocks for 1900 got cashed out.
569 2018-11-26 18:53:31 The stock markets started strong today for the first time in weeks. Maybe everyone just needed to get through Thanksgiving. #Stocks
570 2018-11-26 18:53:17 I like to think of Twitter DM’s as stocks. Once you send one you have to be comfortable with the possibility it’s a total loss. However, sometimes you make a good call and see profit.

581 2018-11-26 18:48:31 Why you so mad? Buy at $19k? If you don't like it fine, let others play, stick to stocks and metals. Don't be such a baby about it.
582 2018-11-26 18:48:22 It's so convoluted. And especially when they claim different things but they're not what they seem on the surface. They have stocks in companies that make war weapons and other stuff like that, when they would let their members be imprisoned for refusing to be drafted.
583 2018-11-26 18:48:04 in passing. And certainly at a time stocks are moving and interesting I guess I find cryptos to be of much less interest.

630 2018-11-26 18:22:04 #MondayMotivation   Is the stock market also a referendum on Donald Trump's fitness as an economic leader.? If so, shouldn't everyone be out of stocks and into long-term bonds and precious metals until DJT is out of office? Or do we all stand firm and go down the toilet together?

633 2018-11-26 18:19:07 Yes but today's reversal was very good from support in many stocks and indices so a bit cautious

639 2018-11-26 18:14:33 I personally believe all the moves Trump does are to help his stocks and to enrich himself. Because only thing he cares about is himself
640 2018-11-26 18:13:43 Selling is such a harsh and cheapening term...  All stocks are winners, it's just that you can lose everything in some of them..

642 2018-11-26 18:13:04 With the passage of a ballot proposition and a state law in 1966-1967, PERS was allowed to invest 25% of its portfolio in stocks;
643 2018-11-26 18:12:19 I think the juice is gone when we hit 2.5-3% interest rates. Maybe slightly higher. There will be manufactured volatility until then. Once the market isn't used like a bank anymore (higher dividend paying stocks) conservative will move to bonds and risk will move to crypto (IMO)

717 2018-11-26 17:45:34 If you overlay a chart of Bitcoin $BTC with one a year later in #CannabisStocks it is eerily similar. Not saying it continues but something to look at.

767 2018-11-26 17:25:34 It would be inappropriate of me to do single stocks here. Too many ways to get into legal and, or ethical problems. Sorry.
768 2018-11-26 17:25:33 Are you saying that @RSPCA_official both recommend and endorse an illegal activity? 

Meaning that anywhere that stocks their @rspcaassured products are breaking the law?

771 2018-11-26 17:24:31 The ship likely started plans to leave the dock when Harper bailed them out with billions without an agreement to stay in operation long term. Did his selling of our GM stocks to Goldman Sachs (at a huge loss for Canada) play into this too?

776 2018-11-26 17:22:44 you know what might be a worst case scenario for Millennials?  They hated stocks after the GFC so they sought out Crypto.  Which then imploded (and they missed a big run in equities) so as they leave crypto it may push them back to stocks which are late cycle...
777 2018-11-26 17:21:50 To clarify, are you using two different forms of the word “trade” here?

781 2018-11-26 17:21:16 stocks can be very long term investments. 30-40 years of good returns are not uncommon if your willing to hold during the inevitable ups and downs. but the words "Never sell" should never be uttered when discussing any investment
782 2018-11-26 17:21:12 People keep talking about how well stocks are doing but not seeing the inflation rate increase we’re going to collapse within 4 years

788 2018-11-26 17:18:25 I think Fed's best bet now is to keep $USD strong so investors seek US Treasuries while the rest of the world blows up. That's probably the best they can do. Will involve stocks cratering, but when the alternative is loss of credibility there's not much they can do.

799 2018-11-26 17:13:28 Very very interesting; interest rates will continue to climb through spending more money while increasing our federal deficit as corporations make more money. If Stocks decline by another 2 points, we're in recession territory & the economic downturn with tariffs will be huge.

878 2018-11-26 16:48:15 Beginning to see some Wide Moat Buffett type stocks for sale.
Buffett likes companies with high brand loyalty, pricing power and massive switching costs. Allegedly he looks for a double in 3 years or 24% annualized on any new investment, even though he holds for much longer.

885 2018-11-26 16:46:07 $SPY the market is not just AAPL. Plenty of opportunity in stocks like CELG, MS, HXL and the rest of the financials + airlines are good buys. Just because AAPL goes up or down does NOT indicate bear market. You're panicking!

905 2018-11-26 16:40:14 #crypto continues to fall, and the #stockmarket is doing the same.

Right now doesn't seem like a good time to invest. Better to kill debts and save.

That is, unless you have no debt and your savings are good. Only in that case, buy crypto/stocks.
906 2018-11-26 16:40:07 Hold very little cash. Inflation benefits you because all your stocks, real estate, etc. go up in value much more than inflation (throughout history). Poor don’t have access to cheap loans so they’re not benefiting. Rich w/ access to cheap leverage benefit much more.

915 2018-11-26 16:34:10 Also have to wonder how many bought those stocks at fire sale prices in 2014 when GoC sold off a bunch of them at a loss.
916 2018-11-26 16:33:43 Many articles said GM closing plants lead the stock to go higher. They don't understand a US-China trade deal is very likely to happen soon. That's the real driver behind the rally for a lot of stocks, including car companies. Closing plants itself is negative long term.
917 2018-11-26 16:32:51 The thought of stocks for the poor man... allow me to take you dollars, and give you pennies in return. Maybe.  Pennies relative to the investment.

1010 2018-11-26 15:54:56 It's beginning to smell like Fall, 2008. It's time to play move your money out of stocks, for those who are still playing. Just move to stable value funds, which I did and while everyone on my work floor took a dive in 2009 (some lost 1/3), I made 10%. Republicans are losers.

1024 2018-11-26 15:48:49 Stocks reacting positively to news about cutting jobs is one of the great market fallacies to me. Another way of reading it: the company was unable to generate work or make the best use of the in-house potential. GM today is a prime example.

1129 2018-11-26 15:00:28 Ce n'est pas une simple entreprise d'expédition, ils gèrent des stocks  comme Costco. Costco n'achète pas la plupart des produits qu'il vend, ils sont en consignations et payent les fabricant si la vente se fait, sinon c'est retour au fabricant.

1225 2018-11-26 14:22:37 Gold to stock ratio is at a low (stocks are expensive) and gold to silver ratio is 80+ (silver is cheap in relation to gold). Majority of silver miners can’t pull it out of the earth for less than current price. Silver is a buy. Physical...not that paper/digital stuff!

1232 2018-11-26 14:17:02 Core point is about huge divergence in valuations. A very small % of stocks continue to trade higher whereas the vast majority has witnessed a significant decline. As a result Sensex/Nifty still manage to show + YTD returns despite the fact that most portfolios are in deep red.

1235 2018-11-26 14:14:40 for those stocks with daily 5ma still sharply downwards, ONLY thing to look at now is whether/when this 5ma changes direction to turn upwards or at least turn flat. then we can talk about weekly chart. but this 5ma direction on daily is FIRST thing to look at.

A 2nd hand Ultimaker 2+ sells for roughly the same price as buying a new Prusa MK3, and releases me from buying any more 3mm filament since it’s only for the UM2+ (a lot of my usual suppliers are killing their stocks of 3mm)

Worth the swap?

1260 2018-11-26 14:05:33 I think the expression is "store of value" which is not the same thing as wealth. Wealth can be held in currency form or in the form of stocks and bonds, land, fine art, and the like. But these don't have purchasing power in the same that currency does.

1377 2018-11-26 13:04:43 I don’t see @RevShark calling a bottom, just pointing to support of those stocks that have been hit most. Many tech stocks have cut 20%-30% in a very short period of time, during mostly positive earnings reports and an outstanding economy. That combination is an anomaly.
1378 2018-11-26 13:04:37 Also it's funny how you self-fellating incels are all indignant about sex workers earning small untaxed tips online but you don't care about the fact that the gov. taxes stock options at a lower rate relative to income in the U.S. Rich people earn most of their $ from stocks, btw

1387 2018-11-26 13:01:40 Depends on what they own stocks in, doesn't it? If it's something that they will have to deal with deciding the fate of in the future (like social media, pharma, etc), then absolutely dump those stocks for a portfolio they won't be legislating.

1511 2018-11-26 11:34:29 Stock market
A stock market or equity market is the aggregation of buyers and sellers of stocks, which represent ownership claims on businesses; these may include securities listed on a public stock exchange, as well as stock that is only traded privately.

1512 2018-11-26 11:33:09 Stock
The stock of a corp is all of the shares into which ownership of the corporation is divided. The shares are commonly called stocks. A single share of the stock represents fractional ownership of the corp in proportion to the total number of shares.

1612 2018-11-26 09:41:55 If you are biting your nails about #crypto bear market, you did not follow first rule of #investing. Do NOT play with money you are not prepared to let go. That is a valid point in any kind of market. Stocks, Gold, Crypto, Forex...Maybe it will recover, maybe not, but stay calm.

1623 2018-11-26 09:30:08 Oil prices falling because the Fed is draining liquidity from the market to pay back the $4.5 TRILLION QE debt they created 2009-2014. Assets (oil, stocks, treasuries) must be liquidated to offset Fed drain. If this continues, we'll enter a bear and all the idiots will blame you.

1629 2018-11-26 09:25:38 How to be more aggressive trading:

Holding leveraged index ETFs during uptrends

Holding a bigger percent of capital in the strongest stocks

Trading with in-the-money options

Being more aggressive holding winners, letting a trailing stop take you out instead of a profit target

1781 2018-11-26 07:05:19 It was the UK that pushed for quotas because they, rightly, saw that fishing stocks were getting dangerously low. Sadly it was the UK that then sold the quotas for short term profit at the expense of the UK fishing industry. Fishing industry has no one but the UK to blame.

1805 2018-11-26 06:48:52 Instead of arguing for ETFs over individual stocks we should be arguing about how long to hold individual stocks and when to take profits.

1847 2018-11-26 06:10:06 I actually no genius but I’m pretty sure from what I’ve learned in school so far is that the “Change” rounded up and put into stocks goes into penny stocks? Is that correct?

1891 2018-11-26 05:24:17 @LDrogen One has to remember that 50% of stocks fall 80% or more after a major top and this keeps repeating all the time. They then need to be up 5x just to come to prior high.  Buy and hold can be perilous without a superstock! Wonderful analysis!
1892 2018-11-26 05:21:30 The most shallow analysis.

1961 2018-11-26 04:12:56 Japanese corporations and corporate governance are perfect! That's why there are continuous scandals, and the stocks of Japanese corporations are traded by investors on stock markets at such low multiples of assets and sales.

2056 2018-11-26 03:05:01 JD, Always reminds me of the Great Recession and housing crisis. If someone was sitting on the sidelines with cash and bought stocks and real estate they made a fortune the last 10 years.
2057 2018-11-26 03:04:58 Boyce, what advice you give us on stocks to purchase and or look at?
2058 2018-11-26 03:03:13 4) Look at current FAANG and other tech stocks as of late. Do you stop believeing in Amazon w a 25% drop as of late? Don’t disregard $BTC w the current drop. We know $ will become digitized in the future whether thru tokens or some other form of digital transformation.

2065 2018-11-26 02:56:06 The stock market works on speculation too. Anytime there is an election stocks decrease because of speculation that dems might take control. If they do they pass more regulations costing companies. Speculation

2068 2018-11-26 02:54:32 Ok. Thanks for the advice. Good luck with that chart. Never seen one that lies yet...but there is always a first time for everything. Back in the dark ages, the smartest guys in tech were touting internet stocks too. Then March 2000 happened, and they weren’t so smart anymore.
2069 2018-11-26 02:54:26 Why do you insist? Why not just put them in stocks in the public square already? Personally I'd prefer that we not turn into the type of monsters we're trying to fight.

2071 2018-11-26 02:53:21 If you were an investor, you would see the trend. Anytime dems win the stocks decrease. This is because dems cause more regulations costing companies more. The stocks increases and decreases on speculation of what will happen.

2089 2018-11-26 02:35:58 bc YG is really desperate financially right now. Their stocks are dropping roller coaster, the concert tickets are not selling good. They need to show off something to their stock holders to prove something ASAP. And that's when this pathetic media play kicking in.
2090 2018-11-26 02:34:52 As of 10:30 a.m., PSEi 7,380.81 up 40.63 points or 0.55 percent. #PSEiupdate #PSEi #stocks
2091 2018-11-26 02:32:20 You wouldn’t know. Watch HYG. It’s a junk bond ETF. Strong correlation to stocks.
2092 2018-11-26 02:31:41 see what it does into the 10 ema.  But I'm anticipating a 2015 type market and looking to short the type of stocks that did poorly in that environment.   I'd rather short stocks with less recoil.
2093 2018-11-26 02:30:12 Also company just had all notes/debt paid by new CEO in exchange for restricted shares. Trading very thin, and no dilution. Could pop again

2096 2018-11-26 02:28:28 I remember teaching my soon-to-be friend how to play Marth and my very first tip for him was "Use Dancing Blade as much as Cloud uses up air" and he started taking stocks and games infinitely more
2097 2018-11-26 02:27:50 @sable2405 awesome analysis on markets and stocks.
Although he s busy man due to work obligation but have fine grained on markets.
2098 2018-11-26 02:25:22 Stocks in Asia opened mixed and U.S. equity futures rose as markets appeared to take a breather after the recent sell-off.
Shares in South Korea edged up, while Australian and Japanese equities fell. Futures pointed to a lower start in Hong Kong.
2099 2018-11-26 02:24:19 Stocks just went up 
2100 2018-11-26 02:21:35 "You can't speculate on the price" LOL. We do it all the time. Stocks, commodities, real estate, even foreign exchange rates.
2101 2018-11-26 02:20:39 Listen I told you this before I got hooked when I made a 350 k on CDE back in January 2016, amoung other PM stocks. I don't need a pumper to get my mojo going but just because currently the dollars king, everything I'm seeing leads me to real money. To me gold silver .

2111 2018-11-26 02:11:07 The reason the wealth gap keeps growing for #blackpeople is because we don't invest in the stock market.  Wealthy families, almost without question, are heavily invested in either real estate or stocks.  Many of them even start with nothing and their kids die as millionaires
2112 2018-11-26 02:10:46 Asia markets are better off today morning as energy stocks declined after oil prices fell to their lowest levels in more than a year last week.
Nikkei is higher by 101 points

SGX Nifty is higher by 12 points
2113 2018-11-26 02:09:47 Market futures are trading strongly in the green, positive by about .35% so far. Asian markets are also trading strongly in the green thus far.

2119 2018-11-26 02:03:29 Your claim is, Trump's policies only benefited the super rich.  But if 16% own stocks they too are benefiting from a growing stock market which makes your claim false.

2121 2018-11-26 02:01:49 That's perfectly fine. We do not have to agree.
Moreover I have not blamed anyone for Advising investment in the stocks mentioned but have just mentioned a phenomenon. There is a difference.
2122 2018-11-26 01:59:55 Yes.  Falling falling falling exactly like stocks and bonds. Thanks porky.
2123 2018-11-26 01:59:53 FANG stocks, crude, iron ore, BTC.
2124 2018-11-26 01:59:51 More than likely, but may not do it in one day... let's find out!  If it is strong, go with longs that make sense.  I post a daily #GamePlan that has some solid go-to stocks that you can look at if the market is moving up or down.
2125 2018-11-26 01:56:27 He poured a lot of money into BP for recognition in the US when his stokes were already down. Risky move as if it doesn't pay off and stocks keep going down he has to answer to the Board of Directors
2126 2018-11-26 01:55:25 So tear gassing women and children are fine in your book? What the hell is Trump holding over you, a year ago you were for America and the constitution. What happen? This country is falling apart. Deficit rising, stocks falling, what’s your excuse? Why have you sold yourself?
2127 2018-11-26 01:54:24 November 26, 2018: As of 9:45 a.m., PSEi 7,336.92 down 3.26 points or 0.04 percent. PSEi opened at 7,352.29. #PSEiupdate #PSEi #stocks
2128 2018-11-26 01:54:11 Yes I agree, this boils down to what type of market you are in. Crypto is a traders market, small cap penny stocks or stocks that do not have major portions of shares owned by institutions are likely to be traded similarly. The use of fundamental catalysts would add to any case.

2137 2018-11-26 01:44:43 Short sellers also perform a necessary function in the market to limit damage of cancerous companies. Not to mention they should be the best friends of investors that want to buy stocks cheaply. Yet you claim to be an investor and at the same time blame them which is irrational
2138 2018-11-26 01:43:48 Don’t come at me with no teeth in your mouth, a receding hairline, or a limp peeper with a proposal...

2149 2018-11-26 01:33:08 You know, he claims to be a “performance artist.” 
(In an Everything is Aweful podcast from August.)

And he’s banned from trading stocks & stuff like that for life. Go figure. 

Finally, he tried to orchestrate a frame up of sex assault charges on Mueller & got busted. 
2150 2018-11-26 01:32:59 Khashoggi was a Muslim Brotherhood lapdog his demise was happening one way or the other. If Trump is able to bring the cost of oil, he reduces inflation which is incredible to the world economy especially the US (bad for my stocks). Remember Muslim brotherhood isn’t our ally.
2151 2018-11-26 01:32:14 Agree always cautious in this market. Each to there own I guess, I prefer buying stocks in strong up trends making new 52w highs. No sell. Signal for me yet.

2155 2018-11-26 01:23:05 “They go to the local office”, what office do you mean?

Bump stocks didn’t really make the shooting worse. The large crowds, the overhead angle, the confusion, the element of surprise, all those things mattered far more. But sure, banning bump stocks makes guns not dangerous.
2156 2018-11-26 01:21:25 Difficult to make projections when commodity is crashing. Guess the crash is almost as is oversold. However, during crashes, often doesn't matter. Not interested in playing oil or oil stocks until volatility subsides. Correction in '17 was to $42. Should not  see a lower low.
2157 2018-11-26 01:20:31 Whats the turn around time to get ur funds after selling stocks?... We wait 3 days till the bank finishes playing with our money
2158 2018-11-26 01:19:46 Therefore rise in CO2 is nearly all due to human CO2 emissions. Your analysis, a la Salby, confuses stocks with flows, like confusing a balance sheet with a cash flow statement in financial reports. This should be understood easily but there is resistance.
2159 2018-11-26 01:17:37 *stocks up on Vitamin D gummies*
2160 2018-11-26 01:16:52 Yes, but story line was that P/Es were higher because Trump had unleashed animal spirits and unshackled the economy from regulations. It was not that investors had bid stocks up because of a one time boost to earnings. And that after investors would be willing to pay less.
2161 2018-11-26 01:16:11 Let's face it small resource stocks have been pummelled as if it's all over for quite a while . Made doubly difficult because rubbish stocks got pumped in the lithium etc. 'boom'

But good ones are progressing projects and are cheap. Seen it turn around quickly many before

2173 2018-11-26 01:05:24 Took alot of strength to hold on. Happened with the lithium stocks each declining by 50% several times over the last 3 years. Bit of share price pressure also makes the bod work a bit faster imo
2174 2018-11-26 01:04:09 Oil price gains for paint stocks is still some time away
2175 2018-11-26 00:59:21 Since you seem to know a thing or two about the subject, if Harper had held onto the GM stocks owned by the Canadian government instead of selling them to create a fake surplus, would GM still be closing their Oshawa plant right now?

2177 2018-11-26 00:54:13 As Black Friday came and went, team STORC saw good contributions from retail related stocks like Walmart and Amazon. However, stocks like Apple did not perform as well as we would have liked. STORC looks to at least break 30 in the ranks as the game comes to its finals week.
2178 2018-11-26 00:52:06 @realDonaldTrump How do you think the market will react when Fannie and Freddie collapse because the gov is stealing all their capital?  No 30 yr mortgage, no middle class, no housing / Construction market!  US stocks fall....economy tanks.  ALL Americans will blame you!!! $fnma
2179 2018-11-26 00:48:13 Sound about right. It used to be if oil prices got below $50, alternative energy stocks would fall flat. Is that still the number?
2180 2018-11-26 00:48:10 Buy low sell high was tongue in cheek. You seem to make sensible comments about stocks. Why futz with currencies? I am guessing that if you could do it over you would.
2181 2018-11-26 00:46:11 Buy buy buy  @DeadDrawGaming stocks. 
2182 2018-11-26 00:45:46 Hi preet, what are the weak stocks as per ur studay?
2183 2018-11-26 00:45:34 They use me to pick stocks so I follow trends! That is it I research. And the government, this administration has been stealing information and intellectual property and selling it to the media and other companies.
2184 2018-11-26 00:42:25 Awesome! Yeah if you have any questions let me know.

Have a look at Apple (AAPL) stocks on the 4hr chart. We just hit the #mavsretracement target. ~$175
2185 2018-11-26 00:41:15 Watch the stocks that shows strong resistance to pressure when the market is weak, and buy those stocks for all you are worth. - James R. Keene
2186 2018-11-26 00:41:10 No. It's because the fish aren't caught in our waters. And bigger fleets mean unsustainable fishing- affects stocks- benefits no-one.

Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall tried the herring/mackerel thing...how did that work out? 
2187 2018-11-26 00:34:53 The CFP has come a long way.  Fishers wanted to believe that the fish stocks were limitless and any restrictions were something unfairly imposed on them. It has been very difficult to create meaningful regulations that could work.  But many stock are now recovering
2188 2018-11-26 00:31:20 I should buy stocks in San Pellegrino sparking water.
2189 2018-11-26 00:31:07 The UK fishing sector has not in any way been 'screwed' by the CFP or indeed the EU.
  
The total catch is governed by an UN agreement on sustainable catch.

UK has itself introduces tradable  quotas, UK fishers have overfished many stocks. Large vessels have replaced small boats
2190 2018-11-26 00:27:34 You obviously know nothing about what you're yapping about. But just in case I misunderstood...you're saying stocks leveled so money wasn't made?
2191 2018-11-26 00:26:18 Who stocks up on the liberal propagandist newspapers?  Transients who need toilet paper.

2198 2018-11-26 00:20:34 Ese 30% sale de algun lado, y prefieren presionar sobre las personas y sus stocks de bienes que sobre las ganancias y la inversion productiva.
2199 2018-11-26 00:20:32 I'm notoriously bad at closing out last stocks.
2200 2018-11-26 00:19:50 Stocks or crypto?
2201 2018-11-26 00:18:53 Absolutely think so, although doesn't solve the bigger problem of guys with giant rooms basically getting into impossible to lose situations by buying thin stocks and their subs all piling in and pushing it. Industry badly needs some solution for that nonsense as well
2202 2018-11-26 00:18:30 I would’ve maybe given mine some hot stock tips. And also told her to learn how stocks work.

2204 2018-11-26 00:17:02 Je me rappelle par exemple que le 1er pressage CD de "Sad hill" avait un souci, ils ont rappelé les stocks (y'a eu quelques fuites, normal lol), fait represser et remis en vente la semaine suivante. Ces copies "défectueuses" se trouvent en occase parfois.
