8 2018-10-16 23:59:00 The part about Beto voting for $10 tax in oil is a bold faced lie.  That issue hasn’t even come up for a vote since he took office.

38 2018-10-16 23:57:45 Actually, I would side with @boo on this. WWII was the last time we had a real threat to The United States of America. Korea, Vietnam we're both political fights Iraq oil Bosnia & Afghanistan humanitarian missions.

43 2018-10-16 23:57:26 Due to cutbacks that occurred when oil prices plummeted. There was no tax base. It used to be open at 7am til 8pm. No Sat.

46 2018-10-16 23:57:08 Ok, I'll stick my neck out on this one. In July '18, total hydrocarbon exports were 7.8 mbpd. Imports: 10.2 mbpd. The deficit: ~2.4mbpd. Last February it was 3mbpd. In 2017 it was 3.76 mbpd. It's not about oil this time.  This should worry you even more tho.
47 2018-10-16 23:57:03 lol some oil and youll be like the newest  engine in a new ferrari
48 2018-10-16 23:56:54 Love olive oil. Hate olives and tapenade. 

Love peanuts. Hate peanut butter.
49 2018-10-16 23:56:50 Three— cannabis has actually been proven to be an incredibly useful medicine for many patients and in many ways— CBD oil to me has shown incredible promise for so many diseases, cancer patients, people suffering from seizures, etc. We tend to class drugs that are illegal as “bad”
50 2018-10-16 23:56:45 What are you ACTUALLY supposed to use baby oil for? I mean do people really have oily babies around the house?
51 2018-10-16 23:56:45 しおっ…
52 2018-10-16 23:56:44 At Starbucks asked for a triple espresso with heavy whipping cream and asked if they had real  butter. They said it was grass fed and asked if I wanted mct oil. They even referred to it as bulletproof. @bulletproofexec you've even invaded Starbucks.
53 2018-10-16 23:56:40 Wow Annabel, 
@BehrouzBoochani is the modern day snake oil salesman.
Let's start by finding his papers and passport that he threw away to at least give him some sort of credibility to who he is.
54 2018-10-16 23:56:35 It's oil you mix into the cream. Oil comes in a bottle with a measured dropper. The cream works well on sore muscles etc.
55 2018-10-16 23:56:23 i don't understand how i can season my fried rice so much and have it still literally taste like nothing, like when i eat depression rice with just salt and butter it has more flavor that this and i put like 7 seasonings in this not including the sesame oil it was fried in
56 2018-10-16 23:56:23 I'm at least 7,000 miles over my due date for an oil change........
57 2018-10-16 23:56:09 I got a “microwave air popper” a few years back - now if that doesn’t confuses things I don’t know what can.

But my favorite is still pot, glass lid, oil, salt and over a burner- with melted butter -
58 2018-10-16 23:56:00 It’s time time abolish the military industrial complex and break up Saudi Arabia alliance no oil no weapons no money
59 2018-10-16 23:55:55 In order to stop doing business with Saudi the US needs to get back to sound money. As long as oil transactions are done in USD(petro dollar)we will be in bed with the Saudis. Oil transactions is the only thing keeping the dollar in demand. #gold #silver #bitcoin
60 2018-10-16 23:55:54 Far less than the cost of coal or fracking or oil sands to the environment.
61 2018-10-16 23:55:42 What difference does it make if he said yes we did it or they find out later he did they are vastly wealthy have all the oil. 
What u actually going to do without there oil ur finished has a country ur not going to start a war 1000s of Americans to die.
U canonly freeze assets
62 2018-10-16 23:55:40 Oil control powder at wet and wild blush ang labanan for today! hahahaha

64 2018-10-16 23:55:33 Socialist dont share especially with us little people. Beto is a socialist, ask him. When his preacher kumbayah TV adds started he shut up abt his socialist beliefs & love for parts of communism. Seriously, just ask him & he will tell you. And he hates oil cos, so y live in TX?
65 2018-10-16 23:55:28 ヨーグルトも食べないなぁ
66 2018-10-16 23:55:16 Tom Kha... char onion,  ginger...add lemongrass. oil it up. 2 minutes. add chicken stock, liter. cut up 2 chicken breasts. Cut up  mushrooms. add to stock. Add cocunut milk at end.  Easy and fun. Season with salt and pepper.
67 2018-10-16 23:55:11 I smell a connection between the renewed commitment between Russia and Saudi Arabia re: oil production/costs and this Khasshogi death.  I think it's a chess move.  Putin knows Trump enough (and owns him) to determine how he would play his hand after report of the mysterious death
68 2018-10-16 23:55:11 We just checked my car for oil ... there’s none ! Let’s hope I didn’t ruin my engine
69 2018-10-16 23:55:04 Official @SeloOils appreciation thread. 

Just got my bottle today. 

Throughly impressed with the design. 

More importantly, throughly impressed with the quality. 

Hands down the best olive oil I’ve tasted. 

Superb job @KyleTrouble @SeloSlav

70 2018-10-16 23:54:58 Why tf do they need to check your trunk for an oil change..?
71 2018-10-16 23:54:55 Oil change just costed me $85
 Now I remember why I never came back to this place
72 2018-10-16 23:54:42 My bicycle...rode it all over the neighborhood and on the oil field roads behind our house.
73 2018-10-16 23:54:28 Not Rogue Killers after all per Turkey!

BUT:

House of Orange & House of Oil sitting' in Khashoggi's story

First comes denials, then comes excuses  

Then comes Alternative Truth in Sham Investigation!
74 2018-10-16 23:54:28 But..you dont know ANYTHING about running ANY LEGIT BUSINESS! Are you gonna give tax cheat tips? Brag how Saudi oil $ is buying weapons to kill innocents? Constitution guarantees free press. GREEN CARD = PERMANENT RESIDENT You are derelict in your constitutional duty.
75 2018-10-16 23:54:17 Everyone should really start taking oregano oil and neem capsules daily.  Oregano oil kills lyme disease, and neem absolutely kills fungus, is highly antibacterial and antiparasitic.  High in vitamin c, too.
76 2018-10-16 23:54:08 Oil field money ? It sound good...
77 2018-10-16 23:54:05 True. But oil prices are MORE important for the time being. Big Picture.
78 2018-10-16 23:54:02 Busy Week: Oct. 17, 1973: Think gas prices are crazy now? Back in the day OPEC raised the price of oil by 70%!!
79 2018-10-16 23:53:59 Mike your snake oil is showing
80 2018-10-16 23:53:54 It's said that 819,000 Americans claim to have a Cherokee ancestor. Just a hunch, but most of them either live in Oklahoma or in close proximity. Why? Oil royalties.
81 2018-10-16 23:53:51 @JohnStossel The reason why Libertarianism never made any impact on society is because it is based on a big, ugly compromise. You are trying to combine social liberalism with fiscal responsibility (oil & water). Hilariously stupid.
82 2018-10-16 23:53:48 Also the country whose oil industry props up the US Dollar
83 2018-10-16 23:53:44 .@JoeCunninghamSC will stand up to Big Oil and Big Phama so he can stand up for us. He's the honest, accountable leadership South Carolina needs.
84 2018-10-16 23:53:41 Money. There's money in gas and oil and people are stupid.

86 2018-10-16 23:53:23 £60bn is our total revenue raised. thats the big total. thats all the income tax, vat, CT, oil revenue, NI 

everthing. the total. all income tax.
87 2018-10-16 23:53:20 Oil $$ is pretty slick
88 2018-10-16 23:53:14 It’s ridiculous we buy oil, regardless of who we buy it from. We have more than enough for our national security and domestic needs!
89 2018-10-16 23:52:57 Firstly there are more than one version of history, no definitive version, secondly, many so called historians have been called out for selling snake oil, Aryan invasion theory is a good example.
90 2018-10-16 23:52:54 I use healthy oils. I’ve heard that Argan oil is better for your skin than coconut oil but I’ve used of those and paired with regular exfoliation, they have completely reinvented my skin.
91 2018-10-16 23:52:51 The 5gal oil bucket really brings the whole picture together.
92 2018-10-16 23:52:37 I agree regarding #cdnpoli oil imports from Saudis but do you not realize the economics of sending large volumes of Alberta oil all the way to the Maritimes are more or less prohibitive by rail and there is no pipeline? Would you prefer Canada buys oil from Iranians instead??
93 2018-10-16 23:52:35 any1 got any lush skincare product suggestions Dont say tea tree oil it makes me breakout

95 2018-10-16 23:52:27 They don’t want the soil, just the oil that’s beneath that
96 2018-10-16 23:52:18 I’m not an anarchist on any level, and I believe that hegemony (though ideally with multi-lateral Democratic participation not oil hungry Americans) is necessary to build a better world in our globalized condition. I also support the continued existence of Israel. Though, I’m not
97 2018-10-16 23:52:13 No, we’re ready to ramp up US oil production to stick it to the 9/11 conspirators...
98 2018-10-16 23:52:09 I’ll take the word of a dr over a homeopath and I’ll take the word of a scientist publishing in a peer reviewed journal over oil industry spokesperson.

101 2018-10-16 23:51:45 What happened in Saudi Arabia is horrific. Why are governments (esp @WhiteHouse ) putting up with this?
Oh right. Oil. Business deals.

Fold over top. 

Shake

I staple in top of you have one handy

Cook until done.
108 2018-10-16 23:51:17 Do it from scratch. The old way with some oil and real butter! I use organic popcorn cuz it’s better. I won’t go back to air or the other one

114 2018-10-16 23:50:04 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.

116 2018-10-16 23:49:49 No not starting with Jackson, but he was one of the worst.

The oil pipelines that 45 has taken off restriction and now allowed to go through.

117 2018-10-16 23:49:47 **useful tip: wipe your yoga/workout mat with warm water and eucalyptus oil

118 2018-10-16 23:49:40 The saemmul oil control.
119 2018-10-16 23:49:35 Especially since we don’t need this oil anymore.
120 2018-10-16 23:49:32 Anyone who isn’t using rosehip oil in their face routine needs to start ASAP
121 2018-10-16 23:49:26 I believe the Saudi crown prince, I like oil at 50$ a barrel, I don’t want to pay 5$ a gallon for gas.
122 2018-10-16 23:49:23 Why do we treat Saudi Arabia any differently than we treat Iran? Just the oil?

126 2018-10-16 23:49:01 Oil popped.
127 2018-10-16 23:48:50 The United States gets literally zero oil from Saudi Arabia, most of it goes to China. This isn't about oil, this is about Iran and the neocon/Israeli wet dream of the US invading Iran, which would need Saudi support for legitimacy.
128 2018-10-16 23:48:41 why tea tree oil smells so storng
129 2018-10-16 23:48:37 Screw all of them including the oil rich Saudis. America is oil self sufficient. If America cuts them what do they do. Sell it to N Korea or maybe Venezuela.
130 2018-10-16 23:48:33 Peppermint oil on your stomach will help!
131 2018-10-16 23:48:07 Anyone in atl got oil cartridges?
132 2018-10-16 23:48:01 Nigeria, Venezuela, Iran ? Oil isn’t everything and Scotland doesn’t have much, plus climate change and stuff. I hope the UK stays together but it’s clearly up to the Scots. 
133 2018-10-16 23:47:51 Driving is driving the cost of oil.
134 2018-10-16 23:47:41 Also, to switch gears entirely: Canada also has a self-interested reason to use carbon pricing to bring down our emissions. If we don't, the Alberta oil sands will continue to be blamed for climate change. Canada's argument is that we need to cut *demand*, not withhold supply.
135 2018-10-16 23:47:30 From start to finish....sounds like mechanical talk..so if my oil light is on but there’s plenty in there, I should call my mechanic yeh??
136 2018-10-16 23:47:21 We bought a twirlygig stovetop popper. Sometimes I use lard, sometimes veg. oil.
137 2018-10-16 23:47:15 I just wasn’t thinking ahead. Midnight oil is burning in the Scheming Room.
138 2018-10-16 23:47:01 I get my oil changed there. Its a great deal.
139 2018-10-16 23:46:47 Atta girl! Im going to wait til the crowds die down a bit . I hate the smell of the smoke, so I'm going to wait til I can get some oil to cook with
140 2018-10-16 23:46:37 Now that most of the world is giving #SaudiArabia a Get-out-of-Jail card on this one, I wonder how many more times this will happen before the world speaks up? #Oil
141 2018-10-16 23:46:32 3 main types of Oil: Vegetable (Castor Oil), Synthetic Oil and Mineral Oil. Mineral oil is by far most adopted for piston engines.
142 2018-10-16 23:46:29 Haha don't get me started on that Facebook one' yesterday was asking what's best to clean a chrom towel rail rad with. Many people replied with baby oil?  
My reply ... " don't slip will you for god sake be like a slip and slide"# TradesTalk
143 2018-10-16 23:46:17 yeah im not buying anything the saudi’s try to come up with to excuse this. already know this will probably just blow over since im sure trump doesn’t want to lose our arms deal with them. not to mention our stake in their oil.
144 2018-10-16 23:46:16 Cant we just try and find a better source of fuel? If we fix prices for US oil companies? International companies will undercharge our oil companies, force them to go bankrupt and sell, then we would no longer own our own resources. Like how Russia has Germany.
145 2018-10-16 23:46:03 Check your Engine oil this morning.
146 2018-10-16 23:45:52 Poor soul...pan popped in oil.
147 2018-10-16 23:45:47 Beard oil is crucial from the first stages outwards. It primes the skin, and it keeps hair soft. I like beard balm, too, to keep the hair conditioned and soft. Different skin and hair likes different base oils, so you might have to experiment.
148 2018-10-16 23:45:45 please don't raise the price of oil till November 7th please pretty please
149 2018-10-16 23:45:44 Threats from Saudi Arabia should have no effect on how the USA conducts business. They can stick their oil up their Ass! We cannot let Saudi run wild killing people in the World. Buy the Russian Jets. We’ll shoot them out of the Air!
150 2018-10-16 23:45:43 Easy. Silence critics. Know that fake-president and pretty-boy son-in-law are so easily corruptible by that rich Saudi oil money flowing straight to their pockets and not sweat it. Bring in cleaning crew, paint the walls, claim ignorance or rogue killers. Done. #notnormal
151 2018-10-16 23:45:38 Reminder: Go and get ya whip an oil change.
152 2018-10-16 23:45:37 If only they had huge reserves of oil, and bought vast amounts of weapons, then they could do what f**k they wanted, and trump would bend over and let them
153 2018-10-16 23:45:20 @maddow I'm wondering if you believe there is a connection between the renewed oil production agreements made between Saudi Arabia and Russia and the recent murder of Khasshogi?  re: possible increase in oil/barrel cost?  Could that have been a calculated move?  Sound nuts?
154 2018-10-16 23:45:14 They know, get one foot on American soil and you're in. A promise to show up at court, an ankle monitor they cut off, and they are in the wind never to be seen again.
155 2018-10-16 23:45:03 The girl giving me a pedi said my feet were perfect. No calluses & they were smooth. Hells yas, girl! I give myself a pedi twice a week & rub olive oil on them ever night. I’m a beautician, my feet take a beating.
156 2018-10-16 23:44:59 Thanks for the deversion!  My Mom use to put oil in skillet and pour in the cornels and cover and shake.  Best popcorn ever!!!
157 2018-10-16 23:44:55 this oil burner really did her work whew the air in my room skinny
158 2018-10-16 23:44:33 For tonight's lazy toddler dinner: hummus sandwich, leftover chickpea pancakes, Trader Joe's frozen broccoli cooked in the toaster oven with olive oil and onion powder, and banana for dessert. #momlife #mamalife #imtired #ijustcant #twinmom #toddlerlife #toddlermeals
159 2018-10-16 23:44:24 saudis oil money is welcome
rather pay with that for the
shit that needs to be paid than
spending your own black gold money and on top of that youre
not even exploiting the saudis
in any sense as you got fair contracts that are honoured
why spoil that why do you want
him involved
160 2018-10-16 23:44:21 Dear beard-havers, and also knowledgeable kissers of beard-havers, please to discuss with me beard oil and other anti-prickle-and-itch techniques or fave products  gonna do some exploration of facial hair ownership this winter methinks

163 2018-10-16 23:44:02 As of right now,  the US is not only the world's largest producer of oil, it is the largest exporter of oil.
164 2018-10-16 23:43:51 It's too much olive oil involved for it to not be 
165 2018-10-16 23:43:27 The largest sources of U.S. imported oil were: Canada (40%), Saudi Arabia (11%), Venezuela (9%), Mexico (8%), and Colombia (4%).  Get your toques and Molsons boys and girls.  Our time has come, eh?
166 2018-10-16 23:43:26 All travelers must comply w/ federal law on transporting cannabis infused products, such as CBD oil, on board a flight. Our officers are required to notify law enforcement officers if they discover these products while screening property.
167 2018-10-16 23:43:20 @Walmart can y’all tell me why I waited in line for 30 mins to get an oil change and when it came to my turn they told me they couldn’t do it? Like tell me when I get there not 30 minutes after. I got shit to do.
168 2018-10-16 23:43:12 I just wanna give him a deep conditioning/ hot oil treatment I’m saying this BECAUSe I love him so much I wouldn’t say it if I didn’t care
169 2018-10-16 23:43:10 So we are back to the ol' snake oil about climate change? Why doesnit seem everyday the left loses more footing the resurrect old talking points? It's as if they are quickly sliding down a cliff & desperately grabbing for anything that once worked 4 them before. They are dieing!!
170 2018-10-16 23:43:09 $260 is a little over $20 / month. I feel the scrapped green initiative and rebate would’ve saved a lot more in the long run. Cheaper electric cars, cheaper resale, less dependency on oil and more on electric, which we have a surplus of.
171 2018-10-16 23:43:05 I think they meant their extreme travelling could be planned better. Aviation is the highest contributor to carbon next to the oil sands. Justin flys here and there just to pose for a selfie. I’m sure they could make cutbacks, instead of punishing the little guy with more tax.
172 2018-10-16 23:43:02 They are destroying Yemen to get more oil. They went into mexico to infiltrate America. Marauders
173 2018-10-16 23:43:02 Olive oil works too if you're thinking healthy
174 2018-10-16 23:42:51 Air-popped is MUCH healthier.
Screw that, go for the microwaved.

(I'm still looking for an old-fashioned hot oil popper - anyone out there have a tip? lol)
175 2018-10-16 23:42:48 like you have never used Saudi oil in your car or motorcycle.  we are just as guilty as they are. probably more. maybe less. who knows.
176 2018-10-16 23:42:44 Yet, millions have lived for generations in Italy, Greece, Spain, and other olive oil consuming countries... Without exactly knowing the grade of their oil. And in most cases, they used simple blended oil.
177 2018-10-16 23:42:40 At the site of the Atchafalaya Basin, Texas-based oil company Energy Transfer Partners is building the Bayou Bridge Pipeline, a 167-mile controversial pipeline of Louisiana that has faced fierce opposition from environmentalists and Indigenous activists.
178 2018-10-16 23:42:33 Microwave is full of weird chemicals and air popped is , well, air popped. I like to make mine is a covered saucepan with a bit of mazola oil and popcorn. Medium heat so you don't burn. Tastes fantastic
179 2018-10-16 23:42:20 Only my friends would know that a miniature paddington bear, a card with beautiful words, a designer bag and a refill oil for my weed pen would be the  perfect gift for me 
180 2018-10-16 23:42:19 Going grocery shopping and I'm going to get some facial and cleansing oil. That'll probably help me. Im probably lacking vitamins or something bce I do everything else I can to maintain good skin
181 2018-10-16 23:42:18 ぱんぱ
182 2018-10-16 23:42:02 We can always trust the Saudis!  They don't fund any extremists who want to see all of us dead!  Go ahead and sell them billions in arms so they can keep on supporting us westerners with their kindness and good will!  And oil!
183 2018-10-16 23:41:58 To be fair, I understand the saw had to be carried in, not standard equipment. We get more oil from Canada. It's geography. It's why we were attacked on 9/11. Bases in KSA.
184 2018-10-16 23:41:43 it’s officially happening. i’m getting my oil changed this week. wish me luck everybody. i’m truly out here tryna be an adult for once.

198 2018-10-16 23:40:16 #Commodity markets were mixed overnight. #Gold slid but #oil edged higher. The relatively weaker support in commodity prices suggest investor buying might be increasing but is still some distance away from “full-on”

203 2018-10-16 23:39:44 Ok mary satgi I try. I am using coconut oil for moisturiser
204 2018-10-16 23:39:44 Now that is an idea! They do have therapeutic massage for ill pups! They use CBD oil to soothe them! 
205 2018-10-16 23:39:30 One time I got a little happy with the baby oil and stained my sheets.
206 2018-10-16 23:39:30 We would like to take this opportunity to welcome back Chevron/Shay Oil as a sponsor of the 2019 Yuma Silver Spur Rodeo. Thank you for your continued support!
207 2018-10-16 23:39:27 The US imports oil. And it exports oil.

I know a small mind has trouble holding both ideas at once, but totes true.
208 2018-10-16 23:39:23 @DavidBCollum Perhaps it is to deliberately make oil go very high and cause a crash? The crash must have a scapegoat that is not central bankers i.e. trade or oil. It also serves to increase demand for USD just as people are dumping treasuries and dollar payments.
209 2018-10-16 23:39:22 Omg poor guy..breaks my heart..I really don't understand what palm oil is?are they eating it or is man putting it in their environment?
210 2018-10-16 23:39:18 “Add oil!”
211 2018-10-16 23:39:11 Dude! Pop it in a pan over a fire in oil. I mean, come on!
212 2018-10-16 23:39:05 I just used a good amount of sesame oil on my board so it didn't stick. But I didn't have a big pestle like hers so I used the bottom of a clean/lightly oiled wine bottle

218 2018-10-16 23:38:20 Given the objects in the image, it is fair to assume that the amphora would contan wine, not oil. Again, only a guess. As far as raisins — no idea.
219 2018-10-16 23:38:05 Anything to say about the murder of a journalist who writes for the post in a different state? This would be an act of war if it was anyone else but Saudi sells oil and buys weapons by the billions
220 2018-10-16 23:37:55 @MazdaUSA is denying my warranty after my car’s engine broke down. They drained my car of oil and took apart my engine without authorization. We checked the oil when it broke and it was full. I’ve been screamed at and hung up on by their service manager. Please retweet.
221 2018-10-16 23:37:53 The problem is that this is a MSM obsession. In reality it is an internal Saudi problem. Kashoggi has a long history w/ Saudi Royal family and he betrayed them. SA may be oil rich, but its politics are Medieval. His crime was attempted regicide, and he was dealt with summarily.
222 2018-10-16 23:37:36 it's not oil it's weapon sales....
223 2018-10-16 23:37:36 No sir .. I do not know anything about getting an oil change
224 2018-10-16 23:37:30 Does Kasich want the U.S. to implement sanctions on Saudi oil?
225 2018-10-16 23:37:23 Big Oil is putting out false info saying Measure G (SLO County) will shut down existing oil production and force us to buy more from Russia and Saudi Arabia. It's patently false. And do you suppose it's coincidental that they chose two "buzzword countries"? I am so Yes on G.

232 2018-10-16 23:36:34 I don’t think either party has a monopoly on Saudi money and oil.
233 2018-10-16 23:36:28 "And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him." ~Luke 10:34 #Jesus #God #Bible

236 2018-10-16 23:36:20 Unfortunately we on the east coast are hostages to Saudi oil until we get our pipeline east.
237 2018-10-16 23:36:13 Maybe Honduras needs to discover some oil or something...
238 2018-10-16 23:36:11 Use revenue from oil and gas to transition to other forms of energy as we can afford to. The province has spent millions advertising it?
239 2018-10-16 23:36:05 Not following all tweets but it looked like the 35 Wacker address you mentioned the other day had a lot of connections to Saudi-related business... There are literally billions of dollars in play with oil rich countries. Curious if you use a database to track all the connections.
240 2018-10-16 23:35:56 Really enjoying #SaltFatAcidHeat ...learned so much in the episode on pesto, Parmesan and olive oil #Foodies #neverstoplearning
241 2018-10-16 23:35:55 Elio smirks to himself at the strained noise that leaves the other, clearly satisfied at the knowledge of not being the only one affected by this, and he playfully smacks the other's ass to project the satisfaction before he glides down to take care of the legs. More of the oil—
242 2018-10-16 23:35:55 Glad i got family in the dispensary. This new RSO oil tho...... sheesh
243 2018-10-16 23:35:50 .@karringtonsc has gotten hundreds of thousands of dollars from big money PACs - including Big Oil. Her treasurer was a lobbyist for BP for FIFTEEN years. 

@JoeCunninghamSC will put people over PACs.
244 2018-10-16 23:35:47 I needed to take my car in for an oil change and put it off for 2 weeks because I was just too nervous and couldn’t go in so I FEEL U
245 2018-10-16 23:35:45 I don't believe this is our fight! The middle East as we all know are a different breed!
The United States is a machine that runs on oil!
Sad but true!
246 2018-10-16 23:35:45 i was pleasantly surprised when i heard that in the eighties there were more oil wells operating in texas than at any other place in the world
247 2018-10-16 23:35:39 Stove top using a Whirley Pop and a little bit of oil - best flavor, lowest cost, no added chemicals and you don't have to put up with that icky smell of microwave popcorn - and btw, this is just about as fast as microwave.  Enjoy.

249 2018-10-16 23:35:34 BREAKING OIL CHANGE SCAM:
Went to get my oil changed. They didn't change my oil, they switched my oil with new oil! I wanted my same oil, but changed. Instead, I got new, different oil. Not sure where my oil is now, but it's unchanged and gone. Beware of this scam.
250 2018-10-16 23:35:33 Been saying this for years. People tell me I’m nuts. Oil has been a national security weakness for decades.
251 2018-10-16 23:35:19 Trump try cover his ass Last king suadi Evil crime he send 15 the private guard to Jamal journalist to killed him and cut off the body  pieces why NO one stop the kings from ,USA ,Europe ,security council  UN , because his power full , oil , the dirty money

276 2018-10-16 23:32:52 this isn't really accurate, Trump is trying to sanction Iran to zero, saudi's turn off the taps and oil goes to at least $150 overnite and crashes the global economy.  good luck sanctioning saudi arabia over this.  why i say, the world has zero recourse to do anything about this
277 2018-10-16 23:32:43 @JoeCunninghamSC tells audience that Katie Arrington’s  campaign treasurer lobbied for BP oil for years.

288 2018-10-16 23:30:51 She has no credibility in Alberta or on climate.  At least not here.  Have you ever looked at where Eastern Canada gets their oil?  Do you believe those regions are rejecting all projects?  You understand that energy is about 10% of our GDP thag would be lost. Reality matters.

290 2018-10-16 23:30:41 I’ve always been pretty proud of myself because I ALWAYS get my oil changed as soon as my light comes on but this time i have to get an alignment and 2 new tires and my bank account isn’t mentally ready for that. I now see why girls usually wait till their dads remind them.
291 2018-10-16 23:30:35 I’m using sweet almond oil, but too soon to tell if it works yet!

295 2018-10-16 23:30:12 Scott on @HellsKitchenFOX cooking table side food in the kitchen  Bae: maybe he's nvr worked at a restaurant that serves table side, Hell, when's the last time u eaten at a place that does table side?? Me: Hell, I get excited when they bring bread and oil we weren't expecting
296 2018-10-16 23:30:11 I’m come to the conclusion that I don’t need to check my weather app anymore. Just need to look at my coconut oil 
297 2018-10-16 23:30:07 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed #TexasDebate

300 2018-10-16 23:29:58 Spain is a constitutional monarchy. Saudi Arabia is an oil station with a flag that performs public executions in the street.
301 2018-10-16 23:29:42 Why am I seeing people doing all these 6 months long expensive hair treatments to make hair healthier. Just use some coconut oil on a consistent basis, it’s not that hard.
302 2018-10-16 23:29:41 you literally just out the oil in whatchu mean

304 2018-10-16 23:29:28 There's a massive difference between no military and not spending trillions of dollars to perpetuate unjust wars & sacrifice our troops on the altar of oil money.
305 2018-10-16 23:29:27 Brilliant read. Saudi Arabia is a repulsive regime. As oil consumers we need to question when we could walk or cycle rather than drive, conseve energy and use renewables for heat and power. We need to move our societies away from dependence on this regime and those like it.
306 2018-10-16 23:29:25 #COMM3460 @avaliavska  An example of risk rhetoric is the rhetoric from an oil organization to the affected people of the drill. For example the oil companys rhetoric that drills outside of my neighborhood that tried to convince the neighbors this was beneficial to us.
307 2018-10-16 23:29:14 is it just Oil Lobby eager to destroy Arabs?

309 2018-10-16 23:28:54 I really don't think that is best option. However .10/1$ sent or sanction on every barrel of oil sent from Mexico by pipeline are real options to pay for wall and ongoing border security. Once secure focus on visa overstays.
310 2018-10-16 23:28:51 Hey @realDonaldTrump , carbon free fuel reduces the need for Saudi oil. Get your weapons industries designing and manufacturing clean energy. Export to Europe. You know it’s a win win win   
Down with global warming means down with jihad.
311 2018-10-16 23:28:48 I still like the UFO oil, but that's about all.
312 2018-10-16 23:28:43 gas oil dominated, much like politics mo money in pocket for their investments.... now we only have 6yrs to fix the global warming problem, their end to mo money & humanity in 12 yrs.
313 2018-10-16 23:28:36 Trump & US Republicans are (supposedly) facing a tough midterm fight next month, 1 day after oil sanctions,. In  order to avoid an oil crisis & massive jump in oil prices, Trump needs the Saudis to increase their oil output and keep gasoline prices reasonable

315 2018-10-16 23:27:52 I asked him his thoughts on the film. He said, “What happens to Indigenous ppl is wrong and it’s wrong to hurt the planet.” Asked him what happens if a pipeline full of oil breaks or bursts? “It’s gonna hurt the earth. And water, too. The fish can’t breathe. Ppl can’t drink it.”
316 2018-10-16 23:27:48 I asked lisa and she vehemently said no and that you're only supposed to add salt during that period and oil comes after you drain it ??

320 2018-10-16 23:26:43 The investment needed to capture this energy far better spent on building transmission lines and connecting to solar energy from southern latitudes. Why? because its a better long term ROI. If you dump billions into extracting oil and gas what do you have in the end? nothing.
321 2018-10-16 23:26:35 the snake oil salesman SAID all poor people should be deported but actually meant all people I don't like should be deported!
322 2018-10-16 23:26:28 Trudeau recently pledged $1.5 Billion for an ocean protection plan for oil spill cleanups. That is my tax money going to pay for their mess. If they are so damn rich they should pay it. How is that not considered welfare. Thought they right hated welfare?
323 2018-10-16 23:26:27 Michael Cohen is a snake oil salesmen and a conman. All the great things Donald Trump has done for him. He should be grateful!

325 2018-10-16 23:26:20 Right? He's an amazing person. He's a holocaust survivor and an architect, and he does beautiful oil paintings. He walks around the lake every day and then comes in for a cup of tea.
326 2018-10-16 23:26:12 Does anybody actually want to drill off of the SC Coast? The oil companies aren't lining up. Pick a real issue.
327 2018-10-16 23:26:05 There are so many foods I love that use Palm Oil Pam if I stopped eating them I might become an endangered species too 

One I have recently discovered is olive oil spread which doesn't contain it (whereas Flora does)

One down I suppose.

331 2018-10-16 23:25:38 Margarine made with canola oil isnt usually vegan. It still has maltodextrin in it most of the time, which is a milk ingredient.
332 2018-10-16 23:25:29 I obsessively use oils & lotion on my hands to try to avoid it. It especially helps bc i don’t want lotion or oil in my mouth  I can’t break biting the skin off my lips or cheek chewing to save my life.
333 2018-10-16 23:25:18 Solar power will replace that cursed Saudi oil.
334 2018-10-16 23:25:17 “dad how do i check my oil” “just have will do it” “yeah but what does it look like” “have will do it” “okay yeah but what do i have to to do” “seriously have will do it for you” lol apparently my dad doesn’t think i’m capable of checking my car’s oil and he is 100% right
335 2018-10-16 23:25:13 Exhausted after staying up all night making copies of Peter Garrett songs. I'm really burning the Midnight Oil here guys.
336 2018-10-16 23:25:04 I personally think we should have already bowed them  Off the face of the Earth. I would take there oil that can suck my ass.

342 2018-10-16 23:24:33 "stop oil companies from polluting the earth"

What do you mean by pollution? What practical solutions do you have in mind? 

New nuclear could be built now.
343 2018-10-16 23:24:12 That's my prayer too
Let oil just hold till i get out of this sinking ship
344 2018-10-16 23:24:07 The fact the Media blew this story up without any evidence got me suspicious from day 1. Also, if SA retaliates from any US action, MBS will knock crude oil up to $200/barrel. That would equal $9.00 a gallon gasoline. Ummm no thanks.
345 2018-10-16 23:23:53 Well, it worked for selling a war. Remember that? The Iraq War would pay for itself with oil revenue. 
346 2018-10-16 23:23:50 Who care anymore?  Dirty oil will still finance this propaganda but cars ON THE ROAD & US TALKING REALITY is what's important... this is a snowball...and FFV's/ ICE are toast as battery mfg capacity is ramping fast
347 2018-10-16 23:23:18 I often see that argument that the rest of the UK exported more to the EU than Scotland does, & this invented "internal market" is more important.

What is never included is north sea fucking oil, you know attributed to Scotland, or that every fucking car maker is in England.
348 2018-10-16 23:23:12 The reviews for palmers skin therapy oil complained about it smelling like chocolate & I don’t see how it’s an issue, this shit smells delicious

351 2018-10-16 23:22:55 I use Saudi oil in my van.  I have ties to the Crown Prince.  I'm going to turn myself in.  I killed the poor guy.  And carved him up like a big fat Thanksgiving Turkey.  The blood spewed like a fountain.  It was epic.
352 2018-10-16 23:22:52 home alone, watching Salt Fat Acid Heat, screaming OH MY GOD every five minutes, and unsuccessfully trying to talk myself out of dedicating my entire life to olive oil.
353 2018-10-16 23:22:51 Looks yummy Gaby. My go to kale salad is kale, toasted almonds, green onions and thinly shaved parmesan. Dressing is also simple. 1/2 cup olive oil, 1/4 cup lemon juice, TSP Dijon and kosher salt!!!  I can eat this every day.

355 2018-10-16 23:21:52 In general the combination of rising oil & energy prices plus a major trade war between the 2 leading national economies with high tariffs is toxic for global economy
356 2018-10-16 23:21:45 I am just LMAO at you dummies letting some Caucasian hoe named fucking Sunday scam y’all out of $100 for a 1 oz bottle of some tea tree oil
357 2018-10-16 23:21:41 Cbd oil bottle: you shouldn’t take more than 8 drops a day!
Me, emptying half the bottle into my mouth: and?
358 2018-10-16 23:21:02 @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump and George Bush -  This is another example why Saudi Arabia should have been added to the Axis of Evil after 9/11, and completely cut off as an ally. And, they probably would be it wasn't for their abundance of oil.
359 2018-10-16 23:20:55 Why do we have to be allies with people that execute gays and chop women’s heads off? Let’s just take the oil. We have lots of practice
360 2018-10-16 23:20:32 I watched 1st episode today. Great show! Showing olive oil &  parmesan cheese production, cutting hog...
361 2018-10-16 23:20:19 what he meant to was we'll demands oil, lots of oil, for free... or they are guilty :)
362 2018-10-16 23:20:18 Re: gold - very possible.  What happens to the value of gold & western vault holdings (& by extension the USD) if China says “Phys gold is worth $10,000 in Chinese goods or 150 bbls of Russian/Iranian/Venezuelan oil”?  

THAT is the “nuclear option.”

365 2018-10-16 23:19:58 America NEVER does!!!! We’re getting their oil, and we’re giving them weapons.
366 2018-10-16 23:19:48 I wouldn't know. I don't acknowledge him beyond his role as a salesman of ideological snake oil. However, what he has built has quite the net value.
367 2018-10-16 23:19:43 In that photo where are the 2l cooking oil???
368 2018-10-16 23:19:37 The US imports less oil from them under Trump then any other President in my life. And it’s steadily declining. So under Trump we are moving away from them
369 2018-10-16 23:19:34 I'm happy for people who recently got jobs, but it will contribute to higher inflation. It would be okay, if you hadn't topped that with sudden tax cuts, trade tariffs and disruption of the oil market.

377 2018-10-16 23:19:06 Why is No so high oil helps it not stick together?????????
378 2018-10-16 23:18:49 I Don't agree, who knows what Saudis can do in a case of fear or emergency. Sell all 166 billion USA bonds they've got?, or maybe stop selling oil to the USA? Do you want to know what happens after those actions? Have a guess.
379 2018-10-16 23:18:48 That bobbing up and down in the back of the classroom? It should be an oil rig.

382 2018-10-16 23:18:32 No business in Saudi Arabia, lots of business WITH  them! The con man president! Shyster. Snake oil salesman. Embarrassment!
383 2018-10-16 23:18:27 Some are so gullible that they don't appreciate the end of the 'Oil Cabal' reign in Nigeria. All they see is change in price...they had forgotten how they queue for days in filling station with almost double the current  price of petrol in hand and still no fuel
384 2018-10-16 23:18:26 Great work.
385 2018-10-16 23:18:20 the current mood is me reading about the medicinal benefits of oats to my gf over the phone while she changes the oil on her mom's car

391 2018-10-16 23:18:06 Any body looking for oil?
392 2018-10-16 23:18:02 I would prefer it written to indicate the houses intruded on the oil well site. This makes it sound exactly the opposite. I know you realize it Jacob. It’s not about selling your argument at all costs, it’s about honesty. This isn’t and hurts your credibility and the stations
393 2018-10-16 23:17:26 Gives it to them out of the goodness of their hearts.  How much do these oil companies pay in taxes.  The left makes it sound like they pay no taxes and that government actually pay them to produce energy,

396 2018-10-16 23:16:45 Increased our coal exports by 60 percent; U.S. oil production recently reached all-time high.

United States is a net natural gas exporter for the first time since 1957.

Withdrew the United States from the job-killing Paris Climate Accord.

Revived Steele and coal industry
397 2018-10-16 23:16:37 Climate Change is a joke, it is the tool of Corps with unprofitable Solar & Wind Farms to use regulations to assault traditional energy products like Coal, Oil, & Natural Gas. Further it is used to enact global regs that would make their green energy products profitable.
398 2018-10-16 23:16:36 Sinus irrigation with salt water or diluted hydrogen peroxide to kill any infection. Garlic or oil of oregano for antiviral. Hot peppers or cayenne powder for circulation and antiviral. Vitamin D and blue light (sun) to mobilize killer T cells.

Alberta, Canada is RICH in OIL.  Maybe You could negotiate a deal.....I don't think the past Presidents i.e. Bush could manage The Deal.  You could.......
403 2018-10-16 23:15:41 I have this friend that already annoys the shit out of me but also pushes her essential oil pyramid scheme all the time on top of that. A while back I switched out one of the things that said “peace and calming” with some other bullshitted named one and just never told anyone.
404 2018-10-16 23:15:38 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.

406 2018-10-16 23:15:33 And when the price of oil goes to $200/barrel and gas goes to $6/gallon and the economy tanks, then what?  All Over the assignation of a Saudi journalist?
407 2018-10-16 23:15:32 Oil, Oil is what happened !
408 2018-10-16 23:15:31 @WhiteHouse Now The Worlds Oil Reserves Are Extremely Valuable. See. It's  Done. My Authorization. Of It.
409 2018-10-16 23:15:27 Maybe not re: oil , but powerful with their financial influence on the world.
410 2018-10-16 23:15:26 Every American should go out and buy an electric car. All the Saudis have is oil. American should not buy their oil and we should not sell them our weapons. DUH...Mr. Trump
411 2018-10-16 23:15:25 Well, here are my positions:

1. Cryptos are not viable payment systems for legal uses.

2. Investing in cryptocurrencies is a financial scam.

3. Cryptos inherently violate KYC/AML.

4. Blockchain technology is snake oil.

5. Smart contracts are useless.

What do you say?
412 2018-10-16 23:15:20 Hey @piersmorgan, I’ve worked on oil rigs, as a lumberjack, framed houses for years and now run huge commercial construction jobs. I would use a papoose any day of the week. Get a grip you disgusting dinosaur. We’re done with your way of outdated thinking.
413 2018-10-16 23:15:16 oh boy we all fall down the well over oil
414 2018-10-16 23:15:10 RT @LivingSafely: #Lays Smooth #Ranch Dip this October? Top four ingredients are water, oil, modified tapioca and corn starch.
415 2018-10-16 23:15:09 Tax breaks. You mean fewer taxes on the money they make.  Why should oil companies be forced to pay for clean energy.  They provide cheap energy to the world and the left wants them to pay to destroy their own business.  Thank God you don’t have a lot of power
416 2018-10-16 23:15:03 Umm, farmer welfare, oil subsidies, coal welfare, and on and on.
417 2018-10-16 23:14:41 It is still, and always been, about religion (Crusades), oil, and weapons. We pay for oil, they pay for weapons.
418 2018-10-16 23:14:34 There no problem. Poppi made of special alloy. No need for rust or oil.
419 2018-10-16 23:14:23 Right. We banked on dirty oil. Some places won’t even refine it. Best investment is moving away from oil...dirty, unethical or whatever you want to call it.
420 2018-10-16 23:14:18 @WhiteHouse I Will Establish Global Oil. Includes Alberta Oil Sands Oil. To A Price Of. $5000 Per Barrel. Global. See.
421 2018-10-16 23:14:10 Good work @darrelwebb More pointed questions need to be as to what livestock & other oil crops are doing on their parts. And businesses only buy half of certified palm oil produced, that is poor form. Not that they are paying any premium @melisa_idris
422 2018-10-16 23:13:56 Canada gives about $3.3 BILLION DOLLARS every year to oil and gas producers.
423 2018-10-16 23:13:55 Great, since oil and gas revenues are up let's rescind the medicaid cuts of 2016 that are affecting lots of New Mexicans and all medical providers in NM! @RealSTNewMexico
424 2018-10-16 23:13:53 Just the ones without oil in their lamps.

427 2018-10-16 23:13:38 Oil imports from Saudi Arabia provided 4.8 percent of total US consumption in 2017.
428 2018-10-16 23:13:25 what is the deal with tea tree oil soap
429 2018-10-16 23:13:22 Maybe the bot can't be able to avoid getting an oil change for like 3 more features than the most trash industrial society

434 2018-10-16 23:13:03 What’s every1s beef with the smell of argan oil ??? I lov it
435 2018-10-16 23:12:56 I expect there'll be a few RTS's with this tweet. 
Gaddafi's Libya had a form of UBI I believe, financed with oil revenues.
436 2018-10-16 23:12:47 นั่นสิเนอะ เดี๋ยวดิฉันจะรีบส่งคนไปดูแล
437 2018-10-16 23:12:33 Its called your gas pump....unfortunately we are depenedant upon these folks for oil...the same world balance  all scream for....instead of getting our own...Jones you are smarter than this
438 2018-10-16 23:11:50 Yes, through ISOs (I'm familiar with MISO, to a degree). It's essentially like trading oil futures without ever intending to take delivery of any physical barrels. There is also a market for congestion fee contracts (essentially bets on what the realized fees will be).

440 2018-10-16 23:11:33 The oil itself burns dirtier. Do you know anything?
441 2018-10-16 23:11:31 Still ruins my life and Career for smoking it in my own home and answering the door to a cop who smelled it. It takes more than 180grams to make a Cannabutter Oil. Forced to get legal for medicinally. #Prejudiced #cndpoli
442 2018-10-16 23:11:28 no deja una
443 2018-10-16 23:11:28 Why aren’t you changing your own oil?
444 2018-10-16 23:11:14 I would like someone to explain the long term consequences of alienating one of our few friends in the Middle East: Saudi Arabia. How will it affect the price of oil and our sanctions on Iran to force them to suspend their terrorist activities throughout the region. 1/2
445 2018-10-16 23:11:10 I wish someone could change my oil.
446 2018-10-16 23:11:03 Same on this side of the hill. Epic shitshow even for an oil change.
447 2018-10-16 23:10:44 cant tear myself away...but have to do dishes now, laundry, halloween decorations (yard blow ups) Whiskey..and beer..I love whiskey..not much beer...an 7 year old Granddaughter that is smarter than I am....antifreeze..oil...fuck I don't want to trade my mower in for a snow shovel

449 2018-10-16 23:10:38 ‘Takes’ the benefit of oil rather ....
450 2018-10-16 23:10:37 Also the problem to online support groups (I find my supports online are best anon and in small numbers) is how easily they are manipulated by irresponsible parties. So many snake oil scam attempts going on, unless admin(s) is super vigilant.
451 2018-10-16 23:10:30 Not only do they exist, this one is especially dangerous. USA has sold itself out to it for a long time for oil and $$.
452 2018-10-16 23:10:25 I have a theory: The judge is perhaps a trump supporter. If I were to bribed someone to avoid public scandal, the judge would quickly find me guilty.
Trump is a modern-day medicine man. He can sell snake oil to anyone. My twin brother is like this.
453 2018-10-16 23:10:24 Oil change place has offered me a free soda, on one hand it’s free, on the other it’s practically a gateway drug to more soda...
454 2018-10-16 23:10:23 Next week: Trump pretends to believe #MBS ; Congress punishes #SaudiArabia; Trump assures MBS it's beyond his control; weapons deal stays intact; oil gets traded; both cont. to abuse power & commit #HumanRightsViolations .Rs look good for Nov 6 #TrumpConcentrationCamps #Khashoggi

457 2018-10-16 23:10:15 @CBCNews  As a medical user of cannabis, oil mostly, for chronic back pain & insomnia; it takes up to 5 hrs before it starts to work for me. I just want first time users to take it slow on edibles and oils.
458 2018-10-16 23:10:14 Mary anointed Jesus with alabaster oil. The oil was worth a year's salary. A perfume that expensive, would be worth about $58,000. This is a believer who treasures Jesus, humbled herself, and Christ exalts her. A worthy story to be told in the Gospel. (Matthew 26:6-13).
459 2018-10-16 23:10:08 No no it had a point

The Iraq war has made TRILLIONS for banksters and war profiteers amd oil companies

It has and is working exactly as intended
460 2018-10-16 23:10:07 RT @LivingSafely: #Lays Smooth #Ranch Dip this October? Top four ingredients are water, oil, modified tapioca and corn starch.
461 2018-10-16 23:10:03 A simple question we get a lot... "So, magnesium oil sounds great, how do you use it?"

1. Apply to skin
2. Rub it in

That's it! Your skin absorbs the magnesium in about 20-30 minutes to increase your overall #magnesium levels. 

#easy #selfcare #supplement
462 2018-10-16 23:09:58 You seem to have an obsession with Venezuela.  Is it because of their oil?

464 2018-10-16 23:09:45 my mom's carrot cake is also oil based (and iirc contains like 3x more oil)
465 2018-10-16 23:09:37 Wonderful.  That's just another reason for me to drive an oil burnin' pick up.  Hehehe
466 2018-10-16 23:09:34 Oh lawd. I gave up pork. Lol roast mine with olive oil.
467 2018-10-16 23:09:34 I get that we need Saudi Arabia as a counter balance to Iran but they can’t drink their oil and we shouldn’t lie for them or let them lie to us!
468 2018-10-16 23:09:16 On bus to Porirua now having found rose oil @CSOrganics jvl
469 2018-10-16 23:08:59 What particularly is so valuable & unique from England that we'd miss or can't get in easily from elsewhere in EU as a member?
Conversely, if England wants to keep having the oil, fresh water, electricity, and even food (inc fish) from Scotland, as it needs and gets now, just ask
470 2018-10-16 23:08:49 Well that was a great lesson in snake oil sales. Went to the Real Estate Elevated seminar and couldn’t help but feel the snakes in the water
471 2018-10-16 23:08:47 Sure, but it’s always been about the weapons sales and oil . . . and the family business.
472 2018-10-16 23:08:39 total spending for scotland was about 73bn

scottish budget was about 33bn

the 40bn difference was spent on pensions, welfare, defence, international aid - scotlands share for the last 2 
and also debt interest payments

scottish revenue was £60bn including oil revenue
473 2018-10-16 23:08:27 I bought coconut oil cause it’s better for your skin than using makeup wipes and now I’ve blinded myself 
474 2018-10-16 23:08:20 Falinski in HOR speaking about gift card bill to change expiry date to 3 years. 
He likened it to taking on Big Tobacco and Big Oil.  WOW!
475 2018-10-16 23:08:18 I have a Maserati as well, $515 oil change. You have no other option as to use the dealer.
476 2018-10-16 23:07:38 For youthful skin, mix 1 cup brown sugar, 1/8 cup olive oil, 1/8 cup oatmeal, 1/4 cup mashed figs, 1 oz vanilla. Leave on 20 mins.
477 2018-10-16 23:07:37 If you can't issue licences for whale oil in the Falkland Islands..
THEN YOU CAN'T BE IN BLOODY CONTROL OF SAID ISLANDS..
Twas an act of sovereignty, recognised by the Americans..
And I agree wholeheartedly, the argies have no legal basis whasoever..
Thank you..
478 2018-10-16 23:07:37 Good things to buy - lentils for daal, rice, baked beans, reduced bread and reduced section in general, wonky carrots, pasta and chopped toms, tinned sardines, milk. Could have rice with milk for breakfast? If do buy oats, sugar and veg oil (cheaper than butter) - make flapjacks.
479 2018-10-16 23:07:28 ていかーさんおはごですー！

きっと当選してると信じて…
480 2018-10-16 23:07:22 Tho, on second thoughts, had the Scots had full control of the Oil....yes I think a good chance they'd have followed or led Norway in creating a growth fund.
481 2018-10-16 23:07:20 She put her left arm in oil. She is legitimately America’s property
482 2018-10-16 23:07:13 Teaching my younger brother how to change his oil for the first time at age 16 and I'm thinking to myself wow I learned how to do this when I was 10.
483 2018-10-16 23:07:12 In WSJ B10, China rejects US oil to zero. WSJ failed to say the government of China did this. Do we need more proof that China is the biggest enemy of the American people and the world. This midterm we will vote for @GOP & @realDonaldTrump to fight Democrats Globalists. #MAGA
484 2018-10-16 23:07:10 CBD oil is the best!
485 2018-10-16 23:07:08 “Did they walk to Alberta” is a moronic argument. It’s too similar to the “Why don’t you give up your computer and phone that are made from oil and that are combustible fuel sources that for some reason Albertans are burning to heat their homes with and releasing carbon from?”
486 2018-10-16 23:07:03 That oil of Olay has always caught my attention! I might go w that one as well
487 2018-10-16 23:06:48 So I take it having twice as much as I would legally for medicinal counts me out and ruins my Career just for smoking it in my own home. Sounds Fair...NOT!!! 180 grams is nothing when you make Cannabutter Oil. #cndpoli
488 2018-10-16 23:06:36 Agreed! There’s so much to this. What are their options if proven? Do we risk oil etc. or do we demand justice for those involved? Do you think us demanding to call for a new regime is realistic?
489 2018-10-16 23:06:34 Your foundation is more than likely mixing with your moisturiser, if ones oil based and ones water based it’ll separate on your face 
490 2018-10-16 23:06:27 But oil and weapons! Am I right or wat?!?
491 2018-10-16 23:06:21 Damn, I worked hardcore overtime once & used every cent left over from my paycheck after rent and bills to splurge on Good Genes and Luna Oil. I used up GG hoping it would finally do something for my skin -  it didn't - and still have half a bottle of Luna collecting dust. Gross.
492 2018-10-16 23:06:14 @HarleyMexico hola!  Sabrán el contacto  distribuidor en CDMX que me pudiese ayudar a conseguir la siguiente pieza: OIL LOCK PIECE - 46609-06, por favor.
493 2018-10-16 23:06:04 But oil of Olay’s regenerist is pretty good as well. I loved it. & @cher’s pick 
494 2018-10-16 23:05:59 I'm really hoping this cbd oil helps with my insomnia. I've heard really good things about it. 
495 2018-10-16 23:05:57 剥けなくてもかわいいけど剥けてもかわいいと思います！！ぼくも剥けるので仲間じゃないですかー！
496 2018-10-16 23:05:47 If you can, stop using it and get another cleanser. Products for oily skin, usually have ingredients to help decrease/control oil production. Use a toner to help restore pH level and then use a good moisturizer. I’d suggest looking into products that contain hyaluronic acid.
497 2018-10-16 23:05:41 if someone can hook me up w a barrel of crude oil hmu
498 2018-10-16 23:05:35 Recall:
- Opioid crisis.
- Record oil discount.
- NO PIPELINES. 
- High unemployment. 
- Worthless "social licence".
But what we really need is CDN tax money going to some billionaire who can give a % of it back in form of glorified concrete pond. 

Please call an election soon.
499 2018-10-16 23:05:33 Yes with agriculture including the growth of vegetables & grains, harvest via oil burning machines, then transported via truck. #Buylocal
500 2018-10-16 23:05:32 Kalau exfonya pake lip scrub bukan diy gpp?

502 2018-10-16 23:05:12    One day I’ll make you my chocolate olive oil cake. (No flour, made with almonds. Cayenne optional;)
503 2018-10-16 23:05:09 the fries aren’t cooked in peanut oil if that helps
504 2018-10-16 23:05:07 More lies! Taxes on oil production make up a minuscule amount of our tax revenues. Read the nonpartisan ballot analysis.
505 2018-10-16 23:05:06 He looks like he drinks nutri bullet smoothies evey morning made of free range Coeliacs disease labwork. And coconut finger oil. He moisturises by sweating.
506 2018-10-16 23:04:50 Saudi Arabia has a lot to do with Iran & Nov sanctions with oil. Prices are high now and will go higher. Kushner is personally involved by mid peace deal, that will blow up. Kushner is involved in arms deal. These aren’t coincidences. Mid East is about to get worse
507 2018-10-16 23:04:47 I mean where else are we gonna get our oil? Iran? Venezuela? Russia?
508 2018-10-16 23:04:47 I obviously know baby oil doesn’t go in cars let me say that before the fake mechanics be in my mentions

510 2018-10-16 23:04:41 Oil and $$$$
511 2018-10-16 23:04:41 Wtf is your point mate? We are discussing prior control. No one, apart from you, has even mentioned bloody oil. The point we are making is (and assuming you are a falklander you'll agree) that the argies have no legal basis for any sovereignty claim.
512 2018-10-16 23:04:39 Royal family? Big business? Oil industry? The police? They’re all gangsters and they rule our world.
513 2018-10-16 23:04:38 diffusing lavender oil and taken my meds + a beta blocker + took cbd oil + i have my anxiety book + i have my little fairy lights turned on I swear to Fuckin god

519 2018-10-16 23:04:02 The NRDC spent years in the National Enhanced Oil Recovery Initiative 'broad coalition' only to pull out when #45Q tax credits were secured. #coal #EOR #CCUS

521 2018-10-16 23:03:57 the dealership used to play with me until I cursed the lady out for telling me my oil change was $50 more than what I know it is. like bitch don’t play with me this is a Honda you could put baby oil in this mf and it’s gon find a way to run.

524 2018-10-16 23:03:20 Have you ever been enraged to the point of wondering what would happen if you were to squeeze a plastic toy? Would it turn into something similar to a diamond or revert back to oil? 
525 2018-10-16 23:03:17 When the US govt. AND Israel tell Saudi Arabia to go take a hike with their Oil and money that's when Terrorist attacks across the world will drop drastically within' 10 years. The schools outside Saudi Arabia that exspouse the NONSENSE known as Wahbism, their funding will dry up
526 2018-10-16 23:03:13 Arms deals. Saudis throwing money at Trump and his businesses. Oil. Favours. Cash incentives etc etc etc = sweep it under the carpet.
527 2018-10-16 23:03:10 serious question: does anyone know if you can take CBD oil on an airplane if it has no THC? checked bag or carry on, doesn’t matter, I just wanna bring it with me @TSA @AskTSA
528 2018-10-16 23:03:05 Can I trade places w/ the idiot in Canada who thinks private/US healthcare is better and hates Justin Trudeau for downsizing his oil/gas job? Is that a thing and not just a movie? #facetious

530 2018-10-16 23:02:57 Your constant misoginist insults around womens apperances is even more offensive, not because you are the President but, because you aint, nor ever have been, an oil painting yourself! Look in the mirror man and check YOURSELF before you check anyone else!
531 2018-10-16 23:02:53 I hate being a girl & hormonal. 

The guy just told me how much it’s gonna be for and oil change and said I needed to replace my brake pads and the price. 

I started crying rn. Wtf.
532 2018-10-16 23:02:36 STOP BUYING VENEZUELAN OIL ! STOP SELLING FUEL TO MADURO’S REGIME . NO MORE MONEY FOR HIS CRIMINAL REGIME
533 2018-10-16 23:02:35 CBD oil treats for my old lady doghter have been a game changer. #shesback #14yearsyoung 
534 2018-10-16 23:02:35 Indeed, but of course there are swathes of this planet that both Republicans and Democrats deem expendable - primarily ones which might theoretically interfere with the flow of oil to the US. Currently Yemen, Palestine & Syria, with Iran next on the list.
535 2018-10-16 23:02:29 Treated the cats for fleas last night, yet again....this time in addition to using the blue Dawn dish soap I put coconut oil (recommend by my cousin) all over their fur and down to the skin. I haven't seen a single flea on them all day!!!

539 2018-10-16 23:02:17 Bad news to those addicted to sanction: 
In the first six months of Iranian calendar year (21 March-21 September 2018):
-Iran’s non-oil exports: US$ 23.1 billion (increased by 13%)
-Imports: US$ 22.2 billion
-Non-oil trade balance surplus: US$ 945 million
540 2018-10-16 23:02:05 I mean should we be surprised by a brand that added blue coloring to a bunch of oil for the aesthetic and charged over $100 for it
541 2018-10-16 23:02:04 good luck buddy. I didn't make any moves today. still short vxx ,  short spxs, short oil, nat gas, and long EEM and silver LOL
what a mix !
542 2018-10-16 23:02:03 Now if only we were prepared to be independent when it comes to oil, we'd have some actual leverage over the Saudi's. I guess there's no  way to make that happen, eh?
543 2018-10-16 23:01:54 ありがとございます
544 2018-10-16 23:01:52 LMAO I don't need troll anything. I just want answers. You see that's the problem - anybody who questions you is a troll and on the oil and gas payroll
545 2018-10-16 23:01:38 I took my car to get an oil change and these mfs opening my trunk and looking around..... foh I have all my stripper shoes and buttplugs just laying back there 
546 2018-10-16 23:01:34 Untouchable. Nothing will happen. Oil Money has it’s own currency, the price of “Untouchable”! Jobs and goods before Anyone’s Life... @SecPompeo @Jeremy_Hunt @UN @RT_Erdogan

549 2018-10-16 23:01:25 Mom and I had a long chat about oils. I tried THC oil post-op from the hysterectomy. Didn't do much for me, I'm afraid.
550 2018-10-16 23:01:19 Best meal plan -if anyone doesn't know where to start: Big bowl of Green Salads with 1 piece of grass fed meat and some coconut oil or ghee.
551 2018-10-16 23:01:02 AND we gotta keep that oil in the ground.

556 2018-10-16 23:00:18 So if the British were not in control..
Then why or how could they issue licences to hunt whales, seals and Penguins for the oil..?
Furthermore, if it wasn't a British possession and in their control, why would the Americans pay these licence fees..?

563 2018-10-16 22:59:56 gosh darn it I'm like a magical talking car still being fixed up in the mechanics cause I ran out of oil when I really just wanna get out on the roads and cruise the seaside cliffs! coincidentally I'm actually not allowed to drive for about a week. I need to get out the house.
564 2018-10-16 22:59:52 So if you don’t think transporting oil by pipeline is the right thing to do, how would you transport it?

566 2018-10-16 22:59:47 @realDonaldTrump here's how you respond to Saudi Arabia: commit to cutting off the import of their oil supply and to making up that deficit with clean energy. Let them know we won't be held hostage to their oil and prices... Take the cards out of their hands, and back into ours.
567 2018-10-16 22:59:27 I had never seen this before:
There were fried wings under a heat lamp. To reheat them (or possibly finish cooking them) they deep “fried” them in this hot vat of oil. 
568 2018-10-16 22:59:22 Um, "It was locker room talk?" Okay, how about "Boys will be boys?" Perhaps, "I'm a business man. He sells oil..." Maybe, "Look, I don't condone what he says, but who am I try to change him?" Or, "My investigators are finding all kinds of things?" Finally, "But her emails!"
569 2018-10-16 22:59:13 My baby is due for it’s first oil change tomorrow
570 2018-10-16 22:59:02 My hair looks gross but its really because there’s a shit ton of coconut oil in it
571 2018-10-16 22:58:57 saudi citizen on saudi soil gets killed by saudi govt, other than a stern warning, what is the world gonna do? i don't think there is any recourse, unless the world wants $200 oil overnite.
572 2018-10-16 22:58:56 I refuse to take my car to the dealership for repairs anymore. they’ll charge you $7,000 for an oil change if you let them
573 2018-10-16 22:58:53 My oil change 85 dollars I’m sick with it going into depression mode 
574 2018-10-16 22:58:46 I'll bring the baby oil...

579 2018-10-16 22:58:09 We hate Saudi Arabia but you can't just pull the plug on oil just yet that's what happens when you have spent years depending on their oil.
China tariffs make money sanctions don't.
They will cut a deal to clean this up and we won't forget.

581 2018-10-16 22:57:49 Oh most def he ain’t getting ass for a minute. He better get real acquainted with that baby oil
582 2018-10-16 22:57:49 Well how they make it in Italy. They used pine nuts,basil,coarse salt,Parmesan cheese,pecorino cheese & olive oil  I’m going to make  it this weekend
583 2018-10-16 22:57:45 6/ however , given the international and super powers policies and regional power interest Even if the IndeRef was not held ! Still the Iran and Iraq gov would have attacked Kirkuk and took over oil fields under the blind eyes of USA and West as Iraq needed to sell oil to pay .
584 2018-10-16 22:57:37 Watch, they figure it out as soon as we call them out on it . But, I noticed that in 2016-17, the Oil had great puck support all over the ice, especially in the D zone. They were great early in that season in that regard. Last year, that support was nowhere to be seen
585 2018-10-16 22:57:26 You love going to work right? We got people on oil rigs sitting there weeks at a time away from families & nobody crying about that shit. Just cut the BS out. We acting like they been away from their families like they're in the military or something for years. It was a few weeks

592 2018-10-16 22:57:01 Oil companies would pay $150k-$200k easy. That goes a long way in Houston
593 2018-10-16 22:56:58 I’m going to need a link. I googled and googled while getting my oil changed.
594 2018-10-16 22:56:57 The oil show needs to be over. Now.
595 2018-10-16 22:56:55 This is the new normal for US. The Saudis buy US arms and buy Saudi Oil..... where has your moral compass gone America.
596 2018-10-16 22:56:51 @nailogical My 100% jojoba oil just came in the mail. Im trusting your tips to help my nails stop breaking. Then maybe i can follow one of your ancient tutorials.

601 2018-10-16 22:56:07 Yes we could be but there is no evidence that we are. Pretending that it's settled Science when it isn't is no better than selling snake oil to cure your cold. It may actually cure your cold but there is no evidence to support that claim.
602 2018-10-16 22:56:03 If you stopped buying oil then others would get it cheaper, what else would happen? Not sure about the self-sufficient thing as you eat like pigs and need loads of hormones to have that kind of meat, but whatever makes you happy. Make the world a favor and become an island
603 2018-10-16 22:55:57 we have more than enough shale oil to withstand an oil weapon
604 2018-10-16 22:55:48 Bottle poppin like champs in here. Its your Official Oil Show Party Headquarters going off the rails right now. Get here and party
605 2018-10-16 22:55:44 Oil stocks will crash in this weekend. Not exactly.　　石油株は今週末に暴落するだろう。いや、そうでもないよ。
606 2018-10-16 22:55:41 Only reason I didn’t like them was because I have a sensitive face so it produces more dirt and oil when I get stuff like that. I usually wake up everyday with crust in my eyes so I didn’t realize I wouldn’t be able to clean my eyes when I woke up everyday which drove me nuts
607 2018-10-16 22:55:39 Yes. And you've convinced us all your a oil n gas troll. 

Stop wasting ppls time n obstructing climate action.

609 2018-10-16 22:55:25 Of course he said that. His handlers reminded him of the "importance" of the highly profitable oil and weapons bidness
610 2018-10-16 22:55:23 It is EXACTLY the same as the Liberal plan: Sign treaties we never respect, tax energy for all Canadian consumers & producers, buy pipelines for billions, then give oil elites the public tax dollars in corporate welfare.

"You better hid that big ass forehead"
613 2018-10-16 22:55:05 Because lots of countries sell arms to Saudi Arabia and also buy oil from them
614 2018-10-16 22:55:02 Bueno ese market sentiment es difícil de descifrar para mi, you are the expert. I just try to understand the market and to make my best guess on oil price prediction to assess Venezuelan crude oils
615 2018-10-16 22:55:00 The way the perceived looters are ganging up against Bubu is curious. Bubu must be doing something right.  Because I know this Atikulated movement is definitely not about the people but rather interests. Intels, Discos, Oil Well leases e.t.c
616 2018-10-16 22:54:54 Last time someone told me to use tea tree oil for my face and I broke out something stupid, took a month for the witch hazel to repair the damages. Could you guys please say what brand of tea tree oil I should be using to become gorgeous, like why’s that hard 
617 2018-10-16 22:54:49 It’s false flag sting operation being conducted to generate hatred against the Saudis who have reciently threatened to sell international oil futures in non-us dollar denominated currency and use mkt manipulation to increase oil prices
618 2018-10-16 22:54:46 How does lower gas prices keep us hooked on oil, exactly?
619 2018-10-16 22:54:40 Not to mention the $80 per bbl oil the world buys from these a-holes.  And Canada can’t get much more than $30?  Can you say #canadagettingscrewed ?
620 2018-10-16 22:54:37 water based generally is healthier and doesn’t destroy sheets. but gun oil is the only silicon based lube i can tolerate

622 2018-10-16 22:54:12 It has helped me get off both of my anxiety meds. Everyone's body reacts differently to CBD Oil. All you can do is try for yourself and see.

625 2018-10-16 22:54:02 Um, Congress? The president is about to ignore the government-sanctioned murder of a journalist so that he can move forward with his Iran sanctions and give the Saudi’s a sweet oil deal in the process. You ok with that? #Saudi
626 2018-10-16 22:53:58 Empty threats from #MBS_murderer & his #Wahhabi terrorists!
If KSA oil prices sky-rocketed, all oil fields would be put back into Full use, depending if KSA seen as 'more of a threat' than #Venezuela & #Iran & #Russia were treated more amenably by the west - Which they should be!
627 2018-10-16 22:53:52 FYI the US doesn't have free markets. We have Crapitalism. Not to be confused with capitalism. In Crapitalism the government meddles with the free market so much that everything is distorted and works like a car with no oil.  "Too big to fail", minimum wage laws ect...
628 2018-10-16 22:53:51 Papa, you got yourself in hot water by taking more than you could chew; you got caught & pleaded guilty; it’s OVER! Are you 12? No one takes you seriously; go away; become a painter, a farmer, a vineyard owner, an olive oil producer; anything else but politics & foreign intrigue.
629 2018-10-16 22:53:50 Majaira kunyeperwa...some will soon sell their cars to stock cooking oil.
630 2018-10-16 22:53:47 Was that because they had oil on the land? I recall reading about the Osage murders because some white ppl were jealous of their wealth.
631 2018-10-16 22:53:34 These are the best if the oil is hot. Best done in a dutch oven.
632 2018-10-16 22:53:21 Witch hazel breaks me out. Aloe works. I’m using that & neutrogena along w|coconut oil to get rid of dark spots.
633 2018-10-16 22:52:56 It will be legal and yes it is good for pain. I have had two brain surgeries...my surgeon allowed me cannabis oil only, not his meds and nothing else the day of surgery and afterwards.  Cannabis saved me from a massive bag of pills and whatever poison in my system for that.

636 2018-10-16 22:52:40 $928 for 4 tires, $84.95 for an oil change, $79 for an alignment, $159 for rear brakes........ But now my “Ebony” will be good for a while.

638 2018-10-16 22:52:35 I'm not sure what your point is here as no one has even mentioned oil. The specific point is that the Falklands have only had Argentina in 'control' on two occasions before '82. These were aug 1829 when no country was in prior control and Dec 1832 in similar circumstances.

641 2018-10-16 22:52:28 They don't consider the rest of us as human. Much like Saudi oil, we're a resource to be used up and cast aside in their eyes.
642 2018-10-16 22:52:18 Like the moral compass of all the tech companies, chemical/oil companies polluting the env't, tax cuts being used for stock buy backs & adding $ to C level pay?

644 2018-10-16 22:52:02 No prob not trying to be jerk. Have listened to all of ur podcast w/ Paul & Jerry from day 1 & still listen to funny episodes. Im sure ratings are  but as one of the few loyal ppl just miss the more real/personal side of u guys. Bagel Store, Oil Changes, Ordering Food.
645 2018-10-16 22:52:01 You say that, but it does still apply because most are no longer unionized. Take oil fields for instance, yes they have OSHA safety, but they are AGGRESSIVELY anti union. That being said, a desk job at 100 hours is jack compared to oilfield 100+
646 2018-10-16 22:51:57 Nah I'm about to fix no car I might change the oil though
647 2018-10-16 22:51:54 also, by "befriending" KSA, we have a counter-weight in ME from Iran (and the horrible Iran Deal) and their terrorist proxies.  Also oil, probably.

649 2018-10-16 22:51:52 I make these whenever my favorite munchkins sleep over. Fill brown bags with powdered sugar or cinnamon sugar... Plop them in the bags fresh from the oil and have them shake, shake, shake. Or, make a chocolate or peanut butter glaze... Or... Well, I made a maple bacon one once...
650 2018-10-16 22:51:50 It also seems like it serves Prince Bone Saw’s purpose to silence the opposition, since the American Idiot is signaling thru his jolly pompous proxy that the arms will flow as long as the oil does.
651 2018-10-16 22:51:50 Getting my oil changed like a damn adult. 

Only put it off for like 8 days longer than I should have.

655 2018-10-16 22:51:36 Too bad we don't have a pipeline east so that we could replace Saudi oil with our own...
656 2018-10-16 22:51:35 Don't be surprise if the price of oil goes up
657 2018-10-16 22:51:35 CA gas prices are relatively 60 cents more than the national average. That price is not dictated by oil companies. You can blame your local government.
658 2018-10-16 22:51:31 Name me one time that a drop in cost has ever led to a company lowering its prices. Price per barrel of oil plummeted yet we paid more. Companies pass cost increases on to the consumer. Always. It's capitalism.
659 2018-10-16 22:51:30 That country that points at Iran for terrorism because they don't want Iran's oil to lower Saudi prices and power? That country?
660 2018-10-16 22:51:19 Oh no! Can you imagine a world where Conservatives can't run ads attacking immigrants, disguising tax cuts for the rich, and caping for oil companies?

668 2018-10-16 22:50:47 This is cronyism. Sure, Tesla and SpaceX benefit from cronyism too. I'd prefer we get rid of cronyism, we should rid of oil subsidies as well as solar subsidies, but the level that both the left and right support cronyism leaves me very skeptical for future prosperity.

672 2018-10-16 22:50:35 I don't, to be honest. If they're a legit private organization that only certifies real olive oil, then I give all credit to them. All I know is most olive oils are total scams and are cut with soybean oil and the like.
673 2018-10-16 22:50:21 Agree with all this. Yamo’s 12 games show he’s not ready, Oil can’t wait much longer before doing right thing. Puli less so, now, but yep. Isn’t kids’ fault Oil has nothing behind them. Isn’t enough reason to retard their development. Not winning in ‘19, with ‘em or without ‘em.
674 2018-10-16 22:50:18 It's a piece of junk, it's probably losing capabilities with the new towers.
675 2018-10-16 22:50:16 Or...we could choose to rebuild our infrastructure, update our Ag, move to safer vehicles, with 1/200th the moving parts, and reduce our military costs, incurred in keeping oil lanes open, at a savings of $5 trillion per decade, employing millions, for 2 generations.  
676 2018-10-16 22:50:06 also, i should note that this is my preference for raw sex. for condoms, i do lube of course... gun oil preferably
677 2018-10-16 22:50:00 On the orders of GWBush. It's as if the Saudis found someone more clueless and opportunistic than the Bushes and cast them aside. Bushes were always oil people. Saudis attacked us in 9/11, Bush attacked Iraq. WTF?
678 2018-10-16 22:49:58 You can't always pick your allies. In this case, it's a geopolitical necessity to ally with KSM against Iran/RUS & to protect the flow of oil to our allies in Asia & prevent Iran/RUS/China from becoming the dominant player in region. Can't be viewed myopically. Pick your poison.
679 2018-10-16 22:49:55 $70 oil changes smh.

Oil break out. Nuff said
682 2018-10-16 22:49:29 So are we, without firm proof, going to go after an key partner in the Middle East, and major oil supplier.  Trump is playing this right, let it play out before accusing another nation.

688 2018-10-16 22:48:55 CBD oil is very good for anxiety, stress, etc.  It's also helped with my epilepsy.  And no worries about failing a drug test because it doesn't contain enough THC to get you high.

690 2018-10-16 22:48:48 His point is that Saudi can only buy weapons because they have money from oil WHICH WE BUY. That’s the heart of the issue. They’ll get the bombs. But the money and the power they have is because we buy their oil. And we are all complicit. Understand?
691 2018-10-16 22:48:31 lets not forget Americas part in this ...they want to control the Venezuela's oil...Venezuela won't let them...........
692 2018-10-16 22:48:29 実はめちゃくちゃ失礼なことについ最近まで「OILさんて何の作者さんだっけ……」って思ってた。作品一覧見たら「あーっ当時欲しかったけど買えなかった本の作者！？ウワーーーーーーーッ光栄すぎる」ってなって死んだ
693 2018-10-16 22:48:19 寝落ちした！！！！！！！！おはよう！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！

Vegan: Mediterranean vegan shepherds pie with sweet potato parsnip mash, sage oil & crispy fried sage. 
696 2018-10-16 22:47:44 Weird how almost all funding is from out of the area oil interests (per the No on G flyer I got today in the mail). Read the fine print  on the ads then read the text of the measure.
697 2018-10-16 22:47:38 Lmaoo! Deadass! And engine oil
698 2018-10-16 22:47:36 the amount of oil companies willing to pay more than a hundred dollars an hour for my husband to sit in his truck for days on end waiting for shit to be ready for him to inspect is fucking mindboggling. 12 hour days just sitting there. wild.
699 2018-10-16 22:47:35 Had to turn down a couple senior teams because I’m not playing for anyone until the goddamn Edmonton oil Kings give me my t shirt and cut me so I can complete my WHL Alberta tour
700 2018-10-16 22:47:34 Nope. Saudis controlan Motiva. Y seguiran trayendo su oil. El riesgo geopolitico no es physical trading de oil pal
701 2018-10-16 22:47:28 Sabah derse gitmeden bi buçuk saat önce kalkıyorum diye niye deniliyo benim yarım saat oil pullingim var zaten
702 2018-10-16 22:47:26 Super disappointed.  but good genes did help with my texture, redness and acne, not so much my pores. In case anyone was wondering. I never tried the ufo oil though.
703 2018-10-16 22:47:16 Black Castor Oil did wonders to my beard 
704 2018-10-16 22:47:12 Currently its refinery shut downs that are driving the differential. Smart investors saw this in the spring and got out of oil then. Probably are buying back in now. Once the refineries are back up the pricing will recover. Kenney probably saw it coming too and timed this.
705 2018-10-16 22:47:11 Corporate America is getting brownie points for canceling “Davos in the Desert” appearances.

But has even a single U.S. company with investment from the Saudi Public Investment Fund announced plans to return that capital?

They all stink of blood oil money.
706 2018-10-16 22:47:07 How come everyone is now acting appalled at Saudi Arabia, they have been one of the most oppressive societies in the world for a long time. But on the other hand they sold us cheaper oil..........
707 2018-10-16 22:47:05 Adding peppermint oil in my hot cocoa makes me feel so good.
708 2018-10-16 22:47:03 2019 Oil Market Prospects: End of Ants Sanctions, NOPEC Breaks OPEC
709 2018-10-16 22:47:01 If you remember just a year back or so Goldman, at $30 a barrel, was saying Oil may touch at $ 20 a barrel I am still waiting for what they have to say at $80.
710 2018-10-16 22:47:00 How about "you're never guilty if you have lots of oil".
711 2018-10-16 22:46:59 What's next? How about women out of the military? Perhaps remove gun controls? What about oil drilling in the Great Barrier Reef - we're killing it off anyway. Then there's that pesky Franklin River. Could use a dam there.
712 2018-10-16 22:46:55 トーン使って遊ぶとか言っといて厚塗りやり始めるからよくわかんない
713 2018-10-16 22:46:54 How about just raising the minimum on which social security is paid? All those folks over ~$115 another couple dollars a pay period is chump change. I was one of them for years.  In the oil business bonuses are paid in March; way over HALF of the employees are DONE paying SS!!
714 2018-10-16 22:46:42 Going for the aggrieved oil sheikh demographic.
715 2018-10-16 22:46:34 Wish somebody told me what kind of trip I would be on when you heat oil on tinfoil, and suck it up with a straw. Lol
716 2018-10-16 22:46:30 So I just got a text saying that my Kia is qualified for free maintenance and oil changes but I don’t have a Kia so do you think they’ll accept a scion instead? Cause that’d be nice
717 2018-10-16 22:46:22 cuticle oil does miracles...
718 2018-10-16 22:46:21 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, yet total chaos and lawlessness.
719 2018-10-16 22:46:12 1st cleanser is using oil cleanser (ada i bagi my top 3 in the next tweet) cuz oil melts all the dirt amd sunblock and makeup.

Then baru use normal low pH cleanser. High pH cleanser is mot really good for ur skin in the long run.
720 2018-10-16 22:46:00 US is becoming more and more oil producing country like canada , potentially having competition with canada . Recent canada's struggle seems structural problem and hard to be solved .
721 2018-10-16 22:45:37 because we are addicted to oil. We need to kiss Saudi ass to get it. That's why there was never any appropriate punishment for 9/11.

I own a car, so I'm complicit. There's no way around that fact.
722 2018-10-16 22:45:18 What in the Wide Wide World of Sports is going on with fuel prices? More wells pumping than in early 80’s and price around $2.80 a gallon for regular gas. What’s the point of domestic oil if paying Saudi prices? Why are we selling oil off shore if we can’t produce enough 4 US?A 1
723 2018-10-16 22:45:10 go weed but no rello mkay i was tryna give my oil a lil break but fuck it

727 2018-10-16 22:44:35 Seriously though. Get a bowl of hot water and add loads of olbas oil. Put a towel over your head, and breath it in. Normally works 
728 2018-10-16 22:44:33 is fighting there and shows that Saudi Arabia will go to alliance with Russia and China. Will it succeed? 4. Will he convince the US obscurantist forces that want Saudi oil and Saudi gold? Told them that Saudi Arabia
729 2018-10-16 22:44:29 Can anyone recommend a good heating place to purchase oil..... NOT Wilson’s though I just had to cuss them out 
730 2018-10-16 22:44:23 I just cured a melanoma with rick simpson oil!

732 2018-10-16 22:44:17 It's almost like Saudi Arabia is a country with horrible ethics and abuses of rights that superpowers let slide cos they have tonnes of oil
733 2018-10-16 22:44:06 I need someone to show up with wings and massage oil. Ooh
734 2018-10-16 22:44:02 I’d rather do without the oil
735 2018-10-16 22:43:58 Clove oil for the tooth 
736 2018-10-16 22:43:56 Sea transport really isn't much better, it's just less in your face, and because it is generally thought to be essential people are a lot more fatalistic about it.  Mostly in the press only when oil prices are high and companies retire the most inefficient ships.
737 2018-10-16 22:43:54 I loveeee my oil diffuser. I can smell my room before I even get down the hall to go in it 
738 2018-10-16 22:43:48 Fck off you absolute liar..UK is supplying munitions and intelligence to KSA to perpetrate this disaster for a free oil line from Iraq, Syria and Iran to the gulf..hello, we know the plot

741 2018-10-16 22:43:25 So I have to put oil on my face to help with my dry skin but the oil is now causing me to break out so now I have combination skin 
742 2018-10-16 22:43:19 The GOP old guard is retiring rich with big oil, coal, and NRA $. They couldn't care a whit about the planet becoming a briquette. There grandchildren will suffer.
743 2018-10-16 22:43:10 Sorry folks I don’t agree ;if Saudi hikes oil the US will seek cheaper alternatives,  that will drive quick completion of Keystone and allow Canadian oil to flow south at lower cost and that alone should help rather than hinder Canadian economy - happy 2 hear your opposite view
744 2018-10-16 22:43:10 That oil money
745 2018-10-16 22:43:06 One Word - Oil.
746 2018-10-16 22:42:56 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
747 2018-10-16 22:42:37 Trumpanzees had a great response to your story:  "There's no cooling system to freeze or leak or flush and refill. There's no water pump. There's no oil pump. There's no valves to foul." Etc. Etc.
748 2018-10-16 22:42:30 I know how that is. Majority of the year my room smells like grease and oil. I guess its because i build little steam gadgets in my room. The trick is the little rivets are a pain to make. But it goes good. Sadly all of my creations are fails.
749 2018-10-16 22:42:27 I bought some new Gold Bond lotion with shea butter cocoa butter and coconut oil or oh my goodness
750 2018-10-16 22:42:04 its ok to have no money. its ok to have a small dick. its ok to drive a 03 Camry that needs a oil change
751 2018-10-16 22:42:02 If we are not looking to the penultimate coming of the Lord Jesus then the marriage super is not for us.

Dress yourself for the Bridegroom, have enough oil in ur lamps to escape the trubulation.

Jesus comes as a their in the night.

Escape the tribulation
752 2018-10-16 22:42:02 I support @YesOn1631. Big Oil doesn’t care about us and we don’t buy their BS about Initiative 1631 in Washington State. It’s time to hold Big Oil accountable. #YesOn1631 #waelex [Via @CivicAction]

754 2018-10-16 22:41:47 On top of that Trump is not a patriotic America bc the 9/11 attackers were from Saudi Arabia and Trump Stands behind the Saudi King bc he is putting money into his hotels and businesses. Trump is a snake oil salesman #DonTheCon45
755 2018-10-16 22:41:44 The sad truth is no matter how grim the situation gets in Yemen, due to Saudi Oil & Saudi weapons deals giving them huge influence in Westminster, our current Govt will refuse to stand up to them & that will remain the case until we've a different Govt that puts people b4 profit
756 2018-10-16 22:41:41 "Bought into" my ass.  Quit making them sound like dupes instead of the lying snake oil salesmen they are.

760 2018-10-16 22:41:11 He doesn't want to go into Saudi King's mind but eventually oil and gas forces him in and even beyond, thanks to 'rogue killers'.
761 2018-10-16 22:40:59 What are we talking about BH, Herdsmen or Financial crisis chose one let's deliberate on objectively. Is the same BH dat carried out attacks in Abuja btw 2011- 2014 UN building, police headquarters, madala etc or the militants dat destroyed pipelines dat grounded the oil to

765 2018-10-16 22:40:10 I made a mixture of shea butter, coconut oil and almond oil, melted together. I only got minor, pale stretch marks.
766 2018-10-16 22:40:07 サラダ油って体に悪いんですか？サラダなのに？
767 2018-10-16 22:40:06 Does anybody know if CBD oil will be legal tomorrow? I hear it is great for muscular pain.
768 2018-10-16 22:40:00 If the salsa got a dookie green tint to it, be cautious. If it's red and oil based be weary.
769 2018-10-16 22:39:53 I don't get how people can't see through the facade of snake oil salesman like Trump. May ALL of Trump supporters wake up and turn on their brain and open their eyes. See the lying, self serving conman that he is. He doesn't care about YOU. He's using you to get what he wants.
770 2018-10-16 22:39:50 Oil if I buy them, dried and toasted bud if I make them.
771 2018-10-16 22:39:32 I had one serving of cooked quinoa, I sautéed half a bell pepper and olive oil with chili powder and paprika powder, once those were cooked I added black beans salsa and guacamole
772 2018-10-16 22:39:27 These people never accept that Saudi killed journalist #Khashoggi . They wear mask of human rights but from decades US aid Saudi crime. They don’t dare to speak truth for oil. Shame on you @realDonaldTrump
773 2018-10-16 22:39:22 I’m going to do an oil painting of myself

775 2018-10-16 22:38:49 Put a fresh water embargo on the Saudis...
dehydrate their royal Wahabi asses..
The Saudi royal family is the most evil institution on earth...
Unlike North Korea..they pretend to be our friends..that's the muslim creed..deception, in the name of Allah..
No water in..no oil out !
776 2018-10-16 22:38:42 If you couldn't see he was a snake oil salesman, especially after his encouragement of violence at early primary rallies, you need to back up and look at things more objectively.
777 2018-10-16 22:38:33 I NEED to get into oil paint/buy the supplies
778 2018-10-16 22:38:30 Tone Brothers Inc. was apparently acquired over a decade ago. Pretty sure alcohol would turn oil of lemon into straight up biodiesel
779 2018-10-16 22:38:27 I love putting this VS coconut oil on but I hate being so slippery

781 2018-10-16 22:38:17 I love the people at my local sub shop. Just right amount of sass, spice, grease, oil and love.
782 2018-10-16 22:37:56 #Farmers Trump & Pense care nothing about farmers. They pretend to not know that Oil carbon emissions will bring worse weather disasters in the future. They subsidize oil energy but attempt to cut support for renewable energies, all for the sake of Oil Profits. Welcome to reality
783 2018-10-16 22:37:51 OIL.
784 2018-10-16 22:37:43 Two friends I recommended it too didn't like it either, it's definitely divisive. I don't know why I love it so much
785 2018-10-16 22:37:28 C-P-C has signed an agreement with an Indonesia's state-run oil and gas company to build a naphtha cracker plant in the country.

787 2018-10-16 22:37:22 Thursday price changes. All data now in: Heating, stove oil and Diesel all to drop by two cents a litre. Gasoline to drop by five cents even. Canadian dollar steady. Saudi Arabia and Russia "secret" agreement to raise production tells in the markets this week. #nlgasprices
788 2018-10-16 22:37:21 Who uses cbd oil? Best brands? Cheapest brands? Tips? **not looking to smoke just use the oil**
789 2018-10-16 22:37:14 Nerve agent attack, now a murder inside a consulate? Countries are now figuring out they can get away with anything.... as long as it is small enough. “What are you going to do? Over one guy? Nothing! Because you still need our oil!” - Saudi Arabia
790 2018-10-16 22:37:00 .@senatorbrowne: Rolling back protections from oil & gas pollution with this lobbyist-fueled bill in the final days of the legislative session is an affront to PA families and a giveaway to industry special interests. #HB2154
791 2018-10-16 22:36:56 Looks delicious! I'm making angel hair with clams and olive oil for dinner.
792 2018-10-16 22:36:46 That’s exactly what kenney wants to deregulate everything in the path of oil companies and drillers
793 2018-10-16 22:36:32 Need to buy some more baby oil
794 2018-10-16 22:36:22 yeah? wasn’t for me.
795 2018-10-16 22:36:20 Oil is on the way out. Renewable power is on the up.
796 2018-10-16 22:36:18 Heheehee the crude oil that will come out of that Body
797 2018-10-16 22:36:12 Coming home to just free your head from your wig to oil your scalp  best feeling ever!
798 2018-10-16 22:35:53 It's pretty hard to take this article seriously when you defend the oil industry and claim they never tried to cover up anthropogenic climate change. Like, really?
799 2018-10-16 22:35:52 US Foreign policy always has been, and always will be.
Oil is thicker than blood.
800 2018-10-16 22:35:49 Sometimes I wonder if everyone gets what is deserves. The Saudis are worse than brutal animals and yet god has blessed them with abundance of oil and wealth to abuse while some of the most nicest people don’t have anything. #khashoogi
801 2018-10-16 22:35:48 W.Bush & Drumpf both love Saudi Arabi & Russia from big oil money that got them elected with hacking voting fraud and bribed money deals!! Vote them all out of our public lawmaking service!!
802 2018-10-16 22:35:47 Well, at least he will smell good enough to eat when he is realeased after anointing himself with all that olive oil.
803 2018-10-16 22:35:39 Which civil right movement? They don die the bubu rob their mouth with groundnut oil from daura
804 2018-10-16 22:35:35 how did oil prices respond?
805 2018-10-16 22:35:33 More evidence that the US is pretty much owned by Saudi Arabia through oil imports and debt. SA can bomb children, torture and kill opposition, without consequence.

I just been using baby oil
808 2018-10-16 22:34:34 Especially in our own party...corrupt politicians like John Bell Edwards of the Democratic Party are scum. He is in the pockets of the oil corps. He has passed harsh punishments against water protectors & allows mercenaries to violently oppress protesters in Louisiana.

809 2018-10-16 22:34:24 @garthbrooks you told a story about Grace and Mercy on #thegarthchanel #siriusxm a few months ago. It inspired us to name our 2 newest semi trucks Grace and Mercy. Can I get a print copy of the story to hang in the office at Farmers Oil in Anthony?
810 2018-10-16 22:34:01 Gabriela, that's not to say Iran's oil industry isn't being negatively impacted by sanctions—it most certainly is. However, the point of debate is in how much.

Iran countermeasures such as some ID'd by TankerTrackers were expected, repeated from previous experience.
811 2018-10-16 22:34:00 

the video *only* said "brightens skin."

we were talking about absorbing oil, etc, (which is what the video says it does and that's why it says it's not good to ingest!) and boy lost his damn mind.

813 2018-10-16 22:33:39 We need to build a wall, let's get mad about that Senator. We have been playing the game with
Saudi Arabia forever, not going to stop any time soon. I believe it has something to do with OIL could be wrong.
814 2018-10-16 22:33:07 Old carby V6, runs smooooth. Just did an oil change today. Purrrs :)
815 2018-10-16 22:33:03 (but they use palm oil! it's bad for orangutans!)
816 2018-10-16 22:33:01 But for the oil, we should have blown Saudi Arabia up after 9/11.
817 2018-10-16 22:32:58 Trudeau would rather keep buying Saudi oil and funnel money to terrorist organizations through international charities. It's his way of saying he loves Canada.
818 2018-10-16 22:32:53 Someone go to the oil show party w me
819 2018-10-16 22:32:52 The scientists say: Stop exploiting oil reserves.
The politicians say: We'll develop tar sands.

Intelligent people think: How can i prepare for the climate disaster that is inevitable with those idiots in charge?
820 2018-10-16 22:32:50 But prices are up on everything including groceries gas oil meds interest rates losing retirement $...you know all the things hard working Americans need every day some of us work 2 jobs
821 2018-10-16 22:32:42 Let's see them eat that oil!
822 2018-10-16 22:32:37 Kurt Vonnegut is a snake oil salesman. His writing is so pretentious, self-referential, and nihilistic that you can't help but despise Vonne
823 2018-10-16 22:32:32 Cannabis oil doesnt get you high lol
824 2018-10-16 22:32:28 me: let's stop oil companies from polluting the earth

pinker: no no, that's too practical, let's rely on innovations that have yet to be made and are only going to be efficient long after the effects of climate change
825 2018-10-16 22:32:22 My true goal is to one day make real puertorican rice, which, despite all my efforts i've never been able to properly reproduce. I need to find the right type, oil, and method. Nothing beats the savory sticky puertorican rice.
826 2018-10-16 22:32:16 Between the Kansas gluten and the automobile oil you're all DNA-ed, lubricated, and good to go! #healthyAsAnOx
827 2018-10-16 22:31:52 Combine this with queering the Quran and see how fast this just goes away.
828 2018-10-16 22:31:33 Ever since I shaved the back of my head, my scalp has been itchyyyyyyyyyyyy, time to oil it every night 
829 2018-10-16 22:31:31 While changing my oil, @AnciraNissanSAT also put air in my tires and put the license plate holder on the front of my car (and put the license plates on for me!) Thanks for the great service from a great @UIWAthletics sponsor!

831 2018-10-16 22:31:16 I first tried your cbd oil, then cbg oil (my favorite), and the cbd vape oil! Definitely don’t ever wanna go without it!
832 2018-10-16 22:31:06 it can, but it results in a different texture. (less moisture means it tends to get more crunchy bits. this may or may not be a good thing)

but e.g. my chocolate cake contains no butter, only vegetable oil
833 2018-10-16 22:31:05 Do you think refiners won't buy saudi oil for moral values? Aunque deberían hacerlo. Venezuela is still selling oil to the US
834 2018-10-16 22:30:42 Well he does have oil wells in Saudi Arabia, that's why they were left off travel ban list.
835 2018-10-16 22:30:31 There's the Snake Oil Salesman smile.  I warned him that if he didn't get his shit straight, I'd run against him myself in 2024 (assuming he runs again).

837 2018-10-16 22:30:20 Loved that oil. Good for cooking fried veggies & pork, Used to get jerrycans of it from Lira cotton ginery. Does that facility still exist?
838 2018-10-16 22:30:19 @ElectraPlayboy always brings the     . Not enough baby oil to douse her        and sexiness
839 2018-10-16 22:30:18 PSA organic extra virgin olive oil is $2.99 at ALDI 
840 2018-10-16 22:30:10 I’m shook with how many males I know that can’t change oil or a tire ...
841 2018-10-16 22:30:08 Yeah use Phani3's method because i only went the route i did because coconut oil on my hair (mixed girl hair) made my hair stiff and unmanageable. So it also depends on your hair type.
842 2018-10-16 22:30:06 That’s not an achievement. Any fool with a bit more guts would have put their foot down for a better deal. I guess we will just continue selling cheap oil. #boyarewestupid
843 2018-10-16 22:30:01 You know the only reason US is so buddy-buddy w/Saudis is bcuz of oil. Why aren't we looking 2 go green and stop the independence like we can & save our Earth while at it? Oil is bug biz$$$
844 2018-10-16 22:29:55 @chipfranklin we really don't need Saudi Arabia, the US exports more oil than it imports.
845 2018-10-16 22:29:46 Coconut oil and a soft cradle cap brush!!! Gets rid of dry flaky skin so well!
846 2018-10-16 22:29:32 Burning the mid-afternoon oil.
847 2018-10-16 22:29:26 Finish off by rubbing coconut oil on it. Job done. #Pioppi
848 2018-10-16 22:29:14 LMFAO  !!! Oil Bitch
849 2018-10-16 22:29:05 If y’all haven’t listened to Olive Oil by @OswinBenjamin produced by @RodTheProducer, you are indeed missing out !
850 2018-10-16 22:28:53 Option 5.  Bill is a corrupt Trumpista, without a conscience or true moral compass, and so merrily gaslighting for oil industry back-handers
851 2018-10-16 22:28:33 In the last 18 years, Saudi Arabia has supplied 15 terrorists to attack us on 9/11, which led to wars that killed 4000 of our soldiers. Now they've killed one of our citizens and dismembered his body & we're cool with it because of money, oil, and weapons.
852 2018-10-16 22:28:28 The higher oil goes the more money I make. 
853 2018-10-16 22:28:23 I'm starting to become fricken great at stuff. I used to be so fricken sCARED of hot oil!!!!
854 2018-10-16 22:28:10 The gall to speak about our responsibility to Yemen as you continue to sanction weapons sales to S. Arabia is astounding. Either you lack the shame of a sea urchin or you think the rest of us are complete morons.
Can you name 1 value we share with SA, other than oil = guns
855 2018-10-16 22:28:10 ...as different as Black & Oil
856 2018-10-16 22:27:56 it might have an equal amount of oil instead, depending
857 2018-10-16 22:27:51 Wow seriously you two know exactly that if Trumps comes out harshly against the Saudis they will pull their oil and plunge the world into complete chaos. They hold the power.
858 2018-10-16 22:27:51 Aye you know me, burning the midnight oil 
859 2018-10-16 22:27:23 No! It was just out to get soft so i could rub it on potatoes and bake them

The cats, meanwhile, cleaned a cold pan completely from olive oil
860 2018-10-16 22:27:06 Cooking for the family : A thread!
Started getting everything ready and in walks grandma early (per her usual) so I hit her with the Elvis music and 50’s rock.  A glass of wine and conversation about crotchety old people and if she has prospected any future oil men for dating
861 2018-10-16 22:27:02 Sports bike ? I have a Triumph Daytona 675. If you are going sports bike and haven't had one before I would go with a 600 over a 1000. Also if you get a sports bike without the plastic fairings its wayyyy easier to do oil changes etc.
862 2018-10-16 22:27:00 Oh I’m sure they use marge or just oil in this country. When I still went there regularly, i noticed they would introduce a product then, little by little, like Jenga, would see how many ingredients they could remove or substitute. Of course, the price never changed.
863 2018-10-16 22:26:34 Lol try Clary sage oil... holy shit that stuff knocks me right out. Every time I wake up with no socks on and I'm like how and when did that happen lol
864 2018-10-16 22:26:23 Hello G.W.Bush and the nonexistent WMDs that were never found we got all for the oil fields then Obama gave it all back with weapons and money so wouldn’t that mean Obama technically created isis
865 2018-10-16 22:26:06 @DaddyBearForex exclusively talks about oil and generally provides good insights

I believe TA is common across all markets but more experienced traders might disagree. Fibonacci Levels and trendlines/channels works best for me while trading $CL_F
866 2018-10-16 22:25:54 Read “Don’t Think of an Elephant.” But GOP had Luntz on call, weaponizing words & meanings:  softening global warming to “climate change,” oil drilling is “energy exploration.” Estate tax is “Death Tax.” Using words that trigger emotions.  100’s of focus groups.
867 2018-10-16 22:25:39 Absolutely but there’s a cartel of oil and auto biggies who want to fail tesla. They will go out of business. @elonmusk m a fan of your tweets , rockets ans cars
868 2018-10-16 22:25:34 She’s horrible, a trumper and an oil & gas darling. Perfect for BLM today.
869 2018-10-16 22:25:34 How sensible.  What all countries should be doing.  Btw, we have a lot of gas, oil, water and electricity but we really don’t like Trump so would have to have a special tax.  All that BS affects our air quality
870 2018-10-16 22:25:27 Fuck Oil. Fuck The Saudis, and years of holding us hostage. I've had it. Get a President IN who will transform our Country into clean, safe #Hydrogen Fuel supplies. Your grandchildren will thank you.
871 2018-10-16 22:25:02 Expansion of the West Texas #oil pipeline is scheduled to begin Nov. 1. That's great news for local producers!
872 2018-10-16 22:24:51 And don't forget it is Canada, not KSA that is the largest source of imported oil into the USA, by a factor of three. Just 'cause I saw an article missing that key data point.
873 2018-10-16 22:24:50 @GOP will either retain the house, or @realDonaldTrump’s true lifetime of deceit will become public knowledge. 
If I were a 2 bit snake oil salesman who cheated and bullied my way to the White House I’d increase my spending too.
874 2018-10-16 22:24:41 I fucking love having a dishwasher.

Also, my foot is doing better - did I mention I twisted it at training? - but I did some physio and took at hot bath and put in comfrey oil and kept moving and it's much less sore.
875 2018-10-16 22:24:39 okay, the jamaican castor oil keeps his curls in tact? where do i get it?
876 2018-10-16 22:24:37 values for oil, very sad as this will go in the history books
877 2018-10-16 22:24:33 No palm oil. All homemade.
878 2018-10-16 22:24:33 Shareholders in oil companies certainly want Cruz.
879 2018-10-16 22:24:32 i always forget how expensive curly hair is until i run out of shampoo and conditioner, leave in conditioner, dry shampoo, and keratin oil, and break my comb all in the same week.
880 2018-10-16 22:24:29 What makes an oil essential?
881 2018-10-16 22:24:28 Might be worth noting he's a geologist, and the major career pipeline in geology has long been straight into the fossil fuel industry.  Like, literally the final exam of the last geology course I took at uni was "here's some sample information and a map, now where is the oil".
882 2018-10-16 22:24:28 .... While another told me " they don't care what I do, I can do whatever I want". 

All I wanted to know is if the oil they asked me to put was recommended or required for my vehicle. 
They were absolutely no help and had a terrible attitude. They just wanted my money ...
883 2018-10-16 22:23:55 No oil. They don’t deserve it.
884 2018-10-16 22:23:54 Palm oil sweets?
885 2018-10-16 22:23:53 Wow he must really want those oil deals badly. This is highly disturbing to hear a sitting President to say about a citizen from this country. Our lives are not important to @realDonaldTrump he favors SA over the US.
886 2018-10-16 22:23:52 If I were President Trump, I would never trust a country that beheads women & treats them like they’re less than dogs!! Kills homosexuals, beats people for not falling in line! US nothing in common w/Saudi Arabia! We need to cut them off entirely & never buy oil from them again!
887 2018-10-16 22:23:50 No oil for YOU!
888 2018-10-16 22:23:49 I'll be surprised if anything of any substance happens at all. The #Saudis have Trump over a barrel. Billions of US debt held, $110B arms deals in the works, a threat to up oil prices to $400 a gallon. All of that plus veiled threats in the past of increased terrorism?
889 2018-10-16 22:23:48 Michigan is great, always has been. Right back to when the native Americans lived here on sacred land. We do not need snake oil salesmen. Trump still rigging elections?
890 2018-10-16 22:23:47 it's funny cos I acc have 4 hr GIS lectures on just map software n it makes me fully wanna commit 

I feel like jobs in oil would probably need a chemistry degree too and that's just madness cba
891 2018-10-16 22:23:21 Proverbs 27:9 

Oil and perfume make the heart glad, and the sweetness of a friend comes from his #trustworthy #counsel.
892 2018-10-16 22:23:20 If you work in the oil and gas industry, stainless steel #nameplates are the perfect choice to withstand the harsh environment.
893 2018-10-16 22:23:18 Well they did tell you that climate change would start with flooding but all you compensating fucks drove 9 hours in your brand new truck to drill some oil didn't ya?
894 2018-10-16 22:23:15 @Storm2T Saudis are r Allies. Turkey & Saudi Arabia r Sovereign Nations, Different Cultures. NO intervention 
Saudis can buy weapons from Russia drive r oil prices up destroy r economic recovery. Saudis Allies against Iran, terrorists
895 2018-10-16 22:23:15 Never ceases to amaze me that there is always an underlying factor beyond the science. Consistently a fear of carbon taxes, government regulation, a transition away from the oil sands, or those 'lefties' taking over the world. It's never really about the scientific evidence.
896 2018-10-16 22:23:13 I need to stop lagging on my oil change 
897 2018-10-16 22:23:12 The states may, but the politicians know that they don't get paid more when the state brings in more tax dollars. Corrupt politicians will still want their legalized bribes from oil and gas companies and car dealerships.
898 2018-10-16 22:22:51 @ bretman castor oil and aloe vera
899 2018-10-16 22:22:47 Hmmmm i can translate... please provide oil
900 2018-10-16 22:22:46 I honestly am not Interested in sending my license plate information. I visited the St. Anne's location in Winnipeg and the service was appalling. 

I simply asked a question about my oil change and one agent told me " I can do whatever I want" ....
901 2018-10-16 22:22:45 I think it’s used for when your hair is oily but since you add oil to curly hair, it wouldn’t be useful
902 2018-10-16 22:22:35 はちこうさんおはありですー！
903 2018-10-16 22:22:23 Venezuela screwed up by betting on oil only, just exactly as Trump proposes. Nothing to do with socialism, everything to do with foolish bets on fossil fuels.
904 2018-10-16 22:22:05 USA doesn’t like when one puts its oil on jeopardy.
905 2018-10-16 22:22:00 Castor Oil is also available here!
906 2018-10-16 22:21:43 おはようございます(*^^*)
907 2018-10-16 22:21:41 Didn’t take me driving 5 mins on hwy 80 to remember the oil shows in town
908 2018-10-16 22:21:38 Tell you that they love you that they loyal, they can keep that. They don’t want the soil just the oil that’s beneath that.
909 2018-10-16 22:21:29 Oil cartridges
910 2018-10-16 22:21:28 Two motor bikes slipped on Anzac Bridge just in front of me (one slipped avoiding the other). I stopped to check they were OK. We decided there must be oil. Later realised THAT'S JUST HOW SLIPPY IT IS. Be careful bikers! It's an ice rink out there.
911 2018-10-16 22:21:23 Don't you like coconut oil?
912 2018-10-16 22:21:17 fyi, the govt makes more of a gallon of gas than the oil companies via taxes. Maybe we should combat govt greed instead?
913 2018-10-16 22:21:14 オリーブ油で毎日を楽しく(*^_^*)
914 2018-10-16 22:21:10 Every word is true BUT money talks, AND they have oil.
915 2018-10-16 22:21:02 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed #TexasDebate
916 2018-10-16 22:21:00 Oga, goan buy power oil and masturbate. Konji loun fe mu eh misbehave...

It's overdue.
930 2018-10-16 22:19:44 @generalelectric Oil based light bulbs that use a single spark for ignition over continuous current. Might include production of filters for exhaust, and miniscule heat sinks for practical use. 

Could use the appeal of natural light over electric for that demographic appeal.
931 2018-10-16 22:19:41 again, if I may...and here in Canada the @CPC_HQ under @AndrewScheer want to do the same thing, tie our economy heavily to oil.
932 2018-10-16 22:19:13 Lmao your head too get oil @ChrisBerryLoui1 
933 2018-10-16 22:19:11 wtf is wrong with u people? Francis is a liar... Hit n run... Socialist... Wants open borders... Wants to cap the Oil & Gas industry which makes Texas such a good place for job opportunity! I mean seriously WTF is wrong with you people?

936 2018-10-16 22:18:48 The Turkish govt. had monitoring devices hidden inside the consulate. This isn't going to end pretty unless you make your living from oil. In that case you are going to do very well.
937 2018-10-16 22:18:47 Where it’s always been: pointing towards those sitting on the biggest oil reserves...
938 2018-10-16 22:18:41 Thank fuck for tomorrow because my TN is really acting up and I got paid and could def use some nice cbd oil relief
939 2018-10-16 22:18:15 Well she hired attorney Snake  Oil... where’s the integrity right there....Mr Dill Dough Esq.
940 2018-10-16 22:17:45 I recognize the necessity of talking oil and support the pipeline (mostly), Im just frustrated with hearing about it again and again, especially when there are other important subjects. Its necessary, doesnt mean I cant be annoyed bout it.
941 2018-10-16 22:17:43 We have been sweeping Saudi Arabia under the rug for decades...
since 9/11.  Now the lump in the rug is beginning to look like
Mount Everest.   They have murdered thousands.
Will their slimy oil save them again?
942 2018-10-16 22:17:41 No disrespect, but, WHAT,s goeing on??  Turkey, suddenly best friends vith reporters,??? Mr Trump wants answers about missing reporter??? Did the world turn upside down ???    ,,I smell a rat,,  global rat,, oil prises?? well,,

944 2018-10-16 22:17:38 Graham really wants to spike the price at the pump. Hasn't the GOP and Trump skyrocketed the cost of living to much already? Let secure oil from Iran and Venezuela as they are no worse than the Saud's amd we need lower prices at the pump!
945 2018-10-16 22:17:31 think services imports are overstated by 0.5 to 1 pp of GDP, so don't think there is (yet) a current account deficit -- high oil tho will make a difference, and China is closer to balance than in the past.
946 2018-10-16 22:17:30 I remember when I was in secondary school,there was a time when we came back from night prep and I was feeling hungry like hell and I  only have  cooked spaghetti with no oil or Maggi and I ate it with sugar and water... #WorldFoodDay #hungry #eat
947 2018-10-16 22:17:23 Money from arms sales & oil has bought the very souls of those who would have us believe they are humanitarians.

949 2018-10-16 22:17:06 when you take all factors that go into building the cars both EV and ICE and the fuel required, even accounting for mining the lithium as opposed to drilling for oil, EV tech is still FAR cleaner. and the batteries are completely recyclable.
950 2018-10-16 22:17:04 The press really needs to bring this reality show charade at the highest office of the land to end. Pool all your resources to drill into the head of Americans where @potus truly belongs- selling snake oil or behind bars. #vote #Election2018 #Resist
951 2018-10-16 22:17:02 Foods containing trans fats are primarily in processed foods made with trans fat from partially hydrogenated oil. #BadCholesterol #LDL
952 2018-10-16 22:16:55 Not ONE big oil co has done anything to improve the safety of their pipelines since at least Exxon Valdez. It's time they started making pipelines much SAFER before they try to take them over. They have no business forcing these pipelines on us for their own gain.
953 2018-10-16 22:16:55 Was it under Howard’s watch there was bugging of East Timor to gain an advantage in oil rights negotiations with, at that time, the poorest nation in the world? ‘Strength?’ Looks more like bullying.
954 2018-10-16 22:16:53 パンさんおはようございますー！
955 2018-10-16 22:16:47 Wow oil was my first loss in a week and half #scam
956 2018-10-16 22:16:45 Kinda wanna start investing my money and teach myself how to do an oil change. 
Kinda wanna dye my hair blonde like G Easy and buy a $90 sexy pizza rat costume.
957 2018-10-16 22:16:28 Oh thank you sir, thank you.  Trump sends his thanks and praises.  Send money.  We don’t mind if you murder American persons.  All is well.  Oil.  
958 2018-10-16 22:16:27 A rogue producer at Fox News needs to get their hands on the audio & put it on in the background the next time Trump has one of his friendly little chats with Fox & Friends. They need to hear it. They’re plugging their ears because oil & arms deals.
959 2018-10-16 22:16:13 Idk how many times I have to say how amazing castor oil is but YALL. I use it on my eyelashes and eyebrows every single night! That’s literally the only reason my eyelashes are so long and so curled naturally.
960 2018-10-16 22:16:09 Big Oil litterally invented our need for petroleum the same way Big Gay invented bisexuality
961 2018-10-16 22:16:06 I recently got some of the oil, it works pretty good,tastes like shit imo,but it definitely helps with like body pains. I have a fucced up shoulder and that shit made it feel nice and melty.
962 2018-10-16 22:16:05 Go to merchants it’s like $25 for an oil change and tire rotation
963 2018-10-16 22:15:57 
964 2018-10-16 22:15:54 Nice call and trading record - really impressive. Any tips on reading materials / people to follow for learning to trade oil? Or mainly just TA?
965 2018-10-16 22:15:45 Maybe it would help if you had a producing oil well in your back yard ... started wearing a white tablecloth ...
966 2018-10-16 22:15:35 Castor oil LITERALLY saved me.
967 2018-10-16 22:15:19 Italy got me eating bread and oil before every meal lol I’m packing on the pounds
968 2018-10-16 22:15:18 the way things are looking I just wanna go work in the oil field fuck this 
969 2018-10-16 22:15:15 Death by oil for us all.
970 2018-10-16 22:15:08 And we need their oil....oh, he didn’t say that...he may as well have...#donniejohnisacrook
971 2018-10-16 22:14:50 เราไม่ใช่สายซีรี่ย์เลยค่ะ แต่นี่เริ่มคิดละว่าหรือเรื่องนี้ควรไปดูก่อน5555
972 2018-10-16 22:14:48 Are you saying that oil prices are worth more than the life of an innocent man? I get confused reading these tweets
973 2018-10-16 22:14:45 Currently obsessed with baby oil baths.
974 2018-10-16 22:14:36 Eu acredito e espero um ótimo balanço. São 3 meses jul-set de oil e dólar alto.
975 2018-10-16 22:14:33 Oh they’ll be flat out buyin’ the h’oil now the week.
976 2018-10-16 22:14:28 What’s sadder is that there are so many ‘Mericans that buy into his shit. I need to start selling snake oil. Or a cure all liniment. Idiots.

978 2018-10-16 22:14:04 She pushed it.

Then when confronted about it on RNZ, she crawled out of that accusation.

Bennett is as deep as an oil slick on a puddle.
979 2018-10-16 22:14:04 Progressives who think they should be able to make decisions on behalf of sick people. Have seen them say: "Oh, great. Now snake oil salesmen will take advantage of people!"
980 2018-10-16 22:14:02 Because even the most basic economics class teaches you that world trade always outputs better world welfare.. How do you think the US became the leading economy and why do you think it imports oil from Saudi even though it can produce its own, moron.
981 2018-10-16 22:13:50 With mounting International pressure in regards to the missing reporter Jamal Khashoggi. the Saudi Government threatened to retaliate for sanctions that President Trump said they deserve. This has caused the world's top oil exporter's stock exchange to drop almost 7%.
982 2018-10-16 22:13:39 Let them crawl in their own sand. Let us pay just a fraction more for the oil. 

It will be cheaper in the end because we don't need to send in the military for decades
983 2018-10-16 22:13:35 Meritocracy is responsible for assuring the best of the best rise to the top and the benefits of resulting innovation and ideas are introduced into the public sphere through a competative process that weeds out the less efficient/effective.
984 2018-10-16 22:13:26 @SteveSchmidtSES Except for the slight issue of forcing #SaudiArabia abrogate its 1974 deal to price oil in USD might  change the worlds reserve currency to RMB or EUR, drive US rates to the stratosphere, and collapse the global economy.  Otherwise, it's fine...
985 2018-10-16 22:13:24 It's right there in the link: wheel alignment, basic inspection, replace the wiper blades, etc. As stated, "no traditional oil changes, fuel filter, spark plug replacements, or emission checks", not "never needs maintenance ever".
986 2018-10-16 22:13:17 United States Must stop spreading its stupid democracy. Human Rights abuses. Supporting a clear murder inside a consulate by Saudis King . claim of body pieces leaving consulate. To satisfy @realDonaldTrump investment in Saudi Arabia and American thirst for cheated oil.disgust

988 2018-10-16 22:13:11 True. But they have military significance, oil, money.... do we just send them to Russia or China??
989 2018-10-16 22:13:08 2014 Mercedes Benz C300 4Matic. Customer ignored an oil leak. $15 seal caused a great expense!! New front differential from Mercedes, $3400. Add labor. It’s expensive. If your car has a leak, have it inspected before it’s too late!

991 2018-10-16 22:12:56 Big oil that afraid of Tesla? I’ve had my M3 for a month and it’s incredible.
992 2018-10-16 22:12:40 Saudi Arabia represents all that is wrong with the world: a monarchy, stacked atop violently monotheistic religious zealots, stacked on a base of patriarchy. If they didn't have oil, they'd be irrelevant in the world. Make Saudi Arabia Irrelevant - wind, solar, hydro & hemp oil.
993 2018-10-16 22:12:39 Bri just called Camila, canola like the oil
994 2018-10-16 22:12:36 Dr. Christine Blasey Ford can't raise oil prices (Saudi threat to Trump).

She can't be coaxed into officially ending the Korean war.

She can't send any nuclear missiles our way.

Competing narratives hold Trump is soft on dictators — but will launch WWIII with one he admires

996 2018-10-16 22:12:28 Yes. They have. And as long as we get oil and money we just don’t give a shit apparently.
997 2018-10-16 22:12:28 All those oil rich middle east autocracies are dubious to say the least.
998 2018-10-16 22:12:23 Regarding the Kashoghi crisis in Saudi Arabia. I’m confused. Have I been misunderstanding news reports that the U. S. is now and has been oil independent?  So why now with the Saudi threat to raise oil prices so high that a gallon of gas in the U. S. would rise to $7 per gallon.
999 2018-10-16 22:12:11 Snake oil salesmen never tell you how their product is made or what it's really made with ;)
1000 2018-10-16 22:12:07 The Khashoggi event is designed to raise oil prices to destroy Europe.
1001 2018-10-16 22:12:07 Saudi Arabia is fucking INSANE between violating international law and commit war crimes left right and centre but so glad to see our beacon of democracy and equality the US prioritize oil and profits they make from selling weapons over basic human rights!!!!!
1002 2018-10-16 22:12:06 2 doctors with Bone saw!
Very obvious 
But Trump buys Becouse he will get cheap oil
1003 2018-10-16 22:12:06 my skin and hairs acting weird since it’s cold. need to drench myself in oil basically.
1004 2018-10-16 22:12:04 It doesn't surprised me how much the oil and gas companies are willing to spend on this.  I already voted yes on G.
1005 2018-10-16 22:12:01 My religion is tea tree oil
1006 2018-10-16 22:11:54 Surely this is on the whole world not just UK anyone who drives a car, flys a plane, uses any form.of.combustion engine who wants to maintain global oil price stability, that's who is to blame, it's too easy to blame just the Tories

1008 2018-10-16 22:11:38 They don’t want the soil just oil that’s beneath that 
1009 2018-10-16 22:11:29 People are calling for us to cut ties with Saudi Arabia...

Y'all gonna regret that shit when they cut off our oil supply and gas jumps to over $7 a gallon.
1010 2018-10-16 22:11:19 oil pan, youre done. oh im about to take a sloppy sloppy oil shower
1011 2018-10-16 22:11:10 Funny that you single out Venezuela! When are you asking the torries to stop oil imports from Saudi (far worse things happening there)

1013 2018-10-16 22:11:06 Here is my prediction- if he sanctions them and oil goes to $200 barrel and they then turn to China or Russia to purchase their arms, and we lose a strategic partner in Middle East- same people pounding him@now-will blame him for the results of sanctions on Saudi.
1014 2018-10-16 22:10:58 Well if the butter didn't work I brought vegetable oil lmao
1015 2018-10-16 22:10:57 The Saudis have millions of dollars. Spends a lot of it in the U.S. sells oil to to help investors make tons of money. So the gov. overlooks the attack on our country and the bringing down of 2 buildings and the murder of over 3000 citizens.
1016 2018-10-16 22:10:56 Oh! Invent the fumehood! Do studies on tobacco, radiation, carbon tetrachloride, and benzene effects on health decades early! Introduce studies on global warming from fossil fuels before there is a major oil industry to oppose it!

1023 2018-10-16 22:10:31 This is not even close to anything human, America should never consider Saudi Arabians anything but BARBARIANS!! Anyone thinking we need their oil and must put up with this is a LIAR! Even Saudi Arabia knows they aren't gonna run out of oil they are going to run out of customers.
1024 2018-10-16 22:10:30 Was there ever a serious question that this partisan hack is not a serious and qualified Secretary of State? He was brought over during musical chairs when the Russian-loved oil executive Trump had doing this before got too tired of his stupidity.

North America will be energy independent soon.
Middle East oil is not a pressing concern to the U.S.
1034 2018-10-16 22:10:00 because oil money can buy politicians

1039 2018-10-16 22:09:45 You know, if you hadn’t played the first MGS & selected that as an option in the opening menu, it just goes straight to Raiden on the oil rig.
1040 2018-10-16 22:09:42 I’m not % but couldn’t we just stop shipping our oil overseas, keep it for ourselves, refine it ourselves, creating more jobs, and be fine? We don’t NEED to care what Saudi Arabia or OPEC do. @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse #MAGA @DonaldJTrumpJr #Qanon
1041 2018-10-16 22:09:19 Too bad Cuba doesn’t have oil.

1045 2018-10-16 22:09:00 @FoxNews @BretBaier Answer me this, if we now out produce the world in oil why would gas go to seven dollars a gallon if Saudi Arabia turns off the spicket or raises the price why don’t we just redirect our oil here for a normal price? Or is it just me?
1046 2018-10-16 22:08:59 Quality Australian produce is delayed into China by Chinese custom, causing considerable damage. They prefer sewage oil, toxic baby formula, fake vaccine and poisonous food. They even want to eat grass for one year against USA. Good luck for the Chinese.

1055 2018-10-16 22:08:20 Transition away to what? Speculative future technology won't cook my dinner tonight nor heat my home this winter. Lacking reliable gas supplies will push people to oil, which is much worse.

1057 2018-10-16 22:08:01 Social security is paid for by its own tax, it doesn’t add to the deficit.

1064 2018-10-16 22:07:09 Heads up Bremerton: @PSNSandIMF will conduct an oil spill training exercise on Wednesday. Response gear (oil-absorbing pads, skimming boats) will be deployed near the west end of the shipyard and across Sinclair Inlet to Port Orchard. The exercise shouldn't impact ferries.
1065 2018-10-16 22:07:07 You might ask why is President Trump being so delicate with Saudi Arabia? It's simple it's the situation Obama and the liberal Democrats put us in we are so dependent on Saudi oil that if they cut off the spicket our gas prices at the pump will instantly go to $7 a gallon wake up
1066 2018-10-16 22:07:06 There is no time left to wait for government to lead. We must do it ourselves. Simply follow 3 instructions 1. use only renewable fuels (ie not gas, oil, turf or coal) for heat light power and transport, 2. eat no meat or fish and 3. plant trees. So achieving #UN #SDG13
1067 2018-10-16 22:07:03 I would have thought tough guy Trump would be talking regime change in Saudi Arabia and taking their oil. 
1068 2018-10-16 22:07:03 That's a bet! I'm gonna make this oil and test it out!
1069 2018-10-16 22:07:02 Owowow- some oil splashed onto my hand q x q
1070 2018-10-16 22:06:52 Gee, ya think?  Maybe you could do something about that now that it appears the US is condoning murder and torture for oil and profit.  GOP and Trump are destroying this country hourly.  All for greed and power.
1071 2018-10-16 22:06:49 Everytime I see a guy talking about how us women just get in our cars and drive without checking the oil ever or warning it in winter I be on the floor!

1078 2018-10-16 22:06:13 Steph, it's like this: some of McConnell's largest donors have taken a hard look at the future of marijuana production and decided that Kentucky and adjacent states might be able to dominate markets. They arranged a secret demonstration for Mitch, and the oil's THC was too high.

1081 2018-10-16 22:05:59 The government is trying to make gas $7.00 a gallon. Cause, Saudi Arabia. The whole diplomat murder is covered so heavy to make people believe this. Didn’t Trumpdog say we were the world leaders in oil production? The government can make oil for less than $.30.

1089 2018-10-16 22:05:21 Be aware that many "conservatives" are excusing this guy. It's further evidence that the GOP sees nature as a warehouse/funhouse for endless takings. Same deal with denial of AGW and oil scarcity. Everything about them is wrapped in ego & money. #TrophyHunting

1092 2018-10-16 22:05:02 It wasn’t a hot economy, perhaps only service sector jobs were hot.; ie Walmart jobs, not manufacturing, shale/oil jobs, healthcare and related professions, which have increased employment exponentially.
1093 2018-10-16 22:04:52 So I just put a little squirt of olive oil. But I think any oil is fine. And mason when I'm prepping the water I add the oil and sometimes I add oil to the sauce. Maybe it's just the Indian way or something

1103 2018-10-16 22:04:08 What a catastropic decision...millions of innocent lives lost or ruined...trillions spent on a war for oil...unending acts of terrorism by justifyingly angry muslims...
1104 2018-10-16 22:04:08 It's another stupidity from Peter Amewu to probe the purchase of helicopter to protect our oil and gas

1105 2018-10-16 22:04:06 US world oil price (out of Cushing, Oklahoma), $71.92 per barrel...Western Canadian Select (out of Edmonton), $25.67.  A sad, sad story. How did we do this to ourselves. We need a hero to fix this. Desperately.
1106 2018-10-16 22:03:54 When we submit ourselves to God..
The Oil will be poured..and we will have great favor with God and man
1107 2018-10-16 22:03:52 Benue state must look beyond any governor that will depend on oil rise, anyone can do the job if it is just to send your commissioner of finance to FCT every month in hunt for allocation,  then pay salary 
Anyone can do just that 
@benuestategovt @Benue @benue_state
1108 2018-10-16 22:03:34 Just got off the phone with a friend who got laid off and is an oil patch orphan now. It blows my mind that our own govt can’t see (or won’t see) how much the foreign funded protesting is DESTROYING FAMILIES!!! Time to sue the US for meddling. They’d do it to us in a heartbeat!
1109 2018-10-16 22:03:34 Curry is the best food, but it's even better with chili oil.
1110 2018-10-16 22:03:22 I feel like all companies do this. However, I did buy Saturn based on positive reviews and it made my acne so much worse. But I swear by the UFO oil to keep hormonal acne under control. It is the best!
1111 2018-10-16 22:03:21 Been putting coconut oil on Charlie and his fur looks so good I could cry ;_;
1112 2018-10-16 22:03:11 Only in swimming pool water is clear. In Pacific ocean water is dirty from oil and others rubbish
1113 2018-10-16 22:03:07 How? for the open borders for illegals OR for wanting a $10. TAX on every barrel of Texas oil. Not sure how either one is fighting FOR Texas.  #KeepTexasRed
1114 2018-10-16 22:03:06 People are dying in Hospitals....At UBH no cooking oil no salt no sugar for admitted patients...is it what u promised on your billboards
1115 2018-10-16 22:03:04 As an ignorant american, can you enlighten me as to why fish and chips are wrapped in newspaper? 
Is it to soak up oil?
1116 2018-10-16 22:02:57 Hi, I saw a commercial for back/knee braces that people with Medicare may qualify for little or no cost. 

If good for them, do you know if healing CBD oil qualify for Medicare? If not, it should be!
1117 2018-10-16 22:02:52 @realDonaldTrump you can’t be kind of isolationist. Like being kind of vegan. If we need oil we have our own. Do something right with Saudi Arabia.
1118 2018-10-16 22:02:52 Turkey and Iran’s regional ambitions and religious divide put them in conflict. And Turkey doesn’t have oil and needs it. We should exploit that
1119 2018-10-16 22:02:52 Wait did I really just pour that much sesame seed oil in there?

Yes, yes I did.  Oh dear.
1120 2018-10-16 22:02:40 Oh, and how about that pesky #climatechange problem the UN said we need to solve in 10 years by not burning their oil !or ours). How many billions of dollars do US taxpayers spend protecting their oil exports to us free of charge?
1121 2018-10-16 22:02:20 Oh hellz to the yes. I am not really hating on Notley and I'm glad that this is helping her, but it's just starting to sound like a broken record. It's like, "you know theres more to this province than oil, right?"
1122 2018-10-16 22:02:18 If I had the drive to learn or the ability o paint beautiful wall-length oil paintings of "The Scream" smiling and enjoying a stroll in the park with his many sons I absolutely wouldn't be on this hell site
1123 2018-10-16 22:02:00 The carnival barker himself, the Creepy Porn Lawyer, snake oil salesman. What a joke he is.
1124 2018-10-16 22:01:57 u need a leader with all oil of Lord's spirit a glowin in he-a radient one that has oil makin his inner fire a going higher only-getting more enthused towards Lord and his kingdom that don't ever have an end-
1125 2018-10-16 22:01:56 needed to get my oil changed and my car inspected today, so me being the responsible adult that i am, got my nails done and went out to eat instead 
1126 2018-10-16 22:01:53 พอดีใมีคนแนะนำนิยายเรามา ตอนแรกจะไปซื้อ แต่เจอคนรีวิวเหมือนซีรีย์จบแบบ แยกกัน เราเลยลังเล ขอยคุณมากๆนะคะ
1127 2018-10-16 22:01:42 I cook it with oil in the pan, does that count?

1129 2018-10-16 22:01:35 I am most sad for the people who believe your exegetical shenanigans and all those who will pay for it later. You’re a snake oil salesman, not a representative of strong Nebraska values. Can’t wait til you’re just another heartless lobbyist in a sea of suits. Out of office.
1130 2018-10-16 22:01:10 THIS is the nightmare everyone hoped would not happen. A President with so many business ties, globally, the strings could never be cut, if need be. If Trump had any balls, he would screw big Oil, and go Hydrogen. End the addiction, save the environment. Guess that's too easy.
1131 2018-10-16 22:01:03 A complete repudiation of everything they stood for on immigration from Bill Clinton and prior to Obama.  So what changed?
1132 2018-10-16 22:00:59 Yeah but the orange man in white house says jobs and oil prices, so...
1133 2018-10-16 22:00:57 Nothing is working....not sex, not walking, not castor oil
1134 2018-10-16 22:00:49 I believe the Prince's explanation that the journalist, rubbing his hands, vanished into an oil lamp.
1135 2018-10-16 22:00:43 Here's what I know. Wecan be truly self sufficient. Have our own manufacturing... produce more than enough food, have all the oil we can use. What do you suppose will happen to Europe if the US stopped buying oil from the middle east? Good thing you folks have open borders. ;)
1136 2018-10-16 22:00:42 มันจบแฮปปี้แบบงงๆ บอกไม่ถูกอ่ะ แบบเอ๊ะจบแล้วหรอ ฮ่าๆ คนแต่งคนเดียวกันกะเฮโรอีนคะ แต่เรื่องนี้จะเป็นเรื่องแรกๆเลยของเจ้ไข่เขา

1140 2018-10-16 22:00:04 Reading about congealed balls of fat blocking sewers in London & Tokyo #japantimes got me thinking how it’s not very easy to get rid of used oil 

How do you get rid of waste oil?
1141 2018-10-16 22:00:00 .@senatorbrowne: At the 11th hour, @PASenateGOP leadership is pushing a bill rolling back safeguards from oil&gas pollution that protect PA families. Oil&gas industry is again promoting their toxic agenda for political gain. Vote NO on #HB2154.
1142 2018-10-16 21:59:55 Yes Boss!
1143 2018-10-16 21:59:54 Olbas oil works even better
1144 2018-10-16 21:59:48 Maybe but wire transfers originating from the US and going to Mexico just became their biggest source of income, surpassing oil revenues. Need E Verify across the board to curtail the unethical employers who hire illegals to pad their profits. DC wants illegals here though.

1149 2018-10-16 21:58:58 today i woke up in my mechanical state with a craving for oil to feed my robot joints but then i listened to I Am Not A Robot by Marina and the Diamonds and suddenly reverted back to my fleshy human self
1150 2018-10-16 21:58:52 what kind of oil change takes 2 fucking hours
1151 2018-10-16 21:58:45 Empty?
I think not..
Example, where did the oil come from to light up London, Birmingham, and lubricate the Industrial Revolution?
The Falklands & South Georgia mainly.
And licences were issued by the Brits to the Americans for this.
The first Oil Boom here in my country.
1152 2018-10-16 21:58:41 Bruh. Try with oil next time
1153 2018-10-16 21:58:29 Not worth it.
1154 2018-10-16 21:58:27 I was getting an oil change today and the worker came to ask me if I wanted anything to drink and I jumped so dramatically and made her feel bad. This is why people don’t talk to me.
1155 2018-10-16 21:58:13 Now with #SaudiArabia that would be 3 places, at least, that own @realDonaldTrump with #Russia & #NorthKorea also owning the snake oil salesman. Maybe this is his retirement plan or he thinks he is in another remake of the #Producers but he is selling shares in #USA ! #justsaying

1162 2018-10-16 21:57:42 You ever wonder why oil companies never invested in renewables? Why so much oil and coal lately?
Over 5000 free energy patents have been kept secret from the people. 
Free energy is already here and @GOP and there oil buddies are hurrying to stuff their pockets. 
Vote them out!
1163 2018-10-16 21:57:41 @traceminerals35 ya should sponser me..
Your CBD oil is amazing.
I keep telling others about it!!!!
Its super organic..they use trace minerals from seawater. WOW!
I FINALLY STOPPED LOOKIN...
You all should try it and buy from this company they also have it in capsules. 
Blessed
1164 2018-10-16 21:57:30 How do you use olive oil? Seems like most olive oil use is carb-related.  I love the taste, and occasionally just savor a spoonfull, but am at a loss to add it to a low carb diet meaningfully
1165 2018-10-16 21:57:26 I hope a shit load of peppermint tincture taken internally and peppermint essential oil massages above my sinuses can do the trick otherwise I’m not sleeping tonight because I literally can’t breath

1173 2018-10-16 21:56:43 But the Arab oil embargo of the early 70s and thevidea that are Shah supported us vs the Soviets made us overlook how truly awful he was. Now the Iranian govt is even worse. But the people there want freedom. They want change
1174 2018-10-16 21:56:42 Check out an app called Art Rage they’ve had that real oil painter look for iPad since day one.
1175 2018-10-16 21:56:35 At the current rate of oil consumption, we will run out of oil in about 39 years.
1176 2018-10-16 21:56:33 I’m bout to try witch hazel, tea tree oil, everything I haven’t tried because my skin just won’t get clear 
1177 2018-10-16 21:56:30 the US is trying to prevent Tesla’s and Elon Musk’s success so we can continue to rely on fossil fuels and oil from the Middle East so the government can make more money and war: a conspiracy.
1178 2018-10-16 21:56:20 Right. And that policy is very much in our interest, considering just how much the interests of the two of the world's biggest oil producers (Russia and Iran) are opposed to ours.
1179 2018-10-16 21:56:14 Well not oil, but it is acrylic. ;]
1180 2018-10-16 21:56:10  I’ve told it’s tea tree oil 
1181 2018-10-16 21:56:03 So overdue pregnant women aren't allowed to take orange juice and castor oil anymore as it is a child protection issue.
1182 2018-10-16 21:56:01 US invasion would honestly just result in the same shit, we'd just plunder the oil and resources better
1183 2018-10-16 21:55:56 I haven't really grown much given my age and remaining natural but a few tips include supporting natural T levels with zinc and fish oil. Sleep. Stress reduction. Water. Adequatr Protein and recovery. lift consistently, lift to failure, lift heavy on final sets (but safely).
1184 2018-10-16 21:55:55 Sebi they want to raise and make money via tax and levies , a country that doesn’t make anything even the oil go abroad lol
1185 2018-10-16 21:55:53 the spike in blood pressure i experience when people in food television season the shit out of something and then wash it all away with olive oil
1186 2018-10-16 21:55:46 If I was sleeping in a man's arms, e for don tire cos this skincare routine is not beans. Everywhere oil 
1187 2018-10-16 21:55:45 This distilled water and vitamin E oil has my skin POPPIN.
1188 2018-10-16 21:55:38 @jimmy_dore I was really hoping you'd press Kelton on MMT and its proponents inability to convincingly explain the dollar's privileged relationship to the global trade of oil. Is MMT one of the examples of the Left's magical thinking you and @ChrisLynnHedges touched upon?
1189 2018-10-16 21:55:26 No it ain’t, but without oil, how you going to drive your vehicle? Without mining how are going to be able to argue with me on Twitter, or call a family member, or watch @StormyDaniels porn?
1190 2018-10-16 21:55:23 With oil at an all time high
1191 2018-10-16 21:55:15 Nah, I think a better idea would be for another Arab spring to happen, the Arabian people bring democracy themselves into Saudi Arabia instead of having oil corporations """spread freedom and democracy""" and the Sauds getting their heads chopped off French Revolution style
1192 2018-10-16 21:54:58 あﾞ~~電車の中あったけえ、、
1193 2018-10-16 21:54:52 Coal and Oil states??? P.S make a E scooter finally. I send you design or use Honda Fjs 600
1194 2018-10-16 21:54:44 I use @mamamio tummy rub oil. So far so good but I’m only 22 weeks so who knows! x
1195 2018-10-16 21:54:42 It would JJ boobs and whatever Sophie Anderson us together and maybe some oil
1196 2018-10-16 21:54:31 Where does one even get orange oil?
1197 2018-10-16 21:54:30 Neutron bombs.  Leave the buildings, just replace the staff.
1198 2018-10-16 21:54:28 #Crude #oil $WTI bulls came back this Tuesday and broke above the 72.00 handle. The correction seems to be over and a breakout to 73.00 is likely on the cards for bulls.
1199 2018-10-16 21:54:24 Go sell your snake oil somewhere else. His denial doesn’t exonerate the Saudis. No one expects an admission from him.
1200 2018-10-16 21:54:24 How can we get more women to do hard labour jobs so they shift culturally to sanitation, mining, oil rigging, brick laying, plumbing, carpentry, construction, mechanics, farming and share more physical exertion?
1201 2018-10-16 21:54:14 People think "We'll go to alternative energy" but it isn't the cars to worry about. It's the fact our entire agricultural system is built on oil. Totally mechanized and reliant on Haber process synthetic fertilizer which also requires oil to make. That's what we learned in 1973.
1202 2018-10-16 21:54:12 Remember, fondly, the 'keep your hands off Scotland's oil' stickers. Flower of Scotland sung at the end of concerts, but not so much 10 o'clock closing and carry outs! Often visited Scotland when at university and my best friend based in Edinburgh. Youth!
1203 2018-10-16 21:54:03 I saw someone that’s licensed in skincare say coconut oil as a lube is a no no.umm my obgyn actually said it’s fine lol. My licensed doctor that also practices holistic care..so. Some folks just loathe coconut oil. For the face, sure it sucks, but as a lube it’s fine.
1204 2018-10-16 21:54:00 Feelings/Money = Water/Oil .... they don’t mix
1205 2018-10-16 21:53:56 Counterattack อ่าค่ะ
1206 2018-10-16 21:53:49 We keep the rest of the world from being held hostage for oil
1207 2018-10-16 21:53:45 Why the double standard? Why you support a LNG project and at the same time you oppose the pipeline expansion? Neither you and your greenpeace friends are being paid by the US to block this one? Oh, could it be that LNG is going to Asia and crude oil to the US???
1208 2018-10-16 21:53:30 Evil oil man estabeleceu o lugar de melhor live da vida!  Obrigado Deus
1209 2018-10-16 21:53:25 There is a simple reason why the West has been too leniant with Saudi, OIL. Those who remeber the 70's will be very familiar with the energy crisis and it's causes. If the oil was stopped again today, it would be catastrophic.
1210 2018-10-16 21:53:19 The #CherokeeNation has a say, but you don't. You poisoned The People's water, and left them vulnerable to oil spills. You have no say at all.
1211 2018-10-16 21:53:18 We don’t need Saudi Arabia we should invade them and take there oil at least we get some of our money back
1212 2018-10-16 21:53:00 She’s no oil painting you know 
1213 2018-10-16 21:52:55 Watching a Feminist documentary while researching all natural/kratom/CBD oil products to be a brand rep for. Just fuckin around 
1214 2018-10-16 21:52:52 How do you even wash a baby hair out hella oil in it and bring her outside in the cold

1216 2018-10-16 21:52:43 Hello I’d like everyone to know that @FirestoneTires charged me $75 for an oil change so nobody ever go there thanks
1217 2018-10-16 21:52:42 I sprinkled fair dust on mine and I think the little hole on the end of it turned into a smile!...oil is definitely the wrong colour though
1218 2018-10-16 21:52:40 Wow this was so helpful thank you so much! I bought an oil I’m going to try, hopefully it will make a difference! 
1219 2018-10-16 21:52:40 Sometimes the mere threat is all it takes – the Saud's took them serious enough to give away the keys to the Kingdom. In return, the Americans developed and built up their country, paid for with their own money (oil sales ---> reinvestment in USA)
1220 2018-10-16 21:52:40 yay! so happy  We hope to offer more variety in the next days and weeks. Roast them in the oven with a bit of oil and salt...Yummy 
1221 2018-10-16 21:52:29 @taylorswift13 They are 5tudying what we are eating. Hou5e 9105. Ki55. They aim to ki11 us using food. Mwah.™ I love you. Mwah. They are adding heavy and large amount5 of oil and fat to our groc3ry meat5 and food. I love you. Ki55. This aft3r 15 year5, is hara55ment.
1222 2018-10-16 21:52:28 It's called oil
1223 2018-10-16 21:52:25 Were it not for our (correct) role in defending Israel, there's no reason to be in the region, especially now that oil dependency is a near non-issue.

Protecting our only steadfast ally aside, there's no sound reason to be in the ME. They are all, every last country, shitholes.
1224 2018-10-16 21:52:13 Restocked on shea butter and body oil and couldn't be happier
1225 2018-10-16 21:52:08 Simply managed conflict and a matter of supporting the least of the worst at the moment and trying to keep it balanced and  contained from spilling out. "Worst actor," is largely a subjective assessment. Objectively not many are better or worse than another
1226 2018-10-16 21:52:02 Low density lipoprotein aka 'bad cholesterol' or LDL cholesterol can be found in palm oil, coconut oil, and cocoa butter. 
If these now qualify as meat or dairy I must have missed the memo  it has been a while since I study biology.
1227 2018-10-16 21:51:43 I don't know why it's so controversial to defund them. Not one federal or state dollar should go to any of these places.
1228 2018-10-16 21:51:40 Who do you think created the conditions for the mullahs to take over Iran? We are not talking centuries ago - it was your friend Churchill (hero to some, monster to many others) in 1953 who with CIA’s help removed the only democracy that Middle East had ever seen - all for oil.

1230 2018-10-16 21:51:23 Also all the money we sent there in exchange for their oil reserves was invested here so they own us?
1231 2018-10-16 21:50:58 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed #TexasDebate
1232 2018-10-16 21:50:58 Also since I see other people mentioning it: CBD OIL! Does it help your anxiety/depression? Cause I'm looking into it now and I think I'm gonna try getting some gummies.
1233 2018-10-16 21:50:57 At work selling my hair oil 
1234 2018-10-16 21:50:53 that's also okay because not everyone has the need for the excessive moisture body butter and oil will provide, it can be an irritant to many lol
1235 2018-10-16 21:50:51 But oil corporations’ profits.....
1236 2018-10-16 21:50:49 And the oil receipts had a higher purchasing power
1237 2018-10-16 21:50:39 Better stop that - burn down a forest, kill a few orangutans, plant a palm oil tree, then we can throw that nasty animal fat away.
1238 2018-10-16 21:50:37 I go in, buy beard oil, leave.
1239 2018-10-16 21:50:32 damn this all of oil is tangy
1240 2018-10-16 21:50:28 Powerful DC politicians have been licking boots and other Saudi extremities for decades. Second City was doing  comedy skits on our more popular DC suits gleefully brown nosing oil sheiks at least 20-25 years ago.
1241 2018-10-16 21:50:24 Oil reserves?
1242 2018-10-16 21:50:14 Them cannibals in 3rd world countries got the toughest seasoning game bruh..folk will cook YO ass with no oil.

1245 2018-10-16 21:49:57 And not for the people. Just oil and military defense companies.
1246 2018-10-16 21:49:54 Way too true
1247 2018-10-16 21:49:51 Not surprising to see that your skepticism isn't about the science but about a perceived underlying issue that you are ideologically opposed to. Be it carbon taxes, gov't regulation, or phasing out of the oil sands, there is always a fear of change that drives the skeptics agenda

1249 2018-10-16 21:49:43 Not even to condemn it publicly, is is it what is obtainable in other climes? Public officers are put under pressure by other public officers to answer for their deeds or resign.

1254 2018-10-16 21:49:17 Dude rose oil saved my skin
1255 2018-10-16 21:49:11 Stocks have bounced, supported by strong earnings results, while oil prices rose as evidence of higher US production was overshadowed by concerns about supply from Iran and Saudi Arabia. Ahead of the local open SPI futures are 32 points higher at 5,886. #ausshares #stockmarket
1256 2018-10-16 21:49:06 We have so many oil reserves in our country it's great that we can use our own renewable resources tat work just as well.
1257 2018-10-16 21:48:52 @broightergold chilli oil would be a great addition ;-)
1258 2018-10-16 21:48:43 They did it during the 1973 Arab Oil Embargo which shattered the US economy. I'd say we never recovered from that.
1259 2018-10-16 21:48:22 It also can cause miscarriage (using the oil or tea)

1264 2018-10-16 21:47:38 Oil prices will be under pressure, shale productions soar like nobody's business.. 

The problem when cowboys managing oil rigs.
1265 2018-10-16 21:47:22 This would be me bc coconut oil is the best moisturizer
1266 2018-10-16 21:47:19 This is the extent of the power crisis in Pakistan. Silent and poor citizens crushed. And electricity is perhaps more important than food. These furnace oil power plants and the new ones costing a ton are a disaster for the Pakistan economy. There is no alternative to cheap power
1267 2018-10-16 21:47:12 Fickle the journalist they counting their commission on $80bn  wort of arms sales Saudi can use to kill more innocent kids in yemen
1268 2018-10-16 21:46:59 Fighting terrorism and evolving our food system are not mutually exclusive projects.  But since animal ag. is so energy inefficient, abolishing it would reduce our reliance on foreign oil, some of which indirectly supports terrorism.
1269 2018-10-16 21:46:51 I’m all for renewables but one problem, you cannot sell it outside of your country.  The US is our only client and they buy it at 30% less than the going rate.  Alberta relies on its revenue.  We are the cleanest producer of oil and we reclaim all lands used in this.
1270 2018-10-16 21:46:45 It is weird that orange oil is flammable.
1271 2018-10-16 21:46:37 Worked changing oil for a while. Boss refused to properly dispose of the empty oil bottles, so I took it upon myself to do so on my own time. To mess with me my boss & some coworkers made a game of coming in after hours to throw the empties I was collecting into a dumpster.
1272 2018-10-16 21:46:30 Don't forget all the corrupt right-wing "think tanks" that regularly parrot oil industry propaganda.
1273 2018-10-16 21:46:27 axel's so nice..! i just hope he doesn't trip over all that oil..;;
1274 2018-10-16 21:46:26 Lucas, when changing your oil: I had to do it to em...

...no seriously this is my job
1275 2018-10-16 21:46:22 Saudi Arabia threatening to raise oil price, well that could benefit Nigeria.
1276 2018-10-16 21:46:16 I’m waiting to get my oil changed and listening to the most asinine Fox News debate on TV. I know the media is biased from every viewpoint, but when a group is having a debate, the blind hypocrisy is that much more apparent. #StoptheInsanity
1277 2018-10-16 21:46:16 Our friend at Pykes Pantry takes CBD oil for her migraines. She said she takes it daily as a preventative for it to work
1278 2018-10-16 21:46:12 China has stated they intend to loan money to Syria and rebuild the country. There are pipelines and oil at stake.
1279 2018-10-16 21:45:59 Because it’s a bargaining chip for something else. The information is worth potentiom billions. Nobody wants to work with a country that just kidnaps people and saws them up... that’s why his 2030 invest in Saudi before the oil runs out is losing patronage.
1280 2018-10-16 21:45:49 Stocks across the world have bounced back, supported by strong earnings results and expectations, while oil prices rose as evidence of higher US production was overshadowed by concerns about supply from Iran and Saudi Arabia.

1283 2018-10-16 21:45:39 Yes, but oil is not really going to be a resource for the future, Scotland never had it so nothing to miss. WM is going to struggle without it
1284 2018-10-16 21:45:32 Quinoa  Packed with #glutenfree protein, it’s easy to cook and delicious when you add a little olive oil, salt, pepper, and other favorite flavors.  (We enjoy mixing in black beans, tomatoes, chiles, cilantro, and #vegan cheddar cheese.) Yum!  #WorldFoodDay

Check into Frankincense oil. Just finished reading a great article on it . Be well Charles.
1291 2018-10-16 21:45:08 The sanctions are not aimed at the country.
These are aimed at specific government oficials listed by US congress due to drug trafficking and other interesting stuff.
In fact the US still buys oil from Venezuela, how would you explain sanctions if PDVSA is an US oil supplier?

1297 2018-10-16 21:44:48 Wouldn’t alleviate much traffic at all, crude oil accounts for a very small portion of traffic at either of Canada’s major railways despite beliefs otherwise.
1298 2018-10-16 21:44:47 The evil kingdom being fossil fuels, the wall being the oil companies ignorance to continue using those fossil fuels, and the victory being the result of transferring from fossil fuels to solar energy. I shouldn’t be arguing with trumptards but I literally said EXAMPLE.
1299 2018-10-16 21:44:47 Everyone knows we subsidize oil companies, but how many people are familiar with farm subsidies? They overwhelming support farmers whose carbon, methane, and nitrous oxide emissions far exceed any sustainable amount. Let’s draft a bill to change that. #WorldFoodDay

1302 2018-10-16 21:44:19 I used to DIY all this stuff, even did a few timing belts... but now my time is more valuable. I haven’t done an oil change in like 5 years lol
1303 2018-10-16 21:44:18 What if I cover it with oil, throw in a sprig of thyme and rosemary, and add some crushed, then put in the oven at 220. Then is it roasted cheese, or just me being pedantic as fuck?
1304 2018-10-16 21:44:10 Mike and his crew have always taken superb care of me and my vehicle...from the regular oil changes to the major repairs, I've never had better care. And they've always worked with me on the pricing to make it the best deal in town! I give them 5 stars every time!!
1305 2018-10-16 21:43:55 Please change your oil 10,000 Miles or less.  Your truck will thank you, your pocket will thank you, your future self will thank you.
1306 2018-10-16 21:43:55 Just what the Oil Execs want: for us to argue whether humans are causing it, rather than just living SUSTAINABLY, which is fuckin' inevitable because fossil fuels are limited. JUST FUNKING MOVE ON and progress ffs!
1307 2018-10-16 21:43:51 Time to throw oil upon Australia's troubled waters...Instead of bailing out the LNP...throw them out so they can get their act together from the rabble they now are...Australia needs a period of calm and order to spring-clean the house...Vote Labor.
1308 2018-10-16 21:43:38 An replaced w some oil merchants .. lose lose .. except Saudi’s won’t be scared to throw their money around
1309 2018-10-16 21:43:21 Yeah, Saudia Arabia has acess to tons of oil. That's why's he's so giddy with joy!
1310 2018-10-16 21:43:16 The bottom line here which is being eroded and ducked out from is no compatibility.  That's the truth. Another example;  oil and water.
1311 2018-10-16 21:43:10 War is to the 21st century what oil was to the 20th; the pillar that supports the global economy.
1312 2018-10-16 21:43:09 ponds has a lot of mineral oil. really broke me out  that stuff is only good for señoras post menopause
1313 2018-10-16 21:43:02 That's him @oil_castor  ...
1314 2018-10-16 21:42:41 I don’t support Saudi Arabia ever, but I think the recent pressures has one reason only. To make them to reduce the oil price!!

How do you explain “out of gas” Signs in June? How do you explain heating oil shortages in September?
1318 2018-10-16 21:42:21 Oil. They’re a good partner against terrorism (instrumental in the fight against ISIS, for example), ally against Iran, friendlier to Israel than most. Strategically it’s a no-brainer.
1319 2018-10-16 21:42:20 That whole thread needed oil & moisturizer.
1320 2018-10-16 21:42:14 A tablespoon of olive oil won't kill you. If you want to get wild and crazy use some balsamic vinegar too.

Follow us at @OilChangeUS for the same great bold action to stand up for people – not Big Oil.
1323 2018-10-16 21:42:07 If you remember, that oil was NEVER for American use!  The pipeline was to transport the oil from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, so it could be put on board ships to transport it to Europe!!!
1324 2018-10-16 21:42:06 Everything is made with oil, even your polyester suit!!
1325 2018-10-16 21:42:04 Which land is producing oil in Biafra?
1326 2018-10-16 21:42:01 I got a date tonight and I’m making jambalaya, hence the broth. She told me to get the Condoms. The face mask is because a nigga gotta keep his skin clear so the ladies can sit ya know? Coconut oil is for another meal I’m making later this week
1327 2018-10-16 21:41:59 and out Government in Ottawa wants to build pipelines and sell more oil faster and as a side note - carbon tax everyone
1328 2018-10-16 21:41:59 The causes are well documented @VP - you just have to not be on big oil's payroll, or a disciple of big oil to see it.
1329 2018-10-16 21:41:35 No one that I know of is spending the $$$$$$$ for the high-tech pain patch adhesives. What you get is like a band aid with no patch in it, and oil in it. They are still super expensive. Wore one last weekend, they're great for low and slow long term.

1332 2018-10-16 21:41:24 The United States and Saudi Arabia have had a mutually dependent relationship for seven decades based on a central bargain: the kingdom would pump oil and the superpower would provide security.

1336 2018-10-16 21:40:49 I haven’t washed my car since I got it back (August 24) and I haven’t gotten an oil change since I bought it (Jul 2017)
1337 2018-10-16 21:40:47 I'd trust the Saudis about as far as I can throw a barrel of oil, but I sure as hell don't trust the Turks, Qatar, or AJ (but I repeat myself on these last two.)

1348 2018-10-16 21:39:41 Wind would still need oil because they do use it to lube gears and the turbine. Solar would need mining or you wouldn’t have the solar at all. You would need a ton of solar and wind to supply the grid if you take coal away. Water helps, but once again you need oil and mining for

1352 2018-10-16 21:39:25 more climate change hysteria... everyone knows it's a con game, sell oil for tax revenue while claiming reduced emissions locally, it's like claiming you don't produce polution when you recycle or outsource manufacturing to another country

1364 2018-10-16 21:38:09 Which foolish reform are we enjoying today? The CBN is literally in charge of the economy, was it any better under Sanusi or even now? He was there for 5year, how did he prepare for the fall oil prices which led to devaluation for the Naira? smh
1365 2018-10-16 21:38:08 Perhaps we should be glad that Westminster looks after all the oil for us so we're not tempted to have journalists "just die" with impunity.
1366 2018-10-16 21:37:54 DJT, Pompeo & the rest of the treasonous weasels may simply work w/ MBS on the cover story.

1371 2018-10-16 21:37:12 The United States and Saudi Arabia have had a mutually dependent relationship for seven decades based on a central bargain: the kingdom would pump oil and the superpower would provide security.
1372 2018-10-16 21:37:11 Oooh you need to use this. Smoke a load of garlic or red peppers & you can make some amazing pastes for quick marinades. Marinade feta in chilli oil and smoke it or smoked cashews drizzled in maple syrup & cinnamon 
1373 2018-10-16 21:37:05 I used oil to get them off and it still ripped them out
1374 2018-10-16 21:37:00 One of my "secret dreams" just came true! I got paid to be a model for an essential oil company. I've always wanted to model for health product companies. I figured they wouldn't make me wear toxic make-up or high heels! I've been promised pictures... ;)
1375 2018-10-16 21:36:59 Yes! Sometimes it isn’t noticeable until it’s this bad and starting to flake, use some sort of oil and let it sit for a few and use a fine tooth comb to get it off
1376 2018-10-16 21:36:59 Ask Cruz what innovative plan he’s got Texas! since oil/gas is dated, how to retrain workers??
1377 2018-10-16 21:36:55 no it hasn't, it's just different redirect now. Now we are murderers of innocent people for oil companies.
1378 2018-10-16 21:36:55 If you actually believed in a strong energy industry you would be promoting nuclear power over gas and oil.

1394 2018-10-16 21:35:42 Homemade. I reuse old candle jars and add essential oil blends, so much better for you and the environment, also way more cost effective in the long run.
1395 2018-10-16 21:35:38 See, I Totally agree with you!  What I wanted was more (for the lack of a better term - knowledge) on the issue of why...besides the all-encompassing ace - oil.  I think it should be all Turkey and S.A.

1403 2018-10-16 21:34:47 We still have record high oil differentials, no pipeline, persistent high office vacancy rates, ballooning debt, several credit downgrades. Much of that related to policy and a difficult corner to turn in curbing the deficit.  Meanwhile, a carbon tax doing nothing for the climate
1404 2018-10-16 21:34:42 While you strip away the environment to pay off oil interests that paid you off, we will have to suffer the environmental damage. #VoteHeidi

1407 2018-10-16 21:34:39 Wikipedia is the source of note for all things government and culture now? What are your thoughts on Asians, Indians, Pakistanis in America- on average who have been here less than 2 generations-making by far the most money? Is that a white privilege thing or what?
1408 2018-10-16 21:34:34 Exactly what I was thinking. How can it ‘go wrong’ or as on BBC News ‘botched?’ Imagine if it was a Russian or an Iranian journalist murdered in their embassy. Don’t think ‘went wrong’ or ‘botched’ would be used. I detect fluffier language to protect oil and weapons relations.
1409 2018-10-16 21:34:29 True, but they are the last line of defense against higher oil prices. That doesn’t mean I like them, just pointing out why we coddle them

1422 2018-10-16 21:32:57 Evidence?
1423 2018-10-16 21:32:53 เรื่องไหนค่ะ
1424 2018-10-16 21:32:35 Obviously, U.S. News went a little bias here. This 'survey' is as legit as snake oil cures all ills.
1425 2018-10-16 21:32:33 my advice for anyone painting in oil is to upcharge as fuck because that’s a medium that requires time labor and patience n it’s exhaustive
1426 2018-10-16 21:32:24 Not true. They’ve hated us before oil was ever found there. Domination is the name of the game. They supported Nazi Germany and their Islamic pirates were attacking American ships starting right after our founding as a country. Notice we’re drilling more of our own oil under 45.
1427 2018-10-16 21:32:18 You went all in with MBS: tore up the Iran agreement, participated in Yemen crisis, applauded Qatar blockade, shrugged off kidnapping of Lebanon PM in exchange for vague promises of arms purchases.  Now MBS has winning hand with cut-off of Iranian oil.
1428 2018-10-16 21:32:16 We were working with Saudi Arabia when they were threatening to wipe Israel out and had these abuses if your our ally and sell us oil your allowed to change your mind on Israel if your Iran your not? @CNN @foxnews @msnbc @nytimes @wsj @moveon @TheYoungTurks

1440 2018-10-16 21:31:30 All very good, but your 'plan' not only falls far short of what must be done, but also your investments in and subsidies for the gas & oil industries make a mockery of your climate change plan. At this stage, it's little more than political green-washing.

1464 2018-10-16 21:30:07 Perhaps it would be wise if Alberta concentrated on diversification instead of doubling down on exporting crude. Why not refine it at home and retain a greater share of the profits? Why isn’t it possible to turn oil into food to feed an increasingly hungry, warmer world?

1486 2018-10-16 21:28:13 The Saudi monarchy is best thought of as a brutal corporation.  The ruling family is the board of directors. The country's people and oil are the corporation's workers and property. And when the workers get out of line, they are fired:  i.e. jailed, tortured, and/or killed.

1492 2018-10-16 21:26:52 Is the medias reaction to a non-U.S. journalist, captured in Saudi Arabia, more about causing a 'rift' with a country who has control over oil prices-  Not unlike a witch-hunt 'rift'.
1493 2018-10-16 21:26:31 Yes and also an opportunity to help Ven's figure out how to begin properly using their Oil wealth.
1494 2018-10-16 21:26:30 At a time like this we cant afford to sacrifice moral leader on a plater of oil,billions and bombs. The evidences from #Yemen,#Syria,#SouthernCameroons, #khashoggi etc prove global leadership is going wrong. Leadership should be an issue of people over profit and not vice versa.
1495 2018-10-16 21:26:23 Aren’t we the largest oil exporter in the WORLD? Maybe we should stop exporting it and we control our own prices! AMERICA FIRST! Screw the Arabs!

1515 2018-10-16 21:24:31 How they got away with 911we will never know! We still hold it against them! We have all the oil now we don't need them cut them off!
1516 2018-10-16 21:24:31 Saudi Arabia controls one fifth of the worlds oil supply.  That is not the only thing Saudi’s raise and lower production to effect world oil prices anytime they want. There are many economic factors when discussing Saudi Arabia other then the Presidents financial issues.

1521 2018-10-16 21:23:40 The United States and Saudi Arabia have had a mutually dependent relationship for seven decades based on a central bargain: the kingdom would pump oil and the superpower would provide security.
1522 2018-10-16 21:23:24 Let's be clear about who the murdered Saudi was. He wasn't a "journalist" in the western sense. He sent pieces to the Washington Compost which they published. He was also a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, which opposes all modernizing of Saudi  Arabia, including oil.

A heat pump can be 300-500% efficient, while most new oil furnaces are only around 80% efficiency. As for "Cheap energy" it's not cheap if it costs you the environment.

1634 2018-10-16 21:11:12 The Saudis will do what they feel is their best interest. There will be plenty willing to do business with them behind the scenes. There always is when it comes to oil
1635 2018-10-16 21:10:46 They don’t dare challenge anyone with half a brain cuz the Dem activist press is afraid to be embarrassed. Said Trump would win. Said oil would go back up to 85. Said Obama spied on Trump. Said Obama’s tried to frame Trump. Said Bo weaponized every fed agency to attack opponents
1636 2018-10-16 21:10:33 Fab. Do you make the pastry with real butter or vegetable oil please?
1637 2018-10-16 21:10:26 All I need is an oil change and ain’t nobody even been out to take my keys

1645 2018-10-16 21:10:05 For frame of reference: I would usually ignore stuff like this, as its just snake oil salesmanship. But he trolled me a while ago on a post, so him being one of the above I now send it back

1648 2018-10-16 21:09:43 This dude gave me a discount on my oil change he obvi wants to fuck
1649 2018-10-16 21:09:41 Unfortunately, I can’t get that exact scent in a sheer. It’s made from an oil that isn’t lip safe (skin safe for the sprays though). The only part I can use is the apple.
1650 2018-10-16 21:09:40 Here's the other mug bread recipe I use that does make great grilled cheese: 

1 egg
1/4 cup almond flour
1/2 tsp oil
1/4 tsp baking powder

Lightly oil a large mug. Mix together all the ingredients. Microwave for 3 minutes.
1651 2018-10-16 21:09:24 Oil wasn’t used until the 1800s for motor engines. Europe attacked other continents for natural resources, specifically gold. Africa had an abundance of gold which at the time was the most important resource.
1652 2018-10-16 21:09:12 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed #TexasDebate
1653 2018-10-16 21:09:09 @realDonaldTrump needs to break off any deals with Saudi Arabia and stop any oil imports from coming in. #IWillWalk if it means these savages suffer for what they have done. @Acosta get @PressSec to give us a comment on this disgusting act.
1654 2018-10-16 21:09:09 Bros abeg find me small money make I buy oil cause I m not OK with it

1656 2018-10-16 21:09:01 So in rapid succession the Govt has announced it will underwrite the costs of oil spills from drilling (previously unlimited liability on oil cos) and it will effectively issue a new permit to OMV to drill in deep sea for more oil. I think they read a different IPCC report to me
1657 2018-10-16 21:08:57 Y’all I hate paying to get my oil changed 
1658 2018-10-16 21:08:50 Palm oil is mostly saturated fat, relatively low in linoleic acid, and is the main fat source in the natural chimpanzee diet. Palm oil production practices often involve extensive deforestation, but from a nutritional perspective it is probably the healthiest plant fat.
1659 2018-10-16 21:08:48 free oil change 
1660 2018-10-16 21:08:47 911 Middled Eastern came from Saudi killing 3000 people from the Twin tower. Why are we still doing business-with this people. We got enough oil and natural resources right from our own backyard!
1661 2018-10-16 21:08:45 So the worst famine in 100 years could occur with up 13 million Yemen civilians starved if Saudi led coalition continues bombing Yemen as per the UN, yet Canada is still buying Saudi oil?? What?
1662 2018-10-16 21:08:41 The Middle East is such a fucking mess. Thanks Brits, WW2, and oil!
1663 2018-10-16 21:08:40 NV energy is fighting this so hard, because with deregulation they’d go from generating and delivering energy to pretty much just delivering it meaning they’d lose a ton of money. The steel monopoly was broken up over a century ago, oil monopolies shouldn’t still be around.
1664 2018-10-16 21:08:40 Epsom salt baths with drops of lavender oil added to the bath helps my Mum sleep better. She has them an hour before bed. She always eggsorstid coz of her rheumatoid, fibro & stupud commute to werk. Hope your Mum gets better soon & feels more like herself agen. 
1665 2018-10-16 21:08:32 Just do a test:

Today you cook a meal using vegetable oils and see how much you eat until it starts to feel wrong to eat more.

Tomorrow you make the same meal, but you use butter instead of vegetable oil and see how much you can eat.

You'll be amazed!
1666 2018-10-16 21:08:32 Put some lavender oil in that diffuser hun
1667 2018-10-16 21:08:32 These undesirable (fallen) spirits know one thing: they are cursed. All fallen spirits know this! But to make them flee requires BLESSING. Man is like a container full of water where water represents every manner of fallen spirit. Blessing is like pouring oil into the container.
1668 2018-10-16 21:08:16 Saudi Arabia is a heinious country. Run by heathens who ironically prostrate five times a day. Morally corrupt psychopaths high on oil running wild chopping anyone and everyone who stands up to them (but not US because SA feeds upon the teat of US)
1669 2018-10-16 21:08:12 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed #TexasDebate
1670 2018-10-16 21:08:01 Europe is massively diverse area with didn't resources. Norway has huge oil resources yet it was never attacked. Switzerland has few natural resources yet it is amongst the most advanced nations in the planet. As is Japan.
1671 2018-10-16 21:07:56 Oil pressure switch failed in the 335d and killed the engine wiring loom.

1674 2018-10-16 21:07:39 No argument here - being serious - why do we need to be involved?  Why can’t they handle this themselves?  Why are we always in the middle?  Don’t say oil
1675 2018-10-16 21:07:37 Womp womp. Sorry that they had to spend money from the previous disaster piece (who was not NDP) they inherited and are about to get us out of the recession. Oh, and without a primary focus on coal or oil. Please, vote for who you want, but educate yourselves.
1676 2018-10-16 21:07:34 Bonus 4 both is DT & Saudis killed a mutual enemy: a journalist, a member of the “free press”.

I expect Saudi threat of cutting off oil flow 2 West 2 give pretense 4 DT proposing lifting RU sanctions, so Rosneft oil can flow 2 reduce dependence (ie killing 2 birds w/1 stone).
1677 2018-10-16 21:07:25 Its not about the number of troops its not a conventional war, its an insurgency, they attack soft targets, if na conventional war their career go don end since, its more of intelligence and conspiracy.
1678 2018-10-16 21:07:19 Explain Yemen then , why are “peaceful Muslims “ massacring other “peaceful Muslims “ ??? Don’t preach religion of peace shit to me , ye sell your souls to keep the price of oil up , ye buy weapons off big corporations then drop them on your own ppl
1679 2018-10-16 21:07:15 Right but its a much better to have them buying from us than China, Russia or France Dont forget its like a car dealer. When suckers buy “service for life” they are financing oil changes at a premium plus interest We got them for a looong time. We can always say no more parts.
1680 2018-10-16 21:07:09 Um? No. People in the military are not protecting us, they’re literally protecting oil fields. The US has a higher military budget than any other country, several times more. We have no equal enemies.

1682 2018-10-16 21:06:58 Yes! Give the Gulf states to Iran! Let's have $200 a barrel Oil, put the economy in recession and start a broader Middle east war! Great policy Rand!
1683 2018-10-16 21:06:52 Every President from Reagan on has been in the pocket of the Saudis.  They know we need oil and military bases.
1684 2018-10-16 21:06:46 Who won't notice the palm oil teeth
1685 2018-10-16 21:06:23 I’m truly sorry if you have been negatively impacted by the crash of O&G in Alberta. We were told those jobs were secure for 25-30 years. Who told us all that lie.

Shale oil and fracking are the new sparkly diamond. Cheaper to drill, refine and sell.
1686 2018-10-16 21:06:16 I told my dad my car has been telling me to get an oil change for like a month now and he got super mad at me and i was like “ayyyy chill it was two days” AND HE BELIEVED ME AND APOLOGIZED FOR YELLING AT ME BUT I LIED ITS BEEN LIKE A MONTH AND A HALF IM SORRY DAD
1687 2018-10-16 21:06:14 "UR WILLFULLY IGNORANT" says the gal mindlessly parroting every cliche she heard freshman year at Oberlein.

1689 2018-10-16 21:06:14 9-11 hijackers = Saudi
Proponents of radical Islam = Saudis
Killing journalists and children (on top of 3000 Americans) = Saudi

But give us oil and we'll be your best friends because we have no values apparently.

1693 2018-10-16 21:06:06 Tobi cooked today at evening and I think I'm finally out of order  also for the cleaning and the lower work like to bring and to hold and to cut the onion and to look for the oil and so, but the rest he did it all alone 
1694 2018-10-16 21:05:59 The LNP love of oil and coal will be its downfall. Renewables are overtaking coal, electric cars and hydrogen will power cars before long. And live export of sheep and cattle cannot end too soon.
1695 2018-10-16 21:05:53 Liberal hysteria and denial of facts is way more dangerous than anything short of Dick Cheney starting an oil war

1698 2018-10-16 21:05:42 SA threatens to raise oil to double. A bunch of people would care about them then. As usual Trump talks tough but acts like a coward & backs down. Just like russia Korea Iran. I don't care about party. I just want some competency. As stormy says red is the small dick party.
1699 2018-10-16 21:05:35 I'll pay $25 per barrel of oil in place in Oklahoma if the reservoir is a 30 ft thick, 200 md, 20% porosity, 85% So 35 API sweet @GNSensay

1704 2018-10-16 21:05:04 I pay more taxes than Trump does! I'm fairly certain and I'm nowhere near his income bracket. That's how this greedy administration rolls!

1713 2018-10-16 21:04:15 They aren’t our friends. We don’t get the oil for free either.

1719 2018-10-16 21:03:30 I got ripped off on an oil change special a few years ago. I bought my washer and dryer for my new house there on clearance when ours was going out of business.
1720 2018-10-16 21:03:15 Idk if I've been as high as I am now since when I first smoked. That oil ain't normal. Got food warming up and can barely type this tweet let alone get up. Halp.
1721 2018-10-16 21:03:02 Nope Just go to Home Depot or a Chainsaw shop and tell them you want bar and chain oil. It’s all the same

1728 2018-10-16 21:02:45 I dont think the Unions were faultless in this. Oil, yes you are right but I fear all would have done it. They were tough times, and not ones I remember with fondness politically. But at least some things she got right, whereas this lot...

1730 2018-10-16 21:02:38 The Saudi's did this Oil Embargo in 1978 I believe, not looking it up, Jimmy Carter tried to move the US off of oil dependence, however Reagan jumped right back in bed with the Saudi's. Carter knew the oil money fueled wars in the middle east.
1731 2018-10-16 21:02:31 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.
1732 2018-10-16 21:02:28 He is likely getting his data from Greenpeace or he would know the oil sector doesn’t get any breaks not available to other sectors.
1733 2018-10-16 21:02:26 1) Turkey is not a reliable source of info
2) We are now the world's largest producer of oil
3) Trump isn't going to fall prey to ill informed persons demanding a knee jerk reaction without facts
4) Despite your impotant wailing, Trump is trying to get the facts. SOS there now.
1734 2018-10-16 21:02:25 Is it really? The Bush’s were pretty cozy with Saudi’s Arabia too: oil
1735 2018-10-16 21:02:23 It is such a lottery. All our bodies are so different. I also tried the CBD capsules along with the oil.

1761 2018-10-16 20:59:44 I'm a small business owner. In five networking groups, including a Cranfield business school one. I know NO pro brexit small business owners. Anyone that does... Needs their oil being changed.
1762 2018-10-16 20:59:41 He could have just called her a “whore.” Who hires a woman to falsely claim Justice Kavenaugh gang raped her? Avenatti did because he’s the lowest of low and has no moral compass. No one with a brain cell respects this snake oil porn lawyer.
1763 2018-10-16 20:59:38 The only reason they don’t want Syria to regain the oil is because the World Bank gave loans to the opposition £15-16 billion worth based on funding from other countries. How else will they get their money back if these so-called rebels are defeated?
1764 2018-10-16 20:59:35 One very dispensible person will not, and, sadly, cannot stop oil flows, weapons sales, and military base protocol just because of the political situation. In the "Old" days, perhaps, but, the oil pipeline is the Royal's (Trump) card in this one. We ARE stuck.
1765 2018-10-16 20:59:35 Lol  waspapping i think this is were we should be friends
1766 2018-10-16 20:59:33 Diced tomato + diced avocado + salt + pepper + olive oil + balsamic = best snack ever
1767 2018-10-16 20:59:29 Its terrible my sister, especially oshodi,Ikej, iyana ipaja axis
1768 2018-10-16 20:59:18 It is only in #Africa that our political leaders campaign with provision of good roads, water etc. 
When will we Africans write our better history? 

Respect to @PatriceLumumbaI Respect to @NelsonMandela. They were men of HONOR

1770 2018-10-16 20:59:08 In fact, you have very little financial interest....snake oil salesman....stop drinking the kool aid.....#incompetent
1771 2018-10-16 20:59:08 I tend to believe the prince.
He has been a great partner in crushing isis and cutting off funding.
He has helped to keep oil prices low, which helps export inflation via the petro dollar.  Even Wilbur Ross admitted recently how low our inflation is for this amount of growth.
1772 2018-10-16 20:59:08 I agree Robin, of course, it must always been seen through the prism of how she treated the unions,how she wasted North Sea Oil revenue of ideological privatisation and her appalling treatment of working people.
1773 2018-10-16 20:58:48 I bet he's having  meetings w Big Oil.

#Scummo #auspol #kickbacks
1774 2018-10-16 20:58:45 You do realize that you need oil and mining industries to even make solar and wind possible right?
1775 2018-10-16 20:58:36 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed #TexasDebate
1776 2018-10-16 20:58:09 @senatemajldr McConnell is an old time snake oil salesman.!  I just hope "The Mob" doesn't Tar and Feather him, and run him outta town on a rail.!  @GOP @DNC @SenateDems @HouseDemocrats @Moveon
1777 2018-10-16 20:58:04 I came off it and went on CBD oil and honestly girl Prozac was terrible it made me lazy and I put no effort into friendships I was like a shell of myself lost my personality completely buttt each person handles it differently it does help lots of people!!
1778 2018-10-16 20:58:04 Why do I have the sudden urge to change the oil in my car?
1779 2018-10-16 20:57:56 palm oil is linked to cancer
1780 2018-10-16 20:57:50 Yeah good shout. Fry light is never the same as proper olive oil 
1781 2018-10-16 20:57:46 On the draft floor Tambellini was working on a deal with Chiarelli to trade for the 2nd pick. Chiarelli wanted Eberle, who had just come off those world Junior triumphs, but Tambo said no. It was also mentioned in Oil Change.
1782 2018-10-16 20:57:44 My purchase at the store today: chicken broth. Coconut oil. Condoms. And face masks. Lmaooo I dunno why but that’s funny
1783 2018-10-16 20:57:41 I do agree that the Punto Fijo democracy was in many ways a miracle. The level of democracy attained with that history and challenges. But don’t overstate the difficulties of democratizing with oil rents. The evidence is at least mixed. See Haber and Menaldo or Dunning.
1784 2018-10-16 20:57:35 Today in Strumpetville:
Stress is high & you decide to buy CBC oil RIGHT NOW to hopefully stop the eye twitching
Jumped in the car to go buy it! 
Did not take note of store address. 
Got lost in the ‘hood. 

1785 2018-10-16 20:57:32 I wing it, but thisish: 350 degree oven; clean seeds and pat dry, spread onto cookie sheet, drizzle w olive oil &
sprinkle with sea salt. Roast until brown & crispy looking, stirring every 10 mins or so.
1786 2018-10-16 20:57:28 Y yall dont come see me shit im handin out oil changes like it aint shit baby

ASX futures +0.5%.
$A 0.714 as $US index -0.1%.
1788 2018-10-16 20:57:05 Your failure to understand what white privilege is does not make it a myth. It makes you willfully ignorant. 

BTW your horse shit comment drips of privilege, implying as it does that white people are above doing dirty work.
1789 2018-10-16 20:57:03 ....
you missed the look I just gave you, asshole. 
Not that kind of "oil."

I might be in a conversation with JR, but I'm not JR.  
1790 2018-10-16 20:56:59 Lexus in shop for oil change. A real hardship for $tsla lovers, but door to door delivery from great service crew @LexusGreenwich. Best part a brand new loaner...push button, go. No outages or connectivity problems with this drive.
1791 2018-10-16 20:56:35 Convert it to his 2020 presidential run
1792 2018-10-16 20:56:26 @realDonaldTrump Why do you keep collaborating with Saudi murderers who behead and chop hands on a whim. We dont need their oil. You can fill U.S. coffers by some higher-minded goal than selling these barbarians weapons. Unless you are using Khashoggi as a symbol of something.
1793 2018-10-16 20:56:20 It's their drug of choice.
1794 2018-10-16 20:56:12 I’m came into Ralph Sellers for a $40 oil change and they trying to make me leave with $1000 new tires
1795 2018-10-16 20:55:59 I didn’t serve because I’m not a fucking idiot. I graduated in 2005, I wasn’t going to get sent home in a body bag defending oil companies.
1796 2018-10-16 20:55:38 This weather fucked up so much for the oil show but it’s not stopping anyone 
1797 2018-10-16 20:55:37 These guys are professional snake oil salesmen, it's how they lure so many men to the "movement", they're charming and peddle a bunch of lies that on the surface seem plausible.
Cassie didn't bother to scratch the surface.
1798 2018-10-16 20:55:31 This oil my aunt made for me for my scalp feels so good 
1799 2018-10-16 20:55:31 You shouldn’t be. I wasn’t expecting anything less
1800 2018-10-16 20:55:25 Really? I don't know ooo. But wat kind of morals make u promise wat u know u aren't capable of. Is $1 equal to 1 naira now. Is our president now controlling oil prices? I'm not saying morals is bad, bt ryt nw its Competence vs Integrity. Choose one.
1801 2018-10-16 20:55:16 W'abor loss
1802 2018-10-16 20:55:05 I love it so keep it up. Also, is the mayo sear just what it sounds like? Instead of butter/oil, coat in mayo then throw on the skillet?
1803 2018-10-16 20:55:01 🛇This message can't be viewed because you don't have cooking oil.
1804 2018-10-16 20:54:50 I think your forgetting the foreign policies of a father and son pair of oil men like a bad dream.
1805 2018-10-16 20:54:50 When the coffee some of that 40 weight oil >>>>
1806 2018-10-16 20:54:45 The way #Germany are going down ehn!! They'll soon find oil. Or better still Hitler's bones. 
1807 2018-10-16 20:54:35 Stockley obviously playing with better players with Exeter City, not some second rate oil riggers in the joke league 
1808 2018-10-16 20:54:32 Liar liar US Cuts off Saudi oil imports! @realDonaldTrump Pants on fire 4 killer SCP!
1809 2018-10-16 20:54:14 When did Britain, France and Europe EVER let ANY country live in Peace,When Africans stopped being Britains, France n Europe’s slaves in Africa and India, they started being the slaves of Western Oil Con-glomerates and Western Banking
1810 2018-10-16 20:54:14 Personally, I believe they thought they had enough oil. If they didn’t, they would have brought more. I think this reflects a conviction that Jesus is coming earlier. Alternatively, it could reflect ignorance about about the timing, with the assumption it will all pan out.
1811 2018-10-16 20:54:10 this dude offered me dabs in exchange for some pussy, MY DUDE IM NOT GOONNA FUCK YOU FOR SOME OIL
1812 2018-10-16 20:54:03 They fenced the oil for gold from the Saudis !
That's why this Saudi newsman was murdered in Turkey by Saudi thugs !
1813 2018-10-16 20:54:01 I have holy oil....
1814 2018-10-16 20:54:00 .@EPAAWheeler, the power industry, which includes coal and oil burning power plants, has invested $18 billion in cleaning up dangerous pollutants, and overturning the Mercury & Air Toxic Standards would be disastrous. Protect our environment and invest in our future!
1815 2018-10-16 20:53:52 The same reason it’s all so tasty: Butter & oil 
1816 2018-10-16 20:53:46 Plantain, palm oil, nsam or Ngolo, snail, dried shrimp or fish your choice, scent leaves or uziza,
1817 2018-10-16 20:53:46 I just keep getting more and more oil
1818 2018-10-16 20:53:33 おはようございます。もうすぐ６時ですね
1819 2018-10-16 20:53:20 I was shocked ne , Ba amana
1820 2018-10-16 20:53:10 or the towers. Not when you're this addicted to oil and war.... It's all for sale. Even the viability of the planet. (He'd sell his soul if he had one.)
1821 2018-10-16 20:53:07 Hey, numbnuts, haven't you seen the amount of new oil fields found in Scottish waters?
Stop scaremongering and get behind making your country a prosperous place to live, instead of being subservient to the psychopaths at WM
1822 2018-10-16 20:53:01 you need to be taking CBD oil NOW
1823 2018-10-16 20:52:55 I hate Rail Canyon [Heroes], Oil Ocean [2], Sandopilus [3&K] & Wacky Workbench [CD]
1824 2018-10-16 20:52:54 Saudi Arabia is not our friend. Enough of the games, it’s time for us to expose their hate to the world.

No amount of oil should buy our silence.
1825 2018-10-16 20:52:51 Cottage INDUSTRY ! BIG OIL aka BIG PHARMA and The BANKS  ARE NOT ALLOWED To PARTISAPATE IN ANY WAY ! That WAY THE PEOPLE CONTROL THE MONEY ! Then What are WE going to Do ? Make a Better world for Me And You And EVERYONE TOO ?

1827 2018-10-16 20:52:18 You don't understand not wanting to benefit from unearned privilege? It has nothing to do with "crushing guilt" or self-abuse! It's simply doing what you can to point out white privilege when it goes unnoticed. "God" allows people to be selfish and think that's virtuous. Sad.
1828 2018-10-16 20:52:11 i have to detox, wash, hot oil treatment and twist my hair all before my husband is honored at the Hip Hop awards 
1829 2018-10-16 20:51:57 @chrislhayes why aren't the dems talking about the highest gas prices in history after the oil companies got a huge tax break and a reduction in regulations. Shouldn't we have the lowest prices in history right now
1830 2018-10-16 20:51:56 thank god my client had avocado oil in her kitchen
1831 2018-10-16 20:51:45 What effect? Oil is just harder to light, needs atomization but once it lights, watch out. One gallon of oil contains the same BTU value of 140 cubic feet of natural gas.
1832 2018-10-16 20:51:42 Obama tried to ween us off of foreign oil by increasing u.s energy production both clean and oil & natraul gas @CNN @foxnews @msnbc @nytimes @moveon @TheYoungTurks @history
1833 2018-10-16 20:51:41 Cash and oil again
1834 2018-10-16 20:51:30 What's next for Stormy? Perhaps a 'wanna be' celebrity oil wrestling match with Tonya Harding.  Avenatti can be the guest referee.
1835 2018-10-16 20:51:19 western brands trying to get me to put coconut oil on my skin... on my FACE... the motherfucking AUDACITY im looking at you GLOSSIER WITH THAT COCONUT OIL ASS HIGHLIGHTER w-what the fuq

1839 2018-10-16 20:51:02 Really? @elonmusk's upsetting large established corp's w/ @SpaceX (the airline industry) and @Tesla (the entire automotive industry - big auto + dealers and other ICE services like lube and service - as well as big energy (oil and gas)).
1840 2018-10-16 20:51:00 If they threaten to raise oil prices....let's open up government lands to drill for oil and natural gas!!! 100% energy independent!!!!!
1841 2018-10-16 20:51:00 Yea you gotta stay on it bro I take a spoonful half black seed oil have honey every morning
1842 2018-10-16 20:50:56 Every day I receive requests for campaign donations from well meaning

THREE TRILLION DOLLARS IN STOLEN OIL !
1843 2018-10-16 20:50:48 Liar liar pants on fire! Cut off saudi oil! @realDonaldTrump SaudiCP shows 2018 Demcons support! Pants on fire 4 killers! No saudi invest...
1844 2018-10-16 20:50:36 Bought a big stake in Hurricane Energy exploring for oil to the West of Shetland with billion barrel prospects. It will be the new oil frontier house broker is Morgan Stanley #HUR
1845 2018-10-16 20:50:17 @ForexStopHunter Remember when you interviewed me and I said oil would go back up to 85? You know how many people dared to tell me 50 bucks a barrel was the new normal? I kept buying more and more oil from 40-57. It’ll go even higher. Could you send me the video of the interview
1846 2018-10-16 20:50:07 I want to throw away all my normal olive oil and only buy oil harvested by hand by a handsome Italian man.
1847 2018-10-16 20:50:06 What if I only have £4997 but a bottle of baby oil?
1848 2018-10-16 20:50:01 WHO DARE BAD TALK MY UFO OIL? 
1849 2018-10-16 20:49:59 In Mt 7, though, He says He never knew them. To the foolish virgins, He says, “I do not know you.” I believe the oil is the Holy Spirit and running out is apostasy.
1850 2018-10-16 20:49:48 He needs my beard oil
1851 2018-10-16 20:49:44 Yeah some people's Idea of a service is just a oil and filter change they fail to remember about Air, fuel and cabin filters! Nice one keeping 4x4 owners phone numbers handy in case we get some of the white stuff. Keep up the good work 
1852 2018-10-16 20:49:37 i dropped a bit of avocado on one of my adorable pink suede shoes plz pray for me  second application of arrowroot powder to absorb the oil....  will blot with vinegar next.
1853 2018-10-16 20:49:27 Hi ass face @AtlanticFyoo how's the oregano oil going?
1854 2018-10-16 20:49:26 "I will ask for the report of the B20 program to ensure that it is properly implemented. I was informed that there is problem in supply of CPO (crude palm oil). I need report about that," #2019PilihJokowi #JokowiLagi #Jokowi1xLagi
1855 2018-10-16 20:49:12 Teresa May, we do not need your oil, your wars, greed, destruction and hate; we want to live in harmony with each other and the planet, clear off and leave us alone, your time is over. #ToriesOut
1856 2018-10-16 20:49:08 君を揚げたいな…君を炒めたいな…君に僕を絡めたいな…僕は君のそんな存在になりたい。いや、既になってるだろう?
1857 2018-10-16 20:49:06 #Khashoggi-You need to have 250 Billion Barrels of oil to clean every shit you do and all pretexts given to clean the mess are accepted all over the world, but a journalist get even held for questioning in Pakistan or another "NONOily"state, the mother of freedom gets into danger
1858 2018-10-16 20:49:03 I don’t like palm oil that much.
1859 2018-10-16 20:49:03 You know I can't afford olive oil on a Teachers salary  I'll try with fish oil and let you know how it goes . That time I also want to try Athi's hummus   don't you miss the Graca days when we would get excited by 2 scoops of ice cream on a Sunday ? 
1860 2018-10-16 20:48:59 Also, next time add chorizo  the oil comes out and flavours everything so nicely!
1861 2018-10-16 20:48:57 just dropped my oil on the carpet and it landed right side up on the parchment paper alexa play gods plan
1862 2018-10-16 20:48:47 If t you don’t believe what he’s saying he’s going to raise oil/gas prices . You are so screwed
1863 2018-10-16 20:48:41 That maybe but Saudi Arabia is not likely to disrupt a large customer like US as their economy is heavily dependent on oil exports
1864 2018-10-16 20:48:34 Thanks for tip. I have been using tea tree oil with very positive results too.
1865 2018-10-16 20:48:30 Ehen

1867 2018-10-16 20:48:09 My "hot" oil treatment stalled out when I couldn't find my hair dryer...Now i feel foolish for having wrapped my head in plastic.
1868 2018-10-16 20:48:07 netflix moved expenses to the 4th quarter.  In the prior quarter they missed on subscriptions, this time they exceeded. csx I am not surprised due to the trade war and oil surge.  ual missed earnings beat revs slightly.
1869 2018-10-16 20:48:03 So blind they don't see their racism. Even worse they're so stupid they don't know it.
1870 2018-10-16 20:48:01 There has been 4 Ice Ages during the last 800 million years. So there must have been a warming between each one to have the next one. So there wasn’t any cars, factories and oil well. So how did they happen????????
1871 2018-10-16 20:47:47 Trying to drive and eat a bagel, the butter dripped on my titty. 

That’s agg, now I have an oil stain on my tank

1873 2018-10-16 20:47:26 It has to be so exhausting trying to find things to be enraged about.
1874 2018-10-16 20:47:08 Actually we have an agreement with them so that they only sell their oil in us dollars to keep the demand of us dollars up if we embargo them they will stop selling oil in us dollars and our markets will be flooded with extra money causing extreme inflation
1875 2018-10-16 20:47:00 oil
1876 2018-10-16 20:46:48 It is much better ... even the oil splattering is worth it ...

1878 2018-10-16 20:46:43  rubbed down with neck oil 
1879 2018-10-16 20:46:38 Oil futures climb in electronic trade as API data reportedly shows a decline in U.S. crude supply
1880 2018-10-16 20:46:36 Dem and gop presidents, leaders, pr firms, lobbyists, corporations have facilitated and enabled this awful dictatorial regime in Saudi Arabia for 50 years.  They did it for oil, money, advantage, and we are reaping today what has been sewed. Time to hold the Saudis accountable.
1881 2018-10-16 20:46:36 She was responsible for blowing the windfall of North Sea oil and wrecked British industry. Utterly heinous creature that she was!
1882 2018-10-16 20:46:34 US is number one supplier of oil to the US.
1883 2018-10-16 20:46:29 We have 12 years to remove our dependence on oil or we all go up on smoke. The opportunity has been staring us in the face for 20 years.
1884 2018-10-16 20:46:24 K - thanks.  I added soy lecithin, too gummy.  Gonna try again with next batch of tincture rather than oil.  Thanks!   PpP
1885 2018-10-16 20:46:16 The rats are Murdoch, Koch, and Adelson.  Big oil, big banks, big Pharma, mining and agribusiness all give more to the GOP that they do to Democrats.
1886 2018-10-16 20:46:14 I agree with Owen here. We should not be supporting Saudi Arabia no matter what they pay us or their threats to raise oil prices. To hell with that authoritarian asshat of a nation.
1887 2018-10-16 20:46:06 Oil painting ni aku rasa aku mampu abstract je tu pun mcm....  Tak mampu realistic
1888 2018-10-16 20:46:05 @POTUS What the heck is going on with the Saudi's... Are we so afraid that they might cut off cheap oil, that we let them cut off arms, legs, and head of a reporter? Things like this don't happen by accident.

1899 2018-10-16 20:44:35 "Device built with oil" (plastic) uses 4% or less of our total oil extraction, arent burned (CO2 release), and can be synthesized without fossil fuels.

Plastic manufacturing is not a problem. Oil subsidies, tax breaks, and further investment in oil for use in transportation is.
1900 2018-10-16 20:44:34 The Saudi's would be euchered - if they spontaneously bought weapons systems from Russia or China, their Boeing / Raytheon equipped F-15's would not be serviceable. Moreover, North American reliance on Saudi oil is greatly diminished. The only viable export they have is jihad.
1901 2018-10-16 20:44:24 Pathetic. No let others have the right to think and do for themselves but be subjugated and made to comply. Stinking message and says to me, they’re threatened and therefore can not tolerate dissenters because their own hold is tenuous.
1902 2018-10-16 20:44:15 Well we can't stop supporting them or we will have rapid inflation since Saudi Arabia only sells their oil in us dollars to keep the value of them up
1903 2018-10-16 20:43:58 Somebody tell her we're all pink on the inside
1904 2018-10-16 20:43:56 The US remains a net importer of oil and is vulnerable to any significant supply decreases or supply increases.
1905 2018-10-16 20:43:52 Why do oil changes take foreverrrrr 
1906 2018-10-16 20:43:44 More of a problem than the high carb count may be the extremely high level of soybean oil & various soy products in those rations. In some cases certain medications & other factors in conjunction with high levels of soy in the diet.
1907 2018-10-16 20:43:33 No creo que haga falta un estudio muy completo. Si se lo usaría 30 días por año, el costo del mmbtu efectivamente entregado es mas alto que el gas oil. Esto ya lo vimos. Bolivia es un grave error, pienso

1909 2018-10-16 20:43:04 Actually, the industry pulled out when the price of oil crashed. Shale oil is the new sparkling diamond. You want your job back, that’s understandable. Recognize that with climate change looming, O&G will never return to its former glory here. It could be worse. Saskatchewan?

1919 2018-10-16 20:42:29 I know. I hate people’s fake outrage. They ain’t pissed at the fact they get Saudi money for weapons. And saudi oil. They ain’t pissed at trump hates the media. But then they want trump to cut ties with Saudi. Lol.

1925 2018-10-16 20:42:00 They consider them a shared fryer but they’re in their own fryer next to the chicken tender fryer and there isn’t an oil barrier. We are comfortable with shared fryers so it depends on how you feel about that.

1940 2018-10-16 20:39:50 I thought it means "work harder" like adding more oil in the engine and it'll run faster/stronger. 
1941 2018-10-16 20:39:22 cushing has lost too much weight over these past few months...It needs a little bit of oil to be efficient and effective. Current levels a tad too low.  
1942 2018-10-16 20:39:21 The screen that looks like an iPad as the info Centre is so easy to use. $$$ stand in my way of owning one.

1950 2018-10-16 20:38:18 The US is still a net importer but yes the market is flooded with cheaper shale oil. The industry did that to itself. AB oil is lower quality or more expensive to produce. That is the free market speaking.
1951 2018-10-16 20:38:11 I hate when bread is made using olive oil like i can taste it now 
1952 2018-10-16 20:37:54 They had oil but no understanding...kind of like going to church but learning no truth. This coincides with Matthew 7:22-23. In Matthew 7:23 that word iniquity means lawlessness. It wasn't about the oil but lack of truth.

1954 2018-10-16 20:37:49 A good work speaks for itself. U can only tell a blind man that there is no oil in d soup but u can't tell him there is no salt. He will feel it himself
1955 2018-10-16 20:37:48 You mean meeting targets matters more than the target? A bunch of individual policies isn't a good measure either. 

As you know that opens to door to claiming oil sands expanding pipelines are part of the climate plan while a target forces a look at the hard math.

1962 2018-10-16 20:37:21 Both parties are to blame. What needs to happen is instead of putting the price tag on the American people we need to start taxing the oil companies and all these corporations that benefit from the tax cut. It’s only fair being that the tax cuts didn’t do as projected.
1963 2018-10-16 20:37:15 I have college aged friends who’d never had popcorn that was cooked in oil and topped with real butter until we made it for them.

1967 2018-10-16 20:36:49 The argument is that once the prime purchasers leave the petro dollar, the non-dollar denominated oil will cost less than those that buy via the Petro-dollar (USD), as this gap widens, the price will go up without even see a rise in demand.

1994 2018-10-16 20:34:23 No. The USA is a net exporter of oil now. The pipelines are full of American oil now. Before Obama did this they would take all the oil and paid more. Now it goes there but they’re not scrambling to get out oil now. Not like before.

2007 2018-10-16 20:33:26 We don’t need their oil anymore, we’re energy independent. We export oil now. No more blackmail from OPEC. Easier said than done, but we should sanction them at the very least, maybe cut ties. This is like isis as a country. Sharia law. Unacceptable!
2008 2018-10-16 20:33:25 Just saying they are sending their oil (which, let's be real, is cheaper than bottled water, toxic, and expensive to store) in return for dollars, which then they have to send back to us to finance deficit or buy shitloads of military equipment
2009 2018-10-16 20:33:23 No, no it's not. Diesel and jet engines run the world, we will need oil for a very long time.

2013 2018-10-16 20:32:57 something that’s helped me meal prep/cook my own food is remembering that we don’t know what restaurants use to cook their food & what’s in it (oil, bacteria, etc)

2020 2018-10-16 20:31:45 So? Trumps first trip was to the Muslim world too. It shows the importance of oil. Obama was building bridges and sought peace. Trump was ensuring funding for his hotels & golf courses.  Everyone is using each other. But Trump put himself first, not country.
2021 2018-10-16 20:31:35 Trump: So Canada? Can you send us more oil?
Canada: I dunno... Depends on who's asking.
2022 2018-10-16 20:31:33 If they are selling at a loss that is their own fault for over producing. We have more capacity to move oil than ever before. We need to slow down and maximize this finite resource.
2023 2018-10-16 20:31:33 He owned the house even before he became a governor, case closed. Dig more, the crude oil is not far

2025 2018-10-16 20:31:15 Now, as I watch the sunrise.
Ah, the smell of oil, the morning light.
There's but one shadow cast on the asphalt.
2026 2018-10-16 20:31:13 My nephew had cradle cap late too. We used coconut oil with a soft brush, or washcloth and just rubbed it off gently.
2027 2018-10-16 20:30:55 Окей, я и так периодически чищу, но все равно спасибо
2028 2018-10-16 20:30:48 When I was growing up we had free X and Y, why can’t it still be free? There were few of you then and oil receipts could cover easily, if it has to be free now, we have to pay.
2029 2018-10-16 20:30:40 I have to disagree. He had a large stake in a startup that went on to become a behemoth, and they didn’t sell weapons or oil but software. He kept his shares when he left Microsoft in 1983.
2030 2018-10-16 20:30:35 #Oil #fuel emergency must be declare by 3rd world countries & even western countries. Why waste valuable funds which can be used to built hospitals, houses, schools & feed millions, when public transport facilities r available in each nation. People will be disturbed for a while!
2031 2018-10-16 20:30:34 Yeah was quite lazy on my Deathwing: Ceramite White + Nuln Oil. Gives light grey feathers but not so bad on their bone armour. For the Ravenwing though I went for Celestra Grey, Drakenhoff Nightshade then Ceramite White.

2035 2018-10-16 20:30:14 Must be part of Saudi Arabia's diversification strategy... When the oil runs out they can start a murder for hire business.

2037 2018-10-16 20:30:03 JLR said yesterday he’s been criticising Bridges’ decisions internally.

We know he opposed the leak inquiry. What else? Issues in his transport portfolio? Promise to restart oil & gas exploration?

Lots more to come I’m sure.

2040 2018-10-16 20:29:30 Capitalism wins over. If solar and wind can produce electricity cheaper than coal/gas/oil then it's a no-brainer.
2041 2018-10-16 20:29:28 It would be the most ironic thing ever if we got taken over by oil merchants and it would be absolutely hilarious
2042 2018-10-16 20:29:24 How do I know which companies use unsustainable palm oil?
2043 2018-10-16 20:29:23 But global oil price dropped, so y should subsidy be DAT high??
2044 2018-10-16 20:29:19 And gun companies should for shootings, and coal and oil companies for global warming, alcohol for AA, pharma’s for opioid addicts, fast food for diabetes, tobacco and asbestos for cancer?  When do we stop?  Or, let government with tax revenue for all these...
2045 2018-10-16 20:29:16 Huge congratulations to Liz Flett who became the first artist to sell work through tWIGTŷ Pawb!

Pence @VP apparently likes big oil money more than his children and future grandchildren.
Helluva thing to gamble on, Mike.

2049 2018-10-16 20:28:37 Globalists are killing species. I wonder what the studies show from the huge BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico?  And what happened to the nuclear reactor that was affected by Hurricane Michael? Have you heard, yet?

2053 2018-10-16 20:28:28 If President Trump was angered by $80 oil, nobody should rule out the price jumping to $100 and $200 a barrel or maybe double that figure." Saudi Arabia is the world's largest oil exporter

2063 2018-10-16 20:27:33 I don’t agree with Saudi’s politics, but they are the major player in the ME as opposed to Iran. Should we just stop doing oil business - what it really about - drive prices to $150/barrel and trigger a World recession. We screwed up in Africa jumping gun on Libya. S/W repeat?
2064 2018-10-16 20:27:24 You should really push hemp. It can be used so many ways that can save so many trees. Make, paper, cloths, oil, shit honestly I don’t know what else but I know there’s a lot more!
2065 2018-10-16 20:27:16 7% and I’m FINALLY getting an oil change

2066 2018-10-16 20:27:08 Oil Money is great, isnt it?
2067 2018-10-16 20:27:05 Damn it never took this long for an oil change
2068 2018-10-16 20:27:03 You don't have enough banks or oil! Sorry!
2069 2018-10-16 20:26:56 I just bought CBD oil for my anxiety cause I don’t like the idea of putting Lorazepam in my body every day soooooo I’ll let you guys know how it works out
2070 2018-10-16 20:26:55 Pls sir, also do well to investigate the rumoured unremited revenues of oil sales that necessitate its shortfall to non oil revenues for the first time since 1956 when oil was discovered. Indulging in Looting and mouthing I'm fighting corruption is deception.
2071 2018-10-16 20:26:52 I just bought a cool new Poo-Chi robot dog! Scientology is the only true science! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!

2081 2018-10-16 20:25:54 It would turn the sand to glass, then we could see how much oil is left.

2086 2018-10-16 20:24:55 My wife and I scour the ingredients of everything we take from supermarket shelves, and when we see palm oil (or several variations of it) we return the product (Cadbury's, Hovis bread, Mr Kipling cakes, etc) back on the supermarket shelf.  We've halved our weekly food bill.
2087 2018-10-16 20:24:53 Just checked. I don’t think amazon can quite sell cbd oil yet.

2093 2018-10-16 20:24:32 Hey Ladies

I’m very into alternative medicine and herbal remedies so if you are experiencing a yeast infection and have no money or access to OTC medications, you can use plain Greek yogurt and coconut oil to fix your lady parts 
2094 2018-10-16 20:24:07 Oh noooo were you wearing a lacefront??? It won’t grow back tomorrow but get some Jamaican black castor oil, or wild growth oil, or virgin hair fertilizer and use it everyday.
2095 2018-10-16 20:24:04 Saudi Arabia currently produces approximately 0.01 billion barrels of this oil per day, meaning that at the country's present rate of production, its oil should last it roughly just over 73 years. Aug 14, 2017
2096 2018-10-16 20:24:02 Lavender oil / tea, stretching, drinking enough water, moving around / doing light exercise to release some of your excess energy, also breathing exercises where you breathe in for 7 seconds, hold for 5 seconds, exhale for 10 seconds.

2098 2018-10-16 20:23:43 Of course. They’d rather win Texas in most years. Indiana bands have a very big advantage going into Nats. They’ve been in the Oil Can at least twice before Nats. Everyone else was last year, if they got a bid.
2099 2018-10-16 20:23:30 Not unexpected when fools elect an anti oil government.
2100 2018-10-16 20:23:24 ALERT: #ClimateChange Warning falls on Trump’s Desk; He calls his Oil & Coal advisers,"Is climate change real?" THEY remind him it's all a commie-socialist fake-news fake-science UN plot to undermine BIG-Biz & Big-Oil Wealth.
2101 2018-10-16 20:23:16 This is all made up. There is no reason that oil should cost that much... What has changed?
2102 2018-10-16 20:23:09 Commodities typically go up with inflation. Like I said, if commodities hyperinflate so will everything, oil included, so electric cars will still be economical. You can take the pessimistic view, but my advice is that history shows it will not pan out.
2103 2018-10-16 20:23:05 This one's are sharp, as they oil economy dips, invest in the knowledge economy that's taking off
2104 2018-10-16 20:23:00 Two things - weapons sales and oil.

2106 2018-10-16 20:22:59 @realDonaldTrump Since 1950, Saudi Arabia has spent nearly $90 billion on arms from U.S. defense contractors, according to data compiled by the Pentagon. And America has spent 7 trillions because of no control of oil market. Isn't fair.

2113 2018-10-16 20:22:28 Obsessing over money. Many current issues are directly related to downright harmful industries, such as the oil industry and the diamond industry. The former hurts our planet, the latter kills its inhabitants. 

All in the holy name of profit, of course! #globaleng18
2114 2018-10-16 20:22:26 For a while, I was hopeful for BMW but this clean oil, gas, diesel thing is ironic in the name itself!
2115 2018-10-16 20:22:25 That’s a little easier said than done. Since the world wars, the dependency on oil by the US has been substantial. Other crude resources can be depended on but to gradually move dependency is tumultuous. Ex: environmentally conscious energy sources. Its a battle within itself
2116 2018-10-16 20:22:18 When the only solution is MOAR GOVERNMENT!!!!!!!11!!!1!!...
2117 2018-10-16 20:22:15 Pre maithripala is the main obstacle india has at the moment in their mission of signing strategically important  ECTA,and acquiring geopoliticaly assets like Mattala airport,Trinco oil tanks,colombo port terminal .indian can achieve those targets easily as PM becomes d president

2127 2018-10-16 20:21:02 @TuckerCarlson  Isn't it a little too convenient that a Trump-hating Bezos WaPo journalist is the one who disappears right before the midterms? (And of course it involves the Saudis & oil threats)
2128 2018-10-16 20:21:00 I 100% agree with @TruffleGod and it is so great that you can buy real truffle products year around now (butter, salt, oil) #PantryChat #foodies #recipes #cooking
2129 2018-10-16 20:20:42 Opposition MP Dr. Roodal Moonilal sent to Privileges Committee over statements he made about the Prime Minister which relate to a US bank account and the alleged fake oil matter.
2130 2018-10-16 20:20:41 Periodic reminder that peak oil is still a thing; fracking / tar sands boom bought an extra decade or two at best; civilization still based on a rapidly depleting non-renewable resource; there is no current plan B...
2131 2018-10-16 20:20:32 oil and nuclear are far more expensive... and that meat of tomorrow will be insects most likely bc of ppl like you who refuse to see facts... industries die all the time.. so do species. "immediately" its been said for decades! the cheese is bad ( who moved my cheese)
2132 2018-10-16 20:20:23 I see through your ZioNaziCon deception.

#BakkenGate & #IsraelGate is coming for you crooked puppet politician pr residents & your big oil, industrial military complex, banker, supremacist slaver colonizer puppet masters. 

Times up! Your coup de tat pr residency is over.
2133 2018-10-16 20:20:16 I’m gonna experiment with oil paint today, honestly I feel like it’s just gonna smear everywhere and I’m gonna hate it but we’ll never know if I don’t try :—-)
2134 2018-10-16 20:20:12 You simply don’t care about the death of anyone!  This is what your teaching America’s children- that oil, wealth and self preservation is more important than a life...than democracy!
2135 2018-10-16 20:20:06 Wat gone around is komin around knn!
2136 2018-10-16 20:20:06 The FCF numbers are terrible. It’s like a shale oil play in 2014. All great until growth slows and then no way to fund.
2137 2018-10-16 20:20:06 hose em off and baby oil em down
2138 2018-10-16 20:20:03 That it is true that Israel has conspired to bomb Syria for oil? Forgive my ignorance, isn't it Assad and Russia who bombed Syria?
2139 2018-10-16 20:20:02 So that's alright then?  Surly the Crown Prince wouldn't lie to you ? Of course not-and pigs can fly!  But then its US's oil rich friend=not a"shithole"  poor country-so you turn a blind eye-even to murder  Keep kissing the ring-no morality-just greedy self interest Sad person
2140 2018-10-16 20:19:58 We shall see what unfolds...in any case, something is happening in the KSA, and it's once again about oil.
2141 2018-10-16 20:19:57 Smear and FUD is NOT truth... THAT's all this is... been used in the climate arena for decades...oil companies FUND these smear mills...it's cheap for them... just like their buying politians
2142 2018-10-16 20:19:55 No it will vary, I'm hearing that for staples  like mealie meal,cooking oil etc it will be lower. So its meant to target manufacturing and encourage value addition. We wait for full details but ST will be a game changer, right now grz and zra are broke and vat is a headache
2143 2018-10-16 20:19:54 Brush ur teeth with coconut oil
2144 2018-10-16 20:19:54 Agree with the @BatisteHair! I also use a cocoa powder / baby powder mix with a few drops of essential oil for fragrance, but you can skip the oil!
2145 2018-10-16 20:19:48 Wahhabism , an export of house of Saudi is one of the biggest threats to global peace...Riyadh should be shunned and isolated by every self respecting civilization..Sanctions by the US should kick in..but then it has lots of  oil and is the biggest military hardware customer..
2146 2018-10-16 20:19:38 Indomie Relish is just noodles and palm oil. 350 for this???
2147 2018-10-16 20:19:38 If we lived in a decent world every Country in the West would kick out every Saudi diplomat immediately until the truth of what was done to #Khashoggi was revealed and his remains turned over and all those involved handed over to Turkey w immunity removed. But we prefer oil.
2148 2018-10-16 20:19:36 You gotta take out Brent Crude Oil Futures just to hedge your individual petrol cost
2149 2018-10-16 20:19:31 I want people to get hip to his future actions re the disturbance of Iran’s oil production. What brought oil to $50 a barrel and busted the Bush attempt to keep oil high was negotiating with Iran. Trump is acting on requests from the US oil producers to raise the price of crude.
2150 2018-10-16 20:19:27 hello all i have completely changed my routine so i am now selling my cosrx snail mucin essence, cosrx oil free moisturizing lotion, cosrx low ph good morning cleanser, senka perfect whip and tonymoly chokchok watery cream!!!
2151 2018-10-16 20:19:24 Usually, you only buy a quart of oil at a time, so a gallon should last a while. I mean, unless the chainsaw is just burning thru it, which I doubt.

And, yes, I can imagine all of the TWSS statements. :D
2152 2018-10-16 20:19:21 Olive oil play??? I'm all in for some parmigiana play with fried chicken dildos.
2153 2018-10-16 20:19:19 Okro. If you already have Palm oil at home
2154 2018-10-16 20:19:09 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed #TexasDebate
2155 2018-10-16 20:19:05 Need to oil my joints again. I swear, sometimes I feel like the tin man from the wizard of oz =A=
2156 2018-10-16 20:18:59 オイルだからってオイルツイートばかりな訳じゃないぞ。油ツイートもするよ。
2157 2018-10-16 20:18:53 Именно поэтому у меня 4к сохранок, и я не парюсь, ибо все они на флешке.
2158 2018-10-16 20:18:46 step one: get betty crocker brownie mix
step two: get ingredients (usually an egg and water or vegetable oil)
step three: mix together
step four: do not bake. just eat it straight out of the bowl. will you get salmonella? idk, maybe. worth it? idk, maybe
2159 2018-10-16 20:18:43 Really regressive move from @MBIEgovtnz and @Megan_Woods. Granting @omv an extension on their Great South Basin permit is the same as issuing new oil and gas permits. Morally inexcusable in light of last week's @IPCC_CH report.
2160 2018-10-16 20:18:40 I’ll do change your oil for a 12 pack
2161 2018-10-16 20:18:35 I keep losing my Rosehip Oil Lipgloss and I cannot take it anymore  buying 3 backups today.
2162 2018-10-16 20:18:35 Sure they did. All that talk about having video evidence from an apple watch was nonsense also.  Bluetooth wouldn't have made it outside the building.  There are a hundred reasons for the far in America and Europe to frame the Saudi government. The first being Iranian oil.
2163 2018-10-16 20:18:25 If it endangers statues, shouldn't the left want more of it?
2164 2018-10-16 20:18:23 I actually got really great Good Genes results (pre-acne/Accutane skin) but the Luna oil didn’t work for me at all and I agree that Tidal is basically a moisturizer with some glycolic acid mixed in for no reason
2165 2018-10-16 20:18:23 Hot oil && zoooooobieeeeee
2166 2018-10-16 20:18:12 Absolutely. Fuel subsidy must go. Sell the senate to the Chinese. Go from 36 state bureaucracies to 12. Cut MDAs. Sell the presidential fleet. Etc. All that. The problem is revenue sha. Time to face that reality. Oil isn’t enough to fund education & infra adequately
2167 2018-10-16 20:18:08 Saudi trolls are so much thanks to oil money.
2168 2018-10-16 20:18:08 Ausgleich klar. Aber ein schönes Tor.
2169 2018-10-16 20:17:53 Stupid? In denial? In the pocket of big oil and coal? Old men who really don’t give a damn?
2170 2018-10-16 20:17:50 India used to import oil from Iraq under Deffered payment system in 80 s and exported food stuff against payments due in USD .All construction projects were executed under DPA s signed between Exit bank and central bank of Iraq
2171 2018-10-16 20:17:46 Says volumes about the oil too:)
2172 2018-10-16 20:17:33 the article says the animals were sick and infected and the National Parks and Wildlife Service permitted the animals to be culled. No oil filled burrows were found.

Is there any evidence that the animals were not culled humanely?
2173 2018-10-16 20:17:25 Per @SangerNYT, we need KSA to boost production before/after 11/5 if our Iran oil sanctions strategy has any hope of working.
2174 2018-10-16 20:17:22 “! W@nt A d0Dg3 d@Rt” now I’m realizing it only takes synthetic oil so I’m stuck paying $50 for an oil change 
2175 2018-10-16 20:17:05 А потом хочешь их удалить, но понимаешь что это же твое золотце и рука не поднимается, а вдруг я ещё когда-нибудь через сто тысяч лет их захочу посмотреть А ИХ НЕ БУДЕМ М ЧТО ТОГДА?! и поэтому ничего не удаляю
2176 2018-10-16 20:17:00 You just answered the situation yourself, so how do you import when the guarantee is depleted? Ability to pay your bills gone, because oil was selling at $35 per barrel. We couldn’t earn enough $ and had no reserve to service our import bills.
2177 2018-10-16 20:16:54 Right. Just like the 1.1 trillion dollar Iraq war would cost “billion tops” then be funded by their oil sales.
2178 2018-10-16 20:16:53 I need better face paint the one i got is odeeeee oil based I’m not feeling it
2179 2018-10-16 20:16:51 I agree with MSNBC! Why is she focusing on 2020? We need to win these midterms to send a message. Focus on high home heating oil and gas prices.
2180 2018-10-16 20:16:40 
Which essential oil ?
2181 2018-10-16 20:16:40 US Closing prices: #DOW 2.15% #NASDAQ 2.94% #Ftse100 0.43% #GBPUSD 1.3189 #EURGBP 0.8778 #EURUSD 1.1578 #Gold -0.22% #Oil -0.10%
2182 2018-10-16 20:16:28 Ooooof that was too much sesame oil, I feel sick
2183 2018-10-16 20:16:25 Great to join Tullow as they hold their main Board meeting here in Accra.  Their pioneering work in oil & gas highlighted in numbers:

Invested over $16bn in Ghana; paid over $1bn in taxes; gifted free fuel creating 25% of ghana's electricity; $9.5bn
 in local supply chains.
2184 2018-10-16 20:16:15 Good idea. Making money by selling weapons to despots is not tho. Their buying now ties our hands like their oil once did.
2185 2018-10-16 20:16:13 Gotta buy a whole new laptop, passport, mixer, oil paints, Timberlands
2186 2018-10-16 20:16:11 I think XOM is sucking up to Middle East oil countries.
2187 2018-10-16 20:16:10 Bit late to the party here guys. Accept my apologies. A lot of overhead line installations on the bigger scale (compared to the IoM) are inspected using UAVs, offshore oil stacks, wind turbines etc. The UAV sector is growing substantially.
2188 2018-10-16 20:15:59 Just found out that I get free oil changes until my car hit 42k miles 
2189 2018-10-16 20:15:58 I hope this movie will focus on Ed's oil painting techniques.
2190 2018-10-16 20:15:57 No we don't want to rely on Putin, we want to rely on our own wind and sun and tide. We have plenty right here. Oil and gas is the past, its time to move on to renewables.
2191 2018-10-16 20:15:42 GB isn't just propping up SA, and similarly this is a lot of my frustration over how labour and the broader western left handles Israel, lack of accountability.

GB put the house of Saud in power, western oil money empowers them but they actively project western power.
2192 2018-10-16 20:15:31 To hell with @VP and @realDonaldTrump they are not scientists.they do whatever the oil lobby wants.
2193 2018-10-16 20:15:31 You need the money for oil rig anaa?
2194 2018-10-16 20:15:14 Thank God for my job I get my alignment,tires rotated,oil changed without me having to do anything

Особенно, когда смотришь то, что ты раньше сохраняла. Тупо седишь такой с лицом лица и немым вопросом "Что блять? Кто это вообще сохраняет?" А потом до тебя доходит, что это твои сохры, и ты такой: "Е6ать, я"
2196 2018-10-16 20:15:09 Not really surprised after MSM has spent past 2 weeks lionizing Khashoggi who was well known supporter of those Islamic Jihadis, who cut off Journo's Heads.

2200 2018-10-16 20:14:51 However, new data links these oils with many serious diseases, including heart disease and cancer (21, 22, 23).

Avoid all of them:

Soybean oil
Corn oil
Cottonseed oil
Canola oil
Rapeseed oil
Sunflower oil
Sesame oil
Grapeseed oil
Safflower oil
Rice bran oil

2204 2018-10-16 20:14:23 I disagree.  This is the oil industry lying about measure G, ad putting their  profits above public health.  Vote Yes.

Coconut oil 
Whipped cream

2207 2018-10-16 20:14:02 Trump: to give it to his rich friends. Like Saudi Arabia who recently a journalist disappeared and presumed murder. But trump does not believe the reports from journalist since he likes pseudo journAlism - Fox News. I don’t need a PHD to Not Buy Snake oil from a conman trump
2208 2018-10-16 20:14:00 It will be about 3 seconds after the last drop of oil is pumped.
2209 2018-10-16 20:13:58 Friends, middle America, rural America, common folk, no-BSs, How can you vote for these 'reps' who give away our clean air & water, and who oppose The Needed Energy Changes from climate changing carbon-emissions. 
We need MORE REGULATIONS on the Greedy Oil Industries, Not less!
2210 2018-10-16 20:13:57 You seem to like blaming it on the past government but fail to mention during that period the US imported record high amounts of oil at +$100/bbl. It's only recently the US has become more independent
2211 2018-10-16 20:13:39 There are no more oil or coal fired power stations in Scotland.  The last, Longannet was closed a couple of years ago.
2212 2018-10-16 20:13:33 .@EPAAWheeler The power industry, which includes coal and oil burning power plants, has invested $18 billion in cleaning up dangerous pollutants, and overturning the Mercury &amp; Air Toxic Standards would be disastrous. Protect our environment and invest in our future!

2214 2018-10-16 20:13:30 Simplest is: toss octopus and conch meat w/a bit of crunchy celery and celery leaves & red onion, then a lashing of fruity olive oil & a bit of acid:lemon/lime juice or Sherry vinegar (tho I sometimes use a bit of banana pepper juice, which I also sometimes add. Hungry now.
2215 2018-10-16 20:13:27 All seriousness.. I just been seeing oil spill

2217 2018-10-16 20:13:17 So you are asking WWE not to do business there, but don't mind buying their oil? Seems like hypocrisy to me
2218 2018-10-16 20:13:16 Germany has a Very Good Solar Energy System in place along the Roadways.
Leave it alone.
If the US HAD the Same Policy...
There wouldn't be a Need for Oil.
2219 2018-10-16 20:12:58 idk mom my day was pretty normal, missed class bc of my dumb dog, went to anatomy, started mass hysteria on Facebook durning my oil change, came home.
2220 2018-10-16 20:12:54 I'm a physician w decades of medical practice. Chemotx is hoax; docs who "enroll" patients in treatment make LOTS $ every patient.

2221 2018-10-16 20:12:53 Saudi Arabia has historically been a violent dictatorship. The oil wells are rigged to blow in case the government is ever overthrown. Who does that?
2222 2018-10-16 20:12:52 The obscene fossil fuel industry is poisoning the whole world and threatening the human species.

2231 2018-10-16 20:12:06 We’re done with the snake oil lawyer politicians that say lots and do nothing. Want some more of that? Clinton looks ready for another go. There’s Kamala and Spartacus and Uncle Joe - makes no difference who you vote for all the same.
2232 2018-10-16 20:12:03 totally - when people say this to me my response is generally to ask incredulously “Have you been on the Internet?”. [See also TV advertising of all manner of snake oil]
2233 2018-10-16 20:11:58 We have it and more. We have been extracting, condensing and manufacturing with cannabis for almost 3 years now.

2234 2018-10-16 20:11:58 These things may help: 
Something delicious but easy to eat.

A face mask/scrub/cry in the bath or shower

Muscle relaxant oil or salve.
And, start over. #selfcare

2237 2018-10-16 20:11:45 Wonder how much "honey" and "olive oil" had he consumed before this incident. He has always been a self promoting, narcissist who likes to shout & quote wrong Hadees, Ayyats & poetry to impress less educated.

2242 2018-10-16 20:11:07 Simply they have oil and money. And yet some middle Eastern countries blame the west. For its woes, and when things goes tits up they then blame the west for not responding, when the shit hits the fan. A bit of a merry go round.
2243 2018-10-16 20:11:05 I had someone commission an oil painting that would take over $500 for me to produce alone... but they don’t want to pay me my rates...

2246 2018-10-16 20:10:50 Saudi's have threatened to use oil as a weapon. Understood, however we will need to rely on other sources and not have that gun to our head all the time.
2247 2018-10-16 20:10:50 Add oil!!!
2248 2018-10-16 20:10:41 Ого, как много. Но я определённо вижу здесь бнха, тёмного дворецкого, Волчонка и титанов. И вроде бы Гинтаму и Дигру. На остальном просто потерялась.

2255 2018-10-16 20:09:56   sugar? I made rice with palm oil, onion, maggi and crayfish. It still is one of the most delicious things I've ever tasted in my life. I was that hungry   
2256 2018-10-16 20:09:55 Long lasting is the key thing that classifies a car as good or bad with little maintenance from. I’m going on a year w my car, and it came w miles on it and I haven’t had to do anything but get oil changes. It’s ppl in my fam that has had Nissan since the 90s GREAT CAR!

2260 2018-10-16 20:09:21 The buy-the-dip crowd took the mkt by storm today after last week's slump. Dow ends +547, +2.2% to 25,798.

S&P +2.2%, Nasdaq +2.9%, Russell 2000 +2.9%.

Q3 earnings reports bolstered the bullish case. Also helping: oil, bond yields and the dollar held steady.

2277 2018-10-16 20:07:03 On this day 45 years ago, Oct 16, 1973, the Arab members of OPEC agreed to cut oil production by 10% with a further 5% reduction each month at protest for US and EU support for Israel.

2290 2018-10-16 20:05:42 They control most of the oil so this Administration isn’t going to hold them accountable and find an excuse.
2291 2018-10-16 20:05:41 Huge oil reserves controlled by one family puted in power by the British Empire. That's not democracy, that's INTEREST.
2292 2018-10-16 20:05:29 #TransMountainpipeline and #NorthernGateway would have the same effects along with helping all Cdn’s with the revenue they would create which is currently being given to the US as we sell them our oil at a discount.

2312 2018-10-16 20:03:50 Yes, there was coal but not significant. Off-shore oil at the end of 1960's

2320 2018-10-16 20:02:50 We can now that we have returned to be the largest producer of oil in the world. It probably would hurt some of our allies,  when they raise the price of a barrel to $200
2321 2018-10-16 20:02:48 I. :) . Think rates are still extremely favorable feeding speculation. Inflation will come, and when it comes it will come faster than if rates were higher already. USD is vulnerable. Oil has not priced in political risk. etc etc

2329 2018-10-16 20:01:58 So @MaryBonoUSA says the reason she blacked out her bike golf shoes is because she doesn't believe "sacrificing everything" applies to people being shot dead in the street by police. But it applies to soldiers fighting for oil in a sham war.

2333 2018-10-16 20:01:37 I do too. And it smells like palo santo smoke and rose/jasmine oil blend. Life is pretty fucking awesome. 
2334 2018-10-16 20:01:35 Coworker constantly uses frankincense essential oil. Smells like a Catholic Church at Christmas. And gives me a headache. Probably because I smelled it too often during my Catholic school years.

2338 2018-10-16 20:01:07 The government of Nicaragua has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Joe Francis in a ghalamkar wig.
2339 2018-10-16 20:01:07 Maybe good to remember that few other countries have oil as well?

But oil security is supreme because oil markets is a source of security in itself.

2361 2018-10-16 19:59:18 So it’s common knowledge that the growth in the Nigerian economy is positively correlated to the price of Oil. What would be interesting to know is what sectors of the Nigerian economy exhibit growth that’s negatively correlated to the oil price. Any one with some insight?
2362 2018-10-16 19:59:11 Bush/Cheney gathered up every member of the Saudi Royal Family within hours after 9/11 and flew them all home in one of the only aircraft allowed to fly on that horrible day. Why has this never been explained? Was this actually an act of war & we secretly surrendered? Is it OIL?

2394 2018-10-16 19:56:10 "Moderation" is the favorite term of soft drink makers, grain pushers, junk food chains, etc. Means "Eat our shit, just not enough to kill you quickly." Never listen to anyone who urges dietary moderation. Eat quality meat, and ZERO grain, sugar or seed oil. NOT DIFFICULT.

2403 2018-10-16 19:55:19 Yes ~ If using products that are plastic-free, made from biodegradable material ~ cotton & plant cellulose ~ it is possible to compost them ~ they are expensive comparatively to the traditional crude oil counterparts & they still don't belong in the rubbish.
2404 2018-10-16 19:55:07 Yes, more corruption, more divisiveness, more moves towards fascism, more alienation of allies, more subjugation towards dictatorships, more destruction of our environment, more sell off of public lands to oil and mining groups, more side deals making his family richer...

2418 2018-10-16 19:53:46 if you don't want to tax drivers fine, then the oil companies, car companies, or any automotive companies that profit from the use of our infrastucture need to bear the cost, but conservatives don't like making corporations pay for the impact they cause, now do they?
2419 2018-10-16 19:53:46 ... strong inter-provincial migration       has contributed to demand, especially following collapse of oil prices brought Albertans starting in 2015, along with foreign immigration #vanRE ...
2420 2018-10-16 19:53:39 Tell them the truth. Cooking oil is now being sold at the tills to avoid hoarding. Witnessedit it at Pick n Pay Borrowdale
2421 2018-10-16 19:53:26 Oil change
2422 2018-10-16 19:53:20 "Oil is an interesting strategy, quite honestly. "
2423 2018-10-16 19:53:18 Looking for a #vegan substitute for fish oil....suggestions welcomed @TheVeganSociety
2424 2018-10-16 19:53:17 Ate lunch, washed my car, got an oil change.

I'm exhausted
2425 2018-10-16 19:53:13 Under Trump it has become clear Washington has launched a new war on competitors. Target is oil producing countries who are not poodles of Washington. America wants to become the hegemon supplier of oil and gas in the world. If that includes stealing Gulf oil? No problem.
2426 2018-10-16 19:53:01 I think the lens of oil is also too myopic. It's a *huge* part of it, but KSA is geographically important (close to Israel, Iran, Syria, Hezb, Iraq, etc), ideologically important (holds two of the holiest sites in Islam) and, ofc, resource important.
2427 2018-10-16 19:53:00 2/ By the same way people who believe that Musk, creator of EV revolution, saves the planet will eat alive everyone who suppose that Tesla’s attempt to sell “L5 full self-driving” hardware isn’t a normal business practice, but rather a kind of snake oil salesman’s tips & tricks
2428 2018-10-16 19:52:53 Also great for pasta with chili and anchovies and lots of olive oil
2429 2018-10-16 19:52:53 ah, yes 
infamous keto coffee
coffee, butter, coconut oil, collagen
it's supposed to speed up metabolism and mald you lose weight faster 
never tried it tho
2430 2018-10-16 19:52:52 Use a little coconut oil and rub the glued strip so it loosens then remove/ use a cotton pad with makeup remover in the same way
2431 2018-10-16 19:52:51 You would be best with CBD oil which is basically the medical benefits of pot without the high.
2432 2018-10-16 19:52:49 I think everyone was caught off guard with this one. What can they do? It could be time to release our oil reserve and hit Saudi Arabia with some tough sanctions. But that would put Russia, and Iraq in a stronger position. It's a bad situation all around.

Apply the oil to your lashes and brows before bed.
2435 2018-10-16 19:52:13 Any consideration being given to the destruction of rainforests by Wilmar, your palm oil supplier?
2436 2018-10-16 19:52:09 You forgot to mention that he bought some jet fuel that was made with Saudi oil.
2437 2018-10-16 19:51:52 Or pointing out possible peak intelligence in the masses?
2438 2018-10-16 19:51:49 Saudi Arabia  had relationship with USA since World War 2! Imagine Nazi Germany had gotten Saudi oil fields instead USA! No Israel No Marshall Plan! No VE Day!
2439 2018-10-16 19:51:40 so Timmy is the starting sf? Fiz straight up said Lee and Chuckaway Jr were too small to play sf. Somebody find me the tweet. So fiz is a liar. 

I’m telling ya’ll. Snake oil.
2440 2018-10-16 19:51:31 Obviously McConnell doesn’t understand what the FICA tax is for. He thinks is for Corp welfare that they pass out as subsidies for big oil and Corp jets.
2441 2018-10-16 19:51:27 And to now take the oil (charter) out of the engine that got us through the 2008 crisis? Endless debate to create problems for the proven 80 year, liquidity providing, cross subsidizing, interest rate reducing, affordability providing solution. Recapitalize Regulate Rehabilitate!

2444 2018-10-16 19:51:16 Who cares?  We trade with China who commit human atrocities everyday.  Listen to what the prince says and go with it.  We need the alliance, arms sales and oil.  If one journalist died, who cares.  Journalists are slightly above whale crap.
2445 2018-10-16 19:51:06 Olive oil for the bedroom. . . Interesting.
2446 2018-10-16 19:51:02 The oil isn't going to run out and don't forget the amount of weapons the UK and USA sell them.... They are the main financial backers of ISIS and yet again the UK and USA are up to their nut sacks in sponsoring the terrorists in the middle East...
2447 2018-10-16 19:50:59 Venezuela is not a good example. Venezuela is the way it is because they put all of their resources in oil, and after Hugo Chavez died his predecessor had no clue what to do. Oil prices stayed low so the Venezuelan economy crashed and crashed hard.
2448 2018-10-16 19:50:55 @sullivanradio we need Saudi Arabia for stability in the Middle East not just for the oil
2449 2018-10-16 19:50:52 LADIES y'all need to step up your game in 2019, you have the rest of 2K18 to appreciate the few niggas that do right by women or you are FUCKING CANCELLED 

Y'all need to start paying for hair cuts, manicures, oil changes, put gas in ya nigga car, paying for meals, SOMETHING 
2450 2018-10-16 19:50:48 if you put vaseline and baby oil, you won’t get ashy
2451 2018-10-16 19:50:40 Back when I pitched I used vegetable oil on my wrist and finger tips for the extra added challenge
2452 2018-10-16 19:50:31 Cos they got away with bullying Canada. They have a get out of jail free card because of oil.
2453 2018-10-16 19:50:29 It's almost like Gerard Bulter doesn't have to consider complex factors like geopolitics, the oil markets, and iran
2454 2018-10-16 19:50:28 Any adventure against Saudi Arabia will lead to a huge spike in oil prices.
2455 2018-10-16 19:50:24 That's too much for a conventional oil change, but a bit more reasonable for synthetic. Unless you had other work done too. If you have a receipt or something it might say on there.
2456 2018-10-16 19:50:18 Indeed. Even if Saudis raise prices we need to make a stand at some point. We may have to slap oil companies to make sure our needs first.
2457 2018-10-16 19:50:16 Does asking an italian person if they take shots of olive oil constitute as racism?
2458 2018-10-16 19:50:06 But totally believable.
2459 2018-10-16 19:50:03 Take CBD oil 50/50 THC
2460 2018-10-16 19:49:50 have fun being conned by a snake oil salesman who was paid to coach up his guy and Carr is worse lol
I expected the D to suck .. but the offense scored an average of 6.5 points last 2 games
2461 2018-10-16 19:49:46 I wish I had someone to go take my car to get an oil change  I don’t feel like it
2462 2018-10-16 19:49:34 Medicated Goo by Traffic might be about hucksters selling hokey snake oil depression cures, but paradoxically it's also infectiously upbeat.
2463 2018-10-16 19:49:32 Yes. The basis of US-Saudi relationship is oil - or more precisely, the KSA's role in determining the price of oil. In return, the US provides security. And the best way to guarantee that security is to ensure the stability of the monarchy & fulfill KSA's regional interests.
2464 2018-10-16 19:49:27 If you live in a dessert, expect droughts.
2465 2018-10-16 19:49:22 i’ve been eating mcdonald’s everyday cuz when i’m sad and i eat good when im sad sO im just blessed for my skin care, if i didn’t have it i would look like a ball of oil.
2466 2018-10-16 19:49:19 No gas, it's oil. But you're right, I need to know the size of the problem.
2467 2018-10-16 19:49:14 Count me in too. I'll make an oil gun that squirts oil out so they slip over when they walk on it.

2469 2018-10-16 19:49:09 my mom put anointing oil on a bunch of my things when I was downstairs watching tv so now my computer smells like prayer and it’s not great
2470 2018-10-16 19:49:02 Yeah, yeah, yeah.Big Oil, whatever.  But, what about boofing? Did we ever get to the bottom of this important yearbook entry? Go get 'em tiger!

2472 2018-10-16 19:48:50 Saudi Arabia is an oil company owned by 20,000 cousins
2473 2018-10-16 19:48:37 We do indeed have our own oil!!    With massive reserves!!

But American is definitely NOT "trump country"!  Do you not see how he is in bed with the Saudis???  
2474 2018-10-16 19:48:36 I need to know where i can purchase topical cannabis oil for pain relief..

I don't want to get high.. just topical pain relief to my chronic migraines.

Tell me Toronto ppl~

Help a chronic pain sufferer out. I'm crying and useless every day. I'm so frustrated.
2475 2018-10-16 19:48:33 I love Wrestling. I’ve been a life-long fan.

That being said, would I buy myself  a new Wrestling company? No. Oil have no business doing that.

Buy one that already exists? No. I’m not Dixie.

Invest in one that seems to have its act together? Absolutely.
2476 2018-10-16 19:48:28 I doubt though that they can completely do away with oil
2477 2018-10-16 19:48:26 Wow I’m getting offers from chocolate to oil change on here... how’s about a formal dress for my work party? Any takers?
2478 2018-10-16 19:48:14 Recycling and re-use of oil field produced water is a good thing.  We support the EPA initiative to evaluate the  regulatory approaches to managing  wastewater from oil and gas production facilities. It’s called good government.
2479 2018-10-16 19:48:13 Okayyyy I can't give full verdict because I'm just using it for the first time, but it smells sooo fuckin good, and it really tightened my pores and got rid of oil, plus the packaging, the packaging...boyyyy. It kinda really dried up my skin though.
2480 2018-10-16 19:48:07 or the fact that it will take away jobs. Lol. All of my white neighbors are against 112. Surprise: they all work in oil/gas.
2481 2018-10-16 19:48:07 So I’m getting an oil change and my car is done outside. Both people are sitting at the desk haven’t said it’s done yet. Do I start to complain?
2482 2018-10-16 19:47:41 I have been using AND oil for 2 months. Stopped taking 3 medications and feeling great!
2483 2018-10-16 19:47:37 So if CBD oil doesn’t get you high what is the point lol
2484 2018-10-16 19:47:29 Bernie should advise Vermonters to not use Evil oil to heat their homes this winter.
2485 2018-10-16 19:47:20 "Olive oil... Huh. Now, if only the Greeks used something with a more pleasant scent than that for their bedroom misadventures."
2486 2018-10-16 19:47:11 Would it be plausible that Saudi Arabia sent us a message via 9/11 that they own us and that Oil is King for the next 100 years? Maybe @DickCheney99 has the answers.
2487 2018-10-16 19:47:08 Check your Engine oil this weekend.
2488 2018-10-16 19:47:02 Blue for Texas. Our Senators hated Trump until elected, know they eat mushrooms. Big oil yes, people no. Fracking, ask those with cracked homes, is now good for big oil. Misleading ads, lies. Must retire by 66 in government. Old thinking slow thinking VOTE or leave!

2491 2018-10-16 19:46:52 My dad used to fry it in olive oil in a pan after cutting it up into little pieces.
2492 2018-10-16 19:46:52 Trim the tips every 3-6 months.. Castor oil, coconut oil and Aloe vera treatments also help
2493 2018-10-16 19:46:39 Oh sorry - deer or rodent deaths makes food vegan because they aren't keystone species & it's unavoidable but palm oil is not vegan because it puts orangutans at risk & they are more important as a species.
2494 2018-10-16 19:46:25 Talk to Barack.  When he gets those hundreds of millions back from the terrorist state of Iran, you'll get your money back.  Selling out the U.S. to secure oil for Rockefeller's French oil company while giving money to fund terrorism.  Big no-no.
2495 2018-10-16 19:46:17 The US is pot committed to #SaudiArabia.  We traded the #GoldStandard for the oil standard.  It’s how our currency is as powerful as it is.  Saudi & others agreed to buy oil with US dolla dolla bills yall.  If Saudi stops doing that, it will hurt our economy. #Kashhoggi
2496 2018-10-16 19:46:12 YES!!! IT IS!!! The RADICAL RIGHT has nothing to offer, besides cheap branding and snake oil marketing. @DNC needs to do the same. RADICALS, CON MAN, LIAR!!! Over, and over, and over. Emphasize MANY Trump failures, not hard to find. Folks don’t want to think!!!
2497 2018-10-16 19:46:08 Not as much pressure as "they" would have us believe.China is the leading importer of Saudi oil,America sells arms to MBS and this in turn creates jobs for Trump's administration.I give this story a week and it dies.
2498 2018-10-16 19:46:02 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed #TexasDebate
2499 2018-10-16 19:46:01 You could roast it, then blend with garlic and olive oil for a spread though eh?
2500 2018-10-16 19:45:53 That's the Collusion....Saudis will talk to continue to unload Oil and buy up our Real Estate...#MuellerTime
2501 2018-10-16 19:45:49 Very good Mr POTUS. Heard word that he deep state may be at play here, trying to stir up a war with Saydi Arabia, jacking oil price over $200 and bringing down the economy, which will fuel the Dems bod for 2020.
2502 2018-10-16 19:45:47 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
2503 2018-10-16 19:45:43 Cbd oil is no joke
2504 2018-10-16 19:45:40 There is a whole world of sustainable business opportunities outside of the sunset oil / gas industry. Governments must mandate the transition. Alberta has huge geothermal potential. They also have a strong tech sector too. Courts are beginning to rule on this duty of care.
2505 2018-10-16 19:45:39 I will be watching #theconners with the same enthusiasm I have while waiting for an oil change
2506 2018-10-16 19:45:28 What’s ironic was thinking @GOP believed any part of what they said about tax cuts paying for themselves. Why do people listen to snake oil merchants?
2507 2018-10-16 19:45:12 Has anyone thought what the Saudis might resort to when the oil & therefore cash runs out? What do we think they’ll do with all the weaponry we’ve sold them?
2508 2018-10-16 19:45:08 If you’re not using Grapeseed Oil already, I highly suggest buying a bottle
2509 2018-10-16 19:45:06 Americans don't want aggression against Saudi Arabia or Iran.  Where did you get that idea?

We can have a wonderful, peaceful coexistence without depending on Middle East oil.  
2510 2018-10-16 19:45:03 Saudi Arabia has never been a US ally let alone a friend.They spread terrorism all around the world by funding wahhabism. I remember 9/11.We dont need they're oil.
2511 2018-10-16 19:45:01 I had a urinary tract infection yesterday. I took about 20 drops of Holy oil and it was gone. What else is Big Pharma lying about? #BigPharma #CannabisLegalization #curedisease #hempheals
2512 2018-10-16 19:44:59 You're right. This one has me buffaloed. 
But then, so did Jeff Flake for a second!
Until I found his oil well drilling interests.
2513 2018-10-16 19:44:51 It's the way with all Marxist, autocratic and dictatorial regimes. For thee, but not for me or my family. 
The valid question is, do they really appreciate the benefits of living in a free society or simply see it as fertile ground for further conquest?
2514 2018-10-16 19:44:50 Because they pump muslims oil.
2515 2018-10-16 19:44:44 I'd call Ibuprofen a drug and CBD oil a natural remedy 
2516 2018-10-16 19:44:40 Crude oil
2517 2018-10-16 19:44:37 She sounds congested I know she need a oil change
2518 2018-10-16 19:44:34 Started added a little coconut oil (love the smell), but now I'm going raaaaaaaaw
2519 2018-10-16 19:44:27 Lies !!!!!  You are the opposite of a conservationist.
You are owned by big oil corp lobbyists
You are arrogant & not a geologist
2520 2018-10-16 19:44:27 Saudi Arabia is a backwards, fantasy believing plot of sand. Unfortunately, they sit upon oil & we refuse to put our minds to seeking alternative fuels.
2521 2018-10-16 19:44:26 Sure, and there are instances when I do. But I hope that by frank and open discussion I can help educate those who are being mislead by buzzword bingo and snake oil salesmen.
2522 2018-10-16 19:44:19 Got to wonder why they called you in the first place. Like oil and water.
2523 2018-10-16 19:44:15 Hey at what point does @exxonmobil mutilate their genitalia? Cuz I need to know if I should but Exon gas and oil based on when you decided to support Sharia Law and cutting off clitorises.
2524 2018-10-16 19:44:10 When I become President, I plan to put a Thomas Kincade tribute artist's original oil of me, Hillary Clinton, Kamala Harris, Eleanor Roosevelt, Gary Hart and George Soros surfing up in the Oval.
2525 2018-10-16 19:44:00 Things I’d buy: A jacket that feels like someone is hugging you. 

A container that allows crispy/fried food to not get soggy. 

A frying machine that can easily change the size of the frying vat so you don’t waste a ton of oil. 

Heels that feel like sneakers, but look normal.
2526 2018-10-16 19:43:58 Can we import oil from Canada. Do we really need the Saudis so much...? I mean these people are fucking barbaric.
2527 2018-10-16 19:43:53 idk if peppermint essential oil actually *cures* nausea but the burning sensation is a nice distraction, i can tell you that much
2528 2018-10-16 19:43:51 You have been brainwashed and manipulated by big oil companies and their political puppets. Taking advantage of your unfounded paranoia and Ignorance to make themselves rich while the whole world pays for it.
2529 2018-10-16 19:43:47 Rogue nation murdered an American resident and journalist. Is oil that important?
2530 2018-10-16 19:43:45 The Witcher:
It was a calm day in Kaer Morhen. Vesemir was teaching new recruits about  White Wolfs. 'Use  Beast Oil against them', he said, 'It'll make your jobs easier'.
2531 2018-10-16 19:43:40 Peppermint oil to save the day!
2532 2018-10-16 19:43:24 "Okay so we agree, you don't accuse us of torturing, murdering and dismembering journalist and we keep giving you oil.  Good deal?  Hahahahahahahahah!"
2533 2018-10-16 19:43:08 Que sad fumar tanto oil que te siento que ya es jamming jajaja 
2534 2018-10-16 19:43:07 Why we buy from liars while there are respected countries offer the right alternative and respect their allies, why sell oil to those who do not deserve
2535 2018-10-16 19:43:03 This our keeper dey spill ball like oil spillage.
2536 2018-10-16 19:43:00 Let's get this straight. You're offended by someone vandalizing this sign, but not offended by the idea of polluting the Big Hole and Beaverhead, two blue-ribbon rivers in your homestate that you want to open to fracking and oil and gas development? #mtpol
2537 2018-10-16 19:42:52 Why d super eagles official allow uzoho to adin agbon oil to rob his body heennn ball just droping in his hand
2538 2018-10-16 19:42:51 Go ahead!  Shale oil production has increased in the USA and Canada, we're only getting 9% of our oil from you anyway.  

trump looks weak, no wonder the Saudis are taking advantage of Americans.
2539 2018-10-16 19:42:25 ...add a bath wash with tea tree oil next time...whole new discovery..lol.
2540 2018-10-16 19:42:25 This is all bullshit. You are running for cover. It's all about protecting your power and influence. You can't afford to have oil at $400 a barrell and the Saudis likely have dirt on you like the Russians. There is no way you let the murder of a reporter jeopardize this
2541 2018-10-16 19:42:24 Combine Saudi thieves with our feckless politicians, the American people are fed up giving them our money. I hope our President, DONALD J TRUMP cuts off the flow of oil from those bastards. Tell them to drink their oil, we don’t need or want it anymore.
2542 2018-10-16 19:42:20 Getting my oil changed and they have hot chocolate here! I’m so happy :o)
2543 2018-10-16 19:42:20 Would you please start talking more about the RADICAL RIGHT and it’s CON MAN MESSIAH? They have nothing to offer America, besides cheap branding and snake oil marketing. Brand them, brand them basically, and brand them often. Tell your colleagues to do the same!!!
2544 2018-10-16 19:42:19 Really? This is the worst since 911? Why are the media using this to stir up $hit? Has something to do with how he is acting with oil...? It is the only time the press calls people Dictators and Authoritarians? Well except Trump and Brexit!
2545 2018-10-16 19:42:06 All jokes aside rubbing THC oil into my beard made it grow quickkkkk
2546 2018-10-16 19:42:04 Yes na The OGEDE OIL SECTOR DEY BOOM 
2547 2018-10-16 19:41:58 Hi Hamad, it might not impact short-term as much given the oil support with production and prices higher. Yet, on the medium-term it might weigh on the appetite of international investors whether foreign direct investment or portfolio inflows. We need crisis management ASAP!
2548 2018-10-16 19:41:58 Haaa OK supermarket  kutengesa 750 ml cooking oil $2,25 mm
2549 2018-10-16 19:41:45 That's like saying 'I'll stop dropping my litter on the floor when big companies stop dumping oil'.
2550 2018-10-16 19:41:42 You get tha big oil refineries and corporations are owned by Republicans right?
2551 2018-10-16 19:41:37 What is happening to Uzoho. Spilling like crude oil. #LIBNGA
2552 2018-10-16 19:41:35 I'm not a BOT. I am a born and bred U.S. citizen. We import oil from 5 countries. The US doesn't have to have Saudi oil to survive. I remember the OPEC squeeze.
2553 2018-10-16 19:41:29 Well I am ashamed of the Cherokee elders to doubt Warren's background. These same elders have disowned blacks because they did not want to share oil revenue. Old people most times are corrupt..
2554 2018-10-16 19:41:25 And big oil money is the reason the fascist lie its about climate change they push that it does not exist! Just ask Reagan??
2555 2018-10-16 19:41:22 When @wintersxoxo_ splits an Olive Oil sandwich with you because we’re both broke college students ://
2556 2018-10-16 19:41:14 #2018Midterms are about #RenewableEnergyResources NOT #Coal NOT #Oil NOT #Fracking NOT #CoalWasteDumping
2557 2018-10-16 19:41:12 Government and law are weird;

If any treasure or Oil is found in the backyard of your house. 
That belongs to the government.
And
If weapons/drugs/dead bodies are found, then they belong to you.
2558 2018-10-16 19:41:09 Or, consider that according to the UNICEF-Saddam government report, the infant mortality rate allegedly was 98 deaths per 1,000 in 1995 while, three years later, it was 103 deaths per thousand. This would mean that as the U.N. relieved sanctions via the oil-for-food program,
2559 2018-10-16 19:40:55 I actually need to do better but I’d say if you have dry skin/hair like me, keep your hair moisturized. Olive oil + tea tree oil + Shea butter are great. Try to protect your hair from rubbing on clothings and scarves.
2560 2018-10-16 19:40:52 Might fuck around and get addicted to cbd oil
2561 2018-10-16 19:40:48 Does anyone want to stay with me while I get an oil change? I’m in Salinas :(
2562 2018-10-16 19:40:45 Continuation of last post... most of the oil used in this country come from Aramco with headquarters in Texas and Riyadh K.S.A. and know by Saudi Aramco one of the largest company's in the world. But again there are many countries like India where they have a class based society
2563 2018-10-16 19:40:29 If I could work at a job where I don't get grease and oil burns that'd be tight as hell
2564 2018-10-16 19:40:16 The devil wants me to pour hot oil on my legs this night 

I told him my name isn't Stephen
2565 2018-10-16 19:40:11 二重顎っていうか逆に顎がないよ。
2566 2018-10-16 19:40:06 Family Nutrition: #Lays Smooth #Ranch Dip this October? Top four ingredients are water, oil, modified tapioca and corn starch.
2567 2018-10-16 19:40:00 Wouldn't this also remove any cast iron seasoning burying off the oil?
2568 2018-10-16 19:39:42 tea tree oil vocês .. faz wounds e bacterial infections sumirem em 2 tempos.. acho até muito mais eficaz que bio oil, nas cicatrizes .. useeem
2569 2018-10-16 19:39:16 Get onboard HUR. First oil within 6 months and excellent farm in agreed with Spirit. Potential reserves huge.
2570 2018-10-16 19:39:10 Trump’s trys to bully and threaten Iran economic growth which is oil and Iran double down on weak ass president Donald Trump bully threats
2571 2018-10-16 19:39:04 on a more positive note, I just spoke to my dad and he bought me lentils, haricot beans, olive oil and argan oil back from Morocco so I already know it's going to be fresh and he's bringing them with him to Exeter when he comes to visit me this weekend
2572 2018-10-16 19:38:55 $40 oil #dennisgartman baaahahahahahahah!!!! #foxbusiness
2573 2018-10-16 19:38:55 Cocoa!

2.5x flour / 1.5x sugar / 4 whole eggs / 1x oatmeal milk / 0.5x cocoa powder / 1x oil (olive this time around) / 10 chopped almonds / 16g vanilla-flavoured baking powder!

180°C for about 25 mins (in my moody oven, at least)

Unit of measurement: a glass!
2574 2018-10-16 19:38:51 Where do you think the money is coming from. Okay why don't you tell all Nigerians to go and collect Money from their bank to buy from fort oil so we all have light. They won't give u. Go collect from ren money. That double you're crying about you will pay it in 9 months.
2575 2018-10-16 19:38:44 This is a shocking story.

#skpoli govt is more interested in the money it receives from the oil industry than it is in doing its JOB to warn citizens and take measures to protect public health.

Terrible.  #cdnpoli #cdnhealth
2576 2018-10-16 19:38:38 All this is really about efforts by the Left to spike oil prices and influence relationships in the Middle East. Otherwise an incident easily handled by the Turkish police.
2577 2018-10-16 19:38:32 لا انت لا تطلب شوربة و نودلز اطلب النودلز اللي بتيجي بدون السوربة و العجقة بس بكون عليها خضار و هاد الsesame oil و لحمة مقطعة هيك رفيع او جاج لحمة افضل بس
2578 2018-10-16 19:38:08 Mmm, can't wait to get home and eat 4 whole slices of tomato that are covered in so much oil they'll slide right out the other end.
2579 2018-10-16 19:37:54 Ok that is all we need, a kings denial is good as a barrel of oil.  Tell me again how many Saudi Arabian terrorist where responsible for the WTC attack?
2580 2018-10-16 19:37:44 We have the strongest military in the world we don’t have to please anybody because they spend money With us if they don’t want to do business with us send our boys over there and take their oil money and gold and tell Israel to stay in it’s fucking place We run shit not them
2581 2018-10-16 19:37:41 @LindseyGrahamSC You better tread carefully with the Saudis. In care you haven’t noticed. EVERY major recession since WW2 has been triggered by some kind of energy crisis. Nixon told them to “drink their oil” and we had the 73 oil embargo
2582 2018-10-16 19:37:24 Castor oil is the best thing invented
2583 2018-10-16 19:37:22 US corporations extract a lot of $$ from the world now. Google/Facebook/Twitter/Amazon ... they run mostly on non US eyeballs. But the revenues go to US economy. The US military power protects energy supplies and get Oil basically for free. And the $ they "pay" stay in US banks.
2584 2018-10-16 19:37:10 Do I get an oil change or just sell my car and buy a new one
2585 2018-10-16 19:36:58 But but Oil and Petrodollars and arms deal.
2586 2018-10-16 19:36:58 Almost all vegetable oils become toxic and can cause cancer if used for high heat cooking. Use ghee or coconut oil or palm oil for tadka, deep-frying and for shallow frying dry spices. @fssaiindia
2587 2018-10-16 19:36:55 Saudi Arabia...
What is it? Just oil and money and crime done by state itself?
2588 2018-10-16 19:36:49 @GrahamBlog better tread carefully with the Saudis. In care you haven’t noticed. EVERY major recession since WW2 has been triggered by some kind of energy crisis. Nixon told them to “drink their oil” and we had the 73 oil embargo
2589 2018-10-16 19:36:40 @Ford  I just found out that Starkey Ford in York Maine was just sold to a Key Auto Group. The owner had retired.  I recieved  no email, letter or phone call.  Today I called to get a oil change there and just found out. I am still in shock
2590 2018-10-16 19:36:25 It’s all fun and games having a foreign until you have to pay 300$ for an oil change ://
2591 2018-10-16 19:36:18 and agent of oil traders from SA
2592 2018-10-16 19:36:17 Really fucking tired of arguing with dumbass fucking 'vegans' that don't know their own diet. I'm fucking aware chocolate isn't vegan, but for the last fucking time PURE COCAO POWDER IS YOU DUMB FUCKS, and so is my FUCKING CANOLA OIL marg.. Educate yourself or fucking off
2593 2018-10-16 19:36:13 Most people attribute the increase in pump prices to the govt, corruption etc. But most of the “blame” if one can call it that should be attributed to global market forces and movements in the price of Brent crude oil. The reason you are paying more is due to market factors
2594 2018-10-16 19:36:08 And name one offer of help to Honduras from the US government.   The problem? No Honduran oil.
2595 2018-10-16 19:36:05 Saudi lobby, Israeli lobby (AIPAC), Gun Lobby, Big Pharma lobby. Oil lobby.
2596 2018-10-16 19:35:59 We've been using rapeseed oil for years! 
2597 2018-10-16 19:35:57 I analysed fully why oil prices are high All thanks to Mr Benel 
2598 2018-10-16 19:35:56 Who has time to change the oil in Marvin today I use rototiller in it
2599 2018-10-16 19:35:55 Amy’s mum just tried some cbd oil and said “i feel like I’ve just been at the bottom on the canal chewing all the dreads” “it’s worse than picking up dog shit”
2600 2018-10-16 19:35:50 It’s been reported there is a $220 million conditional commission owed Trump by gulf oil interests should he successfully unblock the EXXON Rostnof Arctic partnership
2601 2018-10-16 19:35:47 Oil Spill at NCCU is always epic like you cant even gas it  shit been going on since I basically been in school and always jump
2602 2018-10-16 19:35:40 If Saudis cut oil production it will raise prices. They carry a lot of weight with OPEC and they can raise rates. While we have the capacity to meet our needs the oil companies can sell where they please and that will be highest bidder
2603 2018-10-16 19:35:30 Obviously no oil as USA would have been all over it
2604 2018-10-16 19:35:29 Agreed....In order to make it more "creamy" they add oil...I learned that in 7th grade...Jiffy does as well...I always buy the Kroger brand peanut butter for that reason...Amazing what sticks in your head in 7th grade Social Studies class...we were talking about advertising IIRC.
2605 2018-10-16 19:35:17 Doing this turns non productive citizens into valuable  productive ones, through remittances, without any social services costs. GDP grows even further through this inflow and increased internal consumption.
The result is, more migration, more benefit.
2606 2018-10-16 19:34:55 Have a coffee. Do you do self care? Take good supplements like fish oil, evening primrose oil, 5-htp and l-theanine. It really helps  Allah help you.
2607 2018-10-16 19:34:54 Nigeria is the largest oil producer in Africa, producing 1.663 million barrels per day, but it's citizens are dying of hunger!!!! #ShitHOLE
2608 2018-10-16 19:34:49 The way the Rain album dey go down on iTunes list I sure say by week time ego discover oil
2609 2018-10-16 19:34:48 Hope you didn't touch her $75 bottle of extra-virgin olive oil!  Good luck, Danielle!
2610 2018-10-16 19:34:46 Libya has been better than Nigeria in the second half & they got their equaliser. 

Uzoho has been spilling the balls like Oil spillage. #PoojaFootball
2611 2018-10-16 19:34:45 Worst ... food always gets me stomach pain it must be their oil idk
2612 2018-10-16 19:34:32 Typhoon Trump is bringing his stinking tail to Houston on Monday. I really can't take the stench of oil AND fake cheese covered in Ben Gay...
2613 2018-10-16 19:34:14 Yup, stopped buying Lucas Oil racing products years ago.  If you remember when slaughterhouse Sue was alive, she was pushing hard for legalizing dog slaughter.  The USDA did put canine meat inspections in the AG approp Bill w/the help of "animals 4 profit" aka protect the harvest
2614 2018-10-16 19:34:08 i skipped a lot of inktober to oil paint and i feel bad about it but know i shouldn’t cause at least i did something! but now i feel like there’s no point in jumping back into inktober??? why am i like this lmao 
2615 2018-10-16 19:33:38 1.

Kyle - discuss Trillions in welfare to Corporate welfare queen parasites since Reagan became President - banks, oil, coal, prescription drugs, etc

Over $2 trillion of national debt is owed to Social Security
2616 2018-10-16 19:33:36 Maybe also for Trump their ability to potentially lower oil prices when Iran sanctions kick in.
2617 2018-10-16 19:33:34 I only consume medical CBD cannabis amd oil that has <1%thc. I never feel high either. But how would I know how much thc it takes to not pass the machine?! Would you issue a ticket to someone who’s car smells like cannabis without checking the blood levels of thc???
2618 2018-10-16 19:33:32 Amazing what use you can put baby oil to
2619 2018-10-16 19:33:32 @realdonaldtrump knew in advance but is subservient to these brown oil money hillbillies.
2620 2018-10-16 19:33:24 haha and i thought you never envied oil/arab money for your useless team...how the mighty have fallen
2621 2018-10-16 19:33:20 In May 2013 Former #Somali President Hassan Sheekh Mohamud signed the Soma Oil & Gas contract at the London Conference, which gave the British Govt full control of Somalia’s massive oil & gas reserves 

So in reality the men in the video are right when they say “Got Your Oil”
2622 2018-10-16 19:33:19 Financial Post: Oil could hit $200 'or double that figure': Saudis threaten to retaliate against sanctions over Khashoggi case.
2623 2018-10-16 19:33:15 Bio oil massaged into the areas where you're growing most is kind of good I think
2624 2018-10-16 19:33:13 Oil and gas industries have NOT started onr forest fire, or flood, or earthquake
2625 2018-10-16 19:33:09 This certainly makes @SenatorCollins the fool. Those promises were just the oil on the kinlin, but I rather doubt she’s too bent over it.
2626 2018-10-16 19:33:05 I think that the other big players only can change this petro-dollar domination, it’s not something that Venezuela can change, because they cannot control the market although their massive oil reserves.

2630 2018-10-16 19:32:22 If he's using it in his house, maybe he doesn't want oil and dirt to be tracked over his carpet.
2631 2018-10-16 19:31:51 Not with a bang, but with a bong Tomorrow Canada will become the first large country to legalise weed for recreational use (Uruguay did so in 2013). Canadians will be allowed to consume cannabis and cannabis oil and to grow up to four plants at home.
2632 2018-10-16 19:31:47 This really makes me sick. I have suffered from acne and it has ruined my face. I purchased the vitamin c serum, moisturizer and the green oil for acne from them. It’s so expensive I couldn’t keep up with them even if I did like them. (Wasn’t anything special in my opinion)
2633 2018-10-16 19:31:45 This one has a little olive oil in and drizzled on top, with sea salt. I do use rosemary or garlic on other occasions
2634 2018-10-16 19:31:42 I need a green candle, a brown marker, olive oil, citrine, basil, cinnamon, holy water, and Saint Joseph’s Catholic Church on E 12th street.
2635 2018-10-16 19:31:39 You'll be eating sand and drinking oil within two weeks without your buddy Trump.
2636 2018-10-16 19:31:39 The #Kashoggi case has everything to do with de-dollarization. America is broke and the Saudis still have oil. Trump is already stealing Syrian oil. No surprise if Qatar or SaudiArabia or even Venezuela is next. 20 Trillion USD has been wasted over 20y by the CIA on regime change
2637 2018-10-16 19:31:21 I'm done with the windows.  Let it snow.  I'm ready, oil tank filled, propane filled,
more food than I will need. Enough cat and dog food for 7 months.  Flash lights,
New tires on the car, car all fixed.
Did Trump call Stormy horse face.  What an asshole.

2640 2018-10-16 19:31:16 We don’t need Saudi oil anymore peeps

Time to walk away from this toxic relationship
2641 2018-10-16 19:31:15 After covering wild sockeye salmon in diced avocado and seasoning, I can confirm that you don't always need oil itself to bake things deliciously.
2642 2018-10-16 19:31:14 Gas tax in CA anyone.  I used to live LA and saw the oil rigs churning in the hills. No reason for the gas tax to be so high.
2643 2018-10-16 19:31:13 Oil prices keep going higher!
2644 2018-10-16 19:31:06 Big oil must be held accountable as well as their corrupted politicians.
2645 2018-10-16 19:31:01 Andrew - you may want to discuss Trillions of dollars in welfare to Corporate welfare queen parasites since Reagan became President 

banks

Prescription drugs, oil, coal, Apple, Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc
2646 2018-10-16 19:30:53 Show us let ....a refinery to be built in Colorado and tap into the 500 year supply of oil under the state releiving our dependency on any foreign oil the us can be top producer then
2647 2018-10-16 19:30:47 Our room has been built in the work shop and is ready to grow some beautiful babies for me to make my coconut oil out of. I'm so happy.
2648 2018-10-16 19:30:30 Is he also pumping more oil ? what the hell his investigation is going to benefit  anyone but themselves ?
2649 2018-10-16 19:30:30 Plausible deniability- Saudi’s King, MBS & Jared K tele getting the story straight. Bottom line: money, oil, power and looking into the Globe buddies. RESIGN 
2650 2018-10-16 19:30:30 They can't and won't buy my freedom by selling me cheap oil. It's much more precious than $200 barrel of oil.All I'm saying is let's build bridges,but remain cautious. If I'm not mistaken,Gabriel is an Arab so she knows them well. End of story. I won't fight Trump supporters

2652 2018-10-16 19:30:22 Does Trump really care about oil post mid-term elections?   I’m not sure he does.  Too late to move enough barrels into US storage between now and then outside what’s already on the way.    If they verbally talk down soon you know that was the tit for tat.
2653 2018-10-16 19:30:21 Bones in the Soil, Rust in the Oil
2654 2018-10-16 19:30:08 Just saw a sign at a car repair place that said “It’s back! Pumpkin Spice oil changes”
2655 2018-10-16 19:30:02 My friend....... we do not rock the boat and we do not remove or change our leaders.... learn that... Saudi is an ally and always will be... before u were born and after you are dead.... please don’t push your closest ally to price oil in yuan... and find other allies
2656 2018-10-16 19:29:43 Keep some good fats in your diet. Almonds, walnuts, olive oil, and avocado.
2657 2018-10-16 19:29:30 Texas oil is booming right now, which gives people jobs. so sure what ever u say "labelist."
2658 2018-10-16 19:29:26 I love how CNN is skirting around the fact that the Saudi's have been doing this for years. They Persecute Woman , gays and non- muslims and anyone who talks ill of the crown. EVERY administration has ignored it in lieu of money and oil.
2659 2018-10-16 19:29:24 I am going to single handedly keep the automotive industry afloat today also if your oil pan flies off of your car, I did that. My bad and shit.
2660 2018-10-16 19:29:19 which essential oil will give me a full bank account
2661 2018-10-16 19:29:19 Nice Rob. Do you ever do any Focaccia's with anything added, like garlic, thyme, olive oil?
2662 2018-10-16 19:29:17 Getting my oil change and hella debating whether I should make a pit stop home... to see my piggy
2663 2018-10-16 19:29:11 got an oil change & now my car sounds brand new 
2664 2018-10-16 19:29:08 an oil drop not a oil drop
2665 2018-10-16 19:29:04 Pay what price? What are we going to do to them? Disrupt our strategic relationship? In July we imported 876,000 barrels of oil a day from Saudi Arabia, 11.1 percent of our total imports. OPEC provides us with 33.7 percent of our imported oil. We can’t turn off the tap.
2666 2018-10-16 19:28:58 Screw the Saudis and release the oil reserves.
2667 2018-10-16 19:28:54 Ummm, have a look at your profile picture. You ain’t no oil painting either.
2668 2018-10-16 19:28:49 call for　～を呼び求める、必要とする

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
2669 2018-10-16 19:28:45 Not long before oil is traded in euros instead of dollars - then shit gets real 
2670 2018-10-16 19:28:23 Maybe the oil and gas surveyor in the picture should allow fracking next to his house to show how safe it is.
2671 2018-10-16 19:28:21 Paid $37 for a $100 oil change
2672 2018-10-16 19:28:12 The company behind KIND bars pretends like they’re compassionate and positive, but they use palm oil in their overpriced bar of almonds stuck together with sugar and puffed rice.
2673 2018-10-16 19:27:59 We know who the ‘entitled’ are. They’re in the cabinet, in the Oval Office, in the oil, refinery and mining industry, Media Heads, Heads of State,. Organized crime the lot of them. End Citizens United
2674 2018-10-16 19:27:56 Cimet change will destroy all of us for your bribing oil money??
2675 2018-10-16 19:27:55 *send out snap of my hand stuck in a jar*

2688 2018-10-16 19:25:58 He might need to.  That Aramco IPO is D E A D for the forseeable future.

Would would you pay for minority stake in a state owned oil company whose leader chops up journalists and puts them in boxes?

2692 2018-10-16 19:25:32 Was already in the recession by then. The Gulf War hurt not because of the budget, but because of the oil price shock.
2693 2018-10-16 19:25:22 we’ve got the answer. now what? #sanctions against #SaudiArabia — yes, including their fucking oil. #cleanenergy
2694 2018-10-16 19:25:19 One...wait two disgusting human beings. Who would have ever thot a porn sleaze and a snake oil salesmen would be the heroes of the democRAT party?
2695 2018-10-16 19:25:06 Also, just so y'all know. @venezuela dropped the US Petrodollar on all foreign oil transactions. Y'all should do some research for yourselves as to what this could mean for the long term.  Not by surprise, US mainstream news hasnt covered this. @FoxNews @CNN @MSNBC DO YOUR JOBS
2696 2018-10-16 19:25:05 Finally getting this oil change...gotta take more care of my baby 
2697 2018-10-16 19:24:59 Hey, Colorado friends! I'm just one citizen rather than a mayor in the pocket of oil & gas, and I urge you to vote #YESonProp112!

Climate change is real. Clean air & water are vital to existence.

Those inflated job statistics won't matter if the state's on fire.
2698 2018-10-16 19:24:55 I’ve use Burts Bee’s! I have their muma bee oil and their belly butter! I’m only 19 weeks so can’t really comment on their success just yet, but it smells amazing & love that it doesn’t have any nasties in it!
2699 2018-10-16 19:24:53 All of these #NoOn112 people are obviously bots for the oil and gas industry... just click on some and look at their profiles. Look at what they post. Only policy tweets. From “normal family people” don’t be fooled by these shills! #YesOn112
2700 2018-10-16 19:24:45 Tincture can get you a little high, if made with actual cannabis. CBD oil cannot. Esp if made from pure CIBIDI isolate.
2701 2018-10-16 19:24:40 Which is more dangerous?

Spending 14 days working in the blistering heat on an oil derrick with equipment that can kill you if you don’t pay enough attention, or working 14 hour days in an air conditioned office building at a computer programming a video game?
2702 2018-10-16 19:24:23 Yup. Notely was single handedly responsible for the oil price crisis. Yup she could have hacked and slashed and said “everybody for themselves” but now critics howl as the corner has been turned and somehow think Kenney will take them back to “the good old days”. Really?
REALLY??
2703 2018-10-16 19:24:20 THINK ABOUT HOW MANY LIVES HAVE BEEN LOST DUE TO ILLNESS, WAR, POLLUTION, LIKE AIR, WATER, LAND, ALL FROM A BUNCH OF DINOSAUR JUICE, CAUSE THAT'S WHAT OIL IS, A BUNCH OF DEAD DINOSAUR JUICE, AND WE BEEN RUNNING THE WORLD WITH IT SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME!!!

2707 2018-10-16 19:23:52 Saudi’s put millions in Trump’s pocket.

Trump sells the Saudi’s who are the architects of 9/11 billions in weapons that may someday be used against us.

The Saudi’s sell oil to Trump’s climate denying fossil fuel donors.

And that is why Trump believes the Saudi’s.
2708 2018-10-16 19:23:46 Well I clearly suck because I haven't even reviewed it yet and I've had it for a few months. I'd compare it to the better BH cosmetics formulas. It does have mineral oil in the formula, which some people might have a reaction to it.

2711 2018-10-16 19:23:32 Quick reminder to change your oil. Also try not to let your fuel get below 1/4 tank, your fuel pump will thank you
2712 2018-10-16 19:23:30 Lock stock and two smoking barrels of oil.

2715 2018-10-16 19:23:13 Hey there, great question! Aurora Cloud is indeed made by the same CO2 extraction process as our current CBD oil extracts, and it's available now! We are working hard to ensure that Aurora Cloud becomes a staple in the online shop, so more units will be stocked soon. 
2716 2018-10-16 19:23:06 I feel the same way.  I thought maybe I missed something. So we will cut off our nose to save our face over a man who isn't American. 1 man and we are willing to sanction?  Oil will double in price.
2717 2018-10-16 19:23:03 Just put some thicker oil in 20-50w should do the trick.
2718 2018-10-16 19:22:51 Much better real sprats in oil, than false salmon or cheese from China ;-P And don't forget, this sprats in oil eats all russians from western till easter border ;-)
2719 2018-10-16 19:22:40 Bokuto: you wouldn't believe what Kuroo dared me to do, he asked me to oil myself up and do, like, this aerobic pose in tiny shorts and i thought it was so uncool but people were really into it on instagram haha
Akaashi: *wheezes* ...please stay warm, Bokuto-san
2720 2018-10-16 19:22:40 Then eat it or put a few drops of oil under your tongue.

2722 2018-10-16 19:22:14 No, he's a traitor who conspired with Putin's Russia to steal the election from the American people.  He is snake oil salesman who has been rewarded by the GOP who manipulated their own constituency  to vote against their own self interest.

2728 2018-10-16 19:21:36 What's also is bad ab Warren and her DNA test, it takes the attention away of the real issues and struggle of indigenous people. If she cared she should have put her energy in supporting the fight against the oil pipeline, or any other good fight.
2729 2018-10-16 19:21:26 I am waiting for them to finish changing my oil and these two old people, who just met each other, are talking about how great Trump has done and how “God” chose him to do this job like yeah okay sure Debra.
2730 2018-10-16 19:21:26 Bin Laden was Saudi..the former ambassador to the US and others funded terrorists.. really? Is their oil worth it?
Are they really that helpful with terrorists?
2731 2018-10-16 19:21:25 There are nearly 3 million miles of pipelines in North America right now, moving oil, gas and derivatives. 

Whats the failure rate? What is yearly mortality rate?

I will wait while you look.

The truth is these countries are exporting their unemployable poor.
2740 2018-10-16 19:20:23 My doctor told me to put olive oil on my sons head let it sit for 15 minutes then use a soft bristle brush to flake them off, & repeat every week if it doesn’t go away completely. We only had to do it once!
2741 2018-10-16 19:20:10 Iam super loyal kodwa wena ne super loyal is water and oil

2746 2018-10-16 19:19:23 Please don’t mind me. I sat at the dealership for three hours for an oil change and air filter. 

Don’t car maintenance and reactionary tweet, kids.
2747 2018-10-16 19:19:19 Stop tip toeing around . They did , cut the ties ,take the results as a long needed correction . If the wealthy and the rest of of of suffer perhaps it is deserved We have been deliberating Asleep at the wheel for yrs with Sharia Saudis out of GREED for Oil

2749 2018-10-16 19:19:12 at the dealership getting my oil changed, let’s see how many other things they try to upset me with today
2750 2018-10-16 19:19:07 Trump via Pompeo and Prince Salman doing all the damage control. The oil has been spilled. The Future Investment Initiative has been jeopardised.
2751 2018-10-16 19:19:06 Really? Damn. Imagine if it hadn't been surpressed? We could have a totally different world now. No massively powerful oil companies denying climate change. No rise in alzeimers, asthma and learning difficulties directly associated with breathing in car fumes 
2752 2018-10-16 19:19:03 In the oil sub-sector, a total of 111 exploration & appraisal wells have been drilled in our country since 2006.
99 encountered oil or gas in the sub-surface, which is one of the highest globally.

The Bush family holds hands with them, Obama helps drone civilians with them and now Donald says Saudis create American jobs. All because of oil.
2756 2018-10-16 19:18:52 Someone on my TL said it's peppermint oil
2757 2018-10-16 19:18:48 And the Dems opened up to fossil fuel contributions again- because Labor in Big Oil and workers wanted to be able to donate to the Democrats.
You missed that part. I know it sucks but you can’t ignore workers rights and freedoms even if they work in the fossil fuel industry.
2758 2018-10-16 19:18:22 Fayose went to EFCC with bag of clothes, slippers, olive oil, bedsheets, pillow, mattress, English and Yoruba bible.

2760 2018-10-16 19:18:05 "Just spoke with the Crown Prince who said if the US doesn't back off,  he'll cancel the orders for all the F35s and M1 Abrams, and turn off the oil taps." Incredible to see such obvious,  furious back pedalling from POTUS.
2761 2018-10-16 19:17:37 If the Saudis want to play dumb and continue to rely on their oil status to protect them, then its time for some gunboat diplomacy. Take Fifth Fleet and shut down their oil exports. Somebody will get thrown under the bus real quick, and it'll send a message to the rest.
2762 2018-10-16 19:17:30 Clear conflict of interest when he jailed the anti-fracking protestors as his families company supplies the oil rigs who invested in Cuadrilla the fracking company. Corruption is the constant theme running through the Tory establishment
2763 2018-10-16 19:17:29 Coconut oil, coconut oil, coconut oil!
2764 2018-10-16 19:17:24 We don’t need oil. We produce oil. We have gas for decades to come. Time for Saudis to improve on human rights.
2765 2018-10-16 19:17:22 It has to do with MbS wanting to be seen as a BSD.

It has to do with the transportation of oil. It has to do with a proxy war between Saudi and Iran.
2766 2018-10-16 19:17:07 U.S.A., looking for oil, water, gold, everywhere with guns.
2767 2018-10-16 19:17:05 Well, the oil is a given. Also, Israel is a given. It obviously “trumps” human lives. It’s disgusting and tragically sad and it will continue w/ no punishment to SA.
2768 2018-10-16 19:16:48 Curious to know how many Trinbagonians are aware that Trinidad and Tobago hasn’t been an oil based economy for quite some time (think: > 10 years) now
2769 2018-10-16 19:16:47 @richardquest it would be preposterous, your guest says for Saudis to raise price of oil and doesn’t think they’d even contemplate such a terrible act.
2770 2018-10-16 19:16:45 Keep help poor country .us is the strong country in the word , if you need oil you need to invest only by increasing infra instruction on these country more people get job income flow then register the tittle property in Washington DC without war without losing life soldier

Roast them. In oil or butter with some tarragon. Definitely more calories then!!
2773 2018-10-16 19:16:19 He's not going to, also he's confusing wealth with political power. It's possible to by oil from another country without undermining NATO. Trump has only ever undermined NATO. Although it did give us Trump being laughed at on an international stage.

2781 2018-10-16 19:15:29 You know, with all this talk about Saudi oil, maybe, just maybe, we should try to turn to a more sustainable and renewable energy resource? Just a thought.
2782 2018-10-16 19:15:27 @cmonriss is literally a car dad, shes like GAH DAMMIT LACE YA PROB DONT EVEN KNOW HOW TUH CHANGE YA OIL
2783 2018-10-16 19:15:12 Unfortunately our Bernie is from Vermont,  an agricultural state. He will not take on the agricultural industry because they keep him in Congress. But you are correct. We all must go #vegan. #ChrisHedges says the same thing.
Big ag is worse than big oil.
2784 2018-10-16 19:15:12 Take away their armies, or their oil, and then Trump will stand up.  Look at his "big bold" tweet to the leader of Honduras.
2785 2018-10-16 19:15:06 Trump is covering the crown prince's ass -- he doesn't want to lose his cozy relationship with the Saudis -- the Saudis buy Trump property, rent his hotel rooms in Washington and sell us oil -- Trump turned his back on Saudi human rights violations and the murder of a journalist
2786 2018-10-16 19:14:59 so Im happy to stop interfering in peoples "free" choices if the oil, food, gambling, tobacco, alcohol etc industries and their sock puppets are equally happy to stop interfering in "free choices"

2789 2018-10-16 19:14:30 Why are oil changes soooo expensive 
2790 2018-10-16 19:14:16 Ray Catena has a huge place to stay busy? The maybach needs an oil change?
2791 2018-10-16 19:14:15 Lowkey
2792 2018-10-16 19:14:10 It matters that Trump is close to the Saudi regime. But the U.K. media will also be at the forefront of re-casting the murder of a journalist as a rogue event. Arms contracts, Oil trade and special relationships are not going to be undone by a sudden lurch to moral leadership.
2793 2018-10-16 19:14:00 Is $80 a lot for an oil change
2794 2018-10-16 19:13:57 That cbd oil done me dirty, i feel like a lump of skin, tired but feels piff tho

2796 2018-10-16 19:13:31 We have plenty of our own oil but the Democrat liberals want us dependent on Saudi Arabia & foreign oil.  So stop complaining.  We are dependent just like you wanted.
2797 2018-10-16 19:13:31 Thanks L Houlihan - CBD Oil for the follow! Much appreciated. #LetThemKnow #iSeeYou #NewFollower
2798 2018-10-16 19:13:26 None of the above will matter if the politicians (both sides) have their way with pushing sanctions on Saudi Arabia. That's a very fine line. A hit on oil will hurt like nothing else, as will the loss in sales. Have the Saudi's King punish those involved. Then leave it there.
2799 2018-10-16 19:13:07 Definitely cradle cap and definitely normal! They can get it pretty much at any young age. It’s like dandruff for babies. Their scalp gets dry and it’s just got nowhere to go like ours does when we brush our hair. Just use some baby oil and either a soft bristled brush or comb 
2800 2018-10-16 19:13:05 Y’all the money has been flowing ever since I been leaving my wallet at my money alter overnight while sleeping and using the oil I made a few weeks ago. 
2801 2018-10-16 19:13:05 The Saudi's killed that guy because he question the crown. Lets pretend like it was a " rouge killer" but no they have been doing this for years and the only reason the west hasnt cared is money and oil.
2802 2018-10-16 19:13:03 Russia: Oil. Money.
2803 2018-10-16 19:12:59 Saudi needs to be held accountable for the murder of the missing WP Conteibutor! How dare them threaten to talk about oil prices going up at a time like this. Fuck the oil, you killed a American Citizen. Trump, don't be blindsided o.n this. These people dont think like we do
2804 2018-10-16 19:12:54 The prophet of God told the widow to go bring the anything from her house. She found a jar of oil. She borrowed more drums. You have something you can use till u borrow for expansion. Trust me
2805 2018-10-16 19:12:53 @TuckerCarlson be much better had the British and French had tried harder to keep the land they occupied prior to 1922. They occupied what is now Saudi Arabia.
The British and French would control the worlds oil. Both countries are kicking themselves.
Would a Brit Prince kill ?
2806 2018-10-16 19:12:43 If it’s only oil leaks, you could just fix the worst ones and keep driving. It’s a general rule not to just take the word of the first people that say you need massive repairs.

2809 2018-10-16 19:12:26 Germany you buy oil from Russia giving them Millions of dollars so Russia can build up their military and be a threat to YOU and NATO and you want the USA to defend you MORONS all I got to say is DAM RIGHT we  have the right to meddle. Maybe PAY your 2% of GDP to NATO and PAY USA
2810 2018-10-16 19:12:23 @WilfredFrost oil market ?
2811 2018-10-16 19:12:23 And yet we still buy their oil
2812 2018-10-16 19:12:22 We're beyond that. Already got the baby oil out
2813 2018-10-16 19:12:17 The job na
2814 2018-10-16 19:12:10 India has increased Iranian oil imports and snubbed USA pleas for support of Saudi Arabia & Israel in threatening  Iran. Trumps bluster and bullying is not working.
2815 2018-10-16 19:11:56 I did when I first started, I noticed that washing my hair in cooler water and using a conditioner with Argan Oil and Biotin helped a lot. I already have super thin hair though :/
2816 2018-10-16 19:11:44 Tell them we want cheap cheap cheap oil 
2817 2018-10-16 19:11:34 Cann will have 3 licenses if they buy cannacure.  2 cultivation 1 oil production
2818 2018-10-16 19:11:22 Biscuits purchased without palm oil for the dole!
2819 2018-10-16 19:11:17 BUSH: OIL. MONEY. SAUDI: OIL. MONEY.
2820 2018-10-16 19:11:14 The Cafe Mac Pizza for dinner today will be: moist crust with sweet coconut oil and meat lovers.
2821 2018-10-16 19:11:13 Exactly! When I read the threat from SI I was shocked that we still get so much oil from them - I thought all that shale, etc. made us essentially an oil exporter. I now get my electricity from windmills in PA ... it's a start ...
2822 2018-10-16 19:11:08 The #USA will do nothing about the Saudi killing of the reporter. They have proven time and time again that they value the $$ over human life. Their participation in the destruction of the Middle East for oil and arms sales proves this, but the public and the UN will do nothing!
2823 2018-10-16 19:11:08 oil futures agree
2824 2018-10-16 19:11:06 He ‘s there to help them with their cover up. Trump & Pompeo want to put sanctions on Iran & need Saudi oil. Saudi human rights violations in Yemen, murdering of dissidents & a respected journalist is ok   - it’s Iran we’re  after.  What liars & hypocrites.
2825 2018-10-16 19:11:02 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
2826 2018-10-16 19:11:00 WHY THE FUCK DOES THE DUDE AT VALVOLINE GIVING ME A OIL CHANGE THINK IM OBLIGATED TO SPEAK TO HIM...

2828 2018-10-16 19:10:42 anyone going through belly/intestinal pains i highly suggest cbd oil. shit changed my life!!
2829 2018-10-16 19:10:23 Guess I get my oil change
2830 2018-10-16 19:10:22 The only time I see people be adamantly against Prop 112 in Colorado is when they profit from Oil/Gas directly...and there argument is always "what about the taxes?"

...and that aint it boss.
2831 2018-10-16 19:10:21 ナルルちゃーん、俺の机ちょっと片付けて…くれないよねー
2832 2018-10-16 19:10:16 Well MBS won’t go. No MBS No Oil :) 
You select ;)
2833 2018-10-16 19:10:14 Yeah I can see that. I always always moisturize before makeup and I even use facial oil. I just blot throughout the day and hope for the best
2834 2018-10-16 19:10:14 @MightyCroz @thedavidcrosby Is this your product? I bought your old Lps 2 or 3 times each,depending on who borrowed but didn’t return.If this is your company I’ll start buying my oil from u.I have spinal arthritis:(
2835 2018-10-16 19:10:12 I’ve now read the entire IPCC report... only solution. Space elevator, fleet of space oil tankers, 3D printers, and turn the asteroid belt into a giant solar cell. Beam the energy back to earth. What’s the timeline on that project... ps you’ll need all the industries on earth
2836 2018-10-16 19:10:05 え、君顎あるの？顎ってやっぱりどこかで買うの？僕顎持ってないんだけど。
2837 2018-10-16 19:10:02 Boomers fought hard for clean energy over the decades, inventing alternatives to oil which were bought up and blackshelved by the greedy in power while they carried on polluting oceans, rivers, and lands. It took decades to get even weak overly expensive solar, and electric cars.
2838 2018-10-16 19:09:57 One supports big oil and corporate interests. The other supports the people. He might as well have criminal record.
2839 2018-10-16 19:09:56 but why Pakistan is making Electricity by using much expensive furnace oil???

why are we not using other resources which are low costs????

we are the costliest electricity producers by using furnace oil. 

need other low cost resources. not price hikes on essentials.
2840 2018-10-16 19:09:54 Damn i just almost slipped in oil on the floor at work and i was like damn i wish i would’ve slipped slipped but i just thought about that month i was just out and now im like nahh
2841 2018-10-16 19:09:53 Try extremely new things, like making sardine sauce with palm oil!
2842 2018-10-16 19:09:48 I did a olive oil hair mask & my hair is soooooo oily, it literally won’t wash out
2843 2018-10-16 19:09:47 Mark my words...oil price will go up before the end of the week
2844 2018-10-16 19:09:40 This Michelle Obama body oil got you smelling like a million Dollas
2845 2018-10-16 19:09:30 My wife prefers oil as a grease, makes the crêpes thinner. I don’t ;)
2846 2018-10-16 19:09:30 "I really shouldn't fill up on bread" I say as I dip my 4th piece in olive oil knowing damn well I'll still enjoy my meal
2847 2018-10-16 19:09:24 Those fumes are #ElizabethWarren - she just blew herself up politically. Smells horrendous. Vote her out!

We need the strong winds to carry her out to an oil rig. That would be fun. Oil rig survival in the sun. Maybe then she'd have a tad of "color" that she claims to be. #MA
2848 2018-10-16 19:09:21 Donald totally needs to look in the mirror. He is no oil painting himself. #DonaldTrump
2849 2018-10-16 19:09:17 OK, I'm coming up on @BBCNewsHour (radio) to discuss Saudi Arabia, US relations, business and oil issues, etc. #OOTT
2850 2018-10-16 19:09:12 omg! I mean tbh from my past experience with peppermint oil if she’d gotten it that would have burned too! Anyways this one tastes like a watered down ashtray but also I’m maybe cured?
2851 2018-10-16 19:09:06 No such thing as a "CANOLA" plant, never was. 
CANOLA is a created acronym for: CANADA OIL.
2852 2018-10-16 19:09:06 @realDonaldTrump Trump is covering the crown prince's ass -- Trump does business with the Saudis and wants Saudi oil -- the Saudis murdered a Washington Post journalist -- a man was seen on film with a bone saw -- Turks say the Saudis are repainting the consulate ...
2853 2018-10-16 19:09:05 “i’ve never used cocknut oil”
2854 2018-10-16 19:08:55 Venezuela is 80% capitalist. The 'shortages' in supply are in this sector. Ironically, meat, veg and fuel oil is under government control and there are no shortage in these staples!
2855 2018-10-16 19:08:47 @EdmontonOilers Would love a win for my 40th birthday :)  Go Oil Go!!
2856 2018-10-16 19:08:38 Saudi Prince MBS has told Trump and the Republican Congress to kiss his ass, STFU, get on your knees and keep sucking my oil pipeline. 
Remember: "I am the Crown Prince and you are not".
2857 2018-10-16 19:08:37 "data is the new oil" in that its negative externalities have already doomed our civilization but we just haven't quite noticed yet
2858 2018-10-16 19:08:22 I love garlic. Olive oil. Lemon. Chili. Bay leaf.
2859 2018-10-16 19:08:20 We don’t need their oil. If they raise prices we could lower ours and crush that 14th century theocracy,
2860 2018-10-16 19:08:12 The real question is.. Is it worth the fight... Higher oil .. higher gas..   Most journalist are scum anyways...  just look at CNN.   I don't wanna pay more at the gas pump for this!
2861 2018-10-16 19:08:10 Exactly! I can't even.... also, many of the iconicised vegan foods are actually those also destroying rainforests etc because dairy alternatives often rely on things like coconut and palm oil.
2862 2018-10-16 19:08:08 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed #TexasDebate
2863 2018-10-16 19:08:02 So because of oil you brazenly enter into any country to commit murder? You run to the west to spend your holidays while you keep your people in servitude in this modern age
2864 2018-10-16 19:07:56 How about giving up your millions of dollars first and stop being a hypocrite. You ran on bringing a revolution to politics... Instead you have become another caricatured liberal shill raking in money while preaching about climate change as you still use oil and gas.
2865 2018-10-16 19:07:56 Trump wants all the Crown Princes power so that’s one reason he loves plus ALL THE GOLDE OIL MONEY HE’S ALREADY SHOWERED ON HIM! Melania also loves to sit on his Golden Toilets!
2866 2018-10-16 19:07:55 "I never used cocknut oil" - laur 2018
2867 2018-10-16 19:07:55 My aunt really came thru with the chrism oil for my mom to put on my forehead and throat after my surgery
2868 2018-10-16 19:07:49 Extracting oil from Palm fruits/seeds then making soap from it. 
Something like that
2869 2018-10-16 19:07:36 Reduce oil price and show your commitment to @realDonaldTrump
2870 2018-10-16 19:07:29 Is funny how the Prince threatened I will give u my Oil  if u guys keep talking bout #Khashoggi
2871 2018-10-16 19:07:28 And how great is their reliance on coal for energy production? China isn't home to huge amounts of oil.  Their investment in solar, while great, is of necessity. More oil to China would also reduce their GHGs if it offset coal production.
2872 2018-10-16 19:07:28 Liar liar pants on fire! Cut off saudi oil! @VP SCP wants Demcons n 2018! Cut off SRMOs! Pants on fire! jlucci @realDonaldTrump: WOW, Joh...
2873 2018-10-16 19:07:01 "In Social Media the “squeaky wheel” gets the oil. You have to put yourself out there, to find people who will relate or even debate with you, depending on what you are looking for." ~ Jessica Northey ... #inspiration #socialmediatips
2874 2018-10-16 19:06:58 giorno probably wouldn't take on a modeling job and be more of an accidental model, while mista would be very ready to stand in a room full of people, show his goods and get paid for it..... his stripper vibe is just stronger while giorno is commissioned oil painting material lol
2875 2018-10-16 19:06:55 City should thank oil pipe lines
2876 2018-10-16 19:06:52 The fact we have so much of our own oil gives us a lot of leverage
2877 2018-10-16 19:06:49 Aur meri to ha koi Nai api apki ho gi unki dafa main oil wo bhi olive use kar loo ga ya phir room soundproof banwa loo ga ap bhi tension na lo @Mujahid22417240
2878 2018-10-16 19:06:48 It's not a stupid question. Rose water is not enough moisturizer.  You may want to invest in an oil free moisturizer. Neutrogena oil free acne moisturiser is a budget friendly one. If you want to be fancy, you can do Neutrogena hydroboost water gel moisturizer
2879 2018-10-16 19:06:41 Just understand you try to fuck with us we can push a button and blow up all your oil industry ! Then what you rag head motherfuckers going to do BITCHS !!!!!!
2880 2018-10-16 19:06:31 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed #TexasDebate
2881 2018-10-16 19:06:17 I deeply hope that Venezuela's future isn't so bleak. 

For Vzla to return to a semblance of its former glory, the economy needs to be run responsibly and diversified greatly to reduce oil dependence. 

And, leaders need to have the vision not to keep everything for themslves.
2882 2018-10-16 19:06:16 Bullshit. Fracking dates back to the civil war area, was further developed around 1947, then actually developed by Standard Oil.  Give me a break.  AND EVEN IF the DOE paid for it, what the Hell does Standard Oil need that money for?   They are a hundred billion $ company.
2883 2018-10-16 19:06:05 I can say if this turns out the Saudi’s did this, and we move forward with the oil deal, my support for this man will change drastically.
2884 2018-10-16 19:05:56 I’m not trying your case but I’m in a giving mood. You must stop trying to create problems in August Town. Yuh fi tap e. Responsible citizens would ensure that information gets to the authorities for action you don’t try to oil fire simple
2885 2018-10-16 19:05:55 Wahhabism. The source of all radical Islam and founded in Saudi Arabia. But oil money trumps radical Muslim ideology on the world stage. Almost disgusted at being the same species as these individuals
2886 2018-10-16 19:05:50 When the Republicans saw it starting to cut into their oil profits
2887 2018-10-16 19:05:37 The US Crude Weekly Inventory Report is a forecast of weekly crude inventory levels provided by Thomson Reuters Oil Research.  TR Oil Research forecast crude inventories increased by 6.1 million barrels for the week ending October 12th, 2018.
2888 2018-10-16 19:05:29 Hello remember me that rosemary oil does help thank you
2889 2018-10-16 19:05:21 A Saudi planned and carried out the 9/11 attack, his co-conspirators, Saudis, the Saudi Government his family, financed him and aided him in hiding afterward. The Saudi government murders a journalist, still we do nothing, why? Oil and the connection to US businesses & politicos.
2890 2018-10-16 19:05:10 And she was silent while the oil mercenaries terrorized the DAPL water protectors.
2891 2018-10-16 19:05:03 Mine has it and she’s 8 months now It’ll go away, I just brush her hair in circles during bath then use a little bit of coconut oil not a lot though
2892 2018-10-16 19:05:00 There's that minute where you wonder how Pompeo can shake hands with MBS, and then you see the WaPo folks fan-boying rapist Kobe Bryant (alleged, technically, I suppose), and you think well, at least Pompeo is debasing himself for oil or cash or whatever.
2893 2018-10-16 19:04:58 But the palm oil is the sauce, what makes it the Abacha
2894 2018-10-16 19:04:52 And dat box be slippery like tryna walk on oil
2895 2018-10-16 19:04:51 Curl them, wear a primer. It will help :) also coconut oil every time you are done wearing makeup.
2896 2018-10-16 19:04:48 Ask Pence how he bankrupted Kiel Oil  Co.
2897 2018-10-16 19:04:44 Did you also ask him about the fact most of the 9-11 hijackers had Saudi citizenship. Nothing to see here folks - aside from oil and arms interests! Just move along and ignore the blood on their/our hands!
2898 2018-10-16 19:04:40 Ran out of time. Gotta break for big oil ads.
2899 2018-10-16 19:04:39 Ted "Valero" Cruz is only in office to do the bidding of big corporations and big oil. He wont even stand up for his wife and father what makes you think he will stand up for you?
Vote @BetoORourke
2900 2018-10-16 19:04:38 Cut bait with that despicable country already.  Oil isnt worth looking the other way
2901 2018-10-16 19:04:35 i have to go get my oil changed by myself and i’m nervous lol smh 
2902 2018-10-16 19:04:33 Has Trudeau  cancelled the Suadi contract for $15B worth of "jeeps" yet?
Has Trudeau approved Energy East so we never have to buy Saudi oil ever again?
2903 2018-10-16 19:04:33 Give me dry oil wells and the pipes that led the oil to sea and i can evaporate seawater using geothermal heat to make rain clouds (evaporation is a cooling effect)
would also irrigate more crops and provide sea salt as a byproduct
Stop using oil and we can control climate easy
2904 2018-10-16 19:04:29 Time for the US to produce and supply  it’s own oil,
2905 2018-10-16 19:04:13 Mr. president don’t worry, you will win the upcoming election, and the oil price will be up. Just get out of it and take care of your people.
2906 2018-10-16 19:04:07 Operation against encroachment, oil and gas prices hikes as everything was looted by Sharif's and zardari and co, no government machinery was used to influence election, 100 percent free and fair election,no pre and poll ringing....
2907 2018-10-16 19:04:05 Sears went bankrupt, Ariana and Pete Davidson drama break-up (engagement ring returned, custody of pig   in question), Prime debuts The Romanovs (from Madmen writer, accused of sexual harassment), gold up, oil down.
2908 2018-10-16 19:04:03 Overdo what?
2909 2018-10-16 19:04:00 @arunjaitley just see your old video on patrol price during UPA govt..

You said " if crude oil price in 90 $ , patrol should not cost more than 50 Rs."

And you want us to believe in you..

2916 2018-10-16 19:03:29 So a hunted wild deer would be more vegan than palm oil because fewer animals were harmed & a deer is not a keystone animal. & I'd be protecting orangutans from death & loss of habitat.

2920 2018-10-16 19:03:19 That's tough! Melania out.... Rocket Man weak sauce. He is out. Putin or big oil? Who is more evil? Putin wins. Trump is a straight up gangster and Putin is a big gangster than he is. OPEC is a mob, not a man.
2921 2018-10-16 19:03:09 I'm sure there's a metaphor for Brexit in there somewhere. You should have cooled it down with a liberal splodge of chilli oil!

2923 2018-10-16 19:03:01 And won't leak oil! Any old Jag owner will know what I mean!
2924 2018-10-16 19:02:56 There is an old Greek adage that fits right in... "Too much oil, but no pankake" (πολύ λάδι αλλά από τηγανητα τίποτε...)
2925 2018-10-16 19:02:48 They should prepare for imminent US invasion, sounds like a country with that much oil needs some freedom.
2926 2018-10-16 19:02:36 Please sanction the Saudis.... I have bought call options on Crude Oil
2927 2018-10-16 19:02:30 How about the Saudi's have been doing this sh_t for years and nothing from the west because of oil. NOTHING money is more important than a human life or a womans rights or a gays rights is the message we have been sending them.
2928 2018-10-16 19:02:25 Sir, remembering that petroleum is used for a lot more than just fuel (plsstics, for example), if America could eliminate the need for oil as a fuel (cars/home heat/power generation) would we have to care about the Middle East? Or they to care about us?
2929 2018-10-16 19:02:14 I was responding to why the pump prices have increased in BW. Yes, NPF debacle “may” have contributed as it has historically been used by Govt to cushion the movement in oil prices, but with an increase of 50% in Brent, NPF cushioning would’ve be minimal. This is a global issue.
2930 2018-10-16 19:02:07 I have oil on my hand..i will use my leg
2931 2018-10-16 19:02:04 "We love your oil."  "We love your money."  (warm laughter)
2932 2018-10-16 19:01:59 A life has been taken.  Someone who had family and loved ones. No amount of money is worth a human life. There should be severe consequences but oil and money will more than likely prevail.

2946 2018-10-16 19:00:48 Well, not specifically, but they are great for differentiating (not perfectly) between the makers and the snake oil salesmen. All reddit forums and twitter communities seem to be full of people with ideas on marketing an seo & course selling.... not real value. Posionous actually
2947 2018-10-16 19:00:47 Lolz abeg if u need more oil ,I have
2948 2018-10-16 19:00:47 Не спать и не сдохнуть. То есть просто не уставать и не иметь потребность во сне. Или же научиться спать 2,5 — 3 часа. И тогда всё будет збс.
2949 2018-10-16 19:00:44 theories that have yet to be explored in the khashoggi disappearance:
-spontaneous combustion
-like an andy kaufman situation?
-entered the red room (smell of burnt motor oil)
-is living as a woman
-in space
2950 2018-10-16 19:00:41 Wondering if anyone else #keto gets the same feeling... strong 4tbsp MCT oil in coffee - good keto energy yet feel like wanna puke?

2956 2018-10-16 19:00:06 In places like Oklahoma the big oil companies are cornering the market with hemp and legislation limiting normal folks. It is about control of resources...not doing the right thing.

2959 2018-10-16 18:59:49 So...we’re not going to oil up and wrestle? I need an answer. Mum is making chicken wings and she needs to know how many people are coming .
2960 2018-10-16 18:59:39 I agree, but Big Buff being out isn't a negative for the Oil
2961 2018-10-16 18:59:38 they still want to sell more oil fast ....  counter productive
2962 2018-10-16 18:59:26 no, coconut oil will not help. take your dog to the god damned vet.
2963 2018-10-16 18:59:17 I second the essential oil diffuser idea! Lavendar oil and Cedarwood oil knocks them out and smells amazing and soothing.
2964 2018-10-16 18:59:01 Very inspiring. We should get more Ugandans to do amazing work in the oil sector. Local content is not a far thought. We can do it.
2965 2018-10-16 18:58:59 Fracking is the peak level of authoritarianism.
Oil economy destroying the planet for profit.
Fracking directly destroying our home.
And people objecting are directly ignored by the people who are meant to represent them, using the people who are meant to protect them, to arrest
2966 2018-10-16 18:58:55 Give my 13 year old dog CBD oil every night. I just started. 50 is a milestone worth forgetting!
2967 2018-10-16 18:58:48 Best recent example is Russia 2014 where CBR tried in vain to fight impact of fall in oil on ruble but eventually forced to deval and hike big
2968 2018-10-16 18:58:37 Both Russia and the U.S is interested in Venezuela because of it's large oil reserves.

Russia is talking about a military base there and the U.S wants to invade.

2973 2018-10-16 18:58:17 I’m looking to do more watercolor oil painting commissions (portraits of people or pets)
2974 2018-10-16 18:58:15 they're really tasty, i have been tormented by thoughts of oil painting for over a semester now and i KNOW i'm not particularly good...
2975 2018-10-16 18:57:51 i came to discount tires to get a tire patched and while i was waiting i heard some dude ask for an oil change 
2976 2018-10-16 18:57:50 We (U.S. gov) should have been working to establish our independence from foreign oil starting in 1973.  Our own homegrown oil-barrens prevented it, putting their own interests above the greater good.
2977 2018-10-16 18:57:45 When it's not oil blocs you wanna share.... 

They usually unite to loot!
2978 2018-10-16 18:57:34 You are not developed to uphold human rights. Money and Oil don't define true development and civilization.
2979 2018-10-16 18:57:27 All I see is producers buying the snake oil from @RCALFUSA that sells a narrative that the industry must be us vs them for us to survuve. This increasing polarity within the industry based around pounding a drum of outrage nationalism is not driving change, just division.
2980 2018-10-16 18:57:20 Short doing well #oott $cl_f #oil $$$, let’s see what happens in 71.75ish area now
2981 2018-10-16 18:57:19 All airlines are having to review their operations as the price of oil rises. Cheap oil fuelled rapid expansion at Wow. Norwegian is also right sizing their operations because of the same reason. LCC's are known to abandon routes which do not look promising rather quickly.
2982 2018-10-16 18:57:10 I am a former soldier. I knew right from the start it was the most stupid idea ever but look at who was promoting it. Farage. Snake oil salesman.
2983 2018-10-16 18:57:00 Not ambitious enough.  You need to remove palm oil from your products.  The politicians and vested interests in Malaysia and Indonesia have had their time.  Help with reforestation.
2984 2018-10-16 18:56:49 Konje what essential oil is used to drive away spiders?? #girltalkza

2986 2018-10-16 18:56:38 Seriously though - what would that accomplish? The end users of our oil will find alternative sources and we’ll impoverish our country by killing a major sector of the economy. Curious how you feel about natural gas? Should we leave that in the ground too?
2987 2018-10-16 18:56:32 No respect for this decision. Utter rubbish when oil companies got what they wanted.
2988 2018-10-16 18:56:30 I just learned how to check my oil . This too much 
2989 2018-10-16 18:56:30 Thank u for speaking truth to corrupt #Saudi power! Don’t let @realDonaldTrump accept bogus excuses from #MBS #KSA + ignore human rights abuses just so he can keep taking their dirty $ and oil.  #JamalKhashoogi #PressFreedom #journalismIsNotACrime
2990 2018-10-16 18:56:27 Ok wait. I think i need a cleansing oil. Im super eager with fresh cleansing oil or hada labo one
2991 2018-10-16 18:56:21 "If someone doesn't like Tesla, they're either paid shills for big oil, or a bot." 

Sound logic, Ross.
2992 2018-10-16 18:56:17 Nothing is impossible.
BruTe force can be countered by BruTe Idea . At knife point , a MaMi asked a chain thief to sit 4 Food & threw chilli powder on his face & poured hot oil on his head
2993 2018-10-16 18:56:16 Looking at the palm oil lasan is giving me headache
2994 2018-10-16 18:56:14 Can you please address how cutting the government staff in half would help the economy? The oil crash cost Alberta 35,000 jobs, which crippled the economy, putting 100,000 (half of the government employees) out of work? Might as well just blow up the province. Kenney is an idiot.
2995 2018-10-16 18:56:12 If they deviate, dont go directly to U.S border.
Ending accepting asylum claims at border, requiring application at consulate and automatic disqualification for illegal entry would go a long way in ending this farcical manipulation, assault on immigration law
2996 2018-10-16 18:56:06 I have an acquaintance going to get treatment for stage 4 cancer from a cannabis doctor today.  It was suggested that the oil could STOP the cancer from progressing...  I have requested more details...
2997 2018-10-16 18:56:03 well if you need one : the shampoo dessange color and hair mask dessange ultra nutritious are really good and i have other things like coconut oil or keratin ect honestly any color shampoo + super nutritious hair mask does the job needed !
2998 2018-10-16 18:55:59 Climbed to the top of an oil derrick structure and swung from it 3 times.
2999 2018-10-16 18:55:52 I live with all that darkness, i feel for you, i will tell you what has helped me, 400 mgs. of magnesium, morning and evening, it quiets your mind and gives you deeper sleep... Probiotics help too, make your digestion perform efficiently.. CBD oil is helpful as well, costly tho.
3000 2018-10-16 18:55:33 Got an oil change without anyone telling me to do it I’m on my grown shit 
3001 2018-10-16 18:55:30 Superb! Let them drink their oil....
3002 2018-10-16 18:55:20 the only essential oil I need is pizza grease
3003 2018-10-16 18:55:16 An essential oil diffuser with lavender oil might help.
3004 2018-10-16 18:55:15 Dura-Bar and Oil and Gas go hand in hand. Head over to booth D7 to find out more. #PBIOS  EngineeredToExcel
3005 2018-10-16 18:55:01 So I made an appointment with my mechanic for an oil change, and when I asked him how much it was he hung up the phone....

3008 2018-10-16 18:54:38 The reality is the leaders of the Middle East have been corrupted by money and power since the colonisation of M.E after first world war and the finding of Oil.
3009 2018-10-16 18:54:34 It’s not about oil. The new Saudi Prince got rid of “a lot “ of the bad guys last fall. Could it be a set-up to make the new Saudi government look BAD? Just an opinion...math exam related@to Vegas?

3016 2018-10-16 18:54:12 AGAIN U R LYING..!  u cannot put too much pressure on Saudi, because they might increase the oil price nd it will affect the coming election and if u do not put pressure on them it affects the coming election too..haha. no way cover it with lying.
3017 2018-10-16 18:54:12 MR President make us completely independent from Saudi oil and export to others so we can detach from these monsters!
3018 2018-10-16 18:54:02 Yea but that will remove at least 50% of ManU trolling of your neighbors. At least our owners are “oil money” yours would be “supporting genocide + oil money”
3019 2018-10-16 18:54:00 Did you try any oil massage techniques, e.g castor oil or phoenician balm?  Thanks

3024 2018-10-16 18:53:30 Mix it on the tile til it’s a smooth consistency. Paint away. Yeah, people seem to love nuln oil, it works great for metal areas. Agrax Earth Shade is a kind of browny wash that I use a lot. I mostly use Vallejo paints as they seem pretty good and much cheaper than GW stuff.
3025 2018-10-16 18:53:25 i always go to the chiropractor and get coconut oil on the paper covering the head rest when i lay face down
3026 2018-10-16 18:53:23 @senatemajldr McConnell is just an old tie snake oil salesman..
3027 2018-10-16 18:53:15 Remember "Peak Oil"?
3028 2018-10-16 18:52:56 It is without doubt that oil is the most energy efficient source, but we need to find the best options that both are energy efficient and not so damaging to the environment at the same time. Some places fracking is the better option; other places, water and wind.
3029 2018-10-16 18:52:53 Wow really?
I heard if you try to dry out your face during your makeup process your skin tries to overcompensate and produces more oil
3030 2018-10-16 18:52:43 They sell The oil In my hometown
3031 2018-10-16 18:52:38 Hahaha oil industry again, not wash wash
3032 2018-10-16 18:52:33 Did Trump discuss the Iran withdrawal with the Saudis?... was it done to increase the oil price as it was too low due to excessive inventories?
3033 2018-10-16 18:52:32 Or we could bring back that old favourite burning in oil. Now some say head first, but to me that just ends the fun too soon. Feet first. Slowly. Now the Muslims got the right idea: burning alive. Nothing like burning a few unbelievers. Can you say BBQ? Beheadings always popular.
3034 2018-10-16 18:52:28 Electricity has a price ceiling which is the amortized cost of solar panels. If hyperinflation hits everywhere then oil / ICE vehicles will be affected as well.

3043 2018-10-16 18:51:03 No Greek would ever say this out loud but it is true. Though Michael Psilakis's cookbook recommends a 9:1 ratio of vegetable oil to olive oil when sauteing. Once he wrote that, I felt like I had permission to stop my olive oil-only cooking.

3045 2018-10-16 18:50:54 The saudis are a huge (in my opinion Jewish mafia) mafia that exploits our military and politics with oil and money. They work hand in hand with Israel and our enemies to extract our support.   and  gang up on Iran.
3046 2018-10-16 18:50:53 Girl I went to get an oil change, lost my student ID, drove around this whole damn city looking for it, waited outside in the cold by my building for someone to walk in so I could get in, and now I’m sitting in some trash auto place getting my window fixed because it cracked 
3047 2018-10-16 18:50:47 If your argument is palm oil isn't vegan because orangutans suffer then neither is soy, corn, wheat, quinoa, cotton, etc especially if you are a consumer only.
3048 2018-10-16 18:50:34 Norway and Scotland are relatively similar in terms of population and oil & gas reserves.  They have a £1.1 trillion Sovereign wealth fund whereas Scotland has record numbers of food bank parcels.  Ask a Unionist why that is

3057 2018-10-16 18:50:00 Use the oil viscosity grade that’s recommended in your owner’s manual for the temperature range for the coming season. Lighter grades often specified for today’s smaller car engines will deliver easier starts and better engine protection in winter and improved gas mileage.

3067 2018-10-16 18:49:20 Oil is my nemesis........so I tend not to trade it, simply doesn't trade the same way as other instruments I make my money on, but reckon order flow is definitely the tool to crack it.

3071 2018-10-16 18:49:05 we need to out law building where gas and oil can be drilled.  it would look much better with out the apartments and other crap buildings
3072 2018-10-16 18:49:02 I threw it away. Couldn’t cope. Eating their reheated “oriental rice” a.k.a. Rice and minced beef in oil.
3073 2018-10-16 18:48:59 Buy arms from USA, otherwise they will buy it from Rusia,together with Israel is our biggest Ally, keeps OPEC countries controlled so that oil prices do not spike.Stick to baseball!!

3076 2018-10-16 18:48:50 It's about oil/gas pipelines and whether saudi arabia/uae/kuwait will have the cheapest routes through:
1) Afghanistan  ...to India & China
2) Syria   ...to EU
3077 2018-10-16 18:48:46 Yes very much so...   never liked the Chelsea and city projects.    But if you can't beat them join them .           # oil money. ....    ..  ps  i include Paris in that as well. ..
3078 2018-10-16 18:48:45 I love my aloe plant. Literally the best facial moisturizer I have ever come across. Even better than coconut oil. And I love my coco oil.
3079 2018-10-16 18:48:44 It's #TriviaTuesday! What are oil exports having a positive impact on?
3080 2018-10-16 18:48:41 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed #TexasDebate
3081 2018-10-16 18:48:35 Snake oil salesman
3082 2018-10-16 18:48:33 We cannot afford to lose Saudis oil while obeying sanctions on Iran.. but on the other hand, does US really have moral high ground to ask countries not buy from Iran when they are not letting blood come in the way if oil??
3083 2018-10-16 18:48:31 Have him give the million dollars he now owes you to the tribes, they can use it to fight the oil pipelines cutting thru their territory.

3086 2018-10-16 18:48:10 I went a few years ago and It was a sad. My flight to Port Harcourt was full of white oil workers. Many of them were bums from Louisiana and Scotland but once in Nigeria, they get treated like kings. Shell has its own mini city within PH which is off limits to local Nigerians
3087 2018-10-16 18:48:05 They aren’t. The highly skilled and objective scientists working in oil and gas, drug and chemicals, manufacturing, automotive, foods and others employed by private sector commercial companies are just as credible. They just aren’t all in the peer reviewed government funded 98%.
3088 2018-10-16 18:47:59 Oh please, every President has gotten in bed with Saudi Arabia since we discovered oil there, to blame 45 for this is just one sided on your part and shows you bias. #Hypocrites
3089 2018-10-16 18:47:50 ^^especially a country that has a history of suppressing oppositions, bombing children in Yemen, supporting radical terrorism, and oh yeah, STILL A MONARCHY IN MODERN TIME. Oh we buy oil from them tho it’s fine
3090 2018-10-16 18:47:47 Its a no win situation from him if you think about it.  If the U.S. came down hard on Saudi Arabia and they retaliated with cutting investments and turning off the oil spigot, the left would blame him for a spike in gasoline prices.
3091 2018-10-16 18:47:44 Lol in other words those complaining about cash should practice barter trade. Get margarine instead of cooking oil? Ride bicycles not kombies?
3092 2018-10-16 18:47:43 The point is people, not economy. And yes it may destabilise Saudi and the US/UK may have to get over their lust for oil. We might have to do something really radical like invest more in renewables so we're not so oil dependant.
3093 2018-10-16 18:47:42 I went for Picnics under duress, I'm pretty sure all the above have palm oil in apart from @GrimReaperInc, maybe he does
3094 2018-10-16 18:47:40 Hey Rick we could slap some of the oil slick on your head add the Red Tide and Algae BLOOM and youd have a Trump wig
3095 2018-10-16 18:47:36 Also, Lloyd and Harry not getting on the bus with bikini models to be their oil boys. That ones tough
3096 2018-10-16 18:47:33 We should have nothing to do with #SaudiArabia. I know we get a lot of our oil from them, but we should consider drilling for oil in Alaska. Plus, we should consider alternate fuel sources. Innovation makes this country great.
3097 2018-10-16 18:47:27 Oil and water don't mix. Neither do flesh and spirit. And one will always rise to the top.  Lord help us to be spirit filled and spirit led. Selah.
3098 2018-10-16 18:47:26 #حمله_نفديك_ياوطن Their war against my Saudi Kingdom is not due to the disappearance of a Saudi-born journalist, #JamalKhashoggi but a war against Saudi #prince_Mohammed binSalman,who stabilized a stable economy and changed a country dependent on oil exports to a manufacturing
3099 2018-10-16 18:47:26 Every everybody in Kentucky wasn't an inbred Oxycontin Junkie McConnell would have been voted out of office long ago he's just a Snake Oil Salesman.!  @GOP
3100 2018-10-16 18:47:10 Sweet beard. I bet you go through a ton of beard oil keeping that bad boy in check.
3101 2018-10-16 18:47:09 I’ve been using aunt Jackie’s products and wild growth oil
3102 2018-10-16 18:46:57 If @WWE cannot continue to business without taking hundreds of millions of dollars from war criminals and oil profiteers they should not continue to do business.
3103 2018-10-16 18:46:57 And a great reason to open up our own oil drilling Cut the feed from Saudi off.
3104 2018-10-16 18:46:56 Really?  We HAVE not down enough already 2 the Native American when we took their land & put them in reservations = Country that now u want to traspax and abuse 4 oil 
3105 2018-10-16 18:46:51 Mechanical engineering would be good for him.
3106 2018-10-16 18:46:36 Well rising crude oil price is issue of concern to US but he thinks that if crude oil rate falls it will benefit to Bharat and china which will challenge to US dominance over globe
3107 2018-10-16 18:46:29 Saudi Arabia has said they will retaliate against sanctions .

I hope they don't retaliate with oil. Global economic nuclear bomb.
3108 2018-10-16 18:46:28 -House of Orange conniving w/ House of Oil
-Three wives (cheating w/the future wife while married to current wife)
-Self-confesses sexual assaulter has 19 women accusers
-Payer of hush$ to porn stars

Does that make Trump a Greedy Sexual Predator, Man-slut or a #PornPresident?
3109 2018-10-16 18:46:27 Honestly, what you've posted up might as well be in an alien language, means absolutely nothing to me, but whatever it was saying worked, lol....have never studied orderflow 'tis in my list of things to do...I'm a traditional pattern/fractal trader, which never works well on Oil!

3111 2018-10-16 18:46:15 He gave me a discount on my oil change 
3112 2018-10-16 18:46:15 Ummm ....did no one tell you that we no longer need your oil?
3113 2018-10-16 18:46:14 Nothing’s gonna happen to Saudi Arabia for that journo’s disappearance and murder. The consequences are too dire for crude oil prices. All the countries that are dependent on Saudi oil will look the other way. Hell, they might just be forced to publicly show support to Riyadh
3114 2018-10-16 18:46:04 Coconut oil is soothing for the soul
3115 2018-10-16 18:45:56 i’m not glowing. i’m greasy. my skin is overproducing oil. thank you.
3116 2018-10-16 18:45:36 Crown Prince is lying. Saudi Arabia is a barbaric theocracy,  not suitable for democracy with the United states. 
Strong sanctions need to be put on this theocracy. If they increase the barrel price of oil we need to hit them hard militarily.
Teach them a righteous lesson.
3117 2018-10-16 18:45:36 SHAPE: Always use an essential oil.
3118 2018-10-16 18:45:36 Good, I was coming over after work anyways to get my oil yo mom made me so I’ll eat some while I’m there 
3119 2018-10-16 18:45:33 Shout out to tea tree oil
3120 2018-10-16 18:45:13 PLEASD LET ME GIFT JIMIN SOME ARGAN OIL SO THAT BLUE HAIR CAN SHINE
3121 2018-10-16 18:45:13 #SaudiArabia Hows $100 $200 oil sound?
They can literary blow up the economy bc
of people like marco rubio & congress
3122 2018-10-16 18:45:12 Translation: I want to believe him bc he gives us $ and oil and we will do a limited investigation so we can say we have proof he wasn't involved. How do corporations have more integrity then our goven't when it comes to Saudi Arabia? #LiarInChief
3123 2018-10-16 18:45:10 A shot of ACV diluted in a full glass of water, every morning. A spoonful of coconut oil every day. High protein and fat, low carbs! And a dog run with me instead of dog walk or let's start exercising daily together lol
3124 2018-10-16 18:45:08 Bet! I have that Argan oil from before i locked my hair but was nervous about using it
3125 2018-10-16 18:45:07 you willing to give up your hot water heater, the oil used to heat the home(s) you have?  the problem is just as much the number of people on the planet and the increasing # of folks seeking first world lifestyles, simple equation, simple math.

3127 2018-10-16 18:45:00 So it wasn't his "expertise as a chemical engineer and oil industry specialist" that GKP found so attractive, then 
3128 2018-10-16 18:44:58 Not exactly true.  They are selling THC&CBD oil which the user can then apply to their food.
3129 2018-10-16 18:44:56 If that were so why are train station and airstrips being built in Africa by the Chinese or foods into the Latino markets and oil and gas east to east

3132 2018-10-16 18:44:46 They are a necessary evil. It’sa jumping point for any Middle East invasion and they give us all the oil.
3133 2018-10-16 18:44:44 OMFG. Anyone who think yesterday was me bitching about recognition clearly didn't get my point. I just don't like the idea of some snake oil salesman lying to people who don't know any better. Really don't give a fuck if Wes recognizes me or not. Doing just fine without it, TBH.
3134 2018-10-16 18:44:38 I reckon a car with 4 engines that power each wheel independantly alongside one of my light thrusters on the back would not just break the #landspeedrecord but it would embarrass it. 

Could be done with electricity and not a drop of oil.

3135 2018-10-16 18:44:18 I need my nails done and my oil changed. Where’s bae?
3136 2018-10-16 18:44:17 I was so pleased when I found the recipe. Added bonuses are ...

* it smells divine

* the lavender helps you sleep AND keeps the mozzies away at night

* the massage oil makes your skin really smooth.

Win-win-win situation

3137 2018-10-16 18:44:17 we called maintenance bc there was something wrong with our burners. He walked in said “it has oil on it just wipe it off” then walked out .
3138 2018-10-16 18:44:15 Im hungry. There is nothin to snack on. I could make popcorn but cooking oil 
3139 2018-10-16 18:44:15 Check his site for all the snake oil he is selling to people, its about as bad as a private group. One thing is giving bad advice, another is charging for it.

3141 2018-10-16 18:44:05 Oh, the hair smells of it.
I was wondering which oil was that.
3142 2018-10-16 18:44:00 As a supporter of yours, I must say, this isn't enough. Saudi Arabia did 9/11. They Saudi royal family should be hung like Saddam, and their oil should be ours.
3143 2018-10-16 18:44:00 I don’t believe it but nobody wants $200 oil
3144 2018-10-16 18:43:54 Well, yeah, but my guess is that it’s probably be harder to do that on a meaningful scale (because it would effectively be a boycott of all oil companies - not necessarily a bad thing ofc but hard to organise in practice) than, say, boycotting a tour by the Israeli Philharmonic

3151 2018-10-16 18:43:18 The Scandinavian countries have had success in that they actually planned out what to do with their wealth & resources before even breaking ground to drill for oil, for example.
3152 2018-10-16 18:43:17 People are already unwrapping the lies around Peter Obi.

Gave Nigerians ID in his state because they're from North.

Didn't leave no N75bn when leaving.

One wristwatch na wash.

One of the economists that ran the economy aground in the midst of oil boom.

Fraud!
3153 2018-10-16 18:43:16 With some kind of essential oil, probably. Only £12.50 per packet!!

3157 2018-10-16 18:42:59 Came to get my oil changed and a peeped a inspections only on Tuesdays and thursdays sign.. Go ahead and SIGN my ass up bc I just realized my tags go out this month.
3158 2018-10-16 18:42:57 Normal fluctuations do not dump thousands of gallons of poisonous fracking waste chemicals into the ocean. Normal fluctuations do not spew fractured pipeline tar sands oil into water supplies etc etc. Man does these things. Republican Men.
3159 2018-10-16 18:42:52 A little oil and heat it face down
3160 2018-10-16 18:42:51 So sick of the Saudis making billions a year for decades off of Western intellectual property and infrastructure in “their” oil industry. Last time I checked camels couldn’t extract oil from thousands of feet beneath the surface. They’d be nothing without us.
3161 2018-10-16 18:42:40 They leak that much in oil hourly
3162 2018-10-16 18:42:37 That cooking oil is still there because the price is inflated , no doubt about that, we know whats on the ground ,mumashops hamun chinhu ,,
3163 2018-10-16 18:42:25 In the end, I'd put my money on the Mohawks, if they sold shares. More than 40 retailers already in business at Tayendenaga alone, selling edibles, kush, hash, hash oil, CBD oil. Weed below govt prices. Government is not selling edibles or hash (at this time). Plus cheap gas.
3164 2018-10-16 18:42:25 The oil cap is loose
3165 2018-10-16 18:42:24 Very important to register @RepMikeJohnson needs to be voted out. He supported an adulterous racist snake oil salesman over good character and morals. The end does not justify the means.

3176 2018-10-16 18:41:44 spoke w/ an expert in international oil  eqpt design) this morning. He says Saudi needs America more than America needs Saudi Arabia. Says Saudi Arabia can't just go buy from other countries as the software won't talk to each other. Like trying to turn an Apple into an Android.

3186 2018-10-16 18:41:08 The U.S Secretary of State is looking at 110 Billions $$$. Even i would be smiling at 'it'.
Would i really care if a Saudi King kills one of his own people as long as we get paid in $ and oil?

This is where U.N becomes a joke to me.
3187 2018-10-16 18:41:06 Went for an oil change and ended up getting my brakes done... Hell really gotta be a cool -5° below if I'm letting mechanics fix other shit.
3188 2018-10-16 18:40:54 A p.r. person for an oil and gas company has to be one of the easiest jobs you can have for that reason. Never gotten anything out of a single one.

3194 2018-10-16 18:40:14 no, i'm talking about the terrible argument that started all this, which is to nationalize oil reserves and use them to fund social programs, but it's OK because we'll geoengineer later to undo all the damage
3195 2018-10-16 18:40:14 Off to get an oil change, hit the market to send Thanksgiving meals to my Sailor and his shop,  floating in the sea. hoping I can find canned Turkey, not likely .... Ham will work though. 
Never forget the tens of thousands away from home..... Holidays are hard on them.
3196 2018-10-16 18:40:08 No they were not played, they decided gladly to play all the way for money, of which they are subsuming lots and lots. War Tax dollars, Oil = Money is all that matters. We all know what the mob does, #TrumpCrimeFamily out shines any crime syndicate anywhere, so far.

3203 2018-10-16 18:39:45 They expect oil prices to sink, because Pompeo told them that's the punishment for killing Khasoggi.
3204 2018-10-16 18:39:44 it’s that time of year your coconut oil starts coagulating & u gotta run it under hot water to get what’s left at the bottom of the jar :\
3205 2018-10-16 18:39:38 @Jimmy_Durrr @washingtonpost @jimmy_dore is so dumb, he refused to vote for incrementalism, and oil funded dems!

3212 2018-10-16 18:38:41 Oil spills, pipeline explosions, sink holes: they ALL destroy our environment, wildlife, endanger communities, ALL the signs are there, but greedy humans don't learn. #TimeForChange #RenewableEnergy
3213 2018-10-16 18:38:40 My hair growth oil will be available for purchase as well my detangle must. Follow me @BeverlyBoots on Instagram to stay updated. 
3214 2018-10-16 18:38:38 Take it...sell off each subsidiary, redistribute the income back to the employees paychecks, and effectively break up amazon into various independant companies.....AKA what congress did with Standard Oil in the 30s and with AT&T in the early 80s
3215 2018-10-16 18:38:33 Consumers could also choose not to buy places they know to use those production processes. As of fracking, isn't that better than using fossil fuels like coal and oil? Not a preferable substitute?
3216 2018-10-16 18:38:22 Saudi Arabia said they’ll push oil prices to $150+ if countries levy economic sanctions in response to the killing of the Saudi journalist.
3217 2018-10-16 18:38:06 So many beneficial uses for coconut oil. Gotta love it!
3218 2018-10-16 18:38:03 Hot oil got on my ear...how? Idk
3219 2018-10-16 18:37:59 Having a luxury car is nice until you have to be $70+  for an oil change.
3220 2018-10-16 18:37:52 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed #TexasDebate
3221 2018-10-16 18:37:49 "Okay so we agree, you don't accuse us of torturing, murdering and dismembering journalist and we keep giving you oil.  Good deal?  Hahahahahahahahah!"
3222 2018-10-16 18:37:49 Russia is helped by high oil prices. Saudis, Exxon too. There are a lot of entanglements we don't know or understand. Those seeking to get the oil from the shale need it high too as it is an expensive process. We do not know all the players in these games
3223 2018-10-16 18:37:49 And are you being paid to discuss oil profits with me ? Because you’re awful at it.
3224 2018-10-16 18:37:47 Oil ?
3225 2018-10-16 18:37:35 Well that’s it then, no more Lindt chocolates until they stop using palm oil. Why on earth does chocolate need palm oil anyway
3226 2018-10-16 18:37:34 I meant Louie.  Can't put no PB in the ice box but ketchup is a must.

Then again, yall got that crazy PB with all the oil rolling around.  Skippy keeps it cool in the cupboard.
3227 2018-10-16 18:37:31 Things like fuel, @Golden_Boi84 , cooking oil, etc they're hard to get hold of yoh! 
3228 2018-10-16 18:37:29 tiddie milk is the BOMB i use it for EVERYTHING it’s like self made coconut oil
3229 2018-10-16 18:37:27 But for oil, the US has no common interest with Saudi Arabia. Energy considerations have driven diastrous foreign policy decisions.
3230 2018-10-16 18:37:14 Oil?

3233 2018-10-16 18:36:38 There has been some leakage over the years, but it hasn't damaged the atoll. When RMI decided they had to stop seepage of fuel oil, they requested technical & financial assistance in 2010. It took several yrs to complete assessments & planning & for Congress to allocate funding.

3237 2018-10-16 18:35:52 The NPR reporting I heard said that Chinese companies are just hedging against possible tariffs on oil. The oil is still selling, though, to other buyers.
3238 2018-10-16 18:35:50 Oil first, my friend !
3239 2018-10-16 18:35:46 if jimin would dye his hair black, regularly get his hair cut, put some argan oil in it it could PROSPER but no! he holds on to the the fried blond like it’s final 
3240 2018-10-16 18:35:42 According to the red necks in the @GOP, it is the color of your skin and the fact they have demonized Middle Easterners as all being terrorists. But more likely it’s about raiding their oil.

3243 2018-10-16 18:35:29 Reading book from 2016..Strangers In Their Own Land. About1/3 in. Louisiana chemical oil dependence. Folks dependence for jobs. Seems to be a fair, kindly look so far on politics, beliefs in spite of pollutions and losses
3244 2018-10-16 18:35:26 The period u people now refer to oil boom crude oil sold for 115 dollars Nigerians still bought fuel at 87 naira. So what is is your riddle all about?
3245 2018-10-16 18:35:26 Congrats Dodge ... Only HEMI claim for fame is that even new HEMIs burn oil.  Try driving behind one

3247 2018-10-16 18:35:13 Just come to India once,the government here compensates for its blunders through the rise in oil prices.
They are literally skyrocketing..!!
3248 2018-10-16 18:35:09 please for the love of god. i was raised by a koreaboo so i only know how to broil things in sesame oil
3249 2018-10-16 18:35:09 A coworker just swung by and offered me some lavender oil, and I honestly have never been so glad to live in the Bay Area. I needed that hippy-dippy ass shit.

3251 2018-10-16 18:34:59 Think about this too... Where does Russia get money? Same place as Saudi Arabia.... Same place as Bush... Oil. Who was DJT's 1st sect of State? An oilman? Hmmm.... You don't say. The war in Iraq was deemed Operation Iraqi Liberation.... OIL.
3252 2018-10-16 18:34:58 Sampai sekarang teringat bau essential oil dkt young living tuh. Terus skit kepala bau dye. 
3253 2018-10-16 18:34:50 Totally depends on the kind of peanut butter you eat...

Natural peanut butter should be refrigerated to prevent the separation of the oils. While something like Skippy does not need to worry about oil separation because of the type of fat used is hydrogenate
3254 2018-10-16 18:34:48 No, "principal." Clearly, as a paid representative of Big Oil, I have no principles. It's principal I care about.
3255 2018-10-16 18:34:44 Girl I know a Normal car is but I found out recently my car only uses ethanol and I’ve been putting gasoline in it for months. So I gotta give it that good good oil 
3256 2018-10-16 18:34:44 Ugh. Listen. The Koch bros funneled vast sums toward the anti XL Pipeline expansion as they own an enormous number of the train cars that transport the very same oil!! Americans get ripped at the pump they pay 40C on the $ at CND wells!
3257 2018-10-16 18:34:44 Done put on all this coconut oil now I’m sweating 
3258 2018-10-16 18:34:43 couldn’t be me, tea tree oil is really good for your skin though
3259 2018-10-16 18:34:33 Le gouvernement et ses députés pourront bien dire tant qu'ils veulent que les impots baissent, tant que l'essence et le gas oil augmenteront quasi quotidiennement, leur impact sera nul... et vivement l'augmentation de 4 et 7 centimes au 1er janvier 2019 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3260 2018-10-16 18:34:23 I’m more interested in Lindsey being on the take from big oil money.
3261 2018-10-16 18:34:22 Don't forget the oil.
3262 2018-10-16 18:34:20 It will hurt EU and Asia but not the US. They are in far better position. Using oil weapon is like shooting ourself in the foot
3263 2018-10-16 18:34:18 @Rajbibifazal 18th Amendment gave powers to provinces to generate electricity,explore oil & gas etc

3265 2018-10-16 18:34:12 Not heard the podcast yet Jon, that will be later tonight, the Saudi's are deinitely our enemies. Their sole intent is to turn Britain into a M*slim Country and to that end they have funded the building of thousands of mosques. Sadly due to oil,  our 'leaders' are helping them.
3266 2018-10-16 18:34:02 @SenateGOP confirmed oil giant BP lawyer who defended lawsuits over the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill as Trump’s top environmental lawyer.

3271 2018-10-16 18:33:42 Just a question. So, if someone offers me some pills (and I voluntarily take them) I can still say it was their fault  for giving them to me? Because I was offered castor oil for years and...
3272 2018-10-16 18:33:36 Oh I'm very concerned. But that's nothing but gossip column stuff covering up the *actual problem: a growing oligarchy destroying our economy and planet for short term oil profits...and *that concerns both our countries. But you knew that:)

3275 2018-10-16 18:33:30 Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed says,  “We are strong and old allies.”  We are not allies of the Saudis. We are addicts. Saudi oil is America’s heroin. Trump will gladly pimp our ass.

3283 2018-10-16 18:32:57 This. People, for some reason, think we get most of our oil from Saudi Arabia still, when the fact is we’re now the 3rd largest oil producing country in the world and only import about 9% of our oil consumption from them.

3289 2018-10-16 18:32:19 @narendramodi @RNTata2000 @maruti_corp   One of the permanent way to fight against inflation cause by crued oil is to make car like tesla.
3290 2018-10-16 18:32:17 The things I had to do to film the new video...I had to put the straight part of the tripod in an olive oil bottle to hold it up while it was facing down and surround the olive oil bottle with large candles so it didnt tip over  totally macgyver'd it

3302 2018-10-16 18:31:37 CBD oil is only a 'drug' if you also consider ibuprofen a drug.

Let's stop it with the stigma please. I know you guys get bored and like to pick on eachother but it's not really worth it 

I could go on but luckily Twitter has a character limit 
3303 2018-10-16 18:31:26 The more oil they need

3307 2018-10-16 18:31:02 The United States is an oil exporting nation.
3308 2018-10-16 18:30:57 Hello @GreenPeaceUSA , what is your stance on Nuclear power to help the world move away from coal oil and gas? - isn't it time to act fast and do all we can?

3311 2018-10-16 18:30:53 LISTEN! I would recommend pouring coconut oil into your ear and let it sit overnight and then wash out the wax.
3312 2018-10-16 18:30:52 No one is better off with the exception of the one percent.
Go sell your snake oil somewhere else.
3313 2018-10-16 18:30:51 The Saudi’s have this country over a barrel. We are so dependent on there oil that they are going to get away with Murder!!
3314 2018-10-16 18:30:50 Sugar was once a valuable commodity. Majority of the slaves were taking to sugar plantations. In fact the economy of many world powers was built and run by sugar plantations. It was the "oil" then

3327 2018-10-16 18:30:22 But they produce oil, so governments look the other way.

3332 2018-10-16 18:30:01 Every day in office, more damage done. More Zinke wannabes, who think it is a national security issue if the US doesn’t rip from the ground every last drop of oil and ounce of coal.
3333 2018-10-16 18:29:51 Those were her exact words. She grabbed my arm and said ohhh i have to see her (referring to my tattooeveb though there is two mermaids) then said oh that’s hysterical... very funny. Then she let go of my arm and i continued to serve her bread and oil
3334 2018-10-16 18:29:47 It's time to end all Saudi oil imports and all weapons sales to brutal regimes who don't place value on freedom of speech and human life. No amount of money is worth that compromise (though Trump likely won't understand)
3335 2018-10-16 18:29:29 I hope that Jimin's dye had an oil treatment
3336 2018-10-16 18:29:28 We also need to legalize weed federally and Idk what job I’m blocking by saying this BUT cannabis has been the only thing to work quickly and effectively when my demon cramps pop up...Best gift I got myself was THC oil for cramps in Vegas but no I gotta push through 
3337 2018-10-16 18:29:26 If the @EdmontonOilers does come away with a win tonight in the ‘Peg, I think the Oil have been a much team from last year and this would be a promising bounce back season. #LetsGoOilers
3338 2018-10-16 18:29:18 I’ll never forget the guy explaining to his girlfriend how to do an oil change. His opening line was, “To start with, you have to drill a hole into the engine block.”
3339 2018-10-16 18:29:17 While I don’t advocate using oil as a weapon, a cut off of Saudi oil, even if it only represents 5% will have to be replaced from somewhere else. Wherever that place is, they will have to divert sales from existing customers who will have to come to Saudi for that oil.
3340 2018-10-16 18:29:16 If a few countries can support India by accepting payments of oil in ₹, they will show their true friendship. A friend in need is a friend indeed.
3341 2018-10-16 18:29:15 You know it’s winter in LA when your coconut oil finally solidifies again.
3342 2018-10-16 18:29:14 Tearing down "silos" sounds like a good idea, but too much collaboration can bring endless meetings, debates and a struggle to execute quickly. Collaboration becomes not the oil greasing the wheel but the sand grinding it to a halt. #GreatAtWork
3343 2018-10-16 18:29:10 .@SenRichAlloway: Rolling back protections from oil & gas pollution with this lobbyist-fueled bill in the final days of the legislative session is an affront to PA families and a giveaway to industry special interests. #HB2154

3348 2018-10-16 18:28:54 It is very rare for me to agree with Owen Jones but on this matter I do. Every word. 
Saudi Arabia’s main export isn’t oil- it is is extremism, terrorism and death.

3355 2018-10-16 18:27:33 Question: When are we going to stop pandering to the Saudis?
Answer: When they have no more oil and the US stops making money selling them weapons.

3357 2018-10-16 18:27:17 Apparently coconut oil is amazing for hair. Cool, well, I need help. When the hell is it appropriate to apply coconut oil to your hair? Before or after a shower. Also how long do you leave it applied for? Half an hour or hour? How many times should one apply the oil?
3358 2018-10-16 18:27:13 Car update: it was just the battery. They're replacing that, changing my oil, and cleaning out my car. 
My friend is on her way to pick me up & take me to pick up my car.

3360 2018-10-16 18:26:45 Care to explain your 2015 tweet in which you say that Saudis spend millions of dollars buying apartments from you? You are a fraud and a conman. It saddens me that so many people in this country are willing to sell their souls for your brand of snake oil.
3361 2018-10-16 18:26:45 What did they do to it when it went that place coz I'm having to check oil and coolant everytime I drive it

3364 2018-10-16 18:26:14 Riddle me this. If Fuel price was N145 per litre when crude was selling for $30, now that crude price is $71 dollars do you expect the price of oil to remain the same? Given that the industry is semi regulated!!

3367 2018-10-16 18:25:48 What's the end point of this strategy? UK/US withdraws support, Saudi regime significantly weakens. External enemies, including IS & other extremists are emboldened and destabilise Saudi. Oil prices skyrocket, leading to instability and economic crises across the globe.

3371 2018-10-16 18:25:39 Excuse me, but between climate action, carbon pricing that has already helped new innovation in oil and gas: a pipeline project, and solar subsidies, where is the "disregard" you're seeing, let alone the "complete" disregard? They seem plenty engaged.
3372 2018-10-16 18:25:38 We need to cut ties with the Saudis & impose sanctions. Yes, I know what I’m saying and how expensive it would be. They have murdered over 3,000 Americans. A legal permanent resident is an American. This is long overdue. Fuck their oil and fuck their money. Humans r more imp.
3373 2018-10-16 18:25:28 Iran is the 5th largest oil producer in the world, behind the US, Saudi Arabia, Russia, and Canada. They have the 4th largest proven reserves. I would trade Iran for Saudi Arabia in a heartbeat.
3374 2018-10-16 18:25:25 Wish u put a full stop somewhere before you got to the last part. Let's stop shitting on service.
Carpentry, oil changer, pumping tyre and a lot of other services are not as difficult either but we pay. It's not about how easy, you'd just never be able to do everything yourself.
3375 2018-10-16 18:25:18 It's fall and the weather in the North East is getting colder so fuel prices naturaly rise as more people start use to a oil to heat their homes.

3385 2018-10-16 18:23:42 Yes we need people who have used cbd oil to let us know how much they used and what type/brand. What levels of thc were in it. I believe the cbd used to treat epilepsy has a higher dosage above 0.3% . A good question and as it continues to be made available we will learn more

3393 2018-10-16 18:22:56 So what is wrong w  this? As a businessman, should he hve refused 2 sell 2 certain groups? We R a nation of capitalists. So what’s wrong with the Saudi’s? We can ONLY PAY THEM FOR THEIR OIL? Which we’ve been doing for how long? THEY can only have received our money not buy fm us?
3394 2018-10-16 18:22:43 CBRE Q3 Press Lunch: Michael Thompson, capital markets are healthy, but also cautious on underwriting #Houston. As oil and gas recovers, we've seen lenders who were sitting on the sideline jump back into the market.
3395 2018-10-16 18:22:35 @BritishGas hive system can’t be fitted by your engineers to an oil system because they’re not qualified . Could have easily been weeded out when ordering online not clear at all. Lost half a days work to be told in 2 seconds it can’t be done. Thanks for nothing. Utter farce 
3396 2018-10-16 18:22:35 And no matter how hard you scream about it , next delivery of weapons will go ahead, we still need oil, and haven't enough politicians with a conscience to change it. On either side...money rules as always.
3397 2018-10-16 18:22:11 That wont happen. USA will not let KSA down the drain, if KSA stops asking for dollars for their oil then US economy collapses.
3398 2018-10-16 18:22:03 Big Oil goes and so will Big Federal Bucks... which will cost EVERY Alaskan. What EXACTLY does this proposition propose aside from a ton of wild accusations from both yeas and nays!? Confusing!

3430 2018-10-16 18:19:13 Think about what Venezuela was like when oil production took off, in the 1920s. 

We were a 19th century style dictatorship. 

Virtually everyone was illiterate. 

Only a tiny elite went to High School, say nothing about university.

Most people got malaria several times a year.
3431 2018-10-16 18:19:12 I personally like Young Living. Their Thieves line is AMAZING for getting rid of germs, antibacterial cleaners, purifying your air. It works so well and there is no chemicals. And the Theives comes in oil, a dietary oil, hand cleaner, household cleaner, etc.

3440 2018-10-16 18:18:19 I think this is different. Trump and Kushner need the Saudis. I'm not so sure the American people do. There are other sources of oil. The Kingdom will never assist with Israel, Iran, ME in general. They buy our weapons to kill Yemeny children. No arms sale, institute Magnitsky!

3445 2018-10-16 18:18:05 Time to diversify, plenty of places have no oil and a strong economy. The 2 don’t go hand in hand.

Whoops-think I’v blown it #Saudigreatstate
3451 2018-10-16 18:17:51 Please do let us know if you find an alternative... palm oil is used in far too many items & food... such a destructive, unnecessary substance! 
3452 2018-10-16 18:17:44 I suggest that we work on refinery than removing subsidy on oil. We cant afford the landing cost. For you points on education and health, thats incontrovertible. But is it really a case of people not having requisite skills to work? I think the problems are deeper that that
3453 2018-10-16 18:17:38 Horrible guy. We can;t sustain a global military trillion dollar a year force for nothing. I don;t care if Iran or Venezuela sell oil. Stop military spending and stop talking about cutting important things.

3467 2018-10-16 18:17:03 haha no no you have that backwards, the best way to reduce dependence is to stop flooding the market with expensive oil at a loss, let the supply dry up and the massive price increase to stop demand... you don't need a single carrot or stick

3471 2018-10-16 18:16:40 That's a joke right? The US are now net exporters of oil and are weening themselves from Lisa's oil. Furthermore, history does not bestow power. Which you should be glad, as Saudia history is like 100 years.
3472 2018-10-16 18:16:37 I would love that I mean u can change it anytime and use coconut oil before u color it

3475 2018-10-16 18:16:32 lmao I have yet to try either but I know as I am is pricey. honestly, I don't use products that are geared towards natural hair. I use infusium shampoo and conditioner & nairobi leave-in with oil from ogx & gel
3476 2018-10-16 18:16:31 not until you realize your oil change dang near $200 
3477 2018-10-16 18:16:26 When the oil runs out I wonder if world leaders attitudes will change to their barbaric regime?
3478 2018-10-16 18:16:25 So, in the past two weeks, my wife and I have both gotten free oil changes due to service fails. Nobody is winning in these situations.
3479 2018-10-16 18:16:24 I has an oil change yesterday now my dash is all in French really?
3480 2018-10-16 18:16:16 Yeah but the US is far more interested in selling them guns to kill children with than their oil.
3481 2018-10-16 18:16:14 My oil is fine, emissions also fine. Its diesel, so prob some nasties coming out, but just not worth spending money i don't have on a car i don't need. I'll wait until the price of cleaner cars has come down.

3483 2018-10-16 18:16:05 Bought eucalyptus oil and now my room smells half-spa half-lola of Manila. And I’m at that state where I can’t tell if I’m awake. Like I took melatonin but I’m pretty sure I skipped that tonight.
3484 2018-10-16 18:15:49 .. I was forced to cook my stir fry with oil
3485 2018-10-16 18:15:47 Also, with no water I can’t work on my bike, which needs its 1000mile maintenance because I can’t shower or wash oil off my hands. So, yeah.

3494 2018-10-16 18:15:02 Oil price volatility is another reason to move away from oil.  A move from the oil cartel to up the price of a barrel of oil to USD 400 can be taken as a repeat of the oil crisis of the 70's.  No more petro-dollars!
3495 2018-10-16 18:14:44 It was a natural gas pipeline, not oil, no damage to environment.
Community is not in danger and the gas line is repaired. Get your facts straight.
3496 2018-10-16 18:14:35 will palm oil ever achieve an ethical position?

does coconut oil have the same problems as palm oil?

lard, gee, butter and other saturated animal fats all have problems if ur vegan.
3497 2018-10-16 18:14:34 I’m confused about oil. I heard China is no longer buying our exported oil. Canada is building more pipe lines to ship us oil. A war and other protected areas are being exploited for oil. Why do we need ME oil???
3498 2018-10-16 18:14:30 This is a trash cash-grab from IGN, you don't need all this weird booster snake oil crap and it will assuredly use up your PCs resources while providing little to no benefit.

3502 2018-10-16 18:14:13 For the record I am registered Republican and fiscal conservative, AND I know how to do math. The onus is on the oil and gas industry to step up or bow out.
3503 2018-10-16 18:14:12 These numbers are total bs.  Almost all of the "oil subsidies" relate to immediate expending of some costs, accelerated depreciation,  arbitrarily stating that royalties (a tax) are too low, the use of MLPs (also used in other sectors) to avoid corporate income tax, use of LIFO
3504 2018-10-16 18:14:00 Finally getting an oil change ! Hallelujah lol
3505 2018-10-16 18:13:58 Saudi Arabia has already done enough to us, I consider cutting oil production an act of war.

3510 2018-10-16 18:13:28 But, OIL MAN, OIL!!
3511 2018-10-16 18:13:13 Oil is the traditional reason, but now we have a president who has powerful personal business connections to the Saudis. The Bushes were also in deep with the Saudis....perhaps they still are.
3512 2018-10-16 18:13:08 Pipelines don’t pay people- but trucking, that pays people.

This could be the Northern Oil Boys way of saying “let in the American truckers and support native rights to land”.

In return, we should really quit being dicks to Canadians at the border.

It takes trust, remember!?
3513 2018-10-16 18:13:05 Hey liz. You should introduce gas pump labeling. Let Americans decide if they want to buy Saudi oil.
3514 2018-10-16 18:13:03 30 years in oil, I know the threat of oil and how powerful they are, what you fail to account for is people, they are NOT all sheep

My only question is then, what other drugs didn’t you do for your neck pain before trying CBD oil?
3529 2018-10-16 18:11:42 Which oil?

3568 2018-10-16 18:09:01 Saudi Arabia has the most radical mosques in the Arab World.  Best thing the United States could do for world security would be to get off of oil and into renewables and let this dictatorship sink back into the sand ...

3571 2018-10-16 18:08:54 I thought I read about Saudi oil running low almost a year ago...maybe even longer. Not much of a weapon if ya sold it all.
3572 2018-10-16 18:08:51 The best way to stick it to the Saudi regime, Venezuelan dictators and Iran is to create a world run on renewable energy.  All their evil power and ability to control the economy will disappear.  Canada exports more oil than we import.  All we have to do is reduce our consumption
3573 2018-10-16 18:08:50 Trump is in a bit of a pickle with this Saudi thing. Do nothing and he looks weak and we know how he hates that but if the Saudi government is willing to go full nuclear with their oil then sanctions fuck all of us.

3576 2018-10-16 18:08:34 :)) Saudis, I want you be advised, The oil will not save you forever. And never come to my beautiful country ever again.

3579 2018-10-16 18:08:13 The problem is oil, oil, oil, OIL! All our nastiest problems come from OIL! What are you doing today to move away from the use of OIL? If you say the word OIL too many times it gets weird! I HATE OIL

3581 2018-10-16 18:07:23 Because wealthy nations are never interested in the real suffering of small nations without oil or stregic importance. They say they are but their not. The number of ethnic cleansing and humanitarian disasters in the last 30 years is a stain on the UN and the wider world.

I’d rather give up driving sell our democratic values for oil.
3590 2018-10-16 18:06:27 Yeah totally fake flooding in Toronto which almost drown two men in an elevator...no clean up needed at all in flooded basements...oil is always a polluter and we are negative because we have a cap on how much carbon business can produce before paying a penalty...cap and trade.

3596 2018-10-16 18:05:54 climate change is 100% human caused via burning oil, gas and coal. an all EV transport system actually 85% less costly than inefficient FF. Energy generation via photons to electrons can boost world wide standard of living per capita by 1000% because photons are infinite.

3601 2018-10-16 18:05:23 This is so sadd! I bought ufo oil twice hoping it was the cure and i honestly never saw a difference in my skin it was angrier if anything but i kept using it bc everyone swore by it

3603 2018-10-16 18:05:12 You want one more try at that??
3604 2018-10-16 18:05:11 It wasn't clear in your reply.  Are you suggesting the US doesn't need arms deals and oil from the Sauds?
3605 2018-10-16 18:05:04 Consuming oil is your vote to maintain relationships with the saudis.
3606 2018-10-16 18:04:58 I have a bottle of UFO oil on my desk getting dusty because of Curology lol. More people need to know!!
3607 2018-10-16 18:04:54 You know we don't actually need their oil, It's only 10% of all Oil that we import. and we have a lot of natural oil in Texas and Alaska.
3608 2018-10-16 18:04:50 Oil change out the way. Now it’s time to do this homework
3609 2018-10-16 18:04:45 I ate noodles last night & I flicked red chili oil specks all over my brand new light pink hoodie & im fucking SAD! about it  
3610 2018-10-16 18:04:44 Coconut oil ? Lol
3611 2018-10-16 18:04:38 We need independence from oil so the #Saudis can't threaten to raise oil to $200 a barrel. Let them drink their oil...
3612 2018-10-16 18:04:37 Why are you holding oil and petroleum ministry you r just enjoying..not have any controll over fuel prices
3613 2018-10-16 18:04:37 bro i literally just started talking to you-- jkimsorry I'm guessing Walmart oil changes isn't as amazing as their low prices are?
3614 2018-10-16 18:04:05 No more oil!! We don’t need it! Technology exists to fix this bullshit!

3617 2018-10-16 18:03:51 I put castor oil around my sinus area to see what would happen and I just blew these chunks of blood out my nose
3618 2018-10-16 18:03:51 Then you tell him you’ll cut off the cheap oil and then he sells you billions military equipment.
3619 2018-10-16 18:03:36 @AldiUK I was disappointed to find ALL bread products in my local store contain #palm oil . No matter how ‘sustainable’ destroys #rainforest
3620 2018-10-16 18:03:32 it’s ironic that ari retweeted that cos i can actually see ari using baby oil to cook
3621 2018-10-16 18:03:27 But nearly everyone is skint and hungry now and that's equality in a nation with huge oil reserves. Quality example of socialism off paper.
3622 2018-10-16 18:03:23 It is estimated that approximately 7.7% (130,138bpd) of the current oil production in the Gulf of Mexico remains shut-in. It is also estimated that approximately 3.5 percent of the natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico remains shut-in.

3623 2018-10-16 18:03:20 Try @clinique take the day off cleansing balm, @tatcha_v camellia cleansing oil, or @loccitaneusa Shea cleansing oil... all of these are BOMB at removing makeup and never irritate my eyes!
3624 2018-10-16 18:03:12 I put my makeup wipe between my eyelids, shut my eyes a little bit, and then rub & it normally gets all of the mascara off my the bottoms of my lashes and stuff. Or you could use coconut oil and q-tips. They also have cream makeup remover!
3625 2018-10-16 18:03:12 Look at your words. You talk about Saudi Arabia, which has the Holy Land, where more than a billion Muslims from all over the world pray for it. They will never accept any aggression against Saudi Arabia, Iran or others and do not forget oil.
3626 2018-10-16 18:03:09 Thanks Martha, I got through my act tonight, with the help of ginger and lemon and some essential oil!!
3627 2018-10-16 18:02:58 And you have for us; like Jesus did for all; such an example of a Christian heart! BTW Jesus got furious with the money changers and threw furniture, so Trump is mild mannered in comparison! So just think about that!
3628 2018-10-16 18:02:45 You’re both second (okay, third) rate. You’re a slime bucket, snake oil salesman, Michael, and you’re gross, Stormy. Just gross. You both loved the President’s Tweet as it gives you another taste of the spotlight for a few seconds. A spotlight that quickly burned out on you two.

3631 2018-10-16 18:02:39 I took my car to get an oil change I told them high miles synthetic Castrol oil 5-20 because what’s what the car takes it’s been 3 hours and they put penzoil 5-30 like..... how do you mess that up and make me wait that long
3632 2018-10-16 18:02:23 Pardon of sin and love of sin are like oil and water...they will never go together.  All who are washed in the blood of Christ, are also sanctified by the Spirit of Christ.

3633 2018-10-16 18:02:03 Well said @OwenJones84 but the oil sucking governments of Britain and America have always valued oil more than their own citizens. Money talks and humans don’t matter. Time and time again.

3639 2018-10-16 18:01:35 @SullyCNBC Brian how do they get the oil off the rig, pipes or ship?
3640 2018-10-16 18:01:16 He is our Country's Sheriff!
3641 2018-10-16 18:01:10 GOP: socialism is evil in itself and we will never cease fighting it in all its forms.
also GOP: you know how in Venezuela and Iran, those socialist hellholes, the military is involved in the oil industry? yeah, we'd like to do that here.
3642 2018-10-16 18:01:10 They should be more concerned with republicans suppressing their vote Or republicans stealing their land for oil pipes
3643 2018-10-16 18:00:53 Same. I love the overpriced blue retinol oil otherwise known as Luna.
3644 2018-10-16 18:00:44 The only thing inspires trumppence is money, he could care less about human lives. So don't get ur hopes on him retaliating against a dictator who's stockpiling his secret offshore bank accounts, unless it's for 1 of his rich donors oil. Traitor treasonous trump HATES Americans!

3647 2018-10-16 18:00:32 I wasn't talking about fuel consumption. Old worn engines burn oil and pollute much more, burnt oil means emissions are higher, it's what killed off production of 2 stroke bikes.
3648 2018-10-16 18:00:28 The thing is - my pal - that this is Twitter-sphere, where incompetence is awarded with popularity and competence if often a drag more than a booster.

3657 2018-10-16 17:59:32 Who would care .. your money to do as you please .. we all need better futures .. so if investing or even buying out them in oil fields or others interests .. is in our best interest. We need to do it . Profit from a stranger is better than being put in debt by a friend ..
3658 2018-10-16 17:59:24 I have pasted my window sills in citrus oil (the little blighters hate the smell) and they are staying away! Felt like I was going straight to hell with hoovering them up all the time 
3659 2018-10-16 17:59:20 How much oil would that be? That would be all of it throughout the world I think. We’re on top due to the “Petrodollar”! Stakes are so high! I think our past government has tied are hands. Good luck POTUS!
3660 2018-10-16 17:59:18 I am 15 days in and breaking out now. Hoping it is detox phase and will clear out since I have 3 bottles with me. On the bright side, my oil production is in control
3661 2018-10-16 17:59:18 Mmmmmmm, Yea Bruv, That smell of two stroke oil is an always will be A RUSH to the nostrils! I owned 5 two strokes back in the day, I loved everyone of them! Ha ha. Obviously they sounded far better than they rode! 
3662 2018-10-16 17:59:15 My coconut oil is solidifying! Winter is coming.
3663 2018-10-16 17:59:09 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
3664 2018-10-16 17:59:03 Sharing #cbdoil is one of my favorite jobs. The oil is to be shared with people who need it and we need to do everything to get it to them. We can help you earn free oil or cash with nothing upfront and mo minimums. We are is this to help people. Not recruit.
3665 2018-10-16 17:59:01 I gotta get my oil change today  damnit! I wanted to race home too!!!
3666 2018-10-16 17:58:57 Did you miss our oil sands in your biggest polluters rant...and losing money from the feds means you are going to be paying more in taxes for clean up, money the 3 billion from the Feds would have helped with. Now it is on Ontario to pay.
3667 2018-10-16 17:58:41 Don't forget about the threat of OIL.  Not ramping up production.
3668 2018-10-16 17:58:28 Im 30 dog, I dont want any Omega Oil, Kitty Milk, PJ, Blue juice None of that, If I cant see whats in it I dont want it
3669 2018-10-16 17:58:22 It it just straight vegetable oil?
3670 2018-10-16 17:58:17 Basically needs an engine rebuild. Oil leaks everywhere.
3671 2018-10-16 17:58:07 Why and how? I'm a #Texas resident, and @SenTedCruz has done nothing for education, healthcare, or any other human necessities. His only concern is the oil and gas industry and the #NRA.
3672 2018-10-16 17:58:01 I use some rose water and glycerin and then rub a little aloe with argan oil
3673 2018-10-16 17:57:58 Mike Pompeo isn't the true power broker in this scenario & he's not calling any of the shots. The Saudis have controlled the spin on the Khashoggi from top to bottom, & will keep control until the end. The US bows down to its Saudi masters in exchange for oil concessions. #oil

3675 2018-10-16 17:57:52 How can a case of sugar be $28 and a case of cooking oil $48. How much does the average Zimbabwean earn? If you factor in transport, rentals & basic commodities. #Zimbabwe #crisis @MthuliNcube @CurateZim #nvm medicals which now require forex. #crymybelovedcountry
3676 2018-10-16 17:57:51 Sugar & coconut oil rub lol
3677 2018-10-16 17:57:51 Just one of several reasons that getting our economy to green, renewable energy sources is geo-strategic. Yes, domestic production is ok as a short-term gap, but once we can get the majority of our energy from renewables then our troops don't have to fight for oil anymore.
3678 2018-10-16 17:57:41 i tried it last year but i kept removing it uncorrectly n it hurted so bad i HAD to stop or i wouldve no skin left... now imma try removing it w oil, ill tell u how it goes!!
3679 2018-10-16 17:57:31 Just realised I never told you guys how I love your coconut oil lol..

I love how my hair feels whenever I use it  thanks!!
3680 2018-10-16 17:57:23 What gas companies buy Saudi oil? I'd rather not give my money to those murderers.

3682 2018-10-16 17:57:19 A lack of an amount of oil will shut down western civilisation.
3683 2018-10-16 17:57:12 Stay away from canola oil and 'vegetable' oil. Olive n coconut oil the way to go primoo. You can get fancy with ya avocado or walnut oil too
3684 2018-10-16 17:57:01 The Saudis have oil, and we've had many environmental studies recently, the Saudis are the main reason why the electric development industry is held back. With no one knowing what has happened it is just as likely that this fiasco is pushing for the people to push back on oil?
3685 2018-10-16 17:56:51 Of course we can! Same CO2 extraction process as our current CBD oil extracts. 
It's $75 a bottle/52.50 for compassionate. 1 cartridge = 5g deduction on your rx.  550mg of CBD and less than 30mg of THC per cartridge.
3686 2018-10-16 17:56:47 Hes most likely gonna do it himself if he has the oil . But idk chris okay if its a problem u come do it 
3687 2018-10-16 17:56:43 I still can't understand how delicious olive oil can come from disgusting olives.
3688 2018-10-16 17:56:41 There's no better embodiment of how much shit you can get away with if you're sitting on oil and you buy lots of weapons from the West than Saudia Arabia.
3689 2018-10-16 17:56:36 If you send lal qila you get more oil
3690 2018-10-16 17:56:31 Well considering Texas is booming and Beto wants to raise taxes, raise regulations on oil and gas drilling and thinks illegal border crossings should be decriminalized I can see why they stick with Cruz.
3691 2018-10-16 17:56:23 Aku kurang tau ka bisa buat bayi atau engga. Ini extra virgin olive oil biasanya aku pake buat di muka hehe. 250 ml 75ribu kak
3692 2018-10-16 17:56:19 Talks between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait over two shared oil fields have broken down after months of promise, shutting in some 500,000 b/d of anticipated oil production for the foreseeable future, sources close to the projects told S&P Global Platts.

I highly recommend you kindly back up off my ass sir...
3695 2018-10-16 17:56:09 Hello, Sir.  I too enjoy eating onion sandwiches with some light olive oil.  I'm sorry my nation, the USA, is a warmongering fascist empire ruled by a minority of rich parasites.  I wish your nation the best. Pray for us, please.
3696 2018-10-16 17:56:09 If Iran closes the Strait of Hormuz, it will prevent the flow of oil from most of the Gulf states and America will not be able to do anything ... the same situation of North Korea ...
3697 2018-10-16 17:56:08 Stress relief oil just applied, hope it works!
3698 2018-10-16 17:55:56 Thank God I have a new supply of CBD oil. 
3699 2018-10-16 17:55:51 Canada should PRAY for Saudi *oil weapon* to get better price for its crude oil.
3700 2018-10-16 17:55:48 You give her way to much credit. She would be kissing Saudi  button just like they are doing now. She would have to. They are keeping Iran down and supplying us with cheap oil.
3701 2018-10-16 17:55:43 @KopariBeauty Love, love coconut face oil!!
3702 2018-10-16 17:55:42 you could do one of your detailed videos on #prd and #euz
I would love that.
Your one today was really good.
3703 2018-10-16 17:55:38 You've heard me talk about this amazing oil for your hair, but here are several ways it can be used that are NOT for that purpose. It's amazing! Safe, non toxic, plant based oil that can help with so many skin conditions! 
We call it liquid gold for a reason!
3704 2018-10-16 17:55:36 Sorry lol I had too, Saudi Arabia yeah that thing, what did they do wrong to get the hate of countries that depend on its oil?
3705 2018-10-16 17:55:32 Why are you such a pushover for Putin and “the King”? Why team up with the bad guys? Tell us please! Are you a bad guy? Want the oil and afraid it will stop coming ?
3706 2018-10-16 17:55:03 Canola is a made-up name. It's rapeseed oil. I'm olive oil all the way, sometimes a touch of sunflower.  Checking labels/ingredients now for canola content, thanks.

3708 2018-10-16 17:54:42 This mother fucker smoked my oil and doesn’t give me anything in return. He buys a little bit of weed and smokes may be a joint or two with me a day And thinks that’s equal.
3709 2018-10-16 17:54:37 Fish oil in Japan and tomatoes and garlic in Italy. UK has Greggs - go figure - we have a great #nhs too.
3710 2018-10-16 17:54:29 Sorry, I'm a giant nerd for full spec supercritical extracts & I know you guys have the capability, bc you do your extracts for your oral cbd oil that way. So I'm... freaking out in a pretty big way over here. #nerdsneedtoknow #vaaaaape
3711 2018-10-16 17:54:25 Why not tap that water for farming? I read that a guy is making KES 4mn+ on 13 acres growing garlic and onions in semi-arid Ukambani. Start small. Why wait for some oil driller to provide water?

3715 2018-10-16 17:54:06 .@SenLisaBoscola Big-money oil and gas lobbyists are again threatening the health of PA families with their toxic agenda. Don’t let #HB2154 roll back critical drilling protections - vote NO on this toxic bill.
3716 2018-10-16 17:54:01 .@SenRichAlloway Rolling back protections from oil & gas pollution with this lobbyist-fueled bill in the final days of the legislative session is an affront to PA families and a giveaway to industry special interests. Vote NO on #HB2154.

3718 2018-10-16 17:53:57 Latest stunt, conniving by Trump, so called Saudi tensions, sanctions. Trio effort to spike oil prices for Saudi, Putin by Trump, a vassal of Putin & Saudi, help to  hide corrupt business hidden dealings.
3719 2018-10-16 17:53:55 .@senatorfolmer At the 11th hour, @PASenateGOP leadership is pushing a bill rolling back safeguards from oil&gas pollution that protect PA families. Oil&gas industry is again promoting their toxic agenda for political gain. Vote NO on #HB2154.
3720 2018-10-16 17:53:49 Nearly an exact century later, tech is the new oil. The shift from coal to oil solidified WW1's shift of the capitalist centre from Europe to the US, and along with it, established a new power balance. The US and Saudie Arabia are trying re-solidify this move.
3721 2018-10-16 17:53:42 And by doing so we will be providing them with more than just the meat. This has no difference than exporting oil in it's crude form we will be simply exporting jobs. We need to evaluate and look at some of these issues with a keen approach
3722 2018-10-16 17:53:42 My oil change light just came on  I need a boyfriend.
3723 2018-10-16 17:53:37 Long before Trump, the U.S. has been willing to overlook any wrongdoings of Saudi Arabia.  Money and Oil are that important to us.  We are willing to put our morals on hold by looking the other way.
3724 2018-10-16 17:53:33 Alec’s snap story is me drinking olive oil and then washing my mouth out with dish soap and Bret’s neighbor responded and said “I feel like she did that last time she was here” so someone knows me as the girl who drinks olive oil and that’s really hilarious
3725 2018-10-16 17:53:24 I never said the oil sands was a good thing, but let's be real the saudis, venezuelans, iranians all have oil bursting out of the ground that requires zero water to extract and in many cases a spill won't harm anything being in a desert
3726 2018-10-16 17:53:19 My local Whole Foods hippies like “castor oil is good for your skin because it’s all-natural and plant-derived” are in for a shock when they learn literally anything about that plant.

3728 2018-10-16 17:53:03 Would you like one or two bottles of olive oil with that?
3729 2018-10-16 17:52:52 My dry socket finally stopped hurting with this clove oil. Thank God for Twitter.
3730 2018-10-16 17:52:47 I just love it when you look at the bottle of olive oil and it says "contains olive oil" (uh huh) "from 27 countries filled with terrorists and scam artists".
3731 2018-10-16 17:52:45 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed #TexasDebate

3734 2018-10-16 17:52:23 Y’ALL. THIS CLOVE OIL 
3735 2018-10-16 17:52:20 And for what? A few drops more oil and to make a very few people richer. Seems like they could better leave well enough alone and invest in renewables. Maybe a solar farm or two.
3736 2018-10-16 17:52:09 .@Joe4COAG thinks oil & gas and their thousands of workers are immoral and said they "have no business here in the state of Colorado. Our state will be fine without them.” 

We disagree. What do @jaredpolis and @GovofCO think? 

#copolitics #cogov
3737 2018-10-16 17:52:03 Saudi Arabia’s use of oil as a weapon might play out like the Hunt brothers attempt to corner the silver market. It may end up hurting the KSA more than expected.
3738 2018-10-16 17:51:51 Fact , SA holds the oil barrel price for most of the world .

Fact , SA has finnanced many Trump /   Kushner deals .

Fact, Trump worn slash a $110 bill arms sale..that is a lot profit to give away for T.
3739 2018-10-16 17:51:41 Suncor is the only oil sands player with access to market as they are integrated within their supply chain all the way to the petro Canada gas pump. No other oil sands players are fully integrated.
3740 2018-10-16 17:51:41 @Europarl_EN Dear parlament members, what is doing Mr Sanchez' s goverment in relation to nonsanctions for Maduro's dictatorship  is inmoral and beyond the decency line. I hope that oil and wapen's deal can not buy your conscience as it looks like happened in Spain. SOS Venezuela
3741 2018-10-16 17:51:36 @realDonaldTrump @OEA_oficial Stop supporting dictatorships. The Hypocrisy of Democracy  
If Honduras had oil , it’d be different story. 
 “Otro gallo  cantaría”
3742 2018-10-16 17:51:35 NTB just told me it’s gonna be $60 for an oil change. HA.
3743 2018-10-16 17:51:29 im going to try to convince my mom to take a fat ass hit from my oil pen.!!!
"raul esto no funciona!"
"ma you gotta pull more of it!"
3744 2018-10-16 17:51:25 Hey, Roger! Thanks so much for reaching out with your question. The Aurora Cloud glass cartridge can be used with universal 510 battery packs for vaping. Alternatively, the oil can be removed for oral ingestion of the high CBD oil product. Have a fantastic day!
3745 2018-10-16 17:51:24 First, I don't think you've ever had McDonald's sober. Second, it could possibly be a bad batch of oil
3746 2018-10-16 17:51:23 Yes, a productive economy that not corn and oil and imaginary crypto. it's time to do away with this disposable society attitude, because it's gone too far people are not expendable.
3747 2018-10-16 17:51:22 I’m actually proud of myself. I’m at the garage getting an oil change by myself. Yes, might not seem like a big deal to the normal person, but for me it’s a big deal. Small victories matter 
3748 2018-10-16 17:51:18 I try in english  put in a dish 3/4 eggs red part and a little white, parmigiano (or similar cheese) grated, salt and a little pepper and shake all a long with a fork. Cook with small oil little pieces of bacon, just burned. When spaghetti (or pasta as you want) put inside all
3749 2018-10-16 17:51:16 it sucks  :'(  but yea it's really helping me today, that and if you wear gloves at night and mix shea butter with a bit of tea tree oil.
3750 2018-10-16 17:51:07 Yorkshire food business friends...a good friend of mine is looking to make #biodiesel for the first time - would anyone like to donate their used vegetable oil in the name of being green? #york
3751 2018-10-16 17:51:07 I have never known a host community to be happy about anything  until they get paid off.
What I do not understand is why do they WAIT until others show up?
The wind has been there before the Europeans built their first wind mill. Also the oil. And the water.
3752 2018-10-16 17:50:59 hope so...down on my #prd ...but holding.
3753 2018-10-16 17:50:56 I was baking myself in tanning oil whilst he was smothering himself in factor 50 hahaha
3754 2018-10-16 17:50:45 @DanaPerino  the Kashoggi family, as far back as Adnan Kashoggi, have always moved in grey areas. Arms sales and oil sales (AK Trading). Always balancing personal profits with advice to Royals. No surprise a low level prince might be upset and had him beaten with wrong results.
3755 2018-10-16 17:50:43 Medical cannabis isnot legal in Indiana yet. 

CBD oil is legal without prescription
3756 2018-10-16 17:50:40 Saudi Arabia is not our friend. Enough of the games, it’s time for us to expose their hate to the world.

No amount of oil should buy our silence.
3757 2018-10-16 17:50:39 Stop making sense.Canadian oil is selling at a discount while US oil is selling at WTI price.
Jamie is correct only morons invest in Canadian oil.
3758 2018-10-16 17:50:37 tip of the day: going to sleep while on benadryl with eucalyptus oil in the air will make you have acid dreams.
woke up and thought I was in the belly of a cow on the planet mercury.
3759 2018-10-16 17:50:32 I ain't afeard of no mustard oil dribble.

3763 2018-10-16 17:50:21 That supermarket has got a lot of shenanigans...to buy that cooking oil you first have to spend $10 on other things.
3764 2018-10-16 17:50:16 Walmart’s do oil changes as long as you have the auto care center
3765 2018-10-16 17:50:13 My big secret is that I keep a small bottle of vegetable oil hidden in my shelves because sometimes it’s better to cook with than olive oil. My secret shame.
3766 2018-10-16 17:50:02 I shure will u take care as well hope to stop in and see u soon do some mediation kinda slipin a bitt on consentraeing hope u maid some snake oil.
3767 2018-10-16 17:49:56 News: @BLMAlaska has approved the Greater Mooses Tooth 2 project, what would be @COP_Alaska's second oil development in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska proper, a week after first oil started flowing from Greater Mooses Tooth 1
3768 2018-10-16 17:49:49 @patrick_oshag Patrick, my man. The Dubai exchange is trading at a 7x forward PE. Can we get your take on the GCC market and why the region with half of the world's oil and gas reserves is being treated like a distressed Eastern European market?
3769 2018-10-16 17:49:47 Yes! IF it's a water based serum. Oil based serums go at the end of your routine :)
3770 2018-10-16 17:49:45 The Muslim brotherhood exists to rid the world of western influences The prince is welcoming west ideas to focus on more than oil
3771 2018-10-16 17:49:33 So why shouldn’t all of America be friends with S Arabia? They have been ours. We have used their oil for how long?
3772 2018-10-16 17:49:31 だってちんげって必要なくない？
3773 2018-10-16 17:49:28 They aren't going to do anything to Saudi. They've already got more sanctions on Iran to make the price of oil go up. And Iran is selling oil to China. That plane deal is just a figment of Trumpy's imagination. Nice try Lindsey...
3774 2018-10-16 17:49:27 Hey Samantha - Is it hemp based CBD oil or cannabis based oil?  Curious what people are taking and if it works for them... TY - And I'm really glad it has helped with your anxiety & stress!
3775 2018-10-16 17:49:18 Are you serious, Saudi’s $500 billions are there in US. All Saudi’s oil is controlled by US. KSA can do nothing.
3776 2018-10-16 17:49:14 Fact:You people have nothing besides oil. The day it finishes you'll again start selling dates in ur desert.
Remember the sky scrapers and great infrastructure projects that u see in ur country are all made with the thirst and sweat of indian labour whom u treat in inhuman way.

3778 2018-10-16 17:49:13 This deficit is actually Westminster's supposedoverspend on behalf of Scotland. and it does not take into account the North Sea oil The GERS figures show theperformance of Scotland's finances within the UK.They’re no bearing on Scotland's economic situation when we’re independent
3779 2018-10-16 17:48:55 yo this niggga been talking for like a good 15 mins no customers niggggga just change my oil pleaseeeee fucking Dominicans conoooo.
3780 2018-10-16 17:48:55 Can’t criticise too much otherwise the cost of a barrel of oil will triple.
3781 2018-10-16 17:48:54 But since Pres Trump had a brain he bolted out of the asinine Paris yuck yuck accord 

Allowing 2 biggest polluters to pollute for next 20 yrs while we had to double our pollution controls costing billions

3785 2018-10-16 17:48:12 Mearsheimer: Three areas matter strategically to the United States - Europe, East Asia, and the Persian Gulf (NOT the Middle East, but the Persian Gulf because of oil.)
3786 2018-10-16 17:48:09 i almost busted my ass cause i walked into my parents bathroom and my mom sprayed oil on the floor and didn’t tell me
3787 2018-10-16 17:48:06 @LancsForShale - I’ve just seen your spokesman on North West Tonight describe Aberdeen,pre-North Sea oil, as a “fishing village”. Ridiculously idiotic statement. If that’s the best you can do there’s no way you will ever win over public support.

3790 2018-10-16 17:48:02 No sugars added, or oil?
3791 2018-10-16 17:48:01 3 letter word says they won't -OIL!
3792 2018-10-16 17:47:58 I heard a rumor that people from the east coast buy all their sex toys used from garage sales. 
3793 2018-10-16 17:47:46 @mitchellvii Bill can you help shed light on #112 otherwise bye bye oil and gas jobs
3794 2018-10-16 17:47:45 LOL.....First, Saudi Arabia is NOT your main supply of oil, 40% is produced in your own Country and Canada is the biggest supplier followed by SA. You can bet, if the US and others don't get answers......Saudi Arabia will have no buyers.
3795 2018-10-16 17:47:42 @NathanFillion  loved to hear about the flashlights on @TheSocialCTV today! I found 46 cleaning my fathers house after he passed. He said it was cheaper to buy a new one, than it was to get a new battery. Also found my grandfathers oil light from the mine in 1920

3800 2018-10-16 17:47:18 This whole essential oil thing is actually getting quite addicting. I’m ¡thisclose to drenching myself in it.

Yesterday chaiyo WE looked for Cooking Oil GWERU & KWEKWE it was no where to be found,Vakutora ma Pictures eku Westgate manje FOOLING WHO?- BUT musadaro Vakomana muri vanhu vekuziva
3802 2018-10-16 17:47:13 PMLN govt failed to curtail line losses & improve efficiency (capacity vs production vs distribution). PTI Gov should immediately start on that aspect while passing on only essential price hike due to dollar & oil price to consumer - I could be wrong but that’s what I understand
3803 2018-10-16 17:47:10 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.
3804 2018-10-16 17:47:03 Oh what a surprise! When Canada stood up to this evil regime the world hid under rocks. Now everyone is surprised that such a lovely culture can do this. Oh yes the world is worried about oil going up.
3805 2018-10-16 17:46:56 Mangeda   oil
3806 2018-10-16 17:46:53 Soooo Vladimir Putin is apparently the 6th richest man in the world. Why? Quote "oil, gas, investments"
Who's the biggest oil trader?  
Yall see the dilemma right?
3807 2018-10-16 17:46:38 For someone who has very little knowledge on crude oil assays, any suggestions on literature / resources to start with?
3808 2018-10-16 17:46:31 now thats a longer story... We locked in the carry to July and sold 5 BNSF shuttle trains (440,000bu) to Hereford Texas to pick up the pile that summer. Was built for about $1/bu in 2007.  Oil was so crazy then, the asphalt price changed by the week.
3809 2018-10-16 17:46:21 But oil price became high again...
3810 2018-10-16 17:46:19 Don't you realize we need to be looking at cleaner alternatives than oil? We know how to harness geothermal energy to heat our homes, we're continuously improving our technology on wind power, upgrading the amount of charge on solar panels, and we're already improving hybrids.
3811 2018-10-16 17:46:16 *ohnoes* poor bibi! just get a pot, pour oil & voila!

3815 2018-10-16 17:45:47 Feel pretty good this evening, a productive appointment with the GP. She always cheers me up. 

Made nice rice, mix long and wild (4:1) dribble in olive oil in as you are steaming it. Eaten with sautéed sliced bell peppers. Seasoned with tarragon and oregano, cayenne pepper. 
3816 2018-10-16 17:45:46 @realDonaldTrump why are you not coming to Colorado to help us on Prop #112 Vote NO on #112 or gas and oil jobs are gone!!!
3817 2018-10-16 17:45:43 I use their ufo oil soo if anyone has any recommendations for a good replacement for combo skin that'd be great
3818 2018-10-16 17:45:37 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed #TexasDebate

3821 2018-10-16 17:45:24 @LindseyGrahamSC @marcorubio 

Torture, murder are good reasons to invade #SaudiArabia. 

Imagine how much oil America can own?

#SaudiRegimeChange
3822 2018-10-16 17:45:21 tenía entendido que para el marzo 2001 se producían 3.862.000 b/d sin meter convenio operativo (ameriven, teikoku oil, etc), hoy es 1 millón sumando lo que generan las Petro y demás convenios
3823 2018-10-16 17:45:18 N Power is 30k minimum.  which ordinary Nigerians did PDP help in 16 years of misrule.  Thousands of Nigerians are been empowered with this little token and it is nothing to u.  When oil sold for above 150 they stole everything and u r condemning those helping the poor.
3824 2018-10-16 17:45:18 By Canadas own numbers we contribute 1.6% (we are 0.4% human pop) and that number does not account for the oil we supply being burnt in other countries. We are one of the largest oil producers in the world and we need a clear, urgent strategy to leave that oil in the ground.
3825 2018-10-16 17:45:14 I need an oil change
3826 2018-10-16 17:45:05 Canada's oil industry is being busted out deliberately.  Canada's weak, virtue signalling leaders being taken to the woodshed.  The Liberal Party government must be voted out of office as soon as possible to save Canada.
3827 2018-10-16 17:45:00 3/3 Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest oil exporter, said on Sunday it would retaliate against any punitive measures linked to the disappearance of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi with even “stronger ones." In an implicit reference to the kingdom’s petroleum wealth
3828 2018-10-16 17:44:53 By the way, it's students you're meeting o. 

But if you can gather like N100,000, you'll get a good oil painter portraitist. Or is it Hyperrralism Pencil work you want?
3829 2018-10-16 17:44:46 throwback to when my mum put sun cream on our roast chicken instead of cooking oil spray and nearly poisoned all of us

3831 2018-10-16 17:44:37 I don't know Cliff when 100 experts tell me to do something and 1 guy tells me something else I usually go with the 100.

Maybe siding with oil companies on this one instead of scientists and the state's health professionals wasn't the best idea.
3832 2018-10-16 17:44:32 Trump is most likely the one who came up with the fabrication about Khashoggis demise.  Had to save his b.s. deal.  And the oil.   Making it okay to murder our (almost) citizens. What a greedy coward!
3833 2018-10-16 17:44:31 Poverty, rising oil prices, improvement of roading etc etc etc 
3834 2018-10-16 17:44:30 $CEI oil index are green... Probably jumping later on today ?
3835 2018-10-16 17:44:29 I had a train of tiny little unidentifiable bugs traveling the length of my place from bathroom window to balcony for three weeks.  Tried raid.  Peppermint Oil.  Threats of defamation of character.  They persisted.  Then—all at once—their pilgrimage ceased.
3836 2018-10-16 17:44:29 You can see the numbers are fairly similar in 2013 and 2014 before NDP took over. 
Also Mental health services given declined from 82% -67% for children from 0-17. 

Which means the increase is for adults. 

You don't think that has anything to do with a collapse in oil jobs?
3837 2018-10-16 17:44:29 Price has to go up due to $ appreciation & oil prices. But it seems govt wants to recover line losses also, which is about ⅔ of 36 billion deficit info minister quoted. The way to curtail that portion is through increased efficiency & management, not price hike.
3838 2018-10-16 17:44:24 And Trump does not like Iranian oil for just this reason...

3840 2018-10-16 17:44:21 .@JiffyLubeSoCal  Taking over an hour for an oil change at #3264...  Clients are not happy with service.
3841 2018-10-16 17:44:17 Ha, bloomberg this morning reported the deal as requiring musk to step down as CEO.  These networks are heavily influenced by oil money via advertisers and non-ev car companies.  They are often the ones fueling the attack on musk.
3842 2018-10-16 17:44:14 The players that stood with Notley after the climate deal was signed had one intention, and one intention only; use the carbon tax to consolidate industry and eliminate entrepreneurial, and small to mid size investment in the oil sands. It back fired, big time!
3843 2018-10-16 17:44:08 Let’s see what the UK government and the us government do about this, probably nothing. Massive sanctions on Russia, this country should have had sanctions put on them years ago. Oh but wait oil and Arms sales Trumps human violations.
3844 2018-10-16 17:44:01 Am I the only person that sits in the car while their oil is getting changed??
3845 2018-10-16 17:43:57 Shit. Sorry. Meant oil 
3846 2018-10-16 17:43:56 If your talking more about the future of America's oil supply & arms deals -- you're focusing on the wrong thing.
3847 2018-10-16 17:43:42 Venezuela's already been done hasn't it? The CIA have been destabilising it for years. Can't have socialists running a country with all that oil to pillage can we?
3848 2018-10-16 17:43:42 @DonaldJTrumpJr can you help us on Prop #112 in Colorado. ..Vote NO otherwise bye bye oil and gas jobs
3849 2018-10-16 17:43:40 USA stopped Giving भीख to Pakistan

3850 2018-10-16 17:43:39 I think our countries total dependence on foreign oil would say different.
3851 2018-10-16 17:43:28 So now the US can buy oil from Venezuela to lower the skyrocketing price at the pump

3854 2018-10-16 17:43:03 Maybe it’s a deal about oil taxes or something knowing how much the federal government taxes oil. They may not owe anything
3855 2018-10-16 17:42:55 So my coworker made a cake with rancid oil so I’m probably about to die.
3856 2018-10-16 17:42:52 Disgusting and brutal. What price America for protecting journalists? Military equipment? Oil?

I love you, assholes 

May you be clubbed by a baby harp seal for your sins against nature
3858 2018-10-16 17:42:42 Me too. I try out different recipes all the time but for something easy I just use Robertson fish spice, salt, pepper, olive oil, onions, tomatoes and some lemon at the end.
3859 2018-10-16 17:42:34 The Swiss press is spinning the same stories.  What do you expect from the Saudi Summer Home.
By building batteries, we can go electric, stopping Saudi Oil AND helping the Climate.  Since we have 0 years.
Just saying.
3860 2018-10-16 17:42:30 Thanks for all that love!  GOOD NEWS: the oil can be removed for oral ingestion of the high CBD oil product, allowing patients the ability to choose how they consume their medication. Otherwise, the cart can be used with universal 510 battery packs for vaping.
3861 2018-10-16 17:42:23 There are so many things wrong with this country , concerning muslim rights. Goverment are bending over bk wards to appease them, while trying to silence anyone who critisies them.  SA oil money.
3862 2018-10-16 17:42:11 I had a dream last night that I visited you. You asked if i could make my tamarind marinade for some fish, veggies, and noodles. But i didn't have the ingredients and we improvised with fruity vinegar, oil, and soy sauce.
3863 2018-10-16 17:42:09 Tired: Netflix and chill
Wired: Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat, repeat, move to Italy, press my own olive oil, collect salt from the ocean, become besties with Samin Nosrat (all evidence shows she is currently the most delightful human on the planet), plant a lemon tree
3864 2018-10-16 17:42:08 I have to leave for class in 20 minutes but they’re not done doing the oil change for my car yet so I’m stressingggggg
3865 2018-10-16 17:41:57 2/3 For 45 years, it’s been considered out of bounds for Saudi Arabia. But all of a sudden, Riyadh made what many read as a veiled threat to use the kingdom’s oil wealth as a political weapon -- something unheard of since the 1973 Arab embargo that triggered the first oil crisis.
3866 2018-10-16 17:41:52 I think when he's at home with his kids Ferguson is probably normal.

Peterson I suspect is 24/7/365 snake oil salesman pseudo-intellectual narcissist and his daughter, well, her apple didn't fall far from the tree.
3867 2018-10-16 17:41:37 This was obviously staged.
Oil marks on her face and none on her pure white scarf.

3869 2018-10-16 17:41:18 The cooking gods are against me today. Made mango salsa then dropped full bottle of balsamic vinegar. Glass and vinegar everywhere. Salsa in the trash. Just sauteing some vegetables for later and hot oil splattered into my tear duct. Hurts like hell.
3870 2018-10-16 17:41:10 @bpnutrition coffee, brain octane oil, and butter.  it!
3871 2018-10-16 17:41:06 And the #trudeau plan is to increase taxes, kill good paying jobs, import oil from questionable sources, and implement a carbon tax that is a revenue policy - not an environmental policy. I’ll take my changes. Fed #Liberal gov is failing (here & in many other areas).
3872 2018-10-16 17:41:00 oh - I hear the feeble accident excuse being banded about by the USA

For 45 years, it’s been considered out of bounds for Saudi Arabia. But all of a sudden, Riyadh made what many read as a veiled threat to use the kingdom’s oil wealth as a political weapon
3875 2018-10-16 17:40:20 if i had my way, I would bankrupt all the major oil companies today :-)
3876 2018-10-16 17:40:19 So are an oil baron or something? Are you anti-living wage? Should we just accept whatever pittance is thrown at workers because you want Parton to avoid scrutiny?
3877 2018-10-16 17:40:14 In the past it would have been difficult to break the relationship due to oil.  But now we have plenty of our own oil, plenty of allies that will sell us oil, and the transition to electric cars is in full swing. Time to change the US-Saudi relationship. 

My avatar makes sense.

3879 2018-10-16 17:40:11 That Keystone XL pipeline would've come in handy about now with all that cheap secure supply of oil for Americans! Too bad the Republicans decided they hate us in Canada.

3883 2018-10-16 17:40:02 Can you please also focus on electric cars?  The media had been trashing Tesla and being completely unfair to them.. it’s obvious big oil/auto is controlling many media companies.  I’m sure you can relate to unfair media coverage!  please help @tesla and @elonmusk!  Thank you!
3884 2018-10-16 17:40:02 Oh they gave you the palm oil from the hospital abi 
3885 2018-10-16 17:39:59 Current rate of crude oil is around about 72 so what should be do buy or sell
3886 2018-10-16 17:39:59 Ok, so there's a legitimate argument. "Stop buying oil from countries that repress its people's individual freedoms". Now ask yourself, who does that hurt most? The uber-rich in every oil country but Canada, or the low to middle class in America who rely on affordable energy?
3887 2018-10-16 17:39:48 Saudi money and oil is more important, then one dead journalist!! Beyond Dispcable!!

#StarvingIndia will send rice to procure crude oil.
3891 2018-10-16 17:39:39 It’ll grow back I know it sucks  buy this oil I’ll DM it to you Cuz I don’t remember the name of it. It helped me a lot. If not I think it would’ve taken longer to grow back. I used to use my brow pomade to cover the patches
3892 2018-10-16 17:39:31 Sorry. One guy getting killed going to a place he probably should have known better than to go is not worth $200 barrels of oil.
3893 2018-10-16 17:39:22 Let them, and we'll pull the 5th Fleet out and they can insure their own oil and make sure it goes through Hormuz. Maybe we should cut a deal with the Shia, Persian leaders hate us people love us
3894 2018-10-16 17:39:16 Thought I’d be smart & come in the middle of a Tuesday to get my oil changed since I thought there wouldn’t be a lot of people. Well.. there’s 6 people in front of me 
3895 2018-10-16 17:39:08 If you think rUK would not trade with an independent Scotland then you're not very bright. rUK need our oil, water and excess electricity

3900 2018-10-16 17:38:31 . Steph, if palm oil and grounded pepper was living lavish, I'd love to hear your own story.
3901 2018-10-16 17:38:28 Thank god that Trump pulled regs on drilling and fracking.   Otherwise, saudi would have us totally over a barrel right now.   Even with 8% (instead of 25%) of our oil coming from ME, we are restrained in reactions.    Good incentive to drill more
3902 2018-10-16 17:38:27 I just want hot water so I can take a shower. When is the oil truck getting here? Mom, I’m cold
3903 2018-10-16 17:38:25 Was afraid I left the baby oil on show in the background just after I posted it
3904 2018-10-16 17:38:21 Could you please explain it to us? We don't understand why your screwing farmers and the oil industry. #cdnpoli
3905 2018-10-16 17:38:04 Yes and they produce copious amounts of oil. So until we get our economies decoupled from that commodity, we'll be forced to dance with many devil's.
3906 2018-10-16 17:38:03 It's always about the money, not the fact that a journalist was brutally murdered for simply doing his job but to save precious oil (which btw, we don't even friggin need) and of course money.
3907 2018-10-16 17:38:02 Ergo we don't give a CRAP about their oil. Way to defeat your own argument!!

Quoting wild numbers , because he know the listeners aren’t terribly conversant in the changes that are required. Don’t worry, and above all don’t stop burning oil

3920 2018-10-16 17:36:56 17 years ago a Saudi hit squad killed almost 3,000 of our citizens on 9/11. Bush gave Saudis a pass due to oil. @realDonaldTrump won’t hold Saudis accountable for killing & chopping up US resident #Kashoggi. The Saudiin Trump and Jared’s pockets seem to outweigh  values.

3923 2018-10-16 17:36:33 I still don't get why would they do that. For oil?
3924 2018-10-16 17:36:29 They're 3x3x1 so pretty good size, no Palm oil, vegan and the lather is great too. We've Bern using them for a year now for residual energy removal, grounding, sooth etc.

3926 2018-10-16 17:36:09 How long are we going to put up with murderous Saudis just because they are oil rich? If you want to NEVER FORGET something, NEVER FORGET that the 9/11 terrorists were Saudis; but the US invaded Afghanistan and Iraq in retaliation, while Bush held photo opps with Saudi princes...
3927 2018-10-16 17:36:09 Just an excuse to go to war. Why is every country getting involved for? Oh they want oil i see. Absolute joke. I bet the countries that are outraged are probably the ones who kidnapped him. Joke BS
3928 2018-10-16 17:36:04 Yeah, but they would love to have our oil reserves.  Only idiots like the Trudeau Liberals would keep it in the ground.

3932 2018-10-16 17:35:40 Psalm 23:5

‘You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.’

- The Lord has wonderful and good things planned for you.
- You may have had enemies, but He will bring you to a place of peace.
3933 2018-10-16 17:35:36 Brain Octane is a great MCT Oil product too. I love the way it enhances flavor in dishes. But as far as putting it in coffee, don’t really see the point. I’m a firm believer in intermittent fasting. And fats in your coffee breaks the fast. To each his/her own, I guess.
3934 2018-10-16 17:35:32 So we just can't say no to other countries, but we'll say no to our own people? See how dumb THAT sounds?
What military aid are we sending to Europe? Our big expenditures are in the Middle East where we CONSTANTLY meddle because we want the oil.
3935 2018-10-16 17:35:30 Thanks! Our weekend was swell hope your own was hoopy!

3936 2018-10-16 17:35:26 One word, oil.
3937 2018-10-16 17:35:14 Higher oil prices would likely increase Canadian oil production and  a quicker completion of the Keystone XL pipeline.
3938 2018-10-16 17:35:06 @OpTic_DKarma Hey man. I heard you talk about your hands hurting from playing claw and gaming in general. Have you ever tried using CBD oil? I think it would definitely reduce soreness and help your recovery if you were open to trying it!
3939 2018-10-16 17:34:56 I just went live at Dr. Nicole M. Eastman, D.O. (on Facebook).  I spoke more about EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing) and shared an update regarding 3 months use of prescribed @CanniMed Ltd. medical cannabis oil. (1/3)

Further, Yamen has to pay for this..remember that $110 billion deal of weapons between USA & Saudi!
USA has simple policy...Saudi should continue fighting war in Yamen, keep on purchasing weapons & keep oil prices low...And in return Saudi can do what the hell they wish to!

3952 2018-10-16 17:33:48 Nothing, he's just a coward and that only thing that he knows is to apply more taxes, increase the oil prices, kill people who protest against of him, and etc etc etc.

Things I buy: iced coffee and chicken nuggets 
3955 2018-10-16 17:33:38 Sounds about right @realDonaldTrump has not spoke a word of truth since the day his daddy started using him to filter $ illegally. Nothing about the Orange Mushroom tip is truthful the sad thing is there are so many ignorant people who buy into the snake oil salesman that he is
3956 2018-10-16 17:33:34 Prayers are a given, but along with them please try some CBD oil. I heard it works as good if not better than chemo. It is what I heard, also some even mention THC. It won’t hurt to try I believe. Blessings
3957 2018-10-16 17:33:32 Which is down to world markets ... not endogenous. The UK cannot influence the price of oil down to $40. Had the price of oil been stable, current wage growth would actually be higher.
3958 2018-10-16 17:33:30 Fr tho! Cooking and baking are significantly easier than the media make them out to be! Buy a chicken breast, cut it up, and throw it in a pan with veg oil, soy sauce, and brown sugar until it's not pink in the center. Boil rice and broccoli. Fckn ezpz.

3967 2018-10-16 17:32:38 @LBC @Nigel_Farage the West is frightened of Saudi Arabia because it is an economic super power which can disrupt the oil price catastrophically. They also have billions of dollars of US and UK bonds.
3968 2018-10-16 17:32:33 It is a sad state of affair that we have to keep these "allies" even though they operate on values completely opposite to our own because of oil and money.

3982 2018-10-16 17:31:41 That’s why opening up the U.S. oil supply market has been so important. We don’t have to feel beholden to anyone...we’re self sufficient. And we can even produce an excess and supply some of what Saudi Arabia won’t if they cut back on production. 

So the threats are useless.
3983 2018-10-16 17:31:39 Oil rising due to global factor and high excise required as previous govt led by ECONOMIST kept oil price low by issuing oil bond, effectively passing on the debt to next govt. Unemployment I agree, job addition is below par, however entrepreneurship on a high
3984 2018-10-16 17:31:33 am pretty sure that he must have gone to sniff a conq unrefined crude oil...#irranu
3985 2018-10-16 17:31:29 Just tried my first cup of "bulletproof" coffee. Homemade, I'm sure someone sells it put together. Coffee, monkfruit sweetener, coconut oil, butter, heavy cream, and vanilla extract. Not bad. Rich. Creamy.
3986 2018-10-16 17:31:23 If I could ask Trump to do one thing before leaving office, I think I would ask him to seize all the oil companies that drill on our land. Government is supposed to run our infrastructure. That oil should be given to us, not the highest bidder.
3987 2018-10-16 17:30:38 For example, what did Khashoggi know about Aramco & its oil reserves? SA has probably been exaggerating its reserves for several decades now & that IPO thing makes the topic profiteeringly relevant. Been wondering what he knew on the topic since I heard about his probable death.
3988 2018-10-16 17:30:36 If Saudi involvement of journalist murder proves true. @realDonaldTrump push for Oil independence proves itself.

3991 2018-10-16 17:30:23 2 other factors in the equation would also have to be addressed, the U.S. petrodollar status (a deal worked w/OPEC nations during Nixon admin.) & the MIC making $$ selling weapons to those nations.
I read historically, the U.S. buys more oil from Canada than it does from SA
3992 2018-10-16 17:30:16 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
3993 2018-10-16 17:30:12 It is not cong vs bjp.. it is understanding the underlying economic reason for the oil price deregulation after 60 years of govt's intervention to control price of petrol and play soft.. congress should be happy they had manmohan as PM who started this policy in india..
3994 2018-10-16 17:30:10 If you’re ever feeling ugly go get your oil changed

Democrats: UNDO YOUR TAX CUTS FOR CORPORATIONS AND RICH PEOPLE. THEN WE'LL TALK ABOUT SUBSIDIES FOR OIL COMPANIES.
Mitch: I meant cutting the safety net ....
3997 2018-10-16 17:30:00 They are guilty as charged. They are awash with oil and use the money to bribe western countries. I think GB is bought and paid for. Seems as though Trump is also on side.
3998 2018-10-16 17:29:59 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
3999 2018-10-16 17:29:46 Bit disappointed that lead merc went into thc oil instead of organic qat farming

4001 2018-10-16 17:29:39 A Christmas Story. It's a yearly reminder not to shoot my eye out!
4002 2018-10-16 17:29:29 Folks tried to use that same scare tactic here when pushing for an oil terminal. "If we don't build it, someone else will and they'll get all the benefits!" Thankfully, we killed the project, anyway, and it didn't spring up elsewhere.
4003 2018-10-16 17:29:18 Bredrin’, it nuh’ matter if him is ah’ piece of shit. Bush was, too (Stealing oil).  But further disgracing the Whitehouse, parading “mushroom” size, etc.  How does that look for the USA on the world stage? Other ways for Stormy to make money.
4004 2018-10-16 17:29:09 oil is the PHD of the economy...
4005 2018-10-16 17:29:00 Just got an oil change filled up my tank got some weed got some food I spent bout $200 that fuckin quick.
4006 2018-10-16 17:28:58 Canadians will be allowed to consume cannabis and cannabis oil and to grow up to four plants at home.
4007 2018-10-16 17:28:46 You are talking about oil?Ar nt you?
4008 2018-10-16 17:28:45 Of course they wont .

SA has the trumbs on the oil barrels , and do you remotely think @realDonaldTrump will slap the hands that feed is loans ? 
Dont forget how much does he benifets from a $110 bil arms sale?

C'mon, We know better .

4012 2018-10-16 17:28:17 U don't tweet like rational equity investor, more like political stooge

Economy doing best, inflation continuously below 5% (despite high oil) and positive real rates promoting investment in financial asset, unlike earlier corrupt government leading to double digit inflation
4013 2018-10-16 17:28:15 Agree about NO PHARMA ADS & letting the doctor, not patient, decide what drugs to prescribe. But Pharma likely won’t reduce prices; instead will pocket “savings” from ads because drug sales will plummet. But I feel ZERO compassion for the Snake Oil Industry or their Drug Pushers.
4014 2018-10-16 17:28:00 But it was bullshit. Snake oil salesmen know they’re peddling a useless product.
4015 2018-10-16 17:27:45 Finally getting my oil changed
4016 2018-10-16 17:27:36 Yes my son has seizures ... we’ve tried everything for 3 years - he was on cbd oil which was working until i got a diff non medical grade brand - he went into break through seizures and scared us so bad we went to the ER. But had we not gone we should of never known about a diff
4017 2018-10-16 17:27:20 As long as he brings a barrel of oil with him  Would love to see him in the skull and crossbones but can't see it ever happening

4020 2018-10-16 17:27:11 No, it's to do with the most oil rich country in the world spending all of their oil windfall and borrowing on top of that to pay for programmes they couldn't afford.
4021 2018-10-16 17:27:08 I work in the oil industry. At least once or twice a year (sometimes more) we work shut downs. They can last from a week to a few months at a time with 80 to 100+ hour weeks usually away from home. No one I've ever worked with is forced to do so. It's parr of the job

4033 2018-10-16 17:26:30 If you have endless amounts of money you are untouchable apparently. Shit even if it’s not endless, large amounts of money will suffice. And you get to make the laws that don’t apply to you, damn I gotta strike oil somewhere!!

4035 2018-10-16 17:26:30 We will see how long saying no to Saudi Gas, Money and Oil lasts. 
4036 2018-10-16 17:26:29 “If you go 12-0 and don’t teach your team anything, you’re a failure.” Nope, PJ. If you go 12-0 we’ll build you a damn statue and you’ll be a legend - nobody will give a damn whether you “taught” your team anything. So much snake oil. #GopherFootball
4037 2018-10-16 17:26:29 Dear Pradhansewakji do your best to contain Oil prices. Please rest assured people of India now no longer will be convinced by  rumour mongers for Oil for politics so called GDP .Gas Diesel Petrol  
You not politician alike Statesman think next generation not for next Election
4038 2018-10-16 17:26:15 Not to mention one possibly sitting on (since ARAMCO has never published figures) the largest untapped oil reserves in the world.
4039 2018-10-16 17:26:09 You’re not intermittent fasting if you’re drinking butter coffee. Your digestive organs are digesting and processing the fat. Your fast ends with bulletproof coffee. Plus, it’s not healthy. Minimal nutrition in butter and MCT oil. Your body is better off resting/repairing.

4041 2018-10-16 17:26:06 I think your previous tweet about the geoengineering is more likely driving the venue choice. As you pointed out, IAR holds patents to remedy toxic change events like the BP oil spill. It's not a coincidence.
4042 2018-10-16 17:26:00 I personally always thought that the Qatar-Turkey-Iran alliance was responsible for #Khashoggi disappearance or they hired someone inside the consulate to do it in order to isolate Saudi Arabia and sabotage the coming oil sanctions on Iran that Saudi promised replacing shortage
4043 2018-10-16 17:25:58 yes he generalized it to the lgtb. They is an igbo saying (when a finger is deep into oil, it gets to the whole community) so I understand where he is coming from but my point is the fact he is calling him lazy and forgetting he is a man. I don't understand why he should say dat
4044 2018-10-16 17:25:53 1.Annual economic growth 7.4%

5.GST 
6.High Petrol Prices - Govt paid 2lakh Cr oil bonds taken by UPA Govt
4045 2018-10-16 17:25:52 Yea definitely a great investment, you can buy the pens anywhere, they have cheap ones for like $10, I bought mine for $40 because you can adjust the hits, and there’s no button, so you can just pull on it, & then obviously you need to buy the oil from the plug. Great investment.
4046 2018-10-16 17:25:50 Just realized how quickly I dismiss when people recommend oil or oregano to fight a cold but how much I embrace the medicinal virtues of whisky and hot sauce.
4047 2018-10-16 17:25:16 The Russians and China can use Facebook and social media to influence our elections. The Saudis can decide which party dominates Congress and the White House with Oil prices.
4048 2018-10-16 17:25:15 Your concerned about oil and coal when we produce most electricity from natural gas and leading the country in Wind Energy. Oh, by all means pretend in your little head it is 1979 still! LOL

4050 2018-10-16 17:25:13 That oil is controlled by socialists.

4054 2018-10-16 17:24:46 Knowing your record in Michigan @BetsyDeVosED , as well as your crusade to do away with all protections for students, I'm much more inclined to believe the Senator than any of the snake oil you're peddling.

"We want answers!"
"Yeah, we murdered him, what are you going to do about it?"
"We'll... take your oil, but we're going to be giving you SUCH A DIRTY LOOK when we write the check. The memo will be "Shame on you.""

4061 2018-10-16 17:24:14 Like what? They could just double the price per barrel of oil and send gas to $6 a gallon. Glad you don't work for the State Department

4067 2018-10-16 17:23:46 It’s all about getting lower oil from them; or charging more for the military protection the U$ is providing SA...
4068 2018-10-16 17:23:41 American culture: take over the country, genocidal moves on the original occupants, kill their entire food source almost to extinction, break treaties. Cut 2000 yr old trees,mine precious metals/oil, fish out the oceans and rivers, toy with forigners... the u.s. was never great.
4069 2018-10-16 17:23:30 We tried the 5% CBD oil from Holland and Barretts and it was okay and helped me sleep but did not do much for Susan @creativefibro I guess she might need a higher dose, plus she does not like the taste, so capsules would be the way to go, also very pricey
4070 2018-10-16 17:23:23 $CEI what with the lack of media coverage of the company's Panhandle project progress with rising profit from oil wells recently restored.
4071 2018-10-16 17:22:58 Recalled. Is the reporting that Saudi Arabia has recalled its ambassadors? cuz that's a big deal. Also a big deal if the Sauds are trying to play coy about recalling their ambassadors. &, hey, it'd be nice if journalists could start connecting all of this to rising oil prices.
4072 2018-10-16 17:22:55 does your raw lapis lazuli seem to be getting dull?? put some essential oil on it :)
4073 2018-10-16 17:22:52 Slipped over on some omega 3 tablets. Don't worry,only got super fish oil injuries.
4074 2018-10-16 17:22:48 When eating a cucumber just add salt, olive oil, and squeeze a lime. That’s all it needs! Omg sooo good! 
I love things with lime 
4075 2018-10-16 17:22:46 It's very sad that a journalist was murdered in cold blood by d very people who should b protecting him in far away Turkey. D Kingdom of Saudi Arabia may b d largest exporter of oil but this is very disappointing. But what will d West do in d face of Saudi's billions of petro$ ?
4076 2018-10-16 17:22:41 Laughed at by world leaders? The feminist from Canada got put in his place quickly. Merkel said nothing when they were called out about depending on Russia for oil. Mexico realized they had to give in to our trade demands. Most publications mock him, because they are liberals lol
4077 2018-10-16 17:22:38 Ok so my mom got me an oil diffuser for my birthday... I’ve always laughed at oil diffusers but now I think I might have to use it to get all the good smells if nothing else.
4078 2018-10-16 17:22:35 For glowy autumn skin I recommend multiple moisturisers—nice rich ones at that. Choose either a separate night cream to day cream, or a few drops of a face oil in your day moisturiser before going to bed #skincare
4079 2018-10-16 17:22:33 Exhausted. Up and down. The funeral’s tomorrow, so once I get through that I’ll know better. I slept well last night. Olive oil in the ears helps, plus James slept and snored upstairs.

4094 2018-10-16 17:21:18 US has been abetting and supporting these jihadist dictators for over seven decades with the collusion of Americans. Why? Well for Israel; corrupt money; oil and lately Iran. Even 9/11 murders couldn’t stop America against these dictators. Imagine.
4095 2018-10-16 17:21:17 There’s been plenty of talk in the oil industry. It’s not acceptable to come to work drunk so same for pot. Have you ever tried it?
4096 2018-10-16 17:21:11 A coconut oil store called “The Commune,” sold for a variety of uses, because you really can use it for everything.

4104 2018-10-16 17:20:50 and all the khashoggi nonsense to try to make saudis into a new enemy, probably to strong arm them for refusing to lower oil prices and giving up on proxy terrorist financing
4105 2018-10-16 17:20:38 
4106 2018-10-16 17:20:37 I find it interesting, that, with the Iran deal gone, the Saudi's are in line to make hundreds of billions in various deals (including oil)... So of course trump is supporting them. 

If he doesn't, he looses out on hotel / development deals.
4107 2018-10-16 17:20:14 Oil Prices have fallen, with investors shrugging off media reports suggesting that Iranian crude exports have fallen further in the first two weeks of October

4111 2018-10-16 17:19:50 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed #TexasDebate
4112 2018-10-16 17:19:34 Oil painting is fucking hard.
4113 2018-10-16 17:19:25 We are! This makes difference between fossil fuel car maker with middle age mentality and electric car maker with strong technology involvement! @Tesla is just on the air! BMW is just in the oil!
4114 2018-10-16 17:19:22 Whatever this is, it looks like its sitting in old, hardened oil 
4115 2018-10-16 17:19:22 Celebrating additions to #overpopulation is like congratulating someone for an oil spill! Why celebrate a choice that was preventable while killing the environment?
4116 2018-10-16 17:19:21 I've been giving my cat CBD oil and now he won't quit telling everybody that he's an Atheist and how much he loves Rage Against the Machine.
4117 2018-10-16 17:19:19 If we would aggressively pursue electric vehicles...we wouldn’t need oil from these sadistic murderers. What ever happened to an “Energy independent” America?
4118 2018-10-16 17:19:17 The top 100 polluters are almost exclusively coal and oil companies, which means no amount of regulation will actually *fix* the problem. These are industries that need to disappear to see real environmental progress...

4121 2018-10-16 17:19:08 Boy you're in the wrong state trying to pull that snake oil salesmen crap.  The good people of Texas can see right through your bs.
4122 2018-10-16 17:19:07 Spoiler Alert ...except for Isreal all middle east countries are brutal dictatorships run by despots that imprison and murder their own citizens ....BUT...Since the Saudis keep Iran in check, buy our arms  sell us oil ...I Dont Care....the enemy of our enemy is our friend.

4125 2018-10-16 17:18:41 A little bit of tea tree oil sis, right around the nose right before you go to bed! 7-10 min before you wind down. Also a little meditation and try to stay off electronic devices. Any LED light or screen lights can stimulate the brain in ways that could induce insomnia.
4126 2018-10-16 17:18:35 When it comes to #HumanRights the #Iranian government takes #journalists hostage and releases them for large sums of money. The #Saudis killed and CHOPPED a journalist in a third country. I’d like to see #Trump sanctioning their oil based economy.
4127 2018-10-16 17:18:35 Until Nov 1941, USA was a major source of oil for Japan. even after they invaded China in 1937 and was carrying out awful atrocities. Roosevelt also turned back Jewish refugees and interned Japanese American citizens. Read a book!
4128 2018-10-16 17:18:35 Why do we still worry what owners of oil cars are going through. Haven't we breathed in their exhaust and stepped in their oily parking spots enough?
4129 2018-10-16 17:18:35 Their pulsating schlong topped with olive oil with flakes of oregano rubbed against their painted world

4136 2018-10-16 17:18:04 Robert Kubica has today held a meeting with @PKN_ORLEN 

A very wealthy oil company, could this be the sponsorship he needs to secure the final @WilliamsRacing seat?
4137 2018-10-16 17:17:36 I am the user of Pontiac vibe 2005 modem .I used oil lubricant 5w30 covers 13166531 as speedometer. My dealer is saying I should use 5w40 as a result of mileage covered.I would like to know if it is tangible.thanks.
4138 2018-10-16 17:17:33 May God bless you on your path Charles! Please try Rick Simpson CBD oil and do an alkaline diet

1.Small islands 
2. Large advanced economies
3. Oil rich gulf states 

Does it makes sense for #Zambia to operate on sales tax 
4147 2018-10-16 17:17:10 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
4148 2018-10-16 17:17:07 I think he's the only reason why beard oil is still a thing. His beard is his personality.
4149 2018-10-16 17:16:59 The constant threat by OPEC members raising oil & gas prices beyond affordability; makes it IMPERATIVE that we use the time, the space, the technology to build the wind farms, the solar stations on EVERY roof & highway, so that we can utilize our OWN clean energy. Its a Win/Win.
4150 2018-10-16 17:16:56 Day 1: Irv Wiehe, President of Soluble Solutions will present "Self-incompatibility, the Stain of West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil—Blending of Tight oil, WCS, MSW"

After shower I try to air dry after a quick blot,then coconut oil until dried &if it’s Before bed I put Vaseline on after the coconut oil especially on my hands, feet & face.
4152 2018-10-16 17:16:18 100 hour weeks arent shit if they're getting compensated. It's literally the status quo. Work REALLY feckin hard until release, then get adequate time off for the work they put in. Ask literally any profession that works that time. Oil field, er staff, military personnel etc.

4156 2018-10-16 17:16:09 It’s the Saudi’s murder of Khashoggi. It looks like the WH is involved/complicit with helping to come up with a plausible explanation so the US can go on with weapons sales and don’t lose any oil in the process. Rogue assassins my ass! 
This show reminds me of Midnight Express!
4157 2018-10-16 17:16:07 Bruhz and Nupes. I need endless amounts of oil and skittles this weekend. Thank you in advance guys

4162 2018-10-16 17:15:36 The occasional splatters of hot oil on the exposed tum tum really gets one going, no?
4163 2018-10-16 17:15:26 @Justbuy_ng ,oh yes it is. It is common knowledge that tax is the new oil, thus government agencies are putting their might into enforcement of levies, taxes and all what note.
A couple of clients and individuals are currently facing 'visitations' from Local Government Councils.
4164 2018-10-16 17:15:23 Did I say that? Sorry for your assumption.
t-rump is an (un)reality-TV version of PT Barnum.
saudi-israelia has one big-money goal: oil/gas pipeline from s/a+uae to the EU.
Bulldoze anything that gets in the way.
They're trying to impeach t-rump bc

4166 2018-10-16 17:15:19 'other issues' why can't you spell it out the way it is 'we can not ignore the Murder of Jamal #khashoogi' why are you economical with words here. If it were Iran, we would have heard words like 'Fire and Furry'.
Sorry Saudi is not on the axis of Evil, they have good Oil.
4167 2018-10-16 17:15:16 i hate going into grease monkey to get an oil change because they always tell me “well you might need to get this done and that done” and i’m like yeah probably but i’m too broke pls don’t make me feel bad for not getting anything else taken care of other than my oil

4178 2018-10-16 17:14:22 I learned back in the George W. Bush days. Republicans will deny climate change to favor the oil companies until the earth becomes uninhabitable.
4179 2018-10-16 17:14:13 Nigerian CPKO price uptrend continues, rising 4.4% to N355k today from N340k last week Friday as global edible oil prices rise and local refiners compete for seasonal demand storage.
4180 2018-10-16 17:14:11 You never answer me, what about the Wayne National Forest? It is Ohio’s only national forest and it is being leased for oil and gas. Shame, shame, shame
4181 2018-10-16 17:14:11 Oil 80 a Barrel. Prices been going up. Prices might go up more if issues persist and opec raises prices. When do they go down?  Im starting to think companies are the issue. When barrel prices go down they stay the same...not go down...random thought of the day.
4182 2018-10-16 17:13:49 So if the Saudi’s send oil rocketing to $200/bbl Canada will see what $35/bbl?   Ring the register!!!
4183 2018-10-16 17:13:46 They can't do much right now because of their oil reliance, maybe when Cyprus launches their oil production big time and then maybe sth. will happen
4184 2018-10-16 17:13:44 Sitting waiting for my oil to get changed. I love when people listen to videos or music without ear phones! 
4185 2018-10-16 17:13:39 @VelshiRuhle America should've been investing Oil Subsidies into Solar & Wind years ago knowing America is dependent on oil- We could be much more independent by now- Only the Ignorance of Greed would continue to give oil handouts knowing we're dependent on Autocracies now-
4186 2018-10-16 17:13:34 What #opec did to oil is noteworthy, helped by sanctions never the less. They raised the price of their national asset. And we did exactly the opposite. Oil price can be 25 or 200 , countries need to manage their finances

4228 2018-10-16 17:10:03 .@amysiskind –– And POTUS will be okay with all of this because it benefits his family. Previous administrations have also turned a blind eye to Saudi crimes against humanity all because of oil/money. We penalize other nations for human rights violations, but never Saudi Arabia.
4229 2018-10-16 17:09:55 Uhhhh, Saudi Arabia has enough of its own oil to fuel anything. Terrorists always use civilians as human shields.  I thought you might know that.
4230 2018-10-16 17:09:54 Lavender + tea tree oil on ur locs is the best combo ever 
4231 2018-10-16 17:09:46 This is only a shock to people who haven’t been paying attention to geo-politics the last 100 years. Might read “The Prize” by Daniel Yergin for a pretty good history of the oil business.
4232 2018-10-16 17:09:36 dating to the Civil war, Republicans have been about complete voting access for all citizens. It is the Demcorats that vote alphabettically from the grave.

4238 2018-10-16 17:09:03 It’s simple.  It’ll be a Sweep & Clear.  I’ll show no mercy.
4239 2018-10-16 17:09:01 Day 1: Sandy Fielden, director of oil research from @MstarCandE will present "Gulf Coast Crude Exports"

4249 2018-10-16 17:08:25 Yep..They let it slide because it is oil producing Saudi Arabia. No morals. Just money.
4250 2018-10-16 17:08:20 Because of oil, we have a better standard of Living, longer lifespan, clean water, clean air, A house, a car, schools, and better “MEDICATION”   Denying this standard of living to our children and grandchildren is to send them back into the pass where living was harsh.
4251 2018-10-16 17:08:10 Girl that was me last year I FEEL you 100% just take biotin and do hair mask. I did black castor oil and massaged it in for months and also bought this hair growth serum cuz I could only wear headbands to cover it. That bad.
4252 2018-10-16 17:08:07 If you are airbnb host who says you have a full kitchen, but have zero spices or cooking oil in your cabinets you are the worst kind of liar!!!!!!!!!

4254 2018-10-16 17:07:57 Si soy trans me dejan el gas oil mas barato?
4255 2018-10-16 17:07:53 Republicans always say the tax cuts will pay for themselves & it’s never worked. Cheney said the Iraq war would pay for itself with the oil we’d get. Republicans lie, lie, lie!
4256 2018-10-16 17:07:42 Lol when you have an analog governor in a digital age
4257 2018-10-16 17:07:14 Speaking of level maybe we should level saudia arabia and gas will be 50 cents a gallon after we take over the oil wells we built.
4258 2018-10-16 17:07:13 @AliVelshi I don't believe that the USA gets any oil from Saudi Arabia.  Europe does, not the US,  Check it out.
4259 2018-10-16 17:07:09 最近のデフォはs4までいってそこまで悪いプレーしてないのに10連敗w
4260 2018-10-16 17:07:07 SaudiArabia is owned by the Saud family. They have been put in place to guard the oil wells after FUKUS pulled out. That whole family is CIA. Remember Prince Bandar Bush? He created AlQaeda/ISIS for America.
4261 2018-10-16 17:07:04 Day 1: Hillary Stevenson, Director of Oil Markets & Business Development from 
@genscape will present "Global Production Trends Relative to US Imports"
4262 2018-10-16 17:07:03 Do something more specific! Like Lucas, for Lucas Oil. Or some shit like that!
4263 2018-10-16 17:07:02 Need to get me an oil change tomorrow 
4264 2018-10-16 17:06:59 When you are dependent on foreign oil, the deal is more important than morals!
4265 2018-10-16 17:06:47 Yes, but the analogy is working as people tend to say that data is the XXIst Century’s oil.
4266 2018-10-16 17:06:43 my dawg slicker than oil.. iannn lying
4267 2018-10-16 17:06:40 I'll oil my whole scalp and hair from root to tip. Next day its dry an crunchy asf
4268 2018-10-16 17:06:33 Robert Kubica has today held a meeting with @PKN_ORLEN 

A very wealthy oil company, could this be the sponsorship he needs to secure the final @WilliamsRacing seat? 

#Williams #USGP #F1 #RK #Formula1
4269 2018-10-16 17:06:30 They are also why Venezuelan oil hasn't been banned;)
4270 2018-10-16 17:06:19 Hydrogenated oil is banned now. Its really bad for you xD.
4271 2018-10-16 17:06:18 ههههههههههههه حلوه
4272 2018-10-16 17:06:15 Woman, stop that. We need to go back to where we are coming from. If we go back, dollar we be #198-1$, Rice will back to #7,000, petrol will back to #97, ground nut oil will back to #6,500, unemployment rate will reduce. So, stop deceiving us. We know what we want. Buhari is bad.
4273 2018-10-16 17:06:13 Yes, lets take a deep look into middle east oil money and which of our politicians/parties are eating from that trough.. That won't go well for Democrats.. Let's take a deep look into where Chinese money is going into politicians pockets while we are at it..
4274 2018-10-16 17:06:00 @__ssiieerraa__ & I made cookies last night w/out butter. We used olive oil instead and wow they still came out dank af
4275 2018-10-16 17:05:51 they’re the ones that charged me $1400 for the oil leak and then someone else told me later that i still had an oil leak!

4277 2018-10-16 17:05:47 Accidentally dipping my fingers in a vat of boiling hot oil was quite possibly one of the stupidest things I’ve ever done
4278 2018-10-16 17:05:43 As transparent as a million barrels of crude oil.
4279 2018-10-16 17:05:39 I'm assuming y'all took into account all of the O&G companies that went out of business,  had to lay off half to two-thirds of their workforce to survive Obama and OPEC's war on American oil.
4280 2018-10-16 17:05:30 just got my oil changed & a car wash. 
4281 2018-10-16 17:05:25 I recommend you do your own research tbh. Because if I send you something, it may seem biased lol.

Just know that Big Oil & Gas is behind both propositions so that will help you see things a bit more clearly.
4282 2018-10-16 17:05:24 or remove sanctions on Iran. That brought the price of oil down.
4283 2018-10-16 17:05:20 Dear Sir. I am trying connect with respected Asad Umar, Fawad Chaudhry and Minister Petroleum to share a business model on how we can increase foreign investment in oil and gas industry, but no success to reach them. May i seek your assistance in this matter please?
4284 2018-10-16 17:05:18 No law will stop me from illegally telling people that truth about cannabis oil being the cancer cure! Arrest if they DARE!
4285 2018-10-16 17:05:15 The @McLarenF1 version from my day was collapsible. The solenoid stuck on @therealdcf1 at Monaco 2002, we had to rattle it via telemetry to free it up. It was there because our oil consumption was absymal due to a burr on the oil control ring groove in the piston. Nice win thou'
4286 2018-10-16 17:05:14 Is that the leaking oil or the bald tires?
4287 2018-10-16 17:05:05 わかっちゃいるんですけど、勝ってる試合でバロン前とかに一人でガンガン相手のジャングル入ってキャッチされてバロンとられたりしまくってるともうどうしていいかわからん

4288 2018-10-16 17:05:00 We hate coming to the dealership to get my oil changed... But it's free
4289 2018-10-16 17:04:55 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed #TexasDebate
4290 2018-10-16 17:04:54 From what I’ve read it has nothing to do with oil, it’s about Trump not wanting to risk his private financial dealings with them. Oh, and billions in arms deals. Maybe.
4291 2018-10-16 17:04:47 Nibblin' on sponge cake,
Watchin' the sun bake;
All of those tourists covered with oil.
Strummin' my six string on my front porch swing.

They're beginnin' to boil.
4292 2018-10-16 17:04:44 If you didn’t know, Aushwitz was a slave labor camp and they primarily manufactured synthetic oil. This was only made possible by Rockefellers standard oil giving them the knowledge on how to produce it

4294 2018-10-16 17:04:38 Everybody knows you need to marinate squirrel brains and offles , ¼ cup apple cider (or apple juice)
¼ cup Worcestershire sauce.
1 tsp dried rosemary.
2 tsp garlic powder, or 2 cloves garlic, crushed.
1 tbsp olive oil.
1 tsp sea salt.
½ tsp ground black pepper.
4295 2018-10-16 17:04:35 Oil changes are the lowest priority because they're usually either not very profitable or not profitable at all. Most car shops lose money on non-synthetic oil changes because they hope the customer will come back with a real problem. Change your own oil to save $10-$20.
4296 2018-10-16 17:04:34 They knew they were lying, they just figured no one else  would notice  until after the midterms. Anyone with a basic understanding of math knew the GOP was selling economic snake oil. #TaxScam

4298 2018-10-16 17:04:28 #Botswana is about as dependent on diamond mining as #Nigeria is on #oil. But the country has taken several steps to fend off the typical problems. To prevent its currency from gyrating, and its other exports from losing competitiveness, it accumulated foreign-exchange reserves.
4299 2018-10-16 17:04:25 Why doesn’t BAE start building solar farms instead of weapons, and sell them to the Saudis who can then generate power batteries with the vast quantities of sun they get all year round instead of oil. I know storage is still an issue, but it’s improving on a regular basis.
4300 2018-10-16 17:04:16 It’s not good to hear your car up before you go. It makes the oil like sludge, it messes up your engine in many ways. We have to defrost someone’s but I don’t wait for it to heat up. Gotta take care of my lovely Honda.
4301 2018-10-16 17:04:13 Sending the poor off to foreign lands to secure oil and poppy fields for corporate interests: America!

4307 2018-10-16 17:03:42 I hear Scotland's - sorry UK - oil revenue this year is only going to be a paltry £48bn. No wonder we couldn't manage that deficit the UK has lumbered us with eh?
4308 2018-10-16 17:03:37 ALERT ALERT........TO ALL TRULY ANOINTED PREACHERS. STOP WAISTING YOUR OIL ON WATERED-DOWN CHURCHES. OIL AND WATER DONT MIX.
4309 2018-10-16 17:03:34 Full synthetic oil changes <<<<<
4310 2018-10-16 17:03:31  aren’t you all going out of business.. thanks but no thanks. As well as my oil changes are free!  good luck with your future endeavors.
4311 2018-10-16 17:03:23 Peak oil has been a thing on-and-off since at least the mid 1920's
Oil production cost is technology driven
Current oil prices are going up due to Iran-US conflict
Big issue for EV will be the renewable-electricity cost of production and required back-ups when wind is unavailable
4312 2018-10-16 17:03:20 Wtf even is an oil show? Y’all niggas never seen oil before? It’s not that interesting.

4315 2018-10-16 17:03:07 Also, were it not for idiocy we’d have begun the move to solar power decades ago. We’ve had the technology for a century. But, solar panels do have a lower profit margin than oil or coal...

4322 2018-10-16 17:02:25 Understand me this. Steal and shock/charger lock (the oil though)/palm oil sandwich ? How come I don't get it ?
4323 2018-10-16 17:02:18 Now, #oil prices are rising again, which will take some pressure off of the economy, but which could present its own set of problems. #Nigeria heavily subsidizes fuel for consumers, as a way of maintaining social stability --
4324 2018-10-16 17:02:13 Yes yes yes and money stepped in and lied to Americans we would be better to bring this to a head & stop Americans from dying & paying just have oil. In 50 yrs they will be a little non nation fighting to stay in power.
4325 2018-10-16 17:01:55 Pro tip- sulfates are not always bad for your hair. Coconut oil should never be used as a treatment or leave in. Nothing topical (other than Bosley, etc) will make your hair grow, and you need more vitamins than biotin. Seasonal hair loss is normal. You can’t stop it. And lastly,
4326 2018-10-16 17:01:54 Might do a oil and lube job on ya first :)

4333 2018-10-16 17:01:21 Indeed, instability and violence are features of the resource curse -- when government revenue depends heavily on #oil, political control represents a tempting prize for would-be coup leaders and revolutionaries

4336 2018-10-16 17:01:17 I just want to feel the oil drip from my neck and coalesce with my drool as it puddles at my big, fat, wealthy feet...
4337 2018-10-16 17:01:11 Different oil viscosities will affect how the oil reacts to different temperatures. In colder weather, oil can become thicker and harder to move through an engine.

#khashogi
4354 2018-10-16 17:00:05 How is this hate speech? We have oil.We sell it outside the country. We need to not let anyone outside interests control what we pay. It's like importing wheat. We don't need to.
4355 2018-10-16 17:00:02 The game seems to be over and you lost. A bit tired of seeing you and your snake oil salesman of a lawyer on my tv and social media feeds desperate for attention.
4356 2018-10-16 16:59:48 It also exposes a country to risk. #Oil prices are volatile. When prices fall, as they often do, it can be disastrous for an oil-dependent economy. During the 1980s, #Nigerians actually got steadily poorer, as oil prices fell
4357 2018-10-16 16:59:41 Cuticle oil?
4358 2018-10-16 16:59:35 Does that include the Middle East Oil Sheikhs, Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates Warren Buffet, countless Russian & Chinese oligarchs, Koch Bros, Carlos Slim, Sultan of Brunei. I dont think any of these are Jewish

4372 2018-10-16 16:58:22 I am disappointed in feminism becoming a brand now instead of people knowing what it actually means. Actresses like Amina Sheikh are using it for their advantage to sell oil but sat with Sanam Saeed tight lipped when she was shaming the movement. Please be original! #MeriAwaz
4373 2018-10-16 16:58:16 I only took my car back to @chapmanjeep for the free oil change but instantly regretting it. Stood in the lobby for 5 minutes and no one even acknowledged me. It’s probably worth the $40 to go to jiffy lube next time. 
4374 2018-10-16 16:58:11 Guess you'd consider those 'roughnecks' pumping your oil, or the GI's on the battlefield, in the same vein. You prefer manicured fingers pilfering our treasury, and limiting more of our freedoms ....as your preferred 'company'. Hypocrisy.
4375 2018-10-16 16:58:08 Raising taxes would help. So would ending handouts to profit making oil companies and ending tax credits so companies who make millions/billions don't pay a dime.
4376 2018-10-16 16:57:41 Nothin really lol. I use to do cocont oil but I’ve been slacking on it . I just wash it once a week and i try not to use any heat on it if i don’t need to. So I’m pretty much nappy all the time unles i got somewhere to be  lmaoo

2. Pipelines to move oil from Alaska going slow, will be blocked due to spills
3. Acceptance of Euros for payment limited value of petrodollar
4. Russia oil
5. China skyrocketing demand for oil due to industrialization
4381 2018-10-16 16:56:58 The economic benefits of oil far outweighs the fear of climate change. Climate change is not what you mitigate; it's what you deal with drastically.

4504 2018-10-16 16:47:50 Today Trump is claiming that Jamal Koshoggi committed suicide, dismembered his own body, stuffed himself in an oil barrel and threw himself into the Bosporus.
4505 2018-10-16 16:47:37 Who will pick up supplies if MBS decides to cut production? I would not short #oil here way too much political risk.
4506 2018-10-16 16:47:32 Came to get an oil change and a new tire () and it’s going to take an hour and a half so looks like I have a long lunch
4507 2018-10-16 16:47:28 Libs allow wealthy, pedal-pushing urban hippies and natives nostalgic for the 15th century - two groups insulated from oil price increases - to sabotage our efforts to secure our energy supply while our gov't leaders provoke vile Saudis & invite further economic peril. Suicide.

4509 2018-10-16 16:47:18 Do you have physical journos or you use other people's twitter accounts to get your info. That cooking oil may be available in those closed shops because in shops like pnp they had it but not on shelves. You had to buy a certain amount of goods to get one 2 litter bottle.

4511 2018-10-16 16:47:16 I think i'm gonna whip it up tonight. I like to use the BBQ for any oil cooking (cause it stinks up the house) I just get a cheap, deep, foil pan from the dollar store and put that on the grill.
4512 2018-10-16 16:47:13 Wile always gave us that final puff of dust, a sublime finishing touch! Today's cartoons lack that artistry, but maybe I'm prejudiced
4513 2018-10-16 16:47:10 While running to their broker to buy oil...
4514 2018-10-16 16:47:10 I think she/he/whoever is scamming someone I know. Looks like her acct is suspended. Trying to follow some breadcrumbs. Said she was in Tx and her Dad was in oil but she is trying to get money?!? My friend is not tech savy.

4521 2018-10-16 16:46:33 I love you, Brad. Bring it in for a hug that smells like chainsaw grease and oil. You may also find a few wood chips or bits of gore on your shirt, after.
4522 2018-10-16 16:46:30 so it looks like Trump and USA are going to do nothing about Saudi Arabia murdering Khashoggi, despite Trump initially saying that Saudi Arabia would have to pay for it....

Money talks, especially oil money that the US needs. Standard stuff really

4525 2018-10-16 16:46:26 I declare I will take over the Texan Oilfields and use the profits from sales of the oil to countries of my choosing to fund  charities of my choosing. USA has no rights to Texas Oilfields as it's mine! Sounds ridiculous and offensive? That's what the USA is doing now 
4526 2018-10-16 16:46:23 @USNATO norway's economy is based upon oil.
4527 2018-10-16 16:46:23 @vrothernate you rub warm baby oil on your stomach so you can fall asleep
4528 2018-10-16 16:46:22 In this season, it is necessary that you keep a small bottle of oil or lotion on you at all times and put that tendency to be ashy in its place... #psa #fya #fall #lotion
4529 2018-10-16 16:46:21 I paid each time I went for my root canal treatment, which was 3 times. Though the pain I felt leading up to my appointment and all the clove oil I practically drank, I would have given my life savings!
4530 2018-10-16 16:46:20 Okay, ladies. I’m attempting to get my hair in formation with a deep conditioning protein pack, coconut oil, argan oil, a microwave, and a kroger bag.
4531 2018-10-16 16:46:18 Explains everything. You can feel the production is not right. They were trying to mix water and oil
4532 2018-10-16 16:46:13 By freeing up innovation through a cash cow killing, the US will surge ahead to greatness far beyond anything Trump is erecting out of old, brittle paper mâché. Cash cows like the #Coal & Oil have been holding back #innovation for 40 yrs. We must end their milking of our #future!
4533 2018-10-16 16:46:02 NC Oil & Gas Commission planing a field trip . But with no drilling applications and no permits at the moment, "it seems that taking a field trip is giant waste of taxpayer money," @BrooksSELC says during public comment
4534 2018-10-16 16:46:01 Vitamin E oil is one of my new favorite things.  I want to just soak my hands in it for the next hour.  LOL
4535 2018-10-16 16:46:00 So today I learnt that “Oando” is actually O and O, which is short for ocean and oil. 
Did I just teach u that?

4537 2018-10-16 16:45:49 What’s a good place I’m Fairfield to get an oil change 
4538 2018-10-16 16:45:48 Oil did something that i definitely should have seen. As soon as it happened i was like “oh, right”. Still heading down but now there’s a new trade setup.
4539 2018-10-16 16:45:46 Dry cleaning favours the removal of grease and oil based stains whereas wet cleaning favours water based stains. 
4540 2018-10-16 16:45:45 But, but, but, fossil fuel is a theory.
Peak Oil was a sham.
Climate Change is a hoax!

If you are tired of Big Oil doing as they please and you care about protecting public health/safety, I urge you to vote YES on Prop 11 and NO on Amendment 74.
4542 2018-10-16 16:45:41 “Get educated.” How about “don’t bark orders at people whose minds you’re trying to change.” Honestly, nothing in this article is a win. We’re moving backward by focusing on oil & coal instead of shifting our labor force to alternative energies, which actually creates more jobs.

4546 2018-10-16 16:45:28 If only lemon water, coconut oil, and face masks could solve all my real problems.
4547 2018-10-16 16:45:28 And just for you to label us something or to say “just 1k fall”- there’s ILFS, there’s a credit & liquidity squeeze on some HFCs, there’s oil prices that shot up, currency, there’s Iran, there’s 4th Nov in USA, 1st Jan addnl tariffs on China & our political landscape.

4559 2018-10-16 16:44:31 This is KSA and its power, it is not only oil, it is not only money, it is more than that, it is the history and it is the heart of world and center of Islam. What makes USA in such power position was the relation with Saudi Arabia.

4562 2018-10-16 16:44:18 Why is this even a thing? Were none of the warnings of #fracking's dangers to the planet and its inhabitants heeded by any politician, policy maker, anyone who could stop human beings from doing anything so incredibly stupid? Did humanity learn nothing from coal, oil, nuclear?
4563 2018-10-16 16:44:13 The oil and gas industry has been subsidized by tax payers for way too long. Quit drilling within a baseball throw of schools.
4564 2018-10-16 16:44:10 Obama had us getting away from the Saudi oil, Trump loves the Saudi money. Do the math.

4574 2018-10-16 16:43:44 Add to those benefits the thousands more jobs than the oil sands created. The revenues and health benefits.
4575 2018-10-16 16:43:40 Is that a reference to peak oil? I wonder what the first "peak" was? I always LOVE your social criticism, satire, and commentary. I was jaw-droppingly stunned at the suggestion that I bitch about the world too much, to use her words, as if we should all just accept things!

4578 2018-10-16 16:43:23 Perhaps he’s going to get the oil.
4579 2018-10-16 16:43:21 Obama is worth like 400% more than he was before he was president. Bill gets like half a mill just for a speaking engagement and W. Bush is still cleaning house on the oil business

4629 2018-10-16 16:39:21 Actually, North Korea is sitting on more than $5 trillion of natural resources of rare metals. No oil, though.

Same goes with  Afghanistan. Lithium, gold, copper, as well as natural gas. It’s basically one of the main reasons we’re still there.

4633 2018-10-16 16:39:14 The way to pwn Saudi Barbaria regarding their bluster of an “oil weapon” threat would be to promise that we will replace any incremental barrel they deny us with a barrel from Iran. MBS would probably have an aneurism.

4636 2018-10-16 16:39:06 I have to drive my moms car because my car is hemorrhaging oil so that means the chocolate covered almonds in the glove box are officially mine for the next few days
4637 2018-10-16 16:39:05 -We are surplus to requirements.
-They can use Asians for slave labour.
-We're living on top of the stuff they want. Oil, cobalt, diamonds, gold...and water.
-They've built enough military bases here to keep us in line. Now they need to test their new "boomboom" toys.
4638 2018-10-16 16:39:04 Why we are selling our oil too cheap ? 80$ for a Barrel ! In return we buy a 50ml perfume 100$ !!

I wish we Reduce our production by half to get same income and keep the rest for our generations ! This world don’t Appreciate what Saudi are doing to keep the oil price low .

4640 2018-10-16 16:38:50 So if wwe shouldn't go to Saudi Arabia, why are we still buying oil from them? So some businesses should be affected while others arent? Forget the moral grandstanding people
4641 2018-10-16 16:38:49 Canada is a net importer of Saudi Arabia oil. We are filling their coffers instead of buying our own production. Do the people know this? And do they know the Saudis just liquidated their Canadian assets?

4645 2018-10-16 16:38:41 Yeah. Maybe we'll buy less oil from them for a day or two.
4646 2018-10-16 16:38:39 You’re a “car girl” but you can’t even change your own oil.
4647 2018-10-16 16:38:24 Shay also gave me a sample of unite hair oil and it's so bomb
4648 2018-10-16 16:38:18 We don’t want to manipulated into another illegal war by a murderous dictatorship, an insane Prime Minister, Big Oil, the Military Industrial Complex and Neocons. Selling weapons to dictators who bomb civilians only increases terrorism against the USA leading to Never Ending War.

4650 2018-10-16 16:38:00 politics is also about power, and saudi arabia has been the lap dog of the US. Also they produce 12 mi. barrel oil a day, that is why they have a political leg to stand on. politics is not about morality.
4651 2018-10-16 16:37:58 You need to add oil to protect the surface.  Just think your table is protected now you can use the same for the wood surface.
4652 2018-10-16 16:37:54 if you ever switched from mainly bud to mainly oil did you end up saving or losing money?

4663 2018-10-16 16:36:56 passed on an old man doing 50 on the highway who was smoking an enormous cigar while texting. he looked like an evil oil baron
4664 2018-10-16 16:36:46 Yes agreed. End of coal growth at very high levels bankrupted industry, but individual consumer was not a driver, as you point out, like they are/will be in EV. California remains the early warning domain for autos/oil as EV sales share heads to 10% + petrol demand already flat.
4665 2018-10-16 16:36:37 Grab a few toilet seat covers to cut up into 2-inch squares. These are great for soaking up excess oil on your face.
4666 2018-10-16 16:36:35 I have to have an oil change, new brakes, and new tires all at one time and cars are so expensive. I wanna have a break down lol
4667 2018-10-16 16:36:33 Can we go back to a time where snake oil salesman just sold snake oil tonics and not cultish ideas that have no standing in reality?

4673 2018-10-16 16:36:19 She was NEVER anti oil or pipelines! That is a lie perpetrated by the UCP. This picture was at a LEAP rally TWO YEARS before the election! They wanted her to adopt their anti pipeline manifesto which we all know she refused to the chagrin of the federal NDP. & that’s not Phillips
4674 2018-10-16 16:36:02 Oh, because right-wing news is always true? Anything that turns out true ends up being called "Fake News" all because it fits an extreme right-wing narrative only hungry for oil and money. 

Stop buying oil from countries that repress its people's individual freedoms.

4686 2018-10-16 16:35:20 There's a shop near me that has casks full of real olive oil of many varieties. All unadulterated, just fill your bottle. But I still like avocado oil...
4687 2018-10-16 16:35:17 @24hrtranslation For an oil change in a local area, I would build a resource of all facilities in the area + the different types of oil , their properties and the pricing - make yourself an authority in the market :)  #vcbuzz
4688 2018-10-16 16:35:14 Right- then they developed ”Low Erucic Acid” rapeseed in Canada & named it Canola for ” Canadian Oil”. I have seen on the USA. Canola oil certified less than 1% erucic acid- never seen it in Canada.
4689 2018-10-16 16:35:09 If our government made less war for oil and instead helped other countries into the 21 century we could consider ourselves a nation,under God.  Instead we are a nation of selfish humans who only care that they have all the latest toys.

4708 2018-10-16 16:33:42 Peppermint oil has done wonders for me when it comes to centipedes. When I first moved into my apartment they were the worst. Now I haven't seen one in at least 8 months. (knock on wood that I don't find one when I come home tonight)

4710 2018-10-16 16:33:30 Saudi Arabia's oil business with India has nothing to do in concern with its history of funding terrorist groups. If anything, its oil exports have only shut countries up from further exposing the truth of the Kingdom's human rights abuses.

4761 2018-10-16 16:29:36 Use any hair oil like olive oil or coconut oil on damp hair. Applying oil or product on damp hair absorbs better.

4763 2018-10-16 16:29:34 19 of 21 hijackers on 9/11 were from Saudi Arabia? No accountability, it has always been about oil & business. Congress must act if our President fails to do so. Our values & principles must be our guides, the Saudi's are not the shinning light in the Middle East, beware?

4771 2018-10-16 16:28:57 Trump admin sure likes yuckking it up w/world’s worst dictators. Their outrage about Adam Warmbier lasted less time than it took to bury him & they can’t even pretend outrage about the murder of Khashoggi because oil & he’s not even a US citizen. But Cuba sanctions must go on.
4772 2018-10-16 16:28:55 Can you reconcile this with all the scientific evidence of the past 30 years; such as the food pyramid, cholesterol and eggs are bad and benefits of corn oil, canola oil and  artificial sweetners.  Or anecdotal evidence of elimination diets such as carnivore??

4778 2018-10-16 16:28:24 I was talking to my Dad about how to change oil in my car. About 20 minutes later a video on my youtube feed popped up from CBS about oil change scams at big companies. Someone or something is listening to you at all times.

4790 2018-10-16 16:27:30 Oil companies follow a set procedure to determine the selling price. It is based on last 15 days average crude price.Thus there is a time lag between pump price and crude price.

4801 2018-10-16 16:25:54 Yengeni and common sense is like water and oil. It’s like corrupt cadres and tenderpreneurs don’t get it that the government is running out of money. To them the VAT hike means nothing.

4805 2018-10-16 16:25:45 Sim, isso eu também acho

4808 2018-10-16 16:25:06 Brexit is an oxymoron, an impossibility, an attempt to combine the vinegar of fantasy with the oil of reality. Chequers is mayonnaise, and it won’t stay together. The cabinet have again today swerved this final truth. Is tomorrow in Brussels AT LAST the end of the fantasy?
4809 2018-10-16 16:25:01 Correct. And, may I add, that’s an incredibly ignorant statement, economically & politically speaking. Bc America’s wealth isn’t tied solely to oil prices. Like Venezuela. Nor do we have an authoritarian government. Well, at least not yet. The right is working on that now...
4810 2018-10-16 16:24:56 What kinda oil please? Just curious.
4811 2018-10-16 16:24:47 Did anyone think it would play out differently. Trump in his own words told us how much money his company gets from Saudi Arabia, and their $$$ and oil means more to him as President then a slaughtered, dismembered journalist and human rights abuse.  1/

I was hungry and we only had garri, palm oil, some seasoning cubes and of course, salt.
I decided to experiment and prepare palm oil garri jollof.
If not for God, I would have burnt the house.

4821 2018-10-16 16:23:57 The markets, neither stocks or oil, are reacting to this event at all. This is a Deep State tactic to try to force Trump’s hand. Q asked “How do you start a war?” This will blow up in the faces of the DS, Dems, and Cavuto. Notice Neal really pushing this story. He needs to go!!
4822 2018-10-16 16:23:53 I agree that when the demand decline comes, it will be dramatic. It's the price decline that's coming sooner than expected and the disruption of both oil and auto industries that will take place, imo, well in advance of the demand decline. End of coal growth instructive, here.

They are producing pretty much flat out with very little spare & they are not in the business of undercutting anyone. As for $ vs € my take is if $ oil price falls it falls

4883 2018-10-16 16:20:03 Umm.. it’s largely because of the Global (Brent) oil price. It’s at $80 per barrel. It has increased from an average of $55 per barrel last November. Botswana is not insulated from international markets.
4884 2018-10-16 16:19:52 We hear you. This is a really important issue and we’ve been driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years.  We’re on track to meet our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.
4885 2018-10-16 16:19:46 In fact the only security London still has to "offer" for borrowing is Scottish oil revenue.
4886 2018-10-16 16:19:44 You know for sure there's no oil in Dr. Pepper??

4890 2018-10-16 16:19:30 I just want a nice meaty southern man who will wear overalls without a shirt when he changes my oil and tells me the only thing sweeter than the tea I made is me. Is that too much to ask for.
4891 2018-10-16 16:19:30 Oh wait. Bush didn’t want his oil dealings with Bin Laden to go a rye. Silly me.

"They could totally make cars that don't need oil, but they don't cause they want to keep us dependent on Big Oil. Exxon pays off the politicians to hide the evidence of climate change to keep us all paying to stay on that sweet oil teat. "

4901 2018-10-16 16:18:48 Unemployment has only dropped less than a percentage when dropping from over 10 percent after Bush to 4.1 percent under Obama. Isis is still active and we still depend on oil. Middle class tax breaks expire next year, trump had nothing to do with the summits it Korea...
4902 2018-10-16 16:18:43 Support Tesla, buy a car, buy some stock. Best avenue of action for an individual to make a difference. If enough do, we can kill big oil. Encourage others to do so. Yes, I own stock.
4903 2018-10-16 16:18:34 Freeze Saudi investments and assets in the US, and take control of oil fields until Arabian nation choose their president and government.

4916 2018-10-16 16:17:47 Looks like Trump will be buying the Saudi's lame excuse regarding the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul during a botched interrogation in an attempt to avoid face off with Saudi over oil. Blood is thicker than water but not oil it seems.

4918 2018-10-16 16:17:25 I used to joke that his former buddy George Bush, whose first oil venture 'Arbusto Energy' was bankrolled by bin Laden, had set him up in a basement apartment in the W.H., & Obama let him stay. Not seeing the body, coupled w/the premature death of all involved, killed that joke.

4924 2018-10-16 16:17:10 So wind energy makes up 0.66% of the worlds energy consumption in 2016. This is based on energy consumption in 100 terrawatt-hours 9tWh).

4939 2018-10-16 16:16:11 The only problem is that even if Oil goes for $500 per barrel, with the political class we have, it still won't have much of an impact in the life of the man of straw.

4943 2018-10-16 16:16:02 The 4.3 cents per litre figure is a fudge -- there is no way of determining the cost-per-litre because it is different for every oil company. The cost to the consumer depends on where they buy their gas.
4944 2018-10-16 16:15:45 It’s a 21st century version of the traveling vaudevillian/snake oil salesman. They tour America and hustle the dream of being rich like them. There is a song and dance to sell you on it

4952 2018-10-16 16:15:10 The recipe used oil rather than butter, castor sugar instead of brown and the "dough" was more like breadcrumbs by the time I'd finished.  Had to shape it into spheres to bake.  The end result was... okay.  I added another egg and some water to the second half of the batch.
4953 2018-10-16 16:15:07 Saudis are too chicken to do that because it would kill their own oil revenues. It’s just another empty threat from the bandit kingdom.
4954 2018-10-16 16:15:04 It looks good.  But I lived through Ivan, Katrina, and the BP Oil Spill.   FEMA money took months.  MRE’s are not kids favorites. And bills kept coming.

4957 2018-10-16 16:14:50 I agree. Nothing I say makes a difference to him. He believes that Al Gore's "alarmist" research was funded by oil and gas hedge funds and that the "latest" scientific research  says C02 is not a problem and that Net Zero emissions will kill off all of us. (Not kidding.)
4958 2018-10-16 16:14:49 What amazes me is that the only ones doing anything about the so called warming is USA China Russia ect Big coal oil and foreign leaders just pump the waste into the air we have to filter and guard water pollutant refs that have slowed and made it unaffordable for America company
4959 2018-10-16 16:14:42 yes, in years where there was a surplus of tax from the North Sea oil and gas the plan was to use it to fund a Scottish soverign wealth fund.
4960 2018-10-16 16:14:39 WHY  THEY  ARE HAVING THIS  DAVOS  kind of  summit.. to have  other  alternatives  from Oil   for  revenues..

4969 2018-10-16 16:13:33 @ImranKhanPTI @ShkhRasheed  to put Railways on track. You need to start goods trains with full swing. This will break the transport mafia and lessen the Oil Import bill too
4970 2018-10-16 16:13:23 » Which is what bothers me the most. Those alliance crybabies dumping oil into the fire by "horde bias" and "we aka they lost so much" doesn't make it any better. On an emotional leveln. In a discussion I usually try to keep them out as good as I can. Just sometimes » 
4971 2018-10-16 16:13:23 Cheers. Robert, FWIW, my thesis is oil will not enter dramatic decline anytime soon. Rather, that demand growth will fall to zero (also unexpected) which itself will be devastating for the industry. I see a long and frustrating plateau for oil, up to 10 years after peak growth.

Basically, assholes always prefer working with other assholes.
4979 2018-10-16 16:12:40 My guess: right now Trump is doing all he can to let Saudis know he may HAVE to do something that looks strong - rhetoric, sanctions, travel bans - & Saudis need to accept it & not respond by raising oil prices or outing his secrets. 

And once election is over, pffft! Hunkydory!

4996 2018-10-16 16:11:00 Loss of life is not involved in this particular equation. It’s all about difficulty to recover and EROI. As I said peak easy oil is gone. Fracking is harmful and the byproducts it creates are too.

5007 2018-10-16 16:10:21 Yes, I expect that to happen as well. However, in similar fashion to wind+solar, once those two technologies reach 80% penetration that battle is largely won. Every old technology has a long tail: coal, ICE, oil, will all be used in future just at low levels.

5013 2018-10-16 16:10:09 Didn’t know I had alil bit of oil left in my pen & boooyyyy I’m floatin
5014 2018-10-16 16:10:05 これ？ドレッシングっていうか廃油。
5015 2018-10-16 16:10:03 False. In the GOP primary, I supported several candidates other than Trump. Unfortunately too many fell for the snake oil pitch.
5016 2018-10-16 16:10:02 Mainly because science has better things to do than prove fairytales and leprechauns exist and angels who give invisible tablets to snake oil salesmen who want to sleep with their wifes maid.
5017 2018-10-16 16:09:57 @ThaneCityPolice @thanecityonline @malavi_sandeep @ThaneTraffic मेट्रोच्या कामामुळे आधिच अरुंद झालेला रस्ता फेरीवाल्यांमुळे अजुन अरुंद होऊन वाहतुकीस अडथळा होत आहे. ठिकाण- Indian Oil Petrol Pump च्या समोर, तत्वज्ञान विद्यापीठ जवळ, घोडबंदर रोड.
5018 2018-10-16 16:09:57 Also sat next to a poor kid who’s got into a fight and has a cut down his face. All his mates are telling him he’ll look tough and all the girls are telling him girls love scars. He’s trying so hard not to cry. I want to tell him about Bio Oil.
5019 2018-10-16 16:09:49 I understand it’s “the classic pizza” but I just grew to love the other type of pizza. The full one i’d say. The Italian one is so…slim and dry but you like it with oil. Every time I go to Florence or Mazara I am reminded of this taste of scab. I like it, but not as much 
5020 2018-10-16 16:09:43 It’s not routine though, probs more an issue to do with the introduction of the automatic gates. Post Brexit it will ten times worse, what with all the extra checks to stop smuggling of Branston pickle one way and olive oil and chorizo the other
5021 2018-10-16 16:09:33 2 years since I tried to get out of this cruddy job and start a career in teaching.

1 year since I started to crack, the weight of this oil job and my lack of social life, and lack of progress on all but the medicinal/biological part, weighing down on me.
5022 2018-10-16 16:09:24 James read body oil, bit expensive but got the nicest colour and you can layer it up without it wearing off horribly x
5023 2018-10-16 16:09:23 So he wants to work with people who would continue SA paying danegeld to terrorists and ignoring Iran's Nuke Program? Basically a new leader for SA who will ignore their enemies slowly surrounding an oil rich nation?
5024 2018-10-16 16:09:20 How about checking the level of lube oil, level of coolant,any leakages and the starting mode if okay that is pneumatic or hydraulic or electric via batteries.
5025 2018-10-16 16:09:16 We could easily get our oil from Iran
5026 2018-10-16 16:09:13 My momma was tellin me tea tree oil prolly da best for my hair texture so ima listen appreciate that bro
5027 2018-10-16 16:09:09 No but how long can we go on like this? Just like an oil tanker with no engine streaming around little lake that’s where democracy is now
5028 2018-10-16 16:09:01 I completely respect if you're unable to release the type of oil in the product for the time being , and that they ingredients will come when the product is release. I'm just being impatient as someone who has been making his own vape juices for two years :D
5029 2018-10-16 16:08:59 Recap of last night, thanks for the oil pastels Sheri and I'll try to save you some tamales Dawn

5033 2018-10-16 16:08:35 "I apologize if that was a little tedious for some of you," says Oil & Gas commission chair after basically every word of the #fracking rules was read aloud to the panel
5034 2018-10-16 16:08:28 Legal kaha hemp seed oil here sa PH?
5035 2018-10-16 16:08:13 Some people are mixing olive oil & perfume & selling it as beard oil. Or is olive oil beard oil?
5036 2018-10-16 16:08:10 That doesn't make any sense at all  I think they just cheated you out of money. A oil change for a Honda should NEVER cost that much
5037 2018-10-16 16:08:09 Oil based fine but water based shit
5038 2018-10-16 16:08:09 Soy is in freaking *everything*.  (Uh, yeah, turns out I have a soy allergy, can't eat foods fried in soybean oil either.)
5039 2018-10-16 16:08:05 Not all cbd oil is pure.go get from hemp worx company.
5040 2018-10-16 16:07:50 coconut oil. n just wash n go, separate em when u feel like too many of em locking together. it requires no real maintenance tho, especially when they get longer.
5041 2018-10-16 16:07:49 I use oil in my diffuser. It definitely makes me feel calmmmm
5042 2018-10-16 16:07:36 Polenta and truffles, cheese fondue and truffles poured over passatelli, steak and truffles, roasted bread, olive oil and truffles . Btw white ones are the best
5043 2018-10-16 16:07:23 Well he was a hotel owner before that’s y and he can’t discriminate. Trump meant no financial interests while being POTUS. If anything , his interest is so the World can have access to oil!
5044 2018-10-16 16:07:21 I imagine this as an oil painting.
5045 2018-10-16 16:07:19 Blessed are the sheikhs, for they shall inherit the oil.
5046 2018-10-16 16:07:17 im bearish on health care since spiritual healing empty hospitals EXPENSIVE and cbd oil saves americans from skin cancer
5047 2018-10-16 16:07:17 I haven’t felt pressure like this in a long time. “Pay the cost”. Oil ain’t free..
5048 2018-10-16 16:07:16 He is giving them anointing oil
5049 2018-10-16 16:07:05 Read somewhere Russel 3000 started crashing, like our small caps. Then comes Russel 1000/2000 before Dow breaks eventually. As the interest rates increase, US stocks will follow. Only thing to be seen if UsD and Oil also cracks. If so, then any dumping would be temporary.

5053 2018-10-16 16:06:51 Not sure, i just use micellar water only. Tak pernah try lg cleansing oil 
5054 2018-10-16 16:06:49 @realDonaldTrump which is the responsibility of the Ministry of Duty and the Iranian Action Group to do this. Cutting off the Swift, like a full boycott of oil, is vital

5059 2018-10-16 16:06:23 Remember the macro trilogy-rates, dollar and oil-and make sure you keep that in your minds-esp if rates and oil rise, dollar drops-
5060 2018-10-16 16:06:19 Saudi Arabia says that if we put sanctions on them, for deathof journalist, they will increase their oil to $200/barrel. Let them! We have our OWN OIL, AND DONT NEED THEM! They were responsible for 9/11 anyway!

5064 2018-10-16 16:06:06 Many other nations are a 10th the size we are, don't have an illegal immigrant problem, & are taxed at 60% to pay for it OR use a Gov oil company to pay for it.
5065 2018-10-16 16:06:06 I assumed this to be solely the result of climate change, but the article indicates that land use is also to blame - the building of levees that prevent flooding vital for the maintenance of the delta, as well as dredging canals for oil and gas exploration.
5066 2018-10-16 16:06:03 Just bought olive oil from lidl. Love lidl and aldi
5067 2018-10-16 16:06:02 This is a very poor place to allow pickup and discharge of a very large number of students. If they all used school bus and a park&ride location, less money would be spent on fuel and time as well.
One reason why oil companies do not like energy efficient cities. Wants $$$ spent.
5068 2018-10-16 16:05:59 Terrence, everybody knows you are nothing more than a shill for that American hedge fund that owns the national post which seems to be nothing more than a public relations forum for big oil and american style capitalism.
5069 2018-10-16 16:05:52 wow this is so disappointing. i’ve been saving up for UFO oil. now i’ll be getting something else

5071 2018-10-16 16:05:43 One problem with this way of thinking. We push OPEC deeper into the pocket of Russia and sellout NATO at the same time giving away access to one of their oil supply lines tipping the balance of power further since ISSI entered the picture and Congress tied this President's hands
5072 2018-10-16 16:05:28 Yep, Ban all muslim countries except the once that give us oil.
5073 2018-10-16 16:05:11 Oil has to be watched let's see if trump punishes Saudis which I hardly doubt but sanctions on Iran should take Brent to 90+ and wti 80++ lol I would have to buy bicycle then or donkey cart 
5074 2018-10-16 16:05:01 65 FOR A OIL CHANGE!?!?
5075 2018-10-16 16:04:59 I remember back then in School when i was cooking concoction rice. I mistakenly pour kerosene in the rice, which i taught it's oil. And i was on lent (fasting). I couldn't withstand the hunger, so i have to wash d rice so that i can eat o. But the rice was still tasting kerosene

5079 2018-10-16 16:04:41 It’s time to get rid of oil switching to clean energy! To save our planet and to get rid of the Assassins who are actuyruling the world ! If they cannot sell their oil the Saudi are done

5087 2018-10-16 16:03:57 it is definitely possible. I got so annoyed with my own Shit Not Together ways that I now have my Shit in a Sort of Together Pile. I even scheduled an oil change in a timely fashion the other day, and am going to get my license renewed at an appropriate time.
5088 2018-10-16 16:03:52 Why isn’t #UKOG over 2p, @DavidLenigas can you start tweeting about 50 billion barrels of oil or something please.
5089 2018-10-16 16:03:29 i wasnt trying to insult or worry you. im stating facts to what ive seen and what you told me. free oil changes is still a privilege u have that others dont. be grateful. lmao

5092 2018-10-16 16:03:25 This weather is making me so dry I’m about to dip my whole body in coconut oil
5093 2018-10-16 16:03:23 The White Paper estimated $114/brl, based on a range of predicted prices, one of which was the UKGovt's own prediction of $124/brl. But oil is only 10% of Scots economy, unlike Noway where it is 30% and yet somehow they're one of the wealthiest nations per capita in the world...
5094 2018-10-16 16:03:22 Saudis will ship a tanker of oil to turkey and all will be forgiven.

5108 2018-10-16 16:02:25 What happened to our reserve oil that was apparently sold? I was under the impression that we bought in bulk and kept stock piles for times like these. Now we have to jump every time America and the oil giants farts. This happens when you sell your country.

5121 2018-10-16 16:01:25 Bitumen is not oil... yet. It costs more to transport, costs more to refine, has residual pollutants that are difficult to deal with and a higher sulphur content in the final product.  It is not oil and therefore will never be as valuable

Oil is still a leverage against global sanctions.

I run a small oil company in Lloydminster, here is who made what up to Sept 2018:

Govt of all forms - $307,876
Oil Company - treading water

The stupid thing is that the oil company is taking all of the risk...

SB21 gave away $2 Billion per year #akleg is still violating the state Constitution. With oil at $80, We should be putting billions in the bank, not just getting a small surplus.

5148 2018-10-16 15:58:58 This is just his snake oil salesman approach to not paying his bill.  He's a deadbeat.  Kudos to Warren for proving him to be the con man we know he is.
5149 2018-10-16 15:58:49 In other news great work done by @BMWFairfield yesterday but oil light comes on today when they ticked the box yesterday saying it was checked and fine, so a further unnecessary visit needed tomorrow morning for them to sort. As nice as I am it is getting a little frustrating!
5150 2018-10-16 15:58:43 What big business & corporation doesn't receive corporate welfare? Oil companies in Texas? LOL.
5151 2018-10-16 15:58:29 Wait untill people land on mars or Venus and find oil and gold then the *REAL* shit storm will start
5152 2018-10-16 15:58:26 There are plenty of professions that work 100 hour work weeks. As long as the employees are getting adequate compensation for the extra time (i.e. time off after development, extra pay, etc) there is no issue. How do you think oil field workers feel?
5153 2018-10-16 15:58:25 らあさんありがとうございますすごーーい！！

5162 2018-10-16 15:57:37 Being a mechanic really has me scared to be on the road with some of y’all Brakes down to metal on metal and all this lady is worried about is did I finish her oil change

5169 2018-10-16 15:57:04 Ethanol C2H5OH will replace Okl demand in future. Technically it can replace Oil but scientists must work with government to see how we can produce mass Ethanol.
5170 2018-10-16 15:57:03 No, rail service is always preferred by riders and voters although Shell oil came up with BRT to compete with rail. Keep trying.

5177 2018-10-16 15:56:42 Eaten pizza around the world, Italian pizza is the worst,sorry. It’s crust is often dry(hence tastes like a scab) it’s inside is flooded with oil and the basil is supposed to distract from that.
Good pizza has thick crust(on emoji) ham(prosciutto is tastety but hard to bite).
IMO
5178 2018-10-16 15:56:41 @altonbrown Question about the first episode? Is it assumed that you are heating up the cast iron while the steak is in the 200 degree oven, and it just goes from oven to hot skillet as fast as possible, or should it cool enough for you to oil it up?
5179 2018-10-16 15:56:34 Oil And Water .
5180 2018-10-16 15:56:28 I think this sounds good for Nigeria.
Now, the oil price is getting better even during this administration. I hope they can make good out of it(not bailouts this time) and stop blaming the past administration.
5181 2018-10-16 15:56:25 Oil and gas industry as well.
5182 2018-10-16 15:56:19 Now if this had been an oil platform...
5183 2018-10-16 15:56:04 In what world is this a good deal for Canada? Read : Lumber, tarriffs, steel tarriffs, aluminium tarrifs, higher drug prices, screwing dairy industry, and really no access to government contracts. U.S. already gets discount oil. What more could we give  them?
5184 2018-10-16 15:56:03 Just dropped my car off to get a oil change so it’s all ready for Vegas  #threeweeks

5187 2018-10-16 15:55:59 But does the oil separate or is it that shittolio with the palm oil added?
5188 2018-10-16 15:55:40 I got the UFO oil treatment both of the bottles because the reviews said it got rid of acne I had to save up for 4 months bc it was so expensive but I was so disappointed bc it didn’t work... at all this makes me so sad it was the most expensive skin care makeup I ever bought

5190 2018-10-16 15:55:38 Stop sending CIA agents in Latin America. Stop training the torturers of the south.We r sick of your accusations against the left down south. Venezuela have difficulty because YOU PUT SANCTIONS AGAINST the people and KIDS of the richest country in oil OF THE PLANET.Oil not yours
5191 2018-10-16 15:55:34 Happens to all of us at some point. I was bullish oil prices for $90 on Iran sanctions, Venezuela collapsing and strong demand growth. Now the global economy is going into a likely recession next year oil prices have dived like an Argentinian striker
5192 2018-10-16 15:55:17 O yes! Look at int'l oil prices and petroleum products prices in the region. And for electricity price hike, I'll suggest you to do some research on circular debt and capacity payments of power plants. ~30% dollar based ROE of power plants guaranteed by GoP.
5193 2018-10-16 15:55:08 You can buy capsules and put the amount of oil desired in those capsules and swallow. It almost fully hides the taste!
5194 2018-10-16 15:55:07 Have you sent same message to oil cartels who control majority of price? So much petroleum refined in this state yet means nothing to locals. Profit set by and for international oligarchs.

5209 2018-10-16 15:53:28 It's time for Western democracies to break ties with Saudi Arabia. Completely.

They make all that nice oil, you say? Well, presto, another argument for renewables.

They murder journalists with bone saws. They are NOT our friends. #SaudiArabia

5224 2018-10-16 15:52:10 The cbd/thc oil is legal here but there’s a list of illnesses. You have to meet one of those on the list to even get your med marijuana card from the health dept. then you have to find one of the few places that distributes low key. It’s not legal to produce it/sell it in GA.

5229 2018-10-16 15:51:40 To say nothing of the fact that we now havea far right leaning SCOTUS, science denier heading the EPA, a Secretary of the treasury who's costing us MILLIONS to fly first class, a Sect of the interior who's selling off land to oil companies, embassies understaffed, kids in cages..
5230 2018-10-16 15:51:37 Omg yes. It WAS energy law. Alhamdullilah! Yo the Arab in me thought I would be interested in oil and gas. What even ! Alhamdullilah
5231 2018-10-16 15:51:31 The oil is legal now, but I'm not aware of a place that gives any guidance about it. I'll look though - I hadn't thought of that. (My Drs have signs in their lobbies warning against it.)

5234 2018-10-16 15:51:16 This is super disappointing. Reviews are such a valuable tool when looking at products, & hearing that a company is potentially putting out fake ones is so disheartening. Let the product speak for itself. :/ sad because I love the UFO oil but can't support this if it's true. ):

5241 2018-10-16 15:50:53 The more you earn from oil the more subsidy you must pay. JEG paid subsidy ( less than PMB) and kept fuel at 86 Naira. Buhari is paying more subsidy even when Nigerians are paying N145 for fuel.If JEG was successful in pegging fuel at 145 his earnings would have made sense. Think

5247 2018-10-16 15:50:04 Moronic article as most countries in the g7 are not in the oil business. Another article based on half truths, how can you be so gullible?

5252 2018-10-16 15:49:43 Part of the difficulty is no experience with a counterfactual: since the discovery of oil, the region has been dominated by a Western Power (British, then American).

But has the US really been the great stabilizer? As Will Ferrell said: “Who has two thumbs and created ISIS.”
5253 2018-10-16 15:49:43 Crunch time isn't shit unless they arent being compensated for rest. 100+ hour weeks are habit in a LOT of jobs. Just because its dev work doesnt mean they get a pass. Oil field works just as hard and dont even get me started on ranching.
5254 2018-10-16 15:49:41 I'm trying to be an adult and took my car in for an oil change and tire rotation but the mechanic here keeps giving me creepy ass looks and I'm reminded why I never do this

5266 2018-10-16 15:47:37 Hence mostly the reason as why the primer is made with the foundation or often sold together. It’s just the science of it all. Very cool stuff! If I use a silicion based primer 9/10 a silicion based foundation will make it look better versus mixing an oil or anything

5275 2018-10-16 15:46:37 I can smell oil burning and I know it’s my head gasket leaking down the back of the engine.... does anyone have experience with this job? I know I can’t afford a shop to fix it and I’m not on paper yet at my new job so I can’t finance a new car at the moment either. #life

5279 2018-10-16 15:46:24 I think I need an oil change 
5280 2018-10-16 15:46:17 Seriously sampai 300 utk normal service??normal service biasanya around 100 lebih je sis,300-400 tu biasanya dah include radiator coolant,brake fluid,air filter semua bagai tukalau tukar engine oil dgn oil filter tak sampai 200

5282 2018-10-16 15:46:10 Check your Transmission oil this morning.
5283 2018-10-16 15:45:58 Apart from the obvious, my first thought was that maybe the Saudis don’t export as many goods and/or services to the West (apart from oil obviously and that might be practically difficult for people to organise a BDS movement around)
5284 2018-10-16 15:45:57 tell me why I’ve gotten my oil changed at the same place for two years and it’s only been $32 but this time it’s $65????
5285 2018-10-16 15:45:47 I'm glad you mentioned the use of mag in other chronic health conditions. I just started rubbing mag oil into my wrists and fingers where I have RA pain / swelling. It's a bit early to comment fully but I can tell you I notice a difference and I am very hopeful and optimistic!
5286 2018-10-16 15:45:45 Name calling is perfectly acceptable, and deservedly so. 

Why, you ask? Because the previous administrations who acted so dignified while robbing us blind created this atmosphere.

I’d rather have a foul mouth, and truth be told than a snake oil salesman giving me the run around
5287 2018-10-16 15:45:45 coba pake face oil nder

5289 2018-10-16 15:45:41 Had to. She’s been shaky as of late. Somebody just blowing her shit out. Gave her a nice oil change & serviced the account
5290 2018-10-16 15:45:23 Energy from electricity gets greener but oil based energy stays the same regardless; a wiser choice today & 2moro #electricvehicle #driveelectric
5291 2018-10-16 15:45:23 Time is ripe for the US to establish democracy in the Saudi.
Oil prices are rising too

5292 2018-10-16 15:45:08 I’d say Vitamins D but plenty sun  dey naija & you’re out & about anyways. I take Vitamins D, C, B, Folic acid & Cod liver oil. Since you’re not consistent with taking Centrum; I doubt you’ll be good at popping five different vitamins oh 
5293 2018-10-16 15:45:00 Cutting, punching or tearing down oil and gas devices to steal the oil and gas contained within should be defined as a crime of harming public security, China's top court said.
5294 2018-10-16 15:44:51 Shroud and ninjas personalities go together like oil and water. They're not meant to be a team really. You and shroud or you and vzns are my favorite teams.
5295 2018-10-16 15:44:45 Yeah...one major trend I'm seeing: put the onus for climate change on individual actions, instead of the massive corporations and oil barons. Yes, we can play our part individually, but our individual impact pales in comparison to those.
5296 2018-10-16 15:44:44 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed

5298 2018-10-16 15:44:25 That has more to do with us overthrowing any democratically elected leaders over there & installing dictators who will be obedient to our oil companies & banks.

5300 2018-10-16 15:44:07 It is time to world governing body to freeze SA private and public assets specially the US, and take full control of oil fields for the benefit of Saudi nation and rest of the world.
5301 2018-10-16 15:44:05 @realDonaldTrump  You are  A #shysty  A** snake oil salesman and you are not fit to be president  ! The media pundits keep saying we shouldn't play Donald Trump  Game. I say  The #Dems  Should do exactly that The Donald is a crybaby  A**  Punk @MSNBC
5302 2018-10-16 15:43:57 Is CBD oil legal now? Medical Marijuana just became legal in OK October 1, but the CBD places have been here a while.
5303 2018-10-16 15:43:55 Iyi irinani , cooking oil from $3 to $13

5305 2018-10-16 15:43:45 The Witcher:
It was a snowy day in Kaer Morhen. Vesemir was teaching new recruits about  White Wolfs. 'Use  Beast Oil against them', he said, 'It'll make your jobs easier'.
5306 2018-10-16 15:43:44 .@BarkingPoints 
BARKING POINT: the fuckers in the fossil fuel industry are forbidden from ever using anything based on oil ever again, including all plastics.
5307 2018-10-16 15:43:40 3 mini loaves of my own made up vegan bread! Using olive oil steeped in basil, chilli, garlic, sun dried tomato, and olives added to the dough for a bit of ‘bite’. Smells divine, i cannot wait to try it!
5308 2018-10-16 15:43:33 Yes I know. 

Another point, I can also assume he'll buy the crude mostly from Nigeria - NNPC. I don't know but they surely can bill in Naira based on the market crude oil price. i.e there are a lot of ways to reduce the fx risk.
5309 2018-10-16 15:43:27 Anybody wanna hang out with me in Walmart for 2 hours while I get my oil changed lol
5310 2018-10-16 15:43:26 Its just oil you drinking and eating. Build something else for your economy before its too late, oil is going to vanish soon boss. 
5311 2018-10-16 15:43:16 do the cooking oil companies own shops ??

@CdeNMaswerasei smtimes u jes talk for the sake of talking

5314 2018-10-16 15:43:05 Even when we send people into a war, we do our best to minimize any harm. Smoking pot is as bad as tobacco for your lungs.

Also, the oil in marijuana, CBD, which is starting to show promise as a treatment for anxiety and trauma disorders, is legal and is sold over the counter.
5315 2018-10-16 15:43:03 Uh, oh! Mustn’t upset MbS. Now expect a big oil price rise for that effrontery.
5316 2018-10-16 15:43:00 On #WorldFoodDay, I reiterate @INCTelangana’s promise of free ration for Dalit & Girijan BPL families which includes 6 kg fine rice per person,atta,palmolein cooking oil,toor dal,sugar,salt,turmeric & tamarind. We are committed to eliminating hunger & ensuring complete nutrition.

5319 2018-10-16 15:42:49 hmm witch hazel can irritate skin and sometimes make oily skin and acne worse. i would try mixing a few drops of the tto with something like jojoba oil
5320 2018-10-16 15:42:31 I once met a man who worked in the oil industry and swore blind that fracking was perfectly safe. I believed his sincerity. He said the data was unequivocal. I wondered where he got his data from.
5321 2018-10-16 15:42:31 As a Marine, I can honestly say that that I am embarrassed for my Corps every time I hear Oliver North opens his mouth to sell the snake oil that is the modern @NRA

China grew on US subsidies..thats over
5328 2018-10-16 15:42:02 Dab with tea tree oil when you first feel it.
5329 2018-10-16 15:41:58 Gas lighting much?  Logically, if tRumpf takes "liberties with the truth" kind of counteracts the claim "the most honest president in American history."  Oh, my bad.  Of course "logic" and MAGAts mix as well as oil and water.
5330 2018-10-16 15:41:58 By Democrat standards on justice the Turkish accusations are quite "believable" and we should nuke Saudi Arabia, confiscate all their wealth and oil, and give it to the Turks.  This is justice!

5334 2018-10-16 15:41:25 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
5335 2018-10-16 15:41:25 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
5336 2018-10-16 15:41:24 People are not buying less. Demand for oil is at an all time high.
5337 2018-10-16 15:41:18 Operators are the God's of the market. They give & they take.

For tomorrow, I believe the greenary will sustain & continue as..

Dow up, oil down.

To be of use, every chaotic system needs boundary conditions and an initial state to generate the "successful outcome" as laid out by the -

5347 2018-10-16 15:40:36 Are they getting paid overtime? If so and they know what they're getting into quit crying on other people's behalf. I work in the oil and gas industry and I know ppl that haven't been home in months. If you are happy with the pay or find it fulfilling do it, If not shut up.

5355 2018-10-16 15:40:06 confirmed: leading therapists confirm that once Mr. Drumpf tries to formulate a clear sentence, more than one earthling subscibes to the #NYT
5356 2018-10-16 15:40:03 Yeah, if it becomes reoccurring (hope not) and anxiety pills don't work. I recommend Dramamine motion sickness pills or this oil you put behind your ears called motion eaze. Really good for naseau

5360 2018-10-16 15:39:52 Warren's ancestral title was Chief Sitting Bull Cheekboner, a legendary snake oil sales merchant peddling lies that just rolled off her tongue. Major airhead but with insidious fanatical left wing socialist policies. Listen here Gringo, you are a fully fledged whitey! Get over it
5361 2018-10-16 15:39:43 @AJNewsGrid The Monarchy in Saudi Arabia, dictators in the Philippines, those in Washington DisEase, the few who place Gold, Oil and Drugs (G.O.D.) above the right for Freedom Of Speech, #DemandPressFreedom Here is the solution, "Greed" in Capitalism everywhere, must end!

5369 2018-10-16 15:39:08 No honestly we don't see everything and we use our kitchen a ton. Chipping does happen for sure but the oil spots etc. usually scrubbing it down w/hot water and soft scrub does the trick.
5370 2018-10-16 15:39:07 I’m looking forward to Kiefer’s new thoughts on MCT oil, as well as everything else!
5371 2018-10-16 15:39:06 Please don’t embarrass us by giving man of the match a bottle cooking oil
5372 2018-10-16 15:39:06 would never work man just keeps soaking oil & will never fry....Experimented with it as a kid

5376 2018-10-16 15:38:48 Leaving deisel and oil on the road for us to ride into.
5377 2018-10-16 15:38:43 Ultimately oil needs to get to that price. We need to move toward renewables. Polluting needs to become prohibitively expensive.
5378 2018-10-16 15:38:38 What do we learn from the #JamalKhashoggi case?

If you sell cheap oil to US Empire and buy tons of weapons with the money US Empire paid you they’ll look the other way when you murder a US resident and journalist.

If you’re Saudi Royalty murder isn’t a crime, it’s just a hobby.
5379 2018-10-16 15:38:27 For soup, cook diced shallots in oil, then simmer with eggs, green curry paste, beef broth and asparagus. Top with orzo.
5380 2018-10-16 15:38:24 One Thing Has Become Quite Clear In The Disappearance of #JamalKhashoggi : Jamal Was A Very Powerful Man, as His Death Is Affecting US Relations w / Saudi Arabia, Potentially The Price of Oil, The War in Yemen, The Middle Eastern Balance of Power Between Iran / Saudi..
5381 2018-10-16 15:38:22 I just came here for an oil change & now its 2.5hrs later, U wanna charge me to fix shit that isn't even wrong in my car, and I'm grumpy cause I haven't eaten and it's going on noon. Ugh.
5382 2018-10-16 15:38:16 I got 255,000 miles out of a manual gearbox on a Citroen XM over seven years. If you change the oil and drive long distances (something you can't do in a Tesla easily), you should be good for double that. I only ever had one new clutch plate fitted to that car.

5384 2018-10-16 15:38:12 Thank you so much for your comment! The fat from coconut oil vs canola oil is digested very differently. And same with processed white flour vs. almond flour. Feel free to send us an email (info@emmysorganics.com) for more information! 
5385 2018-10-16 15:38:12 well shit

i guess that means the hash browns are the same since theyre fried in the same oil?

5387 2018-10-16 15:38:11 I understand and agree this is a heartless and despicable act and completely unacceptable. My problem is with the sanctions the dems are crying for...do you really believe Americans are going to be thinking this is great when jobs are loss and oil and gas go through the roof?

5391 2018-10-16 15:37:56 Lets not forget gas and oil prices are going up as the winter months are starting to come in. Wages are at an all time low, families are losing their health care. Drug prices are rising..so about this winning ??

5393 2018-10-16 15:37:48 I highly recommend that all the participants in the Global Coalition be displaced from their countries. It is not bad. Try it. You are in Deir Ezzor sucking oil and gas and controlling water. What can it be worse??
5394 2018-10-16 15:37:39 Do you have any coconut oil in the house?
5395 2018-10-16 15:37:33 Qué cinismo.
5396 2018-10-16 15:37:32 People of this country will be happy if central and state government freeze further increase of taxes on petrol and reduce expenditure of oil companies atleast cocktail in dinner and reduce expenditure of officials on tour
5397 2018-10-16 15:37:29 Call it what it is...GENOCIDE. Call out those doing it. British govt and their jihadists to steal oil and gas from Hebrew Biafra and same by French govt on Southern Cameroon.
5398 2018-10-16 15:37:21 I’ve learned that I’m ok with the occasional chipping- I expected it! I’m not ok with it looking dirty apparently (it’s making me crazy). Without wax/oil don’t you see every fingerprint/water drip/oil mark?

5401 2018-10-16 15:37:12 I see what you did there Peter. 1987 but most cows don’t produce milk because oil prices are unpredictable in this current climate.
5402 2018-10-16 15:37:06 Oh like the oil spots etc.? No the soft scrub usually takes care of that - and yes I would bother me I get it! And it would make my husband crazy. And we have similar color - nice taste :)!

5406 2018-10-16 15:36:41 Wake up and smell the coffee! Donald Trump has misused his position & power to do favors for his Donors that have bought & paid the Republicans. The Donors-Adelsons, Mercers, Koch's, NRA & oil companies really run this country. Trump reeks of corruption. Vote this party out!
5407 2018-10-16 15:36:38 Solar, renewables and wind? Yes I’m totally for those innovative future looking energies. Coal and oil? No
5408 2018-10-16 15:36:38 In 2001, Microsoft faced a slew of antitrust cases against it by the FTC and lost. Unlike Standard Oil in 1911, which broke up, Microsoft lived to thrive, and how.

So, when Rohit Chopra & Lina Khan team up to eventually take on Amazon, will it go the MS or the Standard Oil way?
5409 2018-10-16 15:36:31 Shame of KSA for invading a poor country for its vested  interests i.e. Oil. What about Qatar? People of Hijaz deserve better rulers than Al e Saud. We love our brothers. But we cannot defend Al e Saud and their evil designs. Soon they will face the music.

5428 2018-10-16 15:34:48 Well, Mr. Ahmadinejad, could you tell people where the over $700 Billion you government made in oil and gas went? This was during your tenure as president. 

BTW, why don't you publish what you know? Remember all the  بگم، بگم..

5434 2018-10-16 15:34:36 Hmmm....what type of thinking is this, always focusing on oil. Oil price spikes never last. The key thing to do is to diversify government revenue away from oil.
5435 2018-10-16 15:34:25 We don't do either with ours - mineral oil gives it that sheen that people like but then you're committed to that. I do hot water with a small amount of soft scrub w/bleach when I clean them. Be careful w/softscrub though - bleach in it can leave spots.

5467 2018-10-16 15:31:09 Yep.  I spend a lot of time wondering why every single NHL team the Oil play is always in the right place but the Oilers are constantly chasing. Is it systems (easily beaten or countered system) or personnel (not smart enough to play within the system/adapt to it)

2)  If hoarding is a "3rd world idea" why would the US ever consider exporting US oil for USD's we can (allegedly) print ad infinitum?
5470 2018-10-16 15:30:52 add OIL
5471 2018-10-16 15:30:50 has anyone considered that maybe the government and "climate change deniers" don't actually disbelieve the evidence, but have realized there is nothing we can do to stop climate change so they might as well profit and hoard wealth from oil and gas now?
5472 2018-10-16 15:30:43 But you know some media will take it as a "huge supercharger which can displace all of HK big oil with only 50 individual charging stalls"

5493 2018-10-16 15:29:19 So let me get this right. Calgary downtown still has a huge vacancy rate, good paying jobs especially oil jobs are leaving. Govt is hiring and part time is up. Your answer is to tax and reg. Business more all of which results in more expensive goods and services.

5539 2018-10-16 15:25:04 You think our shortcomings are a lack of brainpower? That's like saying people are starving because we can't produce enough food. Both assumptions are false.
I get you wanna be in with the pro-women crowd, all woke and stuff. But you can do better.

5546 2018-10-16 15:24:42 An oil embargo can have only a minimal effect, as the US imports less than 10% of its requirements from SA. Canada is the main supplier of oil to the US. However, a drastic cut in the oil production, unless compensated by other OPEC members, can lead to dramatic increase in oil

5551 2018-10-16 15:24:23 Scratch a little below the surface... We don't have the huge reserves of natural gas, oil, and what's more important, hydro-power the Norwegians have access to, meaning they can sell much more local energy than they use.

5555 2018-10-16 15:24:12 KWH costs vary of course, but mine is also lower than $0.20/kwh, at $0.13/kwh.  $9.75 for 310 miles of range!  Compare to over $30 for a 'fill-up', and add oil changes, and a lot more maintenance.  Really adds up, so still works easily at $0.2/kwh, which some areas have.

5563 2018-10-16 15:23:31 You mean that you don't want your buddies in the oil lobby to have to be driven out of business by smarter, cleaner and better technology.  Whale oil merchants were upset too when the end came.  That's what free market capitalism is about.

5565 2018-10-16 15:23:21 Just a note to those arguing that we should stop importing Saudi oil. The issue isn't OUR need for it. The US has alternative fossil fuel sources including shale oil. If you want to promote environmental harm in the US and Canada, just keep arguing that. The EU needs Saudi oil.
5566 2018-10-16 15:23:02 I have a gallon of canola oil.  Y'all get them taters thin sliced and we can have a nice mess of chips.  Want vinegar and salt on 'em, or do you prefer a sprinkle of BBQ rub seasoning?

5584 2018-10-16 15:22:04 Random thought: 
Benefits of MCTs oil is that it bypass many of the normal mechanisms for fatty acid absorption. Most fats can take up to 3 hours before they’ll cause any kind of surge in available free fatty acids (FFA) for energy, but MCTs can pass into your system directly.

5586 2018-10-16 15:22:00 I BELIEVE THE ATTACK ON ALBERTA OIL IS BASED ON THE FEAR OF WESTERN POWER AND INFLUENCE IN CANADA.
5587 2018-10-16 15:21:56 Sir, we have to think about alternative fuel. 
US has got oil reserves for 200 years! 
So they will not allow for other fuels! 
On the other hand, their scientists visited our GKVK for biofuel especially Pongamia two years back! And now they have established plantations too.
5588 2018-10-16 15:21:50 with each step, you get more modern and wealthier city environments. you know, like a Russian doll :)

5609 2018-10-16 15:20:26 Bahraini MP Jasim Husain: Bahrain's new flexible work visa helps expats 'become their own bosses,' helps diversify the economy as the region moves away from oil.

5610 2018-10-16 15:20:25 @SenatorHeitkamp Build a pilot plant, create jobs, clean up the environment and make your own fuel locally regardless of external market pressures.

5655 2018-10-16 15:16:37 A massive, post chapt 11/7 consolidation is about to hit the patch. But, this will need 2 key catalysts - 1. high interest rates, that will increase debt service costs, and lower OPM optionality.  2. High enough oil prices to make taking on cut rate debt worthwhile, for EUR.

5660 2018-10-16 15:16:10 Info is online, but all you need is a jar of unrefined coconut oil & about an oz of bud (trim is okay, but bud has more THC as more trichomes). Decarboxylate herb in oven @ low temp, then cook slowly in double boiler for hrs & keep stirring. Strain, and oil will set at room temp.
5661 2018-10-16 15:16:04 Tough problem here Mr. President
Thank God that you got our production up enough to be a leader in the world. We don't need them. If we still have our strategic reserve, we could easily use that to keep oil prices down. Give the Jets to Israel

2-Conflicts of Interest=SA IS financially vested in Trump real estate/loans
3-US isn't as dependent on oil as in past

5671 2018-10-16 15:15:27 FWIW, crude oil futures look overbought, and there should be a substantial price correction that could last a year or longer.

5677 2018-10-16 15:15:01 Whether the CCC said it was infeasible or not in the past is perhaps beside the point. The point now is that it is most definitely feasible using PV and wind that produce energy at less than the cost of oil and large scale #Vanadium #Energstorage to balance the grid.
5678 2018-10-16 15:14:53 Mr Trump & MBS (Moe Bull Shit) have settled on a Lie
Rogue Ninja Commandos, @RNC accidentally questioned Kashoggi 2 death

Sounds plausable, but
Send Gulf Oil Pompeo, @GOP 2 cover up with #MBS, More Black Smoke

5681 2018-10-16 15:14:48 3) US will loose its refinancing capacity, as (i) fiscal deficit exploded (ii) largest US debt holders stopped buying treasuries (Ch and Jp) (iii) Yuan is on ints path to become a reserve currency (7% of 14 trillion oil transactions in the world are already dominated in yuan).
5682 2018-10-16 15:14:47 You should also ask yourself why Nig witnessed recession
Ask Niger Delta Avengers that punished Nig in 2015-16 despite oil price was abysmally low. About 28 States cannot pay salaries or pensions. Abandoned projects scattered all over the country

Hypocrisy & conspiracy theory
5683 2018-10-16 15:14:39 Liar tRump thumbs nose at murder in favor of financial gain. Today the story cools. Guns! Oil! Money! Poser! Trump and pals are literally killing the Free Press! #TrumpLiesEverytimeHeSpeaks #RESIST #FreePress

5686 2018-10-16 15:14:15 Waiting for an oil change that’s taking way too long, I’ll reiterate that First Take is an insufferable piece of television trash.
They seriously give the cesspool that is syndicated daytime TV a challenge for the worst.
ESPN should aim for far better.
5687 2018-10-16 15:14:12 Traitor trudeau placed a tanker moratorium on the west coast, but doesn't do the same on the east coast....is he just friendly to OPEC oil or is he just anti-Alberta? @jkenney @SMandel_AB @OilGasCanada @aboutpipelines @oilrespect @UACanada @PipelineAction #NEP2 #Alberta #abpoli

5695 2018-10-16 15:13:38 More importantly, let the market figure out how to put financial value on climate risk.  Then the companies best positioned to invest (ie oil and CIIs) have a reason to grow their way out.
5696 2018-10-16 15:13:34 Sounds more like you speak for the homophobic fans.

5698 2018-10-16 15:13:32 Kids, the lesson we learn today is that you should never think about the charlynch feud while handling boiling oil. Accidents might happen and you might get burned.
5699 2018-10-16 15:13:30 India consumes 20% of oil production of world. We have no strategic control over oil production. USA has good control.

5703 2018-10-16 15:13:17 @JeepCares what a joke!  Dealership ripping off a customer for an oil service that wasn’t necessary, charging for a courtesy car, charging for mileage on said courtesy car and then telling them to drive a car away with a faulty turbo!! Shame on you and your dealerships
5704 2018-10-16 15:13:16 BTW, Indonesia per cap income is amongst highest in SE Asia, is at or higher than 8 East Euro countries, has almost as much standard oil reserves as Canada, is the most populous Islamic country where LGBTQ+, women, and infidels are persecuted...just sayin' #cdnpoli @TheRebelTV

5708 2018-10-16 15:12:47 US foreign policy has effectively given them the hobbling of their enemy, more market control, and higher return on their oil.  At what cost?  Buying some arms from the US arms industry, a lobby that has bought and paid for the GOP.  The real burden is being carried by consumers.
5709 2018-10-16 15:12:45 sadly they contain beef flavoring, though i can’t confirm if it’s in the oil they fry them in or the powder they use to season them, or even both, but the fries contain beef byproduct

5713 2018-10-16 15:12:38 We are continuing to use all available tools, including those provided by the state of Florida, to assess chemical and oil facilities and NPL sites potentially impacted by Hurricane #Michael. Our teams will move into areas that are difficult to access once it is safe to do so.
5714 2018-10-16 15:12:21 Alas it's the arms sales that are at issue not the oil. We have a war in #Yemen to sustain at a handsome profit...

5720 2018-10-16 15:11:48 I hate hearing pols of both parties talking about us changing the Saudi or any other regime, regardless of oil, plane sales, area political considerations.  Haven't we learned from Qaddafi, Sadaam, and our interference in Syria?
5721 2018-10-16 15:11:27 @NestleUKI take leaf out of @IcelandFoods book.  Your palm oil pledges are not good enough.  Cut it out or you'll never have my custom again.
5722 2018-10-16 15:11:12 you have rulers not leaders when all the Authorities can do is be reactive and address symptoms and not root causes..

5727 2018-10-16 15:10:46 Funny how you righties care so much about Native American ancestry and culture when someone isn't Native enough for your needs but at the same time support a president who is torturing Natives and taking their land to run oil pipes through and leak oil into their drinking water.

5730 2018-10-16 15:10:12 The US had no right to enter Iraq and Afghanistan. It was for oil and money and had nothing to do with human rights. But that also doesn’t mean what Saudi is doing is right either. What is the saying 2 wrongs don’t make a right.

Iran is only the enemy because Saudi Arabia deems it so. 
The reason we bailed on the Iran Deal so Europe would have to buy oil from Saudi Arabia. 
How can you stand with such a vile and malicious group?

5735 2018-10-16 15:09:44 People are saying IF Saudi Arabia IS responsible for the death of the WAPO columnist that SA should face stiff sanctions. Um, SA is a extremely wealthy country...has their own oil...if we cut em off, they will buy elsewhere Remember, Russia builds Arms too! What is the solution?
5736 2018-10-16 15:09:42 Ugh dont even get me started on chicken. I know ppl deep fry those bitches but i always get burnt with the fucking oil. YESS THANK YOU then after the party we rally on with our comrades

5741 2018-10-16 15:09:15 To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it
5742 2018-10-16 15:09:15 Check Shell oil. Whom owns shell. Shell is also invested in Dakota pipeline.
5743 2018-10-16 15:09:14 I wish we didn't need them but by the looks of our administrations for decades doing nothing, it appears we do and our dollar is backed by their oil. 

I'm surprised this is even being covered by main stream media tbh.
5744 2018-10-16 15:09:13 Currently nuclear fission power is one of the cleanest forms of energy available. Nuclear fusion offers the potential for even cleaner and safer power production, but still requires a lot of research. I think future generations will see coal and oil as far more barbaric.
5745 2018-10-16 15:08:57 Bets on whether @realDonaldTrump will talk about too-high #oil prices when he comes to htown?

5747 2018-10-16 15:08:51 Maybe it has to do with their opposition to oil and gas pipelines crossing their lands?
5748 2018-10-16 15:08:51 The Saudi-U.S. diplomatic clash over the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi is stirring memories of the most traumatic event in the history of oil.
5749 2018-10-16 15:08:51 Just dropped the #wranglerjl off at the dealership for an oil change. ‘Felix is doing the oil changes wrong’. That’s reassuring @JeepCares
5750 2018-10-16 15:08:49 Doubt this is true. It would remove congressional seats that are reliable red. They might support it since it we make the US more green (less domestic oil). Certainly gets rid of some guns. What’s not to like?

We will see if oil money will talk.
5754 2018-10-16 15:08:11 All because of the western dependence on oil. Oil producing countries are behaving like the sadistic medieval organisations they are. They have no interest in human development apart from purchasing arms and developing their fake military might. Worried about a journalist? Why?

5757 2018-10-16 15:07:56 Aggressive promotion of Big Oil is not compatible with serious climate action. Yes, you desperately want to make this a point of differentiation with Tories but we’re not buying it.
5758 2018-10-16 15:07:56 What about the "rogue" perpetrators ? 
What about "oil war" threat by MbS to the west ?
5759 2018-10-16 15:07:54 Can they investigate why CNN has ad contacts with oil and fracking companies and then refuses to cover climate change? Or their defense ad contracts and how they refuse to cover US brutality and colonialism? Oh wait, I guess that about covers it.

5776 2018-10-16 15:06:18 On this day in 1973, OPEC announced an immediate hike in the price of crude oil to $5.12 a barrel, “to exercise their sovereign right to determine the price of their natural resources.” 

Brent crude, the global benchmark for oil prices, closed at $80.78 a barrel Monday.

Oil up $10 a barrel, wage growth up 2.7%, but inflation up 2.9%. 

Deficit % of GNP (tax cuts for rich) up to 4.2% from 3.4%.

5810 2018-10-16 15:03:55 D-4-kSA would supply Turkey with oil for 20 years, $35/barrel. 5-kSA would pay one trillion dollars compensation for 9/11.
5811 2018-10-16 15:03:51 ???????
5812 2018-10-16 15:03:47  WHY would they allow this?  Was it a blackmail-type situation to prevent further attacks?  Oil money repercussions?  What could have been the reason for such a travesty?
5813 2018-10-16 15:03:44 I forgot to bring lotion today so I’m just rubbing olive oil from the salad bar on my hands. I hate me
5814 2018-10-16 15:03:44 Ugh, getting my oil changed and the TV is on “The View” ...............
5815 2018-10-16 15:03:43 literally i only use coconut oil and their jamaican black castor oil leave in. it. works miracles 
5816 2018-10-16 15:03:33 When you take your car to get an oil change and they do more to your car than you asked for :)
5817 2018-10-16 15:03:30 
5818 2018-10-16 15:03:29 Oh and since you're answering half the question, how about the other half? Baggage Fees were implemented by @AmericanAir in 2008 when oil was $150/barrel. It is now MUCH MUCH lower and baggage fees doubled from 15 to $30. What gives?
5819 2018-10-16 15:03:28 Dogs, what's the point of them and I need some oil, 5w30 will do.

5821 2018-10-16 15:03:20 Fight that could rewrite oil and gas regulation in Colorado heads to state Supreme Court
5822 2018-10-16 15:03:16 It’s smells like fucking oil on this train it’s actually making me ill
5823 2018-10-16 15:03:11 Oil burning is still a thing? FIA has taken another steps to stop teams from doing that. Auxiliary oil tank must be empty in qualification since next year, and only one auxiliary oil tank with regulated flow and max. 2.5l of oil will be allowed since 2020. #F1
5824 2018-10-16 15:03:02 Im not conservative and cannabis was made illegal under false pretenses 10o years,ago so anyone whos dumb enough to support any laws on a plant that was used 10s of thousands of years before racist and tree farmers and oil companies fought to make cannabis illegal

5826 2018-10-16 15:02:57 Merci à Hollande pour la TIPP flottante qui amortissait la hausse du baril macron lui en rajoute chaque année il nous colle 1 taxe plein de gaz oil à quantité égale 350€ de plus qu' en 2017 macron vide notre porte monnaie
5827 2018-10-16 15:02:46 Does he not know how monarchies work? Or is he talking about overthrowing Salman and installing a democracy? Because that worked out so well in Iraq.

Just stop buying oil of them. Green energy, not only is it better for the environment, but you won't need to worry about oil.
5828 2018-10-16 15:02:39 AIUI, Solo Oil have been selling off to fund commitments elsewhere, so it is understandable that patterns will take longer to develop. We recently had a TR1 of under 3% holding, so they are on the way out.

Good research and nice graph mate :)
5829 2018-10-16 15:02:31 Most of them have heavy investments in oil, and the Saudis -- one entire family -- own enough to have their own country. That's power. The conservatives are power groupies, and they'll bend over for anyone who has enough of it.
5830 2018-10-16 15:02:16 Ambassador Anne Patterson: only 8% of oil imports come from Saudi Arabia. Although the US is becoming more energy-independent, Gulf energy exports feed America's closest allies in Europe and Asia--particularly South Korea and Japan.

5832 2018-10-16 15:02:08 Respected mam, Re is above 73, Stocks have never continued in one direction for a long time, NEVER, oil prices are close to 90 Rs. 
And this astrologer predicted Re to be 64 in Oct & always predict fall in fuel prices in india before election.
Salute to logic.
5833 2018-10-16 15:02:06 Mercenaries

who kill people w/ drones having 2% accuracy
are disgusting.

5835 2018-10-16 15:02:05 The best way to eat turmeric is in food with coconut oil & fresh ground black pepper or to use the recipe for golden paste developed by Doug English.

....With some olive oil and light garlic power it’s quite nice 
5837 2018-10-16 15:02:00 Selama ini di rumah ga pernah ngeh soal olive oil. Banyak olive oil, ya di lemari, di meja ruang tengah, di dapur. Dari botol kecil sampe botol segede lengan ada. Coba merhatiin dari kapan, ini muka udah jd glowing mulus kali :(

5843 2018-10-16 15:01:38 How much of our oil comes from Saudi though?
5844 2018-10-16 15:01:37 Human rights? You should look back on American history... And whilst doing that, name one invasion that was justified and was not just about resources and oil... Hypocrite...!

5846 2018-10-16 15:01:32 We no more give up our sovereignty to oil than we do the auto sector and yet nothing is ever said about the subsidies and gov support that sector gets.
5847 2018-10-16 15:01:25 Today I watched a customer spend five minutes in front of the donut case trying to pick two donuts based of calories. It's a giant carb, fried in an unhealthy oil then liberally slathered in sugar... if you're going to eat a donut, then eat the one you're craving.
5848 2018-10-16 15:01:23 “So we let each other get away with murder because you all love oil and we have Prince Kushner in our pockets with the President’s investments here. So let’s move on to something else.”

5850 2018-10-16 15:01:08 That's the fastest way to tank our economy and the dollar. It's the world's emergency currency and gold, oil, etc. are bought with the dollar.
5851 2018-10-16 15:01:05 Come on, man! You'd have to be in a bubble of cultural ignorance to take what the #GOP says on tax cuts seriously.

They've been peddling the same snake oil forever.

Same prediction, same outcomes.

Appreciate effort, but you're giving them way too much credit for  stupidity.
5852 2018-10-16 15:00:52 The things people say for attention is crazy. Yes most shops are not empty as in the not a sweet left. People are saying they empty becasue most basic commodities are not there eg cooking oil, sugar, flour chero water chaiyo. Get a life

5862 2018-10-16 14:58:55 Money is not the point the point is what either will do for us O'rourke will drag us back into high taxation

 As in is proposed $10 a barrel tax on oil

That tax will increase the cost of everything in your life

When have you ever heard a Democrat say cut taxes?
5863 2018-10-16 14:58:49 Try an organic cocoa butter and jojoba oil mixture 
5864 2018-10-16 14:58:47 I’m currently engaged in a project that requires solar energy.  It’s a nightmare.  Power density is just so low.
5865 2018-10-16 14:58:45 It belongs to those with the most industrial army, especially the first empire to have industrial power, which was boosted by slavery.
We've spent trillions, and wasted millions of lives to retain control of Oil.
2 World Wars, for a start.
The 1st action of WW1 was in Iraq.
5866 2018-10-16 14:58:43 Are front loaders and side loaders the same thing? Cause I'm googling and cant find anything pointing me to one... except for a huge industrial machine that resembles a homemade bbq made out of an oil drum.

5876 2018-10-16 14:57:29 Hi @Fidelity, how come your new sustainable mutual fund has at least 5 oil/petroleum companies and refineries in the holdings?
5877 2018-10-16 14:57:28 Division is when people are promised jobs in town and are motivated at a rally to abandon their fields and live on a promise of bags of cash from america, instead of being motivated to work on the fields and produce soybean for cooking oil and wheat for bread!
5878 2018-10-16 14:57:22 The Saudis have a powerful tool in their ability to raise oil prices but are loathe to use it. And they could not easily switch to China or Russia for defense.

5881 2018-10-16 14:57:05 Mentioned by Sendall in 'ITV in Britain', along with Ulster's 'Midnight Oil' and ABCs tentative plans for 'University of the Screen'. None progressed any further than tests as the Post Office in the early 60s was decidedly ill-disposed towards these concepts.
5882 2018-10-16 14:57:05 I am way past due for oil change, tire rotations and a multi-point inspection. 

appointment set for Friday. I love to take care of "True"
5883 2018-10-16 14:57:03 Upside correction in equities and falling USD has helped to move oil prices off of their earlier session lows. @DTNOilandGas @DtnTrading

5890 2018-10-16 14:56:34 If you really believe in this, then you would stop using oil and gas products, which include plastics and synthetic clothes. It's like someone warning of lead in the water while chugging gallons of it.

5897 2018-10-16 14:56:10 Demolition rules. Once in a demolition house we found an oil cistern that was filled with gasoline so basically the biggest pipebomb in the world.

Luckily we smelled it before putting the saw to work but like who stores gasoline in their basement like that?

5901 2018-10-16 14:55:39 Dr. Hayhoe, We know the science is solid. So, when are we going to sue, boycott or reject the oil companies who have been responsible for ruining the planet? We can flail all we want but we need to make them feel some pain. Otherwise they are not going to change their evil ways!
5902 2018-10-16 14:55:38 I'd say the tories are thick or just morons. But of course they are just doing the bidding of their funders in the petrol/oil industry. They don't give a fuck about the planet or our children as long as they get rich. Tory scum!

5910 2018-10-16 14:54:39 YB, since there are thousands hectar of palm oil plantation, why not put in some funds in research project to find out the technique of using the fibre of palm oil tree trunk to make paper, this will reduce further the chopping of trees in forest.
5911 2018-10-16 14:54:35 yes, it looks amazing, and also the native photoshop for Ipad, those oil and watercolor brushes look very real, and all designed for the new iPad, which is going to be a beast

In politics it’s never about justice and equity.

5924 2018-10-16 14:53:41 Actually, the whole US has financial interests in Saudi Arabia. Numerous companies sell into their markets and we still import some oil from that direction.

The Saudi's always threaten with high oil prices. Governments back off! Remember oil is priced in US Dollar.
5928 2018-10-16 14:53:13 We are producing our OWN oil & no longer need them

5945 2018-10-16 14:51:40 Saudi Arabia has been a disaster for decades, finally people are talking about this. We can make Saudi Arabia advance hundreds of years on human rights by telling them we won’t take their oil unless they stop what they’re doing. We made Saudi Arabia filthy rich, we have the power
5946 2018-10-16 14:51:33 Why ! Saudi Arabia things they do only have an Oil & Gold -Africa has Oil & Gold too . Saudi Arabia don't respect third World Muslim . Saudi Arabia's Royal family brings women made & Sexsually abuse them ! What a great Muslim .

5949 2018-10-16 14:51:28 Those 'puny' numbers put your earlier comments regarding the 1970s & making the oil market "big enough" into perspective. If the market for that shiny metal were MUCH larger...
5950 2018-10-16 14:51:19 Soooo Saudi Arabia can murder and dismember and American national but Turkey cant imprison one? The difference? Oil, weapons and a huge blackmail opportunity over the heads of the Trump cartel.

5973 2018-10-16 14:49:40 I am really uneasy watching us bow before Saudi royalty when we know what they did. I realize it’s complex, but looking the other way because of oil for 70 years brought us here.

5984 2018-10-16 14:48:58 He’s there to make sure the oil keeps flowing to the USA
5985 2018-10-16 14:48:55 Nah, I oil it regularly. You can see the residue in the coffee...
5986 2018-10-16 14:48:49 U.S. oil production has increased steadily over last 5 years,reaching a record high of 11.2M bpd in the week to 10/5. But infrastructure has not kept pace with rising output,filling domestic tanks to an extra 1.1 million barrels.

5991 2018-10-16 14:48:31 With developing countries reducing dependence on petroleum (increasing their use of renewable energy and leveraging natural gas) the Middle East is slowing losing customers.

The Middle East needs to find other means to make money and feed its populations (you can’t eat oil)

5996 2018-10-16 14:47:55 I want the following:
1. The US sanction Saudi Arabia fro making Kashoggi disappear
2. Saudi get angry and cut their oil production
3. Oil prices skyrocket, to like $300/barrel
4. Naija mind's its business and just lick stew in peace.

6008 2018-10-16 14:47:01 You are right about that. The large reason is because the major oil companies made a bunch of predictive technological patents, that were actually pretty good forward thinking. So a lot of the tech can't be patented because they own it.
6009 2018-10-16 14:46:46 Nope, because Democrats are pro-murder for oil.

6059 2018-10-16 14:42:07 Not with that much oil and that much money. The Sauds have been playing this game with us for decades. Asad used to play the same one where he would be pretty upfront about how terrible he was, but make clear that without him religious extremists would take over.

6075 2018-10-16 14:40:54 You mean like when '80s called for their foreign policy back? :) It's a great piece, but would (humbly) say we can't underestimate psychology & mid-term spikes referred to by Prof. Colgan--especially because of how oil & products are traded (globally, among allies, in dollars).
6076 2018-10-16 14:40:48 What else if not oil and petrochemicals? Are there who use crude oil as it is these days? 
6077 2018-10-16 14:40:46 I was under the impression the US is not importing oil from SA anymore due to domestic production and Canada imports.
6078 2018-10-16 14:40:45 America has invaded multiple nations to steal oil! America has; destabilized nations, assassinated heads of state, caused Civil Wars, as well as the refugee crisis & murdered civilians! America is a criminal enterprise! #SaudiArabia #Libya #Iran #Iraq #Venezuela #OPEC #Nigeria
6079 2018-10-16 14:40:36 I work 70-80 hrs a week every week and I’m in oil and gas. It sucks but that’s the way it is sometimes.

6081 2018-10-16 14:40:23 RSPO is a con perpetrated by the palm oil industry to put a gloss on their filthy business and try to make people think they actually give a damn about the damage they are inflicting on ecosystems in Indonesia and other countries blighted by palm oil plantations.
6082 2018-10-16 14:40:21 I would check it. We went and had our oil changed at a place and before our next service was due our engine blew for driving it without oil. They forgot to put the plug back in and we had driven it without oil.

6089 2018-10-16 14:40:04 Sure. I have been using CBD oil for a while and plan to use THC legally for various purposes. But if there is one thing Buddhism (and its American spinoff, "mindfulness") is about, it's engaging with the real world. So, intoxication is forbidden for clergy/discouraged for laypppl

c)  b/c they only report he said/she said

6094 2018-10-16 14:39:39 The day before I travel is always a little hectic.  Getting new tires and an oil change, doing laundry, and getting the bulletin ready.  Mass at the nursing home in Tyndall this afternoon, then heading to Omaha.

6099 2018-10-16 14:39:04 2. They eventually came to an agreement that centered around U.S. support  and military training for Saudi Arabia, then a fledgling country  surrounded by stronger nations, in return for oil and political support  in the region.
6100 2018-10-16 14:39:02 No oil...
6101 2018-10-16 14:39:01 Sir- please focus on falling rupees, sky rocketing oil prices and improving employment.  At least retain the existing industries not to move out of India.
6102 2018-10-16 14:38:54 "Many oil and gas fields, as in Pennsylvania [...] have already failed, yet vast amounts of gas continue to be poured into the air [...]. Cases are known in which great volumes of oil were systematically burned in order to get rid of it." G. Pinchot, 1910, 7-8. #history
6103 2018-10-16 14:38:31 point to  me where Corbyn Has recanted his support for Venezuela and condemned the economic mismanagement in Venezuela; the mistakes in nationalising oil, transportation, telecoms, agri businesses?   Or at least where he has expressed sorrow for the children dying ?
6104 2018-10-16 14:38:27 Snake oil wasn't enough?
He went full carnal cocktail. 
And his congregation - there's always at least the smallest element of personal responsibility.

ALL are wrong; all adopted an 'ignorance' attitude to human rights.

Oil, arm sales, & fighting in Iran are some causes - US needs 2 stop this negligent attitude now.

1. Tony Blair stopped BAE corruption enquiry.
2. Our politicians & diplomats are bending over backwards, like circus contortionists, to help MBS claim deniability.

a) Trash the dollar
b)Buy weapons from Russia
c)Oil

6124 2018-10-16 14:36:44 Right?  Ignore globalism at your own peril.  Even DOMESTIC oil will be sold overseas if the price is higher.
6125 2018-10-16 14:36:40 You forgot Oil. This is about The US and Oil interests in Venezuela.
6126 2018-10-16 14:36:32 Hey Mrs May. You don't have a coherent plan do you?
Everything is fix and mend.

6183 2018-10-16 14:31:58 Cannabis was made illegal in America so that Dupont would make more money off of oil and plastic patents.

While I'm not an expert regarding this, it's my understanding that when the U.S. went off the gold standard with president Nixon, he promised the Saudi's U.S. backing as long as they would only accept U.S. Dollars for their oil. In turn the arms deals are an extension.

6244 2018-10-16 14:28:00 They do.  It is called the weather report.  Also, they don't report that we are going into a solar minimum. That means global cooling.  When it is cold, we need heat sources and that includes energy from coal and oil.  (and why did they stop calling it global warming? FARSE!)
6245 2018-10-16 14:28:00 Poorly written one sided article, it's not only oil but, import, other financial investment, Russian Saudi ties, and most important USA will loose it's grip on middle East... Seems writer forgot all those points...

6261 2018-10-16 14:26:44 I love how people weigh in with little or no idea how government, trade or oil exports work. Thanks for setting them straight.
6262 2018-10-16 14:26:42 I’m sure you know but only about half of oil production goes to fuels. The rest is used for many commonplace synthetics you more than likely utilize daily. Carbon fiber for example - used to manufacture wind turbine blades.
6263 2018-10-16 14:26:37 Only problem is ISIS doesn't have rights to any oil, otherwise we'd find a reason to invade them too.
6264 2018-10-16 14:26:32 @dpradhanbjp @BJP4India The aim of this tweet is to urge @oilpr/ OIL to declare the results quickly and be a more responsible company. 1 year for declaring final results of an exam is too much time in 21st century. #accountability #PSUs
6265 2018-10-16 14:26:26 Oil prices fell on Tuesday on evidence of higher U.S. oil production & increasing U.S. crude inventories,but reports of a fall in Iranian oil exports helped to limit losses.
6266 2018-10-16 14:26:23 boiiii my feet bout white as hell forgot to oil them up 
6267 2018-10-16 14:26:19 Here’s the thing that makes me crazy, though: we only get 8% of our oil from Saudi Arabia. 12% from the entire Persian Gulf. We could stop depending on them in less than 1 year if we wanted

You do realize the Saudis and US have been working together to stop the terrorist state of Iran? They’ve been coordinating to throttle back global dependency on Iranian oil. That could be your family on the next jet airliner. It’s a sobering thought.

6322 2018-10-16 14:21:09 you have this bizarre need to defend a flawed system. when someone points out the flaw, you start talking about communism like bill o'reilly.
its like you have an old car that has worked pretty good but needs oil. you just say NO OIL... if that happens we'll all be walking!
6323 2018-10-16 14:21:09 No, that fragrance is actually affordable. The essential oil is insane.
6324 2018-10-16 14:21:06 Yes, but KSA has been shipping 5-8M b/d out of storage for over a year.  They can’t do this much longer... Thus the need for higher oil prices.  Historically, once they hit 160, they turn off the spigot.
6325 2018-10-16 14:21:03 Did you read the article yet? In it, I explained that it is not possible to embargo oil sales to individual countries (that was tried and failed in 1973/74) because oil trades in a global market
6326 2018-10-16 14:20:59 Data is the oil of the 21st century. But oil is just useless thick goop until you refine it into fuel.
6327 2018-10-16 14:20:52 Wheat and oil seem to be doing far better than gambling with bits of paper. Even with unjust sanctions, a productive economy makes more sense than a speculative bubble…
6328 2018-10-16 14:20:52 Hasn’t been properly briefed?  Jigar, c’mon.  It’s Trump’s party and facts don’t matter.  US oil & gas exports are soaring - good for both Cruz and Trump.  Exports and the US-Saudi-Russia friend group are Trump’s babies, not to be disrupted by planet saving.

The Brent Crude oil and WTI Crude oil fell by 4.43% and 4.04% to close at $80.43 per barrel and $71.34 per barrel respectively. 

This is as a result of increase in US Crude stockpiles by 6 million barrels and 1 million barrels rise in gasoline inventories.

6340 2018-10-16 14:19:43 @realDonaldTrump will support that the #Saudis simply "botched' an interrogation of an #EnemyOfThePeople. The world sees #blood on their hands, Trump sees #oil. #JusticeForJamal
6341 2018-10-16 14:19:41 What oil s a story?
6342 2018-10-16 14:19:41 Please stop hoodwinking people . It’s a known fact that Naira has lost some value but whose policies made that happen? This govt has used borrowing to make amends for the shortfall in oil prices and devaluation so I really don’t get your point here.
6343 2018-10-16 14:19:28 Thank you for the fast reply. I will be returning them tomorrow.

I figured that the Omega3 was from flax seed oil. SOME juice and egg producers do this, but I also have to be careful there as well.

Regular bars without Omeg3 would be appreciated as they looked delicious.

Plus they’ll be fretting about the price of oil going up, the morally corrupt bastards.
6365 2018-10-16 14:17:49 I had a dream I was staying with my grandma and. She had a bathtub that had a built in bubble machine, bath oil dispenser, and a coffee maker.

6367 2018-10-16 14:17:18 If anything I think Saudi’s threat of an embargo highlights how stable that regime is. Across the globe Venezuelan officials get sanctioned all the time and the last thing thay gov wants is to stop selling oil to the US.

6377 2018-10-16 14:16:29 Yeah, I feel so too. I think they may cancel the deal, just so the houthis get further control. Saudi's will have to lower oil prices then and increase production. It's all a game of blackmail prevailing. Sad how a mans murder is being used...

6447 2018-10-16 14:11:04 If the Saudis threaten to slow oil production and raise the price, the US should just stop buying Saudi oil altogether.  We are now oil independent and we are exporting US oil.  Stop exporting it and use it drive the Saudis into a financial abyss . . .

6454 2018-10-16 14:10:44 Idiot! I don't want any snake oil!
6455 2018-10-16 14:10:28 Oil is not stolen. It belongs to which ever company has the enterprise to extract it from deep underground. We dont spend billions extracting oil and then hand it over freely to random people living nearby. Those people benefit from jobs and commerce brought by the industry.

6460 2018-10-16 14:10:08 @petromatrix "Using oil as a weapon is the last bullet for any country so I don’t think [Saudi Arabia] will do that..."

The U.S. has been using oil as a weapon for years now; only, not be restricting supply, but by flooding it. Ask OPEC, Russia, et al.
6461 2018-10-16 14:10:01 I got a question for all you Tweeple. There’s a lot of growers out there, that’s a fact. But how many really know dry/cure/trim. Not to mention utilizing all of it?

6464 2018-10-16 14:09:46 OPEC said markets are well supplied that it was not fundamentals that were driving oil prices higher.....aka speculation.
6465 2018-10-16 14:09:46 The Automobile Association has warned motorists to brace for another fuel price increase as global oil prices remain “stubbornly high”.
6466 2018-10-16 14:09:41 Smart move!. Trump thinks it's good that the dollar is high. It's only good for travelling and some trade. It isn't helpful for oil prices, food and other products. I hope the majority of the free world boycotts the US until they wake up!.

6468 2018-10-16 14:09:30 Oil is a global market.  If Saudi sells no oil, the price skyrockets for everyone because demand remains constant but supply falls.
6469 2018-10-16 14:09:25 there are many countries in the world that can replace you, but is there countries can replace Saudi Arabia ?

do you think the 270 billion barrels that we have is normal !

nobody can replace Saudi Arabia, and you are Isolating and harming your self if you stop buying oil

6472 2018-10-16 14:09:15 Saudi Arabia will raise oil prices if they are rebuked. A great reason to encourage domestic drilling. The price will be slightly higher at the pump, but it create jobs, increases tax base and is plentiful for the interim.

6475 2018-10-16 14:08:58 How many extra barrels of oil were burned when Nalcor took back their 3rd line from Bay d'Espior application back, great defenders of the environment that they all are
6476 2018-10-16 14:08:52 The concern used to be "blood for oil". They've eliminated the commodity in the middle and exposed the essential truth: blood money.
6477 2018-10-16 14:08:49 He's there, making sure that they don't raise money on oil, like they said they would do.
6478 2018-10-16 14:08:48 The better question is what can we really do about it? They get pissed and stop oil production and they've got us by the balls and they know it. They deserve the hammer but how do you do it?
6479 2018-10-16 14:08:38 Canada isn't as important as Saudi Arabia. Canada can't send world oil markets into turmoil and isn't key to keeping Iran in check.

And we'll never know for certain whether an angry faction set-up MBS.

Condemn the murder and move on.
6480 2018-10-16 14:08:38 They used our people to fight their dirty wars, they enslaved our people, and they gave our land people to neighboring countries. If they got away with that,  they have every right to ‘want’ our oil!! And that is simply logical!!
6481 2018-10-16 14:08:31 Happy Tuesday!

Two cards came up for us today 

I can’t wait to make my oil blend for today with these possibilities 
6482 2018-10-16 14:08:30 55555555555 วันนี้หลับฝันดีแล้วค่ะ
6483 2018-10-16 14:08:25 Government bond prices ended higher today as FPIs are rumoured to have bought a huge quantum of the 10-year benchmark 7.17%, 2028 bond today. Fall in crude oil prices supported bond prices. The yield on 10-year G-sec ended at 7.87% against the previous close of 7.92%.
6484 2018-10-16 14:08:24 Nope. But I have a sample of the African black soap with peppermint & eucalyptus oil ready for you. Message me your address and I pop it in the post.
6485 2018-10-16 14:08:21 Believe it or not, if Saudi Arabia reduce oil production you might sleep starving. Remember that all wars are economical driven.
6486 2018-10-16 14:08:21 LOL.  No we’re not.  Oil would be $200/bbl in less than 3 months.

6489 2018-10-16 14:08:17 My mom was one of the earliest female executives at an oil company and one of the earliest female senior executives at IBM. She always reminded me and my sister, you can leave any situation in your life, personal or professional
6490 2018-10-16 14:08:11 Two excellent interviews today on @LBC on James O'Brian show re money, stocks, oil and Saudis plus re how the Gasbag won over US on Shelagh Fogerty show.
6491 2018-10-16 14:08:10 * PEDANT ALERT * There’s no “air” in the Citroën suspension. The spheres contain nitrogen, separated from the mineral-based green oil by a rubber membrane. Those suspension are very reliable actually. But many other parts of the XM weren’t...
6492 2018-10-16 14:07:53 the dog track regulators are WORKING for big oil since the year dot
6493 2018-10-16 14:07:52 Oil
6494 2018-10-16 14:07:46 A country that threatens to raise their oil prices to $200/barrel 
doesn't seem to be an ally or friend.

6499 2018-10-16 14:07:28 in 10 years No one will buy oil..Barbaric Desert faith will collapse.
Also when those uncivilized central Asians came India was divided into princely states till Afghanistan. Now India is a united country.We give medical Visas to Pakis Afghani n Central Asian to save their lives
6500 2018-10-16 14:07:26 From garden to plate. Another dish from our new menu. 
Potato gnocchi, kale, squash, parmesan, truffle oil.
6501 2018-10-16 14:07:13 The national reserves is double now despite record low oil prices and output.

Boko Haram no longer bomb different cities like they used to.

Projects the previous administration delayed and used to loot the nation are now being completed.

Pensioners are finally getting paid.
6502 2018-10-16 14:07:13 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
6503 2018-10-16 14:07:13 Oil depends babe. Kalau muka berminyak, teruk babe. Mcm aku. 
6504 2018-10-16 14:06:52 And all of those geologists get paid by believeing in it which is where the problem lies. There is no great conspiracy by oil companies or any company to get geologists onside and say they dont believe in MMCC.
6505 2018-10-16 14:06:48 That works two different ways.

And I like it.
6506 2018-10-16 14:06:47 “...it’s like the constitution said life, liberty and the pursuit of cheap ass oil from the Middle East” - my professor on American foreign policy  ((is he wrong tho... ))
6507 2018-10-16 14:06:44 Completely Disagree. @jkenney is not *secretly* bad at politics.  And we need to let him keep digging.  Tell him there's oil down there or something.
6508 2018-10-16 14:06:44 there's no mention of palm oil in the ingredients that I can see ..
6509 2018-10-16 14:06:36 The Repubs just disenfranchised most Native Americans in North Dakota and won't take their tribal IDs as voter IDs. On a brighter note they forced through the oil pipeline that leaked.

6512 2018-10-16 14:06:30 ICYMI: Mtn. Dew does NOT have an effect on mental health. Whoever told you that was feeding you outdated and inaccurate information. They were probably referring to a case of BVO(brominated vegetable oil) toxicity found in one guy back in like 1997. He had some health issues...
6513 2018-10-16 14:06:21 Pumpkin spice oil change?

6518 2018-10-16 14:05:30 @ToyotaGVL My 4Runner was repaired by the Collision Center over 3weeks where I also had an oil change. I drove it home this past Friday but has not started since & is inoperable. Good customer service would have offered a jumpstart or tow back to you. That has not happened. Help!

6520 2018-10-16 14:05:18 Under the IBB / Abacha administrations (1990 – 1998) Nigeria realised$199.8 billion; under the Obasanjo / Yar’Adua governments (1999 – 2009), the country got $401.1 billion; and during the Jonathan administration (2010 – 2014), Nigeria got $381.9 billion from oil revenues.
6521 2018-10-16 14:05:15 Translation: Some low-level Saudi intelligence agent will be sacrificed. The King and Prince will both deny knowledge and the US will be satisfied claiming they were tough in demanding answers. Meanwhile the oil market and weapons sales will go on business as usual
6522 2018-10-16 14:04:51 There are capitalist countries today that are going around invading other countries and murdering citizens all in the name of having access to those countries natural resources like oil. So I am not fooled by your tweet.
6523 2018-10-16 14:04:38 This sounds like blockchain snake oil.
6524 2018-10-16 14:04:38 I saw a strong reaction from S.A. last night , King called Erdogan while crying, He could not talk clearly due to crying. He begged for help. Wake up man Wake up , İf you dont have oil money You could die cuz of hungry.
6525 2018-10-16 14:04:33 Nos costó 1200 millones el barco, a eso súmale el gas y el fuel oil que importamos de Venezuela, El gas que importamos de Bolivia, etc etc. Miles de millones de dólares, ustedes sigan trabajando como lo hacen y no le den bola a nadie que este país está lleno de opinologos de 4

6527 2018-10-16 14:04:23 Done. Charles try to get from anywhere a shred of cloth or Holy Oil from St Charbel -Annay, Lebanon. Pray and ask him for a miracle. He rarely says no. Remember Faith is everything. GOD bless you and may Our LORD heal you.
6528 2018-10-16 14:04:23 If the left hadn't strangled our oil refiners capacity over the last few decades we would be independent of foreign oil producers right now. Or at the very least not in a position to have to worry about what they do & if Jimmy Carter didn't create fundamental Muslim terrorists...

6539 2018-10-16 14:03:48 Thanks to Kassie and Dane for bringing me their Volvo XC90 in for some tar removal, decontamination and some sealant. It recently was driven through some construction and road oil/tar was splattered on the bottoms. It’s now tar free and protected for the coming winter months.
6540 2018-10-16 14:03:27 How about Serena Shim, who just happened to die in a “car accident” while investigating Turkey flooding ISIS  with arms in exchange for stolen Syrian oil?

6543 2018-10-16 14:03:03 a blockade and boycott of saudi oil would shock the kingdom into the 21st century.
6544 2018-10-16 14:03:03 you can't just stop buying oil from Saudi Arabia because your country can not develop without energy.

and the last 4 million barrels that we sell it to you is a provement.

and don't forget your Indian brothers in the Arabic gulf

you need our oil, and you need our market
6545 2018-10-16 14:02:59 oil is one helluv a drug
6546 2018-10-16 14:02:59 Because he’s a true leader , Has a vision , Making Saudi’s economy strong , He doesn’t want to depend on oil in Saudi Arabias economy , Stopped the Iranian expansion ! , made Saudi Arabia one of the G20 was 20 then 19 and now it’s 18 in G20 in one and a half years ! Making jobs
6547 2018-10-16 14:02:59 Thank God! Kenney will write a personal cheque to cover the $8 billion annual deficit due to oil revenue shortfall. However, not convinced about the massive layoffs in health care and education cutbacks - Kleinitizing didn't help last time.
6548 2018-10-16 14:02:54 Oil show here we come for all them free goodies

6550 2018-10-16 14:02:38 I guess it could probably guess portion sizes better compared to just human judgement. But without knowing exactly what is in something then it’s only going to be best guess - can it tell if something has butter vs oil vs other stuff on it?How can it tell normal mayo from low cal

6555 2018-10-16 14:02:03 @BillHemmer @FoxNews @AmericaNewsroom no you do not take action that hurts America.  Leave the 110 Billion arms deal alone.  Hit them in the pocket book: OPEC!!!  Reduce oil imports from OPEC by 25%, increase America production by 25%
6556 2018-10-16 14:02:03 Young People have asked for cooking, oil painting on canvas, PS4 gaming, music studio and making scoobies at #enactyouth surgery, 4pm today. Youth Surgery enables young people to book space in the youth centre and work on something they're interested in.
6557 2018-10-16 14:01:53 Obviously KSA/MBS hasn't properly paid their Rubio and Graham surcharges this month cause Oil prices are soft and they are spending so much on their Trump family surcharges.

6561 2018-10-16 14:01:40 @olyosso @KayfabeJobber ok, so survived fluffmypillows, wolf bagging and daughter f**king, but finally reached my limit #PodOfThunder. Hearing these idiots describe what oil does in an engine, and how it can be the cause of a 'helicopter' noise had me screaming in rage! FFS

6564 2018-10-16 14:01:17 Check out our regular customer Kent and his beautiful Mustang GT. We did an oil change, rotated and balanced the tires, and finally changed the oil in the supercharger. That Mustang will hurt the feelings of people with Corvettes and Cameros!
6565 2018-10-16 14:01:16 Indian equities ended higher today, extending gains for the third straight session. on positive global cues, coupled with a recovery in the rupee and easing crude oil prices.
6566 2018-10-16 14:01:10 So what?
They were complete amateurs compared to us.
And when it was on the decrease, we regenerated it.
And in the process tainted politics for centuries, while we reaped the Imperial Benefits.
Whose oil did we steal by military conquest in Africa and the Middle east?
Grow up.

6576 2018-10-16 14:00:44 SA makes 2x profits supplying 10% less global demand at $200 oil vs. current demand at $80 oil. Look at what happened to global oil demand at previous recessions: demand doesn't go to zero or even halve, it just slightly declines, while prices double/triple.
6577 2018-10-16 14:00:42 Is like rubbing an oil tanker

Then pretty sure it was him that banged on the door and left..
6582 2018-10-16 14:00:14 Go to any oil change shop. It’s free lol
6583 2018-10-16 14:00:14 And of course the north is loaded with oil because of the warmth creating forests millions of years ago from the crazy amount of carbon released by cavemen using wheels...

6591 2018-10-16 13:59:30 It is amazing, isn't it? Chavez / #Maduro can send heating oil to Massachusetts for largely political purposes (help, yes; make gringo capitalists look bad, yes, too). But, we try to send aid / hospital ships, and suddenly every seaborne nurse is Jack Ryan plotting an overthrow.
6592 2018-10-16 13:59:27 The real question is how do they get the patchouli oil smell out of their uniforms now?
6593 2018-10-16 13:59:22 Quite a relief for you l guess, from war zone reporting to sugar and cooking oil reporting....kkk
6594 2018-10-16 13:59:19 @KaraWillow Hi Kara, I saw you were working on a piece around CBD. I'm doing some work for a CBD oil company, they're always happy to add a voice or send a product over if you were interested at all 
6595 2018-10-16 13:59:12 What the Saudis will learn, especially when it had threatened economic upheaval,  is the world will move at an accelerated pace to divest from oil and embrace alternative energy resources in the face of climate change.
6596 2018-10-16 13:59:02 I suspect jerry cans are also causing a shortage of cooking oil!
6597 2018-10-16 13:59:00 "most likely"...while the facts are so clear. Typical reaction of a western democratic country who does not care her own core values but only cares for the trade and oil. Credibility 0%..
6598 2018-10-16 13:58:51 Read Confessions of an Economic Hit man.   The Saudi government has had human rights issues long before this incident.  It's all about oil, in 1974 the U.S. offered the House of Saud a commitment to provide complete political and military support.
6599 2018-10-16 13:58:51 18 markets on my screens and all baring oil, which is pretty much flat, are up on the day. That seems right!
6600 2018-10-16 13:58:42 I pay $20 for an oil change at Mini Cooper and $10 for a full tank of gas at any gas station.  I’m hella cheap.
6601 2018-10-16 13:58:22 Apparently oil has something to do with it.

6611 2018-10-16 13:57:49 It's of strategic importance that Russia not get control of the oil market. They could starve out Europe and that would collapse the world economy. Europe buys most it's oil.
6612 2018-10-16 13:57:46 Oil 
6613 2018-10-16 13:57:44 To the looney left who DO NOT appreciate the USA NO LONGER being dependent on Saudi Arabia - our oil allows us to search for the TRUTH!!!!!  THANKS to the hard working petroleum industry & POTUS!
6614 2018-10-16 13:57:38 will you be saying that when oil prices go through the roof?  No, you will be complaining that @realDonaldTrump went too far.  

#hypoctrites
6615 2018-10-16 13:57:35 The ratio very much is. Practically, the ECA, Federation Account and SWF are seen as one big pot. It is law that makes us distinguish them. One could easily run an argument that the Ogun case is with respect to the SWF, as much as the Fed Account or ECA. It's the same oil money.

6618 2018-10-16 13:57:29 Why am not surprised that the editorial board of a DC paper missed crucial facts about oil and oil markets. 
6619 2018-10-16 13:57:29 Oh really. but none of this food is my favourite anyway. my favourite food is beans and fried plantain with gari and red oil. Herh the food dey bee keke #WordFoodDay #3FM972
6620 2018-10-16 13:57:20 As for last yr statistics USA is the largest producer of oil. It's no longer Saudis, it come number 2.
6621 2018-10-16 13:57:17 ooh, no palm oil in that one! :)
6622 2018-10-16 13:57:16 LOL. Most american used oil comes from America/Canada.

What we really shouldn't do is continue to sell Saudi Arabia weapons, which Trump just did a few weeks ago. And Trump is also being very, very kind to the crown prince and ignoring any evidence that he did something wrong.

6631 2018-10-16 13:56:01 Try cleaning off the burnt bits and lightly greasing the base with olive oil for example or spray on oil to prevent sticking. Jordan.
6632 2018-10-16 13:55:58 Investors in the fossil fuel industry act together just like the ogliarch, who cornered gas & oil before. It was Standard Oil, the ogliarch (baron capitalist) was Rockefeller. If only former autoworkers had the power to resist change in their careers.

6641 2018-10-16 13:55:25 So the US sells our own oil so we can be dependent on the Middle East oil?
6642 2018-10-16 13:55:21 In that case, is that probably not oil (engine or hydraulic), which is being vented from the heat exchanger? Fuel lines in the spine are rare.
6643 2018-10-16 13:55:12 Say these four words quickly:

Now you know how to speak with an #Irish #accent. :P
6644 2018-10-16 13:55:03 does Chicken Licken change their oil regularly? no
will i continue to eat there? fuckk yes
6645 2018-10-16 13:54:59 Every time I get my oil changed it takes over an hour. One time it took 3 hours. They over book and it’s annoying af.
6646 2018-10-16 13:54:57 I made my family taste test with me. General consensus was that the taste grew on you but little association with pine despite pine oil as ingredient. So fine but not sure I’d buy again! 
6647 2018-10-16 13:54:55 Sigh, so @realDonaldTrump has gotten played by the Saudis. He picked an idiots fight with Iran at their request and thus now has no alternative but to kiss Saudi ass to get oil and downplay the Khassoggi murder. #facepalm

6649 2018-10-16 13:54:42 @RobertsOhioD6 What's your take on levy for $8mil to build St C Highschool? I have no problem w/new schools that are needed but my beef is what the heck is St C doing w/all the tax $$ they DO get PLUS all the oil/gas $$ revenue that's been generated? Seems unfair to residents.
6650 2018-10-16 13:54:37 It was never about oil as much as it was Saudi Arabia opposing Iran, and Iran is the one country between the two whose actively trying to overthrow other MENA governments in the name of its clerical revolution.

Also Iran is possibly the biggest sponsor of terrorism in the world.
6651 2018-10-16 13:54:23 He is still a problem leader. The cannabis policy was inefficiently designed, the failure to own Canadian roles in Saudi warcrimes, the willingness to carry on with his predecessor's corporatist allegiances with oil industries. There are many things worth critiquing about.
6652 2018-10-16 13:54:18 sanctions on KSA would spike Russian oil.
6653 2018-10-16 13:54:16 Let me get my ass up and go get an oil change

6655 2018-10-16 13:54:04 I dont agree about funding Saudi yet we need their oil whether people like it or not... & if we didnt fund Saudi then Iran would've had terrorists taking over Yemen... & if they got a stronghold in Yemen! Then terror attacks would be taking place in Saudi Arabia next!

6660 2018-10-16 13:53:37 People who blue tick and disappear need to be put in boiling oil and cooked
6661 2018-10-16 13:53:31 Facts: Saudi Riyal and UAE Dirham are hard pegged to USD. Oil is traded in USD. Hence the strong current that drives their  currencies in any weather.
6662 2018-10-16 13:53:27 Its just pragmatism versus ideology. Environmentalists will happily shout messages to an oil company down a plastic microphone off the roof of a car.
6663 2018-10-16 13:53:23 Even if he didn't,I don't think it is worth fighting the Saudis over. Not that I am a fan of them(no sane person would be),but I do fear instability both in the middle East and the oil markets. Esp with Iran sanctions incoming,you can't fight Iran without Saudi help
6664 2018-10-16 13:53:21 Stop buying oil....
6665 2018-10-16 13:53:19 Interrogated to death, politics ( along with oil and arms sales) does indeed make strange bedfellows
6666 2018-10-16 13:53:14 What are you paying for in your #MCT powder?  Oil to powder ratios vary from 20:80 (bad) to 70:30 (good).  % of C8 and C10 vary too.  ASK cos to provide u w/info.  Where’s oil from?  Look 4 inulin and/or acacia fiber instead of milk or corn derivatives.  #fat #LCHF #keto

6672 2018-10-16 13:52:38 I say let Saudi Arabia can eat their oil.
6673 2018-10-16 13:52:35 Mam we should also raise awareness to cut petrol diesel usages, because we use and make Muslim countries rich. We need to educate Hindus in old days how we are pioneers without crude oil.
6674 2018-10-16 13:52:35 Something causes arbitrage. If you remove that something, everything will fall into place. The truth on the ground is that if your business imports, you need Forex, and unless you are doing fuel or cooking oil or bread, you can't get the US$$$$ anywhere else besides the black mkt
6675 2018-10-16 13:52:00 The healthy vegans I’ve personally met & heard from seem to eat larger meals 2x per day with the occasional snack, & minimize consumption of seed oils / grains.

The unhealthy ones eat more frequently / rely on ready-made products w/ high soy, seed oil, & grain consumption.

6677 2018-10-16 13:51:46 @POTUS, he will not sanction Saudi, because the King said that he will raise the oil price to $200 a barrel. Saudi, Russia, North Korea all have strong Men and for so reason that scares Trump. So this will be swept under the rug. Y do he stand up for these type of men?
6678 2018-10-16 13:51:45 In there refusal to investigate Judge Robert Altham's decision to ignore the guidelines set out by them, and recuse himself.

6692 2018-10-16 13:50:28 Regime change needed. Colonise, Christianise & civilise that barbaric desert entity & grab its evil-financing oil. Better for the West to have it & use its wealth-generation for good, advancing global civilisation.

6694 2018-10-16 13:49:57 Hi. It’s 2018. We now know the cost to tax payers by polluter companies and have evolved to agree they should be contributing to pay for it. That’s all that’s happening. Harper is balls deep in oil profits so he knows this already and just doesn’t want to lose a penny.
6695 2018-10-16 13:49:53 Don’t make this about Trump. Every American President and candidates since I can remember has been afraid to hurt the Kong’s feelings always worried about the god damn oil. Remember the pilots of those planes were Saudis!

6697 2018-10-16 13:49:43 Should he cancel the Arms contract that affects 500,000 jobs? Should he sanction Saudis which will result in oil and gas price increases for all Americans? I think he will use the Magnitsky Act against the perpetrators.....which probably won't be Prince Salman.
6698 2018-10-16 13:49:38 Never smoked tobacco, will never smoke weed. But my daughter’s severe neurological condition (dystonia) was miraculously cured with medical cannabis oil, so I’m not opposed. Just don’t force me to smell it or tobacco and I don’t care what you choose to do.
6699 2018-10-16 13:49:35 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
6700 2018-10-16 13:49:33 Democrat or republican. It wouldn't matter. Our economy is too dependent on their oil and they buy too many guns from us.

6719 2018-10-16 13:47:45 Data can be copied without judicial evidence. Mass surveillance is THE business model. While oil served just about everyone who could afford it, data serves only a few hundred super-rich at the top of the food chain.

6722 2018-10-16 13:47:36 I don't think their oil is what is keeping us over a barrel. Given how much smaller a share of the global market they now have relative to the 1970's, to hurt us with high oil prices today, they would have to cut back production a lot more than they can afford to.

6737 2018-10-16 13:46:32 But it’s okay for an administration to prop up coal, a dying industry? Or to subsidize oil? That’s the opposite of free market, Dr. Hexagon.
6738 2018-10-16 13:46:24 A few front institutes and basically the Koch Brothers. I am not even sure any of the big oil companies fund any of that shit anymore. Most of them have investments in renewables. I don't know what makes corruption of science inherently capitalist.

6740 2018-10-16 13:46:19 There's also a legal/moral/spiritual/supernatural argument that being Cherokee is a mystic status conferred by the tribe itself and if some oil contract manager in Oklahoma disavows her, that's the end of it. Some people take this argument seriously.
6741 2018-10-16 13:46:19 @karringtonsc  so glad you are better.  So glad you for oil rigging off SC coast. I live in Charleston SC. I want cheaper oil. With trouble with Saudi will our oil go up? Thanks for your service  good luck..will be voting repub.

6755 2018-10-16 13:45:23 2 be fair, he never claimed 2 support the Saudi Government, he stated that WWE has a signed contract. This is a fact, not an admission of support. WWE wouldn't dare 2 break a contract with a government that has the majority of the world's oil money. They'd get sued in2 bankruptcy
6756 2018-10-16 13:45:22 If you listened closely the only difference between her and Berman is that Berman wants to execute the oil sands now and  Notley wants to slice it's throat and let it bleed out.

6766 2018-10-16 13:44:53 I really do not care what the Saudis supposedly did to a journalist. That is a legal issue between Turkey and the Saudis. Not a U.S. issue. More importantly with Iran Sanctions and Russia issues ALL oil exporters WE DO NOT NEED $7/gallon gas stopping the economy..

6770 2018-10-16 13:44:36 There are always people against everything. Moving away from oil has loads of benefits. 

Taking us out of the hands of SA and Russia for one...

But yes, renewable are preferable but we need short and medium term power
6771 2018-10-16 13:44:36 50 years ago they taught us the world would run out of oil by 2000..
6772 2018-10-16 13:44:20 เค้าต้องบอกก่อนนะคะว่ามันอาจจะไม่ได้เห็นผลชัดเจนเท่ากับเราทาครีมบำรุงผิว แต่ถ้าเราเลือกใช้สบู่ที่มีส่วนผสมของ essentials oil ก็เหมือนเราช่วยบำรุงและกักเก็บความชุ่มชื้นให้กับผิวในทุกๆวันเลย.
6773 2018-10-16 13:44:17 @realDonaldTrump Then why is your son-in-law always there? And you do have plenty of interest in Saudi Arabia: oil and weapons.
6774 2018-10-16 13:44:06 Saudi Arabia is not only oil or money  or economy it is a historical country holding the cities of Mecca and Medina that had the highest spiritual significance for the Muslim world and having a huge military #SaudiArabiaGreatState

Recently saudis said they will like to increase oil supply and investment to india, clearly trying to woo new delhi in before they come out with explanation of Khashoggi's disappearance. 1/2

6779 2018-10-16 13:43:39 The dogs are going nuts because I just moisturized with almond oil (I got chapped skin from a longer than usual walk yesterday afternoon.) why? They want to eat it!
6780 2018-10-16 13:43:35 Even in New York advice was that it could. The Gov sacked the scientist & hired a chap from an anti oil group. He then used dodgy papers to say it couldn't, which were subsequently discredited in peer review.
6781 2018-10-16 13:43:34 No, you have failed to do that. How much revenue did oil bring in in 2016-17? You must know the figures since you are making these claims. Come on. Tell us.
6782 2018-10-16 13:43:32 It's actually about oil and keeping Iran in check. Always has been always will be.

Where did the majority of the 9-11 hijackers come from?? (Bush)

Where did a MASSIVE amount of funding come from during the Rise and reign of ISIS? (Obama)
6783 2018-10-16 13:43:21 Christians are not currently thinking with one mind, and this is honestly a problem. God's sense of humor is underestimated, and God's wrath is overestimated. I do not recommend buying your proverbial oil for your proverbial lamps after the actual wedding begins.
6784 2018-10-16 13:43:14 Previous is from me, add vegetables (leafy greens) to it. Gbure (water leaf) is great. You can consider kefir (Wara), beans, prunes and olive oil as well. Now let’s reach @zaheedayoola @bymzokus @ToluTheMidwife to give you the medical science response.

6797 2018-10-16 13:42:09 I don’t think they are being punished. With oil revenues down we need some sort of tax to make up for the loss of income.

 Saudi's pulled the Ambassador and all student doctors studying in Canada.

Saudi's have oil US wants it $$$$ talk.
6800 2018-10-16 13:42:02 With evidence found that #Khashoggi was killed in the Saudi consulate, the question now is how do you punish the worlds richest country? A country that also has total control of global oil prices.
6801 2018-10-16 13:41:54 Palm oil, never on the list of ingredients 20 or so years ago.  Looking at confectionery all I can say is never try your old favourites if like me you were born in the 1970s as they taste awful these days.  What happened?

6805 2018-10-16 13:41:33 Maria, I don't understand.  If we're no longer dependent on saudi oil and are able to produce enough for the US market, why are prices so high and fluctuating according to the price/barrel on the exchange?

6823 2018-10-16 13:39:10 So off course, you'll be increasing fuel duty, removing oil industry tax breaks and subsidies, reinstating electric vehicle incentives and perhaps even something bold like looking at grants to encourage businesses to switch to alternative power sources and processes?

6827 2018-10-16 13:38:44 One of the biggest changes in the past week (to me at least) is no one pushing oil stocks anymore. 

See my pinned tweet.
6828 2018-10-16 13:38:37 The petro dollar system is unwinding, the clever bit was its recycling mechanism, oil rich producers would buy US Treasuries, Are they now? Its not the oil that backs the green back, its the debtors that take out US denominated loans that back the green back, not oil.

Have another look at our oil discount.  

What we are giving away.  And what will take years for recovery. 

If indeed that can happen
6832 2018-10-16 13:38:14 Conservative record of climate-skeptic attacks and subsidies to oil industry give no reason to expect that they are the place for family- or environment-loving people to place their support.

6834 2018-10-16 13:37:58 I’ll chime in - a lot of my four-legged clients and their parents use CBD oil and swear by it. I recommend going to a dispensary and explain your condition. They’ll know what to recommend. One dog gets it daily for a neurological condition.
6835 2018-10-16 13:37:55 Pompeo is reassuring the Prince that the US will help make this go way so oil doesn't go up to $200 or more per barrel.
6836 2018-10-16 13:37:55 While you argue that it's not about land availability; it would be better to grow those high value crops for export coupled with our conventional cereal and oil crops like maize and soya for local use and export as well. This will mean that we generate more forex >

6839 2018-10-16 13:37:37 It is innovative way of corruption. PSU spend money on infrastructure or Oil exploration etc. The contract will be given to cronies knowing well of the out come. Once the outcome is not as per expectation the PSU looses money. And to bail the company they use other PSU fund.
6840 2018-10-16 13:37:31 Correct, it was to transport dilbit to east coast refineries. But, the refined products could very easily have supplied much of Atlantic Canada’s oil products and eliminated the need to import tanker loads of oil from Venezuela and/or Africa/middle East keeping $ in Canada.

6850 2018-10-16 13:36:35 Take 1-2 spoonful of coconut oil (if you can and have an original one). Drink 50cl-1litre of water first thing in the morning. When you go to the loo, sit and relax... RELAX. Let your brain do the work not your strength. If this does not work, consider over the counter laxatives.

6860 2018-10-16 13:35:44 I enjoyed my time there once I got used to the craziness, people will literally throw a monkey on your shoulder before you get a chance to consent, so be very vigilant and firm. Set your prices before you take any pictures, they will try and rip you off. Get some Argan oil too.
6861 2018-10-16 13:35:44 Made us think of the #Yuzu sauce sold at #TraderJoe's & how we use it: on @SpecialtyProd's #shishito peppers. We char the peppers in a little garlic oil over low heat in fry pan -- 20-25 minutes total time. Turn off heat, add splash of the spicy Yuzu & S&P. Delicious EVERY time!

6869 2018-10-16 13:35:13 ING Bank 1/4: #Eurozone exports increased 2.1% month-on-month on a seasonally adjusted basis in August, after a decline of 1% in July. Imports fell slightly in August and as this data is in nominal terms, this is surprising given the higher oil price.
6870 2018-10-16 13:35:09 It serves as oil control for me. And evens my face skin tone

6872 2018-10-16 13:34:40 Pertama : pake yang oil based, atau cleansing balm, atau milk cleanser

Lalu pake facial wash. Kalau akugitu hehe.
6873 2018-10-16 13:34:38 This frustrates me! China and India alone are huge polluters, yet Libs beat us up continually with guilt. Like two similar houses on a street. Mine is solar my neighbors is oil. But the country keeps telling me I can do BETTER!!
6874 2018-10-16 13:34:26 Ted is living in the 20th century. You need to maintain the oil industry as it slowly dies while encouraging 21st century renewable energy development. Duh! Vote for Beto! A better idea!
6875 2018-10-16 13:34:19 โห ดูปิดหน้าพี่ฮิมสิ 
6876 2018-10-16 13:34:15 Brilliant, according to you. if I want a new roof, I can start by drilling my own oil well, well after I build the drill, well after I build the metal forger, well after put a roof on the forger...  You guys are morons!
6877 2018-10-16 13:34:08 His ear piece buzzed “Huh? Oh yeah.  There IS a price actually and someone just paid it”.    We need that oil flowing.

6880 2018-10-16 13:33:49 @Oxhorn I love how the creator of the captain cosmos creation put so many coffee tins and cooking oil in his dungeon. XD makes building a slocums in every settlement that much easier. XDDDD also yay, lots of rare components for crafting! i'll take that duct tape thank you!
6881 2018-10-16 13:33:40 Let Iran invade that cesspool of arrogant nomads. Take all the oil and burn the place to the ground. @SaudiEmbassyUSA who needs Saudi Arabia
6882 2018-10-16 13:33:36 I use coco oil but don't fancy hair masks...
6883 2018-10-16 13:33:34 1/3 I know the Middle East is fraught with complicated issues and no one answer will fix everything, but perhaps we should invest in renewable power industries here at home so we can eliminate our dependency on Saudi Arabia's oil supply.

6888 2018-10-16 13:32:34 Anyone that thinks that the Saudi's will be held accountable are sadly mistaken. The POTUS's job is to make sure that oil prices don't skyrocket and tank the economy. He will do whatever it takes to make that happen, just like ANY POTUS would. That is the sad reality.

6891 2018-10-16 13:32:23 The USA actually gets most of its oil imports from Canada and Latin America. The reason you need the Saudis is guns. How big is that arms deal and how many Arab lives is it worth.

6893 2018-10-16 13:32:14 The Saudis would only be kings of sand without the oil. Trouble is they have never evolved from the camel herders they were
6894 2018-10-16 13:32:14 @seedandbean hi, to save me looking through each packet individually, can you let me know if your products are palm oil free?
6895 2018-10-16 13:31:50 Hi!  Thanks for the answer.  I realize that legally because it's highly refined soybean oil you don't need to declare it....but that doesn't make it any less of an allergen, as SOME people will still react even to that.

6935 2018-10-16 13:29:04 Another problem is that successive dutch government did not save any money from the revenues of the naturalgas, like they did in Norway from the oil revenues.

6961 2018-10-16 13:26:54 So the fact that the oil, that oh so conveniently,  was running out in 2014 just inconveniently keeps turning up in new fields is just an aberration that won't bring in more money.
6962 2018-10-16 13:26:16 What if we paid for it by excising the rents, management fees, and licensing fees paid by our oil and gas infrastructure to out-of-State interests?

6971 2018-10-16 13:25:52 Not to mention we have been allies since the discovery of oil. So because the Saudi government is against your Iranian friends don’t mean it is as simple as a “hotel”
6972 2018-10-16 13:25:51 #Saudis are not creative people. They’ve lived off the things they have inherited: Mecca, Medina and oil..status quo is vital for their survival. Hence critique of their oppressive tactics is threatening.

7002 2018-10-16 13:23:48 What???? You seriously think there is still oil revenue of significance? Look up how much revenue oil brings in now. Clue: it is not a lot. Where do you get this rubbish? Oh, the SNP.
7003 2018-10-16 13:23:48 Oil prices has been killing buisness across North America for many years !! Thanks to Saudi !!!
7004 2018-10-16 13:23:47 You mr @arunjaitley should be explaining about demonetisation disaster , rupee crashing and oil price hike , your obesession with Rahulji shows how scared you are of him . Oh we r not interested in ur blogs .

7008 2018-10-16 13:23:17 Keep buying oil from them and pay more with falling dollar.
Next saudi minister will say "Ganga is Clean again"
7009 2018-10-16 13:23:14 Now people are celebrating for buying a bottle of cooking oil. its so sad
7010 2018-10-16 13:23:11 Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said: “The oil market is suffering from short supply and this cannot be resolved by words. Trump thinks he can bring the oil prices down by bullying.” 
“Consumers are worried& Trump has failed to reassure them. That’s why market is in turmoil.”
7011 2018-10-16 13:23:10 No it wont were on the Singapore price, and its caused buy the High $ or the low $ or a cold Winter. Top tip wana lower oil prices, cancel all public holidays

7013 2018-10-16 13:22:46 I believe a pipeline is the best solution...that does NOT mean we do not need a plan to combat climate change.  What is the Conservative plan? Pipeline east is not meant to supply Canada....it’s purpose is to get oil to tide water and other markets.
7014 2018-10-16 13:22:45 ICYMI, I burned the midnight oil (or more accurately the 11:15 oil), and there's a NEW VIDEO coming your way today! This time: Emulation. See you at 2:30 Central!
7015 2018-10-16 13:22:39 For the record Saudi Arabia is responsible for 9-11! We always say Iran is the biggest sponsor of Terror... No that would be Saudi Arabia as well! They cant fight even with our best weapons... We should just invade Saudi & take their oil! Its what we always fight wars over anyway

7033 2018-10-16 13:21:39 This article paints a bad picture of Canadian economic and environmental policies. The best one is BC shipping coal and N.gas and have none of Alberta’s oil all the while screaming how they are saving the environment. Canada is certainly a ship of fools.

7038 2018-10-16 13:21:12 It’s not the oil, it’s that they are in bed with US$ that gives them their liberty. If we lose the Saudi support, America is fucked
7039 2018-10-16 13:21:06 Saw a video for a pan where you "don't have to use butter or oil!"

Bitch if you don't use oil or butter you're losing a lot of flavor
7040 2018-10-16 13:21:06 So if Saudi Arabia wouldn’t exist but for the protection that US provides, why don’t we just take over their country and, you know, take the oil?
7041 2018-10-16 13:20:49 My children are away at college, but I can still feel their presence. One of my angels didn’t correctly put cap on baby oil bottle and when I went to use some, oil spilled all over bathroom floor. Slick Sonya now has a new meaning.  #FixitJesus
7042 2018-10-16 13:20:45 Rich with money, not with faith or good spirit. These "christians" believe that if you wave a green hankey over some money covered in special oil, that god will make them rich. I'm not even joking. Ignore these fake Christians. They know not who they serve.

7049 2018-10-16 13:19:58 Trump sent one of his trumpanzees to tell the Saudis to stick to their story and cover up the abduction and murder. 
All so they can keep exchanging oil and weapons.
7050 2018-10-16 13:19:58 We already have a Scots government - after independence it would have the powers currently held by Westminster & control of Scotland's oil revenue. Scotland has various political parties  & would hold regular elections to appoint governments, as in other democracies.

7053 2018-10-16 13:19:47 Road building is a cargo cult, a religious idea. It makes no difference how often it fails, the faithful will always believe the next road will take them to motoring nirvana. Nothing is going to shift this except perhaps a major oil crisis. Which is inevitable..
7054 2018-10-16 13:19:42 Nothing will happen. Saudis own the USA.  Dependant on oil. They also own Trump, see Kushner  .   Business as usual.
7055 2018-10-16 13:19:40 You realize the weapons deal is public record, right? As well as oil purchases? But I forgot... You forgot Your “Muslim Ban” when the Muslims in question are billionaires willing to trade..

7067 2018-10-16 13:18:53 This is disgusting!  

Why are they cutting power?  Is it to conserve energy for oil production?

7093 2018-10-16 13:16:29 our dependence on imported Saudi oil is one part of the oil question. B/C they have traditionally acted as a swing producer, they still have a lot of influence over price, even if we import less. This is even true as we are looking to take ~1mbd of Iranian crude off the market

7097 2018-10-16 13:16:18 "If socialism cannot be blamed for Venezuela’s demise, perhaps oil is the culprit. The most calamitous stage of Venezuela’s crisis has coincided neatly with the sharp fall in international oil prices that started in 2014. But this explanation is also insufficient..." etc

7100 2018-10-16 13:16:12 Lets see, lets sanction them so they can raise the oil prices and we can pay $5.00 a gallon.. and while we are at it.. lets let them buy 1.5 billion dollars in military weapons and equ from Russia and China instead of the USA. Open your ignorant eyes fool.

7122 2018-10-16 13:14:06 Oil. That's all of it. The U.S. is heavily dependent on oil b/c of our ridiculous transit costs. Heck, Ford is ceasing production of cars for U.S. markets to focus on SUVs. Meanwhile, across Europe they drive rather small, fuel-efficient cars. WTF?
7123 2018-10-16 13:14:03 Yall I got so much avocado oil on my beard. My shit greasy as hell.

7133 2018-10-16 13:12:52 The main reason the UK don't want Scotland to leave is because they would never survive without the oil revenue money.
7134 2018-10-16 13:12:50 ooooh this is good lookin' out. what a waste of 85 dollars WOW. any recs for a good oil cleanser for dry skin? i love the s*nday r*ley one but i suspect its got bad ingredients too then
7135 2018-10-16 13:12:50 Finally you have realised that MoNa has been feeding you snake oil and you've been gulping it down hoping it's Desi Ghee.
BJP is a FRAUD
MoNa = $onia
UPA3 = NDA2
7136 2018-10-16 13:12:48 TRUE but with nuclear weapons you get mutually assured destruction. With the oil weapon you get a lopsided impact which damages KSA/OPEC more than the customers in the long run

7138 2018-10-16 13:12:33 The Saudi’s are good puppets:
1. They buy American manufactured arms
2. They invest in the US
3. They export oil and manage price
4. Follow our lead on foreign policy
5. Collaborate and share intelligence

Our partnership with Saudi’s is important and appropriate.

Corn oil could be “murderseed”

...you get the picture.
7141 2018-10-16 13:12:00 Iran and its politicians have said the same thing after the implementation of Trump oil sanctions that it will respond, and of course Iran's known response is not direct, just move its sleeping cells from a sympathetic or follower.    Continued

7143 2018-10-16 13:11:57 The real GOP agenda is big business, especially oil and gas. Climate change is in the way of their agenda. Big oil & gas are going to burn every drop of gas and oil on the planet, and dam the environment! Money counts the Earth doesn’t!

7145 2018-10-16 13:11:50 1) Inertia 2) Because they fear that Saudi minus the royal family would look like Syria. 3) Saudi spends a lot of money on influence to make sure that doesnt happen 4) Lower dependence on imported oil is a relatively new phenomenon.

7152 2018-10-16 13:11:27 My boyfriend changed the oil in my car, washed it and vacuumed it, all while I was out partying with the girls all weekend...  I’m so blessed.
7153 2018-10-16 13:11:25 Go on, defend big oil. Then make your taxpayer clean up when the company goes bankrupt right after they've extracted all the oil they can. New law proposal: if they file bk before cleaning up, permanent ban fron the industry in any capacity for everyone at the company. Everyone.

7155 2018-10-16 13:11:05 If you plant rice, sprikle some salt, oil the rice with a bit of pepper and seasoning, it germinates into Jollof rice. You can eat it directly from the soil.

7161 2018-10-16 13:10:46 no doubt biofuels have a lot to answer for. personally I also prefer to avoid palm oil in food & personal care products as much as possible. Tricky as it sneaks up everywhere !

7163 2018-10-16 13:10:32 If Rahul Gandhi is "CLOWN " then what about Arun Jaitley. Why the dollar is on the higher end. Why the oil price is increasing. Why our PM has to call upon "Saudi King" to reduce the price of crude oil. When the crude oil was on lower end why oil price not reduced in India.

7171 2018-10-16 13:09:53 "The best known businesses". No one gives a good God damn about the inequality in sectors like nursing, oil rig maintenance, sewage treatment and hundreds of other male- or female-dominated jobs. They only want equality in high-income positions, which are less than 10% of total.
7172 2018-10-16 13:09:43 So what happened?

How did so many descendants of tough, independent, wise first and second generation Plains Staters become so narrow, susceptible to Right Wing snake oil, gullible, mean spirited?

7187 2018-10-16 13:08:20 The US is a prostitute for the Saudis, willing to sell itself for oil and defense contracts.  The US even sends it's soldiers to sacrifice for the Saudi rulers against Iraq and now Iran.  Ironic that it was Saudi citizens that attacked the US on 9/11/2001.

7203 2018-10-16 13:07:03 yea I think the same, this seems very vague and doesnt divulge the geopolitics of Iran and Venezuela or any others in regards to oil. Seems like a deep state talking point
7204 2018-10-16 13:07:02 Starting 4th November 2018, India will send rice to Iran in the exchange of crude oil. With this modern form of the old fashioned barter system, our dependence on the American dollar will be less and our Indian rupee will get a new life.

7216 2018-10-16 13:05:44 It is mostly the fault of consecutive Italian governments, but also the EU played its part. E.g. I am all to allow Moroccoan oranges or Tunisian oil in the common market. But without compensations, Sicilian farmers end killings themselves.
7217 2018-10-16 13:05:41 Who knows it's all guess work. They may only sell a few and stop. Can't see them selling all of them at the same time Oil is Gushing from #Horsehill.

7230 2018-10-16 13:04:03 Apologies guys, but the middle East conflict, in all its manifestations,  was never about oil, its a mechanism for the justification of arms expenditure which provides a lucrative revenue stream for whoever walks the halls of power and their associated cronies. Both US & UK
7231 2018-10-16 13:03:59 The sounds like the Edmonton Oilers pre-season record 
7232 2018-10-16 13:03:58 Or you could invest in your own oil fields, produce your own coal/fuels.

7255 2018-10-16 13:01:52 Me, after getting a full night's rest: So guys, uh, not to be a snake oil salesman or anything but have you heard of sleep?? I think it works?? Granted it'll take more testing, but wow. the sky is blue & I don't hate that birds are singing? What.
7256 2018-10-16 13:01:51 We’re also going to hire 5,000 more Border Patrol agents, but don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
7257 2018-10-16 13:01:48 Saudi Arabia with its strategic oil reserves needs a stable ruler.MBS seems to be a reckless one with none of his recent initiatives working. Looks like we have an anarchist on our hands. Geopolitical tensions to rise?
7258 2018-10-16 13:01:44 I'm losing followers as quickly as the USA hijackes countries that have oil reserves
7259 2018-10-16 13:01:38 Shortages are real guys, i have been in the same bracket till reality donned to !e yesterday in Byo, all major supermarkets had no cooking oil, no soft drinks, no bread, and the fav Mazoe syrup, or its substitute Bally House juice. OK rationing commodities.
7260 2018-10-16 13:01:31 Couple of things this “armchair economist” suggests:
- the oil patch had evolved and even if the activity reaches highs of it hay-day its would use much less labour. 

- it’s an evolution in energy not a shutdown. 

- pipelines are not the problem, not even a symptom

7264 2018-10-16 13:01:07 I use coconut or sunflower oil for moisturiser. The sort you buy in the cooking oils section of a supermarket.
7265 2018-10-16 13:01:07 The government of Croatia has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Padma Lakshmi in a gannex wig.
7266 2018-10-16 13:01:01 Petrol (LKR 39,803m), Motor cycles (LKR 33,688m), Gas oil including diesel (LKR 26,664m), Hybrid Electric Vehicles, 1000-1500cc (LKR 20,899m), Undenatured ethyl alcohol (LKR 14,189m) were the top tax revenue earning commodites in 2017

7268 2018-10-16 13:00:54 Saudi Arabia government is NOT righteous, Saudi Arabia is the enemy of GOD, USA needs to end the relationship. Traitors keep it going for oil/money.
7269 2018-10-16 13:00:49 Agricultural investment through feasibility study is key in food production, i.e Ksh7.3 B allocated to the Galana Kulalu project. But only 103.000 bags produced out of projected 20 million bags. Snake oil project which has no return on investment.  #ZeroHunger #SMEconference2018

7278 2018-10-16 13:00:03 Seems a lot of the American venting at MbS over the consulate murder also contains frustration about Saudi Arabia’s lame strategic objectives, and evil means of achieving them in Yemen. Also resentment that they  have us over an oil barrel.

The usa actually exports oil. We dont need the saudies oil. It's all political. Why export oil, th et n import it from over seas?
7317 2018-10-16 12:56:25 Girlllll I kept licking my lips yesterday and went home lathering my shit with coconut oil. Woke up today feeling soft and smooth as ever. 
7318 2018-10-16 12:56:23 Yep, always prepared for anything with Oil, will still be looking at that level for entry though, keeps price inside triangle and at gap resistance......stops will be in place where move is invalidated
7319 2018-10-16 12:56:23 Elizabeth Warren should have never done that. Water and oil don’t mix.  Honesty is not a virtue when there is a wide acceptance of dishonesty. We are losing one thing making us great-our naive but well grounded trust to one another. Vote dishonesty out on November 6.

7341 2018-10-16 12:53:57 His reforms will create no jobs since most of KSA is built on slave labor. And their oil revenue is split among monkey monarchy family wasting on 24k toilets. Saudi Arabia will be punished severely if they don't IPO their golden goose in US exchange or lower oil prices.
7342 2018-10-16 12:53:54 Corrupt UK in the 21st century. If this was going on in a country with oil anywhere in the 3rd world we would be bombing, invading and then stealing in the name of justice.

7353 2018-10-16 12:52:33 Oh good. I hope Saudi Arabia *does* have a tantrum and force oil prices north of $400/barrel. Maybe that'd snap repubs awake from their "drill baby drill" pipe-dreams and encourage new American investment in fuel-saving & renewable energy tech.

7390 2018-10-16 12:49:11 ん゛あ゛ぁ゛……よるちゃ……しゅき……
7391 2018-10-16 12:49:10 We have way more enough oil reserves for all Canadian plus export to meet global demand! Why we need to import oil from other countries like Saudi Arabia and USA? Something wrong with Canadian energy strategy?
7392 2018-10-16 12:49:08 Obama, Clinton, & Bushes ALL sold weaons to the Saudis. Trump is a buffoon but this is standard US policy. Regardless of how corrupt and feckless the Saudis are we’d rather take their money and oil.
7393 2018-10-16 12:49:06 There’s only one market where it could work and still I don’t think it would (California), right now they can’t do this. the fleet that you need to do something like this is in the tens of millions. Also oil is not going anywhere between 400. There are more important things.

7396 2018-10-16 12:48:52 Is that an email to you from big oil, PHRMA, big coal, Wall Street etc?
7397 2018-10-16 12:48:52 Agreed in the mean time it could be tricky, and haven’t even gotten to Venezuela coming back (eventually). Agreed about full cycle costs but at 80 oil sands starts humming. That being said,wtis breakevens vols and ti/Brent spread all show no chance Saudi shuts 2mm bbls in

7400 2018-10-16 12:48:42 Saudi threats to raise oil prices are hollow. The US is the world’s largest crude oil producer. Last year, US daily exports totaled nearly seven times what we import from the Saudis. Any price rise would benefit US producers and, in the end, damage the Saudis.
7401 2018-10-16 12:48:36  why? Do they have AI or robotics research?
They r only oil corp as far as i know
7402 2018-10-16 12:48:36 Where do you get the CBD oil from and is it independently tested for purity and strength?
7403 2018-10-16 12:48:26 Yah but $400 oil is good for the economy. #WTF

7407 2018-10-16 12:48:07 Which shops cause looks like some chaps have their own shops they buy from. The majority of us find shops empty on basic like cooking oil. For example Bellevue Choppies in addition did not have any drinks. No delta soft dinks, no cascade, and all juice drinks not available today
7408 2018-10-16 12:47:59 OIL: Oil prices fell on evidence of higher U.S. oil production and increasing U.S. crude inventories, but reports of a fall in Iranian oil exports helped limit losses.
7409 2018-10-16 12:47:53 #TOM could easily be AIMs big winner for q4.  Needs a successful trial. Confidence from previous programs in the 1980’s that only halted due to low oil prices gives the current trial I expect a high COS.
7410 2018-10-16 12:47:49 Pompeo should not be there. He does not speak for our country. He speaks for Trump, maybe; for Big Oil, definitely.
But he does not speak for US and our so-called "values".
I regard this as a blatant slap in the face to the rule of law, to decency, to justice. SHAME ON POMPEO.
7411 2018-10-16 12:47:32 The Trudeau/Butts Liberal government doesn't give a crap about the opinion of Canadians, they have set out to close down oil production and stop the use of fossil fuels period. They are so blindly sure that only their superior opinions matter they do not listen to the peons.

7422 2018-10-16 12:46:59 I find the soles are flat/fatal at about 3 months. And the leather gets stiffer, even with regular mink oil. 3/10. 
Thorogoods. I rate them much higher. And Golden Fox are excellent as well.
7423 2018-10-16 12:46:49 If OPAC countries not agreeing to reduction of crude oil price,then we should stop all exports of essential commodities to these countries

7425 2018-10-16 12:46:37 how this works:
1. you have to be able to locate an ancester who is registered on the roles. many Native did not register.
2. with income from casinos, cigarettes, oil, etc some tribes are prohibiting new members and actually purging to avoid sharing income.

7428 2018-10-16 12:46:01 The dollar is based on illusion in a fiat system.  There is no backing for it.  Currency value doesn’t rise and fall with the whims of opec.  Government interference and powerful energy/petroleum conglomerates are why we are still addicted to oil.

Olive oil reduced coronary artery plaque 50%!!! Wow
7439 2018-10-16 12:44:48 This dude just asked me to start my truck. All the oil is on the ground dude.
7440 2018-10-16 12:44:30 Their support for this regime is sickening. But hypocrisy is as common as air these days and has to be accepted. Trump is not going to upset the billions of dollars the Saudis give them for weapons. Nor wants oil supply disrupted. This incident will be quietly put away.

7442 2018-10-16 12:43:57 I’m just a Twitter doofus but what’s even the cynical case for staying allies with the Saudis when we’re now the world’s #1 producer of oil
7443 2018-10-16 12:43:54 2H19 is a year away, and $80 "breakeven" for oil sands does not consider full-cycle costs, and oil sands (or other sources) cannot ramp 2+ mb/d until 2020, but Saudi *can and will* cut off supply by that much in a week.

7445 2018-10-16 12:43:23 We (US) are going over there to kiss their ass because they have us over a barrel owning 1/3 of all oil reserves on the planet. Renewable /alternative energy is the way to get away from being owned by this brutal monarchy.

Truth, I AM a bit sexist. I've always seen the most un-masculine thing is the inability (or the unwillingness) to do a thing. Can't cook? Not manly. Can't do your own laundry? Not manly. Can't change car's oil? Not manly.
7448 2018-10-16 12:42:53 For folks who use oil for heat: A programmable thermostat and ceiling fans on low pushing air downward will help your house feel warmer.

7450 2018-10-16 12:42:36 Perhaps you are thankless. The way saudi rulers managed their oil wealth has benefited millions,across generations, across continents particularly us  Muslims

Indonesia refining capacity is around 1100K bbl/day

- 6% increase in housing and rents is NOT inflationary
- 10% increases in medical costs and insurance is NOT inflationary
- 50% rise in bond yields is not inflationary

7520 2018-10-16 12:36:04 I hope the JiffyLube guys that changed my oil this morning didn’t judge me for the mess of random things I have in my back seat 
7521 2018-10-16 12:35:55 Unfortunately big companies DO represent the public - as long as we buy oil based products, they can afford to lobby governments #QandA
7522 2018-10-16 12:35:48 To make pastry, we need to use a commercially-made pastry fat. This is vegan but many companies who produce this fat use margarine made with palm oil. We recognise that every raw material we purchase have an effect on the environment. [3]

7529 2018-10-16 12:35:06 If this happened in a country like Syria/Iraq it would be much more high profile. But Saudi Arabia has lots of money and oil, therefore gets skimmed over because we're too scared to upset them.
7530 2018-10-16 12:35:03 Went to get coffee, found an old lady struggling with her tires. I pumped up all her tires and checked her oil. She was moving home and had cat paintings in the back of the car. We become besties.
7531 2018-10-16 12:34:53 Not surprised about the Jacob Hoeyy's cbd oil review. I also took the oil being completely unaware of how to start taking cbd properly. I stayed awake all night. Hemp oil can have an invigorating effect on some people and that is my case. Being part of many fora for chronic pain,
7532 2018-10-16 12:34:52 The reality of the situation, of course, is that any real world solutions, ones that come from actual workable ideas rather than what crackpots and snake oil salesmen are selling involve a lot of hard work, and incremental changes to reduce chaotic effects. 3/

7534 2018-10-16 12:34:49 Has its escaped everyone’s mind the the majority of 911 terrorist were from Saudi Arabia? Why are we discussing anything w/ them?  Oh that’s right trump and his oil obsession! Plus they are all crooks!
7535 2018-10-16 12:34:43 MCT oil is dangerous 
7536 2018-10-16 12:34:34 If an oil embargo happens, where does that leave the folks who bought SUVs and pick-up trucks? Even the threat of one can send those commodity traders in a feenzy.
7537 2018-10-16 12:34:23 mabuti nga di halata kanina ehhh im applying tea tree oil to it :))))))))
7538 2018-10-16 12:34:22 There is no money. There hasn’t been money for close to a decade. Subsidy is one problem. If oil prices are high, the burden rises, once they are low, no revenue
7539 2018-10-16 12:34:01 Chutia, where is the price of crude oil in the chart, all the false promises done by ur father have been exposed now
7540 2018-10-16 12:33:58 Be careful Pompeo don't go inside any embassies. Look what happened to the other guy. The Saudis are so rich they are dangerous. Let them make the price of oil go up to two hundred dollars a bbl. The USA is engergy efficient so why would it hurt the USA? It would hurt the others.
7541 2018-10-16 12:33:38 I don’t think they want the price of oil so high it throws the world into a recession.
7542 2018-10-16 12:33:26 “You claim”...do you not believe that tankers are coming out full of oil Bee? The other truth is that these tankers haven’t really had any effect on the sp at all...wait until big news is announced then we will see. 
7543 2018-10-16 12:33:25 And since your car starts every morning there is no need to worry about changing the oil then.

There are literally 1000s of scientist around the world saying climate change is real and we should worry about it. But ya since it was +1c in YYZ this morning so it's fake news.

They get the arms, we get the oil, the rich get richer, the status quo retains its imbalance.

7564 2018-10-16 12:31:22 Colorado is ahead of its time vs. many states.  Cannabis and renewables are new and viable industries within the state.  Oil and Gas is still big in the state, but less labor intensive than days of old.

7566 2018-10-16 12:31:15 What is the dollar based on then? Where does it’s worth come from? Also, the oil companies have control over entire governments including our own. Why haven’t New energies come out in the last 100 years?
7567 2018-10-16 12:31:14 It’s nice having a newer vehicle so when you go get an oil change they don’t tell you that you actually need $1,000 in other work done

7624 2018-10-16 12:25:19 Hedge fund managers have continued to take profits on their bullish positions in crude oil as the late summer rally has faded and fears about oil consumption and the state of the economy have replaced concerns over sanctions on Iran.

7633 2018-10-16 12:24:30 That’s fiat currency narrative.  Currency, buys goods.  Not just oil.  When a dying industry no longer commands the currency, it shifts to other industries or revenue streams.  The consumer moves on far faster than the industry.

7646 2018-10-16 12:23:10 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.

7649 2018-10-16 12:22:45 An Atikulate President wouldn't wanna build refineries in the North for oil in the south 

then ranches and colonies in the south for cows in the North

@mbuhari How would u ship the oil for exportation?
7650 2018-10-16 12:22:32 what essential oil will make me stop procrastinating
7651 2018-10-16 12:22:30 We don't need no stinkin oil from Saudi Arabia! And the economy will certainly not be tanked by boycotting these criminals. Wonder if you remember which country sponsored the 19 plane hijackers on 9/11.
7652 2018-10-16 12:22:28 Oh..Katharine..yes..oil
7653 2018-10-16 12:22:26 "U.S. President Donald Trump cannot bring oil prices down by "bullying" other nations" #Iran's oil minister said on Tuesday, adding that "the market was suffering from short supply".
7654 2018-10-16 12:22:18 I asked why they wanted VP slot in a zoo,but they can't reply.
7655 2018-10-16 12:22:10 This is not about money this is about controlling shipping lanes unless some of you guys have great public transportation systems and don’t use plastic or leather or anything processed w oil. And if you guys would like to cede the region to Russia and China just keep at it
7656 2018-10-16 12:22:08 How misinformed you are, can understand it's not easy to grasp everything about India in 4 years. We   started importing oil from Iran in 2015 , Actually we discovered Iran in 2014.
7657 2018-10-16 12:22:05 i hate unscrewing the cap, popping the protective lid, then grab the spatula, then scoop and smear on palm, the pop back the lid and cap. oh lord with oil i just pump
7658 2018-10-16 12:22:02 Praying! Please avoid all sugar as it feeds cancer cells. Pls research CBD oil (legal in all 50 states). If u can get access 2 raw cannabis juice in your state its the most potent anti-cancer treatment Ive ever found.  It’s much stronger/better for later stage than CBD. 
7659 2018-10-16 12:22:01 Exactly like all the oil countries airlines. Political favors
7660 2018-10-16 12:22:01 Oops..sorry...oil. Thought you were speaking of another artist. Too many twitter threads.
7661 2018-10-16 12:22:00 Spiders hate peppermint oil. Put some in a squirt bottle + water and spray your garage and all door frames.
7662 2018-10-16 12:21:58 The Saudis are as vile and disgusting as YOU. WE made them rich buying their oil. And now they lord over our heads their reprehensible human rights violations while we DO NOTHING! THE most despicable society on the planet is Saudi Arabia and we are on a fast track for second.
7663 2018-10-16 12:21:50 Thought you were a man of your word. Or just a con man in a Chinese made suit. 

There are good people on both sides. 

I believe Putin, Rocket Man and the King of Oil over our own intelligence agencies.

7678 2018-10-16 12:20:23 Your skin is trying to over produce it’s own oil to compensate. Try throwing in a facial oil at night. My recommendation is either jojoba (closest to our natural sebum) or hempseed (lightweight and doesn’t clog pores)!!!

7690 2018-10-16 12:19:19 Adam - 19% of US oil consumption was from imports. More than 1/3rd of that from Saudi. This year the estimates are 16%. It’s been dropping every year. Don’t see the argument for Saudi reliance. Proven reserves discoveries over last decade in UAE-ex Saudi more than cover capacity.
7691 2018-10-16 12:19:17 That’s pure unadulterated bull dust Scotty Boy !The oil companies treat the Australian Govt with utter contempt !  Just like the banks do & have . Your just like the barbers cat all piss & wind !

7703 2018-10-16 12:17:20 True. It’s funny how regs are they tight yet fracking is allowed! Everything I have read about fracking it detrimental, yet right now it’s our cheapest option so we go no matter the damage it does. Like I said though peak cheap recoverable oil has already come and gone.

7709 2018-10-16 12:17:01 They REALLY needed some peanut oil.
7710 2018-10-16 12:17:00 To some extent, yes. For instance, it’s odd for average middle class conservatives to prioritize oil company profits over clean air, but they do, and often mock liberals for caring about the climate. That seems delusional.

7740 2018-10-16 12:13:51 The US dollar is called the petro dollar because the world buys oil only with USD. If oil becomes obsolete, our currency loses much of its worth and since every other currency is tied to the dollar they will take a hit too.

7792 2018-10-16 12:09:17 I know many who use M.Oil for pain relief & they’re seeing excellent results...no more harsh pharma drugs!
7793 2018-10-16 12:09:12 This may not hinder our arms deal and oil trade. Priciples come second. Greed is good. Fuck Yemen.

7797 2018-10-16 12:09:03 When projects were finished here in Can. Oilsands
the land was restored
better in fact

The Carbon Tax will do more harm than good
Stop it, stop the massive regulations
the massive red tape
the driving away of investors
instead

7800 2018-10-16 12:08:37 The correct instinct at that point is, “ok, I’ll go change the oil myself” or  ya take a chance of some bumblekin leaving the fill cap off or the filter loose or whatever shortsighted incompetent crap these “parts changers” do.

7818 2018-10-16 12:06:35 Nope. We have enough oil. And it is even better. But Iran develops strong ties with India and China, while Russia benefits from the rising price on the global market.
7819 2018-10-16 12:06:31 Thats a wierd combination,  kinda like water and oil
7820 2018-10-16 12:06:29 I wouldn’t say that it’s economy  being held back by oil. It’s being held back by its citizens that add up to a poor country.

7826 2018-10-16 12:05:56 But then why not help NaMo in his quest by supplying oil, diesel and gas at a reduced price? To clap hands one needs both hands! So you all think NaMo has done a lot to ease in doing business. Why not earnestly join your hands to that of NaMo's to help him.
7827 2018-10-16 12:05:56 just enough plausible deniability to allow the west to sell them weopens and to buy their oil

so, we’ve all killed him basically...  all feeling very reformed and modern
7828 2018-10-16 12:05:56 I am not begging the question sir. It is not news. The facts are there. Oil was at its peak during the last administration what did we make of that?? 

Anyway, I am not having any political argument or discourse this year. I did that aggressively in 2015. 
To each his own.
7829 2018-10-16 12:05:51 We got basically everything we wanted, we lost a bit on milk, 2 years on drug patents, a bit on export, won a lot on cars and oil.

Meanwhile, the con position on this trade deal was: It's great, it's horrible, it's ok, we had to give less, we had to give more, and so on.

7930 2018-10-16 11:57:17 “oil prices inched lower Tuesday as investors anticipate that Iranian crude lost to U.S. sanctions will be replaced by supply from other major producers.” -WSJ
7931 2018-10-16 11:56:49 Lets start by making Canada energy autonomous ! Once we Accomplish that , we no longer have to bring in oil from terrorist regimes and we can start dictating the rules for a change !!  Sounds pretty awesome to me !!
7932 2018-10-16 11:56:47 The funny thing is you are sending us pictures ekuti shops restocked iwo mashelves  ema luxury goods agara angaakangozara. We need pictures of shelves full of sugar, cooking oil, Mazoe, bread etc . The basics not food only afforded by those with disposable incomes
7933 2018-10-16 11:56:44 @realdonaldtrump How’s it too expensive to fix, you orange shitgibbon? Renewables r more cost effective & generate more power than either coal/nuclear. Can also be setup where needed. Start there. Tesla is outselling Merc, so electric cars r next so oil’s future is OVER, you Doos

7939 2018-10-16 11:55:40 For your knee, you would first a “carrier oil,” then peppermint oil, black pepper oil, arnica oil, and wintergreen oil, then wash your hands, it burns. All mixed in with coconut oil or you’ll have a rash. The smell is nice, and it’s anesthesia effect. A numbness, better than pain
7940 2018-10-16 11:55:38 Please do not share your feeling like modiji's man ki baat .Diesel prices have been hiked for 11 days in a row, despite a decline in the rates of crude oil. Rupee2.5  reduced and 2.5 increased govt. Is mocking with public once public starts mocking with govt.
7941 2018-10-16 11:55:36 Gusto ko imnon ang olive oil
7942 2018-10-16 11:55:32 Just like myself curing myself of stage 4 stomach cancer with Collidial silver, full spectrum cannabis oil and vitamin b17 apricot kernels. Over 3 years ago..... With no pharmaceutical poison.... Thats Bull as well is it?

7944 2018-10-16 11:55:19 Good to see PM modi calling all global oil companies CEO and Saudi ministers to address the oil issue. No one before has tried to convince OPEC countries on scrapping Asia premium on India.
7945 2018-10-16 11:55:10 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
7946 2018-10-16 11:55:09 There is no morality in world affairs. (Albeit that could change w/ a Corbyn-led govt.) Money talks. Oil talks. The stock market talks!
7947 2018-10-16 11:54:59 Energy and oil companies are awful and huge contributors but the animal agricultural industry is also one of the biggest contributors (land needed, forests cut down to grow huge amounts of crop for livestock, methane from cow farts, the list goes on)

7955 2018-10-16 11:54:19 wow bumaba yung peso ng about 30 cents? is this even seen as achievement? the mere fact na 25% less ang value before.

one big reason why oil price is so damn high in the local market.
7956 2018-10-16 11:54:13 She also published a recipe, featuring human hearts, in a cookbook called ‘Aztec Appetizers.’
Her secret is to add extra virgin to your extra virgin olive oil.
7957 2018-10-16 11:53:54 Add to that losing global market share when Russia is pumping at full capacity and US shale is on the sharp rise at higher prices. Using oil as a weapon may be effective in 1970s but not now, that is for sure

Add baby potatoes,a sweet potato and some chopped carrots. Cover. Cook,couple hours or crock pot.serve over noodles

7965 2018-10-16 11:53:13 But before you start you say things like "I'm going to oil you", and "I'm going to sand you". Had you been consistent for the cabinet, it would have very misleading as to what you were about to do.
7966 2018-10-16 11:53:06 Pompeo would have brought bone saw oil if instructed.
7967 2018-10-16 11:52:54 After adding peppermint oil to my peppermint tea, I think I can see the spacetime continuum.
7968 2018-10-16 11:52:51 Gritty is the least of their problems. You gotta let it go Glen. Deep breaths and lavender oil.
7969 2018-10-16 11:52:33 If Scotland had voted yes it would have an £8b black hole in its budget from false oil rev predictions. It would be outside the EU and the UK with who knows what currency 
7970 2018-10-16 11:52:29 It was just getting an oil change.
7971 2018-10-16 11:52:28 We need to get rid of the GOP as they are linked and supported by oil. We need a real leader who can take decisive action. Trump despite his bluster is a coward of the worst kind. He attacks the weak and glorifies dictators. He needs the 25th ammendment and removal.
7972 2018-10-16 11:52:12 @SecPompeo #pompeo .  You flew in rush to save your Arms deal with #KSA and #MBS. So training finished now for fabricating #Khashoggi murder? You were head of #CIA. Keep it hidden that you were behind this PLOT. Have you blackmailed #MBS for lower oil price and double prod?
7973 2018-10-16 11:52:09 No pete,i didnt say that,but its the only thing i have issue with,im not knocking your pics,and its good to show proof of oil flowing,feck and his pipeline pics is a different matter though,especially after scc fracas,now that is bullshit

7975 2018-10-16 11:52:03 Oil optional. Make it hurt
7976 2018-10-16 11:51:47 Trump's hesitancy to criticize Saudi Arabia for murdering a journalist is a great example of why it is time to end our dependency on oil. And there is always the Saudi ties with the 9/11 attacks! #OilandGas #Oil #SaudiArabia #CrudeAwakening
7977 2018-10-16 11:51:21 For India w/ the ₹'s drop, #oil is already more expensive now at $85/brl, than it was back in 2008 when the price hit a record $147/brl. 

Worse, the prices are not higher on rising growth, but supply falling! And w/ the subsidies largely gone, it'll get severe for people.
7978 2018-10-16 11:51:03 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
7979 2018-10-16 11:50:56 US does not need the #Saudis for #Oil or anything else.  But apparently #Trump / #Kushner need them for their un-bankable real estate deals. 

The once leader of the free world is abdicating it’s moral compass so the #TrumpCrimeFamily can finance their money-laundering racket.
7980 2018-10-16 11:50:53 @WaltDisneyWorld confiscated my @GreenRoadsCBD oil when I was going into EPCOT yesterday because it was “in a glass bottle”. Yeah, ok. If there was ever a park that causes social anxiety, EPCOT during the Food & Wine Festival tops the list.

7983 2018-10-16 11:50:06 India rupee CRISIS: PM warns of SOARING oil prices as rupee hovers near all-time low level. Narendra Modi urged suppliers such as #SaudiArabia to help ease concerns of soaring oil prices, which have contributed to the Indian currency plunging against the #USdollar.

7994 2018-10-16 11:49:01 Year 11 artwork - pupils were asked to create a monochrome oil pastel study for their portfolios. Well done to all the artists on their great work!
7995 2018-10-16 11:48:49 This is one of the sector Obasanjo Atiku and Jonathan ignore all this year while looting the country and they still think they can do better will low resources when they are unable to develop the country when income from oil revenue was higher then now
7996 2018-10-16 11:48:46 @theJeremyVine on today's show you ask what can we do against the Saudi Gov't, in light of  the alleged murder of the journalist #Khashoggi?
Suggest we work hard to create an alternative to oil. Once perfected we can send the Saudi’s back to the dark ages where they belong.

8002 2018-10-16 11:48:12 Not literal shit!! I keep forgetting how literal Twitter can be. But I do add fish sauce, soy sauce, sesame oil, and Sriracha.
8003 2018-10-16 11:48:11 Avocado oil, grape seed oil, Peppermint oil especially
8004 2018-10-16 11:48:03 If your life is falling apart, nothing coconut oil and tea will solve xxx
8005 2018-10-16 11:47:59 Oil company *profits* really are orthogonal, and indeed they profit more from scarcity and high oil prices than from abundance. There's no evidence that state/socially owned fossil fuel production is more environmentally friendly.
8006 2018-10-16 11:47:47 Great thing about putting coconut oil in your coffee is that it moisturizes the hell out of your lips.

8009 2018-10-16 11:47:28 A policy will achieve its goal only if it is credible. Even KSA with more than $700bn fx reaerves could not weather the oil price shock of 2014/15. Iranian gov’t has always been selling to keep the market balanaced but until they propose a comprehensive economics-based plan ...
8010 2018-10-16 11:47:08 Kind of like how it was “inappropriate and wrong” (and, IMO, immoral) for Warren, other pro-oligarchy politicians, and corporate media talking heads—such as yourself @TuckerCarlson—to completely ignore the #WaterProtectors standing up to Big Oil. #boughtpoliticians #mediastooges

8013 2018-10-16 11:46:53 Yes, and IScot could, in time, reopen it's stock market that Labour closed 3 years after we struck the oil discussed earlier, so there is still lots of potential for an IScot. Not saying any transition would be easy but certainly doable with our resources and talent.

8016 2018-10-16 11:45:55 ban Saudi oil from being imported into Canada immediately. or 100% tariff. Enough! Eastern Canadians can damn well freeze. Enough talk ... act. Your current plan declares war on Alberta and Sask and lets Saudi off scott free.
8017 2018-10-16 11:45:46 It's not like this is the first time ksa has committed human rights abuses they've been massacring innocent people in Yemen for years whith the help of US weapons.
Us presidents have always looked the other way because of oil interests and weapon sales

8024 2018-10-16 11:44:59 We must import oil only from those Nations who agree to import commodities of equallent amount from our Nations. We must not pay foreign currency to such Nations. A new barter system need to be settled therewith. International INR value may rise again if we put stress on export.
8025 2018-10-16 11:44:50 ...they cannot manage the Fox market. On public investment, consider the crowd out effect, inflationary pressures, plus structural inefficiency, that’s key in pub inv failure in Iran. Pub inv is always good but it should be planned such that as oil prices change it is carried on.
8026 2018-10-16 11:44:48 TRUMP does, we know how he lives the oil! Also HE has investments there and borrowed lots of $$$$!
8027 2018-10-16 11:44:48 
8028 2018-10-16 11:44:46 Perhaps not investing and building more oil pipelines might reflect a motivational starting point?

8040 2018-10-16 11:43:44 Does look a bit arid, tbf. Easy to bake with really, bit of herbs, lemon juice and/or white wine and a touch of olive oil. Prefer haddock to cod in the chippy too, cod are dirty fish, bottom feeders.

Of course you don’t have a clue...that’s because you have zero experience in the oil industry and have to ask me questions

8044 2018-10-16 11:43:35 @ScottAdamsSays I have to try your smoothie recipe. Sounds delish. Have you tried coconut oil instead of almond? It coats the tongue as if you'd used ice cream - like a milk shake.
8045 2018-10-16 11:43:29 It's indeed a new and futuristic issue. In the past this happened with banks, manufacturers, steel and oil corps, etc.

But the power of Google and Facebook cannot be understated. They are the plumbing of the modern era, so it's important to handle it properly.
8046 2018-10-16 11:43:29 I was eyeballing the argan oil one and another I'm blanking on that makes hair shine. Mine is dull.
8047 2018-10-16 11:43:27 @JimNorton @travistefft @notsam struggling restaurants would "accidentally" burn down cos owners threw) icy water into boiling oil. The oil explodes and the oil catches fire from the gas burners. Mum explained it as "Oh they got struck by Jewish lightning" It was 20 years ago.
8048 2018-10-16 11:43:12 Sometimes having the opportunity to make a choice in this country is a luxury. A lot of people jus go with the flow. 
Like you studied geology because of oil deposits in the country but you end up in a bank taking deposit.
Man's gotta eat.

8052 2018-10-16 11:42:29 BBC is despicable. The US & UK have imposed a food blockade on Yemen creating an engineered famine. Millions will die this winter if not lifted. It's Genocide.

Venezuela have had targeted sanctions imposed on them including exporting oil which has crippled their economy.
8053 2018-10-16 11:42:16 Like most things they only hear about what the big names earn, not what the bulk earn. Having said that, some industries definitely pay themselves much better than others (oil, finance, some branches of the media)

8069 2018-10-16 11:39:58 I refuse to exit my room till Thursday, therefore, I’ll shall dunk my head in oil and moisture said head
8070 2018-10-16 11:39:54 People in the oil and gas industry work super early  I just send out an email and got a response real quick
8071 2018-10-16 11:39:33 Lol I will even try.
They can eat boiled yam and palm oil .
1 slice of yam each
8072 2018-10-16 11:39:29 the only other pictures I had taken at my most recent con had me looking like an oil slick mmmMMM :-(
8073 2018-10-16 11:39:28 Naah will happen sooner. Shanghai oil futures contract is in RMB. China will buy oil from Iran soon. India and Turkey might follow suit.
8074 2018-10-16 11:39:15 @mrjamesob James, Mo made it would like US was reliant on oil from The Kingdom - fact is the US gets 9% of its oil from Saudi Arabia and has been consistently reducing this %. The issue isn’t oil it’s Arms Sales and we are afraid that Saudi will turn to Russia or China..my 2cents
8075 2018-10-16 11:39:14 Yes I was aware of that. My point is if you take Motiva and their demand for Saudi (their own) oil in America, that the actual demand for Saudi oil in America is effectively much smaller than 900,000 bpd. The remaining amount is small. Maybe similar to Iraqi imports.
8076 2018-10-16 11:39:08 That means the government collects more GST. So they have no interest in stopping this lube behaviour. The barrel (oil) was over $100 in 2011 yet we were an average $1.44 a litre. It is only $71.20 a barrel at present and we are paying an av 1.57 per litre. We’re getting ripped
8077 2018-10-16 11:39:02 That makes sense - it seems that to be truly sustainable, it can only be retrospective - ie, the PO plantations were not previously rainforest/peat. if the palm oil palms aren't grown there where will they be grown? What about RE forestation? So many questions @orangulandtrust

8087 2018-10-16 11:38:19 Venezuela is a country of 31 million people now the are starving due to two factors, the drop in oil prices and reliance on one product. The USA is increasingly reliant on the service sector. Unlike our manufacturing expertise we had during WW2.

8113 2018-10-16 11:35:23 Just makes it more apparent that the world needs to cut its reliance on oil and get our of there. Their hatred of each other in that region will ultimately bring down all of their shiny buildings and reduce it to the sand from where it came!

3. Diplomats are going push fiction to ease friction.

8147 2018-10-16 11:31:24 Just ate at my favourite Chinese ramen place tonight. Ordered my usual / favourite. However, it left a weird oil in my mouth, so I couldn’t finish it. Now, I’m feeling a bit queasy and nauseous. 
8148 2018-10-16 11:31:23 Imagine we just ran out of oil. No petrol anywhere. What do you think how long it would take to have EVs that do everything you want. Plus have the infrastructure available everywhere? Not very long!
8149 2018-10-16 11:31:19 No. It won't go that far. Its my sincere hope that the 5th President will use 90% of oil revenue to invest in Turkana, 10% national reserve. It's the only way to open up the country.
(25% won't make much impact and open up the country).

8150 2018-10-16 11:31:17 The deal we made with Saudis is we would protect them and they would sell oil in US dollars. If they have the ability to protect themselves then they don’t need us.

8165 2018-10-16 11:29:25 Yes, agreed, but accelerate *that* by wishing for $400 oil now?! Again, you and I are talking different time frames. We already agree on the longer term solution, but we also need an immediate solution.

8183 2018-10-16 11:27:27 As it happens, I was friends with one of these anti-science nuts for many years. Over dinner one day, we were talking about the day we eventually run out of oil and the guy straight tells me that God himself is replenishing it as we use it. Same for the climate, I guess.

8186 2018-10-16 11:27:11 @realDonaldTrump Impossible to be exempted from India, India will either completely cut off its oil by November 4 or face a devastating storm that will overthrow its economy, it is a very serious matter. Heavy sanctions and heavy tariffs are on the way

8193 2018-10-16 11:26:22 $400 oil would lead to an immediate global recession, causing millions of people their jobs and homes. Although $400 oil would accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy, please be mindful of the immediate impact to all involved.

8197 2018-10-16 11:25:55 Makes sense . A man with no morals or principles.  Sad indictment on his presidency,  when Saudi oil money is the driving force behind this event #JamalKhashoggi #DonaldTrump
8198 2018-10-16 11:25:54 Epsom salt bath? CBD oil? Magnesium oil spray? They’re probably a drop in the ocean if you’re in agony but maybe worth a go?
8199 2018-10-16 11:25:52 From what I understand working conditions for workers was a problem for Malaysian oil palm producers who backed our of#RSPO. Will the new govt look into improved working conditions? There may be other reasons.
8200 2018-10-16 11:25:45 Crude oil futures for Nov/Dec lower Tuesday morning. $WTI_Crude -0.88% at $71.15, $NBZ_F -0.79% at $80.14, $USO -0.56% at $15.04 for 10/16/18.
8201 2018-10-16 11:25:45 I just bought ten quarts of Mazola, because apparently if you have enough oil you can get away with murder, and there's a few people I'm pissed at right now.

I know you'd like the SoJ to not invest in oil companies on principle, but would you also support a ban on the products
8207 2018-10-16 11:25:09 Wow just watched a documentary exposing how bad the fashion industry is for the environment - one of the top 5 pollutants with coal and oil. Thank you @StaceyDooley for bringing attention to this

8209 2018-10-16 11:24:52 Its simple Aleesha, Money & Oil. As long as the Saudis keep spending on weapons and keep the oil flowing they can basically do what the want. The faux outrage at the murder of a journalist is purely for home consumption

Shame on you BBC.

8221 2018-10-16 11:23:53 Maybe in these circumstances England would prefer to get their oil and electricity from other sources than Scotland if they wish to make trade difficult with us. Perhaps they could get it from Europe...oh wait

8230 2018-10-16 11:22:05 You are despicable. The US & UK have imposed a food blockade on Yemen creating an engineered famine. Millions will die this winter if not lifted. It's Genocide.

Venezuela have had targeted sanctions imposed on them including exporting oil which has crippled their economy.

8235 2018-10-16 11:21:39 What could Britain do against Saudi? 
Nothing.
They invest billions into our economy. They supply us with the oil that produces our products that we think we have a god given right to own. They buy our weapons, pretty much our only export. We are Saudi Arabia @mrjamesob @LBC
8236 2018-10-16 11:21:35 I opened my  bonnet a few times already to refill what need to be refilled. It dawned on me I haven’t checked transmission fluid so when I did , it was almost empty. I’ve resorted to checking myself as workshop didn’t refill all during the last service - just the engine oil.

The @Greens facilitate the crimes of Saudi Arabia by preventing the global use of nuclear energy.  If nuclear was the global norm for energy production countries lik Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Iran wouldn't have the oil money to do what they do.

8238 2018-10-16 11:21:31 But snake oil salesmen and other conmen WILL ALWAYS SELL YOU INDIVIDUAL STORIES, because they sell you emotions and not facts! And people like you let yourselves be convinced by sheer emotions rather than study any facts.
8239 2018-10-16 11:21:23 They were then(begin 90's) a little ahead, because he was already nationalizing land, Banks, large foreign companies etc.. The EFF road forward is exactly the same. Only thing is that Chaves could keep it going a bit longer with the 120$ oil price. After that, downhill fast.

8244 2018-10-16 11:20:30 Well, the reference ought perhaps to be natural resources more generally. Including mining charter debates in SA, but also increasingly populist discourses around oil wealth in Iran, Venezuela and so on. The basic point of reference is scholarly debates on "resource nationalism".
8245 2018-10-16 11:20:28 I am *petrified* of those nodding donkey things that get oil out of the ground. I feel sick even thinking about them and refuse to go to most of America just in case.

8269 2018-10-16 11:17:37 No, he will just use billions of OUR tax dollars to clean up the horror and mess, while major oil and gas companies can save those same billions by not being responsible and making our climate changes worse, yeah, sounds about right
8270 2018-10-16 11:17:30 If price of oil rises by 10%, there will probably be an increase in the investment of oil exploration which may lead to increased demand for oil rigs

8290 2018-10-16 11:15:48 Seems true to a large extent. I was hearing the BP Chief Dudley yesterday and he was clear that EV are still far down the timeline to make a perceptible difference in Oil consumption. Oil demand will remain high with so many disruptions etc.e.g. Iran sanctions

These Millennials, born in the 1890's,  are killing oil lamps, horseshoes and ice carts.
8315 2018-10-16 11:12:49 If oil Co s had shown some flexibility a "deal" could have be struck at "X" $/ Barrel of crude oil s. However, the oil Co s had strict INSTRUCTIONS from their boards not to exceed "Y".    "WHAT NEXT" asked the oil Cos   ;'    "LISTEN TO THE RADIO" Yamani replied.

8321 2018-10-16 11:12:13 Again, my comment was in reference to the 2% of GDP of the oil sands, not the energy sector. Great opportunity for growth in clean tech, a multi trillion dollar global industry.
8322 2018-10-16 11:12:08 I think one way in which we can downplay the importance of the Saudis is to stop using oil. Impossible? Then I guess they will always win.
8323 2018-10-16 11:12:03 eggplant steakes, risotto's, pasta with garlic (very slow and on a low fire, with the vegetable oil you like, in a frying pan, till it get a light brown/golden color) plus cooking the pasta, the way you like but it has to be Italian pasta.
8324 2018-10-16 11:12:01 Enron was a oil trading company and it folded during George Bush’s first term.
8325 2018-10-16 11:11:46 “Your ppl”...get out of my country and don’t come back! It’s YOUR country that was behind 9/11 attacks! Fact! The brick shitting is SA. The ONLY thing SA has is oil. U have 2 rely on the rest of  2 survive

8327 2018-10-16 11:11:35 Whoever thinks President Cyril Ramaphosa has a bearing on the price of crude oil ...is delusional.

8329 2018-10-16 11:11:23 Unscientific hogwash. If you care about animal welfare you’ll buy palm oil free margarine.
8330 2018-10-16 11:10:56 Any province that gets 25% of its revenue from oil has made the fundamental blunder of being far too heavily reliant on an industry of the 20th century. The world is moving on.
8331 2018-10-16 11:10:54 We don't need there shitty oil!!
8332 2018-10-16 11:10:54 これは激萎え案件ですよ……
8333 2018-10-16 11:10:48 That is exactly what it is - Western interference and economic sabotage due to refusal to grant unmitigated access to their oil. How dare Venezuela try to protect its sovereignty. Also, the regional alliances (PetroCarbie, Alba) posed a threat to American bullying in the region.

8344 2018-10-16 11:09:58 I have never drilled for oil, but I can analyse BP .... I have never attended a yoga class, but I can analyse LULU . We are talking about financial data, not products. Many fine products have died on the vine due to poor finances and poor management.
8345 2018-10-16 11:09:48 Please talk them into not using sunflower oil.  I’d love to try them, but am deathly allergic to this commonly used oil.
8346 2018-10-16 11:09:43 Its you who need to open your eyes there is no cooking oil in the shops.

8360 2018-10-16 11:08:01 Here comes the bs, US oil companies need to ramp up operations anyway,  there is enough supply to have prices below $40pbl and gasoline below $2.00 per gallon. They are disgusting companies continuously gouging consumers.
8361 2018-10-16 11:07:49 You really shouldn't foray into economics: 1. Ten years back USD was at Rs 53. Imports are paid for in dollars, remember. 2. UPA subsidised fuel by issuing Oil Bonds and left the servicing burden on the fisc. 3. Resultant avg inflation 10 years back soared to 11%. Egg on ur face.

8372 2018-10-16 11:06:38 Nobody was born yesterday. And stop protecting murder, because u want them to bring the price of oil down in opec.

Had you come earlier
8378 2018-10-16 11:05:58 The US pampers Saudia for its oil. More or less the same thing. I know you would rather live in the US than go back to your country because of the freedom in the US. Freedom is important; go back and topple the monarchy back home living large on your country's oil
8379 2018-10-16 11:05:54 Again, your argument regarding Trump/Putin is nonsense.

Again, considering Trump ...

1. Imposed harshest sanctions on Putin
2. Strengthened US military
3. Wants NATO to strengthen military
4. Installed missiles in Poland
5. Challenges Russian oil diplomacy 
6. Is arming Ukraine
8380 2018-10-16 11:05:52 There is no cooking oil in most shops in Zim,

8386 2018-10-16 11:05:32 Have you tried tea tree oil
8387 2018-10-16 11:05:27 Me I think we are in bigger trouble than we realize. The world is changing and it’s changing very fast but we seem not to realize. We are not producing anything in Nigeria. We are not exporting anything tangible other than oil and we import almost everything
8388 2018-10-16 11:05:23 Hey, can I have some oil, dis bitch is thirsty
8389 2018-10-16 11:05:13 Yesterday's trade data shows a weaker picture for non oil imports. Remember that most external imbalances correct with an economic slowdown rather than exports growth. It has probably started.
8390 2018-10-16 11:05:10 Dead skin cells of the body can be removed by applying mixture of olive oil and salt. Replacing salt with granulated sugar can work too.
8391 2018-10-16 11:04:46 ... all to impress the leader of another country that has large oil reserves.

8401 2018-10-16 11:03:37 The price of oil has fallen from highs of about $112 a barrel in 2014 to below $50 at the moment.The slump in global oil prices has hit Nigeria hard.The government depends on oil sales for about 70% of its revenues.I guess you were looking for appointment just like Buba Galadima

8405 2018-10-16 11:03:03 Fact is 
India started trading rice for oil with Iran way back in 2012.

8410 2018-10-16 11:02:35 Nope..an independent country inside the EU..with 60% of its oil reserves. 30% of its gas, and 25% of its renewable potential...
8411 2018-10-16 11:02:29 Short answer: no. Long answer: of course not. With billions of dollars worth of #arms on the line, and the threat of an #saudi oil embargo, nothing will happen. Just more #business

8413 2018-10-16 11:02:20 NBF’s Warren Lovely had a note last week re: Canada’s “gift” to the US and discounted oil prices. He estimates its at least $25B/year - should be a topic discussed weekly until fixed. Canadians losing out, a financial ‘nightmare’ of our own doing.
8414 2018-10-16 11:02:16 I had the same problem with a jiffy lube except on top of that I wound up not only having to put washer fluid in my car but had to go get a whole other oil change at a different place 2days later because all my oil had leaked out and I had a bad filter on it.

8422 2018-10-16 11:00:59 Apt answer is moorkhtha of Congi.

8445 2018-10-16 10:58:29 Excellent article. Two and half years old. Fake headline. Should read, oil refiners support $10mm lobbying effort to push back against government EV subsidies.

8446 2018-10-16 10:58:22 Whole world is working in harmony to destroy the murder case of journalist #JamalKhashoggi. USA eyeing $110 billion in arms deal from Saudis, rest of the world want cheap oil, Muslim countries want Saudi Riyals. And journalists are trouble anyway.

Forked tongues glided and teased slowly together as Loki’s hands guided himself in slowly.

8455 2018-10-16 10:57:37 Ultimately Jaitley realized the truth after being in Govt for 4.5 years.We see the growth in bashans& reports but in reality it's missing.High oil prices, depreciating rupee,less jobs, farmers suicide, communal divide made life miserable for ppl& still you continue to fool ppl.
8456 2018-10-16 10:57:31 @narendramodi @dpradhanbjp @PMOIndia Can a Crude exchange be initiated where Crude Oil can be sold as a group, where the identity of the origin of oil can be kept hidden and open for purchase for anyone at the regulated price. Payment also can directly be made & not through $?
8457 2018-10-16 10:57:23 British values. What British values?
 Prostituting your country to oil sheikhs for profit is a great infication for those British values.
8458 2018-10-16 10:57:19 13 million at risk for starving in Yemen. Same country that has supported terrorism and ISIS for years. Oil rich. Water poor. They have had lots of money to support terrorism and fight a civil war. My sympathy card is punched out. Let them reap what they have sown.

8461 2018-10-16 10:57:09 A rise in oil prices to four-year highs is heaping pressure on big emerging-market crude consumers such as Turkey, India, Indonesia and South Africa that are already grappling with current account deficits, weak currencies and rising inflation.
8462 2018-10-16 10:57:02 You’re never a Buharist Malam. Buhari never led Nigeria into recession.The price of crude oil dropped to less than $30 per barrel.That’s what led Nigeria into recession.There are other countries like Saudi etc were all in recession due to crashed in prices of crude oil.

8467 2018-10-16 10:56:38 Truth is Trump would rather defend a lying criminal regime like Saudia Arabia so we won't have to pay higher oil prices... protecting government interests, its what they do No matter if its right or wrong.

8488 2018-10-16 10:55:25 This should drastically reduce prices as its no longer linked to oil prices?  Can you make enough power to drive the countries needs for electric cars?  I buy from Scottish power but own a diesel van
8489 2018-10-16 10:55:15 I had a strange dream about 5 months before the Deep Water Horizon oil platform disaster. In it I heard wrenching & straining of metal and it was all dark and had a feeling of April not sure why. In April when they showed the underwater video of the wreckage I knew had dreamt it

8495 2018-10-16 10:54:47 What is clear for that  Bush and Obama did nothing about the government of Saudi Arabia having a role in killing 2977 Americans on 9/11. Planned,financed, and nine hijackers were Saudi! For oil and strategic reasons we have been bowing to the Royal family for decades! Fact!
8496 2018-10-16 10:54:41 If we are still dumb enough to say there’s no global warning bc the oil and gas industry own the GOP. Then we deserve to burn here on Earth! To bad people are so gullible to only listen to the ##PornPresident and not scientific fact!

8499 2018-10-16 10:54:21 Side note: UK land mass = 94 sq/m
UK would need 80.3 sq/m of wind turbines at full capacity all year round just to replace current gas alone. Replacing coal & oil wold require area half the size of Europe just to power UK... and we'd still need oil for when there's no wind

8501 2018-10-16 10:54:12 Totally - I remember the 90s when the enemy was fossil fuels and chickens in sheds.  magically, now the problem is cows in fields and the oil dependent stuff is better!? lol
8502 2018-10-16 10:54:10 What did we win? The trophy of victory from being on the winning side is not that tangible. At least after ww1 we claimed the oil in the Middle East.

8506 2018-10-16 10:53:32 Having the best economy in Africa is nothing remarkable given the fact that Nigeria is Africa’s number one producer of Oil and Gas. 58 years after independence we should be comparing ourselves with India, South Korea and Brazil. So where are we on that scale?

8578 2018-10-16 10:45:33 Where are the prices and have we been told the conditions to buy that cooking oil. Recently a certain Spar shop demanded that one buys at least $5 worth of groceries to qualify to buy 2 litres cooking oil
8579 2018-10-16 10:45:29 Imagine if we had a leader that said "Let's save our planet like Kennedy said let's go to the moon"? We'd do it! We are such a brilliant people! We'd unite. Don't let big oil money continue to destroy us. Rubio sure is not that leader.

8583 2018-10-16 10:44:48 No, but it's part of the long term solution. Passively safe fission, and fusion power afterwards, are the easiest way to kill coal, oil, and gas power, with the smallest environmental footprint.

8599 2018-10-16 10:43:34 I disagree. He ran as a standard-issue Republican, promising huge tax cuts for the rich, more xenophobia, punishing women for abortions, bombing the sh*t out of enemies & taking their oil. His "alternative" health plan was total bs. His tone of grievance was the key factor.

8607 2018-10-16 10:42:45 I just don't get it. Venezuela could be one of the richest countries in the world because if it's oil. citizens are suffering. 
The whole country, including police and military (who should protect and serve citizens) could rebel against politics, but they don't. Is it lethargy?

8612 2018-10-16 10:42:09 Everybody knows there was a dip in oil revenue globally. Go and read up on Venezuela the country became a failed state within 3 years.

8633 2018-10-16 10:38:07 I can speak from experience here. Chilli's by a long way. The comment about washing chilli oil off is not true, trust me! They are agony for ages 
8634 2018-10-16 10:38:04 If we had more billionaires like Musk (say what you want about his character, Tesla and SpaceX are extremely important, and wouldn't be much of a thing without him), and fewer oil sheiks, we'd be much better off already. Also more like Bill Gates.
8635 2018-10-16 10:38:01 It’s also complete nonsense, it suggests 16% of the UK are responsible for 58% of the deficit, largely because all North Sea oil and gas isn’t seen a Scottish export, nor is anything that goes through an English port (whisky, gin, livestock etc) This is basic.
8636 2018-10-16 10:37:56 Petrol prices are increasing in India even when global crude oil prices have fallen. PM Modi is taking money from people's pockets and filling the pockets of a handful of rich corporates: Congress President @RahulGandhi

8638 2018-10-16 10:37:51 The problem is that if we stop the production of palm oil, something potentially more destructive to the environment will have to take its place to satisfy our greedy consumer culture.

So really the problem isn't palm oil, but too many demanding people.

8642 2018-10-16 10:37:29 I don't care It will get us off of oil & Saudis know that it's what stopped the original opec power grabs they saw west moving to renewables & feared losing their cash cow
8643 2018-10-16 10:37:28 It's no secret that almost all Republicans oppose climate change mitigation policies, and the most loud at that are heavily oil/gas/coal-funded.
So if you're a scientist who's very concerned abt climate/think policy changes are urgent, wd you lean and vote political left? Hmmm.

8650 2018-10-16 10:36:35 There are problems with the RSPO. Look instead at the Palm Oil Innovation Group which has the requirement that palm oil must be free of deforestation & destruction of peat lands. The RSPO standard doesn’t do this.

8708 2018-10-16 10:31:05 Oct.15 (Dow Jones) -- U.S. oil exports to China have slowed to a trickle amid the trade spat between Washington and Beijing, in an abrupt reversal that is upending global crude trade flows and forcing American producers to find new buyers.

8716 2018-10-16 10:30:03 You didn't mention (in your article about the KSA threat to use oil as a political weapon) the fact that Turki also mentioned selling oil in yuan, i.e. dropping the USD. Which would kind of reveal that the petrodollar is already the biggest weapon of all

My favorite hair mask for moisturizing! 

- 1 tablespoon of mayonnaise 
- 1 tablespoon of olive oil /coconut oil 
- 1 tablespoon of honey 
- 1 egg white (the yolk of the egg tends to smell, lots of the nutrients are in the egg white as well so it works

8723 2018-10-16 10:28:58 Sir, but China is already, gradually, moving towards non-dollar transaction of oil. If India, which might be considerably big in a decade or two, also follow it, will America be able to do the same what it used to do earlier?
8724 2018-10-16 10:28:57 Who in their right minds would let their blood boil by watching a snake oil salesman who lied his way into the White House?

PS: What were the questions topics that Stahl couldn’t address?
8725 2018-10-16 10:28:49 I think they hv oil. i am not too sure though
8726 2018-10-16 10:28:23 Not boding well: 'He was an advocate for expansion of the British Empire, particularly in Africa and Asia, which supplied palm oil, a key ingredient in Lever's product line...'
8727 2018-10-16 10:28:08 So how about we regulate the huge corporations that corrupt the government and stop this stuff from happening, or did you forget, if oil becomes worthless so does our money.

8730 2018-10-16 10:28:02 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
8731 2018-10-16 10:28:00 That’s not going to happen. Russia produces mainly heavy oil, absolutely not a replacement for Saudi’s light sweet crude anyway.

Choice can provoke competition but there's now so much all it really provokes is confusion

8777 2018-10-16 10:20:57 Saudi will get away with this. They are the largest producers of oil, they have money and finance many western interests and businesses. The Saudis have been committing war crimes in Yemen but western powers have kept silent. When you have money, you can get away with many things
8778 2018-10-16 10:20:40 And whisky, and salmon. Don’t forget oil. Oh and water. Waters going to be pretty important in the future...
8779 2018-10-16 10:20:34 It's easy to loose allied countries; more difficult to find new ones (and oil american industry dépends on high prices :)
8780 2018-10-16 10:20:22 A bit! Thankfully working from home today, so could start the day with a soothing breathing rhythm, counting breaths with my essential oil diffuser on and a couple of yoga stretches. Upwards and onwards. Thank you for checking in!
8781 2018-10-16 10:20:17 While playing poker, Paul Ryan decides not to tell Melania that ACLU lawyers are sitting on vast reserves of oil. Benjamin Netanyahu dresses in drag.

8783 2018-10-16 10:19:58 True, but transportation depends on oil and that is irreplaceable. And that what I am worried about

8792 2018-10-16 10:18:40 Lol the best Jollof is cooked with firewood, i want that. 
Someone even gave me a trick in making jollof rice. Wash the rice with hot water, then fry it in oil with seasoning cubes in it. The rice won't be soggy after.
8793 2018-10-16 10:18:31 I love that even though the oil companies have admitted they influenced the public and now are finally starting see the effects on their bottom line, fools like you are still peddling their lies for them.

8803 2018-10-16 10:16:54 Buy Electric cars.  Move away from gas-burners.  Get off oil.  Saudi, journalist-killing oil.
8804 2018-10-16 10:16:47 Because the U.K. economy is not as reliant on oil and gas. Revenues from the financial sector dwarf its oil and gas receipts.
8805 2018-10-16 10:16:46 So basically he through Pompeo out .. wow... have never heard that before... we are truly being respected around the world. Chalk one up for Agent Orange.

Given this situation if Agent Orange dares to punish the Saudis for committing murder on foreign soil, oil will be over $150
8806 2018-10-16 10:16:36 And if we compare the low to high in both

#UKOG did 0.95-2.93 ~200%
#ANGS did 4.25-12 ~200%

Both the same

Same basin
Same oil
Same play

Commercial oil is good for both

Hold both

It sticks on ones hips after leaving a delicious taste on the lips.  
I do love Maltesers too  though but no more 

8821 2018-10-16 10:14:37 What you wrote is true if it was only oil that is sole source of revenue of the country. Add gas. Add petrochemical. Add taxes. Add fees. Add and add and add. Then let's not forget that if two wars stopped tomorrow that budget would drop too.
8822 2018-10-16 10:14:36 Well, then there was every President cowling down to SAUDIS...OIL..OIL..OIL...Remember 911 and BUSH..

8826 2018-10-16 10:13:44 We need to stay out of the Saudi business, they will disrupt  oil prices , thus gas prices go up. The only one who benefits from that is big oil and them
8827 2018-10-16 10:13:37 まぁ、184ばっかだよな
8828 2018-10-16 10:13:34 Add oil 
8829 2018-10-16 10:13:27 The chickens coming home to roost. Our addiction to oil built the House of Saud and somehow we are now shocked by their level of brutality coming to light. We only have ourselves to blame.
8830 2018-10-16 10:13:22 How is going to work out? Iran oil export is going to be limited soon Saudi needs to compensate the shortage it doesn't mean the price will go down.
8831 2018-10-16 10:12:47 BTW there are hundreds of oil lamps too in the temple premises.
8832 2018-10-16 10:12:42 There's just no need to ply crackers with palm oil, it's madness. We use natural ingredients and organic dairy in ours. You're right that it's a choice @ottaviaincucina
8833 2018-10-16 10:12:29 Not true - they have more than enough cash for them to cover this without selling their stake in #ukog. Including the £375k cash as part of the deal #prim
8834 2018-10-16 10:12:26 Or we just use natural gas instead until we have a less toxic form of atomic power that the public will be happy with. Plenty of time, no hurry. Always beware of salesmen telling you it's imperative you buy their snake oil NOW! #piginapoke
8835 2018-10-16 10:12:16 This is a convenient time for the international business community to drop Saudi Arabia and leave it to its own devices. Oil isn't the power it used to be and the Saudi's under MBS go from one blunder to the next.
8836 2018-10-16 10:12:11 Hua does not know that the oil stock did not extracted from the ground. There are strategic vital ports,
8837 2018-10-16 10:12:05 Lmaoo.. No, it's the oil concentration level...Perfumes are highly concentrated, colognes are less concentrated.

8850 2018-10-16 10:10:19 Trump - will do absolutly nothing with brutal killing by Saudi`s 

Oil and Arms Sales more important than People Values

CPI - FALLS UK
8851 2018-10-16 10:10:16 The palm oil industry isn't even benefiting the locals.  Indigenous people are thrown off their land and deprived of a means to sustain themselves and if they work on the palm oil estates the conditions and pay are poor.

8856 2018-10-16 10:09:43 Ein Problem dabei: der Großteil der Menschen hat natürlich kein Sensorium für die Quantitäten hat, um die es dabei geht. Wie auch viele Hausbesitzer glauben, mit 2 m2 PV am Dach seien sie energieautark und könnten beruhigt mit Strom heizen.

8859 2018-10-16 10:09:09 Can you imagine the orange oil slick that'd run off him . You'd have to call in the EPA hazmat team to clean up that orange toxic waste. Before it left everything it touched scorched n barren uninhabitable for all lifeforms.
8860 2018-10-16 10:09:07 There are actually two traded markets at work there. One is the oil price and the other is the fuel market. Quite separate apparently.

8867 2018-10-16 10:08:07 So there was a public auction of oil blocks yesterday. Facetious but a step in the right direction
8868 2018-10-16 10:08:05 Pam Ayres, she just won't use Palm oil,  
because the forests they despoil.  
replacing plants with just one sort,

8871 2018-10-16 10:07:41 Those returns in OBJ years were fire.....Those were the years when Banks were using Margin loans to pump dead companies like Afroil Oil, Metaverse Plc and First Aluminium coy 

stockbrokers made their kill then!
8872 2018-10-16 10:07:39 Is Pompeo meeting with Saudis and Turks to concoct a story for Trump so Saudis don’t retaliate with higher oil prices? How does Saudi explanation of, “interrogation gone wrong “ explain the non-return of the decapitated body of the reporter to his family some two weeks after?
8873 2018-10-16 10:07:28 He is another brexit oil salesman - a numpty who just talks but has not idea how to implement anything
8874 2018-10-16 10:07:22 Diesel prices have been hiked for 11 days in a row, despite a decline in the rates of crude oil. Rupee2.5  reduced and 2.5 increased govt. Is mocking with public once public starts mocking with govt. Then you all will become jokers in country
8875 2018-10-16 10:07:16 They will just use plausible deniability. The perps will be blamed and saudi might cut Turkeys oil bill for a while.
8876 2018-10-16 10:07:14 I've torn a muscle in my lower calf would this oil help or is it purely for aches and pains rather then significant injuries?

8878 2018-10-16 10:06:46 you get Newcastle for 300mill, a club with 50k supporters hungry for success, that is a steal nowadays. United will probably cost you 10-15 times more and it will not make you money for decades. The Saudis are looking at ways to make money after oil.
8879 2018-10-16 10:06:44 Oil is big reason in every world war (and Cold war). After imposing oil embargo on Japan, Japan retaliated by bombing Pearl harbor. 

But you had great analysis on how India can use the opportunity to counter Pakistan.

8888 2018-10-16 10:05:00 Maar daar geeft Ton geen antwoord op natuurlijk. Of hij komt zo met een nep grafiekje dat de olie in 20whenever opraakt wat net zulke onzin is als peak oil.
Maar wel toevallig dat wanneer blijkt dat de olie niet opraakt ze alweer een ander excuus hebben om de burger te pesten.
8889 2018-10-16 10:04:55 That could be the hook for our campaign to ban products with palm oil in them: "Don't eat Maltesers (or any product containing palm oil) as they are implicated in the onset of dementia!" :-) Cheers, Mike

9005 2018-10-16 09:48:50 Everyone who cares about this should campagn against all insecticides, buy/grow only organic produce, campaign against habitat destruction for (for example) palm oil plantations and campaign for large scale rewilding. And, most importantly, work to stop/slow climate breakdown.
9006 2018-10-16 09:48:32 Totally disagree, if the line falls it will trip, the transformer won't work, the oil is spilt. Ther are other alteria motives at play here

The arms deal that Trump is touting, part of it dates back to Obamas time.. and still hasnt gone anywhere.. its all fantasy
Oh and Bush 2 allowed the Saudis to fly out of America after 9/11... as it was THEIR nationals who flew the planes.. but hey, Iraq had oil
9020 2018-10-16 09:45:46 This Newsweek article is 100% true. Those are Trump's words. There is no such thing as clean coal, and there was never a "war" on coal. That's like saying there was once a war on whale oil, or peat.

9042 2018-10-16 09:43:28 Maybe. What we’ve done recently is parboil the potatoes first. You want them tender but not breaking apart at this point. Cool them down/dry them out. Then oil/salt and whack them in the ovenThey’re delicious.

9088 2018-10-16 09:38:20 Oil has traditionally been measured in 'barrels' (159 litres) and priced in US$
Will pricing/unit be rationalised in € per litre or at an international €-US$ exchange rate as per current pricing?
9089 2018-10-16 09:38:20 The point in the original post was what if Scotland voted yes in 2014. Scotland's net fiscal balance is £13.4bn (-7.9%) down from -8.9%. EU maximum is -3%. In 2016 with the collapse of oil prices Scotland would be miles away.

9170 2018-10-16 09:26:40 Sure, because there'd be a Trump Tower somewhere in Dusseldorf where world leaders met to sign bigly oil and arms deals.
9171 2018-10-16 09:26:39 But it can't sell any oil because of the USA sanctions, which is what precipitated this crisis.
9172 2018-10-16 09:26:37 Gas stations should indicate from where the crude oil it is.  This way we have a choice from whom to buy..
9173 2018-10-16 09:26:23 Hm, I guess this is a bad sign. If they had refrained pressure could be put on the oil refinery industry to fix the problem rather than the shippers. When one shipper surrenders others could be forced to too. Increased capex is not what they need. How do you interpret this Rongo?

9251 2018-10-16 09:15:01 I've never tasted Chick-fil-A but heard it was excellent however the CEO and LGBT groups are like oil and water;Popeye's is a Southern staple and known for their chicken and the biscuit is a plus;both Wendy's and McDonald's main focus is on delicious burgers.  Popeye's 4 the win!

9255 2018-10-16 09:14:53 The meeting you mentioned guaranteed American protection for Saudi oil assets. Prominence was only given after the fall of Shah of Iran.
9256 2018-10-16 09:14:53 I'm with you Pam. Do my best to check if palm oil unethically sourced in any food I use. I'd rather use one of the crappy vegetable oils.  I can choose. Orangutans can't.  
9257 2018-10-16 09:14:39 I'm no Hippy Dippy Dora but I feel if we can't get enough energy from the sun, the wind and hydro then we should look at our energy consumption.
There's so much talk about carbon footprints and so much blood spilled over oil, let's reduce our energy usage!
9258 2018-10-16 09:14:36 I don't think people crave sugar otherwise bowls of sugar would be consumed with spoons in 1sitting. Same with oil and butter. But mix the 2 together then you have an extreme enticement to gluttony.

9264 2018-10-16 09:13:36 when 100 oil and fuel companies cause 71% of climate change, we should focus our anger at them + capitalism, not at each other, and definitely not be uncompassionate & hateful to ill + poor people. although i agree individuals should adapt their lifestyle WHERE they can.

9280 2018-10-16 09:11:17 The fragility of the supply side of oil will probably put a rather hefty risk premium on the commodity.

9288 2018-10-16 09:10:38 Sorry but what a crock of shit. A comparative  assumption is like saying oil can’t be rated for its expected service life.
I acknowledge that it wouldn’t be easy. However I lean towards that reason for non public disclosure is a smart and risk adverse commercial decision.

9386 2018-10-16 08:55:04 better yet, keep the decommissioned oil rigs in the North sea, put them all there, drop in food once a week and leave them to it.  They can terrorise themselves.
9387 2018-10-16 08:54:55 Finally got my tea tree oil y’all and my scalp is so thankful 
9388 2018-10-16 08:54:55 Our Govt. Should not beg infront of anyone for reducing oil price,
Other than that should reduce taxes which is in their hands,
Stop fooling the  country people that you talking wth Saudi Govt.

Our common people knows everthing,
Do something good for country

9394 2018-10-16 08:53:40 you been overdosing on that CBD oil lad?

9396 2018-10-16 08:52:58 Looks great for palm. I never seem to be able to get that black shine with it. Have to use grapeseed oil instead.
9397 2018-10-16 08:52:55 
9398 2018-10-16 08:52:54 It's both amazing and terrifying how much day to day stuff has palm oil in.

9400 2018-10-16 08:52:36 @EON_SE_en do you sell and fit new oil boilers
9401 2018-10-16 08:52:31 Farmers are paid not to grow excess food but is there such a thing? Humans build oil pipelines the length of continents but won't build water pipelines for the desperate. It's time for outrage to enforce governments to save Third world countries.
9402 2018-10-16 08:52:06 I like Maltesers a lot, but someone on Twitter pointed out that they contain palm oil, so I am hoping to find an alternative I like as much. Palm oil cultivation is connected to the destruction of forests and everything that lives in them.
9403 2018-10-16 08:51:48 Isn't it 'dirty oil money?'
9404 2018-10-16 08:51:48 if you have problems with dandruff, dryness, build up etc. i recommend massaging warm almond or jojoba oil on your scalp, then wrap ur hair with hot damp towel & put a plastic cap over it for 10-15 min. afterwards wash ur hair.  i swear ur scalp will feel soooo clear & healthy!
9405 2018-10-16 08:51:45 Like bro, if i wanna smell like fresh coconut oil, imma smell like that.
9406 2018-10-16 08:51:32 A large proportion of palm oil expansion occurs at the expense of biodiversity and ecosystems in the countries it is produced. Deforestation for palm oil production also contributes significantly to climate change.  removal of native forests involves burning of invaluable timber

9422 2018-10-16 08:49:45 Everyone heard it
9423 2018-10-16 08:49:29 So. They attempted to get 'terrorist' attached to 'brown person' and get everyone worked up so they wouldn't throw fits about the murder for oil thing.
But then get upset when everyone starts attaching 'terrorist' to any (white) group with guns~
Then demands actions be taken.

What is the FMPR & NNPC doing with the 445,000 barrels of crude oil allocated to the refineries daily? If we fix our refineries & refine locally, do we still need 2 import fuel?
9450 2018-10-16 08:44:41 What was perceived to be the next catalyst to pump  $oil back to 100s has turned out --->short live!

Oil should continue its path back to 70 or lower.......ill be waiting

9457 2018-10-16 08:43:34 When has equating immaterial with material ever helped us improve our understanding of the world?

I think these “data=oil” narratives aren’t helping and should be avoided.

9530 2018-10-16 08:32:07 Fact 6 - It is estimated that a $10 per barrel Increase in the price of oil reduces growth by 0.2 - 0.3 percentage points, increases WPI #inflation by 1.7% and worsens CAD by $9-10 billion dollars.

9575 2018-10-16 08:27:39 Oil marketing companies are like Kaamdhenu for GOI. Lakhs of crores flowing from petrol pumps to Govt Treasury as taxes. Even pump owners are hugely benefited. Instead of taxing fuel govt must catch tax evaders which will compensate tax collection. No big achievement so far.
9576 2018-10-16 08:27:30 I dont know why people think Russia is so powerful that they can manipulate most powerful countries in the world. Its far more likely that companies are lobbying so they can have that sweet oil/gas money again.

9583 2018-10-16 08:26:46 We have had double digit inflation since 2016. With the attendant challenges of oil prices unpaid wages by state governments even despite bail out funds was not going to wipe it in 2 years.  Import based economies take time to realign. You of all people know that.
9584 2018-10-16 08:26:17 Brent has broken $80 , the new could be $75 - $80 till NOV 1st week. Good for equity equilibrium. Oil PSU should be back to their previous price levels.

9597 2018-10-16 08:23:51 One indomie super pack cooked without oil and garnishing contains about 400kcal of energy (about 2,000 times more than a plate of rice)
A 4km walk helps you burn about 200kcal.
What happens to the rest? It's stored as fat.
You wonder why people lose weight when they drop indomie?

9655 2018-10-16 08:15:11 Then they threatened to take the cost per barrel of oil to $200.00 if we retaliate somehow.  Pardon my ignorance, but what difference does it make if we're now the largest producer?
9656 2018-10-16 08:15:08 @guardian @guardiannews The Saudis know that they have massive control over the Western Economy. They currently control about 70-80% of the World's oil supplies. They also have massive financial wealth.. Does that mean we let them get away with murdering a writer?
9657 2018-10-16 08:14:49 OK I don't understand art, and I don't know why people dis people who say that. People like stuff I don't. There are livingroom oil portraits that to me look like framed linoleum patterns. So good for you Andy Thomas you're making something people want. Not me, but people.
9658 2018-10-16 08:14:43 Oil Prices rose on signs of falling Iran oil exports ahead of U.S. sanctions against Tehran in November, while geopolitical tensions remain over a missing Saudi journalist.

9663 2018-10-16 08:14:14 #efplondon Pharma started out as a chemical industry. Increasingly it is a patient driven one. Can we become a 'platform' industry with patients at the centre? Oil companies are now investing in wind power. Can we do the equivalent?

9668 2018-10-16 08:13:36 “British economist Peter Dixon, the US sanctions against Iran led to an increase in inflation in the UK, he said. So far, oil prices have increased by 10%, it will increase more and more.”
9669 2018-10-16 08:13:32 Sure, most companies belong to US hedgefonds with multi millionaire investors from all over the world, including Arab oil scheichs, African "presidents" etc.
9670 2018-10-16 08:13:32 Unless OPEC and US pump more oil and depress the prices below $50, Iran cant feel pain.
9671 2018-10-16 08:13:15 Gas from Scottish Oil & Gas fields... what will rUK do after Scotland becomes independent?  Suddenly have to start paying Scotland billions every year... but apparently it’s Scotland who’s financially dependent on England?  Really.

9686 2018-10-16 08:11:04 Just went to the US DoE website to look up details of a fuel cell project. Research page now has: "coal" "oil & gas" "on-site research" "energy analysis" with all 21st century clean energy now bundled under "non-fossil energy research".

9696 2018-10-16 08:10:07 Okay the source on BP making profits didn't mention their damages payments, they have however seen increased profits per gallon on oil due to price increases, but that's naturally occurring anyway due to the market~
9697 2018-10-16 08:09:51 Us too. Boring things like sugar, cooking oil and tinned tomatoes, plus essentials like breakfast tea and the Lavazza coffee that was on offer last week 
9698 2018-10-16 08:09:45 Not sure how you're doing it now but my guess is you need a bit more oil and a lot less heat. If it spits and bubbles its too hot.
9699 2018-10-16 08:09:43 @maduro_en  Maybe Norway can help you organise Venezuela's oil production. Then offer contracts to global airlines to supply them with fuel at set below the world market prices to bypass US sanctions.

9713 2018-10-16 08:07:16 that's only because US and UK were oil producers that needed to maintain oil as commodity, otherwise after such a stint all those countries would have gone the French way: alternative power sources.

9715 2018-10-16 08:06:42 Seriously, maybe you have a good relationship with Trump, but the  Trump voters hates Islam. Without your vast amounts of oil tomahawks would already be flying.
9716 2018-10-16 08:06:22 The technology has been there even if only in concept for the west to ween itself off oil, but you know how special interest groups and lobbyists prefer the status quo.

9718 2018-10-16 08:06:05 If Saudi Arabia follows thru with threatened price hikes in response to being held to account for #khashoggi's murder, the Brent Oil index price will double from US$80 in the blink of an eye. We need to keep our focus on quickly providing cheaper forms of electric transport.
9719 2018-10-16 08:05:49 Fitted to a ship at the Tema fishing harbour is a 470 megawatts (MW) power plant that needs at least 30,000   tonnes of oil every month.

9723 2018-10-16 08:04:36 Can't say it will resolve this. They are a rogue kingdom created by Wahhabi religious & political movement that rejected Ottomans claims to be 'protectors' of 'authentic' Islam. Then run by the Saud family surrounded by the Brit's later with oil exploration in US hands NOW?

It will favour the two parties.
1. Nigerians

2. People that don't want light to be permanent in Nigeria. (Owners of Mikano, Elepaq, oil companies, politicians).

Subsidise renewable energy. GBAM.

9732 2018-10-16 08:03:14 Oil price volatility is not the problem Oil prices are a random walk with downward drift ( as oil is replaced by fossils) the major demand for oil does not come from energy but from fertilisers transport civil aviation Of these railways are already largely and increasingly 1/2

9753 2018-10-16 08:00:09 Why Tesla?
car has no engine, no transmission, no spark plugs, fan belts, air filters, timing belts, or cylinder heads. It never needs oil changes, tuneups, or emissions checks. Your brake pads go years without needing replacement.
Horse dealers said cars wouldn’t work either.

9770 2018-10-16 07:58:31 Under President Buhari, who doubles as the Oil Minister, Nigeria is bearing what's nearing the highest fuel subsidy bill in our history without going through a budgeting process and appropriation by the National Assembly. 

1. It is illegal
2. It is corrupt.
9771 2018-10-16 07:58:30 But important not to let the appeasement camp and snake oil salesmen divert people on another false trail by letting them spin the argument that an EEA should be the destination. A less bad end game is not a solution. #EndTheChaos
9772 2018-10-16 07:58:21 It must be dawning on the snake oil salesmen that they sold Snake Oil+++++++The vision they sold has been internalised so profoundly NO compromise will be countenanced,hence the impasse.

9781 2018-10-16 07:57:21 You need to  understand the mathematics and statistics behind crude oil pricing in international market. 
Also, law of demand and supply in economics. 

Today price of a barrel of Brent crude is $81 (remember we sell our crude raw), 2015 price was average $35. Do this math?
9782 2018-10-16 07:57:06 Corbyn still peddling "a CU".  There is only "the CU".  As much a fantasist as any Tory cake and eat it snake oil salesman.

9794 2018-10-16 07:55:37 Fact: Saudi Arabia has been providing  free oil to Jordan since 2011, the kinglet sells it to Jordanian consumers at almost $150 a barrel
9795 2018-10-16 07:55:37 There r lots of inconsistencies in retweeting this article & in article itself:
1)about Russia,Turkey supposedly "helping" Iran to avoid sanctions by channeling Iranian oil to "Caspian Sea oil refineries" 
2)Russia doesn't hv any significant oil refineries in Caspian Sea/nearby

9802 2018-10-16 07:54:45 So accidentally torturing someone to death makes the act all OK does it Saudi Arabia? Roll on the day we no longer need to buy their shitty oil and they disappear back into a desert sandstorm of nothingness!

9804 2018-10-16 07:54:13 Joseph stop dreaming. Oil is still the sole revenue generator for Nigeria. Eg: Buhari is building a refinery in Katsina. Why didn't he build a rice farm and mill. If you were a foreigner would you invest in Nigeria or Rwanda?
9805 2018-10-16 07:54:09 The video, with edited sound, showed only the governor, some parts of a room or office and hand of a ‘giver’. That is not enough to prove that he was collecting a kickback from a contractor.

9820 2018-10-16 07:52:32 Is it any wonder people go to illegal lengths to obtain THC/CBD products? A gram of weed can cost as little as £10. Obviously this contains both THC & CBD, in various strengths. In the UK, you can buy CBD oil only, upto £50 for a pathetic 5% CBD. Piss take. #Legalize

Ofe mmanu refers to Yorubas having a lot of oil in their soup. It's also clearly derogatory independent of context. Aboki is different in my opinion

9835 2018-10-16 07:50:39 Carbon sequestration in old oil and gas reservoirs is expensive, but perfectly feasible. Capturing the CO2 from fossil fuel burning limits emissions, but applying the technique to biofuel fuel burning removes CO2 from the atmosphere.
9836 2018-10-16 07:50:35 Essential Oils: Many Essential Oils are too potent to be used on their own and some even vaporize on exposure to the air. Hence, it’s common to dilute them in a base oil called a carrier oil. This gives you the dual benefits of both oils and reduce valuable Essential Oils.

9894 2018-10-16 07:42:45 It is a matter of time before oil starts trading higher again. There is no way the world with near zero spare capacity and 4.5pct annual depletion can keep up with rising demand.

9988 2018-10-16 07:28:07 The Prime Fleecers action on petrol prices is a classic case study.

The fact her Govt tanked the currency didn't help.

9997 2018-10-16 07:26:50 True! Even if you have oily skin, you still have to hydrate. Oily does not mean hydrated, it means that your skin is overcompensating! You can cut the oil by buying a moisturizer that fights excessive oil production.
