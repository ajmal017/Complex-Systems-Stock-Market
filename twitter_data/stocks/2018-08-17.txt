267 2018-08-19 18:51:49 How is it that the anger wasn’t recognized? Many lost life savings, retirement accounts based on stocks were gone in a flash. Countless stories of financial destruction all due to loose banking laws. Trump is leaving us vulnerable again. Stripping laws meant to protect us.

385 2018-08-19 16:46:14 Record black unemployment. Record stocks and 401ks.  Record median wages.  Got any stats that prove otherwise?
386 2018-08-19 16:44:36 Well, at least according to, if I remember correctly, libel laws.  But, that doesn't seem to pertain--unless like Microsoft (it has been maintained), many public platforms are actually held by government composite stocks..   Then--we have a horse of a different color.

389 2018-08-19 16:40:45 That's a series of untruths the person uttered. Anbodu Kochi says stocks are fast depleting. And even those with Cash in banks are in camps, wearing donated clothes. Such clips make the task of those raising funds so difficult
390 2018-08-19 16:40:14 1 quick back-of-napkin example.

official inflation rate in usa is ~2.5%.

total us personal income is over $16t.

$16t * .025 = $400b that could be helping those at bottom, but instead vanishes into inflating assets of the rich (stocks, real estate, etc).

392 2018-08-19 16:38:09 IBM is an interestng stock with strong fundamentals. In the last years performance was soft, but mabye it is time for a sector-change away from the overprized Facebooks

What´s your opinion on oil stocks like Exxon, Shell, Total, BP etc. ?  Dividends are very good in that segment
393 2018-08-19 16:34:51 We just played a crew battle with 6 people 3 in each team. I played jiggly and got 9 stocks
394 2018-08-19 16:34:31 Some are investors that sometimes whish they were traders . Some are traders that whish they were investors.  Hold stocks for a long time and make good money . Hold them to long to see those gaines turn to a loss . Maybe have to be a little of both . 2018 was a learning point
395 2018-08-19 16:33:24 @GoodNewsBull stocks were made to go up, people don’t grasp that concept, yes dips happen but it’s just cheaper options/shares!
396 2018-08-19 16:32:28 いけるかぁー？
397 2018-08-19 16:29:55 It's all about consistency in the narrative, is it not? Which makes one wonder how many other consistently maintained narratives warrant questioning! As, for example, all the other "tech" stocks, the "value" of which is built on investor fantasies, and not economic reality.
398 2018-08-19 16:29:10 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo
399 2018-08-19 16:28:54 That's funny, considering I bought a house at the beginning of the recession and sold it for over $100,000 profit. That was during his time as president. My stocks also did well. Not so much under trump.
400 2018-08-19 16:28:39 I WON THE LOTTERY!!! Bought a brand new house, a new car, opened up a personal business, invested in some stocks, and booked my flight to begin traveling the world with my little family. This didn’t really happen, I’m just speaking it into existence
401 2018-08-19 16:28:25 I use my own stocks sometimes well most of the times and own cc
402 2018-08-19 16:28:19 Yeah. It’s good idea really but sometimes stocks movements are extremely volatile n hence your hedges can be blown away.  Also if u write calls for this purpose then that much portion of margin money is blocked regularly, that may hamper your performance in ur derivative trades.
403 2018-08-19 16:27:07 I don’t use Facisist Book anymore for this reason. I sold my FB stocks too.
404 2018-08-19 16:26:08 Instead of risking your hard earned money betting, start small and invest in stocks consistently, putting cash every month as you grow your investment.

410 2018-08-19 16:24:03 Yup . Fundamentals are strong if they execute.  But almost everything  got hammered this year .  My problem is I am a investor not a trader  .

411 2018-08-19 16:23:00 they did some analysis on the cuts - many businesses used those monies for buy backs of their stocks - very little went to workers - why did they not give their workers the stocks that they bought - how about that idea -give stocks to the workers instead of a one time cash deal??

430 2018-08-19 16:07:42 Not sure how an investment into Global Canna Labs, Little Green Pharma, AAA Tricho-Med and Evolution Bnk is what you consider a scam. They backed out of Africa and because of that and the drop by “pretty much all pot stocks” you may as well say 99% of pot stocks are scams then.
431 2018-08-19 16:07:30 The crash of the stock market in 1929 was much like the housing market in 2007. People were buying stocks on margin, without the cash to back their purchases. They were living beyond their means. At some point in time, that comes back to bite you on the butt.

443 2018-08-19 16:00:25 Depends on. I buy them only on strong volume, don't go crazy with size and avoid low priced #stocks (<$10). More important for me is intraday liquidity. I strongly avoid stocks which are only traded at the open.

464 2018-08-19 15:44:03 I honestly like it because it shifts the mindset of corporations to invest long term rather than shorterm. On the stock investing side, it will force investors to bolster their longterm views on the stocks to make their investment thesis work.

472 2018-08-19 15:36:55 As old forms fall out of favor, new ones are generated.  Uses also change, as where the functional role of stocks and bonds has reversed itself in the past sixty years.  New forms are borrowed from other cultures; witness the fairly recent “bankable corporate payable” from Japan.

485 2018-08-19 15:26:32 Good discussion, guys eating breakfast
486 2018-08-19 15:26:24 But what's funny about it is Facebook's attempt to be a hero and pretend like Russia was meddling just to get its stocks up. That's the story no news Outlet talks about
487 2018-08-19 15:25:20 not sure what this is in response to
488 2018-08-19 15:24:52 I just did a poll and 100% of people asked wanted to remain and for Farage to be put in stocks and pelted with rotten fruit.
489 2018-08-19 15:24:32 Thank you for recognizing that fact, especially considering there’s 51% of us in this country. Or said in the terms of Wall Street- we hold the controlling percentage of stocks.  we are grossly underrepresented
490 2018-08-19 15:23:25 No that’s your stance. You’re not taking into factors like pitcher fatigue or your current lineup, sample size of the hitter.  Move the line and simplify. Get the run home. Percentages are 33% getting on base. Next guy up % of xtrabase hit is less than 20%.
491 2018-08-19 15:23:21 this is actually a credit to Jon's way of thinking though: The game has adapted to not valuing SB, and as a result pitchers holding the runners on and catcher arms are devalued. As such, the probability of getting caught gets lower all else equal. Making the attempt more valuable
492 2018-08-19 15:22:19 Still ill-equipped for peopling. Patience reserves low. Must ration remaining stocks for the Boss. Please do not deplete.
493 2018-08-19 15:22:11 Like I said earlier, you have 27 outs in a game and they’re all valuable. The harm of getting caught stealing far outweighs the gain of a successful stolen base
494 2018-08-19 15:21:46 And as a concession to Jon: who is pitching and hitting affects this probability. But often "productive" outs are negative.
495 2018-08-19 15:21:38 Hi Tom, I think I slightly misread  Comité de Champagne’s bulletin yesterday 18 Aug of the opening dates of the 2018 harvest village by village. The Aubois are, no surprise, first out of the stocks : Buxeuil and Polisy  tomorrow 20 Aug;
Avirey-Linge 21 Aug; Montgueux 22 Aug.
496 2018-08-19 15:21:34 Have you ever seen a poor bookie they specialise in taking money from punters, it's called making a market, they change the odds like stocks and shares to generate bets
497 2018-08-19 15:21:20 Define long term. His chart in front of you proves gold beats stocks since 2001.

I can support any argument if you let me pick my beginning and ending points. Give me data points of 11:00 pm and 4:00 am, and I can prove the sun never rises.
498 2018-08-19 15:21:03 Further ironies: Left handed "swing for the fences" types ground out to 2B more than anyone
Also: in terms of "manufacturing a run": All for the bunt single, stealing second and that guy scoring. The Angels do this wonderfully. I'm just against giving up an out 90-95% of the time
499 2018-08-19 15:19:44 What’s even worse is, it was bought by Roark Capital who’s a private company and has no stocks to buy.
Between this and bw3 all the good food stuffs are private now. 
500 2018-08-19 15:19:26 drops to 0.644. The “productive” out just cost the team 0.187 runs
501 2018-08-19 15:19:04 im not blanket against situational hitting but what you said is actually a good example of the logic against productive outs. Esp if you are losing. Outs are scarce! Burning an out with a grounder to 2B likely reduces your chances to win
502 2018-08-19 15:18:52 Exactly. Let’s look at a classic “productive out” situation. Runner on first with 0 out. The batter sacrifices him over to second. You think it’d result in more runs right? With a runner on 1st and no outs, expected runs is 0.831. With a runner on second and 1 out, expected runs
503 2018-08-19 15:17:40 Not saying top priority but in the 8th inning you have 6 outs left.....not 27 and if you don’t have the skill set to manufacture a run.....then you’re swinging for the fences vs advanced bullpens
504 2018-08-19 15:16:14 Found out today that my dad invested 5,000 dollars in marijuana stocks but still won’t give me money to get a cheesey Gordita crunch
505 2018-08-19 15:16:09 that there are things that are difficult to quantify is something im happy to grant that (I used to do this for the Yankees and might go back into the game soon). But trying to get "productive outs" just shouldnt be a top priority. It is valuable, but just not as much
506 2018-08-19 15:15:46 A private company isn't social media groups that sale shares and stocks.
507 2018-08-19 15:14:47 Yes and you get on base by hitting vs the shift....which they don’t. If you can hit the other way, productive outs become more relevant in the game. You want to make it math & baseball people will tell you it’s just not math. You can’t quantify all the variables involved
508 2018-08-19 15:14:17  

Love and marriage are dangerous items in the market with respect to stocks. With respect to strategy , it is a different matter
509 2018-08-19 15:14:14 if swinging for the fences yields you the best outcomes, swing for the fences. Kind of ironic that this is your position when that approach yields significantly more sac flies
510 2018-08-19 15:14:02 Thank you. I didn’t want to bring in any more “advanced” statistics, even though I love them, because earlier someone was seeing even OBP as an “advanced” stat that doesn’t belong near the game. But seriously, thank you.

These 3 stocks need to be watched very closely.
514 2018-08-19 15:12:39 the point of wOBA is to weight singles proportionally based on how many more runs the team is expected to score as a result of that single v. a HR. It values the HR as ~ 2.2 times more valuable.
515 2018-08-19 15:12:39 When did swinging for the fences come in to play? This conversation literally started off as BA vs OBP and why OBP is a better indicator of a player’s value
516 2018-08-19 15:11:54 Getting "productive outs" isnt as much of a talent or a productive activity than getting a double or home run. There are some guys who add a bit more value that way, (and someone mentioned hitting against the shift more which would be reflecetd in OBP and SLG) but not many.
517 2018-08-19 15:11:39 I like surfing & stocks I’m a simple guy !
518 2018-08-19 15:10:56 One downside of ecommerce is that a lot of things that would be available in shops easily, no longer is. For eg I wanted to donate water purifier pills to kerala through a volunteer. Not a single medical store in bangalore stocks them. Amazon will take 4 days to deliver
519 2018-08-19 15:10:38 Bat yung iba ayaw nila ipadeliver ung stocks nila pag hndi ako maghahatid anong meron? Hahahahha
520 2018-08-19 15:10:11 the reason sabermetricians like to use OBP in lieu of R and RBI is that the player is responsible for getting himself on base, and while over baseball history there have truly been a couple of "clutch hitters", people do not consistently get R/RBI independent of OBP and SLG
521 2018-08-19 15:08:21 He probably said this right after shorting a bunch of stocks in the healthcare sector.
522 2018-08-19 15:08:14 We cannot afford to be laughing stocks of other teams fans to date Pirates lost 6 points in a row
523 2018-08-19 15:07:41 Just so YOU grasp the point being made, the permanent 40% corporate tax cut was promoted by Trump as a boost to the economy and workers' wages. Unless you have a HUGE 401k your benefit from the buy-backs will be fucking tiny. And stocks do NOT always remain high.

I'm currently reading Common Stocks and Uncommon profits-Phil Fisher

527 2018-08-19 15:02:56 Michael is a giant wuss who has no life so he just spouts numbers like a mental defect. This is why they love Trump. Crazy stocks with crazy.
528 2018-08-19 15:02:29 Yes and what you do after matters. Swinging for fences is why you lose
529 2018-08-19 15:00:58 There are characteristics that have been proven over long periods to be associated with above-average rates of return: low P/Es, discounts to book value, low debt/equity ratios, stocks with recent significant price declines, companies with [insider buying] -- Will Browne
530 2018-08-19 15:00:25 Getting on base helps your team win. You have 27 outs in a game and they’re all valuable. Assuming both get 750 PA over a full season, a person with a .400 OBP will reach base 300 times, compared to the 263 times someone with a .350 OBP will. That’s 37 more opportunities to score

538 2018-08-19 14:55:00 I’d rather have my team do what’s necessary to win.  I don’t fault the player playing for their next contract.  Problem is younger levels never make kids learn to use the entire field. Not about BA’s or OBP or OBPS+...its about scoring runs and winning games

Using your smart phone to trade or invest in stocks & shares bypasses white economic gatekeepers who can restrict your income options.

Setting up an online e business enables this too.

652 2018-08-19 12:44:12 You’re welcome! I count Thursday’s red candle with huge volume as a sign of strong resistance at the $7.80 because it’s made a LOWER high, dumped on large volume & overall short sentiment indicative of lower prices coming up. No buy OR short now. Avoid stocks mid-range. #Watching

656 2018-08-19 12:37:37 One can't lose their money unless they sell. But you wouldn't know anything about that as all you do is short. On that note, I recommend you definitely keep shorting #lithium stocks, so I can laugh when you get squeezed into oblivion in the next few months.  P.s. Elon says hi!

664 2018-08-19 12:25:48 Sad that Washington has to go after the best thing America has had in many years. Jobs and stocks is up. Everyboby is profiting except the Crooked Politions in Washington.

666 2018-08-19 12:24:32 They’re already mainstream  we are just in a  market.  Common stocks rise 75 % of the time and bull markets can last for several years.  markets in stocks last about a year. So the  market is probably over in crypto or will be soon!
667 2018-08-19 12:24:04 I’d class budget as drug store brands - Boots stocks mid-high range too - more the L’Oréal/Maybellines etc and the drugstore own brands like Collection 2000 etc

670 2018-08-19 12:22:11 So did you use the historical data to come up with like a multiple linear regression model that you use to plug in the early volume data for new stocks which then spits out a forecast?

705 2018-08-19 11:28:14 What do you do? Just trade smaller cap/low priced stocks (which is how I started following you), or do you invest longer term?

708 2018-08-19 11:26:03 Top 4 stocks to watch for the week: $ACCO, $HDB, $WU, $X, all may climb w/in 14, 7, 7, 21 days up to 4.8%, 2.2%, 1%, 5.1% respectively 
709 2018-08-19 11:25:27 And I’m betting he shorts those stocks just before announcing “the rigged Dems drove up the cost of our plans to defend Earth from aliens. So sad Martian Maxine Waters wants monsters popping out of your chests. I’m canceling Space Force for now. We’ll try again in 2021.”
710 2018-08-19 11:24:59 When asus started open sale for max pro m1 ,xiaomi also started open sale for note 5 pro. Why this happens, does flash sales are marketing technique for xiaomi. Mi fans always ask for stocks you ignored. Also increased price for products in the name of stocks. What's your thought
711 2018-08-19 11:23:46 Restocking was slow and I saw people at office saying they cudnt find rice to buy and has to stand long queues at distant shops to get. There's different routes for d new stocks to arrive from other states and if local people rushed for their own need,it will create another panic
712 2018-08-19 11:22:06 How did Congress win till 1970? They had a leader - Kamaraj. Current crop of BJP in TN are motor  mouths and laughing stocks. So they need a face who can talk to people, plenty of area to fish 1/2
713 2018-08-19 11:19:57 Current Global Security Market Cap is estimated by $65 trillion Stocks plus $100 trillion Bonds. We can see the enormous scale as well as the potential of Bonds Market today.

724 2018-08-19 11:02:04 For past 2 years IFGs open to all local fishers & decisions are democratically, proposals then go to Scot Gov & are considered on the basis of science (stocks & envir) & socio-economics. Proposals can take a little while to progress because they make every effort to do it right.
725 2018-08-19 11:01:18 yes, WEEKLY would very great!, thank you (crypto/gold/stocks etc)
726 2018-08-19 11:00:16 Discipline investing without any greed and fear is key for compounding returns 

Long term investing is always bullish nature = Buy on dips 

Only one strategy = Entry strategy 

Exit - Never an exit if it's index based Nifty Bees, however varies in case of stocks

728 2018-08-19 10:59:09 Never a good idea to post your portfolio on Twitter. I've known friends who bragged about the same thing about stocks in 2007. Then 2008 came along. But don't worry...  #crypto is much more unpredictable.

737 2018-08-19 10:53:23 I doubt Michele wolf being canceled is why the stocks are tanking I suspect it was well on its way before that and the cancellation just didn’t save it.

747 2018-08-19 10:45:46 But if fund is not matching returns of underlying index then it’s better to dump that fund. Also if one has surplus money for 10-10 years then it is best to put the same in large and quality stock rather than a fund... 10 year SIP in such stocks much better than sip in funds.
748 2018-08-19 10:44:54 @AYEVERB Yo bro, i honestly followed you from the beginning. I was disappointed when your stocks fell. I kept wanting the old been back. I am glad to hear you won against  mook. From South Africa
749 2018-08-19 10:43:41 Yes that is the downside of what I am trying to do
750 2018-08-19 10:42:40 i guess the only threat is China production capacity coming back on stream .. that threat is always a hanging sword on these stocks .. we have seen that play out on speculation .. straight from upper ckt to lower ckt .. still good for trading bets

754 2018-08-19 10:29:58 Drumpf and his cohorts KNOW "trickle down" economics doesn't work. But it made those at the top a whole lot richer. Those with companies, those with stock portfolios. The common man doesn't own stocks. They may have saving accounts but interest rates are low.

768 2018-08-19 10:12:35 I think the whole point is to create a public asset and re-invest the revenue as capital investment. The Government currently borrows money and it ends up in over-inflated asset bubbles like stocks and the housing market which benefits the 1% and no benefit to the public

923 2018-08-19 06:09:40 You could give Elon musk an edible and Tesla would just drop in stocks, he would be at a hospital just losing his shit over nothing lol
924 2018-08-19 06:08:57 In 1969 inflation was 2.9%.
Today it is 2.9%

Wages are still stagnant and costs of healthcare, housing and education continue to skyrocket

The GOP gave a $1.5 trillion dollar taxpayer handout to the wealthiest few people and corporations so they can buy back their own stocks
925 2018-08-19 06:08:03 We could do with those gas holders, though, Liam. Where are they going to store #brexit-related intervention stocks of Cheddar cheese?
926 2018-08-19 06:03:03 Let’s keep the stocks on a roll and keep going up for us  senior retired people and also the younger generation that have IRA with companies. Make America great again..
927 2018-08-19 05:59:32 Martin’s stocks are rising haha, hope we can hang onto him long term. The comparisons to Haz/Halligan are premature but he’s been great - conversions have made a big difference!
928 2018-08-19 05:59:04 Waiting for my #stocks to gain and stocks I want to lower so I can buy them. #stocklife #bullish. #markets.

Where do you go to get information on stocks?
933 2018-08-19 05:51:05 Netflix turned into a liberal craphole and are going down fast. Stocks dropped $80 a share last week. Susan Rice sucks in the private sector too
934 2018-08-19 05:50:08 Exchanges and their stocks will plummet! If it turns true .... Hope they file a writ petition and prolong ... !
935 2018-08-19 05:49:29 So @LouisFarrakhan, @kathygriffin @AntifaUSA is fine but an odd radio show host isn't? Hope all republicans, libertarians, independents  sell off their stocks asap!
936 2018-08-19 05:47:00 Kevin spacey's billionaire boys club earned just $126.00 opening day

Netflix stocks tanking while Michelle wolf's show is terminated

937 2018-08-19 05:44:47 Follow money. Want 2 know if he gets 2 have stock n their companies?? Fla GOP Governor blocked railway between 2 major cities when Feds  tried to set it up but now private enterprise is doing it & FLA Gov & wife own huge amt of stocks. Imagine that?  Fl needs to kick his ass out.
938 2018-08-19 05:42:32 I'm thinking management and show executives are behind this. I'm blown away how oblivious they are to this. Between this and sister network CNBC & nonstop cheering of stocks & bonds I can't take them seriously anymore. For me if I need biz news it's Bloomberg.
939 2018-08-19 05:39:20 Dear Amit please share your views on future group stocks... Same analysis like done in Alpha stock 20 20...please..

949 2018-08-19 05:23:44 Jeepers! I wonder if Donald has any investment plans in those companies?? Along with his private school stocks (minus laws monitoring the private school student outcomes, of course!) FUCK ME AGNES!!!!
950 2018-08-19 05:23:38 Jamey this is garbage. You don’t have round numbers and your crew must’ve been a bottle of tequila deep (each). Once again proving that fantasy “experts” are like monkeys picking stocks

954 2018-08-19 05:17:18 I got in at 75 last year with great difficulty as the volumes are very low. Exited at 90, again with great difficulty. Better to avoid such illiquid stocks.
955 2018-08-19 05:16:49 Hi Erin, our online store stocks the same sizes as our physical stores, plus a number of additional sizes depending on the product in question.
956 2018-08-19 05:16:35 Exactly!I hate it when ppl look at their own religion in a skewed way.What's the point of Qurbani if u don't understand the essence of it is charity unless you're one of those who stocks up all the meat to be eaten all year round by urself & end up giving only offals in charity.
957 2018-08-19 05:14:40 Major shocks to the global art market today, with collectors suddenly keen to liquidate their stocks of ASCII art, some many decades old, after it was discovered each popular social media site uses an unreliably different non-monospaced font, varying even from mobile to desktop.

962 2018-08-19 05:09:12 Why would you wanna leave mini stocks bruh?!
963 2018-08-19 05:07:48 They’re not greedy. They won the luck of the draw. Greedy are the speculators trading land, developers, city hall, the foreign buyers who just trade houses like stocks, etc. This tax is putting citizen vs. citizen. I don’t feel bad for em, but it’s bad policy and unhelpful
964 2018-08-19 05:07:12 Striaght oppressed bruh. Very few of us Lawton folk never even make it out of mini stocks
965 2018-08-19 05:04:53 Especially when the church owns stocks in big pharma that also opposes legalized marijuana
966 2018-08-19 05:04:10 KMJ What do you hate? Strong Economy, Jobs, Record High Stocks, IRAs up, record employment, Stopping Illegals from around the world coming thru Mexico, Hostages Released, remains sent home, 65 yr old war ended, Strong Military, Tough on Crime, $1 yr Presidential pay, Lower Taxes?

#Traders often buy or sell a stock & it shows them good profit, but they are “hoggish,” expect more, hold on & hope and let it run into a loss, which is very poor business,& #trader who follows it will not succeed in the end.

971 2018-08-19 04:51:14 Just think for a second, the Republican GOP won't create a true sound affordable healthcare system for all of Americans? Why? Many of them own Healthcare and Pharmisutical stocks? Conflicts of interest? And imagine all of our politicians recieve government federal healthcare?
972 2018-08-19 04:50:30 Too many people out there bragging about their multibagger stock-picks and claiming to having a teachable strategy for selecting such stocks. For a price, of course.

You CANNOT pick multibaggers. Period.
973 2018-08-19 04:50:05 Nope, holding my tech stocks. $DATA, $CRM $NTNX $MAFT, $SQ. Going to add more $GOOGL this week. Google cloud will outpace everything, mark my words!
974 2018-08-19 04:49:57 I guess he means cash? Because if you hold gold/stocks/real estate they appreciate along with inflation.
975 2018-08-19 04:49:33  non je n'ai pas cet article dans mes stocks ! Bonjour Dom 
976 2018-08-19 04:48:35 Ron Merkel articulating the 'pure' non-discrimination pov - so clear. 
Doesn't quite capture the brilliance of the book, which opens in 1894 with an SDA bricklayer about to be put in stocks (!) in front of Glebe local court - for sabbath breaking!
977 2018-08-19 04:48:28 行きましょう
978 2018-08-19 04:47:39 I kind of like how my business is more busy than I ever recall, improving house value, improving stocks, record low unemployment, Fox Conn on the way, and overall a great America improving daily.....I guess you miss that 08-16 epic America huh?
979 2018-08-19 04:45:45 Despite the NES Classic and Switch selling like crazy Nintendo still can't seem to catch a break. They're down from $57 in March to only $40 now. Yikes, Nintendo needs some help. 

That online service shit ain't driving any stocks up neither, it's only $20 so it ain't important.

SMH, stocks crashed too!!
989 2018-08-19 04:30:16 True. In a 10 year bull market many individual stocks will have amazing momentum for 3 to 4 years!! 
Example - bajaj finance from 1400 to 2800 where @rachitpjain caught most of it from 1900 onwards i think..
990 2018-08-19 04:29:27 Yet men establish and did not stoned; but it surpassed my townsmen, whose stocks fair to telegraph from too fast.

992 2018-08-19 04:24:32 You don't sleep well when you have stocks at 100+ and 300+ PE no matter how well the business is doing or how good the room for growth is. And when one thinks of unwinding from these positions the knees freeze up.

p.s. some of us are having insomnia 
993 2018-08-19 04:22:06 I still believe we will ship every bale we can come end of 18-19 marketing year as world stocks go down in and outside of China.
994 2018-08-19 04:21:37 Smart theory! Could very well be the reason lol... how crazy would it be if he invested in bueno nacho stocks and then bought it lol! Or maybe he just got rid of the original CEO lol
995 2018-08-19 04:20:30 Oprah is a kitsune who trades stocks for a living.
996 2018-08-19 04:19:53 Good question. Maybe he invested in stocks and maybe enough money to invest in Bueno Nacho and then made enough to buy the entire company.
997 2018-08-19 04:18:18 Not many making happier than calling my step dad who never thought I was gonna make anything of myself and telling him about my stocks and work and shit. The level of respect I feel from his voice is truly heartwarming.
998 2018-08-19 04:17:50 Unless southeast crop gets better to offset 600,000 bales that will be cut out here the upland crop will be 17.8ish.  If India does indeed have 2-3 million less and world Stocks fall to 75 million market will return back to highs in spring.
999 2018-08-19 04:16:19 Si estás en #Venezuela lo mejor que puedes hacer es:

1. Ir corto en divisas.
2. Invertir en bienes raíces.
3. Mantener posiciones en bonos de deuda.
4. No liquidar stocks.

6. Postergar contrataciones

1005 2018-08-19 04:06:49 To invest intelligently in securities one should be forearmed with an adequate knowledge of how the various types of bonds and stocks have actually behaved under varying conditions—some of which, at least, one is likely to meet again in one’s own experience.
1006 2018-08-19 04:02:10 So who wants to teach me how to get into stocks??
1007 2018-08-19 04:00:58 Heard our @CMofKarnataka say on tv that there is adequate stocks of food items & clothes. Those wanting to lend a helping hand can send money to be used for the rebuilding process once the rains stop.

1009 2018-08-19 03:55:59 Street Stocks Heat Races
1010 2018-08-19 03:55:56 But SPY call/put ratio has nothing to do with rest of the 500 stocks call/put. These are individual bets based on speculation. This is what I think, may be wrong though.
1011 2018-08-19 03:54:56 For a president to speak wrong oftop CIA agent is outrageous; Obama hated Americans including Americans from Africa heritages; Trump has his own hate for all Mexican Territory real owners of all the states the government stocks itself with!

1013 2018-08-19 03:52:09 I love the bet (responsibly sized). There's something unique about $TSLA among nearly-bankrupt stocks - most longs don't really believe it's possible. And we know the company has come within days of BK without anyone knowing at the time. It could happen out of the blue.
1014 2018-08-19 03:50:31 i wonder kung tumataas pa ba stocks nila hahahaha kahit mga commercial sa gma artista ng abs cbn eh 
1015 2018-08-19 03:50:03 私たちの株式投資への意欲をなくさせるような要因がかなりある。
There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks. (131)
1016 2018-08-19 03:48:21 No; I just watch their stocks scrawl back to the flat-line every day. 
They are going down as soon as we gain a solid majority in congress.
We win this one and we don't need them anymore.
The timing makes motive obvious.

1017 2018-08-19 03:46:12 I really luv these cats sayin that indexes are much higher but don’t trade individual stocks.
1018 2018-08-19 03:45:17 I’m using high/low/open/close data in my bitcoin only model (basically market direction), but not in the coin selection. This may be more info than what you want but cross sectionally (across all stocks at a particular time) high/low/close/open doesn’t seem to be as relevant
1019 2018-08-19 03:44:23 @JamesGRickards would you be so kind to give an opinion on cannabis stocks, as a long position? GTI(Amherst,Holyoke) is 7ish a share, TILRAY is heating up quickly. Perhaps a break to talk about the green vs the gold for the younger fans who have much less to invest?

1026 2018-08-19 03:35:42 I think they recalled all their stocks to sell at the stadium. Why didn’t I buy it earlier when it was still available? 
1027 2018-08-19 03:33:57 They will have an 80% or more fall very soon, 2019 will we the end of tech stocks as we know it.
1028 2018-08-19 03:33:36 I've really reached peak levels of detachment.

I decided to buy sneakers from target vs the nike ones I was looking at. The way I see it is:

Ima be a bad bitch in either pair regardless. One just allows me to be a bad bitch with an extra $140 to invest in stocks.
1029 2018-08-19 03:33:12 Consuming. I went through the same thing when I first started trading stocks. The market is unforgiving for everyone not just folks in crypto. But that exposure led me to find something I enjoyed, college, Wall Street, and eventually working for myself. If it wasn’t for that my
1030 2018-08-19 03:32:27 Basically it is built how most stock quant models are built these days. It analyzes characteristics of coins (or stocks) & sees how they relate to the next periods returns. As in, what characteristics led to returns. Do that every day in history & you know what drives performance

1037 2018-08-19 03:25:18 Economy is on the same projection it's been on for years, no better, no worse, your stats aren't anything remarkable and your tarrifs will damage within a year.  Your growth rate is no stronger, stocks are exact same path, you lie about all this but it's easily vetted.

He's an Anarcho-Syndicalist & LibSocs like Bookchin acknowledge this as a right-wing approach to achieving anarchistic goals through collective ownership of corps through stocks/decentralization/shrinking states.

Sorry but I have to cancel this one because I won’t be able to get the stocks before con day and it’s a hassle to get it from the middleman at con day and give it to buyer at the same day as I’m part of the soundcheck.
1042 2018-08-19 03:22:53 Actually tied second highest with rat, SC didn’t do much + a lot of them got 33rd. I also got to play in the SC NC crew battle and took 2 stocks in that. Wish the stream didn’t die but that was cool.

1056 2018-08-19 02:55:12 Yeah that’s kind of why I usually keep a core position, if bitcoin does go back up to mid teens even, these stocks are going to be multi-baggers easy from where they’re at now. Although it could be a ways away it’s hard to gauge the crypto market right now.

1089 2018-08-19 01:53:39 Just finished that book about two week ago, good stuff 
1090 2018-08-19 01:49:04 If you’re investing money you can’t afford to lose, it may be difficult to lock your funds away for an extended period. It could also cause you to panic if stocks fall. If you can’t afford to invest today, it might be best to wait until you’re in a better financial position.
1091 2018-08-19 01:48:50 1.) I started in crypto in 2017 and learnt a lot from my own mistakes so far. This year, I have been very conservative in the number of trades I make in crypto. Also, I started trading stocks this year to see how that world works.
1092 2018-08-19 01:48:32 Additional stocks ONHAND. grab yours now 
1093 2018-08-19 01:46:50 That's exactly why I stay away from European stocks even though they are cheap. 
I also believe that US markets are the BEST investment available today! Look, you don't want to play the other side, trust me! I wouldn't advise doing something like shorting $NQU or $ESU!
1094 2018-08-19 01:46:38 Yeah Walmart pretty much only stocks old lady shit in store, all the cute stuff is for s/m/l/xl but yeah there's been more maternity shit in stores than plus size stuff
1095 2018-08-19 01:46:31 Time to tank their stocks
1096 2018-08-19 01:44:30 Nowhere left for traders other than penny stocks.  #PENNYSTOCKS #stockmarket
1097 2018-08-19 01:43:42 expanding your way of income in many ways is awesome i.e. getting into stocks and buying property
1098 2018-08-19 01:41:56 More robust means, buffer warehouse stocks, whole new logistics & greater costs, even perhaps change of product lines, in a competitive market place, none of which is possible by March next year.
1099 2018-08-19 01:41:33 The GOP tax cuts gave the corporations and the wealthy a lot of money to buy up stocks, that's my guess at least.
1100 2018-08-19 01:40:06 lol you could probably use that 250 a week and try to invest in stocks  5K-7.5K is still a big amount, but where are you gonna put it all aren't you in an apartment? or living with a roomate?
1101 2018-08-19 01:39:32 Another side note: $NVDA was up 30% YTD before it fell 4%. #perspective #stocks
1102 2018-08-19 01:39:06 Also surprised to discover that the dot com bust was just really tech. Many stocks actually went up. 

In a bull market every style, factor whatever works really. But shit, who wants to say “yeah, I got really lucky”.
1103 2018-08-19 01:38:01 Is the preference to short into strength as opposed to stocks trending down?

1115 2018-08-19 01:22:36 How do you explain that the banking stocks are holding so well?
1116 2018-08-19 01:20:39 Another reason I'm holding on to $MU and $NVDA is alot of the downside has been due to a weak semi sector due to the #china trade risks. I expect both to recover and continue their strong momentum. The market does not like uncertainty, and these two #stocks are proof.

1126 2018-08-19 01:05:27 It's all about diversification. Stocks, real estate, emerging tech. Everyone approaches this like, "I have to take out a loan or sell some retirement and go all in". No, it's a 2-5% diversification on your retirement portfolio. Especially at these levels.
1127 2018-08-19 01:05:18 Health sector stocks are good and healthy. The state of healthcare for citizens in America, not so much.
1128 2018-08-19 01:02:41 Do you have a favorite list of stocks that you invest in? I'm currently invested in NVDA.
1129 2018-08-19 00:59:24 Certainly not discriminating against you. Apparently you can hop on an spew nastiness at our allies, our intelligence service, women of color and companies you don't like or want to manipulate their stocks. Disgraceful and an embarrassment to our country #shameful

1132 2018-08-19 00:55:12 People will be able to unlock liquidity from assets they already own (real estate, car, invoices, stocks, crypto, art) w/out selling them, effectively writing themselves 0% interest loans on their own payment terms.

1138 2018-08-19 00:49:32 A good CEO and a good company doesn't care about who short or long their stocks. Which is something clearly Elon is lacking of.

1140 2018-08-19 00:49:04 $VEC Having said all that about the POG, I stick to my opinion that emerging stocks like $VEC are very little if at all affected, because they have to run their own race. Their SP will simply depend on news flow and I trust @JBrewerMining and $VEC management to look after that!
1141 2018-08-19 00:48:37 Concentrated positions, deep value, out of favor industries that are at tipping point, and probably leverage. Used on deep value stocks with decent liquidity and that you have a fragile thread of a margin of safety.
1142 2018-08-19 00:47:56 Unless we see a major correction in the overall market, I still see another frenzy this fall for #cannabis stocks especially ones that have sensible floats (sub 100m for the micro/nano ones)
1143 2018-08-19 00:47:11 Not that your methods are any better than anybody else’s, people have there own opinion about which mentorship is best. But I think the thinking here is that there is o my so much you can teach with stocks and options or whatever. For the little guy $179 a month is steep I guess
1144 2018-08-19 00:46:32 This is a very dumb hill to die on. Also, read your own linked story.
1145 2018-08-19 00:44:13 Another good example that no one pays attention to stocks in the TSXV/CSE hated sectors such as #Blockchain & #crypto. Clearly there are quality companies in the sector that are doing well as a business, however it seems that for now everything is tethered on price of $BTC
1146 2018-08-19 00:41:31 lmao my job fucked me over and only gave me one share in stocks and i can’t access it until 2020 only if i continue working here. love it
1147 2018-08-19 00:37:37 Do you think Amazon stock would do worse if bezos did earnings calls? Maybe these stocks outperformed because they were great businesses. Nothing to do with if ceo met with street or not
1148 2018-08-19 00:36:57 Agree. Playing with fire when these stocks are in distribution mode. Might have to reshort $FB and $GOOGL that I closed friday
1149 2018-08-19 00:36:22 Nobody trust you, and you don't even get it. I don't use you anymore. You have become irrelevant and your stocks will show it soon
1150 2018-08-19 00:31:58 Well if he did not do nothing. Bush had us in the tank. You need to ck numbers. Stocks when obama went into office 7800. When he left office 18000.  Unemployment at a high9.4. When he left 4.8. And he turned around the auto industry.  What did you want him to do
1151 2018-08-19 00:29:38 Any ETA on mint stocks?

1159 2018-08-19 00:19:06 Your wrong. Right now, as more goods and services are created, so it more fiat. To preserve value, a poor person must go through the banking system, then a broker (real estate, stocks or bonds).  In a bitcoin economy, btc supply is fixed, and it increases in purchasing power as..
1160 2018-08-19 00:18:41 Lmao @ me writing a paper on climate change’s effects on the fisheries industry and inserting a long winded section on the impacts of fish stocks on real, marginalized, mostly coastal and Indigenous people  everything is political
1161 2018-08-19 00:17:37 I suppose the investing time horizon would probably guide one to review frequently the market value of one's investment (via qtrly reports etc.).  When I purchased my first multifamily apartment building, I didn't review its market value until 5 years after to refi. Stocks why?
1162 2018-08-19 00:17:36 Did either of you do the Google search I provided before giving each other a Twitter high five? Sites that run the gamut from comics, to entertainment, to market/ stocks are all telling you what you refuse to believe. The average reader dislikes the current state of Marvel

1224 2018-08-18 23:06:43 I have read a couple sound comments on this. When you see 400+ equities in the space bells should be going off. When you are sitting at the bar and guys next to you are talking uranium stocks you should be selling them yours. U308 $120 lbs.+ would be an indicator too. More?

A: Is it Diluting or Converting shares. I want to know the "Latest share structure from TA as this can change "Daily" on stocks that are converting. Its the "First" & "Main" question i will "ALWAYS" ask anyone.
1234 2018-08-18 22:59:13 Lo cubrís imponiendo sobre stocks de riqueza y no sobre flujos de ingreso.

1238 2018-08-18 22:55:57 Must go after institutional ownership of these stocks. FB, google, twitter are making a strong case for gov intervention, & class action lawsuits. They’d better get it together. If they are going to censor & lobby, they must be treated accordingly

1254 2018-08-18 22:35:57 Certainly seems extremely short-term-bearish for the stock market.  The opposite condition was certainly was bullish for stocks.
1255 2018-08-18 22:32:53 I want to create “hindsight news”. I’ll tell you about all the news after it happened and which stocks you should have invested in after they already went up. @ComfortablySmug

1267 2018-08-18 22:13:15 @RealJamesWoods I’m seriously thinking about selling all of my stocks and liquidating my 401k in advance of a d takeover of Congress. The idea of Maxine Waters being one of the most powerful people in the county is outright horrifying. Thoughts?

1284 2018-08-18 21:54:27 Yes, 100%.  This why/how lack of foreign buying enforces US Trilemma (US can have 2 of 3 of rising rates, rising USD, rising stocks on sustained basis.)  “In a pinch Fed buys remaining inventory” = USD negative.

1290 2018-08-18 21:50:53 I was in apocalypse collapse camp a few years back and didn't want any cash, just PM and some Bitcoin.  But, listening carefully to Malloney and Dent you realise that cash becomes King first in deflation before it collapses in hyperinflation i.e. sell stocks/property, hold cash.
1291 2018-08-18 21:49:54 Ha ha long season mate, we’ve started well but the rest of this month is tough and intense (Swansea/Norwich/Cup on the tues boro on the Friday) then a break and into Millwall who keep taking scalps at home (Derby today)
1292 2018-08-18 21:49:09 Far more complex than this my friend! As I said commercial fishing is done not only in local waters or national limits but also in international waters. Maintaining fish stocks in UK waters imply quotas organized at european & global level.

1302 2018-08-18 21:43:20 it is my humble opinion that buying Tech stocks is a REALLY bad bad idea..just sayin...with them censoring everyone they don't like i ask that all patriots dump tech stocks!  please. this is really important, we are losing our 1st Amendment

1306 2018-08-18 21:40:14 Gotta learn there’s no rush. Sit back. Pick spots. Just a buy opp for me but I only trade stocks so I probably don’t think like a day trader. The market she’s unforgiving for lack of discipline. Been there.
1307 2018-08-18 21:39:42 Ask me at Christmas
1308 2018-08-18 21:39:25 Start with a statement of your objective.  Mine is to make money by trading in leading stocks using analysis of supply and demand for entries and exits.
1309 2018-08-18 21:38:49 First of two @PearlJam shows tonight at Wrigley...buying stocks on the day of the crash!!!
1310 2018-08-18 21:38:43 We've got at at least 7 new Super Stocks on the grounds tonight, with 20 total right now! We've even got one all the way from Bakersfield! You won't want to miss tonight's action!
1311 2018-08-18 21:38:13 Any of you Econ majors wanna help me lean how to day trade stocks hehe
1312 2018-08-18 21:36:53 We absolutely need to codify rules for the office, including anti-nepotism rules that specifically apply to a POTUS; # of work hours/week and vacation days; personal use of AF1; divestment of any businesses & stocks; & press access to POTUS and minimum # of daily press briefings.
1313 2018-08-18 21:35:31 Jackson is a hippocampus who trades stocks for fun.
1314 2018-08-18 21:35:22 The economy is worse than it ever has been, borrowing money from our future to create a facade a horrible decision. With that being said buy up on your stocks so I can swoop in when it crashes.
1315 2018-08-18 21:35:05 That’s the “privilege” these primary dealer banks get as part of their stock in the Federal Reserve System. (This is what throws the conspiracy theorists into a fit about the Fed being a private entity & all that cranky stuff - oh, look they get stocks )

1316 2018-08-18 21:35:03 Remember when Kylie tweeted about Snapchat stories being worse ? Their stocks and shares dropped and they updated Snapchat 2 days later jskdsk her POWER.
1317 2018-08-18 21:33:28 it is my humble opinion that buying Tech stocks is a REALLY bad bad idea..just sayin...with them censoring everyone they don't like i ask that all patriots dump and tech stocks!  please. this is really important, we are losing our 1st Amendment 
1318 2018-08-18 21:33:26 @E_SGVScanner No Christopher Robin, you don't have to play river stocks with your body, Pooh Bear wouldn't approve!
1319 2018-08-18 21:33:17 Really? Do they really think conservatives in Queensland like Dutton? Geez, Pauline’s stocks are gonna go up even further!

1326 2018-08-18 21:22:33 I'm imagining a scenario where the librarian that stocks your hold shelf falls in love with you via your reading list.
1327 2018-08-18 21:21:29 Yes.  AFAIK, as long as US stocks never fall like Japan, the math generally works out well.  And if US stocks pull a Japan, US is gonna default on entitlements, USTs, or DoD (or all 3), so there will be bigger fish to fry.
1328 2018-08-18 21:20:59 I should invest on some @amazon stocks.
1329 2018-08-18 21:18:51 This is a business news emergency broadcast. The Politics Advocates are pushing legislation that could impact the future shares of  SHOO stocks. Thank you for tuning into  CNN.
1330 2018-08-18 21:17:16 Lo que temo es que haya gente que diga "Huy es que este matchup específico es muy lento y aburrido de ver" tras un set muy específico que casualmente se haya jugado lento y se empiece a empujar por las 2 stocks
1331 2018-08-18 21:16:30 @JonTronShow hey Jon  I have a suggestion for a video for you it's (hold on to ya butts) A Movie review!!   how about you review the two latest vibrant stocks that sprung from Steven Spielberg's loins? When I say latest I mean not Ai or anything but the jurassic ones 
1332 2018-08-18 21:15:47 I swear, #Gamergate is now to Game Journalists what "Muh Russians!" is to Cable Media. A boogeyman for people to bring up when they want to demonize a group of people. #MainStreamMedia can't collapse fast enough, I hope their stocks crash harder than their ethics.
1333 2018-08-18 21:15:14 No, Vanguard just remodeled their Precious Metals Fund VGPMX, now it’s only 25% metals, rest is cyclical commodity oriented stocks, natural resources, infrastructure
1334 2018-08-18 21:14:56 Clearly you don't know satire, or John Paul Jones, or the fellow who lives down the street with that nasty skin condition who has to get that ointment they carry at CVS on the 3rd shelf right below the orthopedic stuff or the young lady who stocks it part time to pay for college
1335 2018-08-18 21:14:42 *doesn't know how much stocks cost is disrespectful as she does lol, next time you want to debate someone, you should directly engage in the argument instead of attempting to insult the other person which is an 'Ad Hominem fallacy' (google it)
1336 2018-08-18 21:14:21 The question is... How can one buy all these foreign stocks????
1337 2018-08-18 21:14:06 Fuel up those U stocks! 
1338 2018-08-18 21:12:44 Invest the $10 in stocks and get ez profits so you can buy 5000 chicken nuggets from mac donalds
1339 2018-08-18 21:11:57 I hope an pray we exile Trump and his enablers at some point. Seize all their foreign assets ahead of time and then turn them loose with no money and few friends. If not that, then drawing and quartering after a week in the public stocks would be OK with me, too.

1341 2018-08-18 21:09:35 During the festival season, there is the looming threat of yakisoba sets reaching low stocks.
1342 2018-08-18 21:08:24 In case you're buying foreign stock, consider buying Facebook stocks. In 10 years, you'll wish you did what I just said, especially if you could now.
1343 2018-08-18 21:07:01 Buying stocks for the public reifies finance, but forcing women to prove the are "care" providers before getting income is socialist...
1344 2018-08-18 21:05:58 Netflix stocks keeps dropping. When are people going to realize that if you make a political stand for the left you will distroy your business.
1345 2018-08-18 21:04:56 *furiously starts checking pet stocks to buy at the open*
1346 2018-08-18 21:03:14 Trading stocks is stressful sometimes lol.. I go in 100% and fuck up .. but I end up making back 400% within the same day.. So it's a GG 
1347 2018-08-18 21:03:05 I don't think KSA is missing any of it. I believe KSA is putting oil where it best serves their price goals. At the moment, the goal is to decrease price, so loading up US inventories. In past, wanted to drop price, so loaded up CN, and made areas that report stock #'s use stocks

1356 2018-08-18 20:54:29 Defensive stocks that hit my screen this week are JNJ, ADM & MDT I hope VWO works. My math shows 40% upside potential on emerging markets but if the banks keep reducing liquidity, it could be a while before that comes true.

1358 2018-08-18 20:53:07 Not true. How does letting the whole EU fish in our waters conserve stocks ?
1359 2018-08-18 20:52:44 But my brother is happy, because his stocks are up.  I wasn't raised by wolves, but he's six years older.....maybe I missed something.  He IS heavy...he's my brother.
1360 2018-08-18 20:52:16 Jeez! Laughing stocks of Scotland! BaHahahaha! 
1361 2018-08-18 20:50:40 I've got some bad news for you Joshua, my system isn't showing that the store stocks the 200g sour cream & chive dip anymore. If you speak to my colleagues at the customer service desk they may be able to order some in for you. 1/2
1362 2018-08-18 20:49:58 Let me give you a little peak into the near future, crypto is massive, it’s digital gold. It will fuel all sorts of applications. For example, securities like stocks and bonds will be digitalized in a Ether token form, it will enable custody of portfolios locally in your own PC
1363 2018-08-18 20:47:23 Good exchange with good prizes! Definitely recommending!

And I kept it respectable at 2 stocks each game lol
1370 2018-08-18 20:32:47 “I like garlic bread, I—

1371 2018-08-18 20:32:36 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
1372 2018-08-18 20:32:15 No worries. Yea sometimes bad fills make you miss some profit or have a bad entry, just practice getting in when the stocks reaches your target and level 2 shows a price you’re comfortable with.
1373 2018-08-18 20:31:49 What an idiot. Did you forget about 401ks. All the people who have a 401k and the corporations are doing better that helps them. Stocks going up help them and you. Quit complaining about tax cuts, start working on spending cuts. That will help everybody out. Do you job!
1374 2018-08-18 20:30:38 Oh I've seen stocks like those, but I feel like that contradicts what you said earlier with the earnings stocks barely getting 10%. It's percentage since I'm putting in so little, but my trades are based on how much the stock can go, not strict 10%
1375 2018-08-18 20:28:53 Curious of the market opportunity of investing/money management content for high school/college grads. Only about 50% American households own stocks and there is little education on personal investing in high school and even college
1376 2018-08-18 20:28:04 Creo que la mayoría de opiniones al respecto es jugar a 3 stocks, no creo que haya problema 
1377 2018-08-18 20:25:39 Carbamazepine stocks are zero...my chemist doesn’t know what happened or when a delivery is coming in, it’s Carricks epilepsy medication...
1378 2018-08-18 20:25:11 no question that's part of it, but the bubble in tech stocks is an even bigger reason since there are shortages all up and down the valley and it's killing anybody outside of tech
1379 2018-08-18 20:22:40 By "failed" you must mean "total success"  as wages are up, jobs are up, stocks are up,  housimg mkt is up, taxes are lower, govt is smaller, north Korea has yielded...need I go on
1380 2018-08-18 20:20:42 Lol, I deleted it. The ladies don't DM me shooting any shots lol. Pretty people business that. The most I get from them is them asking what stocks to buy lool! And yes, I'm a jazz fan... 'Kind of Blue' is etched in my brain...
1381 2018-08-18 20:19:10 @moac_io one of the best promising project!
1382 2018-08-18 20:18:53 I took 2 finance class in high school that essentially revolves around stocks and the stock market. And yet @thatchaddaniels is the one who taught me what the difference between a bull market and a bear market is
1383 2018-08-18 20:18:44 Obsessed with the sparkling rhubarb @cawstonpress at the moment. It’s both amazing and dangerous that the shop across the road stocks it

1386 2018-08-18 20:17:52 Espero que en Smash Ultimate no juguemos 2 stocks. Es una de las peores cosas de haber jugado Smash 4, en mi opinión.
Aunque veo a gente capaz de argumentar que se debería jugar a 1 porque a cada juego ha decrecido el número de stocks
1387 2018-08-18 20:17:10 A black man can’t just sit around all day expecting to have constant flow of money unless he set himself up in stocks a black man has to get it 24/7 unlike the white man whose family an generations set him to be rich / born wealthy
1388 2018-08-18 20:16:24 I actually rate VT1. 5 hit fireball which covers the screen fast, can't be ducked, can juggle, can be juggled from and is only -2 at point blank range? Biggest flaw it has is the 3 stocks imo.
1389 2018-08-18 20:15:48 Should have bought some penny stocks with that
1390 2018-08-18 20:14:58 End goal w/ mining stocks: buy low n sell high

Indirect route (shortcut) to obtain passive income/financial freedom.

That’s it.

Don’t get too greedy. Know when to call it a day.

Use proceeds to acquire REAL WEALTH assets: rental properties, personal home, dividend stocks, etc
1391 2018-08-18 20:14:47 Not just about PHARMA disabling a worker class just intelligent enough to work..When they announce a BOGUS outbreak their stocks soar..take a look at Merck & Co stocks!
1392 2018-08-18 20:12:26 Absolutely because it has nothing to do with party. Both republicans & democrats receive profits from their stocks where some of those profits come from foreign governments.
1393 2018-08-18 20:11:45 I feel it's understated how important stocks are in Smash, as well. This makes it so that even if you are behind, a simple error or good read can flip the whole game around and put you ahead. Traditionally it's much harder, and you get to even before actually getting ahead
1394 2018-08-18 20:11:26 My eyes!!!! So many T-shirts!! Who stocks these in the U.K and Ireland? Finding it harder to get merch these days!!!!
1395 2018-08-18 20:11:21 Well no just relax and buy good consumer stocks, and I like your work we can discuss somethings when you are free.
1396 2018-08-18 20:10:47 "Historically, the quarry produced the aggregate - were buying bitumen of good quality, produced through a standardised - selective crude stocks, it always worked....we’re going to be able to engineer a bitumen specifically for your quarry. -OK CAN I HAVE THE SAME AS LAST TIME?
1397 2018-08-18 20:10:26 I haven’t seen him in the stocks. Now that would be a boost for the rotten tomato industry.
1398 2018-08-18 20:06:19 @PeterLBrandt and @SJosephBurns are a few of the must follows if you are new to stocks and want to learn risk management, discipline and execution! Only a few of the things I can fit in one tweet that they can help you with if you #study !

1401 2018-08-18 20:03:06 It would also be a good idea to invest in forex or even crypto as well. It is the largest financial market in the world and many times larget than stocks.
1402 2018-08-18 20:03:02 How does one invest their money to make more ? Like creative ways ? I know stocks, clearly lol but something different
1403 2018-08-18 20:02:49 Thank you to everyone who came to our sample sale today!

We are restocking what we have left for tomorrow including our tables and string lights and will also have a small amount of jewellery and homeware samples to add.

While stocks last!
1404 2018-08-18 20:00:46 nice chart, one other thing may help is analyse the mass dilution caused by many stocks in the Hui index.  That may cause Hui to lose in half.  just my speculation.
1405 2018-08-18 19:57:40 Dude you literally don’t get it.. they were working together on the first one but klait said he felt bad that Stocks did most of the work so he made his own from scratch!!! They both look good so who cares!! They are different
1406 2018-08-18 19:57:24 For 99% of people crypto should only be a small (sub 10%) of their overall portfolio. Like you said Crypto vol will dominate. Heck people don’t realize that in a 60/40 stock/bond portfolio that nearly all the volatility comes from stocks. Crypto is that on roids
1407 2018-08-18 19:56:36 That is good. I would recommend to look into investing into forex too. Forex is similar to stocks but a much larger financial markets where the big banks make the most of their money. In fact, there is a free webinar coming up to show ppl how they can learn and earn in this.
1408 2018-08-18 19:55:39 @drbabelovelife I will like, those that I would like to use. Please note that when I talk about stocks I use GIRLS, so if you're okay with that, I'd be honored to have you join the fun! Feel free to follow anytime! Cheers!
1409 2018-08-18 19:54:12 ADORABLE. I might go out and buy a visor so it’s on the stocks for any children I may have. It’s just too cute not to.
1410 2018-08-18 19:52:36 Hello guys what a great project
1411 2018-08-18 19:52:26 looking up stocks is like looking for an outfit on date night..
1412 2018-08-18 19:49:48 Actually the tax cuts benefited 98% of Americans clearly only get media propaganda and seriously my back Apple stocks a company who just in $1 trillion net worth first ever in history? What?!? Look at the actual numbers double standard deduction doubled child credit
1413 2018-08-18 19:46:29 Twitter friends, what, may I ask, are your favorite never-sell blue chip, dividend-paying stocks? Where you may park your non-trading “safe” money. Just curious... Thx!
$DIS $JNJ $AAPL
1414 2018-08-18 19:44:54 Also, who teaches kids about saving, investing, corporate law, or the power of compound interest? Or the difference between penny stocks an reit or extra cheese fries? Financial education is non-existent in school, and this is a multi-generational problem, but it is NOT rascist!
1415 2018-08-18 19:44:16 Cattle act bullish but everyone pretty complacent or down and out, same goes for stocks, they are at or near highs and people pretty bearish it seems or just fatigued. Hmm.
1416 2018-08-18 19:41:52 Very promising project indeed!
1417 2018-08-18 19:41:28 You know nearly none of that shit helps the average person, right? Most people don't own stocks. Most of us haven't seen a wage increase in years.  And the tax break put money into the pockets of CEOs and not people like me that are caring for a sick spouse.  So, fuck yourself.
1418 2018-08-18 19:39:29 Why they just want to save? They don’t put it into stocks or buy properties?
1419 2018-08-18 19:38:20 We are about an hour out from qualifying for the #NWAAS Late Model qualifying. Support divisions – Pro Six, Grand Stocks, and Karts – are currently on track for their rotating practice sessions @LangleySpeedway
1420 2018-08-18 19:38:03 Ehh. I think we differ here. I think there are TONS of low margin retailers whose stocks have behaved VERY well over the last ten years, plus they also tend to be defensive in nature.
1421 2018-08-18 19:37:36 Alors c'est pas un problème, même si les stocks sont épuisés ta participation compte, c'est pris en considération au moment où tu as posté ton lien ;)
1422 2018-08-18 19:36:46 IMO Much earlier than that because of XAUUSD falling. Gold plummets before stocks and real estate. Late 2019 / Early 2020 will most likely bring a crash.
1423 2018-08-18 19:34:46 "How many stocks do you own?"

"One".

Sound investing strategy!
1424 2018-08-18 19:33:23 When stocks?
1425 2018-08-18 19:32:57 Pretty fly for a white guy.
1426 2018-08-18 19:32:42 I have a lil crush on the lady who stocks the shelves a my local Aldi’s

1428 2018-08-18 19:30:56 Also Trader Joe’s. I’m pretty sure Kroger stocks some too.
1429 2018-08-18 19:30:25 totally deosnt looks like stocks ad lol
1430 2018-08-18 19:30:00 I don’t get the high water dress pants and dress shoes with no stocks fad....

1432 2018-08-18 19:26:20 I pick jumping into a campfire. Holding a can of gasoline
 With 2 stocks of dynamite. One in each pocket.
1433 2018-08-18 19:26:17 3) It's though Motley Fool takes its best minds and says, "Hey, we're paying you by the length, but every piece you write, be it 200 words or 400 words, has to end with a reminder of a newsletter we sell or stocks we're promoting."

1441 2018-08-18 19:15:42 I’m from Spain, dont know much about how this works in the US but I guess that with a broker that allows trading in international stocks it will be possible to buy YCA in the London Stock Exchange.

1444 2018-08-18 19:12:24 Some stocks I occasionally follow that report this week:
8/22: $TGT
8/23: $INTU $ADSK $VMW $BABA $HRL

I say occasionally because can’t say I’ve been following these too closely lately, so not a lot of opinion...

1450 2018-08-18 19:05:41 Divorcing your spouse in order to get your "freedom" is one thing, but to take everything they have made and earned is another thing. (retirement, stocks, alimony, insurance) It's simply, robbery. Does it really make sense that someone should pay you to divorce them?
1451 2018-08-18 19:05:11 I believe that a setback for a #stock that you know will go up in the long term is an opportunity to buy more at a lower price, not cut my "losses". I believe in #investing in fundamentals and that is how I assess my stocks #investing #money
1452 2018-08-18 19:02:15 Q: SS, What kinds of stocks do you look for ?

A: 90.9% of all my picks have come from either the Year low, All-time lows or near it, thats OTC & Big Boards. So i target bottom plays when possible. If a company is going to pump a stock where do you think they will pump it from ?
1453 2018-08-18 19:01:58 Just to be fair, it's a bit harder to divest real estate holdings than stocks and bonds. It's also hard to put them in a blind trust when you can walk past them every day.
1454 2018-08-18 19:01:50 I always thought John Adams got short shrift for his pithy "Bump stocks for nukes, booyah!"
1455 2018-08-18 18:59:43 Thought of the day building a diversified portfolio of UK AIM stocks using the simple growth criteria I use would be an impossible task. Simply isn't enough real growth to do it
1456 2018-08-18 18:59:29 You heard of the NFA? Automatic weapons are pretty much banned.

Bump stocks are the logical outcome of the NFA. High rates of fire will always have a demand, and people will get it one way or another. Banning legal ownership hurts law abiding citizens, and protects criminals.

1459 2018-08-18 18:57:42 Investing purely in growth stocks is like jumping on a fast-moving train, not because you know where it's going or why, but because it's moving fast and it sounds fun.

1464 2018-08-18 18:54:52 Stocks are the best game in town bro!
1465 2018-08-18 18:54:43 One thing I’ve learned from stocks is to start valuing items you want before you buy them.. Then check the price. You’ll be able to determine if something is over or under valued. You’ll save lot of money this way!

1468 2018-08-18 18:51:23 i know what you're saying, its got more and more people skeptical lately about even trading otc stocks, its getting bad now when you see fake news, filings & reinstatements and have to second guess whether to get in or not, it can deceive even experienced traders.

1474 2018-08-18 18:35:49 "the broad availability of stocks allows investors to diversify their portfolios (either directly or through mutual funds)... That’s why it is a problem that stock markets have in recent years been shrinking (again, by listings, not by market cap)." @andreskluth on @handelsblatt

1491 2018-08-18 18:22:44 I tend to disagree. People should be mature enough to be open to other opinions on stocks. It's actually good to get opposite opinions for improving your learnings. But you can choose to agree or disagree.

1494 2018-08-18 18:20:57 The true contrarian is not the investor who takes the opposite side of a hot stock. The true contrarian waits for things to cool down and buys quality stocks that nobody cares about, and especially those that make Wall Street yawn.

1514 2018-08-18 18:07:12 The NRA supports the ban of bump stocks. Federal law says you have to be 21 to buy a handgun, but yes 18 to possess.
1515 2018-08-18 18:05:56 Actually this statement is wrong TCP. Both for stocks, Bitcoin and other markets. Double check by looking at any long term chart, Google it or just use logic when thinking about the development of major indexes over time. Indexes wouldn't multiply every x year if you were right.
1516 2018-08-18 18:04:33 Well the economy is booming, unemployment lower than ever. Stocks higher than ever , consumer confidence highest in decades. Trade renegotiated. No new wars, seems like the answer is really no.

1517 2018-08-18 18:03:50 Stocks are relatively predictable over ten to twenty years. As to whether they are going to be higher or lower in two or three years, you might as well flip a coin.

1547 2018-08-18 17:35:51 Obviously, after a huge rally most stocks would be overvalued. Value investors have to wait for a stock or sector to go out of favour. 
Currently, metals and HFCs are out of favour - some bargains there.

1556 2018-08-18 17:29:25 The size of a bet should be adjusted by volatility e.g. a $100 stocks bet is equivalent to a $20 crypto bet. A 100% return on that crypto bet is equivalent to a 20% return on that stocks bet. ==> % return on a position is irrelevant. What matters is the % return on a portfolio.

1558 2018-08-18 17:27:30 "It's in the nature of long term shareholding of the normal vicissitudes, in worldly outcomes, and in markets that the long-term holder has his quoted value of his stocks go down by say 50%."

1559 2018-08-18 17:27:30 It funny when he said says the market is doing great but most of my stocks are in American stocks and they have lost money why? They are not crappy stocks either. Maybe he means him and his families stocks are doing great

1561 2018-08-18 17:25:52 At least its not like otc stocks were you can't do shit with the certs because nobody will accept them or the company's drags their feet on clearing them. I've had some otc certs for like 7 years that are worth nice $$$ but can't do shit with them

1575 2018-08-18 17:10:16 I wish someone would do a public presentation on national television about how, under current central bank policies, the 'safest' investment (savings) are designed to lose money and the 'riskiest' investment (stocks) are designed to create huge gains with virtually no risk.

1579 2018-08-18 17:08:14 Look at US stocks. If you add up the bear cycles since Y2k, what is it ? We had a less than 1 year "bear mkt" in 2000 and a less than 1 year "bear mkt" in 2008. Barely 2 years in 18 years. This isn't capitalism. These aren't markets. Not in stocks or gold. So I have no answers.

1585 2018-08-18 17:02:21 The economy is stronger & better for the wealthy who got massive tax breaks and the shareholders who bought back their stocks. But, I know too many middle-class families who are living paycheck to paycheck & are 1 emergency away from not being able to their pay their bills.

1596 2018-08-18 16:45:30 Real talk, with small biotech stocks. The less I see of other people tagging them in tweets the more I love owning them.

1616 2018-08-18 16:23:00 you keep saying that, but you're criticizing Obama who elevated the GDP, brought back jobs, brought the stock market from 6500 to almost 20,000... why the double standard? Stocks have been stagnating since Jan, GDP has its ups and downs, you can't feel the trade - its worse..

1621 2018-08-18 16:19:35 I don't have to think he cares. I see it  in the economy, GDP, stocks, low unemployment, my paycheck, fair trade, bonuses...
1622 2018-08-18 16:19:03 Stocks bought 20~30 years ago have returned users the original and multiple times over in interests. It’s not about who said it, it’s how long term wealth management works. It’s the basis of economy for most countries.
1623 2018-08-18 16:17:07 Et bien.... *soupire* tenez. Mais c’est la dernière hein. Parce que sinon mes stocks vont se vider rapidement.

1625 2018-08-18 16:13:54 Later today I'll be posting a video reviewing technical analysis how to setup trades for stocks moving in premarket to attack long and short at open  when you see how simple my strategy is it will question what you have learned by your furu.
1626 2018-08-18 16:13:05 Trump fully understands the job criteria, and exceeds it on a daily basis. It’s the left that doesn’t. They’ve been snookered so long they think the swamp is doing great. Jobs & stocks up, unemployment down, Isis on the run. (4 real this time, not like when obama said it)
1627 2018-08-18 16:10:37 Only if you can tell me how bump stocks and high-capacity magazines will decrease violence in the inner cities?
1628 2018-08-18 16:09:16 I suppose as stocks dwindle, they have to make gold out of lead.... Still, it’s pretty tasty lead. I’m still hanging onto a bottle of my L7325 Uig.
1629 2018-08-18 16:07:08 But seriously  assets should have their future cash flows (for stocks) or growth discounted... looking at the “current” (with no future discounting) value makes little sense for what is basically a start up
1630 2018-08-18 16:06:41 Everyone is trumpeting the new high in NYSE cumulative advance / decline as an all clear for growth areas of the market. 
I prefer to look at this data in context with other indexes and the rotation currently happening (to defensive stocks)

1632 2018-08-18 16:06:01 $BLNK if you’re buying stocks because the share price you’re doing it wrong. Share price is irrelevant. Buy the company, not the share price
1633 2018-08-18 16:04:26 Yes, it does. I'll have to see, again, if someone stocks it here. The farm shop has £7 shipping, so it's not possible for me to order any now.

1636 2018-08-18 16:03:11 How about non-low flow float stocks? As a beginner, I avoid frontside moves overall regardless of the float and wait for backside. Would you agree?
1637 2018-08-18 16:01:03 @Soleil_Manga Bonjour, après avoir lu le début de l'incroyable série Dorohedoro, je fus dans l'incapacité d'acheter la suite a cause de stocks insuffisant. Avez-vous prévu de réimprimer la série prochainement ? Cela me rendrai guilleret.
1638 2018-08-18 16:00:18 Is this so you can boost your mates stocks again?
1639 2018-08-18 15:58:46 The pattern does seem to be the $NYFANG stocks giving in, a couple at a time. And therefore that index and #NDX have been weaker than the mkt.
1640 2018-08-18 15:57:46 That may be true, but the economy is growing the stocks are up and your benefiting like everyone else! Or we could go back to Obama- have 0

1643 2018-08-18 15:57:20 Yep.  My first tip when people ask me about ICO investing or picking individual stocks is...don’t.  ICOs have a far worse negative selection effect.

1646 2018-08-18 15:56:12 Parfois, il y a des coups de justice poétique, quand même : des sales types avaient acheté des stocks de #RadiantHistoria pour les mettre en vente day-one le double, misant sur un tirage faible sans réédition. Même pas deux mois plus tard, retirage à l'identique du jeu ^^ .
1647 2018-08-18 15:55:30 Cool.  How's that look? 
It seems everyone is debating the "few stocks leading the S&P" Too broad a metric
I'm interested in "few stocks leading the Nasdaq composite" -- as a trade catalyst.
1648 2018-08-18 15:54:13 Sure does. I just remember Karma is a bitch for those who bash stocks for "fun". I'm the self fulfilling prophecy type, aka "law of attraction", & all of that negative energy they put out comes back to them in their personal lives, I GUARANTEE IT!

1650 2018-08-18 15:51:50 The biggest lie that I’ve been fed throughout countless books is that every market move is not controlled and therefore random.  $btc #stocks
1651 2018-08-18 15:51:31 I have no doubt in it, don’t get me wrong. But have your eyes open, always. Follow the right people because it’s very hard to get rid of bad habits once you got them at the start. Lower your share size=risk focus on reliable stocks instead of pumps this is how I became consistent
1652 2018-08-18 15:50:51 “Trump wrongly said that Hillary Clinton “gave” Russia 20%…Clinton was one of nine votes approving the deal. She alone couldn’t have stopped the deal, which involved 20 percent of U.S. production capacity, not stocks, and the uranium can’t go to Russia without export licenses.”
1653 2018-08-18 15:48:26 You mean how out of favor sentiment was then vs now? Must’ve been more extreme then when the crisis was so recent, but seems like saying stocks can’t be out of favor unless they’re out of favor like March 2009.

1671 2018-08-18 15:33:05 Banks ,  Small/ medium / Fortune 500 Companies , Health Insurance Companies , Exchanges ( stocks / crypto ) all rely upon and run their businesses utilizing computers networks - which are vulnerable. Damage is occurring and will continue to worsen.
1672 2018-08-18 15:32:27 Universal background checks.  No private sales w/o background checks. Ownership at the legal drinking age at least for all handguns.  Restrictions on rapid firing weapons and tools such as bump stocks. Yearly licensing.  Proficiency exams .
1673 2018-08-18 15:32:14 Gov't could not stop 64,000 from dying from drugs they control/ban, BUT they can stop people from owning bump stocks and magazine that hold more than 5 rounds. The disconnect from reality is astounding.
1674 2018-08-18 15:30:35 Is he trying to tank it on purpose so he can try to buy back more stocks cheaper? Isn’t he being investigated by the SEC?
1675 2018-08-18 15:30:20 Rule 1: Stop listening to professionals. 20 years in the business convinces me that any normal person using 3% of the brain can pick stocks just as well, if not better, than an average Wall Street expert.

1729 2018-08-18 14:49:54 A early announcement for a game you know you can't make the deadline for is good for our stocks.

1734 2018-08-18 14:46:06 It’s simpler to explain with stocks. At the end of the month take a bunch of characteristics of all stocks (their momentum, P/E ratios, etc). Standardize them. Then regress those characteristics vs the next months returns. Then you see which characteristics = outperformance

1748 2018-08-18 14:38:40 I think depends on a lot. If you're a Long Term Investor in Quality Stocks with a diverse Portfolio I just don't see SL as particularly useful. If you're Active and move money around a lot then SL essential part perhaps.

1765 2018-08-18 14:22:59 Btw it's positive that you are buying the Kerala stocks.
People should not sell their kerala based stocks unless they need fund. Or traders should not short sell the stocks.

It will take some bold persons or a genius (maybe a little bit of both) to jump on that. That company is neck deep in losses. .

1801 2018-08-18 13:54:12 Exactly. Backpage was taken back with similar strategy. This Sec 230 move is an obvious one that I have to assume the white hats are prepping. These stocks are NOT long term holds.
1802 2018-08-18 13:52:51 Wow are we on the same planets here. Record low unemployment across the board. Wages are going up for the first time in years without a MANDATE Stocks continue to increase. 401k millionaires growing exponentially and that is just the beginning.
1803 2018-08-18 13:51:34 Considering that we've been USD up, US stocks up & gold down for 10 years in a row, Im very comfortable taking the precise opposite of the milkshake trade.
1804 2018-08-18 13:51:15 Management truly only cares about the numbers. Have a tech rerun those return-to-stocks every day for months if necessary!

1806 2018-08-18 13:49:59 The reaction towards Counsell is strikingly similar to Ned’s in 2008
1807 2018-08-18 13:49:22 To: @CNBC  There is a group called "shorts" who deliberately sell stocks to the detriment of companies...for profit.
1808 2018-08-18 13:47:57 Same here stocks, gold , real estate. However I do believe that $BTC and #crypto currencies are in its infant stage. Whether you trade or hold , I think in the future buying $BTC under 10K will be unheard of. Jmo

1811 2018-08-18 13:47:01 yes, thats what my point also was, to @kothariabhishek and @_anujsinghal , that why have these stocks fallen in a rising mkt and that to on a banknifty positive day.
1812 2018-08-18 13:46:43 Halibut stocks are in free fall, please stop serving this.
1813 2018-08-18 13:46:39 BTW I'm not sure I can vote but if I had I would have chosen 'Use Stoploss on Riskier Trades' - I think SL do have use and value but not on Great Stocks that I want to hold forever - then it makes no sense. If such a Stock has a problem in the business you can decide to sell.
1814 2018-08-18 13:46:21 Yeah, so investors are kept in the dark for 6 months, while insiders get the information and sell off stocks whose earnings miss the mark. Another gift to the rich! How does this help jobs????
1815 2018-08-18 13:46:02 To be fair, any balanced portfolio should have some pot stocks.  I'm not advocating an all in approach, but diversification is good. 

We probably saw similar activity at the end of Prohibition.
1816 2018-08-18 13:44:58 Wrong. You are pulling the rug out from the future economy by liquidating the stocks of natural resources at the base of it all! You’re not at all smart or informed about these things, and unfortunately, neither are your cabinet members.
1817 2018-08-18 13:44:34 You don’t need much more of a reason to diversify beyond large cap US stocks than this

1820 2018-08-18 13:41:58 just read it, it is indeed very good!
however, it should also say US stocks are the laggard in a bear turn that started where the real action had been and has so far devastated

1821 2018-08-18 13:41:57 Jake tapper doesn’t have to give a 1/3 of his paycheck to HC insurance,  he’s out of touch and has clear financial motives (stocks) to keep the status quo. He’s an entertainer not a reporter. He’s paid to spin information to favor millionaires and billionaires.
1822 2018-08-18 13:41:26 It staggers me how many hardline former police officers have now sold themselves out to the marijuana industry to vastly supplement their Police pensions. Stuns me more as to how many current senior officers are investing in pot stocks.
1823 2018-08-18 13:41:16 I also own dividend stocks, high quality equity names, some Gold, real estate and use largest portion of assets for swing trading in forex and futures.
1824 2018-08-18 13:40:34 The bottom 80% of Americans own only 7% of US stocks, and only 27% of the middle class, group between the poorest 20% and the richest 20% of Americans, owned more than $10k in stocks.  The top 10% like you and Bacon benefit, the rest of us pay for it

1829 2018-08-18 13:37:04 Do you have any idea what that would do to their stocks? Tens of millions of people would instantly shut down their accounts, then trump would go to another platform, like gab, and everyone would follow him, even if they are against him, so they could read his rantings & respond.
1830 2018-08-18 13:36:19 Yes on Investments, Real Estate, Stocks and Bonds. Also hospitals and other business endeavors. Additionally, ministers and other church employees should pay income taxes.
1831 2018-08-18 13:34:53 I have heard the same stories many times before in my 43 years speculating: Gold, Silver, art, antique cars, dividend stocks, rental real estate -- should I go on.
1832 2018-08-18 13:34:00 Hey bro, sorry for the question but what is the reason you got long? fundamentals?  I have got long several times in the same location/pattern and on similar stocks before but mostly got smoked.

1835 2018-08-18 13:31:42 La publication des résultats trimestriel pour les entreprises cotées est une hérésie qui conduit les dirigeants à ne piloter que le cours de l’action et leurs stocks options. Le capitalisme familial ne subit pas cette dictature.
1836 2018-08-18 13:31:05 Index funds do have a strong momentum bias, especially when you take into account stocks entries and exits as well. Most strategies, quality or value or momentum, will do better than the market over time but it is the intermittent period that is very painful for investors.

1838 2018-08-18 13:29:58 .@jonlovett In case you're wondering, the real Kompromat is that Russia gave trump info (via Saudis) pre-9/11 that allowed him to buy/sell specific real estate/stocks. Rather than warn anyone about the terrorist plot, he used to info to make a fortune.

1840 2018-08-18 13:26:27 Long Strangle on Dewan Housing

Buy 680 CE @ 17-18
Buy 660 PE @ 14

Target can be 40 on either side 

Stop loss can be 15 on combined contraction

Logic: Stock at near 52 weeks high.
         It can move up or down in the near term
1841 2018-08-18 13:25:02 Mostly stocks are in x, xt, or gsm stage , low vol...other than this few are good ones, rest might b good, but strict norms of sebi might b a dempner to trade in these stocks

1883 2018-08-18 12:46:38 I do remember $WMT being the only green Dow stock in 2008, for this exact reason. But lot of retail stocks have also been screaming higher... $WMT was lagging bigly before this report.
1884 2018-08-18 12:43:43 Also just for the record on June 22 on CNBC AWAAZ you made a comment weak stocks like Srf should be avoided. That day Srf was at 1691 and was down 90... Fast forward today and you can check for yourself how weak SRF is. I don't mind holding weak stocks that return 20% in 2 months

2080 2018-08-18 08:32:10 Elon Musk's strategy seems to be to create a better universe in his mind. Then he envisions that he already lives in it and tries to construct a path from the present one. Powerful strategy for a visionary, dangerous when you slip up and talk about stocks.

2093 2018-08-18 08:09:03 That seems to be the game. But why people can't find healthy companies that have good prospects and are undervalued to invest me is beyond me. Laziness/greed I guess. The Wolf of Wall Street guy started off selling penny stocks, people eventually realise they are bad.

2094 2018-08-18 08:07:48 I advise you to do research on climate change before you comment on it. In 1922  Capt.

2122 2018-08-18 07:15:31 Rich people own assets that constantly earn them money. Like online stores that get orders 24/7, or stocks that go up in value without any effort. That’s the difference between a millionaire and a billionaire. Billionaires make money in their sleep.

2124 2018-08-18 07:12:08 Always remember most of these companies are advertising and retail based. In a recession advertising is the first budget that gets slashed.

2166 2018-08-18 06:14:57 Word to the wise. 

Focus on which Tory MPs own which stocks and them correlate where they have changed laws to profiteer.

They are corrupt to the very core.

Expose this corruption and the next election won't even be close.
2167 2018-08-18 06:13:23 Mr. Schwartz, do you have an opinion about stocks up here? Tech stocks looking a bit frothy, no?
2168 2018-08-18 06:12:36 Honestly just try out 3 stocks 5 minutes for games. Matches get over fast but it's perfect for bo5.
2169 2018-08-18 06:12:21 China VSF prices were largely stable, seeing central prices for medium-end and high-end #Viscose Staple #Fiber. Downstream mills mainly digested their stocks and bought fresh materials in small lots.
2170 2018-08-18 06:10:10 Why current market highs are not being celebrated like in past? 

Of 2821 fairly liquid stock,
1809 have lost one-third value from highs.
Thus,  out of every 100 stocks,  64 are down atleast 33%.

2183 2018-08-18 05:40:41 Basically, buy short term treasury bills now cause yields are high. Stocks are low too. Lots of distress sales at the moment so for long term investments, you can buy corporate shares and wait.

2225 2018-08-18 04:47:08 Thats right, his strategy is working with low floates, only. And it is not for everyone, especially not for beginners. To trade those stocks you  need much more technical skills than trading mid or big cap stocks.

And over time, August and September have been the worst two months for equity market returns.

2265 2018-08-18 03:50:40 First off more people were killed with a truck in France. Second off I am sure you have not, and I certainly have not, read the final report which states a bump stock was used. Bump stocks are inaccurate. Lastly you can fire as fast without one.
2266 2018-08-18 03:50:28 Assault weapon ban, ban bump stocks, 5Rd mags limit, every gun registered, failure to do so get a felony record, more gun free zones, no open carry or concealed carry, this will save lives!

Bump stocks are a gimmick and useless.

2302 2018-08-18 03:09:45 Any truth to story that the real Kompromat is that Russia gave trump info (via Saudis) pre-9/11 that allowed him to buy/sell specific real estate/stocks? That he made a fortune rather than warn anyone about the terrorists plans?
2303 2018-08-18 03:05:03 No, It's not a Profit & Loss Acct. Expenses are not exclusively for that period. Opening/ closing levels of stocks, debtors, creditors are not accounted. Depreciation/ provisions not accounted. Its only a Receipt & Payment  statement. Interpreting the deficit as a loss is wrong.

2316 2018-08-18 02:57:27 But Right now we have rising rates, rising usd and rising stocks? So u are saying this is for the short term and somethings got to give? Thanks for your insights!
2317 2018-08-18 02:55:40 Nothing much for China but US businesses that rely on cheap  manufacturing in China would be crippled, e.g. Apple. US consumers would  face much higher costs for their products. China may sell its $1tln+ in USTs driving yields higher. Stocks would crash everywhere.
2318 2018-08-18 02:54:43 Yes.  But Fed printing will weaken USD.  This is why Us can have 2 of 3 of rising rates, rising USD, rising stocks
2319 2018-08-18 02:53:34 It's getting late in the current economic cycle.
Investing in the stock market is getting ''normal'' and the public choose the leading stocks as their main strategy.
When they can't stop winning, that's when euphoria gets in and that's when the bubble is the most likely to pop.
2320 2018-08-18 02:52:17 That is the ROI on the move of the stocks, however you can achieve a much higher ROI with options, which is what most of our traders do
2321 2018-08-18 02:50:51 With Apple stocks, there *is* something the gov't can do about it.

They can go to Apple leadership or whatever, and tell them look, from now on the previous on-chain token is no longer Apple stock. Now this new one is, and we rolled back the thefts on the new one.

2438 2018-08-18 00:57:57 Not a good idea little buddy. Sorry. With all the manipulation and corruption in the business sectors a change like that may actually be terrible in the stocks. Leaves too much room for mistakes to be made and not fixed at a decent time which leads to lower stocks from the....
2439 2018-08-18 00:55:33 Warner brothers (the record label) has sold their stocks in Spotify for 500 mil. Artist have been given ZERO, 125 million has been set aside for them IF, IF warner bros has recouped. This is why you favorite rappers are behind the scenes, truly... broke. Business is bad
2440 2018-08-18 00:55:16 Yeah I was just curious how you determine which charts to review. I need to come up with a strategy on how to determine which stocks I want to study, but I don’t know how to figure out what is best.
2441 2018-08-18 00:54:07 But then wall street can only trash stocks twice a year when they report better than expected earnings/forecasts, how can they scam everyone's IRAs/ investments with just two announcements. Average earnings growth this year is 25%, wonder who keeps shorting/selling?, Theories?
2442 2018-08-18 00:51:23 Elon musk is now being probed by SEC after his tweet 2 weeks ago that obviously made him a lil richer in stock, same stocks are falling now!
2443 2018-08-18 00:48:14 Beg to differ as a self-directed trader. It should be folded into the News app. Stocks app is redundant because no one can actually perform trades in Stocks and have to use own brokerage account/app anyway.

2445 2018-08-18 00:43:08 Musket is true. I never called them a threat now since they are regulated. But automation is capable of much more harm which is why it should stay heavily regulated and bump stocks should as well.

However, my rule is to invest only in top-quality, largely non-cyclical growth stocks that have a predictable high rate of earnings and, hopefully, dividend growth. I believe that if you keep this in mind, you will stay on track.”

2480 2018-08-18 00:11:07 How about this? We can afford to get rid of quarterly reporting only if we abolish Reg FD. But if both were in force? Stocks would be nothing but giant gaps,both ways, twice a year. All that would do is push even more money to passive products.
2481 2018-08-18 00:09:21 when more rare stocks?
2482 2018-08-18 00:06:46 I thought that the MSM “journalists” were going to connect the dots between the Vegas shooter and the fact that Saudi military uses bump stocks. Nope. The MSM is still lost in the woods.

2486 2018-08-18 00:00:01 Yeah and I’m not saying stocks don’t move either they just are in general slower during summer. Slower, lower volume. SPY volume in the summer can be super low
2487 2018-08-17 23:59:18 Yeah I started using it last year. I made like $20 in one whole year. It was my first time playing with stocks and I had got 5 shares with some small dumb company lol
2488 2018-08-17 23:58:50 Just bought all the stocks I could in fence companies. I hope it's at least 20 feet high!
2489 2018-08-17 23:58:40 Agreed. When a mutual fund holds say 80+ stocks, it's nearly statistically impossible to not in turn be a closet indexer. And yet, most funds are indeed that diversified. Which to your point is arguably due to the concern of "career risk" by the manager.
2490 2018-08-17 23:56:19 i prefer stocks to be green when i look for puts, i know its also unpopular to talk about making downside trades,, but i am here to make money not hold somebody's hand.

2529 2018-08-17 23:29:47 Ok. I know I may have scoffed at you two weeks ago when talking about stocks just because stocks are so volatile and not really ideal for stable growth, but I’m going to investigate Monday.

2553 2018-08-17 23:09:55 I don't bealive you can really get wealthy from nothing with stocks, maybe just a few. But I sure know you can get wealthier in stocks if you already have wealth.
2554 2018-08-17 23:09:17 Completely agree, stocks are not my game either.
2555 2018-08-17 23:08:21 They should always be honored. I went a few weeks back, They got 2 laps into the first feature (Street Stocks?) And it wasn't honored. I was really unhappy.

2559 2018-08-17 23:04:19 Algorithms are used to solve those scary equations in math class. Its comprised of steps, decisions and rules. Computer programs use similar processes to pick and trade stocks.
2560 2018-08-17 23:02:53 People take crypto for granted.... I look at normal stocks and omg... The gains are so small within the crypto gain time frame... I would not have any patience in stocks. Thats like buying and then forgetting about it for years. Many many years.

2564 2018-08-17 23:01:50 Why did our stocks plunge because of a crisis in Turkey? Is the crisis in Turkey, Wall Streets Mercury in retrograde?

2568 2018-08-17 22:53:58 To start with, eToro is nice for lazy armchair trading regarding stocks. I bought the Xiaomi IPO a few weeks ago there cause exchanges in Germany couldn’t list it so far. HOWEVER regarding crypto there is no bigger scam show out there like this! You can buy Neo but don’t get 1/
2569 2018-08-17 22:51:08 Your reply was fed’s intervention so i figured you meant QT. 

But, you do know looong time ago Fed QE helped stock prices, and this year, since Fed QT started, wasn’t supposed to be beneficial to stocks as QT is rolling assets aka stocks off their balance sheet so Fed raises $?

2584 2018-08-17 22:39:54 I agree. Same for bump stocks, assault weapons, creationism, blurry church/state lines, fraud, treason, blantant lying and pablum Senators with no true regard for their Nation’s Constitution or it’s people.
2585 2018-08-17 22:38:52 Is this not the perfect reason to open a taxable account and start blindly speculating on individual stocks??

2588 2018-08-17 22:33:45 EPI latest figures show USA execs earn 312 times the average worker's pay.This is even without taking account of their dividends/bank interest/stocks etc. So one individual has the income & power of *hundreds* of their minions combined. When was slavery abolished?
2589 2018-08-17 22:33:38 Wonder how his coat hanger stocks are doing?
2590 2018-08-17 22:32:46 Why the hell should I be scared of a picture? Stop blaming the generalization game( you can do better). Also, bump stocks are banned in some states so what exactly is your issue?

2605 2018-08-17 22:19:21 The President who hasn’t released his tax returns doesn’t believe in extra transparency.

2624 2018-08-17 22:02:11 Stocks tend to get pinned to strike prices with heavy open interest on options expiration day.
Market makers unwind (or add to) their delta hedges to keep a stock at a strike to avoid exercise.

2627 2018-08-17 22:01:38 You're stating your point. I'm stating mine. You say I'm bashing your point. And here you are bashing mine. As with anything in stocks it's all opinions right? I don't get why people in your group get so butt hurt about people stating their own opinion

2631 2018-08-17 21:53:15 Have you noticed we the people can send newly elected representatives to Washington and within two years their millionaires. How is this possible? Insider information on government contracts, stocks, bonds, and interest rates. Another get rich scheme is fake personal loans.

2639 2018-08-17 21:41:18 You should check how much the stocks rose under Obama's first yr....hint, it was more than trumpy.
2640 2018-08-17 21:38:37 I guess there is no need to review and discuss how to mitigate these concerns. We all know how the escaped fish story ends. Bad news for wild stocks.

2642 2018-08-17 21:37:39 Fack check that any economic growth during the Obama administration was due to him overspending $10 trillion and averaging 1.9% GDP for 8 years. 3rd quarter 2016 worst in 2 yrs. Stocks dropping 900 right before election. World thought Hillary would win continue Obama economics.

2667 2018-08-17 21:25:00 And therein lies the rub. It’s impossible to report on Musk (as it is with Trump) without someone saying “Aha! But you are the press! you lie!” 

If you work in the media, you don’t do it to get rich on stocks… or to cause chaos. You do it to try and explain what’s going on.
2668 2018-08-17 21:24:41 They banned bump stocks & automatic weapons. Good for them. Far cry from “gun confiscation.” Infact, it’s those of your ilk that labeled it that.

Maybe do investing simulations with twitch chat? It’s interesting and fun to learn.
2675 2018-08-17 21:17:26 Millennials:  time to embrace old fried true and trusted stocks -- your parents have used for decades. Ditch concept stocks with no earnings. Their bull market is history in my view.  If $NVDA doesn't prove that don't know what will.

2687 2018-08-17 21:09:07 @EssendonFC Disappointing result last night. Although there are a few positives that have come from season 2018, at the end of the day we're here to win premierships. Need to look for a classy inside/outside mid, we also need to look at replenishing our tall fwd stocks.
2688 2018-08-17 21:08:36 Welcome to the propaganda Channel, on Today Show we ignore that we've increase the deficit gave tax breaks to corporations in the 1% that's fueling the stock market buy back of stocks and that real wages have gone down.

2691 2018-08-17 21:08:02 My savings go into stocks. I’ll be damned if I put my savings into those rigged savings accounts from big banks when inflation increases 3%/year. I’m getting a rate of return at 0.01%-0.03% annually. Okay so the value of my money is decreasing by 0.29%-0.27% Haha shiddd

Most people live essentially as wage slaves... and if they are lucky the company has some sort of 401k retirement system.

2723 2018-08-17 20:56:48 If [in the US or any capitalist country including Denmark] a firm has 100 stock owners who also are employees & all employees/owners own one stock each, that's market socialism alright. I think this is true if 51% of the employees own 51% of the stocks. @interfluidity @asymptosis
2724 2018-08-17 20:56:40 Which can only mean FANG stocks go higher and gold goes lower?

2772 2018-08-17 20:26:20 Well the original stocks that they used for projection were very low resolution compared with modern film stocks, so it’s not just a 1:1 transfer. Also some of the early color processes used dyes hand-stenciled onto B&H print stock, so also the colors are not a 1:1 either.
2773 2018-08-17 20:26:09 Callum's right - they're an important indicator to the health of our rivers. Given the state of those stocks (see pics) what does that tell you about the state of our rivers, and who is responsible for their health? See why it's all a bit frustrating?
2774 2018-08-17 20:26:03 When stocks go down after companies miss earnings, it's often not about the earning miss, but rather implications on their long term targets/strategies. The long term is made up of a series of short terms.
2775 2018-08-17 20:25:48 Maybe y'all should tax me? Capital gains taxes are at historic lows and the GOP wants to make them even lower!! Buying stocks and watching CNBC is getting boring though. But my goodness I make so much doing nothing can you blame me? Maybe I'll invest in the weed biz??

2784 2018-08-17 20:19:51 I think the problem of quarterly earnings and "shorterm-ism" in corporate america is cliche and overstated. Just look at $AMZN $NFLX and many other growth stocks.  Investors are plenty patient and often look out a decade or more.
2785 2018-08-17 20:19:19 The quarterly reporting is not the problem, the culture of short term gain is. The price of the stock matters more than the underlying plan. The massive bubble in U.S. stocks, proof of that culture, will be an implosion you will be able to see from Jupiter. #trumpRegrets

2794 2018-08-17 20:13:20 In my humble opinion the reasons behind this are both ghastly and simple: Each of these people has accepted tainted money&help, been allowed to ‘buy’ stocks in Rosnef, have had sexual congress with their spies and like kleptocracy as long as they are in the controlling group.
2795 2018-08-17 20:13:18 Bots are also in traditional markets. And i don't see any specific stock controlling other stocks.

2798 2018-08-17 20:12:04 Trump has never been a very big player in Stocks. He doesn't know what he is talking about most the time@cnn
2799 2018-08-17 20:08:52 Longing bonds and awaiting for a break here, will create nice drop in stocks. Just curious what will be a root cause of that. Interest rates have peaked, oil has peaked, inflation is turning down. No way 10Y will go > 3.12% anymore ... low 1.00% or 0.00% is coming.
2800 2018-08-17 20:08:33 Elon Musk is cool now because he used Twitter shitposting to manipulate stocks, which is the highest possible level of being online that there is
2801 2018-08-17 20:08:24 To wack jobs in a picture. Do you two even realize what embarrassments you are? Two laughing stocks.
2802 2018-08-17 20:08:09 It's a big world out there. Lotta stocks. Lotta money. Lotta participants. Plenty of room for everyone to be professional, happy, and profitable. Hope everyone has a great weekend, focus more on getting better, less on negativity and bashing, and it's all up from there!
2803 2018-08-17 20:08:07 $WEED with the absolute face melter close  $VFF she's alive again! Unreal close to the week for weed stocks. Legalization about 60 days and counting - can't come soon enough

2808 2018-08-17 20:05:18 Got the timing wrong in my previous (deleted) tweet. I went back to school to get my tech training in the late 90s (after college). then started trading stocks, then thought I was going to be a trading millionaire, then lost everything in stocks, then went back to IT...
2809 2018-08-17 20:04:25 @elonmusk, creating controlled chaos to lower stock prices to make it easier for himself to buy back public stocks & take @Tesla private.

2811 2018-08-17 20:04:09 Elon Musk could sneeze and Tesla stocks would crumble.

2820 2018-08-17 19:59:59 Those are the chumps that act like knowitalls 
  This is my 1st year in crypto (since Aug 2017)  and I ain't going nowhere.   15+ years of trading/investing in stocks and options set me up beautifully for this world known crypto.   95% of crypto are clueless sheep
2821 2018-08-17 19:59:57 Any sign of a Peated port making a reappearance, stocks are running low!
2822 2018-08-17 19:57:48 I use to hold stocks for years, and play with options. I hope to sell TSLA in 4 years, because I do have plans for this specific date. I think in four years the stock might be surpassing 1k. If conditions change, then I might steer. So far so good. Let’s see.
2823 2018-08-17 19:56:14 If U don't own stocks or have side income/business (rental, Airbnb, taxi, something" you're "Working for Money" Money is NOT working for you!
2824 2018-08-17 19:56:02 True that! If history repeats itself , we gotta see some pullback before heading into in fall Run. I don't believe this is the much anticipated run.  Other pot stocks no way close to bein BULL compared to $WEED
2825 2018-08-17 19:55:37 Speaking of horror stories, I could share some. I literally have made & lost hundreds of thousands of dollars TWICE in my life. First, when I was a kid in the late 90s/early 2000s dot-com days & then again a few yrs after I came back to stocks in March 2009. Learned a lot though!

2830 2018-08-17 19:50:23 Not a day trader, to me that's someone who sits, looks at charts & trades dozens of times a day. I swing trade stocks/options. Hold them anywhere from a few days to a few months. Started out as a hobby, while I had my own business, then eventually replaced my income few yrs ago..
2831 2018-08-17 19:49:46 Tesla stocks would rise if Elon Musk let each of his stock holders shoot him with a paintball gun.

2846 2018-08-17 19:45:32 Wow, how complicated does it get?? I thought anybody can buy shares in a business that sells stocks. Private or public. I didn't know there really was a difference. Who are considered the smaller group? Aren't they public?

2851 2018-08-17 19:42:17 Earnings reports are not so much about transparency but rather comparing P&L's and profit margins with wall street analysts' outlooks and guidance expectations. Stocks move solely based on how numbers compare to outside forecasts. Look at NVDA before and after earnings report.
2852 2018-08-17 19:41:03 Stocks enter the final 20 mins trading at session highs, with the S&P 500 sporting a gainer of 0.3%.

2853 2018-08-17 19:40:48 Now I love options & supplement my trading income w/them. There's a learning curve & you must know what you're doing, but it can be the safest thing you do in investing (like selling covered calls on stocks you intent to keep for a long time). Shorting using options can be scary.
2854 2018-08-17 19:40:41 Fang stocks not strong enough check back next week.

I have to teach myself options though....I have been too scared to go through the learning curve after reading a lot of horror stories about shorting stocks

2863 2018-08-17 19:32:52 Yeah, looking over my stocks, I've used that strategy on all of them, including initially getting into $AAPL when it was about $80 prior to the 7-for-1 split in 2014... unfortunately back then I was inexperienced (err... dumb) and just gambled on the options instead of the stock.
2864 2018-08-17 19:32:10 It is also ridiculous that we cannot keep close watch of our own stock holdings. Overseas stock exchanges report every 3 months too....but usa has the most stocks. Pls dont mess it up for us.
2865 2018-08-17 19:29:26 They are utilizing monopoly control over the way in which we communicate-associate-make personal investments/stocks etc. to pretend we gave up our Rights just to function within a society they've engineered as a technological prison.

2873 2018-08-17 19:25:20 Elon musk said he hated people shorting teams stocks. Ironic his tweet about buying it back at $420 (to illegally cost shortest millions) caused it's price to fall.

2922 2018-08-17 18:59:55 I wish someone would ask them how much they have made off their Stocks and Bonds, Real Estate etc. since President Trump  took over?

2925 2018-08-17 18:58:58 To be clear, I've enjoyed vast majority of my personal interactions with short sellers of many stocks over the years. Some maybe bad actors, but most are geeks of different sort & bring needed skepticism to the markets. Also, unlike longs, shorts *have* to eventually buy a stock.

2945 2018-08-17 18:42:38 Cup and Handle - It’s an ok pattern but like anything it’s not foolproof. I had perfect Stocks in this pattern only to nosedive. I use 7-15 Keys  and then decide to buy a new stock or sell ones I already own.

3053 2018-08-17 17:45:41 $arci watching to see how long it bounces around a few cents below the average purchase price on #RobinHoodapp I think I might be onto something. The idea is to invest in stocks that are at least 10% below their average #robinhood cost.

3073 2018-08-17 17:36:03 It's no wonder why millennials flock to $crypto. Minimum investment balances are far out of reach for the younger generation. Want to trade stocks? That'll require $25,000 in capital plus fees.  Want to buy some $crypto? Cool, give me what you can.

3086 2018-08-17 17:30:00 I haven't tweeted a lot about my #stocks recently. This is mostly due to the fact that I haven't trade anything the last few months due to a negative market segment.
3087 2018-08-17 17:29:57 Whomever is responsible for the  violin elevator version of Can You Feel the Love Tonight for their hold music should be put in stocks and flogged.
3088 2018-08-17 17:29:57 Be careful loading any fang stocks people weekly chart still got plenty room lower. $nflx $fb look super week I think 295 and 160 possible.

3090 2018-08-17 17:29:31 But you promised to make America great again. And here we are. People losing jobs, stocks are declining, people think it's ok to be racist again. Where is this booming economy? Who did you pay to display good statistics? Cuz I don't see any improvement. Neither do most of us.
3091 2018-08-17 17:29:23 Was looking for a specific reasons $DRNA was higher vs. $MGEN.  Not sure what those other stocks have to do with these RNAi plays.  I wouldn’t ever suggest $DRNA as comfortable easy money.
3092 2018-08-17 17:29:20 @HalftimeReport @larrykudlowCNBC @kevinolearytv Your chart does indicate that U.S. Stocks are way better than the global stocks. Global Stocks has no yield now or six months from now. @MelissaLeeCNBC @PeteNejarian @JimCramer
3093 2018-08-17 17:29:01 To those holding sizable portfolios of stocks. Sell now, reduce exposure to less than 25% equities. The fall is coming !
3094 2018-08-17 17:26:54 Sounds like this is just a scam to keep their stocks from dipping so often from bad earnings reports.
3095 2018-08-17 17:25:46 Isn't there a reason it's one of the most heavily shorted stocks? A lot of people think it's unsustainable.

3097 2018-08-17 17:23:34 I'm starting to think that there shouldn't just be divestment from fossil fuel company stocks, they should be delisted. Or are we really fine with a continuation of profit by destruction?

Oh wait, we clearly are, for the most part. :/
3098 2018-08-17 17:23:20 I would say that summers are definitely slow for the med to large cap stocks due to vacation, but it kind of puzzles me why penny stocks go into hiding too, there really isn't much big money action in penny stocks its mostly small traders
3099 2018-08-17 17:22:59 I won't say I've read all the books, but I've read a lot of them! I studied as much as I could after law school, and started doing my own investing in 2013. Mostly buying and selling stocks. Some long holds, some quicker sells. Average rate of return over the last 5 years is 23%.
3100 2018-08-17 17:21:59 CNBC never warns people to sell stocks until it's too late....

3103 2018-08-17 17:20:31 Sir am I on the right track not exactly a technical guy myself just an observation. Sir isn’t actually trade war good for our old economy stocks as it keeps commodities and rates in check. Sir what do u suggest?

3105 2018-08-17 17:19:33 It is worst than that: many if the writers in the "tech" blogosphere have Tesla stocks without systematically disclosing it!! $TSLAQ #Tesla
3106 2018-08-17 17:19:12 Corporations buy back stocks because it increases shareholder value which they are mandated to do. Audited P&L statement quantifies this. Dispensing wages reduces shareholder value. Congress passed laws ensuring this would happen - it did not used to be this way.
3107 2018-08-17 17:19:06 Oh God no please tell me no!
3108 2018-08-17 17:18:29 Quarterly reporting versus  semi annual reporting debate is not too meaningful today with Rule FD and SEC  K filings... another debate bone to chew up air TV time.

3114 2018-08-17 17:16:22 My broader view is buy what’s cheap to fundamentals irrespective of the growth rate, P/B, or market environment. But I think we can ask why stocks traditionally labeled growth have outperformed without the need to determine if they did actually outperform (because they did).
3115 2018-08-17 17:15:28 Are there any decent bulletin boards for US/TSX stocks?
3116 2018-08-17 17:14:19 Just sold my position in $TWTR . It was the only stock I own that wasn’t near ATH. With the cash I bought more shares of the stocks I already own . Portf : 21% $ROKU 21% $NTNX 20% $YEXT 16% $ETSY 11% $PVTL 11% $TWLO . Good fundamentals in all these companies .
3117 2018-08-17 17:13:19 So much fuss about short termism. It´s simple if companies report 4 times a year we will have 4 opportunities to speculate on stocks with smaller moves. If we get 2 or even only 1 earnings report we´ll have 1 or 2 mammoth repricing moves on stocks. Smart money won´t change at all

3120 2018-08-17 17:09:31 I would call that a flagrant conflict of interest. Like having retired military on TV "news" who own large sums of weapons maker stocks. Might as well have logos for BAE Systems, Lockheed-Martin - it would be more honest
3121 2018-08-17 17:09:22 Well said. However, having more employees and then paying them more on top of that takes money out of CEOs' pockets. We all know they don't like that. It's all about stocks and shareholders, not employees or supply and demand.
3122 2018-08-17 17:09:13 Funny how the penny stock gurus are all talking about mid cap stocks now , wonder where they got that from .

3123 2018-08-17 17:08:18 To your point Andrey, total grain carry over is projected by the USDA to be down 4.85mmt year over year, but with a near 6mmt grain carry over is this enough to keep stocks adequate? Curious as to your opinion as well as wheat export expectations.

3125 2018-08-17 17:07:10 Have reset my energy portfolio to mimic holdings in July 2017.  Currently holding just 2 stocks, having traded out of other positions to capture gains, and re-invest during this wash-out. No longer hold any WCS production, instead increased Brent exposure.

3129 2018-08-17 17:04:30 Quarter reports force the management to spend less time for planning products.
Twice a year is reasonable. For stock trading, quarter reports increase stocks volatility and the numbers of trades thus benefiting trade platforms such as Etrade etc..
3130 2018-08-17 17:04:30 The Fed govt. has an annual AIS budget close to $19 million. The recent announcement of $158,000 for the Okanagan is welcome but not enough. Invasive mussels could cause a collapse of Pacific salmon stocks from habitat loss. I support @OkWaterWise calls for $2M in annual funding.
3131 2018-08-17 17:04:02 My portfolio is terrible too, but you may sell too early when stocks rebound. We should be calm.
3132 2018-08-17 17:03:58 I see stocks have 5ma cross 10ma on 30 minutes chart are:

3137 2018-08-17 17:01:29 This bullishness won’t last forever, there is too much money and the stocks are at astronomical valuations world over. Just coz of quality they are paying 80 and a 100 PE. Nothing can last at this high level.
3138 2018-08-17 17:00:28 What cryptocurrencies managed to do is revolutionize the idea of investing & trading.

They are nothing more than stocks of a different kind.

But they are also easier to buy & trade.

That's the true value of #crypto. 

They allow common people to realize the power of investing.

3164 2018-08-17 16:51:35 I have been hitting stocks in the 10-30 range. Great spreads on these stocks.
3165 2018-08-17 16:51:16 Twitter, FB, YouTube the MSM and many others have openly declared war against conservative Americans. They aren’t even trying to hide it. The only way to take these companies/people down is for the American people to stand up and say that’s enough. We need to crash their stocks.
3166 2018-08-17 16:50:39 Our stocks are doing awesome under Trump. They did very badly under Obama! Plus, there are more trucks on our freeways than under Obama; a great sign the economy is doing well!
3167 2018-08-17 16:49:26 Answer,- see $FB $TSLA $NVDA, and others.  Years of 'EASY MONEY' has made market comfortable/complacent They trade within that comfort - usually precedes a deep market correction or crash. QE has distorted markets to the point very few pick stocks for long-term
3168 2018-08-17 16:48:50 $NVDA Nvidia still at 29x Forward EBITDA! Crazy for a business that has just lost a growth leg (crypto). Very promising short. #stocks
3169 2018-08-17 16:48:48 Its ok to have different opinions on stocks and medicin. You don’t have to go Ad hominem on every body who disagrees with you.
3170 2018-08-17 16:48:28 Have to keep in mind, how many times has it been overbought and keep going?  This is the most dangerous time for stocks like NFLX because ppl have been conditioned to think they just go up.  CSCO and INTC still haven’t gotten back to their dot com highs.
3171 2018-08-17 16:47:11 stocks are like wives . You can be wrong most of the time but end up winning in the end.Stay strong build that confidence
3172 2018-08-17 16:46:29 I guess I didn't mean for my point to be taken that only a few stocks are responsible this time around.  It just seems like there's an overlap of growth and momentum, which seem to have (almost by definition?) narrower participation than value...but i've been wrong before
3173 2018-08-17 16:44:40 have been pounding the table am short FAANG stocks.. nothing has changed.. damage to the charts too compelling

3177 2018-08-17 16:42:24 Need to sell meme stocks in stock photos as daily wire continues its genocide of classic jokes
3178 2018-08-17 16:41:53 Interesting! I am not a BitLicense expert. Where does it specify you can’t use the coins you took in custody for a second layer product? That happens everyday with classic securities like stocks and bonds. Banks create new money based on „my“ money I gave them.
3179 2018-08-17 16:40:26 The American school system really fails people by not having some sort of "adult finances" required course. 401ks, mortgages, stocks — these are all things adults have to deal with, but we're not given the education or opportunity to properly understand them.

3183 2018-08-17 16:37:43 Since Chinese Stocks is dirt cheap then I would recommend Mehmani to trade his India Cuisine restaurants for Chinese Stocks that has a currency yield of 2%.  for instance Starbucks has a pretty good yield holdings for Oppenheimer fund. @MelissaLeeCNBC @HalftimeReport
3184 2018-08-17 16:37:41 China stocks rise further on
3185 2018-08-17 16:37:30 Haven’t checked on my stocks in a min and just got paid in dividends and the Bitch went up. 
3186 2018-08-17 16:36:58 I didn't get out and I'm sorrier than ever. I wish i never got involved with VRING, FH and XSPA. If i can say hate, i hate everything about these stocks which essentially evolved from VRINGO. I lost alot of my 401k which as i look back now was soooo stupid. Hard lesson learned.
3187 2018-08-17 16:35:35 You should take a look at the Canadian experience. No quotas there and fish stocks collapsed much further than North sea stocks.
3188 2018-08-17 16:35:00 @Cattie42 yes. Short term fluctuation. Normal for low float stocks. Good luck
3189 2018-08-17 16:34:55 I'm  just saying that growth v value is not terribly significant in large cap stocks, but it seems like whenever growth has outperformed for any length of time, there was some kind of catch phrase describing a group of stocks.  Just an observation
3190 2018-08-17 16:33:57 Draw, write, workout, learn about/invest in stocks? I wish I could help for real though!
3191 2018-08-17 16:33:52 So these so called business leaders are expecting bad quarters? Hence, a bad look for you? This is a terrible idea for investors in determining whether to buy or sell their stocks. Investors need transparency.
3192 2018-08-17 16:33:40 And Dean Witter.  Socks and stocks strategy.
3193 2018-08-17 16:32:45 Do you own stocks that give quarterly guidance?
3194 2018-08-17 16:32:34 Let them feed our meat stocks with grain... no soy at all please!
3195 2018-08-17 16:31:28 Well, here's what you can do you disingenuous dolt:
1. Ban assault weapons 
2. Require background checks on ALL gun purchases
3. Ban bump stocks
4. Stop taking money from the NRA

3196 2018-08-17 16:30:38 Though I don’t think a low corporate tax rate is a silver bullet. Companies didn’t use their $1T tax break to raise wages or hire more. They rebought their own stocks and moved some 1s and 0s to increase their own personal wealth
3197 2018-08-17 16:30:16 Our thoughts are with our S2 player Ryan Stocks & his family today, on the sad news of his fathers passing. Everyone connected with E&K send our deepest condolences.
3198 2018-08-17 16:30:13 I dont even trade penny stocks. Not sure why I was put as the poster child of that. I'm a Quantitative Futures trader. To be called a penny stock  trader is defamation of character. ;) Also I do not photo shop P&L. But funny video.
3199 2018-08-17 16:29:15 Defensive stocks rally again.  There is Zero interest from anyone.  
They will get popular about when the coming recession is announced,  recommended widely by Financial advisors. 
Then I will sell mine.

3203 2018-08-17 16:25:14 It can go either way. Low supply of refined products may cause higher prices if demand is constant. On the other hand, stocks may build up if refineries not operating at full capacity & push prices down. It depends, as always. It's behind us but was a significant event.

3205 2018-08-17 16:24:09 But we’re forgetting the most important part. Almost all of these formats owe their existence to the inadequate single strip film stocks of the day. Technirama, Vistavision, The Panavision 70s and whatnot were all used as sources to create higher quality 35mm release prints
3206 2018-08-17 16:23:46 Thanks to President obama for handing you a good economy on the upswing. Funny how you take credit for everything. You will be blamed for tax cuts to the top only for them to buy back stocks and become richer. Wages are stagnant for those of us that actually work to make money.

3213 2018-08-17 16:21:11 My target $SPY 285 yesterday was purely for Options expiration, having nothing to do with the #ES_F trend. Today, they'll try one more time.

After today's OpEx, all bets are off. Sectors rotation to value stocks continue to hurt the FANG stocks. Hence, #ES_F going lower.
3214 2018-08-17 16:20:09 xly:xlp growth to value has turned down for months signaling growth stocks to sell off big in coming months.
3215 2018-08-17 16:19:22 When are the banks going to start asking Elon for the money they lent him to go out and buy more stocks?
3216 2018-08-17 16:18:49 Fed will probably buy up all the corporate debt, government debt, stocks/etf's. They'll do crazy, radical things, to create the illusion that all is well during future downturns.

3229 2018-08-17 16:13:08 The Arms Index or Short-Term Trading Index /TRIN/ is hovering at (1.12-1.21) for both the NASDAQ

3264 2018-08-17 16:00:50 Obama normalized the Castros who are notorious brutal dictators. Gave billions to Iran more brutal dictators. Democrats frequently engage in identity politics which gives home to racism. People who think like you should be laughing stocks but Groupthink makes you feel normal.
3265 2018-08-17 16:00:26 The problem is almost all American traded stocks are overvalued due to investment capital coming from all over the world looking for low risk. It's very difficult to figure out the real value of anything nowadays

3274 2018-08-17 15:54:29 When there are so many leading stocks set up that you don't have enough money to buy them all that is when the market is ready again. Right now lots of leaders in no mans land. Remain patient and risk small amounts until we get some steam.

3315 2018-08-17 15:36:35 if your holding period is 10 yrs or more u will most likely face atleast one 50% decline in some of your stock i.e. when the euphoria of an extreme bull market ends even the quality stocks too face quotational losses

3320 2018-08-17 15:34:48 You may want to have a look at Thor Industries in US.. it’s leading RV mnftr. Due to ongoing trade issues.. stocks have come down significantly.. my dcf value is 156$ and stock is trading at 93$. Not a pure auto play and also not multi bagger (hard to find in USA r8 now)..

3332 2018-08-17 15:30:14 Stocks should behave in a way we want them to do. If it doesn’t work that way, we should check our buy theory n go back to white board to find reasons. N rectify mistakes. Overall 50% route is not acceptable. It’s better to run n save rest of capital
3333 2018-08-17 15:30:05 (1) Does anybody else use the term "advanced biofuels" to refer exclusively to biofuels from stocks that do not compete with food stocks? Share a link? (2) For exotic advanced sourcing not competing with fuel stocks, is there even a single ongoing commercial flight?
3334 2018-08-17 15:28:26 I really wish Aurora were on, all the others are pumped to shit and are due for a couple big regressions (I'm holding cash for em rn). having had to slowly recoup the huge biomed losses I incurred, I recommend just playing the trendy stocks on the swing

3342 2018-08-17 15:25:33 Companies in the US have to report quarterly results, but management has more options to set expectations for any period, quarters to years, than ever before. Stocks and companies are judged and priced primarily on results versus yhose expectations
3343 2018-08-17 15:25:26 I agree with you 100%  There is so much "oversimplification" out there that does not tell the whole story. Some truth surrounded by alot of BS. Those stocks and dividends and RE just buy themselves for you and add to your portfolio? Or do you have to work for them?

3350 2018-08-17 15:23:41 Many investors sat out of stocks from 2009-2016, solely because of their dislike for President Obama's policies. Invest based on price, not politics!

3354 2018-08-17 15:22:08 I don’t have the capital to buy gold, but I do buy as much physical silver bullion as I can each year. I also bought some shares in 2 gold mining stocks. Is this sufficient? I plan to hold all of it long term.
3355 2018-08-17 15:22:00 You can also buy olive oil in aluminum cans, usually >1L in volume. It isn't widely available in Ireland though. Again with the Carlow plug, there's a stallholder at the farmer's market who stocks them (the oil is from Crete).
Any oil in cans or dark bottles keeps better!

3383 2018-08-17 15:10:07 A lot of pressure on the speculative stocks like $TSLA $NTNX $SNAP $DBX $NVDA as market strength rotates to the $DIA and $SPX. If that is a negative or a positive is anyones guess in this QE market.

3395 2018-08-17 15:05:21 Small caps beat to their own drum, based on their own fundamentals. However, they surge to high, unsustainable prices when too much money surges into small market cap market. The problem is that big investors all make a move for the door at the same time, destroying those stocks.

AND

2. Those that make a new high as soon as correction is done

3499 2018-08-17 14:19:13 The key to successful stock trading is not to pick stocks, but to let them pick you. You look at the market without opinion or judgement and you go where the setups are buying them in the order they emerge. This is how you avoid overthinking the process.

By wrapping MMT in eco speak of flows and stocks, horizontal, vertical and broad money, the man in the street is impressed by the language they don't know, and give MMT misplaced credibility
3540 2018-08-17 14:02:43 Truly absurd; overpaid CEOs complain quarterly reporting is hurting job growth/their ability to run the business.  Run it for long-term, not a quarter. Can give annual or semi-annual guidance or no guidance at all. FWIW, would make stocks less efficient, good for stock pickers.

3563 2018-08-17 13:55:16 Modern day stocks are less about investing in the efficacy of a given company and have morphed into money market checking accounts for high risk tolerances
3564 2018-08-17 13:55:04 Partly yes, although there is also the fact that their stocks (and therefore price) has increased very nicely since their last deal three years ago. Also add in slightly bigger names like Nic White, Cordero, Dennis, Cuthbert and Cordero.

Harder to maintain that same quality.

3572 2018-08-17 13:53:45 One quick&easy way to identify a slow market vs. a fast paced one: the price of the stocks in play.  Slower markets usually only have the $1-$2 junk in play.  They usually don't have enough range hence only 10-20c max possible win.  Faster markets we get $4-$5+ stocks =more range

3596 2018-08-17 13:43:42 I don't know... Wouldn't it make the public even less informed than they are now and thus insider trading more lucrative? Wouldn't it make stocks mor volatile around the semi-annual report dates?

3695 2018-08-17 12:53:30 Lessons I have learned from "blowing up" my last small account (cont'd): 9) When stocks are "spready" (10 cents or more); stay away from them or wait for the spread to tighten. Also when a stock has no or slow order flow do not trade it. If other's r not interested...y trade it?

3736 2018-08-17 12:34:33 Aug.16 (Dow Jones) -- Three years ago, a drop of less than 3% in the yuan against the dollar was enough to create panic among investors world-wide. The S&P 500 fell more than 10% within a few days, the usual definition of a correction, and global stocks plummeted.

3740 2018-08-17 12:30:10 I believe the issue is rooted in how stocks react after earnings.

Most are confused and think it’s rigged when their stock is up 15% one quarter but down 10% just three months later in the next quarter. All in a matter of minutes.

Now they think less reporting will fix that.

3805 2018-08-17 11:53:19 The best time to buy expensive stocks is when they are getting more expensive. Such stocks don’t get cheap unless the long term growth trend is broken - at which point you’d like to check out rather than check in. #TheThoughtfulInvestor

3806 2018-08-17 11:53:12 Catches from wild stocks have been vastly reduced over the last few years, ICES advice for 2019 suggests stocks have increased due to measures introduced
3807 2018-08-17 11:52:50 Yea, poor me and my $ROBO ETF.... I'm sleeping alright at night even though I don't 'own the stocks'

3809 2018-08-17 11:50:43 In other words, there's a business plan identifying revenue streams from immigrant detention. Don't forget, private prison stocks went up after either the election or the inauguration, maybe both, I found it alarming.
3810 2018-08-17 11:49:28 Seems crazy that we have to beg in Brussels to protect cod/bass/hake stocks from our own shores?
3811 2018-08-17 11:48:41 20 stocks in a portfolio means 2 things: There’s no true investment purpose or you don’t own the stocks because it’s an ETF.
3812 2018-08-17 11:48:19 Would be really interesting if 2019 was when metals and crypto turned up and #stocks went other way ahead of a possible downturn economy...1987, 1998, 2008 and...#Finance #commodities #crypto #cryptocurrency $GLD $SLV $BTC

3818 2018-08-17 11:45:07 Best time to buy high growth quality stocks is when they correct to 8 dma , then 20 dma and then if we get a chance the we have to add heavily at 50dma !! We get this chance rarely but we do get !!
3819 2018-08-17 11:43:20 And make it harder for the average investor to get reports on company performance to decide on stocks. 
Big guys will find a way. So you want more disparity that favors the wealthy.
3820 2018-08-17 11:43:20 Even better idea: Companies report ONLY when they are going to show positive results. This way all indexing BTFDer can just buy stocks every day and keep the PPT on the sidelines. BUY STOCKS EVERY DAY FOREVER!
3821 2018-08-17 11:42:51 Horrible idea... saves money because companies can fire off their accountants... Stocks won’t benefit because cost savings are offset by reduced transparency. Not smart!

3823 2018-08-17 11:41:10 That's what simple folks called trend followers do. And do it without losing hair & frothing in their mouth over  hair splitting valuation analysis . You are an excellent trend follower of high growth stocks 
3824 2018-08-17 11:40:38 Would you say the same about mining stocks?
3825 2018-08-17 11:40:34 Who needs reporting when you've got FED and friends, passive indexing w/ more ETFs than stocks, trillions in derivatives. Indexing is like a living wage for corporations.
3826 2018-08-17 11:39:34 I’d say Bower and Modi also saw their stocks go up

3839 2018-08-17 11:31:21 A 3-year CGT exemption would release huge stocks of housing to the market in that period.  Currently anyone wanting to rebalance their investments away from residential property loses nearly 30% of their capital in tax.  It's a big problem.
3840 2018-08-17 11:30:55 Here is my issue and why I’m still hopeful:  I have never seen a team announce their mercato is over like this... maybe I am wrong, but it is a coincidence that right after the announcement Lazio’s stocks rise again... not saying it’s happenning, just a tad curious.

3844 2018-08-17 11:27:39 A steep downturn in heavyweight Chinese internet stocks and recent weakness in half of the so-called FANG group have some investors worried that a key component of Wall Street's near-decade long rally may be low on fuel.

Communicate with your teammate. This one, while obvious, is still largely overlooked by most of the low-mid level players. Talk between sets, games, and stocks. If you need assistance make sure there is a way to let your teammate aware of it.

3890 2018-08-17 10:50:57 I do however use price alerts to find out when Mr. Market has decided to offer stocks at what I thought might be a more reasonable price. You can then check if that's still the case or if the reason it has got there is for a bad reason like a profits warning etc.

3928 2018-08-17 10:14:25 Hi, as checked, we highly suggest that you purchase the device directly via our Singtel Retail shops as we are not able to confirm on the stocks replenishment online at the moment as it depends on the manufacturer.
3929 2018-08-17 10:13:26 Forgetting to fire a blank would also be a concern. You wouldn’t want to shoot a live grenade that’s just in front of your face!

4417 2018-08-17 02:54:46 Can't understand what's the liquidity criteria for inclusion of stocks in futures segment. 
Some stocks don't have a single tick for several minutes together. 
Regular culprits are Suzlon & MRPL that have ticks for 250-300 mins out of 375. 
Worst is NHPC with <250 active mins.

4508 2018-08-17 01:50:51 There you go.  They don’t own stocks because they can’t afford to.  Not because of distrust in the system.  To be sure, they distrust it, but that’s not the reason they do town stocks.
4509 2018-08-17 01:49:48 I did not mean investing in stocks, financial mindset is understanding that work in time and money are all of the same value and that if you want to have a rich life, you must develop compounding skills that scale and learn how to do this in systems

4511 2018-08-17 01:49:15 But the effect of #Tencent’s struggles isn’t confined to China. Tech around the world saw their stocks fall, including U.S. chip makers. The reason: Everyone is looking to #China for growth, and if even a Beijing favorite can’t catch a break,why should anyone else expect to?

4513 2018-08-17 01:48:22 Is investing in stocks useful and if it is, what sources do you recommend to learn that? Is this talked about in your emails?
4514 2018-08-17 01:47:49 I think the reason a lot of people don’t own stocks is because financial literacy in the U.S. is terrible and people are living paycheck to paycheck because they’ve leveraged themselves up.

4527 2018-08-17 01:25:37 What most people think of as "money" isn't money. Fiat currencies are just currency but they are not money. As a result, most financially savvy people "save" a majority of their wealth by holding other assets such as real estate and stocks.

4536 2018-08-17 01:14:48 Oh yeah, the markets are really happy… They have a lot of D regulation so they don’t have to be responsible, and they’ve been given a whole crapload of money that they said they would invest in the middle class but they just really invested in their own stocks.
4537 2018-08-17 01:13:24 Man, I SDd under like 40 in both my losses again. It's seriously like 4 of my last 6 tourneys. I was playing awful and slumping, now I can feel that I'm playing well again, but I cannot stop SDing. I dislike taking credit from my opponents but I'm straight up taking my own stocks
4538 2018-08-17 01:12:12 There are also better companies than wall mart. Trade your own values and morals I know if your a good decent human being that can be hard sometimes on Wall Street and I’ve lost a lot of money over it, trading stocks that conflicted with my own ethics sometimes it’s hard.
4539 2018-08-17 01:09:13 Sounds good to me im in, "goes to store and stocks up on coffee bacon and blueberry pancake mix"
4540 2018-08-17 01:08:21 @VIZIO what exactly makes your smart TVs smart. There is a complete lack of apps no youtube no Hulu. I don’t need to check Facebook or stocks on my tv. Stay away from Vizio it’s a completely dishonest company
4541 2018-08-17 01:06:44 @enjoyGLOBE ubos na ba ang inyong mga LTE sim card replacements for Pre paid or ayaw nyo lang talaga magpalit? Last two years ko pa kasi naririnig sa lahat ng Globe stores nyo na either ubos na ang stocks ng LTE sim or may problema ang sistem etc...
4542 2018-08-17 01:04:32 @JulieChen WHAT!! Changing up the script... saying “shortly” instead of “soon enough”?!?!  #bb20
4543 2018-08-17 01:00:43 There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.  私たちの株式投資への意欲をそぐような要因がかなりある。１
4544 2018-08-17 01:00:30 Share you feelingsssss we have a lot of share in these stocks. Or whatever the phrase is, I’m not an investment banker

4547 2018-08-17 00:59:11 Rubbish. If you know anything about the economy Trump gave the top a massive tax cut and they used the money to buy back stocks which benefits them only. Stock buy backs are at record levels. Real wage growth is stagnated at 2.7% and is being eaten up by inflation at 2.8%.
4548 2018-08-17 00:59:04 This is how you reward your buddies. The military industrial complex is happy. A reward few weeks ago of additional $38 Billion to Israel.. Americans are on the back burner while he is in office..If it is any solace to anyone we should buy Military Companies stocks
4549 2018-08-17 00:57:17 Somebody PayPal me $1000 real quick so I can buy these stocks
4550 2018-08-17 00:57:07 Flat lol. I'm playing to the downside but do have calls in a couple stocks in case they fail at a dump
4551 2018-08-17 00:56:39 Belly up Phil.  Always a two drink minimum.  He'd do well to welcome the criticism by short sellers.  You should eval all the smart opinions from both sides.  Keeping in mind there are many more stocks with a last print of 0.00 vs. 1,000.
4552 2018-08-17 00:55:12 Why does my phone come with an app to look at stocks and why am I only noticing it after a year

4565 2018-08-17 00:39:28 It’s just amazing how they try to manipulate us.   Blame  down markets on turkey and buy over sold stocks into earnings.

4585 2018-08-17 00:14:54 There are stocks in the OTC that you can hold long term and gain. No one goes broke by taking profits. So take profits and don’t be greedy cuz pigs get slaughtered. Hope that helps.
4586 2018-08-17 00:13:50 Household debt in America now MORE than before 2008 meltdown. Corporate debt, stocks, materials all in bubble I suspect will lead to GIANT crash sometime relatively soon.

4588 2018-08-17 00:11:18 A very very arrogant thing to say. I'm not sure how you purchase stocks but I have a well developed system of LAWS not rules, which is I follow religiously combined with technical anaylsis.. not tweets seemed as financial advise.. that's how you lose your money..

4592 2018-08-17 00:06:29 To make the big dollars you are right but you gotta do your homework and know why you bought that stock. Plus you gotta have patience and position yourself in the right stocks. I am in the preserve wealth camp but I understand that logic and approach if you want to make wealth.
