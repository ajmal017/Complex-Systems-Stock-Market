40 2018-07-11 23:44:19 Your really going to try and say that the last $2.50 was justified with the current world stocks to use ratios. And really corn stocks to use the lowest since 1973 in the world. Fund money at work here.
41 2018-07-11 23:43:25 I think Pevant in defense for France  has been almost the best player of the tournament. His stocks will rise massively.

44 2018-07-11 23:40:40 not surprising. our stock market is over inflated & fancy ponzi  scheme.  people dont realize the numbers. if every stock owner traded in  their stocks for cash they would only get pennies on a $1000.00.  bill  gates and everyone else, are only worth the stock paper they own.
45 2018-07-11 23:40:18 FX SUMMARY: A FLURRY OF USD BUYING ALONG WITH LOWER GOLD, COMMODITIES AND STOCKS HAS PUSHED AUD BACK DOWN THROUGH THE KEY 0.7390-95 SUPPORT AS OIL LOSES 5% OVERNIGHT. EXPECT AUD TO BE CAPPED AROUND 0.7390-95 NOW AND LOOK FOR A TEST OF 0.7340.
46 2018-07-11 23:40:13 I might be weird, but I DO expect people to actually be careful with their money & only give it to people they trust. My $$ is with a financial manager I’ve had for years bc I don’t like researching stocks all day. I trust him. My risk is his reward. It works for everyone.
47 2018-07-11 23:39:27 @AT09_Trader in your opinion, what is the easiest penny stocks pattern for a beginner? New to this and want to make sure I do t make many mistakes in the beginning. (besides the 3 I already made).

49 2018-07-11 23:35:27 It's rare for someone to just have billions lying around even for rich people. A lot of their net worth is tied up in stocks in their company and things like that.

That said most billionaires improved the lives of millions of people.
50 2018-07-11 23:35:27 @ap @TheView @USATODAY Trump's FAILED disastrous trade WAR acts like a TRIP WIRE like a runaway TRAIN. The STUNNINGLY damaging TARIFFS raise the COST of GOODS.

ببساطة
إرتفاع أسعار النفط لا تعني فقط الإنتعاش وزيادة الطلب وهذا صحيح
ولكنها تعني أيضاً القرب من الدخول في مرحلة ركود إقتصادي
والحقيقة أن أوروبا تحديداً لم تتخلص بعد بشكل كامل من مرحلة الركود التي تلت الأزمة الإقتصادية
فهل تنطلق شرارة الركود من أوروبا هذه المرة؟
64 2018-07-11 23:21:39 The GOP's tricky maneuver with the bill passed today was meant to deceive. It will have no impact on what Trump has done. Global stocks dropped after the US released a list of $200 billion worth of Chinese exports subject to new ten percent tariffs.

90 2018-07-11 23:02:21 Either the economy is growing & commodities will be in strong demand or we are entering a recession just like in 2008.

137 2018-07-11 22:19:01 I agree that Congress needs to act. The propaganda comment was a bit harsh, I apologise. I guess I’ve become accustomed to people just repeating trump’s rhetoric, i.e. that if he says he doesn’t like bump stocks that means he has banned them, which hasn’t happened.
138 2018-07-11 22:17:46 Q 5: How much did the British value tea during the war?

281 2018-07-11 21:00:56 Why do people use stock dips as an indicator of anything. Dips are a momentary inconvenience, stocks trending downward over quarters are far more significant.

290 2018-07-11 20:56:57 Should I start investing money in stocks, go to law school, and campaign to become a senator?????
291 2018-07-11 20:56:38 His stocks plummeted in this world cup, contrary to Croatia's performance
292 2018-07-11 20:56:07 Why did they place a ban on short selling in stocks during the financial crisis if you didn’t actually own the stock? The answer is to protect the market from itself. Just not enough farmers as there were pension funds I guess.
293 2018-07-11 20:55:51 doing so, it will increase the STOCKS VALUE the illegitimate jackass of a PRESIDENT and his,WEALTHY friends have invested in the DEFENSE CORPORATIONS
294 2018-07-11 20:55:43 This is why their stocks are soaring and unlikely to stop. Their growth expectancies are incredible.
295 2018-07-11 20:55:32 But if stock has low volume isnt it easier to manipulate? For example BIOC today was basically dead and it doesnt take much to spark the sqeeze. Also we have seen lately these zombie stocks that grind up on low vol.

298 2018-07-11 20:54:32 I would race 4 cylinder street stocks, because if it all pays the same, I’m spending the least.
299 2018-07-11 20:54:15 You watch 6 different stocks on each monitor?!
300 2018-07-11 20:53:53 Thanks. I don’t trade sub-penny stocks. But these scanners will find them if that’s what your looking for. I have been using STT for the last year. I just switched to equityfeed last week. Both of those will find low priced stocks.
301 2018-07-11 20:53:45 It's basically showing the set knock back that you receive. I think it's fine, I like balloon knockback. 3 stocks will still be fine and better, especially when people learn the game more later instead of now in a demo.

308 2018-07-11 20:50:36 Because I short-sell hard to borrow stocks and that wouldn’t be possible with the brokers you mentioned. You need a broker that uses that right clearing firm to allocate the shares like Centerpoint securities or trade zero

Easily could be up average 10%, so 30% hit mostly over overblown trade tariff talk, media scam yes but worth it, really? Do it better
399 2018-07-11 20:07:40 I don't trade oil or give financial advise but am adding to oil E&P stocks on weakness although honestly most have not moved much today. This isn't real dude.

401 2018-07-11 20:07:10 Memo to my old friend Stephanie Link - referencing her valuation comments - 
Last year the S&P PE multiple expanded by nearly 3 points - and stocks were a buy during that expansionary phase.
This year the S&P PE multiple has contracted by 2 points - could stocks be a sale?
402 2018-07-11 20:06:57 #Earnings vs. #TradeWar smack down: 2Q earnings season starts with S&P Capital IQ forecasting 19.4% YoY gain in S&P 500 EPS. But possibility of a trade war could lead to elevated volatility, if not a threat to the market’s attempt to set a new high says @StovallCFRA #stocks

421 2018-07-11 19:57:13 Yes, those are good breadth numbers, but breadth thrusts are designed to be rare. 90% stocks >10MA only happens every few years at beginning of major moves. We got several after '09 lows due to a strong market and high correlations. But none for 2+yrs now.

532 2018-07-11 18:58:42 Sarah Rector, a former slave, inherited a rocky piece of land at the age of 12. Unknown to her, there was massive oil reserve under the land. By the time Sarah was eighteen years old she was a millionaire who owned stocks & bonds, a bakery, restaurant & over 2,000 acres of land.
533 2018-07-11 18:58:14 Fair, thanks.
Still, that only a large holding company -- not an actual endeavor with a commercial purpose beyond owning stocks -- is on that list still makes much of her point, I think.

939 2018-07-11 15:54:22 Went to a SBI Mutual Fund seminar yesterday. They talked of two of their funds — equity hybrid fund and a blue chip fund. The hybrid fund had 50% in large caps and 50% in mid/small cap stocks (and maybe a max of 10% in cash/debt) while the blue chip fund is all large caps.
940 2018-07-11 15:54:12 We wrote about that in March: In 2016, only about half of U.S. households owned stocks directly or indirectly, and “the richest 10 percent of households controlled 84 percent” of all stock value, according to a paper published last year by the National Bureau of Economic Research

968 2018-07-11 15:43:47 There are no certainties with investing.  Stocks over bonds isn't a certainty. Value over growth or small over large isn't a certainty. But it's what we expect, and investing is all about expectations.  We never expect concentrated/single asset portfolios to come out ahead

1090 2018-07-11 15:03:41 If you own individual stocks then (outside of the ETF wrapper, where you can redeem those stocks out at rebalance) you're getting hit with short term capital gains taxes on high turnover (less than one year holding periods) strategies.

1101 2018-07-11 15:00:08 And the tax efficiency! If you own individual stocks in high turnover strategies, you may run into issues with short term capital gains issues. 

Simplifying: if you're in a strategy that sells all stocks every 3 months, you're paying your income tax rate on those gains.

1110 2018-07-11 14:55:49 The same probably can't be said when optimizing within an asset class, for reasons described in the low vol/BAB literature.

For example returns to stocks are independent of beta and volatility (the relationship may even be inverted). So for stocks MinVol is probably MV-optimal.

1426 2018-07-11 13:15:43 Interesting. Why would someone not simply buy 2x the amount of shares they would've otherwise? or load up on 2x the number of of calls initially planned? (neither of which are sound investment approaches). I find it problematic that there are more ETF's then stocks.
1427 2018-07-11 13:15:37 I've spoken to accountants about this. Not possible with stocks, and you need a large amount of real estate to make it viable. Probably over 5 units. I know people with ~13 units owned personally  and they swear by it over a corporation

1441 2018-07-11 13:11:16 For sure. After the elimination of uptick rule in 2008 have seen more stocks with quick drops. This is why I'll sell SOME, NOT ALL, into strength. Then let the rest work/trend til it stops. And NO round trips after having a good gain.
1442 2018-07-11 13:10:51 Only reason stocks are still kinda treading water is because all the companies are still buying back their stocks.   The clock is running.....

1446 2018-07-11 13:09:52 ugh. This is why we can’t have nice things. But still transparent ETFs that list their holdings and just hold a basket of stocks - like a mutual fund- but with lower MER still net out most ideal.

1581 2018-07-11 11:43:36 @asibiza1 my thought exactly (and I too checked website to find nothing, fees wise).

Bundling fees is swimming against the current tide and therefore feels more like a marketing ploy. 

SJP (I suspect) 'absorb' platform fees too given their bundled charging structure.
1582 2018-07-11 11:43:17 i did watch, thanks, I support your view btw, but most of the reporting this morning on CNBC has indeed been stocks down "because of trade".
1583 2018-07-11 11:43:17 I have over 100 positions in various stocks that I have owned for as much as 25 years, futures hedges and option hedges. Not a practical suggestion, but thanks. Most nights I just let it go, but last night looked like it could get interesting.

1587 2018-07-11 11:42:21 Buffett invests in hundreds of stocks, even dozens of multi-billion holdings and can afford to take deep losses on a number of them. Most individual traders cannot successfully manage more than a dozen stocks and must be much more cautious and nimble.
1588 2018-07-11 11:42:18 1. I would say that has more to do with the current quota system under CFP which has been a disaster for EU fish stocks.
2. I love eels perhaps we can sell more domestically then.
1589 2018-07-11 11:41:24 Or...maybe you can get started reading all the good news you’ve been ignoring for months. 
1590 2018-07-11 11:41:15 A good indicator for what lies ahead for these stocks in coming quarters. I remember in 2015 when SunPharma and Lupin started falling, holdings by retail shareholders went up by 2-3x. And what happened to those stocks in 2016,2017 and 2018 is now part of history.

1595 2018-07-11 11:35:17 Not just that, he is factually wrong, there are massive trading volumes because the market has taken a massive down turn and stocks everywhere (including ad tech) have taken a hit today.

1599 2018-07-11 11:33:22 Looked at the LPL Financial website. It appears they partner with financial advisors to provide services: custodial, software (CRM, planning, accounting, etc.). Still doubt LPL picks stocks. I still think Ross' bad ideas are his own.

1601 2018-07-11 11:32:58 It is complete BS with stocks like Facebook or Amazon price going up that much, only bitcoin traders like to buy super expensive and worthless at the same time.
Bitcoin and Apple should serve as good exampel what happens eventually.

1612 2018-07-11 11:27:50 I can only advise you to listen again. The thrust of what he's saying is clear. According to the Sun's story, May's government is preparing for a no-deal Brexit by laying in stocks of preserved food. The Sun tries laughably to spin this as a strong negotiating position.

Buying has gathered steam in the last hour of trade, with the Sensex rising around 100 points, while the Nifty is well above 10,950-mark. A further surge in IT names, along with FMCG stocks have pushed up the market, but metals are seeing a selloff.

1628 2018-07-11 11:17:24 U.S. Stocks set to drop nearly 200 points after Trump threatens new tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods

U.S. stock index futures tanked ahead of Wednesday’s open, as a trade spat between the U.S. and other major economies intensified.
1629 2018-07-11 11:16:37 It's another down day for stocks across the globe after the Trump administration raised the stakes in its trade war with China, saying it would slap 10% tariffs on an extra $200B worth of Chinese imports.

The list targets important manufacturing export industries

1677 2018-07-11 10:41:14 If you are referring to bump stocks, Trump signed an executive order and Sessions issued a directive to ATFE to change its definition of automatic weapons to include bump stock like devices. That's not a ban per se, but it is pushing the limit of executive authority.
1678 2018-07-11 10:40:45 But the volume signature of the indicies and leading stocks is so bearish it is unreal. Big above average red bars all over the place and very low volume on up days. So how come the markets still go higher? Today could be another red distribution day in the making!
1679 2018-07-11 10:39:17 Makes me sad really that;
1. I have a massive paper loss
2. @colhutch isnt really communicating what his shareholders need to hear... from the way he deports himself on interviews he lacks an effective businessman approch... he hasn't  the fire or fight in him. #AST @AscentRes

1685 2018-07-11 10:31:34 Stocks slide probably because big indices couldn't stay above their 200-dma. EuroStoxx50 on it's way to test febuary/march lows?! Looks like a nice top-formation there. DAX and CAC too. #bearmarket #latestage #downturn #boombust #StockMarket

1687 2018-07-11 10:30:56 We will be able to provide a larger quota of U.K. fishing stocks to U.K. fishermen - therefore more fishermen + fishing boats will be required. The Fisheries Bill stated “Enable the U.K. to control access to its waters and set U.K. fishing quotas once it has left the EU.

1695 2018-07-11 10:19:34 Two conflicting narratives this a.m. as Trump brandishes point-of-no-return trade wars with China, CNY -0.7%, taking stocks down, while German Chancellor Merkel praises UK PM May’s new Brexit proposal and markets misprice BoE rates risk just 3 wks away. Just a normal Wednesday

1699 2018-07-11 10:16:58 Most people in crypto gained their first trading experiences in the crazy and strong bull-market last summer.
They are simply spoiled and expecting this all the time.

Someone who traded traditional stocks or something else before don't care about the current situation.

1709 2018-07-11 10:09:31 I think as long as the stock market continues to do "well" people will hesitate getting in to crypto. I see a steady decline in value stocks for numerous reasons. As people see those deteriorate they will move to crypto - so I just say get them here first.

1734 2018-07-11 09:50:05 The stats showing a small amount of % US defence on Europe are bogus - what is the NATO plan in the event of war? It relies on massive reinforcements from the US. How long, for instance , would European missile stocks last without US help? Look at Op Ellamy.

1741 2018-07-11 09:42:35 Trump acted vulnerable when stocks declined, not sure if he knows about these Intermarket dependencies though. Recent weak 3y auction could be a message from China IMHO.

Explain please exactly why you want people to purchase bump-stocks. I’d like to know when you think that these would be useful for the average citizen. 
Are you thinking? At all?
1927 2018-07-11 06:57:03 Asia stocks fell along with the Yuan. The Nikkei closed down 1.23% with HK down 1.7% and Shanghai down 2.25% at last look.
1928 2018-07-11 06:56:57 Asia stocks fell along with the Yuan. The Nikkei closed down 1.23% with HK down 1.7% and Shanghai down 2.25% at last look.
1929 2018-07-11 06:56:32 This basically means that holding stocks in the 90-100 rank range is inherently risky. It will hurt even more if the overall large cap allocation is close to the prescribed limits. Over a period of time, average large cap holding in large cap funds should cross 90%.

1933 2018-07-11 06:54:59 The Dow is a tricky one as like the Dax with only 30 constituents it can be moved by individual stocks .. i prefer the S&P 500 ... being short is the obvious answer but from where? ideally into strength..personally i would not chase it but wait for exhaustion and buy the dips...
1934 2018-07-11 06:54:46 So it's worth pointing out that on average bonds are a superior investment choice when compared with stocks, largely because of how fiscal push back tends to excise returns in the inverse.

2042 2018-07-11 05:26:45 I’m here now. I’ve always been here. Generations of my family have been here. None of like tariffs making us pay more then get taxed more for the things we already own or the things we need to do our jobs. None of us like that tariff money buying more stocks for the elite.
2043 2018-07-11 05:23:04 Bump stocks and high cap magazines are emotional items that account for such a tiny fraction of deaths. 

You could enforce just two laws already on the books and save 10X that number.

2081 2018-07-11 04:41:13 I think you can find many stocks in traditional markets which are over valued but crypto gets a bad name for being overvalued.

2104 2018-07-11 04:24:03 There’s more jobs because less immigrants can get job visas. Temp, seasonal, and manual labor jobs are up. Wage growth is still less than inflation so cost of living is up.

B. Apple isn't that overvalued, compared the growth of other tech stocks & Relative to s&p500.

2131 2018-07-11 04:01:46 One statistic about the Bots the stocks the they buy are taken over at a rate 3 times higher than the normal take over rate in the S&P500 universe. Luck or Skill? Remember they have no idea of the why.
May be this gives you a hint of why probabilities matter more than the why.

2133 2018-07-11 04:01:00 Apple does not pay a dividend of $525 a year "issa lie". The demand for Jordan's due to the precieved value and limited supply keeps demand high no different than diamonds. Perception is harder to quantify....apple stocks are valued by hard qualifiers.

2137 2018-07-11 03:57:14 I'd bet for it.  Momentum stocks that close strongly have generally done well lately as overnight gap plays.  But yeah, the exceptions can be brutal. $STAF ran after hours and didn't even have any overhead resistance.  Gapping down almost 40%? Crazy.
2138 2018-07-11 03:55:13 The yuan, commodities, and chinese stocks slump as US-China trade wars escalate, meaning everything goes according to plan.
2139 2018-07-11 03:54:42 Fair point. Fact of the matter is this isn’t a “new molecule” being taken from point A to B so data reporting and analysis should be fairly straight forward once the data is unlocked to the company. I suppose clinical stage  bio companies are going bio and go last minute

2241 2018-07-11 02:45:34 Isn’t amazing how stocks have priced in perfection with earnings? Margin debt is at a high as well. So so dangerous and so many people fail to realize how fragile the market really is. Things are about to get fun :-)
2242 2018-07-11 02:45:16 Neck braces are cheap, and I suggest Wall Street has a warehouse full of them.  Stay the course -consumer confidence rules the market and is higher now than in 20 years.

2335 2018-07-11 01:44:58 * A GOP congress will never impeach for what Mueller investigation shows.

2366 2018-07-11 01:23:25 I'm not rooting for the economy to collapse but when Trumps trade war causes the cost of living to sky rocket that extra bit of money in your pay check is going to vanish. It will expose the fraud of his tax plan. Consumer spending will slow. Crashing stocks will follow.

2398 2018-07-11 01:01:42 He got mad stocks in Power I'm assuming. I'm scared to even tell people I don't watch #Empire they may try and pull up on me and I can't fight so I'm basically fucked All Over A Show.

2403 2018-07-11 00:56:14 I don't play with cannabis stocks (too hard to manage conflicts of interest). But short-term there will always be corrections. Long-term, however, I think we're barely at the start of a massive global industry.
2404 2018-07-11 00:55:26 Make a law that oil cannot be traded as a commodity in the US. Fix the price. Then maybe investors will invest in a factory? Making money from nothing is crap. (jealous). Commodities and stocks do more harm then good for the workers.
2405 2018-07-11 00:55:16 $SPY $UVXY looks like now is the time to get short as this right shoulder forms and takes stocks lower
2406 2018-07-11 00:55:04 Also, stocks vs flows. One day an example will be so egregious I'll just keep over dead.
2407 2018-07-11 00:52:51 International funds were net buyers of $161m in South Korea-listed bonds on July 9,  net buyers of $61.2m in nation’s stocks on July 10.
2408 2018-07-11 00:52:34 @SJosephBurns quick question. What was the determining factor in trading stocks over let’s say futures or currencies?
2409 2018-07-11 00:49:53 Hey I’m very interested in this could you dm some more info on stocks
2410 2018-07-11 00:49:49 Awesome! I currently do not invest in individual stocks, I have not done enough research to feel comfortable investing.
2411 2018-07-11 00:48:00 Stocks are doing great for now* he’s implementing the same policies that caused a bomb/bust that Reagan and Bush used. Time will tell

2414 2018-07-11 00:44:52 You, my friend, are always on point. You have taught me more about the Feds buying bonds n affecting the stocks and thus, the yield curve flattening. I plan to wait till we can use “puts” on spy and I will pay it forward. Thank you sir.
2415 2018-07-11 00:44:13 Nauubos na ung stocks nung mga nasa cart ko sa shopee. Wala pa rin ung inaasahan kong pera. Kainis.
2416 2018-07-11 00:44:00 Stocks are down for the year which means 401k and thrift plans are down. You’re concern for my finances is truly touching!
2417 2018-07-11 00:41:00 i honestly wanna play a lot of people, not just my friends. i just wanna show people i have some unique talent with falcon in this game. if i’m offline and moving like m o v i n g, and making the right calls and getting max damage/stocks in combos i’m unstoppable sometimes.

2420 2018-07-11 00:36:42 Remember a few years ago when congress voted AGAINST themselves being banned from owning stocks? It reminded me of the time they voted AGAINST themselves being required to have Obamacare. They deserve better than us, you know. F-ing criminals indeed!

2421 2018-07-11 00:35:42 Haven’t done much reading or research about non blockchain investments.

I’ll start looking into possibilities in DNA sequencing. Cannabis stocks. Virtual & Augmented reality over next coming months.

2427 2018-07-11 00:31:57 True stocks are important but my mans buying 1 piece of stock ain’t changing much, when bro has 20+ stock in different companies then he can tweet all this, and he on acorn, he not really even investing you get free stock for inviting friends  I had that app in high school
2428 2018-07-11 00:31:55 Great Job Frank! She's such an Amazing Artist! Thanks so much! Hope you're doing well? Stocks are looking pretty good! 
2429 2018-07-11 00:31:44 Sometimes I wonder why I buy other stocks...
2430 2018-07-11 00:31:07 @Twitter has been cracking down on fake and suspicious accounts This could lead to a decline in the monthly active users My twitter stocks fell nearly 9% Monday 
2431 2018-07-11 00:30:54 Fund companies like Mutual funds run by Vanguard and American Funds are heavily invested in FF stocks. The objective of divestment is to lower demand which lowers the stock price, and to remove these companies' social license.
2432 2018-07-11 00:30:07 Really? How many issues or incidents as Hawaii had with bump stocks?

2435 2018-07-11 00:28:39 I hope instagrams stocks and profits absolutely tank after adding questions to stories god damnit
2436 2018-07-11 00:28:38 Yes. Market "talk." Stocks "talk."  We just have to  "listen," with no bias.
2437 2018-07-11 00:28:28 This entire Trump dictatorship is unprecedented. I won’t even talk to my own family, and now some friends. They all say he same thing. I don’t like him, but he’s a good business man, he’s creating jobs, and their stocks are doing well. JFC
2438 2018-07-11 00:28:24 Stocks atsaka mutual funds!!
2439 2018-07-11 00:27:12 lmao penny stocks
2440 2018-07-11 00:26:36 From now on, I pick funds over stocks to focus on. My stock only portfolio I made years ago has had horrible return. I either had no idea what I was doing back then or I should have put more money in the system. It's probably both though tbh.
2441 2018-07-11 00:26:07 Listen @Starbucks, this whole 'ditch the plastic straws' is great and all, but maybe you can also think about having all stores have enough reusable cold cups in stocks so we CAN ditch the straws earlier than 2020.
2442 2018-07-11 00:24:47 I’m so glad my ex and I are in good terms, he just Got a new position overseeing Latin American markets and stocks.
2443 2018-07-11 00:24:30 Lol!  How did it eventually end?  Stocks go down way faster so I’m excited to trade down
2444 2018-07-11 00:24:20 This guy on IHUB "867moneytime" may be the worst trader I have seen in a long time lol, All hits stocks are down. And when he does get in the stocks have already topped off. lolol what a joke.
2445 2018-07-11 00:23:43 $SPY this tariff crap is why I picked stocks with really low or negative beta this week
2446 2018-07-11 00:22:08 These trade war rhetoric offers good opportunities for swing trades especially with tech stocks since past few months or so. Again BTD slowly and sell on spikes. Hoping tech money moves into bios though low volume during summer make it vulnerable for irrational pullback too
2447 2018-07-11 00:21:35 Did you know you could hold that pair of shoes depending on rarity for a little longer and make back wayyyy more than what some stocks might get you?

2452 2018-07-11 00:18:18 New meme on the rise, invest now while stocks are low 
2453 2018-07-11 00:16:50 Any financial advice? Which stocks or cryptocurrencies should I invest in? #RandomThingsToAskAStranger
2454 2018-07-11 00:15:17 Yup. That's all that matters. Those stocks. Keep that shortsightedness coming. Im also someone who benefits from a positive stock market, yet some of us are able to look at things with real world glasses and not just care about making my life better, right now. R's always tank it
2455 2018-07-11 00:15:16 considering the level of leverage it requires and the risks one needs to take.
The stock market is a completely different beast! You hold liquid assets and can manage your risk exposure the way you want. That's why I rent BUT still invest in stocks

2459 2018-07-11 00:13:26 DAYBREAK CIRCLE stocks slump
2460 2018-07-11 00:13:09 Anyone who experienced a loss in stocks today was it psychological or just unpredictable?
2461 2018-07-11 00:13:07 Thank you for reaching Shopee Philippines. Rest assured that the seller updates the stocks as soon as item is made available. Have a nice day!
2462 2018-07-11 00:12:40 sure, but then you've got proletarians who hold stocks in companies and government bonds, and basically every person owns productive machinery. the distinction doesn't distinguish anything anymore. everyone is a bourgeois.
2463 2018-07-11 00:12:12 Trump started a new company, “Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts” went public and raised $400 million in stocks. He then used that company to buy his two failing casinos from himself, saddling his new public company with what was his private debt, and promptly went Bankrupt again.
2464 2018-07-11 00:11:39 What app are those stocks on
2465 2018-07-11 00:11:00 Must be the company making your Pfiagra and Pfrogaine and you prob  have stocks, show taxes! Really, get hyped about one drug company out of all of them? Excited publicly about a 'prospect' and can't step up reuniting the children with their mothers?
2466 2018-07-11 00:10:49 still trying to figure out is the $RTY the only index that reads the tariff news?  
They were holding the Spoo Pigs up like they were magic beans or something, then suddenly old tariff news matters... seems like someone was on the bid dumping stocks
2467 2018-07-11 00:10:20  could've gone either way. Welcome to the world of stocks

Also, the share prices of Copper stocks are 'Falling as well!!!!!  Yet the Nasdaq and S&P Indexes are 'Steadily
